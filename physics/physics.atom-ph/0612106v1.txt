Abstract. We describe the current status of high-precision ab initio calculations of the
spectra of molecular hydrogen ions (H+
2 and HD+) and of two experiments for vibra-
tional spectroscopy. The perspectives for a comparison between theory and experiment
at a level of 1 ppb are considered.

1 Introduction

The molecular hydrogen ion (MHI) is the simplest stable molecule, containing
just two nuclei and a single electron. Since the birth of the ﬁeld of molecu-
lar physics it has played an important role: it is on one hand an important
benchmark system for detailed studies of energy levels [1], for collisions and
chemical reactions between charged molecules and neutral atoms/molecules, of
interactions with laser radiation and energetic charged particles, and for testing
the respective theoretical descriptions. On the other hand, the MHI is also an
astrophysically important molecule, involved in reaction chains leading to the
production of polyatomic molecules. Over 800 publications have been written on
this molecule in the last 35 years [2]. The large majority are theoretical studies.
Concerning high-resolution spectroscopy of MHIs, only a limited number of
investigations have been carried out, most of which a long time ago. Radiofre-
quency spectroscopy of the hyperﬁne structure in several vibrational levels has
been performed on H+
2 trapped in a Paul trap [3]; several low-lying fundamental
ro-vibrational transitions of HD+ have been measured using laser spectroscopy
on an ion beam [4], while rotational and ro-vibrational transitions of H+
2 , D+
2
and HD+ close to the dissociation limit were investigated using microwave and
laser spectroscopy, also on an ion beam [5,6]. The highest spectroscopic accura-
cies reported so far were achieved in the experiments of Jeﬀerts and of Wing et

al. [4,7], ≃ 1·10−6 in relative units. Recently, also the dissociation energies have
been obtained with accuracies ≃ 1 · 10−6 [8]. Thus, the experimental accuracies
have been far less than those achieved in hydrogen or helium spectroscopy.

In the late 1990s, it was recognized that there are attractive reasons and
many opportunities to study MHIs in novel ways and to achieve a much higher
precision than previously possible [9]. Several techniques, not used before on
MHIs, appeared to be applicable, including translational cooling, internal cool-
ing, spectroscopy with reduced Doppler broadening, Doppler-free spectroscopy,
high sensitivity ion detection. Novel laser systems not available at the time of
the last precision spectroscopic studies can be used advantageously, among them
diode lasers, quantum cascade lasers and the femtosecond frequency comb. The
prospect of signiﬁcantly improved experimental precision has also motivated us
to develop more extended theoretical treatments of the MHI; in the course of
these eﬀorts, the accuracy of the energy levels has been increased by approxi-
mately two orders of magnitude compared to previous work.

Some of the above techniques have by now been implemented, and are re-
ported here; the remaining appear to be feasible in the near future. These recent
developments open up a number of novel applications of MHIs:

(i) test advanced ab initio molecular calculations (in particular, QED contribu-

tions)

ment)

(ii) measure certain fundamental constants
(iii) test concepts for the manipulation of molecules (state preparation, align-

(iv) sense ﬁelds (blackbody radiation [10])
(v) probe fundamental physics laws (e.g. Lorentz Invariance [11], time invari-

ance of fundamental constants [12,13])

(vi) study electric dipole interactions between molecules [14]
(vii) explore elastic, reactive and charge exchange collisions with neutral atoms

and molecules at ultralow collision energies

The successful demonstration of manipulation of MHIs at the quantum state
level could also open up the possibility to study collisions with quantum-state
resolution, i.e. where all parent particles are in speciﬁc quantum states.

An attractive perspective of our work pursued under (i) is to eventually de-
termine the ratios of electron-to-proton mass (me/mp), proton-to-deuteron mass
(mp/md) and proton-to-triton mass (mp/mt) from a comparison between accu-
rate experimental and theoretical energy level data. The basis for this possibility
is the dependence of the vibrational and rotational transition frequencies on the
fundamental constants. For fundamental vibrational and rotational transitions,
the frequencies scale approximately as

h νvib ∼

me/µ R∞ ,

h νrot ∼ (me/µ)R∞ ,

where µ = M1M2/(M1 + M2) is the reduced mass of the two nuclei and R∞
is the Rydberg energy. The precise dependencies have been computed in refs.

[12,15,16]. The mass ratios mp/md, mp/mt and me/mp are conventionally deter-
mined by Penning ion trap mass spectrometry on single particles or by electron
spin resonance of single hydrogen-like ions in a Penning ion trap. Relative accu-
racies are currently 2.0 · 10−10 [17], 2 · 10−9, and 4.6 · 10−10 [17,18], respectively.
Note that in case of me/mp, the determination involves the use of QED [19].
Clearly, the corresponding accuracies of νvib, νrot represent the goal levels for
our ongoing experimental and theoretical eﬀorts on H+

2 and HD+.

Several aspects support the expectation that such accuracies can be reached
in the near future. First, the lifetimes of vibrational levels are long, the shortest
ones occurring for low-lying levels in HD+, ≃ 10 ms. The relative linewidth
due to spontaneous decay is thus of the order or smaller than 10−13. Second,
Doppler broadening can be strongly reduced or eliminated by either cooling the
molecular ions or by performing two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy. Finally,
collision broadening and time-of-ﬂight broadening can also be minimized by both
cooling and providing a good ultra-high vacuum environment. Systematic shifts
due to light ﬁelds, trap electric ﬁelds, and trap and environmental magnetic
ﬁelds will need to be considered; hereby it will be helpful that these inﬂuences
be calculated accurately, using the relative simplicity of the MHI. The theoretical
determination of the energy levels at the goal accuracy level will need as input
nuclear properties such as the proton and deuteron nuclear radii, which may be
obtained e.g. from hydrogen spectroscopy or nuclear scattering experiments.

In this contribution we present an overview of our theoretical and experi-
mental results achieved recently on MHIs. Chapter 2 describes the theoretical
approaches for a precise computation of energy levels, including hyperﬁne and
QED eﬀects and the computation of one- and two-photon spectra. Chapter 3
presents the development and results from an experiment for trapping and spec-
troscopy of H+
2 performed at the Universit´e d’Evry Val d’Essonne. Chapter 4
summarizes an experiment on HD+ at the University of D¨usseldorf.

2 Ab initio theory of H+

2 and HD+

The dissociation energies of 462 states in H+
2 and 619 in HD+ in a wide range of v
and L, vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, have been calculated some
time ago by R.E. Moss [20,21] with a relative accuracy of ∼ 5·10−9 (including
the leading order relativistic and radiative corrections). Later the numerical
precision of the nonrelativistic energies have been improved up to 10−15 − 10−24
a.u. [12,15,22–26] by using variational methods. The ultimate accuracy of ∼
10−24 a.u. has been obtained for the H+
2 ground state [26]. These calculations
demonstrate that at least the nonrelativistic ro-vibrational transition frequencies
can be determined with an uncertainty well below the 1 kHz level. In this section
we describe the calculation of QED corrections as an expansion in terms of α, the
ﬁne structure constant. The numerical method exploits a variational approach
based on the Slater-type exponents as basis functions. We demonstrate that
the frequencies of ro-vibrational transitions can be obtained in this way with a
precision better than 1 part per billion (ppb).

2.1 Variational expansion

The variational bound state wave functions are calculated by solving the three-
body Schr¨odinger equation with Coulomb interaction using the variational ap-
proach based on the exponential expansion with randomly chosen exponents.
Details and the particular strategy of choice of the variational nonlinear param-
eters and basis structure that have been adopted in the present work can be
found in [23].

Brieﬂy, the wave function for a state with a total orbital angular momentum

L and of a total spatial parity π = (−1)L is expanded as follows:

LM ( ˆR, ˆr1) = Rl1rl2

Here Y l1l2
1 {Yl1 ⊗ Yl2 }LM are the solid bipolar harmonics, R is
the position vector of nucleus 2 relative to nucleus 1, and r1, r2 are positions of
an electron relative to nuclei 1 and 2, respectively. The complex exponents, α,
β, γ, are generated in a pseudorandom way.

When the exponents αn, βn, and γn are real, the method reveals slow con-
vergence for molecular type Coulomb systems. The use of complex exponents
allows to reproduce the oscillatory behaviour of the vibrational part of the wave
function and to improve convergence [27,23].

The advantage of choice (2) is the simplicity of the basis functions. It al-
lows evaluating analytically matrix elements of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian and
the leading-order radiative corrections and, more importantly, to treat in a sys-
tematic way the singular integrations encountered in higher-order contributions
[28].

2.2 Leading-order relativistic and radiative corrections

Relativistic corrections of the leading R∞α2 order, the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian,
are well known and can be found in many textbooks [29,30]. The nuclear ﬁ-
nite size eﬀects are considered as contributions to this order. Details, relevant
particularly to the case of the MHIs, can be found in [31].

In what follows we assume that the nuclear charges are Z1 = Z2 = Z = 1 and
nuclear masses are denoted by capital M . The units adopted are (¯h = e = me = 1).
The radiative corrections of an order R∞α3 for a one electron molecular

system can be expressed by the following set of equations (see Refs. [32–34]).

problem in computation of QED corrections for the three-body bound states. In
[34,35] the calculations for a wide range of ro-vibrational states in H+
2 and HD+
have been performed to an accuracy of about 7 signiﬁcant digits. The operator
J in (4) is the electric current density operator of the system1. The last term,
Q(r), in Eq. (3) is the mean value of a regularized operator introduced by Araki
and Sucher [36] for the 1/(4πr3) potential:

2.3 R∞α4 order corrections in the nonrecoil limit

The contribution of recoil corrections, proportional to (m/M ), in the R∞α4
order are too small for our present consideration and may be neglected. Radia-
tive corrections for a bound electron in an external ﬁeld are known analytically

The last equation includes both the Dirac form factor and polarization operator
contributions.

The R∞α4 relativistic correction is obtained using the adiabatic ”eﬀective”
potential for an mα6 term in the α expansion of the two-center Dirac energy
(see Fig. 1). Averaging over the squared wave function density of a state one
gets E(4)
rc . The adiabatic potentials have been obtained recently with about 5
signiﬁcant digits [37], and the Born-Oppenheimer solution yields approximate
wave functions at the (m/M ) ≈ 10−4 level, which allows to claim that E(4)
is

now known to 4 digits.

Some higher order radiative corrections for a bound electron in an exter-
nal ﬁeld are also known in an analytic form [38,39] and can be included into
consideration:

and B50 = −21.556 . . . [42] (see also Ref. [39] and references therein). The ﬁnal
theoretical uncertainty in the transition frequency (see Table 1) is determined
by the total contribution of the last two equations.

2.4 Hyperﬁne structure of states

The leading order contribution to the hyperﬁne splitting of the ro-vibrational
states is calculated using the spin-dependent part of the Breit-Pauli interaction
Hamiltonian, with phenomenological values for the nuclear magnetic moments
and the electron anomalous magnetic moment. The hyperﬁne levels of HD+,
EvLF SJ , are labelled with the quantum numbers F , S and J of the intermediate
angular momenta F = Ip+se, S = F+Id and of the total angular momentum J =
L + S [43]. In case of H+
2 due to Pauli exclusion principle the total nuclear spin I
is uniquely deﬁned by L and parity of the electronic state. The following coupling
scheme is adopted: F = I+se and J = L+F [44]. The hyperﬁne structure (HFS)
of the ro-vibrational states of HD+ consists of 4, 10 or 12 hyperﬁne sub-levels
for L = 0, L = 1 and L ≥ 2, respectively (see Fig. 2). The multiplicity of the HFS
of H+
2 is reduced to 1 for L = 0, 5 for L = 1, 2 for even, and 6 for odd L states.
Typically, the hyperﬁne splitting of the lower ro-vibrational states of HD+ and
H+
2 is about 1 GHz. The uncertainty in the hyperﬁne spectrum is related to the
unknown contribution of the spin interaction terms of orders O(R∞α4(m/M ))
and higher, which have not yet been taken into consideration, and is estimated
not to exceed 100 kHz.

Each transition line between ro-vibrational states is split into a multiplet of
hyperﬁne components, corresponding to the allowed transitions i → f between

the states of the hyperﬁne structure of the initial and ﬁnal states. Whether these
hyperﬁne components will be resolved or the spectrum proﬁle depends on the
initial and ﬁnal state lifetime and on the experimental conditions (transition
linewidth Γf , laser intensity I, temperature, interaction time etc.) Examples of
spectral data are presented in experimental sections of our review (see Fig. 13).
The shape of the proﬁle also depends on the population of the initial hyperﬁne
states. The general expressions for the probability per unit time for one- and
two-photon transitions between ro-vibrational states of the MHIs with account
of the hyperﬁne structure are given in Ref. [45].

The probability per unit time for the hyperﬁne transition i → f at resonance
(averaged over the magnetic numbers of initial and ﬁnal states), Γf,i, may be

The hyperﬁne structure of the one- and two-photon transition lines includes
a large number of components, most of which, however, are suppressed. There
are as well dominant (or “favoured”) transitions between states with similar
spin structure, such as (vLF J) → (v′L′F J ′) with ∆J = ∆L (for H+
2 ). In such
pairs of homologous hyperﬁne states the spin-dependent corrections to the ro-
vibrational energies Ev′L′F J ′ and EvLF J have close values, which partially cancel
each other when evaluating the spin correction to the resonance transition fre-
quency (Ev′L′F J ′ − EvLF J )/h. Indeed, the favoured hyperﬁne transitions span
over a frequency interval less than 25 MHz (see Fig 3). It is natural to expect
that the unknown contributions to the frequency of the favoured transitions from
the spin interactions of order R∞α4(m/M ) and higher also tend to cancel each
other; therefore, the theoretical uncertainty of the resonance frequency of the
favoured hyperﬁne sublines will be less than ∼ 5 kHz.

2.5 Two-photon transition probabilities
In order to assess the feasibility of Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy in H+
2
or HD+, it is essential to evaluate transition probabilities between ro-vibrational
states. This can be done using the formula from second-order perturbation the-
ory [46], and the accurate wavefunctions provided by variational calculations.
Assuming that magnetic sublevels are equally populated, the two-photon tran-
sition probability at resonance between states v, L and v′, L′ is

Here, E = [E(v, L) + E(v′, L′)]/2 is the one-photon resonance energy and ǫ the
exciting ﬁeld polarization. The two-photon transition probabilities were calcu-
lated in [22,47].
For the H+

2 case [47] there exists a quasi-selection rule ∆v = ±1, and the
dimensionless transition probabilities Qv,L,v′,L′ are rather small, of the order
of 1, which is due to the level structure of H+
2 . If we consider the example
of transitions between L = 0 states, these states are of 1Se symmetry, and
there is no resonant intermediate level of 1P o symmetry that could enhance the
transition probability.

The situation is diﬀerent in the HD+ case [22], since there is no splitting
between singlet and triplet state due to the loss of exchange symmetry between
the nuclei. As a result, for a transition between L = 0 (Se) states, there exist
intermediate bound Po levels which can be very close in energy and eﬃciently
enhance the transition probability. This is most likely to happen if the diﬀerence
between v and v′ (the initial and ﬁnal vibrational quantum numbers) is an even
number. In this case, the state (v′′ = (v + v′)/2, L′′ = L ± 1) is often close to
the middle energy E = [E(v, L) + E(v′, L′)]/2, because of the quasi-harmonic
structure of vibrational levels. As a result, some of the most intense two-photon
lines are ∆v = 2 transitions in the 5-6 µm range or ∆v = 4 transitions in the 2.5-
3 µm range, accessible e.g. with continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator
or quantum cascade lasers. The dimensionless transition probabilities Qv,L,v′,L′
can reach values as high as 300 for the (v = 0, L = 1) → (v = 2, L = 1) transition
at 5.366 µm. Thus, the HD+ molecular ion is a promising candidate for precise
two-photon spectroscopy.

The next step is to consider the hyperﬁne structure of two-photon transition

lines. The representation of the hyperﬁne state vectors in the H+

L states (Fig. 3(b)) have a much simpler structure, the total nuclear spin be-

(verifying ∆J = 0) together with two weak satellites. Transitions between L = 0

logical point of view.

3 Two-photon spectroscopy of H+
2

A two-photon vibrational spectroscopy experiment aimed at the determination
of the electron to proton mass ratio is being setup at the Kastler Brossel Labo-
ratory. We begin by recalling the basic spectral features of the MHI, and discuss
the planned experimental sequence. In the second part, we report on the present
status of the experimental setup. It is composed of a hyperbolic Paul trap in
which a few thousand H+
2 ions can be conﬁned, a UV laser for ion preparation
and detection by state-selective photodissociation, and a narrow-line, tunable
laser system that will excite the two-photon transition.

3.1 H+

2 level structure

Although the Born Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is not relevant for highly
accurate calculations, it remains a very convenient tool to get a useful insight
into the H+
2 level structure. In order to understand the processes discussed here,
it is enough to consider the ﬁrst two BO electronic curves: the ground state 1sσg
and ﬁrst excited state 2pσu, which are depicted in Fig. 4.

The exact symmetries of the system are the total spatial parity π and the
exchange of nuclei P12; the g/u electronic parity πe used in the BO approach is re-
lated to them by πe = πP12. The bound levels of H+
2 can be labelled v, (2I+1Le,o)
where v and L are the vibrational and orbital quantum numbers, I is the total
nuclear spin quantum number and (e, o) stands for the total parity. Since the
total spatial parity is π = (−1)L, the 1sσg curve only supports 1Se, 3P o, 1De . . .

Fig. 5. Photodissociation cross sections of the L = 0, v levels of H+
2 . The dashed lines
are the result of a Born Oppenheimer calculation [50], which takes the 1sσg and 2pσu
electronic curves into account. The nodal structure of the cross section reﬂects that
of the vibrational wavefunction. The solid lines are obtained from an exact variational
method which fully takes into account the three body dynamics [51]. The additional
nodal structure appearing in the short wavelength domain can be interpreted as the
photodissociation to higher excited electronic states (3dσg, 2pπu, 4f σu, . . . ). The dot-
dashed vertical line corresponds to the KrF laser wavelength of 248 nm.

The 2pσu electronic curve presents at large internuclear distances a weak
attractive potential that supports two bound L = 0 energy levels [20,48]. Some of
those states have been observed by microwave or laser spectroscopy experiments
[49]. At higher L the 2pσu potential supports bound or dissociative 1P o, 3De
1F o . . . states that can be calculated numerically using either the variational, or
the complex coordinate rotation method.

3.2 One-photon transitions: photodissociation

The selection rules for one-photon dipole transitions are ∆L = ±1 and ∆I = 0.
As a consequence, transitions between bound ro-vibrational states of H+
2 are for-
bidden (in contrast with the HD+ case), resulting in very long-lived states. On
the other hand, one-photon photodissociation transitions from 1sσg to 2pσu elec-
tronic states are allowed. The photodissociation cross sections σv of the (1Se, v)
states have been ﬁrst computed by Dunn [50] in the Born-Oppenheimer approx-
imation, and then using the perimetric coordinate variational method in [51].
The results are given in Fig. 5. They show that a laser source in the 250 nm
range can be used to selectively photodissociate the v = 1, 2, 3, . . . vibrational
states while keeping the ions in the v = 0 level since the successive cross section
ratios σv+1/σv are 214, 40, 10, for v = 0, 1, 2, respectively.

3.3 Two-photon transitions: choice of the transition

One-photon transitions between bound states being forbidden, a high resolution
study of the vibrational structure of H+
2 is only possible using Doppler-free two-
photon spectroscopy. Two-photon transitions obey the selection rule ∆L = 0, ±2

Spectroscopy of the Hydrogen Molecular Ions.

13

as well as the quasi selection rule ∆v = ±1, as discussed in section 2.5. The
corresponding (v, L) → (v′ = v +1, L′) transition frequencies lie in the 8-12 µm
range. Among them, we have chosen to probe the v = 0 → v = 1 transitions, for
L and L′ equal to 0 or 2 and eventually 1 or 3. We now give the arguments that
explain this choice.

The ﬁrst condition to fulﬁll is that it should be possible to prepare a large
enough number of H+
2 in the initial state of the transition. The ro-vibrational
populations of H+
2 ions, after creation by electron impact ionization of a low pres-
sure H2 gas, have been studied both theoretically and experimentally [52]. The
vibrational populations are linked to the overlap of the H2 and H+
2 vibrational
wave functions (Franck-Condon principle); they are found to be of the order of
12, 18, 18, 15, 11, 8, 5, 4% for the ﬁrst few levels. The rotational populations of
the H+
2 ions are those of the H2 mother molecules, i.e. 12, 28, 28, 18, 8% at 300
K. Moreover, we have shown in the previous paragraph that UV photodissocia-
tion provides a convenient way to prepare ions in the ground vibrational state;
it is then desirable to choose a v = 0 state as initial state of the transition, with
L between 0 and 3, L = 1 or 2 being the best choices with respect to the number
of ions. The same photodissociation process can be used to detect the ions in
the excited v = 1 state.

The hyperﬁne structure of two-photon lines should also be considered; it is
apparent from Fig. 3 that it is simpler for transitions between even L states.
Interpretation of experimental data is likely to be easier in this case.

The intensities of the various (v = 0, L) → (v′ = 1, L′) (with low L) two-
photon lines are of the same magnitude; the choice of a particular transition
depends mostly on the availability and characteristics of laser sources at the
required wavelength. The whole mid-infrared range is accessible by the recently
developed quantum cascade lasers (QCL); L′ = L transitions are especially at-
tractive, because they lie within the spectrum of CO2 lasers (λ ≃ 9-10 µm).
Also, a number of frequency reference molecular absorption lines are known in
this range [53]. The ﬁrst transition that is going to be probed in our experiment
is the (v = 0, L = 2) → (v′ = 1, L′ = 2) line at 9.166 nm. The details of coinci-
dences with CO2 lines and molecular reference lines, which make this transition
favorable, are explained below.

3.4 Experimental sequence

The two-photon transition matrix elements |Qv,L,v′,L′|2 of the ”favoured” hyper-
ﬁne components of two-photon transitions are of the order of 0.2 (see Fig. 3). A
typical QCL can deliver about 50 mW of single-mode optical power. Assuming a
perfect coupling to a build-up cavity of ﬁnesse 1000 with a waist of 1 mm, one ob-
tains a laser ﬂux of 15 W/mm2. Assuming an instrumental width Γf ≈10 kHz,
equation (14) yields transition rates of about 70/s. This order of magnitude
shows that long interaction times are needed and that one has to work with a
cloud of trapped ions, having a radius of the order of the beam waist.

The considerations of the previous paragraph show that vibrational two-
2 can be performed by (2 + 1′) resonance enhanced

The experiment will be conducted in the following stages:

2 ions.

3.5 Experimental setup

The ion trap is depicted in Fig. 6(a). It is a hyperbolic Paul trap with a ring of
inner radius r0 = 8.2 mm and two end caps separated by 2z0 = 6 mm. Two pairs
of holes (2 mm in diameter) are drilled in the ring along two orthogonal axes to
shine the ion cloud with the UV and IR light. Both end cap electrodes are AC
grounded. A RF voltage (about 200 V peak to peak amplitude at 10.3 MHz) and
a continuous voltage of a few Volts are applied to the ring electrode, resulting
in trapping well depths of a few eV.

The H+

2 ions are produced by electron impact ionisation from the residual
H2 gas. The electron gun is made of a tungsten wire and a Wehnelt cylinder;
it is typically turned on for 100-200 ms. A 1 mm hole in one of the end cap
electrodes allows access to the trap.

The contents of the trap are analyzed by applying a short negative high
voltage pulse to the second end cap, thus extracting the ions from the trap
through a 2 mm hole. The extracted ions are accelerated and focused onto a
multi-channel plate (MCP) detector located 7 cm away, a long enough distance
to separate by time of ﬂight the H+, H+
3 ions that are simultaneously
produced and trapped. A typical time of ﬂight spectrum is shown in Fig. 6(b).
Up to a few thousand H+
2 ions can be stored in the trap. The ion lifetime is of
a few seconds and is limited by the residual pressure in the vacuum chamber.

The undesirable H+ and H+

3 ions are eliminated using the parametric exci-
tation of their secular motion, by applying RF voltage in the MHz range on one

of the end cap electrodes during the ionisation process. A KrF excimer laser at
248 nm is used to photodissociate the v ≥ 1 states in order to produce a (L, v = 0)
ions cloud. The ions are shined by 20 mJ pulses during the ﬁlling of the trap.
The characterization of ro-vibrational populations of the resulting ion cloud is
now in progress.

Since all the bound states of H+

2 are metastable, the natural widths of the two-
photon transitions are extremely small. In Paul traps, the ion cloud temperature
is of the order of magnitude of the potential depth expressed in K, i.e. ≈ 104 K
in our trap. Under those conditions, the two-photon linewidth Γf (appearing in
Eq. (14)) is expected to be limited by the second-order Doppler eﬀect, i.e. of the
order 10 kHz. It will limit the ultimate frequency resolution of the experiment
at the 3·10−10 level, and the mass ratio resolution at the 6·10−10 level.

Ion cooling will thus be necessary in order to reach the metrological objective
of the experiment at the 10−10 level. Nevertheless, the ﬁrst step of the experiment
is the observation of a two-photon transition, which is feasible with hot ions using
a kHz linewidth laser source.

3.6 Two-photon excitation laser source

The laser system we have built is aimed at exciting the (L = 2, v = 0) →
(L′ = 2, v′ = 1) two-photon transition at 9.166 µm. In this range, two kinds
of laser sources are available. Single-mode CO2 lasers have high output power
and sub-kHz linewidths, but are hardly tunable on ranges exceeding 100 MHz,
i.e. much smaller than the 1.65 GHz gap between the closest CO2 emission line
(9R(42)) and the H+
2 line (see Fig. 7(b)). Recently, single mode quantum cas-
cade laser (QCL) became commercially available. They can be tuned over about
10 cm−1 (300 GHz) through their temperature and injection current, but have

large linewidths of the order of a few MHz. Several experiments have shown
that the linewidth can be reduced well below the kHz level by injection-current
locking the QCL to a molecular line [54] or to a high ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot cavity
resonance [55]. We have developed a laser source that takes advantage of both
the narrow linewidth of the CO2 laser and the tunability of the QCL [56].

The setup is shown in Fig. 8. A CO2 laser oscillating on the 9R(42) line is
frequency shifted by 128 MHz and stabilized on the intracavity saturated ab-
sorption signal of the (21, 3, 19) → (21, 2, 20) line of the ν6 band of formic acid
(HCOOH) (see Fig. 7(a)). The absolute frequency of that transition (32 708 263
980.5 kHz) has recently be determined with an uncertainty of 1 kHz [57] by sum
frequency mixing with a 30 THz wide visible femtosecond frequency comb [58].
The QCL is operated in a liquid nitrogen optical cryostat. The output power
is 50 mW with a 700 mA injection current and a temperature of 80K. The
QCL is phase-locked to the CO2 laser with a tunable frequency oﬀset in the
500-2000 MHz range [56]. The analysis of the beat note spectrum under locked
conditions (see Fig. 9) shows that we have realized a narrow-line tunable laser
source well suited to probe the H+
2 two-photon lines, and also the ro-vibrationnal

4 Cooling and Spectroscopy of HD+

In experiments performed at the University of D¨usseldorf, the MHIs H+
2 , D+
2 ,
and HD+ were cooled to temperatures of ≃ 10 mK in a radiofrequency trap,
by sympathetic cooling with laser-cooled beryllium ions. High-resolution spec-
troscopic studies of several rovibrational infrared transitions in HD+ were per-
formed. Hyperﬁne splitting of the lines was observed, and is in good agreement
with theoretical predictions. The transitions were detected by monitoring the de-
crease in ion number after selective photodissociation of HD+ ions in the upper
vibrational state.

4.1 Preparation and characterization of cold MHI ensembles

MHIs are just a few of a multitude of species that can be cooled to mK tempera-
tures, by sympathetic cooling [59,60] - the molecular species and a laser-coolable
atomic species, with the same sign of charge, are simultaneously stored in a ra-
diofrequency trap. Laser cooling the atoms then also eﬃciently cools the molec-
ular ions via the long-range Coulomb interaction. Temperatures below 20 mK
can be reliably reached. We have shown that using Be+ ions as coolant permits
to cool sympathetically ions from mass 1 to mass 200 amu [61–63]. A heavier
atomic coolant species can be used to extend the mass range. For example, using
138Ba+ as coolant molecular ions up to mass 410 amu have recently been cooled
[64].

We use a linear quadrupole trap to simultaneously store both Be+ and MHIs.
The radiofrequency trap is driven at 14 MHz, with a peak-to-peak amplitude
of 380 V. This results in a radial Mathieu stability parameter qr ≃ 0.13 for
HD+. The trap is enclosed in a UHV chamber kept below 10−10 mbar. The
chamber is equipped with a leak valve for the controlled introduction of gases.
An all-solid-state 313 nm laser system is used for cooling Be+ [65].

To load Be+ ions into the trap, atoms are thermally evaporated from a beryl-
lium wire, and ionised by an electron beam. The molecular loading is achieved by
leaking in neutral gas at a pressure of ∼ (1−3)·10−10 mbar, ionised by an electron
beam with an energy of 200 eV, and a current of ∼ 30 µA, for a loading time of
2 s. This produces mixed-species crystals like those shown in Figs. 10(a,b). The
ions with a higher charge-to-mass ratio (in this case the molecular ions) expe-
rience a stronger trap pseudopotential, and thus form a dark (non-ﬂuorescing)
core to the crystal. The asymmetric distribution of species along the z-axis ob-
served in Fig. 10(b) is caused by the light pressure of the cooling laser on the
beryllium ions.

The observed crystals are reproduced by molecular dynamics (MD) simula-
tions [61,66]. Visual matching of overall structure, structural details and blur-
rings of CCD and simulated images allows ﬁtting the ion numbers and tem-
peratures of the diﬀerent species. The number of ions of diﬀerent species given

images of this crystal at (c) 20 mK, (d) 12 mK, (e) 8 mK and (f) 6 mK. In the simu-
lations, the beryllium ions are shown in red and the HD+ ions in blue. Laser cooling

in Fig. 10(b) were found in this way. In the simulations we assume an ideal
linear trap, use the quasipotential approximation and model heating eﬀects by
stochastic forces on the ions. The obtained temperatures are thus eﬀective secu-
lar temperatures. Fig. 10 shows a determination of the temperature; agreement
is found for a Be+ temperature of appox. 10 mK. This sets an upper limit, as our
experimental images are also limited in sharpness by our detection optics, CCD
resolution, and sensor noise, which are not considered. The temperature varies
depending on crystal size and cooling parameters, and is typically in the range
5 mK to 15 mK, with smaller crystals generally colder. These temperatures are
consistent with measurements of the ﬂuorescence lineshape of the Be+ ions.

For all species of molecular ions studied here, our MD simulations show that
the sympathetically cooled molecular ion ensemble is also crystalline, i.e. its
time-averaged ion distribution is strongly inhomogeneous, and that it is strongly
thermally coupled to the Be+ ions. Assuming similar heating eﬀects for the
molecular ions and the Be+ ions, the simulations show that the moleculars ions
have a temperature similar to that of Be+, due to the strong Coulomb coupling.
The trapped species are identiﬁed and the time evolution of their numbers is
monitored by excitation of their mass-dependent radial (secular) modes, using
a spatially homogenous and temporally oscillating electric ﬁeld. For HD+ ions
the measured secular frequency was ≈770 kHz, signiﬁcantly shifted from the
calculated single-particle frequency, due to Coulomb coupling between diﬀerent
species in the trap [67]. Excitation amplitude, sweep rate, and covered frequency

range were chosen so that the ion crystal had suﬃcient time to cool back to its
initial temperature between individual excitation cycles. The excitation heats
both the molecular ions and the atomic coolants, which changes the scattering
rate of 313 nm cooling light by the Be+ ions. The HD+ secular resonance becomes
visible in the Be+ ﬂuorescence, and its strength is proportional to the amount
of HD+ ions in the ion crystal.

4.2 Spectroscopy of HD+

The choice of HD+ for spectroscopic studies was made because of the availabil-
ity of dipole-allowed ro-vibrational transitions which simplify the spectroscopic
techniques. Nevertheless, vibrational spectroscopy in the electronic ground state
in near-absence of collisions, as is the case for the present molecular ions en-
sembles, is faced with the diﬃculty that molecules excited to a vibrational level
decay only slowly, implying very low ﬂuorescence rates. As the ﬂuorescence wave-
lengths are in the mid to far infrared, photon counting would require a sophisti-
cated detection system. We circumvent this diﬃculty by applying the technique
of (1+1′) resonance enhanced multiphoton dissociation (REMPD): the molecules
are excited by an infrared (IR) laser and then selectively photodissociated from
the upper vibrational state by a second, ﬁxed-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) laser
(Fig.11). The remaining number of molecular ions is the quantity measured as a
function of the frequency of the IR laser. As the molecular sample is small (typ.
40-100 ions) the spectroscopy requires the spectra to be obtained by repeated
molecular ion production and interrogation cycles. The lasers employed are a
single-frequency, widely tunable diode laser at 1.4 µm (Agilent 81480A), and a
resonantly frequency-doubled Yb:YAG laser at 266 nm. The IR laser linewidth

absorption spectroscopy in a water vapor cell.

Due to the weak coupling between external and internal (rotational) degrees
of freedom, the internal temperature of the HD+ ions is close to room tem-
perature, in thermal equilibrium with the vacuum chamber [70,10]. There is
signiﬁcant (> 5%) population for rotational levels up to L = 6. Indeed, we have
observed 12 transitions between 1391 nm and 1471 nm, from lower rotational
levels L = 0 to L = 6.

The loss of HD+ ions not only depends on the REMPD process, but also on
transitions induced by blackbody radiation (BBR). We modeled the loss of HD+
by solving the rate equations for the populations of all (v, L) levels interacting
with the IR and UV lasers, as well as with the BBR radiation at 300 K. The
theoretically obtained excitation spectrum (see Fig. 13 and text below) of the
levels probed by the IR laser is included, but for the remainder of the calculation
hyperﬁne structure, due to electron, nuclear and rotational spins, is ignored.
The rovibrational transition moments involved are taken from [71]. The rate of
dissociation by UV light is obtained using cross sections from [68]. For typical UV
intensities, dissociation rates of 102–103 s−1 are found. The rate equation model
reveals two diﬀerent timescales at which the HD+ number declines during a
typical experiment. A ﬁrst, fast (< 1 s) decay occurs when the IR laser selectively
promotes HD+ ions from a speciﬁc (v = 0, L) level to a rotational level in v′ = 4,
from which they are eﬃciently photodissociated. This process rapidly dissociates
those (v = 0, L) HD+ ions which are in the hyperﬁne states probed by the IR
laser. The remaining molecular ions (a signiﬁcant fraction of the total initial

number) are dissociated signiﬁcantly slower, essentially at the rate at which
the hyperﬁne levels of (v = 0, L) are repopulated by BBR and spontaneous
emission. For example, for the (v = 0, L = 2) → (v′ = 4, L′ = 1) transition,
and for typical intensities of 6 W/cm2 for the IR and 10 W/cm2 for the UV
laser, the fast HD+ decay takes place at a rate ∼10 s−1 (which is not resolved
experimentally), whereas the decay due to BBR–induced repopulation occurs at
a rate of ∼0.04 s−1. The latter rate is fairly consistent with the measured decay
depicted in Fig.12(b), but observed decay rates depend strongly on which part
of the hyperﬁne spectrum is interrogated. This points at a shortcoming of the
simple rate equation model used here, and our observations can probably be
explained precisely only by a rate equation model which takes the full hyperﬁne
structure of all involved (v, L) levels into account.

As an example, Fig. 12(b) shows the time evolution of the HD+ secular
excitation resonance while the HD+ ions are excited on the maximum of the
rovibrational line (v = 0, L = 2) → (v′ = 4, L′ = 1) at 1430.3883 nm. The de-
crease of the HD+ resonance in the secular excitation spectrum, induced by the
REMPD process, is accompanied by a decrease of the dark crystal core con-
taining the MHIs. The secular excitation spectrum also shows an increase of the
number of D+ ions, which result from the dissociation of excited HD+ ions. These
ions are sympathetically cooled and remain in the crystal core. Fig. 12(c) shows
the mixed-species ion crystal after all HD+ was dissociated. The dark crystal
core has shrunk signiﬁcantly, and the crystal now contains ≈1100 Be+ and ≈50
D+ ions. Assuming equal probability for photodissociation to D+ and H+, this
number indicates that most generated D+ ions are sympathetically cooled and
trapped. Loss rates are obtained by exponential ﬁtting to the maxima of the
HD+ resonances in the secular excitation spectrum (solid line in Fig. 12(b)). In
this way, a 0.01 s−1 background loss rate of HD+ ions from the trap is obtained
when both the IR and UV lasers are turned oﬀ. This loss is due to chemical re-
actions between HD+ ions and background gases. The observed background loss
rate is ﬁtted well by a single exponential decay, which rules out strong nonlinear
dependence of the Be+ ﬂuorescence during secular excitation on the number of
HD+ ions.

The spectroscopic signal used to produce the spectra in Fig. 13 is the molec-
ular ion dissociation probability, obtained as the relative change of the heights of
the HD+ secular resonances in the Be+ ﬂuorescence before and after the REMPD
excitation (Fig. 12(d)). For each transition, the HD+ dissociation probability was
measured as a function of the frequency of the IR laser, in steps of 15 MHz. Each
data point was obtained by averaging over several individual measurements of
the HD+ dissociation probability occurring over ∼5 s. Each data point requires
a new loading of HD+ ions in the Be+ crystal. For all measurements, comparable
HD+ ion numbers were used, as deduced from the size of the crystal core after
loading. However, during each HD+ loading cycle a small fraction of the Be+ is
lost from the trap, due to chemical reactions with neutral HD gas [63]. The same
Be+ ion crystal can be used for up to 40 HD+ loadings, suﬃcient for obtaining
the spectra in Fig. 13. A typical spectrum is taken within 1-2 hours.

at 1394 nm. The curves are ﬁts to the data (•), where the theoretical stick spectra
were broadened by ≈40 MHz. The theoretical spectrum exhibits a large number of
very weak transitions, due to weak mixing of pure coupled angular momentum states.
The ordinate values are the molecular ion dissociation probability for a 5 s irradiation
of 0.65 W/cm2 IR and 10 W/cm2 UV light. The insets show typical error bars [69].

Detailed measurements for two transitions (v = 0, L = 2) → (v′ = 4, L′ = 1, 3)
are shown in Figs. 13(a,b). Both spectra reveal a partly resolved hyperﬁne struc-
ture, which can be compared with the prediction from an eﬀective spin Hamil-
tonian, written as Heﬀ = b1Ip · S + c1IpzSz + b2Id · S + c2IdzSz + γS · J [72,73].
Here, Ip, Id, and S denote the spin of the proton, deuteron, and electron, re-
spectively; the subscript z indicates the projection on the internuclear axis. The
hyperﬁne coeﬃcients b1, b2, c1, c2, and γ have been recently calculated to high
accuracy [43], see Sec. 2.4. The hyperﬁne level energies and eigenfunctions are
found by diagonalization of the matrix representation of Heﬀ in a suitable an-
gular momentum coupling scheme. Terms arising from the nuclear spin-rotation
and deuteron quadrupole interactions are neglected as they contribute ≪1 MHz
to the hyperﬁne level energies [43]. The results of the diagonalization were sub-
sequently used to calculate line strengths (Eq. 11) of the individual hyperﬁne
components within a given rovibrational transition, leading to ”stick spectra”,
as shown in Fig. 13. Inhomogeneous broadening of the spectra may be accounted
for by convolving each line with a Gaussian lineshape of a given width.

The broadened stick spectra are ﬁtted to the experimental spectra using the
linewidth, the vertical scale and the frequency oﬀset as ﬁt parameters
(Fig. 13). The frequency oﬀset corresponds to the deperturbed ro-vibrational
transition frequency, which is thus determined to within the accuracy of the
wavelength calibration of the IR laser (40 MHz) and the ﬁt uncertainty (3 MHz).
The measured deperturbed ro-vibrational transition frequency is in good agree-
ment with the ab initio results from [21], see Fig. 13. The partly resolved hyper-
ﬁne structure in the measured spectra agrees well with the theoretical results
obtained from [72,43]. We ﬁnd both theoretically and experimentally that the
hyperﬁne structure for other transitions in the P and R branches is similar to
that in Figs. 13(a,b).

We observe a typical line broadening of 40 MHz, which corresponds to kB ×
(0.2 K) of energy in the axial motion. The kinetic energy in the secular motion
(as inferred from molecular dynamics simulations) of the HD+ ions can give
rise to broadening of about 10 MHz only [61]. Saturation broadening also does
not play a signiﬁcant role, as conﬁrmed by comparing spectra taken at diﬀerent
IR and UV intensities. Using the polarization-dependent 313 nm ﬂuorescence
of the Be+ ions as a magnetic ﬁeld probe, the magnetic ﬁeld (which is along
the direction of propagation of the 313 nm laser beam) has been adjusted and
veriﬁed to be 50 mT and to vary by no more than 40 mT over the extent of
the crystal, which implies Zeeman broadening <1 MHz. This leaves Doppler
broadening due to micromotion as the most probable cause for the observed line
broadening. This micromotion could arise from phase shifts in the rf potentials
applied to the various electrodes, and from coupling between axial (IR laser
beam direction) and radial ion motion. For our trap, in which the HD+ ions are
located at least 10 µm away from the trap axis, the (radial) micromotion energy
exceeds kB(0.5 K).

The results described are of signiﬁcance in several respects. They demon-
strate, for the ﬁrst time, the possibility of high-resolution spectroscopy of small,
trapped molecular ion samples, sympathetically cooled well into the millikelvin
range. We have achieved a spectral resolution 10 times higher than with any
previous cold molecular ion method, and the same enhancement was obtained
for the excitation rate. The observed population dynamics demonstrated the
weakness of collisions. The methods used for trapping, cooling and detection are
quite general, and are applicable to a host of other molecular ion species. This
includes other ions of astrophysical and cosmological interest such as H+
3 and its
isotopomers, which have been trapped in our setup [61,62]. Also, the spectral res-
olution achieved here may be further improved: for instance, ﬁrst-order Doppler
broadening may be circumvented by use of a tightly conﬁning trap which holds
the ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime, or by two-photon spectroscopy. Furthermore,
the presence of the atomic coolant ions oﬀers an in situ tool to detect possible
perturbing ﬁelds.

5 Conclusion and Outlook

In summary, the development of high-accuracy laser spectroscopy of trapped
MHIs has made signiﬁcant progress. On the theory side, the energies have been
calculated with a relative accuracy of the order of 1 ppb. Detailed predictions of
the line strengths of one- and two-photon transitions have been given, which are
important guides for the experiments. Certain systematic shifts (dc and ac Stark
shifts [15,22]) have also been calculated, but are not described here. On the ex-
perimental side, several important techniques have been demonstrated: cooling
of MHIs to tens of mK, vibrational-state selective photodissociation, one-photon
vibrational spectroscopy with spectral resolution at the level of 2·10−7, rotational
population measurement, in-situ ion detection, tunable, high-power, continuous-
wave narrow-linewidth laser for two-photon spectroscopy. Based on the present

24

results, it is expected that the two-photon H+
2 spectroscopy experiment will ulti-
mately allow a spectral resolution at the level of 3 · 10−10, while the one-photon
1.4 µm HD+ spectroscopy in the current apparatus will be limited by Doppler
broadening to several parts in 108. One-photon spectroscopy of HD+ vibrational
transitions having longer wavelength or the use of a trap with stronger con-
ﬁnement should allow reaching the Lamb-Dicke regime, with a strong increase
in spectral resolution. As described above, two-photon spectroscopy is another
alternative.

For both ion species, the investigation of systematic shifts will become an
important task. It is expected that Zeeman shifts and Stark shifts can be reduced
or measured to a level below one part in 1010 in a cold ion ensemble. This
should enable comparisons of experimental and theoretical transition frequencies
at levels below 1 ppb, and, in the longer term, the development of a novel
approach to the measurement of mass ratios of electron and hydrogen isotopes.
In the future, it may become attractive to use the method of quantum-logic-
enabled spectroscopy [74,75]. Some of the experimental limitations (broad state
population distribution, need for destructive detection of molecular excitation,
systematic eﬀects) encountered with the approaches described here could be
substantially alleviated.

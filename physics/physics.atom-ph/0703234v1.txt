When molecules interact with intense light sources of femtosecond or shorter duration the rota-
tional degrees of freedom are frozen during the response to the strong nonperturbative interaction.
We show how the frozen degrees of freedom aﬀect the measurable signals in high-harmonic gener-
ation and above threshold ionization. High-harmonic generation exhibits optical coherence in the
signal from diﬀerent orientations of the molecule. For ionization, the contributions from diﬀer-
ent orientations are added incoherently. The eﬀects are demonstrated for realistic alignment and
orientation schemes.

Currently, intense few-cycle pulses of femtosecond du-
ration are produced in several laser laboratories world-
It is of fundamental interest to investigate how
wide.
such pulses interact with quantum systems. Gas phase
atoms and molecules are ideal test systems for these
studies. As this research ﬁeld is maturing,
interest-
ing applications are evolving: tomographic reconstruc-
tion [1], laser-induced electron diﬀraction [2] and molec-
ular clocks [3, 4, 5, 6] being examples under current study.

Molecules are particularly well-suited for such stud-
ies since they inherently carry the time scales that
match those of the new laser sources: nuclei move on
the femtosecond timescale, electrons on the attosecond
timescale. Hence, the new ultrashort sources are perfect
for looking inside molecules and for gaining insight into
nuclear and electronic dynamics. Conversely, if the dy-
namics of the system under study is well-understood, in-
formation about the characteristics of the few-cycle pulse
can be obtained. For instance, in atoms, where an ac-
curate description of the electrons can be obtained, the
carrier-envelope phase diﬀerence may be extracted in this
way [7, 8, 9]. For molecules, the extra nuclear degrees of
freedom may be used to control the process of interest.
As an example, the ability to orient molecules [10] with
respect to an external axis may be used to enhance the
high-harmonic yield [11, 12, 13, 14]. Solving the dy-
namics of the molecule in the strong ﬁeld is, however,
much more diﬃcult than the atom due to the extra de-
grees of freedom.
In fact, not even the simplest case
of H+
2 interacting with strong IR ﬁelds has been solved
in full 6-dimensional time dependent calculations. For-
tunately, the interesting prospect of ever shorter pulse
durations introduces a simpliﬁcation in the description:
the timescales of rotation and vibration are often much
longer than the actual applied pulses themselves, and
therefore some of these degrees of freedom may be treated
as frozen during the interaction with the ﬁeld.
In the
present work, we describe how frozen degrees of freedom
aﬀect the outcome of an experiment in a non-trivial man-

ner. We show that the inﬂuence of the dynamics and the
formulation of the theory of measurement depend very
much on the process considered: we obtain completely
diﬀerent behavior for above threshold ionization (ATI)
and high-harmonic generation (HHG) with respect to the
coherence in the signal from rotational degrees of free-
dom. The discussion is exempliﬁed using realistic align-
ment and orientation schemes.

We consider HHG and ATI in molecules interacting
with an ultrashort strong laser pulse.
In these experi-
ments, there are many molecules in the laser focus, but
the phase space density is low and we can use the single-
particle density operator ˆρ(t0) for calculations. At time
t = t0 prior to any probe or pump pulse, the molecule
is in a time-independent thermal state at temperature
T . By deﬁnition, ˆρ(t0) = exp (− ˆH/kBT )/Z, with parti-
tion function Z = Tr[exp(− ˆH/kBT )], ˆH the ﬁeld-free
molecular Hamiltonian and kB Boltzmann’s constant.
The initial state is resolved on energy eigenstates |αi
with energy Eα. We concentrate on diatomics where,
prior to the applied pulses, only the electric and vibra-
tional ground states are populated. Consequently, the
energy eigenstate is characterized by the angular mo-
mentum quantum number, J, and its projection on a
space ﬁxed axis, M , i.e., α = (J, M ). The discussion is
straightforwardly generalized to more complicated cases
and the conclusions remain unaﬀected. There is no decay
on the timescales we are considering so propagation is de-
scribed by a unitary operator ˆU (t): ˆU(t)|αi = |Ψα(t)i;
ˆρ(t) = ˆU (t)ˆρ(t0) ˆU †(t) =
α Pα|Ψα(t)ihΨα(t)|, with the
Boltzmann weight Pα = exp (−Eα/kBT )/Z. The evolu-
tion due to ˆU (t) can contain both alignment pulses and
a subsequent ultrashort probe pulse producing ATI and
HHG.

We separate out the relatively slow rotational move-
to obtain ΨJM (re, R, Ω, t) ≈
ment of
ψ(re, R, t; Ω) φJM (Ω, t), with R the internuclear distance
and Ω = (θ, φ) the spherical polar solid angle composed
of the usual polar and azimuthal angles. The variables

that enter only parametrically in the wave function are
put after the semicolon. If we consider the response to a
femtosecond probe pulse, the rotational degrees of free-
dom can be considered frozen during the probe pulse cen-
tered at tp, i.e., the full wave function is approximated
by

ΨJM (re, R, Ω, t) ≈ ψ(re, R, t; Ω, tp) φJM (Ω, tp).

(1)

In the case of a prealigning or orienting pump pulse be-
tween t0 and tp, φJM (Ω, tp) is the rotational wave packet
evolving from YJM (Ω) at time t0. If no pump pulse is
used then φJM (Ω, tp) = YJM (Ω).

Treating HHG ﬁrst, the complex amplitude for the
emission of harmonics polarized along the unit vector e
with frequency ω, is obtained from the Fourier transform

We note that one can observe interferences in the inten-
sity S(ω) from incoherent members of the ensemble, i.e.,
members belonging to diﬀerent α. This eﬀect of inten-
sity interferences stemming from adding electric ﬁelds is
known as “polarization beats” to distinguish it from co-
herent quantum beats [17].

arises from the coherent summation of amplitude contri-
butions from diﬀerent orientations, Ae,vib
(ω, Ω, tp), inde-
pendent on the temperature of the sample. In general,
the signals always contain optical coherences, except in
the trivial case G(Ω, tp) = δ(Ω − Ω′). Apart from be-
ing physically well-justiﬁed and displaying the eﬀects of
the frozen molecular degrees of freedom, the relevance of
(6) is that the numerical propagation during the ultra-
short pulse is immensely more manageable when the di-
mensionality is reduced. For molecules with vibrational
frequencies much smaller than the inverse duration of
the applied laser pulse, the vibrational coordinates can
also be treated as ﬁxed, and one can separate out the
vibrational part of the vibronic wave function in (6) as
well. For CO with frozen rotations, Fig. 1 shows the
results of simulations of the emitted high-harmonics of
the same polarization as the linearly polarized driving
800 nm probe ﬁeld with peak intensity 2 × 1014 W/cm2.
The model used to calculate the harmonic signal resem-
bles the Lewenstein model. Further details are given
in [18]. Panel (a) shows three cases corresponding to
(i) uniform orientational distribution, (ii) perfect parallel
orientation, i.e., the permanent molecular dipoles (each
pointing from the O to the less electronegative C) are all
directed along the polarization vector of the probe pulse
and (iii) perfect perpendicular orientation. The panel
clearly shows that the HHG signals depend critically on
the direction of the orientation. We ﬁrst discuss cases
(ii) and (iii) and return to the unaligned case in the end
of this section. There is no dependence of the azimuthal
angle in any of the cases, and so we only consider the po-
lar part of the solid angle. The occurrence and absence

of even harmonics in the signal in (ii) and (iii), respec-
tively, may be understood by recalling that emission of
harmonic of order N comprises N+1 dipole transitions
(N absorptions of a laser photon, and the emission of one
high-harmonic photon).
In case (ii), only the compo-
nent ˆk of the dipole operator parallel to the internuclear
axis is present and this component has a ∆Λ = 0 selec-
tion rule, with Λ the absolute value of the projection of
the electronic orbital angular momentum on the internu-
clear axis. Initially the molecule is in its Σ ground state
and because of ∆Λ = 0 it stays in the manifold of Σ
states. The Σ state, from which the ﬁnal recombination
step occurs, is hence accessible by the absorption of both
an even and odd number of photons and, consequently,
both even or odd harmonics are produced. Turning to
case (iii), only the component ˆ⊥ of the dipole operator
perpendicular to the internuclear axis is present and this
component has a ∆Λ = ±1 selection rule. Consequently,
only odd harmonics are observed since the Π state, from
which the recombination occurs, can only be reached by
the absorption of an odd number of photons. In the un-
aligned case (i), the situation is analyzed by considering
i=1 (ˆki cos θ + ˆ⊥i sin θ)
the transition operator ˆON = ΠN +1
corresponding to emission of a harmonic of order N for a
molecule with the permanent dipole oriented at an angle
θ with respect to the polarization vector of the probe laser
ﬁeld. In the limits of parallel (θ = 0◦) and perpendicular
(θ = 90◦) orientation we retrieve the results discussed
In general the operator ˆON contains even and
above.
odd powers of cosines and sines. In the unaligned case
G(180◦ − θ, tp) = G(θ, tp), and we see from Eq. (6) that
only combinations of the cosines and sines yielding an
even function on [0, π] will survive, i.e., the terms con-
taining an even number of the ˆki operator. From the
selection rules it is, however, clear that the total num-
ber of Λ changing transition must be an even number
and thus the total number of dipole transitions is even,
explaining why only odd harmonics are emitted in the
unaligned case.

In order to simulate a more realistic orientational dis-
tribution, we present in (b) the prediction of the har-
monic signal from an ensemble of partially oriented CO
molecules. To obtain orientation, a half cycle pulse
(HCP) with amplitude 870 kV/cm and a duration of 0.5
ps (FWHM) is followed 4.14 ps later by a linearly polar-
ized laser pulse of 0.5 ps duration and a peak intensity
of 5 × 1012 W/cm2. In order to model the orientation we
solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the
rotational degrees of freedom subject to the rotational
constant B = 57.9 GHz, dipole moment µ = 0.112 D,
and polarizability volume components αk = 1.925 ˚A3
and α⊥ = 1.420 ˚A3 [19]. The initial rotational tem-
perature is 5 K. The probe ﬁeld which generates high-
harmonics is as in panel (a). We plot the harmonic sig-
nal at two diﬀerent delays with respect to the peak of

3

the HCP. The time delay tp = 5 ps is chosen to illus-
trate the case with an almost symmetric orientational
distribution: G(180◦ − θ, 5 ps) ≃ G(θ, 5 ps), and in this
case the even harmonics are suppressed as expected from
arguments similar to the ones used in the discussion of
the unaligned case in panel (a). At longer delays the
molecules have time to orient obtaining a maximum after
8.1 ps with hcos θi = −0.11. At this time delay the CO
dipoles tend to be pointing opposite to the polarization
vector of the HCP, and this asymmetric distribution al-
lows for even and odd harmonics of comparable strength.
We now turn to a discussion of ATI. The funda-
mental quantity is the probability W (k) for measur-
ing the momentum k of the outgoing electron. The
associated measurement projection operator is ˆPk =
k | ⊗ ˆIR which projects on an electron scattering

the transition for frozen rotations at time tp. The time t
may be any time after the ionizing pulse. In contrast to
the HHG signal (6) which is optically coherent in nuclear
orientations, the signal for ATI is obtained as an inco-
herent summation of contributions from diﬀerent molec-
ular orientations. As was the case for the HHG pro-
cess, the calculations involved in the evaluation of (7)
are vastly simpliﬁed if the rotational and/or the vibra-
tional degrees of motion are frozen during the femtosec-
ond pulse. Figure 2 shows angular distributions of the
outgoing electron for N2 and O2 for isotropic and ﬁeld-
free aligned samples. We obtain the angular distributions
by integrating (7) over the magnitude of the momentum.
In the present calculation, we approximate the transition
amplitude in (7) by the molecular strong-ﬁeld approxima-
tion amplitude [20]. The degrees of alignment are deter-
mined by the procedure described in [21], and we use the
following parallel (perpendicular) polarizability volume
of N2: 2.38 ˚A3 (1.45 ˚A3) and of O2: 2.3 ˚A3 (1.1 ˚A3).
The linearly polarized aligning pulse has peak intensity
4 × 1013 W/cm2 and duration 59 fs (FWHM). The initial
rotational temperature is 11 K. For the relatively low ini-
tial rotational temperature assumed here, the maximum
alignment occurs at the quarter revival period (2.1 ps af-
ter the pump pulse for N2 and 2.9 ps delay for O2). The
corresponding values of hcos2 θi are 0.71 (N2) and 0.74
(O2). We present results both for alignment preferen-
tially along the polarization axis of the probe laser and

for alignment along an axis perpendicular to the probe
polarization. For N2, the only eﬀect of making G(Ω, tp)
anisotropic is a change in the overall scaling. This is due
to the Σg symmetry of the initial orbital and is in ac-
cordance with the predictions of tunneling theory which
favors electron-ejection along the polarization direction
[22]. In the case of O2, we ﬁnd a more pronounced ef-
fect of the orientation. The change in angular pattern
reﬂects the symmetry of the initial Πg orbital which has
zero amplitude along and perpendicular to the molecu-
lar axis: this nodal structure forbids the electron escap-
ing along the vertical polarization axis when perfectly
aligned, hence the change from (d) to (e) and (f).

In conclusion, we have developed the theory of how to
deal with frozen nuclear degrees of freedom in HHG and
ATI. The frozen coordinates aﬀect the motion in a non-
trivial way and coherence issues depend on the degree of
orientation. Physically, the phase coherence in HHG with
respect to diﬀerent orientations may be understood by
the superposition principle for the electric ﬁeld generated
by an ensemble of oscillators with diﬀerent orientations.
The incoherence in the ATI signal follows from the fact
that we in principle, by looking at the nuclear motion
after the pulse, may infer the orientation of the molecule
at the instant of ionization. The present work form the
theoretical basis for future work on molecules interacting
with strong few-cycle pulses.

Precision Spectroscopy
at Heavy Ion Ring Accelerator SIS300

Abstract. Unique spectroscopic possibilities open up if a laser beam interacts with
relativistic lithium-like ions stored in the heavy ion ring accelerator SIS300 at the
future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research FAIR in Darmstadt, Germany. At
a relativistic factor γ = 36 the 2P1/2 level can be excited from the 2S1/2 ground
state for any element with frequency doubled dye-lasers in collinear geometry. Pre-
cise transition energy measurements can be performed if the ﬂuorescence photons,
boosted in forward direction into the X-ray region, are energetically analyzed with
a single crystal monochromator. The hyperﬁne structure can be investigated at the
2P1/2 − 2S1/2 transition for all elements and at the 2P3/2 − 2S1/2 transition for
elements with Z ≤ 50. Isotope shifts and nuclear moments can be measured with
unprecedented precision, in principle even for only a few stored radioactive species
with known nuclear spin. A superior relative line width in the order of 5 · 10−7 may
be feasible after laser cooling, and even polarized external beams may be prepared
by optical pumping.

1. Introduction

The central part of the planned FAIR project in Darmstadt is a heavy
ion synchrotron called SIS300 with a magnetic rigidity Bρ = 300 Tm
and a circumference of 1100 m [Gutbrod et al. 2006]1. The magnetic
ﬁeld will be produced by superconducting magnets with a maximum
induction of 6 Tesla which can be ramped with a rate of 1 T/s. With this
synchrotron bare uranium can be accelerated up to a maximum energy
β2 =
of 34 GeV/u, corresponding to a relativistic factor γ = 1/
37.5 and a reduced velocity β = v/c = 0.9996444, with c the speed of
light. A fascinating possibility of this accelerator is the excitation of few
electron systems by the interaction with the light of conventional lasers

in a collinear geometry. If the laser beam counter-propagates lithium-
like uranium with γ = 36, the laser light at the blue edge of the visible
spectral range with an energy of ~ωL = 3.898 eV is Doppler-shifted
and appears in the rest frame of the Li-like system with an energy of
~ω0 ∼= 2γ~ωL = 280.6 eV. As will be outlined in more detail in section 2
2S1/2 transition energy in lithium-like uranium.
this is just the 2P1/2 −
A variety of spectroscopic possibilities exist if this transition can be
induced. As will be pointed out in section 3 the combination with a
precise single crystal X-ray spectrometer, which detects the ﬂuorescence
photons boosted in forward direction up to an energy of ~ωX = 2γ~ω0
= 20.2 keV allows both, very accurate measurements of the transition
energy ~ω0 and the relativistic factor γ. If radioactive Li-like ions could
be injected into the SIS300, a hyperﬁne spectroscopy would be possible
for radioactive species with nuclear spin I > 0, see section 4. A few
remarks on laser cooling will be made in section 5. In section 6 the
possibility of a nuclear polarization by optical pumping with circularly
polarized laser light will brieﬂy be touched on. The paper closes in
section 7 with a conclusion.

The essential ideas of this paper were for the ﬁrst time presented by
the author of this paper in the year 2000 at GSI in Darmstadt [Backe
2000], see also Gutbrod et al. 2001.

2S1/2 transitions in lithium-like uranium

2. The 2P1/2,3/2 −
The three electron, lithium-like level scheme of uranium is shown in
ﬁgure 1. The third electron outside the closed 1s2 shell is a 2s electron,
consequently the ground state is a 2S1/2 term. The lowest excited
states belong to the 1s22p conﬁguration and form 2P1/2 and 2P3/2
terms. The large ﬁne-structure splitting of about 4.3 keV originates
from relativistic eﬀects.

A ﬁrst precision measurement of the 2P1/2 −

2S1/2 transition energy
of (280.59
0.09) eV was reported by Schweppe et al. 1991. The aim
of this experiment was to test QED in few electron uranium. In a
number of publications Lindgren et al., and Persson et al. calculated
(280.52
0.28) eV which was in good agreement with the experiment.
In the meantime better experiments by Brandau et al., who measured
0.099) eV, and by Beiersdorfer et al. were performed. In
(280.516
the latter reference a value of (280.645
0.015) eV is reported which
was obtained with SuperEBIT. The accuracy of previous experiments
was improved by nearly one order of magnitude. The best calculation
of Yerokhin et al. 2001 without second order QED eﬀects is (280.48
0.11) eV, and with inclusion of an estimated value of these eﬀects

ment exceeds currently the precision of the calculation by a factor of 14.
Despite this situation a scheme is presented in the next section with
which in future the experimental precision probably can be further
improved by another factor of 4. Alternatively, it may be useful to
measure β and γ of the Li-like ions with accuracies in the order of 10−8
and 10−5, respectively, see subsection 3.6.

3. Precision transition energy measurement
in Li-like uranium at SIS300

3.1. Proposed experimental setup

The proposed experimental setup is schematically shown in ﬁgure 2.
A laser beam with a photon energy of 5.465 eV, corresponding to a
vacuum wavelength λ = 226.87 nm, counter-propagates in a straight
section of SIS300 a Li-like uranium beam with a relativistic factor γ =
25.68. The photon energy in the rest frame of the Li-like U89+-ion is

Figure 2. Proposed schematic experimental setup. The laser beam with photons
of energy ~ωL is reﬂected by a thin mirror into a straight section of SIS300 and
interacts in a collinear geometry with lithium-like uranium ions moving in opposite
direction. De-excitation photons from the 2P1/2 − 2S1/2 transition with an energy
~ω0 = 280.6 eV appear predominantly in forward direction with respect to the HI
beam at an X-ray energy ~ωX = 14.41 keV. The photon energy is measured by a
single crystal monochromator.

Occurrence of X-rays indicates resonance absorption of laser photons
in the Li-like system. However, for an accurate measurement of the
transition energy ~ω0 also the reduced velocity β or the relativistic
factor γ must be known with high precision. This can be achieved by
an energy measurement of the X-ray photons with the aid of a single
crystal monochromator. In this manner, two very precise experimental
methods are combined. The laser photon energy can be determined
10−7 and the X-ray energy with
easily with a relative accuracy of 5

In reality the photons are emitted in the rest frame of the Li-like ion
with an angular distribution which will be assumed to be isotropic, i.e.

is given by

Here Θ0 and Θ are the observation angles with respect to the velocity
vector v of an individual Li-like ion in the rest frame of the Li-like ion
and the laboratory frame, respectively. Further on, dt0/dt = 1/γ is the
relativistic time dilatation3. The transition energy in the rest frame of
the Li-like system is

~ω0 = γ(1 + β cos Ψ)~ωL

(10)

with Ψ the angle which an individual ion with the velocity vector v
makes with the laser beam axis. In the small angle approximation, with
−→θ the observation angle with respect to the nominal velocity vector v0
of the Li-like ion beam and −→ψ the angular deviation of an individual

2 It should be mentioned that the precision of the X-ray energy measurement
and also the current value of the 2P1/2 − 2S1/2 transition energy ~ω0 is not high
enough for an improved test of the time dilatation in special relativity. Such a test
is based on equation (3) which can be rewritten with a small additional term as
~ωL · ~ωX /~ω2
0 = 1 + 2 ˆα(β2 + ...). The upper limit of the parameter ˆα is currently
−7, see Saathoﬀ et al. 2003. An improvement of this value would require
ˆα < 2.2 · 10
a measurement of ~ωL, ~ωX , and ~ω0 with at least an accuracy of 10−7.

3.3. The laser system and fluorescence rate estimate

Laser light with a wavelength of λ = 226.9 nm can be produced by an
Excimer laser running on XeF (351/353 nm) which pumps a dye laser,
for example. The output of the latter must be frequency doubled by a
BBO crystal. Assuming a mean output power of the Excimer laser P =
250 W at a repetition rate frep = 10 kHz and a pulse width of ∆tpulse =
10 ns, the instantaneous pulse power output of the frequency doubled
laser may amount to 50 kW. A bandwidth of the dye laser radiation
1 GHz can be reached by means of an intracavity etalon which

the saturation limit, since the experimental conditions are close to
saturation. The number of emitted photons per laser pulse and per

from equation (10) for ∆~ω0 = 0, it is given by the overlap of the

relative laser bandwidth ∆νL/νL = 5.3
spread ∆γb/γ = 10−4 of the Li-like ions in a bunch. A reduction due
to the angular spread σ′
HI of the Li-like beam can be neglected as
long as σ′
∆νL/νL = 1.46 mrad holds. This latter relation
can also be derived from the Doppler-shift formula (10) for which a
ﬁrst order expansion in ~ωL and a second order expansion in Ψ results
∆νL/νL for ∆~ω0 = 0. In addition are
in ∆Ψ = 2
frep = 104/s the laser repetition rate, which must be synchronized with
a circulating bunch, NLi = 105 the number of Li-like ions in a bunch,

N0,sat = 3.7, and ∆Ω0/4π = 2.67
takes into account the photon detection eﬃciency of the pn CCD as well
as photon absorption in the window of the SIS300 vacuum chamber and
the mirror for the laser light. The result for the count rate according
to equation (23) is

˙NX = 104/s which looks quite reasonable.

The precision of the X-ray energy measurement has two contributions.
One is a sort of statistical error which is assumed to be 30 % of the half

error which originates from the energy calibration. Let us assume that
the calibration is performed with the 14.41302(32) keV line of a 57Co
(t1/2 = 271 d) source which for this purpose must be placed temporarily
in the interaction region of laser and Li-like ion beam. The relative
precision δ~ω14.4/~ω14.4 = 2.2
10−5 is of the same order of magnitude
as the X-ray energy measurement. Since the error of the laser frequency
measurement can be neglected, the total expected relative error of the

Figure 5. Scheme of the experimental setup for a measurement of the hyperﬁne
structure (left), and pumping scheme (right). Shown are the Zeeman levels of the
ground and excited state with F = I ± 1/2 the total angular momentum quantum
numbers, and I the nuclear spin. While induced laser transitions can populate at
resonance only one excited hyperﬁne level, radiative (downward) transitions can
populate both ground state hyperﬁne levels. For clarity, not all possible transitions
are drawn in.

4. Hyperﬁne spectroscopy

If the nuclear spin I is not zero, ground and excited states of Li-like
ions exhibit a hyperﬁne splitting. The 2S1/2 and the 2P1/2 states are
split only by the magnetic hyperﬁne interaction while for the 2P3/2 also
the quadrupole interaction contributes. The hyperﬁne splitting of the
2S1/2 ground-state is typically in the order of 0.5 eV [see, e.g., Shabaev
et al. 1998, or Boucard et al. 2000]. It will be shown in the following
2S1/2
that a hyperﬁne structure of the 2P1/2 −
transition can be investigated by laser spectroscopy as well.

2S1/2 or even the 2P3/2 −

The experimental setup is depicted in ﬁgure 5. It might be advan-

tageous to use two laser beams, one pumping, e.g., the Fg = I
→
Fe = I + 1/2 transition, and the other the Fg = I + 1/2
Fe = I + 1/2
one. Otherwise the signal may cease rapidly because of depopulation
pumping. The relative line width ∆~ω0/~ω0 = ∆γb/γ of a transition is
entirely determined by the energy distribution of the Li-like ions in a
bunch which is in the order of ∆γb/γ = 10−4. Therefore, a line width
∆~ω0
0.03 eV is expected which may be small enough to resolve the
hyperﬁne pattern.

Since in such an experiment only small relative energy changes of
the hyperﬁne components must be measured, a high resolution X-ray
detector is not required. A large area detector placed in forward direc-
tion can be used. This has the advantage that the accepted solid angle
can be increased by a large factor, see ﬁgure 3. For an accepted polar
angle of Θ = 4 mrad only, the relative accepted solid angle in the rest
frame of the Li-like system is ∆Ω0/(4π) = 0.0104, i.e., in the order
of 1 %. Consequently, the count rate is expected to be rather high.
10−3, frep = 104/s, NLi = 1,
Indeed, with (∆νL/νL)/(∆γb/γ) = 5.3
N0,sat = 3.7, ∆Ω0/(4π) = 0.0104, and εX = 0.5 the count rate is
according to equation (23) ˙NX = 1.0/s. Notice, that in principle only
one stored ion is required for the envisaged hyperﬁne spectroscopy!
However, it is not at all clear that the X-ray detector may be located
in forward direction because of expected excess background count rates.
But even if a deﬂection of the X-ray beam out of the forward direction
is necessary, e.g., by a pyrolytic graphite crystal which accepts a much
larger bandwidth as a single crystal monochromator, the count rate
may be suﬃciently large with a few tens of Li-like ions in a bunch. Al-
ternatively, the frequency of the pulse laser may be increased. Thereby
the event rate increases linearly until the circulation frequency of the
ions in the ring of about 275 kHz has been reached. It might also be
suﬃcient to pump only with one laser beam and allow for depopulation
pumping if the count rate is high enough.

This kind of hyperﬁne spectroscopy at Li-like ions has a number
of advantages. First of all, hyperﬁne ﬁelds can be calculated with a
very high accuracy, at least with a much better accuracy as for neutral
atoms which is typically 10 % for the isotope shift and 3 % for hyperﬁne
ﬁelds. This fact is of great importance since relative measurements
can be avoided allowing a direct access to the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect.
Secondly, isotope shifts and magnetic hyperﬁne splittings can be mea-
sured for any element via the 2P1/2 −
2S1/2 transition. At the highest
relativistic factor γ = 36 even a quadrupole interaction can be studied
2S1/2 transition for all elements with Z
via the 2P3/2 −
50. (For the
2p 2P1/2,3/2 transition energies see Bosselmann et al. 1999,
2s 2S1/2 −
or Johnson et al. 1998.) Finally, it should be mentioned once more
that the sensitivity is very high and only a very few or even only one
radioactive ion may already be suﬃcient for the spectroscopy. However,
such experiments would require a re-injection of radioactive species,
produced by fragmentation reactions, into SIS300 as Li-like ions.

5. Laser cooling

13

The line width of the hyperﬁne components can be improved by several
orders of magnitude by laser cooling as will be demonstrated in the
following. 4 Momentum can be transferred to the Li-like ion by absorp-
tion of a laser photon as well as by re-emission of the X-ray. While
the former momentum transfer is only ~ωL/c, the latter is according to
equation (12) in the order γ2~ωL/c since the angular distribution of the
X-rays is strongly peaked into forward direction, see subsection 3.2. The
mean longitudinal momentum transfer in the laboratory system due to
absorption and emission of a photon of energy ~ω0 in the rest frame of
the Li-like system is in the laboratory frame given by

Here (~ω0/c) cos Θ/(γ(1
β cos Θ) is the longitudinal momentum trans-
fer to the the Li-like ion in the laboratory system by emission of a
photon of momentum ~ω0/c in the rest frame of the ion. This relation
follows from equation (11) for −→ψ = 0 and θ = Θ after division by
c, which transforms the photon energy into the photon momentum,
and the projection of the momentum on the velocity axis of the Li-like
ion. The function f (cos Θ0) = 1 represents the angular distribution of
the photon in the rest frame of the Li-like ion which is assumed to
be isotropic. In equation (25) the solid angle is transformed by means
of equation (7) into the laboratory system in which the integration is
carried out. The integral of equation (25) can be solved analytically.
The ﬁnal result on the right hand side of equation (26) has been ob-
tained with equation (10) for Ψ = 0 after appropriate reshapings 5. The

10−9. A total energy shift ∆γb/γ = 10−4 requires a small de-tuning of
the laser frequency in such a manner that ﬁrst only the ions with largest
energies are optically pumped. These are shifted to lower energies by a
gradual increase of the laser frequency. In this manner successively more
and more ions of the bunch are included in the pumping process. For a
complete cooling cycle at least a number (∆γb/γ)/(δγ/γ) of transitions
is required.

The rate at which γ varies at saturation follows for a pulse laser
system with pulse width ∆tpulse and repetition rate frep from equations

6. Nuclear polarization by optical pumping

A few remarks will be added on the possibility to prepare a polarized
Li-like ion beam which exhibits also a nuclear polarization if the nuclear
spin is not zero. As schematically shown in ﬁgure 6, pumping with left-
circularly polarized laser light results after many transitions ﬁnally in
a population of only the
Zeeman
level, because this level can not be pumped anymore. In this state the
electronic spin as well as the nuclear spin are polarized as sketched
schematically in the vector coupling model inset in ﬁgure 6.

F = I + 1/2, MF =

(I + 1/2)
i

−

Unfortunately, a polarization may probably not be maintained within
the SIS300 ring since in the strong magnetic ﬁeld of the bending mag-
nets and beam optical elements a polarized total angular momentum −→F
precesses and may randomize. However, it might be conceivable that
an external Li-like beam may be pumped in a long straight section,
for instance by 100 ns long circularly polarized laser beams which
would induce, according to equation (14), N0,sat = 32 transitions in an
unpolarized Li-like ion. This is a rather large number and the attained
polarization may already be high. For Li-like ions with Z
50, it could
2S1/2 transition and even much
be pumped via the much faster 2P3/2 −
larger numbers may be attained at even shorter laser pulse durations.

which were beyond the scope of this work.

7. Conclusions

Precision transition energies ~ω0 as well as relativistic factors γ can
be measured for Li-like ions at the future heavy ion accelerator SIS300
if the inherently very precise laser spectroscopy method is combined
with a precision X-ray energy measurement of ﬂuorescence photons
by means of a single crystal monochromator. Isotope shifts and mag-
2S1/2 transition for
netic moments can be measured at the 2P1/2 −
2S1/2
all elements, and quadrupole moments for Z
transition, in principle even at a single stored radioactive species far
oﬀ stability if their nuclear spin is known. Heavy ion beams in SIS300
may be laser cooled, and polarized external heavy ion beams may be
prepared by optical pumping with polarized laser beams.

Abstract

The use of coordinate variables with independent physical boundaries – Heron variables – is
proposed for the 3-body problem. The ansatz is given for variational trial wave functions without
local energy inﬁnities at the Coulomb singularities.

Introduction. Heron variables

The wave function of a bound system in a ground state depends only on interparticle distances. There
are three distances r1, r2 and r3 for 3-body systems, six for 4-body and so on. Though the distances are
locally independent and admit unconstrained partial diﬀerentiation, the physical boundaries for each of
them depend on the values of the others. The triangle inequalities take place:

0 ≤ |r2 − r3| ≤ r1 ≤ r2 + r3 < ∞,
0 ≤ |r1 − r3| ≤ r2 ≤ r1 + r3 < ∞,
0 ≤ |r1 − r2| ≤ r3 ≤ r1 + r2 < ∞.

More symmetrical Hylleraas variables [1]

s = r1 + r2, t = |r1 − r2|, u = r3

are used for decades in the variational calculations of the 3-body systems. These variables are also
subjected to the physical region inequalities:

0 ≤ t ≤ u ≤ s < ∞.

All such variables with mutual constraints are not fully independent, and this causes deﬁnite technical

diﬃculties in calculations.

Meanwhile, there are coordinate variables with independent physical boundaries. They are known for
millenniums since the discovery by Heron (Alexandria, 1st century A.D. ) of the triangle area formula [2]

The Heron variables

S = pp(p − a)(p − b)(p − c), p = (a + b + c)/2.

p − a = h1 = (−r1 + r2 + r3)/2,
p − b = h2 = (r1 − r2 + r3)/2,
p − c = h3 = (r1 + r2 − r3)/2

span separately over the physical region

0 ≤ h1 < ∞, 0 ≤ h2 < ∞, 0 ≤ h3 < ∞.

They are fully independent, that leads to great simpliﬁcation in variational calculations. The repeated
integrals turn to multiple integrals, which reduce to one-dimensional integrals, if the trial wave functions
are appropriately chosen.

The equivalent variables, without referring to Heron and now usually named as perimetric variables,

were proposed in [3] and eﬀectively used in [4] and other works.3

1 Ansatz for variational trial wave functions

For Helium and Helium-like ions the simplest ground state function can be chosen as follows:

ψ = exp(−Zr1 − Zr2 + r3/2).

If an electron pair were isolated, the exact solution ψee = exp(r3/2) of the Schr¨odinger equation with
repulsive Coulomb potential would be unphysical because of unrestricted exponential growth. Being
embedded into the wave function of a whole bound system, the exponent with the plus sign in front of
r3 does not produce unrestricted exponential growth in the 3-body conﬁguration space. Transition to
Heron variables

r1 = h2 + h3, r2 = h1 + h3, r3 = h1 + h2

exposes exponential decrease on each variable:

ψ = exp(−(Z − 1/2)h1 − (Z − 1/2)h2 − 2Zh3).

The mean energy value, calculated with this function is

Hmean = −

(−1 + 2Z)(1 − 8Z + 28Z 2 − 64Z 3)
4(−1 + 10Z − 32Z 2)

.

This value is obtained without any parameters for adjustment, as at this lowest level of approximation

no minimization procedure was performed.

It is instructive to compare the approximation qualities of the proposed wave function with that of

the variational wave function with one adjustable parameter – the eﬀective charge:

The one parameter mean energy value

Zef f = Z − 5/16, ψef f = exp(−Zef f r1 − Zef f r2).

Hmean(Zef f ) = −(Z − 5/16)2

shows for all Z only a little bit bigger deviation from the energy eigenvalues, as the parameterless

formula (10) does, but the local properties of ψef f are much worse than that of ψ.

The so-called local energy, deﬁned as

Elocal = Hψef f /ψef f ,

takes inﬁnite values at the Coulomb singularities [5].

On the contrary, the local energy, attributed to the proposed function (7), has bounded variation in

the whole physical region of variables.

As one can judge with the known literature, almost all used up to now variational wave functions are

plagued with the local energy inﬁnities, in spite of the huge number of their parameters.

How to avoid local energy inﬁnities at any approximation stage? The simplest ansatz for good trial
function is suggested on by the presented example of the wave function in the lowest approximation. It
is suﬃcient to have a linear superposition of triple products, formed by the exact Coulomb solutions for
each pair of the particles involved.

The building blocks are:

ψ(n, l = 0) = exp(−ar/n) 1F1(1 − n, 2, 2ar/n),
ψi(n, l = 1) = ri exp(−ar/n) 1F1(2 − n, 4, 2ar/n),
ψij (n, l = 2) = (δij r2 − 3rirj) exp(−ar/n) 1F1(3 − n, 6, 2ar/n),

· · ·

.

In ( 14) ~r = ~r1, ~r2, or ~r3, n = n1, n2, or n3 and a = Z, or a = −1/2 correspondingly.
The individual principal quantum number n need not to be integer, and can be treated as an adjustable
parameter in a truncated hypergeometrical series. Each term of the linear superposition should not violate
the condition of integral convergence: M ax(n1, n2) < 2Zn3. The intermediate vector indices should be
summed in all possible ways according to transformation properties of the whole system state. And the
symmetrization or antisymmetrization on the variables ~r1, ~r2 should be performed.

2 Axial states of a 3-body system

Let’s apply the proposed ansatz to the 3-body state, when the relative angular momenta of each pair of
particles form an overall P -state with positive parity – the axial state.

In the lowest approximation the axial wave function is

The mean energy value is calculated as

˜ψi = exp(−Zr1/2 − Zr2/2 + r3/4)ǫijkr1jr2k.

H ax

mean =

(−1 + 2Z)(−1 + 14Z − 84Z 2 + 280Z 3 − 512Z 4)
16(−1 + 16Z − 100Z 2 + 256Z 3)

.

Though the energy level of this doubly excited state is well above the ground level, the axial state is
stable against autoionization. For symmetry reasons, the autoionization of an axial state cannot proceed
to the ﬁnal 2-body ground state, which is scalar state. For energy reasons, it also cannot proceed to
the ﬁnal 2-body 2P -state, that follows from the lowest approximation formula ( 16) for Z > 1 and was
established for the Hydrogen negative ion in [6].

Long range scattering resonances in strong-ﬁeld seeking states of polar molecules

(Dated: November 18, 2013)

We present ﬁrst steps toward understanding the ultracold scattering properties of polar molecules
in strong electric ﬁeld-seeking states. We have found that the elastic cross section displays a quasi-
regular set of potential resonances as a function of the electric ﬁeld, which potentially oﬀers intimate
details about the inter-molecular interaction. We illustrate these resonances in a “toy” model
composed of pure dipoles, and in more physically realistic systems. To analyze these resonances,
we use a simple WKB approximation to the eigenphase, which proves both reasonably accurate and
meaningful. A general treatment of the Stark eﬀect and dipolar interactions is also presented.

INTRODUCTION

tunable in energy using magnetic ﬁelds [6].

Conventional spectroscopy of atoms and molecules be-
gins with the premise that the energy levels of the species
being probed are ﬁxed although they may shift slightly
in electromagnetic ﬁelds. These levels are then interro-
gated by energy-dependent probes such as photons or
charged or neutral particles.
Information on the ener-
getics and structure of the molecules is extracted from
absorption energies, oscillator strengths, selection rules,
etc. In these investigations, the study of resonances has
played a central role.

With the advent of ultracold environments for atoms
and molecules, this general view of spectroscopy can be
inverted. Cold collisions provide a nearly monochromatic
probe of near-threshold intermolecular interactions, with
resolution set by the milliKelvin or microKelvin tem-

nearby resonant states can be tuned into resonance with
the zero-energy collisions. For cold gases of alkali atoms,
this strategy is already in widespread use. It exploits the
fact that the Zeeman eﬀect can shift the internal energies
of the atoms over ranges orders of magnitude larger than
the collision energy itself. In this way, atoms can be made
to resonate when they would not naturally do so (i.e., in
zero ﬁeld). Measurement of these “Feshbach” resonances
(more properly, Fano-Feshbach resonances) has yielded
the most accurate determination of alkali-alkali potential
energy surfaces for near-threshold processes [1].

The current experimental and theoretical push to cre-
ate and study ultracold molecules [2] will lead to many
more opportunities for this novel kind of spectroscopy,
since molecules possess many more internal degrees of
freedom than do atoms. There will be, for example, nu-
merous Fano-Feshbach resonances in which one or both of
the collision partners becomes vibrationally or rotation-
ally excited [3, 4, 5]; statistical arguments suggest that
these resonances will be quite narrow in energy, a fact re-
lated to their abundance [3]. A second class of resonant
states will occur when the constituents are excited into
higher-lying ﬁne structure or hyperﬁne structure states,
more reminiscent of the resonances observed in the alkali
atoms. In molecules, these resonances are naturally also

In this paper, we are primarily interested in a third
class of resonance: potential resonances that are engen-
dered by altering the intermolecular potential energy sur-
face itself. This capability becomes especially prominent
in cold collisions of heteronuclear polar molecules, whose
dipolar interactions are quite strong on the scale of the
low translational temperatures of the gas. At the same
time, the dipole moments of the individual dipoles can
be strengthened or weakened as well as aligned by an
applied electric ﬁeld.

This kind of resonance includes the shape resonances,
discussed in the context of cold atoms polarized by strong
electric ﬁelds [7, 8]. A second set, dubbed “ﬁeld-linked”
resonances, has been studied in some detail
in Refs
[9, 10, 11]. These states appear in potential energy sur-
faces (PES’s) that correlate to weak electric ﬁeld-seeking
states of the free molecules. They are weakly bound,
long-ranged in character, and indeed do not appear to
exist without an electric ﬁeld present. Similar resonances
are predicted to occur in metastable states of the alkaline
earth elements at low temperatures [12, 13].

A rich set of potential resonances emerges among
strong-ﬁeld seeking states, and this is the subject of
the present paper. Strong-ﬁeld seekers are of increas-
ing importance experimentally, since they would enable
molecules to be trapped in their absolute ground states
where no 2-body inelastic collision processes are available
to harm the gas. In this case, the colliding molecules are
free to approach to within a small internuclear distance of
one another; the resulting potential resonances therefore
can probe detailed intermolecular dynamics near thresh-
old. The resulting data, consisting of scattering peaks as
a function of electric ﬁeld, can be thought of as a kind of
“Stark spectroscopy”. Just such a tool has been applied
previously in precision measurements of alkali Rydberg
spectra [14, 15].

In this paper we explore such spectra in ultracold
molecules, ﬁnding that the spectrum is dominated by
a quasi-regular series in the electric ﬁeld values. Such
a series is the fundamental building block of molecular
Stark spectroscopy and plays a role analogous to the

perturbed Rydberg series, encapsulated in the quantum
defects, yields information on the electron-core interac-
tion [16, 17]. Similarly, it is expected that diﬀerences
in observed Stark spectra from those presented here will
probe the short-range intermolecular interactions.

To emphasize the generality of these resonances, we
ﬁrst brieﬂy develop in Sec.
II a general formalism
for arbitrary polar collision partners, covering explicitly
Hund’s cases (a) and (b) as well as asymmetric rotor
molecules. Using this formalism, we introduce in Sec.
III the potential resonances using a simpliﬁed version of
the molecular gas in which all dipoles are assumed to
be perfectly aligned and where molecular ﬁne structure
plays no role. In Sec. IV, we consider the case of more
realistic molecules, where ﬁne structure does intervene.
We show that the structure of the potential resonances
is unchanged, but that additional narrow Fano-Feshbach
resonances do appear. Throughout the article we em-
phasize how the various types of resonance can be classi-
ﬁed and organized by simple considerations involving the
WKB approximation.

II. GENERAL FORM OF THE STARK EFFECT
AND DIPOLAR INTERACTION

In this section, we brieﬂy recapitulate our scattering
model which is presented in Refs.[10, 18, 19]. The molec-
ular scattering Hamiltonian can be written as

H = T0 + VSR + VLR + HS + Hint

(1)

Where T0 is the kinetic energy operator, VSR is the short
range potential energy surface (PES), VLR is the long
range interaction of the polar molecules, HS is the Stark
Hamiltonian, and Hint is the Hamiltonian describing the
internal degrees of freedom of the molecules. For the
purpose of this paper we disregard VSR. The long range
interaction is dominated by the dipole-dipole interac-
tion [10]. Furthermore an electric ﬁeld can signiﬁcantly
change the structure of the interaction and be used to
control the molecular collisions [10, 18].

The ﬁrst step in performing a scattering calculation is
to construct a basis of molecular energy eigenstates in an
external ﬁeld. Here we generalize the approach slightly
to make it applicable to various types of polar molecules.
Once the Stark Hamiltonian is obtained, the result can
be used in the Hamiltonian of the dipolar interaction,
showing their common physical origin in terms of electric
ﬁelds.

To simplify the analysis and calculations, we assume
that the vibrational degrees of freedom are frozen out at
low temperatures; hence can treat the molecules as rigid
rotors. The molecular state is described in terms of the
state

lar axis. To describe the rigid rotor molecular wave func-
tion, we use

where α, β, and γ are the Euler angles deﬁning the molec-
ular axis and DJ⋆

A. The Stark eﬀect

Since the electric ﬁeld is a true vector (as opposed to
a pseudovector), it only couples states of opposite parity.
This implies that the Stark energies vary quadratically
with low electric ﬁeld; they vary linearly only at higher
ﬁelds once the Stark energy is greater than the energy
splitting of the two states. The Stark Hamiltonian has
the form

HS =

For the current discussion, we pursue a general approach
and allow the ﬁeld to point in any direction in the lab-
oratory reference frame. This general approach allows
the matrix elements to be used in the dipolar interac-
tion. However when explicitly considering the molecular
states in an electric ﬁeld, we that the ﬁeld lies in the ˆz
direction.

The Stark interaction can be evaluated by decompos-
ing the electric ﬁeld in spherical coordinates and then
rotating the dipole into the lab frame.
In this repre-
sentation, the Stark Hamiltonian has the form HS =

and q is the projection quantum number of

the operator D1⋆ coupling two molecular states, which
themselves are described by D functions. The Stark ma-
trix element is an integral of three D-functions over the
molecular coordinates, averaging over molecular orienta-
tion. The evaluation of the integral results in selection
rules whose details depend on the molecular speciﬁcs.
For a valuable qualitative discussion on the Stark eﬀect

A given molecule may also have a nuclear spin that
generates a hyperﬁne structure. In this case, it is more
appropriate to present the matrix elements in the hyper-
ﬁne basis, where F and MF deﬁne the state. Here F is
the sum of J and the nuclear spin I and MF is the pro-
jection of F in the lab frame. We use the Wigner-Eckart
theorem to compute the Stark matrix elements in a com-
pact form. The matrix elements of the Stark eﬀect are
written as

reduced matrix elements [21].

This formalism is easily extended to include asym-
metric rotors by including the rotational Hamiltonian
to construct molecular eigenstates. For an asymmetric
rotor, there are three distinct moments of inertia and
therefore three distinct rotational constants. The rota-
tional Hamiltonian is Hrot = AJ2
c , where
A > B > C and a, b and c are the axis labels in the molec-
ular frame. This additional structure mixes Ω such that
it is not a good quantum number, implying we that need
to diagonalize the rotational Hamiltonian along with the
Stark Hamiltonian to obtain the molecular eigenstates.
We consider the primary eﬀect of this additional struc-
ture to change the progression of rotationally excited
states. For a complete discussion on asymmetric rotors

Equation (9) shows that once the Stark Hamiltonian
has been constructed for a particular molecule, then the
Hamiltonian describing the dipolar interaction can be
achieved with little extra eﬀort. This result reﬂects the
fact that in Eq. (9) each dipole is acted on by the elec-
tric ﬁeld of the other. We have also used a shorthand

To exploit an analogy with Rydberg atoms, the long
range Coulombic interaction is well understood. With
this understanding of the long range physics, a solution
to the complete problem is achieved by matching it to
the short range solution or a parameterization of the
short range interaction [17]. This idea was, in fact, im-
plemented as a numerical tool in Ref.[8], which dealt with
collisions of atoms in strong electric ﬁelds. To this end,
we pursue an understanding of the long range character-
istics of the dipolar scattering. We then envision merging
the long range physics with the short range physics, or
a parametrization thereof, to oﬀer insight into the short
range interaction and to explore the dynamic interaction
of polar molecules. With this idea in mind we ﬁrst ex-
plore “pure” dipolar scattering.

III. DIPOLAR SCATTERING

Our primary interest in polar molecule scattering is
how the strong anisotropic interaction aﬀects the sys-
tem. As a ﬁrst step illustrating the inﬂuence of dipolar
interactions, we present a simple model composed of po-
larized dipoles with no internal structure. Strictly speak-
ing, this system is created by an inﬁnitely strong electric
ﬁeld that completely polarizes the molecules and raises
all other internal states to experimentally unattainable
energies. Thus the only label required for a channel is
its partial wave, l =

dipole interaction are taken to be

, which is typical for molecules like

RbCs or SrO. We then artiﬁcially vary the dipole mo-
ment µ to see the eﬀect of an increasingly strong dipolar
interaction. Pragmatically speaking, varying µ parallels
changing the electric ﬁeld. The intention of this model
is to focus on the eﬀect of direct anisotropic couplings
between the degenerate channels, as measured by their
eﬀect on the partial wave channels.

For this model, we use a reduced mass of mr = 104

of orbital angular momentum is relevant. To set a con-
crete boundary condition at small R, we apply “hard
wall” boundary conditions, ψ(Rin) = 0 at a character-
istic radius Rin = 20 a.u. (In Sec. V we will relax this
restriction.) We pick the collision energy to be nearly

and numerical integration of the Schr¨odinger equation

propagator method of Johnson [25].

×

To get a sense of the inﬂuence of increasing the dipole
moment, we ﬁrst look at adiabatic curves of the system.
Figure 1 (a) shows two diﬀerent sets of adiabatic curves:
a gray set with µ = 0.1 (a.u.) and a black set µ = 1.0
(a.u.). In each set, the four lowest adiabatic curves are
shown. Looking at these curves, we can see two charac-
teristic eﬀects of increasing µ. First, the lowest curve be-
comes much deeper. Second, the higher adiabatic curves,

originating form non-zero partial waves, may support
bound states at short distance states, i.e. within the cen-
trifugal barrier. Both these eﬀect may generate bound
states, leading to distinct classes of scattering resonances
as µ is varied. The deepening of the lowest adiabatic
curves induces potential resonances, whereas the higher-
lying curves lead to narrow shape resonances, wherein the
molecules must tunnel through the centrifugal barrier.

The diﬀerent classes of resonances can clearly be seen
in cross section, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The broad
quasi-regular set of resonances seen in the cross section
are the potential resonances originating from the lowest
adiabatic curve. The narrow shape resonances appearing
sporadically in the spectrum originate from the higher-
lying curves. For the purpose of this paper, we focus on
the wide potential resonances and simply acknowledge
the existence of the narrow shape resonances.

To show that the broad resonances primarily belong
to the lowest potential and the narrow shape resonances
belong to the higher-lying potentials, we use an eigen-
phase analysis. The eigenphase can be thought of as the
sum of the phase shifts for all of the channels; thus it
tracks the behavior of all the channels simultaneously.
The eigenphase is deﬁned as

φeigen =

tan

−1(λK

i ).

(11)

i
X

Here λK
i are the eigenvalues of the K matrix from the full-
scattering calculation [26]. (The K matrix is related to
the more familiar scattering matrix by S = (1 + iK)/(1
−
iK).) When the system gains a bound state, it appears
as a π jump in eigenphase. The eigenphase of the system
is shown in Fig. 2 (a), as the solid line with many abrupt
steps.

To analyze this situation further, we construct an ap-
proximate eigenphase as follows. First, we asses the to-
tal phase accumulated in each adiabatic channel, using a
WKB prescription:

W KB(µ) =

2mrV (i)

channels that possess a barrier to scattering at zero col-
lision energy, the limits of integration are from Rin to
the inner classical turning point of the barrier. This will
yield some information on shape resonances trapped be-
hind the barrier, but we will not make much of this in the
analysis to follow. Finally, we add together the individ-
ual WKB phases to produce an approximate eigenphase
shift, which we dub the “adiabatic WKB phase” (AWP):

W KB passes through

with non-zero partial waves (φ(2,3)
W KB). The gray bracket in-
dicates where the sum of these contributions pass through a
multiple of π.

Since we are not concerned with properties of the phase
associated with the higher-lying adiabatic curves, we do
not consider the connection formula now.

The total AWP for this system is shown as a dashed
line in Fig. 2 (a). It tracks the eigenphase well but of-
fers more information if we decompose the AWP into its
contributions. Figure 2 (b) shows the individual con-
tributions of the sum. The largest contribution is the
phase from the lowest adiabatic curve, which can be as-
sociated with potential resonances. A black bracket ap-
pears above this phase contribution with vertical marks
indicating when it passes through an integer multiple of
π, i.e., when we expect to see a potential resonance in

the cross section. This same bracket is plotted in Fig. 1
and shows good agreement between the locations of the
potential resonances and the AWP predictions. We con-
clude from this that the main resonance features in the
Stark spectrum arise primarily from this single potential
curve.

In Fig. 2 (b) the two remaining phase contributions
originate from non-zero partial wave channels that pos-
sess centrifugal barriers; see Fig. 1(b). The gray bracket
indicates where the sum of these two contributions pass
through an integer multiple of π, and thus represent a
guess for where the shape resonances lie. This gray
bracket is also shown in Fig. 1. The agreement with
the position of the narrow resonance features in the cross
section is not nearly as good as it is with the broad poten-
tial resonances. This indicates a more involved criterion
for shape resonances. Nevertheless, the AWP predicts
15 shape resonances, and there are 13 in the range of µ
shown. The AWP appears to oﬀer a means to roughly
predict the number of shape resonances in this system,
even though it does not predict the locations exactly.

A main point of this analysis is that the AWP in the
lowest adiabatic channel alone is suﬃcient to locate the
potential (as opposed to shape) resonances, without fur-
ther modiﬁcation. For the rest of this paper, we focus
on the potential resonances in more realistic molecules
with internal molecular structure. The general analysis
in terms of a single-channel AWP will still hold, but an
additional phase shift will be required to describe the
spectrum.

IV. STRONG FIELD SEEKERS

Strong-ﬁeld-seeking molecules are approximately de-
scribed as polarized in the sense of the last section, be-
cause their dipole moments are aligned with the ﬁeld.
They will, however, contain a richer resonance structure
owing to the presence of low-lying excited states that can
alter the dipolar potential energy surface at small-R.

For concreteness, we focus here on molecules with a
1Σ ground state. Heteronulcear alkalis ﬁt into this cat-
egory and are rapidly approaching ground state produc-
tion with various species [27]. As examples, we pick RbCs
and SrO in their ground states. Ground state RbCs has
been produced experimentally [28]. As for SrO, promis-
ing new techniques should lead to experimental results
soon [29]. For simplicity we include only the J = 0, J = 1
rotational states, and freeze the projection of molecular
angular momentum to MJ = 0. This restricts the num-
ber of scattering thresholds to three, identiﬁed by the
parity quantum number of the molecules in zero ﬁeld.
The parity quantum numbers for the three thresholds
are (
+, ++). This model is similar to the one pre-

[10] which can be easily constructed for

any rigid rotor when only including two molecular states.
One immediate consequence of multiple thresholds is the
presence of rotational Fano-Feshbach resonances in the

collisional spectrum.

The ﬁrst example is RbCs, whose physical parameters
are µ = 1.3 D, mr = 110 a.m.u., and Be = 0.0245(K)
[28]. As before, we apply vanishing boundary condition
at Rin = 20 a.u. To converge this calculation over the
ﬁeld range considered, we require partial waves up to
l = 30. We ﬁrst look at the adiabatic curves of the system
to get an understanding of how the real system deviates
from the simple model presented above. In Fig. 3 (a) we
plot the 6 lowest adiabatic curves for the RbCs system
with only four partial waves, so the ﬁgure is more easily
interpreted. The sets of adiabatic curves shown are for
=0 and the
two diﬀerent ﬁeld values: the gray set has
black set has
= 5000 (V/cm). There are two important
features that diﬀer from the dipole example. First, there
are two higher thresholds, and the electric ﬁeld shifts

electric ﬁeld dramatically changes the radial dependence
of the Hamiltonian.

The diﬀerence in thresholds can be seen clearly in Fig.
3 (a) where the lowest excited threshold moves from
0.05(K) at
=5000 (V/cm). The
diﬀerence in radial dependences for the two cases is seen
more clearly in a log-log plot of the two lowest adiabatic
curves for both ﬁelds, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). The gray
set corresponding to zero ﬁeld has two distinct asymp-
totic radial powers. At large R the lowest adiabatic curve
has a 1/R6 behavior asymptotically because of couplings
with channels far away in energy [
0.05(K)]. However
as R approaches zero the dipolar interaction has over-
whelmed the rotational energy separation and the radial
dependence becomes 1/R3 in character at about R=100
(a.u.). For reference, the dashed line is proportional to
1/R3. With
= 5000 (V/cm), the two black curves show
the radial dependence of the adiabatic curves. The lowest
curve now has nearly 1/R3 over the whole range shown.
Asymptotically when the centrifugal barrier is larger, the
radial dependence will change to 1/R4 [10]. The second
lowest adiabatic curve is also signiﬁcantly altered by the
strong dipolar interaction as can be seen in Fig. 3 (b).

∼

E

In Fig. 4 (a), we plot the cross section for the model
RbCs system. This spectrum is riddled with narrow
Fano-Feshbach resonances, but is still dominated by a
series of potential resonances similar to the one in Fig.
1 (b). There are two sets of AWP predictions shown as
over-brackets. To understand their diﬀerence, we look
to Fig. 4 (b). The AWP for the lowest adiabatic curve
is shown in Fig. 4 (b) for two diﬀerent zero-ﬁeld phase
values. The gray curve is the AWP that is directly com-
puted from the method described above, Eq. (12). The
locations where it passes through an integer multiple of
π are indicated by the gray triangles. Referring back to
Fig. 4 (a), where the same gray triangles appear we see
that this simple estimate does not reproduce the reso-
nance position.

We can, however, introduce an additional overall phase
shift to account for the diﬀerence in short-range interac-
tions from the pure polarized case. The shifted AWP
reads

˜φ(1)
W KB(
E

) = φ(1)

W KB(
E

) + πδdef ect.

(13)

By treating δdef ect as a ﬁtting parameter, we can obtain
the resonance positions indicated by the black bracket
in Fig. 4, which agree quite well with the resonance
positions in the close-coupled calculation. To do so re-
quires, in this case, a phase shift δdef ect = 0.14. In anal-
ogy with Rydberg spectroscopy we consider the shift we
have added to be a “quantum defect” that accounts for
the eﬀect of the short-range interaction. The additional
phase shift reﬂects the inﬂuence of short range physics on
the scattering, such as curve crossings with curves from
higher thresholds.

The AWP also saturates with ﬁeld, as can be seen in
Fig. 4 (b). This occurs because the electric ﬁeld eventu-

ally fully polarizes the molecules, so the dipole moment
cannot increase further. The eﬀect can also be seen in
the spacing of the potential resonances. At low ﬁelds,
the potential resonances occur frequently in ﬁeld. Then,
as the ﬁeld is further increased, the resonances occur less
often in ﬁeld, which is a signature of dipole moment satu-
rating and therefore an increasing ﬁeld having less eﬀect
on the molecular interaction.

As a second example, we consider SrO, which has the
physical parameters mr=52 a.m.u, µ=8.9 D, and Be =
0.5 K [29]. We choose this molecule for its compara-
tively large mass and dipole moment, which guarantee a
large number of resonances. Fig. 5 we have plotted the

8

With a clear understanding of this interaction and how it
induces resonances, it could be exploited to learn about
the short range interaction of the molecules. This is be-
cause details of where the lines appear must also depend
on the boundary condition experienced by the wave func-
tion at small values of R. Therefore the spectrum con-
tains information on the small R intermolecular dynam-
ics. Thus by studying the potential resonance series we
can extract information about the short range dynamics.
This idea is similar to quantum defect theory, which,
for example, has been very successful in Rydberg spec-
troscopy. The short range physics of the electron inter-
acting with the nucleus is complicated and not easily
solved. However once the electron is out of the small
R region, it enters into a pure coulomb potential where
the motion of the electron is well understood. The eﬀect
of the short range must be merged with the long range
physics to form a complete solution. To account for the
short range interaction, the energy can be parameterized
by replacing the principal quantum number by an eﬀec-
tive quantum number n⋆ = n
µ. This procedure is
tantamount to identifying an additional phase shift due
to the interaction of the electron with the atomic core.
The idea of merging standard long range physics with
complicated short range behavior has been applied suc-
cessfully not only in Rydberg states of atoms [17, 30] and
molecules [31], but also in atomic collisions [32], cold col-
lisions [33, 34, 35], and dipole-dipole interactions of the
type we envision here [8].

−

As a simple expression of this idea, we can alter the
boundary condition applied at Rin when performing the
full scattering calculation and note its inﬂuence on the
ﬁeld dependent spectrum. For the above calculations
we have imposed the standard vanishing boundary con-
dition, ψ(Rin) = 0 for all channels. We now replace
this condition with a uniform logarithmic derivative,
dR ψ)ψ−1, at Rin. Thus previously we set b =
b = ( d
,
∞
but now we allow b to vary. The log-derivative is conve-
niently represented as a phase:

b = cotan(πβ),

(14)

∞

where β can lie between zero and one, covering all values
of b from
. For β = 0, the boundary condition
is the one employed above, ψ(Rin) = 0, whereas for β =
0.5, the boundary condition is d

to +

−∞

dR ψ(Rin) = 0.

We have re-computed the collisional spectrum of RbCs
for several diﬀerent initial conditions, and plotted the
(b), in Fig. 6 as
ﬁeld values of the potential resonances,
sets of points. The values of β for the diﬀerent calcula-
tions are 0 (ﬁlled circle), 0.11 (ﬁlled square), 0.22 (ﬁlled
triangle), 0.56 (hollow circle), 0.78 (hollow square), and
0.89 (hollow triangle). The ﬁlled circles are resonant lo-
cations for cross section in Fig. 4 (a).

We next wish to demonstrate that each such spectrum
can be identiﬁed by a single quantum defect parameter,
as was done in the previous section. This entails picking
a value of δdef ect and then setting the phase ˜φ(1)

cross section for SrO, which is dominated by the quasi-
regular potential resonance series. As before, the black
bracket indicates where the phase shifted AWP predicts
the potential resonances, and we see the agreement is
good. Furthermore, the series has not terminated since
we have not completely polarized the dipole. The series
of potential resonances saturates at 17.5 (kV/cm) after
a total of 43 potential resonances have been induced. To
line up the AWP’s predictions and the actual cross sec-
tion requires a defect of δdef ect = 0.215.

We have picked two examples to illustrate how the po-
tential resonances will appear in the context of collisional
spectroscopy. These resonance will occur to varying de-
grees in the strong-ﬁeld seeking collisions of all polar
molecules. For example, we can also make similar predic-
tions for an asymmetric rotor molecule such as formalde-
hyde (H2CO). We ﬁnd that this molecule should possess
six potential resonances in the ﬁeld interval from 0 to 50
(kV /cm).

It is worth noting that portions of similar resonance
series was anticipated in cold atomic gases subjected to
electric ﬁelds [8]. However very few such resonances are
likely to be observed, owning to the enormous ﬁelds (
∼
M V /cm) required to generate them. In polar molecules,
by contrast, the entire series should be readily observable.

V. COLLISIONAL SPECTROSCOPY

Through the course of this work we have shown
that the zero-energy cross section of weak-ﬁeld-seeking
molecules is dominated by a set of broad potential reso-
nances. Even though these resonances are themselves in-
triguing, their properties can be exploited to learn much
more about the system. The general structure of the po-
tential resonances is governed by the long range dipolar
interaction, which has a predictable and common form.

that even with diﬀerent boundary conditions, the single
AWP curve in ﬁg 4 (b) can be used to predict the spac-
ing between the potential resonances by varying a single
parameter, δdef ect. This shows the AWP represents the
long range scattering physics well, and that empirically
extracted parameters like δdef ect will carry information
about the short-range physics such as that embodied in
b.

VI. CONCLUSION

A number of resonant processes may occur when two
polar molecules meet in an ultracold gas. We have
focused here on the dominant, quasi-regular, series of
potential resonances between weak-ﬁeld seeking states.
These potential resonances originate in the direct defor-
mation of the potential energy surface upon which the
molecules scatter. Observation of these resonances may
oﬀer a direct means for probing the short range interac-
tion between molecules. We have provided a means of
analyzing this system with an adiabatic WKB phase in-
tegral. This method shows how the system evolves with
the application of an electric ﬁeld.

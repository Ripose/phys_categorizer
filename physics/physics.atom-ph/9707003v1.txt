Abstract

−

ω2 + ω3
The explicit solution is obtained for four-wave mixing ω4 = ω1
of two strong ﬁelds ~E1, ~E3 and two weak ﬁelds ~E2, ~E4 in a four-level system
with the large Doppler broadening. The resonance of the mixing coeﬃcient
dependence on intensity is found around ~E1 ~d1 = ~E3 ~d3, where ~d1,3 are the
dipole moments of corresponding transitions. The eﬀect is interpreted as an
intersection of quasi-energy levels. Up to 6 peaks appear in the dependence of
conversion coeﬃcient on the detuning of the probe ﬁeld ~E2. An unexpected
additional pair of peaks is a consequence of averaging over velocities and
disappears at low temperature. The results allow us to interpret saturation
behavior in recent experiments on the mixing in sodium vapor.

Four-level system is a promising object for resonant optics and spectroscopy owing to a
great variety of nonlinear eﬀects. They are nonlinear interference, inversionless gain, res-
onance refraction, electromagnetically induced transparency, optically induced energy-level
mixing and shifting, population redistribution etc (see [1,2] and citations therein). Recent ex-
periments on continuous four-wave frequency mixing of Raman type with sodium molecules
in a heat pipe [3,4] gave interesting dependencies of generated wave power on frequencies
and intensities of the incident waves. In particular, the dependence of output power on the
ﬁrst strong ﬁeld intensity was saturated in experiment [3] in thin media, whenever that on
the third wave intensity demonstrated the linear growth. The measurements were taken at
large Doppler broadening while the nonperturbative theory is proposed [5,6] for atoms at
rest. The saturation of four-wave mixing eﬃciency as a function of intensity was observed
in optically thick lead vapor interacted with megawatt pulses [7]. In case the Rabi splitting
exceeded the inhomogeneous width.

Development of nonperturbative theory from the mathematical point of view involves the
solution of the set of 16 algebraic equations for steady-state elements of atomic density matrix
for four-level system. The problem is only of analyzing the resultant awkward expression
and to average it with Maxwellian distribution over velocities. In present paper we study the
particular case of alternate two strong and two weak ﬁelds interacting with 4-level system
having some symmetry. The 4th degree equation can be reduced to biquadratic one, then
the integration is possible analytically.

A simple explicit formula for nonlinear susceptibility at zero frequency detuning displays
the resonant behavior as a function of a strong ﬁeld at ﬁxed another strong ﬁeld. We
interpreted it as the coherent eﬀect owing to the intersection of quasi-energy levels. The
susceptibility as a function of weak ﬁeld frequency ω2, has 6, 4 or 3 peaks. The proﬁle also
displays the important role of the Rabi splitting.

Let us consider the conversion of two strong incident waves ~E1,3 resonantly interacting
with opposite transitions gl, mn and the weak ﬁeld ~E2 near the resonance with transition
gn into the 4-th output wave ~E4, inset of Fig. 1. The electric ﬁeld in the cell is

During the initial step of the mixing the generated ﬁeld is small,

Here elements ρg, ρn, ρ1, ρ3 are deﬁned by Eq. (5), (6), the determinant of set (7) is

the polynomial of 4th degree in velocity. The averaging of coeﬃcient β4 over velocity is
possible by the residues theory for the Doppler limit vT → ∞
To examine the intensity dependence of coeﬃcient β4 let us consider the case of equal
relaxation constants of the levels γj = γ, j = g, l, m, n, excitation of the lower level only

maximal conversion occurs when the Rabi splitting in opposite two-level systems are equal.
Here the cross-transition from the upper sublevel of level m to the upper sublevel of level
n has the same frequency as the transition between their lower sublevels. In this case only
3 resonances remain in the spectrum, Fig. 1 (c), with the overpowering maximum in the
center. The resonance condition
brings the maximum conversion eﬃciency in

The splitting eﬀect is evident from experimental results on resonant four wave mixing in
Na2 [3,4]. The main feature is the saturation of output power as a function of one strong ﬁeld.
The conditions of experiment [3] are generally satisfy the above model: (1) down-conversion

(3) the region of interaction is short enough (nearly 1 cm), the model of thin media can be

consideration the saturation of I4(I1) in the experiment (boxes in Fig. 2) is observed at

Thus, the model explains quantitatively the main features of the measured saturation
curves. To observe the sharp resonances arising from Rabi splitting the stabilization of laser
frequencies seems to be important. To increase the eﬃciency of conversion into the 4th wave
it is necessary to tune up the laser frequencies to corresponding peaks. The optimum at
Ων = 0 corresponds to equal Rabi frequencies

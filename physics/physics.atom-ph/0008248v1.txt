Using a novel NMR scheme we observed persistence in
1-D gas diﬀusion. Analytical approximations and numerical
simulations have shown that for an initially random array
of spins undergoing diﬀusion, the probability p(t) that the
average spin orientation in a given region has not changed sign
(i.e., “persists”) up to time t follows a power law t−θ, where
θ depends on the dimensionality of the system. The large
nuclear spin polarization of laser-polarized 129Xe gas allowed
us both to prepare an initial “quasi-random” 1-D array of spin
orientations and then to perform real-time NMR imaging to
monitor the spin diﬀusion. Our measurements are consistent
with theoretical and numerical predictions of θ ≈ 0.12. We
also observed ﬁnite size eﬀects for long time gas diﬀusion.

The dynamics of non-equilibrium systems is a ﬁeld of
including such topics as phase
great current interest,
ordering in binary alloys, uniaxial ferromagnets, and
nematic liquid crystals, as well as coarsening of soap
froth and diﬀusion of inhomogeneous ﬂuids (e.g. [1]).
The evolving spatio-temporal structures in these non-
equilibrium systems depend crucially on the history of
the system’s evolution and are not completely charac-
terized by simple measures such as two-time correlation
functions, which do not give information on the entire
system history. Therefore, an important problem in the
study of non-equilibrium dynamics is the development of
simple and easily measurable quantities that give non-
trivial information about the history of the system’s evo-
lution. The recently identiﬁed phenomenon of “persis-
tence” is such a quantity: it characterizes the statistics of
ﬁrst passage events in spatially extended non-equilibrium
systems [2–15]. Practically, persistence may be impor-
tant in determining what fraction of a system has reached
a threshold condition as a function of time; for example,
in certain chemical reactions or disinfectant procedures.
Consider a non-equilibrium scalar ﬁeld φ(x, t) ﬂuctuat-
ing in space and time according to some dynamics (e.g.,
a random array of interdiﬀusing spins). Persistence is
the probability p(t) that at a ﬁxed point in space the
quantity sgn[φ(x, t) − hφ(x, t)i] has not changed sign up
to time t.
It has been found that this probability de-
cays as a power law p(t) ∼ t−θ, where the persistence
exponent θ is generally nontrivial. This exponent de-
pends both on the system dimensionality and the preva-

lent dynamics, and is diﬃcult to determine analytically
due to the non-Markovian nature of the phenomena. Al-
though θ has been calculated – largely using numerical
techniques – for such systems as simple diﬀusion [3–5],
the Ising model [2,8,11], and the more generalized q-state
Potts model [2,12], few measurements of persistence have
been performed (see Table I). In particular, “breath ﬁg-
ures” [13], 2-D soap froth [14], and twisted nematic liquid
crystals [15] are the only systems for which experimental
results have been reported.

In this paper we present the ﬁrst measurement of per-
sistence in a system undergoing diﬀusion. Our experi-
ment is also the ﬁrst to observe persistence in one dimen-
sion (1-D). We employed a novel NMR technique to cre-
ate a “quasi-random” initial spatial variation in the spin
orientation of a sample of laser-polarized 129Xe gas. Sub-
sequent 1-D NMR imaging, repeated at diﬀerent times,
allowed us to monitor the temporal evolution of the en-
semble and observe persistence from the fraction of 1-D
regions in the sample that did not change their spin ori-
entation as a function of time. Using a simple theory
(the “independent interval approximation”) and numeri-
cal simulations, both Majumdar et al. [3] and Derrida et
al. [4] independently found that θ ≈ 0.121 for 1-D diﬀu-
sion. Newman and Toroczkai [5] found θ ≈ 0.125 in 1-D
using an analytic expression for the diﬀusion persistence
exponent. Our measurements are consistent with these
calculations.
Recently,

laser-polarized noble gas NMR has found
wide application in both the physical and biomedical sci-
ences. Examples include fundamental symmetry tests
[16], probing the structure of porous media [17], and
imaging of the lung gas space [18]. These varied investi-
gations, as well as the experiment reported here, exploit

FIG. 1. NMR pulse sequence used to encode a 1-D
“quasi-random” pattern on the average spin orientation of
laser-polarized 129Xe gas. Temporal evolution of the mag-
netization pattern is monitored with n repetitions of a 1-D
FLASH imaging routine. For example, with m = 8 encod-
ing RF pulse/gradient pairs, the encoding pulse angles αi =
[30◦, 35◦, 37◦, 41◦, 45◦, 50◦, 63.5◦, and 90◦] while the gradi-
ent amplitudes gi were chosen randomly. The imaging pulse
angle βj was ﬁxed at 8◦and the diﬀusion times τj were var-
ied from 2.4 ms up to ∼ 2 seconds. The encoding, crusher,
pre-image crusher, and imaging wind and rewind gradients
were pulsed for 1, 20, 3, 2, and 2.56 ms, respectively. The
maximum gradient available was 6.7 G/cm.

special features of laser-polarized noble gas: the large
nuclear spin polarization (∼ 10%) that can be achieved
with optical pumping techniques; the long-lived nuclear
spin polarization of the spin-1/2 noble gases 129Xe and
3He; and rapid gas-phase diﬀusion.

We performed laser-polarization of xenon gas using
spin-exchange optical pumping [19]. We ﬁlled a coated
cylindrical glass cell [20] (∼ 9 cm long, 2 cm I.D.) with
approximately 3 bar of xenon gas isotopically enriched
to 90% 129Xe, 400 torr of N2 gas, and a small amount
of Rb metal. We heated the sealed cell to ∼ 100◦C to
create a signiﬁcant Rb vapor using a resistively-heated
oven situated in the fringe ﬁeld (0.01 Tesla) of a high
ﬁeld magnet. Optical pumping on the Rb D1 line was
achieved with 15 W of circularly-polarized 795 nm light
(FWHM ∼ 3 nm) from a ﬁber-coupled laser diode ar-
ray. After 20 minutes the 129Xe gas was routinely nu-
clear spin-polarized to 1% by spin-exchange collisions
with the Rb vapor. We next cooled the cell to room
temperature in a water bath – eﬀectively condensing the
Rb vapor – and placed the cell inside a homemade RF
solenoid coil (2.5 cm diameter, 15 cm long, Q ∼ 900) cen-
tered in a 4.7 T horizontal bore magnet (GE Omega/CSI
spectrometer/imager) with 129Xe Larmor frequency =
55.345 MHz. To allow the gas temperature to reach equi-
librium, we left the cell in place for 20 minutes before
starting the persistence measurements. Under these con-
ditions the 129Xe polarization decay time constant (T1)
was in excess of 3 hours, with a 129Xe diﬀusion coeﬃcient
of 0.0198 cm2/s [21].

The NMR pulse sequence we used to observe per-
sistence in laser-polarized 129Xe gas diﬀusion is shown
schematically in Fig. 1. The initial portion of the pulse
sequence encodes a 1-D “quasi-random” pattern on the
average spin orientation of the laser-polarized 129Xe gas

sample. The pattern is quasi-random in that there must
be a minimum length scale to the induced variations in
the 129Xe magnetization (typically 500 µm) for there to
be suﬃcient NMR signal for useful imaging. Neverthe-
less, at longer length scales the induced pattern must
be random enough that persistence behavior can be ex-

calculations indicate that it is suﬃcient for the initial
condition correlator to decrease faster than |x − x′|−1 [3].
The quasi-random patterning pulse sequence employs
“cumulative k-space encoding.” Recall that one can de-
scribe an NMR experiment in terms of a reciprocal or k-
space formalism [22], where k is the wave number charac-
terizing a magnetization modulation or “grating” created
by RF and magnetic ﬁeld gradient pulses. One can rep-
resent a spatial magnetization distribution along a ﬁxed
axis by a combination of three basis functions: sin(kx)
for variations in the longitudinal magnetization Mz, and
e±ikx for positive and negative “helices” of transverse
magnetization Mx,y. RF pulses eﬀectively mix the com-
ponents of the magnetization (with amplitudes deter-
mined by the ﬂip angle) [23] and gradient pulses change
the k values of the transverse magnetization [22]. By
using m pairs of varying RF and random-strength gra-
dient pulses in rapid succession it is possible to create
a complex and near-random spatial magnetization dis-
tribution; i.e., a large number of gratings with diﬀerent
k-values and amplitudes are superposed. As Nelson and
coworkers showed [24], the maximum number Nmax(m)
of k values one can expect from m pairs of RF and gra-
dient pulses is given by

Nmax(m) =

4

(3m − 2m − 1).

(1)

We found that six to eight RF/gradient pulse pairs
(m = 6–8) were optimal for the desired quasi-random
1-D patterning of the 129Xe spin orientation. m < 6
resulted in a pattern that was not suﬃciently random,
while m > 8 signiﬁcantly reduced the signal-to-noise ra-
tio (SNR) of the NMR images. The requirement of m ≥ 6
is supported by numerical calculations in which we mod-
eled the NMR encoding sequence and simulated the sub-
sequent gas diﬀusion using a ﬁnite diﬀerence ﬁrst-order
forward Euler scheme [4,25]: we found persistence be-
havior (i.e., p(t) ∼ t−θ) only when m ≥ 6. Furthermore,
we acquired 512 (time domain) data points for each im-
age. The number of data points per image was limited
by the available NMR signal (i.e., the 129Xe polariza-
tion), the necessity of rapid data acquisition to avoid ex-
cessive diﬀusion during the imaging sequence itself, and
the maximum imaging gradient strength available. Since
there is a one-to-one mapping between the time domain
and k-space, we could discern at most 512 magnetiza-
tion gratings with diﬀerent k values. For m = 6, 7, 8,
Nmax(m) = 179, 543, and 1636, respectively. Hence, 7 or
more RF/gradient pulses maximally covered the avail-

FIG. 2. Typical set of 1-D images of 129Xe spin orienta-
tion from a single experimental run. For this example, 8
encoding RF pulse/gradient pairs were used to create an ini-
tial quasi-random pattern of 129Xe spin orientation on length
scales ≥ 500µm. 32 images were acquired at logarithmically
increasing times. Contours from every other image are over-
layed on the surface plot, which includes all 32 images.

able k-space and produced as random a 1-D spatial dis-
tribution of the 129Xe magnetization as was detectable
(given the constraints of ﬁnite sample length and min-
imum length scale of variations ∼ 500 µm). The fact
that our simulations (and data, see below) yield persis-
tence behavior for m = 6 indicates some robustness with
respect to initial conditions.

After the pattern encoding part of the NMR pulse se-
quence, a π/2 RF pulse “stores” the quasi-random mag-
netization distribution along the longitudinal (z) direc-
tion while a subsequent strong (crusher) gradient pulse
dephases any remaining transverse magnetization. The
quasi-random magnetization distribution then evolves
with time due to diﬀusion and is monitored by a series
of 1-D FLASH (Fast Low Angle SHot) NMR images [26]
(see Fig. 1). We used a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 31.5 cm
with 0.6 mm resolution, which thus divided the 9 cm cell
into about 150 discernible spatial regions. We typically
employed 8◦ excitation RF ﬂip angles and acquired 32
1-D images spaced logarithmically in time from ∼ 3 ms
to 5 s for a single experimental run. An example of the
images acquired in one such run are shown in Fig. 2. We
derived spin orientations (aligned or anti-aligned to the
main magnetic ﬁeld) from the phase information con-
tained in the time-domain NMR image data and spa-
tial positions from the frequency information [27]. Each
experimental run thus provided a record of the 129Xe
gas spin orientation as a function of position and time
proceeding from the initial quasi-random pattern to the
equilibrium condition of homogeneous (near-zero) polar-
ization.

To measure persistence, we noted the sign of the 129Xe
spin orientation in each spatial region (i.e., in each 1-D

as a function of time. We equated the probability p(t)
with the fraction of pixels that had not changed sign up
to time t. We chose t = 0 to coincide with the ﬁrst im-
age and assigned the time index for each image to be
the start time of the imaging RF pulse.
Images with
SNR < 40 were excluded from the data to minimize un-
certainty in pixel sign changes. We conducted about 30
experiments with image SNR > 40, each with a unique
set of randomly chosen encoding gradients {gi}. We em-
ployed two averaging schemes to combine the results from
diﬀerent experimental runs. In the ﬁrst method, we used
a linear least-squares ﬁt of log[p(t)] vs. log[t] for each run,
resulting in a distribution of power law exponents with
a weighted mean θ = 0.119 ± 0.048. With our numerical
simulations of cumulative k-space-encoded initial condi-
tions, we found that this averaging scheme results in a
gaussian distribution of exponents with a mean value θ ≈
0.12 in agreement with previous calculations for 1-D dif-
fusion [3–5] and our experimental results. In the second
averaging scheme, we combined the data from all exper-
imental runs; hence p(t) represented the fraction of total
pixels from all experiments that had not changed sign up
to time t. We found p(t) ∼ t−θ with θ = 0.118 ± 0.008
for 0.1 s < t < 1 s. Figure 3 shows a log-log plot of p(t)
vs. t when the data is averaged using this method.

The observed deviations from power law behavior for
t < 0.1 s and t > 1 s are explained by resolution and ﬁ-
nite size eﬀects, respectively. At short times persistence
is not observed because 129Xe atoms have not yet dif-
fused across a single spin orientation region δx ≈ 500µm.
The relevant diﬀusion time is (δx)2/(2DXe) ≈ 0.1 s. At
long times, the pattern of 129Xe spin orientation becomes

sion, thus curtailing the rate of sign-changing. Both the
short and long time deviations are also seen in Fig. 4,
where the average length L of spin orientation domains
from all experimental runs is plotted against time. For
0.1 s < t < 1 s, our data are in reasonable agreement
with the expected power law L ∼ t1/2 for diﬀusion. How-
ever, at short times L is near the limit to image resolu-
tion while at longer times L grows more rapidly as it
approaches the dimension of the sample cell.

In conclusion, we experimentally measured a persis-
tence exponent θ ≈ 0.12 for 1-D diﬀusion, consistent with
analytical and numerical studies. We performed the mea-
surement using a novel NMR scheme with laser-polarized
129Xe gas which allowed us to both encode a “quasi-
random” spatial pattern of spin orientation and monitor
its evolution over several seconds. We also observed the
eﬀect of ﬁnite sample size for long time diﬀusion. In fu-
ture work the experimental technique employed in this
study may allow measurements of persistence in 2 and
3-D diﬀusion, in heterogeneous systems (e.g., porous me-
dia) infused with noble gas, and in ‘patterns’ [28].

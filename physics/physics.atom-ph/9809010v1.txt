Abstract

We describe the classical two dimensinal nonlinear dynamics of cold atoms

in far-oﬀ-resonant donut beams. We show that there chaotic dynamics exists

for charge greater than unity , when the intensity of the beam is periodically

modulated. The two dimensional distributions of atoms in (x, y) plane for

charge two are simulated. We show that the atoms will acumulate on several

ring regions when the system enters to regime of global chaos.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Lagurre-Gaussian beam carries orbital angular momentum associated with helical

surface of constant phase has recently been the subject of considerable theoretical and exper-

imental study[1-7]. Many of these studies concern the transfer of orbital angular momentum

of the beam to small particals even atoms [1]. With the developement of laser cooling and

trapping of neutral atoms, various schemes to slow the atomic motion and increase the

atomic intensity have been proposed and some demonstarted.

In a far-oﬀ-resonant laser

beam it is possible to observe the spatial variation of the optical dipole force on slow atoms.

In this case the atom experiences an eﬀective mechanical potential propotional to the inten-

sity of the beam. Recently the Gaussian-Laguerre modes were used as as optical potential

to trap atoms [6].

The degree of nonlinearity of the potential is characterised by the ’charge’ of the donut.

The charge is an integer characterising the phase singularity of the beam on axis and which

also determines the variation of the intensity oﬀ axia in the transverse plane. In the case of

unit charge the intensity close to the axis varies quadratically with the radical distance in

the transverse plane. For a charge greated than inity the variation of intensity is a quartic,

or higher, power of the radical distance and thus the resulting motion near the beam axis is

nonlinear. In this case the frequancy of bound oscillatory motion near the axis depends on

the energy of the atom. As the energy increases, the frequency decreases, eventually falling

to zero quite quickly as the unstable ﬁxed point at the potential maximum is reached. It

is well known that if such a nonlinear system is driven by a periodic modulation of the

potential, chaotic dynamics can result [11]. In this paper we will consider the motion of cold

atoms in intensity modulated Gaussian-Lagurre (donut) beam and discuss the classical two

dimensional chaotic dynamics for charge l = 2.

III. CHAOTIC DYNAMICS OF COLD ATOMS IN FAR-OFF-RESONANT

DONUT BEAM

For cold atoms in far-oﬀ-resonant donut beam, the spontaneous emission can be ignored.

When the Rabi frequency is modulated and Ω0 is substitued by Ω0

1 + ǫ cos(ωt),, the

q

dynamics of the atom is chaotic . For the diﬀerent charge l, the potential is diﬀerent. The

larger the value of l, the wider the bottom of the potental. For l = 1, at the bottom of this

potental the motion of atom is harmonic and no chaotic dynamics for periodic modulated

potential can arise. Only if the atom has a larger kinetic energy so that the nonlinear parts

of the potential are expected, does the dynamics became chaotic. For l > 1, the dynamics

is nonlinear over the whole potential range and because the bottom is wider, it is easier to

control the amplitude of modulation.

For simplicity we discuss l = 2 case and the practical parameters for our numerical

examples are that for Rb atoms, the linewidth Γ/2π = 6MHz, mass M = 85mp, the beam

waist of laser w0 = 140µm, laser power W = 600mW/cm2 and the detuning ∆/2π = 6GHz.

We deﬁne dimensionless parameters (x, y) = (˜x, ˜y) = (x/w, y/w), ( ˜px, ˜py) = (px/PD, py/PD),

and one unstable ﬁxed point at the intensity maximum (r=1).

The chioce of modulation frequency ω depends on the frequency of unperturbed periodic

motion. For simplicity we assume y = 0 and py = 0, so the expression for H is simpliﬁed as

one dimensional Hamiltanian. The motion period for unperturbed Hamiltanian H0 is [9]

The graph of ω versus H0 and xM versus H0 can be seen in ﬁg.2. We can select the

modulation frequency ω to control the ﬁx points in periodic optical potential. Here we set

dimensionless parameter ω = 4.34, which corresponds to 3.67KHz.

We use the symplectic integrators [10], [11] to solve the equations of motion because the

Hamiltonian evolution preserves the Poisson bracket relation

x(t), px(t)

= 1

{

}

We plot the stroboscopic potrait of the system at times t = (2π/ω)s, where s is an integer

referred to as the strobe number. From ﬁgure 3,4,5 we can see that with the increase of ǫ,

the motion of atoms will appear chaos. But there are some stable regions. An initial wide

spectral distribution of atoms will result in some atoms trapped in these stable regions.

Laser cooling and trapping techniques have the ability to cool the atom to very low

velocities and trap them in very small region in momentum. Therefore the appropriate de-

scription of atomic dynamics is to use probability distribution on phase space (x, y, px, py).

Fig. 6 shows for optical potential when it is no modulation, atoms will accumulate

around the ﬁx pointx = y = 0 (ﬁg.3). when the modulation is added the atoms will diﬀuse

but will accumulate around several rings. With the increase of modulation amplitude, more

atoms accumulate around rings and less atoms around x = y = 0 (ﬁg.7,8). The variances

σpx and σpy are taken as 0.05 in computation, which corresponds to temperature Tx and Ty

approximately recoil temperature. If the variance is narrower rings become clearer.

IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In summary, we have shown that it has chaotic dynamics for mudulated far-oﬀ-detuning

donut beam. For atomic momenta px, py which have Gaussian distributions, atoms will be

trapped in rings when the optical potential is modulated. If at some moment the optical

potential is withdrawn, atoms will expand freely and will keep the shape of rings becasue

the momentua is symmetric in (x, y). Therefore the two dimensional atomic distribution in

(x, y) can be detected using TOF technique.

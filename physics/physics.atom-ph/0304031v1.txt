We report the ﬁrst observation of a non-dipole transition in an ultra-cold atomic vapor. We excite
the 3P-4P electric quadrupole (E2) transition in 23Na conﬁned in a Magneto-Optical Trap(MOT),
and demonstrate its application to high-resolution spectroscopy by making the ﬁrst measurement of
the hyperﬁne structure of the 4P1/2 level and extracting the magnetic dipole constant A = 30.6 ±
0.1 MHz. We use cw OODR (Optical-Optical Double Resonance) accompanied by photoinization
to probe the transition.

One of the frontiers in atomic physics is the detection of
the signature of a transition that is classiﬁed as “forbid-
den.” Forbidden-transition spectroscopy now plays a cen-
tral role in tests of fundamental symmetries of Nature. A
signiﬁcant example is the study of parity non-conserving
(PNC) interactions which provides one of the best mea-
surements of electro-weak symmetry breaking [1]. More
generally, forbidden transitions have been experimentally
studied [2] using a variety of techniques (such as elec-
tron impact and laser excitation), in a range of contexts
(from nebular spectra to cold-ion frequency standards ),
and in a number of atoms, ions, and molecules. In the
case of alkali atoms, the ﬁrst observation of a forbidden
transition dates back to the early days of quantum me-
chanics [3]. More recently, non-dipole eﬀects have been
explored in photoionization [4], n-wave mixing (NWM)
[5] and collision-induced absorption [6]. In the particu-
lar case of sodium, the 3S-3D E2 transition moment has
been measured using NWM [7] and the 3P-(5P, 4F) tran-
sitions were observed in OODR [8], both via pulsed laser
excitation.

Another frontier in atomic physics is laser cooling and
trapping of atoms. The availability of ensembles of cold
atoms has made accessible entirely new regimes of atomic
behavior ranging from atom-optical eﬀects [9] to the for-
mation of a Bose-Einstein condensate[10]. Moreover, a
cold vapor is a nearly ideal enabler for precision mea-
surement applications such as metrology [11] and high-
resolution spectroscopy [12]. In this Letter, we describe
the ﬁrst experimental observation of a forbidden atomic
transition in a laser-cooled vapor, conﬁned in a MOT.
Our experiment combines the Doppler-free nature of the
MOT, and its speciﬁc optical pumping properties, with
the high resolution aﬀorded by cw lasers and the near-
unity eﬃciency of ion detection. To illustrate the power
of this approach, we demonstrate the electric quadrupo-
lar nature of the 3P-4P transition and use it to analyze
the hyperﬁne structure of the 4P1/2 level. Measurements
of hyperﬁne splittings are of interest because they are
sensitive to electronic correlations and relativistic eﬀects,
providing a benchmark for testing the accuracy of many-

body atomic structure calculations [13].

Our initial observations were made with a standard
MOT [12] (Fig.1) operating on the D2 transition. We
refer to this as the D2MOT. Atoms held in the trap were
probed with light tunable around 750 nm generated using
an Ar+- pumped Ti:Sa ring laser. While the trapping
→3P3/2) transition,
light excited atoms on the D2 (3S1/2
the probe laser excited the 3P-4P E2 transition. Atoms
populating the resulting doubly excited state were then
ionized to S and D states in the continuum by either a
trap or a probe photon. The resulting Na+ ions were
detected using a channel electron multiplier (CEM).

Our experiments were typically carried out using probe
laser powers ∼ 100 mW focused down to a ∼ 100
µm diameter spot yielding an excitation intensity of
∼ 106mW/cm2 (the MOT diameter is ∼ 300 µm). The
intensity ISat for saturating the E2 transition can be es-

timated in the semi-classical approximation by equating
the 3P-4P quadrupole Rabi frequency ( ΩQ ∼ QkEo/¯h,
where Q is the quadrupole moment of the transition, and
k and Eo are the wavevector and electric ﬁeld amplitude
of the 750 nm light ) with the sum of the linewidths of
the 3P and 4P levels ( γD ), which are set by dipole (E1)
emission to the 3S ground state. We ﬁnd

where ηo = 377 Ω is the impedance of free space. With
k=2π/(750 nm), γD ∼ 15 MHz [14] and Q ∼ 30 in atomic
units [15] we arrive at ISat ∼ 106 mW/cm2, indicating
that the E2 transition is adequately saturated in our ex-
periment. We were actually able to observe clearly re-
solved spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios down to
∼ 20 mW of Ti:Sa power. It is important to note that sat-
uration intensities comparable to those quoted here will
also apply to transition moments to higher P states in
Na [15] as well as in other alkalis [16]. This implies that
our excitation techniques can be readily generalized to
other levels and other species. Moreover, the low excita-
tion power required means that similar E2 studies can be
carried out even using inexpensive, low-power cw-diode
lasers familiar to most cooling and trapping laboratories.
Our subsequent experiments were carried out us-
ing a MOT (Fig.
1), operating on both the D1
and D2 transitions. We refer to this trap as the
D1D2MOT. In the D1D2MOT, the trapping light was
produced by one dye laser detuned 16 MHz below
the 3S1/2(F=2)→3P3/2(F′=3) D2 transition and locked
using saturation spectroscopy. The repumping light
was produced by a second dye laser that was intense
enough to be resonant with both the 192 MHz split
3S1/2(F=1)→3P1/2(F′=1, 2) D1 transitions via power-
broadening. The power broadening eliminated the need
to stabilize the repumping laser against long-term drift.
Anti-Helmholtz coils produced a 20 G/cm magnetic ﬁeld
gradient and the background pressure was ∼ 10−9 Torr.
From ﬂuorescence measurements we estimated the num-
ber of atoms in the trap to be ∼ 106 at densities ∼ 109
cm−3.

We ﬁnd that the D1D2MOT is particularly useful
for our experiments for several reasons. First, in the
D2MOT, the presence of the repumping light tuned to
the 3P3/2 excited state manifold complicates the spec-
trum - the ion production channels involve two intense
laser ﬁelds interacting with four closely spaced hyper-
ﬁne levels. By moving the repumping frequency to the
3P1/2 manifold we isolate the 3P3/2(F=3)→4P1/2(F′=1,
2) spectrum and remove any eﬀects associated with the
repumper intensity. Second, in order to control power-
broadening in our spectrum and also to acquire data at
detunings both above and below the 3P3/2(F=3) level, we
switched the trapping light oﬀ, and used a weak tunable
pump to excite the 3S-3P transition. However, to prevent

2

optical pumping into the 3S1/2(F=1) state from interfer-
ing with our measurement it was necessary to leave the
repumper on, a conﬁguration made possible by our two-
laser scheme. Finally, the D1D2MOT naturally provides
a steady-state population in the 3P1/2 state, allowing us
to investigate all possible transitions between the 3PJ
and 4PJ ′ ﬁne structure levels, as discussed below.

Having observed the peaks in the ion spectrum associ-
ated with the hyperﬁne structure of the 4P1/2 level, we
carried out several studies to conﬁrm that excitation was
due to an E2 process. To begin with, we noted that (1)
the absence of a J=1/2→J′=1/2 peak in the 3PJ →4PJ ′
spectrum is a direct consequence of the ∆J selection rules
assuming an E2 process in an alkali atom [17] and (2) the
intensity scale agreement described in Eq.(1) above de-
pends crucially on E2 excitation. We then eliminated
the only two possible processes that could lead to ex-
citation in absence of an E2 process: Stark-mixing and
collisional coupling. Consider ﬁrst Stark-mixing. In our
setup, the only source of an electric ﬁeld large enough
(∼kV/cm) to produce Stark-mixing is the CEM and as-
sociated ion collection optics. We switched oﬀ the CEM
and still observed depletion of the MOT ﬂuorescence at
resonant Ti:Sa frequencies. While the presence of Stark-
mixing implies a quadratic dependence of the ion-count
on the electric ﬁeld, no change was observed as the ion-
detection-optic ﬁelds were varied by more than a factor
of four. To address the possibility of collisional eﬀects,
we repeated our measurements using the D2MOT in two
distinct conﬁgurations that produce atom clouds diﬀering
in density by an order of magnitude. The ﬁrst conﬁgu-
ration, in which the trapping light was tuned below the
3P3/2(F=3) level, produced higher densities than the sec-
ond conﬁguration in which the trapping light was tuned
below the 3P3/2(F=2) level. In the presence of collisional
excitation, which scales as density squared, the ion count
rate is expected to change by approximately two orders
of magnitude[18]. Instead we observed an ion count rate
that increased only as the number of atoms in the inter-
action volume deﬁned by the probe laser, or speciﬁcally,
with a linear dependence on atomic density.

The quantitative measurement of the 4P1/2 hyperﬁne
structure was made in the following manner (Fig. 1).
The D1D2MOT trapping laser was passed through an
acousto-optic modulator (AOMtrap) and the ﬁrst order
beam provided the trapping light. Using the modula-
tor, the trapping light was switched on and oﬀ every
100µs with a 50% duty cycle, which allowed us to main-
tain a trapped atom number of ∼ 105. A weak (∼ 1
µW/cm2) pump was introduced into the trap by select-
ing a small portion of light from the same laser before it
passed through AOMtrap and sending it through a sep-
arate AOM whose ﬁrst order output was tunable from
16MHz below the 3P3/2(F=3) level to 64MHz above.
This pump ﬁeld was not switched, but was instead left
on continuously. Further, the pump beam was retro-

structure as a function of Ti:Sa frequency, acquired using the

reﬂected to prevent the MOT from being depleted due to
mechanical pushing eﬀects, particularly when the pump
light was tuned near atomic resonance.
In all experi-
ments, repumping light was applied continuously.

Probe light from the Ti:Sa was also sent through a
modulator (AOMT i:Sa) aligned such that the zeroth and
ﬁrst order beams had approximately equal power. The
ﬁrst order was shifted up in frequency relative to the ze-
roth order by 120.0045 ± 0.0003 MHz as measured on a
precise frequency counter. Both orders were then sepa-
rately focused on the atoms in the MOT and each beam
contributed a set of peaks to our spectrum as the Ti:Sa
frequency was varied (Fig. 2). The oﬀset supplied by
AOMT i:Sa allowed us to calibrate our measurement and
to check the slope and linearity of the Ti:Sa frequency
sweep. We found the sweep was linear but the nominal
value of the slope required a 3% correction. This pro-
cedure eliminated any need to externally calibrate the
Ti:Sa laser frequency.

Using this set-up, we obtained ionization spectra for
diﬀerent detunings of the pump. Each spectrum was ﬁt
to the sum of four Lorentzians and a value of the hy-
perﬁne splitting was extracted from each ﬁt. Forty-eight
measurements were ﬁt assuming a normal distribution.
We thereby determined a mean value and standard error
for the magnetic dipole constant A(4P1/2)= 30.6 ± 0.1
MHz, which is half of the hyperﬁne splitting. The theo-
retical prediction is 30.7 MHz [19], in excellent agreement
with our data.

When we acquire spectra with the trapping light left
on, we observe Autler-Townes doublets which exhibit de-
pendence on the Rabi frequency and detuning of the

identify these peaks as arising from the interaction of
the intense trapping light with the 3P3/2(F=3)level. In
the case of the D2MOT (Fig. 3c)the same interaction

gives rise to all the peaks except for the rightmost which
is due to the repumping light and which corresponds to
the 3P3/2(F=2)→4P1/2(F′= 2) transition. This type of
spectra reveals both the eﬀective Rabi frequency seen by
the atoms and the population distribution in the excited-
state of the 3P3/2 trapping manifold. The ability to de-
tect these populations is of interest, for example, in elu-
cidating the role of atomic hyperﬁne structure in excited-
state cold collisions in MOTs [20]. In fact, E2 transitions
are especially well-suited for this type of measurement
for two reasons. First, the ∆F=0, ±1, ±2 selection rules
allow for any single hyperﬁne level in any higher P1/2
state to probe the entire trapping manifold. More gen-
erally, the weakness of E2 transitions makes them nar-
rower probes than those that rely on dipole transitions
from other atomic states. It is also interesting to note
that, in the context of a MOT where exchange of mo-
mentum with light is important, the E2 transition is the
lowest electric multipolar process in which exchange of
orbital angular momentum between light beams and in-
ternal (as opposed to center-of-mass) atomic motion can
be observed [21].

Having demonstrated that E2 excitation of an atomic
transition can be observed using standard cw lasers in
combination with a simple robust laser cooling appara-
tus, we now turn to extensions and limitations of our
work. A natural ﬁrst step is to consider the linewidths
extracted from spectra such as in (Fig. 2). We observe
that the magnitudes of these linewidths are ∼10 MHz.
Although the values conﬁrm that the Na atoms are at or
below the Doppler temperature (∼ 240µK) the observed
linewidth is convolved with the width of the intermedi-
ate 3P3/2(F=3) state, which is known to be ∼10 MHz.
For more accurate linewidth measurements, a detuning
of the pump ﬁeld further to the blue of the 3P3/2(F=3)
level can be used because in this limit the spectrum yields

the natural linewidth of the 4P state being ionized. An
alternative approach would be to detect the 330 nm ﬂu-
orescence from the dipolar (E1) decay of the 4P level to
the 3S ground state.

If we now consider the peak amplitudes in our spectra
we ﬁnd our experiment provides a natural way to mea-
sure the strength of the E2 interaction. From the relative
heights of the 4P1/2 peaks we estimated the ratio of the
quadrupole transition matrix elements for the F= 1 and 2
states to be 1. Similarly, we compared the ion yield from
the 3S→3P→4P→continuum transition to that from the
dipole-allowed process ( with the probe laser at 820nm )
3S→3P→3D→continuum. The ratio of ion counts from
the two processes essentially yields the value of the E2
transition matrix element in terms of the known 3P→3D
matrix element [8].Our experimental values agree with
the theoretical value used to estimate Eq.(1) within a
factor of 5 uncertainty. Better control over laser parame-
ters can provide amplitude data of quality high enough to
be compared to theory, and to be of use, for example, in
PNC experiments. We point out that other methods for
measuring forbidden transition matrix elements, such as
NWM [7] and polarization spectroscopy [22] have so far
been implemented using pulsed lasers. The application
of cw techniques demonstrated by us would make these
methods more accurate and increase their resolution en-
abling them to account for atomic hyperﬁne structure.

The observation of a forbidden process in a physical
system points to a lowering of symmetry, which in turn
implies the presence of new physics. For example, our
observations open up the possibility of using a MOT to
observe second order (χ(2)) nonlinear processes which are
not allowed in the dipole approximation in centrosym-
metric media such as alkali vapors. Also interesting
would be the observation of radiative behavior of cold
atoms close to dielectric surfaces, a situation in which the
intensity of quadrupole transitions has been predicted to
become comparable to that of dipole transitions [23].The
achievement of single-atom MOTs [24] implies the pos-
sibility of PNC measurements via E1-E2 interference as
proposed for Ba+ [25].

In conclusion, we report the ﬁrst observation of a for-
bidden transition in a cold atomic vapor formed in a
MOT. We use the resulting excitation process in com-
bination with OODR ionization spectroscopy to mea-
sure the magnetic dipole constant of the 4P1/2 level of
sodium and ﬁnd A = 30.6 ±0.1 MHz.
In addition to
demonstrating the application to high-resolution atomic
spectroscopy, we describe how our technique can used to
perform multiphoton ionization and Autler-Townes spec-
troscopy and to explore the role of hyperﬁne structure in
alkali MOTs.

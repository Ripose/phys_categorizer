The eﬀect of microwave radiation on the resonance ﬂuorescence of a cloud of cold 85Rb atoms in
a magnetooptical trap is studied. The radiation frequency was tuned near the hyperﬁne splitting
frequency of rubidium atoms in the 5S ground state. The microwave ﬁeld induced magnetic dipole
transitions between the magnetic sublevels of the 5S(F=2) and 5S(F=3) states, resulting in a change
in the ﬂuorescence signal. The resonance ﬂuorescence spectra were recorded by tuning the microwave
radiation frequency. The observed spectra were found to be substantially dependent on the transition
under study and the frequency of a repump laser used in the cooling scheme.

The method of opticalradiofrequency double resonance
provides the basis for atomic frequency standards [1]. Mi-
crowave radiation, resonant with transitions between the
hyperﬁne levels of alkali metal atoms (for example, Rb
and Cs), induces magnetic dipole transitions, resulting in
turn in a change in a resonance ﬂuorescence or absorp-
tion signal at optical transitions from the ground state.
In the ﬁrst experiments, the eﬀect of microwave ﬁelds
on absorption and polarization of light from resonance
lamps has been studied [2].

Before the advent of magnetooptical traps for laser
cooling and capture of atoms [3], thermal atomic gases
with a large Doppler broadening have been mainly stud-
ied. The ﬁrst microwave spectroscopic experiments with
cooled atoms have been performed in a magnetic trap
with Na atoms [4]. The ﬂuorescence spectrum of Na
atoms captured in a strong magnetic ﬁeld (∼2300 G)
was studied in the presence of a probe laser ﬁeld and
probing microwave radiation. However, a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld caused the broadening of resonances up to 200
MHz, which substantially exceeds the natural width of
optical transitions.

Later [5], a microwave ﬁeld was used to excite transi-
tions between the hyperﬁne levels of the ground state of
cesium atoms cooled in the optical molasses at the point
of intersection of three standing light waves. The ﬂuo-
rescence signal from atoms, which have been preliminary
cooled in the molasses, was studied after the shutdown
of cooling laser beams. This allowed the observation of
optically unperturbed microwave resonances of width as
small as a few tens of hertz. The intensity of microwave
radiation in these experiments did not exceed a few tens
of nW/cm2.

These studies have been further developed in experi-
ments with socalled ”atomic fountains” (see, for example,
[6]). Narrowing of the atomicstandard lines was achieved
by the Ramsey fringes method during the roundtrip tran-
sit of cooled slow atoms in a microwave resonator [7]. In
addition, a microwave ﬁeld was used in some papers in-

stead of a repump laser to produce an opticalmicrowave
magnetooptical trap [8].

The aim of the microwave spectroscopy of cooled atoms
is, as a rule, the observation of ultranarrow resonances
and the development of a precision atomic clock based on
microwave transitions. However, microwave spectroscopy
can be also used to study processes occurring in a cloud
of cold atoms. For example, recently microwave spectro-
scopic experiments were performed with atoms loaded
from a magnetooptical trap to an optical trap with a
large frequency detuning [9]. The authors of paper [9]
also observed narrow microwave resonances (∼500 Hz
and narrower) by switching oﬀ coiling lasers during mea-
surements.

The aim of this work was to study the eﬀect of a mi-
crowave ﬁeld on a resonance ﬂuorescence signal in a stan-
dard magnetooptical trap with Rb atoms and to estimate
the possibility of using this eﬀect for diagnostics of a
cloud of cold atoms.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The Rb atoms were cooled and captured in a magne-
tooptical trap using a laser setup containing two 780nm
externalresonator semiconductor lasers and a frequency-
locking system based on saturated absorption in optical
cells with Rb atoms [10, 11].

Laser cooling was performed using a standard optical
scheme consisting of three pairs of orthogonally polarized
laser beams (σ+, σ-) crossing at the center of a quartz
cell (Fig. 1), which was evacuated by ion pumps down
to a pressure of < 1·10−8 Torr. The source of Rb atoms
was an ampoule containing a natural mixture of rubidium
isotopes at room temperature.

The magneticﬁeld gradient in the trap (0÷15 G/cm)
was produced by a pair of antiHelmholtz coils. Resid-
ual magnetic ﬁelds were compensated with the help of
additional Helmholtz coils. The possibility of compen-

sation for residual magnetic ﬁelds and the accuracy of
alignment of the laser beams were provided by using two
CCD cameras placed from both sides of the cell.

The resonance ﬂuorescence signal was detected with a
calibrated twoelement photodiode equipped by a TV ob-
jective and a diﬀerential ampliﬁer. The cloud image was
projected by the objective on one of the elements of the
photodiode, the second element being used to subtract
laser radiation scattered from the cell walls.

The Rb atoms were captured in the trap by locking
the cooling laser frequency either to the slope of the sat-
urated absorption (Fig. 2b) 5S1/2(F=3)→ 5P3/2(F=4)
transition peak of 85Rb with the red 1÷3Γ detuning from
the resonance center (Fig. 2a) (Γ=6 MHz is the natu-
ral width of the D2 line of Rb) or to the slope of the

the socalled selfstabilized magnetooptical trap was real-
ized [12]. As a result, the ﬂuorescence signal had a more
stable constant component corresponding to the equilib-
rium population of the trap.

The repump laser was tuned to the slope of the sat-
urated absorption 5S1/2(F=2)→ 5P3/2(F=2 or 3) tran-
sition peak with the red 0÷3Γ detuning (Fig. 2a) and
was locked to the resonance using the Pound-Drever fre-
quency modulation method [13, 14].

The output power of lasers was ∼6 mW. Laser beams
were expanded in front of the cell with the help of tele-
scopes up to a diameter of 7÷8 mm. The intensity of
each of the laser beams incident on the cell was 2.6
mW/cm2, while the calculated saturation intensity was
1.65 mW/cm2. Figure 2c illustrates the measured de-
pendence of the number of trapped atoms on the cooling
laser frequency, the repump laser frequency being locked
to the resonance at the 5S1/2(F=2)→5P3/2(F=2) tran-
sition. Figure 2d shows the dependence of the number

of trapped atoms on the total power of the repump laser
in the trap when the cooling laser was detuned by δ=9
MHz. It is seen that the saturation of trap population
occurs even at 0.1 mW.

We obtained in the trap a cloud of cold atoms 0.6÷2
mm in diameter, containing ≤2×107 atoms, which corre-
sponds to an atomic density ≤2×1010 cm−3. The cloud
temperature equal to ∼50µK was measured by the dy-
namics of a decrease in the number of atoms after a short
(5÷200 ms) switching oﬀ of the magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent. The trap population decreased by a factor of e for
the time t∼30 ms. This means that a greater part of
Rb atoms escaped from the region of interaction with
laser radiation for the time 30 ms by ﬂying the dis-
tance L=A/2≈3.5 mm (A is the beam aperture). In the
Maxwell velocity distribution approximation, the expres-
sion for the average temperature of atoms can be written
in the form [4]:

hT i =

M hvi2
3kB

,

(1)

where hvi= L/t is the average velocity of atoms, kB is
the Boltzmann constant, and M is the atom mass; and
the temperature estimated from (1) is 50 µ.

In microwave spectroscopic experiments, we used a fre-
quency synthesizer based on the ﬁrst heterodyne of a
S4-60 spectrum analyzer with a 20-dBm, 3-GHz (±300
MHz) power ampliﬁer (Fig. 1). The width of the het-
erodyne line did not exceed 10 kHz. The frequency was
continuously tuned with the help of a CAMAC digital-
toanalog converter.

A weak change in the resonance ﬂuorescence caused
by magnetic dipole transitions in rubidium atoms was
investigated by the lockin detection technique. For this

purpose, the amplitude of microwave radiation was mod-
ulated by a SSW-508 microwave switch (Sirenza). The
output microwave radiation was fed from the switch to a
wire coil of diameter 4 cm, which was matched with the
help of a strip halfwave transformer and was located at
a distance of 3 cm from the trap center. Control pulses
at the frequency 1.5 kHz from a pulse generator were
applied to the microwave switch.

The ﬂuorescence signal from the photodetector was fed
to a phasesensitive ampliﬁer. The output signal of the
generator controlling the switch was used as the refer-
ence frequency signal. As a result, the output signal of
the ampliﬁer was proportional to a change in the ﬂuo-
rescence intensity caused by microwave radiation. This
signal, along with a constant ﬂuorescence from the trap,
was recorded as a function of the microwave generator
frequency.

We have failed in our ﬁrst experiments to achieve the
reproducibility of microwave spectra when the cooling
laser frequency was locked to the saturated absorption
resonances. For this reason, we used frequency locking
over ﬂuorescence. Microwave radiation modulated the
ﬂuorescence signal at 1.5 kHz. The cutoﬀ frequency of
the cooling laser locking system was selected to be on the
order of few hundred of hertz to avoid the suppression of
the useful signal.

To enhance the useful signal, the repump laser power
was reduced to 90 µW for each of the beams in the trap.
In addition, to narrow the microwave resonances in mi-
crowave experiments, we used the minimal gradient of

the magnetic ﬁeld in the trap (≈5G/cm) at which a suf-
ﬁcient number of atoms is still captured by the trap.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 3a shows the dependence of the trap popula-
tion on the microwave frequency for the case when the
repump laser was detuned to the red with respect to
the maximum of the 5S1/2(F=2)→5P3/2(F=2) transi-
tion. The microwave spectrum was obtained after averag-
ing over ten measurements. Noise and ﬂuctuations were
mainly caused by the photodetector noise. The position
of the frequency 3035.732 MHz of the unperturbed mi-
crowave resonance for the magnetic dipole 5S1/2 (F=2)↔
5S1/2(F=3) transition in 85Rb atoms is indicated by the
dashed straight line. One can see that the ﬂuorescence
signal from the trap exhibits a dip near this frequency.
The width of the microwave resonance was almost the
same in diﬀerent experiments and was ∼500 kHz.

The observed resonance is caused by the transfer
of cold 85Rb atoms from the 5S1/2 (F=3) state to
the 5S1/2 (F=2) state due to magnetic dipole transi-
tions. In the case of exact tuning of the microwave fre-
quency, the ﬂuorescence intensity of the trap at the cool-
ing 5S1/2(F=3)→5P3/2(F=4) transition decreases be-
cause the number of atoms in the 5S1/2(F=3) state
decreases. The absence of the shift of the microwave
resonance suggests that either the ﬂuorescence signal
is detected from the central part of a cloud of cooled

atoms, where the magnetic ﬁeld is weak and the Zee-
man shift of levels is negligible, or magnetic dipole transi-
tions are excited between the central Zeeman components
5S1/2(F=2,|mF |=0) and 5S1/2(F=3,|mF |=0), which are
not shifted. The latter assumption is unlikely because the
magnetic moments of cold atoms have no deﬁnite orien-
tation with respect to any arbitrary quantization axis in
the trap, while the polarization of microwave radiation
has not been especially selected. Therefore, the most
probable reason for the absence of the shift of the mi-
crowave resonance is the detection of variations in the
ﬂuorescence intensity from the central part of the cloud.
Such a behavior is observed only when the repump laser
is tuned to the 5S1/2(F=2)→5P3/2(F=2) transition, at
which a part of atoms at the trap center can be trans-
ferred to the dark states, which do not interact with laser
radiation [15].

The decrease in the ﬂuorescence intensity is most likely
explained by the fact that microwave radiation transfers
a part of atoms from the 5S1/2(F=3) state to the local
dark states, which are produced at the 5S1/2(F=2) level
by the repump laser. Because atoms in these states are
not excited by the pump laser, they do not also interact
with the radiation of the cooling laser, which results in
the reduction of the ﬂuorescence signal.

By analyzing the width of the observed resonance,
note that the 5S1/2 (F=3) sublevel should experience the
shift, broadening, and splitting under the action of ra-
diation from the cooling laser due to the Autler-Townes
eﬀect [16]. The level splitting and shift are determined
by the position of the quasienergy levels [17]:

ω± = δ/2 ± pδ2/4 + Ω2/4,

(2)

where δ is the detuning from the optical resonance and
Ω is the Rabi frequency. Note that the detuning and Rabi

frequency in our experiment (in the case of saturation)
are of the same order of magnitude as Γ. The magnet-
icﬁeld gradient determines the variation of detunings on
the cloud dimensions, therefore a microwave resonance
should broaden up to a few megahertz. This conclusion
is conﬁrmed by recent paper [18] in which the Autler-
Townes eﬀect was studied on optical transitions in cold
Rb atoms and level shifts and splittings were observed.
However, the resonance width ≈400 kHz observed in
our experiments is noticeably smaller than the above
value and is virtually independent of the detuning of the
cooling laser. This is probably explained by the fact that
microwave radiation has induced transitions to the dark
states, which do not interact with radiation. In this case,
the resonance width was determined only by the inhomo-
geneity of the magnetic ﬁeld at the trap center, where the
dark states for degenerate levels can appear. This con-
clusion requires further experiments to study the features
of the dark states produced at the trap center when the
repump laser operates at the 5S1/2(F=2)→5P3/2(F=2)
transition.

The resonance amplitude in Fig. 3a in diﬀerent ex-
periments was (3÷9)·103 atoms. Its maximum value was
determined by the strength of the magnetic component
of the microwave ﬁeld. At the same time, it was found
that a rather large variation in the amplitude was caused
by weak ﬂuctuations in the detunings of laser frequencies
from opticaltransition frequencies. The maximum ampli-
tude was achieved when these detunings were identical,
the central frequency of the resonance being invariable.
Quite a diﬀerent picture was observed when the re-
pump laser was tuned to the 5S1/2(F=2)→5P3/2(F=3)
transition, for which the dark states are absent (Fig.
3b). The spectrum exhibits two peaks (∓∆f ), which
are symmetrically split with respect to the center of the
5S1/2(F=2)↔5S1/2(F=3) transition. It was assumed ﬁrst

that these peaks appear due to the Autler-Townes eﬀect
for the 5S1/2(F=3) level in the ﬁeld of the cooling laser
because the sifts of resonances depended on the detuning
of the cooling laser at the 5S1/2(F=3)→5P3/2(F=4) tran-
sition. However, one can see from Eq. (2) that the shifts
of the quasienergy levels should be diﬀerent in the case of
the red detuning of the laser. Therefore, the shifts of the
resonances in Fig. 3b should be also diﬀerent, whereas
we observe the symmetric shifts and splitting.

The observed eﬀect can be also interpreted in a dif-
ferent way. Because the frequencies of microwave reso-
nances are shifted with respect to the central frequency,
they are mainly caused by atoms located in the gradient
magnetic ﬁeld at the periphery of a cold cloud. As the red
detuning of the cooling laser from the resonance with the
5S1/2(F=3)→5P3/2(F=4) transition decreases, the tem-
perature of atoms increases, resulting in an increase in
the cloud size. Therefore, the shifts of microwave reso-
nances increase due to the increase in the Zeeman split-
ting at the cloud periphery. The increase in the ﬂuores-
cence signal in the region of resonances in Fig. 3b com-
pared to its decrease in Fig. 3a is caused by the increase
in the eﬃciency of the repump laser at the cloud periph-
ery when microwave radiation is tuned to the resonance.
The presence of two resonances in Fig. 3b suggests that
magnetic dipole transitions are excited between the ex-
treme Zeeman components of the 5S1/2(F=2,|mF |=±2)
and 5S1/2(F=3,|mF |=±3) levels having the largest res-
onance shifts (dνZeeman/dB≈ 2.56 MHz/G). The fre-
quency shifts shown in Fig. 4 correspond to the trap
radius from 1 to 1.8 mm, in accordance with analysis of
the TV image of the trap.

Although the main features of the spectra presented
above were reproducible in diﬀerent experiments, note
that the signal noise and ﬂuctuations were rather large.
The signaltonoise ratio was not substantially improved

5

even in the case of lockin detection. This is related to
a rather long loading time of the trap (∼1 s), resulting
in the suppression of the alternate component of the ﬂu-
orescence signal. For this reason, the amplitude of res-
onances in our experiments did not exceed 0.01 of the
total ﬂuorescence intensity level.

At the same time, our experiments showed that the mi-
crowave spectroscopy of cold atoms allows one to study
ﬂuorescence signals from diﬀerent regions of a cloud of
cold atoms. The switching to the detection of one or an-
other region of the cloud is achieved by a proper choice of
one of the transitions for the repump laser. For example,
when the J→J transition is used, a change in ﬂuorescence
from the central part of the cloud is detected, while in
the case of the J→J+1 transitions, ﬂuorescence from the
cloud periphery is analyzed. This is directly related to
the presence of the ”dark states” for the J→J transitions
and their absence for the J→J+1 transitions, as was al-
ready mentioned in [15]. These features can be used for
the development of new methods for diagnostics of cold
atoms.

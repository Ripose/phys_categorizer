Abstrat. We onsider a quantum state interating with a short intense linearly

polarized laser pulse. Using the two-dimensional time representation and Floquet

piture we establish a straightforward onnetion between the laser arrier-envelope

phase (CEP) and the wave funtion. This onnetion is revealed as a unitary

transformation in the spae of Floquet omponents. It allows any CEP e(cid:27)et to be

interpreted as an interferene between the omponents and to put limits on using the

CEP in oherent ontrol. A 2-level system is used to illustrate the theory. On this

example we demonstrate strong intensity sensitivity of the CEP e(cid:27)ets and predit an

e(cid:27)et for pulses muh longer than the osillation period of the arrier.

1. Introdution

Progress in manipulating ultrashort intense laser pulses has made possible studying

laser-matter interations in qualitatively new regimes. For instane, very short pulses

having only a few osillations of the laser (cid:28)eld an be produed [1, 2℄. In ontrast to the

more onventional ase, when a laser pulse is muh longer than the arrier period,

the arrier phase of the pulse with respet to the envelope maximum an beome

an important parameter for short pulses. This phase is alled the arrier-envelope

(CE) phase (CEP). It has been demonstrated experimentally, that the CE phase an

signi(cid:28)antly in(cid:29)uene ionization of Kr atoms by infrared laser pulses [1℄. Reently,

similar experiments were performed with Rydberg states of Rb atoms ionized by a few-

yle 25 MHz pulse [3℄, and the spatial distribution of the ionized eletrons has shown

sensitivity to the CEP. Even potentially stronger e(cid:27)ets were predited theoretially

for dissoiation of the HD

in the laser (cid:28)eld [4℄ and experiments are being performed.

+

The sensitivity of high harmoni generation (HHG) on the laser CEP is also known

[2℄. Moleular isomerisation in short intense laser pulses also provides an interesting

example where CEP e(cid:27)ets are important [5℄.

However, the CEP e(cid:27)ets are, probably, not fully understood theoretially. Only a

few models that go beyond the qualitative piture have been disussed. An interesting

interpretation of the CEP e(cid:27)ets in ionization as a double-slit interferene in the time

domain was proposed by F.Linder et al.

[6℄. This interpretation, however, does not

help to desribe results for high energy eletrons, or, more generally, to desribe the

Unitary theory of laser Carrier-Envelope Phase e(cid:27)ets

2

dependene of the CEP e(cid:27)ets on the (cid:28)nal state energy. The goal of this paper is to

propose a simple and physially signi(cid:28)ant interpretation for the in(cid:29)uene of the CE

phase on the interating wave funtion. We propose a piture revealing a simple but

exat relationship between the laser phase and the state.

We use the 2D time (or (t, t′)) formalism [7℄ together with a Floquet representation

of the interation. This approah allows a model-free separation of di(cid:27)erent time sales

present in a short laser pulse. We shall see how the CEP an be eliminated from the

equations by a simple unitary transformation. This transformation allows reovery of

the CEP dependene of a (cid:28)nal state from the wave funtion omponents for one CE

phase only.

We illustrate our result by demonstrating how the state of a two-level system (a

qubit) an be ontrolled by a short pulse, revealing the mehanisms of CEP in(cid:29)uene

on the state of the system. We demonstrate and explain dependene of the CEP e(cid:27)et

magnitude on the maximal (cid:28)eld of the pulse and the pulse duration. It is shown that

CEP e(cid:27)ets an be observed even for pulses that are muh longer than one osillation

period of the arrier.

2. Theory

We base our approah on investigating the time-dependent Shrödinger equation

i

∂
∂t

Ψ = [H0 + V (t)]Ψ .

Here Ψ is the wave funtion, H0 is the Hamiltonian of the system without laser (cid:28)eld, and
V (t) stands for the laser-matter interation potential. We shall onsider laser-matter

interations of the following form

V (t) =

E(t)

d cos(ωt + ϕ) .

−

·

Here E(t) is the envelope of the laser pulse (cid:28)eld, d is the dipole interation operator,
ω is the laser arrier frequeny and ϕ is the arrier-envelope phase. The latter an be

a very important parameter espeially for su(cid:30)iently short pulses, and it is the main

(1)

(2)

parameter studied in this work.

In what follows, we give a brief desription of the 2D time formalism [7℄ and

introdue a two-dimensional time representation for a system in a pulsed laser (cid:28)eld.

We shall demonstrate how this representation allows eliminating of the CEP ϕ

from the evolution equation and onstrution of a CEP-independent solution. The

CEP dependent solution of the initial equation (2) an be reovered from the CEP-

independent solution with a unitary transform.

2.1. The 2D time formalism for a system in a periodi external (cid:28)eld

The formalism of two-dimensional time is very useful to treat time-dependent systems

that show both periodi and non-periodi behavior, suh as atoms and moleules in a

(cid:28)eld of a laser pulse. One of the advantages of this formalism is that it allows separation

Unitary theory of laser Carrier-Envelope Phase e(cid:27)ets

3

of periodi and non-periodi dynamis without resorting to adiabati expansions that

might onverge slowly for nonadiabati systems.

In the 2D-time representation one introdues a seond time s, suh that the envelope

and the periodi fators in the laser-matter interation (2) depend on di(cid:27)erent time

oordinates

(E(s), d) cos(ωt + ϕ)

V (s, t) =
−
H(s, t) = H0 + V (s, t)

.

One also introdues a seond time dynamis

(i

∂
∂s

∂
∂t

+ i

)Ψ(s, t) = (H0 + V (s, t; ϕ))Ψ(s, t)

.

It is not di(cid:30)ult to see that if Ψ(s, t) satis(cid:28)es (4), the solution of (1) an be written
|s=t . Indeed, restriting the solution to the (cid:16)diagonal(cid:17) time s = t and
as Ψ(t) = Ψ(s, t)

substituting it to the left-hand side of the equation (1) we get the left-hand side of the

equation (4)

i

∂
∂t

Ψ(t, t) = (i

+ i

)Ψ(s, t)

∂
∂s

∂
∂t

.

|s=t

The right-hand sides of the equations (1) and (4) are idential at s = t. Thus, one

the 2D-time equation is solved, one has a solution of the original equation (1) as well.

More detailed disussion of the 2D-time formalism an be found at the original paper

of Peskin and Moiseev [7℄.

2.2. Floquet representation for a (cid:28)nite-time pulse

If the laser pulse duration is not onsiderably shorter than the osillation period 2π/ω ,
expanding the wave funtion Ψ(s, t) into a Fourier series in t an be a reasonable way

of solving equation (4), even for pulse duration omparable with the osillation period

[8℄. In fat, this approah holds as far as the desription of the laser pulse itself in terms

of arrier and envelope is valid [11℄. In this paper we disuss pulses longer than one

osillation period, and, thus, our approah to solving equation (4) is justi(cid:28)ed.

We start onstruting the Floquet representation [9, 10℄ for the laser pulse from

expanding the wave funtion

We shall all the oe(cid:30)ients φn(s) n-photon emission (n > 0) and absorption (n < 0)

Bringing the time derivative i ∂

∂t to the right hand side of equation (4) and

substituting the representation (5) we ome up with the following in(cid:28)nite system of

equations

and propagating the amplitudes aording to (6) su(cid:30)iently long, we an investigate

di(cid:27)erent laser-indued proesses, suh as dissoiation, ionization, (de)exitation et.

It is onvenient to introdue a vetor of n-photon amplitudes Φ(s; ϕ) and a Floquet

where H0 stands for the diagonal and V(s; ϕ) for the o(cid:27)-diagonal terms in the equation

Hamiltonian

H(s; ϕ)

H0 + V(s; ϕ)

≡

(6). The equation (6) an be written as

i

∂
∂s

Φ(s; ϕ) = H(s; ϕ)Φ(s; ϕ)

.

In this notation we emphasize that the Floquet Hamiltonian and the solution both

depend on the arrier-envelope phase ϕ. This dependene, however, is parametri, and

it an be eliminated.

2.3. Unitary equivalene of the CEP

The obvious advantage of equation (6) for studying the CEP e(cid:27)et is that the phase

dependene enters the equation linearly. As we shall see, it allows exlusion of the CE

phase from the Floquet Hamiltonian by a simple unitary transformation.

Let us introdue the following operator U(ϕ) ating in the n-photon amplitude

spae

[U(ϕ)]mn = δmne−inϕ

.

Now onsider the Floquet Hamiltonian H(0)orresponding to ϕ = 0. It is easy to verify

that the following relation holds:

H(ϕ) = U†(ϕ)H(0)U(ϕ)

and to rewrite the evolution equation as

i∂sU(ϕ)φ(s; ϕ) = H(0)U(ϕ)φ(s; ϕ)

.

This equation helps to establish the main result of this paper, whih is the unitary

equivalene of solutions orresponding to di(cid:27)erent arrier-envelope phases

Φ(s; ϕ) = U†(ϕ)Φ(s; 0)

.

This relationship allows any CEP e(cid:27)et to be interpreted as interferene of di(cid:27)erent n-

photon hannels. It an be learly seen if we reall the expression for the wave funtion

(7)

(8)

in physial time

Ψ(t; ϕ) =

einϕ ˜φn(t; 0) ,

where we have introdued the (cid:28)nal state omponents of the wave funtion

˜φn(t; 0) =
einωtφn(t; 0). After the laser pulse is o(cid:27) at the moment t = t0 , the omponents
˜φn depend on time uniformly due to the internal dynamis of the system only, i.e.
φ(t) = e−iH0(t−t0)φ(t0). Depending on the laser CEP, the wave funtion omponents
˜φn
gain phases proportional to the orresponding net number of exhanged photons n and
the CEP ϕ.

It is important to note that all the given results are obtained under rather general

assumptions of dipole laser-matter interation and a stable shape of the laser pulse. We

did not assume anything spei(cid:28) for any partiular physial system. That means that

any CEP e(cid:27)et an be onsidered as interferene of several n-photon hannels.

2.4. CEP e(cid:27)et observation

Before disussing appliation of the formula (8) to partiular model systems, we say a

few words on observing the phase e(cid:27)ets in general.

Let

ˆO be an observable of interest. Using the representation (8) at large times we get
ˆO through the n-photon omponents

3. Numerial illustrations

qualitative.

In the following setion we give two types of demonstrations: quantitative and

Quantitatively, we shall hek the agreement of equations (7) and (8) with CEP

results alulated independently. For that type of demonstration we have to alulate

the n-photon amplitudes either from a diret solution of equation (4) or by extrating

them from an independently alulated (cid:28)nal state wave funtion. Knowledge of the

amplitudes, however, is rather expensive. To predit the CEP response of any partiular

physial system, we have to know not only the population probabilities of the Floquet

states, but their phases as well. Usually, this information an be obtained only from a

numerial solution of the TDSE, and we shall explain how expression (8) an be used

to redue the amount of numerial alulations.

Qualitatively, we shall disuss the physial onditions needed to observe CEP e(cid:27)ets

experimentally. Suh onditions are equivalent to the existene of several interfering

omponents. In fat, as equations (7,8) suggest, CEP e(cid:27)ets exist if and only if several

n-photon omponents ontribute to the same physial state. We shall see how this

ondition is realized in a simple 2-level model. On this example we shall disuss intensity

and pulse duration dependene of the CEP e(cid:27)ets. We should mention, however,

that not all the physial systems onventionally treated in a 2-level approximation are

suitable for lear CEP e(cid:27)et demonstrations. For instane, hoosing an experimental

realization, one has to ful(cid:28)ll the ondition that the two states used in the demonstration

must be well separated from other eigenstates of the system, beause the important

transitions have essentially nonresonant multiphoton harater. Suh systems an be

realized, for example, as double quantum dots [13, 14℄ or as ioni hyper(cid:28)ne qubits

[15℄. Although the 2-level model annot desribe proesses of ionization or moleular

dissoiation realistially, it still gives a reasonable qualitative desription of the CEP

e(cid:27)et observability. More detailed study of the CEP e(cid:27)ets involving ontinuum states

is a sub jet for another investigation.

In all the examples we shall use a Gaussian shape of the laser pulse

This line is shown in the Fig. 1 together with results of diret solution of equation

(12). Sine no approximations were made, besides utting o(cid:27) the series (13), the perfet

agreement is not surprising.

Giving this example, we alulated the Floquet amplitudes by diret solution of the

system of equations (6). In pratial appliations, however, this approah is not e(cid:27)etive:

usually, solving a small system n times is simpler than solving an n times bigger system

of equations one. In the ase of the equations (6) the situation is even worse. Even if

we have only 3 omponents ontributing to the (cid:28)nal state, as in our example, one needs

more than 5 Floquet bloks kept in the equations to reprodue the orret dynamis even

for moderate peak (cid:28)elds. Beause of that, reovering the amplitudes by subsequently

solving the original Shrödinger equations diretly for several CE phases and (cid:28)tting

the expression (8) to the wave funtion should be a muh more e(cid:27)etive proedure for

realisti alulations.

After giving this numerial example, we are ready to disuss some qualitative

properties of the CEP e(cid:27)ets. Are there any onditions for the peak interation energy

V0 and the pulse duration τ that limit an observability of CEP e(cid:27)ets?

Let us disuss the intensity dependene (cid:28)rst.

In order to have interferene, one

has to make sure that there are several n-photon omponents ontributing to the states

with the same (cid:28)nal state energy.

It annot be ahieved with one-photon transitions

only, so there must be a minimal intensity that allows a lear observation of the CEP

e(cid:27)et. To understand the lower intensity limit, onsider the eigenvalues of H shown

in Fig. 2. On the leading edge of the laser pulse the interation energy grows up, this

orreponds to moving from the left to the right in Fig. 2. After the peak, whih de(cid:28)nes

the rightmost point in Fig. 2, the system goes from the right to the left during the

trailing edge of the pulse. As one an see from traking the eigenvalues of the dressed

system, the two rossings that we need to populate the state |
transitions orrespond to the interation energies VT 1 ≈

b
i via 1- and 3-photon
0.1 a.u..

0 a.u. and VT 2 ≈

This gives us a limitation on the laser peak intensity: no interferene an happen if the

maximal (cid:28)eld-matter interation energy does not approah the seond rossing. We an

safely say that in our example no CEP e(cid:27)et is expeted if the peak interation energy

is smaller than 0.05 a.u.. This observation is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we have plotted

the weighted CEP e(cid:27)et amplitude (11). As we expeted, we see an essential growth

of the CEP e(cid:27)et ontrast only above 0.05 a.u., when the peak (cid:28)eld starts approahing

the 3-photon rossing.

The big maximal intensity alone, however, is not enough to observe the e(cid:27)et:

the (cid:28)eld should hange fast enough when passing through both rossings, otherwise

transition happens adiabatially, and no population transfer ours. The proper timing

onditions must be satis(cid:28)ed. This leads us to the question of the pulse duration

dependene of the CEP e(cid:27)ets.

As we have seen, nonadiabati seond transition (see Fig. 2) is a neessary ondition

for the CEP observation. We an use the Landau-Zener model to qualify the presene

of the CEP e(cid:27)ets by estimating the seond transition probability as a funtion of the

pulse duration. Let VT 2 be the position of the seond rossing. For the energy gap of
our example (∆ = 0.066 a.u.) the level splitting is about g(VT 2) = 0.016 a.u.‡ The

‡ For small energy gaps ompared to the photon energy we an use a Bessel approximation to the

spetrum of the Floquet Hamiltonian. This allows us to estimate the splitting of the Floquet eigenstates

If no higher order transitions happen, the amplitude of the CEP e(cid:27)et should be

proportional to the square root of this probability, sine it is proportional to the

amplitude rather than the probability of the m-photon state population. This square

root of the probability is shown in Fig. 4a together with the amplitude of the exitation

probability CEP dependene. It is lear that probability (14) should have a substantial

value to make possible an observation of the CEP e(cid:27)ets. Equation (14) shows that

CEP e(cid:27)ets should disappear exponentially with growing pulse length.

Calulations were performed with 30 Floquet bloks, the sensitivity parameter δ in
(11) is set to 0.01.

It is important to mention that the pulse duration needed to observe the CEP e(cid:27)ets

is a property of the laser-matter interation rather than the laser pulse alone. In the

two-level model, as equation (14) suggests, it is de(cid:28)ned by level splitting at the seond

rossing point and the position of the seond rossing. For large energy gaps it is easy

to obtain smaller multiphoton splitting. This allows one to predit the CEP e(cid:27)ets even

for pulses that are substantially longer than one osillation period, as demonstrated

in Fig. 4b. There we show the CEP observability σ together with its Landau-Zener
estimation. Even for pulses longer than τ = 1700 a.u., what is about 30 periods in the

(cid:28)eld FWHM, we still an see a variation of the probability with the CEP about 10%.

We must mention, however, that experimental observability of the long-pulse e(cid:27)et an

be limited by the stability of the pulse shape, whih might be di(cid:30)ult to keep at a time

sale smaller than one osillation period for long pulses.

4. Summary

We have investigated a quantum state experiening a laser pulse of a stable envelope

shape and varying CEP of the osillatory part. We have shown how the CEP an be

exluded from evolution equations and how the CEP dependene of the (cid:28)nal state an

be reovered from CEP-independent results. On the example of a 2-level system we

have demonstrated a ritial intensity and pulse duration dependene of CEP e(cid:27)ets.

In ontrast to the ommon oneption that CEP e(cid:27)ets an be expeted only when the

pulse duration is nearly as short as the laser osillation period, we have demonstrated

that CEP e(cid:27)ets an exist even for pulses muh longer than that. The pulse duration

that allows the CEP e(cid:27)et observation ritially depends on the properties of the

system interating with a laser pulse.

In the 2-level system, long-pulse CEP e(cid:27)ets

an be observed in essentially above-threshold exitation regimes, when the energy gap

is onsiderably larger than the photon energy.

The approah whih is suggested in this paper is rather general, and it would

be interesting to study more omplex systems from this point of view. For instane,

it would be interesting to study how n-photon omponent interferene a(cid:27)ets high-

Unitary theory of laser Carrier-Envelope Phase e(cid:27)ets

harmoni generation, ionization and dissoiation in di(cid:27)erent systems. There are also

many physial and mathematial questions to be addressed, suh as gauge-invariant

formulation of the theory and heking the lassial limits of the interferene e(cid:27)et.

We investigate diﬀerential electron momentum distributions in non-sequential double ionization
(NSDI) with linearly polarized, few-cycle pulses, using a classical model based on a laser-assisted
inelastic (e−, 2e−) rescattering mechanism. We show that these yields, as functions of the momentum
components parallel to the laser polarization, are highly asymmetric and strongly inﬂuenced by the
absolute phase, i.e., the phase diﬀerence between the carrier oscillation of a few-cycle pulse and its
envelope. Indeed, around a critical phase, such distributions change their sign in a radical fashion.
This phase dependence provides a possibility for absolute-phase measurements which is, in principle,
superior to the schemes involving high-order harmonic generation or above-threshold ionization.

Recently, few-cycle laser pulses of intensities around
2
or higher than 1014W/cm
have proven to be extremely
important. A particular characteristic of such pulses is
that they may have very high intensities and, still, carry
much less energy than their longer counterparts, such
that, eﬀectively, ionization is reduced. This has extended
the damage threshold of solid-state materials up to the
intensities in question [1], and has made the generation of
high-order harmonic radiation up to astonishingly high
frequencies possible [2]. Furthermore, their length, of the
order of a few f s, permits controling processes such as
molecular motion or chemical reactions [3], as well as the
production of isolated, X- ray attosecond pulses [4].

In this pulse-length regime, the so-called “absolute
phase”, i.e., the phase diﬀerence between the envelope
of the pulse and its carrier frequency, has considerable
inﬂuence on several strong-ﬁeld phenomena, as for in-
stance high-order harmonic generation (HHG) [5] and
above-threshold ionization [6] (ATI) [7, 8]. Indeed, this
phase determines features such as the maximal harmonic
or photoelectron energy, the time proﬁle of both phenom-
ena, and the intensity of the ATI or HHG yields.

This is not surprising, since the physics of HHG and
ATI is directly related to the instantaneous, time depen-
dent ﬁeld. HHG, for instance, is described by a three-step
mechanism in which an electron leaves an atom at an in-
stant t0 through tunneling ionization, propagates in the
continuum under the inﬂuence of the external laser ﬁeld
and, at a later time t1, recombines with a bound state of
the parent ion, generating harmonics [9]. Slightly diﬀer-
ent processes, either in which elastic rescattering with the
parent ion is taken as the third step, or in which the elec-
tron reaches the detector without recolliding explain the
high-order and low-order ATI peaks, respectively [10].

In order to interprete the experimental data obtained
in such cases, the precise knowledge of the absolute phase
φ is required. This poses a serious practical problem,
since this phase is diﬃcult to stabilize, to control or to
measure [11]. For this reason, schemes for measuring φ
have been suggested and realized, as, for instance, using

the asymmetry in ATI photoelectron counts [7].

2

In this Letter, we propose laser-assisted nonsequen-
tial double ionization (NSDI) as a tool for absolute
phase diagnosis. This phenomenon is being the sub-
ject of very active discussion, which was triggered by
diﬀerential measurements of electron momentum distri-
butions performed with the COLTRIMS (Cold Target
Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy) technique, for lin-
early polarized ﬁelds of intensities of the order of I ∼
1014−1015W/cm
incident in rare-gas samples [12]. Such
measurements revealed very peculiar features, namely
two symmetric peaks at p1k = p2k = ±2
Up, in the
p1k, p2k
plane, where pjk(j = 1, 2) and Up denote the
momentum components parallel to the laser ﬁeld polar-
(cid:0)
ization and the ponderomotive energy [13], respectively.
These features are explained by a physical mechanism
very similar to those in HHG and high-order ATI, in-
volving tunnel ionization at a time t0, propagation in the
continuum and rescattering at a later time t1. The main
diﬀerence lies on the rescattering process at t1, which is
now inelastic: the ﬁrst electron gives part of its kinetic
energy upon return to the second electron, so that it can
overcome the ionization potential of the singly ionized
atom and reach the continuum [9].

p

(cid:1)

This laser-assisted rescattering process has been con-
sidered by several groups, using either classical [14], semi-
classical [15, 16, 17, 18] or quantum-mechanical [19, 20,
21] approaches, diﬀerent types of electron-electron inter-
action [15, 17, 18], and neglecting or including electron-
electron repulsion in the ﬁnal states [17, 18, 19]. So far,
since the pulses involved were relatively long, they have
been mostly approximated by monochromatic ﬁelds.

Particularly what classical models concern, it is aston-
ishing how well they reproduce the main features either
observed experimentally, or obtained by means of more
reﬁned, quantum mechanical methods. In fact, in recent
publications, we have computed NSDI yields using both a
classical model based on the rescattering mechanism and
a quantum-mechanical model in which a corresponding
S-Matrix is calculated using saddle-point methods, ob-

taining practically identical results [17, 18].

The electron momentum distributions then read

Therefore, in this work, we use a similar classical model
as in [17, 18], in which an ensemble of electrons is subject
to an electric ﬁeld E(t) = −dA(t)/dt. The few-cycle pulse
of frequency ω, amplitude A0 and phase φ is given by

with Ω = ω/n, where n denotes the number of cycles.

where |E01| is the ionization potential of the atom in
question. At a later instant t1, they return to the site

through inelastic collisions.

Eq.
(3) gives the energy conservation at the ioniza-
tion time. According to this equation, the ﬁrst elec-
tron leaves the atom at
t0 with vanishing drift veloc-
ity. Eq. (4) imposes restrictions upon the intermediate
electron momentum k such that the electron returns to
its parent ion. Finally, the third expression (Eq.
(5))
yields the energy conservation at the recollision time t1.
Thereby, the ﬁrst electron gives part of its kinetic en-
ergy Eret(t1) = [k + A(t1)]2/2 upon return to the second
electron, so that it is able to overcome the ionization
potential |E02| of the singly ionized atom. In terms of
the momentum components parallel and perpendicular
to the electric-ﬁeld polarization, denoted pjk and pj⊥,
respectively, Eq. (5) is written as

Eq. (6) describes a circle in the (p1k, p2k) plane, centered
at A(t1) and whose radius depends on Eret, |E02| and on
p2
j⊥(j = 1, 2). The transverse momenta eﬀectively shift
the binding energy which must be overcome such that,
depending on this quantity, there are situations for which
the rescattering process is classically forbidden.

These distributions are displayed in the upper panels
of Fig. 1, for neon [23], as density plots in the (p1k, p2k)
plane. Their circular shapes and the maxima along
p1k = p2k are features also present for monochromatic
driving ﬁelds [24], and mean, physically, that both elec-
trons are leaving the parent ion most probably with equal
parallel momenta. However, the fact that the yields are
concentrated in only one quadrant of the (p1k, p2k) plane,
makes them strikingly diﬀerent from the former distribu-
tions, which are symmetric in (p1k, p2k) ↔ (−p1k, −p2k).
Furthermore, for a narrow phase interval around a crit-
ical phase (c.f. panel (c)), the sign of the momenta pjk
change in a rather radical fashion, and the whole yield is
shifted from the ﬁrst to the third quadrant.

Important questions concern the physical origin of
both the asymmetry and the critical phase: are they
caused by the phase space or by the tunneling rate (2)?
Depending on the parameters, a whole phase-space re-
gion may become classically inacessible, such that the
radius of the circle described by Eq. (6) would collapse
and the corresponding NSDI yields would vanish. The
quasi-static tunneling rate, on the other hand, favors the
start times t0 for which the instantaneous ﬁeld amplitude
|E(t0)| is large, as compared to those for which |E(t0)|
is small. Thus, the contributions to the yield from the
former or from the latter case would be enhanced or sup-
pressed, respectively.

In order to single out the inﬂuence of the phase space,
we assume that the electrons belonging to the ﬁrst en-
semble reach the continuum at a constant rate. Such
results are shown in the lower panels of Fig. 1, and are
radically diﬀerent from those obtained with the more re-
alistic, quasi-static tunneling rate. Indeed, the momen-
tum distributions, though asymmetric, exhibit peaks in
both ﬁrst and third quadrants of the (p1k, p2k) plane,
vaguely resembling those obtained with monochromatic
driving ﬁelds. The asymmetry is expected, since, for
such pulses, the relation A(t) = −A(t ± T /2), and thus
|Γ(t1, t0, p1k, p2k)| = |Γ(t1 ± T /2, t0 ± T /2, −p1k, −p2k)|,
where T = 2π/ω, which was true for monochromatic
ﬁelds, no longer holds. However, the huge eﬀects ob-
served in the upper panels are absent. Physically, this
means that there is a momentum region for which the
rescattering process is classically allowed but for which
the probability that the ﬁrst electron reaches the contin-
uum is very small. Consequently, even if this region is
large, its contributions to the yield will be negligible.

In Fig. 2 we analyze this eﬀect in detail. Therein,
the electron start times t0 are plotted, together with the

quasi-static rate. We choose a restricted parameter range
for which the classically allowed region is most extense
[25], namely parallel momenta along the diagonal p1k =
p2k = pk and vanishing transverse momenta [16]. We
consider only pairs (t1, t0) of start and return times for
the ﬁrst electron such that its excursion time ∆t = t1 −t0
in the continuum is of the order of T /2 [26]. For the
speciﬁc parameters of the ﬁgure, there exist mainly two
sets of electrons for which the quasi-static rate is large
and, therefore, whose contributions are relevant: those
ejected at 1.5T < t0 < 2T , with positive momenta, and
those released at 2T < t0 < 2.5T , with negative momenta
[27]. For a large range of absolute phases, the quasi-static

(|E01| = 0.79 a.u. and |E02| = 1.51 a.u.) subject to a four-
cycle pulse of frequency ω = 0.057 a.u. and intensities I = 4×
1014W/cm2 and I = 8×1014W/cm2 (upper and lower panels,
respectively). In the ﬁgure, the electrons were assumed to be
ejected with the quasi-static tunneling rate. The absoltue
phases are the same as in Fig. 1.

rate corresponding to the former set of trajectories is very
large. Furthermore, the latter set of trajectories is not
classically allowed. Thus, the distributions concentrate
on the ﬁrst quadrant.

This no longer holds for φ = 0.9π, which is larger than
the critical phase.
In this case, both sets of electrons
are contributing to the yield and the electrons ejected at
2T < t0 < 2.5T are favored. Consequently, the momenta
are mainly negative. Around the critical phase, the tun-
neling rates are comparable. Thus, there exist contribu-
tions to the yield in the ﬁrst and third quadrants.

The role of the phase space is seen even more clearly
as the driving-ﬁeld intensity is varied (c.f., Fig. 3). By
doing so, one is changing the radius of the circle described
by Eq. (6), and thus the region in the (p1k, p2k) plane for
which rescattering is classically allowed. Therefore, the
critical phase may change.

For instance, for a lower intensity (Fig. 3(a)-(d)), the
yield in the positive momentum region vanishes for a crit-
ical phase after the expected value of φ = 0.8π (c.f. pan-
els (c) and (d)). This is due to the fact that the classi-
cally allowed region for pk < 0 is almost vanishing in this
case. Thus, even though the tunneling rates are compa-
rable, the ﬁrst electron, upon return, no longer possesses
enough kinetic energy to release the second electron in
a way that both leave with negative momenta. For a
higher intensity, apart from the fact that both regions
are classically allowed, the probability that the electron is
released with negative parallel momenta is larger. There-
fore, the transition occurs where expected, as displayed
in panel (g). This is shown in Fig. 4, where, as the in-
tensity decreases, the dominant set of ionization times
(2T < t0 < 2.5T ), corresponding to pk < 0, collapses.

In conclusion, we perform a theoretical investigation of
NSDI with few-cycle pulses. We use the classical, rescat-
tering model in which an electron freed through tunneling

in the previous ﬁgures. For the lowest intensity, rescattering

ionization recollides with its parent ion, releasing a sec-

4

ond electron. At the end of the process, both electrons
have equal momentum components parallel to the ﬁeld
polarization, which are either positive or negative. The
sign of such momenta and their most probable values
strongly depend on the absolute phase φ. In particular,
around a critical phase, these momenta change sign. All
such features are explained as the interplay between the
tunneling rate for the ﬁrst electron and the phase space.

The changes in the NSDI yields upon a critical phase
are far more extreme eﬀects than those observed for
HHG or ATI. In fact, nonsequential double ionization
has an advantage over the other two phenomena: the
phase space region contributing to the process is con-
ﬁned. Thus, for particular ranges of φ, it is easier to
make a whole region either classically forbidden, by mak-
ing the radius in Eq. (6) collapse, or irrelevant, by reduc-
ing the corresponding ionization rate. Therefore, NSDI
is, in principle, a tool for absolute phase diagnosis which
is more eﬃcient than the existing schemes.

[23] The best agreement between the experiments and theo-
retical computations with the rescattering model are ob-
tained for neon, in the monochromatic case.

[24] This only holds if the interaction by which the ﬁrst elec-
trons dislodge the second is of contact type, i.e. V12 =
δ(r1)δ(r2 − r1). This interaction is implicit in Eq. (7).
For other types of interactions, which may favor unequal
momenta, see, e.g., Ref.[17].

[25] The start and return times coalesce at the maximal and
minimal classically allowed momenta, deﬁning a conﬁned

region in phase space.

[26] Longer excursion times are not relevant to the yields due
to wave-packet spreading: the overlap between the wave
packets of the ﬁrst and of the second electron would be
negligible. In our classical model, this means that the
corresponding electrons can be left out of the ensemble.

[27] Other sets of electrons (t0 <

∼ 1.5T ) do not contribute to
the yield, since the corresponding tunneling rate is very
small. Their inﬂuence would occur for pk < 0, and is seen
if the tunneling rate is artiﬁcially taken to be constant
(c.f. lower panels of Fig.1).

Abstract

In the recent paper [1] the order α4R∞ corrections to the positronium P levels
were reconsidered. Those calculations conﬁrm our corresponding results, except for
the contribution due to the squared spin-orbit interaction. We present here a new
derivation of our previous result for this last correction, this derivation being to our
opinion both simple and convincing.

High-precision measurements of positronium level structure provide a unique test of
quantum electrodynamics. Of course, as accurate theoretical calculations are necessary for
this test. In Refs. [2, 3] we have found analytically the corrections of order α4R∞ to the
positronium P levels.

As mentioned in [2, 3], this theoretical problem for states of nonvanishing angular

momenta is quite tractable, the main diﬃculty being of the “book-keeping” nature.

One could be only pleased that this tedious calculation has been checked in recent paper
[1]. Our results for almost all contributions to the correction discussed, are conﬁrmed
there. The only exception is the term induced by the spin-orbit interaction squared. The
corresponding operator is

V =

α
8m4

4π
q2 (S[p × p′])

.

Here S is the total spin operator, p and p′ are momenta of the initial and ﬁnal states,
respectively; q2 = (p′ − p)2. Our result for the correction induced by this operator is

δE = ǫn

[2(lS)2 + (lS) + 2S(S + 1)].

Here ǫn ≡ mα6/n3, m is the electron mass, n is the principal quantum number, l is the
orbital angular momentum. The result of Ref. [1] is diﬀerent:

δE = ǫn

The disagreement is most probably due to diﬀerent treatment of the matrix element
in the coordinate representation at r → 0, which is the only subtle point in the whole
problem. Therefore, after getting acquainted with Ref. [1], we did not conﬁne to performing
again the calculations in the coordinate representation in two independent ways, though
this check conﬁrmed our formula (2) and in particular the fact that for a P -wave both
structures 2(lS)2 + (lS) and 2S(S + 1) should enter with the same coeﬃcient. We used as
well a diﬀerent approach, where the most part of calculations was done in the momentum
representation, which allows one to get rid at all of the spurious singularities at r → 0, or
at large q. This is the approach we present below.

The momentum part of the expectation value we are interested in, can be written as

The only term in the rhs contributing to the correction (4), is B(p)δijpk. To calculate it
explicitly, let us multiply Eq. (5) by (δij − pipj/p2)pk. In this way we obtain

B(p) =

we arrive at the following expression for the energy correction:

δE = −

Thus, without ever running into singular expressions or integrals, we have demonstrated
that 2(lS)2 + (lS) and 2S(S + 1) enter the result in a sum only. It is convenient now to go
over in the perfectly convergent radial expectation value < 4πq2 + 4π
q2 (p2 − p′2)2 > to the
coordinate representation. With the obvious identity

the correction is rewritten as

This is a simple matter now to reproduce our formula (2).

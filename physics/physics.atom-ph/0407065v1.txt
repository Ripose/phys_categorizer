The electronic structure of the lithium atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld 0 ≤ γ ≤ 10 is investigated.
Our computational approach is a full conﬁguration interaction method based on a set of anisotropic
Gaussian orbitals that is nonlinearly optimized for each ﬁeld strength. Accurate results for the total
energies and one-electron ionization energies for the ground and several excited states for each of the
symmetries 20+, 2(−1)+, 4(−1)+, 4(−1)−, 2(−2)+, 4(−2)+, 4(−3)+ are presented. The behaviour of
these energies as a function of the ﬁeld strength is discussed and classiﬁed. Transition wave lengths
for linear and circular polarized transitions are presented as well.

INTRODUCTION

During the past twenty years an enormous develop-
ment of our knowledge on atoms exposed to strong mag-
netic ﬁelds has taken place (see the reviews [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
and references therein). Focusing on astrophysical con-
ditions and on the ﬁeld regime 100 ≤ B ≤ 105 T for
magnetic white dwarfs it is in particular the one and two-
electron problems, i.e. the hydrogen and helium atom,
whose behavior and properties in strong magnetic ﬁelds
have been investigated in detail. In both cases our knowl-
edge on the electronic structure of the atoms has had
major impact on astrophysical observation. For the hy-
drogen atom a huge amount of data is nowadays avail-
able both with respect to the bound state energy levels
and transition moments [2] as well as for the continuum
properties [6]. Among others, the corresponding data
have lead to a conclusive interpretation of the observed
spectrum of the white dwarf GrW+70◦8247 which was
a key to our understanding of the properties of spec-
tra of magnetic white dwarfs in general (see e.g. Refs.
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]).

In the late nineties a powerful computational approach
was developed and implemented in order to study many-
electron atomic problems in the presence of a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld. During the past six years this approach was
applied in order to investigate the electronic structure of
the helium atom thereby covering the complete regime of
astrophysically relevant ﬁeld strengths [12, 13]. Approx-
imately 90 excited electronic states are now known with
high accuracy thereby yielding 12000 transition wave-
lengths. As a consequence strong evidence arose that
the mysterious absorption edges of the magnetic white
dwarf GD229 [14, 15, 16], which were for almost 25 years

unexplained, are due to helium in a strong magnetic ﬁeld
B ≈ 50 000 T [17, 18]. Also very recently the newly es-
tablished helium data were used to analyze a number of
magnetic and suspected-magnetic southern white dwarfs
[19, 20].

Although our knowledge on the electronic structure
of hydrogen and helium in a strong magnetic ﬁeld have
allowed for the interpretation of absorption features of
a variety of magnetic white dwarfs, there are other mag-
netic objects whose spectra can not be explained in terms
of these species. In addition, due to the increasing avail-
ability of observatories with higher resolutions and sensi-
tivities, new spectra have been obtained that remain un-
explained [21], thereby opening the necessity for studies
of heavier atoms exposed to magnetic ﬁelds: The ongoing
Sloan Digital Sky Survey already doubled the number of
known magnetic white dwarfs [22].
It is believed that
these heavy atoms are present in the atmospheres of the
corresponding stars due to accretion of interstellar mat-
ter, and particularly it is expected that these objects are
quite common [23].
In spite of this interest in multi-
electron atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds there is only a
very scarce literature. One reason for this is certainly
the conceptual and computational diﬃculties associated
with the competing electron-electron, electron-nuclear-
attraction, paramagnetic and diamagnetic interactions
which are of comparable strength under astrophysical
conditions.

The present work makes a start to ﬁll the above-
mentioned gap and develops a full conﬁguration interac-
tion (full CI) approach for multi-electron systems thereby
focusing on the lithium atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld.
Let us comment at this point on the state-of-the-art of
the literature on the lithium atom exposed to the ﬁeld
thereby following a chronological order.
In Ref. [24] a
combination of an adiabatic and Hartree-Fock (HF) ap-
proach is employed to obtain ground state energies for
four diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths in the high ﬁeld regime.
Ref. [25] provides also values of the ground state energy

via a HF adiabatic approach in the high ﬁeld regime.
Ref. [26] equally employs an unrestricted HF approach in
order to obtain the energies of the ground states of the
symmetry subspaces 20+,2 (−1)+,4 (−1)+,4 (−1)− for the
weak to intermediate regime of ﬁeld strengths γ = 0 − 5
(γ denotes the magnetic ﬁeld strength in atomic units,
where γ = 1 correspondes to 2.355 105 T). Ref. [27]
contains also a HF investigation of the 120+, 12(−1)+,
14(−1)+, 12(−1)−, 14(−3)+ electronic states in the com-
plete regime γ = 0 − 1000. Neutral atoms for nuclear
charge numbers Z = 1 − 10 in the high ﬁeld regime are
investigated in Ref. [28] equally within a HF approach.
The crossovers of the symmetries of the ground states are
discussed and analyzed in detail. Ref. [29] uses a so-called
frozen-core approach to simplify the three-electron prob-
lem in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. This was the ﬁrst fully cor-
related approach to the lithium atom although it is only
valid, i.e. reliable, for not too strong magnetic ﬁelds. The
three energetically lowest states of 20+, 2(−1)+, 2(−2)+
symmetry have been studied for the regime γ = 0 − 5.4.
More recently [30] adds to these results a denser grid of
ﬁeld strengths for the same regime of ﬁeld strengths and
provides also a few oscillator strengths of the correspond-
ing transitions. Finally [31] provides some results on the
ground state energies of neutral atoms Z = 1 − 26 for a
few ﬁeld strengths.

The present investigation goes in several respects sig-
niﬁcantly beyond the results in the existing literature on
lithium in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. First of all it covers the
complete weak to intermediate regime of ﬁeld strengths
γ = 0 − 10 and more importantly we provide accurate
results of the energies and transition wave lengths for
many excited states that have not been studied so far
employing a fully correlated approach. The ground and
many excited states for each of the symmetry subspaces
20+, 2(−1)+, 4(−1)+, 4(−1)−, 2(−2)+, 4(−2)+, 4(−3)+
are investigated thereby yielding a total of 28 states and
their behavior as a function of the ﬁeld strength for a
grid of 11 ﬁeld strengths in the above-mentioned regime.
This multiplies the existing knowledge on the electronic
structure of the lithium atom in strong ﬁelds.

In detail we proceed as follows. Section II provides
the electronic Hamiltonian and discusses its symmetries.
Section III contains a description of our full conﬁgu-
ration interaction approach and its implementation as
well as remarks on the basis set of nonlinearly optimized
anisotropic Gaussian orbitals. Section IV, which is the
central part of this work, presents the results i.e. the total
and ionization energies for the ground and many excited
states for a variety of symmetries. Section V yields the
wavelengths of the electromagnetic transitions. We close
with a summary in section VI.

II. HAMILTONIAN AND SYMMETRIES

The starting point of our investigations is the elec-
tronic Hamiltonian for inﬁnite nuclear mass, which takes

in atomic units (a.u.) and for the symmetric gauge of the
vector potential the following form:

H(B) =

Hi(B) +

B · li

+

Hij =

|ri − rj|

|ri|

+

gB · si

(2)

(3)

Here Hi(B) represents the one-particle Hamiltonian of
the i-th particle and Hij is the two-particle interaction
between particles i and j. Speciﬁcally Hi(B) contains
the Zeeman-term 1/2 B · li, which represents the inter-
action of the magnetic ﬁeld with the angular momentum
of the electron, the diamagnetic term 1/8(B × ri)2, the
Coulomb interaction with the nuclear charge −3/|ri|, and
the spin Zeeman-term g/2 B ·si. The two-particle opera-
tors represents the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion.
If the magnetic ﬁeld is chosen to point in z direction,
the component of the total angular momentum along the
z-axis M , the total spin S, the z projection of the total
spin Sz, and the total z parity Πz are conserved. In the
following we use the spectroscopic notation ν2S+1M Πz
for the electronic states. Here ν stands for the degree
of excitation, with respect to the speciﬁed symmetry. In
the following all total energies are given for the spin bee-
ing maximal polarized antiparallel to the direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld (i.e. Sz = −S). Energies for other spin
projections can be obtained by adding the corresponding
spin Zeeman-energy diﬀerence.

III. NUMERICAL METHOD

The Schr¨odinger equation is solved by applying a full
CI approach. The basic ingredient is an anisotropic
Gaussian basis set, which was put forward by Schmelcher
and Cederbaum [32], and which has been successfully ap-
plied to several atoms, ions and molecules [12, 13, 33, 34].
The corresponding basis functions have been optimized
for each ﬁeld strength, and each symmetry separately, in
order to solve diﬀerent one- and two-particle problems,
i.e. H, Li+, and Li2+, in a magnetic ﬁeld of the corre-
sponding strength. Therefore a nonlinear optimization
procedure has been applied, which has been worked out
in our group (see Refs. [12, 13]).

Our lithium calculations have been performed using a
conﬁgurational basis set of three-electron Slater determi-
nants. The latter are constructed from the canonical or-
thogonal one-particle basis set (see Ref. [35]), which is ob-
tained by the following cut-oﬀ technique. In the ﬁrst step
the overlap matrix S(mj, πzj ) of the primitive Gaussian
Its eigenvectors {vsj (mj, πzj )}
orbitals is constructed.
and corresponding eigenvalues {esj (mj , πzj )} are deter-
mined. For the following calculations we restrict the
number of eigenvectors vsj , to those which posses eigen-
values esj above an appropriate chosen threshold ε. This

way we avoid quasi-linear dependencies in the conﬁgura-
tion space generated by our optimized basis set. With
the remaining vectors vsk the Schr¨odinger equation for
the one-particle Hamiltonian Hi(B) is mapped on an or-
dinary matrix eigenvalue problem. The latter is solved
numerically and the resulting eigenvectors {hi(mj, πzj )}
serve as the spatial part of our one-particle basis set for
the electronic structure calculations. The spinors χj are
products of this orthogonal one-particle basis functions
hi(mj, πzj ) and the usual spin eigenfunctions α or β.
Three-electron Slater determinants are constructed from
spinors obeying the correct symmetries, i.e.

m1 + m2 + m3 = M
πz1πz2 πz3 = Πz
sz1 + sz2 + sz3 = Sz.

(5)
(6)

In order to keep the one-particle basis set as small as
possible, an appropriate selection scheme for the basis
functions is crucial. This concerns the selection of the
symmetries of the one-particle functions as well as the
selection from appropriate sets of orbitals, which result
from the above mentioned nonlinear optimizations.

In general the core electrons of doublet states of the
the 1s2 conﬁguration, are well de-
lithium atom, i.e.
scribed by functions optimized for the Li+ 110+ state.
Therefore we applied a two-particle optimization pro-
cedure to functions with the one-particle symmetries
mπz = 0+ and mπz = 0−. Further orbitals involved
in the calculation of the doublet states of the lithium
atom are obtained by optimizing orbitals for the hydro-
gen atom Z = 1.

For the fully spin-polarized quartet states, the situa-
tion is diﬀerent. Electrons are much less correlated and
therefore the computationally demanding two-particle
optimizations are not truely necessary. Core electrons,
i.e. mπz = 0+ and mπz = 0− are described by functions
optimized for Li2+, energetically higher orbitals such as
mπz = (±1)+, mπz = (±1)− are taken from basis sets
optimized for Z = 2, others from basis sets optimized for
Z = 1.

Typically the one-particle basis sets consist of approxi-
mately 100 Gaussian functions, which give rise to 8 000 –
40 000 three-electron slater-determinants, depending on
the addressed symmetry subspace. Very sophisticated al-
gorithms allow to calculate the full Hamiltonian matrix
eﬃciently. We exploit the fact, that the Hamiltonian ma-
trix is a sparse and symmetric one and apply a Lanczos
algorithm for its diagonalization.

IV. TOTAL AND IONIZATION ENERGIES

A. Total energies and global ground states

with diﬀerent symmetries represent the ground state of
the system. Therefore the global ground state of an
atom or ion experiences a series of crossovers. These
crossovers emerge to the delicate interplay between the
diﬀerent terms of the Hamiltonian in the ﬁeld such as the
spin Zeeman, diamagnetic and Coulomb interaction. Of
particular importance are here the magnetically tightly
bound orbitals that represent a key ingredient of strongly
bound atomic or ionic states in strong ﬁelds. The number
of ground state crossovers for a certain atom or ion in the
ﬁeld cannot be predicted e.g. on the grounds of symme-
try reasoning but has to determined through electronic
structure calculations in the presence of the ﬁeld. The
above holds in particular for the lithium atom considered
here.

The total energies of the components of the global elec-
tronic ground state for lithium as a function of the ﬁeld
strength are depicted in Fig. 1. For γ = 0 and in the low
ﬁeld regime 0 < γ ≤ 0.1929 the state 120+ represents
It is a doubly tightly bound state,
the ground state.
i.e.
it involves two tightly bound orbitals of 1s charac-
ter (although we are employing full CI calculations here,
we will occasionally use the mean-ﬁeld (HF) orbital no-
tation to elucidate the character of the fully correlated
atomic wave function). For doublet states (Sz = −1/2),
the total energy decreases for weak ﬁelds, due to the spin
Zeeman-term, and it increases for strong ﬁelds, which is a
consequence of the predominance of the increasing (posi-
tive deﬁnite) kinetic energy. For the 120+ state the total
energy passes through a minimum at γ ≈ 0.304 a.u. In
the intermediate ﬁeld regime (0.1929 ≤ γ ≤ 2.210) the
ground state of the lithium atom is represented by the
triply tightly bound state 12(−1)+, which contains in
particular the dominant 1s22p−1 conﬁguration. Fig. 1
shows, that the total energy of this state also passes
through a minimum, which is at higher ﬁeld strengths
(γ ≈ 1.466), compared to the position of the minimum
of the low ﬁeld ground state. The total energy of the
triply tightly bound quartet state 14(−3)+, which repre-
sents the ground state of the lithium atom for high ﬁeld
strengths (γ > 2.210), is dominated by the spin Zeeman-
term (Sz = −3/2). This results in a monotonously de-
creasing total energy.

Our values for the ﬁeld strengths corresponding to the
crossovers of the global ground state deviate about 10%
from previously published values for the ﬁrst crossover
and approximately 3% for the second crossover. Ivanov
(HF calculations) [27] states for the ﬁrst crossing ﬁeld
γ 0.17633 and Guan (modiﬁed full core plus correlation
method) 0.1753 [30]. The ﬁeld strength belonging to the
second crossover is found by Ivanov at γ = 2.153 com-
pared to our value of 2.210.

The symmetries of the global ground states of individ-
ual atoms or ions change depending on the ﬁeld strength
[27, 28, 37, 38, 39]: In diﬀerent ﬁeld regimes eigenstates

In order to calculate one-particle binding energies the
ionization threshold has to be deﬁned. In the following,

we will deﬁne one-particle ionization as a process, that
brings one electron to inﬁnity and thereby conserving all
quantum numbers of the atomic state. The one-particle
ionization threshold ET (M, Sz) for a state with magnetic
quantum number M and z projection Sz of the total spin
is deﬁned in the following way:

(M2, Sz2) are the total en-
ergies of the Li+ ion and the electron, respectively, de-
pending on their magnetic quantum numbers Mi and

numbers for the electron M2 and Sz2 can be expressed in
terms of the ionic and the atomic quantum numbers

M2 = M − M1

Sz2 = Sz − Sz1.

(8)

This procedure has to be repeated for each symmetry
and ﬁeld strength in order to identify the corresponding
threshold. Therefore several energy levels of Li+ have to
be considered as a function of the ﬁeld strength. Table I
shows the total energies for the Li+ states, associated to
one-particle ionization thresholds.

In the following, we will present our results for the to-
tal energies and the one-particle ionization energies for a
variety of states of the lithium atom with diﬀerent sym-
metries.

C. The symmetry subspace 20+

We present in Fig. 2 the one-particle ionization en-
ergies for the ν20+ states (ν = 1, 2, 3, 4), and in ta-
ble II numerical values for the corresponding total en-
ergies, one-particle ionization energies, including previ-
ously published data for the total energies. The ion-
ization threshold for these and for all other considered
doublet states, is associated with the Li+ state 110+.

TABLE I: Total energies for Li+ associated to one-particle
ionization thresholds at diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths for the con-
sidered lithium states.

The energetically lowest of the states in the 20+ symme-
try subspace, represents as mentioned above the global
ground state of the atom for low magnetic ﬁeld strengths.
Comparing the total energies to the previously published
data, shows, that the relative accuracy for γ = 0 for the
ground state is 4 · 10−5, 5 · 10−4 for the state 220+, and
4 · 10−3 for the 320+ state. For ﬁnite ﬁeld strengths our
results are signiﬁcantly below the Hartree-Fock results
[26, 27] and at least for γ ≥ 0.1 below the correlated
results of Guan [30].

FIG. 2: One-particle ionization energies for the states ν 20+
(ν = 1, 2, 3, 4) as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength γ.

In Fig. 2 it can be seen, that the one-particle ioniza-
tion energy of the ground state only weakly depends on
the ﬁeld strength. For a vanishing ﬁeld it amounts to
0.20058 a.u., whereas at a ﬁeld strength of γ = 10 it is
0.25310 a.u. It increases for weak to intermediate ﬁeld
strengths and possesses a maximum in the intermediate
ﬁeld regime. A similar statement holds for the ﬁrst ex-
cited state of this symmetry subspace, i.e. for the state

220+. The one-particle ionization energies for the states
320+ and 420+ exhibit a more pronounced dependence
on the ﬁeld strength. This is especially true in the inter-
mediate ﬁeld regime, where an avoided crossing between
the 220+, 320+ and 420+ occurs.

D. The symmetry subspace ν 2(−1)+

The ground state of the symmetry subspace 2(−1)+
represents the global ground state of the lithium atom
in the intermediate ﬁeld regime.
It is a triply tightly
bound state beeing predominantly described by the or-
bitals 1s22p−1. Therefore its one-particle ionization en-
ergy increases much more rapidly with increasing ﬁeld
strength, than the corresponding energy of the low ﬁeld
ground state 120+. This is shown in Fig. 3 and numeri-
cal values for the states ν2(−1)+ (ν = 1, 2, 3, 4) are listed
in Tab. III. Compared to the accurate, zero ﬁeld results
of Sims [43], it can be seen, that the relative accuracy
for the states 12(−1)+, 22(−1)+, and 32(−1)+ is about
4 ·10−4. For ﬁnite ﬁelds the comparison of the total ener-
gies for the 12(−1)+ state is as follows: our energies are
signiﬁcantly below the Hf energies [27], for γ < 0.5 above
[30] and for for γ ≥ 0.5
the correlated results in Ref.
below them.

Furthermore the table III shows,

that the state
12(−1)+ becomes for γ ≥ 0.2 the most tightly bound
the state with the highest one-particle ion-
state, i.e.
ization energy. This holds even for high ﬁelds, although
there the quartet states have a much lower total energy.
For the state 12(−1)+ the one-particle ionization energy
increases about more than one order of magnitude in the
considered ﬁeld range: 0.129935 a.u. at zero magnetic
ﬁeld, and 1.530623 a.u. at γ = 10.

γ = 10 it becomes 0.19525 a.u. and therefore increases
almost by a factor of 4. For the higher excited states
32(−1)+ and 42(−1)+ the eﬀect of an avoided crossing
can be observd. Therefore the one-particle ionization
energies of these states show a more complex behavior.
As a result their ionization energy increases from γ = 0
to γ = 10 to a much lower extent, than the ionization
energy for the ground and the ﬁrst excited state.

E. The symmetry subspace 4(−1)+

Our results for the symmetry subspace 4(−1)+ are pre-
sented in Fig. 4 and in table IV. The spin Zeeman-term
causes the total energies of all these fully spin polarized
quartet states, to decrease monotonously. On the other
hand, this is not reﬂected by the one-particle ionization
energies, which increase or decrease weakly. The ground
state 14(−1)+ is a doubly tightly bound state predomi-
nantly consisting of the conﬁguration 1s2s2p−1. An in-
crease of the one-particle ionization energy can be ob-
served in the ﬁeld regime γ < 0.2, which is similar to the
increase in the ionization energy for the triply tightly
bound state 12(−1)+. However,
in the ﬁeld regime
γ ≥ 0.5 the ionization energy of the state 14(−1)+ de-
creases. The reason for this are diﬀerent one-particle
ionization thresholds in the diﬀerent ﬁeld regimes. For
weak ﬁeld strengths the ionization threshold involves the
Li+ state 130+, which is a singly tightly bound state,
whereas for γ > 0.2 it is the 13(−1)+ state of the Li+ ion
which is a doubly tightly bound state.

impressive for the state 44(−1)+, for which the ionization

one order of magnitude to 0.006859 a.u. at γ = 10.

F. The symmetry subspace ν 4(−1)−

In this subsection we will review the results for the
quartet states with magnetic quantum number M = −1
and negative z-parity, i.e. ν4(−1)− (ν = 1, 2, 3, 4). In
the low ﬁeld regime (γ < 0.1) all the curves in Fig.
5 behave similary: we observe a signiﬁcant increase of
the ionization energies for all considered states of this
symmetry subspace. At higher ﬁeld strengths the ener-
gies develop diﬀerently for the diﬀerent states. The one-
particle ionization energy of the state 14(−1)− increases
monotonously. The ionization energies of the higher ex-

cited states 24(−1)−, 34(−1)− and 44(−1)− reach a lo-
cal maximum for 0.1 < γ < 1. At higher ﬁeld strengths
(γ > 1) we observe, that the one-particle ionization en-
ergies for these states become nearly ﬁeld independent.

Table V contains the corresponding numerical val-
ues. For this symmetry subspace a crossover for the Li+
threshold state can be observed, as for the 4(−1)+ sub-
space, discussed in the previous subsection.

G. The symmetry subspace ν 2(−2)+

In this subsection, we present our results for the
2(−2)+ symmetry subspace. Figure 6 shows the curves

FIG. 5: One-particle ionization energy for the states ν 4(−1)−

strength γ.

for the one-particle ionization energy and table VI con-
tains the numerical results for the total energies, one-
particle ionization energies as well as previously pub-

lished data. The ground state of this symmetry 12(−2)+
is a triply tightly bound state. Therefore the one-particle
ionization energy increases monotonously. For this state
the increase amounts to more than one order of magni-
tude in the considered range of ﬁeld strengths. At zero
ﬁeld it is 0.0554 a.u. and at γ = 10 1.017 a.u., i.e. an
increase by approximately a factor of 20.

For the ﬁrst excited state of this symmetry (22(−2)+)
we observe in Fig. 6 an increase, which is less pronounced
than for the ground state of the same symmetry. We
obtain for its one-particle ionization energy at vanishing
ﬁeld 0.031106 a.u. and at the highest considered ﬁeld
strength (γ = 10) 0.172684 a.u., which corresponds to an
increase of a factor 5.

For the two higher excited states of this symmetry
(32(−2)+ and 42(−2)+) the situation is diﬀerent. In the
intermediate ﬁeld regime again avoided crossings take
place. Therefore their one-particle ionization energies
pass through local minima at γ ≈ 0.1 (32(−2)+) and
γ ≈ 0.2 (42(−2)+) respectively.

respectively. We remark, that there are no prevoiusly
calculated data on states of the 4(−2)+ symmetry in the
literature.

H. The symmetry subspace ν 4(−2)+

For the corresponding quadruplet subspace 4(−2)+ the
ionization energies are shown in Fig. 7 and numerical
values are given in table VII. The behavior of the one-
particle ionization energies is diﬀerent compared to the
corresponding behavior of the doublet states presented
in the previous subsection. At low ﬁelds (γ < 0.05) an
increase can be observed for all states considered in this
work. For the ground state 14(−2)+ the one-particle ion-
ization energy increases from 0.06017 a.u. at γ = 0 to
0.190927 a.u. at γ = 0.2, where it reaches a local max-
imum. At this ﬁeld strength the ionization threshold
changes, as for the other quadruplet states. Consequently
the ionization energy decreases and passes through a lo-
cal minimum at γ ≈ 1. At γ ≈ 0.5 an avoided cross-
ing occurs, which leads to an increase of the one-particle
ionization energy for the state 14(−2)+ for higher ﬁeld
strengths. On the other hand, the corresponding energy
for the state 24(−2)+ which increases for γ & 0.5 acquires

I. The symmetry subspace ν 4(−3)+

Let us discuss our results for the symmetry subspace
2S+1M Πz =4 (−3)+. The energetically lowest state in
this subspace represents the global ground state of the
lithium atom in the high ﬁeld regime, as mentioned
above. It is a triply tightly bound state containing a.o.
the orbitals 1s2p−13d−2. In Fig. 8 it can be seen, that
its one-particle ionization energy increases strongly as a
function of the ﬁeld strength. At zero magnetic ﬁeld
it is about 0.03164 a.u., whereas at γ = 10 an energy

the one-particle ionization energy increases roughly by a
factor of 40. However, if the reader compares the one-
particle ionization energies in table VIII with table III,
it is evident that the state 14(−3)+ is not the state with
the highest ionization energy for any ﬁeld strength.

FIG. 8: One-particle ionization energy for the states ν 4(−3)+
(ν = 1, 2, 3, 4) in a.u. as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength γ.

The ionization energies for the excited states 24(−3)+,
34(−3)+ and 44(−3)+ behave all very similar. Their ion-
ization energy increases up to γ ≈ 0.5, where a local
maximum is reached. For 0.5 & γ & 2 the ionization
energy decreases, whereas for higher ﬁeld strengths it in-
creases again with a lower slope than for γ < 0.5. Our
numerical energy values for the 14(−3)+ state are always
lower than the energies obtained in the literature (see
table VIII and Refs. [27, 28]).

V. WAVELENGTHS FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC
TRANSITIONS

In this section we present the results for the wave-
lengths λ of the allowed electric dipole transitions. We
will restrict the wavelengths to the regime λ < 105 ˚A in
order to avoid too large uncertainties. In the following we
will consider the linear polarized transition ν4(−1)+ −→
µ4(−1)− (ν, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4) (shown in Fig. 9) and the cir-
cular polarized transitions ν2S+1M + −→ µ2S+1(M −1)−
(ν, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4) for (M, S)=(0, 2), (−1, 2), (−1, 4), and
(−2, 4) in Figs. 10 to 13.

First, we discuss some general features of the tran-
sition wavelengths. For the circular polarized transi-
tions (M, S)=(0, 2), (−1, 2), and (−2, 4) (presented in
Figs. 10, 11, and 13) it can be observed, that some tran-
sition wavelengths decrease in the limit of a strong ﬁeld,
thereby following a power law. Whereas for the lin-
ear polarized transition (Fig. 9), and the circular po-
larized transition (M, S)=(−1, 4) (Fig. 12) such a be-
havior can not be observed. The transitions, with the
strongly decreasing wavelengths are the ones, which in-
volve triply tightly bound states. In our case these are the
states 120+, 12(−1)+, 12(−2)+ and 14(−3)+. The cor-
responding wavelengths become for γ = 10 shorter than
103 ˚A, whereas the remaining transition wavelengths are
in general longer than 103 ˚A. In the symmetry sub-
spaces, involved for the linear polarized transitions con-
sidered here, and the circular polarized transitions with
(M, S)=(−1, 4), no triply tightly bound states exist.

For the linear polarized transitions ν4(−1)+ −→
µ4(−1)− (ν, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4) shown in Fig. 9 it can be
observed, that the wavelengths in the low ﬁeld regime
(γ < 0.1) are nearly constant. In the regime 0.1 ≤ γ ≤ 5
the spectrum of wavelengths becomes very complicated.
This is due to avoided crossings of excited states being
present in both symmetry subspaces, that are involved
in the transitions. Especially we ﬁnd divergences of the
transition wavelengths, being a consequence of crossovers
of the energy levels.

In Fig. 10 the transition wavelengths for the circular

For the case of the circular polarized doublet transi-
tions ν2(−1)+ −→ µ2(−2)+ (ν, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4), displayed
in Fig. 11, the reader observes eight lines, decreasing in
the limit of strong ﬁelds thereby following a power law.
These lines correspond to the transitions involving the
triply tightly bound states 12(−1)+ and 12(−2)+. Fur-

thermore the reader should note, that the transitions
among the other states show little variation, compared
to the transitions ν20+ −→ µ2(−1)+, which is a con-
sequence of the fact, that the energy levels in the par-
ticipating symmetry subspaces behave in a very similar
way.

1, 2, 3, 4) shown in Fig. 13 one observes some very short
transition wavelengths at γ = 10 (λ < 400 ˚A), that cor-
respond to transitions involving the high ﬁeld ground
state 14(−3)+, which is a triply tightly bound state. For
γ > 0.1 avoided crossings and the rearrangement of en-
ergy levels creates a complex pattern.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we have investigated the electronic
structure of the lithium atom exposed to a strong homo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld. We cover the broad regime of
ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ γ ≤ 10 providing data for a grid of
ten values for the ﬁeld strength. The key ingredient of our
computational method is an anisotropic Gaussian basis
set whose nonlinear variational parameters (exponents!)
are optimized for each ﬁeld strength. These nonlinear
optimizations, being based on a sophisticated algorith-
mic procedure, are performed for one- and two-electron
atomic systems in the presence of the ﬁeld. As a result
we obtain a basis set of orbitals that allows for a rapidly
convergent numerical study of the electronic structure of,
in particular, the lithium atom.

Our computational approach to the three-electron
problem is a full conﬁguration interaction method. This
approach yields fully correlated wave functions that can,
in principle, be determined to arbitrary accuracy. To im-
plement it for the above-mentioned basis set a number of
techniques had to be combined. To avoid linear depen-
dencies of our non-orthogonal orbitals a cut-oﬀ technique
with respect to the overlap and Hamiltonian conﬁgura-
tion matrix has been employed. Employing large conﬁg-
urational basis sets of the order of several ten-thousand
we arrived at relative accuracies of the order of 10−4 for
the total energies of the lithium atom in the presence of
the ﬁeld.

The ground state crossovers of the lithium atom with

ing more precise values for the crossover ﬁeld strengths.
A classiﬁcation and discussion of the one-electron ioniza-
tion energies for the ground and excited states for each
of the above-given symmetries has been provided. Par-
ticular emphasis has been given to the eﬀects due to the
tightly bound orbitals and the singly or multiply tightly
bound conﬁgurations. Only a very limited number of
states show a monotonically increasing one-electron ion-

ization energy in the complete regime of ﬁeld strengths
considered here. With increasing degree of excitation
avoided crossings lead to a nonmonotonous behavior of
the energies. For the electromagnetic transitions that in-
volve states with tightly bound orbitals we observe bun-
dles of short wavelengths that decrease monotonically

with increasing ﬁeld strength.

In principle our approach allows investigations of more
than three electron atoms. Furthermore since it yields
the eigenfunctions arbitrary properties and in particular
oscillator strengths for lithium and more electron atoms
can be obtained.

Abstract. We present two new measurements constraining Lorentz and CPT viola-
tion using the 129Xe/3He Zeeman maser and atomic hydrogen masers. Experimental
investigations of Lorentz and CPT symmetry provide important tests of the frame-
work of the standard model of particle physics and theories of gravity. The two-species
129Xe/3He Zeeman maser bounds violations of CPT and Lorentz symmetry of the neu-
tron at the 10−31 GeV level. Measurements with atomic hydrogen masers provide a
clean limit of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation of the proton at the 10−27 GeV
level.

INTRODUCTION

Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental feature of modern descriptions of nature.
Lorentz transformations include both spatial rotations and boosts. Therefore,
experimental investigations of rotation symmetry provide important tests of the
framework of the standard model of particle physics and single-metric theories of
gravity [1].

In particular, the minimal SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) standard model successfully de-
scribes particle phenomenology, but is believed to be the low energy limit of a
more fundamental theory that incorporates gravity. While the fundamental theory
should remain invariant under Lorentz transformations, spontaneous symmetry-
breaking could result at the level of the standard model in violations of local
Lorentz invariance (LLI) and CPT (symmetry under simultaneous application of
Charge conjugation, Parity inversion, and Time reversal) [2].

Clock comparisons provide sensitive tests of rotation invariance and hence
Lorentz symmetry by bounding the frequency variation of a given clock as its
orientation changes, e.g., with respect to the ﬁxed stars [3]. In practice, the most
precise limits are obtained by comparing the frequencies of two co-located clocks

FIGURE 1. Bounds on LLI and CPT violation can be obtained by comparing the frequencies of
clocks as they rotate with respect to the ﬁxed stars. The standard model extension described in
[3,9–17] admits Lorentz-violating couplings of noble gas nuclei and hydrogen atoms to expectation
values of tensor ﬁelds.
(Some of these couplings also violate CPT.) Each of the tensor ﬁelds
may have an unknown magnitude and orientation in space, to be limited by experiment. The
background arrows in this ﬁgure illustrate one such ﬁeld.

as they rotate with the Earth (see Fig. 1). Atomic clocks are typically used, in-
volving the electromagnetic signals emitted or absorbed on hyperﬁne or Zeeman
transitions.

We report results from two new atomic clock tests of LLI and CPT:

(1) Using a two-species 129Xe/3He Zeeman maser [4–6] we placed a limit on CPT
and LLI violation of the neutron of nearly 10−31 GeV, improving by more than
a factor of six on the best previous measurement [7,8].

(2) We employed atomic hydrogen masers to set an improved clean limit on

LLI/CPT violation of the proton, at the level of nearly 10−27 GeV.

MOTIVATION

Our atomic clock comparisons are motivated by a standard model extension
developed by Kosteleck´y and others [3,9–17]. This theoretical framework accom-
modates possible spontaneous violation of local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and CPT
symmetry, which may occur in a fundamental theory combining the standard model
with gravity. For example, this might occur in string theory [18]. The standard

model extension is quite general: it emerges as the low-energy limit of any under-
lying theory that generates the standard model and contains spontaneous Lorentz
symmetry violation [19]. The extension retains the usual gauge structure and
power-counting renormalizability of the standard model. It also has many other
desirable properties, including energy-momentum conservation, observer Lorentz
covariance, conventional quantization, and hermiticity. Microcausality and energy
positivity are expected.

This well-motivated theoretical framework suggests that small, low-energy signals
of LLI and CPT violation may be detectable in high-precision experiments. The
dimensionless suppression factor for such eﬀects would likely be the ratio of the
low-energy scale to the Planck scale, perhaps combined with dimensionless coupling
constants [3,9–19]. A key feature of the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y
et al. is that it is at the level of the known elementary particles, and thus enables
quantitative comparison of a wide array of tests of Lorentz symmetry. In recent
work the standard model extension has been used to quantify bounds on LLI and
CPT violation from measurements of neutral meson oscillations [9]; tests of QED
in Penning traps [10]; photon birefringence in the vacuum [11,12]; baryogenesis
[13]; hydrogen and antihydrogen spectroscopy [14]; experiments with muons [15];
a spin-polarized torsion pendulum [16]; observations with cosmic rays [17]; and
atomic clock comparisons [3]. Recent experimental work motivated by this standard
model extension includes Penning trap tests by Gabrielse et al. on the antiproton
and H− [20], and by Dehmelt et al. on the electron and positron [21,22], which place
improved limits on CPT and LLI violation in these systems. Also, a re-analysis by
Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, and co-workers of existing data from the “E¨ot-Wash
II” spin-polarized torsion pendulum [23,24] sets the most stringent bound to date
on CPT and LLI violation of the electron: approximately 10−28 GeV [25].

129XE/3HE MASER TEST OF CPT AND LORENTZ

SYMMETRY

The design and operation of the two-species 129Xe/3He maser has been discussed
in recent publications [4–6]. (See the schematic in Fig. 2.) Two dense, co-located
ensembles of 3He and 129Xe atoms perform continuous and simultaneous maser os-
cillations on their respective nuclear spin 1/2 Zeeman transitions at approximately
4.9 kHz for 3He and 1.7 kHz for 129Xe in a static magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 gauss. This
two-species maser operation can be maintained indeﬁnitely. The population inver-
sion for both maser ensembles is created by spin exchange collisions between the
noble gas atoms and optically-pumped Rb vapor [26]. The 129Xe/3He maser has
two chambers, one acting as the spin exchange “pump bulb” and the other serving
as the “maser bulb”. This two chamber conﬁguration permits the combination of
physical conditions necessary for a high ﬂux of spin-polarized noble gas atoms into
the maser bulb, while also maintaining 3He and 129Xe maser oscillations with good
frequency stability: ∼ 100 nHz stability is typical for measurement intervals of ∼ 1

hour [6]. (A single-bulb 129Xe/3He maser does not provide good frequency stability
because of the large Fermi contact shift of the 129Xe Zeeman frequency caused by
129Xe-Rb collisions [27].) Either of the noble gas species can serve as a precision
magnetometer to stabilize the system’s static magnetic ﬁeld, while the other species
is employed as a sensitive probe for LLI- and CPT-violating interactions or other
subtle physical inﬂuences. (For example, we are also using the 129Xe/3He maser to
search for a permanent electric dipole moment of 129Xe as a test of time reversal
symmetry; hence the electric ﬁeld plates in Fig. 2.)

We search for a signature of Lorentz violation by monitoring the relative phases
and Zeeman frequencies of the co-located 3He and 129Xe masers as the laboratory
reference frame rotates with respect to the ﬁxed stars. We operate the system with
the quantization axis directed east-west on the Earth, the 3He maser free-running,
and the 129Xe maser phase-locked to a signal derived from a hydrogen maser in order
to stabilize the magnetic ﬁeld. To leading order, the standard model extension of
Kosteleck´y et al. predicts that the Lorentz-violating frequency shifts for the 3He
and 129Xe maser are the same size and sign [3]. Hence the possible Lorentz-violating
frequency shift in the free-running 3He maser (δνHe) is given by:

δνHe = δνLorentz [γHe/γXe − 1] ,

(1)

where δνLorentz is the sidereal-day-period modulation induced in both noble gas
Zeeman frequencies by the Lorentz-violating interaction, and γHe/γXe ≈ 2.75 is the
ratio of gyromagnetic ratios for 3He and 129Xe.

We acquired 90 days of data for this experiment over the period April, 1999
to April, 2000. We reversed the main magnetic ﬁeld of the apparatus every ∼ 4
days to help distinguish possible Lorentz-violating eﬀects from diurnal system-

removed, and the best-ﬁt sinusoid curve (with sidereal-day-period) is displayed

day evolved about 2π radians over the course of the experiment; hence diurnal
systematic eﬀects from any source would be reduced by averaging the results from
the measurement sets.

We analyzed each day’s data and determined the amplitude and phase of a
possible sidereal-day-period variation in the free-running 3He maser frequency. (See
Fig. 3 for an example of one day’s data.) We employed a linear least squares method
to ﬁt the free-running maser phase vs. time using a minimal model including: a
constant (phase oﬀset); a linear term (Larmor precession); and cosine and sine terms
with sidereal day period. For each day’s data, we included terms corresponding to
quadratic and maser amplitude-induced phase drift if they signiﬁcantly improved
the reduced χ2 [28]. As a ﬁnal check, we added a faux Lorentz-violating eﬀect
of known phase and amplitude to the raw data and performed the analysis as
before. We considered our data reduction for a given sidereal day to be successful
if the synthetic physics was recovered and there was no signiﬁcant change in the
covariance matrix generated by the ﬁtting routine.

Using the 90 days of data, we found no statistically signiﬁcant sidereal variation of
the free-running 3He maser frequency at the level of 90 nHz (two-sigma conﬁdence).
Kosteleck´y and Lane report that the nuclear Zeeman transitions of 129Xe and 3He
are primarily sensitive to Lorentz-violating couplings of the neutron, assuming the
correctness of the Schmidt model of the nuclei [3]. Thus our search for a sidereal-
period frequency shift of the free-running 3He maser (δνHe) provides a bound to
the following parameters characterizing the magnitude of LLI/CPT violations in
the standard model extension:

ferent linear combinations of fundamental parameters in the underlying relativistic

It is clear from Eqn. (2) that the 129Xe/3He clock comparison is primarily sensitive
to LLI/CPT violations associated with the neutron parameter ˜bn
J . Similarly, the
most precise previous search for LLI/CPT violations of the neutron, the 199Hg/133Cs
experiment of Lamoreaux, Hunter et al. [7,8], also had principal sensitivity to ˜bn
at the following level [3]:

(3)

In this case, the experimental limit, δνHg ,J , was a bound of 110 nHz (two-sigma
conﬁdence) on a sidereal-period variation of the 199Hg nuclear Zeeman frequency,
with the 133Cs electronic Zeeman frequency serving as a co-magnetometer.

Therefore, in the context of the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y and
co-workers [3], our 129Xe/3He maser measurement improves the constraint on
˜bn
J to nearly 10−31 GeV, or more than six times better than the 199Hg/133Cs
clock comparison [7,8]. Note that the ratio of this limit to the neutron mass
(10−31GeV/mn ∼ 10−31) compares favorably to the dimensionless suppression fac-
tor mn/MPlanck ∼ 10−19 that might be expected to govern spontaneous symmetry
breaking of LLI and CPT originating at the Planck scale. We expect more than
an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to LLI/CPT–violation of the
neutron using a new device recently demonstrated in our laboratory: the 21Ne/3He
Zeeman maser.

HYDROGEN MASER TEST OF CPT AND LORENTZ

SYMMETRY

The hydrogen maser is an established tool in precision tests of fundamental
physics [29]. Hydrogen masers operate on the ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne
transition in the ground state of atomic hydrogen [30]. Hydrogen molecules are
dissociated into atoms in an RF discharge, and the atoms are state selected via a
hexapole magnet (Fig. 4). The high ﬁeld seeking states, (F = 1, mF = +1, 0) are
focused into a Teﬂon coated cell which resides in a microwave cavity resonant with
the ∆F = 1 transition at 1420 MHz. The F = 1, mF = 0 atoms are stimulated to

make a transition to the F = 0 state by the ﬁeld of the cavity. A static magnetic
ﬁeld of ∼ 1 milligauss is applied to maintain the quantization axis of the H atoms.
The hydrogen transitions most sensitive to potential CPT and LLI violations are
the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman transitions. In the 0.6 mG static ﬁeld applied for
these measurements, the Zeeman frequency is νZ ≈ 850 Hz. We utilize a double
resonance technique to measure this frequency with a precision of ∼ 1 mHz [31].
We apply a weak magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the static ﬁeld and oscillating at a
frequency close to the Zeeman transition. This audio-frequency driving ﬁeld couples
the three sublevels of the F = 1 manifold of the H atoms. Provided a population
diﬀerence exists between the mF = ±1 states, the energy of the mF = 0 state is
altered by this coupling, thus shifting the measured maser frequency in a carefully
analyzed manner [31] described by a dispersive shape (Fig. 5(a)).
Importantly,
the maser frequency is unchanged when the driving ﬁeld is exactly equal to the
Zeeman frequency. Therefore, we determine the Zeeman frequency by measuring
the driving ﬁeld frequency at which the maser frequency in the presence of the
driving ﬁeld is equal to the unperturbed maser frequency.

The F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency is directly proportional to the static
magnetic ﬁeld, in the small-ﬁeld limit. Four layers of high permeability (µ-metal)
magnetic shields surround the maser (Fig. 4), screening external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
by a factor of 32 000. Nevertheless, external magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations cause rem-
nant variations in the observed Zeeman frequency. As low frequency magnetic noise
in the neighborhood of this experiment is much larger during the day than late at
night, the measured Zeeman frequency could be preferentially shifted by this noise
(at levels up to ∼ 0.5 Hz) with a 24 hour periodicity which is diﬃcult to distinguish

from a true sidereal signal in our relatively short data sample. Therefore, we employ
an active stabilization system to cancel such magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (Fig. 4).
A ﬂuxgate magnetometer placed as close to the maser cavity as possible controls
large (2.4 m dia.) Helmholtz coils surrounding the maser via a feedback loop to
maintain a constant ambient ﬁeld. This feedback loop reduces the ﬂuctuations at
the sidereal frequency to below the equivalent of 1 µHz on the Zeeman frequency
at the location of the magnetometer.

The Zeeman frequency of a hydrogen maser was measured for ∼ 31 days over the
period Nov., 1999 to March, 2000. During data taking, the maser remained in a
closed, temperature controlled room to reduce potential systematics from thermal
drifts which might be expected to have 24 hour periodicities. The feedback system
also maintained a constant ambient magnetic ﬁeld. Each Zeeman measurement
took approximately 20 minutes to acquire and was subsequently ﬁt to extract a
Zeeman frequency (Fig. 5(a)). Also monitored were maser amplitude, residual
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation, ambient temperature, and current through the solenoidal
coil which determines the Zeeman frequency (Fig. 4).

The data were then ﬁt to extract the sidereal-period sinusoidal variation of the
Zeeman frequency. (See Fig. 5(b) for an example of 11 days of data.) In addition
to the sinusoid, piecewise linear terms (whose slopes were allowed to vary inde-
pendently for each day) were used to model the slow remnant drift of the Zeeman
frequency. No signiﬁcant sidereal-day-period variation of the hydrogen F = 1,
∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency was observed. Our measurements set a bound on
the magnitude of such a variation of δνH
Z ≤ 0.3 mHz. Expressed in terms of energy,
this is a shift in the Zeeman splitting of less than 1 · 10−27 GeV.

and the electron. Following the notation of reference [14], one ﬁnds that a limit on
a sidereal-day-period modulation of the Zeeman frequency (δνH
Z ) provides a bound
to the following parameters characterizing the magnitude of LLI/CPT violations
in the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y and co-workers:

(Again, we have taken
¯h = c = 1.) The terms be and bp describe the strength of background tensor ﬁeld
couplings that violate CPT and LLI while the H and d terms describe couplings
that violate LLI but not CPT [14]. The subscript 3 in Eqn. (4) indicates the
direction along the quantization axis of the apparatus, which is vertical in the lab
frame but rotates with respect to the ﬁxed stars with the period of the sidereal day.
As in refs. [3,21], we can re-express the time varying change in the hydrogen

KL, J = X, Y refers to non-rotating spatial indices
in the plane perpendicular to the rotation vector of the earth, w refers to either
the proton or electron parameters, and χ = 42◦ is the latitude of the experiment.
As noted above, a re-analysis by Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, and co-workers
of existing data from the “E¨ot-Wash II” spin-polarized torsion pendulum [23,24]
sets the most stringent bound to date on CPT and LLI violation of the electron:
˜be
J ≤ 10−28 GeV [25]. Therefore, in the context of the standard model extension of
Kosteleck´y and co-workers [14,3] the H maser measurement to date constrains LLI
and CPT violations of the proton parameter ˜bp
J ≤ 2 · 10−27 GeV at the one sigma
level. This limit is comparable to that derived from the 199Hg/133Cs experiment of
Lamoreaux, Hunter et al. [7,8] but in a much cleaner system (the hydrogen atom
nucleus is a proton, compared to the complicated nuclei of 199Hg and 133Cs).

CONCLUSIONS

Precision comparisons of atomic clocks provide sensitive tests of Lorentz and
CPT symmetries, thereby probing extensions to the standard model [3,9–17] in
which these symmetries can be spontaneously broken. Measurements using the
two-species 129Xe/3He Zeeman maser constrain violations of CPT and Lorentz sym-
metry of the neutron at the 10−31 GeV level. Measurements with atomic hydrogen
masers provide clean tests of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation of the proton
at the 10−27 GeV level. Improvements in both experiments are being pursued.

We study the evolution of a trapped atomic cloud subject to a trapping frequency jump for two

cases: stationary and moving center of mass. In the ﬁrst case, the frequency jump initiates oscilla-

tions in the cloud’s momentum and size. At certain times we ﬁnd the temperature is signiﬁcantly

reduced. When the oscillation amplitude becomes large enough, local density increases induced by

the anharmonicity of the trapping potential are observed. In the second case, the oscillations are

coupled to the center of mass motion through the anharmonicity of the potential. This induces

oscillations with even larger amplitudes, enhancing the temperature reduction eﬀects and leading

to nonisotropic expansion rates while expanding freely.

INTRODUCTION

A trapped atomic cloud subjected to a sudden change in its trapping potential can ex-

hibit a wide range of behavior with many possible applications. It can be used as a model

for studding fundamental phenomenon ranging from superﬂuidity to the generation of non-

classical states of a matter-wavepacket. For instance, a Bose-Einstein condensate can be

reversibly created by suddenly changing the trapping potential [1]; sinusoidally moving a

magnetic trap center can be used to observe the excitation modes of a Bose-Einstein con-

densate [2]; the modulation of optical traps can be used for coherent control of the center

of mass wavepacket [3]; and the breathing mode oscillation of atomic clouds in 1D and 3D

optical lattices can be realized by suddenly changing the lattice depth [4]. The later has also

captured a great deal of theoretical interest because of the possibility of creating squeezed

states of a matter wavepacket [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

The oscillation of an atomic cloud after a sudden jump in the trapping frequency has also

been proposed as a tool for optical cooling and hence controlling the onset of Bose-Einstein

condensation [12, 13]. This cooling method can be categorized among the techniques that

use geometrical manipulation of an external potential to reduce the temperature of atoms

or molecules. For example, Flories et al.

[14] used a spatially varying electric ﬁeld to

longitudinally cool a molecular beam to 250 nK, while Ketterle and coworkers achieved pico-

Kelvin temperatures by adiabatically decompressing a gravito-magnetic trap [15]. Exposing

a freely expanding cloud of cold atoms to a pulsed potential has also been considered as a

method for temperature reduction [16].

In this paper we use optical traps to experimentally realize a potential with a sudden

frequency jump so as to explore the cooling proposals of Ref.

[12]. These traps have

become versatile tools for atom optics research, with the observation of all-optical Bose

Einstein condensation an example of their dramatic potential [17]. Early experiments on

intensity modulation of the laser beam used to form an optical trap [4, 18, 19, 20] were

used to demonstrate the parametric excitation of an atomic cloud. In this paper we will

discuss experiments with these traps, comparing the observations with theory, and presenting

possible future applications. The format of this paper is as follows.

In Section II the

experimental conﬁguration is reviewed. In Section III we ﬁrst lay out the theory of non-

adiabatic cooling of an atomic cloud, then follow by presenting experimental data for the

2

case of a sudden frequency jump with a stationary center of mass. This discussion is then

repeated in Section IV for the case of a moving center of mass.

II. EXPERIMENTAL CONFIGURATION

Our experimental apparatus has been described previously [21, 22] so only a brief de-

scription is given here. We create a potential for Rb87 atoms using their interaction with

10.6 µm light from a CO2 laser. The CO2 laser radiation frequency is far enough below

that of the resonances of the atoms that its electric ﬁeld can be considered quasi-static.

This induces a dipole moment proportional to the local electric ﬁeld and a lowering of the
atomic ground state energy given by, U = − 1
2 αg|E|2, where αg is the ground state static
polarizability and |E|2 is the time averaged square of the laser light’s electric ﬁeld.

Two CO2 beams were directed into a vacuum chamber in a geometry such that they

propagated orthogonally to each other. One of the beams propagated in the vertical direction

(x direction) and the other in the horizontal direction (z direction). Crucially the position

where the x beam intersected the z beam could be adjusted. That is, the foci of the two

beams did not necessarily coincide. The light for these beams originated from a 50 Watt RF

excited CO2 laser whose total power was controlled by passing the output light through an

acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The ﬁrst order beam of the modulator was then directed

into another AOM which was used as a beamsplitter whose ratio could be changed by varying

the input RF power. This ratio was used to control the time dependent potential. In order

to fulﬁll the conditions necessary for this experiment, the CO2 beams were aligned such that

the x beam was the ﬁrst order of the second AOM and the z beam the zeroth order of the

same AOM. The data were taken by destructively imaging the cloud using a resonant probe

laser which passed through the atom cloud and was then incident on a CCD camera. A

gaussian ﬁt to the optical density data determined the spatial extent of the atomic cloud.

III. STATIONARY CENTER OF MASS

We begin by theoretically considering the situation where the center of mass of the atomic

cloud remains stationary after a sudden change in the trapping potential. We take a sample

of atoms in thermal equilibrium inside a harmonic potential of frequency ω0 which is non-

3

adiabatically changed to ω1 at t = 0. Neglecting the eﬀect of collisions and following Balatov

et al. [12], the momentum and position probability distribution widths are given by,

For ω1 ≪ ω0, a narrow momentum distribution is produced corresponding to a lower eﬀective

temperature. In the case of a single Gaussian laser beam propagating in the z direction the

average electric ﬁeld can be expressed as,

from a two beam to a one beam geometry will produce a signiﬁcant frequency change along

the z direction. The ratio of one and two beam frequencies is,

which is independent of the total laser power and is determined by the beam waist at

the focus. Since the temperature of the atomic cloud is proportional to the momentum

To explore this behavior experimentally we aligned the CO2 beams such that their foci

overlapped. Atoms were loaded into the potential minimum created by the intensity maxi-

mum located at the intersection of the beams. The power in the x beam was transferred to

the z beam by switching the RF power on the second AOM to zero. This abrupt transfer of

power mostly produced a change in the eﬀective frequency in the z direction and initiated

the oscillation of the trapped cloud. If the shift of power to the z beam happens immediately

after loading, the FORT will not produce the desired oscillation since the atomic density is
approximately 1014 atoms cm−3 and cold binary scattering dramatically aﬀects the evolution

of the cloud. Therefore the collisionless approximation of the previous section can not be

used. To move into the collisionless regime it is necessary to decrease the atomic density by

reducing the number of atoms before the power transfer. This is accomplished by reducing

the total power in the CO2 beams in order to carry out forced evaporation of hot atoms.

This reduces both the density of atoms in the trap and their temperature. This process is
carried out so that the atomic cloud which remains in the FORT has densities of around 1011
atoms cm−3. This guarantees that the mean free path of the individual particles is bigger

than the cloud size so that the evolution of the sample can be considered in the collisionless

regime.

After evaporative cooling the total power was transferred to the z beam and the cloud size

started to oscillate in the z direction. However, the time evolution of the cloud size did not

obey the simple periodic form predicted by Eq. (2). Our observations show that a domain

with high atomic density appears at the center of the trap periodically during the cloud’s

evolution . This structure is reminiscent of the two component structure which appears at

the onset of a degenerate Bose gas. Three cross sections of the cloud along the z-axis are

shown in Fig.1. Figure1 (a), (b) and (c) were taken 2, 5 and 10 ms after switching oﬀ the x

beam respectively. The total power in the CO2 beams was 5 Watts. A high density region

at the center of Fig. 1(b) is clearly visible. It disappears later in the evolution as seen in

Fig. 1(c). Creation of these high density regions is a direct result of the strong anharmonic

potential and is predicted in [13]. A Monte Carlo simulation of the anharmonic system can

reproduce this behavior for the cloud. Figure 2 presents the result of such a collisionless

calculation at the moment where the two component structure appears. The simulation was
carried out for 3 × 104 atoms initially at thermal equilibrium with a 25µm initial cloud size.

It is worth noting that the high density regions never appeared when harmonic potentials

were simulated.

The high density region makes the observed optical density proﬁles complex enough that

it is impossible to ﬁt a Gaussian function to the data and infer the width of the cloud.

Therefore to observe the oscillation of the cloud size, predicted by Eq. (2) we have reduced

the total power in the CO2 beams to 0.5 Watts. In this regime the cloud temperature is low

enough (below 2 µK) that the oscillation amplitude does not move the atoms away from

the region where the harmonic approximation of the potential is valid. Furthermore, as
mentioned above, the evaporative cooling also reduces the atomic density to ≈ 1011 atom
cm−3, suppressing the two-body collision rate. The time dependency of the cloud size for

this condition is given in Fig. 3. This shows that the cloud does not collapse to its original

extent during its evolution in the trap. We expect that this is the result of a small number

of collisions. According to this data the size of the cloud in the z direction expands to about

6 times its initial value. From Eq. (3) this implies a factor of 6 reduction in the width

of the momentum distribution or a factor of 36 in the eﬀective z-direction temperature.

This number in combination with Eq. (8) determines the beam waist at ≈ 20µm, in good

agreement with the theoretically calculated value of ≈ 23µm.

IV. MOVING CENTER OF MASS

In contrast to most other work with FORTs, we also studied geometries where the center

of mass moves as a result of a change in the potential. This was achieved by oﬀsetting the

foci of the CO2 beams from each other. In this conﬁguration, when one of the beams was

switched oﬀ, the atoms moved towards the new potential minimum located at the focus

of the remaining beam. For a harmonic trap the center of mass and internal dynamics of

the atomic cloud are decoupled from one another. However, for an anharmonic trap the

periodic motion of the center of mass of the atoms couples to the internal dynamics. Figure

Evolution time (ms)

FIG. 3: Evolution of the z cloud size inside the z beam for a stationary center of mass. Two beams

from a CO2 laser crossed each other at right angles with overlapped foci. The power in the x beam

was abruptly transferred to the z beam at t=0 to initiate the cloud’s oscillation.

4 schematically displays the trapping potential before and after power is transferred to the

z beam.

The observed z cloud size as a function of time for one period is presented in Fig. 5. As

occurred in the previous section, the cloud size in this direction never shrinks to its initial

value. Figure 5 also shows that the cloud undergoes a considerable increase in width by the

time it reaches the focus of the z-beam at t ≈ 10ms. It can be seen that the cloud size

increases by as much as 10 times its initial value. This implies a compression in momentum

spread by a similar factor and thus we expect a two order of magnitude reduction of the

eﬀective temperature in the z-direction. This is signiﬁcantly more than was possible in the

stationary center of mass experiments.

We also performed experiments in which the potential was switched oﬀ completely after

the atoms had evolved for various times inside the z-beam.There are several features of

the cloud’s evolution after release from the z-beam that are worthy of note. Firstly, it is

possible to tune the center of mass velocity in the z-direction with high precision. This

can be accomplished by changing the time span that the cloud evolves inside the z-beam

before it is switched oﬀ. Such a property could be useful for quantum reﬂection experiments

where precise control of the impact velocity is required [23]. A second aspect of the free

evolution is the observation of a collapse of the cloud in the z-direction during the ﬁrst

this case. In (b) the x and z cloud sizes are shown for the condition where the power from the x

few milliseconds after the atoms are released. To observe this collapse the cloud is ﬁrst

allowed to evolve inside the z-beam for nearly half a period of the center of mass motion.

The collapse can be explained by the velocity diﬀerence between the atoms on either side

of the cloud imprinted by the gradient of the trapping potential. This can be seen in Fig.

4(c). The exact time at which to switch the z-beam oﬀ to observe the maximum collapse

is determined experimentally. This time is 16 ms for the experiment shown in Fig. 5. The

resulting collapse or focusing can be used to transfer energy from the z to the x and y

directions if the cloud has high enough densities such that the free expansion starts when

the cloud is in the collisional regime. Under this condition, since at the release time the trap

has become elongated in the z direction, the atoms moving along the z direction experience

10

a larger number of collisions compared to the x and y directions and part of their z kinetic

energy transfers into x and y while expanding [24]. To explore this possibility, unlike in the

previous section, the evaporative cooling is carried out such that the cloud had a density
of ≈ 1014 atoms cm−3 (this corresponds to a mean free path of 9µm for our system). The

velocity distribution should remain constant with time after the expansion makes the mean

free path larger than the cloud size and the atoms reach the collisionless regime. Therefore

to determine the temperature the asymptotic expansion rate of the cloud data must be used

[25] after it has reached the collisionless regime .

For comparison we have conducted another series of experiments in which the power in

the CO2 laser was switched oﬀ without transferring total power to the z beam. Figure

6(a) shows the size of the atomic cloud as a function of time after release from a crossed

beam trap with 5 Watts of power. As can be seen, the expansion of the atoms is isotropic

(x and z data overlapp) and the corresponding temperature is about 3.7 (2) µK. In Fig.

6(b) the cloud size as a function of time is given for an experiment in which the atoms

were released from the crossed beam trap (oﬀ-set foci) and then allowed to evolve for 6

ms inside the z beam before all potentials were switched oﬀ and the free expansion began.

The asymptotic velocity for the elongated trap extracted from data given in Fig. 6(b) gives

Tz = 0.43(2) µK and Tx = 4.4(2) µK. The higher temperature in the x direction is caused by

the focusing of the cloud and the extra collisions atoms undergo in the z direction because

of the compressed cloud. The ratio is Tx/Tz = 10.2 which is quite close to the square of the

mean aspect ratio = 3.3 for the collisionless expansion. Figure 6(c) shows the ratio of the

x to z size of the cloud at diﬀerent times. Figure 7 shows the atomic cloud’s image for 4

diﬀerent times during the free expansion. Figure 7(a) shows the cloud at the crossed beam

without expansion and Fig. 7(b) is the same cloud after 4 ms free expansion. Fig. 7(c)

is taken 6 ms after turning the vertical beam oﬀ and Fig. 7(d) is the same cloud after 4

ms of free expansion. The accurate simulation of the individual atomic trajectories for the

free expansion is very time consuming because of the two-body cold collisions. In order to

overcome this problem we employ the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method which

was initially developed by Bird [26] to simulate molecular gas dynamics. This method has

been used for direct simulation of evaporative cooling [27] and free expansion of the cloud

of atoms [24]. Using this method the behavior of a cloud of atoms with 2 µK temperature

initially displaced 0.5zR from the potential minimum created by a gaussian beam with 25

µm beam waist was simulated. Figure 8 shows the simulated momentum distribution in

the z (narrow distribution) and x (broad distribution) directions after 5 ms free expansion.
The initial density was taken 1.8 × 1014 atom cm−3. As one can see the axial distribution

deviates little from a perfect gaussian. This has been reported previously for an expanding

cloud [24].

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have studied the eﬀect of geometrical changes of the trap on the atomic

cloud evolution. We experimented with two conﬁgurations of crossed laser beams. In the

ﬁrst set of experiments, the foci of two orthogonal beams were positioned to conincide. The

foci of the beams were subsequently oﬀset for the second set of experiments. In each case, the

behavior of the cloud upon abruptly switching oﬀ the x beam was studied. In the overlapped

foci experiment we observed high atomic density domains, due to the strong anharmonic

trapping potential. To reach the collisionless regime the trap density was reduced by lowering

the power in the beams. We observed oscillations in the axial z direction with an amplitude

up to a factor of 6 times the original cloud size. This implies that the momentum had been

times the initial cloud size were achieved. In this later case we observed the atomic cloud

to collapse in the z direction when released from certain positions in the trap. An energy

transfer from the z to the x direction was observed for this release condition for clouds with

Considering the fact that the cloud’s center of mass gains a z velocity this system could

be a useful tool in the study of quantum reﬂection of cold atoms from material surfaces

[28, 29, 30]. Another possible avenue for further investigations would be subjecting a Bose-

Einstein condensate to these potentials.

In a recent paper, we have used the dark-spot Zeeman tuned
slowing technique [Phys. Rev. A 62, 013404-1, (2000)] to
measure the capture velocity as a function of laser intensity
for a sodium magneto optical trap. Due to technical limita-
tion we explored only the low light intensity regime, from 0 to
27 mW/cm
. Now we complement that work measuring the
capture velocity in a broader range of light intensities (from
0 to 400 mW/cm
). New features, observed in this range, are
important to understant the escape velocity behavior, which
has been intensively used in the interpretation of cold colli-
sions.
In particular, we show in this brief report that the
capture velocity has a maximum as function of the trap laser
intensity, which would imply a minimum in the trap loss rates.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the prediction and the interpretation of trap loss
rates, an important parameter used is the escape velocity
(υe). Which is deﬁned as the minimum velocity an atom
has to achieve in order to overcome the radiative forces to
escape from the trap. This velocity is normally obtained
through numerical calculations where a single atom is
considered within the trap light forces. Such simulations
has been satisfactory in many cases, but real measure-
ments are important to reveal facts not included in the
simulations. The direct measurements of υe would be
ideal, but so far nobody yet has devised a direct scheme
to perform such experiments. So what has been actually
measured is the so called capture velocity (υc), deﬁned
as the maximum velocity of an atom traversing the trap
volume that can still be captured into the trap. The
value of υc is related to the value of υe, and υc can be
considered as an upper bound limit for υe.

In a recent publication [1] we have used a magneto op-
tical trap loaded from a dark-spot Zeeman tuned slower
[2] to measure the capture velocity in a range of trapping
light intensities from 0 to 27 mW/cm2. This range of
intensity covers only one part of the interest when deal-
ing with measurements of trap loss. Recently collision
experiments [3] have covered a much broader range of
intensities and the prediction for trap loss in this range
demands the knowledge of υe. High intensity is however
a diﬃcult regime to simulate because eﬀects such as ﬂuc-
tuations, polarization imperfection, the multilevel nature
of atoms, etc. are hard to be included in the calculation.
Measurements of υc in this range, may give us a good idea
about υe for the interpretation of collision experiments.

In what follows, we provide a brief description of our
experimental technique followed by our most recent mea-
surement of υc and a plausible explanation for the ob-
served behavior. This report should be considered as a
complement to our previous work [1].

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

To load our sodium MOT we use a cold atomic beam
from a Zeeman slower where a dark spot is placed in the
center of the slowing laser beam producing a shadow on
the position of the trap. This results in a large capture
of atoms in the MOT, due to the the minimum disturb-
ing eﬀect of the slowing laser on the atoms in the MOT
region. This technique has been fully described in ref.
[2]. Scanning the slowing laser, diﬀerent velocity classes
appear in the outgoing beam of atoms. The distribution
is narrow and the dependence on the slowing laser fre-
quency and its width has been studied before for a wide
range of laser frequencies [1]. The peak velocity depends
on the slowing laser frequency and basically obeys the
relation kυout = - ∆ [3], where ∆ is the slowing laser de-
tuning and k is the wave vector. This outgoing velocity
peak has also been investigated as a function of detuning
of the slowing laser [1].

The output velocity distribution from the slowing
process is close to a Gaussian distribution g(υ) =
Ae−(υ+∆/k)
, where A is a normalizing constant and
σ = ∆υ/2 is obtained from the previous investigations
[1] of the atomic distribution coming out from the slowing
process.

The procedure to measure the capture velocity is as
follows: the slowing laser is scanned ( ∼5MHz/s) as the
number of
trapped atoms is recorded. If the laser fre-
quency is far to the red, the atoms cross the trap volume
too quickly and will not be captured. When the fre-
quency is such that small velocities are present, atoms
start to accumulate in the trap until the whole distribu-
tion is captured. The number of captured atoms for each
laser detuning is well represented by the integral [1]

V. FIGURE CAPTIONS

FIG. 1. Theoretical curves showing the number of trapped
atoms as a function of the slowing laser frequency. As the
capture velocity is increased, the curves shift to higher values
of negative detuning.

FIG. 2. Measured capture velocity as a function of trap-
ping laser intensity for a detuning ∆ ∼ -10 M hz, half waist of
the Gaussian beam of 4.5mm and dB
dz = 20 Gauss/cm. The
dotted line used to connect the experimental points is just for
eye guidance.

This integral can be expressed as a combination of er-
ror functions, which provides an analytical expression for
Nc(∆). This function is however very dependent on υc.
In ﬁg. 1 we show Nc(∆) normalized for several consid-
ered capture velocities. As the capture velocity increases,
the curves for Nc(∆) are shifted towards higher values of
negative detunings. To determine υc, we have ﬁtted the
rising part of the measured spectrum with the best value
of υc. The process is repeated for several trap laser in-
tensities and υc is obtained as a function of trap laser in-
tensity. We used a trap laser detuning of −10 M Hz and
∼ 20 G/cm. In ﬁgure 2 we
a MOT ﬁeld gradient of dB
dz
show our measurement of the capture velocity for a broad
range of intensities. The dot line connecting the experi-
mental points is only for eye guidance. The uncertainties
comes from the statistical ﬂuctuations of the values ob-
tained in the best ﬁttings, due to the data scattering of
diﬀerent measurements.

The behavior of υc as a function of trapping laser in-
tensity for low intensities is as expected: seems to go to
zero for zero intensity and as the intensity increases it
reaches a smaller rate of increasing. This, in fact, agrees
well with our previous result [1]. The new feature here
is that υc reaches a maximum value for a given inten-
sity and start to decrease slowly after that point. In our
case, the maximum seems to be around 50 mW/cm2.
Since this is the total laser intensity when the six beams
are considered, the maximum in υc is taking place at
about 8 mW/cm2 per beam (not far from saturation
intensity for each beam). This results seems to con-
ﬁrm the discussions in ref. [4], that the capture process
might depend more on the damping part of the radia-
tion pressure than in the restoring force of the trap. In
this case, the maximum capture would correspond to the
situation of optimum balance between the beams. And
any further increase in intensity oversaturate the transi-
tions and the power broadening thereafter compromises
the atom distinction between the two counterpropagating
laser beams. In such a situation the damping coeﬃcient
starts to decrease and the same occurs to the capture
velocity. So far, after the peak capture velocity, we only
observe a decrease of υc with intensity.

III. CONCLUSION

The main consequence of this observation is that the
escape velocity (υe) should follow a similar pattern. And
such a behavior of the escape velocity with respect to
the trapping laser intensity would mean that the eﬀective
trap depth of a MOT has also a maximum, related with
that position of υe. This maximum in the trap depth
would imply the existence of a minimum for the trap
loss rate, which would be consistent with the recent al-
ternative interpretation for the behavior of the loss rate
coeﬃcient in MOTs as a function of laser intensity [4].
We should emphasize, however, that such a dependence

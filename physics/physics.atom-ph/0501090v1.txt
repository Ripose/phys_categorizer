We report an experimental study of an all-optical three-photon-absorption resonance (known as
a “N -resonance”) and discuss its potential application as an alternative to atomic clocks based on
coherent population trapping (CPT). We present measurements of the N -resonance contrast, width
and light-shift for the D1 line of 87Rb with varying buﬀer gases, and ﬁnd good agreement with an
analytical model of this novel resonance. The results suggest that N -resonances are promising for
atomic clock applications.

There is great current interest in developing compact,
robust atomic clocks with low power consumption and
fractional frequency stability better than 10−12 for a
wide variety of applications.
In recent years, signiﬁ-
cant progress toward this goal has been achieved us-
ing coherent population trapping (CPT) resonances in
atomic vapor [1, 2, 3, 4].
In this paper, we inves-
tigate an all-optical three-photon-absorption resonance
in Rb vapor [5], known as an “N -resonance”, which
combines advantages of CPT and traditional optically-
pumped double-resonance. We ﬁnd that the N -resonance
provides high contrast with modest systematic frequency
shifts, and thus may be suitable for small, stable atomic
clocks.

An N -resonance is a three-photon, two-ﬁeld resonance,
as shown in Fig. 1a. An optical probe ﬁeld, ΩP , resonant
with the transition between the higher-energy hyperﬁne
level of the ground electronic state (|bi) and an excited
state (|ai), optically pumps the atoms into the lower hy-
perﬁne level (|ci), leading to increased transmission of the
probe ﬁeld through the medium. A second, oﬀ-resonant
optical drive ﬁeld, ΩD, is detuned to lower frequencies
than the |bi → |ai transition. If the diﬀerence frequency
between ΩP and ΩD is equal to the hyperﬁne frequency,
a two-photon resonance is created, driving atoms coher-
ently from state |ci to |bi, followed by a one-photon ab-
sorption from ﬁeld ΩP which drives the atoms to the ex-
cited state |ai [6]. Thus, the absorption spectrum of the
ΩP ﬁeld will have two distinct features (Fig. 1a, bottom
row): a broad Doppler background due to linear absorp-
tion and a narrow resonance because of the three-photon
nonlinear process. Importantly for clock applications, the
N -resonance is all-optical; also, nearly 100% of the probe
ﬁeld is absorbed on resonance, which greatly reduces the
practical eﬀects of both shot noise, as well as phase noise
due to frequency/intensity noise conversion in the optical
ﬁelds [2, 7].

For comparison, we also plot in Fig. 1 typical level dia-
grams and schematic spectra of the probe light transmis-

sion for CPT and traditional optically-pumped double-
resonance schemes. CPT is a two-photon transmission
resonance (Fig. 1b) in which a coherence between two
hyperﬁne levels is created by two resonant ﬁelds (ΩP
and ΩD) whose frequency diﬀerence is equal to the hy-
perﬁne frequency. The absorption for both optical ﬁelds
decreases due to destructive interference of the absorp-
tion amplitudes, and a narrow transmission peak is ob-
served. Several groups [2, 3] have achieved fractional hy-
perﬁne frequency stabilities below 10−12 with CPT-based
clocks, which are also promising for miniaturization. In
the traditional optically-pumped double-resonance clock
(Fig. 1c), one optical ﬁeld (from a lamp or laser diode) is
resonant with one of the allowed transitions (|bi → |ai),

and thus optically pumps atoms to the other hyper-
ﬁne sublevel (|ci). A microwave ﬁeld resonant with the
ground-state hyperﬁne transition is applied, thereby re-
distributing the populations between the hyperﬁne levels
and leading to a narrow dip in the transmission spectrum
of the optical ﬁeld. The width of this absorption feature
is determined by the intensities of both the optical and
microwave ﬁelds as well as the atoms’ hyperﬁne decoher-
ence rate. With careful optimization of operational pa-
rameters, short-term fractional stabilities of 10−11 may
be achieved [8].

In practice, the frequency stability of an atomic clock
limited by photon shot noise is given by the Allan devi-
ation, σ(τ ), as [4]:

where ν0 is the atomic reference frequency, ∆ν is the full
width of the resonance, e is the electron charge, η is the
photodetector sensitivity (measured optical energy per
photoelectron) and τ is the integration time. The reso-
nance contrast C ≡ A/Ibg, where A is the relative inten-
sity of the clock resonance and Ibg is the intensity of the
background transmitted light (adopting notation similar
to reference [4]). These contrast parameters are shown
graphically in Fig. 1 for the N -resonance, CPT reso-
nance, and optically-pumped double-resonance schemes.

Figure 2a shows a schematic of our N -resonance exper-
imental set-up. We derived the probe and drive optical
ﬁelds (ΩP and ΩD) by phase modulating the output of an
external cavity diode laser (≈ 12 mW total power) tuned
in the vicinity of the D1 line of Rb (52S1/2 → 52P1/2,
λ ≃ 795 nm). An electro-optic modulator (EOM) pro-
duced the phase modulation of the optical ﬁeld at a fre-
quency near the ground electronic state hyperﬁne fre-
quency of 87Rb (ν0 ≃ 6.835 GHz). Approximately 2%
of the incident laser power was transferred to each ﬁrst-
order sideband, with the remainder residing in the car-
rier. The laser beam was then circularly polarized using
a quarter wave plate and weakly focused to a diameter
of 0.8 mm before entering the Rb vapor cell.

FIG. 3: Measured N -resonance linewidth as a function of
total incident laser power for 87Rb vapor cells ﬁlled with 40
Torr of Ne buﬀer gas (△) and a mixture of 10 Torr Ne and
15 Torr Ar ((cid:7)). The probe ﬁeld is tuned ≈ 300 MHz below the
F = 2 → F ′ = 2 transition of 87Rb. Solid lines are calculated
linewidths using an analytical N -resonance model.

We employed Pyrex cylindrical cells containing isotopi-
cally enriched 87Rb and either 40 Torr Ne buﬀer gas or a
10 Torr Ne + 15 Torr Ar mixture. During experiments,
the vapor cell under study was heated to 55 ◦C using a
blown-air oven. The cell was isolated from external mag-
netic ﬁelds with three layers of high permeability shield-
ing. A small (≈ 10 mG) longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld was
applied to lift the degeneracy of the Zeeman sublevels
and separate the desired F = 1, mF = 0 to F = 2,
mF = 0 clock transition (no ﬁrst-order magnetic ﬁeld
dependence) from the mF = ±1 transitions (ﬁrst-order
Zeeman splitting).

To produce the N -resonance we tuned the high fre-
quency optical sideband (serving as the probe ﬁeld ΩP )
near resonance with the 5S1/2 F = 2 → 5P1/2 F ′ = 1, 2
transitions. The strong laser carrier ﬁeld at a frequency
6.835 GHz below this transition was used as the drive
ﬁeld ΩD (see Fig. 1a). Note that we operate in the
regime of relatively low laser power and atomic density,
which is diﬀerent from [5]. In the present case all four-
wave mixing processes are insigniﬁcant, and the far-oﬀ-
resonance lower frequency sideband had negligible eﬀect
on the atoms. The strong drive ﬁeld and the lower side-
band were ﬁltered from the light transmitted through
the cell using a quartz, narrow-band Fabry-Perot etalon
(FSR = 20 GHz, ﬁnesse = 30), tuned to the frequency
of the probe ﬁeld and placed before the photodetector.
Such selective detection reduces the light background
(Ibg) by eliminating nonreasonant leakage from the drive
ﬁeld; and also increases the absorption amplitude (A)
by eliminating the stimulated Raman drive ﬁeld created
at two-photon resonance [5]. Our analytical modelling
of the N -resonance – based on the method developed in
[9, 10] for CPT resonances – indicates that the absorp-
tion amplitude A increases by ≈ 1.7 when only the probe
ﬁeld transmission is detected. (Details of this analytical
model will be described in a future publication).

FIG. 4: Measured dependence of N -resonance contrast on

Ne-Ar mixture ((cid:7)). These N -resonance frequencies include a
buﬀer gas pressure shift of the 87Rb ground state hyperﬁne

the 25 Torr Ne-Ar mixture [16, 17]. Solid lines are calculations
from an analytical model.

diﬀerent buﬀer gases. At lower laser power, linewidths
< 1 kHz are observed: e.g., ∆ν ≈ 300 Hz at 50 µW total
laser power for the 40 Torr Ne cell. At larger laser powers
the linewidth increases approximately linearly with laser
power. As also shown in Fig. 3, our calculations are in
good agreement with the measured variation of linewidth
with laser power.

Fig. 4 shows measurements of the N -resonance con-
trast C = A/Ibg for two buﬀer gas cells. For both cells
the contrast increases rapidly with laser power, and then
saturates at C > 15% for total incident laser power ∼
1 mW. This saturated N -resonance contrast exceeds the
contrast that has been achieved with CPT resonances,
C < 4% [4]. However, the relatively large laser power
required to saturate the N -resonance contrast leads to
an increased linewidth (see Fig. 3). To account for these
competing eﬀects of laser power, we follow Vanier et al.
[4] and employ a resonance quality factor q ≡ C/∆ν as
a ﬁgure of merit for N -resonance clocks. For example,
for 120 µW of laser power for the 40 Torr Ne cell, we
ﬁnd ∆ν ≈ 1 kHz and C ≈ 0.1 for the 87Rb N -resonance
(see Figs. 3 and 4), implying q ≈ 10−4 and an estimated
frequency stability from Eq. (1) of σ(τ ) ∼ 10−14τ 1/2.

Importantly, Fig. 4 also shows that the N -resonance
contrast reaches its maximum at lower laser powers for
the higher-pressure 40 Torr Ne vapor cell than for the
cell with the 25 Torr Ne-Ar mixture. We attribute this
diﬀerence to slower Rb diﬀusion out of the laser ﬁelds
at higher buﬀer gas pressure, and hence reduced ground-
state coherence loss and more eﬃcient optical pumping.
In addition, we did not observe a deterioration of the
N -resonance contrast with increased buﬀer gas pressure,
as has been observed for CPT resonances [4]. This ob-
servation suggests that the N -resonance may be a good
candidate for miniature atomic clocks, where high buﬀer
gas pressure is required to prevent rapid atomic deco-
herence due to collisions with the walls of a small vapor

cell.

We also characterized the light-shift of the 87Rb N -
resonance. A light-shift is a relative AC Stark shift of
atomic levels that depends on both the optical ﬁeld fre-
quency and intensity [11]. Light-shifts are a primary sys-
tematic eﬀect limiting the frequency stability of optically-
pumped atomic clocks and should be present for N -
resonances at some level. To leading order in a simple
two-level picture, the light-shift, ∆ls, of the clock fre-
quency is given by

∆ls = −

∆

ab + 4∆2 |ΩP |2,
γ2

(2)

where ∆ is the detuning of the probe ﬁeld from the atomic
transition. For small ∆, the light-shift is linear in the
laser frequency (∆) and intensity (∝ |ΩP |2). Fluctua-
tions in these parameters are thus directly transferred
to the clock frequency. For example, light-shifts limit
the fractional frequency stability of optically-pumped
double-resonance clocks at the level of 10−11 [12, 13, 14].
In CPT clocks, light-shifts may be eliminated, in prin-
ciple. In practice, however, the diode laser typically used
in a CPT clock is driven with strong current-modulation
to produce the two strong, resonant optical ﬁelds ΩP
and ΩD. This modulation scheme necessarily leads to:
(i) higher-order sidebands, which, even when optimally
adjusted, can induce non-trivial second-order light-shifts
[15]; and (ii) unwanted amplitude modulation of the op-
tical ﬁelds, resulting in an imbalance between sideband
intensities as large as 10% [2]. These imperfections lead
to residual light-shifts of ∼ 0.2 Hz/(µW/cm2) (for shifts
induced by changes in the carrier ﬁeld intensity) and 1
Hz/MHz (for shifts induced by changes in the carrier ﬁeld
frequency) [2, 3, 4]. In practice, the short- and medium-
term frequency stability of CPT clocks is limited by such
light-shifts [3, 4].

FIG. 6: Measured dependence of the N -resonance frequency
on the total incident laser power, with the probe ﬁeld tuned
≈ 300 MHz below the F = 2 → F ′
= 2 transition of 87Rb.
Upper trace: 40 Torr Ne (△). Lower trace: 25 Torr Ne-Ar
mixture ((cid:7)). As in Fig. 5, the N -resonance frequencies include
the buﬀer gas pressure shift. Solid lines are calculations from
an analytical model.

As shown in Fig. 5, we measured two extrema in the
N -resonance light-shift as a function of probe ﬁeld fre-
quency. (We determined the N -resonance frequency from
the diﬀerence frequency between the probe and drive
ﬁelds at which the transmitted probe light intensity was
minimized.) At these extrema the light-shift depends
quadratically on the probe ﬁeld detuning. Addition-
ally, the second-order light-shift near the extrema is re-
duced at higher buﬀer gas pressure, from approximately
4.0 mHz/MHz2 for the 25 Torr Ne-Ar mixture to 2.5
mHz/MHz2 for the 40 Torr Ne cell, suggesting again that
N -resonances may be well suited to small vapor cells em-
ploying high buﬀer gas pressure. Fig. 6 shows the mea-

4

sured dependence of the N -resonance light-shift on total
laser power. We ﬁnd a linear dependence, with a sim-
ilar variation of 25 mHz/(µW/cm2) for diﬀerent buﬀer
gases. These N -resonance light-shifts are about an order
of magnitude smaller than for existing CPT clocks.

Finally, we note that N -resonances on the D2 line of
alkali vapor may also be promising for clock applications.
Our analytical model suggests higher N -resonance con-
trast on the D2 transition due to strong collisional mix-
ing of the Zeeman levels in the electronic excited state,
which suppresses optical pumping to the end Zeeman lev-
els in the ground electronic state. (Note, CPT contrast
is smaller for the D2 line than for the D1 line due to
pressure broadening of the excited state hyperﬁne levels
[18].) Currently, diode lasers on the D2 line of Rb and
Cs are more easily obtained.

In summary, we measured the properties of an N -
resonance on the D1 line in Rb vapor cells with vary-
ing buﬀer gases. We found that this N -resonance has
greater contrast than the corresponding CPT resonance
and order-of-magnitude smaller light-shifts. These re-
sults suggest that an all-optical atomic clock locked to an
N -resonance may provide improved short and medium
In
term frequency stability compared to CPT clocks.
addition, we found that the N -resonance contrast does
not degrade, nor the light-shifts worsen, with increased
buﬀer gas pressure. Hence, N -resonances may be good
candidates for miniature atomic clocks.

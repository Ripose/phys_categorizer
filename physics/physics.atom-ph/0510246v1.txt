Abstract

The generation of high-order harmonics in diatomic molecules is investigated within the frame-

work of the strong-ﬁeld approximation. We show that the conventional saddle-point approximation

is not suitable for large internuclear distances. An adapted saddle-point method that takes into ac-

count the molecular structure is presented. We analyze the predictions for the harmonic-generation

spectra in both the velocity and the length gauge. At large internuclear separations, we compare

the resulting cutoﬀs with the predictions of the simple-man’s model. Good agreement is obtained

only by using the adapted saddle-point method combined with the velocity gauge.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of strong laser pulses with atoms or molecules leads to a variety of in-

teresting phenomena. Among them, the generation of high-order harmonics [1, 2, 3, 4] is

of particular interest, as it serves as a source of high-frequency coherent radiation, along

with the generation of attosecond pulses. The possibility of their control and optimization

promises fascinating applications [5, 6].

For atoms, harmonic generation (HG) has been intensively studied and is well understood

in terms of the three-step semiclassical mechanism [8, 9], also known as the simple-man’s

model. In the framework of the strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA), the simple-man’s model

has its quantum-mechanical counterpart in the model proposed by Lewenstein et al. [10].

The Lewenstein model for HG in atoms provides a good qualitative and quantitative agree-

ment with ab initio calculations, which become prohibitive at high laser intensities. The

advantage of the model is at least two-fold: First, in contrast to the integration of the

time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE), it provides a physical understanding of the

underlying mechanisms and a certain degree of analytical description. Second, the HG

spectrum can be obtained with much less computational eﬀort than from the TDSE. This is

essential for calculating macroscopic eﬀects during the propagation of the harmonic radiation

in the medium.

The study of HG in molecules is at its early stages. Since molecules have additional

degrees of freedom and more complicated symmetries, the physical phenomena are much

richer. Experiments have shown that the ionization of molecules is greatly inﬂuenced by

the molecular orientation with respect to the laser polarization direction [11]. With the

HG process depending greatly upon ionization, one has a similar eﬀect for the emission of

the harmonic radiation [5, 7, 12]. Moreover, some molecules can withstand laser intensities

much higher than in the atomic case [13, 15]. As a consequence, harmonic radiation can

be extended to higher photon energies [14]. Furthermore, in the semiclassical picture the

returning wave packet encounters the molecular core with several atomic sites whose contri-

butions interfere. Thus, the multicenter nature of molecules can lead to interference eﬀects

in HG [16, 17]. Similarly, diﬀraction is predicted to occur in the above-threshold ionization

(ATI) [18, 19] spectra. By varying the orientation of the molecule, a certain harmonic range

can be maximized or minimized [16, 17, 20, 21, 22].

2

A proposed mechanism to generate harmonics of very high frequency involves probing

a molecule stretched well beyond its equilibrium distance [24]. Note that pump–probe

experiments have already been carried out, where such large internuclear distances have

been created [23]. The large internuclear separation allows the electron to be detached

from one site and accelerated by the laser ﬁeld towards another site, where is captured

and emits an energetic photon. According to the simple-man’s model, the maximal kinetic

energy before recombination can be as big as 8Up in such a process [24, 25], where Up is the

ponderomotive energy of the electron in the external ﬁeld.

The theoretical description of HG in molecules is largely based up to now on the nu-

merical integration of the Schr¨odinger equation in one spatial dimension [26, 27, 28], two

dimensions [17, 29] or in three dimensions [20, 21, 22, 30]. Other approaches include two-

level models [30, 31]. The numerical calculations for molecules require more care than for

atoms since one needs to study the dependence on orientation and bond length. Including

the vibrational motion of the nuclei poses yet another diﬃculty. Hence, developing theoret-

ical models can be a way to alleviate these diﬃculties and provide deeper understanding of

the physical mechanisms. The ﬁrst choice would be the extension of the Lewenstein model

to the molecular case. As it turns out, due to the multicenter aspect of molecules, this

is not a straightforward task. For example, the ground state required in the Lewenstein

model is not known analytically for molecules. One has to use approximations, such as the

linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation. It was shown that the ground

state must have the correct symmetry in order for the model to be able to describe at least

at a qualitative level the dependence of ionization on the molecular orientation. This can

be seen from the successful molecular-Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (MO-ADK) theory [32] for

molecular ionization. Using the correct ground-state symmetry, the Lewenstein model for

molecules seems to give good qualitative predictions [33] for the alignment dependence of

the HG yields. For a more detailed discussion on the importance of the orbital symmetry,

see Ref. [34].

The choice of gauge in analytical approximations is known to be diﬃcult. While results

from the TDSE are invariant under gauge transformations, this is not so for the SFA (for a

discussion in the atomic case, see Ref. [35]). The SFA was used in [25] for a three-dimensional

zero-range potential with two centers. Considering the harmonic emission from an atom

which is displaced from the origin of the coordinate system by an arbitrary distance, the

3

authors show that spurious eﬀects, like the presence of even harmonics in the spectrum arise

in both the velocity and the length gauge. While in the velocity gauge the odd harmonics

are invariant under the spatial translation, in the length gauge this invariance holds for

neither the even nor the odd harmonics. Moreover, for the calculation of the harmonic

spectra there is a choice between dipole, momentum and acceleration formulations.

In

Ref. [22], a simpliﬁed version of the Lewenstein model is adapted to the molecular case.

The authors show that the two-center interference minima can be well reproduced provided

that the acceleration formulation is used to calculate the HG spectrum (i.e., the dipole

acceleration is calculated by means of the Ehrenfest’s theorem, as the expectation value of

the force acting on the active electron). The dipole formulation predicts interference minima

in severe disagreement with the TDSE results.

In the present paper, we present a detailed analysis of the Lewenstein model for molecules,

investigating both the length and the velocity gauge. We show that the conventional saddle-

point approximation used for the Volkov evolution operator leads to unphysical results for

large internuclear distances. We propose a modiﬁed version of the saddle-point approxima-

tion, taking into account the structure of the molecule. As a consequence, one obtains the

HG amplitude as a sum over diﬀerent electron trajectories, with ionization and recombina-

tion taking place at diﬀerent molecular sites (the “exchange term” from Ref. [25]) or identical

ones (“the return” term from Ref. [25]). We show that only in the velocity gauge, the new

saddle-point formulation gives agreement with the cutoﬀs predicted by the simple-man’s

model [24].

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we revisit the conventional Lewenstein

model and its extension to molecules, with the molecular ground state approximated as a

linear combination of atomic orbitals. Both the length gauge and the velocity gauge are

studied comparatively throughout this work. The resulting expressions are then analyzed

within the conventional saddle-point approximation in Sec. III, and an adapted version of the

saddle-point approximation is proposed. This new version takes into account the molecular

structure, which now appears explicitly in the emerging electronic trajectories derived from

the saddle-point equations. Sec. IV is devoted to the numerical evaluation of the diﬀerent

analytical expressions of the HG amplitude. The harmonic cutoﬀs for diﬀerent internu-

clear distances are compared to the cutoﬀs predicted by the simple-man’s model applied

to molecules [24].

It is shown, both analytically and numerically, that only the velocity

4

gauge together with the adapted saddle-point approximation yields cutoﬀs in agreement

with the simple-man’s model. Finally, Sec. V contains a short summary, our conclusions

and perspectives.

II. THEORETICAL APPROACH

A. The strong-ﬁeld approximation (length gauge)

To obtain the strong-ﬁeld approximation for the harmonic-generation process, we fol-

low closely the approach of the Lewenstein model of HG in atoms [10]. We start from the
dipole approximation and the length–gauge Hamiltonian for a H+

2 molecule with ﬁxed ori-

entation irradiated by a laser ﬁeld linearly polarized along the x axis (atomic units are used

throughout):

H =

+ V (r, R) + E(t)x,

(1)

∇2

−

2

where V is the Coulomb interaction with the two protons and R is the internuclear distance,

here taken as a parameter. Its orientation with respect to the laser polarization direction

may vary. The molecule is in the (x, y) plane and the laser propagates along the z axis.

We label the two nuclei as nucleus A at the position

R/2 and nucleus B at position R/2,

−

respectively.

Following Ref. [10], we assume that (a) no bound states other than the ground state

are populated, (b) the depletion of the ground state can be neglected, and (c) while in the

continuum, the active electron does not interact with the core. Although we focus on the

hydrogen molecular ion, for molecules such as the hydrogen molecule, one may additionally

assume that only a single electron can become active, i.e., if one of the electrons has been

excited into the continuum, the second electron will not couple to the ﬁeld and will always

remain in the lowest electronic state of the molecular ion. The expression for the electronic

dipole moment is the same as given in [10] for an atom:

where the integration is carried out over the duration of the laser pulse, Tp. Due to the

anisotropy of the molecular system, in contrast to atoms, the emitted radiation can be

polarized along other directions than the laser polarization axis. Here we consider only the

harmonic radiation polarized along the direction of the laser electric ﬁeld, ˆx.

use only the spatial part of the Volkov solution. The temporal phase of the Volkov solution

is included in the semiclassical action.

For the recombination step, we have

whereby an electron under the inﬂuence of the external ﬁeld only, described by a plane-

wave Volkov solution, recombines with the molecular core. Because we employ plane waves

to describe the electron motion in the continuum, some peculiarities in the predictions for

the harmonic spectra are expected. The plane-wave description is more accurate for fast

electrons returning to the ionic core after spending a longer time in the continuum. As

a consequence, the predictions are expected to be more accurate for high-order harmonics

than for low-order ones, where other eﬀects not included here, such as the inﬂuence of the

binding potential, come into play. A shortcoming of the current SFA formulation is that

the ionization and recombination amplitudes are not translationally invariant, due to the

fact that the Volkov wave function and the ground state are not orthogonal. For atoms, the

predictions of the SFA for harmonic generation are in good agreement with the ab initio

results, provided that the atom is considered in the origin of the coordinate system. For

molecules, the nuclei cannot be both in the origin of the coordinate system and the lack of

6

translation invariance causes more serious problems. We discuss these in the later sections

of this work.

In order to calculate the dipole moment, one needs to know the ground state of the system.

For the H-atom, this is known analytically, but for molecules one has to use approximations

to obtain an analytical form. Here we adopt the linear combination of atomic orbitals

(LCAO) approximation, i.e., the molecular ground state is taken to be:

−

−

ψ0(r, R) =

[ψh(r + R/2) + ψh(r

R/2)] ,

(6)

with ψh(r) being the hydrogen ground state. Furthermore, s(R) = exp(

R)(3 + 3R + R2)/3

is the overlap integral between the two atomic orbitals, needed to ensure normalization. By

using Eq. (6) in (4) and (5), the ionization amplitude reads

In comparison to the atomic case, the transition amplitudes (7) and (8) depend now on the

internuclear distance R and the molecular orientation. Thus, two-center interference eﬀects

[16] in the harmonic spectrum might arise.

Before proceeding to the next section, we brieﬂy compare the exact bound state to the

LCAO form that we use in the ionization and recombination amplitudes. The internuclear
distance chosen here is the equilibrium distance in H+
2 . Fig. 1 shows the comparison between
the gradient along the internuclear axis of the Fourier transform ˜ψ0(k) of the electronic

ground state, obtained by using the LCAO wave function and, correspondingly, by using

the ‘exact’ one. The dips in the ﬁgure appear at zeros of the two functions. The projection

of the gradient on the internuclear axis is useful when studying molecules aligned with the

laser ﬁeld. In this case the electron momentum is mainly directed along the molecular axis

and the recombination amplitude relates to the quantity showed in the ﬁgure. One can see

that the LCAO approximation works well.

B. The strong-ﬁeld approximation (velocity gauge)

To complete the analysis of the strong-ﬁeld approximation, we adopt as well the velocity

gauge. The Hamiltonian reads:

H =

The diﬀerences with respect to the length-gauge form occur in the matrix elements describing

the ionization and the recombination. This is due to the diﬀerent form of the Volkov wave

function and of the interaction Hamiltonian. For the ionization amplitude dion(k, R, t) =

(11)

The recombination amplitude has the same functional form as in Eq. (8), but it appears

in Eq. (10) with an argument diﬀerent from Eq. (2). The diﬀerence is that in the velocity

gauge, the drift momentum p appears in the matrix elements, instead of the kinematical

momentum p + A(t).

Although the length and the velocity gauge should be equivalent, signiﬁcant diﬀerences

appear in the predicted harmonic-generation spectra. Employing the saddle-point approx-

imation, a detailed analysis of the two gauges is given in the following. We show that the

presence of two centers makes the usual saddle-point approximation used to sum over the

electron momenta in Eq. (10) questionable. This is due to the oscillatory terms present in

the Fourier transform of the ground state [e.g., the factor cos(k

R/2) in Eq. (11)]. For large

·

internuclear distances, it becomes necessary to take these terms into account when applying

the saddle-point method.

III. THE SADDLE-POINT APPROXIMATION AND THE CORRESPONDING

ELECTRONIC TRAJECTORIES

A. Length gauge

1. The case of small internuclear distance

The dipole expression in (2) contains an integral over all possible intermediate electron
momenta p. The presence of the semiclassical action S(p, t, t′) makes the integrand highly

oscillatory and therefore the saddle-point approximation can be used. Assuming that the

rest of the integrand is a smooth function of momentum, the saddle-point momentum is ob-
tained from the condition that the action is stationary, i.e., ∇pS(p, t, t′)
ps(t′, t) =

p=ps = 0, implying

with ǫ a small cutoﬀ parameter. The term (t

electron wave packet during the motion in the continuum.

−

For a complete description in terms of complex electron trajectories [36, 37, 38, 39] that

contribute to the HG spectrum, one needs to apply the saddle-point approximation for
both the integration over the time t′ in (12) and over t in (3). This gives two more saddle
equations, one for the tunnelling time t′

s and one for the harmonic emission time ts. As
all the saddle equations are obtained from the semiclassical action, which is the same as in

the atomic case, the electron trajectories do not reﬂect the structure of the molecule. The

only diﬀerences lie in the expressions for the recombination and ionization amplitudes, but

the saddle momentum which governs the trajectories in the simple-man’s model [8] does not

‘feel’ the molecular structure. Although they are the same as in [10], we repeat them here

for completeness:

−

(13)

They simply state that the electron is born in the continuum with approximately zero kinetic

energy and that the energy is conserved when the electron recombines into the ground state,

followed by emission of a photon with energy Ω. Equations (13) can be used to determine

the cutoﬀ in the harmonic spectrum, which is predicted to occur for a monochromatic laser

ﬁeld close to Ω = 3.17Up + Ip, the same as in the atomic simple-man’s model.

Unlike the H-atom case, for molecules both the ionization (7) and the recombination (8)

amplitude contain an oscillatory factor, whose argument is proportional to the internuclear

distance R. This means that for increasing R, the integrand becomes more and more os-
cillatory as a function of t and t′, i.e., the above saddle-point equations are not valid and

the cutoﬀ of the harmonic spectrum increases. We ﬁnd this eﬀect present in the numeri-

cal calculations. Moreover, the extra oscillatory factor makes the saddle-point method for

momentum questionable. Hence, it becomes necessary to include the extra oscillations by

adding them to the semiclassical action, when the saddle-point approximation is applied.

We discuss this approach and its consequences in the following.

10

2. The case of large internuclear distance

To account for the extra oscillatory factors, we include them in the oscillatory function

used to derive the saddle momentum. In the simpler method of the previous section, only the

oscillations due to the semiclassical action were taken into account. The present procedure

reveals a more accurate picture of the harmonic generation process. It changes the deﬁnition

of the complex electron trajectories, which now depend on the structure of the molecule. We

proceed by re-writing the ionization and recombination amplitudes in the following form:

dion(k, R, t) = i+ exp(ik

drec,x(k, R) = r+ exp(ik

R/2) + i− exp(

(14)

From the product d∗

rec,x[p + A(t), R]dion[p + A(t′), R, t′] of the two amplitudes (14) there
are four terms arising for diﬀerent combination of signs in the exponential. Each of these

terms gives rise to a diﬀerent oscillatory behavior of the integrand. Therefore, the saddle

equation for the electron momentum is diﬀerent for each of the four cases. We treat them

separately and emphasize the physical picture they convey.

1. The combination with the prefactor r∗

+i− leads to an oscillatory behavior through

R + [A(t) + A(t′)]

in Eq. (3), one obtains for the tunnelling time t′

The expression of the saddle momentum along with the condition for the tunnelling

time (15) deﬁne an electron trajectory such that, after the electron was ‘born’ in
the continuum at nucleus B at a time close to Re(t′

s), it oscillates in the ﬁeld and

recombines with the molecular core at nucleus A. We call the harmonics generated by

tunneling and recombination at diﬀerent molecular sites transfer harmonics.

Equations (15) and (16) are conditions for the conservation of energy during ioniza-

tion and recombination, respectively. In these equations, the ionization potential is

unchanged (remember that the SFA considers the ground state not dressed by the

external ﬁeld). Only the continuum is shifted by the potential energy of the electron

in the external electric ﬁeld at the two sites, A and B. This way, there is an additional

unphysical energy diﬀerence between the Volkov state and the ground state of the

electron, which can be seen in Eqns. (15) and (16).

Similarly, the term with the prefactor r∗

−i+ describes a process where the electron is

‘born’ at the nucleus A and recombines at the nucleus B. The equations describing

this process are as given above, with R changing sign.

The saddle equations for the emission time, Eqns. (16) and (18), state that the relation

radiation depends on the continuum energy shifts E(t′

values of R, this gives rise to unphysically high harmonic cutoﬀs. One can make a rough

estimate of the cutoﬀ for large R, obtaining Ωc of the order

(E0R), where E0 is the electric

ﬁeld amplitude.

In conclusion, the harmonic cutoﬀ still increases monotonically with increasing internu-

clear distance. In the velocity gauge, the new formulation of the saddle-point approximation

for momenta eliminates this artifact.

B. Velocity gauge

Again, the ionization and recombination amplitudes contain oscillatory factors that give

rise to harmonic cutoﬀs that increase with increasing internuclear distance. The situation is

completely diﬀerent if we take the extra oscillatory factors into account when we apply the

saddle-point approximation.

2. The case of large internuclear distance

We proceed similarly to the length-gauge calculation, re-writing the ionization and re-

combination amplitudes in the form of Eqns. (14). From the product d∗

rec,x(k, R)dion(k, R, t)

13

of the two amplitudes there are four terms arising for diﬀerent combination of signs in the

exponential. Each of these terms gives rise to a diﬀerent oscillatory behavior of the inte-

grand. Therefore, the saddle equation for the momentum of the electron is diﬀerent for each

of the four cases. We treat them separately and analyze the corresponding physical picture

in terms of electronic trajectories.

recombines with the molecular core at nucleus A.

Similarly, the term with the prefactor r∗

−i+ describes a process where the electron

is ‘born’ at nucleus A and recombines at nucleus B. The equations describing this

process are as given above, with R changing sign. We note that unlike for the case

of the length gauge, the saddle equations that describe the complex trajectories agree

with the classical equations of motions of the simple-man’s model if one sets Ip = 0,

as is usually done when casting the complex trajectories in the language of the simple-

man’s model. The harmonic cutoﬀ in this case can be as much as 8Up + Ip for a

monochromatic ﬁeld [24, 25]. This will be addressed in more detail in the next section.

The term with the prefactor r∗

−i− corresponds to the same kind of trajectory, but

for the other nucleus. The saddle equations are identical to the ones that describe

the harmonic generation in the atomic case, and therefore have the usual cutoﬀ of

3.17Up + Ip for stationary laser ﬁelds.

In the velocity gauge, the new formulation of the saddle-point for momenta eliminates the

artifact that the harmonic cutoﬀ increases indeﬁnitely with increasing internuclear distance.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For the calculation of harmonic spectra, we choose a laser electric ﬁeld with two optical

cycles turn-on and turn-oﬀ and a plateau of three constant-amplitude optical cycles. Unless
stated otherwise, we consider a H+

2 molecular ion aligned with the ﬁeld, irradiated by a laser
1014 W/cm2. The energy of the elec-

with a wavelength of 800 nm and intensity equal to 2
tronic ground state is given by Ip(R) = V +

BO(R)

×

1/R, where V +

BO is the Born-Oppenheimer

−

potential for the electronic ground state (including the proton-proton interaction energy).

We focus our analysis on the variation of the cutoﬀ energy with the internuclear distance

R [24, 25]. In particular, we consider the cutoﬀ related to the process in which the electron

leaves the nucleus A and recombines at the nucleus B. As discussed in [25], for R = (2n +

1)πα0 (n = 0, 1, 2 . . .) the maximal kinetic energy at B can be as much as 8Up for a linearly

polarized monochromatic ﬁeld, where α0 is large on the atomic scale (for the present laser

parameters, α0 = 23.3 a.u.). For the maximal kinetic energy, the value of the internuclear

distance is such that an electron detached at zero electric ﬁeld at A is accelerated for half an

A. Length gauge results

To better understand the harmonic spectra as they emerge from the SFA, panel (a) of Fig.

3 shows the harmonic spectrum for the atomic case. Using the conventional saddle-point

method, the contribution of the recombination amplitude to the dipole moment simpliﬁes

where Rx is the projection of the internuclear distance on the polarization direction and kret

the behavior of the harmonic eﬃciency for harmonic orders bigger than the molecular binding

potential is oscillatory, while for smaller harmonics is exponential. Thus, the predictions

of the SFA in the energy region around the binding potential Ip are distorted. This energy

region is not described well by the SFA model, which does not fully include the eﬀect of the

Coulomb potential. Another remark in view of the above is that the two-center interference

eﬀect in HG is seen to stem mainly from the explicit form of the recombination amplitude.

Therefore, for a good description of the interference, one has to provide a realistic expression

for the recombination amplitude.

Fig. 3 shows harmonic spectra for diﬀerent internuclear distances. The ﬁrst thing to

notice is that both the harmonic cutoﬀ and the harmonic intensity increase with increasing

internuclear separation. This is due to the presence of the oscillatory factors depending on R

in the ionization and recombination amplitudes (see the comments at the end of Sec. III A 1).

The arrows in Fig. 3 show the cutoﬀ of the transfer harmonics as predicted by the simple-

man’s model (Fig. 2). Since the present SFA formulation does not include rescattering of

the electron from the molecular sites, we expect that the maximal harmonic order comes

from the transfer mechanism. As seen from the ﬁgure, for large values of R, there is a

signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the SFA predictions in in the length gauge and the simple-

man’s predictions. The following ﬁgures will again display the cutoﬀs from the simple-man’s

model for comparison.

The contribution from the ionization amplitude in the case when R is small depends on

terms such as sinh(Rx

2Ip/2) and cosh(Rx

2Ip/2), as it can be shown by expanding the

q
relevant quantities in Taylor series around the ionization times from the simple-man’s model.

q

This explains the increase of the harmonic intensity with increasing internuclear distance.

Thus, the unphysical increase in the harmonic eﬃciency is exponential in R.

So far, we have discussed the results within the conventional saddle-point method for

summation over the electron momenta. We turn now to the second saddle-point formulation

for electron momenta (presented in Sec. III A 2). Fig. 4 plots the predicted harmonic spectra.

To assess the importance of the direct harmonics, we plot them in panel (d) of Fig. 4. Their

cutoﬀ is smaller in this case than the cutoﬀ of the transfer harmonics. The artifacts regarding

the cutoﬀ and the harmonic eﬃciency are present.

B. Velocity gauge results

For the velocity gauge and using the conventional saddle-point method, the harmonic

spectra (Fig. 5) are similarly unphysical as those obtained in the length gauge. The shape

of the spectra is slightly changed together with the values of the cutoﬀs. The increase of the

cutoﬀ with increasing internuclear distance R is present. A striking diﬀerence with respect to

the length gauge, however, arises when one uses the second formulation of the saddle-point

method, see Fig. (6). In this case, the unphysical increase of the cutoﬀ with R is eliminated.

C. Comparison of the harmonic generation cutoﬀs with the predictions of the

simple-man’s model for large internuclear distances

We compare the cutoﬀs for the transfer harmonics as predicted by the SFA using the

adapted saddle-point method in both the length and velocity gauge with the predictions

of the simple-man’s model. Fig. 7 shows the numerical results for very large internuclear

separations. The arrows point to the semiclassical cutoﬀs from the simple-man’s model.

One can see that the length gauge overestimates by far the cutoﬀs as well as the harmonic

intensity. In contrast, the velocity gauge together with the adapted saddle-point formulation

succeeds in reproducing the simple-man’s cutoﬀs, as well as keeping a bounded magnitude

for the harmonic intensities.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

The SFA is a useful tool for studying processes in intense laser ﬁelds. It is of big advantage

for molecules, where a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation can be more prohibitive than

for an atom. There are still open questions about how to adapt the SFA for molecules such

that its level of prediction would become as good as for the atomic case.

Here, we have analyzed the strong-ﬁeld approximation for the calculation of the harmonic-

generation spectra in ultrashort laser pulses. Using the conventional saddle-point method

to approximate the sum over the electron momenta in the Volkov propagator, we have

shown that both the length gauge and the velocity gauge predict harmonic intensities and

cutoﬀs that increase unphysically with increasing internuclear separation. Also, the emerging

trajectories for the electronic complex orbits [36, 37, 38, 39] do not reﬂect the structure of

the molecule and are the same as for the atomic case. In order to account for the presence

of the two centers, we have introduced an adapted saddle-point method that takes into

account the molecular structure. As a consequence, we obtain explicitly diﬀerent types of

electronic trajectories and corresponding harmonics, namely direct harmonics (generated by

tunneling and recombination of the active electron at the same site) and transfer harmonics

(generated by tunneling followed by recombination at a diﬀerent site). The interesting

observation is that the length gauge still predicts in the adapted saddle-point formulation

unbounded cutoﬀs and harmonic intensities as the internuclear separation is increased. Thus,

the length-gauge SFA, in its present form, appears to be inappropriate for the description

of high-harmonic generation at large internuclear distances. In contrast, the velocity gauge

predicts bounded harmonic intensities and cutoﬀs of the transfer harmonics. Only in the

velocity gauge the cutoﬀs agree with the values obtained from the simple-man’s model.

Not addressed in this work is the question about the role played by the excited molecular

include them in the SFA. Furthermore, we have not investigated the question which gauge

is suitable for small internuclear separations, but there are indications that the length gauge

will be preferable in this case [40]. We believe that this work is a step towards building an

accurate SFA for harmonic generation in molecules.

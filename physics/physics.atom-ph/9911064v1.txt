Abstract. – We identify a fundamental structure in the spectrum of microwave driven alkali
Rydberg states, which highlights the remnants of the Coulomb symmetry in the presence of a
non-hydrogenic core. Core-induced corrections with respect to the hydrogen spectrum can be
accounted for by a perturbative approach.

Introduction. – The excitation and subsequent ionization of Rydberg states of atomic
hydrogen by microwave ﬁelds is one of the most prominent examples of the manifestation
of classically nonlinear dynamics in a realistic physical system [1]. Given a driving ﬁeld
frequency comparable to the classical Kepler frequency of the unperturbed Rydberg electron,
the electron’s classical trajectory goes chaotic for suﬃciently large driving ﬁeld amplitudes,
ﬁnally leading to its ionization on a ﬁnite time scale [2]. Correspondingly, large ionization
rates are observed in experiments on real (i.e., quantum) Rydberg states of atomic hydrogen,
in the appropriate parameter range [1, 3].

As a matter of fact, already before the onset of classically chaotic motion, i.e. at not
too large driving ﬁeld amplitudes, individual quantum eigenstates of the atom in the ﬁeld
exhibit energies and ionization rates which are determined only by the orbital parameters
of the classical trajectory they are associated with [4]. Those orbits which are the least
stable under the external perturbation (i.e., which turn chaotic for the lowest values of the
driving ﬁeld amplitude, such as straight line orbits parallel to the ﬁeld polarization axis for
a linearly polarized drive) induce the largest ionization rates for their associated eigenstates.
Consequently, in this near-integrable regime of classical dynamics, it is possible to classify
the eigenstates of the atom in the ﬁeld through quantum numbers associated with the orbital
parameters of unperturbed Kepler ellipses, i.e. with the angular momentum and the Runge-

Lenz vector. An adiabatic invariant governs the slow evolution of these parameters under
external driving [4].

It should be noted, however, that a considerable part of experimental data has been
accumulated in experiments on Rydberg states of alkali atoms rather than of atomic hydrogen
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. A priori, a classical-quantum correspondence as brieﬂy sketched above for
atomic hydrogen cannot be established here, due to the absence of a well and uniquely deﬁned
classical Hamiltonian. In particular, the atomic core destroys the symmetry characteristic for
the hydrogen atom and the Runge-Lenz vector is no more a constant of motion.

Indeed, experimental data systematically suggest strongly enhanced ionization rates of
nonhydrogenic (i.e., low angular momentum) alkali Rydberg states as compared to atomic
hydrogen [5, 6, 7, 9, 10], though they also exhibit qualitatively similar features, e.g. of the
dependence of the ionization yield on the principal quantum number of the atomic state the
atoms are initially prepared in [9, 10]. On the other hand, a direct comparison of available
hydrogen and alkali data is somewhat questionable, since relevant experimental parameters
such as the interaction time of the atom with the ﬁeld are typically diﬀerent for diﬀerent
experiments. Furthermore, a rigourous theoretical treatment of alkali atoms exposed to
microwave ﬁelds was not accomplished until now.

It is the purpose of the present letter to outline such a rigourous treatment which allows for
the ﬁrst time for a direct comparison of hydrogen and alkali ionization dynamics under precisely
the same conditions, without adjustable parameters. First results of our numerical experiments
directly address the above question of quantum-classical correspondence for periodically driven
alkali atoms.

Theory. – Let us start with the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of a one-electron atom exposed
to a linearly polarized microwave ﬁeld of (constant) amplitude F and frequency ω, in length
gauge, employing the dipole approximation and atomic units:

H(t) =

+ Vatom(r) + F z cos ωt, r > 0.

As this Hamiltonian is periodic in time, we can use the Floquet theorem [11] to ﬁnd the
eigenstates (“dressed states”) of the atom in the ﬁeld. After integration over the solid angle
we have to solve the time-independent, radial eigenvalue equation

The additional quantum number k counts the number of photons that are exchanged between

ﬁeld polarization axis and remains a good quantum number, due to the rotational symmetry of
our problem around the ﬁeld axis. For all numerical results presented hereafter, its value was
ﬁxed to m = 0. As immediately obvious from the nondiagonal part of eq. (2), the interaction
with the linearly polarised microwave ﬁeld conserves the generalised parity Π = (−1)k+ℓ. This

just expresses the angular momentum transfer associated with the absorption (emission) of a
photon.

As a unique one-particle potential Vatom(r) for alkali atoms is unknown, we use a variant
[12] of R-matrix theory to describe the interaction of the outer electron with the atomic core.
Conﬁguration space is divided in two regions: In the internal region, 0 < r ≤ a, the external
ﬁeld is negligible compared to the ﬁeld created by the atomic core, and the details of the
interaction are unknown. With the help of quantum defect theory [13], the solution of eq. (2)
at r = a can be written as a linear combination of regular and irregular Coulomb-functions
sℓ,E(r) and cℓ,E(r),

Fℓ,E(r) = cos(πδℓ)sℓ,E(r) + sin(πδℓ)cℓ,E(r), r = a,

(4)

where the δℓ are the quantum defects [13] known from spectroscopic experimental data [14].
In the outer region, r > a, the diﬀerence between the actual atomic potential Vatom(r) and the
Coulomb potential −1/r can be neglected. However, the operator d2/dr2 is no more hermitian
in the reduced range a < r < ∞. To overcome this problem, a surface term δ(r − a)( ∂
∂r + Cℓ)
is added [12, 16] to the diagonal part of (2). The matching condition between inner and outer
region at r = a is incorporated in the constant Cℓ by deﬁning

Cℓ = (Fℓ,ε+kω(r))(−1) ∂
∂r

Fℓ,ε+kω(r).

(5)

Note that the function Fℓ,E(r) in eq. (4) has to be evaluated at the energy ε + kω in (5), i.e.
at diﬀerent energies for diﬀerent photon indices k. This generalizes the approach outlined in
[12] to periodically driven systems.

Finally, due to the continuum coupling induced by the external ﬁeld, all atomic bound states
turn into resonances with ﬁnite ionization rates Γǫ. In order to extract the latter together with
the energies ǫ of the atom in the ﬁeld, we use the method of complex scaling [15, 17]. After
this nonunitary transformation the Floquet Hamiltonian amended by the core induced surface
term (5) is represented by a complex symmetric matrix, with complex eigenvalues ε − iΓε/2.
These are obtained by diagonalization of the complex eigenvalue problem in a real Sturmian
basis, using an eﬃcient implementation of the Lanczos algorithm. Together with the associated
eigenvectors they provide a complete description of our problem [15].

Results. – The described theoretical/numerical apparatus is now applied to alkali atoms in
a microwave ﬁeld. Since we want to identify the core induced eﬀects in the alkali problem as
compared to the hydrogen spectrum, we use parameter values which have been employed in
earlier work on microwave driven Rydberg states [4, 15] of hydrogen. To keep the comparison
as transparent as possible, we focus on a microwave frequency ω = 1.07171794 × 10−4 a.u.
which is nonresonant with the hydrogen level spacing in the vicinity of the atomic initial state
with principal quantum number n0 = 23. The ﬁeld amplitude is ﬁxed to F = 1.072×10−7 a.u.,
slightly below the onset of appreciable (chaos-induced [2]) ionization of atomic hydrogen [4].
This choice of parameters deﬁnes a near-integrable phase space structure for the classical
dynamics of driven hydrogen, with an unambiguous signature in the associated quantum
energies emerging from the n0 = 23 manifold. The black dots in ﬁg. 1 illustrate the situation:
The driving ﬁeld lifts the angular momentum degeneracy of the substates of the manifold,
which reorganize according to their localization properties in classical phase space [4]. Those
states with maximum angular momentum and spherical symmetry experience the strongest
ﬁeld induced (“ac-”) shift in energy, whereas those with maximum radial component of the
Runge-Lenz vector and “λ-symmetry” [4, 18, 19] remain essentially unaﬀected by the external
perturbation. Since the low angular momentum states are strongly mixed by the ﬁeld (to

4

EUROPHYSICS LETTERS

build states with λ-symmetry [18, 19]), a new (semiclassical) quantum number p [4] is used to
label the n0 substates of the manifold in the ﬁeld. p is an integer ranging from 0 to n0 − 1,
and simply counts the number of quanta enclosed by a semiclassical contour integral along
the equipotential curves of the adiabatic Hamiltonian which generates the slow evolution
of angular momentum and Runge-Lenz vector of the classical Kepler ellipse under external
driving [4]. The associated eigenstates exhibit spherical symmetry for p = 0 . . . 9, and λ-
symmetry for p = 10 . . . 22, respectively [4]. Note that low and high p-values correspond to
negligible ionization rates of the atom in the ﬁeld, due to the classical stability of the associated
trajectories under external driving [4]. Actually, the λ-states with large p, which quantize a
classical straight line orbit perpendicular to the ﬁeld polarization axis, with maximum modulus
of the Runge-Lenz vector, display the smallest ionization rates [4].

In the presence of a non-hydrogenic core, the Runge-Lenz vector is no more a conserved
quantity and the λ-symmetry deﬁning associated eigenstates of the ﬁeld free atom [18] is
destroyed. Therefore, no symmetry argument is available to predict a similar (semiclassical)
organization of the alkali energy levels under external driving, alike the one observed for atomic
hydrogen [4].

Nonwithstanding, our results for lithium Rydberg states exposed to precisely the same
external perturbation as for the hydrogen results clearly show that the symmetry properties
of the driven Coulomb problem prevail even in the presence of the core. As evident from the
open triangles in ﬁg. 1 (a), the hydrogenic part of the lithium manifold exhibits globally the
same (semiclassical) structure as the hydrogen levels. For low values of p (≃ 0 . . . 9) this is not
surprising as the associated classical trajectories (large angular momenta) do not probe the
atomic core [4]. However, for large p-values (≃ 10 . . . 20), the classical solution of the Coulomb
problem does impinge on the nucleus and will certainly suﬀer scattering oﬀ the nonhydrogenic
core. Yet, in the presence of the ﬁeld, this scattering obviously mixes states of λ type only and
does not aﬀect the overall separation of the spectrum in spherical and λ states, as a remnant of
the classical phase space structure of the driven Coulomb dynamics. Neither does the presence
of the core appreciably aﬀect the ionization rates of the dressed states, as obvious from ﬁg. 1
(b). Only at p = 10 is there a local enhancement of the width (by approx. one order of
magnitude), due to the near resonant coupling of the state to the nonhydrogenic eigenstate
originating from |n = 41, ℓ = 0i, via a six-photon transition (similarly, a very weak mutliphoton
coupling slightly enhances the width of the p = 12 state). In the near integrable regime of the
classical Coulomb dynamics we are considering here it is precisely this kind of multiphoton
resonances between nonhydrogenic (low ℓ, such that δℓ 6= 0) states and hydrogenic manifolds
which provides a channel for enhanced ionization as compared to atomic hydrogen. Note that
without such a near resonant coupling, the non-hydrogenic states of a given manifold tend
to be more stable than the hydrogenic ones, as they are highly isolated in the spectrum. As
an example, for the same ﬁeld parameters, the lithium n0 = 23 ℓ = 0 (δℓ=0 = 0.399468) and
ℓ = 1 (δℓ=1 = 0.047263) [14] states exhibit ionization rates Γε ∼ 10−15 a.u. as small as the
most stable substates of the hydrogenic manifold of ﬁg. 1. A detailed analysis of enhanced
ionization via core-induced multiphoton resonances will be provided elsewhere.

Closer inspection of ﬁg. 1 (a) shows additional structure in the alkali spectrum, on top of
the globally hydrogen-like structure: for large values of p (≥ 11), the alkali levels are shifted
with respect to the hydrogenic energies. These shifts can be recovered by diagonalization of
the hydrogen problem within the restricted subspace spanned by the hydrogenic levels of the
alkali Rydberg manifold [19, 20, 21, 22]. In other words, the shifted energies are the solutions
of the eigenvalue equation

P HhydP |Φk0 i = (E + k0ω)|Φk0 i,

(6)

A. Krug and A. Buchleitner Residual Symmetries in the Spectrum of Periodically Driven Alkali Rydberg States 5

where Hhyd is obtained from from (1) setting Vatom(r) = −1/r, r ∈]0, ∞[, and P the projector
onto the hydrogenic subspace of the alkali manifold labeled by the principal quantum number
n0 and the photon number k0. Such a procedure is legitimate as long as the states emerging
from the nonhydrogenic part of the alkali manifold have vanishing overlap with the complete
hydrogen manifold emanating from (n0, k0). This condition is fulﬁlled for the driving ﬁeld
strength considered here.

Solving (6) for E is tantamount to ﬁnding the roots of

with Q = 1 − P the projector onto the orthogonal complement of the hydrogenic subspace for
given (n0, k0). Without loss of generality we choose k0 = 0 hereafter. Consequently, for one
single non-vanishing quantum defect δℓ0 , (7) becomes

where |n0, ℓ0i spans the orthogonal complement of the hydrogenic subspace of the alkali atom
within the (n0, k0 = 0) manifold. Note that (7) or (8) have to be evaluated for diﬀerent values
of the generalized parity Π, and that we have to solve (8) separately for ℓ0 = 0 and ℓ0 = 1, in
order to recover the level shifts observed for lithium in ﬁg. 1 (the ℓ0 = 2 and ℓ0 = 3 states of
lithium remain within the range of P , due to their negligible quantum defects δℓ=2 = 0.002129
and δℓ=2 = −0.000077 [14], at the given ﬁeld strength). Fig. 2 (a) shows the result of the
projection method, compared to the exact numerical result – the agreement is very good.
Since the low p states essentially exhibit spherical symmetry with large angular momentum
projection, their overlap with |n0, ℓ0 = 0(ℓ0 = 1)i vanishes and their energies remain unshifted
as compared to the hydrogen results.

The scenario which we described for lithium also applies for the heavier alkali elements, as
illustrated in ﬁgs. 2 (b) and (c). Here we plot the shifts of the exact energies of sodium and
rubidium with respect to the hydrogen levels, as they emerge from the n0 = 23 manifold, for
precisely the same ﬁeld parameters as used for the lithium results. Since for these elements
also the ℓ1 = 2 (sodium) and the ℓ1 = 3 (rubidium) states are separated from the hydrogenic
manifold due to their large quantum defects, the range of Q in (7) is two-dimensional and the
evaluation of the determinant yields the expression

Again, the solution of (9) gives very good agreement with the numerical result. In addition,
we note that the larger the dimension of the range of Q, the smaller the values of p for which
the alkali levels are shifted as compared to the hydrogen energies. This is a consequence of
the dominance of small ℓ components in large p states and of large ℓ components in small p
states, since the heavier the element the larger the ℓ values aﬀected by non-negligible quantum
defects.

Summary. – In conclusion, the energy levels of alkali Rydberg states emerging from the hy-
drogenic n0-manifold clearly reﬂect the phase space structure of the microwave driven Coulomb
problem, despite the presence of a symmetry breaking atomic core. Also the ionization rates
of the atoms reﬂect the underlying classical phase space structure, with the exception of local
enhancements due to multiphoton resonances with nonhydrogenic sublevels of other manifolds.

We have checked that the observed structure is robust under changes of the driving ﬁeld
amplitude, up to values where adjacent n-manifolds start to overlap.

Fig. 1. – Energies (a) and ionisation rates (b) of Rydberg states of lithium (triangles) and of atomic
hydrogen (dots) exposed to a linearly polarized microwave ﬁeld of frequency ω = 1.07171794×10−4 a.u.
and amplitude F = 1.072 × 10−7a.u., for principal quantum number n0 = 23 and angular momentum
projection m = 0 on the ﬁeld polarization axis. The lithium spectrum lacks two of the 23 substates
of the manifold, due to the quantum defects δℓ=0 = 0.399468 and δℓ=1 = 0.047263 of the ℓ = 0
and ℓ = 1 states, respectively. The quantum defects δℓ=2 = 0.002129 and δℓ=3 = −0.000077
are negligible compared to the ﬁeld induced splitting of the n0 = 23 manifold (ﬁeld-free energy
E23 ≃ −9.452×10−4 a.u.). Both spectra almost coincide (in energy and ionisation rate) even for larger
values (p ≥ 10) of the (semiclassical [4]) quantum number p, despite the fact that the localization
properties of the associated eigenstates (close to the plane deﬁned by the ﬁeld polarization axis)
originate in the dynamical symmetry of the −1/r Coulomb potential [18]. The latter is destroyed by
the presence of a nonhydrogenic core in alkali atoms. The ionization rate of the p = 10 state of lithium
is locally enhanced by approx. one order of magnitude with respect to the corresponding hydrogen
eigenstate, due to a six-photon resonance with the |n = 41, ℓ = 0i state.

Fig. 2. – Shifts Ealk − Ehyd of the energies Ealk of lithium (a, triangles), sodium (b, diamonds), and
rubidium (c, squares) as compared to those, Ehyd, of the n0 = 23 manifold of atomic hydrogen in a
linearly polarized microwave ﬁeld, with the same parameters as in ﬁg. 1. Quantum defects employed
for the sodium results: δℓ=0 = 1.347964, δℓ=1 = 0.85538, δℓ=2 = 0.015543, δℓ=3 = 0.001453, and for
rubidium: δℓ=0 = 3.1311, δℓ=1 = 2.6415, δℓ=2 = 1.3472, δℓ=3 = 0.016312 [14]. Consequently, three
respectively four energy levels are missing in (b) and (c). The nonvanishing shifts for large p ≥ 9 values
can be accounted for by projecting out the low ℓ components (i.e. the ones with core induced energy
shifts large with respect to the ﬁeld induced splitting of the n0 = 23 manifold) of the n0-manifold, as
indicated by the crosses, see eqs. (8) and (9). The agreement between this perturbative approach and
the exact quantum results is always better than the average level spacing of the hydrogen manifold
(dots in ﬁg. 1), except for the relatively large discrepancy at p = 11, in (c). The latter is due to a
multiphoton resonance between the alkali eigenstate and a nonhydrogenic (low ℓ) state.

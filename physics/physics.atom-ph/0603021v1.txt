INTRODUCTION

The precision in measurements of decay rates of forbidden transitions has considerably in-

creased during the last years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The accuracy achieved for the magnetic-dipole
(M1) transition (1s22s22p) 2P3/2 −
[6, 7]. This experimental precision demands a corresponding increase in the accuracy of the

2P1/2 in B-like Ar became better than one part per thousand

theoretical predictions. In a recent work [8] we have calculated the M1-transition probabilities be-

tween the ﬁne-structure levels in B- and Be-like ions within the region of nuclear charge numbers

Z = 16

22. In particular, it was found that the theoretical result for the case of Ar13+ deviates

−

from the experimental one by about 3σ.

In Ref. [8], the relativistic, interelectronic-interaction, and quantum-electrodynamic (QED) cor-

rections to the M1-transition amplitude were computed, while experimental values were taken

for the transition energies. The conﬁguration-interaction method in the Dirac-Fock-Sturm basis

(CIDFS) was employed in order to evaluate the interelectronic-interaction contribution. Correc-

tions due to single excitations to the negative-continuum energy states were taken into account in

the many-electron wave functions. As it is known from [9, 10], such corrections may be signiﬁcant

in calculations involving operators, which mix large and small components of the wave functions,

such as the M1-transition operator. The frequency-dependent term (consult the detailed descrip-

tion presented in Ref. [11]) was calculated within perturbation theory to ﬁrst order in 1/Z. The

QED correction was obtained within leading order by including the electron anomalous magnetic

moment (EAMM) in the M1-transition operator. Uncalculated higher-order QED terms together

with the experimental errors of the transition energy determine the total uncertainty of the theo-

retical predictions presented in Ref. [8]. In this work, which is aiming for improvements of the

evaluation of the radiative effects to the M1-transition probability in B-like ions, we present the

exact calculation of the one-electron QED corrections going beyond the EAMM approximation.

Accordingly, the bound-electron propagator is treated exactly. This approach was already em-

ployed for the evaluation of the radiative corrections to the decays 2p1/2, 2s, 2p3/2 −
genic ions [12] and parity nonconserving transitions in neutral Cs and Fr [13, 14]. Besides, in Ref.

1s in hydro-

[15] the QED corrections to the transition probability between the hyperﬁne-structure components

were expressed in terms of the corresponding corrections to the bound-electron g factor. The latter

ones were calculated to all orders in αZ for the 1s and 2s states in Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20].

Relativistic units (~ = c = m = 1) and the Heaviside charge unit [α = e2/(4π), e < 0] are

used throughout the paper.

In

further calculations we take into account only the ﬁrst term in the power expansion of j1(ωr),

since for the case under consideration the transition wavelength is much larger than a typical ion

size. Accordingly, the M1-transition operator T1 can be related to the magnetic moment operator

Utilizing the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the transition probability can be expressed in terms of the

reduced matrix element of T 1

M (see, e.g., Ref. [21]), which does not depend on the momentum
projection M. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient to calculate the transition amplitude for a given projection

M only. In what follows we take M = 0 and omit the corresponding subscript.

In this work we focus on the one-loop QED contributions to the transition amplitude beyond the

EAMM approximation. The vacuum-polarization (VP) and self-energy (SE) corrections, which

one needs to consider, are diagrammatically depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The VP

correction corresponding to the diagrams presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) (the electric-loop term)

has been calculated in the Uehling potential approximation. The diagram depicted in Fig. 1(c) (the

magnetic-loop term) has the magnetic-interaction insertion into the VP loop. It is known, that the

contribution of this diagram vanishes in the Uehling approximation. The higher-orders VP terms

turn out to be rather small and can be neglected. The remaining part of the work is devoted to the

SE correction. Here we present the formal expressions for the corresponding contributions, which

were derived at length in Ref. [22].

The contributions of the diagrams depicted in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are conveniently divided into

irreducible and reducible parts. The reducible (“red”) contribution of the diagram depicted in

Fig. 2(a) is deﬁned as a part in which the intermediate state energy εn = εa, respectively εn = εb

for the diagram presented in Fig. 2(b). The irreducible (“irr”) part is given by the remainder. The

latter one can be written in terms of nondiagonal matrix elements of the self-energy operator (see,

The irreducible part can be renormalized in the same manner as the ordinary SE correction

to the energy. This renormalization is well-known and discussed in details in [23, 24, 25]. The

ultraviolet divergence in the vertex and reducible contributions can be isolated by expanding the

bound-electron propagator in terms of the interaction with the ﬁeld of the nucleus. For our pur-

poses, it is convenient to decompose the total contribution into zero-, one-, and many-potential

terms according to the number of interactions with the external ﬁeld

and

∆Ared = ∆Ared(0) + ∆Ared(1) + ∆Ared(2+) .

(11)

This expansion for the vertex diagram is schematically presented in Fig. 3. In order to remove

the divergences in the vertex and reducible terms, we consider them together. Combining the

corresponding parts, we deﬁne

∆Avr(i) = ∆Aver(i) + ∆Ared(i) ,

(i = 0, 1, 2+) .

(12)

It can be shown, that the ultraviolet-divergent terms, which are present in ∆Aver(0) and ∆Ared(0),

cancel each other in ∆Avr(0). The remaining one- and many-potential terms are ultraviolet ﬁnite.

The zero- and one-potential contributions are evaluated in momentum space, while the many-

potential term is calculated in the coordinate space employing the partial-wave expansion. The

scheme for the separate treatment of the one-potential term was also used in previous g factor

calculations presented in Refs. [17, 18, 19, 20]. It improves considerably the convergence of

the partial-wave expansion in the low and middle Z region. The summarized expressions for the

reducible correction are similar to those derived for the g factor (see, Ref. [20]). However, for

the vertex contribution there are some principal differences. In contrast to Eq. (4) of Ref. [20],

two different energies εa and εb enter the denominator of formula (9) and the matrix element

las for the one-potential vertex contribution is somewhat more complicated. However, taking the

energy to be the same for both electron propagators (e.g., εa), the expressions for ∆Aver(1) can be

obtained in the same manner as for the g factor [20]. The remaining many-potential term can be

6

evaluated by the point-by-point subtraction of the corresponding zero- and one-potential contribu-

tions in the coordinate space. Consistently, we subtract the one-potential vertex contribution with

the same energy variable in the electron propagators as it is taken in the ∆Aver(1) term calculated

in the momentum space. Furthermore, the term with εn1 = εb and εn2 = εa in Eq. (9) has an

infrared divergence, which is canceled by the corresponding term of the reducible contribution.

For the numerical evaluation we employ the ﬁnite-basis-set method for the Dirac equation con-

structed via the dual kinetic balance approach [26]. The summation of the partial-wave expansion

= 10, while the remaining tail was approximated by a least-square

was performed up to

represents the electron anomalous magnetic factor corresponding to the EAMM term. In Table

I we present our results for the one-electron SE correction. The VP term calculated within the

Uehling approximation has been found to be negligible. The various contributions corresponding

to the SE corrections to the transition amplitude are given in Table I. The one- and many-potential

terms are represented as the sum δvr(1+) = δvr(1) + δvr(2+). As one can see from this table, the oc-

curring cancellation reduces the total value for the correction δ by an order of magnitude compared

to the individual terms. Most serious computational difﬁculties arise from the extrapolation of the

partial-wave expansion of the many-potential term. In order to estimate the error, we perform a

second evaluation of δvr(1+) without separating out the one-potential term. The difference between

the results of both calculations is taken for the uncertainty.

The obtained results allow for an improvement of the theoretical values of the M1-transition

correction ∆WQED, the total values of the transition probability Wtotal, and the lifetime τtotal are

compiled. For the transition energies we used the experimental values from Refs. [27, 28]. They

are presented in the second column of Table II. For S11+, Cl12+, K14+, and Ti17+ the uncertainties

of the values of Wtotal and τtotal are determined by the errors in the experimental transition ener-

gies. Thus the accuracy of the total results for these ions has not been improved in comparison

with the values presented in Ref. [8]. However, for Ar13+ the experimental value for the transition

energy is known with high precision [28] and the uncertainty of the predictions obtained in Ref. [8]

is determined by the uncalculated QED terms beyond the EAMM approximation. The present cal-

culation of the radiative correction ∆WQED has improved the accuracy of the total values of the
transition probability Wtotal and the lifetime τtotal for Ar13+ by an order of magnitude. Further-

more, for argon ion we have added the probability of the electric-quadrupole mode WE2 = 0.00194
s−1 calculated in Coulomb gauge in Ref. [29] to the total decay rate and lifetime.

In Table II, we also compare our total results with corresponding experimental data. The dis-

agreement with the most accurate experimental value for Ar13+ [6, 7] can be stated. The reason

for this discrepancy is still unclear for us.

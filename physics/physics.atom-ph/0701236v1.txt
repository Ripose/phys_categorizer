The highest precision in direct mass measurements is obtained with Penning trap mass spectrom-
etry. Most experiments use the interconversion of the magnetron and cyclotron motional modes
of the stored ion due to excitation by external radiofrequency-quadrupole ﬁelds.
In this work a
new excitation scheme, Ramsey’s method of time-separated oscillatory ﬁelds, has been successfully
tested. It has been shown to reduce signiﬁcantly the uncertainty in the determination of the cy-
clotron frequency and thus of the ion mass of interest. The theoretical description of the ion motion
excited with Ramsey’s method in a Penning trap and subsequently the calculation of the resonance
line shapes for diﬀerent excitation times, pulse structures, and detunings of the quadrupole ﬁeld has
been carried out in a quantum mechanical framework and is discussed in detail in the preceding
article in this journal by M. Kretzschmar. Here, the new excitation technique has been applied with
the ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer at ISOLDE/CERN for mass measurements on stable as well as
short-lived nuclides. The experimental resonances are in agreement with the theoretical predictions
and a precision gain close to a factor of four was achieved compared to the use of the conventional
excitation technique.

INTRODUCTION

The mass and its inherent connection with the atomic
and nuclear binding energy is an important property of
a nuclide. Thus, precise mass measurements are eminent
for various applications in many ﬁelds of physics [1, 2].
The required precision of the atomic mass depends on
the physics being investigated. For radionuclides, which
often have half-lives considerably less than a second, it
ranges from δm/m = 10−5 to below 10−8 and for stable
nuclides even down to δm/m = 10−11. Since the interest
in masses of short-lived and stable nuclides arises from
a wide range of applications with diﬀerent requirements
on the accuracy, a continuous development of e.g. new
ion detection and preparation techniques is carried on at
several facilities world-wide [3].

In 1949 N.F. Ramsey improved the molecular-beam
magnetic-resonance method of I.I. Rabi [6, 7] by applying
oscillatory ﬁelds to the transversing molecular beam in
spatially separated regions [8]. This replacement of the
uniformly applied ﬁeld led to a linewidth reduction to
60% and thus to a more precise determination of the
resonance frequency. For a detailed description see [8]
and references therein.

In high-precision mass spectrometry the idea to use
time-separated oscillatory ﬁelds to manipulate the radial

motions of conﬁned ions in a Penning trap was ﬁrst put
forward at ISOLTRAP by G. Bollen and coworkers in
1992 [9] and later tested at the SMILETRAP experi-
ment [10]. At this time the correct theoretical description
of the observed line-shapes was not available. Instead,
the observations were discussed qualitatively in terms
of the Fourier transform of the applied pulse sequence.
However, a study of the precision gain as well as on-
line mass measurements with the new excitation scheme
were not performed. In the preceding paper [11] a the-
oretical description of the obtained lineshape has been
developed in a quantum mechanical framework. In the
following, the corresponding experimental investigations
and the gain in linewidth and precision of the “Ramsey
method” will be presented.

II. THEORETICAL OVERVIEW

For a quick orientation we review here in a non-
technical manner the physical assumptions forming the
basis of the theoretical model, the approximations neces-
sary for analytical calculations, and the results that are
most important for mass spectrometry. Details are found
in the preceding article [11].

The quantized version of the theory provides a clear pic-
ture of the energy level scheme associated with the ion
motion in an ideal Penning trap (see Fig. 1). Therefore,
it is valuable for the identiﬁcation of the interaction with
the external rf-quadrupole ﬁeld that is used to convert
the magnetron motion into the cyclotron motion.

Real Penning traps generally possess some anhar-
monic perturbations that introduce nonlinear terms into
the equations of motion and couple the three motional
modes, thus preventing us from ﬁnding analytical solu-
tions for the ion motion. This problem can be minimized

Ion trajectories

While the viewpoint of quantum mechanics was very
helpful for the identiﬁcation of the relevant interaction,
it is in general suﬃcient for the application to mass spec-
trometry to consider the ion motion as a classical motion,
i.e. following trajectories of macroscopic scale. To work
out this aspect expectation values of the quantum me-
chanical operators are taken with respect to quasiclas-
sical coherent oscillator states. Thus, the annihilation
operators a+(t) and a−(t), obtained as solutions of the
Heisenberg equations of motion, are translated into two
complex functions α+(t) and α−(t) that are denoted as
the ‘complex oscillator amplitudes’ of the cyclotron and
magnetron oscillators at time t. The complex conjugate
functions α∗
−(t) correspond to the respective
creation operators. The explicite solution of the initial
value problem is [11]:

The application of a radiofrequency potential to the
four-fold segmented ring electrode (see Fig. 2) adds to
the Hamiltonian (3) new terms that are periodic with the
driving frequency νd = ωd/2π and have a phase χd. The
leading term in a multipolar expansion is the quadrupole
y2) cos(ωdt + χd), higher multipoles
contribution
must be minimized as they introduce non-linearities into
the equations of motion. In the quantized version of the
theory x and y are components of the position operator
of the ion and can be expressed in terms of the creation
and annihilation operators of the modiﬁed cyclotron and
magnetron motional modes. It then becomes apparent
that the quadrupole contribution actually describes three
physical processes: Most importantly the absorption of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld quantum ~ωd with simultane-
ous conversion of a magnetron oscillator quantum ~ω−
into a quantum of the cyclotron oscillator ~ω+, together
with the reverse transition. This process is dominant if
the driving frequency νd approximately satisﬁes the reso-

The real coupling constant g has the physical dimension
of a frequency. It is proportional to the amplitude of the
rf-quadrupole ﬁeld, but its value is also inﬂuenced by de-
tails of the trap geometry. As shown later, it determines
the conversion time τc = π/2g, which is deﬁned as the
time required for the full conversion of a state of pure
magnetron motion into a state of pure cyclotron motion
by a quadrupole ﬁeld at the resonance frequency ωc (see
ﬁnal results in Eq. (9)). For each magnetron quantum
~ω− that is annihilated (created) a cyclotron quantum
~ω+ is simultaneously created (annihilated). The inter-
action obviously conserves the total number of quanta
Ntot = N+ + N− present in the system and has no sim-
ple description in a purely classical picture. The other
two physical processes described by the quadrupole con-
tribution are the absorption (emission) of a ﬁeld quan-
tum ~ωd with simultaneous creation (annihilation) of two
quanta of the modiﬁed cyclotron oscillator (driving fre-
quency ωd ≈
2ω+), and the absorption (emission) of a
ﬁeld quantum ~ωd with simultaneous annihilation (cre-
ation) of two quanta of the magnetron oscillator (driving
frequency ωd ≈
2ω−) [12]. These two processes are neg-
ligible if ωd ≈
The ideal Penning trap with quadrupole excitation is
now described by the total Hamiltonian H(t) = H0 +
H1(t). The resulting Heisenberg equations of motion
for the operators a+(t) and a−(t) are linear and time-
dependent, they permit a general, exact solution. The
equations and their solutions correspond closely to those

ms Ramsey pulses. The excitation amplitude is chosen in a
way that at νc one full conversion from pure magnetron to
pure cyclotron motion is obtained. Thus the sum of the grey
colored areas is identical in all four schemes.

B. Excitation schemes

The precision in the determination of the cyclotron
frequency strongly depends on the width of the cen-
tral peak of the resonance. The narrower the reso-
nance, i.e. the smaller the full-width-at-half-maximum
(FWHM), the more precisely the center of the resonance
can be determined. The pronounced central peak, which
is clearly distinguishable from the usually smaller side
bands, marks the point of the maximal conversion and
thus of the maximal radial energy and the shortest time
of ﬂight from the trap to the detector. Ramsey’s method
of time-separated oscillatory ﬁelds promises to lead to

narrower central peaks compared to the conventional ex-
citation scheme. Therefore, a variety of diﬀerent Ramsey
excitation schemes were investigated with the aim of ﬁnd-
ing the one best suited for precision mass spectrometry.
In [11] the line shapes are discussed in the quantum me-
chanical formalism as probability distributions for the
partial conversion of a given initial state into a state of cy-
clotron motion. This general framework permits to take
into account diﬀerent assumptions on the initial state
as well as statistical hypotheses, for example on phases.
A more elementary approach consists in calculating the
time development of the radius of the cyclotron motion
R+(t) from the given initial conditions, using Eq. (5), (6),
and (7).

1. The one-pulse excitation scheme

In the conventional one-pulse excitation scheme the ex-
ternal driving ﬁeld is applied for a certain time interval
τ = τtot with constant amplitude, as shown in Fig. 4.
The lineshape represents the probability for the conver-
sion of an initially pure state of magnetron motion into
cyclotron motion as a function of the detuning δ of the
quadrupole ﬁeld. For given values of τ and g it is ob-
tained in the general formalism of [11] as

F1(δ; τ, g) =

4g2
ω2
R

sin2

ωR τ

(cid:16)

2 (cid:17)

.

(9)

Note that the maximum value 1 is reached when the
driving ﬁeld is at resonance, νd = νc, and the dura-
tion of the excitation is chosen to satisfy the condition
gτ = (2n + 1)π/2 with n = 0, 1, 2,.... In diﬀerent words,
at resonance (δ = 0) complete conversion of a pure mag-
netron state into a state of pure cyclotron motion is
achieved for excitation pulses of the duration of the ‘con-
version time’ τc = π/(2g) or odd multiples thereof.

This result can be veriﬁed by application of Eq. (5)
and (7) with the initial condition α+(0) = 0 and arbitrary
α−(0), and computing the time development of the radius
of modiﬁed cyclotron motion:

With respect to time the shape of the excitation pulse is
rectangular. Thus, in frequency space it is expected that
the excitation resembles the intensity (i.e. the modulus
squared) of the Fourier transform of a rectangular proﬁle,
namely (4g2/δ2) sin2(δτ /2). The actual lineshape, how-
ever, diﬀers in two important respects from this Fourier
transform: (a) At resonance (δ = 0) it is a periodic func-
tion of τ , describing the periodic conversion and recon-
version of the magnetron and modiﬁed cyclotron modes,
F1(δ = 0; τ, g) = sin2(πτ /τc), whereas the intensity of
the Fourier transform increases proportionally to τ 2. (b)
The central peak is actually narrower than for the Fourier
transform of a rectangle. This can be deduced from the
position δ0 of the zero that separates the central peak
from the ﬁrst satellite peak, (δ0τc)2 = 3π2 as compared
to (δ0τ )2 = 4π2 for the Fourier transform of the rectan-
gle, assuming τ = τc.

2. The two-pulse excitation scheme and more general
schemes

Although it is not obvious on ﬁrst sight, a close formal
analogy exists between nuclear magnetic resonance on
the one hand and the interconversion of the magnetron
and cyclotron motional modes of an ion in a Penning trap
due to quadrupole excitation on the other hand. This
was shown in [11] using the concept of a Bloch vector.

5

(11)

It is therefore reasonable to expect that the use of Ram-
sey’s method of separated oscillatory ﬁelds will lead to
increased precision in mass spectrometry too.

A symmetric n-pulse Ramsey cycle of a total duration
τtot consists of n excitation intervals of duration τ1 with
1) waiting intervals of duration τ0 in between, so that

the total cycle time is τtot = nτ1 + (n

This result and analogous ones for Ramsey excitation
cycles with 3, 4, and 5 pulses can be found in [11].
If the frequency of the quadrupole ﬁeld equals the cy-
clotron frequency νc and the amplitude of the ﬁeld is
chosen such that the n excitation intervals exactly add
up to the conversion time τc, i.e.
if the coupling con-
stant g satisﬁes the relation nτ1 = τc = π/2g, then the
proﬁle function (11) reaches the value 1 at resonance,
F2(δ = 0; τ0, τc/2, g) = 1.

An elementary derivation of the 2-pulse proﬁle function

three times successively to the time intervals 0

2τ1 + τ0 = τtot, with
τ1 ≤
the initial condition α+(0) = 0 and arbitrary α−(0), in
order to compute the endpoint of the time development
of the radius of the cyclotron motion, R+(τtot). The ﬁrst
calculation yields the initial values α±(τ1) for the wait-
ing period, the second calculation with g = 0 yields the
phase change during the waiting period and thus the ini-
tial values α±(τ1 + τ0) for the second excitation period,
the third step ﬁnally results in α±(2τ1 + τ0) = α±(τtot)
and thus in a result for the ﬁnal radius of the cyclotron
motion R+(τtot). Note that χd in Eq. (5) and (6) has
to be replaced in the second and third step by the corre-
sponding phases of the quadrupole ﬁeld, ωdτ1 + χd and
ωd(τ0 + τ1) + χd, respectively. The ﬁnal result is

tains the spectral lineshape of the 2-pulse Ramsey cycle.
It bears a resemblance to the Fourier transform of a signal

IMPLEMENTATION AT THE MASS
SPECTROMETER ISOLTRAP

A. Experimental setup

The triple-trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP [13, 14]
installed at the on-line facility ISOLDE/CERN [15, 16]
is dedicated to high-precision mass measurements of ra-
dioactive nuclides. It reaches a relative mass uncertainty
of below 10−8 [17]. A Paul trap and two Penning traps
are the main parts of the apparatus as shown in Fig. 6.
The ions from the continuous 60-keV radioactive beam of
ISOLDE or from the stable alkali ion source are captured
in-ﬂight by a gas-ﬁlled linear Paul trap with segmented

FIG. 6:

cision Penning traps, as well as the reference ion source. In
the inset a resonance for 39Ca19F+ ions with an excitation
period of 900 ms is shown. To monitor the ion transfer and
to record the time-of-ﬂight resonance for the determination
of the cyclotron frequency, micro-channel-plate (MCP) detec-
tors or a channeltron are used.

rods [18]. Here, the ions are accumulated, cooled, and
bunched. From the Paul trap the ions are guided, after
passing two pulsed drift tubes in order to reduce the po-
tential energy from 60 keV to about 100 eV, to a buﬀer-
gas ﬁlled cylindrical Penning trap [19]. This preparation
trap is located in a superconducting magnet of 4.7-T ﬁeld
strength. Here, the ions are mass-selectively cooled [20]
with a resolving power of up to 105. Thus, an isobar-
ically clean ion cloud is obtained, which is transferred
to the precision Penning trap. This hyperbolic Penning
trap [14], which is placed in a second superconducting
magnet of 5.9-T ﬁeld strength with a ﬁeld homogeneity of
10−7 to 10−8 within one cubic centimeter and a temporal
stability of δB
10−9/h, provides the possibility to
B
resolve even low-lying excited nuclear states [21, 22] and
serves for the actual mass measurement of nuclides with
half-lives even below 100 ms [23, 24].
In order to manipulate the ion motion in the precision
trap by the application of external rf-ﬁelds, the ring elec-
trode of the trap is four-fold segmented, as illustrated in
Fig. 2. First, the magnetron radius of all ions is increased
via a dipolar excitation at the magnetron frequency [25].
If required, there is the possibility to remove unwanted
contaminations via a mass-selective dipolar excitation at
the corresponding modiﬁed cyclotron frequency. Thereby

1
δt ≈

·

the ions’ cyclotron radius is increased until the ions hit
the electrode and are lost. A quadrupolar excitation at
νc converts the magnetron motion into cyclotron motion.
Finally, the ions are ejected out of the trap and pass the
gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld, which interacts with the
orbital magnetic moment of the ions and accelerates them
in the axial direction to the detector. This acceleration
is proportional to the strength of the ions’ magnetic mo-
ment, i.e. to the radial energy obtained by the excita-
tion. The time of ﬂight after ejection from the trap to
the detector is measured. This procedure is repeated for
diﬀerent frequencies of the quadrupolar excitation in the
precision trap around the expected value of the cyclotron
frequency. By the determination of the mean time of
ﬂight for the diﬀerent excitation frequencies a time-of-
ﬂight resonance curve is recorded (see inset of Fig. 6).
For appropriate excitation parameters the minimum time
of ﬂight is measured at the cyclotron frequency [26]. For
reference measurements, i.e. to calibrate the magnetic
ﬁeld, ions with well-known mass from a stable alkali ion
source are used.
The experimental standard deviation σ(νc) of the cy-
clotron frequency νc is a function of the resolving power
of the precision trap, i.e.
the quadrupolar excitation
time Tq, and the total number Ntot of recorded ions.
The resolving power is Fourier limited by the duration
of the quadrupolar excitation, which itself is limited by
the half-life of the ion of interest in case of short-lived
radionuclides. An empirical formula [27] describes this
relation:

σ(νc)

where c is a dimensionless constant. In a large number
of measurements with carbon clusters the constant c was
determined for the ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer to be
c = 0.898(8) [17].

B. Reduction of the line-width

Having discussed the standard quadrupolar excitation,
what is the advantage of Ramsey’s method of time-
separated oscillatory ﬁelds? In many experimental sit-
uations, the total time available for a complete mea-
surement cycle has an upper limit, for example due to
the lifetime of the radioactive species under investiga-
tion. Thus, a precision gain simply by increasing the
waiting time τ0 may not be feasible due to experimen-
tal limitations. Therefore, diﬀerent excitation schemes
are compared with respect to the predicted width of the
central peak, assuming that a total time τtot is available
to perform one complete Ramsey measuring cycle. For a
1)τ0,
symmetric n-pulse excitation it is τtot = nτ1 + (n
where τ1 denotes the duration of an excitation interval
and τ0 the duration of a waiting interval. For τ1 = τc/n
and an excitation at resonance a complete conversion of

a pure magnetron state into a pure state of cyclotron mo-

A suitable parameter to describe the width of the central
peak is the position δ(n)
of the zero separating the central
peak from the ﬁrst side band. For a one-pulse excitation
(δ(1)
0 τtot)2 = 3π2. Therefore, for an n-pulse excitation
the variable y =
represents
the ratio of the zeros for n-pulse and 1-pulse excitation.
To a very good approximation this variable equals the
ratio of the full-width-half-maximum of the two excita-
tion schemes. In Fig. 7 these ratios have been plotted
for n = 2, 3, 4 as a function of x = (n
1)τ0/τtot, i.e.
the percentage of the total cycle time τtot spent during
waiting periods. From the graph it is obvious that with
60% the two-pulse excitation scheme oﬀers the largest
width reduction relative to a one-pulse excitation. This
excitation scheme is therefore favored for the application
in high-precision mass spectrometry.

sary to convert the theoretical line shapes for the energy

cussed in the following. The kinetic energy in the radial

ﬂight of the ions from the trap to the detector is plotted
as a function of the frequency detuning δ′ = δ/2π with
respect to the cyclotron frequency νc.

IV. RESULTS

To conﬁrm the calculations, i.e. to determine the line-
width reduction and, most importantly, to specify the
precision gain due to the Ramsey excitation method,
more than 300 time-of-ﬂight resonance curves with diﬀer-
ent excitation schemes were recorded with the Penning
trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP. The ion species for
all measurements was 39K+ provided by the stable al-
kali oﬀ-line ion source. Each resonance consists of about
2500 ions in order to have identical statistics. To min-
imize ion-ion interactions only time of ﬂight measure-
ments with at most ﬁve ions in the trap were taken into
account. The eﬀorts were concentrated on the speciﬁ-
cation of the uncertainty in the frequency determination
for diﬀerent excitation schemes. Figure 10 shows time-
of-ﬂight cyclotron resonances for the one-, two-, three-,
and four-pulse excitation scheme. A ﬁt of the theoreti-
cally expected line shape (solid line) to the data points
allows the determination of the FWHM and the cyclotron
frequency νc along with its uncertainty δνc. To perform
these ﬁts the standard evaluation program of ISOLTRAP
[17] was extended in order to analyze the measured cy-

clotron resonances using the Ramsey method.
The ﬁt results concerning the FWHM are presented in
Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. Figure 11 shows results obtained
with a two-pulse excitation scheme of diﬀerent overall cy-
cle times (τtot = 300 ms, 600 ms, 900 ms). The FWHM
is given as a function of the waiting period. Due to ﬁeld
inhomogeneities and ion-ion interactions the data points
are shifted slightly to higher FWHM values compared to
theory. Similar results are shown in Fig. 12 for diﬀer-
ent numbers of excitation pulses, where the total cycle
time in the precision trap is constant τtot = 300 ms. The
experimental values are on average 0.1 Hz higher than
the theoretical ones. This line-broadening eﬀect is due
to the electric and magnetic ﬁeld imperfections and ion-
ion interactions, which were not taken into account in
the calculations described above. A signiﬁcant reduction
of the FWHM for shorter excitation pulses with longer
waiting periods in between can be observed.
In Tab. I the experimental results are summarized. “cy-
cle time” is the duration of the total cycle. The maxi-
mum FWHM is the one of the standard one-pulse reso-
nance curve. The minimum FWHM is measured using
the longest possible waiting time, i.e.
shortest possi-
ble excitation time, which is determined by the maximal
possible amplitude of the quadrupolar excitation ﬁeld re-
quired to obtain one full conversion from pure magnetron
to pure cyclotron motion. The last column of Tab. I gives
the maximum line-width reduction (reduction gain=
(max. FWHM - min. FWHM)/max. FWHM) using
the diﬀerent Ramsey excitation schemes. A remarkable

reduction of close to 40% of the normal line-width is
observed, similar to the results in the original work of
Ramsey [8]. The reduction in line-width is especially im-
portant in context with the achievable resolving power
R = m/∆m = ν/∆ν. As theoretically predicted, the
largest possible reduction is obtained by a two-pulse ex-
citation scheme. However, the relative gain in reduction
depends only weakly on the total cycle time τtot (see
Tab. I and Fig. 11).

In Fig. 13 the experimental uncertainty δνc of the
measured cyclotron frequencies for diﬀerent numbers of
pulses and diﬀerent length of the total cycle time is plot-
ted versus the waiting time τ0. Each data point repre-
sents the mean value of three to ten individual measure-
ments. The uncertainty δνc decreases with increasing

FWHM at longer waiting times.
If the cyclotron fre-
quency uncertainty would only depend on the FWHM,
a similar behavior as observed in Fig. 12 would be ex-
pected. However, as mentioned before, it is obvious that
there is also an eﬀect of the overall line-shape, especially
of the steepness of the curve and the pronounced side-
bands, on the uncertainty in the frequency determination
of νc.
The excitation scheme used for the data points given in
Fig. 13 (a) consists of two, three, and four pulses, where
the total excitation cycle is ﬁxed to 300 ms. The un-
certainty is obviously decreasing for shorter excitation
pulses, i.e. longer waiting times τ0. In case of the two-
pulse excitation it can be reduced by more than a factor

The result is summarized in Tab. II, where the max-
imal and the minimal uncertainty for all investigated
excitation schemes under identical experimental condi-
tions are listed. As for the investigation of the FWHM,
the scheme where the largest reduction in the cyclotron
frequency uncertainty can be achieved is the two-pulse
Ramsey scheme. Comparing the two-pulse excitation
scheme with 300 ms, 600 ms, and 900 ms total cycle
time, the tendency is similar to the results obtained for
the FWHM of the resonances (see Fig. 13 (b)). The

longer total cycle times must be assigned to the relative
decrease of the statistical uncertainty in comparison to
the constant systematic uncertainty. Unsymmetric exci-

diﬀerent lengths have also been investigated. However,
the symmetric two-pulse excitation scheme remains the
best one in respect to line-width reduction and uncer-

δνc = 32 mHz. Fig. 14 shows a resonance of the same

where a two-pulse Ramsey excitation scheme was used.
The two excitation pulses had a duration of 100 ms in-
terrupted by a waiting period of 700 ms. Thus, the total
time τtot = 900 ms for which the ions remained in the
trap was identical. Here, the cyclotron frequency was
determined with an uncertainty of only δνc = 9 mHz.
In comparison, the statistical error in the frequency de-
termination could be reduced by more than a factor of
three, keeping the number of ions and the storage time
constant. This is a tremendous gain factor, especially for
mass measurements on short-lived radionuclides since the
required measurement time to reach a certain statistical
uncertainty can be reduced by almost an order of mag-
nitude.

The experimental studies described in this paper
demonstrate that Ramsey’s method of time-separated os-
cillatory ﬁelds can be applied to excite the ion motion in
a Penning trap. The Ramsey technique improves signif-
icantly the statistical uncertainty in high-precision mass
spectrometry on short-lived radionuclides. We performed
systematic experimental investigations for diﬀerent ex-
citation patterns with two, three, and four excitation
pulses. We observed the expected reduction of the line
width of almost a factor of two along with a gain in pre-
cision in the frequency determination. This leads to an
important gain in precision of the frequency determina-
tion. The new ﬁndings were demonstrated for a stable
nuclide as well as for a short-lived radionuclide in an on-
line measurement.

An optimized Ramsey excitation scheme with two
pulses of short duration interrupted by a long waiting
period results in an improvement of the statistical un-
certainty in the cyclotron-frequency determination by
more than a factor of three compared to the conventional
scheme, without any further experimental changes as e.g.
the number of detected ions for a resonance or reduction
of scan detuning width. Since the Ramsey method opens
a door to higher precision in Penning trap mass spec-
trometry, the application in other Penning trap setups
is already in preparation and under investigation, as e.g.
at SMILETRAP (Stockholm) using highly-charged sta-
ble ions [10] or at SHIPTRAP (GSI, Darmstadt) using
short-lived ﬁssion fragments [29]. It can be expected that
the Ramsey method will ﬁnd a wide-spread application
in high-precision mass spectrometry of atomic nuclei.

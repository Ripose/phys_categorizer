It is shown that the two-step excitation scheme typically used to create an ultracold Rydberg gas
can be described with an eﬀective two-level rate equation, greatly reducing the complexity of the
optical Bloch equations. This allows us to solve the many-body problem of interacting cold atoms
with a Monte Carlo technique. Our results reproduce the Rydberg blockade eﬀect. However, we
demonstrate that an Autler-Townes double peak structure in the two-step excitation scheme, which
occurs for moderate pulse lengths as used in the experiment, can give rise to an antiblockade eﬀect.
It is observable in a lattice gas with regularly spaced atoms. Since the antiblockade eﬀect is robust
against a large number of lattice defects it should be experimentally realizable with an optical lattice
created by CO2 lasers.

The prediction of a blockade eﬀect in the Rydberg ex-
citation of ultracold gases due to long-range interaction
[1] has sparked several experiments which have demon-
strated the blockade eﬀect under diﬀerent circumstances.
In [2] Rydberg excitation to n = 30–80 was achieved by a
single photon of a pulsed UV laser from the 5s Rb ground
state. In [3, 4] a two-step scheme is used where a strong
pump laser drives the 5s-5p transition of Rb atoms while
a tunable second laser excites from 5p to a Rydberg nℓ
state. In all three cases a suppression of the excitation
has been observed as a function of increasing laser in-
tensity or/and density of the gas, i.e., as a function of
increasing eﬀective interaction between the atoms which
shifts the energy levels out of resonance with the laser
light.

However, the two diﬀerent excitation schemes (single
UV pulse and two-step excitation) have a very diﬀerent
nature and may lead to dramatic diﬀerences in the block-
ade behavior. In fact, as we will show below, the two-
step scheme (see Fig. 1) may even induce an antiblockade
eﬀect due to the form of the single Rydberg atom pop-
ulation Pe(t, ∆) as a function of the detuning ∆ from
resonant excitation. This antiblockade eﬀect will only be
uncovered by a structured ultracold gas, e.g., a lattice gas
with atoms regularly placed on a 3-dimensional lattice.
Yet, the condition on the regular arrangement is not too
strict: even with 20 % lattice defects the antiblockade is
still visible.

The key to the antiblockade eﬀect is the excitation dy-
namics of the ﬁnal Rydberg state nℓ in a three-level sys-
(ground state)
tem with the transition between level

and level

tions [5] for transitions in this three-level system reduce
to a rate equation for a two-level system which contains

The reason for this simpliﬁcation lies in the strong de-
cay Γ which damps out coherences relatively fast and
ultimately allows for the rate description which directly

We use the simple picture as formulated in [7] for Rb.
A pair of Rydberg atoms in state ab at distance R ex-
periences a shift δ(R) of its electronic energy due to an
induced dipole coupling V (R) = µaa′µbb′ /R3 to an ener-
getically close state a′b′. It is given by the eigenvalues

pairs.

fraction of Rydberg atoms with increasing level shift δ,
here realized through increasing excitation n. This is the
typical blockade eﬀect, observed in [2, 3].

The parameters of Fig. 3 are close to those of the ex-
periment [3]. However, for those parameters, the single
atom excitation probability Pe(t, ∆) diﬀers qualitatively
from the one shown on the left part of Fig. 2. It has a
double peak structure due to an Autler-Townes splitting
induced by the strong driving Ω, as can be seen on the
right part of Fig. 2, with maxima at ∆ =
∆m. Due to
the wide distribution of mutual atomic distances R in a

To make the eﬀect of the double peak in the excitation
proﬁle visible, one needs a situation where the distribu-
tion of mutual atomic distances of the atom is restricted.
This can be achieved, e.g., with a lattice gas, i.e., with
atoms regularly spaced on a three dimensional lattice.
The fraction of excited atoms on a simple cubic lattice
with a lattice constant a = 5µm is shown in Fig. 4. One

can see the known Rydberg blockade but on top of it an
antiblockade eﬀect, i.e., an enhanced fraction of excited
atoms for certain values of n. A closer look at Fig. 4
reveals that there are even satellite peaks next to the
main peaks. This pattern of peaks is easily understood
if one analyzes the geometry of the atoms placed on a
cubic lattice (see Fig. 5). The shift in the Rydberg level
of a ground state atom is dominantly induced by a Ry-
dberg atom located on the next lattice site at a distance
of the lattice constant a. Hence we may write for the
shift δ(a; n). For a certain n of the Rydberg atom this
shift matches the detuning ∆m needed for maximum ex-
citation rate (see right part of Fig. 2), which leads to a
peak in Fig. 4. As experimentally also done, by changing
the laser intensity we can reach diﬀerent n keeping the
Rabi frequency ω constant. Clearly, with diﬀerent ni the

at a diﬀerent distance ai, so that in general

δ(ai; ni) = ∆m .

The obvious candidates in a cubic lattice apart from
the nearest neighbor at a1 = a are the neighbors along
the diagonal at a2 = √2a and along the cubic diago-
nal at a3 = √3a.

quantum numbers ni from Eq. (4), one would predict

which are

Of course, for the longer pulses the interaction is stronger
with a considerable amount of excited atoms. This back-
ground of excited atoms leads to a general shift of the
peaks towards lower n.

In addition to the main peaks described, satellite peaks
can be seen to the left of the main peaks. They corre-
spond to a situation where two Rydberg atoms on each
side of a central atom contribute half to the shift of the
excited level of the central atom, see Fig. 5. Of course, for
this enhancement less interaction is necessary than in the
nearest neighbor enhancement. Therefore these satellite
peaks appear at smaller n, to the left of the main peaks.
Since double the number of Rydberg atoms is necessary,
the satellite peaks are roughly only half the height of the
main peaks in the linear regime of low concentration of
Rydberg atoms (short laser pulse, solid curve in Fig. 3).
5µm can
be produced by CO2 lasers [9], but probably can only
be ﬁlled leaving a signiﬁcant amount of lattice defects.
Therefore, we have simulated a situation with 20% ran-
dom lattice defects. The defects hardly diminish the
contrast of the antiblockade eﬀect in the fraction of ex-
cited atoms (Fig. 4b), since the antiblockade relies dom-
inantly on contributions from pairs of close neighbors: If
a neighbor is missing due to a lattice defect this does
neither lead to antiblockade nor to blockade and there-
fore does not spoil fe. The large tolerance with respect
to lattice defects makes an experimental veriﬁcation of
the antiblockade feasible, depending on the appropriate

combination of Rabi frequencies, pulse length and decay
rate Γ. The corresponding “phase diagram” with the
boundary between the single peak (blockade) and double
peak (antiblockade) domain is shown in Fig. 6. The rate
equation Eq. (1) reveals that for large γt/P∞, the expo-
nential is suppressed and the steady state probability P∞
dominates, giving rise to a single peak structure. On the
other hand, for small γt/P∞ the Rydberg population is
governed by γ which gives rise to a double peak struc-
ture. The rate γ as well as P∞ take a relatively simple
form in the limit ω

with g0 = Γtω2/Ω2. Equation (6) is easily solved by it-
eration to give g0 = 2.513. Hence, for Ω
ω we expect
a linear line ω = αΩ separating the two regimes, where
α2 = g0/(tΓ) which is indeed the case (dashed lines in
Fig. 6). Note also, that Eq. (5) clearly demonstrates the
transient character of the double peak structure which
vanishes for long laser pulses. Yet, experimentally acces-
sible parameters, e.g., in [3], realize exactly the transient
regime and therefore provide the conditions to see the
antiblockade.

To summarize, we have derived a rate equation for the
population of Rydberg states in ultracold gases by a two-

4

step excitation process. The rate describes very well the
structure of the Rydberg excitation in a single atom when
compared to the exact solution of the Bloch equations
including a non-trivial transient Autler-Townes splitting
in the Rydberg population for certain parameters.

The validity of the rate equation has allowed us to for-
mulate the many-body excitation dynamics of Rydberg
states in an ultracold gas without a mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mation [2] and for a realistic number of atoms [12] as a
random Monte Carlo process. We can reproduce the ob-
served Rydberg blockade eﬀect observed previously and
also its eﬀect on the atom counting statistics [10] as mea-
sured in [4], but in addition we have identiﬁed an an-
tiblockade eﬀect due to the Autler-Townes splitted Ryd-
berg population. We predict that this antiblockade eﬀect
can be seen in an experiment with a gas trapped in an
optical lattice created by a CO2 laser since the antiblock-
ade eﬀect is robust even against a large number of lattice
defects. In the (realistic) limit of a very small upper Rabi
frequency ω we could show that the formation of the dou-
ble or single peak structure in the Rydberg population is
determined by a universal parameter which allows a sim-
ple navigation in parameter space consisting of the two
Rabi frequencies, the decay rate of the intermediate level
and the pulse length, to achieve the desired peak struc-
ture in the single-atom Rydberg excitation probability.

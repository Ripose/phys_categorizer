Abstract. A two-dimensional model atom is employed to study the ionization
behavior of initially excited atomic states in highly-frequent intense laser pulses beyond
the dipole approximation. An additional regime of ionization suppression is found
at laser intensities where the stabilization eﬀect is expected to break down. The
appearance of this eﬀect is due to a strong coupling of the initial wave function to
the ground state of the cycle-averaged space-translated ionic potential, followed by
a subsequent population transfer to the ground state during the laser pulse turn-oﬀ.
Non-dipole eﬀects are found to increase the overall ionization probabilities, but not to
suppress or alter this eﬀect.

In recent years, the rapid progress in laser technology has enabled the research
on highly nonperturbative phenomena of atoms in intense laser ﬁelds, such as Above
Threshold Ionization (ATI) or High Harmonic Generation (HHG) [1]. With the advent
of Free Electron Lasers (FEL) [2], light sources will soon be available to generate photons
whose energy ¯hω may equal or even exceed the binding energies of ground state atoms.
At such high frequencies, the atom may stabilize against ionization [3], such that the
ionization probability must not necessarily rise with the laser intensity, but it may
decrease even though the intensity is increased. The stabilization eﬀect and dynamic
ionization suppression have been extensively studied in one-electron atoms [4], and also
two-electron systems have been considered [5]. Stabilization of initially excited atomic
states has been of interest since they provide a means to fulﬁll the condition of high
laser frequencies, that is, within these systems the energy of a single photon exceeds
the electronic binding energy. Theoretical investigations have been carried out on the
ionization of 2s and 2p states of hydrogen [6], while the existence of the stabilization
eﬀect has been experimentally veriﬁed on Rydberg states [7].

In this letter, we study the ionization dynamics of an initially excited model atom
subjected to short, highly intense laser pulses whose frequency exceeds the atomic

ground state binding energy. Next to the stabilization eﬀect of the atom, which is
expected to occur at the laser parameters employed in our calculations, a second stage
of ionization suppression at higher ﬁeld strengths can be observed, which becomes more
pronounced for longer laser pulses. This eﬀect can be understood by means of a quasi-
static picture, where the initially excited atomic state couples strongly to the ground
state of the time-averaged Kramers-Henneberger potential. Furthermore, an alternative
picture is employed where the suppression eﬀect is explained in terms of the evolution
of the central regions with small probabilities of the excited state wave packet.

A two-dimensional model atom [8, 9] has been employed in our calculations, which
allows for the inclusion of non-dipole eﬀects of the laser. The electronic wave packet is
restricted to the plane spanned by the laser polarization and propagation direction. To
account for the reduced dimensionality of the system, the atomic potential is described
by a two-dimensional soft-core potential [10] (atomic units are used)

a.u., and will be used as initial state with probability density displayed in Fig. 1
(a). The wave function then is propagated with respect to time using the split-operator
method [8,11]. The interaction with the linearly polarized laser pulse is described by the
vector potential A(r, t) which, due to its spatial dependence, accounts for the retardation
of the laser. Both A as well as the electric ﬁeld along the laser polarization direction are
continuous and chosen to have a trapezoidal envelope, while it is ensured that no purely
ﬁeld-induced net momentum is transferred to the electron after the interaction with the
pulse, i.e. the time integral over the pulse vanishes [12]. In the following, we restrict
the duration of the turn-on and turn-oﬀ stages of the pulses to one optical cycle each,
while the length of the intermediate stage at constant amplitude is varied. High laser

Figure 2. Ionization probabilities of the ﬁrst excited state as a function of the peak
electric ﬁeld strength E0 at a frequency ω = 3 a.u. for three diﬀerent pulse lengths.
Trapezoidal pulse envelopes have been employed in the calculations, with one optical
cycle linear turn-on and turn-oﬀ in each case, and central portions of length one, four
and seven cycles, respectively.

frequencies of ω = 3 a.u. are considered, such that the energy of one photon exceeds
even the ionic ground state energy, and stabilization may occur. The crucial quantity
we wish to observe after the atom has been exposed to a laser pulse is the ionization
probability. Since the calculations of all the bound as well as the free states of the atom
is far too complex to obtain a good enough resolution, we employ an alternative scheme
to deﬁne the ionization probability. At every point of the numerical grid we calculate
the sum of potential and kinetic energy. If the total energy is positive, the portion of
the electronic wave packet stored on the respective point of the grid is expected to leave
the vicinity of the nucleus and ﬁnally become ionized. The validity of this method has
been veriﬁed by explicitly projecting out a series of previously calculated bound states
before calculating the ionization probability with the method described above, which
quantitatively yields the same results.

In Fig. 2 the ionization probabilities of the excited model atom are displayed
for three diﬀerent pulse lengths, where the number of turn-on and turn-oﬀ cycles has
been kept ﬁxed at one each, while the length of the centre portions of the pulse at
constant peak amplitude E0 has been varied. For all three pulses strong deviations
of the ionization probabilities from a monotonic increase with ﬁeld strength can be
observed for E0 > 10 a.u., and stabilization sets in. While for the shortest pulse of three
cycles total duration mere saturation of the ionization probabilities can be observed,
for longer pulse durations a decrease clearly sets in. At ﬁeld strengths E0 > 20 a.u.
the atomic stabilization breaks down, and the ionization probabilities again tend to
increase with the laser intensity [13]. However, for total pulse durations of more than
than six cycles, an additional decrease in the ionization probabilities is observable for
ﬁeld strengths of about E0 = 35 a.u., which is not present in the case of the ground
state of the atomic system. Our calculations have shown that this eﬀect persists for

Letter to the Editor

even longer pulse durations, while it gradually diminishes when the length of the turn-
on and turn-oﬀ of the laser pulses is increased. To understand the origins of this eﬀect,
we switch into the eigensystem of the unperturbed electron in the laser ﬁeld, described
quantum-mechanically by the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation [14], in which
the electron at rest is subject to the oscillating atomic potential. This frame has been
adopted successfully to explain the stabilization eﬀect, where at high laser frequencies
the electronic wave packet tends to occupy the ground state ΦKH of the time-averaged
KH potential, V KH(r). This is a double-well potential with the two wells separated by
twice the quiver amplitude α0 = E0/ω2 along the laser polarization direction ˆǫ, and can
be calculated by time-averaging over one laser period T = 2π/ω via

V KH(r) =

VSC(r + α0 cos (ωt) ˆǫ) dt .

This explains why the stabilization eﬀect at ﬁeld strengths E0
20 a.u., Fig. 2, becomes
more pronounced with the pulse duration, since with longer pulses the electron evolves
more eﬀectively into the ground state of the averaged KH potential. For the second
ionization suppression eﬀect at about E0 = 40 a.u. a diﬀerent mechanism comes into
play. The initially excited population gradually evolves into the ground state of V KH,
while being transferred into the ﬁeld-free atomic ground state during the rapid turn-oﬀ
of the laser pulse.

≈

In Fig. 3 (a), in addition to the ionization probabilities after interaction with a
1-7-1 pulse the expectation value of the overlap operator O =
between the
initially excited 2s state and the 1s state in the state ΦKH is displayed. This expectation
value is given by

In these terms, the ground state in the potential V KH mediates the laser-assisted
population transfer from the initial to the ﬁeld-free ground state. Even though this
representation by overlap matrix elements provides only a rough estimate of the
underlying mechanism, since the time-dependence of the process is neglected, the
position of the maximum of this quantity coincides well with the ﬁeld strength at
which the ionization suppression eﬀect occurs. This view is further corroborated when
considering the overlap between the time-dependent wave function and the ﬁeld-free
ground state, Fig. 3 (b). One clearly sees that between the beginning of the turn-oﬀ of
the laser pulse at eight cycles and the end of the pulse, at ﬁeld strengths about E0 = 40
a.u., the population transfer to the ground state is enhanced, leading to the eﬀective
suppression of ionization in this intensity regime.

The appearance of the ionization suppression eﬀect can also be understood by
considering the evolution of the laser-driven wave packets in time. Displayed in Fig. 4
are density proﬁles of the wave functions along the laser polarization axis, i.e. for y = 0.
When driven by the laser pulse, the wave packets lose their initial shape exhibiting three
1.2 a.u., and evolve to functions showing
distinct maxima separated by nodes at x =
a doubly-peaked structure, Fig. 4 (a), (b). At E0 = 30 a.u., the wave function at t = 8

cycles exhibits substantial probability density in the area around the nucleus. During
the turn-oﬀ of the laser pulse, the density proﬁle evolves to a shape showing a minimum
in the vicinity of the origin. This is in contrast to the wave function during the turn-oﬀ
of the laser pulse in the case E0 = 40 a.u., Fig. 4 (b). At t = 8 cycles, the position
of the wave function minimum is closer to the origin than for E0 = 30 a.u., and the
absolute value of the density probability is smaller than in Fig. 4 (a), therefore only
a small portion of the electronic wave packet is located in the vicinity of the nucleus.
Consequently, the ionization cross section is reduced, such that population is transferred
to the ground state of the potential during the ramping oﬀ of the pulse. This can also
be deduced from Fig. 4 (b) at t = 9 cycles, where the density shows a peak at the
origin, similar to the 1s state. The ionization suppression eﬀectively works for laser
pulses longer than six optical cycles duration, as can be seen from Fig. 4 (a) and (b),
where suppression is seen not to occur for t = 2 cycles, since the electronic wave packet
ﬁrst has to evolve into the highly distorted shape with distinct minima, as displayed in
Fig. 1 (b).

and E0 = 40 a.u.

For comparison, we have plotted the density proﬁles for the initial 1s state at
E0 = 30 a.u.
In contrast to the
in Fig.
case of the 2s state, for both peak ﬁeld strengths the distinct nodal structure of the
wave function near the nucleus is absent at the beginning of the turn-oﬀ of the laser
pulse, such that the photoionization cross section is not reduced during the turn-oﬀ of
the pulse. Consequently, the overall ionization probabilities do not exhibit a further
decrease in addition to that caused by the stabilization eﬀect. Furthermore, we have
performed calculations employing the initial 3s state, which has an ionization potential

Finally, we stress the role of the retardation of the laser pulse by comparing
the calculated ionization probabilities with results obtained within the dipole
approximation. The latter have been computed by explicitly neglecting the spatial
dependence of the vector potential, and therefore also that of the electric ﬁeld. At the
high laser intensities and frequencies employed throughout our calculations, non-dipole

eﬀects are expected to have a non-negligible impact on the atomic ionization dynamics,
and may also suppress the stabilization eﬀect [13]. Comparison of results with and
without dipole approximation for the case of a pulse of nine cycles duration shows that
indeed the stabilization eﬀect at E0
is more pronounced in the calculations
20 a.u.
within the dipole approximation. At ﬁeld strengths higher than E0 = 25 a.u., the non-
dipole results for the ionization probabilities start to exceed noticeably those calculated
within the dipole approximation. For the highest ﬁeld strength E0 = 54 a.u.
the
Lorentz force acting on the electron increases the ionization probability by about forty
per cent, whilst it aﬀects neither the general shape of the ionization probabilities nor
the ionization suppression eﬀect.

≈

In conclusion, we have employed a two-dimensional model incorporating non-dipole
eﬀects of the laser pulse to study the ionization and stabilization of excited atomic
states. It has been found that beyond the stabilization regime ionization suppression
may occur. The existence of this eﬀect has been shown to be caused by a strong coupling
of the initial, ﬁeld-free state to the ground state via the eigenstates of the laser-driven
system, which can also be understood in terms of the wave function evolution in time.
Furthermore, it has been found that both stabilization and this eﬀect are diminished
yet not completely destroyed by the Lorentz force acting on the electronic wave packet.

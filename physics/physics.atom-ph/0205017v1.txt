Double photoionization by a single photon is often discussed in terms of two contributing mech-
anisms, knock-out (two-step-one) and shake-oﬀ with the latter being a pure quantum eﬀect. It is
shown that a quasi-classical description of knock-out and a simple quantum calculation of shake-oﬀ
provides a clear separation of the mechanisms and facilitates their calculation considerably. The
relevance of each mechanism at diﬀerent photon energies is quantiﬁed for helium. Photoionization
ratios, integral and singly diﬀerential cross sections obtained by us are in excellent agreement with
benchmark experimental data and recent theoretical results.

Our understanding of dynamical processes often rests
on isolating approximate mechanisms which leave charac-
teristic traces in the measured or computed observables.
A prime example is double photoionization. After the
initial absorption of the photon by the primary electron
the subsequent redistribution of the energy among the
electrons is often discussed in terms of two mechanisms
[1], knock-out (KO) (sometimes called ‘two-step-one’ [2])
and shake-oﬀ (SO) [3, 4, 5]. The ﬁrst mechanism de-
scribes the correlated dynamics of the two electrons as
they leave the nucleus where the primary electron has
knocked out the secondary electron in an (e, 2e)-like pro-
cess. The second mechanism accounts for the fact that
absorption of the photon may lead to a sudden removal
of the primary electron. This causes a change in the
atomic ﬁeld so that the secondary electron relaxes with a
certain probability to an unbound state of the remaining
He+ ion, i.e., the secondary electron is shaken oﬀ.

Apart from general properties, e.g., the prevalence of
shake-oﬀ at high photon energies, it is diﬃcult to separate
the processes. However, they are distinct with respect
to their quantum nature: shake-oﬀ is a purely quantum
mechanical phenomenon while knock-out dynamics oc-
curs classically as well as quantum mechanically. This
opens up the possibility to separate shake-oﬀ and knock-
out by calculating the latter (quasi-)classically, provided
the quasi-classical approximation to knock-out is good.
Clearly, the quasi-classical KO mechanism does not con-
tain any part of SO (which is purely quantum).

The two phases of double photoionization, initial ab-
sorption and redistribution of the energy, can be ex-
pressed by the relation

of the ground state and use the experimental data of
Samson et al. [6] for σabs. We obtain the classical dou-
ble escape probability for KO with a classical-trajectory
Monte-Carlo (CTMC) phase space method. CTMC has
been frequently used for particle impact induced frag-
mentation [7, 8, 9, 10] with implementations diﬀering
typically in the way the phase space distribution, ρ(Γ),
of the initial state is constructed. Details of our approach
will be published elsewhere, here we summarize the im-
portant steps only.

Within our phase space approach the double escape

probability P ++

KO is formally given by

P ++

KO = lim

t→∞ Z

dΓP ++ exp((t − tabs)Lcl)ρ(Γ),

(2)

with the classical Liouvillian Lcl for the full three-body
Coulomb system propagated from the time tabs of pho-
toabsorption. The projector P ++ indicates that we have
to integrate only over those parts of phase space that
lead to double escape (the asymptotic ﬁnal energies of
the two electrons, ε and E − ε, are positive). The inte-
gral in Eq. (2) is evaluated with a standard Monte-Carlo
technique which entails following classical trajectories in
phase space.

The electrons are described immediately after absorp-

tion by the distribution

ρ(Γ) = N δ(~r1)ρ2(~r2, ~p2)

(3)

where N is a normalization constant. The primary elec-
tron absorbs the photon which has an energy ~ω. With
δ(~r1) we demand the absorption to occur at the nucleus,
an approximation which becomes exact in the limit of
high photon energy [11]. This approximation signiﬁ-
cantly reduces the initial phase space volume to be sam-
pled. Regularized coordinates [12, 13] are used to avoid
problems with electron trajectories starting at the nu-
cleus (~r1 = 0).

The function ρ2(~r2, ~p2) describing the secondary elec-

tron in Eq. (3) is given by

ρ2(~r2, ~p2) = Wψ(~r2, ~p2)δ(εin

2 − εB).

It is obtained by calculating the Wigner distribution,
Wψ(~r2, ~p2), of the orbital ψ(~r2) = Ψ0(~r1 = 0, ~r2) for a
choice of initial wavefunction Ψ0, and restricting the ini-
tial energy of the secondary electron, εin
2 , to an energy
shell εB. In the KO mechanism the initial state correla-
tion is not important so we take the independent particle
wavefunction Ψ0(~r1, ~r2) = (Z 3

with eﬀective charge Zeﬀ = Z − 5/16. From this choice

KO ).

(5)

In Fig. 1 we show RKO as a function of the excess en-
ergy E (dashed line). The shape is characteristic of an
impact ionization process [14]. For high energies the pri-
mary electron moves away so quickly that there is no time
to transfer energy to the secondary electron, RKO thus
drops to zero as expected. The non-zero asymptotic ratio
(indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1) is due to SO which we
describe next.

In contrast to KO the shake mechanism is inherently
non-classical in nature. Moreover, initial state correla-
tions are important for shake-oﬀ. As a generalization of
the standard formula for SO [4], ˚Aberg gave an expres-
sion for the probability to ﬁnd the shake electron in state
φα at any excess energy [5],

hydrogenic eigenstate of the bare nucleus, being either
bound (α = n2), or in the continuum (α = ε). As for KO
we assume that the primary electron absorbs the photon
at the nucleus. In this situation we do not need to know
ν(~r1) but can simply replace ψν (~r2) by Ψ0(~r1 = 0, ~r2)
in Eq. (7). We may further simplify the calculation of
shake-oﬀ for practical applications in two-electron atoms
by taking for Ψ0(~r1 = 0, ~r2) a normalized hydrogenic
wavefunction φZSO
1s (~r2) where the correlations have been
‘absorbed’ into an eﬀective shake charge ZSO [15]. For
ZSO ≈ 2 − 0.51 the exact asymptotic ratio R∞ = 0.01645
[16, 17] is reproduced. We have found little diﬀerence for
the shake probability as a function of excess energy be-
tween this simple ansatz and a fully correlated Hylleraas
wavefunction [18] for Ψ0.

The shake-oﬀ probability of Eq. (6) reduces now to

The photoionization ratio when only the SO mecha-
nism is taken into account (same as Eq. (5) but for SO)
is shown in Fig. 1 (chained line). The ratio rises slower
than the KO mechanism result up to an energy of around
100 eV where the KO ratio reaches its maximum value.
The SO ratio continues to rise until at a couple of hun-
dred eV it moves more slowly up toward the asymptotic
value. An interesting feature of the plot is where the KO
and SO results cross at an excess energy of ∼ 350 eV.

To obtain more insight into the two mechanisms we
calculate the diﬀerential probabilities dP ++
X /dε, where
X stands for either SO or KO. In our classical model of
the KO mechanism we divide the interval of values for ε
which corresponds to double escape (0 ≤ ε ≤ E) into N
equally sized bins (we take N = 21) and work out the
diﬀerential probability by ﬁnding the trajectories which
fall into the bins. For the SO mechanism the probability
per energy unit, Pε in Eq. (9), already gives the diﬀeren-
tial probability. Since the electrons are indistinguishable
the diﬀerential probabilities must be symmetrized about
the equal energy sharing point (ε = E − ε = E/2),

In the case of low excess energy (6 eV) we ﬁnd a slightly
concave shape for the KO distribution, see Fig. 2. This
implies a preference for equal energy sharing, the typical
behavior close to threshold [19]. The SO result in con-
trast displays a slightly convex shape which becomes ﬂat
as E → +0. Unequal energy sharing is always preferred
by SO since the photoelectron is fast with respect to the
secondary electron. For all higher excess energies shown
both mechanisms display a convex form.

SO may be viewed as an additional quantum contribu-
tion to the quasi-classically calculated double photoion-
ization given by KO. This means that the full result is

[22] at the same excess
energies apart from (a) which is at 5 eV. The triangles in

σ++(41 eV) of Samson [20].

The single ionization cross section is σ+ = σabs − σ++
and the double-to-single ratio is given by R = σ++/σ+ =
P ++/(1 − P ++), where P ++ = P ++

KO + P ++
SO .

In Fig. 1 we compare the ratio R (solid line) to the
experimental data of Samson et al.
[20]. For excess
energies up to 200 eV we ﬁnd an excellent agreement.
In the energy regime where the two contributions are of
the same size there is a deviation between experiment
and our result (at worst 8%). Exactly in this situation
any interference which exists between SO and KO would
show its largest eﬀect. The deviation we ﬁnd may be
due to such an interference which we cannot account for
since we determine KO quasi-classically. At higher ener-
gies the diﬀerence decreases again (already visible in the
plot) until at very high energies our result reproduces the
asymptotic ratio.

Knowing that the diﬀerential probabilities for KO and
SO enter the full ionization probability with the same
weight we can assess the relative importance of both con-
tributions at diﬀerent energies. From Fig. 2 one sees that
at 110 eV SO has become more important than KO for
highly unequal energy sharings. As energy is increased
to 450 eV SO begins to dominate regions of unequal en-
ergy sharing. On the other hand, KO is higher at equal
energy sharing for all excess energies E.

Fig. 3 shows that our singly diﬀerential cross sections
(SDCS) agree well with the recent ab initio theoretical
results of Colgan et al.
[21]. We note that the results
of Proulx and Shakeshaft [23] show a concave shape for

our results which are convex down to 6 eV. In Fig. 4 we
compare our absolute SDCS to the experimental data of
Wehlitz et al. [22] which has been recalibrated using the
values of the photoabsorption cross section of Samson et
al. [6]. In their original work Wehlitz et al. normalized
their SDCS using a photoabsorption cross section [24]
which is now known to overestimate the 5-41 eV range
by 9 to 16%. In addition, the photoionization ratio they
measured at 41 eV is ∼ 17% higher than the Samson et

into account.

Our approach not only facilitates the calculation of
double photoionization, it also oﬀers considerable insight
into the physical process, e.g., concerning the similarity
with electron impact ionization of He+ [25]. Indeed, we
can show that impact ionization may be viewed as the
KO part of double photoionization (Fig. 5). The only dif-
ference is that impact ionization sees a He+ hydrogenic
target electron with binding energy EB = −Z 2/2, Z = 2,
while the KO process involves a bound electron with en-
ergy E′
eﬀ/2. One may thus say that both pro-
cesses diﬀer only slightly, namely in the energy scale set
by the respective bound electron.

B = −Z 2

We conclude that the separate formulation and cal-
culation of knock-out and shake-oﬀ oﬀers an accurate
description of double photoionization. In principle this
approach can be extended to describe angular diﬀeren-
tial cross sections. We have used a description in terms
of the simplest wavefunctions possible having in mind to
tackle three electron problems in a similar way.

(Dated: February 21, 2014)
We report photoassociative spectroscopy of 88Sr2 in a magneto-optical trap operating on the
1S0 → 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm. Photoassociative transitions are driven with a laser
red-detuned by 600-2400 MHz from the 1S0 → 1P1 atomic resonance at 461 nm. Photoassociation
takes place at extremely large internuclear separation, and the photoassociative spectrum is strongly
aﬀected by relativistic retardation. A ﬁt of the transition frequencies determines the 1P1 atomic
lifetime (τ = 5.22 ± 0.03 ns) and resolves a discrepancy between experiment and recent theoretical
calculations.

Photoassociative spectroscopy (PAS) in laser-cooled
gases [1] is a powerful probe of molecular potentials and
atomic cold collisions.
It provides accurate determina-
tion of ground state scattering lengths and excited state
lifetimes [2]. Photoassociation occurs naturally in laser
cooling and trapping experiments in which the lasers are
red-detuned from atomic resonance, so characterizing the
process is also important for understanding and optimiz-
ing the production of ultracold atoms (e.g. [3]).

PAS of alkaline earth atoms diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
more common studies of alkali metal atoms. The most
abundant isotopes of alkaline earth atoms lack hyper-
ﬁne structure, making these systems ideal for testing
PAS theory. Recent theoretical work [4] emphasized
the ability to resolve transitions at extremely large in-
ternuclear separation and very small detuning from the
atomic asymptote. The ﬁnite speed of light modiﬁes the
potential in this regime through relativistic retardation
[5, 6, 7].

There is also great interest in alkaline-earth-atom cold
collisions because of their importance for optical fre-
quency standards [8, 9, 10, 11] and for the creation of
quantum degenerate gases [12, 13, 14]. In addition, col-
lisions involving metastable states [15, 16, 17, 18] dis-
play novel properties that arise from electric quadrupole-
quadrupole or magnetic dipole-dipole interactions.

PAS red-detuned from the principle transitions in cal-
cium [19] and ytterbium [20] is well characterized, re-
sulting in accurate measurements of the ﬁrst excited 1P1
lifetimes and the ground state s-wave scattering lengths.
In spite of its importance for potential optical frequency
standards, little is known about strontium. The photoas-
1P1
sociative loss rate induced by trap lasers in a 1S0 →
magneto-optical trap (MOT) has been measured [3], and
preliminary results from more extensive spectroscopy
were recently reported [21]. Ab initio strontium poten-
tials have been calculated for small internuclear separa-
tion (R < 9 nm) [22].

Internuclear separation

FIG. 1: Molecular levels and photoassociative transitions.
Resonant excitation occurs near the outer molecular turning
point of states of the 1Σu potential, and it can lead to trap loss
through two processes. The molecule can radiatively decay
at smaller internuclear separation to two ground state atoms
with kinetic energies exceeding the trap depth. This is known
as radiative escape (RE). In a state-changing collision (SC),
at small internuclear separation the molecular state changes
to one corresponding at long range to a lower-lying electronic
conﬁguration of free atoms. The atoms exit the collision with
greatly increased kinetic energy and escape the trap.

ple spectrum allows us to resolve transitions as little as
600 MHz detuned from the atomic resonance, which pro-
duces molecules with greater internuclear separation than
in any previous PAS work. Our determination of the
ﬁrst excited 1P1 lifetime resolves a discrepancy between
experiment and recent theoretical work, and provides an
importance test of atomic structure theory for alkaline
earth atoms.

The most common form of PAS involves resonantly
inducing trap loss in a MOT, although early work was
also conducted in optical-dipole traps [1, 2]. Recent ex-
periments have also studied spectroscopy of atoms in
magnetic traps, especially in Bose-Einstein condensates
[23, 24]. The experiments described in this article were

performed in a MOT, but the MOT operated on the
3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm [25], rather
1S0 →
than an electric-dipole allowed transition. This results
in lower atom temperature, a shallower trap, and higher
atom density than a standard MOT.

Atoms are initially trapped in a MOT operating on the
1P1 transition, as described in [26]. Dur-
461 nm 1S0 →
ing the loading phase, the peak intensity in each MOT
beam is 6 mW/cm2, and the axial magnetic ﬁeld gradient
generated by a pair of anti-Helmholtz coils is 56 G/cm.
The intensity is then reduced by about a factor of 8 for
3.5 ms to reduce the atom temperature. After this stage
the MOT contains about 150 million atoms at 2 mK.

The 461 nm laser cooling light is then extinguished,
the ﬁeld gradient is reduced to 2.1 G/cm, and the 689
3P1 intercombination-line MOT
nm light for the 1S0 →
is switched on. This MOT also consists of three retro-
reﬂected beams, each with a diameter of 2 cm and inten-
sity of 400 µW/cm2. The frequency of the 689 nm laser is
detuned from the atomic resonance by 0.5 MHz and spec-
trally broadened with a
400 kHz sine-wave modulation.
Transfer and equilibration take about 50 ms, after which
there are 15 million atoms at a temperature of 5 µK, peak
3, and 1/√e density radius
density of about 5
of about 100 µm.

The intercombination-line MOT operates for an ad-
justable hold time before measuring the remaining num-
ber of atoms with absorption imaging using the 1S0 →
1P1 transition. The lifetime of atoms in the MOT is ap-
proximately 350 ms, limited by background gas collisions.
To detect photoassociative resonances, a PAS laser is ap-
400 ms.
plied to the atoms during hold times of 300
When the PAS laser is tuned to a molecular resonance,
photoassociation provides another loss mechanism for the
MOT, decreasing the number of atoms.

−

Light for photoassociation is derived from the same
laser that produces the 461 nm light for laser cooling.
Several acousto-optic modulators (AOM), detune the
light 600 to 2400 MHz to the red of the atomic transition.
The laser frequency is locked relative to a Doppler-free
saturated-absorption feature in a vapor cell, with an un-
certainty of about 2 MHz. The last AOM in the oﬀset
chain, in a double-pass conﬁguration, controls the power
of the PAS laser and scans the frequency up to 200 MHz
with minimal beam misalignment. PAS light is double-
passed through the MOT in a standing wave, with a 1/e2
intensity radius of w = 3 mm.

Figure 2A shows the number of atoms remaining af-
ter the hold time as a function of PAS laser detuning
near a typical resonance. We record spectra with PAS
5 mW/cm2, much less than the
laser intensity from 0.5
atomic saturation intensity (Isat = 40 mW/cm2). For
the lower intensities, the linewidth is close to the ex-
pected natural linewidth of twice the inverse of the 1P1
atomic lifetime (τ −

FIG. 2: A. Spectrum for photoassociation to the v = 60
molecular state. Detuning is with respect to the atomic
1S0 − 1P1 resonance. The PAS laser intensity is 1.4 mW/cm2.
The Lorentzian ﬁt yields a FWHM linewidth of 70 ± 7 MHz.
B. Representative spectra for all transitions observed in this
study. Lines connect the data points to guide the eye. Con-
ditions vary for the individual scans that make up the full
spectrum, so amplitudes and linewidths should not be quan-
titatively compared. The baseline has been adjusted to match
a theoretically calculated curve. C. Diﬀerences between ex-
perimental and calculated positions of the 14 measured levels.

lisions occur, so only a single rotational level (J = 1) is
excited. For higher intensity, the observed line is broad-
ened slightly because, on resonance, a large fraction of
atoms is converted to molecules.

Figure 2B shows a complete spectrum of the 14 diﬀer-
ent PAS resonances observed in this study. Center fre-
quencies for each transition are determined by Lorentzian
ﬁts. The typical statistical uncertainty is 2-3 MHz, but
there is approximately 2 MHz additional uncertainty aris-
ing from the lock of the laser. The Condon radius for
the excitation varies from 20 nm for the largest detuning
to 32 nm for the smallest. These extremely large values
exceed the inter-nuclear spacing of molecules formed in
photoassociative spectroscopy to pure long-range poten-
tials [6, 27].

tions, and is typically approximated by

where D is the dissociation energy and λ = 461 nm.
However, at very large separations, the atom-atom in-
teraction is modiﬁed by relativistic corrections. This
retardation eﬀect is well understood [5] and can be in-
cluded in the analysis of the spectrum through C3 →
C3[cos(u) + u sin(u)], where u = 2πR/λ. Machholm et

[4] discussed this in the context of PAS of alkaline

al.
earth atoms.

To extract molecular parameters from the positions of
the PAS resonances, we constructed a potential curve by
smoothly connecting the long range form (Eq. (1)) to a
short range curve at a distance of 1.5 nm. The short range
ab initio potential was obtained using a semi-empirical
two-valence-electron pseudopotential method [22]. To ac-
count for uncertainty in the short range potential, the
position of the repulsive wall was varied as a ﬁt param-
eter. The rovibrational levels in the 1Σ+
u potential were
found by solving the radial Schr¨odinger equation using
the Mapped Fourier Grid Method [28] with a grid size
typically larger than 500 nm containing about 1000 grid
points.

±

We found that the observed levels range from 48 to
61, starting the numbering from the dissociation limit.
The best ﬁt of the data was achieved with a value of
C3 = 18.54 a.u., with a reduced chi-squared value of
χ2 = 0.79. (See Fig. 2C). χ2 varied by less than 10%
for a change of level assignments of ∆v =
1, so we
consider our assignment to be uncertain by this amount.
The value of C3 changed by
0.5% as the assignments
changed, which is much larger than the statistical uncer-
tainty for a given assignment. We thus take
0.5% as
our uncertainty in C3. A ﬁt to the level spacings, as op-
posed to the absolute positions, yielded the same value
of C3. From C3, we derive a natural decay rate of the
atomic 5p 1P1 state of τ = 5.22
0.03 ns. Decay channels
1S0 can be neglected at this level of
other than 1P1 →
accuracy. The most recent experimental determinations
of τ use the Hanle eﬀect [29, 30]. Our result agrees well
with recent theoretical values [31, 32, 33] (Fig. 3).

±

±

±

Retardation eﬀects shift the levels by approximately
100 MHz in this regime, which is similar to the shift seen
in a pure long range potential in Na2 [6]. If retardation
eﬀects are neglected and the data is ﬁt using the simple
LeRoy semiclassical treatment [34], the level assignments
change signiﬁcantly, and C3 changes by more than 10%,
putting it outside the range of recent theoretical results.
Center frequency shifts due to coupling to the continuum
of the ground state have been ignored as they are less
than 50 kHz for typical experimental temperatures.

FIG. 4: A. Number of atoms as a function of time for atoms in
the intercombination-line MOT. The PAS laser is tuned near
the v = 59 molecular resonance. In one data set the PAS laser
is on resonance, and in the other it is tuned to the blue of res-
onance by 42 MHz, and loss due to photoassociation is small.

and trap loss.

Even with photoassociation, the deviation of N (t) from
a single exponential decay is small, making it diﬃcult to
independently extract β and Γ with high accuracy from
a single decay curve. To address this problem, we take
advantage of the fact that when the PAS laser is not
on a molecular resonance, the photoassociation rate is
small (See Fig. 2B), and within the accuracy of our mea-
surement it can be neglected. All other processes, how-
ever, such as oﬀ-resonance scattering from the atomic
transition, are the same. We thus take data in pairs
of on and oﬀ-resonance, and ﬁt oﬀ-resonance data to
Γt. The on-resonance data is then ﬁt with
N (t) = N0e−
Eq. (2) with Γ ﬁxed to the value determined from the
oﬀ-resonance data. The resulting two body decay rates
are shown in Fig. 4B. For the relatively small intensities
used, β is expected to vary linearly with laser power [35].
We currently image along the direction of grav-
ity and lack the additional diagnostic required to ob-
tain information on the third dimension of the atom
cloud. Gravity can distort the equilibrium shape of the
intercombination-line MOT because the light force is so
weak [36]. However, we operate the MOT in the regime
where the laser detuning is comparable to the modula-

tion of the laser spectrum, and this eﬀect is small. Based
on the range of distortions we observe in the imaged di-
mensions for various misalignments of the MOT beams,
we allow for a scale uncertainty of a factor of two in the
volume of the MOT. This contributes an identical uncer-
tainty in the measurements of β.

The measured values of β

Measurements of MOT size suggest that as the PAS
laser power increases, the cloud radius increases slightly
(20% for the highest intensities), decreasing the atomic
density. This is expected because oﬀ-resonance scattering
from the atomic transition should heat the sample. The
data quality does not allow a reliable correction for this
eﬀect, however, and we use the average of all observed
σ as a constant σ in Eq. 2. This contributes another
approximately 50% uncertainty in our determination of
β. Overall, we quote a factor of 3 uncertainty due to
systematic eﬀects, which dominates over statistical error.
11 cm3/sec for
1 mW/cm2 in the intercombination-line MOT are about
one order of magnitude larger than reported theoreti-
cal [4] and experimental [3] values of β for atoms in
a MOT operating on the 461 nm transition. This is
not surprising. A MOT based on an electric-dipole al-
lowed transition would typically have a trap depth of
1 K. In our experiment, the transfer eﬃciency of atoms
∼
from the 461 nm MOT places a lower limit of
0.5 mK
on the depth of the intercombination-line MOT. Us-
ing the formalism of [36] and the parameters of the
intercombination-line MOT, we calculate a trap depth
of 2 mK. As described in Fig. 1, photoassociative loss re-
quires excitation to a molecular state followed by decay
to a conﬁguration of two atoms with enough kinetic en-
ergy to escape from the trap [4]. State changing collisions
in the strontium system always release enough energy
to escape from a MOT. The radiative escape rate, how-
ever, is more sensitive to trap parameters because the
molecule decays at a range of internuclear separations
near the outer turning point, and the kinetic energy re-
leased is not always large enough to lead to trap loss. In
the intercombination-line MOT, a greater fraction of ra-
diative decay events should lead to escape from the trap,
increasing β.

∼

Photoassociative spectroscopy has elucidated dynam-
ics of collisions in an intercombination-line MOT and
provided an accurate measurement of the lifetime of the
lowest 1P1 state of strontium. This has resolved a previ-
ous discrpenancy between experimental and theoretical
values of the lifetime. We have also taken advantage of
the simple structure of the spectrum to measure tran-
sitions at very large internuclear separation where the
level spacing and natural linewidth are comparable and
retardation eﬀects are large.

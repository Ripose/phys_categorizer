Abstract

Eﬀect of charge-transfer recombination for positronium (Ps) scattering is studied

on Ps-H system using coupled-channel formalism considering a new rearrangement

channel Ps+H

e++H− and exchange. The correlation and continuum eﬀects in-

→

troduced by this charge-transfer channel result to substantial convergence to the low

energy scattering parameters. Eﬀects on scattering length, PsH binding energy, and

low-energy (0-10 eV) cross sections are evaluated and H− formation cross sections

are reported from above the threshold (6.438 eV) to 100 eV.

Introduction : Charge-transfer recombinations have been found to be of fundamental

importance in simulating the continuum eﬀect in the scattering dynamics of positrons

[1, 2]. Their roles are yet to be investigated for the scattering of positronium (Ps) atom -

an exotic bound state of electron and positron with singlet and triplet spins. This seems

to be very important since, despite a long history of theoretical studies [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], we are yet to produce

converged scattering results in the ab initio coupled-channel (CC) framework, even for

the simplest Ps-H system [10].

So far, in dealing with Ps scattering, emphasis has been given to the exchange rear-

rangement of electrons, which is also of fundamental importance, as the static-potential

for a Ps-target system vanishes due to internal charge-and-mass symmetry of Ps. However,

exchange constitutes only a part of the continuum and Ps exhibits a strong polarizability

of 36a3

0, which is expected to make it vulnerable to continuum eﬀects and charge transfer

processes. Continuum eﬀect can be simulated through pseudostates of Ps and target,

but for Ps scattering this is expected lead to an untractable situation as the number of

scattering channels grows like N 2, where N-number of intermediate states for each of Ps

and target are considered. Considering the diﬃculty, so far, the pseudostate technique

has been applied (to Ps-H and Ps-He scattering problem) employing pseudostates for only

Ps. This is not expected to simulate the appropriate continuum eﬀect as the target is

kept idle to keep the calculational schemes tractable. However, from the experience in

positron-atom scattering [2], we understand that allowed charge transfer processes can

also enhance the continuum eﬀect signiﬁcantly and lead to the required convergence of

the theoretical scheme. The eﬀect of such charge-transfer channels is yet unexplored for

Ps scattering and is the subject of this work.

Apart from the initial works [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the recent theoretical development on

Ps scattering studies, has contributions from the Belfast group [9, 10, 11], the Calcutta

2

group [12, 13, 14] and the S˜ao Paulo group [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. While

the Belfast and Calcutta groups use complete ab initio coupled-channel (CC) formalism,

the S˜ao Paulo group indulges to model exchange correlation potentials (to enhance the

correlation and continuum eﬀects) in the ab initio CC formalism. In this investigation, we

concentrate on the simplest but the richest Ps-H scattering problem, where predictions

of the ab initio coupled-channel (CC) calculations are yet to converge with those of the

accrrate variational calculations [30, 28].

In the ab initio CC formalism, the largest continuum eﬀect has been taken in a 22-

state calculation which uses three eigen states and nineteen pseudostates of Ps keeping

the target idle. This calculation yields PsH binding energy of 0.634 eV and S-wave singlet

resonance energy of 4.55 eV compared to the most accurate variational estimates of 1.067

eV [30] and 4.003 eV [28], respectively. The lack of convergence was expected as the virtual

eﬀects of the target are neglected. Interestingly, predictions of this CC calculation come

to close agreement with the predictions of another variational calculation [5] that has been

performed without explicit electron-electron correlation in their trial ansatz. The precise

variational calculations above [30, 28] includes explicit e

e correlation in their trial wave

−

functions and they also contain H− ﬂavour. These clearly emphasize the necessity of the

introduction of more electron-electron correlation and continuum eﬀects to the present

state of the art CC calculations. We understand that, for Ps-H system, electron-electron

correlation and continuum eﬀects could be enhanced through the formation of H−-ion via

Ps+H

e++H− channel in the CC model.

→

Before ﬁnishing the introduction, we note another relevant developement in this sub-

ject. For the last few years we have been engaged in addressing the Ps scattering problems

by using a model exchange correlation potential in the ab initio CC formalism. Apart

from the recent theoretical development on Ps scattering by the Belfast and Calcutta

groups employing complete ab initio formalism, studies has contributions from two more

3

groups other than the Belfast group which has considered the Ps-pseudostate technique

[9, 10, 11], mentioned above. The Calcutta group has addressed the Ps-H problem in var-

ious ways [12, 13, 14], but they have not reported the binding or resonance parameters.

So, these aspects and hence the overall convergence of their low energy scattering results

could not be assesed comparing with the accurate variational predictions.

In the last few years, we are addressing Ps scattering problems by using a model reg-

ularized exchange-correlation potential (non-local) [21] in the exact coupled Lippmann-

Schwinger equation [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

In these calculations, con-

vergence and agreement with accurate variational predictions are achieved by employing

a minimum number of eﬀective scattering channels and tuning the exchange correlation

potentials by means of a parameter. The model agreed well with the measured data

[31, 32, 33, 34] in Ps-He []. When applied to Ps-H, it reproduces the precise binding and

resonances energies. Thereafter, it has laso been applied to other taegets (H2, Ne, Ar,

Li) and agreement with measured data is obtained. However, the crucial aspect of the

model remains the tuning of the parameter.

It appears that the exchange correlation

potentials, when tuned, compensate for the correlation and continuum eﬀects (see details

in the results and discussions). Thus, we expect that the direct inclusion of correlation

and continuum eﬀects in the model CC framework, through the H− formation channel,

would diminish the role of the parameter. Also, the charge transfer channel, in general,

is expected to improve the results obtained in the ab-initio framework due to possible

enhancement of correlation and continuum eﬀects.

To have a preliminary assessment of these assertions, we re-investigate the Ps-H scat-

tering including the process Ps+H

e++H−. In the present work, for a ﬁrst estimation,

→

we use a simple wave function of Chandrasekhar for the H− ion [35]. Any elaborate wave

function containing the r12 term would certainly enhance the electron-electron correlation

further. We estimate the eﬀect of this charge-transfer recombination channel in the ab

4

initio CC framework by taking exchange exactly and also by using the regularized model

exchange [21] in the CC equations.

Theory: Antisymmetrizing for the constituent electrons, we expand the total wave

function of the Ps-H system in terms of Ps (χν), H (φµ), and H− (ψρ) states as

Chandrasekhar [35]. Understanding the diﬃculty in dealing with a coulomb wave for

the outgoing positron, we treat it with a plane wave in the input Born matrix element

for channel-2, as the distortion to this plane wave will partly be done through the use

of dynamical Lippmann-Schwinger equation (given in the next paragraph) and coupling

over intermediate states.

[18]. We use ¯h = c = m2 = 1, where m2 is the mass of electron or positron and m1 = 2,

the mass of Ps.

Recently, a concern has been raised by Adhikari and Mandal (AM) [38] regarding the

validity of the calculation of the BO exchange term of Sinha et al [13] and provided a

diﬀerent results for this BO exchange term. We were also concern with AM regarding

the feature of a minimum in the elastic cross section with BO exchange near 35 eV.

However, present results for Be

1s1s,1s1s exchange agree exactly with those of Sinha et al

[13] and when this BO amplitude is used in the coupled equations, along with the required

oﬀ-shell matrix element, it reproduces the static-exchange phase shifts of Campbell et al

[10], Sinha et al [13], and Hara and Fraser [4] quite precisely (discussed in the results

7

(9)

(10)

(11)

and discussion). So, it implies that the BO exchange amplitudes in these calculations are

same and the minimum in the cross section is a feature of the BO exchange term and not

due to any error in its evaluation. AM evaluates the BO exchange term relying mostly

on numerical calculations where the integrand contains spherical Bessel functions and

they have reported to use 400 Gauss-quadrature points in the evaluation of the integrals.

Whereas, using Fourier transform and Chasire integrals, we reduce the nine-dimensional

integrals (Appendix I) to simple two-dimensional integrals which is found to converge with

mere eight Gauss-quadrature points for each integration variable and hence any numerical

problem is ruled out in this methodology compared to that provided by AM [38].

In Appendix I, we provide the analytical form of the ab initio BO exchange matrix

element Be

1s1s,1s1s and the charge-transfer matrix element Bd

1s2,1s1s is detailed in Appendix

II. In a separate study, we employ the regularized model exchange for Be

1s1s,1s1s, which is

taken from ref.[18] (it diﬀers only in sign convention from ref.[21]).

Numerical Procedures : In the present investigation, we consider static-exchange

(SE) and SE plus charge-transfer reactions of Ps-H to e+-H−. The three-dimensional

LS equations, for a particular electronic-spin state (S) are decomposed to coupled one-

dimensional partial wave equations, which are then solved by the method of matrix in-

version. We ﬁnd that at low energies, 44-48 Gauss quadrature points (24 points for

k′′1 = 0

−

2kν′′µ′′ interval and 20-24 points for k′′ = 2kν′′µ′′

interval and similarly for

− ∞

k′′2 are needed for the discretization of the Kernel of the LS equation, to achieve numerical

convergence up to 4-decimal places.

Results and Discussions : We begin the discussions of our results with the singlet

channel cross sections. The eﬀect of the Ps+H

e++H− channel would be revealed in

this singlet channel, as H− belongs to a spin singlet state only. Also, the binding and

resonance of PsH occur in this channel. In ﬁgure-1, we plot the S-wave singlet cross section

from 0-10 eV to exhibit the inﬂuence of this channel (channel-2) over the static-exchange

→

8

prediction (using both exact and model exchange). In both the cases, we ﬁnd that this

channel reduces the singlet scattering cross section signiﬁcantly, at low energies. This

implies that this channel eﬀectively makes the attractive potential more strong and we

can expect a smaller scattering length and a greater binding energy. Using an eﬀective-

range expansion of the form kcotδ =

1/a + r0k2/2 + Dk4, and ﬁnding solution of the

−

equation kcotδ

ik = 0 for the bound state, where k is the momentum of Ps, δ is the

−

S-wave singlet phase shift, r0 is the corresponding eﬀective range, and D is the coeﬃcient

for the k4 term, we obtain the binding energy and scattering length which are tabulated

in table 1.

As expected, we ﬁnd the scattering length (S.L.) is reduced and the binding energy

(B.E.) is increased with the inﬂuence of the H− formation channel. The eﬀect is much

pronounced in the case of model exchange calculation, thus signifying a lesser role for

the parameter in the model potential. The scattering length prediction in the 2CH(ME)

is quite close to the 22-state prediction. Keeping in mind the simple form of H− wave

function used in this calculation, and the proven role of the direct r12 term in the vari-

ational prediction [28], we get the impression that the impact of this channel in the ab

9

initio model could be improved signiﬁcantly by using a more shopisticated wave function

for H− which contains the r12 term. The small diﬀerence in the scattering length (S.L.)

and binding energy (B.E.) of SE calculations of set (a) and set (b) is due to the fact that

in (b) we have used an eﬀective range expansion to extrapolate the phase shifts to the

negative energy region while in set (a) those parameters are directly solved. The positive

energy scattering phase shifts for (a) and (b) agree exactly. We tabulate the phase shifts

for diﬀerent models in table 2 for future reference.

First we discuss about SE phase shifts where recently a dispute has been raised [38]. Table

2 shows that the present phase shifts for the SE calculation for the singlet and triplet scattering

agree exactly with the existing SE predictions of Hara and Fraser [4] and Sinha et al [13].

Campbell et al [10] provided SE phase shifts for other k

values (Ps energy, E = 6.8k2). At

−

10

k2 = 0.1639, 0.2478, and 0.5588 (a.u) the singlet phase shifts of Campbell et al are given by

(table 1 of ref. [10]) 1.23, 1.00, 0.56, respectively and our predicted values are 1.228, 1.002, and

0.5614, respectively (all cross sections are in units of πa2

0). So all these SE predictions, which use

BO exchange amplitude as the input, agree among themselves. This suggests that the minimum

in the BO cross section is a true feature of the model and the results of Adhikari and Mondal

(AM) [38] cannot agree with Campbell et al [10]. Since, at k2 = 0.5588, the BO cross sections

of AM [38] is about 23.5πa2

0, which is approximately 22% higher than the BO cross sections

(19.3πa2

0) of Sinha et al and present calculation. So, it is certain that any static exchange

prediction made using the BO exchange amplitude of AM as input to the CC equations, will

disagree with all existing SE results including those of Campbell et al [10]. While trying to get

an answer to the minimum in the elastic BO cross section, we ﬁnd that for forward scattering

the exchange potential changes its sign at about 26-27 eV, which is causing the minimum in the

cross section. We now come to the main business of the asssement of the inﬂuence of the H−

formation channel over the SE predictions.

In table 2, we compare the phase shifts of SE and 2CH calculations. For 2CH we do not

tabulate the triplet phase shifts since they do not change by the inﬂuence of channel-2 (as H−

exists only in singlet state). From table 2, we see that singlet phase shifts increase signiﬁcantly

with the inclusion of the H− formation channel. This signiﬁes an increase in the attractive

potential, which was expected and needed in the CC theory to improve the convergence and

hence improve the PsH binding energy. It is interesting to note that the eﬀect of this channel

continues signiﬁcantly around k = 1.0.

In ﬁgure 2, we plot the elastic cross sections for SE, SE(ME), 2CH, and 2CH(ME) models.

In this ﬁgure we also plot the recent variational prediction [39] on the zero energy cross section.

Elastic cross sections for both the ab initio and model calculations are reduced by the inﬂuence

of the charge transfer channel. At low energies, the 2CH(ME) model gives much lower cross

section than the 2CH model and the former is quite close to the recent variational prediction [39].

We have earlier ﬁnd that this model can lead to more converged results if the model exchange

11

potential is tuned by means of a parameter C [17, 21]. While trying to analyze the physics

behind such agreement with measurements and accurate variational predictions, we ﬁnd that

eﬀectively, while making approximate mapping of a basis set (ψµ(r2)) belonging to a diﬀerent

Fock-space to its original Fock-space (ψµ(r1)), basically we are indulging to approximations like:

where k2

when they were bound in the hydrogen (ψµ(r2)) or in the positronium atom (φν (x

r1)) and

−

C is a parameter which is ﬁxed to unity but could be varied to tune results. Clearly, the

above relations are introducing some amount of e1 −
of the target (eqn.()) and the projectile (eqn.()), respectively. Also, these eﬀects would be

e2 correlation and the continuum eﬀects

modiﬁed when the value of Ck2

µ or Ck2

ν are changed.

Interestingly, the model provides best

results [17, 22, 18] when Ck2

µ and Ck2

ν become close to the ionization energies for the respective

electrons. Although the mixing of such model exchange with ab initio charge-transfer process

yielded very good response, we are doubtful about the overcompleteness of the Hilbert space if

such mixing is continued with a larger basis for Ps. However, from the results of the 2CH model

and from our experience in such rearrangement for positron-atom scattering [], we understand

that for the full ab initio model (2CH) the possibility of overcompleteness is remote unless

a very large basis is used. The information we gain here in terms of the convergence of the

2CH prediction appears consistent and encouraging due to the fact that virtual excitations of

Ps are absent here. The charge-transfer reaction becomes exothermic for n

5 and higher

≥

discrete excited states and continuum of Ps and hence the eﬀect of such a channel is likely to

be signiﬁcant with higher Ps eigen states and pseudostates. Consideration of this channel along

with the Ps-excited states would also reveal its eﬀect on resonances, which manifest in the theory

with the inclusion of Ps excited states.

Another interesting feature of such study is that it provides the H− formation cross section

which is of importance in Astrophysics. Here we provide the H− formation cross sections from

Ps(1s)-H(1s) scattering in ﬁgure-2. Solid curve is obtained with the regularized exchange [21, 18]

while the dotted curve is obtained with ab initio exchange.

It is observed that from 60 eV

onwards the two sets of results are same signifying the fact that the regularized model exchange

asymptotically coalesce with the exact one. From the two curves we also see that, in the low

and intermediate energies, the cross sections calculated with the regularized exchange CC model

(2CH(ME)) are higher than those calculated with ab initio exchange (2CH). This was quite

expected as the regularized exchange potential, as discussued above, was found to simulate the

continuum eﬀect substantially and yield converged results for the PsH binding and resonances

[17, 22]. The contribution from virtual Ps excitations, no doubt will increase the H− formation

cross section and this trend has been revealed in the 2CH(ME) calculation.

Conclusion : In summary, we make a ﬁrst time study of the eﬀect of charge transfer recom-

bination for Ps scattering from hydrogen. Considering the rearrangement of PsH to e+H− we

get the information that such rearrangement can introduce the continuum eﬀect more eﬀectively

than considering only exchange. The attractive potential introduced by this channel improves

the scattering length and binding energy predictions signiﬁcantly. The inﬂuence of the channel

is also found to help converging the low energy cross sections (see ﬁgure 1). Similar eﬀect of

charge-transfer recombination was found in the cases of positron-atom scattering [1, 2] and in

the present case of Ps-atom scattering it could be more interesting as the threshold for the

transfer process Ps(1s)+H(1s)

e++H− decreases with higher Ps states and the reaction be-

comes exothermic for n

5 discrete excited states and continuum of Ps. So, it is expected that

→

≥

the channel would contribute substantially through virtual Ps excitations and lead to further

convergence for the low energy Ps scattering parameters. As a by product we get H− formation

cross sections which has astrophysical importance.

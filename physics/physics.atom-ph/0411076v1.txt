Resonant electric dipole-dipole interactions between cold Rydberg atoms were observed using
microwave spectroscopy. Laser-cooled 85Rb atoms in a magneto-optical trap were optically excited
to 45d5/2 Rydberg states using a pulsed laser. A microwave pulse transferred a fraction of these
Rydberg atoms to the 46p3/2 state. A second microwave pulse then drove atoms in the 45d5/2 state
to the 46d5/2 state, and was used as a probe of interatomic interactions. The spectral width of this
two-photon probe transition was found to depend on the presence of the 46p3/2 atoms, and is due
to the resonant electric dipole-dipole interaction between 45d5/2 and 46p3/2 Rydberg atoms.

The vast separation of the electron and ion-core in
high-n Rydberg atoms is responsible for their large tran-
sition dipole moments [1]. These dipole moments dic-
tate the strength of the dipole-dipole interaction be-
tween pairs of atoms. Therefore, excitation to Rydberg
states allows one to turn on strong interactions between
atoms which would otherwise be negligible. This has re-
cently received considerable attention in the context of
quantum information processing with cold neutral atoms
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. For example, it has been proposed that a
single excited Rydberg atom in a cloud may block further
resonant excitation due to the dipole-dipole interaction
– a process known as “dipole blockade” [3]. This would
allow clouds of cold atoms to store qubits without the ad-
dressing of individual atoms and may also be useful for
constructing single-atom and single-photon sources [5].

Non-resonant dipole-dipole (van der Waals) interac-
tions between Rydberg atoms were ﬁrst observed by Rai-
mond et al. [8] using spectral line broadening. Recently
it has been shown that Rydberg excitation densities in a
magneto-optical trap (MOT) are limited by these interac-
tions [9, 10]. Dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg
atoms have also been studied in the context of resonant
energy transfer [1]. Of particular relevance to this work
is the observation of resonant energy transfer between
cold Rydberg atoms [11, 12], where the Rydberg atoms
behave more like an amorphous solid than a gas, and one
cannot solely consider binary interactions to explain the
transfer process [13, 14]. However, use of the resonant
dipole-dipole interaction between cold Rydberg atoms to
inﬂuence radiative transitions – as presented in this work
– is an unexplored area.

We excite Rydberg states using a pulsed laser with
no stringent demands on linewidth or stability. Dipole-
dipole interactions are then introduced and probed using
microwave transitions between Rydberg states. This is
advantageous since commercial microwave synthesizers
are readily tunable, highly stable, and have easily ad-
justable powers and pulse-widths, as compared to lasers.
Using this approach we have made the ﬁrst spectroscopic
observation of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction be-

tween cold Rydberg atoms using radiative transitions.

To observe interactions between atoms that are eﬀec-
tively stationary, we excite Rydberg states of laser-cooled
atoms. A standard MOT is used as a source of cold 85Rb
atoms. The cooling and trapping light remains on during
the experiment and thus a fraction of atoms are in the ex-
cited 5p3/2 state. A Littman-Metcalf, Nd:YAG pumped,
nanosecond pulsed dye laser is used to excite these trans-
lationally cold 5p3/2 atoms to the 45d5/2 state. The to-
tal number of Rydberg atoms excited is sensitive to the
frequency spectrum of the multimode dye laser – which
varies from shot to shot. Since we are interested in den-
sity dependent eﬀects, data is recorded for every laser
shot and processed to select laser shots corresponding to
speciﬁed Rydberg atom densities [15]. The ﬂuctuations
may even be considered advantageous, as they allow a
range of Rydberg densities to be sampled automatically.
The MOT is formed between two metal plates 3.6 cm
apart. These plates contain small holes to let the cooling
and trapping lasers through. During laser excitation, an
electric ﬁeld of 5.1 V/cm is applied using these plates,
which removes ions formed during laser excitation. This
ﬁeld is switched oﬀ with a 0.2 µs fall time approximately
0.1 µs after photoexcitation, and remains less than 0.1
V/cm during application of the microwave pulses (this is
veriﬁed by observing the Stark shifts of the microwave
transitions [16]).

After optical excitation to the 45d5/2 state, a fraction
of the atoms may be transferred to either the 46p3/2 state
or the 45p3/2 state using a microwave pulse to drive a one-
photon transition (the “transfer pulse”) (see Fig. 1). The
microwave radiation is introduced into the experimental
region by horns placed outside the vacuum chamber, di-
rected towards the trapped atom cloud through a large
fused silica viewport. To obtain 50 % (± 10 %) transfer
of Rydberg atoms from the 45d5/2 to the 46p3/2 state in
0.6 µs long pulses requires less than 1 mW.

To observe dipole-dipole interactions from the line
broadening of spectroscopic transitions, it is desirable to
minimize other sources of broadening. In particular, the
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds necessary for operation

of the MOT may broaden spectroscopic transitions due
to the Zeeman eﬀect. However, as Li et al. [17] have
demonstrated, two-photon transitions between Rydberg
states with the same gJ factors (eg. nd5/2 − (n + 1)d5/2)
show negligible broadening in a MOT. Thus, we use the
45d5/2 − 46d5/2 two-photon transition as a high resolu-
tion, sensitive “probe” of interatomic interactions. This
6 µs probe pulse requires a total power of less than 100
µW and is introduced to the atoms in the same manner
as the transfer pulses. The probe frequency is typically
scanned between laser shots and the Rydberg state pop-
ulations are measured after each shot using the selective
ﬁeld ionization (SFI) technique [1]. Absolute, spatially
averaged Rydberg densities are obtained from knife-edge
measurements of the dye laser beam waist, 5p3/2 ﬂuores-
cence imaging, and calibration of the microchannel plate
detector. These estimated densities are systematically
uncertain by a factor of 2.

Figure 2a) shows a microwave spectrum of the two-
photon probe transition without the application of a
transfer pulse. This is well-matched by a superimposed
sinc2(πf T ) lineshape suitable for a square excitation
pulse of duration T = 6 µs. As expected, inhomogeneous
Zeeman broadening makes a negligible contribution to
the linewidth [17].

We enhance the interactions between Rydberg atoms
by introducing a microwave pulse shortly after photoex-
citation, transferring 50% of atoms to the 46p3/2 state,
before application of the two-photon 45d5/2 − 46d5/2
probe pulse. Unlike the two-photon probe pulse, the one-
photon transition is broadened by several MHz due to
the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [17]. We do not ob-

serve any Rabi ﬂopping for this “transfer” transition and
consequently do not investigate the possibility of prepar-
ing coherent superpositions of these two states. With a
total Rydberg density of 107 cm−3, converting half of
the initially excited 45d5/2 atoms to the 46p3/2 state
consistently broadens the linewidth of the two-photon
45d5/2 − 46d5/2 probe transition from 160 ± 5 kHz to
192 ± 5 kHz – see Fig. 2 (all widths in this paper are
full-width half-maxima).

As mentioned previously, ﬂuctuations in Rydberg state
excitation eﬃciency may be exploited to accumulate
data over a broad range of density conditions. To an-
alyze linewidths quantitatively a sinc2(πf T ) lineshape
(T = 6 µs) is convolved by a Lorentzian with a vari-
able width δν adjusted for the best least-squares ﬁt to
individual spectra. The Lorentzian form is supported by
a theoretical model (vide infra). Figure 3 shows δν both
with and without introduction of the 46p3/2 atoms, as
a function of average Rydberg density. With decreasing
density δν approaches zero, suggesting the inﬂuence of in-
teratomic interactions – which inevitably weaken at the
large average separations corresponding to low densities.
The diﬀerence in linewidths with and without the
46p3/2 atoms can be attributed to resonant electric
dipole-dipole interactions. To obtain estimates of the
line broadening we consider interactions between pairs of
atoms (A and B) due to the electric dipole-dipole inter-

where ~µA and ~µB are the electric dipole matrix el-
ement operators evaluated on each atom, ~n is the
unit vector pointing between the atoms, and RAB is
the separation of the two atoms.
This perturba-
tion may split the otherwise energy degenerate states
|1 >= |45d5/2mj,A1 >A |46p3/2mj,B1 >B and |2 >=
|46p3/2mj,A2 >A |45d5/2mj,B2 >B, and with a 50% mix-
ture of 45d5/2 and 46p3/2 atoms we can obtain a very
rough idea of the magnitude of the energy splittings from
∆νdd ≈ µ2/R3, where µ = |<45d5/2,1/2|µz|46p3/2,1/2>| ≈
0.49|<45d5/2|r|46p3/2>|, R = (4πn46p/3)−1/3, and n46p
is the 46p3/2 number density. The radial matrix element
is evaluated by numerical integration of the Rydberg elec-
tron wave functions (see Fig. 1b) [18]. The 45d5/2 and
46p3/2 states are strongly dipole coupled, whereas the
46d5/2 and 46p3/2 states are not. Therefore, only the ini-
tial state of the two-photon probe transition is split by
the resonant dipole-dipole interaction with 46p3/2 atoms.
A density of n46p = 5 × 106 cm−3 gives ∆νdd = 33 KHz –
the same order of magnitude as the observed broadening
(see Fig. 3).

The dipole-coupling between the 45d5/2 and 45p3/2
states is much smaller than that between the 45d5/2 and
46p3/2 states (see Fig. 1b)). This suggests the follow-
ing test.
Instead of transferring 50% of the atoms to
the 46p3/2 state, we transfer 50% of atoms to the 45p3/2
state, and study the broadening of the probe transi-
tion with increasing Rydberg atom density. Based on
the much smaller dipole matrix element, it is expected
that introducing the 45p3/2 atoms will have little in-
ﬂuence on the linewidth of the probe transition. Fig-
ure 3 shows that the introduction of the 45p3/2 atoms
gives linewidths which are experimentally indistinguish-
able from the 100% 45d5/2 case.

3

Now we consider a calculation of the linewidths which
accounts for the orientations of the dipole and ~n opera-
tors and the distribution in interacting atom separations
– which were neglected in the simple estimate presented
above. With no magnetic ﬁeld, there is a large energy
degeneracy corresponding to the diﬀerent possible mag-
netic sub-levels for the two atoms (A and B) (without
ˆVdd). However, in the MOT the average Zeeman shifts
are relatively large (≈1 MHz) compared to the inﬂuence
of ˆVdd (<100 kHz). Therefore only those states that are
exactly degenerate are strongly coupled (mj,A1 = mj,B2
and mj,B1 = mj,A2). In the absence of detailed informa-
tion about the magnetic sub-level populations, two ex-
tremes are considered: a) atoms are randomly distributed
over all possible magnetic sub-levels, and b) all atoms are
in mj = 1/2. In the ﬁrst case the eﬀective interaction is
diminished, since there will be pairs of atoms which will
not interact at all (eg. mj,A1 = 5/2, mj,B1 = −3/2).
To simulate the lineshape – in particular the random-
ness associated with RAB and ~n – we consider a 45d5/2
atom at the center of a sphere containing a number of
randomly placed 46p3/2 atoms. The matrix elements
< 1| ˆVdd|2 > are computed using the 45d5/2 atom and
each 46p3/2 within the sphere, using the magnetic sub-
level distribution scenarios discussed above. The matrix
element with the largest magnitude is selected Vmax (a
binary “strongest interacting” neighbor approximation).
This splits the 45d5/2 − 46d5/2 transition into a doublet
±Vmax (the energy eigenvalues of our simpliﬁed two-state
system). This process was repeated numerous times, and
the resulting splittings histogramed to obtain lineshapes,
which converged as the size of the sphere and number
of particles increased (we maintained a constant aver-
age density). These have sharp dips in their centers,
but Lorentzian wings (the dips are much sharper than
the transform-limited linewidth at the densities studied
here).

The simulated lineshapes were convolved with a
sinc2(πf T ) lineshape (T = 6 µs) and ﬁtted in the same
manner as the experimental data (using the sinc2(πf T )
lineshape convolved with a Lorentzian of adjustable
width δνdd). With n46p = 5 × 106 cm−3 (correspond-
ing to 107 cm−3 total density) we get δνdd = 18 kHz
and δνdd = 63 kHz for cases a) and b) discussed above.
As Fig. 3 shows, the experimentally observed increase in
δν at this density is 55 ± 5 kHz – in reasonable agree-
ment with the calculations. In making this comparison,
it is assumed that the mechanism producing the density-
dependent δν observed with no 46p3/2 atoms,
is also
present with the introduction of 46p3/2 atoms, and its
contribution is additive – which should be reconsidered
in a more precise study. Our Rydberg density estimate is
uncertain by a factor of two, and thus an improvement in
this would be desirable for testing the limitations of this
theoretical estimate (eg. binary approximation, magnetic
sub-level distributions, constant linestrengths).

These estimates of line broadening have not accounted
for motion of the Rydberg atoms. Consider two atoms

4

separated by 35 µm, heading towards each other with
a relative speed of 0.4 m/s (typical of a density of
5 × 106 cm−3 and a temperature of 300 µK). Over the
8 µs of the experiment their relative distance will change
by only 9 %. The acceleration of 45d5/2 and 46p3/2 atoms
towards (or away from) one another – due to the gradi-
ent of Vdd – should also be considered [19]. The force
| ~F | = |~∇Vdd| ≈ 3µ2/R4 produces a relative acceleration
of 25 m/s2 at a separation of 35 µm. Over 8 µs, this ac-
celeration does not change the separation appreciably –
the assumption of interactions between stationary atoms
is reasonable.
In this regard, our translationally cold
Rydberg atoms are analogous to amorphous solid-state
systems [20]. However, since the force due to ˆVdd has a
strong R dependence, and the atoms do have some ther-
mal motion, there will be a (small) fraction of close atom
pairs for which movement should not be neglected, es-
pecially at higher densities than those considered here
[19].

With no deliberate introduction of 46p3/2 atoms it is
observed that linewidth broadens linearly with Rydberg
density (see Fig. 3). Non-resonant dipole-dipole interac-
tions are too weak to explain this, and would not show a
linear density dependence. We are at densities well below
the regime of spontaneous plasma formation [15, 21] (we
observe an ion signal that is 3 % of the Rydberg signal at
107 cm−3 – too low to give appreciable broadening due
to the Stark eﬀect from inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds).
Trapped electron collisions [22] could broaden the tran-

sition lines. Again, we do not expect these to give a
linear density dependence. The arguments of the previ-
ous paragraph rule out collisions between cold Rydberg
atoms, but collisions with hot Rydberg atoms from the
background vapor may be important [15]. At a density of
107cm−3 we observe signiﬁcant (≈ 10%) redistribution of
the initially excited Rydberg state population into higher
angular momentum states (l > 2), and this redistribution
scales linearly with Rydberg density – like the observed
broadening. The observed redistribution rate diminishes
in time following photoexcitation, as expected for colli-
sions with hot atoms (which diﬀuse from the excitation
region). Thus we believe that either collisions with the
hot Rydberg atoms, or the products of these collisions,
are responsible for the broadening, and are currently in-
vestigating the speciﬁc mechanism.

In summary, we have observed line-broadening in the
microwave spectra of Rydberg atoms due to resonant
electric dipole-dipole interactions, using a combination
of laser and microwave excitation sources. This is a gen-
eral approach to the study of cold Rydberg atom inter-
actions. For example, a combination of crossed optical
excitation beams (to achieve a small excitation volume)
together with microwave transitions could allow observa-
tion of the dipole blockade phenomena [3].

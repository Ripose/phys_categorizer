The Coulomb Green’s Function in Two Dimensions

Abstract

We consider the two-dimensional non-relativistic Coulomb problem with the aid
of the momentum space construction of the associated Green’s function. Our presen-
tation has precursors in three dimensions. It is mainly Schwinger’s approach which
we advocate and project onto two dimensions.

1 Introduction

Its
The quantum mechanical Coulomb problem plays a central role in atomic physics.
solution is commonly studied using Schr¨odinger’s wave equation, wherein the bound state
spectrum as well as the scattering states can be exhibited by employing either spherical or
parabolic coordinates. One should not forget, however, that is was Pauli who gave the ﬁrst
solution of the hydrogen atom with the aid of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector which makes
the H-atom a dynamical symmetry problem in group theory. Finally there is the powerful
method of Green’s functions which contains all information about the system. For our case
it means that if one is able to present a closed-form expression for the Coulomb Green’s
function, one can immediately extract the energy spectrum as well as the wave functions.
Hence we have to solve the Green’s function equation or the associated integral equation
for the Coulomb potential.

In the sequel it is our goal to help the reader to analyze the Coulomb problem once
again using the language of Green’s functions, but this time in two spatial dimensions.
Admittedly the three dimensional problem is the physically important one and technically
somewhat more complicated than the two-dimensional case; it seems to us, however, that
a pedagogical discussion of the two-dimensional Green’s function for the Coulomb problem
should be of wide interest.

Our treatment will be reminiscent of Schwinger’s paper1. There are, however, calcu-
lations based on the hydrogen wave function in momentum space that date back to V.A.
Fock2 and V. Bargmann3. The paper by B. Podolsky and L. Pauling4 is yet another impor-
tant contribution. Along the same line of thought are the articles furnished by the authors

1

in Ref. 5 and 6. Two more recent pedagogically noteworthy articles were provided by B.R.
Holstein7 and G.S. Adkins8. The nice review article by M. Lieber9 and his contribution in
Ref. 10 is also worth mentioning. In the beginning there stands, of course, Pauli’s seminal
work on the hydrogen atom11.

2 The 2-D Hydrogen Atom in Momentum Space and

its Projection onto the Fock Sphere in 3-D

Since the problem has already been discussed in this Journal12 we will merely list some of
the well-known results following from the existence of the conserved Laplace-Runge-Lenz
vector. But we will also remind the reader of Fock’s and Bargmann’s work in the context of
the simpler two-dimensional Coulomb problem and so assist the student in understanding
their contribution as well.

In two dimensions, the Hamiltonian is given by

The angular momentum vector has only one component, L = L3, and the Runge-Lenz
vector degenerates to a two-dimensional vector, A = (A1, A2) . In 2-D one ﬁnds (¯h = 1):

On the left-hand side of this equation we made use of (11): mZe2 = Z

The result (16) can be checked for the ground state A = 0, which requires (p2

In the sequel we will be interested in commutation relations [X, Y ] = Z. Say we have
¯X = F −1 X F , which is called a similarity transformation, maintaining algebraic properties.
We encounter such a situation in Eq.
If we want simple
commutation relations, we must look in the middle, i.e., in the square brackets of (16),
as the wings cannot be eﬀective. To do so we consider a change of variables to eliminate
∂
the p
∂p term in (16), which can be accomplished by projecting the 2-D momentum space
·
onto the 3-D sphere in the same way that Fock did for the 3-D momentum space problem.
Hence we introduce the stereographic projection.

i.e., deﬁnes the unit sphere in a 3-D Euclidean space. In Eq. (16) we need

A in (21) and L on the right-hand side of (24) look quite diﬀerent. But it is possible to
write them in the same form. To do this we must get of the Fock sphere, which is our unit
sphere in 3-D space. Recall that, up until now, ξ0 has not been an independent variable:
ξ2. Now let us think of ξ0 as being independent. Then the following obvious
ξ2
0 = 1
relation exists between our former spatial derivative, where ξ0 was constrained, and a new
derivative, where ξ0 is now an independent variable:

Eq. (25) is just a rotation connecting the 0-axis with the k-th axis (k = 1, 2). This, then,
is the meaning of A as a generator of rotation. Our whole algebra becomes evident when
we write

l = 0, 1, 2 . . . .

The eigenfunctions are, of course, the spherical harmonics Ylm(Ω). So we obtain

L2 Ylm = l(l + 1) Ylm,

and the quantum number m can take all the integer values from
degeneracy of the energy state is 2l + 1.

Finally we want to demonstrate that Pauli’s treatment of the H-Atom leads directly to
the method developed by Fock2. We hereby take advantage of Bargmann’s work3, which
we adopt for two spatial dimensions.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we have studied the quantum mechanical Coulomb problem in two spatial
dimensions. Although it is true that the three-dimensional analogue is the more important
– since physical – one, it seems to us that the two-dimensional model helps immensely
to understand the mathematical aspect of the real three-dimensional case. Spherical har-
monics on the two-sphere are certainly more familiar than the ones on the three-sphere.
Following the strategy initiated by Fock, Pauli and Schwinger, we were able to solve the
two-dimensional Coulomb problem analytically, i.e., we presented the exact Green’s func-
tion for the two-dimensional hydrogen atom. Exact formulas were then given for both the
discrete and the continuous parts of the spectrum. We hope that by studying the present
paper the reader will not have any problem reproducing Schwinger’s superb paper1 on the
same subject.

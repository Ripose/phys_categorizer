Abstract

The resonant spectra of hydrogen and anti-hydrogen atoms in the presence of

an external electric ﬁeld are compared theoretically. It is shown that nonreso-

nant corrections to the transition frequency contain terms linear in the electric

ﬁeld. The existence of these terms does not violate space and time parity and

leads to a diﬀerence in the resonant spectroscopic measurements for hydrogen

and anti-hydrogen atoms in an external electric ﬁeld. The one-photon 1s

2p

−

and the two-photon 1s

2s resonances are investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent experimental success in the production of anti-hydrogen atoms [1], [2] makes pro-

posals for the search of CPT-violating eﬀects via accurate comparison between spectra of

hydrogen (H) and anti-hydrogen (H) atoms [3] rather realistic. The most accurate exper-

iments have been performed recently for the one-photon 1s

2p and two-photon 1s

2s

−

−

resonances in the H atom [4]- [6].

The situation necessitates the investigation of all possible reasons for diﬀerences in the

H and H spectra. One of these reasons is due to the presence of the external electric ﬁeld.

1

The electric ﬁeld is included in the scheme of the two-photon resonance measurement [5], [6]

and can also be present in other facilities, where experiments with antiprotons are intended

to be performed. It is well known that transition rates in atoms can depend linearly on the

external electric ﬁeld [7]- [9] and thus may diﬀer for the H and H atoms, respectively.

The energy levels of atoms can not depend linearly on the electric ﬁeld without violation

of P and T (space and time) invariance. The known ”linear” Stark eﬀect in a H atom provides

a dependence of atomic energy levels on the absolute value

and thus will not lead to diﬀerences in H and H spectra. However, there is a

ﬁeld strength ~

limit for unambigous measurements of the transition frequency, i.e. for the determination of

the energy levels set by the distortion (asymmetry) of the natural spectral line proﬁles. This

asymmetry arises mainly due to the nonresonant (NR) corrections to the resonant Lorentz

line proﬁle. Nonresonant corrections have been ﬁrst introduced by F. Low [10] and recently

evaluated for 1s

2p [11], [12] and estimated for 1s

2s [12], [13] transitions. Another source

−

−

of the line proﬁle asymmetry is the dependence of the level width Γ(ω) on the frequency ω

[13].

The asymmetric line proﬁle cannot be described by the two parameters energy E and

width Γ, respectively. Thus the determination of the transition frequency becomes ambigous

and knowledge about the nonresonant corrections is required in order to compare the results

of a transition-frequency measurement (by the deducing the maximum of the frequency

distribution or the line center etc) with the theoretical value for the energy diﬀerence between

the two levels. The nonresonant corrections, unlike all other energy corrections depend on

the excitation mechanism.

Moreover, in the external electric ﬁeld the nonresonant corrections can depend linearly

on the ﬁeld thus giving rise to a diﬀerence in measurements of frequencies in H and H

spectra. In this paper we present the evaluation of such an eﬀect for the one-photon 1s

2p

−

and two-photon 1s

2s resonances in H and H atoms, respectively.

II. NONRESONANT CORRECTIONS TO THE 1S − 2P ONE-PHOTON

RESONANCE

Consider the process of elastic resonant photon scattering on the ground state of H and

H atoms in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld. The photon frequency may be close

to the 1s

2p1/2 transition energy. The external electric ﬁeld is assumed to mix 2p1/2

−

and 2s1/2 states, but not the 2p3/2- and 2s1/2-states. The major contribution to the eﬀect

under considerating originates from the 2s1/2 state which is closest to the resonant 2p1/2

state. Accordingly, the magnitude

of the electric ﬁeld optimal for observing the eﬀect

corresponds to a Stark parameter ξ

contribution comes from the ﬁrst term. Similar expressions for the corresponding absorption

The formal T-noninvariance of the factor (~ν ~F ) in Eq. (7) (~ν and ~F are T-odd and T-even

vectors, respectively) is compensated by the linear dependence on Γ2p in Eq. (7): this is

a well known imitation of T-nonivariance in unstable systems as it has been predicted by

Zel′dovich [16]. Such a case of T-noninvariance has been discussed in [7]- [9].

Eq. (7) deﬁnes a measurable diﬀerence between the 1s

2p transition frequency in H

−

and H atoms. A direct observation of this diﬀerence seems rather unlikely at present, since

the inaccuaracy of the Lyman-alpha transition measurement is about 6 MHz [4], i.e. more

than 1010 orders of magnitude larger than the correction (7).

Note, that the part of the correction xNR independent on the ﬁeld direction, and thus

equal in H and H, is only 103 times smaller than the inaccuracy in [4]. A direct observation

of the distortion of the natural line proﬁle due to NR corrections would be of special interest

irrelevant of the comparison of the H and H spectra.

IV. THE 1S − 2S TWO-PHOTON RESONANCE

In this section we will investigate the NR corrections to the transition frequency in the

1s

2s two-photon resonance in H and H atoms. In the highly accurate experiment [5], [6]

−
on the 1s

−

2s two-photon excitation in hydrogen an inaccuracy of 46 Hz has been achieved.

However, the experiment [5], [6] is based on special time-delay techniques. The region,

where the excitation process 1s + 2γ

2s occurs, is separated from the detection region

by some ﬁnite distance S. In the detection region a “small” quenching ﬁeld is applied and

the one-photon decay 2s′

1s + γ is observed. With a spatial separation S

by td = (ξ2Γ2p)

tD. Thus the atoms that reach the detection region will decay

immediatly and the experimental decay line proﬁle will be determinated exclusively by tD.

In the absence of an external electric ﬁeld the nonresonant corrections for 1s

2s two-

−

photon resonance have been estimated in [12]. These corrections are deﬁned by the inter-

ference between the amplitudes corresponding to the Feynman graph of Fig. 2 with n = 2

and the Feynman graphs in Fig. 2 with n = 3, 4, ... In this case the nonresonant correction

appears to be negligible:

xNR

10−14 Hz [12].

|

| ∼

In the presence of the electric ﬁeld the situation may change drastically. However, an

exact quantum electrodynamical description of the resonant process with the time-delayed

decay is not obvious:

it would require the introduction of the S-matrix deﬁned for ﬁnite

time intervals. This would cause many diﬃculties, among which the problem of the renor-

malizability of the amplitudes seems to be most striking one.

In [5] a simpliﬁed quantum mechanical approach based on the density matrix formalism

has been employed for the description of the resonance line shape of the 1s

2s two-photon

−

excitation process with delayed registration by the electric ﬁeld quenching. Still it is not

quite evident how to introduce nonresonant corrections within this approach.

In [13] an

estimate for xNR based on purely phenomenological considerations has been provided. An

accurate and reliable value for xNR for the experiments [5], [6] is still not available. Leaving

a solution of this problem for future studies, in this paper we will investigate a process

opposite to one considered in [12]: the two-photon 1s

2s excitation and decay in external

−

electric ﬁelds. The case considered here will correspond to ξ = 1, while the case of Ref. [12]

corresponds to ξ = 0.

We have to stress that our case diﬀers also from the real experiment [5], [6] where the

electric ﬁeld is present only in the region where the decay process takes place (“decay part”),

7

not in the “excitation part”. The process with the electric ﬁeld present all the time loses, of

course, most of the advantages of the experimental approach developed in [5], [6] and should

provide much poorer accuracy. Still it is preferable for the search of the diﬀerence in the

transition frequency measurements in H and H atoms in electric ﬁelds.

The Feynman graphs, corresponding to the resonant two-photon excitation process 1s′ +

2s′ and the dominant nonresonant contribution are depicted in Fig. 3. We neglect

2γ

the correction due to the quadratic Stark eﬀect for the 1s-ground state. Even for ξ = 1

this correction is of relative order 10−12. Within the approximation depicted in Fig. 3 an

expression for the diﬀerential cross section similar to Eq. (2) can be derived

In this paper we have shown, that resonant atomic spectra in the external electric ﬁelds

alpha resonances in H and H atoms are shifted relative to each other by the value 2

place in external electric ﬁelds.

In an electric ﬁeld with ξ = 1 the nonresonant corrections, independent from the ﬁeld

direction appear to be 1000 times larger, than the nonresonant corrections in the absence of

the ﬁeld.

This enhancement is connected with the overlap of resonances with identical quantum

numbers. This overlap has been studied theoretically for highly-charged ions in [17]. In the

case of H and H atoms the 2p′, 2s′ levels in the ﬁeld ξ = 1 actually do not overlap, but unlike

the 2p, 2s levels they have identical quantum numbers. Since these levels are still close to

each other, their mutual inﬂuence results in large NR corrections.

We also would like to mention another eﬀect that looks diﬀerent in hydrogen and anti-

hydrogen atoms placed in external electric ﬁelds. This is the eﬀect of quantum beats in the

Lyman-alpha radiation. It has been investigated theoretically and experimentally by many

authors: see [18]- [23]. Quantum beats arise ﬁrstly, due to the interference of the 2s′, 2p′

states in the external ﬁeld. However, this ﬁeld-induced eﬀect is independent of the ﬁeld

direction, i.e.

it will be the same for H and H atoms. If the additional requirement of a

coherent excitation of the 2s′, 2p′ states is satisﬁed, the quantum-beats signal will be linear

in the electric ﬁeld [22]. This implies that quantum beats signal for H and H atoms after

subtraction of the part independent on the ﬁeld direction will exhibit a relative phase shift

of π in the same electric ﬁeld. The coherent excitation may arise in beam-foil experiments

[20]- [23] or with the laser excitation if the laser bandwidth is larger than ∆EL.

In the

experiment [4] the laser bandwidth was about 10 MHz, i.e. about 100 times smaller than

∆EL. Using another sources of radiation with larger bandwidth one may hope to observe

this phase shift for quantum beats in H and H atoms.

FIG. 3. The Feynman graphs corresponding to the two-photon resonant excitation of H and H

in an external electric ﬁeld. The double solid lines denote bounded atomic electrons (positrons) in

an external electric ﬁeld. The ground state is assumed to be unaﬀected by the electric ﬁeld. The

other notations are the same as Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 3a) corresponds to the resonant contribution

and Fig. 3b) corresponds to the leading nonresonant contribution, respectively.

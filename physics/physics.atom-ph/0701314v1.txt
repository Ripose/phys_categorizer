Double energy diﬀerential cross sections for the Coulomb four-body problem in a
quasiclassical framework

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

In a quasiclassical framework, we formulate the double energy diﬀerential cross sections for the
Coulomb four-body problem. We present results for the triple photoionization from the Li ground
state at 220.5, 115, 50 and 3.8 eV excess energies. With the energy of one of the electrons kept
ﬁxed, the double energy diﬀerential cross sections at 220.5 and 115 excess energies are found to be
of “U-shape” (unequal energy sharing), with those at 115 eV being in very good agreement with ab-
initio results. At 50 eV, it seems that a transition starts taking place to more equal energy sharing
conﬁgurations. Close to threshold, at 3.8 eV excess energy, the equal energy sharing conﬁgurations
are the dominant ones.

INTRODUCTION

The single photon double ionization of the helium atom
(Coulomb three-body problem) is by now well stydied.
There are several theoretical approaches and experimen-
tal results in good agreement with each other for total
as well as for diﬀerential cross sections [1]. At the same
time the single photon triple ionization of the lithium
atom (Coulomb four-body problem) is still largely unex-
plored.

Regarding the total triple photoionization cross section
from the ground state of Li the few existing theoretical
results [2, 3, 4] are in good agreement with experiment
[5, 6]. However, for diﬀerential cross sections of three es-
caping electrons the theoretical studies are very limited
with no experimental results currently available. The
small number of theoretical studies and the current lack
of experimental ones is partly due to the very small val-
ues of the diﬀerential cross sections. With the highest
value of the total triple photoionization cross section for
Li being a few barns, the diﬀerential ones are even smaller
since they sample only part of the outgoing ﬂux. How-
ever, there are recent experimental results for diﬀerential
cross sections of three outgoing electrons for the electron-
impact double ionization of helium. These experiments
measure the angular distribution of two ionized electrons
when the incoming electron is very fast [7] and more re-
cently measurements were obtained for incident electrons
of much lower energy [8]. The theoretical work on diﬀer-
ential cross sections for triple photoionization from the
Li ground state include: a) A study of selection rules
for diﬀerent electron-momenta conﬁgurations in the three
electron escape [9]. In this work, various relative angular
distributions of one of the outgoing electrons (for a given
relative angle of the other two electrons) were presented
using correlated 6 C (Coulomb) ﬁnal state wavefunctions.
b) There is also a very recent study of energy diﬀeren-
tial cross sections for photon energies of 280, 300 and
320 eV for the triple photoionization of Li using the non-
perturbative time-dependent close coupling method [10].
c) Finally, in ref [11] the angular correlation probability

is evaluated in the framework of classical mechanics. The
angular correlation depends only on the relative angle be-
tween any pair of ionized electrons in the three electron
escape.

In the current paper, we investigate double energy dif-
ferential cross sections for the triple photoionization from
the Li ground state. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time
double energy diﬀerential cross sections are formulated
classically. Energy diﬀerential cross sections for the com-
plete break-up of the Li atom are much more diﬃcult
to interpret compared to those for the complete break-
up of the He atom. For two electron escape, for a given
excess energy, there is only one energy diﬀerential cross
section as a function of one electron’s energy. For three
electron escape, for a given excess energy, a diﬀerent dou-
ble energy diﬀerential cross section, as a function of one
electron’s energy, is obtained for each energy assigned to
one of the electrons (see below slices through diﬀerential
cross sections). Our results are obtained using a quasi-
classical formulation which has been outlined elsewhere
but we include it here as well, in section IIA, for com-
pleteness of the paper. The classical nature of our investi-
gation results in three distinguishable escaping electrons.
In section IIB, we outline how starting from the double
energy diﬀerential cross sections of the three distinguish-
able electrons we obtain fully symmetrized ones. Note
that, in an ab-initio formulation the symmetry proper-
ties of the diﬀerential cross section are a natural outcome
of using a fully antisymmetric wavefunction to describe
the three electron state. In section IIC, we discuss how
the double energy diﬀerential cross sections are computed
numerically. In section III, we present the double energy
diﬀerential cross sections for four diﬀerent excess ener-
gies. For 115 eV our results are in very good agreement
with the ab-initio double energy diﬀerential cross sections
in ref[10] for a photon energy of 320 eV. Given that the
ionization energy of the Li ground state is equal to 203.5
eV, 320 eV photon energy corresponds to an excess en-
ergy close to 115 eV. We ﬁnd that the “U-shape” is even
more pronounced for an excess energy of 220.5 eV. At 50
eV, it seems that a transition starts taking place from a

“U-shape” to a more equal energy sharing conﬁguration.
We ﬁnd that at 3.8 eV the slices through the double en-
ergy diﬀerential cross section have transitioned roughly
to shapes where equal energy sharing is favored.

II. QUASICLASSICAL FORMULATION OF
SINGLE PHOTON MULTIPLE IONIZATION

A.
Initial phase space density and its time
evolution for single photon triple ionization

The construction of the initial phase space density ρ(γ)
in our quasiclassical formulation of the triple photoion-
ization of Li has been detailed in [4], here we give only a
brief summary. We formulate the triple photoionization
process from the Li ground state (1s22s) as a two step
process. First, one electron absorbs the photon (photo-
electron) at time t = tabs = 0. Through electronic corre-
lations, the energy gets redistributed, resulting in three
electrons escaping to the continuum. Our formulation ac-
counts for the second step. We ﬁrst assume that the pho-
ton is absorbed by a 1s-electron at the nucleus (r1 = 0).
This latter, approximation becomes exact in the limit of
high photon energy [12]. The cross section for photon
absorption from a 1s orbital is much larger than from
a 2s orbital [13]. Hence, we can safely assume that the
photo-electron is a 1s electron which signiﬁcantly reduces
the initial phase space to be sampled. Also, by virtue of
their diﬀerent character the electrons become practically
distinguishable and allow us to neglect antisymmetriza-
tion of the initial state. We denote the photo-electron by
1, the other 1s electron by 2 and the 2s electron by 3.
Following photon absorption, we model the initial phase
space distribution of the remaining two electrons, 1s and
2s, by the Wigner transform of the corresponding initial
wavefunction ψ(r1 = 0, r2, r3), where ri are the electron
vectors starting at the nucleus. We approximate the ini-
tial wavefunction as a simple product of hydrogenic or-
bitals φZi
i (ri) with eﬀective charges Zi, to facilitate the
Wigner transformation. The Zi are chosen so that they
reproduce the known ionization potentials Ii, namely for
the 2s electron Z3 = 1.259 (I3 = 0.198 a.u.) and for the
1s electron Z2 = 2.358 (I2 = 2.780 a.u.). (We use atomic
units throughout the paper if not stated otherwise.) The
excess energy, E, is given by E = Eω − I with Eω the
photon energy and I = 7.478 a.u. the Li triple ionization
threshold energy. Given the above considerations, the
initial phase space density is given by

ρ(γ) = N δ(r1)δ(E1 + I1 − ω)

Wφ

(ri, pi)δ(Ei + Ii)

Yi=2,3

with normalization constant N .

We next determine which fraction of ρ(γ) leads to
triple ionization, by following the phase space distribu-
tion in time. The evolution of a classical phase space

2

(2)

(3)

density is determined by the classical Liouville equation

∂ρ(Γ(t))
∂t

= Lclρ(Γ(t)),

with the initial phase space values being

Γ(0) ≡ γ ,

and Lcl the classical Liouville operator which is deﬁned
by the Poisson bracket {H, }, with H the Hamiltonian of
the system. In our case H is the full Coulomb four-body
Hamiltonian. In practice, Eq. (2) amounts to discretizing
the initial phase space, assigning weights to each discrete
point γj = (pj(0), qj(0)) according to ρ(γj), and evolv-
ing in time each initial condition γj with the Coulomb
four-body Hamiltonian. This amounts to propagating
electron trajectories using the classical equations of mo-
tion (Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo method [14, 15]).
Regularized coordinates [16] are used to avoid problems
with electron trajectories starting at the nucleus. We
label as triple ionizing those trajectories with the ener-
gies oﬀ all three electrons being, asymptotically in time,
Ei > 0, with i = 1, 2, 3.

B. Double diﬀerential probabilities

Our goal is to formulate the double energy diﬀerential
cross section d2σ3+/dEαdEβ.
It should be such that
when doubly integrating over it the total triple ionization
cross section is recovered:

E

E−Eα

σ3+ =

Z
0

dEα Z

0

dEβ

d2σ3+
dEαdEβ

E

E−Eα

≡ σabs Z

0

dEα Z

0

dEβ

d2P 3+
dEαdEβ

.

(4)

σabs is the total photoabsorption cross section at ex-
cess energy E, which we take from experimental data for
the Li ground state [17]. In what follows, we formulate
d2P 3+/dEαdEβ .

As it has already been mentioned in section IIA, by
considering a product of hydrogenic orbitals as our ini-
tial state, we neglect antisymmetrization in the initial
state. The three escaping electrons are distinguishable
resulting in three distinct double diﬀerential probabili-
ties d2P 3+(Ei, Ej)/dEidEj with the energy of the third
electron being Ek = E − Ei − Ej from conservation of
energy and i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, i < j . We next symmetrize
each one of the above three double diﬀerential proba-
bilities as follows: d2P 3+(Ei, Ej )/dEidEj should be a)
symmetric under exchange of the electron indices, that is,
it should have the same value when Ei → Ej since elec-
trons i and j are indistinguishable; b) for constant energy
Ei the double diﬀerential probability, which is now only
a function of Ej, should be symmetric with respect to
(E − Ei)/2 since electrons j and k are indistinguishable;
for constant energy Ej the double diﬀerential probability,

which is now only a function of Ei, should be symmetric
with respect to (E − Ej)/2 since electrons i and k are in-
distinguishable; The double diﬀerential probability that
satisﬁes the above properties is of the following form:

d2P 3+

(

=

sym(Ei, Ej)
dEidEj
d2P 3+(Ei, E − Ei − Ej)

d2P 3+(Ej, E − Ei − Ej )

d2P 3+(Ei, Ej )

dEidEj

+

+

d2P 3+(E − Ei − Ej , Ei)
dEidEj
d2P 3+(E − Ei − Ej, Ej)
dEidEj

),

(5)

It now follows that the symmetrized double diﬀerential
probability is given by:

d2P 3+(Eα, Eβ)
dEαdEβ

=

(

d2P 3+

where the normalization factor follows from

= P 3+.

C. Numerical evaluation of double diﬀerential
probabilities

To

the

evaluate

numerically

three
dP 3+(Ei, Ej )/dEidEj we divide the energy surface
[0, E][0, E] into N 2 equally sized square bins. We then
ﬁnd the triple ionized trajectories which fall into the bins
and add up their weights. Note that from conservation
of energy the double energy diﬀerential probabilities
map out a triangle, see section III. In the next section
we present results for 220.5, 115, 50 and 3.8 eV excess
energy. The size of N is chosen so that we have a small
standard relative error for each square bin (the error is
inversely proportional to the square root of the number
of triple ionizing events in a given square bin [14]). For
each of the excess energies currently under investigation
the number of triple ionizing trajectories used in our
computations was no less than 8000.

III. RESULTS

In this section we present results for excess energies
of 220.5, 115, 50 and 3.8 eV. Our choice of excess ener-
gies allows us to investigate the double diﬀerential cross
sections for energies close to threshold (3.8 eV), close to
the energy where the total cross section is maximum (50
eV) and for higher energies (115 eV and 220.5 eV). Note,
that the 115 and 220.5 eV are in the energy range where
our quasiclassical formulation is still valid (for very high
excess energies one has to treat the problem quantum

3

mechanically). In Fig. 1 we plot the double energy dif-
ferential cross section for three excess energies, namely
220.5, 115 and 3.8 eV. The ﬁgure clearly illustrates that
the double diﬀerential cross section has the symmetries
discussed in section IIB. In addition, one can see that at
large excess energies, 220.5 and 115 eV, the diﬀerential
cross section has a bowl shape (with the bowl shape at
220.5 eV being more pronounced). That is, for a given
energy of one of the electrons the other two electrons
share unequally the remaining energy, see below. On the
other hand, at 3.8 eV for a given energy of one of the
electrons the other two electrons tend to roughly equally
share the remaining energy.

To gain more insight into the double diﬀerential cross
sections, we consider in ﬁgures 2, 3, 4 and 5 slices through
the double energy diﬀerential cross sections for each of
the four excess energies. That is, ﬁxing the energy of one
of the three escaping electrons, Eα, we plot the double
diﬀerential cross section as a function of the energy of
another escaping electron, Eβ. The energy of the third
outgoing electron can be found from conservation of en-
ergy. For all excess energies considered the energy sur-
face [0, E][0, E] is binned in N 2 squares with N = 14 for
220.5, 115, 50 eV while N = 10 for 3.8 eV. Our choice of
N accurately accounts for the shapes of the slices through
the double diﬀerential cross section for the energies con-
sidered.

In addition, for excess energies of 115 and 220.5 eV we
see that the slices through the double diﬀerential cross
section have a “U-shape” which is more pronounced for
the larger excess energy. The later is the well known
characteristic shape of the single energy diﬀerential cross
section for two outgoing electrons for high photon ener-
gies. In ref[10], the slices through the diﬀerential cross
sections were all found to be of “U-shape” . We next com-
pare our quasicalssical results with the ab-initio results
of ref [10] for 320 eV photon energy. The comparison is
only an approximate one since our binning restricts the
energies Eα we can consider. The value of Eα we use to
compare is the one closer to the energy considered by the
quantum calculations. Also note that the photon energy
of 320 eV corresponds to a slightly higher excess energy
than the 115 eV excess energy favoring a shape of slightly
more unequal energy sharing than the ones considered in
Figs 3a), 3b), 3c). We compare our results for 12.32,
28.75, 53.4 eV respectively with the results of ref[10] for
10, 30, 50 eV (dashed line) in Figs 3a), 3b), 3c). Our
data points are the black circles while the solid lines are
a ﬁt to these data points (the same holds for Figs 2, 4, 5).
We ﬁnd that our results for 115 eV excess energy com-
pare very well with those of ref[10]. The agreement is
very good for intermediate values of Eβ while it is not as
good close to the edges. However, close to the edges, as
the authors in ref[10] point out, their results are less ac-
curate due to some lack of convergence. From Figs 2,3 we
see that for large excess energies of 115 and 220.5 eV, the
smaller Ea is the more pronounced the unequal energy
sharing between the two electrons is. That means that

for a very small energy of one electron a highly unequal
energy sharing is favored among the other two. For a very
large energy of one electron the unequal energy sharing
of the other two is not as pronounced.

We next focus on the slices through the double diﬀer-
ential cross sections for excess energies of 50 and 3.8 eV,
with the later being very close to threshold, see Fig. 4
and Fig. 5. One notices that at 50 eV for Ea = 1.79 eV
(see Fig. 4a)) the maximum of the diﬀerential cross sec-
tion shifts to an energy Eβ 6= 0 unlike the 115 and 220.5
eV excess energy where the maximum is at Eβ = 0. In
addition, one sees from Fig. 4 that equal energy sharing
among two of the electrons is favored for intermediate Eβ
energies (hump in the middle of the Eβ energy range).
It thus, seems, that at 50 eV excess energy a transition
starts taking place from a highly unequal energy sharing
at 220.5 and 115 eV to a more equal one. At 3.8 eV,
an energy very close to threshold, the transition to equal
energy sharing conﬁgurations becomes even more pro-
nounced. A comparison of Figs. 4 and 5 shows that the
maximum of the diﬀerential cross section for 3.8 eV has
shifted to energies Eβ higher than those for 50 eV and for
Eα = 1.71 eV, see Fig. 5c), equal energy sharing is the
favorable conﬁguration. What is also quite interesting is
that at 3.8 eV the slices through the double diﬀerential
cross sections as the energy Eα is increased, see Figs 5a),
5b), 5c), have shapes similar to those of the single en-
ergy diﬀerential cross sections of the two electron escape
for decreasing excess energy close to threshold, see for
example [18].

It is clear that a thorough study of the slices through
the double energy diﬀerentials for the three electron es-
cape is needed for a large number of excess energies. Such
a study can answer the question of how the transition
takes place from a “U-shape” at higher excess energies
(220.5 and 115 eV) to more equal energy sharing for en-
ergies closer to the energy of the maximum of the triple
ionization cross section (50 eV) and ﬁnally to energies
where equal energy sharing is the favorable conﬁguration
(3.8 eV). Understanding how the transition takes place
will ultimately help us understand how the behavior of
the three escaping electrons changes with decreasing ex-
cess energy. To compare with two electron escape, let
us point out that in the latter case a transition of the
single energy diﬀerential cross section takes place from
an unequal energy sharing to an equal sharing one as
the photon energy decreases. For the case of He double
ionization, at 100 eV photon energy (close to the energy
where the maximum of the double ionization cross sec-
tion is) the single energy diﬀerential cross section is ﬂat.
100 eV is the critical energy where the transition from
unequal to equal energy sharing starts taking place for
two electron escape [19, 20]. In addition, for the case of
electron-hydrogen scattering [18], as the excess energy is
decreased (for energies close to threshold) it was found
that the single diﬀerential cross sections have shapes sim-
ilar to those shown in Fig. 5. What are the physical
implications of this similarity for the three electron case

our choice of square bins.

IV. CONLUSIONS

We have presented the ﬁrst to our knowledge quasiclas-
sical study of double energy diﬀerential cross sections for
the triple ionization of the lithium ground state. Our
results for 115 eV are in good agreement with ab-initio
calculations, indicating that our simple initial state of
a product wavefunction correctly captures the essential
features of the triple ionization process by single photon
absorption from the Li ground state. We believe that
our ﬁrst results on how the transition towards thresh-
old takes place will be the impetus for future studies of
double energy diﬀerentials cross sections as the excess en-
ergy is reduced down to threshold. It could be the case
that these detailed studies for a large number of excess
energies will allow a connection between the shapes of
the double energy diﬀerential cross sections and the se-
quences of collisions the three electrons follow to escape
[11] .

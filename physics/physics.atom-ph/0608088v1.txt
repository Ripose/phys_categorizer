A theoretical investigation of forced evaporative cooling in radio–frequency (rf) adiabatic poten-
tials is presented. Supposing the atoms to be trapped by a rf ﬁeld at ω1, the cooling procedure is
developed around a second ω2 rf source. This second rf ﬁeld forces the spin state dressed by ω1 to
adiabatically follow a time–evolving quantization axis. The evaporation is then possible by quench-
ing the adiabatic following spin dynamics. Our results show that when ω1 and ω2 are comparable,
counter–intuitive evaporation zones appear making this process more eﬃcient. On the other hand,
because of beating between the two rf signals, a pulsed evaporative cooling scheme seems to be the
optimal strategy to reduce the temperature of the rf–trapped atoms.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the investigation of quantum gases in
low–dimensional trapping geometries has signiﬁcantly at-
tracted the attention of the condensed matter physics re-
search community. This growing interest is motivated,
partially, by the current possibilities that the extremely
rapid progress in integrated atom optics has opened
for the manipulation of Bose–Einstein condensed (BEC)
atoms. This development allows the study of crucial
problems associated with the strong modiﬁcations that
the fundamental properties of these quantum systems ex-
perience due to the reduced dimensionality. For instance,
a 1D Bose gas in the Tonks–Girardeau regime mimics
a system of non–interacting spinless fermions [1, 2]; in
2D, the superﬂuidity emerges due to the vortex binding–
unbinding Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transi-
tion [3, 4], recently observed [5].

For the study of the BEC low–dimensional physics,
trapping conﬁgurations of diﬀerent nature and topology
has been proposed and used. For example, the 3D to
1D crossover in elongated Ioﬀe–Pritchard type direct–
current (dc) magnetic trap was explored by G¨orlitz et al.
in [6], the phase defects of a BEC were investigated in
a quasi–2D trap based on a 1D optical lattice [7] and,
in atom chip experiments, dc current–carying wires are
usually employed to trap atoms [8]. Although these trap-
ping conﬁgurations have demonstrated their relevance for
studying quantum gases in low dimensions, adiabatic po-
tentials [9], resulting from a combination of dc and radio–
frequency (rf) magnetic ﬁelds, are becoming a very at-
tractive and promising tool.

The rf traps share the versatility and ﬂexibility of the
above mentioned trapping schemes and, moreover, they
are relatively easy to implement and control. In the ﬁrst
implementation of these traps [10], ultra–cold atoms were
conﬁned in a 2D geometry. A rf adiabatic potential has

∗Electronic address: leonardo@galilee.univ-paris13.fr

also been used as a beam splitter, allowing the demon-
stration of matter–wave interference on an atom chip [11].
Ring–shaped traps, and other more complex trapping ge-
ometries, using this kind of potentials have also been con-
sidered [12, 13, 14, 15].

Given the topology of the rf trapping potential, and be-
cause of technical limitations in some cases, the loading
of the trap with Bose–Einstein condensed atoms, preserv-
ing the quantum degeneracy, can be a challenging task.
In this situation, it is of relevance to consider the possi-
bility of forced evaporative cooling of atoms directly in
these low–dimensional rf traps. This is the subject that
will be addressed in this paper. We will study how a sec-
ond radio–frequency source can be used to performed the
evaporation. As it will be shown, the forced evaporation
of rf–trapped atoms can be accomplished by quenching
the adiabatic following spin evolution induced by this sec-
ond rf source. Since the combination of the trapping rf
ﬁeld and the rf ﬁeld used to cool the sample produces a
ﬁnite modulation of the population of the coldest atoms,
this pulsed scheme seems to be more eﬃcient than the
traditional continuous forced rf evaporative method used
in static magnetic traps [16, 17].

II. DYNAMICS OF THE SYSTEM

A. Adiabatic potential conﬁnement

The underlying idea of the conﬁnement of ultra–cold
atoms using rf adiabatic potentials is presented in details
in [9], being [10] the ﬁrst report on the experimental in-
vestigation of such a trapping scheme. For this reason,
instead of discussing deeply how this trapping actually
takes place, we will rather make use of the already known
results that are relevant in order to consider the problem
of evaporative cooling in these traps.

Let’s begin by assuming that we have a cloud of 87Rb
atoms conﬁned in the Zeeman state m = +2 of the
5S1/2, F = 2 hyperﬁne ground state level. We will
suppose that this conﬁnement is created by a dc mag-

netic ﬁeld Bdc(r) producing a trap in a QUIC conﬁgura-
tion [18, 19]. The atomic clouds trapped in this conﬁg-
uration are anisotropic (cigar–shaped) and we will take
the oﬀset magnetic ﬁeld produced by the Ioﬀe coil to be
oriented along the x direction [the axes in the lab frame
(local frame attached to the dc magnetic ﬁeld) will be
labelled by lower (capital) case letters xyz (XY Z)]. In
our experimental setup [10], for instance, the QUIC trap
center is shifted in the x direction by around 6.9 mm from
the center of the quadrupole trap. The Larmor frequency
of the atomic spin precession in this dc ﬁeld will be de-
noted ω0(r) = gF µBBdcZ(r)/~. Here, gF and µB are the
Land´e factor and the Bohr magneton, respectively.

Now, if we apply to this conﬁned atomic system two
rf ﬁelds (produced by antennae), both of them polarized
along X and of angular frequencies ω1 and ω2, then under
the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and in the frame
rotating at ω1, the Hamiltonian that describes the spin
dynamics can be written as (see the derivation in the
appendix A)

H(r, t) = HA(r) + 2Ω2

FX cos(∆t) + FY sin(∆t)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

, (1)

p

where FX (FY ) is the atomic angular momentum in the
X(Y ) direction, ∆ = ω2 − ω1, HA(r) = Ω(r)Fθ is the
adiabatic Hamiltonian associated with the rf conﬁne-
ment, Ω(r) ≡
δ(r)2 + (2Ω1)2 deﬁnes the energy sepa-
ration between the adiabatic levels, the ﬂip angle θ and
the detuning δ(r) are given by tan(θ) ≡ −2Ω1/δ(r) and
δ(r) = ω1 − ω0(r), respectively. We have labelled the
Rabi frequencies of the rf ﬁelds by Ω1 and Ω2, and we
have considered that the component FZ of the atomic an-
gular momentum is aligned with the local Z component
of the dc magnetic ﬁeld vector. These Rabi frequencies
are not homogeneous however, they can be treated as
such when comparing the geometry of the rf ﬁelds with
the spatial extension of the clouds produced in our ex-
perimental apparatus.

Graphically, the spin evolution given by Eq. (1), in the
case Ω2 = 0, is represented in Fig. 1. It can be seen in
this ﬁgure that the tilted angular momentum Fθ results
from a rotation of FZ around FY and is given by

Fθ = cos(θ)FZ + sin(θ)FX = RY (θ)FZ R†

Y (θ) ,

(2)

where the rotation matrix RY (θ) = exp(−iθFY /~) can
be expressed in the basis {−2, ..., +2} of the bare states.

In Fig. 2(a), the energies of the bare states are plotted
as a function of the position z. This dependency has
been calculated for a value x = xmin corresponding to
the position where the QUIC magnetic ﬁeld is minimal.
Moreover, we have taken y = 0 and a Rabi frequency
Ω1/2π = 200 kHz, a typical value for our experimental
conditions. The arrows shown in that ﬁgure, in blue for
ω1 and in red for ω2 (each frequency stands to the right
of its respective arrows), indicate the locations where the
corresponding rf ﬁelds couple, in resonance, the states
in the laboratory frame. On the other hand, the spatial

therefore precesses around an axis given by Fθ (green arrow).

z dependency of the adiabatic states internal energies is
shown in Fig. 2(b) where the states are labelled, from top
to bottom: |+2Ai, |+1Ai, |0Ai, |−1Ai, and |−2Ai. We
can also see in this last ﬁgure the avoided level crossings
at the positions where ω1 (taken equal to 2π 3.19 MHz
in this example and from now on) resonantly couples the
bare states.

FIG. 2: (color online). Spatial z dependency of the energy
of the uncoupled (a) and dressed (b) states. At the avoided
level crossings, the energy splitting between the levels is 2Ω1.
The gravity has been taken into account in both cases.

In order to consider only the conﬁnement (Ω2 = 0) us-
ing the adiabatic potentials shown in Fig. 2(b), let’s sup-
pose that initially we have a +2 spin polarized ultra–cold
atomic sample. In this situation, the trapping potential
corresponding to the bare state | + 2i can be adiabati-
cally deformed into the one associated with the dressed
state | + 2Ai. Such a transformation can be performed
by changing the detuning δ(r) from red to blue at con-
stant Rabi frequency Ω1 [10] or, by increasing Ω1 at a
constant red detuning [11]. Here, by adiabatic deforma-
tion we mean that the angular precession frequency Ω(r)
of the spin in Fig. 1 must be much larger than the rate

at which the angle θ changes. Using the loading schemes
just mentioned, it is possible to obtain highly anisotropic
rf traps with trapping frequencies, in the strongest con-
ﬁnement direction, ranging from several hundreds of Hz
up to a few kHz.

Having described the main properties of the adiabatic
conﬁnement, let’s now address the following issues. As-
suming intuitively the existence of the resonances repre-
sented by the arrows in Fig. 2(b), we would like to know
precisely where are they located and how strong are they.
Another relevant point to be taken into account concerns
the eﬀect of these resonances at the rf trap center when,
numerically, ω1 and ω2 are close to each other. Moreover,
it will be interesting to ﬁnd out the diﬀerent parameter
values for which the second rf ﬁeld induces transitions
between the adiabatic states, in the perturbative limit,
leading to a possible implementation of a forced evapo-
rative cooling in rf traps.

namics due to the second radio–frequency ﬁeld ω2. Mo-
tivated by the description of the spin evolution in the
adiabatic basis, our ﬁrst step will be to remove the time–
independent term HA in Eq. (1). This step is accom-
plished by passing to the interaction picture where the
evolution of a dressed spin state |Ψ(t)i is governed by the
Hamiltonian H

We will start the study of the evaporative cooling in the
rf trap by solving and analyzing the adiabatic states dy-

In Eq. (3), we have dropped the r dependency for the
sake of writing simpliﬁcation. Making use of Fig. 1 and
introducing F⊥θ = cos(θ)FX − sin(θ)FZ , the angular mo-

The solution of the TDSE (5), and the interpretation
of the results obtained from it, will be the focus of the fol-
lowing sections. In particular, two diﬀerent approaches
will be used to compute the dynamics of |Ψ(t)i. In the
ﬁrst case, the exact numerical solution of Eq. (5) will be
found and, in the second case, an approximated analyti-
cal treatment of this equation will be presented in order
to interprete the exact results derived numerically. Since
the evolution of the atomic external and internal degrees
of freedom takes place in very diﬀerent time scales, here
we will decouple the two dynamics and consider only the
time evolution of the internal degrees of freedom.

Time–dependent Schr¨odinger equations are usually en-
countered when dealing with the dynamics of non–linear
systems and diﬀerent methods, algorithms, have been
utilized to solve them. For an arbitrary integer spin F , as
it has been shown in [16], the investigation of the evapora-
tive cooling dynamics in a static magnetic trap (only one
rf source) can be reduced to the study of the evolution of
the two–level model. In this case, an analytical solution
can be derived.
If the external atomic degree of free-
dom is treated explicitly, the problem becomes tractable
only numerically [20]. When dealing with more than one
rf frequency, an analytical solution for (5) can be found
taking δ ≫ Ω1, Ω2 [21] however, we are not treating this
limiting situation here.

In our particular case, given the relative simplicity of
the Hamiltonian (4), due to the explicit time dependency
via harmonic functions, we will try a numerical solution
using a 4th order Runge–Kutta algorithm. Since the
Eq. (5) is written in the interaction picture, the state

vector |Ψ(t)i can be very eﬃciently propagated in time,
and we do not expect to have convergency problems if we
choose the appropriated time–step [22]. As we can guess
from the form of H
(t), this time–step has to be much
smaller than 1/Ω2.

′

To write down the Runge–Kutta algorithm for (5) is
straightforward and the ﬁrst question we would like to
address here is: supposing that an atom is initially in
the trapped dressed state | + 2Ai, what is the probability
P2A = |h2A|Ψ(r, t)i|2 of ﬁnding it in that same state as
time goes by in diﬀerent locations of the rf trap? The
preliminary answer to this question is presented in Fig. 3
(gravity not included), where the probability we are in-
terested in is plotted for three diﬀerent values of ∆, the
diﬀerence between the radio–frequencies ω1 and ω2.

FIG. 3: (color online). Probability for an atom to remain
in the initial rf trapped state | + 2Ai. The values of ∆ are
respectively: 1.75Ω1 in (a) and (b); 2Ω1 in (c) and (d); and
2.5Ω1 in (e) and (f). The rf trap frequency ω1/2π is set to
3.19 MHz. The x-t (z-t) dependency of P2A is calculated at
zmin = −0.19 mm (xmin = 6.9 mm).

In the Fig. 3, and from now on, we use Ω1 as a fre-
quency unit, having in mind to keep it constant in a
given experimental situation. The value of Ω2 has been
taken equal to 0.05Ω1, small enough in order to be in the
perturbative limit, as it will be shown later (this value
of Ω2 will be used in all the following results except if
a diﬀerent one is explicitely stated). In the left column
of Fig. 3, the x and time dependency of P2A are calcu-

4

lated at the points y = 0 and zmin ≈ −0.19 mm, with
this value of z corresponding to the location of the left
avoided level crossing in Fig. 2(b). To obtain the right
column of ﬁgure 3, we use for x the value xmin ≈ 6.9 mm,
very close to the location where the QUIC trap has its
minimum in the x direction. It is important to mention
at this point that the values of ∆ have not been chosen
at random. Because the energy separation between the
adiabatic levels at the avoided level crossings is exactly
2Ω1, these values are associated in fact with the situa-
tions where the action of the rf ﬁeld at ω2 corresponds
to: red–detuned [Fig. 3(a) and (b)], resonant [(c) and
(d)], and blue–detuned [(e) and (f)] couplings between
the adiabatic states. Moreover, apart from the observed
modulations of P2A, essentially determined by a beating
between the ∆ and Ω(r) frequency components in Eq. (4),
there is another feature we would like to stress. Namely,
the presence of the inner resonance clearly seen in the z
dependency of P2A in Fig. 3(f). Notice that the avoided
level crossing (rf trap center) is at zmin. Looking back
to the Fig. 2 and having in mind that ω2 > ω1, the ex-
istence of this second resonance is counter–intuitive and,
as we will see, it is fully determined by the rotation angle
θ. Finally, we would like to mention that because of the
loose conﬁnement in the x direction [10], the dynamics
in the y-z plane does not change much from one location
to another in the x axis. However, this aﬃrmation is
not valid when z (or y) is changed and the dynamics is
studied along the x direction.

B.

Interpreting the numerical results using a ﬁrst

order Magnus series approximation

Searching for the understanding of the physical picture
behind the numerical results presented in Fig. 3, let’s con-
sider the ﬁrst order Magnus series approximation [23, 24]
to the solution of Eq. (5). This approximation is basi-
cally the formal solution of (5) neglecting the two–times
commutators of H
(t). In this case, the time evolution
of a given initial dressed spin state |Ψ(0)i is represented
by the rotation

|Ψ(t)i = exp(−i Ξ(t)F/~)|Ψ(0)i ,

(6)

the notation Ξ(t)F stands

for Ξθ(t)Fθ +
where
Ξ⊥θ(t)F⊥θ + ΞY (t)FY , being Ξθ(t), Ξ⊥θ(t) and ΞY (t)
a measure of the projections of the spin |Ψ(t)i preces-
sion axis onto the axes Fθ, F⊥θ, and FY , respectively
(for simplicity we will just call them projections). Tak-
ing into account the equation (4), the deﬁnition of the
exponential argument in Eq. (6) is

Using the Eqs. (8)–(10), we can compute the time
evolved dressed state (6) and ﬁnd out the probabilities
we are interested in. However, since we are dealing with
a ﬁrst order approximation, we have to be careful when
deriving some conclusions from these equations, in par-
ticular the ones concerning the time evolution. Neverthe-
less, we still can gain some physical insights from these
equations. Let’s start, for instance, by analyzing the time
evolution of the populations of the adiabatic states |0Ai
and |2Ai. These results are shown in Fig. 4, where the
points (circles) represent the exact numerical solution of
(5) while the solid lines correspond to the Magnus series
approximation.

FIG. 4: (color online). Occupation probability of the dressed
states |2Ai (black upper traces) and |0Ai (blue lower traces)
(a). In (b) the probability for an atom to be in the untrapped
dressed states is shown. The calculation has been done at
the rf trap bottom (xmin, 0, zmin) for ∆ = 2.1Ω1 and Ω2 =
0.05Ω1.

As it can be seen in Fig. 4, if we constraint the dressed
spin dynamics to half of the ﬁrst period, we obtain a
very good agreement between the ﬁrst order Magnus se-
ries and the exact numerical results. After that instant of
time we see dephasing between the two evolutions and,
even more dramatic, an important disagreement in the
amplitude of the observed oscillations. These two be-
haviours are somehow expected because at time instants
very far from t = 0 the contribution of the next order
terms in the Magnus series becomes more relevant [24].

Let’s now recall some of the results of Sec. II A. We
know that the adiabatic states are eigenstates of HA.
This means that, at a given location r in the rf trap,
the dressed state spin is aligned with the axis Fθ, for
Ω2 = 0. Therefore, in order to consider the transitions
between dressed states when Ω2 6= 0 we can just analyze
the projection of the spin precession axis onto the F⊥θ
and FY axes. In other words, if at a given time instant
t the precession axis of |Ψ(t)i has zero projection onto
Fθ, then this wave vector will be orthogonal to the initial
adiabatic state and consequently, a transition has taken
place. In this context, if |Ψ(t)i adiabatically follows its
precession axis, then Eq. (8) suggests us that it is enough
to apply the second rf ﬁeld during π/∆ if we want to
remove the rf–trapped atoms at the locations r0 where
ω2 resonantly couples the adiabatic states. As we will
see later, the duration of such a pulse is controlled by Ω2
rather than ∆, the discrepancy arising from the fact that
a ﬁrst order Magnus approximation has been used.

Even though τ = π/∆ is not exactly the character-
istic time needed to achieve the desired spin ﬂip, there
is another useful information that can be extracted us-
ing this value. By plugging τ in (8)-(10), we ﬁnd out
that the projections Ξ⊥θ(τ ) and ΞY (τ ) are resonantly
enhanced at the locations r0 where ∆2 − Ω2(r0) = 0.
This equality already gives an indication about the po-
sitions where the resonances in Fig. 2(b) should appear.
And in fact, solving this equation for ∆ and Ω(r0), we do
indeed see the z inner resonances we mentioned before,
and shown in Fig. 5(d). On the other hand, we can see
in Eqs. (9) and (10) the time–dependent terms resulting
from a beating between frequency components at ∆ and
Ω(r). These beats produce the modulation (interference–
like patterns) of P2A observed in Fig. 3.

Another test for the validity range of the ﬁrst order
Magnus series approximation is presented in Fig. 5, where
the population of the dressed state |2Ai and the probabil-
ity of leaving the rf trap are shown. Again in this ﬁgure
the results of the numerical treatment and those from
the Magnus series are represented by the points and the
solid lines, respectively. To obtain the results in Fig. 5,
the initial adiabatic spin state have been evolved dur-
ing a time interval equal to one half of the oscillation
period observed in Fig. 4, in short, up to 2Ω1t = 20π.

Besides the good agreement that both methods show in
the regions of less interest for us, we can notice the four
resonances in the z dependencies. The inner peaks are
comparable smaller than the outer ones, indicating that
we have a position–dependent resonant coupling.

From the previous discussion it seems to be clear that
the radio–frequency conﬁned atoms can be evaporated
out of the adiabatic trap by controlling the projection
of their spin precession axis onto Fθ. It has been shown
that this process is position–sensitive by ﬁnding out the
equation that tells us the positions r0 where it happens.
However, the period T of the oscillations in Fig. 4 cannot
be easily calculated from Eqs. (8)-(10). In fact, it will be
necessary to write down the explicit form of the rotation
matrix in (6) and the obtained expressions are so com-
plex that they do not shine any light on an analytical
expression or numerical value of T .

ability for an atom to be in the untrapped dressed states is
shown in (b) for the x and in (d) for the z spatial dependen-
cies. As before, ∆ = 2.1Ω1 and Ω2 = 0.05Ω1. The inset shows
a zoom of the resonances around the avoided level crossing at
zmin ≈ −0.19 mm.

To tackle this problem, we used a diﬀerent approach
to derive more suggestive analytical expressions. This
approach is based on a second rotating wave approxima-
tion, performed on Eq. (5) and expressed through the
transformation R∆ = exp(i∆tFθ/~). This transforma-
tion R∆ leads to the time–dependent Hamiltonian H(t)
given by

H(t) = −

∆ − Ω − 2Ω2 sin(θ) cos(∆t)
(cid:3)

where all the parameters appearing in it have already
been introduced. But before continuing the discussion,
let’s quickly analyze Eq. (11). Firstly, note that this
equation is valid for any value of ∆, including those close
to Ω1, i.e., when ω1 and ω2 are not so diﬀerent from each
other. The second point that one can remark, in this new
representation, is that a dressed spin which dynamics is
governed by H(t) will have a precession axis oscillating
at 2Ω2. The spin itself precesses around this axis at a
frequency on the order of ∆ and consequently, if ∆ ≫
2Ω2 then we will be in a situation of adiabatic following.
Since the results presented until now were obtained with
∆ at least one order of magnitude greater than 2Ω2, we
can assume the adiabatic following to be valid and derive
from Eq. (11) the time–averaged Hamiltonian

in Eq. (A7).
If we look, for instance, at the vectorial
version of the adiabatic potential conﬁnement (Fig. 1),
then in the presence of the second rf ﬁeld one gets the
picture shown in Fig. 6, where now Fθ∆ plays a similar
role as Fθ. On the other hand, the period of the Rabi
oscillations induced by the coupling in (12) is clearly T =
2π/Ω2

.

(cid:2)

Another interesting point is that, independently of the
orientation of the dc magnetic ﬁeld, the coupling with
Rabi frequency Ω2 in (12) is inhomogeneous because θ
depends on r. Equivalently to the spin–ﬂip angle θ, we
can deﬁne the angle θ∆ by

1 + cos(θ)

tan(θ∆) ≡ −

F⊥θ .

(12)

(cid:2)
The Eq. (12) provides a new compact and powerful
description of the rf–evaporation process in a rf trap and
in fact, its form is completely equivalent to that of HA

1 + cos(θ)
(cid:3)

which allows us to easily derive an expression for the
strength and location of the resonances shown in Fig. 3.
Let’s begin, for instance, by ﬁnding out the position of
the resonances. On one hand, by just looking at Fig. (6)
we can realize that θ∆ = π/2 corresponds to maximum

the parameter range we have explored. Notice that for
∆ ≫ Ω1 we recover the expected result that only the
resonance, between the bare states, at ω2 occurs.

transition probability to a state orthogonal to the eigen-
states of Fθ. On the other hand, using the deﬁnition of θ
(section II A) we can write Ω as 2Ω1/ sin(θ) and redeﬁne
(13) as

tan(θ∆) = −

1 + cos(θ)
Ω2
(cid:3)
(cid:2)
∆ − 2Ω1/ sin(θ)

,

(14)

from which it is relatively easy to see that the reso-
nances are located at the points where θ is such that
the denominator of Eq. (14) is zero. These values are
θ0 = arcsin(2Ω1/∆) and π − θ0 = arcsin(2Ω1/∆). Now,
recalling that when θ = π/2 we are exactly at the avoided
level crossings in Fig. 2(b), θ0 indicates the location of
the outer resonances while π − θ0 takes care of the inner
ones. So, we recover again with this diﬀerent approach,
based on adiabatic following, the presence of the counter–
intuitive resonances.

In what concerns the strength of the resonances, it can
be considered through the ratio of the couplings at the
inner and outer resonances. From Eq. (12) this ratio is
and it is plotted in
given by
Fig. 7. The calculation of the coupling ratio using the
numerical results is done as follows. For a given value of
∆ a ﬁgure similar to Fig. 5(d) is plotted. Then, the ratio
of the inner peak height to the outer peak height is found.
This is the coupling strength ratio we are interested in.
Since there is an excellent agreement between the exact
solution and the solid line in Fig. 7, we can state that
indeed the adiabatic following assumption is correct in

compared to Ω1, the coupling at the inner resonances goes
to zero. No ﬁtting parameter has been used and the excel-
lent agreement conﬁrms the validity of the adiabatic following
assumption.

So far we have successfully used the adiabatic fol-
lowing assumption. Nevertheless, the adiabatic follow-
ing condition has not yet been formulated mathemati-
cally and this is what we will do now. In analogy with
HA, the Hamiltonian (12) can be written in terms of
Fθ∆ = cos(θ∆)Fθ + sin(θ∆)F⊥θ as

The right–hand member of the inequality (16) is just

levels.

D. Evaporative cooling

When considering the evaporative cooling produced by
the second rf ﬁeld, we will constraint the study to one
dimension only, along the z direction. Our main reason
for this simpliﬁcation is the fact that the conﬁnement
obtained along z is the strongest one in our particular
experimental conditions.

Let’s assume that the atoms have enough energy to
reach the positions where the resonances are. Then, we

would like those atoms to be adiabatically evaporated out
of our rf trap and therefore, their spin have to satisfy the
adiabatic following condition. To make the link between
this condition and the external degrees of freedom, the
Eq. (16) can be used to derive the Landau–Zener param-
eter characterizing the adiabaticity of the transitions at
the resonance locations. In this case, we use the deﬁni-
tion (14) of θ∆ in order to compute its time derivative
assuming that only θ is time–dependent. Calculating the
time derivative and evaluating (16) at the resonance lo-
cation θ0, we ﬁnd that in terms of the Landau–Zener
parameter Λ the adiabatic following condition reads

Ω2
2

Λ =

(17)

≫ 1 ,

1 + cos(θ0)
(cid:2)
(cid:3)
| ˙δ0| cos(θ0)
where ˙δ0 is the time derivative of the detuning δ(r) eval-
uated at θ0, and is proportional to the atoms velocity.
From the expression of Λ we can see that as soon as Ω2
is reduced, only the slow atoms will have their spin adi-
abatically following the axis Fθ∆. Therefore, in order for
the evaporation to work the atoms energy has to be large
enough so that they will be able to reach the resonance.
But, at the same time, this energy has to be small enough
so that Eq. (17) is satisﬁed.

The energy constraints imposed by the rf trapping po-
tential and by the rf ﬁeld for the evaporation can also be
analyzed using the distance between the evaporation res-
onances. We already know that there are two resonances
around each avoided level crossing in the z direction. In
Fig. (8) we investigate the distance ∆zRes between the
neighbouring inner and outer resonances as a function
of ∆. As expected, the distance between the resonances
goes to zero when ∆ is reduced. Consequently, the pa-
rameter ∆zRes gives an indication of the maximum cloud
size in the z direction and it can be used for ﬁnding out
the maximal possible temperature of the atoms, in other
words, the rf trap depth set by ∆.

In Fig. 9, the dependency of the trap depth with ∆,
in the 1D harmonic oscillator approximation, is plotted.
We check the validity of this approximation by ﬁtting
the adiabatic potential of the dressed state |2Ai with
a parabola. As it can be seen in the Fig. 9 inset, the
parabola (red curve) ﬁts very well the adiabatic poten-
tial (blue curve) in the region between the black vertical
lines. This agreement allows us to write the trap depth
z(∆zRes)2/kB, being M the 87Rb atomic mass,
as: M ω2
ωz (taken equal to 2π 500 Hz) the oscillation frequency
in the z direction and kB the Boltzmann constant.

The trap depth range covered in Fig. 9 corresponds
to relatively low temperatures, i.e., to the end of the
evaporation process.

E. Strategy for implementing the evaporative
cooling in the rf trap

1. Geometry of the evaporative cooling rf source

In the theoretical treatment presented so far, we con-
sider that the rf ﬁeld used for the evaporation is polarized
in the same direction as the ﬁeld used to produce the
radio–frequency conﬁnement. The reason for choosing
this conﬁguration is the following. When both ﬁelds have
the same frequency (∆ = 0), the ﬁeld used for the trap-
ping will just have its power enhanced by the contribution
of the second rf source. Therefore, one could expect the

adiabatic trapping potential to be generated with just
more rf power, if the two ﬁelds are phase–coherent and
Ω1 ≫ Ω2.

Let’s now consider another situation. Suppose that we
have only one rf source, the one employed to generate
the rf trap. And, suppose further that this rf source
is somehow contaminated by stray ﬁelds and therefore
is not perfectly monochromatic: we have a carrier that
cannot be described by a delta function but it has a ﬁnite
width. Then it is clear that if the frequency components
next to the carrier are in the range of, let’s say, ∆ =
2.01Ω1 – 2.1Ω1, they will empty the rf trap if they have
power enough to do so or, in the best case, they will
rise the temperature of the atoms. The reason is that
this range of values of ∆ (a few hundreds of Hz up to a
few kHz) corresponds to the typical trapping oscillation
frequencies in highly anisotropic traps. So, looking at
the second rf source as a noise term (a sideband in the
frequency spectrum), the results presented here can be
used to estimate the damage it causes.

The last points we would like to consider here concerns
the inner resonance observed in the z directions. One
positive aspect about those resonances is that when ∆
is such that they are close to the avoided level crossing
location, the atomic cloud trapped in the adiabatic state
|2Ai can be evaporated from both sides. The negative
point is that some atoms are transferred by the inner
resonance into the state | − 2Ai and trapped close to
z = 0. If these atoms are able to come back to the region
of the avoided level crossing, then they will be energetic
enough that heating of the coldest atoms will take place
via inter–atomic collisions.

2. Population modulation

We have seen in Figs. 3(a), (b), (e) and (f) that even
when the detuning for coupling adiabatic states is red or
blue (∆ < 2Ω1 or ∆ > 2Ω1), the population of the initial
trapped dressed state |2Ai is modulated at the center
of the rf trap (avoided level crossing). Such a modu-
lation can produce unwanted heating or losses and, to
study this process, we introduced the modulation depth.
This quantity is deﬁned as the contrast of the oscillations
represented in Fig. 4(a) by the black points (numerical
result). In Fig. 10 we plotted the modulation depth as
a function of the Rabi frequency of the evaporation rf
ﬁeld, and for two diﬀerent values of ∆. As expected,
the modulation depth increases with Ω2 since larger rf
power is available for coupling the adiabatic states. Also
not very surprising, this modulation is more pronounced
when ∆ is such that ω2 couples adiabatic states close to
the position of the avoided level crossing.

Taking into account the result presented in Fig. 10, we
devised one possible strategy in order to aﬀect as less as
possible the coldest atoms, while doing the evaporation.
The idea is to ramp ∆ and Ω2 simultaneously to preserve
a ﬁxed modulation depth at the rf trap center. In Fig. 11

such a ramp is presented, where we have allowed for a 3%
modulation level of the coldest atoms population.

In fact, since Ω2 and ∆ can be controlled indepen-
dently, we can make individual ramps for each one of
these parameters and manipulate independently the po-
sition and strength of the evaporation resonances. Tak-
ing into account that there is a ﬁnite modulation of the
atomic population at the rf trap center, even for ∆ very
diﬀerent from Ω1, we propose to use a limited number of
rf pulses to cool down the sample. A similar pulsed evap-
orative cooling scheme has been developed to achieve the
quantum degeneracy of a beam of neutral atoms [25].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

which in the frame rotating at the frequency ω1 becomes

In contrast with the traditional continuous forced evap-
oration scheme used in static magnetic traps, the idea of
evaporative cooling in rf traps developed in this work is
based on the application of rf pulses with properly chosen
durations and frequencies. The duration of such pulses
is essentially determined by the power of the rf ﬁeld used
for the evaporation, although the optimal pulse length
changes from one location to another in the adiabatic
trapping potential. When the trapping and evaporative
cooling radio–frequencies are comparable, we found the
evaporation to happen also via intuitively unexpected
resonances. Even if the possibility of having these reso-
nances can enhance the evaporation process, we have to
be careful with the modulation (losses, heating) of the
population of the coldest atoms. Such a modulation is
generated by the beating between the two rf ﬁelds dress-
ing the atomic system.

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF H(r, t)

We will start the derivation of Eq. (1) by considering
that the total magnetic ﬁeld experienced by the atoms
consists of three contributions or terms. One coming
from the inhomogeneous dc magnetic ﬁeld Bdc(r) of the
QUIC trap, a second term oscillating at the frequency
ω1, B1(r, t) = B01e1 cos(ω1t), associated with the adia-
batic trapping potential, and a third term of frequency
ω2, B2(r, t) = B02e2 cos(ω2t), responsible for the evap-
orative cooling in the rf trap. Here, B01 and B02 are
the amplitudes of the ﬁelds whereas e1 and e2 are unit
polarization vectors. Using these deﬁnitions and denot-
ing by F the atomic angular momentum operator, the
total Hamiltonian of our physical system HT (r, t) can be
approximated by

HT (r, t) = gF µBF
(cid:2)

Bdc(r) + B1(r, t) + B2(r, t)
(cid:3)

(A1)
where gF and µB are the Land´e factor and the Bohr
magneton, respectively. If we assume that at every point
r the direction of the dc magnetic ﬁeld deﬁnes the local
Z quantization axis then, for X polarized rf ﬁelds, the
Eq. (A1) takes the form

/~ ,

HT (r, t) = ω0(r)FZ + V1(r, t) + V2(r, t) .

(A2)

In (A2) ω0(r) = gF µBBdcZ(r)/~ is the Larmor precession
frequency. The interaction Hamiltonian Vj(r, t) is deﬁned
by the expression

Vj(r, t) = 2Ωj(r)FX

j = 1, 2 (A3)

being 2Ωj(r) ≡ gF µBB0j/(2~) the Rabi frequency.

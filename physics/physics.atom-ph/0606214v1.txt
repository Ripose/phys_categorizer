The light-induced frequency shift due to the hyperpolarizability (i.e. terms of second-order in
intensity) is studied for a forbidden optical transition, J=0→J=0. A simple universal dependence
on the ﬁeld ellipticity is obtained. This result allows minimization of the second-order light shift with
respect to the ﬁeld polarization for optical lattices operating at a magic wavelength (at which the
ﬁrst-order shift vanishes). We show the possibility for the existence of a magic elliptical polarization,
for which the second-order frequency shift vanishes. The optimal polarization of the lattice ﬁeld
can be either linear, circular or magic elliptical. The obtained results could improve the accuracy
of lattice-based atomic clocks.

In recent years signiﬁcant attention has been devoted
to optical lattice atomic clocks [1, 2], in part because the
prospects for a fractional frequency uncertainty of such a
clock could achieve of the level 10−17-10−18. Apart from
obvious practical applications, such improved clocks will
be critical for a variety of terrestrial and space-borne ap-
plications including improved tests of the basic laws of
physics and searches for drifts in the fundamental con-
stants [3]. The crucial ingredient, for achieving such high
metrological performance, is the existence of the magic
wavelength λm, at which the ﬁrst-order (in intensity)
3P0 cancels for
light shift of the clock transition 1S0→
alkaline-earth-like atoms (such as Mg, Ca, Sr, Yb, Zn,
Cd). To date in several experiments cold atoms were
trapped in optical lattices at the magic wavelength and
the clock transition was observed [2, 4, 5, 6]. From the
metrological point of view even isotopes (with zero nu-
clear spin) are more attractive. To excite strictly for-
bidden clock transitions in even isotopes the method of
magnetic ﬁeld-induced spectroscopy was proposed [7] and
realized [5].

Obviously, the achievement of such an extraordinary
accuracy in frequency standards is a challenging goal.
On the way to this goal it will be necessary to use new
approaches and to solve step-by-step the critical physical
problems [2]. For example, since at the magic wavelength
λm the ﬁrst-order shift vanishes, one of the main factors
that limits the accuracy of these optical clocks is the
second-order shift due to the atomic hyperpolarizability.
Indeed, for the formation of optical lattices with the po-
tential depth of order of MHz [2, 4, 5, 6] it is necessary
to use laser beams with the intensity at a level of a few

tens of kW/cm2. According to our numerical estimates
for diﬀerent alkaline-earth-like atoms [8, 9] and ﬁrst ex-
perimental observations for Sr [6], the second-order shift
can be at a level of 1-10 Hz in such high-intensity ﬁelds.
In this case to get planned accuracy we need strictly to
control the spatially non-uniform optical lattice ﬁelds at
a level of 10−3-10−5 under conditions of strong focus-
ing, reﬂections and interference of light beams. Here
apart from long-term stabilization of the laser radiation
(power, transverse distribution of intensity) we need pre-
cision long-term stability of the whole optical system. A
signiﬁcant reduction of a lattice ﬁeld intensity is not an
eﬀective solution of the problem, because in this case
both the number and lifetime of the trapped atoms will
be reduced also.

Thus, the hyperpolarizability eﬀect on atoms in optical
lattices is an important physical problem, which needs to
be carefully studied (the papers [1, 6] have begun such
investigations).
In this context the search for alterna-
tive methods of minimization of the second-order shifts
is especially relevant.

In the present paper we study the dependence of the
second-order shift on the elliptical ﬁeld polarization for
J=0 transition. We show
the optically forbidden J=0
how to minimize this shift with respect to the ellipticity
of the lattice ﬁeld polarization. It turns out that under
certain conditions there exists a magic ellipticity at which
the second-order light shift vanishes.

It should be stressed that the qualitative analysis

contributions to hyperpolarizability from the inner-shell
electrons, nor numerous oﬀ-resonant contributions in
γ(ωm,ε) of the jumping electron. So, while there is a
good chance of a magic ellipticity for Yb, the ultimate

answer will be given by an experiment. Nevertheless, the
analysis shows that the presence of the near-resonance

ation.

maximal (see eq.(15)), while for linear polarization it

described the method for minimizing the second-order

this end, the higher-order shifts for linear and circular
ﬁeld polarization should be measured and compared.
If these shifts are the same sign, then the optimal
polarization (either circular or linear) will correspond to
minimal absolute value of the shift. If the signs of the
measured shifts are diﬀerent, then a magic ellipticity
εm will exist, where the second-order shift vanishes.
The magic ellipticity can be estimated from (11), and
determined more accurately from experiments.

It should be stressed that the existence of a magic ellip-
ticity allows a practically ideal one-dimensional standing
wave optical lattices for the frequency standards, because
in this case it is not necessary to control strictly the
lattice ﬁeld intensity. Consequently, one can use high-
intensity ﬁelds to create deep potential lattices with high

4

eﬃciency of trapping and with longer capture time. Note
also, that in deep potential lattices cold atoms are local-
ized on length scales much less than the ﬁeld wavelength,
i.e. the strong Lamb-Dicke regime is realized.

These results can be extended to 2D and 3D lattices
in the ﬁeld with spatially non-uniform polarization [14].
Here the lattice ﬁeld conﬁguration should be chosen in
such a way that at the potential energy minimum the
local ﬁeld polarization coincides with the optimal value
(either linear, circular or magic) for the given element.
In this case for lower vibrational levels the second-order
shifts will be minimal, assuming the Lamb-Dicke regime.

Relativistic third-order MBPT is applied to obtain energies of ions with two valence electrons
in the no virtual-pair approximation (NVPA). A total of 302 third-order Goldstone diagrams are
organized into 12 one-body and 23 two-body terms. Only third-order two-body terms and diagrams
are presented here, owing to the fact that the one-body terms are identical to the previously studied
third-order terms in monovalent ions. Dominant classes of diagrams are identiﬁed. The model
potential is a Dirac-Hartree-Fock V N−2 potential, and B-spline basis functions in a cavity of ﬁnite
radius are employed in the numerical calculations. The Breit interaction is taken into account
through second order of perturbation theory and the lowest-order Lamb shift is also evaluated.
Sample calculations are performed for berylliumlike ions with Z = 4–7, and for the magnesiumlike
ion P IV. The third-order energies are in excellent agreement with measurement with an accuracy
at 0.2% level for the cases considered. Comparisons are made with previous second-order MBPT
results and with other calculations. The third-order energy correction is shown to be signiﬁcant,
improving second-order correlation energies by an order of magnitude.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The development of relativistic MBPT in recent
decades has been motivated in part by the need for ac-
curate theoretical amplitudes of parity non-conserving
(PNC) transitions in heavy monovalent atoms such as
cesium and francium. Applications of the theoretical
methods developed to treat atomic PNC include support
of atomic clock development, tests of QED in precision
spectroscopy of highly-stripped ions, searches for time
variation in the ﬁne-structure constant, and providing
precise astrophysical data.

Although nonrelativistic studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
and relativistic HF calculations [8, 9, 10] for divalent
atoms and ions have been done for many years, only re-
cently have relativistic many-body calculations been re-
ported. As examples, we note that all-order relativistic
MBPT calculations for transitions in berylliumlike ions
with Z = 26 and 42 were carried out by Lindroth and
Hvarfner [11], while large-scale conﬁguration-interaction
(CI) calculations for transitions in C III were performed

by Chen et al. [12]. Relativistic many-body calculations
for magnesiumlike ions include the CI calculations of
states in the n = 3 complex by Chen and Cheng [13],
and mixed CI-MBPT calculations of excitation energies
in neutral Mg by Savukov and Johnson [14].

Second-order relativistic MBPT was applied to Be-like
ions by Safronova et al. [15] and energies were found to
be accurate at the 2% level. In this paper, we extend rel-
ativistic MBPT for divalent atoms and ions to third or-
der. We give a detailed treatment of the two-body terms
here; the one-body terms are identical to those for mono-
valent systems and are discussed in detail by Blundell
et al. [16]. The long-range goal of the present research is
to extend the relativistic singles-doubles coupled-cluster
(SDCC) formalism to atoms and ions with two valence
electrons. The present calculations permit us to identify
and evaluate those third-order terms missing from the
SDCC expansion.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

for our MBPT calculation is
The model potential
the Dirac-Hartree-Fock V N
2 potential. The Dirac-
Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian for an N -electron atom is
H = H0 + V , where

conﬁguration-weight vector. For simplicity, matrix ele-
ments of the eﬀective Hamiltonian are given for the un-
coupled states, |vwi ≡ a†va†w |0i and |v′w′i. In third or-
der, each element consists of 12 one-body and 23 two-
body terms. They represent a total of 84 one-body and
218 two-body Goldstone diagrams. The multiplications
of Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients and the summations over
magnetic quantum numbers are carried out during angu-
lar decomposition. Only the two-body part of the third
order is discussed here as the one-body part and complete
second-order results are already presented in Refs. [16]

and the Dirac Hamiltonian is

hD = cα·p + βc2 + Vnuc(r),

where Vnuc is obtained assuming a Fermi nuclear charge
distribution. All equations are in atomic units. The per-
turbation is

In the no virtual-pair approximation, the excitations are
limited to positive-energy eigenstates of H. [17, 18, 19,
20]

The eigenstates of a divalent system having angular

momentum (J, M ) are described by the coupled states

ΦJM (vw) = ηvw

where |0i represents the ground state of the ionic core
and ηvw is the normalization constant

for v 6= w
for v = w .

Here v and w specify the corresponding one-electron
states with quantum numbers
(nv, lv, jv, mv) and
(nw, lw, jw, mw). The model space P is deﬁned by the set
of total angular-momentum states (1); the model-space
projection operator is

P =

|ΦJM (vw)i hΦJM (vw)| .

XJM

(v≤w)

The orthogonal-space operator Q is simply 1−P.

The wave operator Ω is found by solving the general-

ized Bloch equation [21]

[Ω, H0] P = (V Ω − ΩPV Ω)P.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian is given in terms of the wave
operator

Heﬀ = P H0P + P V ΩP.

A. Eﬀective Hamiltonian

We ﬁrst ﬁnd the conﬁguration-weight vector by di-
agonalizing the Hamiltonian H = H (0)
eﬀ us-
ing total angular-momentum eigenstates (1) as basis.
Higher-order energies are obtained by operating the ef-
fective Hamiltonian of the corresponding order on the

eﬀ + H (1)

and [15].

and ˜gijkl ≡ gijkl − gijlk. The notation εijkl ≡ εi + εj +
εk + εl, etc. for the sum of single-electron eigenenergies
has also been used. The third-order terms are arranged
by the number of excited states in the sums over states.
Zero, single, double, triple, quadruple excited-state terms
are designated by the letters Z, S, D, T, Q. Terms associ-
ated with backwards (folded) diagrams are designated
by B. Backwards diagrams are unique for open-shell
systems and exist only in the third or higher order of
MBPT. The summation indices (a, b, c, d) refer to core
states, (m, n, r, s) refer to excited states and, in back-
ward diagrams, indices (x, y) refer to valence states. The
primes above the summation signs indicate that excited
states (m, n, r, s) are restricted to the orthogonal space
Q only. This restriction applies only to the term with
denominator 1/(εvw − εmn) in D2 and to the term with
denominator 1/(εvw −εmv′) in D3. The c.c. denotes com-
plex conjugate. The conjugate diagrams are obtained by
a reﬂection through a horizontal axis, with the initial
and ﬁnal states switched (vw) ↔ (v′w′). Direct dia-
grams of the two-body terms are shown in Fig. 1. Tech-
nically, there are subtle changes in energy denominators

in going from the term presented to its c.c. counterpart.
These changes can be deduced by re-drawing the diagram
upside-down and reading oﬀ the new denominators.

In D1 and D4 (but not in D2 and D3) we combined
diagrams associated with double excitations that have
the same numerators but diﬀerent denominators using
the formula

1
(A + B)A

+

1
(A + B)B

=

1
AB

.

Diagrams D1 – D4 are special in the sense that two order-
ings are possible. The ambiguous vertices are labeled by
crosses in the diagrams. Many of the third-order terms in
the two-body part have external exchanges and complex
conjugates so each diagram illustrated in Fig. 1 has from
one to eight variants. The largest fraction of computer
time is spent evaluating the term Q and most of the re-
mainder is spent on repetitive evaluation of terms Dk, Tk
and their variants. Angular decompositions of the direct
formulas are listed in the Appendix.

III. APPLICATION AND DISCUSSION

As a ﬁrst illustration, we apply the theory described
above to obtain energies of the ground state and ex-
cited states in the n = 2 complex for Be-like ions.
In
Table I, we give a detailed breakdown of the contribu-
tions from ﬁrst-, second- and third-order perturbation
theory, together with corrections from the Breit interac-
tion and from the Lamb-shift, for excitation energies of
(2s2p) 3P0,1,2 states of Be-like ions. The experimental en-
ergies are taken from the NIST database for atomic spec-
troscopy [22]. Energies E(0+1) represent the lowest-order
energies including the Breit correction. Lowest-order
Lamb shifts ELamb are obtained following the method de-
scribed in Ref. [23]. We ﬁnd that the residual diﬀerences
between calculated and measured energies ∆E decrease
rapidly with increasing Z. This is expected since MBPT
converges better for charged ions than for neutral atoms.
In fact, for highly-charged ions, correlations are expected
n, where n is the order
to decrease approximately as Z 2
of perturbation theory [24]. On the other hand, QED
eﬀects (Lamb shifts) become more important along an
isoelectronic sequence. The results in Table I, conﬁrm
both of these trends. Results of our calculations of ex-
citation energies of all levels in the n = 2 complex for
Be-like N (N IV) are presented in Table II and are seen
to be in agreement with measurement to parts in 104.

−

As a more involved example, we give a complete break-
down of contributions to energies of low-lying states in
the n = 3 complex for the Mg-like ion P IV in Table III.
For both N IV and P IV, correlations are seen to account
for about 10% of the total energies. For Be-like ions, the
third-order correlations are only 7–10% of the second-
order correlations. The second-order correlation energies
are an order of magnitude smaller than the correspond-
ing DHF energies. The Breit correction B(2), which is

obtained by linearizing the second-order matrix elements
in Breit interaction, is also small for such lightly-charged
ions.

Our calculations for Be-like ions are able to produce
1. This shows that
results accurate to order of ten cm−
the third-order energy correction is very important for
divalent ions. By comparison, the second-order results
of Safronova et al. [15] for N IV agree with experiment
1. It should be noted
at the level of a few hundred cm−
that results from the CI+MBPT method [14] mentioned
in the introduction are consistently more accurate than
the present third-order results. However, the CI+MBPT
calculations contain a free parameter in the energy de-
nominators that is adjusted to give optimized energies.
In contrast, third-order MBPT is completely ab initio.
For the C III ion, the large-scale CI calculations of Chen
et al. [12] mentioned in the introduction also give tran-

5

1

sition energies accurate to better than a hundred cm−
on average. Those large-scale CI calculations are also ab
initio and have about the same accuracy as third-order
MBPT for states in C III.

For the P IV ion, our results are in good agreement
with experiment, the average discrepancy being several
1. Chaudhuri et al. [25] employed an eﬀec-
hundred cm−
tive valence shell Hamiltonian (EVSH) to calculate en-
ergies of Mg-like ions and obtained results for P IV hav-
1, which is
ing a discrepancy of about a thousand cm−
somewhat larger, but comparable, to the accuracy of our
third-order calculations.

It is informative to analyze our results in terms of di-
agrams. The relative contributions of the third-order
two-body terms for the ground-state energy of a typi-
cal member in the Be sequence and the ion P IV are
summarized in Tables IV and V. Dominant classes of
diagrams are Q and B3. This is understandable since
Q are quadruple excited-state diagrams and involve no
core excitations. The quadruple excitation diagrams are
entirely due to valence-valence correlation eﬀects; they
are expected to be large because of the strong repulsion
of the outer valence electrons. Class B3 are backwards
diagrams, which are characteristic of open-shell systems.
As shown in Fig. 1, this class is also associated solely
with valence-valence correlation. The two classes Q and
B3 tend to cancel each other as there is an extra phase of
-1 associated with backwards diagrams. It is interesting
to note that even after subtraction of the contributions
from Q and B3, their diﬀerence is still larger than the
contribution from any other single class of diagrams for
C III.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The accuracy of third-order MBPT results is at 0.2%
level for lightly-charged ions of both Be and Mg isoelec-
tronic sequences. This level of accuracy is comparable
or superior to the two ab initio methods mentioned in
Sec. III. A complete third-order calculation is important
to understand the relative importance of diﬀerent con-
tributions to energies of divalent systems. The folded
diagrams as well as the quadruple excitation diagrams
are signiﬁcant. The dominant role of these two classes
of diagrams is attributed to the strong correlation of the
two valence electrons. This conclusion is useful for work-
ers developing combined CI-MBPT methods which in-
clude dominant third-order diagrams. It is also helpful
for researchers setting up SDCC calculations as they try
to classify and account for the contributions from the
third-order diagrams associated with omitted triple exci-
tations. Although one might expect a complete fourth-
order calculation for divalent systems to improve the ac-
curacy of the present calculations still further, it is un-
likely that such a complex calculation will be carried out
in the near future.

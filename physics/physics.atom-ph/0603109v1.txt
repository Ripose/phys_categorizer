(Dated: July 28, 2013)

Close to converged energies and expectation values for PsH are computed using a ground state
∞

wave function consisting of 1800 explicitly correlated gaussians. The best estimate of the PsH
energy was -0.789196740 hartree which is the lowest variational energy to date. The 2γ annihilation
rate for PsH

was 2.47178 × 109 s

The calculation of positronium hydride (PsH) repre-
sents one of the simplest possibilities for studying mixed
electronic and positronic systems. Since its stability was
ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1951 by Ore [1], a variety of methods
have been applied to determine its structure. These in-
clude variational calculations with Hylleraas type basis
sets [2, 3, 4, 5], variational calculations with explicitly
correlated gaussians (ECGs) [6, 7, 8, 9], quantum Monte
Carlo methods [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and most recently the
conﬁguration interaction method [15, 16, 17, 18]. The
lowest variational energy for PsH∞ prior to the present
article was that of Yan and Ho [4]. Their largest calcula-
tion gave an energy of -0.7891967051 hartree. Bubin and
Adamowicz used a 3200 dimension ECG basis to give an
energy of -0.788870707 hartree for PsH1 [19].

In this work, the stochastic variational method (SVM)
is used to construct a wave function with a lower energy
that the best wave function of Yan and Ho. Indeed, the
best SVM energy of -0.789196740 hartree is even lower
than the value estimated by Yan and Ho as the varia-
tional limit (e.g. -0.7891967147(42) hartree).

The SVM used for this work has been described in
a number of articles [20, 21, 22] and only the briefest
description is given here. The SVM expands the wave
function in a linear combination of ECGs. Such basis
functions have Hamiltonian matrix elements that can be
computed very quickly and the energy is optimized by
performing a trial and error search over the exponential
parameters that deﬁne the basis. The SVM has been used
to solve a number of many-body problems in diﬀerent
areas of physics [20, 22].

For the present set of calculations a basis containing
1800 ECGs was used for the ﬁnal calculation. All the
optimizations of the ECG basis were done with the H
mass set to ∞. The annihilation rates given in Tables I
and II are proportional to the probability of ﬁnding an
electron and a positron at the same position in a spin
singlet state according to

[7, 23, 24]. The sum is over the electron coordinates, the
δ-function expectation is evaluated in a3
0, and Γ is given

numerically in s−1. The operator OS
ip is a spin projection
operator to select spin singlet states for the ip electron-
positron pair.

Table I lists a number of expectation values obtained
from a sequence of increasingly larger calculations. The
net energy improvement when the basis was increased
from 900 to 1800 ECGS, while being subjected to addi-
tional optimization, was 1.98×10−7 hartree. It is worth
noting that the energy of the largest calculation, namely
-0.789196740 hartree, is lower than the previous best en-
ergy of Yan and Ho [4], namely -0.7891967051 hartree.
Yan and Ho examined the convergence pattern associ-
ated with their sequence of increasingly larger calcula-
tions and estimated that the true energy was actually
9.6(4.2) × 10−9 hartree lower (e.g.
-0.7891967147(42)
hartree). The present calculation indicates that the ac-
tual correction should have been more than three times
as large as that estimated by Yan and Ho. Although the
sign of size of energy correction is not large, it is apparent
that the procedure used to determine the energy correc-
tion is faulty. In Hylleraas calculations one typically does
some sort of non-linear optimization to choose the expo-
nential parameters that give the minimum energy. This
has the unintended byproduct of distorting the conver-
gence pattern of the energy and thus introducing large
uncertainties in the extrapolation of the energy [25]. This
problem is probably more widespread than just the PsH
calculation of Yan and Ho. It could occur whenever one
extrapolates a sequence of energies while using a family
of basis functions that are characterized by a parameter
which has been subjected to a non-linear optimization.
The coalescence matrix elements, hδ(e− − e−)i and
hδ(H+ − e+)i were more sensitive to the increase in ba-
sis size than any other quantity. This sensitivity is due
to the fact that the wave function amplitude between
two repelling particles is expected to be small at their
coalescence point and the ECG functional form is not
the natural choice to describe the behavior of the rel-
ative wave function for two strongly repelling particles.
With respect to the more physically interesting observ-
ables, the annihilation rate, Γ varied most as the basis
dimension was increased. But, the increase in Γ was just
larger than 0.1% when the basis was increased from 900
to 1800.

A comprehensive set of the best set of expectation val-
ues are listed in Table II. They are compared with the

results of another, but completely independent, large ba-
sis SVM calculation [9]. The expectation value for the
virial theorem hV i/hT i provides an estimate of the wave
function accuracy and the deviation of hV i/hT i from -2
was only 7.3 × 10−8 hartree.

The energies of the diﬀerent mass variants of PsH were
computed by rediagonalizing the Hamiltonian with the
same basis but with mH1 set to 1836.1527 me, mH2 set
to 3670.483 me and mH3 set to 5496.899 me. The ener-
gies of PsH1, PsH2 and PsH3 were -0.788870618 hartree,
-0.789033556 hartree and -0.789087767 hartree respec-
tively. The energy of the 3200 ECG wave function of
Bubin and Adamowicz [19] for PsH1 was -0.788870707
hartree, which is 1.0 × 10−7 hartree below the present
energy.

To summarize, a close to converged binding energy is

reported for the PsH∞ ground state. The present energy
is 2.5 × 10−8 hartree lower than the estimated variational
limit of Yan and Ho. The procedure by Yan and Ho to
estimate the variational limit probably tends to underes-
timate the size of the necessary energy correction.

Although the present energy is better than that of Yan
and Ho, this does not necessarily mean that the present
SVM annihilation rate is more accurate. Any basis of
ECGs (which cannot satisfy the exact inter-particle cusp
conditions) will have a tendency to underestimate the
electron-positron coalescence matrix element. Table I
shows a consistent increase in Γ as the size of the cal-
culation in increased.

Abstract

We study ab initio computations of the interaction of Lithium with a strong laser ﬁeld. Numerical

solutions of the time-dependent fully-correlated three-particle Schr¨odinger equation restricted to

the one-dimensional soft-core approximation are presented. Our results show a clear transition

from non-sequential to sequential double ionization for increasing intensities. Non sequential double

ionization is found to be sensitive to the spin conﬁguration of the ionized pair. This asymmetry,

also found in experiments of photoionization of Li with synchrotron radiation, shows the evidence

of the inﬂuence of the exclusion principle in the underlying rescattering mechanism.

Photoionization of atoms by short-pulsed intense laser radiation constitutes an extraor-

dinary playground to test quantum mechanics beyond the perturbative limit. The earliest

experiments on this subject already showed many new features unexplained by the standard

approaches of that time, and renewed the interest on alternative non-perturbative theoretical

developments. Among them, the ab initio numerical integration of the Schr¨odinger equation

provided a fundamental tool for the profound understanding of the dynamics of laser-matter

interaction. Always limited by the current state-of-the-art of the computing hardware, the

numerical codes ﬁrst targeted the problem of single electron ionization in one dimension

using a soft-core potential [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The reduction to 1D has been considered for

more than ten years a reasonable strategy to get a ﬁrst insight into the dynamics of intense

ﬁeld ionization. In particular, many aspects of the strong ﬁeld phenomena can be described

qualitatively at this level (among them, above threshold ionization, and the basic general

features of the harmonic spectrum). More recently, one-electron three-dimensional codes

have helped to unravel more subtile phenomena as non-dipolar eﬀects [7]. However, the

complexity of the numerical task grows exponentially with the number of particles, as new

dimensions have to be added. This introduces a rather serious technical limit to the compu-

tation of the full 3D dynamics of more than one particle. Nowadays, the exact integration

of the 3D Schr¨odinger equation can be accomplished only for the case of He interacting with

linearly polarized electromagnetic ﬁelds, employing a extraordinary amount of computing

resources [8, 9].

In these circumstances, the dimensional reduction of the many-particle

problem continues as a fundamental tool. For instance, the 1D approach to the laser-He

interaction [5, 6] is still employed as the most common technique to tackle the two-particle

problem. For three electron problem, the dimensional reduction appears almost mandatory.

Note that other traditional approaches (density functional theories) have not straightfor-

ward applications in the limit of small number of particles [10], which are highly correlated.

Quantum correlations, therefore, play a fundamental role in the dynamics of few particles.

The advantage of the dimensional reduction is to allow ab initio numerical calculations that

include completely these correlations.

Accordingly to the underlying mechanism, the double photoionization of Helium can be

cataloged as sequential or non sequential. In the ﬁrst case, both electrons ionized indepen-

dently by photon absorption from the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In contrast, the non-sequential

ionization reveals a more subtile dynamics, in which the second electron is ionized via scat-

2

tering with the ﬁrst [11, 12, 13]. One signature of the relevance of quantum correlation in

this later process consists in the sensitivity to the particular form of entanglement of the

ionizing pair. As reported in [14, 15, 16], the rescattering process is less eﬀective when the

two-electron wavefunction is antisymmetrized in the orbital part (orthoHelium) rather than

in the spin part (paraHelium).

In the three particle problem, i.e. Lithium, correlations

appear more intrincated involving non-separable orbital and spin antisymmetries. Exper-

imental works on the double and triple ionization in Lithium has been published recently

for synchrotron radiation and ion or electron collision [17, 18, 19, 20]. On the other hand,

previous theoretical treatments include the high photon energy limit [22], approximated

half-collision models [24, 25] and, very recently, close-coupling grid calculations in the weak

ﬁeld limit [26].

To our knowledge, the problem of Li photoionization in strong laser ﬁelds using ab initio

numerical calculations of the three-particle problem has not been previously addressed. Of

course, the full 3D problem falls well beyond present and near future computing capabilities.

However, the problem in reduced dimensionality (1D for each particle) can be addressed with

a medium-size computer. We, therefore, present in this paper the ﬁrst results of this type

of calculations that consider fully correlated electrons.

In the limit of very high photon energies, ”shake oﬀ” has been determined to be the

main mechanism for double and triple ionization of Lithium [19, 22]. However, in the case

of photon energies below some hundreds of eV, a diﬀerent mechanism has been proposed

[20, 23, 24]. In this case the electromagnetic ﬁeld ionizes one or two electrons from the inner

K-shell which, in the way out, ionize one of the remaining electrons. This viewpoint seems to

be conﬁrmed experimentally by Wehlitz et al [17], with synchrotron radiation. In addition,

the same experiment suggests through the comparison with photoionization of He, that the

double ionization of Li is not equally eﬃcient for the diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations of the

ionized pair of electrons. The present study conﬁrms this aspect and gives a fundamental

description in terms of the inhibition of e− → 2e− scattering due to the Pauli’s exclusion

principle. As stated previously [14, 16], the symmetric character of the spatial wavefunction

with respect to exchange of particles, can inhibit non-sequential double ionization.

We construct the three-particle hamiltonian in reduced dimensionality by extension of

(1)

where a and b are the parameters of the soft potential. This form of hamiltonian commutes

with the symmetry operators and, therefore, the symmetry of the wavefunction remains as
a constant of motion. Initially, we will assume the atom in its ground state 2S1/2, therefore

the wavefunction at any time has this symmetry and may be expressed as

Φααβ(z1, z2, z3, t) ∝ α(1)α(2)β(3)φ12(z1, z2, z3, t)

+ α(1)β(2)α(3)φ13(z1, z2, z3, t)

+ β(1)α(2)α(3)φ23(z1, z2, z3, t)

(2)

The spin part is the combination of three single electron spin functions, in our case α(i) ≡

| ↓i and β(i) ≡ | ↑i. The orbital functions φij(z1, z2, z3, t) are antisymmetric under the

permutation i ↔ j. Note that we have written (2) in such a way that the diﬀerent terms

in the summation have orthogonal spin states. This form is particularly useful with the

non-relativistic hamiltonian (1) since the spin state is a constant of motion and, therefore,

every term in the summation evolves independently from the others. Moreover, it will be

only necessary to compute the time evolution of one of them, since the others can be found

by simple permutations.

The ground state of our model hamiltonian is computed using imaginary-time evolution

with an initial trial function for φij(z1, z2, z3, t = 0) with the required symmetry. The soft

core potentials parameters were used to ﬁt the energy of the ground state to the experimental
value E = −7.33 a.u. (199.44 eV), i.e. a = b = 0.4969 (0.262 ˚A) Once the ground state with

the required accuracy is found, we propagate it in time according to the minimal coupling

Hamiltonian:

i∂
∂t

Φααβ(z1, z2, z3, t) = [H0 + (p1 + p2 + p3)A(t)/c] Φααβ(z1, z2, z3, t)

(3)

The vector potential A(t) is assumed to be linearly polarized along the dimension described
in the model (as usual, the A2(t) term of the interaction hamiltonian has been factorized

as a global phase). As is standard in the Helium case [5], the ionization yield is computed

4

using a partition of the Hilbert space. The extension to the Lithium case reads as:

if |z1| < 15 a.u. and |z2| < 15 a.u. and |z3| < 15 a.u.

Li
Li+
if |zi| > 15 a.u. and |zj| < 15 a.u. and |zk| < 15 a.u.
Li2+ if |zi| > 15 a.u. and |zj| > 15 a.u. and |zk| < 15 a .u.
Li3+ elsewhere

with i, j, k = 1, 2, 3

The total ionization yield is obtained by adding the contributions of each of the three

terms in eq. (2), which describe orthogonal spin conﬁgurations. Inspired by the synchrotron

experiments, we present calculations of the ionization of one-dimensional Li with a pulse
(82.06 eV) and intensities ranging from I = 10−3 a.u.
of frequency of ω = 3.016 a.u.
(3.5 × 1013 W/cm2) up to I = 10 a.u. (3.5 × 1017 W/cm2). High power coherent radiation

in this wavelengths are expected to be available at the end of this year in phase 2 of the

FEL- TTF at Hasylab (Hamburg). To achieve the relevant intensities used in this paper,

a slight focussing would be needed to focal spots of the order of 10µm. The length of the

pulse duration (four cycles) is limited by our computer’s capabilities. Larger pulse durations

are expected to increase the ionization yield, but not to alter the fundamental mechanism.

Note that, specially in the case of shorter pulses, the computations have to be carried out

over a time interval large enough to allow the ionized population to drift into the proper

spatial regions (4). This interval is typically larger than the pulse length and is determined

according to the saturation of the ionization yields (see for instance Fig. 2a).

Figure 1 shows the ratio of double to single ionization yields for diﬀerent intensities,

computed at about eight laser periods after the end of the interaction. As well established in

the photoionization of Helium, the change in the slope of this ratio as the intensity increases

(often referred as knee) is the signature of the transition from non-sequential to sequential

double ionization. Hence, this ﬁgure demonstrates, that double ionization of Lithium also

shifts from non-sequential to sequential as the intensity increases. In our particular case,
we may take Ith = 1015 W/cm2 as the threshold value between these two mechanisms.

However, in contrast with the Helium case, in Lithium there are two possible channels of

correlated double ionization. They correspond to the two diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations of the

ionized pair: parallel (αα) or antiparallel (αβ). Note that the wavefunctions φij(z1, z2, z3)

correspond to a deﬁnite spin orientation in every coordinate. Therefore, a further partition of

the spatial volume corresponding to double ionization permits us to track this two channels

5

separately. For instance, in the particular case of φ12(z1, z2, z3) , the volumes |z1| < 15 a.u.,

|z2| > 15 a.u., |z3| > 15 a.u., and |z1| > 15 a.u., |z2| < 15 a.u., |z3| > 15 a.u. describe

double ionization of an entangled pair with antiparallel spins, while |z1| > 15 a.u., |z2| > 15

a.u., |z3| < 15 a.u. describes the parallel conﬁguration. Figure 2a shows the dynamics

of double ionization in each of these two channels, as a function of time at diﬀerent laser

intensities. As noted before, the ionized population takes some time to access the spatial

regions where it is computed. This can be seen in the ﬁgure as the ionization yield stabilizes

at times larger than the interaction.

It becomes also apparent the diﬀerent dynamics of

ionization for each spin conﬁguration at intensities below the threshold Ith, i.e. when non-

sequential ionization is the relevant mechanism. On the contrary, both channels tend to

be equally possible when the ionization is sequential. In conclusion, ionization of electron

pairs with antiparallel conﬁguration is shown to be more probable when non-sequential

ionization takes place. Figure 2b plots the relative diﬀerence of the ionization yields at the

end of the computation (ﬁnal points in Fig. 2a), which is tipically above 50% in the non

sequential case. This result is in clear agreement with the indication in [17], in the sense

that comparison of their experimental results with the ionization of Helium would suggest

such asymmetry. On the other hand, our previous work in ionization of Helium has shown

that the e− → 2e− scattering process is greatly inhibited for the orthohelium case, since the

parallel spin conﬁguration implies the antisymmetric character of the orbital wavefunction,

in which Pauli’s principle reduces the strength of electron-electron interaction [14]. Figure

3 demonstrates that this also the case in the double ionization in Li. It shows the density

distribution corresponding to the term α(1)α(2)β(3)φ12(z1, z2, z3, t) in (2) at the end of the

computation at the planes z1 = 0, z2 = 0 and z3 = 0. To improve legibility, black lines outline
the limits between the regions corresponding to the neutral Li, Li+ and Li2+. As discussed

previously, the double ionization is represented by the out-of-axis regions. In this particular

case, the vertical planes correspond to double ionization of a electron pair with antiparallel

spins, while the horizontal corresponds to the parallel conﬁguration. The inhibition of this

later case is, therefore, apparent from this plot. Therefore, and in agreement with [17], the

dominant mechanism of non-sequential double ionization of Lithium at these frequencies

consists in a ﬁrst release of an electron, followed almost instantaneously by the scattering

with one of the two remaining electrons. The exclusion principle makes this scattering most

eﬀective for the antiparallel spin conﬁguration, hence resulting in a larger ionization yield.

In conclusion, we have presented ab initio results for the interaction of Lithium with a

strong laser ﬁeld, in a reduced geometry. The model, that has been proven to give deep

qualitative insight on this process for the simplest atoms (Hydrogen and Helium), is devel-

oped taking into account the three interacting electrons on equal footing with the proper

symmetrization of the wavefunction, and including full account of quantum correlations.

Our results reveal the asymmetry of the non-sequential double ionization process in relation

with the spin conﬁguration of the entangled ionized pair. We give fundamental insights of

this phenomena, based in the sensitivity of the electron rescattering to the symmetry of the

orbital wavefunction.

the total ionization yield as a function of the intensity. The ”knee” structure below the I = 1015

W/cm2. Population in the vertical planes outside the fringes at 15 a.u. (7.9 ˚A ) corresponds to

double ionization with antiparallel spin electrons (| ↑↓i ). The population in the horizontal plane

outside the fringes at 15 a.u. corresponds to double ionization with parallel spin electrons (| ↑↑i ).

Pauli principle inhibits double ionization at the z1 = z2 plane, because of the antisymmetry of the

wavefunction.

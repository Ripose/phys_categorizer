The nondipole parameters that characterize the angular disribution of the photoelectrons from
the 3d subshell of Cs are found to be altered qualitatively by the inclusion of correlation in the
form of interchannel coupling between the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 photoionization channels. A prominent
characteristic maximum is predicted only in the parameters for 3d5/2 photoionization, while the
eﬀect for 3d3/2 is rather weak. The results are obtained within the framework of the Generalized
Random Phase Approximation with Exchange (GRPAE), which in addition to the RPAE eﬀects
takes into account the rearrangement of all atomic electrons due to the creation of a 3d vacancy.

Nondipole eﬀects in the photoionization of atoms and
molecules were thought to be of any importance only
at multi-keV photon energies[1, 2] despite indications to
the contrary[3, 4, 5]. However, in an upsurge of work
on the subject, it was found both theoretically and ex-
perimentally that nondipole eﬀects are often of signiﬁ-
cance at photon energies of hundreds and even tens of
eV[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
It has been
determined that photoelectron angular distributions are
particularly aﬀected by these nondipole photoionization
channels.
In lowest order, the eﬀect of the non-dipole
channels is to add two new terms to the well-known
dipole expression for the photoelectron angular distri-
bution, along with their associated dynamical parame-
ters, γ and δ, the nondipole parameters[5, 7, 8, 17, 18].
These parameters arise from the interference of dipole
and quadrupole (E1 and E2) channels in much the same
manner that the β parameter, which characterizes the
dipole photoelectron angular distribution, arises from
dipole-dipole interference[19].

Studies of these nondipole parameters have found γ
and δ to be essentially structureless, except in regions
of dipole or quadrupole resonances[11, 16] or Cooper
minima[13].
It has also been averred that correlation
eﬀects are unimportant for nondipole eﬀects[20]. In this
communication, we show that assertion to be incorrect.
In fact, we report on a new phenomenon, a new kind of
structure in nondipole parameters that has nothing to
do with resonances or Cooper minima. This structure,
as shall be shown below, is due solely to many-body cor-
relations; it has no analogue in a single-particle picture.
Furthermore, the structure is induced by relativistic in-
teractions; it does not arise in a non-relativistic calcula-
tion. Thus, the study of this structure is a direct measure
of relativistic correlation eﬀects.

To understand the basic origin of this structure, note

that it was demonstrated recently[21] that the interac-
tion between photoionization channels belonging to dif-
ferent components of the spin-orbit doublets 3d3/2 and
3d5/2 in Xe, Cs and Ba aﬀect dramatically the partial
photoionization cross sections. Speciﬁcally, it was shown
that due to this interchannel coupling interaction, the
partial 3d5/2 cross section acquires an additional promi-
nent maximum. This result gave the explanation for the
recent experimental observation of this eﬀect in Xe[22]
and also predicted similar, even more dramatic eﬀects
for 3d photoionization in Cs and Ba.

In this communication we present the results of our
studies, based on the approach developed earlier[21], of
the nondipole angular distribution parameters for 3d
photoionization in Cs to illustrate a new phenomenon
where impressive manifestations of
intra-doublet in-
interactions producing new structures in
terchannel
nondipole parameters are predicted, thereby also con-
tradicting the notion that correlation does not aﬀect
nondipole parameters signiﬁcantly.

The theoretical results were obtained using a spe-
cially modiﬁed random-phase-approximation with ex-
change (RPAE) approach previously developed for half-
ﬁlled subshells[23, 24]. This calculation showed clearly
the physics of the phenomenon observed[22] and led to
results[21] that are in both qaulitative and quantita-
tive agreement with experimental 3d Xe data. Explic-
itly relativistic calculations[25] were subsequently per-
formed using the relativistic-random-phase approxima-
tion (RRPA)[26] which conﬁrmed the qualitative and
quantitative accuracy of the results in [21].

To summarize the theoretical approach, we consider
the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 subshells each as half-ﬁlled atomic
subshells. This permits us to apply straightforwardly the
RPAE methodology to include many-body correlations
(including interchannel coupling) for half-ﬁlled subshells.

Exchange is neglected between these two sorts of elec-
trons, the six that form the 3d5/2 (called ”up”), and the
four forming 3d3/2 (called ”down”) electrons. However,
in the real half-ﬁlled 3d subshell one would have ﬁve elec-
trons. But these corrections, 6/5 and 4/5, respectively
can be introduced easily into the calculational scheme.

Then we concentrate on the investigation of the inﬂu-
ence of ”up” and ”down” electrons upon each other and
demonstrate that the eﬀect of the 3d3/2 (”down”) elec-
trons upon the 3d5/2 (”up”) manifests itself not only in
the partial cross sections σ5/2(ω), σ3/2(ω)[21] and some-
what in the respective angular anisotropy parameters
β5/2(ω), β3/2(ω)[25], but also in the nondipole parame-
ters of the photoelectron angular distributions, γ(ω) and
δ(ω). In all these cases the eﬀect of the 3d3/2 photoion-
ization channels upon the 3d5/2 leads to the creation of
an additional maximum, while the action of the 3d5/2
electrons upon 3d3/2 proved to be generally negligible.
Note that since the matrix elements for the photoioniza-
tion process are strongly modiﬁed by correlation in the
form of interchannel coupling, it is evident that charac-
teristics of the process other than the integrated cross
section; for example, the photoelectron spin polarization
(see [27] and references therein) are also modiﬁed.

The angular distribution of photoelectrons from an nl
subshell created by linearly polarized light, including the
lowest order nondipole parameters[5, 7, 8, 17, 18] is given
by

σnl(ω)
4π

[1 + βnl(ω)P2(cos θ)

+ [δnl(ω) + γnl(ω)cos2θ]sinθcosφ],

(1)

where σnl(ω) is the partial cross section, βnl(ω) is the
dipole angular anisotropy parameter, γnl(ω) and δnl(ω)
are nondipole parameters, P2(cos θ) is a Legendre poly-
nomial, θ is the angle between the photoelectron and the
photon polarization directions, and φ is the angle be-
tween the photon momentum and the projection of the
photoelectron momentum in the plane perpendicular to
the photon polarization. The expressions for γnl(ω) and
δnl(ω) in terms of dipole and quadrupole matrix elements
were ﬁrst obtained in a slightly diﬀerent form in [5] and
later in [7, 8, 13, 28]. Most of the attention in the past
was given to l = 0 and l = 1, where the expressions for
γnl and δnl are relatively simple. Here we are interested
in the more complex case of l = 2, and the explicit ex-
pressions are given elsewhere[8]. For present purposes,
however, it is necessary to point out that the expressions
involve ratios of quadrupole to dipole matrix elements,
along with cosines of phase shift diﬀerences.

In the present calculation, the 3d → ǫp, ǫf dipole
amplitudes and 3d → ǫs, ǫd, ǫg quadrupole amplitudes
are taken into account for both 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 pho-
toionization. The matrix elements for dipole, dl±1, and

related (HF) approximation, the formulae for γnl(ω)
and δnl(ω) can be used directly with the dipole and
quadrupole amplitudes.

An eﬀect of correlation, however, is to render these
transition matrix elements complex;
the correlated
dipole amplitudes are termed Dl±1 and the correlated
quadrupole amplitudes Ql±2,0. To obtain the corre-
sponding expressions for γnl and δnl, one has to perform
the following substitutions[5, 17]

| dl±1 |2→| ReDl±1 |2 + | ImDl±1 |2
| ql±2,0 |2→| ReQl±2,0 |2 + | ImQl±2,0 |2

where the δl′ are the single-particle (HF) phase shifts for
the designated channel, and Re and Im stand for real
and imaginary parts, respectively.

just as in [21],

The method that we use here,

is
the spin-polarized random-phase approximation with ex-
change (SPRPAE). However, for the intermediate 3d sub-
shell SPRPAE is not suﬃcient; the eﬀects of core rear-
rangement (relaxation) must be taken into account. This
is done by going from RPAE to the generalized (GRPAE)
or, in our case, from SPRPAE to SPGRPAE which takes
into account that while a slow photoelectron leaves the
atom, the ﬁeld seen is modiﬁed due to the alteration (re-
laxation) of the wave functions of all other atomic elec-
trons as a result of the creation of the inner-subshell va-
cancy. GRPAE is discussed at length in [29]. Its exten-
sion for a system with two types of electrons ”up” and
”down”, the transition from SPRPAE to SPGRPAE, is
straightforward.

The results of our calculations for γ for photoionization
of Cs 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 are shown in Fig. 1; both the corre-
lated and the uncorrelated Hartree-Fock (HF) results are
shown to emphasize the features brought about by cor-
relation. As seen from the ﬁgure, the outstanding diﬀer-
ence between correlated and uncorrelated results appears
in the value of γ for 3d5/2 photoionization in the region
just above a photon energy of 740 eV. The fact that this

signiﬁcant structure in γ is not seen in the uncorrelated,
HF, calculation is proof that its existence is due to cor-
relation. Speciﬁcally, we have found that it is due to
interchannel coupling among the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 pho-
toionization channels; by interchannel coupling we mean
simply conﬁguration interaction in the continnum. Since
the ”real” wave function for the ﬁnal continuum state in
a photoionization process is multichannel, there is mixed
in with the ﬁnal state wave functions for 3d5/2 photoion-
ization a small amount of 3d3/2 channels. Then, due to
the 3d → ǫf shape resonance in the region just above the
3d3/2 threshold, the 3d3/2 dipole cross section is much
larger than the 3d5/2. Thus mixing a small amount of
the wave function of the 3d3/2 → ǫf channel with the
wave function of the much smaller 3d5/2 channel alters
the 3d5/2 dipole matrix elements signiﬁcantly; the 3d5/2
cross section maximizes with the 3d5/2 → ǫf just above
its threshold, and drops oﬀ considerably at the energy of
the 3d3/2 → ǫf shape resonance.

But the γ parameter, as discussed above, is essentially
a ratio of quadrupole to dipole matrix elements. There is
also interchannel coupling among the quadrupole chan-
nels, 3d5/2 → ǫs, d, f and 3d3/2 → ǫs, d, f . But there
are no signiﬁcant resonances in any of these channels in
the energy range of interest, and all of the channels are
of more or less the same size. Thus, interchannel cou-
pling does not introduce any important changes in the
quadrupole photoionization matrix elements like it does
in the dipole case. Since only one participant in the ratio
that yields γ changes signiﬁcantly because of correlation,
then it is evident that the ratio itself must be altered
as well. This is the reason for the signiﬁcant structure
seen in Fig. 1 for γ of 3d5/2 in the vicinity of the 3d3/2
threshold.

The only other real eﬀect of correlation on the γ pa-
rameter is for 3d3/2 right at threshold, where the HF
result is noticeably lower than the correlated value. This
again is due to interchannel coupling, but in this case the
eﬀect of the 3d5/2 photoionization channels on the 3d3/2
causes the modiﬁcation. In particular, the 3d3/2 → ǫf
amplitude, which is extremely small at the 3d3/2 thresh-
old, is strongly modiﬁed by its interchannel interaction
with the much larger 3d5/2 amplitudes.

The situation for the δ parameter is shown in Fig. 2
and we ﬁnd here a story similar to that of the γ pa-

3

rameter. A signiﬁcant correlation structure in the 3d5/2
channel, seen just above the 3d3/2 threshold is evident,
along with changes in δ in the 3d3/2 channel just at its
threshold. These eﬀects of correlation occur for exactly
the same reason as discussed above for γ. It is apparent
from comparison of Figs. 1 and 2 that the changes in
δ due to correlation are qualitatively larger than for γ.
This is probably due to the fact that the values of δ are
roughly an order of magnitude smaller than γ.

Owing to the geometry of a number of experimental
setups to measure nondipole photoelectron angular dis-
tributions, γ and δ are often not measured individually[9,
instead, ζ = γ + 3δ is investigated. To connect
10];
with such experimental investigations, ζ for the 3d5/2
and 3d3/2 channels of Cs are shown in Fig. 3. Since ζ is
simply a linear combination of γ and δ, the explanation
for the correlation structure here simply follows from the
previous discussion for γ and δ individually.

In conclusion then, it has been shown that, due to spin-
orbit induced interchannel coupling between the dipole
photoionization channels arising from the two members
of the 3d spin-orbit doublet in Cs, a new structure results
in the nondipole photoelectron angular distribution pa-
rameters γ and δ (and, of course, ζ). Similar results are
found for Xe 3d and Ba 3d; these will be presented in a fu-
ture publication. This is the ﬁrst case of structure in the
energy dependence of nondipole parameters discovered
that is not related to resonances (dipole or quadrupole)
or Cooper minima. And, it was shown explicitly that
correlation in the form of interchannel coupling can in-
deed be important for the nondipole photoelectron angu-
lar distribution parameters, in contradistinction to the
conventional wisdom. Experimental scrutiny into this
prediction is highly desirable.

A new possibility of laser cooling of alkaline-earth-metal and Ytterbium atoms using a two-
photon transition is analyzed. We consider a 1S0 - 1S0 transition, with excitation in near resonance
with the 1P1 level. This greatly increases the two-photon transition rate, allowing an eﬀective
transfer of momentum. The experimental implementation of this technique is discussed and we
show that for Calcium, for example, two-photon cooling can be used to achieve a Doppler limit of
123 microKelvin. The eﬃciency of this cooling scheme and the main loss mechanisms are analyzed.

INTRODUCTION

Laser cooling of neutral atoms and ions has played
a fundamental role in many ﬁelds as metrology, atom
and quantum optics and Bose-Einstein condensation.
For a strong and closed single photon atomic transition
(linewidth ∆ν of a few MHz), a high scattering rate can
quickly reduce the atomic temperature (or velocity) down
to a “Doppler” limit given by the spontaneous emission
rate, typically in the milliKelvin range. The multilevel
atomic structure is essential in other cooling techniques,
as polarization gradient [1], [2], which allow the achieve-
ment of microKelvin temperatures. Although these tech-
niques have been widely applied in metal-alkaline ele-
ments, they are not applicable to the alkaline-earth and
Ytterbium atoms because of their simpler level struc-
ture, with non-degenerate ground states and no hyper-
ﬁne structure. Thus, until recently the smaller tempera-
tures achieved with these elements were in the milliKelvin
range, given by the Doppler limit of the resonant 1S0 -
1P1 cooling transition. MicroKelvin temperatures, close
to the recoil limit, have been achieved for strontium, by
Doppler cooling using the narrower 1S0 - 3P1 intercombi-
nation transition (γ/2π = 7.6 kHz) [3] and also for Ytter-
bium (γ/2π = 182 kHz) [4], an alkaline-earth-like atom.
Cooling using the intercombination transition has also
been demonstrated for Calcium, where the relatively long
lifetime of the 3P1 level (τ = 0.38 ms, γ/2π = 408Hz)
had to be reduced by coupling it to another level [5],
[6] in order to make the cooling process eﬀective. This
“quenching” cooling scheme has also been used several
years ago to cool mercury ions to the zero-point energy
of a trap [7]. With the exception of Ytterbium, cooling
on the intercombination transition was used as a sec-
ond stage, after initial pre-cooling to milliKelvin temper-
atures with the strong 1S0 - 1P1 dipole transition. Al-
though this narrow line cooling can reach temperatures
near the recoil limit, only a small fraction of the atoms
cooled by the strong 1S0 - 1P1 line can be transfered to
the microKelvin regime. For Calcium, for example, only

∗ﬂavio@iﬁ.unicamp.br

about 15% of the atoms captured in a conventional MOT
were transferred to lower temperatures by “quenching”
cooling [5], [6]. Another possibility for obtaining cold
Calcium atoms was recently demonstrated by optically
pumping a fraction of atoms captured in a conventional
MOT into the metastable 3P2 state, and application of a
second stage of laser cooling on the 3P2 - 3D3 transition
to produce metastable Calcium at microKelvin temper-
atures [8].

In this paper we present a new scheme for laser cool-
ing of alkaline-earth and Ytterbium atoms using a two-
photon 1S0 - 1S0 transition. Although laser cooling in-
volving two photons takes place for example in Raman
cooling [9] and “quenching” cooling, so far no two-photon
Doppler cooling has been demonstrated. We show that
two- photon cooling can be quite eﬃcient and might be
used as a second cooling stage, after pre-cooling with
the conventional method. The experimental setup should
be much simpler than in “quenching” cooling, requiring
only one additional laser, with linewidth on the order of
a MegaHertz. In addition, a signiﬁcant temperature re-
duction, with respect to the one-photon Doppler limit,
can be achieved. In Section II, we describe the feasibility
of two-photon cooling and present the calculations of the
transition rates for the one-photon 1S0 - 1P1 and two-
photon 1S0 - 1S0 cooling transitions. In Section III, we
present an analysis of the temperature limit that can be
achieved by this new cooling scheme. Section IV discuss
the main loss mechanisms, considering 40Ca as an exam-
ple. Finally, the conclusions are summarized in Section
V.

II. TWO-PHOTON TRANSITION RATES

Let us consider the interaction of an atom with two co-
propagating laser beams, with wavenumbers k1 = 2π/λ1
and k2 = 2π/λ2 and frequencies ω1 and ω2. Figure 1
(a) shows a diagram of the relevant level structure of
alkaline-earth and Ytterbium atoms. The ground state
is represented by |gi = (ns2)1S0 and the excited states
are |ri = (nsnp)1P1, and |ei = [ns(n + 1)s] 1S0. From
level |ei, the atoms quickly decay to the ground state by
spontaneous emission via the intermediate state |ri, with

relaxation rates γ2 and γ1. Table I presents some rele-
vant parameters for the most abundant isotopes of M g,
Ca, Sr and Y b.

Table I. Parameters of interest for one- and two-photon
cooling in some alkaline-earth-metal and Yb atoms.

We see that for all these atoms the ﬁrst laser is in the
blue or ultraviolet region, while the other laser is at the
near infrared. The resonant saturation intensity for the
blue transition (1S0 - 1P1) is I1s, while I2s is the one for
the infrared transition (1P1 - 1S0). The recoil velocity, af-
ter two-photon absorption, is given by vr = ~(k1+k2)/M ,
where M is the atomic mass. The recoil temperature is
then Tr = M v2
r /kB, where kB is the Boltzmann constant.
Both are obviously higher than in the case of the single
photon 1S0 - 1P1 cooling transition.

Two-photon transition rates are dependent on the light
beam intensities and detunings from real levels and usu-
ally are much smaller than single-photon dipole allowed
transition ones. Nevertheless, they can be quite strong
for spectroscopic purposes, allowing the implementation
of powerful Doppler-free techniques [10], widely used over
the last thirty years. However, in order to reduce the
atomic velocity, they must be high enough to allow an
eﬀective and fast transfer of momentum from the light
ﬁelds to the atom. The general expression for the two-
photon transition rate between levels |gi and |ei is given
by [11] and [12]:

where the matrix elements of the interaction Hamiltonian
between the atomic levels are he |H2| ri and hr |H1| gi.
The detunings, including the Doppler shifts, are ∆r =
ωgr − ω1 + k1 v, and ∆2 = ωeg − ω1 − ω2 + (k1 + k2 )v,
with the Bohr frequencies between the atomic levels |li
and |mi represented by ωlm. The laser detuning relative
to level |ri is deﬁned as δω1 = ω1 − ωgr. The ﬁrst term
of the expression involves a sum on the intermediary lev-
els |ri, which are coupled to |gi by allowed single-photon
transitions. The second factor gives the spectral line pro-
ﬁle of the two-photon transition of a single atom, which
In
has a two-photon detuning δω2 = ω1 + ω2 − ωeg.

order to preserve angular momentum in a ∆J = 0 tran-
sition (1S0 - 1S0), we are also assuming σ1(−) and σ2(+)
polarizations for the two laser beams at λ1 and λ2 re-
spectively (see Fig.1 (b)). Although σ1(+) and σ2(−)
photons can be absorbed from opposite directions, this
possibility will not be considered here. Polarization se-
lection rules for two-photon transitions are discussed in
[10] and [13]. For alkaline-earth-metals and Ytterbium,
Eq. (1) can be written as:

in this last equation the possibility of saturation of the

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the transition rates Γge/2π
and Γgr/2π, as a function of the one-photon detun-
ing |∆r|, normalized by γ1,
for a two-photon detun-
ing |∆2| = γ2 /2, and saturation parameters S1 = 0.1
and S2 = 3. The calculations were made for Magne-
sium (dashed), Calcium (solid), Strontium (dash-dot)
and Ytterbium (doted curve). The chosen saturation pa-
rameters made the one- and two-photon transition rates
of the same magnitude. For 40Ca, for example, they
correspond to (see Table I) I1(ω1) ≈ 6mW/cm2, and
I2(ω2) ≈ 2mW/cm2. In fact over 100 mW of laser ra-
diation at 422.8 nm can be generated by frequency dou-
bling near infrared diode lasers [15] or a Ti:sapphire laser
[16]. Radiation at 1034 nm can be generated with a
Ti:sapphire laser or with a Yb:YAG laser. With this
last option, powers over 500 mW are readily achieved.
Even at low power levels the two-photon transition rate
can still be signiﬁcant. We can see in Fig. 2 (a) that,
for |∆r | < γ1, the two-photon transition rate is about
1 MHz, therefore a little smaller than the rates of the
conventional cooling transitions of metal-alkaline atoms.
If we assume, for example, red detuning of the incident
lasers, ∆r = −γ1/2 and ∆2 = −γ2/2, the two-photon
transition rate will be Γge/2π = 1.2 M Hz for Calcium.
For these parameters, the single-photon transition rate is
Γgr/2π = 826 kHz.

3

(5)

The two-photon transition rate can be much higher
than the one-photon rate, if the saturation parameter S2
is much higher than S1. However, as we will see in the
next section, increasing the second laser intensity results
in an increase of the equilibrium temperature, due to the
heating caused by spontaneous emission.

III. DOPPLER - COOLING LIMIT

The temperature limit in laser cooling is determined
by a balance between damping forces and heating due to
spontaneous emission. For a two-level system, consider-
ing an one-photon process this Doppler limit is kBTD =
~γ1/2, while the recoil limit is given by kBTr = ~2k2
1/M .
In general, TD >> Tr, for one-photon cooling transitions
of alkalis.

A. Two-photon Process

The Doppler temperature limit can be estimated by
the balance between heating and cooling, giving kBTD =

D/α [14], where D is the diﬀusion constant and α is the
damping coeﬃcient. Lets consider one atom interacting
with two copropagating σ2 (+), σ1 (−) laser beams (see
Fig.1 (b)). The direct excitation from |gi to |ei by the
simultaneous absorption of two photons, ω1 + ω2 , occurs
with a rate Γge, given by Eq. (2). From the upper level
|ei, the atom spontaneously decays to the intermediate
|ri level with a rate γ2 and, from this level, with a rate
γ1 to the ground state. On average, the time it takes
one atom to absorb simultaneously two photons and go
back to the ground state by spontaneous cascade decay
is given by:

∆t = Γ

If the atom is moving in the opposite direction of the laser
beams (left side of Fig. 1-b), then a mean radiation force,
F+, can be written as the ratio between the momentum
change ∆p = ~(k1 + k2), and the time interval ∆t:

where xi = δωi/γi (i = 1, 2) are the detunings normalized
by the natural linewidths of the transitions, and we have
disregarded terms on the order of (kv)2/γ2. Adding one
pair of σ1 (+) and σ2 (−) laser beams counterpropagating
to the ﬁrst ones (right side of Fig. 1-b), an additional
force F− will act on the atom, and we have a conﬁgu-
ration of an one-dimension two-photon optical molasses.

In this conﬁguration, the radiation pressure reduces to

ities, if δω1, δω2 < 0, similar to the case of “one-photon

optical molasses”. For low intensities and far from sat-
uration of the transitions (S1 << 1, S1 · S2 << 1) we
have:

where the saturation of the one- and two-photon transi-
tions by the two pairs of counter-propagating beams was
taken into account, and we have disregarded the Doppler
shifts: |v| << γ1/k1 , γ2 /(k1 + k2 ).

The momentum diﬀusion constant in a “two-photon
molasses”, D2, can be estimated through a straightfor-
ward generalization of the analysis of the random walk
process in “one-photon molasses” made by Lett et al.
[17]. Although the damping force reduces the average ve-
locity of the atoms to zero, the ﬂuctuations of this force
produce heating, due the spontaneous emission, which
leads to a spread in the mean square momentum:

d(p2)/dt = 2 · ~2 · (k2

1 + k2

2 ) · Γge = 2 · D2.

(9)

In analogy to [17], the resultant momentum diﬀusion con-
stant in a “two-photon molasses” is:

D2 =

(cid:1)

The rate of

increase of kinetic energy in this
“two-photon molasses” is given by (dE/dt)heat =
d(p2/2M )/dt = D2/M . When the equilibrium is
reached, the heating and cooling rates are equal, that
is, (dE/dt)cool + (dE/dt)heat = 0. Therefore, using equa-
tions (8) and (10), the Doppler temperature is estimated:

(11)

We recognize the ﬁrst term on Eq. (11), as the one-photon
Doppler limit, T1 = ~γ1 /2kB, which is 1.94 mK, 831 µK,
108 µK and 672 µK, respectively for Magnesium, Cal-
cium, Strontium and Ytterbium atoms. The detunings
that minimize the two-photon Doppler temperature are
xi = −1/2 (δω1 = −γ1/2, δω2 = −γ2/2), giving the
minimum value

kBTmin = ~γ1 ·

(k1 + k2 ) · [k1 + (k1 + k2 ) · (γ1 /γ2)]

.(12)

Using the parameters of Table I we obtain the follow-
ing temperatures: Tmin = 131 µK, 123 µK, 57 µK and
124 µK, respectively for Magnesium, Calcium, Strontium
and Ytterbium. These minimum values of temperature
are very close for these elements because the linewidths
of the second transition, γ2 , are very similar (see Table I).
This does not happen for the one-photon Doppler limit.
The predicted ratio between the one- and two-photon
Doppler temperatures will be then ~γ1 /(2kBTmin) = 14.8
(M g), 6.8 (Ca), 1.9 (Sr) and 5.4 (Y b) (Table II). Equa-
tions (11) and (12) are valid only for low laser intensities
(S1 << 1, S1 · S2 << 1). If we take into account higher

intensities, the result is an increase of temperatures, as
in the case of “one-photon optical molasses” [17].

B. Combined One- and Two-Photon Cooling Pro-
cesses

Since the one-photon 1S0 - 1P1 and two-photon 1S0
- 1S0 transitions occurs simultaneously, we should con-
sider both cooling processes jointly. Depending on the
detunings and intensities of the incident laser beams, one
process can dominate the other. The case of “one-photon
optical molasses” was discussed in several references, and
results in the following coeﬃcients [14], [17]:

taking into account the saturation of the ﬁrst transition
involving the blue laser at frequency ω1 . The eﬀective
damping and diﬀusion coeﬃcients that jointly take into
account the one- and two-photon cooling processes are:

and the Doppler equilibrium temperature is obtained by
kBTD = Def f /αef f . Figure 3 presents this temperature
for Calcium atoms, as a function of the infrared satu-
ration parameter S2, for several values of the ﬁrst laser
saturation parameter (S1 = 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.01). The
laser detunings were assumed to be at the optimum val-
ues δω2 = −γ2 /2 and δω1 = −γ1 /2. Some features in
Fig. 3 call our attention. The limit of low intensities
of the infrared laser (S2 << 1) results in a tempera-
ture expected on the basis of the two-level atom theory:
~γ1/2kB = 831 µK for Calcium. However, for low inten-
sities of the blue laser (S1 << 1) and with the increase
of the S2 parameter, the Doppler temperature is quite
reduced, tending to the minimum value of 123 µK (dash
dot-doted curve; see also Table II). This minimum value
of temperature is close to the Doppler limit that would
be associated only with the second transition, that is,
~γ2/2kB = 115 µK for Calcium atoms. As already men-
tioned, this new Doppler limit is 6.8 times smaller than
the one-photon Doppler limit of the blue transition. This
happens due to the increase of the damping coeﬃcient for
the combined cooling processes. For the other elements
of Table II this reduction factor varies considerably de-
pending on the values of the linewidths γ1 and γ2.

IV. EFFICIENCY OF THE COOLING PROCESS
AND MAIN LOSS MECHANISMS

5

In this section, we discuss the main loss mechanisms
that can limit the eﬃciency of the Doppler cooling
scheme discussed here. It is important to know the popu-
lation fraction in the excited states |ri and |ei, which can
be lost by spontaneous emission into metastable levels
that do not participate in the cooling process, or through
photoionization induced by the incident laser beams.

Figure 4 shows some possible loss channels that can
limit the cooling process, again using Calcium as an ex-
ample. One of these channels is the spontaneous de-
cay from the (4s4p)1P1 to the (3d4p)1D2 level, at a
rate γP D = 2180s−1 [18]. For Magnesium, the 1D2
state is above the 1P1 level, so this loss channel is not
present. Another is the direct spontaneous decay from
the (4s5s)1S0 level to the 3P1 level, at 553 nm, which
occurs at a rate of 2440(600)s−1 [5]. A third loss channel
is due to photoionization of the excited state (4s5s)1S0,
which can be connected to the (3d6p)1P1 level above the
ionization limit by a photon at 423 nm. The photoion-
ization rate for this process is given by Γion = σion(ω1)
x I(ω1)/(~ω1) [19], where σion(ω1) is the photoioniza-
tion cross-section, at the blue laser frequency. Although
this cross-section has not been reported in the literature,
we do not expect an expressive photoionization rate for
Calcium, because this process can be considered far oﬀ-
resonance. The branching ratio of the ionization process
with respect to the spontaneous decay to the intermedi-
ate level |ri, and from this to the ground state should
be very low, because Γion << γ1, γ2, for small values
of intensity of the blue laser. This is not the case of
Magnesium, where photoionization is an important loss
channel.

The atomic populations of the excited states (Fig.1 (a))
can be calculated using the density matrix formalism,
applied to a three-level atom interacting with two laser
beams [20]. The optical Bloch equations (OBE’s) for
the density matrix elements, with the terms ρij (i, j =
g, r, e) varying slowly in the rotating-wave approximation
(RWA), are given by:

where atomic coherences obey the relation ρ∗
ij = ρji. We
have assumed in these equations that the linewidths of
the incident laser beams are smaller than the half natural
widths of the atomic transitions, that is, ∆ν1 < γ1/2,
∆ν2 < γ2/2. A linewidth of about a MegaHertz would
satisfy this condition, and is tipical of, for example, a
commercially available Ti:Sapphire laser.

The coupled OBE’s in Eqs.(17) are numerically solved
by integrating over the time t, via a Runge-Kutta fourth-
order method, with the initial conditions: ρij(t = 0) =
δig. The populations ρee and ρrr for Calcium atoms can
be seen in Fig.5 (a) and (b) respectively, where the blue
laser saturation parameter is S1 = 0.1, while the infrared
saturation parameters are: S2 = 1 (doted), 3 (dashed)
and 10 (solid line). We can observe in Fig. 5 that the in-
crease of the infrared laser intensity results in an increase
of the excited state populations, due to optical pumping.
However, in the steady-state regime (t → ∞), the per-
centage of excited atoms is low (< 10%), corresponding
to a high fraction of atoms in the ground state.

An important parameter that characterizes the dy-
namics of the cooling process is the cooling time, τcool.
This time for the two-photon cooling can be calculated
by the relationship between the kinetic energy and its
loss rate:

τcool = −

E
(dE/dt)cool

=

M
2αef f

.

(18)

Recalling equation (15), the last expression implies in
a decrease of the cooling time, in comparison to one-
photon cooling: τcool = M
2α1 . For Calcium
we have τcool ≈ 2µs, for δωi = −γi/2, S1 = 0.1 and
S2 = 3. Since this time is much shorter than the storage
time, dictated by optical pumping into the metastable
1D2 state [8], two-photon cooling should be a fast and
eﬃcient process.

Another important parameter is the capture velocity,
which is on the order of γ1 /k1 = 14.7 m/s for the one-

photon cooling process in Calcium atoms [14]. In general
the average force written in equation (6) reduces to F =
−α2 · v/[1 + (v/vc)2], and the capture velocity for the
two-photon cooling is a little smaller, on the order of
vc = (γ1 + γ2 )/(2k1 + 2k2) for detunings |δωi| = γi/2.
For Calcium vc = 6 m/s is much larger than the mean
velocity of the atoms already cooled in the ﬁrst cooling
~γ1/(2M ) = 41.6 cm/s. This fact
process: vrms =
(vrms << vc) implies that the initial number of atoms
that were captured in the ﬁrst cooling stage should be
transferred completely into the second one, resulting in
a signiﬁcant number of colder atoms.
In other words,
the transfer eﬃciency from the ﬁrst (one-photon) to the
second (two-photon) stage should be basically 100%.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

We proposed a new possibility to reach microKelvin
temperatures in laser cooling of alkaline-earth-metal and
Ytterbium atoms, using a two-photon 1S0 - 1S0 transi-
tion. After discussing the implementation of this tech-
nique and the calculation of the transition rates, we ana-
lyzed the experimental cases of atomic interaction with a
pair of copropagating laser beams and two-photon opti-
cal molasses. We considered excitation with laser beams
at frequencies ω1 and ω2, in near resonance with the
1P1 state, to enhance the two-photon scattering rate.
Doppler limits of 131 µK (Mg), 123 µK (Ca), 57 µK
(Sr) and 124 µK (Yb) have been found at optimum de-
tunings and laser powers. Since the optimum detuning
for the blue 1S0 - 1P1 transition is γ1 /2, two-photon cool-
ing can be simply applied as a second stage, just by
adding the second near-infrared laser. This will bring
all atoms to substantially lower temperatures (for exam-
ple from 831 to 123 µK for Calcium). With such 100%
eﬃciency, it should not be expected any loss of atoms
in this second cooling stage.
It is important to point
out that two-photon cooling is considerably simpler than
“quenching” cooling, requiring only one extra laser, with

a linewidth of about a MegaHertz. The two-photon cool-
ing scheme should be applicable to a 3D optical molasses
or a magneto-optical trap, in this case taking advantage
of the magnetic intermediate state 1P1. This will be in-
vestigated in a future work. We also expect to make the
experimental implementation of this technique with the
addition of the 1034-nm laser in our 3D Calcium optical
molasses and MOT [21]. Finally, the lower temperatures
achieved by two-photon cooling can be also very useful for
eﬃcient loading of an optical dipole trap, which might be
an important step towards the achievement of all-optical
Bose-Einstein condensates [22] for alkaline-earth-metal

and Ytterbium atoms.

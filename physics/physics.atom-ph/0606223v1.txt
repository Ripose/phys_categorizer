We show that the vibrational state tailoring method developed for molecular systems can be
applied for cold atoms in optical lattices. The original method is based on a three-level model
interacting with two strong laser pulses in a counterintuitive sequence [M. Rodriguez et al., Phys.
Rev. A 62, 053413 (2000)]. Here we outline the conditions for achieving similar dynamics with single
time-dependent potential surfaces. It is shown that guided switching between diabatic and adiabatic
evolution has an essential role in this system. We also show that eﬃcient and precise tailoring of
motional states in optical lattices can be achieved, for instance, simply by superimposing two lattices
and moving them with respect to each other.

INTRODUCTION

Complete control of atomic center-of-mass motion is
one of the main principles of physics with cold atoms [1,
2] and ions [3, 4]. Cooling of atomic samples allows
their trapping with far-oﬀ resonant optical traps [5] or
with spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds [6]. This
has made it possible, for example, to explore the quan-
tum statistics of bosonic and fermionic atoms [6, 7], to
develope ultra-high precision spectroscopy and atomic
clocks [8], and to produce cold molecules by photoassoci-
ation [9]. One speciﬁc example is an optical lattice, where
the internal state structure of atoms and the polarization
states of light combine to produce periodic and control-
lable potentials for atoms [10]. By suﬃcient cooling the
atoms can be localized into the lattice sites. The situa-
tion is reminiscent of solid state systems, and interesting
eﬀects such as formation of a Mott insulator [11, 12] or
the surface of a Fermi sea [13, 14] have been observed.
This has motivated ideas of building quantum simulators
for solid state phenomena, and even quantum comput-
ers [15, 16]. For such purposes one needs a wide-ranging
and versatile toolbox for the quantum control of atomic
motion.

In optical lattices atoms can either move in the Bloch
bands of the periodic structure, or become localized at
lattice sites (not forgetting the interesting intermediate
region where the motion or “hopping” takes place by
quantum tunnelling between the lattice sites). Here we
consider the case of rather deep localization, where the
eigenstates of the atomic center-of-mass states are quite
discrete in energy and become the vibrational states of a
single lattice site. Our aim is to develop a tool for mov-
ing atoms eﬃciently and selectively to these vibrational
states if they are initially in the vibrational ground state.
Especially, we want to consider the case where the state
change is associated with a move from one lattice site to
another.

∗Electronic address: Kari.Harkonen@utu.ﬁ

We approach the problem with ideas originally pro-
posed for the quantum control of vibrational states in
dimer molecules [17, 18, 19]. Note that for atoms the
vibrational states are center-of-mass states, whereas in
molecules they correspond to the internal motion, i.e.,
relative motion of the nuclei. An eﬃcient method to move
molecules between vibrational states is STIRAP (STImu-
lated Raman Adiabatic Passage) [20], which is based on
the existence of a noninteracting eigenstate in a three-
level system and a counterintuitive pulse sequence. The
advantage of the method is its high eﬃciency (popula-
tion transfer is nearly complete), robustness in relation
to the parameters, and the elimination of the intermedi-
ate state. For molecules as well as for atoms in a lattice
the intermediate state would usually be an electronically
excited one, which normally decays rapidly and incoher-
ently.

The standard STIRAP approach, however, is strongly
dependent on overlap integrals between the vibrational
states, which in molecules means favorable Franck-
Condon factors. This limits the achievable “stretch-
ing” of the molecules as the process needs to adhere to
the Franck-Condon principle.
In addition, any imple-
mentation for optical lattices would require additional
pulsed laser ﬁelds. An interesting and viable alterna-
tive in molecules is oﬀered by very strong pulses, which
actually aﬀect the vibrational state structure [21]. As
demonstrated in Ref. [17], this situation can be modelled
with LIP’s, i.e., light-induced potentials, which are the
time-dependent potential surfaces associated with the in-
stantaneous eigenstates of the combined system of three
electronic states and two pulses. In fact, the process is de-
scribed by adiabatic evolution along a single LIP, which
eﬃciently takes the molecule from one electronic state
to another. As the equilibrium positions associated with
each electronic state may be quite diﬀerent, the process
leads to an apparent breakdown of the Franck-Condon
principle. Later it was shown that with a proper set-
ting of parameters one can decide whether the vibrational
state is changed during the process as well [18].

Here we show that the same method is applicable for
atoms in optical lattices or in double-well structures.

First we demonstrate that under suitable conditions we
can indeed reduce the system of three states and two
pulses into a single time-dependent potential. As ex-
plained in Sec. II, this is not so straightforward as one
could assume. The fact that the process is not completely
adiabatic (as noted in Ref. [18]) plays a role here, as well
as in tuning the parameters to achieve the population
of a speciﬁc vibrational state.
In Sec. III we provide
some numerical results that demonstrate the practicality
of the approach, and in Sec. III E we address speciﬁcally
the two-dimensional case (the original molecular studies
were performed in one dimension). A special case of two
optical lattices that can be moved with respect to each
other is treated in Sec. IV. Finally, we conclude our pre-
sentation in Sec. V with a discussion on applications of
the method.

II. THREE-STATE AND SINGLE-STATE
DESCRIPTIONS

In case of molecular dimers, the system is originally
described in terms of a three-component statevector con-
sisting of electronic state wavefunctions [18]. Let us de-
note the statevector components ψi(x, t), i = 1, 0, 2 (fol-
lowing Ref. [18]). Consequently, the time evolution of
such a statevector Ψ(x, t) is given by the scaled time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation

i

∂
∂t

Ψ(x, t) = −∇2Ψ(x, t) + V(x, t)Ψ(x, t),

(1)

where x and t are the scaled position and time. Because
of the used scaling, every quantity is expressed with a di-
mensionless number, and especially ~ = 1 and m = 1/2.
The associated electronic potentials and state couplings
form the matrix

V(x, t) =

V1(x) Ω1(t)

j ],

i = 1, 0, 2,

j = 1, 2.

(4)

In other words, we assume either harmonic or ﬂat poten-
tials and Gaussian pulses. Also, we have above applied
the rotating wave approximation (RWA), which allows
us to shift potentials appropriately. Thus the potentials
Vi(x) are parameterized by trapping frequencies ωi and
detunings ∆i, and the coupling terms Ωj(t) include max-
imum Rabi frequencies Ω0
j and timescales for the pulses
Tj. The role of parameters and the eﬀect of RWA is
demonstrated in Fig. 1.

We assume that ∆1 = 0 and ω0 = 0. This assumption
is justiﬁed because the eﬀect of ∆1 is merely a universal
shift in the energy levels and the shape of the potential

2

V0 does not have any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the results [18].
We are interested in adiabatic time evolution with the
exception that time evolution may include sudden rapid
diabatic behavior. The potential matrix (2) can always
be diagonalized and we obtain three real eigenvalues as a
result. Note that these eigenvalues depend both on time
and position; they can be considered as new potentials
in the eigenstate basis. We label these light-induced po-
tentials (LIP’s) with ˜Vi(x, t). The eigenstate basis turns
out to be equivalent to the adiabatic basis and the orig-
inal three-state basis is called the diabatic basis. The
numbering of the eigenstates goes as 1, 2 and 3, with
increasing energy.

Figure 1: (a) The initial system consists of three individual
potential surfaces coupled to each other via two pulsed lasers
with frequencies νi. (b) In the rotating wave approximation
(RWA) the system is characterized by Rabi frequencies Ωi
and detunings ∆i. (c) Finally, the light-induced potentials
(LIP’s) are derived from the RWA potential matrix, Eq. (2),
as its time and position dependent eigenvalues, shown here
by dark lines.

In our model the couplings Ωi in the diabatic basis
are initially (for t ≪ t1, t2) and ﬁnally (for t ≫ t1, t2)
practically but not quite zero. Then the diabatic and
adiabatic potentials are very much alike, except that any
degeneracy is a level crossing for the ﬁrst case, and an
avoided crossing for the second case, see Fig. 1(c).
If
we are initially on the diabatic state 1, in the molecular
model this means that adiabatic evolution will keep us in
the appropriate electronic eigenstate, which at the ﬁnal
point turns out to have evolved into the diabatic state 2.
For a system with three states this works very well, but
if we merely take the eigenstate potential ˜V1(x, t) and
solve the appropriate single-state Schr¨odinger equation,

we ﬁnd that initially our system corresponds to a double-
well potential [combination of V1(x) and V2(x); here x1
and x2 are assumed to be clearly diﬀerent]. As the right-
hand well begins to move down in energy initially due
to the strengthening coupling pulse Ω2, the separating
energy barrier is too weak to hold the initial state lo-
calised to the potential well V1(x), see again Fig. 1(c).
In the three-state model this problem does not arise, be-
cause initially the system is held by the diabatic potential
V1(x).

In other words, the apparent adiabatic evolution along
a single LIP is possible in the model only because in
reality the evolution is diabatic initially and ﬁnally, and
adiabaticity sets in only in the middle of the process. In
order to work with truly single-state models, we need to
modify the molecular approach. An obvious solution is
to make x1 and x2 time-dependent as well, by setting
their initial and ﬁnal values suﬃciently large, so that the
double-well potential barrier is strong when the adiabatic
description would otherwise fail, see Fig. 2.

tial surface is located above the centers of the two harmonic
ones, as in Fig. 1(c). Due to the counterintuitive pulse order
(t1 > t2), the right-hand-side well drops down ﬁrst, but the
initially large position separation keeps the system in the di-
abatic state 1 long enough. The grey dashed lines mark x1(t)
and x2(t).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE
SINGLE-STATE MODEL

A. Description of numerical methods

We consider

the single-state wavefunction as a
wavepacket of plane waves and evolve it in a discretized

3

(5)

(6)

space numerically with the methods of wavepacket dy-
namics [22]. We solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation using the split-operator and fast Fourier trans-
formation (FFT) methods. In addition, for a better un-
derstanding of dynamics we follow Ref. [18] and solve
also the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation for ﬁxed
moments of time using the Numerov algorithm [23]. We
simplify our notation by deﬁning

ψ(x, t) ≡ ψ1(x, t),

˜V (x, t) ≡

˜V1(x, t),
˜V2(x, t),

(

if ∆2 > 0,
if ∆2 < 0.

Obviously, it would be seemingly practical to set the
three-state model completely aside instead of using it as
a tool for obtaining the single-state LIP, but with this ap-
proach we can use the knowledge obtained with previous
studies of the molecular system.

To model the time-dependence of x1 and x2, we rede-

ﬁne our diabatic potentials V1 and V2 as

j [x − xj(t)]2 + ∆j,

,

(cid:1)

1 = Ω0

where ts is the moment when the individual potential
wells are closest to each other (Fig. 2). For simplicity we
use in our calculations equal maximum Rabi frequencies
Ω0
2 ≡ Ω and equal timescales of the pulses T1 =
T2 ≡ T . Pulses are applied in a counterintuitive order,
that is t1 > t2. We choose the time ts so that ts =
1
2 (t1+t2). Since the individual potential wells are initially
apart from each other, we can consider them eﬀectively as
two separate harmonic potentials, and as a consequence,
we select our initial state ψ(t0) to be case-speciﬁcally the
ground or excited state of the harmonic potential V1.

B. One-dimensional case

In our scaled units time t evolves from values 0 to 25
and position ranges from −3 to 3. We choose the mo-
ments for the pulse maxima as t1 = 15 and t2 = 10.
The pulse timescales T are set to T = 5. The trap-
ping frequencies of the harmonic potentials V1 and V2
are ω1 = ω2 = 20. As for the shifting parameters, we set
α1 = −α2 = −1.5, β1 = −β2 = 1.0, and γ1 = γ2 = 0.30
[cf. the trajectories of xj (t) in Fig. 2]. As stated earlier,
we have set ω0 = 0 and ∆1 = 0.

The above settings leave as control parameters ∆0, ∆2,
and Ω. If we set ∆0 = 850, ∆2 = 0 and Ω = 274, we
obtain the basic case of a transfer from the ground vi-
brational state of potential V1 to the ground vibrational
state of potential V2 in the three-state model. The evolu-
tion is plotted in Fig. 3(a). The change from one ground
state to another one is almost complete.

As an alternative selection we can take ∆0 = 850, ∆2 =
−20, Ω = 162. Fig. 3(b) shows that the ﬁnal state be-
comes the ﬁrst excited state of potential V2, as expected
for the analogous three-state case.

Figure 3: (a) Time evolution for a process that drives popu-

native process where the excited vibrational states is reached.
Here ∆0 = 850, ∆2 = −20, and Ω = 162.

By further changing parameter values it is possible to
achieve transfer from the ground state of V1 to various
excited states of V2, as shown in Fig. 4 (upper panels). As
in the three-state case, it is also possible to return com-
pletely to the state V1, but with a diﬀerent vibrational
state. The initial state can also be a vibrationally excited
one for V1. One can also make the transfer incomplete,
which produces well-to-well superposition states. Note
also, by comparing Fig. 3(a) with Fig. 4(a), and Fig. 3(b)
with Fig. 4(d), that the number of peaks at the midpoint
of evolution can be diﬀerent even if the initial and ﬁnal
states are the same. We return to this issue in Sec. III D.

C. The role of parameters

The number of parameters in the full three-state model
is very large: maximum Rabi frequencies Ω0
j , detun-
ings ∆i, trapping frequencies ωi, timescales of pulses Tj,
and pulse delay ∆t = t1 − t2. Furthermore, one can con-
sider asymmetric pulse shapes, chirped pulses or some
diﬀerent potential geometry. Consequently, the param-
eter space is too large for a complete mapping, and we
limit our discussion to the eﬀect of ∆0, ∆2, and Ω within
the previous parameter settings. With these three pa-
rameters, we are already able to target arbitrary vibra-
tional states of both V1 and V2.

The sign of ∆0 is essential. Choosing ∆0 < 0, i.e., lo-
cating V0(x) below the other two curves, will result in the
very robust APLIP process [17], in which the wavepacket
is smoothly transferred from one ground state to another,

4

but no other tailoring is possible. The opposite selection
leads to much richer dynamics and excitations become
possible as well [18], but we pay for it with the dynam-
ics becoming far more sensitive to the parameters.
In
short, as long as |∆0| is large enough, its sign is a suﬃ-
cient switch between the two cases. From an alternative
point of view, changing the sign of ∆0 is also equivalent
to swapping the pulses Ω1 ↔ Ω2.

The role of Ω is intuitively clear: the more powerful are
the couplings, the more are the adiabatic potentials mod-
ulated. On the other hand, Ω and |∆0| counteract each
other, such that the larger |∆0|, the larger values of Ω are
needed to modify the potentials by the required amount.
Of course, they do not exactly cancel each other, since
lower values of |∆0| tend to allow the wells to broaden,
too. Nevertheless, the cancellation is eﬃcient from the
point of view of regions close to the minima of the wells,
where the dynamics is also concentrated. Therefore, the
counterplay between the detuning ∆0 and the coupling
strength Ω explains, e.g., the plotted stripe structure of
Fig. 3 in Ref. [19]. We have veriﬁed the existence of these
stripes also in our single-state model.

The detuning ∆2 between potentials V1 and V2 has an
obvious function. If the potentials Vj are to be consid-
ered one by one, they each have their own (and in this
case the same) frequency ω. Because of our scaling, the
corresponding energy diﬀerence between the harmonic
eigenstates is ∆E = ω in the scaled units. Starting with
∆2 = 0, we can ﬁnd such combinations of parameters
that will lead to the transfer of the population from one
ground state to another as in Fig. 3(a). The basic idea
is that lowering V2 by ∆2 = −∆E will drive the popula-
tion now into the ﬁrst excited state with approximately
the same parameters [cf. Fig. 3(b)]. This generalizes to
higher excited states as well: ∆2 = −n × ∆E, n ∈ N,
will lead to the nth excited state of potential 2. Inter-
estingly, by setting ∆2 = −(n + 1/2) × ∆E and keeping
Ω ≤ 100 we always get the initial state, i.e., lowest vibra-
tional state of potential 1 back, but by increasing Ω we
can reach the higher vibrational states of potential 1. So
the tuning process is clearly sensitive to the value of Ω,
as shown in Fig. 5.

In the mapping of Fig. 5 we can see that the ﬁnal out-
come forms regular patterns. Especially, clear system-
aticity arises. On the one hand, higher vibrational states
of V1 are gained by increasing Ω while ∆2 acts only in a
periodic way. On the other hand, the higher vibrational
states of V2 are achieved by decreasing ∆2 while Ω has
no signiﬁcant role.

Interpretation in vibrational basis

In order to understand the role of the parameter
choices and the dynamics in general, we have followed
Ref. [18] and analysed the situation by solving the in-
stantaneous vibrational states of the relevant LIP (we call
them LIP eigenstates). If the two wells are suﬃciently

the two wells move with respect to each other in energy.
With large enough values of Ω, the changes are consid-
erable, if compared to the energy separations ∆E. Con-
sequently, in terms of the LIP eigenstates, the states ap-
proximately corresponding to the single well eigenstates
appear to cross each other. This phenomenon can be
easily seen in the energy spectra (cf. Fig. 4). Of course,
there is always a small energy gap between the energies,
i.e., the crossings are in fact avoided.

separated, the lowest few LIP eigenstates are very much
similar to those of two single harmonic potentials V1 and
V2, except for the narrow degenerated cases, when the en-
ergies of two LIP eigenstates coincide. As the energy of a
LIP eigenstate gets comparable to the height of the sep-
arating potential barrier, it starts to have non-negligible
component in both wells, as seen in Fig. 6.

During the pulses the double-well potential gets mod-
ulated in such a manner, that the potential barrier be-
comes lower or even disappears. Accordingly, the set of
corresponding LIP eigenstates changes as well. As the
height of the barrier gradually decreases, the minima of

the given choice of parameters, the transformations from
one eigenstate to another happen in timescale of τ n
cross ∼
10−2, which is less than the vibrational timescale of the
potential τvib ∼ 10−1. Accordingly, the wavepacket can-
not succeed in following these changes in the vibrational
basis, and therefore a diabatic jump between the LIP
eigenstates occurs.

Between the sharp diabatic crossings, the system fol-
lows a particular LIP eigenstate adiabatically. Adiabatic
following occurs when the energy gap between the two
approaching LIP eigenstates is large. Consequently, in
case there are many possible energy level crossings, the
timescale of potential modulations τpot can be used as a
switch to determine which crossings are passed diabati-
cally and which adiabatically. By making a crossing into
a mixture of diabatic and adiabatic, one can reach super-

positions, although the precise result is likely to be very
sensitive on parameter values.

It is worthwhile to emphasize, that the seemingly rapid
and radical changes in the appearence of the wave packet
typically around t ≈ 10 and t ≈ 15 do not have anything
to do with diabatic crossings. In Fig. 6 we have plotted
the LIP eigenstates corresponding the choice of param-
eters in Fig. 4(d). By comparing these ﬁgures, it is ob-
vious, that the diabatic jump occurs already at t ≈ 7,
when nothing seem to yet happen in the time evolution.
Interestingly, the subsequent changes in the course of
evolution are in fact due to the evolution of the corre-
sponding LIP eigenstate itself. Therefore, all the visible
transformations are actually a manifestation of adiabatic
following.

Returning to the discussion of Fig. 5 in the previous
section, we are now ready to give explanation to the pat-
tern. Let us denote the number of sharp LIP energy level
crossings by (n, m), where n and m, respectively, count
the crossings before and after the pulse maxima. For
example, the situation in Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the
notation (0, 1).

The edges of the zones arise for two reasons. Firstly,
those with a positive slope occur because a new LIP en-
ergy level crossing is being formed prior the pulses, i.e.,
(n, m) ↔ (n + 1, m) at the edge. Secondly, those with a
negative slope are associated with a creation of a crossing
after the pulses, i.e., (n, m) ↔ (n, m+1) at the edge. Yet
another rule for crossings can be formulated, but it does
not correspond to any visible edge in the mapping. The
third rule is, that when passing the resonance detuning
∆2 ≡ 0 (mod ∆E) from above, one crossing travels via
inﬁnity from left to right, i.e., (n, m) ↔ (n − 1, m + 1).
Illustration of the rules is given in Fig. 7 (cf. spectra in
Fig. 4 and the mapping in Fig. 5).

With the three rules, we can see that |n − m| ≤ 1. If
n = m, then the nth vibrational state of potential V1 is
achieved. If n = m ± 1, then a state in V2 is reached,
such that each increment of −∆E = −20 in ∆2 intro-
duces one step higher excitations. Advancing towards
greater values of Ω brings along more diabatic jumps.

Naturally, the stability suﬀers as the complexity of the
process increases, which can be seen as a degeneration of
the pattern with large values of Ω.

E. Two-dimensional case

So far we have studied only the one-dimensional case.
In two dimensions, we set the potentials symmetric for
simplicity and apply a time-dependent shift to the poten-
tials V1 and V2. The shifting is the same as previously in
the one-dimensional case, but it is conducted only in one
direction, as deﬁned in Eq. (8).

There is no coupling between the cartesian coordinates
x and y in the potentials V1 and V2. Accordingly, Eq. (1)
is separable in x and y. Thus the two-dimensional system
is in practice split into one-dimensional slices which are
labelled by x = constant. The only diﬀerence between
two x = constant slices is a shift in energy. Therefore,
we can expect the system to behave in a similar way as a
one-dimensional system. Our numerical results conﬁrm
this, see Fig. 8.

We have used the same parameter values in our calcu-
lations as in the corresponding one-dimensional case. It
should be emphasized, though, that the two-dimensional

diabatic crossings: one before the pulse maxima and an-
other one after them. We now propose a possible scheme
which will include only one set of energy level crossings.
With the interest in optical lattices, we formulate the
problem in terms of sinusoidal potentials. The modula-
tion of the potential is done by another sinusoidal poten-
tial (but with a doubled frequency), which can be moved
with respect to the other one (cf. Fig. 9). Consequently,
each site of the potential lattice will now become a time-
dependent double-well potential.

system is much more sensitive to speciﬁc parameter val-
ues than the one-dimensional system. Another diﬀerence
is the fact that we can apply the time-dependent shift
to the potentials V1 and V2 only in one direction [24].
Thus the possible excited state outcomes of the processes
have excited vibrational states in that particular direc-
tion only. For optical lattice conﬁgurations that opens
interesting possibilities. For example, one can shift the
potentials in y direction in the ﬁrst process and then take
the ﬁnal state of that as the initial state of another pro-
cess where the roles of y and x are reversed.

IV. APPLICATION TO A MODULATED
LATTICE

Let the wavelengths of the potentials be λi in scaled

units. Then the respective potentials are

A. The basic idea

The preceding model discussed so far originates from a
three-state model and therefore inherits a somewhat un-
intuitive parameterization by pulse strengths and detun-
ings. The actual geometry of the double-well potential is
given as a solution of a third degree polynomial result-
ing from an eigenvalue calculation of the matrix given in
Eq. (2). The solution cannot be simpliﬁed into any illus-
trative and compact form in terms of the control param-
eters, which is also why it is not given explicitly in the
text, and mainly qualitative characterizations could be
given in Sec. III C. Nevertheless, the previously derived
one-state model is adequate for presenting the general be-
haviour of wavepacket dynamics in time-dependent dou-
ble wells. Therefore, the results do not depend on the
actual formulation of the underlying potential.

We now move on to seek alternative realizations for
the double-well potential. The main focus is to make the
control of the potential as self-explanatory as possible.
Another point of interest is to introduce a method which
could be also experimentally accessible.

The previous dynamics included typically two sets of

V (x) = V0 sin2(2πx/λV ),

W (x, t) = W0 sin2{2π[x − x0(t)]/λW },
U (x, t) = V (x) + W (x, t),

(10a)
(10b)
(10c)

where λV = 2λW and x0(t) describes the oﬀ-set of W
with respect to V . The initial position is chosen such that
the minima of both V and W coincide, i.e., x0(0) = 0.
Furthermore, approximately V0 ≈ 2W0 is needed.

The scaling is chosen as previously with an added as-
sumption that λV = 2λW = 40. Accordingly, the recoil
energies Ei
i ) of the lattice ﬁelds be-
recoil = π2/100 in the scaled
come EV
units.

recoil = 4π2~2/(2mλ2
recoil = π2/400 and EW

For simplicity, let us consider only one lattice site lo-
cated initially at x = 0. At ﬁrst, the wavepacket is at rest
at the bottom of the well. Thereafter, the W potential
sweeps one half of its wavelength to the right. Mean-
while, the wavepacket gets driven uphill by the moving
potential barrier. However, since the barrier eﬀectively
becomes lower after having passed the x = 0 point, the
wavepacket will drop down to a vibrational state of a
newly created well around x = 0.

The point is that from the perspective of the ini-
tial ground state there will be only one set of energy

level crossings during the period, when the wavepacket is
driven upwards in a local minimum, while a new global
minimum is deepened on the other side of the barrier.
The energy gaps in these crossings increase with the cor-
responding vibrational state number (cf. Fig. 10). There-
fore, the sweep rate τpot will determine which crossings
are passed diabatically, and which are followed adiabati-
cally.

as in Fig. 11, a superposition of the ﬁrst two excited states
(grey arrows) is achieved by passing the ﬁrst crossing diabati-
cally (black circle) and the second partially diabatically (grey
circle).

B. Numerical results

Sinusoidal potentials are relatively ﬂat and round if
compared to the LIP’s described in Sec. II. Therefore, the
corresponding double-well structure holds a set of eigen-
states, which do not represent eigenstates of individual
wells very well, but are spread over both wells instead.
Consequently, in case of the higher vibrational states the
energy level crossings are not as sharp as previously. Ac-
cordingly, the population is after the sweep likely to be
spread over a distribution of vibrational states, as the
population leaks gradually at each energy level crossing.
Alternatively, a high control over the sweep rate τpot(t)
is needed in order to slow down at the instant when adi-
abatic following during a crossing is wanted, and accel-
erate again thereafter in order to cross the other possible
gaps diabatically.

Figure 11 shows an example of the lattice evolution
corresponding to Fig. 10. The lattice oﬀ-set is evolved
linearly, i.e., x0(t) = t/τpot, where the constant sweep
rate is τpot = 104. A superposition of the ﬁrst two excited
vibrational states is populated accordingly. The above-
mentioned leaks in population to other vibrational states

The process of change is rather fast as expected, too.
Nevertheless, this example shows clearly that the ideas
developed for the three-state system with two pulses can
be carried over to the optical lattices.

V. DISCUSSION

We have investigated a transition from a counterin-
tuitively coupled three-state system into a single-state
system described by a time-dependent double-well po-
tential. Thereafter, we have shown how the populations
of the vibrational states in each well can be tailored by
modulations of this double-well potential.

The focus of our study was in investigation of neces-
sary diabatic crossings blended among otherwise adia-
batic following. The system holds basically three diﬀer-
ent timescales: i) the intrinsic vibrational timescale τvib
induced by potential geometry, ii) the general timescale
of the modulation of the potential surface τpot, and iii) a
set of timescales associated with the crossings of the LIP
eigenstates n ∈ N with their upper neighbours {τ n
cross}.
Firstly, τvib ≪ τpot is needed in order to have adiabatic
following in general. Secondly, the tailoring of the state
populations is done by adjusting the set {τ n
cross} with re-
spect to τvib such that certain energy gaps are crossed di-
abatically while the others are avoided adiabatically. The
values of τ n
cross are ultimately determined by the way the
potential geometry is modiﬁed, but τpot scales the over-
all timescale of the process. Therefore, the adjustment
of crossing timescales can be made by tuning either the
potential parameters or the general timescale τpot.

In this general model survey we have used scaled units
rather than taking a speciﬁc physical system with ﬁxed

parameters. This was done intentionally in order to fo-
cus on describing the model itself. In practice, we expect
that the results can be applied in various systems. A
recent example is an optical lattice setup where one gen-
erates a periodic two-dimensional lattice of double-well
structures, with controllable barrier heights and relative
well depths [25].

Another interesting situation arises when we consider
our model from the viewpoint of a moving atom in an
atom chip waveguide [26]. The position in our descrip-
tion can be considered as the transverse direction of the
waveguide, and the time evolution corresponds to the
change in the potential seen by the atom during its mo-
tion in the longitudinal direction. Our model can then
describe a controlled transfer process between two waveg-
uides, with the additional possibility of exciting tranverse

9

modes.

Our future investigations will consider the role of inter-
actions in this process. The simplest system to study is
a zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate. The inter-
actions cause the LIP eigenstate structure to depend on
the momentary local density and this back-action needs
to be taken into account. Also, in two dimensions it will
remove the separability of the coordinates.

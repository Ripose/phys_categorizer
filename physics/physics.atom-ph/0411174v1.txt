The higher order Cn dispersion coeﬃcients for
the alkali atoms.

The van der Waals coeﬃcients, from C11 through to C16 resulting from 2nd, 3rd and 4th order
perturbation theory are estimated for the alkali (Li, Na, K and Rb) atoms. The dispersion co-
eﬃcients are also computed for all possible combinations of the alkali atoms and hydrogen. The
parameters are determined from sum-rules after diagonalizing the ﬁxed core Hamiltonian in a large
basis. Comparisons of the radial dependence of the Cn/rn potentials give guidance as to the radial
regions in which the various higher-order terms can be neglected. It is seen that including terms up
to C10/r10 results in a dispersion interaction that is accurate to better than 1% whenever the inter-
nuclear spacing is larger than 20 a0. This level of accuracy is mainly achieved due to the fortuitous
cancellation between the repulsive (C11, C13, C15) and attractive (C12, C14, C16) dispersion forces.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The experimental realization of Bose-Einstein conden-
sation (BEC) for the alkali atoms, Li, Na, Rb and atomic
hydrogen [1, 2] has resulted in an upsurge of interest in
the area of cold atom physics. One consequence of this is
the increased importance in determining the interaction
potentials between alkali and alkaline-earth atoms. For
example, the stability and structure of BECs depends on
the sign (and magnitude) of the scattering length, and
the scattering length sensitively on the ﬁne details of the
interaction potential [3, 4].

One can try and determine the interaction potential by
either explicit calculation [5, 6, 7], or by analysis of high
precision spectroscopic experiments of the dimer [8, 9,
10]. These approaches are most suited to determining the
potential at small to intermediate values of internuclear
distance (e.g. r < 25 a0). At large distances, one relies
on the approach pioneered by Dalgarno and collaborators
[11, 12, 13], namely using oscillator strength sum rules
to determine the so-called dispersion coeﬃcients.

The long-range interaction between two spherically

symmetric atoms can be written in the general form

V (r → ∞) = −V6(r)−V8(r)−V10(r)−V11(r)−V12(r)−. . . ,
(1)
where the dispersion potential, Vn(r) of order n is written

Vn(r) =

Cn
rn .

(2)

The Cn parameters are the van der Waals dispersion co-
eﬃcients. The even (n = 6, 8, . . .) dispersion coeﬃcients
are calculated using oscillator-strength sum rules derived
from 2nd-order perturbation theory and provide an at-
tractive interaction. The odd (n = 11, 13, . . .) terms

∗Electronic address: jxm107@rsphysse.anu.edu.au
†Electronic address: mbromley@cdu.edu.au

come from 3rd-order perturbation theory, and are re-
pulsive [14]. Contributions from 4th-order perturbation
theory start at n = 12 [14, 15]. The calculations were
stopped at n = 16 since the contributions from 5th and
6th-order perturbation theory start at n = 17 and n = 18
respectively.

It has been customary in previous systematic studies of
dispersion coeﬃcients to restrict the calculations to just
the C6, C8 and C10 terms [16]. With the recent inter-
est in determining the scattering lengths of A-A systems
to high precision [4, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20], it is now worth-
while to evaluate the higher n dispersion coeﬃcients with
a view to determining whether these make a signiﬁcant
contribution to the inter-atomic potential for those radial
separations at which the long-range form of the potential
is ﬁrst applied.

The recent spectrum analyses have typically an inter-
nuclear distance of about 20 a0 as the boundary point
used to join the explicitly determined potential with the
asymptotic form given in terms of the dispersion forces [8,
9, 10]. Taking the Rb-Rb potential as a speciﬁc example,
explicit calculations have shown that C6 = 4.635 × 103
au, C8 = 5.701 × 105 au, C10 = 7.916 × 107 au, and
C12 = 1.427 × 1010 au [21]. At a radius of 20 a0 the
ratios of the contributions from the various terms are 1 :
0.308 : 0.1068 : 0.0481. The contribution of the highest
multipole potential is about 5% of the dipole-dipole C6
term.

In this article, the C11 to C16 dispersion coeﬃcients
and related parameters are computed using a semi-
empirical approach for the alkali atoms. The method
adopted utilizes oscillator strengths calculated within a
semi-empirical framework [21]. Comparisons with previ-
ous high accuracy ab-initio calculations [21, 22, 23, 24,
25] of the C6, C8 and C10 dispersion coeﬃcients suggests
the method is able to generate coeﬃcients that are accu-
rate to about 1-2%.

II. CALCULATION OF THE DISPERSION
PARAMETERS

All the dispersion coeﬃcients computed in this paper
were computed by ﬁrst diagonalizing the semi-empirical
Hamiltonian in a large mixed Laguerre type orbital or
Slater type orbital basis set. Next various sum rules in-
volving oscillator strengths or reduced matrix elements
were summed over the set of physical and pseudo states.
The respective formulae for the various coeﬃcients are
now given. The notation Cn is used to denote the total
dispersion coeﬃcient for a given n. So for n ≥ 12, Cn
is the sum of C(2)
n arises from 2nd-
n
order perturbation theory and C(4)
n arises from 4th-order
perturbation theory.

A. The 2nd order contributions to C12 and C14

While the higher n dispersion coeﬃcients for the
H-H system have been determined to high precision
[26, 27, 28], only a few calculations of C12 and C14 have
been done for the alkali atoms [14, 29]. The calculations
of Ovsiannikov, Guilyarovski and Lopatko (OGL) [14, 26]
used an approximate expression for the Greens function
and can only be expected to be accurate at the 20% level.
Explicit comparisons with the C8 and C10 values of Patil
and Tang (PT) [29] in references [21, 25] reveal discrep-
ancies of order 10% for Na2, K2 and Rb2. Recursion rules
exist for estimating Cn at high n from data tabulations
of Cn for lower values of n [27].

The polarization and dispersion parameters can be
computed from their respective oscillator strength sum-
rules which are well known. The oscillator strength, f (ℓ)
0i
from the ground state (with orbital and spin angular mo-
mentum equal zero) to the ith excited state is deﬁned as

f (ℓ)
0i =

2|hψ0 k rℓCℓ(ˆr) k ψii|2ǫ0i
(2ℓ + 1)

.

(3)

In this expression Cℓ is the spherical tensor of rank ℓ, the
Wigner-Eckart theorem is deﬁned according to [30], and
ǫ0i is the excitation energy of the transition. The sum
rule for the adiabatic multipole polarizability, α(ℓ) is

α(ℓ) = X

with ℓi + ℓj + 1 = n. The sum rules are a generalized sum
which implicitly includes a sum over excitations to bound
states and an integration taking into account excitations
to continuum states.

The sum rules involve contributions from both core
and valence excitations. The valence contributions were
evaluated by diagonalizing the model Hamiltonian in a
very large basis. Determination of the f -value distribu-
tion for the core was handled by using the properties of
f -value sum rules and an approach that gives a reason-
able estimate of the f -value distribution with a minimum
of computation [21]. We use the sum-rule for the polar-
izability, eq. (4) and

ℓN hr2ℓ−2i = X

[21, 31] to estimate an f (ℓ)-value distribution function of
reasonable accuracy. This expression reduces to the well
known Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule for ℓ = 1, viz

N = X
i

f (1)
i = S(1)(0) .

(7)

In these expressions N is the total number of electrons
and hr2ℓ−2i is an expectation value of the ground state
wave function.

The core f (l)-value distribution was determined by
assuming each closed sub-shell made a contribution of
Nir2ℓ−2
to the sum-rules, where Ni the number of elec-
i
trons in the sub-shell and r2ℓ−2
is the hr2ℓ−2i Hartree-
i
Fock (HF) expectation value. Next, the excitation energy
for each sub-shell is set to the HF single particle, ǫi plus
an energy shift. The energy shift, ∆(ℓ) was set by using
the core multipole polarizability, α(ℓ)
core and the relation

α(ℓ)

core = X

(ǫi + ∆(ℓ))2 .

(8)

A full description of the details and core polarizabilities
used to ﬁx ∆(ℓ) for ℓ = 1, 2 and 3 has been published [21].
The contribution from the core was omitted for ℓ = 4 and
5 since there are no reliable estimates of these core po-
larizabilities and the ℓr(2ℓ−2)
weighting factors lead to
the core becoming less important for larger ℓ. The core
contribution to α(3) was less than 0.2% for Rb and most
of the core contribution to C(2)
2n comes from the f (1) dis-
tribution.

B. The 3rd order and 4th order potentials

The dispersion coeﬃcients, C11 and C13, arise from
3rd-order perturbation theory [13, 14, 15, 26, 28, 32].
The standard expressions are expressed in terms of sums
of products of reduced matrix elements. The expressions
derived by OGL [14, 26] are used. Given the complexity
of the expressions, it is not surprising there have been
relatively few calculations of these coeﬃcients for any
atoms. Accurate values for C11 through to C31 for the
H-H system have recently been published [26, 28].

For the alkali atoms, the only estimates of C11 have
been obtained from the relatively small calculations of

OGL [14] and Patil and Tang [29]. There have been
some C11 and C12 estimates for Cs [33], but that atom is
deemed too heavy to accurately describe with the present
non-relativistic method and is not discussed any further
here.

The dispersion coeﬃcients, C12 and C14, both have
contributions that arise from 4th-order perturbation the-
ory. However, there have been very few calculations of
the 4th order term for any systems. Bukta and Meath
[15] made an explicit calculation C(4)
12 for the H-H dimer.
Besides deriving a general expression OGL [14, 26] also
made some estimates of C(4)
12 for combinations of hydro-
gen and the alkali atoms. Finally, the present authors
made a comprehensive calculation of C(4)
n up to n = 32
for the H-H interaction [26] using the OGL formalism.

Although the core has not been taken explicitly into
account in the evaluation of the 3rd and higher order dis-
persion parameters their impact is expected to be smaller
than 2nd order due since the 3rd and 4th order sum-rules
have an energy denominator involving the square or cube
of the excitation energy.

III. RESULTS OF THE CALCULATION

A. Sensitivity of calculations to the ground state
wave function

12 , C(2)

14 and C(2)

One aspect of the calculations that warrants particular
mention was the sensitivity of the higher-ℓ polarizabili-
ties (listed in Table I) and thus C(2)
16 to the
representation of the ground state wave function. While
there are many advantages to representing the wave func-
tion with a linear combination of convenient basis func-
tions, there are some negative features. One of those neg-
ative features relates to the behavior at large distances
from the nucleus. Unlike a grid based calculation, the
correct asymptotics are not imposed and so the large-r
part of the wave function, which has a weak inﬂuence on
the total binding energy can be inaccurate.

This is best illustrated by a speciﬁc calculation. Our
initial calculations for the α(4) and α(5) polarizibilities Na
used a 3s wave function written as a linear combination
of 12 Slater type orbitals (STOs). This wave function had
a binding energy against ionization of 0.1888532 hartree.

3

The resulting polarizabilities were α(4) = 3.46 × 106 au
and α(5) = 6.42 × 108 au. When the STO basis was
replaced by a large Laguerre type orbital (LTO) basis
(this was necessary for the evaluation of C11) and the
energy driven to convergence the resulting binding en-
ergy was 0.1888549 hartree. However there were dra-
matic changes in the polarizabilities, with the new val-
ues being α(4) = 2.97 × 106 au and α(5) = 2.45 × 108 au
(refer to Table I). The polarizability α(5) decreased by
a factor of about 2.5 when the binding energy changed
by 1.7 × 10−6 hartree! The dispersion parameters, C(2)
12
and C(4)
12 and were also sensitive to the representation
of the ground state wave function. The initial C(2)
14 of
4.04 × 1011 a.u. was decreased to 2.602 × 1011 a.u. when
the ground state basis was made exhaustively large. The
impact of the basis set on the dispersion coeﬃcients was
was not so extreme as for the polarizability but was still
substantial.

The f (2) and f (3) distributions used in earlier calcu-
lations of the Na and K polarizabilities and dispersion
coeﬃcients [21, 34] were aﬀected to a smaller extent by
this problem. The octupole polarizabilities were 3-4%
too large for these atoms, while the eﬀect upon C10 was
to make them about 1-2% too large. The impact upon
α(2) and C8 was an order of magnitude smaller but it
was still discernible [26]. Where values of C8 and C10 are
required in the present work, the revised values [35] are
used.

B. The homo-nuclear Alkali-Alkali systems

The results of the present calculations for the Li, Na,
K and Rb homo-nuclear alkali atom pairs are listed in
Tables I and II, and compared with the calculations of
Ovsiannikov et al [14] and Patil and Tang [29].

All of the present values of C(2)

12 are larger than the PT
and OGL estimates by amounts ranging from 10-50%.
This is not a concern since the OGL and PT estimates
of C6, C8 and C10 are also smaller than the latest data
for these parameters [21, 24, 25]. The present estimates
of C11 and C13 are also 10-50% larger than the PT and
OGL estimates.

n and C(4)

In Table II, C(2)

n are given as separate entries.
The total dispersion parameter Cn is given in Table IV
which tabulates the dispersion parameters for all possible
atom-atom combinations. The 4th-order terms, C(4)
12 are
about 4-5% the size of C(2)
12 . The 4th-order correction
to C12 is about the same size as the correction due to
the core. The size of the 4th-order correction to C14 is
larger, with about 25% of the ﬁnal value of C14 coming
from C(4)
12 . For C16, the 4th-order terms are almost as
large as the 2nd-order terms, with C(4)
16 being 80% the
size of C(2)

16 for K2 and Rb2.

The contribution of the core to C(2)

16 is
relatively small. The contribution is largest for the Rb2

C. Critical radius for dispersion formula

The LeRoy radius is often used as an estimate of the
critical radius beyond which the interaction can be de-
scribed by the use of a dispersion formula [36, 37]. It is
deﬁned for two atoms, A and B as

RLR = 2(cid:0)phr2iA + phr2iB(cid:1) ,
where hr2iA is evaluated for the ground state. The LeRoy
radius for the homo-nuclear dimers are given in Table III.
We introduce some parameters so that the range of
validity of the dispersion formula can be discussed in a
quantitative manner. First, the partial sum of the dis-
persion energy up to the nth term is deﬁned as

(9)

Wn(r) =

Vm(r) .

(10)

m=n

X
m=6

One would then consider the relative size of Wn(r) to
W∞(r) as a measure of the accuracy of the truncated
dispersion potential to the exact potential. There are of
course problems associated with the evaluation of W∞,
and so we identify W∞(r) with W16(r). It is natural to
stop the analysis at n = 16 since the contributions from
5th and 6th-order perturbation theory start at n = 17
and n = 18 respectively.

Figure 1 shows the ratio |W10(r) − W16(r)|/|W16(r)| as
a function of r for the Li, Na, K and Rb dimers. This ra-
tio is seen to be smaller than 1% for all values of r greater

than 20 a0. The curves for Li2 and Na2 are very simi-
lar, as are the curves for K2 and Rb2. The existence of
two sets of two very similar curves is probably related to
the fact that the lowest lying d-excitations for Li and Na
involve a change in principal quantum number whereas
those for K and Rb do not.

There is a sign change in (W10(r) − W16(r)) near 20 a0
for all four dimers. The magnitude of W10(r) is generally
smaller than W16(r) for small separations, but for large
separations W10(r) is generally larger in magnitude than
W16(r). This is caused by the repulsive V11(r), V13(r)
and V15(r) interactions.

A useful way to parameterize this information is to
deﬁne Rn such that it gives the smallest radius for which
the partial dispersion energy Wn(r) is accurate to 1%. In
eﬀect, Rn is the largest r solution of the equation

|Wn(r) − W16(r)| = 0.010 × W16(r) n ≤ 16

(11)

Table III gives Rn for the hydrogen and alkali homo-
nuclear dimers. The values of Rn get larger as the atom
gets heavier. A dispersion potential only involving C6

would not be accurate to 1% until the separation dis-
tance increased to more than 100 a0 in the case of Rb2.
This distance shrinks dramatically with the inclusion of
the V8 and V10 potentials. The size of R8 indicates that
a dispersion interaction with only V6 and V8 is not good
enough to describe these alkali dimers. The R10 parame-
ter is smaller than the LeRoy radius for all systems, and
so the use of W10(r) will be accurate to better than 1% as
long as the internuclear separation is greater than RLR.
Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 show the ratio |Vn(r)|/|W16(r)| as
a function of r for all the alkali dimers. One of the most
noticeable features of these curves is the existence of a
nexus point for the V11, V13, V14, V15 and V16 potentials
between 16-21 a0 for all alkali dimers. This suggests that
a recursion relation of the type Cn+m = AmCn exists
between the respective dispersion coeﬃcients.

The biggest correction to W10(r) for suﬃciently large
r should be V11(r). The C12:C11 ratios for Li2, Na2,
K2 and Rb2 from Table IV are 23.3, 25.7, 26.2 and 27.9
respectively and, for, r less than these values it is actually
V12(r) which is the largest correction to W10(r) (note; at
suﬃciently small r, V13, V14, . . . will also be larger than
V11).

The extent to which mutual cancellations act to mini-
mize the error can be gauged by adding the magnitudes
16
of Vn(r) at r = 20. For Na, the P
n=11 |Vn(r)| is equal
to 0.047 × W16(r) at r = 20a0. But, the partial sum
|W10(r) − W16(r)| is equal to 0.0012 × W16(r) at this
radius. The alternating signs reduce the impact of the
higher order terms by a factor of about 40. For Rb,
16
the P
n=11 |Vn(r)| sum gives 0.168 × W16(r) at r = 20
a0. The magnitudes of |Vn(r)|/|W10(r)| are greater than
0.025 for all n between 11 and 16. The partial sum
|W10(r) − W16(r)| is equal to 0.0071 × W16(r) at this
radius. In this case, the alternating signs have reduced
the impact of the higher order terms by a factor of more
than 20.

Figures 6 and 7 better illustrate the extent to which
mutual cancellations result in W10 being a very good ap-
proximation to the total dispersion potential for Na and
Rb. The combination (V11(r) + V12(r)) is much smaller
than either V11 or V12, and similarly (V13(r) + V14(r))
is smaller than V13 or V14 while (V15(r) + V16(r)) is
smaller than V15(r) or V16(r). The combination of
V2n−1(r) + V2n(r) falls to 1% of W16(r) about 5-10 a0
closer to the origin than either V2n−1(r) or V2n(r).

1. The Rubidium dimer

A recent analysis of three complementary experiments
by van Kempen et al [9] for the Rb2 dimer resulted in
experimental estimates of the dispersion parameters C6,
C8, C10 and C11 and gave estimates of the scattering
length to a precision of about 1% for Rb87.

The present work suggests that their estimates of C6,
C8 and C10 may be well founded and our previous cal-
culations agreed with the experimental values to an ac-

curacy of 2% [21]. However, it is probable that their
attempt to determine C11 was overly ambitious. The
present calculation gave C11 = −5.362 × 109 au which
lies outside the van Kempen estimate of C11 = (−8.6 ±
0.17)×109 au. We believe this diﬀerence is a consequence
of assumptions made by van Kempen et al when they
performed the ﬁt to extract the dispersion coeﬃcient.

First, their least squares ﬁt relied on a value of C12 of
1.19 × 1010 au computed by Patil and Tang [38]. This
estimate of C12 is about 25% smaller than the present
2nd plus 4th order C12 of 1.496 × 1010 au. Second, their
estimate is derived from the energies of bound states that
have an outer turning radius of about 20 a0. At this ra-
dius, V12 is actually larger than V11. Furthermore, the
higher order terms, V13, V14, V15 and V16 were all slightly
larger than V11 at a radius of 20 a0! However, as has
been noted, the alternating signs of the successive terms
results in a considerable degree of cancellation. Never-
theless, one can conclude that the van Kempen estimate
of C11 is sensitive to the accuracy and presence of the
high n terms in the dispersion interaction.

The n > 10 dispersion parameters for all possible com-
binations of H, Li, Na, K and Rb are given in Table IV.
The radial matrix elements for hydrogen were those of
the N = 15 calculation used in an earlier calculation of
the H-H dispersion parameters [26]. The C11 and C12 pa-
rameters reported by OGL [14] and PT [29] are not listed
since the present calculations are more sophisticated.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The complete set of dispersion parameters up to n = 16
has been computed for all combinations of hydrogen and

the alkali atoms up to rubidium. The relative importance
of the dispersion potentials Vn(r) increases as the atoms
get heavier. It was found that the dispersion energy given
by the ﬁrst 3 terms of eq. (1) is accurate to 1% whenever
R > 20 a0. This degree of accuracy at relatively small
internuclear separations comes from a fortuitous cancel-
lation between the terms with n > 10 in the dispersion
energy. The 3rd-order potentials, V11, V13 and V15 are

repulsive, while the even terms, V12, V14 and V16 are at-
tractive. The 4th-order contribution to C16 was almost
as large as the 2nd-order contribution to C16.

Whether terms in the dispersion interaction with n >
10 are important in the description of alkali dimers is
essentially a question about whether the dispersion in-
teraction has to be known to a precision of 1.0% or 0.1%.
It is clear that additional terms going beyond C10 should

be introduced in pairs. There is no point in including
the V11 potential without also including the V12 poten-
tial. Indeed, inclusion of just one member of the (V11,V12)
would most likely degrade rather than improve the ac-
curacy of the dispersion potential. Given that the C6
parameter has been calculated to a precision of better
than 1% for most alkali systems [21, 24, 25], usage of a
dispersion interaction involving the (V11, V12) potentials
may be warranted.

There have been a couple of experimental investiga-
tions of alkali-dimer potentials that have included dis-
persion forces with n > 10. The value of C11 for the
Rb dimer has been given by van Kempen et al [9]. How-
ever, this value of C11 is most likely model dependent

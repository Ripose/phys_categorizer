Abstract

We have successfully loaded a magneto-optic trap for Yb atoms from a thermal source

without the use of a Zeeman slower. The source is placed close to the trapping region

so that it provides a large ﬂux of atoms that can be cooled and captured. The atoms

are cooled on the 1S0 ↔ 1P1 transition at 398.8 nm. We have loaded all seven stable

isotopes of Yb into the trap. For the most abundant isotope (174Yb), we load more

than 107 atoms into the trap within 1 s. For the rarest isotope (168Yb) with a natural

abundance of only 0.13%, we still load about 4 × 105 atoms into the trap. We ﬁnd

that the trap population is maximized near a detuning of −1.5Γ and ﬁeld gradient

of 75 G/cm.

1. Introduction

Laser-cooled atoms open exciting new possibilities for several experiments including those in

precision spectroscopy. Yb is a particularly good choice for such studies because of several

reasons. Yb has been proposed for experiments in quantum optics1,2 due to the existence of

two nearly-closed low-lying excited states with widely diﬀering lifetimes. Laser-cooled Yb

has been proposed for optical frequency standards applications3. Yb has been shown to be a

useful candidate for the test of electroweak interactions because there is an enhanced parity-

violation eﬀect in the 1S0 ↔ 3D1 transition4. Laser-cooled Yb extends the possibilities in

measuring the strength of parity-violating interactions with unprecedented accuracy due to

the availability of dense samples where one can apply large electric ﬁelds and homogeneous

magnetic ﬁelds. Furthermore, Yb has a wide range of stable isotopes, both fermionic and

bosonic, allowing one to explore the possibility of studying the properties of fermion-boson

mixtures5,6.

The starting point of most laser-cooling experiments is the magneto-optic trap (MOT)7.

The source of atoms for the MOT is usually an oven inside the vacuum chamber containing

a small amount of pure metal which is heated to release a beam of atoms. For atoms with

high melting point such as Na, the hot atoms emanating from the oven are ﬁrst slowed by

a counter-propagating laser beam (Zeeman slower or chirp slower). Yb has a melting point

of 819◦C and previous experiments have used a Zeeman slower for loading the MOT8,9.

However, we have earlier shown that a MOT for Rb atoms can be loaded eﬃciently from a

thermal getter source operating at temperatures near 300◦C without the use of a slower10.

Since Yb has considerable vapor pressure over the solid at 300◦C, we have been exploring

the possibility of loading a Yb MOT directly from a thermal source.

In this paper, we show that this is indeed possible by successfully loading all the seven

stable isotopes of Yb into the MOT from a thermal source. For the most abundant isotope

(174Yb), we load about 1.7 × 107 atoms with a time constant of 190 ms. Most signiﬁcantly,

we can trap the rarest isotope (168Yb) which has a natural abundance of only 0.13%. There

are two factors that make this possible. The ﬁrst is that the oven is placed close to the

trapping region so that it provides a large ﬂux of atoms that can be captured by the MOT.

The second factor is that the excited state lifetime of the cooling transition is only 5.68

ns and the photon scattering rate is very high. Atoms are slowed over a short distance

and small laser beams of 10 mm diameter are enough to cool and capture atoms from the

background vapor.

2

2. Experimental details

Yb has two possible cooling transitions, as seen from the energy level diagram in Fig. 1. The

1S0 ↔ 3P1 intercombination line at 555.8 nm forms a pure two-level system in Yb due to

the absence of ground-state hyperﬁne structure. The transition has a long lifetime of 874 ns

corresponding to a natural linewidth of Γ = 2π × 182 kHz, and therefore the photon cycling

rate is very slow. However, the Doppler cooling limit is 4 µK, a very desirable temperature

for high-precision measurements. The other cooling transition is the 1S0 ↔ 1P1 transition at

398.9 nm. This has a short lifetime of 5.68 ns or a linewidth of Γ = 2π × 28 MHz, and allows

photons to be cycled quickly. However, it has the disadvantage of giving a high Doppler

cooling limit of 670 µK, and is not a completely closed transition since the excited state

can branch into the low-lying 3P levels through the intermediate 3D levels. Despite these

disadvantages, we have decided to use the 398.9 nm transition for our experiments primarily

because the high photon scattering rate allows atoms to be cooled over a short distance.

The laser light for the 398.9 nm transition is produced in a two-step process. First, the

output of a tunable Ti-sapphire laser (Coherent 899-21) is set to half the desired frequency

near 798 nm. Then its output is fed into an external-cavity frequency-doubling unit (Laser

Analytical Systems, LAS100) which uses a nonlinear crystal of lithium triborate to produce

the desired 398.8 nm light. The Ti-sapphire laser is actively stabilized using an ovenized,

Fabry-Perot reference cavity and its instantaneous linewidth is less than 1 MHz. We have

also measured that its long-term drift is only a few MHz per hour, which makes it unnec-

essary to lock the laser to an external reference. For our experiments, we ﬁnd that it is

suﬃcient to set the frequency at the desired point and leave it for the duration of the exper-

iment. The frequency is set using a home-built wavemeter11 that uses a scanning Michelson

interferometer and a Rb-stabilized reference laser. The wavemeter has an absolute accuracy

of a few MHz which is more than suﬃcient for ﬁnding the Yb lines. Once the trap is working,

the trap ﬂuorescence signal is used to optimize the laser frequency or detuning.

The experiments are done inside a vacuum chamber consisting of a standard six-way cross

3

made of pyrex with 25-mm O.D. windows. The pyrex cell is pumped by a 20 l/s ion pump

and maintained at a pressure below 10−9 torr. The source of Yb atoms is a quartz ampoule

containing a small amount of elemental Yb. The ampoule is a 30 mm long tube of 5 mm

diameter that is sealed at one end and constricted to 1 mm diameter at the other end. The

constriction seems important both in ensuring a uniform ﬂux in the trapping volume and

in preventing the walls from getting coated with a ﬁlm of Yb. Using a collimated thermal

beam, as is the case when using a Zeeman slower, causes the opposite wall to get rapidly

coated with a thick ﬁlm of Yb. On the other hand, we ﬁnd no such deposit even after 50

hours of operation of the source. The source is placed about 50 mm from the trap center.

It is resistively heated to a temperature of 300–400◦C to release Yb.

The MOT is formed from a standard conﬁguration consisting of three pairs of mutually

orthogonal laser beams and a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld superposed at the intersection of

the beams. The total laser power available near the MOT is 90 mW. This is split into three

circularly-polarized beams. Each beam has a power of 30 mW and diameter of 10 mm.

The saturation intensity I0 for the transition is 58 mW/cm2, therefore the intensity in the

beams is about 0.65I0. The beams are retroreﬂected after passing through the cell, and the

intensity in the return beams is slightly smaller due to losses along the optical path. The

quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld is produced using a pair of coils (270 turns each) placed 40 mm

apart. With 3 A of current through the coils, the ﬁeld gradient at the center is 90 G/cm.

There is negligible heat generation in the coils at this current. The ﬂuorescence from the

trapped atoms is imaged on to a calibrated photo-multiplier tube (PMT). The number of

trapped atoms is estimated from the total power incident on the PMT after accounting for

losses along the optical path10. There is an error of about 20% in estimating the number

of atoms in this manner, but relative values between isotopes and other such trends are

unaﬀected by this error.

3. Results and discussion

In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we scanned the laser slowly across a frequency range of 3

GHz. The ﬂuorescence signal detected by the PMT is shown in Fig. 2. The signal shows

peaks as each isotope comes into resonance and gets trapped in the MOT. The peak heights

correspond roughly to the natural abundance of each isotope except for the odd isotopes

which show anomalous behavior. This is because the odd isotopes have half-integer nuclear

spin and consequently have hyperﬁne structure in the 1P1 excited state.

In these cases,

optical pumping into the wrong hyperﬁne level causes additional loss from the trap. The

signal from the rarest isotope 168Yb is also seen in the ﬁgure. As shown in the inset of Fig.

2, the 168Yb peak becomes clearer when the gain of the PMT is increased by a factor of 100.

In order to better characterize the source and ﬁnd optimal values for the laser detuning,

we have studied the trap population as a function of laser frequency. The laser was scanned

slowly over a frequency range of 100 MHz below the resonance. The results for 174Yb are

shown in Fig. 3. The number of trapped atoms shows a peak value of 1.7 × 107 at a detuning

of −1.5Γ. This is similar to the behavior seen in the case of a Rb MOT loaded from a thermal

source10. Note that the optimal value of detuning depends on the size of the trapping beams

and the magnetic-ﬁeld gradient, since both these parameters are important in determining

the distance over which atoms are slowed and captured. The data in Fig. 3 were taken with

a magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 75 G/cm. All the other isotopes show similar dependence on

detuning.

The loading of the MOT from a thermal source follows a rate equation10

where N is the number of atoms in the trap, R is the rate at which atoms are captured from

the source, and τ represents the losses from the trap. In the case of Yb, there are several

factors that contribute to the loss rate. The dominant mechanism is collisional losses, both

due to collisions with background atoms and collisions with hot, untrapped Yb atoms. In

(1)

addition, as mentioned before, the 1P1 excited state of the cooling transition can branch

into the low-lying 3P levels. Of these, the 3P0 and 3P2 levels are metastable levels; atoms

shelved into these levels no longer participate in the cooling cycle and are rapidly lost from

the trap9.

We have studied the loss mechanisms in the trap by studying the loading characteristics

of the MOT for the diﬀerent isotopes. The solution to the rate equation in Eq. 1 is an

exponential growth in the number of trapped atoms: N = Ns[1−exp(−t/τ )], where Ns is the

steady state population and is given by Rτ . The loading characteristics of the most abundant

isotope 174Yb and the least abundant isotope 168Yb are shown in Fig. 4. Both curves follow

the exponential behaviour predicted from Eq. 1. Deviation from the exponential curve would

indicate other loss meachnisms. For example, losses due to collisions between trapped atoms

would appear as an N 2 term in Eq. 112. Under our conditions, such intra-trap collisional

loss does not seem signiﬁcant. From Fig. 4, we see that for 174Yb the time constant is 190

ms and the steady state population is 1.3 × 107. For 168Yb, the time constant is 440 ms

while the steady state population is about 40 times smaller. We should also mention that

the optimal value of magnetic-ﬁeld gradient for trapping 174Yb and 168Yb are diﬀerent, with

values of 75 G/cm and 60 G/cm, respectively.

The characteristics of the source and the loss mechanisms become more apparent by

studying the values of τ and Ns for the diﬀerent isotopes under identical conditions. The

measured values are listed in Table 1. The data were taken at a detuning of −1.2Γ and ﬁeld

gradient of 75 G/cm. The value of τ for the diﬀerent isotopes lies in that range of 160–450

ms, while Ns varies from 3 × 106 to 1.3 × 107. The general trend is that τ decreases and

Ns increases with the natural abundance of the isotope, except for the odd isotopes which,

as mentioned before, show anomalous behavior due to optical pumping in the excited-state

hyperﬁne levels. The trends become clearer if we consider the values for the loading rate

and Ns for each isotope normalized to the corresponding value for 174Yb, as listed in Table

2. For the even isotopes, the loading rate scales as the natural abundance, as expected from

a non-enriched source. On the other hand, the value of Ns scales roughly as the square root

6

of the natural abundance, implying that τ is inversely proportional to the square root of

the abundance. One possible explanation for this is that the cross-section for collisions with

same isotope atoms are larger than the cross-section for collisions with other isotopes.

4. Conclusions

We have successfully loaded a MOT for Yb atoms from a thermal source without the neces-

sity of a Zeeman slower. The source is placed close to the trapping region so that it provides

a large ﬂux of atoms that can be captured by the MOT. We have loaded all seven stable

isotopes of Yb. For the most abundant isotope (174Yb), we load about 2 × 107 atoms into

the trap within 1 s. Even for the rarest isotope (168Yb) with a natural abundance of only

0.13%, we load about 4 × 105 atoms into the trap. We have studied the trap population

as a function of laser detuning and ﬁnd that the population is maximized near a detuning

of −1.5Γ. We have characterized the losses from the trap by studying the loading of the

MOT as a function of time. We ﬁnd that the number of trapped atoms grows exponentially

with a time constant that scales as the inverse square root of the natural abundance of the

isotope. Trap losses due to optical pumping into the metastable 3P0 and 3P2 levels could

be a signiﬁcant limitation on the number of trapped atoms. In future, we plan to clear out

these levels using diode lasers at 649 nm (exciting the 3P0 → 3S1 transition) and at 770 nm

(exciting the 3P2 → 3S1 transition). With these improvements, we expect to get increased

population and lifetime in the trap which is important for many of the proposed experiments

using laser-cooled Yb.

various isotopes. The data for each isotope were taken at a detuning of −1.2Γ and ﬁeld gradient

of 75 G/cm. The errors in τ are statistical 1σ deviations. For Ns, there is a calibration error of

about 20% due to errors in converting the detected ﬂuorescence signal to the number of atoms.

However, the error is the same for all isotopes and does not aﬀect relative values.

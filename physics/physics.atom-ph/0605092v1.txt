Abstract. We present experimental results showing the diﬀuse reﬂection of a
Bose-Einstein condensate from a rough mirror, consisting of a dielectric substrate
supporting a blue-detuned evanescent wave. The scattering is anisotropic, more
pronounced in the direction of the surface propagation of the evanescent wave.
These results agree very well with theoretical predictions.

1. Introduction

The study of the interactions between ultra cold atoms and surfaces is of major interest
in the context of Bose-Einstein condensation on microchips [1, 2]. One motivation is to
understand the limitations on integrated matter wave devices due to imperfect surface
fabrication or ﬁnite temperature. For example, it has been shown that the quality
of the wires used in microfabricated chips is directly linked to the fragmentation
eﬀects observed in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped near a metallic wire
[3]. Moreover, the thermal ﬂuctuations of the current in a metallic surface induce spin
ﬂip losses in an atomic cloud when the distance to the surface is smaller than 10 µm
typically [4].

Dielectric surfaces and evanescent waves have also been explored for producing
strong conﬁnement. They have the advantage of a strong suppression of the spin
ﬂip loss mechanism compared to metallic structures [5]. With such a system, one can
realize mirrors [6], diﬀraction gratings [7], 2D traps [8] or waveguides [9]. Experiments
involving ultra cold atoms from a BEC at the vicinity of a dielectric surface have
recently made signiﬁcant progress, leading for instance to the realization of a two
dimensional BEC [10], to the study of atom-surface reﬂection in the quantum regime
[11], and to sensitive measurements of adsorbate-induced surface polarization [12] and
of the Van der Waals/Casimir-Polder surface interaction [13].

BEC diﬀuse reﬂection

In this paper, we present experimental results and a related theoretical analysis
of Bose condensed Rubidium atoms interacting with the light ﬁeld of an evanescent
wave above a dielectric slab. The evanescent wave is detuned to the blue of an atomic
transition line and provides a mirror for a BEC that is released from a trap and falls
freely in the gravity ﬁeld of the earth. After the bounce oﬀ the mirror, we observe
a strong scattering of the atomic cloud (diﬀuse mirror reﬂection) that is due to the
roughness of the slab surface where the evanescent wave is formed [14]. In fact, the
phase front of the reﬂected matter waves is signiﬁcantly distorted because the eﬀective
corrugation of the mirror is comparable to the incident de Broglie wavelength (a few
nm). We start by a presentation of the experiment and an analysis of the experimental
results, following Ref.[15]. We then discuss an improved theoretical analysis based
on the model developed by Henkel et al.
[16] and show that it gives quantitative
agreement with the data.

Figure 1. Dielectric prism supporting the evanescent wave. The surface is coated
by two layers of successively low and high refraction index to realize a wave guide
and enhance the evanescent ﬁeld. For each incident polarization, TE or TM,
coupling is resonant for a given incident angle. The experiments were performed
with TE polarization. One denotes x as the propagation axis of the evanescent
wave along the surface, y as the other horizontal axis and z as the vertical one.

The evanescent wave is produced by total internal reﬂection of a Gaussian laser
beam at the surface of a dielectric prism. As shown in Fig.1, the surface of the prism is
coated by two dielectric layers, a TiO2 layer on top of a SiO2 spacer layer. This coating
forms an optical waveguide that resonantly enhances the evanescent ﬁeld above the top
layer [17]; we have designed this conﬁguration for the study of two-dimensional atom
traps [18]. The incident angle of the laser beam is ﬁxed by the resonance condition for
a waveguide mode; for the transverse electric (or s) polarization we use, the incident
angle is θi = 46.1◦ (at the TiO2/vacuum interface, index nTiO2 = 1.86). The resulting
exponential decay length of the light ﬁeld is κ−1 = 93.8 nm, and I = I0 e−2κz is the
light intensity.

The mirror light is produced by a laser diode of power 40 mW detuned 1.5 GHz
above the atomic D2 line (λ = 780 nm or 1/λ = kL/2π = 12 820 cm−1). The Gaussian
beam is elliptical and produces on the surface a spot with 1/√e waist diameters of
220 µm along x and 85 µm along y (see coordinate axes in Fig.1). A measurement
of the reﬂection threshold for the atom beam, taking into account the van der Waals
attraction toward the surface (Landragin et al.
in Ref.[6]), gives access to the light
intensity at the surface in the spot center: I0 = 210 W/cm2.

3.1. Data

The experiment proceeds as follows: approximately 108 atoms are conﬁned in the
hyperﬁne ground state F = 2, mF = 2 in a Ioﬀe Pritchard (IP) type magnetic trap,
3.6 mm above the evanescent mirror [18]. The magnetic trap is cigar shaped, x
being its long axis. Oscillation frequencies are, respectively, ωx/2π = 21 Hz and
ω⊥/2π = 220 Hz in the radial directions (y and z). The atoms are evaporatively
105 atoms are released
cooled to below the condensation threshold and about N = 3
at t = 0 by switching oﬀ the magnetic trapping ﬁelds. These atoms reach the mirror
after free fall at treb = 27 ms and bounce on it with a velocity vi = 265 mm/s (de
Broglie wavelength λdB = 2π¯h/mvi = 17.3 nm). Around the bouncing time treb, the
mirror laser is switched on for ∆t = 2.2 ms. Limiting this time window ∆t prevents
near-resonant photon scattering during free fall or after reﬂection.

×

The atoms are detected by absorption imaging either before or after reﬂection.
During free fall, the cloud expands along the radial directions because potential and
interaction energy is released, but its width along x remains nearly constant. The
analysis of pictures taken before reﬂection gives access to the following parameters:
fraction of condensed atoms N0/N = 0.4, kinetic temperature of thermal cloud
T = 285 nK, initial Thomas-Fermi size along x of the condensed fraction Rx = 90 µm
and Thomas-Fermi velocity width along z: V⊥ = 5.96 mm/s. The condensate velocity
width along x is very small, thus non directly measurable. However, it can be inferred
from the knowledge of V⊥ and the oscillation frequencies in the magnetic trap, using
ωx
the solution for an expanding BEC [19]; we get Vx = π
ω⊥ V⊥ = 0.89 mm/s. The
2
observation of the center of mass motion during free fall permits us to calibrate the
pixel size knowing gravity’s acceleration and to infer the initial position and velocity

of the cloud. The magnetic ﬁeld switching process communicates a small acceleration
to the atoms along x, resulting in a horizontal velocity vx =

30.7 mm/s.

After reﬂection, the absorption images change dramatically (ﬁgure 2). The atoms
occupy the surface of a scattering sphere, hence an elastic, but strongly diﬀuse
scattering occurs. For t > treb, the cloud width along x increases from its initial
value due to an additional velocity spread σvx . The velocity Gaussian radius at 1/√e
deduced from the pictures is 39.4 mm.s−1. Taking into account the initial velocity
width before reﬂection, the spread due to diﬀuse reﬂection is σvx = 39 mm/s, that
is 6.6 vrec where vrec = ¯hkL/m = 5.89 mm/s is the recoil velocity for Rb. This
corresponds to an angular (rms) spread ∆θ

≈
The eﬀect of diﬀuse reﬂection along y is more subtle to analyze, as this axis is
aligned with the direction of observation. However, it is possible to extract information
about σvy from the picture. If for instance the scattering were totally isotropic, with
σvy = σvx , the atomic cloud should extend asymmetrically towards
z at a given
position x, as the projection of a spherical shell onto a plane extends towards the
inner part of the circle. If on the contrary the scattering would take place only along
x, the cloud width along z at a given position x should be very small, with a symmetric
shape.

3.2. Simulation

To get some insight into what happens along y, we performed a numerical simulation
105 individual classical
of the atomic reﬂection. The simulation calculates N = 3
atomic trajectories. The initial positions and velocities are chosen to mimic the
experimentally measured parameters: 40% of the atoms are “condensed” and are
described by the initial 3D Thomas-Fermi velocity and position distribution.
(We
neglected, however, the position spread along y and z because its contribution to the
cloud size after a few ms of time of ﬂight is very small.) The remaining 60% of the

of ﬂight than the experimental ones, ﬁgure 2. For this series, the velocity spread
was chosen to be σvy = σvx /2 = 19.5 mm/s. The position of the mirror surface
is marked by a grey line.

BEC diﬀuse reﬂection

atoms are distributed according to gaussian proﬁles for velocity and position, with
widths inferred from the knowledge of temperature and trap parameters. Position
and velocity of the cloud center are ﬁxed to the experimental values as well. The
mirror is modeled as a perfect mirror with instantaneous reﬂection. This assumption
is reasonable as the typical time spent in the evanescent wave is small, 1/κvi = 0.35 µs.
After reﬂection, the atomic velocity is modiﬁed to describe both specular reﬂection
(inversion of vertical velocity) and scattering. A random horizontal velocity is added
to the reﬂected velocity with a gaussian distribution. We take a 1/√e radius
σvx = 39 mm/s, as measured experimentally, and run simulations with varying σvy .
The z component of the velocity is adjusted in order to preserve kinetic energy (elastic
scattering). After calculation of all atomic trajectories, the atomic density proﬁle is
integrated along y and compared to the experimental pictures. We apply a Gaussian
blur ﬁlter with variance σ2 = σ2
spont to the simulated pictures to mimic the
ﬁnite resolution of the experimental imaging system (σres = 19 µm) and spontaneous
emission during reﬂection. The latter eﬀect can be estimated within a random walk
model in velocity space and gives, for an average of 0.13 spontaneous photons per
atom, σspont = √0.13(t

treb)vrec/√3.

3.3. Anisotropic scattering

The qualitative agreement between the experimental and simulated pictures is very
good as can be seen on ﬁgure 3. To be more quantitative for the possible values of
the velocity spread σvy , we analyze the central part of the cloud. For each time of
ﬂight, a region of size 0.8 mm
1.5 mm along x and z respectively, centered on the
maximum density of the cloud and identical for experimental and simulated pictures,
is isolated and an integration of the signal is performed along x. We are left with a
cut of the cloud along z, averaged over 0.8 mm along x. The experimental proﬁle is
compared to the simulated one, for diﬀerent choices of σvy after the bounce. Results
are shown on ﬁgure 4 for a time of ﬂight 59 ms.

×

The experimental data clearly exclude an isotropic diﬀuse reﬂection (ﬁgure 4,
bold line). They also are diﬀerent from the pure one dimensional scattering case (thin
line): what ﬁts best of all is a model intermediate between these two extremes, i.e.
the scattering is only half as strong along y compared to x. The atom mirror thus has
an angular reﬂection characteristic that is elongated in the direction parallel to the
(real part of the) wave vector of the evanescent wave.

3.4. Mirror corrugation

For a theoretical prediction of the anisotropic mirror reﬂection, we use the theory
of Ref.[16] where the diﬀuse scattering is attributed to the interference between the
evanescent wave and light diﬀusely scattered from the rough glass surface. Within
this theory, one can compute the width of the momentum distribution of the reﬂected
atoms provided the power spectrum of the surface roughness is known. This power
spectrum is a quantitative measure of the surface quality and has been measured with
4.5µm2 portion of the surface of
an atomic force microscope (AFM). A typical 4.5
the coated prism is shown in ﬁgure 5. One sees the top face of pillar-like structures
which are typical for epitaxially grown TiO2 on a substrate. The AFM data yield a
surface roughness σ = 3.34 nm (the rms spread of the measured surface proﬁle). A
Fourier transform of the AFM image gives access to the power spectrum PS(Q). (We

3.5. Diﬀuse reﬂection theory

We now show that the diﬀuse reﬂection we observe can be understood within the
theory of Ref.[16]. We note ﬁrst that the cloud is so dilute at the bounce that a single-
atom picture is suﬃcient to capture the physics. For a ﬁxed incident momentum
pinc = P
ezmvi near normal incidence, the reﬂected wave function can be written
in the form of a plane wave with a randomly modulated phase front:

−

ψreﬂ(r) = N exp i [pspec ·

r + δφ(R)] ,

where N is a normalization factor and pspec = P + ezmvi. (The dependence on the
angle of incidence is actually negligible for our parameters [16].) The phase δφ(R)
depends on the ‘impact position’ R on the mirror, i.e., the projection of r onto the
mirror plane. We perform an ensemble average over the realizations of the rough
surface and compute the atomic momentum distribution PA(P+¯hQ) from the (spatial)
Fourier transform of the ‘atomic coherence function’ [Sec. 6 of Ref.[16]]

This expression gives the additional broadening of the incident velocity distribution
due to the diﬀuse mirror reﬂection. We perform the integration of Eq.(6) numerically,
with the roughness power spectrum determined previously from the AFM images
(Eq.(1)). For simplicity, we calculate the response function Bat(Q) using scalar light
scattering from the topmost interface only, ignoring the actual layered structure. We
believe that this approximation is suﬃcient for a semi-quantitative estimate.

3.6. Comparison to the data

±

Within the theoretical model outlined above, the velocity spreading along the
propagation direction of the evanescent wave is found to be σvx = 6.76 vrec, which
is in very good agreement with the experimental value 6.6 vrec. We also compute
the anisotropy of the reﬂected atoms and ﬁnd a ratio σvx /σvy = 2.6,
in rather
good agreement with the value (2
0.5) extracted from the experimental data. As
discussed in Ref.[16], this anisotropy arises from the fact that diﬀuse reﬂection occurs
predominantly by Raman transitions where a photon is absorbed from the evanescent
wave (with wave vector kx = kLnTiO2 sin θi) and another photon is emitted into a
diﬀusely scattered mode that emerges at grazing incidence into the vacuum halfspace
(or the inverse process). If the scattered modes are distributed isotropically in the
mirror plane on a circle of radius rsckL, the ratio of the rms spreads would be
σvx /σvy = (2(nTiO2 sin(θi)/rsc)2 + 1)1/2. Taking rsc = 1, which corresponds to
scattered modes emerging at grazing incidence, we again ﬁnd an anisotropy ratio
of
2.5. This agreement is not very surprising since the rough surface has a
power spectrum much broader than the photon wavenumber kL (Fig.6). Within this
simple calculation, however, we can also get a quick estimate of the impact of the
dielectric coating. The choice rsc = nTiO2 sin(θi) corresponds to resonant scattering
into waveguide modes in the TiO2 layer and leads to a ratio σvx/σvy = √3 which
cannot be excluded experimentally. We thus ﬁnd consistent results between the AFM
measurements and the atomic reﬂection data.

≈

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have observed the diﬀuse reﬂection of an ultracold atomic beam
from an evanescent wave. The wave propagates on the rough surface of a dielectric
prism, and light scattering leads to an atom mirror showing a signiﬁcantly nonspecular
reﬂection. The angular broadening of the reﬂected atoms, as well as their anisotropic
angular distribution in the mirror plane, are in good agreement with a theory

BEC diﬀuse reﬂection

developed by Henkel et al. [16]. It is remarkable that this agreement does not imply
any free parameters since we independently measured the spectrum of the surface
roughness with an AFM. Our results demonstrate the advantages of using a BEC as
a brilliant atom source that combines high ﬂux and narrow collimation. A similar
sensitivity with ultracold, non-condensed atoms either requires severe ﬁltering [14] or
an interferometric scheme [20].

Abstract. A theory of the Post-Collision Interaction (PCI) is developed for the case
when an electron atom impact results in creation of two low-energy Wannier electrons
and an ion excited into an autoionizing state. The following autoionization decay
exposes the Wannier pair to the inﬂuence of PCI resulting in variation of the shape of
the line in the autoionization spectrum. An explicit dependence of the autoionization
proﬁle on the wave function of the Wannier pair is found. PCI provides an opportunity
to study this wave function for a wide area of distances.

Introduction

This paper develops a theoretical approach allowing one to consider PCI in the Wannier
regime. The interest in this problem has been initiated by recent experiment [1] followed
by theoretical work [2] in which the electron impact in the vicinity of the atomic inner
shell ionization threshold

e + A

→

eα + eβ + A+∗

was studied. In this reaction the inelastically scattered electron eα and the knocked out
electron eβ have low energy propagating in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the positive ion A+∗.
These low-energy electrons are known as the Wannier pair. The Coulomb interaction
of Wannier electrons between themselves as well as with the ﬁeld of the ion results in
the Wannier power law [3] for the cross-section

where ε is the energy excess over the ionization threshold and the exponent µ depends
non-trivially on the ion charge Z

A distinctive property of reaction (1.1) is the ﬁnite life-time of the inner-shell vacancy
in the ion A+∗. Its decay

eα + eβ + A+∗

eα + eβ + eγ + A2+

→

creates the fast Auger electron eγ and doubly-charged ion A2+. The fact that the pair
eα, eβ has low energy guarantees that at the moment of the decay it is situated in
some close vicinity of the ion. Therefore the pair should strongly interact with the
products of the Auger decay, i.e.
the doubly charged ion and Auger electron. An
interaction of this type is known in literature as the Post-Collision Interaction (PCI).
What distinguishes reaction (1.1),(1.4) is the fact that the Wannier pair takes part in
PCI. Previously PCI was extensively studied in the near threshold region for the case
when a single low-energy electron is localized in the vicinity of the atom at the moment
of the autoionization decay.

Thus reaction (1.1),(1.4) combines the two problems of the ﬁnal state interaction,
the Wannier problem and PCI. Previously they both had been extensively studied
experimentally as well as theoretically but in those situations when only one of them,
either the Wannier problem or PCI had manifested itself in the ﬁnal state.

The main purpose of this paper is development of the theory describing PCI in
reaction (1.1),(1.4) as well as in similar situations in electron or atomic collisions or in
photoionization. One of the interesting qualitative questions arising from the reaction

3

(1.1),(1.4) is a possible inﬂuence of PCI on the Wannier power law (1.2). In the ﬁeld of
1.127, while in the ﬁeld of the
the singly charged ion the Wannier exponent (1.3) is µ1 ≃
1.056. If the energy of the Auger electron eγ is high enough
doubly charged ion it is µ2 ≃
then it does not interact strongly with the pair eα,eβ and the decay could be considered
as a switch of the ion charge from the intermediate-state value Z = 1 to the ﬁnal-state
value Z = 2. The question is how this charge variation aﬀects the exponent. We will
demonstrate that for suﬃciently low above-threshold energy the exponent is equal to
µ2, while for higher energies it is µ1. This fact agrees with the following simple physical
picture. When above-threshold energy is very low then the Wannier pair is located so
close to the ion at the moment of the decay that its separation is negligible compared
with an important in the problem radius of the Coulomb zone. Therefore one can neglect
this separation, neglecting as well the very fact of existence of the intermediate-state
resonance. Thus in this case the pair is inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld of the ﬁnal-state ion
with the charge Z = 2. In contrast for high above-threshold energy the Wannier pair is
located well outside the radius of the Coulomb zone at the moment of the Auger decay
and therefore is not strongly inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld of the doubly-charged ion. The
main characteristics of the pair in this case are governed by the ion in the intermediate
state with Z = 1.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a short introduction to the
Wannier problem which was theoretically studied in a number of papers. The variety
of approaches developed and the comprehensive list of references can be found in [4] -
[8]. Section 3 presents a short review of essential ideas of PCI. The literature on the
theory of PCI can be found in [9]. These introductory notes permit presenting basic
ideas of the two problems from a particular point of view which provides the easiest way
for further development in Sections 4 and 5 where a way is found to describe PCI when
Wannier electrons are involved.

Generally speaking the problem considered looks very complicated being dependent
on the Coulomb interaction of three electrons and the ion. There are, however, important
simpliﬁcations. Firstly, we assume that the Wannier pair possesses low energy, while the
Auger electron is so fast that one can neglect its interaction with the pair. This allows
us to reformulate the problem in terms of the Wannier pair only. Still it is a dynamical
three-body problem. Another important simpliﬁcation comes from the cornerstone of
the Wannier problem [3].
In order to escape from the ionic ﬁeld Wannier electrons
should move along a particular classical trajectory. This motion can be considered as
a collective mode describing essential properties of the system. One can easily verify,
see Section 2, that this mode can be described in terms of an eﬀective single-particle
Coulomb problem. Of course there are important corrections arising from the three-
body nature of the problem and making it so speciﬁc and interesting. The point is
that knowing the reliable initial approximation one can ﬁnd these corrections in a clear

4

analytical form.

These arguments show that one should expect the problem considered to have a
clear solution. Finding and describing it in simple physical terms is the major goal of
this paper. The main result obtained is the formula which presents the autoionization
proﬁle Rpci distorted by PCI in the form

Rpci = KwRc

(1.5)

The factor Rc here arises from the most simple approximation for the Wannier problem
described by the above mentioned eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem. Due to
this reason we will call it the Coulomb factor. This factor depends on the overlapping
integral of the Coulomb wave functions. It is interesting that a similar factor describes
PCI in the traditional situation when there is only one low-energy electron. The only
distinction is that in the later case there is a true single-particle Coulomb problem, while
for the Wannier pair the Coulomb problem arises as an eﬀective approximation. Still
the similarity is so close that one can consider the Coulomb factor Rc as a well known
quantity which was well studied previously both experimentally and theoretically. In
contrast the factor Kw takes into account more subtle and interesting properties of the
process which are essential for PCI with the Wannier pair and have no analogy in PCI
with one low-energy electron. Due to this reason we will call it the Wannier factor. In
Section 5 an explicit analytical formula for this factor is derived. The Wannier factor
found depends on the normalization coeﬃcient of the Wannier electrons wave function.
It is interesting that the Wannier power law (1.2) arises from the properties of the
same coeﬃcient considered in the region of small separations of the pair from the atom.
In contrast, when PCI is studied this coeﬃcient manifests itself in a wide range of
distances. This property of the proﬁle (1.5) opens a possibility for experimental studies
of the normalization coeﬃcient of the Wannier pair wave function in a wide area of
distances.

The results obtained in Sections 4,5 are illustrated in Section 6 for the electron
impact near-threshold K-shell excitation of Ne. Section 7 presents a short description
of the major results.

2. Wannier problem

Consider two low-energy electrons in the ﬁeld of an ion with the charge Z. The Coulomb
repulsion between the electrons makes opposite directions the most favorable for them
[3]. To simplify the following consideration let us use this fact developing the following
model. Let us assume that the electrons are moving in opposite directions neglecting
ﬂuctuations in their angular distribution. Moreover, let us neglect as well the orbital
moment. Thus in this model angular variables are neglected which makes it essentially

one-dimensional. This model was applied earlier for description of the Wannier power
law [10].
It is important that the most interesting part of the Wannier problem, its
instability against a non-symmetrical distribution of energy between the two electrons,
is taken into account in full. Moreover, we will argue in Section 7 that our ﬁnal results
do not depend on model assumptions. One of the main advantages of the model is
simpliﬁcation of notation, which inevitably is to be suﬃciently complicated.

Our strategy in this Section is to ﬁrst consider the classical approximation and then
develop the quantum picture using the semiclassical approach which gives a correct
description of the process for low above-threshold energy. The semiclassical approach
to the Wannier problem was developed in detail in [4] to describe the near-threshold
behaviour of the reaction (1.1). In this case one is mainly interested in the behaviour of
the wave function of the Wannier pair for small separations. We will see that to describe
PCI it is necessary to know the wave function for any separation, not necessarily in the
vicinity of the atom. The convenient representation for this wave function valid for an
arbitrary separation is given below in equation (2.62) which is the main result of this
Section.

2.1. Classical trajectories

Consider classically the problem of two electrons eα,eβ in the framework of the above-
formulated one-dimensional model in which electrons are supposed to move in opposite
directions with zero orbital moments. Such a system is characterized by two radii

The function w(χ) has a minimum for the symmetrical conﬁguration χ = 0. It manifests
itself as a maximum at χ = 0 of the potential U(r, χ) considered as a function of χ. This
property of the potential is known as the Wannier ridge. The ridge makes the classical
system unstable. The instability results in the most important property of the Wannier
problem. In order to escape from the Coulomb ﬁeld of the ion the two electrons should
propagate in the vicinity of the symmetrical conﬁguration. Otherwise one of them would
be trapped by the ion ﬁeld, i.e. the pair fall oﬀ the ridge. That is why the motion in
the vicinity of the top of the ridge, where the pair is stable plays such an important role
and is considered in detail below.

In the vicinity of χ = 0 the function w(χ) can be expanded in the Taylor series

It is supposed in this paper that the later condition is valid. The given estimations show
that in this case the semiclassical approximation turns out to be correct permitting one
to write the wave function in the well known form

ψP (q) = N(q, P ) exp[iS(q, P )],

where S(q, P ) is the classical action. The wave function depends on a set of coordinates
q and quantum numbers P , the later ones play a role of parameters. It is convenient to
choose P as momenta conjugate to coordinates q. To be speciﬁc consider the convergent
wave function for the ﬁnal state ψ = ψ(−) which is the most interesting in the Wannier
problem. This wave function may be looked at as a transition amplitude from the state
in which coordinates q of the Wannier pair are in the vicinity of the atom to the ﬁnal
state in which momenta P describe the motion at an inﬁnite separation. In classical
terms the transition should be described by a trajectory with initial coordinates q and
ﬁnal momenta P . These two sets of parameters q and P ﬁx the trajectory. The classical
action depends on both these sets of variables S = S(q, P ) . It is well known that the
non-exponential factor N(q, P ) in the wave function depends on the derivatives of the
action [12]

A convenience of this choice becomes apparent soon. The corresponding momenta are

χ.
The minus sign is dropped to simplify notation.) Here p is a momentum conjugate to r

−

To avoid confusion the bar symbol is used to mark the variables belonging to the ﬁnal
point of the trajectory for inﬁnite separations. In this notation the energy of the pair is
written as ǫ = ¯p2/2, and the action looks like S = S(r, η; ¯p, ¯χ). Calculating the action
we should consider the region in the vicinity of the Wannier ridge where both ¯χ and η
are small. Therefore we can expand the action in powers of these variables

S(r, η; ¯p, ¯χ) = ˆS0(r, ¯p) + ˆΣ(r, η; ¯p, ¯χ),

describes a one-dimensional motion along the ridge-top trajectory governed by the
eﬀective Coulomb charge w. We will recognize later, see (2.55), that a slightly diﬀerent
choice of the eﬀective charge proves to be more convenient. The quantities which will be
recognized be aﬀected by this redeﬁnition are marked by the hat symbol. The quantity
ˆΣ(r, η; ¯p, ¯χ) depends on the derivatives of S. The ﬁrst derivatives for the ridge-top
trajectory are obviously zero. Therefore, the expansion starts from the second powers
of ¯χ, η. It is shown below, see discussion after (2.62), that it is suﬃcient to restrict our
consideration to these lowest order terms writing

Evaluating the last identity in (2.48) the Wronskian (2.33) was used. All three

In order to deal with this problem let us remember that the Coulomb action ˆS0 (2.41)
reveals the logarithmic divergence as well, ˆS0 ∼
. This
later divergence proves harmless. Really, it takes place for an eﬀective one-dimensional
Coulomb problem described by the only coordinate r. For this simple situation
the Coulomb logarithmic divergence is of course well studied and cured by textbook
methods, see [11]. Having this in mind let us “renormalize” ˆS0 and ˆΣ, ˆS0 →
Σ

S0, ˆΣ

→

¯r

S(r, η; ¯p, ¯χ) = S0(r, ¯p) + Σ(r, η; ¯p, ¯χ)

in a way that makes the divergence (2.53) apparently harmless as well. The action
S0(r, ¯p) in (2.54) is deﬁned as

S0(r, ¯p) =

It describes the one-dimensional motion in the ﬁeld of the Coulomb charge w( ¯χ) (2.5)
which explicitly depends on ¯χ2, see (2.6). This property distinguishes it from the “non-
renormalized” quantity ˆS0 (2.41) which does not depend on ¯χ. The renormalized Σ

This single-particle wave function gives an eﬀective description of propagation of the
Wannier pair near the top of the Wannier ridge. The propagation is characterized
by the momentum p and the eﬀective Coulomb charge w(χ).
It is often more
convenient to work directly with the Coulomb wave function rather than with its
semiclassical representation (2.63), though one can keep open a possibility to return
to the semiclassical description when necessary.

The quantity Σ(r, η; p, χ) in (2.62) is deﬁned by expansion (2.57), the coeﬃcients
A(x), B(x), C(x) of which are given in (2.58),(2.51) and (2.52). From (2.62) we conclude
that typical values for both χ and η are restricted by the available above-threshold
energy. For χ we ﬁnd χ2

typical classical value of the momentum η which according to (2.46) is estimated as
η0 = const/p. For low energy, see (2.35), both χ and η are small, χ2

The normalization coeﬃcient 1/√p is convenient for the following calculations, see (5.2)

resulting in the eﬀective Coulomb charge w(χ)
approaches the value
which in this representation does not depend on arguments of the wave function and
may be considered as a given constant. We have used this fact above to satisfy boundary
conditions for large separation. In other representations, for example in representation
in which χ is an argument of a wave function and η is a parameter it is more laborious
to satisfy these boundary conditions.

The discussion above shows that the main features of the Wannier problem are
described by the eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem with the eﬀective Coulomb
charge w(χ). An essential property of the single-particle problem is a phase shift. In
order to ﬁnd it let us present it in the following form

δ(χ) = δc(χ) + ∆δ(χ).

An additional phase shift ∆δ(χ) is produced by the term Σ(r, η; p, χ) in the exponent

Evaluating the last equality (2.65),(2.68) were used. The minus sign in front of the
square brackets in (2.74) agrees with deﬁnition (2.64) of the function φ(−)
(r; w(χ)).
From the asymptotic condition (2.71) we conclude that the found phases (2.73),(2.74)
are the only ones which contribute to the phase shift (2.72).

p

The found representation for the wave function of the Wannier problem (2.62) has a
clear physical meaning. The Wannier problem takes place in the vicinity of the Wannier
ridge. This allows to present essential properties of the two-electron problem by the
eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem. The Coulomb wave function φ(−)
(r; w(χ)) of
this eﬀective Coulomb problem gives the simplest approximation. The nontrivial three-
body nature of the Wannier problem is taken care of by the quantities Σ(r, η; p, χ), B(x)
which accounts for small ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of the ridge-top trajectory. These
ﬂuctuations result in two interesting properties. Firstly, the state of the Wannier pair
on the top of the ridge is unstable in respect to sliding down into conﬁguration when one
electron is close to the atom while another one is far apart. This reduces the probability
for the pair to survive on the top of the ridge. This eﬀect is taken into account by the
normalization coeﬃcient B(x)
1. Secondly, there appears an additional important
contribution to the phase shift ∆δ(χ) in the eﬀective single-particle problem.

If the wave function (2.62) is used in the traditional Wannier problem to calculate
the cross-section of a process with two Wannier electrons in the ﬁnal state then the
normalization coeﬃcient B(x) should be estimated with the help of (2.66) in the vicinity

Summation in (3.1) takes into account all possible states for Wannier electrons eα, eβ in
the intermediate state. The potential Vcol describes the part of the Hamiltonian which is
responsible for the collision, and VA is the potential which causes the Auger decay. The
energy denominator depends on the above-threshold energy as well as on the energies
εαj, εβj of the Wannier electrons in the intermediate state and the total width Γ of the
autoionizing atomic state. We are interested in the low near-threshold energies for the
Wannier pair (2.35). In contrast the autoionized electron is suﬃciently fast and we can

inequality (3.2) guarantees that the interaction between the Wannier pair and the

Equation (3.5) states that the inﬂuence of PCI on the Wannier pair can be described
with the help of the overlapping integral. This result is very close in spirit to the shake-
down model [13, 14] which originally was developed for the case when one near-threshold
electron is exposed to the variation of the charge of the atomic particle caused by the
autoionization. In the case under consideration there are two near-threshold electrons,
but the idea that overlapping of the wave functions gives the correct description of PCI
remains the same.

which is a function of the coordinates of the pair. For large separations from the ion
this function becomes proportional to the amplitude of inelastic scattering and inversely
proportional to separation. It is important that the eﬀects of PCI take place far outside
the atomic particle [9], where the source is small

in the region far outside the atom and then normalize this function to make it

inﬂuence of the source.

The given consideration shows that PCI for the Wannier pair in the vicinity of the
threshold is described by the overlapping integral of the wave functions describing the
pair in the intermediate and ﬁnal states (3.5). Notice that this possibility follows from
conditions (3.2),(3.3). In this sense it is rather a theoretical result then a model.

4. PCI for the Wannier pair

Let us calculate the overlapping integral (3.5) using the wave functions for the Wannier
problem evaluated in Section 2. The model suggested in Section 2 describes the state
of the Wannier pair by its energy and the quantum number χ. The amplitude of the
inelastic collision depends on these quantum numbers

The square brackets with the index 2 are to remind that all the quantities in the square
brackets should be calculated for the ﬁnal state in which the Coulomb charge of the
ion is Z = Z2 = 2 and the momentum of the pair is p = √2E. Notation introduced in
(4.3),(4.8) will be used below as well. All quantities labeled by an index 1 are considered
for the intermediate state of the Wannier pair. In this state the ion charge is Z = Z1 = 1,
the energy of the pair is ε+iΓ/2, the corresponding momentum is k (4.6). The quantities
labeled by an index 2 describe the ﬁnal state with Z = Z2 = 2, the ﬁnal-state energy of
the pair E and the corresponding momentum p = √2E.

The explicit form of the wave functions (4.5,(4.8) permits to present the matrix

The above given consideration shows that this representation has a simple physical
meaning. The fast autoionization decay results in an abrupt transition of the Wannier
pair from the intermediate state to the ﬁnal state. This transition is described by the
overlapping integral of the wave functions for the intermediate and ﬁnal states

The integration over dχ′ in (4.10) reﬂects the fact that the intermediate state includes
the coherent superposition of the states of the pair with diﬀerent χ′ excited due to
inelastic collision. The factor exp[iδ1(χ′)] describes fast variation of the amplitude of
the excitation with χ′.

Integration in (4.10) over dη is Gaussian, therefore it can be fulﬁlled analytically,
allowing the presentation of the amplitude S21 as a two-dimensional integral which can
be easily handled numerically.

presents the inﬂuence of PCI in the explicit form described by the amplitude S21 in
(4.10). This factor has a resonant nature sharply depending both on the above-threshold
energy ε and the ﬁnal-state energy of the pair E.

Equations (4.10),(4.12),(4.13) explicitly describe the inﬂuence of PCI on the cross-
section. The physical consequences of these formulae are discussed in the next Section

5. Manifestations of PCI

5.1. Lorentz line

Consider ﬁrst the trivial situation when one neglects the eﬀects of PCI supposing that
the Coulomb charge of the ion in the intermediate and ﬁnal state remains the same
Z1 = Z2. Then the wave functions marked by symbols 1 and 2 in (4.2),(4.8) diﬀer only by
the momenta k and p. Notice that the coeﬃcients A(x), B(x), C(x) in the expansion of
Σ(r, η; p, χ) (2.57) are smooth functions. Therefore using inequality (3.3) we can assume
that they do not vary much when the energy parameter ǫ in (2.16) takes either the value
ǫ = E, or ǫ = ε, i.e. A(x)
|ǫ=ε, B(x)
|ǫ=ε.
The last equality greatly simpliﬁes integration over dη in (4.10)

with the Coulomb wave functions in the ﬁeld of the same eﬀective Coulomb charge

as it should be when PCI is neglected. Notice that this result justiﬁes the normalization
of the wave functions in (2.64).

5.2. Eikonal region

Let us examine now the inﬂuence of PCI on the Wannier pair. The integration over
rl (4.7). It is essential how the localization
dr in (4.10) is localized in the region r
radius rl is related to the Coulomb radius rc (2.34). Let us examine the situation when

In this case the main
contribution to the integral (4.10) comes from the region where asymptotic relations
(2.68),(2.69),(2.70) are fulﬁlled. They imply that B1(r, k)

Both wave functions here describe the eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem. This
problem in the intermediate state is governed by the eﬀective charge w1(χ) deﬁned by
(2.6),(2.7),(2.8) with the ion charge Z = Z1 = 1. In the ﬁnal state the eﬀective charge
w2(χ) depends on the ﬁnal-state ion charge Z = Z2 = 2.

The factor Rc(E, ε) deﬁned in (5.6) depends on the overlapping integral between the
wave functions describing the eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem. It is remarkable
that this integral proves to be similar to the quantity which was well-known previously
in the traditional PCI problem when a single low-energy electron is inﬂuenced by the
products of the autoionization decay.
In this case the shake-down model [13, 14, 9]
gives correct description of PCI. The shake-down model is based on an overlapping
integral with single-electron wave functions, whose structure is very close to the integral
in (5.6),(5.7).

We come to a very interesting conclusion. Our knowledge of PCI properties of
the traditional situation when there is only one near-threshold electron enables us to
predict manifestations of PCI when the Wannier pair is involved. Conveniently we do
not even need to fulﬁll explicitly calculation of the overlapping integral (5.5) which
appears in (5.7).
Inequality (5.3) guarantees that after the decay the Wannier pair
is located so far away from the atom that neither the Coulomb charge of the ion nor
repulsion between the electrons can signiﬁcantly change the classical trajectory. Thus
the pair moves almost without acceleration, which greatly simplify behaviour of the
wave functions describing this motion. A similar case was well studied in the single-
electron problem. It was shown [9] that the eikonal approximation and the shake-down
model give the same results when conditions of applicability for the eikonal theory are
fulﬁlled. Borrowing this result from the true single-electron problem and applying it to
our eﬀective single-particle problem we conclude that the eikonal theory proves to be
correct for the Wannier pair if condition (5.3) is fulﬁlled. Notice that condition (5.3)
can be rewritten in the standard in the eikonal approximation form ε3/2
Γ. Of course
one could anticipate from the very beginning that when this usual condition is valid,
then the eikonal theory should give the correct description of PCI for the Wannier pair.
However, the peculiarity of the Wannier problem certainly appeals for a steady basis for
such a statement. That is why it is important that we have been able to demonstrate
validity of the eikonal theory by direct calculations.

≫

Recognizing that the eikonal approximation is valid, we conclude that PCI for the

Wannier pair should have the following manifestations.
1. The line in the autoionization spectrum is shifted by PCI. The shift is equal to [15, 9]

2. The line changes the shape, becoming broader,
lower, and acquiring the “left
shoulder” which makes it asymmetrical. All these variations are the more signiﬁcant

24

the larger is the basic parameter ξ. These properties of the line are described by the

3. In spite of strong variations in the shape and position the intensity of the line remains
constant, it is not inﬂuenced by PCI,

Rpci(E, ε)dE = 1.

Z

This property is essential for the Wannier problem where intensity is one of the main
characteristics of the process. Taking into account that the cross-section of the reaction
(1.1) satisﬁes the power law (1.2) with the index µ = µ1 = 1.127 we ﬁnd from
(1.2)(4.12),(5.11) that this law remains valid for the total intensity of the line for reaction

considered as a function of the above-threshold energy.

Up to this point our consideration was restricted by two particular assumptions.
Firstly, we considered the case of large velocities of the autoionized electron (3.2) which
allows one to assume that it does not play a role in PCI. Secondly, we discussed the
opposite directions for the Wannier electrons neglecting ﬂuctuations in their angular
distribution. Once we have established that the eikonal theory is correct we can remove
both these simpliﬁcations and include into our scheme the case of suﬃciently low-energy
autoionization and arbitrary directions for the Wannier electrons. As usual in the eikonal
approximation it is suﬃcient to redeﬁne the parameter ξ which has the following more
general form

line which depends on the absolute values as well as directions of the velocities of all
three electrons.

This inequality holds for suﬃciently low energies E, ε. This inequality means that the
decay takes place when the pair is so close to the ion that the Coulomb potential has a
strong inﬂuence on trajectories of the Wannier pair.

Let us examine the behaviour of the integrand in the amplitude S21 in (4.10) as
a function of χ′. Remember that in the region r
rc the asymptotic relations
(2.65),(2.66), and (2.67) for the coeﬃcients governing the action Σ are valid. Notice
ﬁrst of all that the quadratic in χ′ terms in the exponent arising from the phase
shift ∆δ1(χ′) and from the term [Σ(r, η; p, χ′)]1 cancel each other due to (2.65),(2.74).
Another simpliﬁcation comes from the fact that for small distances the Coulomb function
smoothly depends on χ′ exhibiting behaviour
χ′2, see discussion after (4.4). Therefore
one can suppose that

The energies E, ε are low (5.14), therefore the radius r = rsp is large. This fact
justiﬁes both the applicability of the semiclassical estimation for the phases in (5.19)
and the validity of the saddle-point approximation. These arguments demonstrate that
calculating the matrix element (5.17) we can suppose that the main contribution to the
integral comes from the vicinity of the saddle point (5.21). This allows one to evaluate
smooth functions [B(x)]1, [B(x)]2 at this point and take them out of integration. As a
result the resonant factor given by (5.18) can be simpliﬁed to the following ﬁnal form
which was ﬁrst announced in (1.5) as the major result of this paper

Rpci(E, ε) = Kw(E, ε)Rc(E, ε),

(5.22)

We met the factor (5.23) before when discussed the eikonal approximation, see (5.7).
It was argued there that the factor Rc(E, ε) describes those properties of PCI which were

which appears in (5.22) is a new quantity speciﬁc for PCI with Wannier electrons, having
no analogue in PCI with one low-energy electron. Due to this reason it is called the
Wannier factor. Remember that the function B(x) deﬁned by (2.51),(2.26),(2.16) gives
normalization for the wave function of Wannier electrons (2.62). The found Wannier
factor depends on a ratio of these normalization functions for the intermediate and ﬁnal
states. The coordinates of normalization functions, in accordance with (2.16) are deﬁned

behaviour of the normalization coeﬃcient B(x) for small separations when Er
1, see
(2.66). Thus traditional studies of the Wannier problem can be considered as a probing
of the normalization coeﬃcient B(x) in the particular asymptotic region well inside
the Coulomb zone. PCI opens an interesting opportunity to investigate this coeﬃcient
in a much wider area, not necessarily restricted by the Coulomb zone. According to
(5.25),(5.26) variation of the above-threshold energy ε and the ﬁnal-state energy E
leads to variation of x1,sp, x2,sp in a broad area resulting in signiﬁcant variation of
normalization coeﬃcients [B(x)]1 and [B(x)]2.

The result obtained (5.22) permits one to address the question of the threshold
behaviour of the cross-section which is of particular interest for the Wannier problem.

We see that PCI has a dramatic eﬀect on the threshold behaviour of the cross-section.
Firstly, the PCI results in the variation of the exponent. The exponent in (5.28)
corresponds to the ﬁnal-state charge of the ion Z = Z2 = 2 which gives µ2 = 1.056. If the
Auger decay is impossible, then the cross-section of the reaction (1.1) is described by the
usual Wannier power law (1.2) which corresponds to the charge of the ion Z = Z1 = 1
resulting in µ1 = 1.127. Secondly, the cross-section does not depend on the above-
threshold energy ε. These results agree qualitatively with the simple physical picture.
If above threshold energy is low then the decay takes place when the pair is so close
to the ion that its separation can be neglected compared with the large radius of the
Coulomb zone. This means that the propagation of the pair in the intermediate state

28

≤

is insigniﬁcant, which makes insigniﬁcant as well the very existence of this intermediate
state. That is why the ﬁnal answer for the Wannier exponent should not depend on
parameters governing the intermediate state. The fact that (5.22) reproduces this result
can be considered as a qualitative veriﬁcation of this formula.

Generally speaking, one could contemplate a possibility to measure the power-type
behaviour (5.28). To this end one should ﬁx the above-threshold energy and measure the
“left shoulder” of the resonance proﬁle in the near-threshold region versus the energy
of the Wannier pair. However this project meets a diﬃculty. It can be veriﬁed that
in order to distinguish the exponent µ2 from µ1 in the power-type behaviour of the
cross-section (5.28) the left-hand side in inequality (5.14) should be really small, say,
less than

10−2 putting a severe restriction on E, ε.

The most important result of this Subsection is (5.22) which describes the inﬂuence
of PCI on the resonance proﬁle. This equation was evaluated assuming that energies E, ε
are low enough to satisfy condition (5.14). Notice, however, that the equation remains
correct for much higher energies satisfying the condition of applicability of the eikonal
approximation (5.3) which is opposite to the low-energy limit. To see this consider
Γ2/3. For these energies (5.21)

1. Equations (5.25),(5.26) show

that the Wannier factor is trivial Kw(E, ε)

yields Rpci(E, ε)
Rc(E, ε) which according to (5.7) is the correct result. The fact that
(5.22) proves to be correct in both the eikonal region rl ≪

they move in opposite directions possessing equal energies. Notice that experimentally

The full curve in ﬁgure 1 presents the results of calculations based on the most
advanced equation (5.22) which, as was argued above is valid for both near-threshold
2 is calculated by direct
and high energy regions. The factor Rc(E, ε) = Γ/(2π)
numerical integration of the overlapping integral with the Coulomb wave functions
describing the eﬀective single-particle problem. Remember that this problem gives the
simplest description of the Wannier pair. Normalization of the Coulomb wave functions
is given in (2.64). For numerical calculations it is more convenient to work with the real
Coulomb wave function φ2(r) taking a linear combination of convergent and divergent
waves, rather then only the convergent wave. This is possible because the divergent
wave in φ2(r) does not contribute to the resonance, see discussion before (4.8). The
wave function φ1(r) has to be taken as a divergent wave localized in the vicinity of the
atom [9]. The Wannier factor Kw(E, ε) is found from (2.51),(2.26).

Full dotes in ﬁgure 1 present calculation based on (5.18). The perfect agreement
between the full lines and the full circles shows the high accuracy of the approximation
which was used in order to present the resonant factor in the ﬁnal form (5.22) as a
product of two diﬀerent factors.

Dotted lines in ﬁgure 1 present the simple eikonal approximation (5.10) which should
be correct only for high energies. Results presented show that below ε = 5 eV the eikonal
approximation fails, while for high above-threshold energies ε
10 eV it produces quite
reliable results. Notice that experimental results of [1] belong to the region ε
10 eV
where we have just veriﬁed the eikonal approximation to be valid.

The dotted line in ﬁgure 1(a) shows the Coulomb factor Rc(E, ε) which is known to
produce good results for PCI with a single low-energy electron. Figure (1a) shows that
for the considered situation with two low-energy electrons it proves to be incorrect for low
energies. This demonstrates that the Wannier factor Kw(E, ε) plays a very important
role. The Wannier factor exhibits quite an interesting variation as demonstrated in ﬁgure
2 where it is presented versus the energy of the pair E for the ﬁxed above-threshold
energy ε = 2 eV. In order to reveal the asymptotic low-energy behaviour

predicted by (5.28) the Wannier factor is shown as Kw(E, ε)/E.

The PCI shift found from calculations of the PCI proﬁles is shown in ﬁgure 3 for the
symmetrical conﬁguration of Wannier electrons. The full curve gives the results obtained
from (5.22). The dotted line shows the prediction of the eikonal approximation. The full
dottes in ﬁgure 3 present the results extracted from the proﬁles calculated in [2]. These
results eﬀectively include diﬀerent possible conﬁgurations of Wannier electrons in the
ﬁnal state. One can expect that the symmetrical conﬁguration of the Wannier electrons
gives large contribution to the total probability. Therefore the results calculated for
the symmetrical conﬁguration should reasonably agree with calculations in which all

30

continuum states of Wannier electrons are included. Notice that the theory developed
above and the approach of [2] are very diﬀerent in technique used. Nevertheless there
is a clear resemblance in several important basic features. Firstly, in both works PCI is
described with the help of overlapping integrals between wave functions describing the
Wannier pair. Secondly, both works rely upon the semiclassical approximation. Having
in mind these basic similarities one could expect that the two approaches should give
similar results. This hope proves be correct for high energies, see ﬁgure 1(d) for 10
eV above the threshold. There is, however, some discrepancy below 10 eV. It can be
veriﬁed comparing ﬁgure 1 with the results presented in ﬁgure of [2] that distinctions
exist in proﬁle shapes as well.

7. Discussion of the main results

This paper develops the following ideas and results.

1.It is emphasized that the propagation of two Wannier electrons can be described
by an eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem with corrections which take into account
more subtle three-body properties. Correspondingly the wave function of the Wannier
pair (2.62) is presented as the product of the Coulomb wave function describing the
eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem, the additional phase factor exp(iΣ), and the
normalization coeﬃcient B (2.51) which plays a very important role in our consideration.
2.The complex problem (1.1),(1.4) with three electrons in the ﬁnal state is reduced
to a more simple problem in which only two Wannier electrons play a role. The key
point is an assumption that the autoionization energy is so high that the autoionized
electron cannot interact strongly with the other two electrons. The dynamical properties
responsible for PCI are shown to be described by the overlapping integral (4.10) between
the wave functions of Wannier electrons in the ﬁnal and intermediate states.

3. The resonant factor is found in a very simple form (5.22) which depends on
two factors. One of them Rc describes the overlapping integral between the Coulomb
wave functions for the eﬀective single-particle problem. A similar integral is known to
describe PCI when there is only one near-threshold electron. More speciﬁc properties
of the considered problem are described by the Wannier factor Kw. The factorization
of the resonant factor into a product of Kw and Rc has a clear physical reason. There
are two scales in the problem. The eﬀective single-particle Coulomb problem describes
1/p. In contrast,
strong variations of the wave function with a typical radius rsingle ∼
the quantities Σ, B describing the speciﬁc properties of the three-body problem vary
1/p2. For low
with a typical distance equal to the radius of the Coulomb zone r3−body ∼
r3−body. It is well known that when there are
energies these radii are diﬀerent rsingle ≪
two diﬀerent scales in a problem then one has to expect an amplitude and a probability
to be presented as products of quantities describing events which happen in diﬀerent

31

scales, as it happens in our case.

Equation (5.22) was veriﬁed for low energies, i.e. in the Coulomb region, and for
high energies in the eikonal zone. For intermediate region one can hope that it should
give reasonable results. (However, validity of the later assumption should be clariﬁed
by numerical integration of the matrix element (4.10).)

The Wannier factor Kw is shown to depend on the normalization coeﬃcient B of the
wave function of the Wannier pair, see (5.24). The distance at which this coeﬃcient is
to be taken depends on the above-threshold energy as well as on the energy of the pair
in the ﬁnal state, see (5.21). It is remarkable that the same coeﬃcient considered for
small separations (2.66) governs the Wannier power law (1.2), and therefore it has been
under thorough experimental investigation for a long period of time. Equation (5.22)
shows that there is a new possibility to experimentally investigate the coeﬃcient B in
a wide range of distances.

4.It is demonstrated that for low energies of the pair E

0 the Wannier power
law has the form (5.27) with the exponent governed by the ion charge in the ﬁnal state.
In contrast for higher energies in the eikonal region the power law has a form of (5.12)
depending on the above-threshold energy ε with the exponent governed by the ion charge
in the intermediate state.

5.Our consideration was restricted by the one-dimensional model formulated in
Section 2. However, one can hope that the approach developed is more general than
the model itself. There are clear physical reasons for this. Firstly, PCI as well as
the Wannier problem manifest themselves for large separations where the Coulomb
potential play an important role, while the more rapidly decreasing orbital barrier does
not. Therefore neglect of this later potential seems reasonable. Secondly, the arguments
considered above show that the factorization of the resonant factor into the product of
the Coulomb factor and the Wannier factor is a general property caused by existence
of the two diﬀerent scales in the problem. Therefore it should remain valid when the
angular variables are included as well.

between the full line and full-circled one shows the high accuracy of the approximation
which permits to present the resonant factor in the ﬁnal form (5.22). Figure (d) shows
that the eikonal approximation is valid above 10 eV. The strong deviation of the dashed
line from the full one in ﬁgure (a) indicates an important role played by the Wannier
factor Kw(E, ε) for low energies.

Abstract

We have investigated the correction to the hyperﬁne structure of heavy mul-

ticharged ions, which is connected with the nuclear-polarization eﬀect caused

by the unpaired bound electron. Numerical calculations are performed for

hydrogenlike ions taking into account the dominant collective nuclear exci-

tations. The correction deﬁnes the ultimate limit of precision in accurate

theoretical predictions of the hyperﬁne-structure splittings.

During the last decade a signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in investigations of the

hypeﬁne structure (hfs) in heavy multicharged ions. To date, accurate measurements of hfs

splittings were performed for a number of elements by using optical spectroscopy at the

experimental storage ring at GSI in Darmstadt and at the Super-EBIT at the Lawrence

Livermore National Laboratory [1,2,3,4,5,6]. One of the major purposes of these investiga-

tions consists in testing nontrivial eﬀects of bound-state QED in intense nuclear ﬁelds with

an accuracy on the level of a few percent. Experiments on the hfs splitting allow one also to

probe internal nuclear structure, in particular, the magnetic moment distribution within the

nucleus (the so-called Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect). Though a rough estimate of the latter eﬀect

can be obtained in the framework of the single-nucleon model, its accurate calculation with

the use of a microscopic nuclear theory still has to be performed.

Two attempts to calculate the extended magnetization distribution taking into account

nuclear many-body corrections should be mentioned here. The ﬁrst approach is based on

the dynamic correlation model [7], which allows to include the excited-core conﬁgurations

in the nuclear wave function. Numerical calculations performed in the framework of this

model provide accurate values for the nuclear magnetic moments. However, no satisfactory

agreement with experimental results for the hfs splittings has been achieved [8]. The sec-

ond approach, which also takes into account the nuclear core polarization by the unpaired

nucleon, is based on the theory of ﬁnite Fermi systems [9]. In this case, the correction due

to the nuclear magnetization distribution calculated for hydrogenlike bismuth turned out to

be too small compared with the corresponding value deduced from the experiment.

At present it appears to be unlikely to obtain an accurate theoretical value for the Bohr-

Weisskopf correction. However, one can eliminate it to a large extend in combined measure-

ments of the hfs splittings in H- and Li-like ions [10]. For the ground state of 209Bi80+, two

independent calculations have lead to similar predictions, 797.1(2) meV [11] and 797.15(13)

meV [12], respectively. While both theoretical results agree with the experimental value

of 820(26) meV [4], further eﬀorts to measure the predicted splitting with higher precision

have not been successfull.

In the present paper we evaluate a correction, which has not been previously considered

in calculations of the hyperﬁne structure. The correction is connected with the nuclear-

polarization eﬀect caused by the unpaired bound electron. While the corresponding contri-

bution is relatively small in the case of hydrogenlike ions, it turns out to be non-negligible

for accurate theoretical predictions of the hfs splittings in Li-like heavy ions. Since the

uncertainty of our calculation is comparable with the magnitude of the nuclear-polarization

eﬀect itself, the latter cannot be completely eliminated by extracting the Bohr-Weisskopf

contribution in accordance with Shabaev’s idea [10]. The eﬀect under consideration sets a

natural limit up to which one can test bound-state QED, even if a speciﬁc diﬀerence of the

hfs splittings of H- and Li-like ions is introduced [13].

In the following, we shall consider a hydrogenlike ion with a nonzero-spin nucleus, so

that the total angular momentum of an atom F is deﬁned by the coupling of the nuclear

spin I with the total angular momentum of an electron j. The hfs energy shift due to the

magnetic-dipole interaction is given by

∆Eµ(F ) =

[F (F + 1)

I(I + 1)

j(j + 1)] Anκ.

(1)

Here Anκ is the hfs constant, which depends on the electron state characterized by the

standard set of quantum numbers. For electron states with j = 1/2, the hfs splitting

between the levels with F = I + 1/2 and F = I

1/2 is just ∆Enκ = (I + 1/2)Anκ. Since

−

the nuclear size is rather small with respect to the radius of the electron orbit, the hyperﬁne

structure can be fairly understood in the framework of the external-ﬁeld approximation.

This allows to treat the magnetic ﬁeld of a nucleus as a perturbing potential in calculations

of the hfs splitting.

Employing the Dirac equation for the electron in the external ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely heavy

pointlike nucleus, one obtains (¯h = c = 1) [14,15,16]

masses, respectively. Because of various nuclear and QED eﬀects, the experimental value for

the hfs constant deviates from its Dirac prediction (2). To describe the extended nucleus,

one usually employs the following parametrization

ǫnκ),

−

(3)

where the corrections δnκ and ǫnκ account for the nuclear charge and magnetic moment

distributions within the nucleus, respectively [17,18,19,20]. In addition to the approxima-

tion (3), the radiative corrections should be taken into account. All leading QED eﬀects

for the hyperﬁne structure have been independently calculated by diﬀerent groups and the

numerical results are consistent [21]. For Li-like ions, one can develop a perturbation theory

with respect to the parameter 1/Z, which accounts for corrections arising from the electron-

electron interaction [11,22]. The recoil correction, which is due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass, is

negligibly small for heavy ions.

Here we consider a correction ∆Anκ to the hfs constant (3) due to the nuclear-polarization

eﬀect, which is caused by the bound electron. More precisely, a core-polarization part of

the eﬀect is considered only, which is due to collective nuclear excitations. The correspond-

ing single-nucleon contributions should be generally considered beyond the external-ﬁeld

approximation. However, they are assumed to be completely negligible. To describe nu-

clear polarization, we adopt a relativistic ﬁeld theoretical approach, which incorporates the

many-body theory for virtual nuclear excitations within bound-state QED for atomic elec-

trons [23]. This approach has been successfully applied in calculations of nuclear-polarization

eﬀects to the Lamb shift [23,24,25] and to the bound-electron g factor [26]. To some extent,

the present formulae are quite similar to those derived in Ref. [26]. The correction under

consideration may be represented by the sum of contributions, which are referred to as the

irreducible, the reducible, and the vertex parts.

The irreducible contribution to the hfs constant can be written in terms of a multipole

decomposition as follows:

respectively. Here ∆Apol

nκ accounts for the terms with n1 = n2 and κ1 = κ2 in the sums over

intermediate states. The prime in the sum in Eq. (12) indicates that εn1κ1 6
κ1 = κ2, i.e., the pole contribution is supposed to be omitted. In Eqs. (11) and (12), the

= εn2κ2 when

value l + l1 + L has to be even. A second condition in Eq. (12) is that the sum l1 + l2

should be even as well. The total nuclear core-polarization contribution to the hfs constant

is determined by the sum of all contributions given by Eqs. (4), (10), (11), and (12).

In Table I, we present numerical results for some hydrogenlike ions, which are of par-

ticular experimental interest. The calculations were performed taking into account a ﬁnite

set of dominant collective nuclear excitations. To estimate the nuclear parameters, ωL and

B(EL), in the case of nearly spherical nucleus of 209

83Bi, we employed experimental data

corresponding to the low-lying vibrational levels in neighbouring even-even isotope of 208

82Pb,

which were deduced from nuclear Coulomb excitation. In the case of giant resonances, we

utilized phenomenological energy-weighted sum rules [30], which are assumed to be concen-

trated in single resonant states. In the present calculations, contributions due to monopole,

dipole, quadrupole, and octupole giant resonances have been taken into account. The inﬁnite

6

summations over the entire Dirac spectrum were performed by the ﬁnite basis set method.

Basis functions are generated via B splines including nuclear-size eﬀects [31].

Concluding, we have evaluated a correction to the hyperﬁne structure in heavy mul-

ticharged ions, which is connected with the nuclear core-polarization eﬀect caused by the

unpaired bound electron. The correction is exhausted over distances of the order of the

nuclear size and it is enhanced due to a singular behavior of the hyperﬁne-interaction op-

erator. The uncertainty of our calculation can be as large as the nuclear-polarization eﬀect

itself. It yet determines the natural limitation for testing higher-order QED corrections in

future experiments aiming for accurate hfs measurements. In the case that the experimen-

tal value for the ground-state hfs splitting is used to eliminate the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect

[10], the latter cannot be separated from the eﬀect we have considered. Accordingly, the

utmost precision for theoretical hfs predictions in lithiumlike heavy ions is determined by

the nuclear-polarization correction to the ground state in hydrogenlike ions. In particular,

for the ground state in 209Bi82+, the nuclear-polarization eﬀect contributes on the level of

about 0.05 meV. This implies that although numerical calculations of bound-state QED

corrections provide suﬃciently stable results, the conservative estimate of uncertainties for

the hfs splitting in 209Bi80+ quoted in Ref. [11] appears to be more realistic rather then the

one predicted in Ref. [12]. It is also worth noting that because of a similar scaling depen-

dence of nuclear and radiative corrections upon the principal quantum number, signiﬁcant

cancellations of almost all corrections, except for the screened QED contribution, occur in

a speciﬁc diﬀerence of the hfs splittings in H- and Li-like heavy ions [13].

In this case,

the nuclear-polarization eﬀect might be most relevant for determining the uncertainties of

accurate theoretical predictions.

The symmetric group S6 that permutes the six ﬁve-fold
axes of an icosahedron is introduced to go beyond the simple
rotations that constitute the icosahedral group I. Owing to
the correspondence h ↔ d, the calculation of the Coulomb
energies for the icosahedral conﬁgurations hN
based on the
sequence O(5) ⊃ S6 ⊃ S5 ⊃ I can be brought to bear on
Racah’s classic theory for the atomic d shell based on SO(5) ⊃
SOL(3) ⊃ I. Among the elements of S6 is the kaleidoscope
operator K that rotates the weight space of SO(5) by π
2 . Its
use explains some puzzling degeneracies in d3 involving the
spectroscopic terms 2P, 2F, 2G and 2H.

One of the most enduring mysteries in the theoretical
analysis of the atomic d shell was noticed over 60 years
ago by Condon and Shortley [1]. They remarked that the
non-relativistic Coulomb energies for the terms 2P and
2H of d3 are degenerate, but they did not ask why. The
degeneracy can be brought into focus by breaking the
Coulomb interaction into three parts ei (i = 0, 1, 2), fol-
lowing the work of Racah [2]. Both e0 and e1 are scalars
with respect to SO(5), the rotation group spanning the
ﬁve orbital states of a d electron, and for these two op-
erators the degeneracy is expected. However, e2 belongs
to the irreducible representation (IR) (22) of SO(5), and
there is no reason to anticipate the theoretical result

which is moderately well observed in the spectra of
transition-metal ions [3]. Advances in the analyses of
such spectra have revealed similar equalities over the
years. For example, interactions between dN and other
conﬁgurations can be represented by operators acting
within the d shell on more than two electrons at a time,
and the three-electron operator t3 belonging to the IR
(30) of SO(5) has been found to satisfy the equations [4]

Work on the icosahedral molecule C60 has revived in-
terest in the atomic d shell. This has come about be-
cause, on restricting the rotation group SO(3) in ordi-
nary space to its icosahedral subgroup I, the ﬁve orbital
components of a d electron serve as a basis for the IR
H of I. (This IR is distinguished from the spectroscopic

↔

term 2H by italicizing it.) The other IRs of I are A, T1, T2
and G, of dimensions 1,3,3 and 4 respectively. Following
convention, we use lower-case letters for individual elec-
tron states. Last year, Oliva [5] took advantage of the
correspondence hN
dN to study the Coulomb energies
of the icosahedral conﬁguration h3. Instead of the three
SO(3) scalars ei of Racah, he found that there were ﬁve
two-electron icosahedral scalars, three of which coincide
with Racah’s operators. In spite of the existence now of
k (called molecular
ﬁve operators of various strengths
invariants by Oliva), it turns out that, for any choice of
k, one of the two 2T1 levels always coincides with a 2T2
H
level. The eigenfunction of that 2T1 level is a mixture
of states that, in the atomic picture, correspond to 2P
and 2H, and which therefore appear to be connected to
Eqs.(1) and (2) above. Oliva speculated that an addi-
tional symmetry operation transforming 2H into 2P and
vice versa should exist. It is this kind of possibility that
we wish to explore in the present Letter.

H

↔

Because of the correspondence h

d, any problem
for hN can be recast for dN . The advantage of using d
electrons lies in being able to call upon the familiar theory
for SO(3). Each of the two new Coulomb operators, for
example, can be expressed in terms of the components
of a spherical tensor T (6) (this having the lowest nonzero
rank that can provide an icosahedral scalar [6]). We write

2√5) and
3 are deﬁned by taking (a, b) = (4,
(10, 2√5) respectively, and correspond to the IRs (22)
and (40) of SO(5). Such operators represent the eﬀect
to second-order in perturbation theory of a d-shell atom
placed in an electric ﬁeld of icosahedral symmetry, there
being no ﬁrst-order eﬀect because an electric potential of
rank 6 cannot split a d state.

If, on the other hand, we work with molecular h or-
bitals, the two operators e(6)
(together with
2
e0, e1 and e2) represent the ﬁrst-order Coulomb inter-
action between the pairs (i, j) of electrons. To have an
image of an h orbital, we follow Plakhutin [7], who con-
structed icosahedral g orbitals by superposing atomic s

(Ψn +
orbitals, we can reduce the basis to six pairs
n) of identical atomic s orbitals Ψ on opposite ends
Ψ13
−
(n and 13
n) of the 6 ﬁve-fold axes of an icosahedron.
This is shown in Fig. 1. There is only one complication:
the 6 pairs can be combined to produce the icosahedral
n Ψn. The ﬁve remaining combinations have to
scalar
be orthogonalized to this scalar to produce an h state.

−

The details of how this is done are not important
because our interest lies in the permutations of the 6
axes among themselves. These operations comprise the
symmetric group S6. Among these operations are those
that describe rotations of the icosahedron as a whole,
I. But there are many operations that twist
so S6 ⊃
the icosahedron out of shape and are non-feasible. The
n Ψn is untouched; that is, it belongs to the IR
scalar
[6] of S6, in the notation of Littlewood [8]. However, the
components of the h state undergo transformations that
span the IRs (10)− of O(5) and [51] of its subgroup S6
[9]. Branching rules for some of the IRs of O(5) occurring
in hN are set out in Table I.

P

The fact that I is isomorphic to the alternating group
A5 [10], a subgroup of S5 and thus of S6 too, allows us
to include it in the sequence

which can be considered an alternative to the more fa-

The IRs of S5 contained in a particular IR [λ] of S6 can
be found by interpreting [λ] as a Young tableau and then
removing from it a single cell in all possible ways that
leave an acceptable shape, with the proviso that the au-

again interchanges the states T1 and T2, and we can now
see that there must be as many T1 as T2 states for any

used. As for the states (11),

The icosahedral scalars that appear in the Hamiltonian
fall into four categories. They belong to [6][5]A, [23][5]A,
[32][15]A or [16][15]A. The ﬁrst two are invariant under
transformation, while the last two change sign.
the
operation belongs to the class (124) and (14) of
The
S6 and S5 (in the notation of Littlewood [8]), but it does
not belong to I. The characters of S6 or S5 indicate
0(mod 5))
whether the A component (for which ML
≡
is invariant or changes sign. We can now use S6 and S5
to recast the three Coulomb operators e2, e(6)
and e(6)
3 .

The ﬁrst two belong to the IR (22)+ of O(5), which,
from Table I, can be combined into operators belonging
2 e(6)
to [23][5]A and [32][15]A. They are given by 1

and 1

count for their non-vanishing matrix elements often tak-
ing complementary block forms. The exception is the
T1,2 states; they belong to the self-conjugate IR [312] of
S5, which allows both the scalar [5] and the pseudo-scalar
[15] to be non-vanishing at the same time. The operator
e(6)
3 belongs to (40)+[6][5], and is therefore diagonal in
the S6 basis. This operator e(6)

have three pairs of T1,2 degenerate levels if they were the
only operators in the Hamiltonian. The presence of the

remaining operator e2 −

incompletely; leaving us a single T1,2 degeneracy as found
by Oliva [5].

It sometimes happens that the (S6, S5) classiﬁcation of
a state coincides with that provided by SOL(3). In h3,
for example, the 4P term can be labelled by [313][312]T1
(see the ﬁrst column of Table II). An unexpected double

labelling occurs for 2F and 2H terms, whose T2 compo-
nents are [321][312] and [412][312] respectively. To prove
this, we ﬁrst combine the two equations (with ML = 0

and note that the only state on the left that can contain
2T2 is [321], since the only other possibility that [51]
×
[412] can give rise to is [412] (see [14]), and this is excluded
by (16). On the right of (17), however, no 2H can be
produced from angular momenta of 2 and 1; and so the
missing term [412]2T2 is purely 2H, and [321]2T2 can only
belong to the remaining source, namely 2F.

The L-purity of the 2T2 states of h3 leads to an expla-
nation for Eqs. (2) and (3). The branching (6) for the IR
(30)+ of O(5) yields the labels [23][5]A and [16][15]A for

The success of this analysis suggests that it could be re-
peated to obtain Eq. (1). However, the analog of Eq. (18)
cannot come directly from S6 because the required null
matrix element, although appearing in Table II, is not a
consequence of a selection rule for the IRs of S6. How-
ever, S6 immediately yields Eq. (18) for e(6)
3 , indicating
that all we need to do is prove this equation for either
of the two operators prefaced by a and b in Eq. (5). If

(21)

(22)

we pick the second and separate both this operator and
the two states 2F and 2H into spin-up and spin-down
parts (distinguished by the symbols A and B [15]), we
are ultimately led to calculate a matrix element of the

What the above analysis shows is that insight into the
properties of a free atom, which are based on SO(3) sym-
metry, can be gained by using the intrinsic icosahedral
symmetry of SO(3) and, more signiﬁcantly, the spatial
distortions associated with the group S6 that permutes
the axes of the icosahedron. We are reluctant to assert
that any aspect of the theory we have presented can be
thought of as being caused by another part, since the
theory forms an interlocking whole. Nevertheless, it is
remarkable that some long-standing puzzles in the clas-
sic theory of atomic structure should receive explanations
when S6 is brought into play.

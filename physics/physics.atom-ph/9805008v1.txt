ABSTRACTS The features of the low-lying spectrum and a complete set of
quantum numbers for the (e+e+e−e−) system have been deduced based on symme-
try. The existence of a low odd-parity L=1 excited state with the two e− coupled
to s1 = 0, and two e+ coupled to s2 = 1 (or s1 =1 and s2 =0) and a low even-
parity L=0 excited state with s1 = s2 = 1 have been anticipated. A 2-dimensional
(e+e+e−e−) system has also been discussed.

The systems composed of a few electrons and positrons are known to exist in
nature. The existence of the (e+e−) with inﬁnite bound states is obvious. The
(e+e−e−) or (e+e+e−) has been investigated by many authors. In 1977 Hill proved
that these two 3-body systems are bound [1]. The ground states and a number of
resonances have been identiﬁed ([2,3] and references there in). For the (e+e+e−e−)
a direct experimental observation has not yet been reported. However, a few the-
oretical calculations [4-8] indicate that this system is bound. A recent (and more
accurate) calculation reports that the ground state has an energy E0 = -0.515989
(atomic units are used in this paper) and a radius r0 =3.608 [8]. From r0 one can
estimate the moment of inertia I0 of the ground state. It was found that the ¯h2
2I0
is only about 1
50 |E0|. Since for Coulombic systems the excited states would be in
general much larger than the ground state in size (as shown in [6]), it implies that
an excitation of collective rotation is very easy to realize in an excited state due to
having a large moment of inertia. . Therefore, besides the orbital angular momen-
tum L=0 resonances predicted before [5,6], the existence of a number of resonances
with L6= 0 is very possible. Thus, the spectrum of the (e+e+e−e−) would be rich.
However, a precise calculation is diﬃcult. Before solving the Schr¨odinger equation,
if the qualitative feature can be more or less understood, it would be very helpful
to understand the coming results from experiments and theoretical calculations. It
is believed that symmetry will play an essential role in the spectrum. Based on the
permutation symmetry, Kinghorn and Poshusta have proposed a primary scheme
for the classiﬁcation of states [6]. On the other hand, the feature of a quantum
state depends on how the wave function is distributed in the coordinate space. It
turns out that the distribution is decisively aﬀected by symmetry (not only by the
permutation symmetry, as we shall see). In this paper the eﬀect of symmetry has
been investigated in detail, thereby the geometric feature of low-lying states has
been extracted, a complete set of quantum numbers (including those proposed in
[6]) has been introduced for the classiﬁcation.

Let H be the internal Hamiltonian for the (e+e+e−e−). Let particles 1 and 2
be electrons, 3 and 4 be positrons. It was pointed out by Kinghorn and Poshusta
that H is invariant under the permutations

((e)), ((12)), ((34)), ((12))((34)), p(1324), p(1423), ((13))((24)), and ((14))((23)),
here the ((12)) denotes an interchange of 1 and 2, p(1324) denotes a cyclic
permutation, etc.. These permutations form a subgroup of the S4 group isomorphic
to the point group D2d [6]. Therefore the eigenstates of H can be classiﬁed according
to the representations µ of the D2d group, µ = A1 , A2, B1, B2, or E. These
representations can be induced by the following idempotents:
8 [1 + ((13))((24))][1 + ((12))][1 + ((34))]
8 [1 − ((13))((24))][1 − ((12))][1 − ((34))]
8[1 + ((13))((24))][1 − ((12))][1 − ((34))]
8[1 − ((13))((24))][1 + ((12))][1 + ((34))]
4[1 − ((12))((34)) + ((13))((24)) − ((14))((23))]
4[1 − ((12))((34)) − ((13))((24)) + ((14))((23))]

eA1 = 1
eA2 = 1
eB1 = 1
eB2 = 1
eE11 = 1
eE22 = 1

(1,2)
(1,3)
(1,4)

(1,5)
(1,6)

Evidently, the sum of these six idempotents is equal to one.
On the other hand, H is also invariant under rotation and space inversion.
Besides, the total spin s1 of particles 1 and 2 and the total spin s2 of 3 and 4
are also good quantum numbers. Let the spatial wavefunctions of the eigenstates
be denoted as Ψ. Evidently, Ψ should be further classiﬁed according to the total
orbital angular momentum L, parity Π, s1 and s2. In particular, we have

((12))Ψ = (−1)s1Ψ
and
((34))Ψ = (−1)s2Ψ
Equations (2,1) and (2,2) are additional conditions imposed on the eigenstates

(2,2)

(2,1)

For an eigenstate Ψ belonging to the A1-representation,

it is evident from

of H.

eq.(1,1) that

((12))Ψ = Ψ, ((34))Ψ = Ψ, and ((13))((24))Ψ = Ψ
Therefore this state has s1=0, s2=0, and Λ=1, where Λ is the eigenvalue of
((13))((24)) . Similarly, the states belonging to the A2-representation have s1=1,
s2=1, and Λ = −1; the states of B1 have s1=1, s2=1, and Λ=1; and the states of
B2 have s1=0, s2=0, and Λ=−1 (cf. Table 1).

In the case of the E-representation, there are two degenerate states for an
eigenenergy. They can be denoted as eE11Ψ and ((12))eE11Ψ (or eE22Ψ and ((12))eE22Ψ).
However, neither the eE11Ψ nor the ((12)) eE11Ψ fulﬁlls (2.1) and (2.2), therefore
each of them is not a physical solution. Nonetheless, the two linear combinations

(3,1)

Ψa = [1 − ((12))]eE11Ψ
and
Ψb = [1 + ((12))]eE11Ψ
(3,2)
are physical solutions. One can prove that ((12))Ψa = −Ψa, ((34))Ψa = Ψa,
and ((13))((24))Ψa = Ψb. Therefore the Ψa has s1=1 and s2=0, but it does not have
the quantum number Λ. For convenience, this state is denoted as Λ=0. Similarly,
the Ψb has s1=0, s2=1, and Λ=0. The quantum numbers L,Π, and µ are suﬃcient
to label the symmetry of a series of states. Thus a state is labeled as LΠ
i {µ} in
the following, where i denotes the ordering of the state in the (LΠµ) series. More
explicitly, the spatial wavefunction of a LΠ
i {µ} state is denoted in more detail as
F LΠΛ
M,s1s2(1234), M is the Z-component of L. The relation between µ and the set
(s1s2Λ) is listed in Table 1.

.In order to facilitate the analysis, a body frame i’-j’-k’ is introduced. Then the

wave function can be expanded as

PQ DL

M,s1s2(1234) =

QM (−γ, −β, −α)F LΠΛ

F LΠΛ
where Q is the component of L along the third body axis k’, αβγ are the Euler
angles, DL
QM is the Wigner function of rotation. Here the (1234) and (1’2’3’4’)
specify that the coordinates are relative to a ﬁxed frame and to the body-frame,
Q,s1s2(1′2′3′4′) is called a Q-component. We shall show that the
respectively. F LΠΛ
Q-components are seriously constrained by symmetry.

Q,s1s2(1′2′3′4′)

Evidently, the distribution of the wave function in the coordinate space depends
ﬁrst on the interactions. For the (e+e+e−e−) system, if the particles form a shape
where the repulsive force between the pair of electrons (or positrons) can not be
over compensated by attractive force, then the shape is not important for low-
lying states , and the amplitude of wave function is expected to be small at this
shape. This is the case, e.g., that the particles form a regular tetrahedron or an
quadrilateral with the pair of electrons (positrons) located at adjacent vertexes.
On the other hand, if the particles form an quadrilateral with the pair of electrons
(positrons) located at the two ends of a diagonal, then the conﬁguration is favorable
to binding, where each repulsive bond can be over compensated. When the particles
form a square with the same kind of particles located at the two ends of each
diagonal, this particular conﬁguration is labeled as SQ hereafter.

Let the third body axis k’ be normal to the plane of the SQ, we have
(i) a rotation of the SQ about k’ by 180◦ is equivalent to a space inversion ,

thus we have

(−1)QF LΠΛ

Q,s1s2(SQ) = ΠF LΠΛ

Q,s1s2(SQ)

here the (SQ) implies that the coordinates form a SQ.
(ii) a rotation about k’ by 180◦ is equivalent to ((12))((34)) , thus we have

(8.2)

These equations impose a very strong constraint on F LΠΛ

Q,s1s2(SQ). If they can
not be fulﬁlled, F LΠΛ
Q,s1s2must be zero at the SQ. In this case, a nodal surface exists at
the SQ to prevent the Q-component F LΠΛ
Q,s1s2 from accessing the SQ. Evidently, this
nodal surface arises purely from symmetry, it is called an inherent nodal surface
[9,10]. The existence and the locations of the inherent nodal surfaces do not at
all depend on dynamics, it depends only on the transformation property of the
wavefunction under symmetric operations ( rotation, space inversion, and particle
permutation), this property is determined by the quantum numbers L,Π, and µ.
All the Q-components of the L≤ 2 states allowed to access the SQ are listed in
Tab.1, they are called SQ-accessible components.

All the other regular shapes in the neighborhood of the SQ have a weaker
geometric symmetry. For example, when a diagonal of a SQ becomes longer or
shorter, the shape becomes to a diamond. At this shape the equations (5) to (7)
hold, but (8) does not hold. Therefore the wavefunction is less constrained at the
diamonds. Hence, once a wavefunction can access the SQ, it can access a broad
domain surrounding the SQ. Therefore the SQ-accessible components are inherent
nodeless in this broad domain, where the distribution of wave function can be
optimized to favor binding.

When the particles form a straight chain with each adjacent pair separated
equidistantly and with each adjacent pair containing opposite charges, the conﬁg-
uration is denoted by CH. Evidently, at the CH, the repulsion can also be over
compensated by attraction. However, all the four attractive bonds at the SQ act
eﬀectively while only three bonds at the CH do. Thus, the CH is less favorable
than the SQ, and the domain surrounding the CH is the second important domain
for the low-lying states.

Let k’ be normal to and i’ be parallel to the straight chain, let the ordering of
the particles along the chain is 1423. Then, at the CH, a rotation about k’ by 180◦
is equivalent to a space inversion and also equivalent to p13p24, a rotation about i’
by an arbitrary angle δ causes no changes. Thus we have

where Li′ is the projection of L along i’. Evidently, (11) is fulﬁlled if

(12) can be rewritten as

(for all Q)

Q−1,s1s2(CH)

From this set of homogeneous linear equation, the F LΠΛ

Q,s1s2(CH) are not zero

only if

(−1)Q = (−1)L
From (9), (10), and (14) the CH-accessible components can be identiﬁed as
listed in Tab.1. Incidentally, for a state with L≥ 2, the components with diﬀerent
|Q| will be mixed up according to (13).

(14)

Let the LΠ

1 {µ} state, the lowest one of the (LΠµ) series, be called a ﬁrst-state
(the subscript i will be omitted if i = 1). It is well known that higher states in

general contain more nodal surfaces. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the
ﬁrst-states would prefer to contain nodal surfaces as least as possible. Therefore
they would be dominated by the component(s) containing least inherent nodal
surfaces. In this paper the analysis is based on the inherent nodal structure in the
two most important domain, i.e., the domain surrounding the SQ and the domain
surrounding the CH. There is no a sharp border to separate these domains. Owing
to the long range character of the Coulomb force, the distribution of the wave
functions is anticipated to be broad, and the wave functions will extend from one
domain to another. Hence, the component which is inherent nodeless in both the
SQ and CH domains is superior. In Table 1 there are four such superior components
denoted as SQ,CH. Accordingly, there are four states with L≤ 2 superior in binding.
Each of them is dominated by a superior component., where the wave function is
anticipated to be mainly distributed in the SQ-domain but extend to the CH-
domain without nodal surfaces. These states are called the SQ1-states as listed in
Table 2.

There is a type of component being SQ-accessible but CH-inaccessible (denoted
as SQ in Table 1). For the 1+{A2},2+{B2},2−{E}, this type of component is much
better than the other components of them. Thus these three ﬁrst-states would be
dominated by this type of component, and they are called the SQ2-states as listed
in Table 2. The internal energy of a SQ2-ﬁrst-state is higher than a SQ1-ﬁrst-state
because the former contains an inherent nodal surface while the latter does not. .
There is a type of component being SQ-inaccessible but CH-accessible. They
can be further classiﬁed into three kinds. The ﬁrst kind is not only CH-accessible
but also rectangle-accessible (denoted by CH1 in Table1). The states dominated
by this kind of components are the 0+{B1} and 2+{B1}, they are called the CH1-
states as listed in Table 2. The second kind denoted as CH2 in Table 1 is rectangle-
accessible if and only if the particles at the two ends of a diagonal have opposite
charges (otherwise,it is rectangle-inaccessible). The states dominated by this kind
of components are the 1−{A2} and 1−{B2}, they are called the CH2-states. The
third kind denoted as CH3 in Table 1 is rectangle-inaccessible (disregarding how
the particles are located at the vertexes). The states dominated by this kind
of components are the 0+{E} and 2+{E}, they are called the CH3-states. The
wavefunctions of the CH1-, CH2-, and CH3-ﬁrst-states would be mainly distributed
around a straight chain. Among them the internal energy of the CH1-ﬁrst-states
would be lower due to being rectangle-accessible, the CH3-ﬁrst states would be
higher due to being rectangle-inaccessible (thus more nodal surfaces are contained).
There is a type of components being both SQ- and CH-inaccessible but diamond-
accessible (denoted as D-S-D in Table 1). The 0+{B2}, 1+{B1}, and 2+{A2} would
be dominated by this type of component because they do not have a better choice.
In these states coplanar structure (e.g., a diamond) would exist. However, the
inherent nodal surface at the SQ will induce a coplanar oscillation back and forth
around the SQ, therefore the energy of these states are high. They are called the
D-S-D states listed in Table 2

There is a type of components being not allowed to access any coplanar struc-

ture, they also can not access the CH, but they can access a regular tetrahedron
(denoted as T-S-T in Table 1). The 0−{B1}, 1+{E}, · · · · · would be dominated
by this type of component, where the wavefunction is mainly distributed around
a tetrahedron. However, the inherent nodal surface at the coplanar structure will
induce an oscillation so that the tetrahedron would be transformed to another
tetrahedron via a coplanar structure. The energy of these states are also high.
They are called the T-S-T states listed in Table 2.

There is also a type of components being not allowed to access all the above
mentioned shapes, namely the SQ, rectangle, diamond, CH, and the regular tetra-
hedrons (denoted as a blank block in Table 1). This type is very unfavorable in
binding due to containing many nodal surfaces at the regular shapes. However, the
0+{A2}, 0−{A1}, · · · · ·states contain only this type of component. The energy of
these states must be very high. They are listed at the bottom of Table 2.

A complete classiﬁcation of the ﬁrst-states according to the inherent nodal
structure of their dominant component is given in Table 2. The L≥ 3 ﬁrst-states
can be classiﬁed as well. It is noted that in Table 2 the states in an upper row
contains fewer inherent nodal surface; the upper, the fewer. For the ﬁrst-states
with a given L, the ordering of their locations in Table 2 (in descending order) is
anticipated to be the ordering of their energies (in ascending order): the SQ1-states
at the top are the lowest which are essentially inherent nodeless, while the states
at the bottom are the highest which contain a number of inherent nodal surfaces
at regular shapes. Nonetheless, the SQ2- and CH1-states both contain essentially
one inherent nodal surface, therefore their ordering can not be simply determined
by symmetry. This is also the situation of the D-S-D and T-S-T states. In the
second-states and even higher states, in addition to inherent nodal surfaces, more
nodal surfaces arising from a pure dynamical reason (not from symmetry) will be
contained. We are not going to the details of these states. Nonetheless, they will
also be seriously aﬀected by the inherent nodal structure as listed in Table 1.

Incidentally, the collective rotation energy of a coplanar structure depends on
the orientation of the structure relative to L. When the third body axis k’ is normal
to the plane of the coplanar structure, the plane would be better normal to L in
a Q-component with a larger |Q|. Thus, for a coplanar shape, the larger the |Q|,
the larger the moment of inertia, and thereby the smaller the rotation energy. For
example, although both the 2+{B1} and 2+{A1} are SQ1-states with L=2, the
collective rotation energy of the former is smaller because the SQ structure would
appear in |Q|=2 component (refer to Table 1). This eﬀect would aﬀect the ordering
of levels. How serious is the eﬀect remains to be clariﬁed.

It is anticipated that the low-lying spectrum would be dominated by the SQ1-,
SQ2-, and CH1-states. In particular, the ground state would be the 0+{A1}. The
candidate of the ﬁrst excited state would be the odd-parity 1−{E} and the 0+{B1}.
The 1−{E} is two-fold degenerate because the (s1s2) has two choices (0,1) and (1,0).
The internal energy of the 0+{B1} as a CH1-state is higher than the 1−{E} as a
SQ1-state, however the 0+{B1} does not contain collective rotation energy, thus a
compensation can be gained. It is a pity that experimental and theoretical data

are so few that most of the predictions can not be checked at present. Nonetheless,
owing to the work by Kinghorn and Poshusta [6], the predictions on L=0 even-
parity states can be partially checked. The results from [6] are listed in Table 3 to
be compared with Table 2 and Table 1. In Table 3 the 0+{A1} is the lowest just as
anticipated. Besides, the ordering of levels is just as anticipated; i.e., the energies
of the SQ1-state, CH1-state, CH3-state, D-S-D state, and the state belonging to
the last row of Table 2 are in ascending order. Thus, in general, the spectrum from
[6] supports the above analysis and the classiﬁcation.

In the above analysis the features of the wavefunctions has been demonstrated.
Obviously, all these features deduced from symmetry consideration together with
the suggested classiﬁcation scheme need a further check. In particular, although
the analysis covers all the L≤ 2 states, it does not mean that all of them can be
experimentally observed. The observation depends on the width of the resonance,
which is a topic not yet touched in this paper.

The above discussion can be easily generalized to a 2-dimensional (e+e+e−e−)
system. In this case Π = (−1)L holds always, therefore the label Li{µ} is suﬃcient
to denote a state. The accessibility of the regular shapes to the Li{µ} states is
summarized in Table 4, which leads to a classiﬁcation of states as listed in Table
5. The ground state is also a 0{A1} state. There are three lower excited states,
namely the 1{E},0{A2} and 0{B1}). It is noticeable that the 0{A2} is now low.
This point is very diﬀerent from the 3-dimensional system where the 0+{A2} is
very high . We can further predict that the 2{B1} is the lowest L=2 state.

In the case of a 2-dimensional biexcitons in a quantum well [11], the eﬀec-
tive mass of the hole is not necessary equal to the mass of the particle, therefore
the Hamiltonian is no longer invariant to the D2d group. In this case, the above
discussion should be modiﬁed.

The procedure of analysis proposed in this paper is quite general for investi-
gating the qualitative feature of low-lying states. In fact it can be generalized to
investigate diﬀerent kinds of systems with diﬀerent numbers of particles [12-13]. In
any case, one has to clarify which domains in the coordinate space are important
(it depends on the interactions) to the low-lying states, and to clarify the inherent
nodal structure (it depends purely on symmetry) in these important domains. The
inherent nodal structure would provide a solid frame to classify the states. Based
on the inherent nodal structure, one can understand not only the behavior of an
individual system, but also the systematics of spectra and the similarity of diﬀerent
systems.

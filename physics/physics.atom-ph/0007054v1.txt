Abstract We propose an experiment to measure the
slow log(N ) convergence to mean-ﬁeld theory (MFT) around
a dynamical instability. Using a density matrix formalism, we
derive equations of motion which go beyond MFT and provide
accurate predictions for the quantum break-time. The leading
quantum corrections appear as decoherence of the reduced
single-particle quantum state.

A Bose-Einstein condensate is described in mean ﬁeld
theory (MFT) by a c-number macroscopic wave func-
tion, obeying the Gross-Pitaevskii non-linear Schr¨odinger
equation. MFT is closely analogous to the semiclassi-
cal approximation of single-particle quantum mechanics,
with the inverse square root of the number N of particles
in the condensate playing the role of ¯h as a perturbative
parameter. Since in current experimental condensates N
is indeed large, it is generally diﬃcult to see qualitatively
signiﬁcant quantum corrections to MFT. In the vicinity
of a dynamical instability in MFT, however, quantum
corrections appear on timescales that grow only loga-
rithmically with N . In this paper we propose an exper-
iment to detect such quantum corrections, and present
a simple theory to predict them. We show that, as the
Gross-Pitaevskii classical limit of a condensate resembles
single-particle quantum mechanics, so the leading quan-
tum corrections appear in the single-particle picture as
decoherence.

We will consider a condensate in which particles can
only eﬀectively populate two second-quantized modes.
This model can be realized with a condensate in a double
well potential [1–6], or with an eﬀectively two-component
spinor condensate [7,8] whose internal state remains uni-
form in space. Such uniformity can be ensured, to a
good approximation, by conﬁning a very cold condensate

within a size much smaller than [n|√a11a22 − a12|]−1/2,

where n is the mean total density and aij is the s-wave
scattering length between atoms in internal states i and
j. The kinetic energy of spin non-uniformity then ensures
that the spatial state of the condensate will adiabatically
follow its internal state, which will evolve on slower time
scales. Dynamical instabilities to phase separation are
also frustrated in this regime, which since for available
alkali gases all aij diﬀer only by a few percent, could
be reached with small condensates (N ≤ 104) in weak,
nearly spherical traps (ω ≤ 100 Hz). Stronger or less
isotropic traps reach the two-mode regime at smaller N .
In the double well realization, the nonlinear interac-
tion may be taken to aﬀect only atoms within the same
well. In this case single-particle tunneling provides a lin-
ear coupling between the two modes, which can in princi-

1

ple be tuned over a wide range of strengths. Two internal
states may be coupled by a near-resonant radiation ﬁeld
[9,10]. If collisions do not change spin states, there is also
a simple nonlinear interaction in the internal realization.
In either case the total number operator commutes with
the Hamiltonian, and may be replaced with the c-number
N . Discarding c-number terms, we may therefore write
the two-mode Hamiltonian

where ω is the coupling strength between the two con-
densate modes, η is the two-body interaction strength,
and ˆa1, ˆa†
2 are particle annihilation and creation
operators for the two modes. We will take η and ω to be
positive, since the relative phase between the two modes
may be re-deﬁned arbitrarily, and since without dissipa-
tion the overall sign of H is insigniﬁcant.

Instead of considering the evolution of ˆaj and its ex-
pectation value in a symmetry-breaking ansatz, we will
examine the evolution of the directly observable quan-
tities ˆa†
i ˆaj, whose expectation values deﬁne the reduced
single particle density matrix (SPDM) Rij ≡ hˆa†
i ˆaji/N .
It is convenient to introduce the Bloch representation, by
deﬁning the angular momentum operators,

Mean ﬁeld trajectories ~s(t) at four diﬀerent κ/ω ratios are
plotted in Fig. 1. The norm of ~s is conserved in MFT,
and so for an initially pure SPDM, (6) are equivalent to
the two-mode Gross-Pitaevskii equation [4].

FIG. 1. Mean-ﬁeld trajectories at (a)κ = 0, (b)κ = 1.02ω,

(c)κ = 2ω, and (d)κ = 20ω.

The nonlinear Bloch equations (6) depict a competi-
tion between linear Rabi oscillations in the SySz-plane
and nonlinear oscillations in the SxSy-plane. For a non-
interacting condensate (Fig. 1a) the trajectories on the
Bloch sphere are circles about the Sx axis, correspond-
ing to harmonic Rabi oscillations. As κ increases the
oscillations become more anharmonic until, above the
critical value κ = ω (Fig.
1b), the stationary point
~s = (−1, 0, 0) becomes dynamically unstable, and macro-
scopic self-trapping can occur (oscillations with a non-
vanishing time averaged population imbalance hSzit 6= 0)
[4].
In the vicinity of the dynamically unstable point,
MFT will break down on a time scale only logarithmic
in N , and so an improved theory is desirable.

If we assume that the condensate remains mildly frag-
mented, so that the two eigenvalues of Rij are f and
1 − f for small f , we can take ˆLi = Li + ˆδLi, where
the c-number Li is O(N ) and, throughout the Hilbert
subspace through which the system will evolve, all ma-
trix elements of ˆδLi are no greater than O(N√f ). The

second order moments

∆ij = 4N −2(cid:16)h ˆLi ˆLj + ˆLj ˆLii − 2h ˆLiih ˆLji(cid:17) ,

(7)

will then be of order f . We can retain these, and so
improve on MFT, if we truncate the BBGKY hierarchy of
expectation value equations of motion at one level deeper:
we eliminate the approximation (5), and instead impose

h ˆLi ˆLj ˆLki ≈ h ˆLi ˆLjih ˆLki + h ˆLiih ˆLj ˆLki + h ˆLi ˆLkih ˆLji

− 2h ˆLiih ˆLjih ˆLki .

(8)

This approximation is accurate to within a factor 1 +
O(f 3/2), better than (5) by one factor of f 1/2. Succes-
sively deeper truncations of the hierarchy yield system-
atically better approximations as long as f is small.

Applying (7) and (8) to (4), we obtain the following set
of equations, in which the mean ﬁeld Bloch vector drives
the ﬂuctuations ∆ij , and is in turn subject to backreac-
tion from them:

˙Sx = −κSzSy −
˙Sy = ωSz + κSzSx +
˙Sz = −ωSy
˙∆xz = −ω∆xy − κSz∆yz − κSy∆zz
˙∆yz = ω(∆zz − ∆yy) + κSz∆xz + κSx∆zz
˙∆xy = (ω + κSx)∆xz − κSy∆yz + κSz(∆xx − ∆yy)
˙∆xx = −2κSy∆xz − 2κSz∆xy
˙∆yy = 2(ω + κSx)∆yz + 2κSz∆xy
˙∆zz = −2ω∆yz .

(9)

In what follows, we will refer to (9) as evolution under
‘Bogoliubov backreaction’ (BBR).

We note that (9) are actually identical to the equations
of motion one would obtain, for the same quantities, us-
ing the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Gaussian ansatz. And
if the second-order moments ∆ij may initially be factor-
ized as ∆ij = δiδj (i, j = x, y, z), then the factorization
persists and the time evolution of δx, δy, and δz is equiv-
alent to that of perturbations of the mean-ﬁeld equations
(6):

˙δx = −κ(Szδy + Syδz) ,
˙δy = ωδz + κ(Szδx + Sxδz) ,
˙δz = −ωδy .

(10)

Thus our equations for ∆ij are in a sense equivalent to the
usual Bogoliubov equations. The quantitative advantage
of our approach therefore lies entirely in the wider range
of initial conditions that it admits, which may more accu-
rately represent the exact initial conditions. For instance,
a Gaussian approximation will have ∆xx = O(1) in the
ground state, where in fact ∆xx = O(N −1). This leads
to an error of order N −1/2 in the Josephson frequency
computed by linearizing (9) around the ground state,
which is problematic because one would hope that the
Gaussian backreaction result would be accurate at this
order. Our SPDM approach avoids this problem, which is
presumably the two-mode analogue of the Hartree-Fock-
Bogoliubov spectral gap [11].

For ﬁnite motion of the Bloch vector, our formalism
oﬀers an eﬃcient method to depict the back-reaction of
the Bogoliubov equations on the mean ﬁeld equations via
the coupling terms −κ∆yz/2 and κ∆xz/2 in (9). Because
in general ∆yz(t) 6= ∆xz(t), this back-reaction has the ef-
fect of breaking the unitarity of the mean-ﬁeld dynamics.
Consequently, the BBR trajectories are no longer con-
ﬁned to the surface of the Bloch sphere, but penetrate to
the interior (representing mixed-state Rij , with two non-
zero eigenvalues). Thus although decoherence is gener-
ally considered as suppressing quantum eﬀects, decoher-
ence of the single particle quantum state of a condensate
is itself the leading quantum correction (due to interpar-
ticle entanglement) to the eﬀectively classical MFT.

and solving Eq. (4) numerically, using a Runge-Kutta
algorithm. The results for an initial state where all par-
ticles are in one of the modes (corresponding to the ini-
tial conditions Sx = Sy = 0, Sz = −1, ∆xx = −∆yy =
2/N, ∆xy = ∆xz = ∆yz = ∆zz = 0) and κ = 2ω are
shown in Fig. 2. The MFT trajectory passes through the
dynamically unstable point ~s = (−1, 0, 0). Consequently,
the quantum trajectory sharply breaks away from the
MFT trajectory as it approaches this point, entering the
Bloch sphere interior. While still periodic on a much
shorter time scale than the exact evolution, the BBR evo-
lution (dashed curve) provides an excellent prediction of
the time at which the break from MFT takes place (the
’quantum break time’).

ticles in one mode, at κ = 2ω.

In order to conﬁrm this decoherence, and demonstrate
how the BBR equations (9) improve on the mean-ﬁeld
equations (6), we compare the trajectories obtained by
these two formalisms to exact quantum trajectories, ob-
tained by ﬁxing the total number of particles N = 50

and 320 (- - - -) particles. Initial conditions are the same as

of the exact reduced single-particle density operator, as a
function of the rescaled time ωt with N=10,20,40,80,160,
and 320 particles, for the same initial conditions as in
Fig. 2. Since the MFT entropy is always zero, S serves
as a measure of convergence. The quantum break time
is clearly evident, and indeed increases as log(N ). The
single-particle entropy is measurable, in the internal state
realization of our model, by applying a fast Rabi pulse
and measuring the amplitude of the ensuing Rabi oscil-
lations, which is proportional to the Bloch vector length
|~s|. (Successive measurements with Rabi rotations about
diﬀerent axes, i.e. by two resonant pulses diﬀering by

a phase of π/2, will control for the dependence on the
angle of ~s). In a double well realization, one could deter-
mine the single-particle entropy by lowering the potential
barrier, at a moment when the populations on each side
were predicted to be equal, to let the two parts of the
condensate interfere. The fringe visibility would then be
proportional to |~s|. Since |~s| at a ﬁxed time depends ex-
ponentially on η, such experiments could also potentially
be used to measure scattering lengths.

FIG. 4. Time at which S reaches 0.2 as a function of the
particle number N , according to the BBR equations (9), mod-
iﬁed to include thermal phase-diﬀusion. Four diﬀerent values
of Γ are shown: Γ = 0 (—–), Γ = 10−4ω (· · ·), Γ = 10−3ω
(− − −), and Γ = 10−2ω (− · −). Exact quantum results are
presented for Γ = 0 (circles) and Γ = 10−2ω (squares). Initial
conditions, κ and ω are the same as in Figs. 2 and 3.

Decoherence of quantum systems coupled to reservoirs
shows similar behaviour to Fig. (3). The entropy of a dy-
namically unstable quantum system coupled to a reser-
voir [12], or of a stable system coupled to a dynami-
cally unstable reservoir, is predicted to grow linearly with
time, at a rate independent of the system-reservoir cou-
pling, after an onset time proportional to the logarithm
of the coupling. This shows that one can really consider
the Bogoliubov ﬂuctuations as a reservoir [13], coupled
to the mean ﬁeld with a strength proportional to 1/N .
But one can also consider decoherence due to a genuine
reservoir (unobserved degrees of freedom, as opposed to
unobserved higher moments). For example, thermal par-
ticles scattering oﬀ the condensate mean ﬁeld will cause
phase diﬀusion [14] at a rate Γ which may be estimated
in quantum kinetic theory as proportional to the ther-
mal cloud temperature. For internal states not entan-
gled with the condensate spatial state, Γ may be as low
as 10−5 Hz under the coldest experimental conditions,
whereas for a double well the rate may reach 10−1 Hz.
Further sources of decoherence may be described phe-
nomenologically with a larger Γ. Evolving the full N -
particle density matrix under the appropriate quantum

4

kinetic master equation [3], we again solve for ~s either nu-
merically or in BBR approximation. In Fig. 4 we show
the time at which the entropy reaches a given value, as a
function of the number of particles, for various Γ, accord-
ing to the modiﬁed BBR equations. The exact quantum
results (limited by computation power to N ∼ 103) are
presented for the two limiting values of Γ, showing excel-
lent agreement with the BBR predictions. These results
can of course be interpreted as a quantum saturation of
the dephasing rate at low temperature.

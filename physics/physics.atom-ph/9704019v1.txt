Introduction

A recent paper [1] demonstrated the existence of a family of closed-form solutions to
the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation for the potential

(4)

which is widely used [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] in the modeling of atomic response to strong time-
dependent radiation ﬁelds. The approach used in Ref. [1] was somewhat analogous to
the Sturmian method [9] for generating a complete basis set of Coulomb wavefunctions,
in which the energy E is held ﬁxed and the nuclear charge Z is determined as an
[1] determined “eigenvalues” an of the cutoﬀ parameter a, for which
eigenvalue. Ref.

these are the energies of the states of the three- dimensional hydrogen atom, in the usual
system of atomic units (used throughout the present paper) in which the numerical
value of unity is assigned to the mass m and charge e of the electron and to the reduced
Planck’s constant ¯h. The associated eigenfunctions Ψn(x) were found to have a closed-
form expression:

Ψn(x) = xνe−κχfn(χ),

This potential arises in the Kramers-Hennenberger transformation of the equations of
motion of a hydrogen atom in a radiation ﬁeld [10, 11], and it is qualitatively similar to
some pseudopotentials used in density-functional calculations of electronic structure (e.g.
Ref. [12]). It is shown here that, subject to an assumption similar to one made in Ref.
[1], the Schr¨odinger equation for this potential admits an inﬁnite number of closed-form
solutions for each value of the angular momentum l. The lowest-energy solutions for
each l are quite simple, so knowledge of these exact results may be useful for calibrating
numerical methods that must be used to solve general equations of this type. To the best
of the author’s knowledge, these are the ﬁrst exact results for Schr´odinger eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions for potenials of the class described by Eq. (4).

2. Method of solution

The extension of the method of [1] is straightforward. We proceed from the Schr¨odinger
equation

is obtained. We now postulate a solution of the form

φl(ρ) = e−κρ

ciρi,

n

Xi=0

where n is an integer to be determined. For economy of expression the dependence of κ
and ci upon n and l is not made explicit in the notation, but it is held to be implicit.

We now show that Eq.

(8) does not provide a general solution, but that it is
applicable for discrete values of α. To see this, we substitute eq. (8) in the l.h.s. of
Eq. (7), and require the net coeﬃcient of each power of ρ to vanish identically. The
coeﬃcient of ρj that emerges from this operation is

α2(j + 4)(j + 2)cj+4 + α2κ(2j + 5)cj+3 +

1. Thus we must solve the n + 3 simultaneous equations (9)

κ(j + l + 2)) cj+1 = 0

(9)

We proceed by treating Eq. (9) as a four-term recurrence relation, and solve for
1. Because cj = 0 for j > n, the solution for

Thus κ is uniquely determined by n and l. Eq. (10) describes exactly the spectrum of
the three-dimensional Coulomb potential, i.e. the limiting case of Eq. (5) with a = 0; in

= 0, we must have n

that case n coresponds to the number of nodes in the radial eigenfunction. We shall see
subsequently that, for α
1, and the maximum number of radial
nodes in the wavefunction described by Eqs. (8) and (10) is n
1. The potential of Eq.
(4) has a long-range Coulomb tail and a non-Coulombic component at small r, so its
Schr¨odinger spectrum is naturally described in the language of quantum defect theory
[13]. In that terminology, Eq. (10) describes a state with an integer value of the quantum
defect µ, which is necessarily negative for a
= 0. The following development will indicate
that all eigenfunctions with integral quantum defects obtained with potentials of the
class Eq. (4) are described by Eq. (8).

≥

−

Since Eq. (7) is homogeneous, we can set cn = 1 without loss of generality. The
values of ci for i < n are then determined in terms of cn by downward recursion using
Eq. (9). For j = n

2, we get

−

cn−1 =

n(n + l + 1)(n + 2l + 1)

cn = p1(α2)cn,

(11)

α2
n + l + 1 !

−

where p1(x) designates a ﬁrst-degree polynomial in x. From this equation it is apparent
that there will be a solution for n = 0 only if α = 0, which is the familiar Coulombic
case.

Inspection of the structure of Eq. (9) shows that by continuing the recursion process

downward in j we get

cn−m = pm(α2)cn,

with pm(α2) being a polynomial of degree m in α2. So for j = 0 and j =

1 we ﬁnd

c1 = pn−1(α2)cn

and

c0 = pn(α2)cn

respectively. The last two cases to be considered are j =
found to give the same equation:

−

2 and j =

3. These are

−

−

c1 = κc0 =

c0
n + l + 1

.

Thus, from Eqs. (13) and (14), we see that Eq. (8) will provide a valid solution if

qn(α2) = pn(α2)

(n + l + 1)pn−1(α2) = 0

−

or, in other words, if α2 is a root of the nth degree polynomial qn.

The applicability of Eq. (8) thus depends upon some roots of Eq. (15) being positive
real numbers. The investigation reported here has not uncovered a general proof that
Eq. (15) has any such roots, but calculations carried out for l
20 suggest
that all its roots are positive real numbers and are nondegenerate. Let us adopt this as
a hypothesis. If it is true, then the following statements hold:

i. For each l, n there are n + 1 values of α2 for which Eq. (5) has solutions of the
form Eqs. (6, 8). This includes the previously-known (Coulombic) value α2 = 0, plus
the n roots of the polynomial qn.

ii. The only potentials of the class eq. (4) which have bound states with Coulombic
energies are just those with values of α2 that are solutions to Eq. (15). This is because
Eq. (4) describes a monotonic function of α2. Thus, for a given l, its associated discrete
Schr¨odinger eigenvalues will increase uniformly towards zero as α increases. For a given
l, Z, and Coulombic energy,

Enl =

1
2

Z 2
(n + l + 1)2 ,

−

there will be some maximum value of α2 for which Enl occurs as an eigenvalue, i.e., that
for which it is the lowest eigenvalue. As α2 is decreased from this maximum, Enl will
next occur in the spectrum when it is the second lowest eigenvalue, then as the third
lowest, etc., until ﬁnally at α2 = 0, when it is the (n + 1)-th lowest eigenvalue. Thus
there are indeed only n + 1 values of α2 for which Eq. (16) occurs in the spectrum,
which is consistent with the stated hypothesis, and if the hypothesis is true, these values
must thus coincide with the roots of Eq. (15)

The argument ii.

is illustrative of the actual results of computations of solutions
of Eqs. (9) and (15), as will be described below. The largest value of α2 for a given
(n, l) is associated with a nodeless eigenfunction; the next largest value of α2, with
an eigenfunction with one node; and so on to the smallest nonzero value of α2, which
corresponds to an eigenfunction with n

1 nodes.

−

The eigenvalues of α2 can be easily be found for a given (n, l) by numerical solution of
the polynomial equation (15). They have relatively simple closed forms for n = 1 and 2,
which are presented here. Numerical tables are given below for 1

3. Results

3.1. n = 1

For n = 1 we obtain

α2 = 2(l + 2)3,

c0 = l + 2,

c1 = 1,

so that the (nonnormalized) solution of Eq. (5) is

ψl(r) = rle−ρ/(l+2) (l + 2 + ρ) ,

with ρ =

(Zr)2 + 2(l + 2)3, and a2 = Z −2α2 = Z −22(l + 2)3 .

For n = 2 there are two solutions for α2:

α2 =



(l + 3)3.

With the choice of c2 = 1, we can write the expressions for the two sets of coeﬃcients
ci in the common form:

c0 =

(l + 3)2(2l + 3),

c1 =

with the value of α2 to be chosen as appropriate.

3.3. n > 2

Although closed-form expressions can be obtained for α2 and ci for n = 3 and 4, they
have the typical cumbersome form of roots of cubic and quartic equations, and it does not
seem particularly useful to record them here in full. However, a simplifying relationship
is worth noting. For these values of n, the values of α2 can be written as

α2 = (n + l + 1)3(n + 1 + β),

where β is a root of the polynomials,

for n = 3 and 4, respectively. In the limit of large l, the solutions of Eqs. (22) and (23)
tend respectively to β = 0,

3. Thus from Eqs. (17-23) we see that for
±
large l, the smallest value of α2 tends to α2 = 2(n + l + 1)3 for n = 1 through 4. This
motivates the choice of Eq. (21) as a general representation for the values of α2, and it
has been used to record those values in the tables given below. It has been found that,
to a high degree of numerical accuracy, the computed values of β for a given (n, l) sum
to zero, so that substituting β = 0 in eq. 21 apparently locates α2 = (n + l + 1)3(n + 1)
as the average of the values of α2. No fundamental explanation of this apparent fact is
advanced here.

Tables 1, 2, 3 give the values of β for n

for l = 0 can be found in Table 1 of Ref. [1], so they are not repeated here [14].

3.4. Systematic behavior of wavefunctions

Numerical calculations indicate that the wavefunctions described by Eq. (8) exhibit the
qualitative behavior discussed at the end of Sec. 2. For a given (n, l), denote by αk
the kth smallest value of α obtained in solving Eq. (15), with k = 1, 2, ..., n. Numerical
k radial
experiments indicate that the wavefunction corresponding to αk has nr = n
nodes, a pattern that was observed in the one-dimensional cases treated in ref. [1]. An
example of this behavior is illustrated in Fig. 1 for the case n = 10, l = 1.

Fig. 2 depicts the values of αk for 0

the eﬀective principal quantum number of atomic spectroscopy, which is related to the
energy via Eq. (10). For a given (l, k), as labelled in Fig. 2, a discernable sequence
of values of αk is observed; these sequences are seen to approach deﬁnite limits as n
∗
increases. This is related to the well-known phenomenon in atomic spectroscopy in which
quantum defects tend to constant values high in Rydberg series. The slow variations of
high-n quantum defects are due to the presence of a ﬁxed, short-range, non-Coulombic
part of the potential experienced by a Rydberg electron. Correspondingly, the ﬁxed
value of quantum defect obtained in the present method is associated with slow variation
of αk at large n.

For large α2 and large k, on the other hand, the eigenfunctions approach those of the
three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. This can be seen by expanding Z/√r2 + a2 in
powers of r/a for large a; retaining the lowest two terms gives the Schr¨odinger equation
If ﬁrst-order perturbation theory is used to include the

. Fig. 3 is a correlation diagram that displays the connection between this
limit and the hydrogenic limit a = 0, if one keeps the number of radial nodes, nr,
ﬁxed as a varies. Two familiar cases of l-degeneracy are apparent in this ﬁgure: nρ + l
= constant for the hydrogen atom, and 2nρ + l = constant for the three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator.

3.5. The spectrum for large values of l and a

In sec. 3.3 it was mentioned that as l
4.
Thus in this limit we recover a case of near-l-degeneracy similar to that encountered in
hydrogen: there are values of α that support degenerate eigenfunctions with diﬀerent
values of l, described as a class by the equation nr + l = constant. The approach to this
limit is relatively slow, apparently like l−1 as suggested by Eq. (19): e.g. for l = 10, 000

10, the actual value of α changes by about a part in 104 for a unit change in
and n
nr at constant nr + l. Numerical experiments suggest that this approximate degeneracy
is a general phenomenon at large l.

There is a simple eﬀect of this kind of degeneracy for all potentials that have a long-
range Coulomb tail and some non-Coulombic behavior localized at small r.
In such
systems, the centrifugal barrier presented to a high-l wavefunction - commonly called
a “nonpenetrating orbital” - will prevent it from sampling the non-Coulombic region.
Thus the Coulombic l-degeneracy is largely undisturbed for large l. The quantum defects
µl of nonpenetrating orbitals tend to zero as l
, a phenomenon that is universal
in actual atomic systems, where, apart from isolated instances of series perturbation,
observed quantum defects are hardly greater than 0.01 for l

→ ∞

5 .

However, the eﬀect encountered in the present system is quite diﬀerent. The non-
Coulombic behavior of the potential extends to very large r, so the large-l eigenfunctions
are substantially modiﬁed from their Coulombic forms:
their quantum defects are
negative integers. The appearance of this novel l-degeneracy presumably derives from
the existence of a constant of motion for the Schr¨odinger equation given by Eq. (5) that
emerges in the large-l limit, but it has not been identiﬁed in the present work.

≥

4. Conclusions

A simple algebraic method has been presented to generate an inﬁnite number of
parameters a for which closed-form solutions may be found to the Schr¨odinger equation
(4). The procedure
for the class of smoothed Coulomb potentials described by Eq.
bears some superﬁcial resemblances to the Sturmian approach. However,
it is not
based on a system of orthogonal polynomials, and because the functions it generates
are obviously incomplete, it probably cannot be simply related to known orthogonal
systems. These results should be useful for testing, to arbitrary numerical accuracy,
methods that integrate the Schr¨odinger equation for Coulomb-like systems, such as are
encountered in electronic structure and collision problems. The approach also points to
the possibility of previously unknown integrals of motion in these systems.

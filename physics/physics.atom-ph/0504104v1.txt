Abstract

A general expression for the double diﬀerential cross section of ﬂuorescence radiation fol-

lowing photorecombination (PRF) of polarized electrons and polarized ions is derived by using

usual atomic theory methods and is represented in the form of multiple expansions over spherical

tensors. The ways of the application of the general expression suitable for the speciﬁc experi-

mental conditions are outlined by deriving the asymmetry parameter of angular distribution of

PRF radiation in the case of nonpolarized ions and electrons. This parameter is calculated for

neon-like ions and bare nuclei. A very strong dependence of the asymmetry parameter of PRF

radiation angular distribution on free electron energy is obtained.

1. Introduction

Radiative recombination (RR) is one of the dominant processes leading to the decrease of

ionization degree of highly charged ions in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. In tokamak [1]

and ion storage rings [2] the self alignment of recombined ions arises due to the directed move-

ment of ions that determines a strong polarization and asymmetry of the angular distribution

of ﬂuorescence radiation. The capture of an electron by an ion can take place in two ways, i.e.

photorecombination (PR) and dielectronic recombination (DR). In PR, an ion A with charge

n+ captures a free electron, and the excess of the energy is emitted as PR radiation (PRR):

k01 denote the polarization and wave vector of PRR, respectively, αiJiMi show other quantum

numbers, total angular momentum and its projection of the ion i.

If a free electron is captured into a singly excited bound state, the recombined ion can decay

by emitting ﬂuorescence radiation (PRF)

A(n−1)+(α2J2M2)

A(n−1)+(α3J3M3) + hν(ˆǫ2k02).

DR is possible when the ion has one or more bound electrons. Then a free electron is

captured into an ion with simultaneous excitation of a bound electron. The resulting doubly

excited state of an ion can decay both radiatively and via autoionization. The DR occurs when

the radiation (DRR) is emitted. The experimental investigation of PR and PRF peculiarities is

possible because of ﬂuorescence radiation emitted in the region of wavelengths much longer in

comparison with those of DRR.

The aim of the present work is the derivation of a general expression for the diﬀerential cross

section of PRF following PR of polarized ions and polarized electrons by using atomic theory

methods [3-6] that are alternative to the density matrix formalism [7].

2. Derivation of general expression

The double diﬀerential cross section for PRF (2) following PR (1) process in two-step ap-

proximation can be written in the form of multipole expansion over non-observed states of the

intermediate ion [6]:

Here dσ/dΩ represents PR diﬀerential cross section that is inverse to that of photoionization.

Its expression can be written by using the Milne [8] relation and its multipole expansion is [4, 6]:

In nonrelativistic approximation, the expression (3) represents the most general case of the

double diﬀerential cross section for the PRF process of polarized ions and polarized electrons. In

two-step approximation, it enables us to obtain information about the polarization, asymmetry

of the angular distributions of PRR and PRF as well as angular correlations between PRR and

PRF. The parameters describing the polarization of the intermediate and ﬁnal ions can also be

derived.

3. Special cases

The cases of PRF following PR of nonpolarized and polarized or aligned ions with nonpolar-

ized electrons are of importance for tokamak plasmas. To obtain the expression for diﬀerential

cross section describing the angular distribution of PRF radiation when the PRR and ﬁnal

states of recombined ion and polarization of PRF radiation are not registered, one needs to

perform the summation in (3) over M3, polarization of radiation, q2 = q1 =
M T K

ˆJ ) = δ(K, 0)δ(N, 0). The integration gives
|

tion over the angles of PRR. The

dΩYKN (θ, φ) = δ(K, 0)δ(N, 0). The zero ranks of the corresponding multipole expansion ten-

R
sors should be inserted into (4) and (6) that leads to the simpliﬁcation of (3). For the randomly

P

oriented both ions and electrons, the expression (3) should be averaged with respect to the states

of the ion and electron.

written as follows:

Thus, in the of PR of nonpolarized ions and electrons and the choice of the laboratory z axis

along the direction of electrons, the expression for the diﬀerential cross section of PRF can be

λ, λ′ in

4. Calculations

The asymmetry parameters β2 (13) of the angular distribution for PRF in the case of PR

of bare nuclei and nonpolarized Ne-like ions Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, Ar8+, Fe16+, and Zn20+ with

nonpolarized electrons were calculated. The reduced matrix elements in

ph(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1)

B

(7) were calculated by using a computer program for the photoionization of atoms [9]. For the

calculation of (13) – (15), a computer program was created in the present work.

5

In the calculations, the energies of a free electron are chosen from 0 up to 450 eV that allows

the use of dipole approximation for PRR. The energy of PRR does not exceed 1.5 keV for Al18+

and Zn20+, therefore, it can be expected that the contribution of higher multipoles does not

exceed 2% for PR cross sections.

In the case of bare nuclei of He, F, and Ar atoms, calculated asymmetry parameters β2 of
the angular distribution of PRF for the transition 2p 2P3/2 →
1s 2S1/2 are shown in Fig. 1.
The relativistic calculations for Xe54+ [10] are also presented for comparison. The values of β2

are very similar near zero energies of free electron and decrease down from 0.34 with increasing

electron energy. For higher free electron energies, the values of β2 increase if the nuclear charge

increases.

For PRF of Ne-like ions via transition 2p6 1S0 →

2p63p 2P3/2 →

2p63s 2S1/2, the values

of calculated asymmetry parameters β2 are presented in Fig. 2. A very strong variation of β2

on free electron energy can be noticed for ions of low ionization degree, i.e. Na+ and Mg2+

which gradually disappears with increasing nuclear charge. The minimum noticed for Na+ and

Mg2+ coincides with the Cooper minimum in photoionization of Na and Mg+ that is reversed

to PR. The strong dependence of β2 on free electron energy is deﬁned by the alignment A2 (15)

of the recombined ion. The strong variations of A2 on free electron energy occurs due to the
interference of λ, λ′ in

ph(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1).

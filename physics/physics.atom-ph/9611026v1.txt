We show that the degeneracy parameter of a trapped Bose gas can be changed adiabatically
in a reversible way, both in the Boltzmann regime and in the degenerate Bose regime. We have
performed measurements on spin-polarized atomic hydrogen in the Boltzmann regime demonstrating
reversible changes of the degeneracy parameter (phase-space density) by more than a factor of two.
This result is in perfect agreement with theory. By extending our theoretical analysis to the quantum
degenerate regime we predict that, starting close enough to the Bose-Einstein phase transition, one
can cross the transition by an adiabatic change of the trap shape.

The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
in magnetically trapped atomic vapors of rubidium [1],
sodium [2], and lithium [3] has opened a new ﬁeld of
study at the intersection of atomic and condensed matter
physics. Presently, condensates are produced routinely
and detailed studies of condensate properties, such as
collective excitations [4] and interaction of two conden-
sates [5], are being made. The BEC phase transition
itself is especially intriguing. Open questions include the
kinetics of condensate formation and the eﬀect of inter-
atomic interactions and ﬁnite number of particles. Thus
far, measurements have relied upon evaporative cooling
to prepare the sample at the desired density below the
critical temperature. Evaporative cooling, however, is
inherently irreversible since it is based on the loss of
hot particles from the trap [6,7]. To tackle the above
questions it would be extremely valuable to vary the de-
generacy of the trapped gas adiabatically in a reversible
manner, with a ﬁxed number of particles, especially since
non-destructive detection methods have become available
[8].

The possibility of increasing phase-space density and
reaching BEC by changing the trapping potential was
investigated by Ketterle and Pritchard [9]. For a colli-
sionless gas they showed that it is impossible to inﬂuence
phase-space density by manipulating the trapping poten-
tial. An example is cooling by adiabatic expansion in a
harmonic trap: one does not lose any atoms, but one
does not get closer to BEC either.

In this paper we show that this “no pain, no gain”
principle is not true for a collisional gas. We experi-
mentally demonstrate that the degeneracy parameter of
a trapped gas can be changed adiabatically (without ex-
change of heat) and reversibly, without sacriﬁcing atoms,
by changing the shape of the trap slowly compared to the

internal equilibration time. Our experiments are done in
the Boltzmann regime where the degeneracy parameter
nΛ3 coincides with phase-space density. Here n denotes
the density of the gas at the minimum of the potential
and Λ ≡ (2π¯h2/mT )1/2 is the thermal de Broglie wave-
length at temperature T (with m the atomic mass and
Boltzmann’s constant kB = 1). We observed a change of
nΛ3 by a factor of two, which agrees well with a quantita-
tive prediction based on statistical thermodynamics ap-
plied to a trapped gas. We point out that, given suitable
starting conditions, this approach is also suited to cross
the BEC phaseline. This follows from analytical expres-
sions for heat capacity, entropy and condensate fraction
of a Bose gas as a function of the trap shape.

Our experiment is performed with atomic hydrogen in
the cryogenic Ioﬀe trap described by Van Roijen et al [10].
To determine quantities like temperature and density we
measure the Lyman-α absorption spectrum of the gas
and ﬁt calculated spectra to the experimental one (see
[11] for details). It takes a measuring time of 40 seconds
to reach a 10% level of accuracy under present condi-
tions. To minimize heating by photon recoil, we used our
Lyman-α source at low intensity (typically 106 photons
at the sample per pulse, 20 pulses per second). In order
to assure suﬃcient signal to noise ratio, we replaced the
photodiode used in previous experiments [11] by a pho-
tomultiplier. This method oﬀers a non-destructive way
to follow the evolution of a trapped gas in situ under
changing conditions.

The character of the Ioﬀe trap can be controlled via
the magnetic ﬁeld at the trap center, B0. For µBB0 ≫ T
(with µB the Bohr magneton), the trap is essentially har-
monic. For µBB0 ≪ T , the trap is close to linear in the
radial direction and nearly harmonic axially. We selected
two magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations, A and B, shown in
Fig. 1, that maximize the change in phase-space density
within the constraints of our apparatus.

After loading the trap from a cryogenic dissociator the
sample is evaporatively cooled by ramping down the mag-
netic barrier at one of the longitudinal ends of the trap
(at z = 5 cm, see Fig. 1). Evaporation is then stopped
by raising this barrier. Hereafter we let the sample decay
and equilibrate for about 1000 s to prepare a thermal
sample that is better than 95% doubly spin polarized
with typical densities around 1011 atoms/cm3 [10]. This
density was selected to assure negligible sample loss dur-
ing measurement of the spectrum. We gradually change
from trap A to trap B or vice versa in 60 s which is
much slower than the average elastic collision time of 5 s
at this density. After each change of trap a spectrum
is measured to determine the number of atoms and the
degeneracy parameter.

Changing the trap conﬁguration from A to B, the
temperature increased reversibly from TA ≈ 46mK to
TB ≈ 60mK. Both TA and TB showed an upward drift
of ∼ 10mK to the ﬁnal values mentioned above reached

2

after 5000 s.
In Fig. 2 we plot the degeneracy param-
eter nΛ3 versus time for a sample cycled between trap
A and trap B. It can be seen that the phase-space den-
sity diﬀers by a constant factor 2.05 ± 0.13 between trap
A and trap B. The number of trapped atoms N versus
time is plotted in the lower graph of Fig. 2. Although
T and n diﬀer considerably between the two traps, the
measured value for N is seen to be conserved within
experimental error. The slow decay of N was found
to be described by N (t) = N (0)/[1 + N (0)Gt] as one
would expect for a second-order decay process. The rate
G = (1.34 ± 0.05) × 10−14 per atom per second is consis-
tent with dipolar relaxation [10,12].

Our results can be understood within a dilute gas
model for N atoms at temperature T trapped in a deep
external potential, so that evaporation is negligible. Col-
lisions keep the gas in internal thermal equilibrium. The
number of particles in the gas is suﬃcient to enable a
thermodynamic description. Since we change the trap
potential slowly compared to the thermalization time,
thermodynamic processes proceed reversibly. Since there
is no exchange of heat or particles with the environment,
the thermodynamic entropy S of the gas is constant.
In our experiment, the inﬂuence of quantum statistics
is small and interactions between atoms do not inﬂu-
ence thermodynamics as the mean-ﬁeld interaction en-
ergy is much smaller than T . The degeneracy parameter
can be expressed in terms of the single-particle parti-
tion function Z1 and the total number of particles N as
nΛ3 = N/Z1 [6].

The internal energy E can be calculated from the par-

tition function to give [7]

E =

where γ = (T /Ve)∂Ve/∂T , with Ve ≡ N/n = Z1Λ3 the
eﬀective volume. Here γT is the average potential energy
per particle. For many trapping potentials γ is a constant
independent of T and Ve scales like T γ. For example,
for a box γ = 0, for a harmonic trap γ = 3/2, and for a
spherical quadrupole trap γ = 3. The canonical partition
function Z N
1 /N ! can be written as the exponential of the
Helmholtz free energy E − T S (see, e.g., [13]) to arrive at
the following expression for the degeneracy parameter:

nΛ3 = exp

.

Since in an adiabatic process S and N are constant, the
phase-space density does not change unless γ changes.
It immediately follows that many of the most obvious
ways of changing the trapping potential, like isotropic or
anisotropic scaling of a harmonic trap, do not inﬂuence
phase-space density. If we change γ adiabatically (e.g.,
experimentally, by changing B0 in a Ioﬀe trap), nΛ3 will
change as eγ.
In an extreme case, by slowly changing

3

the trap shape from square well to spherical quadrupole
the phase-space density in the center of the trap can be
increased by as much as a factor e3 ≈ 20.

For the two traps used in our experiment the value
of γ is weakly temperature dependent. For the measured
temperatures we ﬁnd γA ≈ 1.79 for trap A and γB ≈ 2.53
for trap B, the diﬀerence ∆γ = γB − γA after changing
trap shape always being 0.74±0.01. This implies a change
in phase-space density by a factor exp[∆γ] = 2.10 ± 0.02
in perfect agreement with the measured value of 2.05 ±
0.13.

We emphasize that it should be possible to achieve
considerable changes in the degeneracy parameter also
around the BEC transition. For this purpose we extend
our theoretical consideration to the case of a noninter-
acting Bose gas in the degenerate regime. This is a good
approximation also for a weakly interacting Bose gas as
long as the gas parameter na3 ≪ 1, where a is the scat-
tering length. Below the critical temperature we have the
additional condition that n0 ˜U ≪ T , with ˜U = 4π¯h2a/m
the scattering strength and n0 is the condensate density.
Expressions obtained for the entropy of an ideal Bose gas
are still good approximations around and above the criti-
cal temperature of a non-ideal Bose gas. Interactions will
change the shape of the condensate, but its entropy will
always be zero. Because the inﬂuence of the interactions
on the entropy of the above-condensate particles is negli-
gible in the binary collision regime the interactions only
become important when the condensate fraction becomes
so large that the mean ﬁeld energy of the condensate
changes the eﬀective potential for the above-condensate
particles. Gases used in current investigations, such as
Rb, Li, Na and H are suﬃciently close to this ideal gas
limit that thermodynamics are essentially unaﬀected by
interactions, unless the condensate fraction becomes ap-
preciable.

In the degenerate regime we continue to assume qua-
siclassical motion of the atoms. For clarity we restrict
ourselves to the case of a power-law potential, although
our expressions can easily be generalized to include the
Ioﬀe trap. A power-law trap is characterized by a density
of states of the type ρ(ǫ) = Aǫ1/2+δ (See [14] and [15] for
details). The scaling parameter A determines the size of
2 (¯hω)−3, where
the trap. E.g. for a harmonic trap A = 1
ω is the trap frequency. The parameter δ governs the
shape of the trap.
It can be shown that in the Boltz-
mann regime γ = δ independent of T for all power-law
traps.

The internal energy of a Bose gas in a power-law trap
above and below the critical temperature Tc [16] is given

reduces to the fugacity z. The speciﬁc heat at constant
particle number and constant trap potential can now be

respectively. In Eq. (5a) the second term gives rise to a
discontinuity in the heat capacity at Tc as already found
by Bagnato et al. [15], which appears only for δ > 1/2
because for δ < 1/2 the function g1/2+δ diverges, and
hence f3/2+δ tends to zero, as T → Tc. This jump in the
heat capacity was recently observed by the JILA group
[18]. The entropy S obeys dS/dT = C/T , and hence has
a kink at Tc for δ > 1/2. We ﬁnd that

For the homogeneous case (δ = 0) these expressions can
be found in standard statistical mechanics textbooks (e.g.
[17]). The entropy as a function of T /Tc is plotted in Fig.
3.

It is noteworthy that the ideal Bose gas in a power-
law trap in three space dimensions is isomorphic to the
uniform Bose gas in 2δ + 3 dimensions. There is no heat
capacity jump when the eﬀective dimension is less than
four. Remarkably, the processes which change the de-
generacy parameter are just those which correspond to
adiabatic changes of dimensionality!

If one moves along an isentropic line in Fig. 3 by in-
creasing δ, one can take a dilute gas close to BEC through
the transition. For example, by varying δ from 0 to 3 it

is possible to Bose condense a gas that had initially a
temperature 12 times higher than the critical temper-
(6) allow one
ature for that trap and given N . Eqs.
to calculate the fraction of condensate particles N0/N .
Starting with a Bose gas in an ideal harmonic potential
at T = Tc, and reversibly changing the trapping potential
to an ideal spherical-quadrupole, we would arrive below
Tc with a condensate fraction of 0.33. For the Ioﬀe trap,
starting at T = Tc at the limit of high B0, we expect
a condensate fraction of 0.25 in the trap at the limit of
low B0. Of course in these case T /Tc may already be so
low that the inﬂuence of interactions can no longer be
neglected.

Our method allows one to control the degeneracy of
a Bose gas and gently pull it across Tc and back. Cy-
cling times are only limited by the elastic collision rate
which for the alkali atoms has been demonstrated to be
much faster than for hydrogen. Combined with non de-
structive diagnostics [8] this yields the unique possibility
to study both condensate formation and destruction and
to establish the presence or absence of asymmetries and
hysteresis.

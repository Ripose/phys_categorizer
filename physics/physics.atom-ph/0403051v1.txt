Abstract: I show that the theory developed for quantum delocalization of an excited Hydrogen
atom in a two-frequency linearly polarized microwave ﬁeld [1] can be used with a few adaptions
to explain the quantum delocalization of Alkali atoms in a linearly polarized monochromatic ﬁeld
in the regime where it deviates from Hydrogenic behaviour. Comparison with numerical [2–4]
and laboratory [5] experiments is satisfactory: apart from a constant factor, independent from the
microwave frequency, the same dependence from the initial quantum number is observed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent numerical studies [2–4] have shown that the ionization threshold of Rydberg Alkali atoms in a linearly
polarized monochromatic microwave ﬁeld with frequency ω agrees well with that of Hydogen atoms for high initial
quantum number n0 (n0 ≥ ω−1/3) but strongly deviates from it for low n0.

This deviation is attributed to the reduced spacing of levels due to the breaking of the angular momentum degeneracy
by the core electrons: intuitively, the presence of low angular momentum levels in between the rungs of the high angular
momentum Hydrogen-like ladder allows the electron an eﬃcient ionization path even when the ﬁeld frequency is lower
than the nearest level transition frequency of Hydrogen.

No evaluation of the threshold in this regime has yet been given. Direct application of the Hydrogen quantum
delocalization formula from Ref. [6] requires the assumption that the details of the underlying classical dynamics are
not important as long as it is globally chaotic. This is not the case: when n0 becomes lower than the value at which the
Hydrogen classical chaos theshold crosses the quantum delocalization threshold (n0 ∼= ω−1/3), the Alkali simulations
[3] show an abrupt change in the n0-dependence of the ionization ﬁeld intensity threshold from the Hydrogen-like
inverse one to a ﬂat one. I propose an evaluation in terms of a local correspondence between the biggest phase space
structures of an Alkali atom in a linearly polarized monochromatic microwave ﬁeld and those of a monodimensional
Hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized bichromatic microwave ﬁeld. In agreement with Ref. [3] the threshold thus
obtained does not depend on n0.

This application of the theory of quantum delocalization of an excited Hydrogen atom in a two-frequency microwave
ﬁeld [1] also provides indirect experimental validation for it: there have been experimental works with bichromatic
microwave ﬁelds [7], but they were out of the range of validity of the theory so that it has never been tested in practice.

The motion of the perturbed system being restricted to a plane, I consider a two dimensional Alkali atom model

[8] in the {x, z} = {r, θ} plane:

where the last term descibes the nonhydrogenic core potential [9]. I then make a canonical transformation to the
action angle variables {I, J, λ, µ} thus obtaining the Hamiltonian:

where I is the total action, J is the angular momentum, and the “quantum defect” δ(J) is a monotonic decreasing
function going to zero for J → I; extended numerical tests have shown no discernible dependance of δ from I. The
frequencies associated to the two actions are therefore:

To describe the atom-ﬁeld interaction I now introduce the usual dipole approximation term H1 = F z cos ωt =

F r cos θ cos ωt, where F is the electric ﬁeld amplitude and ω its frequency, and I Fourier expand it in λ and µ:

ωI =

H1 = F Σn,mVn,m(I, J) cos(nλ + mµ − ωt);

where the sum extends to both positive and negative values of the indices n and m, and the coeﬃcients Vn,m(I, J)
are the semiclassical matrix elements for transitions with ∆I = n and ∆J = m.

In extended phase space {I, J, K, λ, µ, ψ}, with K the “photon number”, the Hamiltonian therefore is:

H (Al) = −

2(I − δ(J))2 + ωK + F Σn,mVn,m(I, J) cos(nλ + mµ − ψ).

III. CORRESPONDENCE

The extended phase space Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in a two-frequency microwave ﬁeld with frequencies

ω1 and ω2 and ﬁeld amplitudes F1 and F2 reads [10]:

H (2f ) = −

1
2I 2 + ¯ωK + ∆J + ΣnVn(I)[F2 cos(nλ + µ − ψ) + F1 cos(nλ − µ − ψ)],

where ¯ω = (ω1 + ω2)/2 and ∆ = (ω1 − ω2)/2 [11].

There are some similarities between eq. (6) and eq. (5); my aim is to ﬁnd a suitable choice of the four parameters
F1, F2, ω1, and ω2 so that the local phase space structure relevant to ionization is similar for the two Hamiltonians. A
global correspondence is not possible as the two Hamiltonians are clearly non-equivalent: the functional dependence
on I and J of the noninteracting part of the Hamiltonians is diﬀerent in the two cases. Moreover, the atom-ﬁeld
interaction term in eq. (5) has more terms than the one in eq. (6) which only has the m = ±1 ones; but, since these
are those corresponding to the most important resonances (the dipole ones) in eq. (5), this is not a big problem.

From the amplitudes of the interaction terms we immediately have:

Vn,−1(I, J)
Vn′ (I ′)
where, for the moment we leave undetermined whether I equals I ′ and n equals n′.

Vn,+1(I, J)
Vn′ (I ′)

F1 = F

F2 = F

,

More problematic is dealing with the atomic part for the determination of the frequencies: the (n, ±1) resonance

condition reads

for eq. (6). In eq. (8) ω is given and J0 is ﬁxed by our initial conditions; eq. (8) therefore ﬁxes I0 for any given
resonance index n. Around the resonance we now expand the atomic energy term in eq. (5) to the second order in
x = I − I0 and to the ﬁrst order in y = J − J0 and we compare the resulting expression

(the constant terms have been dropped). The linear terms cancel because of the resonance conditions eqs. (8) and
(9); the equality of the two x2 terms instead requires

I0 − δ(J0) = I ′

0

and eq. (9) thus gives us the combination ¯ω ± ∆, once n′ has been chosen. We can therefore choose ¯ω and ∆ so that
the local Hamiltonians are equivalent at two separate resonances. If we choose J0 to be the same for both resonances,
the distance in I0 and in I ′
0 will be the same because of (12) and the two resonances will overlap at the same ﬁeld
amplitude in the two systems.

Since we are considering ionization at low frequencies, we choose to have equivalence at the two lowest resonances:
= l + γ with γ ∈ (0, 1); the two lowest Alkali resonances will be those with n = l + 1 (for m = −1)

let us write
and n = −l (for m = +1); for the hydrogen atom it will instead be n′ = 1. We therefore have from eq. (8):

An intuitive quantum interpretation of the last two formulas is that we equate the Rabi frequencies at each of the
two resonances; the ﬁrst two equations can instead be seen as equating the ratios of the single microwave frequency
of the Alkali system to its two atomic transition frequencies with the ratios of the two microwave frequencies of the
Hydrogen system to its atomic transition frequency.

IV. QUANTUM DELOCALIZATION BORDER

According to Ref. [1] the threshold for quantum delocalization of a (1D) Hydrogen atom in a microwave ﬁeld sum
of two sine waves with incommensurable frequencies ω1 and ω2 and amplitudes F1 and F2 is given by the equation

1 ≥

(ω1ω2)5/6
1.8(F1F2)1/2 .

Substituting the values obtained above, and introducing the scaled quantities F0 = F n4
is the quantum number of the initially populated state, this becomes

0, and ω0 = ωn3

0, where n0 = I0

The 1D hydrogenic matrix element reads 0.325(I (±)

0 −δ(J0))2 [10]; to instead evaluate the alkali matrix elements, we
apply the semiclassical theory developed in Refs. [12,13]: it allows us to speedily calculate good approximations of
the full quantum matrix elements that would otherwise require lengthy calculations [14]. The formula derived in Refs.
[12,13] for the matrix element between two states with eﬀective quantum numbers (ν = n − δ, l) and (ν′ = n′ − δ′, l′)
reads:

where the average quantum number νc is again I (±)
0 − δ(J0). For high principal quantum numbers and low angular
momenta we can approximate the eccentricity with ε ≈ 1 and Φ with g0(γ) tabulated in Ref. [13] so that the
delocalization condition reads:

The last factor on the right side of eq. (18) is given in table (1) for the s → p transition of the four alkali; its
maximum variation is 10%. Eq. (18) is therefore essentially independent from γ, that is from the element considered,
in accordance with the numerical results from Ref. [2].

Substituting the approximate value 1 for this factor, eq. (18) ﬁnally becomes

The range of validity is max(γ, 1 − γ) < ω0 < 1, that agrees well with the region II of Ref. [2,3].

Removing the esplicit dependence from n0 and introducing the value ω = 2π · 36 GHz = 5.47 · 10−6 a.u. we can

cast eq. (19) in the form :

which allows direct comparison with the numerical results in Ref. [2,3]. Scaling instead to ¯ω0 = 3.4ω0 and using the
value ω = 2π · 8.867 GHz = 1.35 · 10−6 a.u. we can compare our result

to the experimental ones given in Ref. [5].

V. CONCLUSIONS

Both the laboratory [5] and numerical [2,3] results are higher than our evaluation by a factor 3.7 which is bigger
than the factor 2 we expect from the analogous evaluation for the Hydrogen atom in a monochromatic microwave
ﬁeld; on the other hand it is signiﬁcant that -for both diﬀerent microwave frequencies and diﬀerent initial principal
quantum numbers- the deviation factor is always the same. In particular, the absence of a dependence of F from n0
which is evident for regime II in the numerical results shown in Fig. 5a of Ref. [3] is in agreement with eq. (19), which
can be written in unscaled form as F ≥ ω5/3/1.8; while it is in clear disagreement with the Hydrogen delocalization
border n

−1
0 dependence [6].

In the experimental F0 Vs. ω0 plot [5] the ionization threshold values for high ω0 appear to be somehow lower than
our evaluation corrected by the factor 3.7; this is most likely due to the deﬁnition of ”ionization” in the experiment as
excitation above a given quantum number nb: increasing ω0 by the increase of n0 brings the initial conditions closer
to this border thus lowering the theshold [16].

noise in the experiment.

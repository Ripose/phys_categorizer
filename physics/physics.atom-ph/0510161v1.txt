We examine the quantum dynamics of cold atoms subjected to pairs of closely spaced δ-kicks
from standing waves of light, and ﬁnd behaviour quite unlike the well-studied quantum kicked rotor
(QKR). Recent experiments [Jones et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 223002 (2004)] identiﬁed a regime
of chaotic, anomalous classical diﬀusion. We show that the corresponding quantum phase-space has
a cellular structure, arising from a unitary matrix with oscillating band-width. The corresponding
eigenstates are exponentially localized, but scale with a fractional power, L ∼ ~−0.75, in contrast
to the QKR for which L ∼ ~−1. The eﬀect of inter-cell (and intra-cell) transport is investigated by
studying the spectral ﬂuctuations with both periodic as well as ‘open’ boundary conditions.

INTRODUCTION

A recent experimental study [1] of cesium atoms sub-
jected to pairs of near δ-kicks using pulsed optical po-
tentials showed behaviour surprisingly diﬀerent from the
well-studied single-kick system, the quantum kicked rotor
(QKR or δ-KR). The QKR is possibly the most stud-
ied experimental and theoretical paradigm of classical
Hamiltonian chaos. The classical dynamics of the sys-
tem make a gradual transition to chaotic dynamics as a
function of an eﬀective kick strength K (related to the
intensity of the optical potential). It has also been well-
investigated experimentally, using mainly cesium atoms
In the large K (chaotic) regime, typical classical
[2].
trajectories are diﬀusive; to lowest order, the diﬀusion
is a random walk in momentum, with diﬀusion constant
D ≈ K 2
2 . Then, for a corresponding ensemble of atoms,
say, the average kinetic energy increases linearly with
time i.e. hp2i/2 ∼ Dt. Short-ranged correlations to the
classical diﬀusion do exist, however, and their eﬀects have
also been observed experimentally [3].

In the corresponding quantum system, the quan-
tum kicked rotor (QKR), the diﬀusion is arrested on a
timescale t∗ ∼ D/~2. In experiments and calculations,
an initially gaussian momentum distribution N (p, t = 0),
is seen to evolve into an exponentially localized distribu-
tion N (p, t > t∗) ∼ exp −|p|/L, where L ∼ D
~ . This
quantum suppression of chaotic diﬀusion is an important
quantum chaos phenomenon termed Dynamical Localiza-
tion [4]. A formal connection between Dynamical Local-
ization and Anderson localization, (the exponential local-
ization of electronic wavefunctions in disordered metals)
has been made [5].

Here we consider instead the case where the particles
are subjected instead to pairs of closely spaced kicks:
the 2δ-kicked rotor (2δ-KR). The recent experimental
study [1] showed that the corresponding classical dif-
fusion is anomalous, and involves many additional cor-
rections from weak, but long-ranged (in time) corre-
lations. The experiment identiﬁed periodically spaced

momentum-trapping regions where the atoms absorb lit-
tle energy, interspersed by regions where they absorb en-
ergy even more rapidly than the standard δ-KR system.

FIG. 1: Experimental results from [1] showing eﬀects of mo-
mentum trapping. Each point indicates the energy absorbed
by a cloud of cesium atoms after dynamical localization. The
horizontal-axis gives the initial average momenta hpi = P0 of
each cloud of cesium atoms:
i.e. each atomic cloud initially
has a gaussian momentum distribution well-centred on P0.
The trapping regions correspond to hp2i ≃ 0. All the data
corresponds to eﬀective values of K = 3.2 and ~ = 1.

In this work we extend and develop a preliminary study
of this system [6], and reveal unusual localization prop-
erties and spectral ﬂuctuations not seen in the standard
QKR. We ﬁnd a novel dynamical localization regime,
with generic localization lengths L ∝ ~−0.75 determined
by a fractional exponent (≃ 0.75). A similar exponent
was found in P (t) = |hψ(t = 0)|ψ(t)i|2 ∼ t−0.75, the re-
turn probabilities. To our knowledge, there is no similar
study of a KAM system so globally characterized by a
single fractional exponent. A mixed phase-space regime
(with a mixture of a chaotic regions and stable islands)
can indeed exhibit fractional return probabilities [7], but
it will typically have many competing exponents, charac-
terizing only local regions of phase space. The quantum

localization properties are thus not generic, and depend
sensitively on the detailed phase-space structure.

For the 2δ-KR, we present evidence indicating that the
localization properties are related to the scaling proper-
ties of phase space in the vicinity of golden-ratio can-
tori. We argue that the observed behaviour is due to
the presence of families of golden ratio cantori occupy-
ing an appreciable fraction of each cell. In addition, the
‘cellular’ momentum structure suggested by the exper-
iments is shown to correspond to a time-evolution op-
erator with a not previously investigated periodically-
oscillating banded structure. The corresponding eigen-
states can be well localized within a single cell deﬁned
by this oscillating band; or they may extend over several
cells.

We characterize the spectral behaviour by two param-
eters: a ﬁlling parameter, R, which quantiﬁes the frac-
tion of a cell that a typical state occupies, and d, which
quantiﬁes inter-cell transport. We consider two types
of distinct (but related) delocalization transitions: (a) a
0 → 1 cell transition as eigenstates ﬁll one cell (R ≃ 1
but d > 2) (b) a 1 → several cell transition, as states de-
localize from a single cell to many, occurring for R ≫ 1
and d ≤ 2.

As the 0 → 1 cell transition occurs, all states extend
into fractal cantori-ﬁlled regions bordering each cell; we
identify a regime with spectral properties (particularly
spectral variances which, while not identical, may be
compared with ‘critical statistics’. The latter were ﬁrst
studied near the critical point of the Anderson Metal-
Insulator transition (MIT) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. So-called
‘critical statistics’ are now of much current interest in
chaotic systems with classical discontinuities (non-KAM
systems) [14, 15, 16, 17]; they have been attributed to the
eﬀect of cantori [16, 17]; however they are not expected in
KAM system, due to their non-generic properties. Below,
we use the term critical statistics in this broader sense,
rather than speciﬁcally the critical point of the MIT.

Imposing periodic boundary conditions in momentum
space eﬀectively conﬁnes the system’s eigenstates to a
single cell (with toroidal geometry). Such a calculation
shows a transition from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson statis-
tics (they are of similar functional form to GOE results,
so are referred to as such below, although strictly they
are COE statistics), via a new regime of intermediate
statistics. We also calculate eigenstates for the open sys-
tem (non-periodic boundary conditions). This calcula-
tion yields agreement with the single-cell calculation up
to the onset of delocalization, but beyond shows rather
diﬀerent behaviour. For d ≃ 2 the spectral statistics
show a signature of the onset of delocalization of the
eigenstates into multiple cells, characterized by a return
towards Poissonian statistics.

In summary, our main new results are 1) A study of
the cellular form of the unitary operator of this system,
which diﬀers substantially with the behaviour of band
random matrices (BRM), which approximate the ordi-
nary QKR. 2) Numerical evidence for behaviour analo-

2

gous to critical statistics associated with cantori [17]. 3)
The spectral signatures of delocalization from one cell, to
several cells. 4) A novel regime of exponential localiza-
tion determined by the fractional exponent 0.75, which
coincides closely with the dominant scaling exponent ob-
tained in the vicinity of golden-ratio cantori. In Section
II, we review the present state of knowledge of the 2δ-KR.
In Section III we introduce the time-evolution operator
and obtain, for the ﬁrst time, an analytical form for its
bandwidth. In Section IV we investigate the dynamical
localization and the fractional exponent ν = 0.75.
In
Section V we look at the delocalization within a single
cell, by solving the problem ‘on a torus’ in momentum
space and compare with critical statistics. In Section VI
we compare the behaviour with a calculation with ‘open’
boundary conditions and the signature for the onset of
delocalization onto many cells. Finally in Section VII we
give our conclusions and discussion.

II. THE 2δ-KR

We consider a system with a Hamiltonian correspond-

ing to a sequence of closely spaced pairs of kicks:

H =

− K cos x

[δ(t − nT ) + δ(t − nT + ǫ)] ,

p2
2

Xn

where ǫ ≪ T is a short time interval and K is the kick-
strength. We now use a re-scaled time in units of T . The
classical map for the 2δ-KR is then a two-kick map:

pj+1 = pj + K sin xj
xj+1 = xj + pj+1ǫ
pj+2 = pj+1 + K sin xj+1
xj+2 = xj+1 + pj+2(1 − ǫ).

(2.1)

(2.2)

Clearly, the limit ǫ = 1 or 0 corresponds to the Stan-
dard Map, which describes the classical dynamics of the
QKR:

pi+1 = pi + K sin xi
xi+1 = xi + pi+1

An experimental realization of this system was ob-
tained in [1], with cold cesium atoms in pulsed stand-
ing waves of light. Atoms with momenta hpi = p0 ≃
(2m + 1)π/ǫ (relative to the optical lattice) are conﬁned
in momentum trapping regions and absorb little energy;
conversely, atoms prepared near p0ǫ = 2mπ experience
rapid energy growth up to localization. The experimental
trapping regions are shown in Fig.1. The basic mech-
anism of trapping is fairly intuitive: atoms for which
p0ǫ = (2m + 1)π and m = 0, 1, . . . experience an impulse
K sin x followed by another one ≃ K sin(x + π) which
in eﬀect cancels the ﬁrst. Over time, however, there is

a gradual de-phasing of this classical ‘anti-resonant’ pro-
cess. A theoretical study of the classical diﬀusion over
longer times than a couple of kicks in [1] found anomalous
momentum diﬀusion for all p0, with long-ranged correc-
tions to the D ≃ K 2/2 uncorrelated diﬀusion rate, not
present in the Standard Map.

The one-kick matrix for the QKR has a well-studied
band-structure: since Jl−m(x) ≃ 0 for |l − m| ≫ x, we
can deﬁne a bandwith for U (0), namely, b = K
~ (this is
strictly a half-bandwidth) which is independent of the
angular momenta l and m. However, this is not the case
for the matrix of U ǫ.

Below we present the corresponding quantum be-

K, ǫ and ~ independently.

where the phase Φ = ~

Hence we infer a momentum dependent bandwidth,
b(p) = 2K
~ cos pǫ/2. Fig.2 shows the calculated form of
both matrices (white denotes matrix elements less than a
small threshold). While U (0) has a constant bandwidth,
the bandwith for the matrix of U ǫ oscillates with l from
a maximum value bmax = 2K
~ , equivalent to twice the
bandwidth of U (0), down to a minimum value bmin ∼ 0.
In eﬀect, since bmin ∼ 0, U ǫ is partitioned into sub-
matrices of dimension N = 2π
ǫ~ corresponding precisely
to the momentum cells of width ∆p = N ~ observed in
the experiment.

For the QKR, the localization properties of the eigen-
states have been investigated extensively (see e.g.
[20]
for a review). The eigenstates are exponentially local-
ized, with momentum probability distributions N (p) ∼
exp −2|p|/L, where the localization length L ≈ K 2
4~ =
b2~/4, in the large K, small ~ limits.

For the 2δ-QKR,
in the limit of small bandwidth
2K
~ ≪ N we deﬁne a ‘local’ localization length for the
eigenstates:

L(p) = b2(p)~/4 =

K 2
~ cos2 pǫ/2

(3.5)

This corresponds quite well with the oscillations seen
in the experiment in Fig.1(a); the energy oscillates sinu-
soidally from a maximum value hp2i ≃ 400 ∼ 4L2 ≃ 4K 4
for K = 3.2, ~ = 1, (in re-scaled units) down to a mini-
mum value hp2i ≃ 0 for P0 ≃ π/ǫ. In contrast, Fig.1(b)
corresponds to a regime where the eigenstates are tending
to ﬁll each cell, i.e. L(p) → N ~.

In [18, 20] it was shown that the eigenstates of the
QKR can also be obtained using a U (0) matrix of ﬁnite
dimension N . The ratio of the localization length to N ,
was used to characterize the degree of ‘ﬁlling’ of the ma-
trix U (0) It was shown that for a ratio R ≪ 1 the be-
haviour is Poissonian. With increasing R, a transition to
GOE behaviour was observed

For the 2δ-QKR we can also introduce a ‘ﬁlling factor’

R deﬁned by the ratio [18]:

While for the 2δ-QKR we have a natural choice of N ,
determined by the position of physical boundaries (the

trapping regions), the value of N in the QKR case is
quite arbitrary. The problem is solved ‘on a torus’ in
momentum. The momentum periodicity of the matrix
is adjusted by a choice of a rational value of the kicking
period T ~ (see Sec. V below). We can then compare
matrices for both U (0) and U ǫ, with similar N and R.

The interesting aspect of the 2δ-QKR system is that,
as we show below, we can vary the coupling between the
cells independently (with some constraints on allowable
parameters) from the degree of ﬁlling of each individual
cell. We will show below, that there is a particularly
interesting regime where, for most eigenstates, L(p) ∼
N ~, but the states are still largely trapped within a single
cell. We can then ‘open’ the boundaries of the cells and
investigate the delocalization regime.

In order to investigate the transport between cells, we
examine the surprisingly diﬀerent (relative to the QKR)
process of dynamical localization in the 2δ-QKR.

There is a steep drop in probability at each step:

where N ±(p) denote the probability after and before the
step respectively. The localization length is

The parameter d controls the transport through the cell
boundaries. It also contains the ~ dependence of Lp. In
Fig.4, the dependence of d on Kǫ and hǫ = ~ǫ is shown.
It may be seen that to very good accuracy:

for both eigenstates and wavepackets), show a long-range
tail of ‘staircase’ form which on average follows the exponen-
tial N (p) ∼ exp −2(p − p)/Lp where Lp/2 = N ~/2d; since
N ~ = 2π/ǫ, the ~-dependence of Lp is determined by the
drop in probability, d, at each cell boundary.

to the well-known QKR result Lp ∝ ~−1. The dashed line
indicates R ≃ 1 the one-cell ﬁlling border (i.e. R > 1 below
the line). The delocalization border (d ≃ 2) is the dot-dash
line (i.e. d < 2 below the line and represents the onset of
signiﬁcant coupling between cells). Statistics are presented
later, in Fig.13, for points corresponding to the dotted line.

It is interesting to consider the origin of the ~−0.75 be-
haviour. In fact, the ﬁrst ∼ 1 − 2 steps of the staircase
can be seen in experiments with optical lattices of [1].

An earlier experiment [21] with pairs of broad pulses (as
opposed to pulses short enough in duration to approx-
imate δ-kicks) also showed a steep drop in probability
over a narrow momentum region. This was identiﬁed as
due to the presence of cantori. The ﬁnite pulse system
does not have the momentum periodicity (and hence the
generic character) of the 2δ- kicked system, and is eﬀec-
tively integrable at large p. Nevertheless, the classical
dynamics is similar to the 2δ-QKR for p ∼ 0. The QKR
shows analogous behaviour: for pulses of ﬁnite duration,
the classical dynamics is similar to the δ-kicked system
for p small.

We can examine the classical behaviour in the trap-
ping regions. Starting from the two-kick map Eq.2.1 and
expanding our initial momenta around the trapping mo-
menta pj ≃ Pn + δpj where Pn = (2n + 1)π/ǫ, we can
write

K sin

(cid:2)

xj + (2n + 1)π + δpjǫ + Kǫ sin xj

pj+2 = pj + K sin xj +
.

(4.6)

(cid:3)

We can expand the trigonometric expressions, making
small angle approximations if we assume δpjǫ ≪ 2π and
Kǫ ≪ 2π.
In the trapping regions we then obtain an
approximate one-kick map
pj+2 ≃ pj − K 2 ǫ
2
xj+2 ≃ xj + pj+2T

sin 2xj − Kδpj ǫ cos xj

(4.8)

(4.7)

The small angle assumption δpjǫ ≪ π constrains ∆p,

the eﬀective width of the trapping region,

∆p ∼ 1/ǫ.

(4.9)

A study of the Poincar´e surfaces of section (SOS) may
be found in [28]. But in summary, at the centre of the
trapping region, where δpj = 0, only the sin 2x kick in
Eq.4.7 is signiﬁcant so the classical SOS shows structure
very similar to a ‘period-doubled’ Standard Map with im-
pulse V ′(x) = Kef f sin 2x where Kef f ≃ K 2 ǫ
2 and Kef f
is an eﬀective kick strength. However, further out within
the trapping region, the SOS show that it is the cos x kick
in Eq.4.7 which is dominant and the island structure is
similar to that of a Standard Map with impulse:

V ′(x) ≃ Kδp ǫ cos x.

(4.10)

Given the importance of the Kǫ scaling seen in
Fig.4 (rather than a K 2ǫ scaling) we suggest that the
Kef f cos x form of Eq.4.7 determines the quantum be-
haviour. This implies that regions with:

Kδpj ǫ ≫ K 2 ǫ
2

(4.11)

dominate transport. This will be the case if δpj is large;
from Eq.4.9, we deduce that this implies the criterion
Kǫ ≪ 1. However, if Kǫ is too small, the phase space
will be too regular. Hence, values of Kǫ ≈ 0.1 − 0.3 seem
indicated.

In any case, the resonance structure in much of the
trapping regions is always locally similar to the Stan-
dard Map, but with a varying eﬀective kick strength (and
phase of the impulse). For the Standard Map the last in-
variant phase-space manifolds correspond to p/(2π) ≃ φ
or ≃ 1 − φ where φ is the Golden Ratio. The fractal rem-
nant of this last manifold plays a role in transport in the
Standard Map for K ≃ 1 − 3. Here, this would suggest
δpKǫ ≈ 1 − 3 and δp ∼ 10.

The scaling properties of the phase-space around the
golden ratio cantori were investigated by [24]. A char-
acteristic exponent σs ≈ 0.75 was found in directions
dominated by elliptic ﬁxed points. We term this the sta-
ble/dominant exponent. On the other hand σu ≈ .66 was
found in directions dominated by hyperbolic ﬁxed points.
We term this the unstable/sub-dominant exponent.

Previous studies of the QKR [23] found a L ∝ ~+σ
scaling, with σ ≃ σu ≃ 0.66, for momenta near the range
1 − φ < pT /2π < φ. In [25], a L ∝ ~+σu scaling was asso-
ciated to a tunneling type process (termed ‘retunneling’)
in [25]. An abrupt change to a regime with L ∝ ~−σ,
with σ ≈ 0.5, was also observed, and was attributed to
a localization process which dominates when transport
through the fractal cantoral regions is more ‘open’. In
that work, it was argued that the process has similarities
with dynamical localization.

The 2δ-KR results, with a negative sign on the expo-
nent L ∼ ~−0.75 correspond to a localization regime, and
are consistent with quantum probability ‘sticking’ mostly

to directions where there are (or were, at lower K) ellip-
tic ﬁxed points. One might speculate why no previous
studies uncovered a regime dominated by σs; we note
that in [23, 25] the L ∼ ~+0.66 scaling refers to a local
region; these are regimes where there are many stable
islands and overall diﬀusion in each phase-space mani-
fold is either absent, or rather slow. Here, in contrast,
part of phase-space is taken by very chaotic, fast diﬀus-
ing regions, with trajectories which roam freely over large
areas of phase-space; the only appreciable localization oc-
curs at the stabler parts of cantoral remnants. In many
regimes, there can be contributions from ∼ 1/ǫ groups of
golden-ratio cantori, rather than simply a single region
near p/2π ≃ φ like the Standard Map. We note that
Fig.13 in [25], where the σ = 0.5 scaling is obtained, is
in a diﬃcult numerical regime: barring one data point, a
value σ ≃ 0.75 is not implausible.

We also calculated return probabilities P (t) of the
quantum wavepackets with time, averaged over 100 ini-
tial starting conditions close to the centre of the trapping

where Pl(t) = |hψ(t)|ψl(t = 0)i|2. The initial condition
was taken to be an angular momentum eigenstate ψl(t =
0) = |li. The results were averaged from l1 = π/ǫ~ to
l2 = l1 + 100. Fig.5 shows plots of P (t), which show that
P (t) decays as t−0.75 up to the break-time. For the lowest
values of Kǫ, the t−0.75 decay is not apparent since the
wavepacket localizes almost immediately.

A well-known relation between power-law return prob-
abilities and the spectral statistics (variances) has been
investigated for ‘critical statistics’ in non-KAM billiards
or the Anderson transition [9, 11, 13, 17]. While the
present systems has important diﬀerences (it is a smooth
KAM system; it has a cellular structure and an oscillat-
ing band unitary matrix), the pre-eminence of the sin-
gle fractional exponent motivates an investigation of the
spectral properties.

We investigate the statistics as a function of the ﬁlling
factor R and the inter-cell transport parameter d. Calcu-
lations were done for two types of boundary conditions:
periodic boundary conditions and ‘open’ (non-periodic)
boundary conditions. These are discussed in turn below.

V. EIGENSTATES: PERIODIC BOUNDARY

We may keep the dimension of the unitary matrix U to
a ﬁnite value N by making the momentum periodic with
period N ~, following the approach in [18, 19, 20].

Here ~ = 2M π/N , where M is an integer (non commen-
surate with N ) which determines the momentum width
of the matrix, i.e. N ~ = 2M π; unlike the 2δ-KR, there
is no underlying physical cellular phase-space structure
to justify the choice of a particular M, N .

Note the dependence of the matrix elements on two
Bloch phases: θp is a Bloch phase in the p direction
while θx, the Bloch phase in the x direction, is the quasi-
momentum. If θp 6= 0, π, parity is not a good quantum
number and we may use all eigenvalues in the statistics,
regardless of parity. It is customary (e.g. [7, 17]) to cal-
culate spectra for several θp to improve signiﬁcance. In
practice, we found that for the 2δ − KR, even for sizable
K, there are very localized states which are too removed
from the boundaries and generate pairs of parity-related
pairs of near-degeneracies. The parity conservation eﬀect
is more eﬀectively eliminated by, in addition to θp 6= 0, π,
also having θx 6= 0, 0.5. The cantori eﬀects we investigate
are not aﬀected by a non-zero quasi-momentum, and thus
we average over several quasi-momenta.

FIG. 8: Typical number variances Σ2(L) as a function of
R for the 2δ − KR. We use the best ﬁt to the slope to
estimate the level compressibility χ. For R small, we have
Poissonian statistics and Σ2(L) ≃ χL ≃ L. For suﬃciently
large L, Σ2(L) ∼ Ln(L) is far from linear; in this case the
value χ < 0.05 is simply an indication that Σ2(L) is close to
the GOE limit. We identify an intermediate regime where
Σ2(L) ∼ χL for 1 ≪ L ≪ N ,(here N = 2513) with χ ∼ 0.13,
corresponding to a similar range of R as the regime seen in
Fig.7.

A. Eﬀects of cantori in 0 → 1 cell transition: QKR
versus 2δ − KR

We have calculated eigenvalues of the unitary matrix
for a range of values of M , N and K. Below we compare
nearest neighbour (P (S)) distributions and spectral vari-
ances Σ2(L) = hL2i − hLi2, of the 2δ − KR with those of
the QKR as a function of the ﬁlling factor R = K 2/N ~2.
We present results for M = 25 (i.e. ǫ = 0.04) and values
close to N = 625, 1250 and 2500 (one cannot have N, M
commensurate).

In Fig.6 we show typical NNS distributions for R ≪ 1,
R ∼ 1 and R ≫ 1. For both single/double-kicked sys-
tems, the behaviour evolves from Poissonian to GOE,
via an intermediate distribution at R ∼ 1. While the
2δ − KR does not exactly show the intermediate Semi-
Poisson form, it can get quite close, and so a comparison
is helpful. Here we quantify the deviation of P (S) from
PP (S) and PGOE(S), its Poisson and GOE limits respec-
tively, with a quantity Q [26]:

1 − Q =

S0

0 (P (S′) − PGOE(S′)dS′)
R
S0
0 (PP (S′) − PGOE(S′))dS′
R

.

(5.6)

Hence Q = 0 indicates a Poisson distribution, while
Q = 1 signals a GOE distribution. We take S0 = 0.3.
In Fig.7 we plot Q as a function of R. We ﬁnd that
while the QKR moves rapidly from Poisson to GOE for
R ∼ 1, the 2δ − KR curve abruptly changes slope and
the distribution evolves much more slowly towards GOE.
We identify this as the regime where delocalization of the
eigenstates over the whole cell is constrained by the can-
tori regions bordering the cells. A ﬁt to alternative func-
tions, such as the Berry-Robnik [27], gives a qualitatively
similar picture.

In Fig.8, we show that the variances are close to Pois-
sonian Σ2(L) ≃ L for small R, and are close to GOE

compares the transition from Poissonian (χ = 1) to GOE
(χ < 0.05) for the QKR with those of the 2δ − KR as a
function of the ﬁlling factor R = K 2/N ~2. Parameters are
similar to Fig7. The QKR makes a rapid transition to GOE
at R ≃ 1 (with the exception of the small minimum seen at
R ≃ 1 and N = 2500 which corresponds to a classical anti-
resonance K ≃ π). The 2δ − KR on the other hand shows
an approximate plateau near χ ≃ 0.125, the value one might
expect from the ‘critical’ statistics relation χ ≃ 1/2(1 − D2)
if D2 ≃ 0.75.

for large R. However, for R ∼ 1 there is a regime, with
nearly linear slope, Σ2(L) ≃ χL for L ≫ 1 but L ≪ N .
We ﬁtted the slopes of the Σ2(L) to the best straight line
in the range L = 7 → 37. We note that the graphs are
not necessarily very linear everywhere: in certain regimes
there is a pronounced curvature. Nevertheless, the proce-
dure does give an indication of the average slope. While
the N = 2500 results may remain linear out to L ≈ 100,
the N = 625 results saturate at much lower L, hence the
L = 7 − 37 range is a compromise, good for all three cell
sizes.

In Fig.9 we plot the slopes χ (the level compressibili-
ties), for the 2δ−KR. We see that above R ≃ 1, there is,
relative to the QKR, a plateau in the level compressibil-
ity, where χ ≈ 0.12. This behaviour is completely absent
in the QKR: for R ≃ 1, the values of χ evolve rapidly
towards the GOE limit.

We recall the results [9] for the level compressibilities
of the Anderson MIT. It is predicted that asymptotically
the variances have a linear form, for L ≫ 1:

Σ2(L) ≈ χL,

(5.7)

χ ≈ 1/2(1 − D2/D) < 1

(5.8)

and D is the spatial dimension. D2 is a multifractal ex-
ponent related to the inverse participation ratio. This
behaviour corresponds [9], in the MIT, to return proba-
bilities which decay as P (t) ∼ t−D2 and is considered a
‘ﬁngerprint’ of critical systems, even in systems without
disorder such as the non-KAM billiards [17].

Here we calculate the return probabilities using the
eigenstates |αi and eigenvalues eiωα of the N-dimensional
matrix. We calculate

Pl(t) =

eiωα|hl|αi|2

(5.9)

(cid:12)
and average Pl(t) over diﬀerent starting conditions in the
trapping regions |li, exactly as in Eq.4.12.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Xl

We note that in Eq.4.12, the P (t) were obtained inde-
pendently of the eigenstates by direct time evolution of
a wavepacket in the unbounded system. The behaviour
in Fig.10 is very similar to that in Fig.5, and again a
decay rate P (t) ∼ t−0.75 is apparent. However, P (t) in
Fig.10 saturates to a larger value than for Fig.5, where
the wavepackets are not restricted to a ﬁnite cell. For
the ﬁnite N case P (t) → 2/N as t → ∞ (the factor of 2
is attributed to weak localization [29]). We also observe
that for R ≃ 1, in the regime with χ ∼ 0.125, wavepack-
ets started in the trapping regions localize too rapidly
to demonstrate the power-law decay. Nevertheless the
behaviour of χ is -numerically- consistent with a fractal
exponent D2 ≃ 0.75.

We see here that χ ≈ 0.125 = 1/2(1 − ν) would imply
ν ≈ 0.75, close to the exponent we obtained previously.
This indicates that here ν, the dominant exponent near

FIG. 11: Figure shows the eﬀect of delocalization onto multi-

a given eigenstate in the cell which contains its average mo-
mentum hpi. Well below the delocalization border, (d ≫ 2)
all states are fully contained in their assigned cell (barring a
few edge-states at the boundary of each cell). But, at the
‘delocalization border’ (d ≃ 2), a proportion of states have
appreciable probability in neighbouring cells – in fact about
2% of states have less than half of their probability in their
assigned cell. Results correspond to ǫ = 0.04,~ = 1/8 and

the golden-ratio cantori, may play a role equivalent to the
multi-fractal exponent D2 in the Anderson MIT. This is
a signiﬁcant result as such behaviour has not been seen
and is not expected in a KAM system [16].

Unlike the billiard systems, here phase-space is not
homogeneously ﬁlled with cantori. However, underly-
ing classical trajectories may spend considerable time
trapped within the fractal trapping regions which bor-
der the cell. The corresponding typical quantum states
for R > 1 also sample the cantori region, but localize
inhomogeneously in the fractal regions. As R increases,
however, the distribution delocalizes into a more typically
ergodic regime and the variances evolve towards the GOE
(Σ2(L) ∼ Ln L ) limit.

FIG. 12: Shows the eﬀects of delocalization onto multiple cells
on the spectral variances. Variances obtained with periodic
boundary conditions (N ≈ 1250) are compared with ‘open’
boundary conditions (Ntot = 10, 000 , N ≈ 1250,M = 51).
For d > 2, the eigenstates are well conﬁned within a single
cell and there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between ‘open’ and
‘closed’ BCs. When d < 2, the results are sensitive to the
BCs. While the ‘closed’ (periodic) BCs results tend to GOE,
the ‘open’ results revert towards Poissonian statistics.

values and eigenvectors. For our calculations the cell di-
mensions are in the range N ≃ 600 − 2500 and hence
each diagonalization spans NT OT /N cells (fewer are kept
since states in the cells at the edges of the matrix are dis-
carded).

For instance results presented below have ǫ = 0.04 and
~ = 1/8. Hence, each cell contains N = 2π/(~ǫ) ≃ 1257
states so each diagonalization obtains up to 7 complete
cells. Each full spectrum of length NT OT = 10, 000 is
now split into 8 single cell sub-spectra. We assign the
i − th eigenvalue to the m−th cell if

.

We calculate P (S) and variances separately for each of
these sub-spectra of length N = 1257. We then av-
erage the statistical distributions of 10-40 cells to ob-
tain smoother distributions. We diagonalize U ǫ for basis
states between l = 10, 000 − 20, 000 as easily as states be-
tween 70, 000 − 80, 000, for example, so as large a number
of sets of 7 sub-spectra may be obtained as required. For
the most delocalized spectra (with K = 14)only a sin-
gle central cell of about 1250 states was suﬃciently well
converged to be used for statistics.

Fig.10 investigates how much of the momentum prob-
ability for each eigenstate is contained in the cell it was
assigned to:
for R ≤ 1 and d > 2 the eigenstates are
essentially fully contained within the cells they are as-
signed to. However, at the onset of delocalization, this
procedure begins to fail; the expectation value pi of an
eigenstate may assign it to the m−th cell; however, most
of its probability may in fact be trapped in neighbouring

nalized to obtain cells of dimension N ≈ 1250) with ‘closed’
BCs (a ﬁnite matrix of dimension N ≈ 1250, M = 51 is diag-
onalized, with periodic BCs to retain unitarity). The results
are in excellent agreement before delocalization d > 2. Af-
ter delocalization d < 2, the ‘closed’ BCs tend to GOE, the
‘open’ BCs tend to Poissonian behaviour, providing a clear
signature of delocalization into multiple cells.

cells. This means that increasingly, the eigenvalues of
the sub-spectra become uncorrelated and we can expect
to see a return towards Poissonian statistics.

The apparent ‘failure’ of this procedure, in fact pro-
vides a good marker of delocalization from one-to-several
cells. In contrast, the periodic boundary conditions pre-
sented in the previous section, could indicate only the
degree of ‘ﬁlling’ of each single cell. Finally, we compare
the spectral ﬂuctuations for the two diﬀerent types of
boundary conditions (periodic vs open) in Figs.12-14. In
Fig.12 and Fig.13 we show that the spectral variances are
insensitive to the boundary conditions for d > 2. How-
ever for d < 2, the variances with periodic boundary con-
ditions gradually make a transition to GOE behaviour,
while the variances for the ‘open’ system begin to return
back to Poissonian statistics. Fig.14 shows that the NNS
distributions closely follow the same trends.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In conclusion, we have investigated the quantum be-
haviour of atoms exposed to pairs of δ-kicks and shown
that the cellular structure arises from a novel oscillatory
band structure of the corresponding unitary matrix. One
consequence is a new type of localization-delocalization
transition not seen in the QKR, where states delocalize
from a single cell to many, associated with a character-

istic spectral signature (the return to Poissonian statis-
tics).

We have also found certain scalings L ∼ ~−0.75 and
P (t) ∼ t−0.75 which we argue result from the bands of
cantori present on the borders of each cell. We argue also
that the 0.75 exponent may be identiﬁed with the domi-
nant stability exponent obtained previously near golden-
ratio cantori. We show that the spectral ﬂuctuations
(both the NNS and spectral variances) show important
diﬀerences with the QKR in regimes where the delocal-
ization of eigenstates is hindered by cantori. The numer-
ics provides evidence for behaviour somewhat analogous
to ‘critical’ statistics of non-KAM billiards (in particular
linear variances, with χ ≈ 0.125). These results are novel
but important questions remain: while the L ∼ ~−0.75
dependence might be explained thus, it remains unclear
why a similar exponent should also be found in the decay
of the return probabilities P (t) ∼ t−0.75. The question
of whether the ν = 0.75 exponent is somehow equiva-
lent to D2 in the MIT and non-KAM billiards (in other
words whether ν related to any underlying multifractal

in future.

By implication, the study shows that the behaviour
of cold atoms in double-pulsed standing waves of light
is quite diﬀerent from the single-pulsed systems. Some
aspects were already identiﬁed in the experiments of [1]
and may have applications in atom optics and atom chips,
possibly as a mechanism for selecting atoms according to
their momentum.

l and m, within the approximation of this Appendix, it
can be replaced by one of these. The substitution k0 = l
results in Eq.3.4.

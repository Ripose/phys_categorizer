Abstract

The ground state hyperﬁne splitting values of high Z hydrogenlike
ions are calculated. The relativistic, nuclear and QED corrections are
taken into account. The nuclear magnetization distribution correc-
tion (the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect) is evaluated within the single particle
model with the gS-factor chosen to yield the observed nuclear moment.
An additional contribution caused by the nuclear spin-orbit interac-
tion is included in the calculation of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect. It is
found that the theoretical value of the wavelength of the transition
between the hyperﬁne splitting components in 165Ho66+ is in good
agreement with experiment.

1 Introduction

Laser spectroscopic measurement of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting in
hydrogenlike 209Bi82+ [1] has triggered great interest to calculations of this
value (see [2-7] and references therein). Recently the transition between the
F = 4 and F = 3 hyperﬁne splitting levels of the ground state in hydrogenlike
165Ho66+ was observed [8] and its wavelength was determined to be 572.79(15)
nm.
It was found [8] that this value is in disagreement with commonly
tabulated values of the nuclear dipole magnetic moment of 165Ho (see, e.g.,
[9]) and in good agreement with the value that was measured by Nachtsheim
[10] and compiled by Peker [11].

The hyperﬁne splitting values of 165Ho66+ (for the magnetic moment from
[9]) and other possible candidates for such experiments were evaluated, with-
out QED corrections, in [4]. In the present paper we reﬁne the calculations
of [4] considering a more accurate treatment of the nuclear eﬀects and taking
into account the QED corrections.

2 Basic formulas and calculations

The ground state hyperﬁne splitting of hydrogenlike ions is conveniently writ-
ten in the form [4,12]

To calculate the nuclear charge distribution correction δ we used the two-

parameter Fermi model:

ρ(r) =

ρ0
1 + exp [(r − c)/a]

(3)

The parameters c, a and hr2i1/2 have been taken from [15]. We found that
the error due to an uncertainty of the nuclear charge distribution parameters
is much smaller than an uncertainty of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect. The Bohr-
Weisskopf eﬀect was calculated assuming that the magnetizations can be
ascribed to the single particle structure of the nucleus with the eﬀective gS-
factor chosen to yield the observed nuclear magnetic moment. The nucleon
wave functions were calculated by the Schr¨odinger equation with the Woods-
Saxon potential [16-17]

U(r) = V (r) + VSO(r) + VCoul(r) ,

where

V (r) = −V0f (r) ,

3 fm, V0 = 58.7
RSO = 1.280A
MeV, RSO = 0.932A
3 fm, λ = 17.8 for proton. Despite these parameters
were chosen to give reasonable binding energies for the lead region alone, we
used them at lower Z as well. We found that the uncertainty of the Bohr-
Weisskopf eﬀect caused by possible changes of these parameters [18,19] is
small in comparison with an expected error due to deviation from the single
particle model.

As is known [20], the SO interaction gives an additional contribution
to the nuclear magnetic moment. Taking into account the related term in
the hyperﬁne splitting theory gives an additional contribution to the Bohr-
Weisskopf eﬀect. If we denote the SO interaction by

VSO(r) = φSO(r)(s · l) ,

the total expressions for the Bohr-Weisskopf correction within the single par-
ticle approximation are given by

In the third and fourth columns of the table 1 we present the values
gS and ε calculated by equations (6)-(9). As one can see from the table,
except 159T b and 127I, the values gS lie between the free Dirac and free real
g-factors. For comparison, in the ﬁfth column we give the values ε found
in disregarding the spin-orbit terms in equations (6)-(9) (it corresponds to
the calculation using the original Bohr-Weisskopf formulas [14]). In the last
column we give the values ε found in [4] by using a simple, homogeneous
over the nucleus, distribution of |u(r)|2. (We note here that in the case of
209Bi82+ in [4] a more accurate evaluation of ε was also presented which
gave ε = 0.013 and λ = 242.0 nm, without the QED correction. The same
value was found in [21].) Taking into account that the single particle model
with the eﬀective gS-factor gives reasonable agreement with experiment for
neutral atoms [22,23], we assume the following errors bars for ε. For the ions
where the spin and orbital parts in (6)-(7) are of the same sign (it results
in relatively large values of ε) the uncertainty is about 30% of ε. For the
ions where the spin and orbital parts in (6)-(7) are of the opposite sign (it
results in relatively small values of ε) the uncertainty is about 20% of hKSi (
0.2hKSi ∼ 0.03αZb, where b is a factor tabulated in [4]). In the case of P b the
uncertainty is assumed to be about 10% of ε. It should be stressed however
that the uncertainty found in this way is to be considered only as the order of
the expected error. More accurate calculations of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect
must be based on the many particle nuclear models and must include a more
consequent procedure for determination of the error bars.

The radiative correction is the sum of the vacuum polarization (VP) and
self energy (SE) contributions. The VP contribution can easily be calculated
within the Uehling approximation. We calculated this eﬀect for a ﬁnite
nucleus charge distribution and found that for Z=82, 83 our results are in
good agreement with the results of [3,6]. The values of the electric loop
and magnetic loop contributions in the Uehling approximation are given in
the second and third columns of the table 2. The Wichman-Kroll (WK)
contribution is also the sum of two terms. The ﬁrst term is given by the
WK electric loop correction to the electron wave function. The calculation
of this term can be done in the same way as the calculation of the ﬁrst
order WK contribution. The results of such a calculation, based on using the
approximate formulas for the WK potential for a point nucleus [24], are given
in the fourth column of the table. The second term is the WK magnetic loop
contribution. Calculation of this term is a more complex problem. However,
calculations of the corresponding term in the VP screening diagrams for
two-electron ions [25] allow us to expect that this term is small enough. In
the ﬁfth column of the table 2 the total VP contribution, without the WK
magnetic loop term, is given. The SE contribution was evaluated in [6,26]
in a wide interval of Z for a ﬁnite nuclear size distribution. The values
of this contribution given in the sixth column of the table 2 are found by
interpolation of the related values from [26]. In the last column of the table
the total radiative correction is listed.

In the table 3 we give the theoretical values of the energies and the
wavelengths of the transition between the ground state hyperﬁne splitting
components of high Z hydrogenlike ions. The error bars given in the table
are mainly deﬁned by the uncetainty of the Bohr-Wesskopf eﬀect discussed
above. The magnetic moment values, except Ho [10,11,8], are taken from[9].
In the case of Ho, the theoretical value constitutes λ = 572.5(1.7) nm and
is in good agreement with experiment λ = 572.79(15) nm [8]. The values
of the individual contributions are listed in the table 4. In the case of Bi
the diﬀerence between the experimental value (λ = 243.87(2) nm [1]) and
the theoretical value given in the table 3 is within the expected error of the
Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect. We expect that these theoretical results will be re-
ﬁned by including the RPA approximation in a more elaborate treatment of
the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect [5], based on the dynamic-correlation model [27].
Such calculations are underway and will be published elsewhere.

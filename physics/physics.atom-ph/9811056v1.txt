Abstract

A general expression for the cross sections of inelastic collisions of fast (includ-

ing relativistic) multicharged ions with atoms which is based on the genelazition of

the eikonal approximation is derived. This expression is applicable for wide range

of collision energy and has the standard nonrelativistic limit and in the ultrarel-

ativistic limit coincides with the Baltz’s exact solution [1] of the Dirac equation.

As an application of the obtained result the following processes are calculated: the

excitation and ionization cross sections of hydrogenlike atom; the single and double

excitation and ionization of heliumlike atom; the multiply ionization of neon and

argon atoms; the probability and cross section of K-vacancy production in the rel-
U 91+ collision. The simple analytic formulae for the cross sections
ativistic U 92+

−

of inelastic collisions and the recurrence relations between the ionization cross sec-

tions of diﬀerent multiplicities are also obtained. Comparison of our results with

the experimental data and the results of other calculations are given.

Introduction

Study of inelastic processes in the collision of atoms with fast (including

relativistic) highly charged ions has been a subject of considerable interest

recently. One of motivation for this interest is the anticipated large eﬀec-

tive ﬁeld strength creating by highly charged ions which exceeds internal

atomic ﬁeld strength. Creating such a ﬁelds by the another methods is very

complicated problem presently. Thus up to now, collision experiments with

highly charged ions are the only way for investigating atoms and molecules

in superstrong ﬁelds. From the fundamental viewpoint study of behavior of

matter in superstrong electromagnetic ﬁelds is one of the important prob-

lems of modern physics. Furthermore, a number of applied problems such

as measuring of energy spectrum of nuclear ﬁssion, synthesis of superheavy

elements, interpretation of data on superheavy cosmic rays, ion diagnostics

and spectroscopy of plasma, etc., stimulate the extensive study of collisions

of highly charged ions with atoms. Among such a processes collisions of

fast and relativistic highly charged ions with atoms are of great interest

due to the anticipated large cross sections. Therefore these processes are

also of applied importance.

The theoretical methods used for relativistic collisions are very similar

to those applied for nonrelativistic collision energies and have mainly the

perturbative character. The relativistic treatment within the plan wave

Born approximation dates back to M¨oller [2] and has been further devel-

oped by Jamnikand Zupancic [3] , Davidovich et.al

[4] and by Anholt

[5]. As is well known [6] in a relativistic ion -atom collisions perturba-

tion theory begins to break down for large projectile charges (for Z

75).

≥

For example the well known Born approximation leads to a result in which

(for small impact parameters) the ionization probability exceeds unity. For

2

this reason nonperturbative methods for calculation of such processes are

needed. Presently a few nonperturbative results are available. Becker

et.al.

[7] used a ﬁnite diﬀerence method to solve the Dirac equation for

U 92+

U 91+ collisions at 1 GeV/u on a discretized grid. Recently Baltz

[1] have obtained exact solution of the Dirac equation for relativistic heavy

ion collisions in the ultrarelativistic limit. Another nonperturbative meth-

ods of calculation of cross section such inelastic processes are the Glauber

approximation [8, 9, 10] and sudden approximation [11, 12, 13]. In this

work using the eikonal approximation we obtain a general expression for

the cross section of inelastic collision of fast as well as relativistic highly

charged ion with complex atom. This expression is applicable for wide

range of collision energies and has the standard nonrelativistic limit and

in the ultrarelativistic limit coincides with the Baltz’s exact solution [1]

of the time-dependent Dirac equation. As an application of the obtained

result excitation and ionization cross sections of hydrogenlike atom, single

and double excitation and ionization of heliumlike atom, multiply ioniza-

tion (up to eightfold) of neon atom and (up to eighteen) of argon atom,

probability and cross section of the K-vacancy production in the relativistic

U 92+

U 91+ collision are calculated. The simple analytic formulae for the

cross sections of inelastic collisions and the recurrence relations between

the ionization cross sections of diﬀerent multiplicities are also obtained.

Comparison of our results with the experimental data as well as the results

b. One should note that in this form this probability coincides with exact

one obtained by Baltz [1] for the ultrarelativistic case and has a standard

nonrelativistic limit [15]. For long-range potentials integral in (4) diverges

for large impact parameters. However, as is known, such a divergence

is not considerable [9, 17], since for large impact parameters the Born

approximation can be applied. There is a region in which the regions of

applicability of Born and eikonal approximations overlap one which other.

This allows a correct matching of cross sections over the impact parameter.

Consider this matching in the case of K-vacancy production in the col-

lision of relativistic heavy ion with heavy atoms when the transition of the

atomic K-shell-electron from the state

Obtained formulae are of the general character and can be applied to

the collisions of atoms with ions of arbitrary charges. Speciﬁcity of the

collisions of highly charged ions with atoms is the fact that the cross sec-

tions of such collisions are large enough (considerably exceeding atomic

sizes). This enables one to use for the calculations of the cross section the

large impact parameter approximation ( 5).

In this case the procedure

of mathcing is most simply applicable for the collsions of relativistic ions

with nonrelativistic (before and after collision 1) atoms.

These facts allow us to obtain simple analitical expressions for the cross

sections by matching.

1Strictly speaking, atomic electrons appearing in the continuum in the result of ionization by the

impact of relativistic ion can take relativistic velocities. However, as is shown in [9] such a processes

occur for the small impact parameters and corresponding contributions to the full ionization cross section

by the impact of highly charged ion can be neglected.

To show the character of obtaining by the matching results we give in

ﬁg.1 the ionization cross sections obtained: in the Born approximation - 1;

by matching (formula ( 15))- 2; in the Glauber approximation [8] - 3; in the

sudden approximation [17] - 4. As is seen from this ﬁgure formula ( 15) in

the region of its applicability (v

Glauber approximation and tends to the Born approximation by increasing

our results are obtained in the analytical form.

Excitation and ionization of nonrelativistic heliumlike

atom

When one uses the perturbation theory for the calculations of inelastic

cross sections of collisions of fast charged particles with complex atom the

one-electron excitation and ionization are the ﬁrst-order eﬀects. The two-

electron transitions are the second order eﬀects of perturbation theory,

when the interaction of projectile with atomic electrons and interelectron

interaction are taken into account once.

Analogously other many-electron transitions can be calculated: i.e., the

interaction of projectile with atomic electrons accounts only once and all

other interactions correspond to the interelectron correlation which should

be accounted necessary times. However situation changes when the inter-

action of atomic electrons with projectile is considerably large than the

correlation of atomic electrons. In this case the many-electron transition

should be considered [26, 22, 9] as a result of direct interaction of projec-

11

tile’s strong ﬁeld. Formulae ( 1, 2) and ( 4) correspond [9] to the such

a mechanism of direct interaction. Below we give the expressions for the

total cross sections of one- and two-electron transitions from ground state

of nonrelativistic heliumlike atom in the collision with relativistic highly

charged ion, obtained in the large impact parameter approximation ( 5).

In all the cases two-electron states of the heliumlike atom are described in

the form of symmetrized product of hydrogenlike one-electron wave func-

tions. In order to avoid orthogonolization procedure (which is not simply

deﬁned) we choose the one-electron hydrogenlike wave functions with ef-

fective charge equal: Z1 - for one-electron transitions, Z2 -for two-electron

transitions. Let’s denote via

n1, n2 > two-electron states of heliumlike
|

atom with two set of one-electron hydrogenlike quantum numbers n1 and

n2. Then the cross section ( 4) of transition from the ground state

to state

(22)

Thus the cross section is expressed by the integral (over the impact param-

eter) from the product of the well known hydrogenlike formfactors [15].

The cross sections of two-electron transitions (when the states of both elec-

tron change) can be obtained directly from ( 22) by integrating over the

hole plan of impact parameters. The cross sections of inelastic processes

which include one-electron transitions (for example, single excitation or

ionization, total inelastic cross sections) can be obtained by matching with

perturbation theory. Therefore these formulae logorithmically depend on

the projectile velocity and relativistic factor γ = 1/

v2/c2.

As an another example of two-electron transition to the discrete state we

give the excitation cross sections of autoionization states of heliumlike atom

with principial quantum number n = 2 (L-shell). Since in the considered

collisions the spins of the electrons can not change, the excitations of the

following autoionization states are possible : 2s2 1S, 2s2p 1P , 2p2 1S

2p2 1D.

The corresponding cross sections are

In the table 1 the experimental data (for excitation of autoionization

states), the results of our calculations and the results of calculations from

[19] are compared. The results are given for the sum of (2s2p + 2p2)

excitaion cross sections for helium atom; Column 1 is the projectile energy

per nucleon; column 2 is the projectile charge; column 3 is the experimental

result; column 4 is the our result (Z2 = 1.97); column 5 is the result of

numerical calculations from [19].

In Fig.2 the results of experiments from [20], the results of calculations

obtained using formulae ( 25) and ( 23) for the cross section of double

(Z2 = 1.97) and single (Z1 = 1, 37) ionization of helium atom in the
collision with U 90+ (with energies 60, 120 420 Mev/n) as well as the ratio

σ2+/σ1+ are given. Correctness of the choice for values of the eﬀective

charges Z1 = 1.37 and Z2 = 1.97 is conﬁrmed by the good accordance of

our results given in table 2 with the experimental ones from [21, 22].

The above data for the single ionization cross section (σ1+) as well as

the sum of cross sections σ1+ and σ2

∗ can be used for the estimations

of total cross section of formation of one-electron helium ions as a result

of direct ionization and Auger decay of various doubly excited states of

helium atom, since for light atoms Auger decay is the dominating decay

channel of doubly excited states (excluding comparitively small number of

doubly excited states for which Auger decay is forbidden by selection rules

Excitation and ionization of nonrelativistic complex

Though strong ﬁeld of highly charged ion leads to high ionization prob-

abilities, in the case of multiple ionization and excitation the large im-

pact parameter approximation ( 5) can break down, due to the fact that

corresponding cross section may become comparable with atomic sizes.

Therefore more general consideration on the ground of formula ( 4) is

needed. Let’s consider the electrons of nonrelativistic (before and af-

ter collision) multielectron atom as distinguishable and each electron de-

scribed by hydrogenlike wave function. Then the initial wave function.

ﬁnal one is Ψf (r1, . . . , rN0) =

bility of (N0 −
approximation [26, 27]. However the eﬀective charge Z ∗ of the atomic

nucleus depends on the ionization degree. In order to account this fact we

make in ( 31) the following substitutions k = k/Z ∗, b = bZ ∗, r = rZ ∗,

corresponding to the transition to Coulomb units

[15]. Then left side

with unit charge. Below p(b) will mean the avareged by ( 31) hydrogen

cross section for general (than independent electron approximation) cases.

K-vacancy production in the collisions with heavy atoms

In this section the above results on the eikonal approximation are ap-

plied for the calculation of probabability and cross section of K-vacancy

production in the collision of relativistic highly charged ions with heavy

(relativistic) atoms. As was mentioned above the integrand in (4) can

be interpreted as the probability of transition from state

ψi > to state

|

ψf > in the collision with the impact parameter b. Direct calculation of

the probability can be performed only numerically. Therefore we assume

the following simpliﬁcations:

a) We will use the large impact parameter approximation (5)

b) The target atom is considered as a quasirelativistic i.e.,

The ionization probability (as a function of impact parameter) calculated

using this formula for U 92+-U 91+ collision is given in Fig.6. As is seen

from this ﬁgure our approach based on the eikonal approximation gives,

for small impact parameters, an ionization probability which is less than

unity. Let’s calculate now the K-vacancy production cross section using

the formula ( 11). The above simpliﬁcations a) and b) leads to the formula

( 8) which is of the same form as the formula ( 12) but in this formula as

the wave functions

ψi > and

ψf > are taken Darwin and Zommerfeld-

Mau wave functions. Therefore in the calculations of λi, αi and ωi the

dependence on Za cannot be factorized and the quantities λi, αi and ωi as

a functions of Za should be calculated nimerically. As an example of such

calculation in Fig. 7 the dependence of K-vacancy production cross section

on the relativistic factor γ is given for U 92+-U 91+ collision .

Conclusion

Thus we have derived general formulas for cross section which are applica-

ble in the case of collisions of atoms with ions of arbitrary charge. These

obtained formulae are applied to the (analitically and numerical) calcu-

lations of the following processes: 1) the excitation and ionization cross

sections of (nonrelativistic) hydrogenlike and heliumlike atoms in the coll-

sions with relativistic highly charged ions;

2) the probability and cross section of K-vacancy production in the rela-

tivistic U 92+-U 91+ collision;

19

3) the multiple (up to 8 for Ne and up to 18 for Ar) ionization cross sections

in the collision of complex atoms with relativistic highly charged ions.

We also have obtained simple analytical expressions for inelastic cross

sections and derived recurrence relations between the cross sections of var-

ious multiplicities. Obtained theoretical results are compared with the

experimental data.

Besides that the above calculations of cross section and ionization prob-

ability, using the eikonal approximation, enables to avoid some diﬃculties

appearing in the case of application of perturbation theory to the rela-

tivistic highly charged ion -heavy atom collisions and leads to the result

coinciding, in the ultrarelativistic limit, with the known exact one.

Energies of 6s2npj (n = 6–9), 6s2ns1/2 (n = 7–9), 6s2ndj (n = 6–8), and 6s2nf5/2 (n = 5–6)

states in Tl I and Pb II are obtained using relativistic many-body perturbation theory. Reduced

matrix elements, oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes are determined for the 72 pos-

sible 6s2nlj − 6s2n′l′

elements are evaluated to obtain 6s2np3/2 − 6s2mp1/2 (n, m = 6, 7) transition rates. Hyperﬁne

constants A are evaluated for 6s2npj (n = 6–9), 6s2ns1/2 (n = 7–9), and 6s2ndj (n = 6–8) states

in 205Tl. First-, second-, third-, and all-order corrections to the energies and matrix elements and

ﬁrst- and second-order Breit corrections to energies are calculated. In our implementation of the

all-order method, single and double excitations of Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all

INTRODUCTION

The ground-state energy of thallium, treated as a one-electron system, was calculated

by Dzuba et al. [1] using perturbation theory in a screened Coulomb interaction (PTSCI),

by Blundell et al. [2] using third-order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), and by

Liu and Kelly [3] using the coupled-cluster (CC) approach. Second-order MBPT energies

of thallium were evaluated for the ground and excited states (6p1/2, 6p3/2, 7s1/2, and 7p1/2)

in Hartley and Martensson-Pendrill [4], where hyperﬁne constants for the four states listed

above and electric-dipole transition matrix elements 7s − 6p1/2, 7s − 7p1/2, and 7s − 6p3/2

were also evaluated. In all of the above calculations the three-electron state 6s2nl with 78

core electrons was considered as a one-electron nl system with an 80 electron core [Hg].

Thallium was treated as three-particle system in Johnson et al. [5], where energies of

low-lying excited states were calculated using second-order relativistic MBPT starting from

a frozen core V (N −3) HF potential. A combined MBPT plus conﬁguration-interaction (CI)

method was employed in Dzuba et al. [6, 7] to evaluate the Tl I ionization potential and

the ﬁrst few energy levels. This method was also used recently by Kozlov et al. [8] to

calculate energies and hyperﬁne constants for seven low-lying states, dipole matrix elements

between those states, and the parity nonconserving (PNC) E1 amplitude for the 6p1/2 −6p3/2

transition in 205Tl. A review of all previous papers regarding calculations of the PNC E1

amplitude in Tl is given in Ref. [8] and therefore omitted from the present discussion.

The lifetime of the 7 2S1/2 state in Tl was measured using the optical double-resonance

technique and the level-crossing technique by Gallagher and Lurio [9]; this lifetime was also

measured using the zero-ﬁeld level-crossing (Hanle eﬀect) technique by Norton and Gallagher

[10]. Lifetimes of the n 2Pj states in Tl I (n = 7 − 11) were determined in Refs. [11, 12]

through measurements of the ﬂuorescence signal resulting from two-photon excitation in

an atomic beam. Level-crossing spectroscopy with pulsed two-photon excitation was used

in [13, 14, 15] to determine lifetimes for n 2P3/2 (n = 8, 9) states and hyperﬁne splitting
for n 2P3/2 (n = 8 − 11) states. Measurement of the electric-quadrupole amplitude for
the 1283 nm 6 2P1/2 − 6 2P3/2 transition in Tl I was reported by Majumder and Tsai [16].

Spectroscopic studies of the plasma generated in a thallium arc were reported by Alonso-

Medina in Refs. [17, 18]. Relative transition probabilities for the 18 infrared lines arising

from excited doublets in Tl I (n 2S1/2−7 2Pj, n 2D3/2−7 2Pj, n 2P3/2−6 2Dj) were determined

2

from emission line-intensity measurements of an optically-thin light source [17]. The optical
emission spectra (2000 ˚A-15000 ˚A) of a plasma produced in a Tl arc lamp were recorded and

analyzed to obtain relative transition probabilities for 26 lines (n 2S1/2 −6 2PJ, n 2DJ ′ −6 2PJ,
n 2PJ − 7 2S1/2) in Tl I [18].

Lifetimes of the 7 2S1/2, 7 2PJ, 7 2D3/2, 5 2FJ , and 6 2F5/2 levels of Pb II were measured by

Gorshkov and Verolainen [19] using the multichannel method of delayed coincidences. The

lifetime of the metastable 6 2P3/2 level of Pb II was measured experimentally by Roth et al.

[20] using the ion storage technique and time-resolved registration of the subsequent decay

photons. Relative transition probabilities of 30 Pb II lines arising from excited doublet

levels were obtained by Alonso-Medina in Refs. [21, 22]. Transition probabilities for 30

lines involving S, P , D, and F levels of Pb II were determined from a hollow cathode

discharge by Alonso-Medina [21]. In Refs. [22, 23], transition probabilities of Pb II were

determined from the values of intensities obtained using the emission of a plasma generated

by focusing a laser beam on a Pb target. Calculations of Pb II properties including a

potential model to represent the core polarization of Pb II were reported by Migdalek [24]

and by Alonso-Medina [21]. Oscillator strengths and relative line strengths for the 6 2PJ −
n 2S1/2 transitions (n = 7 − 11) and 7 2PJ − n 2S1/2 transitions with (n = 8 − 11) were
presented in Ref. [24]. Transition probabilities for the 7 2PJ − n 2S1/2 (n = 8 − 11), 7 2PJ −
n 2DJ ′ (n = 7, 8, 10), 7 2S1/2 − 7 2PJ , and 6 2DJ − n 2FJ ′ (n = 5 − 7) transitions were

calculated by Alonso-Medina [21]. The relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) Cowan code was

used by Biemont and Quinet [25], to calculate the 6 2P1/2 − 6 2P3/2 magnetic-dipole and

electric-quadrupole transition probabilities in Tl I and Pb II. Magnetic-dipole and electric-

quadrupole transition rates for n 2P1/2−n′ 2P3/2 transitions (n, n′ = 6, 7) in Tl were presented

by Neuﬀer and Commins [26], where valence-electron wave functions were generated as

numerical solutions of the Dirac equation in a modiﬁed Tietz central potential. Transition

probabilities for 190 lines arising from the 6s2ns 2S1/2, 6s2np 2PJ, 6s2nd 2DJ , 6s2nf 2FJ ,
6s6p2 2S1/2, 2,4PJ , 2,4DJ levels in Pb II were calculated recently by Colon and Alonso-

Medina [27] also using the Cowan code. Theoretical lifetimes were also calculated in [27] for

those levels for which lifetimes measurements were given in [19]. Pb II was detected with the

Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in several stars

[28] and radiative properties of Pb II are needed to derive various astrophysical parameters.

In the present paper, energies of the 6s2npj (n = 6 − 9), 6s2ns1/2 (n = 7 − 9), 6s2ndj (n =

3

6−8), and 6s2nf5/2 (n = 5−6) states in Tl I and Pb II are obtained using relativistic MBPT.

We carry out third-order and all-order calculations of energies, transition amplitudes, and

hyperﬁne constants. Second-order Breit corrections to energies are also calculated. Here,

we treat the three-electron system 6s2nl with a 78 electron core as a one-electron system nl

with an 80 electron [Hg] core, permitting us to use experience from previous MBPT studies

of atomic properties in systems with one valence electron Refs. [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,

36, 37, 38]. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes are

determined for the 72 possible nlj − n′l′

j′ electric-dipole transitions. Electric-quadrupole and
magnetic-dipole matrix elements are evaluated for np1/2 − mp3/2 (m, n = 6, 7) transitions.

We investigate the hyperﬁne structure in 205Tl to determine the hyperﬁne constants A for

the 6s2npj (n = 6 − 9), 6s2ns1/2 (n = 7 − 9), and 6s2ndj (n = 6 − 8) states in 205Tl.

II. THIRD-ORDER MBPT CALCULATIONS OF ENERGIES OF TL I AND PB II

Results of our third-order calculations of energies, which are carried out following the

method described in [32, 38], are summarized in Table I, where we list lowest-order Dirac-

Fock energies E(0), ﬁrst-order Breit energies B(1), second-order Coulomb E(2) and Breit B(2)

energies, third-order Coulomb energies E(3), single-particle Lamb shift corrections E LS, and

the sum of the above Etot. The ﬁrst-order Breit energies include retardation, whereas the

second-order Breit energies are evaluated using the unretarded Breit operator. The Lamb

shift is approximated as the sum of the one-electron self energy and the ﬁrst-order vacuum-

polarization energy. The vacuum-polarization contribution is calculated from the Uehling

potential using the results of Fullerton and Rinker [39]. The self-energy contribution is

estimated for the s, p1/2 and p3/2 orbitals by interpolating among the values obtained by

Mohr [40, 41, 42] using Coulomb wave functions. For this purpose, an eﬀective nuclear

charge Zeﬀ is obtained by ﬁnding the value of Zeﬀ required to give a Coulomb orbital with

the same average hri as the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) orbital.

We ﬁnd that the correlation corrections to energies in neutral Tl and Tl-like Pb are

large, especially for the 6p states. For example, E(2) is about 20% of E(0) and E(3) is about

40% of E(2) for the 6pj states of neutral Tl. Despite the evident slow convergence of the

perturbation theory expansion, the 6p1/2 energy from the third-order MBPT calculation is

within 0.2% of the measured ionization energy for the 6p1/2 state of neutral Tl and improves

4

for higher valence states and for Pb+ (0.03%). The order of levels changes from Tl to Pb+.

For example, the 5f5/2 and 6f5/2 states, which are in the thirteenth and nineteenth places for

neutral Tl, are in the ninth and ﬁfteenth places for Pb+. In two last columns of Table I, we

compare our results for the energy levels of the 19 single-particle states of interest in Tl I and

Pb II with recommended values from the National Institute of Standards and Technology

(NIST) database [43]. Although our results are generally in good agreement with the NIST

data, discrepancies are found. One cause for these discrepancies is the omission of the

fourth- and higher-order correlation corrections in the theoretical values. A second possible

cause is the omission of three-particle interactions in our single-particle model space. The

importance of 6s26d + 6s6p2 mixing for Tl I was emphasized by Johnson et al. [5]. Moreover,

Colon and Alonso-Medina [27] included the 6s6p2 states in calculations used to classify the

observed spectrum of Pb II.

We use B-splines [44] to generate a complete set of basis DHF wave functions for use in

the evaluation of MBPT expressions. For Tl I and Pb II, we use 40 splines of order k = 7

for each angular momentum. The basis orbitals are constrained to cavities of radii R = 85

a.u. and R = 65 a.u. for Tl I and Pb II, respectively. The cavity radius is chosen large

enough to accommodate all 6lj and 5fj orbitals considered here and small enough that 40

splines can approximate inner-shell DHF wave functions with good precision. We include

35 out of 40 basis orbitals for each partial wave in our third-order energy calculations,

since the contributions from the ﬁve highest-energy orbitals are negligible. The second-

order calculation includes partial waves up to lmax = 8 and is extrapolated to account for

contributions from higher partial waves. A lower number of partial waves, lmax = 6, is

used in the third-order calculation. Since the asymptotic l-dependence of the second- and

third-order energies are similar (both fall oﬀ as l−4), we use the second-order remainder as

a guide when extrapolating the third-order energy.

III. ALL-ORDER SD CALCULATIONS OF TL I AND PB II ENERGIES

Results of our all-order SD calculations for the 19 lowest states in neutral Tl and Tl-like Pb

ion are presented in Table II, where we list lowest-order (DHF) energies E(0), SD correlation
energies ESD, omitted third-order terms E(3)

extra, ﬁrst- and second-order Breit corrections to
energies B(n), n = 1, 2, single-particle Lamb shift corrections E LS, totals E tot, and values

5

from NIST, ENIST [43]. The method used to evaluate ESD is described in Refs. [33, 34,

35, 36, 37, 38]. The SD equations are set up in a ﬁnite basis and solved iteratively to give

the single- and double-excitation coeﬃcients and the correlation energy ESD. Contributions
E(3)

extra in Table II account for that part of the third-order MBPT correction not included in

the SD energy (see Eq. (2.16) in Ref. [45]). The basis orbitals used to deﬁne single-particle

states are linear combinations of B-splines as in the third-order calculation above.

Comparing Tables I and II shows that the second-order term E(2) is the dominant con-

tribution to ESD, as expected. We have already mentioned the importance of higher partial

wave contributions to E(2) and E(3). In the SD calculation, we include partial waves through
l=6 in ESD and use the diﬀerence E(2) - E(2)

l≤6 to extrapolate our result.

The column labeled δE in Table II gives diﬀerences between our ab initio results and the

recommended values [43]. The SD results agree better with the recommended values than do

the third-order MBPT results, except for the ionization potential. This conﬁrms our previous

comments concerning the slow convergence of the perturbation theory and illustrates the

importance of fourth- and higher-order correlation corrections. Those diﬀerences between

the present theoretical results and the recommended values that were not improved by the

SD method are most probably due to the omission of three-particle interactions mentioned

previously.

IV. ELECTRIC-DIPOLE MATRIX ELEMENTS, OSCILLATOR STRENGTHS,

TRANSITION RATES, AND LIFETIMES IN TL I AND PB II

Transition matrix elements provide another test of the quality of atomic-structure calcu-

lations and another measure of the size of correlation corrections. Reduced electric-dipole

matrix elements between low-lying states of Tl I and Pb II calculated to third order and in

the SD approximation are presented in Table III. First-order reduced matrix elements Z (1)

are obtained from DHF calculations, second-order reduced matrix elements Z (2) include Z (1)

and the second-order correction associated with the random-phase approximation (RPA).

All results given Table III are obtained in length form for matrix elements. Length-form

and velocity-form matrix elements diﬀer typically by 1 - 10% for DHF matrix elements and

1 - 3 % for the second-order matrix elements.

The third-order matrix elements Z (3) include Z (RPA) (all higher-order RPA corrections),

6

third-order Bruekner-orbital Z (BO), structural radiation Z (SR), and normalization Z (NORM)

corrections, described in Refs. [45, 46]. We ﬁnd second-order RPA corrections to be very

large, 10-40%, being the smallest for the 7pj-7dj′ transitions.

Electric-dipole matrix elements evaluated in the SD approximation are given in columns

labeled Z (SD) in Table III. A detailed discussion of the calculations of matrix elements

in the SD approximation is found in Refs. [33, 36, 37, 38, 45]. It should be noted that SD

matrix elements Z SD include Z (3) completely, along with important fourth- and higher-order

corrections. The fourth-order corrections omitted from SD matrix elements were discussed

recently by Derevianko and Emmons [47].

In Table IV, we compare our SD data Z (SD) for reduced matrix elements of the dipole

operator in Tl I with theoretical Z (theor) and experimental Z (expt) data given by Kozlov et al.

[8] and references therein. Our SD data are in excellent agreement with experimental and

theoretical data from Refs. [7, 8] obtained by combining MBPT and CI methods.

Transition rates Ar (s−1), oscillator strengths (f ), and line strengths S (a.u.) for tran-

sitions in Tl I and Pb II calculated in SD approximation are summarized in Tables V and

VI, respectively. It should be noted that we use theoretical energies obtained in the SD ap-

proximation in the evaluation of transition rates and oscillator strengths. For convenience,

we present wavelengths for all transitions in Tables V and VI calculated using the SD ap-

proximation. The largest oscillator strengths agree with experimental results within the

corresponding uncertainties in many cases.

In Table VII we compare transition rates Ar (106s−1) and wavelengths λ (˚A) in Tl I and

Pb II with available experimental measurements given in Refs. [9, 17, 18] for Tl I and in

Refs. [23, 27] for Pb II. The SD dipole matrix elements and energies are used to obtain results
given in columns labeled A(SD)

and λ(SD). Our SD results for the wavelengths are in excellent

r

agreement with experimental wavelengths; the discrepancies are about 0.01–0.1%. Experi-

mental results for transition rates were given in Refs. [9, 17, 18, 23, 27] with an estimated

error of 10%. Our SD values for transition rates agree in many cases with experimental

results within the experimental uncertainties. However, we found huge disagreements for

two transitions, 7s1/2 − 8p1/2 and 6d3/2 − 8p1/2 in Pb II. For the ﬁrst transition, 7s1/2 − 8p1/2,

the RPA contribution is very important (compare Z (1) and Z (2) in Table III); for the sec-

ond transition, 6d3/2 − 8p1/2, the BO contribution is largest (Z (1)=0.3065, Z (BO)=-0.3063)

cancelling almost exactly the lowest-order contribution. Such large correlation contributions

7

are responsible for the large diﬀerence between our the third-order and SD results and the

lowest-order DHF results. All previous calculations for transitions rates in Pb II were based

on the relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) Cowan code (Refs. [21, 27]) and those data were used
for experimental estimates of transition rates presented in column with heading A(expt.)

of

r

Table VII.

We calculate lifetimes of the npj, ns1/2 (n = 7 − 9), ndj (n = 6 − 8), and nf5/2 (n = 5 − 6)

states in Tl I and Pb II using both third-order MBPT and SD results for dipole matrix

elements and energies. We list lifetimes τ (SD) obtained using SD method in Table VIII. In

this table, we compare our calculated lifetimes with available experimental measurements

that are primarily obtained for npj levels. The experimental data for Tl I are from Refs. [10,

12] and the Pb II data are from Ref. [27] and references therein. Experimental results for

τ expt were given in Refs. [12] and [27] with 5% and 10% errors, respectively. Our SD results

are in excellent agreement with experimental results except for one case, 7s1/2 state in Pb II.
This is unexpected since we have perfect agreement between the τ SD and τ expt from Ref. [10]

for 7s1/2 state in Tl I. As one can see from Table VIII, the values of lifetime in Tl I are

larger than the values of lifetime in Pb II by a factor of 4. In this case, it seems strange that

τ expt for the 7s1/2 state in Pb II is almost identical with τ expt for the 7s1/2 state in Tl I.

V. ELECTRIC-QUADRUPOLE AND MAGNETIC-DIPOLE TRANSITIONS IN

TL I AND PB II

Reduced matrix elements of the electric-quadrupole (E2) and magnetic-dipole (M1) op-

erators in lowest, second, third, and all orders of perturbation theory in Tl I and Pb II are

given in Table IX. Detailed descriptions of the calculations of the reduced matrix elements

of the E2 and M1 operators in lowest and second orders of perturbation theory were given

by Safronova et al. [48]. Third-order and all-order calculations are done in the same way as

the calculations of E1 matrix elements. In Table IX, we present E2 and M1 matrix elements

in the Z (1), Z (2), Z (3), and Z (SD) approximations for 6p1/2 − 6p3/2, 6p1/2 − 7p3/2, 7p1/2 − 6p3/2,

and 7p1/2 −7p3/2 transitions in Tl I and Pb II. These four transitions in Tl I were investigated

for the ﬁrst time by Neuﬀer and Commins [26]. The importance of the Breit contribution

to the calculation of the npj − n′pj′ matrix elements in Tl I was underlined in Ref. [26]. We

found also that the second-order Breit contribution is larger than the Coulomb contribu-

8

tion, which are unusually small for above mentioned E2 and M1 transitions. As a result,

the diﬀerence between Z (1) and Z (2) presented in Table IX is rather small; about 0.3–1%.

The largest Coulomb contribution arises from Bruekner-orbital Z (BO) correction which is

especially large for E2 matrix elements in Tl; the ratio Z (BO)/Z (1) is about 0.13–0.25.

in Tl I and Pb II calculated in the SD approximation are presented in Table X. The SD

data (a) are compared with theoretical calculations given in Refs. [25, 26]. The diﬀerences

between our results and those from [25, 26] for AE2

and AM 1

r

r

can be explained by the

additional correlation correction taken into account in the SD approximation.

VI. HYPERFINE CONSTANTS FOR NEUTRAL THALLIUM

Calculations of hyperﬁne constants follow the same pattern as calculations of reduced

dipole matrix elements described in the previous section. The magnetic moment and nuclear

spin used in the present calculations are taken from [49]. In Tables XI and XII, we give the

magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne constants A for 205Tl and compare them with available theoretical

and experimental data from Refs. [8, 14, 26] and references therein.

Contributions to SD values for the 6pj, 6dj, and 7s1/2 states in 205Tl are given in Table XI

using designations from Refs. [33, 45]. The ﬁrst and last lines of Table XI give Dirac-Fock

and SD values of hyperﬁne constants A(HF) and A(SD), respectively. Values of individual

contributions to the SD matrix elements, Z (a)–Z (t) in the notation of Ref. [45], are also

given in the table. As one can see from Table XI, the largest contribution for 6pj and
7s1/2 states are from Z (a) and Z (c). The term Z (a) contains second- and third-order RPA
contributions and Z (c) contains the part of the third-order Bruekner orbital correction. The

three ﬁrst terms Z (a), Z (b), and Z (c) give more than 90% of the correlation contribution for

6p1/2 and 7s1/2 states.

In Table XII, we list hyperﬁne constants A for 205Tl and compare our values with available

theoretical and experimental data from Refs. [8, 14, 26] and references therein.

In this

table, we present the ﬁrst-order A(DHF) and all-order A(SD) values for the npj with n = 6–9,

ns1/2 with n = 7–9, and 6dj levels. The largest disagreements between our SD data and

experimental values occur for 6p3/2 and 8d5/2 states. As we mentioned previously, the largest

contribution for the 6p3/2 state comes from the second- and third-order RPA contribution

9

and this Z (a) term cancels the lowest-order A(DHF) term. With such cancellation it is diﬃcult

to calculate A(6p3/2) accurately. The best agreement with experimental measurements is

found for 6p1/2 and 7p1/2 states, 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. For other states (7s1/2, 7p3/2,

6dj, 8pj and 9pj) the discrepancies range from 2 to 7%.

VII. CONCLUSION

In summary, a systematic relativistic MBPT study of the energies of 6s2npj (n = 6 − 9),
6s2ns1/2 (n = 7 − 9), 6s2ndj (n = 6 − 8), and 6s2nf5/2 (n = 5 − 6) states in Tl I and Pb II

is presented. The energy values are in good agreement with existing experimental energy

data and provide a theoretical reference database for the line identiﬁcation. A systematic

all-order SD study of reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths, and transition rates for

the 72 possible 6s2nlj − 6s2n′l′
j′ electric-dipole transitions is conducted. Electric-quadrupole
and magnetic-dipole matrix elements are evaluated to calculate lifetime of 6s26p3/2 state.
Hyperﬁne constants are presented for 6s2npj (n = 6 − 9), 6s2ns1/2 (n = 7 − 8), and 6s2ndj
(n = 6 − 8) states in 205Tl isotope. We believe that our energies and transition rates will be

useful in analyzing existing experimental data and in planning future measurements.

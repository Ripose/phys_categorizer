Abstract

The inﬂuence of nuclear polarization on the bound-electron g factor in heavy

hydrogenlike ions is investigated. Numerical calculations are performed for

the K- and L-shell electrons taking into account the dominant virtual nuclear

excitations. This determines the ultimate limit for tests of QED utilizing

measurements of the bound-electron g factor in highly charged ions.

Recent high-precision experiments for measuring the bound-electron g factor in hydro-

genlike carbon have reached a level of accuracy of about 2

10−9 [1,2]. As a consequence,

×

this has led to a new independent determination of the electron mass [3]. Via investigations

of the g factor of a bound electron in a highly charged ion one can probe nontrivial eﬀects

in bound-state QED as sensitive as in high-precision Lamb shift experiments. A further

improvement in accuracy and the extension to systems with higher nuclear charge numbers

Z up to hydrogenlike uranium is intended in the near future [1]. Studies of g factors in

heavy ions are of particular importance, since they can provide a possibility for an indepen-

dent determination of the ﬁne-structure constant [4,5], nuclear magnetic moments [5], and

nuclear charge radii. In order to achieve a level of utmost precision in corresponding theo-

retical calculations, one has to account for the relativistic, higher-order QED, nuclear-size,

nuclear-recoil, and nuclear-polarization corrections [6–14]. Investigations of QED eﬀects in

heavy systems are strongly restricted by the uncertainty due to the ﬁnite nuclear size [8,14].

In Ref. [15], a speciﬁc diﬀerence has been introduced for bound-electron g factors in H- and

Li-like ions, for which the uncertainty due to the nuclear-size eﬀect can be signiﬁcantly re-

duced. With an apparent accuracy of 10−9 for the bound-electron g factor one could probe

higher-order QED corrections even for uranium ions, provided that nuclear polarization

eﬀects remain negligible.

In the present Letter, we evaluate nuclear-polarization corrections to the g factor in

hydrogenlike ions. This reduces the remaining source of uncertainties in the prediction of

nuclear eﬀects. Moreover, we determine the ultimate limit of accuracy for QED tests in

measurements of the bound-electron g factor in highly charged ions.

We consider a hydrogenlike ion with a spinless nucleus, which is placed in a homogeneous

external magnetic ﬁeld H corresponding to a vector potential A(r) = [H

r]/2. The energy

Due to various QED and nuclear eﬀects, the observed bound-electron g factor deviates from

its Dirac value (4). Here we consider the nuclear-polarization correction ∆gnκ, which is of

particular importance in heavy ions.

The dominant contribution to the nuclear-polarization eﬀect for heavy nuclei arises from

virtual collective nuclear excitations. Three types of collective modes should be taken into

account: (a) rotations of the deformed nuclei; (b) harmonic surface vibrations; and (c) gi-

ant resonances.

In Ref. [17], a relativistic ﬁeld theoretical approach has been developed,

where the nuclear-polarization eﬀects are treated perturbatively, incorporating the many-

body theory for virtual nuclear excitations within bound-state QED for atomic electrons.

The contribution of the nuclear vector current can be omitted, because the velocities asso-

ciated with collective nuclear dynamics are nonrelativistic [18]. Accordingly, one is left with

the longitudinal component of the eﬀective photon propagator D00 only due to the nuclear

transition density-correlation function. In Coulomb gauge, it can be represented in terms of

a multipole decomposition as follows [17]

for monopole excitations, respectively. Here R0 is an average radius assigned to the nucleus

in its ground state. The presence of Θ-functions in the expressions (7) and (8) reﬂects

the sharp surface approximation for collective excitations. The form (6) of the propagator

is convenient for numerical evaluations, since the parameters characterizing the nuclear

dynamics ωL and B(EL) can be taken from experiment. Nuclear-polarization corrections

to the Lamb shift (see graph on Fig. 1(b)) have been calculated in Refs. [17–20].

The nuclear-polarization contribution to the bound-electron g factor appears as the

lowest-order nuclear-polarization correction to the diagram 1(a). To ﬁrst order in VH, this

perturbation gives rise to a modiﬁcation of the wave function, of the binding energy, and of

the electron propagator. The corresponding contributions are referred to as the irreducible

part, the reducible part, and the vertex part, respectively. The nuclear-polarization en-

ergy shift of the state under consideration may be represented by the diagrams depicted in

value l + l1 + L has to be even. A second condition in Eq. (21) is that the sum l1 + l2 should

be even as well. The total nuclear-polarization contribution to the g factor is determined

by the sum of all contributions given by Eqs. (16), (18), (20), and (21).

We have evaluated the nuclear-polarization correction to the g factor taking into account

a ﬁnite set of dominant collective nuclear excitations (see Table I). For low-lying rotational

and vibrational levels, the corresponding nuclear parameters, ωL and B(EL), have been

taken from experiments on nuclear Coulomb excitation.

In our estimates for the contri-

butions due to giant resonances, we utilized phenomenological energy-weighted sum rules

[20,23]. The latter are assumed to be concentrated in single resonant states. In the present

calculations, contributions due to monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and octupole giant reso-

nances have been taken into account. To evaluate the inﬁnite summations over the entire

Dirac spectrum, the ﬁnite basis set method has been employed. Basis functions have been

generated via B splines including nuclear-size eﬀects [24]. The major contribution to the

∆gnκ results from the correction to the wave function (16). This is due to the fact that the

matrix element of the atomic magnetic-moment operator is saturated over the scale of atomic

distances, while the inﬂuence of nuclear-polarization is essential in the vicinity of nucleus

only. In the irreducible term, atomic and nuclear scales come into play simultaneously.

According to our numerical results, we conclude that introducing a speciﬁc diﬀerence of

g factors of H- and Li-like heavy ions [15] does not eliminate all the nuclear eﬀects. The

inﬂuence of intrinsic nuclear dynamics becomes noticable at a level of accuracy of about

10−9 for nuclei in the medium Z-range and increases up to 10−6 in uranium. Since nuclear-

7

polarization eﬀects set a natural limit up to which bound-state QED can be tested, one is

faced here with a situation similar to the one in Lamb shift experiments. However, within

the expected accuracy of 10−9 in g-factor experiments with heavy highly charged ions one

may provide a tool for probing internal nuclear structure and for testing speciﬁc nuclear

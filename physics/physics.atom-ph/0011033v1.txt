We investigate hitherto unexplored regimes of probe scat-
tering by atoms trapped in optical lattices: weak scattering by
eﬀectively random atomic density distributions and multiple
scattering by arbitrary atomic distributions. Both regimes are
predicted to exhibit a universal semicircular scattering line-
shape for large density ﬂuctuations, which depend on temper-
ature and quantum statistics.

PACS numbers: 32.80.Pj, 05.40.-a, 42.50.Lc, 71.23.-k

Recent advances in trapping and manipulation of cold
atoms interacting with external ﬁelds have primarily
been implemented thus far either in single-atom systems,
such as sparse (low-density) optical lattices [1], or in
Bose-Einstein condensates with macroscopic numbers of
atoms [2].

Between these two limiting regimes lies the scarcely in-
vestigated domain of processes involving a ﬁnite number
of interacting atoms. Both the potential interest and the
diﬃculties involved in studying

such processes are evident in the example of optical

lattices with appreciable atomic ﬁlling factors [3], in

which the transition between ”insulating” (localized)
and ”metallic” (superﬂuid) phases have been studied in
the framework of the Bose-Hubbard model [4]. As con-
ﬁrmed by the above study, the mean-ﬁeld approximation
is inadequate for small numbers of interacting atoms in
lattices due to the presence of large quantum ﬂuctua-
tions. Still more diﬃcult is the analysis of ﬂuctuations
in systems of cold atoms coupled by long-range (1/r or
1/r3) ﬁeld-induced interactions [5]. This leads to the
intruiging question:
Is there a way to circumvent the
formidable task of treating the full dynamics of such
systems and still infer their important characteristics,
e.g., their dependence on temperature, quantum statis-
tics (Bose or Fermi), number of atoms and lattice pa-
rameters? And: Are there universal measurable features
which can be a ”signature” of the statistical ensemble
(distribution function) of such systems?

Here we consider the possibility of inferring such sta-
tistical characteristics from the spectral features of probe
photons or particles that are scattered by the density
ﬂuctuations of trapped atoms, notably in optical lat-
tices, in two hitherto unexplored scenarios: (a) The probe
is weakly (perturbatively) scattered by the local atomic
density corresponding to the random occupancy of dif-

ferent lattice sites (Fig. 1 - inset a). (b) The probe is
multiply scattered by an arbitrary (possibly unknown a
priori) multi-atom distribution in the lattice (Fig. 1 - in-
set b).

At the heart of our analysis is the idea that the Green
function of the scattered photon or particle, which em-
bodies the relevant spectral information, can be qualita-
tively estimated without resorting to cumbersome pertur-
bative calculations of the probe-multiatom interaction by
replacing this interaction Hamiltonian by an equivalent
random matrix. The random matrix approach, which
has been successfully applied to various disordered sys-
tems [6], allows the evaluation of probe spectra

to all orders of scattering, expressing them by means of
only the ﬁrst two moments (the mean and variance) of the
random interaction, averaged over the statistical ensem-
ble of the multiatom system. The highlight of our anal-
ysis, based on this random matrix approach, is the pre-
diction of a semicircular spectral lineshape of the probe
scattering in the large-ﬂuctuation limit of trapped atomic
ensembles. Thus far, the only known case of quasi-
semicircular lineshapes in optical scattering has been pre-
dicted [7] and experimentally veriﬁed [8] in dielectric mi-
crospheres with randomly distributed internal scatterers.
The Green function of the probe (P) at energy ǫ = ¯hω

is given by

GP (ǫ) = TrS (cid:20)

1
ǫ − ˆHP − ˆV

,

ˆρS(cid:21)

(1)

where ˆHP , ˆV and ˆρS are, respectively,

the unperturbed probe Hamiltonian, the probe-system
interaction Hamiltonian and the density operator for the
ensemble of the multiatom system (S). We shall assume
that the following conditions hold. (i) There is no appre-
ciable back-eﬀect of the probe on the multiatom system
(otherwise it is no longer a probe). (ii) The state of the
multiatom system does not change during the interaction
time with the probe, i.e., the multiatom system remains
”frozen”, as is applicable for optical or atomic probing.
This situation then cannot be described as Markovian re-
laxation (exponential decay) of the probe state into the
multiatom reservoir, since the correlation time of this
reservoir is now much longer than that of the probe, in
contrast with the basic assumption

of relaxation. (iii) The probe spectrum is broadband,

i.e., it encompasses many of its eigenstates.

For an ensemble ”frozen” during the interaction time,
the tracing in (1) implies statistical averaging over re-
peated realizations of the multiatom system, every time
the probe scattering is recorded, or taking the expec-
tation value with respect to the quantum state of the
system. For simplicity, let us explicitly consider elastic
scattering (the extension

to inelastic scattering is straightforward), for which

Raman and single-photon scattering, respectively. For
atom or neutron probes the coupling (2a) is appropriate.

The diﬃculty of having to evaluate or measure the ma-
trix elements S~k~k
′ is avoided for a spatially random den-
sity distribution of the atomic system, due to random
site occupancy (Fig. 1, inset a) and short-range interac-
tion with the probe (e.g., a neutron or thermal atom).
The elements S~k~k
′ in (4) and (5) can then be replaced by
the average of the structure factor over all relevant ~k:

The implications of evaluating the probe DOS g(ǫ)
using (3)-(6) will be examined for random ﬂuctuations
about a mean scattering potential hVS(x)i (correspond-
ing to the mean atomic density distribution) that is 1D-
periodic. The ”unperturbed” probe dispersion associated
with hVS(x)i is ǫ~k = −2J cos(kxd) + A, J being the hop-
ping frequency, d the lattice period and A the band en-
ergy oﬀset. This gives rise to the following expression for
the Green function (3)

In order to extract information on the system we shall
make two simplifying assumptions regarding the probe
and the coupling potential (2): (i) f~k is ﬂat in ~k (the
coupling is strongly localized in space) within a band
exceeding the relevant band of the system, so that f~k ≈ f ;
(ii) the statistical distribution of the probe is also ﬂat in
~k and its second moment in h ˆV 2i is replacable by the
square of its mean ﬂux (or density) ¯n2
P for the bilinear
coupling (2a) or by its mean ﬂux (density) ¯nP for the
linear coupling (2b). Under these assumptions we can
rewrite the squared coupling potential in (3) as

respectively. The quantity of interest for the system
is the Fourier-transformed density-density correlation of
the atomic system

Here hW 2i ≡ FP ¯S, Λ(ǫ) = hW 2i/
(ǫ − A)2 − 4J 2 for
|ǫ−A| > 2J, ∆(ǫ) = hW 2i/
4J 2 − (ǫ − A)2 for |ǫ−A| <
2J and both zero otherwise. Figure 1 shows how the
p
probe DOS g(ǫ) changes from that of a periodic band
structure corresponding to the mean potential hVS(x)i
to a semicircular shape as the amount of ﬂuctuations
measured by hW 2i increases.

p

In the multiple-scattering scenario,
which pertains to resonantly scattered atomic probes
or to intracavity optical probes (Fig. 1, inset b), semicir-
cular lineshapes are

obtained even when the S~k~k

′ cannot be claimed to be-

long to a random distribution (Fig. 2, inset).

In the case of strongly-interacting atoms within a lat-
tice site or longe-range intersite density correlations [5]
the distribution may be quite intricate, corresponding to
sharp peaks of S~k~k
′ . Nevertheless, the universal spectral
trends of Fig. 1 can be shown

to hold in this scenario, provided h ˆV 2i1/2g0(ǫ) ≫ 1,
g0(ǫ) denoting the ”unperturbed” probe DOS. This con-
dition allows us to estimate G~k~k in (3) to all orders in ˆV ,
upon replacing the state of the atomic system by a gaus-
sian random ensemble [6,7]. The result is the following

universal formula [7] for the renormalized probe energy ˜ǫ
at a given input energy ǫ

ǫ = ˜ǫ + hW 2iTrP (cid:18)

˜ǫ − ˆHP − i0 (cid:19)

The use of (8) leads to a semicircular lineshape similar
to the one in Fig. 1, as if the potential were random.

In order to illustrate the role of temperature, quantum
statistics and the mean lattice potential in producing the
semicircular lineshape, we proceed to evaluate hW 2i for
several simple models:
1. The isolated-site limit: The tightly-bound Bose or
Fermi distributions in a lattice can be estimated by tak-
ing the potential of each site to be that of a harmonic
well of depth V0. The isolated-site approximation holds
for atoms in the lowest vibrational band, when the cou-
pling energy is much smaller than the excitation energy

Λ(ǫ) (dispersion), see text. All curves are numerically com-

In the absence of additional external perturbations, the
coupling hW 2i arises because of temperature-dependent
ﬂuctuations in the site-occupancy of the optical lattice,
which has an approximately gaussian distribution [3].
The resulting random coupling energies averaged over
all states yield hW 2i ∼ FP

c~k, i and j label atomic sites, and hnSi is the

average number of atoms per site. The last step applies
whenever ni ≈ nj ∀i, j and the density ﬂuctuations are
approximately site-independent. We have veriﬁed this by
numerical simulation, considering 2 to 4 identical atoms
on a 1D lattice with 6 sites and calculating the density
ﬂuctuations if the probability of an occupied site is 1/10

of the probability of an empty site. In all cases the max-
′ and hW 2i was
imum relative diﬀerence between FP S~k~k
less than 10 %.

The kinetic contribution to hW 2i due to evaporation
of atoms from the lattice is the dominant one at high
temperatures, regardless of the statistics. If all the atoms
are in the lowest energy band, we may adopt the rate
equation used to describe the formation of electron-hole
clusters in a plasma [10] and ﬁnd

hW 2ievap = a hnSi T 2 e−βV0.

(9)

Here a = kBmcp, with kB the Boltzmann constant, m the
mass of the atoms and cp their speciﬁc heat, T denotes
the temperature, β−1 ≡ kBT and V0 is the optical lat-
tice potential. The inﬂuence of evaporation becomes the
dominant eﬀect for T ∼ 25 µK. Around T ∼ 300 µK these
ﬂuctuations become comparable in size to the square of
the optical lattice potential (hW 2i ∼ V 2
0 ∼ 100 (neV)2)
and atoms then largely escape from the lattice.

At low temperatures (well below 100 µK) the density-
density ﬂuctuations depend on whether the atoms in the
lattice are bosons or fermions. For bosonic atoms in the
lowest vibrational state we obtain [11]

Here we have approximated the motion of the atoms in

tice spacing and λT = (2π¯h2/mkBT ), the thermal wave-
length, is the length scale separating quantum statistical
behavior (for λT ∼ d) from classical Maxwell-Boltzmann
behavior (for λT ≪ d). For fermionic atoms in an optical
lattice [13] one starts with the analog of the coupling (2)
for particles

with spin, using creation and annihilation operators

with λF the Fermi wavelength. At high temperatures
z → 0 and both (10) and (11) reduce to the classi-
cal Maxwell-Boltzmann result hW 2istat,clas = z. At low
temperatures, fermionic ﬂuctuations approach a constant
value, whereas bosonic ﬂuctuations become very large as
T decreases below ∼ 1µK, marking the Bose-Einstein
condensation.

In Fig. 2 we have taken typical parameters for avail-
able optical lattices to show how hW 2i evolves as a func-
tion of temperature both for bosons (Cs atoms) and for

fermions (Li atoms). The total density-density ﬂuctua-
tions consist of the sum of (9) and either (10) or (11),
depending on the statistics. Note that since Li atoms
are lighter than Cs atoms, their ﬂuctuations are larger.
The isolated-site condition is satisfed for the entire tem-
perature range displayed in Fig. 2. Since the hopping
frequency J ∼ V0, the random coupling changes from
hW 2i/J 2 ∼ 0.1 to hW 2i/J 2 ∼ 10, when going from
T ∼ 8 µK to T ∼ 100 µK. Simultaneously the DOS then
evolves from the periodic to the semicircular shape as in
Fig. 1.

tor, φ~κ is the corresponding Fourier harmonic of the lat-

~G δ(~κ + ~q + ~G)], where hn~qi
1)
is the mean number of phonons at temperature T with
P
wavevector ~q, and ~G denotes the reciprocal lattice vector.
The phonon mode spectrum includes quasi-local modes
in the case of ﬂuctuating atomic distributions. This nat-
urally leads to the limit (6) and an eﬀectively random
coupling (Fig. 2, inset - solid line).

To conclude, we have identiﬁed novel regimes of probe
scattering by atoms trapped in optical lattices in the
random-density and multiple-scattering regimes. These
regimes cannot be treated by the mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mation, but are characterized by a universal feature of
large density ﬂuctuations, namely, semicircular scatter-
ing lineshapes. This is the atom-optical analog of the
semicircular broadening of the DOS in disordered elec-
tronic systems, which as far as we know has not yet
been observed unambiguously. The observation of this
atom-optical counterpart presents a nontrivial but feasi-
ble challenge for experimentalists.

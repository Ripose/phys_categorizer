The important role of symmetry in nature is well known. A number of laws (or
constraints) based on symmetry have been discovered, they govern the evolution of
basic physical processes in nature [1-5]. In quantum mechanical systems, owing to
the invariance of the Hamiltonian with respect to symmetric operations (rotation,
space inversion, particle permutation, etc.), the eigenstates are classiﬁed according
to a set of quantum numbers , these numbers specify the transformation property
of the wavefunctions under symmetric operations. Since an eigenstate must have
a speciﬁc transformation property, the distribution of wavefunctions in coordinate
space may be greatly constrained.
It was found in [6-8] that the constraint is
embodied by the existence of a special type of nodal surfaces, the so called inherent
nodal surface (INS). In this paper, we shall demonstrate how the INS aﬀect the
spatial distributions of the wavefunctions of 4-electron atoms, and how the low-
lying spectrum is thereby decisively aﬀected.

Let us ﬁrst study the origin of the INS in a general way. Let A be a point in
a multi-dimensional coordinate space. Evidently, A is associated with a geometric
conﬁguration. Let Oi be a combined symmetric operation. In some cases, one may
ﬁnd a set of Oi (i =1 to m) to leave A invariant; i.e., OiA = A (For example,
is the case of a 4-body system an equilateral tetrahedron conﬁguration (ETH) is
invariant to the rotation about a 2-fold axis together with two interchanges of the
particles, refer to Fig.1). Let Ψ be an eigenstate. Let ˆOi be the operator acting on
Ψ so that ˆOiΨ(A) = Ψ(OiA). When A is invariant to Oi , we have

ˆOiΨ(A) = Ψ(A).

(i = 1 to m)

(1)

Owing to the inherent transformation property of Ψ, eq.(1) always can be written
in matrix forms (as we shall see). In this form we have m sets of homogeneous
linear algebra equations. These equations impose a very strong constraint on Ψ.
Since a set of homogeneous equations does not always have non-zero solutions, in
some cases Ψ must be zero at A. This is the origin of the INS. In the follows we
shall concern mainly the 4-electron atomic systems, however the generalization to
other quantum systems is straight forward.

An important geometric conﬁguration with the strongest geometric symmetry
for the 4-body systems is the equilateral tetrahedron (ETH). Let pij denotes an
interchange of i and j. Let k’ be a 2-fold axis of an ETH so that a rotation of the
ETH about k’ is equivalent to p12p34. Let i’ be an axis originating from the nucleus
→ri is the position vector of the i-th
→r1, where
vertical to k’ and parallel to
electron originating from the nucleus.
δ be an operator of rotation about
the n-axis by δ (in degree), let P be the operator of a space inversion. One can
prove that the ETH is invariant to

The three sets of equations as a whole depend on and only on L, Π, and λ(or
S). If there is one (or more than one) set(s) of non-zero F LΠλ
(ET H) (not all of
them are zero) fulﬁlling all the three sets of equations, then we say that Ψ can
access the ETH. Otherwise, Ψ is zero at any ETH conﬁguration disregarding the
size and orientation of the ETH. In this case an INS emerges, and the ETH can not
be accessed. At an ETH, when Ψ is non-zero, from (5) and (6) it can in general be
written as

Where the coeﬃcient bLΠλ

(ET H). Their values are
obtained by solving the equations (7a) to (7c), thus depend on L,Π, and λ but
absolutely not aﬀected by dynamics, therefore they are model-independent. Only
the coeﬃcient C as a common constant is left to be determined by dynamics. This
fact reveals the decisive eﬀect of symmetry on the eigenwavefunctions. Evidently,
our discussion is quite global and not only conﬁned in atomic systems. Owing
to (7c), diﬀerent Q-components are mixed up in (9). Therefore, for the states
dominated by ETH-structure (the wavefunction is mainly distributed around an
ETH), Q is far from an approximately conserved quantum number.

It is noted that when an ETH is deformed, the geometric symmetry becomes
weaker, accordingly the constraints becomes fewer. For example, when an ETH is
prolonged along one of its 2-fold axis, say, along k’, the prolonged-ETH is invariant
to Oa and Ob , but not Oc. Thus, instead of three sets of equations, the wavefunction
at a prolonged-ETH fulﬁlls only (7.a) and (7.b), but not (7.c). For some cases of
L,Π, and λ , it was found that not only the common non-zero solutions of (7a) to
(7c) do not exist, but also the common non-zero solutions of only (7a) and (7b) do
not exist. In this case the INS located at the ETH will extend to the prolonged-
ETH. Since an ETH has many ways to deform, the INS located at the ETH has
many possibilities to extend. This fact implies that the ETH may be a source
where the INS emerges and extend to its neighborhood. In other words, in a broad
region surrounding the ETH, speciﬁc inherent nodal structures may pour out from
the source at the ETH. Accordingly, the wavefunctions in this broad domain would
be seriously aﬀected. Nonetheless, once a wavefunction can access the ETH, it
deﬁnitely can access the neighborhood of the ETH, therefore an ETH-accessible
wavefunction is inherent-nodeless in the broad domain surrounding the ETH.

Another possible source of INS is located at the coplanar squares ( the four
electrons form a square and are coplanar with the nucleus). Let k’ be normal
to the plane of the square, let electrons 1 and 2 be located at the two ends of a
→r1 as before. Then the coplanar square is
diagonal, and let i’ be parallel to
invariant to

Thus the F LΠλ
are also constrained at the coplanar squares by three sets of equa-
tions, thereby the accessibility of the coplanar squares can be identiﬁed. As before,
the accessibility depends on L,Π, and λ (or S). It is noted that the rotation oper-
ators in eq.(10) do not mix up the F LΠλ
Q′i with |Q| 6= |Q′|, but only those
with the same |Q| (refer to (10c)). Therefore, at a coplanar square, an eigenwave-
function can be in general written as

For a given |Q|, non-zero solutions of eq.(10) may not exist; in this case we have
Ψ|Q| = 0. Alternatively, for a given |Q|, if a non-zero solution exists, the eq.(10)
as homogeneous equations can determine only the dLΠλ
|Q|,i , but not the C|Q|. When
more than one non-zero Ψ|Q| are contained in Ψ(coplanar − square), the C|Q| of
them are all determined by dynamics. In this case, these non-zero coeﬃcients C|Q|
may be optimized to lower the energy.

For the intrashell states (in these states the 4-valence-electron stay in the same
shell), obviously if the electrons form an ETH the Coulomb repulsion will be min-
imized. The other favourable conﬁguration is just the coplanar square (in some
cases the coplanar square is even better than the ETH, because the moment of
inertia of a coplanar square may be larger resulting in having a smaller collective
rotation energy Erot). In general, the wavefunctions of all the low-lying states are
mainly distributed in the domains where the total potential energy is relatively
lower. Therefore, the domains surrounding the ETH and the coplanar squares are
very important to the low-lying states, and the accessibility of these two domains
will be crucial to the low-lying spectrum. Since the search of solutions of homoge-
neous linear equations is trivial, we shall neglect the details but give directly the
accessibility in Table 1.

From Table 1 the 2S+1LΠ states can be classiﬁed into three types as listed in the
ﬁrst column of Table 2. The ﬁrst type can access both the ETH and the coplanar
squares, these states are essentially inherent nodeless. The second type contains an
INS located either at the ETH or at the coplanar squares. The third type contains
INS both at the ETH and at the coplanar squares. Let an eigenenergy be divided
as a sum of the internal energy Eint and the collective rotation energy Erot. Let the
lowest state of a 2S+1LΠ series be called a ﬁrst-state. Evidently, the more the nodal
surfaces are contained, the higher the energy. As a ﬁrst-state, it will contain the
nodal surfaces as least as possible. If they contain any nodal surface, it was found
in [6] that they would contain only the INS. Thus, we predict that the Eint of the
ﬁrst-states of the ﬁrst type should be the lowest, in these states the wavefunction
can be freely distributed in the most important domains without nodal surfaces,
and therefore can be optimized to lower the energy. On the other hand, the Eint of
the ﬁrst-states of the third type should be considerably higher due to containing
more nodal surfaces.

From the classiﬁcation, the low-lying spectrum can be predicted as follows. For

L=0 states, the 1Se and 5So states would be the lowest two (because they belong
to the second type, while the other L=0 states belong to the third type). For L=1
states, the 3P e of the ﬁrst type would be the lowest, the 3P o of the second type
would be the second lowest. For L=2 states, the 1De and 3Do of the ﬁrst type would
be the lowest two. It is noted that the wavefunctions of a Coulombic system are
usually broadly distributed in the coordinate space due to the long-range character
of the Coulomb force. It is also noted that the domain of the ETH and the domain
of the coplanar square are closely connected (e.g., when an ETH is ﬂattened along
one of its 2-fold axis, it will become to a coplanar square). Therefore the wave
functions of the ﬁrst-state of the ﬁrst type are expected to be smoothly distributed
in both domains. This presumption was actually found in [9] (refer to Fig. 6a of
[9]).

Qi

It is noted that in general the orientation of a coplanar structure (relative to
L) is crucial to Erot. When the normal of the coplanar structure k’ is parallel to L,
the moment of inertia is larger ,and therefore Erot is smaller. Consequently, when
a coplanar structure exists in a F LΠλ
component, the larger the |Q|, the smaller
the Erot. For the 3Do state, a coplanar square can exist only in |Q|=1 component
(cf. Table 1). However, for the 1De state, the coplanar square can exist both in
|Q| = 2 and 0 components. It is noted that a ﬁrst-state will do its best to lower
the energy. Thus the 1De ﬁrst-state will be dominated by the |Q|=2 component
to reduce the Erot. For this reason, although both the 1De and 3Do would have
favourable internal structure, we predict that the 1De would be lower than the 3Do
due to having a smaller Erot. The second lowest two L=2 states would be the 1Do
and 5De of the second type. For L=3 states, all the 3F e, 5F e and 3F o belong to
the ﬁrst type. However, the coplanar square can exist in |Q| = 3 component in
3F o, exists only in |Q| = 2 component in 5F e and exists only in Q=0 component
in 3F e. Thus we predict that the 3F o is the lowest, the 5F e is the second lowest,
while the 3F e is the third lowest. The 1F e is the fourth lowest due to belonging to
the second type.

In particular, since the internal structure of the ﬁrst-states of the ﬁrst type
is most favorable, since among all the states of the ﬁrst type the 3P e is the one
having the smallest L (therefore the smallest Erot), thus we predict that the 3P e
is the ground state. The prediction on the ordering of the ﬁrst-states with their
quantum numbers is given in Table 2. For the second-states, they are more energetic
and therefore can access a much broader region, including the region with a higher
total potential energy. Besides the INS, they will contain additional nodal surfaces
because they have to be orthogonal to the ﬁrst-states. We shall not discuss them
in this paper.

From the above analysis, the ﬁrst-states of the same type would have sim-
ilar internal structures, the energy diﬀerences between them arise mainly from
Erot. Thus, rotation bands would exist in the spectrum, this is an important fea-
ture. The ﬁrst-states of the ﬁrst type including the 3P e,1 De,3 Do,3 F o,5 F e,3 F e, · · ··
would form a band headed by the ground state 3P e, therefore this band may be
called the ground-band. The internal wavefunctions F LΠλ
of this band are broadly

Qi

and smoothly distributed around the ETH and the coplanar squares without nodal
surface. The ﬁrst-states of the second type will form two bands. One is com-
posed of the coplanar square-accessible but ETH-inaccessible states including the
1Se,3 P o,5 De,1 F e, · · ·. For these states, there is a source of INS located at the
ETH. Therefore their wave functions may prefer coplanar structure to avoid the
INS, they are expected to be distributed smoothly around a coplanar square. This
band may be called the coplanar square-band. The other band is composed of the
ETH-accessible but coplanar square-inaccessible states including the 5So, 1Do, · · · · .
Their wave functions are expected to be distributed around the ETH. For these
states, the INS at the coplanar square will spoil the stability of the ETH. In fact, a
speciﬁc mode of internal oscillation induced by the INS was found in [10]. There-
fore, this band may be called the ETH*-band, where the * implies that an internal
oscillation with one node is inhering. There may be other higher bands, e.g., com-
posed of the ﬁrst-states of the third type. However, the above three bands are the
most important bands, we shall not discuss the other possible higher bands in this
paper.

At present both the experimental and theoretical results are not suﬃcient to
check all the above predictions. Nonetheless, the data derived from an analysis of
the experimental optical spectra by Moore [11] are very valuable, which are listed
in Table 3 for the n=2 intrashell states of diﬀerent species. Not all the 2S+1LΠ
symmetries are allowed for a given shell (due to the limitation in the partial wave
of individual electron and due to the Pauli Principle). However, the optical data
for all the allowed n=2 intrashell states are complete in the case of the ion O++.
These data conﬁrm the predictions very well . The ordering of levels is exactly
as predicted without an exception. Furthermore, experimentally the ground states
of all the 4-valence-electron systems are a 3P e state just as predicted without an
exception. Nonetheless, since the existing data are not complete, more data on
quadruply excited states (in particular those for intrashell states with a larger n)
are needed to justify the predictions.

Owing to the diﬃculty in calculation, the theoretical literatures on the quadru-
ply excited states are very few. In 1994 Komninos and Nicolaides have calculated
the intrashell quadruply excited 5So states of Be atom by using the multiconﬁgu-
rational Hartree-Fock method [12]. They found that in the ﬁrst-states of the 5So
symmetry, the angle between the two position vectors of any two valence electrons
tends to 106◦. On the other hand, the angle is 109.4◦ for an ETH. Thus their
ﬁnding supports that the 5So states are dominated by the ETH-structure.
In a
calculation based on a r-frozen model [10] the ETH-structure of the 5So states was
also found. Besides, the expected INS existing at coplanar squares was conﬁrmed
in [10] (refer to Fig.6a of [10]).

In fact, the distribution of a wavefunction in coordinate space is determined
by two factors, namely the total potential energy and the inherent nodal struc-
ture. Since the ﬁrst factor is easier to be recognized, the second factor is crucial.
In this paper, the decisive eﬀect of the inherent nodal structure has been demon-
strated, a primary classiﬁcation scheme has been proposed, thereby the low-lying

spectrum can be systematically understood. Owing to the rapid progress in exper-
imental techniques, much more data on the quadruply excited states is expected
to be coming. The qualitative knowledge derived in this paper will be helpful to
understand the coming data.

The generalization of the above procedure to any few-body system is straight
forward. In any case, the sources of INS should be identiﬁed, a classiﬁcation scheme
can be established based on the understanding of the inherent nodal structure. The
existence of the inherent nodal structure is a great marvel of quantum mechanics.
Since diﬀerent systems are constrained by symmetry in a similar way, similarity
should exist and we can understand them via an uniﬁed point of view.

The collinear eZe conﬁguration of helium, with the electrons on opposite sides of the nucleus, is
studied in the presence of an external electromagnetic (laser or microwave) ﬁeld. We show that the
classically unstable “asymmetric stretch” orbit, on which doubly excited intrashell states of helium
with maximum interelectronic angle are anchored, can be stabilized by means of a resonant driving
where the frequency of the electromagnetic ﬁeld equals the frequency of Kepler-like oscillations along
the orbit. A static magnetic ﬁeld, oriented parallel to the oscillating electric ﬁeld of the driving,
can be used to enforce the stability of the conﬁguration with respect to deviations from collinearity.
Quantum Floquet calculations within a collinear model of the driven two-electron atom reveal the
existence of nondispersive wave packets localized on the stabilized asymmetric stretch orbit, for
double excitations corresponding to principal quantum numbers of the order of N >

∼ 10.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The correlated dynamics of two-electron atoms under
external electromagnetic driving represents a fascinating
topic of atomic physics. The outstanding example in this
context is double ionization of helium in the presence of a
strong laser pulse. At not too high intensities of the laser
(near 1015 W/cm2 [1, 2]), the electrons are, contrary to
natural expectation, not emitted in a sequential process
– which was clearly manifest in the original experiments
[1, 2]. Further experimental investigations (e.g., [3, 4,
5]) and a number of theoretical studies (e.g., [6, 7, 8,
9, 10]) have revealed that a nontrivial multistep process
is responsible for nonsequential double ionization in this
intensity regime, involving tunnel ionization of one of the
electrons, recollision of this outer electron with the ionic
core, followed by subsequent excitation and ionization of
the inner electron.

In the regime of highly excited states, complex dy-
namics can also take place in the presence of moderate
electromagnetic ﬁelds, which are not strong enough to
fully ionize the atom, but substantially perturb the elec-
tronic motion. A striking example in this context is the
occurence of nondispersive wave packets in microwave-
driven hydrogen: Rydberg wave packets, which are nor-
mally subject to spreading and collapse after a limited
number of Kepler cycles, can be stabilized and “kept in
shape” over a practically arbitrary amount of time by
means of a resonant electrical driving (with linear [11, 12]
or circular polarization [13, 14, 15]). This ﬁeld needs to
be phase-matched with the wave packet in such a way
that components associated with deviating classical tra-
jectories are driven back to the resonant Kepler orbit.
For a wave packet that performs parabolic-state-like os-
cillations along the axis of a linearly polarized ﬁeld for
instance [11, 12], this means that the external force on
the electron needs to be directed towards the nucleus at
the outer turning point of the classical motion, and away
from it at the inner turning point (i.e., when the elec-

tron collides with the nucleus). The wave packet then
corresponds to a Floquet eigenstate of the periodically
driven system, which is localized in phase space on the
regular island that is associated with the above nonlin-
ear resonance. The coupling to the “chaotic sea” outside
the island, and subsequently also to the ionization con-
tinuum, is mediated via a classically forbidden tunneling
process through the dynamical phase space barriers of
the island, what leads to almost “eternal” lifetimes of
such wave packets [11, 12, 14].

The concept of nondispersive wave packets, which is of
potential interest in the context of quantum control, can
be generalized to the correlated dynamics in two-electron
atoms. This was indeed shown for the classically stable
“frozen planet” conﬁguration of helium [16, 17], where
both electrons are located on the same side of the nu-
cleus with asymmetric excitation. The application of a
linearly polarized microwave perturbation to this conﬁg-
uration induces analogous islands of regular motion in
phase space, which arise here from a resonant driving of
the outer electron [18, 19]. A static electric ﬁeld, how-
ever, is needed to ensure classical stability with respect
to deviations from collinearity. The existence of nondis-
persive two-electron wave packets localized on these res-
onance islands has indeed been revealed in Floquet cal-
culations within a quantum model that represents the
analog of the collinear two-electron conﬁguration [20, 21].
In this contribution, we examine to which extent the
mechanism that leads to nondispersive wave packets can
be used to stabilize a doubly excited conﬁguration – i.e.,
to enhance the lifetime of the associated autoionizing
states by increasing the amplitude of the external elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. Originally, the phenomenon of sta-
bilization was discussed in the context of one-electron
atoms in ultra-intense high-frequency laser ﬁelds (“adi-
abatic stabilization”), where it was shown that the ion-
ization rate of the atom decreases with increasing laser
intensity [22] (without, however, taking into account rel-
ativistic eﬀects; see [23]). The eﬀect that we are aiming

at is more of intermediate nature (i.e., it manifests itself
at moderate intensities of the electromagnetic ﬁeld) and
relies on the structure of the underlying classical phase
space. The basic question is to which extent the driving
ﬁeld can create dynamical phase space barriers (invari-
ant tori) around a periodic orbit that would be unstable
without the external perturbation. Floquet eigenstates
that are locally quantized on this stabilized orbit are then
semiclassically protected against decay, which enhances
their lifetime compared to the unperturbed atom.

A natural candidate for this stabilization mechanism
is the “asymmetric stretch” orbit [24]. In this orbit, the
electrons are located on opposite sides of the nucleus and
perform slightly perturbed Kepler oscillations with oppo-
site phase; whenever one of the electrons hits the nucleus,
the other one reaches the outer turning point of the orbit.
The dynamics along this orbit is stable with respect to
transverse bending perturbations, but unstable against
deviations in axial direction. As was shown by Richter
and Wintgen [25], intrashell resonances with maximum
interelectronic angle are predominantly scarred along this
orbit – which can be seen as a consequence of the promi-
nent role that this orbit plays in the semiclassical quan-
tization of helium [24].

Due to the phase shift between the Kepler-like oscilla-
tions, the stabilization mechanism that was used to cre-
ate nondispersive wave packets in driven hydrogen can
now be applied simultaneously to both electrons: We ex-
pose the collinear conﬁguration to a coaxially polarized
electromagnetic ﬁeld the force of which is directed to-
wards the nucleus at the outer turning point of each
electron, and outwards when the electron collides with
the nucleus. Indeed, we shall see in Section II that the
asymmetric stretch orbit can thereby be stabilized within
the phase space of collinear motion, if the amplitude of
the driving ﬁeld is appropriately chosen. In the presence
of the time-periodic driving, the orbit is no longer sta-
ble with respect to deviations from collinearity – due to
mixing of states with diﬀerent angular momentum. We
shall argue in Section III, however, that a static mag-
netic ﬁeld can be used to enforce the transverse stabil-

the basic properties of nondispersive two-electron wave
packets localized on the stabilized asymmetric stretch or-
bit are elaborated using a one-dimensional model that
represents the quantum analog of the collinear eZe con-
ﬁguration. We shall point out that these wave packet
states evolve diabatically from the unperturbed asym-
metric stretch state, and that their lifetimes exhibit a
local maximum at ﬁnite values of the ﬁeld amplitude.

COLLINEAR ASYMMETRIC STRETCH ORBIT

Here, ri = (xi, yi, zi) and pi = (pxi, pyi, pzi) denote the
position and momentum of electron i = 1, 2, respectively,
Z = 2 is the nuclear charge, and F and ω represent
the amplitude and frequency of the external driving ﬁeld
which is linearly polarized along the z axis. In analogy
to driven hydrogen [26] as well as to the unperturbed
helium atom [27], the Hamiltonian (1) exhibits general
scaling laws: The classical dynamics generated by (1)
remains invariant if all variables and parameters of the
system are transformed according to

where ν represents an arbitrary, real positive quantity.
We shall therefore restrict the classical analysis to a ﬁxed
value ω = 1 of the driving frequency, and use the above
scale invariance (2) to deduce the actual dynamics at the
energy range of interest. F0 denotes, in the following,
the value of the “scaled” ﬁeld amplitude F at driving
frequency ω = 1.

In the following, we shall concentrate on the invariant
subspace of collinear motion along the z axis, with the
electrons on opposite sides of the nucleus. Such a collinear
eZe motion is generated by initial conditions of the form
xi(t = 0) = yi(t = 0) = pxi(t = 0) = pyi(t = 0) = 0 for
i = 1, 2, and z1(t = 0) > 0 whereas z2(t = 0) < 0. Due to
the Coulomb singularity in the interaction, the electrons
cannot pass the nucleus at the origin. This implies that
z1(t) > 0 and z2(t) < 0 for all times t > 0.

To ensure a stable numerical integration of the classical
equations of motion, we perform a Kustaanheimo-Stiefel
transformation [28]. This procedure, which is described
in Appendix A for the special case of collinear motion,
introduces new phase space variables which do not di-
verge at electron-nucleus collisions. Triple collisions –
i.e., the simultaneous encounter of both electrons at the
nucleus – cannot be regularized in such a way; they repre-
sent “true” singularities of the dynamics, where diﬀerent
manifolds of trajectories merge together without a well-
deﬁned continuation [29].

Correspondingly,

the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser
(KAM) theorem cannot be applied to this system,
which is reﬂected by the fact that the classical dynamics
in the
of the unperturbed three-body problem (i.e.,
ﬁeld-free case F0 = 0) is fully chaotic, even in the limit
of very weak electron-electron interaction (which would
correspond here to very small 1/Z) [24, 30]. Indeed, it

conﬁguration. Plotted are the coordinates of the two elec-
trons (z1 > 0 and z2 < 0) as a function of time, with the
nucleus resting at z = 0. The scaling (see Eq. (2)) is chosen
such that the frequency of the orbit equals ω = 1.
b) A small change of the initial condition (the “upper” elec-
tron is displaced by ∆z1 = 0.01) leads to an appreciable devi-
ation from the asymmetric stretch orbit (shown in grey in
the background) within a couple of oscillation cycles. At

collision.

is possible to represent each periodic orbit by a unique
sequence of symbols, which is basically determined by
the order in which the electrons hit the nucleus [24].
The simplest orbit with respect to this symbolic code
is the “asymmetric stretch” orbit, shown in Fig. 1(a),
in which the electrons collide with the nucleus in a
perfectly alternating way. Since in this conﬁguration the
electrons avoid a simultaneous encounter at the nucleus
in the best possible way, the stability exponent of this
orbit is rather low compared to other, more complicated
periodic orbits [24].

Nevertheless, a small deviation from the orbit’s ini-
tial condition leads to disintegration of the conﬁgura-
tion on rather short time scales. This is illustrated
in Fig. 1(b), which shows what happens when one of
the electrons is displaced in conﬁguration space by an
amount of ∆z = 0.01: After a few cycles, the Kepler-like
oscillations of the electrons get out of phase, which leads
to a nearby triple collision where a large amount of energy
is transferred between the electrons, and to subsequent
(single) ionization of the atom.

The external time-dependent electric ﬁeld is now ap-
plied to this conﬁguration in order to compensate this
destabilization phenomenon. As in the case of nondisper-
sive wave packets in driven hydrogen, the relative phase
between the ﬁeld and the electronic motion is adjusted
such that the ﬁeld forces the electron towards the nucleus
at the outer turning point of the Kepler-like oscillation,
and away from it at the inner turning point. In this way,
deviations from the periodic orbit are counterbalanced

posite phase, the phase-matching condition can be simul-
taneously satisﬁed for both electrons. For the particular
type of initial condition in Fig. 1, where z1(0) =
z2(0)
and pz1(0) = pz2(0) < 0, we need to choose ϕ = π/2 as
initial ﬁeld phase in Eq. (1).

Due to the high dimensionality of the extended phase
space, which is spanned by the positions and momenta
of the electrons and by the phase of the external driving,
regular islands that result from this stabilization mecha-
nism cannot be visualized by means of Poincar´e surfaces
of section. To identify the periodic orbit at ﬁnite ﬁeld am-
= 0, we employ an iterative procedure which
plitude F0 6
is described in Appendix B. The key ingredient to this
procedure is the fact that initial conditions of asymmetric
stretch orbits at diﬀerent ﬁeld amplitudes F0 and F0+δF0
lie close to each other in phase space – i.e., within each
other’s linear neighbourhood – as long as
is rather
small. Hence, by varying F0 in suﬃciently small steps
and using a Newton-Raphson method to adapt the initial
condition, we can “trace” the periodic orbit as a function
of the ﬁeld amplitude.

Fig. 2 shows the Lyapunov exponent σ = ln λmax of the
driven asymmetric stretch orbit, which is calculated from
the largest eigenvalue λmax of the stability matrix associ-
ated with one oscillation period. In between F0 ≃

0.154, this eigenvalue is smaller than unity,
and F0 ≃
which formally results in a negative Lyapunov exponent
and indicates stable dynamics in the vicinity of the orbit.
This is indeed conﬁrmed by plotting the corresponding
trajectories in conﬁguration space – e.g., for F0 = 0.074
as shown in Fig. 3: Instead of increasing exponentially
with time, a small deviation from the periodic orbit leads
to stable, quasiperiodic oscillations around the orbit.

at which fully localized quantum states are to be expected
on the stabilized asymmetric stretch island.

It should be noted that the above estimation (6) is
fairly imprecise and has to be taken as approximate
guideline for the order of magnitude of Nmin, rather than
as a precise criterion. This is, on the one hand, due to
the simpliﬁcations that are involved in determining the
cross section area of the outermost invariant torus of the
island. On the other hand, the notion of an “outermost”
torus itself is, strictly speaking, not meaningful in ﬁve or
more dimensions, where invariant tori (with codimension
larger than unity) do not divide the phase space in dis-
connected segments. As a consequence, chaotic sublayers
“within” the island are connected with each other and
with the chaotic sea “outside” the island, and trajecto-
ries starting on such sublayers can, via Arnold diﬀusion
[32], leave the island on ﬁnite (though typically rather
long) time scales. This is illustrated in Fig. 6, which
shows the time evolution of a trajectory starting close
to the boundary of the island. After a seemingly stable
quasi-periodic oscillation over more than 80 ﬁeld cycles,
the correlation between the electrons breaks down and
the atom ionizes.

At ﬁnite values of ~, moreover, the presence of Cantori
[33] can inhibit quantum transport also in the immediate
vicinity outside the regular island (where “hierarchical
states” are localized [34]). The eﬀective size of the local-
izing region that the quantum system “sees” may there-
fore be considerably larger than the size of the classical
island. Correspondingly, estimations via the EBK crite-
rion are typically rather conservative and tend to overes-
timate the actual value of the minimum scaling needed
to obtain a localized state on the island (an extreme case
was reported in [35, 36] where quantum states associated
with the “Langmuir” orbit of helium were semiclassically
predicted for N > 500 and quantum mechanically found
at N = 10).
Indeed, we shall see in Section IV that
double excitations with principal quantum numbers of
the order of N
10, which are experimentally accessible
[37, 38], would be suﬃcient to obtain nondispersive wave
packets anchored on the asymmetric stretch orbit.

placed by ∆z1 = 0.2. After a seemingly stable quasi-periodic
oscillation over about 85 ﬁeld cycles, the correlation between
the electrons “suddenly” breaks down. A nearby triple col-
lision transfers then a large amount of energy between the
electrons, which leads to ionization.

III. DEVIATIONS FROM COLLINEARITY

In contrast to deviations within the collinear subspace,
the transverse degrees of freedom do not lead to destabi-
lization of the unperturbed asymmetric stretch orbit. If
both electron are symmetrically displaced in a direction
that is perpendicular to the z axis – e.g., by nonvanishing
initial components y1(t = 0) = y2(t = 0)) – the eﬀective
repulsion between them is enhanced due to the reduced
screening by the nucleus, which drives the electrons back
to the z axis and leads to stable bending vibrations of the
conﬁguration (see in this context also the “asynchronous”
orbit discussed in [39, 40]). Marginal stability (with Lya-
punov exponent 0) is encountered for antisymmetric dis-
placements – e.g., with y1(t = 0) =
y2(t = 0) – which
is a consequence of angular symmetry and the resulting
conservation of the total angular momentum.

−

In the presence of an external driving, however, with
the phase of the ﬁeld chosen such as to stabilize the
collinear orbit, the angular symmetry is broken and the
marginally stable degree of freedom is transformed into
an unstable one. This can be understood from the net
torque that the ﬁeld exerts onto the atom. If the conﬁg-
uration is slightly tilted with respect to the z axis (e.g.,
y2(t = 0)),
by small initial components y1(t = 0) =
the external force is no longer directed parallel to the
semimajor axis of the Kepler orbits, but exhibits a small
perpendicular component. At the outer turning point of
the Kepler oscillation, where the contribution to the net
torque is most eﬀective, this perpendicular component of
the force is directed away from the z axis (see Fig. 7(a))
and therefore tends to enhance the initially small dis-
placement from collinearity.

−

This phenomenon of transverse instability arises also
in the resonantly driven hydrogen atom.
In the one-
electron case, however, the two-dimensional motion that
results from a small displacement from the ﬁeld polariza-

tion axis is bounded by means of dynamical barriers in
phase space and does not lead to ionization. Such dynam-
ical barriers do not exist in the two-electron case, due to
the high dimensionality of the phase space. Fig. 7 shows
what happens when the conﬁguration starts from an ini-
tial condition that corresponds to the stabilized collinear
orbit, with one of the electrons slightly displaced in y
direction. We clearly see that the external ﬁeld drives
the conﬁguration away from the z axis (Fig. 7(a)) and
rotates it around the nucleus (Fig. 7(b,c)). At about 40
ﬁeld cycles, when one such rotation is completed, the cor-
relation between the electrons breaks down and the atom
eventually undergoes single ionization.

The scenario encountered here is indeed very similar
to the case of the resonantly driven Zee (frozen planet)
conﬁguration [18, 19, 21], which is also unstable against
deviations from collinearity. For that case as well as
for the resonantly driven hydrogen atom [41, 42], it is
known that the application of an additional, static elec-
tric ﬁeld parallel to the polarization of the driving can
enforce transverse stability of the conﬁguration. For this
purpose, the static electric ﬁeld needs to be directed such
that it prevents the electrons from approaching the z = 0
plane – and thereby counterbalances the destabilization
mechanism induced by the torque of the time-periodic
driving.

FIG. 8: Transverse stabilization of the asymmetric stretch
orbit at F0 = 0.074 by means of a magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.5
polarized along the z axis. The initial condition corresponds
to the stabilized collinear orbit, with the electron on the right-
hand side transversally displaced by ∆y = 0.5. Plotted are
the y and z components of the three-dimensional trajectory
over 30 ﬁeld cycles. We see that the transverse conﬁnement
provided by the magnetic ﬁeld leads to a stable, quasiperiodic
oscillation around the ﬁeld polarization axis.

In the case of the driven eZe conﬁguration, a homo-
geneous static electric ﬁeld cannot be used to prevent
transverse destabilizaton, since it cannot be oriented in
such a way that it simultaneously keeps both electrons
from approaching the z = 0 plane. An eﬀective alterna-
tive, however, is provided by the possibiliy of adding a
strong static magnetic ﬁeld, which is oriented along the z
axis, i.e., parallel to the polarization of the driving. Due
to the tight diamagnetic conﬁnement created by such a
magnetic ﬁeld, small deviations from collinearity are not
enhanced, but lead to stable (three-dimensional) rota-
tions of the electrons around the z axis. This is illustrated
in Fig. 8 which shows the two-dimensional projection of
a trajectory that starts in the vicinity of the collinear
stabilized asymmetric stretch orbit at F0 = 0.074, in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld with strength B0 = 0.5 ori-
ented along the z axis. The initial displacement of the
electron on the right-hand side is y1 = 0.5, which indi-
cates a rather large phase space volume of the associated
regular island.

For the asymmetric stretch orbit at F0 = 0.074, we ﬁnd
0.2 . . . 2
that magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the range B0 ≃
can be used to provide transverse stability of the conﬁg-
uration [43]. Since a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B is
incorporated into the Hamiltonian via the substitution

it is scaled according to B
(i = 1, 2),
when a scaling transformation of the type (2) is ap-
plied. Hence, at double excitations corresponding to
the principal quantum number N = 25 . . . 30, where the
EBK criterion predicts fully localized quantum states on
the asymmetric stretch island, a “scaled” magnetic ﬁeld
strength B0 = 0.2 (at ω = 1) would roughly correspond
to B = (4πN/S0)−3B0 ∼

IV. QUANTUM SIGNATURES OF THE
STABILIZED ASYMMETRIC STRETCH ORBIT

After having shown the possibility to stabilize the
asymmetric stretch orbit in the classical eZe conﬁgura-
tion of helium, we discuss in this section to which ex-
tent this classical stabilization manifests itself in the cor-
responding quantum system. In principle, a full-blown
three-dimensional treatment of doubly excited helium in
the electromagnetic ﬁeld would be desirable in this con-
text. While such ab initio calculations can indeed be
performed in the unperturbed two-electron atom (up to
principal quantum numbers of the order of N
15 . . . 20
[45] – which, as we shall see later on, should be suﬃcient
for our purpose), they are still impractical in the pres-
ence of a nonperturbative time-dependent electric ﬁeld
where the conservation of the total angular momentum
is broken and the Floquet formalism is required to obtain
wave packet states associated with the resonantly driven
collinear orbit. Essential properties of these wave pack-
ets, however, can be reproduced from a one-dimensional
model of the two-electron atom which properly takes into
account the dynamics along the ﬁeld polarization axis.
This is particularly the case if a magnetic ﬁeld is ap-
plied in order to provide stability in the transverse de-
grees of freedom; the electrons are then strongly conﬁned
in the x–y plane and evolve according to an eﬀective one-
dimensional dynamics along the z axis.

≃

To correctly describe this dynamics, we demand that
the one-dimensional model represents the exact quantum
analog of the classical eZe conﬁguration. This in partic-
ular requires to take into account the full Coulomb inter-
action between the charged particles. A smoothening of
the Coulomb singularity, which is frequently employed in
one-dimensional models of driven atoms (e.g., [46]), may
not be permitted here, since it would lead to a consid-
erably diﬀerent behaviour in the corresponding classical
system.

Consequently, we write the Hamiltonian that generates
the quantum dynamics of the driven collinear conﬁgura-
tion as

the amplitude F and the frequency ω, is incorporated in
the velocity gauge in order to ensure good convergence of
the numerical calculation [47]. Eﬀectively, the electrons
appear here as distinguishable particles (with ζ1, ζ2 > 0),
which is consistent with the classical impenetrability of
the Coulomb singularity at the origin.

Due to the temporal periodicity of the Hamiltonian,
the Schr¨odinger problem represented by (8) is conve-
niently treated in the framework of Floquet theory.
The latter states that any solution ψt(ζ1, ζ2) of the

For atomic systems, the ω-periodic Floquet spectrum

state of the unperturbed atom is coupled to the atomic
continuum via multiphoton transitions and therefore ap-
pears as a resonance structure in the spectrum. In order
to separate these spectral resonances from the ﬂat back-
ground, we employ the method of complex scaling (see
[48] for a recent review), which has proven its usefulness
in a variety of numerical studies in atomic and molec-
ular physics. Essentially, the electronic coordinates are
ζjeiθ, and the momenta
complexiﬁed according to ζj 7→

exhibit divergent potential matrix elements. The scal-
ing parameter α, which can be freely chosen in principle,
determines the maximum spatial extension (as well as
the minimum coarse graining) that is represented by a

In the unperturbed atomic system (F = 0), the eigen-
states of H are characterized by a well-deﬁned “parity”:
they are either “even” or “odd” with respect to the ex-
change of ζ1 and ζ2:

ψ(ζ1, ζ2) =

Within each of these two symmetry classes, the spectrum
can be grouped into series that converge towards single
ionization thresholds, which are labelled by the principal
quantum number N of the inner electron. Naturally, this
classiﬁcation cannot be carried out in a perfectly rigorous
way, since N is not a good quantum number. In practice,
ambiguities arise as soon as states belonging to diﬀerent
series start to resonantly interact with each other, which
5 (see also [49]).
is the case for N

For each parity, the energetically lowest member of
each series exhibits a pronounced localization in the
vicinity of the classical asymmetric stretch orbit. This
is illustrated in Fig. 9, which shows the densities of the
lowest even and odd states at principal quantum number
N = 10. The probability distributions of these “asym-
metric stretch states” are in fact rather similar to the pro-
jections of three-dimensional intra-shell eigenfunctions
(with maximum interelectronic angle) onto the ζ1 – ζ2
subspace [25], which are also localized along the collinear
asymmetric stretch orbit.

Due to the enforced node at ζ1 = ζ2, the energy EN −
of the odd asymmetric stretch state is, at given N , con-
siderably enhanced with respect to the energy EN + of the
even state, and lies approximately in the middle between
EN + and E(N +1)+. More precisely, the scaling laws (2)

the level spacing between two consecutive asymmetric
stretch states. This implies that these states are nearly
degenerate in the resulting Floquet spectrum, and be-
come strongly coupled to each other as soon as the time-
periodic perturbation is switched on. Provided the size
of the classical island is large enough, this coupling gives
rise to a Floquet state that corresponds to a nondisper-
sive two-electron wave packet anchored on the stabilized
asymmetric stretch orbit.

≥

Contrary to the estimation based on the EBK crite-
rion (see Section II), such nondispersive wave packets
are already found at principal quantum numbers N
8.
An example of such a wave packet, centered around the
even asymmetric stretch state at N = 10, is shown in
Fig. 11, where the probability density of the correspond-
ing Floquet state is plotted for the driving phases ωt = 0,
π/4, π/2, and 3π/4. The driving frequency was set to

F0 = 0.074 the scaled amplitude at which the size of the
classical island is maximized. We clearly see that the
wave packet faithfully traces the motion of the classical
trajectory along the asymmetric stretch orbit. Signiﬁcant
contributions to the probability density far from the or-
bit indicate, however, that the Floquet state is not yet
perfectly localized on the island at this particular value
of N .

F0 = 0.074 (the underlying orbit was accordingly scaled, see
Fig. 9(a)). Signiﬁcant contributions to the probability density
far from the orbit reveal that the classical resonance island is,
at this value of N , not yet big enough to support a fully
localized quantum state.

The spectral evolution from the unperturbed asym-
metric stretch state to the nondispersive wave packet
on the stabilized orbit is illustrated in Fig. 12(a) which
shows the Floquet spectrum as a function of the ﬁeld
amplitude F . Clearly, the Floquet level associated with
the stabilized asymmetric stretch orbit is shifted towards
higher quasienergies with increasing F (see [21] for the
analogous case in Zee helium), which is in accordance
with the fact that the energy of the classical orbit be-
comes slightly enhanced as well. Note the occurence of
huge avoided crossings (e.g., between the
and the (cid:3)
states), which make it diﬃcult to determine the states
that contain signiﬁcant contributions to the driven asym-
metric stretch state (in practice, the states were identi-
ﬁed by a visual inspection of the probability density in

wave packet cannot be fully contained within the classical
resonance island (see Fig. 11). A more pronounced sta-

for which the EBK quantization criterion predicts the
existence of fully localized quantum states on the res-

V. CONCLUSION

<

∼ F0

In summary, we have shown that the collinear asym-
metric stretch orbit of the classical helium atom can be
stabilized by means of a resonant electromagnetic per-
turbation. Within a reasonable range of ﬁeld amplitudes
(0.04 <
∼ 0.15 at ω = 1), the external driving induces
a local regular island in the phase space of collinear mo-
tion, in which the electrons perform stable quasiperiodic
oscillations around the stabilized asymmetric stretch or-
bit. The driven collinear atom is unstable with respect to
deviations from collinearity. However, a static magnetic
ﬁeld, oriented parallel to the driving ﬁeld polarization,
can be used to stabilize the conﬁguration by transver-
sally conﬁning the electrons to the vicinity of the ﬁeld
polarization axis.

The quantum signatures of this classical stabiliza-
tion phenomenon were elucidated by means of a one-
dimensional model of the two-electron atom which cap-
tures the essential properties of the dynamics along the
ﬁeld polarization axis. Within the Floquet spectrum of
the driven atom, wave packet states were identiﬁed which
follow, without spreading, the time-periodic Kepler-like
motion along the stabilized asymmetric stretch orbit.
Such nondispersive wave packets, which constitute the
quantum analog of the classical nonlinear resonance, arise
for symmetric double excitations with principal quantum
number N
8. At N = 10, a local maximum of the life
≥
time of the order of 5000 ﬁeld cycles was found near the
0.07 where the cross section
scaled ﬁeld amplitude F0 ≃
area of the classical resonance island is maximized.

∼

∼

The experimental realization of such nondispersive
wave packets is certainly diﬃcult, but does not seem im-
possible. Intrashell “asymmetric stretch”-like states with
maximum interelectronic angle were already populated
in high-resolution photoionization experiments up to the
principal quantum number N = 10 [37, 38]. At that
double excitation, the resonant driving of the asymmet-
ric stretch orbit would correspond to a laser frequency of
1013 Hz, while a laser intensity of
the order of ω/(2π)
108 W/cm2 would be required for sta-
the order of I
bilization. On the other hand, the magnetic ﬁeld that is
necessary to enforce the transverse conﬁnement along the
ﬁeld polarization axis would exceed 100 Tesla at N = 10,
which is too large to be realized in table-top like exper-
imental setups. It is not excluded, however, that wave
packet states can be localized on the driven collinear or-
bit even without the presence of an additional perturba-
tion that stabilizes the dynamics in the transverse de-
grees of freedom (in the same way as “scars”, which are
anchored on unstable periodic orbits in chaotic systems
[51]). To examine to which extent such “scarred” wave
packet states exist in the absence of a stabilizing mag-
netic ﬁeld (and to which extent the classically allowed
decay via the transverse degrees of freedom would inﬂu-

ence their life time), a more quantitative study, taking
into account the dynamics within the two-dimensional
conﬁguration space, would be required.

Indeed, one can straightforwardly show that the com-

same time evolution of zi and pi as the original equations
of motion derived from (A1), provided the initial value
of the energy variable is set to E = H
|t=0. Eqs. (A5–A8)
permit stable numerical integration over simple electron-
nucleus collisions, and become singular only in the ex-
ceptional event of a triple collision.

APPENDIX B: IDENTIFICATION OF THE
PERIODICALLY DRIVEN
ASYMMETRIC-STRETCH ORBIT

The periodic orbits of the driven eZe conﬁguration of
helium are identiﬁed using the so-called stability trans-
formation (ST) method [53, 54, 55, 56]. The latter al-
lows to detect unstable periodic orbits of length p in the
n-dimensional chaotic time-discrete systems

1 is a scalar parameter and C is a con-
where 0 < λ
stant, regular, and real matrix. While the positions of
the ﬁxed points of s are exactly the same as in the origi-
nal system f (p), their stability properties depend on the
matrix C and the parameter λ. The goal is to choose
these parameters in such a way that the ﬁxed point X0
to be located becomes stable with respect to the map
s; the more unstable X0 is in the original system, the
smaller λ has to be chosen in order to achieve stabiliza-
tion [53, 54, 55, 56]. X0 is then obtained as a point
of convergence when propagating a properly chosen set
of initial points with the stability transformed system s.
The most dominating advantages of the algorithm are the
large extensions of the basins of attraction of the individ-
ual ﬁxed points and the fast convergence of trajectories
far from these ﬁxed points.

In general, a single transformation s is not suﬃcient to
stabilize all ﬁxed points of the original system. The above
procedure is therefore applied to a set of transforma-
tions si with diﬀerent matrices Ci (i = 1, 2, ..., N ). For
our particular case of motion within the four-dimensional

phase space spanned by (z1, z2, pz1, pz2), we ﬁnd that the

For time-continuous systems, periodic orbits are repre-
sented by ﬁxed points of a suitably deﬁned Poincar´e map
f (X), which permits their detection by the ST method
[57].
In our case of a periodically driven system with
two degrees of freedom, the Poincar´e map is most conve-
niently chosen as the stroboscopic map that transforms
the phase space variables to their propagated values after
one period T = 2π/ω of the driving:

f : (z1, z2, pz1, pz2)

(z1, z2, pz1, pz2)

|t+T .

(B4)

An initial distribution that is chosen uniform in phase
5 < E < 0 for the
space (with the additional limitation

initial energy E) proved to be favourable for the detection
of large sets of periodic orbits with unlimited lengths.

≈

For polishing-up the coordinates X = (z1, z2, pz1, pz2)
of the periodic orbits, a Newton algorithm is applied af-
ter convergence of the ST method up to a certain ac-
10−2. To this end, the monodromy ma-
curacy ǫ
trix associated with the actual ﬁxed point X0 is ap-
proximately calculated by propagating the four points
Xi = X + η ei (i = 1, ..., 4) under the Poincar´e map f ,
where ei are orthogonal unit vectors in phase space and
1. The individual columns mi of the mon-
0 < η
≪
odromy matrix M = (m1, m2, m3, m4) are then given
by mi = (f (Xi)
f (X))/η. This monodromy matrix is
then used to improve the accuracy of the ﬁxed point by
the Newton method.

−

In a similar way, the Newton method can also be em-
ployed to identify a given periodic orbit at the ﬁeld am-
plitude F + δF , once the corresponding orbit at ﬁeld
amplitude F is converged. In that case, the ﬁxed point
X(F )
at F would be used as starting point for the search
0
of the ﬁxed point X(F +δF )
at F + δF (a robust damping
0
of the Newton algorithm by a factor ρ
0.1 is neces-
sary there to ensure stable convergence [58]). This proce-
dure turned out to be particularly eﬃcient for identifying
(within a single run) the asymmetric stretch orbits at all
ﬁeld amplitudes within the range 0
1 (a stepsize
δF = 0.001 was used in practice). Also other periodic or-
bits, which were found by the ST method, were “traced”
in this way for increasing ﬁeld amplitude F . While their
Lyapunov exponents may exhibit local minima at ﬁnite
F , none of them – except the asymmetric stretch orbit –
was found to become stable.

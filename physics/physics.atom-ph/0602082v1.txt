A black-body radiation (BBR) shifts of nsnp 3P0 − ns2 1S0 clock transition in divalent atoms Mg,
Ca, Sr, and Yb are evaluated. A theory of multipolar BBR shifts is developed and its implications
are discussed. At room temperatures, the resulting uncertainties in the BBR shifts are relatively
−18 fractional accuracy of the optical-lattice-based
large and substantially aﬀect the projected 10
clocks.

Atomic clocks based on ultranarrow 3P0 −1 S0 tran-
sition in divalent atoms may oﬀer a new level of time-
keeping accuracy.
In this scheme the atoms are con-
ﬁned in optical lattice. The lattice laser wavelength is
selected in such a way that the dominant perturbation
of the clock frequency, the induced ac Stark shifts, for
both clock states exactly cancel. Although other eﬀects
still perturb the clock frequency, estimates [1] indicate
that the projected fractional uncertainty of such clocks
may be as low as 10−18. By comparison, 10−15 is the
fractional uncertainty of the current Cs standard realiz-
ing the SI deﬁnition of the unit of time. This apparent
advantage of the optical-lattice clocks has motivated a
number of recent proposals: original Katori’s scheme [2]
with fermionic Sr isotopes has been extended to Mg [3],
Ca [4], and Yb [5] atoms and to bosonic isotopes [6, 7].
In addition, various schemes of probing the highly-
forbidden nsnp 3P0 − ns2 1S0 clock transition have been
proposed: three-photon transition, electromagnetically-
induced transparency, and transition assisted by external
magnetic ﬁeld [6, 7, 8].

Considering advantages of optical lattice clocks, here
we investigate an important systematic eﬀect of the
black-body radiation (BBR) on the frequency of the
3P0 −1 S0 clock transition.
Indeed, the SI deﬁnition of
the second explicitly involves atomic clock operating at
the absolute zero of temperature. In a laboratory envi-
ronment with an ambient temperature T , one needs to
introduce the T -dependent BBR correction to the ob-
served frequency. Here, using techniques of many-body
relativistic atomic structure, we compute the BBR shift
for Mg, Ca, Sr, and Yb and evaluate uncertainties of
the calculations. As summarized in Table I, the result-
ing fractional uncertainties in the clock frequencies at
T = 300 K are large, ranging from 1 × 10−17 for Mg to
3 × 10−16 for Yb.

The main conclusions of this paper are (i) the present
uncertainty in our computed BBR shift is an obstacle on
the way towards the projected 10−18 accuracy goal; (ii)
due to T 4 scaling of the BBR shift, it may be beneﬁcial
to operate at low temperatures, e.g., at liquid nitrogen
temperatures; (iii) if operating at room temperatures,

high-precision (0.02%-accurate for Sr) measurements of
the BBR shifts or related quantities are required; (iv)
Mg-based clock is the least susceptible to BBR; com-
pared to Sr, the Mg BBR shift is an order of magnitude
smaller (see Table I). Additionally, we develop a general
relativistic theory of the BBR shift caused by multipolar
(EJ and MJ) components of the radiation ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we derive
relativistic formulae for the BBR shift which incorporate
various multipolar contributions of the radiation ﬁeld.
Secondly, we apply these general expressions to deter-
mination of the BBR shifts in optical-lattice clocks with
Mg, Ca, Sr, and Yb atoms. Unless speciﬁed otherwise,
atomic units and the Gaussian system of electromagnetic
units are used throughout. In these units, c = 1/α, where
α ≈ 1/137 is the ﬁne-structure constant. Temperature
is expressed in units of Eh/kB, where Eh is the Hartree
energy and kB is the Boltzmann constant.

Multipolar theory of the black-body radiation shift. The
BBR shift is caused by perturbation of the atomic en-
ergy levels by the oscillating thermal radiation. Both
atomic levels involved in the clock transition are per-
turbed and the overall BBR correction is a diﬀerence of
the BBR shifts for the two levels. We ﬁnd that deter-
mining shift for the upper 3P0 level requires certain care.
This level is a part of the 3PJ ﬁne-structure manifold,
J = 0, 1, 2. The separation between the levels in the
manifold is comparable to the characteristic wavenum-

ber of the BBR radiation, 208.51 cm−1, at T = 300 K,
and contributions of the BBR-induced magnetic-dipole
and electric-quadrupole transitions to the levels of the
manifold may be enhanced. Taking these induced transi-
tions into account requires going beyond the conventional
electric-dipole approximation, Ref. [9].

Considering a potential importance of the multipolar
contributions, in this section we derive the relevant for-
mulae for BBR-induced energy shifts. Although we de-
velop a general relativistic theory including retardation,
at the end of the section we reduce our expressions to
practically important non-relativistic non-retarded for-
mulas. The derived expressions are generalization of the
electric-dipole BBR shift of Ref. [9].

A cursory examination of these formulas reveals that
compared to 2J multipole, the contribution of 2J+1 mul-
tipole is suppressed by a factor of α2 ≈ (1/137)2. Also
for the same J the magnetic contribution is α2 weaker
than that of the EJ photons. As in the theory of multi-
polar radiative transitions E(J+1) and MJ contributions
are of the same order in α.

Functions FJ (y) are multipolar generalizations of func-
tion F (y) introduced by Farley and Wing [9] in the E1
case. We plot our computed FJ functions for J = 1, 2, 3
in Fig. 1. FJ (y) are odd functions with respect to y.
From examining Fig. 1, it is clear that FJ rapidly change
around y ∼ 1 and slowly fall oﬀ for y ≫ 1. Depending
on the value of excitation energy, ωpg = y T , a particular
intermediate state may introduce either negative or pos-
itive BBR shift. Notice that FJ are broad distributions,
they have comparable values for |y| . 20; this will have
implications for interpreting our results.

At large values of the argument |y| ≫ 1, FJ (y) ∝ 1/y.
The limit y ≫ 1 corresponds to the case when the tran-
sition energy is much larger than T . If all virtual tran-
sitions satisfy this requirement, then the leading contri-
bution to the multipolar BBR shift can be expressed in

where ζ is the Riemann zeta-function. As the scaling
factor, α2J+1T 2J+2 , is expressed in atomic units, we
observe that as multipolarity J increases by one, in addi-
tion to the usual α2 suppression, there is a temperature
suppression factor of (kBT /Eh)2. For T = 300 K this
suppression is sizable, as (kBT /Eh)2 ≈ 9.0 × 10−7.

BBR shift for 3P0 − 1S0 transition in divalent atoms.
Below we apply the developed formalism to computing
the BBR shift for the 1S0 −3P0 clock transition in divalent
atoms. We will assume that the atoms are at the ambient
temperature of T = 300 K. Both clock levels experience
the BBR shift and the total shift δνBBR is the diﬀerence
between the two individual shifts, δνBBR = δνBBR(3P0)−
δνBBR(1S0).

Consider ﬁrst the BBR shift of the ground 1S0 state.
Here transition energies of various multipolar transi-
tions to the upper levels are much larger than T , i.e.,
we are in the y ≫ 1 limit of Fig. 1. Here compared
to the dominant E1-induced shift, the contribution of
M1 transitions is suppressed by α2 ∼ 10−4 and E2 by
α2 (kBT /Eh)2 ∼ 10−10. Higher-order multipoles are
suppressed even more. As to the retardation eﬀects in
E1 matrix elements, we expect that they would be sup-
pressed by a factor of α2 (kBT /Eh)2 ∼ 10−10. Neverthe-
less, since the fractional contribution of the BBR shift to
the clock frequency is at 5 × 10−15 level (see Table I),
one would need to introduce the M1 corrections at the
projected accuracy of 10−18.

For the 3P0 levels, the characteristic thermal pho-
ton frequency is comparable to the ﬁne-structure inter-
vals for the 3PJ manifold. The 3P0 level is connected
by M1 transition to the 3P1 level and by E2 transi-
tion to the 3P2 level. For these transitions the values
of the relevant functions FJ ∼ 1, see Fig. 1, and we
∼ α2 (αT )3, δE(E2)
estimate δE(M1)
∼ (αT )5, while
δE(E1)
∼ α3(T )4/ω3D1−3P0 . Our numerical estimate,

based on the transitions inside the ﬁne-structure man-
ifold lead to the following values of the BBR shifts for

= 2.4 × 10−5 Hz and δE(E2)

Sr: δE(M1)
= 2.5 × 10−8 Hz.
Since the E1 BBR shift for Sr is ∼ 2 Hz, the M1 and E2
contributions can be neglected at the present 1%-level of
accuracy of our calculations.

g

We ﬁnd that although the thermal photon energy is
close to the ﬁne-structure intervals, the induced multi-
pole BBR shifts are not ampliﬁed. The main reason is
that the BBR energy distribution is broad: the universal
functions FJ have comparable values for a wide range of
excitation energies, |ω| . 20 T , see Fig. 1. For example,
for Sr 3P0 − 3D1 E1 transition F1 ≈ 0.16, while for the
3P0− 3P1 M1 transition F1 ≈ −0.41 and for the 3P0− 3P2
E2 transition F2 ≈ −0.36. For such a broad distribution,
the multipolar BBR shift is determined by the prefactor
in Eq. (4) resulting in a suppression of multipoles beyond
E1.

Based on the above discussion, we may exclusively fo-
cus on the electric-dipole (J = 1, λ = 1) contribution to
the BBR shift. ¿From our general expressions we obtain
an approximate formula,

Evaluation of the static dipole polarizabilities follows
a procedure of Ref. [11]. Here we only outline the ma-
jor steps. We employ relativistic many-body code de-
scribed in Refs. [12, 13, 14]. The employed formalism
is a combination of conﬁguration-interaction method in
the valence space with many-body perturbation theory
for core-polarization eﬀects. In this method, one deter-
mines wave functions from solving the eﬀective many-
body Schr¨odinger equation

{HFC + Σ(E)} |Ψni = En |Ψni ,

(8)

Here HFC is the frozen-core Dirac-Hartree-Fock Hamil-
tonian and self-energy operator Σ is a core-polarization
correction. To improve upon this approximation, one
can introduce an adjustable energy shift δ and replace
Σ(E) → Σ(E − δ) in the eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (8).
We have determined δ empirically, from a ﬁt of theoreti-
cal energy levels to experimental spectrum. Inclusion of
this shift mimics high-order corrections in perturbation
theory. In addition, we incorporated dressing of the ex-
ternal electromagnetic ﬁeld (core shielding) in the frame-
work of the random-phase approximation (RPA). To ﬁnd

valence contribution to α(E1)
(0) we summed over the in-
termediate states in Eq. (3) using the Dalgarno-Lewis-
Sternheimer method [15]. A small correction to polariz-
ability due to core-excited intermediate states in Eq. (3)
was computed within the relativistic RPA.

The results of calculations for the static electric dipole
polarizabilties for the ns2 1S0 and nsnp 3P0 states are
presented in Table II. The listed values of the ground-
state polarizabilities of Mg, Ca, and Sr were obtained
by us earlier [11]. To estimate their uncertainties we
used the fact that the intermediate state nsnp 1P1 con-
tributes to the polarizability at the level of 95-97%. For
calculating the polarizabilities we used the best known
in the literature values of the hns2 1S0||D||nsnp 1P1i ma-
trix elements tabulated in [11]. For instance, for Sr
|h5s2 1S0||D||5s5p 1P1i| = 5.249(2) a.u.
leading to 0.1%
error in α1S0 . The uncertainties in the remaining po-
larizabilities were estimated as a half of the diﬀerence
between two predictions obtained with δ = 0 and with
δ determined with the best ﬁt to the experimental en-
ergies (thus mimicking omitted higher-order many-body
corrections). The uncertainties in the ground-state po-
larizabilities range from 0.1% for Sr to 3% for Yb. For
the 3P0 states the errors range from 0.3% for Mg to 6%
for Yb.

With the computed polarizabilities we can ﬁnd the
BBR frequency shifts with Eq.(7). The “dynamic” cor-

4

rection η is negligible for the 1S0 states, but is needed
for the 3P0 calculations.
Indeed, for the ground state,
1 − E1S0 is equal to
the smallest excitation energy E1P o
21698 cm−1 for Sr. At T = 300 K the characteristic
value of y ∼ 100 for all the atoms. By contrast, for
the 3P0 clock level, the transitions to the nearby 3D1
level involve smaller energies. For Sr, the relevant en-
ergy is only 3841 cm−1 corresponding to characteristic
value of y ∼ 20. At this value, the “static polarizabil-
ity” approximation, F1(y) ≈ 4π3/(45y), has only a few
percent accuracy. While evaluating η we ﬁnd it suﬃcient
to truncate the summation over intermediate states at
the lowest-energy excitation. This “dynamic” correction
contributes to the BBR shift of the 3P0 state at 0.1% level
in Mg, 1% in Ca, 2.7% in Sr, and 0.7% in Yb. Notice
that since the clock BBR shift is obtained by subtracting
BBR shifts of the individual levels, the “dynamic” cor-
rection contributes at an enhanced 5% level in Sr. These
“dynamic” corrections must be taken into account if the
BBR shifts are derived from dc Stark shift measurements.

Finally, we combine the BBR shifts of the individual
clock levels and arrive at the overall BBR corrections
summarized in Table I. Our computed BBR shift for
Sr, −2.354(32) Hz is in agreement with an estimate [1]
of −2.4(1) Hz. Our uncertainties are better than 3%,
except for Yb where the error is 10%. As discussed in
the introduction, although resulting from state-of-the-art
relativistic atomic-structure calculations, these errors are
still large and substantially aﬀect the projected 10−18
fractional accuracy of the lattice-based clocks (see Ta-
ble I). Potential solution involves operating the clocks at
cryogenic temperatures.

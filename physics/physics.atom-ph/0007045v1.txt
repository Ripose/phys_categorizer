Abstract

Fixed energy inverse scattering theory has been used to deﬁne central and
spin-orbit Schr¨odinger potentials for the scattering of 5 eV polarized electrons
from Xe atoms. The results are typical for a range of such data; including
energies above threshold when the potentials become complex. The phase
shifts obtained from an analysis of the measured diﬀerential cross section and
analyzing power has been used as input data. Both semi-classical (WKB)
and fully quantal inversion methods have been used to extract central and
spin-orbit interactions. The analysis shows that information additional to the
set of input phase shifts extracted from this (and similar) data may be needed
to ascertain physical potentials.

I. INTRODUCTION

A knowledge of the interaction between colliding quantum systems is central in many
applications of scattering and has relevance for use in other diverse ﬁelds of study. Such inter-
actions have been sought in various ways with the method of numerical inversion common.
In the numerical inversion approach, the parameter values of a purely phenomenological
parametric form, chosen a priori to be the (central, local) interaction between the colliding
entities, are determined by variation until a best ﬁt to measured data is found. Global inverse
scattering methods [1] form an alternative procedural class with which to analyze the same
data. With global inverse scattering methods, the interaction between the colliding pair
is extracted from the data without a priori assumptions about the shape of the potential,
although it may belong to a certain broad class, and the validity of the dynamical equation
of motion (the Schr¨odinger equation) is assumed. Potentials so obtained we deﬁne here-
after as inversion potentials. Application of various global inverse scattering methods have
been made in the past for electron-atom [2], for atom-atom [3], and for electron-molecule [4]
systems, but none of those methods permitted extraction of spin-orbit eﬀects. Recent de-
velopments [5–7] have provided means by which spin eﬀects can be treated. In this paper
we present and describe results for central and spin-orbit potentials obtained by global in-
verse scattering methods.
In particular we consider an approach based upon the WKB
approximation method [1,8] and one based upon the Newton-Sabatier (N-S) theory [1].

The data of interest come from the very high quality crossed beams experiment of Gibson
et al. [9]. In that study [9], a phase shift analysis was also made and the phase shifts so
obtained were the input quantities to our studies. Those phase shifts are purely real in
line with the unitarity constraint with the energy below the ﬁrst threshold. Thus we have
obtained purely real inversion potentials. Extension of the approach to deal with energies
above threshold and, concomitantly with complex potentials, is straightforward. The key
feature about inversion potentials, given numerical accuracy in calculations and stability of
the solution, is that when used in Schr¨odinger equations they lead to the same phase shifts
as are input.

(the ± superscripts denoting j = l ± 1

The data set we have chosen to use is intriguing for a number of reasons. First, the
diﬀerences between the values of δ+
2) ex-
tracted by the phase shift analysis [9] are not large indicating that the spin-orbit interaction
is not strong. As a result the approximation method of Leeb, Huber and Fiedeldey [5]
(LHF hereafter) can be used with conﬁdence. Indeed the LHF scheme is accurate through
second order in Born approximation and has worked well in some nuclear scattering data
analyses [10] where the spin-orbit eﬀect is much stronger than in the case we study. With
the LHF approximation, both the N-S and the semi-classical WKB methods of inverse scat-
tering theory can be used to specify the electron-Xenon (e-Xe) potentials. Exact quantal
inversion methods to get the spin-orbit interaction are known [6,7], but with this data the
LHF approximation should be adequate and the inversion process is facilitated by its use.
Second, the phase shifts of signiﬁcance are not many in number and so this may be another
case with which phase shift values at unphysical rational values of angular momentum are
required in the inversion process to achieve a stable result [11]. A third reason for interest is
that the s- and p-wave phase shifts from the analysis [9] of the scattering data have negative
values. All other (physical) phase shifts of signiﬁcance are positive quantities. As phase

2

shifts are ambiguous to modulo π, an equivalent completely positive valued and monoton-
ically decreasing phase shift set can be formed by the addition of 2π and π to the s- and
p-wave values respectively. With either of the original or the modulated (integer l) phase
shift sets as input, the N-S inversion method per se gives the same inversion potential. How-
ever, that potential has a short ranged repulsion; such being required [12] to give signiﬁcant
negative s- and p-wave phase shifts. The WKB inversion method on the other hand, does
discriminate between these sets since to specify the WKB inversion potential interpolated
functions, δl(λ), are required as input. Of course if the N-S method is extended to use phase
shifts at rational values of the angular momentum, found for example by interpolation of the
original sets [9] and of the those with s- and p-wave values adjusted by 2π and π respectively,
then the inversion potentials from the two cases must diﬀer.

Thus we give two new elements in this paper. First we deduce by inverse scattering
theories, central and spin-orbit potentials for 5 eV electron-Xenon atom scattering. Second,
we show that information additional to the physical phase shifts (i.e. those determined by
usual phase shift analyses of scattering data) is needed to identify the the most likely physical
inversion potential. In the next section we give a pr´ecis of the LHF approximation for phase
shifts as well as of the inverse scattering methods used, the N-S and the WKB semi-classical
schemes speciﬁcally. Then in Sec. III, we discuss the origins and characteristics of the 5 eV
e-Xe scattering phase shifts that have been used as input to our inversion studies. The e-Xe
potentials that result are presented and discussed in Sec. IV and we draw conclusions in
Sec. V.

II. FIXED ENERGY INVERSION METHODS

In this section we give brief outlines of the methods used in the calculations, the results of
which we report later. First we set out the LHF scheme by which the spin-orbit interaction
can be deﬁned from two independent (spin-less) inversion calculations. This identiﬁes not
only the special phase shift sets {ˆδl} and {˜δl} of the method, but also deﬁnes the central
and spin-orbit potentials in terms of the results of inversions of those new phase shift sets,
ˆV and ˜V respectively. Then we give the salient features of the Newton-Sabatier and the
semi-classical WKB inverse scattering theories which we have used to specify the ( ˆV and ˜V )
potentials.

A. The LHF approximation

While exact quantal inverse scattering theories that yield central and spin-orbit inter-
actions from input scattering phase shift sets exist [6,7], Leeb, Huber, and Fiedeldey [5]
developed an approximation scheme to transform the input phase shift sets so that more
facile quantal inverse scattering methods, such as the N-S scheme [1] and the semi-classical
WKB approximation [8], can be used to give results from which central and spin-orbit po-
tentials can be extracted. Those more facile schemes do not allow for an angular momentum
dependence in the intrinsic equation of motion, such as given by a spin-orbit potential. They
are designed only to provide central local potential functions.

3

The LHF method is based on the assumption that the contribution of the spin-orbit
potential to the phase shifts can be evaluated using a Distorted Wave Born Approximation.
This technique has been formulated speciﬁcally for spin 1
2 particles incident on spin zero
targets and is accurate to second order in the Born expansion [5]. The approximation
identiﬁes ﬁrst the special phase shift sets {ˆδl} and {˜δl}, and then deﬁnes the central and
spin-orbit potentials in terms of the results, ˆV and ˜V respectively, from inversion of those
new phase shift sets.

higher terms must be considered to deﬁne the spin-orbit properties. But the speciﬁc analytic
forms of the coeﬃcients, C (n)

potential values. The LHF approximation is initiated by considering combinations of δ+ and
δ− from which separate inversion potentials can be estimated. The relevant combinations

B. The N-S method

Since the Newton-Sabatier inverse scattering theory and applications have been widely
reported, only pertinent points of the scheme are presented herein. A full treatment on the
development of this method is given elsewhere [1].

The N-S method is one of the most successful of the ﬁxed energy inversion methods. Very
recently, it has been applied successfully to electron-helium atom scattering [13] using as
input, experimental phase shifts of Nesbet [14] at low ℓ-values and dipole polarization phase
shifts at the higher ℓ-values. But it is known [15] that ﬁxed energy inverse scattering theory
requires the S matrix (equivalently the phase shifts) as a function of the angular momentum
variable if one is to deﬁne uniquely the scattering potential. This equates to knowing the
S matrix exactly at all of the (inﬁnite) set of physical l-values as then the unit step in the
quantum number is inﬁnitesimal against the range. Most studies of the ﬁxed energy inverse
scattering problem, and notably those involving the N-S method, have been applied using
only the values of the S matrix speciﬁed at a ﬁnite set (lmax) of physical angular momentum
values. In cases where there are relatively few important partial wave phase shift values to
be used, it may be necessary to extend [11] the usual N-S formulation to include rational
values of angular momenta to form the matrix inherent in the N-S scheme [1].

However it serves to consider for this section, just the integer values of angular momentum

for which the Schr¨odinger equations take the form (ρ = kr being dimensionless)

Du(ρ) φu

l (ρ) = l(l + 1) φu

l (ρ)

where the operator

Du(ρ) = ρ2" d2

with U(ρ) = V (ρ)/Ecm, where Ecm = (¯hk)2 / (2µ) and ρ = kr. The solutions are subject to

These equations are of central importance. From them one can determine the unknown
quantities, Al and (clAl), by matching asymptotically to the deﬁned boundary condition
solutions for ρ ≥ ρ0, ρ0 being the value at which the unknown quantal interactions are
presumed to be vanishingly small. There is also a presumption that the solution functions
of the reference potential are completely known so that the initiating L-matrices can be
deﬁned exactly. The reference solutions are obtained from

where δ0
l is a reference input phase shift. With the normalization and expansion coeﬃcients
so given, the complete solution functions can be determined from Eq. (15) at all ρ < ρ0.
Thereby one gets the Jost transformation kernels and thence the sought after potential.

C. The WKB method

In the WKB approximation with λ = l + 1

2, scattering phase shifts are deﬁned [1,12] by

δ(λ) =

λ − kr0 +Z ∞

r0

[Kλ(r′) − k] dr′

(19)

where Kλ(r) describes the local momentum through the interaction region and r0 is the
classical turning point. Thus the scattering potential is embedded in Kλ(r′) and inversion
amounts to an integral transformation. To eﬀect such a transformation it is convenient to
consider the deﬂection function

Θ(λ) = 2

dδ(λ)

dλ

,

(20)

where now λ is taken as the angular momentum variable. This deﬂection function satisﬁes
an Abel-like equation, found by applying the Sabatier transformation,

σ = kr"1 −

where Q(σ) is a quasi-potential deﬁned by

Q(σ) = 2E ln(cid:18) σ

The Abel-like integral equation for δ(λ) can be inverted to give

which can be written in terms of the deﬂection function as

Q(σ) =

Provided there is a one to one mapping of the transcendental equation

kr = σ exp Q(σ)

and the energy E exceeds that at which ‘orbiting’ occurs, i.e.

E > V (r) +

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

then the Sabatier transformation equation provides the relationship from which the scatter-
ing potential can be found, namely

VW KB(r) = E(1 − exp"−

Q(σ)

E #) .

(28)

For large σ, the quasi-potentials decrease so that with σ → kr, Q(σ) → V (r). As
σ → 0 however, the quasi-potentials diverge and the transforms then lead to the lower limits
r −→ r0 (the turning point radius), V (r) −→ E . However, in practical cases the validity of
the WKB approximation breaks down at a radius larger than r0, when the transcendental
relationship between σ and r becomes ambiguous.

III. SPECIFICATION OF SETS OF PHASE SHIFTS

The 5 eV e-Xe phase shifts determined by Gibson et.al . [9] have interesting structure
notably that while the s- and p-wave phase shifts are negative, for all other l-values they
are positive. The ﬁlled circles in Fig. 1 depict the the phase shifts that have been extracted
from the data. The top most graph identiﬁes the phase shifts associated with the j = l + 1
2
angular momentum set while the bottom panel contains those associated with j = l − 1
2.
It is evident from the data displayed in this ﬁgure that the there is only a small diﬀerence
between the δ±
l sets. The largest diﬀerence occurs with the p-wave phase shifts, and that is
only of order 0.1c.

As the phase shift analyses of the e-Xe scattering data gave negative values for the s-
and p-wave phase shifts, one can expect [12] scattering potentials that have a short ranged
repulsion. But for e-Xe scattering it is known that the potential should be attractive at all
radii and especially so near the origin where the incoming electron should feel essentially

7

only the presence of the nucleus. Then one would expect the phase shifts for low l-values
to be positive. Such can be formed with the phase shift values having a monotonic decrease
with l by the addition of 2π to δ(+)
1 . We deﬁne such modulated values as the
π-adjusted phase shifts hereafter. Naturally multiples of any integer amount may be used,
but this new set is the simplest. The new (π-adjusted) values are shown by the open circles
in Fig. 1. Associated with such phase shifts are purely attractive interactions which are
expected in the physical potentials for electron-atom scattering.

and π to δ±

0

To investigate the eﬀect of additional input on the form of the inversion potentials, the
two data sets were interpolated. Several interpolations were made seeking suitable input for
the diﬀerent inversion schemes. A many point interpolation was made on each phase shift
set to obtain the input for the WKB inversion scheme. Values of the phase shift functions
had to be found at quite small step sizes, ∆l, since in the WKB we have to evaluate not
only the deﬂection functions but also integrate over them (numerically). A step size ∆l of
0.01 was used. Also two extended sets of input phase shift values were generated for use
with the N-S scheme. One had ∆l = 0.5 and the other ∆l = 0.2. This was done to assess
the eﬀect of diﬀering numbers of non-physical input on the N-S inversion potentials. The
sets of interpolated phase shifts obtained using ∆l = 0.2 are displayed in Fig. 1, with the
solid and dashed curves giving the results of those (spline) interpolations. Clearly the phase
shift functions so speciﬁed are no longer equivalent and so we expect any inversion process
that requires such functions as input to give diﬀerent inversion potentials.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results we have obtained using the N-S inverse scattering theory are discussed ﬁrst
and, subsequently, those found from our WKB study of the chosen two phase shift functions
are considered. We present in three subsections, the potentials that result, the phase shifts
found from solutions of the Schr¨odinger equations containing those potentials, and the cross
sections that ensue in each case.

A. The results from N-S inverse scattering theory

Our N-S studies have lead to six inversion potentials; three found by using the original
phase shift values of Gibson et al. [9] and the other three obtained by using the π-adjusted
phase shifts. For each case, we ﬁrst calculated the N-S inversion potentials using as input
solely the phase shifts corresponding to the physical l angular momentum set l ∈ 0, 1, 2, ..., 7.
Such results we identify as case 1 results, e.g. case 1 inversion potentials from the π-adjusted
phase shift sets. Two other calculations have been made with N-S inversion. First the N-S
inverse scattering theory equations have been solved using the discretization ∆l = 0.5; the
results we identify by the designation case 2. The third set of N-S calculations were made
using ∆l = 0.2 to give what we term case 3 results.

1. The N-S inversion potentials

Physical arguments dictate that the e-Xe scattering potential for 5 eV electrons should be
real (the energy is below the ﬁrst threshold) and to be attractive, with long range behavior
of −|α|/r4 and a short ranged one of −Ze2/r. One may also expect that the intermediate
range potential would be essentially a monotonic function between the extremes as the
charge density of the atom is believed to be a smooth function

The potentials resulting from the inversion of the phase shifts based upon the original
set [9] are all strongly repulsive at small radii and hence are not considered physically
signiﬁcant. They also have marked oscillation in both their central and spin-orbit results.
When used in the Schr¨odinger equations however, the solutions do reproduce the input phase
shifts quite well; comparable to the results we show subsequently. But as the inversion
potentials are not consistent with the form of e-Xe potential dictated by knowledge of that
scattering system, we consider those inversion results no further.

In Fig. 2 the potentials obtained by inversion of the π-adjusted phase shift values are
displayed. The top and bottom segments portray the central and spin-orbit components of
the potentials respectively. The dashed, long dashed, and solid curves represent the case
1, case 2, and case 3 potentials respectively. The dashed curves in this ﬁgure are identical
to the results of inversion found using the original phase shift values of Gibson et al. [9]
That is as should be since within the N-S inversion scheme made with just the phase shift
values speciﬁed at the physical angular momenta, modulo π adjustment means that one uses
exactly the same expansion wave functions in deﬁning the internal matrices. But the other
cases have quite diﬀerent outcomes. The potentials shown in Fig. 2 tend to the physical
expectation and clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of greater numbers of phase shifts
at non-integer angular momentum lead to smoother, more realistic potential forms. The
inversion potential found using the phase shifts at solely the physical angular momenta
does not represent a structure expected for 5 eV electrons on Xe atoms as it has the short
ranged repulsion. However between 0.75 and 2.5 a.u., that (case 1 central) potential has an
attractive well with a depth of -1.3 a.u. while beyond 2.5 a.u. it behaves approximately as
r−4. The spin-orbit component of the case 1 potential is very small, is weakly attractive in
the vicinity of 1 a.u., mildly repulsive between 1 and 2.5 a.u., and after that it is essentially
zero.

Obviously the most realistic potential comes with the case 3 potentials found using the π-
adjusted phase shift sets. That concurs with the hypothesis that the inverse scattering theory
result stabilizes with increase in the number of non-integer angular momenta phase shifts
commensurate with numerical accuracy of evaluation. Essentially the angular momentum
step size should be small in comparison to the number of signiﬁcant partial wave input data
(lmax). This case 3 potential, shown in Fig. 2 by the solid lines, has exactly the structure
one would associate with e-Xe scattering. At small radii it is strongly attractive and of
r−1 form, with a smooth transition to a long range r−4 tail. There is a smooth transition
between those regions. The spin-orbit results also are more reasonable. The case 3 (with
π-adjusted phase shifts as input), spin-orbit potential is not as extensive as the others. But
the spin-orbit potentials are all small in general (save for the naturally occurring divergence
at the origin) and so these three results do not by themselves indicate convergence. The
reproduction of phase shifts and observables, however, tend to suggest that the results we

9

show are reasonable.

2. Reproduction of the phase shifts

An indication of the success of an inversion scheme is to reproduce the input phase shifts
from solutions of the Schr¨odinger equations using the inversion potentials.
In this case
such reproduction is reasonably good but not exact; perhaps being a measure of the LHF
approximation.

In Fig. 3, the original phase shift values [9] are portrayed by the ﬁlled circles and are
compared with those obtained (at integer angular momenta) using each of the three inversion
potentials deﬁned by the π-adjusted input sets. Case 1 results lie within the ﬁlled circles,
case 2 values are shown by the open squares, and case 3 gave the results portrayed by the
open circles. The three lines now are meant only to guide the eye by connecting the phase
shift values arising from use of the three inversion potentials.

The best reproduction of the phase shifts deﬁned from experiment [9] is found by us-
ing the case 1 inversion potential, notwithstanding that the potential contains unphysical
characteristics. Essentially, the inversion scheme in this case produces a potential that has
been deﬁned from just the two sets of eight phase shift values found by Gibson et al. at the
physical values of l = 0 to l = 7. Case 2 and 3 potentials, on the other hand, were built using
many more phase shifts speciﬁed at non-integer l-values and as the inversion potentials then
seek to reproduce all of those extra values equally well, small variations in the results at the
8 physical l-values from the sets of Gibson et al. can result. The choice of those additional
(unphysical) phase shifts then is crucial if the resulting potentials are to reproduce the eight
physical values very well. One has to balance the need for a suﬃciently large basis so that
the inversion potential has stabilized to the proper (physically credible) limit, against the
numerical accuracy one needs to achieve with reproduction of the physical phase shifts and
scattering data.

A source of possible error in addition is the choice that must be taken for the phase
j=− 1
. That value is needed in the calculations of both ˜δ and
shift at the unphysical point δ
0
ˆδ and also in the N-S scheme. This choice has the potential to introduce error since its
value inﬂuences the interpolation. A poor choice of this value can become evident when
the inversion potential is used to recalculate the phase shifts, particularly for the low-l
j=+ 1
j=− 1
.
equal to δ
partial waves. A reasonable choice seems to be to set the phase shift δ
0
0
Admittedly this is an arbitrary point. In this study, two choices were considered; the ﬁrst
j=− 1
being to take δ
and the other to use an Akima spline to determine the value by
0
extrapolation. In this study allowing the Akima spline to determine this point was slightly
more successful.

3. The cross section from the N-S inversion potentials

Although the potentials all look reasonably good, particularly that found from case 3
with the π-adjusted input phase shifts, the further test of the inversion results is to see how
accurately use of the potentials reproduce experimental data. This is displayed in Fig. 4
wherein the experimental data (with error bars) as found by Gibson et al. [9] are compared

10

with the cross sections calculated from the three inversion potentials obtained using the π-
adjusted phase shift sets. Those results found using the case 1, case 2, and case 3 inversion
potentials are depicted by the dashed, long dashed , and solid curves respectively. Further we
display the results here on a linear scale to distinguish the bulk of the results in relationship
to the error bars. Later when discussing the WKB calculated cross sections, we will display
also the case 3 N-S comparison with data shown on a semi-logarithmic plot. That emphasizes
the comparison of results with data at the large scattering angles and particularly in the
vicinity of the minima as 120◦. As one might expect from the reproduction of the phase
shifts, we see in Fig. 4 that a good reproduction of the cross-section data is found with the
case 1 results. That result passes through the error bars of most data points. The case
2 cross section has similar structure to the experimental data, but the shape is slightly at
variance falling just outside the error bars associated with a number of the data. The case
3 cross section however is in excellent agreement with most of the experimental data. In
general it falls within most of the data error bars except at the larger scattering angles; the
latter indicative of the phase shifts at integer values of l not being reproduced with suﬃcient
accuracy.

B. The results from semi-classical WKB inversion theory

The WKB inversion results have been obtained by forming the ˜δ(λ) and ˆδ(λ) phase
shift functions and using them to evaluate two quasi-potentials. The potentials that result
are discussed in the ﬁrst subsection. Subsequently we present and discuss the phase shift
reproductions and the cross sections that result on using those inversion potentials.

1. The WKB inversion potentials

The inversion potentials we have found using the semi-classical WKB methods are pre-
sented in Fig. 5. Once again the central potential is shown in the top section of the ﬁgure;
the spin-orbit potential in the bottom. Clearly two very diﬀerent structures have been gen-
erated. The result from using the π-adjusted functions has physically sensible characteristics
but that found using the deﬂection function deﬁned from the original phase shifts does not.
Indeed the inversion procedure based upon the original phase shift set does not lead to a
spin-orbit potential one can identify as anything sensible and so that is not displayed.

The π-adjusted phase shift data sets give smooth monotonic phase shift functions and
hence work well with the WKB scheme. Furthermore it leads to the form of potential
(the continuous lines in Fig. 5) one would expect for the central component of an e-Xe
interaction, i.e. a smooth function which is highly attractive toward the origin and has an
attractive r−4 long range behavior. The spin-orbit component of the potential would also be
small and short ranged. Essentially the potential from this WKB analysis that is displayed
in Fig. 5 has this desired prescription. However, given that the input was not optimally
smooth at large angular momenta (close inspection of the input data showed that there
were small oscillations in the phase shift functions), there are small oscillations at large radii
in the WKB inversion potential. Nevertheless, by smoothing, the long range WKB inversion

11

potential does behave on average like r−4 and the central component of this WKB inversion
potential resembles that found using the N-S scheme.

Only the central potential found from WKB inversion of the original phase shift data [9]
is shown in Fig. 5 (by the long dashed line). Quite evidently it is nonsensical. It exhibits
ambiguous behavior at many radii, resulting from a loss of 1:1 correspondence between σ
and r in this case. Apparently if the input phase shift function contains a large degree of
curvature then that input is unsuitable for use with the WKB procedure. This is emphasized
when one considers the deﬂection function, quasi-potential, and the associated σ vs r plots.
The deﬂection function resulting from diﬀerentiating the phase shift function deﬁned from
interpolation of the original phase shift values, has a rapid variation as is evident from the
top panel in Fig. 6. Consequently the quasi-potential will also be quite structured and that
is shown in the middle panel of Fig. 6. As a result the stability condition breaks down at
a fairly large radius. This condition, the correspondence between σ and r, is displayed in
the bottom section of Fig. 6. Clearly between 3 and 5 a.u. there is an ambiguous relation
with σ and so one ﬁnds ambiguous values of the associated WKB inversion potential in that
region. Indeed one can only hope to ascribe a sensible result with this input to the WKB
inversion for radii then in excess of 4 - 5 a.u.

The realistic e-Xe potentials found by using the π-adjusted phase shift sets and with
both the N-S (case 3) and WKB inversion schemes, are compared in Fig. 7. The potentials
found using the N-S scheme are shown by the solid curves while those found by WKB
inversion are displayed by the ﬁlled circles. The latter are taken to the limit radius at which
the 1:1 correspondence between σ and r is maintained. Overall the (semi-classical) WKB
potentials compare very well with those found using the (full quantal) N-S scheme. Clearly
the central potentials look almost exactly the same. There are diﬀerences between those
two which become apparent when the observables are calculated. On the other hand, the
spin-orbit WKB potential is very smooth and weak in comparison to the corresponding N-S
component. Also it is repulsive at all radii while the N-S potential has a small attractive
well between approximately 0.3 and 0.6 a.u.

2. Reproduction of the phase shifts

Despite the very pleasing form generated for the potential using the WKB scheme, the
reproduction of the phase shifts, although reasonable, is not as good as those generated
using the N-S scheme. However this discrepancy is not disconcerting given that the WKB
scheme is a semi-classical approximation. The phase shifts found from our WKB calculation
are shown by the open circles in Fig. 8, and joining lines have been included solely to guide
the eye. The data of Gibson et al. [9] again are represented by the ﬁlled black circles. As
with the N-S case, part of the discrepancy between the calculated values and the data may
be due to the ambiguity with the interpolation required to specify the phase shift functions
and particularly for points below l = 1 for the j = l − 1
A spline was used to determine the deﬂection function, and that inﬂuences the quasi-
potential and ultimately also the potential. Given that points found from the j = l − 1
2
input set are extrapolated for values of λ < 1
2, ambiguity in those values is inevitable. That
ambiguity persists when these splined values are used to determine the input functions ˜δl(λ)
and ˆδl(λ). That may result in a poor reproduction of the physical phase shifts, particularly

2 input set.

the relevant WKB potentials are found to complete the study loop.

3. The cross section from the WKB inversion potentials

Already, from the reproduction of the phase shifts, we suspect that with the WKB
method, reproduction of the cross section will not be as good as that obtained using the
relevant N-S inversion potentials. This is indeed true. The solid curve shown in Fig. 9 depicts
the WKB cross section result which is compared therein against the Gibson et al. data [9]
and also against the cross section determined by using the preferred case 3 N-S inversion
potential (shown by the dashed curve). We now present the results in a semi-logarithmic
plot since WKB cross section is similar in magnitude to the data, however it does not display
quite the right structure at any scattering angle. The reproduction simply is not as good as
that found using the N-S scheme. This ﬁgure also emphasizes the mismatch of the case 3
N-S inversion results at large angles that we commented on earlier.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Inversion potentials for the 5 eV electron-Xenon atom interaction have been found using
both the full quantal N-S and the semi-classical WKB inverse scattering theories. The
results from application of the N-S inversion were very good. Several inputs were used in
this approach, each containing a diﬀerent number of phase shift values. From solutions
of the Schr¨odinger equations speciﬁed with each of the potentials, ‘inversion’ phase shifts
were extracted that reproduced well the starting (physical) phase shift values and also the
empirical cross section. However, when the input was taken solely to be the (physical) phase
shifts at integer-l values of angular momenta, the inversion potential contains a marked
repulsion at small radii. That is not physical. With increased numbers of input data
speciﬁed at non-integer values of angular momentum, inversion produced a potential with
sensible (physically credible) characteristics.

As two disparate inversion methods ﬁnd central e-Xe potentials that are essentially the
same and have pertinent physical properties of the scattering system, we are conﬁdent that
the N-S approach has (nearly) converged and that the central potential obtained by expanded
π-adjusted physical phase shift sets is the appropriate candidate for the local Schr¨odinger
interaction. The spin-orbit potential is reasonable but more detailed investigations are
needed before the characteristics found for it can be adopted with conﬁdence.

The similarity between the WKB and N-S inversion potentials also implies that the
introduction of unphysical phase shifts in the N-S calculation is essential if a stable inversion
potential is to be obtained in this case. That would be so with other energies measured [9]
and, by implication, for any such electron-atom scattering at eV energies. There is the
diﬃculty however, of accurately specifying the phase shifts for non-integer angular momenta.
Obviously some kind of a priori information regarding the colliding system is necessary. In
this instance simply π-adjusting the given phase shift data suﬃced.

Abstract

Besides the well known Stark resonances, which are localized in the potential well and tunnel

through the potential barrier created by the dc-ﬁeld, “strange” long and short-lived resonances are

analytically obtained. These resonances are not localized inside the potential well. We show that

the narrow ones are localized above the potential well. These narrow resonances give rise to a peak

structure in a 1D scattering experiment. We also show that the broad overlapping resonances are

associated with the static electric ﬁeld potential barrier. These “strange” overlapping resonances

do not give rise to a peak structure in a 1D scattering experiment. We propose a 2D experimental

set-up where in principle these short-lived states should be observed as peaks. Broad overlapping

resonances, associated only with the static electric ﬁeld potential barrier, could also have observable

eﬀects in a N > 1 array of quantum wells in the presence of a truncated static electric ﬁeld. This last

problem is associated with the resonance tunnelling phenomena which are used in the construction

of resonance-tunnelling diodes and transistors.

INTRODUCTION

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the decay processes in mesoscopic as well as

atomic systems is of fundamental importance. Valuable insight into the decay mechanisms

of these systems is obtained when one expresses their dynamical properties in terms of

the resonance states of the system (complex eigenvalues in the lower half energy plane).

Resonances in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld that are directly associated with the

bound or resonance states of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian, known as Stark resonances, are well

understood and studied for many years [1]. Less known and understood are resonances in

the presence of a static electric ﬁeld that can not be traced back to the bound, excited or

resonance states of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian.

A simple model where the later type of resonances appear is the one-dimensional δ-

potential well in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld. For this simple model, Ludvikson

has shown the existence of two families of an inﬁnite number of resonances that can not be

traced back to the bound state of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian [2]. The eﬀect of these families

of resonance states in physically measurable quantities was studied by Emmanouilidou and

Reichl [3]. In this latter study, the authors, using a complex spectral decomposition [4] for

Ludvikson’s one-dimensional model, were able to qualitatively reproduce the main features
of the experimentally obtained photodetachment cross section of the H − ion in the presence

of a static electric ﬁeld when driven by a weak time-periodic electric ﬁeld [5, 6] and directly

associate these features to the two-families of inﬁnite resonance states. More recently, Lud-

vikson’s model was studied in ref[7], and using two-δ potentials in ref[8] in the context of

avoided crossings.

Open questions yet remain regarding the “nature” of these resonance states which do not

stem from the spectrum of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian. In the current work we address some

of these questions using as our model system a one-dimensional square well in the presence

of a static electric ﬁeld. We show that this model potential supports Stark resonances

that are localized inside the square well and tunnel through the potential barrier created

by the dc-ﬁeld. We also ﬁnd two families of inﬁnite resonances that can not be traced

to the spectrum of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian. One family consists of long-lived resonance

2

states that are localized above the potential well, while the other family consists of short-

lived overlapping resonances that are localized below the potential well. Resonance states

similar to the long-lived ones that are not associated with the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian have

been probed as peaks in experiments measuring the photodetachment rate of negative ions

driven by a weak time periodic ﬁeld in the presence of a static ﬁeld [5, 6]. However, little

is known about the “nature” of the short-lived states that are not associated with the ﬁeld-

free Hamiltonian. Since these resonance states do not give rise to a peak structure in a 1D

scattering experiment, it is an open question what is an appropriate experimental set up

where these short-lived overlapping resonances could be probed as peaks.

We shed light into the nature of these resonance states, by showing ﬁrst that they are

associated only with the static electric ﬁeld potential barrier. Next, by introducing a cut-oﬀ

to the static electric ﬁeld we ﬁnd overlapping resonances similar to the broad overlapping

resonances that are present in the case of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld.

In

both cases, with and without the cut-oﬀ, the square well plus static electric ﬁeld supports

overlapping resonances that are only associated with the static electric ﬁeld potential barrier.

Using exterior complex scaling, we show that the overlapping resonances of the truncated

potential have a nodal structure. Future work might involve studying the eﬀect of the long

and short-lived resonances on the transmission properties through an N > 1 array of 1D

quantum wells in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld. This latter problem is associated

with the resonance tunnelling phenomena which are used in the construction of resonance-

tunnelling diodes and transistors. Our results can be perhaps used in the design of a new

type of controlled electronic switches. Finally, we also propose a two-dimensional scattering

set-up where in principle the short-lived states of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld

should give rise to a peak structure. The proposed 2D set-up is based on an idea proposed

by Narevicius and Moiseyev[10] involving a light atom getting trapped among two heavy

ones.

II. MODEL

The model we use describes the behaviour of a single particle, of mass m and charge q,

in one space dimension, in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld and a square well potential.

Note that t′, z′ are the time, and the energy on the complex plane variables, respectively, and

t, z are the corresponding dimensionless variables. The above Hamiltonian has a continuous

energy spectrum in the Hilbert space. One way to obtain the resonance states of the system,

which are given by complex eigenvalues in the lower energy plane, is to obtain the poles of

the analytically continued energy Green’s function in the lower half energy plane. In the

current work, we employ a diﬀerent approach that allows us to ﬁnd the resonance states

of the system in a very simple way.

In this simple approach, the wavefunction satisﬁes

Gamov-Siegert boundary conditions, that is, it satisﬁes outgoing wave boundary conditions:

where Ci+ describes an outgoing wave in the positive x direction in the presence of a static

electric ﬁeld and Ci+ = iAi + Bi. For z in the lower half energy plane, the wavefunction

Ψ(x, z) goes to zero as x

but is not bounded as x

. Thus, due to the outgoing

wave boundary conditions we imposed, Ψ(x, z) is not a square integrable wavefunction.

Using Eq.(8) we ﬁnd the resonances of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld for V0 = 5

and α = 1, shown in Table I, and their corresponding wavefunctions satisfy:

H(x)Ψ(x, zn) = znΨ(x, zn)

with Ψ(x, zn) not an element of the Hilbert space and H(x) being non Hermitian.

III. STARK RESONANCES

The square well plus static electric ﬁeld supports resonance states that stem from the

bound as well as the resonance states of the ﬁeld-free square well. In Table I, the resonances

denoted by 0 and 1 stem from the bound states of the ﬁeld-free square well and in what

(8)

(9)

5

follows we refer to them as type I Stark resonances. Indeed, one can easily show that the

conditions for bound states of the square well in dimensionless units are:

√E +

−

V0 −

q

Etan(

V0 −

q

E)α) = 0

√E +

V0 −

q

Ecot(

V0 −

q

E)α) = 0.

From the above conditions one ﬁnds that for V0 = 5 the square well supports two bound

states, one with even symmetry and value E =

3.8525 and one with odd symmetry and

−

value E =

0.9314. These energies are very close to the real part of the resonances 0 and

−
1, respectively, in Table I.

In addition to the type I Stark resonances, the square well plus static electric ﬁeld supports

resonance states (type II Stark resonances) that stem from the resonance states of the ﬁeld-

free square well. When computing the transmission probability for the one-dimensional

ﬁeld-free square well one ﬁnds peaks for energies equal to the real part of the resonance

states. The ﬁeld-free square well supports resonance states [9] whose real part is given by:

ER,l = (

lπ
2α

)2

V0,

−

(10)

where ( lπ

2α)2 with l = 1, 2, ... are the energy levels of an inﬁnite square well that extends from
α to α. Using Eq.(10), we ﬁnd that for V0 = 5 the lowest resonance state of the ﬁeld-free

−
square well has a real part that is given by ER,2 = 4.8696. Note, that this energy is close to

the real part of the resonance state denoted by n = 3 in Table I.

In Fig.(1), we plot the absolute value of the resonance wavefunctions Ψn(x) as a function

of the one-dimension x. The normalization constant in Eq.(7) is evaluated so that

Using this deﬁnition of norm the wavefunctions corresponding to diﬀerent resonances are

orthogonal, for more details on using this norm see ref[11]. The Stark resonances of the

square well plus static electric ﬁeld are localized inside the potential well and exhibit a

nodal structure. Note that in order for one to see the antinode-node structure one would

have to plot separately the real and the imaginary part of the wavefunction. In the current

work we plot the absolute value of the wavefunction and that is the reason why only the

maxima of the wavefunction are exposed. For brevity we refer to this structure as nodal.

This can be clearly seen for the type I Stark resonances that are plotted in Fig.(1). Less clear

6

is the nodal pattern of the type II Stark resonance z3 due to its interference with the long-

lived resonance states stemming from the continuum that are localized above the barrier, as

we discuss in the following section. A comparison with Fig.(2) reveals that the resonance

state z3 has a nodal pattern with two maxima inside the square well since z3 seems to be

associated with the ER,2 resonance state of the ﬁeld-free square well. A more detailed study

of the resonance dependence with the strength of the static electric ﬁeld would determine

beyond doubt the resonance states in Table I that are associated with the resonances in the

ﬁeld-free square well.

IV. “NEW-BORN” RESONANCE STATES THAT ARE NOT ASSOCIATED

WITH THE POLES OF THE FIELD-FREE POTENTIAL WELL.

In addition to the Stark resonances, the square well plus static electric ﬁeld supports

resonance states that can not be traced back to the bound or resonance state poles of the

ﬁeld-free square well. We refer to these resonance states as “new-born” states. There are

two families of an inﬁnite number of these resonance states with one family consisting of

long-lived states and the other one consisting of short-lived ones.

A.

Long-lived “new-born” above-well resonance states

For V0 = 5 and α = 1, the family of long-lived states stemming from the continuum
are the z2, z4, z5, ... resonances in Table I. Using Eq.(8), one can show that when V0 → ∞
the family of the long-lived resonance states stemming from the continuum are given by

−

Ai(α

E) = 0 [2]. That is, to the lowest order in 1/V, the real part of these long-lived

3π/8 + 3lπ/2)2/3, with l = 1, 2, .... In Table II we show the real part

states is given by α + (
−
of the ﬁrst eight long-lived states when V0 → ∞
ﬁnd the resonance states corresponds to a deep potential well. A comparison of Table I and

. The value of V0 = 5 and α = 1 we use to

Table II reveals that the real part of the resonance states zn with n

6 is very similar to

≥

the energies in Table II with l > 4. The resonance states z2, z4 and z5, in Table I, have a

real part not as close to the energies corresponding to l = 1, 2 and l = 3 in Table II, due to

the interference of the family of the long-lived resonance states with the z3 Stark resonance.

When the square well becomes very deep the family of the long-lived resonance states are

7

very close to the eigenstates of the triangular well that is formed by the static electric ﬁeld

in the region x <

α and a wall at x =

α. In Fig.(1) we see that the long-lived states,

−

−

denoted by the dashed curves in Fig.(1), are localized above the barrier and have a nodal

structure inside the triangular well. Due to the interference with the z3 Stark resonance,

the nodal pattern of the family of long-lived states has also a nodal structure consisting of

two maxima in the region where the square well extends. Long-lived “new born” resonance

states similar to the ones currently under consideration have been known to give rise to

a peak structure in photodetachment experiments of negative ions driven by a weak-time

periodic ﬁeld in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld [5, 6].

In support of our statement that there is interference between the family of long-lived

resonance states and the type II Stark resonances we include Figs.(2) and (3).

In these

Figures, we plot the absolute value of the wavefunction z1 and z6 shown in Table III, as a

function of the one-dimension x for V0 = 30. Using Eq.(10) one ﬁnds that the lowest type

II Stark resonance of the ﬁeld-free square well is ER,4 = 9.478, for V0 = 30. The Stark

resonance z6 in Table III stems from the ER,4 state. In Fig.(2) we see that

Ψz6(x)

has a

|

|

nodal structure with four pronounced maxima in the region where the square well extends,

since it stems from the ER,4 resonance state of the ﬁeld-free square well. In addition, the

nodal pattern of

Ψz6(x)

involves 6 maxima localized in the triangular region above the

|

|

square well indicating interference with the family of long-lived states. In Fig.(3) we plot

Ψz1(x)

and we see that it has one pronounced maximum inside the triangular region above

|

|
the square well as well as four less pronounced ones for

α < x < α due to the interference

−

with the z6 Stark resonance.

B. Short-lived “new-born” potential-barrier resonance states

The square well potential plus static electric ﬁeld supports in addition to the resonances

studied in the previous sections, a family of an inﬁnite number of short-lived resonance

states that are stemming from the continuum. For V0 = 5, these resonance states are

denoted as z−1, z−2, ... in Table I. These short-lived states are overlapping resonances, that
is, the spacing of the real energy part is less than the width of these states. When V0 → ∞
α) = 0 [2]. That is, to
one can show that the condition for obtaining these states is Ci(

the lowest order in 1/V, these short-lived states are given by (

zn −
−
3π/8 + 3lπ/2)2/3e−i2π/3

−

α,

−

8

with l = 1, 2, ....

Understanding the “nature” of these broad resonances is harder than understanding the

“nature” of the long-lived ones for the following reasons. First, in the limit V0 becomes

very large, the real part of the long-lived states are the eigenenergies of the triangular well

formed by the static electric ﬁeld for x <

α and a wall at x =

α, as discussed in

−
section IVA, see also ref [3] and references there in. The fact that the long-lived “new-born”

−

states are localized above the square well and primarily in the above mentioned triangular

region is also corroborated by the nodal structure of these states shown in Fig.(1). It is

not known, however, what part of the potential are the short-lived states associated with.

The fact that these resonance states do not have a nodal structure, see Fig.(1), does not

make it evident what part of the potential these states are associated with. Second, in a 1D

scattering experiment, that one measures, for example, the wigner delay time as a function

of the incident energy one ﬁnds peaks for energies equal to the real energy of the long-lived

states but one does not ﬁnd a peak structure for the broad overlapping resonances [3]. In

photodetachment experiments of negative ions driven by a week time periodic ﬁeld in the

presence of a static electric ﬁeld [5, 6], the long-lived states are known to give rise to a

peak structure [5, 6] while the short-lived ones do not. These latter ones however have been

shown to have observable eﬀects in the photodetachment rate of the negative ions when

driven by a weak time periodic ﬁeld in the presence of a static ﬁeld [3]. Mainly, the short-

lived resonance states stemming from the continuum of the δ-potential plus static electric

ﬁeld [2] have been shown to be responsible for the asymmetry of the peaks as well as the

considerable photodetachment rate for photon energies smaller than the binding energy of
the loosely bound electron of the H − ion, that is experimentally observed as a “shoulder”

structure.

It is thus of interest to elucidate the “nature” of the short-lived resonances and suggest

a possible experimental set up where they could give rise to peaks as is the case for the

long-lived “new-born” resonances. To do so, we ﬁrst show that the short-lived states are

associated only with the static electric ﬁeld potential barrier. Then, by introducing a cut-oﬀ

and thus truncating the static electric ﬁeld, we ﬁnd broad overlapping resonances, that are

again associated only with the static electric ﬁeld potential barrier. Using complex scaling,

we show that the nodal structure is hidden under the natural exponential divergent nature

of these broad resonance states. Lastly, we discuss a 2D scattering set-up where the broad

9

(12)

(13)

(14)

resonances of the square well plus static ﬁeld should in principle give rise to peaks.

1. Potential barrier resonances

In what follows, we show that the short-lived overlapping resonance states stemming from

the continuum are associated only with the potential barrier formed by the static electric ﬁeld

for x > α, see Fig.(4). We take the potential barrier to be

V (x) = 




V0 −
−
x,
−

α, x < α

x > α

To ﬁnd the resonance states of the potential barrier we follow the same approach as in

section II, that is, we ﬁnd the wavefunction satisfying outgoing wave boundary conditions

which is found to be:

where k = √V0 + α + z. From the continuity of the wavefunction and its ﬁrst derivative at

x = α we obtain the condition for resonance states:

. We ﬁnd that the potential barrier,

supports a family of an inﬁnite number of short-lived resonance states. These states are

given in Table IV, and a comparison with Table I reveals that they are almost identical with

the short-lived states of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld.

The one-dimensional symmetric and nonsymmetric Eckart potential barrier are smooth

barriers that support short-lived overlapping states, as has been shown by Ryaboy and

Moiseyev [12].

In ref[12], it was shown that after complex scaling, the wavefunctions of

these short-lived states are localized inside the potential barrier and have a nodal structure.

It is also interesting to note that in contrast to the sharp edges of the potential barrier

currently under consideration the Eckart barrier is a smooth potential. We believe that this

latter fact suggests that the existence of the short-lived resonance states of the square well

plus static electric ﬁeld is not due to the sharp edges of this potential.

10

So far, we have shown, that the short-lived overlapping resonance states of the one-

dimensional square well plus static electric ﬁeld are eigenstates of the static electric ﬁeld

potential barrier, as is the case for the Eckart potential-barrier resonances. However, unlike

the Eckart potential-barrier resonances the short-lived overlapping resonances of the square

well plus static electric ﬁeld do not have a nodal structure, as we have shown. In the next

section, we show that by truncating the static electric ﬁeld one ﬁnds a nodal structure for

overlapping resonances associated only with the static ﬁeld potential barrier.

2. Square well plus static electric ﬁeld with cut-oﬀ

In what follows, we truncate the static electric ﬁeld by introducing a cut-oﬀ. We ﬁnd

that the square well plus the truncated static electric ﬁeld supports, in addition to other

resonances, broad overlapping ones which are again associated only with the static electric

ﬁeld potential barrier and they are thus similar in nature with the broad overlapping res-

onances of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld. Using, complex scaling we show that

the overlapping resonances that are associated with the truncated potential barrier have a

nodal structure. This suggests that it can be the case that the broad overlapping resonances

can have observable eﬀects in the transmission properties of this 1D truncated potential. It

would be of interest in the future to study the eﬀect of the potential barrier resonances on

the transmission properties of the truncated 1D system with N > 1 quantum wells.

In the same way as in the previous section, one can show that the resonance states denoted

by b in Table V are almost identical to the resonance states supported by the potential barrier

formed by the static electric ﬁeld with a cut-oﬀ. By introducing a cut-oﬀ the lifetime of the

short-lived states of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld increases but they are still

overlapping resonances, see states z−1, z−2, ... in Table V. We next apply exterior complex

In Fig.(6) we show that the complex scaled wavefunctions of the overlapping resonances

z−1, z−2, ... have a nodal structure which is explored due to the use of the exterior scaling

transformation. For an explanation of the complex scaling transformations including the

reason we do not take the complex conjugate of the “bra” state when we calculate expecta-

tion values, as is usually done when the conventional scalar product is applied, see Ref.[13].

As it is shown in Fig.(6), the complex scaled wavefunction of the states z−17, z−16, ..., z−9

have a nodal structure with 1,2,...,10 maxima respectively. In Fig.(5) we can see the nodal

structure of the states z−1, z−2, z−3, z−4, z−5 with 18,17,16,15,14 maxima respectively. This

nodal pattern, if

Ψ(x)e−ikx)

|

|

is shifted by the real part of the resonance, is localized in the

region formed by the static electric ﬁeld for x > α and a wall at x = x0. Therefore, the

states are not localized inside the potential barrier as in the Eckart potential case but over

the barrier. Note, however, that these resonances are still considered as potential-barrier

resonances since they “pop up” only when the potential barrier appears and even in the

absence of the ﬁeld-free square potential well. In Fig.(7) we plot the states z2b, z3b, z4b, z6b, z8b

12

which also have a nodal pattern with 19,20,21,22,23 maxima and when shifted by the real

part of the energy seem to be localized between α and x0 above the well.

We have thus shown in this section that the states indicated by b in Table V are eigen-

states of the potential barrier with a cut-oﬀ, are localized over the barrier, and deﬁnitely

not inside the potential well, and have a nodal structure.

As we have already mentioned, it might be interesting to study in the future the eﬀect

of the long-lived as well as of the overlapping “new born” resonances in a 1D scattering

experiment with N > 1 quantum wells in the presence of a static ﬁeld with a cut-oﬀ. If for

example one considers two quantum wells plus a static ﬁeld with a cut-oﬀ, see Fig.(8), one

could consider an initial wavefunction localized in one of the quantum wells and compute

the probability for this wavefunction to tunnel to the region with constant potential, that

is, to the region with x > x0. The long-lived “new born” resonances should be observable

as “peaks” in the transmission probability when plotted as a function of energy but it also

might be the case that the overlapping “new born” resonances aﬀect, in some observable

way, the transmission probability as well.

C. 2D experimental setup

Finally, we propose a two-dimensional (2D) experimental set up where the short-lived

overlapping resonances of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld (without a cut-oﬀ), that

were studied in section IVB1, should in principle give rise to a peak structure. Our proposed

2D set-up is based on an idea by Narevicius and Moiseyev [10]. In ref[10] the short-lived

resonance states of the 1D Eckart potential [12] which are localized in a classically inacces-

sible region have been considered. It has been shown that these resonances become a very

good approximation for 2D resonance states that do yield a peak structure and are localized

in a classically accessible region. That idea is based on the trapping of a light atom between

two heavy ones. The motion of the light atom along the coordinate x perpendicular to the

distance y(x) between the heavy atoms is treated as the slow one. This is a reasonable

approximation if it is for the light particle to get temporarily trapped between the heavy

atoms. In this adiabatic approximation the eigenenergies along the y(x) direction become

the adiabatic potentials along the x direction, which in the case of ref[10] is the 1D Eckart

potential.

13

Given the above idea we propose the following 2D potential to observe the short lived

resonance states of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld: The electrons move “freely” in a

2D quantum well/dot that has the shape shown in Fig.(9). This 2D potential is associated

with a y(x) which is given by,

y(x) =

1/√+x + ∆0 + V0,

α < x < α

The motion of the electrons along the y(x) direction is much faster than the motion along

the x direction. Therefore the adiabatic approach is applicable here as in the case studied

before when a light atom is scattered from two heavy ones. The eigenenergy of the light

particle along the y(x) direction is the ground state of a particle in a box. This eigenenergy

is also the adiabatic potential along the x direction which we take it to be the square well

plus static electric ﬁeld. For a particle in a box the ground state energy is given by

E0 =

π2/(4y(x)2).

−

We design our proposed experiment such that y(x) is given by y(x) = π/(2

E0 being the ground state of the square well which in our case is given by the potential in

Eq.(6) shifted downwards by ∆0. The downward shift introduces a cut-oﬀ for x <

∆0 such

that on one hand it does not aﬀect the short-lived states and on the other it allows for a

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, using a simple model, a square well in the presence of a static electric

ﬁeld we have shown that, besides the Stark resonances, there are two-families of resonances

that are not associated with the spectrum of the ﬁeld-free potential. One family consists

of long-lived states that are localized above the square well. The other family consists of

short-lived overlapping resonances that in a 1D scattering experiment do not give rise to a

peak structure. We have shown that these short-lived resonance states are associated with

the potential barrier. By introducing a cut-oﬀ in the square well plus static electric ﬁeld

we have found again overlapping resonances which are associated only with the static ﬁeld

potential barrier and that have nodal structure. Future studies could involve studying the

14

eﬀects of these potential barrier resonances on the transmission properties of the truncated

1D potential with N > 1 wells. Finally, we have proposed a 2D scattering experiment where

in principle the short-lived resonance states of the square well plus static electric ﬁeld should

yield a peak structure.

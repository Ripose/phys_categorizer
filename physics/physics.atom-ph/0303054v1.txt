Abstract
We account for the diﬀerent symmetries of the 21,3S helium excited states in a quasiclassical

description of the knockout mechanism augmented by a quantum shakeoﬀ contribution. We are

thus able to formulate the separate contribution of the knockout and shakeoﬀ mechanisms for

double photoionization for any excess energy from the 21,3S states. Photoionization ratios and

singly diﬀerential cross sections calculated for the 21,3S excited states of helium are found to be in

very good agreement with recent theoretical results.

A two electron transition in an atom after the absorption of a single photon is only possible

due to electron-electron correlations. The study of two electron transitions in helium, the

simplest atomic target with two electrons, probes the role of electron-electron correlations

in their purest form. As a result, there has been an extensive amount of experimental and

theoretical studies of double photoionization from the ground state of the helium atom.

In addition to the role of electron-electron correlations, the study of two electron escape
by a single photon absorption from the singlet, 21S, and triplet, 23S, excited states of helium

probes the role of symmetry in the two electron dynamics. This is particularly important for

quasiclassical approximations where symmetries and quantum interferences are diﬃcult to

include. With the exception of a few earlier studies in the high energy limit [1, 2], it is only
recently that the study of double photoionization from the 21,3S excited states of helium has

attracted considerable theoretical interest. Experimental measurements of photon absorp-

tion cross sections from the helium excited states still remain a challenge. In these recent

studies sophisticated fully numerical ab-initio methods namely the R-matrix method [3] and

the convergent close-coupling method [4] are used to compute integral double ionization

cross sections, double to single ratios, and only very recently, single and triple diﬀeren-

tial cross sections as well [5]. However, due to the numerical nature of these sophisticated

ab-initio calculations approximate methods are also essential in uncovering the underlying

mechanism of the two electron dynamics in the double escape process. Such approximate

methods have been successfully developed for the double photoionization from the helium

ground state [6, 7]. The current work focuses on an approximate method to describe double

photoionization from the helium excited states.

In the double photoionization process the redistribution of the energy, following the pho-

ton absorption, is often discussed in terms of two mechanisms, that is, knockout and shakeoﬀ

dominant in the low and high energy limit, respectively. In the knockout mechanism one

electron, the primary, absorbs the photon and undergoes a hard collision with the secondary

electron, thus, knocking it out of the atom. The knockout mechanism dominates at low

energies where the interaction time of the two electrons is large and can be described clas-

sically [6, 8]. For knockout, electron correlations are essential in the ﬁnal continuum state.

On the other hand, in the shakeoﬀ mechanism the primary electron absorbs the photon

and leaves the atom very fast without undergoing a direct interaction with the secondary

electron. The secondary electron feels the sudden change in the atomic ﬁeld and relaxes in

2

one of the bound or continuum eigenstates of the remaining ion. The shakeoﬀ mechanism

is quantum mechanical in nature and prevails at high energies where the interaction time

of the two electrons is short. For shakeoﬀ, electron correlations are important in the initial

state before the photon is absorbed.

In the following, we formulate the explicit but separate contribution of both mechanisms
for double photoionization from the 21,3S helium excited states for any excess energy by

extending the model developed to separate the contribution of both mechanisms for the

helium ground state in ref.[6]. The separation is achieved by a quasiclassical formulation

of the knockout process. By construction it is free from any shakeoﬀ contribution which is

purely quantum mechanical. This separation not only facilitates the calculation of double

photoionization but oﬀers considerable insight into the process concerning for example the
similarity with electron impact ionization of He+. Compared to the ground state, formulat-

ing the separate contribution of both mechanisms from the helium excited states is a much
harder problem since the diﬀerent symmetry of the 21,3S states has to be accounted for in

the model.

We express the two steps of the double photoionization process from the helium excited

states, absorption of the photon and afterwards redistribution of the energy, as

X = σabsP ++
σ++
X ,

(1)

where X stands for either knockout or shakeoﬀ and P ++

probability.

In what follows we discuss how to obtain P ++

X is the double electron ionization
SO for the 21,3S

KO and then P ++

helium states.

-Knockout mechanism- After the photon absorption by the primary electron, we describe

the subsequent evolution of the two electrons using the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo

(CTMC) phase space method. CTMC has been successfully used to describe charged particle

impact processes [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. We model the initial phase space of the trajectories

quantum mechanically using a Wigner distribution [14]. To do so, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the initial two-

electron wavefunction. Since electron correlations are not important in the initial state of the

knockout mechanism, we choose our initial state as the independent electron wavefunction

Ψ0(r1, r2) = φZ1s

1s (r1)φZ2s

2s (r2),

(2)

where φZ1s

1s (r1) = (Z 3

2s/(8π))1/2(1 − Z2sr2/2)e−Z2sr2/2 are
hydrogenic 1s and 2s orbitals with eﬀective charges Z1s and Z2s, respectively. Ψ0(r1, r2)

1s/π)1/2e−Z1sr1 and φZ2s

2s (r2) = (Z 3

3

given by Eq.(2) is not a symmetrized wavefunction, thus, we do not yet account for the
diﬀerent symmetries of the triplet 23S and the singlet 21S helium excited states. To ﬁnd
the eﬀective charges Z1s and Z2s we use the two-electron ionization energies I ++
21S/23S ≈
2.146/2.175 for the 21S/23S states given in ref.[2], and the ionization energies of the 1s and

2s orbitals as follows. The energy needed to remove the 1s electron after the 2s electron has
been ionized is 2 a.u. and thus from I1s = Z 2
and the singlet states. From I ++
2s/8 we ﬁnd Z2s ≈ 1.081/1.184 for the
21S/23S states, respectively. Atomic units are used throughout this paper unless otherwise

1s/2 = 2 we ﬁnd Z1s = 2 for both the triplet

21S/23S − I1s = I2s = Z 2

indicated.

While, for the 1s2 helium ground state the photon is necessarily absorbed by a 1s electron,
for the 1s2s conﬁguration of the 21,3S helium states the photon can be absorbed by a 1s or a

2s electron. For the values of the eﬀective charges given above, one can show that the cross

section is much larger for photon absorption from a 1s electron rather than a 2s electron

using the independent electron picture [16]. Therefore, we take the primary electron to be

the one on the 1s orbital. With the PEAK approximation, exact in the high photon energy

limit [15], we assume that the photon absorption happens directly at the nucleus. This

signiﬁcantly reduces the initial phase space to be sampled by the CTMC method.

The initial phase space distribution, ρ(Γ), is the two electron density immediately after

the photon absorption given by

ρ(Γ) = Nδ(r1)ρ2(r2, p2),

(3)

(4)

where N is a normalization constant. The initial distribution of the primary electron is δ(r1)

(PEAK approximation) while that of the secondary electron is given by

ρ2(r2, p2) = Wψ(r2, p2)δ(ǫin

2 − ǫB),

where Wψ(r2, p2) is the Wigner distribution function of the two electron wavefunction with

the primary electron at the nucleus, r1 = 0,

ψ(r2) = Ψ0(r1 = 0, r2)(hΨ0(r1 = 0, r2)|Ψ0(r1 = 0, r2)i)−1/2.

(5)

In Eq.(4), we take the energy of the secondary electron immediately after photon absorption,
2 , to be ﬁxed on the 2s energy shell ǫB = −Z 2
ǫin
p2
2/2−Z2s/r2. The excess energy available to the two electron system after photon absorption

2s/8. From Eq.(2), it follows that ǫin

2 =

4

is determined by the photon energy to be

E = ω − I ++

21S, E = ω − I ++
23S

(6)

for the 21S and 23S states, respectively. Due to the PEAK approximation the primary

electron can have any energy necessary so that together with the initial energy ǫin

2 of the

secondary electron it adds up to the excess energy E in Eq.(6). After modelling the initial

phase space distribution, we propagate the electron trajectories using the classical equations

of motion (CTMC). Regularized coordinates [17] are used for the propagation of the electron

trajectories to avoid problems with trajectories starting at the nucleus (r1 = 0). Doubly

ionized are those trajectories that end with the asymptotic energies of both electrons being

positive. To evaluate the double electron escape probability each trajectory is weighted by

the initial phase space Wigner distribution.

So far we have treated the two electrons as distinguishable particles, that is, we dis-

tinguish between the primary and the secondary electron. To account for the singlet and

triplet symmetries we have to symmetrize the probability amplitude (diﬀerential probability)

In Eq.(7), dP ++

KO(ǫ, E)/dǫ is the probability for both electrons to escape when the primary

electron is ejected with energy ǫ, where 0 ≤ ǫ ≤ E, and the secondary electron is ejected
with energy E − ǫ. To evaluate dP ++

KO(ǫ, E)/dǫ we divide the energy interval [0, ǫ] into N

equally sized bins and ﬁnd the doubly ionized trajectories which fall into the bins. In our

calculations we take N = 21 for excess energies up to 80 eV and N = 27 for higher excess
energies. The double ionization probability P ++

KO is obtained by integrating over all possible

worked out without using the diﬀerential probabilities [6].

-Shakeoﬀ mechanism- Assuming that the primary electron is suddenly removed from the

atom, Aberg [18] found that the probability for the shaken (secondary) electron to relax on

5

a hydrogenic eigenstate of the remaining ion for any excess energy is

α = |hφα|ψνi|2/hψν|φνi,
P ν

(9)

where ψν(r2) =

d3r1ν∗(r1)Ψ0(r1, r2) and ν(r1) is the primary electron wavefunction after

it has left the atom. The primary electron is in an s state before the photon absorption and
in a p state afterwards. Ψ0(r1, r2) is the initial state wavefuntion of the 21,3S helium excited

R

states and φα is a hydrogenic eigenstate of the bare nucleus (Z = 2) that is either a bound

(α = n) or a continuum state (α = ǫ). Aberg [18] has further shown that when the primary
electron leaves the atom with very high energy (ν(r1) = (2π)−3/2e−ik1r1) Eq.(9) takes the

simpliﬁed form

function.

.

Eq.(10) reveals the quantum mechanical nature of the shakeoﬀ process since it is expressed

as an overlap of the initial bound state wavefunction and the ﬁnal continuum state wave-

Although Eq.(10) was derived in the high energy limit we assume that the primary

electron absorbs the photon on the nucleus for all excess energies, that is, we adopt the
PEAK approximation as in the knockout case. To ﬁnd the double escape probability P ++

for the singlet and triplet states, respectively, with N1 a normalization constant. The initial

state correlations are accounted for only through the eﬀective charges. We next assign the
same set of eﬀective charges Z 1

SO for both the triplet and the singlet states as

SO and Z 2

follows. The asymptotic ratio (high energy limit) of double to single ionization is found very

accurately in ref.[2] to be R∞ = 0.009033/0.003118 for the singlet/triplet states where in

our model R∞ is given by

R∞ = P ++

Using Eqs.(13), (14) and the symmetrized wavefunctions in Eq.(12) we ﬁnd the sets of

charges that match both asymptotic ratios R∞ for the singlet and the triplet states. We

then select that set of charges for which the shakeoﬀ double ionization probability as a

function of the excess energy, obtained using the simple wavefunctions given in Eq.(12), is

closest to the one obtained using the fully correlated Hylleraas wavefunctions given in ref.[19].
SO ≈ 1.757 and Z 2
The set of charges thus found is Z 1
the Hylleraas wavefunctions given in ref.[19] is that they do not reproduce the accurate

SO ≈ 1.728. The reason we do not use

asymptotic ratios obtained in ref.[2] using highly accurate Pekeris-type wavefunctions. We

emphasise though that one does not need to use the approximate wavefunctions in Eq.(12)

to compute the double ionization probability; highly accurate wavefunctions that reproduce

the correct asymptotic ratios could be used instead.

For the shakeoﬀ probability, Pǫ in Eq.(10) already gives the diﬀerential double ionization

probability. Despite the symmetrization in Eq.(12) we have lost the indistinguishability of

the electrons by identifying one electron as the primary one which absorbs the photon. Thus

we need to symmetrize again in the ﬁnal state with respect to the equal energy sharing point

ǫ = E − ǫ = E/2 [6]. That is,

-Photoionization ratios-. According to Eq.(1) σ++ = σabs(P ++

KO + P ++

SO ) and σ+ = σabs −

σ++. Thus, the double to single ionization ratio is given by

σ++/σ+ = P ++/(1 − P ++),

(15)

(16)

where P ++ = P ++

SO . In ﬁgure (1) we compare the double to single ratio for the 21,3S
helium excited states with the results obtained by Kheifets et al [4] using the convergent

KO + P ++

close-coupling method and show that there is a very good agreement. The agreement is
better for the 23S state. We ﬁnd that the deviation occurs, particularly for the 23S state, at

photon energies where the contribution of knockout and shakeoﬀ mechanisms is comparable.

At these energies any interference eﬀect between the knockout and shakeoﬀ mechanism would

have its largest eﬀect. So, it may be that the deviations we see are due to that interference

eﬀect that we do not account for in our calculation, since we add the knockout and shakeoﬀ

7

contributions incoherently. For the 21S state a maximum of ≈ 2.84 % is reached at 14 eV
above the double ionization threshold of the 21S state. For the 23S state a maximum of ≈
0.69 % is reached at 60 eV above the ionization threshold of the 23S state. In ﬁgure (1)

we see that at high energies the knockout contribution goes to zero as expected and the

shakeoﬀ contribution dominates and reaches the asymptotic limit of 0.009033/0.003118 for

the singlet/triplet states. Stronger correlation eﬀects for the singlet symmetry (r1 = r2 is not

forbidden as is the case for the triplet) result in a much higher double to single ionization
ratio compared to the triplet case. From ﬁgure (1), for the 21,3S states, and ref.[6], for
the helium ground state 1S, we see that as we go from 1S → 21S → 23S the shakeoﬀ

mechanism overtakes the knockout mechanism at smaller energies. The reason is that the

electron-electron correlation becomes smaller, thus diminishing the knockout contribution

and favouring the shakeoﬀ mechanism at even smaller energies.

-Single diﬀerentials- To compute the single diﬀerential probabilities for the helium excited

states we use

In addition we compute the single diﬀerential cross sections using

(17)

(18)

where for σabs we use the results for the total-photoionization cross section for the 21S and
the 23S states given in ref.[4]. In ﬁgure (2) we compare our results for dσ++/dǫ with the

results obtained very recently by Colgan et al [5] using the convergent close-coupling method

for four values of the excess energy. We see that our results for the single diﬀerential cross

section as a function of the ejected electron energy normalized by the excess energy are
smaller for the 21S state while there is an excellent agreement for the 23S state. Again as
we go from 1S → 21S → 23S the single diﬀerential cross sections are more U-shaped for the

same excess energy. The reason is again that the electron-electron correlation decreases thus

favouring the ejection of one fast and one slow electron, that is favouring unequal energy

sharing.

In ﬁgure (3) we show the separate contribution of knockout and shakeoﬀ to the single
diﬀerential probabilities for the 21,3S helium states for excess energies 10 eV, 40 eV and 160

eV. For the singlet state the knockout contribution dominates at small excess energies, 10 eV

and 40 eV, while as the excess energy is increased to 160 eV the shakeoﬀ contribution begins

8

to dominate regions of unequal energy sharing. For the triplet case the shakeoﬀ mechanism

is already signiﬁcant at small excess energies. Note, that the knockout contribution for the

triplet case is zero at the equal energy sharing point, ǫ = E−ǫ, because of the symmetrization

with respect to the two identical electrons, see Eq.(7).

In conclusion we have shown that the double ionization from the 21,3S states can be

accurately described by a separate formulation and calculation of the knockout and shakeoﬀ

mechanism at any excess energy.

In comparison to the helium ground state [6] this is a

harder problem because we have to account for the diﬀerent symmetries of the singlet and

triplet states. The success of this simple model to describe double ionization from the helium

ground state as well as the helium excited states is proof for its validity. In the future, we

plan to use this simple model to describe triple photoionization cross sections.

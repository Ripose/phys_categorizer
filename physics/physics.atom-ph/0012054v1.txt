Method for Precision Test of Fine Structure Constant Variation with Optical
Frequency References

(February 16, 2014)

A test of the possible variation in space-time of the ﬁne structure constant by comparing In+ and
Tl+ optical frequency references is proposed. The ions would be conﬁned in a linear trap spaced by
about 20 µm and the frequency comparison would be realized using an optical stabilization transfer
−18/τ can be approached with this method, where τ is the time over
cavity. The limit of ˙α/α ∼ 10
which the frequency references are compared. A near-term goal of ˙α/α ∼ 10

−15/yr is realistic.

The notion that our physical description of nature is
incomplete can be supported with empirical evidence.
Two examples relevant to the ideas presented in this
manuscript are: 1) the set of constants termed ‘funda-
mental’ are more numerous than, and hence overdeﬁne
the absolute scales of length, mass, electric charge, etc.,
and 2) we have no veriﬁed theory that uniﬁes gravity
with the other basic forces.

Dirac was one of the ﬁrst workers to suggest a possi-
ble relationship between gravity and other fundamental
forces [1]. From our overdeﬁned set of fundamental con-
stants, he deﬁned certain dimensionless numbers that he
believed to have special importance. For instance, he
noticed that the magnitude of the ratio of electrostatic
and gravitational forces in hydrogen was similar to the
magnitude of the ratio of the age of the universe and the
transit time of light across the classical electron radius
(1039 vs. 1040), and suggested they were related. Hence,
the quantity (e2/Gmemp)
(α/G), where α is the ﬁne
∝
structure constant and G is the gravitational constant,
was hypothesized to change with time. This notion was
furthered when others [2] showed that ln(λ2
α
where λe/LP = (¯h/mec)/p¯hG/c3 is the ratio the electron
Compton wavelength and the Planck length. If this rela-
tionship is invariant, it provides a constraint on relative
changes in α and G.

Several attempts to unify the fundamental forces have
suggested the existence of additional, compact spatial
dimensions whose size may be measured on a scale as
small as the Planck scale. These theories are still in their
infancy. However, it is hypothesized that cosmological
evolution on the mean scale of these additional dimen-
sions will cause a space-time variation of fundamental
constants deﬁned in four dimensions [3–6]. Of the most
notable parameters of interest in this case are dimension-
less gauge coupling constants such as α, αw = m2
wGF ,
αs = g2
s , the ﬁne structure constant, and weak and strong
coupling constants respectively.

Other theories have also hypothesized space-time vari-
ations of constants. For instance, Carroll [7] has sug-
gested that a scalar ﬁeld might exist that would couple to
the Maxwell pseudoscalar Fµν ˜F µν, perhaps eliminating
the need for a cosmological constant, but necessitating α

variation.

Measuring a variation or setting tight limits on a pos-
sible variation of a fundamental constant is a sensitive
test of physics beyond our current knowledge. Although
a measured variation does not necessarily disprove long-
standing theories such a general relativity, quantum elec-
trodynamics and others, it would be evidence of deeper
structure in nature.

A number of workers have derived limits for the time
variation of the ﬁne structure constant ( ˙α) [8–14]. These
sources of information can be divided into two categories:
observations and measurements. Currently the most con-
straining limits for ˙α come from observational data. The
ﬁrst result reported in Table I was obtained from analy-
sis of the natural ﬁssion reaction that took place in Oklo,
109 years ago . The next two results were
Gabon about 2
·
obtained through analysis of astrophysical data . The ﬁ-
nal two numbers are results of laboratory measurements
of relative shifts between microwave time standards and
between a microwave standard and a superconducting
cavity stabilized oscillator .

The observational methods have the advantage of an
averaging time measured in billions of years when search-
ing for a linear drift in α. This advantage combined with
the ability to look for both ancient and large-scale spatial
variation in α make the observational methods valuable
for the future of this research. However, these methods
are not without diﬃculties. Most importantly, the in-
terpretation of these data is model dependent [9] and the
data may have been altered by unknown mechanisms [11].
While laboratory measurements do not have the ad-
vantage of 109 years over which to integrate, there are
several beneﬁts oﬀered by such an approach. These mea-
surements can be made in a carefully prepared environ-
ment and are reproducible. They have the additional
beneﬁt of being sensitive to both the present-day value
of α and oscillations that might leave the integrated value
of α unchanged over cosmic time scales.

The two laboratory measurements that led to the lim-
its reported in Table I compared microwave time stan-
dards to derive their respective limits. Table II illus-
trates the current status of various time standards in ex-
istence today. By comparing these standards, a limit on

the integrated change in α over the measurement time
can be determined that is on the order of, but not better
than, the fractional stability of the least precise of the two
standards being compared [9,13–15]. For the standards
shown in Table II, the current limit for ˙α/α could see an
improvement of an order of magnitude in the forseeable
future. However, it is likely that improvements on this
limit will be constrained by magnetic ﬁeld shifts or cold
collisions. Another promising possibility is to compare
the optical frequencies of references stabilized to narrow
transition in In+ and Tl+.

Calculations were made recently of the relativistic en-
ergy level corrections as an expansion in powers of α for
various atomic ions including In+ and Tl+ [23]. The cal-
culations were performed using a combination of the rela-
tivistic Hartree-Fock model and many-body perturbation

1014 Hz. The large diﬀerence between In+ and
·
Tl+ in the potential rate of change of these transitions is
due to the increased magnitude of the relativistic correc-
tions for heavier atoms. The scaling rule for this eﬀect is
not simple but the relative magnitude of the corrections
is expected to increase as (αZ)x with Z = 49 and 81 for
indium and thallium respectively. The value 3.0 for x
agrees quite well with the β values reported here.

∼

One of the main obstacles in performing an experiment
to compare frequency references in which one of the refer-
ences is optical is that appropriate electronics to not exist
1015 Hz. With sig-
to measure the optical frequency of
niﬁcant eﬀort, some workers have discovered clever meth-
ods to relate optical frequencies to directly measurable
microwave standards [16]. However, the proposed exper-
iment does not require accurate knowledge of the frequen-
cies of the In+ and Tl+ references, or even the accurate
knowledge of the diﬀerence frequency. It is suﬃcient to
measure changes in the diﬀerence frequency. For this
measurement, the use of an optical stabilization transfer
cavity is proposed.

↔

Narrow-band sources of coherent optical radiation will
be used to probe the metastable 1S0
3P0 transitions
of In+ and Tl+, thereby creating ion-stabilized frequency
references. One of the stabilized sources will be used to
stabilize the cavity resonance while the other reference
will be shifted into resonance with the cavity. This can
be eﬀected with an electrooptic device which can trans-
late the reference frequency by the frequency of the ap-
plied oscillator drive. By monitoring the drive frequency,
we can directly monitor any change in the diﬀerence fre-
quency between the In+ and Tl+ references.

Measurements of the shifter frequency separated in
time can then be used to place constraints on ˙α: Assum-
ing the In+ and Tl+ references possess the same stability,
the accuracy to which ˙α/α can be determined is 3.0 σ
where σ is the fractional uncertainty of the In+ and Tl+
frequency references. Since σ decreases as t−1/2 and to

becomes limited by noise, the sensitivity improves as
A trapped ion time or frequency reference can oﬀer sig-
niﬁcant improvements in stability over neutral atom ref-
erences . Evidence of this appears in Table II which shows
that the Hg+ reference stability is limited by magnetic
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations and not by uncontrollable collisional ef-
fects. Table III presents several virtues of a trapped ion
standard.

∼

Further advantages are gained by choosing a high os-
cillation frequency and an ion with little sensitivity to
changes in its environment. Table IV presents some of
the beneﬁts of choosing In+, a IIIA ion with an appro-
priate optical transition, as a reference.

A description of the exact geometry of an ion trap is
not required for the following discussion. We will there-
fore assume the standard Paul trap geometry with hyper-
boloids of revolution as shown in Fig. 1. The following
results can be modiﬁed for other trap geometries by in-
cluding parameters of order unity [17].

When an appropriately fast and large oscillating volt-
age is applied between the endcaps and central ring,
the motion of the ion can be separated into two com-
ponents. One component oscillates at the frequency of
the applied alternating voltage and has a small ampli-
tude. This is termed “micromotion.” The other com-
ponent of the motion is that of a particle in a harmonic
potential. The harmonic potential frequency, or secular
frequency, along the trap axis is given by the formula
ωz = √2eV0/M r2
0Ω for a singly-charged ion of mass M
in a trap with drive frequency Ω and voltage of ampli-
tude V0 . The electron charge is e. For typical traps, r0
is a few millimeters, V0 is 0.5–1 kV, and Ω/2π is usually
10–30 MHz. If M
200 amu, these parameters can easily

where γ is the cooling transition linewidth, the absorp-
tion spectrum will include distinct sidebands separated
by the secular frequency. Each of these sidebands corre-

The next most diﬃcult problem plaguing time and fre-

ﬁeld shifts. By considering IIIA ions such as indium and
thallium, ﬁeld shifts can be reduced below 10−18 using
standard techniques. Table IV presents the beneﬁts of
basing a standard on indium. The values for thallium
are similar.

Magnetic ﬁelds can be reduced in a small experimental
apparatus to the level of micro-Gauss with passive shield-
ing, and the Stark shifts of the cooled indium ion in the
previously described trap are
ω0. Moreover,
diﬃculties noted by others such as a quadratic Zeeman
shift [20] are also avoided by using IIIA ions.

Optical atomic references oﬀer a signiﬁcant advantge
over microwave references in short-time stability. For an
atomic reference limitted by quantum statistics and using
the Ramsey’s method of separated oscillatory ﬁelds [21],
the two-sample Allan variance takes the form σ =
1/ω0√N TRt [22]. The center frequency of the reference
is ω0, N is the number of (uncorrelated) atoms contribut-
ing to the signal, TR is the Ramsey interrogation time,
and t is the total integration time. Optical references of-

There are shifts and broadening mechanisms other
than those already discussed that can lead to system-
atic errors in this type of measurement. For instance,
Doppler shifts between the atom and the resonator could
cause an anomolous positive result. These shifts arise
largely from acoustical noise which exists mainly below
1 kHz. A ﬁrst-order Doppler shift caused by a 30 Hz vi-
bration with an amplitude of 20 nm will broaden the res-
onator line by about 1 Hz. This is small compared with
103 Hz resonator width and can be further
the expected
reduced by stabilizing various parts of the apparatus and
isolating it from these perterbations. At a similar noise
level, the second-order Doppler shift is negligible: More
speciﬁcally, the amplitude of 30 Hz vibrations would have
to be nearly a meter to eﬀect a similar shift.

∼

A change in the pressure will change the index of re-
fraction of the air between the resonator mirrors and will
alter the resonance condition. The low pressure limit of
the index of refraction of standard air [24] can be used
10−6∆p with
to estimate this eﬀect. The result is ∆n = 2
·
∆p in torr. Pressure changes of 10−9 torr will shift the
resonance by about 1 Hz. We can reduce this eﬀect to
below 10−3 Hz by placing the resonator in a vacuum of
10−11 torr. At this pressure, ∆n = 1
10−19∆T where ∆T
is the change in temperature measured in Kelvin.

·

Unless the intracavity power of the high ﬁnesse transfer
cavity is stabilized, the mirror coatings may heat and cool
causing additional broading of the cavity resonance. This
eﬀect can be mitigated by using low power and stabilizing
the cavity throughput.

Due to the similarily of the 1S0

3P0 transition fre-
quencies of In+ and Tl+, an order of magnitude of insen-
sitivity to Doppler broadening, pressure shifts and mirror

↔

heating eﬀects is gained over the limits discussed above.
An additional beneﬁt for comparing two IIIA ions is
that the electronic conﬁguration of In+ and Tl+ is similar.
This should eﬀect reduced sensitivity to ﬁeld shifts in a
frequency diﬀerence measurement.

The fractional stability of frequency references near
108 Hz can be better than 10−12 or in frequency units
10−4 Hz. When one of these references is used to drive
∼
the frequency shifters, its frequency uncertainty will add
to the fractional frequency uncertainty of the diﬀerence
measurements between the In+ and Tl+ references at the
10−19. It is likely that a cesium reference will be
level of
needed to achieve this stability. The frequency of the ce-
sium reference will also change for a nonzero ˙α. However,
its eﬀect will be reduced by the factor of 105 correspond-
ing to the ratio of the cesium reference frequency and the
frequencies of the In+ and Tl+ references.

∼

We also propose to use a linear ion trap to simulta-
neously trap the indium and thallium ions. There are
several advantages to this approach. The ﬁrst advantage
is that the indium cooling and interrogation transition is
narrow enough to allow cooling directly to the motional
ground state. As the ions’ motion is coupled through
their mutual repulsion, the indium ion can be used to
sympathetically cool an In-Tl two-ion crystal to the mo-
tional ground state. The respective transition in thallium
is too broad to achieve this ﬁnal state, but can be used in
an initial cooling stage to more quickly reduce the ions’
temperature. Secondly, the ion separation will be about
20 µm ensuring that both ions are exposed to the same
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

A potential limitation in this technique is that the nei-
ther ion will be at the zero-ﬁeld point along the axis of the
trap. Both ions will be exposed to some DC electric ﬁeld
from the endcaps that can cause a quadratic Stark shift of
the metastable transition. The magnitude of the electric
(d/z0)
(U0/z0)
ﬁeld to which they will be exposed is Ed ≈

axial dimension and 2d is the ion separation. For typical

parameters, Ed ∼

tude for each ion will be
Moreover, the proposed measurement is sensitive only to
changes in the diﬀerence frequency of the In+ and Tl+
references. Reducing ﬂuctuations in endcap voltage to
1% reduces changes in the quadratic Stark shift by ap-
proximately another factor of 100.

∼

In conclusion, an optical-optical test of the possible
space-time variation of the ﬁne structure constant is pro-
posed. A direct frequency diﬀerence measurement for
the optical references can be performed by utilizing a
stabilization transfer cavity. The choice of indium and
thallium ions simultaneously conﬁned in a linear trap al-
lows the In-Tl crystal to be cooled to the ground state of
the motion with a single laser. This conﬁguration does
not limit the ultimate relative stability of corresponding
frequency references. By using two group IIIA ions, the

limit of ˙α/α
time over which the frequency references are compared.
A near-term goal of ˙α/α

10−15/yr is realistic.

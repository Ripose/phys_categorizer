Abstract

We propose and analyze the possibility of performing two-photon continuous-

wave Doppler-cooling of hydrogen atoms using the 1S − 2S transition.

“Quenching” of the 2S level (by coupling with the 2P state) is used to increase

the cycling frequency, and to control the equilibrium temperature. Theoreti-

cal and numerical studies of the heating eﬀect due to Doppler-free two-photon

transitions evidence an increase of the temperature by a factor of two. The

equilibrium temperature decreases with the eﬀective (quenching dependent)

width of the excited state and can thus be adjusted up to values close to the

recoil temperature.

Laser cooling of neutral atoms has been a most active research ﬁeld for many years now,

producing a great deal of new physics. Still, the hydrogen atom, whose “simple” structure

has lead to fundamental steps in the understanding of quantum mechanics, has not yet been

laser-cooled. The recent experimental demonstration of the Bose-Einstein condensation of

H adds even more interest on laser cooling of hydrogen [1]. One of the main diﬃculties

encountered in doing so is that all transitions starting from the ground state of H fall in the

vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range (121 nm for the 1S − 2P transition), a spectral domain

where coherent radiation is diﬃcult to generate. In 1993, M. Allegrini and E. Arimondo have

suggested the laser cooling of hydrogen by two-photon π pulses on the 1S − 3S transition

(wavelength of 200 nm for two-photon transitions) [2]. Since then, methods for generation

of CW, VUV, laser radiation have considerably improved, and have been extensively used

in metrological experiments [3]. This technical progress allows one to realistically envisage

the two-photon Doppler cooling (TPDC) of hydrogen in the continuous wave regime, in

particular for the 1S − 2S two-photon transition.

Laser cooling relies on the ability of the atom to perform a great number of ﬂuorescence

cycles in which momentum is exchanged with the radiation ﬁeld. It is well known that 2S

is a long-lived metastable state, with a lifetime approaching one second. From this point

of view, the 1S − 2S two-photon transition is not suitable for cooling. On the other hand,

the minimum temperature achieved via Doppler cooling is proportional to the linewidth of

the excited level involved on the process [4], a result that will be shown to be also valid for

TPDC. From this point of view 2S is an interesting state.

In order to conciliate these antagonistic properties of the 1S − 2P transition, we consider

in the present work the possibility of using the “quenching” [5] of the 2S state to control

the cycling frequency of the TPDC process. For the sake of simplicity, we work with a one-

dimensional model. We write rate equations describing TPDC on the 1S − 2S transition

in presence of quenching. The quenching ratio is considered as a free parameter, allowing

control of the equilibrium temperature. The cooling method is then in principle limited only

by photon recoil eﬀects.

2

We also develop analytical approaches to the problem. A Fokker-Planck equation is

derived, describing the dynamics of the process for temperatures well above the recoil tem-

perature Tr (corresponding to the kinetic energy acquired by an atom in emitting a photon).

A numerical analysis of the dynamics of the cooling process completes our study.

Let us consider a hydrogen atom of mass M and velocity v parallel to the z-axis (Fig. 1)

interacting with two counterpropagating waves of angular frequency ωL with 2ωL = ω0 + δ,

where ω0/2π = 2.5 × 1014 Hz is the frequency corresponding to the transition 1S → 2S,

and also deﬁne the quantity k ≃ 2kL = 2ωL/c. The shift of velocity corresponding to

the absorption of two-photons in the same laser wave is ∆ = ¯hk/M = 3.1 m/s. We will

neglect the frequency separation between 2S and 2P states (the Lamb shift – which is of

order of 1.04 GHz) and consider that the one-photon spontaneous desexcitation from the 2P

states also shifts the atomic velocity of ∆ randomly in the +z or −z direction. Note that

Tr = M∆2/kB ≈ 1.2 mK for the considered transition (kB is the Boltzmann constant). We

neglect the photo-ionization process connecting the excited states to the continuum. This

is justiﬁed by the 1/E decreasing of the continuum density of states as a function of their

energy E and by the fact that a monochromatic laser couples the excited levels only to a

very small range of continuum levels.

The atom is subjected to a controllable quenching process that couples the 2S state

to the 2P state (linewidth Γ2P = 6.3 × 108s−1). The adjustable quenching rate is Γq.

Four two-photon absorption process are allowed:

i) absorption of two photons from the

+z-propagating wave (named wave “+” in what follows), with a rate Γ1 and corresponding

to the a total atomic velocity shift of +∆; ii) absorption of two photons from the −z-

propagating wave (wave “−”), with a rate Γ−1 and atomic velocity shift of −∆; iii) the

absorption of a photon in the wave “+” followed by the absorption of a photon in the wave

“−”, with no velocity shift and iv) the absorption of a photon in the wave “−” followed by

the absorption of a photon in the wave “+”, with no velocity shift. The two latter process

are indistinguishable, and the only relevant transition rate is that obtained by squaring the

sum of the amplitudes of these process (called Γ0). Also, these process are “Doppler-free”

3

(DF) as they are insensitive to the atomic velocity (to the ﬁrst order in v/c) and do not shift

the atomic velocity. Thus, they cannot contribute to the cooling process. As atoms excited

by the DF process must eventually spontaneously decay to the ground state, this process

heats the atoms.

In the limit of low velocities, the transition amplitude for each of the

four processes is the same. One thus expects the DF transitions to increase the equilibrium

temperature by a factor of two.

We can easily account for the presence of the quenching by introducing an eﬀective

linewidth of the excited level (which, due to the quenching process, is a mixing of the 2S

and 2P levels) given by

Γe = Γ2P

Γq

Γq + Γ2P

= gΓ2P

(1)

with g ≡ Γq/(Γq + Γ2P ). This approximation is true as far as the quenching ratio is much

greater than the width of the 2S state (note that this range is very large, as the width of

the 2S state is about 10−8 times that of the 2P state).

The two-photon transition rates [6] are given by:

Γn = Γ2P

g
2

(1 + 3δn0) ¯I 2

(¯δ − nKV )2 + g2/4

(2)

where n = {−1, 0, 1} describes, respectively, the absorption from the “−” wave, DF transi-

tions, and the absorption from the “+” wave. ¯I ≡ I/Is where Is is the two-photon saturation

intensity, ¯δ is the two-photon detuning divided by Γ2P , K ≡ k∆/Γ2P = 0.26 and V ≡ v/∆.

The rate equations describing the evolution of the velocity distribution n(V, t) and

n∗(V, t) for, respectively, atoms in the ground and in the excited level are thus

∂n(V, t)

∂t

= − [Γ−1(V ) + Γ0 + Γ1(V )] n(V, t) +

[n∗(V − 1) + n∗(V + 1)]

∂n∗(V, t)

∂t

= Γ−1(V − 1)n(V − 1, t) + Γ0n(V, t) + Γ1(V + 1)n(V + 1, t) − Γen∗(V, t).

(3b)

The deduction of the above equations is quite straightforward (cf. Fig 1). The ﬁrst term

in the right-hand side of Eq. (3a) describes the depopulation of the ground-state velocity

4

class V by two-photon transitions, whereas the second term describes the repopulation of

the same velocity class by spontaneous decay from the excited level. In the same way, the

three ﬁrst terms in the right-hand side of Eq. (3b) describe the repopulation of the excited

state velocity class V by two-photon transition, and the last term the depopulation of this

velocity class by spontaneous transitions. For each term, we took into account the velocity

shift (V → V ± 1) associated with each transition and supposed that spontaneous emission

is symmetric under spatial inversion.

For moderate laser intensities, one can adiabatically eliminate the population of excited

level. This is valid far from the saturation of the two-photon transitions and reduces the

Eqs. (3a-3b) to one equation describing the evolution of the ground-state population:

{Γ0 [n(V − 1, t) + n(V + 1, t)] + Γ−1(V − 2)n(V − 2, t) + Γ1(V + 2)n(V + 2, t)} (4)

Eq.(4) is in fact a set of linear ordinary diﬀerential equations coupling the populations of

velocity classes separated by an integer: V, V ± 1, V ± 2, · · ·. This discretization exists only

in the 1-D approach considered here, but it does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the conclusions of

our study, while greatly simplifying the numerical approach.

Eqs.(4) can be recast as dn/dt = Cn, where C is a square matrix and n is the vector

(· · · n(−i, t), · · · n(0, t), n(1, t), · · ·). Numerically, the equilibrium distribution is obtained in

a simple way as the eigenvector neq of C with zero eigenvalue. In this way, the asymptotic

temperature is obtained as :

Fig. 2 shows the equilibrium distribution obtained by numerical simulation for ¯δ = −0.25

and g = 1/3. The dotted curve corresponds to the distribution obtained by artiﬁcially

suppressing DF transitions (i.e., by setting Γ0 = 0). As we pointed out earlier, the DF

transitions lead to a heating eﬀect. Doppler cooling is eﬃcient mainly for atoms distributed

5

on a range of g/K around the velocity V = ±|¯δ|/K [4] whereas Doppler-free transitions are

independent of the velocity; all velocity classes are thus are aﬀected by the heating. As a

consequence, DF transitions induce a deformation of the velocity proﬁle, specially for small

values of g and ¯δ, superimposing a sharp peak of cold atoms on a wide background of “hot”

atoms. In what follows, all numerically calculated-temperatures are deduced form the width

of the thin peak of cold atoms.

Eqs. (3a) and (3b) or Eq. (4) have no exact solution. However, using some reasonable

hypothesis, it is possible to develop analytical approaches. The most usual of these ap-

proaches is to derive from the above equations a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) describing

the evolution of the velocity distribution. The derivation of the FPE for two-photon cool-

ing follows the standard lines that can be found in the literature (see [7]). If |V | ≫ 1 the

coeﬃcients in the resulting equation can be expanded up to second order in 1/|V | (this is

the so-called hypothesis of small jumps). Moreover, if K|V | ≪ |¯δ|, g the resulting expression

can be expanded up to the order V . The resulting FPE reads

where ¯Γ ≡ Γ−1(0) = Γ0/4 and ¯Γ′ is the V -derivative of Γ−1 evaluated at V = 0. Multiplying

this equation by V 2 and integrating over V one easily obtains:

dhV 2i

dt

= −4 ¯Γ′hV 2i +(cid:16)4¯Γ + Γ0(cid:17)

(7)

As hV 2i = T /Tr, this equation shows that the characteristic relaxation time is (4 ¯Γ′)−1 =

(gΓ2P ¯I 2¯δK)/(4¯δ2 + g2).

The equilibrium temperature is then given by

T

(8)

This results conﬁrms that the Doppler-free two-photon transitions, corresponding to the

contribution Γ0/2 = 2¯Γ in Eq. (8) increase the equilibrium temperature (at least in the

range of validity of the FPE) by a factor 2. This fact can also be veriﬁed from the numerical

6

simulations, as shown in Fig. 3, where the dotted curve corresponds to the temperature

obtained without DF transitions. As in one-photon Doppler-cooling, the equilibrium tem-

perature is independent of the laser intensity (but the time need to achieve cooling obviously

increases as the laser intensity diminishes).

Note that the range of validity of the FPE is |V | ≫ 1. It thus fails when the temperature

approaches the recoil temperature (or, in other words, |V | ≈ 1). Fig. 4 shows the dependence

of the equilibrium temperature as a function of the detuning for diﬀerent values of parameter

g. The minimum temperature is clearly reduced by the decreasing of g, up to values close

to the recoil temperature Tr. Moreover, the ﬁgure shows that the minimum temperature

generally agrees with the theoretical predictions: it is governed both by the eﬀective linewidth

g of the excited state and by the detuning, the optimum value being ¯δ ≈ −g/2 (in the range

of validity of the FPE). A reasonably good agreement between numerical data and the FPE

prediction within its range of validity is also observed.

Let us ﬁnally note that an interesting practical possibility is to change the quenching

parameter as the cooling process proceeds. One starts with a high value of g in order to

rapidly cool the atoms to a few recoil velocities. Then, the quenching parameter and the

detuning are progressively decreased, achieving temperatures of order of the recoil temper-

ature. A detail study of the procedure optimizing the ﬁnal temperature is however out of

the scope of the present paper.

In conclusion, we have suggested and analyzed, both analytically and numerically, the

using of 1S − 2S two-photon transition together with the quenching of the 2S-state to cool

hydrogen atoms to velocities approaching the recoil limit. The quenching ratio gives an

additional, dynamically controllable parameter.

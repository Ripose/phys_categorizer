The two-time Green function method in quantum electrodynamics of high-Z few-electron atoms
is described in detail. This method provides a simple procedure for deriving formal expressions for
the energy shift of a single level and for the energies and wave functions of degenerate and quasi-
degenerate states. It also allows one to derive formal expressions for the transition and scattering
amplitudes. Application of the method to resonance scattering processes yields a systematic theory
for the spectral line shape. The practical ability of the method is demonstrated by deriving the formal
expressions for the QED and interelectronic-interaction corrections to energy levels and transition
and scattering amplitudes in one-, two-, and three-electron atoms. The resonance scattering of a
photon by a one-electron atom is also considered.

I. INTRODUCTION

A great progress in experimental investigations of high-Z few-electron systems (see, e.g., [1]) stimulated theorists
to perform accurate QED calculations for these systems. The calculations of the QED and interelectronic-interaction
corrections in high-Z few-electron systems are conveniently divided in two stages. The ﬁrst stage consists in deriving
formal expressions for these corrections from the ﬁrst principles of QED. The second one consists in numerical
evaluations of these expressions. The present paper will be completely focused on the ﬁrst stage. As to the numerical
evalutions of the QED corrections, they are recently reviewed in [2–6].

Historically, the ﬁrst method suitable for derivation of the formal expressions for the energy shift of a bound state
level was formulated by Gell-Mann, Low, and Sucher [7,8]. This method is based on introducing an adiabatically
damped factor, exp (−λ|t|), in the interaction Hamiltonian and expressing the energy shift in terms of so-called
adiabatic Sλ matrix elements. Due to its simple formulation, the Gell-Mann–Low–Sucher formula for the energy shift
gained wide spreading in the literature related to high-Z few-electron systems [9–16]. However, the practical use of this
method showed that it has several serious drawbacks. One of them consists in strong complication of the derivation
of the formal expressions for so-called reducible diagrams. By the reducible diagrams we mean here the diagrams in
which an intermediate state energy of the atom coincides with the reference state energy (this terminology is quite
natural since it can be considered as an extension of the deﬁnitions introduced by Dyson [17] and by Bethe and
Salpeter [18] to high-Z few-electron atoms). As to irreducuble diagrams, i.e. the diagrams in which the intermediate
state energies diﬀer from the reference state energy, the derivation of the formal expressions for them can easily be
reduced to the usual (λ = 0) S-matrix elements in every method, including the Gell-Mann–Low–Sucher method as
well (see, e.g., [11,15]), and, therefore, causes no problem. Another serious drawback of the Gell-Mann–Low–Sucher
method consists in the fact that this method needs special studying the renormalization procedure since the adibatic
Sλ-matrix is suﬀered from the ultraviolet divergences. Due to noncovariantness of the adiabatically damped factor,
the ultraviolet divergences can not be removed from Sλ if λ 6= 0. However, from the physical point of view one may
expect that these divergenes cancel each other in the expression for the energy shift and, therefore, may be disregarded
in the calculation of the energy shift of a single level. But for the case of degenerate levels, this problem becomes
very urgent since we can not expect that the standard renormalization procedure makes the secular operator to be
ﬁnite in the ultraviolet limit [10,12]. In addition, we should note that at present there is no formalism based on the
Gell-Mann–Low–Sucher approach which would provide treatment of quasidegenerate levels. To date, no formalism in
the framework of this approach was developed for calculation of the transition or scattering amplitudes.

The same problems refer to the evolution operator method developed in [19–23].
Another way to formulate the perturbation theory for high-Z few-electron systems consists in using Green’s func-
tions. These functions contain the complete information about the energy levels and the transition and scattering
amplitudes. The renormalization problem does not appear in this way since Green’s functions can be renormalized
from the very beginning (see, e.g., [24]). To date, various versions of the Green function formalism were developed
which diﬀer from each other by methods of extracting the physical information (the energy levels and the transition
and scattering amplitudes) from Green’s functions. One of these methods was worked out in [25–29] and was success-
fully employed in many practical calculations [30–41]. Since one of the key elements of this methods consists in using
two-time Green’s functions, in what follows we will call it as the two-time Green function (TTGF) method. This
method, which provided solving all the problems appeared in the other formalisms indicated above, will be considered
in detail in the present paper.

As to other versions of the Green function method [12,43–51,16], a detailed discussion of them would be beyond the
scope of the present paper. We note only that some of these methods are also based on employing two-time Green
function’s but yield other forms of the perturbation theory. So, in [12,44–47] the two-time Green functions were used
for constructing quasipotential equations for high-Z few-electron systems. It corresponds to the perturbation theory in
the Brillouin-Wigner form while the method of Refs. [25–29] yields the perturbation theory in the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger
form. Various versions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation derived from the 2N -time Green function formalism for high-Z
few-electron systems can be found in [12,48]. In [49,50] the perturbation theory in the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger form is
constructed in the case of a one-electron system where the problem of relative electron times is absent.

The relativistic unit system ( ¯h = c = 1 ) and the Heaviside charge unit (α = e2

4π , e < 0) are used in the paper.

II. ENERGY LEVELS OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS

In this section we formulate the perturbation theory for calculation of the energy levels in high-Z few-electron
atoms. In these systems the number of the electrons, which we denote by N , is much smaller than the nuclear charge
number Z. It follows that the interaction of the electrons with each other and with the quantized electromagnetic

3

ﬁeld is much smaller (by factors 1/Z and α, respectively) than the interaction of the electrons with the Coulomb ﬁeld
of the nucleus. Therefore, it is natural to assume that in zeroth approximation the electrons interact only with the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus and obey the Dirac equation

(−iα · ∇ + βm + VC(x))ψn(x) = εnψn(x) .

(2.1)

The interaction of the electrons with each other and with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld is accounted by pertur-
bation theory. In this way we get the quantum electrodynamics in the Furry picture. It should be noted that we could
start also with the Dirac equation with an eﬀective potential Veﬀ (x) which describes approximately the interaction
with the other electrons. In this case the interaction with the potential δV (x) = VC(x) − Veﬀ (x) must be accounted
for perturbatively. Using the eﬀective potential provides an extention of the theory to many-electron atoms where,
for instance, a local version of the Hartree-Fock potential can be used as Veﬀ (x). However, for simplicity, in what
follows we will assume that in zeroth approximation the electrons interact only with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus.
In the present paper we will mainly consider the perturbation theory with the standard QED vacuum. The transition
to the formalism in which the role of the vacuum is played by closed shells is realized by replacing i0 with −i0 in the
electron propagator denominators corresponding to the closed shells.
Before to formulate the perturbation theory for calculations of the interelectronic interaction and radiative correc-
tions to the energy levels, we consider standard equations of the Green function approach in quantum electrodynamics.

It can be shown that the complete information about the energy levels of an N -electron atom is contained in Green’s

function deﬁned as

A. 2N -time Green function

G(x′

1, . . . x′

N ; x1, . . . xN ) = h0|T ψ(x′

1)··· ψ(x′

N )ψ(xN )··· ψ(x1)|0i ,

(2.2)

where ψ(x) is the electron-positron ﬁeld operator in the Heisenberg representation, ψ(x) = ψ†γ0, and T is the time-
ordered product operator. The basic equations of the quantum electrodynamics in the Heisenberg representation are
summarized in Appendix A. The equation (2.2) presents a standard deﬁnition of 2N -time Green’s function which is
a fundamental object of the quantum electrodynamics. It can be shown (see, e.g., [24,52]) that in the interaction
representation the Green function is given by

1, . . . x′

is the interaction Hamiltonian. Commutators in equation (2.5) refer to operators only. The ﬁrst term in (2.5) describes
the interaction of the electron-positron ﬁeld with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and the second one is the mass
renormalization counterterm. We consider here that the interaction of the electrons with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the
nucleus is included into the unperturbed Hamiltonian (the Furry picture). However, there is also an alternative
method to get the Furry picture. In this method the interaction with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus is included in
the interaction Hamiltonion and the Furry picture is obtained by summing inﬁnite sequences of Feynman diagrams
describing the interaction of electrons with the Coulomb potential. As a result of this summation, the free-electron
propagators are replaced by the bound-electron propagators. This method is very convenient for studying processes
involving continuum-electron states and will be used in the section concerning the radiative recombination process.

The Green function G is constructed by perturbation theory according to equation (2.4). This is carried out with
the aid of Wick’s theorem (see, e.g., [24]). According to this theorem the time-ordered product of ﬁeld operators is
equal to the sum of normal-ordered products with all possible contractions between the operators

4

T (ABCD ···) = N (ABCD ···) + N (AaBaCD ···) + N (AaBCaD ···)

+ all possible contractions ,

(2.6)

where N is the normal-ordered product operator and the superscripts denote the contraction between the correspond-
ing operators. The contraction between neighbouring operators is deﬁned by
AaBa = T (AB) − N (AB) = h0|T (AB)|0i .

(2.7)

If the contracted operators are boson’s operators they can be put one next to another. If the contracted operators are
fermion’s operators they also can be put one next to another but in this case the expression must be multiplied with
the parity of the permutation of fermionic operators. Since in the Green function the vacuum expectation value is
calculated, only the term with all contracted operators survives on the right-hand side of equation (2.6). In contrast
to the free-electron QED, in the Furry picture the time-ordered product of two fermions operators must be deﬁned
also for the equal-time case to produce the correct vacuum polarization terms. As was noticed in [53], the deﬁnition

T [A(t)B(t)] =

1
2

A(t)B(t) −

1
2

B(t)A(t)

provides the following simple rule for dealing with the interaction operator. It can be written as

HI (x) = e ψin(x)γµψin(x)Aµ

in(x) − δm ψin(x)ψin(x)

(2.8)

(2.9)

and then Wick’s theorem is applied with contractions between all operators, including equal-time operators. We note
that the problem of the deﬁnition of the time-ordered product of fermion operators at equal times does not appear
at all if the alternative method for producing the Furry picture discussed above is employed.

The contractions between the electron-positron ﬁelds and between the photon ﬁelds lead to the following propagators

and

Here the Feynman gauge is considered. In equation (2.10) the label n runs over all bound and continuum states.

The denominator in equation (2.3) describes unobservable vacuum-vacuum transitions and, as one can show (see,
e.g., [24]), it cancels disconnected vacuum-vacuum subdiagrams from the nominator. Therefore, we can simply omit
all diagrams containing disconnected vacuum-vacuum subdiagrams in the nominator and replace the denominator by
1.

In principle, the Green function G contains the complete information about the energy levels of the atomic system.
This can be shown by deriving the spectral representation for G. However, it is a hard task to extract this information
directly from G since it depends on 2(N − 1) relative times (energies) in the time (energy) representation. As we will
see in the next section, the two-time Green function deﬁned as

also contains the complete information about the energy levels, and it is a much simpler task to extract the energy

B. Two-time Green function and its analytical properties

Let us introduce the Fourier transform of the two-time Green function by

×h0|T ψ(x′0, x′

N )ψ(x0, xN )··· ψ(x0, x1)|0i ,

(2.18)

where, as in (2.2), the Heisenberg representation for the electron-positron ﬁeld operators is used. Deﬁned by equation
(2.18) for real E, the Green function G can be continued analytically to the complex E plane. Analytical properties
of this type Green functions in the complex E plane were studied in various ﬁelds of physics (see, e.g., [54–56]).
In quantum ﬁeld theory they were considered in detail by Logunov and Tavkhelidze in Ref. [57] (see also Ref.
[58]), where the two-time Green function was employed for constructing a quasipotential equation. To study the
analytical properties of the two-time Green function we derive the spectral representation for G. Using the time-shift
transformation rule for the Heisenberg operators (see Appendix A)

and the equations

ψ(x0, x) = exp (iHx0)ψ(0, x) exp (−iHx0)

H|ni = En|ni ,

the sum over n in the right-hand side of equation (2.27) and only states with electric charge −eN contribute to B in
the sum over n in the right-hand side of equation (2.28). This can easily be shown by using the following commutation
relations

where Q is the charge operator in the Heisenberg representation. Therefore, the equation (2.31) can be written as

min] and [E(+)

In what follows we will be interested in bound states of the system. According to equations (2.24)-(2.34) the bound
states correspond to the poles of the function G(E) on the right-hand real semiaxis. In the zeroth approximation, when
the interaction between the electron-positron ﬁeld and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ, the poles corresponding
to bound states are isolated (see Fig. 2). Switching on the interaction between the ﬁelds transforms the isolated poles
into the branch points. It is caused by the fact that due to zero photon mass the bound states are no longer isolated
points of the spectrum. Disregarding the instability of excited states, the singularities of the Green function G(E)
are shown in Fig. 3. The poles corresponding to the bound states lie on the upper boundary of the cut starting from
the pole corresponding to the ground state. It is natural to assume that G(E) can be continued analytically under
the cut, to the second sheet of the Riemann surface. As a result of this continuation the singularities of G(E) can be
turned down as displayed in Fig. 4.
In fact due to instability of excited states the energies of these states have small imaginary components and,
therefore, the related poles lie slightly below the right-hand real semiaxis (Fig. 5). However, in calculations of the
energy levels and the transition and scattering amplitudes of non-resonance processes we will neglect the instability of
the excited states and, therefore, will assume that the poles lie on the real axis. The imaginary parts of the energies
will be taken into account when we will consider the resonance scattering processes.

To formulate the perturbation theory for calculatons of the energy levels and the transition and scattering amplitudes
we will need to isolate the poles corresponding to the bound states from the related cuts. It can be done by introducing
a non-zero photon mass µ which is generally assumed to be larger than the energy shift (or the energy splitting) of
the level (levels) under consideration and much smaller than the distance to other levels. The singularities of G(E)
with non-zero photon mass, including one- and two-photon spectra, are shown in Fig. 6. As one can see from this
ﬁgure, introducing the photon mass makes the poles corresponding to the bound states to be isolated.

In every ﬁnite order of the perturbation theory the singularities of the Green function G(E) in the complex E-plane
are deﬁned by the unperturbed Hamiltonian. In quantum mechanics this fact easily follows from the expansion of the
Green function (E − H)−1 = (E − H0 − δV )−1 in powers of the perturbation potential δV

(E − H)−1 =

∞Xn=0
(E − H0)−1[δV (E − H0)−1]n .

(2.35)

As one can see from this equation, in n-th order of the perturbation theory the Green function has poles of all
orders till n + 1 at the unperturbed positions of the bound state energies. This fact remains also valid in quantum
electrodynamics for G(E) deﬁned above. It can easily be checked for every speciﬁc diagram in ﬁrst and second orders
in α. A general proof for an arbitrary diagram is given in Appendix B.

C. Energy shift of a single level

Let we are interested in the energy shift ∆Ea = Ea − E(0)
the interaction. The unperturbed energy E(0)

a

a

of a single isolated level a of an N -electron atom due to

is equal to the sum of the one-electron Dirac-Coulomb energies

which are deﬁned by the Dirac equation (2.1). In a simple case the unperturbed wave function ua(x1, ..., xN ) is a
one-determinant function

E(0)
a = εa1 + ··· + εaN ,

where ψn are the one-electron Dirac wave functions deﬁned by equation (2.1) and P is the permutation operator. In
a general case the unperturbed wave function is a linear combination of the one-determinant functions

We assume here that a non-zero photon mass µ is introduced to isolate the pole corresponding to the bound state
a from the related cut. We consider that the photon mass is larger than the energy shift under consideration and
much smaller than the distance to other levels. To generate the perturbation series for Ea it is convenient to use a
contour integral formalism developed ﬁrst in the operator theory by Sz¨okefalvi-Nagy and Kato [59–64]. Choosing a
contour Γ in the complex E plane so that it surrounds the pole corresponding to the level a and keeps outside all
other singularities (see Fig. 7) we have

instead of ψ(0, x) and ψ(0, x), respectively, and considering the states |ni in (2.25) and (2.26) as unperturbed states
in Fock’s space, from equations (2.24)-(2.26), (2.39) one ﬁnds

Deriving equations (2.44) and (2.48) we assumed that a non-zero photon mass µ is introduced. This allows taking
all the cuts outside the contour Γ as well as regularizing the infrared singularities of individual diagrams. In the
Feynman gauge, the photon propagator with non-zero photon mass µ is

Dρσ(ω, x − y) = −gρσZ

dk

(2π)3

exp (ik · (x − y))
ω2 − k2 − µ2 + i0

or, after integration,

Dρσ(ω, x − y) = gρσ

exp (ipω2 − µ2 + i0 |x − y|)

4π|x − y|

,

(2.53)

(2.54)

where Impω2 − µ2 + i0 > 0. Dρσ(ω, x− y) is an analytical function of ω in the complex ω plane with cuts beginning

at the points ω = −µ + i0 and ω = µ − i0 (Fig. 8). The related expressions for the photon propagator with
non-zero photon mass in other covariant gauges are presented in [24]. However, since we can put µ = 0 already
on an intermediate stage of calculations (see below), we actually do not need any speciﬁc expression for the photon
propagator with non-zero photon mass. It is suﬃcient only to assume that in another gauge the photon propagator
has the same analytical properties as in the Feynman gauge.

As was noted in the previous subsection, the singularities of the two-time Green function in the complex E plane
are deﬁned by the unperturbed Hamiltonian if it is constructed by perturbation theory. In particular, it means that
in n-th order of the perturbation theory gaa(E) has poles of all order till n + 1 at the unperturbed position of the
energy level under consideration. Therefore, in calculations by the perturbation theory it is suﬃcient to consider the
photon mass as a very small parameter which provides a separation of the pole from the related cut. At the end
of calculations after taking into account a whole gauge invariant set of Feynman diagrams we can put µ → 0. The
possibility of taking the limit µ → 0 follows, in particular, from the fact that the contour Γ can be drawn continuosly
to the point E = E(0)
Generally speaking, the energy shift of an excited level derived by formula (2.48) contains an imaginary component
which is caused by its instability. This component deﬁnes the width of the spectral line in the Lorentz approximation
(see sections III F, III G for details).

(see Fig. 7).

For practical calculations it is convenient to express the Green function gaa(E) in terms of the Fourier transform

of the 2N−time Green function deﬁned by equation (2.12). By using the identity

In practical

calculations by perturbation theory the formula (2.61) must be employed only for symmetric sets of Feynman diagrams
since the symmetry property was used in its derivation.

D. Perturbation theory for degenerate and quasidegenerate levels

Let we are interested in the atomic levels with energies E1, ..., Es arising from unperturbed degenerate or quasidegen-
erate levels with energies E(0)
. We assume, as usual, that the energy shifts of the levels under consideration
or their splitting caused by the interaction are much smaller than the distance to other levels. The unperturbed
eigenstates form a s-dimensional subspace Ω. We denote the projector on Ω by

1 , ..., E(0)

k=1 are the unperturbed wave functions which, in a general case, are linear combinations of one-determinant

g(E) = P (0)G(E)γ0

1 ...γ0

N P (0) ,

(2.63)

where, as in (2.39), the integration over the electron coordinates is implicit. As in the case of a single level, to isolate
the poles of g(E) corresponding to the bound states under consideration we introduce a nonzero photon mass µ. We
assume that the photon mass µ is larger than the energy distance between the levels under consideration and much
smaller than the distance to other levels. In this case we can choose a contour Γ in the complex E plane so that it
surrounds all the poles corresponding to the considered states (E(1), ...E(s)) and keeps outside all other singularities
including the cuts starting from the lower-lying bound states (see Fig. 9). If, in addition, we neglect the instability
of the states under consideration, the spectral representation (see equations (2.24)-(2.34)) gives

goes to zero, the vectors {ϕi}s
i=1.
Therefore, it is natural to assume that the vectors {ϕi}s
i=1 are also linearly independent. It follows that one can ﬁnd
such vectors {vi}s

k = 1, ..., s the system (2.73) has a unique solution. From (2.69)-(2.71) we have

The energy levels are determined from the equation

det(H − E) = 0 .

(2.79)

(2.80)

(2.81)

Generally speaking, the energies obtained by this equation contain imaginary components which are due to instability
of excited states. In the case when the imaginary components are much smaller than the energy distance between
the levels (or the levels have diﬀerent quantum numbers), they deﬁne the widths of the spectral lines in the Lorentz
approximation.
In the opposite case, when the imaginary components are comparable with the energy distance
between the levels which have the same quantum numbers, the spectral line shape depends on the process of the
formation of the states under consideration even in the resonance approximation (see sections III F,G for details).
In what follows, calculating the energy levels we will neglect the instability of excited states and in equations (2.79),
(2.81) will assume H ≡ (H + H †)/2.

The operators K and P are constructed through the formulas (2.67) and (2.68) by perturbation theory

where the superscript denotes the order in α. The operator H is

K = K (0) + K (1) + K (2) + ··· ,

To derive the equations (2.76)-(2.79) we introduced a non-zero photon mass µ which was assumed to be larger than
the energy distance between the levels under consideration and much smaller than the distance to other levels. At
the end of calculations after taking into account a whole gauge invariant set of Feynman diagrams we can put µ → 0.
The possibility of taking this limit in the case of quasidegenerate states follows from the fact that the cuts can be
drawn to the related poles by a deformation of the contour Γ as shown in Fig. 10.

As in the case of a single level, for practical calculations we express the Green function g(E) in terms of the Fourier

transform of the 2N -time Green function

E. Practical calculations

In this section we consider some practical applications of the method in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory.

In what follows we will use the notation

I(ω) = e2αρασDρσ(ω) .

In addition we will employ the following symmetry properties of the photon propagator

which, in particular, are valid in the Feynman and Coulomb gauges. Here I ′(ω) ≡ dI(ω)/dω .

I(ω) = I(−ω) ,

I ′(ω) = −I ′(−ω) ,

2. One-electron atom

Formal expressions for the energy shift in the case of a one-electron atom (or in the case of an atom with one electron
over closed shell) can be derived by various methods. In particular, the Dyson-Schwinger equation can be employed
for such a derivation. Therefore, the one-electron system is not the best example to demonstrate the advantages of
the method under consideration. However, we start with a detailed description of this simple case since it may serve
as the simplest introduction to the technique.

Let us consider ﬁrst a diagram describing the interaction of a one-electron atom with an external potential δV (x)

to the ﬁrst order in δV (x) (Fig. 11). According to equation (2.56) we have

The related mass counterterm diagrams (Fig. 16) are accounted for by the replacement Σ → ΣR = Σ − γ0δm in
equation (2.115). This replacement makes the irreducible contribution in equation (2.115) to be ﬁnite. As to the
reducible contribution, its ultraviolet and infrared divergencies are cancelled with the corresponding divergencies of
the vertex contribution given by equation (2.117).

3. Atom with one electron over closed shells

The consideration given above can easily be adopted to the case of an atom with one electron over closed shells by
regarding the closed shells as belonging to a new vacuum. The redeﬁnition of the vacuum results in replacing i0 with
−i0 in the electron propagator denominators corresponding to the closed shells. In other words, it means replacing
the standard Feynman contour of integration over the electron energy C by a new contour C ′ (Fig. 17). In this
formalism the one-electron radiative corrections are incorporated with the interelectronic-interaction corrections and
the energy of the closed shells is considered as the origin of reference. The diﬀerence of the integrals along C ′ and C is

18

an integral along the contour Cint. It describes the interaction of the valent electron with the closed shells electrons.
Therefore, to ﬁnd the interelectronic-interaction corrections we have to replace the contour C in the expressions for
the one-electron radiative corrections by the contour Cint. For example, in the case of one electron over the (1s)2
shell in a lithiumlike ion, the ﬁrst order interelectrinic-interaction corrections are obtained from the formulas for the
SE and VP corrections derived above by the replacement

where I(ω) is deﬁned by equation(2.92). In [34] this formalism was employed to derive formal expressions for the
interelectronic-interaction corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting in lithiumlike ions.

4. Two-electron atom

Let us consider now the energy shift of a single level (n) in a two-electron atom. In the ﬁrst order in α, in addition
to one-electron SE and VP contributions (Figs. 18,19) we have to consider the one-photon exchange diagram (Fig.
20). Since the derivation of the energy shift from the SE and VP diagrams is easily reduced to the case of a one-
electron atom by simple integration over the energy of a disconnected electron propagator, we discuss below only the
one-photon exchange diagram.

For simplicity, we assume that the unperturbed wave function of the state under consideration is the one-determinant

function

un(x1, x2) =

(−1)P ψP a(x1)ψP b(x2) .

(2.120)

The transition to the general case of a many-determinant function (2.38) causes no problem and can be done in the
ﬁnal expression for the energy shift.

The expression in the braces of (2.125) is a regular function of E inside the contour Γ, if the photon mass µ is chosen
as indicated above. A direct way to check this fact consists in integrating over p0
1 by using the apparent
It can also be understood by observing that the
expression for the photon propagator given by equation (2.53).
integrand in this expression is the sum of terms which contain singularities in p0
1 ) (for real E) from the electron
propagators only above or only below the real axis. Therefore, in each term we can vary E in the complex E plane
within the contour Γ, keeping the same order of bypassing the singularities in the p0
1 ) integration by moving
slightly the contour of the p0
1 ) integration into the complex plane. The branch points of the photon propagators
are moved outside the contour Γ due to the non-zero photon mass. However, we do not need to do these proofs since
we know the general analytical properties of the Green function gnn(E) in the complex E plane in every order of the
perturbation theory (see the related discussion above and Appendix B). According to these properties the function

n of order not higher than 2 and, therefore, the expression in the braces
of (2.125) is a regular function of E at this point. So, we have to calculate the ﬁrst order residue at the point E = E(0)
n .
We stress also that we do not need any apparent form for the analytical continuation of the expression in the braces
to the complex E plane since we calculate it only for real E, at the point E = E(0)
n , where the present expression is
valid. Calculating the E residue we get

Let us consider now some general remarks to the derivation given above. In order to perform ﬁrst the integration
over E we have separated the singularity in ∆E by employing the identities (2.123) and (2.124). Another way could
consist in transforming the left-hand sides of equations (2.123) and (2.124) by the identity

(2.129)

where we have used equation (2.127). Using this identity allows one to separate contributions singular in 1/∆E from
non-singular ones. The singular contributions result only from the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side of equation (2.129).
It can easily be understood by observing that the second term has both singularities in p0 (for real E) above the real
axis. It follows that the contour of the p0 integration in the expression for the energy shift can be moved slightly
into the complex E plane keeping the same order of bypassing the singularities. It means that we can vary E in the
complex E plane within the contour Γ and, therefore, the integrand is a regular function of E within this contour.
The identities like (2.129) are very useful for calculations in three- and more electron atoms.

We want also to note that in all cases the order of the singularity in 1/∆E is quite evident from the type of the
diagram under consideration. If the diagram is irreducible, the factors 1/∆E may come only from the initial and
ﬁnal propagators. In this case the second term in the right-hand side of equation (2.129) does not contribute to the
energy shift and, therefore, the derivation of the formal expression for the energy shift becomes trivial. For reducible
diagrams the factors 1/∆E arise also from internal electron propagators.

20

We can formulate the following simple rule for deriving the energy shift from a certain diagram. Using the identities
like (2.123), (2.124) or (2.129) we separate all singularities in 1/∆E and then integrate over E assuming that the rest
is a regular function of E within the contour Γ. As is discussed above, the order of the singularity is quite evident
for every speciﬁc diagram and it is a simple task to separate the factor 1/∆E to the correct power. However, if even
one separates this factor to a power which is larger or smaller than the real order of the singularity, it is impossible
to miss the correct result. In the ﬁrst case (the power is larger than the real order of the singularity) the result of the
calculation remains the same as in the case when one separates the factor 1/∆E to the correct power. In the second
case (the power is smaller than the real order of the singularity) one ﬁnds an inﬁnite result (∼ 1/0). It means that
we should increase the power of the separated singularity and repeat the calculation until we get a ﬁnite result.

5. Two-photon exchange diagrams for the ground state of a heliumlike atom

The two-photon exchange diagrams are presented in Fig. 21. Here we derive the energy shift from these diagrams in
the case of the ground state of a heliumlike atom. The case of an arbitrary state of a two-electron atom is considered
in detail in [32]. The wave function of the ground state is given by

The contribution ∆E(2,red)
contains an infrared divergent term which is cancelled by a related term (εn1 = εn2 = εa)
from the contribution ∆E(2)
cross. In the individual contributions the infrared singularities are regularized by a non-zero
photon mass µ. If the ladder and crossed-ladder contributions are united by the common ω-integration, the integral
is convergent and we can put µ → 0 before the integration over ω (see [32] for details). However, to show how the
calculation for a non-zero photon mass can be performed, let us calculate the reducible contribution for a ﬁnite µ.

6. Qusidegenerate states

Let us now consider some applications of the method for the case of quasidegenerate states. This case arises, for
instance, if one is interested in the energies of (1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1 states of a heliumlike ion. These states are
strongly mixed for low and middle Z and, therefore, must be treated as quasidegenerate. It means that the oﬀ-diagonal
matrix elements of the energy operator H between these states have to be taken into account. The unperturbed wave
functions are written as

ui(x1, x2) = Xmi1 mi2

hji1 mi1 ji2 mi2|JMi

1

√2XP

(−1)P ψP i1 (x1)ψP i2 (x2) ,

(2.150)

where J is the total angular momentum and M is its projection. However, in what follows, to compactify the formulas
we will construct the matrix elements of H between the one-determinant wave functions

ui(x1, x2) =

(−1)P ψP i1 (x1)ψP i2 (x2) .

(2.151)

√2XP

The transition to the wave functions deﬁned by equation (2.150) can easily be accomplished in the ﬁnal formulas.

First we consider the contribution from the one-photon exchange diagram. To derive the formulas for H (1)
i = E(0)

ik we will
assume that E(0)
k which
was considered in detail above. According to the Feynman rules and the deﬁnition of g(E), the contribution of the
one-photon exchange diagram to g(1)(E) is

k . However, all the ﬁnal formulas remain to be valid also for the case E(0)

Let us now consider the contribution to H from the combined δV - interelectronic interaction diagrams presented in
Fig. 22. For simplicity, we will assume that δV is a spherically-symmetric potential. In the case under consideration,
the simplest way to derive the formulas for H (2)
ik consists in using the fact that these diagrams can be obtained as the
ﬁrst order correction in δV to the one-photon exchange contribution derived above. So, the contribution from these
diagrams can be obtained by the following replacements in equation (2.158)

|k1i → |k1i + δ|k1i ,
|k2i → |k2i + δ|k2i ,

25

(2.159)
(2.160)

|P i1i → |P i1i + δ|P i1i ,
|P i2i → |P i2i + δ|P i2i ,

I(εa − εb) → I(εa + δεa − εb − δεb) ,

Here we have taken into account that, due to the spherical symmetry of δV , hn|δV |ai = 0 if εn = εa and |ni 6= |ai .
Decomposing the modiﬁed expression for the one-photon exchange diagram to the ﬁrst order in δV we ﬁnd that the
total correction is the sum of the irreducible and reducible parts

Equations (2.167) and (2.168) provide the matrix elements between the one-determinant wave functions deﬁned by
equation (2.151). To get the matrix elements between the wave functions deﬁned by equation (2.150), we have to
multiply these equations with the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients and to sum over projections of the one-electron angular
momenta.

The expression for H (2)

ik can also be derived by the direct application of the TTGF method. It can easily be done
in the same way as for the one-photon exchange diagram. However, we note that this derivation yields a formula for
H (2)
ik which is slightly diﬀerent from the expression given above. In particular, for the irreducible contribution one

Here O(2) is an operator of the second order in the perturbation parameter which we denote by λ (for simplicity, we
assume here that δV and the interelectronic-interaction operator I(ω) are characterized by the same perturbation
parameter). This fact can be understood by observing that the integrand in (2.170) is the sum of terms which contain
singularities from the external electron propagators only above or below of the real axis and, therefore, integrating
i − E(0)
over ω cannot result in appearing contributions ∼ 1/(E(0)
k )
It can be shown that the term ∆H (2,irred)
(in particular, it means that O(2)
remains ﬁnite when E(0)
ik
contributes only to the third and higher orders in λ and, therefore, can be omitted if we restrict our calculations to
the second order in λ. Let us prove this fact for the case of two quasidegenerate levels. In this case the energy levels
are determined from the equation

k ) which could compensate the factor (E(0)

If E1− E2 ∼ λ, the prove of the statement is evident. If E1− E2 ≫ λ, the contribution of the second order oﬀ-diagonal
matrix elements is given by

quasidegenerate states of a heliumlike atom.

7. Nuclear recoil corrections

So far we considered the nucleus as a sourse of the external Coulomb ﬁeld VC. This consideration corresponds to
the approximation of the inﬁnite nucleus mass. However, high precision calculations of the energy levels in high-Z
few-electron atoms must include also the nuclear recoil corrections to ﬁrst order in m/M (M is the nucleas mass) and
to zeroth order in α (but to all orders in αZ). As was shown in [37], these corrections can be included in calculations of
the energy levels by adding to the standard Hamiltonian of the electron-positron ﬁeld interacting with the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld and with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nuceus VC, taken in the Coulomb gauge, the following term

27

HM =

The normal ordered form of HM taken in the interaction representation must be added to the interaction Hamiltonian.
It gives the following additional lines and verteces to the Feynman rules (we assume that the Coulomb gauge is used).

where Di(ω) = −4παZαlDli(ω). The term ∆EL contains all the recoil corrections within the (αZ)4m2/M approxi-
mation while the term ∆EH contains the contribution of order (αZ)5m2/M and all contributions of higher orders in
αZ which are not included in ∆EL. The formulas (2.181)-(2.183) were ﬁrst derived by a quasipotential method in
Ref. [46] and subsequently rederived by other methods in Refs. [69,70]. The representation (2.180) was found in Ref.
[69].

Consider now a two-electron atom. For simplicity, as usual, we assume that the unperturbed wave function is
a one-determinant function (2.120). The nuclear recoil correction is the sum of the one-electron and two-electron
contributions. Using the Feynman rules and the formula (2.51) one easily ﬁnds that the one-electron contribution is
equal to the sum of the expressions (2.180) for the a and b states. The two-electron contributions correspond to the
diagrams shown in Figs. 26-28. A simple calculation of these diagrams yields

III. TRANSITION PROBABILITIES AND CROSS SECTIONS OF SCATTERING PROCESSES

According to the basic principles of the quantum ﬁeld theory [71] the number of the particles scattered on the

interval dp′

1 ··· dp′

r for a unit time and in a unit volume is

where p, p′ are the initial and ﬁnal states of the system, respectively; τp′p is the amplitude of the process deﬁned by

dWp→p′ = (2π)3s+1n1 ··· ns|τp′p|2δ(Ep − Ep′ )dp′

1 ··· dp′
r ,

(3.1)

hp′|(S − I)|pi = 2πi δ(Ep − Ep′ )τp′p ,

(3.2)

S is the scattering operator, s is the number of the initial particles, r is the number of the ﬁnal particles; n1, ...ns are
the average numbers of the particles in the unit volume.

We will consider the scattering of photons and electrons on the atom which is put at the origin of the coordinate

system. The diﬀerential cross-section is deﬁned by

dσ =

dWp→p′

j

,

(3.3)

where j is the current of the initial particles (for photons j = nc; for electrons j=nv, where v is the velocity of the
electrons in the nucleus frame). The total cross section can be found by integrating the diﬀerential cross section over
all ﬁnal states. The cross section of the elastic scattering is

σ(elast)
tot

(p) =

(2π)4

v

Z dp′δ(Ep − Ep′ )|τp′p|2 .

The total (elastic plus inelastic) cross section can be found by using the optical theorem

σtot(p) =

2(2π)3

v

Imτpp .

(3.4)

(3.5)

In terms of the amplitude fp′p which is deﬁned so that dσ = |fp′p|2dΩ, the optical theorem has a well known form
(see, e.g., [72])

The aim of this section is to derive formulas for calculation of transition and scattering amplitudes for various processes
in the framework of QED.

A. Photon emission by an atom

Consider the process of photon emission by an atom. According to the standard reduction technique (see, e.g.,
[24,52]), the atomic transition amplitude from state a to state b accompanied with photon emission with momentum
kf and polarization ǫf is

Here jν (y) is the electron-positron current operator in the Heisenberg representation, |ai and |bi are the vectors of the
initial and ﬁnal states in the Heisenberg representation, Z3 is a renormalization constant, a · b ≡ aνbν, ǫf = (0, ǫf ),
kf = (k0

f ≡ |kf|. Using the equation (see Appendix A)

f , kf ), and k0

one obtains

is the wave function of the emitted photon. Since |ai and |bi are bound states, equation (3.9) as well as the standard
reduction technique [24,52] cannot be used for a direct evaluation of the amplitude. A desired calculation formula
can be derived within the two-time Green function formalism [26–28].

To formulate the method for a general case, we will assume that in the zeroth approximation the state a belongs to
a sa-dimensional subspace of unperturbed degenerate states Ωa and the state b belongs to a sb-dimensional subspace
of unperturbed degenerate states Ωb. The projectors on these subspaces we denote by P (0)
, respectively.
We denote the states coming from Ωa by |nai and the states coming from Ωb by |nbi. We will also assume that on an
intermediate stage of the calculations a non-zero photon mass µ is introduced. It is considered to be larger than the
energy splitting of the initial and ﬁnal states under consideration and much smaller than the distance to other levels.

We are interested in the analytical properties of Gγf as a function of two complex variables E′ and E in the region
E′ ≈ E(0)
a . These properties can be studied using the complete spectral representation of this type Green
function which is given in Appendix E (a similar representation was derived in Ref. [58]). As it follows from the spectral
representation, the terms which are omitted in equation (3.16) are regular functions of E′ or E when E′ ≈ E(0)
and
E ≈ E(0)
a . The equation (3.16) and the spectral representation given in Appendix E show that, for a non-zero photon
mass µ, the Green function Gγf (E′, E) has isolated poles in variables E′ and E at the points E′ = Enb and E = Ena ,
respectively. Let us now introduce a Green function gγf ,b;a(E′, E) by

starting from the lower-lying bound states. Comparing equation (3.18) with equation (3.9) and taking into account
the biorthogonality condition (2.71) we obtain the desirable formula [26]

The Green function Gγf is constructed by perturbation theory after the transition in (3.25) to the interaction repre-
sentation and using Wick’s theorem. The Feynman rules for Gγf diﬀer from those for G considered in the previous
section only by presence of an outgoing photon line which corresponds to the wave function of the emitted photon
Aν∗
f (x). The Feynman rule for a vertex in which a real photon is emitted remains the same as for a virtual photon
vertex. The energy variable of the emitted photon (k0) in the expression corresponding to a real photon vertex is
considered as a free variable (k0 6= k0
f = |kf|) which, due to the energy conservation, can be expressed in terms of the
initial (E) and ﬁnal (E′) atomic energy variables.

B. Transition probability in a one-electron atom

To demonstrate the practical ability of the formalism, in this section we derive formulas for the transition probability
in a one-electron atom to zeroth and ﬁrst orders in α. An application of the method for two-electron atoms is considered
in [73].

To zeroth order the transition amplitude is described by the diagram shown in Fig. 29. The formula (3.23) gives

where the superscript indicates the order in α. Here we have taken into account that

Some individual terms in equations (3.47) and (3.48) contain ultraviolet divergences. These divergences arise solely
from the zero- and one-potential terms in the expansion of the electron propagators in powers of the Coulomb potential.
Using the standard expressions for the divergent parts of the zero- and one-potential SE terms (see, e.g., [24]) and
the Ward identity (Z1 = Z2) one easily ﬁnds that the ultraviolet divergences cancel each other in equation (3.47). As
to equation (3.48), the divergent parts incorporate into the charge renormalization factor (e = Z 1/2

3 e0).

An alternative approach to the renormalization problem consists in using from the very beginning the renormalized
ﬁeld operators ψR = Z −1/2
3 e0 and,
respectively, the renormalized Green functions. In this approach, additional counterterms arise in the Feynman rules.
The vertex and reducible contributions to the SE corrections (third and fourth terms in equation (3.47)) contain

In addition to the QED corrections derived in this subsection, we must take into account the contribution originating
from changing the photon energy in the zeroth-order transition probability (3.33) due to the QED correction to the
energies of the bound states a and b. It follows that the total QED correction of ﬁrst order in α to the transition
probability is given by

C. Radiative recombination of an electron with an atom

In calcualtions of processes which contain a free electron in the initial or ﬁnal (or in both) states we consider that
the interaction with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus VC(x) is included in the source ˜j(x) which leads to a scattering
[52],

(i 6∂ −m)ψ(x) = ˜j(x) .

(3.52)

It means that, after the transition to the ”in” operators, the unperturbed Hamiltonian does not contain the interaction
with the Coulomb potential. As a result, the Feynman rules contain free-electron propagators, instead of the bound-
electron ones, and the vertices corresponding to the interaction of electrons with VC(x) appear. Since we consider the
case of a strong Coulomb ﬁeld, we will sum up inﬁnite sequences of Feynman diagrams describing the interaction of
electrons with the Coulomb potential. As a result of this summation, the free-electron propagators are replaced by

where H = H0 + VC and H0 = −iα· ∇ + βm, and the free-electron wave functions are replaced by the wave functions
in the Coulomb ﬁeld. For instance, the wave function of an incident electron with momentum pi and polarization µi
is

Consider the process of the radiative recombination of an electron with momentum pi and polarization µi with an
(N − 1)-electron atom X (Z−N +1)+ in a state a. As a result of the process the N-electron atom X (Z−N )+ in a state b
and a photon with momentum kf and polarization ǫf = (0, ǫf ) arise,

e−(pi, µi) + X (Z−N +1)+(a) → γ(kf , ǫf ) + X (Z−N )+(b) ,
where kf = (k0
f = |kf|. In this section we will assume that we consider a non-resonance process. It
means that the total initial energy (p0
i + Ea) is not close to any excited state energy of the N -electron atom. As to
the resonance recombination, a detailed description of this process is given in [33] (see also the next sections of this
paper).

As in the derivation of the formulas for the transition amplitudes, we will assume that in zeroth approximation the
initial and ﬁnal states are degenerate in energy with some other states and will use the same notations for these states
as in section III A. As usual, we also assume that a non-zero photon mass µ is introduced. The spectral representation
of Gγf ;ei(E′, E, p0), which can be derived in the same way as for the Green function describing the transition amplitude
(see section IIIA and Appendix E), gives

representation. Since we have not included the interaction with VC in the unperturbed Hamiltonian, the Feynman
rules contain the free electron propagators and the verteces corresponding to the interaction with VC. Summing over
all the insertions of the verteces with VC in the electron lines we replace the free electron propagators and wave
functions by the electron propagators and wave functions in the Coulomb ﬁeld according to equations (3.53) (3.54).
The free wave function of the incident electron Upiµi (x) is replaced by the wave function ψpiµi(+)(x) which can be
determined from the equation

(3.68)

The wave function ψpiµi(+)(x) is a solution of the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential VC(x) which satisﬁes
the boundary condition [74]

ψpµ(+)(x) ∼ Upµ(x) + G+(ˆn)

exp (i|p||x|)

(3.69)

where G+(ˆn) is a bispinor depending on ˆn ≡ x/|x|. The apparent expressions for ψpµ(+)(x) are given in [74]. Thus,
we again revert to the Furry picture. The Feynman rules for Gγf ;ei diﬀer from those for Gγf only by a replacement
of one of the incoming electron propagators i

2π S(ω, x, y) by the wave function ψpiµi(+)(x).

In calculations by perturbation theory a problem appears which is caused by the fact that in zeroth approximation
the energy of the N − 1-electron atom may coincide with the diﬀerence of the N -electron energy and the one-electron
energy. As a result, some of the terms which are omitted in equation (3.61) are singular functions of E′ and E when
E′ ≈ E(0)
a . A special analysis of the complete spectral representation of the Green function Gγf ,ei shows
that to eliminate these terms in calculations by formula (3.64) one may use the following prescription: integrate ﬁrst
over E and keep the point E = E(0)

and E ≈ E(0)

) outside the contour Γa.

In Refs. [41,42] this method was used to derive formulas for the QED corrections to the radiative recombination of
an electron with a bare nucleus and for the interelectronic-interaction corrections to the radiative recombination of
an electron with a high-Z heliumlike atom. Below we consider another application of the method.

D. Radiative recombination of an electron with a high-Z hydrogenlike atom

As a practical application of the method, in this section we derive formulas for the radiative recombination of an
electron with a high-Z hydrogenlike ion to zeroth and ﬁrst orders in 1/Z. We will assume that the ﬁnal state of the
heliumlike ion is described by a one-determinant wave function

ub(x1, x2) =

√2XP

(−1)P ψP b1 (x1)ψP b2 (x2)

(3.70)

and the one-electron state |b1i coincides with the initial state |ai of the hydrogenlike ion.

To the zeroth order the radiative recombination amplitude is described by the diagram shown in Fig. 32. The

formula (3.65) gives

The ﬁrst term in equation (3.80) is conveniently devided into irreducible (εn 6= E(0)
b − εa = εb2 ) and reducible
(εn = εb2) parts. Since we consider the case of a single ﬁnal state described by the one-determinant wave function
(3.70) with |b1i = |ai, the condition εn = εb2 means |ni = |b2i (otherwise hP b1P b2|I(ω)|ani = 0). Substituting (3.80)
into (3.78), integrating over E and E′ according to the rule formulated above and using the identity (2.127), one ﬁnds

E. Photon scattering on an atom

Let us consider the scattering of a photon with momentum ki and polarization ǫi = (0, ǫi) on an atom being initially
in a state a. As a result of the scattering, a photon with momentum kf and polarization ǫf = (0, ǫf ) arises and the
atom comes to a state b. In this section we consider the non-resonance photon scattering. This means that the total
initial energy of the system (Ea + k0
i ) is not close to any excited state energy of the atom. The resonance photon
scattering will be considered in detail in the next section.

According to the standard reduction technique (see, e.g., [24]), the amplitude of the process is

where |ai and |bi are the vectors of the initial and ﬁnal states in the Heisenberg representation; kf = (k0
ki = (k0

f , kf ) and
i , ki). The ﬁrst term in the right-hand side of equation (3.89) corresponds to a non-scattering process (the

photon does not interact with the atom). We are interested in the second term which describes the photon scattering
on the atom. Let us designate this term by Sscat

γf ,b;γi,a.

To derive the calculation formula for Sscat

γf ,b;γi,a we isolate in the scattering amplitude a term which describes the

scattering of the photon by the Coulomb potential VC. With this in mind, we write

hb|T j(y)j(z)|ai = hb|[T j(y)j(z) − h0|T j(y)j(z)|0i]|ai + δabh0|T j(y)j(z)|0i .

(3.90)

The second term in the right-hand side of this equation corresponds to the photon scattering by the Coulomb ﬁeld
and the ﬁrst term describes the photon scattering by the atomic electrons. Since only diagrams in which the incident
photon is connected at least with one external electron line contribute to the ﬁrst term, we denote this term by

It can be shown that the terms which are omitted in equation (3.94) are regular functions of E′ or E when E′ ≈ Eb
and E ≈ Ea. As in the previous sections of this paper, we assume that in the zeroth approximation the initial and

as above. As usual, we also assume that a non-zero photon mass µ is introduced. We deﬁne the Green function

F. Resonance scattering: Spectral line shape

The formulas for the scattering amplitudes derived above allow one to perform calculations by perturbation theory
in the case when the total initial energy of the system is not close to the energy of an intermediate quasistationary
state. This is so-called non-resonance scattering. In the case of the resonance scattering, when the initial energy of
the system is close to an intermediate state energy, the direct calculation by perturbation theory according to the
formulas derived above leads to some singularities in the scattering amplitude. It means that these formulas can not
be directly applied to the resonance processes. In this section we formulate a method which allows one to calculate
the resonance scattering amplitudes. This method was worked out in Ref. [29]. Another approach, which is limited
to the one-electron atom case, was previously developed in Ref. [75]. An attempt to describe a decay process within
QED was undertaken in Ref. [76].

i ∼ Ed(d = 1, ..., s), where Ea is the ground state energy of the atom, k0

Let us consider the photon scattering on an atom being initially in its ground state ”a” in the case of resonance
Ea + k0
is the incident photon energy,
and Ed(d = 1, ..., s) are the energies of intermediate atomic states which in zeroth order approximation are equal
to the unperturbed energy E(0)
of a degenerate level. We consider that, as a result of the scattering, a photon of
energy k0
i is emitted and the atom comes again to its ground state a. The calculation of the photon scattering
amplitude by the formula derived above leads to a singularity which is caused by the fact that in a ﬁnite order of the
perturbation theory one of the energy denominators of an intermediate Green function is close to zero. It means that
in the calculation of the Green function gcon
γf ,a;γi,a(E′, E, k′0) we have to go beyond the ﬁnite order approximation.
With this in mind, let us represent gcon

f = k0

γf ,a;γi,a(E′, E, k′0) as

d

γf ,a;γi,a(E′, E, k′0) which is regular at
γi are constructed by perturbation theory from equation (3.102)
which must be considered as their deﬁnition. Taking into account equation (2.64) und using the formula (3.97) we
obtain

(3.103)

Consider now how the intermediate Green function gd(Ea + k0
Vd(E) by

i ) can be calculated. Let us introduce a quasipotential

gd(E) = g(0)

d (E) + g(0)

d (E)Vd(E)gd(E) ,

(3.104)

where g(0)
(3.104) which must be considered as its deﬁnition. This equation yields

d /(E − E(0)

d = P (0)

d ). The quasipotential Vd(E) is constructed by perturbation theory according to equation

Vd(E) = [g(0)

d (E)]−1 − [gd(E)]−1 = [g(0)
= [g(0)

d (E)]−1 − [g(0)
d (E)]−1g(1)

d (E)[g(0)

d (E) + g(1)

d (E) + ···]−1

d (E)]−1 + ··· .

(3.105)

When the quasipotential Vd(E) is constructed from equation (3.105) to a ﬁnite order of the perturbation theory, the
Green function gd is determined by

gd(E) = [E − E(0)

d − Vd(E)]−1 .

(3.106)

The Green function gd(E) has poles on the second sheet of the Riemann surface, slightly below the right-hand real
semiaxis (see Fig. 5), and has no singularities for real E when E ∼ E(0)
d . It means, in particular, that if we take the
quasipotential at least to the lowest order approximation ( V (E) ≈ V (E(0)
d ) ), the Green function gd(E) calculated by
equation (3.106) has no singularities at E ∼ Ed(d = 1, ..., s), and, therefore, the calculation of the resonance scattering

46

amplitude by equation (3.103) will be correct. The calculation of gd(E) by equation (3.106) corresponds eﬀectively
to summing an inﬁnite subsequence of Feynman diagrams.

For calculation of gd(E) to the lowest order approximation it is convenient to introduce an operator H by

H ≡ E(0)

d + Vd(E(0)

d ) .

(3.107)

The operator H is not Hermitian and has complex eigenvalues. We assume that H is a simple matrix, i.e.
its
eigenvectors form a full basis in the space of the unperturbed d-states. We denote its eigenvalues by Ed = Ed − iΓd/2,
the right eigenvectors by |dRi, and the left eigenvectors by |dLi. It means
hdL|H = hdL|Ed .

H|dRi = Ed|dRi ,

(3.108)

It is convenient to normalize the vectors |dRi, |dLi by the condition

They satisfy the completeness condition

For gd(E) we obtain

hdL|d′

Ri = δdd′ .

sXd=1

|dRihdL| = I .

gd(E) ≈ (E − H)−1 =

sXd=1

|dRihdL|
E − Ed

.

(3.109)

(3.110)

(3.111)

In fact, due to T -invariance Hik = Hki. For this reason the components of the vector hdL| can be chosen to be equal
to the corresponding components of the vector |dRi. In other words, the components of the vector |dRi are equal to
the complex conjugated components of the vector |dLi. If among the d states there are ones with diﬀerent quantum
numbers, such as the total angular momentum or the parity, for them we have |dRi = |dLi ≡ |di.
Substituting the lowest order approximation for gd(E) given by equation (3.111) into (3.103) we obtain in the
resonance approximation

G. Resonance photon scattering on a one-electron atom

In the lowest order the photon scattering on a one-electron atom is described by the diagram shown in Fig. 34.

The contribution of this diagram to the Green function Gγf ,γi is

Let us derive now the quasipotential Vd(E). To the lowest order of the perturbation theory it is deﬁned by the SE and
VP diagrams (see Figs. 12,13). As was derived above (see section II), the contribution of these diagrams to gd(E) is

g(1)
d (E) = g(0)

d (ΣSE(E) + UVP)g(0)

acts in the s-dimensional space of the unperturbed states. In reality, due to the fact that the operators ΣSE and UVP
do not mix states with diﬀerent quantum numbers and among the degenerate one-electron states there are no states
with the same quantum numbers, in the case under consideration the right eigenvectors of H coincide with the left
eigenvectors, |dRi = |dLi ≡ |di. However, to keep a general form of the equations we will use below the right and left
eigenvectors. In the resonance approximation, the amplitude of the process is deﬁned by equation (3.112), where the
operators R(−)
γi are given by equations (3.116), Ea = εa + ha|ΣSE(εa) + UVP|ai is the ground state energy
including the QED corrections of ﬁrst order in α, Ed and −Γd/2 are the real and imaginary parts of an eigenvalue of
H.

Let us discuss, for simplicity, the case s = 2. The second term in the right-hand side of equation (3.121) is not equal
to zero only if the levels (d = 1, 2) have the same quantum numbers. In the opposite case, which has place in the
process under consideration, |dRi = |dLi and, therefore,

Im(ha|eαν Aν∗

|dihd|eαρAρ

i |ai) = 0 .

(3.122)

It follows that the the total cross section given by equation (3.121) is the sum of Lorentz-type terms. As to the
diﬀerential cross section, the second term in equation (3.120) is non-zero even if the states d = 1, 2 have diﬀerent
quantum numbers.

Close levels with identical quantum numbers can appear among double excited states of high-Z few-electron atoms
[77]. As those, we can consider the (2s, 2s)0 and (2p1/2, 2p1/2)0 states of a He-like ion which can arise in the process
of recombination of an electron with a H-like ion. A detailed theory of this process is given in Ref. [33]. The related
calculations are presented in Refs. [30,78].

IV. CONCLUSION

In the present paper we considered in detail the two-time Green function method for high-Z few-electron systems. To
demonstrate the eﬃciency of the method we derived formulas for some corrections to the energy levels, transition and
scattering amplitudes in one-, two-, and three-electron atoms. Many other applications of the method can be found
in Refs. [31–42,79]. In particular, in Refs. [38,39] the vacuum-polarization and self-energy screening corrections to the
energies of lithiumlike ions are derived. The two-photon exchange diagrams for lithiumlike ions are evaluated in Ref.
[79]. The second order two-electron diagrams for quasidegenerate states of heliumlike ions are studied in [40,68,80]. In
Ref. [31], the TTGF method is employed to construct an eﬀective energy operator for a high-Z few-electron atom. In
Ref. [41], this method is used to derive the QED corrections to the radiative recombination of an electron with a bare
nucleus. The interelectronic-interaction corrections to the radiative electron capture of an electron with a heliumlike
ion are considered in [42]. In Ref. [73], the interelectronic-interaction corrections to the transition probabilities in
heliumlike ions are derived.

Concluding, the two-time Green function method provides a uniform and very eﬃcient approach for deriving the
QED corrections to energy levels, transition probabilities, and cross sections of scattering processes in high-Z few-
electron atoms. Using an eﬀective potential instead of the Coulomb potential of the nucleus allows one to extend this
approach to many-electron atoms.

the free ﬁelds, the permutation relations for arbitrary times remain unknown. Due to the time-translation invariance,
Heisenberg’s operators obey the following transformation equation

below.

Let us consider the contribution of a diagram of m-th order in e. This diagram is deﬁned by a certain order of
contractions in equation (B1). The contractions between the electron-positron ﬁelds and between the photon ﬁelds
give the propagators (2.10) and (2.11), respectively. In this Appendix we will use the following representation for
these propagators

all time-ordered versions. Every time-ordered version is conveniently represented by a diagram in which the verteces
are ordered upwards according to the time increase (see, for example, Fig. 35). According to equations (B2) and
(B3), every electron propagator contains a sum over the whole electron-energy spectrum and every photon propagator
contains an integral over the photon momentum. Let us put these sums and integrals in front of the expression for
the time-ordered version of the Feynman diagram under consideration. Then, an electron line is characterized by an
electron energy εn and, according to (B2), gives a factor (here we are interested only in time-dependent terms)

A similar calculation for t′ < t yields an expression which is obtained from (B7) by a replacement E → −E in all the
denominators.
Taking into account that every photon line contracts two vertices, one obtains that at least m/2 denominators in
(B7) have to contain the photon-energy terms and, therefore, do not contribute to the singularities under consideration.
It follows that G(m/2)(E) has isolated poles of all orders till m/2 + 1 at the unperturbed positions of the bound state
energies. The separation of the poles from the related cuts is provided by keeping non-zero photon mass µ. As to the
cuts starting from the lower energy levels, they can be turned down.

To prove the equation (2.56) we have to show that

Using (D1)-(D4) one easily obtains (2.61).

Let us consider the function G(E′, E) deﬁned as

G(E′, E) =Z ∞

dtdt′ exp (iE′t′ − iEt)h0|T A(t′)B(0)C(t)|0i .

the following double spectral representation for G(E′, E)

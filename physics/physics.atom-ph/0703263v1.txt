Abstract.

The magnetic-octupole (M3) and electric-quadrupole (E2) transitions between the
ground state 3d10 1S0 and the lowest excited 3d94s (5/2, 1/2) J = 3 and J = 2 states in
the Ni-like tungsten are shown to exhibit a strong dependence on electron density Ne
in the range of values typical for tokamak plasmas. Remarkably, the total intensity of
these overlapping lines remains almost constant, which may explain the strong emission
in the 7.93 ˚A line observed in tokamak experiments (Neu R et al. 1997 J. Phys. B: At.
Mol. Phys. 30 5057). Utilization of the M3 and E2 line ratios for density diagnostics
in high-spectral-resolution experiments is discussed as well.

Density dependence of forbidden lines in Ni-like W

Since tungsten is considered to be a strong candidate for one of the plasma-facing
components in the next-generation tokamaks, the x-ray spectra from its highly-charged
ions are being actively studied in the fusion devices, e.g. ASDEX Upgrade tokamak
[1, 2], and in electron beam ion traps (EBIT) [3, 4]. The measured spectra are used to
infer diverse and substantial information on plasma parameters and to test advanced
atomic structure theories and collisional-radiative models.

The forbidden radiative transitions from highly-ionized tungsten are routinely
observed in the x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regions [5, 6, 7]. The Einstein
coeﬃcients for forbidden lines strongly depend on the ion spectroscopic charge Zsp, so
that for 40 to 50 times ionized tungsten atoms the electric-quadrupole (E2), magnetic-
dipole (M1) and even magnetic-octupole (M3) transition probabilities are suﬃciently
strong to overcome collisional quenching in low-density plasmas. Since the intensities
of the forbidden lines are sensitive to the balance of radiative and collisional processes,
they often serve as an important diagnostic tool in fusion, astrophysical and laboratory
plasmas (see, e.g., [8]).

[2] and Fig. 1 of Ref.

One of the most prominent lines observed in the x-ray spectra of the highly-charged
tungsten is a spectral line at 7.93 ˚A‡, which originates from the Ni-like ion W XLVII.
(See, for instance, Fig. 4 of Ref.
[3].) This line is, in fact, an
overlap of two forbidden lines, namely, the M3 line 3d10 1S0 − 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3 and the
E2 line 3d10 1S0 − 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)2 with theoretical wavelengths of about 7.94 ˚A and
7.93 ˚A, respectively, as conﬁrmed by several independent calculations [3, 9, 10]. In Ref.
[3] we showed that in order to correctly calculate the intensity of the 7.93 ˚A line in
a low-density plasma of EBIT, one has to accurately take into account both M3 and
E2 transitions. We also discussed the identiﬁcation and population mechanisms for
all four forbidden lines between the ﬁrst excited conﬁguration 3d94s and the ground
state 3d10 1S0. These transitions (see Table 1) are indicated by dot-dashed lines in Fig.
1, which presents the energy structure of the 3d10, 3d94s, and 3d94p conﬁgurations in
the Ni-like tungsten. For such highly-charged heavy ion, the jj-coupling is the most
appropriate coupling scheme, which is conﬁrmed by the level groupping in jj-terms.

It was recently pointed out [11] that the M3 line, with its rather small transition
probability of AM 3 ≈ 9 × 103 s−1, may be collisionally quenched in tokamak plasmas
with electron density Ne ∼ 1014 cm−3, which is about three orders of magnitude higher
than that in an EBIT. To address this problem, we calculate here the intensities of
the 3d10 − 3d94s forbidden lines for a wide range of electron densities Ne from 1011
cm−3 to 1015 cm−3 and electron temperatures Te from 1000 eV to 5000 eV. This span
of densities and temperatures covers the typical values in tokamak experiments [1, 2].
The line intensities are calculated using the collisional-radiative code NOMAD [12]
and the relativistic atomic structure and collision code FAC [13]. The details of our
modelling are described elsewhere [3], the only diﬀerence being the use of the Maxwellian

‡ The wavelength determined from the tokamak spectra [1, 2] was 7.94 ˚A, while our recent EBIT
measurements [3] gave a slightly smaller value of 7.93 ˚A. For consistency, it is the latter wavelength
that is being used throughout this paper.

electron energy distribution function for the thermal tokamak plasma discussed here.
The simulations were performed in the steady-state approximation. Although here we
included six ionization stages from W XLV to W L with total of more than 2400 levels,
the main conclusions can be derived considering only the levels within the Ni-like W
XLVII.

It is convenient to present the obtained results in terms of the line intensities
relative to the strongest dipole-allowed (E1) line in the Ni-like ion, namely, the
3d10 1S0 − 3d94f (3/2, 5/2)1 transition at 5.689 ˚A. These intensity ratios for the four
3d10−3d94s forbidden lines are shown in Fig. 2. At lowest densities, the relative intensity
for the weak M3 line 1S0−(5/2, 1/2)3 (Fig.2(a)) is seen to remain approximately constant
up to Ne ≈ 1012 cm−3. For higher electron densities, it indeed begins to decrease rapidly
due to the collisional quenching of the upper level. However, the relative intensity for
the strong E2 line 1S0 − (5/2, 1/2)2 with transition probability of AE2 ≈ 6 × 109 s−1
increases with density beginning from the same value of 1012 cm−3 (see Fig.2(b)). As
these two lines closely overlap, it is their total intensity that is measured in the tokamak
and EBIT experiments. The total relative intensity, presented in Fig. 3(a), remains
approximately constant over the whole range of densities from 1011 cm−3 to 1015 cm−3.
For instance, at the electron temperature of 4000 eV, which is close to the experimentally
measured values [1, 2], the intensity changes from about 0.78 at the lowest density to
0.76 at 3 × 1013 cm−3 and to 0.73 at 1015 cm−3. Such an interplay between the M3 and
E2 line intensities is certainly not accidental.

For low densities, the primary depopulation channel for the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3 level
is the M3 radiative decay: at Ne = 1011 cm−3 it is almost two orders of magnitude
stronger than collisional depopulation. For higher densities, however, the electron-
impact collisions becomes more important so that at the typical tokamak value of Ne =
3 × 1013 cm−3, the collisional excitation rate from the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3 level is already
4 times larger than the M3 transition probability. It is well known that the collisional
excitation would preferentially go into the nearest levels that can be excited via dipole-
allowed collisions, that is, the levels of the 3s94p conﬁguration (see Fig. 1). Moreover,
the collisional rates are the strongest for those transitions that do not result in the
rearrangement of the core 3d9. Therefore, in terms of jj-coupling, the excitation from
the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3 level with the total angular momentum of the core Jc = 5/2 would
primarily proceed into the (5/2, 1/2) or (5/2, 3/2) terms of the 3d94p conﬁguration.

It is also possible to determine which speciﬁc levels within those terms would be
mainly populated via collisions. The selection rules for the dipole-allowed electron-
impact excitation [14] indicate that for the s − p transitions, the ﬁnal levels should
have total angular momentum Jf diﬀering by not more than one unit from the initial
value Ji. Therefore, the excitation from the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3 level would predominantly
populate the 3d94p levels with Jf = 2, 3, and 4. Indeed, our simulations show that at
Ne = 3 × 1013 cm−3 and Te = 4000 eV this excitation channel amounts to more than
80 % of the total collisional population outﬂux from this level.

The next important step in determination of the population redistribution channels

can be made by considering the radiative decays from the 3d94p levels. Due to the
|∆J| ≤ 1 selection rule, the J ≥ 2 levels of the 3d94p conﬁguration do not have
allowed electric-dipole transitions into the ground state 3d10 1S0. On the other hand,
the Jf = 2 and 3 levels with Jc = 5/2 have strong (A ≈ 1010 − 1011 s−1) E1 decays
into the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)2 level, which is the upper level of the E2 line. (The 3d94p
(5/2, 3/2)4 level decays radiatively back into the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3.) Since the electric-
dipole radiative decays of the 3d94p levels remain the dominant depopulation channel
over a wide range of densities, at least up to Ne ∼ 1021 cm−3, this in turn means that
under the tokamak conditions a signiﬁcant part of the upward population ﬂux from
the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)3 level would be redirected into the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)2 level followed
by the E2 transition into the ground state. Hence, although the collisional population
redistribution between these two levels does modify the M3 and E2 line intensities,
their sum intensity, i.e., the total intensity of the experimentally measured 7.93 ˚A line,
remains almost constant over a large range of densities.

Although this unresolved 7.93 ˚A line seems to be insensitive to Ne, the intensity
ratio of the M3 and E2 lines may become a very sensitive tool for density diagnostics in
tokamak plasmas provided these two lines can be resolved with a high-resolution x-ray

spectrometer. Table 1 shows that the calculated wavelength diﬀerence ∆λ(E2 − M3) is
about (0.009-0.010) ˚A, which is smaller than the experimental resolution of 0.015 ˚A of
Refs. [1, 2]. The Doppler width in a plasma of Te = 4000 eV is approximately 0.003 ˚A,
so that a spectrometer with resolving power on the order of several thousands would be
suﬃcient to reliably resolve the M3 and E2 lines. Figure 3(b) shows that the intensity
ratio IE2/IM 3 monotonically increases from 1.7-2 at Ne = 1013 cm−3 to about 10 at 1014
cm−3, reaching almost 100 at 1015 cm−3. This range of values makes the IE2/IM 3 ratio

very suitable for density diagnostics in tokamaks.

One may ask whether other isoelectronic Ni-like ions might provide better
opportunities for the determination of the density-dependent IE2/IM 3 ratio. Since the
∆n = 0 energy diﬀerence between the (5/2, 1/2)3 and (5/2, 1/2)2 levels of 3d94s varies
as Zsp and the 3 − 4 transition energy is proportional to Z 2
sp, the required resolution
depends on the spectroscopic charge as ∆λ/λ ∼ Zsp. Although the ﬁt of the FAC
calculated results in the range of Zsp = 29 – 58 gives a slightly weaker dependence of
∆λ/λ ∼ Z 0.8
sp , yet it would seem likely that using the elements heavier than tungsten
may ease the spectral resolution requirements. However, this is not the case, primarily
due to a very strong Zsp-dependence, AM 3 ∝ Z 9
sp, for the M3 transition probability,
which follows both from the present FAC calculations and from the results of Ref.
[10]. It is obvious that the increasing AM 3 combined with the 1/Zsp dependence of the
collisional ∆n = 0 rates would shift the ratio sensitivity range towards higher densities,
outside the typical tokamak values. Using elements lighter than tungsten, on the other
hand, would drastically reduce the probability of the M3 decay and thus enhance the
collisional quenching so that the M3 line would hardly be observed. It therefore seems
quite peculiar that tungsten and close elements may be best suitable for such diagnostic
measurements.

Figure 2(c,d) also shows the density dependence of two other forbidden 3d10 −3d94s
lines, namely, the M1 line 1S0 − (3/2, 1/2)1 and another E2 line 1S0 − (3/2, 1/2)2. The
M1 line is extremely weak due to a strong quenching intraconﬁguration M1 decay into
the 3d94s (5/2, 1/2)2 state [3, 5] and can hardly be observed. The second E2 line that
has a high transition probability of A ≈ 4.5 × 109 s−1 exhibits a very weak dependence
on Ne (see Fig. 2(d)), increasing its relative intensity by only about 15 % over the four
orders of magnitude change in Ne. Thus, these two lines cannot be reliably used for
density diagnostics in tokamak plasmas.

To summarize, we discussed here the density dependence of the intensities of the
forbidden 3d10 − 3d94s lines in Ni-like tungsten. While the magnetic-octupole and
electric-quadrupole lines from the lowest excited (5/2, 1/2) term do show a strong
dependence on Ne, the total relative intensity of these overlapping lines does not change
due to collisional redistribution of population between the levels. This may explain the
high intensity of the 7.93 ˚A line in the tokamak experiments. We also showed that
provided a high spectral resolution (λ/∆λ & 2000) is achieved, the ratio of the E2 and
M3 lines from the Ni-like tungsten can be used for density diagnostics in tokamaks.

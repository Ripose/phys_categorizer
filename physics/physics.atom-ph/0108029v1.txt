The global rotational degrees of freedom in the Schr¨odinger equation
for an N -body system are completely separated from the internal ones.
After removing the motion of center of mass, we ﬁnd a complete set of
(2ℓ + 1) independent base functions with the angular momentum ℓ. These
are homogeneous polynomials in the components of the coordinate vectors

and the solutions of the Laplace equation, where the Euler angles do not

appear explicitly. Any function with given angular momentum and given

parity in the system can be expanded with respect to the base functions,

where the coeﬃcients are the functions of the internal variables. With the

right choice of the base functions and the internal variables, we explicitly
establish the equations for those functions. Only (3N

I. INTRODUCTION

For a quantum N-body system with a pair potential, the Schr¨odinger equation is
invariant under spatial translation, rotation, and inversion. It is well known that, due
to the translation symmetry of the system, the wave function can be separated into a
product of two parts. One describes the motion of the center of mass as a free particle,
and the other describes the motion of the system in the center-of-mass frame. It is no
loss of generality to suppose the center of mass of the system to be at rest, so that the
conﬁguration is completely speciﬁed by (N
1, which are
−
usually chosen as the Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj for simplicity [1–3] (see Sec. II). On
the other hand, due to the symmetries of the global rotation and space inversion of the

system, the three rotational degrees of freedom should be separated completely from the
internal ones so that only (3N
6) internal variables, called the shape coordinates in
some papers, are involved both in the functions and in the equations. This is the aim of
this paper.

The hydrogen atom is a typical quantum two-body system, where there is only one
r2.
Jacobi coordinate vector, which is proportional to the relative position vector r = r1 −
The Schr¨odinger equation for the hydrogen atom becomes a partial diﬀerential equation
with respect to three components of r. Because of the spherical symmetry, the angular
momentum is conserved, and the wave function can be expressed as a product of a radial
function φ(r) and a spherical harmonic function Y ℓ

m(θ, ϕ),

Ψℓ

m(r) = φ(r)Y ℓ

m(θ, ϕ),

(1)

where the radial function φ(r) satisﬁes the radial equation containing only one radial
variable. The generalization of this method to a quantum N-body system is an important
and fundamental problem that has been attacked by many groups.

Wigner studied this problem using group theory [4]. The global rotation of a system
can be described by a space rotation R = R(α, β, γ), rotating the center-of-mass frame
into the body-ﬁxed frame, where α, β and γ are the Euler angles. Brieﬂy denoting all the
internal variables for simplicity by ξ, which is invariant in the global rotation, one may
express the wave function with a given angular momentum as Ψℓ
m(α, β, γ, ξ).
Let PS be the transformation operator for a scalar function ψ(x) in the transformation
S, PSψ(x) = ψ(S−1x) (see p. 105 in Ref. [4]). In a rotation S
SO(3), the function
Ψℓ

m(R, ξ) = Ψℓ

m(R, ξ) transforms as

m(R, ξ) was called by Wigner [4] the function belonging to the mth row of the repre-

Ψℓ
sentation Dℓ(SO(3)). Letting R = R(0, 0, 0) be the identity element, one obtains

m′(ξ) = Ψℓ

where φℓ
m′(0, 0, 0, ξ) depends only on the internal variables, called the generalized
radial functions in this paper. Due to the spherical symmetry, one only needs to study the
eigenfunctions of angular momentum with the largest eigenvalue of Lz (m = ℓ), which in
this paper are simply called the wave functions with angular momentum ℓ for simplicity.
Their partners with the smaller eigenvalues of Lz can be calculated from them by the
lowering operator L−. Letting S−1 = R(α, β, γ), one obtains (see Eq. (19.6) in [4])

where the commonly used form of the Dfunction [5] is adopted. In Eq. (2) Dℓ
plays the role of the base function. What Wigner proved is that (2ℓ + 1) functions
ℓm(α, β, γ)∗ constitute a complete set of independent base functions with the angular
Dℓ
momentum ℓ, and any wave function with the angular momentum ℓ can be expanded with
respect to those base functions. Due to the singularity of the Euler angles, the generalized
radial equations satisﬁed by the generalized radial functions are quite diﬃcult to derive
based on Eq. (2). Hirschfelder and Wigner [6] studied the problem of the generalized radial
equations. Later, the generalized radial equations were improved by several authors [7–9].
The equations seem quite cumbersome [7]. In the present paper we are going to rechoose
the base functions as the homogeneous polynomials in the components of the coordinate
vectors so that the derivation of the generalized radial equations becomes very simple.

−

The generalized radial equations for a quantum three-body system have been discussed
in more detail [10–12]. Recently, by making use of the body-ﬁxed frame, the expression
for the kinetic energy operator was built in terms of the partial angular momentum op-
erators and radial derivatives containing (3N
6) internal variables [13,14]. A coupled
angular momentum basis was used to prediagonalize the kinetic energy operator, where
some oﬀ-diagonal elements remain nonvanishing. Those results have been generalized to
nonorthogonal vectors [15,16]. In those calculations, a function with a given angular mo-
mentum was obtained from the partial angular momentum states using Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcients. Since the partial angular momenta are generally not conserved, one has to
deal with, in principle, an inﬁnite number of partial angular momentum states. This
problem also occurs in the hyperspherical harmonic function method and its improved
versions [17–22]. It causes unnecessary degeneracy of the hyperspherical harmonic states
because, as Wigner proved, only (2ℓ + 1) base functions with angular momentum ℓ are
involved in the calculation.

Eckart [1] presented another method, called the principal axis transformation, to dis-
tinguish the global rotation and the internal motion in a classical N-body system. From

Xaj are the ﬁrst three rows of the matrix X and contain (3N

6) internal variables, and the rotational variables
(Euler angles) can be completely separated in the kinetic energy expression from the
internal variables [1]. This approach has been further studied and quantized in recent
years [2,23–25]. The internal coordinates and their conjugate momenta were quantized to
derive the kinetic energy expression through generalized angular momentum operators.
However, the formal formula (5) does not give the explicit functional relation of the inter-
nal coordinates with the components of the Jacobi coordinate vectors, so that the kinetic
energy expression cannot be transformed directly from the usual kinetic energy term in
the Schr¨odinger equation by replacement of variables. It is very diﬃcult to obtain the
wave function on the position vectors rk (or on the Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj) from a
solution on these internal coordinates. The intermediate calculations for the kinetic en-
ergy expression are so complicated that, as said in Ref. [25], the expression for a quantum
six-body system has not been obtained probably due to a few mistakes in calculations.

Let us return to the hydrogen atom problem. After removing the motion of the center
of mass, the conﬁguration space is parametrized in terms of the rectangular coordinates
r = (x, y, z) or the spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ), where r speciﬁes the internal (radial)
motion and (θ, ϕ) specify the overall rotation. There is another way to separate the
rotational degrees of freedom and obtain the same radial function and the radial equation
as those derived from Eq. (1). One may avoid explicitly introducing the rotational angles

that the rotational angles θ and ϕ do not appear explicitly in this approach. Since the
diﬀerential calculus with respect to θ and ϕ is not complicated, this approach is similar
to the traditional one in a two-body system. However, it may be easier in an N-body
system due to the complicated calculus with respect to the Euler angles. In the present
paper we will separate the global rotational variables in the Schr¨odinger equation for an
N-body system from the internal ones by a generalized method following the approach
described above. In our approach, the number of base functions with the given angular
momentum is ﬁnite, but that number in the hyperspherical harmonic function method
and its improved versions [13,17–22] is inﬁnite due to the unconserved partial angular
momenta. We also avoid the heavy diﬀerential calculus with respect to the Euler angles
which is sometimes necessary for expressing kinetic energy operators.

(2ℓ+1) base functions with total orbital angular momentum ℓ, which are the homogeneous
polynomials in the components of Rj and the solutions of the Laplace equation. Then we
will prove that the base functions constitute a complete set, namely, any function with
the angular momentum ℓ and the given parity in the system can be expanded with respect
to the base functions, where the coeﬃcients depend only on the internal variables. Since
the base functions are polynomials, we are able to derive easily the generalized radial
equations satisﬁed by the coeﬃcients explicitly in Sec. IV. The permutation symmetry
for the total wave function when some or all of the particles in the system are identical
particles is discussed in Sec. V. In Sec. VI we will derive the generalized radial equations
in a general case where the Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj (orthogonal vectors) are replaced
by arbitrary coordinate vectors rcj in the center-of-mass frame (nonorthogonal vectors).
In Sec. VII we will discuss a physical application of our approach. Some conclusions are
given in Sec. VIII.

III. BASE FUNCTIONS WITH THE GIVEN ANGULAR MOMENTUM

Because of the spherical symmetry, the angular momentum is conserved. We are going
to discuss the wave functions with the given angular momentum and parity. From the
given form (9), the eigenfunctions of the angular momentum L2 are the homogeneous
polynomials in the components Rjb of the Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj.

For a quantum two-body system, there is only one Jacobi coordinate vector R = r, and
the eigenfunction of the angular momentum is the spherical harmonic function Y ℓ
m(θ, ϕ).
What is the generalization of the spherical harmonic function for a quantum N-body
system? A naive idea for generalization is to introduce the Euler angles, as was done by
Wigner [4,7–9]. Is it necessary to introduce angular variables in the eigenfunction of the
angular momentum?

As is well known, the harmonic polynomial

m(θ, ϕ) is a homogeneous
polynomial of degree ℓ in the components of r, which satisﬁes the Laplace equation as
well as the eigenequation of the angular momentum. It does not contain angular variables
explicitly. The number of linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree ℓ in
the components of r is

The internal variables are invariant in the global rotation and the space inversion of the
system. We are going to construct base functions for angular momentum that do not con-
tain a function of the internal variables as a multiplying factor, because the factor should
be incorporated into the generalized radial functions. The number of linearly independent
homogeneous polynomials of degree ℓ in the components of the Jacobi coordinate vectors

IV. THE GENERALIZED RADIAL EQUATIONS

q (R1, R2), just like the set of Dℓ

From the theorem above, the set of Qℓτ

ℓm(α, β, γ)∗, is a
complete set of base functions with angular momentum ℓ in the quantum N-body system.
Each function with the angular momentum ℓ in the system can be expanded like Eq. (33)
or Eq. (2). However, Eq. (33) has two important characteristics, which make it easier to
derive the generalized radial equations. One is that the generalized harmonic polynomial
Qℓτ
q (R1, R2) is a homogeneous polynomial in the components of two Jacobi coordinate
vectors R1 and R2, where the Euler angles do not appear explicitly. The other is the well
chosen internal variables (22), where the internal variables ζj have odd parity. It is due to
the existence of ζj that Qℓ0
q (R1, R2) appear together in the expansion of
the wave function. By comparison, all internal variables in a quantum three-body system
have even parity (ζj = 0) so that in the expansion (20) of a wave function with a given
parity only the base functions with the same parity appear [3,4,27,28].

q (R1, R2) and Qℓ1

Because of these two characteristics, it is easy to derive the generalized radial equations
by substituting Eq. (33) into the Schr¨odinger equation (6) with the Laplace operator (9).
The main calculation in the derivation is to apply the Laplace operator (9) to the function
Ψℓλ
ℓ (R1, . . . , RN −1) in Eq. (33). The calculation consists of three parts. The ﬁrst is to
apply the Laplace operator to the generalized radial functions ψℓλ

V. PERMUTATION PROPERTY OF WAVE FUNCTIONS

When some or all particles in a quantum N-body system are identical particles, one
has to consider the permutation property of the spatial wave function, which depends on
the total spin of identical particles. Since the spatial wave function Ψℓλ
ℓ (R1, . . . , RN −1)
is expanded with respect to the base functions Qℓτ
q (R1, R2), we need to study only the
property of Qℓτ
q (R1, R2) in the transposition (k, k + 1) between two neighboring particles.
The transformation property of the Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj in the transposition
q (R1, R2) remains
(k, k + 1) was given in Eq.
invariant in the transposition (k, k + 1) with k
3. In the following we are going to study
the transformation property of Qℓτ
q (R1, R2) in the transpositions (1, 2) and (2, 3). Denote
by P1 and P2 the transformation operators for the base function in the transpositions
(1, 2) and (2, 3), respectively. In the following formulas we neglect the argument R1, R2
in Qℓτ
q (R1, R2) and brieﬂy denote sin θ1, sin θ2, cos θ1, and cos θ2 by s1, s2, c1, and c2 for
simplicity.

VI. NONORTHOGONAL VECTORS

Now, we turn to the general case where arbitrary coordinate vectors rcj in the center-of-
mass frame [see Eq. (13)] are used to replace the Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj. In this case
the Laplace operator contains mixed derivative terms [see Eq. (14)]. All the conclusions
in Sec.
III hold for the present case except that the Jacobi coordinate vectors should
be replaced with the coordinate vectors rcj and the volume element of the conﬁguration
space (25) changes due to the linear transformation (13). In particular, the generalized
harmonic polynomial Qℓλ
q (rc1, rc2), where rc1 and rc2 are two
arbitrarily chosen coordinate vectors.

q (R1, R2) now becomes Qℓλ

the function Ψℓλ

6) internal variables. Since Qℓτ

In a quantum N-body system, any function with angular momentum ℓ and par-
1)ℓ+λ can be expanded with respect to the generalized harmonic polynomials
ity (
Qℓτ
q (R1, R2), where the coeﬃcients, called the generalized radial functions, depend only
q (R1, R2) is a homogeneous polynomial in the
on (3N
components of the Jacobi coordinate vectors and a solution of the Laplace equation, we
have derived the generalized radial equations easily. That the rotational variables (the
Euler angles) do not involve in either the generalized radial functions or the equations will
greatly decrease the amount of calculation in solving the Schr¨odinger equation numeri-
cally for the N-body system. As a ﬁrst step, we applied this approach to the calculation
of the energy levels of a helium atom and a positronium ion [29–31]. In the following we
sketch the method and give some more calculation results.

Once the generalized radial equations have been derived, one may choose any other
complete set of internal variables to simplify the calculation. The generalized radial
equations for the new variables can easily be obtained by replacement of variables. In
a Coulombic three-body system, such as a helium atom, we choose the hyperradius ρ

20

and two dimensionless η and ζ as the internal variables, so as to make the potential a
meromorphic function:

ρ =

(49)

where r1 denotes the position vector of the helium nucleus and r2 and r3 the position
vectors of two electrons. After expanding the wave function as a Taylor series with
respect to η and ζ up to the order n, we obtain an ordinary diﬀerential matrix equation
for the coeﬃcients R(ρ). In the real calculation, we calculate the propagating matrix F (ρ)
and its inverse matrix G(ρ) by the Taylor series method instead of the function R(ρ) in
order to avoid the logarithmic singularities at ρ = 0 in the forms of ρa(lnρ)b [32–34]:

ρ

dR(ρ)
dρ

= F (ρ)R(ρ).

(50)

We are able to obtain the energy levels of a helium atom in the diﬀerent spectra 2S+1Le(o)
with high accuracy by choosing n = 10 (for the S and P states) or n = 9 (for the D
states) due to the fast convergence of the series, where S is the total spin of two electrons,
e(o) describes the parity, and L = S, P and D for the angular momentum states.
In
order to compare our calculation results with those by the variational methods where the
nucleus mass is usually assumed to be inﬁnite, we also calculate the energy level with a
large mass ratio M of the nucleus to the electron (M = 1020). Both calculated results
are listed in Table 1 for comparison. Much fewer terms in the truncated series are taken
in our calculation than those in the hyperspherical harmonic function method [22] and in
the variational methods [36].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

−

For a quantum N-body system we have found a complete set of independent base
functions Qℓτ
q (R1, R2) for the given angular momentum and parity. Any function with
1)ℓ+λ in the system can be expanded with respect to
angular momentum ℓ and parity (
the (2ℓ + 1) generalized harmonic polynomials Qℓτ
q (R1, R2), where the combinative coeﬃ-
cients are functions of the (3N
6) internal variables. We have established the generalized
radial equations explicitly. They are simultaneous partial diﬀerential equations in the in-
ternal variables. The number of both the functions and the equations is (2ℓ + 1) when
N
4, and it becomes (ℓ + 1) or ℓ when N = 3, depending on the parity. Only a ﬁnite
number of partial angular momentum states are involved in constructing the generalized
harmonic polynomials Qℓτ
q (R1, R2). That is, the contributions from the remaining partial

angular momentum states have been incorporated into those from the generalized radial
functions. We have generalized the formulas to the case with nonorthogonal vectors.

When establishing the body-ﬁxed frame we ﬁx it with two arbitrarily chosen Jacobi
coordinate vectors R1 and R2. Those two vectors may be replaced with any other two
coordinate vectors according to the characteristics of the physical problem under study.
The choice of the complete set of base functions is not unique. However, the right
choices of both the base functions and the internal variables play a key role in establishing
the generalized radial equations. Those two choices are the main progress of the present
paper in comparison with the previous work of Wigner [4] and Eckart [1]. Once the
generalized radial equations have been derived, one may choose any other complete set of
the internal variables to simplify the calculation. The generalized radial equations for the
new variables can easily be obtained by replacement of variables, just as we did in Sec.
VII for the three-body system.

The two features in this method, that the numbers of both functions ψℓλ

qτ (ξ, η, ζ) and
equations are ﬁnite, and they depend on only (3N
6) internal variables, are important
for calculating the energy levels and wave functions in a quantum N-body system. In
fact, in the numerical experiments for a quantum three-body system, we calculated the
lowest energy levels of a helium atom in P states [29] and in D states [30] with the total
spin one and zero, and some energy levels of a positronium negative ion [31] by a series
expansion. Because three rotational variables are removed, many fewer terms have to be
taken to achieve the same precision of energy as in other methods to truncate the series
of partial angular momentum states. As the number of particles in the system increases,
we believe that removing three independent variables related to the global rotation will
greatly decrease the amount of calculation.

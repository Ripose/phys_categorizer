We report on trapping of fermionic 40K atoms in a red-
detuned standing-wave optical trap, loaded from a magneto-
optical trap. Typically, 106 atoms are loaded at a density
of 1012 cm−3 and a temperature of 65 µK, and trapped for
more than 1 s. The optical trap appears to be the proper
environment for performing collisional measurements on the
cold atomic sample. In particular we measure the elastic col-
lisional rate by detecting the rethermalization following an
intentional parametric heating of the atomic sample. We also
measure the inelastic two-body collisional rates for unpolar-
ized atoms in the ground hyperﬁne states, through detection
of trap losses.

trapping of a sample of 40K, precooled in a magneto-
optical trap to sub-Doppler temperatures [5]. By using
a compression phase followed by optical molasses cooling
we obtain trapped samples at relatively low temperature
(65 µK) and high density (1012 cm−3). In this tempera-
ture and density regime, our optical trap appears to be
an interesting environment to investigate the collisional
properties of 40K, possibly including the predicted Fesh-
bach resonances. We are indeed able to perform elastic
collisional measurements on unpolarized sample of atoms
in the ground F=9/2 state, and inelastic measurements
on samples in the F=9/2 and F=7/2 hyperﬁne substates,
which are both held in the optical trap. A comparison
with theoretical predictions is made in both cases, and a
good agreement is found.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. LOADING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF

THE OPTICAL TRAP

The fermionic isotope of potassium 40K is among
the most interesting atomic species for the experimental
study of quantum degenerate gases, as early discussed
in [1]. Recently, the possibility of cooling a sample of
fermionic 40K atoms to the regime of quantum degener-
acy has been demonstrated [2], by means of evaporative
cooling in a magnetic trap. This is the ﬁrst step towards
further studies on a dilute Fermi system, including the
possibility of Cooper pairing. As for this prospect, the
presence of Feshbach resonances in the scattering length
of selected Zeeman substates of 40K [3], induced by a
magnetic ﬁeld, could be exploited to bring the required
temperatures for a BCS-like phase transition to a range
experimentally achievable.

Optical traps appear to be very useful tools for inves-
tigating such collisional properties of atoms at low tem-
perature, since they can hold high-density samples in any
spin state, and an homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld can be ap-
plied without modiﬁcation of the trapping potential [4].
For the particular case of 40K, the most interesting Fes-
hbach resonance has been predicted for two spin states
which are not magnetically trappable, and therefore an
optical trap would be necessary [3].

In this paper we report for the ﬁrst time on optical

The optical trap is realized with linearly polarized light
from a single-mode Ti:Sa laser, detuned to the red of both
the D1 and D2 transitions of potassium, respectively at
769.9 nm, and 766.7 nm. The laser radiation is arranged
in a vertical standing-wave conﬁguration, by retroreﬂect-
ing the beam, achieving a 1D optical lattice with the
strongest conﬁnement against gravity. The laser beam is
weakly focused within a two-lens telescope to a waist-size
w0=90 µm, with a Rayleigh length zR=3 cm; the eﬀective
running wave power at the waist position is P=600 mW.
A schematic of the experimental apparatus is shown in
Fig. 1.

The use of a tunable Ti:Sa laser allows us to change in
a continuous way the trap detuning from a few nanome-
ters to about 40 nm, allowing a variety of trap condi-
tions. For a typical wavelength of the trapping laser
λt=787 nm, the calculated trap depth [6] for the ground
state is U0=300 µK (6.2 MHz) and the scattering rate is
Γsc=30 s−1. Since the trapping light is very far detuned
from any transition starting from the excited 4P states,
the light shift for both the excited states is positive, and
it is approximately half of the trap depth.

The vibrational frequencies of each lattice site are

given, in the harmonic approximation, by

ωR = q4U0/M w2

in the axial and radial directions, respectively. Here M is
the mass of potassium. The expected values of the radial
and axial trap frequencies for the conditions above are
respectively 2π×870 Hz and 2π×450 kHz.
The power of the trapping laser can be controlled with
a fast AOM (with a fall time of 300 ns); a polarizer cube
after the AOM provides the required linear polarization.
The pump laser is a low-noise doubled Nd:YVO, and no
active stabilization or tuning of the Ti:Sa laser frequency
is used, to avoid amplitude noise which can possibly heat
up the trapped atoms [7].

We load the optical trap directly from a vapor cell
magneto-optical trap (MOT) of 40K as described in [5].
We note the typical cooling and repumping light inten-
sities of 36 mW/cm2 and 4 mW/cm2 respectively, and
the detuning of the cooling light of -20 MHz from the cy-
cling F=9/2 → F′=11/2 transition (the natural linewidth
and saturation intensities of 40K are Γ=2π×6.2 MHz and
Is=1.8 mW/cm2). In the MOT we collect in 4 s about
5 × 107 atoms at a peak density of 1010 cm−3 and at a
temperature of 60 µK. The dipole trap beam, which is
passing approximately through the center of the MOT,
is left on during the MOT loading, with no detectable
eﬀect on the atom number or temperature.

To load the optical lattice from the MOT we use the
following procedure: the trapped atoms are compressed
for 30 ms by ramping the quadrupole gradient of the
MOT from the normal value of 18 Gauss/cm up to
44 Gauss/cm, while the intensity of the cooling and re-
pumping light are abruptly reduced to 20 mW/cm2 and
0.06 mW/cm2 respectively. Moreover, the detuning of
the cooling light is reduced to -6 MHz to improve the
compression eﬀect. The MOT quadrupole ﬁeld is then
switched oﬀ in 1 ms, and the detuning of the cooling
light is increased to -20 MHz for other 2 ms, providing
the usual optical molasses cooling. Then the MOT beams
are turned oﬀ by switching oﬀ the AOMs in a few µs.
The repumping beams are turned oﬀ 1 ms later than the
cooling ones, to pump the atoms in the lower hyperﬁne
ground state, F=9/2. For a complete shielding of the
optical trap from the resonant stray light of the MOT
beams, which could cause undesired optical excitation
and pumping, we also block the light with a mechanical
shutter within 3 ms from the switch-oﬀ of the AOMs. Us-
ing this procedure, about 5% of the atoms in the MOT
can be loaded in the optical trap, corresponding to a few
106 atoms.

The atoms in the optical trap are probed by turning
on again the MOT beams at half the normal intensity
and in resonance with the cycling transition, while the
repumper is in resonance with the F=7/2 → F′=9/2.
The ﬂuorescence is detected by a photomultiplier with
the help of a lens and of an optical ﬁber with a core
diameter of approximately 0.5 mm, which provides good
spatial selectivity to discard the light scattered by the
windows of the vacuum cell, and allows detection of as
few as 103 atoms. A typical measurement of the lifetime
of the optical trap is shown in Fig. 2. After about 0.3 s

of storage, the decay curve of the atoms pumped in the
ground F=9/2 state is a single exponential, with a 1/e
lifetime of τ =1.4(3) s. We expect the main source of loss
in this regime to be collisions with background gas, the
trap lifetime being roughly one third of the MOT loading
time. The faster decay at shorter times could possibly be
due to losses connected to an evaporative cooling process,
which we will consider below.

Alternatively, the density and the absolute number of
trapped atoms can be measured by absorption imaging,
using a pulse of light derived from the MOT laser lasting
200 µs, at half the saturation intensity and in resonance
with the cycling transition. To compensate for the light
shift due to the optical trap, the frequency is blue shifted
by approximately 1.5U0 from the unperturbed resonance.
The beam is passing through the optical trap in the hor-
izontal plane and is imaged on a CCD camera with a
two-lens system. The distribution of atoms in the op-
tical trap, as shown in Fig. 3, is gaussian in the radial
direction, with a typical FWHM of 70 µm. Also the
axial distribution is generally gaussian, and the typical
FWHM of 500 µm indicates that approximately 1200 lat-
tice sites, spaced by 395 nm, are occupied. The mean
number density is determined by averaging the optical
density over the trap section and scaling by the ratio of
the lattice spacing λt to the the mean axial extension dA
of an individual lattice site. Such mean axial extension is
estimated from the temperature and axial trap frequency
as

dA = ω−1

A p2πkBT /M ,

(2.2)

and is of the order of 100 nm. The typical mean density
of atoms after 100 ms of storage is 7×1011 cm−3, and de-
cays proportionally to the number of atoms for increasing
storage times.

The radial temperature is measured by detecting the
radial extension of the atomic cloud after 1 ms of expan-
sion, following a sudden switch-oﬀ of the optical trap. Al-
ternatively it is possible to estimate the temperature di-
rectly from the radial extensions of the atoms in the trap;
this estimation is aﬀected by a larger uncertainty, since it
relies on the knowledge of the radial trap frequency. The
axial temperature is extracted from the temporal width
of a time-of-ﬂight (TOF) signal, as detected by the ab-
sorption of a 1-cm wide sheet of light placed 1.5 cm be-
low the trapping region, in resonance with the cycling
transition. The TOF beam, generated by an extended-
cavity diode laser, is doubly passing through the vacuum
cell, and the absorption signal is detected with a fre-
quency modulation technique. The typical TOF signal,
as shown in Fig. 4, indicates the presence of two diﬀer-
ent velocity distributions, corresponding to temperatures
around 70 µK for the broad peak and around 4 µK for
the narrow one. We think that the colder component is
due to a small fraction of the trapped atoms which are
adiabatically cooled during the release from the optical
trap. Indeed, the AOM which controls the optical trap

2

is capable of cutting only 95% of the light in less than
300 ns, while the residual tail is extinguished in about
5 µs. Since the latter switch-oﬀ time is longer than ω−1
A ,
the atoms in the bottom of the trap are further cooled
down. We have veriﬁed this conjecture by intentionally
slowing the main switch-oﬀ time of the AOM down to
5 µs, and observing an adiabatic cooling of hotter com-
ponent to 8 µK. We expect to be possible to eliminate
such residual adiabatic cooling eﬀect by using the AOM
in a double-pass conﬁguration, but since this would re-
duce by about 30% the available laser power, we prefer
to ﬁt the TOF signal with a two-component curve to ac-
curately extract the temperature of the majority of the
atoms.

The temperature measurement described above can be
performed only after a minimum storage time of 80 ms,
to allow for the separation of the TOF signal due to the
atoms in the optical trap from the signal due to the atoms
in the MOT which have not been loaded in the trap. We
have veriﬁed that after this time interval the axial and
radial temperature are identical within the uncertainty.
To look for any relationship between the temperatures
of the atoms in the MOT and of those in the optical trap,
we have performed a series of temperature measurements
after 100 ms of storage in optical traps of diﬀerent depths.
The result is shown in Fig. 5: the temperature appears to
scale almost linearly with the trap depth, and for deep
traps we measure a ratio U0/kBT∼4.5. Note that for
very deep traps such a temperature can be much higher
than the MOT one, which is about 70 µK after the com-
pression phase. This behavior, which has been reported
also in [8], seems to indicate that the temperature of the
atoms in the optical trap is determined by the process of
loading and optical trapping itself, and not by the origi-
nal temperature in the MOT.

We note also that the number of atoms loaded in the
trap is observed to decrease almost linearly with the trap
depth, with the density decreasing even faster due to
the accompanying reduction in the spring constant of the
trap. As a result, the optimal density conditions for per-
forming collisional measurements are found only at large
trap depths, where the temperature of the trapped atoms
is comparable to that of the MOT. A detailed descrip-
tion of these observations goes beyond the scope of this
paper, and will therefore be presented elsewhere.

We have also observed that the temperature of the
atoms in the optical trap remains almost constant with
time, although the calculated scattering rate would lead
to a constant heating with a rate as large as 100 µKs−1 for
the tightest trap investigated. Also this result is suggest-
ing the presence of an evaporative cooling eﬀect, which
counteracts the heating due to photon scattering.

The eﬀective trap depth and spring constants are mea-
sured with the help of a parametric heating technique [9].
If the power of the trap light is sinusoidally modulated
by the AOM, a strong heating of the atoms, accompanied
by trap losses, arises whenever the modulation frequency
matches twice the trap oscillation frequency or a subhar-

monic thereof. By monitoring the trap population after
∼100 ms of parametric heating it is therefore possible to
measure both radial and axial trap frequency with an un-
certainty of the order of 10%. A typical measurement of
the trap frequencies is shown in Fig. 6, for a trap depth
of 180 µK. Note the presence of a strong resonance also
at four times the axial frequency, which can be explained
only by considering the anharmonicity of the optical trap
in the axial direction, due to its sinusoidal shape [10].

III. COLLISIONAL MEASUREMENTS

A. Elastic collisions

To characterize the elastic collisions we use a technique
which has already proved useful in this kind of optical
trap [4], which is based on the detection of the rether-
malization of the trapped atoms after the excitation of
one of the degrees of freedom. In particular, we paramet-
rically excite the axial vibrational mode of the trap by
applying a 2% modulation to the laser power for about
5 ms, and measure the subsequent rapid increase of the
axial temperature, followed by an exponential decay due
to thermalization of the axial mode with the radial ones,
as mediated by elastic collisions. In order to excite uni-
formly the atoms distributed over the vibrational levels
in the anharmonic trap, we sweep the modulation fre-
quency roughly between ωA and 2ωA during the 5 ms
heating phase. Indeed, if only a single frequency is used,
we observe a large loss of atoms from the trap, with no
larger increase of the temperature, as if only the popula-
tion of a few levels were excited. Moreover, modulation
amplitudes larger than 2% cause quite a large loss of
atoms, which are detected by the TOF beam together
with those released from the trap, therefore altering the
temperature measurements. The decay curve for the con-
ditions T = 65µK, n=7.5×1011 cm−3, is shown in Fig. 7;
each data point is the average of two series of about 20
TOF measurements, and the original temperature was
67 µK. The ﬁt to an exponential decay yelds τth=10(2) s.
We have checked that the decay time is halved, within
the uncertainty, when the atomic density in the optical
trap is halved, to verify that the rethermalization is ac-
tually mediated by elastic collisions, and not simply by
cross-dimensional anharmonic eﬀects.

We compare the observed collision rates with the re-
sults of a full close-coupling numerical calculation with
the standard Hamiltonian including hyperﬁne structure.
The model is parametrized by the long range dispersion
coeﬃcients of the atom-atom interaction potential and
by single channel singlet and triplet scattering lengths.
We adopt the high precision value C6 =3897au from Ref.
[11] for the van der Waals coeﬃcient, and choose the
range of possible scattering lengths by scaling to 40K the
results obtained for 39K from an analysis of the 0−
g [12]
molecular state photoassociation spectroscopy. Similar

3

but less restricted values are also presented in [13] from
an analysis of the 1g spectrum. We obtain in this way
the limits 100 < as <110a0 and 150 < at <250a0.
It
is consistent with the experimental errors in the present
measurements to ﬁx the singlet scattering length to say
as = 105a0 and leave only the triplet as a free parameter.
From our calculation and from the results of an anal-
ogous experiment performed in a magnetic trap [14], we
expect that both s- and p-wave collisions are contribut-
ing to the cross sections at T =65 µK for 40K. Indeed, a
p-wave shape resonance close to threshold enhances the
p-wave contribution at low temperatures [14,15]. Since
our sample is unpolarized we calculate spherical s and p
cross sections σ, and estimate the thermalization rate as

1
τth

= (cid:0)

σs
αs

+

σp
αp(cid:1)nv

(3.1)

where α is the average number of collisions necessary for
the rethermalization, n is the atomic density, and v is
the rms relative velocity between two colliding atoms.
Note that we have implicitly assumed an identical dis-
tribution of all possible spin states in F=9/2 over the
optical trap, since the trap potential is independent of
the magnetic moment of the atoms. We adopt for the
parameters α the values αs = 2.5 and αp = 4.1 quoted in
[14]. We ﬁnd the best agreement with the measured rate
at the lowest allowed value of the triplet scattering length
(at=150a0), i.e. when the p-wave resonance is closer to
threshold.
In this situation the average thermal rates
are σsv=6.2 × 10−11cm3/s and σpv=1.75 × 10−10cm3/s
and the characteristic time for rethermalization for the
given density in the trap is then about τth=20 ms. It is
interesting to notice that a comparison between the pho-
toassociation results in [12] and [13] seems to privilege
lower values of at in agreement with what we ﬁnd here.
From the calculated elastic collision rate 1/τel ≡ nσv,
with σ the total cross section, is also possible to estimate
the typical speed of the thermalization due to evaporative
cooling processes. Using the formalism presented in [16],
the ratio of the evaporation to the elastic collision time
constant is

√2 eηη−1

τev/τel ≈

(3.2)
where η=U0/kBT . From the measured value of η ∼ 4.5
(see Fig. 5), the timescale for the thermalization due
to evaporation is therefore expected to be a few hun-
dreds of ms. Although this process can be neglected with
regard to the cross-dimensional collisional processes re-
ported above, which are proceeding at a much faster rate,
we speculate that it could play an important role in the
observed long term stability of the temperature of the
atoms in the optical trap.

B. Inelastic collisions

The inelastic two-body collisions between atoms in
the F=7/2 state, and between atoms in the F=9/2

4

and F=7/2 states, can be detected in a relatively easy
way through trap losses, since the hyperﬁne energy of
1.285 GHz released under the transition F=7/2→9/2 is
much larger than the trap depth. We can vary the pop-
ulation of the upper hyperﬁne state F=7/2 by means of
an optical pumping beam, derived from the MOT laser,
in resonance with the F=9/2→F′=7/2 transition, and
controllable in intensity with an AOM. By shining the
beam on the trapped atoms with an intensity of about
10 µW/cm2, and for a time interval variable between 0.1
and 2 ms, we transfer up to 95% of the atoms from the
ground to the upper state. The relative populations of
the two hyperﬁne states after the pumping pulse are mea-
sured by monitoring the TOF signal, to which only the
atoms in F=9/2 contribute. We have veriﬁed that the
typical time scale for hyperﬁne optical pumping due to
inelastic Raman scattering of the trap photons is much
longer than 1 s, and therefore such eﬀect is negligible.

The optical pumping pulse is applied after about
100 ms from the loading of the dipole trap, to let the
trapped atoms equilibrate, and then the decay of the
number of atoms in the trap is measured with the usual
procedure.
In Fig. 8 the decay of the trapped atoms
is shown for the cases of 95% and 85% of the total
population pumped into the F=7/2 state. In this par-
ticular measurement the temperature of the atoms was
T =50 µK. We ﬁt the experimental data by assuming a
constant volume regime, which in an harmonic trap is
equivalent to the assumption of a constant temperature.
In this regime, the density is proportional to the num-
ber of atoms, and the decay curves are the solutions of
the coupled diﬀerential equations for the densities of the
populations in both hyperﬁne states

˙n1 = − γn1 − G1,2n1n2
˙n2 = − γn1 − 2G2,2n2

2 − G1,2n1n2 .

(3.3)

(3.4)

Here the suﬃxes 1 and 2 refer to the levels F=9/2 and
F=7/2, respectively, γ is the rate of linear trap loss, and
Gi,j is the spherical rate of two-body inelastic collisions
between atoms in states i and j at temperature T . To
account for the loss of both atoms in the pair for each
collision event, factors of 2 are added for collisions of
atoms belonging to the same hyperﬁne level.

The constant γ can be obtained from the tails of the
decay curve, where the binary collision rate is negligible.
The ﬁt yields γ=(0.90±0.05) s−1. We keep this value
ﬁxed for the ﬁts where we have 95%, 83% and 66% of
the atoms in F=7/2. We assume a 30% uncertainty in
the atomic density and obtain best estimates of the decay
rates from the individual curves. Next we combine the
three measurements to obtain G7/2,7/2=3.2×10−11 cm3/s
and G9/2,7/2=3.8×10−12 cm3/s with an uncertainty of
the order of 50%. From numerical calculations we ﬁnd
thermally
averaged spherical rates of G7/2,7/2=4.4×10−11 cm3/s
and G9/2,7/2=3.5×10−12 cm3/s for T =50µK, in agree-
ment with the measured rate. We obtain these values at

the optical trap. We also acknowledge contributions by

the lower edge a3=150a0 of the initial conﬁdence range.
The agreement holds until the value a3 ≃ 180a0, where
the loss coeﬃcient G9/2,7/2 drops to values of the order of
G9/2,7/2 ≃ 10−12 cm3/s. In all this range p-wave losses
provide a signiﬁcant contribution to both G7/2,7/2 and
G9/2,7/2, and the agreement with the measured values
represents therefore further evidence of the presence of
a low energy p-wave resonance. It is interesting to no-
tice that the rate coeﬃcient G(9/2, 7/2) rapidly increases
above a3=180a0, reaching values larger than 10−11 cm3/s
for a3 > 190a0, in disagreement with the measured value.
This seem to rule out the higher range of a3 values, as
already indicated by the large observed rethermalization
rate. We also note that inelastic collisions cannot be re-
sponsible for the faster decay of the atom number at short
trapping times (see Fig. 2), even assuming a residual 5%
on the F=7/2 state after the normal loading of the optical
trap, due to the relatively small value of G9/2,7/2.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have reported on loading of fermionic 40K atoms
in a 1D optical lattice from a single MOT. The 1.4-s
lifetime of the optical trap is large enough to allow the
observation of elastic and inelastic collisional processes,
due to the high density of the atomic sample in the trap.
Indeed, the typical time scale for collisional processes is
a few tens of ms, at a density of 7×1011 cm−3 and at
a temperature of 65 µK. Furthermore, optical pumping
and heating eﬀects arising from the scattering of trap
photons do not seem to play a signiﬁcant role on such
time scale.

The experimental collisional rates for unpolarized sam-
ples we determine are quite consistent with the theoreti-
cal expectations. Further studies of inelastic and elastic
collisions in spin-polarized samples in our optical trap
could lead to a characterization of the collisional prop-
erties of fermionic potassium at low temperature. As
already noted, particularly interesting is the possibility
of searching for the occurrence of s-wave Feshbach reso-
nances in the collisions between Zeeman sublevels of the
ground state. For such purpose, a temperature lower
than the present 65 µK would be preferred, to reduce the
p-wave contribution, and to avoid temperature broaden-
ing of the resonance. Although the temperature can be
lowered by loading the atoms in very shallow traps, the
achieved density is not large enough to perform accurate
collisional measurements, and therefore methods for re-
ducing the temperature of a dense sample are needed. In
particular, we note that the axial degree of freedom of
our trap is in the Lamb-Dicke regime (dA ≪ λ), allowing
for the application of fast degenerate Raman sideband
cooling [17], which would allow for an eﬃcient reduction
of the temperature without atom losses.

FIG. 2. Decay of the number of atoms in the optical trap,
in the ground state F=9/2. The ﬁt with an exponential decay
yields a time constant of 1.4 s.

FIG. 4. Typical TOF signal from the atoms in the opti-
cal trap. The narrow peak is due to atoms which have been
adiabatically cooled during the release from the trap. The
continuos line is the best ﬁt with a two-component TOF dis-
tribution, which gives the reported temperatures.

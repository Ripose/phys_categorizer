A three-body scattering process in the presence of Coulomb interaction can be decomposed formally
into a two-body single channel, a two-body multichannel and a genuine three-body scattering. The
corresponding integral equations are coupled Lippmann-Schwinger and Faddeev-Merkuriev integral
equations. We solve them by applying the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion method. We
present elastic scattering and reaction cross sections of the e+ + H system both below and above
the H(n = 2) threshold. We found excellent agreements with previous calculations in most cases.

tions has not yet allowed any direct solution. However,
use of integral equations is a very appealing approach
since no boundary conditions are required.

Recently, one of us has developed a novel method for
treating the three-body problem with repulsive Coulomb
interactions in three-potential picture [3].
In this ap-
proach a three-body Coulomb scattering process can be
decomposed formally into a two-body single channel, a
two-body multichannel and a genuine three-body scat-
tering. The corresponding integral equations are coupled
Lippmann-Schwinger and Faddeev-Noble integral equa-
tions, which were solved by using the Coulomb-Sturmian
separable expansion method. The approach was tested
ﬁrst for bound-state problems [4] with repulsive Coulomb
plus nuclear potential. Then it was extended to calculate
p − d scattering at energies below the breakup threshold
[3] and more recently we have used the method to cal-
culate resonances of three-α systems [5]. Also atomic
bound-state problems with attractive Coulomb interac-
tions have been considered [6]. These calculations showed
an excellent agreement with the results of other well es-
tablished methods. The eﬃciency and the accuracy of
the method was demonstrated.

The aim of this paper is to generalize this method
for solving the three-body Coulomb problem with re-
pulsive and attractive Coulomb interactions. We com-
bine the concept of three-potential
formalism with
the Merkuriev’s splitting of the interactions and solve
the resulting set of Lippmann-Schwinger and Faddeev-
Merkuriev integral equations by applying the Coulomb-
Sturmian separable expansion method.
In this paper
we restrict ourselves to energies below the three-body
breakup threshold.

The three-body Coulomb scattering problem is one
of the most challenging long-standing problems of non-
relativistic quantum mechanics. The source of the dif-
ﬁculties is related to the long-range character of the
Coulomb potential.
In the standard scattering theory
it is supposed that the particles move freely asymptoti-
cally. That is not the case if Coulombic interactions are
involved. As a result the fundamental equations of the
three-body problems, the Faddeev-equations, become ill-
behaved if they are applied for Coulomb potentials in a
straightforward manner.

The ﬁrst, and formally exact, approach was proposed
by Noble [1]. His formulation was designed for solv-
ing the nuclear three-body Coulomb problem, where all
Coulomb interactions are repulsive. The interactions
were split into short-range and long-range Coulomb-like
parts and the long-range parts were formally included in
the ”free” Green’s operator. Therefore the corresponding
Faddeev-Noble equations become mathematically well-
behaved and in the absence of Coulomb interaction they
fall back to the standard equations. However, the asso-
ciated Green’s operator is not known. This formalism,
as presented at that time, was not suitable for practical
calculations.

In Noble’s approach the separation of the Coulomb-like
potential into short-range and long-range parts were car-
ried out in the two-body conﬁguration space. Merkuriev
extended the idea of Noble by performing the splitting
in the three-body conﬁguration space. This was a cru-
cial development since it made possible to treat attrac-
tive Coulomb interactions on an equal footing as repul-
sive ones. This theory has been developed using in-
tegral equations with connected (compact) kernels and
transformed into conﬁguration-space diﬀerential equa-
tions with asymptotic boundary conditions [2]. In prac-
tical calculations, so far only the latter version of the
theory has been considered. The primary reason is that
the more complicated structure of the Green’s operators
in the kernels of the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equa-

I. INTEGRAL EQUATIONS OF THE
THREE-POTENTIAL PICTURE

The long-range Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

α + v(l)

β + v(l)
γ ,

We consider a three-body system with Hamiltonian

and its resolvent operator is

H = H 0 + vC

α + vC

β + vC
γ ,

(1)

G(l)(z) = (z − H (l))−1.

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and
vC
α denotes the Coulomb-like interaction in subsystem
α. The potential vC
α may have repulsive or attractive
Coulomb tail and any short-range component. We use
the usual conﬁguration-space Jacobi coordinates xα and
yα; xα is the coordinate between the pair (β, γ) and yα
is the coordinate between the particle α and the center
of mass of the pair (β, γ). Thus the potential vC
α , the
interaction of the pair (β, γ), appears as vC
α (xα). We
also use the notation X = {xα, yα} ∈ R6.

A. Merkuriev’s cut of the Coulomb potential

The Hamiltonian (1) is deﬁned in the three-body
Hilbert space. The two-body potential operators are for-
mally embedded in the three-body Hilbert space

vC = vC (x)1y.

Merkuriev introduced a separation of the three-body con-
ﬁguration space into diﬀerent asymptotic regions. The
two-body asymptotic region Ωα is deﬁned as a part of
the three-body conﬁguration space where the conditions

|xα| < x0

α(1 + |yα|/y0

α)1/ν ,

α, y0

with x0
α > 0 and ν > 2, are satisﬁed. He proposed to
split the Coulomb interaction in the three-body conﬁgu-
ration space into short-range and long-range terms

α = v(s)
vC

α + v(l)
α ,

where the superscripts s and l indicate the short- and
long-range attributes, respectively. The splitting is car-
ried out with the help of a splitting function ζ,

v(s)(x, y) = vC (x)ζ(x, y),
v(l)(x, y) = vC (x)[1 − ζ(x, y)].

The function ζ is deﬁned such that

ζ(x, y) X→∞
−−−−→

1, X ∈ Ωα
0 otherwise.

(cid:26)
In practice, in the conﬁguration-space diﬀerential equa-
tion approaches, usually the functional form

ζ(x, y) = 2/

1 +

(x/x0)ν /(1 + y/y0)

,

(8)

was used.

(cid:8)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:9)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

Then, the three-body Hamiltonian takes the form

H = H (l) + v(s)

α + v(s)

β + v(s)
γ .

In the conventional Faddeev theory the wave function

components are deﬁned by

|ψαi = (z − H 0)−1vα|Ψi,

(12)

where vα is a short-range potential and |ψαi is the Fad-
deev component of the total wave function |Ψi. While
the total wave function |Ψi, in general, has three dif-
ferent kind of two-body asymptotic channels, |ψαi pos-
sesses only α-type two-body asymptotic channel. The
other channels are suppressed by the short-range poten-
tial vα. This procedure is called asymptotic ﬁltering and
it guarantees the asymptotic orthogonality of the Fad-
deev components [7].

The aim of the Merkuriev procedure was to formally
obtain a three-body Hamiltonian with short-range poten-
tials v(s) and long-range Hamiltonian H (l) in order that
we can repeat the procedure of the conventional Faddeev
theory. The total wave function |Ψi is split into three
components,

|Ψi = |ψαi + |ψβi + |ψγi,

with components deﬁned by

|ψαi = G(l)v(s)

α |Ψi.

(13)

(14)

This procedure is an example of asymptotic ﬁltering. The
short-range potential v(s)
α acting on |Ψi suppresses the
possible β and γ asymptotic two-body channels, pro-
vided G(l) itself does not introduce any new two-body
asymptotic channels. With the Merkuriev splitting this
is avoided because H (l) does not have two-body asymp-
totic channels even if some of the long-range potentials
have attractive Coulomb tail. In the attractive case v(l)
appears as a valley along the y = xν parabola-like curve
with Coulomb-like asymptotic behavior in x at any ﬁnite
y. (See Figs. 1 and 2 for the short- and long-range parts,
respectively). However, as y → ∞ the depth of the valley
goes to zero, consequently the two-body bound states are
pushed up, and ﬁnally the system does not have any two-
body asymptotic channels. We note that the Merkuriev
formalism contains the Noble’s in the limit y0 → ∞.

B. The three-potential picture

In Ref. [3] the three body scattering problem with
repulsive Coulomb interactions were considered in the

2

three-potential picture.
In this picture the scattering
process can be decomposed formally into three consec-
utive scattering processes: a two-body single channel, a
two-body multichannel and a genuine three-body scatter-
ing. This formalism also provides the integral equations
and the method of constructing the S-matrix. Below we
adapt this formalism to attractive Coulomb interactions
along the Merkuriev approach.

The asymptotic Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

and the asymptotic states are the eigenstates of Hα

Hα = H 0 + vC
α ,

Hα|Φαi = E|Φαi,

and

(16)

where hxαyα|Φαi = hyα|χαihxα|φαi is a product of a
scattering state in coordinate yα and a bound state in
the two-body subsystem xα.

The subscript i and j denotes the i-th and j-th eigen-

we substitute (23) into (28) we get the following two

Substituting Eq. (24) into (29), the ﬁrst term yields two
more terms

D. Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations for the
wave function components

The integral equations for the wave function |Ψ(±)
α i are
arrived at by combining the resolvent relation (23) and
Eq. (25). In this case however we have three resolvent
relations and therefore we obtain a triad of Lippmann-
Schwinger equations

Although these three equations together provide unique
solutions [9], their kernels are not connected therefore
they cannot be solved by iterations. The way out of
the problem is to use the Faddeev decomposition which
leads to equations with connected kernels, thus they are
eﬀectively Fredholm-type integral equations.

Multiplying each elements of the triad from left by

Merkuriev showed that after a certain number of iter-
ations these equations were reduced to Fredholm inte-
gral equations of the second kind with compact kernels
for all energies, including energies below (E < 0) and
above (E > 0) the three-body breakup threshold [2].
Thus all the nice properties of the original Faddeev equa-
tions established for short-range interactions remain valid
also for the case of Coulomb-like potentials. We note
that the triad of Lippmann-Schwinger equations and the
set of Faddeev equations describe the same physics, the
equations have identical spectra and in fact, the Faddeev
equations are the adjoint representations of the triad of
Lippmann-Schwinger equations [10].

II. COULOMB-STURMIAN SEPARABLE
EXPANSION APPROACH TO THE
THREE-BODY INTEGRAL EQUATIONS

In order to solve operator equations in quantum me-
chanics one needs a suitable representation for the oper-
ators. For solving integral equations it is especially ad-
vantageous if one uses a representation where the Green’s
operator is simple. For the two-body Coulomb Green’s
operator there exists a Hilbert-space basis in which its
representation is very simple. This is the Coulomb-
Sturmian (CS) basis.
In this representation-space the
Coulomb Green’s operator can be given by simple and
well-computable analytic functions [11]. This basis forms
a countable set. If we represent the interaction term on
a ﬁnite subset of the basis it looks like a kind of sep-
arable expansion of the potential, and so the integral
equation becomes a set of algebraic equations which can
then be solved without any further approximation. The
completeness of the basis ensures the convergence of the
method.

This approximation scheme has been thoroughly tested
in two-body calculations. Bound- and resonant-state cal-
culations were presented ﬁrst [11]. Then the method
was extended to scattering states [12]. Since only the
asymptotically irrelevant short-range interaction is ap-
proximated, the correct Coulomb asymptotic is guaran-
teed [13]. A recent account of this method is presented
in Ref. [14]. The method also proved to be very eﬃcient
in solving three-body Faddeev-Noble integral equations

for bound- [4] and scattering-state [3] problems with re-
pulsive Coulomb interactions.

In subsection A we deﬁne the basis states in two- and
three-particle Hilbert space. In subsection B we review
some of the most important formulae of the two-body
problem. In subsections C and D we describe the calcu-
lation of the S-matrix and the solution of the Faddeev-
Merkuriev integral equations. We follow the line pre-
sented in Ref. [3].

The key point in the whole procedure is the exact

have developed two independent, analytic approaches.
Both are based on the observation that the Coulomb
Hamiltonian possesses an inﬁnite symmetric tridiagonal

result of Ref. [16] is that for Jacobi matrix systems the

trix can be determined by the elements of the Jacobi

(63)

In Ref. [16] it was shown that although the continued
fraction C is convergent only on the upper-half k plane it
can be continued analytically to the whole k plane. This
is because the un and dn coeﬃcients satisfy the limit
properties

un = −1

u ≡ lim

dn = 2(k2 − b2)/(k2 + b2) .

(66)

Therefore the tail w of C satisﬁes the implicit relation

w =

u

,

which is solved by

w± = (b ± ik)2/(b2 + k2) .

(68)

Replacing the tail of the continued fraction by its explicit
analytical form w±, we can speed up the convergence
and, more importantly turn a non-convergent continued
fraction into a convergent one [17]. Analytic continuation
is achieved by using w± instead of the non-converging
tail. In Ref. [16] it was shown that w+ provides an ana-
lytic continuation of the Green’s matrix to the physical,
while w− to the unphysical Riemann-sheet. This way
Eq. (62) together with (61) provides the CS basis repre-
sentation of the Coulomb Green’s operator on the whole
complex k plane. We note here that with the choice of
Z = 0 the Coulomb Hamiltonian (58) reduces to the ki-
netic energy operator and our formulas provide the CS
basis representation of the Green’s operator of the free
particle as well. We emphasize that this procedure does
not truncate the Coulomb Hamiltonian, because all the
higher J nn′ matrix elements are implicitly contained in
the continued fraction.

We note that gC has already been calculated before
[11]. From the J-matrix structure a three-term recursion
relation follows for the matrix elements gC
nn′ . This recur-
sion relation is solvable if the ﬁrst element gC
is known.

where η = Zm/(¯h2k) is the Coulomb parameter and 2F1

exists a continued fraction representation, which is very
eﬃcient in practical calculations. It was shown that the
two methods lead to numerically identical results for all
energies and our numerical continued fraction represen-
tation possesses all the analytic properties of gC . The
exact analytic knowledge of gC allows us to calculate the

C. Calculation of the three-body S-matrix

The aim of any scattering calculation is to determine
the S-matrix elements.
In our case we need to calcu-
late the terms (33), (34) and (44) of the three-potential
picture.

The term S(1)

βj,αi is trivial because it is just the two-

body S-matrix of the Coulomb-like potential u(l)

It should be noted that the approximations (73) and

calculations we increase N until we observe numerical
convergence in scattering observables.

For such systems a single Lippmann-Schwinger equation
provides a unique solution [19].

(99)

The contour C should encircle, in positive direction, the
spectrum of hyα without penetrating into the spectrum
of hxα.

The convolution theorem follows from a more general
formula. A function of a self adjoint operator h is deﬁned
as

f (h) =

dzf (z)(z − h)−1,

(100)

2πi

where C is a contour around the spectrum of h and f
should be analytic on the region encircled by C.

In the following we suppose that u(l) either vanishes
or is a repulsive Coulomb-like potential. This assump-
tion is not necessary but it greatly simpliﬁes the analysis
below. Numerical examples show that there are a great
many physical three-body systems where this condition
is satisﬁed. This condition ensures that hy does not have
bound states.

To examine the analytic structure of the integrand (99)
let us shift the spectrum of gxα by taking z = E + iε
with positive ε.
In doing so, the two spectra become
well separated and the spectrum of gyα can be encircled.
The contour C is deformed analytically in such a way
that the upper part descends to the unphysical Riemann
sheet of gyα, while the lower part of C can be detoured
away from the cut [see Fig. 3]. The contour still encircles
the branch cut singularity of gyα, but in the ε → 0 limit
avoids the singularities of gxα. Thus, the mathemati-
cal conditions for the contour integral representation of

Gα(z) in Eq. (99) is met. The matrix elements

where the corresponding CS matrix elements of the two-

III. TEST OF THE METHOD

We demonstrate the power of this new method by cal-
culating elastic phase shifts of e+ + H scattering below
the P s(n = 1) threshold and cross sections of the e+ + H
elastic scattering as well as p+ + P s reaction channels up
to the P s(n = 2) threshold. In all examples we have to-
tal angular momentum L = 0 and we have taken angular
momentum channels up to l = 10. We use atomic units.
Let us numerate the particles e+, p and e−, with
masses me± = 1me and mp = 1836.1527me, by 1, 2 and
3, respectively. In the channel 3 there are no two-body
asymptotic channels since the particles e+ and p do not
form bound states. Therefore, we can take v(s)
3 ≡ 0 and
include the total vC

3 in the long range Hamiltonian

In this case |ψ3i ≡ 0 and we have the set of two-
component Faddeev-Merkuriev equations

H = H (l) + v(s)
H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

(105)

The parameters of the splitting function ζ of Eq. (8) are
rather arbitrary. The ﬁnal converged results should be
insensitive to their values; our numerical experiences con-
ﬁrm this expectation. For the parameters of ζ we have
taken ν = 2.1, x0 = 3 and y0 = 10, whereas for the
parameters of CS functions we have taken b = 0.9. We
have experienced that the rate of convergence is rather
insensitive on the choice of b over a broad interval.

First we examine the convergence of the results for
cross sections at incident wave numbers k1 = 0.71,
k1 = 0.75 and k1 = 0.8, which correspond to scatter-
ing states in the Ore gap. Table I shows the conver-
gence of e+ + H− > e+ + H elastic scattering (σ11) and
e+ + H− > p+ + P s positronium formation (σ12) cross
sections (in πa2
0) with respect to N , the number of CS
functions in the expansion, and with respect to increas-
ing the angular momentum channels in the bipolar ex-
pansion. For comparison we provide the results of Ref.
[20]. We can see that very good accuracy is achieved even
with relatively low N in the expansion.

In Table II we compare our converged results for phase
shifts (in radians) below the P s(n = 1) threshold to that

of other methods. Ref. [21] is the best variational calcu-
lation. In Ref. [22] the Schr¨odinger equation was solved
by means of ﬁnite-element method. In Refs. [23] and [20]
the conﬁgurations space Faddeev-Merkuriev diﬀerential
equations were solved using the bipolar harmonic expan-
sion method and in total angular momentum represen-
tation, respectively. We can report perfect agreements
with previous calculations.

In Table III we present partial cross sections in
the H(n = 2) − P s(n = 2) gap (threshold energies
0.7496-0.8745 Ry). In Ref. [24] the conﬁgurations space
Faddeev-Merkuriev diﬀerential equations were solved us-
ing the bipolar harmonic expansion in the angular vari-
ables an quintic spline expansion in the radial coordi-
nates. We can report fairly good agreements.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have extended the three-potential formalism for
treating the three-body scattering problem with all kinds
of Coulomb interactions including attractive ones. We
adopted Merkuriev’s approach and split the Coulomb po-
tentials in the three-body conﬁguration space into short-
In this picture the three-
range and long-range terms.
body Coulomb scattering process can be decomposed into
a single channel Coulomb scattering, a two-body multi-
channel scattering on the intermediate-range polarization
potential and a genuinely three-body scattering due to
the short-range potentials. The formalism provides us a
set of Lippmann–Schwinger and Faddeev-Merkuriev in-
tegral equations.

These integral equations are certainly too complicated
for the most of the numerical methods available in the
literature. The Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion
method can be successfully applied. It solves the three-
body integral equations by expanding only the short-
range terms in a separable form on Coulomb-Sturmian
basis while treating the long-range terms in an exact
manner via a proper integral representation of the three-
body channel distorted Coulomb Green’s operator. The
use of the Coulomb-Sturmian basis is essential as it allows
an exact analytic representation of the two-body Green’s
operator, and thus the contour integral for the channel
distorted Coulomb Green’s operator can be calculated.
The method provides solutions which are asymptotically
correct, at least in Ωα, which is suﬃcient if the scattering
process starts from a two-body asymptotic state. Since
the two-body Coulomb Green’s operator is exactly calcu-
lated all thresholds are automatically in the right location
irrespective of the rank of the separable approximation.
The method possesses good convergence properties and
in practice it can be made arbitrarily accurate by em-
ploying an increasing number of terms in the expansion.
Certainly, there is plenty of room for improvement but
we are convinced that this method can be a very power-
ful tool for studying three-body systems with Coulomb

9

interactions.

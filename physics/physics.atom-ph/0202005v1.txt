Abstract

The connection between the quantum frequency of radiation by the transition of the
electron from orbit n to orbit k and frequencies of circling of electron in these orbits for
the atom of hydrogen is determined.

In the atom of hydrogen by the transition of the electron from the orbit n to the orbit k

(n > k) the quantum of energy is radiated

hν = En − Ek .

At present the dependence of quantum frequency of radiation ν from frequency of circling of
electron νn and νk in orbit n and k is not determined. It is only known, that if the quantity
of n is big, by the transition n → n − 1 the quantum frequency ν is nearly equal to the
frequency of circling of electron νn (principle of accordance). However, one can show, that
there is a simple connection between the quantum frequency of radiation ν and the frequencies
of circling of electron νn and νk. Indeed, the frequency of the circling of electron is equal to

The quantum frequency of radiation is determined with the formula

The expression (1) we will written following way

Then

Thus, we obtained the formula, which connects the quantum frequency of radiation ν with
the frequencies circling of electron in atom hydrogen. The product nνn makes the following
sense: there are n of de Broglie’s wave in the orbit n. Then nνn = ν′
n is the frequency of de
Broglie’s wave of electron, moving in orbit n. So formula (2) can be written in following way

It is possible, that formula (3) is also true for atoms with many electrons.

The ﬂuorescence spectra of a sub-micron atomic cesium vapor layer observ-

able under resonant excitation on D2 line have been studied in the presence of

an external magnetic ﬁeld. Substantial changes in amplitudes and frequency

positions of the individual (resolved) hyperﬁne transitions have been recorded

in moderate magnetic ﬁelds (up to

50 Gauss). These features are caused

by mixing of the hyperﬁne states of the upper level resulting from comparable

values of the hyperﬁne splitting of the 62P3/2 manifold and Larmor frequencies

of the magnetic sublevels. The results of simulation show a good agreement

with the experimental spectra. Possible application of the results for high

spatial resolution magnetometry is discussed. PACS number(s): ???

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that application of an external magnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes absorptive and

dispersive properties of an atomic system. As magnetic ﬁeld strength starts to increase from

zero value, the degeneracy of atomic states lifts, and magnetic sublevels diverge. The linear

shift of these sublevels takes place until the B- ﬁeld values for which the Zeeman splitting

becomes comparable to the hyperﬁne splitting of atomic levels. In this regime, the wave

functions of the hyperﬁne manifold begin to mix with each other. This mixing results in

dual consequences. First, the shift of magnetic sublevels is no more linear on B- ﬁeld (and

of diﬀerent behavior for diﬀerent individual sublevels). Second, probabilities of the optical

transitions between the magnetic sublevels of the lower and upper atomic states diﬀer from

unperturbed values [1]. For the ﬁrst excited levels of Rb and Cs, the atoms of particular

interest for spectroscopic studies, the linear Zeeman regime ceases at B < 100 Gauss. Thus,

crossing of magnetic sublevels for 52P3/2 manifold of 85Rb occurs at B

4 Gauss [2]. Since

≈

magnetic splitting in these conditions is incomparably smaller than Doppler broadening,

direct observation of hyperﬁne sublevels mixing eﬀects in absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra

for vapor media becomes rather complicated. That is why the studies were done either for

higher magnetic ﬁelds [1], or by non-direct methods like selective reﬂection spectroscopy

[3,4] at lower magnetic ﬁelds. Also the alignment to orientation conversion observation can

be used as a very sensitive tool to study level mixing due to diﬀerent perturbations (see [5,6]

and references therein) including atoms with hyperﬁne structure in a magnetic ﬁeld [2].

Development of extremely thin vapor cells (ETC) of a sub-micron thickness [7] has

opened new possibilities for high resolution spectroscopy of vapor (gaseous) media, allowing

one to directly record sub-Doppler lines in the ﬂuorescence and transmission spectra. In

particular, as is shown in [7], all the six hyperﬁne transitions of the Cs atomic D2 line are

completely resolved in the ﬂuorescence spectrum (Fig.1 shows hyperﬁne levels and transitions

relevant for this line). Moreover, it should be noted that the amplitude ratios for the

individual hyperﬁne transitions are practically independent of exciting radiation intensity.

2

The latter indicates that the optical depopulation pumping on the non-cycling transitions

Fg = 3, 4

Fe = 3, 4 doesn’t establish even at the laser intensities of IL ∼
for the sub-micron vapor column length. This property is of importance for quantitative

50 mW/cm2

→

spectroscopic and magneto-optical measurements.

Absorption and emission processes in the sub-micron-thick dilute vapor layer are strongly

aﬀected by anisotropic geometrical factor. For the atoms ﬂying with mean thermal velocity

normally to the window surface (that is ”Doppler-sensitive” direction), the wall-to-wall ﬂight

time is only

1 ns, i.e., much less than inverse natural width of the optical transition. Fast

∼

atoms simply do not have time to absorb, and especially to emit before getting de-excited

on the dielectric surface. As a result, the contribution of slow longitudinal velocity atoms

in the spectra becomes predominant, giving rise to Dicke-type sub-Doppler features. And

since the use of the ETC allows to substantially diminish the Doppler broadening of spectral

lines, the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on individual hyperﬁne components can be revealed

at weaker magnetic ﬁelds as compared with well-known experiments on upper-state level

mixing and crossing in Doppler-broadened gases. Hence, the gradual I

J decoupling as a

−

magnetic ﬁeld increases can be studied in detail.

Up to now, magnetic ﬁeld-induced eﬀects in thin cells of radiation wavelength-scale

thickness have been studied only theoretically [8]. In this study, peculiarities of Faraday

rotation and magnetic circular dichroism have been considered.

In present work, we have studied the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld on ﬂuorescence spectra

of a sub-micron Cs vapor layer. The choice of ﬂuorescence rather than absorption studies

was justiﬁed by better spectral resolution of the individual hyperﬁne lines [7].

Schematic drawing of the measurement conﬁguration is shown in Fig.2. The radiation

beam (

3 mm) of the λ = 852 nm, 20 MHz-linewidth single-frequency cw laser diode

was directed at normal incidence onto the ETC of

300 nm thickness with the side arm

containing cesium. The cell was placed in the 3 pairs of mutually perpendicular Helmholtz

coils providing possibility to cancel the ambient magnetic ﬁeld and to apply homogeneous

magnetic ﬁeld in arbitrary direction. The laser frequency was linearly scanned in the region

of ν3 or ν4 transitions of Cs atom (Fig.1). A Glan-Thomson prism was used to purify original

(linear) radiation polarization of the laser diode; to produce a circular polarization, a λ/4

plate was utilized. A photodiode followed by an operation ampliﬁer was placed at 90◦ to the

laser propagation direction to detect the ﬂuorescence signal emerging through one of two

side openings of the cell oven. The photodiode collected emission within

0.1 srad solid

∼

angle.

Intensity of the ﬂuorescence emission (with no spectral and polarization analysis) from

the vapor layer excited by linearly and circularly polarized radiation was recorded versus

the laser radiation frequency, for various directions and magnitudes of the external magnetic

ﬁeld. For the case of longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld (B//k), notations of right- and left-handed

circular (elementary) polarizations are σ+ and σ−, respectively. As one could expect, switch-

ing from σ+(σ−) to σ−(σ+) by adjusting the λ/4 plate keeping invariable direction of the

magnetic ﬁeld +B in this case was completely identical to switching magnetic ﬁeld from

+B to

B keeping invariable polarization helicity σ+(σ−). Indeed, the recorded signals in

−

these two cases were the same, and for technical convenience, the second option has been

exploited for the regular measurements. Over 80 experimental spectra have been recorded

with the B-ﬁeld strength ranged from 0 to 55 Gauss (the maximum ﬁeld produced by the

set of Helmholtz coils we have used), with the step of 11 Gauss. In fact, some inﬂuence of

the magnetic ﬁeld is clearly observable already at B

10 Gauss, but to avoid cumbersome

∼

graphical presentation, we will restrict ourselves by the limiting cases of B = 0 and B = 55

Gauss (in the latter case the eﬀect of the B-ﬁeld is the most visible).

Scatter circles in Figs.3-5 show the examples of the recorded ﬂuorescence spectra. The

orientations of the B-ﬁeld are: B = Bz (Fig.3), B = Bx (Fig.4), and B = By (Fig.5).

Figs.3-5,a represent the results for ν3 transitions (Fg = 3

Fe = 2, 3, 4), and Figs.3-5,b

show the results for ν4 transitions (Fg = 4

Fe = 3, 4, 5)1. In all the ﬁgures, the upper row

→

of graphs are B = 0 spectra, and the lower row graphs are B = 55 Gauss spectra. Notations

for every column indicate the applied laser radiation polarization and B-ﬁeld orientation.

In fact, the same B = 0 spectra with linear and circular laser radiation polarization are

presented in the upper rows of all these ﬁgures, and they are repeated just to stress the

modiﬁcations induced by a magnetic ﬁeld in every particular case (for visual comparison).

The vertical (intensity) scale is the same for all the graphs; the horizontal (frequency) scale is

200 MHz/div, the frequency rises rightwards. Saturated absorption signal from an auxiliary

1.5 cm-long Cs cell has been used as a frequency marker (reference). The temperature of the

side arm reservoir of the cell (the latter deﬁned the saturated vapor pressure) was kept at

Tr = 105 ◦C throughout the measurements. Corresponding number density of Cs atoms is
1013 cm−3, and the width of collisional (homogeneous) broadening of the spectral

NCs = 2

lines is

1.8 MHz, i.e. nearly 3 times smaller as compared with the natural line width. The

×

≈

Doppler (inhomogeneous) line width at this temperature regime is

440 MHz.

≈

In agreement with nearly linear intensity dependence of the ﬂuorescence reported in [7],

the shape of ﬂuorescence spectrum does not noticeably depend on laser radiation intensity,

at least in the range of IL = 1

50 mW/cm2. All the spectra presented in graphs were

−

recorded with IL = 40 mW/cm2. For IL < 1 mW/cm2, the ﬂuorescence signal is too weak

to be recorded. On the other hand, focussing of the laser beam is required to get higher

laser intensities IL > 50 mW/cm2, but in this case the interaction time (time of ﬂight)

changes simultaneously; focussing also decreases the number of atoms contributing to the

ﬂuorescence signal. The spectra remain invariable under reversal of direction of the laser

1These notations are valid for B = 0. As I

J decoupling starts to develop in the B-ﬁeld, the

levels that initially are not accessible due to dipole transiton selection rules, start to contribute

to optical transitions. Hence, it is more correct to write Fg = 3

Fe = 2, 3, 4, (5) for ν3 and

frequency scanning. Substantial diﬀerence in spectra for right-handed (σ+) and left-handed

(σ−) circular polarizations of the laser radiation is observed only for longitudinal direction

of the B-ﬁeld (B = Bz, Fig.3). For the case of transverse magnetic ﬁeld (Figs.4,5), the

helicity of light is of no relevance, and the corresponding spectra are identical. Moreover,

the spectra with circularly-polarized excitation for B = Bx (Fig.4) and B = By (Fig.5) are

practically identical. These observations are well understandable from symmetry reasons.

As we can see from Figs.3-5, the individual magnetic subtransitions mF g →

for the ν3 line and 24 magnetic transitions for the ν4 line for each of elementary polarizations:

π (linear, B//E), σ+ and σ− (circular, B//k), and up to 88 magnetic transitions for more

complex B-ﬁeld orientation cases. The results of experiment can be rather interpreted as

B-ﬁeld orientation- and magnitude-dependent frequency shift and variation of amplitude of

the Fg →

Fe hyperﬁne transitions.

We would like to draw special attention to the results depicted in 3, with dramatic dif-

ference between the ﬂuorescence spectra for the σ+ and σ− polarizations. This non-intuitive

behavior reﬂects magnetic circular dichroism of the Cs atoms (i.e., diﬀerent absorption co-

eﬃcients for σ+ and σ− light in the magnetic ﬁeld). The most surprising result is that the

Fg = 3

Fe = 4 (Fig.3a, σ− polarization) and Fg = 4

→

are found to be completely suppressed at rather low magnetic ﬁelds.

We will use the following model to simulate the spectra of the Cs atomic ﬁlm without

a magnetic ﬁeld and in the magnetic ﬁeld. First, we will assume that the absorption rate

Γp is small in comparison with the relaxation rates in ground and excited states, denoted

by γ and Γ respectively: Γp < γ, Γ. This assumption is well justiﬁed by the observation

of ﬂuorescence spectrum independence of the laser intensity. Second, as far as laser line is

than the homogeneous width of the atomic transition. The radiation width of the transition

20 MHz, the laser radiation spectral line that excites atoms is broader

is Γrad = 1/(2πτ )

5.2 MHz, where τ

30.5 ns is lifetime of Cs in 62P3/2 state [9].

≈

≈

As we will see further, the conditions for laser excitation of atoms diﬀer substantially

when magnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ and when it is applied. Let us start with the analysis of

excitation of atoms in zero magnetic ﬁeld.

A. Zero magnetic ﬁeld signal

A convenient way to describe excited state atom optical excitation in the broad line

approximation is by means of a quantum density matrix fmm′ [10]. We will consider an

atom that absorbs laser light polarized in the direction characterized by light electric ﬁeld

vector Eexc.

In the limit of weak absorption, light does not aﬀect atoms in the ground

state. All the ground state magnetic sublevels remain equally populated, and no coherences

between magnetic sublevels in the ground state are created. In this situation the density

matrix of the excited state can be calculated as [11]:

Transition takes place from the ground state hyperﬁne level Fg to the excited state hyperﬁne

level Fe. Magnetic quantum numbers of the ground state hyperﬁne level Fg are denoted by µ
and magnetic quantum numbers of the excited state hyperﬁne level Fe by m and m′. Matrix

where Jg and Je denote total electronic angular momentum of an atom in the ground and

scheme allows to write the angular part of wave functions of atom in the following form:

and taking into account that optical transition dipole moment operator acts only upon the

electronic angular momentum and does not act upon the nuclear spin angular momentum,

we will get the following expression for the remaining reduced matrix element [13,14]:

matrix for diﬀerent ground and excited state hyperﬁne levels, rather easy.

Finally, the ﬂuorescence signal for each allowed hyperﬁne transition from the excited

state hyperﬁne level Fe to the ﬁnal hyperﬁne level Fg (which may or may not coincide with

the level from which absorption took place) can be calculated according to [10]:

where Eobs denotes the polarization of the light to which detector is sensitive. In the case

of ﬂuorescence, the general approach to calculation of dipole transition matrix elements

entering Eq.(7) is the same as above described method to calculate matrix elements en-

tering expression Eq.(1) for excited state density matrix calculation.

If we measure the

total intensity of ﬂuorescence, on transitions to both ground state hyperﬁne levels with-

out discrimination for a speciﬁc light polarization, than we simply must take a sum of two

ﬂuorescence components with orthogonal polarizations observed in a deﬁnite direction and

sum of two spectral transitions to the both ground state hyperﬁne levels with Fg = 3 and

Fg = 4. Such a spectrum simulated for linearly and circularly polarized excitation is given

on Fig.6a,b. Left and right graphs of the upper rows refer to the absorption of linearly and

circularly polarized light, respectively, from the ground state hyperﬁne level Fg = 4 (case

a) and Fg = 3 (case b). The dashed line represents the sum of three Lorentz type curves

centered around the respected hyperﬁne component frequency. Width of this Lorentz type

spectral line is chosen to be equal to 55 MHz. This is a width which gives signals that ﬁt

well to experimentally observed ones. For the experimental signal detected in this work,

this width includes laser linewidth, absorption linewidth formed by homogeneous linewidth

(natural and collisional), and residual Doppler broadening. Of course, when we have a ho-

mogeneous linewidth combined with inhomogeneous broadening, the resulting line shape

should be a Voigt contour, but just to make model as simple as one could, Lorentz type line

shape for each individual peak was chosen to produce Fig.6. This assumes that remaining

Doppler broadening is smaller than the homogeneous linewidth. One can see that the rel-

ative intensities of spectral components in this simulation diﬀer from relative line strength

which can be calculated as [15]

where Lg and Le are electron orbital momenta for the ground and excited state.

This diﬀerence has an obvious explanation. As far as we are using polarized light to excite

atoms, the excited state spatial angular momenta distribution of atoms is anisotropic. This

anisotropy is diﬀerent for diﬀerent types of transitions and depends on quantum numbers Fg

and Fe. It is especially sensitive to the quantity ∆F = Fg−
from the excited state hyperﬁne levels towards a speciﬁc direction in a space diﬀers, among

Fe. As a result, radiation emission

other factors like transition strength, also because of this anisotropy. For more detailed

explanation of this eﬀect, see for example [16,17].

B. Signal with a magnetic ﬁeld

magnetic ﬁeld can be written as

action. The remaining two terms represent interaction of the electronic magnetic moment

µJ of atom and the nucleus magnetic moment µI with the external magnetic ﬁeld B. These

magnetic moments are connected with the respective electronic and spin angular moments

J and I of the atom:

where µB and µ0 are the Bohr and nuclear magnetons respectively, and gJ , gI are electrotonic

and nuclear Land´e factors. The action of magnetic ﬁeld on the atom has two closely related

eﬀects. First, magnetic sublevels of the hyperﬁne levels are mixed in the magnetic ﬁeld:

where C (e)

kFe(B, m) and C (i)

jFi(B, µ) are mixing coeﬃcients depending on the ﬁeld strength and

magnetic quantum number (m or µ). The second eﬀect is deviation of the Zeeman magnetic

10

sublevel splitting in the magnetic ﬁeld for each hyperﬁne level form the linear one. It means

that the additional energy of the magnetic sublevel obtained in the magnetic ﬁeld is not any

more linearly proportional to the ﬁeld strength. In general case, new atomic states

in the magnetic ﬁeld are linear combinations of all initial hyperﬁne levels (4 in

and

|

the case of Cs atoms in 62P3/2 state and 2 in case of Cs atom in the 62S1/2 state). As it

is seen from Eq.(11), the hyperﬁne angular momentum quantum number F ceases to be a

good quantum number in the magnetic ﬁeld, but magnetic quantum numbers m and µ are

still good quantum numbers. This reﬂects the symmetry of the perturbation imposed by the

magnetic ﬁeld and means that only hyperﬁne sublevels with the same magnetic quantum

numbers are mixed by the magnetic ﬁeld.

The mixing coeﬃcients C (e)

kFe(B, m) and C (i)

jFi(B, µ) of the hyperﬁne states in the magnetic

ﬁeld and energies of these levels γk Em, ηj Eµ can be found as eigenvectors and eigenvalues

of the Hamilton matrix (9). In Fig.7, the energy levels obtained by the Hamilton matrix

diagonalization for Cs atom in the excited 62P3/2 state in the magnetic ﬁeld are presented.

For Cs atoms in the ground state hyperﬁne level, the splitting exceeds 9 GHz, which is

large in comparison to the magnetic sublevel energies obtained in the magnetic ﬁeld. As a

result, ground state energy levels in the magnetic ﬁeld can with very good approximation

be represented by the linear Zeeman eﬀect. Namely ηj Eµ = gηj µBBµ/¯h, where gηj is the

Land´e factor of the respective hyperﬁne level. For very weakly mixed levels they still can be

represented with the hyperﬁne quantum number Fg. For Cs atoms in 62S1/2 state we have

gηj =

1/4 for Fg = 3, and gηj = 1/4 for Fg = 4. In the case of mixing of only two hyperﬁne

−

levels, an analytical formula can be derived for mixing coeﬃcients and for level energies in

the magnetic ﬁeld, similar to Breit Rabi formula, see for example [18].

The excited state density matrix created by the laser light in the magnetic ﬁeld can be

written as (see for example [2])

kl∆ωmm′ = (γk Em −

11

belonging to the excited state levels k and l. Magnetic quantum numbers of the ground

state level ηj are denoted by µ and magnetic quantum numbers of the excited state level
γk,l by m and m′. In this last expression it is assumed that two magnetic sublevels of the

excited state, that initially belonged to two diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels, can have the same

energy and can be excited simultaneously and coherently at some speciﬁc magnetic ﬁeld

strength. This means that nonzero ﬁeld level crossing signals [2] are included in this model.

At the same time, for practical calculations performed in this work this is of no relevance,

since no nonzero magnetic ﬁeld level crossings take place at the values B

55 Gauss used

≤

in the experiment.

In our particular simulation, we assume that when we scan the laser frequency in the

manifold of splitted in the external magnetic ﬁeld magnetic sublevels, only those transitions

that are in an exact resonance with the laser ﬁeld are excited. So at each radiation frequency,

a speciﬁc for this frequency density matrix is calculated. Of course, density matrix is depen-

dent also on the magnetic ﬁeld strength, which determines magnetic sublevel splitting and

wave function mixing and as a result, transition probabilities between magnetic sublevels.

In general case, the intensity of the ﬂuorescence with a speciﬁc polarization Eobs in a

transition between excited γk and ﬁnal ηj state in the magnetic ﬁeld can be calculated

according to [2]:

Final state of the transition may or may not coincide with the atomic ground state from

which the absorption started. In lower row graphs of Fig.6a,b, the ﬂuorescence spectra (line

positions and relative intensities) are shown as vertical bars, for the case of excitation from

Fg = 4 (a) and Fg = 3 (b), with linear and circular light polarizations. The dashed lines again

show the resulting spectra supposing that each component has a Lorentz shape line with 55

MHz width. The results for B = 55 Gauss in Fig.6 represent graphical illustration of the

calculation approach for the case of elementary polarizations (π, B = Bx, and σ+, B = Bz).

For other geometrical conﬁgurations, the situation is more complex to be presented by

12

vertical bars, since two or even three elementary polarization components may be involved.

This approach to calculate spectra in the magnetic ﬁeld and in the absence of the ﬁeld

was used in the simulation of experimentally observed signals. The simulation was done

for all the experimentally recorded spectra shown in Figs.3-5, the results are presented by

solid lines. One can see rather good agreement between the theoretical and experimental re-

sults. Some discrepancy observable in the graphs may be attributed to the following factors.

First, the simulation model implies Lorentz proﬁle, rather than Voigt one, for individual

transitions, and this simpliﬁcation may introduce some spectral distortions. Second, the cell

geometry (narrow gap between the thick windows) imposes additional (polarization sensi-

tive) asymmetry on the spatial distribution of the emission. The ﬂuorescence emitted under

noticeable range of angles around 90◦ may be guided towards the photodiode by [multi-

ple] grazing reﬂections from the external/internal faces of the window. Third, the recorded

spectra may be aﬀected by anisotropic elastic collisions of polarized atoms with the cell

walls.

IV. CONCLUSION

The resonance ﬂuorescence of Cs vapor layer of sub-micron thickness has been studied in

the presence of moderate (

50 Gauss) external magnetic ﬁeld, under excitation of atoms by

∼

the laser radiation tuned to the frequency region of D2 line. The spectra recorded for vari-

ous reciprocal orientations of magnetic ﬁeld and laser polarization (linear, circular) exhibit

substantial frequency shift, modiﬁcation of peak amplitude and line shape for individual

hyperﬁne transitions. These changes originate from mixing of the hyperﬁne levels of the

upper state 62P3/2 and become observable because of intrinsic sub-Doppler nature of atomic

signal in an extremely thin cell. The simulation has been performed by means of a quan-

tum density matrix in the broad line approximation for a weak absorption regime, taking

into account mixing of magnetic sublevels of the hyperﬁne levels and their non-linear shift

in magnetic ﬁeld. The results of simulation show good agreement with the experimental

results, which indicates that other possible eﬀects (anisotropy in long-range atom-surface

interaction, coherent and propagation eﬀects, etc.) have no practical contribution in the

conditions of our study.

Zeeman splitting of hyperﬁne sublevels in vapor media for moderate magnetic ﬁeld has

been observed in selective reﬂection [4] and saturated absorption [19] spectroscopy. Never-

theless, direct recording of ﬂuorescence (and possibly absorption) spectra using extremely

thin cells is a more straightforward method, since the signal in this case is not inﬂuenced by

contribution from other unavoidable processes (dispersion and non-linear eﬀects, crossover

resonances, etc.). Sub-Doppler resolution that is a necessary condition for observation of

Zeeman splitting is satisﬁed also for atomic beams, as well as for cold atoms. In these cases,

however, cumbersome optical setups are required. Moreover, application of a magnetic ﬁeld

may perturb initial properties of atomic system (the case of cold atoms in magneto-optical

traps).

The results of present work can be used for high spatial resolution magnetometry. Indeed,

the interaction of laser radiation with atomic system responsible for magnetic sensitivity

takes place in the sub-micron gap between the cell windows. Note that also the transverse

dimensions of the interaction region can be essentially reduced (to the micrometer range)

by means of focussing the laser beam. Extremely small sensor size of corresponding mag-

netometer device may allow the ﬁne mapping of magnetic ﬁeld spatial distribution that can

be important for many applications, in particular for testing high-gradient magnetic ﬁelds.

The magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity can be noticeably enhanced by use of Rb D2 line where the

smaller splitting of the upper state (52P3/2) will cause recordable level mixing eﬀects at

much lower B- ﬁelds (

1 Gauss). It should be noted that though suggested device will

∼

have much lower sensitivity than other optical magnetometer schemes (in particular, ones

based on nonlinear Faraday and Hanle eﬀects), there are several advantages that justify its

possible application, namely: i) unique spatial resolution, ii) simplicity of optical setup, iii)

extended upper limit of measured B- ﬁelds.

magnetic ﬁeld, analytically and numerically with a judiciously chosen basis.

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of atoms and molecules in a magnetic ﬁeld is both a classic example of time-independent perturbation
theory and a vexing challenge in the study of neutron stars and white dwarfs. A suﬃciently intense magnetic
ﬁeld cannot be treated perturbatively. The spectra and properties of neutron-star atmospheres depend crucially on
magnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, in the intense magnetic ﬁeld of a neutron star B >
1010 G the nucleus rather than the ﬁeld

acts as a perturbation. The electron is eﬀectively conﬁned to move along the magnetic ﬁeld lines.

This work extends classic analytic work on the one-dimensional hydrogen atom [1,2] to form the basis of a perturba-

tive treatment of hydrogen in an intense magnetic ﬁeld. This analytic treatment yields binding energies for B >
∼
G whose accuracy rivals that of the recent exhaustive treatment of hydrogen in an magnetic ﬁeld by Ruder et al.
with substantially less computational expense.

We also present a straightforward numerical treatment of the hydrogen atom, the hydrogen molecular ion and the
helium atom. The electron wavefunction is expanded in a convenient basis, and the Schr¨odinger equation may be
solved approximately by diagonalizing a suitably calculated matrix. The eﬀective potential between the electrons and
between the electrons and the nuclei may be determined analytically, expediting the calculation dramatically.

II. THE SINGLE ELECTRON PROBLEM

We begin with the problem of a single electron bound by the combined ﬁeld of an atomic nucleus and strong external

magnetic ﬁeld. The Hamiltonian for the electron is given by

where 1 denotes the spin and spatial coordinates of the electron i.e. r1, σ1. The spin portion of the wavefunction
decouples from the spatial component; therefore, we take the electron spins antialigned with the magnetic ﬁeld to
minimize the total energy, i.e. to calculate the ground state.

For Z = 0, we recover the equation for a free electron in an external magnetic ﬁeld which is satisﬁed by a function

of the form

We will express ﬁeld strengths in terms of β = B/BI.

For Z

= 0, the complete solution may be expanded in a sum of ψnmpz since these form a complete set. However,
for suﬃciently strong ﬁelds, one can treat the Coulomb potential as a perturbation and use the ground Landau state
with the appropriate m quantum number as the ﬁrst approximation to the radial wavefunction; this is known as the
adiabatic approximation.

Equivalently, the adiabatic approximation assumes that the Coulomb potential does not eﬀectively mix the Landau

As we see from Fig. 1, the relative diﬀerence between the two expressions is largest near z = kmaH . For m = 0,

We obtain the following eigenvalue equation with the approximated potential,

tend to inﬁnity as ξ goes to inﬁnity.

As with the equation for an unmagnetized Coulomb potential, there exists an additional set of solutions. For the
three-dimensional Coulomb problem, this solution diverges at the origin and is unphysical. However, here we can
obtain a well behaved solution. By the method of reduction of order, we obtain the alternative solutions,

These solutions agree with earlier treatments of the one-dimensional hydrogen atom [1,2]. For integer values of nZ,
the integral in Eq. 23 diverges; therefore, the eigenvalues diﬀer from those of the unmagnetized Coulomb potential.
Additionally for the unmagnetized Coulomb potential, ξm = 0 and the prefactor of (

in this case, this wavefunction diverges as ξ−1 near the origin and only the counterparts of the states given by Eq. 22

The solutions to Eq. 17 will be made of a linear combination of Z1 and Z2. For a given magnetic quantum number
m, the excitations along the magnetic ﬁeld axis will be denoted by ν with ν = 0 being the ground state. Determining
the ground eigenvalue of Eq. 21 for a given value of ξm proceeds in reverse. Since the ground state is even, we have
A+ = A− and Z ′(0) = 0. One ﬁrst selects a value for 0 < nZ < 1. To have the correct behavior as z

15.58 Ry. We ﬁnd ξ0 = 0.141 which yields β = 1000. For β = 1000, Ruder et al.
[3] obtain a binding energy for the
m = 0, ν = 0 state of 18.60986 Ry. However, it is straightforward to improve upon our estimate of the binding energy
by treating the small diﬀerence between the approximate and eﬀective potential as a perturbation. We obtain

This technique may also be applied to states with m < 0 by using the appropriate value for km in Eq. 17. For

a better approximation to the eﬀective potential for electrons in the m = 0 state than in m > 0 states we obtain
eigenvalues to ﬁrst order within 0.7 % of the fully numerical treatment for β
1000 for these states (compared to
within 1.4 % for m =

1 states).

To calculate the wavefunctions with ν > 0, we calculate Z2(ξ) for nZ > 1 and use the ﬁrst extremum or zero of
Z2(ξ) as the value of ξ0 for the even and odd solutions respectively. Fig. 2 depicts Z2(ξ) for several values of nZ.
For nZ between k and k + 1, Z2(x) has k zeros and k + 1 extrema. Therefore, we ﬁnd that the ν > 0 states have
zeroth-order binding energies of fractions of a Rydberg. The calculation of Z2(ξ) is complicated by the fact that the
function Z1(ξ) also has zeros in the range of integration from ξ to
which make Eq. 23 ill deﬁned. To pass over the
singularities in the integrand, we integrate the diﬀerential equation 21 directly.

−

For smaller values of nZ in the range k to k + 1, the ﬁrst zeros and extrema approach ξ = 0. Therefore, for larger
values of β, the zeroth order eigenvalues of the ν > 0 spectrum approach the Bohr energies. The energies of the odd
states approach the Bohr energies from below (i.e. they are more weakly bound), and the even states with the same
number of nodes are yet more weakly bound [2].

000
Our ﬁrst-order adiabatic approximation is less accurate for smaller ﬁeld strengths. For β = 100 and m = 0 (

i
we obtain a ﬁrst-order corrected eigenvalue of 9.348 Ry compared to the numerically derived value of 9.4531 Ry (a
1011 G, the wavefunctions and binding energies derived in this

To obtain ﬁrst order corrections to the wavefunctions Zmν and second order corrections to the binding energies,
we follow the standard techniques for time-independent perturbation theory [8]. We must calculate the following
quantities

for a particular value of β. Since both Veﬀ and Vapprox are symmetric about z = 0, H ′

νµ is zero for ν odd and µ even.

We obtain

and

For β = 1000, the mixing among the ν states is on the order of a few percent. The second order corrections to the
binding energies for the ground (ν = 0) state is 10−3 times the ﬁrst order correction. For the excited states with ν < 6
the second order correction is less than six percent of the ﬁrst-order correction; we quote the binding energies to ﬁrst
order for the several of the most bound levels of hydrogen for β
1000 in Table I and depict the wavefunctions to
zeroth order for β = 1000 in Fig. 3.

which is a function of aZ and the azimuthal state given by m. We calculate this matrix for k, l < N (N = 5
50) and
diagonalize it. The eigenvalues of this matrix (λν ) are Eνm, and the eigenvectors are the coeﬃcients Aνmk in Eq. 29.
Additionally, the functions Zνm(z) and
Gk(z) have deﬁnite parity; consequently, for even parity solutions to Eq. 12,
only the elements of Mkl with k and l even need to be calculated. This reduces the size of the matrix from N 2 to
N 2/4.

Because the number of basis functions used is not inﬁnite, we cannot expect the expansion to span the Hilbert space
of solutions to Eq. 12. To estimate the solution, we vary aZ to minimize the eigenvalue λν corresponding to the bound
state that we are interested in. By using an expansion of the form Eq. 29, the binding energies and wavefunctions
may be estimated for excited states along the z-axis.

Obtaining an additional few parts per thousand in accuracy can only justify a portion of the additional computation
required for this numerical technique; however, this technique may be applied to solve the Schr¨odinger equation for
potentials more complicated than Eq. 14.

Before proceeding to the multi-electron problem, we study the binding energy of the H+

2 molecule in an intense
magnetic ﬁeld. We restrict our attention to the case where the axis of the molecule is aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld

V. THE MULTIPLE ELECTRON PROBLEM

A. Approach and Results

To calculate the atomic structure of multi-electron atoms, we employ a single-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock technique.
Speciﬁcally, we assume that the multi-electron wavefunction is given by a single Slater determinant of one-electron
wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are varied to minimize the total energy of the system given the constraint that
each one-electron wavefunction remains normalized.

This minimization results in the following eigenvalue equations for the individual wavefunctions,

where 1 denotes the spin and spatial coordinates of the electron i.e. r1, σ1.
The operator F (1) is the sum of a kinetic and potential energy term

(33)

(34)

where the kinetic term is given by the one-particle Schr¨odinger equation of an electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the
nucleus.

Rather than solve the eigenvalue equations directly, we calculate the total energy of the system given a set of wave-
functions and minimize this energy by varying the parameters of the wavefunctions.

In a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld, these equations for the atomic structure become approximately separable in

cylindrical coordinates. With this in mind, we take the trial wavefunctions to be of the form

Since we are looking for the ground state of these atoms, we take all the electron spins antialigned with the ﬁeld and
the radial wavefunction to be given by n = 0 Landau states with each electron occupying a diﬀerent m state. We
obtain

ψi(1) = Z(z)R(ρ, φ)χ(σ).

After the integration over the radial and angular coordinates, the energy may now be written as expectation values
of operators acting on the Z(z) wavefunction. Since each electron is assumed to be in a particular Landau m level,
we can calculate an eﬀective potential energy between the electron and the nucleus by integrating over ρ, φ. The
potential is given by Eq. 13.

The calculational strategy is similar to the single electron case. The quantum numbers ν, m for each electron are
chosen ahead of time, and the wavefunction Z(z) is expanded as Eq. 29 with each electron having is own variable
value of aZ. For each electron i, the matrix

(Mi)kl =

hGk|

F (i)

(61)

is calculated.

The added complication is that the diagonalization of the matrices Mi must proceed iteratively. For the given
values of aZ, the matrices are ﬁrst calculated assuming that the other electrons (j
= i) have Ak = 1 for k = νj. Then
each electron’s matrix is diagonalized and the νith eigenvector is used to calculate the interelectron potential for the
next iteration. The matrices converge after
10 iterations. Next, the values of aZ for each electron are varied to

minimize the total energy of the conﬁguration.

For brevity, we discuss the ground state energies and wavefunctions for H2, He and HHe as a function of ﬁeld
strength for β
1000. For the molecules we again take the molecular axis to be aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld
direction. Since we are interested in the ground states of these species we set ν = 0 for all the electrons and assign the
electrons consecutive m quantum numbers beginning with m = 0. Because none of the electrons have axial excitations,
we are interested in only the most negative eigenvalue of the electron matrices. This eigenvalue is more eﬃciently
determined by varying the coeﬃcients in Eq. 29 directly than by diagonalizing the electron matrices iteratively.

Table IV gives the binding energies of the most tightly bound states of H2, He, HHe and H calculated numerically
using the variational method. The energies for H are within 1.1 % of the values quoted by Ruder et al. [3] for weakest
ﬁeld strength common between the two studies. For the stronger ﬁelds, the agreement is even closer. For He the
energies are within 2.5 % of the values of Ruder et al. for the ﬁelds that overlap.

We also computed the binding energies of H2 and H− and compared the results with the values found by Lai et al.

B. Validity of the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

When studying molecules in a intense magnetic ﬁeld, we have assumed that the nuclear motion and the electronic
motion decouple, i.e. the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Schmelcher et al. [12] have examined the validity of
this approximation in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. They performed a pseudoseparation of the equations
of motion and derive electronic and nuclear equations of motion. Because we have assumed throughout that the
nuclei are inﬁnitely massive and that the molecules are aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld, the corrections to the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation may be neglected. However, the techniques outlined here, speciﬁcally the use of one-
dimensional Coulomb wavefunctions and Gauss-Hermite functions as a convenient and compact basis for the electronic
wavefunctions of atoms and molecules in intense magnetic ﬁelds, can be extended to the more general case where
these restrictions have been relaxed.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed both an analytic and a convenient numerical technique to accurately calculate the properties
of simple atoms and molecules in an intense magnetic ﬁeld. The calculations presented here complement the earlier
work. We examine two compounds (HHe and HHe+) in addition to the species studied earlier which may form in the
intensely magnetized outer layers of a neutron star. Additionally, our technique ﬁnds both tightly bound and excited
states eﬃciently and accurately which is necessary to calculate the radiative transfer of the neutron star atmosphere.
The techniques presented in this paper complement the recent work in this area. They provide moderately high
precision with little computational or algebraic expense. Most recent work has focussed on extremely high precision by
using a Hartree-Fock-like method to reduce the three-dimensional problem to three coupled one-dimensional problems.
Generally, two of the one-dimensional equations are solved over an functional basis, i.e. Legendre polynomials [13] or
spherical harmonics [14], and the radial diﬀerential equation is solved numerically over a pointlike basis. Fassbinder
et al.

[15] and Shertzer et al. [16,17] use a ﬁnite element method throughout.

The spirit of the work presented here is diﬀerent. We have solved for the wavefunctions using a basis for all
three coordinates: the Landau wavefunctions in the angular and radial direction and the one-dimensional Coulomb
wavefunctions or the Gauss-Hermite functions along the axis of the magnetic ﬁeld. The power of this technique is
that the basis functions resemble the actual wavefunctions and preserve the symmetries of the potential; consequently
only a few basis functions (

20 respectively) are require to reach moderately high precision.

2 and

1

The work of Kravchenko et al. [18,19] takes an orthogonal approach and achieves very high precision by solving the
general problem of a hydrogen atom in an arbitrarily strong magnetic ﬁeld with a double power series in sin θ and r.
It remains to be seen whether this simple and accurate technique can be applied to more general problems.

The properties of the lowest density layers of a neutron star’s crust determine the spectral characteristics of the
radiation expected from the star. One possibility is that linear chains of atoms form in the surface layers [20–24,6],
and the atmosphere condenses at ﬁnite density. We ﬁnd that the reactions between hydrogen and helium are unlikely
to aﬀect the formation of hydrogen or helium chains unless the formation of hydrogen-helium hybrid chains is favored.
If the envelope is truncated at suﬃciently high density, the thermal isolation of the core can be substantially
reduced [25]. Furthermore, the composition of the outermost layers determines the spectra from the neutron star
(e.g. [26–29]). Without understanding magnetized chemistry in neutron-star atmospheres, is diﬃcult to interpret
observations of these objects.

FIG. 1. The relative diﬀerence between the eﬀective potential and the approximated potential. The solid line traces the

diﬀerence for the m = 0 state and the dotted line gives the m = −1 state.

FIG. 2. The function Z2(ξ) for ξ0 = 0 for nZ = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2.

FIG. 3. The axial wavefunctions of hydrogen in an intense magnetic ﬁeld (analytic calculation) for β = 1000. The left panel
depicts the ﬁrst four even states with axial excitations (|000i, |002i, |004i, |006i). The right panel shows the ﬁrst two odd states
(|001i, |003i).

FIG. 4. A comparison of numerical and analytic wavefunctions for hydrogen. Both panels are for β = 1000. The left panel
displays the state |000i, and the right shows |001i. The dashed line traces the numerical results with the ﬁrst 31 Gk. The solid
line traces the zeroth-order analytic solutions.

FIG. 5. The ground and ﬁrst-excited state of H+

2 . The solid line traces |000i, and the dashed line follows |0 − 10i. The

triangles give the positions of the protons for the ground state and the squares for the excited state.

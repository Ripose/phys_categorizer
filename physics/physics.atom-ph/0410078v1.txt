Abstract. Quasi-static models of barrier suppression have played a major role
in our understanding of the ionization of atoms and molecules in strong laser
in the case of diatomic molecules these studies
ﬁelds. Despite their success,
have so far been restricted to ﬁelds aligned with the molecular axis.
In this
paper we investigate the locations and heights of the potential barriers in the
hydrogen molecular ion in an electric ﬁeld of arbitrary orientation. We ﬁnd that
the barriers undergo bifurcations as the external ﬁeld strength and direction are
varied. This phenomenon represents an unexpected level of intricacy even on this
most elementary level of the dynamics. We describe the dynamics of tunnelling
ionization through the barriers semiclassically and use our results to shed new
light on the success of a recent theory of molecular tunnelling ionization as well
as earlier theories that restrict the electric ﬁeld to be aligned with the molecular

1. Introduction

The description of the electronic dynamics in the hydrogen molecular ion was one of
the important issues in the early days of quantum mechanics and was fundamental
to the development of quantum chemistry [1, 2]. Recent progress in diﬀerent ﬁelds
of physics has thrust this seemingly museumish, if venerable problem back into the
focus of current research: the study of the nonlinear, nonperturbative interaction of
matter with intense, ultrashort pulses [3–5] and of the fascinating internal dynamics of
Rydberg plasmas [6–9]. Both demand the investigation of the electron motion under
the inﬂuence of two stationary Coulomb centres (TCC) and an external static electric
ﬁeld: On the one hand, quasistatic models of laser-matter interaction that neglect the
time-dependence of the laser ﬁeld have here been surprisingly successful [5,10–12]. On
the other hand, in a cold plasma the background ions are almost stationary, so that
their Coulomb ﬁelds are static to a good approximation [13].

In the present paper, we initiate an investigation of the classical and semiclassical
mechanics of the electron motion under the inﬂuence of two Coulomb centres and an

Semiclassical ionization dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion

external ﬁeld of arbitrary orientation. We focus on a description of the saddle points of
the relevant potential because they regulate the ionization of the molecule [14]. The
locations and heights of the saddles depend on the orientation of the external ﬁeld
and on its strength. Apart from this expected smooth change, we ﬁnd bifurcation
points where additional potential saddles are created or collide and are destroyed. The
occurrence of bifurcations even on this most elementary level of the dynamics indicates
that the full dynamics must be much more intricate than appears at ﬁrst sight. The
heights of the potential saddles determine the possibility or impossibility of classical
over-the-barrier ionization. They depend strongly on the direction of the ﬁeld. After
a detailed discussion of the onset of over-the-barrier ionization, we turn the dynamics
of tunnelling ionization, which has recently been the subject of intense study [15–17].
Using methods of modern nonlinear dynamics, we propose a dynamical mechanism
that underlies the success of recent theory of molecular tunnelling ionization [17] that
is fashioned after the well-known Ammosov-Delone-Kra˘ınov (ADK) theory [18]. The
techniques we apply are based on classical mechanics that obeys scaling laws (see
section 2). For this reason, although we focus our exposition on the laser ionization
of molecules, the results are equally valid for the much larger internuclear distances
relevant to the physics of Rydberg plasmas. At the same time, our methods generalize
straightforwardly to more complicated systems, such as the electronic motion under
the inﬂuence of more than two Coulomb centres, possibly in the presence of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds.

In contrast to atoms, which are spherically symmetric in the absence of external
ﬁelds, a diatomic molecule possesses a preferred molecular axis. The reaction of the
molecule to an electric ﬁeld will depend not only on the ﬁeld strength, but also on its
direction. In addition, an atom in an external ﬁeld retains rotational symmetry around
the ﬁeld axis, which renders the electronic dynamics eﬀectively two-dimensional. In
a molecule any external ﬁeld that is not aligned with the molecular axis breaks all
continuous symmetries, leads to a strong coupling of all three degrees of freedom
and thus induces a signiﬁcantly more complicated dynamics. Because it has been
shown both experimentally [19, 20] and theoretically [21, 22] that a diatomic molecule
in a strong laser ﬁeld experiences a torque that tends to align its axis with that
of the electric ﬁeld, and also because it avoids the intricacies due to the inclusion
of an additional degree of freedom, investigations of the quasistatic dynamics have
mainly been restricted to the two-dimensional case of parallel axes [23–28]. In many
cases, the ionization of the molecule was even described in terms of a one-dimensional
model [23–25]. However, ﬁrst investigations of the misaligned case [29] show that its
dynamics is remarkably diﬀerent from the case of aligned axes.

Classical and semiclassical methods such as the ﬁeld ionization–Coulomb
explosion (FICE) model
[23–25] have served well to illuminate the dynamics of
molecular ionization in a static ﬁeld. Their virtue is that they can provide an intuitive
picture of the essential dynamics, even in situations where many coupled degrees of
freedom are involved and that are intractable by exact quantum mechanical methods.
For this reason it is highly desirable to make their power available to the description of
the general case which, due to the complete breaking of symmetries, can be expected
In this paper, we will embark on a description of the

electronic dynamics in the ﬁeld of two stationary Coulomb centres (TCC) together
with a static electric ﬁeld of arbitrary strength and arbitrary orientation. Given the
success of the FICE model [23–25] for the collinear conﬁguration of non-hydrogenic
and even heteronuclear molecules, we expect our results to be valuable beyond the

Semiclassical ionization dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion

hydrogen molecular ion for a wide range of more complicated molecules.

We will focus on the description of the saddle points of the TCC system in an
electric ﬁeld, i.e. the unstable equilibrium points where the electron can be at rest.
They are the critical bottlenecks where ionization takes place.
It has been shown
recently [14] that, using the methods of modern nonlinear dynamics, one can compute
ionization rates of atoms in external ﬁelds from a detailed description of the saddle
points. Therefore, after laying out some general properties of the TCC potential in
an external ﬁeld in section 2, we will, in section 3, start our investigation with the
identiﬁcation of the saddle points the potential possesses. Already in this seemingly
elementary ﬁrst step, we will encounter the richness the dynamics of our system
exhibits: We will ﬁnd that the potential saddles undergo bifurcations as the ﬁeld
strength and ﬁeld direction are varied, so that for any given external ﬁeld either two
or four saddle points can coexist. We will also see that the saddles diﬀer in their
indicess, i.e. in the number of unstable directions attached to them.

The most fundamental property of a saddle point is its height. The height
determines if classical over-the-barrier ionization can take place (namely, when the
saddle is lower than the electron energy) or is forbidden. It therefore marks the onset
of ionization. We will discuss the heights of the diﬀerent saddles as function of ﬁeld
strength, ﬁeld direction and internuclear distance in section 4.

If the energy of a bound electron is lower than the classical ionization threshold,
the molecule can still ionize by means of tunnelling [10, 30, 31]. This process is
[18], which uses the ionization rate of
commonly described by the ADK model
a hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ion in a static external ﬁeld.
In that system,
ionization takes place predominantly along the axis of the external electric ﬁeld, so
that the description of the ionization process reduces to a one-dimensional tunnelling
calculation. The ADK model has recently been generalized by Tong et al
[17] to
explain the tunnelling ionization of diatomic molecules. These authors explain the
ionization suppression found experimentally for a wide range of molecules by taking
into account the anisotropy of the bound-state molecular wave functions. They
neglect, however, the coupling of the diﬀerent degrees of freedom that is absent
in atomic ionization, but relevant in a molecule.
In section 5 we will analyze the
tunnelling dynamics for the hydrogen molecular ion in a misaligned electric ﬁeld from
the point of view of nonlinear dynamics and thereby elucidate the reason why the
approach of Tong et al could nevertheless succeed. Our approach will also clarify
the success of theories that assume the electric ﬁeld to be aligned with the molecular
axis [15, 23–27].

2. The TCC potential in an electric ﬁeld

In the following, we will discuss the dynamics of an electron under the combined
inﬂuence of two stationary nuclei of charge Z and a homogeneous static electric ﬁeld.
We will choose the coordinate system so that the external ﬁeld is in the xz-plane and
the nuclei are lying on the z-axis, at a distance c on both sides of the origin. With
these conventions, the electronic dynamics can be described by the Hamiltonian, in
atomic units,

Here, F is the strength of the external ﬁeld. The angle φ between the ﬁeld and the
negative z-axis uniquely speciﬁes the ﬁeld direction. Notice that we have taken V to
denote the potential energy of an electron with negative unit charge. It is the negative
of the electrostatic potential.

Apart from the external ﬁeld strength and direction, the potential (2) and the
Hamiltonian (1) depend on the nuclear charge Z and the internuclear distance 2c.
Those dependences can be removed by introducing the scaled quantities

˜x = x/c ,
˜F = c2F/Z ,
˜H = cH/Z ,

˜p = (c/Z)1/2p ,

˜V = cV /Z .

In terms of these scaled variables, the scaled Hamiltonian reads

The nuclear charges have been scaled to 1 and the internuclear distance to 2. It is
this scaled form of the dynamics that we will use in most of what follows, returning
to the unscaled variables as necessary.

Notice that the Hamiltonian (4) is symmetric with respect to a reﬂection in the
xz-plane, so that this plane is invariant under the dynamics. Furthermore, for φ = 90◦
the external ﬁeld is oriented along the x-axis and there is an additional symmetry with
respect to reﬂection in the xy-plane. In the general case, a reﬂection in that plane
takes an external ﬁeld oriented at an angle φ from the negative z-axis into a ﬁeld
oriented at an angle 180◦

φ, so that the dynamics in these two situations agree.

3. The potential saddles of the TCC system in an electric ﬁeld

In this section we will identify and describe the equilibrium points of the potential (5)
˜V = 0. Section 3.1 describes their locations. In a second step, in section 3.2,
where
we will compute the Hessian matrix of the potential in these points to classify them
as potential maxima, minima or saddles.

3.1. The location of equilibria

The task of ﬁnding the stationary points of the combined potential can be rephrased
as ﬁnding those points where the Coulomb ﬁeld caused by the two centres is equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction to the applied external ﬁeld. We will therefore,
in this section, restrict ourselves to a discussion of the pure TCC potential and locate
those points where the TCC electric ﬁeld has a given strength and direction. For
symmetry reasons it is obvious that these points can only lie in the xz-plane spanned
by the molecular axis and the direction of the external ﬁeld. We can therefore further
restrict our discussion to the TCC ﬁeld strength in that plane. Due to the sign

conventions taken in (2), the external ﬁeld makes an angle φ with the negative z-
axis and, if φ is chosen in the interval 0 < φ < 180◦, has a negative x component.
As a consequence, the TCC ﬁeld balancing the external ﬁeld must have a positive
x component and make and angle φ with the positive z-axis. This is the range of
parameters to which we will restrict our attention in the following.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the absolute value of the TCC ﬁeld strength, disregarding
the ﬁeld direction. The variation of ﬁeld strength in the xz-plane is illustrated in
ﬁgure 1(a). Regions of high ﬁeld strength are located in the vicinity of either nucleus.
There, the ﬁeld caused by the close-by nucleus is much stronger than that of the remote
nucleus, so that the lines of constant ﬁeld strength are nearly concentric circles around
the nucleus. At the other extreme, the ﬁeld strength is zero at the midpoint between
the nuclei, i.e. at x = z = 0, as well as inﬁnitely far from the centres. For suﬃciently
low ﬁeld strengths, therefore, there is a ﬁeld strength line surrounding the midpoint
and a second strength line surrounding both centres.

Thus, although the topology of ﬁeld strength lines is diﬀerent for high and for
low ﬁeld strength, for any given ﬁeld strength there are two disjoint contours. The

Semiclassical ionization dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion

transition between the diﬀerent topologies occurs for the critical ﬁeld strength ˜Fc
where the disjoint contours merge and intersect at right angles. It can be inferred
from ﬁgure 1(a) that ˜Fc is the maximum ﬁeld strength taken on the x-axis. From this
observation we can calculate that ˜Fc = 4/(3√3) = 0.7698.

We now turn to a description of the direction of the two-centre Coulomb ﬁeld,
which is illustrated in ﬁgure 1(b). We ﬁrst look for those locations where the ﬁeld
is perpendicular to the molecular axis. Due to symmetry, it is clear that this is the
case on the ˜x-axis.
In addition, 90-degree angle lines emanate from either nucleus
and join the ˜x-axis at ˜x = √2. As can be seen from ﬁgure 1(b), they partition each
quadrant of the ˜x˜z-plane into an “inner” region close to ˜x = ˜z = 0 and an “outer”
region at large ˜x and ˜z. The angle lines for angles φ < 90◦ ﬁll the outer region of the
quadrant ˜z > 0 and the inner region of the quadrant ˜z < 0. Symmetrically, the angle
lines for φ > 90◦ ﬁll the inner region of the quadrant ˜z > 0 and the outer region of
= 90◦ has two disjoint parts. The
the quadrant ˜z < 0. Thus, any angle line for φ
90-degree angle lines themselves correspond to the critical value where the two parts
of the angle lines connect and change their topology.

Comparing ﬁgures 1(b) and 1(a), it becomes clear that as we follow the outer
part of any angle line from the nucleus out to inﬁnity, the ﬁeld strength will decrease
monotonically from inﬁnity to zero. As a consequence, any ﬁeld strength is assumed
exactly once. If we apply an arbitrary external ﬁeld, we will ﬁnd a unique equilibrium
point on the corresponding outer angle line where the Coulomb ﬁeld exactly cancels
the external ﬁeld. We call it the outer saddle point.

On the inner angle lines, the situation is more complicated. For suﬃciently small
ﬁeld angles φ, the ﬁeld strength along the inner angle line will increase monotonically
from zero to inﬁnity as the line is followed from midpoint to the nucleus. Therefore,
in this case we will ﬁnd a single equilibrium on the inner angle line that will turn out
to be an inner saddle point.

For ﬁeld angles φ close to 90◦, however, the ﬁeld strength along the inner angle
line approximates the ﬁeld strength along the 90-degree line. It rises from zero at the
midpoint to a maximum ˜Fmax(φ)
˜Fc, then decreases to a minimum ˜Fmin(φ) and
ﬁnally increases to inﬁnity at the nucleus. This behaviour is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.
It is found for angles in the interval φmin < φ < φmax, where φmin = 81.6014◦ and
φmin = 98.3986◦. As a consequence, if the ﬁeld angle is chosen in this
φmax = 180◦
interval, there is a unique inner equilibrium if the ﬁeld strength is outside the interval
˜Fmin(φ) < ˜F < ˜Fmax(φ), but there are three inner equilibria if the ﬁeld strength is
within that interval. The domain of ﬁeld strengths and ﬁeld angles where multiple
inner equilibria occur is depicted in ﬁgure 3.

≈

−

For a ﬁeld conﬁguration where three inner equilibria exist, the potential in the
˜x˜z-plane is shown in ﬁgure 4. It exhibits a saddle, a maximum, and a saddle along
the inner angle line. As the external ﬁeld is varied and leaves the region of multiple
equilibria in ﬁgure 3, bifurcations of the equilibria must occur. Speciﬁcally, as the
upper critical ﬁeld strength ˜Fmax is approached from below, the maximum will collide
with the saddle to its left in the ﬁgure and they will annihilate, forming what in the
language of Catastrophe Theory [32, 33] is called a “fold” catastrophe. Similarly, as
the lower critical ﬁeld strength ˜Fmin is approached, the maximum will collide and
annihilate with the saddle below in the ﬁgure.

The most degenerate ﬁeld conﬁguration arises for the extremal angles φmin and
φmax where the lower and upper critical ﬁeld strengths coincide. For these parameter
values, all three inner equilibria coalesce. If we follow the potential along the angle line

lines are indicated for clarity.

in this situation, we ﬁnd a minimum of fourth order. In the parlance of Catastrophe
Theory, this scenario is called a “cusp” catastrophe. It also occurs for φ = 90◦ if the
ﬁeld strength is chosen such that the saddles on the two outer 90-degree lines approach
the ˜x-axis and there coalesce with a maximum on that axis. This bifurcation forms
the lower corner of the “triangle” in ﬁgure 3 that bounds the region of three inner
equilibria.
In all three corners of that triangle, its edges meet tangentially, as is
predicted by the theory of the cusp catastrophe [32, 33].

3.2. The classiﬁcation of equilibria

Once we have found the equilibria of the TCC system in an external electric ﬁeld,
which we have achieved in section 3.1, we must classify them according to the number
of unstable degrees of freedom the dynamics possesses in their neighbourhood. That
number is given by the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian determinant.
We call it the index of the equilibrium point [33]. Note that it suﬃces to discuss
the behaviour of the potential in the ˜x˜z-plane of the three-dimensional potential. The
motion in the ˜y degree of freedom decouples from the dynamics in the symmetry plane
in the harmonic approximation and is always stable: As we move away from the plane,
the distances to both nuclei increase and the potential goes up. Thus, an equilibrium
that is found to be a potential saddle in the plane is a saddle of index one of the three-
dimensional potential. Similarly, a maximum of the planar potential corresponds to a
saddle of index two and a minimum of the planar potential to a minimum (with index
zero) of the three-dimensional potential.

To classify the equilibria of the planar potential, note that the (scaled) planar

Furthermore, since the second derivatives of the linear external potential are zero, we
can evaluate the Hessian of the TCC potential instead of the total potential.

To compute the Hessian at a point P , we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system
(u, v) such that the v-axis is tangential to the angle line through P (see ﬁgure 5). Using
the fact that the TCC electric electric ﬁeld strength ˜FTCC =
˜VTCC, we can rewrite

above. It is illustrated in ﬁgure 2. (The orientation of the angle line chosen there is the
same as the orientation of the v-axis in ﬁgure 5.) The ﬁeld strength is monotonically
increasing along the angle line whenever there is a single inner equilibrium, which
therefore is a saddle. For angles and ﬁeld strengths where three inner equilibria exist,
the ﬁrst and the third encountered along the angle line are in a region of increasing
ﬁeld strength and are therefore saddles, whereas the second is either a maximum or
a minimum of the potential. As long as the angle between the positive v-axis and
the Coulomb ﬁeld is less then 90◦, which is certainly the case in the part of the angle
line that closely follows the ˜x-axis, one can further show that the potential has a
maximum along the angle line if ∂ ˜F /∂v < 0. Thus, the second equilibrium is found
to be a maximum. By a similar argument, it can be shown that the index of the outer
saddle is always one.

4. Classical ionization thresholds

Having found the locations of the saddle points of the TCC potential in an electric
ﬁeld, we now turn to a discussion of their heights, which ultimately determine the
possibility of classical over-the-barrier ionization. We will focus, in particular, on the
dependence of the barrier heights upon the ﬁeld angle. Before a discussion of general
ﬁeld orientations, it will be useful to consider the extremal cases where the electric
ﬁeld is oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the molecular axis.

4.1. Barriers in a perpendicular ﬁeld

The perpendicular ﬁeld conﬁguration is special in that in addition to the reﬂection
symmetry in the xz-plane there is another symmetry with respect to the xy-plane
perpendicular to the molecular axis. As a consequence, saddle points must either lie
in that plane (i.e. on the x-axis) or occur in symmetrical pairs.

If the scaled ﬁeld strength is low, there are an inner and an outer saddle on the
x-axis. With increasing ﬁeld strength, the inner saddle moves outward and the outer
saddle inward. At ˜F = ˜F1 = (2/3)3/2 = 0.5443 the outer saddle crosses the point

Semiclassical ionization dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion

11

˜x = √2 where the outer 90-degree angle lines reach the x-axis. At this point, it turns
into a saddle of index two, and a symmetric pair of saddles of index one on the outer 90-
degree lines is born. As the ﬁeld strength increases further, the latter move toward the
nuclei along the angle lines. The saddle of index two collides and annihilates with the
inner saddle at ˜F = ˜F2 = 4/(3√3) = 0.7698. This leaves only the pair of symmetric
saddles at high ﬁeld strength. Because the 90-degree lines form the boundary between
inner and outer angle lines, these saddles can at will be classiﬁed as either “inner” or
“outer” saddles. Figure 6 illustrates this sequence of events. It also shows that for
most ﬁeld strengths the inner saddle is lower that the outer saddle. As in the case
of an axial ﬁeld [23–25, 27], the inner saddle allows the electron to switch from one
nucleus to the other, not to ionize. Thus, the onset of above-threshold ionization is,
as in the axial conﬁguration, determined by the height of the outer saddle.

4.2. Angle-dependence of the barrier heights

For arbitrary ﬁeld angles φ, the heights of the saddle points interpolate between the
two extremal cases we have just discussed. Their angle dependence is displayed in
ﬁgure 7 for three diﬀerent values of the scaled ﬁeld strength. The most signiﬁcant
feature the heights exhibit is that for all ﬁeld strengths the height of the outer saddle
increases as the ﬁeld angle increases from zero to 90◦, whereas the height of the inner
saddle decreases. Since we have seen in section 4.1 that it is the outer saddle that
is most relevant for ionization, it follows that the molecule is easiest to ionize in the
parallel conﬁguration and that ionization gets harder the larger an angle the external
ﬁeld makes with the molecular axis.

In accordance with what can be seen in ﬁgure 6, the behaviour of the saddle
heights in the vicinity of φ = 90◦ is completely diﬀerent for high and for low ﬁeld
strengths. At low ﬁeld strength ˜F < ˜F1, as in ﬁgure 7(a), an inner and an outer saddle
exist which are non-degenerate. If the ﬁeld strength is increased beyond φ = 90◦, the
saddle heights symmetrically retrace their paths to reach their values at φ = 0◦ again
at φ = 180◦. For this reason, they must have zero slope at φ = 90◦.

For high ﬁeld strengths ˜F > ˜F2, as in ﬁgure 7(c), the two saddles are degenerate
at φ = 90◦. As the angles increase beyond 90◦, the saddles change their roles, the
saddle that was “outer” for φ < 90◦ being “inner” for φ > 90◦ and vice versa. It is
therefore possible for the heights of these saddles to intersect at φ = 90◦ with non-zero
slope. In the intermediate ﬁeld strength regime ˜F1 < ˜F < ˜F2, which is illustrated in
ﬁgure 7(b), both types of behaviour can be observed at the same time.

4.3. Barrier heights as a function of the internuclear distance

So far, we have described the potential saddles as a function of the direction and
the scaled strength of the external electric ﬁeld. While this procedure facilitates the
structural understanding of the saddles and their bifurcations, it is somewhat remote
from experimental conditions where an external ﬁeld of a certain non-scaled strength
is given and the value of the scaled ﬁeld strength depends on the separation of the
nuclei. It can thus change considerably in time if the molecule dissociates under the
inﬂuence of the ﬁeld. To approach this situation, we now turn to a discussion of
the saddle heights as a function of the internuclear distance R for ﬁxed external ﬁeld
strength F . Results are shown in ﬁgure 8 for F = 0.053 38 a.u., which is the peak
ﬁeld strength of a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld with an intensity of 1014 W cm−2. The

This behaviour can be understood by noting that the limit R

ﬁeld angle φ because in the united-atom limit the notion of an intermolecular axis
becomes meaningless. The inner saddle, by contrast, is always located within a few
R of either nucleus. Thus, in the limit R
0 it approaches both nuclei, so that the
saddle height must diverge.

→

In the opposite limit of large internuclear distance, the nuclei are so far apart that
their Coulomb wells barely overlap. Therefore, if an external ﬁeld is present, to each
nucleus there is attached a Stark saddle point whose height relative to the value of the
external potential at the location of the nucleus is given by (10). The nuclei themselves
are displaced to opposite sides from the zero of the external potential, which we have
chosen in (2) to be at the midpoint between the nuclei. The total height of the two
saddles in the separated-atom limit is thus

These asymptotic saddle heights are indicated by the dash-dotted lines in ﬁgure 8.
From ﬁgure 1(b) it becomes clear that the inner saddle is shifted into the direction of
higher external potential, the outer saddle into the direction of lower potential. Thus,
the inner saddle height must approach the higher of the two asymptotic values (11)
while the outer saddle height approaches the lower value.

Due to the asymptotic behaviour (11), the height of the inner saddle increases with
R for large internuclear distances, the height of the lower saddle decreases. However,

the distance-dependence of the asymptotic heights (11) becomes slight when the angle
approaches 90◦, so that the asymptotic behaviour sets in only for very large distances.
Thus, for large angles we ﬁnd that the outer barrier height is actually increasing with
the internuclear separation over the physically relevant range of distances.

≈

At ﬁrst sight, the bifurcations of the inner saddles seem to have no impact
whatsoever on the behaviour of the barrier heights in ﬁgure 8. Upon a closer look,
however, one discovers a little “knee” in the inner saddle height for φ = 85◦ at
7.5 a.u. At this point the curve seems to change its slope discontinuously. If
R
we enlarge this part of the curve, as shown in ﬁgure 9, we ﬁnd that this is indeed the
region where the bifurcations take place. In a small range of internuclear distances,
a new saddle of index one is created and the previously-existing saddle is destroyed.
This shift from one saddle to the other gives rise to the apparently discontinuous bend
observed in ﬁgure 8(b).

5. Tunnelling ionization

Even if the electron energy is below the barrier height discussed in section 4, ionization
can still take place due to quantum mechanical tunnelling.
In atoms, this process
is commonly described in the framework of the ADK model [18], which uses the
ionization rate of a hydrogen atom or a hydrogen-like ion in a static external ﬁeld.
In that system, ionization takes place predominantly along the axis of the external
electric ﬁeld, so that the description of the ionization process reduces to an essentially
one-dimensional tunnelling calculation which matches the wave function within the
well to the ionizing parts of the wave function beyond the barrier. To generalize this
approach to the ionization of molecules, a double modiﬁcation is necessary: On the one
hand, a molecular wave function is anisotropic, so that the ionization rate will depend
on the direction in which ionization is taking place, i.e. on the direction of the external
ﬁeld. On the other hand, in the complicated potential (2), unlike for the hydrogen
atom in an electric ﬁeld [34, 35], the diﬀerent degrees of freedom do not decouple, so
that the tunnelling process cannot be regarded as essentially one-dimensional. This
coupling of the diﬀerent degrees of freedom must also be taken into account.

Recently, Tong et al [17] proposed a generalization of the ADK model of tunnelling
ionization to the ionization of diatomic molecules. They take into account the

Semiclassical ionization dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion

15

anisotropy of the bound-state molecular wave function, but they retain an essentially
one-dimensional picture of the tunnelling process and fail to discuss the impact of
multiple coupled degrees of freedom. We will here analyze the tunnelling paths for the
hydrogen molecular ion in a non-axial electric ﬁeld and thereby elucidate the reason
why the quasi one-dimensional approach of Tong et al could succeed even though the
eﬀects of the additional degrees of freedom were neglected.

Diﬀerent approaches to the theory of barrier-suppression ionization are surveyed
by Kra˘ınov [36]. We will here adopt a semiclassical description of the ionization
process. Within that framework, the tunnelling transmission probability through a
barrier [37]

is determined by the action integral

the (imaginary) momentum the electron has at the position x below the barrier,
V (x) > E. Kra˘ınov [36] gives a formula for the tunnelling probability in the case
of a hydrogen atom in an electric ﬁeld that is obtained from (12) if the barrier is
assumed parabolic. In its more general form, equation (12) is applicable to parabolic
as well as non-parabolic barriers and in one as well as several degrees of freedom. In
one dimension, the action (13) is computed along the unique path leading from one
side of the barrier to the other. In several dimensions, however, an inﬁnity of possible
tunnelling paths connect the region of bound motion at a given energy to the region
of free motion, and it is not obvious along what path the tunnelling action (13) should
be taken. A similar diﬃculty arises if the strictly quantum mechanical method of
the phase functions [36] is used in multiple degrees of freedom. Thus, we expect the
results described below to be valuable beyond the limits of the semiclassical theory.

If reactant and product regions of conﬁguration space are separated by a saddle
point in a multidimensional potential, the path of steepest descent from the saddle is
regarded as the “reaction path” in chemistry (see, e.g., [38]). However, it is also well
known that the tunnelling integral taken along that path can severely underestimate
the extent of tunnelling. To obtain the transmission probability correctly, the path
must be chosen such as to maximize (12), i.e. to minimize the tunnelling action (13).
In cases where the reaction path is strongly curved, the tunnelling path lies on its
concave side (“corner cutting”) [39], which shortens the path and helps minimize the
tunnelling action.

Through (14) the optimum tunnelling path depends crucially on the details of
the potential, or equivalently the dynamics, in the vicinity of the saddle point. To
analyze it, it is helpful to allow coordinates, momenta and the time to assume complex
rather than real values. This artiﬁce allows us extend the classical dynamics to the
region below the barrier and makes the full machinery of classical dynamics available
to an analysis of the tunnelling process.
If we do so, by virtue of Maupertuis’
principle [35] the requirement to minimize the tunnelling action (13) translates into
the condition that the tunnelling path be the conﬁguration space projection of a
classical trajectory. In addition, the tunnelling path must start and end on the energy

Semiclassical ionization dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion

16

contour V (x) = E, where the real dynamics can take over. At these points, it must
have zero momentum. Using the time-reversal invariance of the dynamics described
by the Hamiltonian (1), we can conclude that the tunnelling orbit must be periodic.
This leads us to the prescription to identify the optimum tunnelling path as the
conﬁguration space projection of an imaginary-time complex periodic orbit under the
potential barrier. Equivalently, it can be found as the projection of a real periodic
orbit in the inverted potential [40].

Using the above prescription, we can compute the tunnelling paths for arbitrary
external ﬁeld strengths, ﬁeld directions and tunnelling energies. Results for a scaled
external ﬁeld strength ˜F = 0.5 are shown in ﬁgure 10. These tunnelling paths show
the expected shift to the concave side of the reaction path, but the amount of corner
cutting is small because, especially for small angles and for the outer saddle, the
reaction path is close to a straight line. This is a clear indication of quasi one-
dimensional tunnelling dynamics.

Even more striking is the behaviour of the tunnelling actions shown in ﬁgure 11.
The curves in ﬁgure 11(a) present the energy-dependence of the tunnelling action
below the outer saddle for diﬀerent angles. They diﬀer mainly in the height of the
saddle point in which they originate. This is especially clear when all energies are
referred to the respective saddle point energies, as in ﬁgure 11(b). In this case, all
action curves nearly coincide. An exception is formed by the curve for φ = 90◦. This
curve is lying on the x-axis, as are both saddle points.
If the energy is below the
height of the inner saddle, the periodic tunnelling orbit will cross that saddle and the
tunnelling path described above will cease to exist. The presence of the second saddle
distorts the action curve away from the universal behaviour of the other curves and
ﬁnally causes it to end.

The nearly universal tunnelling dynamics is due to the fact that the outer saddle,
especially for small ﬁeld angles, is much closer to one of the nuclei than to the other.
Thus, the neighbourhood of the saddle is very similar to that of the Stark saddle
encountered in a single atom in an electric ﬁeld. The tunnelling dynamics is therefore
similar the atomic tunnelling dynamics, and the ionization rate is closely approximated
by the ADK rate once the distortion of the molecular wave function through the
presence of the second nucleus is taken into account. The tunnelling rate will, however,
depend on the ﬁeld angle through the height of the saddle. Very similar results are
found for the higher scaled ﬁeld strength ˜F = 0.75.

The universality of the tunnelling dynamics is even more pronounced for the
lower scaled ﬁeld strength ˜F = 0.053 38, which is the peak ﬁeld strength in a linearly
−2. In this case, the inner saddle
polarized laser beam with an intensity of 1014W cm
point is very close to the origin ˜x = ˜z = 0, so that the inner tunnelling paths lie
virtually on the ˜z-axis. The outer saddle is located at a scaled distance from the
origin between 6.35 at φ = 0 and 6.00 at φ = 90◦. For these large distances, we
approach the united-atom limit, which explains why the angle dependence of the
distance is slight. As a further consequence, both the saddle shapes and saddle heights
are well approximated by the Stark saddle of the united atom, as is conﬁrmed by the
tunnelling actions shown in ﬁgure 12. We ﬁnd not only that the outer saddle height is
virtually independent of the ﬁeld angle, but also that the tunnelling action is a nearly
universal function of the tunnelling energy for all angles including φ = 90◦. At this
ﬁeld strength, the inner saddle is suﬃciently far away from the outer saddle so that it
does not cause any distortion or singularity in the energy range shown.

around I = 1014 W cm−2, which corresponds to a peak ﬁeld strength of F =
0.053 38 a.u. and, for an internuclear separation of 2 a.u., to the scaled ﬁeld strength
of ˜F
0.053 38 we have studied above. It is well within the range of ﬁeld strengths
where the angle-independent behaviour of the united-atom limit holds. For a neutral
molecule, in particular a non-hydrogenic molecule as in [17], the eﬀective potential
experienced by the ionizing electron is more complicated than the potential (2) due
to the presence of the inner electrons. However, these deviations from Coulombic
behaviour arise mainly in the vicinity of the nuclei. For the (on an atomic scale) weak
ﬁelds relevant to [17], the saddle is far away from the nuclei and we can expect the
simple potential (2) to approximate the true tunnelling dynamics well.

We can therefore conclude that for small ﬁeld strengths the eﬀects of reaction path
curvature that were not considered by Tong et al have little impact on the tunnelling
ionization of a molecule because the electron is essentially subject to the Coulomb ﬁeld
of the united nuclei. They will become even smaller when averaged over the external
ﬁeld direction. This observation explains why the quasi-atomic tunnelling theory
of [17] could succeed without taking these dynamical eﬀects into account. At the
same time, the angle-independence of the tunnelling dynamics explains why previous
theories of ionization that only deal with the special case of an axial ﬁeld [15, 23–28]
yield results in resonable agreement with experiment although in an experiment one
has no control over the relative orientations of the molecule and the ﬁeld.

In the opposite limit of strong external ﬁeld, we regain a similar universal
tunnelling dynamics because the saddle points approach individual nuclei and the
inﬂuence of the remote nucleus becomes small. As we have found only small deviations
from universal quasi-atomic dynamics even for intermediate ﬁeld strength, we can
conclude that the eﬀects of reaction path curvature are small for all ﬁeld strengths.

6. Conclusion

As a ﬁrst step toward an understanding of the electronic dynamics of the hydrogen
molecular ion in an electric ﬁeld of arbitrary orientation, we have presented a detailed
discussion of the saddle points of the relevant potential. We have found that the saddle
points bifurcate as the external electric ﬁeld strength and direction are varied, which
gives us a ﬁrst glimpse of the richness the full dynamics of the system must possess. We
used our knowledge of the saddle points to describe both the onset of over-the-barrier
ionization and the dynamics of tunnelling ionization below the saddle points, which
shed new light on the success of a recent theory of molecular tunnelling ionization [17]
as well as previous theories that treat the special case of axial ﬁelds [15, 23–26].

The presentation of the dynamics near the saddle points in the hydrogen molecular
ion opens several directions of further investigation: Firstly,
it calls for a more
thorough investigation of the dynamics within the wells. One can expect to ﬁnd a
wealth of intricate classical structure that could illuminate the ﬁner details of the
molecular ionization process, both above and below the classical threshold. Secondly,
the connection to quantum mechanics must be established to determine the energies
and widths of the bound states within the well in a way analogous to the one-
dimensional calculations of [41–43]. Thirdly, with regard to Rydberg plasmas it is
essential to include the Coulomb ﬁelds of the surrounding ions and to allow for the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion in an
electric ﬁeld of arbitrary direction oﬀers a rich and fascinating ﬁeld of inquiry whose
investigation we have here only just begun.

The photoionization cross-sections of two even-parity excited states, 5d6d 3D1 and 6s7d 3D2,
of atomic Ba at the ionization-laser wavelength of 556.6 nm were measured. We found that the
total cross-section depends on the relative polarization of the atoms and the ionization-laser light.
With density-matrix algebra, we show that, in general, there are at most three parameters in the
photoionization cross-section. Some of these parameters are determined in this work. We also
present the measurement of the radiative lifetime of ﬁve even-parity excited states in Ba in the
appendix.

INTRODUCTION

The photoionization cross-sections of atoms have been
studied for decades [1]. With tunable lasers, it is pos-
sible to obtain high populations and polarizations of se-
lected excited states even if these states have short life-
times. We present here measurements of photoionization
cross-sections for excited states of Ba, which have been
made possible by this approach. The measurements of
photoionization cross-sections of atoms in excited states
are valuable for testing atomic theory, and are impor-
tant for understanding of processes in plasmas, including
stellar atmospheres, lighting devices, etc. A number of
previous studies have observed that the photoionization
cross-section of polarized atoms depends on the polariza-
tion of the light [2, 3, 4]. In this work, we measured the
photoionization cross-sections and studied their polariza-
tion dependence for the 5d6d 3D1 and 6s7d 3D2 states
of neutral barium at the ionization-laser wavelength of
556.6 nm.
In addition to the applications mentioned
above, our measurements are also useful for the analysis
of experiments with Ba searching for violation of Bose-
Einstein statistics (BEV) for photons [5, 6].

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Two pulsed dye lasers are used to excite barium atoms
in an atomic beam to the even-parity states of interest
via two successive E1 transitions. The barium atoms in
the probed state can be ionized by a third pulsed dye
laser (Fig. 1).

FIG. 1: The excitation-detection scheme. The probed states
are 5d6d 3D1 and 6s7d 3D2 states. Solid arrows indicate laser
excitation; the hollow arrow indicates ﬂuorescence. The ﬂuo-
rescence is detected with a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The
ionization is detected by the induced charge on the electrodes,
which is converted to a voltage signal by a preampliﬁer.

The apparatus used (Fig. 2) is largely the same as in
previous experiments [7, 8]. The barium beam is pro-
duced with an eﬀusive source with a multi-slit nozzle that
collimates the angular spread of the beam to
0.1 rad
in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The oven,
heat-shielded with tantalum foil, is resistively heated to
700◦C, corresponding to saturated barium pressure in

pulse energy of the ionization-laser beam is
10 mJ. A
1-mm-thick coated etalon is inserted in the ionization-
laser-beam path before the entrance of the beam into the
chamber. We can adjust the pulse energy of the ion-
ization laser beam by tilting the etalon. In order not to
change the laser beam path signiﬁcantly, we set the etalon
surface almost perpendicular to the laser-beam path (at
5◦), so the etalon parallel-shifts the beam by
an angle
less than 0.1 mm. After the interaction region, the ion-
ization laser beam passes through an exit window, with a
transmission rate of 89(2)% and the 1.01-mm iris, and is
split by a wedged piece of fused-silica glass. The energy
of one of the split beams is measured by a photodiode.
To calibrate the photodiode as an energy meter, we mea-
sure the energy of the through beam (with energy 90(3)%
of that before the splitter) and the output voltage of the
photodiode simultaneously, and ﬁt them to a linear func-
tion. The nonlinear deviation is found to be < 2% and is
statistically negligible. We estimate the photon ﬂux den-
sity with the assumption that the intensity of the light in
the interaction region is homogenous and is proportional
to that of the light measured by the photodiode. The
error due to this assumption is
10% in the photoion-
ization cross-section (see Section V).

Fluorescence resulting from spontaneous decay to a
lower-lying state is detected at 45◦ to both the atomic
and excitation-laser beams with a 2-in.-diameter PMT
105 (with an

An electric ﬁeld of

1 kV/cm in the interaction region
is supplied by two plane-parallel electrodes. A detailed
description of the electrodes can be found in Ref. [7].
The purpose of the electric ﬁeld is to separate the ions
and the free electrons, which are mutually attracted due
to the induced electric ﬁeld of the space charge. The
number of ions produced at highest ionization light power

resulting in an electric ﬁeld of
a ﬁeld that is larger than the space-charge ﬁeld. On
the other hand, the electric ﬁeld should be suﬃciently
low to avoid excessive Stark-induced level mixing. An
applied electric ﬁeld of 1 kV/cm can cause < 3% of Stark-
induced mixing for speciﬁc levels of interests. Ions and
free electrons are detected by the induced charge on the
electrodes, which is converted to a voltage signal by a
preampliﬁer (Tennelec TC174).

The three tunable dye lasers used in this experiment
(Quanta Ray PDL-2, all with Fluorescein 548 dye) are
pumped by two pulsed frequency-doubled Nd-YAG lasers
(Quanta Ray DCR-11 and Quantel YAG580). The Quan-
tel laser operates at a repetition rate of 10 Hz and slaves
the Quanta Ray laser. The relative timing of the two
7-ns-long laser pulses can be controlled to within
∼
1 ns. The output of the Quantel laser is split by a
beam splitter. One of the resultant light beams is used
to pump the (ﬁrst) dye laser set on resonance with the
6s2 1S0 →
553.7 nm). The
other light beam pumps the (third) dye laser, which is
used to ionize the barium atoms from the probed states.
The wavelength of the third dye laser is set to 556.6 nm,
which is relevant to the BEV experiment. The (second)
dye laser, set on resonance with the transition from the
6s6p 1P1 state to the probed state, is pumped by the
Quanta Ray Nd-YAG laser. The spectral width of each
of the dye-laser pulses is
20 GHz. The spatial pro-
∼
ﬁle of the dye-laser beam is approximately Gaussian, as
measured with a CCD camera. The Gaussian diameters
of the laser beams in the interaction region are adjusted
to be
4 mm. The relative timing between the pulses
of the ﬁrst and second dye lasers (excitation lasers) is
set to maximize the population of the probed state, at
which point the pulses nearly coincide. The pulse of the
third dye laser (ionization laser) arrives in the interac-
tion region
30 ns later, delayed by a spatial distance.
The excitation laser beams are sent into the chamber
in the same direction, while the ionization laser beam
propagates in the anti-parallel direction. The laser-beam
paths are spatially overlapped. An iris with a diameter of
1.01(2) mm is inserted before the entrance of the excita-
tion laser beams (which is also the exit of the ionization-
50 cm away from the interaction region.
laser beam),
The purpose of the iris is to control the spatial distri-
bution of the atoms in the probed states so that all the
atoms in the excited state are approximately uniformly

In this work, we study the dependence of the photoion-
ization cross-section on the relative polarizations between
atoms and the ionization laser. To produce diﬀerent po-
larizations of the atoms in the probed state, we vary the
polarizations of the excitation-laser beams with half-wave
plates and purify the polarizations with polarizers.

±

We use the polarization of the linearly polarized ioniza-
tion laser light to deﬁne the quantization axis ˆz. Because
the excitation and ionization laser beams propagate along
the same axis, deﬁned as the x-axis, and light is trans-
verse, the polarization of the excitation-laser beams can
only be in the ˆy-ˆz plane. For a J = 1 probed state,
only M =
1 Zeeman sublevels can be coherently ex-
cited (Fig. 3). The M = 0 sublevel cannot be excited be-
cause the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient for a
J = 1
J ′ = 1 transition is zero. For a J = 2 probed
state, three diﬀerent polarizations of the state can be ob-
tained (Fig. 4). When both excitation lasers are polarized
along the z-axis, the M = 0 sublevel is populated. When
one of the excitation lasers is polarized along the z-axis
and the other is polarized along the y-axis, M =
1 sub-
levels are coherently excited. When the polarizations of
both lasers are along the y-axis, M =
2 and M = 0
sublevels can be coherently excited.

III. THEORY

A. Photoionization Cross-Section

In this subsection, we show that there are at most three
parameters in the total photoionization cross-section us-
ing density-matrix algebra (see, for example, Ref. [9, 10]).
Assuming that the wavelength of the ionization photons
is much longer than the size of an atom, we only consider
electric-dipole transitions.

The density matrix describing an ensemble of atoms in
a state with total angular momentum J can be expressed
in the basis of its 2J + 1 Zeeman components.

cient vanishes in this case. Case (d) is physically equivalent
to case (c); however, in this basis the Clebsch-Gordan sup-
pression of case (c) shows up as a cancellation of coherent

ized initial atomic state or/and an unpolarized ionization
light source,1 the photoionization cross-section is σ0. If
both of atoms and light are polarized, the cross section
may be diﬀerent depending on their relative orientation
(σ1) and their relative alignment (σ2).

B. Formulae for σ0,1,2

for states of arbitrary angular momenta. Consider an en-

1 Here the unpolarized light source means that the diagonal ele-
ments of the density matrix of the light are equal and the oﬀ-
diagonal elements are all zero. A directional light beam cannot
be unpolarized in this deﬁnition because of the lack of the po-
larization along its propagation direction. Such light that can
be “unpolarized” in the sense of the common deﬁnition through
Stoke’s parameters, in fact, possesses alignment along the prop-
agation direction.

that the M = 0 sublevel can be excited if both lasers are
polarized in the ˆz direction. Plot (b) shows that a coherent
superposition of M = ±2 and M = 0 sublevels can be excited
if both lasers are polarized in the ˆy direction. Plots (c) and
(d) show that a coherent superposition of M = ±1 sublevels
can be excited if one laser is polarized in the ˆz direction and
the other is polarized in the ˆy direction.

The photoionization process is related to the density
matrices of the ionizing photons and the probed state.
Because total photoionization cross-section is a scalar
(since we did not study the angular distribution of the
ions), the irreducible tensors of the density matrix of the
photons should be contracted with those of the atoms of
the same ranks. The photoionization cross-section can
be expressed as:

If we adjust the polarizations of both excitation-laser
beams to be parallel, the ﬂuorescence signal due to the
spontaneous decay of the 5d6d 3D1 state to the 6s6p 3P1
state detected by the PMT drops signiﬁcantly (by more
than a factor of 20) compared to the case of parallel po-
larizations and almost no ion signal is detected. As the
excitation transition is nearly saturated when the polar-
ization of two excitation-laser beams are perpendicular,
the residual signal may be attributed to the imperfection
of the polarizer ﬁlms (polarization directions and stray
ellipticity are controlled within 5◦.)

B. The 6s7d 3D2 state

Three diﬀerent alignments of this state were excited
with diﬀerent combinations of the polarizations of the
two excitation lasers. Following the same approach as
we used for the 5d6d 3D1 state, we get that

V. SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERROR

APPENDIX A: RADIATIVE LIFETIME
MEASUREMENT

The dominant source of the systematic error comes
from our oversimpliﬁed model of the spatial proﬁle
and the temporal distribution of the intensity of the
ionization-laser pulses. The spatial proﬁle of the ioniza-
tion laser is approximately Gaussian, with a diameter of
4 mm. We measure the energy of the laser pulse that
∼
passes through the 1.01-mm-diameter iris and approxi-
mate the intensity as a constant. A calculation shows
that this approximation may cause an up-to-(+10%) cor-
rection on the photoionization cross section. This cor-
rection is hard to estimate more accurately because the
excitation and ionization transitions are partially satu-
rated. The temporal distribution of the intensity, which
is modelled as a square function, can be actually very
7 ns and
complicated. In our case of τl/τ
τ
30 ns), a numerical calculation shows that the vari-
ation of the ﬁt cross-section is within 4% with several
trial functions for the temporal distribution. A secondary
source of experimental systematic is the 5% uncertainty
on the calibration function of the photodiode used as an
energy meter. Other sources of systematic error, includ-
ing the determination of the polarizations of the laser
beams (< 2%) and the nonlinearity of the photodiode
(< 2%), are found to be negligible. Overall, all the pho-
toionization cross-sections measured in this work have a
systematic uncertainty of
12%. In Table III, we have

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have measured the photoionization
cross-sections of the 5d6d 3D1 and 6s7d 3D2 states
of Ba with the ionization-laser wavelength 556.6 nm.
We found that the photoionization cross-section of the
6s7d 3D2 state depends on the relative polarizations of
the atomic state and the ionization laser beam. We have
introduced a general tensor formalism of polarization-
dependent photoionization cross-sections and determined

In section IV, it has been shown that the temporal evo-
lution of ion signals studied in this work depends on the
radiative lifetimes of the probed states. Using almost the
same experimental setup, we have measured the radiative
lifetimes of ﬁve even-parity excited states of Ba.

The barium atoms in an atomic beam, with estimated

are excited by pulsed lasers to the even-parity states
of interest via two E1 transitions. For diﬀerent probed
states, diﬀerent combinations of the accessible lasers, in-
cluding a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (wavelength
532 nm) and dye lasers with Rhodamine 6G (wave-
∼
570 nm) or Fluorescein 548 (wavelength
length 556
546
567 nm), are used for the excitation. Some states
of interest may be probed by diﬀerent combinations of
lasers as a check of consistency. In some cases of lifetime
measurement, atoms can be ﬁrst excited to the 6s6p 1P1
state eﬃciently by the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission
(ASE) of the dye laser because the transition probability
6s6p 1P1 is large; therefore, only one dye
of 6s2 1S0 →
laser is used to excite a two-step E1-E1 transition.

Fluorescence resulting from spontaneous decay to a
lower-lying odd-parity state was detected with a PMT.
A color glass ﬁlter was used to reduce scattered light
from the lasers and interference ﬁlters with 10-nm band-
width were used to select the decay channel of inter-
est. We recorded the time-dependent ﬂuorescence signals
with a digital oscilloscope and analyzed data with a per-
sonal computer running the Mathematica program. We
recorded ﬂuorescence signals without averaging because
we found that the averaging in general elongates the ap-
parent lifetime and the ﬁtted lifetime is sensitive to the
number of the averaged samples. This probably the re-
sult of jitter in the triggering of the oscilloscope and/or
the lasers.

We determine the radiative lifetime of a probed state
by ﬁtting the ﬂuorescence signal due to spontaneous de-
cay with an exponential function:

FIG. 6: The ﬂuorescence signal due to the spontaneous decay
of 6s7d 3D2 state. The data points with time later than 80 ns
are ﬁt to an exponential function.

where a is the signal amplitude, τ is the radiative lifetime
of the probed state, b is the constant background and
the probed state is populated at t = 0 (Fig. 6). It can
be shown (APPENDIX B) that we can avoid the eﬀects
of the ﬁnite PMT response time, the ﬁnite laser pulse
width and the ﬁnite oscilloscope response time if only
the data points with time suﬃciently long after the laser
excitation are used in the ﬁtting.

In the data analysis, only data points later than a cer-
tain time, t0(> 0), were ﬁt to an exponential function.
The ﬁtted lifetime may vary with t0 if t0 is not suﬃciently
long. As t0 increases, the ﬁtted lifetime will approach a
consistent value, which means that the eﬀects of PMT
response etc. become negligible (Fig. 7). Typically, we
found that when t0 is greater than
75 ns, the ﬁtting
gives a consistent lifetime.

∼

The lifetimes determined in this work are listed in Ta-
ble IV. The lifetimes of the same probed states were mea-
sured from the ﬂuorescence signals with diﬀerent excita-
tion schemes (diﬀerent combinations of lasers or ASE)
and diﬀerent detection schemes (diﬀerent IFs). The ﬁt-
ting gives consistent results. Comparing this work with
previous experiments, we found that the lifetimes of the
6s7d 3D2 and 6s7d 3D1 states disagree with those re-
ported in Ref. [12] by more than two standard devia-
tions. The lifetimes of 5d6d 3S1 and 5d6d 3D1 states
agree with the previous results within one standard de-
viation [12, 13].

Sources of systematic errors may result from the ﬁnite
response time, afterpulses and nonlinearity of the PMT.
We found that these systematic uncertainties can be min-
imized < 1%, which is much smaller than statistical un-
certainties, by appropriate experimental procedure. To
avoid any possible detection of unexpected cascade ﬂuo-
rescence channels with wavelength “coincidentally” close
to the target ﬂuorescence, we have searched all the pos-
sible decay transitions according to the latest updated

FIG. 7: A typical plot of ﬁtted lifetime as a function of t0. The
error bar is one standard deviation of statistical uncertainty.
The ﬁtted lifetime varies as t0 increases. Typically, when
t0 > 75 ns, the ﬁtting gives a consistent lifetime, which means
that the eﬀect of PMT response, ﬁnite temporal width of laser
pulse etc. is negligible.

We have also used diﬀerent IFs for the same decay chan-
nels. They all give a consistent lifetime. In data analysis,
we also subtract the temporal ﬂuorescence data by oﬀ-
resonance data to eliminate the eﬀect of the scattered
light and any oﬀ-resonance interactions.

pulse is about 7 ns. The lifetimes of the probed states are
all less than 40 ns. Therefore, the systematic eﬀect due
to these ﬁnite responses should be considered. In the fol-
lowing discussion, we will prove that this eﬀect becomes
negligible if only data points with time suﬃciently long
after the laser pulses are considered.

The ﬂuorescence signal due to a spontaneous decay can

be expressed as an exponential function:

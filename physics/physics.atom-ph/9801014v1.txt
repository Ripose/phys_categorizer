The ground and some excited states of the Li atom in external uniform magnetic ﬁelds are

calculated by means of our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method for ﬁeld strengths ranging from zero up
to 2.35 · 108T. With increasing ﬁeld strength the ground state undergoes two transitions involving
three diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations: for weak ﬁelds the ground state conﬁguration arises from
the ﬁeld-free 1s22s conﬁguration, for intermediate ﬁelds from the 1s22p−1 conﬁguration and in high
ﬁelds the 1s2p−13d−2 electronic conﬁguration is responsible for the properties of the atom. The
transition ﬁeld strengths are determined. Calculations on the ground state of the Li+ ion allow us
to describe the ﬁeld-dependent ionization energy of the Li atom. Some general arguments on the

ground states of multi-electron atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds are provided.

I. INTRODUCTION

The behaviour and properties of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds is a subject of increasing interest. On the o.h.s. this
is motivated by the astrophysical discovery of strong ﬁelds on white dwarfs and neutron stars [1–3] and on the o.h.s.

the competition of the diamagnetic and Coulombic interaction causes a rich variety of complex properties which are of
interest on their own. Investigations on the electronic structure in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld appear to be quite
complicated due to the mixed geometry of this quantum problem (mixing of spherical and cylindrical symmetry).
There are many works on the hydrogen atom (for a list of references see [4–7]) and several works on the He atom as
well as He-like ions [8–12]. Other atoms however have been investigated only in a very few cases [11,13,14].

For the hydrogen atom the impact of the mixed symmetry is particularly evident and at the same time pronounced
in the intermediate ﬁeld regime for which the magnetic and Coulomb forces are comparable. For diﬀerent electronic
degrees of excitation of the atom the intermediate regime is met for diﬀerent absolute values of the ﬁeld strength.
For the ground state the boundaries of this regime can be deﬁned in a rough manner as the range γ = 0.2 − 20
(γ = B/B0, B is the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B0 = ¯hc/ea2
0 = 2.3505·105T; atomic units will be used in the following).
With increasing degree of excitation the domain of the intermediate ﬁelds lowers correspondingly and becomes, as a
rule, wider on a logarithmic scale of γ. Both early [15] and more recent works [5,16–19] on the hydrogen atom have
used diﬀerent approaches for relatively weak ﬁelds (the Coulomb force prevails over the magnetic force) and for very
strong ﬁelds where the Coulomb force can be considered as weak in comparison with the magnetic forces (adiabatic
limit). In early works the Coulomb ﬁeld was considered in this limit actually as perturbation for a free electron in
a superstrong magnetic ﬁeld. The motion of an electron parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is governed in the adiabatic
approximation [20] by a 1D quasi-Coulomb potential with a parameter, dependent on the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
The detailed calculations of the hydrogen energy levels carried out by R¨osner et al [5] also retain the separation of
the magnetic ﬁeld strength domains due to decomposing the electronic wave function in terms of either spherical
(for weak ﬁelds) or cylindrical harmonics (for strong ﬁelds). A powerful method to obtain comprehensive results on
low-lying energy levels in the intermediate regime in particular for the hydrogen atom is provided by mesh methods
[6].

1

For atoms with several electrons the problem of the mixed symmetries is even more intricate than for hydrogen
because diﬀerent electrons feel very diﬀerent Coulomb forces, i.e. possess diﬀerent single-particle energies, and the
domain of the intermediate ﬁelds therefore appears to be the sum of the intermediate domains for the separate
electrons.

There exist several investigations on two-electron atoms in the literature [8–12,14,21–25]. The majority of them

deals with the adiabatic limit in superstrong ﬁelds. Most of the early works are Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations for
the strong ﬁeld domain. There are also several variational calculations for the low-ﬁeld domain [22,26,27] including
calculations by Larsen [22] made at γ ≤ 2 for He atom and at γ ≤ 5 for H−. The latter calculations can be used for
evaluations of the correlation energy in the low-ﬁeld domain. HF calculations [9] are carried out analogously to the
approach in ref. [5] with applying two diﬀerent sets of basis functions to the high- and low-ﬁeld domains. As a result
of the complicated geometry in the intermediate regime this approach inherently suﬀers from very slow convergence
properties with respect to the energy eigenvalues and yields therefore only a very low accuracy. Accurate calculations
for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths were carried out in refs. [8,10] by the 2D mesh HF method. Investigations on the ground

state as well as a number of excited states of helium including the correlation energy have very recently been performed
via a Quantum Monte Carlo approach [12]. Very recently benchmark results with a precision of 10−4 − 10−6 for the
energy levels have been obtained for a large number of excited states with diﬀerent symmetries using a conﬁguration
interaction approach with an anisotropic Gaussian basis set [28].

For the lithium atom which is the subject of the present work there exists only one recent investigation by Jones et
al [11]. It contains calculations for the ground state and a few low-lying states of the Li atom at weak and intermediate
ﬁelds. Precise Hartree-Fock results for several states in weak ﬁelds and quite satisfactory results for the intermediate
region are presented in this work. However their basis functions did not allow to perform calculations for stronger
ﬁelds. An attempt to deﬁne the sequence of the electronic ground state conﬁgurations which are diﬀerent for diﬀerent

regimes of the ﬁeld strength has also been undertaken in this work. However a detailed qualitative analysis of the high-
ﬁeld ground state conﬁguration was not carried out. As a result the high-ﬁeld ground state electronic conﬁguration
and the transition point to this conﬁguration from the intermediate one is still an open question.

In the current work we apply a fully numerical 2D Hartree-Fock method to the problem of the Li atom in magnetic
ﬁelds of arbitrary strength. This method enables us performing calculations for various states and with approximately
equal precision for weak, intermediate and superstrong magnetic ﬁelds. Our main focus is the ground state of the Li
atom and its ionization energies. To this end several electronic conﬁgurations of the Li atom and two conﬁgurations
of the Li+ ion are studied.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM AND METHOD OF SOLUTION

We solve the electronic Schr¨odinger equation for the lithium atom in a magnetic ﬁeld under the assumption of
an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus in the (unrestricted) Hartree-Fock approximation. The solution is established in the

cylindrical coordinate system (ρ, φ, z) with the z-axis oriented along the magnetic ﬁeld. We prescribe to each electron
a deﬁnite value of the magnetic quantum number mµ. Each single-electron wave function Ψµ depends on the variables
φ and (ρ, z)

Ψµ(ρ, φ, z) = (2π)

−1/2e

−imµφψµ(z, ρ)

(1)

where µ = 1, 2, 3 is the numbering of the electrons. The resulting partial diﬀerential equations for ψµ(z, ρ) and the
formulae for the Coulomb and exchange potentials have been presented in ref. [10].

The one-particle equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ) are solved by means of the fully numerical mesh method
described in refs. [6,10]. The new feature which distinguishes the present calculations from those described in ref.

2

In the present work as well as in ref.
[10] is the method of calculation of the Coulomb and exchange integrals.
[13] we obtain these potentials as solutions of the corresponding Poisson equations. The problem of the boundary
conditions for the Poisson equation as well as the problem of simultaneously solving Poissons equations on the same
meshes with Schr¨odinger-like equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ) have been discussed in ref. [10]. In the present
approach these problems are solved by using special forms of non-uniform meshes. Solutions to the Poisson equation
on separate meshes contain some errors δP associated with an inaccurate description of the potential far from the
nucleus. However due to the special form of the function δP (h) for these meshes (where h is a formal mesh step) the
errors do not show up in the ﬁnal results for the energy and other physical quantities, which we obtain by means of
the Richardson extrapolation procedure (polynomial extrapolation to h = 0 [6,29]). An additional improvement with
respect to the precision of our numerical calculations of the integrals is achieved by solving the Poisson equation not
for the whole charge distribution but for the total distribution minus some properly chosen charge distribution with
known analytical solution to the Poisson equation. Both of these approaches will be described in detail in a separate
work.

Our mesh approach is ﬂexible enough to yield precise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. Some minor decrease of
the precision appears in very strong magnetic ﬁelds. This phenomenon is due to a growing diﬀerence in the binding
energies ǫB µ of single-electron wave functions belonging to the same electronic conﬁguration

ǫB µ = (mµ + |mµ| + 2szµ + 1)γ/2 − ǫµ

(2)

where ǫµ is the single-electron energy and szµ is the spin z-projection. This results in big diﬀerences with respect to the
spatial extension of the density distribution for diﬀerent electrons. This diﬀerence is important for the conﬁgurations
1s22s, 1s2s2p−1 and 1s2p02p−1 and is not important for 1s2p−13d−2 and 1s22p−1 because all the single-electron
energies for the latter states are of the same order of magnitude. The precision of our results depends, of course, on

the number of mesh nodes and can be improved in calculations with denser meshes. The most dense meshes which
we could use in the present calculations had 120 × 120 nodes. These meshes were used for the states 1s22s, 1s2s2p−1
and 1s2p02p−1 at ﬁelds γ = 500 and γ = 1000. For other states and weaker magnetic ﬁelds Richardson’s sequences
of meshes with maximal number 80 × 80 or 60 × 60 were suﬃcient.

III. GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS

We start this section with a qualitative consideration of the problem of the atomic multi-electron ground states
in the limit of strong magnetic ﬁelds. It is clear that the state 1s22s of the lithium atom is the ground state only
for relatively weak ﬁelds. The set of single-electron wave functions for constructing the HF ground state for the
opposite case of extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds can be determined as follows. The nuclear attraction energies and
HF potentials (which determine the motion along z axis) are then small compared to the interaction energies with the
magnetic ﬁeld (which determines the motion perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and is responsible for the Landau
zonal structure of the spectrum). Thus, all the single-electron wave functions must correspond to the lowest Landau
zones, i.e. mµ ≤ 0 for all the electrons, and the system must be fully spin-polarized, i.e. szµ = − 1
2 (↓). For the
Coulomb central ﬁeld the single-electron levels form quasi 1D Coulomb series with the binding energy EB = 1
for
2n2
z
nz > 0 and EB → ∞ for nz = 0, where nz is the number of nodal surfaces of the wave function, which cross the z
axis. These relations between single-electron energies and the geometry of single-electron wave functions along with
analogous relations for the ﬁeld-free atom provide the basis for the following considerations.

It is evident, that the wave functions with nz = 0 have to be choosen for the ground state at γ → ∞. Thus, for
γ → ∞ the ground state of the Li atom must be 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓. This state was not considered in [11] but only

3

the 1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓ conﬁguration was presented. Analogously, the very high-ﬁeld ground state for the C atom
considered in [11] must be the state belonging to the conﬁguration 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓ 4f−3 ↓ 5g−4 ↓ 6h−5 ↓.

The problem of the conﬁguration of the ground state for the intermediate ﬁeld region cannot be solved without doing
explicite calculations. Calculations in ref. [11] were carried out for conﬁgurations with the maximal single-electron
principal quantum number n ≤ 2. Under this restriction calculations for the states 1s22s, 1s22p−1, 1s ↓ 2s ↓ 2p−1 ↓,
and 1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓ are suﬃcient to determine the set of intermediate ground states. Indeed, 1s22s is the zero-ﬁeld
ground state. 1s22p−1 is the lowest excited state of the ﬁeld free atom and (contrary to 1s22s) all the single-electron
wave functions of this state must have inﬁnite binding energies in the inﬁnite strong magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, this
state has the largest binding energy EB

EB =

(mµ + |mµ| + 2szµ + 1)γ/2 − E

(3)

µ=1

in the strong ﬁeld limit due to the fact that ǫB(1s) > ǫB(2p−1) > ǫB(3d−2) > . . . in strong ﬁelds. (For γ = 1000 one
can obtain binding energies from table I as EB(1s22p−1) = 69.1569 and EB(1s2p−13d−2) = 60.0589). The reader
should note that the 1s22p−1 conﬁguration cannot represent the ground state in very strong ﬁelds since it is not fully
spin polarized. The state 1s ↓ 2s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ is the lowest fully spin-polarized state with the single-electron principal
quantum numbers nµ ≤ 2 in weak ﬁelds and, at last, the state 1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓ which lies higher at γ = 0 must
become lower than 1s ↓ 2s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ with increasing ﬁeld strength.

Our calculations include the high-ﬁeld ground state 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓ which contains one electron with n = 3. In
principle, also other conﬁgurations could be considered as possible ground states for intermediate ﬁeld strength. Such
conﬁgurations are 1s23s, 1s23p−1, 1s23d−2, 1s2s3s, 1s2s3p−1, 1s2s3d−2, 1s2p−13s, and 1s2p−13p−1. Calculations
for all these states are possible by means of our mesh HF method. However they are extremely tedious and time
consuming and have not been accomplished in the present work. Indeed we will argue in the following that none of
these states can be the ground state of the Li atom for intermediate ﬁeld strength.

It is quite evident that for the conﬁgurations containing a 1s2 pair of electrons the 1s23s lies higher in energy
than the 1s22s conﬁguration and that the 1s23p−1 and 1s23d−2 conﬁguration possess higher energy than the 1s22p−1
conﬁguration. Thus, the states with 1s2 pairs can be excluded from our argumentation of the ground state. Among
the fully spin polarized conﬁgurations the levels of the conﬁgurations 1s2p−13s, 1s2s3p−1, 1s2s3d−2, and 1s2p−13p−1
are higher than that of the 1s2s2p−1 conﬁguration (two components of the conﬁgurations are identical with those of
1s2s2p−1 and the third one is signiﬁcantly higher). Thus from simple geometrical reasons only the 1s2s3s conﬁguration
(mixed with the 1s2s3d0 conﬁguration) is a priori not excluded from becoming the intermediate ground state. In
weak magnetic ﬁelds this state lies slightly lower than other doubly excited and autoionizing states and in this regime
it is the lowest fully spin-polarized state. But the change of the ground state to the fully spin-polarized conﬁguration

takes place in the vicinity of γ = 2 for which the 3s wave functions is much weaker bound than the 3d−2, 2p−1 and
even 2p0 orbitals. Due to this fact also the 1s2s3s conﬁguration can be excluded from becoming the ground state
for any ﬁeld strength. Indeed our calculations show that this state becomes higher in energy than the 1s2s2p−1 at
γ ≈ 0.16.

Thus, the set 1s22p−1, 1s ↓ 2s ↓ 2p−1 ↓, and 1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓ along with weak- 1s22s and strong-ﬁeld 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓
3d−2 ↓ ground states is comprehensive for the determination of the ground state of the Li atom in a magnetic ﬁeld of
arbitrary strength.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The only work on the Li atom in a magnetic ﬁeld with which we can compare our results is ref. [11].

In this
reference HF calculations were performed for weak and intermediate magnetic ﬁeld strengths. Table I contains the
total energies obtained for the Li atom within our calculations in comparison with the data obtained in [11]. Our
energy values coincide with those of ref. [11] for weak ﬁelds and lie substantially lower in the intermediate regime. At
the upper boundary of the ﬁeld region investigated in [11] the diﬀerence between [11] and our energies is 0.0239 for
the 1s22s state, 0.0205 for the 1s22p−1 state, 0.0870 for the 1s2s2p−1 state, and 0.0458 for the 1s2p02p−1 state.

Our results on the total energies are illustrated in ﬁgures 1 and 2. These ﬁgures show in particular the ground
state conﬁgurations for the diﬀerent regimes of the ﬁeld strength. One can conclude from table I and ﬁgures 1 and
2 that the 1s22s conﬁguration represents the ground state for 0 ≤ γ < 0.17633, for 0.17633 < γ < 2.153 the ground
state conﬁguration is 1s22p−1, and for γ > 2.153 the ground state conﬁguration is 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓. The state
1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓ presented in [11] as the high ﬁeld ground state appears not to be the ground state of the Li atom
for any magnetic ﬁeld strength.

Figure 3 presents spatial distributions of the total electronic densities for the ground state conﬁgurations of the
lithium atom. In each row these densities are presented for the limits of the corresponding ﬁeld strength regions
including the transition points and for some value of the intermediate ﬁeld strength in between. For each separate

conﬁguration the eﬀect of the increasing ﬁeld strength consists in compressing the electronic distribution towards the
z axis. For the 1s2p−13d−2 conﬁguration for which all single-electron binding energies increase unlimited for γ → ∞
a shrinking process of this distribution in z direction is also visible. For the 1s22p−1 conﬁguration this eﬀect is not
distinct for the relevant ﬁeld strengths. For the 1s22s state the opposite eﬀect can be observed: the 2s electronic
charge distribution along the z axis expands slightly in weak magnetic ﬁelds. A characteristic feature of the transition
points is an inﬂation of the electronic distribution in ρ direction during transitions from lower- to higher-ﬁeld ground
state conﬁgurations. This eﬀect occurs due to the prevailing of the lowering in energy with changing quantum numbers
3
(m = 0 to m = −1 for the transition point γ = 0.17633 and Sz = P
µ=1 szµ = −1/2 to Sz = −3/2 for γ = 2.153) over
the raising of the energy due to more extended charge distributions in the ρ direction.

The total binding energies of the conﬁgurations 1s22s, 1s22p−1, 1s ↓ 2s ↓ 2p−1 ↓, 1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓ and 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓
3d−2 ↓ are presented in ﬁgure 4. These values do not include spin polarization terms and it can clearly be seen that
the atomic ground state in a magnetic ﬁeld does in general not possess the largest binding energy.

Along with the total energy of the Li atom ground state we have obtained its ionization energies EI dependent
on γ. The total energy values of the ground state of the ion Li+ are required for these calculations. The set of the
ground state conﬁgurations of this two-electron ion is analogous to those of the helium atom [9,10] and consists of
the zero-ﬁeld ground state 1s2 and the strong ﬁeld fully spin-polarized state 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓. Results of our calculations
for these states are presented in table II. The change of the ground state conﬁguration takes place at γ = 2.071814.
Comparing tables I and II one obtains the dependence of the ionization energy of the ground state of the Li atom on
the magnetic ﬁeld strength, as shown in ﬁgure 5. This curve exhibits three distinct points marked by dotted vertical
lines. The ﬁrst of them (from left to right) corresponds to the change of the ground state conﬁguration of the lithium
atom from 1s22s to 1s22p−1. The second corresponds to the change of the Li+ ground state conﬁguration from 1s2 to
1s ↓ 2p−1. And the third, very near to the second one, corresponds to the second change of the Li atom ground state
conﬁguration from 1s22p−1 to 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓. Table II provides the numerical data for the ionization energies.
Tables I and II allow also obtaining ionization energies for other states presented in table I.

In addition we show in ﬁgure 6 the total quadrupole moment

Qzz = hΨ|3z2 − r2|Ψi,

r2 = ρ2 + z2

(4)

of diﬀerent states of the atom as a function of the ﬁeld strength. These dependencies illustrate the changes in the

5

density distribution of the electrons with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength. For weak and also to some extent for
intermediate ﬁeld strengths the main eﬀect consists in compressing the wave function towards the z axis. This results
in increasing Qzz values and a sign change of Qzz for the states with initially negative Qzz. For γ > 10 the continuing
compression towards the z axis practically does not aﬀect Qzz due to the small values of hρ2i. The values of Qzz
decrease in this region for all the states considered with exception of the state 1s ↓ 2p0 ↓ 2p−1 ↓. This decrease of
Qzz is associated with the decreasing value of hz2i due to an increasing one-particle binding energy. For the states
1s22p−1 and 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓ all these binding energies become inﬁnite for inﬁnite strong ﬁelds. This results in
Qzz → 0 as γ → ∞. For the other states presented in Figure 6 at least one of the single-electron energies remains
ﬁnite as γ → ∞ and, in result, Qzz has a ﬁnite limit as γ → ∞.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have applied our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method to a magnetized Li atom. The method is ﬂexible enough
to yield precise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths and our calculations for the ground and several excited states
are performed for magnetic ﬁeld strengths ranging from zero up to 2.3505 · 108T (γ = 1000). Our consideration
was focused on the ground state of the Li atom. With increasing ﬁeld strength this state undergoes two transitions
involving three diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations. For weak ﬁelds up to γ = 0.17633 the ground state arises from
the ﬁeld-free 1s22s conﬁguration. For intermediate ﬁelds (0.17633 < γ < 2.1530) the ground state is constituted by
the 1s22p−1 conﬁguration and for γ > 2.1530 the ground state conﬁguration is the fully spin-polarized 1s2p−13d−2
conﬁguration. We provide arguments which show that this conﬁguration must correspond to the ground state in
the strong ﬁeld limit. Generalizing these arguments we could derive the high-ﬁeld ground state conﬁguration of
arbitrary fully spin polarized atoms which are constituted by certain tightly bound hydrogen-like states. For example
for atoms with six electrons (i.e. C and C-like ions) the high-ﬁeld ground state is given by the fully spin polarized
1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓ 3d−2 ↓ 4f−3 ↓ 5g−4 ↓ 6h−5 ↓ conﬁguration.

We have also calculated HF energies for the two Li+ ground state conﬁgurations 1s2 and 1s ↓ 2p−1 ↓. The ﬁrst
of them forms the ground state at 0 ≤ γ < 2.071814, the second one is the high-ﬁeld ground state conﬁguration for
γ > 2.071814. These calculations allowed us to obtain the Li atom ground state ionization energy EI dependent on
the magnetic ﬁeld strength. This dependence, opposite to the analogous dependence for the total and binding energies
is not monotoneous and contains both areas of increasing values of EI and a domain of decreasing behaviour between
γ = 2.071814 and γ = 2.1530. Furthermore we have studied the quadrupole moment of the atom and show how its
complicated behaviour with changing ﬁeld strength can be explained through the ﬁeld dependence of the diﬀerent HF
orbitals.

Two remarks are in order. Our HF results do not include the eﬀects of correlation. To take into account the latter
would require a multiconﬁgurational approach which goes beyond the scope of the present paper. We, however, do
not expect that the correlation energy changes our main conclusions like, for example, the transitions in the ground

states conﬁgurations or the behaviour of the ionization energies depending on the ﬁeld strength. With increasing ﬁeld
strength the eﬀective one particle picture should be an increasingly better description of the wave function and the
percentage of the correlation energy should therefore decrease. For the case of hydrogen it is well-known that in the
high ﬁeld regime (γ >> 102) mass correction terms due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass become relevant i.e. are no more
negligible in comparison with the Coulomb binding energies. The most important mass corrections can be included
by replacing the electron mass through its reduced mass and results from the inﬁnite nuclear mass calculations are
related to those with the reduced mass via a scaling relation. In the case of the much heavier Li atom these eﬀects
are expected to be much smaller.

Apart from the Li atom other species i.e. three-electron objects are expected to be in particular of astrophysical

6

interest: the three-electron ions formed by the nuclei He, C, O, and Ne possess a high abundance in the universe. To
study these systems is the subject of a separate investigation.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Total energies of the Li atom as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength (solid lines marked by centered
symbols). Dotted lines are energies of two electronic conﬁgurations of the Li+ ion: (a) low-ﬁeld ground state 1s2; (b)
high-ﬁeld ground state 1s2p−1.

Figure 2. The same as in ﬁgure 1 in the relevant regime of transitions of the ground state conﬁgurations.
Figure 3. Contour plots of the total electronic densities for the ground state of the Li atom. The densities for

neighbouring lines are diﬀerent by a factor of e.

Figure 4. Binding energies of various states of the Li atom as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Figure 5. Li atom ground state ionization energy EI for a broad range of ﬁeld strengths. Transition points are
marked by broken vertical lines. The ﬁrst transition (from left to right) corresponds to the change of the ground
state conﬁguration from 1s22s to 1s22p−1. The second transition corresponds to the change of the Li+ ground state
conﬁguration from 1s2 to 1s2p−1. Third transition of the Li ground state conﬁguration from 1s22p−1 to 1s2p−13d−2.

Figure 6. Quadrupole moment of the Li atom depending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

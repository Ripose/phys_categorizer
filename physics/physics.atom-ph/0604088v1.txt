We have analyzed the statistical distribution of the ﬂuorescence signal levels in a magneto-optical
trap containing a few atoms and observed that it strongly depends on the relative size of the bin time
with respect to the trap decay time. We derived analytic expressions for the signal distributions
in two limiting cases, long and short bin time limits, and found good agreement with numerical
simulations performed regardless of the size of the bin time. We found an optimal size of the bin time
for minimizing the probability of indeterminate atom numbers while providing accurate information
on the instantaneous number of atoms in the trap. These theoretical results are compared with actual
experimental data. We observed super-Poisson counting statistics for the ﬂuorescence from trapped
atoms, which might be attributed to uncorrelated motion of trapped atoms in the inhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld in the trap.

INTRODUCTION

One of the long-sought experimental capabilities in
modern atomic physics and quantum optics is the ability
to load a single atom in a microscopic volume for an ex-
tended time and to manipulate and probe its internal and
external states at will.
In recent years, several groups
have developed technics for trapping and controlling a
single or a few neutral atoms based on tightly localized
magneto-optical traps or dipole traps [1, 2, 3, 4]. Sin-
gle or a-few-atom traps have been applied to wide range
of ﬁelds such as cavity quantum electrodynamics studies
[5], experiments on single-photon generation on demand
[6], and even archeological dating of ancient aquifers [7].
The most distinctive signature of single atom trapping
is the quantized ﬂuorescence signal. When the number of
trapped atoms is decreased to single-atom level, the ﬂu-
orescence signal from atoms exhibits stepwise underlying
variation in time and the size of the ﬂuorescence signal
with respect to a background level is interpreted as be-
ing proportional to the instantaneous number of atoms
in the trap. Such stepwise ﬂuorescence signals have been
regarded as the most deﬁnitive evidence for single atom
trapping. With this understanding, one can obtain the
atom-number distribution in the trap from the histogram
of the ﬂuorescence signal levels and can also identify indi-
vidual loading and loss events of atoms in the trap [4, 8].
In actual single-atom trap experiments, since the ﬂuo-
rescence signal from a single atom is extremely weak, one
needs to choose a bin time for photon counting as long as
possible in order to achieve enough signal to noise ratio.
If the bin time is too long, however, the atom number
can change several times during the bin time and thus
the observed ﬂuorescence no longer provides accurate in-
formation on the instantaneous atom number.

From the experimental point of view, therefore, sev-
eral questions naturally arise regarding the conditions
under which the ﬂuorescence measurement should be per-
formed: what will be the optimal size for the bin time,
what determines the shape of the signal distribution and
thus what information one can get from the observed sig-
nal distribution. The purpose of this paper is to answer
these questions.

This paper is organized in the following way. In Chap.
II we deﬁne the problem and derive analytic expressions
for the signal distributions in two limiting cases, long
and short bin time limits, along with signal-to-noise con-
siderations. These results are compared with numeri-
cal simulations in Chap. III, where an iterative method
and Monte Carlo simulations are employed to calculate
steady-state atom number distribution functions and the
signal distributions regardless of the size of the bin time.
In Chap. IV, an optimal size of the bin time is identi-
ﬁed for minimizing the probability of indeterminate atom
numbers while providing accurate information on the in-
stantaneous number of atoms in the trap. The analytic
expressions and numerical results are then compared with
experimental results in Chap. V. It is demonstrated that
the experimental signal distribution is well ﬁt by our the-
oretical model and from observed signal distributions one
can extract information not only on the number of atoms
but also on the state of atoms in the trap. In Chap. VI,
we summarize our ﬁndings and draw conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATION

In a few-atom trap, the ﬂuorescence signal from atoms,
induced by a probe laser or by a weak trap laser itself in
the case of a magneto-optic trap (MOT), is proportional
to the number of atoms in the trap. The ﬂuorescence sig-
nal is measured with a photodetector, usually in photon
counting mode with photon counting electronics. Sup-
pose the signal counts are successively taken in time for

a preset bin time of ∆t. The signal counts Si measured
in ith time bin, speciﬁed as ti < t < ti+1 with ti ≡
i∆t
(i = 0, 1, 2, . . .), can be written as

Si =

Z

ti+∆t

(1)

where N (t) is the instantaneous number of atoms in the
trap (N (t) = 0, 1, 2, . . .), aj(t) is the counting rate of ﬂu-
orescence from jth atom, and b(t) is the counting rate of
background signal such as detector dark counts and scat-
tered laser light or stray room light. The bin time ∆t is
assumed to be much larger than spontaneous emission
lifetime of atoms, typically tens of nanoseconds. The sig-
nal Si is truncated to the nearest integer by the counting
electronics.

The instantaneous number of atoms N (t) rapidly ﬂuc-
tuates due to various stochastic processes. Temporal
change of its probability distribution function PN (t) is
governed by the following master equation:

where N = 0, 1, 2, . . . with P−1 = 0, R is loading rate
of atoms into the trap, Γ1 is the one-atom loss rate due
to collisions with background gas, Γ2 is the two-atom
loss rate due to light-assisted intra-trap collisions [8].
The master equation Eq.(2) cannot be solved analyti-
cally. However, for a microscopic trap with only a few
atoms in a volume of a few micron in diameter, the two-
atom loss terms proportional to Γ2 are negligibly small,
and thus approximate expressions for PN and the num-
it can be obtained
ber correlation function
N (t)N (t + τ )
[9] with
h it denoting a time average. For now, we just
neglect the two-atom loss terms. The analysis including
these terms will be discussed later.

Without the Γ2 terms, the master equation Eq.(2) be-
comes the same as the simple birth-death model of popu-
lation [10], yielding a Poisson distribution in steady state
with a mean value ¯N = R/Γ1 and a variance σ2 = ¯N .
For a few-atom trap with N
1, the correlation decay
time τ of the number correlation function is given by
τ = 1/Γ1 and is the measure of the average time dur-
ing which N (t) remains constant [3]. When Γ2 terms
are not negligible, the correlation decay time is a compli-
cate function of R, Γ1 and Γ2 and always smaller than
1/Γ1 due to the additional two-atom loss process [9]. We
denote the correlation decay time in this case as τeﬀ in
order to distinguish it from the above deﬁnition of τ for
the Γ2 = 0 case. The correlation decay time is also called
the trap decay time for macroscopic traps.

The signal distribution shows much diﬀerent behaviors
depending on the size of ∆t with respect to τ . For an-
alytic analysis we consider two limiting cases, long bin

time (∆t
τ ), as illus-
trated in Fig. 1. In the long bin time limit, there exist
many loading and loss events in a single bin time whereas
the atom number hardly changes during the bin time in
the short bin time limit, and thus these two limiting cases
lead to quite diﬀerent signal distributions.

Assume that N

b(t) ﬂuctuate much faster than τ . Under this assumption,
for a given N the variations in aj∆t and b∆t go like
square root of those, respectively, and thus much smaller
than aj∆t and b∆t themselves. On the other hand, the
variation due to N change is as large as aj∆t. Therefore,
in evaluating the integral in Eq. (1), we can neglect the
ﬂuctuations in aj and b and replace them with their mean
values ¯a and ¯b, respectively.

In general, the statistics of Aj,i and Bi, with associated
distribution functions Pa(Aj,i) and Pb(Bi), respectively,
are not necessarily Poissonian. However, in many cases
these quantities follow Poisson statistics. For example,
although the photon statistics of resonance ﬂuorescence
of a small number of atoms is sub-Poissonian, when mea-
sured with an imperfect photodector, the counting statis-
tics become Poissonian.
In addition, statistics of scat-
tered light of laser beam is Poissonian. Of course, there
are cases where these statistics become super-Poissonian,
particularly when laser power ﬂuctuations and other
technical noises enter. For now, we just assume both
Aj,i and Bi follow Poisson statistics with mean values

The resulting distribution is just a Poisson distribution

non-Poisson distributions for Pa(Aj,i) and Pb(Bi), the
resulting P (Si|

a well-localized Gaussian-like distribution with a mean
value ¯Sm, but its variance is no longer equal to ¯Sm (c.f.

respectively, and thereby results in signiﬁcant overlap be-
tween adjacent peaks for m

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In the preceding chapters, we argued that the two-
atom loss terms in the master equation are negligibly
small for a few-atom trap with a few-micron in size and
thus the atom number distribution function is approxi-
mately Poissonian. When the number of atoms in such
microscopic trap is increased with its size ﬁxed, the two-
atom loss processes take place more frequently. As a re-
sult, the atom-number distribution deviates signiﬁcantly
from a Poissonian distribution and thus the Poisson ap-
proximation in the preceding chapters are no longer ap-
plicable. In this chapter, we include the two-atom loss
term and calculate distribution functions numerically.

Although the master equation, Eq. (2), cannot be
solved analytically, a steady-state solution can be found
numerically. In steady state, we have dPN /dt = 0 and
by rearranging terms we obtain the following recursion
relation with P−1 = 0.

RPN =

(N + 1)(2Γ1 + N Γ2)PN +1

be easily calculated by iterative method. Alternatively,
one can calculate a ﬂuctuating time sequence of Si in
steady state by simulating loading and one- and two-
atom losses and simulating ﬂuctuating aj(t) and b(t) in
Monte Carlo simulation. From the time sequence, one
can calculate the histogram of atom number, i.e., the
steady-state atom-number distribution.

We compare the results of these two numerical meth-
ods in Fig. 4. The values of R, Γ1 and Γ2 used in the
calculations were derived from the experimental data of
Ref. [9]. A Poisson distribution with the same R and
Γ1 is also shown in Fig. 4 (by ﬁlled circle-line) for com-
parison. Once P (N ) is known, we can calculate the
mean atom number ¯N and variance σ2. The results are
¯N = 1.6 and σ2 = 1.5, which should be compared with
¯N = σ2 = R/Γ1 = 1.9 obtained for Γ2 = 0. With
inclusion of Γ2 term, the mean atom number decreases
because of the additional loss term. Although the distri-
bution is not Poissonian, the deviation from a Poissonian
distribution with the same ¯N value is negligibly small.
According to Ref.[9], the correlation function which in-
cludes the two atom loss term can be approximated by
the functional form for Poisson case as in Eq. (7) with τ
replaced with an eﬀective correlation decay time τeﬀ .

τeﬀ = 1/Γeﬀ = 4/[Γ1 + 3

Γ2

1 + 4RΓ2]

q

For the above parameters, τeﬀ =18 sec, compared to τ =
Γ−1

1 =23 sec.
This observation allows us to use Eqs.(5) and (10) for
the calculation of P (Ni) and P (Si), respectively, with
the ¯N and τeﬀ values obtained above for nonzero Γ2.

≪

For ∆t
τ limit, we can calculate P (Si) distribution
by using Eq. (19) with substitution of the exact PN =m
obtained numerically. In Fig. 5 the solid lines are given
by Eqs. (10) and (19) and the ﬁlled area is by the Monte
Carlo simulation.

The signal distribution P (Si) in the intermediate re-
gion, other than two limiting cases considered above, can
only be obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. From the
time sequence of Si calculated by means of the Monte
Carlo simulation with the aforementioned parameters, we
can calculate P (Si) for various ∆t/τ by combining Si val-
ues in neighboring time bins. The results are summarized
in Fig. 6. For ∆t/τ
1, individual atom-number peaks
are well separated and resolved as shown in Fig. 6(b) as
long as ∆t/τ ≫ 4/(¯aτ ). Otherwise, the peaks for large
m overlap with neighboring peaks signiﬁcantly as shown
in Fig. 6(a). As the ratio ∆t/τ increases, the broad back-
ground appears and grows in height as in Fig. 6(c) until
the background outgrows the atom-number peaks com-
pletely as in Fig. 6(d).

≪

IV. OPTIMAL BIN TIME

The trend observed in Fig. 6 can be formulated in a
quantitative way. We have observed for ∆t
τ that
individual signal distributions signiﬁcantly overlap with
neighboring peaks (due to poor signal-to-noise ratio) un-
less ∆t is much greater than 4/¯a. The overlap of distri-
bution functions leads to an increase in the probability
of having indeterminate atom numbers. We can quan-
tify this probability P< as a sum of all areas outside the
η ¯A < Si < ¯Sm + η ¯A around the
boundaries set by ¯Sm −
mth peak with η < 0.5. From Eq. (19) we obtain

The atom number also becomes indeterminate if it
changes during the bin time as in the case of ∆t

From the master equation, Eq. (2), it can be seen that
the total rate of change Γtot of the atom number is given
by

If the atom number changes during the bin time ∆t, the
atom number cannot be determined unambiguously from
the signal level for this particular bin time. Therefore,
P>(∆t) can be regarded as the total probability of inde-
terminate atom numbers for ∆t & τ .

In general, the above two processes occur indepen-
dently and thus can occur simultaneous during ∆t.
Therefore, the total probability of indeterminate atom
numbers for arbitrary ∆t is given by

Ptot(∆t) = P>(∆t) + P<(∆t)

P>(∆t)

P<(∆t).

In Fig. 8(a), this probability Ptot(∆t) is plotted as the
ratio ∆t/τ for several η values. Symbols represent the
results of Monte-Carlo simulations. The bin time ∆t that
minimizes this probability can be regarded as an optimal
bin time for accurate measurement of the instantaneous
atom numbers in a few-atom trap. The optimal ∆t/τ
value is plotted as a function of η in Fig. 8(b). It can be
seen that for 0.2 < η < 0.4 the optimal bin time is within
the range of 0.003 < ∆t/τ < 0.008. Particularly, for
η = 0.3, we have an optimal bin time of ∆t/τ = 0.004 for
the same parameter values as used in Figs. 2–6. Among
the plots in Fig. 6, plot (b) is the most closest to the case
of the optimal bin time.

V. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL
DATA

Detailed information on our experiment can be found
elsewhere [4, 9].
In short, a few rubidium atoms were
trapped in a microscopic MOT with a diameter of a few
microns and ﬂuorescence induced by a trap laser was
measured in photon counting mode. A raw experimental
data, a segment of which is shown in Fig. 9(a), was taken
with a bin time of 0.20 sec. The atom-number correla-
tion time τ was measured to be 23 sec, resulting in ∆t/τ
of 0.0043, which is the value used in Figs. 5(b) and 6(b).
Distributions with larger values of ∆t/τ are derived from
the raw data by combining counts in neighboring time
bins.

We pay close attention to Fig. 9(b), where the ﬁt is
given by Eq. (19) with each P (Si|
m) given by a Gaussian
distribution with a mean of ¯Sm = m ¯A+ ¯B and a variance
of σ2
m to be evaluated below.

The average background photon number, ¯B = ¯b∆t,
and the average level spacing, ¯A = ¯a∆t, are 627 and 653,
respectively, obtained from the experiment. By counting
the individual loading and loss events in the time trace
of ﬂuorescence as shown in Fig. 9(a), one can measure
the loading rate R and the one- and two-atom loss rates
Γ1 and Γ2, respectively, and the results are R=0.080 s−1,
Γ1=0.043 s−1, Γ2=0.0056 s−1. The detailed information

The background counts are mostly due to scattered
light of trap and repump lasers of MOT. Due to long-
term power ﬂuctuations, the mean value of background
counts also ﬂuctuates, and as a result, the width of the
zero-atom peak in the signal distribution P (Si) becomes
larger than that of a Poissonian distribution. In fact, the
background variance σ2
B was measured to be 2820, about
4.5 times larger than the mean count ¯B.

If we assume that the ﬂuorescence counts follow Pois-

son statistics, the variance σ2

m can be modeled as

m = σ2

where σ2
A is the variances of one-atom ﬂuorescence, and
it is assume that the ﬂuorescence from one atom is statis-
tically independent from that of another atom. However,
as shown in Fig. 9(c), the observed variances of individual
peaks are not well ﬁt by the the above formula. Rather
they are well ﬁt by an empirical formula given by

the slope of which is about four times larger than that of
Eq. (29).

The fact that the variance is still linear in m indicates
that the ﬂuorescence from one atom is still statistically
independent from that of another atom. This observation
excludes, as a source of the increased variance, the ﬂuo-
rescence dispersion due to power ﬂuctuation of trap and
probe lasers, mechanical vibrations and similar technical

Poisson distribution for this actual ¯N is used for PN =m

in the signals of individual atoms and thus proportional
to m2.

One possible reason for this increase variance is the
motional eﬀect of individual atoms. The atoms move
independently from each other inside the MOT. Due to
the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, atoms expe-
rience diﬀerent Zeeman shifts and thus their upper level
populations vary in time diﬀerently and independently
from one atom to another. This variation can give rise
to the observed increased variance in ﬂuorescence counts.

VI. CONCLUSION

In the limit of ∆t

We have derived analytic expressions for signal distri-
bution P (Si) of ﬂuorescence photo-counts from a few-
atom MOT and compared the results with Monte Carlo
simulations and experimental data. The signal distri-
bution strongly depends on the relative size of the bin
time ∆t of photon counting with respect to the trap de-
cay time τ .
τ , the distribution
shows multiple peaks with the integrated areas of indi-
vidual peaks constituting the atom-number distribution
function PN . Conversely, the stepwise ﬂuorescence sig-
nal corresponding to a multi-peak distribution can be
regarded as a deﬁnitive evidence of a few atoms in the
trap. As ∆t
τ is increased, a broad background ap-
pears and eventually outgrows sharp peaks corresponding
to atom numbers and turns into a single peak in the limit

of ∆t
τ . The validity of our derivation was conﬁrmed
by comparing the results with those of numerical simula-
tions including Monte Carlo simulation. These theoreti-
cal results were then compared with experimental results.
Fluorescence photo-count distributions were observed to
be super-Poissonian, the origin of which appears to be
the statistically independent motion of atoms in the in-
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of MOT. Our results provide
necessary theoretical background for analyzing and inter-
preting the ﬂuorescence signal of a few atom MOT and
also clarify the optimum condition on the bin time in
actual experiments.

Ionization of a Model Atom: Exact Results and Connection with Experiment

for times of order Γ

We prove that a model atom having one bound state will be fully ionized by a time periodic
potential of arbitrary strength r and frequency ω. The survival probability is for small r given by
−Γt
, where n is the number of “photons” required for ionization,
e
−3. Results are for a 1d
with enhanced stability at resonances. For late times the decay is like t
system with a delta function potential of strength −g(1 + η(t)) but comparison with experiments on
the microwave ionization of excited hydrogen atoms and with recent analytical work indicate that
many features are universal.

Transitions between bound and free states of a system
are of great importance in many areas of science [1] and
“much of the practical business of quantum mechanics
is calculating exponential decay rates” [2]. There are,
however, still many unresolved questions when one goes
beyond perturbation theory [1]– [7]. Unfortunately, ap-
proaches going beyond perturbation theory such as Flo-
quet theory, semi-classical analysis and numerical solu-
tion of the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation are both
complicated and also involve, when calculating transi-
tions to the continuum, uncontrolled approximations [1]–
[6].
It is only recently that some general results going
beyond perturbation theory have been rigorously estab-
lished for models with spatial structure [7]. We still don’t
know, however, many basic facts about the ionization
process, e.g. the conditions for a time dependent exter-
nal ﬁeld to fully dissociate a molecule or ionize an atom,
much less the ionization probability as a function of time
and of the form of such a ﬁeld [8]. Granted that the prob-
lem is intrinsically complicated it would be very valuable
to have some simple solvable models which contain the
spatial structure of the bound state and the continuum
and can thus serve as a guide to the essential features of
the process.

In this note we describe new exact results relating to
ionization of a very simple model atom by an oscillat-
ing ﬁeld (potential) of arbitrary strength and frequency.
While our results hold for arbitrary strength perturba-
tions, the predictions are particularly explicit and sharp
in the case where the strength of the oscillating ﬁeld is
small relative to the binding potential—a situation com-
monly encountered in practice. Going beyond perturba-
tion theory we rigorously prove the existence of a well
deﬁned exponential decay regime which is followed, for
late times when the survival probability is already very
low, by a power law decay. This is true no matter how
small the frequency. The times required for ionization
are however very dependent on the perturbing frequency.
For a harmonic perturbation with frequency ω the log-
2n, where r
arithm of the ionization time grows like r−
is the normalized strength of the perturbation and n is

the number of “photons” required for ionization. This
is consistent with conclusions drawn from perturbation
theory and other methods (the approach in [6] being the
closest to ours), but is, as far as we know, the ﬁrst exact
result in this direction. We also obtain, via controlled
schemes, such as continued fractions and convergent se-
ries expansions, results for strong perturbing potentials.
Quite surprisingly our results reproduce many features
of the experimental curves for the multiphoton ionization
of excited hydrogen atoms by a microwave ﬁeld [3]. These
features include both the general dependence of the ion-
ization probabilities on ﬁeld strength as well as the in-
n¯hω, n
crease in the life time of the bound state when
integer, is very close to the binding energy. Such “reso-
nance stabilization” is a striking feature of the Rydberg
level ionization curves [3]. These successes and compar-
isons with analytical results [1]- [8] suggest that the sim-
ple model we shall now describe contains many of the
essential ingredients of the ionization process in real sys-
tems.

This in turn implies that

behavior of the solutions of the homogeneous equation
associated to (7): y(p) has poles on a vertical line if the
homogeneous equation has a solution that is uniformly
bounded along that line. The absence of such solutions
in the closed right half plane is shown by exploiting the
symmetry with respect to complex conjugation of the
underlying physical problem and carries through directly
to the more general periodic potential (6).

To understand the ionization processes as a function of
t, ω, and r requires a detailed study of the singularities
of y(p) in the whole complex p-plane. This yields the
following results: For small r, y(p) has square root branch

order in r, corresponding to letting ω approach the res-

the bound state against ionization by perturbations with
such frequencies. The origin of this behavior is, in our
model, the vanishing of the matrix element in (10) at
k = 0. This behavior should hold quite generally since

32 to 90. The experimental results in Fig. 3 are taken

The plot there is thus of n4

results of our model with the experimental ones we had
to relate r to n4

drogen atom Hamiltonian with potential V0(R) =
1/R
perturbed by a polarized electric ﬁeld V1 = xF sin(ωt),
and our model with V1 = rV0, this is clearly not some-
thing that can be done in any unique way. We therefore
simply tried to ﬁnd a correspondence between n4
0F and
r which would give the best visual ﬁt. Somewhat to our
surprise these ﬁts for diﬀerent values of ω/ω0 all turned
out to have values of r close to 3n4
0F . A correspondence
of the same order of magnitude is obtained by comparing
the perturbation-induced shifts of bound state energies in
our model and in Hydrogen.

The degree of agreement between the behavior of what
might be considered as the absolutely simplest quantum
mechanical model of a bound state coupled to the con-
tinuum and experiments on hydrogen atoms is truly sur-
prising. The experimental results and in particular the
resonances have often been interpreted in terms of clas-
sical phase space orbits in which resonance stabilization
is due to KAM–like stability islands [3]. Such classical
analogs are absent in our model as in fact are “photons”.
On the other hand, the special nature of the edge of the
continuum seems to be quite general, cf. [6].

tions would extend to a similarly general setting. We are
currently investigating various extensions of our model
to understand the eﬀect of the restriction to one bound
state. This will hopefully lead to a more detailed under-
standing, and some control over the ionization process.

Because Γ relates to the position of the poles of the

matical rigor aside), if r is not too large, is the following,

which is eﬀectively the Borel summation of the formal

proven in [7] for three dimensional models with quite gen-

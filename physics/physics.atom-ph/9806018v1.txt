anisotropy.

This paper investigates the possibility of suppressing the ionization rate in a magnetostatic trap of
metastable neon atoms by spin-polarizing the atoms. Suppression of the ionization is critical for the
possibility of reaching Bose-Einstein condensation with such atoms. We estimate the relevant long-
range interactions for the system, consisting of electric quadrupole-quadrupole and dipole-induced
dipole terms, and develop short-range potentials based on the Na2 singlet and triplet potentials.
The auto-ionization widths of the system are also calculated. With these ingredients we calculate
the ionization rate for spin-polarized and for spin-isotropic samples, caused by anisotropy of the
long-range interactions. We ﬁnd that spin-polarization may allow for four orders of magnitude
suppression of the ionization rate for Ne. The results depend sensitively on a precise knowledge of
the interaction potentials, however, pointing out the need for experimental input. The same model
gives a suppression ratio close to unity for metastable xenon in accordance with experimental results,
due to a much increased anisotropy in this case.

I. INTRODUCTION

The experimental observation of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in 1995 by three diﬀerent groups [1–3] has
fueled renewed interest in this subject, with many more groups trying to achieve the conditions under which the
BEC-transition occurs. Stated simply, one has to reach the point where the nearest-neighbor distance between the
atoms is of the same order of magnitude as their de Broglie-wavelength Λ. In mathematical terms, the condition to
fulﬁll is [4]

with n the atomic number density. Experimentally, this can be achieved by evaporative cooling of atoms caught in a
1014 atoms/cm3 [1] for
trap, with typical ﬁnal conditions given by a temperature of Tc ≈
Na, and Tc ≈
×
Both the eﬃciency of the cooling process and the ﬁnal density achievable depend on the rates of inelastic and
elastic collisions in the ultra-cold atom clouds used [5]. With alkali atoms, inelastic loss in binary collisions between
ground-state atoms is due mostly to hyperﬁne-changing collisions, with rates on the order of 10−15cm3/s for Rb [6,7].
These rates are generallly low enough to allow condition (1) to be reached [8]. In addition, all the alkali atoms have
closed optical transitions from the ground state that are accessible with commercially available lasers, allowing for
initial trapping and cooling in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) [9]. As a result, BEC has now been achieved in Na, Rb
and Li, while work is in progress on K and Cs.

In comparison, the properties of rare gas atoms [10] seem less promising. As with atomic hydrogen, laser cooling
and trapping starting from the ground state is not practical due to the very short wavelengths required (75 nm for
neon). All rare gas atoms have a metastable ﬁrst excited state, however, that does allow for optical manipulation.

For He, this is the
state, while for Ne (n=2) through Xe (n=5) the appropriate state can be written

(np)5 (n+1)s 3P2}
. Condensates of such atoms might show interesting new phenomena related to the available
{
electronic energy, such as collective decay or ionization. In addition, an “atom laser” [11] based on such condensates
may ﬁnd applications that are not covered by alkali atoms: because of the large internal energy of metastable rare
gas atoms, one might make the comparison with the high-energy photons of an XUV optical laser as opposed to those
from a HeNe-laser. On the downside, this internal energy of metastable rare gas atoms is always enough to allow for
ionization in binary collisions [12]. Consequently, ionization becomes a major loss process in metastable atom traps,
10−11cm3/s for He(23S) [13]. Such high rates make achieving
with experimental rates reported to be as large as 5
condition (1) impractical using the techniques currently employed for alkali atoms.

×

For He, Shlyapnikov and co-workers [14,15] have shown, however, that the ionization rate can be very strongly

suppressed by spin-polarizing the atoms. In the process

the initial state then has total electron spin S = 2, while in the ﬁnal state spin can only be S = 0,1. Because the
ionization process conserves electron spin, ionization is prohibited in the S = 2 (quintet) states and can proceed
only after a magnetic interaction between the electrons causes a spin-ﬂip during a binary encounter. Shlyapnikov
and co-workers [14,15] found that at ultra-cold temperatures the relatively weak spin-dipole or magnetic spin-spin
interaction then limits the ionization rate in spin-polarized metastable He samples to the order of 10−14 cm3/s [14,15].
For the heavier rare gases Ne through Xe, the spin-conservation rule holds also. Therefore, suppression of ionization
by spin-polarization should be feasible as well. An added complication, however, is the fact that the unﬁlled (np)5
core now has p-character, as opposed to the He case, where it has s-character. This causes an orientation dependence
of the electrostatic interaction potentials that is present even at large internuclear separation. During a collision, this
causes the (np)5 cores to reorient, which, through the spin-orbit interaction, induces electron spin-ﬂips. Since this
interaction has an electrostatic origin rather than the magnetic one that causes spin-ﬂips in metastable He collisions,
one may expect it to have a much larger inﬂuence and possibly limit the ionization rate for spin-polarized samples to
much larger values than for He. It is the purpose of this paper to estimate these eﬀects for trapped clouds of atoms.
Out of the various metastable rare gases, we concentrate on metastable neon because this element is being used in
experiments presently going on in our laboratory [16]. In addition, the properties necessary for our calculations are
most readily available for this species [17]. While for most alkali atoms, the properties of the atom-atom interactions
are known quite accurately [18], the situation is very diﬀerent for the metastable rare gases, so that we have to make
our own estimates.

II. METASTABLE NEON IONIZATION RATES.

(np)5(n+1)s

{

The

-conﬁguration of any of the heavy metastable rare gases contains four energy levels, with the
}
3P2-state always the lowest-lying state. Table I lists the properties of these states in neon. The four atomic ﬁne-
structure states give rise to a total of 144 molecular states. In what follows we will concentrate on the 25 states that
connect asymptotically to Ne(3P2)+ Ne(3P2), since the 3P2 state is the only state that is both metastable and has
non-zero angular momentum, thus allowing for magnetic trapping and spin-polarization.

In the following sections we develop auto-ionization widths, short-range and long-range real potentials for the
equivalent process of Eq. (2) for Ne(3P2). We then use them in a standard coupled-channels calculation [19] of
the scattering matrix
. For each (positive) initial kinetic energy, we express the asymptotic solution matrix of
the calculation as a linear combination of Bessel and Neumann functions for the radial part, multiplied by channel
functions Ψk denoting electronic and angular momentum states. For Ψk we have used states with well-deﬁned total
angular momentum quantum number P with projection M onto a laboratory axis, rotational quantum number ℓ,
electronic (molecular) angular momentum quantum number j and parity Π, denoted as

S

Since Π, P and M are conserved in a collision, this has the advantage that the coupled equations can be separated
into blocks characterized by these quantum numbers, which can then be solved separately. The
-matrix for such a
block will be denoted SΠP M . The spin-polarized and non-polarized channels can be easily identiﬁed because all the
non-ionizing, quintet states have j = 4 exclusively.

S

For any given parity, only even ℓ (Π = 1) or odd ℓ (Π =

1) contribute. Because the Ne(3P2)-atoms we are dealing
−
with are bosons, in addition only states that are symmetric under the exchange of two atoms can contribute. This
translates into the rule that ℓ + j must be even. Since parity is conserved in a collision, it follows that the non-ionizing
quintet states (j = 4) can only couple to other even j = 0,2 states.

Because of the presence of ionization, the

-matrix for (in)elastic scattering is not unitary. Ionization rates follow
from the loss of ﬂux described by this property. For the case of a trapped cloud of atoms, the distribution of the
direction of the initial relative velocity of two atoms is spatially isotropic. Taking this into account, we ﬁnd for the
ionization rate K pol in a polarized atom sample

minimum values of C5 that occur in the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2) subset are 0.47 a.u. and -0.37 a.u., respectively. These
values will increase when going to the heavier rare gases Ar, Kr and Xe, in accordance with the increasing value of
-matrix element, which we have listed in Table III (taken from Ref. [23]). According to the Table, for Xe the
the
QQ-term will be about 26 times larger than for Ne.

To obtain an estimate of the DD-term, we have used a second-order perturbation treatment of the DD-interaction

can be understood from a semi-classical description of the DD-interaction, where the polarizability of a Ne atom is

thought to be made up of a combination of a large, spatially isotropic value dv ≈

when going to heavier rare gases, ﬁnally attaining 1.3 % for Xe (see Tables II and III). For He, Eq. (12) is still
appropriate for the limiting value dc = 0.

Table II lists the properties of the 25 molecular eigenstates that diagonalize the combination of the DD- and QQ-

average, the QQ-term is quite a small eﬀect. For one it is overwhelmed by the DD-term out to internuclear distances
of R
4000 a.u. Beyond that point, its value is considerably less than 1 pK, far below the collision energy currently
obtainable in atom traps. Therefore, the low-energy behavior of the the scattering rates will be determined by the
DD-term. Since, however, the anisotropy due to the QQ-term (1 a.u. /R5) is of the same order of magnitude as the
QQ-term itself, while that due to the DD-term (4.5 a.u. /R6) is only a fraction of its average value, the QQ term
should still be expected to determine the absolute value of the ionization rates for spin-polarized atoms, which are
governed by inelastic, spin-changing processes.

IV. SHORT-RANGE POTENTIALS

As mentioned in the introduction, there is little information available about the interaction potentials of the heavier
metastable rare gases. We can obtain rough estimates of these, however, by considering the analogy with ground-state

From this we can construct Ne2 potentials if we multiply VNa by a unit core-factor that is diagonal in all core quantum
numbers. Such potentials should contain the essential features of the valence-electron exchange interactions, but do
not describe the interaction of the core hole of one atom with the valence electron of the other. Since the radius of
the valence electron’s orbital is considerably larger than that of the core-electrons [30], this approximation should be
reasonable. Also, core-valence electron terms can be added in a semi-empirical way. For an accurate description of
the wells and turning points, however, either ab-initio potentials or experimental data would be required.

All states conform to Hund’s case (c) [31], and in addition can be characterized by their total angular momentum

deepest well, of symmetry 0+
g , does not coincide with the Na2(1Σ+

deeper wells to occur, the spin-orbit coupling of each of the Ne atoms must be allowed to compete with the Na2(1Σ+

V. AUTO-IONIZATION WIDTHS

In scattering calculations, ionization can be introduced by adding an imaginary part to the real-valued atomic

interaction potentials [12,32], creating a complex “optical” potential W ,

W (R) = V (R)

iΓ(R)/2,

with Γ(R) the so-called auto-ionization width.

Op de Beek et al. [33,34] have described a numerical method for the calculation of Γ(R), based on a recurrence
recipe developed by Rico et al. [35]. Brieﬂy, one calculates matrix elements between initial and ﬁnal states of the
Coulomb interaction between the individual electrons involved in the ionization process. In the process considered
here,

the dominant ionization mechanism is the so-called exchange mechanism [36]. This means that the valence electron of
atom 1 transfers to the available core-state of atom 2, leaving the core of atom 1 to form a positive ion. The valence
electron of atom 2 is now no longer bound and leaves the scene.
In the basis of valence-electron and core-states
introduced in Eq. (13), a partial ionization amplitude γ may be deﬁned, given by

while the free electron’s wavefunction Ψf is given by a Coulomb wave, characterized by orbital angular momentum

By using the inverse of the expansion in Eq. (13) on atom 1 as well as atom 2, γ may be transformed into a
molecular basis. From the resulting molecular ionization amplitudes γmol, matrix elements of the ionization width

We have calculated all elements of Γ(R) relevant for the ionization process of Eq. (22), using electron wavefunctions
tabulated by Hausamann [22], and using a modiﬁed version of the computer code developed by Op de Beek et al.
[33,34]. Figure (2) displays the results in the same basis as used for Fig. (1), for internuclear distances 4 < R(a.u.) < 12.
As expected, the quintet states all have zero widths. Also as one would expect, the widths of the other states show
an approximately exponentially decreasing behavior with R. At each R, the ionization width is largest for the states
with the largest (S = 0)-component.

The calculations of Fig. (3) show that a strong suppression, η

104, is still possible notwithstanding the long-
range anisotropy of the potentials. The resulting suppressed ionization rate, K pol
10−15cm3/s at E = 1 µK,
would certainly allow one to reach the BEC transition, being comparable to the depolarization rate for Rb, K depol =
10−15cm3/s [6,7]. This result is largely due to the fact that the depolarization due to the long-range anisotropy
1
is counteracted strongly at short range by the separation of the non-ionizing quintet states from the other, ionizing
states [see Fig. (1)]. This is illustrated in Fig. (4), which displays the rates that result from artiﬁcially replacing the
Na2(1Σ+
u ) in the calculation of the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2)-potentials. In this case, no
170.
short-range separation between ionizing and non-ionizing states occurs, with the result that η is reduced to η
This shows that the short-range behavior of the potentials is very important for the amount of suppression achievable.
To investigate the relative importance of the quadrupole-quadrupole vs. the dipole-dipole interaction, we have
calculated the ionization rates for polarized and non-polarized samples, with and without the QQ-term in the long-
range potentials. Fig. (5) shows the results. From this ﬁgure, it becomes clear that the QQ-term is the dominating
inﬂuence on the ionization rate of spin-polarized samples, which change by about an order of magnitude when the
QQ-term is removed. At the same time, however, removing the quadrupole term has little inﬂuence on the threshold
behavior of the rates nor on the ionization rate for unpolarized samples, conﬁrming the dominating role of the dipole
term on the elastic scattering already anticipated in Sec. III.

≈

B. Inﬂuence of quasi-bound states.

Since the short-range potentials for the Ne-system are not well known, we have to consider variations of the ionization
rates due to the uncertainty in the potentials. Of particular importance are resonances due to quasi-bound states with
total energy equal to that of the ℓ = 0 quintet state. These can give rise to the formation of a relatively long-lived
collisional complex, in which the atoms undergo a number of vibrations before they exit. In such a case, the turning
point at small R, where ionization is most likely, may be encountered several times, leading to an enhanced ionization
probability. To investigate the importance of such resonances, we have added a Gaussian “bump” of variable height to
the bottom of the well of either the Na2(3Σ+

Figure (6) shows that a variation of the Na2(1Σ+

g ) singlet potential only has a small eﬀect on K pol. In this case,
only the energy levels in the quintet states are unaﬀected by the change in phase-content, since they derive solely from
the Na2(3Σ+
u ) triplet potential. We can conclude, therefore, that resonances in states other than the quintet states do
not seriously alter K pol. The most likely explanation for this is that such resonances are extremely wide, due to the
large ionization probability in the non-quintet states, and therefore correspondingly weak. In contrast, a variation of
u ) potential depth has a very large eﬀect on K pol, as found from Fig. (6). Here, atoms that initially have
the Na2(3Σ+
ℓ = 0 in the quintet, are coupled to an ℓ
= 0 quintet state at the same total energy, which has a centrifugal barrier at
R
75 a.u. Such a quasi-bound level may have a very sharp and therefore strong resonance, since in this state, too,
ionization is now prohibited. During its strongly enhanced lifetime, the molecule may therefore make many vibrations
before it tunnels through the barrier or is transferred back to the initial state. All the while, the anisotropy present in
the electrostatic interactions weakly couples the molecule to the ionizing states, leading to a greatly enhanced K pol.
In our calculations, K pol

These results clearly indicate the extreme importance of an accurate knowledge of the full potentials, or, equiv-
alently, the scattering lengths for the process under consideration. We expect that such information will only be

obtained reliably from an ab-initio theoretical treatment of the short-range potentials in combination with experimen-
tal spectroscopic determinations of the bound molecular states. Until now, this information has only been available
for some of the alkali atoms. Since all metastable rare gas atoms other than He have more than one bosonic isotope,
one may hope to avoid such resonances by an appropriate choice of isotope. Since there are a total of nine quintet
states, however, with as many as 5 diﬀerent potential curves if additional short-range interactions are considered,
there may be so many diﬀerent resonances that avoiding them altogether is impossible.

C. Variation with long-range anisotropy.

In order to make estimates of the suppression ratio for the heavier rare gases Ar through Xe, we have to study
the dependence of the ionization rates on long-range anisotropy. According to Table III, both the anisotropy in the
dipole-dipole term as well as that in the quadrupole-quadrupole term becomes progressively larger going from Ne to
Xe.

-Cmin

A convenient way of representing the variation in C5 is by introducing a parameter ∆C5 = Cmax

equal to
the diﬀerence of the C5 coeﬃcients of the most and least attractive long-range potentials. Table (II) gives ∆C5
= 0.84 a.u. for Ne, which may be considered its “nominal” value, which we will denote by ∆Cnom
. We can then
study the inﬂuence of long-range anisotropy by calculating the ionization rates as a function of ∆C5/∆Cnom
. Such
a calculation is shown in Fig. (8), where, for clarity, we have omitted any anisotropy in the DD-term by using an
identical, averaged C6-coeﬃcient for all states involved. The ﬁgure points to a quadratic dependence of K pol on the
dominating anisotropy, while K unpol is basically unaﬀected by the change in C5 . This result can be explained by
simple qualitative arguments. The anisotropic long-range interaction C5 /R5 will cause a rotation of the molecule’s
electronic angular momentum j over an angle that is proportional to the variation ∆C5 in C5 , as follows from the
equation of motion IdΩ/dt = τ for the classical rotation angle Ω of an object with a moment of inertia I acted upon
by a torque τ (for an anisotropic potential, τ is proportional to dV (R)/dΩ). In a binary collision of two polarized
proportional to ∆C5 on other, ionizing
atoms, by analogy the initially pure quintet state will develop a projection
states. Since the probability for ionization in such a collision will be proportional to
, we obtain the quadratic
i
dependence of K pol on ∆C5 found in Fig. (8).

From this ﬁgure we can therefore conclude that the limit on the suppression ratio set by long-range anisotropy
quickly becomes stricter as the rare gas becomes heavier, because ∆C5 is proportional to the square of the quadrupole
moment of the core (see Eq. (12)). We have listed the corresponding matrix elements in Table III for He through Xe,
based on values taken from Ref. [23], and indicated the relative anisotropies of all the rare gases in Fig. 8. For He,
∆C5 = 0 since only s-electrons are involved so that no limit on η results from the long-range anisotropy. (For He
therefore, a ﬁrst limit is set by the spin-dipole interaction [14,15]). For Ar through Xe, however, ∆C5 is appreciably
larger than for Ne, suggesting that much smaller suppression ratios should be expected for these heavier atoms.
Indeed, the available experimental evidence for metastable Kr [38] and Xe [39], with, according to Table III, approx.
200 and 700 times larger ∆C5

2 than Ne, respectively, showed basically no suppression at all.

VII. COMPARISON WITH METASTABLE XENON EXPERIMENTS.

The most extensive set of data is available for Xe, where recent experiments [39] suggest that spin-polarization
does not lead to suppression of the ionization rate for any of the available isotopes; for all bosonic isotopes, spin-
polarization even seems to increase the ionization rate. From the discussion in Subsection VI C one would already
expect η to be less than 10 in this case. However, additional dynamical eﬀects due to the larger mass of Xe, and
the diﬀerence in short-range potentials compared to Ne should also be taken into account. These changes can be
easily incorporated into our model by substituting Cs potentials [40] for the Na potentials used for Ne, and using the
appropriate mass. We have used the same auto-ionization widths as for Ne, however, since auto-ionization widths for
Xe are not available.

Indeed, suppression by a factor of η

Figure 9 shows the result of such a treatment for a collisions energy of 1µK. Again we varied the amount of phase
available in the triplet-potential to obtain the variation of the ionization rates for polarized and unpolarized clouds
of (Xe) atoms.
10 is still possible, but over 60% of the φ-range in Fig. 9,
η < 1. In fact, the φ-averaged value is now
= 0.7, showing that for Xe ionization suppression by spin-polarization
is very unlikely. Here, the QQ-term mixes up the polarized and unpolarized states so thorougly at long-range that
they basically ionize at the same rate. The fact that η < 1 can then be considered a quantum-statistical eﬀect: for
polarized atoms, the ℓ = 0 partial wave necessarily represents a greater ﬂux than for unpolarized atoms, since in the
former case the ℓ = 1 partial wave is absent.

VIII. DISCUSSION.

≈

In this paper we have developed a semi-quantitative description of ionization in metastable neon collisions at very
low temperatures. In fact, this description holds for all the heavy metastable rare gas atoms, but we have concentrated
on neon because of ongoing experiments in our laboratory as well as the availability of the properties needed as input
to the model. We have put special emphasis on obtaining a lower limit on the ionization rate for spin-polarized
atoms, in order to investigate the possibilites of reaching Bose-Einstein Condensation with metastable rare gas atoms.
While we are not able to provide a deﬁnitive answer, we do provide a framework of potentials and auto-ionization
widths that allow one to investigate the system in a qualitative way. It has become clear that such a limit depends
strongly on the occurrence of quasi-bound resonances in the potentials for fully polarized atoms with ℓ > 0. While
it is possible to obtain reasonable estimates of the anisotropy of the long-range part of these potentials, suﬃciently
accurate information on the short-range parts is not available at this moment. Such potentials may become available
in the near future, however [41]. Our calculations show that, under favorable conditions, the long-range anisotropy
still allows for very eﬀective suppression (up to 104 times) of ionization by spin-polarization, at least for metastable
Ne. This suppression becomes less eﬀective as the atom becomes heavier, with a limit of η

10 for Xe.

Additional couplings may exist between the quintet states and the ionizing states that we have not considered.
Such couplings may occur at smaller R, where core-valence interactions become more important. The interactions
that will have an eﬀect on the ionization rate for spin-polarized atoms must create a direct coupling between a quintet
state and other, ionizing states. For Xe, e.g., one should expect a large eﬀect of the second-order spin-orbit splitting
from the experience with Cs [6,7]. A simple splitting of the various quintet potentials, however, due to a dependence
of the potentials on a σ or π orientation of the cores, does not have such an eﬀect, at least not for small magnetic
conﬁning ﬁelds. This is because metastable rare gas atoms in general lack hyperﬁne-structure, so that exothermic
exit channels do not exist. As a result, depolarization through such a mechanism is prohibited. We have checked this
by adding a phenomenological σ/π core-splitting to our potentials, with an order of magnitude comparable to that
found in the Ne+Ne+-system [42]. The ionization rate for polarized atoms was found to increase only slightly with
the magnitude of this splitting.

A large magnetic conﬁning ﬁeld, however, could cause Zeeman splittings greater than the centrifugal barrier present
in the ℓ > 0 quintet states. This would open up new channels for depolarizing collisions that require only a splitting
within the quintet states. Given the height of the centrifugal barrier, 5.8 mK for Ne and ℓ = 2, such processes should
be expected to be fully developed at magnetic ﬁelds of approximately 60 Gauss. It may be proﬁtable, therefore, to
use the minimum practical trapping ﬁeld for metastable rare gas atom traps.

Another factor that we have not taken into account is that curve-crossings of the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2) states can occur
system at some intermediate range. For
+Ne

}
Ne, it is possible to develop potentials for this full system with the recipe developed in Sec. IV. The result of such
a treatment is shown in Fig. (10). In this case, the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2) quintet states indeed cross several states with
other asymptotic limits. Closer inspection has taught us that some of these are indeed avoided crossings, with the
coupling due to the DD- and QQ-interactions. At the crossing points, a second order treatment of the DD-interaction
in fact no longer suﬃces. Flux entering on one of the quintet states can now be diverted onto curves that allow
ionization to occur at short range. In order for the eﬀect of such crossings to be taken into account, an R-dependent
treatment of the DD- and QQ-interactions would be necessary, and in addition a much larger system of coupled
equations would have to be solved. We consequently leave such a treatment to a future paper.

or excluding the eﬀect of the quadrupole-quadrupole (QQ) interaction on the potentials. For the polarized case the results
are labeled“DD + QQ” and “DD only”, respectively. In general, these rates drop by about an order of magnitude when the
QQ-term is omitted. For the unpolarized case, the solid lines give the result including, and the triangles the result excluding
the QQ-term. Little diﬀerence is observed in this case.

FIG. 6. Partial ionization rates for trapped Ne(3P2)-atoms as a function of the depth of the Na2(1Σ+

g )-potential from which
the potentials of the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2)-system are calculated. The depth of the Na2(1Σ+
g )-potential is given in terms of the
semi-classical phase φ [see Eq. (26)]. Only relatively small variations in the rates are observed, indicating the minor inﬂuence of
quasi-bound resonances in the ionizing states on the ionization rate of the non-ionizing, polarized quintet states. The collision
energy is E = 1µK.

FIG. 7. Partial ionization rates for trapped Ne(3P2)-atoms as a function of the depth of the Na2(3Σ+

u )-potential from which
the potentials of the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2)-system are calculated. The depth of the Na2(3Σ+
u )-potential is given in terms of the
semi-classical phase φ (see Eq. (26)). Very large variations in the rates are observed, indicating narrow quasi-bound resonances
occurring in the non-ionizing quintet states. These may adversely aﬀect the possiblities of achieving BEC with metastable rare
gases. The collision energy is E = 1µK.

. A quadratic dependence of the rate for polarized atoms on the anisotropy parameter is observed. Arrows
indicating the estimated anisotropy parameter for metastable He, Ne through Xe (listed in Table III), illustrate the decrease
in ionization suppression ratio with increasing rare gas atom mass. The collision energy is E = 1µK.

FIG. 9. Same as Fig. 7 but for Xe instead of Ne, replacing the Ne mass by that of Xe, and the Na-potentials by those of
Cs. The larger anisotropy in the case of Xe leads to much greater polarized ionization rates than for Ne, often exceeding those
for unpolarized atoms. A suppression η = 10 is possible, but values η < 1 are more likely. The collision energy is E = 1µK.

FIG. 10. Adiabatic potentials for the Ne{(2p)53s}+Ne{(2p)53s}-system including all ﬁne-structure states. The zero-point
of the energy scale corresponds to the asymptotic energy of the Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2)-conﬁguration. Compared to the re-
duced set of Fig. (1), deeper wells (resembling more closely the Na2(1Σ+
g ) state) have developed in the states connected
asymptotically to Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2), indicating the relaxation of the asymptotic spin-orbit conﬁguration. Crossings of the
Ne(3P2)+Ne(3P2)-system with other asymptotic conﬁgurations are indicated as well. Such crossings may lead to reduced
ionization suppression by funneling ﬂux onto ionizing potentials.

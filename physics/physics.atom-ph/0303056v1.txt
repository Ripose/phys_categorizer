Eﬀects of the interchannel coupling on the spin polarization of energetic photoelectrons emitted
from atomic Ne valence subshells are examined. Like previously obtained results for cross sections
and angular distributions, the photoelectron spin polarization parameters too are found considerably
inﬂuenced by the coupling. The result completes a series of studies to ﬁnally conclude that the
independent particle description is inadequate for the entire range of photoionization dynamics over
the full spectral energy domain.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the spin polarization of photoelectrons
is important primarily on two counts. Firstly, since
this eﬀect originates from purely relativistic interactions,
its behavior provides insights into relativistic aspects
of the dynamical correlation which are inaccessible by
conventional studies of cross section and angular distri-
bution; in the photoionization of lighter atoms, which
may normally seem tractable by a non-relativistic ap-
proach, sizable resonance features in spin polarization
spectra of emerging electrons can be found when rela-
tivistic forces are included[1, 2]. Secondly, spin resolved
spectroscopic measurements in conjunction with cross
section and angular distribution data provide a compre-
hensive methodology to completely characterize the pho-
toionization process[3, 4]. As a virtual beginning of the
interest in the ﬁeld, the emission of highly spin polar-
ized electrons over a limited range of the ejection angle
near the Cooper minimum of the photoionization cross
section was predicted by Fano many years ago[5]. Since
then, the spin polarization of photoelectrons emanating
from unpolarized atoms has been the subject of several
theoretical and experimental investigations (for reviews
see Refs. [6, 7]). However, the focus of all these studies
has been the low photon energy range (VUV and soft
X-ray), over which it is a common knowledge that the
electron correlation, in its complete form including inter-
channel coupling, is signiﬁcant and often dominating.

On the other hand, at photon energies far away
from the ionization threshold, it was believed until re-
cently that the independent particle (IP) framework,
which completely disregards electron correlation, can ad-
equately describe the photoionization process[8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13]. However, over a series of combined experimental
and theoretical studies this notion has recently been cor-
rected for the cross section and the angular distribution
asymmetry parameter[14, 15, 16]. Interchannel coupling
has been shown to be a crucial determinant of the quan-

titative accuracy of these parameters in the intermediate
and the high energy regime for photoelectrons emitted
from both inner and outer atomic subshells. From a per-
turbative perspective, the eﬀect originates from the cor-
rection to the single channel matrix element from a con-
tinuum conﬁguration interaction among all neighboring
channels[14]. Since the dynamical diﬀerence among rela-
tivistic (spin-orbit) channels arising from a given subshell
determines the spin polarization character of electrons
photoejected from that subshell, it is of particular inter-
est to examine how the spin polarization parameters are
aﬀected by correlation in the form of interchannel cou-
pling mechanism. In this paper, we focus on this aspect
by investigating the spin polarization parameters of the
valence 2p photoelectrons from atomic Ne.

II. ESSENTIAL THEORETICAL DETAILS

The

relativistic-random phase

approximation
(RRPA)[17, 18] has been employed to perform the
calculation. The RRPA calculation starts from an ex-
plicitly relativistic basis so that relativistic interactions
are included ab initio.
In addition to the ground state
correlation, as well as two-electron promotion in the
residual Ne-ion core, RRPA incorporates interchannel
coupling among all of the single excitation/ionization
ﬁnal state channels. We use a framework in which the
coupling among selective members of the relativistic
dipole-allowed jj-coupled channels:

can be chosen. The calculation has been carried out in
both the length and the velocity gauge formalism; the
good agreement between length and velocity results, even
at highest photon energy considered, indicates the nu-
merical accuracy of our calculation. It may be mentioned

here that RRPA has been used previously with reason-
able success to study the spin polarization of photoelec-
trons from noble gases, but only in the low photon energy
range[19].

In this calculation, we have considered the case where
the target atom is unpolarized and the polarization of
the residual ion is not observed. Equivalently, the polar-
ization of the target atom is averaged out and that of the
residual ion is summed over. The dipole photoionization
can then be completely described, in general, by a set of

ﬁve dynamical parameters σ, β, ξ, η, and ζ, wherein σ
is the partial cross section, β is the angular distribution
asymmetry parameter and the others are the photoelec-
tron spin polarization parameters. These dynamical pa-
rameters can be expressed in terms of the reduced dipole
matrix elements[17] of the process. The explicit expres-
sions for the spin polarization parameters corresponding
to both 2p 1
photoelectrons of Ne are given

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

and 2p 1

In order to uncover the details of how the interchannel
coupling inﬂuences the photoelectron spin polarization
dynamics we have performed ﬁve separate calculations
photoionization of Ne with vary-
for the 2p 3
ing degrees of interchannel coupling. These are (i) no
interchannel coupling among channels arising from dif-
ferent relativistic subshells, (ii) coupling of all channels
from 2p 3
2 subshells, (iii) from 2p and 2s sub-
shells, (iv) from 2p and 1s subshells, and (v)from all four

subshells together (full calculation). Since, in calculation
(i), we ignore all eﬀects of interchannel coupling between
channels arising from diﬀering relativistic subshells, this
is similar to the relativistic independent particle (IP) de-
scription, except that ground state correlations are in-
cluded along with coupling among channels arising from
the same subshell.

An elegant approach to understand the relative impor-
tance of the coupling with diﬀerent neighboring channels
has been described in Ref. [14] in the spirit of a ﬁrst order
perturbation theory. Under the inﬂuence of a perturbing
degenerate channel J the corrected wavefunctions Ψ2pj
for any dipole channel 2pj →
ks1/2(kdj′ ) (see Eq. (1))
from either of 2pj(j = 1/2, 3/2) subshells are given, at

where ψ’s denote unperturbed wavefunctions, which are eigenfunctions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0, and the
ﬁnal state total angular momentum j′ has two dipole allowed values 5/2 and 3/2. In Eq. (6), the matrix element under
the energy integration is the interchannel coupling matrix element with H being the full Hamiltonian of the system.

The correction term on the right side of Eq. (8) can be
signiﬁcant if two conditions are simultaneously satisﬁed.
First, the spatial overlap between the perturbed and per-
turbing channel wavefunctions must be considerable to
result in a signiﬁcant interchannel coupling matrix ele-
ment; this is expected when the discrete wavefunctions
have the same principle quantum numbers so that they
occupy the same region of space and have signiﬁcant over-
lap, and the respective ionization thresholds are close so
that at high enough energies the electrons from both sub-
shells have similar momenta, which enable the continuum
wavefunctions to oscillate roughly “in phase”. Second,
the magnitude of the unperturbed matrix element of the
perturbing channel is considerably larger than that of the
perturbed channel. Now the form of the energy integral
suggests that the primary contribution of interchannel
interaction will come from the values of the integrand
at E′
Importantly further, the electron contin-
uum wavefunctions, participating in the energy integral,

E.

≃

must be normalized per unit energy through a multiplica-
−2E−1/4 [21]. Therefore, the leading
tion by a factor m¯h
energy behavior of the interchannel coupling matrix ele-
ment in Eq. (6) turns out to be E−1/2 when the energy
is high enough. Evidently, considering Eq. (8), if the un-
coupled matrix element DJ of channel J decreases with
energy slower by a factor E1/2 or more than the corre-
sponding decay of D2pj
→ks1/2(kdj′ ), the resulting eﬀect of
the coupling will be considerable, provided the interchan-
nel coupling matrix element is signiﬁcant. Indeed, this
leads us to expect a strong eﬀect of the 2s channels (with
Dirac-Fock threshold 52.68 eV) on 2pj photoionization
(with thresholds 23.08 eV for j = 3/2 and 23.21 eV for
j = 1/2). This is clearly seen in Fig. 1 which gives our cal-
culated results for the 2p1/2 and the 2p3/2 subshell cross
sections in each of the ﬁve calculations described above;
at the highest energies, the cross section results are seen
to essentially coalesce into just two curves - those includ-
ing coupling between and those omitting that coupling

form the other. This was noted previously in Ref. [14]
where similar calculations were performed. Because the
high energy uncoupled photoionization cross section for
an nl subshell falls oﬀ with energy as E−(7/2+l), the cor-
rection term in Eqs. (8) falls oﬀ in the limit of ω
E,
as E−(5/4+l/2))[22]. As applied to the present case, the
perturbation of D2pj by D2s falls oﬀ as E−(5/4+l/2), the
same as the falloﬀ of the D2pj themselves, so that the per-
turbation is of the same order of size as the uncoupled
matrix elements. The weak eﬀect of 1s channels on either

of 2pj cross sections, as also seen in Fig. 1, is owing to
the much higher 1s ionization threshold (893.02 eV) that
results in poor overlap of the continuum wavefunctions
in ensuing interchannel coupling matrix element, along
with the fact that the discrete 1s and 2pj occupy very
diﬀerent regions of space and, therefore, overlap poorly.

or only-2p 1

In addition, what is rather interesting to note in Fig. 1
is the tiny eﬀect from the coupling between the chan-
nels from the spin-orbit split 2pj subshells. The curve
chan-
(thin solid) corresponding to only-2p 3
nels (calculation (1), similar to the IP result) diﬀers very
little in the lower part of the energy range (Fig. 1(a))
when compared to the curve (dotted) from all 2p channels
combined; however, both the curves practically merge to-
gether at higher energies (Fig. 1(b)) indicating virtually
no eﬀect from the coupling. This phenomenon can be un-
derstood as follows. It is true that the interchannel cou-
pling matrix element between the 2p 3
2 channels
is strong due to the close proximity of their respective
ionization thresholds. But since the high energy falloﬀ
of D2p3/2 and D2p1/2 are the same, the ensuing coupling
corrections (Eq. (8)) fall oﬀ eﬀectively as E−1/2 at higher
energy, explaining how the small coupling eﬀect at lower
energies becomes practically zero at higher energies.

2 and 2p 1

Looking at our results for the spin polarization param-
eters, Figs. 2 through 5, rather diﬀerent phenomenology
is evident; signiﬁcant eﬀects resulting from the coupling
between the channels arising from the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2
spin-orbit subshells are noted! Understanding the un-
derlying reason(s) for this phenomenology is somewhat
more complex than for the cross sections owing to the
fact that the spin polarization parameters depend upon
both the magnitudes and the phases of the dipole matrix
elements, as seen from Eqs. (2-4). Thus, an understand-
ing of the modiﬁcation of the phase shifts engendered by
interchannel coupling is also of importance.

Starting from Eq. (8) and explicitly introducing the un-
perturbed (θ) and the perturbed (Θ) phase-shift through
the notations D =

important to note here that this decay is much slower
than E−1/2 due to the logarithmic nature of the correc-

of each of the Figs. 2 through 5. Evidently, for all the
spin polarization parameters the eﬀect of this coupling
is stronger at relatively low energies. This is clearly be-
cause the strength of the interchannel coupling matrix
element decreases with increasing energy, as discussed
above. But, as already made clear from the correspond-
ing cross section results, this coupling does not strongly
aﬀect the magnitude of the 2pj dipole matrix elements.
And since their unperturbed phases are nearly equal, the
coupling does not alter their phases much (see Eq. (9)).
As a consequence, our results (not shown) of the angu-
lar distribution asymmetry parameter β, that depends
on both the matrix elements and the phases, shows min-
imal eﬀect of this coupling. But if the coupling aﬀects
neither the dipole matrix elements nor the phases sig-
niﬁcantly, how then can it aﬀect the spin polarization
parameters? The answer lies in the fact that the values
of the 2pj spin polarization parameters arise from com-
plicated combinations of the dipole matrix elements and
their phases, Eqs. (2-4), resulting in signiﬁcant cancella-
tions, so that small diﬀerences in dipole matrix elements
and phases can be magniﬁed to produce the results seen.
The fact that the non-relativistic limit of spin polariza-
tion parameters are zero while for the β parameter it is
ﬁnite and close to its relativistic value indicates that such
a cancellation mechanism is indeed operative for the spin
polarization parameters.

For all of the spin polarization parameters, the result of
this coupling, however, exhibits a rather slow monotonic
tendency to converge to the corresponding eﬀective IP-
like prediction, with increasing energy, much slower than
the convergence of the cross section. This is because the
spin polarization parameters depend upon phase shift dif-
ferences as well, and these were shown above to converge
more slowly than the magnitudes of the dipole matrix
elements. This was also seen earlier in connection with
β which also depends on phase shifts[14]. Further, note
that this coupling induces in general a stronger inﬂuence
on the spin polarization of 2p 3
electrons than on that
2
of 2p 1
2 electrons, except for η (Fig. 3) where the results
of both subshells have similar eﬀect from this coupling.
To provide some quantitative estimates, ξ (Fig. 2(a)) and
2 electrons show respectively about
δ (Fig. 5(a)) for 2p 3
30% and 40% modiﬁcation compared to the uncoupled
results at roughly 300 eV photon energy; as expected,
these diﬀerences decrease gradually as the energy in-
creases. On the other hand, ζ for 2p 1
electrons (Fig. 4(b),
2
that is related to the corresponding β simply through
β2p1/2/2, shows an almost negligible eﬀect
ζ2p1/2 = 1
from this coupling.

Interchannel coupling of the 2p channels with either 2s
or 1s channels involves alterations in both the magnitudes
and phases of the 2p dipole matrix elements. Coupling
with the 2s channels aﬀects the magnitudes of the 2p 3
dipole matrix elements very strongly, as clearly
and 2p 1
indicated in Fig. 1. But the phases are also strongly af-
fected (see Eq. (9)). With the 1s coupling on the other

hand, while the modiﬁcations to the magnitudes of the
2pj dipole matrix elements are already small, except in a
very small region around the 1s threshold, the alterations
of the 2pj phase shifts are also small. But it is non-trivial
to assess in which direction the changes in these dynam-
ical quantities, the magnitudes and the phases of the 2pj
dipole matrix elements, will induce changes in the spin
polarization parameters. For two of the spin polarization
parameters, ξ (Fig. 2) and δ (Fig. 5), the eﬀect of 2s and
1s coupling on 2pj ionization is certainly not as straight-
forward as in the case of cross sections where only the
magnitudes of the matrix elements (and not the phases)
are important.
In addition, by virtue of the diﬀerent
functional dependence of the parameters on the magni-
tudes of the dipole matrix elements and phase-shifts, the
qualitative behavior of the result changes from one pa-
rameter to another.

As seen in Fig. 2, the eﬀect of 1s and 2s coupling on
2pj for the parameter ξ are roughly complementary until
about 900 eV photon energy, the position of 1s Rydberg
resonances; as a result, the deviation between the dotted
(all 2p channels included) and thick solid (full calcula-
tion) results remain approximately constant. Beyond the
resonance region the relative eﬀect of 1s coupling drops
oﬀ. However, over the entire energy range considered, the
full calculation diﬀers from the eﬀective IP result (thin
solid curve). This diﬀerence is signiﬁcant for 2p 3
2 show-
ing a maximum alteration of about 25% at 300 eV, while
for 2p 1
2

the diﬀerence is rather small.

For parameters η and ζ, on the other hand, the 1s
and 2s coupling inﬂuence the result quite in the simi-
lar qualitative manner as they do for the cross section.
Along almost the complete energy range, albeit the near-
threshold region (where interchannel coupling is known
to be important), η for both 2p 3
2 (Figs. 3(a,b))
2 ζ (Fig. 4(a)) suggest an almost steady
as well as 2p 3
coupling contribution of more than 25% over the cor-
responding eﬀective IP prediction. For 2p 1
ζ (Fig. 4(b)),
2
of course, the eﬀect is small at lower energies which, how-
ever, increases gradually with energy to yield over 20%
correction.

2 and 2p 1

The parameter δ (Fig. 5) being a combination of pa-
rameters ξ and ζ exhibits a rather mixed behavior. For
2p 3
2 photoionization (Fig. 5(a)) a maximum of 40% cou-
pling eﬀect is seen at around 300 eV that monotonically
diminishes with increasing energy to eventually produce
about 20% eﬀect over the high energy range. For 2p 1
2
(Fig. 5(b)) the eﬀect of the coupling, that is weak at low
energies, rises steadily to reach a value of about 20% at
the heighest energy considered.

These results clearly demonstrate that, as in the case
of cross sections and angular distributions, the eﬀect of
interchannel coupling on the photoelectron spin polariza-
tion is considerable. However, due to the sensitivity of
the spin polarization to relative phase-shifts the results
exhibit behavior that is qualitatively diﬀerent from that
of the cross section results. While for the cross section,

the high energy interchannel coupling eﬀect generically
increases going from lower to higher photon energies, for
most of the spin polarization parameters a strong cou-
pling contribution appears already at low energies. As a
consequence, a substantial coupling correction exists for
these parameters over a very broad spectral range. Fur-
thermore, coupling with 1s channels, which inﬂuences the
cross section only over a narrow range, extends its inﬂu-
ence over a much larger energy range for the 2pj spin
polarization parameters owing to the much slower drop-
oﬀ of the phase shift corrections induced by interchannel
coupling. Finally, we note that although we have illus-
trated the eﬀect with an example of valence photoioniza-
tion of Ne, the same mechanism of conﬁguration interac-
tions in the continuum (interchannel coupling) must be
operative for the spin-polarization of photoejected elec-
trons from any arbitrary atom or atomic ion and from
any subshell.

tron correlation via interchannel coupling over the entire
spectral range. Unlike to the cross section, where only
the coupling-induced alteration of the magnitudes of ma-
trix elements is responsible for the behavior, modiﬁcation
of the phase-shifts play an important role determining
the eﬀect on the spin polarization. For the cross sec-
tion and the angular distribution the importance of in-
terchannel coupling for energetic photoemission has been
demonstrated previously[14]. With the current result we
conclude, therefore, that in order to acquire a complete
knowledge of photoionization dynamics unambiguously
over the range from VUV all the way to hard x-rays,
theoretical study including the interchannel coupling is
absolutely required.

[22] From this very simple argument it is easy to show that the
full partial cross section for any nl(l > 0) photoionization
will always behave as E−9/2 in the limit E → ∞ owing
to the interaction with nearby nl(l = 0) channels. This
corresponds to a part of the result obtained in Ref. ([23])

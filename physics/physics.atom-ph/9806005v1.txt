CITED STATES AND LOW-LYING RESONANCES OF THE DIPOSITRO-
NIUMS

ABSTRACT: Symmetry has imposed very strong constraints on the struc-
ture of the internal wavefunctions and on the accessibility of outgoing chan-
nels. Based on symmetry consideration, the existence of a number of bound
excited states and low-lying resonances has been suggested.

PACS: 36.10.Dr, 02.20.-a

The existence of the dipositroniums Ps2 has not yet been experimentally
conﬁrmed, but has already been predicted by a number of theoretical calcu-
lations [1-6]. Recently, in addition to the ground state, a bound excited state
with total orbital angular momentum L=1 and parity Π = −1 has also been
predicted [7,8]. How many bound states will this system contain? What is
the feature of the low-lying spectrum? These questions are attractive. In
this paper we shall study this problem based on symmetry consideration and
based on existing theoretical results.

Since the Hamiltonian of the dipositronium is invariant to the permuta-
tions isomorphic to the point group D2d [2], The eigenstates can be classiﬁed
according to the representations µ of the D2d group, µ = A1, A2, B1, B2, or
E.. Since the Hamiltonian is also invariant to rotation and space inversion,
an eigenstate can be labeled as LΠ
i (µ), i is a serial number for a series of
states with the same (L,Π, µ) [9]. When i = 1, it is the lowest state of this
series; in this case the label i will be omitted. It is noted that the spin-state is
determined by µ. Let the two electrons be the particles 1 and 2, the positrons
be 3 and 4. Let the spins of 1 and 2 be coupled to s1, and the spins of 3
and 4 be coupled to s2. When µ = A1 or B2, we have (s1, s2) = (0, 0);when
µ = B1 or A2, we have (s1, s2) = (1, 1);when µ = E, we have (s1, s2) = (0, 1)
or (1,0).

Evidently, the stability of an eigenstate depends on the coupling of this
state with the open channels. Whether a channel is open or closed is deter-

1

mined not only by energy but also by symmetry. For the dipositronium, the
most important (the lowest) outgoing channel is the Ps-Ps channel , where
both Ps are in the ground state, with threshold energy −0.5 (atomic units
are used in this paper). Let us see how the symmetry will impose constraints
on this channel.

(i) Let l be the relative orbital angular momentum between the two
positroniums. Since each positronium is in its ground state with zero or-
bital angular momentum, we have l =L and parity Π = (−1)L. This fact
implies that for all the states with Π(−1)L = −1, the Ps-Ps channel is closed.
(ii) Let pij denotes an interchange of i and j. Since s1 and s2 are good

quantum numbers, an eigenstate is written as
Ψ = [(1 + (−1)s1p12)(1 + (−1)s2p34)F ]χs1s2
where F is a function of the spatial coordinates and χs1s2 is the spin state.

(iii) When (s1, s2) = (0, 0) or (1,1), the spatial wavefunction is an eigen-
state of p13p24 with the eigenvalues Λ = ±1[2,9]. In this case the Fopen is
nonzero only if L=even. When (s1, s2) = (0, 0) or (1,1) and L=even, one can
prove that

p13p24Fopen = Fopen
Eq.(3) implies that, for all the states with Λ = −1, the Ps-Ps channel is

(3)

closed.

Eq.(1) to (3) impose a strong constraint on the quantum numbers (L, Π,
µ) of the open channels. Let us consider all the L≤ 2 states (the discussion
can be generalized to L≥ 3 states as well). There are thirty types of (L, Π,
µ) symmetries involved as listed in Table 1. However, owing to the above
constraints, only the
i (B1),1−
0+
i (A1),0+
states are allowed to access the Ps-Ps channel, while all the states of the

i (A1), and 2+

i (E),2+

i (B1)

other twenty-ﬁve symmetries are not allowed. The accessibility of the Ps-Ps
channel is listed in Table 1. Since the Ps-Ps channel is closed to most LΠ(µ)
states, the existence of a number of bound states is possible. In fact, for the
states with the Ps-Ps channel closed, those with their energies lower than the
second lowest threshold Ps-Ps* (one of the positronium is at the ﬁrst excited
states) are deﬁnitely bound .

The above procedure can be generalized to analyses any out going chan-
nel. For example, let us inspect the Ps-Ps*(01) channel, in which the excited
positronium has (n2l2) = (01). In this case, we have
Fopen = (1 + (−1)s1p12)(1 + (−1)s2p34) P

+(−1)s1[Φ(
When (s1, s2) = (0, 0) or (1,1) , we have
p13p24Fopen = −Fopen
(6)
Therefore, this channel is closed if Λ = +1. Furthermore, if L=0, we have
l = 1 and Π = +1; therefore this channel is closed for LΠ = 0− states. The
analysis on the accessibility of outgoing channels is summarized in the last
three columns of Table 1.

Another important factor aﬀecting the low-lying spectrum is the acces-
sibility of speciﬁc geometric conﬁgurations. Let A denote a geometric con-
ﬁguration, let ∆ denote a comprehensive symmetric operation (successive
operations of rotation, permutation, and space inversion). In some cases we
have ∆A = A. For example, if A is a square with the two electrons 1 and
2 at the two ends of a diagonal and 3 and 4 at the two ends of the other
diagonal (denoted as SQ hereafter), then A is invariant to a space inversion
together with p12p34. A is also invariant to a rotation about the normal of
the plane by 90◦ together with a cyclic permutation of particles, and invari-
ant to a rotation about a diagonal by 180◦ together with an interchange of
the two particles at the other diagonal. Let the operator ∆′ be deﬁned as
∆′Ψ(A) = Ψ(∆A). When A is invariant to ∆, we have

(∆′ − 1)Ψ(A) = 0
Owing to the transformation property inhering in Ψ under symmetric op-

(7)

(5)

erations, (7) is equivalent to a set of homogeneous linear algebra equations
that Ψ has to fulﬁll at A. The details of the equations depend on the trans-
formation property of Ψ , i.e., depend in general on (L, Π, µ) . It is well
known that homogeneous equations do not always have nonzero solution. In
some cases, there are only zero solutions. In this case Ψ has to be zero at A
, i.e., there is a node at A and Ψ is prohibited to access the shape A. For
example, when A is the SQ and ∆ is a space inversion together with p12p34,
(7) is rewritten as

((-1)s1+s2Π − 1)Ψ(A) = 0
Thus, for all the states with (-1)s1+s2Π = −1, Ψ must be zero at the SQ
disregarding the size and orientation of the SQ. Therefore these states are
prohibited to access the SQ.

(8)

The identiﬁcation of the accessibility has been given in detail in [9]. The
results are summarized here in Table 1. When the particles form a geometric
conﬁguration in which the repulsive interaction can be overcome by attrac-
tive interaction (e.g., the SQ), then the domain in the multi-dimensional
coordinate space surrounding this conﬁguration is favorable to binding and
would be preferred by the low-lying states. On the other hand, unfavorable
conﬁgurations are not important to low-lying states, these conﬁgurations are
not included in Table 1. It is noted that eq.(4) is irrelevant to the orien-
tation and the size of the shape A [9]. Therefore, if Ψ can not access A,
it can not access all the shapes which are diﬀerent from A by size or by
orientation.
It leads to a fact that inherent nodal surface would exist in
the wavefunctions at the shapes that can not be accessed. It is well known
that the low-lying states do not prefer to contain nodal surfaces. The more
nodal surfaces are contained, the higher the energy. For example, for the
positronium, the ground state does not contain nodal surfaces. The degen-
erate ﬁrst excited state either contains a node associated with radial motion
(if L=0), or contains a node associated with angular motion (if L=1); the
second excited state contains two nodal surfaces, etc. Therefore, the inac-
cessibility of shapes implies that inherent nodal structure has been imposed
on the wavefunctions by symmetry, this inherent nodal structure will aﬀect
the energy seriously. For the states prohibited to access many shapes, many
nodal surfaces are contained, thus these states must be high in energy. On
the other hand, there are some states do not contain inherent nodal sur-
faces, namely the 0+(A1),1−(E),2+(A1), and 2+(B1) , their wavefunctions
can be optimized to lower the internal energy without suﬀering restriction.

4

Therefore these states, if they are bound, must be lower.

Based on the knowledge provided by Table 1and based on the existing
theoretical results, we can deduce the existence of a number of excited bound
states and the feature of the low-lying spectrum as follows.

Besides the ground state 0+(A1) which has already been predicted to be
bound by many authors [1-6], Kinghorn and Poshusta have calculated all the
0+ states [2]. For the 0+(E) and 0+(B2), the upper limits of energy are -0.33
and -0.3145 , respectively. Both values are lower than the Ps-Ps* threshold at
-0.3125. From Table 1 we know that they can not access the Ps-Ps channel.
Thus, these two states should be bound. For the 0+(E) state, the average
separation between the electrons hr12i = 9.56, while the average separation
between an electron and a positron hr13i = 8.34 . For the 0+(B2) state,
hr12i = 12.6 and hr13i = 10.2. The sizes of these two states are comparable
with the ground state (with hr12i = 6.03 and hr13i = 4.48) , this is a further
evidence that they are bound. Otherwise, if they are resonances, they should
have a much larger size. Between these two the size of the 0+(B2) is a little
larger than that of the 0+(E), because the 0+(B2) is quite close to the Ps-
Ps* threshold. For the 0+(B1) and 0+
2 (A1) states, the upper limits given
in [2] are -0.4994 and -0.4995, and the hr12i are 50.1 and 84.2, respectively.
If they really have their energies a little above the Ps-Ps threshold at -0.5,
they are resonances because the Ps-Ps channel is open to them. However,
if their actual energies are a little lower than the threshold, then they are
bound. For the 0+(A2) state, the upper limit given in [2] is -0.3121, and
the hr12i is106.1. If this state really has its energy a little above the Ps-Ps*
threshold, it is a resonance because the Ps-Ps* channel is open. However, if
its energy is actually a little lower than the threshold at-0.3125, then it is
bound because the Ps-Ps channel at -0.5 is closed (cf. Table 1). Thus, a very
accurate calculation on the energies of the 0+(B1) , 0+
2 (A1), and 0+(A2) is
necessary to identify whether these states are bound.

From Table 1 it is clear that both the Ps-Ps and Ps-Ps* channels are
closed to the 0−(µ) states. Besides, by using the same procedure of analysis
as above, one can prove that neither the Ps-Ps*(nl) channels (where one of
the positronium is excited to a state with arbitrary n and l), nor the Ps− −e+
(or Ps+−e−) channel with the threshold at -0.262, nor the Ps−e+−e− channel
with the threshold energy -0.25 are open to the 0−(µ) states. This fact can be
illustrated simply by a partial-wave decomposition. Let l1, l2, and l3 be the
partial waves associated with the three Jacobian coordinates of a four-body

5

system. Let (l1l2l3)L denotes a partial-wave component of the spatial wave
function, where the angular momenta are coupled to L. It is obvious that for
L=0 odd-parity states, none of the li can be zero. If it does, say, l1 = 0; then
l2 must be equal to l3 to assure L=0. This choice results in having an even
parity, and therefore can not be realized in odd-parity states. However, in
the Ps-Ps*(nl) channels and in the Ps−e+ − e− channel, the orbital angular
momentum of the Ps is zero; in the Ps− − e+ channel the relative angular
momentum between the Ps− and the e+ is zero (because the ground state of
Ps− has total orbital angular momentum zero). Therefore all these channels
are closed to the 0−(µ) states. Hence, if any of the 0−(µ) state is lower than
-0.25, this state is bound because no outgoing channels are available. Thus
the existence of bound 0−(µ) states is possible. From Table 1 it is clear that
all the 0−(µ) states contain a number of inherent nodal surfaces, therefore
the energies of these states are high. However, the 0+(A2) contains also a
number of inherent nodal surfaces, but the upper limit of this state is only
-0.3121. There is no reason to assert that the 0−(µ) states should be much
higher than the 0+(A2). Thus, it is very possible that one (or even more than
one) bound 0−(µ) state(s) would exist in high energy region of the spectrum.
The ﬁrst candidate would be the 0−(B1) (due to containing relatively less
inherent nodal surfaces). This suggestion remains to be conﬁrmed. The
anticipated bound states are listed in Table 2

Usukura, Varga, and Suzuki have calculated a 1− state with (s1, s2) =
(0, 0) [8]. The µ of this state has two possibilities A1 or B2. However, since
the 1−(A1) contains a number of inherent nodal surfaces as shown in Table
1, it should be much higher than the 1−(B2) . Therefore, the state calculated
in [8] with an energy -0.3344 should be the 1−(B2) . This state is coupled
with the ground state via the E1 transition, therefore it can be induced via
γ−absorption. Since the Ps-Ps channel is close to it (cf. Table 1), it is a
bound state as ﬁrst pointed out in [8]. From Table 1 we know that this
state can access the straight chain CH, it is a shape favorable to binding
in which each pair of repulsive interaction can be overcome by attractive
interaction. From Table 1 of [9] we know that this chain prefer to be normal
to the direction of L. The correlation functions given in Fig.3 of [8] conﬁrms
that the particles prefer to be lying in the X-Y plane if L is given along the
Z-axis. Furthermore, the ratio hr12i/hr13i given in [8] is 1.17. This ratio for
the 0+(E) given in [2] is 1.15. From Table 1 both the 1−(B2) and 0+(E) can
access the favorable straight chain denoted as CH in the Table. Therefore,

6

the internal structures of these two states may be more or less similar. This
point remains to be checked.

From Table 1 we know that the 1−(A2) can also access the straight chain
. Therefore it is anticipated that the energies of the 1−(A2 6) and 1−(B2) are
close. In particular, both would prefer the chain-structure. Since the Ps-Ps
channel is also closed to the 1−(A2), it is also a bound state. Nonetheless,
the 1−(A2) does not coupled with the ground state by the E1 transition,
therefore it is more diﬃcult to be observed experimentally.

The third candidate of the bound L=1 states is the 1+(A2), which is also
not allowed to access the Ps-Ps channel. Although this state can not access
the CH, but it can access the SQ, which is also a shape favorable to binding.
It is anticipated that the 1+(A2) would have an energy not much higher than
those of the 1−(B2 6) and 1−(A2), thereby it would also be bound.

From Table 1 it is clear that the lowest L=1 state should be the 1−(E).
This state, just as the ground state 0+(A1), can access both the most favor-
able conﬁgurations SQ and CH. Thus both states are inherent nodeless and
their internal wavefunctions can be optimized free of constraints. Let the
energy be divided as a sum of internal energy and collective rotation energy
Erot. If the 1−(E) is bound, it is reasonable to assume that its internal energy
is close to or a little higher than the ground state. Accordingly, the excitation
energy of the 1−(E) is mainly equal to the collective rotation energy

(9)

2I0 L(L + 1)

Erot = 1
where I0 is the moment of inertia. Let I0 = 4mer2

0. It is found that if
r0 = 3.95, then Erot = 0.016. Thus, if r0 is a little and suﬃciently larger than
3.95, the energy of the 1−(E) would be lower than the Ps-Ps threshold at
-0.5, and therefore it is bound. Since the radius 3.95 is only a little larger
than that of the ground state, since an excited state usually has a larger
size, the 1−(E) is possible to be bound. If it is not bound, it would be a
resonance a little higher than the Ps-Ps threshold emerging during Ps-Ps
collisions. Nonetheless, since the width of a resonance depends on the details
of dynamics, and can not be foretold simply from symmetry consideration.
Therefore it is not clear whether the width is narrow enough so that the
above proposed resonance can be experimentally observed.

Among the L=1 states the 1+(A1) and 1+(B1) are the only two that
can not access both the Ps-Ps and Ps-Ps*(01 or 10) channels. Therefore,
if they have an energy lower than the Ps-Ps*(02) channel at -0.2778, they

7

are bound. From Table 1 we know that they contain many inherent nodal
surfaces, just as the 0+(A2) does; therefore their internal energies would not
be much higher than the 0+(A2). Since the upper limit of the energy of the
0+(A2) is -0.3121, since the Erot is in general small (it is not larger than 0.016
if r0is not smaller than 3.95), the 1+(A1) and 1+(B1) are anticipated to be
bound.

It is noted that the quantum number Λ [2,9] would change its sign during
an electric transition. Therefore, the ground state (µ = A1) would be coupled
with the LΠ(B2) states with Π = (−1)L via electric transitions. Thus, the
2+(B2) would be coupled with the ground state by E2 transition. Let us
compare the 2+(B2) with the 1−(B2), the Ps-Ps channel is closed to both
states. It is shown in Table 1 that the 2+(B2) can access the SQ but not
the CH, while the 1−(B2) can access the CH but not the SQ. Therefore the
diﬀerence in internal energy between them is not anticipated to be large. The
2+(B2) would be higher than the 1−(B2) mainly due to having a larger Erot.
It is recalled that the 1−(B2) is lower than the Ps-Ps* threshold by 0.022. If
the 2+(B2) is not higher than the 1−(B2) by an amount larger than 0.022, it
is bound. Otherwise, it is a resonance emerging in Ps-Ps*(01) collision and
in γ − absorption.

It is noted that the 2+(E) and the 1−(B2).have similar inherent nodal
structures, the 2−(E) and the 2+(B2).have similar inherent nodal structures.
The internal energies of these states are more or less close to each other.
Thus, the above three L=2 states are either bound states or resonances close
to the Ps-Ps* threshold as listed in Table 2.

The 2−(A1) and 2−(B1) are the only two L=2 states which can not escape
from both the Ps-Ps and Ps-Ps*(01 or 10) channels. Although they contain
many inherent nodal surfaces, their internal energies are not anticipated to
be much higher than the 0+(A2) at -0.3121 [2]. Therefore, it is anticipated
that they would have an energy below the Ps-Ps*(02) threshold at -0.2778,
in this case they are bound.

The anticipated bound states and low-lying resonances are summarized in
Table 2. It is noted that the experimental observation of the aove proposed
resonances may be diﬃcult, it depends on the widths.

In summary, based on symmetry consideration, the accessibility of outgo-
ing channels and a number of important geometric conﬁgurations has been
studied. Thereby a number of bound states and a few low-lying resonances
have been anticipated. It was found that the outgoing channels are seriously

8

constrained by symmetry, the lowest channels are open to only a few LΠ(µ)
states. This is a distinguished feature of the dipositroniums not existing
in many other systems (e.g., not exist in the Ps− system). Accordingly, a
number of bound excited states may exist. Evidently, the above qualitative
results should be checked by accurate theoretical calculations and by exper-
imental data. Incidentally, the values that the upper limits of the 0+(B1)
and the 0+(A2) are -0.4994 and -0.3121 as given in [2] are important to the
above analysis. If these values are changed, some of the above results have
to be changed.

The procedure proposed in this paper can be generalized to study the

qualitative feature of the low-lying spectrum of any few-body system [10].

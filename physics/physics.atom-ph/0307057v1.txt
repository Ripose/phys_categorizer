using a relativistic all-order method. A third-order calculation is also carried out for these matrix
elements to evaluate the importance of the high-order many-body perturbation theory contributions.
The all-order matrix elements are used to evaluate lifetimes of ns and np levels with n = 6, 7, 8 and
nd levels with n = 4, 5, 6 for comparison with experiment and to provide benchmark values for
these lifetimes. The dynamic polarizabilities are calculated for ns states of rubidium. The resulting
lifetime and polarizability values are compared with available theory and experiment.

INTRODUCTION

A recent proposal [1] for quantum computation utilizes
the ground hyperﬁne states of a neutral atom as qubits,
and realizes two-qubit quantum gates by conditional ex-
citations to Rydberg states. The atoms are conﬁned to
the sites of an optical lattice, and the optical potential
seen by the atom depends on the dynamic polarizability
of the atom. Therefore, the atom will generally move in
a diﬀerent lattice potential when it is excited to the Ry-
dberg state during the gate operation, which may cause
motional heating and lead to decoherence. In a recent
paper [2], we proposed two solutions to this problem by
matching the ac polarizabilities of the atom in the ground
and Rydberg states. In the ﬁrst scheme, the polarizabil-
ities are matched for the speciﬁc values of the lattice
photon frequency between the resonances.
In the sec-
ond scheme, some accidental matches between transition
energies are used to match the ground state polarizabil-
ity with the polarizability of the selected Rydberg states
(11p and 15p in the case of Rb). The elimination of mo-
tional decoherence is important in helping to design a
high-ﬁdelity two-qubit gate capable of meeting the error
threshold for scalable quantum computation.

Despite the existence of high-precision measurements
of the primary transition electric-dipole matrix elements
in alkali-metal atoms, accurate experimental data for
other transitions are lacking with the exception of a very
few transitions in Cs owing to the study of parity non-
conservation. In light of the importance of the atomic
calculations for the quantum logic gate scheme with con-
ditional excitations to Rydberg levels, we have calculated
the electric-dipole matrix elements for subsequent evalu-
ation of lifetimes and polarizabilities for a number of Rb
levels. We note that the interest in this particular logic
gate scheme with neutral atoms results from its potential
for fast (sub-microsecond) gate operations.

We have performed all-order calculations of the 7s−np,
8s−np, 4d−np, 5d−np, and 6d−np electric-dipole matrix
elements with n = 5, 6, 7 and 8, and of the 6d − 4f ma-
trix elements. These results are combined with previous

all-order calculations of the 5s − np and 6s − np matrix
elements [3] to obtain values of the lifetimes of the 6s,
7s, 8s, 6p, 7p, 8p, 4d, 5d, and 6d levels. The lifetime of
the 6d3/2 level is of special interest owing to the large
discrepancies between existing experiments [4, 5]. The
third-order matrix-element calculation has also been car-
ried out to evaluate the importance of the higher-order
contributions. The dynamic polarizabilities of the Rb ns
states are also calculated for both low-lying and Rydberg
levels. The evaluation of the accuracy of the polariz-
ability calculations is conducted including a comparison
between our data and other theory and experiment.

II. ELECTRIC-DIPOLE MATRIX ELEMENTS

The electric-dipole matrix elements for the 5s−5p tran-
sitions were measured to high accuracy in [6] and ma-
trix elements for ns − n′p transitions with n = 5, 6 and
n′ = 5, 6, 7, 8 were calculated using a single-double (SD)
all-order method in Refs. [3, 7]. In the present work, we
have calculated matrix elements for 7s − np, 8s − np,
4d − np, 5d − np, and 6d − np transitions with n = 5, 6, 7
and 8 as well as 4f − 6d transitions using SD all-order
method [8]. Very brieﬂy, the wave function is represented
as an expansion

ρmnva are double core and valence excitation coeﬃcients,
respectively. We obtain the equations for the excitation
coeﬃcients by substituting the above wave function into
the many-body Schr¨odinger equation. The equations are
solved iteratively and the resulting expansion coeﬃcients
are used to calculate matrix elements. In such a proce-
dure, certain classes of MBPT terms are summed to all
orders. However, the restriction of the expansion (1) to
the single and double excitations leads to some missing
terms in the expression for the matrix elements start-
ing from the fourth order. As it is important to under-
stand how signiﬁcant higher-order corrections are for the
transitions under consideration, we also conduct separate
third-order calculation of these matrix elements (includ-
ing random-phase approximation (RPA) contributions it-
erated to all orders). The third-order calculation follows
that of Ref. [9]. Such a calculation is of lower accuracy
than the all-order one but the diﬀerence in third-order
and all-order values provides an estimate of the impor-
tance of the higher-order contributions. Also, the break-
down of both all-order and third-order calculations to
diﬀerent contributions yields information regarding rela-
tive importance of the speciﬁc terms and possible large
cancellations between diﬀerent terms. Such information
can be used to approximate some of the omitted contri-
butions and further estimate the uncertainty of the all-
order calculation. We should note that despite the fact
that the entire third-order contribution is contained in
the all-order result, the extraction of the third-order part
from the all-order calculation is not a straightforward
task (see Ref. [7] for the correspondence of the terms),
so a separate calculation is made to obtain third-order

values. The separate calculation also allows us to iterate
RPA contribution to all orders.

We use the system of atomic units, a.u., in which e, me,
4πǫ0 and the reduced Planck constant ¯h have the numer-
ical value 1. Polarizability in a.u. has the dimensions
of volume, and its numerical values presented here are
thus measured in units of a3
0, where a0 ≈ 0.052918 nm is
Bohr radius. The atomic units for α can be be converted
to SI units via α/h [Hz/(V/m)2]=2.48832×10−8α [a.u.],
where the conversion coeﬃcient is 4πǫ0a3
0/h and Planck
constant h is factored out. The atomic unit of frequency
ω is Eh/¯h ≈ 4.1341 × 1016 Hz, where Eh is Hartree en-
ergy.

The third-order and all-order results for ns − n′p tran-
sitions with n, n′ = 5, 6, 7 and 8 are summarized in
Table I together with the lowest-order Dirac-Hartree-
Fock (DHF) values. The corresponding reduced oscillator
strengths calculated using formula [10]

fab = −

are listed in the rows labeled fns→n′p.
In Eq. (2), D
is the dipole operator and λ is a transition wavelength
in nm. The all-order matrix elements and experimental
energies from [11] are used in the oscillator strength cal-
culation. The sum of the f5s→np oscillator strengths with
n = 5, 6, 7, 8 slightly exceeds one because the contribu-
n f5s→np = 1 from the transitions
tions to the sum rule

n = 4, 5, 6 and the n′ = 5, 6, 7, 8 and 6d − 4f matrix ele-
ments are summarized in Table II. The transitions con-

taining the ﬁne structure components, such as ns − 5p1/2
and ns − 5p3/2 pairs, for example, have very similar rela-
tive correlation contributions so we will omit the angular
momentum j subscript in the subsequent discussion. We
ﬁnd that the relative correlation correction contribution
varies very signiﬁcantly with the transition. It is small,
below 7%, for all 6s − np, 7s − np and 8s − np transitions
and for some nd − n′p transitions.
In those situations
where the third order and all-order values diﬀer by less
than a few percent we expect the dipole matrix elements

3

to be accurate to at least 2%.

We should note that in some cases it is possible that
such good agreement of the third-order and all-order val-
ues is fortuitous and may result from accurate cancel-
lations of the high-order terms. We address this issue
below in more detail.

In Ref. [3], the all-order values for the primary tran-
sitions were found to agree with a recent high-accuracy
measurement [6] to within 0.2%–0.35%. The accuracy
of the 5s − 6p, 5s − 7p, and 5s − 8p matrix elements
is, however, substantially lower since they are relatively
small matrix elements with signiﬁcant relative correla-
tion contributions. To investigate the correlation con-
tributions in more detail, we give a breakdown of both
third-order and all-order calculations for eight selected
transitions in Table III. The third-order contributions
are separated to random-phase-approximation (RPA),
Brueckner-orbital (BO), structural radiation (SR) and
normalization (Norm) corrections following Ref. [9]. For
the all-order contributions, three terms (a, c and d) are
listed separately and the other 17 terms are grouped to-
gether in row labeled “Other”. The derivation and ex-
pressions for these terms are given in Refs. [7, 8]. A
normalization correction is given in row labeled “Norm”.
As it was noted earlier, there is no straightforward cor-
respondence of the all-order and third-order breakdown
(full description is given in [7]), but term a partly cor-
responds to RPA-like corrections and term c to BO-like
corrections. Term d is normally small with exception of
some transitions. It is quadratic in single-valence exci-
tation coeﬃcients ρmv and, therefore, contains only ﬁfth
and higher-order terms. We ﬁnd strong cancellations be-
tween BO and RPA terms for 5s−6p, 5s−7p, and 5s−8p
matrix elements. The diﬃculty of the calculation of such
matrix elements has been described before for the case of
Cs [3, 12, 13]. However, we also ﬁnd that term d, which
is missing entirely from third-order calculation is rela-
tively large for 7s − 5p and 7s − 7p matrix elements. It
is rather puzzling since we observe very good agreement
of third-order and all-order results for these transitions.
The possible explanation is accurate cancellation of the
high-order terms for these transitions. We note that term
d is not signiﬁcant for the 6s − 5p transition, for which
some conclusion of accuracy may be drawn from the com-
parison with similar Cs transition matrix elements (which
are measured to quite good accuracy). Accurate mea-
surements of these matrix elements would be very useful
in developing further understanding of this issue. We
note that even though this term is signiﬁcant, it is not
very large, on the order of 5%.

In the case of nd − n′p transitions, the term c (or BO
term for third-order calculation) dominates. The rela-
tive contribution of the correlation correction varies with
the transition. For 5d − 5p and 6d − 6p transitions, the
DHF approximation gives a very poor result; the sign of
the matrix element changes when correlation is added for
6d − 6p matrix elements and the DHF values for 5d − 5p
matrix elements are about 7 times too low. As expected,

we ﬁnd very large, 25% − 30%, diﬀerences between third-
order and all-order calculations for these transitions as
the all-order calculation includes correlation more com-
pletely. The term c can be corrected by including triple
excitations or use of the semi-empirical scaling described
in Refs. [3, 7, 12]. To check the validity of the scaling
approach, we applied such a method to the 5d − 5p ma-
trix elements and compared the resulting ratio with the
experimental measurement [14].

of the 5p3/2 − 5d3/2 and 5p1/2 − 5d3/2 electric-dipole ma-
trix elements divided by the corresponding values of the
C1 reduced matrix elements, where C1 is the normal-
ized spherical harmonic [10]. The present results are
compared with theoretical and experimental values from

Ref. [14]. The corresponding 5d − 5p matrix elements,
divided by the corresponding values of the C1 reduced
matrix elements are also given. The theoretical value
of Ref. [14] was obtained using relativistic third-order
many-body theory [9]; some higher-order Brueckner-
orbital terms were also included, which accounts for the
diﬀerence with our third-order result. As noted above,
the largest contribution to the 5p − 5d matrix elements
calculated using the all-order method comes from the
term c containing single-valence excitation coeﬃcients
ρmv. We scale these excitation coeﬃcients ρmv with the
ratio of the experimental and corresponding theoretical
correlation energies as described in Refs. [3, 12]. We list
the results obtained using such scaling in a row labeled
“Scaled”. We ﬁnd very signiﬁcant diﬀerences between all
high-precision calculations, which indicates that the ac-
curacy of the all-order calculation is around 10-20% for
these matrix elements. However, our all-order result for
the ratio R is in much better agreement with experiment
[14] than the third-order value and theoretical calculation
of Ref. [14].

III. LIFETIMES

We use the resulting all-order matrix elements to cal-
culate the lifetimes of the 6s, 7s, 8s, 6p, 7p, 8p, 4d, 5d,
and 6d levels in Rb for the comparison with experiment
and providing benchmark values for these lifetimes.

The Einstein A-coeﬃcients Avw [10] are calculated us-

ing the formula

Several electric-dipole (E1) transitions contribute to
the lifetime of each of the levels considered here. The
simplest case is that of the 6s level, where only 6s− 5p1/2
and 6s − 5p3/2 transitions need to be included. To calcu-
late the lifetime of the 8p3/2 state, we need to include ten
E1 transitions and in the case of the 6d3/2 level seven E1
transitions are allowed, including the 6d3/2 −4f5/2 transi-
tion. The experimental energies from [11] are used in the
lifetime calculation. We illustrate the importance of the
diﬀerent channels contributing to the lifetime of the 7p3/2
state in Table V, where we give the coeﬃcients Avw for
each transition together with the transition energies from
[11] and corresponding matrix elements from Tables I-II.
w Avw is listed in the last col-

umn. We ﬁnd the contribution from the 7p3/2 − 5d5/2
transition to be nearly as large as the contribution from
the 7p3/2 − 7s transition. All seven contributions need to
be included in an accurate calculation. The smallest con-
w Avw comes from 7p3/2 − 4d3/2 transition
tribution to
and is around 2%.

P

We list the contributions to 6d3/2 and 6d5/2 lifetimes
as well as the corresponding matrix elements and tran-
sition energies in Table VI. The dominant contributions
to 6d3/2 and 6d5/2 lifetimes come from the 6d3/2 − 5p1/2
and 6d5/2 − 5p3/2 transitions, respectively. The next
largest contribution is 14% for the 6d3/2 lifetime and 7%
for the 6d5/2 lifetime. We ﬁnd the contributions from
6d3/2 − 4f5/2 and 6d5/2 − 4f7/2 transitions to be around
7% for the corresponding level.

P

The results for the ns, np and nd lifetimes obtained
using all-order matrix elements are compared with ex-
perimental values from Refs. [4, 5, 15] in Table VII. We
omit the eﬀect of the blackbody radiation in our calcu-
lations. In Ref. [15], it was estimated to be small for the
levels considered here with the exception of the 8p levels.
It is still far below experimental uncertainty of the 8p
level lifetime. The results agree with experiment within

the experimental precision for 6s, 7s, 8s, 6p, and 4d lev-
els. The values of the 7p, 8p, 5d, and 6d lifetimes are
in good agreement with experiment. The lower accuracy
of the calculations is expected for these levels owing to
the lower accuracy of the np − n′d matrix elements with
comparison to most of the np − n′s ones due to large cor-
relation corrections for these matrix elements. It should
be noted that the experimental uncertainties of 7p, 8p,
and 5d lifetimes are rather large (up to 20%) and two
recent experiments for the 6d3/2 level give substantially

diﬀerent values: 256(4) ns and 298(8) ns. Our result
for 6d3/2 lifetime (263 ns) is very close to the ﬁrst mea-
surement, however, large uncertainties in the correlation
contributions to the relevant transitions do not allow to
rule out 10% larger value of this lifetime.

The accuracy of the theoretical calculations for these
levels may be improved by including some triple-
excitation contributions into the corresponding wave
functions.

We estimate some omitted higher-order contributions
using the scaling of the single excitation coeﬃcients ρmv
described above. The contributions containing these
single-excitation coeﬃcients are dominant for all of the
transitions needed for the calculation of lifetimes in Ta-
ble VII. The lifetimes obtained using scaled all-order
matrix elements are listed in column τ sc
v . We ﬁnd that
the scaled data agree with experimental values within the
experimental uncertainty for all levels with exception of
7p3/2 and 6d3/2, where the theoretical values are just
outside the experimental uncertainties.

where D is the dipole operator.
In this formula, ω is
assumed to be at least several linewidths oﬀ resonance
with the corresponding transition.

The core contribution to the polarizability, calculated
in the DHF approximation is found to be small for Rb
(9.3 a3
0) and is weakly dependent on ω in the frequency
range considered here. The static value for the polariz-
ability of Rb+ calculated in the random-phase approx-
imation (RPA) [16, 17] is 9.1 a3
0, close to the value of
9.0 a3
0 obtained by Johansson [18] from analysis of the
observed term values of nonpenetrating Rydberg states.
The accuracy of the RPA approximation for the core po-
larizability is estimated to be 5 % in Ref. [3]. We use the
RPA value for the core polarizability of Rb+ as a base-
line, and adjust it to account for valence electron (using
Eq.(5) with n′ = 2, 3, 4) and the frequency dependence
by using DHF calculations. The RPA and DHF values
diﬀer by only 2 %. The correction to the core polariz-
ability owing to the presence of the valence electron is
very small, it is only −0.3a3
0 for 5s state in DHF approx-
imation.

First, we describe the calculation of the ground state
polarizability, α5s(ω). The expression (5) converges
rapidly with n′ so the contribution with n′ = 5 is domi-
nant. We use experimental 5s − 5p matrix elements from

[6], all-order matrix elements from Ref. [3], and experi-
mental energies from [11] to evaluate the expression of
Eq. (5) with n′ = 5, 6, 7, 8. The contribution to the
ground state polarizability from states with n′ > 8 is very
small, 0.2a3
0 in DHF approximation. We plot the ground
state frequency-dependent polarizability in the vicinity
of the 5s − 5p1/2 and 5s − 5p3/2 resonances in Fig. 1. The
behavior within the few linewidths from the resonances
is not shown and the exact placement of the resonances
is indicated by the vertical dashed lines. As we see from
Fig. 1, α5s(ω) changes sign between two resonances. We
determined that α5s(ω) = 0 at λvac = 790.032(8) nm
[2], where the uncertainty results from the uncertainty
of the polarizability calculation. This crossing point is
of interest for the optical lattice experiments with Rb as
the atoms will no longer be trapped at this wavelength.
We give the breakdown of the diﬀerent contributions
to the ground state polarizability for one particular fre-
quency, ω = 0.04298 a.u., corresponding to λ = 1.06µm
[19], in Table VIII. The comparison with other theory
[20] and experiment [21] is also given. Our value is in
good agreement with the result from [20]. The discrep-
ancy is due to our use of more accurate values for the
electric-dipole matrix elements. Our result is just out-
side the range of uncertainty of the value α = 769 ± 61 a3
0
inferred by Bonin and Kadar-Kallen from an atomic de-
ﬂection experiment [21].

Next, we describe the calculation of the polarizabilities
of the Rydberg states. We calculate the polarizabilities
of the ns states of Rb with n = 8 . . . 19 using the DHF
approximation; i.e. using DHF values for both energies
and matrix elements in Eq. (5). The summation over n′
in Eq. (1) is truncated at n′ = 23. The DHF calculations
are done on the non-linear grid of the form

r(i) = r0(e(i−1)h − 1).

dberg states can be matched at the point between two
resonances where the ground state polarizability is small
and negative. The exact matching point for the 15s state
is λvac = 790.14(2) nm [2]. The matching of the po-

excited states 500 grid points are suﬃcient. This type of
grid provides a very dense grid near the origin. Thus
we needed to conﬁrm that there were suﬃcient points at
large R to support the Rydberg states. The parameters
r0 and h were chosen to ensure suﬃcient number of points
to calculate hnskDkn′pi matrix elements for high values
of n and n′. However, we found that the accurate DHF
values of the matrix elements even between high Ryd-
berg states can be obtained with relatively small number
of grid points. For example, the values of the 20s−20p3/2
matrix element obtained with 500 and 40000 point grids
(corresponding to approximated 10 and 200 points in the
relevant grid section) diﬀer by only 0.05%. The results of
the DHF calculation for ω=0.0576645 a.u. corresponding
to λ = 790 nm are given in Table IX. We ﬁnd that the
polarizability values do not change substantially with n
for n > 8. We conduct a separate high-precision calcu-
lation of the 8s polarizability using the all-order matrix
elements from Table I. We ﬁnd DHF result to be in good
agreement with the high-precision value.

We plot the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of 8s,
15s, and 20s states in Fig. 2. As expected, the polariz-
abilities depend weakly on ω for the frequencies consid-

V. CONCLUSION

We have conducted a systematic study of the ns − n′p
and nd − n′p electric-dipole matrix elements in rubid-
ium using relativistic all-order method. An investigation
of the accuracy of these matrix elements was performed.
The resulting matrix elements were used to calculate life-
times of the ns and np levels with n = 6, 7, 8 and nd levels
with n = 4, 5, 6. The lifetime values were found to be in
good agreement with experiment. The dynamic polar-
izabilities of the ns Rb states, which are of interest for
the optimization of quantum computation scheme with
neutral atoms mediated by the conditional excitations to
Rydberg states, were also calculated.

We suggest that electron-laser interactions can give rise to resonance phenomena as the intensity
varies. A new QED perturbation theory is developed, in which the coupling between an electron
and the second quantized laser mode is treated nonperturbatively. We predict, for example, the
above-threshold ionization rate shows peaks at intensities with integer ponderomotive parameter.
Such quantum resonance eﬀects may be exploited to calibrate laser intensities in appropriate range.

Introduction

For a radiation ﬁeld, the correspon-
dence principle limit requires a huge number of photons
in unit volume. In accordance to this limit, as is widely
accepted, the light ﬁeld in a high-intensity laser beam can
Indeed many
be treated classically or semi-classically.
aspects of the stimulated electron-laser interactions have
been derived in this way [1]. However, according to quan-
tum electrodynamics (QED), the fundamental theory for
electron-photon interactions, even in this limit the radia-
tion ﬁeld still has particle-like structure in terms of pho-
tons, and stimulated emission and absorption give rise to
strong ﬂuctuations in photon number at high light inten-
sities. The ﬂuctuations are extremely tiny compared to
the total photon number, thus are ignored in the classical
treatments. But their absolute magnitude become appre-
ciable at available high intensities and may give rise to
novel, observable quantum eﬀects.

A physical quantity that can be used to measure the
strength of stimulated electron-laser-photon interactions
is the dimensionless ponderomotive parameter:

Up/¯hω0 = 2πe2I/me¯hcω3
0,

z

≡

(1)

where I is the intensity, and ¯hω0 the laser photon en-
ergy. It is essentially the ponderomotive energy Up for
an electron in the light ﬁeld in units of the photon energy.
Classically, Up is the time-averaged kinetic energy of the
wiggling motion of the electron in response to the ra-
diation ﬁeld. In quantum theory, Eberly ﬁrst showed [2]
the emergence of the parameter z in stimulated Compton
scattering. He interpreted it as the number of photons in
the possibly smallest interaction volume for the electron,
and argued that when z becomes large, many photons at
a time are interacting with the electron, and stimulated
multi-photon coherent emissions and absorptions become
frequent and signiﬁcant. We will argue that it is more
natural to interpret z as the average number of laser-
mode photons in the photon cloud dressing the electron,
whose formation is due to stimulated interactions. Thus,
when the ponderomotive parameter z is close to an in-
teger, the dressing photon cloud becomes resonant with
the laser mode, which has a discrete energy spectrum. In

view of this argument, we suggest that various processes
in the electron-laser system should show resonance-like
structures in their intensity dependence, as the pondero-
motive parameter z becomes close to an integer.

Previously, Guo, ˚Aberg and Crasemann [3] have given
a nonperturbative approach based on almost exact eigen-
states for the system of an electron coupled to a second
quantized laser mode.
It was then used to derive the
above-threshold ionization (ATI) rate, leading to nonva-
nishing results only at z = integer. This was a sort of
precursor of the resonance eﬀects, but it could not pro-
duce nonzero ATI rate at z
= integer. To remedy, in this
paper we develop a new theory for QED at high laser
photon density, by including non-laser radiation modes
and treat their couplings to the electron as perturbation.
In this way we are able to demonstrate the resonant ATI
peaks at z = integer superposed on a smooth backgroud
at non-integral z. This and similar intensity-dependent,
resonating quantum eﬀects of the light ﬁeld in other mul-
tiphoton processes may be experimentally exploited to
calibrate appropriately high laser intensities.

New Perturbation Theory for QED

To properly deal
with photon number ﬂuctuations, we need to quantize the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, but still treat the electron quantum
mechanically, ignoring pair production, vacuum polariza-
tion and other relativistic corrections for the electron as
well, if the laser intensity is not too high.

In the Schr¨odinger picture, the Hamiltonian of the

electron-radiation system is (with ¯h = c = 1)

Now let us separate the laser modes, say a single mode
labeled by k0, from other photon modes: A = Ak0 + A′,
and try to ﬁrst treat the electron-laser-mode interactions
nonperturbatively, then add the coupling of the electron
to non-laser modes as perturbation. Thus, we are led to
split H = H0 + V + V ′, with

For an electron in the laser ﬁeld, we choose H0 + V
as the unperturbed Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of N ′
are simply the Fock states for the non-laser mode. For
the electron-laser-mode subsystem, almost exact eigen-
states has been obtained before [4]- [5], which are la-
beled by a momentum p and an integer n, denoted as
Ψ0
pn. They are the nonrelativstic limit of the exact so-
lutions [4] to the Dirac equation coupled to the quan-
tized laser-mode. They form a complete, orthogonal set
of states, called quantized ﬁeld Volkov states (QFVS),
which are the QED analog of the classical Volkov states
[6]. Their non-relativistic limit is veriﬁed [5] to satisfy
the Schr¨odinger equation up to errors of the same order
of magnitude as relativistic corrections. In practice, we
need only to consider their large photon-number limit,

(8)

The QFVS is a coherent superposition of Fock states
in the laser mode with diﬀerent photon number; this im-
plies that the electron in the laser ﬁeld is dressed by a
coherent photon cloud which has a component in each
Fock state with photon surplus (or deﬁcit) j, generated
by stimulated emission and absorption. We intepret both
the total energy and momentum in eq. (8) as consisting of
contributions from the electron, the background photons,
and the photon cloud, each being on shell. Therefore, it
is natural to interpret the contributions from the photon
cloud as the ponderomotive energy and momentum [7]:

Up = zω0, Pp = zk0,

(9)

and identify the average number of laser photons in the
dressing cloud with the ponderomotive parameter z de-
ﬁned in eq. (1). We emphasize that this interpretation
of the ponderomotive parameter is the distinctive conse-
quence of the exact QFVS solutions, not shared by any
other existing perturbative approaches.

By using the QFVS as unperturbed states, we can
develop a new perturbation theory for the electron-
radiation system, in which the electron-non-laser-mode
coupling V ′ is treated as perturbation. Then the eigen-
state for an electron in the laser ﬁeld is the perturbed

Calculation of the ATI Rate

For deﬁniteness,
let us consider the above-threshold ionization (ATI): A
beam of neutral atoms with tightly bound electrons is in-
jected into a monochromatic, elliptically polarized single-
mode laser beam. Even if the photon energy is much less
than the ionization energy, a bound electron can absorb
simultaneously quite a number of, say ten to twenty, pho-
tons to become ionized with appreciable kinetic energy.
Of course, before the ionized electron gets out of the laser
beam, it has very strong stimulated interactions with the
laser mode. During the ATI process, to balance the total
energy and momentum, the electron may emit a photon
not in the laser mode (spontaneous emission). We want
to calculate the rate and angular distributions etc., and
study their intensity dependence.

Let us start with the following initial state for the elec-
tron-radiation system: the electron in a bound state Φi,
, and the non-laser
the laser mode in the Fock state

modes in the vacuum state (with n′
i = 0 photons), de-

, the electron is in a free state with mo-
as
mentum Pf outside the laser beam, the laser mode in
and at most one, say k′, of the non-laser
the state
(to ﬁrst order). Physically the ATI
modes in
can be viewed as a two-step process [3]: 1) The electron
is ﬁrst ionized into the laser ﬁeld, so the intermediate
state of the system is described by the perturbed QFVS
given by eqs. (6) and (10); 2) The electron exits out of
the laser beam and becomes a free electron.

With this physical picture in mind, we apply the stan-
dard formal theory for scattering [8] and its adaption to
the present situation [3], up to ﬁrst order in perturbation
theory, resulting in the transition amplitude

A careful study shows that the kinetic energy diﬀerence

Resonant ATI Peaks

From eq. (15) one can infer
that the amplitude T3 becomes very large, if z is suﬃ-
ciently close to an integer, because then one of the terms
in the sum can have a very small denominator j′
z.
Thus, we predict that there are resonant ATI peaks at
quantized intensities with z = N or

Note the smooth background away from the resonant
peaks, grossly dictated by the classical description of the

Fig. 1 are rather narrow, for the ATI measurements to
test our theory the laser intensity should be very stable
and adjustable almost continuously.

single-mode, linearly polarized laser at 1064 nm.

where the ﬁnal state is the Volkov state in a classical light
ﬁeld. Unlike our T3, it neither predicts the resonance
peaks nor emission of a non-laser photon ω′.

In the above, as in the usual treatments, we have ig-
nored the eﬀects of the ionic Coulomb interactions, since
the Coulomb matrix elements are of the order e2 while
those of V ′ are of the order e. We have also used the
Fock states as the basis for the laser mode. If one uses
Glauber coherent states to describe the initial and ﬁnal
states of the laser ﬁeld, the ATI amplitude can be easily
derived by superposing our amplitudes. This gives rise
to a spread in photon number ni and nj. But the cor-
responding spread in z is expected to be very small. So
our prediction of the resonant ATI peaks is unaﬀected.

Our ATI rate diverges at exactly integral z. This prob-
lem is easy to remedy, by including in eq.(10) an imagi-
(˜p˜n, 0),
nary part (a ﬁnite width) for the QFVS energy
due to its ability to decay through spontaneous emission
via the coupling V ′ to non-laser modes.

E

Other Intensity-Dependent Quantum Eﬀects

Our
argument for the resonance eﬀects in the electron-laser
system is very general, based only on the intensity de-
pendent stimulated interactions and the discrete photon
structure of the laser mode. So we expect to see them in
other multiphoton processes, and our approach to QED
at high laser photon density is applicable as well.

One example is a slow electron transversing a single-
mode laser beam. Classically, the ponderomotive energy
acts like an eﬀective repulsive potential, so at high in-
tensities the electron can hardly get into the laser beam.
But according to our argument, the stimulated electron-
laser interactions will give rise to a photon cloud dressing
the electron, which can be resonant with the laser mode.
So we predict that when the laser intensity is close to the
quantized values N I0, there will be resonance peaks for
the penetration probability for slow electrons transvers-
ing the laser beam. Our new perturbation theory is ap-
plicable to make quantitative predictions.

It is easy to generalize our approach to more than one
laser modes, since the corresponding QFVS have been
obtained before [10]. For example, one may consider elec-
trons scattered by a standing wave formed by two laser
modes. Previously, Bucksbaum et al. [11] has experimen-
tally discovered a dramatic peak splitting in the angular
distribution of the scattered electron. This has been the-
oretically explained in ref. [12] using the QFVS states,
which could not deal with the angular region inside the
splitting angle. Our new perturbation theory can be em-
ployed to deal with the angular region in between the
peaks, and is expected to reveal a characteristic varia-
tion in the peak separation as I/I0 changes continuously
near an integer.

These and similar intensity-dependent quantum eﬀects
of the light ﬁeld, if veriﬁed, would provide means for
calibrating the intensity of laser beams in the range with
the order of I/I0 from unity to at least few tens.

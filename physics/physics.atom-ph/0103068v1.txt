We present details from a recent test of Lorentz and CPT symmetry using hydrogen masers
[1]. We have placed a new limit on Lorentz and CPT violation of the proton in terms of a recent
standard model extension by placing a bound on sidereal variation of the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1
Zeeman frequency in hydrogen. Here, the theoretical standard model extension is reviewed. The
operating principles of the maser and the double resonance technique used to measure the Zeeman
frequency are discussed. The characterization of systematic eﬀects is described, and the method of
data analysis is presented. We compare our result to other recent experiments, and discuss potential
steps to improve our measurement.

I. INTRODUCTION

A theoretical framework has recently been developed that incorporates Lorentz and CPT symmetry violation
into the standard model and quantiﬁes their eﬀects. [2–14]. One branch of this framework emphasizes low energy,
experimental searches for symmetry violating eﬀects in atomic energy levels [13,14]. In particular, Lorentz and CPT
violation in hydrogen has been examined and sidereal variations in the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency have
been quantiﬁed [15]. Motivated by this work, we have conducted a search for sidereal variation in the hydrogen
Zeeman frequency, and have placed a new clean bound of 10−27 GeV on Lorentz and CPT violation of the proton [1].
Here we provide additional details of the theoretical framework, experiment and analysis. In Sec. II we discuss the
standard model extension. In Sec. III we describe the basic concepts of hydrogen maser operation and our Zeeman
frequency measurement technique. In Sec. IV we describe the procedure used to collect data and extract a sidereal
bound on the Zeeman frequency. In Sec. V we describe eﬀorts to reduce and characterize systematic eﬀects. Finally,
in Sec. VI we compare our result to other clock-comparison tests of Lorentz and CPT symmetry, and discuss potential
means of improving our measurement.

II. LORENTZ AND CPT SYMMETRY VIOLATION IN THE STANDARD MODEL

Experimental investigations of Lorentz symmetry provide important tests of the standard model of particle physics
and general relativity. While the standard model successfully describes particle phenomenology, it is believed to be the
low energy limit of a fundamental theory that incorporates gravity. This underlying theory may be Lorentz invariant,
yet contain spontaneous symmetry-breaking that could result in small violations of Lorentz invariance and CPT at
the level of the standard model.

A theoretical framework has been developed to describe Lorentz and CPT violation at the level of the standard
model by Kosteleck´y and coworkers [2–14]. This standard-model extension is quite general: it emerges as the low-
energy limit of any underlying theory that generates the standard model and contains spontaneous Lorentz symmetry
violation [2–4]. For example, such characteristics might emerge from string theory [5–8]. A key feature of the standard
model extension is that it is formulated at the level of the known elementary particles, and thus enables quantitative
comparison of a wide array of searches for Lorentz and CPT violation [9–12].

“Clock comparison experiments” are searches for temporal variations in atomic energy levels. According to the
standard model extension considered here, Lorentz and CPT violation may produce shifts in certain atomic levels,
whose magnitude depends on the orientation of the atom’s quantization axis relative to a ﬁxed inertial frame [13,14].
Certain atomic transition frequencies, therefore, may exhibit sinusoidal variation as the earth rotates on its axis.
New limits can be placed on Lorentz and CPT violation by bounding sidereal variation of these atomic transition
frequencies.

Speciﬁcally, the description of Lorentz and CPT violation is included in the relativistic Lagrange density of the

constituent particles of the atom. For example, the modiﬁed electron Lagrangian becomes [13]

The parameters aµ, bµ, cµν, dµν , eν, fν, gλµν and Hµν represent possible vacuum expectation values of Lorentz
tensors generated through spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in an underlying theory. These are absent in the
standard model. The parameters aµ, bµ, eν, fν and gλµν represent coupling strengths for terms that violate both
CPT and Lorentz symmetry, while cµν , dµν , and Hµν violate Lorentz symmetry only. An analogous expression exists
for the modiﬁed proton and neutron Lagrangians (a superscript will be appended to diﬀerentiate between the sets
of parameters). The standard model extension treats only the free particle properties of the constituent particles,
estimating that all interaction eﬀects will be of higher order [13]. As a result, the interaction term LQED
is unchanged
from the conventional, Lorentz invariant, QED interaction term.

int

Within this phenomenological framework, the values of these parameters are not calculable; instead, values must
be determined experimentally. The general nature of this theory ensures that diﬀerent experimental searches may
place bounds on diﬀerent combinations of Lorentz and CPT violating terms, while direct comparisons between these
experiments are possible (see Table III and Ref. [13]).

The leading-order Lorentz and CPT violating energy level shifts for a given atom are obtained by summing over the
individual free particle shifts of the atomic constituents. From the symmetry violating correction to the relativistic
Lagrangian, a non-relativistic correction Hamiltonian δh is found using standard ﬁeld theory techniques [13]. Assuming
Lorentz and CPT violating eﬀects to be small, the energy level shifts are calculated perturbatively by taking the
expectation value of the correction Hamiltonian with respect to the unperturbed atomic states, leading to a shift in
an atomic (F, mF ) sublevel given by [13]

∆EF,mF = hF, mF |neδhe + npδhp + nnδhn|F, mF i.

(4)

Here nw is the number of each type of particle and δhw is the corresponding correction Hamiltonian. Note that
for most atoms, the interpretation of energy level shifts in terms of this standard model extension is reliant on the
particular model used to describe the atomic nucleus (e.g., the Schmidt model). One key advantage of a study in
hydrogen is the simplicity of the nuclear structure (a single proton), with its results uncompromised by any nuclear
model uncertainty.

Among the most recent clock comparison experiments are Penning trap tests by Dehmelt and co-workers with the
electron and positron [16,17] which place a limit on electron Lorentz and CPT violation at 10−25 GeV. A recent
re-analysis by Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, and co-workers of existing data from the “E¨ot-Wash II” spin-polarized
torsion pendulum [18,19] has improved this to a level of 10−29 GeV [20], the most stringent bound to date on Lorentz
and CPT violation of the electron. A new limit on neutron Lorentz and CPT violation has been placed at 10−31 GeV
by Bear et al. [21] using a dual species noble gas maser and comparing Zeeman frequencies of 129Xe and 3He. The
current limit on Lorentz and CPT violation of the proton is 10−27 GeV, as derived from an experiment by Lamoreaux
and Hunter [22] which compared Zeeman frequencies of 199Hg and 133Cs.

Figure 1 shows the Lorentz and CPT violating corrections to the energy levels of the ground state of hydrogen [15].

The subscripts denote the projection of the tensor couplings onto the laboratory frame. Therefore, as the earth
rotates relative to a ﬁxed inertial frame, the Zeeman frequency νZ will exhibit a sidereal variation. We have recently
published the result of a search for this variation of the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency in hydrogen using
hydrogen masers [1]. This search has placed a new, clean bound on Lorentz and CPT violation of the proton at a
level of 10−27 GeV.

III. HYDROGEN MASER CONCEPTS

The electronic ground state in hydrogen is split into four levels by the hyperﬁne interaction, labeled (following
the notation of Andresen [24]) |1i to |4i in order of decreasing energy (Fig. 1). The energies of atoms in |1i and
|2i decrease as the magnetic ﬁeld decreases; these are therefore low-ﬁeld seeking states. Conversely, |3i and |4i are
high-ﬁeld seeking states. In low ﬁelds, |2i and |4i are only dependent on magnetic ﬁeld in second order. The maser
oscillates on the |2i ↔ |4i transition (ﬁeld-independent to ﬁrst-order). This transition frequency, as a function of
static ﬁeld, is given by ν24 = νhf s + 2750B2 (ν in Hz with B in Gauss, with νhf s ≈ 1420.405751 MHz the zero-
ﬁeld hyperﬁne frequency). Hydrogen masers typically operate with low static ﬁelds (less than 1 mG), where ν24 is
shifted from νhf s by about 3 mHz, or 2 parts in 1012. The two F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequencies are given
by ν12 = 1.4 × 106B − 1375B2 and ν23 = 1.4 × 106B + 1375B2. At B = 1 mG these are nearly degenerate, with
ν12 − ν23 ≈ 3 mHz, much less than the Zeeman linewidth of approximately 1 Hz.

A. Maser operation

In a hydrogen maser [25–27], molecular hydrogen is dissociated in an rf discharge and a beam of hydrogen atoms
is formed, as shown in Fig. 2. A hexapole state selecting magnet focuses the low-ﬁeld-seeking hyperﬁne states |1i
and |2i into a quartz maser bulb at about 1012 atoms/sec. Inside the bulb (volume ∼ 103 cm3), the atoms travel
ballistically for about 1 second before escaping, making ∼ 104 collisions with the bulb wall. A Teﬂon coating reduces
the atom-wall interaction and thus inhibits decoherence of the masing atomic ensemble by wall collisions. The maser
bulb is centered inside a cylindrical TE011 microwave cavity resonant with the 1420 MHz hyperﬁne transition. The
microwave ﬁeld stimulates a small, coherent magnetization in the atomic ensemble, and this magnetization acts as
a source to stimulate the microwave ﬁeld. With suﬃciently high atomic ﬂux and low cavity losses, this feedback
induces active maser oscillation. The maser signal is inductively coupled out of the microwave cavity and ampliﬁed
with an external receiver. Surrounding the cavity, a solenoid produces the weak static magnetic ﬁeld (≈ 1 mG) that
establishes the quantization axis inside the maser bulb and sets the Zeeman frequency (≈ 1 kHz). A pair of Helmholtz
coils produces the oscillating transverse magnetic ﬁeld that drives the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman transitions. The
cavity, solenoid, and Zeeman coils are all enclosed within several layers of high permeability magnetic shielding.

A well engineered hydrogen maser can have fractional stabilities approaching 10−15 over intervals of hours. This
stability is enabled by a long atom-ﬁeld interaction time (1 s), a low atom-wall interaction (due to the low atomic
polarizability of H and the wall’s Teﬂon coating), reduced Doppler eﬀects (the atoms are conﬁned to a region of
uniform microwave ﬁeld phase, eﬀectively averaging their velocity to zero over the interaction time with the ﬁeld),
and multiple layers of thermal control of the cavity (stabilizing cavity pulling shifts).

B. Maser characterization

Among the quantities used to characterize a hydrogen maser, those most relevant to this experiment are the atomic
line-Q Ql, the population decay rate γ1, the hyperﬁne decoherence rate γ2, the atomic ﬂow rate into and out of the
bulb γb, and the maser Rabi frequency |X24|. We describe here a comprehensive set of measurements to characterize
hydrogen maser P-8. The results discussed here are summarized in Table I. Our Lorentz and CPT symmetry test
data were taken with a similar but newer hydrogen maser, P-28 [28]. A few of the maser characterization parameters
for P-28, while not directly measured, have been inferred using ﬁtting parameters from the double resonance method
used to measure the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency, described in Sec. IV A. These values are included in Table
I in italics.

To determine these parameters of an operating H maser, the cavity volume VC , bulb volume Vb, cavity quality
factor QC , ﬁlling factor η, and output coupling coeﬃcient β must be known. For both masers, VC = 1.4 × 10−2 m3,
Vb = 2.9 × 10−3 m3, QC ≈ 40,000, and β = 0.23 [29]. The ﬁlling factor, deﬁned as [26]

quantiﬁes the ratio of average magnetic ﬁeld energy inside the bulb to the average magnetic ﬁeld energy in the cavity.
This has a value of η = 2.14 for masers P-8 and P-28 [29].

TABLE I. Maser characterization parameters. The italicized values for P-28 were inferred from double resonance ﬁt param-

this section.

For canonical hydrogen maser operation, there are two important relaxation rates [27,29]. For a room temperature

H maser, the decay of the population inversion is described by the longitudinal relaxation rate

and the decay of the atomic coherence is described by the transverse relaxation rate

γ1 = γb + γr + 2γse + γ′
1,

γ2 = γb + γr + γse + γ′
2.

Here, γb is the atomic ﬂow rate into the bulb, γr is the rate of recombination into molecular hydrogen at the bulb wall,
γse is the hydrogen-hydrogen spin-exchange decay rate, and γ′
i includes all other sources of decay, such as decoherence
during wall collisions and eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld gradients.

In the steady state, the atom ﬂow rate into the bulb is equal to the geometric escape rate from the bulb, given by
γb = ¯vA/4KVb, where ¯v = 2.5 ×105 cm/s is the mean thermal velocity of atoms in the bulb, A = 0.254 cm3 is the
area of the bulb entrance aperture, and K ≈ 6 is the Klausing factor [30]. Thus, γb = 0.86 rad/s for both P-8 and
P-28. The spin exchange decay rate is given approximately by [27,29]

1
2
where ¯vr = 3.6 ×105 cm/s is the mean relative velocity of atoms in the bulb and σ = 21 × 10−16 cm2 is the
hydrogen-hydrogen spin-exchange cross section. The hydrogen density is given by [27,29]

γse =

(9)

where Itot is the total ﬂux of hydrogen atoms into the storage bulb.

The atomic line-Q is related to the transverse relaxation rate and the maser oscillation frequency ω by [26,29]

It is measured using the cavity pulling of the maser frequency: neglecting spin-exchange shifts, the maser frequency
is given by [26]

By measuring the maser frequency as a function of cavity frequency setting, the line-Q can be determined. For both
P-8 and P-28, we ﬁnd Ql = 1.6 × 109, and therefore γ2 = 2.8 rad/s.

A convenient single measure of spin-exchange-independent relaxation in a hydrogen maser is given by “gamma-t”

[27,29]

Using this, a more useful form for the longitudinal relaxation rate, γ1, can be found. By combining Eqn. 13 with
Eqns. 7 and 8, we ﬁnd

Using Eqns. 8-11, we can relate the line-Q to I, the input ﬂux of atoms in state |2i as [29]

using the threshold ﬂux required for maser oscillation (neglecting spin-exchange)

and the maser quality parameter

The ratio I/Itot is a measure of the eﬀectiveness of the state selection of atoms entering the bulb. While I is not

directly measurable, it can be related to the power P radiated by the atoms by [27,29]

where Pc = ¯hωIth/2. The maser power is also related to the maser Rabi frequency by [27]

The power coupled out of the maser is given by [29] Po/P = β/(1 + β).

Generally, the parameter q is less than 0.1, while I/Ith is approximately 2 or 3. Hence, the ﬁrst term of Eqn. 18
2, then we can rewrite

can be neglected relative to the others. If we make the reasonable approximation that γ′

Therefore, by measuring the line-Q as a function of maser power and extracting the slope m and the y-intercept b,
we can determine q and γt. For maser P-8, q = 0.100 and γt = 1.83 rad/s.

With these values of q and γt, we found Ith = 0.54 × 1012 atoms/s (using Eqn. 16), and Pc = 250 fW. With a
measured output power of Po = 112 fW, the atoms were radiating P = 599 fW, and the ﬂux of state |2i atoms was
I = 3.13 × 1012 atoms/s (Eqn. 18). Under the assumption that γt ≈ γb + γr we found that the total ﬂux was Itot =
15.0 × 1012 atoms/s (Eqn. 17) and the density was n = 2.8 × 1015 atoms/m3 (Eqn. 10). The spin-exchange decay
rate was then found to be γse = 1.06 rad/s (Eqn. 9). Finally, the population decay rate was γ1 = 4.04 rad/s (Eqn.
14) and the maser Rabi frequency was |X24| = 2.77 rad/s (Eqn. 19).

C. Zeeman frequency determination

The F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency is measured using a double resonance technique [24,31,32]. As the
frequency of an audio frequency magnetic ﬁeld ωZ, applied perpendicular to the quantization axis, is swept through
the Zeeman frequency, a shift in the maser frequency is observed (Fig. 3). When the applied ﬁeld is near the Zeeman
frequency, two-photon transitions (one audio photon plus one microwave photon) link states |1i and |3i to state |4i,
in addition to the single microwave photon transition between states |2i and |4i. This two photon coupling shifts the
maser frequency antisymmetrically with respect to the detuning of the applied ﬁeld about the Zeeman resonance [32].
To second order in the Rabi frequency of the applied Zeeman ﬁeld, |X12| the small static-ﬁeld limit of the maser

frequency shift from the unperturbed frequency is given by [24]

frequency, K = 1
33 = γb/(2γ1) is the steady state population diﬀerence between states
|1i and |3i in the absence of the applied Zeeman ﬁeld. The ﬁrst term in Eqn. 23 results from the coherent two-photon
mixing of the F = 1 levels as described above [32], while the second term is a modiﬁed cavity pulling term that results
from the reduced line-Q in the presence of the applied Zeeman ﬁeld. We compared Eqn. 23 to experimental data
from P-8, inserting the independently measured values of |X 0
24|, γb, γ1, and γ2. By matching the ﬁt to the data we
extracted the Zeeman ﬁeld parameters |X12| and γZ shown in Fig. 3.

11 − ρ0

In addition to the shift given by Eqn. 23, there is a small symmetric frequency shift due to the slight non-degeneracy
of the two F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequencies. This term oﬀsets the zero crossing of the maser shift resonance
away from the average Zeeman frequency 1
2 (ν12 + ν23), however the contribution is negligible at small static ﬁelds.
Also, a reanalysis of the double resonance maser shift [31], which included the eﬀects of spin-exchange collisions [33],
showed that there is an additional hydrogen density-dependent oﬀset of the zero crossing of the maser shift resonance
from the average Zeeman frequency. Using the full spin-exchange corrected formula for the maser frequency shift [31],
we calculated this oﬀset and found that for typical hydrogen maser densities (n ≈ 3 ×1015 m−3), the oﬀset varied
with average maser power as approximately -50 µHz/fW (assuming a linear relation between maser power and atomic
density of ∆P
3×1015 m−3 ). As described below, our masers typically have sidereal power ﬂuctuations less than 1
fW, making this eﬀect negligible.

∆n ≈

100 f W

The applied Zeeman ﬁeld also acts to diminish the maser power, as shown in Fig. 4, and to decrease the maser’s
line-Q. By driving the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman transitions, the applied ﬁeld depletes the population of the upper
masing state |2i, thereby diminishing the number of atoms undergoing the maser transition and reducing the maser
power. Also, by decreasing the lifetime of atoms in state |2i, the line-Q is reduced. A very weak Zeeman ﬁeld of
about 35 nG (as was used in our Lorentz symmetry test) decreases the maser power by less than 2% on resonance and
reduces the line-Q by 2% (as calculated using Eqn. 6 of [24]). The standard method of determining the average static
magnetic ﬁeld strength is to scan the Zeeman resonance with a large applied ﬁeld and record the power diminishment
(such as that shown in Fig. 4, open circles). From the applied ﬁeld frequency at the center of the power resonance,
which typically has a width of about 1 Hz, the magnetic ﬁeld can be found with a resolution of about 1 µG.

FIG. 3. Double resonance maser frequency shifts. The large open circles (maser P-8) are compared with Eqn. 23 (full curve)
using the parameter values shown. The values of |X12| and γZ were chosen to ﬁt the data, while the remaining parameters
were independently measured as described in subsection III B. The experimental error of each measurement (about 40 µHz) is
smaller than the circle marking it. The solid square data points are data from the Lorentz symmetry test (maser P-28). The
large variation of maser frequency with Zeeman detuning near resonance, along with the excellent maser frequency stability,
allows the Zeeman frequency (≈ 800 Hz) to be determined to 3 mHz in a single resonance (requiring 18 minutes of data
acquisition). The inversion of the shift between the two is due to the fact that for the P-8 data (open circles), the maser
operated with an input ﬂux of |2i and |3i atoms, while for the P-28 data (solid points), the typical input of |1i and |2i atoms
was used. Changing between these two input ﬂux modes is done by inverting the direction of the static solenoid ﬁeld, while
maintaining a ﬁxed quantization axis for the state selecting hexapole magnet (see Sec. IV D).

FIG. 4. Double resonance maser power diminishment. The open circles, taken with an applied Zeeman ﬁeld strength of
about 560 nG, represent typical data used to determine the value of the static magnetic ﬁeld in the maser bulb. The ﬁlled
circles are maser power curves with an applied ﬁeld strength of about 80 nG. Our Lorentz symmetry test data were taken with
a ﬁeld strength of about 35 nG, where the power diminishment is less than 2%.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

A. Zeeman frequency measurement

To measure the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency, we applied an oscillating ﬁeld of about 35 nG near the
Zeeman frequency. This ﬁeld shifted the maser frequency by a few mHz (at the extrema), a fractional shift of about 2
parts per trillion. Because of the excellent fractional maser stability (2 parts in 1014 over our averaging times of 10 s),
the shift was easily resolved (see the solid data in Fig. 3). As the frequency of the applied ﬁeld was stepped through the
Zeeman resonance, the maser frequency (of perturbed maser P-28) was compared to a second, unperturbed hydrogen
maser frequency (P-13). The two maser signals at ≈ 1420 MHz were phase locked to independent voltage controlled
crystal oscillator receivers. The exact value of the receivers’ outputs were set by tunable synthesizers, which were set
such that there was a 1.2 Hz oﬀset between them. The two receiver outputs were combined in a heterodyne mixer
and the resulting 0.8 s period beat note was averaged for 10 s (about 12 periods) with a Hewlett-Packard Model HP
5334B frequency counter. The full double resonance spectrum consisted of 100 such points. For each spectrum, 80%
of the points were taken over the middle 40% of the scan range, where the frequency shift varies the most.

Once an entire spectrum of beat period vs applied Zeeman frequency was obtained, it was ﬁt to the function

to determine the Zeeman frequency. Here δ = ν − νZ is the Zeeman detuning of the applied ﬁeld ν away from the
Zeeman frequency νZ , κ = A4/(A1 + δ2) is the analog of the parameter K from Eqn. 23, and τ = (1.403 × 10−9) × ν2
Z
is the small diﬀerence between the two Zeeman frequencies ν12 and ν23. The ﬁrst term A0 is the constant oﬀset
representing the unperturbed beat period between the two masers. The second and third terms comprise the ﬁrst-
order symmetric maser shift (not included in Eqn. 23 but described in the text above); these two terms nearly cancel
at low static ﬁeld where τ vanishes. The ﬁnal two terms account for the two shifts given in Eqn. 23.

For our spectra in maser P-28 with small applied ﬁeld amplitude (solid square data points of Fig. 3), typical ﬁt
parameters were: A0 = 0.84550 ± 0.00001, A1 = 0.141 ± 0.005, νZ = 857.063 ± 0.003, A3 = 0.006 ± 0.010, A4 =
0.029 ± 0.003, A5 = (3.2 ± 0.1) ×10−4, and A6 = (-1 ± 5) ×10−6. The uncertainty in the Zeeman frequency was 3
mHz. Also, A3 and A6, the amplitude coeﬃcients of the residual ﬁrst order eﬀect and the cavity pulling term, were
consistent with zero.

With our known value of γb = 0.86 rad/s, and our measured value of γ2 = 2.77 rad/s (from line-Q), the above set
of ﬁt parameters were consistent with the reasonable values X 0
24 = 2.14 rad/s, γZ = 2.36 rad/s, γ1 = 2.88 rad/s, and
X12 = 0.40 rad/s (since A3 had such a large error bar, the value of X12 was chosen such the ratio of the maser shift
amplitude in P-28 to P-8, shown in Fig. 3, is equal to the ratio of the squares of X12 for P-28 to P-8).

To determine the number of points and length of averaging that optimized the Zeeman frequency resolution,
we recorded several spectra with 50, 100, and 150 points at 5 s and 10 s averaging. We also varied the “density
distribution” of points, including spectra where the middle 40% of the scan contained 80% of the points and those
where the middle 30% contained 80% of the points (thus increasing the number of points in the region where the
antisymmetric shift varies the most). With each of these spectra, we ran the following Monte Carlo analysis [34]:
after ﬁtting each scan to Eqn. 24, we constructed 100 synthetic data sets by adding Gaussian noise to the ﬁt, with
noise amplitude determined by the unperturbed maser frequency resolution of about 40 µHz. Each of these synthetic
data sets was ﬁt and a histogram of the ﬁtted Zeeman frequencies was constructed. The resolution of each spectrum
was taken as the width of the Gaussian curve that ﬁt the histogram (see Fig. 5). As the total length of the scans
increased, the resolution improved and converged to a limit of around 2.5 mHz. While the resolution improved slowly
with increased acquisition time, it would have eventually begun to degrade due to long term drifting of the Zeeman
frequency. (As will be described below, we found that the Zeeman frequency exhibited slow drifts of about 10-100
mHz/day). We therefore chose a scan of 100 points at 10 s averaging, for a total length of about 18 minutes for
our Lorentz symmetry test spectra. The results from the Monte Carlo analysis for one of these spectra indicated a
Zeeman frequency resolution is 2.7 mHz (see Fig. 5).

Our net result combines data from three runs. During each data run, the 18 minute Zeeman frequency scans were
automated and run consecutively. After every 10 scans, 20 minutes of “unperturbed” maser frequency stability data
was taken to track the maser’s stability. Each run contained about 10 continuous days worth of data, and each set
contained more than 500 Zeeman frequency measurements, taken at ≈ 18 minute intervals.
For each run, the long term Zeeman frequency data was ﬁt to a function of the form

f it = (piecewise continuous linear function) + δνZ ,α cos(ωsid t ) + δνZ ,β sin(ωsid t )

where δνZ,α and δνZ,β represent the cosine and sine components of the sidereal sinusoid. The time origin of the
sinusoids for all three runs was taken as midnight (00:00) of November 19, 1999. The subscripts α and β refer to
two non-rotating orthogonal axes perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth. The total sidereal amplitude was
determined by adding δνZ,α and δνZ,β in quadrature. During each run, the Zeeman frequency drifted hundreds of
mHz over tens of days. The piecewise continuous linear function, consisting of segments one sidereal day in length,
was included to account for these long term Zeeman frequency drifts. This function was continuous at each break,
while the derivative was discontinuous.

The result of this analysis, where the ﬁtting function (Eqn. 25) was applied to the full data set, was found to be in
good agreement with a second analysis, where each individual day of data was ﬁt to a line plus the sidereal sinusoid
and the cosine and sine amplitudes of each day were averaged separately and then combined in quadrature to ﬁnd
the total sidereal amplitude.

The cumulative data from the ﬁrst run (November 1999) are shown in Fig. 6(a) and the residuals from the complete
ﬁt (Eqn. 25) are shown in Fig. 6(b). The data set consisted of 11 full days of data and had an overall drift of about
250 mHz.

To avoid a biased choice of ﬁtting, we allowed the location of the slope discontinuities in the piecewise continuous
linear function to shift throughout a sidereal day. We made eight separate ﬁts, each with the location of the slope
discontinuities shifted by three sidereal hours. The total sidereal amplitude and reduced chi square for each is shown
in Fig. 7. We chose our result from the ﬁt with minimum reduced chi square.

TABLE II. Sidereal amplitudes from all runs.

As noted above, the error bar on a single Zeeman frequency determination was about 3 mHz. However, when
analyzing a smooth region of long term Zeeman data (about 1 day) we calculate a standard deviation of about 5 mHz.
We believe this error bar is due mainly to residual thermal ﬂuctuations (see Fig. 14).

For our choice of slope discontinuity with minimum reduced chi square [35], the cosine amplitude was 0.43 mHz ±
0.36 mHz, and the sine amplitude was -0.21 mHz ± 0.36 mHz. The total sidereal amplitude was therefore 0.48 mHz
± 0.36 mHz.

D. Field-inverted runs 2 and 3

In runs 2 and 3, the static solenoid ﬁeld orientation was opposite that of the initial run to further study the double
resonance technique and any potential systematics associated with the solenoid ﬁeld. With the static ﬁeld inverted,
and therefore directed opposite the quantization axis in the state selecting hexapole magnet, the input ﬂux consists
of atoms in states |2i and |3i (rather than the states |1i and |2i). Thus, reversing the ﬁeld inverts the steady state
population diﬀerence (ρ0
33) of Eqn. 23 and acts to invert the antisymmetric double resonance maser frequency
shift [32].

11 − ρ0

Operating the maser in the ﬁeld reversed mode degrades the maser performance and subsequently the Zeeman
frequency data. With opposed quantization ﬁelds inside the maser bulb and at the exit of the state selecting hexapole
magnet, a narrow region of ﬁeld inversion is created. Where the ﬁeld passes through zero, Majorana transitions
between the diﬀerent mF sublevels of the F = 1 manifold can occur. This can alter the number of atoms in the
upper maser state (F = 1, mF = 0, state |2i), which diminishes the overall maser amplitude and stability. In the
ﬁeld-inverted conﬁguration, the maser amplitude was reduced by 30%, and both the maser frequency and Zeeman
frequency were less stable. In addition, the ﬁeld-inverted runs were each conducted soon after a number of rather
invasive repairs were made to the maser [28]. Thus, the quality of the latter two data sets was somewhat degraded
from the ﬁrst run (see Figs. 8(a) and 9(a)). The overall drift was larger (nearly 800 mHz over about 10 days), and
the scatter in the data was increased, as can be seen from the residual plots from these runs (Figs. 8(b) and 9(b))
which have been plotted on the same scale as the residuals from the ﬁrst run (Fig. 6(b)).

The latter two runs were also less suitable for the piecewise continuous linear drift model used in the ﬁrst run. In
that case, the large slope changes were coincidentally separated by an integer number of sidereal days; in the last two
runs, the larger and more frequent changes in slope were not. Therefore, only certain selected sections could be ﬁt to
the same model (Eqn. 25), signiﬁcantly truncating the data sets. Due to all of these factors, the sidereal amplitudes
and the associated error bars were up to an order of magnitude larger for the ﬁeld-inverted runs than the ﬁrst run.
All values are shown together in Table II.

E. Combined result

The ﬁnal sidereal bound, combining all three runs, was calculated using the data in Table II. First, the weighted
averages of the cosine and sine amplitudes, ¯δνZ,α and ¯δνZ,β, were found using the standard formula for weighted
mean [36]

The sign reversal due to the ﬁeld inversion was accounted for in the raw data, before the data were ﬁt. Thus, the runs
are combined using conventional (i.e., additive) averaging. The ﬁnal sidereal amplitude A was calculated by adding

the mean cosine and sine amplitudes in quadrature, A =
F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency of hydrogen of A = 0.49 ± 0.34 mHz.

q
We note that since we are measuring an amplitude, and therefore a strictly positive quantity, this result is consistent
with no sidereal variation at the 1-sigma level: in the case where ¯δνZ,α and ¯δνZ,β have zero mean value and the same
variance σ, the probability distribution for A takes the form P (A) = Aσ−2 exp(−A2/2σ2), which has the most
probable value occurring at A = σ.

In addition to our automated acquisition of Zeeman frequency data, we continuosly monitored the maser’s external
environment. At every ten second step, in addition to applied frequency and maser beat period, we recorded room
temperature, maser cabinet temperature, solenoid current, maser power, ambient magnetic ﬁeld, and active Helmholtz
coil current (see Sec. V A).

V. ERROR ANALYSIS

A. Magnetic systematics

The F = 1, mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency depends to ﬁrst-order on the z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
storage bulb. Thus, all external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations must be suﬃciently screened to enable a sensitivity to shifts from
Lorentz and CPT symmetry violation. The maser cavity and bulb are therefore surrounded by a set of four nested
magnetic shields that reduce the ambient ﬁeld by a factor of about 32,000. We measure unshielded ﬂuctuations in
the ambient ﬁeld of about 3 mG (peak-peak) during the day, and even when shielded, these add signiﬁcant noise to
a single Zeeman scan, as illustrated in Fig. 11(a). Furthermore, the amplitude of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations is signiﬁcantly
reduced late at night, which could generate a diurnal systematic eﬀect in our data.

To reduce the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations in the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, we installed an active feedback system (see
Fig. 10) consisting of two pairs of large Helmholtz coils (2.4 m diameter). The ﬁrst pair of coils (50 turns) produced
a uniform ﬁeld that cancelled most of the z-component of the ambient ﬁeld, leaving a residual ﬁeld of around 5 mG.
A magnetometer probe that sensed the residual ambient ﬁeld was placed partially inside the maser’s magnetic shields
near the maser cavity. This probe had a sensitivity of s = 1.7 mG/V. Due to its location partially inside the magnetic
shields, the probe was screened by a factor of about six from external ﬁelds, reducing the sensitivity to s′ = 0.3 mG/V,
and producing a diﬀerential screening of 5300 between the magnetometer probe and the atoms. The magnetometer
output was passed into a PID servo (Linear Research model LR-130), which contained a proportional stage (gain G
= 33), an integral stage (time constant Ti = 0.1 s) and a derivative stage (time constant = 0.01 s). The correction
voltage was applied to the second pair of Helmholtz coils (3 turns) which produced a uniform ﬁeld (p = 14 mG/V)
along the z-axis to nullify the residual ﬁeld and actively counter any ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Neglecting the small eﬀect of
the derivative stage, the overall time constant of this system was given by τ = Ti(1 + s′/pG) ≈ 0.1 s, about 100 times
shorter than the averaging time of our maser frequency shift measurements (10 s).

With this system we were able to further reduce ambient ﬁeld ﬂuctuations at the magnetometer by a factor of 3,000.
The resulting unshielded ﬂuctuations were less than 1 µG peak-peak. The ﬁeld recorded by the partially screened
magnetometer probe is shown in Fig. 12. The noise on a single Zeeman scan was reduced below our Zeeman frequency
resolution, as shown in Fig. 11(b). During our Lorentz symmetry test, we monitored the ﬁeld at the magnetometer
probe and placed a bound of ∼ 5 nG on the sidereal component of the variation. This corresponds to a shift of
less than 0.2 µHz on the hydrogen Zeeman frequency, three orders of magnitude smaller than the sidereal Zeeman
frequency bound measured.

The magnetometer [37] used in the feedback loop was a ﬂuxgate magnetometer probe (RFL industries Model 101)
which consisted of two parallel high-permeability magnetic cores each surrounded by an excitation coil (the excitation
coils were wound in the opposite sense of each other). A separate pickup coil was wound around the pair of cores.
An AC current (about 2.5 kHz) in the excitation coils drove the cores into saturation, and, in the presence of any
slowly varying external magnetic ﬁeld oriented along the magnetic cores’ axes, an EMF was generated in the pickup

∼ 5 mG of the z-component of the ambient ﬁeld. This residual ﬁeld, detected with a ﬂuxgate magnetometer probe, was actively
cancelled by a servoloop and a second pair of Helmholtz coils (3 turns). The servoloop consisted of a proportional stage (gain
= 33), and integral stage (time constant = 0.1 s) and a derivative stage (time constant = 0.01, not shown). The overall time
constant of the loop was about τ = 0.1 s.

FIG. 12. Residual ambient magnetic ﬁeld, after cancellation by the active Helmholtz control loop, sensed at the magnetometer
probe. Each point is a 10 s average. These three days worth of data depict a Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, with the time origin
corresponding to 00:00 Sunday. From these data it can be seen that for three hours every night the magnetic noise dies out
dramatically, and that the noise level is signiﬁcantly lower on weekends than weekdays. Nevertheless, with the active feedback
system even the largest ﬂuctuations (1 µG peak-peak) causes changes in the Zeeman frequency well below our sensitivity

coil at the second and higher harmonics of the excitation frequency. The magnitude of the time-averaged EMF was
proportional to the external ﬁeld. The probe had a sensitivity of approximately 1 nG.

Any Lorentz violating spin-orientation dependence of the energy of the electrons in the magnetic cores would induce
a sidereal variation in the cores’ magnetization and could generate, or mask, a sidereal variation in the hydrogen
Zeeman frequency through the feedback circuit. However, based on the latest bound on electron Lorentz violation
[18] (10−29 GeV), the Lorentz violating shift would be less than 10−11 G, far below the level of residual ambient ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations. Also, the additional shielding factor of 5300 between the probe and the atoms further reduced the eﬀect
of any Lorentz violating shift in the probe electrons’ energies.

With the ambient ﬁeld kept nearly constant near zero, the Zeeman frequency was set by the magnetic ﬁeld generated
by the solenoid, and hence by the solenoid current. We monitored solenoid current ﬂuctuations by measuring the
voltage across the current-setting 5 kΩ resistor with a 5 1/2 digit multimeter (Fluke model 8840A/AF). By measuring
the Zeeman frequency shift caused by large current changes, we found a dependence of around 10 mHz/nA. When
acquiring Lorentz symmetry test data, we measured long term drifts in the current of about 5 nA (see Fig. 13),
signiﬁcant enough to produce detectable shifts in the Zeeman frequency. Thus, we subtracted these directly from
the Zeeman data. We measured a sidereal variation of 25 ± 10 pA on the solenoid current, corresponding to a
sidereal variation of 0.16 ± 0.08 mHz on the Zeeman frequency correction. This systematic uncertainty in the Zeeman
frequency was included in the net error analysis, as described in Sec. V C.

The maser resided in a closed, temperature stabilized room where the temperature oscillated with a peak-peak
amplitude of slightly less than 0.5˚C with a period of around 15 minutes. The maser was contained in an insulated
and thermally controlled cabinet, which provided a factor of ﬁve to ten shielding from the room, and reduced the
ﬂuctuations to less than 0.1˚C peak-peak, as shown in Fig. 14. By making large changes in the maser cabinet

FIG. 13. Solenoid current during the ﬁrst data run. Each point is an average over one full Zeeman frequency measurement
(18 mins). Since the Zeeman frequency is directly proportional to the solenoid current, we subtracted these solenoid current
drifts directly from the raw Zeeman data, using a measured calibration. We ﬁnd a sidereal component of 25 ± 10 pA to that
correction, corresponding to a signal of 0.16 ± 0.08 mHz on the Zeeman frequency. This systematic uncertainty has been
included in our overall error analysis.

mHz/˚C. We believe this frequency shift was due mainly to the resistors which set the solenoid current, which had
100 ppm/˚C temperature coeﬃcients. We monitored the cabinet temperature and placed a bound on the sidereal
component of the temperature ﬂuctuations at 0.5 mK, which would produce a systematic sidereal variation of 100
µHz on the Zeeman frequency, about a factor of 3 smaller than the measured limit on sidereal variation in Zeeman
frequency.

As mentioned in Sec. III C, spin-exchange eﬀects induce a small oﬀset of the Zeeman frequency given by Eqn. 23
from the actual Zeeman frequency [31]. This would imply that ﬂuctuations in the input atomic ﬂux (and therefore
the maser power) could cause ﬂuctuations in the Zeeman frequency measurement. We measured a limit on the shift
of the Zeeman frequency due to large changes in average maser power at less than 0.8 mHz/fW. (Expected shifts from
spin-exchange are ten times smaller than this level (Sec. III C). We believe the measured limit is related to heating
of the maser as the ﬂux is increased). During long-term operation, the average maser power drifted approximately 1
fW/day (see Fig. 15). The sidereal component of the variations of the maser power were less than 0.05 fW, implying
a variation in the Zeeman frequency of less than 40 µHz, an order of magnitude smaller than our experimental bound
for sidereal Zeeman frequency variation.

We measured systematic errors in sidereal Zeeman frequency variation (as described in Secs. V A and V B) due
to ambient magnetic ﬁeld (0.2 µHz), solenoid ﬁeld (80 µHz), maser cabinet temperature (100 µHz), and hydrogen
density induced spin-exchange shifts (40 µHz). Combining these errors in quadrature with the 0.34 mHz statistical
uncertainty in Zeeman frequency variation, we ﬁnd a sidereal variation of the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency
in hydrogen of 0.44 ± 0.37 mHz at the 1-σ level. This 0.37 mHz bound corresponds to 1.5 × 10−27 GeV in energy
units.

the net error analysis.

FIG. 16. Coordinate systems used. The (X,Y,Z) set refers to a ﬁxed reference frame, and the (x,y,z) set refers to the
laboratory frame. The lab frame is tilted from the ﬁxed Z-axis by our co-latitude, and it rotates about Z as the earth rotates.
The α and β axes, described in Sec. IV, span a plane parallel to the X-Y plane.

VI. DISCUSSION

A. Transformation to ﬁxed frame

Our experimental bound of 0.37 mHz on sidereal variation of the hydrogen Zeeman frequency may be interpreted in
terms of Eqn. 5 as a bound on vector and tensor components of the standard model extension. To make meaningful
comparisons to other experiments, we transform our result into a ﬁxed reference frame. Following the construction in
reference [13], we label the ﬁxed frame with coordinates (X,Y,Z) and the laboratory frame with coordinates (x,y,z),
as shown in Fig. 16. We select the earth’s rotation axis as the ﬁxed Z axis, (declination = 90 degrees). We then deﬁne
ﬁxed X as declination = right ascension = 0 degrees, and ﬁxed Y as declination = 0 degrees, right ascension = 90
degrees. With this convention, the X and Y axes lie in the plane of the earth’s equator. Note that the α, β axes of
Sec. IV E, also in the earth’s equatorial plane, are rotated about the earth’s rotation axis from the X,Y axes by an
angle equivalent to the right ascension of 71◦ 7’ longitude at 00:00 of November 19, 1999.

For our experiment, the quantization axis (which we denote z) was vertical in the lab frame, making an angle χ ≈
48 degrees relative to Z, accounted for by rotating the entire (x,y,z) system by χ about Y. The lab frame (x,y,z)
rotates about Z by an angle Ωt, where Ω is the frequency of the earth’s (sidereal) rotation.

These two coordinate systems are related through the transformation

Then, vectors transform as ~blab = T ~bf ixed, while tensors transform as dlab = T df ixedT−1.

As shown in equation (5), our signal depends on the following combination of terms (for both electron and proton):

Transforming these to the ﬁxed frame, we see

˜b3 = b3 − md30 − H12.

so our observable is given by

b3 = bZ cos χ + bX sin χ cos Ωt + bY sin χ sin Ωt,
d30 = dZ0 cos χ + dX0 sin χ cos Ωt + dY 0 sin χ sin Ωt,
H12 = HXY cos χ + HY Z sin χ cos Ωt + HZX sin χ sin Ωt,

˜b3 = (bZ − mdZ0 − HXY ) cos χ

+ (bY − mdY 0 − HZX ) sin χ sin Ωt
+ (bX − mdX0 − HY Z) sin χ cos Ωt.

The ﬁrst term on the right is a constant oﬀset, not bounded by our experiment. The second and third terms each
vary at the sidereal frequency. Combining Eqn. 31 (for both e− and p) with Eqn. 5, we see

B. Comparison to previous experiments

We compare our result with other recent tests of Lorentz and CPT symmetry in Table III. Although our bounds
are numerically similar to the those from the 199Hg/133Cs experiment, the simplicity of the hydrogen atom allows us
to place bounds directly on the electron and proton; uncertainties in nuclear structure models do not complicate the
interpretation of our result. The recent limit set by the torsion pendulum experiment of Adelberger et. al. [20] on
electron Lorentz and CPT violation casts our result as a clean bound on Lorentz and CPT violation of the proton.

To make a more sensitive measure of the sidereal variation of the Zeeman frequency in a hydrogen maser, it will
be important to clearly identify and reduce the magnitude of the long term drifts of the Zeeman frequency. Possible

sources of these drifts are magnetic ﬁelds near the maser bulb caused by stray currents in heaters or power supplies
in the inner regions of the maser. Also, the scatter of the Zeeman data points, believed to be due mainly to residual
thermal ﬂuctuations, should be reduced. Both of these objectives could be accomplished by carefully rebuilding a
hydrogen maser, with better engineered power and temperature control systems.

[28] The maser used for our Lorentz symmetry test, maser P-28 was only temporarily available for our use, as it was in our
lab only to undergo several repairs. As a result, the amount of data we could acquire was limited. Maser P-8 is housed
permanently in our laboratory, so much of our characterization was done with this maser. However, this maser was not
suitable for a Lorentz symmetry test because it suﬀered from large, long term Zeeman frequency drifts, attributed to less
magnetic shielding and larger extraneous ﬁelds (e.g., from heating elements).

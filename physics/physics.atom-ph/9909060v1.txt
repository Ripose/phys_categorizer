Abstract

We analyze coherent two-color photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein conden-

sate, focusing on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in free-

bound-bound transitions from atoms to molecules. This problem is of par-

ticular interest since STIRAP is predicted to be necessarily absent in the

nondegenerate case [Javanainen and Mackie, Phys. Rev. A 58, R789 (1998)].

However, Bose-stimulation enhances the free-bound dipole matrix element for

an atomic condensate, and photoassociative STIRAP turns out to be a viable

mechanism for converting an atomic condensate to a molecular condensate

with near-unit eﬃciency.

As the ﬁeld of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases continues to develop,

candidate systems for BEC are being discovered on a regular basis. Besides the original

alkalis [1], there is the recent observation [2] of BEC in hydrogen [3]. Meanwhile, a spin-

polarized helium condensate is not out of the question [4], and recent theoretical work has

shown that coherent photoassociation might be used to produce a degenerate molecular

gas (MBEC) from an already-Bose-condensed sample of atoms [5,6]. Here we consider the

formation of MBEC using coherent photoassociation.

Photoassociation (PA) is the process in which a pair of atoms interacts with a photon,

thereby making a transition from the two-atom continuum to a bound state of the molecule.

Quantization of the molecular dissociation continuum allows one to describe such free-bound

transitions using the standard techniques of few-level quantum optics [7,8]. Beyond providing

a few-level framework, such a quasicontinuum approach has also led to a matter-quantized

formulation of photoassociation analogous to the analysis of second-harmonic generation

of light [9,6].

In this context of nonlinear matter optics [10], atom-molecule conversion

displays coherent BEC-MBEC oscillations, adiabatic following, and non-classical collapse

and revivals [6,11].

Nonetheless, one-color free-bound photoassociation generally occurs to an excited elec-

tronic state of the molecule, and the subsequent irreversible losses, whether due to pho-

todissociation (PD) or spontaneous decay, tend to negate the beneﬁts of the coherence.

In this Letter we develop coherent two-color free-bound-bound photoassociation, where the

primary photoassociated molecules are transferred with another laser ﬁeld to a stable molec-

ular state. The goal is to state-selectively convert a BEC into an MBEC, while averting

irreversible losses from electronically excited molecules. We consider pulsed free-bound and

bound-bound couplings that occur in the counter-intuitive order [12], and so correspond

to stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from atoms to molecules. Beyond its

distinctly nonlinear character, this problem is of particular interest since we have previously

argued for the absence of free-bound-bound STIRAP [7]. However, the present work illus-

trates that such transitions are possible in the case of a condensate, since the free-bound

2

dipole matrix element is Bose-enhanced due to the fact that many atoms are in the same

quantum state. A similar statistical eﬀect may also increase hot pion production in nuclear

physics [13], and speed up the decay rate of the inﬂation ﬁeld in cosmology [14].

The development herein is outlined as follows. First, we review the many-body en-

hancement for the PA dipole matrix element of a condensate, and discuss the implications

for coherent free-bound-bound STIRAP. Next we take a semi-classical approach to identify

the nonlinear counterpart of the dark state [15] that contains no primary photoassociated

molecules. Given that Bose-enhancement allows a counter-intuitive pulse scheme, the limit

t

→ −∞

ﬁnds the dark state with all atoms, while in the limit t

+

the dark state

→

∞

contains only molecules.

It then appears possible that free-bound-bound STIRAP of an

atomic condensate will produce a similarly degenerate gas of molecules. The remaining

work establishes conditions that allow such adiabatic following to occur.

Turning to the situation of Fig. 1, we assume that N identical atoms of mass m have

condensed into the same one-particle state, say, a plane wave state with wave vector k = 0.

Photoassociation removes two atoms from this state

and creates an excited molecule in

energy per stable molecule arises from the combined recoil momenta of two photons, and

equals ¯h2(q1

q2)2/4m. In second-quantized notation, we denote the Boson annihilation

operators for atoms, primarily photoassociated molecules, and stable molecules, respectively,

−

by a, b, and g.

The laser-matter interactions that drive the atom-molecule and molecule-molecule tran-

sitions are written in terms of their respective Rabi frequencies, κ = d1E1/2¯h and Ω =

d2E2/2¯h . Here the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld driving a given transition is Ei , and di

is the corresponding dipole matrix element (i = 1, 2). Lastly, we deﬁne the two-photon

and intermediate detunings, ∆ and δ, both with due inclusion of photon recoil energies.

Analogously to Ref. [6], the Hamiltonian for the system is

The Bose-enhancement of the free-bound dipole matrix element demonstrated as follows.

First we consider the Heisenberg equations of motion, which determine the time evolution

From Eqs. (4), the many-body Bose-enhancement of the free-bound dipole matrix element

is evident in the scaled Rabi frequency χ = √Nκ.

As it happens, the present STIRAP analysis depends crucially on the fact that the bare

free-bound coupling κ is scaled by the factor √N , while that for the bound-bound transition,

Ω, is unchanged. To see why, we recall photoassociation in terms of our quasicontinuum

model [7,8], which represents the dissociation continuum of the molecule as an inﬁnite num-

ber of discrete energy levels separated equally by ¯hǫ. The correct free-atom results are

recovered by taking the limit ǫ

of the frequency spacing as κ

is therefore the absence of STIRAP that has been predicted for nondegenerate free-bound-

bound transitions [7]. However, as shown above, in a condensate the bare Rabi frequency

ﬁnite value even in the thermodynamic limit [6]; χ

open the door to using STIRAP as a means to create a stable molecular condensate.

In order to facilitate an analytical solution, we deﬁne the “Kamiltonian” for the system

by adding a multiple of the conserved particle number to the Hamiltonian

where the real constant ¯hµ is identiﬁed as the chemical potential per atom. The Heisenberg

equations of motion for the unit-scaled operators become

From this point onward we also resort to the semi-classical approach analogous to the Gross-

Pitaevskii approximation used to describe an alkali condensate. Accordingly, the quantities

a, b and g are now c-numbers, rather than operators.

We are looking for adiabatic solutions to the time-evolution equations (6) for transient

couplings χ(t) and Ω(t). Denoting the characteristic Rabi frequency scale for the light pulses

by R and the characteristic pulse width by T , the adiabatic approximation ( ˙x

0, x = a, b, g)

should be valid when the evolution time scale of the system is short compared to the time

scale of the pulses; for instance when RT

is valid.

Besides the steady state, we now specify exact two-photon resonance (∆ = 0). To

economize the ensuing expressions, we also choose the Bose-enhanced Rabi coupling χ as

the scale for our frequencies by writing Ω = ¯Ωχ, δ = ¯δχ. Now, we have already assumed the

Rabi frequencies to be real. Without sacriﬁcing generality, this will allow us to consider the

amplitudes a, b, and g as strictly real. Additionally, for counter-intuitive pulses the limits

It is easy to see that the above results are the nonlinear counterparts of those obtained

from the standard STIRAP analysis [12]. The solution (7) is the dark state. For a counter-

We have checked these results with an exact numerical solution to the equations of mo-

tion (6), examining the intuitive adiabatic condition RT

state. On the other hand, a pulse area much greater than unity readily decouples the nona-

diabatic states (8), allowing the system to adiabatically follow the dark state as it moves

from the initial BEC to MBEC. In particular, Fig. 2(b) gives the probability of creating

excited molecules as

or spontaneous decay should be negligible. Coherent free-bound-bound STIRAP is thereby

conﬁrmed.

To improve upon our discussion of the adiabatic approximation, we focus speciﬁcally

on the eﬀect of pulse overlap. We apply the textbook criterion [16] for adiabaticity to the

eigenvector ψ = (a, b, g)T . From Eqs. (7) and (8), the coupling between the nonadiabatic

states, ψ±, and the rate of change of the adiabatic state,

˙ψ0, must therefore be much less than

the spacing between the respective chemical potentials,

we restrict our analysis to zero intermediate detuning (¯δ = 0), and introduce the arbitrary

is violated. Additionally, an increase in pulse area RT may provide adiabaticity despite

a poor pulse overlap. Using Gaussian pulse shapes, these observations may be quantiﬁed

as follows. In the vicinity of pulse overlap, at dimensionless times τ

this point deﬁnes the adiabatic condition in terms of D. The results for RT = (102, 103, 104)

are shown in Fig. 3. We ﬁnd that the adiabatic approximation is valid for pulse overlaps

satisfying Fmax(D) <

∼ 0.25 RT .

Incidentally, we ﬁnd exactly the same result for peaked-

exponential pulse shapes, f1,2(τ ) = exp(

/T ).

It remains to discuss a few items that we have so far ignored. The ﬁrst regards the

explicit role of photodissociation (PD). Consistent with the quasicontinuum model [7,8,11],

we consider PD as irreversible decay from the intermediate state to the atomic continuum.

Hence, if there is no intermediate-state population, there is no photodissociation. Second,

our results are of course valid regardless of trapping of the atoms and molecules, provided

that the time scale for coherent free-bound-bound STIRAP is shorter than the time scale

for the motion of the atoms and/or molecules in the trap. Third, if laser intensities permit

STIRAP during a time much shorter than the time scales for collisions between atoms and

molecules, collisions are negligible as well. Fourth, we have not mentioned the divergence of

the adiabatic factor in the wings of the pulses [12]. This is an artifact due to the mathemat-

ical shape of the pulse, and can be avoided if, in the region of interest, the shapes satisfy

d(log ¯Ω)/dτ = 0. In fact, this is the case for the peaked exponentials mentioned above.

In conclusion, we hold the line on the absence of STIRAP in non-degenerate free-bound-

bound transitions, while at the same time proposing the counter-intuitive pulse scheme as a

possible mechanism for creating a molecular condensate from an initial BEC. This dichotomy

arises because, for the case of a condensate, all N atoms are in the same quantum state, and

the subsequent Bose-enhancement of the free-bound dipole matrix element enables a counter-

8

intuitive reversal of the Rabi frequencies associated with the light pulses. Our numerical

trials have conﬁrmed that STIRAP should take place in two-color photoassociation, and

validated a simple quantitative criterion for adiabatic atom-molecule conversion.

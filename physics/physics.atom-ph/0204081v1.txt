Manifestation of the Nuclear Anapole Moment in M1 Transitions in Thallium

M. G. Kozlov
Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, Gatchina, 188300, Russia∗
(Dated: 27 April 2002)

We calculate nuclear spin-dependent parity non-conserving E1-amplitudes for optical transition
6p1/2,F → 6p3/2,F ′ and for hyperﬁne transition 6p1/2,F → 6p1/2,F ′ in 205Tl. Experimental limit
on the former amplitude placed by Vetter et al. [PRL,74,2658 (1995)] corresponds to the anapole
moment constant κa = −0.26 ± 0.27.

PACS numbers: 32.80Ys, 11.30.Er, 31.30.Jv

In 1980 Flambaum and Khriplovich [1] pointed out
that the nuclear spin-dependent (NSD) part of the par-
ity non-conserving (PNC) interaction in heavy atoms is
dominated by the contribution of the anapole moment
(AM) of the nucleus [2]. After that AM was observed in
the PNC experiment with 133Cs [3], where the measured
value of the AM constant κa appeared to be even larger
than theoretical prediction for the “best values” of the
constants of the nuclear PNC interaction (see [4] and ref-
erences therein). On the other hand, in the most accurate
6p3/2,F ′
measurement of the PNC amplitudes 6p1/2,F →
in 205Tl [5], the NSD amplitude was found to be consis-
tent with zero and smaller than theoretical predictions
[4, 6].

In Ref. [6] the ratio between NSD amplitude and the
dominant nuclear spin-independent (NSI) PNC ampli-
tude was calculated in the one-particle approximation.
Here we recalculate this ratio using CI+MBPT method
[7, 8, 9], which allows to account for both core-valence
and valence-valence correlations. We found that correla-
tion corrections are relatively large, but do not explain
the discrepancy between the measurement [5] and the
theory [4]. A more accurate measurement of NSD am-
plitude in the optical transition 6p1/2,F →
is
hampered by the much larger NSI amplitude and by the
smallness of the hyperﬁne structure of the upper state.
it may be easier to measure PNC am-
Consequently,
6p1/2,F ′,
plitude for the hyperﬁne transition 6p1/2,F →
where NSI amplitude turns to zero, while NSD amplitude
is not suppressed [10]. Here we ﬁnd correlation correc-
tions to this amplitude to be 20%.

of the PNC amplitude to the magnetic amplitude was
measured with 1% accuracy in Ref. [5] and with 3% ac-
curacy in Ref. [11]. In those experiments the hyperﬁne
structure of the lower level 6p1/2 was resolved. That al-
lowed to determine

and F = 1 of the ground state. For the level F = 0 the

induced by the interference of the NSI interaction with
the hyperﬁne interaction. For heavy nuclei this constant

In this article we calculate the NSD amplitudes
6p3/2,F ′ and use Eq. (5) and experimental re-
6p1/2,F →
sults from [5] to place a limit on the AM constant κa.
Following [5, 6] we use parametrization:

Deﬀ
is z-component of the eﬀective E1-amplitude in the
z
length-gauge [20], and m is magnetic quantum number.
Solutions of these equations can be decomposed in terms
with deﬁnite angular quantum number J:

(F, F ′) = C(Z)[QW −
R

6κξ(F, F ′)],

(6)

that links NSD amplitude to NSI one via the function
ξ(F, F ′). According to (2), one can deﬁne a function
ξ(F ) as follows:

ξ(0) = ξ(0, 1),
ξ(1) = x2ξ(1, 1) + (1

x2)ξ(1, 2).

−

(7a)
(7b)

An important property of the one-particle approxima-
tion is the equality ξ(1, 1) = ξ(1, 2) [6], which means
that ξ(1) does not depend on the coeﬃcient x2 in (2b)
and (7b). Numerical values, obtained in [6], are:

ξop(0) = 0.87;

ξop(1) =

0.29 .

In general, when electron correlations are taken into ac-
= ξ(1, 2). Then, one has to use Eq. (6) for
count, ξ(1, 1)
(F, F ′) and calculate function ξ(F ′, F ). After that, ex-
R
perimental function ξ(F ) is given by (7). Consequently,
the separation of NSI and NSD amplitudes depends on
the factor x2.

NSI amplitude was studied many times, the most ad-
vanced and accurate calculations being [17, 18] (for ear-
lier references see [19]). It was shown there that many-
body corrections to PNC amplitudes in Tl can be impor-
tant. That stimulated us to recalculate function ξ(F, F ′).
We follow here the same procedure, which was used
It is based on the combination of the many-
in [18].
body perturbation theory for core-valence correlations
and the conﬁguration interaction for three valence elec-
trons (CI+MBPT method) [7, 8, 9].

Most of the technical details of this calculation, such
as basis sets, conﬁguration sets, etc., are the same as in
Ref. [18], where a number of test calculations were made
for the spectrum, hyperﬁne constants, E1-amplitudes,
and polarizabilities. All these parameters were shown to
be in good agreement with the experiment. That allowed
to estimate the accuracy of the calculation of NSI ampli-
tude to be better than 3%. Here we use the same wave
functions for the states 6pj, but neglect several smaller
corrections, such as structural radiation, to the eﬀective
operators for valence electrons. The normalization cor-
rection is the same for NDI and NSD amplitudes and
does not aﬀect the function ξ(F, F ′).

In order to ﬁnd PNC amplitude we solve inhomoge-

neous equations:

The sum here runs over occupied (n = 1, . . . , 6) and va-
cant (n > 6) states. Contribution of the occupied states
with n
5 is very small, while n = 6 contributes almost
as much as the whole sum over vacant states. The term
n = 6 corresponds to amplitudes with the index b in (12)
and (13). It is seen, that all intermediate states in (14)
have J = 1/2. This leads to the equality ξ(1, 1) = ξ(1, 2),
which is not correct for a more general case of Eq. (13).
The many-body corrections are strongest for the weak
amplitude F = 1
F ′ = 1, which aﬀects the value of
ξ(1, 1).

Our results for the function ξ(F, F ′) are given in Ta-
ble 1. We ﬁnd them from the calculated amplitudes (12)
and (13) in two approximations. At ﬁrst, we use con-
ﬁguration interaction method for three valence electrons
with conventional operators. Then, we use second or-
der many-body perturbation theory to construct eﬀective
Hamiltonian H eﬀ and random phase approximation for
the eﬀective operators Deﬀ

enhance NSD amplitudes. For the weakest amplitude
F = 1
F ′ = 1 the correlation correction exceeds 50%.
For two other amplitudes correlations are less important,
but still account for 20% – 25% enhancement. Valence
correlations are larger for the amplitudes b. The domi-
nant contribution to these amplitudes corresponds to the
intermediate states from the conﬁguration 6s6p2, where
correlations between two p-electrons are very strong. In
contrast to that, the main contributions to amplitudes
a correspond to conﬁgurations 6s2np, where correlations
are much weaker.

We showed above, that correlation corrections to NSD
amplitudes are rather large. Moreover, our values of
ξ(1, 1) and ξ(1, 2) noticeably diﬀer from each other. That
leads to the dependence of the experimentally observed
amplitude (2b) on x2. The value of this parameter de-
pends on the experimental conditions.
In the linear

regime, x2 and 1

when in the center of the line the light was completely ab-
sorbed, and PNC signal was detected only on the wings.
In these conditions, one can expect that 1

tions, which can contribute on the percent level, so we

It was ﬁrst recognized by Novikov and Khriplovich [10],
that NSD operator also leads to the E1-amplitude be-
tween hyperﬁne sublevels of the same electronic state.
The most interesting in this respect is the hyperﬁne tran-
sition in the ground state. Such amplitudes were calcu-
lated in the one-particle approximation for Cs and Tl
[10] and for K [22]. The only many-body calculation was
done recently for Fr [21]. It is straitforward to rewrite
Eq. (13) for this case, and all calculations are similar to
those for optical transition. The result in a.u. is:

We see that electron correlations account for substan-
tial corrections to AM amplitudes, but do not explain
the diﬀerence between the experiment [5] and the nuclear
theory prediction that κa = 0.25
0.15 [4]. The exper-
6p3/2
imental accuracy for NSD amplitude for 6p1/2 →
transition is not high, because this amplitude is much

±

weaker, than NSI one. Therefore, it may be very inter-
esting to measure the hyperﬁne amplitude (23), where
PNC eﬀects are completely determined by the NSD part
of the weak interaction. Note also, that the frequencies of
the hyperﬁne transitions for two natural isotopes 203Tl
and 205Tl diﬀer by 1% and should be easily resolved.
That gives the possibility to measure AM constants for
each of the isotopes.

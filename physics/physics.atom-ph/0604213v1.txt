(Dated: February 15, 2014)

It is important to be aware of the presence of crossings and avoided crossings of eigenvalues in
the spectra of quantum mechanical systems. To this end we apply algebraic geometry to atomic
and molecular Hamiltonians arising in the context of Feshbach resonances. We solve the problem of
ﬁnding crossings in the spectra of these multiparameter Hamiltonians via a mapping to the problem
of locating roots of multivariate polynomials.
In the atomic case we point out a new class of
invariants of the Breit-Rabi equation of magnetic resonance. In the molecular case we demonstrate
how to extract information about curve crossings with practically no knowledge of the corresponding
Born-Oppenheimer potentials.

Curve crossing is a universal phenomenon with exam-
ples in many branches of both pure and applied sciences.
It arises naturally in algebraic geometry [1], facilitates
electron transfer in proteins [2], underlies stability the-
ory in mechanical engineering [3] and determines Nash
equilibria [4].
In physics possibly the ﬁrst eﬀect to be
associated with degenerate eigenvalues was conical re-
fraction, identiﬁed by Hamilton in 1833 [5]. In quantum
physics the celebrated work of von Neumann and Wigner
[6] related curve crossing to symmetry, while the analy-
sis of avoided crossings was pioneered by Landau [7] and
Zener [8]. Since then a variety of interesting phenom-
ena have been associated with quantum curve crossings.
Examples are the Jahn-Teller and molecular Aharonov-
Bohm eﬀects which are crucial in relating molecular de-
generacy to structure [9]; and Stark and Zeeman level-
crossing spectroscopies [10] which have yielded important
constants such as electric dipole moments and hyperﬁne
splittings. An avoided crossing that has come into intense
focus in contemporary atomic and molecular physics is
the Feshbach resonance [11]. Such a resonance provides
unique experimental control of the interactions in an ul-
tracold atomic gas. For example, it can be used to tune
free atom-pairs into weakly bound molecules either cold
or Bose-condensed [12], to vary the interactions in a Bose
Einstein Condensate (BEC) and make it implode or ex-
plode [13], and to explore the crossover in a degenerate
fermionic gas from the BCS or the BEC side [14].

In this Letter we describe the application of rigorous
algebraic curve crossing methods to atomic and molecu-
lar Hamiltonians represented by parametric matrices. To
demonstrate the power of these techniques, we show how
very well suited they are to the resolution of experimental
as well as theoretical considerations in locating Feshbach
resonances. Algebraic theory turns out to be relevant to
issues ranging from the preservation of the spin-purity of
a polarized atomic sample to placing the calculation of
Feshbach resonances in the Born-Oppenheimer approx-
imation on a rigorous basis. Speciﬁcally we investigate
the spectrum of a single atom, of two non-interacting

atoms, and of a diatomic molecule, each in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld. We present the case for 23Na85Rb,
which is of current interest as a candidate for Feshbach
resonances [15], but our methods are readily transferable
to other atom-pairs.

Our motivation for studying crossing phenomena al-
gebraically is threefold. First, numerically calculating
the spectrum is not enough to distinguish crossings from
ﬁne anti-crossings. One has to examine the topological
changes in the eigenstates during a circuit of the crossing
point [16]. This can quickly become ineﬃcient. Second,
recomputing the spectrum is not the most direct way
to investigate the crossings as a function of the parame-
ters. Third, it is often useful to know of the presence or
absence of crossings in a regime of parameters, without
actually having to calculate the spectrum.

We ﬁrst state some results from algebraic geometry
that are well known [1]. The discriminant of a polyno-
mial is the square of the product of the pairwise diﬀer-
Importantly, it
ences of its roots, and is an invariant.
can also be calculated directly from the coeﬃcients of
the polynomial without recourse to the roots. Typically
we will deal with the discriminant D[H(P )] of the charac-
teristic polynomial of a ﬁnite dimensional real symmetric
matrix Hamiltonian H(P ), itself a polynomial in a tun-
able parameter P . The real roots of D[H(P )] correspond
to crossings and the real parts of the complex roots to
avoided crossings [17] in the spectrum of H(P ).

We begin with an 23Na atom in its 3S1/2 ground state
split by the hyperﬁne interaction into two states labeled
by the angular momentum F = I + S where I = 3/2
and S = 1/2 are the nuclear and electronic spins respec-
tively. Throughout this Letter we will refer to the atomic
eigenstates in the |F, MF i basis where MF is the compo-
nent of F along a quantization axis. In order to retain
the polynomial form of the matrix elements, however,
all representations will be made in the uncoupled basis
|S, MSi|I, MI i, where MS,I are the components of the
respective spins along the quantization axis. In the pres-
ence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B along the z-axis the

2

atomic spectrum is described by the Breit-Rabi Hamil-
tonian HBR = A I · S + B(aSz + bIz) [18] of magnetic
resonance where A is the magnetic dipole constant and
a, b may be easily related to the electronic and nuclear
gyromagnetic ratios and the Bohr magneton. HBR is
known to exhibit a (2I + 1)-fold curve crossing at b = 0,
B = (I + 1/2)A/a for S = 1 and I 6= 0 [19] whose
origin is not yet fully understood; for I = 1 the degen-
eracies are experimentally relevant to the description of
spin-relaxation in alkalis.

We consider magnetic ﬁelds typically used to access
Feshbach resonances in the laboratory, BF esh ∈[0, 1 kG].
It is useful to know if there are any (avoided) crossings
in the spectrum of HBR in this regime for a number of
reasons. Of experimental concern is the fact that tuning
to or past a crossing introduces impurities in the spin-
polarization of the atomic sample. Further, it is conve-
nient to correlate low- and high-ﬁeld states uniquely for
calculational bookkeeping. This labeling breaks down at
a crossing. Lastly, eigenstates exchange character at an

avoided crossing, which points to a change in the quan-
tum numbers in their description. Before we investigate
the discriminant we notice that b ≪ a in HBR [20]; set-
ting b = 0 we ﬁnd

Considered as a polynomial in B, D[H b=0
BR ] is even and
exhibits no sign changes in its coeﬃcients and there-
fore has no real roots for B 6= 0 [1]. Hence there are
no curve crossings in the spectrum. The complex roots
of D[H b=0
BR ] imply well documented avoided crossings at
B = 0 and A/a = 316 G for 23Na [20]. We remark
that the zero-parameter limits of the discriminant en-
code the degeneracies due to the physical symmetries of
the corresponding Hamiltonian. For example the 26-fold
degeneracy at B = 0 can be traced to the intersections
of the 5(F = 2) and 3(F = 1) hyperﬁne states amongst
themselves: 5C2 +3 C2 = 13. We now calculate the dis-
criminant for b 6= 0:

D[HBR] = 81

65536 B26(a + 3b)2[64A6 + 32A4(a − b)2B2 + 8A2(a − b)4B4 + (a − b)6B6]

[(a − 5b)(a + 3b)A2 ± 4b2A(a − b)B − 4ab2(a − 2b)B2]
[(a − 5b)(a + 3b)A2 − 4b2(aA + 2ab + 3b2)B2]}2.

(2)

The consideration of b introduces several changes in the
discriminant. First, the A24 degeneracy in Eq.(1) is re-
moved. Further, the avoided crossings (which correspond
to the roots of the sextic in Eq.(2)) are now located
at B = 0 and A/(a − b) and have moved closer since
b/a ∼ −10−3 for 23Na. Most importantly there now ap-
pear crossings in the spectrum for B 6= 0, denoted by
the roots of the squared factor in curly braces in Eq.(2).
Evidently the coupling of the nuclear spin to the mag-
netic ﬁeld is the mechanism responsible for crossings in
the Breit-Rabi spectrum. For B > 0 there are 6 crossings
clustered around 400 kG, a rather high value compared
to BF esh. Since the spectrum of HBR has no crossings
in our region of interest, each energy curve extrapolates
uniquely to a low ﬁeld state and can therefore be labeled
using |F, MF i. To the best of our knowledge invariants
of the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian such as Eq.(2) have not
been pointed out previously. They are long but complete
catalogs of the parametric symmetries of HBR. We con-
clude this section by pointing out the interesting symme-
try a = b for which there are crossings in the spectrum,
but no avoided crossings.

We proceed to examine an s-wave collision between the
previously considered 23Na atom and an 85Rb atom. The
entrance channel to the collision is labeled by the states

in which the atoms are prepared: |2, 2iN a|2, 2iRb. Only
the component of the total angular momentum (MF total
= 4) along the magnetic ﬁeld is preserved, which implies
a coupling to three other states:
|2, 2i|3, 2i, |2, 1i|3, 3i,
and |1, 1i|3, 3i. Here we have retained the ordering of
the atoms and dropped the subscripts. We ﬁrst consider
atoms which are yet too far apart to interact, hence the
Hamiltonian H N a−Rb
is just the sum of the individual
energies of each atom. This two-atom internal energy
[Fig.1(a)] deﬁnes for a given B the threshold of the col-
lision. It is of both experimental and theoretical interest
to inspect this spectrum for crossings in BF esh ∈[0, 1
kG]. This is because for a given collision entrance chan-
nel, bound states for a Feshbach resonance are only avail-
able from channels higher in energy [11]. We substitute
numbers for all the atomic constants and present the dis-
criminant as a polynomial in B only:

described by a coupled channel calculation (CCC) using
the Hamiltonian HF esh = K.E.+H N a−Rb
+V (R), where
K.E. is the nuclear kinetic energy [21]. Although the
CCC are rigorous, they are quite elaborate, and physi-
cally not as transparent. Useful estimates of scattering
properties have been made outside of a CCC descrip-
tion [22]. Single-channel alternatives have been success-
fully sought [23] and used to ﬁt observed Feshbach res-
onances to about 5% as well as to predict others [24].
We consider here the single channel Born-Oppenheimer
approximation (BOA), which is important in providing
estimates [21, 25] of Feshbach resonances. In the BOA,
the K.E. is at ﬁrst neglected and a set of adiabatic po-
tential surfaces obtained by diagonalizing the interaction
HBO = H N a−Rb
+ V (R) for a given B and for a large
enough range of R. Then the nuclear motion on these
surfaces is solved for and a Feshbach resonance reported
when a bound state crosses the collision threshold as the
calculation is repeated for increments in B. Aside from
the Feshbach problem, this description also applies to any
diatomic molecule in a magnetic ﬁeld.

It is imperative to know if there are crossings among
the electronic potentials generated by HBO, because the
BOA breaks down precisely at such points. For this rea-
son we investigate D[HBO]. But ﬁrst we make a crucial
transformation. We rewrite V (R) = X(PS − PT ) + (VS +
VT )/2, where X = (VS − VT )/2. For internuclear dis-
tances smaller than the LeRoy radius, X signiﬁes the
exchange energy, which is responsible for mixing the col-
lision channels [23]. Since D[HBO] does not change if we
add the same term to all the diagonal elements of HBO,
we calculate D[HBO − (VS + VT )/2](= D[HBO]). The
transformation is subtle; it is not an obvious one to make
after evaluating D[HBO], which contains 13430 terms in
its fully analytic form. For larger Hilbert spaces the elim-
ination of an extra variable results in signiﬁcant savings
in computation time. But X actually plays a much more
important role in the curve crossing problem. The VS,T
themselves have very sensitive dependence on the inter-
nuclear distance R. For 23Na85Rb for instance, the latest
data requires 32(47) parameters to ﬁt VS(T ) respectively
[15]. These parameters are usually varied within their
uncertainties to yield bounds on the Feshbach resonance
predictions. It requires a signiﬁcant numerical eﬀort, al-
ways limited by resolution, to examine the spectrum for
crossings for each B, VS and VT . We demonstrate below
how the introduction of X renders the problem of curve
crossings for HBO completely insensitive to the compli-
cated functional form of the Born-Oppenheimer poten-
tials, and enables us to constrain B.

We substitute numbers for all the atomic constants in
D[HBO] and obtain a bivariate polynomial of degree 12
in B, and of degree 6 in X, which provide initial bounds
on the number of crossings for a given X and B respec-
tively. Information about speciﬁc parameter values can
also readily be established, such as the absence of any

crossings this is often superior to the spectrum. The log-
arithm is bounded from below by zero since for H(P ) real
and symmetric, D[H(P )] ≥ 0. A detailed study of the
crossings indicates for example that Feshbach resonances
may be expected in the |2, 1i|3, 3i entrance channel for
B ∈[0, 502.2 G] only; elsewhere it is the most energetic
state in the manifold. The use of Eq.(3) makes the study
of parametric variation quite trivial. If we neglect only
the coupling of the 23Na(85Rb) nucleus to the magnetic
ﬁeld the crossing c2 moves to 0.9(-1.1) MG. If we neglect
both couplings, only the crossings shown in Fig.1 remain
and are shifted along with the anti-crossings (as in the
previous cases) by about ±0.05%.

We now examine the atoms as they come close during
the collision. They begin to interact via the electrostatic
potential V (R) = VSPS + VT PT where R is the internu-
clear distance, VS,(T ) are the molecular (singlet, triplet)
potentials, and PS,T are projection operators on to the
corresponding subspaces [21]. Typically the weak magne-
tostatic dipole-dipole interaction is neglected here. V (R)
mixes the collision channels and the physics is deﬁnitively

We consider D[HBO] = P

crossings for X 6= 0 at B = 0 [6]. However the turn-on of
the magnetic ﬁeld does introduce real roots for X [26].
6
n=0 pn(B)X n i.e., as a poly-
nomial in X, with coeﬃcients depending on B and de-
mand that there be no real roots of D[HBO] = 0 for
X ∈ [−∞, +∞]. This leads to constraints on the pn
and therefore on B itself, thus establishing the B-regimes
where the BOA holds. Real root counting is a well-posed
problem in algebraic geometry: the necessary constraints
on the pn can be found by demanding that the number of
sign variations in the Sturm-Habicht sequence of D[HBO]
be equal at X = ±∞ [1]. Except for the crossings at
X = 0 found using Eq.(3), we locate none in the inter-
val BF esh ∈[0,1 kG]. Hence the BOA is valid except at
those points and the calculation of Feshbach resonances
can proceed.

We think it is quite remarkable, and points to the
power of the algebraic approach, that in order to ex-
tract information about crossings in the spectrum of a
diatomic molecule in a magnetic ﬁeld we did not use any
information about the VS,T except that their diﬀerence
is a real number! The curve crossings are entirely deter-
mined by atomic constants. Of course whether and at
what R the crossings actually occur will depend on the
speciﬁc form of the VS,T . The algebraic method merely
warns us away from the complete set of magnetic ﬁelds
that could cause the BOA to break down.
If this set
is not too restrictive, or is not in the neighborhood of a
Feshbach resonance, one need not refer to the VS,T at all.
Having demonstrated the application of algebraic ge-
ometry to atomic and molecular spectra we point out
some qualiﬁcations to our work. We make three speciﬁc
observations. First, a complex root pair P± of the dis-
criminant may not indicate an avoided crossing if there
is another pair nearby except (a) if the crossing is nar-
rowly avoided (b) if the pair in the vicinity is located on
a diﬀerent Riemann sheet of the complex energy surface
[17]. However the discriminant cannot distinguish be-
tween such sheets and the spectrum has to be consulted.
Second, the BOA ceases to provide reliable estimates if
there is quantum interference between two or more Fes-
hbach resonances [21]. Third, the error in considering
the 23Na85Rb potentials as single channels exists and has
been calculated [15].

Generally, the techniques we have described can be
readily extended to other atoms and molecules, and even
outside of the context of Feshbach resonances. We have
presented results for a manifold of size n = 4 to keep the
discussion compact; in this case the discriminant forms
an elegant bookkeeping device. An additional virtue of
the method emerges for n ≥ 5 where no general ana-
lytic solutions are achievable by algebraic means, as per
the Abel-Ruﬃni theorem. The discriminant then be-
comes the only recourse for obtaining algebraic informa-
tion about eigenvalue collisions. This was our experi-
ence,for example, in dealing with the MF total = 2 mani-

4

fold in 23Na85Rb for which n = 8. In principle, discrimi-
nants can be analytically calculated for arbitrary n. How-
ever current computing limitations make calculations (for
our speciﬁc problem) seem unrealistic for n ≫ 10. It is
fortuitous, therefore that an important problem like that
of Feshbach resonances is of a size where algebraic tech-
nique is nontrivial, yet tractable.

More generally every physical system has parameters,
and many of them can be described by low-dimensional
matrices. We have shown how to extract curve crossing
information from cases with eﬀectively one and two tun-
able parameters. Application to other systems as well as
to a larger number of parameters are among the natural
extensions of our work.

In conclusion we have demonstrated an algebraic algo-
rithm for locating curve crossings in parametric atomic
and molecular spectra. Along the way we have pointed
out a new class of invariants of the Breit-Rabi equation
and placed the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for cal-
culating Feshbach resonances on a rigorous basis, using
remarkably little knowledge about molecular structure.

We consider the inverse problem of in-line holography, applied to minimally-destructive imaging
of cold atom clouds. Absorption imaging near resonance provides a simple, but destructive measure-
ment of atom column density. Imaging oﬀ resonance greatly reduces heating, and sequential images
may be taken. Under the conditions required for oﬀ-resonant imaging, the generally-intractable in-
verse problem may be linearized. A minimally-destructive, quantitative and high-resolution image
of the atom cloud column density is then retrieved from a single diﬀraction pattern.

PACS numbers: 42.30.Rx, 42.40.Ht, 32.80.Pj

The simplest optical measurement of object struc-
ture is made by illuminating the object with radiation
and recording the diﬀraction pattern produced (Fig. 1).
The inverse problem of retrieving the structure of a
semi-transparent non-crystalline object from its Fresnel
diﬀraction pattern has been studied since Gabor’s ﬁrst in-
complete solution, known as in-line holography [1]. This
Letter solves the particular inverse problem of retrieving
the structure of a cold atom cloud from a single diﬀrac-
tion pattern produced with oﬀ-resonant laser light.

Minimally-destructive imaging of cold atoms requires
weak absorption. High-resolution imaging also places
constraints on the probe beam phase shift. Under these
assumptions, we derive a linear solution to the inverse
problem which retrieves the column density of the atom
cloud from a single diﬀraction pattern. We apply this so-
lution to demonstrate minimally-destructive imaging of
a cold atom cloud without beamsplitters, phase-plates,
or imaging optics.

Gabor’s in-line holography recovers an approximation
of the original waveﬁeld by illuminating a photographic
transparency of the diﬀraction pattern. The recon-
structed waveﬁeld is contaminated by the superimposi-
tion of an out-of-focus twin image [2]. Other forms of
holography use a reference beam to record an interference
pattern, rather than a diﬀraction pattern, allowing sep-
aration of the twin image [3]. Non-holographic methods
of diﬀraction imaging have been proposed when it is in-
convenient or impossible to generate a coherent reference
beam. The ﬁrst step is common with Gabor’s method: a
diﬀraction pattern is recorded without the need for op-
tics such as lenses and beamsplitters. In the second step,
rather than optical reconstruction of the waveﬁeld, an
image is extracted by solving the inverse problem com-
putationally.

Solutions based on the transport-of-intensity equation
(TIE) require two diﬀraction patterns at closely-spaced
propagation distances [4]. A single image solution is
preferable, particularly if imaging a rapidly-evolving ob-
ject, or if exposure times are long. There is insuﬃcient
information in a single intensity image to retrieve both
the amplitude and the phase of the waveﬁeld. This infor-

mation deﬁcit may be balanced, and the inverse problem
solved, if the object is assumed to be purely absorbing [5]
or purely phase-shifting [6], but these assumptions are
seldom valid in practice.

Instead, we present a single-image solution based on
the assumption of a monomorphous object (one made of
a single material), so that both the phase-shift φ and
the absorption µ of the object are proportional to the
column density of material along the optical path ρ(x) =
−∞ N (r) dz:

and φ(x) = kδρ(x).

The variable x represents coordinates in a plane trans-
verse to the incident wave propagating along the z-axis
and k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber for illuminating radi-
ation of wavelength λ. The absorption and phase coef-
ﬁcients β and δ correspond to a refractive index of the

The object must not be strongly absorbing, but it need
not be completely transparent. The phase-shift should
obey the ﬁnite diﬀerence condition Eq. (8), which re-
stricts large variations in the phase-shift to coarse struc-
φ(x)
tures in the object. Note that weak phase-shift (

This phase condition may always be met at small z, but
phase objects of many radians thickness may require im-
practically small propagation distances, and phase shifts
of order 1 radian are preferable.

For monomorphous objects obeying Eq. (2), there is
then a linear shift-invariant relation between the normal-

which closely approximates division by the CTF except
at spatial frequencies where the CTF is near zero. Larger
values of the Tikhonov parameter α reduce the ampliﬁca-
tion of noise in the retrieval process, but at the expense
of image distortions. Smaller values yield less distorted
but noisier retrievals.

It is clear from Fig. 2 that the solution is more sta-
ble if the object advances the phase of the incident wave
(δ < 0), and the CTF zero-crossing at low spatial fre-
quencies is avoided. The column density may be re-
trieved for phase-retarding objects (δ > 0) but, as shown
in Fig. 2, the focusing action of the phase-shift cancels
the absorption at low spatial frequencies and lower qual-
ity retrievals result.

If the diﬀraction pattern is re-imaged by a lens, the
system may be defocused behind the object so that the
eﬀective propagation distance z is negative.
It follows
from Eq. (9) that the sign-condition on δ is then reversed.
For lensless imaging, negative z cannot be achieved and
the object should be phase-advancing.

Magniﬁed images can be retrieved even without lenses.
Rather than using plane-wave illumination, a point-
source of light a distance R1 before the object produces

a spherical wave incident on the object (Fig. 1(b)). The
diﬀraction at detector distance R2 is magniﬁed by the
geometric factor M = (R1 + R2)/R1, but is otherwise
identical to the plane-wave pattern of Fig. 1(a) at the
eﬀective propagation distance zeﬀ = R2/M [13].

Conventional optical materials are phase-retarding
(δ > 0) but for x-ray imaging [10], and for imaging atomic
gases with light blue-detuned from an atomic resonance,
the phase is advanced. We now show that our solution to
the diﬀraction imaging inverse problem is exactly suited
to oﬀ-resonant imaging of cold atom clouds.

To date, all measurements of ground-state BECs have
been made with near-resonant optical probes. Resonant

heating due to spontaneous emission, with the cloud
instead shifting the phase of the probe beam. Dark-
ﬁeld [14] and Zernike phase-contrast [15] techniques of
phase microscopy have been used to render these phase-
shifts visible and hence obtain sequential, minimally-
destructive images of BEC. An interferometric tech-
nique equivalent to oﬀ-axis image holography has also
been demonstrated [16]. Although minimally-destructive
imaging has been crucial to observing many dynamic pro-
cesses in BEC, destructive absorption imaging continues
to be the standard imaging mode.

As shown above,

free space propagation produces
phase contrast without optics. Gaussian ﬁts to atom
cloud images (peak column density and diameters only)
have been extracted from ﬁtting diﬀraction patterns [17].
Our solution to the inverse problem retrieves detailed
column-density images of cold atom clouds, without re-
quiring Zernike phase-plates or interferometry.

where N is the number density of atoms, ∆ is the
detuning in natural linewidths and σ0 is the resonant
cross-section (3λ2/2π for closed transitions). Compar-
ison with Eq. (2) conﬁrms that such an atomic cloud
is a monomorphous object, with absorption and phase-
shifts through the cloud given by Eq. (1). Provided
that the atom cloud satisﬁes the weak-absorption con-
dition Eq. (7) and limited-phase condition Eq. (8), the
CTF relation Eq. (9) applies. Substituting the β and δ
coeﬃcients from Eq. (11) yields the cold atom contrast

which is then used in Eq. (10) to retrieve the column den-
sity of the atom cloud. If the detuning is blue of reso-
nance, the atom cloud advances the phase of the incident
light, and the low-frequency CTF zero is avoided.

An important feature of this application to cold atom
imaging is the regularizing eﬀect of residual absorption.
1/2∆ of
At zero spatial frequency, the CTF falls to
its maximum value, but does not vanish completely as
it would for a pure phase object. Even small residual
absorption is suﬃcient to stabilize the retrieval and then
the Tikhonov modiﬁed form Eq. (10) need only be used
at higher spatial frequencies above umin = 1/√2λz. Such
partial regularization greatly reduces distortion, and re-
trievals approach the optimal linear estimate (Wiener
ﬁlter) which can only be calculated with full advance
knowledge of the object power spectrum. Retrievals are
quite insensitive to α.

This linearization of the inverse problem is only valid
if the atom cloud meets the absorption and phase con-
ditions (7,8). Minimally-destructive imaging necessarily
obeys the weak-absorption condition. The phase con-
dition Eq. (8) also broadly concurs with physical con-
straints due to refraction and resolution. Light refracted
by the object must remain within the numerical aperture
of the lens (or detector) [14]. It follows that structures at
the diﬀraction limit of the imaging system should have
phase variations less than one radian. Objects satisfying
this ‘thin object’ condition – that the detailed structure
of the object must vary by less than a radian – are likely
to also satisfy the slowly-varying phase condition Eq. (8).
Detuning the probe light by ρmaxσ0/4 full linewidths
from resonance reduces the peak phase-shift to order one
radian. BECs typically have resonant optical-densities
ρmaxσ0
300 and so detunings must be of order 100Γ
to meet the refraction condition. At such detunings,
many images may be taken before the cloud is appre-
ciably heated. In the shot-noise limit, further increasing
detuning and intensity does not improve the SNR be-
yond a limiting value, and in the presence of technical
noise will reduce the SNR. It has been shown that this
shot-noise SNR limit is determined only by the number
of spontaneous emission events and condensate parame-
ters [18].

experiment,

In a proof-of-principle

the point-
projection conﬁguration of Fig. 1(b) was used to image a
cold atom cloud. A diverging probe beam, detuned +Γ
from resonance, propagates from the cleaved endface of
a single-mode optical ﬁber, expanding for R1 = 125 mm
before passing though a 85Rb magneto-optical trap
(MOT). The beam propagated a further distance
R2 = 155 mm to a CCD chip, producing the diﬀraction
pattern shown in Fig. 3. The column-density image
retrievals take around
was retrieved using Eq. (10);
one second on a Pentium-III processor using standard
discrete Fourier transform algorithms [19].

It is usually not possible to measure the propagation
distances R1 and R2 accurately enough to produce an op-
timal retrieval. Instead, the retrieval is performed with
the contrast transfer function ˜h(u; z) evaluated at vari-
ous values of z until a sharp image is retrieved. Thus

resolution limits. For a detector of diameter D, the min-
imum resolvable line spacing in the retrieved image is of
order 2λR2/D, as it is for a lens of the same diameter
in the same position. The R1 distance should then be
chosen to provide suﬃcient magniﬁcation that resolution
is limited by diﬀraction and not by the pixel size. As an
example, a BEC in a glass cell imaged with R1 = 12 mm
and R2 = 60 mm on a D = 25 mm CCD with 9 µm pixels
yields a pixel resolution of 3 µm and a diﬀraction-limited
resolution of 3.7 µm. Further, the CTF depends on z,
λ, ∆ and u. Once z is set by ‘focusing’, the remaining
quantities are readily measured to better than 1%. Such
well-deﬁned parameters and the lack of optical aberration
yield highly quantitative column density measurements.

We solve the inverse problem of retrieving a quan-
titative column density image from a single diﬀraction
pattern by exploiting the proportionality between ab-
sorption and phase shift through a single-material ob-
ject. The predicates of the solution are uniquely suited
to imaging cold atom clouds. Optical aberrations are pre-
cluded by avoiding the need for image formation entirely.
Beam-splitters, phase-plates and other optical elements
are also unnecessary. The holographic record allows re-
focusing after the image has been acquired. The solution
can be used with existing absorption imaging systems
simply by defocusing the imaging lens. We calculate
near-wavelength resolution when using point-projection
to image Bose-Einstein condensates.

focusing is performed in software when retrieving, rather
than by adjusting lens positions when imaging. As a
corollary, the retrievals show holographic depth-of-ﬁeld:
one diﬀraction pattern can be used to retrieve images at
many diﬀerent z values. The very real problems of focus-
ing the optics, and of the limited depth-of-ﬁeld inherent
in high-resolution imaging, are completely obviated.

While the precise setting and knowledge of the propa-
gation distance is immaterial, its coarse setting aﬀects the
shape and contrast of the diﬀraction pattern and hence
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the retrieved image. In
the limit of zero propagation distance, only residual ab-
sorption contrast will be rendered. In the limit of large
propagation distance and for small phase-shifts, the root-
mean-square SNR approaches 71% of that obtained with
the Zernike technique.

A further advantage of the point-projection conﬁgura-
tion is the absence of lenses, and their resolution-limiting
aberrations. Diﬀraction contrast may also be produced
by defocusing an existing absorption imaging system,
which may be more convenient than placing the camera
very close to the object. While lens aberrations remain,
the advantages of holographic depth-of-ﬁeld and post-hoc
focusing are retained.

In practice, the propagation distance is constrained by

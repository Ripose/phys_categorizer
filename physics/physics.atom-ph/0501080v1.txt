Pyramidal Atoms: Berylliumlike Hollow States.

Based on the idea that four exited eletrons arrange themselves around the nuleus in the or-

ners of a pyramid in order to minimize their mutual repulsion, we present an analytial model of

quadruply exited states. The model shows exellent omparison with ab initio results and provides

a lear physial piture of the intrinsi motion of the four eletrons. The model is used to predit

on(cid:28)guration-mixing frations and spetra of these highly orrelated states.

Desribing eletron orrelations in terms of simple

intra-shell states.

physial pitures requires an understanding of the inter-

eletroni interation whih goes beyond numerial di-

agonalization of the Hamiltonian of the system. The

study of eletron-eletron orrelation in multiply exited

states has ontributed a lot to this understanding and

in the eighties group theoretial [1, 2℄, moleular adia-

bati [3℄, and hyperspherial [4℄ approahes led to an un-

derstanding of doubly exited states in terms of approxi-

mate quantum numbers assoiated with angular and ra-

dial orrelations. In the nineties advanes in light soures

stimulated researh on triply exited hollow states in Li

(see Ref. [5℄ for a reent review). In partiular, theoret-

ial models referred to as the three-eletron ionization

ladder [6, 7℄, the normal mode analysis [8, 9, 10℄, and

the symmetri rotor [11, 12, 13℄ on(cid:28)rmed the appealing

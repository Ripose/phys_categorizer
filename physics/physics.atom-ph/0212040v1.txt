Using optical Ramsey interferometry, we precisely measure the laser-induced AC-stark shift on the
S1/2–D5/2 “quantum bit” transition near 729 nm in a single trapped 40Ca+ ion. We cancel this shift
using an additional laser ﬁeld. This technique is of particular importance for the implementation
of quantum information processing with cold trapped ions. As a simple application we measure the
atomic phase evolution during a n × 2π rotation of the quantum bit.

Atomic two-level systems are currently discussed ex-
tensively for quantum information processing [1, 2, 3].
Typically, a qubit is encoded in an atomic transition be-
tween levels with extremely slow radiative decay: Hy-
perﬁne ground states are used as qubits which are con-
nected via a far-oﬀ-resonant Raman transition [4]. Al-
ternatively, the qubit is encoded in a superposition of a
ground state and a long-lived metastable state [5], manip-
ulated on a direct optical quadrupole transition. In both
cases the transition matrix element between the qubit
levels is small, such that relatively high laser intensities
are required to drive the transition. These strong elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds will unavoidably lead to level shifts
known as the dynamical or AC-Stark shift [6].

Even though a pure two-level system does not show
AC-Stark shift if driven by resonant laser radiation, in
real physical situations additional energy levels exist
which lead to signiﬁcant AC-Stark shifts of the qubit
energy levels. Since quantum algorithms manifest them-
selves in many-particle quantum interference, any uncon-
trolled phase shift induced by manipulation of the qubits
complicates the implementation of these algorithms con-
siderably and must be avoided. The interest in fast one-
and two-qubit manipulations aggravates the problem [7],
since strong laser ﬁelds are required. Therefore complica-
tions due to AC-Stark shifts arise in most realizations of
quantum information processing with trapped ions [8, 9].
Similar problems exist in precision spectroscopy [10] and
with optical clocks [11, 12].

In this paper we present a measurement which iden-
tiﬁes diﬀerent contributions to phase shifts of a qubit
caused by AC-Stark level shifts. We determine the rel-
ative oscillator strengths of various contributing transi-
tions. Finally, we show how to compensate for the AC-
Stark shift experimentally. This compensation greatly
simpliﬁes the implementation of quantum algorithms. As
an application of the compensation method we demon-
strate the controlled sign change of a qubit wavefunction
under rotation by 2π.

In the following we focus on the qubit transition be-
tween the S1/2 ground state and the metastable D5/2

The second largest contribution arises from oﬀ-resonant

bands: For a trapped ion, the Rabi frequencies on the red
and blue motional sideband are given by ΩSB = Ωη√n
and Ωη√n + 1, respectively, where η denotes the Lamb-

ments of quadrupole transitions is given in Refs. [14, 15].
The coeﬃcients a−1/2, a−5/2 and a3/2 are the squares
of the relative coupling strengths. We deﬁne a−1/2 to
be one, since the Ramsey spectroscopy is carried out on
this transition. From the laser polarization and laser axis
with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld axis we calculate [15]
a−5/2 = 0.278 and a3/2 = 0.0556. The factor of 2 in

transition such that the shift of both the upper and lower
state is detected. From the other Zeeman components,
however, only the shift of the lower state
becomes ap-
parent. The constant b in Eq. (1) contains the squared
relative coupling strengths to all other dipole transitions.
No dependence on the laser detuning appears since the
transitions are far oﬀ-resonant.

The optimum ﬁt of Eq. (1) to the data in Fig. 3 is
obtained with a−5/2 = 0.32 (2), a+3/2 = 0.05 (2), b =
0.112 (5)/2π (MHz)−1 and ΩAC/2π = 357 (3) kHz. We
independently measured a−5/2 = 0.36 (2) and a+3/2 =
0.05 (1) with resonant Rabi oscillations. These values
agree within their error margins with those obtained from
the ﬁt to the Stark shift data.

Most of the current proposals for quantum computa-
tion require that the ion is driven on the motinal side-
bands. Applying a laser on the blue axial sideband of
transition (“gate laser”) at a detuning of
the
∆/2π= +1.7 MHz results in a negative AC-Stark shift.

However, shining in a second light ﬁeld at a frequency
whose AC-Stark shift is positive can compensate for this
unwanted phase shift. As discussed in the introduction,
such an AC-Stark shift cancellation is a prerequisite for
any quantum algorithm. Our method to determine the
optimum setting of the compensation laser consists of
the following steps: First we detune the gate laser by
80 kHz from the sideband resonance to avoid exci-
≃
tation into the D state (its AC-Stark eﬀect however is
still practically identical to that of a laser ﬁeld resonant
with the sideband). Then we minimize the total AC-
Stark eﬀect by adjusting the intensity and detuning of
the compensation laser ﬁeld such that the oscillations in
PD disappear. Both light ﬁelds are generated from the
output of a single Ti:Sapphire laser by driving a broad-
band AOM (in double pass conﬁguration) with the two
rf-frequencies simultaneously. Since both light ﬁelds are
derived from the same laser, intensity ﬂuctuations do not
aﬀect the compensation.

≤

The accuracy to which the AC-Stark eﬀect can be
nulled is proportional to (2 TR)−1 S/N , where TR de-
notes the Ramsey interrogation time (here 200 µs) and
S/N the signal to noise ratio of the state measurement.
Integrating this measurement for long times, to improve
S/N , is limited by the frequency drift of the laser source
near 729 nm (typically
1 Hz/s), since a drift of the
relative phase of the Ramsey pulses mimics a residual
AC-Stark eﬀect. To overcome this problem, we optimize
the Rabi frequency and detuning of the compensation
laser by alternating Ramsey experimental sequences with
τ = 0 and τ
200µs. Thus, a slow drift is discriminated
against a residual phase shift due to imperfect compensa-
tion. Limited by the shot noise of PD(τ ), any AC-Stark
eﬀect can be cancelled to within
2π30 Hz in 60 s.
See Fig. 2b for the compensation data over the course of
time, each data point corresponding to 100 repetitions of
the experimental sequence and a time duration of 2 s.

As an application of the compensation method we
demonstrate the sign change of a wavefunction, a sim-
ple building block frequently required in quantum algo-
rithms. A driven spin-1/2-system transforms into its ini-
tial state only by a 4π rotation, whereas a 2π rotation
leads to a sign change of the wavefunction. This phase
shift is the central part of the Cirac–Zoller proposal [8] for
quantum gates with trapped ions [16]. Similarly, Ramsey
experiments on Rydberg atoms have been performed in
the microwave regime, to investigate the AC-Stark shift
of the electromagnetic vacuum ﬁeld [17] and to perform
a tunable phase gate [18].

In our experiment, the ion is ﬁrst prepared in the vi-
brational and electronic ground state and then driven

In conclusion we have precisely measured optical AC-
Stark shifts on a single ion using an optical Ramsey in-
terferometer. The method highlights the phase evolution
an atom undergoes while it is irradiated oﬀ-resonantly
with light. Measuring on a single ion removes the in-
ﬂuence of the beam intensity proﬁle on the measure-

4

ment result, typically occuring with atom samples. We
have also demonstrated how to compensate for the AC-
Stark shift with a simultaneous laser pulse at another
frequency. The compensation enables quantum comput-
ing on optical transitions and to detect phases of multi-
particle quantum interference in a straightforward way.
The quality to which the AC-Stark eﬀect can be cancelled
is proportional to the chosen Ramsey interrogation time.
Therefore, it is likely that the quality of this novel phase
compensation method will improve when in future longer
coherence times can be realized, as necessary for a large
number of quantum gate operations.

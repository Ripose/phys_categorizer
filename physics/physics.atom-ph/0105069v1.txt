Ultracold atoms at temperatures close to the recoil limit have been achieved by extending Doppler
cooling to forbidden transitions. A cloud of 40Ca atoms has been cooled and trapped to a temper-
ature as low as 6 µK by operating a magneto-optical trap on the spin-forbidden intercombination
transition. Quenching the long-lived excited state with an additional laser enhanced the scattering
rate by a factor of 15, while a high selectivity in velocity was preserved. With this method more
than 10 % of pre-cooled atoms from a standard magneto-optical trap have been transferred to the
ultracold trap. Monte-Carlo simulations of the cooling process are in good agreement with the
experiments.

The preparation of ultracold atoms with tempera-
tures far below the millikelvin regime is essential for
the progress in many ﬁelds such as metrology, atom op-
tics and the study of collective eﬀects like Bose-Einstein-
Condensation (BEC). Up to now the available techniques
are restricted to a limited number of species, mainly
those that can be cooled below the Doppler limit [1] e. g.
by eﬃcient polarization gradient cooling [2], by veloc-
ity selective coherent population trapping (VSCPT) [3]
or by Raman cooling [4].
In general, these techniques
are only applicable to atoms with magnetic or hyperﬁne
sub-structure in the ground state. Atoms with a sin-
gle ground state, like the alkaline earths, often exhibit
forbidden transitions with unique properties e. g. for op-
tical frequency standards [5–7], atom interferometry [8],
the study of cold collisions [9,10] and possibly for achiev-
ing BEC by all optical means [11,12]. Doppler cooling on
such forbidden transitions can lead to temperatures much
lower than the recoil limit [13].
In strontium Doppler
cooling has recently led to phase space densities close to
quantum degeneracy [14]. Up to now, this method failed
to work for neutral atoms with ultra-narrow (forbidden)
lines since in this case the light forces might be compa-
rable or even smaller than the gravitational force which
makes magneto-optical trapping of atoms diﬃcult or im-
possible.

In this letter we present a novel method for eﬀective
Doppler cooling and trapping of pre-cooled atoms on ex-
tremely narrow transitions in three dimensions. The low
scattering rate associated with the narrow line width is
artiﬁcially enhanced by a repumping or ’quenching’ laser
which de-excites the atoms via an intermediate level. In
this case the atoms can be considered as eﬀective two-
level systems with tunable linewidths that can be tai-
lored during the cooling process for optimum eﬃciency
of the procedure. Similar schemes were performed to

more rapidly cool trapped ions [15] and for the eﬃcient
deﬂection of a beam of metastable helium [16]. Whereas
in the case of metastable helium cycling on the second
transition was simply used to increase the radiation pres-
sure, our scheme preserves the velocity selectivity of the
narrow transition. Our calculations for magnesium and
calcium showed that this ’quench cooling’ can eﬃciently
trap atoms released from a broad-line magneto-optical
trap (MOT) and cool them to temperatures close to the
recoil limit. We utilize this scheme for the ﬁrst time to
capture and cool free atoms in three dimensions.

The temperature that can be achieved in Doppler cool-
ing on broad lines is determined by a balance between
damping forces and the heating due to spontaneous re-
coil momenta. Here, broad lines are characterized by the
linewidth of the transition Γ being large compared to the
change in the Doppler shift due to one photon recoil, i.e.
¯hk2
≪ Γ where m denotes the atomic mass and k the
m
wavevector of the exciting light. On a two-level system
this ﬁnally leads to a Doppler temperature TD = ¯hΓ
2kB
with the Boltzmann’s constant kB.

For monochromatic excitation on narrow lines, the
Doppler cooling limit was calculated to be approximately
half the recoil temperature given by kBTrec = ¯h2k2
m [17].
A multichromatic excitation was proposed [13] which
would allow to reach a temperature even below that tem-
perature. However, narrow-line cooling is hampered by
the small force Fmax = ¯hkΓ
2 . For cooling of calcium on the
intercombination line 1S0 - 3P1 (see ﬁg. 1, Γ1 = 2000 s−1)
Fmax is only 1.5 times the gravitational force. To increase
the force, we have reduced the lifetime of the upper level
through excitation to the 4s4d 1D2 state (λ = 453 nm),
from where the atoms decay rapidly via the 4s4p 1P1
state to the ground state. In a diﬀerent picture, the 3P1
level acquires an admixture of the 1D2 level (natural de-
cay rate Γ2 = 1.4 × 107 s−1) through the coupling by the

1

quench laser. Hence, for low saturation the width of the
triplet state increases proportional to the quench laser
intensity. Another possibility for quenching was demon-
strated by the NIST group where coupling to the 4s5s
1S0 state by a 553 nm laser was used to achieve cooling
of Ca in one dimension [18].

FIG. 1. Excerpt from the Ca level scheme with wavelengths
and transition rates of the relevant transitions. The 1S0 -
1P1 transition is used for pre-cooling atoms in a standard
broad-line MOT. The intercombination transition 1S0-3P1,
quenched by the transition 3P1-1D2 forms the second stage
MOT.

In a preliminary experiment in 1-D with sequential ex-
citation to the 3P1 state and subsequent quenching we
have found a quenching rate of r12 ≈ 1.4 × 104 s−1. This
is more than one order less than is calculated from the
atomic data [19] of the quenching transition. We assume
the diﬀerence to be in part due to the uncertainty in the
theoretical A-coeﬃcient. From our preliminary measure-
ment we estimate a quenching rate r12 ≈ 3 × 104 s−1 for
our 3–D MOT conﬁguration, corresponding to an average
broadening factor of 15 limited by the laser power avail-
able. In the MOT conﬁguration, excitation to the 3P1
level and quenching is performed simultaneously. Solving
the optical Bloch equations we arrive at an eﬀective two
level system with an eﬀective linewidth of the metastable
3P1 level of Γeﬀ = Γ1 + r12. Since the increased linewidth
of Γeﬀ ≈ 2π × 5 kHz is still small compared to the re-
coil shift, atoms can be lost when kicked out of reso-
nance by the photon recoils of one quenching cycle. To
overcome this we broaden the excitation spectrum by a
harmonic frequency modulation (peak-to-peak amplitude
δfpp = 1.4 MHz, modulation frequency fmod = 15 kHz)
of the 657-nm laser (linewidth approximately 500 Hz) us-
ing an acousto-optic modulator. The high-frequency end
of this frequency comb is detuned below resonance by
∆ ≈ 2π × 280 kHz.

With the laser power available on the intercombi-
nation transition we saturate the transition even with
the quenching laser on. With a population in the 3P1
state close to 0.4 the total scattering rate amounts to
S ≈ 1.2 × 104 s−1.

In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, two cooling regimes
can be distinguished:
In the Doppler regime which is
eﬀective at larger velocities, the Doppler shift brings
the atom into resonance with a counterpropagating laser
beam. This leads to a constant damping force to-
wards zero velocity and a typical cooling time of tD ≈
mv0/¯hk1S = 5.6 ms using an initial velocity v0 = 1 m/s
and k1 being the wave vector of the 657 nm laser. Be-
cause this time has to be small enough to prevent atoms
from escaping the laser beams before being stopped, we
have increased the force by using the same circular polar-
ization for the cooling 657 nm beams and the quenching
453 nm laser. Absorption of the quenching photon from
the same direction as the initial photon is favored by 6
to 1 as a result of the ratio of the Clebsch-Gordan coef-
ﬁcients involved.

The second regime occurs at lower temperatures when
slow atoms are not excited by any laser and accumulate
near zero-velocity. Compared to VSCPT there is still a
small oﬀ-resonant excitation probability. Therefore this
regime can be referred to as ’velocity-selective gray-state
trapping’. The limit of this cooling method depends on
the detuning ∆ and can be as low as a fraction of the re-
coil velocity. The relevant timescale is much longer than
in the Doppler regime mentioned above as the cooling
relies on random jumps to the gray state.

The situation changes with the magnetic quadrupole
ﬁeld present in the MOT conﬁguration. Here, atoms that
are in the gray state at the MOT center will eventually
move to a point where they come into resonance with one
laser by the Zeeman shift. There they will be pumped out
of the gray state and accelerated towards the trap center
until the atoms are just Doppler shifted oﬀ resonance.
Therefore the average atomic velocity will be of the order
of a few recoils [20] independent of the detuning ∆. The
detuning however determines the size of the cold atomic
cloud.

The recoil that determines the achievable velocity
width is due to the ﬂuorescence photons at 733 nm and
423 nm from the decay of the 1D2 level (ﬁg. 1) and the
quench photon at 453 nm that are involved in the ﬁnal
cycle before the atom gets oﬀ resonance. The eﬀective
recoil velocity is given by the quadratic sum of the three
photon momenta and amounts to vrec ≈ 3.5 cm/s, if we
neglect polarization eﬀects, i.e. assuming also a random
direction of the absorbed quench photon.

We realized this novel cooling scheme in an experi-
ment, where we started with a broad-line MOT on the
cooling transition 1S0 - 1P1 made of three retroreﬂected
laser beams with λ = 423 nm. With a total power
of 30 mW approximately 107 atoms were cooled and
trapped directly from a thermal beam. The narrow-line
MOT at 657 nm was realized by three circular polarized
beams (power approx. 7 mW per beam with a diam-
eter of 5 mm), that were parallel to the 423 nm MOT
beams. Dichroitic retroreﬂectors were used to combine

2

the beams. The quench laser beams at 453 nm were cou-
pled into the vacuum chamber under an angle of 22.5◦
to the other cooling beams in the horizontal plane and
nearly parallel in the vertical direction. To make eﬃcient
use of the available power (P ≈ 20 mW) a single beam
of diameter ≈ 3 mm was fed through the setup three
times and ﬁnally retroreﬂected, similar to a MOT conﬁg-
uration. Due to the limitations of our vacuum chamber
which was designed for an optical Ca frequency standard
it was not possible to completely match the sizes and di-
rections of the quench and MOT laser beams. We expect
this to limit the possible transfer eﬃciency in our setup.
After pre-cooling the atoms in the broad-line MOT to
vrms ≈ 0.7 m/s, the 423 nm laser was switched oﬀ and the
magnetic ﬁeld gradient was lowered within 100 µs from
60 × 10−4 T/cm to 0.3 × 10−4 T/cm and the 657 nm
cooling laser and the quench laser were switched on. The
small gradient accounts for the much smaller acceleration
that can be reached by cooling on the narrow line, even
with quenching. After the cooling time the 657 nm laser
was switched oﬀ while the quench laser remained on to
repump most of the atoms to the ground state. To reduce
the background from ﬂuorescence of decaying atoms that
have not been repumped, we waited for 0.5 ms to 1 ms
before measuring the velocity distribution.

FIG. 2. Velocity distribution measured by the excitation
spectrum of the Doppler broadened intercombination tran-
sition. The distribution after cooling in a usual broad-line
MOT (a) shows an rms velocity of 71 cm/s (T = 2.4 mK
) which is reduced to 4.3 cm/s (T = 9 µK) after 25 ms of
second stage cooling (b). Comparing the areas of the two
distributions gives a transfer eﬃciency of 12 %.

The velocity distribution of the atomic ensemble was
obtained by measuring the Doppler broadening of the in-
tercombination transition. Using long excitation pulses
the corresponding interaction-time broadening could be
neglected. To avoid Zeeman broadening of the transi-
tion the magnetic ﬁeld was changed from a quadrupole
to a homogeneous ﬁeld. Fig. 2 shows a typical velocity
distribution detected from the ﬂuorescent decay of the
3P1 state before and after the cooling on the quenched

intercombination line. To determine the eﬃciency of the
cooling process we compare the areas of the two curves
giving a transfer eﬃciency of ηN = 12 % in the case of
ﬁg. 2. Due to the integration over all transverse veloc-
ities the increase in count rate by a factor of 2 shown
in ﬁg. 2, does not reﬂect the increase in the number of
atoms ηv with v ≈ 0. This increase is calculated from
ηv = ηN (vrms, 423/vrms, 657)3 as ηv ≈ 500.

The temperature as a function of the cooling time (ﬁg.
3) shows an exponential decay with a time constant of
1.4 ms until the rms velocity is reduced to a few times
the eﬀective recoil velocity vrec. For longer cooling times
a further slow reduction of the velocity width is observed.
A temperature of (5.6 ± 0.4) µK after 100 ms of cooling
has been observed, which corresponds to an rms velocity
of 3.4 cm/s that is close to the calculated eﬀective vrec.

ity vrec = 3.5 cm/s after second stage cooling versus the cool-
ing time. The crosses connected by lines show the results of
Monte-Carlo simulations using the experimental parameters.
The simulated atom number is scaled to ﬁt the measurement.

The time dependence of the total number of atoms as
deduced from the area of the measured Doppler curves
(ﬁg. 3) shows ﬁrst a fast loss due to atoms that could not
be captured by the narrow-line MOT and then an almost
linear decrease in atom number with cooling time. From
absorption images of the ultracold atomic cloud after a
cooling time of 15 to 20 ms we obtain rms radii of 0.8
mm and 0.4 mm in the horizontal and vertical directions,
respectively.

In our present setup signiﬁcant variations of the ﬁnal
temperature and the transfer eﬃciency occur over the
day as can be seen from the diﬀerent scales of ﬁg. 3
and ﬁg. 4. We attribute this to slight changes in the
alignment and the detuning of the quench laser.

We have modelled the cooling and trapping by a semi-
classical 3-D Monte-Carlo simulation. The temporal de-
pendence of the temperature is in good agreement with
the experimental results also showing a fast reduction
and a further slow decrease of the rms velocity approach-

3

ing the recoil velocity for long times. The calculated
transfer eﬃciency typically amounts to 60 %, far above
the experimentally observed 12 %, probably due limita-
tions of our setup as mentioned above. The slow loss
of atoms also shows up in the Monte-Carlo simulations,
where it was identiﬁed as caused by atoms moving out of
the intersection region of the laser beams. Similar tem-
peratures near the recoil limit have been obtained with
simulations for the narrow-line cooling of magnesium on
the intercombination transition 3s2 1S0 - 3s3p 3P1 and
quenching using the 3s3p 3P1 - 3s4s 1S0 transition.

particularly useful in the case of Ca where calculations
[12] indicate a positive scattering length.

In conclusion, we have presented a cooling method ap-
plicable to atoms with narrow or forbidden transitions.
We have demonstrated this method by cooling a 40Ca
atomic ensemble in three dimensions to a residual rms-
velocity close to one eﬀective recoil. Our scheme is ap-
plicable to arbitrarily narrow atomic transitions that can
be artiﬁcially broadened and, hence, does not suﬀer from
the associated small forces.

FIG. 4. Root-mean-square velocity and transfer eﬃciency
after 25 ms of second stage cooling versus the detuning of the
657 nm MOT laser. The bars indicate the statistical uncer-
tainty of vrms from the ﬁts to the measured velocity distribu-
tions.

The detuning dependence of the ﬁnal temperature is
shown in ﬁg. 4. The velocity reaches a minimum around
270 kHz and is nearly constant for larger detunings, as
discussed above. The increase at lower detunings is prob-
ably due to excitation in the wings of the excitation pro-
ﬁle. The transfer eﬃciency shows a maximum at approx-
imately the same detuning, as for smaller detunings the
capturing probability is reduced. For larger detunings
the loss increases because the trap becomes larger than
the intersection region of the laser beams.

This quench cooling scheme has the distinct advantage
that the scattering rate can be tailored for diﬀerent pur-
poses by adjusting the power of the quench laser, e.g.
using a high scattering rate for eﬃcient capturing and
then lowering the rate to reach the lowest temperatures.
For use in an atomic frequency standard ultracold atoms
at moderate density are desired. This can be reached by
completely switching oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld and ﬁnally
cooling the atoms in an optical molasses to reach even
sub-recoil temperatures. On the other hand, to enable ef-
ﬁcient ﬁlling of an optical dipole trap one would increase
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient after a few milliseconds to
reach a high phase-space density.

The presented results open the way to a wide variety of
experiments including the formation of quantum degen-

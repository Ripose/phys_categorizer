Abstract

The quantum electrodynamic theory of the nuclear recoil eﬀect in
atoms to all orders in αZ is formulated. The nuclear recoil corrections
for atoms with one and two electrons over closed shells are considered
in detail. The problem of the composite nuclear structure in the theory
of the nuclear recoil eﬀect is discussed.

1 Introduction

The complete αZ-dependence expressions for the nuclear recoil corrections
to the energy levels of hydrogenlike atoms were ﬁrst derived in [1]. These
expressions consist of three contributions: the Coulomb contribution, the
one-transverse-photon contribution, and the two-transverse-photon contri-
bution. For a state a the Coulomb contribution is given by (the relativistic
units ¯h = c = 1 are used in the paper)

An attempt to derive the complete αZ-dependence expressions for the
nuclear recoil eﬀect was previously undertaken in [2]. Except for the Coulomb
contribution, the expressions found in [2] are in disagreement with the ones
given above. A dominant part of this disagreement is caused by technical
errors made in [2]. If we remove these errors from [2], a discrepancy remains
in the one-transverse-photon contribution and, in addition, appears in the
Coulomb contribution. This discrepancy was discussed in detail in [1].

Recently, the equations (1)-(5) were rederived in [3,4].

[3], it
was noted that the sum of these expressions can be written in the following
compact form

This simple formula contains all the nuclear recoil corrections within the
(αZ)4m2/M approximation. The remaining terms (Eqs. (2),(4), and (5))
taken to the lowest order in αZ give the Salpeter corrections [6]. Evaluation
of these terms to all orders in αZ in the range Z = 1
100 was done in
In particular, it was found in [7] that the complete (in αZ) nuclear

recoil correction, additional to the Salpeter one, to the Lamb shift (n = 2)
in hydrogen constitutes -1.32(6) kHz. This value almost coincides with the
value of the (αZ)6m2/M correction found in [4,8-10].

The complete αZ-dependence expressions for the nuclear recoil correc-
tions for high Z few-electron atoms were derived in [11]. These formulas
were used in [7] to calculate the nuclear recoil corrections to all orders in αZ
for high Z lithiumlike atoms. As it follows from these formulas, within the
(αZ)4m2/M approximation the nuclear recoil corrections can be obtained by
averaging the operator

multicharged ions.

In the present paper we generalize the theory of the nuclear recoil eﬀect to
an arbitrary case of a many-electron atom. In particular, this generalization
allows one to use as the zero approximation a potential that is diﬀerent from
In addition, it allows one to use the formalism
the pure Coulomb ﬁeld.
In Sec. 2, we
in which the closed shells are refered to the vacuum state.
formulate the basic equations of the method.
In Sec. 3 , we apply this
method to an atom with one electron over closed shells. In Sec. 4, the case
of an atom with two electrons over closed shells is considered. In Sec. 5, the
problem of the composite nuclear structure is discussed.

2 Basic formalism

Like Refs. [3,4], we will consider the nucleus as a non-relativistic particle. In
the Schr¨odinger representation and the Coulomb gauge, the Hamiltonian of
the whole system is

where m is the electron mass, M is the nucleus mass, e is the electron charge
(e < 0), Xn is the radius vector of the nucleus, Pn =

Here we have omitted the hyperﬁne interaction term. The sum of the ﬁrst
four terms in (12) is the standard Hamiltonian of the electron-positron ﬁeld
interacting with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and with the classical
Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus Vc =
( a ﬁnite nuclear charge distribu-
−
tion can be taken into account by replacing Vc with the potential of an
extended nucleus (see Sec. 5)). The last term in (12) deﬁnes the nuclear
recoil corrections of the ﬁrst order in m/M. The part of this term containing
(x))) will con-
the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum ( Pf =
tribute only in the ﬁrst and higher orders in α and, so, will not be discussed
here. It follows, to the zeroth order in α the nuclear recoil corrections can
be calculated by adding to the standard Hamiltonian the following term

As is known, for description of an atomic system within QED it is con-
venient to use the interaction representation in the Furry picture. In such a
theory the normal ordered form of HM taken in the interaction representation
must be added to the interaction Hamiltonian. A simple way to derive formal

expressions for the energy level shifts consists in using the technique devel-
E(0)
oped in [14,15]. According to this technique, the energy shift ∆Ea = Ea−

The Green function G is constructed using the Wick theorem after the transi-
tion in (16) to the interaction representation. The diagram technique rules for
G are considered in detail in [15]. Including HM in the interaction Hamilto-
nian gives the following additional lines and vertices to the diagram technique
rules for G.

An important advantage of the approach considered here, in comparison
with one developed in [1,11], consists in that the present method is suitable
for arbitrary local potential V (r) (e.g., a local version of the Hartree-Fock
potential) used as the zero approximation.
In addition, the transition to
the formalism in which the role of the vacuum is played by closed shells
can simply be realized by changing the sign of i0 in the electron propagator
denominators corresponding to the closed shells.

3 One electron over closed shells

Let us consider an atom with one electron over closed shells. In the zero ap-
proximation the electrons of the atom interact with the potential V (r) which
can be chosen to include approximately the electron-electron interaction. In
the formalism with the closed shell states as well as the negative energy states
refered to the vacuum, the electron propagator is given by

The nuclear recoil correction is the sum of the one-electron and two-electron
contributions. Using the diagram technique rules from [15] and the Sec.
2 and the formula (17) one easily ﬁnds that the one-electron contribution
is equal to the sum of the expressions (28) for a and b states. The two-
electron contributions correspond to the diagrams shown in Fig. 4-6. The

The formulas (31)-(34) coincide with the related expressions found for
high-Z few-electron atoms in [11] (see also [7]). The diﬀerence is only
the present expressions (31)-(34) are not restricted to the case of the pure
Coulomb zero approximation.

5 Composite nuclear structure

The problem of the composite nuclear structure in the nuclear recoil theory
was ﬁrst discussed by Salpeter [6]. In Ref.
[6], it was shown that the cal-
culations based on the assumption that the nucleus is a point Dirac particle
Z and mass M are valid for composite nuclei (indepen-
of electric charge
dently of the nuclear spin), if the distance between the nuclear levels is large
compared with the distance between the atomic (electrons + ﬁeld) levels
contributing to the nuclear recoil eﬀect. In this section we consider how this
result can be derived within the approach developed in the present paper.

Let us assume, for simplicity, that the nucleus is a bound state of a two-
particle system (e.g., a core with a mass m1 and a charge e1 and a valent
nucleon with a mass m2 and a charge e2). In this case the sum of the last
three terms in equation (9) must be replaced by H1 + H2 + H3, where

consideration to the center-of-atom-mass system ( P = Pn + Pe + Pf = 0).
So, the total nuclear momentum Pn is given by the equation (11). In terms
of the variables Xn and xn the operator H2 can be represented in the form

and µ = (m1m2)/(m1 + m2). The Hamiltonian Hµ describes the intristic
states of the nucleus. Let us denote the wave function of the nuclear state
which is under the consideration by φa(xn). The wave function of the whole
system in the zero approximation is the product of φa(xn) and the atomic
wave function calculated using the operator
as the interaction

the nuclear energy levels is large compared with the distance between the

smaller than the atomic size, we expand the vector A in powers of xn. Taking
into account that φa(xn) is of a deﬁnite parity we ﬁnd to the lowest orders

Assuming that the energy diﬀerence between the nuclear state which is under
the consideration and the other nuclear states contributing to the sum in the
equation (45) is large compared with the corresponding energy diﬀerences
between the atomic (electrons + ﬁeld) states which give a dominant contri-
bution to ∆E′

So, within the approximations made in the derivation of this result, the eﬀects
of the composite nuclear structure can be neglected.

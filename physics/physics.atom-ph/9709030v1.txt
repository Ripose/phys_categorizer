Heating-Assisted Atom Transfer in the Scanning Tunneling Microscope

M. Grigorescu1

Abstract:

The eﬀect of the environmental interactions on the localization probability
for a Xe atom trapped in the surface-tip junction of the scanning tunneling
microscope is studied in the frame of a stochastic, non-linear Liouville equa-
tion for the density operator. It is shown that the irreversible transfer from
surface to tip may be explained by thermal decoherence rather than by the
driving force acting during the application of a voltage pulse.

1. Introduction

Since the ﬁrst experiments on reversible atom transfer [1], the scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) may be considered as the ideal instrument for
manipulating atoms or molecules. The bistable operation mode of STM indi-
cate that in a certain geometry the diﬀusion barrier on surface is high enough
to prevent the particle escape from the junction region, and the motion takes
place along the outer normal to the surface plane in an asymmetric, one-
dimensional, double-well potential (DWP) [2]. However, the mechanism of
irreversible atom transfer between the potential wells after the application of
a voltage pulse is not yet completely understood.

If the initial center of mass (CM) wave function of the atom is an isomeric
state of the static junction potential, then the barrier crossing appears only
in special resonance conditions, by quantum coherence oscillations (QCO)
[3]. The resonances with long oscillation periods require a very ﬁne tun-
ning of the bias voltage, which cannot be assumed in the present switching
experiments. Also, during QCO the tunneling has not an exponential law.
Therefore, is a most interesting issue to study the evolution of the atomic
CM wave packet dynamics during the voltage pulse, and the decoherence
eﬀects produced by the coupling with the environment. This coupling may
damp [4] or completely suppress [5] the QCO.

The appropriate frame for the treatment of a quantum dynamics deter-
mined both by the unitary evolution in the Hilbert space and by the change
in the purity of the states (of the occupation numbers), is provided by the
Liouville equation for the density operator. However, this equation can be
solved only for very simple systems, and in a physical situation is necessary
to ﬁnd suitable approximations.

The occupation numbers of the energy levels for a Xe atom in the STM
junction potential may change in time by the interactions with the electron
gas. A partial description of this process is given by the rate equations [2],
but for a realistic treatment is necessary to account also the dynamical eﬀects
related to the evolution of the non-stationary wave packets, as the QCO.

In this work, the eﬀect of environmental decoherence on the atom dy-
namics in the STM junction will be described phenomenologically using a
modiﬁed Liouville equation. This equation is presented in Sec. 2, and is
applied to calculate the transition rate induced by the thermal noise. In Sec.
3 are presented numerical results concerning the evolution of the localiza-

2

tion probability for a Xe atom. At zero temperature, the probability density
during a voltage pulse is determined by the evolution of the quantum wave
packet in a time-dependent external potential. This evolution is obtained by
solving numerically the Schr¨odinger equation, for symmetric triangular and
0.8 V at the peak. The environmental decoherence
trapezoidal pulses with
eﬀects are studied using the non-linear Liouville equation for the density op-
erator, at the temperature T = 4 K and a constant voltage U. Two values
of U are considered, one non-resonant, U =
1.141 V, corre-
sponding to the QCO resonance with the highest frequency. The conclusions
are summarized in Sec. 4.

The atom dynamics in the STM junction will be treated assuming that
the CM motion is restricted to the X-axis, normal to the surface, and the

potential energy V (x) has an asymmetric, double-well shape. Without exter-
nal bias, this potential is determined only by the binding interaction energy,
and the estimate provided in ref. [2] can be well approximated by the fourth
order polynomial

V0(x) = C0 + C1x + C2x2 + C3x3 + C4x4 ,

(16)

with C0 = 0.45 meV, C1 = 0.77 meV/˚A, C2 =

meV/˚A3, C4 = 44.51 meV/˚A4. The isomeric minimum of V0(x) is located
0.7 ˚A, near surface, the barrier top at xb = 0, while the stable

during the voltage peak, but the residual value after pulse is small. The
propagation in time up to 20 ns of the non-stationary wave packet created
by the pulse do not indicate further signiﬁcant changes in the evolution of ρ.
The extension of the upper time limit of the numerical integration to µs
or ms is not yet possible due to the large amount of computer time required.
Though, the present results suggest that after the moment when the pulse
vanishes, the residual probability of localization on the tip is small.

This behavior was obtained neglecting the dynamical eﬀects produced
by the coupling between the atom and the surrounding electron gas. The
average features of the atom-electron interaction are reﬂected by the jump
in the junction conductivity at the atom switching, and the potential energy
term containing the eﬀective charge, assumed above to be ﬁxed. Though,
the experiments on electromigration in metals show that the eﬀective charge
is an average quantity which depends on temperature [12]. Therefore, it may
0.1 e, such eﬀects
have thermal ﬂuctuations, and for a small value as Qef f ∼
could be important.

In the following, the ﬂuctuating part of Qef f will be treated phenomeno-
logically, assuming that it can be simulated by an additional dipole interac-
tion in the Hamiltonian, having a structure close to Hcoup of Eq. (1).

If the Xe atom adsorbed on the surface is thermally equilibrated, and the
barrier crossing proceeds by quantum tunneling, then for short times com-
pared to the recurrence time τR it could be possible to deﬁne the average
transfer rate [10]

where T ∗ is the eﬀective temperature, Ei are the energies of the isomeric
levels and λi the corresponding tunneling rates. However, if the system is
not equilibrated, and at t = 0 the CM wave function is a pure state ψ0, then
the transfer rate should be deﬁned by

4. Summary and conclusions

The atom transfer in the scanning tunneling microscope is a complex
non-stationary phenomenon, reﬂecting a dynamical interplay between uni-
tary evolution in Hilbert space and the environmental decoherence.

A phenomenological description of a quantum system interacting bilin-
early with a classical heat bath of harmonic oscillators is provided by the
modiﬁed Liouville equation presented in Sec. 1. This equation may be
derived from a variational principle (Eq.
(2)), and has a Langevin form,
containing stochastic and frictional terms.

The eﬀects of a voltage pulse on the localization probability ρ for a Xe
atom prepared initially in a pure state localized on the STM surface was
investigated by numerically integrating the TDSE (Eq.(18)). In these calcu-
lations the environmental interactions are neglected, and the voltage pulse is
assumed of symmetric triangular and trapezoidal shape. The results indicate
a stepwise increase of ρ at the moments when the pulse front is near a reso-
nant bias voltage for the isomeric ground state. The resonant values depend
0.08 V when Qef f = 0,
on the eﬀective charge, being equally spaced by
0.04 V when Qef f = 0.08 e. However, the evolution of the non-
and by
stationary state created by the pulse do not indicate an asymptotic behavior
characteristic to exponential decay.

The atom dynamics at ﬁnite temperature was investigated in the frame
of the stochastic, non-linear Liouville equation (Eq. (3)). The spectrum of
the environmental noise was assumed to be ﬂat (white noise), parameterized
by the static friction coeﬃcient γ. This has a value corresponding to weak
damping, and the eﬀective temperature was considered the same as the en-
vironmental temperature, T = 4 K.

The ensemble average of the energy increases during tunneling, (Fig.3(B)
and 4(B)), but within the time interval of 100 ps investigated here the atom
is not thermalized. The evolution of << ρ >> at resonance (U =
1.141
V), consists of an incoherent superposition between damped QCO and expo-
nential decay. In the non-resonant case (U =
0.8 V) the tunneling law is
close to exponential, with a rate proportional to the product γT (Eq. (15)).
This result can provide a basis for understanding the current dependence of
the atom transfer rate, because the friction coeﬃcient as well as the eﬀective
temperature should be functions of the electron tunneling current.

Abstract. Four atom optics experiments that each serve to measure atom-surface interactions
near nanofabricated gratings are presented here. In these experiments atoms in a beam travel
within 25 nm of a material grating bar, and the analysis incorporates phase shifts for the atomic
de Broglie waves due to interactions betwen Na atoms and silicon nitride surfaces. One atom
diﬀraction experiment determines the van der Waals coeﬃcient C3 = 2.7±0.8 meVnm3, and
one atom interferometer experiment determines C3 = 4±1 meVnm3. The results of all four
experiments are consistent with the Lifshitz prediction that is explicitly calculated here for Na-
silicon nitride to be C3 = 3.25 meVnm3. The four atom optics experiments and review of van
der Waals theory are complemented by similar experiments using electron beams and analysis
of image-charge eﬀects.

1. Introduction
Ten nm away from a surface the potential energy for an atom is approximately 3 µeV, and
for an electron it is about 10,000 times larger. More precisely, the van der Waals potential for
sodium atoms and the image-charge potential for electrons both depend on the permittivity of
the surface material; both potentials are also aﬀected by surface charges, surface coatings, and
surface geometry. Precise knowledge of the potential close to real surfaces is now needed for
understanding atom optics experiments and nanotechnology devices, yet measurements of atom-
surface interaction strengths have only been made for a few systems so far. Here we present four
atom optics experiments that serve to measure the potential energy for atoms due to a surface
located within 25 nm. Comparison to theoretical values of the non-retarded atom-surface van
der Waals interaction will be made in the discussion.

Our experiments are based on coherent transmission of sodium atom de Broglie waves through
an array of 50 nm wide channels in a silicon nitride nanostructure grating. Transmitted atoms
pass within 25 nm to a grating bar surface, and remain this close for only 10−10 sec. Even in
this short time, interactions with the channel walls modify the phase of the atom waves. Phase
front curvature on the nanometer scale has the observed eﬀect of modifying the phase Φn and
amplitude |An| in each far-ﬁeld diﬀraction order. We measured atom diﬀraction intensities and
atom interferometer fringe phase shifts in order to determine the potential for sodium atoms
induced by surfaces of silicon nitride.

For comparison we used the same nanostructure gratings to diﬀract electron beams. Despite
the 10,000 times larger potential energy (at 10 nm) due to image-charge eﬀects, electron
diﬀraction shows similar features to atom diﬀraction as a result of stronger interactions with the
surface over shorter time scales.

2. Nanostructure Gratings
The 100-nm period gratings were fabricated by T.A. Savas at MIT using photolithography
with standing waves of UV laser light. The etch procedures used to create the silicon nitride
nanostructures are described in [1]. The bars are free-standing trapezoidal columns and their
dimensions have been measured to an accuracy of 1.5 nm using scanning electron microscope
(SEM) images such as those shown in Figures 1 and 2.

standing silicon nitride bars appear light in
this image. Image courtesy of T.A. Savas at
the MIT NanoStructures Laboratory.

Note the trapezoidal bar proﬁle. Bars in this
region are not free standing, but are attached
to a substrate. Image courtesy of T.A. Savas.

To understand how van der Waals interactions modify the amplitude and phase of diﬀracted
atom waves, we consider three steps. First, a model for the potential in all space around the
grating bars is needed. Second, the phase shift and absorption for atom waves transmitted
through this potential is calculated as a function of position. Finally, the propagation to the
far-ﬁeld is given by a Fourier transform of the transmission function.

To begin, we approximate the potential in each channel by a sum of van der Waals potentials

for an atom and two inﬁnite planes,

V (r) = −C3

r3

(cid:18)

+

r3
2 (cid:19)

where r1 and r2 are the distances along the normals to the walls of the channel, and r will be
deﬁned in terms of the coordinates ξ and z. Because of the trapezoidal shape of the bars, the
channel walls are not parallel. We also considered the potential due to a sum of uncorrelated
atom-atom interactions between a beam atom and all the atoms that compose the grating. The
potential energy landscape calculated this way is shown in Figure 3 and the marginal validity
of this approach will be discussed later.

The phase shift for atom waves transmitted through the channel can be computed in the

WKB approximation,

φ(ξ) =

Z s

2m
¯h2 [E − V (ξ, z)]dz

where m is the atomic mass, E is the total atomic energy, and V (ξ, z) is the van der Waals
potential energy. The coordinate axes ξ and z are deﬁned in Figures 3 and 4. Curved wave
fronts due to φ(ξ) are shown in Figure 4 given a plane wave incident on the gratings. With

where T () is the transmission function, ξ is measured from the center of each window and rect()

a sum of diﬀraction orders

where kg = 2π/d is the grating wavenumber, w is the size of each window between the grating
bars, and L(x) is the line shape of the atom beam in the detector plane, and xn is the
displacement of the nth diﬀraction order given by xn = zdetnλdB/d. In our experiment zdet = 2.4
m, d = 100 nm, and λdB can range from 270 pm (for 600 m/s Na atoms) to 54 pm (for 3000
m/s Na atoms). More formal derivations of ψ(x) are given in [2, 3] from our group and in [4, 5]
from the Toennies group which uses a slightly diﬀerent description of the atom optics theory.

The phase (Φn) and amplitude (|An|) of each diﬀraction order are both functions of the
potential strength (C3), the atom velocity (v), grating window size (w), grating period (d),
grating thickness (t), and grating bar wedge angle (α). For typical values (v = 2000 m/s,
w = 55 nm, d = 100 nm, t = 150 nm, and α = 5o) theoretical plots of |An(C3)| and Φn(C3) are
shown in Figures 5 and 6.

3. Atom and Electron Diﬀraction Experiments
Diﬀraction data displayed in Figure 7 permit us to measure the intensities |An|2 and the
mean atom beam velocity, as well as the velocity distribution. When combined with SEM
measurements of the grating geometry, a single diﬀraction pattern is suﬃcient to determine C3,
because the values of |An|2 depend on C3 as shown in Eqs. 1, 2 and 5.

ﬁxed parameters (v = 2000 m/s, w = 55 nm,

Ideally, we would like to manipulate C3 and verify experimentally that this changes |An|.
Instead, we studied how each |An| for n=(0 to 5) depends on atomic velocity. For example,
Figures 7 and 8 show diﬀerent diﬀraction intensities (|An|2) for two diﬀerent velocity Na beams.
As expected, the diﬀraction angle changes too, and this permits us to measure v. To ﬁrst order
in V (r)/E the parameters C3t/v are grouped together in φ(ξ) and therefore |An| are aﬀected in
a similar way by changing v or C3. This experiment is described in [3].

We emphasize here that if C3 = 0, the nano structure would be purely an absorbing grating,
and the |An| would not change with atom velocity. It is the van der Waals interaction that gives
the gratings a complex transmission function, and makes |An| depend on incident atom velocity.
With least squared ﬁts to |An| we determined C3 = 2.7 ± 0.8 meVnm3. We also veriﬁed using
χ2that the 1/r3 form of the potential gives the best ﬁt to the data.

In our second experiment we observed how the intensities |An|2 vary when the grating is
rotated as shown in Figures 9 and 10 and described in [2]. Due to the thickness of the grating

shown with dashed lines in Figure 10. However, a better ﬁt to the data is obtained using the
theory for |An| described in [2] (similar to Eq. 5) with C3 = 5 meVnm3. This produces the
solid lines in Figure 10. We also observe asymmetric diﬀraction patterns, i.e. blazed diﬀraction,
in this experiment, and our model reproduces this result. Asymmetric phase proﬁles φ(ξ) for
de Broglie waves transmitted through each window are provided by a combination of three
ingredients: non-normal incidence, trapezoidal bar shape, and non-zero C3. We observe even
more asymmetric diﬀraction patterns with electron beams as discussed next.

We found that electron diﬀraction with nanostructure gratings is also aﬀected by the surfaces
as far as 20 nm away, similar to the way van der Waals interactions modify atom diﬀraction.
To keep the grating bars from getting charged by the electron beam we coated them with 1 nm
of gold. Near this gold-coated silicon nitride surface, electrons have an electrostatic potential
energy that we calculate from the method of images to be

in Gaussian units, where ǫ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity compared to that of free
space and e is the charge of the electron and as before, r1 is the distance to one wall. Using this
image-charge potential we calculated the phase shift φ(ξ) and thus the diﬀraction amplitudes
|An| for electrons. Figure 11 shows electron diﬀraction data and a theoretical diﬀraction pattern
based on Equations 2, 5, and 6, using best ﬁt parameters ǫ = 4, and an angle of incidence 5
degrees. Note that if the image-charge eﬀect were not included then the model for |An|2 in
Figure 11 would be symmetric about the zeroth order.

Twenty nm away from this surface the potential for electrons is 0.02 eV as compared to the
atom-wall potential of 0.4 µeV. This is 50,000 times larger for electrons than for sodium atoms.
However, the phase shift φ(ξ) near ξ = 20 nm is similar for electrons and atoms because the
velocity of 500 eV electrons (13,000 km/s) is four orders of magnitude larger than that for 0.12
eV sodium atoms (1 km/s).

4. Atom Interferometer Experiments
In addition to the diﬀraction amplitudes |An|, there are diﬀraction phases Φn in each order.
We measured the phase shift in the zeroth order (Φ0) due to transmission through a removable
interaction grating (IG) with an interferometer [6]. The geometry of this experiment is shown
in Figure 12, and permits us to study the interference fringes as a function of the IG position.
Interference fringe data are shown in Figure 13 for the cases of the IG obscuring either path I,
path II, or neither. The directly measured phase shift, Φmeas = 0.22 ± 0.02 radians, is consistent
with C3 = 4 ± 1 meVnm3. A more detailed discussion of how to determine Φ0 and C3 from the
measured phase shift is given in a separate entry of the CAMS conference proceedings by J.D.
Perreault and in reference [6].

We also measured the phase diﬀerence Φ2 − Φ1 = 0.6±0.4 radians, by comparing the relative
phases of four separate interferometers formed by adjacent pairs of the n = (−2, −1, 0, 1, 2)
diﬀraction orders of the ﬁrst interferometer grating. This phase diﬀerence can be compared to
that predicted in Figure 6 and is consistent with C3 = 4 meVnm3.

here (red circles). Theoretical predictions
based on diﬀerent descriptions of the atom
and the surface are shown (blue squares).

To compare our measurements with theory, we reviewed calculations of C3 for sodium atoms

and various surfaces as shown in Figure 15. The Lifshitz formula [7] for C3 is

C3 =

where α(iω) is the polarizability of the atom and ǫ(iw) is the permittivity of the surface. For a
perfect conductor (ǫ=∞) and sodium atoms, Derevianko et al. [8] calculated C3 = 7.60 meVnm3
and noted that 16% of this value is due to the core electrons. A single Lorentz oscillator model
for an atom with no damping gives the polarizability:

α(iω) =

ǫ(iω) =

For sodium atoms α(0) = 0.0241 nm3 [9] and ω0 = 2πc/(590 nm). Combining this with (ǫ=∞)
in Eq. 7 gives C3 = ¯hω0α(0)/8 = 6.3 meVnm3. This agrees with the non-retarded limit in [10].
For a metal surface, the Drude model describes ǫ(iω) with the plasma frequency and damping:

For sodium metal, ¯hωp = 5.8 eV and ¯hγ = 23meV, resulting in C3 = 4.1 meV nm3 for a sodium
atom and a bulk sodium surface. For an insulating surface Bruhl et al [5] used a model with

and ¯hω0 ≡ Es = 13 eV and g0 = 0.588 for silicon nitride. Using this expression and the
one-oscillator model for sodium atoms yields C3 = 3.25 meVnm3.

where x is the atom-surface distance. Using the London result for C6 = (3/4)¯hω0α(0)2 [11] and
the number density of bulk sodium for N gives a value for C3 = 12.3 meVnm3 (also, if N is
replaced by α(0)−1, this calculation gives C3 = π¯hω0α(0)/8 = 19.6meVnm3). The value using
the pairwise sum is three times larger than the value (4.1 meVnm3) obtained for the same atom-
surface system using Eqs.7, 8, and 9. The diﬀerent values obtained with these two approaches

that maximize the FOM if C3 = 0. The thin curve
is for windows (w1=93, w2=88, w2=37 nm) that
maximize the FOM for C3 = 3 meVnm3. These
calculations are for Na atoms with v = 100 m/s.

6. Conclusion
We used nanostructure gratings with 50-nm wide channels between free-standing bars in four
experiments to measure the strength of atom-surface interactions. We detected phase shifts and
intensity changes for atom beams that we attribute to van der Waals interactions with the walls
of a nanostructure grating. A model based on complex transmission functions for de Broglie
wave optics can explain both atom and electron diﬀraction patterns.

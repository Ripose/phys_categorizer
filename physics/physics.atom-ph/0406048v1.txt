ATOMIC PHYSICS: COMPUTER
CALCULATIONS AND
THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

Abstract

It is demonstrated, how the theoretical analysis preceding the nu-
merical calculations helps to calculate the energy of the ground state of
helium atom, and enables to avoid qualitative errors in calculations of
the characteristics of double photoionization.

1 Introduction

As it stands now, many of the publications devoted to interaction of photons
and electrons with atoms and molecules have similar structure. In the ﬁrst step
a most general quantum mechanics formula for the cross section is written. In
the next step the most ”accurate” numerical functions for the bound state
electrons are found. Since the binding energy can be determined with high
accuracy, the wave functions pass the test for reproducing the binding energies
with a good accuracy. In the next step computer is at work. Sometimes there
is a possibility to try the inﬂuence of the ﬁnal state interactions. The usual
choices are: plane waves, Coulomb functions...

About twenty years ago such approach was justiﬁed to some extent. Most
calculations were connected with the characteristics, which could be detected
in the experiments. In the real experiments the targets obtained the energies
of the order of the electron binding energies. There was no small parameter,
and thus no possibility to evaluate the equations, determined by the original

1

formalism of quantum mechanics. The part of atomic physics, related to the
real experiments was indeed becoming the science about the precise compu-
tations. The near-threshold behavior of the processes, where one could ﬁnd a
small parameter, was rather an exception.

The situation changed at the end of 80-th, when new synchrotron sources
of the photons became available. The experiments with the photon energies of
about 10 keV went on. For the light atoms these energies are much larger then
the binding energies. A small parameter emerged in the theoretical problems,
which could be of practical importance.

The general approach to the ”high energy atomic physics” can be based
on the works of Bethe [1]. A somewhat modernized presentation is given in
[2, 3]. Being initially formulated for the electron-atomic scattering, these prin-
ciples can be expanded to any process of the interaction between the high
energy particles with the bound systems. The wording ”high energy” means
that the energy exceeds strongly the binding energy of the system. The cross-
sections of such processes can be expressed through certain parameters of the
bound systems. The interactions between the fast and slow participants can
be treated as perturbation. Each act of transferring of large momentum leads
to a parametrically small factor. In the region, where the processes are kine-
matically allowed for the free electrons, a small momentum q of the order of
the average momentum of the bound electron η is transferred to the nucleus.
The processes outside this kinematical region ( which we shall refer to as Bethe
surface) require large momentum q ≫ η to be transferred to the nucleus. The
processes outside the Bethe surface are thus strongly quenched.

Hence, the amplitudes of the high energy atomic physics processes depend

on the parameter

On the Bethe surface κ is of the order of unity, while κ ≪ 1 outside the Bethe
surface. Using the system of units with ¯h = c = 1, we can write for the lowest
state of the hydrogenlike atom

(1)

(2)

with m being the electron mass, α = 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant, while
Z is the charge of the nucleus. We shall use this relation for estimations in the
many-electron cases as well.

The perturbative treatment of the fast electrons, which is another point of
the Bethe theory, leads to certain misunderstandings sometimes. The sections

κ = η/q .

η = mαZ ,

2

”Perturbation theory” of the textbooks on quantum mechanics often treat
only the short-ranged forces.
Indeed, iteration series term of the Lippman-
Schwinger equation for the electron wave function in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the
nucleus contains the infrared-divergent terms. In this sense, there is no such
thing as ”perturbative series for the Coulomb ﬁeld” and the words ” the fast
electrons can be described by the plane waves ” become confusing. However,
the solution was found long ago. It was guessed by Dalitz [4] and proved by
Gorshkov [5], that the divergent terms compose the factor exp(iΦ) with real Φ
in the amplitudes, thus cancelling in the cross-sections. Hence a way to solve
the problem is to present the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the nucleus in the form
V (r) = −αZe−λr/r with λ → 0. Now the Lippman- Schwinger equation and
the perturbative theory become legitimate, while the terms which depend on
λ (i.e. lnλ) cancel in the cross-sections.

The perturbation parameter of the nonrelativistic electron with the three-

dimensional momentum p, moving in the Coulomb ﬁeld is [6]

ξZ = mαZ/p .

(3)

The condition ξZ ≪ 1 means that the relative contribution provided by this
interaction to the electron wave function is much smaller than unity [6]. Since
diﬀerent regions of distances may be important for diﬀerent terms of the ex-
pansion of the wave function, one should be careful and expand the amplitude
in powers of ξZ. The small distances are connected with transferring of large
momentum q ≫ η to the nucleus. This process can be considered as pertur-
bation as well, with κ4 ≪ 1 being the parameter of expansion-Eq(1).

However, one often ﬁnds large deviations between the calculations with
the plane waves and Coulomb ﬁeld functions applied for the description of the
continuum electrons, even at large values of energies. Sometimes this leads
to the statement that ”plane wave approximation never works”. However,
as explained in [7], there are two parameters, which depend on the electron
momentum p. Besides the parameter ξ2
Z which is the true parameter of the
expansion of the wave function at the distances of the order of the size of
the atom, there is a parameter πξZ, which enters through the normalization
factor of the Coulomb wave function anyway. In the processes with the large
momentum transferred to the nucleus, there are some more terms, containing
the parameter πξZ. Fortunately, they also compose a factor. Thus, assuming

πξZ ≈ 1,

ξ2
Z ≪ 1

(4)

one can carry out expansion in powers of ξ2
Z. Also, the factors depending on
the parameter πξZ cancel in the ratios of the cross sections of the processes

3

containing the high energy electrons with the close values of energies. The
recent calculations, presented in [8] illustrated the general validity of the latter
statement.

The attempts to include the ﬁnal state interactions of the outgoing electrons
in a straightforward way also met some diﬃculties, caused by the long-range
nature of the interaction. The approach which enabled to include the e − e
interaction in the lowest order of the parameter of their interaction

ξ2 = (mα)2/p2
r,

(5)

with pr being the linear momentum of the relative motion was worked out in
[9].

Since the high-energy experiments were not available in atomic physics
for a long time, these ideas were not applied much. The only group which
systematically used and developed the approach was that of V. G. Gorshkov
and his collaborators [10], who focused on the Coulomb ﬁeld calculations.

Now one can conclude that it is not enough to require that the bound state
wave function provides an accurate energy value. It should provide the ade-
quate description of the electron density on the distances, which are important
for the considered process. If the process is not allowed for the free electrons,
the important distances can be of minor importance for determination of the
binding energy. In treating the ﬁnal states one can use the perturbative expan-
sions in powers of ξ2
Z, ξ2 and κ2, taking care that all the terms of the leading
order are picked in the amplitude.

It looks to me, that the story of investigation of the double photoionization
of helium provides good illustrations of how the application of this approach
enabled to obtain the results. It illustrates also, how ignoring of these ideas
led to the erroneous results. The theory gave two lessons: at the end of 60-th
and at the end of 90-th. The relativistic aspects of the problems will not be
touched. I will show , how the main results can be obtained by the standard
I will show also, that the
methods of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.
Lippman- Schwinger equation appears to be a powerful tool. However, I start
with the example of a static problem of the calculation of the ground state
binding energy of the helium atom.

2 Calculation of the ground state energy of

helium atom

The binding energy of the ground state of helium atom is known from the
experiments with very high precision. The relative accuracy was 10−6 in late
50-th [2]. It is about 2 · 10−7 today [11]. This stimulated the attempts to solve
the Schr¨odinger equation for the helium ground state as precisely as possible.

The Hartree-Fock (HF) method, developed in early 30-th, reproduces the
value of the binding energy with the relative error of about 1.5%. The experi-
ments are much more precise. The reasons of this failure are known. The HF
function does not depend on the distance between the electrons. The proba-
bility to ﬁnd the two electrons to be close to each other is thus overestimated
in HF approach.

An alternative approach was developed in the same years as the HF method.
It consists in employing approximate wave functions ψa(r1, r2, r12), presented
by explicit analytical formulas. Here r1, r2 denote the distances between the
electron and the nucleus, r12 is the distance between the electrons. The lower
index a stands for ”approximate”. These functions contain a number of pa-
rameters. The values of the parameters are chosen to minimize the expectation
value

E = hψa|H|ψai ,

of the Hamiltonian H of the helium atom. The simplest example is the product
of two hydrogenlike functions in the ﬁeld of the nucleus with certain ”eﬀec-
tive nuclear charge” Ze. The eﬀective charge plays the role of the variation
parameter. In this case

ψa(r1, r2) = ψh(r1)ψh(r2),

with the well known analytic expression for ψh(r) = e−ar, a = mαZe. ( All
the wave functions are normalized to ψ(0) = 1).The solution Ze = 27/16 [6]
provides the energy value with the error of 2%.

More complicated functions of the form

ψa(r1, r2) = e−a(r1+r2)P (r1, r2, r12)

with a and the coeﬃcients of the polynomial

P (r1, r2, r12) = Σcijkri

being the variation parameters, have been used since late 20-th. The earlier
versions contained 3 parameters. By the end of 50-th the functions with more
than 200 parameters were employed [2]. The functions P , containing also the
dependence on the ratios
have been used. This enabled to
obtain the convergence of the results to a certain value, interpreted as the true
energy value, with the precision of several units of 10−10, reproducing 5 signs
in the value of the binding energy ( The calculations with the accuracy better
then 10−4 require the account of the ﬁnite mass and motion of the nucleus,
inclusion of relativistic corrections, etc).

However, Barlett et al. [12] showed that the functions (8), with P having a
polynomial structure could not satisfy the Scr¨odinger equation for the ground
state of helium. Such solution does not exist since it does not have a proper
limit at the triple coalescence point r1 = r2 = r12 = 0. The functions which
treated the three-particle singularity of the Hamiltonian were found by Fock
[13]. They took the form

P (r1, r2, r12) = Σcijknri

1rj

2rk

12[ln(r2

1 + r2)2]n,

(10)

thus containing the logarithmic terms. (Usually, the Fock function is presented
by using the hyperspherical variables [14]).

Inclusion of the logarithmic terms has little eﬀect on the energy value.
However, account of these terms improves the convergence of the variation
calculations. Also, inclusion of such terms enables to diminish the number
of variation parameters. For example, the calculation with the accuracy 10−9
required 1078 parameters of the function (9), while it was suﬃcient to use the
function (10) with 52 parameters to achieve the same precision [15]. Further-
more, as noted by Myers et al. [16], for some of the functions (9) the variation
procedure chooses the parameters in such a way, that the expansion mimicked
the function (10) with a smaller number of parameters.

Behavior of the true ground state wave function Ψ(r1, r2, r12) at the two-
particle coalescence points is determined by the Kato cusp conditions [17]. In
the point of electron-nucleus coalescence r1 = 0 it is

while in the electron-electron coalescence point r12 = 0 it is

with r0 = 1
mα standing for the Bohr radius. Equations (11,12) can be viewed
as the conditions of the cancellation of the singular terms in the Schr¨odinger
equation.

Let us illustrate this, considering the single-electron wave function ψ(r) of
the bound electron in 1s state of certain eﬀective ﬁeld U(r), which approx-
imates the interactions with the nucleus and with the other electrons. The
Schr¨odinger equation for this case is

Thus, U(r → 0) ∼ − αZ

(15)

at r → 0. Similar analysis of the Schr¨odinger equation for the atom of helium
leads to Eqs.(11),(12). Note, that these relations could have been obtained
immediately after the Schr¨odinger equation was written in 1926. Surprisingly,
they were found only thirty years later.

The proper treatment of the two-particle singularity is even more important
than the account of the three-particle one [16]. This is because the three
particle coalescence point is felt in the smaller volume of integration of the
matrix element (6). Myers et al. [16] suggested the simplest form of the wave
function, which satisﬁes both Kato conditions

ψa(r1, r2, r12) = e−a(r1+r2)+br12

(16)

with a = mαZ, b = mα
2 . It is amusing that this function, which does not con-
tain ﬁtting parameters , provides the same precision in determination of the
binding energy, as the function (7), which contains a variation parameter Ze.
The function (16) knows nothing about the three-particle singularity. The sim-
plest function, which would account both two- and three-particle singularities
is described by a more complicated formula, also presented in [16].

7

If the approximate wave function is chosen in a proper form, the variation
procedure exhibits the tendency to ﬁnd the parameters, providing small errors
in the Kato conditions (11,12). The wave functions

ψa(r1, r2, r12) = e−a(r1+r2)+br12Σcijkri

1rj

12,

(17)

(i + j + k ≤ N) analyzed by Teng and Shakeshaft [18] provide the relative
errors of about 6% and 25% in Eqs.(11, 12) correspondingly, even in the case
of 4 parameters (N=1). Although the Kato conditions are satisﬁed only ap-
proximately, it helps in improving the convergence. The function (17) with 14
parameters (N=4) provides the value of the binding energy with the relative
deviation 3 · 10−5 from the one, obtained with the functions, described by Eqs
(8,9) and containing 210 parameters [2].

In the nowadays studies the subject of investigation is usually not only the

expectation value (6), but also the local energy functional

E(~r1, ~r2) =

Hψa
ψa

,

(18)

which gives more detailed information about the relation of the approximate
function ψa to the true wave function Ψ. Another improvement consists in
developing the approaches, based on direct solution of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. In one of the methods, suggested by Haftel and Mandelzweig ( see [19],
where the other methods are also discussed) the wave function is presented as
a product of a correlation factor, describing the coalescence points singulari-
ties and a smooth function, expanded in a series of hyperspherical harmonic
functions. The detailed description of these points is beyond the scope of this
lecture.

I hope that this Section made one convinced that taking care of the proper
analytical structure of the approximate wave functions, one obtains the better
results. Now we shall see that this becomes increasingly important for the
dynamical problems.

3 Asymptotics of the double photoionization

cross section: ω−7/2 or ω−5/2 ?

The double photoionization of the ground state of helium is studied since the
late 50-th. The process provides a direct probe of three-body physics, since the

8

three charged particles are involved. A huge number of experimental results
gives a good possibility for theoreticians to test their approaches.

The mechanism, which determines the main contribution to the nonrela-
tivistic asymptotics of the cross section σ2+(ω) with ω standing for the photon
energy, was clariﬁed by Kabir and Salpiter [20]. At the values of ω, exceeding
strongly the binding energy I, the process can be viewed as a single photoion-
ization, followed by the transition of the second electron to continuum. The
latter process takes place due to the change of the Hamiltonian of the system.
This is the analog of the shake-oﬀ (), suggested by Feinberg [21] for the de-
scription of ionization during the nuclear beta decay, due to the sudden change
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, caused by the change of the charge of the nucleus.
However, using the same wording shake-oﬀ, one must remember, that, in con-
trast to the beta decay, the mechanism can not be treated as due to the sudden
change of certain eﬀective ﬁeld. Byron and Joachain [22] showed that, being
attributed to the sudden change of self-consistent (Hartree-Fock) ﬁeld, the
mechanism underestimates the asymptotic value by a factor of 3. The initial
state correlations beyond the eﬀective ﬁeld are thus of crucial importance.

The electron, which interacts with the photon directly, absorbs most of the
energy ǫ1 ≈ ω. The secondary electron carries the energy of the order of the
binding energy ǫ2 ∼ I ≪ ω. Thus, the energy dependence of the amplitude
and of the cross section of the high energy nonrelativistic photoionization are
the same, as that for the single photoionization process.

Recall now the mechanism of single ionization.

3.1 Asymptotics of the single photoionization

Here we assume that the electrons are described by the single-particle wave
functions. The general expression for the amplitude of ionization of 1s state is

(21)

Here the functions ψF are the Fourier transforms of the functions ψ. The
process requires that momentum

~Q = ~k − ~p1

(22)

1/2m ≫ I, while the binding energy I = η2

is transferred to the recoil ion. Note, that the energy of the fast electron
ǫ1 = p2
2m , with η standing for the
average momentum of the bound electron. Thus, ǫ1 ≫ I means, that p1 ≫ η,
i.e. the momentum of the fast electron is much larger than that of the bound
electron. Also, the energy dependence of the photon and electron momenta are
k = ω and p1 ≈ (2mω)1/2. Hence, Q ≫ η in this process. The large momentum
(i.e. momentum, exceeding strongly the average value for the bound electron)
should be transferred to the recoil ion.

Start with the plane wave

ψF p1(~q) = ψ(0)

F p1(~q) = (2π)3δ(~p1 − ~q),

(23)

for the description of the ﬁnal state electron. In this case all momentum Q is
transferred to the recoil ion by the initial state electron. The contribution to
the amplitude is

at p1 ≫ η can be obtained explicitly. One can expect the p−4
1 behavior to
be true in the general case, since the momenta p1 ≫ η correspond to small
distances r ≪ η−1, where an electron function ψ has a hydrogenlike shape.
Anyway, this can be proved rigorously, and the pre-asymptotic coeﬃcient can
be calculated. Since the s state wave function does not depend on the direction
of the vector ~r, we can evaluate

To get convinced, that Eq.(25) indeed presents the asymptotics of the am-
plitude, let us try to include the interactions between the outgoing electron and
the recoil ion. The lowest order perturbative correction to the outgoing elec-
tron wave function, caused by interaction with the nucleus V Ccan be obtained
by using the standard formula of quantum mechanics

to the amplitude. In the amplitude F +
1 both initial and ﬁnal state can transfer
large momenta q or p1 − q to the nucleus. The small factor of the order p−4
is partially compensated by the large phase volume of integration of the order
1, multiplied by the factor mαZ. Thus, the amplitude F +
p3
1 is indeed ξZ times
smaller then F +

0 , dropping faster with the increasing photon energy.
Thus, corrections to asymptotics provide the terms O(ξZ), dropping as
ω1/2. The large numerical coeﬃcient π can be understood, e.g. by considering
the procedure of normalization of the function ψp1(r) = ψ(0)
p1 (r).

from −iln(−1) = π if the integral J is evaluated in the complex plane. Hence,
the amplitude F +

to the well known asymptotics of the cross section [23]

Because of the large corrections of the order πξZ, the nonrelativistic asymp-

tic treatment becomes important at the energies far below the nonrelativistic
asymptotic region.

3.2 Asymptotics of double photoionization. Spurious

controversy

The general expression for the double photoionization amplitude can be written
as

F 2+ = hΨf |γ|Ψii,

with Ψi and Ψf standing for the exact wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal
states, while

γ = γ1 + γ2;

γj = i

(~e~∇j)
m

describes the interactions of the photon with the two-electron system. The
asymptotics of the amplitude [20] is determined by the interactions in the
initial state, which transfer small energy ǫ2 ∼ I to the secondary electron.
Large momentum

~Q = ~k − ~p1 − ~p2

is transferred to the nucleus.

To obtain the asymptotics, we can describe the ﬁnal state by the product
of the single-particle functions, putting Ψf (~r1, ~r2) = ψ(0)
p2(~r2). Here ψC
stands for the continuum wave function in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus,
while ψ(0) denotes its lowest order of expansion in powers of ξZ (the plane
wave). Since p1 ≫ p2, we can put γ = γ1.

p1 (~r1)ψC

Analysis, similar to the one, carried out in the previous subsection, provides

F 2+ = (4πα)1/2 (~e~p1)
m Z

d3q
(2π)3 ψC∗

p2 (~q)ΨF (~p1, ~q).

(35)

The integral on the rhs is saturated by small q ∼ η ≪ p1. The calculation,
similar to the one presented by (25), provides ΨF (p1, q) ∼ p−4
1 at p1 ≫ η. Thus,
at p2 ∼ η the dependence of F 2+ on the photon energy is the same as that of
F +. The integral over the energy distribution is saturated by ǫ2 ∼ I and thus
does not depend on the photon energy. Hence, the double photoionization

12

cross section σ2+ obtains the same energy dependence as the single ionization
cross section, i.e.

σ2+(ω) = C2ω−7/2

(36)

In paper [22] the double photoionization cross section was calculated by
employing the product of the Coulomb functions for the description of the
ﬁnal state. The asymptotics was obtained by expansion of the amplitude in
powers of ξZ. It was noted that the result depends on the form, assumed for
the operator of interaction between the photon and electrons. For the exact
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation the velocity form, presented by Eq.(33)
is equivalent to the length form

γ = γ1 + γ2;

γj = iωf i(~e~rj)

(37)

with ωf i being the diﬀerence of the energies of the ﬁnal and initial states, ωf i =
ω in our case. While the velocity form provided the asymptotics presented by
Eq.(36), the length form gave

σ2+(ω) = C L

2 ω−5/2.

(38)

To understand this, note that since p2 ≪ p1, the important space region is
r1 ≪ r2. Thus we can put γ = iω(~e~r2). Unlike the single photoionization,
the electron, which interacts with the photon directly, does not obtain angular
momentum. The double photoionization amplitude takes the form

F 2+ = (4πα)1/2ω

p1 (q1)ψC∗

p2 (q2)(eq2)ΨF (q1, q2).

If we describe the fast outgoing electron by the plane wave – Eq.(23), the
dependence of the amplitude on the momentum of the fast electron p1 ∼
(2mω)1/2 is determined by the factor

ωΨF (p1, q2) ∼

ω
p4

(40)

containing additional energy dependent factor ω1/2, compared to Eq.(24). This
leads to Eq.(38) for the asymptotics of the cross section. In the calculations
of [22] such behavior remained true, when the fast electron was described by
the Coulomb ﬁeld function.

The authors of [22] suggested that the ω−5/2 result is spurious, and that
the corresponding contribution should vanish if the exact wave function are
used. This guess was proved by ˚Aberg several years later [24].

3.3 Solution of the controversy

Here I present a simple derivation of the main results of [24]. Large momentum
Q ≈ p1 can be transferred to the nucleus either by the initial state electron,
or by the ﬁnal state electron. In the length form each of these mechanisms,
being treated separately, provides the contribution of the same order in the
parametric expansion. The wave function of the outgoing electron can be
described by the superposition of the plane wave and the lowest order Coulomb
correction. Electron interactions in the ﬁnal state as well as the higher order
Coulomb corrections contribute beyond the asymptotics. The two terms of the
expansion of the ﬁnal state wave function provide the two contributions to the
amplitude F 2+

integral, corresponding to A1 is saturated by small momenta q1 ∼ η. This can
be seen immediately from Eq.(27), which presents the function ψ(1)
F p1 explicitly.
The momentum q1 can be neglected everywhere, except the wave function ΨF .

are dominated by diﬀerent regions of the space distances r1. While A0 is
determined by small r1 ∼ p−1
1 , much larger distances r1 ∼ η−1 provide the
main contribution to A1.

Treated separately, each of the terms A0,1 would provide ω−5/2 law for the
cross section. However, carrying out the inverse Fourier transform, one ﬁnds
A0 + A1 = 0 for any q2 due to the Kato condition (11), and thus

L0 + F 2+
F 2+

L1 = 0 .

(48)

This shows, how the straightforward calculations in the length form, em-
ploying the approximate wave functions, which do not satisfy Eq.(11), provide
the spurious ω−5/2 asymptotics for the double photoionization cross section.

3.4 The Lippman-Schwinger equation

In this subsection I show that the Lippman-Schwinger equation (LSE) is a
convenient tool for the asymptotical analysis. The general form of LSE for the
two-electron system is

Ψ = Ψ(0) + GǫV Ψ .

(49)

Here V stands for the interaction, ǫ denotes the energy value, corresponding
to the solution Ψ of the Schr¨odinger equation, Ψ(0) and Gǫ are the solution
and the Green function for V = 0 (free motion).

To simplify the notations, let us write the LSE for the single-particle wave
function ψ, which we assume to be the exact solution of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion in a certain eﬀective ﬁeld U(r). It is

Now Gǫ is the free single-particle Green function. In the momentum space

bound state wave function ψF (p) at large momenta p ≫ η in terms of the same
wave function at small momenta q ∼ η.

For s states we can put h~p|U|~qi = h~p|U|0i. Since large p correspond to small
r, only the interactions with the nucleus are important in the asymptotics.
Thus, putting h~p|U|~qi = − 4παZ

, we obtain

ψF (p) =

8παZψ(0)

+ O(p−6),

Due to the Kato condition (15), this expression is identical to Eq (25).
In
similar way we can ﬁnd the asymptotics of the wave function for the ground
state of helium

ΨF (p, q2) =

8παZΨP F (0, q2)
p4

+ O(p−6).

with the partial Fourier transform ΨP F deﬁned by Eq.(45).

As to the wave function of the outgoing electron, the ﬁrst iteration of the
LSE provides the same result, as Eq.(26) of quantum mechanics (adding an
imaginary infrared divergent term, which will be absorbed into the phase fac-
tor, mentioned in the Introduction). Thus, calculating the double photoion-
ization amplitude in the length form, we immediately ﬁnd the cancellation,
expressed by Eq.(48). Hence, in the LSE technique one would not obtain the
spurious ω−5/2 term in the asymptotics of the double photoionization cross
section, even being not aware of the Kato conditions.

4 Shape of the double photoionization

spectrum: U or W ?

4.1 Mechanisms of the process

The progress of the experimental facilities in early 90-th made possible the
measurements of the energy distributions of the double photoionization of he-

16

lium. The low energy measurements have been carried out. The results for the
high energy are expected soon. This stimulated the theoretical investigations.

Evaluation of the shape of the spectrum curve have been obtained in [25].
The energy distribution dσ2+/dε reaches its largest values at the edge of the
spectrum, where ε2 ∼ I ≪ ω or ε1 ∼ I ≪ ω. The shake-oﬀ mechanism is
dominative here [20]. Large momentum Q ≫ η is exchanged between the nu-
cleus and the fast electron. Considering the larger values ε1,2 ≫ I, we need
both electrons to carry large momenta pi ≫ η. If the energies of the outgoing
electrons are not too close, the process can be viewed as the single photoion-
ization, followed by the electron scattering [26, 27]. This ﬁnal state scattering
(FSS) mechanism dominates until we do not reach the very vicinity of the
center of the spectrum, where the quasifree (QF) process becomes possible.

To understand the point, recall that each act of the exchange by a large
momentum leads to a small factor in the amplitude. The FSS mechanism
requires the exchange by two large momenta. However in the vicinity of the
center we can manage by a single large momentum exchange. The electron,
which interacts with the photon directly, can exchange large momentum with
the second electron without participation of the nucleus. Unlike the single
photoionization, the process can go on with the free electrons. The Bethe
surface is determined by the condition ~Q = 0, i.e.

which requires

~p1 + ~p2 = ~k ,

δ =

≪ 1 .

(55)

(56)

( Recall, that we do not consider very large values of the photon energies
ω ∼ m, which require the relativistic treatment of the outgoing electrons.) In
other words, the free kinematics becomes possible in the vicinity of the center
of the spectrum.

Following the general ideas, presented in the Introduction, we expect the
surplus of the spectrum curve near it’s central point due to the described QF
mechanism. The energy distribution is dominated by small values Q ∼ η of
the momentum, transferred to the nucleus.

To calculate the asymptotics, we can neglect the terms of the order Q/pi
in the wave function of the outgoing electrons. The QF amplitude can be
presented as

FQF (~p1, ~p2) = FQF (~p, ~Q) = D(Q2)Ff r(ω, δ)

(57)

17

with ~p = (~p1 −~p2)/2. The factor D(Q2) contains all the properties of the initial
state. Its explicit form will be given below — Eq. (71). The amplitude Ff r of
the absorption of the photon by two free electrons at rest can be presented as

Ff r(ω, δ) = (~e~p1)f (ω, δ) + (~e~p2)f (ω, −δ) ,

(58)

since the electron system is a space-symmetric state. We do not need to clarify
the form of the function f (ω, δ) here. Anyway, since δ ≪ 1, the lowest order
of expansion in powers of δ gives

Ff r(ω, 0) = (~e, ~p1 + ~p2)f (ω, 0) = (~e~k)f (ω, 0) = 0,

(59)

with the lowest order nonvanishing term being

Ff r(ω, δ) = 2(~e~p)δf ′(ω, 0) .

(60)

Here f ′ denotes the derivative with respect to δ.

The energy distribution in the vicinity of the center is the interplay of FSS
and QF mechanisms. Their contributions change with the photon energy in
diﬀerent ways. At ω ≪ 2keV the FSS dominates, providing U shaped curve.
At ω ≈ 2keV the QF mechanism becomes more important. The curve obtains
W shape.

Note that usually the photoionization calculations are carried out in the
lowest order of expansion in powers of krc with rc being the characteristic
value of the distances, which are important in the process. This is known as
the dipole approximation. In the nonrelativistic photoionization rc ∼ p−1 ∼
(mω)−1/2 and the dipole approximation corresponds to the lowest order of
expansion in powers of k/p ∼ (ω/m)1/2. Going beyond the dipole approxima-
tion have been something unusual, at least until the recent time. The dipole
approximation QF amplitude turns to zero due to Eq. (59). This happens
because the two-electron system cannot carry the orbital momentum, equal
to unity, in this kinematics. One should go beyond the dipole approximation
to obtain the nonvanishing QF amplitude. Unfortunately, this point was not
emphasized strongly enough neither in [25], nor in a more detailed paper [27].
The QF amplitude is expressed by Eqs. (57) and (60) with

4.2 Dipole approximation calculations

Meanwhile, several calculations of the high energy photoionization spectrum
have been reported. They were based on the straightforward computation
of the amplitude in the dipole approximation. The results appeared to be
controversial. In [28] the spectrum curve had U shaped form if the ﬁnal state
interactions (FSI) between the outgoing electrons were neglected. Account of
the FSI provided W shaped curve. The authors of [29] faced the opposite
situation. Their spectrum curve for ω = 2.8keV had W shape with a very ﬂat
peak, when FSI have been neglected. The computations with FSI included
provided U-shaped spectrum. Another series of calculations without FSI [30,
31] gave a peak in the center of the energy distribution.

4.3 Explanation of the dipole approximation

results

To understand what happened [32, 33], present the ground state wave function
in variables ~R = (~r1 + ~r2)/2 and ~ρ = ~r1 − ~r2, introducing ˜Ψ( ~R, ~ρ) = Ψ(~r1, ~r2).
Describing the outgoing electrons by the plane waves, we ﬁnd for the amplitude

F (0) = (4πα)1/2

d3Rd3ρei( ~Q ~R)−i(~p−~k,~ρ)γ ˜Ψ( ~R, ~ρ).

(62)

Z

Following the analysis, carried out in Sec.3, we expect the asymptotics F (0)(p, Q) ∼
1/(p4Q4) at p, Q ≫ η. However, in the vicinity of the center of the energy dis-
tribution we can make Q ∼ η. These values of Q will be dominative in the
energy distribution. The calculation, similar to the one, presented by Eq. (25)
provides

at p ≫ η, Q ∼ η, with ∂ ˜Ψ(R, ρ = 0)/∂ρ denoting the partial derivation of the
function ˜Ψ(R, ρ) with respect to ρ at ρ = 0. The energy dependence of the
amplitude F (0) is determined by the factor p−4, caused by the large momentum
exchange.

(63)

Large momentum can be exchanged by the outgoing electrons as well. The
lowest order perturbative correction ψ(1) to the ﬁnal state wave function can
be obtained by using the standard formula (26) with V C being replaced by

19

the interaction between the electrons. The corresponding amplitude F (1) is
of the same order of magnitude as F (0), containing the same factor p−4. The
situation is similar to that with the shake-oﬀ amplitude in the length form,
which was discussed above. The correction ψ(1)(ρ) to the wave function of
the outgoing electrons is ξ times smaller than the free wave function ψ(0)(ρ)
in each space point ρ. However, the functions ψ(0) and ψ(1) contribute to the
amplitude in diﬀerent space regions. While the amplitude F (0) is determined
by small distances ρ ∼ p−1, the amplitude F (1) is dominated by the values of ρ
of the order of the size of the atom ∼ η−1. In both cases R ∼ Q−1 ∼ η−1, and
both electrons are separated from the nucleus by the distances of the order of
the size of the atom.

at p ≫ η, Q ∼ η. Each of the amplitudes F (0,1), treated separately, provide
the contribution, which exceeds strongly the amplitude, describing the FSI
mechanism and requiring Q ≫ η. Hence, each of the terms F (0,1), treated
separately, would lead to a surplus in the energy distribution in the central
region. However

since the last factor in the integrand turns to zero for all values of R due to
Eq. (12). In the dipole approximation the leading contribution to the energy
distribution is determined by Q ≫ η, providing the U-shaped spectrum curve.
However, the true distribution can be obtained only by going beyond the dipole
approximation.

Now we can explain the results of [28]–[31]. The authors of [28] used the
ground state wave function with a weak dependence on ρ. It was too weak to
provide a maximum, when neglecting FSI. Inclusion of FSI provided a spurious
uncompensated W peak. In contrast, authors of [29] used wave functions which
satisﬁed the Kato condition (12). Thus they obtained U shape, when taking
into account the FSI. This corresponds to Eq. (65). However, a spurious W
peak emerged when the FSI were neglected. The spurious central surplus,

20

obtained in [30, 31] in dipole approximation with FSI being neglected have the
same origin.

The Lippman-Schwinger equation (LSE), presented by Eq. (49) enables to
obtain these results in a simple way. The amplitude F (0) can be expressed in
terms of asymptotics of the Fourier transformed wave function
F (0) = −(4πα)1/2 (~e ~Q)

˜ΨF (− ~Q, ~p) ,

(66)

at Q ∼ η, p ≫ η. The integral in the rhs is saturated by q ∼ η. Hence, the LSE
presented the function ˜ΨF (Q ∼ η, p ≫ η) in terms of this function at Q ∼ η,
q ∼ η. Using Eqs.
(64) and (67) we immediately obtain the cancellation
F (0) + F (1) = 0, without employing the Kato condition (12).

Note that the interactions between the outgoing electrons appeared to be
more important than their interactions with the nucleus. The latter provide
only additional corrections, while the former determine a possible mechanism
of the process. Similar analysis with the Coulomb functions for the continuum
electrons as a starting point is given in [32].

4.4 Necessary properties of the approximate

functions

Most of the calculations of the energy spectrum are based on the original
formalism of quantum mechanics. This means straightforward employing of
the equation

with the amplitude F calculated as

by the direct calculation of the integral. One should inevitably use approximate
wave functions ψf a and ψa for the description of the ﬁnal and initial states.

ψa(~r1, ~r2)

(69)

(cid:17)

Z

21

To reproduce essential physics, the approximate wave functions should posses
certain properties of the true wave functions.

As we have seen in Sec. 3, in the region of the shake-oﬀ domination ε1 ≈ ω,
ε2 ∼ I, the FSI correlations are not important and one can approximate the
ﬁnal state by the product of the single-particle functions, putting ψf a(~r1, ~r2) =
ψap1(r1)ψap2(r2) and employing the Coulomb ﬁeld function for ψap2.
In the
velocity form of the operator γ one can use the plane wave for the description
of the fast electron [20]. Description of the initial state by the product of the
single-particle wave functions

ψa(~r1, ~r2) = ψs(r1)ψs(r2)

(70)

leads to the quantitatively wrong results. Thus the initial state correlations
beyond eﬀective ﬁeld approximation are important [22]. However, there is no
formula, which would enable to select ”good” wave functions. One should be
even more careful, employing the length form of the operator γ. The lowest
order Coulomb correction to the wave function of the fast outgoing electron
should be included and Eq. (11) should be fulﬁlled for the initial state function
ψa(~r1, ~r2) [24].

Turning to the part of the spectrum with ε1,2 ≫ I we see that the lowest
order ﬁnal state interactions should be included in the wave function ψf a. This
is suﬃcient for the proper description of all the region of FSS domination.
However, to describe the region of QF mechanism domination, one needs the
wave function ψa, for which the Kato condition (12) is true. Otherwise the
spectrum curve obtains a spurious W peak in the dipole approximation (the
latter corresponds to replacement ei(kr1,2) by unity in Eq. (69)).

As we saw earlier, the true W peak can be obtained beyond the dipole
approximation. This is equivalent to evaluation of the rhs of Eq. (69), by
including the second terms of the expansion of the exponential factors ei(~k~rj ) =
1 + i(~k~rj) + . . . . Such approach provides Eq. (57) for the QF amplitude with
Ff r(ω, δ) deﬁned by Eq. (60) and

D(Q2) = 2r0

Z

(71)

The proper value of the derivative ∂ ˜ψa(R,ρ=0)
can be insured by the Kato con-
∂ρ
dition (12). Thus, even taking care of separating the quadrupole terms, one
needs the approximate function ˜ψa, satisfying the Kato condition (12) for the

22

proper description of the QF central peak. Of course, any approximate func-
tion with a nonzero value of ∂ ˜ψa(R,ρ=0)
provides a central peak describing the
QF mechanism qualitatively. However, the quantitative results can be trusted
only if Eq.(12) is satisﬁed. Considering such approximate function, which can
be presented as combinations of the single-particle functions (70), we ﬁnd the
corresponding

to be the even function of ρ. Thus, the computations, carried out in the
quadrupole approximation would show no trace of the QF contribution. The
Hartree-Fock functions provide one of examples.

enables to diminish the number of phenomenological parameters. It helps to
avoid ”submarine rocks” in the calculations of the asymptotics of the double
photoionization cross section.
It enables also to ﬁnd the true shape of the
double photoionization spectrum curve.

It was shown also that the Lippman-Schwinger equation is a powerful tool
for investigation of the asymptotics. Unfortunately, the LSE and the Feynman
diagram technique, which can be viewed as its visual illustration, did not yet
become a part of everyday life it atomic theory studies.

In 1959 Ya. B. Zel'dovih predited that the bound-state spetrum of the non-relativisti Coulomb

problem distorted at small distanes by a short-range potential undergoes a peuliar reonstrution

whenever this potential alone supports a low-energy sattering resonane. However doumented

experimental evidene of this e(cid:27)et has been laking. Previous theoretial studies of this phe-

nomenon were on(cid:28)ned to the regime where the range of the short-ranged potential is muh smaller

than Bohr's radius of the Coulomb (cid:28)eld. We go beyond this limitation by restriting ourselves to

highly-exited s states. This allows us to demonstrate that along the Periodi Table of elements

the Zel'dovih e(cid:27)et manifests itself as systemati periodi variation of the Rydberg spetra with a

period proportional to the ubi root of the atomi number. This dependene, whih is supported

by analysis of experimental and numerial data, has its origin in the binding properties of the ioni

ore of the atom.

a entral short-ranged potential. An important aspet of

this problem is the existene of two length sales - the

Bohr radius of the Coulomb (cid:28)eld aB and the range of
ation of short-range fores r0 .

For example, in hadroni atoms formed by harged par-

tration gives its way at short distanes to nulear fores

whose range r0 is signi(cid:28)antly smaller than aB [1℄.

slope of the µ(w) dependene will be minimal when the

Fano, Theodosiou and Dehmer [12℄. Upon further in-

To summarize, as as(w) goes through one omplete

it is mostly zero or unity exept for

As the oupling onstant w ontinues to inrease away
from as(w) = 0, the next yle, 1 < µ(w) < 2, begins and

an inreasing funtion of w having the form of a stairase

where δs(k) is the phase shift. Employing Seaton's theo-
rem [9℄ δ = πµ relating the quantum defet to the zero-

with pratially integer plateaus and sharp steps loated

at half-integer µ. The steps orrespond to the presene
of the low-energy sattering resonanes in Us(r).

To illustrate this behavior we hoose the inner poten-

of the funtion χ in Eq.(1) oinides with the boundary
of the entral region, as = r0 .

Finally we note that the quantum defet takes on ex-

atly integer values whenever the sattering length van-

B. Connetion to Levinson's theorem

There is a deep parallel between the Zel'dovih reon-

strution of the upper E

aB limit and the low-energy sattering

tude, kr0

be de(cid:28)ned [20℄ through the k

≪

aB → ∞, when the Coulomb part of the binding poten-
tial U (r) in (1) vanishes. From this viewpoint, Levinson's

theorem is a onsequene of the Zel'dovih e(cid:27)et. To em-

phasize the onnetion to Levinson's theorem, in Fig. 3

we additionally show the zero-energy phase shift δ = πµ.
Fig. 3 also demonstrates that as x0 inreases, the
stairase µ(ζ) dependene with well-de(cid:28)ned steps and

plateaus evolves into an inreasing funtion with mod-

ulations: the (cid:16)plateaus(cid:17) develop notieable slope and the

(cid:16)steps(cid:17) aquire a width. Moreover for su(cid:30)iently large

x0 & 1 the stairase-like appearane seems to emerge
large ζ . Another

only for a su(cid:30)iently deep well, i. e.

feature is the presene of a negative o(cid:27)set whih is a

growing funtion of x0 . This is due to the fat that for
Us(r) = 0 the quantum defet is a monotonially dereas-
ing negative funtion of x0 as shown in Fig. 1.

For most realisti models of the inner potential Us(r)

the exat analytial alulation of the sattering length

Eq.(11) may not be possible. Therefore it is pertinent to

treatment apturing the Zel'dovih spetrum reonstru-

For x0

lassial result for the quantum defet Eq.(22) shown in

Fig. 6 is aurate; only qualitative agreement is expeted

(28)

for lightest elements.

C. Beyond semilassial approximation: onnetion

to binding properties of ioni ore

A more aurate µ(Z 1/3) dependene an be found

by omputing the sattering length (23) and substitut-

ing the outome together with the x0(Z 1/3) dependene,

ially solving the Thomas-Fermi equation (26), inverting

Fig. 6, in our general expression for the quantum defet

(27), and omputing the integral (28). The results are

(11). The result is shown in Fig. 7 where we also plot the

displayed in Fig. 6 where we show x0/π and S0/π~ as
funtions of Z 1/3

. These funtions are used to also plot

semilassial quantum defet, µsc , Eq.(22) (gray sale).
It now beomes obvious that for any Z the bulk ontribu-

the semilassial quantum defet given by Eq.(22). To as-

tion into the quantum defet is well-aptured semilassi-

sess the auray of the resulting µsc(Z 1/3) dependene

ally. The Zel'dovih spetral modulation learly visible

we need to verify whether approximations used to derive

in Fig. 7 is a relatively weak e(cid:27)et. To separate the mod-

Eq.(22) are adequate. The (cid:28)rst assumption, x0

1, is

equivalent to the assertion that the quantum defet for

Us(r) = 0 an be replaed by its large x0 limit. Looking

≫

ulation from the monotoni s semilassial bakground

the inset shows the di(cid:27)erene δµ = µ
pears to be a nearly periodi funtion of Z 1/3

−

µsc whih ap-

. To better

at Fig. 1 where the dependenes in question are ompared

understand the meaning of this periodiity the inset also

we onlude that (cid:16)large(cid:17) here really means x0 & π . The
seond, semilassial assumption S0/~
1 in pratie
has a good auray provided S0/π~, the number of de
Broglie's half-waves (cid:28)tting into the inner potential Us(r),

≫

see that the onditions x0/π & 1 and S0/π~ & 2 are
satis(cid:28)ed for Z & 8. This is also the pratial ondition

shows the limiting expression (24) (gray sale) [25℄. Both

urves are exatly in phase and for su(cid:30)iently heavy el-

ements their magnitudes agree semi-quantitatively. This

observation implies that the Zel'dovih modulation is a

(cid:28)tting inside the ioni ore of the atom.

A omplementary way to see the onnetion between

Let us additionally assume that the inner potential

so that a semilassial treatment is valid. The orre-

systemati result due to di(cid:27)erent values of the range pa-

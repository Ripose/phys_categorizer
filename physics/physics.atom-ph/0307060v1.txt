Abstract

Electric polarizabilities of four low-J even-parity states and three low-J odd-parity states of

atomic barium in the range 35, 600 to 36, 000 cm−1 are investigated. The states of interest are

excited (in an atomic beam) via an intermediate odd-parity state with a sequence of two laser

pulses. The odd-parity states can be excited due to the Stark-induced mixing with even-parity

states. The polarizabilities are measured via direct spectroscopy on the second-stage transition.

Several states have tensor and scalar polarizabilities that exceed the values that might be expected

from the known energy levels of barium by more than two orders of magnitude. Two of the

Stark-induced transitions cannot be identiﬁed from the known energy spectrum of barium. The

observations suggest the existence of as yet unidentiﬁed odd-parity energy states, whose energies

and angular momenta are determined in the present experiment. A tentative identiﬁcation of these

INTRODUCTION

Polarizabilities describe how the energy levels of a system, such as an atom, shift in

an external electric ﬁeld. They provide a way to probe the atomic wave function at large

distances from the nucleus, and are related to various physical quantities, including van

der Waals constants, dielectric constants, indices of refraction, and charge-exchange cross

sections.

In this work, we measured the polarizabilities of seven energy levels of barium

lying between 35, 600 and 36, 000 cm−1. Although polarizabilities of several levels of barium

have been measured [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], those of many other states are not yet determined. Our

primary motivation for this work is obtaining information that will be used in the analysis

of sensitivity and possible systematic uncertainties in experiments searching for violation of

Bose-Einstein statistics for photons [6].

In the ﬁrst part of this work, we measured the scalar and tensor polarizabilities and,

in some cases, hyperpolarizabilities of four even-parity states, 6p2 3P2, 6s7d 3D1,2, and
5d6d 3D1, of barium (Fig. 1). We found that three out of these four states have extremely

large polarizabilities that could only be explained by the existence of as-yet-unidentiﬁed

closely-lying states of odd parity.

In the second part of the work, we looked for Stark-induced transitions to the odd-parity

states in the range 35, 600 to 36, 000 cm −1. Several Stark-induced resonances were found and

classiﬁed into three sets, corresponding to transitions to electric-ﬁeld-split Zeeman sublevels

of three odd-parity states. One of these can be identiﬁed as the 6s8p 3P1 state. The other two
cannot be identiﬁed with the known energy levels of barium and are possibly the 6s8p 3P0,2

states, which are predicted to exist, but have not been found. Their energies are determined

to be 35, 648.5(1) cm−1 and 35, 757(1) cm−1 respectively. The existence of these states at

these energies gives a plausible explanation for the unusually large polarizabilities found in

the ﬁrst part of the experiment. The polarizabilities of two odd-parity states have also been

determined and are reported here.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Pulsed lasers are used to excite barium atoms in an atomic beam to the even-parity

states of interest via two successive E1 transitions (Fig. 2). Fluorescence resulting from

3

spontaneous decay to a lower-lying state is observed with a photomultiplier tube (PMT).

When an electric ﬁeld is applied to the interaction region, the resonance signal is Stark-

shifted and split (Fig. 3). In addition, Stark-induced transitions to neighboring odd-parity

states are seen; these are also shifted and split by the electric ﬁeld. The scalar and tensor

polarizabilities can be derived from appropriate ﬁtting functions relating the positions of

the resolved resonance peaks and the applied electric ﬁeld.

The apparatus used (Fig. 4) is largely the same as in a previous experiment [7]. The

barium beam is produced with an eﬀusion source with a multi-slit nozzle that collimates

the angular spread of the beam to

0.1 rad in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

The oven, heat-shielded with tantalum foil, is resistively heated to

700◦C, corresponding

≈

to saturated barium pressure in the oven of

≈

gas pressure in the vacuum chamber is

10−5 Torr.

≈
20 cm away from the nozzle, of

0.1 Torr and estimated atomic beam density

The electric ﬁeld is supplied by two plane-parallel electrodes (angle

10−3 rad) with

≤

diameter 6.4 cm, spaced 0.9153(3) cm apart. Voltage of up to 80 kV is applied to the top

electrode using a high-voltage feed-through whose design is described in detail in Ref. [7].

The laser systems in the experiment are two tunable dye lasers (Quanta Ray PDL-2)

pumped by pulsed frequency-doubled Nd-YAG lasers (Quanta Ray DCR-11 and Quantel

YAG580). The Quantel laser operates at a repetition rate of

10 Hz, and slaves the Quanta

≈

Ray YAG laser, so the relative timing of the two

10-ns laser output pulses can be controlled

to within

1 ns. In order to avoid shifts of the second-stage transition spectra due to the

≈

dynamic Stark eﬀect, the relative timing of the two laser pulses is oﬀset by

25 ns. The

≈

dyes used are Fluorescein 548 and Rhodamine 6G. For the dye laser with Fluorescein 548,
the wavelength is set at 554.7 nm (on resonance with the 6s2 1S0 →

ﬁeld. The typical pulse energy is

≈

1.5 mJ. For the dye laser with Rhodamine 6G, the

wavelength is coarsely tuned from 556 nm to 570 nm by tilting the diﬀraction grating in the

laser cavity, and ﬁnely tuned in a range of

0.2 nm near a given resonance by varying the

gas (N2) pressure in the laser-oscillator-cavity chamber. The laser line width is

20 GHz,

≈

or

6 GHz when a narrowing etalon is employed. Typical pulse energy is 3 mJ. Color glass

≈

ﬁlters are used to reduce the pulse energy to

0.4 mJ to avoid power broadening eﬀects.

Both laser beams are

3 mm in diameter.

≈

≈

≈

The two laser beams are sent into the chamber in anti-parallel directions. To block

scattered light from entering the chamber, two 38-cm-long collimating arms with several

knife-edge diaphragms are used for the entrance and exit of the laser beams.

Fluorescence is detected at 45◦ to both the atomic and laser beams with a 2-in.-diameter

PMT (type EMI 9750B). The gain of the PMT is

105 and the quantum eﬃciency at

7

≈

×

the wavelengths used is

25%. Interference ﬁlters with 10-nm bandwidth are used to select

≈

the decay channel of interest, and a color glass ﬁlter is used to further reduce the scattered

light from the lasers.

In the ﬁrst part of this experiment, we used CAMAC modules connected through a general

purpose interface bus (GPIB) to a personal computer running LABVIEW software for data

acquisition. The ﬂuorescence signal, as well as laser diagnostics, including frequency markers,

are recorded. In the second part, we observed the time-dependent ﬂuorescence signals with

a digital oscilloscope and determined the resonance wavelengths of the second-stage laser

from the reading of the grating position.

In the experiment, we scan the frequency of the second-stage laser across the resonance of

a certain state with total angular momentum J. When no electric ﬁeld is applied, we expect

to see one resonance peak (or nothing in the case of Stark-induced transitions). The shape of

the peak is mostly determined by the laser spectrum averaged over many pulses and can be

approximated with a Lorentzian. When the electric ﬁeld is applied along the quantization

(z) axis we expect the resonance to shift and split into J + 1 peaks (for the present case of

integer J), corresponding to sublevels with diﬀerent

M

. To tell the

corresponds to, we vary the polarizations of both laser beams, observe the variations of the

resonant signal amplitudes and compare them to our expectations summarized in Table I.

III. THEORY OF POLARIZABILITY

In this section, we brieﬂy introduce some deﬁnitions and formulae used in this work. For

a detailed discussion, see Refs. [3, 8].

For example, a small portion of a nominally odd-parity state has even parity. The mixing

(18)

amplitude is proportional to the applied electric ﬁeld. Therefore, a nominally odd-parity

state can be excited from the ground state via two E1 transitions when the electric ﬁeld is

applied. The transition probability to this state, which is proportional to the square of the

mixing amplitude, is quadratically dependent on the applied electric ﬁeld. In the experi-

ment, we detect the Stark-induced signal from the decay of the even-parity component of the

nominally odd-parity state to 6s8p 3P1, which makes the emission probability also quadrat-

ically dependent on the electric ﬁeld. Therefore, for weak electric ﬁelds, the amplitude of

the signal scales as the fourth power of the ﬁeld. On the other hand, if the electric ﬁeld is

so strong that the states of opposite parity are fully mixed, the signal amplitude is almost

independent of the applied electric ﬁeld. Thus, the dependence of the signal amplitude on

the applied electric ﬁeld can be used to check the validity of the perturbation approximation.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This section is divided into two subsections. In the ﬁrst part, we discuss the Stark eﬀect

in four even-parity states in the range 35, 600 to 36, 000 cm−1. The polarizabilities of three

of these states are too large to be explained by the known energy spectrum of barium and

imply the existence of “new” states. As shown in Fig. 1, within the energy range probed

in this experiment, one may expect the J = 0 and J = 2 of 6s8p 3PJ states that have not

8

been identiﬁed before are candidates for these new states. In the second part, we discuss the

observation of the Stark-induced transitions to the odd-parity states. Two of them cannot

be identiﬁed with the known energy levels of barium. They are possibly the 6s8p 3P0,2

states and their energies are determined in this experiment. With the existence of these

two “new” states, the unusually large polarizabilities found in the ﬁrst subsection can be

plausibly explained.

The measured relative energy shifts include the Stark-induced shift of the intermediate

state, 6s6p 1P1. However, the scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the 6s6p 1P1 state are
5.34(5) kHz/(kV/cm)2 [9], respectively, and contribute to the
51(3) kHz/(kV/cm)2 and

shift at a level

200 MHz, negligible compared to the observed shifts.

A. Stark eﬀect of even-parity states

The derived scalar and tensor polarizabilities of 6p2 3P2, 6s7d 3D1,2 and 5d6d 3D1 states

are listed in Table II. Multiple resonance peaks are observed for each of these four states

corresponding to diﬀerent values of

M

. Moreover, the Stark shifts of two states show signif-

|

|

icant deviation from quadratic behavior as a function of the electric ﬁeld, so that the scalar

and tensor hyperpolarizabilities can be measured (Table III). The detailed experimental

results for these four states are discussed in the following.

a. The 6p2 3P2 state. With an electric ﬁeld applied, three resonance peaks are observed

for this state (Figs. 3, 5). We locate the centers of the peaks by ﬁtting the data with

Lorentzian functions. The peaks are put into correspondence with Zeeman sublevels using

Eq. (13) and their amplitude dependence on laser polarization. Although the observed level

shifts are dominated by the polarizability, we are also able to resolve the hyperpolarizability

of each sublevel by ﬁtting with Eq. (14).

The closest known state that can Stark-mix with the 6p2 3P2 M = 0 sublevel

is

6s8p 3P1 [10], with ∆E =

52.0(2) cm−1 (Fig. 1).

If we assume that this is the domi-

−

nantly coupled state, from the shift of the M = 0 sublevel, we ﬁnd for the reduced electric

dipole moment:

(6p2 3P2k

|

D

6s8p 3P1)two−level|

k

= 14.7(2) ea0 (Table IV). This is far too

large, considering that the electronic conﬁgurations of these two states are diﬀerent by two

electrons. Thus we can conclude that the coupling to other states and/or the eﬀects of

conﬁguration mixing are not negligible.

The closest known state that can couple to the 6p2 3P2 |

M

|

= 1 sublevels is again

6s8p 3P1. Using the two-level approximation, we ﬁnd that the reduced electric dipole moment

is

(6p2 3P2k

|

D

6s8p 3P1)two−level|

k

= 14.3(2) ea0, which is again too large. However, the fact

that the obtained reduced electric dipole moments derived from M = 0 and

M

= 1 sub-

levels are nearly the same may suggest that the 6p2 3P2 state and the 6s8p 3P1 state indeed

have large electric dipole coupling perhaps due to admixtures of other conﬁgurations.

There is no apparent dominant close energy state that can couple to the

M

= 2 sublevels.

This explains the fact that the shift of the

M

= 2 sublevels is an order of magnitude smaller

|

|

|

|

than that of

M

|

|

|
= 1 and M = 0 sublevels.

|

b. The 6s7d 3D1 state. With electric ﬁeld applied, the resonance peak is split into two

peaks, corresponding to the M = 0 and

M

= 1 sublevels, respectively (Figs. 6, 7). The

size of the resonance peak corresponding to the

J = 1 M = 0

sublevel is more than one

order of magnitude smaller because in our experimental setup, the transition to this sublevel

|

|

|

i

is nominally forbidden. It is still observed most likely because of the imperfections in the

direction and purity of the laser polarizations.

Neither of the curves in Fig. 7 can be adequately ﬁt with quadratic functions at high

electric ﬁelds. Therefore, the next (fourth) order terms in the perturbation expansion should

be included in the ﬁtting function and both polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities can be

determined.

If there is a dominantly coupled state for each of the

M

sublevels, the Stark energy

|

|

shifts can be described by the exact solution of the two-level Hamiltonian, Eq. (3). Under

this two-level approximation, the energy diﬀerence and the electric dipole couplings between

the

M

sublevels and their dominant coupling state can be determined separately, and the

|

|

polarizabilities can be obtained from Eq. (5).
The large polarizability of the 6s7d 3D1 |

|

M

= 1 sub-levels might have been plausibly

explained by the coupling with the close 6s8p 3P1 state. However, under the two-level
7 cm−1, which is about ﬁve times smaller than the

approximation, we obtain ∆E

|two−level ≈

actual energy diﬀerence of 6s7d 3D1 and 6s8p 3P1 states [10]. This shows that the two-level

approximation breaks down and the mixing with other states is not negligible.

The large polarizability of 6s7d 3D1 M = 0 sublevel cannot be explained by the known

odd-parity energy levels. Using the two-level approximation, one odd-parity state with

J = 0 or J = 2 is predicted to be at

35, 673 cm−1. However, it is shown in Fig. 1

≈

10

that 6s8p 3P1 is the only odd-parity state known with that energy. As will be discussed

in the next subsection, no unidentiﬁed “new” state is expected there either. This shows

that two-level approximation is not applicable. Nevertheless, there should be at least one

J = 0 or J = 2 odd-parity state lying somewhat below 35, 709 cm−1, the energy of 6s7d 3D1

state, in order to explain the large negative polarizability of this sublevel. This prediction

is conﬁrmed in the next subsection.

c. The 5d6d 3D1 state. With the electric ﬁeld applied, the resonance peak of the

5d6d 3D1 state is split into two peaks, corresponding to

M

= 1 and M = 0 sublevels

|

|

(Fig. 8). The amplitude of the resonance peak of M = 0 sublevel is, as expected, much

smaller than that of the

M

= 1 sublevels. For both curves in Fig. 8, quadratic functions

|

|

are used in the ﬁtting to determine polarizabilities. The polarizabilities of this state are at

least one order of magnitude smaller than others and agree with our estimate based on the

known energy levels of barium.

d. The 6s7d 3D2 state. The plot of the Stark-induced energy shift of the 6s7d 3D2

state as a function of the applied electric ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 9. For the M = 0 sublevel,

a quadratic function is not adequate to ﬁt the data points and the fourth order term is

included in the ﬁtting function. With Eq. (15), we determined the polarizability α(M =

0) =

66.6(5) MHz/(kV/cm)2 and hyperpolarizability γ(M = 0) = 8(2) kHz/(kV/cm)4.

−

The 6s7d 3D2 M = 0 sublevel can be expected to dominantly couple to the 6s8p 3P1
M = 0. The coupling to 6s8p 1P1 is suppressed because of the diﬀerence in total spins1.
|two−level = 103(20) cm−1 is consistent
with the energy diﬀerence between those two states, 93.2(2) cm−1. The derived reduced

this new state; otherwise the two-level approximation would not apply for M = 0 sublevel.

is known that the electric dipole moment between two states with ∆J =

is the orbital angular momentum, is suppressed [8] (See also Table V). Therefore, on the

basis of all these arguments, this new state is predicted to be a 3P2 state. This prediction is

conﬁrmed by the observation of one of the Stark-induced transitions discussed in the next

subsection. The missing state is most likely 6s8p 3P2.

B. Observation of the Stark-induced transitions

In this subsection, we discuss the observation of the Stark-induced transitions to the odd-

parity states. Within the energy range studied, ﬁve Stark-induced transitions are detected

and classiﬁed into three sets. Each set of resonances is discussed in detail in the following.

Two of the Stark-induced resonances are classiﬁed as the ﬁrst set. According to the

electric-ﬁeld dependence of the amplitudes of the signals, the perturbation theory applies

in both cases. The resonance position as a function of the applied electric ﬁeld is shown in

12

Fig. 10. The ﬁtting function for

M

= 1 sublevels is a quadratic function plus a constant

|

|

term, which corresponds to the energy of the zero-electric-ﬁeld resonance, which cannot be

measured directly in our experiment. For the M = 0 sublevel, the fourth order term is nec-

essary and Eq. (14) plus a constant is employed as the ﬁtting function. The derived energies

of the zero-electric-ﬁeld resonance from each curve are 35, 668.7(2) and 35, 668.8(2) cm−1,

respectively. The coincidence of the two values shows that they are the split Zeeman sub-

levels of the same state. The fact that this derived energy coincides with the energy of

the 6s8p 3P1 state, 35, 669.0(2) cm−1 [10], indicates that these two resonance peaks are the

Stark-induced transitions to the

M

= 1 and M = 0 sublevels of this state. The

M

of each

|

|

|

|

curve is determined from the amplitude dependence on laser polarization. From the electric-

ﬁeld dependence of the resonance position, we have determined the polarizabilities of the

6s8p 3P1 state (Table II) and the hyperpolarizability γ(M = 0) =

47(11) kHz/(kV/cm)4.

−

One of the Stark-induced resonances is classiﬁed as belonging to a set by itself. Accord-

ing to the electric-ﬁeld dependence of the amplitude of the signal, the perturbation theory

applies in this case. The resonance position as a function of the applied electric ﬁeld is

shown in Fig. 11. The data points are ﬁt with Eq. (14) plus a constant term. The polar-

izability can be derived and the position of the zero-electric-ﬁeld resonance is determined

at 35, 648.5(1) cm−1. As shown in Fig. 1, no state has been previously identiﬁed with this

energy. The variation of the amplitude of the signal as a function of the polarizations of the

laser beams is consistent with that of a M = 0 sublevel. This “new” odd-parity state is prob-

ably the missing 6s8p 3P0 state. The existence of this state explains the large polarizabilities
of the 6s7d 3D1 state.

The other two of the Stark-induced resonances are classiﬁed as the third set. We have

identiﬁed them (using the laser-polarization dependence of the signal amplitude) as due to

the

M

= 1 and

M

= 2 sublevels, respectively. From the electric-ﬁeld dependence of the

|

|

|

|

amplitudes of the signals, the perturbation theory is not applicable in either case. This

is consistent with that the Stark-induced energy shifts are almost linearly dependent on

the applied electric ﬁeld (Fig. 12). The data show that the zero-ﬁeld-energy of a J

odd-parity state should be within 35, 756, derived from polynomial ﬁt, and 35, 761 cm−1,

derived from linear ﬁt. This is consistent with the predicted energy of the 6s8p 3P2 state
(35, 756(1) cm−1) from the Stark-eﬀect of the 6s7d 3D2 |
level approximation. Therefore, these two Stark-induced resonances are probably due to the

state is determined at 35, 757(1) cm−1. The M = 0 sublevel is missing because, unlike the

because of the lack of the low-ﬁeld data. However, the lower bounds of the scalar and tensor

polarizabilities can be determined (Table II).

V. DATA ANALYSIS

In subsection A, we estimate the mixing of states according to the known energy spectrum,

including the newly found states. In subsection B, we derive the electric dipole moments

from the measured polarizabilities in Table II.

A. Conﬁguration and spin-orbit mixing

There are two multiplets, 6s7d 3DJ and 6s8p 3PJ , in the energy interval under discussion.

Both present some irregularities in the ﬁne-structure splittings. We can use them to estimate

the mixing with the nearby levels.

The ratio of the “unperturbed” intervals for the 6s7d 3DJ multiplet should be (EJ=3 −
EJ=2)/(EJ=2 −
EJ=1) = 3/2, according to the Lande interval rule [8]. The most probable
explanation for the deviation from this rule is the repulsion between the 6s7d 3D2 and
6p2 3P2
2. Assuming that 6p2 3P2 is the only perturbing source of this multiplet, we have a

simpliﬁed hamiltonian for these two states:

In this case, the mixing is smaller and the mixing angle χ

arctan(0.27). For both multi-

≈

plets, because of the non-negligible mixing angles, the mixing should be taken into account

in the analysis in the next subsection.

In the LS-coupling scheme, the ratios between the electric dipole moments of the 6s7d 3DJ
and 6s8p 3PJ multiplets are given in Table V [8]. Since LS coupling is not exact, we do

not expect these relations to be accurate. However, they can give us the estimates for the

contributions of the weak couplings.

B. Electric dipole moments derived from experimental data on polarizabilities

In this subsection, we try to derive electric dipole moments from the measured polariz-

abilities presented in Table II. In Table VI, the angular coeﬃcients from Eqs.(10,12) are

tabulated. It simpliﬁes the analysis if one uses combinations of α0 and α2 in order to ex-

clude contributions of particular opposite-parity states. These combinations for J = 1 and

J = 2 are given in Table VII. The dipole moments derived in this subsection are listed in

Table VIII.

15

1. The 6p2 3P2 state.

The three dominant coupling states are 6s8p 3P1,2, and 6s8p 1P1. The 5d7p 3F2 state is

negligible because energy diﬀerence is large and the conﬁguration is diﬀerent by two electrons

with ∆L = 2. Using Table VII, we can exclude the contribution from J = 1 states by taking

the following combination of the scalar and tensor polarizabilities:

2. The 6s7d 3D1 state.

The four dominant coupling states are the 6s8p 3P0,1,2, and 6s8p 1P1 states. The coupling
to the 5d7p 3F2 state is negligible because the conﬁgurations is diﬀerent by two electrons
and the energy diﬀerence is large. The coupling to the 6s8p 3P2 state is suppressed because

4. The 5d6d 3D1 state.

For this state, we can expect that the largest contribution of the polarizabilities is from

the coupling to the 5d7p 3F2 state, which is counterbalanced by four smaller couplings to the

17

closer levels. This may explain the smallness of both polarizabilities of this level. However,

the quantitative analysis is hampered by the large number of contributions. Thus, we are

not able to use experimental data for this state in our analysis.

5. The 6s8p 3P0 state.

The dominant coupling states are the 6s7d 3D1 and 5d6d 3D1 states. We can use Eq.(26)
to calculate the contribution of the 6s7d 3D1 state and estimate the coupling to the 5d6d 3D1

state.

large dipole moment probably means that the 5d6d 3D1 state interacts with the 6s7d 3D1

state. This interaction can inﬂuence the mixing angle φ, which is derived under the assump-

tion that the 6s7d 3D0,2 states are unperturbed by the conﬁguration or spin-orbit mixing.
This interaction “shifts” the 6s7d 3D2 state downwards and makes mixing angle φ larger.

6. The 6s8p 3P1 state.

The dominant coupling states for the 6s8p 3P1 state are 6p2 3P2, 6s7d 3D1, and 5d6d 3D1
states. We have derived all major contributions to the polarizabilities of the 6s8p 3P1 state.

Therefore, we can use the polarizabilities to check our model for consistency. The scalar

VI. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES

(36)

(37)

(38)

The systematic uncertainties in this work come in two ways. One is from the simpliﬁed

models used in the data analysis. The other is from the limited sensitivities of the apparatus.

It is found that the systematic uncertainties are mostly from the simpliﬁed models. To

take them into account, we multiply the statistical uncertainties by the square-root of the

reduced χ2 to be the presented uncertainties.

The possible sources of the systematic uncertainties from the limited sensitivity of the

apparatus are discussed. It is found that the dominant errors come from the drift of the

frequency markers (in the ﬁrst part of the experiment) and the uncertainty in the reading

of the grating position (in the second part of the experiment).

In the ﬁrst part of the experiment, a temporal drift of the frequency-markers was observed.

The overall drift is about 10 GHz over

4 hours of run time. The eﬀect is consistent

with what we expect from the thermal variation of the index of refraction and the thermal

expansion of the glass heated by the laser and/or variations of room temperature. To

account for the drift, we recorded zero-electric-ﬁeld scans before and after each non-zero-ﬁeld

scan. The drifts of the frequency markers relative to the positions of the zero-electric-ﬁeld

resonance peaks were thus observed and recorded. Because the drift is a smooth function of

time, knowing at what time a given scan is recorded, we can determine the reference point

∼

of the energy shifts when the electric ﬁeld is applied from the positions of the two adjacent

zero-electric-ﬁeld resonance peaks. This systematic error can be reduced to

500 MHz.

However, this is still the dominant source of the systematic uncertainties.

In the second part of the experiment, it is more diﬃcult to determine the Stark-induced

energy shift because the signal is only present when the electric ﬁeld is applied. In order to

reduce the error from the temporal drift of the reading of the grating position, we use the

same method, but instead of recording the position of a resonance at zero electric ﬁeld, we

record that of transition to 6p2 3P2, whose energy is well-determined, before and after each

measurement of the resonance of the Stark-induced transition. This method reduces the

systematic error to

6 GHz. This is the dominant source of the systematic uncertainties.

The electric ﬁeld calibration was discussed in Ref.[7]. The high voltage output is cali-

brated to 0.015%. The electrode spacing is calibrated to 0.02%. This determines the electric

ﬁeld with 0.03% precision. Therefore, the systematic uncertainty of the electric ﬁeld is neg-

ligible.

In the presence of strong laser pulses, the energy of a state is shifted, due to the dynamic

Stark eﬀect. To avoid this eﬀect, we temporally separate the two pulses by 20

30 ns and

attenuate the powers of lasers, so they barely saturate the transitions. We have veriﬁed that

the measured polarizabilities are independent of the temporal separation of the two laser

pulses or the laser powers, so the dynamic Stark eﬀect is negligible in our experiments.

The errors from the electronic noises, the uncertainties of the readouts of the barometer

and CAMAC modules, and the hyperﬁne structures of the barium isotopes with non-zero

nuclear spin (135Ba and 137Ba, both with I= 3/2) are also estimated. It is found that these

≈

systematic errors are negligible.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have measured the scalar and tensor polarizabilities of four even-parity

states of barium in the range of 35, 600 to 36, 000 cm−1, and the hyperpolarizabilities of two

of those four states. Three of these states have unusually large polarizabilities which exceed

the value that might be expected from the known energy levels of barium by more than

two orders of magnitude. Our experimental data suggest the existence of two “new” states.

These two states have been identiﬁed by direct laser spectroscopy of the Stark-induced

20

transitions and their energies have been determined to within

1 cm−1. The polarizabilities

of two odd-parity states excited via the Stark-induced transitions are measured. Using the

polarizabilities measured in this work, we have also derived seven electric dipole moments.

They relative values are consistent with the prediction of the LS

coupling scheme.

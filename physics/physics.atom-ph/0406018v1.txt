We have measured the ac-Stark shift of the 4s2 1S0 − 4s4p 3P1 line in 40Ca for perturbing laser
wavelengths between 780 nm and 1064 nm with a time domain Ramsey-Bord´e atom interferometer.
We found a zero crossing of the shift for the mS = 0−mP = 0 transition and σ polarized perturbation
at 800.8(22) nm. The data was analyzed by a model deriving the energy shift from known transition
wavelengths and strengths. To ﬁt our data, we adjusted the Einstein A coeﬃcients of the 4s3d 3D −
4s4p 3P and 4s5s 3S − 4s4p 3P ﬁne structure multiplets. With these we can predict vanishing
ac-Stark shifts for the 1S0 m = 0 − 3P1 m = 1 transition and σ−
light at 983(12) nm and at
735.5(20) nm for the transition to the 3P0 level.

INTRODUCTION

The realization of the SI second by the ground state hyperﬁne transition in Cs yields the by far best realization
of all SI units. Nevertheless, some optical frequency standards based on single ion traps [1, 2] or cold neutral atom
clouds [3, 4] are about to exceed the best microwave clocks in stability and accuracy. Due to the improved capabilities
of frequency transfer with fs-combs [5, 6] these standards can be evaluated more easily. Thus fast progress can be
expected. Recently, Katori and coworkers proposed and started to explore a so called “optical lattice clock” [7–9]. It
combines the advantages of ion and neutral atom frequency standards by using large particle numbers and a conﬁning
optical potential, which allows long interrogation times and eliminates the Doppler eﬀect and related uncertainty
contributions. The wavelength and polarization of the optical trapping ﬁeld are tailored such that both levels of
the clock transition have the same Stark shift. Hence, the transition energy can be observed without perturbations
by the trapping ﬁeld. The exact parameters have to be determined experimentally with high accuracy to meet the
requirements of a lattice clock, since up to now calculations do not reach the necessary precision.
In this article we present measurements of the Stark shift of the 40Ca 4s2 1S0 − 4s4p 3P1 transition to determine wave-
lengths leading to vanishing frequency shift of the intercombination line. Our data is analyzed by ﬁtting appropriate
oscillator strengths to match measured and calculated Stark shifts. The transition probabilities determined in this
way are compared to known values, which is especially of interest in cases where only theoretical results are available.

II. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION

The energy shift Ui(ω, p, mi) of an atomic state i with energy Ei and Zeeman level mi, which is induced by a
perturbing laser ﬁeld with frequency ν = ω/2π, polarization p, and irradiance I can be expressed in second-order
perturbation theory as Ui(ω, p, mi) = −αi(ω, p, mi)I/2ǫ0c with the induced polarizability αi. We calculated the latter
by summing the contributions from all dipole transitions from the desired state i to levels k with the respective Einstein
coeﬃcients Aki (spontaneous emission rate for Ek > Ei), Zeeman levels m′, and transition frequencies νik = ωik/2π

The expression in large brackets denotes a 3J-symbol [11].
It describes the selection rules and relative strengths
of the transitions depending on the involved angular momenta J, their projections m and the polarization p. The
transition frequencies and Aki coeﬃcients were taken from the comprehensive data collection of Kurucz [12]. Data
from other sources, both, theoretical [15–18] and experimental [14, 19, 23] will be discussed in Sec. IV. Additionally,
the inﬂuence of the continuum and highly excited states was approximated by using hydrogen wavefunctions [20]
similar to the method of von Oppen [21].
A simpliﬁed level scheme is shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 the function Ui(ω, p, mi) is depicted for diﬀerent polarizations,

2

Zeeman levels, selected levels and wavelengths. One observes that at the so called “magic wavelength” [9] (for
appropriate polarization of the perturbing ﬁeld) the shifts of 4s2 1S0 and 4s4p 3P1 states are the same and thus no
frequency shift of the intercombination line is observed. This occurs for σ polarized light and the mP = 0 Zeeman
sublevel of the 3P1 level around 800 nm, and at about 1000 nm for the mP = +1 (−1) level and σ− (σ+) light. In
the fermionic isotope, the transition 3P0 −1 S0 is allowed due to hyperﬁne level mixing. For this transition a “magic
wavelength” exists around 735 nm.
The ac-Stark shift of the 3P1 and 3P0 levels is dominated in the depicted wavelength interval by the 1.9 µm, 612 nm,
and 443 nm transitions shown in Fig. 1. Due to a vanishing value of the 3J-symbol in Eq. 1 some combinations
of Zeeman levels and polarizations do not couple to the 3S1 level by the 612 nm transition. E. g. in the case of
σ−-polarization, the m = −1 sublevel only couples to a m = −2 sublevel, which is not present in the 3S1 level and
thus the energy-shift Ui(ω, p, mi) for this combination has no pole at that wavelength.
For the prediction of the “magic wavelengths”, the 1.9 µm transition is of special interest, as its transition wavelength
is the only one larger than the “magic wavelengths”. Thus, only this line introduces negative contributions to
αi(ω, p, mi) in Eq. 1. Therefore, its transition strength has, together with the 612 nm transition, a crucial inﬂuence
on the slope of the curves in Fig. 2. The “magic wavelengths”, depicted by circles in Fig. 2, are sensitively inﬂuenced
by the counterplay of both A-coeﬃcients. The position of the crossings depends also on the ac-Stark shift of the
1S0 level, which is dominated by the 423 nm 1S0 −1 P1 transition. But its Einstein coeﬃcient is well known from
photoassociation spectroscopy [24] and the shift of the 1S0 level is therefore well known in this wavelength region.
Unfortunately, the published Einstein coeﬃcients of the 1.9 µm line diﬀer up to a factor of three (see Tab. I).

EXPERIMENT

To determine the light-induced shift of the 1S0 −3 P1 intercombination line in 40Ca one has to compare its transition
frequency in presence of the perturbing laser ﬁeld to the frequency in the non-perturbed case. We measured the tran-
sition frequency on a sample of laser-cooled atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) by time-domain Ramsey-Bord´e
atom interferometry. The experimental setup as well as the use of atom interferometry for the realization of an optical
frequency standard were described previously [3, 4, 25–27].
In the experiment, 107 calcium atoms were loaded from a thermal beam into a MOT and laser cooled within 20 ms
to about 3 mK on the strong 423 nm transition from the ground state to the 1P1 level. The quadrupole ﬁeld and
laser beams of the MOT were then switched oﬀ, a homogeneous magnetic bias ﬁeld was applied to separate the
Zeeman components of the triplet state by 3.8 MHz each, and the intercombination line was interrogated by two
counter-propagating laser pulse pairs during the expansion of the cold atomic cloud. The pulse separation within
one pair was 216.4 µs. The light was generated by a diode laser in Littman conﬁguration, which was locked by the
Pound-Drever-Hall method to a reference resonator. A line width of below 5 Hz and frequency drift below 0.5 Hz/s
were achieved. This laser served as master laser, whereas for each direction of pulse pairs, an injection-locked slave
diode was used to increase the power. The interrogation laser was stabilized to the central fringe of the Ramsey-Bord´e
interference pattern (FWHM: 1.16 kHz) by adjusting the frequency oﬀset between laser and reference cavity with an
acousto-optical modulator.
To measure the frequency shift due to the perturbing laser, we interleave two stabilization schemes with and without
perturbing laser. The diﬀerence between the respective oﬀset frequencies is the ac-Stark shift ∆ν of the intercombina-
tion line. This method suppresses systematic errors, e. g. frequency shifts due to misalignment of the interferometer.
To investigate the dependence on the wavelength of the perturbation, radiation from diﬀerent lasers was used. Near
780 nm, we applied a diode laser with semiconductor ampliﬁer (P = 300 mW at the atomic cloud). A multi-mode
ﬁber-couple diode bar was used at 810 nm (P = 900 mW). At 860, 890, and 922 nm, a Ti:Sapphire laser delivered
around P = 250 mW, and for 1064 nm, a Nd:YAG laser was available (P = 400 mW). The laser power was measured
with wavelength-insensitive thermal power meters, which were calibrated at 800 nm.
The radius w (1/e2 in irradiance) of these perturbing laser beams was typically in the order of 1 mm, while the
1σ-radius R of the atomic cloud at the end of the trapping phase was about 0.4 mm. Under these conditions observed
shifts are in the order of 10 Hz. The size of the beam is a compromise between high irradiance to achieve large
frequency shifts and a moderate spatial inhomogeneity of the perturbation in the region of the atomic cloud. To
take into account the residual inhomogeneity of the irradiance proﬁle of the laser beam, we averaged over the beam
and trap geometry. The laser beam was described as propagating in x-direction with constant radii wy and wz and
Gaussian proﬁle I(y, z) in radial direction. The measured density of the atomic cloud was well described as three

dimensional Gaussian proﬁle D(x, y, z) with Rx ≡ Ry 6= Rz. The observed frequency shift ∆ν is

Here, we utilize the function

s(ω, p, mP ) = [αP (ω, p, mP ) − αS(ω, p, 0)] /(2ǫ0hc),

which describes the frequency change of the intercombination line per unit irradiance of the perturbing ﬁeld.
Eq. 2 describes well the functional dependence on the geometrical quantities, as has been conﬁrmed experimentally.
However, it does not take into account the geometry of the spectroscopy and detection laser beams and the expansion
of the atomic cloud. All inﬂuences were modeled by a Monte-Carlo simulation, leading to an additional correction
depending on the actual conditions, but being always below ten percent.
The experimental setup required to have the perturbing beam propagating perpendicularly to the quantization axis
given by the magnetic bias ﬁeld. In this geometry, linearly polarized light with its electric ﬁeld vector parallel to the
quantization axis is described as π-polarization, while with 90◦ rotated polarization one realizes σ-polarization, which
can be decomposed into σ±-polarization.
For the mS = 0 → mP = 0 transition and π-light we ﬁnd an easy to interpret situation, while for σ± two ﬁeld
components have to be considered simultaneously. For symmetry reasons of the 3J-symbol in Eq. 1, σ+- and σ−-light
generate the same shifts on the m = 0 levels. Hence, the sum of these shifts is the same as for pure σ+- or σ−-light.
Fluctuations of the bias ﬁeld prevented the direct observation of frequency shifts in the 10 Hz range of the mP = ±1
Zeeman levels. Therefore, the spectroscopy laser was locked to the cross-over signal between the transitions to the ±1
Zeeman components. For this purpose, the bias ﬁled was reduced to allow for overlapping Doppler proﬁles of both
Zeeman levels. Nevertheless, the measurements showed increased frequency noise. The measured frequency shifts
for σ-polarized light determined in this way can be calculated as the average of the shifts for the transitions to the
mP = 1 with σ+- and σ−-light. From measurements of the mP = 1 cross-over with π-light no new information would
be gained here, because the ac-Stark shift is the same as for mP = 0 with σ-light.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The experiments described in the previous section yielded the values of s(λ, p, mP ) depicted in Fig. 3. The uncer-
tainties are due to noise of the measured frequency shift, uncertainty of the measured laser power (20 mW), uncertainty
of the determination of the atomic cloud size R and beam radius w (total contribution of 10 %), and possibly non
optimal overlap of laser beam and atomic cloud (10 %).
To describe the observed ac-Stark shifts and determine the “magic wavelength” by a physical meaningful interpola-
tion function (Eq. 3), the Einstein coeﬃcients of the 1.9 µm and 612 nm transitions were ﬁtted to the measured data
(Fig. 3). The former was chosen since it is not very well known (see Tab. I). It would have been suﬃcient to change
this value to match the zero-crossing observed for the mP = 0, σ case, but the absolute values of s, especially for
mP = 0, π would have been poorly described. Thus, A(612 nm) was also ﬁtted to the data. As discussed at the end
of Sec. II, the interplay of A(612 nm) and A(1.9 µm) is crucial for the wavelength, at which the eﬀective ac-Stark
shift of the intercombination line vanishes. Other transitions are far detuned and lead to a weak dependence of the
Stark shift on the wavelength in the investigated wavelength interval. Consequently, few information can be gained
about other transitions.
Our experimental data is very well reproduced by the ﬁt. In order to estimate the uncertainties of the so obtained
“magic wavelength” and Einstein coeﬃcients a Monte-Carlo simulation approach was used. Artiﬁcial data sets were
generated with a statistical distribution around the values calculated from the best ﬁt and a width of the distribution
according to the experimental uncertainty. An additional random parameter with average one and standard deviation
σ = 0.1 was used as common scaling factor for all data to account for systematic uncertainties like the measurement
of laser power. Then, these data sets were ﬁtted by Eq. 3 and the obtained values for the Aki’s and the “magic
wavelength” were utilized for the error analysis.
Fig. 4 shows the ﬁtted Einstein coeﬃcients of the ﬁne structure multiplets A(1.9 µm) and A(612 nm) of 2000 such
iterations. A clear correlation between both parameters is visible. The combined 68.3%-conﬁdence limits for both
parameters are also shown. The ﬁtted Aki’s are listed in Tab. I together with values from literature. All uncertainties
correspond to one standard deviation. Both A coeﬃcients agree within the uncertainties with theoretical [15–18]
and experimental [14, 19, 23] values from other authors. For the “magic wavelength” λ1
0,σ we found 800.8(22) nm.

Subscripts denote mP and the polarization, the superscript indicates the angular momentum J of the 3PJ state. The
uncertainty is one standard deviation of the distribution of values λ calculated from the artiﬁcial Monte-Carlo data
and parameter sets.
Furthermore, the ﬁtted parameters were cross checked by calculating the tensor polarizability αtens of the 3P1 level
and the diﬀerence ∆αscal of the scalar polarizabilities of this and the 1S0 state, from the expressions given by Angel
and Sanders [28]:

The expression in curly brackets is a 6J-symbol, analytical expressions are tabulated in e. g. [11]. For both val-
ues an uncertainty analysis as described above was performed. We found ∆αscal = 33(8) kHz/(kV/cm)2 and
αtens = 2.9(6) kHz/(kV/cm)2. Within the uncertainties, they agree well with αtens = 2.623(15) kHz/(kV/cm)2
as measured by Yanagimachi et al. [23] and the value of ∆αscal = 29.874(87) kHz/(kV/cm)2 one can calculate with
αtens from [23] and the Stark shift measurements of Li and van Wijngaarden [29]. Therefore, this check conﬁrmed
the results of our ﬁt, but it is not suited to determine ∆αscal or αtens more precisely.
If these polarizabilities with their small uncertainties are included in the ﬁt of the parameters A(612 nm) and
A(1.9 µm), these coeﬃcients are almost uniquely determined by the static polarizabilities and the ac-Stark data
is not well described. Therefore in principle the Einstein coeﬃcients of all transitions should be ﬁtted to the data,
which however is not feasible, as it would lead to an underdetermined set of least-square equations. To estimate the
inﬂuence of other transitions, we have included one of the Einstein coeﬃcients of the strong transitions from the 3P
level to the levels 4s4d 3D (443 nm), 4p2 3P (430 nm), 3d2 3P (300 nm), or 4s5d 3D (363 nm) in the ﬁtted parameters.
E.g. including the transition to the 4s4d 3D (443 nm) level in the ﬁt renders a good description of ∆αscal, αtens, and
of our measurements. A(443 nm) has to be changed by only -4 % with respect to the value given in [14]. Similar
results are obtained by ﬁtting the other coeﬃcients. The necessary variations are -1.5 %, -9 %, and -20 %, respectively.
When we included more lines in the ﬁt, no meaningful results could be obtained because of the least-square problem
starts to become underdetermined.
Values of λ1
0,σ, A(612 nm), and A(1.9 µm) determined this way do not depend on the choice of the additional line
and do not diﬀer within the uncertainties from the above discussed results. Only the uncertainty of the Einstein
coeﬃcients is reduced. This is due to a weaker correlation between A(612 nm) and A(1.9 µm) (compare Fig. 4), since
A(1.9 µm) strongly inﬂuences αtens. The average values of both coeﬃcients obtained in such ﬁts are listed in the
second row of Tab. I.
We have used the ﬁtted A’s to calculate the second “magic wavelength” of the 3P1, λ1
+1,σ− , and the one for the
3P0 level, λ0
0, to which the transition is allowed in the fermionic isotope. Both were not observed directly in the
experiment. The uncertainties were determined in the same way as for λ1
0,σ. The determined values are given in
Tab. II (uncertainties are one standard deviation), examples of the number distributions of the error analysis are
shown in Fig. 5. The results of ﬁts with or without including the polarizabilities in the dataset do not diﬀer within
the uncertainties.

V.

IMPLICATIONS FOR AN OPTICAL LATTICE CLOCK

Because the light shift in the 3P0 state of the fermionic isotope 43Ca is only very weakly dependent on the polarization
of the lattice laser [8], it seems to be the best candidate for an optical lattice clock. However, the low natural abundance
(0.135%) and its half-integer nuclear spin (I = 5/2) that leads to magnetic-ﬁeld sensitive transitions could become a
problem. For the use of the 3P1 state in an optical lattice clock the transition is dependent on the polarization of the
lattice laser with respect to the magnetic quantization ﬁeld. For a dipole laser of power 1 W focussed to a waist of
30 µm a trap depth of 35 µK is achieved with σ-polarization at the “magic wavelength” at 800 nm. The shift for the
“wrong” π-polarization amounts to δπ = 200 kHz. For a typical magnetic bias ﬁeld of B = 3 µT the magnetic ﬁeld
mostly determines the quantization axis, and the shift varies as δπ sin2(φ), where φ is the angular deviation from the
perpendicular direction. An experimentally achievable deviation of φ = 10 mrad would amount to a shift of 20 Hz.
However, as this shift depends on the power of the trap laser, it can be identiﬁed and corrected for, e. g. by a small
change in the wavelength of the trapping laser. We have calculated the shift for the combined electric and magnetic
ﬁelds by diagonalizing the total Hamiltonian. For the example given above we ﬁnd that at a frequency shift of 7 GHz
of the trapping laser the derivative of the light shift on the trapping laser power vanishes. Varying the power also

5

changes the eﬀective quantization axis for the combined E and B-ﬁelds. Thus the derivative depends on the power and
the light shift at this point is not precisely canceled. But even for a relatively small ﬁeld of 3 µT the quantization axis
is mainly deﬁned by the magnetic ﬁeld and the resulting frequency oﬀset from the unperturbed line is only 40 mHz.
Similar shifts have been found for residual ellipticity of the trapping laser beam of 4 × 10−5. Therefore also the 3P1
state could be employed in an optical lattice clock where the residual AC-Stark shift contributes less than 10−16 to
the uncertainty.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have measured the ac-Stark shift of the 40Ca intercombination line and analyzed our data by modeling the
wavelength dependence. Our data is well described after ﬁtting the Einstein coeﬃcients A of the transitions 4s3d 3D −
4s4p 3P and 4s5s 3S − 4s4p 3P to our data (Fig. 3). The A coeﬃcients agree with experimental results [14, 19, 23]
and conﬁrm recent theoretical calculations [15–18] of the oscillator strengths (Tab. I). The analysis allowed for the
determination of wavelengths, at which the energy shifts of both levels of the intercombination line are equal, the so
called “magic wavelengths” (Tab. II). We found “magic wavelengths” at 800.8(22) nm and 983(12) nm for the 3P1
level and 735.5(20) nm for the transition to the 3P0 level, which are of interest for optical lattice clocks. We have
proposed a method that is capable to reduce the inﬂuence of the trapping ﬁeld to below 10−16 even with moderate
requirements on the quality of its polarization.

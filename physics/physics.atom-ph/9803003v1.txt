I. INTRODUCTION

When dealing with the three-body variational problem with Hylleraas basis, it is usually

necessary to make extensive use of integrals of the general form

I(l, m, n; α, β, γ) =

dr1dr2 rl−1

where r1 = |r1|, r2 = |r2| and r12 = |r2 − r1|.

For the case of l, m and n non-negative (that is, non-negative powers of r1, r2 and
r12 once the volume element has been taken into account), powerful, simple and stable
recursive relations that permit the numerical calculation of these integrals can be found in
the literature [1]. However, it is sometimes essential to have also an expression for one of
the integer indices being negative. For instance, that happens in the atomic problem when
one wants to consider the mean value of the r−2
12 operator [2] or relativistic corrections [3]; or
in the nuclear problem when non-local terms are included in a Yukawa-like interaction [4].
In some cases, the integrals must be computed in every step of the non-linear optimization
procedure, and hence it is clear the need of having a quick and reliable algorithm to compute
them. The speciﬁc cases I(1, 1, −1) and I(0, −1, −1) were already considered in refs. [2] and
[5] respectively. For γ = 0 much work has been done [1,6–10], also including explicitly the
coupling of the angular momentum of the two dynamical particles [11]. Some work has been
devoted to the analogous integrals for four- or more-body problems [5,6,10,12,13].

II. GENERAL PROPERTIES OF I(l, m, n)

To study the general properties of the integral (1) for l, m and n (possibly negative)
integer numbers and α, β and γ real it is convenient to make use of perimetric coordinates
[14],

u = −r1 + r2 + r12
v = r1 − r2 + r12
w = r1 + r2 − r12

in terms of which the initial integral reads

I(l, m, n; α, β, γ) = 2−(l+m+n+3) Ip

The integral Ip is explicitly invariant under permutation of conjugated pairs of parameters
{(l, a), (m, b), (n, c)}, and therefore

symmetry that will be used throughout this work.

The long range convergence of Ip is ensured if a, b and c are positive real numbers, that

is, if

α + β > 0 , α + γ > 0

and β + γ > 0 .

(6)

That means that one of the exponentials parameters, α, β or γ, can be zero or negative,
provided that the other two are bigger than the absolute value of the former. Note also
that one of the exponential coeﬃcients of Ip can be zero if the power of the corresponding
integration variable is negative and high enough. For instance, a = 0 with l = 0 and
m = n = −1 would yield a convergent result. Anyhow, this is an almost useless case for
the variational problem, because for higher power integrals (that very likely should also be
considered) a = 0 would lead to divergent quantities. From now on, we assume that the
requirements (6) are fulﬁlled.

The study of the short range convergence can be straightforwardly done case by case.
Summarizing, for l, m and n integer, and α, β and γ real such that the conditions (6) are
fulﬁlled, the integral (1) is convergent if and only if

l ≥ −1 , m ≥ −1 , n ≥ −1

and l + m + n ≥ −2 .

(7)

To have a procedure to generate the whole set of integrals (1) one needs relations for the

cases I(l, m, −1) and I(l, −1, −1) where l and m are non-negative.

As soon as we have checked that the integral we are looking for is convergent, integration

over one parameter can be applied to lower the conjugated power,

I(l, m, n; α, β, γ) =

dc I(l, m, n + 1; α, β, c) .

On the other hand, derivation can always be used to increase indices,

(−∂α)pI(l, m, n; α, β, γ) = I(l + p, m, n; α, β, γ) .

These properties, together with

I(0, 0, 0; α, β, γ) = (α + β)−1(α + γ)−1(β + γ)−1 ,

are useful to derive all the integrals. Note also that for λ > 0

I(l, m, n; λα, λβ, λγ) = λ−(l+m+n+3)I(l, m, n; α, β, γ) ,

that is, for given l, m and n, I is a homogeneous function of α, β and γ.

α + β

α − β

For the family of integrals I(l, m, −1; α, β, γ) with l, m ≥ 0, a variation of the method

exposed in ref. [1] can be applied. The recursive relation that one gets is the following,

I(l, m, −1; α, β, γ) =

[lI(l − 1, m, −1) + mI(l, m − 1, −1) + B(l, m)] ,

(12)

where

B(l, m; α, β, γ) = l! m!

dc (α + c)−l−1 (β + c)−m−1 ,

(13)

∞

γ
Z

which is a symmetric function under (l, α) ↔ (m, β) exchange, can be obtained through the
relation

B(l, m) =

[lB(l − 1, m) − mB(l, m − 1) + C(l, m)] .

(14)

Here the function C(l, m) reads

(m − 1)! (β + γ)−m
−(l − 1)! (α + γ)−l
log (α+γ)
(β+γ)
0

l = 0 and m > 0
l > 0 and m = 0
l = 0 and m = 0

if

otherwise

(15)

C(l, m; α, β, γ) = 

and is deﬁned so that the recursion (14) holds also for l = m = 0 although B(0, −1) and
B(−1, 0) are divergent. Note that C(l, m) is antisymmetric under (l, α) ↔ (m, β).

Unfortunately, in the recursion (14) subtractions are involved, and hence one must look
over the stability against roundoﬀ, in particular when α and β are close to each other. We
shall study the numerical stability of this recursion below.

It is also possible to relate B(l, m) to Gauss hypergeometric function, 2F1 [15], yielding

B(l, m; α, β, γ) =

(α + γ)−l−1 (β + γ)−m

2F1(1, l + 1; m + l + 2; z) ,

(16)

l! m!
m + l + 1

where z ≡ α−β
representation of 2F1 is convergent.

α+γ . Using the symmetry of B(l, m) one can render |z| < 1, for which the series

From the deﬁnition (13) it is possible to prove the equation

B(l + 1, m) + B(l, m + 1) = l! m! (α + γ)−(l+1) (β + γ)−(m+1)

(l, m ≥ 0) .

(17)

Plugging this relation in Eq. (14) gives

(l + m) B(l − 1, m) − (α − β) B(l, m) − (l − 1)! m! (α + γ)−l (β + γ)−m = 0 ,

(18)

valid for m ≥ 0 and l > 0. This equation permits to lower one unit the index l of B(l, m)
with numerical stability if α > β. In the opposite case, the symmetry of B(l, m) can be
used to lower the index m (see Fig. 1).

4

On the other hand, using the Gauss relations for contiguous hypergeometric functions

one obtains

m B(l + 1, m − 1) + (m − l ξ) B(l, m) − l ξ B(l − 1, m + 1) = 0 ,

(19)

where ξ ≡ β+γ
α+γ . This relation deﬁnes a recursion that can be used to move on the diagonals
m + l =constant. As it is shown in Fig. 1, the straight line m(l) = ξ l on the l-m-plane
separates the stability regions of the recursion (19), so that one can move with stability from
this line in diagonal steps.

The ﬁnal recipe to compute the set of I(l, m, −1; α, β, γ) for l, m ≤ N is the following
(see Fig. 1). First, two B’s are to be computed numerically to the required accuracy, namely

(respectively, points P1 and P2 in Fig. 1). Then the recursion (19) is used to generate all
needed starting points to use the recursion (18) leftwards (downwards) if α > β (α < β).
Finally, the B’s obtained in this way are introduced in Eq. (12). To generate the two initial
B’s one can compute the hypergeometric function of Eq. (16) by adding up the corresponding
series or using its integral representation (§15.3.1 in ref. [15]). Of course it is also possible
to integrate by quadrature in Eq. (13).

Once we have an algorithm to compute extensively the integrals I(l, m, −1), we can check
the numerical stability obtained calculating the B’s using the recursion (14) upwards. This is
done in Fig. 2. For given β and γ the biggest relative error, E, associated to I(l, m, −1; 1, β, γ)
with l, m ≤ N is selected, and the quantity − log10 E, which gives the number of correct
ﬁgures, is represented in a contour graphics. Levels higher than 14 were identiﬁed, as well
as those lower than zero. The contours are only approximate, for the actual surfaces seem
to have a fractal structure. All the calculations were done in a double precision machine.
As expected, the loss of precision of using the recursion (14) increases when β approaches
α.

The particular case α = β is specially simple. Indeed, in that case the B function to be

included in Eq. (12) is

B(l, m; α, α, γ) =

l!m!
l + m + 1

(α + γ)−(l+m+1) ,

(20)

and the calculations are numerically stable. The case α = β is not only a mere academic
example. In many practical problems the variational basis is chosen so that any element has
the same exponential coeﬃcient both for the coordinates r1 and r2. If the physical problem
requires to deal with I(l, m, −1) integrals, then it is sensible to check whether such a basis
can produce the required accuracy. This selection was successfully used in the context of a
nuclear theory problem [4].

IV. CASE I(l, −1, −1) WITH l ≥ 0

To generate the set of integrals I(l, −1, −1) use can be made of the relation

5

α I(l, −1, −1; α, β, γ) − lI(l − 1, −1, −1; α, β, γ) = −βI(l − 1, 0, −1; α, β, γ) − γI(l − 1, −1, 0; α, β, γ) ,

which is valid for l > 0. This equation can be proved by induction. For l = 0 direct
calculation yields

I(0, −1, −1; α, β, γ) =

(see also ref. [5]), where dilog(z) is the dilogarithm function [15].

The recursion (21), which is numerically unstable upwards, can be used with stability to
decrease the index l if α > 0, which is the interesting case in physics. But then, one needs as
starting point the integral with the highest wanted l. As it can be derived from Eqs. (8-10),
that integral can be obtained through the computation of l + 1 quadratures as shown:

I(l, −1, −1; α, β, γ) = l!

D(l − m, m; α, β, γ)

V. SUMMARY

Some recursive relations to compute the integrals (1) for all negative integer parame-
ters (l, m and n) have been presented. The stability of these recursions has been inves-
tigated, and algorithms have been given to use them with full accuracy. The integrals
I(l, m, −1; α, β, γ) (where l, m ≥ 0) can be generated at low computing cost. For the in-
tegrals I(l, −1, −1; α, β, γ) N + 1 one-dimensional quadratures are needed, where N is the
highest required l and α is assumed to be positive. Specially simple algorithms are given for
the cases I(l, m, −1; α, α, γ), I(l, −1, −1; 0, β, γ) and I(l, −1, −1; α, α, α).

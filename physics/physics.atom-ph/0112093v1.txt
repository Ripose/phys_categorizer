We performed accurate calculation of α-dependence (α = e2/hc) of the transition frequencies for
ions, which are used in a search for the variation of the ﬁne structure constant α in space-time.
We use Dirac-Hartree-Fock method as a zero approximation and then the many-body perturbation
theory and conﬁguration interaction methods to improve the results. An important problem of level
pseudocrossing (as functions of α) is considered. Near the crossing point the derivative of frequencies
over α varies strongly (including change of the sign). This makes it very sensitive to the position
of the crossing point. We proposed a semiempirical solution of the problem which allows to obtain
accurate results.

INTRODUCTION

Recently there was an intensive discussion of the pos-
sible space-time variation of the ﬁne structure constant
α = e2/hc at the cosmological scale. The ﬁrst evidence
for such variation has been reported in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
from the analysis of the astrophysical data. These results
are to be compared with the number of experimental up-
per bounds on this variation obtained from other astro-
physical observations (see, e.g.
[7, 8, 9]) and from the
precision laboratory measurements [10, 11, 12]. Recently
a number of new laboratory tests have been proposed
(see, e.g.
[13]). The analysis of the microwave back-
ground radiation can also give some restrictions on time
variation of α as suggested in [14, 15, 16].
Implemen-
tations of the space-time variation of the ﬁne structure
constant to the theory of the fundamental interactions
are discussed e.g. in Refs. [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] (see
also disscussion and references in [3]).

The most straitforward way to look for the variation of
α is to measure the ratio of some ﬁne structure interval
to an optical transition frequency, such as ω(np1/2 →
np3/2) and ω(n′s1/2 → np3/2) [37]. This ratio can be
roughly estimated as 0.2 α2Z 2, where Z is the nuclear
charge [24]. Therefore, any diﬀerence in this ratio for
a laboratory experiment and a measurement for some
distant astrophysical object can be easily converted into
the space-time variation of α. However, as it was pointed
out in [25], one can gain about an order of magnitude
in the sensitivity to the α-variation by comparing optical
transitions for diﬀerent atoms. In this case the frequency
of each transition can be expanded in a series in α2:

ωi = ω(0)

i + ω(2)
i α2 + . . .
= ωi,lab + qix + . . . ,

where α0 stands for the laboratory value of the ﬁne struc-

ture constant. Note, that Eq. (1a) corresponds to the
expansion at α = 0, while Eq. (1b) — to the expansion
at α = α0. In both cases parameters ω(2)
and qi appear
due to relativistic corrections.

i

For a ﬁne structure transition the ﬁrst coeﬃcient on
the right hand side of (1a) turns to zero, while for the
optical transitions it does not. Thus, for the case of a
ﬁne structure and an optical transition one can write:

Quite often the coeﬃcients ω(2)
for optical transitions are
i
about an order of magnitude larger than corresponding
coeﬃcients for the ﬁne structure transitions ω(2)
(this is
fs
because the relativistic correction to a ground state elec-
tron energy is substantially larger than the spin-orbit
splitting in an excited state [25, 26]). Therefore, the
ratio (3) is, in general, more sensitive to the variation
It is also important that the

signs of coeﬃcients ω(2)
in (3) can vary. For example,
for s-p transitions the relativistic corrections are positive
while for d-p transitions they are negative. This allows to
suppress possible systematic errors which “do not know”
about the signs and magnitude of the relativistic correc-
tions [25]. On the other hand, for many cases of interest,
the underlying atomic theory is much more complicated
for Eq. (3). In particular, the most diﬃcult case corre-
sponds to transitions to highly excited states of a multi-
electron atom, where the spectrum is very dense. And
this happens to be a typical situation for astrophysical
spectra, in particular, for large cosmological red shifts.
Corresponding atomic calculations have to account very
accurately for the electronic correlations, which may af-
fect such spectra quite dramatically.

The ﬁrst calculations of the coeﬃcients q from Eq. (1)
for the transitions suitable for astronomical and labora-
tory measurements were done in Refs. [25, 26, 27, 28].
Here we present a new and more accurate calculations of
the coeﬃcients q for the transitions, which are currently
used in the analysis of the astrophysical data. A full list
of these transitions was given in [3]. We have not re-
calculated here the lightest and the most simple atoms
Mg and Al, for which the previous calculation [25] should
be suﬃciently accurate and focused on more complicated
ions Si II, Cr II, Fe II, Ni II, and Zn II. Our ﬁnal results
for them are given in Table I. Note, that here we use the
single parameter q instead of two parameters q1 and q2
used in the earlier works and q ≡ ∂ω/∂x|x=0 = q1 + 2q2.
Details of the calculations and discussion of the accuracy
will be given in Sec. III. Before that we brieﬂy address
few theoretical points in Sec. II.

II. THEORY

In order to ﬁnd parameters q = ∂ω/∂x|x=0 in Eq. (1)
we perform atomic calculations for three values of x:
x− = −1/8, x0 = 0, and x+ = 1/8. That allows us
to determine q: q = 4 (ω(x+) − ω(x−)) and also estimate
the second derivative ∂2ω/∂x2|x=0. The large value of
the latter signals that interaction between levels is strong
(level pseudocrossing), and there is a risk of large errors.
For these cases further analysis was done as described
below.

a. Relativistic calculations of multi-electron ions.
In
order to accurately account for the dominant relativis-
tic eﬀects we use the Dirac-Hartree-Fock approximation
as a starting point for all calculations of atomic spec-
tra. Though most of the calculations were done for the

2

Coulomb potential, we have also estimated Breit correc-
tions by including the magnetic part of the Breit inter-
action in the self-consistent ﬁeld [29].

The ions we are dealing with in this paper have from
one to nine electrons in the open shells. For one valence
electron in Zn II the Dirac-Fock V N −1 approximation
already gives rather good results. On the next step the
core-valence correlations can be accounted for by means
of the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Already
the second order MBPT correction allows to reproduce
the spectrum with the accuracy, better than 1%, which
is more than suﬃcient for our current purposes.

Other ions of interest to us have at least three valence
electrons. Here the dominant correlation correction to
transition frequencies corresponds to the valence-valence
correlations. This type of correlations can be accounted
for with conﬁguration interaction (CI) method. If neces-
sary, the core-valence correlations can be included within
combined CI+MBPT technique [30]. The latter usually
provides an accuracy of the order of 1% or better for the
lower part of the spectra of atoms and ions with two or
three valence electrons [30, 31, 32]. However, the accu-
racy of ab initio methods decreases with the number of
valence electrons and with excitation energy. Indeed, for
a large number of valence electrons and/or suﬃciently
high excitation energy the spectrum becomes dense and
the levels with the same exact quantum numbers strongly
interact with each other. The part of the spectrum of Fe
II above 55000 cm−1 and, to a somewhat lesser extent,
the spectrum of Ni II represent this situation. There-
fore, for these ions we developed a semiempirical ﬁtting
procedure, which is described below.

In order to have additional control of the accuracy of
our CI we performed calculations for most of the ions
with two diﬀerent computer packages. One package was
used earlier in Refs. [30, 32, 33] and another one was
used in Refs. [3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31]. The former pack-
age allows to construct ﬂexible basis sets and optimize
conﬁguration space, while the latter allows for a larger
CI space as it works with the block of the Hamiltonian
matrix, which corresponds to a particular total angular
momentum of atom J. When there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between two calculations, we only give results
obtained with the ﬁrst package. Nevertheless, our ﬁnal
results presented in Table I are based on both calcula-
tions.

b. Semiempirical treatment of the strong interaction
of levels: pseudo-crossing.
In the nonrelativistic limit
α → 0, all multi-electron states are accurately described
by the LS-coupling scheme: Eα→0 = Ep,n,L,S,J, where
p = ±1 is the parity and n numerates levels with the
same p, L,S, and J. For suﬃciently small values of α the
LS-coupling holds and the energy has the form:

Ep,n,L,S,J = E(0)

p,n,L,S +

Cp,n,L,S

(cid:19)

where the ﬁrst term in the parentheses gives the slope
for the centre of the multiplet and the second term gives
the ﬁne structure. With growing α the multiplets start
to overlap and when the levels with the same p and J
come close, the pseudo-crossing takes place.

Near the pseudo-crossing the slope of the energy curves
changes dramatically. If such crossing takes place at x ≈
0, where x is deﬁned by Eq. (1), i.e. near the physical
value of α, it can cause signiﬁcant uncertainty in the
values of parameters q.

Let us ﬁrst analyze the behaviour of the slopes q(x)
in the vicinity of the pseudo-crossing in the two-level ap-
proximation. Consider two levels E1 and E2 which cross
at x = xc:

E1 = q1(x − xc),
E2 = q2(x − xc).

(5a)
(5b)

If the interaction matrix element between these two levels
is V , the exact adiabatic levels will be

(q1 + q2)(x − xc)

(q1 − q2)2(x − xc)2 + 4V 2

.
(cid:19)

It is easy now to calculate the energy derivative in respect
to x in terms of the mixing angle φ between unperturbed
states 1 and 2:

∂Ea,b
∂x

= cos2φ q1,2 + sin2φ q2,1.

(7)

Note, that at the crossing the angle φ varies from
0 on one side through π/4 in the centre to π/2 on
the other side, which leads to the change of the slope
qa(x) = ∂Ea/∂x from q1 through (q1 + q2)/2 to q2. The
narrow crossings with small V are particularly danger-
ous, as the slopes change very rapidly within the interval
∆x ≈ V /|q1 − q2|. Then, even small errors in the posi-
tion of the crossing point xc, or the value of V can cause
large errors in qa,b. In this model we assume that non-
diagonal term V = const. For the real atom V ∝ α2.
However, if the crossing region ∆x ≪ 1, we can neglect
the dependence of V on α.

c. Semiempirical treatment of the strong interaction
of levels: multi-level case. Eq. (7) can be easily gener-
alized to a multi-level case as it simply gives the slope
of a physical level a as a weighted average of the mixed
levels. Thus, if the level a can be expressed as a linear
combination of some unperturbed LS-states ψLn,Sn:

|ai =

Cn|ψLn,Sn i,

n
X

the resultant slope qa is given by:

qa =

C2

n qn.

X

(9)

Here again we neglect weak dependence of interaction V
on x in comparison to strong dependence of C2
n on x near
crossing points.

Eq. (9) allows to improve ab initio coeﬃcients q if we
can ﬁnd the expansion coeﬃcients Cn in Eq. (8). That
can be done, for example, by ﬁtting g-factors. The mag-
netic moment operator µ = g0(L + 2S) is diagonal in L
and S and, therefore, does not mix diﬀerent LS-states.
Thus, in the LS-basis the resultant g-factor for the state
a has exactly the same form as qa:

ga =

C2

n gn.

(10)

n
X
If the experimental g-factors are known, one can use
Eq. (10) to ﬁnd weights C2
n and, then ﬁnd the corrected
values of the slopes qa.

Sometimes, the experimental data on g-factors are in-
complete. Than, one can still use a simpliﬁed version of
Eqs. (9) and (10):

ga = C2g0

a + (1 − C2) ¯g, ⇒ C2 =

qa = C2q0

a + (1 − C2) ¯q.

ga − ¯g
g0
a − ¯g

, (11a)

(11b)

C2 here is the weight of the dominant LS-level in the ex-
perimental one, and the bar means the averaging over the
admixing levels. Of course, there is some arbitrariness in
calculation of averages ¯g and ¯q. However, the advantage
of Eqs. (11) is that only one experimental g-factor is re-
quired.

III. DETAILS OF THE CALCULATION AND
RESULTS

As we mentioned above, we performed calculations of
energy levels for three values of the parameter x: x− =
−1/8, x0 = 0, and x+ = 1/8. All three calculations were
done at exactly same level of approximation, to minimize
the error caused by the incompleteness of the basis sets
and conﬁguration sets. From these calculations we found
two approximations for q: q− = 8(ω(x0) − ω(x−)) and
q+ = 8(ω(x+)− ω(x0)). If there were problems with level
identiﬁcation we performed additional calculation for x =
0.01, where the LS-coupling should be very accurate and
identiﬁcation is straitforward. The noticeable diﬀerence
between q− and q+ signaled the possibility of the level
crossing.
In these cases we applied the semiempirical
procedure described in Sec. II to ﬁnd the corrected values
for q; otherwise, we simply took the average: q = (q+ +
q−)/2.

A. Zn II

Zn II has the ground state conﬁguration [1s2 . . . 3d10]4s
and we are interested in the 4s → 4pj transitions. As
the theory here is much simpler than for other ions, we

used Zn II to study the importance of the core-valence
correlation correction and Breit correction to the slopes
q. The former correction was calculated in Brueckner
approximation:

(HDHF + Σ(E)) Ψ = EΨ,

(12)

with the self-energy operator Σ(E) calculated in the sec-
ond order of MBPT (the perturbation here is the diﬀer-
ence between the exact and Dirac-Hartree-Fock Hamil-
tonians, V = H − HDHF). The HDHF was calculated
with the magnetic part of the Breit operator included
self-consistently. The retardation part of the Breit op-
erator is known to be signiﬁcantly smaller [29] and we
completely neglected it here.

The results of our calculations of the frequencies ω and
the slopes q for two transitions 4s → 4pj, j = 1/2, 3/2
are given in Table II. One can see, that both Brueckner-
Coulomb and Brueckner-Coulomb-Breit approximations
give very good transition frequencies, accurate to 0.2%,
though the latter slightly underestimates the ﬁne split-
ting. Breit correction to the parameters q does not exceed
1%, while core-valence correlations account for the 17%
correction.

In Table II we did not give separately the values of q±.
The diﬀerence between them is close to 1%. Indeed, in
the absence of close interacting levels the dependence of
q on x arise from the corrections to the energy of the
order of α4Z 4, which are very small.

B. Si II

Si II has three valence electrons and the ground state
conﬁguration [1s2 . . . 2p6]3s23p. Excited conﬁgurations
of interest are 3s3p2 and 3s24s. We made the CI cal-
culation in the Coulomb approximation on the basis set,
which included 1s − 8s, 2p − 8p, 3d − 8d, and 4f, 5f
orbitals, which we denote as the basis set [8spd5f]. Note,
that we use virtual orbitals, which are localized within
the atom [34], rather than Dirac-Fock ones. This pro-
vides fast convergence. CI included all single-double (SD)
and partly triple excitations from three valence conﬁgu-
rations listed above. The results of these calculations are
given in Table III.

Like in Zn, the left and write derivatives q− and q+
are close to each other, and all levels with equal exact
quantum numbers are well separated. The astrophysical
data exist for the levels 2S1/2 and 2D5/2. The former cor-
responds to the 3p → 4s transition and has small slope
q, while the latter corresponds to the 3s → 3p transition
and has much larger positive q. That is in agreement with
the fact, that relativistic corrections to the energy usu-
ally decrease with the principle quantum number n and
with the orbital quantum number l. Therefore, for the
ns → np transition one should expect large and positive
q, while for np → (n + 1)s, there should be large can-
cellation of relativistic corrections to upper and to lower
levels, resulting in smaller q (see disscussion in [25, 26]).
The dominant correction to our results should be from
the core-valence correlations. In the recent calculations of
Mg, which has the same core as Si II, the core-valence cor-
rections to transition frequencies were found to be about
4% [33, 36]. We conservatively estimate corresponding
correction to q to be 6% of the larger q, i.e. 30 cm−1.

C. Cr II

Cr II has the ground state conﬁguration [1s2 . . . 3p6]3d5
with ﬁve valence electrons. The astrophysical data cor-
respond to the 3d → 4p transition, for which one may
expect negative value of q. CI calculations here are much
more complicated, than for Si II. There is strong relax-
ation of the 3d shell in the discussed transition, which
requires more basic d-orbitals. Therefore, we used the
[6sp9d6f] basis set.
In CI we included only single and
double (SD) excitations. Some of the triple, quadruple,
and octuple excitations were accounted for by means of
the second order perturbation theory. It was found that
corresponding corrections to transition frequencies were
of the order of few percent, and were even smaller for pa-
rameters q. In general, these corrections did not improve
the agreement with the experiment, so we present only
CI results in Table IV.

As we mentioned above, there is strong relaxation of
the 3d-shell in the 3d → 4p transition. We were not
able to saturate CI space and completely account for this

relaxation. Because of that, we estimate the error for q
here to be close to 10%.

We have seen before for Zn II and Si II, that in the
absence of level-crossing the diﬀerence between q+ and
q− is smaller than other theoretical uncertainties. In Cr
II there are no close levels which may interact with each
other, so in the calculation presented in Table IV we de-
termined only the right derivative q+.
In calculations
with diﬀerent basis sets we checked that the diﬀerence
between q+ and q− is much smaller than the given above
theoretical error (see Table I).

D. Fe II

Fe II ion has 7 valence electrons in conﬁguration 3d64s
and represents the most complicated case. The astro-
physical data includes 5 lines in the band 38000 cm−1–
43000 cm−1and two lines with the frequency close to
62000 cm−1. The ﬁrst band consists of three close, but
separated multiplets with a regular ﬁne structure split-
tings. The 62000 cm−1band is completely diﬀerent as the
multiplets here strongly overlap and ﬁne structure inter-
vals are irregular [35]. Characteristic distance between
the levels with identical exact quantum numbers is few
hundred cm−1, which is comparable to the ﬁne structure
splittings. This means that the levels strongly interact
and even their identiﬁcation may be a problem.

In fact, in Moore Tables [35] one of the multiplets of
interest, namely y 6P o, is erroneously assign to the con-
ﬁguration 3d6(7S)4p. It is an obvious misprint, as there
is no term 7S for conﬁguration 3d6. This term appears,
however, in the conﬁguration 3d5 and the correct assign-
ment of this multiplet should be 3d5(7S)4s4p. This as-
signment is in agreement with our calculations and with
the experimental g-factor of the level with J = 7/2. We
checked that all close levels of the conﬁguration 3d64p
have signiﬁcantly smaller g-factors.

This reassignment has dramatic consequences in terms

FIG. 1: Examples of typical interaction of levels in the upper
band of Fe II. Levels are shown in arbitrary units as function
of (α/α0)2 = x + 1. Levels of conﬁguration 3d64p have similar
slopes and strongly interact with each other. That causes
wide pseudo-crossings, similar to one shown on the left side
of the plot. The level 6P o
7/2 of the conﬁguration 3d54s4p moves
in the opposite direction. A series of sharp pseudo-crossings
takes place near the physical value of α, marked by a vertical
dotted line.

of the corresponding parameter q as conﬁgurations 3d64p
(4s − 4p transition from the ground state) and 3d54s4p
(3d − 4p transition) move in the opposite directions from
the ground state conﬁguration 3d64s when x is changed.
It also causes a number of pseudo-crossings to occur right
in the vicinity of x = 0 (see Fig. 1).

CI calculations for Fe II were done on the basis set
[6spdf] in the SD approximation (see Table V). Triple
excitations were included within second order perturba-
tion theory and corresponding corrections were found to
be relatively small. One can see from Table V that for the
lower band both frequencies and g-factors are reproduced
rather accurately.

7/2 and 4F o

The ﬁrst anomaly takes place at 44000 cm−1, where
the levels 4Do
7/2 appear in the reverse order.
Theoretical g-factors are also much further from LS val-
ues (1.429 and 1.238). That means that theoretical levels
are at pseudo-crossing, while experimental levels already
passed it. Indeed, calculations for x = 1/8 show that the
right order of levels is restored, though the g-factors are
still too far from LS values.

The second anomaly corresponds to the band above
60000 cm−1. Here the order of calculated levels diﬀers
from that of the experimental ones. Note, that for this
band only levels of negative parity with J = 7/2 are
given in Table V. Thus, all of them can interact with
each other. Let us estimate, how this interaction can

7/2 and 6P o

Five levels from this band belong to conﬁguration
3d64p and have close slopes with the average ¯q =
1360 cm−1. Only the level 4F o
7/2 has the slope, which
is 300 cm−1 smaller, than the average. The remaining
7/2 belongs to conﬁguration 3d54s4p and has the
level 6P o
slope of the opposite sign q1 = −1519 cm−1. Its abso-
lute value is 500 cm−1 smaller, than for the level 8P o
7/2
of the same conﬁguration 3d54s4p. That suggests that
the levels 4F o
7/2 strongly interact with each
other. This is also in agreement with the fact, that
these levels are the closest neighbors both experimen-
tally and theoretically and that they cross somewhere
between x− and x. There is also strong interaction be-
tween the levels 2Go
7/2. That can be
seen if one calculates the scalar products (overlaps) be-
tween corresponding wave functions for diﬀerent values
of x, such as: hi(x−)|k(x+)i. For weekly interacting lev-
els hi(x−)|k(x0)i ≈ hi(x−)|k(x+)i ≈ δi,k, so large non-
diagonal matrix elements signal, that corresponding lev-
els interact.

Eq. (15) corresponds to the correction δq = +177. There-
fore, for the closest level 4F o
7/2 this model gives an esti-
mate:

q(4F o

7/2) = ¯q − δq = 1120.

(16)

Eqs. (15) and (16) show that correction for the mix-
ing is not very large. That corresponds to the fact that
experimental g-factor of the level 6P o
7/2 is signiﬁcantly
larger than any g-factors of the levels of the conﬁguration
3d64p. Thus, the interaction for this level is relatively
small. On the contrary, the levels of the conﬁguration
3d64p strongly interact with each other, but correspond-
ing changes of the slopes are also relatively small (since
the q values for these strongly interacting levels are ap-
proximately the same).

We estimate the accuracy of our calculations for the
lower band of Fe II to be about 150 cm−1, and approxi-
mately 300 cm−1 for the values (15) and (16).

Now we can use experimental g-factor of the state 6P o

Ni II has the ground state conﬁguration 3d9. The spec-
trum is somewhat simpler, than for Fe II. There are also

¯q = 1297.

pseudo-crossings here, but they either lie far from x = 0,
or are rather wide. That makes their treatment slightly
easier. Nevertheless, our results signiﬁcantly diﬀer from
previous calculations [28].

CI calculations were done for the Coulomb potential
and included SD and partly triple excitations on the ba-
sis set [5spdf]. We calculated 5 lower odd levels with
J = 5/2 and 5 with J = 7/2 for x−, x0, and x+, and used
parabolic extrapolation for the interval −0.4 ≤ x ≤ +0.3
(see Fig. 2). It is seen that the theory accurately repro-
duce relative positions of all levels. An overall agreement
between the theory and the experiment becomes close to
perfect if all experimental levels are shifted by 1000 cm−1
down, as it is done in Fig. 2. Note, that this shift consti-
tutes only 2% of the average transition frequency.

Calculated g-factors are generally in agreement with
the experiment [35] and noticeably diﬀerent from the
pure LS-values (see Table VI). However, for the level
2F o
7/2 theoretical g-factor is smaller than the LS value,
while experimental one is larger. There are no nearby
levels who may mix to this one and move g-factor closer
to experiment. On the other hand, the diﬀerence with
experiment is only 2% and may be within experimental
accuracy.

7/2 and 2F o

Fig. 2 shows that the levels 2Go

7/2 cross at
x ≈ 0.3 and they already strongly interact at x = 0.
Theoretical splitting for these levels is 10% larger than
experimental one. Thus, they are in fact even closer to
the crossing point than is predicted by the theory. The
experimental splitting is equal to the theoretical one for
larger value of α corresponding to x ≈ 0.15. At x = 0.15
the slopes of these levels are −265 and −590, and for x =
0 they are −124 and −812 correspondingly. Note, that
the sum of the slopes at x = 0.15 diﬀers by 80 cm−1 from
the sum at x = 0. According to Eq. (7) for a two-level
system the sum is constant. This means that these two
levels repel from the lower lying level 4F o
7/2. Taking this
analysis into account we suggest an average between x =
0 and x = 0.15 as our ﬁnal value: q(2F o
7/2) = −700(250).

Conclusions

In this paper we present new reﬁned calculations of
the parameters q, which determine α-dependence of the
transition frequencies for a number of ions used in the
astrophysical search for α-variation. These ions appear
to be very diﬀerent from the theoretical point of view.
Because of that we had to use diﬀerent methods and dif-
ferent levels of approximation for them. The ﬁnal accu-
racy of our results diﬀers not only for diﬀerent ions, but
also for diﬀerent transitions.

The simplest system is Zn II, which has one valence
electron. On the other hand, this is the heaviest ion and
it has the largest core, which includes 3d10-shell. That
gave us the opportunity to study corrections to q from the
core-valence correlations and from Breit interaction. We
found the former to be about 17% and the latter to be less
than 1%. For lighter ions Breit interaction should be even
smaller and can be safely neglected. Other ions also have
much smaller and more rigid cores, so one might expect
that core-valence correlations are few times weaker there
in comparison to Zn. That allows us to neglect core-
valence correlations for all other ions discussed in this
paper.

Si II has the smallest core 1s2 . . . 2p6 and three valence
electrons. For neutral Mg, which has the same core, the
core-valence corrections to the 3s → 3p transition fre-
quencies were found to be about 4% [33, 36]. CI calcula-
tion for Si II is relatively simple and the errors associated
with incompleteness of CI space are small. Thus, our es-
timate of the accuracy for Si on 6% level seems to be
rather conservative.

Cr, Fe, and Ni have the core 1s2 . . . 3p6 and the core
excitation energy varies from 2 a.u. for Cr II to 2.6 a.u.
for Ni II. In comparison, the core excitation energy for
Zn II is 0.9 a.u. Therefore, we estimate the core-valence
correlation corrections for these ions to be at least two
times smaller, than for Zn II.

Additional error here is associated with incomplete-
ness of the CI space. These ions have from 5 to 9 valence
electrons and CI space can not be saturated. To estimate
corresponding uncertainty we performed several calcula-
tions for each ion using diﬀerent basis sets and two dif-
ferent computer packages described in Sec. II. The basic
Dirac-Hartree-Fock orbitals were calculated for diﬀerent
conﬁgurations (for example, for the ground state conﬁg-
uration and for excited state conﬁguration, etc.).

Supplementary information on the accuracy of our cal-
culations can be obtained from comparison of calculated
spectra and g-factors with experimental values. The later
appear to be very important as they give information
about electron coupling, which depends on relativistic
corrections and on interaction between LS-multiplets.
Our results for Cr II appear to be very close for dif-
ferent calculations and are in good agreement with the
experiment both in terms of the gross level structure and
spin-orbit splittings (see Table IV), so we estimate our
ﬁnal error here to be about 10 – 12%.

The largest theoretical uncertainties appear for Fe II
and Ni II where the number of valence electrons is largest
and the interaction of levels is strongest. Here we had
to include semi-empirical ﬁts to improve the agreement
between the theory and the experiment. We took into
account the size of these semi-empirical corrections in
estimates of the accuracy of the calculated values of q.

The ﬁnal results are presented in Table I. Note again,
that they are based on several independent calculations
performed using two diﬀerent computer codes. Some of

the intermediate results are given in Table II – Table VI.

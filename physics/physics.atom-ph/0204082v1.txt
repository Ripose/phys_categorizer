Suppression of inhomogeneous broadening in rf spectroscopy of optically trapped
atoms

We present a novel method for reducing the inhomogeneous frequency broadening in the hyperﬁne
splitting of the ground state of optically trapped atoms. This reduction is achieved by the addition
of a weak light ﬁeld, spatially mode-matched with the trapping ﬁeld and whose frequency is tuned
in-between the two hyperﬁne levels. We experimentally demonstrate the new scheme with 85Rb
atoms, and report a 50-fold narrowing of the rf spectrum.

The time available for measuring an atomic transition
in a perturbation-free environment has been substan-
tially increased by the achievement of ultracold atomic
samples. Using cold atoms in atomic fountains, mea-
surements of the 9.2 GHz ”clock” transition in Cesium
were performed with measurement times as long as 450
ms[1]. A possible way to increase the measurement time
beyond the practical limit imposed by the height of a
fountain is to use optically trapped atoms[2, 3]. Far-oﬀ-
resonance optical traps (FORTs)[4], which are based on
the conservative dipole force created by cycles of absorp-
tion and stimulated emission, are possible candidates for
these measurements. The great disadvantage of a trap,
is that the trapping potential acts also as a perturba-
tion for the atomic level, and in particular an optical
trap introduces a relative ac Stark shift of the hyperﬁne
levels[5], which results in a systematic shift in the clock
frequency measurement. When ensemble-averaged, the
spatial dependence of the potential also results in a in-
homogeneous broadening of the transition, and hence in
a loss of atomic coherence at a much faster rate than the
spontaneous photon scattering rate[5]. These eﬀects can
be reduced by increasing the trap detuning [4, 5, 6, 7]
and by using blue-detuned optical traps, in which the
atoms are conﬁned mainly in the dark[5, 8]. However,
the residual frequency shifts are still the main limiting
factor for precision spectroscopy in optical traps.

ac Stark shifts from the trapping beams are also detri-
mental to achieving high phase space densities in optical
traps, since they shift the atom’s resonance frequency
away from the cooling beams frequency [9, 10]. Recently,
it was shown that in some cases a FORT laser frequency
can be chosen to couple the states involved in cooling to
some other states, in order to suppress the frequency shift
of the cooling transition and allow simultaneous trapping
and Doppler cooling[11]. In this way, a phase-space den-
sity exceeding 0.1 was achieved.

In this letter, we demonstrate a method for reducing
the inhomogeneous broadening in the spectroscopic mea-
surement of the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state of
optically trapped atoms. This reduction is achieved by

the addition of a very weak light ﬁeld (the so-called com-
pensating beam), spatially mode-matched with the trap-
ping ﬁeld and whose frequency is tuned between the two
hyperﬁne levels. An experimental realization of the new
scheme is presented with 85Rb atoms, and a reduction
by a factor 50 is reported. This method can be applied
to red- or blue-detuned FORTs, and hence can be used
as an additional way to further increase the long atomic
coherence times of the latter.

A ground state |gii of an atom exposed to a light ﬁeld
with intensity I and frequency ω, is ac Stark shifted by
an amount given by:

where γ is the natural width of the transition[2]. The

tive transition coeﬃcient cij , and detuning δij = ω − ωij.
Speciﬁcally for the D2 line in 85Rb, the ﬁne structure
of the excited state (∆′

structure of the ground state (∆HF ∼ 3 GHz) and excited
state (∆′

For linearly polarized light in the vicinity of this line, and
as long as the detuning of the light is large as compared
to the excited state hyperﬁne splitting ∆′

result can be derived from Eq. 1 for the shift of a ground

where U (r) is the spatially dependent dipole potential

the relative ac Stark shift is ∆HF (cid:30)δ smaller than the
dipole potential, is the main motivation for using FORTs
for precision spectroscopy. For example in Ref.
[5] the
relative ac Stark shifts were only ∆HF (cid:30)δ ≈ 2 · 10−4
times the dipole potential. Note that, however small,
this relative ac Stark shift is still much larger than the
spontaneous photon scattering rate [5].

In order to cancel these shifts, we introduce an ad-

between the resonant frequencies of the two ground

and +∆HF /2 from the lower and higher hyperﬁne level
respectively[14]. For a FORT, the total shift is obtained

Fig. 1 shows the shift of the hyperﬁne levels (a) and
the hyperﬁne energy diﬀerence (b) caused by the trap-
ping beam (dashed line) and compensating beam (dotted
line). In the presence of both beams, the levels are shifted
by the same amount (full line). As a speciﬁc example,
with a FORT detuned by 5 nm we have η ≈ 3.6 × 10−7.
Hence, with a typical FORT power of 50 mW, the re-
quired compensating beam power is 20 nW[15].

Note, that the dipole potential created by the compen-
∆HF
sating beam is U ′ (r) = ± 1
δ U (r) for atoms in the
2
upper an lower hyperﬁne level, respectively, and hence
is negligible when compared with the potential of the
FORT. Moreover, the photon scattering rate from the
s ≈ 2γU ′/∆HF ,
compensating beam γ′
which can be also written as ~γ′
δ U (r) ≈ ~γs. Hence,
the scattering rate from the nearly resonant compensat-
ing beam, is of similar magnitude to that of the far-of-
resonance trapping beam, γs.

s is given by ~γ′

s ≈ γ

We implement the proposed scheme with a FORT
(a red-detuned gaussian beam [3]), created by focusing
a 50 mW laser, detuned 5 nm below resonance, to a
waist of W0 = 50µm, resulting in a potential depth of
U0 ≈ 200Erec (Erec is the recoil energy) and oscillation
frequencies of νr = 2.3 × 103 Hz and νz = 13 Hz in the
radial and axial directions, respectively. An additional
laser, with frequency locked close to the middle of the
ground state hyperﬁne splitting, is combined with the
FORT laser. To achieve optimal spatial mode-match,
both lasers are coupled into a polarization-conserving
single-mode optical ﬁber, and the ﬁber’s output is passed
through a polarizer and focused into the vacuum cham-
ber. Two servo loops are used to control and stabilize the

the trap laser. More importantly, for complete compen-
sation of the relative ac Sark shifts, a second servo loop
ensures a 0.1% stability of the power ratio η throughout
the entire duration of the experiment[16].

The loading procedure is similar to that described in
[17]. Brieﬂy, the FORT is loaded by overlapping it with
a compressed 85Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT). The
MOT beams are shut oﬀ after 650 ms of loading, 50 ms
of compression, and 5 ms of polarization gradient cooling,
leaving ∼ 105 conﬁned atoms with a temperature of ∼
10µK.

We perform a Rabi spectroscopy measurement on
the
trapped atoms by driving the ground state
|F = 2, mF = 0i → |F = 3, mF = 0i transition, which
is insensitive to magnetic ﬁelds, to the ﬁrst order. A
bias magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 80mG is applied parallel to the
FORT’s polarization axis and to the rf magnetic ﬁeld
direction, in order to Zeeman shift the magnetic sensi-
tive mF 6= 0 levels out of resonance with the rf pulse.

lowing the rf pulse, N3 (the population in the |F = 3i
level) is measured by detecting the ﬂuorescence during
a short pulse of a laser beam resonant with the cy-
cling transition

Figure 2 shows results for the Rabi spectrum with a 3
ms long π pulse. A constant background resulting from
spontaneous Raman scattering [19] is substracted. The
spectrum of free-falling atoms shows no inhomogeneous
broadening and a rms width, σ, which is Fourier limited
to 110Hz. A shift in the peak frequency (−756Hz), and
a broadening of the line (to σ = 320Hz) are seen in
the spectrum of trapped atoms, in fair agreement with
the calculated trap depth and atomic temperature. This
inhomogeneous broadening is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected
by the duration of the pulse [12]. The addition of the
weak compensating beam, nearly cancels the broadening
of the spectrum, as well as its shift from the free-atom
line center.

power, again for a 3 ms rf pulse. The spectrum width is
minimized to the Fourier broadening limit at a compen-
sating beam power which corresponds also to a minimal
shift from the free-atoms line center.

Figure 4 shows the measured rf spectrum for a 25 ms
long pulse. A measurement of free atoms with this pulse
length is not possible in our setup since the atoms fall due
to gravity, and leave the interaction region. A Fourier
limited σ = 13Hz is measured, representing a 25-fold re-
duction in the line broadening, as compared to the line
broadening of trapped atoms. We performed a similar
measurement with a 50 ms pulse, and observed a nearly
Fourier limited width (a 50-fold narrowing), at the ex-
pense of a much larger spontaneous photon scattering
and hence a smaller signal[20]. For even larger measure-
ment times spontaneous photon scattering prevents fur-
ther narrowing of the line.

We measure the spin relaxation rate[17, 19] to be ∼
3×10−3s−1 for atoms trapped in the FORT. The addition
of the compensating beam induces an increase of only
∼ 20%.

In summary, we perform an rf spectroscopy measure-
ment of the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state of op-
tically trapped atoms. We demonstrate a novel scheme
for eliminating the trap-induced inhomogeneous broaden-
ing of the transition, by adding a weak ”compensating”
laser, spatially mode-matched with the trapping laser
and with a proper detuning and intensity. Despite being
tuned close to resonance, this laser induces a negligible
change in the dipole potential, and does not considerably
increase the spontaneous scattering rate. With the sup-
pression of inhomogeneous broadening, the atomic coher-
ence time is now limited by the much smaller spontaneous
scattering time.

Whereas in a conventional optical trap the ac Stark
shift of the line center strongly depends on the tem-
perature of the atoms, which may drift considerably, in
the compensated trap the suppression of the line shift is

4

equally eﬀective for all temperatures. Hence, it provides
a mean of achieving a higher stability of the line cen-
ter than that achieved by simply stabilizing the trapping
laser detuning and intensity. For relative spectroscopic
measurements, such as the proposed measurement of the
electron’s permanent electric dipole moment (EDM)[21],
only stability (and not absolute accuracy) of the line cen-
ter is of importance. For example, for a 10 µK deep
YAG-laser trap, and a compensating beam with a 15 KHz
(time averaged) frequency stability, locking the relative
intensity between both beams to a 1 : 10−5 stability, will
result in ∼ 10−14 stability of the rf line center.

Finally, a weak compensating beam, spatially mode-
matched with the trapping beam and properly tuned near
resonance between the upper level of a laser cooling tran-
sition and another excited level, can suppress spatially
dependent frequency shifts of the cooling transition, and
allow simultaneous trapping and cooling with more ﬂex-
ibility than the single frequency method of Ref. [11].

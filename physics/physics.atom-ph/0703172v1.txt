We have studied the resonance ﬂuorescence of a room-temperature rubidium vapor exited to
the atomic 5P3/2 state (D2 line) by powerful single-frequency cw laser radiation (1.25 W/cm2) in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. In these studies, the slow, linear scanning of the laser frequency
across the hyperﬁne transitions of the D2 line is combined with a fast linear scanning of the applied
magnetic ﬁeld, which allows us to record frequency-dependent Hanle resonances from all the groups
of hyperﬁne transitions including V- and Λ - type systems. Rate equations were used to simulate
ﬂuorescence signals for 85Rb due to circularly polarized exciting laser radiation with diﬀerent mean
frequency values and laser intensity values. The simulation show a dependance of the ﬂuorescence
on the magnetic ﬁeld. The Doppler eﬀect was taken into account by averaging the calculated signals
over diﬀerent velocity groups. Theoretical calculations give a width of the signal peak in good
agreement with experiment.

INTRODUCTION

Sustained interest in resonant magneto-optical eﬀects
in atomic vapors is due to their importance to fundamen-
tal physics but also to possibility of using these eﬀects in
numerous applications (see
[1, 2, 3, 4] and references
therein). Besides the obvious dependence on the applied
magnetic ﬁeld, the resonant nature of these eﬀects im-
plies a substantial dependence on the laser frequency.
Meanwhile, as a rule, only one or two of these param-
eters is varied in a given experimental measurement. In
the present work, we report the results of an investiga-
tion of the nonlinear Hanle eﬀect [5, 6] where both the
laser frequency and the magnetic ﬁeld were scanned con-
tinuously and simultaneously at diﬀerent sequence rates
[7]. This technique enables us to acquire additional infor-
mation in one measurement sequence , and can help to
better understand and model the processes under study.
This technique can be applied to other magneto-optical
eﬀects as well [8].

Usually, models of nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects
are based on the optical Bloch equations [9]. At the
same time, as was shown in [10], simpler rate equations
for Zeeman coherences for stationary or quasi-stationary
excitation are equivalent to the optical Bloch equations.
The model based on the rate equations was successfully
applied to studies of atomic interactions with laser radia-
tion in cells in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld
[5, 6, 11].

The elaboration of a realistic model of the interaction
of alkali atoms with laser radiation is complicated by
the fact that the ﬁne structure levels of a typical alkali
atom consists of several hyperﬁne structure (HFS) levels
that in experiments in cells can be only partially resolved
spectroscopically due to Doppler broadening. If an ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the situation becomes

even more complicated. The magnetic ﬁeld mixes to-
gether magnetic sublevels with the same magnetic quan-
tum number M , but belonging to diﬀerent hyperﬁne
states. This mixing can be quite strong, as was shown ex-
perimentally and conﬁrmed in a model for Rb atoms [12]
conﬁned in an extremely thin cell [13]. In that study the
extremely thin cell allowed to resolve spectroscopically
transitions between speciﬁc magnetic sublevels. When
scanning the laser frequency there appeared in a ﬂuores-
cence excitation spectrum transitions that would not be
allowed in the absence of the level mixing due to magnetic
ﬁeld.

In the present study we propose to show that in the
model of the nonlinear Hanle eﬀect we have for the
ﬁrst time accounted simultaneously for all these eﬀects,
namely, the creation of Zeeman coherences between mag-
netic sublevels in the ground and excited states, the mix-
ing of the diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels in the magnetic ﬁeld
(partial decoupling of the electronic angular momentum
of the electrons from the nuclear spin), and the Doppler
eﬀect in the manifold of magnetic sublevels of all hyper-
ﬁne levels of the ﬁne structure states involved.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental details

A schematic drawing of the experimental setup is
shown in Fig. 1. A radiation beam from the solitary
laser diode (SanyoTM DL-7140-201 W) was directed into
the 1 cm-long glass cell containing natural rubidium. The
temperature of the cell was Tcell = 24 C (NRb = 8.6×109
cm−3). The measured output power was 45 mW at the
Rb D2 line, the spectral linewidth was ∼ 15 MHz, and
the laser beam diameter was 1.5 mm. The cell was placed

in 3 mutually orthogonal pairs of Helmholtz coils with-
out metal shielding, which reduced the dc magnetic ﬁeld
to ∼ 10 mG and could apply a magnetic ﬁeld of up to
80 G in a chosen direction. The resonant ﬂuorescence
emerging from the cell was detected by a photodiode
placed at an angle of 90 degrees to the laser beam, 14 cm
from the cell. The detection solid angle was 0.004 srad.
The total intensity of the laser induced ﬂuorescence was
measured without spectral or polarization selection. It
was possible to simultaneously record also the transmit-
ted signal and the saturated absorption signal (branched
to an auxiliary setup, as shown in Fig. 1). Control of
the diode laser injection current and hence, the radia-
tion frequency, as well as data acquisition were done by
means of virtual function generator and a multi-channel
oscilloscope, with the help of a National InstrumentsTM
DAQ board installed in the PC. The software was writ-
ten in LabVIEWT M . The measurements were per-
formed by linearly scanning the laser frequency over a
6 GHz range around the Rb D2 line, covering the 87Rb
Fg = 2 → Fe = 1, 2, 3, 85Rb Fg = 3 → Fe = 2, 3, 4,
and 85Rb Fg = 2 → Fe = 1, 2, 3 Doppler-broadened and
partially overlapping transitions. The typical duration
of a one-way scan was 5 s. Within this time period, the
magnetic ﬁeld is periodically scanned by 120 triangular
bipolar pulses, each with a duration of of 41.5 ms. The
number of measurement points per frequency scan was
50000 (over 400 points per magnetic ﬁeld scan). The ﬂu-
orescence measurement in one scanning point takes 100
µs. This measurement time interval is suﬃciently large
to allow good signal resolution and the development of a
steady state interaction regime. The mutual orientation
of the laser radiation, its polarization, and the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Fig.2.

B. Experimental Results

Figure 3 show the double-scanning ﬂuorescence ex-
citation spectra for the circularly polarized excitation
recorded with laser intensity IL = 1.25 W/cm2. We
can clearly see ﬂuorescence coming from the excitation
of 87Rb atoms in the ground state level Fg = 2, as well
as ﬂuorescence coming from the excitation of 85Rb atoms
in the ground state levels Fg = 3 and Fg = 2. Vertical
lines in the graph show frequencies of atomic transitions
for atoms at rest. For example, line ”3 − 4” shows the
position of the transition Fg = 3 → Fe = 4 for 85Rb
atoms. In this ﬁgure it can be seen that the structure
of the nonlinear Hanle signal depends on ground state
HFS level from which it was excited. The Hanle signals
for excitation from the 87Rb Fg = 2 and from the 85Rb
Fg = 3 levels exhibit sharp, high-contrast peaks in the
vicinity of zero magnetic ﬁeld. The inset in Fig. 3 shows
the dependance of the ﬂuorescence on the magnetic ﬁeld
in the vicinity of these peaks. The width of these high-
contrast peaks is about 2 G. In contrast, the ﬂuorescence
excited from the ground state HFS level Fg = 2 of 85Rb
exhibits dips in the vicinity of zero magnetic ﬁeld of ap-
proximately the same width as the previously discussed

peaks. For each of the three Doppler-overlapped groups
of the three HFS transitions, sub-Doppler dips appear at
high laser intensity, located at the frequency positions of
the two crossover resonances linked by the cycling transi-
tions. As was shown (but not comprehensively explained)
in [14], these dips arise even if precautions are taken to
eliminate the backward-reﬂected beam from the cell, as
was done also in this work.

Similar spectra to the double-scanning ﬂuorescence ex-
citation spectra depicted in Fig. 3 were taken in the laser
intensity range from 70 mW/cm2 up to 1.25 W/cm2.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

A. Outline of the model

In order to build a model of the nonlinear Hanle eﬀect
in Rb atoms in a cell, we will explore the concept of the
density matrix of an atomic ensemble. The diagonal el-
ements of the density matrix ρii of an atomic ensemble
describe the population of a certain atomic level i, and
the non-diagonal elements ρij describe coherences cre-
ated between the levels i and j. In our particular case the
level in question are magnetic sublevels of a certain HFS
level. If atoms are excited from the ground state HFS
level g to the excited state HFS level e, then the density
matrix consists of elements ρgigj and ρeiej , called Zee-
man coherences, as well as ”cross-elements” ρgiej , called
optical coherences.

The optical Bloch equations (OBEs) can be written as

[9]:

ε(t) = |εω| e

−iΦ(t)−i(ω−kωv)t,

3

(3)

where ω is the center frequency of the spectrum and Φ (t)
is the ﬂuctuating phase, which gives the spectrum a ﬁnite
bandwidth △ω. In this model the line shape of the excit-
ing light is Lorentzian with line-width △ω. The atoms
move with a deﬁnite velocity v, which causes the shift
ω − kωv in the laser frequency due to the Doppler eﬀect,
where kω is the wave vector of the excitation light.

The dipole matrix element that couples the i sublevel
with the j sublevel can be written as: dij = hi|d · e|ji. In
the external magnetic ﬁeld, sublevels are mixed so that
each sublevel i with magnetic quantum number M and
and other quantum numbers labeled as ξ is mixture of
diﬀerent hyperﬁne states |F M i with mixing coeﬃcients
Ci,F,M :

|ii = |ξ M i =

Ci,F,M |F M i

(4)

XF

The mixing coeﬃcients Ci,F,M are obtained as the eigen-
vectors of the Hamiltonian matrix of a ﬁne structure state
in the external magnetic ﬁeld.

The dipole transition matrix elements hFkMk|d ·
e|FlMli should be expanded further using angular mo-
mentum algebra, including the Wigner – Eckart theorem
and the fact that the dipole operator acts only on the
electronic part of the hyperﬁne state, which consists of
electronic and nuclear angular momentum (see, for ex-
ample, [15]).

The rate equations for Zeeman coherences are devel-
oped by applying the rotating wave approximation to
the optical Bloch equations, using an adiabatic elimina-
tion procedure for the optical coherences[9], and then
accounting realistically for the ﬂuctuating laser radia-
tion by taking statistical averages over the ﬂuctuating
light ﬁeld phase ( the decorrelation approximation), and
assuming a speciﬁc phase ﬂuctuation model – random
phase jumps or continuous random phase diﬀusion. As a
result we arrive at the rate equations for Zeeman coher-
ences for the ground and excited state sublevels of atoms
[10]. In applying this approach to a case in which atoms
are excited only in the ﬁnite region corresponding to the
laser beam diameter we have to take into account transit
relaxation. Then we obtain the following result:

into the interaction region can be estimated as 1/(2πτ ),
where τ is time in which atom crosses the laser beam due

We look at quasi stationary excitation conditions so
that ∂ρgigj /∂t = ∂ρeiej /∂t = 0.
In (5) the ﬁrst term
on the right-hand-side of the equation describes the de-
struction of the ground state Zeeman coherences due to
magnetic sublevel splitting in an external magnetic ﬁeld.
The second term characterizes the destruction of ground
state density matrix due to transit relaxation. The next
term shows the transfer of population and coherences
from the excited state to the ground state due to spon-
taneous transitions. The fourth term describes how the
population of ”fresh atoms” is supplied to the initial state
from the regions outside of the laser beam in a process of
transit relaxation. The ﬁfth term shows the inﬂuence of
the induced transitions to the ground state density ma-
trix. And ﬁnally, the last term describes the change of

the ground state density matrix in the process of light
absorption.

The terms in the equations for the excited state density
matrix, Eq. (6), can be described in a similar way. The
ﬁrst term shows the destruction of Zeeman coherences
by the external magnetic ﬁeld. The second term shows
transit relaxation. The third term is responsible for the
spontaneous decay of the state. The fourth term shows
light absorption, and the last term describes the inﬂuence
of the induced transitions on the density matrix of the
excited state.

For a multilevel system interacting with laser radia-
tion, we can deﬁne the eﬀective Rabi frequency in the
|εω|
form Ω =
~ hJek d kJgi, where Je is the angular mo-
mentum of the excited state ﬁne structure level and Jg
is the angular momentum of the ground state ﬁne struc-
ture level. The inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld appears
directly in the magnetic sublevel splitting ωij and indi-
rectly in the mixing coeﬃcients Ci,Fk,Mi and Cj,Fl,Mj of
the dipole matrix elements dij .

By solving the rate equations as an algebraic system
of linear equations for ρgigj and ρeiej we get the den-
sity matrix of the excited state. This matrix allows us
to obtain immediately the intensity of the ﬂuorescence
characterized by the polarization vector ˜e [15]:

I(˜e) = ˜I0

where ˜I0 is a proportionality coeﬃcient. The dipole
transition matrix elements d(ob)
eifj = hei|d · ˜e|fji charac-
terize the dipole transition from the excited state ei to
some ﬁnal state fj for the transition on which the ﬂuo-
rescence is observed.

When we want to get the formula for the ﬂuorescence
which is produced by an ensemble of atoms, we have to
average the previously written expression for the ﬂuo-
rescence over the Doppler proﬁle I(˜e) = I(˜e, kωv, B),
taking into account diﬀerent velocity groups kωv. If the
total ﬂuorescence without discrimination of the polar-
ization or frequency is recorded, one needs to sum the
ﬂuorescence over all the polarization components and all
possible ﬁnal state HFS levels.

C. Theoretical results

Our model was used to analyze experimental data ob-
tained for atoms excited with circularly polarized light
at a geometry shown in Fig. 2.

In the experiment, atoms are excited at the resonance
D2 line on the ﬁne structure transition 5S1/2 ←→ 5P3/2.
The ﬁne structure states are split and form the manifold
of hyperﬁne levels corresponding to nuclear spin I = 5/2
and 3/2 for 85Rb and 87Rb respectively. The hyperﬁne
constants for these levels can be found in [16]. In the sig-
nal simulation, the following numerical values of the pa-
rameters related to the experiment conditions were used:
Γ = 6 MHz, γ = 0.01 MHz, ∆ω = 15 MHz, ∆νD = 500
MHz. We found that the model reproduces the mea-
sured signals reasonably well for all frequencies of the
excitation laser including excitation rather far from the
maximal absorption frequency.

The total intensity of the ﬂuorescence was simulated
without selecting the frequency or polarization, as was
done in the measurement. For the theoretical simulation
we also assume that the laser frequency does not change
signiﬁcantly during one magnetic ﬁeld scan.

In the calculation we found that the Rabi frequency
Ω = 250 MHz gives the best ﬁt of experimental mea-
surements obtained at the laser light intensity W = 1250
mW/cm2.

The ﬁrst set of data we analyzed was the dependance of
the ﬂuorescence intensity on the external magnetic ﬁeld
B strength for diﬀerent excitation laser frequencies ¯ω. In
Fig. 4 the dependance of the experimental and simu-
lated ﬂuorescence signal on the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is plotted for diﬀerent laser frequencies in the region of
excitation from the Fg=3 hyperﬁne level of 85Rb (see
In case (a) it was assumed that the laser fre-
Fig.3).
quency ¯ω corresponds to the frequency ω34 of the HFS
cycling transition Fg = 3 → Fe = 4 of an atom at rest
when there is no magnetic ﬁeld. In case (b) ¯ω = ω34 −625
MHz, which corresponds to the laser frequency to the left
of the main peak of the ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum
(see Fig. 3). In case (c) ¯ω = ω34 + 390 MHz, which cor-
responds to the laser frequency to the right of the main
ﬂuorescence peak.

The second set of the data we analyzed (see Fig. 5) was
dependance of the ﬂuorescence on the external magnetic

5

ﬁeld B when we are observing the excitation from the
85Rb ground state hyperﬁne level Fg = 2 (see Fig. 3).
In case (a) the laser frequency was ¯ω = ω34 + 2646 MHz,
for case(b) it was ¯ω = ω34 + 2793 MHz, and for case (c)
¯ω = ω34 + 2935 MHz.

The third set of data we analyzed was the dependance
of the ﬂuorescence on the external magnetic ﬁeld B for
diﬀerent laser light intensities. We chose to use a B-ﬁeld
scan that corresponded to the laser frequency ¯ω = ω34.
Since the intensity of the laser light should be propor-
tional to Ω2 (see, for example, [17]), and since it was
found from our simulation that for I = 1250 mW/cm2,
the corresponding value of the Rabi frequency is Ω = 250
MHz, it can be expected that for the laser intensities
I = 900, 330,and 70 mW/cm2, which were also used in
the experiment, the values of the corresponding Rabi fre-
quencies should be Ω = 215, 130, and 60 MHz, respec-
tively. The results of the comparison of the measured
signals with the simulated curves are presented in Fig.
6.

IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

In our theoretical simulations as well as in the exper-
imental results, we see qualitatively diﬀerent changes in
the ﬂuorescence intensity for diﬀerent excitation frequen-
cies when the magnetic ﬁeld is scanned. For some excita-
tion frequencies the peaks in the vicinity of zero magnetic
ﬁeld are observed, while for other excitation frequencies
dips are observed instead. In particular, in the case when
excitation occurs from the ground state HFS level Fg = 3
of 85Rb(see Fig. 4), we see a peak at B = 0. This dip
is called a bright resonance. It typically occurs when the
excitation scheme Fg → Fe = Fg + 1 is executed. A
detailed explanation of the mechanisms that lead to the
formation of bright resonances is given in [5, 18, 19].

To use this mechanism to explain the peaks in the sig-
nals simulated and measured for excitation of 85Rb atoms
from the Fg = 3 and 87Rb atoms from the Fg = 2 ground
state HFS levels we have to demonstrate that the respec-
tive transitions Fg = 3 → Fe = 4 and Fg = 2 → Fe = 3
give the main contribution to the ﬂuorescence signal.

Let us perform this analysis for the absorption from the
Fg = 3 state to excited state levels Fe = 2, 3, 4 of 85Rb.
In the present experimental conditions, we can spectrally
resolve ground-state HFS levels of Rb and cannot re-
solve excited-state HFS levels. Two points are important
to understand the formation of these bright resonances.
First, for this excitation scheme the laser line-width (15
MHz) is small in comparison to the mean energy sep-
aration (around 100 MHz) between excited state HFS
levels. As a result, we can assume that diﬀerent atoms in

diﬀerent velocity groups interact with laser light indepen-
dently. Besides taking into account the Doppler contour
width (around 500 MHz), we can assume that for a rather
large detuning of the laser frequency from the exact res-
onance of any of the transitions Fg = 3 → Fe = 2, 3, 4,
there still will be atoms in some velocity group that will
be in resonance with the laser excitation as a result of
the Doppler shift.

Secondly, the ground state HFS levels for 85Rb have
quantum numbers Fg = 2, 3. The excited P3/2 state
has HFS levels with quantum numbers Fe = 1, 2, 3, 4.
For the transitions that start from the spectrally re-
solved ground-state level Fg = 3 only the transition
Fg = 3 → Fe = 4 is closed (cycling). This means that
atoms after the absorption of a photon can return only to
the initial ground-state level Fg = 3 and cannot go to the
other ground-state level Fg = 2, which does not interact
with the laser light. The consequence of this situation
is that after several absorption and ﬂuorescence cycles,
all atoms will be optically pumped to the Fg = 2 level,
except atoms with the velocity group that corresponds
to the resonance with closed Fg = 3 → Fe = 4 transi-
tion. This transition exhibits a bright resonance in the
magnetic ﬁeld. This is the reason why in the experiment,
even when the laser radiation is detuned from the exact
Fg = 3 → Fe = 4 resonance to the resonance with open
transitions for the atom at rest, we still observe bright
resonances. This qualitative explanation of the mecha-
nism of resonance formation is supported by the solution
of the exact model.

In the case when excitation occurs for 85Rb from the
ground-state HFS level Fg = 2 (see Fig. 5) we observe
dips in the vicinity of B = 0. This dip is called a dark

7

resonance. It typically occurs when the excitation scheme
is Fg → Fe = Fg − 1[5, 18, 19]. For the excitation from
the ground state HFS level Fg = 2 in 85Rb the only
closed transition is Fg = 2 → Fe = 1. Similar to the
previous case, one can argue that the dark resonances
when atoms are excited from the Fg = 2 in 85Rb should
be attributed to this transition at any laser frequency
within the Doppler proﬁle.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In summary, we can conclude that the double scanning
technique is a powerful tool to study simultaneously fre-
quency and magnetic ﬁeld dependence of nonlinear zero
ﬁeld level-crossing signals, the nonlinear Hanle eﬀect. In
this report we wanted to draw attention to the extended
possibilities oﬀered by this technique. Together with the
improved model of the magneto-optical processes it al-
lows eﬃcient measurements of these signals and provides
a rather detailed theoretical description of the signals
that reproduces experimentally measured signals with
high accuracy.

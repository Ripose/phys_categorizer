It has been proposed that the adiabatic loading of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) into an opti-
cal lattice via the Mott-insulator transition can be used to initialize a quantum computer [D. Jaksch,
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3108 (1998)]. The loading of a BEC into the lattice without causing band
excitation is readily achievable; however, unless one switches on an optical lattice very slowly, the
optical lattice causes a phase to accumulate across the condensate. We show analytically and nu-
merically that a cancellation of this eﬀect is possible by adjusting the harmonic trap force-constant
of the magnetic trap appropriately, thereby facilitating quick loading of an optical lattice for quan-
tum computing purposes. A simple analytical theory is developed for a non-stationary BEC in a
harmonic trap.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Experimental advances in manipulating and controlling Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of dilute atomic gases
has resulted in a remarkable series of experiments [1]. One theoretical proposal for quantum computing using atoms
as qubits is to ﬁrst load the atoms that are in a BEC into an optical lattice. Then, by varying the intensity of a laser
used to form an optical lattice the BEC will undergo a quantum phase transition from its BEC-like superﬂuid state
to a Mott-insulator state [2]. This has recently led to a seminal experiment by Bloch and collaborators [3].

In principle, starting with a BEC in a trap and turning on an optical lattice of suﬃcient well depth in a suﬃciently
adiabatic manner will prepare the Mott-insulator state. In practice, it is easy to turn on the optical lattice adiabatically
with respect to band excitation (excitation from one band to another); however, it is substantially more diﬃcult to
turn on the optical lattice adiabatically with respect to quasi-momentum excitation. The second, more stringent
form of adiabaticity requires that the optical lattice be switched on slowly with respect to mean-ﬁeld interactions and
tunneling dynamics between optical lattice sites, and hence typically requires milliseconds [4]. We will refer to the
ﬁrst form of adiabaticity as ‘interband adiabaticity’ and the second form as ‘intraband adiabaticity’. The intraband
adiabaticity condition has been demonstrated in one-dimensional lattices by Orzel et al. [5] and ultimately led to the
pioneering experimental demonstration of the Mott-insulator transition [3]. When not otherwise speciﬁed, the terms
adiabatic and nonadiabatic in this article will refer to intraband adiabaticity.

The goal of the present paper is to present a simple strategy for remaining in the adiabatic regime while switching
on the optical lattice much faster than the millisecond time scales ordinarily required for intraband adiabaticity. The
strategy is to counterbalance the switching on of the optical lattice with an appropriate change in the force constant
of the trap. This strategy is shown to correct and prevent much of the quasi-momentum excitation and resulting
phase damage that arises from the nonadiabatic nature of the switching.

More speciﬁcally, the switching on of an optical lattice potential can divide a BEC into many individual pieces where
phase coherence is maintained across the whole condensate. This phase coherence can be seen by instantaneously
dropping the lattice and looking at the momentum distribution through time of ﬂight measurements. However,
because of a spatially dependent change in the density and thus the mean-ﬁeld per well site, one can end up with a
quadratic phase dependence developing along the lattice direction if one does not load the lattice adiabatically with
respect to quasi-momentum excitations [4]. Elsewhere [6] it has been shown, using optimal control methods, that
one can control the phase evolution to obtain a ﬂat phase at some ﬁnal time by time varying the harmonic trap
force-constant of a conﬁning external (typically magnetic) trap. Here we show analytically and numerically that a
complete cancellation of the phase development is possible by appropriately adjusting the external trap.

This paper will focus solely on one-dimensional lattices, considering only the dynamics of the BEC along the lattice,
and will ignore eﬀects transverse to the lattice. It should be noted that the eﬀects of transverse excitation will show-up
on time scales inversely proportional to ω
the transverse trapping frequency which is typically long compared to
the times in the present paper. Work is now in progress toward further extending these results to two- and three-

⊥

dimensions. It is expected [7] that the squeezing of the BEC into the transverse directions can also be treated using
the above method, namely by an appropriate adjustment of the trap in those directions.

There have been a number of recent publications of both experimental [8, 9, 10] and theoretical [7, 11] studies
involving the loading of BECs in one-dimensional lattices, and the resulting dynamics. This paper is related to these
publications but focuses explicitly on a means of quickly loading an optical lattice from a BEC for quantum computing
purposes, as well as for improving experimental signal to noise in short time experimental studies of BECs. Note that
we consider the regime where the density of the condensate is suﬃciently large that mean-ﬁeld eﬀects are not entirely
negligible. Experiments can be carried out in the truly dilute gas regime where mean-ﬁeld eﬀects are negligible [10].
However, reducing the condensate density to such low values would have to be carried out adiabatically, adversely
aﬀecting the time to load the optical lattice from the initial (dense) BEC.

The outline of the paper is as follows: in section II we deﬁne the problem. In Sec. III A, a simple analytical theory is
developed for a nonstationary 1D BEC in a harmonic trap. It is shown that a change in the density of the condensate
induces a time-varying phase across the condensate that can be eliminated by a change in the harmonic force constant
of the trap. In section III B it is shown that the eﬀect of switching on the optical lattice is to generate a new eﬀective
normalization of the BEC and an analytical expression is obtained for the modiﬁed harmonic trap force-constant
that compensates for the new eﬀective normalization. The analytical theory is in excellent agreement with numerical
simulations. A modiﬁed version of the theory in the regime where the nonlinear interaction is strong and hence the
the width of the condensate diﬀers from well to well is developed in Sec. III C. Section IV contains the conclusion.

We consider a 1D BEC conﬁned by a harmonic trap and governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation

where ˆK =
∂x2 is the kinetic energy operator, ˆV is the external potential energy operator to be discussed shortly
and N U0 is the nonlinear atom-atom interaction strength, N being the number of atoms and U0 = 4πa0¯h2/m is the
atom-atom interaction strength that is proportional to the s-wave scattering length a0. The BEC is initially in the
ground state of the trap potential and is therefore stationary. An optical lattice is then switched on, having the eﬀect
of separating the BEC wave packet into a series of localized pieces. The potential energy operator therefore takes
the form ˆV (x, t) = 1
t x2 + S(t)V0 cos2(kx), where ωt is the trap frequency - which may be time dependent, k
is the laser ﬁeld wave number, V0 is the lattice intensity and S(t) is the function that switches-on the laser for the
optical lattice and goes from S = 0 at the beginning of the ramp-on of the optical potential to S = 1 at the end
of the switching on time δts. In applications to quantum computing, one often wants to create an optical lattice
with one atom per lattice site which will serve as quantum bits. However, due to the nonlinearity of the equations,
the condensate wave function develops a phase that varies from lattice site to lattice site when the optical lattice
is not turned on adiabatically [4]. Such a wave function can be represented by a superposition of quasi-momentum
states, and a superposition of quasi-momentum corresponds to a higher energy state and thus cannot give rise to the
Mott-insulator state. The problem we address is the elimination of this phase proﬁle by adjusting the trap strength.
In the coming section we analyze the evolution of BEC wave functions in harmonic traps, and consider the eﬀect of
switching on the optical lattice. Finally, a closed form for the precise time dependence of the trap strength that will
insure a ﬂat phase for the wavefunction for all times after the optical potential is fully turned on is derived.

describe the evolution of this wave function in a harmonic trap with trap force-constant K (we ﬁrst consider the case
where K is constant in time, but the equations of motion for w(t), b(t) and c(t) remain valid even if K varies with
time). Inserting the above wave function into the dimensionless NLSE, we obtain, by considering separately the real
and imaginary parts, two equations involving the three parameters w(t), b(t) and c(t). The imaginary part yields

Consider now the potential Ve(w) in (9) plotted as curve (a) in Fig. 1. The potential consists of a well centered
3 . This can be most easily obtained by setting b = 0 and ˙b = 0 in Eq. (6) and
around the stable point w0 ≈
solving for w while noticing that the ﬁrst term on the RHS of (6) is small compared to the rest and can therefore
be neglected. With initial wave function width w(0) = w0, where w0 is the width of the Thomas-Fermi stationary
ground state of the trap, the wave function will remain stationary throughout. However, if the initial width equals
some other value, an oscillatory motion of w round the stationary point w0 will develop. The phase curvature b will
also oscillate with w obtaining its maximum value when w(t) = w0 and vanishing when w approaches its turning
points, w1 and w2.

If an abrupt change in the trap force-constant can be made, K

K ′, at the exact point in time when b(t) = 0,
i.e., when w(t) is at one of its turning points, e.g., w = w1, then it is possible to change the potential so as to freeze
the ﬂat phased wave function and make it stationary. This can be obtained by choosing K ′ = 3U
such that w1 is

the stationary point of the new potential V ′e (curve (b) in Fig. 1).

Another scenario to be considered is the following. We begin with a stationary ﬂat phased wave function residing

normalization of the BEC wave function from unity to n. This would be equivalent to a change in the potential
Ve →
nU . It is obvious that this change will shift the stationary point to some new
value w′0 = ( 3nU
4K )
3 (see curve (c) in Fig. 1) and that the wave function currently positioned at w0 will no longer be
stationary under the new potential. In order to compensate for this change and keep the wave function stationary
one can adjust the trap force-constant and set K ′ = nK such that ratio U/K remains constant and the stationary
point w′0 = w0 will not shift (see curve (d) in Fig. 1).

We show in the following section that turning on an optical lattice corresponds to a change in the normalization
of the wave function, so that the above scenario corresponds precisely to our goal of achieving a ﬂat phased BEC
loading of an optical lattice. It should be noted that the above analysis ignores gravity which can be assumed to be
orthogonal to the lattice direction. However, even if gravity is along the lattice direction a similar analysis holds but
requires an additional linear oﬀset.

B. Switching on the Optical Lattice

Quickly switching on the optical lattice causes the BEC wave function, which initially has a Thomas-Fermi form of
an inverted harmonic potential, to split into a series of localized pieces each residing in a lattice well. As the overall
normalization of the wave function must remain unity, the displaced population from areas between the lattice wells
builds up within the wells such that the density in these regions increases dramatically (see Fig. 2). However, if we
neglect the local lattice structure and consider solely the global nature of the BEC wave function, we see that it
retains its quadratic shape, and the change in the wave function brought about by the existence of the optical lattice
can be viewed as a stretching of the Thomas-Fermi wave function in the vertical direction (see Fig. 2). This picture
is based on a separation of scales in the spatial dimension which is a consequence of the fact that the length of each
lattice well, λ
k , is much smaller than the scale of the total wave packet, w (see for example Ref. [11]). It is for
this reason that we can treat ﬁrst the local structure of the wave function in each well and then consider separately
the overall global evolution of the wave function.

The idea is therefore to view the wave function on a level coarser than the lattice site dimension, averaging out
the local lattice structure of the wave function. This procedure yields a new Thomas-Fermi type wave function
x2

w2 ) diﬀering from the initial one by a modiﬁed normalization factor n (see Fig. 2). The
|
evolution of this wave function can then be analyzed using the results of the previous section.
This procedure can also be viewed as a spatial-averaging out of the local structure of the Hamiltonian operator
iloc. The harmonic trap potential Vt is constant
iloc =
H
h
on the local scale and is therefore unaﬀected by the averaging. If the average kinetic and lattice potential energies
per particle, T av and V av
lattice, are constant from well to well, these contributions to the energy can be absorbed into
the chemical potential µ, resulting in just the averaged global mean-ﬁeld playing-oﬀ, on the global scale, against the
trap potential as in a simple Thomas-Fermi procedure. The trap must then be adjusted to compensate only for the
varying mean-ﬁeld across the BEC wave function.

In obtaining this simpliﬁed picture we distinguish between two opposite scenarios occurring on the local scale. In
many cases, when considering the dynamics along the direction of the one-dimensional lattice, the mean-ﬁeld within
each well is negligible in comparison with the kinetic and potential energies along this direction. This occurs for tight
optical wells, e.g., short wavelength and strong intensity such that √V k2
U/w, where w is the width of the BEC.
The local wave function can then be well approximated by a Gaussian with a “well-independent” width implying
that the locally averaged kinetic and lattice potential energies are also “well-independent”. In carrying out the above
procedure we then ﬁnd that the global wave function is a stretched image of the initial one, as described above.

≫

In the opposite regime the mean-ﬁeld within each well can no longer be neglected. In these cases the calculations
are more involved and do not yield the simpliﬁed picture presented here of a mere stretching of the wave function.
Instead, a distortion occurs which must be treated explicitly. We therefore delay discussion of this scenario and
provide a more general treatment in the next section.

In the following we wish to determine the normalization factor n in terms of the optical lattice parameters V and

Assuming that the local population becomes trapped in the well during the switching on of the optical lattice, we
can then consider the local normalization factor per well as constant throughout the evolution. Assuming too that
the wave function at each lattice site is localized after the optical lattice has been switched on, we can ascribe to each
lattice site a local wave function, φi(x), which is normalized to ηi. In order to obtain an average norm per well we
deﬁne the local probability function Pi(x) which is just the local wave function normalized to unity

Averaging out the local structure using the local probability function, Pi(x), we obtain the coarse-grained wave

Note, the limits of integration in the above integral should be restricted to a single well but due to the gaussian-like

FIG. 3: Evolution of the wave function (amplitude and phase) as a consequence of switching on the optical lattice. Note the
development of a quadratic phase proﬁle.

If the switching-on time δts is short compared to the global nonlinear time scale tN L [13] so as no substantial phase
evolution occurs during this time, the transformation of the normalization constant can be considered abrupt and the
dynamics of the wave function parameters w(t) and b(t) are raised from the initial potential curve Ve to V ′e (curves (a)
nU as described in the previous section. If no further adjustments
and (c) respectively in Fig. 1) by the change U
are made, the wave function will begin to evolve on the potential curve V ′e and develop phase as seen in Fig. 3. In
order to cancel this eﬀect one can compensate for the change of normalization by adjusting the trap force-constant
to K = nK0 (curve (d) of Fig. 1). In Fig. 4 we plot the switching-on function of the optical lattice and the change of
the trap force-constant ∆K = K
K0 as a function of time. The evolution of the wave packet under this sequence
of events is plotted in Fig. 5, from which it is evident that the phase remains constant throughout the evolution for
the correct tuning of the trap force-constant.

C. Nonlinear Regime

We now return to the more complicated scenario where the local wave function has spatially varying contributions
from the mean-ﬁeld term. Various complications arise in this regime which must be solved individually. The main
complication is due to the fact that when the mean-ﬁeld is locally important it aﬀects the width and shape of the
local wave functions such that they diﬀer from well to well as shown in appendix A. This implies that the average
kinetic and lattice potential energies also vary from well to well, aﬀecting the phase accumulation.

Assuming that the local wave function can still be approximated by a Gaussian along the lattice direction (as is
the case unless the local mean-ﬁeld is larger than the kinetic energy) we can use the results of appendix A to obtain
the well-dependent width ∆(xi). This can be inserted back into Eq. (A2) to obtain the total local energy as a sum
of its contributions: the kinetic energy T , the lattice potential energy Elattice, the trap potential energy Et and the
mean-ﬁeld energy Emf . The chemical potential associated with a speciﬁc lattice site is [14]

.

In order to keep the phase evolution constant from well to well one must adjust Vt(xi) such that it cancels all other xi
dependencies (originating in ∆(xi) and η(xi)) and thus makes µ independent of xi. Another complication arises from
the fact that the optical lattice must be switched on adiabatically with respect to interband excitations (as stressed
in the introduction), e.g., the switching-on time δts in our dimensionless units must be longer than 2π
. This means
k√V
that for experiments in which the lattice wavelength is large, the lower bound on the switching-on time becomes
comparable to tN L and considerable phase evolution will occur during this time.

To avoid the phase winding during the switching-on time one must make the trap frequency change gradually so
as to compensate for the changing shape of the wave function at intermediate times. We assume as a zeroth order
approximation that a transition of the magnetic trap from its initial to its ﬁnal form using the same switching-on
function as the optical lattice, will momentarily compensate for the changing shape of the wave function. The relevant

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The switching on of an optical lattice potential can divide a BEC into many individual pieces where phase coherence
is maintained across the whole condensate. However, because of a spatially dependent change in the density and thus
the mean-ﬁeld per well site, one can end up with a quadratic phase dependence developing along the lattice direction
if one does not load the lattice adiabatically. We have shown analytically and numerically that a cancellation of this
eﬀect is possible by appropriately adjusting the external trap. A simple analytical theory has been developed for a non-
stationary 1D BEC in a harmonic trap. It was shown that the eﬀect of switching on the optical lattice is to generate a
new eﬀective normalization of the BEC, and hence a nonstationary condensate. Finally, an analytical expression was
obtained for the modiﬁed harmonic trap force-constant that compensates for the new eﬀective normalization. The
analytical theory is in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

In real experiments more care is needed to account for the eﬀects of evolution in the transverse directions. Work
is now in progress toward extending these results to two and three dimensions. It is expected that the expansion
of the BEC into the transverse directions can also be treated using the above method namely by an appropriate

2 This can be accomplished by changing the conﬁguration of the lasers that make the optical lattice from counter-propagating to inter-

secting at an angle θ such that sin(θ/2) = 1/8 (i.e., θ = 14.36 degrees).

adjustment of the trap in those directions. We have detailed elsewhere how our quasi-1D calculations of the type we
presented here model 3D aspects of the dynamics in cylindrically symmetric potentials [7], but this method can not
describe radial excitations of the BEC that might arise due to the optical potential via the mean-ﬁeld interaction.
To the extent that radial excitations are not important, our method should be an adequate approximation to the 3D
dynamics.

It is not known how a small residual spatially varying phase will aﬀect the Mott-insulator transition. The residual
phase can be thought of as a phonon-like excitation that should be mapped onto the ﬁnal Mott-Insulator state.
Characterizing the nature of excitations in an inhomogeneous Mott-Insulator has not been done; however, the small
residual excitations seen here are not expected to have a strong eﬀect since the total energy of the system is only
slightly above that of the ideal case. A more exact answer to this question can not be provided within the context of
a mean-ﬁeld approach and requires analysis using many-body approaches to the Mott-insulator transition. Moreover,
no theoretical model exists that is completely appropriate in both the superﬂuid and Mott-Insulator regimes.

of width ∆, normalized to the local normalization factor ηi and centered around xi. We wish here, using the variational

We ﬁrst compute the energy associated with φi as a function of ∆:

An explicit solution of this equation for ∆ is not possible in general; we therefore distinguish between several cases
and make some simplifying assumptions. If, as is the case for short optical wavelength, the mean-ﬁeld term becomes
negligible with respect to the other energy terms, it can be neglected to obtain the following equation

It can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2 that this value for the width of the local wave function gives good results. An
important point to note is that in this regime ∆ is independent of the well position, implying that the lattice potential
and kinetic energies per particle too are “well-independent”. This crucial point justiﬁes our treatment of the global
wave function ψglob as a Thomas-Fermi approximation.

For high density BECs and longer optical wavelengths the mean-ﬁeld cannot be neglected and Eq. (A3) must be

dependent”, implying that the kinetic and lattice potential energies per particle will also be “well-dependent” and
thus contribute to the phase curvature accumulation. This must be taken into account when adjusting the trap to
counter the phase accumulation, within the non-negligible mean-ﬁeld regime, as will be discussed in section III C.

(Dated: February 20, 2014)

Certain Hamiltonians based on two coupled quantum mechanical spins exhibit degenerate eigen-
values despite having no obvious symmetries: the corresponding conserved quantities do not appear
to have a simple form when expressed as polynomials of the generators of rotations for the respec-
tive spins. As observed in [1], one such Hamiltonian helps explain resonances in the spin relaxation
rate of optically pumped Rb2, as a function of applied magnetic ﬁeld. For this Hamiltonian and
others closely related to it, we give an explanation why the degeneracies exist, based on an argument
inspired by supersymmetry.

INTRODUCTION

Consider a system composed of two quantum mechan-
ical spins, one of them spin k and the other spin s, where
we assume s
k. The angular momenta for the spins are
~K = (Kx, Ky, Kz) and ~S = (Sx, Sy, Sz), where the com-
ponents are Hermitian operators acting, respectively, on
the (2k + 1)-dimensional or (2s + 1)-dimensional Hilbert
spaces for spin k or spin s. The Hamiltonian

≤

H(q) = ~K

~S + 1/2 + qSz

has, for q
= 0, no obvious symmetries other than rota-
tional symmetry around the z-axis. More precisely, H(q)
commutes with Jz, where ~J = ~K + ~S is the total angular
momentum, but there is no other obvious combination of
the components of ~K and ~S with which H(q) commutes.
Yet, for s = 1 and any k, a glance at the spectrum of
H(q) as a function of q reveals a (2k + 1)-fold degeneracy
at zero energy when q = k + 1/2: see ﬁgure 1. (We set
~ = 1 throughout).

The degeneracies of H(0) are of course due to the en-
hanced rotational symmetry: without the last term in
(1), H(q) commutes also with Jx and Jy, so the eigen-
vectors organize into multiplets of the total SU (2) alge-
bra generated by ~J, with H(q) acting as a multiple of
the identity within each multiplet. Non-abelian symme-
try is indeed the usual way of explaining degeneracies in
simple quantum mechanical systems. Despite some ef-
fort [2, 3, 4, 5], simple expressions for the generators of a
non-abelian symmetry group commuting with H(k+1/2)
have not come to light.

In [1], the Hamiltonian (1), augmented by a spin-axis

interaction, was used to describe the dynamics of the to-
tal nuclear spin ~K and the total electronic spin ~S of Rb2
molecules in an electronic spin triplet state, subjected
to a magnetic ﬁeld. Resonances were observed in the
spin relaxation rate, as a function of magnetic ﬁeld, near
the special values of the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to
q = k + 1/2. The exact degeneracy for the Hamilto-
nian (1) was then used to argue that the added spin-axis

interactions are a necessary and important part of spin
relaxation.

The degeneracy of H(k + 1/2) can be demonstrated
through direct calculation. Observe ﬁrst that because
[Jz, H(q)] = 0, H(q) is block diagonal in a basis where
Jz is diagonal; and because s = 1, the blocks are at most

In [4] it was observed that PH OPH commutes with
H(k + 1/2) for any operator O (this fact depends only
on having the image of PH fall in a single eigenspace
of H(k + 1/2)), and based on this observation symme-
try operators were constructed which generate an SU (2)
algebra for which the (2k + 1)-dimensional kernel of
H(k + 1/2) furnishes the spin k representation. The
ﬁnal expression for the generators is somewhat compli-
cated, and its derivation depends crucially on the detailed
knowledge of the spectrum that one can extract from (2).
We therefore seek alternative approaches to under-
standing the mysterious degeneracy of H(k +1/2). What
simple truths make this degeneracy inevitable? Why
is the degeneracy exact only for s = 1? What related
Hamiltonians exhibit similar degeneracies, and why? In
section II, we will give partial answers to the ﬁrst two
of these questions based on crisp answers to the third.
In section III, we will give some preliminary indications
that some of the special properties for s = 1 extend in
an approximate way to integer s > 1.

The relation between X(q) and H(q) is reminiscent of
the relation between the energy and the supercharge in a

those annihilated by Q and Q†: for any state

closely related to the kernel of H(k + 1/2) when s = 1.

is that the subspaces U and V spanned by

least 2k + 1. If we took k = 0, this would amount roughly
to the familiar statement that two planes in three dimen-
sions intersect at least over a line. Any vector

We conclude that X(q) has a large degenerate
eigenspace (at least (2k + 1)-dimensional) for any value
of q. That eigenspace, constructed as U
V in the previ-
ous paragraph, doesn’t depend on q, but its X(q) eigen-
value does; and that eigenvalue is 0 when q = k + 1/2.
V is exactly 2k + 1. We
In fact, the dimension of U
would regard it as coincidence if it were bigger, just as it
would be a coincidence if two planes chosen at random in
three dimensions happened to be parallel. By the same
arguments, a Hamiltonian constructed as a sum of two
terms which fail to commute and have eigenspaces with
dimensions adding up to r plus the dimension of the total
Hilbert space must itself have an eigenspace with degen-
eracy of at least r—and the generic situation is for the
degeneracy to be precisely r. Generalizing to more than
two terms is straightforward, but then the degeneracies
for the individual terms must be quite large for the total
Hamiltonian to have a degeneracy.

ing with H(

situation is not quite so simple: the highest weight eigen-
vector of Jz, whose eigenvalue is k + 1, is annihilated by
both H(
1/2) and X(k + 1/2). With no further
constraints, genericity suggests that p = 1 and that the
construction explained after (6) gives us 2k of the 2k + 1
degenerate eigenvectors of H(k + 1/2). This is right: the
only exception is the vector annihilated by H(k + 1/2)

if s is a half-integer. To see this, consider a basis in which

Recall from the theory of addition of angular momenta
that the

that within each block, the only non-zero entries are one
step oﬀ the diagonal. The determinant of each block
must therefore vanish when the dimension of the block is
odd: this owes to the fact that there is no permutation
of an odd number of objects that replaces each object by
one of its nearest neighbors. Counting up the number
of odd-dimensional blocks leads us immediately to the
conclusion that the dimension of the kernel of Y is at
least 2k + 1 if 2s + 1 is odd, and at least 2s + 1 if 2s + 1
is even.

In the same basis, with phases chosen so that the ma-

is clearly a similar phenomenon to the exact degeneracy
for s = 1. But H(q) seems altogether more complicated
for s > 1: it has many two-fold degeneracies, seldom if
ever at the same value of q; whereas for s = 1, the only
degeneracies are the large ones at q = 0 and
= k+1/2.
This suggests that some notion of integrability applies to
the s = 1 case but not the s > 1 cases.

with rs chosen to put the approximate degeneracy near
zero eigenvalue: rs = s(s + 1)/4 at least through s =
s eigenvectors with
5. Now Xs(q∗) also has 2k + 1
eigenvalue close to zero. For s = 2, in all but one of the
2k
4 eigenspaces of Jz where Y , X2(q∗), and H2(q∗) all
have nearly a zero eigenvector, these three eigenvectors
are almost linearly dependent—to within a few percent
for k = 6 and 7. And for s = 3, acting with H(
q∗)
upon the 2k + 1 eigenvectors of X3(q∗) with the smallest
eigenvalues leads almost to 2k
3 of the nearly degenerate
eigenvectors of H3(q∗)—to an accuracy such that the dot
product between unit vectors, one chosen arbitrarily from
the second, smaller set and the other chosen carefully
from the ﬁrst, is always between 0.9 and 0.95, for k = 7
and 8. This last observation is particularly striking: the
construction we gave following (6) almost works, even
though the zero eigenvectors of Y are far from the nearly
degenerate eigenvectors of X3(q∗).

−

Of course, the ideal would be to ﬁnd some perturba-
tion of Hs(q) that has an exact degeneracy. Then the ap-
proximate degeneracy might be understood via ﬁrst order
perturbation theory. An elementary example of how this
can work is furnished by H(q, p) = ~K
~S + qSz + pKz,
which for q and p small has (2j + 1)-fold approximate
degeneracies among eigenvectors which nearly have total
angular momentum j, provided (in the terminology of

the Wigner-Eckart theorem) the reduced matrix element
of q ~S + p ~K vanishes: that is, q[j(j + 1) + s(s + 1)
k(k +

s(s + 1)] = 0.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have advanced general arguments which account
for the large degeneracy of eigenvalues of the Hamil-
tonian H(k + 1/2) for s = 1. The key idea, inspired
by supersymmetry, was to relate the kernel of the anti-
commutator of two operators to the kernels of the in-
dividual operators. Strictly speaking, our construction
guarantees only a (k + 1/2)-fold degeneracy; but gener-
icity arguments, hinging on the notion that eigenspaces
of two non-commuting operators will typically have no
overlap, lead us to expect 2k + 1 degenerate eigenstates
of H(k + 1/2), which is right. A subtlety explained in the
two paragraphs following (6) prevents us from construct-
ing just one of the degenerate eigenvalues of H(k + 1/2)
in an obvious way.

In the process of formulating these general arguments,
we have noted a large class of Hamiltonians with large de-
generacies but no obvious symmetries, namely ones which
can be written as a sum of terms, each with a large de-
generacy, which don’t commute with one another. We
have also noted a special operator, Y = KxSy
KySx,
which has a large kernel for any k and s.

−

The observations that our construction of the zero
eigenvalues of H(k + 1/2) extends to an approximate
treatment for s = 3, and that for s = 2 there is a
wholly diﬀerent but non-trivial relationship among the
eigenspaces of H2(q∗) and the ancillary commutator and
anti-commutator operators, suggest that much more re-
mains to be learned about this class of Hamiltonians.

[7] For half-integer s, no such degeneracy appears:

in fact,
eigenvalues of H(q) never cluster close to zero, heuristi-
cally because half-integer s means that ~S cannot be nearly
orthogonal to any given vector—in particular, to ~K − qˆz.

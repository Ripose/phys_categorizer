We have performed sub-Doppler spectroscopy on the narrow intercombination line of cold calcium
atoms using the ampliﬁed output of a femtosecond laser frequency comb. Injection locking of a 657-
nm diode laser with a femtosecond comb allows for two regimes of ampliﬁcation, one in which
many lines of the comb are ampliﬁed, and one where a single line is predominantly ampliﬁed.
The output of the laser in both regimes was used to perform kilohertz-level spectroscopy. This
experiment demonstrates the potential for high-resolution absolute-frequency spectroscopy over the
entire spectrum of the frequency comb output using a single high-ﬁnesse optical reference cavity.

The coherent optical bandwidth provided from fre-
quency combs based on modelocked femtosecond lasers
provide the optical-to-microwave division necessary to di-
rectly count optical frequencies, which has lead to signif-
icant advances in optical frequency measurement [1, 2].
With the development of ultra-broadband titanium-
doped sapphire (Ti:S) lasers [3, 4, 5] and the coherent
broadening possible with nonlinear optical ﬁbers,[6] the
optical bandwidth of comb generators extends from near
infrared into visible frequencies. The subsequent stabi-
lization of such frequency combs allows for absolute op-
tical measurements over hundreds of terahertz making
them an ideal tool for spectroscopy. Already, frequency
combs have been used for direct spectroscopy of allowed
two-photon and one-photon transitions [7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12]. Previous measurements with the direct output of
a frequency comb have been performed by stabilization
of the comb to microwave references and studying tran-
sitions with megahertz linewidths. A greater potential
can be realized by transferring the stability of a narrow
optical reference to the comb.

A new paradigm is attained by combining the ex-
tremely precise optical synthesis of the comb with cold
atomic samples that allow long interaction times and
permit for nonlinear spectroscopy of very narrow optical
transitions with low optical powers. Here we work with a
forbidden intercombination transition in cold neutral cal-
cium (Ca) and resolve features as narrow as 1.2 kHz. In
order compensate for the relatively high residual temper-
atures of our atoms,we amplifying the teeth centered at
the transition wavelength in a laser diode [14]. Addition-
ally, we demonstrate the comb’s wavelength versatility
by stabilizing the comb relative to a high-ﬁnesse cavity
at 534 nm, but perform high-resolution spectroscopy at
657 nm. The application of direct optical measurements
with an optical frequency comb to optical clocks that rely
on both very cold atoms and optical frequency combs.
Direct spectroscopy with an optical comb could poten-
tially yield access to transition frequencies that would be
diﬃcult to reach otherwise.

The laser that is used in the experiments is a ring cav-

FIG. 1: Experimental depiction for high-precision optical
spectroscopy of cold Ca atoms using a femtosecond laser fre-
quency comb. Acousto-optic modulators (AOM) switch light
between two optical ﬁbers that deliver counter-propagating
pulses to the Ca magneto-optical trap (MOT). An f -to-2f
self-referencing technique allows phase stabilization of the
laser oﬀset frequency, f0. Phase stabilization of the laser rep-
etition rate, frep, is obtained by phase locking the comb to
a ﬁber laser at 1068 nm that is stabilized to a high-ﬁnesse
optical cavity. Measurement of the laser repetition rate ver-
sus a hydrogen-maser permits for frequency calibration in the
measurements.

ity modelocked femtosecond laser based on Ti:S, with a
repetition rate around 1 GHz [15]. The laser produces an
optical spectrum with rigorously spaced and coherently
related optical frequency components that are character-
ized by two rf frequencies. The ﬁrst frequency is the laser
repetition rate, frep, which sets the mode spacing and is
determined by the laser cavity length. The second is the
carrier-envelope oﬀset frequency, f0, which deﬁnes the
absolute comb position and is determined by dispersion

in the laser cavity [1]. The laser spectrum is composed
of more than 105 optical frequencies, νn, each of which is
described absolutely by the equation, νn = n × frep + f0,
where n is the mode number (∼ 105) that multiplies frep
up from microwave into optical frequencies. The laser oﬀ-
set frequency is stabilized using a standard f -to-2f inter-
ferometer, which uses a self-referencing technique [2] that
compares frequency-doubled comb lines on the low fre-
quency end of the comb to fundamental light on the high
frequency end of the comb (Fig. 1). Stabilization of f0
is obtained by modulation of the Ti:S pump laser power
(solid state pump source at 532 nm) via an acousto-optic
modulator. The octave bandwidth necessary for stabi-
lization of f0 is obtained via intra-cavity continuum gen-
eration in the Ti:S crystal [15]. The resulting power per
mode of the Ti:S laser spectrum is suﬃcient for both sta-
bilization of the comb and and for spectroscopy at 657
nm without additional broadening in nonlinear ﬁbers.

To use the modelocked laser as the local oscillator for
high precision spectroscopy requires narrow optical comb
lines. To this end, the frequency of one mode of the comb
is stabilized to a ﬁber laser at 1068 nm. Part of this ﬁber
laser output is frequency doubled and referenced to an
optical cavity at 534 nm with a ﬁnesse of 16,000 and a
drift rate of less than 1 Hz/s [16]. Because the optical
cavity is located in a diﬀerent part of the building, a 300
m long optical ﬁber delivers the light from the cavity-
stabilized ﬁber laser to the femtosecond laser frequency
comb. The ﬁber length ﬂuctuations are Doppler-canceled
using standard techniques [17]. We obtain a heterodyne
beat signal between the comb and the ﬁber laser with
a signal to noise ratio of ∼ 40 dB in a 300 kHz resolu-
tion bandwidth. This radio frequency heterodyne beat
is phase locked to a synthesized reference frequency via
feedback to a piezoelectric actuator that adjusts the laser
cavity length. To perform spectroscopy, we scan the syn-
thesized reference and hence the optical lines of the comb.
With both the frequency of a single mode and the oﬀset
frequency stabilized, we obtain an optical linewidth of
∼ 3 Hz for every comb line spanning the entire spectrum
of the laser [15]. Delivery of the comb light to the Ca
experiment via a 20-m long polarization maintaining op-
tical ﬁber without Doppler noise cancelation results in a
degradation of the optical linewidth to several hundred
Hertz. Noise cancelation on the ﬁber is imperative for
achieving sub-kilohertz resolution measurements.

We use the stabilized comb to study the narrow 657-nm
inter-combination line of the Ca atomic clock developed
at NIST [18]. The one-photon transition between the
4s2 1S0 (m = 0) and 4s4p 3P1 (m = 0) levels, which is
forbidden in the L-S coupling approximation, has a nar-
row natural linewidth of 374 Hz [19] (see Fig. 2). Using
standard trapping and cooling techniques described in
detail in [18], we obtain a Ca sample with 6 × 107 atoms
cooled to 2 mK in 2 ms. By taking the direct output
of the comb at 657 nm we have approximately 100 nW
per mode. This power is suﬃcient for measurement of
the Doppler proﬁle, but insuﬃcient for saturated ab-

sorption spectroscopy, which permits higher-resolution;
sub-Doppler spectroscopy of the Ca clock transition. For
higher optical powers, we use a similar technique as that
described in Ref. [14] by injecting comb light into an anti-
reﬂection coated 657-nm diode laser. The diode laser is
injected with comb light centered at 657 nm, which is
narrowed to ≃ 0.5 nm using a 2400 grooves/mm diﬀrac-
tion grating and a single-mode optical ﬁber. For a diode
laser current of 65 mA (just above the self-lasing thresh-
old) this arrangement yields a uniform ten-fold optical
ampliﬁcation across of the injected comb light.

The ampliﬁed comb light is delivered to the Ca atoms
via optical ﬁber (Fig. 1) whereby acousto-optic modu-
lators act as switches to control the time duration and
the separation time of the optical pulses delivered to
the atoms (see Fig. 1). Successive counter-propagating
pulses from the comb are delivered to the Ca atoms,
which allows for a Doppler-free saturated absorption on
the optical transition. Typically, we deliver pulses with a
duration of 100 µs and an optical power of ∼ 2.7 µW that
are tuned through the resonance of the 4s2 1S0 → 4s4p
3P1 transition. Excitation of the Ca sample is measured
using a shelving detection scheme [18, 20], whereby ﬂuo-
rescence from the strongly allowed 1S0 →1 P1 transition
(423 nm), measured before and after 657-nm excitation,
reveals the ground state depletion due to excitation to the
3P1 state (see Fig. 2). Figure 3a) shows a measurement of
the sub-Doppler photon recoil splitting of 23 kHz [21, 22]
taken with the optical frequency comb. The right peak
in is the standard saturated absorption peak (located at
the center of the Doppler proﬁle), while the left peak is
due to stimulated emission during the second pulse and is
centered at exactly one photon recoil from the absorption
peak. Note that the atomic resonance should be exactly
half way between the two peaks [22]. Given the natu-
ral linewidth of the transition and the optical linewidth

to greater power broadening (linewidth = 108 kHz), thereby
making the double structure indistinguishable. Each point in

of the comb light we expect a saturation linewidth on
the order of 2 kHz for a 100 µs pulse. The broader ob-
served linewidth of 5.9 kHz, measured from a ﬁt to the
double-structure, results from power broadening of the
transition consistent with the applied optical power.

Figure 3 b) shows the saturation dip when the laser
diode current is increased to 98 mA (i.e. much higher
than the threshold current). At this diode laser current
we observe preferential ampliﬁcation of particular comb
teeth. By careful adjustment of the diode temperature
and current, the comb line resonant with the transition
can be made to contain up to 10 percent of the ampliﬁed
power, yielding ∼ 1000 times ampliﬁcation of that par-
ticular mode. This ampliﬁcation factor is inferred from
the power broadening measured in the data shown in Fig.
3b). We independently conﬁrmed this behavior by het-
erodyning the ampliﬁed comb light against a stable CW
657 nm optical frequency reference. The comb light alone
as measured using a fast photodetector results in an rf
spectrum with harmonics of the comb repetition rate.
The heterodyne beat between the CW laser and the in-
dividual comb lines is observed as sidebands on these rep-
etition rate harmonics. At low diode laser currents, near
65 mA, we observe sidebands with uniform amplitude,
which does not exhibit strong dependance with current
and temperature. However at 98 mA, careful adjustment
of diode laser current allows for enhancement or suppres-
sion of the amplitude of particular sidebands.

FIG. 4: Time-resolved optical Bord´e-Ramsey fringes for pulse
lengths of 7 µs and varying pulse separations of a) 14 µs, b)
104 µs and c) 203 µs. The decrease in the signal to noise ratio
from a) to c) is the result of spontaneous population decay
from the excited state and residual noise on the 657-nm light
(see text for details). Each point in the plots is the result of
150 ms of averaging. The y-axis is oﬀset for convenience and
1 mV corresponds to ∼ 600 atoms.

With 850 µW of ampliﬁed light at the transition wave-
length we have suﬃcient optical power for observation
of Bord´e-Ramsey fringes, allowing for higher resolution
spectroscopy of the Ca clock transition. The technique
consists of applying two π/2 pulses from one direction
(separated by a time T /2) and then two π/2 pulses from
the opposite direction (separated by the same time T /2).
The excitation probability exhibits (on top of a slowly
varying envelope [24]) a sine wave pattern proportional
to sin[π(ν − ν0)/(2 ∆ν)], where ∆ν = 1/2T and ν0 is the
resonant optical frequency [23]. At a diode laser current
of 65 mA the pulse duration necessary for π-pulse would
have exceeded that of the upper state lifetime. Figure 4
shows the fringe contrast obtained for a ﬁxed pulse du-
ration of 7 µs (required for a π/2-pulse with 850 µW of
optical power) with varying pulse separations, T /2. The
relatively long pulse duration due to our limited optical
power, coupled with the broad Doppler width ( 3 MHz)
on the Ca clock transition, allows interaction with only
a very narrow velocity class of atoms. As a result only
3% of the atoms participate in the measurement yield-
ing a low signal to noise ratio (S/N) of ∼ 4 after 150 ms
of averaging for our narrowest linewidth, ∆ν of 1.2 kHz.
Lower residual atoms temperatures and higher conﬁne-

ment would narrow the velocity distribution of the atoms,
resulting in signiﬁcantly higher signal to noise ratios. The
above technique can be used for a high-resolution abso-
lute measurement of the line center since the AC stark
shift due to other comb components should be negligible.
For a completely asymmetric distribution of comb lines
with equal amplitude, we estimate the AC stark shift to
be ¡ 1 mH.

In summary, we have used the ampliﬁed output of
a femtosecond optical frequency comb to demonstrated
kilohertz-level spectroscopy of the 4s4s 1S0 (m = 0) →
4s4p 3P1 (m = 0) transition in a cold sample of atomic
Ca. We observe two ampliﬁcation regimes when inject-
ing a 657-nm diode laser with 0.5 nm of comb light. Near
threshold, uniform ampliﬁcation of the comb light is ob-
served, whereas at much higher diode laser currents, pref-
erential ampliﬁcation results in a hundred-fold increase
in ampliﬁcation at the transition wavelength. With our
relatively high atom temperatures, the greater ampliﬁ-
cation possible with the second regime is necessary for
higher resolution spectroscopy of the Ca clock transition
with Bord´e-Ramsey fringes. Use of an atomic sample
with higher conﬁnement and lower residual temperature,
however, could potentially allow for measurement of nar-
rower transitions with a single unampliﬁed comb line.

The marriage between cold atoms and ultra-stable
combs opens the potential for using a frequency comb
stabilized to a single optical reference and performing
spectroscopy at frequencies diﬃcult to reach otherwise.
One particular example would be to explore neutral Yb
conﬁned in an atomic lattice at NIST [25]. The ex-
tremely high lattice conﬁnement and nanokelvin resid-
ual temperatures will allow for near-unity excitation of
the atoms with a 10 Hz resolution for less than 1 µW of
optical power. Using the unampliﬁed output of a single
comb line for probing the Yb sample would remove the
necessity to build a separate ultra-stable probe laser at a
challenging wavelength (578 nm).

We develop a method of spectroscopy that uses a weak static magnetic ﬁeld to enable direct
optical excitation of forbidden electric-dipole transitions that are otherwise prohibitively weak. The
power of this scheme is demonstrated using the important application of optical atomic clocks based
on neutral atoms conﬁned to an optical lattice. The simple experimental implementation of this
method – a single clock laser combined with a DC magnetic ﬁeld– relaxes stringent requirements
in current lattice-based clocks (e.g., magnetic ﬁeld shielding and light polarization), and could
therefore expedite the realization of the extraordinary performance level predicted for these clocks.
We estimate that a clock using alkaline earth-like atoms such as Yb could achieve a fractional
frequency uncertainty of well below 10−17 for the metrologically preferred even isotopes.

that could enable a fractional frequency uncertainty of
well below 10−17 for a lattice clock. In contrast to multi-
photon methods proposed for the even isotopes [10, 11],
this method of direct excitation requires only a single
probe laser and no frequency-mixing schemes, so it can
be readily implemented in existing lattice clock experi-
ments. Our method is equally eﬀective for all alkaline
earth-like clock candidates (Yb, Sr, Ca, and Mg).

The long coherence times provided by “forbidden” ex-
citation to long-lived atomic states are critical in sev-
eral important applications including quantum comput-
ing and optical atomic clocks [1, 2]. However, the search
for narrower lines can lead to transitions between states
with undesirably complex structure, such as levels with
relatively large angular momentum. An important ex-
ample of an ultra-narrow transition is the 1S0
3P0 spin-
and angular momentum-forbidden clock transition in al-
kaline earth-like atoms. Two of these atoms, Sr and Yb,
are being pursued as strong candidates for lattice-based
optical atomic clocks [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The long inter-
action times, high signal-to-noise ratio, and vanishing
Doppler-related uncertainties provided by tight conﬁne-
ment of an atomic ensemble to individual optical lattice
sites should lead to exceptional short-term stability and
high accuracy in this rapidly developing ﬁeld.

Current experimental work on the optical

lattice
clock [9] focuses on the 1S0
3P0 transition in the odd
→
isotopes of Sr and Yb [3, 5, 6, 7], which is weakly al-
lowed due to hyperﬁne mixing. In comparison with their
even counterparts that have zero nuclear spin, however,
the odd isotopes have an uncomfortably large sensitivity
to magnetic ﬁelds (MHz/T) and lattice light polariza-
tion. They also have multiple ground state sub-levels
that considerably complicate spectroscopic lineshapes.
The method described in this Letter uses a small mag-
netic ﬁeld (
1 mT) to do in a controllable way for the
even isotopes what the nuclear magnetic moment does in
the odd isotopes: mix a small fraction of the nearby 3P1
state into the 3P0 state, allowing single-photon excita-
tion of the 1S0
3P0 clock transition. Estimates for Yb
using experimentally realistic linewidths (0.5 Hz) show
that induced frequency shifts can be controlled at a level

FIG. 1: Magnetic ﬁeld-induced excitation of a strongly for-
bidden transition in a generic three-level atomic system. A
small magnetic ﬁeld (∼ mT) mixes excited states |2i and |3i,
allowing single-photon excitation (for ω = ω21) of the oth-
erwise forbidden transition between states |1i and |2i. This
approach can work for a number of interesting alkaline earth-
like elements (Yb, Sr, Ca, and Mg), for which the relevant
states are labelled 2S+1LJ .

This result can also be interpreted from the perspective
of two-photon spectroscopy. In this case the expression
for V12 in Eq. 2 is the on-resonance two-photon Rabi
frequency. Speciﬁcally, if the frequency of the ﬁeld con-
necting
is set to zero, the condition for the
usual two-photon resonance (i.e., zero two-photon de-
) becomes ω = ω21. The

This broadening eﬀectively comes from the fraction of

less than 1 µHz.

In the example below we will see that reasonable exci-
tation rates lead to shifts of a few hertz or less, which
can be controlled at a much ﬁner level. Moreover, the
same induced transition rate can be realized with diﬀer-
ent combinations of ∆L and ∆B, which allows a high
degree of experimental ﬂexibility. For example, if the
magnetic ﬁeld is more easily controlled than the optical
ﬁeld, it could be preferable from the metrological view-
point to work under the condition ∆B > ∆L.

This ﬂexibility is in stark contrast to the case of the
odd isotopes. Due to their intrinsic nuclear magnetic mo-
ments, these atoms have ﬁxed eﬀective magnetic ﬁelds
1 T), which are much larger than the applied ﬁelds
(
∼
1 mT). The nuclear magnetic ﬁeld
we propose to use (
into
mixes a much larger fraction (
(see
1000x) of
2
i
|
Eq. 1), producing a natural linewidth of
15 mHz for
the forbidden transition in Yb. As a result, relatively
little probe laser intensity (a few µW/cm2) is required
to excite the forbidden transition. In exchange, however,
one ﬁnds a much larger magnetic sensitivity with a ﬁrst-
order dependence on the B ﬁeld of several MHz/T. For
reasonable experimental parameters, the light shifts are
negligible (sub-mHz), but the magnetic shifts are large,
requiring ﬁeld control (or isolation) at the 100 pT (mi-
crogauss) level. One of the strengths of our method is
that we can tune the size of the magnetic ﬁeld so that
the uncertainties resulting from the induced shifts are of
similar size. As a result, the magnetic ﬁeld shielding re-
quirements are relaxed by a factor of
1000, whereas the
light shifts remain at a manageable level (see example
below), greatly simplifying the experimental apparatus.
Let us now expand our discussion based on a three-
level atom to account for the level structure of a real
atom (refer again to Fig. 1), using the example of even
isotopes of alkaline earth-like atoms (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr,
and Yb). Our objective is to excite the forbidden (but
3P0 optical clock transition, using the
tantalizing) 1S0
→
intercombination transition 1S0
3P1 to supply the re-
quired electric-dipole interaction. The magnetic-dipole
coupling with the static ﬁeld B is implemented via the
3P1
3P0 transition. We note that the lowest-lying 1P1
state contributes to the induced transition rate in the

same way as the 3P1 state, but at a reduced level due to
its approximately ten times larger detuning.

Taking into account the vector nature of the applied
ﬁelds and the Zeeman degeneracy of the level 3P1 , the
expression for the induced transition rate in Eq. 2 takes

splittings (∆32) and electric-dipole matrix elements, how-
ever, are strongly atom-dependent (see Table 1). To eval-
uate the applicability of this method for various atoms,
it is useful to rewrite the expressions for the excitation
rate (V12) and the induced shifts (∆L,B) in terms of the
applied ﬁelds. Combining all the constant terms into a

while the light shift on the transition frequency ω21 can

where β and κ are the respective shift coeﬃcients. For
correct estimates of the light shift (i.e. the coeﬃcient κ
in Eq. 10) it is necessary to take into account the con-
tributions of all states connected by dipole transitions to
working levels 1S0 and 3P0 . In particular, the main con-
tributions to the shifts on 1S0 and 3P0 are the nearest
respective 1P1 and 3S1 states. Using Eqns. 9 and 10,
Eq. 8 can be written

dimensionless “quality” factor for the clock transition in
this scheme, since it relates the strength of the excita-
tion to the magnitudes of the induced ﬁeld shifts. A
larger value for ξ implies that for a given spectroscopic
linewidth, the induced shifts will be smaller. Note that
ξ = 1 when only the light shift on the ground state due
to level 3P1 is considered, as in a simple three-level case.

Table I summarizes the relevant parameters for four
diﬀerent alkaline earth-like atoms that have been consid-
ered as excellent clock candidates [9, 14, 15, 16]. De-
spite the wide range of intercombination transition line
strengths (given in Table 1 as natural decay rate γ) and
ﬁne structure splittings (∆32), we ﬁnd similar values for
α and ξ. Therefore the scheme proposed here may be ap-
plied to any of these atoms. This opens the door to new
clock possibilities, especially for Mg and Ca, for which
multi-photon schemes designed to use the even isotopes
require experimentally inconvenient lasers (e.g., in the
visible and IR range not covered by laser diodes). We
do emphasize, however, that the level shifts (∆L,B) will
generally be diﬀerent for the same light intensities and
magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes. Thus, diﬀerent atoms will
generally require diﬀerent combinations of ﬁeld values to
achieve comparable induced transition rates (V12) while
keeping ﬁeld shifts manageable. The values for κ in Ta-
ble 1 have an uncertainty of a few mHz/(mW/cm2) due
to uncertainties in transition rates to higher lying states,
leading to corresponding uncertainties in ξ.

Using the values for Yb, let us estimate the frequency

to its lower sensitivity to ﬁeld shifts in comparison with
proposed multi-photon schemes for the even isotopes
[10, 11], this method enables a more experimentally-
accessible excitation rate while keeping the ﬁeld shifts
well below 10−17. If we set our linewidth to the more ex-
perimentally challenging value of
10 mHz (as assumed
in Refs. [10, 11]), our ﬁeld shift uncertainties (δ(∆L,B))
contribute less than 1 part in than 1019. Of course, other
potential shifts need to be considered when determin-
ing the total uncertainty for an absolute frequency mea-
surement. For example, a particular concern for a high-
precision Yb clock is the shift due to blackbody radia-
tion, which is expected to be approximately
1.25 Hz
at room temperature with a temperature dependence of
17 mHz/K [18]. The evaluation of such small shifts
∼
will beneﬁt greatly from the high stability that could be
achieved with a lattice-based system. With a sample of
only 104 atoms, a single measurement with the required
2 s interaction time could yield an imprecision approach-
ing 10−17, assuming adequate laser pre-stabilization.

The necessary interaction time can be provided by
a non-dissipative optical lattice, which holds the atoms
against gravity. The lattice wavelength is chosen to yield
1
equal Stark shifts for the upper and lower clock states (
i
|
and
in Fig. 1) [3, 5, 9]. The lattice-induced decoher-
ence time is expected to be small compared to our pro-
jected interaction time of 2 s. An optical clock based on
odd-isotope Yb atoms conﬁned to such a shift-cancelling
lattice has been projected by Porsev et al. [14] to have a
potential fractional frequency uncertainty of 10−17. With
the scheme proposed here we could potentially achieve an
even lower uncertainty, since the even isotopes have less
magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity and no complications due to the
multiplicity of the ground state (e.g., optical pumping
and lattice polarization sensitivity). Furthermore, spec-
troscopy based on a single ground state will simplify the
determination of the unperturbed transition frequency
since only a single spectroscopic feature will be present
(instead of a multi-peaked Zeeman spectrum).

A particularly attractive aspect of this approach is that
it could be implemented in current odd isotope lattice
clock experiments with minimal change to the apparatus.
In contrast to the other schemes for the even isotopes
[10, 11], our method requires neither additional probe
lasers nor associated non-linear optics to perform requi-
site sum/diﬀerence frequency generation. Instead only a
modest magnetic ﬁeld needs to be generated, which can
be done with a pair of current-carrying Helmholtz coils.
In summary, we have shown that strongly forbidden
transitions can be accessed via single-photon excitation
with the application of a relatively weak static mag-
netic ﬁeld. With this method reasonable excitation rates
can be achieved without inducing signiﬁcant Stark shifts,
Zeeman shifts, or line broadening. Using Yb as an ex-
ample, we have demonstrated how this approach could
enable an optical lattice-based clock using the even iso-

4

topes of alkaline earth-like atoms. The even isotopes are
far less sensitive to magnetic ﬁelds and have much sim-
pler structure than their odd counterparts. We also note
that this method can be adapted to enable transitions
between states
of the same parity (but with
state
of opposite parity) by replacing the static mag-
3

netic ﬁeld with a static electric ﬁeld.

Abstract

The coupled-channel model [Phys. Rev. A 59, 363 (1999)] that yields converged

low-energy phase shifts, and exact binding and resonance features in Ps-H [Phys.

Rev. A 59, 2058 (1999)] is applied to study Ps-He+ scattering. Similar to PsH,

resonances appear in the S−, P −, D−, etc partial waves in the Ps-He+ system but in

both the singlet and triplet scattering channels. The latter signiﬁes possible Rydberg

states of e+ around singlet and triplet helium. The S-wave singlet resonance at 2.79

eV agrees to that predicted earlier in e+-He entrance channel (energy diﬀerence

16.64 eV) at 19.27 eV [Chem. Phys. Lett. 262, 460 (1996)].

Introduction : Ps-H is a fundamental few-body system containing the positronium

atom and has got an active theoretical [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and

recent experimental [15] interest. In this article, we present an investigation on ortho-

Ps scattering from singly ionized helium atom. The system is apparently similar to the

four-body Ps-H system, but provides the following additional interests. Firstly, within a

similar four-body framework, we can study Ps scattering dynamics relating to an ionic

target, where short-range exchange correlation is also present. So far, Ps-ion scattering

studies have been conﬁned mostly to bare ions [16, 17] (except a few studies [18, 19]) where

there is no role for the Pauli exclusion principle to play in absence of indistinguishable

fermions (electrons). Pauli exclusion principle introduces short-range exchange forces

which become crucial for Ps scattering. Because, in absence of exchange, the potential

in the elastic channel becomes exactly zero due to charge and mass symmetry of Ps [20].

Thus in order to have a comprehensive picture of the Ps-ion scattering dynamics, it is

important to investigate Ps scattering from an ionic target that has indistinguishable

fermions (electron or positron).

Secondly, we recall that, at low energies Coulomb interaction of positronium atom (Ps)

with hydrogen like system, leads to interesting consequences like formation of resonances

[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and chemical binding [5, 13, 14, 15]. It has been interpreted

in a Ps-H system that, the positron forms Rydberg states with the residual H− ion [2].

The lowest order Rydberg state in the series lies below the Ps-H scattering threshold and

leads to chemical binding. Higher order states lie above the scattering threshold and lead

to resonances in the Ps-H continuum [6]. In Ps-H, the residual H− can exist only in the

singlet state and all these resonances and binding reported so far are in the singlet state.

For Ps-He+ system, the positron shall ﬁnd a residual helium atom which can have both

singlet and triplet spin conﬁgurations, unlike the Ps-H case. So, in principle, in Ps-He+,

resonances could appear in both the singlet and triplet scattering channels. Recently,

2

a metastable state for positronic helium (e+He) is predicted [21] with a binding energy

of -2.2505916 Hatree and the state is found to be stable under dissociation into PsHe+

with a binding energy of -0.0005916 Hatree. The chemical stability of PsHe+ once again

triggers the speculation of resonances like those obtained in the PsH system.

As in Ps-H [8, 10], we consider coupling of Ps-states to He+ ion and investigate target

elastic processes. As He+ is a tightly bound system, we understand that target inelastic

processes will not be signiﬁcant owing to its small polarizability compared to that of

the Ps. However, charge-transfer rearrangement like Ps+He+ → e++He is a relevant

process and is expected to have its impact over target-elastic and target-inelastic processes.

However, we understand that such channels are relevant in a complete ab initio calculation

where explicit electron-electron correlation and continuum eﬀects are essential to achieve

convergence. Here, we are using regularized exchange-correlation potentials which are

able to simulate the correlation and continuum eﬀects [8, 9, 10] (detailed in the theory

section). So, we abstain from considering such channels explicitly. Since, their explicit

inclusion in the present model may lead to overcompleteness of the Hilbert space.

Theory: The theoretical formulation of the Ps-He+ scattering is very similar to that

of the Ps-H system except the diﬀerence comes from the nuclear charge, in the interaction

potential and target wave function. With an antisymmetrized total wave function [7, 9,

11], the momentum space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, for a particular electronic spin

state S, takes the following form [11, 12].

total energy of the system; ǫν′′ and Υµ′′ represent the binding energies of Ps and target

respectively. We need to solve two sets of coupled equations corresponding to singlet

and triplet scattering channels given by S = 0, 1. The corresponding spin-averaged input

potentials are given by

B0,1
ν′µ′νµ(kf , ki) = BD

ν′µ′νµ(kf , ki) + (−1)0,1BE

ν′µ′νµ(kf , ki)

(2)

Where, BD and BE are the direct Born and Born-Oppenheimer (BO) exchange ampli-

tudes, respectively. The expression for BD can be simpliﬁed and be represented as [22]:

BD

ν′µ′,νµ(kf , ki) = −

q2 < φµ′(r1)|2 − eiq.r1|φµ(r1) >
× < χν′(t2)|eiq.t2/2 − e−iq.t2/2|χν(t2) >,

where q = ki − kf and φµ’s and χν’s are the eigenstates of He+ and Ps atom, respectively.

tj = rj − x; x and rj are the coordinates of the positron and the electron of the Ps atom.

For BE, we use the following non-local form [10, 23], similar to that applied in PsH case:

BE

ν′µ′,νµ(kf , ki) =

Q2 < φµ′(r)|eiq.r|φµ(r) >

where, Q2 = (k2

making use of the eﬀective following type of transformations to the exact BO expression

used to simulate the factor C 2[(α2

of the system in au or facilitate any variation to this as has been eﬀectively done for several

electron impact cases [24]. It is of signiﬁcant advantage that at asymptotic energies, both

the value of the parameter C and the regularized form above, do loose their signiﬁcance

and the exchange potential (BE) and hence the solution of the coupled-equations coalesce,

respectively, with those of the exact CC formalism. In the present work, however, we do

not indulge to any ﬁtting and rather paralyze the sensitivity of the parameter by re-

introducing it in the following way: Q2

f + k2
and by ﬁxing C 2 = 0.5 so that the expression (β2

j = (k2

average binding energies (between initial and ﬁnal channel) of the electron of Ps and He+

in au, in which the calculation is performed.

Numerical Procedures : The three-dimensional LS equations, for a particular

electronic-spin state (S) are decomposed to coupled one-dimensional partial wave equa-

tions, which are then solved by the method of matrix inversion [11, 17]. For the present

ionic target, we register a slow convergence with respect to partial wave contributions,

compared to the neutral atomic target. We had to employ as much as thirty partial waves

at around 50-60eV incident energies, which is almost twice to that employed for Ps-H case.

Also, the convergence is found to be slow with respect to the mesh points that discretizes

the kernel of the coupled-equations. We take maximum 48 mesh points to discretize the

kernel compared to a maximum 32 points taken for Ps-H. Present results are numerically

convergent upto fourth signiﬁcant digit.

Results and Discussions : We ﬁrst discuss the results for the partial and total

cross sections. In ﬁgure 1, we plot the angle integrated partial cross sections containing

elastic and inelastic transitions of Ps. Elastic (thin solid curve), Ps(1s→2s) (dotted curve)

and Ps(1s→2p) (short-dashed curve) transition cross sections are obtained by solving

coupled equations using a 3-Ps-state expansion. Results for Ps(1s→ nlm; 3 ≤ n ≤ 6),

5

discrete excitations (long-dashed curve) and ionization (dot-dashed curve) cross sections

are obtained employing a ﬁrst Born approximation including exchange. Total (target

elastic) cross sections which are constructed from the results of Ps-elastic and all Ps-

inelastic cross sections, are also plotted in this ﬁgure (thick solid curve). At low energies,

the elastic and total cross sections have a sharp fall compared to those of the Ps-H system.

Similar sharp fall in the cross section is also observed in the variational calculations for Ps-

He+ and Ps-p scatterings [19] and in the coupled-channel calculation for Ps-p scattering

[17].

At low energies, Van Reeth and Humberston (VRH) [19], employing a two-channel

Kohn variational method, observed a Ramsauer minimum for the elastic cross sections

near 0.02 au of Ps energy and a gentle rise thereafter. We do not observe any such

minimum in our elastic cross sections but otherwise observe a gross agreement with

VRH. To understand the diﬀerence we recently perform a similar two-channel ab ini-

tio CC calculation employing exact exchange and considering the charge-transfer reaction

Ps+He+ → e++He. In our preliminary results [25] we also do not record any such Ram-

sauer minimum. Further insight seems warranted regarding the minimum.

At medium to high energies, we can expect the He+ to behave more like a bare proton

and we ﬁnd our results to agree with those of Ps-p scattering cross sections. At 61.2 eV,

the lowest energy considered by Ratnavelu et al [26], the elastic and Ps(1s→2p) cross

sections are given by 0.5068 πa2

0 and 8.426 πa2

0 while the present predictions for them are

0.5184 πa2

0 and 8.198 πa2

0 respectively. For Ps(1s→2s) the agreement is not so close but

fair; at 61.2 eV, the present prediction is 1.712 πa2

0 compared to 1.166 of Ratnavelu et

al [26]. While elastic and Ps(2p) cross sections agree so well, the diﬀerence in the Ps(2s)

result is not clearly understood. Among all the partial cross sections, the ionization of Ps

dominates the most and this, along with other Ps-inelastic processes, causes a maximum

in the total cross section beyond the Ps excitation and ionization thresholds (5.1-6.8 eV).

6

This is a characteristic obtained in almost all Ps scattering calculations [8, 9, 10, 23, 27]

and also observed in the measured data [28, 29, 30].

For Ps-He+, the major interest is about possible resonances, similar to Ps-H. This has

become more relevant after Ryzhik and Mitroy [21] have found the theoretical evidence

of a metastable Ps-He+ state with a small binding energy of -0.0005916 Hatree. So,

with a possible molecule like feature, which has been predicted recently in PsH [31, 32],

multiple resonances could prevail in the Ps-He+ system corresponding to various excited

levels. As in the cases of Ps-H [9] and Ps-Li [33], we notice that there does not exist any

resonant structure at the static exchange level and the resonances are manifested with

the introduction of Ps-excited states in the coupling scheme.

In ﬁgure 1, we plot the

singlet and triplet scattering cross sections for a) S-wave, b) P −wave, and c) D-wave

for the three-Ps-state model. As expected, multiple resonances are found in both the

singlet and triplet scattering channels with each singlet state resonance is accompanied

by a corresponding triplet state resonance. For Ps-H [2] and Ps-Li [33], it was assumed

that the resonances are appearing due to Rydberg states of the positron around the

singlet state H− and Li− ions, respectively and so resonances appeared there in the singlet

channel only. However, in Ps-He+, the positron can have Rydberg states around both

the singlet and triplet spin conﬁgurations of the helium atom and so resonances were

expected in both the channels. The fact that each singlet state resonance is accompanied

by a corresponding triplet state resonance and they appear in pairs is quite consistent

with the energy spectrum of helium where each electronic singlet-state conﬁguration has

its triplet counterpart.

For S-wave, the singlet state resonances appear at 2.79 eV, 4.2 eV, and 4.85eV, while

the triplet state resonances appear at 3.28 eV, 4.51 eV and 4.94 eV (see ﬁg-2a). The widths

are approximately given by 0.07 eV, 0.04 eV and 0.02 eV for the singlet state resonances

and 0.065 eV, 0.02 eV, and 0.0001 eV, for the triplet state resonances, respectively. We

7

note that, the triplet channel resonances appear beyond the corresponding singlet channel

resonances, in the energy scale. In the spin-singlet channel, the short-range potential is

attractive and it constructively combines with the long-range polarization potential, while

for the triplet channel, the short-range potential is repulsive and it makes a destructive

cancellation with the attractive polarization potential arising in the calculation through

inclusion of Ps(1s → 2p) transition in the coupling. We understand that this could be

the reason that the triplet channel resonances are placed beyond the singlet channel ones.

The energy diﬀerence between corresponding singlet-triplet resonance pairs is found to

diminish (0.49 eV, 0.31 eV, and 0.09 eV) gradually for higher order resonances. This

is also consistent with the fact that the energy diﬀerence between singlet-triplet levels,

diminish with higher excited states of helium. Similar features are also obtained for the

P − and D−wave resonances. In all the cases we ﬁnd three pair of resonances below the

ﬁrst excitation threshold of Ps (at 5.1 eV).

From ﬁgure 2b, we see that the P −wave resonances appear at 3.55 eV, 4.64 eV, and

4.99 eV for the singlet state and at 3.65 eV, 4.71 eV, and 5.0 eV for the triplet state.

The energy diﬀerence between singlet-triplet pairs are given by 0.10 eV, 0.07 eV, and

0.01 eV, respectively and are also diminuing with higher order resonances. For D− wave

resonances, the energy diﬀerence between a singlet-triplet pair diminishes further and the

singlet and triplet resonances almost overlap with each other (see ﬁg-2c). Their positions

are given by 4.19 eV, 4.907 eV, and 5.096 eV for the singlet state and 4.2 eV, 4.909 eV,

and 5.096 eV for the triplet state, respectively.

Now, we focus our attention to search for matching of these resonances to physical

levels of the four-body Ps-He+ system. It could be mentioned here that, in Ps-H, such

correspondence has been found to exist [32]. The lowest order S−wave and P −wave

singlet channel resonances are obtained at 2.79 eV and 3.55 eV. It is of interest to ﬁnd

that the lowest excited singlet s−state and p−state of He exist at 2.908 eV (-58.292-

8

(54.4-6.8)), and 3.47 eV (-57.73-(-54.4-6.8)). So, it is quite reasonable to believe that the

above two resonances are the manifestations of the rearrangement levels e+-He(1s,21s and

e+-He(1s21p) of the Ps-He+ system.

Further, it is quite relevant to note that the above lowest S−wave singlet resonance at

2.79 eV corresponds quite well to the S−wave singlet channel resonance predicted in the

e+−He entrance channel at 19.27 eV by Adhikari and Ghosh [18]. The correspondence

becomes apparent when one takes into account the entrance channel energy diﬀerence of

16.64 eV between the two systems.

Manifestation of additional resonances seems to be quite relevant with the following

new ﬁndings. Recently, Ryzhik and Mitroy [21] have concluded that PsHe+ can exist in a

metastable state with a small binding energy of -0.0005916 Hatree (resembling similarity

to Ps-H). And secondly, Saito [31] and Biswas and Darewych [32] have recently found

that the PsH system might have a molecule like feature, in addition to its proposed atom

like feature [2] of a moving positron around a H− ion. So, the metastable PsHe+ can lead

to various excited levels before dissociation into Ps and He+ or e+ and He. These levels

may well be reﬂected as Feshbach resonances in the scattering dynamics of Ps-He+ and

the additional resonances are thus worth further investigation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, we have studied positronium (Ps) scattering from singly

ionized helium atom employing the model that yielded precise resonance positions and

binding energies for PsH system. We ﬁnd new resonances in both the singlet and triplet

scattering channels.

In the light of Ps-H and Ps-Li resonances, these are supposed to

be due to the manifestation of positronic Rydberg states around the singlet and triplet

states of the residual helium atom. We ﬁnd strong correlation between few of the low ly-

ing resonances and some rearrangement levels of the four-body Ps-He+ system. Although

the S-wave resonance predicted earlier in the e+He entrance channel [18] is yet to be ver-

iﬁed experimentally, we consider that the present work delivers a noteworthy information

9

that a completely diﬀerent type of investigation also reveal the same. In addition, the

model predicts new resonances which seem to be of real interest because of the following

two recently found physical features. Recently, Ryzhik and Mitroy [21] has reported a

metastable state for the Ps-He+ with a small binding energy of -0.0005916 Hatree. On

the other hand, Saito [31] and Biswas and Darewych [32] have found that the four-body

Ps-H system can have a molecule like manifestation, in addition to its proposed atom-like

structure [2]. So, a possible molecule like feature for the metastable PsHe+ system would

certainy account for many of these additional resonances.

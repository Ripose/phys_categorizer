Symmetry of carrier-envelope phase diﬀerence eﬀects in strong-ﬁeld, few-cycle
ionization of atoms and molecules

In few-cycle pulses, the exact value of the carrier-envelope phase diﬀerence (CEPD) has a pro-
nounced inﬂuence on the ionization dynamics of atoms and molecules. We show that for atoms in
circularly polarized light, a change in the CEPD is mapped uniquely to an overall rotation of the
system, and results for arbitrary CEPD are obtained by rotation of the results from a single calcu-
lation with ﬁxed CEPD. For molecules this is true only for linear molecules aligned parallel with the
propagation direction of the ﬁeld. The eﬀects of CEPD are classiﬁed as geometric or non-geometric.
The observations are exempliﬁed by strong-ﬁeld calculations on hydrogen.

Nowadays, it is possible to construct and control in-
tense laser pulses with only a few optical cycles [1],
i.e., pulses described by a vector potential of the form
~A(t) = A0f (t) sin(ω(t
τ
2 ) + φ)ˆe, where A0 is the am-
plitude, f (t) is the envelope, τ is the pulse length, ω is
the frequency, φ is the carrier-envelope phase diﬀerence
(CEPD), and ˆe is the polarization vector. The corre-
sponding electric ﬁeld is obtained from the vector poten-
∂t ~A(t), and is shown in Fig. 1 for a sin2
tial by ~E(t) =
envelope. Such pulses can be used to probe molecular and
atomic dynamics on a very short time scale [2, 3]. The
associated ionization dynamics becomes sensitive to the
exact shape of the pulse and the carrier-envelope phase
diﬀerence (CEPD) (see Fig. 1). This dependence may
be understood by the exponential dependence of the ion-
ization rate on the instantaneous ﬁeld strength and the
corresponding emergence of the electron into the ﬁeld-
dressed continuum at speciﬁc instants of time during the
pulse [4]. Asymmetries in the photoelectron spectrum
may give information about the CEPD, and hence help
in the characterization of the ﬁeld. Electrons released at
diﬀerent times are accelerated to diﬀerent ﬁnal momenta
and this fact is exploited in attosecond streaking [5] to
map the time distribution of the pulse into a momen-
tum distribution of the photoelectron, and to charac-
terize the ultra-fast pulses [6]. Hence, just as few-cycle
pulses are diagnostic tools for atoms and small molecules,
the very same systems serve as diagnostic tools for the
pulses themselves [7]. The latter statement, of course, as-
sumes that an accurate theoretical description is at hand
for the pulsed laser–matter interaction. It is the purpose
of this work to add further to this understanding. In par-
ticular we are concerned with the CEPD eﬀects, and a
geometric interpretation of these.

Carrier-envelope phase diﬀerence eﬀects were stud-
ied theoretically with emphasis on CEPD-induced spa-
tial asymmetries in the ATI-spectrum/angular distribu-
tion in a number of papers on strong-ﬁeld ionization of
atoms [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and molecules [13], strong-ﬁeld
dissociation [14], and high-harmonic generation [15]. The

FIG. 1: (Color online). The electric ﬁeld E(t)/E0, normalized
to the peak ﬁeld strength E0 and the pulse envelope f (t) as a
function of time for two values of the CEPD, φ. The electric
ﬁeld points in opposite directions for φ = 0 and φ = π. In ion-
ization, the electric ﬁeld will shake the electron until it gains
enough energy to escape the Coulomb potential, and the an-
gular distribution will depend on CEPD because the electric
ﬁeld (and the force ~F = − ~E) points in opposite directions for
φ = 0 and φ = π. The ﬁeld parameters are τ = 441 a.u. and
ω = 0.057 a.u. (800 nm).

asymmetries can be used to extract information about
and ultimately to measure the CEPD. In Ref. [16] a spa-
tial asymmetry in ionization with few-cycle circular po-
In
larized laser pulses was observed for the ﬁrst time.
Ref. [17] the generation of intense few-cycle laser pulses
with stable CEPD was demonstrated, and a way of mea-
suring CEPD, based on soft-X-ray radiation was pre-
sented. In Ref. [18] a spatial asymmetry in the ionization
with few-cycle linear polarized laser pulses was measured,
and the CEPD was determined with an estimated error
of π/10. Asymmetries in the ionization signal combined
with an attosecond pump pulse [6] were used to measure
directly the ﬁeld of a linearly polarized few-cycle pulse [7].
Very recently, the detailed control over the CEPD played
a crucial role in attosecond electron dynamics [18, 19, 20],
and experiments supporting the present ﬁndings have
been reported at conferences [21].

In this work, we present a systematic theoretical study
of the symmetry of the response of atomic and molecular
systems under a change of the CEPD in few-cycle pulses,

and we exemplify the discussion with a study of the dif-
ferential electron momentum distribution for hydrogen
under such pulses.

We start out by considering an n-electron atom inter-
acting with a few-cycle circularly polarized laser pulse
described by the vector potential

the spatial dependence of the ﬁeld, the interaction of the
atom with the ﬁeld is obtained by the minimal coupling

where H0 is the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian. We are interested
in relating this equation to an equation for the φ = 0
case. To this end, we note that the unitary operator
D(φ) = exp (iJzφ), where Jz is the total angular mo-
mentum, corresponds to a rotation of our system by an
angle
φ around the z-axis. Since H0 is invariant un-
der rotations around the z-axis, the transformed wave
function Ψ′ = D(φ)Ψ satisﬁes the Shr¨odinger equation,

When we compare (2) and (4), we see that a change in the
CEPD from φ = 0 to φ = φ ′ corresponds to a rotation
of our system around the z-axis by the angle φ ′. This
fact is not only theoretically interesting, but also helpful
in practical calculations since this symmetry property re-
duces the number of computations one has to perform to
a single one – all other results are obtained by suitable
rotations. For instance, imagine we are interested in the
diﬀerential ionization probability dPf i
(φ) for the mo-
dqxdqy
menta qx, qy in the polarization plane and for a general
φ > 0. Then we calculate dPf i
(φ = 0), and rotate the
dqxdqy
result counterclockwise by an angle φ to obtain dPf i
dqxdqy

(φ).

In the above derivation it is essential that the ﬁeld-free
Hamiltonian H0 is invariant to rotations around the z-
axis. If this is not the case, the proof breaks down. As
an example we look at ionization of diatomic molecules,
or more generally linear molecules, in circularly polar-
ized few-cycle laser pulses.
If the molecule is aligned
along the laser propagation direction, then the ﬁeld-free
Hamiltonian still has the required symmetry and the the-
orem holds.
If the molecule is not aligned along this
axis, the system does not have the required symmetry
and CEPD eﬀects can not be reduced to a geometrical
rotation. Accordingly, we may make a distinction be-
tween rotational invariant atomic and molecular systems
where the CEPD eﬀects are purely geometric rotations,
and systems which are not rotational invariant in which
case true non-geometrical CEPD eﬀects occur. For ex-
ample, the results on strong-ﬁeld ionization of K+
2 with
the molecule in the polarization plane [13] belong to the
latter category.

As an illustration of the present ﬁndings, we consider
ionization of atomic hydrogen, H(1s), in the strong-ﬁeld
approximation (SFA) [23]. We assume the dipole ap-
proximation which means that η = ωt in (1) and use
∂t ~A. The probability amplitude for direct

fortunately, in exact theory, it is not possible to separate
the eﬀects of the circularly polarized ﬁelds, since they
do not individually commute with the ﬁeld-free Hamil-
tonian. Nevertheless, in approximate theories like, e.g.,
the SFA, the interactions separate, and it is possible to
give an interpretation of CEPD eﬀects also in this case.

The ﬁrst term comes from EL, the second term comes

diatomic molecules aligned along the propagation direc-

tion. Imagine that we want to know
(qx, qy, qz) for, say, 10 diﬀerent values of φ. Then Eq. (6),
and the discussion above show that we only have to cal-
culate TL(qx, qy, qz) for φ = 0. Figure 4 shows two ex-
amples for a linear ﬁeld corresponding to the φ = 0 and
φ = π/2 cases in Fig. 2. For φ = 0 we obtain constructive
interference in the positive qy direction. For φ = π/2 we
obtain two peaks, and compared with the φ = 0 result
the peaks have moved to smaller values of
. This shift
may be understood by looking at the φ = 0, π/2
in
cases in Fig. 2, in combination with (6). In the φ = 0 case
the two circularly polarized ﬁelds result in constructive
interference in the positive qy direction. In the φ = π/2
case, we see from Fig. 2 that the maxima along qy have
moved to smaller distances and the interference cancels
the probability at negative qx (φ = π/2), and positive qx

In this work, we provided an exact characterization
of CEPD eﬀects in the interaction between circularly
polarized few-cycle pulses and multielectron atoms and
molecules including full account of the spatial depen-
dence of the ﬁeld (non-dipole eﬀects). For systems which
are invariant to rotations around the propagation direc-
tion of the ﬁeld, a change of the CEPD corresponds to
a rotation of the systems. For rotationally non-invariant
systems, true non-geometrical CEPD eﬀects may be ob-
served. Calculations on H(1s) quantiﬁed the eﬀects, and
showed that observation of the momentum distribution
can be used to measure CEPD for a circularly polar-
ized laser pulse. For linearly polarized ﬁelds, a symmetry

SFA), allowed us to obtain results for arbitrary CEPD
from a single calculation by suitable rotation and reﬂec-
tion. The particular properties of the response to the
linearly polarized ﬁeld was explained in terms of inter-
ference of two circularly polarized ﬁelds.

There is currently considerable interest in control
of the response of atoms and small molecules to a
strong few-cycle pulse [4], e.g., in connection with align-
ment dependent high-harmonic generation from small
molecules [25, 26]. Here the harmonics provide a deli-
cate probe of the molecular wave packet dynamics and,
in turn, steering the electronic wave packets controls the
harmonics. The carrier-envelope-phase diﬀerence is one
of the essential control parameters in few-cycle pulse and
attosecond science.

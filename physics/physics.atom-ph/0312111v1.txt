Abstract. The angular distribution of the emitted electrons, following the two–
photon ionization of the hydrogen–like ions, is studied within the framework of second
order perturbation theory and the Dirac equation. Using a density matrix approach, we
have investigated the eﬀects which arise from the polarization of the incoming light as
well as from the higher multipoles in the expansion of the electron–photon interaction.
For medium– and high–Z ions, in particular, the non–dipole contributions give rise to
a signiﬁcant change in the angular distribution of the emitted electrons, if compared
with the electric–dipole approximation. This includes a strong forward emission while,
in dipole approximation, the electron emission always occurs symmetric with respect
to the plane which is perpendicular to the photon beam. Detailed computations for
the dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions on the polarization of the
incident light are carried out for the ionization of the H, Xe53+ and U91+ (hydrogen–
like) ions.

1. Introduction

During the last decades, the multi–photon ionization of atoms and ions has been
widely studied, both experimentally and theoretically. While, however, the majority
of experiments were ﬁrst of all concerned with the multi–photon ionization of complex
atoms, most theoretical investigations instead dealt with the ionization (and excitation)
of the much simpler hydrogen–like and helium–like systems. For atomic hydrogen, in
contrast, multi–photon experiments were rather scarce so far (Wolﬀ et al 1988, Rottke
et al 1990, Antoine et al 1996) mainly because of the lack of suﬃciently intensive (and
coherent) light sources in the UV and EUV region. With the recent progress in the set–
up of intensive light sources in the EUV and x–ray domain, such as the fourth–generation
synchrotron facilities or variously proposed free–electron lasers, two– and multi–photon
studies on the ionization of inner–shell electrons are now becoming more likely to be

carried out in the future (Kornberg et al 2002), including case studies on medium–Z
and high–Z hydrogen–like ions . With increasing charge (and intensity of the light), of
course, relativistic eﬀects will become important and have been investigated in the past
for the two–photon excitation and decay (Goldman and Drake 1981, Szymanowski et al
1997, Santos et al 2001) as well as ionization (Koval et al 2003) of hydrogen–like ions.
So far, however, all of these studies were focused on the total (excitation or decay) rates
and ionization cross sections while, to the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been
made to analyze the eﬀects of relativity on angular resolved studies.

In this contribution, we explore the angular distribution of the electrons following
the two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions. Second–order perturbation theory,
based on Dirac’s equation, is applied to calculate the two–photon amplitudes including
the full (relativistic) electron–photon interaction. The angular distribution of the photo-
electrons are then derived by means of the density matrix theory which has been found
appropriate for most collision and ionization processes and, in particular, for the –
nonrelativistic – two–photon angular–dependent studies (Laplanche et al 1986). Since,
however, the basic concepts of the density matrix theory has been presented elsewhere
at various places (Blum 1981, Balashov et al 2000), we will restrict ourselves to rather
a short account of this theory in Subsection 2.1. Apart from a few basic relations, here
we only show how the angular distribution of the electrons can be traced back to the
two–photon transition amplitudes. The evaluation of these amplitudes in second–order
perturbation theory and by means of Coulomb–Green’s functions are discussed later
in Subsections 2.2 and 2.3, and including the full decomposition of the photon ﬁeld in
terms of its multipole components in Subsection 2.4. Using such a decomposition, we
have calculated the electron angular distributions for the two–photon ionization of the
1s ground state of hydrogen (H) as well as hydrogen–like xenon (Xe53+) and uranium
(U91+). By comparing the angular distributions for diﬀerent nuclear charges Z, we
were able to analyze both, the eﬀects of the polarization of the – incoming – light
and the contributions from higher (i.e. non–dipole) multipoles in the decomposition of
the electron–photon interaction. These results are displayed in Section 3 and clearly
show that, with increasing charge Z, the higher multipole components lead to a strong
emission in forward direction (i.e. parallel to the propagation of the light), while the
electric–dipole approximation alone gives rise to a symmetric electron emission around
the polar angle θ = 90◦, similar as obtained by nonrelativistic computations (Zernik
1964, Lambropoulus 1972, Arnous et al 1973). Finally, a brief summary on the two–
photon ionization of medium and high–Z ions is given in Section 4.

2. Theory

2.1. Density matrix approach

Within the density matrix theory, the state of a physical system is described in terms of
so–called statistical (or density) operators (Fano 1957). These operators can be consi-

3

dered to represent, for instance, an ensemble of systems which are — altogether —
in either a pure quantum state or in a mixture of diﬀerent states with any degree of
coherence. Then, the basic idea of the density matrix formalism is to accompany such
an ensemble through the collision process, starting from a well deﬁned ’initial’ state and
by passing through one or, possibly, several intermediate states until the ’ﬁnal’ state of
the collision process is attained.

In the two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions, the ’initial’ state of the (com-
bined) system ’ion plus photons’ is given by the bound electron
and the two
incoming photons, if we assume a zero nuclear spin I = 0. For the sake of simplicity,
we also restrict our treatment to the case that both photons will have equal momentum:
k1 = k2 = k, while the spin states of the photons may still diﬀer from each other and
are characterized in terms of the helicity parameters λ1, λ2 =
1 (i.e. by means of
their spin projections onto the direction of propagation k). Of course, the case of equal
photon momenta k correspond to the most frequent experimental set–up of the two–
photon ionization of atoms and ions using, for instance, lasers or synchrotron radiation
sources. With these assumptions in mind, the initial spin state of the overall system
is determined by the direct product of the statistical operators of the ion and the two
incident photons

In the ’ﬁnal’ state of the ionization, after the electron has left the nucleus, we just
have a free electron with asymptotic momentum p and spin projection ms (as well as
the bare residual ion with nuclear charge Z). Therefore, the ﬁnal spin state is described
by the statistical operator of the emitted (free) electron ˆρe which, in the framework of
the density matrix theory, can be obtained from the initial–state density operator ˆρi
owing to the relation (Blum 1981, Balashov et al 2000)

In this simple relation, ˆR is called the transition operator and must describe the
interaction of the electron with the (two photons of the) radiation ﬁeld. Of course,
the particular form of the transition operator ˆR depends on the framework in which we
describe the coupling of the radiation ﬁeld to the atom. As appropriate for high–Z ions,
below we will always refer to a relativistic treatment of the electron–photon interaction,
based on Dirac’s equation and the minimal coupling of the radiation ﬁeld (Berestetskii
et al 1971).

Instead of applying Eq. (3), in practice, it is often more convenient to re–write
the statistical operators in a matrix representation. Using, for example, the initial spin

in order to represent the transition amplitudes for the two–photon ionization. The ﬁnal–
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
state density matrix (4) still contains the complete information about the ionization
process (i.e. the properties of the bare ion and the electron) and, thus, can be used
to derive all the observable properties of the photoelectrons. Obviously, however, the
outcome of some considered experiment will depend on the particular set–up and the
capability of the detectors for resolving the individual properties of the particles. In the
density matrix theory, this set–up of the experiment is typically described in terms of a
(so–called) detector operator ˆP which characterizes the detector system as a whole. In
fact, this detector operator can be considered to project out all those quantum states of
the ﬁnal–state system which leads to a ’count’ at the detectors; in the language of the
density matrix, therefore, the probability for an ’event’ at the detector is simply given
by the trace of the detector operator with the density matrix: W = Tr( ˆP ˆρ) .

To determine, for instance, the angular distribution of the emitted (photo–) elec-
trons, we may assume a detector operator in a given direction ˆp = (θ, φ) [cf. Figure 1]
which is insensitive to the polarization of the electrons

i.e. a projection operator along p and including a summation over the spin state ms
of the electrons. From this operator, and by taking the trace over the product ( ˆP ˆρf )
with the ﬁnal–state density matrix (4), we obtain immediately the electron angular
distribution in the form

where, for the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the hydrogen–like ion is initially
unpolarized. Apart from this additional assumption, however, Eq. (7) still represents
the general form of the electron angular distribution for the process of the two–photon
ionization of hydrogen–like ions. As seen from this equation, the emission of the
photoelectron will depend on the spin state of the incident photons, deﬁned by the
photon density matrices
. For any further evaluation of this distribution

function, therefore, we shall ﬁrst specify these density matrices or, in other words, the
polarization of the incoming light. For example, if both photons are unpolarized, the
= δλλ′/2
(two) photon density matrices simply reduce to a constant 1/2,
[cf. Appendix, Eq. A.2] and leads us to the angular distribution

For many (modern) light sources such as lasers or synchrotron radiation, it is not
very practical to consider only unpolarized light from the very beginning. In general,
instead, the angular distribution of the emitted electrons will depend both on the type
as well as the degree of the polarization of the incident light. For circularly polarized
light with degree PC, for instance, the photon density matrix from Eq. (7) becomes
kλ

= (1 + λPC) δλλ′/2 and, hence, give rise to the angular distribution

following the two–
For any further analysis of the electron angular distributions,
photon ionization of a hydrogen–like ion, we need to calculate the transition amplitude
Mbp(ms, µb, λ1, λ2) as seen from Eqs. (8)–(10). This amplitude describes a bound–free
transition of the electron under the (simultaneous) absorption of two photons. For
a moderate intensity of the photon ﬁeld, of course, this amplitude is most simply
calculated by means of second–order perturbation theory (Laplanche et al 1976)

where the transition operator α uλ eikr describes the (relativistic) electron–photon inter-
action, the unit vector uλ the polarization of the photons, and where the summation
runs over the complete one–particle spectrum. In Equation (11), we added the factor
2
√8π3/αEγ in order to ensure that the squared transition amplitude
|
has a proper dimension of cross section. From the energy conservation, moreover,
it follows immediately that the energies of the initial bound state, Eb, and the ﬁnal
continuum state, Ef , are related to each other by Ef = Eb + 2Eγ, owing to the energy
of the incoming photons, which can be written in Hartree atomic units as Eγ = k/α.
Although known for a long time, the relativistic form of the transition amplitude (11) has
been used only recently in studying multi–photon ionization processes and, in particular,
in order to calculate the total ionization cross sections along the hydrogen isoelectronic
sequence (Koval et al 2003). In such a relativistic description of the transition amplitude
pmsi
(11), the initial state ψnbjbµb(r) =

continuum electron, respectively (Berestetskii et al 1971).

As seen from Eq. (11), the evaluation of the transition amplitude requires a
summation over the discrete (bound) states as well as an integration over the continuum
of the Dirac Hamiltonian, (ψν, Eν).
In fact, such a ’summation’ over the complete
spectrum is diﬃcult to carry out explicitly since, in particular the integration over the
continuum requires the calculation of free–free transitions. This summation, therefore, is
sometimes restricted to some small — discrete — basis, assuming that the contribution
from the continuum is negligible. In practice, however, such a limitation seems justiﬁed
only to estimate the behaviour of the cross sections near the resonances where the ion
is rather likely excited by the ﬁrst photon into some – real – intermediate state of the
ion from which it is later ionized by means of a second photon. In the non–resonant
region of the photon energies, in contrast, the integration over the continuum may give
rise to a rather remarkable contribution to the total cross section and, hence, has to
be carried out. Apart from a direct summation over the continuum states, however, it
is often more favorable to apply Green’s functions, at least if these functions can be
generated eﬃciently. For hydrogen–like ions, for example, such Green’s functions are
known analytically, both in the nonrelativistic as well as relativistic theory (Swainson
and Drake 1991).

For hydrogen–like ions, the Coulomb–Green’s functions from Eq. (12) are known
analytically today in terms of (various) special functions from mathematical physics
and, in particular, in terms of the conﬂuent hypergeometric function 1F1(a, b; z). Here,
we will not display these functions explicitly but refer the reader instead to the literature
(Swainson and Drake 1991, Koval and Fritzsche 2003). For the further evaluation of
the transition amplitudes (14) let us note only that, also for the one–particle Dirac
Hamiltonian, the Coulomb–Green’s function can be decomposed into a radial and an
angular part

is given in terms of four components gT T ′
Eκ (r, r′) with T = L, S referring to the large and
small components of the associated (relativistic) wave functions. The computation of
the radial Green’s function for hydrogen–like ions has been described and implemented
previously into the Greens library (Koval and Fritzsche 2003); this code has been
used also for the computation of all transition amplitudes and (angle–diﬀerential) cross
sections as shown and discussed below.

2.4. Exact relativistic formulation of the two–photon amplitude

Eq. (14) displays the two–photon transition amplitude in terms of the (relativistic)
wave and Green’s functions of hydrogen–like ions. For the further evaluation of this
amplitude, we need to decompose both, the photon as well as the free–electron wave
functions into partial waves in order to make later use of the techniques of Racah’s
algebra. As discussed previously for the capture of electrons by bare, high–Z ions

8

(Surzhykov et al 2002a), we ﬁrst have to decide about a proper quantization axis (z–
axis) for this decomposition, depending — of course — on the particular process under
consideration. For the photoionization of atoms, the only really preferred direction of
the overall system is given by the photon momenta k1 = k2 = k which we adopt as the
quantization axis below. Then, the multipole expansion of the radiation ﬁeld reads as

As seen from the expansion (18), we can distinguish between diﬀerent multipole compo-
nents such as e1e1, e1m1, e1e2, and others owing to the symmetries of the two
vector spherical harmonics, i.e. due to the particular combination of the summation
indices L, L′, Λ, Λ′ in this expansion. In the second line of (18), however, the — electro–
magnetic — multipole matrix elements still contain the wave function ψpms(r) of the free
electron with well–deﬁned asymptotic momentum p. In another expansion, therefore,
we have to decompose it into partial waves to allow for a further simpliﬁcation of the
two–photon transition amplitude (18). Again, also the expansion of the free–electron
wave will depend on the choice of the quantization axis and requires — by using a
quantization along the photon momentum — that we have to carry out a rotation of
the space part of the electron wavefunction from the z–direction into the p–direction

which combines the various (large and small) components of the bound state, the Green’s
function as well as from the free–electron wave. In this notation, again, T = L, S and
a superscript T refers to the conjugate of T , i.e. T = L for T = S and vice versa.
In contrast to the angular integrals (23), the radial integrals (24) have to be computed
numerically. In the present work, all the required integrals for the two–photon transition
amplitudes (22) are calculated by using the Greens (Koval and Fritzsche, 2003) and
Racah (Fritzsche et al 2001) programs.

2.5. Electric dipole approximation

The transition amplitude (22) still describes the full interaction between the electron
and photon ﬁelds. With the explicit summation over all the multipoles of the photon
ﬁeld (16), it includes the so–called retardation eﬀects or non–dipole contributions. In
practice, however, the contributions from the higher multipoles decreases very rapidly
with L and may therefore be neglected; in fact, the computation of these contributions
also become rather tedious because of diﬃculties with a stable procedure for the 2–
dimensional radial integrals (24). In many cases, therefore, it seems justiﬁed to restrict
the summation in (22) to just the (dominant) electric dipole term with L = 1 and
Λ = L
1. This ’dipole approximation’ is valid if the photon wave length is much larger
1 where a0 is the Bohr radius. For the two–photon
than the size of the atom, i.e. ka0 ≪
ionization, this condition is well satisﬁed for most light ions with, say, Z < 30 and for
photon energies below of the one–photon ionization threshold.

±

From the general form (22) of the ionization amplitude, the electric dipole appro-
ximation is obtained by taking L = L′ = 1 and Λ, Λ′ = 0, 2 which — owing to the dipole
selection rules — then also restricts the summation over κf , i.e. the allowed partial
waves for the free electron. For the K–shell ionization with (completely) circularly
polarized light, for instance, the ﬁnal–state electron can only escape in the d3/2 or d5/2
states. And, as seen from Eq. (22), the dipole transition amplitude is then indeed
deﬁned by the (second–rank) spherical harmonic, Mbp(ms, µb, λ, λ)
Y2, µb−ms+2λ(ˆp)
which (together with Eq.(9)) leads us to the well–known angular distribution

∝

W circ(ˆp) = c4 sin4 θ

(25)

of the photoelectrons (Lambropoulos 1972, Arnous et al 1973). As expected from the
axial symmetry of the overall system ’ion plus photons’, the angular distribution (25)
only depends on θ but not on the azimuthal angle φ. For linearly polarized light, in
contrast, a reaction plane is naturally deﬁned by the photon momentum k and the pola-
rization vector u and, hence, the axial symmetry is broken. For a linear polarization
of the incident light, therefore, the angular distribution will depend on both, the polar
and azimuthal angle and is given by (Zernik 1964, Lambropoulos 1972)

W lin(ˆp) = b0 + b2 sin2 θ cos2 φ + b4 sin4 θ cos4 φ,

(26)

where the angle φ = 0 corresponds to an electron emission within the reaction plane [cf.
Figure 1].

Figure 2. Angular distributions of the emitted electrons in the two–photon K–
shell ionization of hydrogen–like ions by means of circularly, linearly and unpolarized
light. Results are presented for both, the electric dipole (– –) and the relativistic (—)
approximations and for a two–photon energy which is 40 % above the (one–photon)
ionization threshold.

3. Results and discussion

For the calculation of total two–photon ionization cross sections, the electric dipole
approximation was recently found suﬃcient for most of the hydrogen–like ions, and
not just in the low–Z domain (Koval et al 2003). Even for high–Z ions, for example,
the total cross sections from the dipole approximation do not diﬀer more than about
20 % from those of a full relativistic computation, including the contributions from
all the higher multipoles. Larger deviations, however, can be expected for the angular
distribution of the emitted electrons which is known to be sensitive to the retardation
in the electron–photon interaction (Surzhykov et al 2002b). As known, for instance,
from the radiative recombination of high–Z ions, which is the time–inverse process for
the one–photon ionization, a signiﬁcant change in the angle–diﬀerential cross sections
may arise from the higher multipoles and may lead to quite sizeable deviations when
compared with the dipole approximation (Eichler and Meyerhof 1995).

In this contribution, therefore, we have analyzed both, the electric dipole and
the exact relativistic treatment from Eq. (22) in order to explore the relativistic and
retardation eﬀects on the angular distributions of the electrons. Detailed computations
have been carried out, in particular, for the K–shell ionization of (neutral) hydrogen as
well as hydrogen–like xenon and uranium ions at an energy of both incoming photons

Figure 3. Angular distributions of the electrons emitted in the two–photon K–
shell ionization of the hydrogen–like uranium U 91+ by means of linear polarized light.
Distributions are shown for the angles φ = 0◦, 45◦ and 90◦ with respect to the reaction
plane; cf. Figure 1.

to explore the dependence of the relativistic eﬀects on the polarization of the incoming
light, three cases of the polarization are considered: (i) completely circular polarized,
(ii) completely linear polarized as well as the case of (iii) unpolarized light. For these
three ions and types of polarization, Figure 2 displays the angular distributions of
the electrons as obtained within the dipole approximation (– –) as well as the exact
relativistic treatment (—) which is given by Eqs.(22)–(24) and includes, therefore, all the
multipoles in the electron–photon interaction. While, for hydrogen, both approximation
virtually yields identical results, they start to diﬀer as the nuclear charge Z is increased.
Instead of a symmetrical emission with respect to the polar angle θ = 90◦, then the
emission occurs predominantly into forward direction, an eﬀect which is best seen for
hydrogen–like U 91+ ions. We therefore ﬁnd, that the non–dipole terms give ﬁrst of all
rise to an asymmetrical shift in the angular distribution of the electrons which could be
observed in experiment. The maxima in the (angle–diﬀerential) cross sections, on the
other hand, are less aﬀected and deviate, even for hydrogen–like uranium, less than a
factor of 2.

dσ

dΩ = dσ

In Figure 2, all angular distributions are shown as function of the polar angle θ,
i.e. with respect to the incoming photon beam. As discussed above, this dependence
dΩ (θ) , can be the only one for circular and
of the diﬀerential cross sections,
unpolarized light for which the electron emission must be axially symmetric. For linear
polarized light, in contrast, the emission of the electrons will depend on both, the polar
angle θ and the azimuthal angle φ. For this polarization, Figure 2 only displays the
angular distributions within the reaction plane, i.e. at φ = 0◦. To explore, in addition,
also the φ–dependence of the two–photon ionization by linear polarized light explicitly,
Figure 3 shows the corresponding angular distributions dσ
dΩ (θ, φ) for the three particular
angles φ = 0◦, 45◦ and 90◦ with respect to the reaction plane; here, the left inlet (φ
= 0◦) is the same as shown in Figure 2 in the middle column for U 91+ ions. Again,
the results from the electric dipole approximation are compared with those from a fully
relativistic computation. As seen from Figure 3, the most pronounced eﬀect of the
higher multipoles arise for an electron emission in a plane, which is perpendicular to the
photon polarization vector (φ = 90◦). In such a — perpendicular — geometry of the

Until now, we considered the two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions by
either completely polarized (linear: PL = 1; circular PC = 1) or unpolarized light
(PL = PC = 0).
In most experimental investigations on two– (and multi–) photon
processes, however, the incident radiation is typically polarized with some given degree
of polarization 0
1. Apart from the type of the polarization of the in-
coming light, therefore, we shall study also how the angular distributions depend on
the degree of polarization. Figure 4, for instance, displays the angular distribution from
shell ionization of hydrogen–like U 91+ ions by means of circular polarized light
the K
with a degree of polarization PC = 0.0 (unpolarized case), 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0. As seen
from this ﬁgure, the probability for an electron emission increases at angles around θ
= 60◦ but decreases (towards zero) in forward and backward direction as the degree
In particular the behaviour near θ = 0◦ and θ = 180◦
of polarization is increased.
can be easily explained if we consider the conservation of momentum in the overall
system. Since, for completely circularly polarized light, the (total) spin projection of
photons on the quantization axis (which is chosen along the photon momenta k) becomes
λ1 + λ2 =
2, it obviously can not be compensated – in the ﬁnal state – if the electron
is emitted parallel (or antiparallel) to the incoming light and hence its spin projection
1/2. For unpolarized light, in contrast, the photons may have diﬀerent
is µf = ms =
helicities and, therefore, the projection of their angular momentum λ1 + λ2 = 0 may be
conserved under a forward and backward non spin–ﬂip electron emission.

4. Summary

In this paper, the two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions has been studied in the
framework of second–order perturbation theory and the relativistic description of the
electron and photon ﬁelds. That is, exact Dirac bound and continuum wave functions
were applied for the description of the electron to reveal the importance of relativity
on the angular distributions of the emitted electrons. Moreover, relativistic Coulomb–
Green’s functions are used to perform the summation over the complete Dirac spectrum
as needed in second–order perturbation theory.

To understand the angular distributions of the emitted photoelectron and,
in
particular, the inﬂuence of the polarization of the light on this emission, density matrix
theory has been utilized to ’combine’ the two–photon transition amplitudes in a proper
way. Calculations are carried out for the K–shell ionization of the three (hydrogen–like)
ions H, Xe 53+ and U 91+. From the angular distribution of the electrons for diﬀerent
types (linear, circular, unpolarized) and degrees of polarization (i.e. in going from the
completely polarized to unpolarized light), it is clearly seen that the angular emission
depends much more sensitive on the contributions from higher multipoles than the total
cross sections. Two rather pronounced eﬀects, for example, concern the (asymmetrical)
forward emission of the electrons as well as a signiﬁcant change in the electron emission
for linear polarized light, if the electrons are observed perpendicular to the reaction plane
[cf. Figure 4]. Both eﬀects are enhanced if the nuclear charge of the ions is increased.

An even stronger inﬂuence from the non–dipole terms (of the radiation ﬁeld) is
expected for the spin–polarization of the photoelectrons. Similar as in the present
investigation, density matrix theory provides a very suitable tool for such polarization
studies. A detailed analysis of the polarization of the photoelectrons, emitted in the
two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions, is currently under work.

Appendix A. Photon spin density matrix

A pure (i.e. completely polarized) state of the photon can be characterized in terms
of a polarization unit vector u which always points perpendicular to the (asymptotic)
photon momentum k. Of course, this polarization vector, u, can be re–written by means
of any two (linear independent) basis vectors such as the circular polarization vectors
u±1 which are (also) perpendicular to the wave vector k and which, for u+1 respective
u−1, are associated with right– and left–circular polarized photons (Blum 81). In such

15

(A.1)

a basis, the unit vector for the linear polarization of the light can be written as

u(χ) =

e−iχ u+1 + eiχ u−1

,

1
√2

(cid:0)
where χ is the angle between u(χ) and the x–z plane.

(cid:1)

While a description of the polarization of the light in terms of either the circular
polarization vectors u±1 or the linear polarization vector (A.1) is appropriate for
completely polarized light, it is not suﬃcient to deal with an ensemble of photons which
have diﬀerent polarization. Such a — mixed — state of the light is then better described
in terms of the spin–density matrix. Since the photon (with spin S = 1) has only two
allowed spin (or helicity) states
1, the spin–density matrix of the photon
is a 2

2 matrix and, hence, can be parameterized by three (real) parameters:

Of course, the choice of the parameters PL, PC and χ is not unique and many other
— equivalent — sets of three real parameters could be applied to characterize the photon
spin density matrix (A.2). In the analysis of experimental data, for instance, one often
uses the three Stokes parameters to describe the polarization of radiation. The Stokes
parameters can easily be expressed in terms of the (two) degrees of polarization, PL and
PC, and the angle χ as:

P1 = PL cos 2χ,

P2 = PL sin 2χ,

Abstract

The positronium molecule (Ps2) has not been experimentally observed yet

because its tiny (4.5 eV) binding energy cannot be detected when the molecule

annihilates by emitting two photons with energy of 0.51 MeV each. It is shown

in this paper that the electric dipole transition between the recently found

L = 1 excited-state and the L = 0 ground-state with its characteristic photon

energy of 4.94 eV is a clear signature of the existence of the positronium

molecule and the possibility of its experimental observation is realistic. The

probability of this transition is about 17 % of the total decay rate. An other

Coulomb four-body system containing positron, HPs (the positronium hydride

or hydrogen positride), is also included for comparison.

I. INTRODUCTION

Despite the early theoretical prediction of its existence [1], the Ps2 molecule has not

been experimentally found to date. The diﬃculty stems from the fact that this system

is neutral and therefore it cannot be separated from the positronium atoms (Ps) and its

primary decay mode, the annihilation by two-photon emission, is exactly the same as that

of the Ps atom. The energy of the photons arising from the annihilation is diﬀerent in

principle: The photons carry 1.02 MeV energy due to the annihilation plus the binding

energy of the corresponding system. The binding-energy diﬀerence is, however, less than

1 eV and adding it to 1.02 MeV, the energy of the photons coming from the Ps atom or

Ps2 molecule cannot be experimentally distinguished. The experimental observation of the

biexcitons can be considered as an indirect indication of the existence of Ps2.

In our recent Letter [2] we have predicted the existence of a hitherto unknown bound

excited-state of the Ps2 molecule. In this paper we give a detailed description of this state.

We have investigated possible decay modes of this state with a special emphasis on the

electric dipole (E1) transition to the ground state. It will be shown that the probability

of the E1 transition is comparable to that of the annihilation. The unique energy of this

transition may possibly be utilized as a sign for the experimental identiﬁcation of the Ps2

The stochastic variational method [3,4] has been used to solve the Coulomb four-body

problem. In this method the variational trial functions are optimized by gambling: Ran-

domly chosen conﬁgurations are probed and most adequate functions are selected to be the

molecule.

basis states.

The Correlated Gaussians (CG) [5] are used as basis functions in this procedure. The CG

basis has a long history in atomic and molecular physics and highly accurate calculations

are based on this form of basis functions [2,6–10]. The angular part is given by the global

vector representation [7]. This approach greatly simpliﬁes the calculations for non-spherical

systems by replacing the partial wave expansion with a much simpler representation of the

2

angular motion.

The hydrogen positride (positronium hydride), HPs, has already been in the focus of

intensive theoretical and experimental investigation. This is an ideal system to test the

SVM. We compare the properties of the Ps2 and HPs molecules.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In sect. II we give a brief description of the trial

function and the stochastic variational method. In sect. III the results are presented. The

main results of the paper are summarized in sect. IV. In Appendices A-D we collect some

basic ingredients which are used in the present study in order to help readers reproduce our

results: formulae of the matrix elements in the CG basis, the separation of the center-of-

mass motion from the CG basis, the use of Sherman-Morrison formula in selecting nonlinear

parameters, and the symmetry requirement for the trial wave function of the Ps2 molecule.

II. THE CALCULATION

A system of two electrons with mass m and two positive unit charges of mass M is

considered. Their relative mass is characterized by the ratio σ = m/M, and the positronic

limit is realized by σ = 1. (Though we consider the case of σ = 1 in this paper, the extension

to other σ values is straightforward, so we give a formulation assuming an arbitrary mass

ratio.) The Hamiltonian of the system reads as

H =

where qi and ri are the charges and the position vectors of the particles. Particle labels 1 and

3 denote the positive charges, while labels 2 and 4 denote the negative charges. A relative

coordinate system is introduced by deﬁning x1 and x2 as the distance vectors between the

positive and negative charges in the ﬁrst and second atom, and x3 as the distance vector

between the center-of-masses of the two atoms:

is very popular in atomic and molecular physics [4–10]. Here ˜r stands for a one-row vector

whose ith element is ri. The merit of this basis is that the matrix elements are analytically

available and unlike other trial functions (for example, Hylleraas-type functions) one can

relatively easily extend the basis for the case of more than three particles. The well-known

defects of this basis are that it does not fulﬁll the cusp condition and its asymptotics does

not follow the exponential falloﬀ. This latter problem, especially for bound states, can be

cured by taking linear combinations of adequately chosen CGs.

The CG deﬁned above is spherical and can thus describe systems with only L = 0 orbital

angular momentum. The usual way to account for the orbital motion in the case of L

= 0

is the partial-wave expansion. Because of the complexities arising from the evaluation of

matrix elements this expansion gets very tedious for more than three particles. To avoid

this diﬃculty the global vector representation [7] is used. In this approach, one deﬁnes a

vector v as a linear combination of the relative coordinates:

and the non-spherical part of the wave function is represented by a solid spherical harmonic

The linear combination coeﬃcients ui are considered to be variational parameters and their

optimal values are to be determined by the SVM as will be discussed later. The details and

examples can be found in [7].

The calculation of the matrix elements for the space part of our basis function

fKLM (u, A, r) = GA(r)

YKLM (v)

(9)

is given in [7]. In the special case of K = 0 the matrix elements can be written in much

simpler form. This is shown in Appendix A. In the K

= 0 case, the CG is multiplied by

a polynomial of the relative coordinates. In some cases this might be very useful, it can

improve the short-distance behavior, for example, but this role can also be played by an

appropriate superposition of the exponentials. We use K = 0 in this paper.

The translational invariance of the wave function is ensured by requiring that the param-

eters A and u fulﬁll some special conditions. As is detailed in Appendix B, these conditions

ensure that the motion of the center-of-mass is factorized in a product form.

By combining the CG with the angular and spin parts, the full basis function takes the

form

ΦkLS =

χSMS fKLM (uk, Ak, r)

A{

(10)

with an appropriate spin function χSMS , where “k” is the index of the basis states and

is an

antisymmetrizer for the identical fermions. In the positronium limit (σ = 1) the Hamiltonian

becomes invariant with respect to the interchange of positive and negative charges. Therefore

the basis function should have a deﬁnite parity under the charge-permutation operator. See

Appendix D for the details of the symmetry requirement on the wave function. For the

special case with S = 0 and MS = 0 in which two spins of positive charges and two electron

spins are coupled to zero, respectively, the spin part of the wave function reads as

(12)

(13)

where αji (i < j) is assumed to be equal to αij. There are two reasons to choose this form.

The ﬁrst is that in choosing αij in this way we deal with a correlation function between the

particles i and j, while Aij has no such direct meaning and during the optimization it is

more diﬃcult to limit the numerical interval of Aij to be chosen from. Secondly, one can

utilize this speciﬁc form to make the individual steps of the parameter selection very fast.

By taking a look at the expressions of the matrix elements in Appendix A, it is clear that

the main computational load is the calculation of the inverse and determinant of the matrix

of the nonlinear parameters. The form in Eq. (44) oﬀers the possibility of the usage of the

Sherman-Morrison formula to calculate these quantities, leading to a much faster function

evaluation. The details of this step are given in Appendix C.

B. Electric dipole transition rate

In the positronium limit (σ = 1) we deal with antiparticles and the electron-positron

pair can annihilate. The lifetime of the ﬁrst excited-state with L = 1 and negative parity

is determined by both processes of annihilation and electric dipole transition to the ground

state. The width Γdipole for the latter process is calculated through the reduced transition

C. Annihilation rate

The most dominant annihilation of the ﬁrst excited-state of Ps2 is accompanied by the

emission of two photons with energy of about 0.5 MeV each. The decay width Γ2γ for the

annihilation can be estimated through the decay width ΓPs

2γ of the para-positronium in spin-

singlet state. This decay width has to be multiplied by the number N0 of positron-electron

pairs which are in spin-singlet state in the Ps2.

In the Ps2 excited state we have four

positron-electron pairs, among which the probability that the pair is in spin-singlet state is

1/4 because the total spin of the ﬁrst excited-state of Ps2 is zero, as will be shown later.

(1/4) = 1.) Therefore, to have an estimate for the decay due to the annihilation

(N0 = 4

D. The stochastic variational method

To obtain very precise energy, one has to optimize the variational parameters uki and

Akij of the trial function. The dimension of basis sets is typically between 100 and 1000,

7

and each basis state has nine nonlinear parameters. (See Appendix B.) The optimization of

a function with a few thousands nonlinear parameters cannot be done eﬃciently by using a

deterministic optimization method, since this could entail the complete reconstruction of the

Hamiltonian matrix and diagonalization every time when some of the nonlinear parameters

are altered. Moreover, the deterministic search for the optimal value of such a large number

of parameters is likely to get trapped in a local minimum.

A procedure based on the stochastic search for the best set of nonlinear parameters can

be programmed eﬃciently [4,11] and is capable of achieving highly accurate results for most

few-body systems [2,4,7,12]. The essence of the strategy can be summarized as follows: Let

(4) The procedure cycles through the diﬀerent parameter sets (

cessively choosing diﬀerent sets to minimize the energy until convergence is reached.

The essential reason motivating this strategy is the need to sample diﬀerent sets of nonlinear

parameters as fast as possible. The main advantage is that it is not necessary to recompute

the complete Hamiltonian nor it is necessary to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem

from scratch each time a new parameter set is generated. By changing the elements of

parameter set for each basis function individually, it is necessary to recompute only one row

(column) of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices each time the parameter set

ui, Ai}

{

is

changed. Furthermore, the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem is also expedited

since the Hamiltonian matrix is already diagonal apart from one row and one column.

A similar strategy to the above was used when adding additional terms to the basis.

8

The speed of the calculation can be further increased if one changes the nonlinear pa-

rameters Ai in a special way. This is described in Appendix C.

The above way of ﬁnding the best parameters is certainly very restricted. Even this

simple method gives very accurate energies. More sophisticated technique may give better

results in a smaller basis size.

III. RESULTS

The results of calculations for the ground state of HPs and Ps2 and the ﬁrst excited-state

of Ps2 are reported in this section. The ground states of HPs and Ps2 have already been

subject to intensive calculations and some of the results obtained before for these systems

serve as validation of the SVM. The calculation of the properties of the excited state of the

Ps2 is the primary focus of this paper. We have previously reported the energy of the ground

state of the Ps2 and predicted the existence of an excited state of this molecule. This paper

reports considerably improved energies by further optimization of the nonlinear parameters

of the basis. The further optimization and the increase of the basis dimension has produced

an improved wave function and we present diﬀerent properties of these systems by using that

wave function. We show the convergence of the binding energies and various expectation

values as a function of the dimension of the basis. The results in the tables are shown for

the basis dimensions of K = 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600. The basis has been subject of

intensive optimizations at these dimensions. Once the optimization at a given basis size has

been ﬁnished, new basis states have been added (each of them has been selected amongst

hundreds of random candidates) to reach the next basis size where the optimization is started

again. While the pattern of convergence is a very useful information about the accuracy of

the results, one has to keep in mind that this can be distorted by many extraneous factors.

This is because one cannot guarantee that the quality of these optimizations is the same.

We expect that the stochastic selection of the basis is close to be the optimal choice for

lower dimensions, but for large dimensions (K = 1200, 1600) the procedure becomes more

9

time consuming and we have less chance to ﬁnd the optimal parameters.

A. Hydrogen Positride, HPs

The boundness of the exotic molecule, HPs, has been known theoretically for many

years [13] and it has recently been created and observed in collisions between positrons and

methane [14]. The investigation of the stability of positronic atoms has been attracting much

attention because positrons can be used as a tool for positron-annihilation spectroscopy in

condensed matter physics. The HPs molecule is the simplest but ideal hydride to test the

SVM. It is also very intriguing to see the diﬀerence between the properties of Ps2 and HPs.

The energy calculated by SVM and by other methods are shown in Table I. The proton

mass is taken to be inﬁnite. The two electrons are assumed to be in spin-singlet state. The

spin states of the proton and the positron can be taken arbitrary. Our result, already at

the dimension of K = 200, is better than the previous calculations. The increase of the

basis size improves the energy further. The need of improved accuracy can be clearly seen

in Table II, where various expectation values are listed. The expectation value

r4
e−e−

, for

i

h

example, is much less accurate than the energy and it is considerably improved beyond the

dimension K = 200.

One can compare the expectation values of the separation distances of the particles in

the HPs to those in the H and Ps atoms. The average electron-positron distance is 3.48 a0

in HPs, which is slightly diﬀerent from that in the positronium atom (3 a0). The average

electron-proton distance in HPs and H is considerably diﬀerent (2.31 a0 and 1.5 a0). The

average distance between the two positive charges (3.66 a0) is much larger than that in the

H2 molecule (1.41 a0).

The correlation function deﬁned by

δ(ri −
gives more detailed information on a system than just various average distances. This

quantity can be calculated by using Eqs. (34) and (35). For the spherical wave function

10

with L = 0, C(r) is a function of r, that is, the monopole density, and for the L = 1 wave

function, it consists of two terms of monopole and quadrupole densities. Figure 1 displays

r2 C(r) for various pairs of the constituents of HPs. The two electrons are attracted by

the proton, but the proton-electron correlation function is much broader than that in the

H atom, while they are separated with its maximum density being at about 2.8 a.u. The

positron moves furthest from the proton and has a peak density around at 2.6 a.u. from the

electron.

B. Positronium molecule, Ps2: Ground state

The energies by SVM are compared to the best previous results in Table III. The result of

SVM, again, already at the dimension of K = 200, is better than the energy of the previous

calculations. The increase of the basis size improves the accuracy and the virial factor

The average electron-positron distance is 4.487 a0, which is about 1.5 times larger than

in the positronium atom. The 2γ annihilation rate calculated from Eq. (16) by using

of Table II is found to be Γ2γ = 4.470 ns−1.

The electron-electron and the electron-positron correlation functions are compared in

Fig. 2. The peak position of the electron-electron correlation function is shifted to larger

distances compared to the one of the electron-positron correlation function. The electron-

positron correlation function in Ps2 has much broader distribution than the corresponding

function in a Ps atom.

11

C. Positronium molecule, Ps2: First excited state

In our previous paper we have predicted the existence of the ﬁrst excited-state of the

Ps2 molecule. This is a unique bound-state which cannot decay into two Ps atoms due to

the Pauli principle. The spin of this state is S = 0 and the orbital angular momentum is

L = 1 with negative parity. In this spin state, the Ps2 molecule can dissociate into two Ps

atoms (bosons) only if the relative orbital angular momentum is even. Consequently, the

Ps2 molecule with L = 1 and negative parity cannot decay into the ground states of two

Ps atoms (Ps(L = 0)+Ps(L = 0)). The energy of this Ps2 (L = 1) state (E =

0.334408

a.u., see Table III) is lower than the energy of the relevant threshold (

−
0.3125 a.u.), and

−

this state is therefore stable against the autodissociation into Ps(L = 0)+Ps(L = 1). The

binding energy of this state is 0.5961 eV, which is by about 40% more than that of the

ground state of Ps2 (0.4355 eV).

We have shown in [2] that the bound excited state is essentially a system where two Ps

atoms, one in its ground state and the other in its ﬁrst excited P state, are weakly coupled.

The expectation value of the average electron-positron distance shown in Table V supports

this picture: The value of 7.57 a0 in the excited state is 15 % larger than the average (6.5

a0) of the electron-positron distances in the L = 0 ground state of the Ps atom (3 a0) and

the L = 1 excited state of the Ps atom (10 a0). We can also estimate the root-mean-square

distance d =

The symmetry properties of the Ps2 wave function are used to obtain the second equality.

Using the values of Tables IV and V yields d = 6.93 a.u. for the L = 1 excited state and

d = 4.82 a.u. for the L = 0 ground state.

Figure 3 displays the electron-electron and electron-positron correlation functions. As

mentioned before, the correlation function for the L = 1 state consists of the monopole and

quadrupole densities and their shapes depend on the magnetic quantum number M of the

12

wave function. Of course the M-dependence of the shapes is not independent of each other

but is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient. See Eq. (34). The quadrupole density

is contributed only from the P -wave for the electron-positron relative motion, while the

monopole density is contributed by both S- and P -waves. Figure 3(a) plots the correlation

functions for M = 0 and Fig. 3(b) the correlation functions for M = 1. As the correlation

function is axially symmetric around the z axis and has a reﬂection symmetry with respect

to the xy plane, the correlation function sliced on the xz plane is drawn as a function

of x (x

0), z (z

0). The electron-electron correlation function has a peak at the point

≥

≥

corresponding to the average distance of 7.57 a.u. The electron-positron correlation function

has two peaks reﬂecting the fact that the basic structure of the second bound-state is a

weakly coupled system of a Ps atom in the L = 0 state and another Ps atom in the L = 1

spatially extended state. The peak located at a larger distance from the origin is due to the

P -wave component of the Ps2 molecule.

By using the obtained value for

δ(r12)

in Eq. (16), the lifetime due to the annihilation

h

i

is estimated to be 0.44 ns. This is about twice of the lifetime of the Ps2 ground state. The

B(E1) value is calculated to be B(E1) = 0.87e2a2

0. By combining this value with the dipole

transition energy of 4.94 eV, the lifetime due to the electric dipole transition has been found

to be 2.1 ns. The branching of the electric dipole transition is thus about 17 % of the total

decay rate. Therefore, both branches contribute to the decay of the excited state of the Ps2

molecule. Its lifetime is ﬁnally estimated to be about 0.37 ns. The excitation energy of 4.94

eV found for the Ps2 is diﬀerent by 0.16 eV from the corresponding excitation energy (5.10

eV) of a Ps atom. This diﬀerence seems to be large enough to detect its existence, e.g. in

the photon absorption spectrum of the positronium gas.

We have used the Correlated Gaussians combined with the angular functions which are

speciﬁed by the global vector. Nonlinear parameters of the bases have been determined

by the stochastic variational method. We have considerably improved the results of the

previous calculations for the ground state of HPs and Ps2. In addition, we have calculated

various expectation values, correlation functions and other properties of the excited state of

the Ps2 molecule.

The excited state of the Ps2 molecule has the orbital angular momentum L = 1, the

spin S = 0, and negative parity. The excitation energy of the state is 4.941 eV, 0.596 eV

below the threshold of Ps(L = 0)+Ps(L = 1). Though this state is in the continuum of

Ps(L = 0)+Ps(L = 0) channel, it is stable against autodissociation into that channel because

of the Pauli principle. The main decay mode of this state is the annihilation emitting two

photons of about 0.5 MeV each which, except for the tiny binding-energy diﬀerence, is equal

to the photon energies of Ps atoms. The annihilation decay mode is not useful to conﬁrm

experimentally the existence of the Ps2 molecule. We have discussed a unique decay mode

of the excited state, the electric dipole transition to the ground state. The lifetime due to

the electric dipole transition has been calculated to be 2.1 ns, while the lifetime due to the

annihilation is 0.44 ns. The electric dipole transition can be used as a signal for experimental

conﬁrmation of the Ps2 molecule.

APPENDIX A: EVALUATION OF MATRIX ELEMENTS

In this appendix the matrix elements of the spatial part of the basis functions are given.

The method of calculation of these analytical expressions is detailed in Refs. [7,22]. The

main aim of this section is to convince the reader that the formulae are particularly simple

for the case of K = 0. The extension to a general N-body system is straightforward so that

we assume that the system contains N particles.

here are rotational invariant and thus the matrix elements are diagonal in LM. Note the

prime on f which is a reminder that the parameters in the ket and the bra may be diﬀerent.

The use of Eq. (21) in Eq. (23) leads to an expression that the matrix element is derived

from that between the generating functions, which becomes a function of parameters λ, e, λ′

and e′. Here the matrix element between the generating functions can be obtained easily by

To remove the center-of-mass contamination from the angular part, let us express the

global vectors v in terms of relative coordinates:

mass motion. These conditions ﬁx N + 1 nonlinear parameters among N(N + 1)/2 + N =

N(N +3)/2 parameters. For N = 4 there remain nine free parameters for each basis function.

APPENDIX C: SHERMAN-MORRISON FORMULA

As it is shown in Appendix A, the calculation of the matrix elements requires the evalu-

ation of the determinant and inverse of the matrix B. In the SVM process we probe many

18

random trials with diﬀerent matrices. Let us assume that we change the matrix A of non-

linear parameters in such a way that we change the parameter αij (i

= j) of the relative

motion between particles i and j to αij + λ but keep all other matrix elements unchanged.

This is certainly a very restricted way, but in this case the computer time required for the

evaluation of the matrix elements tremendously decreases. This change of αij produces the

following changes in the matrix A (see Eq. (13)):

Aij →

Aij −

λ, Aji →

Aji −

λ,

Aii →

Aii + λ, Ajj →

Ajj + λ.

(42)

It is easy to see that this change does not violates the conditions of Eq. (39). Thus the

wave function with this modiﬁcation is still translational invariant. The above change in the

matrix A can be simply expressed by using the vector w(ij) deﬁned in Eq. (30) as follows:

Note that w(ij)

w(ij) is an N

N matrix, whereas

g
w(ij)w(ij) is just a number. As B is equal

to A + A′, the above change leads to the following modiﬁcation of B,

Charge symmetry

The Hamiltonian H for Ps2 has charge-exchange symmetry, that is, it is invariant under

the exchange of the positive and negative charges: Letting P denote the charge-permutation

operator, we have

HP ψ = P Hψ = EP ψ.

(58)

Therefore, the non-degenerate eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is also the eigenstate of the

charge-permutation operator. In the Ps2 the ground state is even (π = +1) under P , while

the L = 1 excited state turns out to be odd (π =

1).

−

Consider the case of Ps (e+e−). This system is represented by the coordinate (r2 −
The charge permutation is thus equivalent to the parity operation. Since the parity is

r1).

(

1)L for the state with orbital angular momentum L, the eigenvalue of charge-permutation

−
operator is also (

−

1)L. The signs of x1 and x2 change with respect to the charge permutation

P12P34, while x3 does not. Assume that the Ps2 has partial waves l1, l2 and l3 corresponding

to the motion described with x1, x2 and x3, respectively. When charges are permutated,

the wave function ψ become (

1)l1(

1)l2ψ. Then P ψ = ψ for the S state with l1 = l2 = 0,

−

−

while P ψ =

ψ for the P state with l1 = 0 and l2 = 1.

−

The non-vanishing matrix element of the electric dipole transition supports that the ﬁrst

excited P -state is odd under the charge permutation. This is because the electric dipole

operator D has the following form except for the constant:

D = e(r1 −

R)

e(r2 −

R) + e(r3 −

−

R)

e(r4 −

−

R),

(59)

which changes sign under the charge permutation. Therefore, if the excited P -state is even

under the charge permutation, then the electric dipole matrix element between the P state

and the ground state would identically vanish.

The charge-permutation operator P is given by P12P34 or P14P32. When the wave function

ψ is already antisymmetrized for two positrons and for two electrons, then we can see that

both operators give the same eﬀect. To understand this we use the following identity

22

P14P32ψ = (P12P34)2P14P32(P13P24)2ψ = P12P34P13P24ψ = P12P34ψ.

(60)

Thus the basis function for the Ps2 molecule with deﬁnite charge-permutation symmetry is

given by operating with the following operator

on the function:

Fig. 3 : The correlation functions r2C(r) (r = (x, 0, z)), multiplied by one thousand, for

the bound excited-state of the Ps2 molecule which has the orbital angular momentum

L = 1, the spin S = 0, and negative parity. The magnetic quantum number M is set

equal to 0 for (a) and to 1 for (b). Plotted on the xz plane are the contour maps of

the correlation function.

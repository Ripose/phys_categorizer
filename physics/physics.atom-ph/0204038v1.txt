Abstract

Pulsed ﬁeld ionization of high-n (90 ≤ n ≤ 150) manifold states in Rb Rydberg
atoms has been investigated in high slew-rate regime. Two peaks in the ﬁeld ioniza-
tion spectra were systematically observed for the investigated n region, where the
ﬁeld values at the lower peak do not almost depend on the excitation energy in the
manifold, while those at the higher peak increase with increasing excitation energy.
The fraction of the higher peak component to the total ionization signals increases
with increasing n, exceeding 80% at n = 147. Characteristic behavior of the peak
component and the comparison with theoretical predictions indicate that the higher
peak component is due to the tunneling process. The obtained results show for the
ﬁrst time that the tunneling process plays increasingly the dominant role at such
highly excited nonhydrogenic Rydberg atoms.

Rydberg atoms have been utilized in fundamental physics research, such as
in the ﬁeld of cavity quantum electrodynamics[1]. Area of their application
ﬁelds has recently been more enhanced with the development of the quantum
computing and its related quantum measurements[2]. In these experimental
studies, the ﬁeld ionization method has been widely used for the detection
of highly excited atoms. Most applications of Rydberg states up to now have
been performed by using alkali atoms with the principal quantum number
n less than 60 or so and it is known in this region that the ﬁeld ionization
occurs mostly around the classical saddle-point ﬁeld-value given by Fc = W 2/4
(in a.u.), where W is the binding energy of the Rydberg states. There often
observed are two peaks in the ﬁeld ionization spectra due to the adiabatic and
non-adiabatic processes in the time evolution of the Rydberg atoms in the
electric ﬁeld[4,5]. This ionization is due to the level mixing in the ionic core
of the bound blue state with the continuum red states coming down from the
higher n states(autoionization-like process) [3–5]. This ﬁeld ionization due to
the level mixing eﬀect occurs at the ﬁeld region between the classical saddle
point value and the value expected from the tunneling process[4,5]. At the low
n (less than ∼ 60) region, the ionization due to the tunneling process has not
been observed usually in nonhydrogenic atoms because the ionization due to
the autoionization-like process has much shorter ionization-lifetime than that
from the tunneling process (see, however, Neijzen and D¨onszelmann[6] and
Rolfes, Smith and MacAdam[7]).

Since the level mixing in the ionic core interior is weaker with increasing n
by a factor of n2, it is naturally expected that the competition between the
autoionization-like and the tunneling processes occurs at some n region and
thereafter the tunneling process will dominate the ionization process. To our
best knowledge, no detailed investigations have been reported for the ﬁeld ion-
ization behavior in highly excited Rydberg atoms with n higher than 70. In
addition to the above intrinsic interests in the physics of pulsed ﬁeld ionization
mechanism in highly excited Rydberg atoms, such studies are inevitably im-
portant to extend the applications of the Rydberg atoms to still higher excited
region where the coupling to the external electromagnetic ﬁeld is increasingly
stronger and thus open new areas of application ﬁelds.

We report here the experimental results of the detailed systematic investiga-
tion of ﬁeld ionization behavior of the highly excited Rb Rydberg states with
n ranging from 90 to 150. Speciﬁcally we focussed on the high-n manifold
states which are degenerate in energy at zero electric ﬁeld except for some
low angular-momentum (ℓ) states, but are split under the electric ﬁeld. Af-
ter exciting these splitting manifold states from a low-lying 5p3/2 state with
lasers under a small electric ﬁeld, pulsed electric ﬁeld was applied to ionize the
states in high slew rate regime. It was found for the ﬁrst time that the tunnel-
ing process is increasingly the dominant process in the pulsed ﬁeld ionization
at such highly excited Rydberg atoms. Here the systematic occurrence of the

tunneling process and comparison of the results with theoretical predictions
are presented and discussed with applications of such highly excited Rydberg
states.

Schematic diagram of the present experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. A
thermal atomic beam of Rb was introduced at the center of the ﬁeld ionization
electrodes, where the 85Rb atoms in the ground state 5s1/2 were excited to the
Rydberg manifold states through the second excited 5p3/2 state by the two-step
laser excitation. A diode laser (780 nm) and a dye laser (479 nm) with a dye of
coumarin 102 pumped by a Kr ion laser were used for the ﬁrst and second step
excitations, respectively. The polarizations of the laser lights adopted in the
present experiment are parallel and perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld applied
for the ﬁrst and the second lasers, respectively 3 .

A linearly ramped electric ﬁeld was applied for the ﬁeld ionization in the
present experiment. For this purpose a sequence of voltage pulse was generated
by a waveform generator AWG420 (Sony Tektronix) and ampliﬁed by fast
ampliﬁers before applying to the electrodes. The electrodes consist of two
parallel plates of 52 mm length and 40 mm width, the distance between them
being 24 mm.

The electrons liberated by the ﬁeld ionization were guided to a channel electron
multiplier through two ﬁne-mesh grids placed in one of the electrode plates.
Ionization signals of electrons from the channel electron multiplier were am-
pliﬁed by a preampliﬁer and a main ampliﬁer and then fed to a multichannel
scaler P7886 (FAST ComTek) after the pulse height discrimination. The ion-
ization events were counted as a function of the elapsed time from the starting
time of the ramp ﬁeld with the dwell time of 500ps. From the correspondence

3 No appreciable change in the experimental results was observed, however, with
other conﬁgurations such as both parallel and perpendicular cases.

Fig. 2. Relevant Stark energy diagram and ﬁeld ionization spectra for the 112
manifold states. Only every one of three states in the split n=112 Stark manifold
states are shown for clarity. Dotted and solid lines are the theoretical predictions of
the ionization threshold values expected from the classical saddle point ionization
(Fc) and from the tunneling process (Ft), respectively. The manifold states were
initially populated under the static electric ﬁeld of 75 mV/cm, and subsequently
ionized with a pulsed electric ﬁeld at the slew rate of 13.4 V/(cm·µs). Here Wr is
a parameter representing the excitation position of the manifold states in which
the values +1.0 and -1.0 correspond to the uppermost (highest energy) and the
lowermost (lowest energy) states, respectively.

of the applied electric ﬁeld and the time bin, the observed timing spectra were
converted into the ﬁeld ionization spectra as a function of the applied electric
ﬁeld.

The manifold states were excited under a small electric ﬁeld applied. The ap-
plied ﬁeld was set to ∼ 0.7Fe, where Fe(= 1/3n5) is the ﬁeld at which n and
n ± 1 manifolds cross ﬁrst. This ﬁeld is larger than the ﬁrst avoided-crossing
ﬁeld between the p state and the adjacent manifold in 85Rb, and yet smaller
than Fe. It is noted here that the manifold states can be excited from the
low-lying p state only under the electric ﬁeld because they are intrinsically
high ℓ states in zero ﬁeld. Even under the electric ﬁeld, however, the extreme
states near the bluest and the reddest states are hard to be excited appre-

ciably, thus being unable to be used as a reference to the excitation position
of the manifold states. Precise position of the excited states in the manifold
was therefore determined from the wavelength diﬀerence of the second laser
relative to the excitation of s and p states at the applied electric ﬁeld. For
this purpose, exact excitation energies of the s and p states, which already
enter into the manifold and thus not being well separated from the manifold
states, were evaluated from the calculated excitation energies at which the s
and d components in their wave functions have maxima among the close-lying
manifold states. The Stark energy structure calculated with the method of
Hamiltonian diagonalization[8] is shown to be precise enough for this purpose
even for such high-lying states[9].

Typical ﬁeld ionization spectra measured at the n = 112 manifold with slew
rate 13.4V/(cm·µs) are shown in Fig. 2. There observed are two prominent
peaks, the higher one of which moves appreciably in its ﬁeld ionization value
with the excitation position in the manifold, while the lower one of which
shows almost no dependence on the excitation position in the manifold.

Observed values of the ionization ﬁeld corresponding to the higher peak are
plotted in Fig. 3 for the two cases of n as a function of the excitation position
Wr in the manifold. Here the excitation position Wr in the manifold with its
binding energy W is expressed by

Wr = 2 W −Wmin
Wmax−Wmin

− 1,

where Wmax and Wmin are the binding energies of the uppermost (bluest state)
and the lowermost (reddest state) energy states in the manifold, respectively.

Also shown in this ﬁgure with dotted and dashed lines are the theoretical
predictions of the ionization ﬁeld from the tunneling process; the expected
ionization ﬁeld from this process was calculated with a semi-empirical formula
of ionization rate in the electric ﬁeld by Damburg and Kolosov[10]. Although
this formula was originally developed for Hydrogen and less accurate in its
prediction of ionization lifetime compared to the density-of-state method by
Luc-Koenig and Bachelier[11], Damburg and Kolosov prediction for the ion-
ization ﬁeld is considered to be accurate enough for the present purpose.

The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental re-
sults if the ionization paths under the applied pulsed electric ﬁeld from the
respective excitation positions are along the diabatic trajectories in the Stark
energy diagram as shown by thick solid lines with arrows in Fig. 2. This agree-
ment was found to be well satisﬁed for all the investigated Rydberg states with
90 ≤ n ≤ 150.

The fraction of the higher peak component to the total ionization signals
is shown in Fig.4 as a function of n. The fraction increases with increasing

n, exceeding 80 % at n = 147. This trend is consistent with the theoretical
expectation that the level-mixing (autoionization-like process) is less eﬀective
with increasing n.

Another important experimental result is that this fraction of tunneling pro-
cess increases with higher slew rate as shown in Fig. 5. This feature is also
consistent with the theoretical prediction that the ﬁeld ionization due to the
autoionization-like process has ﬁnite lifetime which depends on the electric
ﬁeld applied[9]; steeper the applied electric ﬁeld pulse, shorter time is allowed
for the atoms to be ionized with this autoionization-like process, thus induc-
ing relative increase of the fraction of the ionization component due to the
tunneling process.

These observations are the ﬁrst clear indications of the systematic occurrence
of the tunneling process in these highly excited nonhydrogenic Rydberg atoms
with n ≥ 90. Previously two groups[6,7] observed a ﬁeld ionization peak due
to the tunneling process for the 66p (2P ) state in In and 34d state in Na.

Finally we comment on the lower peak behavior. Contrary to the clear behavior
of the higher peak component from the tunneling process, the lower peak can
not be explained simply from the expected behavior of the autoionization-
like process; if the ionization path follows the same diabatic line as in the
case of higher peak component (tunneling process), the ionization ﬁeld would
depend on the excitation position of the manifold states, approximately given
by the crossing point between the line Fc and each straight line of diabatic
trajectory in Stark energy diagram as shown in Fig.2. This is not the case in
the actual situation as shown in the present experiment. The behavior is rather
consistent with that expected from the assumption that the initial manifold
states take adiabatic paths to ionization at the classical saddle point values Fc,
although the slew rate of the electric ﬁeld pulse applied actually is too high for
allowing the adiabatic paths in the individual avoided crossings. More detailed

the lower peak component will be presented elsewhere.

In conclusion we have studied the pulsed ﬁeld ionization behavior of highly
excited Rb Rydberg atoms in high slew rate regime. Speciﬁcally we focussed
on the ﬁeld ionization behavior of the manifold states in high n region. It was
found for the ﬁrst time that the tunneling process plays increasingly the domi-
nant role for the ﬁeld ionization at such highly excited nonhydrogenic Rydberg
atoms with n ranging from 90 to 150. The fraction of the ionization component
from the tunneling process increases with increasing slew rate. This behavior
brings us an important application of high-lying Rydberg atoms to serve as
a sensitive microwave single-photon detector over the 10-cm wavelength re-
gion[12]; in this new method, two low-ℓ states which lie below and above
the adjacent manifold, respectively, are selected as the lower and the upper
states for the Rydberg-atom microwave detector. The lower state initially pre-

7

pared (the upper state populated by absorbing photons) is then transferred
to the lowermost (uppermost) state in the adjacent manifold adiabatically.
The resulting extreme states in the manifold are then selectively ionized with
the following pulsed electric ﬁeld in high slew rate regime. The method was
demonstrated to be quite stringent in selectivity for the highly excited Rb
Rydberg atoms[13].

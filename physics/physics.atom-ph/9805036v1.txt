Abstract

The probability that an atom of hydrogen, initially in the 5g(m = 4) state,
survives a 90-fs pulse of 620 nm wavelength is calculated both by direct inte-
gration of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation and by a Floquet calcu-
lation. The two methods give virtually identical results. The survival proba-
bility calculated for a one-electron model of neon, for the same initial state,
pulse duration and wavelength, is in fair quantitative agreement with the
experimental data of van Druten et al. [Phys. Rev. A 55, 622 (1997)].

To be published in Physical Review A, June 1998

As is well known, Fermi’s golden rule predicts that an atom irradiated by a weak laser
ﬁeld decays by photoionization at a rate proportional to the intensity of the ﬁeld if the
photons energy exceeds the binding energy. This simple perturbative result is true, how-
ever, only at low intensity.
It is now widely accepted that the rate of ionization in an
intense high-frequency laser ﬁeld increases less rapidly with intensity than a linear power
law, and may even decrease above a certain critical intensity (before increasing again at
ultra-high intensity when the coupling with the magnetic ﬁeld of the incident wave becomes
important). This remarkable reduction in the photoionization rate is often referred to as
“adiabatic stabilization”, even though the atom never becomes completely stable against
photoionization, because the quasi-stationary wave packet describing the atom at high in-
tensity can be traced adiabatically to its ﬁeld-free, initial state; in particular, its formation
does not depend critically on fast variations of the intensity [1].

Adiabatic stabilization was ﬁrst studied in depth in the late 1980s, by M. Gavrila, M.
Pont and co-workers [2], and subsequently by many others. Numerical calculations focused
initially on the stabilization of the ground state or low-excited states of hydrogen or model
systems [3]. These were extended in 1991 and later to the analysis of atoms initially in
an excited state with a high magnetic quantum number with respect to the polarization
direction [4]. While results interpreted by several authors as casting doubts on the existence
of the eﬀect were also reported [5], the numerical calculations in general showed that the
ionization rate indeed decreases at suﬃciently high intensity. In particular, the calculations
for atoms initially prepared in an excited circular state (|m| = l ≈ n − 1 ≫ 1) demonstrated
stabilization at intensities, frequencies and pulse durations that could be achieved in the
laboratory. This prompted two experiments — the only experimental test of adiabatic

1

stabilization so far — in which the photoionization of the 2p55g(m = 4) state of neon was
studied at a wavelength of 620 nm and intensities up to 2.3 × 1014 W/cm2 [6,7]. Onset of
stabilization was observed at high intensity, and, to the extent that a comparison could be
made, the experimental results were found to be consistent with the results of calculations
done at the same wavelength for the 5g(m = 4) state of hydrogen.

The present work aims at a closer comparison of theory with the experimental data of
Ref. [7]. The quantities measured in the experiment (the yield in photoelectrons and the
residual populations at the end of the pulse) can be calculated, for a simpliﬁed model of the
atom, either by direct integration of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation or by treating
the system as being quasi-stationary and using Floquet methods. We ﬁrst show that, in the
present case, these two approaches give virtually identical results.

Both the Floquet and the time-dependent calculations were performed in the dipole ap-
proximation, with the ﬁeld described by the vector potential A(t) = A0(t) sin ωt ˆz. For
A0 constant and with Siegert boundary-conditions imposed on the wave function, the
quasienergy of the (Floquet) dressed state, E,
is a complex eigenvalue of a system of
time-independent diﬀerential equations. We solved this system numerically in the veloc-
ity gauge, using a basis of spherical harmonics and complex radial Sturmian functions [8].
The quasienergy was also obtained by Pad´e-summing its Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbative
expansion in powers of the intensity. In the high frequency regime, the latter technique gives
the same results as a full non-perturbative calculation for a small fraction of the cost in CPU
time. The rate of photoionization, Γ = −2 Im (E/¯h), does not depend on the normalization
of the Floquet wave function and is a function of the vector potential amplitude, A0, and of
the other parameters of the incident ﬁeld. The variation of the ionization rate with intensity
is shown in Fig. 1, for the dressed 5g(m = 3) and 5g(m = 4) states of hydrogen at 620
nm wavelength: Γ increases in proportion of the intensity in weak ﬁelds, in agreement with
the golden rule, but eventually reaches a maximum and then decreases monotonically as
stabilization sets in. The maximum occurs at a higher intensity for m = 3 than for m = 4,
as is discussed in Ref. [4d]. Note that in Fig. 1, Γ remains small compared to the inverse
of a laser period, ω/2π = 0.012 a.u., and can therefore be interpreted in the usual sense, as
a cycle-averaged ionization rate. The process being non-resonant, one may expect that the
atom follows the dressed states adiabatically if A0 varies slowly instead of being constant.
Our Floquet calculations thus relied on representing the atom by a single dressed state, i.e.
the one that develops from the unperturbed initial state as A0 increases. Accordingly, the
probabilities that the atom survives a (not too short) laser pulse and is left in its original
state, Psurv, or that it is photoionized, Pion, were taken to be

Psurv = exp

and Pion = 1 − Psurv (thus neglecting excitation of other dressed states).

The method used for numerically integrating the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation,
for atomic hydrogen, has been described in Ref. [9]. Brieﬂy, the wave function, represented on
a basis of spherical harmonics and (real or complex) radial Sturmian functions, is propagated
in time using a very stable predictor-corrector algorithm based on implicit Runge-Kutta
methods. The photoionization yield is obtained as the complement to unity of the population
remaining bound to the nucleus at the end of the pulse, which is calculated by projection

2

on all atomic bound states with n ≤ 25 and l ≤ 18. When using real Sturmians, the
basis must span a region of space large enough to contain the wave packet until the end of
the pulse. Much smaller bases are suﬃcient when employing complex Sturmians, as they
smoothly absorb the outgoing ﬂux before it leaves the region where the atom is represented
accurately. The results quoted below have been obtained by using complex bases, of typically
15 spherical harmonics (with ℓ varying from 4 to 18) and, for each partial wave, 120 complex
radial Sturmians. We have veriﬁed that at high ﬁeld intensity, 2 × 1014 W/cm2, identical
results (to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures) are obtained with a large basis of 600 real Sturmians
per angular momentum and 50 angular momenta.

In order to compare the Floquet and the time-dependent methods, we calculated the
probability that an hydrogen atom, initially in the 5g(m = 4) state with respect to the
polarization direction, is ionized by a 120-cycle pulse. The pulse duration (90 fs, FWHM in
intensity) was the same as in the experiment. For convenience, its envelope was taken to
be A0(t) = A0 sin2(t/τ ) [10]. The results are shown in Table I. Only insigniﬁcant (< 0.0001
%) residual populations in bound states other than the 5g state were found in the time-
dependent calculation. Adiabatic stabilization manifests by a decrease in the ionization
probability above about 1 × 1014 W/cm2 peak intensity. The decrease is less pronounced in
the ionization probability than in the ionization rate, but is still remarkable. Also noteworthy
is the 4-digit agreement between the Floquet results and the time-dependent results. The
agreement is better than had been previously reported for much shorter pulses [11].
It
conﬁrms that the one-state Floquet approximation is reliable for describing ionization in
high frequency pulses, and makes it possible to assign, unambiguously, the reduction in the
ionization probability observed in the time-dependent results to adiabatic stabilization [12].
The probability that the atom remains in the original 5g(m = 4) state is also the same
in the two methods, since there is no net population transfer to other bound states. This
is illustrated by Fig. 2. The ﬁgure also gives the survival probability for a pulse of same
width as above but with a sech2 intensity proﬁle: the probability is a little smaller for
the sech2-pulse than for the ﬁnite-duration pulse because for the same ﬂuence the former
irradiates the atom at (relatively) weak intensities for a longer time compared to the latter.
A simple calculation shows that for a ﬁxed pulse length and increasing ﬂuence, the survival
probability tends asymptotically to a constant smaller than 1 for a sech2-pulse, assuming of
course adiabaticity and a continuing decrease of Γ at high intensity. However, it decreases
to zero for pulses with, for example, a Lorentzian proﬁle or increases to 1 for ﬁnite-duration
pulses. Thus adiabatic stabilization (the decrease in the ionization rate) does not necessarily
translate into a decrease in the ionization probability.

We now compare our theoretical results with the experimental data. We model the neon
atom by a single electron moving in a central potential, V (r), that accounts for the partial
screening of the nuclear attraction by the inner electronic shells. In atomic units [13],

V (r) = −

where the parameters α1 = 13.06, α2 = 7.2 and α3 = 3.68 were obtained by ﬁtting the

Not surprisingly, the short-range part of V (r) is of very little importance for states with
m = 3 or 4. The rates of ionization from the dressed 5g(m = 3) and 5g(m = 4) states of
the model atom are within 0.02 % and 0.0005 %, respectively, from those based on a pure
Coulombic potential (shown in Fig. 1).

The fraction of the atomic population left in the initial state at the end of a 90-fs pulse
is shown in Fig. 3. The surviving fraction was measured directly in the experiment, and was
also estimated indirectly as the complement to unity of the measured ionized fraction. The
two sets of data are consistent and do not follow the rapid decrease at high ﬂuence that a
naive application of the golden rule would predict (see the dotted line in the ﬁgure, or Fig.
8 of Ref. [7]). The solid line in Fig. 3 represents the result of the Floquet calculation for the
sech2-pulse of above. We assumed a uniform distribution of intensity since in the experiment
the target atoms were prepared in the initial excited state only in the central part of the 620
nm beam. We also assumed that the system was initially in a pure 5g(m = 4) state while in
the experiment the atoms were initially in a superposition of several correlated states with a
small (at most 13 %) admixture of states having a 5g(m = 3) character. The importance of
this admixture was tested by repeating the calculation for an incoherent superposition of the
5g(m = 4) and 5g(m = 3) states in a 87 % / 13 % ratio. The resulting survival probability,
represented by the dashed line, is smaller than for the pure 5g(m = 4) state, since ionization
proceeds faster from the m = 3 state, but the diﬀerence is minor. As seen from the ﬁgure,
the calculated probabilities and the data are in fair quantitative agreement. This, of course,
tails well with the conclusion of van Druten el al. [7], that the large survival probability at
high ﬂuence observed in the experiment can be attributed to adiabatic stabilization.

in many of these time-dependent calculations transfer of population to dressed excited
states caused by the very fast pulse turn-on may be partly responsible for this decrease.

[12] Interference stabilization, which occurs when the widths of adjacent Rydberg states
overlap, does not play any role in the present case, since the ionization width of the

that the time-dependent wave function remains very close to the Floquet wave function
during the entire pulse. A detailed comparison of these wave functions, for various pulse
durations, will be reported elsewhere by the authors.

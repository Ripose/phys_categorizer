Abstract. For some values of the constituent masses mi, the hydrogen-like
molecule (m+
4 ) is stable with respect to spontaneous dissocia-
tion into two neutral atoms, while none of its three-body subsystems such
as (m+
3 ) is stable. This occurs in particular in the neighbourhood of
the (M +, m+, M −, m−) conﬁguration with M/m = 2, as for instance for the
molecule (p, d, ¯p, ¯d) involving an antiproton and an antideuteron.

The word “Borromean” is often used to identify bound states whose subsys-
tems are unbound [1]. It comes after the Borromean rings, which are interlaced
in such a subtle topological way, that if any one of them is removed, the two
others become unlocked. For instance, the 6He isomer of ordinary Helium is
stable, while 5He is not. In a three-body picture, this means that the (α, n, n)
system is bound, while neither (α, n) nor (n, n) are stable against dissociation.
For short-range forces, Borromean binding occurs explicitly in simple
quantum-mechanical models. Let g be the strength of the pair potential V act-
ing between N identical particles and containing attractive parts. Binding two
bosons requires a certain minimum strength, say g > g2. For three bosons, this
is g > g3. The remarkable observation is that g3 < g2. Typically, g3 ≃ 0.8 g2
for simple monotonic potentials such as Yukawa, Gaussian, exponential, etc.
See, e.g., [1], and references therein. It can be proved that g3/g2 ≥ 2/3 [1].
This lower limit is approached for potentials with an external barrier, whereas
g3/g2 → 1 for those with a strong repulsive core [1]. Similarly g4 < g3, etc.
A 4-body system is Borromean for g4 < g < g2, if one adopts the following
deﬁnition: A bound state is Borromean if there is no path to build it via a
series of stable states by adding the constituents one by one.

The phenomenon of Borromean binding is intimately linked to the Thomas
collapse [2] and the Eﬁmov eﬀect [3]. Let EN be the ground-state energy of
HN . For g → g2+, E2/E3 → 0, thus if E2 is kept ﬁxed by rescaling, E3 → −∞.

Figure 1. Geometrical representation of the stability domain for 3-body systems
(m+
3 ) represented by their normalised inverse masses αi. The arrows indicate
the range explored by the 3-body subsystems of [(A ± ǫ)+, a+, (A ∓ ǫ)−, a−] and
[A+(a ± η)+, A−(a ∓ η)−], for inverse masses in ratio a/A = 2. Here ǫ = 0.1 and
η = 0.25, but the stability border is drawn without accurate computation.

The occurrence of many excited states near g = g2 implies that the ground
state already exists at this point.

Borromean binding is hardly conceivable for long-range attractive poten-
tials. For the gravitational V (r) ∝ −1/r potential, the critical strength is
gN = 0, ∀N , by scaling considerations. The situation is less obvious for a
superposition of attractive and repulsive terms, and diﬀerent masses. Still the
existence of a bound state survives any overall rescaling of the strength factors
or masses, but depends rather crucially on the balance between the repulsive
and attractive terms, and on the mass ratios.

The systems of three unit charges have been studied extensively. See,
e.g., [4] for a comprehensive review. While He+(e−, p, p), Ps−(e+, e−, e−), and
H−(p, e−, e−), for instance, are stable against dissociation into a neutral atom
and an isolated charge, conﬁgurations such as (e−, e+, p) or (p, ¯p, e−) are un-
stable. Only coulomb forces are considered here, and ﬁnite-size eﬀects, strong
interaction, annihilation, etc., are neglected. The stability frontier is shown in
Fig. 1. Thanks to scaling, any state is represented by its normalised inverse
masses αi = m−1
k . The domain α1 + α2 + α3 = 1, αi > 0, is lim-
ited by an equilateral triangle, see Fig. 1. There is a stability band around the
symmetry axis, in between two instability domains which are convex [4].

i / Pk m−1

The (m∓, M ±, m±) conﬁgurations have been studied in some detail. They
correspond to the oblique symmetry axes in Fig. 1. For m = M , one gets the
stable Ps−. For M ≫ m, (e−, p, e+) is unstable. For M ≪ m, (p, e−, ¯p) is also
unstable. The stability range has been estimated by Mitroy [5],

There are fewer rigorous or empirical results on (m+

tems with charges {qi} = {±1, ±1, ∓1, ∓1}. Still, valuable information ex-
ists in the literature [4]. The conﬁguration (p, e+, ¯p, e−) is unstable, as it

cannot compete with the deeply bound protonium associated with the low-
est threshold (p, ¯p) + (e+, e−). On the other hand, the hydrogen molecule
H2(p, p, e−, e−), the positronium molecule Ps2(e+, e+, e−, e−), the positronium
hydride PsH(p, e+, e−, e−) are known to be stable. Any conﬁguration with two
identical particles, e.g., m3 = m4, are stable against spontaneous dissociation.
In particular, any hydrogen-like state (M +, M +, m−, m−) is stable with respect
to its lowest threshold 2(M +, m−), with stability improved if M/m is increased
or decreased, starting from the Ps2 case M/m = 1 [4]

The above examples share a common property: Ps2 contains the (e±, e∓, e∓)
subsystem, which possesses a stable bound stable; for H2, both (e−, p, p)
and (p, e−, e−) have at least one stable bound state. For PsH, (e−, e+, p)
is unstable, but (p, e−, e−) and (e+, e−, e−) have a stable bound state.
Any (m+
2 , m−, m−) state is stable, with at least (m+
1 , m−, m−) and
(m+
2 , m−, m−) having a stable bound state. It is tempting at this point to
conjecture that any stable molecule has at least one stable 3-body subsystem,
i.e., can be build step by step with stable intermediate states: single charge,
atom, and 3-body ion.

1 , m+

This conjecture is wrong, as can be seen by examining the second set of
N = 4 conﬁgurations with two masses. This is (M +, m+, M −, m−), which is
invariant under charge conjugation. For M ≫ m or M ≪ m, it corresponds to
the unstable (p, e+, ¯p, e−), while for M = m, it leads to a rescaled Ps2 which is
stable. The critical mass ratio at which instability occurs has been estimated
by accurate methods [6]

Comparing the results (1) and (2) indicates a window for Borromean binding.
In particular, for M/m = 2, which corresponds for instance to a deuteron and a
proton, the molecule (M +, m+, M −, m−) is bound, but neither (M ±, m∓, M ±)
nor (m±, m∓, M ±) are stable. The molecule experiences a new type of binding
mechanism, which is more fragile. It would be interesting to investigate the
wave function in some detail, and study to what extent it diﬀers from that of
the positronium molecule.

One could also resume the numerical investigations of Ref. [6] and deter-
mine the position of stability border of (m+
4 ) in the vicinity of
the (m1 = m3, m2 = m4) line. Already, some minimal extension of the domain
of Borromean binding can be made without any new 4-body calculation, pro-
vided the stability border is accurately known in the 3-body case. Consider for
instance the conﬁguration given by the inverse masses

[(A ± ǫ)+, a+, (A ∓ ǫ)−, a−] , or [A+(a ± η)+, A−(a ∓ η)−] ,

where A = M −1 and a = m−1 links to the previous notation, for ǫ = η = 0. If
|ǫ| < |a−A|, the lowest threshold remains given by [(A±ǫ)+, (A∓ǫ)−]+[a+, a−],
which has the same energy as for ǫ = 0, since the inverse masses average out
when building the reduced mass for each atom. On the other hand, the four-

4

body Hamiltonian for the ﬁrst conﬁgurations can be written

H(ǫ) = H(0) ±

(p2

1 − p2

(4)

The second term breaks charge-conjugation symmetry and lowers the ground
state. This can be seen by applying the variational principle with the symmetric
ground-state wave-function of H(0) as a trial wave-function for H(ǫ). Hence, the
4-body molecule has an improved stability for ǫ 6= 0 in (4). As ǫ departs from 0,
the 3-body subsystems follow transverse and longitudinal paths starting from
the α1 = α3 or α1 = α2 symmetry axis of the triangle, as pictured schematically
in Fig. 1. It should be not too diﬃcult to determine up to which values of ǫ
the 3-body systems remain unstable. The same reasoning can be applied to the
second conﬁgurations.

For example, if the mass ratio of the protonium molecule (p, p, ¯p, ¯p) is modi-
ﬁed by replacing a proton and an antiproton by a deuteron and an antideuteron,
the resulting molecule (p, d, ¯p, ¯d) becomes Borromean, without any bound 3-
body subsystem. This can be compared with the observation by Bertini et al.
that if one screens the Coulomb potential in the hydrogen molecule, that is to
say, r−1
ij → exp(−µrij )/rij for all pairs, there is a range of values of µ for which
H2 remains bound while neither H+

2 nor H are stable [7].

This investigation grew out of discussions with Dario Bressanini and Andr´e
Martin. Comments by E.A.G. Armour, A.S. Jensen and K. Varga are also

We perform calculations of the dependence of nuclear magnetic moments on quark masses and
obtain limits on the variation of (mq/ΛQCD) from recent atomic clock experiments with hyper-
ﬁne transitions in H, Rb, Cs, Yb+, Hg+ and optical transition in Hg+. Experiments with Cd+,
deuterium/hydrogen, molecule SF6, Zeeman transitions in 3He/Xe are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Interest in the temporal and spatial variation of major
constants of physics has been recently revived by astro-
nomical data which seem to suggest a variation of the
electromagnetic constant α = e2/¯hc at the 10−5 level for
the time scale 10 billion years, see [1] (a discussion of
other limits can be found in the review [2] and references
therein). However, an independent experimental conﬁr-
mation is needed.

The hypothetical uniﬁcation of all interactions implies
that variation of the electromagnetic interaction constant
α should be accompanied by the variation of masses and
the strong interaction constant. Speciﬁc predictions need
a model. For example, the grand uniﬁcation model dis-
cussed in [3] predicts that the quantum chromodynamic
(QCD) scale ΛQCD (deﬁned as the position of the Landau
pole in the logarithm for the running strong coupling con-
stant) is modiﬁed as follows: δΛQCD/ΛQCD ≈ 34δα/α.
The variation of quark and electron masses in this model
is given by δm/m ∼ 70δα/α. This gives an estimate for
the variation of the dimensionless ratio

δ(m/ΛQCD)
(m/ΛQCD)

∼ 35

δα
α

(1)

This result is strongly model-dependent. However, the
large coeﬃcients in these expressions are generic for
grand uniﬁcation models, in which modiﬁcations come
from high energy scales: they appear because the running
strong coupling constant and Higgs constants (related to
mass) run faster than α. This means that if these models
are correct the variation of masses and strong interaction
may be easier to detect than the variation of α.

One can measure only variation of the dimensionless
quantities, therefore we want to extract from the mea-
surements variation of the dimensionless ratio mq/ΛQCD
where mq is the quark mass (with the dependence on the
normalization point removed). A number of limits on
variation of mq/ΛQCD have been obtained recently from
consideration of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, quasar ab-
sorption spectra and Oklo natural nuclear reactor which
was active about 1.8 billion years ago [4, 5, 6, 7] (see
also [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]). Below we consider the limits

which follow from laboratory atomic clock comparison.
Laboratory limits with a time base about a year are es-
pecially sensitive to oscillatory variation of fundamental
constants. A number of relevant measurements have been
performed already and even larger number have been
started or planned. The increase in precision is very fast.
It has been pointed out by Karshenboim [13] that mea-
surements of ratio of hyperﬁne structure intervals in dif-
ferent atoms are sensitive to variation of nuclear mag-
netic moments. First rough estimates of the dependence
of nuclear magnetic moments on mq/ΛQCD and limits
on time variation of this ratio have been obtained in our
paper [4]. Using H, Cs and Hg+ measurements [14, 15],
we obtained the limit on variation of mq/ΛQCD about
5 · 10−13 per year. Below we calculate the dependence
of nuclear magnetic moments on mq/ΛQCD and obtain
the limits from recent atomic clock experiments with hy-
perﬁne transitions in H, Rb, Cs,Yb+,Hg+ and optical
transition in Hg+. It is convenient to assume that the
strong interaction scale ΛQCD does not vary, so we will
speak about variation of masses. We shall restore ΛQCD
in ﬁnal answers.

The hyperﬁne structure constant can be presented in

the following form

A = const × [

mee4
¯h2 ][α2Frel(Zα)][µ

me
mp

]

(2)

The factor in the ﬁrst bracket is an atomic unit of en-
ergy. The second “electromagnetic” bracket determines
the dependence on α. An approximate expression for the
relativistic correction factor (Casimir factor) for s-wave
electron is the following

where γ = p1 − (Zα)2, Z is the nuclear charge. Varia-
tion of α leads to the following variation of Frel [14]:

Frel =

γ(4γ2 − 1)

Frel

= K

δα
α

K =

(Zα)2(12γ2 − 1)
γ2(4γ2 − 1)

(3)

(4)

(5)

More accurate numerical many-body calculations [16] of
the dependence of the hyperﬁne structure on α have

shown that the coeﬃcient K is slightly larger than that
given by this formula. For Cs (Z=55) K= 0.83 (in-
stead of 0.74), for Rb K=0.34 (instead of 0.29), for Hg+
K=2.28 (instead of 2.18).

The last bracket in eq. (2) contains the dimensionless
nuclear magnetic moment µ in nuclear magnetons ( the
nuclear magnetic moment M = µ e¯h
2mpc ), electron mass
me and proton mass mp. We may also include a small
correction due to the ﬁnite nuclear size. However, its
contribution is insigniﬁcant.

Recent experiments measured time dependence of the
ratios of hyperﬁne structure intervals of 199Hg+ and H
[14], 133Cs and 87Rb [17] and ratio of optical frequency
in Hg+ and 133Cs hyperﬁne frequency [18]. In the ratio
of two hyperﬁne structure constants for diﬀerent atoms
time dependence may appear from the ratio of the fac-
tors Frel (depending on α) and ratio of nuclear magnetic
moments (depending on mq/ΛQCD). Magnetic moments
in a single-particle approximation (one unpaired nucleon)
are:

µ = (gs + (2j − 1)gl)/2

for j = l + 1/2.

µ =

j
2(j + 1)

(−gs + (2j + 3)gl)

(6)

(7)

for j = l − 1/2. Here the orbital g-factors are gl = 1
for valence proton and gl = 0 for valence neutron. The
present values of spin g-factors gs are gp = 5.586 for
proton and gn = −3.826 for neutron. They depend on
mq/ΛQCD. The light quark masses are only about 1%
of the nucleon mass (mq = (mu + md)/2 ≈ 5 MeV).
The nucleon magnetic moment remains ﬁnite in the chiral
limit of mu = md = 0. Therefore, one may think that the
corrections to gs due to the ﬁnite quark masses are very
small. However, there is a mechanism which enhances
quark mass contribution: π-meson loop corrections to
the nucleon magnetic moments which are proportional
to π-meson mass mπ ∼ pmqΛQCD; mπ=140 MeV is not
so small.

According to calculation in Ref. [19] dependence of the
nucleon g-factors on π-meson mass mπ can be approxi-
mated by the following equation

g(mπ) =

g(0)
1 + amπ + bm2
π

(8)

where a= 1.37/GeV , b= 0.452/GeV2 for proton and a=
1.85/GeV , b= 0.271/GeV2 for neutron. This formula
is a ﬁt of the numerical calculations performed using the
Cloudy Bag Model (pion ﬁeld coupled to nucleon quarks).
This model reproduces leading terms of chiral perturba-
tion theory for nucleon magnetic moments [20] (small mπ
limit). The results also agree with lattice calculations
[19] (performed at mπ ∼ 500 MeV). Eq. (8) leads to the
following estimates:

δgn
gn

= −0.213

= −0.107

δmq

(10)

Eqs. (6,7,9,10) give variation of nuclear magnetic mo-
ments as functions of mq/ΛQCD.

The measured time variations of ratios of hyperﬁne fre-
quencies depend on two parameters: the ratio of proton
spin magnetic moment and proton orbital magnetic mo-
ment (this ratio is proportional to gp) and the ratio of
proton and neutron spin magnetic moments (Mp/Mn =
gp/gn). According to eqs. (9, 10) the ratio gp/gn practi-
cally does not depend on mq and seems to be not sensi-
tive to variation of quark masses and strong interaction.
However, this conclusion may be misleading. Magnetic
moments depend also on the strange quark mass ms. In
the minimal order of the chiral perturbation theory this
dependence is dominated by mixing p − K +Λ. Similar
process involving K 0 meson loop and Λ does not con-
tribute to the neutron magnetic moment since K 0 does
not carry electric charge. As a result lowest order cor-
rections for proton and neutron magnetic moments are
very diﬀerent: for proton a(K)/a(π) = 0.4, for neutron
a(K)/a(π) = −0.03 [20, 21] (see eq. (8) for deﬁnition
of the coeﬃcient a). The proton (or neutron) g-factor
is a ratio of the proton (or neutron) spin magnetic mo-
ment to the nuclear magneton e¯h/2mpc (quantum for
proton orbital magnetic moment). Therefore, depen-
dence of gp ∼ Mpmp and gn ∼ Mnmp on the strange
quark mass may also appear from the relatively large
(∼ 20%) contribution of ms to the proton mass mp [4, 6].
In the case of gp this contribution is of opposite sign to
that of the lowest order in the chiral perturbation theory
(a(K)mK) and has comparable magnitude. This cancel-
lation means that we can not reliably determine depen-
dence of gp on the strange quark mass ms. In this case
it would be safer to neglect contribution of the strange
quark mass to gp. However, we want to keep dependence
on the strange quark mass in the ratio of neutron and pro-
ton magnetic moments since in a number of cases this is
the only eﬀect which provides dependence on fundamen-
tal masses and strong interaction. Using the lowest or-
der chiral perturbation theory results [20, 21] presented
above we obtain the dependence on the strange quark
mass δ(gn/gp)
. This result should possibly be
gn/gp
treated as an order of magnitude estimate since K- me-
son mass is not as small as π-meson mass and accuracy
of the chiral theory may be low in this case. Thus, we
arrive to the following equations:

Note that transferring the entire ms-dependence into the
neutron g-factor is mostly a matter of convenience, all
that we can say is that gn/gp depends on ms/ΛQCD. Now

we can ﬁnd variation of nuclear magnetic moments using
eqs. (6,7). For all even Z nuclei with valence neutron
µ = δgn
(199Hg,171Yb,111Cd, etc) we obtain δµ

As an intermediate result it is convenient to present
dependence of the ratio of hyperﬁne constant A to atomic
unit of energy E = mee
(or energy of 1s-2s transition in
¯h2
hydrogen equal to 3/8 E) on variation of the fundamental
constants. We introduce a parameter V deﬁned by the

We start from the hyperﬁne structure of 133Cs which is
used as a frequency standard. Using eqs.(2,13) we obtain

Therefore, the result of the measurement [17] may be
presented as a limit on variation of the parameter X:

dX(CsRb)

(24)

Note that if the relation (1) is correct, variation
of X(CsRb) would be dominated by variation of
[mq/ΛQCD]. The relation (1) would give X(CsRb) ∝ α7.

For A(133Cs)/A(H) we have

X(CsH) =

Therefore, the result of the measurements [15] may be

For A(199Hg)/A(H) we have

X(HgH) =

The result of measurement [14] may be presented as

Here we have taken into account that the proton mass

other atoms we obtain

In Ref.

[13] the limit on variation of the ratio of hy-
perﬁne transition frequencies 171Yb+/133Cs has been ob-
tained (this limit is based on measurements [22]). Us-
ing eqs. (16,21) we can present the result as a limit on
X(Y bCs) = α0.7[ms/ΛQCD]0.11:

The optical clock transition energy E(Hg) (λ=282 nm)

in Hg+ ion can be presented in the following form:

E(Hg) = const × [

Numerical calculation of the relative variation of E(Hg)
has given [16]:

This corresponds to V (HgOpt) = α−3.2. Variation of the
ratio of the Cs hyperﬁne splitting A(Cs) to this optical

Now we can use these results to ﬁnd limits on variation
of the fundamental constants from the measurements of
the time dependence of hyperﬁne structure intervals. The
dependence of ratio of frequencies A(133Cs)/A(87Rb) can
be presented in the following form

X(Opt) =

V (HgOpt)

eter:

Molecular rotational transitions frequencies are pro-
portional to me/mp, therefore one should assume V =
me/ΛQCD. For vibrational molecular transtions V =
(me/ΛQCD)1/2.
Comparison of Cs hyperﬁne stan-
dard with SF6 molecular vibration frequencies was dis-
cussed in Ref.
In this case X(CsV ibrations) =
α2.8[me/ΛQCD]0.5[mq/ΛQCD]0.1.

[23].

The measurements of hyperﬁne constant ratio in dif-
ferent isotopes of the same atom depends on the ratio
of magnetic moments and is sensitive to mq/ΛQCD. For
example, it would be interesting to measure the rate of
change for hydrogen/deuterium ratio where X(HD) =
[mq/ΛQCD]−0.05[ms/ΛQCD]0.23.

R. Walsworth suggested to measure the ratio of the
Zeeman transition frequencies in noble gases which gives
us time dependence of ratio of nuclear magnetic mo-
ments. Consider, for example 129Xe/3He. For 3He the
magnetic moment is very close to that of neutron. For
other noble gases nuclear magnetic moment is also given
by valence neutron, however, there are signiﬁcant many-
body corrections. For 129Xe the valence neutron is in
s1/2 state which corresponds to the single-particle value
of nuclear magnetic moment µ = µn = −1.913. The
measured value is µ = −0.778. The magnetic moment of
the nucleus changes most eﬃciently due to the spin-spin

interaction because valence neutron transfers a part of its
spin < sz > to core protons and proton magnetic moment
is large and has opposite sign. In this approximation µ =
(1 − b)µn + bµp. This gives b=0.24 and the ratio of mag-
netic moments Y ≡ µ(129Xe)/µ(3He)≈ 0.76 + 0.24gp/gn.
Using eqs.(11,12) we obtain an estimate for the varia-
tion of this ratio δY /Y ≈ 0.1δms/ms. Therefore, in this
case one can measure variation of µ(129Xe)/µ(3He) cor-
responding to variation of X = [ms/ΛQCD]0.1.

Note that an accuracy of the results presented in this
paper depends strongly on fundamental constant we are
studying. The accuracy for the dependence on α is few
percent. The accuracy for mq/ΛQCD is about 30%, it
is limited by the accuracy of a single-particle approxi-
mation for nuclear magnetic moments. The results for
ms/ΛQCD should possibly be treated as order of mag-
nitude estimates. However, the accuracy here may be
improved using proper QCD calculation [24]. Relation
(1) between variation of α and m/ΛQCD has been used
as an illustration only.

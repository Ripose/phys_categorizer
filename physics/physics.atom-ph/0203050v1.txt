Abstract. Laser induced line narrowing eﬀect, dis-
covered more than thirty years ago, can also be applied
to recent studies in high resolution spectroscopy based
on electromagnetically induced transparency. In this pa-
per we ﬁrst present a general form of the transmission
width of electromagnetically induced transparency in a
homogeneously broadened medium. We then analyze a
Doppler broadened medium by using a Lorentzian func-
tion as the atomic velocity distribution. The dependence
of the transmission linewidth on the driving ﬁeld inten-
sity is discussed and compared to the laser induced line
narrowing eﬀect. This dependence can be characterized
by a parameter which can be regarded as “the degree of
optical pumping”.

Over the last decade, considerable attention has been
paid to the studies of the atomic coherence eﬀects and
their applications [1,2]. The technique of Electromag-
netically Induced Transparency (EIT) which makes an
opaque medium become transparent by applying an ex-
ternal coherent radiation ﬁeld [3,4], yields various appli-
cations from enhancement of nonlinear optical processes
In addition to the elimina-
[5–7], to slow light [8–14].
tion of absorption, the absorption proﬁle reveals a narrow
transmission line, which has been applied to high reso-
lution spectroscopy and high sensitivity magnetometer
[15–18].

Since many of these experiments are performed in an
atomic cell conﬁguration, the Doppler broadening eﬀect
on EIT is an important concern. Recent theoretical inves-
tigations of Doppler broadening eﬀects on EIT, however,
has been focused mainly on the existence of EIT for cer-
tain conﬁgurations [19–21]. The issue of EIT linewidth
for a Doppler broadened medium has been lately ad-
dressed by Taichenachev and coworkers [22]. As the
width of transmission line is directly related to the dis-
persion near the EIT resonance, it is also a key issue in
dispersive measurements.

In a three-level Λ-type system if the system is homoge-
neously broadened, as is well known, EIT can be achieved
when the intensity of the driving ﬁeld (Ω2) is larger than
the product of the decay rate of the coherence between
the lower levels (γbc) and the homogeneous linewidth (γ).
Then, if the system is inhomogeneously broadened (say,
with the width WD), one might guess that EIT can be
achieved when Ω2 is larger than γbcWD instead of γbcγ.
This is not so. We show that one can still have EIT when
Ω2
γbcγ even in the case of inhomogeneous broaden-
ing.

WD.

For the spectral width of EIT, if the system is homo-
geneously broadened, the two absorption lines are sepa-
rated approximately by the Rabi frequency of the driving
ﬁeld Ω when Ω is larger than the homogeneous linewidth
γ, it becomes Ω2/γ. Then, if the sys-
γ. When Ω
tem is inhomogeneously broadened, it might be inferred
that the EIT width goes as Ω when Ω is larger than the
inhomogeneous linewidth WD, and becomes Ω2/WD as
Ω

≪
In the literature, however, we ﬁnd that the narrow fea-
ture superimposed on the Doppler broadened proﬁle has
been studied more than thirty years ago. Laser induced
line narrowing eﬀect was discovered by Feld and Javan
[23] and the spectral width of the narrow line was shown
to be linearly proportional to the driving ﬁeld Rabi fre-
quency. Various aspects of this eﬀect has been investi-
gated by H¨ansch and Toschek [24], and it was also called
nonlinear interference eﬀects [25]. In a recent article [26],
it has been proposed that this laser induced line narrow-
ing can be applied to the recent experiments based on
EIT and the spectral line of the EIT resonance can be
narrower in a Doppler broadened system than in a ho-
mogeneously broadened system. Here we analyze these
ideas in detail and demonstrate the power broadening of
the linewidth of EIT resonance in a Doppler broadened
system.

Under the condition of Ω

WD, there are again two
diﬀerent regimes of EIT width: In one limit it is propor-
tional to the Rabi frequency of the driving ﬁeld, which
has the same expression as the spectral width shown in
the study of laser induced line narrowing [23]. As the

driving ﬁeld gets strong, it becomes power broadened
and indeed has a form proportional to the intensity of
driving ﬁeld (as Ω2/WD).

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. I we set
up our model scheme of the three-level system and the
transmission width of EIT in a homogeneously broadened
medium is discussed. In Sec. II the Doppler averaged sus-
ceptibility is obtained by using a Lorentzian function for
the velocity distribution and the absorption proﬁle, the
EIT condition, and the linewidth of EIT are discussed.
Comparison between the closed system and the open sys-
tem is brieﬂy given in Sec. III. Section IV contains the
summary of the present paper.

A. Optical pumping and population distribution

Let us ﬁnd the population of each level in the absence
of the probe ﬁeld (i.e. the zeroth order population). Ob-
viously, if the driving ﬁeld is not turned on, we have
ρaa = 0 and ρbb = ρcc = 1/2 from Eq. (2). Now as the
driving ﬁeld being turned on, in steady state, we have

rate from the level a to b, i,e. γ′ = γ and the driv-
ing ﬁeld detuning is denoted as ∆0. Then, we have

A. Doppler average using a Lorentzian distribution

We now need to evaluate the expression of susceptibil-
ity given in Eq. (24).Normally, the velocity distribution
is described by a Gaussian function given by

where u =
2kBT /M is the most probable speed of
the atom given by temperature T and the atomic mass
M . Then, the full width at half maximum is given as
2WD = 2√ln 2ku. However, in our analysis, for the sake
of simple analytic expressions, we adopt a Lorentzian dis-
tribution of FWHM of 2WD, instead of a Gaussian dis-
tribution, such that

The two distributions are shown in Fig. 2, and there
we see that a Gaussian distribution with the same width
(FWHM 2WD) has its maximum larger than that of
Lorentzian distribution by a factor of √π ln 2. Hence,
if we multiply the factor √π ln 2 in Eq. (28), the central
distribution becomes very similar to that of Gaussian as
illustrated in Fig. 2(c).

The expression of Eq. (51) shows a reminiscence of
power broadening factor in the description of hole burn-
ing [28]. In place of the homogeneous linewidth in the ex-
pression of hole burning, here we have an eﬀective width
which is determined by the spectral packet involved in
population trapping [26].

We have seen that the parameter x = Ω/Ωs plays an
important role in the case of inhomogeneously broadened
medium. Let us here examine the physical meaning of the
parameter.

Suppose the system is homogeneously broadened.
When the driving is on resonance, the optical pumping
rate from the level c is then order of Ω2/γ, as given in
Eq. (10). A complete optical pumping within the homo-
geneous linewidth, is then possible if this rate is larger
than the pumping from level b to c: Ω2/γ
γbc. This, in
turn, gives the EIT condition. When we have the driving
ﬁeld detuned by ∆0, the optical pumping rate decreases
by a factor of γ2/(γ2 + ∆2
0). Again for a complete optical
pumping we need Ω2γ/[γ2 + ∆2
0]

γbc.

≫

If we now assume that we have the resonant driving
ﬁeld ∆0 = 0 again, and, instead, the atoms are moving.
Then, for atoms with velocity v, the optical pumping
rate becomes Ω2γ/[γ2 + (kv)2]. Then, on the average,
to have a complete optical pumping in a Doppler broad-
ened system we need to require Ω2γ/(γ2 + W 2

III. COMPARISON WITH AN OPEN SYSTEM
DESCRIPTION

In this section we examine the case of an open system
and show that the result is essentially the same as our
model of a closed system. The open system is modeled
for the atoms that are coming in and out of the interac-
tion (with the radiation ﬁelds) region. Although in such
a case all the levels have the same decay rate (say, γbc),
the upper level can decay much faster than the time of
ﬂight through the interaction region (for example, radia-
tive decay or collisional decay). Hence we assume that
the lower levels b and c decay with rate γbc and the upper
level a decays with rate γa which is much bigger than γbc
(see Fig. 5).

rate γbc. Atoms are pumped at a rate r equally to the lower
levels.

Furthermore, for simplicity, we assume that the atoms
are coming into the interaction region with a same rate
for the lower levels. Under these assumption, the equa-
tion of motion for the density matrix elements can be
written as

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have studied the transmission width
of EIT in a three-level Λ system. The Doppler averaged
susceptibility is found by using a Lorentzian velocity dis-
tribution rather than the Gaussian distribution. Then
we have shown the requirement for achieving EIT, and
the analytic expression of the EIT linewidth. The satu-
ration intensity Ω2
s deﬁnes the degree of optical pumping
s, and represents the condition under which the
as Ω2/Ω2
broadening is either linear or quadratic in the Rabi fre-
quency of the driving ﬁeld.

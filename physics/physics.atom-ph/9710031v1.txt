Abstract

A new approach to multi-dimensional quantum scattering by the inﬁnite

order discrete variable representation is presented. Determining the expansion

coeﬃcients of the wave function at the asymptotic regions by the solution

of the diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation, we reduce an inﬁnite set of linear

equations to a ﬁnite one. Application to the benchmark collinear H + H2

→

H2 + H reaction is shown to yield precise reaction probabilities.

One of the most common approach to the solution of quantum scattering problem is

the application of square-integrable (L2) basis functions [1–5]. Of the L2 basis methods the

discrete variable representation(DVR) method [6] is proven to be highly successful [7–9].

The DVR is a grid-point representation in which the potential energy is diagonal and the

kinetic energy is a sum of one-dimensional matrices. Hence the Hamiltonian matrix is

extremely sparse, which means that iterative linear algebra methods [10] can deal eﬃciently

with extremely large systems.

Recently, Eisenberg et. al. [11] has developed an inﬁnite order DVR method for one-

dimensional quantum reactive scattering problems. They expanded the wave function in

terms of an inﬁnite set of L2 basis functions satisfying the conditions of DVR [6–8,12]. The

matrix related to the resulting set of algebraic equations, though inﬁnite, has been shown to

have the structure of a Toeplitz matrix [13]. Using the analytical properties of the Toeplitz

matrix, they reduced the inﬁnite set of algebraic equations to a ﬁnite one and obtained very

accurate results for one-dimensional potential scattering. However, their method is not likely

to be extended to multi-dimensional systems due to the failure of the Toeplitz properties.

In this Letter, we show that the inﬁnite order DVR can be properly converted into a

ﬁnite DVR even for multi-dimensional reactive systems. Instead of investigating the ana-

lytical properties of the Toeplitz matrix, we use the solutions of the diﬀerential Schr¨odinger

equations at the asymptotic regions.

The full scattering wave function Ψn is decomposed of the incoming distorted wave θ−

where n is a channel index, i.e., a superindex over the arrangement and rovibrational in-

dices. The distorted wave θ−

n is any regular scattering solution corresponding to a simple

nonreactive (i.e., arrangement conserving) Hamiltonian, H0n, in the asymptotic region in

the arrangement channel n:

Using the inﬁnite order uniform DVR [8], (5) is transformed into an inﬁnite set of cou-

pled linear algebraic equations. To do this, we introduce the following convenient sets of

where ri and Ri are respectively the values of r and R at the DVR grid point i, and w is the

quadrature weight [6–8,12], the above overlaps can be easily obtained by numerical integra-

tion of the diﬀerential Sch¨odinger equation (2) corresponding to the nonreactive scattering

region discussed earlier.

Thus far we have shown that the derived scattering matrix (25) is completely general

enough to deal with the fully three dimensional scattering processes. For the sake of compar-

ison with other accurate calculations, we apply the method to the collinear H + H2

H2 +

→

H reaction in the energy range of 0.4

1.0 eV. The coordinate axes for the DVR are chosen

−

to be the normal ones of the transition state [16] as shown in Fig. 1. We use the LSTH

potential energy surface [14]. The distorted wave functions, θ+

n , are calculated by integrating

the coupled diﬀerential equations (2) inward from Rasymp(

20.0 a.u.) to Rmax(

6.0 a.u.)

Fig. 2 illustrates the convergence of P0(E) and P1(E) at E = 0.9678 eV, where Pnr (E)

is the total reaction probability from a given reactant molecular state nr to any product

molecular states at energy E, i.e.,

Pnr (E) =

as the size of the region of reactive interaction, Rmax, is increased, for diﬀerent values of

the grid constant nB [8,16]. The percent error is calculated by comparison to the results of

6

Colbert and Miller [8]. The convergence for E = 0.9678 with respect to nB for Rmax = 8.0

is also shown in Fig. 3. The total reaction probabilities, with Rmax = 8.0 and nB = 3.4,

are converged to within 0.05% at this energy,. Fig. 4 shows excellent agreement of the

converged results for P0(E) and P1(E) with the exact results of Bondi and Connor [15] over

a range of total energies including the resonance energy near 0.9 eV.

In summary, the inﬁnite order DVR theory for multi-dimensional reactive scattering has

been presented. By applying it to the collinear H + H2

H2 + H reaction, we obtained

→

precise reaction probabilities comparable with the other results obtained from the direct

integration of the diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation (3) [15]. The advantages of the present

theory are as follows: 1.

iterative linear algebra methods are readily applicable, 2. no

numerical integrals are needed for calculating the matrix elements, 3. as can be seen from

(19),(20),(24) and (25), no regularization techniques [3,8] for the distorted wave functions

are necessary since no informations on those functions in the reactive (strong) interaction

region are required although they are set to be regular at R = 0 in the beginning (1), 4. the

eﬀective Green’s operator G+ in the reactive interaction region is obtained as a by-product,

5. the formalism is completely general and can be applied to any non-collinear scattering

problems including collinear systems.

High-harmonic generation from arbitrarily oriented diatomic molecules
including nuclear motion and ﬁeld-free alignment

We present a theoretical model of high-harmonic generation from diatomic molecules. The theory
includes eﬀects of alignment as well as nuclear motion and is used to predict results for N2, O2,
H2 and D2. The results show that the alignment dependence of high-harmonics is governed by the
symmetry of the highest occupied molecular orbital and that the inclusion of the nuclear motion in
the theoretical description generally reduces the intensity of the harmonic radiation. We compare
our model with experimental results on N2 and O2, and obtain very good agreement.

INTRODUCTION

is

High-harmonic

generation (HHG)

a process
in strong-ﬁeld physics that occurs when the non-
perturbative driving of an electron by an external ﬁeld
makes it leave its parent atom or molecule, propagate in
the ﬁeld and ﬁnally when the electron is steered back to
its origin, recombine under the emission of a high-energy
photon [1]. The process is coherent, so the result of the
interaction is the production of high-frequency coherent
radiation. The emitted signal can be used to create co-
herent UV or XUV pulses, and this radiation may then,
e.g., in fundamental science be utilized to probe ultrafast
attosecond electron dynamics (see Refs. [2, 3] for recent
reviews).

As compared to atoms, diatomic molecules possess ad-
ditional degrees of freedom, namely the nuclear separa-
tion and the orientation with respect to the laser ﬁeld.
Studies of HHG from the H+
2 molecular ion [4, 5, 6] along
with the molecules N2 and O2 [7, 8] show that the ex-
tra parameters of the molecules give rise to additional
eﬀects on the harmonic spectrum. There are two rea-
sons why this complex behavior for molecules is of inter-
est: (i) the extra parameters available for manipulating
HHG from the molecules may be useful tools for con-
trolling the intensity of the harmonics. (ii) the fact that
the harmonic spectrum contains features reminiscent of
the molecular structure means that the emitted signals
provide a way to study the nuclear motion and attosec-
ond electron dynamics of the source of the high-harmonic
radiation [9, 10, 11, 12].

The complete theoretical modeling of HHG is compu-
tationally very challenging. In ab initio approaches the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation has to be propa-
gated in a box much larger than is the case for strong-
ﬁeld ionization studies since in the former case one has to
make sure that the electronic wave packet does not en-
gage with an absorbing boundary. Additional complica-
tions come from the subsequent propagation of Maxwell’s
equations in the generating medium, and in any case
going beyond an eﬀective one-electron model, or other
reduced dimensionality models, seems impossible in the
foreseeable future. These complications underline the im-

portance of developing accurate approximate theories. In
particular for molecules, such models, which should be
relatively inexpensive to evaluate, are of interest since
investigations aiming, e.g., at an increased degree of con-
trol of the harmonic production, require a set of eval-
uations for diﬀerent bond-lengths and orientations with
respect to the ﬁeld. In this paper we present one such
theory. We provide a model to calculate the angular de-
pendence of the harmonic signal from a single diatomic
molecule of arbitrary orientation with respect to the laser
ﬁeld. In particular we include the eﬀect of nuclear mo-
tion (vibration), and we test the accuracy of the model
by comparison with experiments. High-harmonic gen-
eration from diatomic molecules has already been con-
sidered in an extension of the Lewenstein model [13] in
Ref. [7].
In that work depletion from the initial state
was considered but the nuclear motion was ignored. Re-
cently, the strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA) for HHG in
diatomic molecules subject to ultrashort laser pulses was
presented, again ignoring nuclear motion, but combined
with a careful saddle-point analysis and a discussion of
the gauge problem [14]. Here, we are concerned with the
response to a monochromatic ﬁeld, and in parallel with
the conventions in the theory of strong-ﬁeld ionization,
we will refer to our theory as the length gauge version of
the molecular SFA for HHG.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we
present the theory for HHG from diatomic molecules in
monochromatic linearly polarized laser ﬁelds. Section III
contains some calculational details. In Sec. IV we show
the HHG yields for N2 and O2 as a function of the orien-
tation of the molecules with respect to the laser polariza-
tion, and compare with experimental measurements. By
discussing HHG signals from the isotopes H2 and D2, we
also see how a diﬀerence in nuclear mass aﬀects the har-
monic spectrum. The paper ends with a summary and a
conclusion in Sec. V. Appendix A contains a discussion
of the momentum space wave function of a molecule in
the single-active-electron (SAE) approximation.

II. THEORY

In our treatment of the HHG from molecules, we ex-
tend the atomic model of Ref. [15], and include notions
of nuclear motion. We consider the case, where the
laser pulse contains several cycles such that a Floquet
approach is suitable. As we shall see below when we
compare with experimental results, even for probe pulses
of 50 fs [11] and 35 fs [12] duration this turns out to be
an accurate approximation. Hence, using the Coulomb
gauge and the dipole approximation, a laser ﬁeld with fre-
quency ω and period T = 2π/ω is described by the vector
potential A(t) = A0 cos(ωt). The electric ﬁeld, F(t), is
∂A(t)/∂t, i.e., F(t) = F0 sin(ωt) with F0 = ωA0
then
[atomic units, e = ~ = me = a0 = 1, are used throughout
unless indicated otherwise].

From Eq. (1) it is clear, that in order to obtain the
dipole moment, we need a solution of Eq. (3). The state
is determined by using the description of the laser-

i
molecule system given in Ref. [16]. Here nuclear mo-
tion is modelled within the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) ap-
proximation, and, assuming negligible electron-electron
correlation, the electrons are put into orbitals obtained
from Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. Consequently, the
interaction of the molecule can be treated in the SAE
approximation, where the active electron is the electron
in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). We
write
as a superposition of the ﬁeld-free state of
the molecule and ﬁnal states, where the active electron is
excited to the continuum. The expansion coeﬃcients are
obtained under the assumption that there is only limited
ionization, which again requires that the laser intensity
is below saturation (the regime of relevance in the HHG
process). Inserting the expanded state into Eq. (1), we
arrive at the following approximation to the dipole mo-

A. The harmonics and the three-step picture

The harmonic spectrum is calculated from the Fourier
transform of the dipole moment d0(t), which implies that
the intensity of the N th harmonic is proportional to the
norm square of the N th Fourier component, dN . This
Fourier component is investigated by extending the tech-
nique of Ref. [15] to the molecular case

The direction of the momentum is parallel or anti-parallel
(prescribed by the positive or negative sign of σ de-
ﬁned below) to the polarization vector of the laser ﬁeld.
This momentum emerges after performing the q inte-
gration in Eq. (9), provided that the laser ﬁeld is suf-
ﬁciently strong in the sense that the quiver radius, α0,
is large compared to the extent of the molecule. Fol-
lowing [15], we include only terms corresponding to real
values of K νi
k , because of the clear physical interpreta-
tion of Eq. (11). The exponential of the last line of
Eq. (11) describes the energy balance in this initial step,
is the FC factor associated with the transition

uum wave as the latter expands into three-dimensional
space. Finally, the matrix element

with associated phase factors and FC factor describes the
laser-assisted recombination (LAR) step of the three-step
model. We note that, in our model, the expression of
Eq. (11) predicts a correlation of the momentum of the
continuum electron with the nuclear motion of the resid-
ual molecular ion, through the oscillating time-dependent
exponential factors.

B. The harmonic spectrum from arbitrarily
oriented molecules

In order to be able to evaluate Eq. (11) for molecules
of arbitrary orientation with respect to the laser ﬁeld we
use a HOMO wave function, where the angular part is
expanded onto spherical harmonics.
In the body-ﬁxed
frame, where the z axis is chosen along the internuclear
axis, the HOMO wave function is then given by

φbf
0 (r) =

Fl,m(r)Y m

Xl
Here κ = √
2Eb, Eb is the binding energy of the active
electron in the HF ground state wave function and Z is
the net charge of the molecule, when the HOMO electron
is removed. The t′ integral of Eq. (11) corresponds to the
ATI step. It is well known that in this process the HOMO
electron escapes to the laser-dressed continuum, when the
distance to the nucleus is large [18]. As a result we can
employ the asymptotic form of the HOMO in the t′ inte-
grand in Eq. (11), and the integral will subsequently be
evaluated using the saddle-point method. This evalua-
tion proceeds as in Ref. [19], and the HOMO as given by
Eq. (14) is replaced in favor of the momentum space wave
function. It is suﬃcient to know the latter near its sin-
gular points, where it is given by the particularly simple
expression Eq. (A4), as described in Appendix A. The t
integration occurring in Eq. (11) corresponds to the LAR
step and is performed numerically. Previous publications
show that in the LAR step it is inadequate to approxi-

mate the HOMO with the asymptotic form, because the
recombination takes place at small separations of the ex-
cited electron and the molecular core [6, 20]. Also here
we prefer to replace the space wave function by from
Eq. (13) by the momentum space wave function, which
in the body ﬁxed frame may be written in the following
way

˜φbf
0 (q) =

Gl,m(q)Y m

l (ˆq),

(15)

where the Gl,m’s are obtained numerically. Because the
HOMO wave functions are expressed in terms of spher-
ical harmonics, we can easily obtain the wave functions
of the molecule in the laboratory frame, where the in-
ternuclear axis does not necessarily coincide with the z
axis. For a molecule, where the internuclear axis is ro-
tated with respect to the z axis of the laboratory frame,
the rotation is characterized by the three Euler angles
R = (α, β, γ) [21], and we arrive at the following expres-
sion of the N th harmonic for a molecule of orientation R

Equation (18) is evaluated along the real t axis, and when

q reduces to a partial derivative with respect
to the size q of the momentum. As mentioned earlier
we consider only values of k, where K νi
is real, which

serves to deﬁne a lower limit kmin of the sum. The up-
per limit kmax is determined by requiring convergence
of the calculated value of dN . Equation (16) along with
the accompanying deﬁnitions of Eqs. (17)-(19) summa-
rize the formulation of our model. A cruder estimate
of the harmonic generation can be obtained by using the

ATI and the LAR step. In this approximation the N th

where all functions are analytically known and where the
Clm parameters are available in Table I (see also Table

has the advantage that all geometric factors are pulled
outside the integration.

In Sec.

IV we compare HHG spectra obtained with
the two forms of Eqs. (16) and (20). In that section we
also show curves, which do not include nuclear motion.
When the nuclei are clamped, the harmonic strengths are
simply given by including only the ﬁrst term in the sum
over νi in Eqs. (16) and (20) and replacing the Franck-
Condon factors by unity.

III. CALCULATIONAL DETAILS

In this section we outline some calculational details to
be used below. First we sketch the procedure used to ob-
tain the Gl,m(q)’s and Cl,m’s of Eqs. (16) and (20). The
initial step in the procedure is to solve the HF equations
fully numerically for the diatomic molecules [22]. In this
manner the ground state orbitals are obtained, and are
projected onto spherical harmonics to attain the radial
functions Fl,m(r). The asymptotic angular coeﬃcients
are found by comparing the HF radial wave functions
with the form Cl,mrZ/κ−1 exp(
κr), where the Cl,m’s are
used as ﬁtting parameters. The Gl,m(q)’s, on the other
hand, are obtained from the Fourier-Bessel transform of
the Fl,m(r)’s.

−

In the cases of N2 and O2 we compare results of our
model with experiments where the degree of molecular
alignment was controlled by non-adiabatically creating a
rotational wavepacket by a pump pulse and then moni-
toring the harmonic yield as a function of the time delay
to the intense probe pulse [11, 12]. In order to perform
a comparison with the experimental results, we need the
time-dependent angular distribution ρ(t, β) of the rota-
tional wave packet created by the pump pulse. We refer
to Ref. [23] for details about calculations of rotational
wave packets. We assume that rotation is negligible un-
der the probe pulse, and simply note at this point that
once the angular distribution is available, the amplitude

Z

of the N th harmonic at time t is given by

¯dN (t) =

dβ sin(β)ρ(t, β)dN (β).

(22)

where dN (β) can be found using Eq. (16) for a probe
laser parallel to the pump laser. We can then calculate
the intensity of each harmonic from the rotational wave
packet at every point of time.

Table I shows relevant information for the calculations

presented in the next section.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. The N2 molecule

×

We begin by presenting a calculation of HHG from the
N2 molecule with a HOMO of σg symmetry. The laser is
assumed to have an energy of ω = 0.057 a.u. correspond-
ing to a wavelength of λ = 800 nm, and the intensity is
1014 W/cm2 which is well below the
taken to be I = 2
saturation laser intensity [12]. Such a choice of parame-
ters is within the range of a Ti:Sapphire laser. Figure 1
shows the relative strength of the harmonics as a func-
tion of the harmonic order in a geometry, where the in-
ternuclear axis of the molecule is aligned parallel to the
polarization of the laser (β = 0◦). Note that we refer to
2) as
the norm square of the Fourier components (i.e.
the strength of the harmonics. There are three diﬀerent
curves on the ﬁgure, and the dotted curve corresponds to
Eq. (20), i.e., the case where the asymptotic wave func-
tion is used in both the ATI and LAR step of the HHG

Eq. (16) meaning that the improved wave function was
employed in the LAR step. Calculations represented by
the solid curve take nuclear motion into account. The
harmonic spectrum of the N2 molecule is diﬀerent, when
the asymptotic wave function is used everywhere as com-
pared to the case, when the improved wave function is
employed in the LAR step. This result shows that the
quality of the HOMO wave function is of importance. It
is also clear from Fig. 1 that the eﬀect of nuclear mo-
tion in the case of N2 is negligible. This is because the

molecule when using the asymptotic wave function in both the
LAR and ATI step, and when the wave function used in the
LAR step is improved. Only the solid curve includes nuclear
motion. The signals have been normalized to the strength
of the ﬁfth harmonic obtained by using the improved wave
function in the LAR step and including nuclear motion. The
internuclear axis and the polarization are parallel (β = 0◦).

BO potential energy curves of the N2 molecule and the
N+
2 molecular ion are nearly parallel, which means that
ionization of an N2 molecule in the ground state always
leaves the residual molecular N+
2 ion in the vibrational
ground state.

In Fig. 2 we study the orientation dependence of the
HHG yield from N2. It is seen from the ﬁgure that har-
monic generation for the parallel alignment (β = 0◦) is
more intense than the harmonic generation for the per-
pendicular alignment (β = 90◦), which reﬂects the orien-
tation dependence of the ionization of the molecule (see
Ref. [30] and references therein). The detailed angular
behavior depends on the harmonic order in considera-

tion: a minimum is observed at approximately 40◦ for
some orders. A similar behavior was recently predicted
in Ref. [7], where the minima were located at a relative
orientation close to 60◦.

Several experiments have measured the harmonic emis-
sion from non-adiabatically aligned N2 molecules [11, 12,
31]. We can simulate these results as outlined in Sec. III.
To compare with the results of Ref. [12] we use the time-
dependent angular distribution ρ(t, β) corresponding to a
rotational wave packet created by the experimental pump
1013 W/cm2, and the
pulse, 60 fs, 800 nm, intensity 4

K. To model the results from Ref. [11] we obtain the
time-dependent angular distribution with the experimen-
tal pump pulse of duration 50 fs and with wavelength 800
1013 W/cm2. In Eq. (22) the value
nm and intensity 6
of dN (β) is calculated using Eq. (16) for a laser of wave-

for further details.

as in the preceding subsection. Figure 4 shows the rel-
ative strength of the harmonics for β = 36◦. As in the
case of N2 it is important to use a better wave function
than the asymptotic one in the LAR step. The eﬀect
of nuclear motion is more pronounced than for the N2
molecule, because the Franck-Condon distribution of O2
is broader than that of the N2 molecule (see Ref. [32] for
more discussion on the implications on ﬁnal state vibra-
tional levels and possible control of these).

We now turn to the angular dependence of the har-
monics. The strength of some selected harmonics as a
function of the orientation with respect to the laser ﬁeld
is shown on Fig. 5. It is possible to understand the re-
sults of Fig. 5 from the symmetry of the HOMO. The πg
symmetry means that the HOMO has nodes along the
internuclear axis as well as perpendicular to it, and this
leads to a vanishing harmonic generation when β = 0◦
and β = 90◦. Consequently the harmonics take on max-
imal values for intermediate angels. All harmonics are
most intense at orientations near 45◦. It is also worth
noticing that the precise location of the individual peak
depends slightly on the order of the harmonic. This re-
ﬂects that higher harmonics probe regions closer to the
core.

For the O2 molecule, as well, several measurements of
HHG from a non-adiabatically aligned sample have been
carried out [11, 12, 31]. We compare our model calcula-
tions with the results presented in Ref. [11] in the case

harmonic from the rotational wave packet at every point
of time. On Fig. 3 we compare model calculations with
experimental results. The ﬁgure shows the evolution of
the harmonic emission from the N2 molecule as a function
of the delay time between the pump and probe pulse. In
general the agreement between experiments and theory
is very satisfactory.

tensity of a randomly aligned sample in our theoretical
results. The comparison is shown on Fig. 6, and we ob-
serve a ﬁne agreement between theory and experiment.

C. The isotopic molecules H2 and D2

We now turn to a short discussion of calculations car-
ried out for HHG from the isotopic molecules H2 and D2.
Harmonic spectra from these molecules provide a way to
study the eﬀect of nuclear motion, because the FC dis-
tributions of both H2 and D2 are broad. Furthermore a
comparison of the HHG signals from the isotopes con-
tains information on how the nuclear masses aﬀect the
harmonic spectrum.

In Fig. 7, showing HHG from the H2 molecule, we have
used the same laser parameters as in the case of N2 and
1014W/cm2. As seen
O2 studied above, i.e., 800 nm, 2
from the ﬁgure, it is essential to include nuclear motion
in the case of H2, and the general eﬀect of the nuclear
motion is to reduce the intensity of harmonic generation.
This can easily be understood from the fact that the FC

×

distributions of the isotope is broad. The broadness im-
plies that a substantial part of the harmonic signal orig-
inates from transitions, where the ionization potential is
higher than in the ﬁxed nuclei picture. As a result the
whole process gets more unlikely and so the radiative
emission is less intense. Very similar observations and
conclusions hold true in the case of D2.

To see how the nuclear mass inﬂuences HHG, we com-
pare the harmonic generation of the two isotopes for dif-
in

order to be able to compare with results of Ref.
[8]
we have furthermore included a calculation at inten-
1014 W/cm2 at energy ω = 0.0584 a.u.,
sity I = 4
although our assumption of negligible depletion of the
ground states is questionable in this situation. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 8. In Ref. [8] a two-dimensional
model was used and it was found that the heavier iso-
tope leads to stronger harmonic generation. We can-
not conclude something as simple from Fig. 8. Our non-
conclusive picture of the relation between nuclear mass
and HHG is supported by others [33], and is related to the
strong correlation of the vibrational states of the residual
molecular ion to the momentum of the excited electron
as follows from Eq. (11).

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have developed the strong-ﬁeld approximation for
HHG in diatomic molecules for calculating the harmonic
signal from a single diatomic molecule of arbitrary orien-
tation with respect to a monochromatic linearly polarized
laser ﬁeld. The model incorporates the eﬀect of nuclear
motion.

We calculated the high-harmonic emission from the
molecules N2, O2, H2 and D2. The two latter species
were considered in order to study the eﬀect of nuclear
motion in detail. The eﬀect of nuclear motion on these
light molecules was signiﬁcant and generally reduced the
intensity of the harmonics. However, there seems to be
no simple common relation between nuclear mass and the
intensity of the harmonic generation.

Turning to the N2, O2 cases, we successfully em-
ployed the present model to reproduce experimental re-
sults on HHG from non-adiabatically aligned N2 and O2
molecules [11, 12]. The spectra for N2 were very sensitive
to the quality of the wave functions used to describe the
molecule, while the eﬀect of nuclear motion was small.
The intensity of the harmonics was generally weaker,
when the angle between the laser polarization and the
internuclear axis was 90◦ as compared to the intensity at
an angle of 0◦. This orientation dependence characterizes
diatomic molecules with a HOMO of σg symmetry. We
also studied the orientation dependence of the harmonics
for the O2 molecule, where the HOMO has πg symmetry.
As in the case of N2, the quality of the wave functions,

used to model the O2 molecule was of importance, but
furthermore we observed some eﬀect of the nuclear mo-
tion on the harmonic emission. The πg symmetry of the
O2 molecule revealed itself through the angular depen-
dence of the harmonics. In the case of O2 the harmonic
generation was suppressed at orientations corresponding
to both perpendicular as well as parallel alignment of the
internuclear axis to the laser polarization. In support to
earlier work [7], our results show that it is mainly the
symmetry of the HOMO that determines the alignment
dependence of the HHG.

To conclude, we have presented a length gauge strong-
ﬁeld approximation for HHG in diatomic molecules. The
theory is very versatile and readily adapted to a wide
range of diatomic molecules, and straightforwardly gen-
eralized to polyatomic molecules. The agreement with
recent pump-probe experiments [11, 12] is excellent, and
hence we have conﬁdence in the predictive power of the
model. Despite the good agreement, it is clear that the
model poses important questions, in particular concern-
ing the fact that our model is formulated in the length
gauge. This seems to be advantageous for the initial ion-
ization step in order to obtain the correct orientation
dependence in the process, and it is also physically well-
justiﬁed since the ionization is tunneling like and the
escape into the continuum happens at large distances,
where the length gauge interaction has large weight [16].
The physics in the recombination step, however, is in
In this case an eﬀec-
a sense completely the opposite.

tive transfer of momentum has to take place between the
recombining electron and the core. Such a process is ex-
pected to be better described in the velocity gauge which
naturally probes regions in space where the electron ex-
periences abrupt changes (close to the nuclei).

Another point is the question of how to treat the nuclei.
The present formalism gives an attempt in that direction:
within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we applied
the Franck-Condon principle and observed signiﬁcant ef-
fects of the nuclear motion only for the lighter species H2,
and D2. If it holds true then nuclear motion is essentially
unimportant for all heavier systems, and it means that
we may think of the nuclei as stationary ﬁxed-in-space
objects setting up an eﬀective diﬀraction-like grating for
the backscattered electron. Of course the out-come of
the rescattering be it HHG or, e.g., future ionization,
will be highly sensitive to this spatial arrangement, and
this will undoubtedly lead to a higher degree of control
of the harmonics.

In this appendix we work out the asymptotic form of
the momentum space wave function of the HOMO and
describe, how this expression reduces to a well known
function around singular points [19]. We start out in the
body ﬁxed frame of the molecule with the z axis chosen
along the internuclear axis. The HOMO wave function in
position representation must then follow the asymptotic

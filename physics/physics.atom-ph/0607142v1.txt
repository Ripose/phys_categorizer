We investigate laser induced nonsequential multiple ionization using a simple statistical model in
which an electron recollides inelastically with its parent ion. In this collision, it thermalizes with
the remaining N − 1 bound electrons within a time interval ∆t. Subsequently, all the N electrons
leave. We address the question of how the above time delays inﬂuence the individual contributions
from the orbits in which the ﬁrst electron, upon return, is accelerated or decelerated by the ﬁeld,
respectively, to the ion momentum distributions. In both cases, the time delays modify the drift
momenta obtained by the N electrons when they reach the continuum at t + ∆t, by moving such
times towards or away from a crossing of the electric ﬁeld. The contributions from both types of
collisions are inﬂuenced in distinct ways, and the interplay between such trends determines the widths
and the peak momenta of the distributions. Speciﬁcally in the few-cycle pulse case, we also show
that such time delays do not aﬀect the shapes of the momentum distributions in a radical fashion.
Hence, even with a thermalization time ∆t, nonsequential multiple ionization could in principle be
used for absolute-phase diagnosis.

1 Introduction

The physics of non-sequential double ionization in rare gases by low-frequency,
intense laser ﬁelds is, to a very large extent, understood. In particular for neon,
the electron momentum distributions with peaks at non-vanishing momentum
Up, along the laser-ﬁeld polarization, or the
components p1|| = p2|| =
Up,
ion momentum distributions peaked at the parallel momenta P|| =
where Up denotes the ponderomotive energy, can be explained by a laser-
induced inelastic recollision process [1–3]. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst electron leaves
an atom by tunneling ionization at a time t′, propagates in the continuum,
being accelerated by the ﬁeld and, subsequently, at a time t, recollides with its
parent ion. The second electron is then freed by electron-impact ionization [4].

Speed-up and slow-down collisions in laser-induced nonsequential multiple ionization

This process has been successfully dealt with using an S-Matrix approach
and its classical counterpart [5–9]. In particular, if the laser-ﬁeld intensity is
high enough, both quantum-mechanical and classical models yield very simi-
lar momentum distributions1. We have shown that this agreement occurs for
several types of electron-electron interaction, and in the absence or presence
of Coulomb repulsion in the electron ﬁnal states [6–8]. Furthermore, we have
veriﬁed that the outcome of the classical and quantum mechanical computa-
tions also exhibit a striking agreement if the driving ﬁeld is a few-cycle laser
pulse [9, 12]. In particular, both the classical and quantum mechanical distri-
butions are strongly dependent on the so-called absolute phase, i.e., the phase
diﬀerence between the pulse envelope and its carrier oscillation. We have used
this fact in order to propose a scheme for diagnosing the absolute phase [12],
which has also been experimentally realized [13].

×

If one is dealing, however, with more than two active electrons, there are
many open questions concerning the physics behind laser-induced multiple
ionization. This is in particular true for triple and quadruple ionization of
neon by near infra-red (ω = 0.057 a.u.) laser ﬁelds in an intensity range be-
1015 W/cm2 [2, 14, 15]. The distributions observed in such experi-
low 2

ments, approximately peaked at non-vanishing ion momenta P|| =
where N denotes the number of electrons involved, hint at a non-sequential
physical mechanism. The theoretical modeling of non-sequential multi-electron
processes for N > 2, however, poses a far greater challenge than in the two-
electron case. For instance, already for three electrons, which is the simplest
scenario to be taken into consideration, one must include at least six Feyn-
man diagrams when computing the corresponding transition amplitude, each
of which is rather cumbersome to implement.

In order to tackle such a problem, in previous work [16], we constructed
a simple thermalization model, similar to those employed in, for instance,
nuclear [17] or molecular [18] physics. We assumed that the ﬁrst electron,
upon return, recollides with its parent ion and shares its kinetic energy with
1 bound electrons. All the N electrons are then freed after a time interval
N
∆t subsequent to the recollision time t, which, to ﬁrst approximation, is taken
to be constant. We regard this time as the upper bound for a thermalization
time, which is necessary for the kinetic energy to be redistributed among the
N electrons.

The above-mentioned process takes place within a fraction of the cycle of the
laser ﬁeld. Since the duration of a typical titanium-sapphire pulse, employed
in such experiments, is of the order of 2.7 f s, ∆t falls within the attosecond

1This, however, no longer holds if the intensity is near threshold, i.e., just enough for the second
electron to be released. For a detailed discussion c.f. [10], and for measurements of nonsequential
double ionization below the threshold see, e.g., [11].

regime. Indeed, recently, by comparing our thermalization model with the
available experimental data for triple and fourfold ionization of neon [14,15], we
have been able to estimate thermalization times of the order of 460 attoseconds
[16]. Using such a time delay, we computed ion momentum distributions whose
widths and peak momenta agreed very well with those in the experiments.

To a very large extent, our thermalization model contains classical ingre-
dients and is a generalization of the classical model already employed in the
two-electron case [7, 8]. In [16], we have also observed that the peaks and the
width of the momentum distributions depend very strongly on the time de-
lay ∆t. The position of the peaks is a direct consequence of the kinematics
involved in the process, as the ﬁnal drift momentum the N electrons acquire
from the ﬁeld, will strongly depend on the time t + ∆t when they reach the
continuum.

The above-stated physical mechanism, however, is not completely agreed
upon. Indeed, it could well be that a broadening in the electron momentum
distributions and the displacement in the peak momenta are caused by, for
instance, partially sequential ionization processes [15], or excitation tunnel-
ing mechanisms [19] , in which, during the recollision, the electrons undergo
a transition to an excited state, from which they subsequently tunnel (for
an example of such mechanisms for diﬀerent atomic species see, e.g., [20]).
Speciﬁcally for large thermalization times, the distributions are very much
concentrated near vanishing parallel momenta, and resemble those obtained
with excitation-tunneling. Apart from that, even assuming that thermaliza-
tion through electron-impact ionization is the only or at least the dominant
physical mechanism, it is not clear how the time delay ∆t aﬀects the width of
the distributions.

Another open question concerns the inﬂuence of the types of collisions on
the momentum distributions. In fact, for the recombination or rescattering
phenomena occurring in the context of atoms in strong laser ﬁelds, there exist
two main orbits along which an electron may return to its parent ion with the
same kinetic energy. Such orbits are known as “the long orbit”, or “the short
orbit”, and have been extensively investigated in the context of high-order
harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization [21] and, more recently,
for nonsequential double ionization [22, 23]. An electron following the long
orbit leaves the atom at a time t′ < 0.3T , where T = 2π/ω denotes a ﬁeld
cycle, and returns after the minimum of the electric ﬁeld, whereas an electron
along the short orbit reaches the continuum at t′ > 0.3T and returns before
the minimum of the electric ﬁeld. Hence, in the former and in the latter case
the returning electron is decelerated and accelerated by the ﬁeld, respectively.
In recent years, both orbits have been investigated in the context of non-
sequential double ionization using classical ensemble models [22]. In particular,
they have been associated to two main types of collisions. The orbits for which

4

Speed-up and slow-down collisions in laser-induced nonsequential multiple ionization

the electron is being decelerated have been related to the so-called “slow-down
collisions”, whereas the short orbit has been linked to the so-called “speed-up
collisions”. Depending on several parameters, such as the ﬁeld intensity or
frequency, one type of collisions may provide the dominant contributions to
the yield, or both types may be equally important [27]. For instance, for the
parameters in [22], it was shown that the slow-down collisions dominate.

In this paper, we address the question of how the contributions from the
short and the long orbit to the multiple-ionization momentum distributions
are aﬀected by the time delay ∆t, for triple and fourfold ionization. We are
mainly concerned with the inﬂuence of both sets of orbits on the width and
the peaks of the ion momentum distributions, for resolved and non-resolved
ion momentum components transverse to the laser-ﬁeld polarization. We take
the driving ﬁeld to be a monochromatic wave or a few-cycle pulse, and make
a detailed analysis of the similarities and diﬀerences between both cases. This
manuscript is organized as follows: In the subsequent section, we provide a
brief discussion of our thermalization model, with the explicit expressions for
the ion momentum distributions. In Sec. 3, we display our results for the
diﬀerent sets of orbits, together with the total yields and, ﬁnally, in Sec. 4, we
state our conclusions.

2 Model

We will brieﬂy recall the statistical model employed in our previous publica-
tion [16], in order to determine the momentum distributions in N-fold non-
sequential ionization. This model is mainly composed by three main ingredi-
ents.

Firstly, we assume that one electron tunnels into the continuum at an instant

t′ according to the quasi-static rate [25].

denote the electric ﬁeld at the time the electron left and

Subsequently, this electron propagates under the sole inﬂuence of the laser
ﬁeld, and obeys the classical equations of motion. At a later time t, it may be
driven back towards its parent ion, recolliding inelastically with it. The return
condition r1(t) = 0 for the ﬁrst electron yields

clear geometrical picture for the return condition: for a given t′, the return
time t is given by the intersection of F (t) with its tangent at t′ [26]. We will
employ this construction in Sec. 3, when discussing our results (c.f. Fig. 2).

Upon recollision, the energy Eret(t) = [A(t)

space. We will consider here that the time delay ∆t is constant. Finally, at the

employing an adequate choice of ﬁeld and atomic parameters, such as, for
instance, a few-cycle pulse, one can manipulate the radius in (4), making
whole momentum regions collapse or appear. In [9, 12], we have exploited this
in the two-electron case in order to determine the absolute phase.

P

The only free parameter of this model is the time delay ∆t between the rec-
ollision time and the time when multiple ionization occurs. It is the sum of the
time it takes to establish the statistical ensemble, i.e., the thermalization time,
and a possible additional “dwell time”, until the electrons become free. This
model is an extension to NSMI of a classical model introduced for NSDI in
Refs. [7, 8] for ∆t = 0. Suﬃciently high above threshold, it produced momen-
tum distributions that were virtually indistinguishable from their quantum-
mechanical counterparts.

holds for ∆EN,ionk⊥. In our computations, we consider the shortest pair of
trajectories along which the ﬁrst electron returns to its parent ion, and, in
particular, the individual contributions from the longer and the shorter orbit
within such a pair. Such orbits coalesce at the boundary of the region deter-
mined by the hypershpere (4) for which, classically, nonsequential multiple
ionization is allowed to occur. In the particular model employed in this paper,
such a boundary is determined by the minimal momenta the N electrons need
in order to overcome the binding energy E(N )
, and the maximal momenta for
which the ﬁrst electron is able to return.

In Fig. 1, we display the yield computed assuming that the ﬁrst electron
returns to its parent ion either along the long or the short orbit, together
with the total momentum distributions, for triple ionization of neon. In the
upper panel [Fig. 1.(a)], the thermalization time is taken to be vanishing. As

distributions which are slightly shifted towards lower momenta, in comparison
to those from the longer orbit. Such a shift is corrected if a time delay ∆t =
0.05T is introduced [Fig. 1.(b)]. This can be easily understood in terms of
the momentum transfer from the ﬁeld to the electrons. Such a momentum
transfer is maximal if all electrons leave at a crossing of the ﬁeld, i.e., for
t + ∆t = nπ. For vanishing time delay, the electrons released by a speed up
collision, i.e., by an electron returning along the short orbit, leave at roughly
tS = 0.95T , while for the slow-down collisions, this happens at tL = 1.05T .
The time delay ∆t = 0.05T moves the release times ts + ∆t for the short-orbit
contributions towards the crossing and their long-orbit counterparts ts + ∆t
away from it. As a direct consequence, the contributions from the former set
of orbits move towards higher absolute momenta, while those from the latter
set move towards lower absolute momenta.

If the time delay increases [Fig. 1.(c)], the peak momenta from the short-
orbit contributions starts to move again towards lower absolute values. This is
due to the fact that, for ∆t > 0.05T , the time tS + ∆t all electrons leave starts
to move away from the crossing of the driving ﬁeld. Hence, the drift momenta
of the electrons freed by the speed-up collisions decrease. One should note,
however, that the times tL + ∆t, for the electrons released by the slow-down
collisions, also move farther away from the crossing. In this latter case, how-
ever, the peak momenta decrease in a far more radical way. The fact that the
two individual contributions are now peaked at momenta which are very far
apart leads to a broadening in the momentum distributions. In this context,
it is worth mentioning that the time delay ∆t = 0.17T yields the best agree-
ment with the experimental ﬁndings, for nonsequential triple and quadruple
ionization [14, 15]. This issue is discussed in more detail in [16].

For exceptionally large time delays, such as those depicted in Fig. 1.(d),
the contributions from the short orbit move back to lower momenta, and those
from the long orbit overlap at vanishing ion momenta. As a direct consequence,
the total yield merges in a single peak at vanishing momentum. Such features
resemble to a very large extent those obtained if one considers sequential
physical mechanisms, or the situation where the electrons undergo a transition
to an excited state, and, subsequently, tunnel into the continuum. One should
note, however, that for such a parameter range, there is poor agreement with
the experimental results.

The eﬀect observed in Fig. 1 is shown in more detail in Fig. 2, using the
tangent construction mentioned in the previous section. In the ﬁgure, we con-
sider the return condition (2) for the short and long orbits. For vanishing time
delays, the electron starting at t′
L releases the remaining electrons at
the times tS before or tL after the crossing of the ﬁeld, respectively. Such times
are determined by the intersection of the tangents (2) with the dashed line. If,
however, there is a time delay ∆t, the time t + ∆t in which all electrons leave

In Fig. 3, we depict the contributions from the slow-down and the speed-up
collisions, as well as from the total yield, for the quadruple-ionization case and
the same time delays as in Fig. 1. They exhibit the same overall behavior as
in Fig. 1: the peak momenta for the short-orbit contributions moves towards
higher absolute values for ∆t = 0.05T [Fig. 3.(b)], and, as ∆t is further
increased, the peak momenta start to decrease [Fig. 3.(c)]. The maxima of
the long-orbit contributions always shift towards Pk = 0, for increasing ∆t,
as shown in Fig. 3.(b)-(d). This behavior is expected, since within our model,
both triple and quadruple nonsequential ionization are governed by the same
physical mechanism, namely energy transfer to all active electrons due to the
recollision of the ﬁrst electron with its parent ion. The main diﬀerence is
the fact that all electrons must overcome a larger energy E(4)
in order to
0
reach the continuum. Therefore, for the same laser-ﬁeld intensity, as the charge
state increases, the radius of the hypersphere (4) decreases and so does the
momentum region for which the process in question occurs. Furthermore, the
Up. This leads, in
peak momenta should increase to the vicinity of P|| =
general, to distributions which are much more localized around the maxima
than in the triple-ionization case.

For a time delay ∆t = 0.25T, however, instead of a single peak at vanishing
momenta, the total distribution exhibits a plateau, with humps near its low-
and high-energy ends [Fig. 3 .(d)] . This is due to the fact that, while the region
near P|| = 0 is ﬁlled by the contributions from the long orbit, the contributions
from the short orbit are still at a much larger momenta than in the two electron

case, and still cause such humps. However, the distributions from the negative
and positive momentum regions still merge, as in the triple-ionization case.

Finally, in Fig. 4, we analyze the individual contributions of both orbits if
the transverse momenta are only partly integrated over, for time delays ∆t = 0
and ∆t = 0.17T . The distributions from the short and the long orbits exhibit
a displacement in their peak momenta which is similar to those obtained in
the non-resolved case. In particular, the elongation observed in experiments
for such distributions is directly related to this displacement.

the total yield for vanishing time delay is given for comparison. The ion momenta are given in
atomic units.

where φ is the absolute phase, and n is the number of cycles. We choose a
four-cycle pulse (n = 4), and consider triple and quadruple ionization. Apart
from their wide range of applications (for reviews see, e.g., [24]), few-cycle
pulses are very attractive in the context of nonsequential multiple ionization.
This is due to the fact that several physical mechanisms which would compete
with electron-impact ionization, such as excitation-tunneling ionization, are
strongly suppressed in the few-cycle case [14]. Therefore, in principle, one
expects cleaner measurements.

In Fig. 5, we present ion momentum distributions for triple ionization of
neon, computed with the driving ﬁeld (12). As a starting point, we take the
thermalization time ∆t to be vanishing. In contrast to the monochromatic
case, such distributions are in general asymmetric with respect to Pk = 0.
This is expected since, for a few cycle pulse, A(t) =
A(t + nT /2) holds,

Figure 5.

Ion momentum distribution of nonsequential triple ionization of neon by a four cycle

pulse of intensity I = 2 × 1015W/cm2, and several absolute phases φ. We assume that the electrons
leave instantaneously after recollision (∆t = 0). The ion momenta are given in units of [Up]1/2.

ing on the absolute phase, the distributions are strongly localized in either the
positive or negative momentum region. Around a critical phase, they start to
shift from one momentum region to the other.

Such a behavior is very similar to that observed for nonsequential double
ionization (N = 2). In the two-electron case, this shift has been employed
to diagnose the absolute phase [9, 12, 13]. Furthermore, it has been explained
as a change in the dominant set of trajectories for an electron rescattering
with its parent ion. Such a set is determined by the interplay between the
rate (1) with which the ﬁrst electron is released in the continuum, and the
available phase space: if there was a large probability for the ﬁrst electron to
leave along a particular set of orbits, and if it returned with enough energy
to cause appreciable electron-impact ionization, one expects the contributions
from such orbits to the yield to be large.

Within the present model, this explanation also holds for N > 2, and is
illustrated in Fig. 6 for the parameter set of Fig. 5. In the upper and lower
panels, we present the quasi-static tunneling rate and parallel momentum com-
ponents for the residual ion, respectively, as functions of the emission time t′.
In the latter case, we consider the transverse ionic momentum components to
be vanishing. This gives an upper bound for the momentum region for which
electron-impact ionization is allowed to occur, since, in Eq. (5), the eﬀective

14

is minimal.

In the ﬁgure, we identify at least three sets of orbits, whose start times t′
are highly dependent on the carrier-envelope phase φ. For instance, for φ = 0,
there exist three such pairs: (1, 2), (3, 4) and (5, 6). Thereby, the odd and
even numbers refer to the longer and the shorter orbit in a pair, respectively.
Orbits (1, 2) and (5, 6) contribute to the yield in the positive momentum re-
gion, whereas (3, 4) leads to a peak in the region Pk < 0. Since, for (1, 2), the
quasi-static rate (1) is very small, the contributions from this set of orbits is
negligible. Hence, the features observed in Fig. 5 will be determined by the
remaining two pairs. In fact, orbits (3, 4) and (5, 6) lead to the large peak for
negative momenta and to the small peak for positive momenta, respectively.
For the set (3, 4), there is a large momentum region for which the ﬁrst electron
may dislodge the remaining two, and a non-negligible ionization rate. There-
fore, its contributions to the yield are expected to be quite prominent. For the
set (5, 6), even though the tunneling rate is very large, there is only a small
region for which electron-impact ionization is allowed. Hence, the pair (3, 4)
dominates.

This picture starts to change around the critical phase φc = 0.3π, for which
the yield is approximately symmetric. In comparison to the case φ = 0, there
is now a decrease in the quasi-static rate for (3, 4) and an increase in the mo-
mentum region for (5, 6). Therefore, the contributions from the former orbits
decrease and those from the latter orbits increase, respectively. Beyond the
critical phase (for instance, for φ = 0.8π), the yield is mainly concentrated in
the positive momentum region, since now (5, 6) prevail. For this latter case,
there is also a further set of orbits which contribute to the yield in the region
Pk < 0, namely (7, 8). For such a set, the rate (1) is very large. However, the
region for which electron-impact ionization is allowed to occur is very small
and (5, 6) is still the dominant pair of orbits.

For a higher charge state, the very same line of argumentation applies. The
main diﬀerence is that the ﬁrst electron will need to overcome a larger binding
energy in order to release the remaining electrons. As a direct consequence, the
radius of the hypersphere (4) will be smaller so that whole momentum regions
may collapse, or contribute in a much less pronounced way to the yield. For
instance, for nonsequential quadruple ionization, for the absolute phase φ = 0
the small peak on the positive momentum region is absent. This is due to the
fact that the momentum space for the orbits (5, 6) is much smaller than in
the three-electron case, so that their contributions to the yield are negligible.
For φ = 0.8π, we have also observed that the small peak in the negative
momentum region is not present, for the same reason.

We now consider non-vanishing thermalization times and a constant abso-
lute phase, which has been chosen so that the yield is almost entirely concen-
trated in the negative momentum region. The results of these computations

width and the position of the peaks of the distributions. They do not modify,
however, their asymmetric shapes or the momentum region the yield is con-
centrated. This is due to the fact that a non-vanishing ∆t changes the drift
momenta the N electrons acquire from the external laser ﬁeld when they reach

the quasi-static tunneling rate (1) or the binding energy the electrons must

pairs of orbits remain the same. In other words, by changing ∆t one inﬂuences
the center of the hypersphere (4), but not its radius.

and the short orbits. For a few-cycle pulse, we deﬁne such orbits with respect
to the pair which gives dominant contributions to the yield. For this speciﬁc
parameter set, this means orbits (3, 4) in Fig. 6. The long- and short-orbit
contributions, i.e., the individual contributions from orbits 3 and 4, respec-
tively, behave in a similar way to the monochromatic-ﬁeld case (Figs. 1 and

from the slow-down collisions are peaked at a slightly larger absolute momen-
tum than those from the short orbit. For ∆t = 0.1T [Fig. 8.(b)], the former
and the latter contributions have moved away from or towards Pk = 0, re-
spectively. Once more, as the thermalization time increases, the peaks of both
contributions shift towards vanishing ion momenta, as shown in Fig. 8.(c).

A qualitative diﬀerence, however, between Fig. 8 and its monochromatic
counterpart is that, for large time delays, one no longer obtains a plateau
in the vicinity of vanishing ion momenta, but a single peak in the negative
momentum region. This is due to the fact that, for a monochromatic driving
ﬁeld, the symmetric peaks in the positive and negative momentum regions
start to merge. For a few-cycle driving pulse, on the other hand, by taking an
appropriate absolute phase, the distributions can be chosen in such a way that
they are concentrated only in one momentum region. Hence, it is possible to
avoid that a plateau or a single peak occurs near Pk = 0.

4 Conclusions

We have investigated the inﬂuence of the shorter and the longer orbit of an
electron recolliding inelastically with its parent ion on ion momentum distribu-
fold
tions, within the context of a thermalization model for laser-induced N
nonsequential ionization. In this model, the ﬁrst electron, upon recollision,
shares the kinetic energy it acquired from the external laser ﬁeld with the
remaining N
1 bound electrons. All N electrons then leave after a time in-
terval ∆t. We have taken the driving ﬁeld to be a monochromatic wave and a

few-cycle laser pulse.

We have traced the variations in the widths and peaks of such momentum
distributions, with respect to the time delays ∆t, back to the momentum
transfer from the ﬁeld to an electron traveling along the short or the long orbit,
and recolliding with its parent ion. The momentum transfer is maximal at a
crossing of the electric ﬁeld. With increasing time delays, the time for which
the electrons released by a slow-down collision, i.e., by an electron moving
along the long orbit, will leave their parent ion moves away from this crossing.
As a direct consequence, the momentum transfer will decrease and the peak
momenta will move towards lower absolute values. The situation is however
quite diﬀerent for the electrons released by a speed up collision. In this case,
following the increase of time delay, the release time t + ∆t will initially (i.e.,
for ∆t
0.05T ) approach a crossing, and subsequently (i.e., for ∆t > 0.05T )
move away from it. This will make the peaks of the pertinent momentum
distributions move to larger absolute values, and then back towards Pk = 0.
The width of the resulting total momentum distributions, as well as their

≤

peaks, will result from the interplay between such trends. This also explains
the elongated patterns observed for the momentum distributions, in case the
perpendicular momentum of the ion is resolved.

In both monochromatic and few-cycle cases, we considered the dominant
pair of orbits, which, for each situation, is chosen in a slightly diﬀerent way.
For monochromatic ﬁelds, we took the two shortest trajectories, i.e., those for
which the ﬁrst electron spends the shortest time in the continuum. Physically,
this pair is dominant, since the spreading of the electronic wave packet is less
pronounced than for longer pairs of orbits. Hence, the overlap with bound-
state wave packets will be appreciable1. In the few-cycle case, the dominant
pair is determined by the interplay between the tunneling rate (1) for the
ﬁrst electron and the available momentum space. A pair of orbits will only
contribute in a relevant way to the yield if the ﬁrst electron is ejected with
a large probability and if, upon return, it has enough energy to release the
second electron (see, e.g. [9, 12], for more details).

Speciﬁcally for few-cycle pulses, we have shown that non-vanishing thermal-
ization times do not play a very important role in determining the shape of
the momentum distributions. This is due to the fact that a time delay ∆t
= 0
between recollision and multiple ionization only alters the drift momenta the
N electrons acquire from the ﬁeld when they reach the continuum. However,
this delay does not modify the key ingredients which determine the dominant
pairs of orbits and therefore the shape of the momentum distributions: the
tunneling rate for the ﬁrst electron and its kinetic energy upon return. In par-
ticular, both ingredients are highly dependent on the carrier-envelope phase,
so that the shape of the momentum distributions can be used for measuring
this parameter [12, 13]. This means that, even in case there is a non-vanishing
thermalization time, one could, in principle, still employ nonsequential mul-
tiple ionization for absolute-phase diagnosis. Finally, few-cycle driving pulses
may be very useful for testing and validating the thermalization model fur-
ther, since many other ionization channels, such as excitation-tunneling or
sequential ionization, are strongly suppressed in this case.

1We would like to stress out that wave-packet spreading is not included in our classical model. It
is, however, present in the quantum-mechanical model we have employed in the two-electron case,
which is its quantum-mechanical counterpart. In this latter case and as expected from our physical
intuition, we veriﬁed that the main contributions to the yield come from the shortest pair.

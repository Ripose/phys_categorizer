Abstract

We present an improved calculation of higher order corrections to the one-
loop self energy of 2P states in hydrogen-like systems with small nuclear
charge Z. The method is based on a division of the integration with respect
to the photon energy into a high and a low energy part. The high energy
part is calculated by an expansion of the electron propagator in powers of the
Coulomb ﬁeld. The low energy part is simpliﬁed by the application of a Foldy-
Wouthuysen transformation. This transformation leads to a clear separation
of the leading contribution from the relativistic corrections and removes higher
order terms. The method is applied to the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states in atomic
hydrogen. The results lead to new theoretical values for the Lamb shifts and
the ﬁne structure splitting.

I. INTRODUCTION

The evaluation of the one-loop self-energy of a bound electron is a long standing problem
in Quantum Electrodynamics. There are mainly two approaches. The ﬁrst, developed by P.
Mohr [1], relies on a multidimensional numerical integral involving a partial wave expansion
of the electron propagator in the Coulomb ﬁeld. This approach is particularly useful for
heavy hydrogen-like ions. The second approach is based on an expansion of the electron
self-energy in powers of Z α,

δESE =

α
π

(Zα)4 m F ,

where

F = A40 + A41 lnh(Zα)−2i + (Zα) A50 +

(Zα)2(cid:16)A60 + A61 lnh(Zα)−2i + A62 ln2h(Zα)−2i + o(Zα)(cid:17) .

(1)

(2)

The leading contribution as given by A41 has been originally calculated by Bethe in [2].
Many others have contributed to the evaluation of higher orders corrections, for details see
an excellent review by Sapirstein and Yennie in [3]. A very general analytical method has
been introduced by Erickson and Yennie in [4]. Erickson and Yennie were able to calculate all
the coeﬃcients in (2) except for A60. The calculation of corrections of (Z α)2 relative order is
a highly nontrivial task because the binding Coulomb ﬁeld enters in a nonperturbative way,
and there is no closed form expression for the Dirac-Coulomb propagator. Additionally, one-
loop electron self-energy contributes to all orders in Z α, and the separation of the (Z α)2
relative contribution involves hundreds of terms. A very eﬃcient scheme of the calculation
has been introduced in [5]. It was calculated there the A60 coeﬃcient for the 1S and 2S
states in hydrogen atom. The method was based on the division of the whole expression
into two parts, EL and EH , by introducing an artiﬁcial parameter ǫ which is a cutoﬀ in the
photon frequency. In the high energy part EH one expands the electron propagator in powers
of the Coulomb ﬁeld and uses Feynman gauge. In the low energy part one uses Coulomb
gauge and applies a multipole expansion. The most important ingredient of this method is
the expansion in the parameter ǫ after the expansion in Z α is performed (for details see the
next section).

The calculation presented in this paper is a further development of this original method.
In the low energy part we use a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The transformation
clearly identiﬁes the leading order contribution and separates out all higher order terms.
An additional advantage is that the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger-Coulomb propagator can
be used here. A closed-form expression of this propagator is known in coordinate and in
momentum space (for details see [6]). This method is applied to the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states.
All coeﬃcients including A60 are obtained. We recover all the previously known results, and
the new results for A60 are in agreement with those obtained from the extrapolation of
P. Mohr’s data. Our results are relevant for single electron, small Z systems (for example
atomic hydrogen and He+), which are currently investigated with very high precision. New
theoretical values for the Lamb shift of the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states and the ﬁne structure
summarize our calculations.

II. THE ǫfw-METHOD

The self-interaction of the electron leads to a shift of the hydrogen energy levels. This

shift at the one-loop level is given by

δESE = ie2Z

d4k
(2π)4 Dµν(k)h ¯ψ|γµ

1

6 p− 6 k − m − γ0V

γν|ψi − h ¯ψ|δm|ψi,

(3)

where δm refers to the mass counter term, and it is understood that the photon propagator
Dµν has to be regularized to prevent ultraviolet divergences. ¯ψ is the Dirac adjoint ¯ψ = ψ+ γ0.
For the ω-integration (k0 ≡ ω), the lower part of the Feynman integration contour CF is
bent into the “right” half plane with ℜ(ω) > 0 and divided into two parts, the low energy
contour CL and the high energy contour CH, see Fig. 1. The ǫ parameter corresponds to the
cut-oﬀ K which was introduced by H. Bethe in his original evaluation of the low energy part
of the electromagnetic shift of energy levels [2] (speciﬁcally, K = ǫ m). The two contours are
separated along the line ℜ(ω) = ǫ m, where ǫ is some arbitrary dimensionless parameter,
which we assume to be smaller than unity. This method of ω-integration has been described
in detail in [5]. The two integrations lead to the high and low energy parts EL and EH,
which are functions of the ﬁne structure constant α and of the free parameter ǫ. Their sum,
however,

δESE(α) = EL(α, ǫ) + EH(α, ǫ),

(4)

does not depend on ǫ. The most important step is the expansion in ǫ after the expansion in
α. It eliminates, without actual calculations, many terms that vanish in the limit ǫ → 0. To
be more speciﬁc, in expanding EL and EH in ǫ we keep only ﬁnite terms (the ǫ0-coeﬃcients)
and the terms which diverge as ǫ → 0. The divergent terms cancel out in the sum, the ﬁnite
terms contribute to the Lamb shift. This cancelation of the divergent terms is an important
cross-check of the calculation. One may use diﬀerent gauges of the photon propagator for the
two parts, because the gauge-dependent term vanishes in the limit ǫ → 0. For convenience,
we use the Feynman gauge for the high and the Coulomb gauge for the low energy part.
In this work, the treatment of the low energy part is largely simpliﬁed by the introduc-
tion of a Foldy-Wouthuysen (fw) transformation. It enables one to clearly separate out the
leading (nonrelativistic dipole) term, which gives the α(Zα)4-contribution, from the rela-
tivistic corrections, which give terms in α(Zα)6. An additional advantage is the fact that all
contributions to the low energy part can be evaluated using the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger-
Coulomb-Green’s function, whose closed-form solution is well known [6]. Terms which con-
tribute to the Lamb shift up to α(Zα)6 can be readily identiﬁed, and each of these can be
calculated independently. In the low energy part we may expand in the photon momentum
k. The terms which contribute to the Lamb shift in the order of α(Zα)6 correspond to the
“non-relativistic dipole” term (involving the non-relativistic propagator and wave function),
the “non-relativistic quadrupole” term and the “relativistic dipole” term (which involves the
relativistic corrections to the wave function and the Dirac-Coulomb propagator). The terms
of higher order in k vanishes in the limit ǫ → 0.
Calculations of the high-energy part are performed almost entirely with the computer
algebra system Mathematica [7]. Because of the presence of an infrared cut-oﬀ, one can
expand the Dirac-Coulomb propagator in powers of the Coulomb potential. A subsequent

3

expansion of the propagator in electron momenta is also performed. This leads ﬁnally to the
calculation of matrix elements of operators containing V and p on the P-states. Because
P -wave functions vanish at the origin, all of the relevant matrix elements are ﬁnite up to
the order of (Zα)6.

III. THE HIGH-ENERGY PART

In this part we use the Feynman gauge (Dµν(k) = −gµν/k2). and the Pauli-Villars

regularization for the photon propagator

1
k2 →

k2 −

k2 − M 2 ,

so that the following expression remains to be evaluated:

k2 − M 2(cid:21)h ¯ψ|γµ

(6)

We start by calculating the matrix element

˜P = h ¯ψ|γµ

1

6 p− 6 k − m − γ0V

γµ|ψi

(7)

up to the order of (Zα)6. The ﬁrst step in the evaluation of ˜P is the expansion of the matrix

M = γµ

1

6 p− 6 k − m − γ0V

γµ

in powers of the binding ﬁeld. We denote the denominator of the free electron propagator
by D (D =6 p− 6 k − m). Realizing that the binding ﬁeld V = −(Zα)2 m/ρ carries two powers
of (Zα) (with ρ = r/aBohr), we expand the matrix M up to V 3, which leads in turn to four
matrices, denoted Mi,
M0 = γµ 1

with M = M0 + M1 + M2 + M3 + O((Zα)7). Deﬁning ˜Pi = h ¯ψ|Mi|ψi, we write the element
˜P as the sum

˜P = ˜P0 + ˜P1 + ˜P2 + ˜P3 + O((Zα)7).

(9)

This expansion corresponds to a division of the initial expression into 0-,1-,2- and 3-vertex
parts. We then expand each of the matrices Mi into the standard 16 Γ matrices, which form
a basis set of 4 × 4 matrices.

The expansion coeﬃcients ci,β are rational functions of the binding ﬁeld, the electron and
photon energy and momenta. They can therefore be expanded in powers of α, leaving none
of the electron momentum operators in the denominator. Next, we evaluate the matrix
elements of these operators with the relativistic (Dirac) wave function ψ. It is a property
of P states, which vanish at the origin, that up to order (Zα)6, all of the desired matrix
elements are ﬁnite.

As an example, we describe here the evaluation of the three-vertex matrix element ˜P3 =
h ¯ψ|M3|ψi. It takes on the same values for both 2P states. Expanding M3 into the 16 Γ-
matrices, we ﬁnd that up to order (Zα)6, all expansion coeﬃcients vanish except for the
identity Id and γ0-matrices. The expansion coeﬃcients are explicitly

c3,Id = 16V 3 k2 − k2 ω − 4 ω + 3 ω2 + 2

(k2 + 2 ω − ω2)4

≡ b3,IdV 3,

(11)

where k = |k| and for simplicity m = 1, and

c3,γ 0 = 2 V 3 k4 − 8 k2 + 12 k2 ω + 16 ω − 6 k2ω2 − 12 ω2 + 4 ω3 − ω4 − 8

(k2 + 2 ω − ω2)4

≡ b3,γ 0V 3.

(12)

So up to order (Zα)6, the two c-expansion coeﬃcients are (except for their dependence on
k and ω) functions of the binding ﬁeld only. Thus, the matrix element ˜P3 is given by

˜P3 = b3,Idh ¯ψ|V 3|ψi + b3,γ 0h ¯ψ|γ0V 3|ψi.

The relevant matrix element of the wave function is

h ¯ψ|V 3|ψi = h ¯ψ|γ0V 3|ψi = −

1
24

(Zα)6 m3 + O((Zα)7).

(13)

(14)

where the ﬁrst equality holds only in the order of (Z α)6. The above matrix elements take
on the same values for the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states because the radial parts of both 2P states
are the same in the non-relativistic limit.

For the other vertex parts, many more terms appear, and the matrix elements contribute

in the lower order also. We give one example here, to be evaluated for the 1-vertex part,

and

(15)

(16)

For a more detailed review of the calculations see [8]. Having calculated ˜P , we subtract the
mass-counter-term before integrating with respect to k and ω. The ﬁnal k and ω integration
is performed in the following way. Those terms which appear to be ultraviolet divergent are
regularized and integrated covariantly using Feynman parameter approach. The remaining
terms are integrated with respect to k by residual integration and with respect to ω by
changing the integration variable to

√2 m ω − ω2 − iω

(17)

This integration procedure is described in details in [5]. The ﬁnal results for the high-energy-

IV. THE LOW ENERGY PART

In this part we are dealing with low energy virtual photons, therefore we treat the binding
ﬁeld non-pertubatively. Choosing the Coulomb gauge for the photon propagator, one ﬁnds
that only the spatial elements of this propagator contribute. The ω-integration along CL is
performed ﬁrst, which leads to the following expression for EL,

EL = −e2Z|k|<ǫ

d3k

(2π)3 2|k|

δT,ijhψ|αiei k · r

1

HD − (Eψ − ω)

αje−i k · r|ψi

(ω ≡ |k|).

(20)

HD denotes the Dirac-Coulomb-Hamiltonian, δT is the transverse delta function, and αi
refers to the Dirac α-matrices. In the matrix element

P ij = hψ|αiei k · r

1

HD − (Eψ − ω)

αje−i k · r|ψi

we introduce a unitary Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation U,

P ij = hUψ|(U αiei k · r U +)

1

U (HD − (Eψ − ω)) U + (U αje−i k · r U +)|Uψi.

(21)

(22)

The lower components of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformed Dirac wave function ψ vanish
up to (Zα)2, so that we may approximate |Uψi by

|Uψi = |φi + |δφi with hφ|δφi = 0,

(23)

where |φi is the nonrelativistic (Schr¨odinger-Pauli) wave function, and |δφi is the relativistic
correction.
We deﬁne an operator acting on the spinors as even if it does not mix upper and lower
components of spinors, and we call the odd operator odd if it mixes upper and lower com-
ponents. The Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian consists of even operators only. For the upper
left 2 × 2 submatrix of this Hamiltonian, we have the result [9]

HFW = U (HD − (Eψ − ω)) U + = m + HS + δH,

(24)

6

where HS refers to the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian, and δH is is the relativistic correction,

δH = −

(25)

Now we turn to the calculation of the Foldy-Wouhuysen transform of the operators
αi exp (k · r). The expression U αi exp (ik · r) U + is to be calculated. Assuming that ω = |k|
is of the order O((Zα)2), we may expand the expression U αi eik · r U + in powers of (Zα).
The result of the calculation is

U αieik · r U + = αi(cid:18)1 + i (k · r) −

In the limit ǫ → 0 the odd operators in the above expression do not contribute to the self
energy in (Z α)2 relative order, so one can neglect the odd operators. It can be shown easily
that also the last term in the above expression (proportional to k × Σ) does not contribute
to the Lamb shift in (Zα)2 relative order for ǫ → 0.
Because we can ignore odd operators, and because the lower components of the Foldy-
Wouthuysen transformed wave function vanish, we keep only the upper left 2× 2 submatrix
of Eq. (26), and we write U αi eik · rU + as

U αieik · r U + ≃

This can be rewritten as

U αi eik · r U + =

eik · r + δyi,

(27)

(28)

where δyi is of order (Zα)3. It is understood that the term pi
m eik · r is also expanded up to
the order (Zα)3. Denoting by E the Schr¨odinger energy (E = −(Zα)2 m/8 for 2P states)
and by δE the ﬁrst relativistic correction to E, we can thus write the matrix element P ij as

P ij = hφ + δφ|" pi

In this expression, the leading term and the (ﬁrst) relativistic corrections can be readily
identiﬁed. Spurious lower order terms are not present in Eq. (29). By expansion of the
denominator HS − (E − ω) + δH − δE in powers of α, the whole expression can be written
in a form which involves only the Schr¨odinger-Coulomb-Green’s function

7

G(E − ω) =

HS − (E − ω)

,

(30)

whose closed-form expression in coordinate space is given in Eq. (33). We now deﬁne the
dimensionless quantity

P =

m
2

δT,ij P ij.

(31)

Using the symmetry of the P -wave functions and Eq. (29), we easily see that P can be
written, up to (Zα)2, as the sum of the contributions (32, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43). The leading
contribution (the “non-relativistic dipole”) is given by

Pnd =

(32)

The evaluation of this matrix element is described here as an example. For the Schr¨odinger-
Coulomb propagator, we use the following coordinate-space representation [6],

G(r1, r2, E − ω) = Xl,m

gl(r1, r2, ν) Yl,m (ˆr1) Y ∗

(34)

where a = aBohr = 1/(αm), and (k)c is the Pochhammer symbol. The evaluation of eq. (32)
proceeds in the following steps: The angular integration is performed ﬁrst. Secondly, the
remaining integrals over r1 and r2 are evaluated using the formula (see e.g. [10]),

The summations lead to hypergeometric functions in the result,

For almost all of the matrix elements we use the coordinate-space representation of the
Schr¨odinger-Coulomb propagator given in Eq. (33). There are two exceptions: For the non-
relativististic quadrupole, we use Schwinger’s momentum space representation and carry out
the calculation in momentum space. A rather involved contribution is

to rewrite them to the form that contain only one propagator with modiﬁed parameters.
Namely, to the desired order in (Zα), the expression with two propagators can be replaced
by an expression with just one propagator, in which an (Zα)2-correction is added to the
angular momentum parameter l or to the ﬁne structure constant α in the radial part of the
Schr¨odinger-Coulomb propagator as given in Eq. (33). For the Pp4 and PL·S contributions,
many more terms appear in the calculation, and derivatives of the hypergeometric functions
with respect to parameters have to be evaluated. The result consists of terms involving
elementary functions and hypergeometric functions only, and other terms which involve
slightly more complex functions. Some of the summations give rise to the Lerch transcendent
Φ. Summations of the form

knξk ∂

∂b 2F1(−k, b, c, z).

∞

Xk=0

(52)

can be evaluated with the help of Eq. (36), for more details see [8]. Although we do not
describe the calculations in detail, we stress that the summation with respect to the k-index
is the decisive point in the calculation. In general, a sensible use of contiguous relations
is necessary to simplify the result of any of the summations. Symbolic procedures were
written to accomplish this. Through the compartmentalization of the calculation achieved
by the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, it has been possible to keep the average length of
intermediate expressions below 1000 terms.

The P -terms are integrated with respect to t by the following procedure. Terms which give
a divergence for ǫ → 0 are extracted from the integrand. The extraction can be achieved
by a suitable expansion in the argument of the hypergeometric function(s) which appear in
P (t). The extracted terms consist of elementary functions of t only, so they can be integrated
analytically. After integration, the terms are ﬁrst expanded in (Zα) up to (Zα)2, then in ǫ up
to ǫ0. The remaining part, which involves hypergeometric functions, is integrated numerically
with respect to t by the Gaussian method.

The t-integration leads to F -terms which we name according to the P -terms Fnd, Fnq,

Fδy, FδH , FδE and Fδφ. The Fnd-term, which is the same for both 2P -states, is given by

We have recovered the ﬁrst 9 digits of the Bethe logarithm with our (Gaussian) integration
procedure (the value for the Bethe logarithm given in [3] is ln k0(2P ) = −0.0300167089(3)).
The Fnd-term has, for ǫ → 0, a divergence of +2/9(Zα)2/ǫ, which cancels the corresponding
divergence in the high energy part. All other F -terms produce logarithmic divergences in
(Zα)2 ln(ǫ) (see Table I). The results for the low-energy parts of the 2P -states are

FL(2P1/2) = −

A60(2P3/2) = −0.50337(1).

(61)

The last digit is the cumulated inaccuracy of the numerical integrations. The values for the
A40 and A61 coeﬃcients are in agreement with known results [3].

11

These results can be compared to those obtained by P. Mohr [13] by extrapolation of his

numerical data for higher Z,

GSE(2) = −0.96(4), GSE(1) = −0.98(4)

for 2P1/2,

and

GSE(2) = −0.46(2), GSE(1) = −0.48(2)

for 2P3/2,

where the function GSE(Z) for 2P -states is deﬁned by

(62)

(63)

(64)

F = A40 + (Zα)2hA61 ln(cid:16)(Zα)−2(cid:17) + GSE(Z)i .

Because GSE(Z = 0) = A60, these values are clearly in very good agreement with the results
of our analytical calculation. Using P. Mohr’s numerical data [12], we have obtained the
following estimates for higher order terms summarized by GSE,7

F = A40 + (Zα)2hA60 + A61 ln(cid:16)(Zα)−2(cid:17) + (Zα) GSE,7(Z)i ,

GSE,7(2P1/2, Z = 1) = 3.1(5) and GSE,7(2P3/2, Z = 1) = 2.3(5).

(65)

(66)

One of the most important aspects of rather lengthy calculations such as those presented
here is to avoid errors. The result has been checked in many ways. Except for checking the
values of the terms divergent in ǫ, it was also checked the value of each P -contribution as
ω → 0. It can be shown easily that the sum of all contributions to the matrix element P
in the low-energy part must vanish in the limit ω → 0. Care must be taken when checking
the sum, because after the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, hidden terms are introduced
which do not contribute to the Lamb shift, but contribute in the limit ω → 0. The hidden
terms originate from the odd operators in Eq. (26). Taking into account these terms, the
sum vanishes for both states.

V. OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LAMB SHIFT

For the Lamb shift L, we use the implicit deﬁnition

E = mr [f (n, j) − 1] −

m2
r

2(m + mN )

[f (n, j) − 1]2 + L + Ehfs,

(67)

where E is the energy level of the two-body-system and f (n, j) is the dimensionless Dirac
energy, m is the electron mass, mr is the reduced mass of the system and mN is the nuclear
mass.

For the ﬁnal evaluation of the Lamb shift the following contributions are added:

1. One-loop self energy. The coeﬃcients are presented in this work. For the determination
of the Lamb shift the reduced mass dependence of the terms has to be restored.
The relevant formulae are given in [3]. For example, the A60 have a reduced mass
dependence of (mr/m)3. We use Eq. (66) to estimate the theoretical uncertainty from
the one–loop contribution.

12

2. Vacuum polarization correction. It enters for P -states in higher order (for the formulae

see [3], p. 570).

3. Two-loop contributions due to the anomalous magnetic moment [15]. It is given in

analogy to the one-loop contribution as

π(cid:19)2
δE2−loop = (cid:18)α

m

(Zα)4

n3

[B40 + . . .]

(68)

where the B-coeﬃcients are labeled in analogy to the A-coeﬃcients for the one-loop self
energy. The B40 coeﬃcient is due to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.
It is given as

B40 =

where Cjl = 2(j − l)/(j + 1/2).

B62 = " 4

n2

ln2(cid:16)(Zα)−2(cid:17)# (cid:18)mr

has been calculated in [14]. The B62 term, which is enlarged by the logarithm, probably
dominates the contributions to the two-loop self energy in higher order. So the result
may also be used to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of the two–loop contribution,
coming mainly from the unknown B61 coeﬃcient. It is taken to be half the contribution
from B62.

The formula for P-states has been ﬁrst calculated in [16]. This general form has been
obtained by us.

The above contributions are listed in table II for the 2P states.

VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The new theoretical values for the Lamb shifts of the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states are

and

L(2P1/2) = −12835.99(8) kHz

L(2P3/2) = 12517.46(8) kHz.

(76)

(77)

From the values of the 2P Lamb shifts, the ﬁne structure can be determined. It turns out
that the limiting factor in the uncertatinty is the experimental value of the ﬁne structure
constant α. Using a value of [17] (1987)

α−1 = 137.0359895(61)

(44 ppb),

the ﬁne structure can be determined as

E(2P3/2) − E(2P1/2) = 10969043(1) kHz.

With the most recent and most precise value of α available [18] (1995),

α−1 = 137.03599944(57)

(4.2 ppb),

we obtain a value of

E(2P3/2) − E(2P1/2) = 10969041.52(9)(8) kHz,

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

where the ﬁrst error originates from the uncertainty in α and the second from the uncertainty
in the Lamb shift diﬀerence. Our result for the ﬁne structure disagrees with that used by
Hagley and Pipkin in [19] for the determination of L(2S − 2P1/2). Therefore their result of
L(2S − 2P1/2) = 1057839(12) is to be modiﬁed and according to our calculation it should be

14

L(2S − 2P1/2) = 1057842(12) kHz.

(82)

Precise theoretical predictions for P -states could be used to compare two diﬀerent kind
of measurements of Lamb shifts in the hydrogen. One is the classic 2S1/2-2P1/2 Lamb shift
measured by several groups [20], [21], [19], and the second is the combined Lamb shift
L(4S − 2S) − 1
4 L(2S − 1S) as measured by the H¨ansch group (for a review see [22]). The
experimental value of 2S Lamb shift can be extracted from E(2S-2P1/2) having the precise
value for 2P1/2 Lamb shift, and can also be determined from the combined Lamb shift
through the formula

L(2S) =

8

7 "(cid:18)L(4S) −

5

4L(2S) + L(1S)(cid:19)exp −(cid:18)L(4S) −

17

8 L(2S) + L(1S)(cid:19)theo# ,

(83)

where the subscript exp denotes experimental, and the subscript theo denotes theoretical
values. This theo combination has the property that terms scaling 1/n3 cancel out, which
means that almost all QED eﬀects do not contribute, and therefore the quantity can be
precisely determined. Such a comparison of completely diﬀerent experimental techniques is
an interesting and valuable test of high precision experiments.

The method of calculation presented in this paper could be directly applied for the evalu-
ation of Lamb shifts and the ﬁne structure in two electron systems, for example in helium or
positronium. It was a purpose of this method to use only a Schr¨odinger-Coulomb propaga-
tor, and relativistic eﬀects are incorporated through the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.
This method clearly separates out the lower and the higher order terms, and expresses the
energy shift through the matrix elements of nonrelativistic operators.

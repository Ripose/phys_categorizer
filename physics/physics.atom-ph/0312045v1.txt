Abstract. – We investigate the electronic structure and properties of Rydberg atoms ex-
posed to a magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld. It is shown that the spatial as well as generalized time
reversal symmetries lead to a two-fold degeneracy of the electronic states in the presence of
the external ﬁeld. A delicate interplay between the Coulomb and magnetic interactions in the
inhomogeneous ﬁeld leads to an unusual weak ﬁeld splitting of the energy levels as well as
complex spatial patterns of the corresponding spin polarization density of individual Rydberg
states. Remarkably the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld induces a permanent electric dipole moment
of the atom.

The past two decades have seen substantial progress of our knowledge on highly excited
Rydberg atoms exposed to homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds providing major impact on areas
such as quantum chaos, semiclassics of nonintegrable systems and properties of magnetized
structures [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, so far there exist no investigations on Rydberg atoms in inho-
mogeneous and/or trapping magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Apart from being of fundamental
interest trapped Rydberg atoms have recently been proposed to serve as a tool for quantum
information processing in mesoscopic atomic ensembles [5]. For these applications the atoms
have to be localized in suﬃciently tight traps providing the appropriate conﬁnement of the
highly excited Rydberg states. Such a tight conﬁnement can be achieved for neutral atoms in
magnetic traps on atom chips [6] where large ﬁeld gradients
cm are accessible. As a
prototype example we study here the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld [7] that is a key element of
magnetic trapping (1). We show that Rydberg atoms conﬁned to a quadrupole ﬁeld possess
a speciﬁc structure and symmetry that lead to two-fold degeneracies of its eigenstates. The
Rydberg states exhibit unique phenomena such as complex spin polarization patterns and
magnetic ﬁeld-induced giant electric dipole moments that can be understood by employing
the underlying symmetries and analyzing the interplay between the Coulomb and magnetic

excited outermost electron takes place in the ﬁeld of a singly positive charged core. The accu-
racy of this assumption increases with increasing degree of excitation and holds particularly
well for the frequently used alkali atoms which possess a single valence electron outside a
closed shell core (2). We assume that the atomic center of mass (CM) is localized at the cen-
ter of the quadrupole ﬁeld requiring an ultracold CM motion of the atom. The Hamiltonian

to locally either upward or downward pointing spin and are arranged in a chess board-like
pattern. The borderlines between the islands correspond to a vanishing z-component of the
spin. The intersection of the borderlines i.e. the corners of the islands, represent the nodes of
the spatial probability densities of the Rydberg states as can be seen from the corresponding
graph WΛ in ﬁgure 2. With increasing value of r the shape of the islands become elongated in
radial direction and ﬁnally turn into directed stripes with continuous transitions of the spin
polarization. The formation of the islands is due to a detailed balance of the interactions
in the Hamiltonian
. This does not occur for the atom in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
(constant spin polarization) nor for the case of a pure spin in a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld
H2 only. The latter yields a spin polarization density that is independent of r
described by
showing horizontal stripes in the (r, θ)-representation of WS. These stripes can be found for
WS of the Rydberg states in ﬁgure 2 for large values of r in a modiﬁed form indicating the
dominance of the spin coupling to the magnetic ﬁeld in this regime. Analyzing the spin density
of many states we found that the above behaviour is generic. The spin polarization patterns
are features of individual electronic eigenstates and become increasingly more detailed with
increasing degree of excitation of the state considered. Transitions among eigenstates to the
total angular momentum Jz obey the selection rules ∆M = 0 and ∆M =
1 for dipole
transitions via linear and circular polarized light, as it is the case without the presence of the
polarized transitions between T OPz-eigenstates must involve states with

states belonging to the manifolds n

increases strongly with increasing degree of excitation n thereby showing a transition from
a regular alignment to an irregular spreading. In a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld the defor-
mation of the charge distribution is (due to parity symmetry) such that the electric dipole
moment vanishes. One possibility to probe the above-described properties of Rydberg atoms

in quadrupole magnetic ﬁelds would be to perform spectroscopy of single atoms in traps on,
preferably, atom chips since these possess currently the strongest available ﬁeld gradients.
This would provide us with detailed information on the level splitting and evolution with
increasing degree of excitation.

Already in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld it is well-known that the CM and
electronic motion of an atom do not decouple [10, 11, 12]. To enter the corresponding regime
where the residual coupling becomes important certain parameter values (excitation energy,
CM energy etc.) have to be addressed. A variety of intriguing phenomena due to the mixing
of the internal and CM motion such as the diﬀusion of the CM or giant dipole states are then
observed [13, 14, 15]. In the quadrupole ﬁeld the assumption that the atom is ultracold will
certainly minimize the CM motional eﬀects. Nevertheless, a residual coupling is unavoidable
and its impact on the electronic structure is, at this point, simply unkown: A full treatment of
the two-body system certainly goes beyond the scope of the present investigation and requires
both from the conceptual as well as computational point of view major investigations. On the
other hand one should note that the symmetries discussed here equally hold for the moving
two-body system i.e. the total angular momentum is conserved and the unitary as well as
antiunitary spin-spatial symmetries, now applied to both particles, are also present.

Beyond the above, one can speculate about potential applications of the magnetic ﬁeld-
induced permanent electric dipole moments of the atoms. Populating with a laser excited
states with a desired dipole moment for certain atoms within an array of single atom traps
can open the route to a controlled interaction between the atoms which is currently of major
interest for quantum information processing [16, 17, 5, 18]. Discussions with Oﬁr Alon and M.
Anderson are gratefully acknowledged. J.S. acknowledges ﬁnancial support by the European

In collisions at ultralow temperatures, molecules will pos-
sess Feshbach resonances, foreign to ultracold atoms, whose
virtual excited states consist of rotations of the molecules.
We estimate the mean spacing and mean widths of these res-
onant states, exploiting the fact the molecular collisions at
low energy display chaotic motion. As examples, we consider
the experimentally relevant molecules O2, OH, and PbO. The
density of s-wave resonant states for these species is quite
high, implying that a large number of narrow resonant states
will exist.

Scattering resonances are of great importance in ul-
tracold collisions. Feshbach resonances occur when the
energy of a pair of free atoms (or molecules) is nearly
degenerate with that of a quasi-bound state of the pair.
The quasi-bound state is characterized by the promotion
of one or both atoms to an excited internal state, for
example an excited hyperﬁne state [1]. External mag-
netic ﬁelds can then shift these states in or out of res-
onance, giving the experimenter direct control over in-
terparticle interactions [2].
In this way, Bose-Einstein
condensates of 85Rb have been made stable or unstable
on command, leading to novel many-body eﬀects [3]. It
is moreover predicted that this kind of control will be
useful in preparing degenerate Fermi gases in “resonant
superﬂuid” states with any desired interaction strength
[4,5]. Magnetic ﬁeld Feshbach resonances have now been
observed in the alkali atoms 23Na [6], 85Rb [7,8], 133Cs
[9], and 40K [10]. While not uncommon, these resonances
are far from ubiquitous in ultracold alkali atoms. This
is largely due to the relatively small number of hyperﬁne
states available to form resonances.

Ultracold molecules, by contrast, oﬀer a far greater
number of resonances than alkali atoms, because rota-
tional excitations can also contribute to resonant states.
In contrast to the two hyperﬁne states in an alkali atom,
a molecule can possess a large number of energetically
available rotational states. Considering that “typical” ro-
tational energy splittings are of order 1-10 K, while the
well depths of intermolecular potential energy surfaces
(PES’s) can be hundreds or thousands of K, it is clear
that tens of rotational states may contribute, including
their degeneracies arising from magnetic quantum num-
bers.

Identifying the number and properties of these reso-
nances is important for understanding the behavior of
a molecular gas reduced to extremely low temperatures.

These resonances may be useful as tools for pinning down
the details of multidimensional PES’s. They may also
imply resonant control over cold molecular collisions, in-
cluding, possibly, control over chemical reactions [11]. In
addition, the scattering dynamics is chaotic, implying
that ultracold resonances will form a new laboratory for
studying quantum chaos [12]. In this Letter we estimate
the most basic properties of these resonances, namely,
how many we can expect, and what their widths might
be. We are interested here in molecules produced in their
ro-vibrational ground states by buﬀer-gas cooling [13] or
Stark slowing [14] techniques. However, vibrationally ex-
cited cold molecules produced by photoassociation of cold
atoms will also exhibit rich resonant dynamics [15].

Classical chaos at low energies has been studied exten-
sively in molecular scattering problems [16]. Of greatest
relevance to our present purposes are multiple collision
events:
it is possible that a collision deposits suﬃcient
energy in internal molecular degrees of freedom (e.g., ro-
tations and vibrations) that there is not enough transla-
tional energy left to allow the molecules to separate. The
molecules may therefore collide many times before ﬁnally
shedding enough energy to separate. Multiple collisions
are increasingly likely as the collision energy is lowered,
and in fact are useful in quantifying the onset of chaos in
this regime [18].

rotor potential energy surface of Ref. [17]. At the collision
energies considered, vibrational excitation is not energet-
ically allowed. To simplify the calculation we constrain
all the coordinates to ﬁxed values except the intermolec-
ular distance R and the orientations of the molecules in
the scattering plane, as shown in the inset to Figure 1.
The main part of the ﬁgure shows a slice through a sam-
ple phase space trajectory for collision energy 1 mK. The
axes are R and the angular momentum Pθ1 (in units of
¯h) of one of the molecules. As a guide, the heavy solid
line indicates the allowed region of phase space. For the
molecules to separate at this energy, the greatest angular
momentum either molecule could have is 0.027¯h. Instead,
the molecules can exchange several ¯h of angular momen-
tum in each collision, and the trajectory eventually ﬁlls
the allowed phase space.

FIG. 2. Evidence of chaos in quantum mechanical scat-
tering of oxygen molecules.
(a) shows the complete elastic
scattering cross section, computed as in Ref. [19]. In (b) the
Dyson rigidity function (points) is computed for the energy
spacings of the 33 resonances in (a). Our results are much
more closely related to the results of a gaussian orthogonal
ensemble (GOE) approximation to a chaotic system than to
a nonchaotic regular system.

Chaotic motion in the classical realm leaves its signa-
ture in the quantum mechanical spectrum as well. We

2

have computed the quantum- mechanical elastic scatter-
ing cross section for the |N = 0, J = 1, MJ = 1i ﬁne-
structure state of 17O2 [Fig. 2(a)], following the model
described in Ref. [19]. As in Ref. [19], we have neglected
the nuclear spin of the 17O atoms, to emphasize the eﬀect
of from rotational motion. This model includes rotational
levels up to N = 2, and the partial waves L = 0, 2, ...14,
and ﬁnds 33 resonances in this energy range. Treating
these levels as bound states of the (O2)2 collision com-
plex, we expect to ﬁnd evidence of quantum chaos in
statistical measures of the energy level distributions. A
glance at the spectrum in Fig. 2a) suggests that there is
no clustering of levels, but rather that they are roughly
evenly spaced. This “rigidity” of level spacings is charac-
teristic of the quantum mechanical spectrum of a system
that displays classical chaos, and is usually quantiﬁed in
terms of the spectral rigidity function ∆(x) of Dyson and
Mehta [20]. If the number of states with energy less than
or equal to E is denoted N (E), then ∆(x) represents the
root-mean-squared deviation of N (E) from a straight line
over an energy range x, where x is measured in units of
the mean level spacing. Figure 2(b) shows this function,
computed using the resonances from Fig 2(a). A spec-
trum consisting of uncorrelated energy levels would yield
a rigidity ∆(x) = x/15, as shown with the dashed line. A
spectrum generated in the Gaussian orthogonal ensem-
ble (GOE) approximation, representing a chaotic system,
yields instead the solid line. The ∆(x) computed from
the spectrum in Fig. 2(a) more closely resembles the
GOE result, suggesting that this system is chaotic. A
similar analysis has been applied to the eigenphase shifts
in reactive scattering processes [21].

Given that the classical trajectories can ﬁll phase space
(Fig.1), each energetically allowed state is equally likely
to be populated during a resonant collision. This ob-
servation has been exploited in the theory of unimolec-
ular chemical reactions, which considers the breakup of
a large molecule under the inﬂuence of random collisions
with other molecules in a solution [22]. We use the same
idea here to estimate the total number of resonant states
available in a given energy range. To this end we sepa-
rate the molecule-molecule Hamiltonian into three inde-
pendent terms:

ˆH = ˆH1 + ˆH2 + ˆHint,

(1)

where ˆH1 and ˆH2 represent the rotational ﬁne structure
of each individual molecule, and ˆHint is an eﬀective in-
termolecular potential that depends only on R. Each
Hamiltonian is represented by a set of independent en-
ergy eigenvalues E1, E2, and Eint. During a resonant col-
lision any partition of the total energy E = E1 +E2 +Eint
is equally likely, provided that angular momentum is con-
served. Estimating the number of states N (E) at or be-
low energy E is then a simple counting exercise. The
density of states, ρ(E) = dN/dE, is also easily computed.
To illustrate that this is a reasonable estimate of the
density of states, we compare the results to those of a

s
D
fully quantum mechanical calculation for 17O2 - 17O2
scattering [19]. Table I tabulates, for the quantum me-
chanical calculation, the number of resonances in each
partial wave L in an energy range 1K above the incident
threshold. Each row in the table represents a separate
calculation, characterized by the maximum number of
molecular rotation states (Nmax) and partial wave states
(Lmax) included in the basis set.

Table II reports the same information, but this time
estimated from the statistical model. Statistical ﬂuctu-
ations in the density of states function ρ(E) in the rel-
evant energy range correspond to uncertainties of ∼ 50
% in the numbers given. Within this uncertainty the
agreement with the quantum mechanical calculation in
Table I is quite good, giving us further conﬁdence that
the statistical estimate is reasonable for this purpose.

A clear advantage of the statistical model over the full
calculation is that it can easily be extrapolated to include
all allowed values of N and L consistent with conserva-
tion of energy and angular momentum, as well as Bose
symmetry. The result is given by the ﬁnal row in Table
II, for small values of the incident partial wave. Consider-
ing all partial waves yields a total number of resonances
in this 1K interval of order ∼ 103. However, in ultra-
cold collisions we are limited to low values of L, typically
L = 0 alone, barring occasional shape resonances with
higher values of L. We therefore conclude from Table
II that the mean density of s-wave rotational resonances
in O2 is on the order of 10 K−1. For comparison, alkali
atoms typically exhibit on the order of 1 s-wave Feshbach
resonance per 1 K energy interval. Thus rotational Fesh-
bach resonances are slightly more numerous than atomic
hyperﬁne Feshbach resonances, but not strikingly so, at
least for nonpolar molecules. (In practice the numerous
hyperﬁne levels in 17O2 will play a role also, but we are
concerned here strictly with rotation.)

This simple statistical theory can also estimate the
widths of these resonances. Again borrowing from the
theory of unimolecular dissociation, the resonance width
may be approximated in the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-
Marcus (RRKM) approximation as [22]

¯Γ =

W (E+)
2π ¯ρ

,

(2)

where ¯ρ is the mean density of states we have been con-
sidering, and W (E+) is the number of states that per-
mit the molecules to actually escape to inﬁnite separa-
tion. For the low collision energies considered here, both
molecules must return to their ground state to separate,
so that W (E+) = 1. In the quantum mechanical calcu-
lation in Fig. 2(a), there are 33 resonances in a 1 Kelvin
interval, implying a mean width in this approximation
of ¯Γ ≈ 5 mK. For comparison, the arithmetic mean of
the quantum mechanical resonance widths is 8 mK. Note
that the quantum mechanical widths span several orders
of magnitude; their standard deviation is not given by
the RRKM result [23].

The situation is dramatically diﬀerent

for polar
molecules, whose long range dipole-dipole interaction po-
tential, proportional to 1/R3, holds many more inter-
molecular bound states near threshold. To illustrate this
point we consider two examples: OH, which is suitable
for Stark slowing [14]; and the a(1) state of PbO, which
is a leading candidate in which to measure the electric
dipole moment of the electron [25,26]. Both molecules
possess, in addition to a dipole moment, a pair of closely-
spaced states of opposite parity: a Λ doublet of split-
ting ∆ = 0.081 K in OH, and an Ω-doubling of splitting
∆ = 260 µK in PbO. Intermolecular potential curves cor-
relating to these thresholds will hold a large number of
dipole-bound resonant states. Details of the ﬁne struc-
ture of OH is given in [27], and that of PbO in [28].

For the OH-OH interaction an approximate PES ex-
ists [24]. We include the long-range part of this inter-
action, which has a minimum at R ≈ 6 a.u. that arises
from hydrogen bonding forces. For the sake of our sta-
tistical model, we approximate this surface with a sin-
gle curve by ﬁxing the two OH molecules in their lin-
ear geometry. The intermolecular bound state energies
Eint are then simply the bound states of this potential,
for each of the partial waves considered. We ignore for
our present purposes an even deeper part of the PES
corresponding to chemical binding of hydrogen peroxide,
H2O2. For PbO-PbO the PES is entirely unknown; how-
ever, since the bound states of interest depend primarily
on the long-range potential, we estimate the PbO-PbO
PES by multiplying that of OH-OH by the appropriate
ratio of squared dipole moments, [dPbO/dOH]2 ≈ 7.7. Ta-
ble III tabulates the number of s-wave resonances to be
expected for each species. These numbers refer to the
important energy range 2∆ above threshold, where the
number of resonances is greatest. Expressed as a mean
density-of-states over this range, the densities are 240
K−1 for OH and 2 × 105 K−1 for PbO, signiﬁcantly larger
than for the nonpolar O2.

In general, the resonances shift when an external elec-
tric ﬁeld is applied, so that one after the other can be
brought into resonance with the essentially zero-energy
molecules. Given a mean density of states ≈ 102 K−1
for OH, and given the OH dipole moment (=1.67 D), the
mean spacing of these resonances as a function of ﬁeld
would be of order ∼ 250 V/cm. This means that, in
contrast to the magnetic ﬁeld resonances in alkali atoms,
there will be many available resonances in ultracold polar
molecule collisions.

We conclude by sketching the implications of this work
for the theory of ultracold collisions. As is well-known,
ultracold collision theory requires a certain level of exper-
imental input to ﬁne-tune the scattering Hamiltonian.
It is not yet clear how much or what kind of informa-
tion is required to perform this ﬁne-tuning for molecules
[29]. Knowing roughly how many resonances to expect
can greatly simplify theory, by providing an estimate of
how many parameters are strictly necessary to reproduce
the data. With this information theory could then turn

3

around and predict how these resonances evolve with ap-
plied external electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

A second, equally important implication concerns ex-
periments at temperatures where kT is large compared
to the mean spacing between resonances. In this case in-
dividual resonances are not resolved, and only the overall
modulation of the spectrum matters. It is then likely that
semiclassical methods [30,31] should prove insightful.

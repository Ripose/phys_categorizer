The 4He3 bound states and the scattering of a 4He atom oﬀ a 4He dimer at ultra-low energies
are investigated using a hard-core version of the Faddeev diﬀerential equations. Various realistic
4He–4He interactions were employed, amomg them the LM2M2 potential by Aziz and Slaman and
the recent TTY potential by Tang, Toennies and Yiu. The ground state and the excited (Eﬁmov)
state obtained are compared with other results. The scattering lengths and the atom-diatom phase
shifts were calculated for center of mass energies up to 2.45 mK. It was found that the LM2M2 and
TTY potentials, although of quite diﬀerent structure, give practically the same bound-state and
scattering results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Small 4He clusters (in particular dimers and trimers) are of fundamental interest in various ﬁelds
of physical chemistry and molecular physics. Studies of these clusters represent an important step
towards understanding the properties of helium liquid drops, super-ﬂuidity in 4He ﬁlms, the Bose-
Einstein condensation etc. (see, for instance, Refs. [1–4]). Besides, the helium trimer is probably a
unique molecular system where a direct manifestation of the Eﬁmov eﬀect [5] can be observed since
the binding energy ǫd of the 4He dimer is extremely small.

The 4He trimer belongs to the three–body systems whose theoretical treatment is quite diﬃcult,
ﬁrst, due to its Eﬁmov nature and, second, because of the hard-core properties of the inter-atomic
He – He interaction [6–9]. At the same time the problem of three helium atoms can be considered as
an example of an ideal three–body quantum problem since 4He atoms are identical neutral bosons
and, thus, their handling is not complicated by spin, isospin, or Coulomb considerations.

There is a great number of experimental and theoretical studies of 4He clusters. However, most
of the theoretical investigations consist merely in computing the ground-state energy and are based
on variational methods [10–15], on Hyperspherical Harmonics expansion methods in conﬁguration
space [16,17], and on integral equations in momentum space [18,19]. We further note that the results
of Ref. [20] were based on a direct solution of the two-dimensional Faddeev diﬀerential equations
in conﬁguration space, while recent binding-energy results of [21] were obtained using the three-
dimensional Faddeev diﬀerential equations in the total-angular-momentum representation.

In Refs. [15,16,19,22] it was pointed out that the excited state of the 4He trimer is an Eﬁmov state
[5]. In these works the HFDHE2 [6], HFD-B [7], and LM2M2 [8] versions of the 4He–4He potentials
by Aziz and co-workers were employed. The essential property of this state is that it disappears
when the inter-atomic potential is increased by a factor λ
1.2. And vice versa, when λ slightly
decreases (no more than 2 %), a second excited state appears in the trimer [16,19]. It is just such

a non-standard behavior of the excited-state energies which points at their Eﬁmov nature. The
resonance mechanism of formation and disappearance of the Eﬁmov levels in the 4He trimer has
been studied in Refs. [23,24].

The general atom-diatom collision problem has been addressed by various authors, and we refer
the interested reader to the review articles [25] and [26]. The collision dynamics at thermal energies
of the H+H2 system and the existence of resonances were discussed in [27] using the Faddeev integral
equations in momentum space. Finally, the problem of existence of 4He n-mers and their relation to
the Bose-Einstein condensation in HeII was discussed in Refs. [28,29]. From the experimental studies
we mention those of Refs. [30–35] where molecular clusters, consisting of a small number of noble
gas atoms, were investigated.

In contrast to the bulk of theoretical investigations devoted to the binding energies of the 4He
trimer, scattering processes found comparatively little attention. In Ref. [18] the characteristics of
the He–He2 scattering at zero energy were studied, while the recombination rate of the reaction
(1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1) was estimated in [36]. Recently, the phase shifts of the He–He2 elastic scattering
and breakup amplitudes at ultra-low energies have also been calculated [22,37,38].

The diﬃculty in computing excited states and scattering observables in the 4He3 system is mainly
due to two reasons. First, the low energy ǫd of the dimer makes it necessary to consider very
large domains in conﬁguration space with a characteristic size of hundreds of ˚Angstroems. Second,
the strong repulsion of the He–He interaction at short distances produces large numerical errors.
In the present paper, which is an extension of our studies for 4He3 [22–24,37,38], we employed
the mathematically rigorous three-body Boundary Condition Model (BCM) of Refs. [39,40] to the
above-mentioned problems.

As compared to [22–24,37,38] we employ, in the present work, the reﬁned He–He interatomic
potentials LM2M2 by Aziz and Slaman [8], and TTY by Tang, Toennies and Yiu [9]. Our numerical
methods have been substantially improved, and this allowed us to use considerably larger grids
achieving, thus, a better accuracy. Furthermore, due to much better computing facilities more
partial waves could be taken into account.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we review the three-body bound and scattering state
formalism for hard-core interactions. In Sec. III we describe its application to the system of three
4He atoms and present our numerical results. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. IV. Finally
in the Appendix we give details of the potentials used.

II. FORMALISM

A detailed analysis of the general boundary-value problem, the derivation of the asymptotic bound-
ary conditions for scattering states and other boundary-value formulations, can be found in Refs.
[41,42]. In this work we employ a hard-core version of the BCM [40,43] developed in [39,44] (for
details see Ref. [22]). Therefore, in what follows we shall only outline the formalism and present its
main characteristics.

In describing the three-body system we use the standard Jacobi coordinates xα, yα, α = 1, 2, 3,

expressed in terms of the position vectors of the particles ri and their masses mi,

where (α, β, γ) stands for a cyclic permutation of the indices (1, 2, 3).

In the so-called hard-core potential model one requires that the wave function vanishes when
the particles approach each other at a certain distance r = c. This requirement is equivalent to
the introduction of an inﬁnitely strong repulsion between the particles at distances r
c. Such a
replacement of the repulsive short-range part of the potential by a hard-core interaction turns out
to be a very eﬃcient way to suppress inaccuracies at short distances. One can then show that the
Faddeev components satisfy the following system of diﬀerential equations

which requires the sum of Φα(X) to be zero only at the radius cα.

The numerical advantage of our approach is already obvious from the structure of Eqs. (1). When
a potential with a strong repulsive core is replaced by the hard-core model, one approximates inside
the core domains only the Laplacian ∆X instead of the sum of the Laplacian and the huge repulsive
term. In this way a much better numerical approximation can be achieved.

In the present investigation we apply the formalism to the 4He three-atomic system with total
angular momentum L = 0. The partial-wave version of the equations (1) for a system of three
identical bosons with L = 0 reads [45,46]

III. RESULTS

We employed the Faddeev equations (3) and the hard-core boundary condition (6) to calculate
the binding energies of the helium trimer and the ultra-low energy phase shifts of the helium atom
scattered oﬀ the helium diatomic molecule. As He-He interaction we used three versions of the
semi-empirical potentials of Aziz and collaborators, namely HFDHE2 [6], HFD-B [7], and the newer
version LM2M2 [8]. Further, we employed the latest theoretical He–He potential TTY of Tang
et al. [9]. These potentials are given in the Appendix.
In our calculations we used the value
~2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2. All the potentials considered produce a weakly bound dimer state. The energy
ǫd of this state together with the He–He atomic scattering length ℓ(2)
It is
interesting to note that the latest potentials LM2M2 and TTY give practically the same scattering
length ℓsc and dimer energy ǫd.

sc are given in Table I.

A detailed description of our numerical method has been given in Ref. [22]. Therefore, we outline
here only the main steps of the computational scheme employed to solve the boundary-value problems
(3), (5), (6) and (7) or (8). First, we note that the grid for the ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation of
the polar coordinates ρ and θ is chosen such that the points of intersection of the arcs ρ = ρi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , Nρ and the rays θ = θj, j = 1, 2, . . . , Nθ with the core boundary x = c constitute
the knots. The value of c was ﬁxed to be such that any further decrease of it did not appreciably
inﬂuence the dimer binding energy ǫd and the energy of the trimer ground state E(0)
. In our previous
work [22,37,38] c was chosen as 0.7 ˚A. In the present work, however, we choose c = 1.0 ˚A. This value
of c provides a dimer bound state ǫd which is stable within six ﬁgures and a trimer ground-state
energy E(0)

stable within three ﬁgures. The ρi are chosen according to the formulas

Since we consider identical bosons only the components Φl corresponding to even l diﬀer from
zero. Thus, the number of equations to be solved is Ne = lmax/2 + 1 where lmax is the maximal even
partial wave. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation of the Ne equations (3) reduces the problem to a
system of NeNθNρ linear algebraic equations. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations corresponding to the
arc i = Nρ include initially the values of the unknown functions Φl(x, y; z) from the arc i = Nρ + 1.
To eliminate them, we express these values through the values of Φl(x, y; z) on the arcs i = Nρ and
i = Nρ −
1 by using the asymptotic formulas (7) or (8) in the manner described in the ﬁnal part
of Appendix A of Ref. [22]. In [22], however, this approach was used for computing the binding
energies only while in the present work this method is extended also to the scattering problem. The
matrix of the resulting system of equations has a block three-diagonal form. Every block has the
NeNθ and consists of the coeﬃcients standing at unknown values of the Faddeev
dimension NeNθ ×
components in the grid knots belonging to a certain arc ρ = ρi. The main diagonal of the matrix
consists of Nρ such blocks.

In this work we solve the block three-diagonal algebraic system on the basis of the matrix sweep
method [47]. The use of this method makes it possible to avoid writing the matrix on the hard drive
of the computer. Besides, the matrix sweep method reduces the computer time required by almost
one order of magnitude as compared to [22,37,38].

Our results for the trimer ground-state energy E(0)

as well as the results obtained by other authors
t
are presented in Table II. It should be noted that most of the contribution to the ground-state energy
stems from the l = 0 and l = 2 partial components, the latter being slightly more than 30 %, and is
approximately the same for all potentials used. The contribution from the l = 4 partial wave is of
the order of 3-4 % (cf. [20]).

It is well known that the excited state of the 4He trimer is an Eﬁmov state [16,19,22–24]. The
results obtained for this trimer excited-state energy E(1)
, as well as the results found in the literature,
are presented in Table III. To illustrate the convergence of our results we show in Table IV the
dependence of the energy E(1)
on the grid parameters using the TTY potential. It is seen that the
l = 0 partial component contributes about 71 % to the excited-state binding energy. The contribution
to E(1)
from the l = 2 component is about 25–26 % and from l = 4 within 3–4 %. These values are
t
similar to the ones for the ground state.

Apart from the binding energy calculations, we also performed calculations for a helium atom
scattered oﬀ a helium dimer for L = 0. For this we used the asymptotic boundary conditions (8).
The results of the scattering length of the collision of the He atom on the He dimer obtained for the
HFD-B, LM2M2 and TTY potentials are presented in Table V. As compared to [22] the present
5 ˚A for HFD-B with lmax = 2 was obtained
calcualtion is essentially improved (the result ℓsc = 145
in [22] with a much smaller grid). Within the accuracy of our calculations, the scattering lengths
provided by the LM2M2 and TTY potentials, like the energies of the excited state, are exactly the

same. This comes as no surprise as the two potentials produce practically the same two-body binding
energies and scattering lengths.

The phase shifts results obtained for the HFD-B, LM2M2 and TTY potentials are given in Tables
VI, VII, and VIII. For the HFD-B and TTY potentials they are plotted in Fig. 1. Note that for the
phase shifts we use the normalization required by the Levinson theorem [48], δL(0)

corresponding inverse wave numbers κ−1 for the trimer excited-state energies. The values of κ,

and ǫd are given in ˚A−2, are also presented in Table
V. It is seen that the values of κ are about 1.3–1.7 times smaller than the respective 4He-atom
4He-dimer scattering lengths. The situation diﬀers completely from the 4He two-atomic scattering
problem where the inverse wave numbers (κ(2))−1 =
−1/2 are in a rather good agreement with
the 4He–4He scattering lengths (see Table I). Such signiﬁcant diﬀerences between ℓsc and κ−1 in the
case of the 4He three-atomic system can be attributed to the Eﬁmov nature of the excited state of
the trimer which implies that the eﬀective range r0 for the interaction between the 4He atom and
the 4He dimer is very large as compared to the 4He diatomic problem.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we employed a formalism which is suitable for three–body calculations with hard–core
potentials. The approach is a hard-core variant of the BCM and, unlike some competing methods,
is exact and ideally suited for three-body calculations with two–body interactions with a highly
repulsive core. Furthermore, the method is feasible not only for bound–states but also for scattering
processes. There is, however, a price to be paied for the exact treatment of the system. The inclusion
of higher partial waves, beyond lmax = 4, is hard to be implemented within the computing facilities
we have at our disposal.

The results of the ground-state energy of the 4He trimer obtained for all four realistic 4He–4He
potentials compare favorably with alternative results in the literature. Furthermore, the successful
location of the excited state, interpreted as an Eﬁmov state, clearly demonstrates the reliability of
our method in three-body bound state calculations with hard-core potentials. In addition to binding
energy calculations, the formalism has been successfully used to calculate scattering lengths and
ultra-low-energy phase shifts of the 4He atom scattered oﬀ the 4He dimer.

In general the hard-core inter-atomic potential together with other characteristics of the system,
makes calculations extremely tedious and numerically unstable. This is not the case in our formalism
where the hard core is taken into account from the very beginning in a mathematically rigorous way.
Thus, the formalism paves the way to study various ultra–cold three-atomic systems, and to calculate
important quantities such as the cross-sections, recombination rates, etc.

converting the length units we used the factor 1 a.u.= 0.52917 ˚A.) The function Vex has the form

V (x) = A [Vex(x) + Vdisp(x)]

with p =

1 , while the function Vdisp reads

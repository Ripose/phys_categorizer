Coherent time evolution of highly excited Rydberg states
in Rb (98 ≤ n ≤ 150) under pulsed electric ﬁeld in high slew-
rate regime was investigated with the ﬁeld ionization detec-
tion. The electric ﬁeld necessary to ionize the Rydberg states
was found to take discrete values successively depending on
the slew rate. Speciﬁcally the slew-rate dependence of the
ionization ﬁeld varies with the quantum defect value of the
states, i.e. with the energy position of the states relative to
the adjacent manifold. This discrete transitional behavior of
the ionization ﬁeld observed for the ﬁrst time is considered to
be a manifestation of the strong coherence eﬀect in the time
evolution of the Rydberg states in pulsed electric ﬁeld and
opens a new eﬀective way to stringently select a low-ℓ state
from the nearby states by ﬁeld ionization.

Highly excited Rydberg states [1] in the ramped elec-
tric ﬁeld is one of the most interesting systems which
provide ideal and versatile situations for investigating the
coherence eﬀects in the time evolution of a quantum sys-
tem with many potential-energy curves crossing one an-
other [2]. In spite of this interesting feature and also of
the potential applicability to the wide area of fundamen-
tal physics including cavity QED and quantum compu-
tation [3], the Rydberg states with high principal quan-
tum number n >
∼ 80 have not been investigated in detail,
partly because of the diﬃculty in selectively detecting
a particular state from many close-lying states; in such
highly excited states, the ﬁeld ionization process gener-
ally occurs both through the non-adiabatic and adiabatic
transitions, resulting multiple ionization thresholds and
the selective detection of a particular state becomes in-
creasingly more diﬃcult.

The purpose of this Letter is to present the experimen-
tal results on the ﬁeld ionization of the Rydberg states
with n = 98 − 150.
It was observed for the ﬁrst time
that in high slew rate regime in the applied pulsed elec-
tric ﬁeld, the ﬁeld ionization process has single threshold
value: Speciﬁcally the ionization electric ﬁeld takes dis-
crete values successively with increasing slew rate, and
this dependence varies with the position of the states rel-
ative to the adjacent manifold. This transitional behavior
in the ﬁeld ionization shows regular dependence on the
principal quantum number n, thus indicating that this
behavior is quite general and applicable to a wide range
of higher-lying Rydberg states. Since the diﬀerences in

1

the ﬁeld ionization values were found to be large enough,
i.e. 300 % for the 111p3/2 and 111s1/2 states, it is possi-
ble to stringently select a low-ℓ state from the close-lying
states by ﬁeld ionization. From these characteristic be-
haviors, it is strongly suggested that the coherence in
the time evolution under the pulsed electric ﬁeld plays
decisive role to the behavior of the ﬁeld ionization.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. Thermal
Rb atoms in the ground-state atomic beam are passed
through a laser excitation region and then the ﬁeld ion-
ization region, which are about 40 mm apart each other.
The whole volume of the excitation and the ﬁeld ion-
ization regions is surrounded with three pairs of planer
copper electrodes to compensate the stray ﬁeld in three
axes and also to apply the pulsed electric ﬁeld for the
ionization. The selective ﬁeld ionization (sﬁ) electrodes
consist of two parallel plates of 120 mm length, in one of
which a ﬁne copper-mesh grid was incorporated into the
area of 20 × 20 mm2, thus allowing to pass and detect the
ﬁeld ionized electrons with a channel electron multiplier.
The sﬁ electrodes and the laser interaction region were
attached to a cold ﬁnger in a cryostat, thus the tempera-
ture can be varied from room temperature down to lower
temperature with liquid N2 and He.

Two-step cw-laser excitation was adopted to excite the
Rydberg nj states from the 5s1/2 ground state of 85Rb
through the 5p3/2 second excited state. A diode laser
(780 nm for the ﬁrst step) and a dye laser of coumarin
102 excited by a Kr ion-laser (479 nm for the second step)
were used. The main reason to use the cw lasers to ex-
cite the Rydberg states instead of the usually adopted
pulsed lasers is that we want to use this ﬁeld ionization
scheme for the selective ionization of highly excited Ry-
dberg states in a continuous mode as discussed later.

The pulse shape applied for the ﬁeld ionization is
shown also in Fig. 1. The pulse sequence was produced
with a waveform generator NI5411 and the ﬁeld ioniza-
tion signals were detected and analyzed with the Lab-
VIEW data acquisition system on a pc computer. Rep-
etition rate of the pulse was kept to 5 kHz so that the
detection eﬃciency of the Rydberg states is optimum for
the atoms with velocity of 350 m/s [4]. The ionization
mainly occurs at the steep rise of the pulse during the
time tf , but the peak ﬁeld can be kept for a time th
(holding time) to ionize also the states with longer life
time than tf under the electric ﬁeld. This point will be
discussed later.

FIG. 1. Experimental setup for investigating the time evo-
lution and the ﬁeld ionization process under the pulsed elec-
tric ﬁeld in high slew rate regime. Also shown is the pulse
shape of the applied electric ﬁeld.

During the course of the present experiment, stray ﬁeld
of ∼ 80 mV/cm was found to appear in the interaction
region. By applying suitable compensation potentials in
three axes, the stray ﬁeld was reduced to less than 10
mV/cm. In this stray ﬁeld, the p state with n less than
120 is well separated from the adjacent manifold levels.
The eﬀect of the mixing of the low-ℓ states to the neigh-
boring levels on the ﬁeld ionization behavior is discussed
later.

In Fig. 2 shown are ﬁeld ionization spectra of 111s1/2
and 111p3/2 states [5] as a function of the applied electric
ﬁeld F = vf /l (l is the distance of the sﬁ electrode),
which were measured by varying the slew rate S = F/tf .
Here the slow component of the pulsed ﬁeld vs was set
to zero.

In these spectra, only one prominent peak was found as
the threshold electric ﬁeld. Remarkably the sﬁ ﬁeld value
at the peak changes to a smaller value with increasing
slew rate at a particular slew rate. Moreover the sﬁ ﬁelds
for the s and p states are quite diﬀerent from each other
at the same slew rate. For example, the electric ﬁeld
necessary to ionize the 111p3/2 state at the slew rate of
11 V/(cm·µs) is 1.7 V/cm, while the value is 5.2 V/cm
for the 111s1/2 state, more than 300 % diﬀerence (see the
spectrum d in Fig.2).

It should also be noted here that the transitional be-
havior in the 109d state (not shown in Fig. 2 to avoid
complexity) is the same as in the s1/2 state. This means
that the transitional behavior depends on the position of
the states relative to the adjacent manifold: As seen from
the relevant Stark energy-ﬁeld diagramin in Fig. 3, the
upper − positioned [6] p state shows diﬀerent transitional
behavior from the lower − positioned s and d states.

In Fig.4 shown is the eﬀective principal-quantum-
number n∗ dependence of the critical slew rate Sc and the
ionization electric ﬁelds Fc for the s and p states. Here

the critical slew rate Sc is deﬁned as the value at which
the transition of the sﬁ ﬁeld just starts to a new value.
Also the sﬁ ﬁeld corresponds to the peak position of the
ionization signal. These values vary quite regularly with
n∗ ranging from 95 to 147; approximately Fc ∝ (n∗)−4.0
for both the p and s states, while Sc ∝ (n∗)−4.0 for the
p state and Sc ∝ (n∗)−2.8 for the s state.

These results indicate that this transitional behavior
is quite general for a wide range of n and thus can be
applicable to selectively ionize the s and p states for a
wide range of higher excited states. The diﬀerence in
the ionization ﬁeld is ∼ 300 % for the s and p states,
quite large compared to the case of adiabatic transition
in which the diﬀerence would be only 5 % for the states
at n ∼ 110.

FIG. 2. Typical ﬁeld ionization spectra for the 111s1/2 and
111p3/2 states measured by varying the slew rate, values of
which are shown at the right side of each spectra. The spectra
for the repspective states (s and p) taken separately were su-
perposed upon each other in these spectra. Solid and dashed
lines are the ﬁtted results with a Gaussian plus linear back-
ground.

Related to the selectivity in the Rydberg states,

it
should be noted that there observed some sﬁ signals at
the lower ﬁeld region (1.0 ∼ 2.4 V/cm) in the sﬁ spec-
trum of s state: The signal peak at this portion changed
discretely with slew rate as in the same manner as of
the p state. This part of signal counts is due to the ef-
fect of blackbody radiations which induce the transition
from the initial s state to the p state. In fact the counts
at this portion measured by varying the temperature of
the excitation-detection region from 120 K to 40 K was
found to depend linearly on the temperature as expected.
The observed transition rate to the p state is in roughly
agreement in its absolute values and in good agreement in
its temperature dependence with the theoretical predic-
tions. This agreement indicates also that the selectivity
of the excited states with the ﬁeld ionization method in
the pulsed electric ﬁeld regime is quite good even at such

2

highly excited region. The detailed discussion on the s to
p transitions and the eﬀect of blackbody radiations will
be reported elsewhere.

The above results were all obtained without the slow
component vs of the pulsed ﬁeld. Switching on this value,
the transitional behavior of the s state remains the same,
while that of the p state changes drastically as in the fol-
lowing: When the applied slow component ﬁeld with its
slew rate less than 1 mV/(cm·µs) exceeds the ﬁrst anti-
crossing ﬁeld (∼ 75 mV/cm for the 111p3/2 state, see
Fig. 3), the transitional behavior changes abruptly, be-
coming the same as of the s state. This means that once
the ﬁrst anti-crossing is traversed adiabatically and the
state is mixed with the adjacent manifold levels, then the
following sﬁ behavior for the p state under the high slew
rate regime changes completely, resulting no diﬀerence in
their behavior between the states of opposite positions to
the adjacent manifold.

These experimental results, especially the transitional
behavior, are in general not in agreement with simple
predictions from the incoherent contributions of adia-
batic and non-adiabatic transition processes: The exper-
imental sﬁ spectra have only one prominent peak and
this peak ﬁeld does neither correspond exactly to the ex-
pected position from the purely adiabatic (paths 2 or 3
in Fig. 3), nor diabatic transitions (paths 1 or 4) lead-
ing to the reddest or bluest trajectory in the adjacent
manifold; the expected ﬁelds for these paths (1 to 4)
in n = 108 (corresponding to the adjacent manifold of
111s and 111p states from the quantum defect values in
Rb) are 1.8, 2.4, 2.4, and 4.2 V/cm respectively, which
should be compared to the observed ﬁeld values of 1.7
and 5.2 V/cm for the p and s states, respectively. More
importantly, these spectra show very clear slew rate de-
pendence as described above which can not be explained
from a simple incoherent process.

FIG. 3. Stark energy diagram near the 108 manifold in
Rb together with the classical ﬁeld-ionization threshold-line

(E = −6.12√F ), where all the avoided crossings are not ex-

plicitely shown for simplicity. The arrows 1 to 4 indicate the
possible trajectories for the adiabatic (2 and 3) and the ex-
treme non-adiabatic (1 and 4) transitions.

Recently Harmin [2] examined coherent time evolu-
tion on a grid of Landau-Zener anti-crossing under a
linear ramped electric ﬁeld in which each manifold lev-

3

els are treated as linear in time, parallel, and equally
spaced and inﬁnite number. The time development of
an initially populated state is then governed by two level
Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions at avoided crossings and
adiabatic evolution between them. The key parameters
in this model study are 1)the LZ transition probabilities
D for making a non-adiabatic transition process at the
anti-crossing traversals and 2) the dynamical phase unit
ϕ. The phase unit ϕ is the area covered by the pair of the
adjacent up- and down-going levels [2]. The overall dif-
ference in phase advance ∆Φ for two paths from zero to
the ionization ﬁeld is equal to the sum of the phase units
ϕ in the whole area covered by the two paths.
In the
actual Stark energy-ﬁeld grid system, the phase units ϕi
are not a constant but vary with respective anti-crossings.
These parameters D and ϕ are estimated approximately
by D = [exp(−π ˜µ2ϕ)]2, ϕ ∼ (3 ˙F n10)−1, where ˜µ is an
average low-ℓ quantum defect and ˙F is the slew rate of
the applied electric ﬁeld F .

The probability D increases monotonically with in-
creasing slew rate, while the overall diﬀerence in phase
advance ∆Φ of the state wave function through the grid is
eﬀective in modulo 2π and strongly aﬀects the coherent
nature of the process through the interference between
many states populated along the way of traversals in the
applied electric ﬁeld [2].

In the present experimental setup with slew rate ∼ 20
V/(cm·µs) at n ∼ 100, the probability of non-adiabatic
transition D is quite high, reaching ∼ 99.8% from the
above estimation so that our case corresponds to the non-
adiabatic limit in Harmin’s treatment in a good approx-
imation.

Taking into account the quantum defect values of

ℓ states from the many close-lying states, thus opening
a new way to apply the highly excited Rydberg states
to fundamental physics research. One of the example
of such applications is to search for dark matter axions
with a Rydberg-atom cavity detector [7]. In this kind of
search experiment, it is essential to do the experiment in
a continuous way so as to keep the detection eﬃciency as
high as possible. It is thus inevitable to use cw lasers to
excite the Rydberg atoms continuously which is the main
reason for developing the present experimental setup.

continuous encouragement throughout this work. This

cially Promoted Research (No.09102010) by the Ministry

low ℓ states, estimated phase unit ϕ varies from 10−2
to 10−3 with increasing electric ﬁeld. The number of
avoided crossings traversed between zero ﬁeld and the
ﬁeld ionization region in Rb is estimated to be Nblue ∼
900 (cid:0) n
for the up- (bluest) and
down- (reddest) going trajectories, respectively. At the
region of n ∼ 110, this number of anti-crossing traver-
sals suggests that the phase advance is over 2π at some
ﬁeld value. When this resonance condition is fulﬁlled,
the constructive interference between the many number
of Stark states along the advance of the pulsed electric
ﬁeld may result in one prominent peak in the sﬁ ﬁeld. In
Harmin’s analysis [2], the population of the states under
the electric ﬁeld was found to make a series of resonances
in a form of lanes along the up- or down-going directions
of the initially excited state at zero ﬁeld.

This general feature in the non-adiabatic limit seems
to be satisﬁed experimentally, since a discrete sequence
of sﬁ threshold ﬁeld was found, depending on the slew
rate. However there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the ex-
perimental observations compared to the model calcula-
tion in that the observed sﬁ ﬁeld values for both of the s
and p states decrease with increasing slew rate. Contrary
to this observation, the model calculation predicts that
with increasing slew rate, the most populated state ap-
proaches to the limiting trajectory in the manifold, i.e.
to the bluest state for the up-going initial state or the
reddest state for the down-going initial state, depending
on the direction (up- or down-going) of the initial state.
This suggests thus that the sﬁ threshold ﬁeld for the s
and d states in Rb should increase with increasing slew
rate, in disagreement with the experimental results.

Finally we note that the sﬁ spectra observed with the
holding time th extended up to 500 µs showed no dis-
tinguishable diﬀerence from those taken with the short
holding time of 1µs, indicating all the states ionized have
decay lifetime shorter than 1 µs in the electric ﬁeld. Also
we observed no signiﬁcant sﬁ-signals over 10 V/cm in
the spectra measured. The decay rate of the blue states
in the electric ﬁeld by the tunneling process, estimated
from the hydrogenic approximation, is much higher than
2×103 s−1. Therefore the ionization process for the states
along the blue lines is not due to the tunneling pro-
cess but of autoionization-like one due to their mixing
to the red continuum, even though such coupling becom-
ing weaker as n increases [1].

In conclusion, we observed for the ﬁrst time a dis-
crete transition of the threshold sﬁ ﬁeld with slew rate in
the highly excited Rydberg states in Rb, the behavior of
which depends also on the position of the low ℓ states rel-
ative to the adjacent manifold. The experimental results
strongly suggest that the coherent interference eﬀect in
the time evolution on the grid of anti-crossings under the
pulsed electric ﬁeld plays decisive role for the occurrence
of such transitional behavior.

The transitional behavior observed here brings us a
new powerful method to selectively ﬁeld-ionize the low

Conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculations in atoms with two valence electrons, carried out in the
V (N−2) Hartree-Fock potential of the core, are corrected for core-valence interactions using many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT). Two variants of the mixed CI+MBPT theory are described and
applied to obtain energy levels and transition amplitudes for Be, Mg, Ca, and Sr.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Although Be, Mg, Ca, and Sr atoms have been studied
theoretically for many years and numerous calculations
are available in the literature, energy levels of those di-
valent atoms have been treated primarily with semiem-
pirical methods and only a limited number of low-lying
levels have been evaluated using ab-initio methods, which
often do not provide suﬃcient precision or require exten-
sive computer resources. Semiempirical methods, to their
advantage, do not require signiﬁcant computer resources
and can be applied easily to a large number of levels;
however, such theories have limited predictive power and
accuracy. Although energies obtained using semiempiri-
cal methods agree well with one another and with exper-
iment, oscillator strengths obtained by diﬀerent semiem-
pirical calculations are inconsistent [1]. Examples of
semiempirical calculations can be found for Be in [1], for
Ca in [2], and for Sr in [3]. Large-scale ab-initio con-
ﬁguration interaction (CI) calculations of energies and
transition rates, although capable of high accuracy, have
been performed only for a few low-lying levels in the Be
[4, 5] and Mg [6] isoelectronic sequences. The size of the
conﬁguration space in such CI calculations is limited by
the available computer resources. Smaller-scale CI cal-
culations, carried out in the frozen V (N−2) Hartree-Fock
potential of the core, lead to poor results. We found, for
example, that frozen-core CI calculations in Ca gave en-
ergies so inaccurate that it was diﬃcult, if at all possible,
to identify many closely spaced levels of experimental
interest. Multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) and
Hartree-Fock (MCHF) methods have also been used to
obtain energies and oscillator strengths in divalent atoms:
MCHF for Be-like ions [7] and neutral calcium [8], and
MCDF for Mg-like ions [9]. The accuracy of MCHF and
MCDF calculations in neutral atoms is poor, basically
because of computational limits on the number of con-

ﬁgurations. Polarization potentials have been used in
conjunction with MCHF calculations [10] to improve the
accuracy of energies for Ca I and Ca II. Many-body per-
turbation theory (MBPT) calculations of energies and
oscillator strengths for neutral divalent atoms using an ef-
fective Hamiltonian within a small model space, are also
found to be inaccurate [11, 12]. Good agreement with
experiment for divalent atoms, however, was achieved in
Refs. [13, 14, 15] with a combined CI+MBPT method.
A related method was applied to calculations of ener-
gies and oscillator strengths for Mg-like ions in Ref. [16].
Among the ab-initio methods, CI+MBPT is particularly
attractive since it is capable of giving accurate energies
and transition rates for both light and heavy divalent
atoms with modest computer resources.

A precise and eﬃcient theoretical method for cal-
culations of properties of divalent atoms is needed
in-
for many possible applications of current interest,
cluding calculations of spectra, transition amplitudes,
hyperﬁne structure constants, polarizabilities, parity-
nonconserving (PNC) amplitudes, van der Waals coef-
ﬁcients, and Lennard-Jones coeﬃcients. There is also
growing interest in properties of divalent atoms in con-
junction with low-temperature Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion (BEC) experiments. For example, the prospect for
achieving BEC in divalent atoms was discussed in [17, 18]
and depends on the size of the van der Waals coeﬃcient.

At least two major diﬃculties have been recognized in
studying divalent atoms. First, core polarization eﬀects
are signiﬁcant and must be taken into account. A sim-
ilar situation exists in monovalent atoms where various
methods have been successfully applied to describe the
valence-core interaction. We have made extensive use of
one of these methods, MBPT, and have developed meth-
ods for calculating all diagrams up to the third order
for energies [19] and transition amplitudes [20]. A sec-
ond major diﬃculty is that two valence electrons interact
so strongly in neutral atoms that two-particle diagrams
must be included to inﬁnite order. Since inﬁnite order is
required, the MBPT method is diﬃcult to apply. How-
ever, valence-valence correlations can be accounted for
completely using the CI method.

With this in mind, we have developed a method (sim-

ilar to that used in Refs. [13, 14, 15] but with important
diﬀerences) for high-precision calculations of properties
of atoms with two valence electrons. The method starts
with a complete CI calculation of the interactions be-
tween the valence electrons in a frozen core and accounts
for valence-core interactions using MBPT. We apply this
combined CI+MBPT method to calculate energy levels
and transition amplitudes for Be, Mg, Ca, and Sr.

B. Combining CI with MBPT

Core polarization eﬀects can be treated using MBPT.
In this paper, we introduce two procedures that enable us
to combine frozen-core CI and second-order two-valence-
electron MBPT, which we refer to as “CI averaging” and
“Brueckner-Orbital CI” methods.

II. METHOD

A. Frozen-Core CI

We start with a lowest-order description of a divalent
atom in which the closed N-2 electron core is described
in the HF approximation and valence or excited elec-
trons satisfy HF equations in the “frozen” V (N−2) HF
core. As we mentioned in the introduction, the strong
valence-valence correlations must be included to inﬁnite
order; the CI method accomplishes this. The conﬁgura-
tion space for divalent atoms is built up in terms of the
excited HF orbitals. We include all orbitals with angular
momentum l
5 (partial wave contributions scale as
1/(l + 1/2)4) and we use 25 basis functions out of a com-
plete set of 40 for each value of angular momentum. The
eﬀect of these restrictions is insigniﬁcant considering the
perturbative treatment of valence-core correlations.

≤

A detailed discussion of the CI method (as used here)
can be found in Ref. [21]. We introduce a conﬁguration-
ΦJM (ij) in which single-
state wave function ΦI ≡
particle basis orbitals i and j are combined to give a
two-particle wave function with angular momentum J
and deﬁnite parity. We then expand the general two-
particle wave function ΨJM in terms of all ΦJM (ij) in
our basis set

the solution of the CI equation, Eq. (3), and H (2) is that
part of the eﬀective Hamiltonian projected onto the va-
lence electron subspace containing second-order valence-
core interactions. The dominant second-order parts of
the eﬀective Hamiltonian, beyond those accounted for in
the CI calculation, are the screening and self-energy dia-
grams: H (2) = H screen+H self , the self-energy being much
larger than the screening and both being larger than the
remaining second-order terms.

We borrow ready-to-use formulas, derived using stan-
dard techniques, from Ref. [12]. The screening contribu-

In the above equations, J is the angular momentum of
the coupled two-particle states. The coupled radial inte-
grals Xk(abcd) and Zk(abcd) are deﬁned in [12]. We use

the notation [k] = 2k + 1. The quantities ηvw are nor-
malization constants, ηvw = 1/√2 for identical particle
states and 1, otherwise. In the expression for the self-
energy, the angular momenta of the ith and jth orbitals
satisfy κi = κj, where κi =

(9)

In heavy atoms, the choice of ǫ0 deserves special consid-
eration. Problems with denominators arise from the fact
that single-particle orbitals used in the self-energy cal-
culation are not optimal, in the sense that there is mu-
tual interaction between valence electrons not accounted
for, even approximately, in the V (N −2) potential and ac-
counted for excessively in the V (N ) potential which is
used, for example, in Ref. [14]. One practical solution to
this problem is to use “optimized” denominators [14]. A
consistent theory requires an ab-initio treatment of the
denominator problem. Basing calculations of atoms with
two valence electrons on a more realistic potential can
reduce uncertainties in the choice of the denominator in
the self-energy corrections.

We calculated energies of several levels using the CI
averaging method and found that the best agreement
with experiment for Be and Mg was obtained with ǫ0
equal to 1/2 of the CI energy. For the case of Ca, the
best agreement was obtained choosing ǫ0 between 1/2
and 1 times the CI energy. One advantage of the CI av-
eraging method is that the basic CI code is simple and
that the CI wave functions can be stored and used many
times. A cut-oﬀ condition can be imposed, as a compro-
mise between speed and accuracy. The fastest approxi-
mation (giving the poorest accuracy) is obtained by re-
stricting the MBPT corrections to the leading conﬁgura-
tions. We used this leading conﬁguration approximation
to estimate the magnitude of the core-excitation eﬀects
as the ﬁrst step in developing our computer code. Ad-
justing the cut-oﬀ condition, we readily reached a high
level of accuracy (ﬁnally we chose the cut-oﬀ condition
< 0.002 for all calculations). The energies for
cI cK|
|
several states of Be, Mg, and Ca presented in this paper
have been calculated with the CI averaging method. The
principal drawback of this method is that wave functions
necessary for calculations of other properties are not au-
tomatically obtained.

2. Brueckner-Orbital CI

The eﬀective Hamiltonian formalism [12] leads to the
problem of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix built on
the frozen-core two-electron conﬁguration state functions

3

ΦI . We split this matrix into functionally distinct pieces:

H = H (0) + H (1) + H (2),

(10)

where H (0) is the zeroth-order Dirac-Fock Hamiltonian,
which in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) basis is

H (0)

v′w′vw = δvv′ δww′

ǫ0
v + ǫ0
w
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

,

and H (1) is the ﬁrst-order electron-electron interaction
Hamiltonian

H (1)

v′w′vw = V (1)

v′w′vw,

deﬁned in Ref.[12]. H (2) is the second-order correction
which consists of the two-particle screening correction
and the one-particle self-energy correction deﬁned pre-
viously. In the CI averaging method, H (0) + H (1) is diag-
onalized ﬁrst in a DHF basis (where H (0) is diagonal) to
give state energies and CI wave functions, then H (2) is
evaluated using the CI wave functions to give corrections
for the core-valence interaction.

In the Brueckner-orbital (BO) CI method, the ba-
sis functions are chosen as orthonormal solutions of the
quasi-particle equation,

[h0 + VHF + Σij(ǫ)]φj = ǫBOφi.

(11)

In this BO basis,

H (0) + H self

= δvv′ δww′(ǫBO

v + ǫBO

w ).

(12)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)v′w′vw

The basis orbitals include second-order self-energy cor-
rections together with the lowest-order DHF potential.
The residual non-trivial part of the eﬀective Hamilto-
nian in the BO basis is the sum H (1) + H screen. In the
Bruckner orbital-CI method, the residual Hamiltonian
matrix is evaluated in the BO basis and diagonalized to
obtain state energies and CI wave functions. The BO-
CI method is equivalent to CI averaging method if we
neglect energy diﬀerences in the denominators of H self
and H screen (of order of the valence-valence interaction
energy), which are small compared to the core excitation
energies. The BO-CI method is also equivalent to the
eﬀective Hamiltonian method in [14] to the same level
of precision, provided all second-order diagrams are in-
cluded. Some advantage is gained in accuracy compared
to the CI averaging method, since the largest valence-core
corrections [those from Σij(ǫ0)] are taken into account to
inﬁnite order.

The Brueckner-orbital CI method is very convenient
for calculations of transition amplitudes; once the resid-
ual interaction is diagonalized, the associated wave func-
tions are immediately available. We include random-
phase approximation (RPA) corrections in calculations
of transition amplitudes by replacing “bare” matrix el-
ements with “dressed” elements as explained in [20].
Length-form and velocity-form dipole matrix elements
are found to be in close agreement in BO-CI calculations
that include RPA corrections.

III. CALCULATIONS OF SPECTRA USING CI
AVERAGING

The CI averaging method is fast and convenient for
calculations of energies when a large number of levels are
needed, especially at the stage of adjusting the code pa-
rameters. Below, we present our calculations for many
levels of Be, Mg, and Ca atoms to demonstrate the accu-
racy of this method. We evaluate the valence-core cor-
rection ∆Evc to the CI energy using a subset of the CI
coeﬃcients limited to those satisfying
0.002.
The parameter ǫ0 in the self-energy was chosen to be
ǫCI/2 for Be and Mg. For calcium it was increased to
3ǫCI/4 to obtain better agreement for energies of the 4p2
states.

cI cK| ≤
|

The basis set used to set up the calculations consisted
of 25/40 DHF basis functions for each value of l
5.
The basis functions were formed as linear combinations
of B-splines of order 7, constrained to a cavity of radius
R=80 a0.

A. Calculations for Be

We chose to study a Be atom for several reasons. First,
this atom has a small core and, consequently, requires
relatively little computation time. Second, because of the
small size of the core-valence interaction, calculations for
Be are expected to be very precise.

A comparison of the resulting CI energies with mea-
sured energies from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) database [22] is shown in Table I.
This comparison provides the ﬁrst test of the CI averag-
ing method. The values listed in the table agree with
experiment at the level of tens of cm−1. The residual
deviation can be explained as neglect of small Coulomb
and Breit diagrams, which will be the subject of future
investigations.

It is also interesting to compare CI energies, with and
without the MBPT corrections ∆Evc, with energies from
the NIST database. Such a comparison is given in Ta-
ble II and illustrates the importance of the valence-core
corrections.

The agreement with experiment improves by an order
of magnitude for the CI-averaging method as compared
with a frozen-core CI calculation.
Indeed, we found it
necessary to use the more precise energies obtained from
the CI-averaging method to properly identify the transi-
tions shown in this table.

B. Calculations for Mg

Another example where the CI averaging method pre-
dicts energy levels accurately is magnesium. In this atom,
however, core correlations are larger and the treatment
of the valence-core interaction term requires more careful
analysis. One important aspect is choosing the parame-
ter ǫ0 in the denominators of the MBPT corrections, an-
other is the treatment of self-energy diagrams. We found
mild sensitivity of ﬁnal energies in Mg to the choice of
ǫ0. The corrected energies shown in the column headed
‘CI + 2nd’ in Table III, which were obtained with the
choice ǫ0 = ǫCI/2, are seen to be in close agreement with
experimental energies [22].

Typically, the self-energy correction is much larger
than other valence-core diagrams; for example, in the
10−2 a.u.
Mg ground state, the self-energy is
while the screening contribution is ten times smaller,
10−3 a.u. Valence-core contributions in fourth-
1.83
order, obtained by iterating (or chaining) the second-
order Brueckner corrections are also found to be signiﬁ-
10−4 a.u. for the Mg ground state. The ef-
cant,
fect of including corrections from chaining the self-energy
shown in the column headed ‘CI + 4th’ in Table III is
seen to further improve the agreement with experiment.

C. Ca atom

In Table IV, several even parity J = 0 levels are calcu-
lated with the frozen-core CI and CI-averaging methods.
Compared to the frozen-core CI method, the agreement
is signiﬁcantly improved with the addition of MBPT cor-
rections, changing the diﬀerence between experiment and
theory from approximately one thousand cm−1 to a few
hundred cm−1. This signiﬁcant change clearly indicates
the importance of the valence-core interaction, which is
much stronger than in the case of Be and Mg. As a
result, the ﬁnal accuracy of CI+MBPT method is also
lower than for the lighter atoms. While the poor accu-
racy of frozen CI energies prevents the identiﬁcation of
energy levels, more accurate CI+MBPT energies permit
one to identify many Ca levels. It is interesting to notice
that the sequence of experimental levels for the states of
a particular symmetry is the same as the sequence of the-
oretical eigenvalues. Once the question of classiﬁcation
is solved, various properties of atoms can be calculated
using, for example, frozen-core CI.

In the case of Ca, another problem that needs atten-
tion is the choice of the parameter ǫ0 in the self-energy,

the dominant part of the core-valence interaction. We
ﬁnd that there is an optimal value of this parameter be-
tween ǫCI /2, our standard value for Be and Mg, and
ǫCI, for which the ground state becomes very accurate.
In Table IV we chose this parameter to be 0.75 ǫCI. In
the following section, we will illustrate our calculations of
transition amplitudes for several levels of Mg, Ca, and Sr
where other precise calculations and measurements exist.

IV. CALCULATIONS USING THE
BRUECKNER-ORBITAL CI METHOD

HF

In this section, we present our calculations of energies
and transition amplitudes with the Brueckner-orbital CI
method. Our basis consisted of 25 V N −2
orbitals (those
orbitals were constructed of 40 B-splines in the cavity
80 a.u.), in which 14 lowest excited states were replaced
with Brueckner orbitals. The resulting one-valence elec-
tron energies for the divalent atoms were tested by com-
paring with experimental energies for the corresponding
monovalent ions. For Mg+, the BO energies agree with
experiment better than do the second-order energies (Ta-
ble V). A second iteration of the BO equation was also
included in the CI-averaging method (Table III) to im-
prove accuracy. The small size of the residual devia-
tion from experiment in both tables can be attributed
to higher-order diagrams. Two-particle screening cor-
rections with the restriction n < 15 were included in
the eﬀective Hamiltonian, diagonalization of which pro-
vided the initial and ﬁnal state wave functions necessary
for the calculation of transition amplitudes. We checked
that restrictions on the number of BO and screening di-
agrams included in the calculation did not lead to sig-
niﬁcant errors. Dressed transition amplitudes were used
to take into account RPA corrections, which provide bet-
ter length- and velocity-form agreement. We completely
neglected the extremely time consuming structural ra-
diation corrections which are expected to be small for
the length form; for this reason, the result calculated

in length form should be considered as more accurate.
Small normalization corrections are also omitted.

A. Be case

−

The most accurate results for divalent atoms are ex-
pected for Be since it contains the smallest MBPT cor-
rections. In Table VI, we compare our calculations with
available precise calculations and experiment. Transi-
tion energies agree with experiment to better than 0.1%,
except for the transition 2s3s1S
2s2p1P which has
0.4% accuracy. Our oscillator strengths agree well with
those obtained in very accurate ab-initio calculations of
Ref. [23] and in semiempirical calculations of Ref. [1] that
reproduce energies very closely; for the principal transi-
tion 2s21S
2s2p1P , our value 1.375 diﬀers by 1 in the
4th digit from the value 1.374 in Ref. [23], the accuracy
being better than 0.1%, and coincides with the value of
Ref. [1]. Very close agreement with ab-initio theory is
also achieved for the transition 2s3s1S
2s3p1P . For
suppressed transitions, an accuracy of 1% is obtained.
Conducting a simple statistical analysis, we found that

−

−

energy diﬀerences in the CI-averaging and BO-CI calcula-
tions have similar statistical errors, but slightly diﬀerent
systematic shifts which can be explained partially by dif-
ferent denominators in the two methods. Another reason
is the cut-oﬀ condition 0.002 in the former method and
restriction on the number of Brueckner orbitals in the
latter. The eﬀect of the partial wave restriction on the
ground state energy in both methods is 6 cm−1. If this
value is accounted for, the agreement becomes slightly
better. The results in our tables are not extrapolated
owing to the smallness of the omitted partial wave con-
tributions.

B. The cases of Mg, Ca, and Sr

The accuracy of both the CI-averaging and the BO-
CI calculations considered above decreases from light to
heavy divalent atoms. Table VII illustrates this tendency
in BO-CI calculations:
for Mg, the theory-experiment
diﬀerences range within 50 cm−1, similar to what we
have in Table III, and for Ca the deviation from exper-
iment increases to about 200 cm−1 which is comparable
to that in Table IV. The lowest accuracy is for Sr, which
has the largest core and MBPT corrections. Similar re-

sults for energies have been obtained in Ref.[14]. Our
experiment-theory diﬀerences exhibit a systematic shift,
which if subtracted, brings results into better agreement.
For example, in Ca this shift is 216 cm−1. After its sub-
traction, the residual deviation is 73 cm−1. This subtrac-
tion procedure can be used in cases where closely spaced
levels are diﬃcult to identify. The systematic shift can
be attributed to omitted correlations that aﬀect mostly
the ground state which is used as a reference. The cut-oﬀ
condition in the CI-averaging method and restrictions on
the number of BO and screening diagrams also has some
eﬀect on the accuracy of our results. This is one reason
why the two methods give slightly diﬀerent energies. In
future development of our computer code, we will try to
remove such restrictions completely. Another reason why
the two methods give diﬀerent results is that the choices
of ǫ0 were diﬀerent. In Table VIII, we illustrate our calcu-
lations of transition amplitudes for Mg, Ca, Sr. All of our
transition amplitudes completely agree with those of re-
cent CI+MBPT calculations by Porsev et al. [14], and are
close to experimental values. Length-form and velocity-
form amplitudes agree to better than 1% for allowed tran-
sitions. Forbidden transitions are more problematic, ow-
ing to cancellation eﬀects, and have poorer agreement
between gauges and with experiment. The inclusion of
the Breit interaction and negative-energy contributions,
which are more important for the velocity form, might
improve the situation. We also noticed that, if the bal-
ance between states such as p1/2 and p3/2 in relativistic
basis is not properly maintained, the results for nonrela-
tivistically forbidden transitions will be unstable. In ad-
dition, those transitions were aﬀected by the number of
BO and screening diagrams included in calculations. To
minimize or exclude those eﬀects in the BO-CI method,
the BO orbitals and cut-oﬀ conditions were made com-
pletely symmetric with respect to l + 1/2 and l
1/2
orbitals and included BO and screening corrections with
number of excited orbitals less than 15.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have introduced two methods to im-
prove the accuracy of the frozen-core CI calculations us-
ing MBPT: the CI-averaging method and the Brueckner-
orbital CI method. We have applied these methods to Be,
Mg, Ca, and Sr atoms. Our calculated energies and tran-
sition amplitudes for those atoms are in close agreement
with the results of the best available theories and experi-
ments. Compared to semiempirical theories, our method
has an advantage in accuracy, and compared to other
ab-initio theories, an advantage of simplicity. These two
methods can also be used to evaluate properties of Ry-
dberg states for which only semiempirical calculations

7

exist. Further improvement in accuracy is possible and
is being pursued. This theory can be extended easily
to treat particle-hole excited states of closed-shell atoms,
atoms with three valence electrons, and other more com-

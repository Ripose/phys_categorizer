Abstract
The Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen continues to be a subject of experimental and
theoretical investigation. Here my older work on the subject is updated to provide a
complementary calculation of the energies of the 2p-2s transitions in muonic hydrogen.

Introduction
The energy levels of muonic atoms are very sensitive to eﬀects of quantum electrodynamics
(QED), nuclear structure, and recoil, since the muon is about 206 times heavier than the
electron [1]. In view of a proposed measurement of the Lamb shift im muonic hydrogen [2],
an improved theoretical analysis seems to be desirable. Since the ﬁrst theoretical analysis
[3], the subject of the Lamb shift (the 2p-2s transition) in light muonic atoms has been
investigated with increasing precision by a number of authors [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The
present paper provides an independent recalculation of some of the most important eﬀects,
including hyperﬁne structure, and a new calculation of some terms that were omitted
in the most recent literature, such as the virtual Delbr¨uck eﬀect [11]. An alternative
calculation of the relativistic recoil correction is presented.

In the numerical calculations the fundamental constants from the CODATA 1998 ([12])
fm, 105.658357 MeV,

are used, i.e.: α−1, ~c, mµ, me, mu = 137.0359998, 197.32696 MeV
·
0.5109989 MeV, 931.4940 MeV, respectively.

Vacuum Polarization
The most important QED eﬀect for muonic atoms is the virtual production and anni-
hilation of a single e+e− pair It has as a consequence an eﬀective interaction of order
αZα which is usually called the Uehling potential ([13, 14]. This interaction describes
the most important modiﬁcation of Coulomb’s law. Numerically it is so important that it
should not be treated using perturbation theory; instead the Uehling potential should be
added to the nuclear electrostatic potential before solving the Dirac equation. However,
a perturbative treatment is also useful in the case of very light atoms, such as hydrogen.
Unlike some other authors, we prefer to use relativistic (Dirac) wave functions to
describe the muonic orbit. This is more exact, and as will be seen below, it makes a

1

diﬀerence for at least the most important contributions. The wave functions are given in
the book of Akhiezer and Berestetskii [15] and will not be given here. In perturbation
theory, the energy shift due to an eﬀective potential ∆V is given by

U2(q) is deﬁned in [1]. The vacuum polarization corrections were calculated in momentum
space; the formulas (124,125,127) of [1] are completely equivalent to (200) in [10].
If
2s1/2 is calculated in lowest order perturbation
the correction to the transition 2p1/2 −
theory using nonrelativistic point Coulomb wave functions, the result is 205.0074 meV, in
agreement with other authors [10].

The same procedure was used to calculate the two-loop corrections; the corresponding
diagrams were ﬁrst calculated by K¨allen and Sabry [16]. The Fourier transform of the
corresponding potential is given in [1, 4]. The result for a point nucleus is 1.5080 meV.

In momentum space including the eﬀect of nuclear size on the Uehling potential is
trivial, since the corresponding expression for ∆V (q) is simply multiplied by the form
factor. The numbers obtained were the same for a dipole form factor and for a Gaussian
form factor, provided the parameters were adjusted to reproduce the experimental rms
radius of the proton. The correction can be regarded as taking into account the eﬀect
of ﬁnite nuclear size on the virtual electron-positron pair in the loop. The contribution
of the Uehling potential to the 2p-2s transition is reduced by 0.0081 meV with a proton
radius of 0.862 fm [17], and by 0.0085 meV with a proton radius of 0.880 fm [18]. This
result is consistent with the number given in [10] (eq.(266)). More recent values for the
proton radius have been given by Sick [19] (0.895
0.018 fm) and in the newest CODATA
compilation [20] (0.875

0.007 fm).

However higher iterations can change these results. For a very crude estimate, one can
scale previous results for helium [5] and assume that the ratio of nonperturbative to
perturbative contributions was the same, giving a contribution of 0.175 meV.
The contribution due to two and three iterations have been calculated by [8] and [23],
respectively, giving a total of 0.151 meV. The best way to calculate this would be an
accurate numerical solution of the Dirac equation in the combined Coulomb-plus Uehling
potential.

The mixed muon-electron vacuum polarization correction was recalculated and gave

the same result as obtained previously, namely 0.00007 meV. [21, 10].

The Wichmann-Kroll [22] contribution was calculated using the parametrization for
the potential given in [1]. The result obtained (-0.00103 meV) is consistent with that
given in [10], but not with that given in [8].

The equivalent potential for the virtual Delbr¨uck eﬀect was recomputed from the
Fourier transform given in [11] and [1]. The resulting potential was checked by reproducing
previously calculated results for the 2s-2p transition in muonic helium, and the 3d-2p
transitions in muonic Mg and Si. The result for hydrogen is +(0.00135
0.00015) meV.
As in the case of muonic helium, this contribution very nearly cancels the Wichmann-Kroll
contribution. The contribution corresponding to three photons to the muon and one to
the proton should be analogous to the light by light contribution to the muon anomalous
moment; to my knowledge, the corresponding contribution to the muon form factor has
never been calculated. It will be comparable to the other light by light contributions. For
an estimate, the correction to the Lamb shift due to the contribution to the anomalous
magnetic moment was calculated; it amounts to (-)0.00002 meV; the contribution to the
muon form factor is one of the most signiﬁcant unknown corrections.

The sixth order vacuum polarization corrections to the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen

It is entirely possible that the as-yet uncalculated light by light contribution will give a
comparable contribution.

The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution has been estimated by a number of
authors [24, 25, 10].
It amounts to about 0.012 meV. One point that should not be
forgotten about the hadronic VP correction is the fact that the sum rule or dispersion
relation that everyone (including myself) used does not take into account the fact that
the proton (nucleus) can in principle interact strongly with the hadrons in the virtual
hadron loop. This is irrelevant for the anomalous magnetic moment but probably not for
muonic atoms. An estimation of this eﬀect appears to be extremely diﬃcult, and could
[10] point out that the graph
easily change the correction by up to 50%. Eides et al.
related to hadronic vacuum polarization can also contriibute to the measured value of the

nuclear charge distribution (and polarizability). It is not easy to determine where the
contribution should be assigned.

of them. Clearly the neglected terms are not negligible. There is also a contribution of
10−6 meV to the binding energy of the 2p1/2-level, and a recoil correction of 0.012 meV

Relativistic Recoil
As is well-known, the center-of-mass motion can be separated exactly from the relative
motion only in the nonrelativistic limit. Relativistic corrections have been studied by
many authors, and will not be reviewed here. The relativistic recoil corrections summa-
rized in [1] include the eﬀect of ﬁnite nuclear size to leading order in mµ/mN properly.

Up to now this method has been used to treat recoil corrections to vacuum polarization
only in the context of extensive numerical calculations that include the Uehling potential
in the complete potential, as described in [1]. They can be included explicitly, as a
perturbation correction to point-Coulomb values. Recall that (to leading order in 1/mN ),

a model for the charge distribution is given. This done by Friar [26] (and conﬁrmed
independently for two diﬀerent model charge distributions); the contribution due to ﬁnite
nuclear size to the recoil correction for the binding energy of the 2s-level is -0.013 meV. The
factor 1/mn is replaced by 1/(mµ + mN ), also consistent with the calculations presented
in [26].

Since vacuum polarization is assumed to be a relatively small correction to the Coulomb
potential, it will be suﬃcient to approximate Q2(r) by αZ/r. After some algebra, one can

When multiplied by 1/(mµ + mN ) this results in a shift of 0.002475 meV for the 2s-state
and of 0.000238 meV for the 2p-state.

Combining these expectation values according to equations 6 and 7, one ﬁnds a
contribution to the 2p-2s transition of -0.00419 meV. To obtain the full relativistic and
recoil corrections, one must add the diﬀerence between the expectation values of the
Uehling potential calculated with relativistic and nonrelativistic wave functions, giving
a total correction of 0.0166 meV. This is in fairly good agreement with the correction

6

of .0169 meV calculated by Veitia and Pachucki [31], using a generalization of the Breit
equation [32] which is similar to that given in [6]. The treatment presented here has the
advantage of avoiding second order perturbation theory.

The review by Eides et.al [10] gives a better version of the two photon recoil (Eq. 136)
than was available for the review by Borie and G. Rinker [1]. Evaluating this expression
for muonic hydrogen gives a contribution of -0.04497 meV to the 2p-2s transition. Higher
order radiative recoil corrections give an additional contribution of -0.0096 meV [10].

Muon Lamb Shift
For the calculation of muon self-energy and vacuum polarization, the lowest order (one-
loop approximation) contribution is well-known, at least in perturbation theory. Including
also muon vacuum polarization (0.0168 meV) and an extra term of order (Zα)5 as given

[32, 10]) which gives the energy shift as the expectation value of

where ε2p is given by Eq.(13). In this case, the terms involving aµ in the expression for
the muon Lamb shift are included, and should not be double counted. With a numerical
value of ε2p = 0.000365, one ﬁnds a contribution of 0.00305 meV (compared with 0.005 meV
using Dirac wave functions).

Numerically, the terms not involving aµ give a contribution of 8.3291 meV and the
contribution from aµ gives a contribution of 0.0176 meV, for a total of 8.3467 meV, in
good agreement with Eq. 80 of [8]. This is only slightly diﬀerent from the Dirac value of
8.352 meV. The contribution due to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is the
same in both cases.

In both cases one should include the B2/2MN -type correction to the ﬁne structure.

but with improved accuracy. Most of the formalism and results are similar to those given
by [8].

The other contribution, as discussed by [34, 35] arises from the fact that the lower

region where vacuum polarization is large. This results in an additional energy shift of

due to the weak interaction or hadronic vacuum polarization should be even smaller.
For muonic hydrogen, one obtains εV P 1=0.00211 and εV P 2=0.00325 for a point nucleus.
Including the eﬀect of the proton size (with GE(q) = GM (q) as a dipole form factor)

[7], the corresponding numbers are εV P 1=0.00286 and εV P 2=0.00476. The contribution
to the hyperﬁne splitting of the 2s-state is then 0.0470 meV+0.0733 meV=0.1203 meV
(0.1212 meV if muonic vacuum polarization is included). The combined Breit and vertex
corrections reduce this value to 0.1207 meV. (0.1226 meV if the proton form factors are
not taken into account).

The contribution to the hyperﬁne structure from the two loop diagrams [16] can be
calculated by replacing U2(αZmrK) = (α/3π)F (φ) by U4(αZmrK) (as given in [1, 4]) in
10−5, respectively,
equations 18 and 19. The resulting contributions are 1.64

Summary of contributions and Conclusions
The most important contributions to the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen,
including
hyperﬁne structure, have been independently recalculated. A new calculation of some
terms that were omitted in the most recent literature, such as the virtual Delbr¨uck eﬀect
[11] and an alternative calculation of the relativistic recoil correction have been presented.

Numerically the results given in table 1 add up to a total correction of

(206.032(6) - 5.225
0.12 meV. (for the value of the
proton radius from [20]). As is well known, most of the uncertainty arises from the
uncertainty in the proton radius.

In this work we introduce a new expression of the plasma Dielecronic Recombination (DR) rate as
a function of the temperature, derived assuming a small deformation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution and containing corrective factors, in addition to the usual exponential behaviour,

caused by non-linear effects in slightly non ideal plasmas. We then compare the calculated DR
rates with the experimental DR ﬁts in the low temperature region.

Dielectronic Recombination Rates In Astrophysical Plasmas

Fatima Bachari

1. Introduction

Dielectronic Recombination (DR) plays a central role in astrophysics. It is the most impor-
tant electron-ion recombination process in photoionized cosmic plasmas. Moreover, DR rates are
used to model different astrophysical systems as stellar and solar coronae and the intergalactic
medium [1, 2]. Theoretical and experimental uncertainties in the low temperature DR rates can
dramatically change the values of parameters describing the properties of the cosmic plasmas and
the interpretation of data from satellites on cosmic systems.

Actually, the quality and accuracy of the laboratory experiments on DR processes with collid-
ing beams of electrons and ions are very high and atomic codes to evaluate transition amplitudes
rather sophisticated [3, 4]. The transfer of knowledge obtained from laboratory measurements of
the DR rates to astrophysical plasma modelling is based on the assumption that the electron beam
of the cooling device can be described with a Maxwellian distribution with energy spread as low
as about 10 meV (experimentally veriﬁed) and that the astrophysical plasma be in a state of global
thermodynamical equilibrium or in a LTE with a Maxwellian distribution over a wide range of
temperature from 10−

3 eV to 106 eV.

On the contrary, signals of deviations from LTE in astrophysical plasmas have been observed
and reported in the past [5, 6] and, as a very recent result, astrophysical X-ray sources active in
stellar coronae, active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, supernovae and after-glows from gamma-ray
bursts indicate the presence of a departure from Maxwellian distribution of the particles in many
different types of plasmas [7].

We have recently shown that, in electron cooling devices, generalized electron distributions
that differ from the Maxwellian one in the low energy part, due to subdiffusion of electrons and
ions, with depleted energy tails, may account for the observed enhancement in Radiative Recombi-
nation (RR) and that the existence of a cut-off in the momentum distribution (as the one introduced
in astrophysics by Spitzer in the past [8]) could have important consequences on the X-ray spectra
emitted during RR [9].

In this work we introduce a new expression of the plasma DR rate as a function of the tem-
perature, derived assuming a small deformation of the Maxwell distribution and containing factors
that modify the usual, well known exponential behaviour. Deviations are caused by presence of
correlations among particles in non ideal plasmas, of random electric microﬁelds distribution and
of random forces whose effects are non linear [10, 11]. All these effects are taken into account by
means of an appropriate parameter q, which is the entropic parameter of the nonextensive Tsallis
thermostatistics [12, 13]. Among many generalised statistics, this is the one (together with Renyi
statistics) which introduces a cut-off in the energy distribution when particles sub-diffuse (q < 1) .
We apply this new DR rate to the study of the C3+ case, as for carbon ions there exist ex-
perimental data and theoretical calculations we can use in our semi-phenomenological treatment
and may compare with our results. We want to show what is the effect of the deformation on the
plasma DR rate and calculate, in particular, the rate at low temperature. The same application will
be extended elsewhere to the DR of Fe ions exploiting the experimental and theoretical results of
Ref. [14].

With a pure Maxwellian distribution, for any kBT , the energy tail contains particles of high
energy. If the lowest resonance level contributing to the DR rate lies at Eres,i > kBT , the factor

106 K has a value of plasma parameter that strongly differs
from the value at T = 102
103 K if the electron density does not diminish of the factor 109. The
correlations among the particles are different in the two extreme cases and therefore the plasma
does not preserve its Maxwellian behaviour. We must consider at each value of the plasma param-
eter a given deviation from the ideal case and thus a different degree of non-extensivity described
by a suitable value of the parameter d . For instance, above 105 K, we assume d = 0, because the
system is Maxwellian, having a plasma parameter much smaller than one, while for T < 103 K, we
could assume d = 0.2.

We chose to restrict ourselves to a temperature range between T = 0.8

103 K and T = 104 K,
in order to work with a ﬁxed value of d only. We report in Fig. 1 two plots (for d = 0.05 and
d = 0.15, corresponding to q = 0.9 and q = 0.7, respectively) of the DR plasma rate 2.2 for C3+
(curve 1); only the 21 resonance levels reported by Mannervik et al. [16] between 0.176 eV (i.e.
103 K) have been included. Resonance levels above 0.586 eV were

As a comparison, the curve 2 represents the experimental ﬁt (Burgess DR rate) of Schippers et
al. [3], with ﬁve ﬁtting levels distributed between 0.169 eV and 7.969 eV. In Ref. [3], while below
T = 104 K experimental data are used, above T = 104 K the authors use theoretical calculations
from the AUTOSTRUCTURE code. The method for obtaining the ﬁt curve 2 is based on converting
the laboratory experimental DR rate, as function of the relative energy, into a cross section and
convoluting it with an isotropic Maxwellian electron energy distribution.

In curve 3, we report the Maxwellian rate from Eq. 2.4, with d = 0 and g i

= 0; again this
Maxwellian curve contains only the 21 levels of Mannervik et al. [16]. This curve is always higher
than the curve 2: a possible explanation could be that the strengths of the most important levels,
considered in Ref. [16], are too large.

resonances (thick dashed line); 2) the ﬁt from Schippers et al. [3], used for comparison with our results (thin

The a DR

considered.

As evident from Fig. 1, the effect of the deformation is to increase the value of the maximum,
with a small shift of its position towards higher temperatures, and to lower the rate of curve 1 below
103 K. This is due to the fact that the resonance levels considered are all
the curve 2 for T < 0.8
above this low temperature.

3. Conclusions

In conclusion, with the correction introduced due to small deformations of the electron distri-
bution, the calculated corrected DR rate agrees with the experimental ﬁt at low temperature, which
is given with an uncertainty of about 20 per cent.

We remark that when using information obtained in laboratory DR experiments on the DR rate
to discuss properties of astrophysical plasmas, we must consider the different state of deformation
in the distribution function of the laboratory and the astrophysical plasmas, if both are not in the
Maxwellian equilibrium state.

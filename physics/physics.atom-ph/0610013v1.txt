A hierarchical ordering is demonstrated for the periodic orbits in a strongly coupled multidimen-
sional Hamiltonian system, namely the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. It
mirrors the hierarchy of broken resonant tori and thereby allows one to characterize the periodic
orbits by a set of winding numbers. With this knowledge, we construct the action variables as
functions of the frequency ratios and carry out a semiclassical torus quantization. The semiclassical
energy levels thus obtained agree well with exact quantum calculations.

INTRODUCTION

The hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic
ﬁelds is among the paradigmatic examples of strongly
coupled multidimensional systems. During the last two
decades, a large number of experimental and theoretical
investigations (eg., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13])
have been devoted to the intricate physics of this seem-
ingly elementary nonintegrable system. In addition to its
inherent interest, the hydrogen atom in crossed ﬁelds can
be used to study generic phenomena such as Arnold diﬀu-
sion [10], monodromy [11] or Ericson ﬂuctuations [12, 13].
Its deeper understanding also provides a solid basis to
explore the behavior of conﬁned electrons in condensed
matter physics, such as in excitons [14] and quantum dots
[15]. Yet, in spite of the large amount of work spent upon
it, the overall phase space structure of the crossed-ﬁelds
hydrogen atom still deﬁes a complete understanding.

One of the most prominent features of a dynamical
system are its periodic orbits (POs). While individual
POs can yield deep insights into the local dynamics, in
their entirety they provide an appropriate tool to under-
stand the global structure of a multidimensional phase
space [16]. Their knowledge is crucial in many appli-
cations of classical dynamical systems such as astron-
omy [16, 17, 18], particle accelerators [19] and ﬂuid dy-
namics, e.g. statistics of turbulent ﬂow [20]. The semi-
classical quantization of the classical structures is an in-
valuable tool for the description of molecular vibrations
[21, 22, 23], chemical reactions [24] or the spectra of Ry-
dberg atoms [2, 9].

In this work we establish an organizing principle for
POs in the crossed-ﬁelds hydrogen atom. It allows the
identiﬁcation of winding numbers for every PO that
originates from the breakup of a torus. Conversely,
through this classiﬁcation the POs elucidate the higher-

dimensional structures of the phase space and allow one
to characterize their topology. They enable us to recon-
struct the hierarchy of broken tori with suﬃcient pre-
cision to carry out an Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK)
torus quantization [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].

The electron motion of a hydrogen atom exposed to
an electric ﬁeld F in the x direction and a magnetic ﬁeld
B in the z direction, is governed by the Hamiltonian, in
atomic units [30],

Here r = (x, y, z) are the usual Cartesian coordinates,
p = (px, py, pz) the conjugate momenta, and r =
x2 + y2 + z2. By virtue of the scaling properties [31]
of the Hamiltonian (1), if all classical quantities are mul-
p
tiplied by suitable powers of the magnetic ﬁeld strength,
the dynamics can be shown not to depend on the energy
E and the ﬁeld strengths B and F separately, but only
on the scaled energy ˜E = B−2/3E and the scaled electric
ﬁeld strength ˜F = B−4/3F .
In particular, coordinates
scale according to ˜r = B2/3r and the classical actions
obey ˜S = B1/3S. In this paper, we present results for a
scaled electric ﬁeld strength ˜F = 0.5 and two scaled ener-
gies ˜E = −1.5 and ˜E = −1.4 slightly below and slightly
above the classical ionization threshold ˜EI = −2
˜F , re-
spectively.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II
we give a brief general review of the phase space struc-
tures in Hamiltonian systems that are relevant to our
investigations. Sec. III explains the dynamical princi-
ples underlying the organization of periodic orbits and
summarizes the organization of periodic orbits of the hy-
drogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In
Sec. IV we describe this organization in detail and show
how it can be exploited to assign winding numbers to the

periodic orbits. Sec. V presents the calculation of action
variables from the information thus obtained. A semi-
classical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization is carried
out in Sec. VI, and conclusions are given in Sec. VII.

II. PHASE SPACE STRUCTURES IN
HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS

Among all Hamiltonian systems, those that exhibit the
most regular dynamics are the integrable systems, where
almost every bounded trajectory is conﬁned to an in-
variant torus. At the other extreme, in ergodic systems
almost every trajectory comes arbitrarily close to every
energetically allowed point in phase space. In this work
we treat the crossed-ﬁelds hydrogen atom in a parameter
range where the phase space structure is dominated by
the remnants of invariant tori. Nevertheless, the external
ﬁelds are chosen too strong for perturbation theory to be
a reliable tool, and we will consider the full nonintegrable
Hamiltonian (1).

By deﬁnition, a Hamiltonian system with f degrees of
freedom is integrable if it possesses f constants of motion
in involution. The regular level sets of these constants
are f -dimensional tori if they are compact [32, 33]. For
singular values of the constants, tori of lower dimensions
can arise. Tori of diﬀerent dimensions form a hierarchy
in which the tori of dimension N are organized around
the tori of dimension N − 1. Such hierarchies have been
observed in a variety of diﬀerent systems (see, e.g., [11,
21, 34]). In the following sections, we will demonstrate
how this hierarchy of tori in an integrable limit can give
rise to a hierarchy of isolated POs in a nonintegrable
system and how these POs can in turn be used to gain
information on the original hierarchy of invariant tori.

In an integrable system, action-angle variables (I, θ)
with the following properties can be introduced. The
angles θ determine the position on an individual torus.
They increase linearly with time

θ = ωt + θ0,

with a constant frequency vector ω and initial conditions
θ0. The conjugate action variables I are constants of mo-
tion and characterize the invariant tori. They are given
by

(3)

Ii =

2π Iγi

pdq,

where γi is the loop on the torus obtained as the angle
θi varies from 0 to 2π with all other angles held ﬁxed.

The action variables (3) form the basis for a semi-
classical torus quantization [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Find-
ing them explicitly, however, is a highly nontrivial task.
Due to its signiﬁcance in applications such as the cal-
culation of molecular vibration spectra, the construction
of the invariant tori has attracted considerable attention
[35, 36, 37].

In an integrable system, the Hamiltonian can be writ-
ten as a function of the action variables only, and the
frequencies ω in (2) are given by
∂H
∂Ii

ωi =

.

If the ratios of any two of the ωi on a torus are rational,
that torus carries periodic orbits and is called a resonant
torus. In this case, a set w of integer winding numbers
can be found so that

ω1 : ω2 : . . . : ωn = w1 : w2 : . . . : wn.

(5)

Each winding number wi speciﬁes the number of rota-
tions along the direction of the fundamental loop γi that
the POs execute before repeating themselves.

Angle coordinates θ on a given torus can be deﬁned
in various ways. Apart from a choice of origin, which
is inconsequential, any two angle coordinate systems are
related by a linear transformation
= M · θ

(6)

θ′

where M is an n × n integer matrix with unit determi-
nant [38]. The action coordinates must be transformed
according to

whereas the winding numbers on a rational torus trans-
form as

I′

= (M T)

−1 · I,

w′ = M · w.

This freedom to choose diﬀerent action-angle coordinate
systems, together with the intimate connection between
coordinate systems and winding numbers, will play a cru-
cial role in our investigation of the phase space topology.
In a non-integrable system, a resonant torus breaks
up into isolated POs [32, 39, 40]. We use these POs as
representatives of the torus they stem from and call them
N -torus POs, where N is the dimension of the original
torus. According to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)
theory [32, 33], most nonresonant tori remain intact in
a near-integrable system and break up only gradually.
They are interspersed with the isolated POs in the same
way as resonant and nonresonant tori are interspersed
in an integrable system. Therefore, POs can be used to
investigate the structure of the surviving tori.

According to the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ theorem [32, 33,
39], a 2-torus in a two-degree-of-freedom system breaks
up into an even number of isolated POs, usually two.
One of the POs is stable (“elliptic”), the other is unstable
(“hyperbolic”). Because both POs stem from the same
torus, their periods and actions diﬀer only slightly.

For systems with three degrees of freedom, Kook and
Meiss [40] were able to derive from symmetry consider-
ations that a 3-torus breaks up into four isolated POs
that usually represent the four possible stability combi-
nations: one PO elliptic in both degrees of freedom (ee),
one PO hyperbolic in both degrees of freedom (hh) and
two POs elliptic in one degree of freedom and hyperbolic
in the second (eh and he).

˜E = −1.5 (a) and ˜E = −1.4 (b), where S− is already strongly
deformed. The position of the nucleus is marked by a dot.

Several such lists are available in the literature (see, e.g.,
[2, 4, 5, 9]), but no comprehensive ordering scheme for
POs in three degrees of freedom has been proposed so far,
and a priori it is not even clear if one exists. However,
in Fig. 1 a clear structure underlying the family of POs
becomes apparent: The periods and actions of most POs
fall into well-separated series. (A few orbits that arise
from secondary bifurcations and do not ﬁt this pattern
were omitted from the ﬁgure.) In a recent publication
[41] we argued that the POs arise from the breakup of
invariant tori (i.e., they are N -torus POs in the termi-
nology of Sec. II) and that the series structure provides
evidence for a hierarchical ordering of POs that reﬂects
the hierarchy of invariant tori in an integrable limit of
the dynamics. In the following, we will brieﬂy summa-
rize the conclusions reached in [41], describe in detail the
computational procedures that justify them and demon-
strate how the ordering of POs can be used to gain in-
sight into the topology of higher-dimensional phase space
structures. In the course of the exposition, the nomen-
clature used in Fig. 1 will be made clear.

The three shortest or fundamental periodic orbits
(FPOs) of the crossed-ﬁelds hydrogen atom were found
in [4, 5]. They do not arise from the breakup of a higher-
dimensional torus and therefore represent the 1-torus
POs in the hierarchy. Two of these, labeled S+ and S−
in [5], serve as organizing centers for the entire hierarchy.
Both of them are planar. They are depicted in Fig. 2. For
very low energies, S+ and S− are shaped like Keplerian
ellipses [4]. At the energy levels chosen in this work, S+
maintains this form, whereas S− is strongly deformed as
shown in Fig. 2. In addition, above the ionization thresh-
old the FPO S−, although still stable, is surrounded by
a phase space region of ionizing trajectories [6, 8, 42].

The mechanism that enables the FPOs to organize the
hierarchy of N -torus POs around them can best be illus-
trated if the discussion is temporarily restricted to the ˜x-
˜y plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. This plane
forms an invariant two-dimensional subsystem. Its dy-
namics is therefore accessible to an investigation using
a Poincar´e surface of section such as Fig. 3. The plot
shows the two FPOs S+ and S−, each at the center of an
island of stability. They are surrounded by POs of larger
periods. In an obvious way, the latter can be thought of
as arising from the breakup of resonant invariant tori and
being interleaved with surviving KAM tori as described

III. ORGANIZATION OF PERIODIC ORBITS

Our investigation of the POs in the crossed-ﬁelds hy-
drogen atom starts with a numerical search for periodic
orbits. This search, which is described in detail in Ap-
pendix A, produces a long and unstructured list of POs.

more generally to characterize the relationship between
the N -torus POs at diﬀerent levels of the hierarchy.

of 2-torus POs and a family T p,n

The entire hierarchy of POs that will be reconstructed
with the help of these criteria is illustrated in Fig. 4. We
distinguish between two families T p and T n of N -torus
POs that appear as series with positive (p) or negative
(n) slope, respectively, in Fig. 1. Each of these contains
a family T p,n
of 3-torus
POs. Since POs which are remnants of the same torus
have nearly identical scaled actions ˜S and periods ˜T , each
point in Fig. 1 represents one speciﬁc broken torus. The
FPOs S+ and S−serve as organizing centers for both
families T p
2 of 2-torus POs. The POs located in
the ˜x-˜y symmetry plane (and shown in Fig. 3) form the
family T p
2 . The 2-torus POs themselves are found to be
limiting cases of two families T p
3 of 3-torus POs.
To justify this description of the hierarchy, it is nec-
essary to assign winding numbers to individual POs and
calculate the corresponding action variables, so that the
three criteria can be applied. These calculations will be
presented in Sec. IV and V. It will also be shown that
the freedom of choice in the deﬁnition of action-angle co-
ordinate systems that was explained in Sec. II and that
at ﬁrst sight seems to impede the application of the crite-
ria can in fact be used to assign winding numbers to each
torus in the coordinate system that is best adapted to the
local dynamics. The way how diﬀerent local coordinate
systems transform into one another then contains global
information about the topology of the families of invari-
ant tori that is represented by the topological invariants
M p and M n in Fig. 4.

in the previous section. Therefore, the POs can be la-
beled with winding numbers and action variables that
stem from the original family of invariant tori, and thus
provide access also to the distribution of the remaining
invariant tori, which are much harder to compute.

An integrable Hamiltonian system with f > 2 degrees
of freedom possesses an entire hierarchy of invariant tori
of dimensions up to f . In every dimension the fully res-
onant tori break up into isolated POs. A generic higher-
dimensional Hamiltonian system will therefore exhibit a
hierarchy of N -torus POs, where at each level the family
of N -torus POs is organized by the underlying family of
(N − 1)-torus POs. This scenario is entirely analogous
to the simple two-dimensional example of Fig. 3, but be-
yond two degrees of freedom we cannot rely on Poincar´e
surface of section plots to diagnose the situation.

In Fig. 1 all series end at lines that are formed by
the FPOs and their repetitions. This observation gives
us a ﬁrst hint that the FPOs indeed serve as organizing
centers for the families of longer POs even in the full,
three-dimensional dynamics. This hint, however, is weak,
and it is desirable to characterize the relation between the
FPOs and the families they organize in a more detailed
way.

±

In Ref. [41], we proposed three quantitative criteria to
1 of the FPOs S±
this end: (i) The stability angles φ
(i.e. the phase angles of the unimodular eigenvalues of
their stability matrices) describe the rotation that each
FPO imposes upon its neighborhood. The winding ratios
±
of the 2-torus POs converge toward φ
1 /2π as the FPOs
are approached. (ii) In the same limit, the action variable
corresponding to the degree of freedom along the FPO
converges to the action of the FPO, and (iii) the action
variable for the motion transverse to the FPO, which is
given by the area the (original) invariant torus encloses
in the Poincar plane, tends to zero. We will use these
criteria, which are derived in a two-dimensional setting,

yields the ﬁrst winding number w1. Counting the POs
within one series from bottom to top yields the second
winding number w2. The ﬁrst series must be assigned
w1 = 1 because the repetitions of the orbits in the left-
most series occur in all higher series and the k-fold repeti-
tion of a PO results in another PO with winding numbers
multiplied by k compared to the primitive PO.

Using the same multiplication principle, we can per-
form a ﬁrst consistency check on this numbering scheme
because it allows us to derive a pattern for the values
of w2 across diﬀerent series. All POs in the ﬁrst series
are obviously primitive, whereas in higher series primi-
tive and repeated POs are interleaved. As illustrated in
Fig. 5, the winding numbers of all orbits in the higher
series can be deduced from those of the ﬁrst series. The
numerical results shown in Fig. 6 conﬁrm this pattern.
Only the base value w0
2 to be assigned to the PO with
the lowest action in the ﬁrst series remains undetermined
from these considerations. It will turn out that w0
2 can-
not be determined uniquely. Instead, diﬀerent subsets of
POs suggest diﬀerent values of the winding number w2.
As will be explained below, this non-uniqueness reﬂects
the freedom of choice of diﬀerent action-angle coordinate
systems and allows one to assign winding numbers to
each torus in the coordinate system that is best adapted
to the local dynamics.
To determine w0

2 we use a Fourier series expansion of
the time series of the Cartesian coordinates, with the
frequencies ˜ω measured in units of the fundamental fre-
quency ˜ω0 = 2π/ ˜T . For a PO with period ˜T , these
Fourier spectra do not show peaks at all multiples of the

Figure 5: The pattern of primitive and repeated POs for the
ﬁrst four series of 2-torus POs derived theoretically. The ﬁrst
series w1 = 1 contains only primitive POs. The second series
w1 = 2 shows an alternating sequence of primitive POs (odd
w2) and repetitions of the POs in the ﬁrst series (even w2).
(It cannot be derived from the multiplication principle if there
is an additional primitive PO at the lower or upper end of
the second series.)
In the third series there are blocks of
two primitive POs (w2 indivisible by 3) separated by 3-fold
repetitions of the ﬁrst series POs (w2 divisible by 3). The
fourth series contains primitive POs for odd values of w2, 4-
fold repetitions of the ﬁrst series for positions with w2 divisible
by 4 and 2-fold repetitions of the second series for w2 divisible
by 2 but not by 4. The scheme can be extended to arbitrarily
large values of w1.

fundamental frequency, but only at those that correspond
to the winding numbers and some of their integer linear
combinations [37]. For the planar T p
2 family it suﬃces
to consider ˜x(˜t), since the spectra for ˜y(˜t) show peaks at
identical positions. The ﬁrst peak at ˜ω = 1 · ˜ω0 in the
example of Fig. 7 corresponds to the series number w1
of the POs. It is found in the same position for any PO
in a given series. The second major peak corresponds
to the second winding number w2. Fig. 7(a) shows the
spectrum for the PO with the lowest action in the ﬁrst
series, where this second peak is located at ˜ω = 2 · ˜ω0.

We can therefore set w0

2 = 2, which according to Fig. 5
determines the values of w2 for all orbits. However, as

and POs from the third and fourth series in blue squares and
black triangles, respectively. The sequence of primitive and
repeated POs within the individual series should be compared
to the pattern shown in Fig. 5, which was derived from the
multiplication principle. The numerical results agree perfectly
with the theoretical predictions.

in conﬁguration space and the position of the nucleus.

Fig. 7(b) and (c) show, the peak corresponding to this
value of w2 is not always dominant and can indeed be
very weak if w2 is large. Instead, a strong peak arises at
a diﬀerent position and suggests choosing a diﬀerent set
of winding numbers that has w0′
2 = 4 and is connected to
the previous system by the transformation

way, the two FPOs that bound the T p
2 family impose two
diﬀerent systems of angle coordinates θ and θ′ on the
tori in their neighborhood. The transformation between
the two coordinate systems is a topological invariant that
characterizes the family of 2-torus POs. In our case, it is
given by Eq. (9) and characterized by the matrix

M p =

1 0

.

Both choices are equally viable. They correspond to dif-
ferent choices of angle coordinates on the original tori.
As the Fourier spectra illustrate, the “unprimed” coor-
dinate system is well adapted to the dynamics of orbits
with low values of w2, whereas the “primed” coordinates
describe the dynamics of orbits with high w2.

In view of Fig. 1 (a) it is evident that POs with low
w2 lie close to S−, while POs with high w2 are close to
S+. The transition indicates that the dominant modes
of the dynamics change from one end of the series to the
other: close to S−, these normal modes are the motion
parallel and transverse to the FPO. As the distance from
S− grows, the coupling of the normal modes increases,
and as S+ is approached, the normal modes imposed by
that FPO, which are diﬀerent, gain dominance. In this

As anticipated in Sec. II, M p is an integer matrix with
unit determinant.

Using a similar method, one can assign winding num-
bers to the POs of the T n
2 family. These POs are not
restricted to the x-y symmetry plane, they are truly
three-dimensional in Cartesian coordinate space, so that
a Poincar´e surface of section plot similar to Fig. 3 can-
not be obtained. Nevertheless, the Fourier spectra of ˜x(˜t)
and ˜z(˜t) provide the information needed for a complete
assignment of winding numbers, as shown in Fig. 8. It is
again found that the dominant normal modes are diﬀer-
ent for POs at the lower end of the series, close to S−, and
at the upper end of the series, close to S+. The invariant
M n = M p that characterizes the transition between the
two limits takes the same value for both families.

B. The 3-torus POs T p

3 and T n

Apart from the 2-torus POs, Fig. 1 (b) and (c) show
POs that are generated in the destruction of 3-tori. They
are arranged in the same series as the 2-torus POs, and
each 3-torus PO is intimately related to a 2-torus “part-
ner” with almost identical period and action. Such part-
ners have identical winding numbers w1 and w2, but 3-
torus POs possess a third winding number w3, which
distinguishes diﬀerent 3-torus PO partners of the same
2-torus PO. It manifests itself in an additional peak in
the Fourier spectra and can therefore be assigned by a
straightforward extension of the technique used to clas-
sify the 2-torus POs. For the T n
3 as in Fig. 9 (a) and
(b) the situation is unambiguous since there is only one
strong additional peak. The location of this peak pro-
vides the winding number w3. For POs of the T p
3 family
(see Fig. 9 (c) and (d)), however, two additional peaks of
comparable magnitude arise, giving us two possibilities
to assign the third winding number. In Fig. 9 (d), the two
possibilities are w3 = 5 and w′
3 = 1. As for the 2-torus
POs, the two systems of winding numbers correspond to
diﬀerent angle coordinate systems on the original tori. In
our case, the transformation between the two systems is
given by:

w′

3 = w1 − w3.

(11)

Note that there is no obvious relation between the
classiﬁcation by winding numbers that becomes possible
though the present analysis and the geometrical appear-
ance of the POs in conﬁguration space.

C. The stability of the POs

The stability of a PO in a Hamiltonian system with
three degrees of freedom is characterized by a 4 × 4 sym-
plectic stability matrix, which describes the linearized
dynamics transverse to the PO [32, 40, 43]. Because the
stability matrix is real and symplectic, with each eigen-
value λ its inverse 1/λ and its complex conjugate λ∗ must
also be eigenvalues. Therefore, if the eigenvalues of the
stability matrix are diﬀerent from ±1, they must belong
to either (i) an elliptic pair e±iϕ of complex conjugate
eigenvalues with unit modulus, (ii) a hyperbolic pair λ,
1/λ of real eigenvalues, or (iii) a loxodromic quartet λ,
1/λ, λ∗, 1/λ∗ of complex eigenvalues. A PO is stable
if and only if all eigenvalues of its stability matrix have
unit modulus.

On an N -dimensional resonant torus in an integrable
system, POs occur in continuous N -parameter families.
They therefore have marginal stability, i.e., all four eigen-
values of their stability matrix equal one.
In a non-
integrable system only a small number of isolated POs
remains. The eigenvalues of their stability matrix occur
in elliptic (e) or hyperbolic (h) pairs.
In our numeri-
cal studies we did not ﬁnd any loxodromic quartets for

N -torus POs. In some cases our search algorithm ﬁnds
a large number of POs all of which originate from the
breakup of the same torus and have almost marginal sta-
bility. In these cases, the splitting of the original torus
is so small that we cannot resolve isolated POs within
the given numerical precision. In the other cases, when-
ever our numerical PO search allows us to identify all
members in a quadruplet resulting from the breakup of
a 3-torus, we ﬁnd that it contains all four stability com-
binations ee, eh, he and hh, in accordance with [40].

The 2-torus POs occur as doublets, of which Fig. 10
shows an example. One pair of stability eigenvalues is
approximately the same for both members of a doublet.
It corresponds to the motion transverse to the original

.

(cid:18)

To calculate the action variables ˜I numerically we select
three POs close to each other in the (w1/w2, w3/w2)
plane, so that the action variables are approximately con-
stant in the small triangular area in between. Under this
assumption, we obtain a system of equations

˜S(2) = w(2)
˜S(3) = w(3)

which can be solved for ˜I1, ˜I2, and ˜I3. These values are
then assigned to be the function values at the barycenter
of the triangle. The process is repeated for all POs in the
corresponding family and the results are used to calcu-
late an interpolation function using a modiﬁed Shepard’s
method [44].

2 and T n

2 and T n

For the 2-torus POs we follow a similar procedure, ex-
cept that we need to consider only a single winding ratio
w1/w2. At the energy ˜E = −1.5, we thus obtain the
results shown in Fig. 11 (a), which also displays the ac-
tions and stability angles φ1,2 of the FPOs. The limiting
values for high frequency ratios of the T p
2 fami-
lies coincide with φ1/2π and φ2/2π of S−, respectively.
At the same time, the action variable ˜I2 converges to-
ward the action of the FPO S−, whereas the action vari-
able ˜I1 vanishes. According to the three criteria listed
in Sec. III, we can thus conclude that S− serves as an
organizing center for both families T p
2 and that
the action variable ˜I2 and ˜I1 correspond to the normal
modes along and transverse to S−. (Notice that in three
degrees of freedom a stable FPO has two pairs of unimod-
ular stability eigenvalues, so that the collapse scenario of
Fig. 3 can take place in two transverse degrees of free-
dom independently, giving rise to two families of 2-torus
POs.) For the planar family T p
2 , this result merely con-
ﬁrms the conclusion that we could already draw from the
Poincar´e surface of section plot in Fig. 3. By contrast,
the family T n
2 , although it consists of 2-torus POs, is not
contained in any two-dimensional subsystem that could
be described without an intimate study of the dynamics.
Its analysis is therefore beyond the reach of a Poincar´e
plot. Nevertheless, 11(a) demonstrates that the relations
2 to the FPO S− are entirely
of the families T p
analogous and that S− organizes T n
2 just as much as T p
2 .
As described in Sec. IV A, the winding numbers w used
in Fig. 11 (a) are ill-suited to describe the approach to
S+, and the winding numbers w′ given by (9) should be
used instead. Indeed, none of the actions ˜I1 and ˜I2 tends
to zero in the limit of low frequency ratios. Nevertheless,
S+ can be located in Fig. 11 (a) if its stability angles φ′,
which naturally arise in the w′ system, are transformed
to the w system just as if they were regular frequency

torus one partner is elliptic while the other is hyperbolic
in accordance with the situation of the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ
theorem [39] in two degrees-of-freedom. Figs. 7, 8, 9 show
elliptic (e) POs for the T2 and completely elliptic (ee) for
the T3 in those cases where isolated POs can be identiﬁed.

D. Symmetry considerations

The Hamiltonian (1) possesses three discrete symme-
tries, namely the reﬂection symmetry with respect to the
x-y plane (z-parity), the y-parity with additional time re-
versal and the combination of both. Due to the z-parity,
the x-y plane constitutes a two-degree-of-freedom sub-
system. Any PO outside this plane must either be itself
invariant under the symmetry transformation or possess
a partner related to it via the symmetry transformation.
We ﬁnd the following connection between winding
numbers and symmetry: A PO in the T p
3 family is sym-
metric under the z-parity transformation if and only if
its winding numbers w1 and w2 are even. In the T n
2 and
T n
3 families, the POs with w1 odd and w2 even are sym-
metric under z-parity, while all others are not. For both
families of 3-torus POs the third winding number w3 has
no inﬂuence on the symmetry properties.

V. CALCULATION OF ACTION VARIABLES

In this section we compute the scaled action variables

˜I for each family of POs.

the individual actions ˜I:

The total action of a PO can be expressed in terms of

For any multiple α of the PO, this becomes:

˜S = w · ˜I (w) .

α ˜S = αw · ˜I (αw) ,

(12)

(13)

with the same action variables ˜I(αw) = ˜I(w)as before.
Thus, the ˜I for the T3 families can be written as functions
of any two frequency ratios (which by virtue of Eq. (5)

The transformed stability angles φ in Fig. 11 (a)
demonstrate that the T p,n
emanate from S+ just as they
emanate from S− in the limit of high winding ratios.
This result can be illustrated more clearly if the actions
are calculated in the w′ coordinate system, as shown in
Fig. 11(b). Here, the situation around the FPOs reverses:
˜I ′
1 tends to zero as S+ is approached and remains ﬁnite
in the vicinity of S−. (Note that by virtue of Eq. (7)
there can exist coordinate systems in which the action
variables take negative values.) In Fig. 11(b), the true
stability angles of S+ can be used to indicate the lower
limits of the winding ratios, whereas the stability angles
of S− need to be transformed with the inverse of Eq. (17).
This symmetry demonstrates that locally the collapse
onto S+ and S− looks the same when de-
of the T p,n
scribed in suitable local coordinates. The nontrivial
topology of the families T p
2 that is represented
by the invariants M p,n becomes visible only if the en-
tire families, including both limiting FPOs, are studied,
cf. Fig. 4.

Fig. 11 (c) and (d) shows the situation at ˜E = −1.4
and ˜F = 0.5, above the ionization saddle point. Here S−
is surrounded by an area ﬁlled with ionizing trajectories
[6, 8, 42]. This ionizing region prevents the T p,n
from
collapsing onto S−. Yet, they still emanate from S+.

2

Fig. 12 (a) shows the frequency ratios of 2- and 3-torus
POs. For the 2-torus POs, the missing ratio ˜ω3/˜ω2 is re-
placed with the stability angle that describes the dynam-
ics transverse to the original torus, normalized by 2πw2.
For the FPOs this angle is given by φ1 − φ2. The sur-
roundings of a long stable PO can rotate multiple times
around the PO during one period. Stability angles, how-
ever, can be calculated only modulo 2π. Therefore an
integer number of 2π needs to be added to the stability
angles of long POs. These stability angles arise in the
w′
3 coordinate system and thus need to be transformed
with the inverse of Eq. (11). From Fig. 12 (a) it becomes
apparent that the T3 approach the T2 in a suitable limit
just as the T2 approach the FPOs.

Frequency maps such as Fig. 12(b) have been found in,
e.g., [19, 45] to capture the essential dynamics of a multi-
dimensional system. Their most prominent features are
the resonance lines, each of which is given by a resonance
condition of the form

f

Xi=1

mi ˜ωi = 0

(18)

with integer coeﬃcients mi. Their signiﬁcance arises
from the fact they they represent cantori that act as
partial barriers to phase space transport. Diﬀusive tra-
jectories such as those used in [19, 45] will stick to the
cantori for a long time before leaving their neighborhood
and thereby cause the prominence of the corresponding
resonance lines in the frequency map.

The periodic orbits shown in Fig. 12 are the remnants
of fully resonant tori, on which f − 1 independent res-
onance conditions of the form (18) are satisﬁed. (They
can be derived from the condition (5)). 3-torus POs,
therefore, will be located at the intersections of two res-
onance lines in the frequency map. Since POs are non-
wandering, they belong to the rigid background through
which the diﬀusion of generic trajectories takes place [10].
As Fig. 12 clearly shows, the set of POs presents the web
of dominant resonances just as clearly as the set of diﬀu-
sive trajectories that is customarily used.

The three action variables that characterize the 3-torus
POs are displayed in Fig. 13 for the T p
3 family as func-
tions of the two independent frequency ratios ˜ω1/˜ω2 and
˜ω3/˜ω2. They were calculated from Eq. (15) as described
above. The action variables ˜I1 and ˜I2 obtained from the
3-torus POs converge towards those found for the 2-torus
POs, while ˜I3 tends to zero as the lower boundary is ap-
proached. We thus ﬁnd all three criteria of Sec. III sat-
isﬁed in this higher-dimensional situation: The tranverse
frequency ratio ˜ω3/˜ω2 of the T p
3 tends to the transverse
stability angle of the T p
2 , the longitudinal action variables
˜I1 and ˜I2 of the 3-tori approach those of the 2-tori, and

the transverse action variable ˜I3 vanishes. We can there-
fore conclude that the T p
2 family serves as an organizing
center for the T p
3 , and we can identify the degree of free-
dom corresponding to ˜I3 as being transverse to the family
of 2-tori. Similar results can be obtained for the collapse
of the T n

for all relations depicted in Fig. 4.

Because of these relations, additional data points at
the lower boundary in Fig. 13 can be obtained from the
T p
2 (and are included in the ﬁgure). For these, the missing
frequency ratio ˜ω3/˜ω2 is replaced with the stability angle
according to Fig. 12, the action variables ˜I1 and ˜I2 are
taken from Fig. 11, and ˜I3 is zero.

VI. TORUS QUANTIZATION

The action variables calculated in the preceding para-
graph provide the basis for an Einstein-Brillouin-Keller
(EBK) torus quantization of the hydrogen atom in
crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The way of record-
ing a quantum spectrum that is best suited to semiclassi-
cal investigations of atomic spectra is scaled-energy spec-
troscopy, which has for that reason been used in most
experimental and theoretical work [2, 7, 46]. It oﬀers the
advantage that the underlying classical dynamics does
not change across the spectrum. A scaled spectrum con-
sists of those values of the scaling parameter B−1/3 that
characterize the quantum states for given scaled energy
˜E and scaled electric ﬁeld strength ˜F .

The phase space volume ﬁlled by 3-torus POs from the
T p
3 family is considerably larger than the volume ﬁlled by
T n
3 , as can be seen by the number of respective POs for
example in Fig. 1. Thus, the largest part of the spectrum
is also obtained from the quantization of the actions be-
longing to T p
3 .

The EBK quantization condition reads [25, 26, 27, 28,

where the γi are the fundamental loops on the torus used
in the deﬁnition (3) of the action variables, ni are inte-
ger quantum numbers and αi the corresponding Maslov
indices. As shown above, one can obtain the action in-
tegrals from PO data without having to determine the
paths γi. In our case, we calculate the scaled action vari-
ables ˜Ii which need to be rescaled to obtain the true
actions Ii = ˜IiB−1/3. Thus, the quantization condition

reads, with ~ = 1 in atomic units:

˜Ii (cid:18)

B−1/3 = 2π

(cid:16)

.

(20)

We derive the Maslov indices αi from two simple con-
siderations: In the limit of small ˜I1 and ˜I3, the action
variable ˜I2 and its conjugate angle correspond to the mo-
tion along the elliptic FPOs, which clearly has rotational
character and requires α2 = 0. The other two modes
are transverse to this fundamental motion and are thus
expected to have vibrational character, which leads to
α1 = α3 = 2.

Inverting Eq. (20) to calculate B1/3 gives:

A quantization condition for the scaled spectrum is ob-
tained by observing that B−1/3 must take the same value
for all three degrees of freedom. We can thus calculate
the frequency ratios corresponding to the state with given
quantum numbers n1, n2, n3 from the following set of

Fig. 14 shows the EBK spectrum obtained from the
quantization of the T p

with the semiclassical quantum numbers (n1, n2, n3).
The manifolds of constant n2, corresponding to the quan-
tization of ˜I2, determine the principal series discernible
in the spectrum. The n2-manifolds overlap for n2 > 4.
For given n2, n1 ranges from 0 to 2n2 − 2, giving a total
number of 2n2 −1 subseries. The number of states within
one subseries is n2 − Int
. Subseries are identiﬁed by
a constant value of n1 + n3. The states within one sub-
(cid:3)
series are labeled by n3, beginning with 0 for the highest
state.

Fig. 14 demonstrates that the spectrum derived from
the quantization of the T p
3 is in very good agreement
with the exact quantum spectrum obtained as in, e.g.,
[12, 46, 47]. The energy levels can be characterized in
terms of three quantum numbers n, q, k, which were
ﬁrst introduced in perturbation theory [48]: The princi-
pal quantum number n identiﬁes the principal series. The
second quantum number q runs from −(n− 1), . . . , +(n−
1) with increasing energy and corresponds to the sub-
series. Finally, k counts the states within a subseries and
runs from 0 to n − |q| − 1. A line-by-line comparison be-
tween the semiclassical and the exact quantum spectrum

as in Table I yields the following correspondence between
the torus quantum numbers n1, n2, n3 and the quantum
numbers n, q, k:

n = n2,
q = (n1 + n3 + 1) − n2,
k = n3.

(24)

Since ˜I2 corresponds to the fastest rotation, it comes as
no surprise that the semiclassical n2 represents the prin-
cipal quantum number n.

3 . These peaks belong to the T n

For large n2, the frequency ratios calculated from
Eqs. (22) and (23) for the lowest peaks in the central
subseries (n1 + n3 ≈ n2) lie outside the frequency range
covered by the T p
3 family.
However, the boundary of frequency ratios, especially in
regions where few POs are available for the calculation
of the action variables, is sometimes not clear-cut, which
leads to a fuzzy boundary between the states of T p
3 and
those of T n
3 . Fig. 15 shows a spectrum for a single sub-
series where the lowest states are taken from the quan-
tization of the T n
3 requires
α1 = 0 and yields a correspondence between torus quan-
tum numbers and traditional quantum numbers that is
diﬀerent from (24). The comparison with the exact quan-
tum spectrum in Fig. 15 shows excellent agreement, with
the exception of the two right-most peaks. These states
lie in a region of the plane of winding ratios where not
many POs are known and the action variables can be
calculated only to correspondingly lower accuracy.

The hydrogen atom in crossed electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds presents long-standing challenges to both the
dynamical-systems and the atomic-physics communities.

of POs. This knowledge provides the basis for the semi-
classical calculation of the atomic spectrum using EBK
quantization. Our results are in good agreement with the
exact quantum mechanical spectrum.

Because the classiﬁcation of POs by winding num-
bers relies only on the existence of a hierarchy of broken
tori, which is a common feature in many non-integrable
Hamiltonian systems, it will be applicable to other chal-
lenging systems.
In particular, previous experience on
the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld [49] has shown
that a semiclassical approximation that is derived in a
near-integrable setting can successfully describe quantum
states even deep in the mixed regular-chaotic regime. It
is therefore to be expected that our quantization scheme
will still be useful at appreciably higher ﬁeld strengths
than were considered here.

Appendix A: THE PERIODIC-ORBIT SEARCH

Due to the Coulomb singularity in the Hamiltonian (1),
a straightforward numerical integration of the trajecto-
ries is unfeasible. To overcome this diﬃculty, we use
the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel regularization [50, 51] and in-
tegrate in four-dimensional position and momentum co-

Figure 15: The quantization of the T n
3 family (blue) gives the
two left-most peaks in the n2 = 10 and n1 + n3 = 10 (n = 10,
q = 1) subseries showing a good agreement with the exact
quantum spectrum (green). The other peaks result from the
quantization of the T p
3 (red). The slight discrepancies of the
peaks on the right are due to numerical inaccuracies in the
interpolation procedure.

In this work we have addressed both issues. From the
viewpoint of dynamical systems we have demonstrated
the power of periodic orbits when they are used as a
probe to the intricacies of the geometrical and dynam-
ical structures in phase space. Being the remnants of
broken tori, periodic orbits can be used to establish a
complete hierarchy of these phase space structures. At
energies slightly below and slightly above the ionization
saddle point of the crossed-ﬁelds hydrogen atom we es-
tablished this hierarchy as follows. Three fundamental
periodic orbits [4] that do not arise from the breakup of
a higher-dimensional torus represent the 1-tori in the hi-
erarchy. Two of them serve as organizing centers for two
families T p
2 of 2-torus POs. The periodic orbits
located in the x-y symmetry plane form the T p
2 family.
The 2-torus POs themselves were found to be limiting
cases of two families T p
3 and T n

3 of 3-torus POs.

Having established the hierarchy of POs, we calculated

ordinates u and p. The equations of motion in KS co-
ordinates with respect to a pseudotime parameter τ are
free of singularities (see, e.g., [47]).

We describe the search for periodic orbits as a root-
ﬁnding problem. A PO is identiﬁed by a starting point
Pi = (u, p)i in phase space and by its pseudotime pe-
riod τ . Given an initial guess for Pi and τ , we calculate
the ﬁnal point Pf of the trajectory by integrating the
equations of motion for a time τ and then use a Newton-
like method to modify Pi (within the energy shell) and
τ so that Pf = Pi. Speciﬁcally, we use a Powell-hybrid
root-ﬁnding method [44] for this task.

The initial guesses required by the root-ﬁnder are ob-

tained as follows: we ﬁx a Poincar´e surface of section
in phase space. Initial guesses for Pi are chosen on an
equidistant grid on this four-dimensional surface. Start-
ing from each of these points, we integrate the equations
of motion until the trajectory returns to the neighbor-
hood of its starting point (or a prescribed maximum pe-
riod is exceeded). The time it takes for the trajectory to
come back close to its starting point serves as the initial
guess for the period τ .

Like any other numerical PO search, this algorithm is
not guaranteed to ﬁnd all POs. It does not require any
prior knowledge of the dynamics, which we extract from
the POs a posteriori, even if the data set is incomplete.

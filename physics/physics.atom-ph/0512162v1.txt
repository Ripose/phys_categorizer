Abstract

In this paper we use a zero-range potential (ZRP) method to model positron interac-
tion with molecules. This allows us to investigate the eﬀect of molecular vibrations
on positron-molecule annihilation using the van der Waals dimer Kr2 as an example.
We also use the ZRP to explore positron binding to polyatomics and examine the
dependence of the binding energy on the size of the molecule for alkanes. We ﬁnd
that a second bound state appears for a molecule with ten carbons, similar to recent
experimental evidence for such a state emerging in alkanes with twelve carbons.

1 Introduction

The main aim of this work is to achieve better understanding of large anni-
hilation rates observed for many polyatomic molecules [1,2,3,4]. In particular,
we use an exactly solvable model to verify the prediction [5,6] that positron
capture into vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR) gives rise to a strong
enhancement of the annihilation rate. We also use this model to investigate
the dependence of positron binding energy for polyatomics on the size of the
molecule. Such binding was postulated in [5,6] as a necessary condition for
VFRs.

The annihilation rate for positrons in a gas of atoms or molecules can be
expressed in terms of an eﬀective number of electrons, Zeﬀ, by

λ = πr 2

0cZeﬀn,

(1)

where r0 is the classical electron radius, c is the speed of light and n is the
number density of the gas. Measurements by Paul and Saint-Pierre in the
early sixties [1] indicated unusually large positron annihilation rates in cer-
tain polyatomic molecular gases, with Zeﬀ exceeding the actual number of
electrons by orders of magnitude. They speculated that this might be caused
by the formation of positron-molecule bound states, and later Smith and Paul
[7] explored the possibility that the large rates might be caused by a vibra-
tional resonance. Research on the alkanes and similar molecules since that
time [2,3,4] uncovered a rapid growth of Zeﬀ with the size of the molecule and
very strong chemical sensitivity of Zeﬀ. However, only recently a verisimilar
physical picture of this phenomenon has begun to emerge [5,6,8]. These pa-
pers put forward a mechanism which is operational for molecules with positive
positron aﬃnities, and which involves capture of positrons into VFRs.

Recent measurements of annihilation with a positron beam at high resolu-
tion (25 meV) [9,10], have shown resonances in the energy dependence of the
annihilation rate parameter, Zeﬀ, of alkane molecules. Most of the features ob-
served have been unambiguously identiﬁed as related to molecular vibrations.
In particular, for all alkanes heavier than methane Zeﬀ displays a prominent
C–H stretch vibrational peak. The experiments found that the magnitude of
Zeﬀ in the peak increases rapidly with the size of the molecule (similarly to
the increase in Zeﬀ observed with thermal room-temperature positrons [2,3,4]).
Another remarkable ﬁnding concerns the position of the C–H peak. While for
ethane its energy is close to the mode energy of C–H stretch vibrations (0.37
eV), for heavier alkanes the resonances appear at an energy ∼ 20 meV lower
for each carbon added. This downward shift provides evidence of positron
binding to molecules. The binding energies observed increase from about 14
meV in C3H8 to 205 meV in C12H26. Very recent experiments show evidence
of a second bound state for alkanes with 12 and 14 carbons [11].

So far, realistic molecular calculations have not been able to reproduce en-
hanced Zeﬀ. For hydrocarbons and a number of other polyatomics, calcula-
tions have been done using a model positron-molecule correlation potential
in a ﬁxed nuclei approximation [12,13]. Such calculations often provide a rea-
sonable description of low-energy positron-molecule scattering. However, their
results, almost without exception, underestimate experimental Zeﬀ, in some
cases by an order of magnitude. This suggests that to describe enhanced Zeﬀ,
dynamical coupling to molecular vibrations must be included. Such coupling
was considered earlier for diatomics and CO2 [14,15], where it had a relatively
small eﬀect on Zeﬀ. (These molecules most likely do not form bound states

2

with the positron, and do not possess VFR.) Calculations by the Schwinger
multichannel method [16], which treats electron-positron correlations ab initio
for ﬁxed nuclei, also underestimate Zeﬀ for molecules such as C2H4 [17] and
C2H2 [18] by an order of magnitude [19].

To examine the eﬀect of vibrations on positron scattering and annihilation,
we consider a simple model of Kr2 dimer using the zero-range potential (ZRP)
method [20]. In this model the interaction of the positron with each of the
atoms is parametrised using the atomic value of the scattering length. It is
applicable at low energies when the de Broglie wavelength of the projectile
is much larger than the typical size of the scatterers. Once ZRP is adopted,
the problem of the positron-molecule interaction, including the vibrational
dynamics, can be solved practically exactly. In the previous paper [21] the
interaction between the atoms in the dimer was treated using the harmonic
approximation (HA), which allowed the vibrational coupling matrix elements
to be calculated analytically. A parabolic potential does not describe well the
shallow asymmetric interatomic potential for a weakly bound van der Waals
molecule such as Kr2. In this work we use the Morse potential to provide a
better description of the molecular interaction. It is a good approximation
to the best potential available for Kr2 [22]. We examine how the use of a
realistic molecular potential aﬀects the positions and magnitudes of the VFR.
To explore positron binding to polyatomics we again use the ZRP method.
Speciﬁcally, we model alkanes by representing the CH2 and CH3 groups by
ZRPs. We investigate the dependence of the binding energy on the number
of monomers and ﬁnd that a second bound state emerges for a molecule with
ten carbons.

2 Zero-range model for a molecular dimer

In a van der Waals molecule the atoms are far apart and are only weakly
perturbed by each other. This makes it an ideal system for applying the ZRP
method. In this work we model the interaction between the two Kr atoms
using the Morse potential (MP),

U(R) = Umin[e−2α(R−R0) − 2e−α(R−R0)],

(2)

with the parameters R0 = 7.56 a.u., Umin = 6.32 × 10−4 a.u. = 17.2 meV, and
ω = (2Uminα2/m)1/2 = 1.1 × 10−4 a.u. = 2.99 meV [23,24], where m is the
reduced mass of Kr2. The energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the MP
are given by simple analytical formulae [25]. In Fig. 1 we compare the Morse

Fig. 1. Comparison of the best Kr2 potential (solid curve) with the Morse potential
(dashed curve) and harmonic approximation (dotted curve). Chain curve is the
adiabatic potential for the e+Kr2.

Figure 1 shows that the Morse potential is close to the best Kr2 potential,
while the HA is valid only in the vicinity of the minimum. This conclusion
is supported by the comparison of the vibrational spacings. For the MP we
have ω10 ≡ E1 − E0 = 2.74 meV, ω21 = 2.47 meV, ω32 = 2.21 meV, which
agree well with ω10 = 2.65 meV, ω21 = 2.39 meV, ω32 = 2.12 meV for the Kr2
potential [22]. Both potentials are strongly anharmonic, with ωn+1,n deviating
markedly from ω = 2.99 meV of HA. Obviously, the MP is a much better
approximation than HA for modelling the Kr2 potential.

In the ZRP model the interaction between a positron and an atom is expressed
as a boundary condition for the positron wavefunction ψ,

calculations yield κ0 = −0.1 a.u. [27,28,29]. When applied to a two-centre

where r is the positron coordinate, and Ri (i = 1, 2) are the coordinates of

where k0 is the incident positron momentum, Φn is the nth vibrational state
of the molecule (n = 0, 1, . . . ), and R = R1 − R2 is the interatomic distance.
Equation (7) is written for the case when the positron collides with a ground-
state molecule. The coeﬃcients An and Bn determine the excitation amplitude

where Z (0)
eﬀ is the positron-atom Zeﬀ at k = 0 (see [21] for details). For Kr we
use Z (0)
eﬀ = 81.6 [27]. Equations (8)–(9) also allow one to determine the energies
of bound states of the positron-dimer system, by looking for the poles of An
and Bn at negative projectile energies, i.e., for imaginary positron momenta
k0 = i|k0|.

For doing numerical calculations, the set of equations (8)–(9) can be truncated
by assuming that An = Bn = 0 for n > Nc. This means that only the ﬁrst
Nc + 1 channels with n = 0, 1, . . . , Nc are taken into consideration. At low
projectile energies only a small number of channels are open, and one obtains
converged results with a relatively small Nc. In the calculations we used Nc =
15 and 10, for the HA and MP, respectively. This value for MP is the total
number of bound excited states.

In the single-channel approximation, Nc = 0, the HA results practically coin-
cide with those of the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation, since the matrix elements
(10) and (11) become e±ik0·nR0/2 and eikmR0/R0, respectively (neglecting the
2nd-order and higher corrections in the small parameter k0(mω)−1/2 [21]). A
similar calculation for MP produces slightly diﬀerent results, because of the
asymmetry of the vibrational ground-state wavefunction, which gives rise to
ﬁrst-order corrections to these matrix elements.

3 Results for Kr2

Table 1 shows the values of the bound states (negative) and the VFRs (pos-
itive) of the e+Kr2 complex obtained with MP and in HA. In the Nc = 0
approximation the binding energies are ε0 = −3.77 meV and ε0 = −3.48 meV
for HA and MP, respectively. The binding energy for the MP is smaller due
to the asymmetry of the potential curve. The corresponding energies obtained
from a multichannel calculation given in Table 1 are lower, because allowing
the nuclei to move leads to stabilisation of the e+Kr2 complex.

The ground-state energy of the complex can also be compared to the results
of an adiabatic calculation. For ﬁxed nuclei the energy of the positron bound
state is −κ2/2, where κ is a positive root of the equation κ = κ0 + e−κR/R.
Adding this energy to the Kr2 potential, one obtains the adiabatic potential
for the e+Kr2 complex (chain curve in Fig. 1). Its minimum is about 3.94 meV
below that of the Kr2, which is close to the MP value of ε0 in table 1.

The ﬁrst vibrational excitation energy of the e+Kr2 complex, ω′
10 = ε1 −ε0, for
MP is 3.15 meV, while in HA it is 2.82 meV. Thus, MP calculations predict a
“stiﬀening” of the vibrational motion of the complex in comparison with that
of Kr2. This eﬀect is caused by a shift of the equilibrium position of the atoms
to the left (see Fig. 1), towards the steep repulsive part of the interatomic
potential. Note that in MP, the 2nd bound state with ε1 = −0.74 meV lies
just below the threshold. We will see that this causes a steep rise in σ0→0 and
Zeﬀ as k → 0. In HA this bound state is lower, i.e., further away from threshold,
and its eﬀect on the cross sections is less noticeable. This combination of a
lower binding energy and a greater vibrational frequency in MP, means that
the ﬁrst resonance observed in the cross sections and in Zeﬀ will be at a greater
energy than in HA.

Figure 2 shows the elastic and vibrational excitation cross sections obtained
from Eq. (12) for MP and in HA. To highlight the eﬀect of resonances, the
elastic scattering cross section has been calculated in both multichannel and
single-channel (Nc = 0) approximations. The single-channel (“ﬁxed nuclei”)
elastic cross sections from the two calculations are quite close. The multichan-
nel cross sections are qualitatively similar, the main diﬀerence being in the
positions and widths of the resonances and energies of the vibrational thresh-
olds. The magnitudes of the σ0→1 and σ0→2 cross sections are greater for MP.
Another noticeable diﬀerence is in the rise of σ0→0 towards zero positron en-
ergy in MP calculation.

Figure 3 shows the positron annihilation rate (13) obtained with and without
the coupling to the vibrational motion, i.e., from the multichannel and single-
channel calculations. The background (“ﬁxed nuclei”, Nc = 0) Zeﬀ at low
positron momenta is enhanced due to the large positron-Kr2 scattering length.
Such enhancement ﬁrst predicted in Ref. [30], aﬀects both Zeﬀ and the elastic
cross section, which in this case are proportional to each other, Zeﬀ ∼ σel/4π
in atomic units [5,6]. The eﬀect of VFRs on Zeﬀ is much more prominent than
in scattering, with the strongest resonance four orders of magnitude above the
background. The widths of the resonances in MP and HA, are quite diﬀerent,

e.g., Γ = 2.8 µeV (MP) vs. Γ = 16.7 µeV (HA) for the strongest n = 2
resonance. This diﬀerence, also seen in the scattering cross sections (Fig. 2),
means that anharmonicity of the Kr2 potential reduces the coupling between
the incident positron and vibrationally-excited e+Kr2 compound. A possible
explanation for this is that positron binding has only a small eﬀect on the
equilibrium position of the nuclei (as seen from adiabatic potential curve of
e+Kr2 in Fig. 1).

4 ZRP model of positron binding to polyatomics

In positron-molecule collisions VFRs occur when the energy of the incident
positron plus the energy released in positron-molecule binding, equals the en-
ergy of a vibrational excitation of the positron-molecule complex. For weakly
bound positron states the latter should be close to a vibrational excitation
energy of the neutral molecule. Hence, by observing VFRs one can obtain
information on the binding energy. This procedure was applied to electron
scattering from (CO2)N clusters [31]. In this system the redshift of the VFR
was found to increase with the cluster size by about 12 meV per unit. A sim-
ple model of a spherically-symmetric cluster with a constant potential inside
and −αe2/r4 potential outside was able to reproduce the dependence of the
electron binding energy on the cluster size.

In a similar way, the measurements of the energy dependence of Zeﬀ for alka-
nes with a high-resolution positron beam allow one to determine their positron
binding energies [9,10]. In contrast, an accurate ab initio calculation of positron
binding to a polyatomic molecule is probably beyond the capability of present-
day theory. Even for atoms, calculations of positron binding remain a challeng-
ing task because of the need to carefully account for strong electron-positron
and many-electron correlations (see, e.g., [32]).

In this work we have adopted a diﬀerent approach. To examine positron bind-
ing to alkanes, we model the molecule by representing each CH2 or CH3 group

9

by a ZRP centred on the corresponding carbon atom. The wave function of
a bound state decreases as r−1e−κr at large positron-molecule separation r,
where κ2/2 is the binding energy. For weakly bound states this wavefunction
is very diﬀuse (κ ≪ 1 a.u.), which means that the positron moves mostly
far away from the molecule. The actual binding energy is determined by
their interaction at small distances, and the ZRP model is a simple way of
parametrizing such interaction. It allows us to account for the scaling of the
positron-molecule interaction with the number of monomers (to the extent
that the monomers do not have a large eﬀect on each other), and to use a
realistic geometry of the molecule. We will consider two cases, a straight car-
bon chain, Fig. 5 (a), and a “zigzag” carbon chain, Fig. 5 (b), which matches
the actual structure of the molecule, Fig. 5 (c). Unlike the Kr2 model, the κ0
parameter of the ZRP for alkanes is adjusted semiempirically (see below).

Here Rij = |Ri − Rj| is the distance between the ith and jth ZRP.

For modelling alkanes we choose the distance between the neighbouring ZRPs
equal to the length of the C–C bond. All ZRPs are characterised by the same
value of κ0i = −1.5. This value ensures that the molecule with three ZRP
centres (which models propane, C3H8) has a small binding energy, 7 meV for
the straight chain, and 12 meV for the zigzag chain. These values are close to
that inferred from experiment [9,10], where propane is the ﬁrst molecule for
which a downshift of the C–H peak from the corresponding vibrational energy
can be seen [9,10].

10

In Fig. 6 the results of our calculations are compared with the experimental
binding energies. As we move from a straight ZRP chain, Fig. 5 (a), to a
”zigzag” chain, Fig. 5 (b), the binding energy increases. This is expected as
the carbon atoms beyond the nearest neighbour become closer to each another.
The overall dependence of the binding energy on the number of monomers n
predicted by the ZRP model is similar to that of the experimental data, while
the absolute values predicted by our simple theory are within a factor of two
of the measurements. One may also notice that the measured binding energies
increase almost linearly with n, while the calculation shows signs of saturation.
These discrepancies might be related to the fact that the ZRP model disregards
the long-range −αe2/r4 nature of the positron-molecule interaction, which
would restricts its validity to very small binding energies.

and “zigzag” (triangles) ZRP chains. Experimental results (crosses) [9,10] are shown
for comparison.

A remarkable feature of the model calculations is the emergence of a second
bound state for n = 10 in both straight and “zigzag” chains. This prediction
supports the experimental evidence for the second bound state, in the form
of a C–H peak, which re-emerges at 0.37 eV for dodecane (n = 12) [9,10] and
stabilises by about 50 meV for C14H30 [11].

5 Summary and outlook

We have used the Morse potential to model the interaction between the atoms
in the Kr2 dimer. We ﬁnd that the positron binding energies and the positions
and widths of the VFR change compared with the harmonic approximation.
However, the overall picture remains similar, with the lowest VFR enhancing
the Maxwellian-averaged positron annihilation rate by an order of magnitude
to Zeﬀ ∼ 104 at T ∼ 1 meV.

In priniciple, a similar approach could be applied to positron interaction with
other rare-gas dimers and clusters. For Ar and lighter atoms, the positron-
atom attraction is too weak to allow formation of positron bound states and
VFRs. For Xe2, on the contrary, the attraction is much stronger (κ0 ∼ −0.01
[28]). This leads to a much greater positron-dimer binding energy (∼ 40 meV),
which means that many vibrationally excited states of e+Xe2 are bound, and
only those with high n lie above the positron-dimer continuum threshold. The
coupling between these states and the target ground state is extremely weak,
and we have not been able to ﬁnd any VFR for positrons incident on ground-
state Xe2 in our calculations.

A zero-range potential model for positron binding to alkanes yields binding
energies that are in qualitative agreement with experiment. Our calculation
predicts the emergence of the second bound state for a molecule with ten car-
bon atoms. Such a bound state may have already been observed for dodecane
and tetradecane.

Zero-range potential is an exceptionally simple model. The accuracy of our
predictions is of course limited by the nature of the ZRP model. In particular,
ZRPs disregard the long-range character of the positron-target polarization
attraction. This is a reasonable approximation for very weakly bound states,
but as the binding gets stronger, larger errors may be introduced. Given the
diﬃculty of performing ab initio calculations for positron interaction with
polyatomics, one hopes that more sophisticated yet tractable models could
be developed. They should provide a more accurate description of positron-
molecule binding and capture into vibrational Feshbach resonances. One may
then hope to fully explain the dramatic enhancement of the annihilation rates
and their strong chemical sensitivity for polyatomic molecules.

our attention to the experimental evidence for a second positron bound state
for larger alkanes.

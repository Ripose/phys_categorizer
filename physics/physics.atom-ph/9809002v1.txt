Comparison of Recoil-Induced Resonances (RIR) and Collective Atomic Recoil Laser
(CARL)

(September 26, 2013)

The theories of recoil-induced resonances (RIR) [J. Guo, P. R. Berman, B. Dubetsky and G.
Grynberg, Phys. Rev. A 46, 1426 (1992)] and the collective atomic recoil laser (CARL) [ R.
Instrum. Methods A 341, 360 (1994)] are compared. Both
Bonafacio and L. De Salvo, Nucl.
theories can be used to derive expressions for the gain experienced by a probe ﬁeld interacting with
an ensemble of two-level atoms that are simultaneously driven by a pump ﬁeld. It is shown that the
RIR and CARL formalisms are equivalent. Diﬀerences between the RIR and CARL arise because
the theories are typically applied for diﬀerent ranges of the parameters appearing in the theory.
The RIR limit considered in this paper is qP0/M ωq ≫ 1, while the CARL limit is qP0/M ωq <
∼ 1,
where q is the magnitude of the diﬀerence of the wave vectors of the pump and probe ﬁelds, P0 is
the width of the atomic momentum distribution and ωq is a recoil frequency. The probe gain for a
probe-pump detuning equal to zero is analyzed in some detail, in order to understand how the gain
arises in a system which, at ﬁrst glance, might appear to have vanishing gain. Moreover, it is shown
that the calculations, carried out in perturbation theory have a range of applicability beyond the
recoil problem. Experimental possibilities for observing CARL are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been increased interest in spectral features that can attributed directly to the recoil atoms
undergo on the absorption, emission or scattering of radiation. Among topics that have been discussed that fall into
this category are Recoil-Induced Resonances (RIR) [1–9] and the Collective Atomic Recoil Laser (CARL) [10–13].
These processes appear to have much in common, although they are described quite diﬀerently. It is the purpose of
this article to compare the RIR and CARL and to demonstrate that the RIR and CARL formalisms are equivalent.
The reason that this equivalence is not readily apparent is two-fold. Firstly, the RIR have been discussed using a
density matrix approach in the Schr¨odinger picture, whereas CARL has been discussed using an operator approach
in the Heisenberg picture. Secondly, RIR and CARL have generally been examined for diﬀerent ranges of the various
parameters characterizing the atom-ﬁeld interactions. In order to facilitate the discussion, it is useful to review brieﬂy
the RIR and CARL.

Since both the RIR and CARL relate to probe ﬁeld absorption or gain in the presence of a pump ﬁeld, it is perhaps
best to recall the features of the probe absorption spectrum, neglecting all eﬀects associated with recoil. Consider an
ensemble of two-level atoms interacting with both a pump and probe ﬁeld. The probe absorption or gain is monitored
as a function the probe-pump detuning δ for various pump ﬁeld strengths, characterized by the pump ﬁeld Rabi
frequency χ1. It is assumed that all collisional eﬀects can be neglected and that the two-level atomic system is closed
in the sense that the sum of ground and excited state populations is conserved for each velocity subclass of atoms.
Moreover, it is assumed that the pump ﬁeld detuning ∆ from atomic resonance is much larger than any decay rates,
Rabi frequencies, or Doppler shifts in the problem. In this limit, the probe absorption spectrum consists of three
features, centered near δ = 0,

∆ [14].

Of primary concern here is the structure centered near δ = 0. In the absence of recoil, this line feature has a
dispersion-like shape, is proportional to χ4
1, and has a width of order of the excited state decay rate [15]. Its origin can
be traced to an interference eﬀect involving processes in which two photons are emitted into previously unoccupied
vacuum mode states [16]. As such, it is linked to spontaneous emission, rather than a conservative exchange of energy
between the pump and probe ﬁelds. The fact that the two-level system is ”closed” plays a critical role here. Had
the system been ”open,” the amplitude of this component would vary as χ2
1 and its width could be
determined by some eﬀective ground state decay rate (e.g. inverse transit time) rather than the excited state decay
rate [17].

1 rather than χ4

±

The RIR refer to a class of spectroscopic features in nonlinear spectroscopy that can be attributed to a recoil-induced
”opening” of an otherwise closed, two-level system [1]. In the presence of recoil, the atomic velocity is changed on the
absorption or emission of radiation. As a consequence the sum of ground and excited state populations for speciﬁc
velocity classes is no longer conserved. In the limit of large detuning ∆, the RIR can be interpreted as arising from
Raman transitions between diﬀerent center-of-mass states [1]. If the pump and probe ﬁelds have propagation vectors
k1 and k2, respectively, then probe absorption occurs on a Raman transition between center-of-mass momentum

between the probe and pump ﬁelds, one of these processes is favored. For δ < 0, there is probe gain, for δ > 0, there
is probe absorption, and for δ = 0, the nonlinear probe absorption and gain vanish. In general, the RIR have been
formulated as a stationary process in which the ﬁeld achieves a steady-state value at each position R - gain occurs
as the probe ﬁeld propagates through the active medium. Steady state is achieved by assuming that there is some
eﬀective ground state decay rate or, alternatively, by assuming that the Doppler width associated with the Raman
transitions, qP0/M, where M is an atomic mass and P0 is the width of the momentum distribution, is larger than
the recoil frequency, ωq = ¯hq2/2M [6,8,18]. The gain is normally expressed as dE2/dZ = αE2, where E2 is the probe
ﬁeld’s amplitude and α is a constant proportional to the atomic density. The point to note here is that the derivative
of E2 depends locally on E2.

R

In contrast to the RIR, CARL has been formulated as a transient problem. It is assumed that the pump and probe
ﬁelds are modes of an optical cavity in which the atoms are located. As a result of the atom-ﬁeld interaction, the
probe ﬁeld builds up in the cavity as a function of time. In the limit of large ∆, one obtains an equation of the form
t
dE2/dt = β
0 f (t, t′)E2(t′)dt′, where β where is a constant proportional to the atomic density and f is a kernel. If
qP0/M < ωq, the time derivative of E2 can depend on the past history of the ﬁeld, rather than locally on the ﬁeld.
This leads to very diﬀerent dynamics than those encountered in the RIR. One ﬁnds threshold conditions for probe
gain that depend nonlinearly on the atomic density, as does the gain itself. CARL is a cooperative eﬀect in the sense
that gain occurs only for some minimum atomic density for most values of the detuning δ. It is possible to have gain
for δ
ωq, the equation for dE2/dt becomes
local and the gain characteristics of CARL become identical to those of the RIR. Thus, although both the RIR and
CARL can be formulated for arbitrary ratios of qP0/M ωq, one can label the RIR limit as one in which qP0/M
ωq
and the CARL limit as one in which qP0/M <
ωq [19]. This is the nomenclature that is adopted in this article. The
Carl limit can be stated as, 2P0/¯hq <

1, which places it at or near the subrecoil limit of atom cooling. It should be

noted that Verkerk and Bonafacio [11] and Bonafacio et al. [12] have shown that the CARL equations reproduce the

In Sec. II, the basic equations are derived and the RIR and CARL limits of these equations are obtained in Sec.
III. An eﬀective potential for ground state atoms is written which helps to categorize the RIR and CARL limits. The
case of equal pump and probe frequencies is analyzed in Sec. IV using an eﬀective ﬁve-level atom. When expressed
in this form the calculation has a range of applicability beyond the recoil problem. The results are discussed in Sec.
V. Special emphasis is placed on the distinction between ”atom bunching” and ”matter gratings.” Experimental
implications of the results are also explored.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

The problem under consideration consists of a pump ﬁeld and a probe ﬁeld interacting with an ensemble of two
level atoms . In some applications in CARL, it may be of interest to use a quantized description of the ﬁelds to follow
the build-up of the probe ﬁeld from noise, but, in the present discussion, the ﬁelds are taken to be classical. The

much more intense than the probe ﬁeld, as is assumed, pump depletion during the early stages of probe ampliﬁcation
can be neglected. Since the calculation in this paper is limited to the early stages of probe ampliﬁcation, I take the
pump ﬁeld amplitude to be constant, E1(R, t)

E1.

The dynamics of probe ﬁeld ampliﬁcation depends on the speciﬁc atom-ﬁeld geometry. One can envision situations
in which the probe ﬁeld amplitude is constant in time but varies in space, or is constant in space but varies in time.
The ﬁrst case is the one considered generally in the RIR, in which cw pump and probe ﬁelds interact with atoms
in a cell or trap. The probe ﬁeld amplitude increases in the direction of k2 as it propagates through the medium,
but is assumed to have evolved to a stationary state. The second case is the one considered generally in CARL, in
which the ﬁelds correspond to ﬁeld modes of an optical cavity and the atoms are located in the cavity. For a ring
cavity, the probe ﬁeld intensity is spatially isotropic, but increases in time [12]. In certain limits (to be noted below),
the spatial gain coeﬃcient of the RIR multiplied by the speed of light coincides with the temporal gain coeﬃcient of
CARL. In other limits, the dynamics of CARL ampliﬁcation diﬀers from the spatial build-up of the ﬁeld in the RIR.
To compare the RIR and CARL, it is convenient to adopt the cavity model and assume that the probe ﬁeld amplitude
is a function of time only, E2(R, t)

E2(t). All cavity losses are neglected, as is any ground state decay.

Although CARL is referred to as a collective eﬀect since conditions for CARL gain depend on the atomic density,
each atom in the sample, on average, interacts with the ﬁelds in an identical manner. Thus, it is suﬃcient to write
the Hamiltonian for a single atom interacting with the ﬁelds. The dependence of the ﬁeld gain on atomic density is
included automatically in the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. In the dipole and rotating wave approximations, the

The time evolution of the (complex) probe ﬁeld amplitude is linked to the polarization of the medium which, in
turn, is determined by the atom-ﬁeld interaction. The medium’s polarization can be expressed in terms of atomic
density matrix elements as

P(R, t) = N [℘ ρ12(R, t) + ℘∗ ρ21(R, t)] ,

where N is the total number of atoms. As a result of the nonlinear atom-ﬁeld interaction, the density matrix element

can still be carried out using an amplitude picture. The initial condition (21) is invoked once the density matrix

leads to the evolution equation (23) for the ground state amplitude A1(P, t). The second term in the Hamiltonian is
the spatially homogeneous light shift potential and is not of interest here. The third term is the potential formed by
the pump and probe ﬁelds which gives rise to RIR and CARL. The depth of the potential, U = ¯hχ1χ∗2(t)/
, is a

is much larger than U , any ”bunching” or spatial modulation
critical parameter. If the energy spread of the atoms δ
of the atomic density will be negligibly small, independent of the detuning δ. This is generally the case at thermal
energies, making it all but impossible to observe RIR and CARL using atoms in cells at or above the Doppler limit
of laser cooling (see discussion in Sec. V). Assuming that δ
E
is much greater than the level spacings in the potential U , then the motion of the atoms can be treated classically.
By approximating the potential as that of a harmonic oscillator and assuming that the spread ∆P is of order ¯hq,
one can estimate that the validity condition for the motion to be treated classically is
1. This is the
limit considered by Bonifacio and coworkers [10] and will be referred to as CARLSC, with the ”SC” denoting the
semiclassical limit. A theory of CARL in which the atomic motion is fully quantized has been given recently by Moore
and Meystre [13]. It will be referred to as CARLQ, when it is necessary to distinguish between CARLSC and CARLQ.
The theory of RIR has been developed using a quantized description of the center-of-mass motion; consequently, the
RIR and CARLQ theories should produce identical results, and the RIR and CARLSC theories should produce the
1. It should be noted that, although the atomic motion in the optical potential is
same results when
treated classically in CARLSC, the gain in CARLSC results from recoil-induced processes. This point is discussed in
more detail in Sec. V.

In calculating expectation values of operators that are diagonal in the internal states, one can neglect contributions
from the excited state since the excited state population is assumed to be negligibly small. The CARL equations are
derived using the Heisenberg equations of motion while the RIR are derived using a density matrix approach. I now
show that these methods yield equivalent results, as they must.

To make connection with CARL, one deﬁnes a Heisenberg operator, ”bunching parameter,” B(t) = eiq

R(t). Using

Eqs. (14), (25), (21), and (29b), one can write the average value of the bunching parameter as [20]

a shift of the probe ﬁeld frequency. By setting χ2(t) = ˜χ2(t)eiδt in Eqs. (32,33), it is easy to see that the detuning δ

The gain depends linearly on the atomic density and the pump ﬁeld intensity. The gain is positive for δ < 0, negative
(absorption) for δ > 0, and vanishes at δ = 0. This is a ”single particle” gain in that each atom contributes separately
to the gain and there is no threshold condition for gain that depends on atomic density.

As long as the magnitude of the second term is much less than unity, the build-up of the probe ﬁeld depends linearly

An interesting limiting case is one in which W (P)

arising from linear dispersion]. When δ = 0, the probe gain vanishes identically in the RIR limit r
exponentially for CARLSC. For CARLQ, it follows from Eq. (52) that the probe gain is exponential provided that

This qualitative diﬀerence between the RIR and CARL limits is reason enough to consider the δ = 0 case in some
detail, but it is not the only reason. The existence of exponential gain when δ = 0 is surprising at ﬁrst glance. It would
seem that processes in which a pump photon is absorbed and a probe photon emitted would be exactly cancelled by
processes in which a probe photon is absorbed and a pump photon emitted, owing to the symmetry of the interaction
when W (P)
δ(P). It is the purpose of this section to investigate the origin of exponential gain in CARL when
δ = 0. Calculations are carried out in a perturbative limit, that is, to lowest order in the pump ﬁeld intensity. As is
shown below, the results are also applicable to a wider range of problems.

Since decay is neglected, the calculation is most conveniently carried out using state amplitudes rather than density
matrix elements. No ensemble average is needed here since we start in an eigenstate of momentum, P = 0. It is

Of course, the integral equation (67) is equivalent to the coupled equations (34,38) with δ = 0. However, this form of
the equations is convenient for obtaining the early time development of the ﬁeld and for determining the conditions
under which the ﬁeld undergoes exponential gain. By solving Eq. (67) iteratively, one ﬁnds

In summary, the probe gain that occurs for δ = 0 and large ∆ is clearly not a single particle eﬀect. It is more
closely related to a ”propagation” eﬀect in which the phase modulation of the probe ﬁeld produced by the nonlinear
atom-ﬁeld interaction drives the probe gain.

V. DISCUSSION

It has been shown that the density matrix-RIR and Heisenberg operator-CARL formalisms lead to equivalent
equations. The RIR and CARL limits refer simply to diﬀerent regions of parameter space of these equations. For a
given experimental situation, one must determine whether one is in the RIR limit, the CARL limit, or neither limit
(as is most often the case). The experimental implications of the RIR and CARL are discussed below, but ﬁrst I
would like to discuss the distinction between the terms ”matter grating” used in discussions of the RIR and ”atomic
bunching” used in discussions of CARL.

The term ”matter grating” refers to spatially modulated atom distributions resulting from a nonlinear atom-ﬁeld
interaction. The term ”atomic bunching” refers to a redistribution or focusing of atoms in an optical potential. For
the RIR and CARL, these terms are synonymous. If recoil eﬀects are neglected, that is, if the center-of-mass motion is
treated classically from the outset, the total atomic density is conserved for each velocity subclass of atoms (neglecting
collisions). A homogeneous atomic density remains homogeneous to all orders in the atom-ﬁeld interaction. Recoil

13

eﬀects allow for a modiﬁcation of the total atomic density. Whether one calls this ”atomic bunching” or ”matter
grating” production is a matter of personal preference [5]. The key point is that the modiﬁcation of the total atomic
density results entirely from eﬀects related to recoil on the absorption, emission, or scattering of radiation. To
lowest order in the atom-ﬁeld interaction, the matter grating or atomic bunching consists of a spatial modulation
k2|
of the atomic density having period 2π/
. With increasing ﬁeld strength, higher order spatial harmonics
are produced, corresponding to ”higher order matter gratings” or ”focusing” or ”atomic bunching.” Of course it is
possible to derive an eﬀective potential of the form

without quantization of the center-of-mass motion and to consider classical motion in this potential. However, since
the eﬀective potential is proportional to ¯h, any changes in the atomic density vanish in the classical limit. This is in
contrast to bunching in the free electron laser where the eﬀective potential does not vanish in the classical limit.

Are there situations where matter gratings are produced by ﬁelds without any contribution from recoil? The answer
to this question is ”yes,” provided one considers the matter gratings associated with individual internal atomic states
rather than the total atomic density. For example,for an ensemble of stationary, closed, two-level atoms there is a
spatial modulation in the population diﬀerence between the excited and ground states produced by the pump and
probe ﬁelds. Scattering of the pump ﬁeld from this spatially modulated population diﬀerence leads to a dispersion-
shaped probe absorption proﬁle centered at a probe-pump detuning δ = 0 in the limit of large atom-ﬁeld detuning
∆. The amplitude of the dispersion proﬁle varies as the square of the pump ﬁeld intensity and its width is equal to
the excited state decay rate [15]. It is also possible to have gain proﬁles with a width corresponding to some eﬀective
ground state decay time if one considers open systems in which spontaneous emission also plays a role. For example,
if the ground state consists of two hyperﬁne states and the ﬁelds drive transitions between only one of these ground
states and an excited state, then, as a result of spontaneous emission, both ground state sublevel populations can be
spatially modulated (although the total atomic density - the sum of all ground and excited state populations - remains
constant in the absence of recoil). It is possible to monitor the atomic gratings in speciﬁc ground state hyperﬁne
levels by using radiation that couples only the targeted ground state sublevel to an excited state.

Finally, I would like to discuss some experimental implications of the RIR and CARL. To observe the spectral
features of the RIR and CARL, it is best to use cold atoms in a collisionless environment. Moreover, to isolate the
eﬀects of interest, one must use experiments which involve closed, two-level transitions or signals that depend only
on total atomic state density. The RIR have already been observed in several experiments involving laser-cooled
atoms [5–9]. The experiments in which evidence for CARL was claimed [21,22] were all carried out under conditions
(collisions, radiation trapping, large Doppler widths) which do not favor observation of CARL. The results of these
experiments can be explained by conventional theories in which recoil is neglected [23]. As was mentioned previously,
the CARL limit is essentially a subrecoil limit. Although the CARL limit has been stated as r = qu
1, when Q > 1,
ωq
Q1/3 <
a better estimate for the CARL regime is qu
1 [19]. For densities of order 1018atoms/m3, it is possible to
ωq
∼
achieve values of Q1/3 of order 100-1000. Thus, it may be possible to observe CARL for atoms cooled to or somewhat
above the sub-Doppler limit of laser cooling. The linear gain coeﬃcient in this case is of order 107s−
1, which must
exceed any cavity loss.

Is it possible to observe the RIR in a thermal vapor using pump-probe spectroscopy? The linear absorption rate is

, where Ea = mu2/2 is the kinetic energy of the atoms. For sub-Doppler cooled atoms, this ratio can
be greater than unity, but it is small at room temperature. Still it might be possible to use modulation techniques to
isolate the RIR contribution to the probe absorption. For the RIR signal to be larger than the background, dispersion-

[19] A more precise statement of the CARL limit is qP0/M <

∼ Q1/3ωq, where Q is deﬁned by Eq. (50). This condition follow
from Eq. (38), where evaluating χ2(t′) in the integrand at t′ = t requires that χ2(t′) be slowly varying with respect to
/M), and the fact that χ2(t) varies as eηQ1/3ωq t for Q ≫ 1 and Q1/3ωqt > 1, where η is a constant of order
exp(iq · Pt
unity. Similarly, the region of simple exponential gain for CARL occurs for times t > (Q1/3ωq)−1 and, when ground state
decay is included, the ﬁeld dependence is local if Γ ≫ Q1/3ωq.

Abstract. Electron–impact excitation of Xe atoms in pure Xe gas and in a
Xe(10 %)–Ar(90 %) mixture has led to the discovery of infrared (IR) luminescence
of Xe2 excimers. The investigation of the emission spectrum at low gas density has
allowed the identiﬁcation of the molecular states involved in the transition. When
the gas density is increased to values up to 40 times larger than the density of the
ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure, the interaction of the excimer
with the dense environment produces a strong red–shift of the spectrum that is
interpreted in terms of many–body eﬀects.

IR luminescence of Xe2 excimers

1. Introduction

2

The luminescence of rare gas excimers is studied extensively for applications in the
vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) including production of coherent and incoherent VUV light
sources [1] and detection of ionizing radiation [2]. Xe is of particular interest because
of its eﬃciency to convert the excitation energy in intense VUV radiation. When
the gas is excited by means of several techniques including electrical discharges [3],
irradiation with ionizing particles [4; 5; 6], or resonance lines [7; 8; 9; 10; 11], three–
body collisions of excited and ground state atoms lead to the formation of the excited
dimer, i. e., excimer, Xe⋆
2. The decay of the lowest lying excited levels towards the
dissociative ground state of the molecule gives origin to the emission of the 1st and
2nd VUV continua at about 152 and 170 nm, respectively.

Owing to their relevance for so many applications, these VUV excimer bands
have been thouroughly studied theoretically [12; 13; 14; 15] and experimentally
[11; 16; 17; 18; 19] in order to ascertain the molecular structure and potential energy
curves and the kinetics of the deexcitation processes leading to the population of the 6s
excited atomic states that are eventually involved in the production of these molecular
states [1; 8; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28].

At quite low gas pressure (P < 20 kPa), the VUV luminesce signal consists of
the 1st continuum. On the contrary, at higher pressure (P > 50 kPa), only the 2nd
continuum is present in the spectrum. This diﬀerent behavior of the two continua as a
function of pressure has been explained by time–resolved spectroscopic studies showing
that the 1st continuum is due to radiative transitions from the vibrationally excited
u )v′≫0 state correlated with the resonant 5p56s (3P1) atomic state towards the
(0+
dissociative 0+
g ground state, whereas the 2nd continuum consists of the overlapping
bound–free emission from the lowest vibrationally relaxed (0−
u , 1u) states correlated
with the metastable 5p56s (3P2) atomic state.

Nearly no attention at all has been paid to the possibility that molecular
infrared (IR) transitions may occur in the cascade of processes leading to the
formation of the excimer states radiating in the VUV. Only an IR spectrum centered
about 800 nm has been observed and its appearance has been attributed to a
g (6p[1/2]0) → 0+
0+
u (6s[3/2]1)v′≫0 transition [9]. One possible reason for this lack
of interest on IR processes may be that the minimum of higher–lying excimer states
occurs at an internuclear distance at which the weakly bound molecular ground state
is strongly repulsive and is therefore not so easily accessible by multiphoton selective
excitation. On the contrary, broad–band excitation techniques using high–energy
charged particles [6; 21] may produce excited atoms of such high kinetic energy that
may collide with ground state atoms at short distance yielding molecular states in
higher energy levels although their parity cannot be controlled.

We have recently discovered a broad band in the near IR region centered at a
wave number ˜νm ≈ 7800 cm−1, i. e., λ ≈ 1.3 µm. The emission is produced by exciting
the gas at room temperature by means of short pulses of electrons of 70 keV energy
[29; 30]. Technical details of the experiment can be found in literature.

The IR band is quite broad. At P ≈ 20 kPa, its FWHM is Γ ≈ 900 cm−1. The
relative width Γ/˜νm ≈ 0.115 is comparable with that of the 2nd continuum [5; 31].
This IR band occurs both in the pure gas and in an Ar (90 %)–Xe (10 %) mixture.
As the features of the spectrum in both gases in the limit of low P are identical, we
attribute the emission to a Xe2 molecular bound–free transition.

Improvements in our experimental apparatus have allowed us to carry out more

IR luminescence of Xe2 excimers

accurate time–integrated measurements of the excimer IR emission at low pressure
and also to extend the investigated density range up to density nearly 40 times larger
than the density of the ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure (273 K and 0.1
MPa). By so doing, we have now the opportunity to better assign the molecular states
involved in the transition and to elucidate the interaction of the excited molecules with
a dense gas environment.

The electronic structure of homonuclear rare gas excimers can be described by
an ionic molecular core surrounded by an electron in a diﬀuse Rydberg orbital much
larger in diameter than the internuclear distance [12; 32; 33]. Such a state can still
exist in a high–pressure environment provided that the optically active electron is only
weakly scattered oﬀ the atoms of the host gas. This occurs if the electron mean free
path is larger than the orbit of the Rydberg state as it happens to be at low density.
It is therefore interesting to look at the evolution of a molecular Rydberg state when
the environment becomes increasingly denser. In our previous experiments [29; 30] we
have mainly detected a red–shift of the IR emission spectrum of the excimer. In this
experiment we conﬁrm the previous results in an extended density range.

2. Low–density results

In Fig. 1 we show an experimental IR emission spectrum recorded in pure Xe gas
at P ≈ 0.1 MPa at room temperature in an extended wave number range with a
resolution of 16 cm−1. The broad line shape is the molecular excimer band centered

at ˜νm ≈ 7800 cm−1.

Several atomic lines appear in the emission spectrum as to be expected because of
the broad band excitation induced by electron impact. It is particularly interesting to

IR luminescence of Xe2 excimers

note that an atomic line produced in a 7s [1/2]o − 6p [1/2]0 atomic transition [34]
appears to be embedded in the excimer band. The closeness of such an atomic
transition to the excimer spectrum suggests that the upper molecular state may be
correlated with a 5p56p atomic limit.

Only recently theoretical potential energy curves for the higher lying molecular
states of Xe2 have appeared in literature [14; 15]. It is therefore now possible to test
the accuracy of some of the theoretical potentials by comparing this ﬁrst experimental
excimer IR emission spectrum with that simulated by using standard Franck–Condon
calculations [35; 36].

We thus assume that a bound–free transition is responsible of the observed
emission and that the upper bound state is correlated with the 6p [1/2]0 atomic state.
The molecular potential correlated with this state shows an avoided crossing with
the g molecular state related to the 5d [1/2]1 state leading to predissociation [23].
The predissociation lifetime is estimated to be τp ≈ 10−10 s, whereas the mean time
between collisions at the density of the present experiment, Ne ≈ 2.4 · 1025 m−3, is
τc ≤ 10−11 s. Thus, the large collision rate electronically stabilizes excimers before
they predissociate.

At present, there are no estimates of the radiative lifetime and of the decay rate
for vibrational relaxation for this bound state. We thus assume that they are not too
diﬀerent from those of the states responsible for the emission of the VUV continua.
u and (1u, 0−
The radiative lifetimes of the highly excited vibrational states of the 0+
u )
molecular states correlated with the 6s atomic limit are estimated to be τ1 ≈ 5 ns [20]
and τ2 ≈ 40 ns [16], respectively. Similarly, the decay rate for vibrational relaxation
k3 is the same for all those state [8], yielding a decay time τ3 = (k3Ne)−1 ≈ 0.65 ns.
This hierarchy of characteristic times τc < τp < τ3 < τ1 < τ2 supports
the assumption that collisions stabilize excimers electronically and quickly establish
thermal equilibrium among their internal rovibrational degrees of freedom.

Franck–Condon calculations require the knowledge of the potential energy curves
whose choice among those reported in literature [15] has to comply with several
requirements: 1) the upper bound state must belong to the 6p atomic manifold; 2)
the parity of the initial and ﬁnal state must obey the selection rules u ↔ g and + ↔+;
3) the energy diﬀerence between the two potential energy curves at the coordinate of
the minimum of the bound state potential must approximately be equal to the central
wave number ˜νm of the observed spectrum.

According to these criteria, the upper bound state has been assigned as the (3)0+
u
ungerade state correlated with the 6p (1D2) limit (with some contributions due to the
mixing with a 5d atomic state) [15]. The lower dissociative state has been assigned
g gerade state correlated with the 6s (3P1) resonant atomic state [15]. For
as the (1)0+
both of these molecular states the projection Ω of the electronic angular momentum
along the molecular axis is zero. Thus, as in this transition Ω = 0 → Ω = 0, the
additional selection rule for the total molecular angular momentum ∆J = ±1 must
be also taken into account.

The intensity of the line shape, at inﬁnite resolution, is computed within the
centroid approximation because the electronic transition moments are not known as
a function of the internuclear coordinates for the states at hand [35; 36], thus yielding

The vibrational eigenvalues ǫv′ and eigenfunctions |v′, J ′i are found by integrating
numerically the Schr˝odinger equation for the rotationless potential of the bound
state by adopting the Numerov–Cooley ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme [37] and replacing
the centrifugal potential with the constant value B′

Figure 2. Comparison of the experimental and calculated spectra. Dashed
curve:
spectrum computed by using literature potentials. Thick solid line:
spectrum computed by using a R−12 repulsive potential with adjustable
parameters.

The dashed line is the spectrum calculated by using the theoretical potential
energy curves found in literature. The agreement is only qualitative. The synthetic
spectrum is centered at much smaller wavenumbers than the experimental one and
also its width is much larger than observed. These features are the consequence of
the fact that the theoretical potential energy curves are too close to each other and
that the dissociative potential is probably too steep in the region of the minimum of
the bound state. The only correct feature shown by the computed spectrum is its
asymmetric shape with a longer tail towards higher energies. This feature is due to
the non negligible contribution of vibrational states with v′ > 0.

It is, however, possible, by inverting the line shape, to reconstruct the repulsive
part of the dissociative potential in a coordinate range, over which the vibrational
wavefunctions of the bound state are non negligible [36].

As only few vibrational levels of the bound state are thermally excited, the choice
of the analytical form of the bound state potential is not too critical and we assume

n
IR luminescence of Xe2 excimers

that the bound state is correctly described by the theoretical literature potential
(3)0+
u [15]. We also assume that the repulsive part of the potential of the dissociative
(1)0+
g state is described by an inverse power law potential of the type

Vr = A +

(x = R/Re′ )

V0
x12

in which A and V0 are adjustable parameters. For each pair (A, V0) the scattering
eigenfunctions are to be computed anew in order to calculate the Franck–Condon
factors. The best agreement with the observed spectrum is obtained by setting
A = (5315 ± 32) cm−1 and V0 = (760 ± 16) cm−1. The spectrum computed by
using these values of the parameters is shown as a thick solid line in Fig. 2 and
is in nearly perfect agreement with the experimental one. The blue asymmetry of the
experimental spectrum is also well reproduced and is due to the contributions of the
vibrational states with v′ > 0.

In Fig. 3 we compare the theoretical and best ﬁt potentials. We also plot the potential
energy curve of the upper bound state along with the vibrational eigenfunctions for
v′ = 0 and 8, respectively, in order to show over what coordinate range the comparison
between the two determinations of the dissociative potential is meaningful.

The diﬀerence between the theoretical and best ﬁt potentials (approximately
880 cm−1 for R = Re′ ) is fairly large. Probably, a theoretical determination of the
electronic transition moments for these states or an improvement of the theoretical
calculations of the potential energy curves might reduce the disagreement between the
experimental and theoretical determination of the potential energy curves.

IR luminescence of Xe2 excimers

In any case, it has been demonstrated that the IR emission spectrum is due to a
transition between two molecular states correlated with atomic limits in the 6p and
6s manifold, respectively.

3. High–density results

When the density N of the gas is increased, the increasingly stronger interaction of
the Xe2 excimers with the environment aﬀects the features of the emission spectrum.
On one hand, as expected, the collision frequency increase reduces the lifetime of this
species. Thus, the spectrum width broadens linearly with N.

On the other hand, the center of the emission band shifts unexpectedly to lower wave
numbers as N increases. A linear relationship of the type

˜νm = ˜νm,0 − AN

(8)

describes accurately the experimental data.

This linear trend is observed both in pure Xe gas and in the mixture, although the
slope has quite diﬀerent values in the two diﬀerent gases, and is obeyed for densities
as high as N ≈ 8 · 1026 m−3, i. e., for densities nearly 40 times larger than the density
of the ideal gas at T = 273 K and P = 0.1 MPa.

In Fig. 4 the central wave number of the spectrum, ˜νm, is shown as a function
of N. In the limit N → 0, ˜νm has the same value, the Xe2 excimer being produced
either in the pure gas or in the mixture.

By contrast, when the Xe2 excimer is produced in the pure gas, the density
dependence of ˜νm is much stronger than in the case in which Xe2 is produced in the

n
IR luminescence of Xe2 excimers

mixture. If the data are ﬁt to straight lines, the following values for the slope are
obtained: A = (2.08 ± 0.04) · 10−22 m2 in pure Xe and A = (0.63 ± 0.015) · 10−22
m−2 in the mixture. We have to stress the fact, however, that the lines in Fig. 4
are not such linear ﬁts but represent the predictions of a simple theoretical model
that we have developed in order to understand the physics of the phenomenon we are
investigating [29].

According to the suggestions of Mulliken [12], an excited state of a diatomic rare
gas molecule can be envisaged as an ionic core, e. g., Xe+
2 , plus a Rydberg electron in
an extended orbital. We assume that the electron is so largely delocalized that many
atoms of the host gas are encompassed within the large electron orbit. These atoms
are polarized by the strong ﬁeld of the ionic core. If the density is large enough, we
can assume that the dielectric screening exerted by the polarized atoms can be treated
by introducing the density–dependent dielectric constant of the gas, K(N ).

The interaction potentials are of electrostatic nature and are therefore reduced
by a factor 1/K 2 with respect to the dilute gas condition. At the densities of the
experiment, the dielectric constant can be Taylor–expanded to ﬁrst order as a function
of N : K ≈ 1 + N α/ǫ0, where α is the atomic polarizability of the atoms of the host
gas and ǫ0 it the vacuum permittivity.

The energy diﬀerence between the upper bound potential V0+

and the lower
is reduced by the same factor. The average energy diﬀerence
dissociative potential V0+
that approximately corresponds to the central wave number of the observed emission
spectrum is thus given by

zero–density limit of the central wave number of the emission spectrum. A linear
dependence of ˜νm is thus obtained.

u

g

Unfortunately, if only this solvation eﬀect were accounted for, the slope ˜νm,0α/ǫ0
would amount to only half of the observed value. The missing contribution arises
from quantum many–body eﬀects in the interaction of the delocalized electron with
the atoms of the surrounding gas. In fact, the wavelength of the loosely bound Rydberg
electron in the excited dimer is very large and spans over many surroundings atoms.
Such a state can exist provided that the electron is weakly scattered oﬀ the gas atoms,
i. e., if the electron mean free path is much larger than the radius of its orbit, as it
occurs in the present case [29].

In this situation, the Rydberg electron can be considered as nearly free and its
simultaneous interaction with many atoms of the host gas leads to a density–dependent
shift of its energy given by [43]

∆E(N ) =

where a is the electron–atom scattering length and m is the electron mass.

This contribution has to be added to the energy diﬀerence between the initial
and ﬁnal state of the molecule, eventually leading to the following expression for the
energy of the emitted IR photon in the center of the spectrum

The present model predicts a linear density–dependence of the wave number
corresponding to the maximum of the spectrum, as actually observed. Moreover,
the slope can be calculated if the gas parameters α and a are known. In the case of
the heavier rare gases, the scattering length is negative and its contribution eﬀectively
adds to the solvation contribution.

In the pure gas, the choice of the gas parameters is obvious. In the case of the
mixture, the low concentration of Xe leads to the assumption that the excimer is
actually surrounded by Ar atoms so that the parameters of Ar have to be chosen.

In the case of the pure Xe gas, α = 4.45 · 10−45 F·m [44] and a = −3.09 ˚A [45],
yielding (2˜νm,0α/ǫ0 − ~a/mc) = 1.98·10−22 m2, to be compared with the experimental
value (2.08 ± 0.04) · 10−22 m2. In the cas of the mixture, the Ar parameters are
α = 1.827 · 10−40 F·m [44] and a = −0.86 ˚A [45], yielding a slope value 0.66 · 10−22
m2, to be compared with the experimental value (0.63 ± 0.015) · 10−22 m−2.
The theoretical prediction agrees very well with the experiment.

In Fig 4 the
straight lines actually represent the theoretical prediction and are not a mere linear
ﬁt to the data.

It is interesting to note that the dielectric screening eﬀect always produces a red–
shift of the excimer emission spectrum because it reduces the strength of the Coulomb
interaction between the Rydberg electron and the ion core. On the contrary, the
multiple scattering eﬀect gives a contribution to the energy of the emitted photon
whose sign depends on the nature of the (nearly free) electron–atom interaction. If
this is attractive, as in the case of the heavier rare gases, the electron–atom scattering
length is negative, whereas it is positive in the case of Ne and He. Thus, roughly
speaking, the density–dependent shift of the emission spectrum might be “ﬁne tuned”
from red– to (even) blue–shift by suitably choosing the buﬀer gas in which Xe excimers
are produced. Further investigations in diﬀerent mixtures should help conﬁrming this
model.

4. Conclusions

The study of the infrared emission spectrum of Xe excimers in pure Xe gas or in
an Ar–Xe mixture reveals interesting features in both the low– and high–density
limits. The analysis of the spectrum at low density has allowed the assignment of
the molecular states involved in the transition. This was never done before because
no IR molecular spectra of Xe in the present range were observed before. Moreover, it
has been possible to give an experimental determination of the potential energy curve
of a gerade molecular state related to the 6s manifold.

On the other hand, it has been possible to see how cooperative– and many–body
eﬀects continuously develop by increasing the density up to quite high values. The
change of the excimer emission spectrum with the gas density reveals that (at least)
two kinds of mechanisms, one classical and one quantum, aﬀect the interaction of the
excimer with its environment. In our opinion, it is worth noting that the quantum
contribution to the self–energy of the nearly free Rydberg electron links a typical issue
of molecular physics such as the emission spectrum of a decaying diatomic molecule
to the (apparently) uncorrelated realm of electron transport in dense gases. In fact,
also in that case the density dependent shift of the electron energy due to multiple
scattering deeply aﬀects electron transport [46; 47; 48].

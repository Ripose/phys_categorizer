A new approach is developed to derive the complete spectrum of

exact interdimensional degeneracies for a quantum three-body system

in D-dimensions. The new method gives a generalization of previous

methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

The property of quantum systems in high dimensions and its relationship with that

in three dimensions has aroused great interest in statistic mechanics, particle physics,

and nuclear physics [1–5]. A characteristic feature for a quantum few body system

in D dimensions is existence of exact interdimensional degeneracies. For any central

force problem in D dimensions an isomorphism exists between angular momentum L

and dimension D such that each unit increment in L is equivalent to two-unit incre-

ment in D, as perhaps ﬁrst noticed by Van Vleck [6]. For one-electron system states

related by the dimensional link D, l ↔ (D − 2), (l + 1) are exactly degenerate [7]. For

two-electron system Herrick and Stillinger found exact interdimensional degeneracies

between the states 1,3P e and 1,3Do in D = 3 and the states 3,1Se and 3,1P o in D = 5,

respectively [8]. These interdimensional degeneracies [5,7–14] were supposed [12,9] to

permit that the accurate energies for the states 1,3P e and 1,3Do in D = 3 may be cal-

culated with reduced eﬀort by implementing the same procedures which calculate the

states 3,1Se and 3,1P o in D = 5, respectively. The pattern of approximate interdimen-

sional degeneracies among doubly excited states of two-electron atoms has also been

nicely elucidated [13] by means of the molecular orbital description. This link, between

dimension and orbital angular momentum as a pervasive feature, can be used to clas-

sify groups of quasidegenerate doubly excited atomic energies and to explain striking

similarities among certain pairs of hyperspherical or molecular-orbital two-electron po-

tential curves [13]. Interdimensional degeneracies can also be used to construct part of

the D-dimensional spiked harmonic oscillator and anharmonic oscillator bound-state

spectra [15,16].

As is well known, dimensional scaling methods provide a powerful approach for

studying atomic and molecular systems in D dimensions [5,17–22], but much work

has been conﬁned to S-wave states and some P e states [7–9] which were obtained by

exploiting a known interdimensional degeneracies between Se states in 5 dimensions

and P e states in 3 dimensions. Applications of dimensional scaling methods to higher

angular momentum states of multi-electron systems are sparse [5,7–14]. Recently, by

the method of group theory, Dunn and Watson developed a formalism for the N-

electron D-dimensional Schwartz expansion [23,24], and applied the principle method to

the Schr¨odinger equation for two-electron system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space

[25,26]. The resulting set of coupled diﬀerential equations in the internal variables,

enabling the methods of dimensional scaling to be applied to higher-angular-momentum

states. In addition, the coupled diﬀerential equations can show the complete spectrum

of exact interdimensional degeneracies of two-electron system [25,26].

Despite the achievements outlined above, the method by Dunn and Watson [23–26]

2

seems quite complicated. To apply the methods of dimensional scaling to higher-

angular-momentum states, a formalism needs to be developed which factors the D-

dimensional rotational degrees of freedom from the internal degrees of freedom. They

have to make several steps to decompose an n-rank tensor to irreducible tensors by

making use of the method of group theory [27,28]. They ﬁrst decomposed an n-rank

tensor space into (a + 1)-fold traceless tensor subspaces. Then, they applied the Young

operators on the one-fold traceless tensor space to project it into the irreducible in-

variant tensor subspace. At last, they analyze the equivalence of those representations

and pick up the independent basis of the angular momentum belonging to the given

irreducible representation by the generalized Schwartz identities. Each step in the

decomposition is very complicated.

It is worth pointing out that the set of variables r(1), · · ·, r(N ), r(1,2), r(1,3), · · ·,

r(N −1,N ) is not a complete set of internal variables even in three dimensions [29] be-

cause they cannot describe the conﬁguration uniquely. One can convince himself by

the following counter example. For three-electron system in three-dimensions the six

variables r(1), r(2), r(3), r(1,2), r(1,3), and r(2,3) cannot distinguish two states related by

spatial inversion in the body-ﬁxed frame.

Another complicated problem occurs in the formalism for N-electron system in

D-dimensions. Since a right-hand rectangular coordinate frame in D-dimensions is

determined by (D − 1) vectors which are linearly independent, the situations for N-

electron system with N > D − 1 and N ≤ D − 1 are very diﬀerent [29]. On the other

hand, the possible irreducible representations of SO(D) are diﬀerent for D > 2N,

D = 2N, and D < 2N. Unfortunately, the complicated situations were not discussed

in the formalism [23,24] in detail.

In our recent paper [30], we presented a new method of separating the rotational

degrees of freedom from the internal degrees of freedom for three-body system in D-

dimensions. After removing the motion of the center of mass there are two Jacobi co-

ordinate vectors for a three-body system, just like two position vectors in two-electron

3

system where the mass of nucleus is assumed to be inﬁnite. An angular momentum

state for a three-body system in D dimensions is described by the irreducible repre-

sentation of SO(D) denoted by a two-row Young diagram [µ, ν]. Two states in three

dimensions with the same angular momentum l and the diﬀerent parities belong to

the same irreducible representation of SO(3), but in D-dimensions where D > 3 they

belong to diﬀerent irreducible representations denoted by the Young diagrams [l, 0] and

[l, 1] of SO(D). We explicitly ﬁnd the independent base-function for the highest weight

state of each irreducible representation [µ, ν], which is a homogeneous polynomial of

the components of two Jacobi coordinate vectors and satisﬁes the Laplace equation.

Its partners can be calculated from it by the lowering operator. Any wave function of

this system with a given angular momentum [µ, ν] can be expressed as a combination

of the base-functions where the coeﬃcients are called the generalized radial functions.

The generalized radial equations satisﬁed by the generalized radial functions are easily

derived explicitly [30]. The general interdimensional degeneracies for any angular mo-

mentum [µ, ν] can be found from the generalized radial equations, which is the main

purpose of this Letter.

The plan of this Letter is as follows.

In Sec.

II, we outline the method given

in our recent work and emphasize the derivation for the generalized radial equations

for a quantum three-body system in D-dimensions. The reader is suggested to refer

our published papers [29,30] for the detail. The interdimensional degeneracies for this

system will be demonstrated from the generalized radial equations in Sec. III. Some

conclusions will be given in Section IV.

II. GENERALIZED RADIAL EQUATIONS IN D-DIMENSIONS

In our recent paper [29] we separated completely the global rotational degrees of

freedom in the Schr¨odinger equation for an N-body system in the three-dimensional

space from the internal ones. We have determined a complete set of (2l + 1) inde-

4

pendent base-functions for a given total orbital angular momentum l, which are the

homogeneous polynomials in the components of the Jacobi coordinate vectors and do

not contain the Euler angles explicitly. The generalized radial equations which depend

solely on internal variables are established. For the typical three-body system in three

dimensional space, such as a helium atom [31–33] and a positronium negative ion [34],

the generalized radial equations have been solved numerically with high precision. This

method was generalized to the arbitrary dimensional space for a three-body system.

After removing the motion of center of mass, the Schr¨odinger equation with a

spherically symmetric potential V in D-dimensions can be expressed in terms of the

Jacobi coordinate vectors x and y, where the atomic units (e = ¯h = 1) are used for

simplicity, [30]:

where rj and mj are the position vector and the mass of the j-th particle, respectively.

The orbital angular momentum in D-dimensions is described by the irreducible

representation of SO(D), denoted by a two-row Young diagram [µ, ν]. We only need

to ﬁnd the base-function of angular momentum corresponding to the highest weight

M of the representation [µ, ν]. Its partners can be calculated from it by the angular

momentum operator Lab [30]. It was proved that the following harmonic polynomial

Qµν

q (x, y) construct the independent and complete set of the highest weight states of

[µ, ν]:

Y34 = y3 + iy4.

The formula for Qµν

q (x, y) holds for D = 3 (x4 = y4 = 0, ν = 0 or 1) [30] and D > 4.

Obviously, the base-function Qµν

q (x, y) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree q and

(µ + ν − q) in the components of the Jacobi coordinate vectors x and y, respectively,

and does not contain any angle variables explicitly. It is easy to check that Qµν

q (x, y)

satisﬁes following formulas:

applying the Laplace operator ▽2

M (x, y), the calculation

consists of three parts. The ﬁrst is to apply the Laplace operator to the generalized

radial functions ψµν

q (ξ1ξ2ξ3), which can be calculated by replacement of variables. The

second is to apply it to Qµν

q (x, y), which is vanishing due to Eq. (4). The last part is

.

It is evident that the radial equations (7) are invariant under the replacement

µ, ν, q, (D + 2) ⇐⇒ (µ + 1), (ν + 1), (q + 1), D,

(8)

yielding the complete spectrum of the exact interdimensional degeneracies between the

[µ, ν] state in (D + 2)-dimensions and the [µ + 1, ν + 1] state in D-dimensions. The

parities of both states on two sides of correspondence (8) have the same value (−1)µ−ν.

In comparison with the interdimensional degeneracies discussed in literatures [5,7–14],

µ = l, ν = 0, and the parity is (−1)l.

Consider a system where two electrons move around a nucleus, such as a D-

dimensional helium atom. It is a typical three-body system where the ﬁrst and second

particles are chosen to be two electrons and the third one is the nucleus.

In the

7

non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the concept of spin comes from the experimental

results, not from the equation. As usual [5,3], we also assume that the spin of an

electron in the D-dimensional space is 1/2, just as that in the real three dimensional

space, and the total wave function of two electrons is antisymmetric in the permutation

of them. Since the Jacobi coordinate vector x changes its sign in the permutation R

of two electrons and y keeps invariant, we obtain from Eq. (2) that the permutation

parity of the base-function Qµν

q (x, y) is (−1)q:

R Qµν

q (x, y) = (−1)q Qµν

q (x, y).

(9)

In the permutation of two electrons Qµν

q (x, y) and Q(µ+1)(ν+1)

q+1

(x, y) have the opposite

permutation parities. Therefore, two states in the interdimensional degeneracy (8)

must have the diﬀerent spin S = 1 and S = 0, respectively. In summary, we obtain the

complete spectrum of the exact interdimensional degeneracies as follows. For a given

parameter a = 0 or 1, all the states with the orbital angular momentum [µ + n, ν + n],

the spin S = [1 + (−1)a+n]/2, and the parity (−1)µ−ν in the dimension D − n are

interdimensional degenerate where n is an arbitrary integer satisfying D ≥ n ≥ −ν.

These general interdimensional degeneracies include all those degeneracies discovered

in literatures [5,7–14].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this Letter we have provided a systematic procedure for analysis of observed

degeneracies among diﬀerent states in diﬀerent dimensions and yielded considerable

insight into the energy spectra of three body system. Since the generalized radial

equations (7) for a quantum three-body system with a spherically symmetric potential

V in D-dimensions are derived without any approximation [30], the interdimensional

degeneracies given at the end of the preceding section are exact and general. This

general interdimensional degeneracies for a three-body systems should be generalized

to N-body system, which is our future task.

8

Before ending this Letter we would like to make a remark. The energy E is com-

pletely determined by the solution of the coupled diﬀerential equations (7) with a

suitable boundary conditions, although we could not solve Eq. (7) analytically but

only numerically. Since the equations for two states in the general interdimensional

degeneracies are exactly the same, their energies must be the same. However, in the

practical numerical calculations [31–34] we expanded the solutions as a Taylor series

in the orthogonal bases, which depend on the integral in the conﬁguration space. As

pointed out in Eq. (44) of our recent paper [30] the volume element of the conﬁgu-

ration space contains a factor (ξ1ξ2 − ξ2

3)(D−3)/2, which depends on the dimension D.

On the other hand, a straightforward calculation shows that the integrals over the

angular variables for the base-function Q(µ+1)(ν+1)

q+1

(x, y) in D-dimensions contains one

more factor (ξ1ξ2 − ξ2

3) than that for the base-function Qµν

q (x, y) in (D + 2)-dimensions

so that two wave functions of the states in the general interdimensional degeneracies

have the same integral in the conﬁguration space.

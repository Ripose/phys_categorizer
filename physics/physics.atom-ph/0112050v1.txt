Abstract

We have constructed the X 1Σ+
g potential for the collision between two ground
state Mg atoms and analyzed the eﬀect of uncertainties in the shape of the
potential on scattering properties at ultra-cold temperatures. This potential
reproduces the experimental term values to 0.2 cm−1 and has a scattering
length of +1.4(5) nm where the error is prodominantly due to the uncertainty
in the dissociation energy and the C6 dispersion coeﬃcient. A positive sign
of the scattering length suggests that a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground
state Mg atoms is stable.

I. INTRODUCTION

It was shown in Ref. [1] that Mg atoms can be magneto-optically trapped. This oﬀers
many possible applications of cold Mg atoms for ultra high resolution spectroscopy, new
frequency standards and collective quantum eﬀects. A magnesium clock has already been
developed by Ref. [2]. The most abundant isotopes of Mg have a single electronic ground
state without hyperﬁne interactions, which opens a road to simpler theoretical modeling
of ground state atomic collisions as compared to the modeling of, say, alkali-metal atom
collisions [3].

Magnesium is not the only alkaline earth species that can be magnetically and opti-
cally manipulated. Ingenious cooling schemes exist for Ca [4] and Sr [5–8]. For Sr Ref. [5]
have nearly reached the quantum degeneracy regime. Optical clocks based on the ultra-cold
calcium have been constructed for Mg [2] and Ca [9–13]. The ﬁrst experimental photoassoci-
ation spectra were reported for calcium [14] while photoassociation spectroscopy for alkaline
earth atoms has been studied theoretically in Ref. [15]

The coldest temperatures in dilute atomic gases are obtained by a process called evapo-
rative cooling. Ground state collisions are crucial for evaporative cooling. Elastic collisions
during this process lead to a thermalization of atoms and under the right conditions forma-
tion of a Bose condensate. Elastic collision rates at ultra cold temperatures can be described
by a single parameter, the scattering length a. Formation of Bose-Einstein condensates is
determined by the nonlinear coupling parameter in the condensate Schr¨odinger equation,
which in turn depends on the sign and value of the scattering length.

Inelastic collisions, which change the internal state of the atoms, can eject trapped atoms.
Examples of inelastic processes are, for example, spin-exchange, spin-depolarization, and
Penning and associative ionization, where the ﬁrst two have been observed in alkali-metal
gases [3] and the latter have been observed in metastable rare gas samples [16]. For alkaline-
earth atoms the electronic ground state is solely composed of closed shells and is a 1S0 state.
Consequently, no inelastic atom-atom collisions can occur. This opens a pathway to more
eﬃcient evaporative cooling.

In this paper we present our calculation of the ground state Mg2 scattering length and
cross-section as a function of the collision energy, using a potential constructed from high
resolution spectra of the magnesium dimer measured by Balfour and Douglas [17]. At
temperatures below 5 mK ground state Mg collisions are in the s-wave scattering regime
and the l = 0 phase shift determines the cross-section and, at zero collision energy, the
scattering length. This phase shift can be found by matching the numerically evaluated
scattering wavefunction of the interaction potential to free scattering wavefunctions at large
internuclear separation R. Slight changes to the inner part of the potential can generate
signiﬁcant changes in the phase shift and the scattering length.

We will discuss several ways to obtain the interaction potential of ground state Mg2.
Firstly, a Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential curve has been constructed in Ref. [17] from
their measurement of the rovibrational levels (ν = 0 - 12, J = 10 - 76) of ground state Mg2.
Secondly, Vidal and Scheingraber [18] have reevaluated the molecular constants of Ref. [17]
and improved upon the RKR analyses by applying a variational procedure based on the
inverted perturbation approach (IPA). Finally, there exist a large number of theoretical
electronic structure calculations [19–30] of the ground state Mg2 potential. This paper

2

brieﬂy describes our ab initio multiconﬁguration valence bond (MVB) calculation of the
ground state potential. Although, as we will show, the theoretical uncertainty in the shape of
the potential is too large to predict the scattering length we nevertheless compare scattering
data for our ab initio potential and the most recently published theoretical potential by
Czuchaj et al. [30] to those for the RKR and IPA potential. This will give us a feeling for
the state of the art in molecular electronic structure calculations of interacting two electron
atoms.

This paper is set up as follows.

In Section II we describe the existing experimental
data and the potentials that have been constructed from the data. Section III presents
the theoretical calculations in the existing literature as well as a new calculation using the
multiconﬁguration valence bond method. Section IV describes the long-range behavior of
the potentials and connects this to the short-range potentials obtained in Sections II and
III. Finally, Section V discusses how well bound states of the four potentials that have been
constructed reproduce the experimental bound state energies, and determines the scattering
properties for the best of these four potentials.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND THE GROUND STATE POTENTIAL

The RKR potential of Ref. [17] and the IPA potential constructed in this work from data
published in Ref. [18] are shown in Fig. 1. For the RKR potential we use a dissociation energy
De = 424(5) cm−1 (1 cm−1 = 29.9792458 GHz), deﬁned as the energy diﬀerence between
the bottom of the potential and the asymptotic energy. Reference [18] did not provide a
tabulated IPA potential but expressed the potential in terms of Dunham coeﬃcients Ylm.
We have constructed a potential from the Ylm for l = 0-3, m = 0-5 provided in Table IV of
Ref. [18] by applying the RKR procedure. We will call this potential the IPA potential. We
will show lateron by solving the Schr¨odinger equation for the RKR and IPA potentials that
the IPA potential reproduces the term values signiﬁcantly better than the RKR potential of
Ref. [17]. For the IPA potential we take the dissociation energy De to be 431.0(1.0) cm−1
in accordance with ﬁt of Ref. [18] to the last outer turning points of the potential. The
1.0 cm−1 uncertainty is based on the sensitivity of the ﬁt with the order of the long-range
dispersion expansion. The RKR and IPA potential are only known over a limited region
of internuclear separation, 6 a0 to 14 a0. This range is determined by the inner and outer
turning point of the most-weakly-bound measured rovibrational level.

For a scattering calculation the potential must be known for all internuclear separations.
Therefore we have connected the repulsive short range of the RKR potential to the repulsive
wall of our MVB potential which will be discussed in Section III. The repulsive short range
wall of the IPA potential is a linear extrapolation from the attractive region as our MVB
potential could not be smoothly connected to the IPA potential. Both RKR and IPA
potentials suﬀer from a well known “short range turnover” in the potential inherent to the
RKR inversion procedure. We simply removed those inner turning points from the data
set before extrapolation. The extrapolation of the RKR and IPA potential to longer R is
discussed in Section IV.

III. THE AB INITIO GROUND STATE POTENTIALS

The ground state Mg2 molecule is formed from two closed shell atoms, each of which
is described by the conﬁguration 1s22s22p63s2. This might suggest that theoretical mod-
elling will be easy. Instead, numerous computational eﬀorts have proven the opposite. The
ﬁrst dramatic complication arises at the Hartree-Fock level, because it predicts a purely
repulsive ground state potential. The binding of the magnesium dimer is created by the
correlation energy only. There are inter- and intrashell correlations aﬀecting the potential,
that, apparently, have a strong dependence on internuclear separation. The question be-
comes how well a computational approach can incorporate these correlations. There are a
large number of methods [19–30] which have been tested for the computation of the correla-
tion corrections. In a pioneering publication Stevens and Krauss [23] calculated the ground
state potential of Mg2 using a nonrelativistic multiconﬁguration self-consistent ﬁeld method.
Their work shows the importance of the ability to simultaneously incorporate both the long-
range atomic and short-range molecular correlations. Many-body perturbation theory can
provide an alternative to the conﬁguration interaction approach to model correlation eﬀects
in the Mg2 molecule. Double excitation type diagrams were applied by Purvis and Bartlett
[24] to signiﬁcantly improve the molecular binding energy.

In Ref. [30] a combination of a coupled-cluster method with single and double excitations
and perturbative triple excitations is used to reach a good agreement with the RKR potential
of Ref. [17]. The potential curve of Ref. [30] is shown in Fig. 1.

For this paper we have used the multiconﬁguration valence bond (MVB) method to cal-
culate the ground state Mg2 potential. A detailed description of the computational approach
is given in Ref. [31]. We create a nonorthogonal basis set from self-consistent Dirac-Fock
atomic orbitals belonging to the [1s2] 2s2 2p6 3s2 conﬁguration and additional Sturmian
orbitals labeled 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 5s, and 5p. The closed shells 1s2 + 1s2 form the core of the
molecule and no excitations from 1s2 + 1s2 will be allowed. The 2s2, 2p6 and 3s2 orbitals
are valence orbitals and single and double excitations from these orbitals occur. Various co-
valent and ionic conﬁgurations are constructed by distributing electrons from the optimized
valence orbitals in all allowed ways over the 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 5s, and 5p orbitals. In total, there
are 1041 molecular conﬁgurations in our conﬁguration interaction. We have performed two
kinds of nonrelativistic calculations. The ﬁrst kind is aimed at calculating the best possible
short-range potential by ﬁrst perturbatively estimating the correlation energy of each molec-
ular conﬁguration excited from the ground state conﬁguration. If the estimate falls below
a threshold this conﬁguration is not included in the conﬁguration interaction procedure.
This truncation of the conﬁgurations is necessary because inclusion of all conﬁgurations in
the conﬁguration interaction procedure is not computationally possible. The second kind
of calculation gives the best possible long-range potential by excluding ionic conﬁgurations
and switching oﬀ the exchange interaction in the Hamiltonian in order to reduce the size of
the matrix and to accelerate the calculation. The two calculations are connected between
13 a0 and 14 a0, because at these internuclear separations the diﬀerence between the total
energy of the two kinds of calculations, and thus the exchange energy, is less than 5% of the
binding energy. Figure 1 shows our ground state 1Σ+
g potential of Mg2. The dissociation
energy is De = 410 cm−1.

IV. LONG-RANGE POTENTIALS

The long-range dispersion potential of the Mg2 ground state has attracted considerable
attention over the past few decades. Mg2 was the ﬁrst alkaline earth van der Waals molecule
for which a high accuracy RKR potential was obtained and thus allowing a comparison
with, or extraction of, the long-range potential. Stwalley [32,33] and Li and Stwalley [34]
constructed a dispersion potential using the form V (R) = D0 − C6/R6 − C8/R8 from the
frequency-dependent atomic dipole polarizability and the RKR curve. The dipole-dipole
dispersion coeﬃcient C6 was determined from the atomic polarizability while both D0, the
energy diﬀerence between the ν = 0, J = 0 rovibrational level and the asymptotic energy,
and dipole-quadrupole dispersion coeﬃcient C8 were then obtained by ﬁtting to the RKR
curve minus the dipole-dipole dispersion contribution. They ﬁnd D0= 404.1(0.5) cm−1, C6=
0, 1 Hartree = 4.359743 ×10−18 J), and C8= 38(8)×103
683(35) a.u. (1 a.u. = 1 Hartree a6
a.u. (1 a.u. = 1 Hartree a8
0). In Ref. [35] the C6 dispersion coeﬃcient has been calculated
based on atomic coupled-cluster theory. The result of this calculation is C6 = 647.8 a.u..
Upper and lower bounds for the dispersion coeﬃcients have been obtained in Ref. [36] using
a Pade approximation to bound the atomic multipole polarizabilities. Their ranges are C6 =
630 a.u. - 638 a.u. and C8 = 41100 a.u. - 43500 a.u.. In addition they estimated the dipole-
octupole coeﬃcient, C10, to be between 2730000 a.u. and 3040000 a.u. (1 a.u. = 1 Hartree
a10
0 ). Recently, Porsev and Derevianko [37] have calculated the C6 coeﬃcient using accurate
theoretical and experimental atomic data. Diﬀerent contributions to the C6 coeﬃcient were
obtained with diﬀerent atomic relativistic many-body electronic structure methods. The
dominant contribution to this coeﬃcient was found by combining conﬁguration interaction
and many-body perturbation theory. The reported value of C6 = 627(12) a.u. agrees quite
well with the bounds of Ref. [36]. Finally, the dispersion coeﬃcients can be evaluated
from molecular electronic structure calculations. They are extracted by ﬁtting to the long-
range shape of the interaction potential. For example, the induced dipole-dipole dispersion
coeﬃcient of Ref. [30] is about a factor of 2 larger, while that of our MVB calculation is
about 15% smaller, than that of Ref. [37].

The long-range behavior of the RKR and IPA potentials, the dispersion potential ob-
tained from Ref. [37,36], and our MVB calculation are shown in Fig. 2. The full line with
ﬁlled diamonds and full line are the RKR and IPA potentials, respectively. The dotted line
of the MVB calculation smoothly connects to the RKR at 13.53 a0. Although this smooth
connection is fortuitous, it suggests that the RKR potential be extrapolated by the MVB
potential. On the other hand the long-range dispersion potential denoted by the dash-dotted
line using the C6 coeﬃcient of Ref. [37] and C8 = 42300 a.u. and C10 = 2885000 a.u. of Ref.
[36] smoothly connects to the IPA potential. The C6 coeﬃcient of Ref. [30] leads to a too
attractive long-range behavior as shown by the dashed curve in the ﬁgure.

For our study of scattering properties the spectroscopically derived RKR and IPA poten-
tials are extrapolated to large internuclear separations R using the dispersion plus exchange
form Vdis(R)+Vex(R), where Vdis(R) = − Pn=6,8,10 Cn/Rn and Vex(R) = B×Rα×exp(−βR).
For R > 13.53 a0, the largest turning point of the RKR potential, this potential is best ex-
trapolated by the dispersion coeﬃcients extracted from the MVB potential and the exchange
potential of Ref. [38]. The exchange contribution is small but has been added for complete-
ness sake. Other values for these coeﬃcients do not seem to be consistent with the shape of

5

the RKR potential. The IPA potential ending at R = 14.5 a0 is smoothly joined to Vdis(R)
+ Vex(R) starting at R = 16 a0 The C6 coeﬃcient is taken from Ref. [37] and the C8 and
C10 coeﬃcients are taken from Ref. [36]. The exchange potential is from Ref. [38] where the
exchange parameters are α = 3.63, β = 1.512 1/a0, and B = 0.27 a.u., respectively.

V. VIBRATIONAL BOUND STATES AND SCATTERING LENGTH

In order to test the potentials constructed in the previous sections we numerically calcu-
lated the rovibrational bound states and compared them with the experimentally obtained
term values of Ref. [17]. The eigenvalues of the Schr¨odinger equation for the ground state
Hamiltonian have been obtained for each of the four (splined) adiabatic potentials shown in
Figs. 1 and 2. The ground state Hamiltonian includes the electrostatic interaction in form
g Born-Oppenheimer potential, the mechanical rotation operator, ˆl 2/2µR2, and
of the 1Σ+
the kinetic energy operator.

The experimental term values are relative to the ν = 0, J = l = 0 bound state. Con-
sequently, theoretical term values of a potential are deﬁned relative to the energy of the
ν = 0, J = 0 level of this potential. Our diﬀerence measure ∆ is given by the square root of
the averaged squared diﬀerence between the theoretical and experimental term values. The
diﬀerence averaged over 254 (ν = 0 − 12, J = l = 10 - 68) rovibrational levels lying below
the dissociation energy for four potentials is given in Table I. The table shows that the
IPA potential is one order of magnitude better than the RKR potential in representing the
experimental term values, conﬁrming the predicted improvement by Ref. [18]. The MVB
potential is about as accurate as the RKR potential while the potential of Ref. [30] is clearly
the least accurate.

We have set up a quantum scattering calculation for two ground state Mg atoms. For
ultra-cold atom physics the relevant properties of an interaction potential are the number
of s-wave bound states and the scattering length a at zero collision energy. The number of
bound states of a potential is equal to the number of nodes of the zero-energy scattering
wavefunction. We ﬁnd that the number of bound states is diﬀerent for each of our four
potentials. In fact, we have 18, 19, 18, and 20 bound states for the RKR-, IPA-, and MVB-
potential, and the potential of Ref. [30], respectively. Qualitatively, this variation can be
understood from the long-range shape of these four potentials. The dispersion potential of
Ref. [30] is the most attractive of all four potentials consistent with the observation that it
has the largest number of bound states. The diﬀerence in dissociation energy does not lead
to a change in the number of bound states. Notice that v=12 is the most-weakly-bound
experimentally observed s-wave vibrational level, that is, the last seven vibrational levels
have not been observed.

For the remainder of the paper we restrict scattering calculations to the IPA potential,
since the discrepancy with the experimental term values for the IPA potential is an order
of magnitude better than that of the others. The short-range part of the IPA potential
smoothly connects to the state-of-the-art long-range dispersion and exchange potential of
Refs. [37,36,38] and thus gives added conﬁdence in the potential.

The IPA potential is tabulated in Table II and when splined has a scattering length
of 26 a0. The scattering length of a potential is deﬁned by the phase of the wavefunction
It depends on the binding energy of the most-weakly bound s-
at zero collision energy.

wave vibrational level. In order to obtain the accuracy of the scattering length for the IPA
potential we must determine the eﬀect of small changes to the potential. The uncertainty
in the dissociation energy, the long-range dispersion coeﬃcients, and the shape of the short-
range potential limit the accuracy of our determination. The allowed variations are chosen
within the published uncertainties. The 1 cm−1 uncertainty of the dissociation energy of
Ref. [18] leads to a 7 a0 uncertainty in a. The eﬀects of the uncertainty in the dissociation
energy was studied by uniformly shifting the IPA potential for R < 14.5 a0, ﬁtting smoothly
to the dispersion potential.

The 12 a.u. uncertainty in the C6 coeﬃcient of Ref. [37] adds an additional 7 a0 un-
certainty to a, while uncertainties in the C8 and C10 coeﬃcients add 1.4 a0 and 0.5 a0,
respectively. These corrections to the potential do not change the agreement between the
calculated and experimental bound state term values. Nevertheless, a ∆ of 0.22 cm−1 does
imply that the shape of potential is not fully characterized, which introduces additional
uncertainties to the scattering length. Local changes to the potential on the order of ∆ are
needed. Since ∆ is about six times smaller than the uncertainty in the dissociation energy
we can estimate the additional uncertainty in a to be 1 a0. The largest contributions to
the uncertainty in the scattering length are, therefore, due to the uncertainty in De and C6.
None of the discussed uncertainties in the potential changes the number of bound states.
The ﬁnal value for the scattering length of the IPA potential is 26(10) a0 or 1.4(5) nm by
adding the uncertainties in quadrature. The potential has 19 s-wave bound states.

Figure 3 shows partial cross sections of two colliding ground state Mg atoms as a function
of collision energy. The contributions of s-, d-, and g-wave collisions are shown. The partial-
wave cross section is deﬁned as

σl = (2l + 1)

8π
k2 sin2 δl(k)

(1)

where δl(k) is the 1Σ+
g phase shift for l-wave collisions and k is the relative wavenumber
of the collision. The cross section is calculated for the potential which has a=26 a0 and
is tabulated in Table II. The s-wave cross section has a maximum at E/kB= 3 mK and
then decreases monotonically up to E/kB=50 mK. At zero collision energy the s-wave cross
section equals 8πa2. The d- and g-wave partial cross sections are zero at zero collision energy
and then rise rapidly and have a maximum at much higher collision energy than that given
by the height of the d- and g-wave centrifugal barrier. In fact, the centrifugal barriers are
at E/kB= 7.8 mK and 47 mK for the d- and g-wave, respectively.

In summary, we have constructed four 1Σ+

g potentials for the collision between two ground
state Mg atoms. Two of these potentials are based on the experimentally determined term
values of the dimer, while the other two were of a theoretical origin. The MVB theoretical
potential is calculated in this Paper. By comparing the experimental term values with
those calculated for the four Born-Oppenheimer potentials we conclude that the theoretical
MVB potential is of similar accuracy as the “experimentally determined” RKR potential.
Given the diﬃculty of introducing electron correlations into the molecule the agreement is
remarkable. Existing long-range dispersion and exchange coeﬃcients have been discussed as
well.

The best 1Σ+

g potential is obtained from an IPA potential for R < 14.5 a0 connected to a
dispersion potential based on Refs. [37] and [36]. This potential reproduces the experimental
term values to 0.2 cm−1, an order of magnitude better than the comparison for the other three

7

potentials, and gives a scattering length of +1.4(5) nm where the error is prodominantly due
to the uncertainty in De and the C6 dispersion coeﬃcient. A positive sign of the scattering
length suggests that a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground state Mg atoms is stable.

FIG. 1. Ground state 1Σ+

g potential energy curves obtained by diﬀerent methods as a function
of internuclear separation R. The internuclear separation is in units of a0 = 0.0529177 nm. The
solid line with ﬁlled diamonds corresponds to the RKR potential; the solid line shows the IPA
potential; the dotted line is our MVB potential and the dashed line is the potential by Ref. [30]

Abstract

We consider a hydrogenic system with a nucleus of ﬁnite mass. The coupling of the
radiation ﬁeld to the center of mass motion gives rise to an eﬀective scalar type coupling.
This induced scalar photon interaction emerges as a correction in competition with the
usual multipole interactions. This eﬀect is particularly important in positronium where
the electric quadrupole interaction is totally suppressed. We illustrate this eﬀect with the
two–photon decay of metastable hydrogenic systems.

1 Introduction

Recently, one of us [1] pointed out, within the framework of nonrelativistic spinless QED,
the emergence of an eﬀective scalar photon interaction for the atomic (hydrogenic) internal
In this simple model, the atom is a
degree of freedom due to ﬁnite mass corrections.
composite system with two particles of ﬁnite masses (m1 and m2) and charges (Z1 and
Z2) of opposite sign. In contrast to the relative motion which couples to the radiation
ﬁeld vectorially through minimal coupling, the coupling of the center of mass motion to
the radiation ﬁeld induces an eﬀective scalar type coupling for the relative motion. Thus,
when ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀect is taken into account, the induced scalar photon interaction
leads to a modiﬁcation of the multipole interactions of the atom with radiation.

Consider a system consisting of two particles of masses m1, m2 and charges Z1e, Z2e. Let
R and r denote the center of mass (c.m.) and the relative coordinate vectors and P and
p denote the momenta conjugate to R and r. To be deﬁnite, we refer to particle 1 as the
nucleus and the particle 2 as the electron. The ﬁnite mass correction is characterized by
the dimensionless quantity

δ = m2/M,

where M = m1 + m2

is the total mass of the system.
1. The inﬁnite nuclear mass
limit corresponds to δ = 0. It has been shown [1] that the spinless non-relativistic QED
Hamiltonian describing this system is given by

In general, 0

≤

≤

δ

where

H = H0 + Hint,

H0 = H2particle + Hrad,
Hint = HV + HS + Hsg.

H0 is the Hamiltonian describing the two-particle system (H2particle) and the radiation ﬁeld
(Hrad). Hint describes the interaction between the two–particle system and the radiation
ﬁeld. HV describes the coupling of the radiation to the relative motion and is given by
the usual vector photon type interaction. Hsg is a seagull type interaction responsible
for simultaneous two–photon processes. HS describes the coupling of the radiation to the
c.m. and is given by an eﬀective scalar photon interaction Hamiltonian. Explicitly, the
forms of HV , HS, and Hsg are [1]:

and ǫ is the polarization vector and a(ǫ,k) is the annhiliation operator for the photon.

It has long been accepted that within nonrelativistic QED, a single photon transition
between two S-states (L = 0) is impossible [2]. This readily follows from parity consider-
ation if only the vector interaction is assumed. In [1], the eﬀects of ﬁnite mass correction
on one–photon transitions were studied. Taking into account the induced scalar interac-
tion, it was shown that the metastable 2S state can decay by one–photon emission, which
is otherwise forbidden if the nucleus is taken to be inﬁnitely massive. Being a ﬁnite mass
correction, this one photon decay rate is generally much smaller than the two photon
decay rate. The M1 decay [3], though allowed relativisticaly, is not considered here.

For a self conjugate system with m1 = m2 and Z1 =
Z2, it turns out that this ﬁnite
mass correction eﬀect vanishes in the one–photon decay channel and so the leading eﬀect
of ﬁnite mass correction will appear in two–photon processes. It is the aim of this report
to provide a systematic study of ﬁnite mass eﬀects on two photon processes.

We now give an estimate of the role of the eﬀective scalar photon interaction. For sim-
plicity, we ignore the overall change in the state of the center of mass motion, bearing in
mind that a nonvanishing eﬀective scalar photon interaction requires a nonzero velocity
for the center of mass motion. But in the calculations reported in sections 2 and 3 below,
we do include the eﬀects of the c.m. recoil. As an example, we consider the two–photon

r/2) in both eqns. (4) and (5), we readily observe that
factors exp(
all even electric multipole interactions are totally suppressed in positronium [4]. We now
focus on the dominant decay channels. For the E1 (electric dipole) channel arising from
the vector interaction in (4), the net result as compared to the massive hydrogenic case is
that the electronic mass is replaced by the reduced mass in positronium (a diﬀerence by a
factor of 2). Since the E2 channel is totally suppressed, the next contribution comes from
the E3 channel giving rise to a correction to order α4 (α being the ﬁne structure constant)
to the leading 2E1 decay amplitude. In contrast, on expanding the factor eik·r/2

the eﬀective scalar photon interaction in (5), we see that the leading nonzero interaction

We notice that as far as the atomic coordinate is concerned, the interaction in (8) behaves
like an E1 (electric dipole) interaction whose coupling strength depends on the center of
mass velocity. For comparsion, we also approximate the vector interaction HV of (4) by
its leading E1 interaction:

In this brief report, we consider a general hydrogenic system and study the eﬀect of the
scalar photon interaction HS on the two–photon transition between two S-states (nS to
n′S). Thus, the general matrix element is of the form

photon transition matrix element was only used as a calculational tool and no physical
signiﬁcance was attached to it. The generalization to arbitrary n and n′ can be easily
carried out and the result will be reported in section 2 below. The mixed scalar–vector two
photon transition matrix element has never been studied before. It can also be evaluated
in closed form and will be reported in section 2 below. In section 3, we apply these results
to study the two–photon decay of the metastable 2S state. The angular distribution of
the two–photon decay spectrum is reported.

2 Exact two photon matrix elements

We will see in the following that for a scattering process 1 from (ǫ, k) to (ǫ′, k′), it is useful
to introduce the the following two photon matrix elements:

can be evaluated analytically in closed form. The analytical form of I is given in (31)
below. Then a comparison of (19) and (22), upon noticing the property of tranversality
of the photon, clearly suggests that to generate the needed matrix elements, we need the
simple relations:

Thus, the relations expressed in eqs. (23) and (24) become the keys to generate a scalar

drogenic system with a electron bound to a positive charge Z

The 2S to 1S amplitude MV V was ﬁrst evaluated in [7] within the dipole approximation.
Higher multipole contributions were calculated in [8]. 2

One can substitute these expression into (40) and obtain the exact two photon matrix
elements. However, to illustrate the ﬁnite mass eﬀect, it is enough to do an expansion
and keep results up to ﬁrst order in ∆/M.

2In (48) above, we have corrected some typos in [8]. In [8], the total power of f1 in the ﬁrst (second)
factor of eqn. (7) should be 3 (4) instead of 2 (2); in eqn.(9), it should read x1
x2;
the L.H.S. of eqn. (13) should read y2; the L.H.S. of eqn. (14) should read -y1. In [8], there was an error
(a factor of 2) in one of the terms presented. The correct results are given in (69) and (72) below.

up to order (Zα)2 and ﬁrst order in ∆/M. We have singled out the δ dependence and
g, f, f ′, f ′′ and h′, h′′ are δ independent. Here θ is the correlation angle between the two
photons in the initial rest frame of the decaying system.

The physical origin of these terms are: g corresponds to the two electric dipole transition
without retardation; f corresponds to correction to g to order (Zα)2 due to retardation
eﬀect; f ′, h′ come from the two electric quadrupole transition. f ′ also contains a contribu-
tion coming from the seagull term; f ′′, h′′ include the recoil correction to the lowest order
in ∆/M.

Notice that the electric quadrupole moment vanishes for the positronium and all the
(Zα)2 corrections in (69) arise from ﬁnite mass correction. It is not suprising that d4 = d6

for the positronium if we remember that h′ comes solely from the electric quadrupole
transition and is zero in the present case.

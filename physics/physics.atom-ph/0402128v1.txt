Abstract

Within the framework of the coplanar binary geometry where it is justiﬁed to use
plane wave solutions for the study of the (e, 2e) reaction and in the presence of a circu-
larly polarized laser ﬁeld, we introduce as a ﬁrst step the DVRPWBA1 (Dirac-Volkov
Plane Wave Born Approximation1) where we take into account only the relativistic
dressing of the incident and scattered electrons. Then, we introduce the DVRPWBA2
(Dirac-Volkov Plane Wave Born Approximation2) where we take totally into account the
relativistic dressing of the incident, scattered and ejected electrons. We then compare
the corresponding triple diﬀerential cross sections for laser-assisted ionization of atomic
hydrogen by electron impact both for the non relativistic and the relativistic regime.

1 Introduction

Ehrhardt et al (1969) [1] were the ﬁrst to conduct electron impact ionization experiments in

which the two outgoing electrons are detected in coincidence after angular and energy analysis.

The ﬁrst theoreticians who proposed such type of experiment were Smirnov and Neudachin

(1966) [2]. These experiments now are commonly referred to as (e, 2e). Since then, the (e, 2e)
reaction has been studied extensively in the non relativistic kinematic domain (Camilloni et
al 1972 [3], Weigold et al 1973 [4], van der Wiel 1973 [5], Brion 1975 [6]). All these studies

show that the non relativistic (e,2e) reaction is a very sensitive test of the target electronic

structure and the electron impact ionization reaction mechanism. For the relativistic domain,

the ﬁrst electron impact ionization experiments where conducted by Dangerﬁeld and Spicer

(1975) [7], then by Hoﬀman et al (1979) [8] and by Anholt (1979) [9]. Total cross sections

with relativistic electrons where measured for the K and L shells of heavy elements. Some

theoreticians ( Scoﬃeld 1978 [10], Moiseiwitsch and Stockman [11]) proposed models for total
ionization cross sections. Finally, Fuss et al (1982) [12] proposed a model of an (e, 2e) reaction

they called binary (e, 2e) reaction in which the maximum momentum transfer occurs, that is,

a reaction where the outgoing electrons have equal energy. This type of reaction has been since

then the most successful for probing atomic, molecular and solid state structure. In a report

devoted both to experimental and theoretical developments in the study of relativistic (e, 2e)

processes, Nakel and Whelan (1999) [13] reviewed the goals of these investigations aimed

at gaining a better understanding of inner-shell ionization process by relativistic electrons

up to the highest atomic numbers and probing the quantum mechanical Coulomb problem

in the regime of high energies (up to 500 keV) and strong ﬁelds. With the advent of the

laser ﬁeld, many theoretical models have been proposed [14] mainly in the non relativistic

domain whereas in the relativistic domain we can only quote the work of Reiss (1990) [15]

and that of Crawford and Reiss (1994,1998) [16] who studied the relativistic ionization of

hydrogen (without electron impact) by linearly polarized light. They focused their work on

the calculations of the diﬀerential transition rates and have shown that strong ﬁeld atomic

stabilization is enhanced by relativistic eﬀects.

In this article, we present a theoretical model for the relativistic electronic dressing in

laser-assisted ionization of atomic hydrogen by electron impact with a circularly polarized

laser ﬁeld and in order to check the consistency of our calculations, we begin our study in

absence of the laser ﬁeld. As we devote this analysis to atomic hydrogen, all distorsion eﬀects

mentioned in [13] need not be addressed since the atomic number we deal with is that of

atomic hydrogen, that is Z = 1. It is checked ﬁrst that , in the absence of the laser ﬁeld and

working in the coplanar binary geometry where the kinetic energies of the scattered electron

and the ejected electron are nearly the same, it is justiﬁed to use plane wave solutions for the

study of the (e, 2e) reaction. Indeed, this particular geometry is such that the ejected electron

does not feel the Coulomb inﬂuence of atomic target and can be described by a plane wave in

the non relativistic as well as in the relativistic domain. Then, in the presence of a circularly

polarized laser ﬁeld, we introduce as a ﬁrst step the DVRPWBA1 (Dirac-Volkov Plane Wave

Born Approximation1) where we take into account only the relativistic dressing of the incident

and scattered electrons. It is shown that this approximation introduces an asymmetry in the

description of the scattering process since it does not allow photon exchange between the laser

ﬁeld and the ejected electron and its domain of validity is only restricted to very weak ﬁelds

and non relativistic electron kinetic energy. Then, we introduce the DVRPWBA2 (Dirac-

Volkov Plane Wave Born Approximation2) where we take totally into account the relativistic

dressing of the incident, scattered and ejected electrons.

The organization of this paper is as follows :

in section II, we present the relativistic

formalism of (e, 2e) reaction in absence of the laser ﬁeld RPWBA (Relativistic Plane Wave

Born Approximation) and we compare it in the non relativistic domain with the NRPWBA

(Non Relativistic Plane wave Born Approximation) as well as the NRCBA (Non Relativistic

Coulomb-Born Approximation). In section III, we introduce the DVPWBA1 (Dirac-Volkov

Plane Wave Born Approximation1) . This approximation is introduced as a ﬁrst step.

In

section IV, we introduce the DVPWBA2 (Dirac-Volkov Plane Wave Born Approximation2)

in which we take fully account of the relativistic electronic dressing of the incident, scattered

and ejected electrons. This approximation is more founded on physical grounds since the

ejected electron can also exchange photons (absorption or emission) with the laser ﬁeld. This

more complete description of the incoming and outgoing electrons allows to investigate the

relativistic domain. In section V, we discuss the results we have obtained and we end by a brief

conclusion in Section VI. Throughout this work, atomic units (a.u) are used (¯h = me = e = 1)
where me is the electron mass and TDCS stands for triple diﬀerential cross section.

4 The TDCS in presence of the laser ﬁeld. The DVP-

WBA2

We now take into account the electronic relativistic dressing of all electrons which are described

by Dirac-Volkov plane waves normalized to the volume V . This will give rise to a new trace to

be calculated but it will turn out that taking into account the relativistic electronic dressing

of the ejected electron amounts simply to introduce a new sum on the lB photons that can be
exchanged with the laser ﬁeld. The transition amplitude in the DVPWBA2 is now given by

The diﬀerence between DVPWBA1 and DVPWBA2 is related to the way we choose φf (x2).
Now, the Dirac-Volkov wave function for the ejected electron is such that

in the framework of the NRPWBA2 (where the incident, scattered and ejected electrons are

described by non relativistic Volkov plane waves )

5 Results and discussion

5.1

In absence of the laser ﬁeld

We begin our discussion by the kinematics of the problem. In absence of the laser ﬁeld, there

is no dressing of angular coordinates [22] and we choose a geometry where pi is along the
Oz axis (θi = φi = 0). For the scattered electron, we choose (θf = 45◦, φf = 0) and for the
ejected electron we choose φB = 180◦ and the angle θB varies from 0◦ to 360◦. This is an
angular situation where we have a coplanar geometry. Spin eﬀects are fully included and we

use an exact relativistic description of the electrons and the atomic target. In order to check

the validity of the coplanar binary geometry, we begin ﬁrst by comparing the three TDCSs

(RPWBA, NRPWBA and NRCBA) in the non relativistic domain. In the expression of the
pB), one has to determine the
pB and pi on the

Figure 1: The three TDCSs scaled in units of 10−3 a.u. The solid line represents the non
relativistic TDCS in the Coulomb Born Approximation the long dashed line represents the
corresponding TDCS in the plane wave approximation and the dotted line sketches the rel-
ativistic TDCS in the plane wave approximation. The incident electron kinetic energy is
Ti = 1350 ev and the ejected electron kinetic energy is TB = 574.5 ev

.

In Fig 1, we see that both RPWBA and NRPWBA give nearly the same results whereas

NRCBA gives a higher TDCS due to the fact that the ejected electron still feels the inﬂuence of

the atomic ﬁeld. Increasing this energy of the ejected electron from 574.5 eV to 674.5 eV gives

rise to almost three indistinguishable curves. This situation is shown in Fig 2. As the incident

electron kinetic energy is increased to 2700 eV which corresponds to a relativistic parameter
v2/c2)−1/2 = 1.0053, that of the ejected electron to 1349.5 eV , we have a very good

agreement between the three TDCSs. This is a crucial test for the models we will develop

in the presence of a laser ﬁeld since the adjunction of the latter cannot be done without a

judicious choice of a geometry. It must be borne in mind that this coplanar binary geometry is

not well suited for the study of the domain of low kinetic energy for the ejected electron. The

agreement between these three approaches remains good up to Ti = 15 keV from which the
RPWBA gives results that are a little lower than NRPWBA and NRCBA because relativistic

and spin eﬀects can no longer be ignored. Due to the relative simplicity of the model (even if

the calculations are far from being obvious) and the exact non dressed relativistic description

of the target, it is remarkable that such an agreement should be reached for these energies.

When the laser ﬁeld is introduced, the dressing of angular coordinates is not important for the

non relativistic regime (γ = 1.0053,

= 0.05 a.u) but becomes noticeable for the relativistic

is the electric ﬁeld strength. The unit of electric ﬁeld

regime ( γ = 2.0,

The ﬁrst check to be done is to take a zero electric ﬁeld strength in order to recover all the

results in absence of the laser ﬁeld. We have done these checks for all approximations. It has

been shown [23] that for a laser frequency w = 0.043 a.u, which corresponds to a laser photon

energy of 1.17 eV , dressing eﬀects due to the atomic target are not very important. A complete

12

and exact relativistic treatment of the ejected electron is not analytically possible since the

non relativistic wave equation for continuum states in a Coulomb ﬁeld is separable in parabolic

coordinates, but the corresponding Dirac equation is not. In other words, a decomposition

of the relativistic continuum wave function into partial waves is not as straightforward as for

the non relativistic case and the quantum numbers of each partial wave have to be taken

into account very carefully. However, a tedious numerical construction of the ﬁrst few partial

waves is possible.

We ﬁrst compare the results obtained within the three approximations (DVPWBA1, NR-

PWBA1, NRCBA1) where it is expected on physical grounds that these cannot be used to
study the relativistic regime. The three summed TDCSs are all peaked around θB = 45◦,
φB = 180◦ which was to be expected for the case of the geometry chosen since for the scat-
tered electron, the choice we have made is θf = 45◦, φf = 0◦ and in the xOy plane, this
amounts to a scattered electron and an ejected electron having an opposite value of θ. Even

with no photon exchange and for an electric ﬁeld stregth of 0.05 a.u, the presence of the

laser ﬁeld reduces considerably the magnitude of the TDCSs. The NRPWBA1 and NRCBA1

TDCSs are nearly indistinguishable whereas the DVPWBA1 TDCS is lower than the former
ones in the vicinity of the maximum for θB = 45◦. For this angle, we have TDCS(NRPWBA1)
0.472 10−5 a.u.

We have shown in a previous work [24] that when all electrons are described by Dirac-Volkov

planes, the corresponding diﬀerential cross sections for the absorption and emission (of one

photon) processes are identical. It is not the case for these three approximations since the

ejected electron is described by a free Dirac plane wave. The DVPWBA1 TDCS is larger
than the two other non relativistic TDCSs by a factor 4 at the maximum for θB = 45◦ for
the absorption process and the emission process but these relativistic TDCSs are not identical

. The TDCS for the emission of one photon is smaller than the corresponding one for the

absorption of one photon by a factor 2 at the same maximum. These remarks are not without

interest since a crucial test of our next model ( all electrons are described by Dirac-Volkov

plane waves) will be to compare the two TDCSs within the framework of DVPWBA2 for

these two processes. It will be a sound consistency check of our calculations. In Fig. 3, we

show the three summed TDCSs for an exchange of

100 photons and we obtain close curves

for the non relativistic plane wave and Coulomb Born results with the relativistic plane wave
TDCS a little lower than the former ones in the vicinity of the peak at θB = 45◦. For angles
lower or larger than θB = 45◦, the three TDCSs give nearly the same results. The dressing of

angular coordinates being negligeable, the maximum is maintained for the above mentionned

value of θB but in the relativistic regime, this maximum is shifted. Also, we have compared
100 and
the relativistic TDCS for diﬀerent numbers of photons exchanged, typically

150 photons. The TDCSs increase when the number of the photons exchanged increases

and ﬁnally, we have compared the relativistic TDCS without laser ﬁeld with these summed

relativistic TDCSs in order to obtain a check of the well known pseudo sumrule [25]. We

have obtained results that converge to the relativistic TDCS without laser ﬁeld but complete

convergence is not reached since the ejected electron is not properly described.

Now, we discuss the results obtained within the framework of the three more accurate

approximations (DVPWBA2, NRPWBA2, NRCBA2) in the same non relativistic regime.

The description of the ejected electron by a Dirac-Volkov plane wave being more accurate and

necessary on physical grounds (there are no constraints that forbid the ejected electron to

exchange photons with the laser ﬁeld), we have ﬁrst investigated the case where no photon is

exchanged at all (s = 0, lB = 0). There is a shift of the location for the maximum corresponding
to the relativistic TDCS while the two non relativistic TDCSs are nearly the same. The

0.347
magnitude of the TDCSs is also considerably reduced. We have TDCS(DVRPWBA2)
10−8 a.u for θB = 41◦ while TDCS(NRPWBA2)
0.3326 10−8 a.u for
θB = 43◦. There are three small secondary peaks for the relativistic TDCS and two secondary
peaks for the two non relativistic TDCSs.This behaviour stems in the relativistic description

TDCS(NRCBA2)

from the contribution of the sum over the spins of the ejected electron. This sum shows a

14

narrow peak for θB = 41◦ and presents two minima for θB = 45◦ and θB = 50◦. The other peaks
can also be traced back to the behaviour of this sum. Relativistic and spin eﬀects begin at this

stage to become noticeable since the shift as well as the magnitude of the relativistic TDCS

with respect to the non relativistic TDCSs are clear signatures even in the non relativistic

regime.

Moreover, the most crucial test of our model is the complete symmetry between the emis-

sion and absorption processes. In Fig. 4, we show the relativistic and non relativistic TDCSs

For these two curves, the maximum shifts back to the value θB = 45◦. As the number of

on the location of the maximum. The summed TDCSs for (s =

(s =

100, lB =

s = lB. All curves are peaked around a maximum angle due to the behaviour of the square
of the Fourier transform of the relativistic hydrogenic wave functions that falls oﬀ rapidly to

±

zero in a small region around this maximum. Another interesting remark concerns once again

the behaviour of the sum over the spins of the ejected electron with the number of photons

exchanged. As l

500, this sum is almost zero and contributes also to the rapid fall oﬀ of

the corresponding relativistic TDCS. To illustrate the complexity of the location of the visual

cut-oﬀ of the relativistic TDCS, we consider an electric ﬁeld strength

= 0.01 a.u where it

is expected that the numbers s and l of photons exchanged will not be high. The envelope of

E

photon energy transfer obtained is a curve in three dimensions. As in the case of the process

of Mott scattering in a strong laser ﬁeld, we observe in Fig. 5

converging envelope, one has to sum over the same numbers s and l of photons exchanged.

E

In the relativistic regime, dressing of angular coordinates is not negligeable and we indeed
observed as in the case of excitation a shift from θB = 45◦ to lower values. The relativistic
parameter γ = 2 corresponds to an incident electron kinetic energy of c2 in atomic units or
the rest mass of the electron (0.511 MeV ). In Fig 6, we show the behaviour of the relativistic

TDCS in absence of a laser ﬁeld in order to have an idea about the reduction of the corre-
sponding TDCS when the laser ﬁeld is introduced. The maximum is well located at θB = 40◦
0.54 10−15 a.u. For this
and at this value, we have for the corresponding TDCS(RPWBA)
regime and in presence of a strong laser ﬁeld, the non relativistic TDCSs are no longer reliable

≃

and we will focus instead on the discussion of the results obtained within the DVPWBA1

and DVPWBA2. For the DVPWBA1, we ﬁrst analyzed what happens when no photon is

exchanged. There is a drastic reduction of the TDCS with a maximum shifted for θB lower
0.5 10−21
than 40◦ and at this value, we have for the corresponding TDCS(DVPWBA1)

but we have a TDCS that increases when the number of the photons exchanged increases. For

the DVPWBA2, there is also a considerable reduction of the TDCS for s = lB = 0. In Fig

5.3 Conclusion

In this work, we have investigated the contribution of the relativistic electronic dressing in

laser-assisted ionization of atomic hydrogen by electronic impact using the Dirac-Volkov plane

wave solutions to describe the incoming and the two outgoing electrons. We have worked in

the binary coplanar geometry where the description of the ejected electron by a relativistic

Coulomb wave function is not necessary. The inﬂuence of the laser ﬁeld is taken into account to

all orders in the Dirac-Volkov description of electrons and the description of the atomic target

used is the analytical relativistic hydrogenic wave functions. It turns out that all the TDCSs

are well peaked around a maximum angle due to the behaviour of the Fourier transforms of

the relativistic hydrogenic wave functions. Symmetry between the absorption and emission

processes is obtained when all electrons are described by Dirac-Volkov plane waves both for

the non relativistic and relativistic regime.

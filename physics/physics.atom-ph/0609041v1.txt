A self-oscillating magnetometer based on the nonlinear magneto-optical rotation eﬀect with sep-
arate modulated pump and unmodulated probe beams is demonstrated. This device possesses a
bandwidth exceeding 1 kHz. Pump and probe are delivered by optical ﬁber, facilitating minia-
turization and modularization. The magnetometer has been operated both with vertical-cavity
surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), which are well suited to portable applications, and with conven-
tional edge-emitting diode lasers. A sensitivity of around 3 nG is achieved for a measurement time
of 1 s.

INTRODUCTION

Polarizers

Considerable progress has been made in recent years in
atomic magnetometry, including the achievement of sub-
femtotesla sensitivity [1], the application of coherent dark
states to magnetometry [2, 3], development of sensitive
atomic magnetometers for biological applications [4, 5]
and for fundamental physics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], the in-
troduction of chip-scale atomic magnetometers [12], and
the development of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation
(NMOR) using modulated light [13] with its subsequent
demonstration in the geomagnetic ﬁeld range [14]. An
important potential application is to space-based mea-
surements, including measurements of planetary ﬁelds,
of the solar-wind current, and of magnetic ﬁelds in deep
space [15]. As these sensitive magnetometric techniques
move from the laboratory to applications in the ﬁeld and
in space, signiﬁcant new demands will naturally be placed
on their robustness, size, weight, and power consumption.
An attractive approach that addresses many of these de-
mands is the self-oscillating magnetometer conﬁguration,
originally proposed by Bloom [16]. In this conﬁguration,
the detected optical signal at the Larmor frequency or
a harmonic, is used to drive the magnetic resonance, ei-
ther with RF coils or, as in the present work, by optical
excitation of the resonance. When this resonant drive
is ampliﬁed suﬃciently, the oscillation builds up spon-
taneously (seeded by noise) at the resonant frequency.
The spontaneous nature of the oscillation obviates the
necessity of slow preliminary scans, which would other-
wise be required to search for the resonance and lock to
the desired line. Moreover, the size, weight, and power
consumption of a self-oscillating device all beneﬁt from
the simpliﬁcation of the electronics that results from not
requiring a local oscillator or lock-in ampliﬁer.

FIG. 1: Diagram of experimental setup. The output of
a diode laser is split into pump and probe beams. The
laser is frequency-stabilized approximately 300 MHz below the
center of the 87Rb D2 Doppler-broadened line center via a
dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL). The pump beam is
amplitude-modulated by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM).
Both pump and probe are delivered by optical ﬁber to a
paraﬃn-coated vapor cell. Separate polarizers allow indepen-
dent control of pump and probe polarization. The polariza-
tion rotation of the probe beam is analyzed in a balanced
polarimeter consisting of a Rochon polarizer followed by a
pair of photodiodes and an ampliﬁer. A zero-crossing detec-
tor (Schmitt trigger) and pulser control the pump power via
the AOM, closing the loop and sustaining self-oscillation. In
an alternate conﬁguration, separate VCSELs on the 87Rb D1
F=2 line supplied light for pump and probe.

A self-oscillating magnetometer based on NMOR was
recently reported by Schwindt et al. [17], in whose work
the functions of pumping and probing were fulﬁlled by a
single frequency-modulated laser beam. As a result, the
detected signal was a product both of the rotating atomic
alignment and of the modulated detuning, resulting in
a complicated waveform that required signiﬁcant elec-
tronic processing before being suitable for feeding back

to the laser modulation, as required in the self-oscillating
scheme.

In the present paper, we present a simple alternative
arrangement that avoids many of the diﬃculties encoun-
tered in the single-beam experiment. Indeed, by the use
of two laser beams–a modulated pump and an unmodu-
lated probe–the optical-rotation signal may be made ac-
curately sinusoidal, avoiding the complexity of digital or
other variable-frequency ﬁlters in the feedback loop. Im-
portantly, the use of two beams also permits optical ad-
justment of the relative phase of the detected signal and
the driving modulation by changing the angle between
their respective linear polarizations. For magnetometry
at large bias ﬁeld and requiring a wide range of ﬁelds,
this optical tuning of the feedback-loop phase promises
both good long-term stability and much greater unifor-
mity with respect to frequency than can readily be ob-
tained with an electronic phase shift.

II. NMOR RESONANCE

Detailed discussions of zero-ﬁeld NMOR resonances
[13, 18], as well as of the additional ﬁnite-ﬁeld resonances
that occur when the pumping laser light is frequency-
modulated (FM) [19] or amplitude-modulated (AM) [20],
have been presented in prior work. An NMOR reso-
nance occurs when optical pumping causes an atomic
vapor to become dichroic (or birefringent), so that subse-
quent probe light experiences polarization rotation. For
the resonances considered in this work, both pump and
probe are linearly polarized and therefore primarily pro-
duce and detect atomic alignment (∆m = 2 coherences).
The magnetic-ﬁeld dependence originates from the fact
that the atomic spins undergo Larmor precession, so that
weak optical pumping can only produce a macroscopic
alignment when the Larmor precession frequency is small
compared to the spin relaxation rate, or alternatively
when pumping is nearly synchronous with precession, as
in FM or AM NMOR.

If the optical-pumping rate is modulated at a frequency
ν, then the optical-rotation angle of the probe polariza-
tion will in general also oscillate at frequency ν. If this
frequency is scanned across the resonance (in open-loop
conﬁguration, i.e. with no feedback from the optical-
rotation signal), then the NMOR resonance will manifest
itself as a resonant peak in the rotation-angle amplitude
of the probe polarization on the output. Assuming the
in-going probe and pump polarizations to be parallel, the
amplitude and phase of the observed rotation signal can

be described by the complex Lorentzian (δ
where δ
2νL) is the detuning from resonance, γ
is the full width (in modulation frequency) at half max-
imum of the resonance, and νL is the Larmor frequency.
The phase shift relative to the pump modulation as a
function of δ is seen by taking the argument of this com-

The experimental apparatus,

300 MHz below the center of the F = 2

shown schematically
in Fig. 1,
consists of a cylindrical paraﬃn-coated
87Rb vapor cell 2 cm in diameter and length traversed by
linearly-polarized pump and probe laser beams. These
beams were supplied by a single external-cavity diode
laser on the D2 line of rubidium, frequency-stabilized

Doppler-broadened line by means of a dichroic atomic
vapor laser lock [21, 22]. The probe beam was left un-
modulated, while the pump was amplitude modulated
with an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Pump and
probe were delivered to the cell by separate polarization-
maintaining ﬁbers. After exiting the cell, the pump beam
was blocked and the probe analyzed by a balanced po-
larimeter consisting of a Rochon polarizing beam-splitter
and a pair of photodiodes. The diﬀerence photocurrent
was ampliﬁed with a low-noise transimpedance ampliﬁer
(Stanford Research Model SR570) and passed through
a resonant LC ﬁlter centered at 20 kHz with a band-
width of 11 kHz, much wider than either the NMOR reso-
nance (
80 Hz) or the desired magnetometer bandwidth
1 kHz). This ﬁlter reduced jitter in the frequency-
(
∼
counter readings, but is not necessary in principle. The
pump modulation was derived from this ampliﬁed signal,
closing the feedback loop, by triggering a pulse gener-
ator on the negative-going zero-crossings of the signal,
and allowing these pulses to switch on and oﬀ the ra-
diofrequency power delivered to the AOM. The pulse
duty cycle was approximately 15%. For characterization
of the magnetometer in the laboratory, the vapor cell
was placed in a three-layer cylindrical magnetic shield,
provided with internal coils for the generation of a sta-
ble, well-deﬁned magnetic bias ﬁeld and gradients. The
87Rb density in the cell was maintained at an elevated

The photodiode signal was monitored with an oscillo-
scope and a frequency counter (Stanford Research Model
SR620). Provided the trigger threshold of the pulse gen-
erator was close enough to zero (i.e. within a few times
the noise level of the signal), oscillation would occur
spontaneously when the loop was closed at a frequency
set by the magnetic ﬁeld. Optimum settings for the mag-
netometer sensitivity were found to be approximately
7 µW mean incident pump power, 7 µW continuous inci-
dent probe power, and optical absorption of around 60%

at the lock point. A sensitivity of 3 nG was achieved for
a measurement time of 1 s at these settings, as discussed
in detail in section VII.

∼

Several alternative conﬁgurations were also imple-
mented. In place of the balanced polarimeter described
above, a conﬁguration consisting of a polarizer nearly
orthogonal to the unrotated probe polarization followed
by a large-area avalanche photodiode (APD) module was
employed. This conﬁguration has high detection band-
width, but suﬀers from lower common-mode noise rejec-
tion and greater sensitivity to stray light. Moreover, the
excess noise factor of the APD module prevents attain-
ing shot-noise-limited operation. With the APD mod-
ule, self-oscillation at frequencies up to
1 MHz was
achieved.
In another conﬁguration, frequency modula-
tion of the pump laser was employed. This conﬁguration
worked well, but the laser frequency lock point was found
to depend subtly on the state of self-oscillation of the
magnetometer. For this reason, it was found preferable
to employ amplitude modulation of the pump laser via an
external modulator following the light pick oﬀ for laser
frequency stabilization. The magnetometer has moreover
been operated with two separate vertical-cavity surface-
emitting diode lasers (VCSELs) as pump and probe on
the D1 line of rubidium. The low power requirements,
small size, and reliable tuning of VCSELs render them
appealing for use in miniaturized and portable magne-
tometers. Amplitude modulation has also been per-
formed with an inline ﬁber-optic Mach-Zehnder interfero-
metric modulator, which permits further miniaturization
and considerably reduced power consumption relative to
the acousto-optic modulator.

IV. OPTICAL PHASE SHIFT

To emphasize the advantages of the two-beam arrange-
ment for the optical adjustment of the phase shift, we
note that optical pumping by linearly polarized light fa-
vors the preparation of a state whose alignment sym-
metry axis is parallel to the pump polarization. At the
center of the NMOR resonance, therefore, where there is
no phase lag between pumping and precession, the pre-
cessing axis of atomic alignment is parallel to the pump
polarization at the moment of maximal optical pumping
in the limit of short pump pulses. Consequently, if the
probe polarization is parallel to the pump polarization,
the probe polarization rotation signal will pass through
zero at the same moment, so that this optical rotation
signal is 90◦ out of phase with the pump modulation, as
seen in Eq. (1). Thus the rotation signal must be shifted
90◦ before being fed back as pump modulation in
by
order for coherent buildup at the central resonant fre-
quency to occur. Deviations from this phase shift will
result in oscillation away from line center, in such a way
as to maintain zero total phase around the loop, so long
as the magnitude of the gain is suﬃcient to sustain os-
cillation at the shifted frequency. As a result, precise

control over this phase shift as a function of frequency
is required to avoid (or compensate for) systematic de-
viations of the oscillation frequency from 2ωL as a func-
tion of magnetic ﬁeld. Analog ﬁlter networks capable
of generating accurate and stable 90◦ phase shifts over a
broad range of frequencies are diﬃcult to construct. Dig-
ital phase shifters, although feasible, add complexity and
power consumption and risk degradation of performance.

The use of separate pump and probe beams oﬀers
a natural and all-optical means of shifting the relative
phase between modulation and optical rotation. Indeed,
since the rotation of the probe polarization is determined
by the angle of the incident polarization with respect to
the axis of atomic alignment, which itself rotates uni-
formly in time, a ﬁxed rotation of the incoming probe
polarization is equivalent to a translation in time of the
output signal, i.e., a phase shift. Since this phase shift
is purely geometrical, it has no frequency dependence,
and possesses the long-term stability of the mechanical

To demonstrate the optical phase shift of

the
polarization-rotation signal, a measurement of the phase
shift of the signal as a function of the pump polarizer
angle was performed in the open-loop conﬁguration, i.e.,
with an external frequency source modulating the pump
power and with no feedback of the optical-rotation sig-
nal. The resulting curve reveals the expected linear de-
pendence, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The observed slope
is consistent with the value of 2 expected from the fact
that the optical-rotation signal undergoes two cycles as
the atomic alignment rotates by 360◦. The eﬀects of a
phase shift in the feedback network on the oscillation fre-
quency of the self-oscillating, closed-loop magnetometer
are shown in Fig. 2(b). As expected, the magnetometer
adjusts its oscillation frequency so that the phase shift of
the NMOR resonance cancels that of the feedback net-
work. Since the phase shift of the NMOR resonance is
an arctangent function of the detuning from resonance
(similar to a damped harmonic oscillator), this results in
a change in oscillation frequency which is proportional
to the tangent of the applied phase shift, as seen in Fig.
2(b).

FIG. 4: Heterodyne measurement of magnetometer response
to a ﬁeld step. Shown here is the self-oscillating rotation sig-
nal mixed down to low frequency by a lock-in ampliﬁer with
its reference set to approximately twice the Larmor frequency.
This heterodyned signal is shown for a period of approxi-
mately 40 ms during which a sudden change of ≈ 250 µG is
made to the bias magnetic ﬁeld. The local oscillator is set
midway between the two oscillation frequencies, so that the
heterodyne signal appears to reverse itself in time.

signal was demodulated by a lock-in ampliﬁer at this ref-
erence frequency (or one of its harmonics). On the ba-
sis of the lock-in output, the reference frequency could
be updated at a rate governed by the lock-in time con-
stant, in order to maintain the resonance condition in a
slowly changing magnetic ﬁeld. By contrast, in the self-
oscillating scheme, the measured rotation signal is fed
back to the modulation input in place of the reference
frequency, as shown in Fig. 1. In order to reproduce self-
consistently the eﬀects of an external modulation, this
signal must in general be phase shifted and ﬁltered so
that it closely resembles the original reference frequency,
as in the work of Ref. [17].

Indeed,

if the probe is frequency- or amplitude-
modulated, as is the case for a single-beam experiment,
then the observed rotation signal will be the product
of the rotation signal that would be observed with an
unmodulated probe and a function which describes the
modulation. In the case of frequency modulation, for ex-
ample, the observed rotation signal for an isolated line,
Doppler broadened to a width ∆νDoppler, would be ap-
proximately

φun.(t)e

≈

−(δ0−A cos 2πνmodt)2/∆ν2

Doppler ,

where φun. is the rotation that would be observed by an
unmodulated probe passing through the same sample,
δ0 is the mean detuning of the laser from resonance, A
the modulation amplitude, and νmod the modulation fre-
quency. Similarly, in the case of pulsed amplitude modu-
lation, the multiplicative modulation function would take
the form of a pulse train at the modulation frequency.
Since the atomic alignment is described by a rank 2
spherical tensor, and the corresponding spin probabil-

ity distribution is two-fold symmetric (see, for example,
Ref. [23]), the unmodulated rotation signal is to good
approximation sinusoidal at twice the Larmor frequency,
2ωL.
(Note that this argument neglects the eﬀects of
alignment-to-orientation conversion [24], which becomes
important at relatively large light powers.) The over-all
rotation signal detected by a modulated probe, however,
is in general highly non-sinusoidal. For stable and repro-
ducible operation, such a signal would almost certainly
require ﬁltering, which generically introduces undesirable
phase shifts.
In contrast, the use of an unmodulated
probe avoids this complication altogether. The detected
rotation signal is a near-perfect sinusoid (measurements
indicate that the higher harmonics are down by more
than 50 dB). Such a signal requires only ampliﬁcation to
make it mimic the reference oscillator.

VI. HIGH-SPEED RESPONSE

In order to assess the bandwidth of the magnetome-
ter, the response to rapid changes in magnetic ﬁeld was
investigated by applying a small modulation to the bias
magnetic ﬁeld. In one measurement, a slow square-wave
modulation was superimposed on the bias ﬁeld via a sepa-
rate Helmholtz coil inside the magnetic shield. The self-
oscillation signal was then recorded on an oscilloscope
and ﬁt in each 500 µs window to a sinusoid, with the
results shown in Fig. 3. Tracking of the ﬁeld step is
quasi-instantaneous, without apparent overshoot or ring-
ing. The magnetometer response was also monitored by
heterodyning the oscillation frequency with a ﬁxed ref-
erence frequency on a lock-in ampliﬁer, with the lock-in
time constant set to approximately the oscillation pe-
riod (
50 µs) to remove the sum-frequency component.
The resulting low-frequency beat signal, which displayed
large fractional frequency modulation, was also digitized
and recorded on an oscilloscope. Inspection of the wave-
forms so obtained revealed the same sudden shift in the
oscillation frequency as the magnetic ﬁeld toggled be-
tween values (see Fig. 4). In a related experiment, the
bias ﬁeld received a small sinusoidal modulation, and the
power spectrum of the self-oscillation waveform was ob-
served on a spectrum analyzer. The sidebands were ob-
served, oﬀset from the oscillation (carrier) frequency by
an amount equal to this bias-modulation frequency; their
relative power was equal to that expected if the oscilla-
tor tracked the changing magnetic ﬁeld with no delay or
diminution of amplitude out to a bias-modulation fre-
quency of at least 1 kHz.

surement time. The self-oscillating magnetometer is sim-
ilar in many respects to a maser, as was ﬁrst pointed out
in Ref. [16]; a treatment of noise in the hydrogen maser
system is given in Ref. [25]. The read-out device envi-
sioned here is a frequency counter that measures to high
precision the elapsed time between two zero-crossings of
the rotation signal and reports a frequency which is the
integer number of zero-crossings divided by this time.

Noise in the magnetometer readings comes from sev-
eral sources. These include fundamental noise, such as
atomic and photon shot noise, as well as technical noise
from electronics. Fluctuations in the measured ﬁeld also
appear as noise, but do not represent a failing of the
magnetometer. For a transmitted probe beam power of
P = 2.5 µW, the optical shot noise for an ideal polarime-

ter, given in terms of the photon energy Eph by
is 1.1 pW/√ Hz or 0.55 pA/√ Hz in terms of the diﬀeren-
tial photocurrent noise. Atomic shot noise is expected to
contribute a comparable noise level for an optimized mag-
netometer [26]. Observed ampliﬁer noise is somewhat
larger than the photon shot-noise level, or 0.8 pA/√ Hz,
and can be considered as white noise over the relevant
bandwidth (> 5 kHz) around the operation frequency of
20 kHz. For comparison, the optimized self-oscillation
signal amplitude, hereafter denoted I0, is 14 nA.

p

Noise contributes to the uncertainty in the measure-
ment of the self-oscillation frequency in two essential
ways. First, it imparts random shifts to the times of the
signal zero-crossings, resulting in jitter of the frequency-
counter trigger times and of the corresponding reported
frequency. Second, noise within the NMOR resonance
bandwidth drives the atomic resonance, resulting in ran-
dom drifts of the phase of oscillation and limiting the
precision of the frequency measurement. We will con-
sider each of these in turn, both for the observed noise
level and for the photon-shot-noise limit.

Jitter of the counter triggers can be derived from a

photocurrent diﬀerence signal

I(t) = I0 sin(2πν0t) + ∆I(t).

Here, ∆I(t) is additive noise, e.g., photon shot noise
or ampliﬁer noise, referred to the ampliﬁer input, i.e.,
expressed as a photocurrent, and ν0 is the mean self-
oscillation frequency. Provided that ∆I(t) is small, the
zero-crossings of this signal experience a r.m.s. ﬂuctua-
tion

∆tzero =

∆Irms
2πν0I0

.

If the open-loop noise spectrum is approximately white
in the vicinity of ν0, then the r.m.s. current is simply
given by ∆Irms = √2SIνmax, where 2νmax is the band-
width around ν0 deﬁned, for instance, by a ﬁlter in the
loop, and SI is the single-sided current power spectral
density, with units of A2
rms/ Hz. The r.m.s. deviation
of the interval between two zero crossings ∆tmeas is √2
times the deviation of each separately, so that the total
uncertainty in the frequency reading of the magnetome-
ter due to trigger jitter is

∆νjitt = ν0∆tmeas/T
(SI νmax)1/2
πT I0

where T is the measurement duration.

The second eﬀect of noise on the operation of the mag-
netometer is due to the feedback network that produces
self-oscillation. As shown below, noise that is within the
linewidth of the NMOR resonance mimics a ﬂuctuat-
ing phase shift in the self-oscillating loop. This phase
shift produces random ﬂuctuations in the oscillation fre-
quency, inducing diﬀusion of the over-all phase of oscil-
lation. For notational simplicity, let us ﬁrst consider a
single frequency component of the noise at a frequency
ν0 + νoﬀ , where νoﬀ is referred to as the oﬀset frequency.
For an open-loop magnetometer, i.e., with modulation
supplied by an external frequency source tuned to the
NMOR resonance and no feedback of the optical rota-
tion signal, the resulting photocurrent diﬀerence signal
would be

I(t) = I0 sin(2πν0t) + ǫ sin(2π(ν0 + νoﬀ )t)

where ǫ is taken to be small, and a term contributing only
to amplitude modulation of the signal has been neglected.
The phase of the noise component has been chosen arbi-
trarily but plays no role in what follows. Equation (4)
shows that the eﬀect of this noise component is to modu-

ǫ/I0 at frequency νoﬀ . When the self-oscillating loop
is closed, the oscillation responds to this noise-induced
phase shift by shifting the frequency of oscillation in such

a way as to keep the net phase shift around the loop zero.
The magnitude of the resulting frequency modulation of
the self-oscillating signal is readily calculated from Eq.
(1), which may be approximated over the central por-
γφ/4π, so that

Although this expression diverges for νoﬀ →
a measurement lasting a time T imposes an eﬀective low-
frequency cut-oﬀ of
1/T . To take into account the fact
that the noise contains many incoherent spectral compo-
nents, rather than a single monochromatic component,
one must add these components in quadrature. Thus, it
is suﬃcient to replace the original mean square current
modulation ǫ2/2 at frequency νoﬀ , by the photocurrent

The photocurrent noise spectrum SI has been assumed
white over the range of integration in evaluating the in-
tegral.

This intra-resonance noise can also be understood in
terms of phase diﬀusion [27]. Indeed, although the fre-
quency of the oscillation is stabilized to twice the Larmor

frequency in the self-oscillating scheme, the global phase
of oscillation experiences no feedback or restoring force,
and is thus subject to an eﬀective Brownian motion or
diﬀusion, where shot noise or ampliﬁer noise provides a
stochastic driving force. In this picture, the phase un-
dergoes a random walk, with a step size given by the
r.m.s. noise within the resonance and a time step given
1/γ. Explicitly, the total phase noise within the
by
resonance yields a step size ∆φstep ≈
γ/2π.
After a time T the number of steps is approximately

It should be noted that the initial 1/T dependence of
the sensitivity is non-optimal. If information about the
phase during the entire duration T were retained and
the frequency extracted (e.g. by least-squares ﬁtting),
then this dependence could be improved by an addi-
Tsamp/T , where Tsamp
tional factor of approximately

cient to outweigh the frequency counter’s considerable
convenience. The result of Eq. (9) is within a factor of
two of the optical-shot-noise limit for the same system
parameters, although with a quieter photodiode ampli-
ﬁer, further optimization of light powers, detunings, and
87Rb density should permit operation with narrower res-
onance lines and considerable consequent improvement.

sources of noise not present in the model discussed so far
become dominant, obscuring the phase-diﬀusion noise.
In order to distinguish between magnetic and instrumen-
tal noise, we have measured ﬂuctuations of ambient mag-
netic ﬁelds with a ﬂuxgate magnetometer external to the
shields at approximately 20 µG/√ Hz above a 1/f cor-
ner frequency of approximately 0.3 Hz. With a measured

105, this implies a negligibly small
shielding factor of 3
white magnetic-ﬁeld noise of around 70 pG/√ Hz at the
vapor cell. The expected average noise on the supplied
bias ﬁeld inside the shield is better than 6 nG/√ Hz be-
tween 0.1 Hz and 100 Hz. This value is of the same or-
der of magnitude as the observed Allan deviation ﬂoor,
although direct and reliable measurements of this bias
current have not been achieved. Noise on the bias-ﬁeld
current could be distinguished from other sources by use
of a magnetic gradiometer (see, for example, a description
of a gradiometer based on a pair of FM NMOR sensors
in Ref. [28]), though the small size of our magnetic shield
has so far precluded such a measurement.

Other noise sources include sensitivities of the oscilla-
tion frequency to laser powers and detuning. A sensi-
tivity to pump or probe power arises, for instance, when
the feedback-network phase shift deviates from the value
which produces maximal oscillation amplitude. Since the
NMOR phase shift depends on the resonance line width
as in Eq. (1), while the line width depends on optical
power through the eﬀect of power-broadening, changes in
pump or probe power produce changes in phase shift and
corresponding deviations of the self-oscillation frequency.
This eﬀect vanishes to ﬁrst order precisely on the NMOR
resonance; additional mechanisms for translating power
and detuning ﬂuctuations into oscillation-frequency ﬂuc-
tuations are currently being investigated.

VIII. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated a self-oscillating two-beam
magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto-optical ro-
tation and shown that the independent adjustment of
pump and probe polarizations provides a powerful and
frequency-independent means of supplying the phase
shift necessary for self-oscillation. Moreover, the use of
an unmodulated probe eliminates the necessity of elabo-
rate ﬁltering procedures, producing instead a clean sine
wave suitable for feeding back as the self-modulation sig-
nal. The resulting device possesses a high bandwidth
and a measured sensitivity of 3 nG at 1 s. Considerable
improvement, approaching the fundamental atomic and
optical shot-noise limit of > 30 pG in 1 s measurement
6 cm3 cell, is expected through a more thor-
time for a
ough control of light-power-dependent, laser-frequency-
dependent, and electronic phase shifts, as well as through
re-optimization using a quieter ampliﬁer. The funda-
mental constituents of this magnetometer are small and
lightweight, lending themselves well to designs for the
ﬁeld and for space. Operation in the geomagnetic range
of ﬁelds has been achieved. In future work, the robust-
ness of the magnetometer in an unshielded environment
and an arbitrarily directed geomagnetic ﬁeld will be in-
vestigated. Performance in the presence of splitting of
the resonance line by the quadratic Zeeman shift will
also be evaluated.

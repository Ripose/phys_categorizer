Abstract

The states of hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n

3 and zero magnetic quan-
are considered. The coeﬃcients of energy
tum number in constant homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
H
2 are obtained for these states. The series for
eigenvalues expansion up to 75th order in powers of
values of the order of atomic magnetic
energy eigenvalues and wave functions are summed up to
ﬁeld. The calculations are based on generalization of the moment method, which may be used in
other cases of the hydrogen atom perturbation by a polynomial in coordinates potential.

The moment method for high orders of the perturbation theory evaluation, possessing additional
possibilities as compared with the other known recurrent methods, was introduced in Ref.
[2]. It
was described as an expedient for dimensional expansion investigation — in a problem leading to
eﬀective isotropic anharmonic oscillator. Then it was applied to dimensional expansion for three
body problem [3], where the eﬀective anharmonic oscillator is anisotropic.

We turn our attention to the fact, that the perturbation of the hydrogen atom by a potential of
polynomial form is also convenient to investigate by the moment method. The constant homoge-
neous electric and magnetic ﬁelds are referred just to this kind of perturbations. The advantages of
the moment method are clearly seen in the Zeeman eﬀect problem. High orders of the perturbation
theory (PT) using diﬀerent approaches were studied in Refs. [4-6]. The method, based on the group
theory was applied. 36 coeﬃcients of the hydrogen’s ground state energy expansion in powers of

the third order in
Zeeman eﬀect can not be separated and it makes computation of higher PT orders more diﬃcult.
The moment method does not require variables separation. Besides, as it will be shown here, this
method can be applied to degenerate states. Obviously this possibility is essential for most of the
hydrogen atom states.

Apparently the logarithmic perturbation theory (LPT) was most frequently used for recurrent
evaluation of PT coeﬃcients up to now [11-15]. Owing to its simple algebraic structure, LPT
allowed to compute the highest orders corrections for some cases. Thus, for the Stark shift of
the hydrogen ground state 160 orders of PT were obtained this way [16]. But LPT is not free
from restrictions. Even one node of the wave function leads to considerable more complicated
computation procedure [17]. Much more complicated LPT looks in problems, where variables can
not be separated. Without variables separation only a few initial PT orders were computed with
the help of LPT for the hydrogen atom in electric and magnetic ﬁelds [9,10,14].

It is also worth mentioning here the old PT version, based on the generalized virial and
[18,19]
Hellmann–Feynman theorems, which anticipated the modern moment method.
recurrence relations were written for problems with spherical symmetry, allowing to compute en-
ergy eigenvalues corrections for states with nodes in as simple way as for nodeless states. But the
moments introduced in these papers were diagonal ones and that is why the region of applicability of

In Refs.

the method is restricted. For instance, in this formalism it is impossible to obtain the corresponding
wave function.

The recurrence relations of the Ader moment method will be obtained below. Two examples
illustrate their applications: one is referred to non-degenerate state and the other to the case
of degeneracy. Then the asymptotic of the numerically obtained energy expansion coeﬃcients is
considered and the results of summation of perturbation series are given. It will be shown on example
of the ground state, how the wave function of the perturbed hydrogen atom can be obtained within
the moment method.

The right-hand side of Eq. (4) contains moments only of preceding orders. The Ek coeﬃcient,
which we call the hyper-susceptibility of the order k, can also be expressed through the preceding
orders moments. This expression follows from (4) and will be written down below, separately for
each of the cases under investigation.

Quite similar it is possible to consider another perturbation of the same state, if this perturbation
has the form of a polynomial in r and z. It is enough to change only the right-hand side of Eq.
(4) for this aim. The expression in brackets in the right-hand side, representing the magnetic ﬁeld
contribution, should be replaced by another function of the preceding orders moments, created by
the new perturbation.

The succession of the based on relation (4) computations becomes more lucid if one represents
on a plot the lattice of points with integer coordinates of columns σ and rows ν. The indices of
moments, necessary to compute energy and wave function corrections, are placed on this lattice in
0. In the general case Eq. (4) relates moments of the order k, indices

vertex appears to be on the line σ = ν
1 and another one is outside the above indicated sector,
the triangle (example A) transforms into segment (example B), and Eq. (4) turns into relation
between two moments from diﬀerent rows. Equation (4) relates moments in pairs also along each of
the lines with ν = 0 and ν = 1 (examples C and D). At k = 0, as the direct integration indicates,

3. ISOLATED STATES

Magnetic ﬁeld does not mix states with diﬀerent parities, therefore besides the ground state,
2s-, 2p- and 3p-states should also be considered as non-degenerate. Let us show, how the moment
method works in the last case. Only the moments with odd ν values can be diﬀerent from zero. In

the sequence of computations is arranged as follows. First, the coeﬃcient Ek is evaluated with the
help of (7). On the next step ν = 1 and σ = 3 are substituted into recurrence relation (4). In
this case together with orthogonality condition (6) it forms a system of equations from which initial
elements of the row of moments with ν = 1 are obtained:

There are two independent ways for expressing hyper-susceptibility Ek through preceding orders
moments.

a) Equation (4) at ν = 0 and σ = 0 determines the moment P k

of P 0

it is not diﬃcult to compute successively all necessary moments of the given order, passing line by

Quite similar, it is possible to accomplish the computation for a state with arbitrary n value
and zero projection of angular momentum. The unperturbed wave function has deﬁnite parity and
contains g degenerate in energy terms. Therefore g

enter the zero order moments. There are two groups of moments in every order k

For all levels with n

3 and m = 0 with the help of the moment method we have obtained
Zeeman’s hyper-susceptibilities Ek up to 75th order, see Table 1. All computations were carried
[8] and Ref.
out with 32 decimal digits. Complete agreement is observed with the results of Ref.
[7], containing ﬁrst ﬁve coeﬃcients Ek for the ground state and three initial coeﬃcients for both
2s- and 2p-states in the form of rational fractions. In Ref.
[9] a diﬀerence was detected between
the obtained in this work expression for E2 coeﬃcient and its value at l = 1 in Ref.
[7]. This
deviation is conﬁrmed. As it follows from expression of Ref. [9], E(2p)

calculations and contains a comparison of a large number of previous computations. The precision
of PS summation with the help of Pad´e approximants is high enough. At γ
1 for 2s- and 3p-states
three or four stable digits of energy eigenvalue are established, and at least two decimal digits for
energies of the other states are obtained. Results of PT series summation together with some results
of Ref. [21] are represented in Table 2. This table also illustrates convergence of Pad´e approximants
we used. The convergence is sharply increased with γ decreasing, and at γ < 0.3 the precision of
PS sum exceeds the precision of variational calculations [21].

This result was obtained by the method introduced by Bender and Wu [22]. First, the penetreability
of the barrier at imaginary magnetic ﬁeld value was computed in quasiclassical approximation, then
2 was applied. Stricktly speaking, according to the conditions of Ref.
the dispersion relation in
[5], expression (15) is not referred to the case of 3p-state. But it is reasonable to suppose that
formula (15) describes all six discussed here states with coeﬃcient D3p ﬁtted by comparing Ek and
˜Ek of suﬃciently high orders. The result is D3p = 213/33. The approach of exact coeﬃcients Ek to
asymptotic (15) is illustrated by Fig. 3.

In Refs. [4,5] the corrections to the asymptotic ˜Ek were obtained for some states, among which

2s-, 2p- and 3p-states were absent. Writing the corrections as

it is not diﬃcult, following the method of Ref. [22], to obtain ci coeﬃcients for all missing in [4,5]
states, see Table 3. As the number of ci coeﬃcients included in Eq. (16) is increased, the precision
of their determination increases as well.

For 3p-state this stability of the power correction coeﬃcients conﬁrms that the leading term ˜Ek
2 [5] coeﬃcients
of the asymptotic is determined correctly. Note, that due to dispersion relation in
ci are related with the corrections to quasiclassical approximation for the barrier penetreability at

orthogonality condition was preserved with a reasonable precision up to 18th PT order. Corrections
to the wave functions up to second order are given in Ref. [7]. By comparing this work and our one
the single point of deviation was observed. The sign at the r3γ2 term in Ref. [7] is erroneous and
as a result the ﬁrst order correction is not orthogonal to unperturbed wave function in work [7].

contributions to energy eigenvalues is indicated (the summation method is chosen correctly).

Our investigation demonstrates the high eﬃciency of the Ader moment method. Let us stress
once more the properties of the method which allowed to obtain the high PT orders for the Zeeman
eﬀect. These properties could be useful for solving some other problems of the perturbation theory.

equation. With their aid the corrections computation is reduced to purely algebraic procedure.

– The nodes of the wave function are not shown explicitly and do not complicate the computa-

tions. As a consequence the excited states can be considered.

– The level degeneracy, as was demonstrated above, does not restrict application of the mo-
ment method, but it leads to more complicated sequence of operations when solving the recurrence
relations.

– Besides, the set of moments used for hyper-susceptibilities determination contains information
about the wave function. Corrections to Coulomb wave function, just as corrections to energy
eigenvalues, follow from purely algebraic procedure.

As it was already mentioned, application of the moment method to the hydrogen atom is not
bijri−jzj leads to
restricted by the Zeeman eﬀect case. Any perturbation of the kind V (r) =
recurrence relation (4) with an obvious simple modiﬁcation of the right-hand side. For example,
this way it is possible to take into account the joint inﬂuence of external electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
homogeneous or consisting of ﬁnite number of multipoles.

(Dated: November 15, 2012)

In measurements of small signals using spin precession the precession angle usually grows linearly
in time. We show that non-linear interactions between particles can lead to an exponentially growing
spin precession angle, resulting in an ampliﬁcation of small signals and raising them above the noise
level of a detection system. We demonstrate ampliﬁcation by a factor of greater than 8 of a spin
precession signal due to a small magnetic ﬁeld gradient in a spherical cell ﬁlled with hyperpolarized
liquid 129Xe. This technique can improve the sensitivity in many measurements that are limited by
the noise of the detection system, rather then the fundamental spin-projection noise.

Observation of spin precession signals forms the basis
of such prevalent experimental techniques as NMR and
EPR. It is also used in searches for physics beyond the
Standard Model [1, 2, 3, 4], sensitive magnetometery [5],
and a wide range of other atomic physics and condensed
matter experiments. Hence, there is signiﬁcant interest
in the development of general techniques for increasing
the sensitivity of spin precession measurements. Several
methods for reducing spin-projection noise using quan-
tum non-demolition measurements have been explored
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and it has been shown that in some cases
they can lead to improvements in sensitivity [11, 12]. In
this Letter we demonstrate a diﬀerent technique that uses
spin interactions to amplify the spin precession signal
rather than to reduce the noise.

noise. However, the majority of experiments are not lim-
ited by quantum ﬂuctuations. For a small number of
spins the detection sensitivity is usually insuﬃcient to
measure the spin-projection noise of N 1/2 spins, while
for a large number of particles the dynamic range of the
measurement system is often insuﬃcient to measure a
signal with a fractional uncertainty of N −1/2. Ampli-
fying the spin-precession signal before detection reduces
the requirements for both the sensitivity and the dynamic
range of the measurement system. Optical methods al-
low eﬃcient detection of electron spins and some nuclear
spins [2] in atoms or molecules with convenient optical
transitions. However, for the majority of nuclei optical
detection methods are not practical and magnetic detec-
tion, using, for example, magnetic resonance force mi-
croscopy, has not yet reached the sensitivity where it is
limited by the spin projection noise [13, 14]. Therefore,
non-linear ampliﬁcation can lead to particularly large im-
provements in precision measurements relying on nuclear
spin precession.

In general any spin-spin interaction can lead to a non-
linear evolution of the system. Here we use long-range
magnetic dipolar interactions between nuclear spins that
cause a dynamic instability [15] and lead to an expo-
nential ampliﬁcation of spin precession due to a mag-
netic ﬁeld gradient. Other types of spin interactions,
such as spin-exchange collisions, also lead to dynamic
instabilities [16, 17] that can be used for non-linear sig-
nal ampliﬁcation. The eﬀects of magnetic dipolar ﬁelds
in spin polarized liquids have been extensively studied
[15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. It has also been shown that long-
range dipolar ﬁelds in conjunction with radiation damp-
ing due to coupling with an NMR coil lead to an increased
sensitivity to initial conditions and chaos [23]. To amplify
small spin precession above detector noise it is important
that the dynamic instability involves only spin interac-
tions, since instabilities caused by the feedback from the
detection system would couple the detector noise, such
as the Johnson noise of the NMR coil, back to the spins.
We measure spin precession using SQUID magnetome-
ters that do not have a signiﬁcant back-reaction on the
spins and show that under well controlled experimental
conditions the dynamic instability due to collective spin

Here β is proportional to the strength of the long-range
dipolar interactions. We measure m(1,0)
experimentally
by placing two SQUID detectors near the spherical cell
as illustrated in Fig. 1 and measuring the phase diﬀer-
ence ∆φ between the NMR signals induced in the two
SQUIDs. For small m(1,0)
, where ζ is a nu-
merical factor that depends on the geometry, for our di-
mensions ζ = 0.46
0.01. Thus, the phase diﬀerence ∆φ
is proportional to the applied magnetic ﬁeld gradient g
and grows exponentially in time, increasing the sensitiv-
ity to g by a factor G = sinh(βt)/βt. For M0 = 100 µG,
which is easy to realize experimentally with hyperpolar-
ized 129Xe, β = 1.75 sec−1, so that very large gains over
the non-interacting system can be achieved in a short
time, for example G = 360 after 5 seconds.

±

y

One of the main challenges to realizing such high gains
is to achieve suﬃcient control over the initial conditions
and non-linear evolution of the system, so that the dy-
namic instability gives rise to a phase diﬀerence ∆φ that
remains proportional to g even in the presence of vari-
ous experimental imperfections. We developed a set of
numerical and analytical methods for analyzing these ef-
fects [24]. Since our goal is to achieve very high sensi-
tivity to a small ﬁrst order longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
gradient g, we generally assume that it is smaller than
other gradients that are not measured directly. We ﬁnd
that the presence of transverse gradients and higher or-
der longitudinal gradients as well as initial magnetization
inhomogeneities cause an abrupt non-linear decay of the
overall magnetization. The time until the collapse tc of
the magnetization, which depends on the size of the inho-
mogeneities relative to M0, limits the achievable gain to
sinh(βtc)/βtc. Inhomogeneities of the applied ﬁeld sym-
metric with respect to the z direction, such as transverse
linear gradients or second order longitudinal gradients,
do not change the evolution of ∆φ, which remains pro-
portional to g until the collapse of the magnetization, as
shown in Fig. 2a). Higher order z-odd longitudinal gra-
dients do generate a phase diﬀerence (Fig. 2b). However,
the contributions of diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld gradients to
the phase diﬀerence add linearly as long as m(i,k)
1
and the eﬀects of higher order odd gradients can be sub-
tracted if they remain constant, as illustrated in Fig. 2b).
In addition, while higher order magnetization gradients
can grow with a time constant up to 2.5 times faster than
the ﬁrst order gradient, their contributions to the phase
diﬀerence between SQUIDs, approximately proportional
to the ﬁrst moment of the magnetization d =
zMydV ,
cancel to a high degree. For example, in Fig. 2b) the
overall signal decays at about 3 sec due to large ﬁrst and
third-order magnetization gradients but the phase diﬀer-
ence ∆φ remains much less than 1. One can show using a

signals in a predictable way.

Our measurements are performed in a spherical cell
containing hyperpolarized liquid 129Xe (Fig. 1). Liq-
uid 129Xe has a remarkably long spin relaxation time
[21] and the spin dynamics is dominated by the eﬀects
of long-range magnetic dipolar ﬁelds. Spherical geome-
try is particularly simple and analytic solutions can be
found using a perturbation expansion in a nearly uniform
magnetic ﬁeld H0 [21, 24]. We are primarily interested
in the ﬁrst order longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld gradient g,
H = (H0 + gz)ˆz, but will also consider other magnetic
ﬁeld gradients which inevitably arise due to experimen-
tal imperfections. The magnetization proﬁle can be ex-
panded in a Taylor series,

ent generates a background phase that can be subtracted to
determine a change in g between successive measurements.

Hence, the phase diﬀerence ∆φ can be used to measure
a very small linear gradient g in the presence of larger
inhomogeneities as long as all magnetic ﬁeld and magne-
tization inhomogeneities are much smaller than M0. The
ultimate sensitivity is limited by the ﬂuctuations of the
gradients between successive measurements. In addition
to the ﬂuctuations of g, which is the quantity being mea-
sured, the phase diﬀerence will be aﬀected by the ﬂuctu-
ations in the initial magnetization gradients m(1,0)
and
m(1,0)
and, to a smaller degree, higher order z-odd gra-

via a 0.2 mm glass wire to mix the sample, ensuring
uniformity of the polarization. In addition to mixing the
sample, the membrane inhibits convection across the cell
due to small temperature gradients which can wash out
the longitudinal gradient of the magnetization. A set of
coils inside the shields create a 10 mG magnetic ﬁeld and
allow application of RF pulses and control of linear and
quadratic magnetic ﬁeld gradients. The NMR signal is
detected using high-Tc SQUID detectors. The pick-up
coil of each SQUID detector is an 8

located approximately 1.6 cm from the center of the cell
and tilted by

45◦ relative to the magnetic ﬁeld.

In our experimental system, the time scale of the dipo-
lar interactions is much faster than the spin relaxation
time or the time needed to polarize a fresh sample of
129Xe. In order to make multiple measurements on a sin-
gle sample of polarized xenon, we ﬁrst apply a π/2 pulse
and monitor in real time the SQUID signals. When the
NMR signal drops to 90% of its initial value, a second π/2
pulse is applied, 180◦ out of phase with the ﬁrst, realign-
ing the magnetization with the holding ﬁeld. The silicon
membrane is then oscillated back and forth to mix the
magnetization, erasing the inhomogeneities developed in
the previous trial.

Fig. 3a) shows the oscillating transverse magnetiza-
tion and Fig. 3b) shows the phase diﬀerence between
the two SQUID signals. We determine the value of β
from the magnitude of the NMR signal and ﬁt the phase
diﬀerence to Eq. (5) with g as the only free parameter.
The dash-dot line shows the expected evolution of the
phase diﬀerence for the same gradient in the absence of
dipolar interactions, demonstrating that without ampli-
ﬁcation the phase diﬀerence would be barely above the

the two curves are due to noise in the magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient as well as possible imperfections in the erasing of
magnetization gradients between successive trials.

Fig. 4b) shows the gain parameter for the same data
set. We associate the rising gain at the beginning of
the data set with a decay of the magnetization inhomo-
geneities developed during collection of liquid 129Xe in
the cell. In the shaded region of the plot we did not mix
the magnetization with the membrane before the mea-
surement, resulting in a drop of the gain as well. Numer-
ical simulations indicate that the gain is likely limited by
higher order gradients, for example a second order mag-
netic ﬁeld gradient on the order of 1 µG/cm2, which can
not be excluded based on our mapping of ambient ﬁelds,
is suﬃcient to limit the gain to about 10.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that non-linear
dynamics arising from long range dipolar interactions can
be used to amplify small spin precession signals, improv-
ing the signal-to-noise ratio under conditions where limi-
tations of the spin detection system dominate the spin
projection noise. By amplifying the signal before de-
tection, this technique reduces the requirements on the
sensitivity of the spin detection technique as well as its
dynamic range. Such signal ampliﬁcation can be used in
a search for a permanent electric dipole moment in liq-
uid 129Xe [21]. It can also be potentially used to amplify
small spin precession signals in various NMR applica-
tions, allowing, for example, direct detection and imag-
ing of the magnetic ﬁelds generated by neurons with MRI
[26].
Initial inhomogeneities of the magnetization can
also be ampliﬁed, which can be used, for example, to de-
tect very slight diﬀerences in T1. We would also like to
thank DOE, NSF, the Packard Foundation and Princeton
University for support of this project.

ment the phase is ampliﬁed by a factor of 9.5 before the
magnetization drops to 90% of its initial value.

By applying a series of double pulses we can make re-
peated measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient. Fig.
4a) shows data where the applied longitudinal gradient is
oscillated with an amplitude of 1 µG/cm between trials.
The stars show the applied gradient, the squares show
the gradient measured by the non-linear spin evolution,
indicating that the ampliﬁed signal faithfully reproduces

Dynamics of neutral atoms in nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds, typical of quadrupole magnetic traps,
is considered by applying an accurate method for solving nonlinear systems of diﬀerential equations.
This method is more general than the adiabatic approximation and, thus, permits to check the
limits of the latter and also to analyze nonadiabatic regimes of motion. An unusual nonadiabatic
regime is found when atoms are conﬁned from one side of the z –axis but are not conﬁned from
another side. The lifetime of atoms in a trap in this semi–conﬁning regime can be suﬃciently long for
accomplishing experiments with a cloud of such atoms. At low temperature, the cloud is ellipsoidal
being stretched in the axial direction and moving along the z –axis. The possibility of employing
the semi–conﬁning regime for studying the relative motion of one component through another, in a
binary mixture of gases is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The motion of neutral atoms in nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds is important to study for several applications, in
particular, for better understanding the mechanics of conﬁnement in quadrupole magnetic traps, such as the Ioﬀe–
Pritchard traps with a static bottle ﬁeld [1-3] or dynamic traps with a rotating bias ﬁeld [4,5]. This has become
especially interesting after the experimental observation of Bose condensation in very cold gases of Rubidium [6,7],
Lithium [8], and Sodium [9-11]. There exists extensive literature considering statistical properties of conﬁned Bose
systems, using various approaches, e.g. the quasiclassical density–of–state approximation [12,13], the Gross–Pitaevskii
equation [14-16], the Monte Carlo density–matrix calculations [17], the Thomas–Fermi approximation [18,19], the
Bogolubov approximation [20], and the gas approximation in the frame of the Gibbs ensembles [21,22]. Statistical
properties of the weakly interacting Fermi gas conﬁned in a potential well have also been studied in the Thomas–Fermi
approximation [23,24].

The aim of this paper is to consider not statistics but dynamics of atoms in nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds. When one
is interested in the behaviour of conﬁned atoms, one deals with their stationary motion. Stationary regimes can be
described by the adiabatic approximation. When the conﬁning potential is harmonic, then the dynamics of atoms is
given by simple harmonic oscillations. In general, the conﬁning potential is not necessarily harmonic. For instance,
the ﬁrst demonstrated magnetic trap [25] used a quadrupole ﬁeld (with zero magnetic ﬁeld at the center) which gave
rise to a linear potential. In any case, atomic motion in a strictly conﬁning potential can be described by the adiabatic
approximation. Such adiabatic motion in various magnetic traps has been analysed in Refs. [26-29].

A more general consideration of atomic motion, without using the adiabatic approximation, is meaningful for several
reasons: First of all, a more general approach makes it possible to understand the limits of the adiabatic approximation.
Second, studying other, nonadiabatic, regimes of motion permits to explain more profoundly the physics of atoms
inside magnetic traps, as far as in these not all atoms are conﬁned. Knowing better diﬀerent, including nonadiabatic,
regimes of atomic motion may, possibly, give a hint on how to improve conﬁning characteristics of magnetic traps.

One more reason is related to the recently reported experiments on the simultaneous trapping of two diﬀerent atomic
species, two isotopes of rubidium [30] and sodium and potassium [31]. These experiments are a starting point for a
new series of studies of ultracold matter. The variety of eﬀects that can be observed in mixtures are incomparably
richer than in one–component gases. This concerns even equilibrium mixtures [32]. Much more interesting features
appear when one of the components can move through another. For instance, in a binary mixture with such a relative
motion the eﬀect of conical stratiﬁcation [33] can occur. This eﬀect happens when one of the components moves in one
direction through another component. Then the instability can develop inside a cone with the axis along the relative
velocity; as a result of this instability, the components stratify in space. Note that for this eﬀect the one–directional
relative motion is necessary, but not relative oscillations or collisions of sloshing clouds. In the presence of a relative

1

macroscopic motion some unusual manifestations of the Doppler eﬀect [34] may also arise. But can such a strange
regime exist when the atoms of one kind move in one direction being conﬁned from another? In addition, it is desirable
that this one–directional escape from a trap would not be too fast in order to be able to accomplish measurements.
These requirements look too severe to allow the existence of such a semi–conﬁning regime. However, in what follows it
will be shown that this semi–conﬁning regime does exist. Certainly, it is nonadiabatic and, even more, nonpotential,
thus cannot be described in the frame of the adiabatic approximation.

II. EVOLUTION EQUATIONS

Since the aim of this paper is to present an accurate solution of evolution equations for atoms in nonuniform
magnetic ﬁelds, it is reasonable, ﬁrst of all, to pay attention to the accurate formulation of the equations themselves.

which again assumes a slow variance of magnetic ﬁeld in space. When the magnetic ﬁeld is a linear function of real–

ﬁelds which in what follows we shall deal with. Hence, the sole approximation we need is the mean–ﬁeld one Eq.(6).

which will be the main object of our consideration.

The derivation of (10), though simple enough, contains an important point which is worth emphasizing. The basic
approximation (6) supposes that the system ﬁelds slowly vary in real space, so that the spin and real–space degrees of
freedom can be separated, which in the quantum–mechanical language means that the wave function can be factorized
into a product of spin and real–space wave functions [35]. This quantum–mechanical separation of variables, as will
be shown in what follows, is closely related to their dynamical separation.

The evolution equations (10) are to be supplemented by the initial conditions

In specifying the form of the magnetic ﬁeld, let us take it as in the experiments [5-7] with dynamical quadrupole

traps. Then the total magnetic ﬁeld

is the sum of the quadrupole ﬁeld

and the rotating bias ﬁeld

where

→
e α is a unit vector for α = x, y, z .

The characteristic length

of the quadrupole–ﬁeld nonuniformity corresponds to the radius of the ﬁeld zero in the radial direction. This length
deﬁnes approximately the upper limit for the radius of a trapped atomic cloud. Keeping this in mind, it is convenient

We are concerned about an accurate solution of the system (19) and (20) of nonlinear diﬀerential equations, without
using the adiabatic approximation. At this point, to distinguish what is what, it is useful to say several words about
the adiabatic approximation. Fortunately, this will not take too much space, since the latter approximation is rather
trivial. First, one assumes that the dynamical process is close to its stationary state, so that it is admissible to put

Assume that the ﬁeld rotates much faster than the mechanical oscillations of atoms, but not so fast as to induce
ω2 . Then the adiabatic force can be averaged
transitions in the Zeeman substructure. This means that ω1 ≪
over the period 2π/ω of the rotating bias ﬁeld. Averaging this force and using Eq.(16), one gets

This is a harmonic, although anisotropic, potential. The motion of atoms in such a potential is given by simple
harmonic oscillations, if S < 0 . When S = 0 , atoms ﬂy away ballistically and if S > 0 , they escape by the
exponential law. In both latter cases atoms escape from the trap in all directions. The ballistic ﬂying away is isotropic.
The exponential escape, because of the anisotropy of the adiabatic potential, is anisotropic: atoms escape faster along

III. SCALE SEPARATION

Return to the general equations (19) and (20). Written in the standard form, they compose a nonlinear dynamical
system of the ninth order, that is, a system of nine nonlinear diﬀerential equations. It seems that it is impossible to solve
this complicated system of equations without invoking a rough approximation like the adiabatic one. Nevertheless,
these equations can be solved using the method of scale separation [36,37]. The mathematical foundation of this
approach is based on the Krylov–Bogolubov averaging method [38] and the Poincar´e theory of generalized asymptotic
expansions [39]. The method of scale separation was successfully applied to several intricate problems, such as the
origin of self–organized spin superradiance in nuclear magnets [36], coherent radiation regimes of spin masers [40,41],
and fast polarization reversal in proton targets used for studying beam scattering [42]. The accuracy of this approach
has been conﬁrmed by good agreement of its solutions with experimental data [43,44] and with computer simulations
[45,46].

The ﬁrst step of the method of scale separation [36,37] is to classify the functional variables of the problem, separating
time scales. Fortunately, in the majority of interesting physical problems it is possible to separate relatively slow from
relatively fast variables.
In our case, such a separation is naturally related to the mean–ﬁeld condition (6) used
for deriving the evolution equations (19) and (20). As has been already discussed above, condition (6) assumes
that the real–space nonuniformity in the system is, in some sense, small. Now we ascribe an exact meaning to
this phrase concretizing in what sense the nonuniformity is small. The nonuniformity in the system is connected
with the quadrupole ﬁeld (13) and pair interactions in (9), while the rotating bias ﬁeld (14) is spatially uniform.
Therefore, what we need is to compare the characteristic parameters related to the corresponding ﬁelds. Among these
in Eq.(17), and γ in Eq.(18). The nonuniformity is weak if the
characteristic parameters we have ω1 and ω2
characteristic parameters corresponding to nonuniform ﬁelds are small as compared to that of a uniform ﬁeld. The
latter means nothing but the validity of the inequalities

ω1 ≪

ω2,

γ

≪

ω2.

(21)

The meaning of the ﬁrst inequality in (21) is quite evident, indicating that the frequency of mechanical oscillations
of atoms is much smaller than that of spin ﬂuctuations. The second inequality is also very natural, as far as the
collision rate is usually much smaller than ω2 . If γ would be comparable with ω2 this would imply atomic collision
are causing radio–frequency transitions between magnetic sublevels. With Eq.(21) in mind, looking at the evolution
→
r is to be treated as slow, compared to the fast variable
equations (19) and (20), we notice at once that the variable
→
S .

At this point, it is worth emphasizing how naturally the separation of functional variables into slow and fast,
with respect to time, is connected with the character of nonuniformity in real space. This is why spending some
time for remembering the derivation of Eqs.(10) was not in vain, but, on the contrary, is important for stressing the
self–consistency of the approximations used.

Following further the method of scale separation [36,37], we need to solve the equations for fast variables, with slow
variables being kept as quasi–integrals of motion. The evolution equation for fast variables is Eq.(20) for spin. This
equation for an arbitrary given antisymmetric matrix ˆA , with elements Aij =
Aji , can be solved exactly. This
→
means that we are able to present an exact solution for
S for any given external ﬁelds. Because of the signiﬁcance
of such s solution, we write it down explicitly.

At the next step of the method of scale separation [36,37] the solution for fast variables is to be substituted into the
equations for slow variables with time averaging the right–hand side of the latter equations. As follows from Eqs.(27)
and (29), the fast spin ﬂuctuations are described by the eﬀective time–dependent frequencies ϕi(t)/t . Hence, the
solution (26) does not have a deﬁnite period. Consequently, the time averaging is given by the rule

This force essentially depends on the initial polarization of spins, as it should be in the general case and in contrast
to the adiabatic force mentioned at the end of Sec.II. Only for one type of initial polarization, when Sx

The solution of the Weierstrass equation (50) is the Weierstrass function

The behaviour of x1(t) and z1(t) shows that the atoms with an initial polarization S > 0 are conﬁned from the
side z > 0 but are not conﬁned from the side z < 0 . Vice versa, the atoms with an initial polarization S < 0
are conﬁned from the side z < 0 but are not conﬁned from that z > 0 . Thus, as ensemble of atoms, with a given
polarization, loaded into a trap would move predominantly in one direction either to z < 0 or to z > 0 depending
on whether the initial polarization is S > 0 or S < 0 , respectively. Such a regime is exactly that semi–conﬁning
regime we have been looking for.

However, we need yet to ﬁnd the solutions of nonhomogeneous equations in (44). To this end, we have to concretize
the variable ξ originating from the averaged pair interactions. For a rareﬁed system these interactions can be treated
as random pair collisions. The system is said to be rareﬁed if the average atomic density ρ and the scattering length
a satisfy the inequality ρa3
1 . This is just the case of experiments [5-11] with alkali atoms. Therefore, we can
consider ξ as a random variable. More accurately, ξ(t) can be modelled by a stochastic ﬁeld. The latter may be
speciﬁed as white Gaussian noise [50] with the stochastic averages

where D is a diﬀusion rate. Then the nonhomogeneous equations in (44) become stochastic diﬀerential equations.
An explicit way of treating the random variable ξ is presented in Appendix.

When solving the nonhomogeneous equations, it is useful to invoke again the idea of scale separation. The time
variation of solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations reﬂects the properties of the given stochastic ﬁelds. Since in
our case, the stochastic ﬁeld ξ(t) is modelled by white noise, which is characterized by sharp time jumps [50], then
the related functional variables x2 and z2 can be treated as fast compared to x1 and z1 satisfying the equations
not containing such random ﬁelds. Hence, for the stochastic diﬀerential equations in (44), the slow variables x1 and
z1 can be kept as quasi–integrals of motion [36,37]. Then using the method of Laplace transforms, we obtain

Remember that the general solutions to the equations (39) and (40) have the form of the sums in (41) containing
both the regular terms x1 and z1 and the random terms x2 and z2 . The relative contribution of these terms is
regulated by the relation between the parameters γ, D , and ω1 . If γ2D
1 , then the inﬂuence of the random
terms x2 and z2 is negligibly small, and the atomic motion is characterized by the regular terms x1 and z1 . In
this case we have the semi–conﬁning regime. An ensemble of atoms would form an ellipsoidal cloud moving in one of
the directions along the z –axis. If γ2D
1 , then the motion of atoms is governed by the random terms x2 and
z2 . In such a case, an ensemble of atoms would form an almost isotropic exponentially expanding cloud.

Assuming, as usual, that the diﬀusion rate D is proportional to temperature T , we come to the conclusion that
the realization of either the regime of the fast exponential expansion or the regime of the slow semi–conﬁned motion
depends on temperature. At high temperatures the former regime will be realized while at low temperatures, the
latter. A crossover temperature Tc related to the equality γ2D = ω3
1 would correspond to the eﬀective boundary
between these two regimes.

VI. NUMERICAL ESTIMATES

In order to impart to the whole consideration a completely realistic ﬂavour and to show the reasonability of all
inequalities assumed for employing the method of scale separation, let us adduce numerical estimates basing on the
characteristic quantities typical of the experiments [5-7] with 87Rb in dynamical quadrupole traps.

Hence, the classiﬁcation of atomic variables as slow and of spin variables as fast, based on the inequalities in (21), is
correct.

this over time between t = 0 and some t , we have

In the interval of temperatures between 1 nK and 1 mK , it changes from 10−6 to 1 . The quantity z0, according
to Eq.(43), is the initial coordinate z1(0). It is clear that a cloud of trapped atoms should have a distribution of z0
which depends on the temperature and shape of the conﬁning potential. The average value of z0 can be interpreted
as the initial location of the center of an atomic cloud. This value can be diﬀerent for diﬀerent experiments. Keeping
this in mind, we consider below several values of z0. The integral (69) was calculated numerically for diﬀerent initial

the help of hydrodynamic equations. If the local equilibrium is absent, one has to use kinetic equations.

VII. CONCLUSION

The method of scale separation is applied to the dynamics of neutral atoms in nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds typical of
quadrupole magnetic traps. We concentrate our attention on the case of a dynamic quadrupole trap with a rotating
bias ﬁeld, as in experiments [5-7]. For the initial spin polarization Sx
0 < 0 , the motion of atoms is conﬁned and well
described by the adiabatic approximation.

For the atoms whose spins are initially polarized along the z –axis a novel unusual regime appears where the
motion is conﬁned in a half–space: when Sz
0 < 0 ,
it is conﬁned from the side z < 0 . This semi–conﬁned motion is nonadiabatic and nonpotential. An ensemble of
atoms in a semi–conﬁning regime forms an ellipsoidal cloud stretched in the axial direction and slowly moving along
the z -axis to the nonconﬁning side.

0 > 0 , the motion is conﬁned from the side z > 0 , and if Sz

The semi–conﬁning regime can be used for studying mixtures with a relative motion of components. For example,
one component can have initial spin polarization Sx
0 < 0 , thus, being conﬁned, while another component, with initial
spin polarization along the z –axis, can be semi–conﬁned, moving through the ﬁrst. Or one can load into a trap
two components both being polarized along the z –axis, but one with Sz
0 < 0 . Then
both such species will be in the semi–conﬁning regime but moving in opposite directions, one to the negative z – and
another to positive z –direction. The variant with three components, one of which is conﬁned with the two others
semi–conﬁned moving in opposite directions, could also be realized. Mixtures with the relative motion of components
can display a number of interesting features, e.g., the eﬀect of conical stratiﬁcation [33].

0 > 0 while another with Sz

The semi–conﬁning regime can also be employed for separating the species with diﬀerent initial polarizations. For
instance, if one loads into a trap a mixture of two components, one having the spin polarization up and another down,
then the trap will act as a separator moving the ﬁrst component down and the second one up, thus separating them.
One more application of the semi–conﬁning regime could be for realizing atom lasers, for which a directed motion

of atoms is necessary.

Appendix. Random Variables

The variable ξ(t) describing random pair collisions of atoms has been treated as a stochastic variable. Consequently,
Eqs.(44) are stochastic diﬀerential equations. To ﬁnd their solution, it was necessary to deﬁne the stochastic averages
(59). The explicit deﬁnition of the random variable ξ(t) and of the corresponding stochastic averages can be done in
the following way.

Assume that there is a set

of functions ϕn(t) ennumerated by a multi–index n. Let this set be complete

Each coeﬃcient ξn is considered as a random variable with a probability distribution p(ξn). For concreteness, we may
think of pn(ξn) as a Gaussian distribution.

The stochastic averaging for a function F (ξ(t)) of the stochastic variable ξ(t) is deﬁned as the functional integral

ξ(t) =

If the random coeﬃcient ξn is complex, then dξn ≡

We have measured the 6s − 7p1/2,3/2 transition probabilities in atomic cesium using a direct
absorption technique. We use our result plus other previously measured transition rates to derive
an accurate value of the vector transition polarizability β and, consequently, re-evaluate the weak
charge QW . Our derived value QW = −72.65(49) agrees with the prediction of the standard model
to within one standard deviation.

Bennett and Wieman’s measurement [1] in 1999 of the
ratio of the oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne amplitude Mhf to the
vector polarizability β for the 6s − 7s transition in ce-
sium enabled them to evaluate the weak charge QW of
the electroweak interaction. In this evaluation they used
a theoretical value for Mhf which has been veriﬁed in
subsequent calculations [2, 3]. Their QW value diﬀers
from the prediction of the standard model by almost
2.5 standard deviations and has stimulated several re-
cent theoretical papers [4, 5, 6, 7] which calculate the
parity-nonconserving transition amplitude EPNC of the
cesium 6s − 7s transition.

This recent interest suggested a careful study of all
the measured parameters which go into such a test. The
scalar and vector polarizabilities α and β can be calcu-
lated as sums involving the reduced matrix elements of
the electric-dipole transition rates from the 6s and 7s
states (Refs. [8, 9, 10]):

In Eqs. (1,2), dominant contributions come from the
n = 6, 7 terms. Therefore, the most important contribu-
tions come from the 6s − 6p, 7s − 6p, 6s − 7p, and 7p − 7s
matrix elements. The dominant contribution to the un-
certainties of α and β calculated using this direct sum-
mation method comes from the uncertainty of 6s − 7p3/2
matrix element [10].

In this paper, we present new measurements of 6s − 7p
transition rates. The sum needed for the vector polariz-
ability has some severe cancellations; hence, we use the
experimentally well-determined α/β ratio [11] and our
new measurement to determine β, and, consequently, re-
evaluate the weak charge QW .

The best previous measurement of the 6s − 7p tran-
sition rates was a photographic optical absorption mea-
surement utilizing the hook method [12]. The relative
measurement relied on the known values for the 6s−6p3/2
transition. In order to measure the transition probability
directly, we have made an absolute absorption measure-
ment of laser light passing through a known number of
cesium atoms for each transition.

An electrically heated and insulated cesium cell, at
temperatures between room temperature and 90 ◦C pro-
vided a 5 cm long target for laser light close to the reso-
nant wavelengths of 455 nm (7p3/2) and 459 nm (7p1/2).
The cell temperature was measured with a multiprobe
NIST calibrated K-type thermocouple thermometer with
an accuracy of 0.1 ◦C degree. The needed blue light is
produced by direct second harmonic generation (SHG)
from a potassium niobate (KNbO3) 5 × 5 × 5 mm crys-
tal pumped with a Coherent Model MBR-110 Tita-
nium:Sapphire (Ti:Sapphire) ring laser.

To acquire each single absorption spectrum we scan
the Ti:Sapphire laser over a frequency range of 15 GHz
during a 50 seconds time interval. We observe two well-
resolved absorption peaks during each scan, since the
separation between the hyperﬁne states of the 6s ground
state equals 9.19 GHz. The hyperﬁne structure of the
7p level is not resolved due to the much larger Doppler
broadening of approximately 750 MHz at 65 ◦C. Further
experimental details will be published later [13].

Comparison of absorption rates for several laser
intensities for the 6s − 7p transitions at a ﬁxed cesium cell
temperature.

Since saturation might signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ab-
sorption measurements, we have measured the absorp-
tion for several diﬀerent laser intensities, as shown in
Figure 1. Similar results are also obtained for several
diﬀerent cell temperatures. We have made an average of
seventy sets of data to obtain the transition probabili-
ties for the 6s − 7p3/2 transition of 1.836(18) × 106 s−1
and for the 6s − 7p1/2 transition of 7.934(80) × 105 s−1.
Adding other uncertainties (due to temperature measure-
ments and Cs vapor pressure) to these values yields re-
sults accurate to 1.6%. The corresponding reduced ma-
trix elements are compared with theory [10, 14, 15] and
experiment [12] in Table I.

First, we calculate the value of α using the formula
In Table II, we list the values of electric-
of Eq. (1).
dipole matrix elements used in this calculation (present,
Refs. [10, 16, 17]) together with the uncertainty of each
matrix element and its contribution to the uncertainty
in the value of α. We also list the contributions to the
value of α from the terms with n > 7 and from the term
αvc which compensates for the excitations from the core
to the valence shell violating Pauli principle; these very
small contributions are taken from Ref. [10]. As we see
from Table II, the uncertainty in α is dominated by the
uncertainty in the value of the 7p3/2 − 6s matrix element.
Therefore, our more accurate measurement of the 7p3/2 −
6s matrix element allows a signiﬁcant decrease of the
uncertainty in the value of α (and correspondingly β)
obtained by this method.

In more detail, dominant contributions to the scalar
and vector polarizabilities α and β come from matrix el-
ements of terms with n = 6 and n = 7, while n = 8
and n = 9 contributions are relatively small but signiﬁ-
cant. The contributions from the terms with n > 9 are
very small (less than 0.4% according to [10]). Therefore,

the values of only eight matrix elements are needed to
be known to high accuracy to produce accurate values of
α and β: 6p1/2 − 6s, 6p3/2 − 6s, 7p1/2 − 6s, 7p3/2 − 6s,
6p1/2 − 7s, 6p3/2 − 7s, 7p1/2 − 7s, and 7p3/2 − 7s. The
values of the 6p − 6s matrix elements were measured to
better than 0.15% precision in [16]. The values of the
7p−7s matrix elements were derived in Ref. [10] from the
experimental value of the Stark shift from Ref. [18] with
0.15% precision. These experimental values are in excel-
lent agreement with all high-precision theoretical calcu-
lations [10, 14, 15]. The electric-dipole matrix elements
for 7p1/2 − 6s and 7p3/2 − 6s transitions are measured
in this work with 0.8% accuracy. The previous measure-
ment of the 7p3/2 − 6s matrix element from [12] has 1.7%
uncertainty which gave the dominant contribution to the
uncertainties of the recommended values of α and β in
Ref. [10]. The 7p1/2 − 6s and 7p3/2 − 6s matrix elements
are also diﬃcult to calculate accurately (see, for exam-
ple, Ref. [10] for discussion). The matrix elements for the
7s − 6p transitions are derived from the measurement of
the 7s lifetime conducted in Ref. [17]. The ratio of the
reduced matrix elements for 7s − 6p3/2 and 7s − 6p1/2
transitions is taken to be R = 1.528 ± 0.004 based on
theoretical calculations [10, 14, 15]. The uncertainty of
the ratio does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the uncertainties of
the reduced matrix elements. We used the theoretical
values for matrix elements with n = 8, 9 (the values of
6s − 8p matrix elements are taken from Ref. [10]) and
the experimental values of energies from [19] in evalu-
ating formula of Eq. (1). We obtain the ﬁnal value for
the scalar transition polarizability α = 269.7(1.1) a.u..
Table II shows that 98.5% of this value comes from the
experimentally derived contributions (n = 6, 7).

EPNC = 0.9065(36) × 10−11iea0QW /N, where N is the
number of neutrons and a0 is the Bohr radius, to give
the value of the weak charge QW . We note that the ac-
curacy of the theoretical calculation of EPNC was taken
in Ref. [1] to be 0.4% based on the comparison of the
theoretical calculations of various atomic properties con-
[8, 21] with experi-
ducted by the authors of Refs.
ment. The resulting value of the weak charge QW =
−72.06(28)expt(34)theor [1] was found to diﬀer from the
value predicted by the standard model QSM
W = −73.09(3)
from [22] by 2.3σ. Using our experimental result and
the analysis given above to determine α, plus the mea-
surement by Cho et al [11] of the α/β ratio, we de-
rive the almost completely experimentally determined
value β = 27.22(11) a3
0. We use this result to deter-
mine the value of weak charge QW = −72.58(49), which
diﬀers by only 1.1σ from the one predicted by the stan-
dard model [22]. However, the theoretical calculations of
EPNC have been improved recently to include Breit and
vacuum-polarization corrections to the PNC amplitude
[4, 5, 6, 7]. The revised value of the PNC amplitude,
given in Ref. [6], which is the average of three most ac-
curate calculations [5, 8, 21] and includes contributions
from Breit and vacuum-polarization corrections [4, 6] is
EPNC = 0.9057(37) × 10−11iea0 QW /N. Combining this
value with experiment [20] and our result for β we obtain
our ﬁnal value for the weak charge

QW = −72.65(49),

which is in agreement with the value predicted by the

these results with recent calculations for the weak charge
QW .

In conclusion, we have measured the probabilities of
the 6s − 7p1/2,3/2 transitions in atomic cesium using a di-
rect absorption technique. We then indicate a straight-
forward method to determine the scalar transition po-
larizability α based almost completely on experimentally
determined atomic parameters. Including a previous ac-
curate experimental determination of the α/β ratio yields
a value for the vector polarizability β and for the weak
charge QW .

Our derived value for QW agrees with the value pre-
dicted by the standard model to within one standard
deviation. We compared the result with that of Ben-
nett and Wieman [1] and also with recent atomic cal-
culations [4, 5, 6, 7] in Figure 2. Future improvements
in this method of estimating QW can come from bet-
ter calculations (or experimental measurements) of the
7s − 6p transition rates and also from Tanner’s measure-
ment in progress (private communication) of the ratio of
the 6s − 7p transition rates.

Helium Atoms

We perform fully quantum mechanical calculations in the binary approximation of the emission
and absorption proﬁles of the sodium 3s-3p and potassium 4s-4p resonance lines under the inﬂuence
of a helium perturbing gas. We use carefully constructed potential energy surfaces and transition
dipole moments to compute the emission and absorption coeﬃcients at temperatures from 158 to
3000 K. Contributions from quasi-bound states are included. The resulting red and blue wing
proﬁles agree well with previous theoretical calculations and with experimental measurements.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Pressure broadened line proﬁles of alkali-metal atoms are prominent in the spectra of brown dwarfs and may be
a source of opacity in extrasolar giant planet atmospheres [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Accurate calculations of these proﬁles
are important in developing eﬀective diagnostics of the temperatures, densities, albedos and composition of the
atmospheres of these objects [7, 8].

In a recent paper[9], we studied the pressure broadening of the lithium 2s-2p resonance line. Here we consider the
broadening of the 3s-3p line of sodium and the 4s-4p line of potassium arising from collisions with helium atoms. We
carry out full quantitative quantum-mechanical calculations of the emission and absorption coeﬃcients in the red and
blue wings, based on calculated potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moments. We include contributions
from quasi-bound states and we allow for the variation of the transition dipole moment with internuclear distance.
We compare our results with previous theoretical calculations and experimental measurements.

II. QUANTUM MECHANICAL CALCULATION

The system we consider here consists of a mixture of alkali-metal atoms in a bath of helium atoms. If the gas
densities are low enough that only binary collisions occur, the problem can be reduced to the radiation of temporarily
formed AHe (A=Na, K) molecules. The broadened ns-np atomic line corresponds to transitions between the excited
A2Π and B2Σ electronic states of the AHe molecule and the ground X2Σ state. The X2Σ and B2Σ states have no
bound states and the A2Π state has a shallow well which supports a number of bound ro-vibrational levels. Thus
we consider both bound-free and free-free transitions. The details of the quantum mechanical calculation of pressure
broadening are given in our previous paper [9].

III. POTENTIALS AND DIPOLE MOMENTS

We adopt potential energy surfaces computed by Theodorakopoulos and Petsalakis [10] for sodium and by Santra
and Kirby [11] for potassium for short and intermediate internuclear distances. The C6 coeﬃcients for long range
interactions are taken from the latest theoretical calculations of Zhu et al. [12]. The potential energy curves of the
X 2Σ, A2Π and B2Σ states are shown in Fig. 1 for NaHe and Fig. 2 for KHe. The wavelengths λ(R) corresponding
to the energy diﬀerences VA2Π(R) − VX 2Σ(R) and VB2Σ(R) − VX 2Σ(R) are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 for NaHe and
KHe respectively. Extremes in the energy diﬀerences as a function of R lead to the presence of satellite features in
the emission and absorption spectra. The well-depth of the A2Π state of NaHe is about three times larger than that
of KHe, but both NaHe and KHe have six bound vibrational levels for zero angular momentum J = 0. Table I is a
listing of the binding energies of the vibrational levels of the two molecules.

The adopted X 2Σ − B2Σ and X 2Σ − A2Π transition moments [11, 13] are shown in Fig. 5 for NaHe and Fig. 6 for

KHe.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

2

The bound-free emission coeﬃcient is a weighted sum of the emission rates Wν of the individual ro-vibrational
levels of the A2Π state [9]. In Figs. 7 and 8, we plot Wν as a function of wavelength for a number of ro-vibrational
levels for sodium and potassium, respectively. The corresponding radiative lifetimes are listed in Tables II and III.
They do not diﬀer much from the lifetimes of the excited atoms, 16.3 ns for Na [14, 15] and 26.5 ns for K [16], into
which the A2Π states of the molecules separate with the exception of the v = 4 level of KHe. For the v = 4 level of
KHe there occurs what appears to be a chance cancellation in the integration of the dipole matrix element.

In Figs. 9 and 10, we present the bound-free contributions to the total emission coeﬃcients in units of cm−3s−1Hz−1
for sodium and potassium, respectively. The spectra for NaHe and KHe are similar in shape to each other and to
LiHe [9] but shifted in wavelength. At low temperatures there occur broad maxima in the emission coeﬃcients at
around 670 nm for NaHe and 830 nm for KHe, compared to 870 nm for LiHe. The emissions are superpositions of
the individual ro-vibrational contributions of Figs. 7 and 8, arising from the A2Π states. For the same temperature,
the intensity of the red satellite is lower for potassium than for sodium. The emissions decrease rapidly at long
wavelengths, because there are no corresponding values of the internuclear distances, as shown by Fig. 3 for sodium
and Fig. 4 for potassium.

In the high pressure limit the bound and continuum states are thermally populated and the emission coeﬃcient is
the sum of the bound-free and free-free coeﬃcients. In Figs. 11 and 12, we plot our calculated emission coeﬃcients in
the high pressure limit for temperatures between 158 and 3000 K for sodium and potassium, respectively. For sodium,
the general shape in the red wing is in agreement with the experimental measurements of York et al. [17] and Havey
et al. [18] and the theoretical calculations of Pontius and Sando [19] and Theodorakopoulos and Petsalakis [10]. There
is no previous calculation or measurement for potassium. The blue wings are attributed to the B2Σ-X2Σ transitions,
where only free-free transitions occur and the resulting proﬁles decrease rapidly with decreasing wavelength. A weak
satellite appears near 532 nm at T = 3000 K for sodium and near 708 nm at T ≈ 2000–3000 K for potassium, as
expected from a consideration of the λ–R relations in Figs. 3 and 4. The satellites are shown on a linear scale in
Figs. 13 and 14.

In Figs. 15 and 16, we plot our calculated absorption coeﬃcients for sodium and potassium, respectively. These
proﬁles decrease steadily with separation from the position of the resonance line except for a blue satellite near 532 nm
at T ≈ 2000–3000 K for sodium and near 708 nm at T ≈ 1000–3000 K for potassium. The general shape in the red
and blue wings is in agreement with the theoretical predictions of Allard et al. [7] and Burrows and Volobuyev [8].
Using these calculated absorption proﬁles, we can infer from the Reid et al. (2000) spectrum [20] of the L5 dwarf,
2MASSW J1507, that the temperature of this dwarf is around 1000 K.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out quantum mechanical calculations for the emission and absorption spectra at wavelengths
between 500 and 760 nm for sodium and between 670 and 930 nm for potassium at temperatures from 158 to 3000 K.
For sodium we ﬁnd a blue satellite near 532 nm for T = 3000 K and a red satellite near 670 nm for T ≈ 158–240 K in
the emission spectra, and a blue satellite near 532 nm for T ≈ 2000–3000 K in the absorption spectra. For potassium
we ﬁnd a blue satellite near 708 nm for T ≈ 2000–3000 K and a red satellite near 830 nm for T = 158 K in the
emission spectra, and a blue satellite near 708 nm for T ≈ 1000–3000 K in the absorption spectra. Our results are
in good agreement with previous calculations and experiment. We infer that the temperature of the brown dwarf,
2MASSW J1507, is around 1000 K.

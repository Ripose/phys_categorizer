A low-light-power theory of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation of frequency-modulated light res-
onant with a J = 1 → J ′ = 0 transition is presented. The theory is developed for a Doppler-free
transition, and then modiﬁed to account for Doppler broadening and velocity mixing due to colli-
sions. The results of the theory are shown to be in qualitative agreement with experimental data
obtained for the rubidium D1 line.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR), or light-
power-dependent rotation of optical polarization due to
resonant interaction with an atomic medium in the pres-
ence of a magnetic ﬁeld B, has applications ranging from
fundamental symmetry tests to magnetometry [1]. With

the high-frequency side of the D2 F = 3 → F ′ transition, at
which maximum rotation occurs. The light intensity is ∼50
µW cm−2, and the beam diameter is ∼2 mm. The tempera-
ture of the cell is ∼19◦C corresponding to a vapor density of

NMOR due to the evolution of ground-state atomic po-
larization [2], optical rotation is proportional to the mag-
netic ﬁeld for small ﬁelds, but falls oﬀ when the Larmor
frequency ΩL = gµ0B (g is the gyromagnetic ratio, µ0
is the Bohr magneton, and we set ¯h = 1 throughout)
becomes larger than half of the atomic polarization re-
laxation rate γ (Fig. 1). Atomic polarization relaxation
1 Hz can be achieved for alkali
rates as low as γ
atoms contained in paraﬃn-coated vapor cells [4], corre-
sponding to magnetic ﬁeld widths of approximately 1 µG
3 pG Hz−1/2
[5] and high magnetometric sensitivity (
[3]) to small ﬁelds.

With a traditional NMOR magnetometer, the high
small-ﬁeld sensitivity comes at the expense of a limited
dynamic range. Since many applications (such as mea-
surement of geomagnetic ﬁelds or magnetic ﬁelds in space
[6]) require high sensitivity at magnetic ﬁelds on the or-
der of a Gauss, a method to extend the magnetometer’s
dynamic range is needed. It was recently demonstrated
[7, 8] that when frequency-modulated light is used to in-
duce and detect nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (FM
NMOR), the narrow features in the magnetic-ﬁeld de-
pendence of optical rotation normally centered at B = 0
can be translated to much larger magnetic ﬁelds. In this
setup (Fig. 2), the light frequency is modulated at fre-
quency Ωm, and the time-dependent optical rotation is
measured at a harmonic of this frequency. Narrow fea-
tures appear, centered at Larmor frequencies that are
integer multiples of Ωm, allowing the dynamic range of
the magnetometer to extend well beyond the Earth ﬁeld.
Light-frequency modulation has been previously ap-
plied to measurements of linear magneto-optical rotation
and parity-violating optical rotation [9, 10] in order to
produce a time-dependent optical rotation signal without
introducing additional optical elements (such as a Fara-
day modulator) between the polarizer and analyzer. Op-
tical pumping with frequency-modulated light has been
applied to magnetometry with 4He [11, 12, 13] and Cs
[14]; in these experiments transmission, rather than opti-
cal rotation, was monitored. In the latter work with Cs,
the modulation index (the ratio of modulation depth to
modulation frequency) is on the order of unity, in con-

allowing interpretation of the process in terms of the Λ-
or coherent-population-trapping resonances. A similar
method is the so-called quantum beat resonance tech-
nique [15] used, for example, for measuring the Land´e
factors of molecular ground states (see Ref. [16] and refer-
ences therein). In addition, the closely related method of
modulation of light intensity (synchronous optical pump-
ing) predates the frequency-modulation technique [17].
Intensity modulation was recently used in experiments
that put an upper limit on the (parity- and time-reversal-
violating) electric dipole moment of 199Hg (Refs. [18, 19]
and references therein).

harmonic amplitudes of FM NMOR. The experimental sig-
nals, plotted as a function of magnetic ﬁeld B applied along
the light propagation direction, are obtained with light tuned
to the wing of the F = 2 → F ′ = 1 absorption line of the
87Rb D1 spectrum. The laser power is 15 µW, beam diame-
ter is ∼2 mm, Ωm = 2π × 1 kHz, and modulation amplitude
is 2π × 220 MHz. All resonances have widths (∼1 µG) corre-
sponding to the rate of atomic polarization relaxation in the
paraﬃn-coated cell. The normalized calculated signals [Eq.
58], for a J = 1 → J ′ = 0 transition, are plotted as a func-
tion of normalized Larmor frequency ΩL/Ωm. For these plots,
the parameters ∆0/ΓD = 0.7, Ωm/γ = 500, and ∆l/∆0 = 1
(described in Sec. III) are chosen to match the experimental
parameters given above.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND
COMPARISON WITH THEORY

→

A quantitative theory of FM NMOR would be of use
in the study and application of the technique. As a ﬁrst
step towards a complete theory, we present here a per-
J ′ = 0 atomic tran-
turbative calculation for a J = 1
sition that takes into account Doppler broadening and
averaging due to velocity-changing collisions. We begin
the discussion in Sec. II by comparing experimental FM
NMOR magnetic-ﬁeld-dependence data obtained with a
paraﬃn-coated 87Rb-vapor cell to the predictions of the
calculation (described in Sec. III). We ﬁnd that the sim-
pliﬁed model still reproduces the salient features of the
observed signals, indicating that the magnetic-ﬁeld de-
pendence of FM NMOR at low light power is not strongly
dependent on power or angular momentum. As discussed
in Sec. IV, the description of the saturation behavior and
spectrum of FM NMOR in a system like Rb, on the other
hand, will require a more complete theory.

→

Figures 3 and 4 show ﬁrst- and second-harmonic data,
respectively, obtained from an FM NMOR magnetome-
ter with light tuned near the D1 line of rubidium in the
manner described in Ref. [7, 8], along with the predicted
J ′ = 0 transition obtained from
signals for a J = 1
the theory described in Sec. III with parameters match-
ing those of the experimental data. The calculation for
the simpler system reproduces many of the qualitative
aspects of the experimental data for Rb. The features at
the center of the in-phase plots of Figs. 3 and 4 are the
zero-ﬁeld resonances, analogous to the one shown in Fig.
1.
(The background linear slope seen in the in-phase
signals is also a zero-ﬁeld resonance, due to the “tran-
sit eﬀect” [1]. It is modelled in the theory by an extra
term analogous to the others with the isotropic relax-
ation rate γ equal to the transit rate of atoms through the
laser beam.) In addition to these features, there appear

new features centered at magnetic ﬁeld values at which
= 1/2 and 1. For the ﬁrst-harmonic signal, the
ΩL/Ωm|
|
former are larger, whereas for the second-harmonic, the
latter are; this is primarily a result of the diﬀerent light
detunings used in the two measurements. For these new
resonances, there are both dispersively shaped in-phase
signals and π/2 out of phase (quadrature) components
peaked at the centers of these resonances. The resonances
occur when the optical pumping rate, which is periodic
with frequency Ωm due to the laser frequency modula-
tion, is synchronized with Larmor precession, which for
an aligned state has periodicity at frequency 2ΩL as a
result of the state’s rotational symmetry. This results
in the atomic medium being optically pumped into an
aligned rotating state, modulating the optical properties
of the medium at 2ΩL. The aligned atoms produce max-
imum optical rotation when the alignment axis is at π/4
to the direction of the light polarization and no rota-
tion when the axis is along the light polarization. Thus,
on resonance, there is no in-phase signal and maximum
quadrature signal. The relative sizes and signs of the
features in the magnetic-ﬁeld dependence, largely deter-
mined by the ratio of the modulation width ∆0 to the
Doppler width ΓD (Sec. III), are well reproduced by the
theory. The theory also exhibits the expected linear light-
power dependence of the optical rotation amplitude as
observed in experiments at low power [7, 8].

III. THEORY

A.

Introduction

The goals for a complete theory of FM NMOR are
outlined in Sec. IV. As a ﬁrst step towards such a theory,
we calculate here the optical rotation due to interaction
of frequency-modulated light with a Jg = 1
Je = 0
atomic transition (Fig. 5), where the subscripts g and e
indicate the ground and excited states, respectively. We
will assume that the light power is low enough that no
optical pumping saturation occurs.

→

We begin by calculating the time-dependent atomic
ground-state coherence of a Doppler-free system. Us-
ing the magnetic-ﬁeld–atom and light–atom interaction
Hamiltonians (under the rotating wave approximation)
we write the density-matrix evolution equations. Under
the low-light-power approximation, an expression for the
ground-state atomic coherence can be written as a time
integral. We convert the integral to a sum over harmonics
of the modulation frequency by expanding the integrand
as a series. This form is convenient for this calculation
because the optical rotation signal is measured by lock-
in detection. The expression for the Doppler-free case
is then modiﬁed to take into account Doppler broaden-
ing and velocity averaging due to collisions. Atoms in
an antirelaxation-coated vapor cell collide with the cell
walls in between interactions with the light beam, pre-
serving their polarization but randomizing their veloci-
ties. In the low-light-power case, we can account for this
by ﬁrst calculating the eﬀect of optical pumping assum-
ing no collisions, and then averaging the density matrix
over atomic velocity. Note that in this case we assume
that optical pumping is unsaturated not only for the res-
onant velocity group, but also when atomic polarization
is averaged over the velocity distribution and cell volume.
Using the wave equation, we ﬁnd an expression for the
time-dependent optical rotation in terms of the atomic
ground-state coherence of a given atomic velocity group.
This rotation is then integrated over time and atomic
velocity to obtain an expression for the signal at a given

harmonic measured by the lock-in detector.

Thus the matrix elements of d+1 and d−1 for this transi-
tion can be written

We assume that the upper state spontaneously decays

processes can be neglected in comparison with the spon-

matrix Γ, given by

In order to conserve the number of atoms, the ground
state must be replenished at the same rate at which it
relaxes. This is described by the repopulation matrix Λ:

These equations can be used to solve for the optical and
ground-state coherences.

F. Calculation of the optical and ground-state
coherences

The expression for optical rotation (Sec. III H) is writ-
ten in terms of the optical coherences ρ31,23. We will now
relate the optical coherences to the ground-state coher-
ence ρ21 and ﬁnd an expression for ρ21 as a sum over har-
monics of the light detuning modulation frequency Ωm.
This form is convenient because the signal is measured
at harmonics of this frequency.

Solving Eqs. (19a) and (19b) for ρ31 and ρ23 in terms

of ρ21, we obtain

ρ31 ≃

Ω (N/3

ΩL −
Ω (N/3

In order to solve for ρ21, we make the substitution ρ21 →

The expressions for the optical coherences [Eqs. (20)] are
then substituted into the expression for the ground-state
coherence [Eq. (23)]. Assuming that the light power is
low (Ω
γ0) allows us to neglect second-order terms.
We also assume that the level shift induced by the mag-
netic ﬁeld is smaller than the natural line width,
i.e.
γ0. (For the D-lines of rubidium used in the ex-
ΩL ≪

to the earth-ﬁeld range.) The ground-state coherence is

now modify this result to describe an atomic ensem-
ble with a Maxwellian velocity distribution leading to
a Doppler width ΓD of the transition. For an atomic

light propagation direction, the light frequency is shifted
according to ω(v) = ω (1

In a situation in which atomic collisions are important,
such as in a vapor cell with a buﬀer gas or an antire-
laxation coating, this result must be further modiﬁed to
take into account collisionally induced velocity mixing.
For atoms contained in an antirelaxation-coated vapor
cell, we assume that each velocity group interacts sep-
arately with the excitation light, but after pumping all
groups are completely mixed. This model applies when
light power is low enough so that optical pumping av-
eraged over the atomic velocity distribution and the cell
volume is unsaturated. The ground-state coherence of
each velocity group becomes the velocity-averaged quan-
tity ¯ρ21(v), given by the normalized velocity average of

We now derive the formula for the optical rotation in
terms of the polarization of the medium P = Tr ρd. The

can be described by [21]

IV. CONCLUSION

9

−

Each term of the sums corresponds to a resonance at
ΩL/Ωm =
n/2 (Figs. 3,4). Near each resonance the in-
phase signal is dispersive in shape, whereas the quadra-
ture signal is a Lorentzian. When plotted as a function
of the Larmor frequency normalized to the modulation
frequency, ΩL/Ωm, the widths of the resonances are de-
termined by the normalized ground-state relaxation rate
γ/Ωm. The relative amplitudes of the resonances are de-
termined by the ratio of the modulation depth to the
Doppler width, ∆0/ΓD, and the normalized average de-
tuning ∆l/∆0.

We have presented a theory of nonlinear magneto-
optical rotation with low-power frequency-modulated
light
The
for a low-angular-momentum system.
magnetic-ﬁeld dependence predicted by this theory is
in qualitative agreement with experimental data taken
on the Rb D1 line. Directions for future work in-
clude a more complete theory describing higher-angular-
momentum systems,
including systems with hyperﬁne
structure, and higher light powers. A possible compli-
cation to the FM NMOR technique in systems with hy-
perﬁne structure is the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect present
at higher magnetic ﬁelds, so a theoretical description of
this eﬀect would also be helpful. FM NMOR has been
shown to be a useful technique for the selective study
of higher-order polarization moments [8] (see also Ref.
[22]). Higher-order moments are of interest in part be-
cause signals due to the highest-order moments possible
in a given system would be free of the complications due
to the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect. To describe these mo-
ments, a calculation along the same lines as the one pre-
sented here but carried out to higher order and involving
more atomic sublevels would be necessary.

If T is many modulation periods, the above integrals can
be approximated by averages over one period. Thus, we
can change the limits of the integrals to (
π, π), and set
the normalizing factor (ΩmT )−1 to (2π)−1. Using the
trigonometric substitutions

As in the evaluation of Eq. (24), use of the approximate
an/2 [Eq. (35)] results in the cancella-
expression bn ≃
tion of some terms proportional to ΩL, producing the
relatively simple form of Eq. (55).

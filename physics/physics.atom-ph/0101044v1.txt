Abstract

We have performed ab initio mixed-states and sum-over-states calculations
of parity nonconserving (PNC) electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes be-
tween s-d electron states of Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+. For the lower states of
these atoms we have also calculated energies, E1 transition amplitudes, and
lifetimes. We have shown that PNC E1 transition amplitudes between s-d
states can be calculated to high accuracy. Contrary to the Cs 6s-7s transi-
tion, in these transitions there are no strong cancelations between diﬀerent
terms in the sum-over-states approach. In fact, there is one dominating term
which deviates from the sum by less than 20%. This term corresponds to an
s-p1/2 weak matrix element, which can be calculated to better than 1%, and
a p1/2-d3/2 E1 transition amplitude, which can be measured. Also, the s-d
amplitudes are about four times larger than the corresponding s-s transitions.
We have shown that by using a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach
the accuracy of the calculations of PNC s-d amplitudes could compete with
that of Cs 6s-7s if p1/2-d3/2 E1 amplitudes are measured to high accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

Precise low-energy experiments on parity nonconservation (PNC) in atoms provide a test
of the standard model of elementary particle interactions. By measuring PNC electric dipole
(E1) transition amplitudes, the value of the nuclear weak charge can be extracted by compar-
ison with calculations. In a recent PNC experiment with cesium [1] the PNC E1 transition
amplitude between the 6s and 7s states has been determined with an unprecedented accu-
racy of 0.35%. However, interpretation of the experiment is limited by the accuracy of the
atomic calculations. Since 1989, calculations of the 6s-7s transition in Cs have been at the
1% level [2,3]. At this level of accuracy the value of the nuclear weak charge is consistent with
that predicted by the Standard Model. Recent measurements of values relevant to the PNC
E1 amplitude (E1 transition amplitudes, hyperﬁne structure constants) are in much better
agreement with the calculated values than they were ten years ago. From this it has been
claimed that the accuracy of the calculated PNC E1 amplitude is 0.4% [4]. Re-interpreting
the Cs measurement with the higher accuracy, while using the calculations [2,3], the value
of the nuclear weak charge gives a 2.5 σ deviation from the Standard Model prediction [4].
However, inclusion of the Breit interaction into the calculations reduces the deviation by
about 1 σ [5,6]. Note that these measurements give the best limits on new physics beyond
the Standard Model, such as extra Z bosons, leptoquarks, composite fermions [7–9].

One obviously needs an independent conﬁrmation of the Cs result. In this paper we show
that the accuracy of calculations of PNC E1 transitions between s-d states of Cs, Fr, Ba+,
and Ra+ could compete with that of the Cs 6s-7s transition. The experiment for the 6s-5d
transition in Ba+ is already in progress [10].

II. MANY-BODY CALCULATIONS

We perform calculations for N-electron atoms with one external electron above closed
shells. The calculations start from the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) method in the ˆV N −1
approximation. The single-electron RHF Hamiltonian is

ˆH0 = cα

ˆp + (β

Z/r + ˆV N −1,

α and β are Dirac matrices and ˆp is the electron momentum. The accuracy of RHF energies
is of the order of 10% for heavy atoms like Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+.

In order to obtain more realistic wavefunctions, electron-electron correlations must be
taken into account. Correlation corrections to the electron orbitals are calculated using
the “correlation potential” method [11]. This method corresponds to adding a non-local
correlation potential ˆΣ to the potential ˆV N −1 in the RHF equation (1) and then solving for
the states of the external electron. The correlation potential is deﬁned such that its average
value coincides with the correlation correction to energy, δEi =
. The correlation
potential is calculated by means of many-body perturbation theory in the residual Coulomb
interaction

where ˆH is the exact Hamiltonian of an atom. The lowest-order correlation diagrams
(second-order in U) are presented in Fig. 1. At this level of calculation the accuracy for
energy levels is about 1%.

Using the correlation potential method and the Feynman diagram technique we include
three series of higher order diagrams which are calculated in all orders of perturbation
theory [2,12,13]. These are screening of the electron-electron interaction, the hole-particle
interaction, and chaining of the self-energy operator ˆΣ. The electron-electron screening
(see Fig. 2) and the hole-particle interaction (Fig. 3) are incorporated into the self-energy
operator ˆΣ (Fig. 4). Chaining of the self-energy operator to all orders (Fig. 5) is then
calculated by adding ˆΣ to the Hartree-Fock potential ˆV N −1 and solving the equation

( ˆH0 + ˆΣ

iteratively for the states of the external electron.
In this way “Brueckner” energies and
orbitals are obtained. These energies have an accuracy of the order of 0.1%. The wavefunc-
tions can be further modiﬁed by placing a coeﬃcient before ˆΣ such that the corresponding
energy coincides with the experimental value. This ﬁtting of the Brueckner orbitals can be
considered as a way of including higher-order diagrams into the calculations.

We use the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method (which is equivalent to the random-
phase approximation with exchange) to calculate the interaction of external ﬁelds with
atomic electrons.
In this paper we deal with two external ﬁelds: the electric ﬁeld of the
photon (E1 transition amplitudes) and the weak ﬁeld of the nucleus. In the RHF approxima-
tion the interaction between an external ﬁeld ˆHext and atomic electrons is

where ψHF
Inclusion of the polarization of the atomic core
by an external ﬁeld is reduced to the addition of a correction δ ˆV (which is the correction
to the Hartree-Fock potential due to the interaction between the core and the external
ﬁeld) to the operator which describes the interaction,
. To include
“Brueckner-type” correlation corrections the RHF orbitals are simply replaced by Brueckner
. The Brueckner-type correlations give the dominant corrections
ones,
to the RHF approximation. They correspond to diagrams in which the interactions occur
in the external lines of the self-energy operator (see, e.g., Fig. 6). Those diagrams in which
the E1 interaction occurs in the internal lines are known as “structural radiation”, while
those in which the weak interaction occurs in the internal lines are known as the “weak
correlation potential” (see, e.g., Fig. 7). There is also a correction to the amplitudes arising
from the normalization of states [11]. The structural radiation, weak correlation potential,
1/10,
and normalization contributions are suppressed by the small parameter Eext/Ecore ∼
where Eext and Eint are excitation energies of the external and core electrons, respectively.

where GF is the Fermi constant, QW is the weak charge of the nucleus, γ5 is a Dirac matrix,
and ρ(r) is the density of the nucleus. Parity nonconserving E1 transition amplitudes, arising
due to the simultaneous interaction of atomic electrons with the nuclear weak charge and
the photon ﬁeld, can be calculated using two methods: from a mixed-states approach; or
from a sum-over-states approach, in which experimental values (energies and E1 transition

presented diagrammatically in Figs. 6, 7.

Note that the sum-over-states approach should also include the states with double-

excitations like, for example in Cs,
. In the mixed-states approach these
states are included, for example, in the last term of Eq. 5 (see also diagram (c) of Fig. 8).
These exotic states contribute due to their mixing with the single-excited electron states.
This means that the mixed-states calculation (5) is more complete than the sum-over-states
(6) unless the high-energy states with two or more excited electrons are included into the
sum.

However, the accuracy of pure ab initio calculations for s-d transitions is not very good
because of the huge correlations for d-states. On the other hand, we will see in the next
section that this problem can be avoided in the sum-over-states approach by using exper-
imental values for the p-d E1 transition amplitudes. Therefore, the best accuracy can be
achieved when both methods are combined. Substitution of experimental values into the
sum-over-states approach leads to a correction to the PNC amplitude which can be added
to the mixed-states result. Following this procedure, it is possible to determine the PNC s-d
amplitudes with an accuracy of about 1% (see discussion in the end of the next section).

Hartree-Fock energies for Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+ are presented in Table I. These have an
accuracy of the order of 10%. The Brueckner energies, including the three series of higher
order diagrams, are also presented in Table I. These energies have an accuracy of the order
of 0.1%.

Electric dipole transition amplitudes between the states m and m′ are calculated in length

the radial integral. In Table II we present radial integrals relevant to the sum-over-states
calculation for Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+. In this table we present the values obtained in the
RHF approximation and show the contribution of core polarization to the RHF integrals; we
also present the (unﬁtted) Brueckner results and the contributions arising from structural
radiation and normalization of states.
In Table III we present radial integrals between
the lower states of the four atoms which are calculated with ﬁtted Brueckner orbitals and
with structural radiation and normalization contributions included. Experimental values
for Cs and Fr are presented in Table IV. The Cs transitions 5d3/2-6p3/2 and 5d3/2-6p1/2
were extracted from the measurement [26] of the 5d3/2 lifetime, τ = 909(15) ns by assuming
that the ratio of the calculated radial integrals corresponds to the ratio of the experimental
values. This assumption was also used to obtain the Fr 7d3/2-7p3/2 and 7d3/2-7p1/2 radial
integrals from the measured lifetime τ = 73.6(3) ns [28]. With the exception of the Cs 6s-
7p1/2 transition, the calculations of s-p1/2 radial integrals agree with experiment at the level
of 0.1%. The poor accuracy of the 6s-7p1/2 radial integral is due to the fact that the main
RHF contribution is very small and the relative contribution of all corrections is large. The
5d-6p radial integrals for Cs have poor accuracy, deviating from experiment by about 4%.
This is indicative of the poor calculation of d-states due to very large correlation corrections.
The accuracy for the Fr 7d-7p radial integrals is about 1%. The reason that this accuracy is
better than that for Cs 5d-6p is because the accuracy of the higher d-levels (here 7d rather
than 6d) is better due to smaller correlation corrections.

We have calculated the lifetimes of the low-lying states of Ba+ and Ra+. The nd3/2 states
of Ba+ (n = 6) and Ra+ (n = 7) decay directly to the ground state via the E2 transition; the
nd5/2 states decay via both the E2 and M1 transitions. Lifetimes of the Ba+ 5d states are
presented in Table V. The calculations were performed with ﬁtted Brueckner orbitals; core
polarization, structural radiation, and normalization contributions were included into the E2
transition amplitudes. The calculations are in good agreement with experiment. We have
also presented the calculations performed by Guet and Johnson [29]. It appears that for the
state 5d5/2 they have not taken into account the M1 transition. This seems to be the reason
for the discrepancy between the lifetime calculations for this state. From our calculations
it is seen that inclusion of the M1 transition eﬀectively decreases the lifetime of the 5d5/2
state from 36.3 s to 30.3 s. For Ra+ we obtained the lifetimes τ = 0.641 s and τ = 0.302 s
for the states 6d3/2 and 6d5/2, respectively; these were calculated in the same way as for the
Ba+ 5d states. The lifetimes for states of Ra+ have not been measured. Lifetimes of all
other states are strongly dominated by E1 transitions and so can be calculated using the
radial integrals presented in Table III. The calculated lifetimes of the 6p states of Ba+ are in
excellent agreement with experiment and calculations by Guet and Johnson (see Table V).
The mixed-states results for the E1 PNC transition amplitudes are listed in Table VI.

The results of the sum-over-states calculation, and the contributions of the six terms corre-
sponding to the summation of the n-(n + 2) p states, are presented in Table VII. In both
calculations the contributions of structural radiation, weak correlation potential, and nor-
malization of states are not included. The s-d PNC amplitudes are up to about four times
as large as their corresponding s-s amplitudes. Furthermore, unlike the contributions to the
sum-over-states calculation in Cs 6s-7s, in which the dominant contribution is about twice
as large as the ﬁnal result due to strong cancelations between three major terms in the sum,
the PNC s-d transitions in Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+ are strongly dominated by a single term.

In each case this term corresponds to
this term is diﬀerent from the sum by less than 20%.
Because the Cs 6p1/2-5d3/2 E1 transition and energies are known we can correct the
mixed-states PNC result. Replacing the calculated values by these experimental values in
the dominating term of the sum (6) for Cs increases this term (and the total sum) by about
4%. This correction is mostly due to the diﬀerence between the calculated and experimental
E1 amplitude (see Table IV). From the 1% accuracy of calculations of hyperﬁne structure
constants for s and p1/2 states [13] we can expect that the accuracy of the s-p1/2 weak matrix
elements in this calculation is also about 1%. Therefore, we can say that the uncertainty in
the calculated ab initio s-d E1P N C amplitudes is dominated by the uncertainty of the p-d
E1 matrix elements and constitutes about 4% for Cs and about the same value, or a little
more, for other atoms.

is 0.126 ieaB(
E1P N C(6s
QW /N). Since using the experimental 6p-5d E1 amplitude
removes the main source of uncertainty, the accuracy of the modiﬁed result must be con-
siderably better than 4%. Assuming high accuracy of p-d transition amplitudes, one can
say that the uncertainty is now dominated by the uncertainty of calculated s-p weak matrix
elements which is about 1% (however, we believe that this accuracy can be improved beyond
1% with the inclusion of weak correlation potential and normalization contributions). More
rigorous calculations and a more detailed analysis of the accuracy will be carried out when
the need arises from the progress in experiments. We expect that calculations of E1P N C
amplitudes for Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+, with empirical corrections, can reach an accuracy of
about 1%.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have calculated the PNC E1 transition amplitudes between s-d states of Cs, Fr, Ba+,
and Ra+. Generally, high accuracy cannot be reached in purely ab initio calculations of these
transitions due to the poor accuracy of d-states. However, we have shown from a sum-over-
states calculation that, unlike the Cs 6s-7s transition, the s-d transitions we have mentioned
are strongly dominated by a single term in the sum. Moreover, this term corresponds to an
s-p1/2 weak matrix element, which can be calculated with an accuracy of better than 1%, and
a p1/2-d3/2 E1 transition amplitude, which can be taken from experiment. The need to reach
high accuracy for d states is therefore avoided. In addition to this, PNC s-d transitions are
larger than the corresponding s-s transitions. The mixed-states calculation can be modiﬁed
by correcting the terms in the sum-over-states by inserting experimental E1 transitions and

6

energies. If p1/2-d3/2 E1 transition amplitudes are measured to high accuracy, we believe
that the accuracy of the calculations of s-d PNC transitions for Cs, Fr, Ba+, and Ra+ can
reach 1%.

FIG. 7. Small corrections to the PNC E1 transition amplitude: external ﬁeld inside the correla-

the change in Σ due to the weak interaction); this is known as the weak correlation potential.
Diagrams (b,c) represent structural radiation (photon ﬁeld inside the correlation potential).
In

electromagnetic interactions occur in the internal lines.

and the cross denotes the weak interaction). Diagram (c) corresponds to the polarization of the

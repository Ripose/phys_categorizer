Abstract

A ﬁrst detailed study of the ground state of the H +

3 molecular ion in linear conﬁguration,

parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld direction, and its low-lying Σ, Π, ∆ states is carried out for magnetic

ﬁelds B = 0 − 4.414 × 1013 G in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The variational method

is employed with a single trial function which includes interelectron correlation term explicitly

in the form exp (γr12), where γ is a parameter.

It is shown that the quantum numbers of the

state of the lowest total energy (ground state) depend on the magnetic ﬁeld strength. Ground

state evolves from spin-singlet 1Σg state for weak magnetic ﬁelds B . 5 × 108 G to the weakly-

bound spin-triplet 3Σu state for intermediate ﬁelds and, eventually, to the spin-triplet 3Πu state

for 5 × 1010 G. B . 4.414 × 1013 G.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The behavior of atoms, molecules and ions placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld has attracted

a signiﬁcant attention during the last two decades (see, in particular, review papers [1–3]).

It is motivated by both pure theoretical interest and by possible practical applications in

astrophysics and solid state physics.

In particular, a knowledge of energy levels can be

useful for interpretation of the spectra of white dwarfs where a surface magnetic ﬁeld B ≈

106 −109 G and neutron stars where it varies from B ≈ 1012 −1013 G up to B ≈ 1014 −1016 G

for magnetars.

Recently, it was announced that in a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld B & 1011 G the

exotic molecular ion H 2+

3

can exist in linear conﬁguration with protons situated along the

magnetic line [4] (for discussion see a review [3]). In general, it is metastable long-living
system which decays to H +
system does not exist without or for weak magnetic ﬁelds. The ion H 2+

2 + p, however, at B & 1013 G the ion H 2+

3 becomes stable. This

constitutes the

3

simplest one-electron polyatomic molecular ion in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Recently, H 2+

3

has been used as a possible chemical compound of main abundance of the atmosphere of

the isolated neutron star 1E1207.4-5209 [5]. A detailed review of a current status of one-

electron molecular systems, both traditional and exotic those might exist in a magnetic ﬁeld

B ≥ 109 G is given in [3].

The molecular ion H +

3 is the simplest stable two-electron polyatomic molecular ion. It

has a long history since its discovery by J.J. Thomson [6]. Its exceptional importance in

astrophysics related to interstellar media explains a great interest to this ion from astronomy,

astrophysics and chemistry communities (for detailed review see [7]). It has been used as a

benchmark for theoretical calculation of polyatomic molecules. For all these reasons, there

have been extensive theoretical and experimental works on this molecular ion since the

pioneer (semi-quantitative) work by Coulson [8].

The ﬁrst variational calculations [9] of the total energy of the molecular ion H +

3 showed

that the equilibrium conﬁguration might be either linear or equilateral triangular conﬁg-

uration. However, it was not well-established until 1964 [10] when it is shown that the

equilibrium conﬁguration for the state of the lowest total energy is an equilateral triangular

conﬁguration, while in the linear conﬁguration the H +
3

ion may occur in excited state(s).

Since that time a large number of excited states was studied [11] (for a general review, see

2

[7]). In particular, it is found there exists a single spin-triplet state, 3Σu which appears in a
linear conﬁguration. This is also the unique known state of H +

3 in the linear conﬁguration.

None spin-triplet states are found for a triangular (spacial) conﬁgurations so far.

Although the molecular ion H +

3 is characterized by the equilateral triangular conﬁguration

as the optimal in ﬁeld-free case it is expected that in a magnetic ﬁeld B ≈ 0.2 a.u. (see below)

a linear, parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld direction conﬁguration gets the lowest total energy and

becomes the optimal conﬁguration. Somehow, a similar phenomenon already happened for

the one-electron exotic molecular ion H 2+

3

[12] when optimal triangular conﬁguration at

108 G . B . 1011 G becomes the linear parallel one at ≈ 1011 G. It is worth noting that

for H +

3 in ﬁeld-free case the diﬀerence in the total energy of the ground state (triangular
conﬁguration) and of the lowest linear conﬁguration is very small, ≈ 0.13 Ry, in comparison

to characteristic energies in a magnetic ﬁeld.

To the best of our knowledge there exists a single attempt to explore the molecular ion

H +
3

in a magnetic ﬁeld [13]. However, this work is clearly out of conﬁdence, it contains

many actual errors. It forced us to repeat all numerical calculations of this work following

its guidelines (see Tables I-VIII below). In [13] it was mentioned that with a magnetic ﬁeld

increase the transition from equilateral stable equilibrium conﬁguration to linear equilibrium

conﬁguration may occur. This is a correct statement. We predict that this transition takes

place at a magnetic ﬁeld ≈ 0.2 a.u. A detailed study of a triangular conﬁguration and this

transition will be published elsewhere [14].

Atomic units are used throughout (~=me=e=1), although energies are expressed in Ryd-
bergs (Ry). The magnetic ﬁeld B is given in a.u. with a conversion factor B0 = 2.35×109 G.

II. GENERALITIES

Let us consider a system of three protons and two electrons (pppee) placed in a uniform

constant magnetic ﬁeld.

If for such a system a bound state is developed it corresponds

to the molecular ion H +

3 . We assume that the protons are inﬁnitely massive (the Born-

Oppenheimer approximation of zero order). They are situated along the magnetic ﬁeld

direction forming a linear chain (we call it “the parallel conﬁguration”). The Hamiltonian

which describes this system when the magnetic ﬁeld is oriented along the z direction, B =

The problem under a study is characterized by three conserved quantities: (i) the operator

and total spin, respectively, and ρℓ =

p

of the z-component of the total angular momentum (projection of the angular momentum on

the magnetic ﬁeld direction) giving rise to the magnetic quantum number m, (ii) the spatial

parity operator P (~r1 → −~r1, ~r2 → −~r2) which has eigenvalues p = ±1(gerade/ungerade)

(iii) the operator of the z-component of the total spin (projection of the total spin on the

magnetic ﬁeld direction) giving rise to the total spin projection ms. Hence, any eigenstate

has three explicit quantum numbers assigned: the magnetic quantum number m, the total

spin projection ms and the parity p. For the case of two electrons the total spin projection

ms takes values 0, ±1.

As a magnetic ﬁeld increases a contribution from the Zeeman term (interaction of spin

with magnetic ﬁeld, B · S) becomes more and more important. It seems natural to assume

that if for small magnetic ﬁelds a spin-singlet state is a state of a lowest total energy, while

for large magnetic ﬁelds it is a spin-triplet state with ms = −1, the electron spins are

antiparallel to the magnetic ﬁeld direction B. The total space of eigenstates is split into

subspaces (sectors), each of them is characterized by deﬁnite values of m, p and ms. It is

worth noting that the Hamiltonian H is invariant with respect to reﬂections z1 → −z1 and

z2 → −z2 (z-parity operator Pz). Hence, any eigenstate is characterized by the quantum

numbers σN = ±1 for positive/negative z-parity (this symmetry accounts for the interchange

of the nuclei A and C if they are situated symmetrically with respect to B).

In order to classify eigenstates we follow the convention widely accepted in molecular

physics using the quantum numbers m, p and the total spin S without indication to the

value of ms. Eventually, the notation is 2S+1Mp, where 2S + 1 is the spin multiplicity which

is equal to 1 for spin-singlet state (S = 0) and 3 for spin-triplet (S = 1), as for the label

M we use Greek letters Σ, Π, ∆ that mark the states with |m| = 0, 1, 2, ..., respectively,

and the subscript p (the spatial parity quantum number) takes gerade/ungerade(g/u) labels

describing positive p = +1 and negative p = −1 parity, respectively. There exists a relation

between the quantum numbers corresponding to the z-parity (interchange of nuclei A and

C) and the spatial parity:

p = (−1)|m| σN .

Present consideration is limited to the states with magnetic quantum numbers m = 0, −1, −2

because the total energy of the lowest energy state (ground state) for any sector with m > 0

is always larger than anyone with m ≤ 0.

As a method to explore the problem we use the variational procedure. The recipe of

choice of trial functions is based on physical arguments [15]. As a result the trial function

5

for a lowest energy state with magnetic quantum number m is chosen in the form

ψ(trial) = (1 + σeP12)(1 + σNPAC)(1 + σNaPAB + σNaPBC) ×

where σe = ±1 stands for spin singlet (+) and triplet states (−), while σN = 1, −1 stands for

nuclear gerade and ungerade states, respectively. The P12 is the permutation operator for

electrons (1 ↔ 2) and Pij, i, j = A, B, C is the operator which interchanges the two protons

i and j. For S3-permutationally symmetric case (all protons are identical) σN = σNa = ±1.

α1−6, β1−2 and γ as well as R+, R− are variational parameters. Their total number is eleven.

It is worth emphasizing that in the trial function (4) the interelectron interaction is included

explicitly in the exponential form eγr12.

Calculations were performed using the minimization package MINUIT from CERN-LIB.

Multidimensional integration was carried out using a dynamical partitioning procedure: a

domain of integration was divided into subdomains following an integrand proﬁle and then

each subdomain was integrated separately (for details see e.g.

[3]). Numerical integration

was done with a relative accuracy of ∼ 10−6 − 10−7 by use of the adaptive D01FCF routine

from NAG-LIB. Computations were performed on a dual DELL PC with two Xeon processors

of 2.8 GHz each (ICN), 54-node FENOMEC and 32-node TOCHTLI clusters (UNAM) and

DUKE dual DELL PC with two Xeon processors of 3.06 GHz each (CINVESTAV). A process

of minimization for each given magnetic ﬁeld and for any particular state took from 100 to

1000 hours of CPU time due to a complicated proﬁle in a parameter space of the total energy

surface but when a minimum is found it takes several minutes to compute a variational

energy.

6

We carry out a detailed study of Σ, Π, ∆ low-lying states with a particular emphasis of

the state which has the lowest total energy for a given magnetic ﬁeld - the ground state.

For the case m = 0 we consider four subspaces in the Hilbert space, S = 0 (ms = 0) (spin

singlet states), S = 1 (spin triplet states) at ms = −1, σN = 1 (gerade states) and σN = −1

1Σg state (S = 0, σN = 1)

For ﬁeld-free case the system (pppee) in linear conﬁguration (all protons are situated on

a line, see Fig.1) the state 1Σg is the lowest total energy state which is characterized by a

shallow minimum (see e.g. [7]). However, in spite of developing a minimum for a linear chain

the system is unstable towards any deviation from linearity. Hence, this state is globally

unstable. It is worth noting that the true bound state does exist and it corresponds to the

equilateral triangular conﬁguration (the protons form equilateral triangle) with the total

energy ET = −2.6877 Ry (see e.g.

[16])). A situation is not so diﬀerent when a not that

strong magnetic ﬁeld is imposed B . 0.2 a.u.: linear parallel conﬁguration with the protons

situated along a magnetic line is characterized by well-pronounced minimum but a stability

towards a deviation from linearity does not occur and a global bound state 1Σg does not

exist. However, with a magnetic ﬁeld growth, at B ≥ 0.2 a.u. the system (pppee) becomes

stable towards small deviations from parallel conﬁguration and the 1Σg state exists (but as

an excited state, see below).

We made a detailed study of the state 1Σg of the H +

3 ion in the linear parallel conﬁguration

(all protons are situated on a magnetic line) with a particular emphasis of the symmetric

case R+ = R− ≡ R as well as small deviations from this conﬁguration in a wide domain of

magnetic ﬁelds 0 ≤ B ≤ 10000 a.u. (see Table I). Finally, for the linear parallel conﬁguration

the variational trial function ψtrial (4) with σe = 1, σN = 1 and m = 0 was used. It depends

on eleven variational parameters. A simple, obvious generalization of (4) is used to study

slightly deviated conﬁgurations when stability of the linear system was checked.

The variational calculations demonstrate in very clear way the existence of a minimum in

the total energy surface ET (R+, R−) for the (pppee) system for all magnetic ﬁelds ranging

B = 0 − 10000 a.u. Minimum always corresponds to the symmetric case R+

eq = R−

eq = Req of

the linear parallel conﬁguration. For B < 0.2 a.u. stability is lost with respect to deviations

from linearity. This indicates to a ”limited” existence of the molecular ion H +

3 in the state
1Σg for these magnetic ﬁelds. It exists if in some way a linear conﬁguration is supported

externally.

Table I displays the results for the total ET and the double ionization, EI = 2B −

8

ET , energies, as well as for the internuclear equilibrium distance Req for the state 1Σg.

We ﬁnd that with an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the total energy grows more

or less linearly with a magnetic ﬁeld, the system becomes more and more bound (both

double ionization and dissociation energies increase) and more compact (the internuclear

equilibrium distances R±

eq and a size of the system Leq = R+

eq + R−

eq decrease).

An important characterization of the system is given by a description of possible dissoci-

ation and ionization channels together with their behavior as a function of a magnetic ﬁeld.

There are three dominant dissociation channels: (i) H +

3 → H2 + p, (ii) H +

3 → H +

2 + H and

(iii) H +

3 → H − + p + p (see Table I) as well as two sub-dominant channels H +

3 → H +

2 + p + e

(ionization) and H +

higher ionization-dissociation energies than the channel H +

3 → H + H + p (dissociation). Last two channels are characterized by
2 + H and they are not

3 → H +

considered. There are two single-ionization processes H +

3 → H +

2 + p + e and H +

(see Table I). The second one occurs only at B > 10 a.u. where the H 2+
becomes a dominant single-ionization process at B > 10000 a.u. where ET (H 2+

3

3 + e

3 → H 2+
ion can exist, it
3 ) < ET (H +

2 ).

The total energy of the ﬁnal state compounds after dissociation for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds

is shown in Table I. It is interesting to mention that at B > 100 a.u. the dissociation
H +

3 → H − + p + p

3 → H 2+
3 + e dominates over H +
A comparison of the total energy of H +

3 for each studied magnetic ﬁeld with the total

energy of the products of dissociation or ionization leads to a main conclusion: the total
energy of the H +

3 ion is always the smallest. Thus, the H +
3

ion in the state 1Σg is stable

for all magnetic ﬁelds towards all possible dissociation or ionization channels. A smallest

dissociation energy corresponds to the channel H +
H +

3 →
3 → H − +p+p.
In general, the dissociation energy (the diﬀerence between the energies of the ﬁnal and initial

2 +H. While the largest dissociation energy corresponds to the channel H +

3 → H2+p, which then is followed by H +

states) increases monotonously with a magnetic ﬁeld growth. It is quite interesting that the

diﬀerence in total energies of the ﬁnal compounds of two major dissociation channels (i) and

(ii) grows extremely slow with the magnetic ﬁeld increase reaching 1.1 Ry at B = 100 a.u.
3 molecular ion in the state 1Σg exists for
if a linear parallel conﬁguration of protons is somehow supported externally.

A general conclusion can be drawn that the H +

B . 0.2 a.u.

However, for larger magnetic ﬁelds it exists as an excited state which is stable towards small

deviations from linearity. It is worth noting that for the magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.2 a.u. the

total energy well contains at least one longitudinal vibrational state. The vibrational energy

9

is calculated following the same procedure which is used for H 2+

ion [19] and it is equal to

3

0.035 Ry.

2.

3Σu state (S = 1, σN = −1)

In ﬁeld-free case the state 3Σu of the system (pppee) is the only state of the H +

3 in linear

conﬁguration which is known so far (i) and also it is the only known spin-triplet state of

H +

3 (ii) (for a review of this state see [23] and references therein). For this state several
vibrational states exist. The linear symmetric conﬁguration R+ = R− is stable towards any

small deviations, in particular, from linearity. The state 3Σu is stable with respect to the
decay H +
3 (3Σu) → H2(1Σg) + p.

2 + H (see [24]). Also there is no decay channel H +

3 → H +

A detailed variational study of the 3Σu state of the H +

3 molecular ion is done for

0 ≤ B ≤ 10000 a.u. (see Table II). It turns out that for all studied magnetic ﬁelds the total

energy surface displays a minimum which corresponds to a linear parallel conﬁguration. Fur-

thermore, always this minimum appears in the symmetric conﬁguration R+ = R− ≡ R. For
this particular conﬁguration the variational trial function ψtrial (4) with σe = −1, σN = −1

and m = 0 is used which depends on ten variational parameters. Field-free case is studied

separately with 22-parametric trial function which is a linear superposition of (4) and its

two degenerations. It is separately checked that the linear parallel symmetric equilibrium

conﬁguration is stable towards all possible small deviations.

Table II shows the results for the total ET and the internuclear equilibrium distance Req

for the 3Σu state for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds. With an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld the

total energy decreases, the system becomes more bound - double ionization energy increases

[26] and more compact (the internuclear equilibrium distance decreases). A major emphasis

of our study of the state 3Σu is the domain 0.2 a.u. . B . 20 a.u. where this state becomes
the ground state of the H +

3 ion in parallel conﬁguration and likely the global ground state

of the ion.

As for the dissociation channel H +

3 (3Σu) → H +

2 (1σg) + H(1s) (with electrons in spin-

triplet state) the total energy of the ﬁnal state is slightly higher than ET (H +

3 ) for the
magnetic ﬁelds 0.2 a.u. . B . 20 a.u.; the energy diﬀerence varies from 0.03 Ry to 0.06 Ry

depending on a magnetic ﬁeld strength, see Table II remaining very small. Hence, although
3 (3Σu) is stable with respect to this dissociation channel it turns out to be a weakly bound

state. The dissociation may occur at B > 20 a.u. with photon emission at the ﬁnal state.

We do not mention a dissociation channel to H2(3Σu) + p due to a probable non-existence

of the H2 molecule in the domain 0.2 a.u. . B . 20 a.u. (see e.g. [17]).

In the domain 0.2 a.u. . B . 20 a.u. the total energy well corresponding to the 3Σu

state contains at least one longitudinal vibrational state (see Table II). Its energy grows

with a magnetic ﬁeld increase. It is calculated the lowest rotational energy as well as the

lowest bending energies using the same formulas as for H ++

[19]. All these energies grow

3

with a magnetic ﬁeld increase. The interesting observation is that for each magnetic ﬁeld in

the domain 1 a.u. < B . 20 a.u. the following hierarchy of these energies holds:

contrary to the hierarchy at 0.2 a.u. . B . 1 a.u.

Hence, the bending energy is the highest to the contrary the hierarchy at the ﬁeld-free case

where the longitudinal vibrational energy is the highest (see e.g. [23]),

A comparison of the total energies of the H +

3 ion the states 1Σg and 3Σu (see Tables I
and II) shows that at B ≈ 0.2 a.u. the energy crossing between these two states occurs.

It implies that for linear parallel conﬁguration the lowest energy state for B . 0.2 a.u.

is

the 1Σg state while for B & 0.2 a.u. the state 3Σu gets the lowest total energy becoming

the ground state in 0.2 a.u. . B . 20 a.u. (see below a description of Π and ∆ states).

However, the 3Σu state as a ground state is weakly bound - energy needed for dissociation to
H +

2 (1σg) + H(1s) with electron spins antiparallel to B is very small. It is worth emphasizing
the total energy of the global ground state given by a triangular

that at B ∼ 0.2 a.u.

conﬁguration coincides approximately to the total energies of the states 1Σg and 3Σu [14].

3.

3Σg state (S = 1, σN = 1)

In ﬁeld-free case the state 3Σg of the H +

3 ion in linear conﬁguration does not exist - the

total energy surface does not reveal a minimum or even irregularity which would correspond

to this state. However, when a magnetic ﬁeld is imposed this state may appear. It happens

already at B = 1 a.u. where the total energy surface ET (R+, R−) of this state displays a

well-pronounced minimum for linear parallel conﬁguration. A detailed variational study of
the state 3Σg of the H +
3 molecular ion in linear parallel conﬁguration is done for the domain
1 a.u.≤ B ≤ 10000 a.u. (see Table III). The trial function ψtrial (4) at σe = −1, σN = 1

and m = 0 is used for it which depends on eleven variational parameters.

The calculations indicate clearly the existence of a minimum in the total energy surface

ET (R+, R−) of H +

3 for all studied magnetic ﬁelds B = 1 − 10000 a.u. The minimum always

occurs for the symmetric conﬁguration R+ = R− ≡ R. The results are presented in Table III.

With an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the total energy decreases. The system

becomes more bound: the double ionization energy EI grows [26]. Also the system gradually

becomes more compact - the internuclear equilibrium distance gradually decreases.

1Σu state (S = 0, σN = −1)

Similar to the state 3Σg in the ﬁeld-free case the state 1Σu of the H +
3

ion in linear

conﬁguration does not exist. However, when a magnetic ﬁeld is imposed this state can

occur. Similar to the state 3Σg it happens already at B = 1 a.u. where the total energy

surface of this state displays a minimum. A detailed variational study of the state 1Σu of
the H +

3 molecular ion in linear parallel conﬁguration is done for 1 a.u.≤ B ≤ 10000 a.u.
(see Table IV). The trial function ψtrial (4) at σe = 1, σN = −1 and m = 0 is used for it

which depends on eleven variational parameters.

The variational calculations indicate clearly the existence of a minimum in the total

energy surface ET (R+, R−) of H +
3

for magnetic ﬁelds ranging B = 1 − 10000 a.u. The

minimum always occurs for the symmetric conﬁguration R+ = R− ≡ R.

In Table IV

the results for the total ET and double ionization energies (EI = 2B − ET ) as well as

the internuclear equilibrium distance Req are shown. With an increase of the magnetic

ﬁeld strength the total energy increases, the system becomes more bound (double ionization

energy increases) and gradually more compact (the internuclear equilibrium distance globally

decreases).

B. m = −1

For the case m = −1 four subspaces are studied: S = 0 (spin singlet states) and S = 1

(spin triplet states) with ms = −1, and parities σN = 1 and σN = −1, respectively. All

these states do not exist in the ﬁeld-free case.

3Πu state (S = 1, σN = 1)

The spin-triplet state 3Πu of the H +

for ﬁeld-free case. However, when a magnetic ﬁeld is imposed a minimum on the total

energy surface ET (R+, R−) can occur. This state is studied in the domain of magnetic ﬁelds
1 a.u.≤ B ≤ 4.414 × 1013 G using the variational trial function ψtrial (4) with σe = −1,

σN = 1 and m = −1. It depends on eleven variational parameters.

energy surface ET (R+, R−) of H +

The variational calculations indicate clearly the existence of a minimum in the total
3 for magnetic ﬁelds ranging B = 1 − 4.414 × 1013 G. The
minimum always corresponds to a linear parallel conﬁguration at R+ = R− ≡ R. It was

investigated its stability towards all possible small deviations in linear conﬁguration. Table V

contains the results for the total ET and the internuclear equilibrium distance Req. With

an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the total energy decrease, the system becomes

more bound (double ionization energy increases [26]) and more compact (the internuclear

equilibrium distance decreases).

We made an analysis of the total energies for all spin-triplet states. One can see that

there is a crossing between the 3Πu and the 3Σu states which occurs at B ≈ 20 a.u. It shows
that the ground state of H +

IV. CONCLUSION

We study the low-lying energy states of H +

3 molecular ion in linear conﬁguration parallel
to a magnetic ﬁeld from 0 up to 4.414 × 1013 G using the variational method in the Born-

Oppenheimer approximation. The total energy curves display a well pronounced minimum

at ﬁnite internuclear distances at R+ = R− for the lowest states with magnetic quantum

numbers m = 0, −1, −2, total spins S = 0, 1(ms = −1) and parity p = ±1. A level

distribution for several magnetic ﬁeld strengths is shown on Fig. 6.

If in ﬁeld-free case

there exist two states only in a linear conﬁguration, many more states in linear parallel

conﬁguration can appear when a magnetic ﬁeld is imposed.

In general, for all studied states as the magnetic ﬁeld increases the equilibrium internu-

clear distances Req decreases and the system becomes more compact, while the total energies

of spin-singlet states increase and of spin-triplet states decrease.

The state of the lowest total energy in linear parallel conﬁguration depends on the mag-

netic ﬁeld strength. It evolves from spin-singlet (unstable towards a deviation from linearity)

1Σg for weak magnetic ﬁelds B . 0.2 a.u. to spin-triplet (stable towards a deviation from

linearity) 3Σu for intermediate ﬁelds and eventually to spin-triplet 3Πu state for B & 20 a.u.

which remains the ground state until the Schwinger limit B = 4.414 × 1013 G. It is worth

21

emphasizing that for weak magnetic ﬁelds B . 0.2 a.u. the global ground state is given by a

triangular conﬁguration [14] and then, for larger magnetic ﬁelds, it appears in linear parallel
conﬁguration. The H +
3

ion in the 3Σu state is weakly bound. For all studied magnetic

ﬁelds the total energy surface well corresponding to the ground state contains at least one

longitudinal vibrational state.

What is the lowest-lying excited state for weak magnetic ﬁelds B . 0.2 a.u. is not clear

yet. This question and also the whole domain B . 0.2 a.u. will be studied elsewhere. In the

domain of magnetic ﬁelds 0.2 a.u. ≤ B ≤ 5 a.u. the lowest-lying excited state is 3Σg, then

for B & 5 a.u. the lowest-lying excited state is 3Πu. For B & 20 a.u. where the state 3Πu

becomes the ground state, the lowest-lying excited state is 3Σu. However, at B & 1000 a.u.

until the Schwinger limit the lowest-lying excited state is 3∆g.
It is interesting to note that at B ≈ 1000 a.u. the H +

3 ion exists with 3Πu as the ground
state (ET = −44.54 a.u.) with two excited states: 3∆g (ET = −40.38 a.u.) and 3Σu (ET =
for the energies below the threshold energy of dissociation to H2(3Πu) + p

−35.99 a.u.)
(ET = −35.44 a.u.). At B = 10000 a.u. the H +
3 ion (ET = −95.21 a.u.) supports the only
excited state 3∆g (ET = −87.45 a.u.) below the dissociation energy needed to dissociate
to H2(3Πu) + p (ET = −71.39 a.u.). Similar situation holds for the Schwinger limit B =
4.414 × 1013 G: the only excited state 3∆g lies below the dissociation threshold.

It is found that the many states in linear conﬁguration which do not exist for B = 0 a.u.

begin to be bound at relatively small magnetic ﬁeld B ≈ 0.2 a.u. A study of the existence

of the bound states which might appear in a spacial conﬁguration will be one of the goals of

a future study. Another goal will be related to a study of transition amplitudes for diﬀerent

states. Present consideration is based on the use of a variational trial function (4). This

function can be easily generalized and extended in a way how it was done in a variational

study of various one-electron systems in a strong magnetic ﬁeld (see [3]). It will allow to

improve presented results and will be done elsewhere.

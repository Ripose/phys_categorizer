The spectrum of higher harmonics in atoms calculated with a uniformized semiclassical propagator
is presented and it is shown that higher harmonic generation is an interference phenomenon which
can be described semiclassically. This can be concluded from the good agreement with the quantum
spectrum. Moreover, the formation of a plateau in the spectrum is speciﬁcally due to the interference
of irregular, time delayed, trajectories with regular orbits without a time-delay. This is proven by the
absence of the plateau in an artiﬁcial semiclassical spectrum generated from a sample of trajectories
from which the irregular trajectories (only a few percent) have been discarded.

The generation of higher harmonics (HHG) is an in-
triguing and experimentally well conﬁrmed phenomenon
which results from the non-linear response of a micro-
scopic system to a strong laser ﬁeld [1,2]. HHG has been
studied in simple but illustrative models numerically and
analytically [3–6], for reviews see [7,8]. Thereby, two
striking features have been identiﬁed, namely the occur-
rence of a “plateau”, i.e. the almost constant intensity
of the harmonics over a wide range of orders N , and the
sharp “cutoﬀ” at a certain maximum order Nmax of har-
monics. These features have been explained in terms of
a simple quasiclassical argument [4,5].

A closer inspection, however, reveals that only the cut-
oﬀ can be explained with this argument that involves a
phase matching condition for the semiclassical amplitude
imposing constraints on the actions of representative clas-
sical orbits. In the case of an initially bound electron one
obtains the intuitively appealing picture that the electron
must return to the nucleus in a certain time correlated
with the period (frequency) of the laser ﬁeld to generate
higher harmonics [4]. If the electron has too much energy
(which it would need to generate extremely high harmon-
ics) it is too fast to fulﬁll the matching condition. Hence,
the matching condition does explain the cutoﬀ, or more
precisely, it predicts that the conditions for HHG are un-
favorable for N > Nmax. On the other hand this does
not explain the existence and origin of the plateau for
N < Nmax since the cut oﬀ condition does not provide
a reason why the probability for HHG should be (almost
uniformly) high for N < Nmax as it is found in exper-
iments and in numerical simulations.
Indeed, only in
quantum simulations is the plateau found, classical sim-
ulations do not yield a plateau. This raises the question
whether the plateau is due to inherently quantum me-
chanical eﬀects, such as diﬀraction or tunneling, or if it

is a pure interference phenomenon that can be explained
semiclassically.

In order to answer this question one must carry out a
full semiclassical calculation of HHG which has not be
done so far. This is probably due to considerable techni-
cal diﬃculties since the chaotic dynamics of the explicitly
time dependent problem renders a standard semiclassical
treatment (even for one spatial degree of freedom) in the
framework of the van Vleck propagator [9] impossible.
However, using a uniformized propagator following the
ideas of Hermann and Kluk [10,11] we have succeeded
in obtaining a converged semiclassical spectrum of HHG.
Moreover, we are able (i) to prove that HHG is a pure
interference eﬀect, and (ii) to identify the diﬀerent types
of trajectories which interfere with each other.

We have performed our calculation with the “canon-
ical” model system for the interaction of a strong laser
ﬁeld with a one-electron atom, described by the Hamil-
tonian

is obtained by Fourier transform. Typically 106 trajec-
tories are necessary to converge d(t) from Eq. (6). For
comparison we have also determined d(t) quantum me-
chanically (Fig. 4) using standard Fast Fourier Transform
split operator methods (FFT) to compute the wavefunc-
tion Ψ(x, t).

Figure 1 demonstrates that a plateau and a cutoﬀ
are visible in the quantum (a), and in the semiclassi-
cal (c) harmonic spectrum, but not in the classical (b)
one. Since the semiclassical spectrum (b) and the quan-
tum spectrum (a) are very similar we may conclude that
HHG can be described semiclassically. Furthermore, the
absence of the plateau in the classical spectrum (b) sug-
gests that it is due to an interference eﬀect of diﬀerent
types of classical trajectories contributing to the semi-
classical result (c).

Among the classical trajectories from which the semi-
classical dipole acceleration Eq. (6) is constructed we can
distinguish trajectories which suﬀer a time delay when
passing the nucleus (i.e. x ≈ 0) from the “mainstream”
trajectories which are not slowed down. Furthermore,
among the time-delayed trajectories we can identify two
groups.

Trajectories of the ﬁrst group (dotted line in Fig. 2) get
“stranded” on top of the barrier of the eﬀective potential
Vef f (x) = V (x) − E0x. The second group is formed by
trajectories which become temporally “trapped”, (solid
line in Fig. 2). The trapped trajectories are chaotic in
the sense of an extreme sensitivity to a change in initial

with ∆ab = a − b, γ = 0.2236 a.u. and p0 = 0 a.u.. Under
these conditions of a scattering experiment the cutoﬀ for
HHG occurs at 2Up = E0/2ω2, see also [6] where the
same initial conditions have been used apart from the
width γ which does not occur there.

The Gaussian form of ψ(x, 0) allows one to express the
semiclassically propagated wavefunction in closed form

trajectories. The arrows indicate the range of the next higher enlargement.

Discarding only the trapped trajectories (0.6%) smears
out the cutoﬀ and leaves a reduced plateau for lower har-
monics (Fig. 5a). Hence, the quantitative semiclassical
reproduction of the quantum HHG spectrum together
with the absence of higher harmonics in the classical case
(Fig. 1) and in the semiclassical case if irregular, time-
delayed trajectories are discarded (Fig. 5) conﬁrms our
explanation of the origin of the higher harmonics.

To summarize we have shown that higher harmonic

conditions. This is clearly seen in the deﬂection function
qt(pi) (Fig. 3) where the ﬁnal position qt of a trajectory
at ﬁxed time t is plotted versus its initial momentum pi
[12].

One sees that in certain intervals of pi small changes
in pi lead to a completely diﬀerent qt with the result that
the deﬂection function exhibits a fractal structure. The
fractal initial conditions (for a ﬁxed ﬁnal qt) belong to
those trajectories which are trapped in the potential for
a certain dwell time (the solid lines in Fig. 2).

The time-delayed irregular orbits are responsible for
the higher harmonics since their contributions interfere
with those from the mainstream trajectories. The in-
terference manifests itself in a dephasing in the dipole
response d(t) of Eq. (6) after the ﬁrst encounter with the
nucleus (roughly after the time t = T ≡ 2π/ω for our ini-
tial conditions) as can be seen on Fig. 4b. At this time
the peak at about pi ≈ −.45 a.u., emerges in the deﬂec-
tion function, see Fig. 3. This corresponds to the return
of the nucleus in the case of an initially bound electron
as discussed, e.g., in [4,5]. The rich structure of this peak
emerges for longer times (see Fig. 3) necessary to resolve
the fractal dynamics on a ﬁne scale of the initial condi-
tions pi. The dephasing in d(t) is clearly an interference
phenomenon since it does not occur in the classical dipole
response (Fig. 4a).

Having identiﬁed the orbits, or equivalently, the ini-
tial conditions, which are responsible for the higher har-
monics we can artiﬁcially construct a harmonic spectrum
without those contributions to double check that they are
really responsible for HHG. This has been done in the
semiclassical spectrum of Fig. 5b where the time-delayed
trajectories (about 3% of all initial conditions) have been
discarded. Clearly, the plateau has disappeared and the
spectrum is similar to the purely classical spectrum with
trajectories for all initial conditions included (Fig. 1b).

accurate semiclassical computation rather diﬃcult. Re-
markably, despite the chaotic dynamics of the trapped
trajectories, one can obtain a converged semiclassical
spectrum if a proper semiclassical propagator such as the
Hermann-Kluk propagator is used which does not break
down at the (abundantly occuring) caustics. The result-
ing semiclassical harmonic spectrum agrees well with the
quantum spectrum.

We would like to thank O. Frank for the calculation
of the quantum spectrum and C. H. Keitel for helpful
discussions. Financial support from the DFG under the
Gerhard Hess-Programm and the SFB 276 is gratefully

generation can be interpreted as a semiclassical interfer-
ence eﬀect between regular and time-delayed trajectories
of the electron. The time-delay is either due to a tempo-
ral trapping which generates chaotic dynamics or due to
a stranding on top of the potential barrier. Along with
this time delay goes a characteristic diﬀerence in action
compared to the undelayed mainstream orbits. Analyt-
ical quasiclassical approximations of various kinds have
been used to derive this phase diﬀerence which can ex-
plain the cutoﬀ [4,5]. However, as demonstrated here,
the full semiclassical expression is far more complicated
since for the HHG spectrum chaotic trajectories exhibit-
ing a fractal deﬂection function are essential. The chaotic
character of the irregular orbits allows them to have a rel-
ative large eﬀect in comparison to their weight among all
initial conditions (of the order of 1%) because their in-
stability leads to a dramatic increase of their weight Rγ
in Eq. (5) in the course of time. This increase makes an

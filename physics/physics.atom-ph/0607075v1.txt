We theoretically examine two-color photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, focusing on
the role of rogue decoherence in the formation of macroscopic atom-molecule superpositions. Rogue
dissociation occurs when two zero-momentum condensate atoms are photoassociated into a molecule,
which then dissociates into a pair of atoms of equal-and-opposite momentum, instead of dissociating
back to the zero-momentum condensate. As a source of decoherence that may damp quantum
correlations in the condensates, rogue dissociation is an obstacle to the formation of a macroscopic
atom-molecule superposition. We study rogue decoherence in a setup which, without decoherence,
yields a macroscopic atom-molecule superposition, and ﬁnd that the most favorable conditions for
said superposition are a density ρ ∼ 1012 cm

−3 and temperature T ∼ 10

−10 K.

INTRODUCTION

Since the famous thought experiment by Schr¨odinger
[1], macroscopic superpositions have been a part of quan-
tum folklore that have annoyed specialists of the ﬁeld.
Schr¨odinger considered a cat that was sealed into a steel
chamber with a diabolic device that consists of a small
amount of radioactive material and a Geiger counter that
was attached to a hammer device. If one radioactive nu-
cleus would decay, then the Geiger counter would trigger
the hammer device, and the hammer device would scrap
a small bottle of Prussic acid which kills the cat. If the
problem is studied strictly quantum mechanically, from
outside the steel chamber, one ﬁnds that after a while the
cat would be in a superposition state of alive and dead.
If the cat would be in the statistical mixture of being
alive or dead, the situation would not diﬀer much from,
e.g., tossing a coin with the probability of 0.5 for heads
In a classical model, we do not yet know the
or tails.
outcome, but the state of the cat (coin) is either alive or
dead (heads or tails), even before the measurement. The
quantum cat (coin) behaves diﬀerently, with laws that
allow superpositions between the outcome alive and out-
come dead (heads and tails). Hence, rather than certain
alive or certain dead (heads or tails) before the measure-
ment, there must be quantum correlations between the
the two outcomes.

For Schr¨odinger, the reason for putting the cat in the
experimental spotlight was obvious. The absurd outcome
of the experiment illustrated that, if the outcome was a
result of treating everything–including the cat–strictly
quantum mechanically, something was wrong, if not in

the theory itself, then at least in the understanding quan-
tum mechanics. As previous decoherence studies have
shown [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], one should be wary of too
many oversimpliﬁcations and approximations. The en-
vironment of the cat should also be modelled, not only
a point-like cat in a vacuum. The interaction between
the cat and the environment induces decoherence that
damps quantum correlations out of the cat, resulting in
a classical statistical mixture of living and dead cat. In
other words, the cat is too macroscopic to be in a su-
perposition state. But what, then, is the upper limit of
macroscopicity for a superposition state?

Recent studies [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have pointed
out that the macroscopicity question can perhaps be
addressed with Bose-Einstein condensates. References
[9, 10, 11, 12] consider superpositions of two-component
atomic condensates, while dynamical creation of a macro-
scopic superposition between atomic and molecular con-
densates via photoassociation [13] or Feshbach resonance
[14] has also been studied. The work herein is a follow-
up study of [13], one that includes dissociative damp-
ing of quantum correlations. In particular, we consider
a macroscopic atom-molecule superposition created in a
two step process: ﬁrst, a joint atom-molecule conden-
sate is created from an initial atomic condensate with
strong photoassociation (compared to the s-wave colli-
sional interaction); second, the photoassociation coupling
is reduced, and a macroscopic atom-molecule superposi-
tion is created via strong s-wave collisions; observation
is based on a Rabi-like oscillation of the system between
the initial joint atom-molecule condensate and the cor-
responding macroscopic superposition. Here the main
concern is to determine whether or not dissociative de-
coherence prohibits the photoassociative formation of a
macroscopic atom-molecule superposition.

Photoassociation occurs when two atoms absorb a pho-

ton, thereby jumping from the two-atom continuum to a
bound molecular state [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25]. For initially quantum-degenerate atoms,
there is an analogy in nonlinear optics: photoassocia-
tion is formally identical to second-harmonic generated
photons [27], while s-wave collisions between the par-
ticles correspond to amplitude dispersion [28]; in each
case, the inherent non-linearity entangles the particles,
and potentially leads to macroscopic superpositions. In
photoassociation, however, the molecular state is excited
and may spontaneously decay to molecular levels out-
side the system; also, the molecule may dissociate either
back to the atomic condensate, or to a pair of nonconden-
sate atoms of equal and opposite momentum via rogue
[18, 19, 23, 29], i.e., unwanted [24, 25, 26], photodisso-
ciation. These problems can be overcome by coupling
the excited molecular state with a stable molecular state
using a second laser. In this two-color photoassociation,
the population loss via the excited molecular state can be
made small by applying suitably large intermediate de-
tunings. Nevertheless, decay of the quantum coherence
is still possible, even if the populations are unaﬀected,
and it is this possibility that warrents an invstigation of
rogue dissociation in macroscopic atom-molecule super-
positions.

In Ref.

The possible creation of a macroscopic atom-molecule
superposition using photoassociation was reported in
Calsamiglia et al. [13]. Although lacking decoherence ef-
fects, the results were promising and, moreover, Ref. [13]
is an interesting starting point for our study for several
other reasons: the possibility of a superposition of atom-
molecule condensates is tempting in itself, since atoms
and molecules are diﬀerent objects; the whole dynamical
process of creating the superposition state can be mod-
elled; the dissociation environment can be modelled in
a straightforward manner.
[14] the dynamical
approach has been used but, instead of photoassociation,
the macroscopic superposition state was created with the
help of a magnetic ﬁeld and Feshbach resonance. The
main source of decoherence was the laser-ﬁeld induced
interaction between atoms and the electromagnetic vac-
uum; however, the role of decoherence due to the cou-
pling between magnetic ﬁeld modes and the condensate
is unclear. Also, the study of Ref. [13] considers the case
of superposition very loosely. One cannot prove that the
state is a superposition state by using probability dis-
tributions only. Of course, the possibility of a Rabi-like
oscillations to and from the macroscopic superposition
[13], on which observation is based, is more likely in the
presence of quantum coherence; but, close revivals may
also occur for nearly statistical mixtures. In all rigor, a
detailed study of superposition states should include the
oﬀ-diagonal elements of the density matrix, including the
possibility of dissociative decoherence.

Hence, we focus on decoherence due to the second or-
der term of the master equation for the condensate modes
in the perturbation theory (anomalous quantum correla-
tions induced by the ﬁrst order term have been discussed

2

(1)

elsewhere [29]). Our results are roughly summarized as
follows. In general, the decoherence timescale τd should
be longer than the particular interaction timescale τi, and
thus macroscopic superpositions are possible only if the
condition

ξd =

>> 1

τd
τi

is fulﬁlled. Our scheme is divided into two phases in
which diﬀerent interactions are dominant.
In phase I,
we use photoassociation that is strong compared to colli-
sions to drive the initial atomic condensate into a partic-
ular joint atom-molecule which serves as an initial state
for the superposition engineering. Thus, the time scale τi
is the photoassociation timescale. In phase II, the inten-
sity of photoassociation laser is turned down, and dom-
inant collisions between condensate particles drive the
system into a macroscopic atom-molecule superposition.
The interaction timescale is then the collision timescale.
With the given simulation parameters we can express the
coherence condition as

does not depend on the number of particles in the initial
condensate, N : With the chosen theoretical setup and
parameter values, the photoassociation interaction, the
collision interaction, and the coupling between molecular
condensate and noncondensate modes depend similarly
on N ; thus, we ﬁnd that simulations for N = 1000 con-

The paper is outlined as follows.

In Section II we
sketch the photoassociation model given in Ref. [13] and
the interactions with the uncorrelated thermal cloud (the
environment). We calculate the time evolution of the re-
duced density matrix, i.e., the master equation for the
condensate modes only. Then, in Sec. III we assign ex-
plicit values to the model parameters and consider the
structure of our numerical analysis. The main results
are also presented there. Section IV is for summary and
discussion.

since only relative momentum is conserved. These non-

condensate atoms are denoted by ak, with a0 ≡
ing the condensate. The interactions that cause atom-
molecule and molecule-molecule transitions are charac-
terized by their respective Rabi frequencies Ωk = Ω1fk
and Ω2, where fk expresses the wavevector dependence
of the atom-molecule coupling. The one- and two-photon
i 1
detunings are ∆0 and δ = δ0 −
2 Γ, where the sponta-
neous decay rate, Γ, of the excited molecular state is in-
cluded in the one-photon (intermediate) detuning. This
scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1. We also consider s-wave
collisions between the atomic and stable-molecular con-
densates, with interaction strengths λaa, λgg, and λag.
Anticipating large intermediate detunings, the excited-
state molecular fraction is low, and its collisions can be
ignored; similarly, we also neglect all collisions with non-
condensate atoms. Thus, in the rotating wave approxi-
mation, the Hamiltonain for the above system is written

FIG. 1: Few-level illustration of free-bound-bound photoas-
sociation. Initially, N atoms are in the Bose-condensed state
|0i. The free-bound laser then removes two atoms from this
state and creates an electronically-excited molecule in the
state |1i. The bound-bound laser, in turn, removes an excited
molecule from the state |1i, and creates an electronically-
stable molecule in state |2i. The quasicontinuum of Nqc non-
condensate disociation modes is also shown, where a pair of
atoms with momentum ±~k and energy ~ǫk = ~2k2/2m are
taken to occupy the state |Ki ≡ |k, −ki. The free-bound
and bound-bound Rabi frequencies are Ωk = Ω1fk and Ω2,
where fk denotes the wavevector (energy) dependence of the
free-bound coupling. Lastly, the loss rate of the electronically-
excited molecular state is Γ, and the respective intermediate
and two-photon detunings are δ0 and ∆0.

Next, we proceed to derive the master equation [31, 32]
for the stable molecular condensate, applying the same
ideas as in Ref.
[29]. Using the interaction picture, the
problem is solved to second order in perturbation theory.
Taking the atom-molecule condensate as the system, and

quences that are not present in the original system (max-
imum momentum very large but ﬁnite), e.g., irreversible
dynamics. In our case it means that the coherence of the
system is decreasing monotonically. Here we have as-
sumed that the particles are in a free space. Of course, if
one wants to take the trap into account, one should add
here the density of the states of the trap. As the ﬁrst
approximation, we keep the system as simple as possible;
neglecting the trap can be justiﬁed by the fact that the
time scales of the trap are much longer than the assumed
decoherence time scale.

III. SIMULATIONS

The aim of the present work is to study the impact
of the rogue decoherence environment. It is important
to note that it is a matter of contention whether strong
two-color photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate
is even possible [39]. We insist that it is and, more-
over, that it is possible to target ground-electronic state
levels that are suﬃciently low-lying to allow neglect of
vibrational-relaxation losses (see also [33]) Our simula-
tions therefore consist of two stages: ﬁrst, a particular
joint-atom molecule condensate with real probability am-

plitude is created in the regime where photoassociation
is much stronger than collisions; second, the photoasso-
ciation intensity is reduced and the joint atom-molecule
condensate evolves under now-dominant collisional inter-
action into a macroscopic atom-molecule superposition.
Emipircally [13], we have found that the parameter
values that are suﬃcient to create the proper Phase-I
joint atom-molecule condensate are:

∆ = 0,
χ = 10√N λ,
φ = π/2.

(36)

(37)

(38)
(39)

By proper, we mean a joint atom-molecule condensate
with a real amplitude [13], which is the origin of the rel-
ative phase φ = π/2, and where half the original atoms
have been converted to molecules. The duration of the
strong two-photon-resonant photoassociation pulse is τ ,
which can be obtained from the solution of the semi-
classical approximation for the molecules [13], N/4 =
(N/2) tanh2(√N χτ ), which is a result borrowed from
the theory of second-harmonic-generated photons [27].
The condition ∆ = 0 means that the system is on a
Stark-shifted resonance and the Markov approximation
becomes dubious. On resonance, the interaction strength
compared to the evolution time scale increases and one
expects that decoherence would take a more dominant

simulations we have used a small but realistic temper-
ature T = 10−9K. Thus, the validity of the Markov
approximation requires ∆ > 131Hz. The nonzero de-
tuning, compared with zero detuning,
in the phase I
does not contribute much to the moment τ when phase
I ends. The generalized Rabi frequency [46] is χgen =

by N/4 = (N/2) tanh2(√N χτ )], but we instead optimize
the distance between the two superposition peaks, or, the
“size” of the superposition, to be a large as possible. An
optimal superposition size, and equally-sized probability
peaks, are obtained only if the phase I ends at the mo-
ment τ when Trρg†g
0.296N/2. This end point is very
sensitive: the accuracy in molecular fraction should be
0.001 in order to get equally sized peaks. Also, the

end point depends a bit on the particle number. The
above mentioned result is valid for N = 1000.

Phase II follows similar behavior, having the same
decoherence time as in Eq. (47). However, since colli-
sions are dominant in phase II, we compare the deco-
herence time in phase II with the collision time scale
(2N λ)−1. Hence, the decoherence condition is

If phase I results in suitable initial conditions to pro-
duce a macroscopic superposition in phase II, decoher-
ence in phase II is the only remaining thing to prevent
the superposition state. The correlations created by colli-
sions are the mechanism that, in ideal conditions, results
in a macroscopic superposition of atomic and molecular
condensates. Therefore, if the decoherence time scale is
smaller than the collisional time scale then decoherence
dominates over collisions and prohibits the creation of
the macroscopic superposition. The constraint to the su-
perposition here is ξd,II >> 1.

There are several damping scenerios to consider; al-

−2 when the superposition state

the probability distributions: stronger decoherence makes the
probability peaks lower and wider. Recall that the stage I
and II decoherence conditions for the various scenerios are
(A) ξd,I = ξd,II ≈ ∞; (B) ξd,I = 3.44 and ξd,II = 3.05;
(C) ξd,I = ξd,II = 1; and, (D)ξd,I = 10.88 and ξd,II = 9.65.

distributions of all scenarios at two diﬀerent instants of
time. The ﬁrst instant (t1) is when the phase I ends, and
a particular joint-atom molecule condensate with a real
probability amplitude is created. It serves most ideal ini-
tial conditions to begin the collision dominant phase II.
The second instant (t2) is when the superposition peaks
should emerge. Figure 3 presents the density matrices of
all scenarios at t1, and Fig. 4 the density matrices of all
scenarios at t2.

Overall, while decoherence is strong enough, the quan-
tum correlations are damped out and sharp peaks in
probability distributions smoothen. The decay of oﬀ-
diagonal elements seems to be considerable also in the
regime of moderate decoherence 1 < ξd < 6. Strong de-
coherence eﬀects ξd < 1 would be even faster. In order
to get a macroscopic superposition with the given setup,
one should be safely in the regime of weak decoherence,
i.e., ξd > 10. However, the regime is not reachable using
parameter values consistent with present-day technology.
Of course, there are a few possibilities to improve the re-
sult and get ξd > 10. First, one can reduce the density
ρ, but 1019m−3 is somewhat rariﬁed as it is, even for
1018m−3 could present
a condensate, and achieving 2
challenges. The second possibility is to enter the non-
Markovian regime, which could considerably improve the
ξd at least in phase I; however, the non-Markovian case
will be studied elsewhere. Other tricks are related to
manipulating the interaction or the environment. The
symmetrization of the environment [12] would be a hard,
maybe impossible, task to apply here due to the inherent
nonlinearity; but, creating specially a correlated environ-

ple, at least in the Markovian regime. While the system
is driven from superposition to the revived state, rogue
dissociation is still damping coherence out of the system.
Also, coherent tricks, such as phase-imprinting the re-
vived state, would need extra time, and this introduces
more decoherence. The best candidate for observing the
macroscopic superposition is probably to try to entangle
the superposition state with another system, and then to
apply Bell-type correlation experiments.

IV. DISCUSSION

The important point is that our approach is a dynam-
ical one in which we make the macroscopic superposition
in the presence of the decoherence, which diﬀers from the
standard way in which one takes the macroscopic super-
position for granted and then puts it into a decoherent
environment and looks how long it would last there. Such
studies do not make claims whether it is possible to cre-
ate a macroscopic superposition or not, but they only
make claims whether the initially prepared macroscopic
superposition can be observed or not. Therefore, our
photoassociation-based approach suggests a possible ex-
perimental creation of the macroscopic superposition in
a decohering environment.

Hence, the aim of this study is to understand the ef-
fects of the rogue-dissociation-induced decoherence while
trying to create a macroscopic superposition of Bose-
condensed atoms and molecules.
In particular, ours is
a two-stage scheme: in the ﬁrst stage, the photoassocia-
tion coupling is strong compared to the s-wave collisional
coupling, and a speciﬁc joint atom-molecule condensate
is created; in the second stage, the photoassociation cou-
pling is turned down such that it is weak compared to
the collisional coupling, and the system evolves into a
macroscopic atom-molecule superposition. There is a
constraint ξd >> 1, which should be satisﬁed in order to
get a macroscopic superposition of atoms and molecules.
The dependency on relevant system parameters of the
constraint ξd was calculated in both stages of our theo-
retical setup. An interesting fact is that, for the given
parameter ratios, ξd does not depend on the number of
particles in condensate N . Results for a modest, say,
N = 1000 particle superposition state will therefore ap-
ply to a N = 109 particle superposition state with the
same density, given properly scaled laser frequencies and
intensities. Using ξd one can easily, without heavy simu-
lations, consider whether the macroscopic superposition
state of atoms and molecules is within reach or not with
given experimental setup parameters.

Without any tricks, the best chance to defeat rogue
decoherence in creating an atom-molecule superposition
1018 m−3 and temper-
corresponds to a density ρ = 2
0.1 nK. Nevethless, while this temperature
ature T
may be accessible by making the trap shallow, the oﬀ-
diagonal elements of density matrix will still experience
considerable decay. One way to get better macroscopic

ing), B (b, moderate damping), C (c, strong damping) and
D (d, weak damping) at the end of stage I at t1. Deco-
herence eﬀects are clearly visible in scenarios B and C, as
the decay of oﬀ-diagonal elements has resulted in ellipsoid-
gaussian wave packet. Again, recall the decoherence condi-
tions: A, ξd,I = ξd,II ∼ ∞; B, ξd,I = 3.44 and ξd,II = 3.05;
C ξd,I = ξd,II = 1; and D, ξd,I = 10.88 and ξd,II = 9.65.

elements have survived from decoherence, even in the sce-
−10K
nario D, that has extreme parameter values of T = 10
−3. Again, recall the decoherence conditions:

ξd,I = ξd,II = 1; and D, ξd,I = 10.88 and ξd,II = 9.65.

ment might help since an uncorrelated heat bath is quite
a harsh environment for coherence phenomena.

Finally, we note that the observation of the possible
superposition state could present a problem. The as-
sumption that the coherence of the state after phase I
can be veriﬁed, and thus one only needs to consider the
density matrix proﬁles of the revival of this initial state
after the superposition state [13, 14], is perhaps too sim-

superpositions in the present scheme is to challenge the
assumptions or approximations of our study or, in other
words, engineer the environment. We assumed that the
environment is an uncorrelated heat bath, the system
parameter values should be in the regime where Markov
approximation is valid, the environment particles are free
and the environment is inﬁnite. Indeed, it may well prove
interesting to examine the non-Markovian regime, where
a greater part of the physically-relevant parameter space
is available, and/or to use a specially correlated environ-
ment.

Rogue dissociation is an important source of decoher-
ence that should not be neglected in coherence studies
of atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensates. Unfortu-

nately, it seems to push coherent atom-molecule engineer-
ing (macroscopic superpositions, quantum computation,
etc.) one step further away from realization.

Abstract

Theories unifying gravity with other interactions suggest spatial and temporal
variation of fundamental “constants” in the Universe. A change in the ﬁne struc-
ture constant, α = e2/~c, could be detected via shifts in the frequencies of atomic
transitions in quasar absorption systems. Previous studies of three independent sam-
ples of data, containing 143 absorption systems spread from 2 to 10 billion years
after big bang, hint that α was smaller 7 – 11 billion years ago [1,2].

To continue this study we urgently need accurate laboratory measurements of
atomic transition frequencies. In this paper, we present a current list of transitions
of importance to the search for α variation. They are E1 transitions to the ground
state in several diﬀerent atoms and ions, with wavelengths ranging from around 900
– 6000 ˚A, and require an accuracy of better than 10−4 ˚A. We also discuss isotope
shift measurements that are needed in order to resolve systematic eﬀects in the
study.

Researchers who are interested in performing these measurements should contact

the authors directly.

constants in the Universe (see, for example the review [3]). Several studies
have tried to probe the values of constants at earlier stages in the evolution
of the universe. One method compares atomic transition frequencies on Earth
and in quasar (QSO) absorption spectra, and recent studies of these spec-
tra have revealed hints that the ﬁne structure constant, α, was smaller in
the early universe [1]. The latest results of this group, which combine data
from 128 absorption systems over the redshift range 0.2 < zabs < 3.7, show
∆α/α = (−0.543 ± 0.116) × 10−5 [2]. However, attempts to replicate this re-
sult using a similar analysis, but diﬀerent data sets from diﬀerent telescopes,
indicate no variation of α [4,5].

To continue this work and resolve the discrepancies, several new transitions
are being considered. In Table 1 we present a list of lines commonly observed
in high-resolution QSO spectra. All of these lines are important for studies of
α variation, but lack the necessary high-accuracy laboratory measurements.
Note that the oscillator strengths presented are not accurate. Predominantly,
these wavelengths come from the compilation [6] and have errors of about
0.005 ˚A, although it is possible that some errors are closer to 0.05 ˚A. As a
general rule, the lines are more important for α variation if they lie above
1215.67 ˚A(the Lyman-α line of hydrogen) due to the “Lyman-α forest” seen
in QSO spectra.

Isotope shift measurements for these transitions are also needed in order to
resolve a source of systematic error in the variation of α studies: the isotope
abundance ratios in the gas clouds sampled in the quasar absorption spectra
may not match those on Earth [7]. Accurate measurements of the isotope
shift are required to quantify these systematic eﬀects. They can also be used
to determine the abundances in the early universe directly, to test models of
nuclear processes in stars. In addition to the transitions listed in Table 1, there
are those lines that were used in previous studies, but for which the isotopic
structure has not been measured. These transitions are presented in Table 2.

We have calculated the diﬀerence between the transition frequencies in QSO
spectra (ω) and in the laboratory (ω0) [8]. The frequency dependence on
changes in α is given by the formula ω = ω0 + qx, where x = (α/α0)2 − 1.
The relativistic energy shifts, or q-values, are calculated using atomic physics
codes. The atomic energy levels are calculated to a ﬁrst approximation using
relativistic Hartree-Fock (Dirac-Hartree-Fock). Higher order eﬀects are taken
into account using many-body perturbation theory for single-valence-electron
systems, or using conﬁguration interaction for many-valence-electron systems.
Both methods assume a frozen Hartree-Fock core. The value of α is varied
in the computer codes and the energy levels are recalculated, and hence the
transition frequencies. The q-values are extracted as

q =

dω
dx

(cid:12)

We also account for complications due to level pseudo-crossing [9].

Table 1: High-priority lines observed in QSO spectra. The
ﬁrst column is the ion; the second and third columns
are the rest wavelength and the transition frequency, re-
spectively; the fourth column is the oscillator strength;
the relativistic shift (q-value) is shown in the ﬁfth col-
umn, where known (these are calculated in Ref. [8]). The
relative importance of the transition for determining α-
variation is also shown (A = very important; B = mildly
important).

We propose to observe the Eﬁmov eﬀect experimentally
by applying an external electric ﬁeld on atomic three-body
systems. We ﬁrst derive the lowest order eﬀective two-body
interaction for two spin zero atoms in the ﬁeld. Then we solve
the three-body problem and search for the extreme spatially
extended Eﬁmov states. We use helium trimers as an illus-
trative numerical example and estimate the necessary ﬁeld
strength to be less than 2.7 V/˚A.

Introduction. The Eﬁmov eﬀect [1] is an interesting
anomaly in a three-body system with short-range inter-
actions.
If at least two of the binary subsystems have
an s-state at zero energy (or equivalently an inﬁnitely
large scattering length) the three-body system develops
an inﬁnite series of bound states. The binding energies
of these states are exponentially small and the spatial
extension is correspondingly exponentially large [2].

A peculiar feature of these states is that their number
decreases when the modulus of the scattering length is
decreased by either weakening or strengthening the two-
body potentials. For a given scattering length a and ef-
fective range re the number of bound three-body states
is proportional to log (
/re). This number becomes in-
a
|
|
ﬁnitely large also when the eﬀective range approaches
zero, which in this limit is called the Thomas eﬀect [3].
Although the Thomas eﬀect has only theoretical inter-
est, the Eﬁmov eﬀect might be observed experimentally
in a suitable weakly bound three-body system. Candi-
dates for the Eﬁmov eﬀect are Borromean (that is with-
out bound subsystems) halo nuclei, occurring at the neu-
tron drip-line [4], and molecular systems like the atomic
helium trimers [5–7]. For the 4He-trimer two bound
states are predicted with the excited state resembling an
Eﬁmov state. The ratio
/re is in this case around 14.
|
The excited state disappears when the interaction is ei-
ther weakened by 3% or strengthened by 20%. So far
other examples are not available since the condition of
the exceedingly large scattering length is hard to meet.
This diﬃculty could be overcome if one could gradually
alter the two-body potentials, thus adjusting the scatter-
ing length to the needed condition. An already large
scattering length is very sensitive to small variations of
the potential and the needed alteration should therefore
be relatively small. Such tuning of the scattering length
in an external magnetic ﬁeld was recently suggested for
a system of two rubidium atoms [8]. A corresponding
Feshbach resonance at zero energy was subsequently ob-

a

served experimentally [9]. Another similar resonance has
also been observed for a system of two sodium atoms [10].
However corresponding investigations of three-body sys-
tems do not exist. We have therefore undertaken the ﬁrst
investigation of a three-body system in an external ﬁeld
with the main emphasis on the Eﬁmov eﬀect.

So far the most promising candidate for the Eﬁmov ef-
fect is believed to be the system of three helium atoms.
For the noble atoms, unlike the alkali atoms, the elec-
tric rather than magnetic ﬁeld seems to be most suitable
instrument. In this letter we suggest to use an external
electric ﬁeld as a tool to modify the interaction between
noble atoms. We shall consider examples of helium iso-
topes and estimate the electric ﬁeld strength needed to
reach the Eﬁmov limit. We shall investigate the problem
of three helium atoms in an external electric ﬁeld and
estimate the properties of the lowest Eﬁmov states. We
shall also discuss the feasibility of an experiment observ-
ing the Eﬁmov eﬀect in atomic or molecular three-body
systems.

Three-body system in an external ﬁeld. An external
ﬁeld breaks the rotational symmetry and a precise com-
putation of the Eﬁmov states is exceedingly diﬃcult. It
is already diﬃcult for systems with well deﬁned angular
momentum [4]. We shall therefore assume that our bi-
nary subsystems are already close to the threshold and
that the needed external ﬁeld is weak enough to justify
a perturbative treatment of the problem.

We can not, however, apply the perturbation theory
directly to the three-body problem since notwithstand-
ing its weakness, this perturbation supposedly leads to a
signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the spectrum – appearance of
an inﬁnite series of bound states.

On the other hand on the two-body level this pertur-
bation only slightly modiﬁes the binary interactions. Our
strategy is therefore to estimate perturbatively the vari-
ation of the potential between atoms exposed to an ex-
ternal ﬁeld and then solve the three-body problem with
the modiﬁed potentials.

Correction to the two-body potential. We shall now
calculate the total energy of the system of two atoms
exposed to a weak static external electric ﬁeld. One of
the terms in this energy is, within the usual adiabatic
approximation, the sought correction to the potential.

The Hamiltonian of a system of two atoms separated

by a ﬁxed distance r in an external static electric ﬁeld
can be written in the dipole approximation as

Both terms in this two-body interaction are of second
order in the external ﬁeld. They diﬀer in the radial de-
pendence and the order of the polarizability. The ex-
tra polarizability factor and the faster radial fall oﬀ of
the second term produce a relatively smaller contribu-
tion. The terms with Y20 break the rotational symmetry
and couple diﬀerent angular momenta. The individual
properties of the two-body system determine the relative
contribution of the two terms. Since both terms resulted
from the second order perturbation treatment they must
lower the ground state energy of the two-body system.

Numerical examples. To observe the Eﬁmov eﬀect in-
troduced by an external ﬁeld we have to select a three-
body system where at least two of the binary subsystems
are almost bound in relative s-states and the third sub-
system is unbound. The atomic helium trimers seem to
oﬀer an interesting and realistic possibility where the nec-
essary properties are present and accurately known, i.e.
4He2 is weakly bound and 3He4He is marginally unbound
[5–7]. Thus the 4He3He2 system is a realistic candidate
where the external ﬁeld then may provide the additional
energy needed to bind 3He4He.
It would probably be
even more advantageous to aim for three identical bosons.
We use the local and central potential LM2M2 as the
free-space interaction between He atoms [13] and the po-
10−
larizability is β = 0.2050

The free-space interaction is LM2M2 [13]. The induced inter-
action is from Eq.(10) where the solid curves include all terms
and the dotted curves only include the ﬁrst term.

Although the eﬀective two-body interaction in Eq.(10)
breaks the rotational symmetry, the decisive s-wave scat-
tering length can still be calculated as function of the
strength of the ﬁeld. The result for 3He4He is shown in
Fig. 1, where an inﬁnite scattering length appears at
=
0.053 a.u. Thus an s-state at zero energy is produced by
this external ﬁeld at this point, i.e. the Eﬁmov conditions
are fulﬁlled for the three-body system 4He3He2. In Fig.1
we also see that the last term in Eq.(10) is rather small
for the present set of parameters. Other systems with
larger polarizability may produce a zero energy s-state
for substantially smaller ﬁelds.

E

For the 3He2 system the scattering length is roughly
constant (
14 a.u.) over the range of the ﬁeld strength
in Fig. 1. The related divergence and the bound s-state
appears at
= 0.067 a.u. Such strong ﬁelds are possible
to obtain with todays femto-second lasers [14].

Accurate computations are unfortunately rather diﬃ-
cult even without an external ﬁeld [5–7]. However, to
assess the possibility of the eﬀect an order of magnitude

estimate should be made before more elaborate eﬀorts
are mobilized. The three-body bound state energies can
be obtained with a smaller numerical eﬀort and a rela-
tive accuracy better than 50% by use of simple attractive
gaussian two-body interactions with the correct s-wave
scattering lengths [7]. We choose realistic range parame-
ters and for a given strength of external ﬁeld adjust the
depth of the gaussian to reproduce the scattering lengths
shown in Fig. 1 for 3He4He. The accuracy of the result-
ing three-body binding energies relative to the strength
of the potential is around 10−

0.053 a.u.) the ﬁrst excited state appears with a binding
energy quickly increasing to about 1 mK. The root mean
square radii correspondingly decrease from inﬁnity at the
thresholds to about 10 a.u. and 200 a.u., respectively.
Inﬁnitely many bound three-body states with behavior
similar to these lowest states must appear at the two-
body threshold.

An electric ﬁeld of 0.053 a.u.=2.7 V/˚A induces a dipole
moment of 0.074 a.u. which corresponds to the displace-
ment of the center of the electron cloud by approximately
0.04 a.u.
from the nucleus. This might involve a sub-
stantial change of the electronic structure of the atom
and the original Van der Waals interaction would there-
fore also change. However it is not unlikely that a more
accurate calculation, consistently including these eﬀects,
would produce Eﬁmov conditions already for a weaker

sary to reach the occurrence conditions for the Eﬁmov
eﬀect and found it on the limit of present day technology.
However, it is conceivable that other systems are closer
to the threshold and therefore are better suited candi-
dates. Appropriate realistic systems should be searched
for and investigated. We shall here be content with the
demonstration that the idea of controlled creation of the
occurrence conditions for the spectacular Eﬁmov states
is entirely feasible.

external ﬁeld.

Observing the eﬀect. Better suited systems can prob-
ably be found. However almost inevitably two identi-
cal particles are needed, since their identical scattering
lengths against the third particle can then be tuned si-
multaneously. The two-body subsystems should all be
unbound but as near as possible to the threshold for
binding. Two atoms of naturally occurring isotopes are
almost always bound in a dimolecule. More complicated
molecules therefore seem to be needed, but then the num-
ber of combinations also become virtually inﬁnitely large.
It is in this connection interesting that new atomic neg-
atively charged three-body structures recently were sug-
gested [15].

Providing the Eﬁmov conditions must be supple-
mented by production and detection of these states either
by their decay or by increased scattering cross sections.
The binding energies are exceedingly small and probably
beyond the sensitivity and resolution of the experimen-
tal equipment. On the other hand the spatial extension
seems to be a directly accessible observable. A grid with
holes of variable sizes is a direct tool to determine the ra-
dius of the created three-body state [16]. The intensity of
appropriate systems passing the grid then changes dras-
tically when the Eﬁmov states constitute a substantial
part of the molecular bound states hitting the grid.

Detailed design of an experiment is beyond the scope
of the present letter. However, a sketch of an experi-
ment could be to let a beam of a Borromean system in
its ground state pass into a region with an external elec-
tric ﬁeld. By photon absorption the system must then be
excited into the Eﬁmov states which would be stopped
at the grid. The Eﬁmov eﬀect might also manifest itself
in a number of resonances in a three-body system which
is slightly oﬀ the two-body threshold. Scattering experi-
ments could then provide the decisive detection signals.
Conclusion. Weakly bound three-body systems inter-
acting via short-range two-body potentials may exhibit
spectacular properties exempliﬁed by Borromean systems
and the Eﬁmov eﬀect. The latter occurs when the scat-
tering lengths are suﬃciently large, or equivalently the
virtual or bound two-body s-states are suﬃciently close
to zero. A number of excited states would then appear
with very small binding energies and correspondingly
large spatial extensions. The occurrence conditions for
these Eﬁmov states are rather sharply deﬁned and even
the lowest of these peculiar states is diﬃcult to localize.
It would be a tremendous advantage if the appropriate
two-body interactions could be adjusted to meet the nec-
essary conditions. We propose an external electric ﬁeld
as the vehicle for ﬁne tuning the eﬀective two-body inter-
action to produce a zero energy s-state. The three-body
computation with this ﬁeld dependent two-body interac-
tion then reveals the Eﬁmov states at a particular ﬁeld
strength. As an illustration we used the atomic helium
trimer systems. We estimated the ﬁeld strength neces-

We demonstrate the possibility of three-dimensional cool-
ing of neutral atoms by illuminating them with two counter-
propagating laser beams of mutually orthogonal linear polar-
ization, where one of the lasers is a speckle ﬁeld, i.e. a highly
disordered but stationary coherent light ﬁeld. This conﬁgu-
ration gives rise to atom cooling in the transverse plane via
a Sisyphus cooling mechanism similar to the one known in
standard two-dimensional optical lattices formed by several
plane laser waves. However, striking diﬀerences occur in the
spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients as well as in local properties of
the trapped atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of speckle laser patterns, as created when
a highly coherent light beam is transmitted through or
reﬂected from an object with a surface which is rough
on the scale of the laser wavelength, was initiated many
years ago using electromagnetic theory [1] and statistical
methods [2,3]. Since then, this subject has raised more
and more interest, resulting in a vast development of the
theory (for a survey of the most recent results, see e.g.
[4]) as well as experimental achievements. These give
rise to important applications of laser speckles in various
ﬁelds of science, such as the speckle reduction in imagery
[5], roughness measurements in material science [6], or
applications in bio-physics [7].

The scope of the work presented here is to investigate
the application of such speckle laser ﬁelds in the context
of laser cooling of neutral atoms. We are especially in-
terested in the disordered analog of the so-called optical
lattices formed by several laser plane waves, which yield
periodic optical potentials and have been demonstrated
experimentally to give rise to eﬃcient laser cooling by a
Sisyphus-type mechanism [8–10]. The basic principle of
this cooling scheme is that the atoms loose kinetic en-
ergy by running up potential hills from where they are
optically pumped into lower lying potential wells. Re-
cent experiments have also demonstrated a similar cool-
ing scheme in the case of laser conﬁgurations forming
quasi-periodic optical lattices [11], which can be viewed
as an intermediate regime between the standard periodic
lattices and the completely disordered patterns obtained
from speckle light ﬁelds.

We consider two counterpropagating laser ﬁelds of mu-
tually orthogonal polarization, where one of the beams is
a speckle ﬁeld. According to the randomly distributed

1

phase and intensity gradients of the speckle ﬁeld in
all dimensions we ﬁnd three-dimensional Sisyphus cool-
ing even with this one-dimensional beam conﬁguration.
Moreover, interesting transport phenomena are found in
this case, e.g., a large diﬀerence in the spatial diﬀusion of
the atoms even in parameter regimes where the steady-
state temperatures are of the same order of magnitude
for the longitudinal and the transverse directions. Other
eﬀects, such as local radiation pressure forces, arise also
from the fact that amplitude and phase of the speckle
ﬁeld are essentially independent.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we qualita-
tively discuss our proposed setup and the basic physical
processes which give rise to the cooling mechanism. Fur-
thermore we discuss the dependence of the steady-state
temperature on various system parameters. In Sec. III we
present the details of the theory and outline the numer-
ical methods, especially the semiclassical Monte-Carlo
simulations, to obtain the results. Sec. IV is attributed
to the analysis of the numerically obtained results such
as temperatures, spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients and local
eﬀects in the light ﬁeld. Finally, in Sec. V we discuss the
diﬀerences of the cooling in the laser propagation direc-
tion and in the transverse plane.

II. QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION

Throughout this paper we will discuss the simple situa-
tion of a single atom with a ground state of total angular
momentum F = 1/2 and an excited state with F ′ = 3/2
interacting with two counterpropagating laser ﬁelds of or-
thogonal polarization. In the case of both laser ﬁelds be-
ing plane waves this gives rise to well-known sub-Doppler
cooling mechanisms in one dimension (1D) [12]. Because
of the modulation of the optical potential, trapping of
atoms in the longitudinal direction has been predicted
[13] and observed [14]. In contrast, the atoms are free in
the transverse plane.

In the situation discussed here, one of the laser ﬁelds
is replaced by a speckle ﬁeld, i.e., by a highly disordered,
but nevertheless stationary and coherent light ﬁeld. Such
a speckle ﬁeld can be easily generated experimentally, for
instance, by introducing a diﬀusor into the path of a laser
plane wave. The resulting light ﬁeld shows highly disor-
dered intensity and phase distributions (for a discussion
of the statistical properties of speckle ﬁelds see e.g. [2]).
An example of a computer-generated speckle ﬁeld on a
discrete spatial grid is shown in Fig. 1.

We have investigated two diﬀerent possible setups for

the polarizations of the counterpropagating light ﬁelds,
namely the case of two mutually orthogonal linearly po-
larized ﬁelds (lin⊥lin conﬁguration) and the case of two
opposite circular polarizations (σ+ − σ− conﬁguration).
For the lin⊥lin conﬁguration one ﬁnds in the laser
propagation direction essentially the usual 1D Sisyphus
cooling mechanism [12] apart from the diﬀerent spatial
variation of intensity and phase of the speckle ﬁeld as
compared to a plane wave. Additionally, the properties
of the speckle ﬁeld give rise to Sisyphus cooling of the
atom in the transverse plane, since the phase and in-
tensity modulations in these directions lead to spatially
varying light shifts and optical pumping rates of the Zee-
man sublevels of the atomic ground state. Thus, the two
counterpropagating laser beams (one plane wave and one
speckle ﬁeld) allow for three-dimensional cooling of the
atom, in sharp contrast to the 1D lin⊥lin optical lattices
used so far.

Sisyphus cooling in the plane orthogonal to the laser
propagation direction works analogously in the σ+ − σ−
conﬁguration. However, for an F = 1/2 to F ′ = 3/2
atomic transition, Sisyphus cooling in the longitudinal
direction is expected to be much less eﬃcient since the
optical potentials of the ground state sublevels change on
a much larger length scale in this direction (if the typical
length size of the speckle in the transverse direction is
dsp, the size along the propagation (longitudinal) axis is
d2
sp/λ, where λ is the laser wavelength). Furthermore,
the σ+ − σ− cooling scheme [12] is eﬃcient only if F ≥ 1.
In these two conﬁgurations the most striking diﬀerence
to the conﬁguration of counterpropagating plane waves
will be found in the transverse plane. Hence in the re-
mainder of this paper we will mainly restrict ourselves to
a 2D model of cooling in the transverse directions and
will only brieﬂy discuss the changes induced by a model
including the longitudinal direction in Sec. V.

As an example we plot the steady-state temperature
reached in this 2D subsystem versus the optical poten-
tial depth ¯h∆′ for ﬁxed optical pumping rate γ′ in Fig. 2,
where ∆′ and γ′ for the speckle ﬁeld are deﬁned with re-
spect to the mean intensity of the beam. The numerical
method to obtain these results will be described in detail
in Sec. III. As our ﬁrst and most important result we
note that, as expected from the previous discussions, the
atoms reach a steady-state temperature in the transverse
plane. Secondly, the general behavior of this steady-state
temperature as a function of the optical potential depth
resembles very much the case of the standard optical lat-
tices consisting of plane laser waves, i.e., for large val-
ues of ∆′ one ﬁnds a linear dependence and hence the
steady-state kinetic energy becomes constant relative to
the depth of the optical potentials in this limit. On the
other hand, the temperature increases dramatically with
small, decreasing values of ∆′ and, ﬁnally, below a cer-
tain threshold value of ∆′ no steady-state temperature
is achieved. Consequently, one ﬁnds the lowest absolute
values for the steady-state temperature for intermediate
values of the optical potential depth.

According to this similarity with standard optical lat-
tices we may roughly estimate the steady-state tempera-
ture of the atoms in the speckle ﬁeld from the formula

kBT =

D
α

,

(1)

where D is a mean momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient and
α a mean friction coeﬃcient [15]. Note that this formula
only holds in the absence of atomic localization, which
is not the case here as we will see later, but nevertheless
gives a useful order of magnitude for the temperature.
The friction coeﬃcient will be of the order of

α ∼ ¯hk2

λ
dsp (cid:19)
where ∆ is the detuning of the laser from the atomic reso-
nance frequency, Γ is the natural linewidth of the excited
state, and dsp is the mean distance of neighboring inten-
sity maxima along a 1D cut through the speckle ﬁeld,
i.e. the typical length scale of the speckle ﬁeld. Eq. (2)
is obtained from the well-known expression for standard
lattices [12,16] where we have only replaced the factors of
λ by dsp, which accounts for the diﬀerent typical length
scale.

The momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be guessed as

D = Ddip + Dse ∼ ¯h2k2

(3)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
which contains the diﬀusion Ddip due to the ﬂuctuating
dipole force and the diﬀusion Dse due to the recoil of the
spontaneously emitted photons. Ddip is approximately
given by the square of a typical force, ¯hk(λ/dsp)(∆/Γ),
times a typical time, 1/γ′, and Dse has the same form as
for a standard lattice. Hence the estimated temperature

This formula exactly predicts the qualitative behavior of
the temperature in Fig. 2, i.e. the linear increase for large
values of ∆′ and a rapid increase for very small values. It
also shows that the lowest value of T (= Tmin) is achieved
for ∆′/γ′ = dsp/λ and that kBTmin = 2¯hγ′dsp/λ. For a
ﬁxed optical pumping rate γ′, the minimum temperature
is thus expected to increase linearly with the speckle size.
Finally, one notes from Fig. 2 that, although both the
lin⊥lin and the σ+ − σ− conﬁguration give rise to cool-
ing, the lin⊥lin setup is more eﬃcient and hence gives
rise to lower temperatures. For the chosen parameters
the diﬀerence in temperature between these two setups
is about a factor of two in the vicinity of the threshold
value for the optical potential depth and is smaller for
larger values of ∆′.

Another important diﬀerence between the laser cool-
ing inside a speckle ﬁeld as discussed here and standard

2

optical lattices created by several plane waves lies in the
tunability of the typical length scale. For our setup the
mean speckle grain size dsp can be changed continuously
by changing the position of the diﬀusor which creates the
speckle ﬁeld out of a plane laser wave.

As an example, Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the
steady-state temperature on dsp for the lin⊥lin as well
as for the σ+ − σ− conﬁguration. One clearly sees
an increase of the temperature for larger speckle sizes.
Eqs. (2)-(4) explain these feature since we note that the
friction force decreases as 1/d2
sp, but only the dipole
diﬀusion term Ddip has the same dependence, whereas
the sponaneous emission term Dse remains constant.
Hence the latter contribution of the total diﬀusion starts
to dominate for large speckle sizes (more precisely for
dsp/λ ≫ ∆′/γ′), and hence the temperature is expected
to increase quadratically with the speckle size. However,
for the parameters chosen in Fig. 3 (∆′/γ′ = 15 ) the tem-
perature increases only by a factor of two, if the speckle
grain size is increased from about λ to 12λ. But as we
will discuss later in Sec. IV, the increase, for instance, of
the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which is equal to D/α2
in a certain range of parameters [17], is much larger.

Again the qualitative behavior of the σ+ − σ− conﬁg-
uration is the same as that of the lin⊥lin conﬁguration.
Thus in the remainder of the paper we will only focus on
the latter situation, since it is more appropriate for a 3D
cooling mechanism as discussed previously.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

In this section we give a more detailed discussion of the
mathematical model and the numerical methods used to
obtain the results presented in this paper.

A. Speckle ﬁelds

The ﬁrst step for all the numerical treatments is to
create a speckle ﬁeld. This can be easily implemented
on a computer following the procedure described in the
work of Huntley [18], which we will brieﬂy outline in the
following.

Let us denote the electric ﬁeld at the diﬀusor by
E1(x, y) and the electric ﬁeld at the plane chosen for the
numerical simulations by E2(x, y). The two ﬁelds are re-
lated according to the Huygens-Fresnel principle in the
Fresnel approximation by

E2(x, y) =

Following [2] the real and imaginary part of E′

these two quantities are related by a Fourier transform.
2(x, y) at
any point (x, y) are independent Gaussian random vari-
ables. Thus the numerical construction of a speckle ﬁeld
starts by ﬁlling the real and imaginary parts of E′
2(x, y)
on a discrete spatial grid of N × N points with random
numbers from a Gaussian distribution of zero mean and
unit standard deviation. The grid size N must be chosen
in such a way that it contains a reasonable large number
of speckle grains, but nevertheless the discretized ﬁeld
must be smooth enough in order not to introduce large
numerical errors. In practice we have used values of N
between 64 and 256 for our calculations.

The eﬀect of the ﬁnite size of the diﬀusor is imple-
mented by transforming E′
1(x, y), multiply-
ing the latter quantity by a window function W (x, y)
which assumes unity inside the diﬀusor and vanishes
otherwise, and transforming the result back into a ﬁnal
E′

2(x, y) into E′

2,ﬁn(x, y), i.e.,

E′

2,ﬁn = F −1(W F (E′

2)),

(8)

where F denotes the two-dimensional Fourier transform.

B. Semiclassical model of atomic dynamics

As in most of the previous theoretical works on
the Sisyphus cooling mechanism, including semiclassical
[12,16,19] as well as quantum treatments [20,21], we con-
sider the simple case of an atom with a ground state
of angular momentum F = 1/2 and an excited state of
angular momentum F ′ = 3/2. Furthermore we restrict
ourselves to a 2D model and to the case of low atomic
saturation, where we can adiabatically eliminate the ex-
cited state of the atom. The time evolution of the atomic
density operator restricted to the ground state manifold
is then governed by the master equation

˙ρ = −

[H, ρ] + Lρ,

i
¯h

with the Hamiltonian

H = ˆp2/2m + ¯h∆′V (ˆx)

and the decay and recycling term

where the sum goes over the polarization and the integral
over the wave vector of the spontaneously emitted photon
projected into 2D. The optical potential depth is ¯h∆′,
the optical pumping rate is γ′, and the atomic transition
operators Bσ(ˆx) and the optical potential operator V (ˆx)
are deﬁned as

Averaging over a set of particles and over time yields
all the required expectation values such as temperatures,
mean local velocities, position distributions or spatial dif-
fusion coeﬃcients. We will discuss the most important
results obtained in that way in Sec. IV.

where Eσ(x) gives the spatial dependence of the σ-
polarized laser light and where we have made use of the
Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients in Eq. (13).

In order to derive a semiclassical theory suitable for
Monte-Carlo simulations we rewrite the master equation
(9) in the Wigner representation deﬁned by

W (x, p, t) =

d2uhx + u/2|ρ(t)|x − u/2ie−ipu.

(2π)2

Z

(12)

(14)

(15)

Note that W (x, p, t) is still an operator in the Hilbert
space of the internal atomic degrees of freedom. However,
for our speciﬁc choice of an atomic F = 1/2 to F ′ = 3/2
transition and the laser polarizations always lying within
the same plane, no coherences between the ground-state
sublevels build up. Hence the Wigner operator W (x, p, t)
remains diagonal,

W (x, p, t) = W+(x, p, t)|m = 1/2ihm = 1/2|

+ W−(x, p, t)|m = −1/2ihm = −1/2|.

(16)

For these diagonal terms we obtain the Fokker-Planck
equations

∓±∂pi ∂pj W∓, (17)

where i, j = x, y and the sum over i, j must be performed.
The full expressions for the jump rates γ±∓ between the
ground-state sublevels, the force coeﬃcients F i
±± and the
diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dij

±± are given in the appendix.

Finally, we use semiclassical Monte-Carlo simulations
[19] to obtain numerical solutions of Eqs. (17), where one
follows the trajectories of many particles with internal
states |+i and |−i. The jump rates between these two
states are given by γ+− and γ−+, respectively. Between
two jumps the particles evolve according to the force F i
++
(resp. F i
−−) acting on them and in addition receive ran-
dom kicks which are chosen in such a way as to simulate
the eﬀect of the diﬀusion terms Dij

++ (resp. Dij

−−).

C. Estimate of ﬁnal temperature

Before turning to the numerical results obtained from
solving the equations of motion presented in the previous
subsection by Monte-Carlo simulations, we will analyti-
cally derive a rough estimate for the steady-state tem-
perature T obtained as the ratio of the mean momentum
diﬀusion coeﬃcient D over the mean friction coeﬃcient
α,

kBT =

D
α

,

(18)

where the bar over D and α denotes averaging over the
internal atomic state and over position. For simplicity
we will restrict the following calculations only to the x
direction.

In order to calculate the friction coeﬃcient α we must
ﬁnd the stationary solution W (x, p) of Eq. (17) up to ﬁrst
order in the atomic velocity v = p/m, i.e., we expand
W (x, p) by

W (x, p) = W 0(x) +

W 1(x) + . . .

(19)

p
m

and insert this into Eq. (17). Since we are considering an
atom moving with constant velocity we may neglect the
force and diﬀusion terms on the right-hand side of the
equation and thus obtain the results

(21)

The friction coeﬃcient, i.e. the term of ﬁrst order in the
velocity v of the force, averaged over the internal atomic
state is then given by

α = F x

(22)

±± as well as W 1

Finally this must be averaged over the position within
the speckle ﬁeld. Since F x
± can be ex-
pressed in terms of the speckle electric ﬁeld amplitude
and its spatial derivatives (see appendix), we need to
know the expectation values of products of these quanti-
ties when averaged over position. Considering the com-
plete randomness of the speckle ﬁeld we assume that all
averages over such products vanish except for

E+E∗

− = 1,

(23)

assuming that the speckle ﬁeld and the counterpropagat-
ing plane wave have the same average intensity, and

(24)

where again dsp is the mean speckle grain size. The
right-hand side of Eq. (24) is obtained under the assump-
tion that the required quantity for the speckle ﬁeld is
the same as for a periodic electric ﬁeld with the same
typical length scale,
i.e. for an electric ﬁeld given by
E(x) = cos[kx(λ/dsp)]. Applying these assumptions to
Eq. (22) yields the friction coeﬃcient

The averaged diﬀusion coeﬃcient has two diﬀerent
components. One of these is obtained by averaging the
diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dxx
±± over the internal atomic states
and over position similarly as done above for the friction
coeﬃcient. The second contribution to the total diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient arises from the change of the dipole force,
if the atom changes its internal state. This dipole dif-
fusion term can be derived easily following the lines of
Ref. [15]. We will omit all the calculational steps here
and only give the ﬁnal result for the total momentum

(27)

We see that the expressions derived in Eqs. (25)-(27) are
essentially the same as the intuitive ones of Sec. II.

It should be emphasized again that all quantities de-
rived in this subsection should be considered as crude es-
timates since they are performed in 1D and rely on some
very rough approximations. However, the qualitative be-
havior of the exact solutions is predicted correctly and
thus these expressions provide a lot of physical insight.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Steady-state temperatures

First,

let us continue the discussion of the numeri-
cally found steady-state temperature depending on vari-
ous system parameters.

In Fig. 4 we plot the steady-state temperature ver-
sus the detuning ∆ for ﬁxed optical potential depth ∆′,
i.e., for varying optical pumping rate γ′. The two lower
curves correspond to the same optical potential depth
but to diﬀerent speckle grain size dsp. In agreement with
Eq. (27) the temperature increases for smaller detunings
∆, i.e. larger pumping rates γ′. For very large detunings,
corresponding to small values of γ′, the temperature as-
sumes a constant value, which is the same for diﬀerent
speckle sizes as long as the optical potential depth ∆′ is
the same. On the other hand for ﬁxed speckle size but
diﬀerent values of ∆′ the temperatures achieved in the
limit of small values of γ′ diﬀer (cf. also Fig. 2).

Fig. 5 shows the steady-state temperature versus the
optical potential depth ∆′ for ﬁxed optical pumping rate
γ′, similar to Fig. 2 but for diﬀerent parameters. Again
we ﬁnd a drastic increase of the temperature towards
small values of ∆′. In this parameter limit the total mo-
mentum diﬀusion (26) reduces to its contribution stem-
ming from the random recoil of the spontaneously emit-
ted photons and hence becomes constant, but simulta-
neously the Sisyphus cooling vanishes, i.e., the friction
force (25) approaches zero. Hence the diﬀusion starts
to predominate the cooling eﬀect and the temperature
increases.

In the opposite limit of large values of ∆′ the total
momentum diﬀusion is dominated by the dipole diﬀusion
term of Eq. (26) and hence the temperature increases
linearly with ∆′. Note on Fig. 5 that the steady-state
temperature ﬁnally becomes independent of the optical
pumping rate γ′ and of the speckle size dsp in this limit,
in agreement with Eq. (27).

B. Local properties

In this subsection we will discuss some of the localiza-
tion properties of the cold atoms. To this end we give
a contour plot of the steady-state atomic density ρ in
Fig. 6(a), where the calculations have been performed
for the speckle ﬁeld depicted in Fig. 1. Comparing these
two ﬁgures one can see easily that the atomic density
is strongly correlated with the speckle ﬁeld intensity I.
This statistical dependence can be demonstrated more
clearly by calculating the covariance, deﬁned as

cov(ρ, I) = hρIi/

hρ2ihI 2i.

(28)

p

We ﬁnd that this quantity assumes values close to its
maximum value of one, e.g. for Fig. 6(a) cov(ρ, I) = 0.92.
This means that the intensity distribution of the speckle
ﬁeld is eﬃciently mapped onto the atomic density distri-
bution.

However, if one looks closer at Figs. 1, 6(a), one notes
some discrepancies, for instance some of the relatively
shallow optical potential wells at the top of the ﬁgures are
surprisingly strongly populated. Although these features

5

cannot be explained quantitatively, we will describe some
of the physical mechanisms in the following.

Basically these local diﬀerences are caused by the fact
that the ﬁeld amplitude and the phase of the speckle
ﬁeld are essentially uncorrelated. Whereas in usual op-
tical lattices the light amplitude and phase are always
correlated, which e.g. in a 3D lin⊥lin setup yields that
the optical potential minima coincide with places of pure
circular polarization [8], this is not the case in our setup.
Consequently the local polarization of the total light ﬁeld
at places of maximum local speckle ﬁeld intensity can be
linear as well as circular, but in general will be an ar-
bitrary elliptical polarization. Hence only speckle grains
(regions of high speckle ﬁeld intensity) of mainly circular
polarization contribute to the Sisyphus-type cooling, but
speckle grains of dominating linear polarization do not.
It should be emphasized that in speckle grains of
mainly circular polarization local cooling can be found,
that is, even within a single well an atom can be cooled
by optical pumping processes between the widely diﬀer-
ing optical potentials of the two ground-state sublevels.
This is in contrast to the plane-waves 1D lin⊥lin conﬁg-
uration, where an atom must travel across several poten-
tial wells in order to get cooled (nonlocal cooling). Thus,
the atom is more likely to be cooled and trapped within
circularly polarized speckle grains.

Another reason for the diﬀerent steady-state atomic
densities in potential wells of the same depths is formed
by the radiation pressure force. As already mentioned
above, the light ﬁeld amplitude and phase of the speckle
ﬁeld are mutually independent and thus also the phase
gradient can diﬀer strongly at the bottom of the poten-
tial wells. Hence, within some potential wells the atom
experiences a relatively strong radiation pressure force
and is thus pushed away. As an example, Fig. 6(b)
shows again a contour plot of the speckle ﬁeld intensity
(same as Fig. 1), together with the vector ﬁeld of the
local radiation pressure force. This shows, e.g., a sig-
niﬁcant radiation pressure in the x direction in the high
intensity speckle grains at the center of the ﬁgure. Cor-
respondingly, we have numerically found nonvanishing
mean atomic velocities in these regions, which means that
there exists a stationary ﬂow of atoms following roughly
the direction of the local radiation pressure force. This
might suggest that a description of speckled lattices in
terms of ﬂuid mechanics formalism may be interesting to
investigate, but, however, this is out of the scope of this
paper.

Finally we will brieﬂy discuss the atomic density dis-
tribution P (ρ), i.e., the probability of ﬁnding a certain
density. A histogram plot for the speckle ﬁeld intensity
P (I) and the atomic density is given in Fig. 7.

The numerically obtained speckle ﬁeld intensity dis-
tribution, Fig. 7(a), follows an exponential law, as theo-
retically discussed in [2], with equal mean and standard
deviation, i.e.,

P (I/hIi) = exp(−I/hIi).

(29)

As can be seen from Fig. 7(b) the atomic density does not
follow the same law, since there is always a background
of unbound atoms and hence the probability of ﬁnding
a density below a certain threshold vanishes. But above
this threshold the density distribution function closely
resembles the speckle intensity distribution, which again
indicates a strong correlation between the light ﬁeld in-
tensity and the atomic density.

C. Spatial diﬀusion

Another important quantity for characterizing the
properties of the cooled and trapped atoms is the spatial
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which roughly quantiﬁes the trans-
fer of atoms between several potential wells and hence of
the spreading of an initially small atomic cloud.

Experimentally, as well as in our Monte-Carlo simula-
tions, the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient Ds is obtained from
the spreading of an initial atomic cloud whose variance
follows a linear law in the long-time limit,

[∆r(t)]2 = [∆r(0)]2 + 2Dst.

An estimate for the value of Ds can be derived by using

(30)

(31)

Ds =

D
α2

for the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient for a Brownian mo-
tion which in certain limits is a good approximation for
Sisyphus cooling [17]. Applying our ﬁndings for the fric-
tion coeﬃcient (25) and the momentum diﬀusion (26) we
obtain

We can now compare this with the spatial diﬀusion
coeﬃcients obtained by semiclassical Monte-Carlo simu-
lations as depicted in Fig. 8 as a function of the detuning
∆. It follows from Eq. (32) that for γ′/∆′ = Γ/∆ ≪ 1
the ﬁrst term will dominate and hence the spatial diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient scales linearly with γ′, i.e. like 1/∆ if ∆′
is kept constant. This is in qualitative agreement with
the curves of Fig. 8 for not too large values of the detun-
ing ∆. However, Eq. (32) only holds if the atom moves
only a fraction of the speckle size d between two optical
pumping processes [17], which explains the deviation of
the numerically obtained curves from the 1/∆ law for
large values of ∆.

Note that for ∆ ≫ Γ and within its range of validity
Eq. (32) predicts an increase of the spatial diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient with the square of the speckle grain size. This
has been nicely conﬁrmed by our numerical simulations.

6

For an actual experiment, where the speckle size is typi-
cally of the order of tens of wavelengths, this means that
the spatial diﬀusion of the atoms in the speckle ﬁeld can
easily be orders of magnitude larger than for a standard
optical lattice, even if the steady-state temperatures (27)
are comparable.

V. INFLUENCE OF THE LONGITUDINAL
DIRECTION

Compared to the transverse directions, which have
been discussed so far, the physical properties of the sys-
tem along the laser propagation direction are completely
diﬀerent. First, it should be emphasized again that the
size of the speckle grains in this direction is generally
much larger, i.e., by a factor on the order of dsp/λ. But
superimposed on this relatively large length scale there is
a standard 1D lin⊥lin conﬁguration with a typical length
scale of half an optical wavelength, such that the system
must be characterized in this direction by two widely dif-
ferent length scales. Second, this superimposed lin⊥lin
conﬁguration leads to eﬃcient cooling in the longitudi-
nal direction at regions in space where the speckle ﬁeld
intensity approximately equals the intensity of the coun-
terpropagating plane wave. However, at locations where
the two beam intensities diﬀer it also leads to a non-
balanced radiation pressure force driving the atoms away
from these locations. Note that the situation is similar
to what can be found in quasi-periodic lattices [11].

Hence, the full 3D situation is much more intricate
than the transverse 2D scheme. Also numerically a com-
plete 3D treatment would be very demanding. Instead we
performed some 2D simulations of the cooling dynamics
including the longitudinal and one transverse direction,
which should give some relevant information about the
actual behavior of the system in 3D.

In Fig. 9 we depict the temperatures in the longitu-
dinal direction and in the transverse direction obtained
from such 2D Monte-Carlo simulations. We see that the
transverse temperatures are always higher than the lon-
gitudinal ones. Even if there exists a strong radiation
pressure in the longitudinal direction in regions of diﬀer-
ing speckle and plane wave intensity, this eﬀect is over-
compensated by the much more eﬃcient Sisyphus cooling
in this direction.

Secondly, let us remark that the transverse temper-
atures are larger for this type of Monte-Carlo simula-
tions than those obtained from simulations including two
transverse directions. Hence the inclusion of the longitu-
dinal direction tends to reduce the eﬃciency of the trans-
verse cooling. This can be understood by the following
arguments. Since the transverse cooling relies on a Sisy-
phus eﬀect, it is more eﬃcient for deeper potential wells
because in this case a single quantum jump between the
two adiabatic potentials reduces the atomic energy by a
larger amount. Thus the cooling mechanism is most eﬀec-
tive in regions of maximum speckle ﬁeld intensity. But

in the longitudinal direction, these regions correspond
exactly to the regions of maximum radiation pressure,
and hence the atom is eﬃciently pushed away. For the
transverse cooling this means that the atom avoids the
deepest potential wells, which consequently reduces the
cooling eﬃciency and therefore increases the steady-state
temperature.

For the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient we found a much
larger diﬀerence between the longitudinal and the trans-
verse direction than for the temperature. This agrees
well with our previous results that the leading term in
the expression of the temperature (27) is independent of
the speckle size whereas the spatial diﬀusion (32) scales
with the square of the speckle size. Hence the diﬀerence
in the typical length scale between the longitudinal direc-
tion (λ) and the transverse direction (dsp) yields widely
diﬀerent spatial diﬀusion. Again we note that the val-
ues for the transverse spatial diﬀusion obtained by the
Monte-Carlo simulations with the longitudinal and one
transverse direction lies above the value obtained from
simulations restricted to the transverse plane, according
to the reduced cooling eﬃciency as discussed above.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have demonstrated that 3D laser cool-
ing of neutral atoms can be achieved by a 1D setup, if
one of the two counterpropagating laser beams of a plane-
waves 1D optical molasses [14] is replaced by a speckle
laser ﬁeld. The cooling mechanism in this case relies on
a Sisyphus eﬀect similar to the one known in usual (pe-
riodic) lattices [12] in one, two, and three dimensions.
We have calculated steady-state temperatures similar to
those obtained for periodic lattices for large red detun-
ings of the lasers from the atomic resonance. In this far-
detuned limit the steady-state temperatures also become
independent of the mean speckle grain size.

In contrast to usual lattices we have found various local
eﬀects, such as local cooling and nonvanishing radiation
pressure forces which are essentially decoupled from the
local optical potential depth. Furthermore, according to
the speckle ﬁeld the spatial diﬀusion of the atoms is in-
creased by a factor of approximately the square of the
typical speckle grain size.

Thus for an experimental realization of this scheme
two points should be emphasized. First, the experimen-
tal setup is relatively simple since a 1D conﬁguration is
already suﬃcient to yield 3D sub-Doppler cooling. On
the other hand, the obtained speckle grain size is typi-
cally much larger than an optical wavelength which gives
rise to longer cooling times and a huge increase of the spa-
tial diﬀusion. Thus, the lifetime of the trapped atomic
cloud will be much shorter than in usual lattices and the
achievable atomic densities much lower. However, ﬁrst
experimental results [22] have already conﬁrmed most of
the theoretical predictions presented in this work and rea-

For the derivation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients we have
simpliﬁed the spontaneous emission pattern by assuming
that ﬂuorescence photons are only emitted along the x,
y, and z axes [19].

±± and Dij

Two other points are worth a comment here concern-
ing the application of these diﬀusion constants and forces
in the semiclassical Monte-Carlo simulations outlined in
Sec. III B. First, it turns out that for all realistic choices
∓± and Dij
of the system parameters the cross terms F i
∓±
between the two ground-state sublevels can be neglected
as compared with the terms F i
±±. Second,
at some positions in space the diﬀusion coeﬃcients as-
sume negative values. This property indicates a purely
quantum feature of the system, i.e., it shows that there
exist positions in space where the atomic wavefunction
collapses rather than spreads out [23]. However, this fea-
ture cannot be mimicked by the semiclassical simulations,
where negative diﬀusion makes no sense. Hence, when-
ever this situation occurs in our numerical simulations
we set the diﬀusion coeﬃcients equal to zero to avoid
this problem.

sonable agreement with the numerically obtained values
for, e.g., the steady-state temperatures has been found.
Although such investigations and possible extensions of
the scheme, e.g., to the study of speckled dark lattices,
already present interesting results for laser cooling, we
think that a main interest lies in the possibility of creat-
ing a disordered sample of cold atoms with well controlled
statistical characteristics. Because of the growing inter-
est in the study of disordered materials, the presented
system may thus be useful in this domain.

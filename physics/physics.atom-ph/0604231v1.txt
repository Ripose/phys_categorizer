We analyze low-energy scattering of positrons on Ar atoms and N2 molecules using Modiﬁed
Eﬀective-Range Theory (MERT) developped by O’Malley, Spruch and Rosenberg [Journal of Math.
Phys. 2, 491 (1961)]. We use formulation of MERT based on exact solutions of Schr¨odinger equation
with polarization potential rather than low-energy expansions of phase shifts into momentum series.
We show that MERT describes well experimental data, provided that eﬀective-range expansion is
performed both for s- and p-wave scattering, which dominate in the considered regime of positron
energies (0.4 - 2 eV). We estimate the values of the s-wave scattering lenght and the eﬀective range
for e+-Ar and e+-N2 collisions.

Electron (and positron) scattering on atoms at very
low energies is dominated by polarization forces. Mod-
iﬁed eﬀective range theory (MERT) was developed by
O’Malley, Rosenberg and Spruch [1, 2] for low-energy
scattering of charged particles on neutral polarizable sys-
tems in general. O’Malley [3] applied MERT for elec-
tron scattering on noble gases, in particular in the re-
gion of Ramsauer- Townsend minimum, using early total
[4] and momentum transfer [5] experimental cross sec-
tions. Haddad and O’Malley [6] used three parameter
MERT ﬁt for s-wave phase-shift in electron-argon scat-
tering and Ferch, Granitza and Raith [7] - for Ramsauer
minimum in methane. Higher-order terms in MERT,
resulting from short-range components of polarizabitity,
were introduced by Ali and Fraser [8]. MERT analy-
sis for Ne, Ar, Kr up to 1 eV was carefully revisited by
Buckman and Mitroy [9] who used ﬁve-parameter ﬁt for
s-wave and p-wave shifts.

Applicability of MERT to low-energy positron scatter-
ing was already hypothesized in [2]. However, ﬁrst mea-
surements of total cross sections for positron scattering
at low energies on noble atoms come only from seventies
[10, 11].

The most systematic data for noble atoms, extend-
ing down to 0.3 eV were done in WSU Detroit lab, us-
ing positrons from a short-lived C11 radionuclid, with
about 0.1 eV energy resolution [11]. Those data indi-
cated clearly a rise of the cross section in the zero en-
ergy limit in gases, like He, Ar, H2, Kr, Xe, CO2, see
[11]. Unfortunately, subsequent experiments [12, 13] used
Ne22 source and thick W-vanes positron moderator, thus
worsening energy resolution and not allowing to make re-
liable measurements below 1 eV. To gain in signal, large
apertures and strong guiding magnetic ﬁelds were used,
leading to underestimation of cross sections - some data
showed even a fall in the limit of zero energy for highly
polarizable targets, like C6H6 [14].

Only two of the most recent set-ups reached energies
below 1 eV with good signal-to-noise ratio. In San Diego

annihilation rates in Ar and Xe were measured, showing
a steep rise below 1 eV [15]. In Trento total cross sections
in Ar and N2 were measured [16] with angular resolution
better by a factor of 30 than in some previous experi-
ments [12]. Both laboratories conﬁrm the early observa-
tions from WSU Detroit on the rise of positron cross sec-
tions in the zero-energy limit. Such a rise is also predicted
by ab-initio theories [17], see [16] for detailed compari-
son. A phenomenological attempt to apply MERT-like ﬁt
for low-energy cross sections in benzene and cyclohexane
was done by Karwasz, Pliszka and Zecca [18].

In the present paper we apply MERT to positron total
cross sections on argon and nitrogen, using recent ex-
perimental data from Trento [16]. We use MERT model
based on direct solution of Schr¨odinger equation with po-
larization potential as originally proposed by O’Malley,
Spruch and Rosenberg [1]. Diﬀerently from earlier works,
for the p-wave phaseshift we consider not only the po-
larization potential but contribution from a general-type
short range interaction. This allows us to extend the
MERT applicability for positrons to energies above 1 eV.
A clear indication on importance of p-wave scattering in
this energy range comes from recent diﬀerential cross sec-
tions measurements in argon [19]. The present model in-
troduces a second MERT parameter for the p-wave shift
thus developing an approximation with two parameters
for both s and p-wave phaseshifts. The ﬁrst parameter is
to be interpreted as a scattering length and the second as
an eﬀective range. We compare our MERT model with
the expansion into momentum series valid at low energies
and with ab-initio theories [17, 20].

Let us brieﬂy review the eﬀective-range expansion for
1/r4 interaction. We divide the interaction potential be-
tween charged particle and neutral atom into the long-
αe2/(2r4) with α denoting the
range part: Vp(r) =
atomic polarizability and e the charge, and the short-
range part: Vs(r) describing forces acting at distances
comparable to the size of atoms. In the relative coordi-

Let us turn now to positron scattering. We compare
the total cross-section measured in experiment for Ar and
N2 [16] with predictions of the theoretical model based
on the eﬀective-range expansion. In our approach the ef-
fects of the short-range potential are included both for s-
and p-wave giving the leading contribution to the scatter-
ing in the considered regime of energies. Thus, our model
contains four unknown parameters: the scattering length
a and the eﬀective range R0 for s-wave, and the zero-
energy contribution b = B(0) and the eﬀective range R1
for p-wave. For the investigated regime of positrons ener-
gies, q = kR∗ can take values larger than unity, therefore
for s- and p-wave we do not use expansions (5)-(6) valid
for q . 1, but we rather applied the initial formula (4)
for the phase shift, performing only ﬁnite-range expan-
sion for the parameter B. In this case, values of ν and
m has to be evaluated numerically, using the approach
described in the Appendix.

For the calculations we use recent experimental values
3
3 and α = 11.54a0
of the polarizability: α = 11.23a0
(atomic units), for Ar and N2, respectively [25]. Table I
contains values of the characteristic distance R∗ and the
characteristic energy E∗ = ~2/(2µR∗2) for the polariza-
tion potential, and the values of four parameters: a, b,
R0, R1 which were determined by ﬁtting our model to
the experimental data.

In the case of N2 the size of the molecule scaled by
R∗ is much larger than for Ar, therefore we restricted
our eﬀective-range analysis to lower energies, ﬁtting the
model to experimental data with E . 0.8E∗.
In this
regime the contribution of the eﬀective-range correction
in p-wave is rather small, and one does not get reliable re-
sults for this parameter from the ﬁtting procedure. Thus,
for N2 we considered only three parameters a, b and R0
accounting for eﬀects of the short-range part of the po-
tential.

Fig. 1 shows the experimental data for the total scat-
tering cross-section for Ar as a function of positron col-
lision energy. They are compared with: the MERT the-
oretical curve which best ﬁts the experimental data, its
low-energy expansion given by Eqs. (5)-(7), and the re-
sults of McEachran et al.
[17]. The total cross-section
is presented in units of R∗, while the energy is scaled by
E∗. In the inset we additionally present contributions of
the s and p waves to the total scattering cross-section.
Similar results but for the scattering of positrons on N2
are illustrated in Fig. 2.

We note the good agreement between our model and
the results of McEachran et al.
[17] at low energies.

A somewhat worse agreement in N2 can partially result
from poorer statistics of experimental data. Also ab-
initio theoretical calculation in N2 show a big spread in
determination of as, see for instance [26]. Both for Ar
and N2 the model shows importance of p-wave scatter-
ing above 0.7-0.8 eV. The s-wave eﬀective range for Ar
amounts to 1.06a0 while in N2 to 2.78a0 . We recall the
”size” of the N2 molecule by the experimental determina-
tion of the maximum HOMO density along the molecule
axis which is about 2.3a0 [27]. Finally from Figs. 1 and 2
we observe that expansion into momentum series (5)-(7)
works only at very low energies below 0.1eV.

In conclusion, we performed MERT analysis using an-
alytical solution of Schr¨odinger equation for polarization
potential and we apply it to positron Ar (and N2) scat-
tering up to 2eV. The scattering length in Ar agrees well
with other predictions and the eﬀective range (for s-wave)
is 1.06a0. More experiments are needed at low energies
to validate better the eﬀective range parameters.

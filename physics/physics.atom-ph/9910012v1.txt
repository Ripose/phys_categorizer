Abstract

Low-energy muon-transfer cross sections and rates in collisions of muonic

atoms with hydrogen isotopes are calculated using a six-state close-coupling

approximation to coordinate-space Faddeev-Hahn-type equations.

In the

muonic case satisfactory results are obtained for all hydrogen isotopes and

the experimentaly observed strong isotopic dependence of transfer rates is

also reproduced. A comparison with results of other theoretical and available

experimental works is presented. The present model also leads to good trans-

fer cross sections in the well-understood problem of antihydrogen formation

in antiproton-positronium collision.

I. INTRODUCTION

Charge-transfer reactions involving few particles in atomic physics are very challenging

and interesting from both theoretical and experimental points of view and we study here the

problem of charge transfer in some atomic reactions involving exotic particles. Speciﬁcally,

we study muon transfer in D−Hµ, T−Hµ, and T−Dµ systems where the suﬃx µ denotes

a muonic atom with the electron replaced by a muon (µ−). We also study the problem of

antihydrohen ( ¯H) formation in antiproton-positronium collision with the positronium (Ps)

in an initial 1s state.

On the theoretical side, in these transfer reactions one needs to consider rearrangement

of a charged particle. Because of the Coulomb interaction one needs a careful treatment

of the dynamics for a correct description. If one can identify the basic dynamical ingredi-

ents necessary for a satisfactory description of these processes involving a small number of

particles, such a study will help us to formulate models in more complex situations. On

the experimental side, the present study involving muon and positron transfer is of current

interest in the muon-catalyzed fusion cycle [1–6] and in the formation and study of the

antihydrogen atom [7,8].

Although there are some experimental measurements and several theoretical investiga-

tions on these processes, there still remain discrepancies among various studies. Here we use

a diﬀerent theoretical approach based on a detailed few-body dynamical consideration for a

careful reinvestigation of these three-body charge-transfer reactions. Traditionaly, such prob-

lems are investigated by a tractable approximation scheme in the Schr¨odinger framework,

without explicitly considering a few-body dynamical equation. In addition to variational

calculations, these schemes include close-coupling, hyperspherical, and adiabatic approxi-

mations. Here we would like to point out that the processes of muonic transfer reactions

and antihydrogen formation are three-body Coulombic rearrangement collisions. Conse-

quently, it seems reasonable that in addition to approximations based on the Schr¨odinger

equation, a detailed few-body consideration is useful. In what follows we develop a method,

2

which is based on detailed few-body equations rather than the eﬀective potential treatment

employed in alternative investigations.

For the three-charged particle system, say TDµ, only two asymptotic conﬁgurations are

possible, i.e. (Dµ) T and (Tµ) D. This suggests to write down a set of two coupled equations

for components Ψ1 and Ψ2 of the wave function Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2 [9,10] with each component

carrying the asymptotic boundary condition for a speciﬁc conﬁguration. One such equation

with two components for the three-particle system was ﬁrst written by Hahn [9] following

the most general decomposition of the three-body wave function into three components

suggested by Faddeev [11] and is usually referred to as the Faddeev-Hahn equation [12]. We

solve the integro-diﬀerential form of this equation by a six-state close-coupling approximation

scheme which consists in expanding the wave function components Ψ1 and Ψ2 in terms of

eigenfunctions of subsystem Hamiltonians in initial and ﬁnal channels, respectively. The

resultant coupled equation is then projected on the expansion functions. After a partial-

wave projection this leads to a set of one-dimensional coupled equations for the expansion

coeﬃcients, which is solved numerically.

Recently, there have been considerable theoretical and experimental interests in the study

of the muon-transfer reactions between hydrogen isotopes in the muon catalyzed fusion cycle

The measurements for the transfer rates

with σtr being the transfer cross section, v the relative velocity of the incident particles and
N0 = 4.25 × 1022cm−3 the liquid hydrogen density, are listed in Table I together with recent

theoretical calculations. One can see diﬀerences between diﬀerent experimental data [13–19]

and theoretical results [20–25].

One of the most attractive reactions for ¯H formation is the three-body positron-transfer

process

¯p + Ps → ¯H + e−.

(3)

Although no experimental cross sections are available, this process is being used at CERN

for the production and study of antihydrogen. A number of calculations have recently been

carried out to calculate the cross section of reaction (3) as a function of the incident Ps

energy. The calculations were performed by diﬀerent methods, for instance, with hyper-

spherical coupled-channel expansions [26] and close coupling approximations (CCA) [27].

As an additional test of the present method, calculations for the S−wave antihydrogen

formation (3) at low energies are also performed.

In Sec. II we develop the formalism. The results obtained for reactions (1) and (3) are

given in Sec. III. Finally, we present some concluding remarks in Sec. IV.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

Let us take the system of units to be e = ¯h = mµ = 1 and denote, say T by 1, D by 2

and muon by 3. Below the three-body breakup threshold, following two-cluster asymptotic

conﬁgurations are possible in the system (123): (23) − 1 and (13) − 2. These conﬁgurations,

denoted simply by 1 and 2, respectively, are determined by the Jacobi coordinates (~rj3, ~ρk)

~rj3 = ~r3 − ~rj,

~ρk = (~r3 + mj~rj)/(1 + mj) − ~rk,

j 6= k = 1, 2,

(4)

~rj, mj are coordinates and masses of the particles j = 1, 2, 3, respectively.

Let us introduce the total three-body wave function as a sum of two components

Ψ(~r1, ~r2, ~r3) = Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) + Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2),

(5)

where Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) is quadratically integrable over the variable ~r23, and Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) over the

variable ~r13. To deﬁne Ψl (l = 1, 2) a set of two coupled equations can be written down

4

(E − H0 − V23)Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) = (V23 + V12)Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2)

(E − H0 − V13)Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) = (V13 + V12)Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) ,

(6)

(7)

(8)

where E is the center-of-mass energy, H0 is the total kinetic energy operator, and Vij(rij)

are pair-interaction potentials (i 6= j = 1, 2, 3). Equations (6) satisfy the Schr¨odinger

equation exactly and for energies below the three-body breakup threshold they possess the

same advantages as the Faddeev equations, since they are formulated for the wave function

components with correct physical asymptotes.

In the general case a component of the three-body wave function has the asymptotic form

which includes all open channels: elastic/inelastic, transfer and breakup. In this case each

component of the total wave function carries a speciﬁc asymtotic behavior. The component

Ψ1 carries the asymptotic behavior in elastic and inelastic channels:

n is the binding

energy of (j3), i 6= j = 1, 2, Ael/in(Ωρ1) and Atr(Ωρ2) are the scattering amplitudes in the

q

elastic/inelastic and transfer channels. This approach simpliﬁes the solution procedure and

simultaneously provide a correct asymptotic behaviour of the solution below the 3-body

breakup threshold.

For solving Eq. (9) we expand the wave function components in terms of bound states in

initial and ﬁnal channels, and project this equation on these bound states. This prescription

is similar to that adopted in the close-coupling approximation. Speciﬁcally, we use the

following partial-wave expansion

where C’s are the Clebsch-Gordon coeﬃcients, and Y ’s are the usual spherical harmonics,

and L, λ, l and M, m′, m are the appropriate angular momenta variables and their projec-

tions. Next we make the following close-coupling-type approximation for the radial part in

terms of the bound-state wave functions in the initial and ﬁnal channels:

Then we substitute Eqs.

the appropriate biharmonic functions and the corresponding radial functions R(k)

nl (rj3), and

integrate over the corresponding angular coordinates of the vectors ~rj3 and ~ρk. Then we

obtain a set of integral diﬀerential equations for the unknown functions f (k)

For brevity we have deﬁned α ≡ nlλ and α′ ≡ n′l′λ′, and omit the conserved total angular

momentum label LM. The functions f (k)

α (ρk) depend on the scalar argument, but Eq. (14)

is not yet one-dimensional. We are using the Jacobi coordinates

This shows that modulus of ~ρj depend on two vectors: ~ρj = γ~rj3 − βk~ρk. The integration in

the right-hand side of Eq. (14) is done over these two vectors.

To obtain one-dimensional integral diﬀerential equations, corresponding to Eq. (14), we

proceed with the integration over variables {~ρj, ~ρk}, rather than {~rj3, ~ρk}. The Jacobian of

this transformation is γ−3. Thus, we come to a set of one-dimensional integral diﬀerential

To ﬁnd unique solution to system (20), appropriate boundary conditions are to be con-

σel = σ11 ∼ const. For comparison with experimental low-energy data it is very useful to
calculate the transfer rates (2) because λtr(k(1)

1 → 0) ∼ const.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To solve the integro-diﬀerential equation, one has to calculate the angle integrals in Eq.

(20) which are independent of the energy E. One needs to calculate them only once and

store on hard disk for the calculation of other observables, for instance, the cross sections

at diﬀerent energies. Subintegrals in Eq. (20) have strong dependence on ρi and ρi′ (i 6=
i′ = 1, 2). To calculate S(ii′)

αα′ (ρi, ρi′) at diﬀerent coordinates an adaptable algorithm has been

used. In this case using the relation

Note that the expression (28) diﬀers from zero only in a narrow strip when ρi ≈ ρi′.

We employ muonic atomic unit: distances are measured in units of aµ, where aµ is

the radius of muonic hydrogen atom. The integro-diﬀerential equations were solved by

usual numerical procedure by discretizing them into a linear system of equations, which are

subsequently solved by Gauss elimination method. In solving these equations distances upto

9

50aµ were considered and 400 − 600 points were used in the discretization. The following

mass values are used in the unit of electron mass: mH = 1836.152, mD = 3670.481, mT =

5496.918 and the muon mass is mµ = 206.769.

Tables II, III, and IV include our results for the muonic transfer cross sections and rates

for all hydrogen isotopes (1) using diﬀerent approximation schemes. We present results for

two-, four-, and six-state approximation where we include 1s, 1s+2s and 1s+2s+2p states

of the muonic atoms in the initial and ﬁnal channels, respectively. In solving the equations

we employed only the lowest partial wave, e.g., L = 0. As we shall mainly be concerned

with the experimental muon transfer rates at very low energies, the higher partial waves are

expected to have negligible contribution. The 2p states are found to contribute signiﬁcantly

in T-Dµ, moderately in D-Hµ, and little in T-Hµ systems. This is in agreement with similar

conclusion of Ref. [24] in the T-Dµ system. This could be understood qualitatively from the

following consideration. At zero incident energy the relative velocity in the ﬁnal state after

muon transfer is the highest in the case of T-Hµ, lowest in the case of T-Dµ and intermediate

in the case of D-Hµ. It is expected that the polarization potential arising out of a 1s+2s+2p

calculation will have the largest eﬀect on convergence when the ﬁnal-state velocity is the

lowest. Hence the necessity of the higher-order states is more pronounced in the case of

T-Dµ and less pronounced in the case of T-Hµ. We also ﬁnd that as energy decreases the

transfer cross sections increase and the transfer rates attain a constant value. These transfer

rates are essentially constant below 0.1 eV and are also measured experimentally, so that

we can compare our rates with other experimental and theoretical results.

For the D-Hµ system the present low-energy muon transfer rate of 133×108 s−1 is in

agreement with both experiments [13,14]. The present rate is slightly smaller than the

theoretical studies of Refs. [20], [21] and this makes the agreement with experiment better.

For the T-Hµ system again the present result 61×108 s−1 is in better agreement with the

experiment [16] than the other theoretical studies.

In case of T-Dµ, the present result

2.3×108 s−1 is also in very good agreement with experiment.

Within the six-state approximation our cross sections for low energy elastic scattering

10

in case T-Dµ system are presented in Table V together with other theoretical results. The

present cross sections attain a constant value at low energies and is in fairly good agreement

with results of other studies.

As a futher test of the present few-body approach, we have also calculated S-wave cross

sections of antihydrogen formation in antiproton-positronium low energy collisions (3). In

Table VI our results within the six state approximation (Ps[1s+2s+2p], ¯H[1s+2s+2p]) are

compared with calculations based on hyperspherical coupled-channel method [26]. Consid-

ering that the present calculation is limited to only the lowest partial wave (L = 0) and

to a truncated basis set (1s+2s+2p), the agreement is reasonable for energies below 1 eV.

However, at 2 eV the agreement is not so good. The reason for this is not clear at present.

Further theoretical investigation including higher partial waves with an extended basis set

could reveal the trend of the converged cross sections.

IV. CONCLUSION

The study of three-body Coulombic systems have been the subject of this work. We have

formulated a method for a few-body description of the rearrangement scattering problem by

solving the Faddeev-Hahn-type equations in coordinate space. It is shown that within this

formalism, the application of a close-coupling-type ansatz leads to satisfactory results al-

ready in low-order approximations for (i) muon-transfer reactions between hydrogen isotopes

and (ii) antihydrogen formation in antiproton-positronium collision. Because of computa-

tion diﬃculties, in this preliminary application we have considered up to six states in the

expansion scheme (1s+2s+2p on each center), which may not always be adequate. Further

calculations with larger basis sets are needed to obtain the converged results.

The present model leads to a reduction of the usual technical eﬀort and is deﬁnitely

worth using for investigations of larger systems. It seems reasonable to suppose that the

method should be an eﬀective tool for the description of other muonic and atomic few-

body collisions. For instance, one could study using the present approach the following

11

muon-transfer reactions to elements with Z ≥ 2

(Hµ)1s + XZ → XZ

µ + H,

(29)

where the cross section depends in a complicated manner on the charge Z [5].

Theoretically, the reaction (29) is of much interest as an example of low-energy rear-

rangement scattering in a system of three charged particles with Coulomb repulsion in the

ﬁnal state. Evidently it makes additional diﬃculties for correct theoretical description of

Eq. (29) [12]. The Faddeev-Hahn-type approach seems to be suitable for the study of such

reactions and would be a topic of future investigation. We are presently in the process of

studying reaction (29) with the present method for Z = 2 and 3. We also plan to employ

an extended basis set with more basis functions in the future. Also, the excited state muon-

transfer reactions of recent experimantal and theoretical interest [29,30] could be studied

with the present model.

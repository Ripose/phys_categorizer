We study the recent introduced dressed coordinates in the path-integral approach. We deﬁne these coordi-
nates in the context of a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to massless scalar ﬁeld and, we show that in this
model the dressed coordinates appear as a coordinate transformation preserving the path-integral functional
measure. We also generalize the sum rules established in a previous work.

Introduction

Since a long time the experimental and theoretical investigations on the polarization of atoms by optical pumping
and the possibility of detecting changes in their polarization states has allowed the observation of resonant eﬀects
associated to the coupling of these atoms with strong radiofrequency ﬁelds [1]. However, as established in [2],
the theoretical study of these eﬀects using perturbative methods requires the calculation of very high-order terms
in perturbation theory, what makes the standard Feynman diagrams technique practically unreliable in those
cases. The experience of treating non-perturbatively such kind of systems consisting of an atom coupled to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld it has lead to the idea of “dressed atom” introduced in [3] and [4], where the dressed states are
deﬁned as the collective eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. Through the years this concept has been extensively
used to investigate several situations involving the interaction of atoms and electromagnetic ﬁelds [5] and it was
shown that the dressed atom approach provides a convenient non-perturbative theoretical framework to perform
this analysis.

On the other hand, recently a new type of dressed states has been proposed by introducing dressed coordinates
[6, 7, 8] which are analogous to the renormalized ﬁelds in quantum ﬁeld theory. Such new dressed states are deﬁned
in terms of these dressed coordinates which were deﬁned in the context of a harmonic oscillator interacting linearly
with a massless scalar ﬁeld. These coordinates allowed the construction of dressed states, with the physically
correct property of stability of the oscillator ground state in the absence of ﬁeld quanta (the quantum vacuum).
Technically, the dressed coordinate approach has the advantage of allowing an exact nonperturbative treatment for
the oscillator radiation processes.

It is worthwhile to observe that despite the linearity of the afore mentioned system, if we work in terms of
the coordinates that appear in the Hamiltonian it is not possible an analytical computation of the probabilities
associated to the oscillator radiation processes. For example, the exact calculation of the simplest process, i.e., the
probability of spontaneous decay from the ﬁrst excited level to the ground state, is not possible. However in the
framework of dressed coordinates, it has been possible to solve this problem exactly and for small coupling constant,
it agrees with the long time know result: e−Γt [6]. Furthermore, when applied to a conﬁned atom (approximated
by the oscillator) in a spherical cavity of suﬃciently small radius [7], the method accounted for, the experimentally
observed, inhibition of the spontaneous decaying processes [9, 10] and using the dressed coordinates it was possible
to construct sum rules [11] for the physical process. Also, the study of an atom in the dipole approximation coupled
to the electromagnetic ﬁeld modes has been treated in [12]. On the other hand, the possibility of studying nonlinear
interaction between the oscillator and the ﬁeld modes was treated in Refs. [13, 14].

Nevertheless, in all previous works [6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14] the dressed coordinates were implemented via the
operatorial formalism of Quantum Mechanics. The aim of this paper is to introduce them via the path-integral
approach. As in previous works, because its exact integrability, we introduce the dressed coordinates in the context
of a harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to a massless scalar ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we introduce the model and compute the propagator by exact
diagonalization. The section 3 is devoted to establish the dressed coordinates. In Sec. 4 we compute the proba-
bilities associated to some physical process and extend the sum rules found in [11]. Finally in Sec. 5 we gives our
remarks and conclusions. Through this paper we use natural units c = ~ = 1.

2 The model

We consider as a toy model of an atom-electromagnetic ﬁeld system the system composed by a harmonic oscillator
(the atom) coupled to a massless scalar ﬁeld. By considering the dipole approximation and expanding in the ﬁeld
modes we get the following Hamiltonian [6]

where q0 is the oscillator coordinate and qk are the ﬁeld modes with k = 1, 2, ...; ωk = 2π/L, ck = ηωk, η = √2g∆ω,
ωk = 2π/L . With g being a frequency dimensional coupling constant and L the diameter of the
∆ω = ωk+1 −
sphere in which we conﬁne the oscillator-ﬁeld system. In Eq. (1) the limit N
is to be understood. The last
term in Eq. (1) guarantees a positive-deﬁned Hamiltonian and it can be seen as a frequency renormalization [6].

Due to the Hamiltonian (1) is quadratic in the momenta and there are not constraints we can write the

propagator for the system as being

system is also used to describe a Brownian particle coupled to an ohmic environment.

Note that the expression in brackets in Eq. (41) is a polynomial of degree sr in ξr. Now, if lr > sr, then by using
theorem (43), we get Ilr sr = 0. Because Ilr sr = Isr lr we also get a vanishing result for lr < sr. Then, the only non
vanishing result is obtained for lr = sr. Using again theorem (43) we note that the only non vanishing term of the
polynomial in brackets is the one of highest power. Since the highest power of Hn(x) is given by 2nxn we have for

that is nothing but Eq. (50). Also Eq. (51) can be written as

and

With these identiﬁcations the physical meaning of Eq. (50) is clear:
if initially we have a photon of frequency
ωk1 and the oscillator is in its ground state, then at time t, either the oscillator can go to its ﬁrst excited level by
absorbtion of the initial photon or can remain in its ground state scattering the initial photon to other photon of
arbitrary frequency.

Note that in establishing the identities (52) and (53) it is used only the orthogonality property of the matrix
tr
. Then, it is natural to ask whether it is possible to compute other probabilities without doing a direct

{
computation as performed in last section. The answer is yes. For example, if initially the oscillator is in its second
excited level and there are no photons, at time t it can happening that the oscillator continues in their second
excited level, it can go to their ﬁrst excited level by emission of photon of arbitrary frequency ωk1 or it can decay
to their ground state by emission of two photons of arbitrary frequencies ωk1 and ωk2 . The respective probabilities
are denoted by

As a second example we consider the oscillator is in its ﬁrst excited state and there is one photon of frequency
ωk1. At time t it can happen that: the oscillator go to its second excited level by absorbing the initial photon; or the
oscillator remains in its ﬁrst excited state and the initial photon is scattered to other photon of arbitrary frequency
ωk2; or maybe the oscillator can be decay to its ground state by emission of a photon of arbitrary frequency ωk2
and the initial photon is scattered to other photon of frequency ωk3 . The respective probabilities are denoted by

And so we can give all the probabilities associated to any decay or absorbtion process placing in the system.

5 Conclusions

We have shown that in the path-integral formalism the dressed coordinates appear as a coordinate transformation
preserving the quadric form deﬁning the ground state wave function of the system guaranting the vacuum stability
and, also it leads the functional measure of the path-integral invariant. If we look in the Hamiltonian formalism, it
can be shown that the linear transformation deﬁning the dressed coordinates also leads the canonical form of the
action invariant. Thus, we can also deﬁne the dressed coordinates via a canonical transformations.

Also, we perform the calculus of a transition amplitude using the dressed propagator and we arrive to the basic
formulae that is the initial point to deﬁne the sum rules presented in [11], then, in following we extend such rules
to other physical process. In spite of the computation looks very diﬃcult the dressed coordinates help us allowing
to use directly the orthogonality properties of the Hermite polynomials, simplifying greatly the calculus.

On the other hand, it has been made an extensive use of the model given by Eq. (1) to study diﬀerent physical
situations, such as the quantum Brownian motion, decoherence and other related problems in quantum optics.
Thus, we are interesting in the reduced matrix density of the model (1) in the framework of dressed coordinates
whose results of such analysis will be reported elsewhere.

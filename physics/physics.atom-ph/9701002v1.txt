We study the steady state in three-level lambda and
ladder systems. It is well-known that in a lambda sys-
tem this steady state is the coherent population trapping
state, independent of the presence of spontaneous emis-
sion. In contrast, the steady state in a ladder system is
in general not stable against radiative decay and exhibits
a minimum in the population of the ground state. We
show that incoherent population pumping destroys the
stability of the coherent population trapping state in the
lambda system and suppresses a previously discovered
sharp dip in the steady state response. In the ladder sys-
tem the observed minimum disappears in the presence of
an incoherent pump on the upper transition.

The ﬁrst observation in an optical pumping experiment
of what is now known as the phenomenon of coherent
population trapping (CPT) was made in 1976 by Alzetta
et al. [1]. They found that the ﬂuorescence intensity of
sodium vapour, illuminated by a laser and analyzed as a
function of an applied magnetic ﬁeld, decreased when the
diﬀerence in frequency of two laser modes matched some
hyperﬁne transitions of the ground state of sodium. A
theoretical explanation for this observation can be given
in terms of a three-level atomic system in which coherent
radiation ﬁelds couple two ground states, the initial and
ﬁnal state, to a common excited state. Under the two-
photon Raman resonance condition, when the frequency
diﬀerence of the radiation ﬁelds equals the separation
between the initial and ﬁnal level, population becomes
trapped in a coherent superposition of these two levels.
Since its discovery, many studies of CPT have appeared
using three-level lambda (Λ), ladder and V systems [2–6].
In addition, the concept of CPT has found interesting ap-
plications in, for example, the ﬁelds of laser cooling [7],
adiabatic population transfer [8] and lasing without in-
version [9–12].
Recently, Jyotsna and Agarwal [13] studied the dynamics
of the populations in a three-level Λ system with sponta-
neous emission (cf. FIG. 1(a)). They demonstrated that
the steady state reached by the system is always the CPT
state, irrespective of the strengths of the ﬁelds and the
rates of spontaneous emission. For weaker ﬁelds it only
takes longer times to reach the CPT state. Motivated by
this result, we investigate here the inﬂuence of incoherent
population pumping on one of the two transitions in the Λ
system. It will be shown that in the presence of this addi-

tional pumping mechanism, the steady state is no longer
the CPT state and that a suﬃciently strong rate of in-
coherent pumping suppresses the dip which was found in
the steady state response of a Λ system as a function of
detuning from the two-photon resonance condition [13].
Besides, we show that incoherent population pumping
has an interesting eﬀect on the steady state population
in another three-level conﬁguration, the ladder system
(FIG. 1(b)). It is well-known that in the absence of ra-
diative decay the ladder system also gives rise to coherent
population trapping [3]. Spontaneous emission from the
upper level destroys this trapping behaviour and leads
to a minimum in the population of the lower level. We
demonstrate that the minimum disappears in the pres-
ence of an incoherent pump.

Consider the three-level Λ system schematically de-

picted in FIG. 1(a).

Two states |2i and |3i are coupled to state |1i via clas-
sical monochromatic light ﬁelds of frequencies ω2 and ω3
respectively. Level |1i decays to the lower-lying level |2i
(|3i) by spontaneous emission with rate 2γ2 (2γ3). Let
Ω2 and Ω3, deﬁned as Ωj = µ1jEj/¯h (j = 2, 3), denote
the Rabi frequencies associated with the coupling by the
ﬁelds, with µ1j the dipole matrix interaction term be-
tween level 1 and level j, and Ej the amplitude of laser
ﬁeld j. The Hamiltonian for this system in the appropri-
ate rotating frame can be written as

In the absence of the incoherent pump, so λ = 0, the
steady state (3) equals the CPT state, which has been
studied by Jyotsna and Agarwal [13]. In the Λ system
with symmetric ﬁelds the population is then equally dis-
tributed between the two ground levels. Switching on
the incoherent pump and taking equal rates of sponta-
neous emission γ2 = γ3 ≡ γ, we have plotted in FIG. 2
the steady state populations ρ22 (dashed curves) and ρ33
(solid curves) as a function of the rate of spontaneous
emission for various pumping rates.

bottom (bottom to top) the solid (dashed) curves correspond
to λ = 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 respectively. For λ = 0, both popula-
tions are equal to 1/2 and independent of γ, which is indicated
by the thick line in the middle of the ﬁgure. Parameters used
are Ω2 = Ω3 = 10 and ∆2 = ∆3 = 0.

As soon as λ 6= 0, the distribution of population over
the two ground states becomes asymmetric (ρ33 > ρ22)
and the higher λ, the larger the diﬀerence between the
two. In fact, as γ → ∞, all curves for ρ33 go to 1, and
those for ρ22 go to 0, except if λ = 0. For suﬃciently
strong decay rates, the incoherent pump thus depletes
level |2i. This can be seen more clearly in FIG. 3, which
shows ρ22 on a larger scale for γ.

FIG. 2 also shows that ρ11 = ρ22 = ρ33 = 1/3 at γ = 0,
as long as λ 6= 0. In the absence of decay, the incoherent
pump distributes the population equally among the levels
of the Λ system, independent of λ and Ω.

Armed with the knowledge that incoherent population
pumping leads to a steady state which is diﬀerent from
the CPT state in the Λ system, one could ask how it
would aﬀect the dependence of ρ22 on the detuning ∆2.
The question arises because Jyotsna and Agarwal [13]
found that for weak ﬁelds and unequal decay rates γ2 and
γ3, ρ22 exhibits a sharp dip as a function of ∆2 around
the Raman resonance condition ∆2 = ∆3. They explain
that this happens because for unequal decay rates (say
γ2 > γ3), more population is present in state |2i than in
state |3i if ∆2 6= ∆3. But at the resonance condition,
state |2i always contains half of the population. Hence
a dip occurs around this value, which becomes sharper
with increasing γ2. For λ 6= 0, however, the steady state
at ∆2 = ∆3 is no longer the CPT state and level |2i
contains less than half of the total population. We have
calculated the steady state response of the Λ system with
incoherent pumping for ∆2 6= ∆3. The resulting expres-
sions are lengthy and therefore not given here. However,
the dependence of ρ22 on ∆2 for weak ﬁelds Ω ≪ γ2, γ3
is shown in FIG. 4.

We see an overall decrease in ρ22 as λ increases. The
dip in ρ22 completely disappears for λ ≃ Ω and ρ22 then
becomes independent of the detuning. This is expected
if incoherent pumping is the dominant pumping mecha-
nism, since the amount of detuning from the transition

is irrelevant for a pump with a linewidth much larger
than the transition width. The same behaviour occurs
for stronger ﬁelds, for which the dip is smoother [13].

Let us now consider the ladder system of FIG. 1(b)
with an incoherent pump on the |1i-|2i transition. The
Hamiltonian and the evolution equations of the reduced
density matrix for this system are similar to those of
the Λ conﬁguration and not given here (see eg. [10,11]).
From them the steady state solution is easily obtained.

We see that ρ33 exhibits a minimum in the absence
of incoherent population pumping. This minimum arises
because as soon as γ2 6= 0, the steady state in the lad-
der system deviates from the CPT state and level |1i
becomes populated. For small values of γ3 [16], level
|3i contributes to the population in level |1i and so ρ33
initially decreases with γ2. However, as γ2 increases fur-
ther, ρ33 approaches again the value 1/2 and hence the
minimum is formed.

The size of the minimum becomes smaller with increas-
ing λ and disappears for γ3 ≪ λ ≤ Ω. If the rate of in-
coherent pumping dominates the spontaneous emission
from level |2i, one can show that

The steady state populations have become independent
of γ2 in this limit and the upper two levels contain equal
amounts of population, as expected when the coupling

between these levels is large compared to the decay.

Summarizing, we analyzed the behaviour of the steady
state in atomic three-level Λ and ladder systems in the
presence of incoherent population pumping.
In the Λ
system the steady state is no longer equal to the CPT
state under inﬂuence of this pump. A similar decay of
the trapping state has recently been shown to occur due
to ﬂuctuations between two driving ﬁelds in a double-Λ
conﬁguration [17]. We have demonstrated that a suﬃ-
ciently strong rate of incoherent pumping suppresses the
sharp dip which was found in the steady state response
of the Λ system as a function of detuning ∆2 [13]. In the
ladder conﬁguration, the minimum which occurs in the
steady state population of the lowest level |3i as a func-
tion of the rate of spontaneous emission from the upper
level |2i disappears if the |1i − |2i transition is incoher-
ently pumped.

Other works on three-level atomic level schemes have
demonstrated that phase-diﬀusion in the pumping ﬁelds
has substantial eﬀects on coherence phenomena such as
the gain in a lasing without inversion (LWI) ladder sys-
tem [18] and the refractive index enhancement in a V
conﬁguration [19]. These phase ﬂuctuations in the driv-
ing ﬁelds are also known to lead to a decay of the CPT
state in Λ systems [4,17] and thus their eﬀect seems to
be qualitatively similar to that of incoherent population
pumping. Another point of consideration is that we have
only studied dilute media of Λ and ladder systems here.
In order to treat dense media, local-ﬁeld corrections have
to be taken into account. It has been shown for the co-
herently pumped Λ system that CPT persists in dense
media for all ﬁeld strengths [20] and it would be interest-
ing to see what the result is of including an incoherent
pump.

Using a technique based on production of ion Coulomb crystals, the isotope shifts of the 4s2
1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 transition for all naturally occurring isotopes of calcium as well as the hyperﬁne
splitting of the 4s5p 1P1 state in 43Ca have been measured. The ﬁeld shift and speciﬁc mass shift
coeﬃcients as well as the hyperﬁne structure constants for 43Ca have been derived from the data.

INTRODUCTION

Isotope shifts and hyperﬁne splitting of optical transi-
tions provide valuable information about atomic electron
conﬁgurations and not at least properties of the nuclei.
While from isotope shifts, nuclear charge distributions
can be deduced (see, e.g., Refs [1, 2]), from hyperﬁne
splittings, nuclear spins, magnetic dipole moments, and
electric quadrupole moments can be determined [3].

Although isotope shifts and hyperﬁne splittings al-
ready have been measured for a large number of tran-
sitions in neutral Ca (see Refs. [4, 5, 6] and references
therein) and in singly charged Ca+ ions [7, 8, 9], the
4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 transition considered in the present
paper has hitherto not been measured.
In contrast to
previous experiments, the present measurements use ion
Coulomb crystals as means to obtain the spectroscopic
data.

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

In the experiments, we have used a frequency doubled
cw laser system tuned to the 4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 tran-
sition at a wavelength of λ ≈ 272 nm. The degree of
excitation at a particular wavelength is determined from
the ion production rate when excited neutral Ca atoms
absorb yet another λ ≈ 272 nm photon directly from the
4s5p 1P1 state or from the metastable 4s3d 1D0 state,
populated through spontaneous emission as depicted in
Fig. 1(a) [10]. As shown in the sketch of the experi-
mental setup in Fig. 2(a), the spectroscopic laser beam
at λ ≈ 272 nm crosses a well-collimated eﬀusive ther-
mal beam of calcium atoms at right angles in the center
of a linear Paul trap [11]. This geometry is chosen in
order to obtain small Doppler shifts of the transition un-
der study as well as to have a large capture eﬃciency
of the ions produced. Since the atomic beam is derived

Netherlands.

from an oven containing natural metallic calcium, all the
isotopes 40Ca (96.9%), 42Ca (0.647%), 43Ca (0.135%),
44Ca (2.086%), 46Ca (0.004%), and 48Ca (0.187%) are
present. The detection of the ions produced within a
given exposure period is done by ﬁrst trapping them in-
dependently of the speciﬁc isotope, and then converting
almost all ions into 40Ca+ through near-resonant elec-
tron transfer collisions with atoms in the atomic beam
containing 96.9% 40Ca atoms. Finally, the number of
trapped ions is counted with a near-100% eﬃciency by
monitoring the ﬂuorescence from the 40Ca+ ions when
laser cooled into a Coulomb crystal [12, 13]. Below, the
key parts of the applied technique are discussed in detail.

A.

Isotope and hyperﬁne selective ion production

The laser system used for the spectroscopy consists of
a tunable, single-mode ring CW dye laser operated at 544
nm with an output power of a few hundreds mW which
is frequency doubled to 272 nm by a β-Barium Borate
crystal placed in an external cavity. The output power
at the desired 4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 transition wavelength
is typically about ∼ 10 mW, and the laser linewidth is
below 1 MHz. This linewidth is much smaller than the

atoms at this frequency. Counting the number of pro-
duced ions as a function of laser frequency thus reveals
the excitation spectrum.

2

B. The ion detection scheme

The central element of the ion detection is the linear
Paul trap situated in a vacuum chamber which is op-
erated at a pressure of ∼ 10−10 Torr. As sketched in
Fig. 2(b), the trap consists of four sectioned cylindrical
electrodes placed in a quadrupole conﬁguration. Con-
ﬁnement of ions in the xy plane is obtained by an ef-
fective radial harmonical potential created by applying
a rf-potential of amplitude URF and frequency ΩRF to
each of the electrodes in such a way that the voltage
on the diagonally opposite electrode is in phase while
the voltage of the neighbouring electrodes is 180◦ out
of phase. Along the trap axis, the z-axis, conﬁnement
originates from a positive dc voltage UEC applied to all
the eight end-pieces. With the trap dimensions used [see
Fig. 2(b)], for URF ∼ 200 V, Ω = 2π × 3.9 MHz and
UEC ∼ 5 V, the eﬀective trap depth becomes ∼ 1 eV.
This ensures that ions produced in the trapping region
are eﬃciently trapped despite the thermal velocities of
the neutral atoms.

When ions of a certain calcium isotope, e.g., 40Ca+,
are produced, they can be Doppler laser-cooled by driv-
ing the 4s S1/2 → 4p P1/2 and the 3d D3/2 → 4p P1/2
transitions by laser light around 397 nm and 866 nm,
respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1(b). As the ions are
cooled to suﬃciently low temperatures (∼ 10 mK), they
arrange in a spatial ordered structure, often referred to
as an ion Coulomb crystal.
In our setup, these ion
Coulomb crystals are imaged onto an image intensiﬁed
Charge-coupled device camera by collecting ﬂuorescence
from the Doppler cooled ions. A typical picture of a
Coulomb crystal containing ∼ 10 000 40Ca+ ions is shown
in Fig. 3. Here, one clearly observes the elliptical projec-
tion of the crystal, which for our trapping potential is
spheroidal with the trap axis (z axis) as the axis of rota-
tional symmetry. Single-component Coulomb crystals in
our trap have spatially uniform ion densities when viewed
on length scales larger than the typical distance between
neighboring ions (see Ref. [15]). The speciﬁc density is
set by the trapping parameters. Hence, by determining
the crystal volumes, e.g., by measuring the main axis of
the projected ellipse, we can determine the total number
of trapped ions.

Generally, when the frequency of the spectroscopy laser
is tuned between the resonances the various isotopes, two
or more singly charged calcium isotope ions will be pro-
duced and trapped. Such multispecies ion ensembles can
be cooled into Coulomb crystals as well, with the lighter
isotopes more tightly bound towards the trap axis than
the heavier due to the dynamical conﬁnement in the xy
plane [15]. In Fig. 4(a), an image of the ﬂuorescence from
laser cooled 40Ca+ ions in such a crystal is shown. The

full width at half maximum(FWHM) Doppler width of
∼ 50 MHz due to the transverse velocity spread of the
thermal atomic beam originating from an oven at a tem-
perature of ∼ 600◦C. Hence, since the natural linewidth
of the 4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 transition according to the
NIST database [14] is known to be Γ ≈ 2 MHz (> 50%
uncertainty), the Doppler eﬀect is the resolution limiting
factor in the experiments. With isotope shifts typically
of the order of GHz and hyperﬁne splittings of about ∼
100 MHz of 43Ca, not only can one selectively excite indi-
vidual even isotopes (no nuclear spin), but also the three
hyperﬁne components of the 4s5p 1P1 state in the case
of 43Ca. As mentioned above, ions are produced from
excited calcium atoms either by absorbing yet another
λ ≈ 272 nm photon directly from the 4s5p 1P1 state, or
from the metastable 4s3d 1D0 state populated through
spontaneous decay. By exposing the atomic beam to the
photoionization laser beam with a certain frequency for
a ﬁxed period of time (in our experiment controlled by a
mechanical light shutter), the ion production will reﬂect
the excitation degree of the 4s5p 1P1 state of calcium

crystal consists mainly of 40Ca+- and 44Ca+ ions, where
the nonﬂuorescing 44Ca+ ions are cooled only sympathet-
ically through the Coulomb interaction with the directly
laser cooled 40Ca+ ions [16, 17]. The number of ions in
the multicomponent crystal could principally be deter-
mined by imaging the ﬂuorescence from the individual
isotopes. This is, however, technically very demanding,
since each isotope ion would need its own set of laser fre-
quencies due to isotope shifts of the transitions shown
in Fig. 1(b). As an alternative route to quantify the
total ion production, we choose to expose the multicom-
ponent crystals similar to the one in Fig. 4(a) to the
thermal atomic beam of calcium until nearly all the ions
(∼ 96.9%) by near-resonant electron transfer collisions of
the type

ACa+ +40 Ca →A Ca +40 Ca+

(1)

have been converted into 40Ca+ ions, and subsequently
we measure the size of the now nearly pure 40Ca+ crys-
tal. Since the energy diﬀerence between the two sides of
Eq. (1) is just the isotope shift of the electronic levels,
which is much smaller than the thermal energy of the
atoms in the beam, no signiﬁcant energy barrier exists
for the process. Furthermore, since the kinetic energy
of the produced 40Ca+ ions is more than an order of
magnitude smaller than the trap potential depth, essen-
tially 100% of the ions produced through Eq. (1) stay

sented in Fig. 4(a) has been converted via the electron
transfer process into a nearly pure 40Ca+ crystal.

III. SPECTROSCOPIC RESULTS

A. The 4s5p 1P1 excitation spectrum

Figure 5 shows the relative ion production rate or,
equivalently, the relative rate at which calcium atoms
are being excited to the 1P1 state, as a function of the
detuning of the spectroscopy laser. These relative rates

were obtained from knowledge of the volumes of the cre-
ated Coulomb crystals, the laser exposure times, and
the intensities of the spectroscopy laser. The spectrum
contains resonances of all the naturally abundant iso-
topes, including the one corresponding to 46Ca which
has a natural abundance of only 0.004%. The results
presented in Fig. 5 have been obtained from three par-
tially overlapping frequency scans. The three data se-
ries were measured at slightly diﬀerent oven tempera-
tures: Toven = 612◦C (△), Toven = 630◦C ((cid:4)), and
Toven = 602◦C ((cid:3)). The relative rates of the △ data
and the (cid:4) data have been normalized, so they share the
same ﬁtted maximum value and position at the 42Ca res-
onance peak. In the same way the data indicated by (cid:4)
and (cid:3) have been normalized to the three 43Ca hyperﬁne
peaks.

The temperature was during each experiment kept sta-
ble to better than ±2◦C corresponding to a maximum
uncertainty in the atomic density of about ±7% during
the whole data accumulation time of ∼ 40 min. Since the
time to measure a single resonance is only a very small
fraction of this time, any systematic errors in the reso-
nance proﬁles due to ﬂuctuating oven temperatures can
be neglected. The Doppler broadening of the resonances,
which only depends slightly on the atomic mass, is best
found by ﬁtting the 40Ca resonance data to a Voigt pro-
ﬁle. By doing this one obtains a total FWHM of ∼ 54 ± 5
MHz dominated by the Doppler broadening. At the laser
intensity which we apply (∼ 100 mW/cm2), we have as-
sumed that neither the 4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 transition nor
the following photoionization process is saturated. Con-
sequently, the ion production rate is expected to be pro-
portional to the laser intensity squared. We accounted

for ﬂuctuations in the spectroscopic laser intensity dur-
ing the data accumulation time by using this assumption.
That this assumption is rather good is supported by not-
ing that the relative measured resonance peak values in
Fig. 5 are in good agreement with the natural abundances
of the calcium isotopes, which are 40Ca (96.9%), 42Ca
(0.647%), 43Ca (0.135%), 44Ca (2.086%), 46Ca (0.004%),
and 48Ca (0.187%).

certainties are accounted for in a weighted least-squares
Gaussian ﬁt, the uncertainty on the resonance position
becomes lower than 2 MHz.

A more critical error arises when we compare similar
scans. Here we ﬁnd that the measured resonance peak
positions are associated with much larger uncertainties
than the ones from the Gaussian ﬁts. This additional
error originates from local frequency drift of the spec-
troscopy laser during a whole scan which typically lasts
about 40 min. From a series of scans, we have found
that this laser drift error leads to a rms uncertainty in
the resonance frequencies of about 9 MHz. This last error
source is the dominant one for the estimated errors of the
isotope shifts given in Table I. In this table, the isotope
shift for 43Ca is found as the center of gravity of the three
hyperﬁne components of 43Ca which will be discussed in
Sec. III C. In addition to these statistical errors, there
is also a systematic uncertainty of ±1% arising from the
calibration of the spectroscopy laser frequency scan to
an optical spectrum analyzer with a known free-spectral
range.

For completeness, we have estimated that we might
have introduced an unimportant error of a few hundred
kHz due to the fact that we have determined the res-
onance frequencies from single Gaussian ﬁts instead as
from a more realistic multipeak Voigt proﬁle ﬁt.

Isotope shifts

Before deriving the isotope shifts from data like the
ones presented in Fig. 5, the uncertainty of the individ-
ual data points has to be estimated and taken into ac-
count. The uncertainty is essentially due to three eﬀects.
First, due to intensity ﬂuctuations of the laser intensity
there will be a ﬂuctuation in the number of ions pro-
duced. Since for neighboring data points around a reso-
nance this intensity ﬂuctuation is maximally a few per-
cent, the expected square dependence on the intensity of
the ion production leads to an estimated uncertainty of
∼ 5%. Second, in determination of the Coulomb crystal
volumes, both systematic and random uncertainties due
to the measurements of the main axis of the elliptical
projections of the crystals occur. Both these errors are
of about ∼ 5%, but since the systematic errors are equal
for points symmetrically positioned around a resonance,
it will have a small eﬀect on the determination of the
resonance frequencies. Hence, in our analysis, we have
only accounted for the random errors of 5%. Finally, due

TABLE I: Isotope shifts of the transition 4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1
in calcium derived from the experimental data like the ones
presented in Fig. 5. All shifts are with respect to the 40Ca
resonance. The errors stated represent one standard deviation
originating from the statistical errors in the experiments. In
addition, the shifts are subject to an overall linear scaling
uncertainty of 1% due to our frequency scan calibration (see
text). The isotope shift for 43Ca is the center of gravity of
the hyperﬁne components.

The isotope shift for a given transition is usually de-
scribed as a sum of the mass and the ﬁeld shift in the
following way [1]

′

A′ − A
AA′ + F δhr2iAA

,

(2)

where M is the mass shift coeﬃcient, A and A′ denote
the atomic masses of the two isotopes, F is the ﬁeld shift
coeﬃcient, and δhr2iAA
is the diﬀerence in mean square
nuclear charge radii between the isotopes.

′

The mass shift is usually written as a sum of the nor-
mal mass shift (NMS) and the speciﬁc mass shift (SMS),
which means that we can write the mass shift coeﬃcient
as M = MN MS + MSMS. Here the NMS coeﬃcient
is given by the simple expression MN MS = ν0me/mu,
where ν0 is the transition frequency, me is the electron
mass, and mu is the atomic mass unit. The NMS origi-
nates from the reduced mass correction for the electron,
while the SMS comes from the change in the correlated
motion of all the electrons (see, e.g., Ref. [18]). Subtrac-
tion of the NMS from the total isotope-shift gives the
residual isotope shift (RIS),

for
the ﬁxed value of A = 40. The SMS coeﬃcient and ﬁeld
shift coeﬃcient, obtained by weighted linear regression
ﬁt to the data points in Fig. 6, are listed in Table II.

most equal to the experimentally determined ﬁeld shift

F = −175.8±1.2 MHz/fm2 reported in Ref. [5]. This can
be attributed to the fact that a p electron has negligible

the main contribution to the ﬁeld shifts is expected in
both cases to come from the s electrons.

43Ca hyperﬁne splitting

The nuclear spin of I = 7/2 for 43Ca leads to three
hyperﬁne levels of the 1P1 state with total spins F =
5/2, 7/2, and 9/2, respectively. The hyperﬁne structure
(hfs) constants and isotope shift of 43Ca are determined
by ﬁtting to the normal Casimir formula [3]

where C = F (F + 1)− I(I + 1)− J(J + 1), ∆νcg is the iso-
tope shift of the center of gravity of the hfs, and A and B
are the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole coupling
constants, respectively. Several scans across the three
hyperﬁne resonances were made to increase the level of
conﬁdence of the A and B constants. The hfs constants
derived from these scans are summarized in Table III,
while the center of gravity for 43Ca has been given in
Table I. The small value of the B constant indicates
that the magnetic dipole coupling has the most promi-
nent contribution to lifting the degeneracy of the 4s5p
1P1 level for 43Ca. Compared with the work of Ref. [5],
where the hfs constants for the 4s4p 1P1 state in 43Ca
have been measured to be A = −15.54 ± 0.03 MHz and
B = −3.48 ± 0.13 MHz, the 4s5p 1P1 state has an op-
posite sign for the A constant and the B constant is the
same order of magnitude or smaller.

IV. CONCLUSION

With a technique based on determining the number of
ions produced, collected, and cooled into Coulomb crys-
tals through resonant two-photon ionization, the isotope
shifts of the 4s2 1S0 → 4s5p 1P1 transition for all nat-
urally occurring isotopes of calcium as well as the hy-
perﬁne splitting of the 4s5p 1P1 state in 43Ca have been
measured. The ﬁeld shift and speciﬁc mass shift coef-
ﬁcients as well as the hyperﬁne structure constants for
43Ca have been derived from the data. Though in the
presented experimental scheme, near-resonant charge ex-
change collisions were used to gain information about the
ion number, it is not a requirement for the technique for

6

these to be used. Actually, the technique should be ap-
plicable to many atomic species as long as some laser
cooled ions are simultaneously trapped and can sympa-
thetically cool the species of interest into a Coulomb crys-
tal [17, 19, 20]. From the spatial organization of the ob-
servable laser cooled species, one can easily deduce the
number of the, e.g., nonﬂuorescing ions of interest.

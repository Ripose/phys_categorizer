Dipolar Bose and Fermi gases, which are currently being studied extensively experimentally and theoretically,
interact through anisotropic, long-range potentials. Here, we replace the long-range potential by a zero-range
pseudo-potential that simpliﬁes the theoretical treatment of two dipolar particles in a harmonic trap. Our zero-
range pseudo-potential description reproduces the energy spectrum of two dipoles interacting through a shape-
dependent potential under external conﬁnement very well, provided that sufﬁciently many partial waves are
included, and readily leads to a classiﬁcation scheme of the energy spectrum in terms of approximate angular
momentum quantum numbers. The results may be directly relevant to the physics of dipolar gases loaded into
optical lattices.

INTRODUCTION

Many-body systems with dipolar interactions have attracted
a lot of attention recently. Unlike the properties of ultra-
cold atomic alkali vapors, which can be described to a very
good approximation by a single scattering quantity (the s-
wave scattering length), those of dipolar gases additionally
depend on the dipole moment. This dipole moment can be
magnetic, as in the case of atomic Cr [1, 2], or electric, as
in the case of heteronuclear molecules such as OH [3, 4],
KRb [5] or RbCs [6]. Furthermore, dipolar interactions are
long-ranged and anisotropic, giving rise to a host of novel
many-body effects in conﬁned dipolar gases such as roton-
like features [7, 8, 9] and rich stability diagrams [10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The physics of dipolar gases loaded into
optical lattices promises to be particularly rich. For example,
this setup constitutes the starting point for a range of quan-
tum computing schemes [18, 19, 20, 21]. Additionally, a va-
riety of novel quantum phases have already been predicted to
arise [22, 23, 24, 25]. Currently, a number of experimental
groups are working towards loading dipolar gases into optical
lattices.

This paper investigates the physics of doubly-occupied op-
tical lattice sites in the regime where the tunneling between
neighboring sites and the interactions with dipoles located in
other lattice sites can be neglected.
In this case, the prob-
lem reduces to treating the interactions between two dipoles
in a single lattice site. Assuming that the lattice potential
can be approximated by a harmonic potential, the center of
mass motion separates and the problem reduces to solving
the Schrödinger equation for the relative distance vector ~r
between the two dipoles. The interaction between the two
aligned dipoles is angle-dependent and falls off as 1/r3 at
large interparticle distances.
In this work, we replace the
shape-dependent interaction potential by an angle-dependent
zero-range pseudo-potential, which is designed to reproduce
the scattering properties of the full shape-dependent interac-
tion potential, and derive an implicit eigenequation for two
interacting identical bosonic dipoles and two interacting iden-
tical fermionic dipoles analytically.

Replacing the full

interaction potential or a shape-

dependent pseudo-potential by a
zero-range pseudo-
potential [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] often allows for an
analytical description of ultracold two-body systems in
terms of a few key physical quantities. Here we show
that the eigenequation for appropriately chosen zero-range
pseudo-potentials reproduces the energy spectrum of two
interacting through
dipoles under harmonic conﬁnement
a shape-dependent model potential;
that the applied zero-
range treatment readily leads to an approximate classiﬁcation
scheme of the energy spectrum in terms of angular momentum
quantum numbers; and that the proposed pseudo-potential
treatment breaks down when the characteristic length of the
dipolar interaction becomes comparable to the characteristic
length of the external conﬁnement. The detailed understand-
ing of two interacting dipoles obtained in this paper will
guide optical lattice experiments and the search for novel
many-body effects.

Section II introduces the Hamiltonian under study and dis-
cusses the anisotropic zero-range pseudo-potential that is used
to describe the scattering between two interacting dipoles. In
Sec. III, we derive an implicit eigen equation for two dipoles
under external spherical harmonic conﬁnement interacting
through the zero-range pseudo-potential and show that the
resulting eigenenergies agree well with those obtained for a
shape-dependent model potential. Finally, Sec. IV concludes.

II. SYSTEM UNDER STUDY AND ANISOTROPIC
PSEUDO-POTENTIAL

Within the mean-ﬁeld Gross-Pitaevskii formalism, the in-
teraction between two identical bosonic dipoles, aligned along
the space-ﬁxed ˆz-axis by an external ﬁeld, has been success-
fully modeled by the pseudo-potential Vpp(~r) [11],

Vpp(~r) =

(1)

Here, µ denotes the reduced mass of the two-dipole system,
d the dipole moment, and q
the angle between ˆz and the rel-
ative distance vector ~r. The s-wave scattering length a00 de-

pends on both the short- and long-range parts of the true in-
teraction potential. The second term on the right hand side of
Eq. (1) couples angular momentum states with l = l′ (l > 0)
and
= 2 (any l, l′). For identical fermions, s-wave scat-
tering is absent and the interaction is described, assuming the
long-range dipole-dipole interaction is dominant, by the sec-
ond term on the right hand side of Eq. (1).

Our goal in this paper is to determine the eigenequation
of two identical bosonic dipoles and two identical fermionic
dipoles under external spherically harmonic conﬁnement with
angular trapping frequency w
analytically. The Schrödinger
equation for the relative position vector~r reads

[H0 + Vint(~r)]y (~r) = Ey (~r),

where the Hamiltonian H0 of the non-interacting harmonic os-
cillator is given by

(3)

In Eq. (2), Vint(~r) denotes the interaction potential. The
pseudo-potential Vpp(~r) cannot be used directly in Eq. (2)
since both parts of the pseudo-potential lead to divergencies.
The divergence of the d -function potential arises from the sin-
gular 1/r behavior at small r of the spherical Neumann func-
tion n0(r), and can be cured by introducing the regularization
operator ¶
¶ r r [27]. Curing the divergence of the long-ranged
1/r3 term of Vpp is more involved, since it couples an inﬁ-
nite number of angular momentum states, each of which gives
rise to a singularity in the r
0 limit. The nature of each of
→
these singularities depends on the quantum numbers l and l′
coupled by the pseudo-potential, and hence has to be cured
separately for each l and l′ combination.

In this work, we follow Derevianko [33, 34] and cure the di-
vergencies by replacing Vpp(~r) with a regularized zero-range
potential Vpp,reg(~r), which contains inﬁnitely many terms,

Vpp,reg(~r) = (cid:229)

Vll′

(~r).

(4)

ll′
The sum in Eq. (4) runs over l and l′ even for identical bosons,
and over l and l′ odd for identical fermions. For l
= l′, Vll′
and Vl′l are different and both terms have to be included in
the sum. In Sec. III, we apply the pseudo-potential to sys-
tems under spherically symmetric external conﬁnement. For
these systems, the projection quantum number m is a good
quantum number, i.e., the energy spectrum for two interact-
ing dipoles under spherically symmetric conﬁnement can be
solved separately for each allowed m value. Consequently, a
separate pseudo-potential can be constructed for each m value.
In the following, we restrict ourselves to systems with vanish-
ing projection quantum number m; the generalization of the
pseudo-potential to general m is discussed at the end of this
are deﬁned through their action on an arbi-
section. The Vll′

where k denotes the relative wave vector, k =

the all′
ourselves to m = 0, the Vll′
are written in terms of the spherical
harmonics Ylm with m = 0. When applying the above pseudo-
potential we treat a large number of terms in Eq. (4), and do
not terminate the sum after the ﬁrst three terms as done in
Refs. [33, 34, 35]. We note that the non-Hermiticity of Vpp,reg
does not lead to problems when determining the energy spec-
trum; however, great care has to be taken when calculating,
e.g., structural expectation values [36].

To understand the functional form of the zero-range
pseudo-potential deﬁned in Eqs. (4) through (6), let us ﬁrst
consider the piece of Eq. (5) in square brackets. If we decom-
pose the incoming wave F (~r) into partial waves,

F (~r) = (cid:229)

where the cnilimi denote expansion coefﬁcients and the Qnili
radial basis functions, the spherical harmonic Yl0 in the inte-
grand of Vll′
acts as a projector or ﬁlter. After the integra-
tion over the angles, only those components of F (~r) that have
li = l and mi = 0 survive. The operator ¶ 2l+1
¶ r2l+1 rl+1 in Eq. (5) is
1 divergencies of the Qnil,
designed to then ﬁrst cure the r−
which arise in the r
0 limit, and to then second “extract” the
coefﬁcients of the regular part of the Qnil(r) that go as rl [27].
Alltogether, this shows that the square bracket in Eq. (5) re-
0 limit is taken. To under-
duces to a constant when the r
stand the remaining pieces of the pseudo-potential, we mul-
tiply Eq. (5) from the left with Q∗nolo
and integrate over
all space. The spherical harmonic Yl′0 in Eq. (5) then ensures
that the integral is only non-zero when l′ = lo and mo = 0.
When performing the radial integration, the d (r)/rl′ term en-
sures that the coefﬁcients of the regular part of the Qnolo that
go as rlo are being extracted (note that the remaining 1/r2 term
cancels the r2 in the volume element).

Alltogether, the analysis outlined in the previous paragraph
ensures that the diver-
shows that the functional form of Vll′
gencies of the radial parts of the incoming and outgoing wave
is cured in the r
0 limit and that the lth component of the
incoming wave is scattered into the l′th partial wave. The
sum over all l and l′ values in Eq. (4) guarantees that any
state with quantum number l can be coupled to any state with
quantum number l′, provided the corresponding generalized
is non-zero. We note that the regularized
scattering length all′
pseudo-potential given by Eqs. (4) through (6) is only appro-
priate if the external conﬁning potential in Eq. (3) has spher-
ical symmetry [37]. Generalizations of the above zero-range
pseudo-potential, aimed at treating interacting dipoles under
elongated conﬁnement, require the regularization scheme to
be modiﬁed to additionally cure divergencies of cylindrically
symmetric wave functions. These extensions will be subject
of future studies.

range dipolar and a short-ranged repulsive part, of two inter-
acting dipoles. As discussed further in Sec. III, an approach
along these lines is used to obtain the squares shown in Fig. 3.
Alternatively, it has been shown that the K-matrix elements

the Rb-Rb potential in a strong electric ﬁeld [11] or an OH-
OH model potential [16], are approximated with high accu-
racy by the K-matrix elements for the dipolar potential only,
calculated in the ﬁrst Born approximation. Applying the Born

range pseudo-potential construction and proofs that the pref-
are correct. In turn, this suggests that the appli-
actors of Vll′

used to quantify the scattering
eralized scattering lengths all′
are approximated by Eqs. (9) and (10). The
strengths of Vll′

that of Vpp if the full energy-dependent K-matrix of a realistic
potential is used instead.

III. TWO DIPOLES UNDER EXTERNAL CONFINEMENT

Section III A derives the implicit eigenequation for two
dipoles interacting through the pseudo-potential under exter-
nal harmonic conﬁnement and Section III B analyzes the re-
sulting eigen spectrum.

A. Derivation of the eigenequation

To determine the eigen energies of two aligned dipoles
with m = 0 under spherical harmonic conﬁnement interacting
through the zero-range potential Vpp,reg, we expand the eigen-
functions Y
(~r) in terms of the orthonormal harmonic oscilla-
tor eigen functions RniliYli0,

(~r) = (cid:229)

cniliRnili(r)Yli0(q , f ).

(11)

nili

The pseudo-potential Vpp,reg enforces the proper boundary
condition of Y
(~r) at r = 0, and thus determines the expan-
sion coefﬁcients cnili . To introduce the key ideas we ﬁrst con-
sider s-wave interacting particles [28], for which the pseudo-
potential reduces to a single term, and then consider the gen-
eral case, in which the pseudo-potential contains inﬁnitely
many terms.

Including only the term with l and l′ = 0 in Eq. (4), the

Schrödinger equation becomes,

cnili(Enili −

E + V00)Rnili(r)Yli0(q , f ) = 0,

Multiplying Eq. (12) from the left with R∗nolo
Y ∗lo0 with lo >

li > 0 vanish. This can be understood readily by realizing
that the s-wave pseudo-potential V00, as discussed in detail in
Sec. II, only couples states with l = l′ = 0. To determine the
expansion coefﬁcients cni0, we multiply Eq. (12) from the left
with R∗no0Y ∗00 and integrate over all space. This results in

The three terms in the square bracket in the second line of

Importantly, the constants Blo
2, Blo and Blo+2, deﬁned in
2, lo and lo + 2,
Eq. (20), depend on the quantum numbers lo
respectively, which implies that Eq. (19) deﬁnes a set of in-
ﬁnitely many coupled equations that determine, together with
Eq. (20), the expansion coefﬁcients cnili . Notice that Eqs. (19)
and (20) coincide with Eqs. (15) and (16) if we set lo = 0 and
gll′

= 0 if l or l′ > 0.
We now illustrate how Eqs. (19) and (20) can be solved for
identical bosons, i.e., in the case where l and l′ are even (the
derivation for identical fermions proceeds analogously). Our
strategy is to solve these equations by including successively
more terms in the coupled equations, or equivalently, in the
pseudo-potential. As discussed above, if a00 is the only non-
zero scattering length, the eigenenergies are given by Eq. (18).
Next, we also allow for non-zero a20, a02 and a22, i.e., we con-
sider l and l′ ≤
2 in Eq. (4). In this case, the coefﬁcients cni0
and cni2 are non-zero and coupled, but all cnili with li > 2 are
zero. Using the expressions for B0 and B2 given in Eq. (20),
we decouple the equations. Finally, using Eqs. (27) and (32)
from the Appendix, the eigenequation can be compactly writ-
ten as

Equation (21) can be understood as follows.
If only a00 is
non-zero, it reduces to t0 = 0, in agreement with Eq. (18). If
only a00, a02 and a20 are non-zero, Eq. (21) remains valid if
a22 in t2 is set to zero. This shows that the term q2 and the
ﬁrst term on the right hand side of t2 arise due to the coupling
between states with angular momenta 0 and 2. The second
term of t2, in contrast, arises due to a non-zero a22. Finally,
for non-zero a00 and a22 but vanishing a20 and a02, Eq. (21)
reduces to t0t2 = 0. In this case, we recover the eigenequations
t0 = 0 for s-wave interacting particles [28] and t2 = 0 for d-
wave interacting particles [32].

We now consider l and l′ values with up to lmax = 4 in
Eq. (4), i.e., we additionally allow for non-zero a24, a42 and
a44, and discuss how the solution changes compared to the
lmax = 2 case. The equation for the expansion coefﬁcients
cni0 remains unchanged while that for cni2 is modiﬁed. Fur-
thermore, the expansion coefﬁcients cni4 are no longer zero.
Consequently, we have three coupled equations, which can be
decoupled, resulting in the following implicit eigenequation,
t0 + q2/(t2 + q4/t4) = 0. In analogy to the lmax = 2 case, the q4
term and the ﬁrst part on the right hand side of the t4 term arise
due to the “off-diagonal” scattering lengths a24 and a42, and
the second term of t4 arises due to the “diagonal” scattering
length a44.

let us assume that we have found the implicit

B. Analysis of the energy spectrum

This section analyses the implicit eigenequation, Eq. (24),
derived in the previous section for the zero-range pseudo-
potential for m = 0 and compares the resulting energy spec-
trum with that obtained for a shape-dependent model poten-
tial. The implicit eigenequation, Eq. (24), can be solved
readily numerically by ﬁnding its roots in different energy
regions. The solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the
shape-dependent model potential are otained by expanding the
eigenfunctions on a B-spline basis.

Lines in Figs. 1(a) and (b) show the eigenenergies obtained
by solving Eq. (24) for two identical bosons and two iden-
tical fermions, respectively, interacting through Vps,reg(~r) un-
der external spherically symmetric harmonic conﬁnement as
a function of the dipole length D

sume that the interaction between the two dipoles is purely
dipolar, i.e., in Fig. 1(a) we set a00 = 0. The other scattering

In addition to obtaining the eigenenergies themselves, the
pseudo-potential treatment allows the spectrum to be classi-
ﬁed in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers. To
this end, we solve the implicit eigenequation, Eq. (24), for
increasing lmax, and monitor how the energy levels shift as ad-
ditional angular momenta are included in Vpp,reg. Since a level
with approximate quantum number l changes only little as
larger angular momentum values are included in the pseudo-
potential, this analysis reveals the predominant character of
each energy level. In Fig. 1(a), the eigenfunctions of energies
shown by solid, dashed and dotted lines have predominantly
l = 0, 2 and 4 character, respectively. In Fig. 1(b), the eigen-
functions of energies shown by solid, dashed and dotted lines
have predominantly l = 1, 3 and 5 character, respectively. We
ﬁnd that the lowest excitation frequency between states with
predominantly l = 0 [l = 1] character, increases [decreases]
for identical bosons [fermions] with increasing D
. These pre-
dictions can be veriﬁed directly experimentally.

∗

To assess the accuracy of the developed zero-range pseudo-
potential treatment, we consider two interacting bosons with
non-vanishing s-wave scattering length a00. We imagine that
the dipole moment of two identical polarized bosonic polar
molecules is tuned by an external electric ﬁeld. As the dipole
moment d is tuned, the s-wave scattering length a00, which
depends on the short-range and the long-range physics of the
“true” interaction potential, changes. To model this situation,
we solve the two-body Schrödinger equation, Eq. (2), numer-
ically for a shape-dependent model potential with hardcore

For the model potential Vmodel, a00 depends on the ratio
between the short-range and long-range length scales, i.e.,
on b/D

energies for the model potential, we ﬁx b and calculate a00
for each D
considered. The dipole-dependent s-wave scat-
tering length is then used in the zero-range pseudo-potential
Vpp,reg. The other scattering lengths are, as before, approx-
imated by the expressions given in Eqs. (9) and (10). Solid

energies close to that D
value at which the two-body poten-
tial Vmodel supports a new bound state. The blow-up, Fig. 2(b),

ergies obtained using Vpp,reg (crosses) and those obtained us-

As before, we can assign approximate quantum numbers to
aho, the three energy levels around
each energy level. At D
E
have, from bottom to top, approximate quantum
numbers l = 2, 4 and 0. After two closely spaced avoided
crossings around D
0.025aho, the assignment changes to
l = 0, 2 and 4 (again, from bottom to top). If the maximum
angular momentum lmax of the pseudo-potential is set to 2, the
energy level with approximate quantum number l = 4 would
be absent entirely. This illustrates that a complete and accu-
rate description of the energy spectrum requires the use of a
zero-range pseudo-potential with inﬁnitely many terms. The
energy of a state with approximate quantum number l requires
lmax to be at least l for the correct degeneracy be obtained and
at least l + 2 for a quantitative description.
The sequence of avoided crossings at D

0.025aho sug-
gests an interesting experiment. Assume that the system
/aho), pre-
is initially, at small electric ﬁeld (i.e., small D
pared in the excited state with angular momentum l
0 and
. The electric ﬁeld is then slowly swept across the
E
0.019aho to transfer the
ﬁrst broad avoided crossing at D
population from the state with l
2.
We then suggest to sweep quickly across the second narrower
0.028aho (the ramp speed must be
avoided crossing at D
chosen so minimize population transfer from the state with
l
4). As in the case of s-wave scatter-
ing only [39], the time-dependent ﬁeld sequence has to be op-
timized to obtain maximal population transfer. The proposed
scheme promises to provide an efﬁcient means for the transfer
of population between states with different angular momenta
and for quantum state engineering.

Figure 2 illustrates that the pseudo-potential treatment re-
produces the eigenenergies of the shape-dependent model po-
tential Vmodel. To further assess the validity of the pseudo-
potential treatment, we now consider two interacting bosonic
dipoles for which the dipolar interaction is dominant, i.e., we
consider a00 = 0. For Vmodel with b = 0.0031aho, we deter-
mine a set of D
values at which a00 = 0. Note that the num-
ber of bound states with predominantly s-wave character in-
creases by one for each successively larger D

dating the applicability of the pseudo-potential treatment. The

agreement becomes less good, however, as D
can be explained readily by realizing that the dipole length D
approaches the harmonic oscillator length aho.

regime of the regularized zero-range pseudo-potential can be
extended signiﬁcantly by introducing energy-dependent scat-
tering lengths. Since the proper treatment of resonant inter-
actions within the regularized zero-range pseudo-potential re-
quires that the energy-dependence of the generalized scatter-

IV. SUMMARY

This paper applies a zero-range pseudo-potential treatment
to describe two interacting dipoles under external spherically
harmonic conﬁnement. Section II introduces the regular-
ized zero-range pseudo-potential Vpp,reg used in this work,
which was ﬁrst proposed by Derevianko [33, 34]. Particu-
lar emphasis is put on developing a simple interpretation of
the individual pieces of the pseudo-potential. Furthermore,
we clearly establish the connection between Vpp,reg and the
pseudo-potential Vpp, which is typically employed within a
mean-ﬁeld framework. We argue that the applicability regime
of these two pseudo-potentials is comparable if the scattering
strengths of Vpp,reg, calculated in the ﬁrst Born approximation,
are chosen so as to reproduce those of Vpp.

We then use the regularized zero-range pseudo-potential to
derive an implicit eigen equation for two dipoles under ex-
ternal conﬁnement, a system which can be realized experi-
mentally with the aid of optical lattices. In deriving the im-
plicit eigenequation, we again put emphasis on a detailed
understanding of how the solution arises, thus developing a
greater understanding of the underlying physics. The im-
plicit eigenequation can be solved straightforwardly, and al-
lows for a direct classiﬁcation scheme of the resulting eigen-
spectrum. By additionally calculating the eigen energies for
two dipoles interacting through a ﬁnite range model poten-

tial numerically, we assess the applicability of the developed
zero-range pseudo-potential treatment. We ﬁnd good agree-
and
ment between the two sets of eigenenergies for small D
quantify the deviations as D
increases. Finally, we show that
the validity regime of Vpp,reg can be extended by parametriz-
ing the scattering strengths of Vpp,reg in terms of the energy-
dependent K-matrix calculated for a realistic model potential.
This may prove useful also when describing resonantly inter-
acting dipoles.

At ﬁrst sight

it may seem counterintuitive to replace
the long-range dipolar interaction by a zero-range pseudo-
potential. However, if the length scales of the interaction po-
tential, i.e., the van der Waals length scale characterizing the
short-range part and the dipole length characterizing the long-
range part of the potential, are smaller than the characteristic
length of the trap aho, this approach is justiﬁed since the zero-
range pseudo-potential is designed to reproduce the K-matrix
elements of the “true” interaction potential. This is particu-
larly true if the pseudo-potential is taken to contain inﬁnitely
many terms, as done in this work.

In summary, this paper determines the eigenenergies of two
interacting dipoles with projection quantum number m = 0.
The applied zero-range pseudo-potential treatment is vali-
dated by comparing the resulting eigenenergies with those
obtained numerically for a shape-dependent model potential.
The analysis presented sheds further light on the intricate
properties of angle-dependent scattering processes and their
description through a regularized zero-range pseudo-potential
with inﬁnitely many terms. The calculated energy spectrum
may aid on-going experiments on dipolar Bose and Fermi
gases.

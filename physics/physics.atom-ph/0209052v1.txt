A quantum mechanical close coupling theory of spin relaxation in the stretched F = 2, MF = 2,

hyperﬁne level of sodium is presented. We calculate the dipolar relaxation rate of magnetically

trapped cold sodium atoms in the magnetic ﬁeld range 0 < B < 4 Tesla. The inﬂuence of shape

resonances and the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction on the collision dynamics are explored.

We examine the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections on the choice of asymptotic atomic state

INTRODUCTION

Advances in the cooling and trapping of atoms have greatly facilitated the exploration

of quantum degenerate matter [1]. The realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)

[2, 3, 4, 5] in atomic vapors validates the standard theory [6] for non-interacting and weakly

interacting systems, but recent experiments [7, 8, 9] demonstrate that atomic interactions,

though weak in an ensemble of atoms in the gas phase, lead to interesting phenomena that

are not present in the ideal gas system. Atomic interactions make it possible to ”tune”, via

Feshbach [10, 11] resonances, the characteristics and stability of a BEC. A full understanding

of the role of inelastic atomic collisions in a BEC that is undergoing collapse is incomplete

and the subject has attracted recent attention [12, 13, 14].

In a dilute, cold, gas, atoms interact primarily via long range dispersion and exchange

forces. However, inelastic processes are driven by spin exchange [15] and dipolar interactions

[16]. The latter process does not conserve total, atom pair, spin angular momentum and it

is a primary mechanism by which atoms, having hyperﬁne structure, can suﬀer an inelastic

transition. Dipolar relaxation determines the lifetime of the hydrogen atom BEC [17],

contributes to heating and inﬂuences the operation of atomic clocks [18] . Rates for dipolar

relaxation have been measured in 7Li [19], Cs [20], 85Rb [13], H [17] and Cr [21]. The rates

are generally small, typically having values that range 10−

14

10−

16 cm3s−

1, but in the cases

−

of Cs and Cr anomalously large values have been reported [20, 21]. Calculations for dipolar

relaxation rates, in the zero temperature limit, of several species have also been reported

[16, 22, 23, 24].

New magnetic trapping and buﬀer gas cooling schemes [25] create the opportunity to

study a host of atomic and molecular species that are not amenable to laser cooling tech-

nology. In a typical loading scheme, species with large magnetic moments are trapped by

external ﬁelds at relatively high temperatures, on the order of 1 K, before they are cooled

into the sub-Kelvin regime. In order to model this process one needs a detailed understand-

ing of the collision processes that can lead to trap loss and heating. To that end, we present a

comprehensive quantum mechanical theory of dipolar relaxation in alkali atoms. The theory

is suited for application in gases at temperatures where many partial waves in the collision

wave function contribute, and is applicable at arbitrary external magnetic ﬁeld intensity.

We apply the theory to calculate the dipolar relaxation rate of the stretched hyperﬁne level

2

in the 23Na(3s) atom and, in this paper, present results for the T

0 limit at magnetic

→

ﬁeld intensities in the range 0 < B < 4 Tesla. The results of our calculation are compared

to previous theoretical predictions[22, 24].

In a companion paper to this report, we will

present results for the calculated relaxation rates at higher temperatures. Here, we oﬀer a

detailed description of the collision theory and explore the consequences of anisotropy on

the collision dynamics. We point out the importance of shape resonances and their inﬂuence

on the value of the inelastic rate. We identify a feature in the cross section that corresponds

to the presence of an above threshold resonance, or a virtual state, in the l = 2 partial wave

of the scattering amplitude.

In section I we provide an introduction to the theoretical formalism that is applied in the

calculations. A detailed discussion of the close coupling equations, asymptotic boundary

conditions and symmetry requirements is given in sections II, and III. In section IV we

present the results of our calculations, and provide a detailed analysis of these results.

Unless it is otherwise stated, atomic units are used throughout the discussion.

II. CHANNEL BASIS

We consider two sodium atoms in their F = 2, MF = 2 hyperﬁne level, the maxi-

mal stretched state.

In Table I we itemize two-atom hyperﬁne levels with the notation

F MF fafb >, where F is the total angular momentum of the two atoms, MF the azimuthal

|
projection of that angular momentum, and fa, fb are the total angular momenta for atoms a

and b respectively. The states listed can mix, through dipolar and spin exchange interactions,

with the maximal stretched state during a collision.

Dipolar interaction selection rules(discussed in the sections below), allow a change in the

azimuthal quantum number ∆MF = 2, 1 and thus the states itemized in Table I must be

included in the close coupling expansion. States within a given MF manifold can undergo

spin-exchange transitions. In Table I we also list the basis

famafbmb > in which the individ-

|

ual atom azimuthal angular momenta are good quantum numbers. The basis

SMSIMI >

|

diagonalizes the asymptotic hamiltonian if the hyperﬁne interaction can be neglected, i.e. at

large magnetic ﬁeld strengths. Here, S, MS are the total two-atom spin angular momentum

quantum numbers, and I, MI the nuclear angular momentum quantum numbers. Allowed
values for 23Na2 are S = 1, 0 and I = 3, 2, 1, 0. In the close coupling expansion involving

molecular channel states we keep the notation that is appropriate for the asymptotic re-

gion to itemize the states in the expansion. For example, we deﬁne molecular channel basis

The molecular channel basis merge to the correct asymptotic basis at large inter-nuclear

separation. The states

F MF fafb > are then deﬁned by the linear combination of the BO

channel states given above,

where the coeﬃcients < MIIMSS

F MF fafb > are standard recoupling coeﬃcients appropri-

ate for the asymptotic basis. In this way we insure the molecular close coupling expansion

accounts for the asymptotic hyperﬁne interaction within each atom. In the case of a homonu-

clear system, the basis

In a non-zero magnetic ﬁeld, the asymptotic hamiltonian is not diagonal in the represen-

tation deﬁned by the basis vectors introduced above. In addition to asymptotic hyperﬁne

interactions, each atom experiences the Zeeman interaction. In that case, a linear combina-

tion of the basis states deﬁned above must be found so that the asymptotic hamiltonian is

diagonal in the new representation. We express these states using the notation

MF p ǫi >,

|

where MF is the total angular momentum along the direction ﬁxed by the magnetic ﬁeld,

p is an inversion parity quantum number, and ǫi is the asymptotic energy level eigenvalue.

We discuss the construction of that basis in the sections below.

In Fig. 1 we illustrate the hyperﬁne level structure of the 23Na atom and in Figs. 2a,2b we

show the energy spectrum of the asymptotic hamiltonian for the Na2 system, as a function

of magnetic ﬁeld strength.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Fig. 3 we plot the total rate coeﬃcient(solid line), in the T

0 limit, as a function

of magnetic ﬁeld strength.

In Fig. 3 we notice that the total relaxation rate is nearly

constant for ﬁeld strengths up to about 100 Gauss(G). In the range 100 G < B < 400 G

FIG. 3: Total dipolar relaxation rate (heavy solid line) as a function of external magnetic

ﬁeld strength. The dashed lines corresponds to the approximation where the hyperﬁne basis

F MF fafb > is used for the asymptotic channel states. The dotted line corresponds to the case
|
where the

SMS IMi > basis is used and the hyperﬁne interaction is ignored.
|

the rates exhibit signiﬁcant structure. For larger values of B the total rate diminishes in

a monotonic manner. In ﬁgure 3 we also plot, shown by the dashed line, results obtained

using the approximation where the hyperﬁne states

F MF fafb > deﬁne the asymptotic basis

states and the asymptotic oﬀ-diagonal terms, due to magnetic interactions, are neglected.

For small B the approximation gives excellent agreement, for the total dipolar loss rate,

with the results obtained using the appropriate

MF p ǫ > basis. However, for B > 60 G this

|

|

approximation considerably overestimates the total rate.

The dotted line in the ﬁgure presents the results of the calculation when we used the

SMSIMI > representation to deﬁne the asymptotic channel basis, and where we ignored

|
the hyperﬁne hamiltonian. For small B this approximation is poor because it neglects the

dominant hyperﬁne interaction. In the B

0 limit, rates obtained in this approximation

vanish due to the nature of the anisotropic dipolar interaction. According to the selection

rules discussed in the previous sections, a pair of atoms approaching as an s-wave must exit

as a d-wave, and therefore, the exit channel must be exothermic with respect to the entrance

channel for the collision to proceed in the zero temperature limit. At B

0 a ﬁnite energy

→

defect is generated by the hyperﬁne interaction and, if hyperﬁne eﬀects are ignored, the

→

15

dipolar rate vanishes in the T

0, limit. This eﬀect is clearly evident in Fig. 3. As B

→ ∞
the neglect of the hyperﬁne interaction is justiﬁed and, in that case, we expect that the rate

→

obtained using the

SMSIMI > basis to be a good approximation. In Fig. 3 we note that

|

for B > 1 T the dotted line merges with the solid line and illustrates the validity of that

approximation at large ﬁeld strengths.

In Figs 4a and 4b we present the results of our calculations for the partial rate coeﬃcients

for the states itemized in Table II. We note that the

signiﬁcantly from rates obtained in the

MF p ǫ > basis. Figs. 4a, 4b also show signiﬁcant

|

structure in the partial rates that correspond to the

MF = 3; ǫ1 >,

MF = 2; ǫ1 > states. In

|

|

order to explore the origin of these structures we plot, in Fig. 5, the partial rates obtained

in the

SMSIMI > representation as functions of ﬁeld strength. The dashed line denotes

|

the partial rate into the state where both atoms ﬂip their total electronic spin, whereas the

solid line corresponds to the case where only one atom ﬂips its spin (see also Fig 2b.). We

ﬁrst consider the kinematics of the latter case.

In the

SMSIMI > basis the Zeeman energy splitting between the

S = 1; MS = 1; I =

|

3; MI > and the

S = 1; MS = 0; I = 3; MI > exit channel is given by

where k is the wavenumber that corresponds to the kinetic energy of the system in the

entrance channel and B is the absolute value of the magnetic ﬁeld that is parallel to the

laboratory z-axis. In the k

0 limit the exit channel is a d-wave and, using the potential

for the 3Σu state of 23Na2 system tabulated by Samuelis et al. [28], we ﬁnd that the l = 2

splitting with the barrier height and ﬁnd that the critical magnetic ﬁeld strength required

so enough kinetic energy is available in the exit channel to overcome the barrier has the

value Bc = 39.0 G.

According to Fig. 5, at this ﬁeld strength the relaxation rate is rapidly increasing,

as B increases, but it is in a region to the left of its maximum which occurs at Bmax =

46.0 G. Therefore, the pronounced structure seen in this rate cannot be solely attributed

structure, evident in the in Fig. 5, is a consequence of shape resonance phenomena. This

conclusion is strengthened by studies of this collision process at higher temperatures [29],

The largest uncertainty is probably associated with the choice for molecular potentials of

the ground 23Na system. We adopted the most recent, and accurate, potentials tabulated

High precision measurement of the static dipole polarizability of cesium

(Dated: February 21, 2014)
The cesium 62S1/2 scalar dipole polarizability a 0 has been determined from the time-of-ﬂight of laser cooled
and launched cesium atoms traveling through an electric ﬁeld. We ﬁnd a 0 = 6.611 ± 0.009 × 10−39 Cm2/V =
59.42 ± 0.08 × 10−24 cm3 = 401.0 ± 0.6 a3
0. The 0.14% uncertainty is a factor of fourteen improvement over
the previous measurement. Values for the 62P1/2 and 62P3/2 lifetimes and the 62S1/2 cesium-cesium dispersion
coefﬁcient C6 are determined from a 0 using the procedure of Derevianko and Porsev [Phys. Rev. A 65, 053403
(2002)].

The static polarizability quantiﬁes the effect of one of the
simplest perturbations to an atom: the application of a static
electric ﬁeld inducing a dipole moment [1, 2]. With increas-
ing atomic number, relativistic effects [3, 4] and core electron
contributions [5, 6] to the alkali polarizabilities become in-
creasingly signiﬁcant. In cesium, the heaviest stable alkali,
the relativistic effects reduce the polarizability by 16% and
the core contributes 4%. However, experimental uncertainties
have made the measurements of the alkali polarizabilities rel-
atively insensitive to the smaller core contribution, as shown
in Fig 1. With the largest relativistic correction and core con-
tribution of the stable alkali atoms, the cesium polarizability
is an ideal benchmark for testing the theoretical treatment of
both relativistic effects and core contributions. Our measure-
ment advances the accuracy of the cesium polarizability by
a factor of fourteen over the previous measurement [7] and
places the uncertainty at 4% of the core contribution.

To our measurement’s level of accuracy, the hyperﬁne lev-
els of the cesium ground state have a common polarizability
a 0. From angular momentum relations [9], the dependencies
of the polarizability on the hyperﬁne level F and on the mag-

netic sublevel MF are greatly suppressed in the cesium ground
state. The small remaining dependencies, generated by the hy-
perﬁne interaction, have been measured in Refs. [10, 11, 12].
For a static electric ﬁeld E of moderate strength, the poten-
tial energy W of a neutral cesium atom in that ﬁeld may be
written in terms of a 0 as W = −(1/2)a 0E 2. All odd terms in
E are disallowed by parity conservation and the linear term,
also forbidden by time-reversal invariance, is experimentally
known to be less than 1.6 × 10−44 C-m in cesium [13]. The
hyperpolarizability contribution, which scales as E 4, has been
calculated [14, 15] and is negligible at the ﬁelds used for our
measurement.

Prior to the interferometric measurement of Ekstrom et. al.
[8], the most accurate determinations of the alkali polarizabil-
ities [7, 16] had been made by measuring the deﬂection of a
thermal beam due to a transverse electric ﬁeld gradient. The
gradient generates a force F = −(cid:209) W = a 0E(cid:209) E where E is
the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld. The deﬂection of a thermal
beam is small because the interaction time is short.

For cesium, we have measured instead the effect of an elec-
tric ﬁeld gradient on the longitudinal velocity of a slow beam
(< 2 m/s) of neutral cesium atoms afforded by an optically
launched atomic fountain. Upon entering an electric ﬁeld
from a region of zero ﬁeld, the kinetic energy of the atoms
gain energy by the amount −W , producing a noticeable in-
crease in the atoms’ velocity for even moderate electric ﬁelds.
Because the force is conservative, the ﬁnal velocity is depen-
dent on only the ﬁnal magnitude of the electric ﬁeld and not
on the details of the gradient in the region of transition from
zero ﬁeld.

In our measurement, cesium atoms are launched vertically
from a magneto optic trap (MOT) such that the atoms reach
their zenith between a set of parallel electric ﬁeld plates
(Fig. 2). When the electric ﬁeld is turned on, the neutral ce-
sium atoms accelerate into the plates with a resulting higher
trajectory and a correspondingly longer ﬂight time (Fig. 3).
The kinetic energy boost afforded the atoms by the electric
ﬁeld is then determined from the increase in round trip time.
The atoms are detected by laser-induced ﬂuorescence just
before they enter the electric ﬁeld plates and again when they
fall back out. The intensity of the ﬂuorescence is recorded
against time as a measure of the cesium packet density proﬁle.
The height of the laser probe was determined to within 0.1 mm

reduces defocusing effects [17], while the larger gaps at the ends are
to provide a weaker ﬁeld for other experiments.

with respect to the ﬁeld plates using reference features ﬁxed
to the electric ﬁeld plate assembly and surveyed as part of the
measurement of the electric ﬁeld plate gap as discussed below.
Because the laser ﬂuorescence is destructive, the laser beam
was shuttered to allow detection of the atoms either when they
are rising or when they are falling.

The electric ﬁeld plates were machined from aluminum
with the high-ﬁeld surfaces tungsten-coated for sputter resis-
tance. The gap between the electric ﬁeld plates (3.979 mm
average) was measured to a precision of ±1 µm (dominated
by shot noise) along its length and width by proﬁling the in-
terior surfaces with a 5-axis coordinate measuring machine
(Fanamation model 606040). A calibration correction of
−10.9 ± 0.3 µm was determined by proﬁling a set of preci-
sion gaps constructed of sandwiched gauge blocks. Varia-
tions of 4 µm across the width of the plates were averaged

with a weighting factor favoring the midline of the plates,
where the atoms spend the greatest portion of the round trip.
The resulting electric ﬁelds were calculated for the full length
of the plates using a two-dimensional ﬁnite-element code.
The voltages applied to the electric ﬁeld plates were continu-
ously measured by two NIST-traceable voltage dividers (Ross
model VD30-8.3-BD-LD-A) and a load matched multimeter
(HP3457A).

A single measurement of the polarizability consisted of
recording the intensity versus time of the ﬂuorescence signals
from two rising and two falling cesium atom packets in zero
electric ﬁeld, followed by ﬁve falling packets with the electric
ﬁeld on. The polarizability required to generate the delay in
the falling cesium packet with the electric ﬁeld on was deter-
mined by integrating the equations of motion over the path of
the packet. The local value for gravity (979.92 ± 0.03 cm/s)
was interpolated from the local gravity measurements in Ref.
[18].

The resulting polarizabilities were corrected for the longi-
tudinal velocity spread of the cesium packet. To minimize
this correction, we used a version of the pulsed electric-ﬁeld
technique presented in Ref. [17] to reduce the longitudinal ve-
locity spread of the cesium packet shortly after launch from
3.2 cm/s RMS to 0.8 cm/s. The reduction in the velocity
spread also serves to decrease the time width of the ﬂuores-
cence signal when detecting the cesium packet and conse-
quently increase our time resolution. The corrections for the
velocity width are ﬁeld dependent and are shown in Fig. 4.
The average correction is -0.07%.

Non-uniform losses across the longitudinal width of the
packet distort the shape of the ﬂuorescence signal. Numeri-
cal evolution of the longitudinal and transverse phase-space of
the packet through the apparatus, taking into account sources
of defocusing and clipping, generated the non-uniform loss
corrections to the polarizability shown in Fig. 4. The average
correction was -0.05%.

The data, totaling 105 measurements of a 0, was taken in
three runs and over electric ﬁelds of 3 MV/m to 8 MV/m
The ﬁnal result is a 0(Cs) = 6.611 ± 0.009 ×

polarizability is plotted in Fig. 6 along with those from previ-
ous measurements and from recent calculations.

62P3/2 lifetimes from the dispersion coefﬁcient C6 by Dere-
vianko and Porsev [19] demonstrates the intimate connection
between these quantities. Reversing their procedure, we ex-
tract from our value of a 0 the contribution of the 62P1/2 and
62P3/2 states to the ground state polarizability. These two
states account for 96% of a 0. With the ratio of dipole ma-
trix elements measured in Ref. [24], we obtain the absolute
value of the 62S1/2 to 62P1/2 and 62S1/2 to 62P3/2 reduced
dipole matrix elements |D1/2| = (3.824 ± 0.003 ± 0.001) ×
10−29 Cm = 4.510 ± 0.004 ± 0.001 a.u. and |D3/2| = (5.381 ±

spectively, where the reduced dipole matrix elements are de-
ﬁned according to the Wigner-Eckart theorem formulated with
3-J symbols [25]. The deﬁnitions for atomic units (a.u.) are
given in Ref. [25]. The ﬁrst uncertainty in our values is
from the uncertainty in a 0 and the second is from the un-

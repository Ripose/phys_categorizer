Abstract

Nonrelativistically forbidden, single-photon transition rates between low ly-
ing states of the helium atom are rigorously derived within quantum elec-
trodynamics theory. Equivalence of velocity and length gauges, including
relativistic corrections is explicitly demonstrated. Numerical calculations of
matrix elements are performed with the use of high precision variational wave
functions and compared to former results.

The existence of nonrelativistically forbidden transitions in helium, for example between
the singlet and triplet states, indicates the presence of relativistic eﬀects. The calculation
of these eﬀects in atoms or ions is a highly nontrivial task. Depending on the magnitude
of nuclear charge Z one performs various approximations. Here we study light atoms, so
the expansion in the small parameter Z α is the most appropriate. Forbidden transitions
have already been studied for many light atoms and especially for helium (for a review see
[1]). Historically, the ﬁrst but approximate calculations of S-P forbidden transitions were
performed by Elton in [2]. Since the dominant part comes from 23P1 and 21P1 mixing, he
included in the calculation only these states. Drake and Dalgarno in [3] were the ﬁrst to
include higher excited states, which led to much higher precision. Moreover, Drake later
[4] accounted for corrections to S-state wave functions. Although these calculations were
correct, there was no proof that they are complete. As an example may serve the 23S1 −11S0
M1 transition. Feinberg and Sucher [5] derived an eﬀective operator for this transition and
showed the cancellation of electron-electron terms. However, the calculations of Drake in
[6] were performed earlier with the implicit assumption, that these terms are absent. In a
completely diﬀerent approach based on relativistic many body perturbation theory Johnson
et al. [1] and Derevianko et al [7] studied forbidden transition in both velocity and length
gauge. They pointed out the signiﬁcance of negative energy states. However, not all results
were in agreement with the nonrelativistic approach based on the Breit hamiltonian. It is
the purpose of this work to systematically derive matrix elements for forbidden transitions
in helium within quantum electrodynamics theory. The equivalence of length and velocity
gauges for E1 transitions, including relativistic corrections, is explicitly shown. With the
use of optimized numerical wave functions, the amplitudes and transition probabilities for
23P2 − 11S0, 23P1 − 11S0, 21P1 − 23S1, 23S1 − 11S0, and 33S1 − 23S1 are calculated with high
precision and compared to former results.

The nonrelativistic helium atom interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is described

by the Schr¨odinger-Pauli hamiltonian:

In the eﬀective Hamiltonian approach relativistic corrections enter in two ways, as corrections
to the wave functions φ and ψ and the correction δ~ to the current ~p/m

Corrections to the current are given by several time ordered diagrams, shown in Fig. 1. The
corresponding expression is calculated as follows. The ﬁrst diagram is

where u(p) is a normalized plane wave solution of the free Dirac equation. For considered
transitions one may leave spin dependent terms only. In position representation it takes a
form

The photon momentum k is of order m (Z α)2, while r is of order (m Z α)−1. This means
that ei ~k·~r can be expanded in powers of ~k · ~r. After adding contributions from both electrons
the (Z α)2 correction takes the form

The remaining diagrams involve electron-electron terms. The last two are of higher order,
so they will not be considered here. The expression for diagram 3 can be obtained from
Eq.(9) by the replacements −Z α → α. In this way one obtains

and cancels out with that from diagram 3, Eq. (12). The ﬁnal expression for the relativistic
correction to the current of order O(Z α)2 is the sum of (8) and (10)

δ~ =

This δj could be also derived through the Fouldy-Wouythusen transformation of αi ei ~k·~r,
however in this way possible electron-electron terms are omitted, which happens to be correct
for just this case. Having δj and δH, the transition amplitude T i in (4) will be transformed
to the length gauge with the use of identity

~p1 + ~p2

= i [H, ~r1 + ~r2]

and the fact the terms in T i proportional to ki do not contribute to the transition rate, as
it can be seen from Eq. (3). After performing simple algebraic transformations the result is

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (18) corresponds to electric dipole, and the second one to magnetic
quadrupole transitions. It is worth noting that for electric dipole transitions, as given in
length gauge, relativistic corrections enter only through corrections to the hamiltonian δH.
So far, we have considered only forbidden transitions with spin change between S and P
states, namely 23P2 → 11S0, 23P1 → 11S0 and 21P1 → 23S1. However, even more forbidden
M1 transitions 23S1 → 11S0 and 33S1 → 23S1 arrive at the order O(Z α)3, so they are not
described by the expression in Eq. (16). No second order type of terms contribute and in
the calculation of δjM one takes the next corresponding term in the expansion of ei ~k·~r in
Eqs.(6,9,12,16)

This result agrees with the former one, obtained by Feinberg and Sucher in [5]. For M1
transition between 23S1 and 11S0 it could be further simpliﬁed to

We now consider the spin algebra in the calculation of the transition probability, as given
by Eqs. (3) and (18). One summs up over ﬁnal states and averages out over initial states.

where k = |∆E|, and hi is deﬁned by Eq. (5). It is worth noting that 1P1 → 3S1 is not only
E1 transition but also M2, which has not yet been recognized in the literature.

Once transition probabilities are expressed in terms of matrix elements between non-
relativistic wave functions, they can be calculated numerically with high precision. In the
numerical calculation we follow an approach developed by Korobov [8]. The wave function
is expressed in terms of exponentials

φS =

ci[e−αi r1−βi r2−γi r ∓ (r1 ↔ r2)] ,

~φP =

ci[~r1 e−αi r1−βi r2−γi r ∓ (r1 ↔ r2)] ,

of this basis set was 600. Lower values were used for checking convergence. The advantage
of this basis set is simplicity of matrix elements, which are expressed in terms of integral

For some more singular matrix elements an additional integral with respect to corresponding
parameters has to be performed. The disadvantage of this basis set is the necessity of using
quadruple precision for N > 100. Moreover, the second order terms require more careful
tuning of parameters due to the singularity of δH and large mixing of 23P1 and 21P1 states.
These, which involve odd parity intermediate P -states, are much larger than those which
involve even parity P -states, by approximately three orders of magnitude. It is due to the
fact that energies of even parity P states lie beyond the ionization level. Most often, these
small second order terms were neglected in the former calculations. However, they are not
neglected here. Our numerical results for forbidden transitions between low lying states are
presented in Table I.

In the comparison with former work we start with the M1 transition 23S1 → 11S0. This
transition was measured by Moos and Woodworth in [9] with the result A = 1.10(33) 10−4 s−1
and Gordon Berry from Notre Dame is currently preparing a more precise measurement.
The ﬁrst (correct) theoretical result obtained by Drake in [6] 1.272 · 10−4 s−1 is in agreement
with the experimental value. However, as pointed out by Feinberg and Sucher in [5], Drake
has not considered electron-electron terms, which happened to cancel out for this transition.
Later, Johnson et al [1] used RMBPT to calculate forbidden transitions for any helium-like
ions and obtained a result for Z = 2, which is 1.266 · 10−4 s−1.
It diﬀers slightly from
the result obtained here 1.272426 · 10−4 s−1, due to inclusion in [1] of some higher order
terms, while electron correlations were not well accounted for. Moreover there are unknown
radiative corrections and exchange type of diagrams of order α/(2 π), the last two in Fig.
(1), to any of these transitions. Therefore only ﬁrst 3 digits are physically signiﬁcant.
Numerical results are presented with higher precision for the purpose of comparison with
former results. Next the M1 transition 33S1 → 23S1 rate was obtained only by Derevianko
et al in [7]. Their result 1.17 10−8 s−1, disagrees with ours, 6.484690 10−9 s−1. The reason of
this discrepancy is left unexplained. It may indicate the loss of accuracy of RMBPT due to
strong numerical cancellation. This discrepancy does not have experimental impact since
this rate is too small for Z = 2 to be measured. However, calculations should be veriﬁed for
higher Z, where this transition rate grows with Z 10 and becomes measurable at some value
of Z. The next considered transition is M2: 23P2 → 11S0. It was ﬁrst obtained by Drake [4]:
A = 0.327 s−1, and later by Johnson et al [1] A = 0.3271 s−1, in agreement with our result
A = 0.3270326 s−1. The calculation of the intercombination E1 transition 23P1 → 11S0
was little more elaborate, since it involves inﬁnite summation over intermediate states. In
former works the second term in Eq. (37) involving even parity P-states was neglected.
Indeed, calculations show it is smaller than 1%. The ﬁrst complete result by Drake [4] is
A = 176.4 s−1. RMBPT calculations of Johnson et al [1] including negative energy states
is A = 175.7 s−1 and our result A = 177.5771 s−1 agrees within 1%. The last transition
21P1 → 23S1 is a sum of E1 and M2. The result A = 1.55 s−1 obtained by Drake includes
only E1 transition. Our result is A = 1.548945 s−1 and the magnetic transition happened to
be negligible 0.000019 due to small energy splitting.

In summary, we have presented a rigorous derivation of rates for nonrelativistically for-
bidden transitions. We demonstrated equivalence of length and velocity gauges including
relativistic correction for forbidden transitions. We conﬁrmed the commonly used fact that
in the length gauge relativistic corrections enters only through corrections to wave function
as given by Breit hamiltonian. We veriﬁed that M2 21P1 → 23S1 transition is much smaller
than E1, which was implicitly assumed in former works. Our numerical calculations using
simple exponential functions conﬁrmed former results with the exception of 33S1 → 23S1
transition, where our result is approximately twice smaller than of [7].

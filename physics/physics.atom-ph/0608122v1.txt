In present paper we develop an analytic theory for the harmonic generation of symmetric diatomic
molecular ions beyond two-level model, emphasizing the inﬂuence of charge-resonance (CR) states
those are strongly coupled to electromagnetic ﬁelds for large internuclear distance. With taking
into account the continuum states that is ignored in the two-level model and become important
for intense laser case, our model is capable to produce spectrum for the whole range of harmonic
orders consisting of a molecular plateau due to the CR transition and an atomic-like plateau for a
long-wavelength excitation, and in good agreement with numerical results from directly solution of
the Schr¨odinger equation. Our theory also identiﬁes the crucial role of the CR states in the ﬁne
structure of harmonic spectrum and shows that the harmonic generation in molecular system can
be eﬀectively controlled by adjusting the internuclear distance.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, high order harmonic generation
(HOHG) from atom and molecule has been the subject
of numerous experimental and theoretical studies, mainly
because the emission of high-order harmonics is a promis-
ing method to produce coherent x rays and attosecond
pulses, and an eﬀective ways to study the internal con-
struction of atom or molecule[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

Compared to atom case, the HOHG spectrum of
molecule systems demonstrates novel properties, e.g.,
peak splitting and sideband peaks, Rabi or Mollow
triplets eﬀect, and combination of the atomic-like and
molecular-like plateau, molecular alignment eﬀect, and
two-center interference, to name only a few[23, 24, 25,
26]. Symmetric molecular system such as H +
2 have pairs
of electronic states known as the charge-resonance (CR)
states, (i.e.,1σg,1σµ.)
It is known that the CR states
are strongly coupled to electromagnetic ﬁelds at large in-
ternuclear separation R. Bandrauk and co-worker ﬁrst
pointed out the importance of these CR states as sources
of highly nonlinear laser-induced eﬀects in molecules[23].
Ivanov, Corkum examined the possibility of using the
CR states to produce and coherently control HOHG[24].
Zuo, Chelkowski, and Bandrauk have showed that sym-
metric molecular ions in general produce more eﬃcient
harmonic generation than atoms, especially at large R,
due to these CR states[25, 26]. However, in the all above
discussions, the theoretical analysis is based on a two-
level model where the continuum (ionization) states are
ignored completely. Since the ground-continuum cou-
pling and ionization become important for the strong
laser ﬁelds of 1014W/cm2 and above, a fully understand-
ing of the whole structure of HOHG and the eﬀect of CR
states in molecule systems requires to extend to consider
the continuum states and ionization process.

In present paper we develop an analytic theory on the
harmonic generation of symmetric diatomic molecular
ions beyond the two-level model. Our model is capa-
ble to produce harmonic structure for the whole range
of harmonic order, including the molecular plateau due
to CR transition and the atomic-like plateau for a long-
wavelength excitation, and agrees well with the numer-
ical results from directly solving the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. Our theory identiﬁes the role of the CR states in
the ﬁne structure of harmonic spectrum and shows that
the harmonic generation in molecular system can be ef-
fectively controlled through CR states by adjusting the
internuclear distance.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II we present
our analytical theory. Our analysis is divided into two
cases: near-resonance region of intermediate internuclear
distance and the strong-coupling region of large internu-
clear distance. We will derive the time-dependent am-
plitudes of the ground, excited and continuum states,
then calculate dipolar moments and their Fourier trans-
formation. The analytic expressions of the amplitudes
of HOHG for the whole range of harmonic order is
given in this section. Sec.III presents our numerical re-
sults. Our theory is applied to 1D symmetric diatomic
molecule model, making analysis on the structure of
HOHG and compare with the results from directly solv-
ing Schr¨odinger equation. Sec.V is our conclusion.

II. ANALYTIC THEORY

We consider a diatomic molecule ion in single-electron
approximation under the inﬂuence of a linear polarized
laser ﬁeld A(t) = (E cos(ωt), 0, 0), where Eω is the abso-
lute amplitude of the external electric ﬁeld and ω is the
frequency of the external ﬁeld. The Hamiltonian of the

model molecule studied here is

H(t) = (p

A(t))2/2 + V (r),

−

where p is the canonical momentum and V (r) is the bind-
ing potential.

Under strong-ﬁeld conditions [27, 28], it is reasonable
and the
to assume that, (a) Except the ground state
ﬁrst excited state
, the contribution from other bound
i
states can be neglected;(b) The depletion of the ground
state and the ﬁrst excited state is small;(c) In the contin-
uum, the electron can be treated as a free particle moving
in the electric ﬁeld without considering Coulomb poten-
tial. Then, the time-dependent wave functions can be
expanded as

where
E0 is the ionization potential of the ground state,
a(t) is the ground-state amplitude, b(t) is the ﬁrst excited
state amplitude and cp(t) are the amplitudes of the corre-
sponding continuum states. While the ionization is weak,
by neglecting the depletion of the ground and the ﬁrst

lation of a(t) and b(t) can be obtained by a two-level ap-
proximation. We have factor out here free oscillations of
the ground-state amplitude by the bare frequency

.It also can be seen from (10), the Rabi oscillation of the
ground and ﬁrst excited state should not contribute to
the parity of integer harmonic, but induces the symmet-
rical splitting of odd harmonic. The splitting separations
around each odd harmonic all take the same value Q. If
Q/ω is integer of odd number, then the odd harmonic
sidebands should coincide at the even harmonic (2nω)
position, thus giving rise to radiation of even harmonics.

It can be seen from (10)-(13), no matter initially the
system being in the ground state or the ﬁrst excited state
or the coherent superposition state[21], the right-hand
side of (14) only includes odd harmonic with the sym-
metrical splitting of

±
It should be noted that the rotating-wave approxi-
1 and
mation is applicable only when (E1 −
the external ﬁeld is weak. However, in case of stronger
ﬁeld where tunnelling ionization is prominent, our model
at intermediate R is considered to be an approximative
approach. The splitting separation can also be calcu-
lated by the eﬀective Rabi frequency or quasienergies
of the Flock states of the system[25, 26, 30]. But for
some speciﬁc intermediate R, the molecule ions have rel-
ative high ionization rate in the presence of relative weak
ﬁeld and if the external ﬁeld frequency ω accords with
1, our model can give an adequate de-

in other words, when R

tings of the odd harmonics should converge towards even
harmonic[31]. However it can be showed that in this case
the amplitudes of all of even harmonic should be zero, so
at very large R, only odd harmonic can be produced.
The point can be made clearer by the latter analysis of
(16)-(19).

From above formulae, it is easy to prove that if initially

the contributions to even harmonics from (17) should be

that the intensity of even harmonics as a whole should
be weaker than that of odd one, to which the contri-

other, and should depend on the relative phase of the
ground and ﬁrst excited state. Since other contributions
to even harmonics from (16) and (19) are correlative to
n2 being odd, then their intensity also should de-

even harmonics coming from the large Rabi splittings of
the odd harmonics should get weaker and weaker and
disappear ﬁnally with the increasing R (seeing Fig.2 and
Fig.6(a)).

(5.2a.u., and 6a.u.) to large R (16a.u.), the wavelength
adopted is λ=800nm, accordingly ω = 0.05642a.u. and
the laser pulse contains 20 optical cycles. Numeri-
cally the above schr¨odinger equation can be solved by
operator-splitting method[22].

We begin the calculation by assuming the electron ini-
tially is in the ground state. But Ivanov et al show that
one should consider at least two wave packets excited to
the electronic surfaces in their program[32], which means
initially the system should be in the coherent superposi-
tion state[21]. So we also perform the calculations from
the coherent superposition state of the ground state and
the ﬁrst excited state with equally weighted populations.

When R = 5.2a.u., the ionization potential of ground

0.84085a.u.. The energy separation between
E1 =
E0 and E1 is
E = 0.05745a.u., which is in the near-
(one-photon)-resonance region. Fig.1 shows the spec-
trum from 1D time-dependent calculation for the model
molecule at R = 5.2a.u.. In Fig.1, each odd harmonic
peak is accompanied symmetrically by two strong side-
bands. The energy separations between the neighboring
sidebands all have the same value, which can be explained
in a dressed molecule state picture[33].

0.05642a.u., initially in the ground state:(a) two-level calcu-
lation;(b) 1D time-dependent exact calculation.

Comparison between Fig.1 (a) and Fig.1(c) shows that
while the external ﬁeld becomes stronger and although
the ground states and the ﬁrst excited state depletion
in Fig.1(c) is only 0.03, there is very large diﬀerence be-
tween 1D time-dependent exact calculation and two-level
calculation. So the continuum state eﬀects on spectrum
must be considered in this case. Otherwise, an obvious
characteristic, diﬀerent from atom, for the population of
molecule states is the strong-coupling of the ground state
and the ﬁrst excited state. It shows that it is necessary
and reasonable to consider the ﬁrst excited state eﬀect on
harmonic generation to explain the spectrum from sym-
metrical diatomic molecular ions.

verge towards even harmonics and their intensity should
become weaker and weaker. Again the calculation result
also shows the strong-coupling of the ground state and
the ﬁrst excited state.

the atomiclike cutoﬀs of the transfer harmonics; the arrows
in (b)and (d) show the symmetrical splitting around the 3th
harmonic, and the numbers above the arrows show the split-
ting separation.

B. Harmonic spectrum calculated from our model

Fig.3(a) and (c) show the HOHG spectra from the 1D
time-dependent calculation and the numerical calculation
of the formula (14) with R=5.2a.u. and assuming the
system initially being in the ground state. Fig.3(b) and
Fig. 3(d) show the ﬁne structure of Fig.1(a) and Fig.3(c),
respectively. The splitting separation is Q = 1.41w in
Fig.3(b) and 1.94w in Fig.3(d). The discrepancy is due
to invalidation of rotating-wave approximation in intense
ﬁeld. A plateau in low-order region is also identiﬁable in
the spectrum in Fig.3(c) with a cutoﬀ at the 5th har-
monic order, which agrees with Fig.3(a). This corre-
sponds to the maximum energy acquired by the electron
in the two-level system in the presence of the ﬁeld[26].
Furthermore, a second plateau up to the 25th harmonic
order which is associated with the ground-continuum
coupling (referred to as the atomic plateau) can be iden-
tiﬁed. The cutoﬀ position of the atomic plateau can be
well explained by a semiclassical model[28].

Fig.4 shows the HOHG spectra from 1D time-
dependent numerical calculation and (14) with R=6a.u.
E0 = 0.0304a.u. The total depletion of the
and E1 −
ground states and the ﬁrst excited state is 0.34. The
splitting separations is Q = 1.2ω in Fig.4(b) and 1.17ω

in Fig.4(d). The position of cutoﬀ in Fig.4(c) is at
the 24th harmonic order that agrees with the order
n = (3.17Up + Ip)/ω, the cutoﬀ law predicted by the
semiclassical mechanism of HOHG.

It is obvious that in the near reso-
nance case(Fig5(a)), good agreement is obtained while
the ﬁeld is weak. However while the ﬁeld becomes
stronger, the diﬀerence between the theory one and the
numerical one seems smaller in Fig5(b) than in Fig5(a)
with the same ﬁeld intensity.

Inﬂuence of initial condition and internuclear

distance

At intermediate R, such as R=5.2a.u. or R=6a.u., no
matter initially the system is in the ground state or the
ﬁrst excited state, or the coherent superposition state, no
distinct diﬀerence is found in the spectra from numerical
calculations. However at large R, the case is rather diﬀer-

Fig.6(b), where the system initially is in the coherent su-
perposition state, even harmonics appear although they
are weaker than the odd harmonics, however in Fig6(a),
where the system initially is in the ground state, even
harmonics hardly are distinguishable. The result vali-
dates our analysis for (20), which predicts that at large
R if the system initially is in the ground state, only odd
harmonic can be produced , and if it is in the coherent
superposition state, even harmonics also should be emit-
ted although their strength should be weaker than the
odd ones. If initially the system is in the excited state,
the case is analogous with the ground state. Other calcu-
lations at R=16a.u. from diﬀerent initial conditions also
show similar result. The position of cutoﬀ in Fig.6(c) is
at the 23th harmonic order, which agrees with the order
n = (3.17Up + Ip)/ω.

not completely degenerated. The position of cutoﬀ in
Fig.9(b) is at the 35th harmonic order, which agrees
with the order n = (5.33Up + Ip)/ω that is obtained by
the semiclassical calculation considering complex trajec-
tories. This is consistent with the ﬁnding that at very
large R, the molecule has diﬀerent cutoﬀ law [2, 13].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, with considering the continuum states
and ionization, the photon-emission spectra of the sym-
metric diatomic molecule ions in intense laser ﬁelds are
thoroughly investigated and the role of the CR states is
identiﬁed.

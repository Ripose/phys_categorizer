The full-dimensional time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the electronic dynamics of single-electron
systems in intense external ﬁelds is solved directly using a discrete method. Our approach combines the ﬁnite-
difference and Lagrange mesh methods. The method is applied to calculate the quasienergies and ionization
probabilities of atomic and molecular systems in intense static and dynamic electric ﬁelds. The gauge invariance
and accuracy of the method is established. Applications to multiphoton ionization of positronium and hydrogen
atoms and molecules are presented. At very high intensity above saturation threshold, we extend the method
using a scaling technique to estimate the quasienergies of metastable states of the hydrogen molecular ion. The
results are in good agreement with recent experiments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Matter exposed to intense laser ﬁelds has attracted exten-
sive research in the past two decades. Due to the competi-
tion between external forces induced by the laser ﬁeld and
Coulomb interactions, which bind the system together, the na-
ture of the metastable states that arise is strongly controlled by
the nature of the external ﬁeld and is not simply a feature of
the atomic or molecular system. In such circumstances the
internal and external ﬁelds are on an equal footing and not
separable.

The study of these effects in few-electron atoms have be-
come accessible recently both experimentally and theoreti-
cally because of advances in experimental techniques and
the availability of supercomputers. Compared with atoms,
molecules in intense laser ﬁelds are much more complicated
not only because of the multi-center nature of the problem
but also due to the additional vibrational and rotational de-
grees of freedom associated with the nuclei [1, 2]. In poly-
atomic systems, the energy transfer to collective motion leads
to extremely high-energy secondary photons, ions and elec-
trons [3, 4].

Standard perturbation theory is no longer applicable when
the forces induced by the applied laser ﬁeld are comparable
If the external ﬁeld is
to the binding forces of the system.
periodic then the system is metastable and has a well-deﬁned
quasienergy spectrum. Suppose the unperturbed ground-state
has a real energy Ei, then the effect of the external ﬁeld is
to produce an energy shift ∆ and decay width rate Γ/~, so
that the quasienergy has the usual form E = Ei + ∆
iΓ/2.
This describes a steady-state decay and can be treated very ef-
fectively with time-independent methods such as the Floquet
method. However, at the very highest intensities the transient
aperiodic effects of short duration pulses of dynamic ﬁelds
mean that the shift and rate are poorly deﬁned. Under these
conditions a time-dependent approach is essential.
In this
paper we describe such an approach applied to the regimes
where the quasienegy is well-deﬁned and to time-dependent
problems where this is not the case. We ﬁnd the method works
efﬁciently and accurately for both cases, and thus is well-
suited to the study of metastable states under all conditions.

Recent advances in experimental technology in the utilisation
of high intensity lasers have led to the creation and study of
short-lived atomic and molecular states. In this paper we ap-
ply the method to problems of this type, though the method
is of more general applicability. With very short pulses, not
only the laser envelope but even the phase of the ﬁeld can be
important [5]. Therefore, one has to directly integrate the full-
dimensional Schr¨odinger equation in order to describe accu-
rately the underlying physical mechanisms [6, 7, 8] and obtain
data relevant to experiments.

Although one-dimensional models have been routinely
used in describing atoms and molecules in strong laser
ﬁelds [9], ab initio full-dimensional quantum-mechanical
calculations are very important for exactly calculable few-
electron systems. As discussed in [9], the numerical results
for excitation, dissociation and ionization in simpliﬁed mod-
els are strongly sensitive to the parameters chosen. Full-
dimensionality calculations without approximation are really
necessary to establish accurate data as benchmarks to assess
the quality or regime of applicability of other calculations and
to produce results which are comparable with experimental
observations.

We have recently developed a very accurate and efﬁcient
numerical method to study metastable states in high inten-
sity ﬁelds. This was applied to the fragmentation of the hy-
drogen molecular ion in an intense laser ﬁeld beyond the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation [8, 10, 11]. In this paper,
we make a detailed investigation of this method applied to
metastable atomic and molecular systems. We discuss the
variational characteristics of this method and conﬁrm its ac-
curacy, convergence and gauge invariance. Results are com-
pared to other theoretical estimates of the metastable states,
and we compare with experimental results for the ionization
of the hydrogen molecular ion at high intensities.

is the direct solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation of an arbitrary one-electron systems in

strong external electric ﬁelds

and A(r, t) is the (external) vector potential; V (r, t) is the
(internal) scalar potential. An example of such a problem is
a one-electron molecular system in an intense laser ﬁeld; the
internal ﬁeld arising from the positively-charged nuclei.
In
order to simplify the model and to understand the electronic
dynamics in isolation, we consider the hydrogen molecular
ion with the nuclei ﬁxed in space. The nuclei, labelled 1 and
2, are a ﬁxed distance R apart, and have charges Z1 and Z2.
The origin of the coordinate r is located at the internuclear
midpoint, with the electronic Hamiltonian takes the form

Monochromatic light with linear polarization parallel to the
internuclear axis implies a cylindrical symmetry about this
axis. Associated with this symmetry is a good quantum num-
ber, Λ, proportional to the projection of angular momentum
along the axis. Thus the electron position can be completely
described by the radial, ρ, and axial, z, coordinates with re-
spect to an origin taken at the midpoint between the nuclei.
The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation reduces to a 2+1 di-

φijk. The method
as the array φ(ρ, z, t)
of discretization of the Hamilton divides the axial and radial
coordinates into subspaces. Two distinct but complementary
grid methods are used for the subspaces. The radial subspace
is discretized over a semi-inﬁnite range using a small number
Nρ of unevenly spaced points that are the nodes of global in-
terpolating functions that enter the Lagrange mesh technique.
This leads to a small dense matrix for the Hamiltonian in the
ρ-subspace. On the other hand the axial coordinate subspace
is represented by a large number of equally-spaced points that
are the mesh points of a ﬁnite-difference scheme. The asso-
ciated subspace Hamiltonian matrix is large but sparse. Our
approach is tailored to the requirements of accuracy and com-
putational efﬁciency.

For wavefunction character in the ρ-coordinate we have
found that a Lagrange mesh [8, 12] can provide a more ef-
ﬁcient discretization scheme compared with that provided by
ﬁnite-difference formulae. This type of grid can be chosen
to accommodate short-range singularities or long-range be-
haviour, and can be scaled in length or number of grid points
to improve accuracy with a modest number of points. We
rescale the radial variable as follows, ρ = hx where h is some

(vk)i,j = φ(hxi, zj, tk),

while the (il, jm)th element of the matrix Hk is deﬁned

so that the time evolution is described by the equation

Evaluation of this exponential is carried out using a Krylov
subspace decomposition [7, 8]. Using the Arnoldi al-
gorithm [14] we construct an orthonormal set of vectors,
q0, q1, q2, . . . , qna

tain the matrix equation

where Qk is a matrix formed from the na column vectors

khkQk can be used as a replacement to Hk in a wide variety
of applications. In particular the time-evolution operator can
be written as

˜Hk∆t = Qke−ihk∆tQ†
k.

(37)

Now hk is typically a tridiagonal matrix and so e−ihk∆t can
be computed inexpensively. Thus ˜U(tk + ∆t, tk) is in effect
a unitary propagator correct to order (∆t)na .

III. ACCURACY OF THE DISCRETE SOLUTIONS

The results we obtain from this method depend on several
parameters, namely Nρ, hρ, ∆z, zmax, na, ∆t, and the choice
of gauge used to describe the laser-molecule interaction term.
In this section we detail the choices for these parameters re-
quired to obtain accurate and fully converged solutions.

A. Spatial grid parameters

≤

hρ ≤

In an intense ﬁeld problem, the dynamics of the system can
be very sensitive to the initial state. Therefore, the accuracy
of the ground state wavefunction and its corresponding energy
play a crucial role. Several important grid parameters are open
to choice, and to determine these we proceed as follows. We
ﬁrst choose the values of ∆z and Nρ, then apply a variational
method by adjusting the value of 0
2 until we get
an accurate ground-state energy. Importantly, once this pro-
cedure is completed for a speciﬁc internuclear distance R, the
same scaling factor works well for all R. In this hybrid ﬁnite-
difference/discrete-variable method we noted that there is a
delicate relation among the values of ∆z, Nρ and hρ. For a
ﬁxed Nρ value, if we double the value ∆z, we have to roughly
double the value of hρ in order to maintain accurate energies.
Since the kinetic energy terms are homogeneous in these coor-
dinates this maintains the balance between these terms. In the
following calculations, we take the range of the z coordinate
zmax, zmax], where zmax = 300.9 a.u. and ∆z = 0.1
as [
a.u. (6019 points in all). The z-subspace is shared across the
processor array, in our case we used 13 processors for this
task. The ρ-subspace is spanned fully on each processor and
we take Nρ = 30 with hρ = 0.5185 corresponding to the limit
ρmax ∼
To obtain the ground state eigenvectors it is convenient and
efﬁcient to use an iterative Lanczos method [8]. In Table I, we
list our ground state energies for Λ = 0 and Λ = 1 at different

55 a.u.

eter hρ has been adjusted to 0.5185 for Λ = 0 and 0.146 for

The resolution improves with longer times, T . The trial func-
tion can be chosen to ﬁnd the states of given symmetry. We
have compared the energies of the electronic states at an equi-
librium separation R = 2.0 a.u. with the exact results given
by Sharp [15]; this comparison was previously performed by
Dundas [8]. Our current results are more accurate and better
resolved than those given in [8]. This has been achieved using
a ﬁner axial grid ∆z = 0.1 a.u. as compared with ∆z = 0.2
a.u. [8], but also by adjustment of the scaling factor hρ. By
0.5185 gave the best
trial and error, we determined that hρ ≈
estimates over the full spectrum. The scaling factor can be
considered a variational parameter [12]. This is a useful and
reliable method to determine the optimal grid parameters for
subsequent dynamic calculations.

At the very least, the dimensions of the cylindrical box,
height 2zmax radius ρmax, must be chosen to encompass the
tightly-bound states of the system. However, the evolution
through highly-excited diffuse states and low-energy contin-
uum states is crucial to the ionization mechanism at low fre-
quencies. The rescattering mechanism, by which slow photo-
electrons are driven back to the core region by the laser ﬁeld,

FIG. 1: Population loss for different time steps ∆t. The charac-

means that the box size should be large enough to allow the
continuum states to evolve unfettered. For example, the free-
electron classical amplitude of displacement and momentum
are proportional to E0/ω2
L and E0/ωL, respectively and so
box dimensions of several hundred atomic units may be re-
quired.

The boundary between bound and free electrons was estab-
lished in two ways. We have deﬁned an inner region which
satisﬁes either

where R is the internuclear separation distance and rinner is
taken to be 20 a.u. We also deﬁne an outer box population to
be the total population within the entire grid.

In order to prevent reﬂection of ionizing wavefunction from
the edges of the grid wavefunction splitting which acts in the
same manner as an absorbing potential is applied in both the
z and ρ directions [8].

B. Time propagation parameters

A 12-th order Arnoldi propagator (na = 12) was used in
these calculations. A test of the method for numerical stability
with respect to the time step, ∆t using this choice of propaga-
tor order, na, in conjunction with the spatial grid parameters
outlined above is given in ﬁgure 1. The logarithmic scale ac-
centuates the differences in the residual population at the end
of the pulse. In this case we note the very good convergence
of the method. Results are presented for the following case:

highly accurate time-independent results [16, 17]. Very good
agreement is obtained in all cases.

The same method can be applied to the molecular ion.
However in this case the comparison is not so straightforward.
Plummer and McCann [16] noted that at large bond lengths
the nearly degenerate pair of Σg,u ﬁeld-free states are strongly
split by the external ﬁeld. The correlated eigenstates are a pair
of localised atomic resonances with large differences in their
energies and their widths γ1, γ2. If we apply a static ﬁeld over
a time τ1 = 5 fs, relatively short in comparison to that charac-
terising the gerade-ungerade splitting, that is the hopping time
for the electron betweeen the centers, then the electron divides
equally between the atom sites, creating an equal mixture of
the resonance states rather than an adiabatic transfer to one
or other state. Since γ1 ≫
γ2 this would imply that half of
the population is trapped. Consider the duration of the static
, then the population decay in
ﬁeld Ts such that γ1 ≪

the time-dependent model is given by Γ =
2 γ1,
where γ1 is the width of the short-lived state. If this were the
case, then at longer times Ts ≫
the pop-
ulation should reach a limit of 0.5. Figure 3 shows the popu-
lation as a function of time withτ1 = 5 fs and τ2 = 390 fs for
F = 0.04 and R = 11. The population decays gradually to a
limiting value of 0.5 as predicted. However when the data is

The static ﬁeld ionization rates of the hydrogen atom and
molecular ions are known to a high degree of accuracy us-
ing time-independent methods and provide an important test
of our method. In our time-dependent approach the ﬁeld is
switched on over a time τ1 = 2 fs, with the static ﬁeld main-
tained at a constant value F for τ2 = 6 fs. The rise in the ﬁeld
should be slow enough to ensure an adiabatic transition for the
ﬁeld-free ground state to the metastable state. In table II, we
compare our results for the atom ﬁeld ionization rates with the

plotted on a logarithmic scale we notice that the decay process
is not purely exponential. At the beginning, between 8 fs and
10−3 fs−1
13 fs, we estimate the ionization rate to be 8.75
10−5 fs−1 between 390 fs and 395
and near the end 3.91
fs. The ionization rate calculated by the Floquet method is
10−5 fs−1 for the

wavefunction splitting and population trapping. Further evi-
dence is provided in ﬁgure 4, with ionization rates as a func-
tion of R, compared with those results obtained by Plummer
and McCann [16] for the rate γ1. At larger R values the split-
ting is almost exactly one half in agreement with the adiabatic
trapping model. However, at smaller values of R we note that
the degeneracy of the molecular states is removed and the ion-
ization drops rapidly as the electron is able to move adiabati-
cally into the trapped state.

×

B. Energy shift of metastable states

The method can be applied to calculate the real part of the
quasienergy, that is the Stark shift of the levels. In this case,
we calculate the autocorrelation function C(t) for a trial func-
tion evolving with the external ﬁeld on. We ﬁrst calculate the
shifts for the hydrogen atom and compare with other well-
established results.
In table III, results are compared with
those obtained by the complex-coordinate approach [18] for a
static ﬁeld DC Stark effect. Very good agreement is achieved.
The resolution in the time-dependent method is limited by
1/Tp, where Tp is the du-
the bandwidth theorem: ∆ω
≈
ration of the pulse. The calculation of the AC Stark shift is
done in the same way. We compare with the Floquet method
applied to the hydrogen atom [18] for the angular frequency

case, the periodicity of the Floquet spectrum is clearly vis-

peaks become sharper as the duration of the pulse increases.
However, the resolution is limited by broadening due to the
ionization process. The gap between any two neighbouring
peaks is exactly one photon energy, i.e., 0.057 a.u. for the
present case. From the data we estimate the Stark shift for
0.018 a.u. and for the ﬁrst ex-

results obtained using the velocity-gauge are also shown in

Ionization of positronium

The code can be easily adapted to the ionization of positro-
nium in an intense laser ﬁeld. An investigation of this kind
has been made by Madsen et al [19] using a time-dependent
basis-set expansion. The scaling factor hρ is adjusted to be
0.52085 for Ps with ∆z = 0.1 a.u. and Nρ = 30 to optimize
the ground state energy to
0.250000001 a.u.. For the sake
of comparison [19], the velocity gauge is used and the pulse
is taken as

cannot calculate the rate so easily from observation of popu-
lation decay. In physical terms, in an experiment this corre-
sponds to saturation, that is the molecules fully ionize before
the pulse has ﬁnished. In this case it is difﬁcult for experi-
ments to analyse the response of the system. This requires
extremely short pulses, with associated rapidly-varying pulse
envelope and broad bandwidth. Under such circumstance a
time-dependent treatment is indispensable. The fragmenta-
tion of H+
2 by an intense infrared laser (λ = 790 nm) is a
1015 W
problem of current interest. For an intensity I = 3
cm−2, and R = 5 a.u. the ionization rate is roughly 5.5fs−1.
Thus the molecule will be fully ionized within a fraction of
an optical cycle. Mathematically, the ionization rates in this
regime can be calculated by scaling as shown by Madsen et
al. [19]. Using the arbitrary dimensionless parameters α and
β we can change the scale of length and time according to

We take a pulse duration Tp = 50 fs and a wavelength λ =

shown in ﬁgure 7. Our results are in very good agreement with
those of Madsen et al [19] over a wide range and especially for
the intermediate intensities.

The numerical stability scaling can be tested at intensities
below saturation. In table IV, we compare the scaled ground-
state energies and ionization rates obtained with those from
1014 W
a direct calculation for λ = 800 nm and I = 3.2
cm−2 at various internuclear distances. The agreement is rea-
sonable with relative errors in ionization rates below 9%. The
values of the scaling parameters in this case are α = 1.43 and
β = 1.43. The interest in obtaining rates at high intensity fol-
lows experimental work that estimated the bond length depen-
dence of ionization rate from the ion energy spectrum [20, 21].
Our results are compared with experimental spectra in ﬁg-
ures 8 and 9 taking α = 1.43 and β = 1.43. The experi-
mental measurements collect ions over a large part of the fo-
cal volume, and hence we adjust the normalization of the data
to the theoretical results. It is surprising and remarkable to
note that both spectra, experimental and theoretical, are dom-
inated by a single large peak and that its location is repro-
duced accurately by the theory. For R < 7 the shape of the
ionization rate is quite well reproduced. This is surprising in

than 7 a.u., there is no dependence on bond length, indicating
the loss of molecular effects. An essential assumption in the
theoretical model is that the molecules are equally populated
at all R corresponding to the ionization process occurring as
the molecule dissociates at steady speed. An explanation of
the experimental shortfall in ions from large R is that if the
molecule ionizes fully at smaller R it cannot survive to yield
ions at large bond lengths and the ion yield rapidly drops. The
other point in ﬁgure 8 deserving note is the overall leftward
displacement of our theoretical curve compared with the ex-
perimental one. There is the possibility that the experimen-
tal calibration of the laser intensity underestimates the actual
intensity experienced by the molecules. A very rough simu-
lation of the molecule depletion is shown in ﬁgure 9 is which
the theoretical ion yield is exponentially attenuated. The curve
R
shown is P (R) = Γ(R) exp(
R0 Γ(R)/v(R) dR) where
−
v(R) is the relative velocity of the ions taken to be the clas-
sical value for Coulomb repulsion mpv2/4 + 1/R0 = 1/R.
The factor C is an empirical constant taken to ﬁt to the ex-
0.2 gives the best
perimental curve in ﬁgure 9. We ﬁnd C
shape for the distribution. Taking C = 1 leads to a severe
loss of ions at large R, almost no ions survive beyond R = 7
in this approximation. Of course one might expect that the
low intensity focal averaging process might raise the yield of
ions from large R and give a more realistic picture of the pro-
cess. This would require inclusion of the attenuation correc-
tions discussed above. Nonetheless, it is fair to compare this
theory and experiment for small R values, and in this respect
the agreement is remarkably good.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have made a detailed investigation of a method which is
designed to solve the reduced-dimensionality time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for metastable systems in intense ﬁelds.
We have checked the reliability of the present code by exam-
ining the convergence and the gauge dependence. Applica-
tions to several problems have been carried out and yield good
agreement with other available theoretical results. However,
by direct solution of the TDSE, our method can be applied
to both short and long pulses and to a large variety of wave-
lengths. The provision of parallel computer architecture offers
the opportunity to study such systems from ﬁrst principles and
in full dimensionality.

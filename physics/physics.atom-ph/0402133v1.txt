Energies of ns1/2 (n= 6-9), npj (n = 6-8), ndj (n= 6-7), and 5fj states in neutral Au and Au-like
ions with nuclear charges Z = 80 − 83 are calculated using relativistic many-body perturbation
theory. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths, transition rates and lifetimes are determined
for the 30 possible nlj − n′l′
j′ electric-dipole transitions. Results for a limited number states ns1/2,
npj (n= 6-7) and 6dj are obtained in the relativistic single-double (SD) approximation, where
single and double excitations of Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders in perturbation
theory. Using SD wave functions, accurate values are obtained for energies of the eight lowest states
and for the fourteen possible electric-dipole matrix elements between these states. With the aid of
the SD wave functions, we also determine transition rates and oscillator strengths for the fourteen
transitions together with lifetimes of 6pj, 7pj , and 6dj levels. We investigate the hyperﬁne structure
in Hg II and Tl III. The hyperﬁne A-values are determined for 6s1/2 and 6pj states in 199Hg+,
201Hg+, and 205Tl2+ isotopes. These calculations provide a theoretical benchmark for comparison
with experiment and theory.

INTRODUCTION

This work continues earlier relativistic many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) studies of energy levels of ions
with one valence electron outside a closed core. In Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4] third-order MBPT was used to calculate energies
of the three lowest states (ns1/2, np1/2, and np3/2) in Li-, Na-, Cu-, and Ag-like ions along the respective isoelectronic
sequences. Third-order MBPT calculations of 6s1/2 − 6pj transition amplitudes in Au-like ions up to Z=85 were
performed in [5]. In the present paper, we extend the previous calculations to obtain energies of the sixteen lowest
levels, ns1/2 (n= 6-9), npj (n = 6-8), ndj (n= 6-7), and 5fj states, reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths, and
transition rates for the 30 possible nlj − n′l′
j′ electric-dipole transitions. Additionally, we evaluate lifetimes of excited
states for 6pj, 7pj, and 6dj levels in neutral Au and Au-like ions with nuclear charges Z = 80 − 83.

For the eight lowest states, 6s1/2, 6pj, 7pj, and 6dj, we go beyond third-order MBPT and use the SD method,
in which single and double excitations of the Dirac-Fock (DF) wave functions are summed to all orders, to evaluate
energies, transition rates, and lifetimes. The SD method was applied previously to study properties of Li and Be+
in [6], Na and Cs in [7], Cs in [8], Na-like ions with Z ranging from 11 to 16 in [9], and alkali-metal atoms Na, K,
Rb, and Cs in [10]. It should be noted that the n =1, 2, and 3 cores of Li-, Na-, and Cu-like ions are completely
ﬁlled, by contrast with Ag- and Au-like ions, where the n = 4 and n = 5 cores [Cu+]4s24p64d10 and [Nd]5s25p65d10,
respectively, are incomplete.

Our results are compared with the theoretical results found in Refs. [5, 11, 12, 13, 14] and with experimental
measurements from Refs. [15, 16, 17]. Large-scale ab initio multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations were
used in [11] to obtain oscillator strengths and hyperﬁne-structure parameters for the lowest few levels in Tl III.
Theoretical oscillator strengths and hyperﬁne-structure parameters in Hg II were determined in [12] using the MCDF
method for resonance transitions. A large number of transitions were also treated in [12] using a more ﬂexible, but
less accurate, version of the MCDF method. These results were used in stellar atmosphere models, assuming local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) where a line-by-line investigation was important. This was part of a program for
studying chemically peculiar stars using the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) on board the Hubble
Space Telescope. The ability of an ab initio relativistic model potential approach with explicit local exchange to
produce oscillator strengths in agreement with MCDF data was tested for seven transitions in Au-like ions (Au I,
Hg II, Tl III, and Pb IV) in [13]. In [14], a “weakest bound electron potential” model was employed to study transition

probabilities in Au I. In this model, coupled equations were used to obtain parameters Z ∗, n∗, and l∗ used in the
calculation of transition probabilities.

Determinations of radiative lifetimes of excited states in neutral gold using time-resolved vacuum-ultraviolet laser
spectroscopy were reported in Ref. [15]. Recently, in Ref. [16], measurements were reported for lifetimes of the 6pj,
6pdj, 7s1/2, 7pj, 7dj, and 5fj levels in Tl III using beam-foil excitation. As noted in [16], the Tl spectra in the Hubble
Space Telescope observations of peculiar stars required oscillator-strength data for their interpretation. The spectrum
of Hg II was observed from 500 ˚A to 9880 ˚A with sliding sparks and pulsed radio-frequency discharges in [17], where
about 500 lines were classiﬁed as transition between 114 energy levels. The observed conﬁgurations (5d10nl, 5d96s5f ,
5d96l6l′, 5d96l7l′, and 5d86s26p) were theoretically interpreted by means of HF calculations and least-squares ﬁts of
energy parameters. The ﬁtted parameters were then used to calculate oscillator strengths for most of the classiﬁed
lines [17].

In present paper, energies of ns1/2 (n= 6-9), npj (n = 6-8), ndj (n= 6-7), and 5fj states in neutral Au and
Hg II, Tl III, Pb IV, and Bi V are obtained using relativistic MBPT. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths,
transition rates, and lifetimes are calculated for the 30 possible nlj − n′l′
j′ electric-dipole transitions. The eight lowest
states ns1/2 (n= 6-7), npj (n= 6-7) and 6dj are treated more accurately using the all-order SD method. We also
use the SD method to obtain transition rates, oscillator strengths for electric dipole transitions between these states,
and lifetimes of the 6pj, 7pj, and 6dj levels. Additionally, we evaluate hyperﬁne A-values for 6s1/2 and 6pj states in
199Hg+, 201Hg+, and 205Tl2+ isotopes.

II. THIRD-ORDER MBPT CALCULATIONS OF ENERGIES OF AU-LIKE IONS

Results of our third-order calculations of energies, which are carried out following the pattern described in [4], are
summarized in Table I, where we list lowest-order, Dirac-Fock energies E(0), ﬁrst-order Breit energies B(1), second-
order Coulomb E(2) and Breit B(2) energies, third-order Coulomb energies E(3), single-particle Lamb shift corrections
E LS, and the sum of the above Etot. The ﬁrst-order Breit energies include retardation, whereas the second-order
Breit energies are evaluated using the unretarded Breit operator. The Lamb shift is approximated as the sum of
the one-electron self energy and the ﬁrst-order vacuum-polarization energy. The vacuum-polarization contribution is
calculated from the Uehling potential using the results of Fullerton and Rinker [18]. The self-energy contribution is
estimated for s, p1/2 and p3/2 orbitals by interpolating among the values obtained by Mohr [19, 20, 21] using Coulomb
wave functions. For this purpose, an eﬀective nuclear charge Zeﬀ is obtained by ﬁnding the value of Zeﬀ required to
give a Coulomb orbital with the same average hri as the DHF orbital.

We ﬁnd that correlation corrections to energies in neutral Au and Au-like ions are large, especially for 6s states.
For example, E(2) is 28% of E(0) and E(3) is 27% of E(2) for the 6s state of neutral Au. The ratio E(2)/E(0) decreases
for the other (less penetrating) states and for more highly charged ions but the second ratio E(3)/E(2) decreases only
slowly for more excited states and even increases with Z for the 6s state of Bi V. Despite the slow convergence of the
perturbation expansion, the 6s energy from the present third-order MBPT calculation is within 2.3% of the measured
ionization energy for the 6s state of neutral Au and improves for higher valence states and for more highly charged
ions. The order of levels with respect to energy in Table I changes from ion to ion; thus, for example, the 5f5/2 and
5f7/2 states are in the twelfth and thirteenth places for neutral Au, in the tenth and eleventh places for Hg II, and in
the seventh and eighth places for Bi V. It should be mentioned that the diﬀerence in energies of 5fj and 7dj states is
less than 60 cm−1 for Au I, which may exceed the accuracy of the present calculations.

Below, we describe a few numerical details of the calculation. We use B-spline methods [22] to generate a complete
set of basis DHF wave functions for use in the evaluation of MBPT expressions. For Au I and Bi V, we use 40 splines of
order k = 7 for each angular momentum. The basis orbitals are constrained to cavities of radii 85 a.u. and 55 a.u. for
Au I and Bi V, respectively. The cavity radius is scaled for diﬀerent ions; it is chosen large enough to accommodate all
6lj and 5fj orbitals considered here and small enough that 40 splines can approximate inner-shell DHF wave functions
with good precision. We use 35 out 40 basis orbitals for each partial wave in our third-order energy calculations, since
contributions from the ﬁve highest-energy orbitals are negligible. The second-order calculation includes partial waves
up to lmax = 8 and is extrapolated to account for contributions from higher partial waves. A lower number of partial
waves, lmax = 6, is used in the third-order calculation. Since the asymptotic l-dependence of the second- and third-
order energies are similar (both fall oﬀ as l−4), we may use the second-order remainder as a guide to extrapolating
the third-order energy.

In Table II, we compare our results for energy levels of the sixteen single-particle states of interest in Au I, Hg II,
Tl III, and Pb IV with recommended data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database
[23]. Although our results are generally in good agreement with the NIST data, discrepancies were found. One cause
for these discrepancies is that fourth- and higher-order correlation corrections are omitted in the theory. A second
possible cause is the omission of hole-particle-particle states in our single-particle model space. The importance

3

of 5d10np + 5d96s6p and 5d10nf + 5d96s6p mixing for Au I was underlined by Henderson et al. [16]. Moreover,
Sansonetti and Reader [17] included hole-particle-particle states, 5d96s5f , 5d96l6l′, 5d96l7l′ in calculations used to
classify the observed spectrum of Hg II.

III. ALL-ORDER SD CALCULATIONS OF ENERGIES OF AU-LIKE IONS

Results of our all-order SD calculations for the seven lowest states of Au-like ions are presented in Table III, where
we list ﬁrst-order (DHF) energies E(1), SD correlation energies ESD, omitted third-order terms E(3)
extra, ﬁrst- and
second-order Breit energies B(n), n = 1, 2, single-particle Lamb shift corrections E LS, totals E tot, and values from
NIST, ENIST [23] for Au I, Hg II, Tl III, Pb IV, and Bi V. The values ESD are evaluated using the SD method. The
SD equations are set up in a ﬁnite basis and solved iteratively to give the single- and double-excitation coeﬃcients
and the correlation energy ESD. The contributions E(3)
extra in Table III accounts for that part of the third-order
MBPT correction not included in the SD energy (see Eq. (2.17) in Ref. [24]). The basis orbitals used to deﬁne the
single-particle SD states are linear combinations of B-splines.

As can be seen by comparing Tables I and III, the dominant contribution to ESD is the second-order term E(2). We
have already mentioned the importance of higher partial wave contributions to E(2) and E(3). In the SD calculation,
we include partial waves through l=6 in ESD and use the diﬀerence E(2)
l≤6 to estimate the accuracy of our result.
The columns with headings δE in Tables II and III show the diﬀerences between our ab initio results and the
recommended NIST data [23]. As can be seen, the SD results agree better with the recommended NIST data [23]
than do the third-order MBPT results, especially for ionization potential. This conﬁrms our previous comments
concerning the slow convergence of perturbation theory and illustrates the importance of fourth- and higher-order
correlation corrections. Those diﬀerences between the present theoretical results and the recommended NIST data
[23] that were not improved by the SD method are most probably due to the omission of hole-particle-particle states
mentioned previously.

IV. DIPOLE MATRIX ELEMENTS, OSCILLATOR STRENGTHS, AND LIFETIMES IN AU-LIKE IONS

Transition matrix elements provide another test of the quality of atomic-structure calculations and another measure
of the size of correlation corrections. Reduced matrix elements of the dipole operator in ﬁrst-, second-, third-, and
all-order perturbation theory between low-lying states of Au I and Bi V are presented in Table IV. The ﬁrst-order
reduced matrix elements Z (1) are obtained from length-form DHF calculations. Length-form and velocity-form matrix
elements diﬀer typically by 1 - 3%. Second-order matrix element in the table, Z (2), which include Z (1), are extended
to include the second-order correction associated with the random-phase approximation (RPA).

The third-order matrix elements Z (3) include Z (RPA) (all higher-order RPA corrections), Bruekner-orbital Z (BO),
structural radiation Z (SR), and normalization Z (NORM) corrections, described, for example in Refs. [24, 25]. As can
be seen in Table IV, RPA corrections are very large, 10-40%, being smallest for the 6pj-7s1/2 transitions.

Electric-dipole matrix elements evaluated in the SD approximation are given in columns headed Z (SD) in Table IV.
A detailed discussion of calculations of matrix elements in the SD approximation is found in Ref. [6]. It should be noted
that SD matrix elements Z SD include Z (3) completely, along with important fourth- and higher-order corrections.
Those fourth-order corrections omitted from SD matrix elements were discussed recently by Derevianko and Emmons
[26].

We carried out third-order calculations for a much longer list of transitions than presented in Table IV. The results
of our third-order calculations are summarized in Table V, where we list oscillator strengths for thirty 6s − 6p, 6s − 7p,
6s − 8p, 6p − 6d, 6p − 7s, 6p − 8s, 6d − 7p, 6d − 5f , and 5f − 7d transitions in Au I, Hg II, Tl III, Pb IV, and Bi V.
For each ion the oscillator strengths are calculated in ﬁrst- and third-order MBPT; f (1) and f (3). It should be noted,
that we use theoretical energies in the same order of approximation (columns E(0) and Etot from Table I) to calculate
f (1) and f (3), respectively. In Table V, we have marked 6d − 7p transition for Au I with an asterisk, since the order of
initial and ﬁnal states is reversed for these transitions. As can be seen from Table V, the diﬀerence between f (1) and
f (3) ranges from 10% to 40% for cases with large values of oscillator strengths (6s − 6p, 7p − 8s, 6p − 6d, and 6d − 5f
transitions). For cases with small oscillator strengths(6s − 7p and 5f − 7d transitions), diﬀerences between f (1) and
f (3) can be a factor of 10. In the case of 6s − 7p transitions, large diﬀerences between dipole matrix element Z (3) and
Z (1) are responsible for the large diﬀerences between f (3) and f (1) (see Table IV), whereas, in the case of 5f − 7d
transitions, large diﬀerences in transition energies (see Table I) are responsible for the large f (3) – f (1) diﬀerences.

In Table VI, we compare our oscillator strength data with theoretical results from Ref. [13] and with available
experimental measurements. The oscillator strengths f SD in the table are calculated in the SD approximation. It

4

should be noted, that theoretical SD energies Etot from Table III are used to calculate f SD. Theoretical oscillator
strengths f theor from [13] were calculated using polarizable frozen ion-like Dirac-Fock method (DF+CP). The ex-
perimental data f expt listed in Table VI are from Ref. [13] and references therein. The accuracy of the experimental
f -values is not very high and in some cases the diﬀerence between results from diﬀerent measurements is larger than
the diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical results.

We calculate lifetimes of 6pj, 6dj, 7s1/2, and 7pj levels in neutral Au and in Au-like ions with Z = 80–83 using both
third-order MBPT and SD results for dipole matrix elements and energies. We list lifetimes, τ (SD) and wavelengths,
λ(SD), obtained by SD method in Table VII. In this table, we compare our lifetime data with available experimental
measurements that are primarily obtained for 6pj levels. The experimental data are from Ref. [16] and references
therein. Even for these lowest-lying states we have 5 - 10% disagreement between our τ (SD) and τ expt for both, 6p1/2
and 6p3/2 states in Au I, Hg II, and Tl III, and for the 6p3/2 state in Bi V. This is somewhat strange since we have
perfect agreement between λ(SD) and λexpt for all of these levels, as can be seen in Table VII.

V. HYPERFINE CONSTANTS FOR AU-LIKE IONS

Calculations of hyperﬁne constants follow the same pattern as the calculations of reduced dipole matrix elements
described in the previous section. The magnetic moments and nuclear spins used in present calculations are taken
In Table VIII, we give the magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne constant A for 205Tl III, 199Hg II, and 201Hg II
from [27].
and compare with available theoretical and experimental data from Refs. [11, 12], and references therein. In this
table, we present the ﬁrst-order A(DF), third-order A(3), and all-order A(SD) values for 6s1/2, 6p1/2, and 6p3/2 levels.
As discussed before for dipole matrix elements, third-order hyperﬁne constants A(3) include RPA A(RPA), Bruekner-
orbital A(BO), structural radiation A (SR), and normalization A (NORM) corrections. The diﬀerence between third-
and ﬁrst-order contributions as can be seen from Table VIII, is 20 - 30 %. The Bruekner-orbital term A(BO) gives the
largest correction in all cases. As can be seen from Table VIII, the all-order SD A(SD) results are in better agreement
with the theoretical results A(theor) from Refs. [11, 12], than are the third-order values A(3). Moreover, A(SD) and
A(theor) agree better with each other than with experimental data A(expt).

VI. CONCLUSION

In summary, a systematic MBPT study of the energies of ns1/2 (n= 6-9), npj (n = 6-8), ndj (n= 6-7), and 5fj
states in neutral Au and Au-like ions with nuclear charges Z = 80 − 83 is presented. The energy calculations are
in good agreement with existing experimental energy data and provide a theoretical reference database for the line
identiﬁcation. A systematic relativistic MBPT study of reduced matrix elements and oscillator strengths for the 30
possible 6s − 6p, 6s − 7p, 6s − 8p, 6p − 6d, 6p − 7s, 6p − 8s, 6d − 7p, 6d − 5f , and 5f − 7d transitions in Au I,
Hg II, Tl III, Pb IV, and Bi V is conducted. Both length and velocity forms of matrix elements are evaluated. Small
diﬀerences between length and velocity-form calculations, caused by the nonlocality of the DF potential, are found
in second order. However, including third-order corrections with full RPA leads to complete agreement between the
length- and velocity-form results. Hyperﬁne A-values are presented for 6s1/2 and 6pj states in 199Hg+, 201Hg+, and
205Tl2+ ions.

We believe that our energies and transition rates will be useful in analyzing existing experimental data and in
planning new experiments. There remains a paucity of experimental data for many of the higher ionized members of
this sequence, both for term energies and for lifetimes.

Abstract

The isotope shifts of forbidden transitions in Be- and B-like argon ions are calculated.
It is shown that only using the relativistic recoil operator can provide a proper evaluation
of the mass isotope shift, which strongly dominates over the ﬁeld isotope shift for the ions
under consideration. Comparing the isotope shifts calculated with the current experimen-
tal uncertainties indicates very good perspectives for a ﬁrst test of the relativistic theory
of the recoil eﬀect in middle-Z ions.

1 Introduction

Recent high-precision measurements of forbidden transitions in highly charged argon ions [1]
provide very good possibilities for tests of relativistic and quantum electrodynamic (QED)
eﬀects in middle-Z few-electron systems. In particular, in the case of Ar13+ the QED contri-
bution to the 2s2 2p 2P1/2 −2 P3/2 transition energy is by four orders of magnitude larger than
the corresponding experimental error. From the theoretical side, however, large eﬀorts must
be undertaken to achieve this accuracy (for the current theoretical results, see [1]). The main
goal of this paper is to calculate the isotope shifts of forbiden transitions in Be-like and B-like
argon and to examine a possibility for their experimental determination.

The isotope shifts in the atomic transition energies arise from the ﬁnite nuclear mass (recoil
eﬀect) and from the ﬁnite nuclear size (ﬁeld or volume shift). Generally, the ﬁeld shift, caused

1

by the penetration of the electron wave functions into the nuclear region, dominates for heavy
atoms whereas the mass shift dominates for light atoms.

The relativistic units (¯h = c = 1) are used in the paper.

2 Mass shift

The nonrelativistic (NR) theory of the mass shift for many-electron atoms was ﬁrst formulated
by Hughes and Eckart [2]. This shift can be represented as the sum of two parts, the normal
mass shift (NMS) and the speciﬁc mass shift (SMS). The normal mass shift operator is a
one-particle operator. It is given by

where pi is the momentum operator and M is the nuclear mass. The speciﬁc mass shift operator,
which is a two-particle operator, can be written in the form

H (nr)

NMS =

The sum of expressions (1) and (2) deﬁnes the total recoil operator in the nonrelativistic theory.

The full relativistic theory of the nuclear recoil eﬀect can be formulated only within quantum
electrodynamics. Such a theory was ﬁrst formulated in [3], where the complete αZ - dependence
formulas for the recoil corrections to the atomic energy levels to ﬁrst order in m/M were derived.
Later, these formulas were rederived in simpler ways for the case of a hydrogenlike atom [4, 5] as
well as for a general case of a many-electron atom [6] (see also [7]). Full relativistic calculations
of the recoil eﬀect, based on these formulas, were performed for H- and Li-like ions [8, 9, 10]. In
[5], they were employed to calculate the recoil corrections in H-like atoms to order (αZ)6m2/M,
where α is the ﬁne structure constant. As follows from these formulas, within the lowest-order
relativistic approximation (∼ v2/c2) and to ﬁrst order in m/M, the recoil corrections can be
derived by using the following recoil Hamiltonian

2M

pi · pj −

where α is a vector incorporating the Dirac matrices. The expectation value of HM on the Dirac
wave function yields the recoil correction to the atomic energy level to ﬁrst order in m/M (here
and in what follows, the Dirac wave functions are the eigenvectors of the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit
Hamiltonian). An independent derivation of Hamiltonian (3) was presented in [11]. In [12],
this Hamiltonian was employed to calculate the (αZ)4m2/M corrections to the energy levels of
He- and Li-like middle-Z ions.

According to expression (3), the lowest-order relativistic correction to the one-electron recoil

operator is given by

To the lowest order in m/M, the mass isotope shift is determined as the diﬀerence of the
expectation values of the recoil Hamiltonian for two diﬀerent isotopes:

δEMS = hψ|(HM1 − HM2)|ψi = −

δM
M1 M2

K ,

where δM = M1 − M2 is the nuclear mass diﬀerence, |ψi is the eigenvector of the Dirac-
Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian, and the constant K is deﬁned by

K/M = hψ|HM |ψi .

It should be stressed here that our approach to the relativistic recoil eﬀect diﬀers from those
in [13, 14, 15, 16], where the nonrelativistic recoil Hamiltonian was evaluated with the Dirac
wave functions. Averaging the nonrelativistic recoil operator with the Dirac wave functions
strongly overestimates the relativistic correction to the recoil eﬀect. It is caused by the fact (see
[3, 8]) that the relativistic contribution that results from averaging the nonrelativistic nuclear
recoil operator with the Dirac wave functions is considerably cancelled by the contribution of
the relativistic correction operator deﬁned by equations (4),(5). For this reason, the relativistic
wave functions must be employed only in calculations with the relativistic recoil Hamiltonian
(3).

3 Field shift

The ﬁeld isotope shift is caused by diﬀerent nuclear charge distributions for diﬀerent isotopes.
For the nuclear charge distribution we used the Fermi model:

where the parameter a was chosen to be a = 2.3/4 ln 3 and parameters N and c can be obtained
from the known value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius R = hr2i1/2 and from
the normalization condition for ρ(r, R):

With a high accuracy, N and c can be determined by the following analytical formulas (see,
e.g., [17])

ρ(r, R) =

N
1 + exp[(r − c)/a]

This potential was used in the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian to obtain the relativistic wave

δEFS = hψ|

δVN (ri, R)|ψi ,

(12)

Xi

where

δVN (r) = VN (r, R + δR) − VN (r, R),
δR is the diﬀerence of the rms nuclear charge radii for two isotopes, and δhr2i is the related
diﬀerence of the mean-square nuclear radii. Within the precision required, the direct evaluation
of the ﬁeld isotope shift by solving the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit equation for two diﬀerent isotopes
yields the same results.

(13)

Concluding this section, we note that in the case of a hydrogenlike atom the isotope shift

can easily be calculated according to analytical formulas presented in [17].

4 Method of calculation

In this work, the large-scale conﬁguration-interaction (CI) Dirac-Fock (DF) method was used to
solve the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit equation and to calculate the energies and the isotope shifts of
the forbidden transitions in Ar14+, Ar13+, and Kr22+. The many-electron wave function Ψ(γJ)
with quantum numbers γ and J was expanded in terms of a large number of the conﬁguration
state functions (CFSs) with the same J

Ψ(γJ) =

cα Φα(J).

(14)

α
X
For every relativistic atomic conﬁguration the CFSs Φα(J) are eigenfunctions of the square of
total angular momentum J 2 and they can be obtained as the linear combinations of the Slater
determinants corresponding to this conﬁguration. The set of the CFSs in expansion (14) was
generated including all single and double excitations and some part of triple excitations.

The Slater determinants are constructed from one-electron four-component Dirac spinors
(orbitals). For the occupied shells these orbitals (ϕj) were obtained by the multiconﬁguration
Dirac-Fock (DF) method. The other vacant orbitals ( ˜ϕj) were obtained by solving the Dirac-
Fock-Sturm equations

hDF − εj0
h

i

˜ϕj = λj W (r) ˜ϕj,

(15)

where hDF is the Dirac-Fock operator, εj0 is the one-electron energy of the occupied DF orbital
ϕj0, and W (r) is a constant sign weight function. The parameter λj in equation (15) can be
considered as an eigenvalue of the Sturmian operator. If W (r) → 0 at r → ∞, all Sturmian
functions ϕj have the same asymptotics at r → ∞. It is clear that for λj = 0 the Sturmian
function coincides with the reference DF orbital ϕj0. The widely known choice of the weight

4

function is W (r) = 1/r, which leads to the well known ’charge quantization’. In the relativistic
case this choice of the weight function is not very successful. In our calculations we used the
following weight function

W (r) = −

1 − exp(−(α r)2)
(α r)2

.

(16)

In contrast to 1/r, this weight function is regular at origin. It is well-known that the Sturmian
operator is Hermitian and it does not contain continuum spectra in contrast to the Fock oper-
ator. Therefore, the set of the Sturmian eigenfunctions forms the discrete and complete basis
set of one-electron wave functions.

5 Results and discussion

Before discussing our results for the isotope shifts in argon ions, we examine our calculations
of the speciﬁc mass shift for the 3p1/2 − 3s transition in Na-like ions and compare them with
the related results from [15]. In Table 1 we present our results for the SMS contribution to the
isotope-shift constant K, deﬁned by equation (7). The second column shows the nonrelativistic
values of this contribution. These values were obtained within the same CIDF method and
the same computer code, as described above, by the 1000-times increase of the velocity of light
(in atomic units). We veriﬁed this nonrelativistic limit by comparing the total energies for the
Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian with the total energies obtained by the fully nonrelativistic
method based on the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian and on the same calculation scheme. The total
energies exactly coincide with each other for all the ions.
In the third column we present
the results obtained by averaging the nonrelativistic recoil operator (2) on the Dirac wave
functions. The fourth column indicates the relativistic correction that results from using the
Dirac wave functions in the calculation of the nonrelativistic-recoil-operator contribution. In the
ﬁfth column we give the relativistic correction obtained by averaging the relativistic correction
operator (5). In the sixth column the total relativistic data are listed. The last column indicates
the results of [15], based on averaging the nonrelativistic recoil operator with the Dirac wave
functions. Comparing the relativistic corrections, presented in the fourth and ﬁfth columns, we
observe that the absolute value of the second relativistic correction is larger than the absolute
value of the ﬁrst one and, as a result, the total relativistic correction and the correction that
accounts only for the relativistic eﬀects on the wave functions are of opposite sign. This means
that using only the nonrelativistic part of the recoil operator in calculations based on employing
the Dirac wave functions gives strongly incorrect results for the relativistic recoil eﬀect.

For the 3p1/2 − 3s transition in neutral Na, the experimental value of the isotope shift
amounts to -758.5(0.7) MHz [18]. To derive the corresponding SMS we have to subtract the
NMS and FS from the experimental isotope shift. The nonrelativistic NMS has been evaluated
as the −m/M fraction of the nonrelativistic transition energy, obtained as the diﬀerence between
the experimental value of the transition energy (16956.2 cm−1) and the related relativistic
correction (45.4 cm−1), calculated in this work. As a result, the nonrelativistic NMS was
obtained to be -549.7 MHz. The sum of this value and the relativistic NMS correction (-
9.7 MHz), calculated in this work, yields -559.4 MHz for the total NMS value. Subtracting
this NMS value and our theoretical FS value (6.9 MHz) from the experimental isotope shift,
we obtain the value -206.0 MHz for the SMS and -104 (GHz amu) for the SMS contribution to

5

the constant K. This value diﬀers from our theoretical result -98.5 GHz amu (Table 1) by 6%
and from the result of [15] by 7%. The disagreement between the theoretical and experimental
values is mainly caused by the correlation eﬀects, which are extremely large for neutral Na. It
is very diﬃcult to compute the isotope shift parameters for neutral Na with high accuracy. For
systematic investigations of the nonrelativistic isotope shift by the multiconﬁguration Hartree-
Fock method we refer to [19], where an extremly large CI expansion was used. Although in our
relativistic calculations the CI expansion is not so large, it is suﬃcient to show the role of the
relativistic eﬀects in the series of Na-like ions.

Table 2 shows the ﬁeld-shift constant F , deﬁned by δEFS = −F δhr2i, for the 3p1/2 − 3s
transition in Na-like ions. The comparison of the nonrelativistic (second column) and relativistic
(third column) data demonstrates the role of the relativistic eﬀects in the ﬁeld isotope shifts.
Our relativistic ﬁeld-shift constants are in a good agreement with the related data from [15],
presented in the fourth column of the table.

In Table 3 we present the results of our calculations for the isotope shifts in 40Ar13+/36Ar13+,
40Ar14+/36Ar14+, and 86Kr22+/84Kr22+. To calculate the ﬁeld isotope shift, we used the rms nu-
clear charge radii given in [20]. Since we consider transitions between levels which diﬀer from
each other only by the total angular momentum, the corresponding transition energies are com-
pletely determined by relativistic and QED eﬀects. In particular, it means that all the mass and
ﬁeld shift contributions given in the table are of pure relativistic origin. Comparing the individ-
ual mass shift contributions given in the Table 3, we again observe a very signiﬁcant cancellation
of the contributions from the nonrelativistic part of the recoil operator (H (nr)
SMS) by the
corresponding contributions from the relativistic part of the recoil operator (H (r)
SMS). It
can also be seen that the mass isotope shift strongly dominates over the ﬁeld isotope shift for
the ions under consideration.

NMS + H (nr)

NMS + H (r)

In Table 4, we compare the isotope shifts calculated in this paper with the total theoretical
and experimental values for the transition energies under consideration [1]. The non-QED
parts of the theoretical values for the transition energies were obtained by the large-scale CIDF
method described in the previous section. The QED corrections were evaluated by using the
one-electron Lamb shift data taken from [21] with an eﬀective nuclear charge number Zeﬀ. For
a given one-electron state, Zeﬀ was chosen to reproduce the related DF electron charged density
at the Compton wavelength distance from the nucleus. For the argon ions, these results are
also in a fair agreement with the corresponding results of Refs. [22, 23] presented in the third
column. In the sixth column of Table 4 we present the total isotope shifts in 40Ar13+/36Ar13+.
These data were obtained with the Dirac multiconﬁguration wave functions and their relative
errors are determined by the relative errors in the wave functions. As one can see from the
table, the isotope shift in 40Ar13+/36Ar13+ is by an order of magnitude larger than the current
experimental error. This provides very good perspectives for a ﬁrst test of the relativistic theory
for the recoil eﬀect in middle-Z ions.

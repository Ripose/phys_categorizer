Abstract

An exact solution of the time-dependent Dirac equation for ionization and

pair production induced by ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is presented.

Exact transition probabilities, equivalent to those that would be obtained

in an untruncated basis coupled channels calculation, are presented. Exact

bound-electron positron pair production probabilities are calculated to be

mostly smaller than those calculated with the same potential in perturbation

theory at impact parameters small enough for diﬀerences to occur.

PACS: 34.90.+q, 25.75.-q

The calculation of bound-electron positron pair production induced by relativisitic heavy

ion collisions has been a subject great interest recently [1]. One motivation for this interest is

the anticipated large rates of pair production with an electron captured into a bound state of

one of the pair of fully stripped ions in a collider such as the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy-

Ion Collider (RHIC) or the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The capture process will

provide an important limit on the beam lifetime since change of the charge of an ion leads

to the loss of that ion from the beam. Early non-perturbative coupled channel calculations

showed an enhancement of some two orders of magnitude [2] over corresponding perturba-

tion theory calculations at small impact parameters for Pb + Pb reactions at relatively low

relativistivc energies (e.g., γ=2.3). These results motivated an extensive investigation at

ultrarelativistic energies such as will occur at RHIC (γ=23 000), and the problem of non-

1

perturbative enhancemant was shown to present no serious obstacle to machine performance.

It was found that the enhancement over perturbation theory systematically decreased with

increasing basis size of the coupled channels calculations up to the largest basis size at-

tainable, where the total non-perturbative enhancement was found to be only of order 10%

of the total cross section [3]. It was further observed that the limited enhancement over

perturbation theory applied as well at other ultrarelativistic energies (such as at LHC) since

the probabilities at impact parameters small enough to have non-perturbative eﬀects are γ

independent at large γ [4].

In this Letter it will be shown that, in the ultrarelativistic limit, the time-dependent

Dirac equation can be solved exactly, and one discovers that exact semi-classical probabil-

ities of bound-electron positron pair production are actually less than those calculated in

perturbation theory. One also obtains exact results for single electron ionization and ﬁnds

that they are consistent with unitarity. As a corollary, ionization calculations can now be

carried out without consideration of the continuum ﬁnal states but rather by considering

the ﬂux lost from the initial bound state.

It has recently been shown [5] that, in the appropriate gauge [4], the Coulomb potential

produced by an ultrarelativistic particle (such as a heavy ion) in uniform motion takes the

following form

V (ρ, z, t) =

δ(z

t)αZP (1

αz) ln

−

(1)

b is the impact parameter, perpendicular to the z–axis along which the ion travels, ρ, z,

and t are the coordinates of the potential relative to a ﬁxed target (or ion), αz is the Dirac

matrix, α is the ﬁne structure constant, and ZP , v and γ are the charge, velocity and γ factor

the moving ion (γ = 1/√1

v2). This is the physically relevant ultrarelativistic potential

−

since it was obtained by ignoring terms in 1/γ2 [5] [4]. The b2 in the denominator of the

logarithm is removable by a gauge transformation, and if one wished to have a potential

with the same gauge for all impact parameters one would remove it. However, the freedom

to include or remove the extra b2 will be retained for possible computational convenience

2

and as a minimal test of gauge invariance.

It was suggested in Ref. [5] that the reduction of the interaction from three dimensions to

the two of Eq.(1) might make direct solution of the time-dependent Dirac equation, without

using coupled channels, a viable alternative for the calculations of pair production induced

by ultrarelativistic heavy ions. I point out in this Letter that, in fact, the delta function form

of Eq.(1) allows exact evaluation of the transition amplitudes for pair production without

using coupled channels. The form that the amplitudes take is that of perturbation theory,

but with a universal eﬀective interaction, modiﬁed from the the lowest order interaction to

exactly include coupling to all orders.

Ψ(r, t) is the exact four component time-dependent Dirac spinor solution, and for typo-

graphical simplicity the gauge explicitly shown is without the b2 in the denominator of the

logarithm.

In the usual coupled channels approach [2] one expands the solutions of Eq.(2) in a

time-independent basis of eigenfunctions of H0,

and then substitutes Eq.(4) into both left and right hand sides of Eq.(2) to obtain coupled

equations for the time-dependent amplitudes, aj

continuum. Pair production may be represented as a transition from an initial negative

continuum state to a ﬁnal bound or positive continuum electron state. How this scheme

preserves the Pauli principle for non-interacting electrons and how time reversal can be

exploited in these calculations has been previously discussed. [2]

The present treatment diﬀers from the usual coupled channels approach in that I sub-

stitute Eq.(4) only into the left hand side of Eq.(2). In the usual way, I then multiply both

sides by any particular state φf , and perform the spatial integration to obtain

since Eq.(10) trivially follows from it. We make use of Eq.(11) for the calculations since

the angular momentum algebra of the computer code makes use of the Legendre polynomial

series for the δ function [5] [4].

One now has a simple matrix element expression that is equivalent to the solution of

the full coupled channels problem with no truncation of basis. The full solution of the

problem, Eq.(11), is in perturbation theory form, but with a universal eﬀective interaction

In the conventional coupled channels method of calculating bound-electron positron pair

production one makes use of time reversal and makes the bound electron the initial state

[2]. Both positive and negative electron states are coupled. Since the rate of excitation

to negative continuum states is about three orders of magnitude smaller than to positive

excited electron states, one thereby also calculates the ionization probability for a single

bound electron. From Eq.(10) one may obtain in simple form the exact survival probability

In our previously reported large basis coupled channels calculations of bound-electron

positron pair production [3] we found about an overall non-perturbative enhancement of

7

2 barns over the 112 barn perturbation theory result for Pb + Pb at RHIC [6]. For

±

large contributing impact parameters we found a negligible non-perturbative enhancement.

For the smallest impact parameters our best truncated calculations showed non-perturbative

enhancement still on the order of a factor of two. Parallel calculations have now been carried

out using the present exact expressions. Results are presented in Table I. At every impact

parameter (except zero) the exact probability is smaller than the perturbation theory result.

Contrary to our previous result, the exact formalism yield a small suppression rather than

enhancement for the rate of bound-electron positron pair production due to non-perturbative

eﬀects. For a large set of ﬁnal states (corresponding to 61% of the perturbation theory

cross section) I ﬁnd the exact evaluation yields a cross section about 3 barns less than the

perturbation theory evaluation. The corresponding coupled channels calculation gave about

9 barns more than perturbation theory.

A calculation of exact amplitudes for excitation of an initial electron state into allowed

ﬁnal states should exhibit unitarity, which, of course, is absent in perturbation theory. To

demonstrate that there is no apparent violation of unitarity, calculations of single electron

ionization have been performed at various impact parameters. Results are shown in Table II.

Because of the huge low excitation energy contribution to ionization, the cuttoﬀ at

k

|

and E

16.8mec2 apparently covers a relatively greater part of the ionization cross section

≤

(about 90%) than the bound-electron positron cross section (61%). Note that at no impact

parameter does the sum of ﬁnal state bound and continuum probabilities exceed unity; the

6

10% of the continuum electron probability missing is presumably due to the cuttoﬀ in energy

and angular momentum, and is not inconsistent with a smooth extrapolation of

and E

to inﬁnity. To look at it another way, note that with the present method single electron

ionization cross sections can be can be calculated without even considering continuum wave

functions. One simply subtracts the sum of the ground state survival probability (column 2)

and the excited bound state probabilities (column 3) from unity at each impact parameter

to obtain the ionization probability at that impact parameter.

One might reasonably ask what is the physical reason that the exact probablilities are

less than those calculated in perturbation theory. For the ionization calculations the answer

is clearly unitarity:

in the limit of large αZP the sum of all perturbative probabilities

for transitions to excited states must eventually exceed unity. An exact calculation must

maintain conservation of probability. And although the sum of the perturbative bound-

electron positron probabilities is several orders of magnitude smaller, it too must violate

unitarity in the strong coupling limit.

But there is another aspect of the reaction that explains the failure of coupled chan-

nels to provide the correct sign of the correction to perturbation theory for bound-electron

positron production: the reaction is highly adiabatic. Figure 1 shows the time development

of the total ﬂux in ground state electron plus continuum positron states for a relatively

small atomic impact parameter (125 fm) where the time dependent ﬁeld is relatively strong.

The time-dependent component of the ﬁeld adiabatically excites and then deexcites bound-

electron positron pairs. There is a very delicate cancellation in the positive and negative

time contributions to the amplitudes. The exact probability (solid line) rises and falls sim-

ilarly with the perturbative probability (dashed line) but with a smaller magnitude. The

coupled channels calculation (dot-dashed line) has the smallest maximum of the curves (at

t = 0), but is the largest asymptotically. The coupled channels calculation was performed

using rather crude wave packets for the unbound negative and positive electrons [3]. The

exact and perturbative calculations were performed using continuum wave functions (heavy

lines) with the same calculations performed using corresponding wave packets shown in the

7

faint lines for comparison.

In a simple test of gauge invariance the exact calculation using continuum wave functions

apparently passes, but the corresponding calculation using wave packets is less successful.

Because the analytical Fourier series of the perturbative potential arises from the gauge

of Eq.(1), that gauge has been utilized in the calculations so far reported here (except, of

course, at b = 0). Thus to remove the b2 in the denominator of the logarithm, one must

add a corresponding scalar ln b2 term to the interaction. At large b the dominant term

of the Fourier series is of dipole form, ρ/b, leading to the 1/b2 falloﬀ of the probabilities.

But the ln b2 term added by the gauge transformation increases with b while the physical

dipole term decreases. Calculations have therefore been performed at b = 8000 fm to test

gauge invariance. With continuum wave functions the exact result shows a change from

1.036

10−6 to 1.062

10−6 under the gauge tranformation while the corresponding wave

×

×

packet results goes from 1.041

10−6 to 1.244

10−6. These results were calculated at a

×

×

mesh size of .025 with the diﬀerences in the two gauges dropping precipitously from those

calculated at our standard mesh of .05 in the continuum case but not in the wave packet

case. There is no surprise here. We would not expect calculations done with wave packets

to be exactly gauge invariant. The packet states are not exact eigenfunctions of the time-

independent hamiltonian H0 and there is a lack completeness. On the other hand, using

continuum wave functions, no disagreements inconsitent with expected numerical accuracy

were found between exploratory gauge transformed calculations and the results of Tables

I and II. For example, in the strong coupling impact parameter case of b = 125 fm the

ionization probability changes by 0.2% under the gauge transformation and the bound-

electron positron probability changes by 0.8% under the same transformation.

Apparently some combination of basis truncation and the necessity of using wave pack-

ets for continuum-continuum coupling provides an intractable limitation on the coupled

channels method, thereby making it incapable of adequate evaluation of the adiabatic can-

cellation. This failure of the coupled channels method in the ultrarelativistic limit makes

one question its utility even at more modest relativisitic energies, where the same properties

8

of adiabaticity, basis truncation, and wave packets remain.

The above exact method should have other applications in the future. The corresponding

perturbation theory cross section for continuum-electron positron pair production at RHIC

is about 30,000 barns. Non-perturbative calculations for this process have so far been pro-

hibitive in diﬃculty because of the large number of energy and angular momentum states

that are coupled. The present approach now seems to make the problem tractable. It al-

lows the exact cross section to be calculated for any particular electron-positron pair in an

expression decoupled from all the other pairs.

I am indebted to J. Weneser for discussion and for previous collaborative work that paved

the way for the present results.

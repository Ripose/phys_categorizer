The properties of photoassociation (PA) spectra near the intercombination line (the weak transition between
1S0 and 3P1 states) of group II atoms are theoretically investigated. As an example we have carried out a
calculation for Calcium atoms colliding at ultra low temperatures of 1 mK, 1 µK, and 1 nK. Unlike in most
current photoassociation spectroscopy the Doppler effect can signiﬁcantly affect the shape of the investigated
lines. Spectra are obtained using Ca–Ca and Ca–Ca∗ short-range ab initio potentials and long-range van der
Waals and resonance dipole potentials. The similar van der Waals coefﬁcients of ground 1S0+1S0 and excited
1S0+3P1 states cause the PA to differ greatly from those of strong, allowed transitions with resonant dipole
interactions. The density of spectral lines is lower, the Condon points are at relatively short range, and the
reﬂection approximation for the Franck-Condon factors is not applicable, and the spontaneous decay to bound
ground-state molecules is efﬁcient. Finally, the possibility of efﬁcient production of cold molecules is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

There is a growing interest

in the properties of cold
alkaline-earth atoms. One of the main reasons for this inter-
est is a possible construction of optical clocks, whose pre-
cision might exceed that of the current atomic standard of
time[1, 2]. In particular, optical clocks based on an intercom-
bination transition of alkaline-earth atoms are seen as good
candidates for the next time standard[3, 4, 5]. Increased accu-
racy of time standards is, for example, desired for the search
for a time-dependent variation of fundamental constants in
atomic experiments, which thereby would verify claims based
on astrophysical data[6].

The recent observation of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) in an Ytterbium gas[7] raises hopes for alkaline earth
atoms, which have similar electronic structure. Such achieve-
ment would allow a study of cold gasses over a wide range
of temperatures. Milli- and microkelvin temperatures are
reached by Doppler cooling on the 1S0–1P1 resonance and
the 1S0–3P1 intercombination line, respectively. Nanokelvin
temperatures are typical for Bose condensates and are reached
by evaporative cooling.

Another important reason for interest

in alkaline-earth
atoms is the absence of a nuclear spin in some isotopes. This
offers an unique opportunity towards a fundamental study of
Doppler cooling. Moreover, isotopes with zero and nonzero
nuclear spin allow a comparison of Doppler and sub-Doppler
cooling[8, 9]. The description of atom-atom interactions is
much simpler for a nuclear spin-less system. In fact, the basic
theory of photoassociation in strong laser ﬁelds[10, 11] might
be easier to conﬁrm in alkaline-earth gases than in alkali-metal
gases, where to date most of the research has been done.

Scattering of atoms in ground and excited states lead to a
collisional frequency shift that contributes to the error bud-
get of an optical clock. A Bose condensate crucially depends
on atom-atom collisions. Photoassociative (PA) spectroscopy
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16] is one of the most powerful tools to char-
acterize these scattering processes. It was developed after the

success of laser cooling of neutral atoms in the 1980’s [17].

We will focus our investigation on PA spectroscopy of ultra-
cold alkaline-earth atoms. In the presence of laser light, two
colliding ground-state atoms, labelled by the scattering state
“g”, absorb a photon forming an excited molecular bound
state “e”[16]. This process is called photoassociation. The
excited state decays to product states “p” leading to detectable
loss of atoms from an atomic trap. The variation of the atom
loss as a function of laser frequency gives the photoassocia-
tion spectrum. The shape of photoassociation lines not only
depends on the properties of the colliding atoms but also on
the temperature and other conditions in a trap[18].

Phoatoassociation spectra close to the resonance of the
1S0–1P1 transition in alkaline-earth atoms were theoretically
analyzed by Machholm et al. [19, 20] and others [21, 22].
Recently, Degenhardt et al. [23] measured the photoassocia-
tion spectra of cold calcium atoms near this transition at mK
temperatures. Takahashi et al. [24] used the photoassociation
spectroscopy to determined the scattering length of 174Yb.

This paper analyzes properties of photoassociation spectra
near the intercombination line, i.e. laser frequencies close to
the 1S0–3P1 transition. A dipole transition between pure sin-
glet and triplet states is forbidden. However, alkaline-earth
atom states labelled 3P1 are not pure triplet states and have
a small singlet component. This component mostly comes
from mixing with the nearby 1P1 state and give rise to a
weak dipole transition between the 1S0 and 3P1 state. Con-
sequently, the 1S0–3P1 atomic line has a small natural width.
As an example we have carried out calculations for calcium.
We describe the shape of photoassociation lines with very-
small natural width and weak laser radiation. The Doppler
effect as well as the photon recoil must be taken into ac-
count. This is in sharp contrast with the usual treatment of
PA[18] in which these two effects are neglected. Secondly,
we discuss possible patterns of vibrational levels in pho-
toassociation spectra near the intercombination line. Close-
coupled ro-vibrational bound states are obtained using an
interaction Hamiltonian, which is based on our electronic-

by ∆ = ¯hω

The description of photoassociation for very narrow lines
requires us to include two new effects. These effects are
the Doppler shift and the photon recoil. Figure 2 shows a
schematic of the collision before the PA process. In the lab-
oratory frame the two colliding atoms, each with mass m,
have momentum ~p1 and ~p2, respectively. In the coordinate
frame, which moves along with the center of mass, the rela-
tive momentum of the colliding atoms is ~pr and kinetic en-
ergy of relative motion εr(~pr) = p2
r/2µ, where µ = m/2
is the reduced mass of the colliding atoms. The photon en-
ergy ¯hω + εD( ~pc) in the moving frame is shifted with respect
to its energy ¯hω in the laboratory frame. To good approx-
imation the Doppler shift εD( ~pc) =
~pc/M is pro-
portional to pc, where ~pc is the center-of-mass momentum of
the two atoms in the laboratory frame. The total mass of the
system is M = 2m, ~klas is the wave vector of the laser ra-
diation with absolute value klas = ω/c, and c is the speed of
light. After photoassociation the excited molecule gains the
momentum ¯h~klas of the absorbed photon and, therefore, has
a translational kinetic energy of Erec,mol = ¯h2k2
las/(2M ) in
the moving frame deﬁned before the absorbtion of the pho-
ton. Consequently, photoassociation is most efﬁcient when

structure potentials[25] and recently calculated dispersion
coefﬁcients[26]. The Hamiltonian also includes coupling be-
tween 1P1 and metastable 3P0,1,2 states. The interatomic po-
tential between two ground state calcium atoms is relatively
well known[27]. It is shown that when the interaction in the
ground and excited state is similar the reﬂection approxima-
tion [10, 14, 28] cannot be applied to calculate the intensi-
ties of photoassociations lines. This is unlike photoassocia-
tion spectra near strongly allowed transitions, where the in-
teraction in the ground and excited states differs signiﬁcantly
and the reﬂection approximation is well satisﬁed. Finally, we
show that efﬁcient production of cold molecules in the ground
electronic state using photoassociation should be feasible.

II. SHAPE OF THE PHOTOASSOCIATION LINE

The photoassociation process occurs in a thermal cloud of
cold atoms at temperature T interacting with weak laser radi-
ation. After absorption of a photon of frequency ω, two atoms
form an excited molecular bound state
with energy Ee.
The photoassociation process according to standard descrip-
tions is most efﬁcient when the photon energy and the kinetic
energy of the relative motion of colliding atoms, εr, match the
energy of the excited bound state, that is ¯hω + εr = Ee.

which describes the efﬁciency of the process for a given laser
detuning, intensity I, and atom temperature. For clarity we
omit I as argument in the rate coefﬁcient. The rate coefﬁ-
cient K(∆, T ) is linear in the weak laser ﬁeld intensity I. For
higher intensities the center of the PA line shifts linearly with
I [10, 29, 30] and the width of the line increases. The descrip-
tion of the PA line shape presented in this work, for simplicity,
omits this shift as it can be neglected in the weak laser ﬁeld
regime.

The photoassociation trap-loss rate coefﬁcient involves a
thermal average of the rate coefﬁcient for a given pair of mo-
menta ~p1 and ~p2 in the laboratory frame. The momentum
distribution of both atoms is Maxwellian with temperature T .

Three limiting cases of the lineshape, Eq. (5), are of in-
terest. The shape of the line is Lorentzian when Γe is much
bigger than ∆D, ∆T , and Γeg(εr). The denominator of

then be pulled out of the integrals leading to a Lorentzian pro-
ﬁle with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to Γe.
Such a lineshape can be expected for strongly allowed tran-
sitions at ultra-low temperatures on the order of nanokelvins,
such as exist in Bose condensates [36, 37] [67].

L

In a second limiting case the shape of the line is a “cut-
off exponential”. This proﬁle can be obtained when ∆T is
much larger than ∆D and Γe and the energy dependence
[18]
of Γeg(εr) is neglected (compare discussion in Ref.
describ-
where the energy dependence Γeg(εr)

width at 1/e of the exponential lineshape equals the thermal

width ∆T . This lineshape is most easily observed at magneto-
optical trapping temperatures on the order of a millikelvin.

Finally, for the unusual situation of extremely weak tran-
sitions at nanokelvin temperatures one could try to achieve
conditions in which ∆D is much bigger than ∆T and Γe. In
such a case the Lorentzian can again be replaced by a delta
function but now with an argument that only depends on y
and ∆. The resulting lineshape is a Gaussian with half width
at 1/e of the maximum equal to ∆D.

In the usual treatment of the PA line shape Doppler broad-
ening is neglected. To ﬁnd conditions for which this ap-
proximation breaks down, the relative importance of Doppler
and thermal effects must be determined. It is easy to show
that ∆D = ∆T at temperature T = TR, where TR =
¯h2k2
las/(mkB) is the atomic recoil temperature. At temper-
atures T > TR thermal broadening dominates, while for
T < TR Doppler broadening can determine the shape of the
line. In fact, this requirement is not sufﬁcient. It is also neces-
sary to assume that the Doppler width is comparable or bigger
than Γe.

The inﬂuence of the photon recoil on the PA spectra is
to very good approximation described by an uniform shift,
Erec,mol, of all PA lines.
It should be noted that the pho-
ton recoil energy of the two-atom molecule is two times
smaller than the photon recoil energy of an isolated atom
Erec = ¯h2k2
las/(2m). This indicates that for molecular bound
states close to atomic levels there should exist a transition re-
gion from recoiling as a molecule to recoiling as an atom. Our
theory does not treat this effect and should only be applied to
molecular states with a binding energy that is much bigger
than the photon recoil energy.

III.

INTERATOMIC HAMILTONIAN

Properties of photoassociation spectra are governed by the
interactions between colliding atoms. The interaction Hamil-
tonian is described in appendix A and is similar to that dis-
cussed by Mies et al.[39] for the electronic structure and spec-
troscopy of Hg2. This Hamiltonian includes non-relativistic
Born-Oppenheimer potentials, the spin-orbit splitting of the
3P0,1,2 atomic states, relativistic coupling between 1P and
3P states, and a term that incorporates the rotation of the two
atom system.

The best possible Born-Oppenheimer potentials are used.
Ab initio calculations, with the exception of a few simple
cases, do not give sufﬁciently accurate predictions of abso-
lute positions of molecular bound states. Therefore theoreti-
cal potentials are used as initial guesses, and modiﬁed at short
interatomic separation to reproduce experimental binding en-
ergies. Unfortunately there is no experimental data on binding
energies near the 3P1 + 1S0 dissociation limit for the calcium
molecule. As the rovibrational structure is not known experi-
mentally, we can only map out possible spectra by varying the
short-range part of the potential.

The Born-Oppenheimer potentials have Hund’s case (a)

Relevant data about the interaction potentials between
alkaline-earth atoms in the ground and excited states have
been compiled by Kotochigova and Julienne [25]. The Ca2
potentials [25] are shown in Fig. 3. Czuchaj et al. [40] have
published a similar set of potentials. It is convenient to use
atomic units. The atomic unit of length 1 au = 1 a0 =
0.0529177 nm is equal to a Bohr radius a0 = ¯h2/(mee2); the
10−18 J is
atomic unit of energy 1 au = Eh = 4.3597482

The exited-state interaction potentials between calcium
atoms dissociating to the 1P1+1S0 and 3P0,1,2+1S0 limits for
short-range interatomic separations have been modelled using
the adiabatic 1,3Σ+
g,u and 1,3Πg,u potentials. These adiabatic
potentials are determined on the basis of ab initio calculations
of Ref. [25] and smoothly connected to their asymptotic func-
tional form. The form is C6/r6 for triplet states and C3/r3
for singlet states, respectively. Triplet potentials dissociate to
the 3P + 1S limits, while singlet potentials dissociate to the
1P + 1S limit.

In the model describing interaction of two calcium atoms
we do not include potentials correlating to 1D2 + 1S0 [41] and
3D1,2,3 + 1S0 dissociation limits. These potentials could give
rise to molecular bound states near the 3P1 + 1S0 limit, but the
sparse density of states makes it unlikely that such level occur
in a small energy interval close to the 3P1 + 1S0 dissociation
limit.

Dispersion coefﬁcients for two ground state atoms are
well known for many atomic species [27, 42, 43]. For ex-
cited atoms, however, there is little data. For a calcium

ing Ref. [39] we have C6(0+
g/u) = C6(3Πg/u), C6(1g/u) =
[C6(3Σg/u) + C6(3Πg/u)]/2, and, therefore, C6(3Σg/u) =
2724 au, C6(3Πg/u) = 2462 au. Derevianko and Porsev[26]
found that the splitting between the long-range Σ and Π po-
tentials is small. This small anisotropy for the quasi-two-
electron atom is qualitatively different from analytical predic-
tions for single-electron excited alkali-metal atoms interacting
with rare-gas atoms[44, 45]. Older data [46] does not agree
with the results of Ref. [26].

u (dark line) and 1u (light line) Hund’s case
(c) adiabatic potentials as a function of interatomic separation r. The
bound states of these potentials are indicated by the thick and thin
solid horizontal lines, respectively. The panel on the right shows the
corresponding photoassociation spectrum under typical conditions.
Each peak corresponds to a bound state in the left panel as indicated
by the dashed lines. Finally, the short dotted lines on the left side of
the graph indicate “bin edges” of the 0+

u potential.

toassociation of two ground state atoms can only excite the
ungerade states. Therefore, Fig. 3 only shows ungerade ex-
cited potential curves.

IV. RESULTS

Photoassociation spectra near the 3P1 + 1S0 limit are ex-
pected to be weak because the atomic transition dipole to the
intercombination line is nearly forbidden. As we will show,
such spectra can most easily be measured at ultracold temper-
atures on the order of µK and below. At these temperatures
only s-wave collisions will contribute to the spectrum. Conse-
quently, contributing transitions are between the ground ger-
ade scattering state,
, with total molecular

i
angular momentum Jg = lg = 0 and parity pg = 1, where lg
is the rotational angular momentum between the atoms, and
with Je = 1
excited ungerade bound states
and pe =
1. For total molecular angular momentum Jg = 0
and Je = 1 there are one and ﬁve coupled channels, respec-
tively (See Appendix A.). The excited-state channels for odd
Je and negative total parity pe do not include the 3P0 atomic
state and, therefore, the predissociation width Γe,dis in Eq. 4
is zero [68].

prediction of the bound-state locations. Therefore, we have
modiﬁed the short range of the 3Πu potential to demonstrate
how a spectrum can change. The 0+
u and 1u potentials corre-
late to the 3Πu and 3Σ+
u potentials at short range, respectively.
Consequently, by changing the 3Πu potential we can change
the location of the 0+
u bound states while leaving the position
of 1u bound states virtually unchanged. It is convenient to de-
ﬁne “bins” of the 0+
u potential as energy intervals with edges
marked by the 0+
u energy levels calculated with a 3Πu poten-
tial, such that the last bound state is exactly on the 3P1 + 1S0
threshold. As the short-range 3Πu potential is changed, there
is always exactly one 0+
u bound state in each bin. The “bin
edges” for 0+

u states are shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 5 shows PA spectra for two 3Πu potentials in or-
der to illustrate the limiting cases of overlapping and non-
overlapping 0+
u and 1u bands. The PA spectra are calculated
using the lineshape formula derived in the previous section
and take into account Doppler broadening. In both spectra the
last ﬁve vibrational levels of 0+
u and 1u symmetry are shown.
The PA rate coefﬁcient increases by nine orders of magnitude
near each vibrational level. Observable trap loss is on the or-
der of the 10−12 cm3s−1. In principle, ion detection allows
measurement of weaker PA lines than is possible with trap
loss. On the frequency scale of the ﬁgure the location of the
1u vibrational lines for the two potentials is almost the same.
u and 1u symmetry are
far apart from one another is shown in Fig. 5(a). In this case
the projection Ωe of the electronic angular momentum je on
the intermolecular axis is a good quantum number and bound
states can be labelled by the Hund’s case (c) coupling scheme.
This kind of spectrum has been observed in preliminary exper-
iments on Strontium near the 1S0–3P1 line by Ido and Katori
[50].

The rather small anisotropy of the long-range dispersion in-

within 5%) can lead to a near coincidence of 0+
u and 1u lev-
els over a range of v. Such a case is shown in Fig. 5(b). For
closely spaced doublets the projection Ωe is not a good quan-
tum number, and bound states should rather be labelled by the
rotational angular momentum le as in the Hund’s case (e) cou-
pling scheme. It can be clearly seen that in each doublet there
is a strong and weak line corresponding to le = 0 and le = 2,
respectively.

We have also studied the change in coupling scheme from
Hund’s case (c) to e for bound states very close to the molec-
ular thresholds. By changing the shape of the 3Πu poten-
tial, the last bound state, initially attributed to 0+
u symme-
try, smoothly approaches threshold. Simultaneously, the wave
function smoothly changes its character as well. For a binding
0.026 GHz 90% of the wave function has
energy ∆e/h =
−
Ωe = 0 character, while for ∆e/h =
0.003 GHz 90% of
the wave function can be attributed to le = 0. In other words,
Hund’s case (c) holds for binding energies larger than 0.026
GHz.

times ΓA(3P1) for the detunings shown in Fig. 5. We believe
that our simple model can not quantitatively describe the natu-
ral widths. The treatment of the coupling between 1P and 3P
states is not sufﬁciently accurate. For simplicity we assume
the same natural linewidth for all lines.

Figure 6 displays the collision-energy dependence of the
stimulated width Γeg(εr) for the 0+
u lines shown in Fig. 5(a).
The ground-state potential has a scattering length of 389.8 a0
and the laser intensity is 1 W/cm2. The width rapidly in-
creases for bound states closer to the threshold as the over-
lap of the bound and scattering wavefunction grows. More-
over, for collision energies smaller than εr/kB = 100 µK the
width of all lines is proportional to √εr, satisfying the Wigner
threshold law. For a 1 W/cm2 laser intensity and collision en-
ergies less than 1 µK the stimulated width for four of the vi-
brational levels is smaller than the natural width. Therefore,
the lines are unsaturated for most of lines shown in Fig. 5. The
exception are those lines closest to resonance.

In order to show the temperature dependence of the shape
of a line we have chosen line 2 of the 0+
u band in Fig. 5(a).
Figure 7 shows the lineshape for a temperature of 1 mK, 1
µK, and 1 nK with and without Doppler broadening. In the

tively. Proﬁles that include and do not include Doppler broadening

absence of Doppler broadening ∆D = 0 in Eq. 6. For these
three temperatures the thermal width ∆T /h = 20837 kHz,
20.8 kHz, and 0.021 kHz and the Doppler width ∆D/h =
694 kHz, 21.9 kHz, and 0.694 kHz, respectively.

At a temperature of 1 mK the line in Fig. 7(a) has the typical
“cut-off exponential” shape determined by thermal broaden-
ing and is only slightly affected by Doppler broadening. The
width of line is on the order of ten MHz and the peak rate co-
efﬁcient is 10−15 cm3s−1. Such a low rate coefﬁcient makes
trap loss hard to detect in typical ultra-cold-atom experiments
in a magneto-optical trap. In this case ion detection might be
a sensitive alternative.

A 1 µK atomic-gas temperature is close to the recoil tem-
perature TR = 1.11 µK. Under such conditions both thermal
and Doppler broadening in the PA lineshape are comparable.
Figure 7(b) demonstrates a signiﬁcant difference between a
Doppler broadened proﬁle and one without Doppler broaden-
ing. The width of the line is on the order of hundred kHz and
the peak rate coefﬁcient is 10−12 cm3s−1. A trap-loss signal
should be observable for such rate coefﬁcients.

In Fig. 7(c) a PA lineshape for a thermal gas at 1 nK is
shown. Typically for such low temperatures and sufﬁciently
high densities an atomic gas could be Bose condensed(BEC)
and a Boltzman distribution of atomic momentum should not
be used. Here, we assume a low enough density that conden-
sation has not occurred. The lineshape is an ordinary Voigt
proﬁle, which is determined by Doppler and natural broad-
ening. The natural width Γe,nat is 0.663 kHz. The line is
Lorentzian if Doppler broadening is neglected. The width
of the line is on the order of kHz and the peak rate coefﬁ-
cient is 10−10 cm3s−1. Moreover, the molecular recoil en-
ergy Erec,mol/h = 5.775 kHz is signiﬁcantly bigger than the
width of the line.

The width of the lines in Fig. 7 varies by four orders of
magnitude. The peak rate coefﬁcient changes by ﬁve orders of
magnitude. Clearly, for temperatures on the order of 1 µK and
below, photoassociation spectra should be observable. More-
over, Doppler broadening is an important factor and affects
the shape of the lines signiﬁcantly.

We have also analyzed the stimulated width of the 0+

u lines
as a function of the scattering length in the 1S0 +1 S0 ground
state and the binding energy ∆e of the excited 0+
u bound
states. The scattering length is varied within the range allowed
by experiment[27]. The scattering length is varied by slight
modiﬁcations of the short-range part of the ground-state po-
tential. The binding energy of the 0+
u bound states are changed
by modifying the 3Πu potential as discussed above.

Figure 8 shows the stimulated width at a collision energy
εr/kB = 1 µK as a function of ascat and ∆e. The ﬁg-
ure shows multiple nearly vertical dark structures, where the
width is nearly zero. There are two kinds of these structures:
ones accompanied by a parallel bright feature, where Γeg is
large, and those without. The latter structures are not quite
vertical for smaller ascat. The “ﬁrst kind” of structure occurs
when a 0+
u bound state coincides with a 1u bound state. This
mixing is independent of any ground state scattering property
and therefore the structures are vertical. The “second kind” of
dark structures occur when the overlap of the scattering wave-

function and the excited bound state vanishes. The shape of
the scattering wavefunction near the outer turning point of the
excited bound state does not change much when the scattering
length is on the order of a few hundred a0. Therefore, these
structures are nearly vertical. Near ascat = 300 a0 a departure
from vertical can be observed.

For photoassociation near strongly-allowed atomic tran-
sitions, such as occur in alkali-metal experiments[15, 18]
and near the 1P1 line of the alkaline earths[19], the overlap
vanishes for excited bound states with outer turning points
near the nodes of the ground-state wave function. Their
detuning ∆e can be found with the help of the reﬂection
approximation[14, 28], which says that the Franck-Condon
factor is proportional to the square of the ground state wave-
function at the position rC for which the difference in the ex-
cited and ground state potentials equals the photon frequency.
In our case the reﬂection approximation cannot be ap-
plied because the asymptotic potentials in the ground and ex-
cited state are similar. The ground-state wave function has
nodes at 26.5 au, 32.4 au, and 46.1 au for a scattering length
ascat = 389.8 au and a collision energy εr/kB = 1 µK.
For the reﬂection approximation the relation between detun-
ing and outer turning point of the excited bound states is de-
termined from a potential that is the sum of the Hund’s case
(c) potential V (0+
u ) and the rotational correction [2 + Je(Je +
1)]¯h2/(2µr2). The potential V (0+
u ) approaches the 3Πu po-
tential at large internuclear separation and Je = 1. These
ground state nodes correspond to outer turning points detun-
ings of

quantum number are related to the bins deﬁned in Fig. 4. This
discussion is not crucial for the main thrust of the paper and,
therefore, has been placed in an appendix. It, however, gives
a deeper understanding of the physics involved and is worth
presenting.

Finally, we have investigated the possibility of creating cold
molecules in the ground electronic state via the photoassoci-
ation process. The similar C6/r6 dependence of the ground
and excited potentials can make such a process more efﬁcient
than making ground state molecules through excited states in
which the asymptotic form of the potential is C3/r3. We have
calculated rates for bound-bound transitions between 0+
u ex-
cited states and 1Σ+
g ground states. From these rates we have
calculated the fraction of ground-state molecules, which af-
ter photoassociation are formed by natural decay. Figure 9
presents the fraction fge of molecules in rovibrational state
vg, Jg = 0 of the 1Σ+
g potential produced by natural decay of
rovibrational state ve, Je = 1 of 0+
u symmetry. The fraction
of a vg, Jg = 0 molecule is no more than 15%. For ve > 10
high vg vibrational levels of the ground state potential are pro-
duced, while for ve < 10 low vg levels are produced. Never-
theless, even for high ve a few percent of the ground-state
molecules have low vg. The fraction of molecules decaying to
Jg = 2 vibrational states of the 1Σg potential have also been
calculated, but are not shown. It was found that the fraction
of excited molecules decaying to the Jg = 2 vibrational states
is bigger than those decaying to the Jg = 0 vibrational states.
Rotational states with Jg = 1 do not exist because of Bose
symmetrization (See appendix A).

Adding the Jg = 0 and 2 fractions fge of molecules shows
that most of the spontaneous emission of a ve, Je 0+
u rovibra-
tional level goes to ground molecular bound states. In fact, for
ve < 19 more than 80% of the decay is to molecular states.
The only exception is the last vibrational level, ve = 19, cor-
responding to line 1 in Fig. 5(a), for which 30% of the decay is
to molecular states. We have also found that the spontaneous

decay rate of deeply-bound excited states can be one order of
magnitude larger than 2ΓA(3P1)/¯h.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a description for the shape of photoas-
sociation lines for weak transitions in which the natural width
is smaller than the Doppler width. The lineshape theory in-
cludes Doppler broadening and a photon recoil shift. It was
shown that the Doppler effect signiﬁcantly affects the PA line-
shape when the gas temperature is on the order of the recoil
temperature and below.

A model calculation for calcium has been carried out. It
is an example of photoassociation near the intercombination
line of alkaline-earth atoms. We ﬁnd that photoassociation
spectroscopy should be possible at calcium gas temperatures
on the order of µK and below. In addition, it was shown that
when the long-range potential of the ground and excited state
are similar, the reﬂection approximation [10, 14, 28] incor-
rectly estimates the stimulated width and strength of PA lines.
Finally, we have indicated that excited molecules are very
likely to decay to vibrational levels of the electronic ground
state. This can be used as an effective way to produce cold
molecules.

The collision between two ground state atoms can be solved
separately from that of a ground plus an excited state atom.
Moreover, for photoassociation of Ca we need scattering so-
lutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for ground state collisions
and bound states for ground-excited molecules.

For the collision of two ground-state atoms 1S0+1S0 there
is only a single channel for given Jg, Mg and pg. The chan-
nel is
with Sg = 0, Lg = 0,
jg = 0 and lg = Jg. The two 40Ca atoms are indistinguishable
bosons and, therefore, the wavefunction must be symmetric
under exchange of atoms and only channels with positive par-
ity p = +1 exist. Consequently, only even lg = 0, 2, 4, . . . are
allowed and the atoms interact on the gerade electronic state

we obtain the scattering wavefunction

For molecules formed by a ground- and excited-state atom

The ﬁrst two channels correspond to 1S0+3P1 states. There
are no channels with je = 0 and, since the atomic energies
satisfy EA(3P0) < EA(3P1) < EA(3P2), predissociation of
bound states below the 1S0 +3 P1 limit does not occur. In fact,
this is true for all odd Je and pe =

APPENDIX C: NEAR THRESHOLD VIBRATIONAL
QUANTUM NUMBER

−

Following LeRoy and Bernstein [60] the JWKB quan-
tum condition for the eigenvalues of energies E for a po-
tential V (r) is that Φ(E) = vπ where v is an inte-
ger and the phase Φ(E) = ΦJW KB(E)
π/2. Here
r2
r1 dr κ(E, r) is the semiclassical phase in-
ΦJW KB(E) =
tegral of κ(E, r) =
V (r))2µ/¯h calculated between
R
the classical turning points r1 and r2. This criterion is valid
for deeply bound states but breaks down near the dissocia-
tion limit[61]. It can be shown that for energies E close to
the threshold this condition still holds [62] if the phase Φ(E)
is modiﬁed in the following way: Φ(E) = ΦJW KB(E)
−

V (r) = Cq/rq. A recent discussion on improvements to the
LeRoy-Bernstein approach can be found in Ref. [63].

The phase Φ(E) allows us to deﬁne a generalized vibra-
tional quantum number as (Φ(E)
v0π)/π, a continuous
function of energy E, where v0 is an arbitrary constant, which
does not need to be an integer. For v0 = 0 the generalized vi-
1, or vmax when
brational quantum number is 0, 1, ... ,vmax −
E is equal to the energy of a bound state. Here, a zero value
corresponds to the most deeply bound state and vmax is the vi-
brational quantum number of the last bound state. At the dis-
sociation limit this generalized vibrational quantum number
equals vD = Φ(0)/π and, in general, can have a non-integer
value[60].

In the analysis of bound states near the threshold it is con-
venient to set v0 = vD or v0 = vmax + 1. In the ﬁrst case
the generalized vibrational quantum number is equal to zero
at threshold. Negative integers -1, -2, -3, ... correspond to en-
ergies that mark the edges of “bins”, in which there is exactly
one bound state. Only for integer vD, however, “bin edges”
coincide with bound state energies of the potential. In fact,
“bin edges” were introduced in this way in Fig. 4. A second
useful choice of v0 is v0 = vmax + 1.
It allows us to de-
ﬁne a near threshold vibrational quantum number, which has
values -1, -2, -3, ... for bound states counting from the top.
The near threshold vibrational quantum number for E = 0 is
vD −

1, and lies between -1 and 0.

as a function of the binding energy ∆e. The dashed lines indicate the
binding energies at which ν(∆e)/π is integer. The value of ν(∆e)/π
at ∆e = 0 is also indicated.

In practice, for energies far from threshold but not far
enough to justify the use of the JWKB approximation the en-
ergy dependence of the effective vibrational quantum num-
ber can be calculated using expressions given by Mies[64].
Following Refs. [64, 65] we deﬁne a near threshold vibra-
tional quantum number ν(E)/π as a continuous function of
energy E, where ν(E) is the phase difference between two
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation f (r) and φ(r) at the
equilibrium separation, re, of the potential V (r). The func-
tion f (r) is obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger equation as-
suming that f (0) = 0. The function φ(r) is obtained by solv-
ing the Schr¨odinger equation assuming that φ(
) = 0. Then
tan(ν(E)) can be calculated from [64]

(C1)

where the primes denote the ﬁrst derivative with respect to r.
The near threshold vibrational quantum number, deﬁned this
way, has an integer value for energies corresponding to the
bound states of the potential V (r).

A connection between the near threshold vibrational quan-
tum number and the binding energies ∆e of the multichannel
excited bound states, used in Fig. 8, can be made using quan-
tum defect theory[64]. The theory states that the shape of the
energy dependence of ν(E) near threshold is nearly indepen-
dent of the short-range form of the potential and that we can
replace the energy E in Eq. C1 by the binding energy ∆e.

The near threshold vibrational quantum number ν(∆e)/π

12

for a potential V (3Πu) + [2 + Je(Je + 1)]¯h2/(2µr2) as a
function of ∆e is shown in Fig. 10. For this potential the short
range shape is adjusted to obtain single-channel bound states
(or negative integer near threshold vibrational quantum num-
bers) for binding energies equal to -1.39 GHz, -8.71 GHz, -
25.56 GHz and -54.01 GHz. These values agree well with
the multi-channel “bin” edges -1.45 GHz, -8.75 GHz, -25.56

FIG. 11: The stimulated linewidth of the 0+

GHz and -53.94 GHz shown in Fig. 4. In fact, for binding en-
ergies below -0.026 GHz the multi-channel 0+
u bound states
are well approximated by this single-channel Hund’s case(c)
potential. The connection between integer ν(∆e)/π and the
multi-channel bin edges breaks down for smaller binding en-
ergies as Coriolis mixing changes the multi-channel coupling
scheme from Hund’s case (c) to (e). Since a single-channel
can not fully simulate the multi-channel bound states, the near
threshold vibrational quantum number ν(∆e)/π =
0.2135
is not integer for ∆e = 0.

−

Figure 11 shows the results of Fig. 8 in terms of the near
threshold vibrational quantum number ν(∆e)/π instead of the
binding energy ∆e. It is clearly seen from Fig. 11 that for
ν(∆e)/π between v and v + 1, where v =
2,
and thus for each corresponding bin a pair of dark structures
occurs. In fact, the “ﬁrst kind” of structure always appears at
nearly the same location within a bin. The “second kind” of
structure moves much more within a bin. Both observations
reﬂect the fact that the C6 coefﬁcients of the ground and exited
state potentials are similar.

[66] It implies a sum over all product states.
[67] In a condensate an extra factor of 1/2 appears in the rate coefﬁ-

cient expression [38].

[68] Excited bound states with even Je and negative parity can pre-
dissociate to a scattering state dissociating to the 3P0 + 1S0
limit. Such a level can only be excited from Jg = lg ≥ 2
ground scattering states and the excitation probability is negli-
gible at ultracold temperatures on the order of µK and below.

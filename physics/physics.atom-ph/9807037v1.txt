Abstract

We propose a novel method for guiding cold, neutral atoms using static magnetic
ﬁelds. A theoretical study of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a tube consisting of two
identical, interwound solenoids carrying equal but opposite currents is presented. This
ﬁeld is almost zero throughout the centre of the tube, but it increases with exponential
rapidity as one approaches the walls formed by the current carrying wires. Hence,
cold atoms passing through the tube may be reﬂected by magnetic mirror eﬀects near
the walls. Applying this technique to a free-falling cloud of magneto-optically cooled
caesium atoms we hope to construct atomic guides to facilitate the manipulation of
cold atomic beams.

1. Introduction

During recent years, with the advent of easily produced cold atomic sources, signiﬁcant
interest has been displayed in developing new and useful methods for manipulating and
controlling cooled atoms. This has resulted in the realisation of many atom optical elements
such as beam-splitters, mirrors and diﬀraction gratings. For a recent review on some of the
progress in this ﬁeld see, for example, ref. [1].

The majority of atom optical components rely on the eﬀects either of magnetic ﬁelds or
of light ﬁelds on neutral atoms. One clear example of this is shown by the diﬀerent types of
atomic mirrors which have successfully demonstrated atomic reﬂections. Permanent magnets
forming an array of alternating magnetic poles [2, 3], ferromagnetic surface mirrors made
from magnetic audio-tape [4] and current carrying wires arranged so that adjacent wires
have equal but opposite currents [5, 6] all rely on the interaction of the permanent atomic
magnetic dipole moment and a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld. An atom in an appropriate
magnetic state is repelled by the magnetic ﬁeld gradient. Specular reﬂection of thermal [7]
and laser-cooled [8] atoms from the repulsive potential of a blue-detuned evanescent light
wave has also been observed. This method is based on the interaction between an induced
atomic electric dipole moment and the non-uniform ﬁeld of an evanescent light wave [9].

A natural progression from the successful realisation of atomic mirrors has been the
development of atomic guides based on the diﬀerent reﬂection mechanisms. Until recently,
guides relying on atomic reﬂections by evanescent light ﬁelds within a hollow optical ﬁbre
[10 - 12] have been the main candidates in this ﬁeld. Several other guiding methods have
been proposed [13 - 16].

In this paper we propose an atomic guide based on the reﬂection of cold atoms by current
carrying wires. A suitable magnetic ﬁeld gradient can be produced by two interwound
solenoids carrying equal but opposite currents. We expect that such a guide will be more

1

adaptable to diﬀerent experimental studies than the transfer technique used in [16], mainly
due to the fact that it can be positioned very close to the MOT by placing it inside the
vacuum chamber. Losses due to trap expansion are therefore minimised. When the MOT is
operating the current through the guide can be switched oﬀ and there will be no distorting
eﬀects on the trap. This is in stark contrast to guide designs based on permanent magnets.
The following sections present the concept behind the magnetic guide and the magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration to be used.

2. The magnetic guide

Let us consider the interaction between atoms with an atomic magnetic dipole moment,
µ, and a static inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, B. In this case, the interaction potential is
position dependent. We shall assume adiabaticity for the particular case of slowly moving,
laser-cooled atoms. In other words, we assume that the projection of the atomic angular
momentum onto the magnetic ﬁeld direction remains constant during the atom-magnetic
ﬁeld interaction. The force on the laser-cooled atoms in the presence of the B-ﬁeld is given
by

F = ∇(µ · B) = −mgF µB ∇B ,

(1)

where m is the magnetic quantum number, gF is the Land´e g-factor and µB is the Bohr
magneton. From eq. (1) we see that the atoms will be repelled by an increasing magnetic
ﬁeld gradient when the product mgF is positive. This is the main principle behind magnetic
mirrors.

As has been mentioned in the previous section, an eﬀective and eﬃcient type of mirror
for cold, neutral atoms can be produced by reﬂection from a magnetic surface. Free-falling,
laser-cooled caesium atoms pumped into the m = +4 hyperﬁne state have already been
reﬂected from an atom mirror consisting of an array of current carrying wires, with the
current in adjacent wires being equal but opposite in direction [6] as shown in ﬁg. 1(a).

If we now consider an extension of this study, we can eﬀectively imagine bending the
wire array mentioned previously, in order to form a tube through which the atoms can pass.
Each wire from the array now forms a current loop and this is represented schematically
in ﬁg. 1(b). The current in each loop is equal and the currents in two adjacent loops are
in opposite directions. This design results in the atoms being reﬂected irrespective of the
path they follow through the tube. The reﬂections cause the atoms to be trapped inside the
tube rather than being absorbed on the walls. Therefore, the tube forms an atomic guide.
A tube formed by adjacent current loops, as shown in ﬁg. 1(b), can be approximated by
two interwound solenoids. In the next section we will discuss the magnetic ﬁeld of such an
arrangement and show that it provides us with appropriate conditions for constructing an
atomic guide. Theoretical magnetic ﬁeld plots for our particular experimental conditions
will also be presented.

3. Magnetic ﬁelds of helical solenoids

An expression for the magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely long solenoid can be found by exploiting
its helical symmetries. Although these calculations are tedious to perform, the ﬁnal result
shows a deﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld structure beyond that obtained via the usual elementary
calculation based on Amp`ere’s circuital law and the current sheet approximation.

2

Let us consider a solenoid of radius R and let a be the distance between adjacent wires
in the z-direction, i.e. along the long axis of the solenoid. Note that a is the reciprocal of
the number of turns of wire per unit length. The path of the wire wound in the solenoidal
coil is given by r = R, φ = 2πν and z = z0 + aν in cylindrical coordinates. ν is a continuous
parameter describing the number of turns of wire as counted from an arbitrary starting
point, z = z0. We are particularly interested in the magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid (i.e.
where r < R). It can be shown that the magnetic ﬁeld components, (Br, Bφ, Bz), are given
by the following expressions [17]:

By deﬁnition, ρ0 ≡ 2πnR/a and ρ ≡ 2πnr/a. I is the current in the solenoid and z0 is an
arbitrary point along the z-axis through which the wire passes. The Kn(ρ) and the In(ρ)
are modiﬁed Bessel functions. The primes on the Kn and In indicate diﬀerentiation with
respect to ρ.

In order to construct an atomic mirror, we know that we need an array of wires such that
adjacent wires carry equal but opposite current. Extending this to the idea of an atomic
guide it seems reasonable that two interwound solenoids will give us the correct magnetic
ﬁeld gradient to produce atomic reﬂections in all directions (c.f. ﬁg. 1). Each solenoid is
a single wire solenoid of radius R and distance a between adjacent turns of wire. The two
solenoids must also carry equal but opposite currents. This is treated mathematically by
giving each solenoid a diﬀerent reference point (0, 0, z0) through which the wires pass. For
one solenoid we take the current to be I and z0 = 0 and for the second coil the current
is −I and z0 = a/2. Using eqs. (2), (3) and (4) we can easily obtain the solutions for the
magnetic ﬁeld B produced by the double wound solenoid. We are again interested in the
ﬁeld inside the tube formed by the two solenoids (i.e. where r < R). The magnetic ﬁeld
components are given by

4. Magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles

Figure 2(a) shows a vertical slice (i.e. along the z -axis) of the magnetic tube formed by the
two solenoids. The magnetic ﬁeld is calculated using eqs. (5), (6) and (7) and considering the
ﬁrst 10 terms of the Fourier series only. In this example, we have assumed that a/R = 1.0
and that a current of 0.5Amps ﬂows through each solenoid. The ﬁeld inside the tube is
close to zero throughout the central region. This is identical to the result predicted using
Amp`ere’s circuital law for two interwound solenoids. However, there is a large magnetic
ﬁeld gradient as one approaches the wires. Figure 2(b) is a horizontal view of the magnetic
ﬁeld (z = 0 plane), using the same parameters as in ﬁg. 2(a). Free-falling, cold atoms enter
the tube normal to the plane of the diagram. Any oﬀ-axis atoms will experience a steep
ﬁeld gradient near the walls and will be reﬂected back towards the centre. It is important
that the magnetic force is large enough so that the atoms in the ballistically expanding
cloud never quite reach the walls of the tube. This ensures that they will be reﬂected before
striking the wires and thus, a high transport eﬃciency can be obtained for the guide, due
to the low loss in ﬂux from absorption.

Similar plots of the B-ﬁeld are shown in ﬁg. 3. In this case, the solenoids are more
tightly wound than in ﬁg. 2 so that a/R = 0.1. Again, we assume a current of 0.5Amps.
Using these parameters we see that the magnetic ﬁeld remains essentially uniform over a
larger region than that shown in ﬁg. 2. However, the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is steeper and
a higher eﬃciency of reﬂection should be obtained.

5. Design criteria

Ultra-high vacuum compatible, Kapton-coated wires of maximum diameter 0.86mm are
suitable for making the magnetic guide. Considering an atom guide of radius 2.5mm this
yields a/R = 0.69, which lies within the range we have studied. A typical transverse velocity
for trapped Cs atoms is ±6cm/s. Let us assume that the entrance to the atom guide is
located 1.5cm beneath the centre of the trapped cloud of atoms and the guide is 3.8cm long.
Once the trap is switched oﬀ, we predict that 67% of the free-falling atoms will enter the
guide. 45% of these atoms will strike the walls of the guide and be reﬂected. The other
55% of atoms will fall straight through. A longer guide would reﬂect a higher percentage of
atoms. Figure 4 is a plot of the current needed to reﬂect atoms from the walls of the guide
versus the distance from the centre of the tube at which the atoms will be reﬂected. From
this graph we see that atoms close to the walls (2.2mm from the centre) require a current of
approximately 0.1Amps to be reﬂected. Our practical limit of 0.5Amps is therefore largely
suﬃcient.

We have presented a new scheme for constructing atomic guides, based on the reﬂection of
cold atoms from current carrying wires. Magnetic mirrors consisting of a current carrying
wire array have already been realised [6]. Our guide scheme is an extension of this technique.
A suitable magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration for the guide consists of two interwound solenoids.
This magnetic atom guide has a zero-ﬁeld region along its axis and a steep ﬁeld gradient as
one approaches the walls radially from the centre. In order to avoid non-adiabatic spin-ﬂips

6. Conclusion

in the zero region of the B-ﬁeld, it may be necessary to add a small bias ﬁeld to the overall
conﬁguration by unbalancing the currents in the two solenoids by a small amount.

This magnetic guide design has a distinct advantage over other guiding schemes [11, 12,
15] since it doesn’t require additional lasers and is, therefore, very cost eﬀective and simple
in construction. Because it is based on current carrying wires it can be switched on and oﬀ
as required. Therefore its entrance can be positioned close to the MOT. Any constraints on
the distance between the MOT and the atom guide arise from the diameter of the trapping
laser beams and the radius of the guide itself. Therefore, by a judicious choice of these
two parameters, the free-falling cloud of cold atoms should not expand appreciably before
entering the magnetic tube. The entire experiment should be switched so that the MOT is
on when the magnetic guide is oﬀ and vice versa and the guide should be switched on after
the atoms have entered it. This avoids any problems that may arise from heat dissipation
and distorting eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁelds.

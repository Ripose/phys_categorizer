Abstract
The diﬀusion radius of the 1S muonic hydrogen atoms in gaseous H2 targets with various deu-
terium admixtures has been determined for temperatures T = 30 and 300 K. The Monte Carlo
calculations have been performed using the partial diﬀerential cross sections for pµ and dµ atom
scattering from the molecules H2, HD and D2. These cross sections include hyperﬁne transitions
in the muonic atoms, the muon exchange between the nuclei p and d, and rotational-vibrational
transitions in the target molecules. The Monte Carlo results have been used for preparing the
time-projection chamber for the high-precision measurement of the nuclear µ− capture in the
ground-state pµ atom, which is now underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute.

Theoretical studies of the muonic atom diﬀusion in molecular hydrogen-isotope targets
are important for many experiments in low-energy muon physics. In particular, knowledge
of the diﬀusion radius of muonic hydrogen atoms in gaseous H-D targets is required for
investigations of the µ− nuclear capture in the pµ and dµ atoms created in H-D targets. The
diﬀusion radius Rdiﬀ is deﬁned as the distance between the point of the muon stop in H-D
and the point of the muonic atom disappearance due to the muon decay or to the muon
nuclear capture. Since the µ− capture rate on p or d is several orders of magnitude lower than
the muon decay rate, Rdiﬀ is practically determined by the point of the muon decay. A high-
precision measurement of the rate Λs for the muon capture pµ
νµ + n in the ground-state
pµ atom (MuCap experiment) is underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute [1, 2, 3, 4]. The
rate Λs for the singlet state F = 0 of the total muonic atom spin F is sensitive to the weak
form factors of the nucleon, especially to the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant gP .
As a result, this experiment will provide a rigorous test of theoretical predictions based
on the Standard Model and low-energy eﬀective theories of QCD [5, 6]. A high-precision
measurement of the µ− capture rate in the process dµ
νµ + n + n is under consideration
by the MuCap collaboration [3]. Such an experiment would be uniquely suited to study the
axial meson exchange currents in the two-nucleon system.

In this paper, main results of the Monte Carlo simulations for determining the optimal
conditions for the MuCap experiment are presented. The time-projection chamber is ﬁlled
with almost pure H2 gas which, however, contains a very small D2 contamination. In the
isotope exchange process pµ + d
dµ + p, the energy of about 135 eV is released in the
centre-of-mass system. Therefore, the created dµ atom gains the collision energy of a few
tens eV. As a result, the diﬀusion radius is signiﬁcantly enlarged. This leads to an en-
hanced absorption of the muons in the time-projection-chamber walls and limits the spatial
resolution. The determination of the highest acceptable D2 contamination has been one of
the aims of the presented simulations. Since the capture rate Λs depends strongly on the
total pµ spin, it is necessary to calculate the time evolution of the population of the pµ
spin states. The initial distribution of the spin states F = 1 and F = 0 is statistical. The
simulations have been performed for the target temperatures T = 30 and 300 K. The target
density has been ﬁxed at the constant value φ = 0.01 (relative to the liquid hydrogen den-
1022 atoms/cm3), which corresponds to the pressure of about 9 bar at 300 K.
sity of 4.25
At such a density, the probability of formation of the muonic molecule ppµ is small.
In
higher-density targets, the muon nuclear capture inside ppµ is signiﬁcant. This leads to
serious problems with interpreting the experimental data owing to inaccuracy of the rate
for the ortho-para conversion of the ppµ molecules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The spin-ﬂip transition
pµ(F = 0) + p due to the muon exchange between the protons is still
pµ(F = 1) + p
0.01 to ensure a fast quenching of the higher hyperﬁne state F = 1
suﬃciently strong at φ
≈
and, therefore, an unambiguous Λs measurement.

The Monte Carlo kinetics code includes the muon decay, pµ and dµ scattering from
the molecules H2, HD and D2, and formation of the molecules ppµ, pdµ and ddµ. In the
scattering process, the atoms can change their spin states. The isotope exchange reaction
pµ + d
dµ + p in pµ scattering from HD and D2 is taken into account. Also, all possible
rotational and vibrational transitions in the target molecules are included. At the collision
energies ε . 10 eV (in the laboratory system), the scattering processes are described using
the diﬀerential cross sections dσ/dΩ for scattering from the hydrogenic molecules [7, 8]
(“molecular” cross sections). At higher energies, eﬀects of the molecular binding and electron
screening can be neglected and, therefore, the diﬀerential cross sections for the muonic atom

diﬀerences between the molecular and nuclear cross sections at ε . 1 eV are due to molecular-

combinations of the three hydrogen isotopes are presented in ref [13].

The time evolution of the hyperﬁne states, the energy distribution of the muonic atoms,
and the radial distribution of the muon decays were calculated for various initial conditions.
All the presented results are given for a ﬁxed target density ϕ = 0.01. The initial distribution
of the pµ or dµ kinetic energy was described by the two Maxwell components: thermal (50%)
and energetic (50%) with the mean energy εavg = 1–5 eV, according to the experimental
results [14, 15]. The calculated time evolution of the F = 0 state and of the mean pµ(F = 0)
kinetic energy are shown in ﬁg. 2, for a pure H2 at T = 300 K. The pµ atoms starting at
ε
1 eV are slowed down within a few tens ns to energies where the spin-ﬂip transitions

the pµ + p centre-of-mass system. After this time, the F = 1 state disappears with a time
constant of 6 ns. Hence, about 50 ns after the muon stop, the relative population of the
F = 1 state is below 0.01 and the measurement is no longer distorted by the population
of the upper hyperﬁne level. All that takes place when most of the initially energetic
atoms remains epithermal (ε
kBT , where kB is the Boltzmann constant). The pµ(F = 0)
thermalization from ε
0.1 eV takes about 400 ns. As it is illustrated in ﬁg. 3, the pµ(F = 0)
energy spectrum is epithermal for times much longer than in the case of pµ(F = 1) atoms.

FIG. 3: Energy distribution of pµ(F = 0) and pµ(F = 1) atoms in a H2 gas at T = 300 K, for
several moments after the muon stop.

Only after the total deexcitation of the F = 1 level, the pµ(F = 0) energy distribution takes
the ﬁnal Maxwellian form with εavg = 0.04 eV. Most of the pµ diﬀusion until the muon
decay takes place after the system has been thermalized.

The mean diﬀusion range, which is important for the optimisation of the pressure and
temperature of H2 ﬁlling the time-projection chamber, equals about 1 mm. However, long-
lived (t & 10 µs) muons travel much farther, which limits the reachable spatial resolution.
Figure 4 shows the fraction of the muon decays outside the diﬀusion radius from the point
of pµ formation, for the target temperature of 30 and 300 K. The thermal diﬀusion is
signiﬁcantly reduced at 30 K. This eﬀect is, however, limited because of the above-mentioned
pµ acceleration in the spin-ﬂip process. The radial distribution of the muon decays for several
time intervals is plotted in ﬁg. 5.

The calculated values of the mean diﬀusion radius for a pure H2 target at φ = 0.01 are
summarised in table I. The results are given for T = 30 and 300 K. The realistic two-
Maxwell distributions of the initial pµ energies have been used. Also, the thermalized initial
distributions of pµ atoms with the depleted F = 1 state have been employed in order to
investigate the thermal part of the diﬀusion.

A real H2 target always contains a certain admixture of deuterium. Figure 6 demonstrates
that the maximal muonic atom diﬀusion radius is greatly increased when the deuterium

distribution of the muon decays is due to very energetic (
pµ collisions with deuterons. These dµ atoms can travel at large distances owing to the
deep Ramsauer-Townsend minimum in the dµ + p cross section (see ﬁg. 1). Therefore, it
is crucial to reduce the deuterium concentration to a very low level of about 10−7–10−6.

and 300 K and ϕ = 0.01. The mean value of Rdiﬀ is smaller (0.80 mm at 300 K and 0.65 mm
at 30 K, for the time interval 0–5 µs) than in the pure H2 case since the elastic dµ(F = 1
2) + d
and dµ(F = 3
2 ) + d cross sections are larger than the elastic pµ(F = 0) + p cross section [9].
Moreover, the hyperﬁne splitting for dµ is ∆Ehfs
dµ = 0.0495 eV. As a result, there is practically
no spin-ﬂip acceleration of dµ atoms at 300 K. A relatively weaker acceleration, compared
to the pµ + H2 case, takes place at 30 K.

The Monte Carlo results can be compared with a simple analytical estimation. The
kinetic theory of gases gives the following mean diﬀusion radius Rdiﬀ as a function of time:

in which D denotes the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. It is assumed that the atom survives until the
time t. Using the standard deﬁnitions from the kinetic theory of gases:

where v is the mean atom velocity, L is the mean free path, σ stands for the total cross
section and N is the number density of atoms, one has

atom scattering from hydrogenic molecules is strongly anisotropic. Therefore, we use the
following approximation:

where σtran is the transport cross section (1) averaged over the thermal motion of the muonic
atoms and of the target molecules. Taking into account the muon lifetime τ0 = 2.2 µs, we

Carlo results calculated assuming the thermal initial distribution of pµ energies and zero
population of the F = 1 state (see the third column in table I). In the real case, the diﬀusion
radius is larger owing to the epithermal diﬀusion. Let us note that it is very important to use
the molecular diﬀerential cross sections for a correct Monte Carlo simulation of the thermal
part of the diﬀusion. The diﬀusion radius in H2 occurs to be about two times smaller than
in the case when the corresponding nuclear cross sections are used.

In conclusion, it has been shown that the optimal conditions for studies of the µ− capture
on the proton inside the ground-state pµ(F = 0) atom are achieved at the target density
0.01 when the concentration of the deuterium is depleted to the level of 10−7–10−6. The
φ
mean diﬀusion radius of the muonic atoms at these conditions is on the order of 1 mm. It can
be signiﬁcantly lowered when the target temperature is decreased from 300 K to 30 K. This
eﬀect is, however, limited as a fraction of the pµ(F = 0) atoms is epithermal both due to the
initial high-energy component and to the deexcitation of the F = 1 states. The simulations
of the muon capture experiments require using the diﬀerential cross sections for the muonic
atom scattering from hydrogenic molecules. This is caused by strong molecular-binding and
electron-screening eﬀects at the collision energies below a few eV, where the main stage of
the diﬀusion process takes place.

Enhanced eﬀect of temporal variation of the ﬁne structure constant in diatomic
molecules

We show that the relative eﬀect of variation of the ﬁne structure constant in microwave transitions
between very close and narrow rotational-hyperﬁne levels may be enhanced 2-3 orders of magnitude
in diatomic molecules like LaS, LaO, LuS, LuO, YbF ,etc. The enhancement is result of cancellation
between the hyperﬁne and rotational intervals.

The possible variation of the fundamental constants of
Nature is currently a very popular research topic. There
are hints for the variation of the ﬁne structure constant,
α = e2/¯hc, and strong interaction in Big Bang nucle-
osynthesis, quasar absorption spectra and Oklo natural
nuclear reactor data. A very sensitive method to study
the variation in a laboratory consist in comparison of dif-
ferent optical and microwave atomic clocks. An enhance-
ment of the relative eﬀect of α variation can be obtained
in transition between the almost degenerate levels in Dy
atom [1]. These levels move in opposite directions if α
varies. An experiment is currently underway to place
limits on α variation using this transition [2]. Unfortu-
nately, one of the levels has a quite large linewidth and
this limits the accuracy.

In this paper I would like to note that very close nar-
row levels exist in diatomic molecules. In the work [3]
we suggested to use such levels to enhance eﬀects of par-
ity violation. Below I will show that there is also an
enhancement of α variation in transition between such
levels.

Consider, for example, the molecule 139La32S (or LaO,
LuO, LuS, YbF, etc). The electron ground state of this
molecule is 2Σ. The rotational-hyperﬁne levels are char-
acterized by the total angular momentum J = L + F,
rotational angular momentum L, F = I + S, nuclear
spin I and electron spin S. The interval between the
rotational-hyperﬁne levels |L = 1, F = 4, J > and
|L = 2, F = 3, J ′ > is zero within the experimental ac-
curacy (about 0.01 cm−1, see all data in [4]). This is
a result of the cancellation between the rotational inter-
val B[L1(L1 + 1) − L2(L2 + 1)] (B=0.11693 cm−1) and
the hyperﬁne interval 4b (4b=0.47 cm−1); the transition
frequency is ω = 4b − 4B = 0.002 ± 0.01 cm−1.

The hyperﬁne structure constant can be presented in

the following form

b = const × [

The factor in the ﬁrst bracket is an atomic unit of en-
ergy. The second “electromagnetic” bracket determines
the dependence on α. An approximate expression for the
relativistic correction factor (Casimir factor) for s-wave
electron is the following

where γ = p1 − (Zα)2, Z is the nuclear charge. Varia-
tion of α leads to the following variation of Frel [5]:

More accurate numerical many-body calculations [1] of
the dependence of the hyperﬁne structure on α have
shown that the coeﬃcient K is slightly larger than that
given by this formula. For Cs (Z=55) K= 0.83 (instead
of 0.74), for Hg+ K=2.28 (instead of 2.18). The last
bracket in eq.
(1) contains the dimensionless nuclear
magnetic moment µ in nuclear magnetons ( the nuclear
magnetic moment M = µ e¯h
2mpc ), electron mass me and
proton mass mp. The dependence of µ on the dimen-
sionless strong interaction parameter X = mq/ΛQCD has
[6]. Here mq is the quark mass
been calculated in Ref.
and ΛQCD is the strong interaction scale.

The rotational constant can be presented in the follow-

ing form

B = const × [

¯h2 ][

]

Then the relative variation of the transition frequency is
approximately equal to

δω

For La (Z=57) K = 0.9 and β < 0.1. For a numerical es-
timate we can assume the central value for the frequency,
ω = 4b − 4B = 0.002 cm−1. Then we have

δω

The accurate value can be obtained after the frequency
ω will be measured. Thus in molecular experiments one
can have two-three orders of magnitude enhancement of
the sensitivity to the α variation.

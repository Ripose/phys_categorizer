Abstract

A brief review is presented of the stability domain of three- and four-
charge ground-states when the constituent masses vary. Rigorous re-
sults are presented, based on the scaling behavior and the convexity
properties deduced from the variational principle. They are supple-
mented by accurate numerical computations.

1 Three unit-charge systems

Beyond hydrogenic atoms, the simplest systems in molecular physics consist
of three unit charges, ±(+1, −1, −1). The Hamiltonian reads

H =

A non-relativistic point-charge interaction is assumed, and everything else
is neglected: relativistic corrections, ﬁnite-size eﬀects, annihilation, strong
interaction, etc.

Nevertheless, as pointed out by Thirring [1], it is not completely obvious
why some systems are stable, e.g., H+
2 = (p, p, e−), Ps− = (e+, e−, e−) or
H− = (p, e−, e−), while others, such as (p, ¯p, e−) or (e−, p, e+), immediately
dissociate into a neutral atom and an isolated charge.

One can use the scaling properties of (1) and similar Hamiltonians to
choose ¯h = e2 = 1, as well as
αi = 1, where αi = 1/mi is the inverse
mass of particle i. It is natural to use inverse masses, as the Hamiltonian
αi = 1 is reminiscent of energy
depends linearly upon them. The condition
conservation in three-body decays, any possible conﬁguration of which can be
represented in a “Dalitz plot”, which is an equilateral triangle of unit height.
Each inverse mass is read as the distance to a side, as shown in Fig. 1.

stability domain.

Initially, some incorrect results where obtained for these systems, though
these were sometimes based on very astute reasoning. It is, indeed, a more

Stability of three- and four-charge systems

delicate operation to estimate numerically where the stability frontier is than
to calculate the binding energy of a system whose stability is well established.
Recent numerical calculations are, however, very accurate and reliable. See,
e.g, Refs. [2, 3, 4] for some examples and the results in the literature, and
Ref. [5] for a comprehensive survey.
If one summarizes the results of the
literature, one ﬁnds that the stable conﬁgurations belong to a band around
the symmetry axis m2 = m3 where like-sign charges bear the same mass.

The shape of the stability domain, as schematically pictured in Fig. 2,

results from three basic properties [6]:

1. Any state along the symmetry axis is stable. This was shown by Hill

[7] using the trial wave function

Ψ = exp (−ar12 − br13) + {a ↔ b} ,

(2)

where the possibility of having a 6= b is crucial, as already noted
by Chandrasekhar [8] for H− and Hylleraas [9] for Ps−. Note that
if a wave function with only an adjustable eﬀective charge Ze, i.e.,
Ψ ∝ exp(−Ze(r12 + r13)), or even more generally, any factorized wave
function f (r12)f (r13) is used, it is not possible to demonstrate the sta-
bility of H− [10]; one needs the anticorrelation a 6= b, or an explicit r23
dependence, or both.

2. Each instability region is convex. This results from the convexity prop-
erties of the ground-state energy, after suitable rescaling such that the
threshold energy E(m+
3 ) on the other side) is kept
constant.

2 ) (or E(m+

1 , m−

1 , m−

3. Each instability region has as a star shape with respect to A2 or A3.
For instance, if one draws a line from A3 toward the symmetry axis, it
corresponds, after rescaling, to increasing m3 while the threshold energy
E(m+
2 ) remains constant. Increasing m3 decreases the three-body
binding energy and thus improves stability.

1 , m−

An application of this approach can be made when searching the critical

masses for which stability disappears, for instance,

α : (m+

α , ∞−, 1−) β : (∞+, m−

β , 1−) γ : (1+, m−

γ , 1−) .

(3)

In Fig. 3, one can see that a safe (lower) bound on mα and a safe (upper)
bound on mβ result in a straight line entirely in an instability domain. It

intersects at γ′ the m1 = m3 axis, this providing a upper bound for the
critical mass mγ, which turns out to be better [6] than the limits obtained by
direct studies of the particular conﬁgurations (1+, m−, 1−). In other words,
global considerations on the triangle of stability are sometimes more powerful
than local studies.

Stability of three- and four-charge systems

The lowest threshold consists of either two atoms or one three-body ion
and an isolated charge. The lowest two-atom state is obtained by combining
the heaviest of the positive charges m1 and m2 with the heaviest of the
negative charges m3 and m4, and allowing the two lightest masses to form
a second atom. This can be seen explicitly from the Bohr formula, but this
is a more general results for any given potential, as shown in Refs. [11, 12].
If for instance the ﬁrst three particles are heavy and form a stable ion, then
the lowest threshold is (m+
4 . As the ion attracts the last
charge with a potential that is asymptotically attractive and Coulombic, and
thus supports many bound states, one is sure in such situation that the four-
body system is stable. In practice, stability is guaranteed by ﬁnding a wave
function whose expectation value for H is smaller than the energy of the
lowest two-atom threshold.

For the equal-mass case, i.e., the positronium molecule Ps2, this was done
in 1947 by Hylleraas and Ore [13]. Later on, it was realized that the stability
of Ps2 implies that of all hydrogen-like conﬁgurations (M +, M +, m−, m−),
∀M/m. This includes the ordinary hydrogen molecule, starting from M =
m, instead of the usual (and more natural) M → ∞ limit of the Born–
Oppenheimer–Heitler–London treatment. The reasoning, made indepen-
dently by Adamowski et al. [14] and in Ref. [15], is reminiscent of the well-
known argument that if an even Hamiltonian, say heven = p2 + x2, is sup-
plemented by an odd term hodd, then the ground state is lowered. This is
seen explicitly if hodd = x, but the general result follows simply from the
variational principle applied to heven + hodd using the even ground-state of
heven as trial wave function. Here, parity is replaced by charge conjugation,
and the (M +, M +, m−, m−) Hamiltonian is rewritten as

H = Heven + Hodd =

The full Hamiltonian H has a lower ground-state than its even part Heven,
which is nothing but a rescaled version of the Ps2 case. The nice feature is
that H and Heven have the same threshold, since when one computes the two-
body energy, one ﬁrst averages the inverse masses M −1 and m−1 to calculate
the reduced mass.

Once the binding energy of (M +, M +, m−, m−) is given, then minimal
extensions of the stability domain beyond the line {m1 = m2, m3 = m4} can

6

be derived [16, 17].

J.-M. Richard

Many other conﬁgurations have been studied in the literature. In particu-
lar, all those with m3 = m4 have been found to be stable. This property was
checked extensively in Ref. [18]. Thus, for two identical electrons (m3 = m4),
the molecule is always stable, irrespective of whether are the masses of the
nuclei are equal or unequal, heavier or lighter than the electrons, or even one
lighter and one heavier.

The results obtained can be very conveniently described using the tetra-
hedron of Fig. 4, which is also referred to by Armour [19]. The thick lines
correspond to stable conﬁgurations with α1 = α2 = 0 or α3 = α4 = 0. The
middle is just the familiar hydrogen molecule with inﬁnitely heavy protons.
The thin sides are outside the stability domain. The conﬁguration at the
middle of a thin line corresponds to (p, e+, ¯p, e−), studied in detail in [19].
The protonium (p¯p) forms a neutral and compact object with much too small
an internuclear separation to bind the positronium atom (e+e−).

3 Further studies

So far, we have restricted ourselves to the ground state and to unit charge.
Several generalizations can be envisaged.

The case of three particles with arbitrary charges ±(q1, −q2, −q3) is dis-

cussed rather extensively in Refs. [20, 21].

In principle, our study can be repeated for excited states. For the ﬁrst
state with speciﬁc quantum numbers (negative parity, or a given value of the
total angular momentum), the convexity properties remain, as one is dealing
with the ground state in another sector of the Hilbert space. For the second
or third state of given quantum numbers, the situation is more delicate.

For excited states, stability should be addressed with respect to the ap-
propriate threshold. For instance, a three-charge state of unnatural parity
J P = 1+ cannot decay into the ground state of an atom and an isolated
charge, unless a photon is also emitted. If one neglects radiative processes,
then the lowest threshold involves an excited atom and is thus much higher
than the threshold relevant for natural-parity states.

The rigorous results on these systems are rather limited. There are for-
tunately more and more powerful methods which can be used for numeri-
cal investigations, among which are the stochastic variational method [22]
and Monte-Carlo methods [23]. Among the remarkable results obtained by

Stability of three- and four-charge systems

7

sophisticated numerical methods, we already mentioned the evidence that
(m+
2 , 1−, 1−) systems are stable ∀ m1, m2. There is also the discovery of
stable excited states for the Positronium molecule [24].

1 , m+

Coulomb systems with more than four particles have been investigated. In
the case of bosons, say (m+, m−)N , it has been known for long-time that the
system becomes more and more bound when the number 2N of constituent
increases. A kind of precocious approach to the large N limit was found in
Ref. [25]. More precise binding energies are provided in Ref. [22]. In more
recent papers, Varga et al. revealed several new stable conﬁgurations with
an atom or an ion binding two positrons [26, 27].

The methods can also be applied to other potentials. For power-law
potentials, the scaling laws are comparable to those of the Coulomb case, and
the stability region can be drawn in a triangle for three-body systems, and
a tetrahedron for four bodies, with similar convexity properties. Otherwise,
the representation acquires additional dimensions.

The role of the number of space dimensions has also been studied [28].

Abstract. We present ionization probability and line shape calculations for the
two-step 3-photon ionization process, 1S 2~ω
εP , of the ground state
−→
of hydrogenic atoms in a non-monochromatic laser ﬁeld with a time–dependent
amplitude. Within the framework of a three–level model, the AC Stark shifts and
non-zero ionization rates of all states involved were taken into account together with
spatial and temporal inhomogeneities of the laser signal. In contrast with the usual
perturbative technique, the time evolution of the atomic states was simulated by direct
numerically solving the system of coupled time–dependent inhomogeneous diﬀerential
equations, being equivalent to the appropriate non-stationary Schr¨odinger equation.
Particular numerical results were obtained for typical parameters of the pulsed laser

ﬁeld that are employed in a new experiment to measure the 1S
in muonium at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The shifts and asymmetries of
the photoionization line shapes revealed may be of relevance for ultra-high precision
experiments in hydrogen in CW laser ﬁelds.

1. Introduction

The dynamics of relaxing quantum systems in suﬃciently strong laser ﬁelds, which are
neither stationary nor monochromatic, is an important aspect of the theory of interaction
between atoms and photon ﬁelds. This problem is of particular practical signiﬁcance
because of dramatic advances in the precision of measurements presently attainable
in spectroscopic experimental studies of hydrogenic and few–particle atoms. Among
the simple atoms that attracted attention in the last few years one should mention:
hydrogen and its isotopes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], positronium [6, 7], denoted (e+
e−), muonium
−
(see [8, 9, 7, 10, 11] and references therein), denoted (µ+
e−), and helium atom [12]. The
measurements of the ground state HFS and the Lamb shift are of particular interest for
these systems. High precision spectroscopy of low–lying transitions in hydrogenic atoms
oﬀers a unique opportunity to test QED calculations and to reﬁne both the fundamental
constants and various properties of respective nuclei. This urges further theoretical
developments intended to describe the well established photon-induced processes in
simple atoms with much higher precision than techniques used so far are able to provide,
in order to allow a proper interpretation of newly available experimental data. In the
present paper the stepwise 3-photon ionization of muonium in a non–monochromatic
laser ﬁeld with a time–dependent amplitude is studied.

It has been recognized already a long time ago (see [13] for a more detailed

of 1 part in 1018. Experimentally, the 1S
2S transition can be induced Doppler–free by
absorbing two photons from two counter–propagating laser beams. In particular, this
scheme is presently used at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory [8] for determination
2S energy separation in muonium to the 1 MHz accuracy. This study oﬀers
of the 1S
an opportunity to improve the present knowledge of the muon/electron mass ratio and,
thereby, of the muon mass itself.
In the course of this investigation, two counter–
propagating pulsed laser beams with almost identical intensities, I(x, y, t), Imax ≈
106 W/cm2, and the same photon energies, hνL ≈
3/16 a.u. (λL = 244 nm) are used.
Thus, the frequency νL is such that it is tuned into resonance with the 2–photon Doppler–
free 1S
2S transition
in muonium is hard to be observed directly, i.e. by detecting radiation emitted as a
result of the 2S–state deexcitation. This is due to the fact that the appropriate line
intensities in muonium happen to be weaker by several orders of magnitude, owing to
much lower densities at which muonium atoms can be produced. Furthermore, the
latter reason necessitates the use of higher laser intensities (by a factor of 104, at least)
that are required for a reasonable signal strength. This demands a pulsed rather than
a CW laser source (as in the case of hydrogen [5]) to be employed. The 2S–state of
muonium is detected therefore via its photoionization by the third photon absorbed

2S transition. Unlike the hydrogen case however, the 1S

Despite the fact that the laser frequency can be calibrated,

in principle, to a
rather high accuracy, there are a number of systematic error sources each of which
2S energy separation in
proves to be essential for precise determination of the 1S
muonium. In this paper we report the results of the theoretical study intended to allow
for one of the most important among these eﬀects, that is, the time-dependent frequency
variation (chirp) of the laser ﬁeld. This phenomenon arises due to the rapid refraction
index variation of the laser media and is hardly avoidable, especially with powerful
pulsed lasers, unless some technical developments are made in order to compensate the
frequency alteration [8, 12]. As will be demonstrated below, the chirped laser signal
immediately makes its appearance in appreciable spurious shifting and broadening of
spectral/photoionization lines, as well as leads to a noticeable distortion of the line
shapes. To estimate the scale of the eﬀect considered, one should note, for example,
that the chirp–induced shift of the center of the ionization line is roughly equal to a
characteristic magnitude of the chirp itself. For the 1S
2S experiment in muonium, the
latter can typically amount to δ/2π
10 . . . 100 MHz, thus leading to the relative shift
7. The eﬀects of such an order are usually
of the line’s center by δ/ωL ≃
10−
completely neglected in atomic physics. Nonetheless, these happen to be crucial for
studies where an absolute accuracy of 1 MHz is anticipated. It is therefore of primary
practical importance to work out a relatively simple theoretical scheme which could allow
one to describe certain types of multi-photon ionization phenomena in hydrogenic atoms,
where an arbitrary time variation of the frequency of the laser ﬁeld is accompanied by
an arbitrary time modulation of its amplitude.

Although the problem of the hydrogenic systems’ interaction with monochromatic
resonant laser ﬁeld with/without the amplitude modulation is investigated quite fully by
now (see [14, 15, 16, 13, 17, 4] and references therein), there have been much fewer studies
where both the amplitude and the frequency of the laser signal vary with time. Even

though, the authors conﬁne themselves in most cases to either 1–photon (rather than
2–photon) resonant transition [18], or treat only somewhat special forms (“abrupt step”,
“exponential ﬁeld pulses” etc.) of the ﬁeld modulation [19]. Under these circumstances,
it seems very desirable to reconsider the problem as a whole, while adapting it speciﬁcally

As usually happens to be true in most practical situations, both the amplitude

denote the eﬀective matrix elements given by the sums in (10)-(12). It has been taken
into account here that the 3–level system is actually probed by a superposition of
two laser ﬁelds (2), rather than by a single one; this results eventually in doubling
all matrix elements. In addition, we have neglected a contribution due to the 2–photon
absorption from each of two laser beams. This contribution comes from the second–order
interactions of an atom with only one of two light waves and makes its appearance ﬁnally
in two Doppler–broadened terms, i.e. depending on a vz–component of atomic velocity in
the laboratory frame, in the expression to deﬁne ionization probabilities. However, after
averaging over vz, as would be required within the framework of a systematic approach,
these terms turn out to be small compared, at the center of the photoionization line
[27, 28], with the Doppler–free ones which originate from (14)-(15). These arguments
provide the ground for the approximation made, although the eﬀects caused by atomic
movement in the media are beyond the scope of our present consideration.

It is relevant to point out here that the matrix elements, Dj,i, (j, i) = a, b, in (14)-
(15) are ωL–dependent. In particular, Db,b has a non–zero imaginary part. The latter

Equations (16a)-(16c) are well suited for numerical calculations with arbitrary

the given system is rather convenient for analytic treatment, as will be demonstrated
In particular, one can develop further perturbative expansion of

equations (16a)-(16b) in terms of the intensity I(r, t). This yields analytic formulae
which, after setting ˙φ(t) = 0, agree with those formerly derived in [17] within the
framework of a 2–level model, for unchirped laser signals. Despite a relatively simple
form of the appropriate equations, however, a not very straightforward numerical
integration is still required in order to calculate, for example, photoionization line proﬁles
in most practical situations, let alone the fact that the result of the work [17] is valid for
rather weak laser intensities only. Note that equations (16a)-(16c) are free from the latter
restriction. Furthermore, unlike our approach employing the probability amplitudes, the
problems similar to those considered in this paper are usually treated (e.g. see [17, 12])
in the formalism of the density matrix [29]. Under the physical conditions adopted here,
these two approaches are equivalent. To facilitate the adequate comparison however, it
is relevant to present here an alternative form of (16a)-(16c), by rewriting the system

It should be pointed out that only real quantities enter equations (18a)-(18e). This
circumstance may be advantageous, especially for numerical calculations, since most
standard numerical packages are not applicable direct to systems of ODE involving
complex–valued coeﬃcients. Apart from that, (16a)-(16c) and (18a)-(18e) generate
identical results, as has been proved by extensive numerical tests carried out by us for
laser signals with various forms of the chirp, pulse envelope, and spatial distribution.

However, before we demonstrate appropriate results (see section 3), it is instructive to
present here an approximate but reasonably accurate analytic solution for C(x). This
consideration seems to be rather useful for a qualitative description of the process as
a whole, since it reveals some key features which make their appearance due to the
non-stationarity of both the frequency and the amplitude of the laser signal.

2.2. Some analytic consideration: equation (16a)

Let us assume, in agreement with (3), that the intensity of the incident radiation is
Gaussian both in time and space and use the most general form of the chirp, ˙φ(t/τ ) (cf.
equation (4)).

To start with, consider Riccati–type equation (16a) to determine the complex–
ca,a(t)
, deﬁned by (13). On introducing the
t/τ , equation (16a) takes the form

distorted due the presence of the chirp.
It is relevant to note that

C(x) approximates the function C(x) qualitatively
correctly for even those Aω which violate condition (23). An elaborate comparison
with exact numerical solutions of (20) shows that, for most applications, the region of
the validity of equation (25) can be safely extended up to Aω . 20 mJ, depending on the
rest laser parameters. At higher pulse energies, the contribution of non–linear eﬀects

becomes so essential that the neglect of the

As follows from the method of our derivation, equation (25) can be readily
generalized on a wide class of similar multi-photon ionization processes that are induced
by not very intense laser ﬁelds and which involve the chirps and laser amplitudes, such

is almost independent of particular form of the chirp, at least for low pulse energies.
To be more precise, equation (26) deﬁnes in fact a non-linear functional of φ(t) whose
“strength” depends, though, on the rest laser parameters. Within certain range of
these parameters (Aω, in the ﬁrst instance), the functional relation (26) turns out to
be weak, so that ρ(Aω, r; [φ]) plays in this case the role of a sort of adiabatic invariant
for 3–photon resonant ionization processes occurring under the action of the ﬁelds with
slow–varying frequencies. Hence, an “almost–conservation” of ρ(Aω, r; [φ]) provides a
simple and easily veriﬁable approximate criterion which enables the photoionization
line proﬁles corresponding to diﬀerent values/forms of the chirp to be compared and
normalized.

The problem discussed here was ﬁrst addressed, to our knowledge, in [32], within
the framework of the similar 3–level model and for low pulse energies only. In contrast
b
with our present approach, however, the genuine photoionization rate of the level
i
(that is, 2S) was set in [32] equal, respectively, to zero and to some time– and energy–
independent constant, while describing the dynamics of the 1st and the 2nd stages of the
resonant 3–photon ionization. Although this approximation provides acceptable results
for Aω . 6 mJ, say, it is of interest, both experimental and theoretical, to reconsider the
entire problem by releasing the above simplifying assumptions and getting, thereby, a
deeper insight into the physics of the process.

2.3.1. Low Aω Let us consider ﬁrst the simplest case of low Aω, such that condition
(23) is satisﬁed. In addition, we will still assume, without a loss of generality, that the
intensity of the incident radiation is Gaussian both in time and space, without specifying,
though, particular form of the chirp for a moment. By making use of equation (16c),
this allows ρ(Aω, r; [φ]) to be expressed in terms of

Note that in either limiting case, the result is independent, in accord with our initial
statement, of particular form of the chirp φ. To clarify this point, one should emphasize
that the only two simpliﬁcations made in the course of derivation were: (i) the use of
C(x) given by (25) and (ii) the replacement of the appropriate exponent by a unity. Both

Here, according to (5), we have discarded the terms in ρ(1)(Aω, r; [φ]) containing the

entire equation (33) turns out to be completely independent of the chirp.

The right–hand side of equation (5) depends (through

eliminate this dependence and to facilitate, thereby, an adequate comparison with
the results of numerical calculations, the left– and right–hand sides of (5) can be
integrated over the entire XOY –plane perpendicular to the direction of the laser beam’s
propagation (z–axis). A clear physical meaning of such an averaging procedure is
discussed in the comments following equation (36).

W ∞c (∆ν, δ, Aω)

In order to check this equation, the numerical calculation of ρ(Aω; [φ]), in a wide
range of Aω and for typical values of the rest physical parameters used in the 1S–2S
experiment in muonium, have been carried out. This was done by an extra numerical
integration of the 3–photon ionization line proﬁles
(see equation (36)
for deﬁnition) over the entire ∆ν–domain. These results are shown in ﬁgure 4, for
three particular pulse energies. At Aω = 4 mJ, being the only value displayed
which satisﬁes condition (23), the plot demonstrates that ρ(Aω; [φ]) is conserved to
the 1% accuracy, within a wide range of the chirp’s magnitude. The mean numerical

Interesting to note that the ﬁrst/second relation in (34) overestimates/underestimate
the true value of ρ(Aω; [φ]). Much better agreement can be anticipated (and actually
takes place) for lower pulse energies and/or bigger spatial dispersions σr. For Aω = 2 mJ
and σr = 1.5 mm (apppropriate line proﬁles are displayed in ﬁgure 5(a)), for example,

2.3.2. High Aω For higher pulse energies and/or smaller spatial dispersions σr, such
1, equation (34) fails to describe adequately the true function
that
ρ(Aω; [φ]). This refers both to the absolute values of ρ(Aω; [φ]) and, particularly, to
its dependence on the magnitude of the chirp, which makes its appearance at high
pulse energies. It has been elucidated above that the main underlying reason for this
failure originates from the fact that “the linear approximation” ceases to be valid any
longer, due to corrections caused by the C 2–term in equation (20). This non–linear
term does not allow any reasonably accurate analytic treatment to be developed, so
that the numerical analysis of the problem must be used instead. To simulate the
high–energy regime, the results of our calculation are presented in ﬁgure 4, for two
pulse energies, Aω = 10, 20 mJ, and for typical values of the rest physical parameters
used in the 1S–2S experiment in muonium. As in the case of low Aω, this was done
W ∞c (∆ν, δ, Aω)
by the numerical integration of the 3–photon ionization line proﬁles
i
over the entire ∆ν–domain. The plots demonstrate in fact a noticeable deviation of
ρ(Aω; [φ]) from a constant value, with an increase of the pulse energy. For example,
at Aω = 20 mJ and for δ in the range δ = 0 . . . 500/(2π) MHz, this deviation (that is,
the dependence on the chirp’s magnitude) amounts already to 30%; in absolute units,
the data read: ρ(Aω = 20 mJ, σr = 0.64 mm; [φ]) = 2.265 MHz for δ = 0 MHz and
ρ(Aω = 20 mJ, σr = 0.64 mm; [φ]) = 2.90 MHz for δ = 500/(2π) MHz. Furthermore, the
gauge of the given deviation may be expected to be even more pronounced at higher pulse
energies, thus preventing us actually from viewing ρ(Aω; [φ]) as a conserving quantity
in this case. Although such Aω are of no practical interest at the moment for the 1S–2S
experimental study with muonium, the entire eﬀect might be of relevance for future
experimental studies where much higher laser intensities are involved.

At the ﬁnal stage of our numerical procedure, a spatial averaging has been

particular choice was adopted according to the so–called “3σ”–rule being inherent to
various problems involving Gaussian law. In the case considered, the “3σ”–rule makes its
appearance through the fact that the values of W ∞c (∆ν, δ, Aω, r) happen to be almost
negligible for r > 3σr, unless the pulse energies higher than Aω = 20 mJ, say, are
considered. For such a high energy regime, the probability W ∞c (∆ν, δ, Aω, r) has a long–

the values of W ∞c (∆ν, δ, Aω, r) may be very close to, yet less than, 1. In this situation
the proper normalization factor diﬀerent from that chosen above must be used so as

point out, however, that such Aω are hardly attainable currently with proper pulsed
lasers sources in the required frequency range. This makes the high energy regime in
the resonant 3–photon ionization with muonium to be mostly of academic rather than
practical interest at the moment, thus justifying the deﬁnition of equation (36). To
avoid any misunderstanding, it must be clearly stated once again that the spurious
eﬀect mentioned here originates solely from the particular choice of the normalization
factor in (36), and has, therefore, nothing to do with either the model developed in
the work or a lack of the numerical accuracy employed by us. The latter was chosen
to be equal to 10−

readily enables one to estimate the

Gaussian laser pulses (3) within the time T and detected eventually in apparatus. Such

where the gas media containing muonium atoms interacts with Nshot = 25 laser pulses

Resonant 3–photon ionization . . .

−

measurements of the 1S
2S energy separation in muonium; particular values employed
are indicated in ﬁgures 5,6. Both these graphs demonstrate appreciable red–shift of the
maxima (i.e. towards lower frequencies, relative to νL = ω2s,1s/4π) of the photoionization
proﬁles with an increase of the chirp.
It must be noted, however, that this shift is
caused by a combination of two competing mechanisms: (i) the shift being due to the
combined AC Stark eﬀect for the 1S- and 2S–levels and (ii) that arising because of the
chirp itself. The curves show that the former mechanism turns out to be small compared
with the latter at relatively small pulse energies, Aω = 2 . . . 4 mJ. At Aω = 4 mJ and
δ = 0, for instance, i.e. in the case of completely unchirped laser signal, the AC Stark
shift amounts approximately to 1 MHz. One can anticipate, however, that the relative
contribution of the AC Stark shift will increase as the laser intensity increases, since
its magnitude is linearly proportional to the laser intensity, whereas the chirp–induced
shift is almost intensity–independent. This behaviour can be seen in ﬁgures 6(a,b) and
is summarized in ﬁgure 7(a) showing, in particular, that the AC Stark shift becomes
equals to 4 MHz at A = 20 mJ, δ = 0. In addition to the shift of the maxima, the
curves in ﬁgures 5,6 exhibit a strong dependence on both the spatial dispersion σr and
the power Aω of the laser signal.
It should be noted that an appreciable distortion
of the photoionization line shapes happens to be particularly enhanced at relatively
large chirp values, where the line proﬁles become asymmetric. Generally speaking, this
asymmetry is an intrinsic feature of the 3–photon resonant photoionization occurring
under the action of the chirped pulsed laser signal. Moreover, an asymmetry of the

or suppressed, depending on whether the time–dependent chirped laser frequency is in

the resonance with the 2–photon
transition or slightly oﬀ it. The process
i
as a whole becomes then somewhat “time–sensitive”, although the form of the laser
pulse envelope used is time–invariant. It should be noted, however, that the gauge of
the above asymmetry depends strongly on the laser power, as well as particular forms
of the laser amplitude and the chirp. This dependence can be seen in ﬁgures 6(a,b)
where higher Aω–values as compared with ﬁgures 5(a,b) are used. The former show
that the asymmetry discussed is less pronounced as long as higher laser intensities are
involved. Two essential characteristics of the line proﬁles’ maximum, that are, the
shift and the magnitude, are plotted in ﬁgure 7(a,b) as functions of the laser power for
various values of the chirp. In particular, the graph 7(b) provides information about
the dependence of the line shapes’ maximum value, W max
(δ, Aω), on the pulse energy
Aω. It is quite natural to parameterize this relation by the following simple power law:
(δ, Aω) = γ(δ)Aµ(Aω ). The exponent here proves to be a slow–varying function of

One should note, for example, an appreciable deviation of the µ(Aω)–values from 3

which must be expected for a 2–step 3–photon ionization of an atom in the state

Finally, it should be mentioned that the above consideration has been developed
mainly in the attempt to simulate those line proﬁles of the two–step 3–photon ionization
2S experimental
probabilities that are supposed to be measured soon in the new 1S
investigation of muonium. Essential physical parameters employed in this study are still
not ﬁxed completely and are subject to further changes. It is therefore rather tempting to
apply our present technique to appropriate data formerly collected within the framework
of the previously employed experimental setup [8]. These are shown in ﬁgures 9(a,b),
along with the photoionization line proﬁle obtained within the framework of the current
theoretical approach, ﬁgure 9(c). The fact that the corresponding experimental line
shape (not shown) is virtually indistinguishable from the theoretical one provides an
additional and independent check of the overall validity of the model developed in this
work.

4. Conclusion

We have developed a simple theoretical scheme intended to describe, to the 1 MHz
accuracy, the stepwise 3–photon resonant photoionization in hydrogenic systems,
induced by the chirped laser ﬁeld with time–dependent amplitude. It has been shown
that such an accuracy can be achieved within the framework of a simple 3-level model,
by taking into account (i) the AC Stark shifts and (ii) non-zero ionization rates of the
levels involved, together with (iii) a spatial inhomogeneity of the laser signal and (iv)
arbitrary t-dependencies of its intensity (pulse envelope), I(r, t), and frequency, ω(t).
The system of equations (16b)-(16c) or, equivalently, equations (18a)-(18e) is a key point

interest for ultra-high precision laser spectroscopy, and it should be expected that an
adequate interpretation of experimental data should require an accurate theoretical
account of a wide spectrum of light–induced eﬀects. Some of these eﬀects are beyond
the scope of our present consideration and, in the ﬁrst instance, comprise appropriate
corrections due to inevitable motion of atoms in the media and associated second order
Doppler shifts, as being of major importance. Indeed, even for CW lasers where the
signals are usually almost unchirped in the laboratory frame, the amplitude and the
frequency of the pulsed laser signals become essentially time–dependent in the atomic
rest frame, thus leading, as was demonstrated above, to the shifts and distortions of
ionization/excitation lines. The relative contribution of the eﬀects discussed is estimated
as α2v2
z with vz being the atomic velocity in the laboratory frame, and these should be
incorporated in the theoretical scheme developed here, along with relativistic/radiative
α2 to the operator of the particle–laser ﬁeld interaction. This work is
corrections
currently in progress, and we consider it as a subject of forthcoming publications.

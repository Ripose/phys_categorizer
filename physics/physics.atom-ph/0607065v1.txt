Abstrat

We propose two experimental shemes to determine and so to realize the Avogadro onstant NA at the
or better with a watt balane experiment and a old atom experiment measuring h/m(X)
(where h is the Plank onstant and m(X) the mass of the atom X ). We give some prospets about

−7

level of 10

ahievable unertainties and we disuss the opportunity to test the existene of possible unknown

orretion fators for the Josephson e(cid:27)et and quantum Hall e(cid:27)et.

1. Introdution

The best estimates of the fundamental onstants are determined by the Codata adjustments [1, 2℄.

A key weakness of this adjustment is the lak of redundany of input data. Espeially, this makes

the determination of the Plank onstant h and the Avogadro onstant NA less on(cid:28)dent [2℄.

In

this paper, we propose to assoiate watt balane and old atoms experiments to de(cid:28)ne new diret

experimental ways to realize the Avogadro onstant with a ompetitive unertainty in omparison

with the best determination obtained from the molar volume of a silion rystal (3.1×10
Moreover, the reent proposal of rede(cid:28)nition of the kilogramme either by (cid:28)xing the value of h or
the value of NA [4, 5, 6℄ will be reinfored by many independent experimental determinations or
omparisons of these onstants. Assoiated with a determination of NA at the level of 10
proposed experiments an be used to hek the validity of the produt K 2

J RK (where KJ and RK ,

−8

) [3℄.

, the

−7

the Josephson and the von Klitzing onstants, are respetively assoiated to the Josephson and the

quantum Hall e(cid:27)ets).

2. Priniple of the NA realization

2.1 Quantities measured by the two experiments

From its de(cid:28)nition, NA an be expressed as the ratio between atomi and marosopi quantities suh

as the atomi mass and the molar mass of any element. As it is already done in the above mentioned

single rystal silion determination, any ouple of experiments giving aess to these quantities may

be onsidered. Another possible ombination onsists in bringing together a watt balane intended

to link the kilogram to an invariant quantity and a h/m(X) experiment. Indeed, integrating these
two experiments leads to the determination of NA using the relation :

1

NA =

Ar(X)Mu

1
h

h
m(X)

where Ar (X) is the relative atomi mass of X and Mu is the molar mass onstant (Mu=10
−1

mol

).

The watt balane experiment onsists in omparing a mehanial power to an eletromagneti

power [7℄. This omparison is performed in two steps.

In a stati phase, the Laplae fore on a

oil driven by a DC urrent and submitted to an indution (cid:28)eld is ompared to the weight of a

standard mass, linked to the kilogram M . In a dynami measurement, the voltage indued at the
terminals of the same oil is measured when it is moved in the same (cid:28)eld at a known veloity V .

The measurement of eletrial quantities by omparison to the Josephson e(cid:27)et and the quantum

Hall e(cid:27)et (QHE) allows then to link the mass of the kilogram to the produt K 2

JRK .

MK 2

J RK =

A
g(w)V

where A = f1f2
p

is proportional to the produt of the two Josephson frequenies involved in the

voltage measurements during the stati and dynami phases [8℄. The dimensionless p is relative to the
alibration of a resistane standard against the quantum Hall e(cid:27)et and g(w)
seen by the marosopi mass M . Writing the quantities to be measured in the experiment between
brakets {}, the watt balane an determine {K 2
absolute gravimeter, as well as {K 2

J RK } if g(w)

The ratio h/m(X) is determined by measuring the reoil veloity (vr = ~k/m(X)) de(cid:28)ned as
the veloity indued by light when an atom at rest absorbs a photon of momentum ~k . The ratio
h/m(133Cs) has been measured for the (cid:28)rst time, at Standford, using an atom interferometer with

J RKg(w)

is measured independently with an

is the loal aeleration

}.

a relative unertainty of 15 ppb [9℄. In another experiment, in Paris, we have measured the ratio

h/m(87Rb) with a relative unertainty of 13 ppb using Bloh osillations in an optial lattie [10℄. A

narrow veloity lass is seleted from old atoms sample with a Raman -pulse. This veloity lass is

aelerated with Bloh osillations. This proess allows us to transfer e(cid:30)iently a high number of

photon momenta [11℄. The (cid:28)nal veloity is measured with another Raman pulse. This experiment

an run in two modes leading to two ways to determine the Avogadro onstant labelled N (1)
N (2)

A hereafter.

A and

In the (cid:28)rst mode, a vertial optial standing wave is used to hold the atoms against gravity [12℄.

The atoms osillate at the same plae at the Bloh frequeny (νBloch ):

νBloch =

m(87Rb)g(a)λopt
2h

where λopt is the wavelength of the optial wave and g(a)

atoms. The quantity {h/m(87Rb)g(a)

If the two experiments are brought lose enough, the two loal aelerations g(w)

and g(a)

an be

} is measured in terms of frequenies.

is the loal aeleration seen by the

ompared aurately with relative gravimeters [13℄. Combining the quantities measured by the two

experiments leads to determine:

(1)

−3

kg

(2)

(3)

(4)

In the seond mode of the h/m(87Rb) experiment, the atoms are aelerated up and down with
Bloh osillations. The resulting di(cid:27)erential measurement of h/m87Rb is independent of the loal

{K 2

J RKg(w)}{

h
m(87Rb)g(a) }{

g(a))
g(w) }

2

aeleration g [10℄. Again the quantity {h/m(87Rb)} is measured in terms of frequenies. The

ombination of the two experiments gives:

2.2 Determination of NA

The values assigned by theory to KJ and RK are :

and

{K 2

JRK}{

h
m(87Rb)

}

KJ =

RK =

2e
h

h
e2

where e is the elementary harge. The theoretial value of K 2
J RK is then 4/h.
If these relations are onsidered to be exat, the realization of NA labelled N (1)

A and N (2)

A an be

written as :

N (1)

A = {

K 2

JRKg(w)
4

}{

h
m(87Rb)g(a) }{

g(a))
g(w) }Ar(87Rb)Mu

N (2)

A = {

K 2
J RK
4

}{

h
m(87Rb)

}Ar(87Rb)Mu

Notie that the realization of N (1)
(w)

(a)

gravity g

and g

A does not need the knowledge of the absolute values of the loal

but only their relative values. In the ase of N (2)

A , the knowledge of requires an

absolute measurement of g

(see eq. 2).

(w)

2.3 Test of K 2

JRK

However, proposing a new de(cid:28)nition of the kilogram in terms of a fundamental onstant requires

to lay on both theoretial and experimental arguments. Even if the reproduibility of the quantum

Hall e(cid:27)et and the Josephson e(cid:27)et has been tested with a relative unertainty better than 1× 10

−10

under various experimental onditions (material, temperature,...), there is no experimental proof

at this level that KJ and RK are equal to their theoretial values [14, 15℄. At present, the only
way to verify that RK is e(cid:27)etively equal to h/e2

onsists in omparing its value obtained from an

experiment involving a QHE setup and the Lampard alulable apaitor [16℄ to those derived from

other experiments, suh as determinations. The situation is similar for KJ (assumed to be equal to
2e/h) whose experimental knowledge is issued, up to now, from the use of eletrometers [17℄, even if a

determination an be dedued from the watt balane experiment, provided resistane measurements

are made in SI values by omparison, for example to a Lampard alulable apaitor.

A test of this exatness has been done in the last Codata adjustment, using the multivariate

analysis. The inonsistenies observed among ertain input data have onduted to relax the strit

ondition of equality between RK and KJ and their theoretial values. Two more adjusted onstants
ǫJ and ǫK desribing unknown orretion fators have been added in the adjustment. The expressions
of KJ and RK then beome:

3

and

rewritten as:

KJ =

(1 + ǫJ )

2e
h

RK =

h
e2 (1 + ǫK)

Therefore the relations issued from the two approahes proposed for the experiment may be

N (1)

A = {

K 2

J RKg(w)
4

}{

h
m(87Rb)g(a) }{

N (2)

A = {

K 2
J RK
4

}{

h
m(87Rb)

}

Ar(87Rb)Mu
(1 + ǫJ )2(1 + ǫK)

g(a))
g(w) }
Ar(87Rb)Mu
(1 + ǫJ )2(1 + ǫK)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

3. Disussion

We introdue in this paragraph the present status of the di(cid:27)erent unertainties of these two possible

realizations.

For the determination of N (1)

A , the overall relative standard unertainty is presently limited by the

unertainty of the quantity {

m(87Rb)g(a) }. This ratio has been measured in a preliminary experiment

h

−6

with a relative unertainty of about 10

[12℄, mainly due to vibrations and ollisions with the

bakground vapor. These two tehnial limitations an be overome by using a more suitable vauum

hamber where the Bloh osillations take plae and by improving the vibration isolation. For

example, 4000 Bloh osillations have been reently observed during 10s in the gravity (cid:28)eld [18℄.

The other omponents of unertainty are smaller : the unertainty of the quantity {K 2
be extrapolated from [19℄ at the level of 4× 10
known with an unertainty better than 2× 10
an unertainty of the order 1×10

−10

−9

, the relative atomi mass of rubidium Ar(87Rb) is

JRKg(w)

if the two experimental setups are lose enough [REFERENCE

The di(cid:27)erent ontributions to the relative standard unertainty (ur ) of N (2)

A extrapolated from

into aount some input data, are given in [2℄. We use here the values ǫJ and ǫK alulated with all

the relative unertainty on N (2)

This values may be ompared to the one issued from the siliium [3℄ and to the one reommended

If we now onsider the possible values of ǫJ and ǫK , and the assoiated unertainties issued from the
Cotata tests (see table 1), a new value of N (2)

A an be determined :

The ovariane fator between ǫJ and ǫK is extremely small as ǫK is determined mainly by the
measurements of and RK , while ǫJ should depend only weakly on these measurements [21℄. Taking
into aount a null value for this ovariane leads to a relative unertainty on N (2)

−7

.

If, as mentioned by the groups in harge of the silion pro jet, an unertainty of 2×10

is expeted

A of 2.8×10
−8

in the future [22℄, the proposed determinations ondut to establish a diret link between RK and
KJ derived from solid state physis and h derived from atomi physis. In that ase, gathering the

two experienes ould improve signi(cid:28)antly our on(cid:28)dene in the oherene of the phenomena on

whih a new de(cid:28)nition of the kilogram ould be established and on the experimental data on whih

its mise en pratique ould be based. Considering the above mentioned unertainties, this ould lead

to know the produt hK 2

J RK/4 with a relative unertainty of 5.3×10

−8

.

4. Conlusion

We propose here new ompetitive shemes to realize the Avogadro onstant based on the onjuntion

of h/m(87Rb) experiment and watt balane experiment where all quantities are measured in terms of

frequeny. This proposal emphasizes the strong interest of having a old atom experiment nearby the

watt balane. The versatility of a old atom experiment whih an be used to measure either g(w)
or h/m(87Rb) enables the realization of h and NA with the same watt balane. Presently, provided
it is onsidered that KJ and RK are equal to their theoretial value without any unertainty, NA
an be realized at a level of 5.3×10

. This unertainty rises to 2.8× 10

−8

−7

if one take into aount

[23℄

possible orretion fators disussed by Codata 2002. This shows that the knowledge on the von

Klitzing and Josephson onstants may have a great in(cid:29)uene on the numerial values of fundamental

onstants and that any experiment to improve this knowledge must be enouraged. The aim of the

new experiment using an enrihed silion sphere is to reah a 2×10
determination of NA . An agreement at this level of unertainty with the values of NA issued from
the sheme proposed in this paper ould then lead to a test of the equality of the produt K 2
J RK
with 4/h with a relative unertainty of 5.7×10

−8

. This strongly emphasizes the interest of suh

relative unertainty for the

−8

determinations before the rede(cid:28)nition of the kilogram and its mise en pratique.

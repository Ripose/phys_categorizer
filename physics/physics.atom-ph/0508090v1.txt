(Dated: January 9, 2014)

This theoretical paper investigates the formation of ground state molecules from ultracold cesium
atoms in a two-color scheme. Following previous work on photoassociation with chirped picosecond
pulses [Luc-Koenig et al., Phys. Rev. A 70, 033414 (2004)], we investigate stabilization by a second
(dump) pulse. By appropriately choosing the dump pulse parameters and time delay with respect to
the photoassociation pulse, we show that a large number of deeply bound molecules are created in the
ground triplet state. We discuss (i) broad-bandwidth dump pulses which maximize the probability
to form molecules while creating a broad vibrational distribution as well as (ii) narrow-bandwidth
pulses populating a single vibrational ground state level, bound by 113 cm−1. The use of chirped
pulses makes the two-color scheme robust, simple and eﬃcient.

INTRODUCTION

≤

1 K) or ultracold (T

The ﬁeld of cold molecules is rapidly developing, since
many research groups are working at the production of
100
dense samples of cold (T
≤
µK) molecules [1]. Moreover, the ﬁeld of molecular con-
densates has opened recently, with experimental evidence
for molecules formed in a degenerate gas, starting either
from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
or from an atomic Fermi gas [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
This intense activity is motivated by possible applica-
tions to very precise measurements (lifetimes, checks on
parity violation, determination of a possible dipole mo-
ment of the electron as a check for the standard model
in elementary particles), Bose-Einstein condensation of
complex systems (molecule laser), or the emergence of a
new ultracold chemistry.

Among the various

to produce ultracold
routes
molecules, photoassociation has emerged as a purely op-
tical technique starting from an assembly of laser-cooled
atoms in a trap. The reaction takes place when a pair of
ground state atoms interacting via the potential Vground
absorbs a photon red-detuned compared to the atomic
line. At resonance, one vibrational level in an excited
electronic potential Vexc of the molecule is populated.
The reaction can be interpreted as a vertical transition at
large distances, forming a long range molecule. We shall
consider the example of two cold cesium atoms colliding
in the lower triplet a3Σ+
u (6s + 6s) potential and forming
a molecule in a vibrational level v′ of the 0−
g (6s + 6p3/2)
potential. The ﬁrst experimental observation of ultracold
Cs2 molecules has made use of this reaction [14].

In order to make molecules in the ground or lower
triplet state, the photoassociation step must be followed

∗Electronic address: ckoch@fh.huji.ac.il

by a stabilization step. The photoassociated molecules
are short-lived and decay via spontaneous emission, most
often through a vertical transition at large interatomic
distances R giving back a pair of atoms. However, spe-
ciﬁc mechanisms which favor radiative decay at shorter
distances exist and allow for populating bound vibra-
tional levels in the potential Vground(R) (or possibly, for
instance in case of heteronuclear dimers, to another po-
tential correlated to the same asymptote [15]).
In the
special case of the double well 0−
g (6s + 6p3/2) excited po-
tential of Cs2, the smooth barrier between the two wells
acts as a “speed bump” and slows down the vibrational
motion in the external well such that vertical transitions
can take place at intermediate distances Rint. Stable
molecules formed by spontaneous emission through this
mechanism have been detected in a MOT [14]. Other eﬃ-
cient stabilization mechanisms such as resonant coupling
[16, 17, 18] exist.

In a condensate, in order to retain coherence, sponta-
neous emission should be avoided and a stabilization step
involving stimulated emission should be implemented
within a two-color experiment. However, with continu-
ous wave (cw) lasers such experiments are hardly feasible
since the scheme is fully reversible: Population is pumped
back from bound levels of the ground state to the excited
state, and then to continuum levels of the ground state,
i.e. the molecule is dissociated. The use of laser pulses
becomes thus unavoidable.

In previous work [19, 20, 21], the possibility to in-
crease the eﬃciency of the photoassociation reaction by
use of chirped laser pulses was considered. The frequency
of such pulses has a linear time-dependence. The pa-
rameters of the pulse were optimized to achieve a total
transfer of population under adiabatic following condi-
tions [22, 23, 24]. It was shown [20, 21] that a signiﬁcant
improvement of the photoassociation rate compared to
cw excitation can be obtained, since during the pulse the
resonance condition is fulﬁlled for several vibrational lev-
els v′. However, the quantity which must be improved is

the formation rate of ground state molecules rather than
the photoassociation rate. One advantage of excitation
with chirped pulses is that the chirp parameter can be
chosen to modify the shape of the vibrational wave packet
formed in the potential Vexc. This may improve the ef-
ﬁciency of the stabilization step, and thus the formation
rate of ground state molecules.

The aim of the present work is therefore to suggest a
two-color experiment using short laser pulses and to in-
vestigate how eﬃciently a second pulse can transfer the
population to the bound vibrational levels of the ground
state. Starting from the vibrational wave packet formed
in the excited state by photoassociation, we introduce a
second pulse which is delayed in time from the ﬁrst pulse.
The time delay is chosen such that the wave packet has
reached the vicinity of the inner turning point, where a
vertical radiative transition to the ground state is ex-
pected to be eﬃcient. The parameters of the second
pulse, as well as the time delay between the two pulses are
varied to improve the eﬃciency of the transfer, with two
diﬀerent goals: to either maximize the total population
transfer, or to selectively populate one vibrational level.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we recall
the main results of previous work on photoassociation
with chirped laser pulses. The two-color scheme is intro-
duced in Sec. III, and the best choice for the dump pulse
discussed by considering the Franck-Condon overlap be-
tween the vibrational wave packet in the excited state
and wave functions of the bound levels in the ground
state. The results for maximum population transfer are
presented in Sec. IV while Sec. V reports on the selective
population of a single level. Finally Sec. VI concludes.

II. CHIRPED PULSE PHOTOASSOCIATION IN
CS2 AND CREATION OF A FOCUSSED
VIBRATIONAL WAVE PACKET

We brieﬂy summarize the main results of Refs. [20, 21]
for the photoassociation of cold cesium atoms by chirped
laser pulses. The main diﬀerence to cw excitation lies
in two facts: Several levels can be populated in the
photoassociation step, and the vibrational wave packet
can be shaped in order to allow for spatial ”focussing”,
as described below. We start from a transform-limited
pulse with Gaussian envelope, hereafter referred to as
pump pulse, with maximum at t = tP , and with full
width at half maximum of the temporal intensity proﬁle
(FWHMI) τL=15 ps. Chirping the pulse stretches the
FWHMI to τC =34.8 ps and decreases the maximum in-
τC (IL =120 kW cm−2), conserving the
tensity IL →
energy carried by the ﬁeld. Moreover, 98% of this energy

where the carrier frequency ωL is chosen red-detuned

by 2.65 cm−1. χP is the linear chirp rate in time domain,
chosen negative and equal to -0.025 cm−1 ps−1. The pa-
rameters of the pump pulse, labelled

Table I. We will also consider other possibilities for the
pump pulse, with positive or zero chirp, or with a smaller
detuning: such pulses are respectively labelled

nant with the excited level v′=122. The parameters for

transform-limited pulse, while in Refs. [20, 21] τL was
deﬁned with respect to intensity (FWHMI). fP is the
stretching factor due to chirping. During the time win-
dow, the central frequency is swept from ωL −
χτC to
ωL+χτC such that the resonance condition is satisﬁed for
15 vibrational levels around v′
L=98 in the energy range
0.87 cm−1. Depending upon the sign
2~
of the chirp, the frequency is increasing (χP > 0) or de-
creasing (χP < 0) with time.

The dynamics of the photoassociation process was
studied by numerical solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation describing the motion of wave pack-
ets in the ground state potential a3Σ+
u (6s + 6s) (Vground)
and in the 0−
g (6s 2S1/2 + 6p 2P3/2) excited potential
(Vexc) coupled by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The ini-
tial state is represented by a stationary continuum wave
function describing the relative motion (s-wave) of two
colliding Cs (6s, F=4) atoms, with an initial kinetic en-
ergy of 54 µK. The wave packet in the excited potential
Vexc is analyzed by projection onto the vibrational wave
functions of the v′ levels in the external well. The main
results of the calculations are:

During the pulse, many vibrational levels are pop-
ulated. However, after the pulse, the population
remains only in the 15 vibrational levels resonantly
excited around v′
L=98. This deﬁnes a photoassoci-
ation window in the energy domain, for the levels
located between v′
1=106 and v′
2 = 92, bound by
1.74 cm−1 and 3.57 cm−1, respectively.

In the impulsive approximation [25], assuming that
the relative motion of the two atoms is frozen dur-
ing the pulse, it is possible to analyze the numer-
ical results by a two-state model at each internu-
clear distance R. While the frequency of the laser

the resonance condition corresponds to a vertical
transition at R = Rc(t), this deﬁnes a photoasso-
in the example
ciation window in the R domain:
chosen, Rmin = 85 and Rmax =107 a0. Within this
range of distances, all the population of the initial
continuum level can be adiabatically transferred to
the excited state.

′

In the excited state, the levels v′ which are popu-
lated have a classical outer turning point Rv
out in
the [Rmin, Rmax] range, and the two-state model
predicts that the population transfer occurs around
the time tv′ when Rv
out= Rc(tv′ ). For a negative
chirp, the position of the crossing point varies from
Rmax to Rmin, so that the upper levels are popu-
lated ﬁrst (see Fig. 1). For the pump pulse consid-
ered, the level v′
1= 106 is populated at the begin-
τC ), the level
ning of the time window (t1 ∼
(tP −
v′
tP + τC ), i.e.
2 = 92 is populated at the end (t2 ∼
70 ps later. It is the opposite for a positive chirp,
choosing the

P+ pulse for photoassociation.

The total probability of population transfer to
the excited state is reported in the last column
of Table I. The absolute value is discussed in
Refs. [20, 21], the important result for the present
paper being that the population obtained with
P0
is increased by a factor 8 when a chirped pulse
−
P
is considered, and by a factor of 6 when the pulse

122
− , with a smaller detuning, is used.

After the end of the pulse, the vibrational wave
packet Ψexc(R, t) in the excited state is mov-
ing from the outer classical turning point toward
shorter distances (see Fig.1). We analyze it through
partial wave packets, with main components cor-
responding to the various levels v′. Each one is
reaching the inner turning point at a time which

Focussing of the wave packet is then obtained at
time t3, after half a vibrational period. In contrast,
for a positive chirp the lower levels are populated
ﬁrst, t2 < t1, and a spreading of the vibrational
wave packet is expected.

Several authors in the past have suggested ways of
designing laser ﬁelds for the generation of spatially
squeezed molecular wave packets [27, 28]. Since
they considered low vibrational levels, a numerical
optimization procedure appeared to be necessary.
Here, we are dealing with long range molecules,
where the motion is controlled by the asymptotic
potential, and the availability of scaling laws makes
the optimization easier, as for atomic Rydberg wave
packets [29].

We should note that in the chosen example, the
vibrational progression and the scaling law of the
vibrational period are slightly perturbed due to
a tunneling eﬀect for the levels in the vicinity of
v′=96 [20, 30]. This leads to a focussing time
2 Tvib(v′ =
t3=tP +135 ps, slightly diﬀerent from 1
98) =125 ps. Moreover, the early population of lev-
els which are perturbed by tunneling leads to popu-
lation transfer to the inner well of the 0−
g (6s+6p3/2)
excited potential. This tunneling eﬀect is not a
general phenomenon, but very speciﬁc to the ce-
sium 0−
g molecular curve, and to the value chosen
for the detuning. A detailed investigation would re-
quire consideration of two coupled channels in the
region of the inner potential [30], beyond the scope
of this work.

In the present calculations, we start from the wave
packet in the excited state and investigate how the pop-
ulation can eﬃciently be transferred to vibrational levels
of the ground state by the second pulse. As in our pre-
vious work, this is achieved by studying the wave packet
dynamics by numerical solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (cf. Ref. [20, 21] for an overview
over numerical methods and Appendix A for a discus-
sion of the representation of continuum states).

III. THE TWO-COLOR SCHEME

The scheme we suggest is illustrated in Fig. 2 (left),
where we have represented, at diﬀerent times, the wave
packet created by the negatively chirped picosecond pulse
−. We consider a vibrational wave packet Ψexc(R, t =
P
tP + tdyn), which has evolved on the excited state poten-
tial for time tdyn after the maximum of the pump pulse

We ﬁrst compute the Franck-Condon overlap matrix
2 of the excited state wave
elements
packet with the bound ground state eigenfunctions (cf.
Fig. 2, right). The results markedly depend upon tdyn,
and so does the probability to form stable molecules. For
instance, just after the photoassociation pulse, at time
tP + 40 ps
tP + τC (circles in Fig. 2, right), the Franck-
Condon overlap factors are negligible for most bound lev-
els of the ground state, except for the last level v′′ = 53
10−6 cm−1 [20]). In con-
which is very loosely bound (5
trast, half a vibrational period later, at time tP +135 ps
when the wave packet has moved to the inner turning
point (diamonds in Fig. 2, right), a signiﬁcant overlap is
obtained with various deeply bound levels of the ground
state, in particular with v′′ = 6, 14, 20. The large overlap
with ϕg
v′′=14(R) can be explained by the coincidence of
the inner classical turning point of the level v′=92 and
the outer turning point of v′′=14, such that v′=92
→
v′′=14 is a Franck-Condon transition. This large value
is restricted to a short (
2 ps) time window around
∼ ±
tP + 135 ps as illustrated in Fig. 3, where the time-
dependence of the Franck-Condon overlap is shown. Note
that the overlap with v′′ = 6 is due to population in the
inner well of Vexc due to tunneling [30]. From Fig. 3, we
can indeed see that this population remains trapped at
the considered timescale.

tP ≤

The above mentioned large overlap with the last vibra-
tional level of the ground state just after the photoasso-
ciation pulse (t
τC ) is seen to reappear after one
vibrational period, when the wave packet reaches again
the outer turning point. However, we will not choose
one of the last bound levels of the ground state as our
target vibrational level v′′, since a signiﬁcant population
is already achieved in a one-color experiment [20, 21],
making the implementation of a two-color scheme super-
ﬂuous. In fact, the speciﬁc advantage of a pump-dump
experiment is the possibility of stabilization into deeply
bound levels in the ground state. We will therefore fo-
cus on populating the level v′′ = 14 with binding energy
Eb = 113 cm−1, and we will consider a second (or dump)
pulse
with parameters adapted to eﬃcient population
transfer toward v′′ = 14, in particular with a time delay
close to 135 ps.

photoassociation pulse is maximum. When the wave packet is focussed at the inner turning point, there is a maximum overlap
with the level v′′ = 14 of the ground state.

B. Choice of parameters for the second pulse

For the dump pulse
, we deﬁne a central frequency
ωD
L , a maximum intensity IL, a duration (FWHME) of
the transform-limited pulse τD, the time of maximum
amplitude tD, and a stretching factor fD characterizing
the strength of the chirp. The choice of the second color
is dictated by the choice of the target levels. For v′′ = 14
(cf. Fig. 2, right), we have chosen a central frequency
L = 11843.5 cm−1, which is resonant with v′′ = 14
ωD
for a binding energy of the excited state wave packet
equal to 2.1 cm−1. This binding energy, computed as
, where ˆT is the kinetic

energy operator, stays time-independent once the pho-
toassociation pulse is over. It is found 0.5 cm−1 smaller
than the binding energy of the level v′ = v′
L = 98 which
is resonant with the central frequency of the pump pulse.
This diﬀerence reﬂects the non-symmetric population of
the v′ levels relative to v′
L, the photoassociation process
being much more eﬃcient for the upper levels.

D

The spectral width of the second pulse

is limited by
the requirement that mostly bound levels should be pop-
ulated in the ground state. Since v′′=14 is bound by 113
cm−1, the energy spread of the vibrational wave packet
in the excited state can be neglected and the maximum
113 cm−1. Therefore,
spectral width is estimated as 2
×
(FWHME τ D

93 fs), population
transfer to the continuum is to be expected leading to
the formation of pairs of “hot” atoms. This conclusion

≤

D

relies on overlap integrals and needs to be corrected by
the possible energy dependence of the transition dipole
moment µ(R). Finally, if we wish to selectively excite
the level v′′ = 14, the spectral width is limited by the vi-
brational energy splitting around v′′ = 14 which is about
7 cm−1. The typical pulse temporal width τ D of the
dump pulse should therefore be larger than 2 ps. In the
following, we will discuss two schemes to form ground
state molecules:

1. For short pulses in the 10-300 fs range,

impor-
tant population transfer to several bound levels of
the ground electronic state can be obtained (cf.
Sec.IV). The goal is then to maximize the total
population transfer. The intensity, duration and
possibly stretching factor, i.e. chirp, of the
pulses
will be systematically varied.

D

2. For longer pulses in the picosecond domain, transfer
of population to a single vibrational level, namely
v′′=14, is possible (see Sec.V). The goal is then to
optimize selective population transfer to a chosen
level.

The third parameter is the time-delay between the two
tP . The discussion can be guided

pulses, deﬁned as tD −
by the following arguments, illustrated in Fig. 4:

•

First, we can use a simple model for the choice
tP . Considering the wave
of the time delay tD −

state.
It is clear that the over-
lap with deeply bound ground state levels (around v′′=14)
is maximum when focussing of the excited state wave packet
occurs, 135 ps or half a vibrational period after tP . In con-
trast, when the wave packet is at its outer turning point just
after the PA pulse and again at about tP +250 ps (one vi-
brational period Tvib), the overlap with only the last bound
levels is signiﬁcant. Moreover, tunneling to and trapping of
population in the inner potential well lead to overlap with
ground state levels around v′′ = 6: this is speciﬁc to the ce-
sium 0−
g (P3/2) state and to the value chosen for the detuning.

Next, we report time-dependent calculations for
various dump pulses where the ﬁeld is treated non-
perturbatively and we start from a focussed wave
packet. Intensity and spectral width are varied (see
below Sec. IV B) in order to check the validity limits
of the above mentioned simple model which relies
on the impulsive approximation and weak ﬁelds.
Then a chirp of the dump pulse is introduced to ob-
tain a robust scheme for population inversion (cf.
Sec. IV C). The dependence on the time delay is
studied in Sec. IV D. We furthermore present calcu-
lations starting from vibrational wave packets cre-
ated with other photoassociation pump pulses such
as

IV. STABILIZATION WITH A BROADBAND
PULSE POPULATING MANY VIBRATIONAL
LEVELS OF THE GROUND STATE

A. Concept of a molecular π pulse

When the aim is to transfer as much population to
the ground state as possible, the discussion of the pulse
parameters is inspired by the arguments on population
inversion in molecular electronic states developed in Refs.
[22, 31]. The basic idea is that for pulses which are short
on the timescale of the vibrational dynamics, the wave
packet does not move during the pulse (impulsive approx-
imation). The molecular system can then be reduced to
an eﬀective two-level system, and it is possible to ﬁnd
a π-pulse which leads to total population transfer. A π-
pulse is deﬁned as a pulse (assumed here to be transform-
limited and with Gaussian envelope) whose Rabi angle,

is equal to an odd multiple of π. A pulse with Rabi
angle equal to an even multiple of π induces zero pop-
ulation transfer. Introducing a chirp enforces adiabatic
following conditions for all Rabi angles > π and there-
fore suppresses the oscillations in population transfer as
a function of the Rabi angle [22, 24, 31].

B.

Inducing maximum population inversion

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation describing
the evolution of the wave packets Ψexc(R, t) and Ψg(R, t)
in the excited and in the ground state, coupled by the
radiative ﬁeld of the dump pulse is solved numerically.
Our treatment of the ﬁeld is non-perturbative (cf. Refs.
[20, 21]) and for intensities corresponding to Rabi an-
gles ϑ > π deviations from the estimate of Eq. (4) are
expected. Deviations will also occur if the impulsive ap-
proximation ceases to be valid, i.e. for longer pulses. In
this case, nuclear motion during the pulse cannot be ne-
glected and the wave packet is not simply projected to
the electronic ground state.

For all calculations presented in this section, the pa-
rameters of the short dump pulses are recalled in Ta-
ble II. The initial condition is given by the focussed ex-
cited state wave packet at t = tP + 135 ps, normalized to
one such that population corresponds directly to proba-
bility. The propagation is carried out in the time interval

FIG. 5: (Color online) The ﬁnal ground state population (top)
and the ﬁnal population of bound levels in the ground state
(bottom) after a transform-limited dump pulse (see Table II)
as a function of the Rabi angle, i.e. intensity. For all pulse du-
rations shown, we ﬁnd pronounced Rabi oscillations, i.e. the
approximation of an eﬀective two-level systems holds. Very
short pulses (10 fs) are able to induce complete population
inversion, but the population which ends up in bound levels
is limited to about 20%; the dump pulse is then dissociating
80% of the photoassociated molecules. Longer pulses (300 fs)
populate only bound levels and no continuum states, since,
within their bandwidth, only bound levels are on resonance.

In Fig. 5, we analyze the eﬃciency of the population
transfer by varying the intensity of a transform-limited
dump pulse for several durations τ D, in the range of 10-
300 fs. The approximation of an eﬀective two-level sys-
tem is shown to hold for all pulse durations, since oscil-
lations as a function of the Rabi angle are clearly man-
ifested in the ﬁnal state population Pg(tﬁnal) and in the
population of bound levels P bound
(tﬁnal). The contrast of
g
these oscillations is maximum for τ D=10 fs, where total
population inversion is obtained with Pg(tﬁnal) oscillat-
ing between 0 and 1. For longer pulses (τ D= 300 fs),
only 10% of the population is transferred to the ground
state. However, an analysis of the wave packet in the
ground state shows that for the shorter pulses, the pop-
ulation is spread between continuum and bound levels.
The probability to form bound molecules is at most 20%
(τ D=10 fs), so that 80% of the photoassociated molecules
are dissociated by the dump pulse, giving pairs of hot
atoms which usually leave the trap. With longer pulses,
due to their narrower frequency bandwith, the transfer
for τ D=300
to continuum levels is no longer possible:
fs the 11% population transferred to the ground state
is totally stabilized into bound levels. The maximum
population transfer and its eﬃciency are reported in Ta-
ble III, demonstrating that in the intermediate range of
pulse widths, up to 100 fs, a stabilization of
20% of
∼
the photoassociated molecules is to be expected.

The possibility of stabilizing 20% of the photoasso-
ciated molecules is very appealing. However, the vi-
brational distribution of the population transferred to

of course be reduced by considering Rabi angles diﬀer-
ent from π. Therefore, for a given pulse duration, the
scheme is very sensitive to the intensity of the dump
pulse. This can be avoided by introducing chirped dump
pulses [22, 24, 31].

FIG. 6: (Color online) The vibrational distribution of ground
state wave packets after π-pulses (cf. Fig. 5): The distribu-
tions after a 10 fs and 100 fs pulse are almost identical to
the Franck-Condon overlap of the focussed excited state wave
packet with ground state bound levels. The narrower band-
width of a 300 fs pulse allows for less levels to be populated
(cut-oﬀ around v′′ = 10 and v′′=25); furthermore, no contin-
uum states are excited (cf. Table III).

the ground state should also be discussed, since stable
molecules should be formed in low vibrational levels. The
wave packet created in the ground state after a π pulse
is analyzed through projection on the various ϕg
v′′ (R) vi-
brational wave functions, cf. Fig. 6. For short enough
pulses (τ D =10 fs, 100 fs) the distribution follows the
variation of the Franck-Condon overlap discussed above
(cf. Fig. 2, right). The diﬀerence between the 10 fs and
100 fs pulses aﬀects mostly the population of continuum
states (not shown in the ﬁgure). Due to the narrower
bandwith, the longer pulse with τ D =300 fs is only pop-
ulating levels up to v′′=25, and no continuum levels. In
all cases the levels around v′′=14 are preferentially pop-
ulated. The eﬃciency of the stabilization process would

C. Chirping the dump pulse to suppress
oscillations as a function of the Rabi angle

In Fig. 7, we report numerical results obtained after
chirping the dump pulse, starting from transform-limited
pulses of 100 fs and 300 fs, respectively. The streching
factor fD is varied from 1 to 10, and the linear chirp pa-
rameter χD is chosen to be negative. Note that the Rabi
angles in Fig. 7 only characterize the pulse intensities,
they are those of the corresponding unchirped pulses (the
Rabi angle becomes complex for chirped pulses). Fig. 7
clearly shows that chirping suppresses the variation of
the ﬁnal population as a function of the Rabi angle. For
τ D = 100 fs and fD ≥
5 complete population inversion
is reached at high intensities due to non-perturbative ef-
fects such as power broadening (top left). However, as for
the unchirped pulses, the population of bound levels of
the ground state remains limited to about 20% (bottom
left). The advantage of chirping consists in this value of
20% being obtained for a wide range of Rabi angles (π
to 4 π in our calculations). For τ D= 300 fs, nearly com-
plete population inversion is achieved for stretching fac-
tors fD = 2, 5, and the probability of populating bound
levels becomes close to 20%, as for the shorter pulses.
The chirp parameter should, however, not be too large:
for a strongly chirped pulse (fD = 10) with correspond-
ing transform-limited FWHM τ D= 300 fs, the popula-
tion transfer decreases, and oscillations reappear. This
is due to the breakdown of the eﬀective two-level sys-
tem approximation: With a pulse stretched to 3 ps, it is
no longer justiﬁed to neglect the relative motion of the
nuclei during the pulse.

In Fig. 8, we compare the ﬁnal ground state pop-
ulation after chirped dump pulses with τ D = 300 for
positive and negative chirp. The stretching factor is
again varied from 1 to 10. For pulses with correspond-

ing transform-limited FWHM τ D= 100 fs, no diﬀerence

perform slightly better than those with positive chirp. At
high intensities (ϑ > 4π), diﬀerences between open and

circles) for both pulse durations. For higher intensities
(ϑ = 3π, blue triangles), non-perturbative eﬀects start to
play a role, and the vibrational distribution is changed:
For example, the maximum is not anymore observed for
the level with the largest Franck-Condon factor (v′′ =
14). Furthermore for τ D = 300 fs, the approximation of
an eﬀective two-level system starts to break down due
to the long pulse duration. While at higher intensity
the dynamics becomes harder to interpret, the overall
probability to form bound molecules is increased from
18% (ϑ = π) to 21% (ϑ = 3π) for τ D = 100 fs and from
11% to 16% for τ D = 300 fs.

D. Dependence on the time spent on the excited
state

After excitation by the photoassociation pulse at long
range, the wave packet is accelerated toward shorter dis-
tances until it reaches the inner barrier of the exter-
nal potential well (solid blue line in Fig. 10, top panel).
While a small part of the wave packet tunnels into the
inner potential well, most of it is reﬂected at the bar-
rier and moves back toward larger distances (dashed
red line). The Franck-Condon factors reﬂect this time-
dependence of the excited state wave packet (Fig. 10, bot-
tom panel, see also Fig. 3). Short and suﬃciently intense
pulses (τ D = 100 fs, ϑ = π) allow for inducing maxi-
mum population inversion in both cases, and the ﬁnal
ground state vibrational distributions completely mimic
the Franck-Condon factors (data not shown). How-
ever, only the wave packet at shorter distances has good
Franck-Condon overlap with bound ground state levels,
and ground state molecules are formed by the stabiliza-
tion pulse. For the excited state wave packet at later

times, only the last two bound levels of the ground state
are populated (except for tunneling), and a considerable
amount of population is transferred to the continuum, i.e.
two free atoms are created. Fig. 10 conﬁrms our initial
assumption that stabilization to ground state molecules
is optimal when the excited state wave packet is close to
the inner turning point of the outer potential well.

E. Dependence on the sign of the chirp of the
photoassociation pulse

Excited state wave packets after pump pulses with pos-
−, blue
P+, red dashed lines) and negative chirp (
itive (
P
solid lines) are compared in Fig. 11 at the time of maxi-
mum focussing at the inner barrier. The sign of the chirp
determines how well the excited state wave packet can be
focussed (cf. top panel of Fig. 11). For positive chirp, the
wave packet is less focussed, and the maximum probabil-
ity to form bound molecules is 6% compared to 21% for
negative chirp. Furthermore, almost half of these 6% are
due to the speciﬁc topology of the 0−
g -potential of Cs2,
i.e. tunneling to the inner well. Focussing as obtained
with
− on the other hand represents a general scheme.
As in the previous sections the vibrational distributions
after the dump pulse (data not shown) completely mimic
the Franck-Condon overlap factors for pulses which in-
duce maximum population transfer (e.g. τ D = 100 fs,
ϑ = π). The population of bound levels is then 4.9% for

state occurs for smaller detuning. Hence, the peak in the
Franck-Condon overlap factors around v′′ = 6 is missing.

ϑ = π). However, the probability of populating bound
ground state levels is at 3.4% considerably smaller. The
eﬃciency of the complete two-color scheme is of course
given by the eﬃciencies of pump and dump steps. One
has to keep in mind that since the probability of the pho-

V. HOW TO CREATE GROUND STATE
MOLECULES IN A SINGLE LEVEL

In order to achieve selective population of the level
v′′ = 14, we consider longer pulses, with parameters re-
ported in Table IV. As explained in Sec. III B, pulses
with corresponding transform-limited FWHM τ D > 2
ps are expected to populate a single vibrational level.
Fig. 13 reports the ﬁnal ground state population af-
ter dump pulses with τ D = 1 ps (black circles), 2 ps
(blue diamonds) and 3 ps (red triangles) as a function
of the Rabi angle, i.e. pulse intensity on the left, and
corresponding vibrational distributions on the right. A
pulse with τ D = 3 ps and moderate intensity indeed ex-
cites exclusively a single vibrational level (ﬁlled red tri-
angles in Fig. 13, right). The population of this level
is Pv′′=14 = 0.12 compared to the total population of
P bound
= 0.13. A broadening of the vibrational distri-
bution is only observed at fairly high intensity (ϑ
6π,
empty red triangles). For τ D = 1 ps, broadening of the
vibrational distribution sets in already at lower inten-
3π, empty black circles). For τ D = 1 ps,
sities (ϑ
oscillations of the ﬁnal population with the Rabi angle
still persist, albeit with much lower contrast than for the
broad-bandwidth pulses of Sec. IV. For longer pulses, the
impulsive approximation completely ceases to be valid,
and the behavior cannot anymore be understood (and
employed for control) in terms of an eﬀective two-level

system. Chirping prolongs the pulses even further, and
its eﬀect on the ﬁnal populations and vibrational distri-
butions is investigated in Fig. 14 which compares mod-
erately chirped pulses (stretching factors fD = 1.5, red
diamonds and fD = 2, blue triangles) to the unchirped
case (black circles) for τ D = 3 ps. The ﬁnal ground
state population (blue triangles, fD = 2) is decreased af-
ter a chirped pulse as compared to the unchirped case.
However, a slight negative chirp (ﬁlled red diamdonds,
fD = 1.5) does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the population
transfer. In general, a range of intensities corresponding
to Rabi angles 2π
3π exists where 10% or more
of the excited state wave packet are transferred to the
ground state, almost exclusively to the vibrational level
v′′ = 14 (cf. Fig. 14, right). This result implies that some
chirping (which might always occur in an experimental
setup) does not perturb stabilization into a single level,
i.e. the scheme is expected to be fairly robust.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The formation of ultracold molecules is presently a
very active ﬁeld. Previous work has demonstrated the
advantage of using chirped laser pulses to create ul-
tracold molecules by photoassociation in an assembly
of cold atoms [20, 21]. The molecules are created in
an electronically excited state and are short-lived. A
stabilization step must therefore be implemented. The
present theoretical work has discussed a two-color pump-
dump experiment where a second pulse, delayed from the
photoassociation (pump) pulse, transfers population to
deeply bound levels of the ground state, creating stable
molecules.

Following Ref. [20], the pump pulse (with picosecond
duration and maximum at time tP ) photoassociates Cs

atoms populating, via an adiabatic transfer mechanism,
about 15 vibrational levels in the external well of the
0−
g (6s 2S1/2 + 6p 2P3/2) potential curve. A vibrational
wave packet is created which is bound by 2.1 cm−1 and
localized in the region of the outer turning point. After
the pulse, the wave packet moves toward the inner bar-
rier of the potential curve (located at Rin). The chirp pa-
rameter of the pump pulse can be chosen such that after
half a vibrational period, at time tP + Tvib/2, this wave
packet is focussed at the barrier [20]. Our analysis of
the Franck-Condon overlap integrals has shown that the
overlap with deeply bound levels v′′ of the ground triplet
state is then maximum. A vertical transition toward the
level v′′=14, bound by 113 cm−1, is even possible, since
the outer turning point of the corresponding wave func-
tion coincides with Rin. We therefore have discussed how
population can eﬃciently be transferred to the ground
triplet state by a short dump pulse which should be in
the femto- or picosecond domain and optimally delayed
from the pump pulse by Tvib/2.

The validity of this intuitive model has been checked
with numerical calculations. We have considered two
kinds of pulses: broadband pulses populating many vi-
brational levels of the ground state, with the aim of max-
imizing the population transfer, and longer pulses for se-
lective population of a single level, v′′=14.

The ﬁrst set of calculations has been performed for a
time delay of Tvib/2. We have shown that for short pulses
and a Rabi angle equal to π, total population inver-
sion can be obtained, i.e. the vibrational wave packet in
the excited state is completely transferred to the ground
state. Analysis of the wave packet shows that a max-
imum of 20% of this population goes to bound levels.
The remaining 80% correspond to continuum states, i.e.
the dump pulse also creates pairs of hot atoms. The vi-
brational distribution reﬂects the variation of the Franck
Condon overlap. Oscillations in the population trans-
fer as a function of the Rabi angle (i.e.
laser intensity
for a ﬁxed pulse duration) can be suppressed by chirp-
ing the dump pulse. Thus, total population inversion is
obtained for a wide range of intensities (corresponding
to Rabi angles of π to 4π in our calculations) with an
eﬀective 20% population transfer to bound levels. Em-
ploying a chirped dump pulse therefore yields a robust
scheme in which the probability to create stable ground

state molecules is 20%, independent of the exact value of
laser intensity.

±

By varying the time-delay between the two pulses, a
strong variation in the population transfer which follows
the variation of the Franck-Condon factors has been ob-
served. Only at shorter distance, the wave packet in
the excited state has good Franck-Condon overlap with
bound ground state levels, and ground state molecules
are formed by the dump pulse. The highest eﬃciency is
achieved in a narrow time window (Tvib/2
2ps) during
which the wave packet is maximally focussed at the bar-
rier. For diﬀerent time-delays, only the last two bound
levels of the ground state are populated, and a consider-
able amount of population is transferred to the contin-
uum, i.e. two free atoms are created. Note that without
a second pulse, stabilization would occur via spontaneous
emission on a nanosecond timescale. The probability for
creating ground state molecules is then given by a time
average. Since the wave packet spends more time at large
distances than close to the barrier, times with unfavor-
able Franck-Condon overlaps dominate this average. It
is therefore essential to employ a second pulse to fully
take advantage of the time-dependent probability to cre-
ate bound ground state molecules after photoassociation
with picosecond pulses.

The calculations have conﬁrmed our intuition that sta-
bilization to ground state molecules is optimal when the
excited state wave packet is close to the inner turning
point of the outer potential well. The best localization of
the wave packet at the inner barrier is brought about by
negatively chirping the pump pulse. There is yet another
advantage when using a negative chirp of the pump pulse:
The photoassociation probability is increased by a factor
of 8 as compared to a transform-limited pulse. Further-
more, the probability of creating bound molecules by the
dump pulse is enhanced by roughly a factor of 3 for a
negatively chirped pump pulse as compared to positively
chirped or transform-limited ones. The number of sta-
ble molecules formed in a pump-dump sequence can be
therefore be increased by 24 when appropriately choosing
the pulse parameters.

We have also considered a pump pulse with smaller
detuning, for which the photoassociation probability is
larger. However, due to a decrease of the Franck-Condon
overlap, even for the maximally focussed wave packet,
the stabilization step is much less eﬃcient. Therefore,

the total number of stable molecules is roughly the same
as in the previous case.

Finally, we have employed longer dump pulses with a
duration of about 3 ps to selectively populate the v′′=14
level in the ground state. Up to 12% of the photoassoci-
ated molecules can then be stabilized into a single level,
which is fairly eﬃcient. Note that these molecules are
created coherently by the pump-dump sequence.

The full discussion of the deﬁnition of the optimal pulse
should include the possibility of a repetition scheme, con-
sidering further pump and dump pulses.
In treating a
repetition scheme, we also have to take into account how
the pump and dump pulses modify the continuum wave
function describing two colliding atoms. This is beyond
the scope of the present study.

In conclusion, a two-color pump-dump scheme is rather
promising for the creation of stable cold molecules. Due
to the choice of the Cs2 0−
g potential for the photoasso-
ciation step , the present work has analyzed formation of
molecules in the v′′=14 level of the ground triplet state,
bound by 113 cm−1. Many other schemes, e.g. [15, 33],
are possible and should be considered to bring population
into the v′′=0 level of the ground state which will open
the way to the formation of stable molecular condensates.
In this respect, we would like to point out the generality
of the two-color pump-dump scheme which only requires
eﬃcient photoassociation and stabilization mechanisms
involving either long range wells in the excited poten-
tials [34] or resonant coupling [16, 17, 18], but is not
restricted to a particular system.

APPENDIX A: A NOTE ON THE
REPRESENTATION OF CONTINUUM STATES
WITH A MAPPED FOURIER GRID

The Fourier grid employs a ﬁnite number of grid points
and periodic boundary conditions to represent a quan-
0, this corresponds to
tum wave function. For V (R)
the particle in a box problem. The scattering continuum
is hence represented by a ﬁnite number of discrete box
states. The highest momentum which is correctly rep-

≡

13

resented on the grid is given in terms of the (constant)
spacing ∆R between two grid points, pmax = π/∆R.

In order to model long-range interactions which require
large grids but not small grid steps, a mapping procedure
is introduced. The grid steps in the asymptotic region
become very large, correspondingly high momenta are
cut oﬀ. This alters the representation of continuum states
on the grid. When diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, two
kinds of continuum eigenfunctions are obtained: true box
levels and wave functions with an unphysical shape. The
latter will be called “cutoﬀ-states” in the following.

The box levels can be easily identiﬁed by the scaling
n2 (except for the ﬁrst few
of their eigenenergies, En ∼
states just above the dissociation limit where the energies
are perturbed by the threshold). The corresponding wave
functions are standing waves of the box.

∼

The eigenenergies of the cutoﬀ-states approximately
scale with some high power (
20) of the box index, the
highest eigenenergy being determined by the largest al-
lowed grid step which is a parameter of the mapping.
The corresponding eigenfunctions show very fast oscil-
lations and don’t obey the boundary conditions at Rmin
and Rmax. It can nevertheless be shown that these cutoﬀ-
states constitute an eﬀective representation of the true,
physical continuum for energies higher than the energy of
the last true box level. To this end, the Franck-Condon
overlaps of an excited state wave function with the eigen-
functions of all ground state levels (i.e. bound, box and
cutoﬀ-levels) are calculated and compared (i) for diﬀerent
mapping parameters and (ii) to Franck-Condon overlaps
obtained by Numerov integration [35].

In the ﬁrst set of calculations, the largest allowed grid
step, ∆Rmax, is varied. The Hamiltonian is diagonalized
for each ∆Rmax and an increasing number of grid points,
NR. For each ∆Rmax, the number of cutoﬀ-states turns
out to be independent of NR, i.e. increasing NR leads to
a larger number of true box states. In particular, for the
smallest ∆Rmax and largest NR used (∆Rmax = 0.33 a0,
NR = 8191), a continuum representation is obtained
which contains almost no cutoﬀ-states (168 vs. 7969 true
box states). The excited state wave function is then in-
terpolated to these grids, and the Franck-Condon over-
laps are computed. Note, that the Franck-Condon over-
laps for continuum states need to include the correct en-
ergy renormalization [21]. The Franck-Condon overlaps
turn out to be roughly independent of the grid param-
eters. We are particularly interested in the sum over
the Franck-Condon overlaps which determines the prob-
ability of dissociating the excited state molecules into
hot, free atoms with a short dump pulse (cf. Sec. IV).
This sum is roughly constant for all grids considered,
varying between 0.21 for ∆Rmax = 33 a0 and 0.17 for
∆Rmax = 0.33 a0. The variation is caused by the in-
terpolation of the excited state wave function to the new
grids which is not exact, the approximation getting worse
for decreasing ∆Rmax.

In a second set of calculations, Franck-Condon overlaps
with all ground state levels were calculated for selected

excited state vibrational levels with both the mapped
Fourier grid and the Numerov method. Oscillations like
those in Fig. 10 are observed. The resolution of these
oscillations in the mapped Fourier grid method depends

on the number of grid points, NR. Good agreement be-
tween the two methods is obtained for NR = 1023, the
value used throughout Secs. IV and V.

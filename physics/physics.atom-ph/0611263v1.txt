In this article we present a new perturbation method for hydrogen-like systems with a spinless
orbiting particle.We apply the perturbation theory to an exact linearized version of the Klein-
Gordon equation obtained by a rescaling of the mass and the energy of the system. For this reason,
the relativistic corrections are automatically included. The predictions obtained are compared and
tested against an other perturbation approach that uses the Feshbach-Villars formalism and with a
self-consistent calculation. We use this new perturbation method to calculate the hyperﬁne structure
of pionic and kaonic atoms providing an additional term in the calculation of the energy transition
of these systems. Such a correction is required for a recent measurement of the pion mass.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last few years transition energies in pionic [1]
and kaonic atoms [2] have been measured with an un-
precedented precision. The spectroscopy of pionic and
kaonic hydrogen allows to study the strong interaction
at low energies [3, 4, 5] by measuring the energy and
natural width of the ground level with a precision of few
meV [6, 7, 8]. Besides, light pionic atoms can addition-
ally be used to deﬁne new low-energy X-ray standards [9]
and to evaluate the pion mass using high accuracy X-ray
spectroscopy [10, 11, 12, 13]. Similar endeavour are in
progress with kaonic atoms [2]

Strong interaction and mass measurements require pre-
cise calculations of the pure electromagnetic contribution
of the atomic energy levels. To reach a precision of a
few parts per million (ppm), Quantum Electrodynamics
(QED) and relativistic corrections have to be calculated
accurately. For spinless particles, the Klein-Gordon (KG)
equation has to be used to take into account the relativis-
tic eﬀects. Additional contributions as hyperﬁne struc-
ture (HFS) and recoil corrections have to be calculated
using perturbation methods. Due to the non-linearity of
the KG equation, the usual perturbation theory cannot
be directly applied as in the case of the Schr¨odinger and
Dirac equations, and other techniques have to be used.
In this paper we present a new perturbation method for
the KG equation. One way to do perturbative calcula-
tions in the KG equation is to use the Feshbach-Villars
formalism, which transforms the second order KG equa-
tion into two ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations [14, 15].
An other way is to extract the energy correction manip-
ulating the KG equation with and without perturbation
operator [16, 17]. Here we use an alternative method
that uses as the starting point an exact linearization of
the KG equation obtained via an energy rescaling. All

methods provide similar results taking into account the
relativistic eﬀects to all the orders. We test the valid-
ity of such methods comparing their predictions for the
vacuum polarization with a self-consistent calculation.

Using the formalism presented here, we then calcu-
late the hyperﬁne structure in pionic and kaonic atoms
considering the perturbation term due to the interaction
between the pion or kaon orbital magnetic moment with
the magnetic momentum of the nucleus. In particular,
we calculate the HFS energy splitting for pionic nitrogen,
which has been used for a recent measurement of the pion
mass aiming at an accuracy of few ppm [10, 11, 13, 18],
and for kaonic nitrogen that has been proposed for the
kaon mass measurement [2].

This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II we will
develop the perturbation method starting from the Klein-
Gordon equation. In Sec. III, we calculate and compare
the vacuum polarization and nuclear ﬁnite size contribu-
tions using diﬀerent methods. Section IV is dedicated
to the calculation of the hyperﬁne structure term and
includes numerical results for some pionic and kaonic
atoms.

II. CALCULATION OF THE ENERGY
CORRECTION

The relativistic dynamic of a spinless particle is de-
scribed by the Klein-Gordon equation. The electromag-
netic interaction between a negatively charged spin-0 par-
ticle with a charge equal to q =
e and the nucleus can
be taken into account introducing the nuclear quadrivec-
tor portential Aν in the KG equation via the minimal
qAν [19]. In particular, in the case of
pν −
coupling pν →
a central Coulomb potential (V0(r), 0), the KG equation
for a particle with a mass µ is:

−

The ﬁrst correction term to the energy can be calcu-

The two expressions diﬀer already in order of (Zα)2
with a term proportional to (Zα)2/n2. Such a diﬀer-
ence comes from the diﬀerent approach of the perturba-
tion methods and cannot be explained from the formulas
above. However, the two perturbation techniques can be
compared to each other and with a self-consistent calcu-
lation, where all order perturbation terms are included.
The most probable is that this diﬀerence is canceled out
by higher order terms. Equation (15) is very suitable
for implementation in our code, as it does not require
evaluation of new quantities. As an example we take the
perturbation due to the vacuum polarization which will
be calculated in the next section using both formalisms.

III. THE VACUUM POLARIZATION AND
NUCLEAR FINITE SIZE CORRECTIONS

In this section we calculate the energy correction due to
the vacuum polarization and the ﬁnite size of the nucleus
in several pionic atoms with diﬀerent atomic number Z
to compare the perturbative results with a self-consistent
calculation. This calculation has been performed us-
ing the multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) code de-
veloped by one of the author (P.I.) and J.-P. Desclaux
[21, 22, 23, 24] that has been modiﬁed to include spin-0
particles case, even in the presence of electrons [25]. In
this code, the vacuum polarization and the ﬁnite size of
the nucleus can be taken into account self-consistently
introducing a correction V1(r) of the Coulomb potential
into the Klein-Gordon equation, and solving it numeri-
cally to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions [23, 25].
In the perturbation method, the vacuum polarization
and nuclear ﬁnite size energy corrections are obtained
by adding a perturbation V1 to the Coulomb potential
in Eq. (1) and deriving the corresponding perturbation
operator W . Considering only the ﬁrst order correction,
we have:

W (r) =

2e2V0(r)V1(r) + 2eE V1(r)

.

In our case, V1 consist in two independent contribution:
V1(r) = δVV P (r) + δVF S(r) with δVV P (r) is due to the
vacuum polarization and δVF S(r) to the nuclear ﬁnite
size.

We consider here only the ﬁrst order correction for the
vacuum polarization and nuclear ﬁnite size. Mixed ef-
fects of vacuum polarization and ﬁnite size and vacuum
polarization have not been taken into account in the per-
turbation method. For this reason, we restrict our study
to a few orbitals with a characteristic radius rn much
1/2 of the nu-
r2
larger than the mean square radius
N i
h
cleus charge distribution.
In particular we studied the
orbital 5g, 7i and 9l, where we chose the highest quan-
tum number ℓ to minimize the eﬀect of the ﬁnite size of
the nucleus.

We compare in addition these relativistic calculations
to the non-relativistic ones, obtained using the clas-
sical perturbation theory to the Schr¨odinger equation
(Eq. (16)). Nuclear masses and radii and pion mass value
are obtained from Refs. [28, 29, 30].

The results are presented in Tables I, II and III and
Figs. 1 and 2. As expected, there is a noticeable diﬀer-
ence between the non-relativistic and relativistic pertur-
bation predictions. The values provided by the linerized
and non-linerized KG equation perturbation approaches
are very close to the self-consistent prediction. These dif-
ferences can be compared with estimated error consider-
ing the second order non-relativistic perturbation correc-
tion and the numerical calculation accuracy represented
in the error bars.

As we can observe in Fig. 2, non-relativistic and rela-
tivistic approaches diﬀer signiﬁcantly for high values of
Z.
In contrast, the relativistic prediction of the linear
equation and quadratic equation perturbations are very
close as expected from Eqs. (18) and (19). For levels like
5g and 7i we can observe a consistent systematic devi-
ation from the all-order treatment that can be justiﬁed

of the neglected higher order perturbation terms (rep-

to draw any clear cut conclusion: both predictions do
not diﬀer by more than two standard deviations from
the all-order calculation. We can only suppose that this
systematic deviation between the two relativistic pertur-

the higher order perturbation terms not considered here.

IV. THE HYPERFINE STRUCTURE IN PIONIC
AND KAONIC ATOMS

Linear equation perturbation
Linear equation perturbation
Quadratic equation perturbation
Quadratic equation perturbation
Non-relativistic perturbation
Non-relativistic perturbation

The hyperﬁne structure in pionic and kaonic atoms
arises from the interaction between the nuclear magnetic
moment and the orbital magnetic moment of the particle
that can be taken into account by introducing a new term
in the KG equation.

This term is obtained from the multipole development
of the nuclear electromagnetic ﬁeld [31, 32, 33]. Non-
relativistic calculations for the pionic atom hyperﬁne
structure can be found in Ref. [34, 35, 36]. Other theoret-
ical predictions for HFS including relativistic corrections
can be found only for spin- 1
2 nucleus [37, 38]. Contrary to
these methods, our technique is not restricted to this case
and it can be used for an arbitrary value of the nucleus
spin including automatically the relativistic eﬀects.

these cases, vacuum polarization and ﬁnite size mixed contri-

results.

A. Calculation of the operator

The expression for W (r) in the HFS case is derived
using the multipole development of the vector potential
A(r) in the Coulomb gauge [32]. We neglect here the
eﬀect due to the the spatial distribution of the nuclear
magnetic moment in the nucleus [39] (Bohr-Weisskopf
eﬀect), while eﬀect due to the charge distribution (Bohr-
Rosenthal eﬀect) are included.

The hyperﬁne structure due to the magnetic dipole
interaction is obtained by taking into account the ﬁrst
magnetic multipole term. Using the Coulomb gauge [31,
32] we have:

A(r) =

√2r−2C11

implies that the reduced matrix elements of U 1 and V 1

B. Numerical results and behaviors

We present here some calculations for a selection of
pionic and kaonic atom transitions. The ﬁrst part is
dedicated to the 5
4 transitions in pionic nitrogen,
essential to deduce a pion mass value from a recent mea-
surement of the 5g
4f transition in pionic nitrogen
[10, 11, 12, 13, 18] and for the proposed kaon mass mea-
surement [2]. In the second part we will study the de-
pendence of the HFS splitting against Z to observe the
role of the relativistic corrections.

The precise measurement of 5g

4f transition in pi-
onic nitrogen and the related QED predictions allow for
the precise measurement of the pion mass. In the same
way, the transition 8k
7i in kaonic nitrogen can be
used for a precise mass measurement of the kaon[2]. For
this transitions, strong interaction eﬀects between meson
and nucleus are negligible, and the level energies are di-
rectly dependent to the reduced mass of the atom. The
nuclear spin of the nitrogen isotope 14N is equal to one
leading to the presence of several HFS sublevels. The
observed transition is a combination of several diﬀerent
transitions between these sublevels, causing a shift that
has to be taken into account to extract the pion mass
from the experimental values. Transition probabilities
between HFS sublevels can easily be calculated using the
non-relativistic formula [27, 43] (the role of the relativis-
tic eﬀects is here negligible), if one neglect the HFS con-
tribution to the transition energy:

[28]. The Coulomb term in the Table includes
Ref.
the non-relativistic recoil correction using the reduced
mass on the KG equation. The pion and nucleus charge
distribution contribution are also included. The pion
charge distribution radius contribution is included fol-
lowing [25, 44]. For the pion charge distribution ra-
dius we take rpion = 0.672

loop contribution to all orders, at the Uehling approxima-
tion. This is obtained by including the Uehling potential
into the KG equation [23]. Other Higher-order vacuum
polarization contribution are calculated as perturbation
to the KG equations: Wichman-Kroll and K¨all´en-Sabry
[45, 46]. The self-energy is calculated using the expres-
sion in Ref. [47] and it includes the recoil correction. The
Relativistic recoil term has been evaluated adapting the
formulas from Refs. [38, 48] (more details can be found
in Ref. [13]). The calculations presented here do not take
into account second order recoil eﬀects (Fig. 3 top), or
higher QED corrections as vacuum polarization and self-
energy mixed diagrams (Fig. 3 botton). The contribution
from these terms has been estimated using the formula
for a spin- 1
2 particle with a mass equal to the pion’s.

larization and self-energy mixed diagrams contribute in
the order of 1 meV for the diagram with the vacuum
polarization loop in the nuclear photon line [49] (Fig. 3
bottom-left), and 0.0006 meV for the diagram with the
vacuum polarization loop inside the self-energy loop [50]
(Fig. 3 bottom-right). The second order recoil contribu-
tions are in the order of 0.04 meV [51] (Fig. 3 top). The
largest contribution comes from the unevaluated diagram
with the vacuum polarization loop in the nuclear photon
line [49].

Assuming a statistical population distribution of the
HFS sublevels, we can use Eq. (47) to calculate the mean
value of the transitions using the results in Table IV B 1.
Comparing this calculation with the one without the
HFS, we obtain a value for the HFS shift. For transi-
4d we obtain shifts of 0.8 and
tions 5g
2.2 meV, respectively. These values correspond to a cor-

The transition energies for the 8

7 transitions in
kaonic nitrogen are presented in Tables VI and IV B 1.
As for the pionic nitrogen, the error contribution due
to the QED correction not considered is dominated by
the unevaluated diagram with the vacuum polarization
loop in the nuclear photon line [49], the associated cor-
7i
rection is estimated in the order of 0.5 meV. For 8k
and 8i
7h transitions we have a HFS shift of 0.6 and
0.8 meV, respectively, which correspond to a correction
of the kaon mass between 0.2 and 0.3 ppm.

→

As a general note, we remark that if we assume a sta-
tistical distribution of the initial state sublevels popula-
n′s with a s orbital as ﬁnal state
tions, transitions nl
have an average HFS shift equal to zero due to an ex-
act cancellation between the weighted excited sublevels
energy shifts as seen from Eq. (47).

2. General behavior of the hyperﬁne structure correction
over Z

For the non-relativistic case, the HFS splitting normal-
ized to the binding energy and to the nuclear magnetic
moment, depends linearly on Zα. Any deviation from
this linear dependence in the Klein-Gordon HFS can be
attributed only to relativistic eﬀects.

E9p

F =3/2 −

F =3/2)/(

To study the behavior of the normalized HFS splitting
(E9p
E0µI ) for the relativistic case, we
calculated the HFS for a selected choice of pionic atoms
with a stable nucleus of spin 1/2. The orbital 9p has
been chosen to minimize the eﬀect of the ﬁnite nuclear
size and strong interaction shifts, particularly for high
values of Z. The results are summarized in Table IV B 2.
For these calculations we used the nuclear mass values
from Ref. [28], the nuclear radii from Refs. [29, 52] and
the nuclear magnetic moments from Ref. [53].

For higher Z values a non-linear dependence on Zα
appears as we can see in Fig. IV B 2. This non-linearity
originates in the two diﬀerent parts of Eq. (46): the non-
trivial dependency on
E0 in the denominator and the ex-
nl
pectation value

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented here a new perturbation method
for the Klein-Gordon equation in bound systems, that
is very easy to implement in computer codes. We ap-
ply this new method to calculate the HFS of pionic and
kaonic atoms using the formalism presented in this pa-
per. The precise evaluation of the speciﬁc case of pionic
and kaonic nitrogen is particularly important for the new
measurement of the pion and kaon mass. The small error
on the theoretical predictions, of the order of 1 meV for
the 5
4 transition, corresponds to a systematic error
0.34 ppm for the pion mass evaluation, considerably
of
smaller than the error of previous theoretical predictions

The perturbation method for the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion has been used for the calculation of the HFS of pi-
onic atoms, but it can be applied to diﬀerent types of

10

perturbation. For mesonic atoms with high Z, the nu-
clear quadrupole moment may not be negligible. The
eﬀect of such moments can be easily evaluated using the
same perturbation method.
In this case, HFS due to
the quadrupole moment can be predicted using the next
multipole in the development of the electric potential of
the nucleus to evaluate the correspondent perturbation
operator. In the same way, strong interaction eﬀects can
be taken into account introducing the optical potential
[36, 55] as perturbation. These two applications are very
important for the calculation of the atomic levels in heavy
pionic ions, where the relativistic eﬀects, automatically
taken into account by the KG equation, are not negligi-
ble.

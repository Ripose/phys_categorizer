We study how the spectral properties of resonance ﬂuorescence propagate through a two–atom
system. Within the weak–driving–ﬁeld approximation we ﬁnd that, as we go from one atom to
the next, the power spectrum exhibits both sub–natural linewidth narrowing and large asymmetries
while the spectrum of squeezing narrows but remains otherwise unchanged. Analytical results for the
observed spectral features of the ﬂuorescence are provided and their origin is thoroughly discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the prediction [1] and observation [2] of the three–peaked ﬂuorescence spectrum of a strongly driven two–
level atom, the spectral features of atomic ﬂuorescence have both provided fundamental insight into the photon–atom
interaction and revealed a variety of interesting quantum features. Photon anti–bunching together with sub–Poissonian
counting statistics have long been predicted [3–5] and experimentally observed [6–8]. The phenomenon of squeezing
in resonance ﬂuorescence has also been the object of a rather intense research activity [9,10]. Most of this work
has concerned itself with the non–classical features of ﬂuorescence from an atom excited by a classical light source,
typically a coherent light beam. Over the past decade much interest has also been devoted to the issue of an atom
driven by a non–classical light source. In the pioneering work of Gardiner [11], Carmichael [12], Zoller [13] and their
co-workers this was most commonly studied by considering a model of a two-level atom interacting with a broad-band
squeezed vacuum. In spite of its simplicity such a model has brought forward quite a number of interesting predictions,
of which the inhibition of the atomic dipole decay due to the reduced quantum ﬂuctuations of the squeezed vacuum
reservoir is perhaps the most ubiquitous one. These early results have stimulated much interest [14] on the issue of
exciting atomic systems with more realistic forms of non–classical light such as, e.g., narrow band–width squeezed
light [15], antibunched [16] and thermal [17,18] light, and the ﬂuorescence from a high–Q atomic cavity [19]. Amongst
the latest successes on the ﬁeld, it is certainly worth mentioning a landmark experiment on trapped Cesium atoms
carried out by Kimble and co–workers [20]; they showed that the two–photon atomic excitation rate, which is typically
quadratic with the intensity of the exciting ﬁeld, may become instead linear for an exciting squeezed light ﬁeld as
long anticipated by the theory [21,22].

Along this line we investigate in this paper how spectral properties of atomic ﬂuorescence are modiﬁed by an
atomic medium where succeeding atoms are driven only by the output of the previous one with no feedback. Here, in
particular, we study the case of two atoms one of which is driven by a coherent light beam. Since non–classical eﬀects in
atomic ﬂuorescence usually take place for weak–ﬁeld excitations we calculate the power and noise (squeezing) spectrum
of the ﬂuorescence emitted by each of the two atoms in the weak–ﬁeld limit. The atomic correlations functions needed
to obtain such spectra have recently been derived in [23] by using a weak–ﬁeld perturbative approach; the main
expressions for the correlation functions are thus brieﬂy stated in Sec. II while the expressions for the power and
noise spectral density of the ﬂuorescent light are explicitly derived in Sec. III and IV, respectively. The physical
interpretation of these results is also given in these last two sections while a summary and conclusions are given in
Sec. V.

II. CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

Consider a collection of identical two–state atoms, whose energy levels are separated by ¯hω0, interacting with
the radiation ﬁeld via dipole interaction. Let σ−,n(t) be the lowering operator for the nth atomic dipole, Rn(t)
be the population inversion operator and A(+)(rn, t) be the positive frequency part of the vector potential of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld at the position of the nth dipole. In terms of the slowly–varying dynamical variables bn(t) ≡

f ree(r, t)

The ﬁrst term is the well–known expression for the ﬁeld radiated by an oscillating dipole located at rn, while the
second term is the source–free ﬁeld contribution that has excited the dipole.

The degree of ﬁrst and second–order coherence needed to evaluate the spectrum of the resonance ﬂuorescence and
the spectrum of squeezing can be derived from Eq.(3) using the solutions of the coupled diﬀerential equations Eqs.(1-2)
for each atomic dipole in the collection. In particular, the system of Eqs. (1-2) can be transformed into two coupled
integral equations which can be solved, in the weak-ﬁeld limit, by a perturbative technique when the external driving
ﬁeld only couples to the ﬁrst atom and each succeeding atom of the collection is driven only by the output of the
previous one, with no feedback.

This approach, which is discussed in detail in [23], is applied here to a system of two atoms; the second atom is
placed outside the ﬁeld which drives the ﬁrst one and the ﬂuorescence feeding back onto the ﬁrst atom can be clearly
assumed to be very small when compared to that driving the second atom. When the ﬁeld impinging on the ﬁrst
atom is a single–mode coherent state the steady–state atomic correlation functions, for the ﬁrst and second atom are

The spectrum (13), which recovers a known result for the ﬂuorescence spectral density of a weakly driven two-level
atom [24,1], consists of two Lorentzian contributions symmetrically displaced with respect to the driving frequency
1 (r, ω) through the relative coupling strength of the two
ωL by an amount ±∆. The spectrum (14), proportional to SE
atomic dipoles, comprises a static and a Lorentzian contribution which is centered at the value ∆ of the detuning.
Since s1 << 1, the static term can be neglected for the spectral frequencies of interest.

The ﬁnite bandwidth of the spectral densities (13) and (14) has here a signiﬁcance that is diﬀerent from its
signiﬁcance in the process of atomic spontaneous emission into the vacuum. An excited atom has only a ﬁnite amount
of stored energy and can radiate only for a ﬁnite time, so that the width of the spectral density has to be ﬁnite in
spontaneous emission. However, in our problem we are dealing with an atom that is continuously excited by a strictly
monochromatic ﬁeld and the ﬁnite size of the linewidth is due to the quantum ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld driving the
atom.

This is already evident, e.g., in the sub-natural width of the light emitted by the ﬁrst atom for zero detuning. This
sub-natural narrowing is experimentally [25] well established and can be attributed to the atomic dipole ﬂuctuations
induced by the coherent exciting ﬁeld. The spectrum (11) can in fact be decomposed into two independent contri-
butions each one describing the ﬂuctuations in–phase and out–of–phase (quadrature) with the mean induced atomic
dipole. In the weak ﬁeld limit these two contributions sum up to yield the squared Lorentzian form of the spectrum
(13) responsible for the sub-natural linewidth narrowing [26,19,27].

The two spectra (13) and (14) are integrated over the whole solid angle, assuming that all emitted light is collected
by a detector with perfect eﬃciency (η=1), and are plotted in Fig. 1 and 2. The case of zero detuning is discussed ﬁrst
(Fig. 1). By comparing the analytical expressions of both spectral densities for ∆ = 0 we observe that SE
2 (ω), which
goes like the third power of the inverse frequency square, falls oﬀ more rapidly than SE
1 (ω) does. This produces a
narrowing in the lineshape of the light emitted by the second atom as compared to that of the ﬁrst atom. Physically,

marani2

such a narrowing arises from the fact that the quantum ﬂuctuations in the ﬁeld that drives the second atom are
reduced (squeezed) below the vacuum value pertaining to those of the (classical) ﬁeld that drives the ﬁrst atom. It
is to be noted here that the narrowing should be a phase–dependent eﬀect which is not apparent in our case; this is
because the squeezing phase in the ﬁeld exciting the second atom cannot be varied at will but it has a ﬁxed relationship
with the phase of the ﬁeld driving the ﬁrst atom. Phase-sensitive sub–natural linewidth narrowing in the ideal system
of a (monochromatic) laser driven two–level atom in a broad–band squeezed vacuum has been investigated and we
may refer, e.g., to the work of Carmichael [12], Ficek [28] and Courty [29].

The case of non–zero detuning exhibits a somewhat more complex physics and will be discussed next (Fig.2). The
light emitted by the ﬁrst atom exhibits a symmetric spectrum with maxima at both positive and negative values of
the detuning. Such a symmetry originates from the fact that the two Lorentzian contributions in (13) are equally
displaced from ωL so that for suﬃciently large ∆’s these two components can be far enough apart to make up a well
separated doublet whose central dip will decrease as the separation of the two Lorentzians increases. In the limit of
vanishing detunings, this well separated doublet merges into a single line centered at resonance.

In the dressed-atom approach of resonance ﬂuorescence [30] the symmetric doublet spectrum, e.g., can be seen to
originate from the suppression of the central peak of the ﬂuorescence triplet in the spontaneous transitions between
the (ﬁrst) atom’s dressed levels

Physically, the symmetry of the doublet originates from the fact that, in the weak–ﬁeld limit, the detuned atom
responds to the absorption of two laser photons by emitting two photons shifted in frequencies by opposite amounts
with respect to ωL, to satisfy energy conservation.

The spectrum of the ﬂuorescence emitted by the second atom displays a strong asymmetry in the peak heights in
addition to an eﬀect of linewidth narrowing. The dominant term in (14) does not only produce the narrowing but
it is also responsible for the asymmetric double–peak structure of the spectrum. Narrowing of the linewidth is again
caused by the squeezing in the ﬁeld driving the second atom in much the same way as for the undetuned atom.

The quenching of ﬂuorescence at the lower energy peak, which gives rise to the asymmetry, can instead be explained
as follows. The total spectrum emitted by the ﬁrst atom is given by the sum of the incoherent part of the spectrum
(Eq.(13)) and the coherent contribution, given by SE
1,coh(ω) = [η|ǫ1|/β]s0(1 − 2s0)βδ(ω − ωL). For appropriately
large detunings the light impinging on the second atom draws contributions from a range of scattered frequencies ωsc
spread over the interval [ω0 − 2∆ − β, ω0 + β] and consisting in the peak of coherently scattered radiation at the laser
frequency ωL and the two side peaks of incoherently scattered radiation centered at about ω0 − 2∆ and ω0 according
to Eq. (13). The ﬁnite bandwidth of the exciting radiation can give rise to asymmetric spectra as discussed, e.g., in
[24]. In fact, each incident mode ω scatters into a two–peak spectrum having one peak on resonance and the other at
2ω − ω0; therefore for each frequency ω, the resonant component of the spectrum is enhanced resulting in a stronger
on-resonance peak whereas the oﬀ-resonance contributions are smeared over the spectrum. The coherently scattered
radiation from the ﬁrst atom is monochromatic like the light of the incident laser beam, thus it yields a symmetric
contribution of the same form of the ﬂuorescence spectrum of the ﬁrst atom, i.e. the ﬁrst term on the right hand
side of Eq.(14). The incoherent ﬂuorescence from the ﬁrst atom gives rise to the asymmetric second term; this term
represents the contribution from single-photon absorption–emission processes by the second atom, which enhance
mainly the resonant peak.

IV. SPECTRUM OF SQUEEZING

The resonance ﬂuorescence radiated by a two–level atom driven by coherent light exhibits the phenomenon of
squeezing [31]. This eﬀect is typically revealed by using a phase–sensitive homodyned detection scheme [23,32]. In
such a scheme the atomic ﬂuorescence is mixed by means of a symmetric beam splitter with the highly coherent light
of a local oscillator of the same frequency. Squeezing in the signal beam can be assessed by measuring the normally
ordered and time ordered intensity correlation function

λ(t1, t2) ≡

< T : I(t1)I(t2) :>
< I(t1) >< I(t2) >

− 1,

where I is the intensity of the mixed ﬁeld at the detector.

the ﬂuorescence scattered from the n-th atom is given by:

where tn,r ≡ t − ω0|r − rn|/c is the typical retardation time, ψn ≡ φLO + (π/2) − (ω0|r − rn|/c) and φLO is the local
oscillator phase. In homodyne detection the local oscillator frequency ωLO is equal to the laser frequency ωL. In the
stationary regime λn(r, t, t + τ ) depends only on τ , and its Fourier transform yields the spectrum of squeezing

The phase of the local oscillator φLO is chosen so as to yield maximum squeezing for ﬁxed values of the Rabi frequency
and detuning. This occurs when the intensity correlation function (16) acquires the highest negative value for τ = 0,
so that ψ1 = φ+ and ψ2 = 2φ+ + (π/2) for the ﬁrst and second atom, respectively, as can be inferred from Eqs.(6)
and (9). In general, the contribution from the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (16) to the noise spectrum (17) can

The spectrum (18) is consistent with the weak–ﬁeld limit of a known expression for the noise spectrum [10,32], while
(20) is a new result.

In Fig. 3 we plot the spectrum (18) and (20) (squeezed quadrature) for an undetuned atom and suitably normalized
to the outgoing intensity while the same is done for a detuned atom in Fig. 4. The outgoing intensity is given by
n(t)bn(t) > |ǫn(r)|2. We ﬁrst observe that for both detuned and undetuned atom the noise bandwidth narrows as
< b†
the ﬂuorescence propagates from one atom to the next because in general the atom–radiation coupling lengthens the
characteristic correlation time of the scattered ﬂuorescence [23]. This is also consistent with the ﬁndings of Gardiner
et al [33] for a two–level atom excited by squeezed light from a degenerate parametric ampliﬁer. Furthermore, one
can see that for an undetuned atom maximum squeezing is seen to arise in a narrow band around ω = 0 where it
reaches an absolute value of about 12% after the ﬁrst atom, which conﬁrms the result found in [9,10,32], but reduces
to 5 × 10−3% after the second atom. Note that in the latter case the very small amount of noise reduction is due to
the fact that the eﬀective Rabi frequency for the second atom is about 10−2 times smaller than that for the ﬁrst atom.
For a detuned atom, on the other hand, the amount of squeezing is generally smaller with largest values occurring
over sidebands centered around ±∆. For ∆ = 2β (Fig. 4) a maximum absolute squeezing of about 1% is observed
after the ﬁrst atom but drops again to 1 × 10−4% after the second one.

Finally we see that the ﬂuorescence from the ﬁrst atom exhibits homogeneous squeezing (i.e. squeezing is present
at all frequencies), while, for detunings greater than 2β, the ﬂuorescence from the second atom is squeezed only for

frequencies between the side minima. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows a contour plot of the noise spectrum
2 (r, ω, +) normalized to the outgoing intensity as a function of frequency and detuning. The white area represents
SN
positive values (indicating that the light is not squeezed at the corresponding frequency) while darker colors indicate
increasing negative values.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we calculate the eﬀect of propagation through an atomic medium on the spectral properties of
resonance ﬂuorescence. For a two-atom system, where the ﬁrst atom is excited by a coherent light source and the
second one only by the ﬂuorescence scattered by the ﬁrst one (no feedback), we provide analytical expressions for the
ﬂuorescence linewidth and for the ﬂuorescence quantum noise. Such a simple system oﬀers the advantage of analytical
results which enable one to stress on the basic diﬀerences between the spectral signatures of the ﬂuorescence scattered
by an atom driven by the a classical (ﬁrst) and non–classical (second) light ﬁeld. In the weak–ﬁeld regime we observe
narrowing of the linewidth, reductions of the quantum noise bandwidth and an appreciable population trapping eﬀect.
The mechanisms for line–narrowing after the ﬁrst and second atom are diﬀerent from one another. The quite small
linewidth narrowing after the ﬁrst atom is described by Eq.(13) and originates from the fact that the interaction
between the atom and a coherent laser source produces squeezing of the atomic dipole–ﬂuctuations in phase with the
mean induced dipole moment. Further narrowing after the second atom, which is described by the square bracket
term on the right hand side of Eq.(14), results from the interaction of the (second) atom with the squeezed radiation
coming oﬀ the ﬁrst one. The reduction of the spectral width of quantum ﬂuctuations in the ﬂuorescence of the ﬁrst
and second atom is instead described by the expressions (18) and (20) and it is due to photon–photon correlations
originating in the process of resonance ﬂuorescence. A similar noise bandwidth narrowing has been found by Gardiner
and coworkers [33] in the squeezing spectra of an atom subject to incident squeezed light of ﬁnite bandwidth.

Unlike the eﬀect of linewidth narrowing, which occurs for both detuned and undetuned atoms, population trapping
takes place only for non–vanishing detunings after the second atom. Such a quenching of the ﬂuorescence results
from the asymmetry introduced by the second square bracket in Eq.(14) and it is here interpreted as due to the
enhancement of the resonant component of the ﬁnite-bandwidth radiation impinging on the second atom (Fig. 2).
The asymmetry we observe, however, resembles much those found in the ﬂuorescence spectra of a two-level atom
damped by a squeezed vacuum. By adopting the radiative cascade approach within the dressed–atom picture of
resonance ﬂuorescence, Courty and Reynaud [30], e.g., investigated the ﬂuorescence from an atom in a cavity in
the presence of a squeezed vacuum (oﬀ–resonance case); they found a suppression of a Rabi sideband of the power
spectrum for suitable values of the relative phase between the driving ﬁeld and the squeezed vacuum. More recently
Cabrillo and coworkers [34] have examined the weak–ﬁeld spectral response of a (single–mode) laser detuned two-level
atom in the presence of a broad–band squeezed vacuum and found asymmetric spectral features similar to those we
report in Fig. 2. Alike the atom studied in the afore mentioned works, our (second) atom is driven by the squeezed
ﬂuorescence emitted by the ﬁrst one and the asymmetry in the power spectrum of the second atom may, in fact, be
ascribed to two–photon correlations (squeezing) in the driving ﬂuorescence.

It is worth mentioning at last that for appropriate values of the detuning the two–atom system that we examine
here is remarkably similar to the one of an atom driven by a bichromatic ﬁeld with one resonant and one oﬀ–
resonant component of the same intensity. The dynamical and spectral features of such an apparently simple atomic
conﬁguration have been investigated in a surprisingly small number of experiments; yet such a system is expected to
exhibit quite a rich physics that ranges from parametric [35] and Rabi sub-harmonic resonances [36] to two–photon
optical gain and lasing [37]. The compact analytical results derived here may then be of help in understanding the
not so obvious spectral features of the ﬂuorescence from a two–level atom under bichromatic and weak excitation [38].
Work in this direction is under way [39].

Some of the features discussed in our work represent rather unusual consequences of the interaction of an atom
with non–classical light and their experimental observation, though very diﬃcult, would be a demonstration of how
strikingly quantum correlations could modify the response of an atom at a fundamental level.

We are grateful to C. Cabrillo and P. Zhou for enlightening suggestions.

[26] Already in ref. [1] Mollow notes that the form of the spectrum (12) (zero detuning) can be attributed to the addition of

two Lorentzian components, one of which appears with negative weight.

FIG. 1. Spectrum of the ﬂuorescence scattered by the ﬁrst (dashed line) and by the second (solid line) atom on resonance.
For all curves Ω/β = 0.3. For direct comparison the spectra (12) and (13) have been scaled so as to acquire the value of unit
at the atomic transition frequency, i.e. at ω = ∆.

FIG. 2. Spectrum of the ﬂuorescence scattered by the ﬁrst (dashed line) and by the second (solid line) atom for detuning

∆/β = 2. The other parameters and the scaling are the same as in Fig. 1

FIG. 3. Normalized spectrum of squeezing in the ﬂuorescence scattered by the ﬁrst atom (dashed line) and by the second

atom (solid line) for no detuning, Ω/β = 0.3, ψ1 = φ+, ψ2 = 2φ+ + (π/2) and ξ2/β = 0.02.

FIG. 4. Normalized spectrum of squeezing in the ﬂuorescence scattered by the ﬁrst atom (dashed line) and by the second

atom (solid line) for ∆/β = 2, Ω/β = 0.3, ξ2/β = 0.02, ψ1 = φ+, ψ2 = 2φ+ + (π/2).

FIG. 5. Contour plot of the spectrum of squeezing of the second atom for Ω/β = 0.3 and ξ2/β = 0.02 as a function of
frequency and detuning. We take ψ2 = 2φ+ + (π/2). The contour lines represent values of the spectrum from -5 to 0.5, in 0.5
increments. Lighter areas correspond to higher values. The spectra are normalized to the outgoing intensity.

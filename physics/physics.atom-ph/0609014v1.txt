Over a period of eight months, we have monitored transition frequencies between nearly degener-
ate, opposite-parity levels in two isotopes of atomic dysprosium (Dy), which are highly sensitive to
temporal variation of the ﬁne-structure constant (α). In this system, the electronic energies of the
opposite-parity levels can be compared utilizing a direct, radio-frequency (rf) electric-dipole transi-
tion between them. Our measurements show that the frequency variation of the 3.1-MHz transition
in 163Dy and the 235-MHz transition in 162Dy are 9.6±6.7 Hz/yr and -0.8±6.6 Hz/yr, respectively.
These results provide an upper limit on the magnitude of fractional variation of α without any
assumptions on the constancy of other fundamental constants at 5.5×10

−1 (1 σ).

Modern theories attempting to unify gravitation with
the other fundamental interactions have renewed interest
in experimental searches for temporal and spatial varia-
tion of fundamental constants. These theories allow for,
or even predict, such variation, which would violate Ein-
stein’s Equivalence Principle [1]. Recently, evidence for
variation of α over cosmological time scales was discov-
ered in quasar absorption spectra [2, 3]. The result in
Ref. [3] corresponds to ˙α/α = (6.40 ± 1.35) × 10−16/yr
assuming a linear shift over 1010 years. However, more
recent quasar absorption measurements present results
with similar reported sensitivity that are consistent with
no variation [4, 5]. On a geological time scale of 109
years, a test for variation of α comes from analyses of
ﬁssion products of a natural reactor in Oklo (Gabon).
However, these analyses are sensitive to the reactor mod-
els used. The discrepancy between earlier analyses [6, 7],
which are consistent with no variation, and the analysis
in Ref. [8], where a variation was reported, has been re-
solved recently through a full monte carlo simulation of
the reactor [9]. This analysis reports a result consistent
with no variation at the level of 1.2 × 10−17/yr.

Observational measurements are diﬃcult to interpret
due to numerous assumptions and uncontrollable system-
atic uncertainties. Laboratory searches (see, for example,
Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13]), which probe variations on the time
scale of years, are easier to interpret since they are re-
peatable, and systematic uncertainties can be studied by
changing experimental conditions. The best laboratory
limit of | ˙α/α| < 1.2 × 10−15/yr (assuming no other con-
stants vary in time, in particular, me/mp [14, 15]) was
obtained from a comparison of a Hg+ optical clock to a
Cs frequency standard [10]. The best limit that is in-
dependent of assumptions regarding other constants was
obtained by combining this result with a comparison of
Yb+ optical clock and a Cs frequency standard [13]. This

measurement gives | ˙α/α| < 2.2 × 10−15/yr.

In this Letter, we report a limit on the temporal varia-
tion of α that is independent of other constants. This re-
sult is based on observing, over a period of eight months,
rf-transitions between nearly degenerate, opposite-parity
levels in atomic dysprosium, as suggested in Ref. [16].
The energy of an atomic level can be expressed as

E = E0 + q(α2/α2

0 − 1),

(1)

where E0 is the present-day energy, α0 is the present-
day value of the ﬁne-structure constant, and q is a level
dependent coeﬃcient that determines the sensitivity to
variations in α [17]. A theoretical calculation has found
that the q values for the two nearly degenerate, opposite-
parity levels in Dy (Fig. 1, levels A and B) are large and
of opposite sign [17]. For the even-parity level (level A),
qA/hc ≃ 6 × 103 cm−1, while for the odd-parity level
(level B), qB/hc ≃ −24 × 103 cm−1. Since explicit un-
certainties are not quoted for these numbers, they are
assumed to be exact in the determination of the ﬁnal
result [18].

Another parametrization of frequency and sensitiv-
ity factor is often used for atomic-clock comparisons, in
which an electronic transition frequency is expressed as

ν = R∞AF (α),

(2)

where R∞ is the Rydberg constant expressed in units
of frequency, A is a dimensionless atomic structure fac-
tor independent of α, and F (α) is a Casimir correction
factor that includes all relativistic eﬀects which depend
on α [19]. In atomic-clock comparisons, the ratio of the
transition frequency of clock 1, ν1, to the transition fre-
quency of clock 2, ν2, can be related to fractional change
in α as

stability of 10−12 for the reference frequency standard.
Such standards are commercially available. In addition,
because the isotope shifts and hyperﬁne splittings are on
the order of the transition frequencies, it is possible to
work with multiple rf transitions, including, in particu-
lar, transitions with energy diﬀerences of opposite sign.
Since the variation in α only depends upon electronic
energy levels [22], the variation of these rf-transitions
should have equal magnitude but opposite sign. This
correlation can be used to detect and eliminate certain
systematics. Currently, we monitor two such transitions:
the 3.1-MHz (F = 10.5 → F = 10.5) transition in 163Dy
and the 235-MHz transition in 162Dy.

The population and detection scheme is shown in
Fig. 1. The long-lived (τB > 200 µs [23]) odd-parity
level B is populated by three transitions. The ﬁrst two
transitions are driven with 833- and 669-nm laser light,
while the third transition involves a spontaneous decay.
Atoms are transferred to the even-parity level A with a
frequency modulated rf electric ﬁeld referenced to a Cs
frequency standard. Level A decays to the ground state
in two steps. Fluorescent light at 564 nm from the second
decay is used for detection.

The atomic beam is described in Ref. [24]. It is pro-
duced by an eﬀusive oven operating at ∼1500 K. In ad-
dition to a multislit nozzle-array attached to the oven,
two external collimators are used to collimate both the
atomic beam and the oven light (in order to minimize the
background due to scattered light from the oven). The
resultant atomic beam has a mean velocity of 500 m/s
and a full-angle divergence of ∼0.2 rad (1/e2-level) in the
transverse directions.

The laser light at 833 and 669 nm is produced by a
Ti:Sapphire ring laser and a ring dye laser with DCM
dye, respectively. Since narrow-band continuous-wave
lasers are ineﬃcient at exciting atomic beams with weak
collimation, an adiabatic passage technique is utilized to
transfer the population to level f (a detailed descrip-
tion of this technique, as well as references to earlier
work, are given in Ref. [25]). Brieﬂy, the beams are di-
verged with cylindrical lenses to match the atomic-beam
divergence. Due to the Doppler eﬀect, the atoms experi-
ence a frequency chirp in laser detuning which transfers
the population to the excited state with high eﬃciency.
The laser light interaction with the atomic beam occurs
within the rf interaction region, which is enclosed by a
magnetic shield. The residual ﬁeld in the interaction re-
gion is ∼1 mG.

The rf-generation and detection system is discussed in
Ref. [26]. The frequency modulated rf ﬁeld is generated
by a synthesizer referenced to a commercial Cs frequency
standard which is compared to a second clock (Rb oscilla-
tor locked to a digital cellular network signal) to monitor
its stability. The short term fractional stability of the
clocks is ∼ 10−11 and approaches 10−12 in 10 minutes of
integration. The modulation frequency is 10 kHz with a

A. Solid lines indicate laser excitation; dashed lines indicate
spontaneous emission; wavy line indicates rf electric ﬁeld.

The expression α[∂ ln(F )/∂α] is the sensitivity of a tran-
sition to variation in α. The coeﬃcients qA and qB for
atomic Dy can be recast into this parametrization by
noting that (for α ≈ α0)

where hν is the energy of level A or B with respect to
the ground state. This gives a sensitivity of 0.6 and −2.4
for level A and B, respectively. These values are, for
example, comparable to the sensitivity of -3.2 for the
transition used in the Hg+ optical clock [20].

A unique aspect of the Dy system is that the observable
quantity is not the ratio νA/νB, but the diﬀerence νB−νA
since an electric-dipole transition can be induced between
the two levels using a rf electric ﬁeld. The time variation
of the transition frequency between levels A and B is

There are several advantages to using the nearly de-
generate levels in Dy. Because most of the transition fre-
quencies are ∼1 GHz or smaller, direct frequency count-
ing techniques can be used. This allows for the com-
parison of two electronic transitions without the need
for optical frequency combs or transfer cavities. A pre-
liminary analysis of statistical and systematic uncertain-
ties shows that the measurement of the transition fre-
quency and the control of the systematics at a mHz level
is feasible, which corresponds to an ultimate sensitivity
of | ˙α/α| ∼ 10−18/yr for two measurements separated by
a year’s time [21]. A mHz resolution of a transition fre-
quency of 1 GHz requires a relatively modest fractional

modulation index of 1. Since the rf-transition linewidth
is ∼20 kHz, this modulation provides a fast sweep across
the line shape in order to minimize the eﬀect of ﬂuctu-
ations such as those due to laser power drifts or den-
sity ﬂuctuations of the atomic beam. The modulation
is provided by the reference output of a lock-in ampli-
ﬁer which demodulates the signal from a photomultiplier
tube used to detect the ﬂuorescence. Respectively, ﬁrst-
and second-harmonic outputs of the lock-in ampliﬁer is
an odd function with zero crossing on resonance and an
even function with a maximum on resonance. In order
to reduce drifts further, the ratio of these two is used to
measure the transition frequency, which is extracted by
a two-step process described in detail in Ref. [26].

There are several imperfections that aﬀect the stability
of our transition frequency measurements. The largest
eﬀect is due to the combination of the residual mag-
netic ﬁeld with the laser-light polarization imperfections.
During normal operation, the polarizations of both laser
light are set to linear, which leads to symmetrically pop-
ulated magnetic sublevels. However, residual light ellip-
ticity leads to orientation of the atoms, which broadens
the line asymmetrically and causes apparent shifts in the
presence of the residual magnetic ﬁeld [21]. In system-
atic studies where we deliberately used circularly polar-
ized light, shifts in the transition frequencies as large as
±160 Hz were observed. The linear polarizations are de-
termined by calcite polarizers with 10−5 extinction ratio
outside the vacuum chamber. However, the light must
travel through optical windows and lenses utilized for
adiabatic passage before reaching the interaction region.
A small amount of stress-induced birefringence on these
lenses was discovered by deliberate misalignment of the
laser beams. The amount of ellipticity depended upon
where the beam sampled a lens. The residual systematic
uncertainties due to this eﬀect range from 2 to 5 Hz on
diﬀerent experimental runs with the smaller uncertainty
corresponding to later runs in which the lens mounts were
modiﬁed to relieve the stress.

In addition to the residual magnetic ﬁeld, the mag-
netic shielding was inadvertently magnetized in the April
2006 runs during systematic studies utilizing external
magnetic-ﬁeld coils. Since the amount of magnetization
and the resultant shifts in the transition frequencies were
unknown at the time, systematic uncertainties have been
assigned by driving the magnetization to saturation and
noting the maximum shift induced for both ﬁeld polar-
ities. The uncertainty due to this eﬀect is 7.5 Hz. The
shields were demagnetized at the beginning of each sub-
sequent run.

Another important systematic is due to the collisions of
Dy atoms with the background gas in the vacuum cham-
ber. Collisional shift rates for the rf transitions due to
various gases were determined in Ref. [26]. The pressure
in the vacuum chamber is ∼ 5 × 10−7 Torr when the Dy
oven is oﬀ. When the oven is turned on, the pressure

3

rises to ∼ 2 × 10−6 Torr, dominated by H2 outgassing
of the oven.
In Ref. [26], the observed shift rates for
H2 were found to be consistent with zero. However, the
pressure of other gases, such as N2, also increases at the
level of ∼ 2 × 10−7 Torr when the oven is turned on,
and continually decreases and stabilize after ∼ 6 hours
of continuous oven operation. The partial pressures are
monitored with a residual gas analyzer (RGA) and the
transition frequencies are corrected for the presence of
N2, O2, H2, and Ar using the shift rates and the RGA
sensitivity factors measured for each gas. The variation
in the pressure of other gases such as H2O and CO2 are
below 10−7 Torr. The total correction is < 2 Hz at any
time during each run. The results also include small cor-
rections (< 0.6 Hz) and uncertainties due to a possible
eﬀect of Dy intra-beam collisions [26].

Finally, there are systematic eﬀects associated with rf
electric-ﬁeld inhomogeneities. The rf electrodes are fed
by twisted-pair wires at one corner. Numerical simula-
tions show that with this feed, at rf wavelengths compa-
rable to the size of the electrodes (∼ 10 cm), spatially
varying amplitude and phase inhomogeneities become
substantial. These inhomogeneities can lead to drifts in
the transition frequency when they are combined with
changes in the atomic beam velocity distribution. This
eﬀect was studied experimentally by deliberate detuning
of the laser frequencies from the optical resonances. This
leads to changes in the transverse velocity distribution of
the beam due to imperfect adiabatic passage. For the two
transitions considered in this study, shifts of < 0.5 Hz for
1 MHz detuning in the laser frequencies were observed.
To keep this eﬀect at the 1 Hz level during the runs,
the laser frequencies were periodically retuned (∼ every
2 minutes) to the center of their respective transitions.
To check for slow variations in the beam velocity distri-
bution due to other changes such as collimator clogging,
this study was repeated several times over a two year pe-
riod, during which the oven was reloaded and collimators
cleaned several times. No signiﬁcant change in the size
or dependence of the eﬀect was observed.

All other systematics considered in Ref. [21] were esti-
mated to be smaller than a Hz for the speciﬁc conditions
of the current experiment. Many of these systematics,
such as AC Stark shifts and oven black-body radiation
shifts, were studied experimentally by exaggerating im-
perfections and were found to be negligible.

We have measured the two rf transition frequencies in
the course of seven runs over eight months. Fig. 2 shows
these measurements corrected for collisional shifts with
the statistical and systematic uncertainties discussed.
Least-squares linear ﬁt to the data points gives slopes
of −0.8 ± 6.6 Hz/yr and 9.6 ± 6.7 Hz/yr for the 235-
MHz and 3.1-MHz transitions, respectively. Accord-
ing to Eq.
(5), these results correspond to ˙α/α =
(−0.5 ± 3.7) × 10−15 yr−1 for the 235-MHz transition
and (−5.3 ± 3.7) × 10−15 yr−1 for the 3.1-MHz tran-

struction which will provide better control over these, as
well as other systematic eﬀects expected to be important
to achieve better than 1-Hz sensitivity. Ultimately, mHz-
level sensitivity may be achievable with this method [21].

sition. As mentioned earlier, because the energy dif-
ferences for these two transitions are of opposite sign,
these two data sets can be combined to construct sum
and diﬀerence frequency plots. The sum frequency
slope, which should be insensitive to a variation in α,
is 8.2 ± 9.4 Hz/yr and consistent with zero. The diﬀer-
ence frequency, which is twice as sensitive to a variation
in α as the individual frequencies, gives the ﬁnal result
˙α/α = (−2.9 ± 2.6) × 10−15 yr−1 corresponding to
of
| ˙α/α| < 5.5 × 10−15 yr−1 with 1 σ conﬁdence.

In conclusion, we have presented the ﬁrst result of a
direct measurement of the temporal variation of α with
atomic dysprosium. This result is within a factor of
2.5 from the present best laboratory result that is in-
dependent of other fundamental constants. However, in
our case the interpretation does not require comparison
with diﬀerent measurements to eliminate dependence on
other constants, and provides an alternative to measure-
ments that utilize state-of-the-art atomic optical clocks.
The present uncertainty is dominated by systematic ef-
fects primarily due to polarization imperfections com-
bined with the residual magnetic ﬁeld, collisional shifts,
and rf electric-ﬁeld inhomogeneities. A signiﬁcant im-
provement is expected from a new apparatus under con-

We present results on the self-energy correction to the energy levels of hydrogen and hydrogenlike
ions. The self energy represents the largest QED correction to relativistic (Dirac-Coulomb) energy
levels. We focus on the perturbation expansion of the self energy of non-S states, and provide
estimates of the Bethe logarithm and of the so-called A60 perturbative coeﬃcient, which can be
considered as a relativistic Bethe logarithm. All non-S atomic states are covered. These results can
be used in high-precision spectroscopy experiments in hydrogen and hydrogenlike ions. They yield
the best available estimate of the self-energy correction of many atomic states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The recent dramatic progress in high-precision spec-
troscopy (see, e.g., [1]) has motivated the calculation of
numerous contributions to the energy levels of hydrogen
and hydrogenlike systems. Such spectroscopic experi-
ments test our understanding of atomic levels, and pro-
vide precise determinations of fundamental constants [2];
this requires accurate predictions of atomic energies, and,
in particular, the calculation of corrections due to Quan-
tum Electrodynamics (QED), the quantum ﬁeld theory of
electromagnetic interactions. In hydrogen and hydrogen-
like ions, the largest correction to the relativistic (Dirac)
energy levels is provided by the so-called self-energy con-
tribution of QED. The self energy is a process which
modiﬁes the relativistic (Dirac) energy of an electron,
and which can be depicted by the following Feynman di-
agram,

,

where the double line denotes the electron (bound to the
nucleus), and where the wavy line represents the photon
emitted and reabsorbed by the electron. The self-energy
correction to energy levels in hydrogen and hydrogenlike
ions can be expressed as an expansion in Zα and ln(Zα)
(see, e.g., [3])—Z is the nuclear charge number of the
nucleus of the hydrogenlike ion under consideration, and
α is the ﬁne-structure constant. Analytic calculations of
the (one-loop) self energy in bound systems have a long
history, starting from Bethe’s seminal paper [4], and have
since extended over more than ﬁve decades.

The purpose of this paper is to provide good approx-
imate values of the self-energy correction to the energy
levels of hydrogen and hydrogenlike ions, for any P state,
and any state with a higher angular momentum. Only
a part of the perturbation expansion of the self energy
of these states it known analytically. The ﬁrst two non-
analytically-known contributions to this expansion are
the Bethe logarithm ln k0(nl) and the so-called A60(nlj)
coeﬃcient of the self energy, which can be characterized

as a relativistic Bethe logarithm [see Sec. II, and in par-
ticular Eqs. (1), (7) and (8)]. Here, nlj is the standard
spectroscopic notation for an atomic state. This paper
thus contains formulas for estimating both of these im-
portant quantities (see Sec. V and VI).

Very precise numerical values of the Bethe logarithm
ln k0(nl) have been obtained (see, e.g., Ref. [5]), and nu-
merical convergence acceleration techniques [6] can in
principle yield very precise values of this quantity for
any atomic state nl [see also Eq. (34) below]. The es-
timate that we provide in Sec. VI should be useful to
experiments that use levels for which no published val-
ues exist (see, e.g., Ref. [7]).

Many new values of the relativistic Bethe loga-
rithm A60(nlj) have recently been published [8]. Other
values have been obtained previously for some S [9, 10,
11] and P states [12, 13]. This paper contains two ad-
ditional values [A60(5F5/2) and A60(5F7/2)], as well as
details on the procedure that we used in obtaining the
values of A60 in Ref. [8] and in Table III (see Sec. IV).

The results of Sec. IV–VI provide an improvement over
the available approximations of the bound-electron self
energy, over a large range of nuclear charge numbers Z.
In particular, they yield the best available estimates for
the self-energy correction in hydrogen, for all the states
for which no exact (non-perturbative) value of the self
energy has yet been published (i.e., all levels, except n =
1 and n = 2 levels [11, 14]).

It is important to know accurately the energy (and in
particular the self energy) of higher angular momentum
states, because they are used in high-precision spectro-
scopic measurements [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. States with
very-high angular orbital quantum numbers l
30 have
been recently used in such experiments [7]. Further moti-
vation for the present study results from the need to accu-
rately compare the two approaches that have been used
for the theoretical study of QED shifts, so as to check
their consistency: (i) the analytic expansion in the pa-
rameter Zα, mostly used for low-Z systems, and (ii) the
numerical approach, which avoids the Zα expansion and
has been used predominantly for the theoretical descrip-
tion of high-Z hydrogenlike ions [21].

≃

Recently, the most accurate methods implementing a
non-perturbative calculation of the self energy [14, 22,
23, 24, 25] have been extended by analytic results [26]
that, taken together, provide access to the self-energy
shift of electrons of total angular momentum j > 3/2.
This has allowed us to obtain numerical values of the self
energy, and to use them in checks of the A60 coeﬃcients
presented in Tables I–IV (see Sec. VII).

Moreover, general progress in theoretical calculations
of atomic energy levels has been achieved by means of nu-
merical algorithms [6, 25, 27] that lead to an accelerated
convergence of the angular momentum series expansion
of the bound-electron relativistic Green function. Such
algorithms are also useful for performing the series sum-
mations that we had to do in order to obtain the values
of A60 presented here (see Sec. IV).

Notation and conventions are deﬁned in Sec. II. The
mathematical method used for the semi-analytic calcula-
tions of A60 in Ref. [8] is discussed in Sec. III. Details
on these calculations are presented in Sec. IV. Formu-
las for the relativistic Bethe logarithm A60(nlj) of S and
P states are presented in Sec. V. Estimates of the Bethe
logarithm ln k0(nl) and of A60(nlj) as a function of the
orbital quantum number l are reported in Sec. VI. We
have performed additional checks of the values of A60 in
Tables I–IV, as described in Sec. VII; we also show in
that section that the inclusion of A60 in the (truncated)
perturbation expansion of the electron self energy does
indeed improve the self energy estimates. A summary of
the paper is given in Sec. VIII. The ﬁtting method that
we used in obtaining asymptotic behaviors of ln k0(nl)
and of A60(nlj) is described in the Appendix.

II. NOTATION AND CONVENTIONS

In this section, we deﬁne the notation and conventions
used in this paper. We write the (real part of the) one-
loop self-energy shift of an electron in the level n with
orbital angular momentum l and total angular momen-
tum j as

∆ESE =

α
π

(Zα)4
n3 F (nlj, Zα) m c2,

(1)

where F (nlj, Zα) is a dimensionless quantity. We use
natural units, in which ¯h = c = m = 1 and e2 = 4πα (m
is the electron mass). It is customary in the literature to
suppress the dependence of F on the quantum numbers
n, j and l and write F (Zα) for F (nlj, Zα).

The quantum numbers l and j can be combined into
the Dirac angular quantum number κ. As a function of
j and l, κ is given by

κ = 2 (l

j) (j + 1/2),

and

and

for

The quantum numbers j and l can be derived from κ

according to

i.e., κ speciﬁes uniquely both j and l. The semi-analytic
expansion of F (nlj, Zα) about Zα = 0 for a general
atomic state with quantum numbers n, l and j gives rise
to the expression [3]

F (nlj, Zα) = A41(nlj) ln[(Zα)

+GSE(nlj, Zα)

.

(5)

(cid:9)

This expansion is semi-analytic, i.e., it involves powers
of Zα and of ln[(Zα)−2]. Terms added to the leading
order in Zα are commonly referred to as the binding
corrections. The A coeﬃcients have two indices, the ﬁrst
of which denotes the power of Zα [including those powers
contained in Eq. (1)], while the second index denotes the
power of the logarithm ln(Zα)−2.

The limit as Zα

0 of GSE(nlj, Zα) is known to be

ﬁnite and is referred to as the A60 coeﬃcient, i.e.,

→

A60(nlj) = lim
Zα→0

GSE(nlj, Zα).

(6)

Historically, the evaluation of the coeﬃcient A60 has been
highly problematic. Due to the large number of terms
that contribute at relative order (Zα)2 and problems con-
cerning the separation of terms that contribute at a spe-
ciﬁc order in the Zα expansion, evaluations are plagued
with severe calculational as well as conceptual diﬃculties.
For example, the evaluation of A60(1S1/2) has drawn a
lot of attention for a long time [3, 10, 28, 29, 30]. And in
general, the complexity of the calculation increases with
increasing principal quantum number.

For particular states, some of the coeﬃcients in (5)
vanish. Notably, this is the case for P states and for
states with higher angular momenta, as a consequence
of their behavior at the origin, which is less singular
than that of S states (speciﬁcally, we have A62(nlj) =
A50(nlj) = A41(nlj) = 0 for l
= 0—see Refs. [3, 28] and
references therein). The fact that the logarithmic coef-
ﬁcient A71(nlj) vanishes for l
= 0 has been pointed out
in [31]. For nonzero l, we thus have
F (nlj, Zα) = A40(nlj) + (Zα)2

III. THE ǫ METHOD

In this section, we illustrate the usefulness of the so-
called ǫ method [10, 12, 13] in bound-state calculations.
It is known that higher-order terms in the expansion of
the bound-electron propagator in powers of Coulomb ver-
tices and relativistic corrections to the wavefunction gen-
erate terms of higher order in Zα (see, e.g., Ref. [42] and
references therein); these terms manifest themselves in
Eq. (5) in the form of the function GSE(nlj, Zα), which
summarizes these eﬀects at the order of α (Zα)6 m.
It
is also well known that for very soft virtual photons, the
potential expansion fails and generates an infrared diver-
gence, which is cut oﬀ by the atomic momentum scale,
Zα (see, e.g., Ref. [42] and references therein). This cut-
oﬀ for the infrared divergence is one of the mechanisms
that lead to the logarithmic terms in Eq. (5).

The ǫ method is used for the separation of the two
diﬀerent energy scales for virtual photons: the nonrel-
ativistic domain, in which the virtual photon assumes
values of the order of the atomic binding energy, and the
relativistic domain, in which the virtual photon assumes
values of the order of the electron rest mass. We con-
sider here a model problem with one “virtual photon,”
that involves the separation of the function being inte-
grated into a high- and a low-energy contribution. This
necessitates the temporary introduction of a parameter ǫ;
the dependence on ǫ will cancel at the end of calculation
[see Eq. (22) below] when the high- and the low-energy
parts are added together. We have,

p2/(2m)
(Zα)/r, and En is the Schr¨odinger bound-
(Zα)2 m/(2 n2). The Bethe logarithm
state energy
is spin-independent and therefore independent of the
total angular momentum j for a given orbital angu-
lar momentum l;
it can be written as a function of
n and l alone. For the atomic levels under investiga-
tion, the Bethe logarithm has been evaluated in [33]
and [5, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] (the results exhibit vary-
ing accuracies). Because A60 involves relativistic correc-
tions to the coeﬃcient A40, which in turn is given mainly
by the Bethe logarithm, it is natural to refer to A60 as a
“relativistic Bethe logarithm.”

A general analytic result for the logarithmic correction
A61 as a function of the bound state quantum numbers
n, l and j can be inferred from Eq. (4.4a) of [3, 28] upon
subtraction of the vacuum polarization contribution con-
tained in the quoted equation. We have (Ψ denotes the
logarithmic derivative of the Γ function [41,

When the high-energy part (18) and the low-energy

cel, as it should, and we have

sion with the leading-order terms of the Zα expansion
of the function F (nlj, Zα) given in Eq. (7) for l
= 0
(terms associated to the coeﬃcients A40, A61, and A60).
In an actual Lamb shift calculation, the simpliﬁcations
observed between terms containing ǫ are crucial [12, 13].
In this model example, the epsilon method allowed us
to obtain (22) with minimal eﬀort. For comparison, the
reader may consider App. A of [43], which illustrates the
cancellation of ǫ in higher orders of the Zα expansion,
using a diﬀerent example.

deﬁnition (13).

p

Within the ǫ method, we start by dividing the calcu-
lation of J(Zα) into a high-energy part JH(Zα, ǫ) and a
low-energy part JL(Zα, ǫ), each of which depends on an
additional parameter ǫ [that satisﬁes (12)]. The sum of
the high- and low-energy contributions, which is

J(Zα) = JH(Zα, ǫ) + JL(Zα, ǫ),

(15)

does not depend on ǫ. Therefore, the dependence on ǫ
should vanish entirely when we add the high- and low-
energy contributions. We may therefore expand both
contributions JH and JL ﬁrst in Zα, then in ǫ, and then
add them up at the end of the calculation in order to
obtain the semi-analytic expansion of J(Zα) in powers
of Zα and ln(Zα).

Let us ﬁrst discuss the “high-energy part” of the cal-

culation. It is given by the expression

This section, along with the previous one, gives detail
on the methods we used in order to obtain the values
of the A60 coeﬃcient in Tables I–IV (see also Ref. [8]).
The purpose of our calculations is to provide data for
the self-energy coeﬃcients up to and including the rela-
tive order (Zα)2 [see Eq. (7)]; for the states of interest
here (non-S states) this corresponds to the coeﬃcients
A40, A61 and A60. Equation (8) is the well-known gen-
eral formula for the coeﬃcient A40. The coeﬃcient A61

6
can be found in Eq. (10), with special cases treated in
Eqs. (11a)–(11c). The remaining nonlogarithmic term
A60 is by far the most diﬃcult to evaluate, and the ﬁrst
results for any with orbital angular momentum quantum
number l
2 were recently obtained in Ref. [8] by using
the methods described in this section.

≥

As explained in detail in [10, 12, 13], the calculation of
the one-loop self energy falls naturally into a high- and a
low-energy part (FH and FL, respectively). In Sec. III,
we illustrated this procedure, and the introduction of
the scale-separation parameter ǫ for the photon energy.
According to [12, Eqs. (39)–(43)], the contributions to
the low-energy part can be separated naturally into the
nonrelativistic dipole and the nonrelativistic quadrupole
part, and into relativistic corrections to the current, to
the Hamiltonian, to the binding energy and to the wave-
function of the bound state. We follow here the approach
outlined in Refs. [12, 13], with some modiﬁcations.

One main diﬀerence as compared to the evaluation
scheme described previously concerns the nonrelativis-
tic quadrupole (nq) part. It is given by a speciﬁc matrix
element (see the deﬁnition of Pnq in Ref. [12, Eq. (39)]),
which has to be evaluated on the atomic state and aver-
aged over the angles of the photon wave vectors:

Our improved results for A60 coeﬃcients rely essen-
tially on a more general code for the analytic calcula-
tions, written in the computer-algebra package Mathe-
matica [47, 48], which enables the corrections to be eval-
uated semi-automatically. Intermediate expressions with
some 200,000 terms are encountered, and the complexity
of the calculations sharply increases with the principal
quantum number n, and, as far as the complexity of the
angular momentum algebra is concerned, with the orbital
angular quantum number of the bound electron.

Of crucial importance was the development of conver-
gence acceleration methods which were used extensively
for the evaluation of remaining one-dimensional integrals
which could not be done analytically. These integrals are
analogous to expressions encountered in previous work
(see [12, Eqs. (36), (47) and (48)] and [13, Eqs. (80)–
(84)]). The numerically evaluated contributions involve
slowly convergent hypergeometric series, and—in more
extreme cases—inﬁnite series over partial derivatives of
hypergeometric functions, and generalizations of Lerch’s
Φ transcendent [49, 50]. As a result of the summation
over l′ in (25), after performing radial integrals, two spe-
ciﬁc hypergeometric functions enter naturally into the ex-
pressions for the bound-state matrix elements that char-
acterize the one-loop correction (see, e.g., [13, Eqs (80)
and (81)]. One of these functions is given by

for the low and high-energy parts of the self energy, for
the states with n = 5 under investigation [see Eqs. (27)
and (28) and Table V]. These may be helpful in an in-
dependent veriﬁcation of our calculations. Note that the
G7/2 and G9/2 states involve the most problematic an-
gular momentum algebra of all atomic states considered
here.

For some P states (see Table I), the values of A60 re-
ported here are four orders of magnitude more accurate
than previous results [12, 13], due to the improved nu-
merical algorithms. For the 3P1/2 states, the numerical
value for the A60 coeﬃcients of Table I diﬀers from the
previously reported result [13] by more than the numer-
ical uncertainty quoted in Ref. [13], whereas they are in
agreement with previous results [12, 13] in the case of
2P1/2 and 4P1/2 states. The discrepancy for A60(3P1/2)

TABLE VI: As explained in Refs. [12, 13], the low-energy con-
tributions to A60 naturally separate into the following terms:
the nonrelativistic quadrupole part Fnq [12, Eq. (39)], the
relativistic corrections to the current Fδy [12, Eq. (40)], rel-
ativistic corrections to the Hamiltonian FδH [12, Eq. (41)],
and relativistic corrections to the bound-state energy FδE [12,
Eq. (42)] and to the wavefunction Fδφ [12, Eq. (43)]. This
classiﬁcation suggests that it is natural to refer to the low-
energy contribution L as a relativistic Bethe logarithm. Ob-
serve that the total contribution to A60 of the low-energy part,
which reads 0.001 834 827(1), is roughly ﬁve times smaller
than the largest individual contribution (from FδH), due to
mutual cancellations.

tions (30) and (32), which could not be evaluated analyt-
ically. The numerical diﬃculties encountered in previous
calculations due to slow convergence of the integrals are
essentially removed by the convergence acceleration tech-
niques.

For some states, rather severe numerical cancellations
are observed between the high- and low-energy contribu-
tions to the self energy as well as between the diﬀerent
contributions to the low-energy part. This intriguing ob-
servation is documented in Tables VI and VII, using the
5G7/2 state as an example. Note that these numerical
cancellations go beyond the required exact, analytic can-
cellation of the divergent contributions which depend on
the scale-separation parameter ǫ.

V. A60 FOR HIGHER-n STATES

This section contains approximate formulas that we
have found for the A60 coeﬃcients of P and D states,
for principal quantum numbers n that go beyond those
of Tables I and II. These tables contain enough values
of A60(nlj) for extrapolations to be made. We present

contains the ﬁrst coeﬃcients of such an expansion, as deﬁned
in Eq. (35). The approximate values of A60(nlj ) that can be
directly deduced from this table and from Eq. (35b) are the
best available values of A60 for P and D states, except for the
states that are represented in Tables I and II. These results
are depicted in Fig. 1.

yield approximate values of A60 which are valid for any
principal quantum number n (for P and D states).

VI. APPROXIMATIONS OF A60 AND OF THE

In addition to studying the dependence of A60(nlj)

it is interesting to analyze the behavior of A60(nlj) as a

We have also studied the asymptotic behavior of the
Bethe logarithm ln k0(¯nl), because this is a quantity sim-
ilar to the “relativistic Bethe logarithm” A60, and be-
cause it yields a large contribution to the self energy [see
Eqs. (7) and (8)]. We show in this section that the Bethe
logarithm ln[k0(¯nl)/R∞], where ¯n = l + 1, appears to
behave asymptotically as 1/l3 (R∞ denotes the Rydberg
constant). This result diﬀers from the 1/l7/2 asymptotic
behavior of ln[k0(¯nl)/R∞] deduced from Eq. (B5) in [52,
p. 845]. Extrapolations of the Bethe logarithm ln k0(nl)
as a function of n were used in Ref. [53] for S, P and D
states (l = 0 to 2).

We also postulate that the Bethe logarithm ln k0(¯nl),
where ¯n = l + 1, can be expanded in powers of 1/l
. In order to ﬁnd the ﬁrst ﬁve coeﬃcients
about l =
of such an expansion, we used the ﬁtting procedure de-
scribed in the Appendix. The resulting approximation
reads:

where ¯n = l + 1, and where the neglected contribution
is of order 1/l5. This approximation should be valid
for l
; nevertheless, it yields values of the Bethe
logarithm that are both precise (see Fig. 2) and compat-
ible with all the values of ln[k0(¯nl)/R∞] for l = 3, . . . , 19
20 levels of hydro-
(taken from Ref. [5]). For the l
gen, the uncertainty in the result of approximation (37)
is negligible, when compared to the best experimental
uncertainty in frequency measurements (about 1 Hz [1]).
Moreover, we suggest that the orders of magnitude of
the self-energy coeﬃcient A60(nlj) and of the Bethe log-
arithm ln k0(nl) do not depend on the principal quan-
tum number n,
i.e., the order of magnitude of a co-
eﬃcient A60(nlj) is given by the order of magnitude

FIG. 1: These graphs show exact and approximate values of the self-energy coeﬃcient A60—see Eq. (7). Exact values are
represented by dots and can be found in Tables I and II. The two curves of each graph represent the upper and lower limits of
the approximation to A60 provided by A3 in Eqs. (35), by taking into account the uncertainties on the coeﬃcients of Table VIII.
For levels in hydrogen with principal quantum number n ≥ 10, the uncertainty in A60 deduced from these curves contribute to
the uncertainty in the electron self energy (1) by less than 2 Hz.

could thus be used for estimating the order of magnitude
of the self energy (1)—with the help of Eqs. (7), (8), (11).
Estimating the self energy correction (1) can be useful in
high-precision spectroscopy experiments with large-l lev-
els. Thus, for instance, a recent experiment [7] required
evaluating the self energies of circular (n = l+1) states of
orbital quantum number l
30. On the theoretical side,
≃
future calculations of A60(nlj) and ln[k0(nl)/R∞] can be
checked against the asymptotic behaviors of A60(¯nlj) and
ln[k0(¯nl)/R∞] that are described above.

−

The order of magnitude of A60(nlj) as a function of the
orbital quantum number l (with either j = l + 1/2 or j =
l
1/2) is most naturally represented by the magnitude
of either limn→∞ A60(nlj) or A60(¯nlj), where ¯n = l + 1
is the smallest n possible for a given l. We chose the
latter possibility for two reasons. First, small-n values of
A60(nlj) are available (see Tables I–IV). Second, future
values of A60(nlj) for higher angular quantum numbers l
are likely to be obtained ﬁrst for states where n = l +
1, which is the smallest n possible for a given angular
momentum quantum number l. In particular, such states
have simpler radial wavefunctions (the number of terms
in the radial wavefunction of a state increases with n
l).
And ﬁnally, circular states (n = l+1) are relevant to high-
precision spectroscopy experiments (see, e.g., Ref. [7]),
whereas n =

states are unphysical.

−

As mentioned above, we expect an asymptotic behav-
ior of the form 1/lk, with k integer, for A60(¯nlj) and for
the Bethe logarithm ln[k0(¯nl)/R∞]. Such a functional
form is motivated by the fact that all the Aik(nlj) coeﬃ-

logarithm). For A60, this behavior is a generalization
of what is observed for P, D, F and G states in Tables
I–IV. For the Bethe logarithm, the fact that ln k0(nl)
and ln k0(¯nl) have the same order of magnitude can be
20 by inspecting the
observed for states with l < n
results of Ref. [5].

Eq. (8)]. (We suppose that A60 and A40 can also be ex-
panded in such a series.) This can for instance be checked
with the formulas for Aik(nlj) reviewed in Ref. [2, p. 468],
with the help of Eq. (10) for A61(nlj), where Ψ(n + 1)

In the Taylor expansion (in Zα) of this energy, the
asymptotic behavior of the coeﬃcient of (Zα)2k is given
by 1/l2k (this conclusion also holds for circular state ¯nlj
1/2). Thus, for circular states, successive
with j = l
relativistic corrections to the nonrelativistic energy of a
bound electron fall oﬀ faster and faster with the orbital
quantum number l, with two additional powers of 1/l for
each order in (Zα)2. If this rule applies to the coeﬃcients
of the self-energy expansion (7), the asymptotic form of
should be 1/l4; in fact, the lower-order
A60(¯nlj) as l
coeﬃcient A40(¯nlj) decreases as 1/l2, as can be seen in
Eq. (8). On the other hand, since A60(nlj) can be consid-
ered as a relativistic correction to the Bethe logarithm,
applying the above rule yields an asymptotic form in 1/l5
for A60(¯nlj), since the Bethe logarithm behaves as 1/l3,
as described in this section. These observations are fully
compatible with the graphs of Figs. 4 and 5, from which
the asymptotic form (36) of A60(¯nlj) was deduced (with
an exponent k probably equal to 4 or 5).

VII. CHECKS OF THE A60 COEFFICIENTS

We have checked our analytic results for A60 (cf.
Tables I–IV) by an independent method:
the ana-
lytic results were compared to values deduced from
non-perturbative, numerical calculations of the self en-
ergy (1). We have used the numerical self-energy values
of Refs. [14, 22, 26, 54, 55, 56], as well as new values [57],
which extend the results of Ref. [26] to smaller nuclear
charge numbers Z (to Z between 10 and 25). In most
cases, the checks that we detail below conﬁrm the values
of A60 reported in Tables I–IV, to a relative precision of
about 15 %. The few exceptions are the following. For
2P states, the numerical values of the self-energy conﬁrm
the results of Table I to about 1 %. For nD3/2 states
with n = 3, . . . , 8, the non-perturbative self-energy re-
sults yield A60(nD3/2) = 0.005(10), in agreement with
the results of Table II. And ﬁnally, we did not check
A60(8D5/2) in Table II by using non-perturbative self-
energy values because no such values are available for the
8D5/2 state. However, as depicted in Fig. 1, the value of

FIG. 6: This graph shows values of the self-energy coeﬃ-
cients A60(¯nlj), where ¯n = l + 1, as a function of the Dirac
quantum number κ, where κ is deﬁned in (2). The large value
A60(1S1/2) ≃ −31 is not represented here. This plot shows
that for S and P states (κ = −2, −1 and 1), the A60 coeﬃcient
exhibits an exceptional behavior; such an exceptional behav-
ior is also found in the self-energy coeﬃcient A61 in Eq. (10),
which is known analytically.

−

the procedure depicted in Fig. 3 was applied to the self-
energy coeﬃcient A60(¯nlj); we obtained the asymptotic
behavior presented at the beginning of this section, and
in particular in Eq. (36). The graphs supporting (36)
are given in Fig. 4 for with states with j = l + 1/2, and
in Fig. 5 for states with j = l
1/2. Each of these
graphs uses only three values of A60 (D, F and G states);
even though this is a relatively small number of values
compared to the number of available values of the Bethe
logarithm, the behavior of the ﬁrst few data points in
Fig. 3 justiﬁes using only a few small-l values in order to

predict the asymptotic behavior of A60(¯nlj) for l

The values of the A60 coeﬃcient of S and P states
where not used in obtaining Eq. (36), because it is con-
venient to treat the orders of magnitude of the A60 coef-
fcient of these states separately from the orders of mag-
nitude of higher-l states; Fig. 6 illustrates this point.
We note that the self-energy coeﬃcient A61 also exhibits
an exceptional behavior for S and P states (see, e.g.,
Eq. (4.4a) in [3]). As a additional consequence, estimat-
ing the coeﬃcient c of the asymptotic form of A60 in
Eq. (36) would require use of states with orbital angular
momentum quantum number l

2 (D, F, etc.).

≥

The possible values of the exponent k in Eq. (36) de-
duced from both the graphs of Fig. 4 and of Fig. 5 are
compatible with each other (k
3 with, probably, k = 4
or k = 5). It is indeed expected that the asymptotic form
of A60(¯nlj) be the same for j = l + 1/2 and j = l
1/2,
as can be seen from the numerical values for D, F and G
states found in Tables II–IV. More precise estimates of
the asymptotic exponent k in Eq. (36) can be obtained
through the procedure we used in Figs. 4 and 5, as soon
as additional values of A60(¯nlj), with ¯n = l + 1 are avail-
able.

−

According to the results of this section, the “relativistic
Bethe logarithm” A60(¯nlj) decreases at least as fast (and
probably one or two powers faster), as a function of l,
than the Bethe logarithm ln k0(¯nl). Such a behavior is
also found in the (Dirac-Coulomb) energy of hydrogen

FIG. 7: Figure (a) shows exact and approximate values of
the (scaled) self energy F of a 2P1/2 electron [see Eq. (1)].
Exact values are given on the solid line. The two-coeﬃcient
approximation (41) is represented by long dashes. The three-
coeﬃcient approximation (42) uses the value of A60(2P1/2)
that we provide in Table I, and is indicated by short dashes.
Figure (b) displays the improvement provided by the inclu-
sion of A60 in the self-energy approximation, as measured by
the function I in Eq. (43); negative values of I indicate that
including A60 improves the approximation.

FIG. 8: These two ﬁgures represent respectively the same
quantities as those found in Fig. 7, but for the 5G7/2 level
instead of the 2P1/2 level. The fact that curve (b) contains
negative values of I [see Eq. (43)] indicates that the three-
order approximation (42) to the self energy (7) is better than
the two-order approximation (41), at least over the range of
nuclear charge numbers Z = 25–110. The three-order ap-
proximation (42) uses the value of A60(5G7/2) reported in
Table IV.

A60(8D5/2) reported here appears to ﬁt well within the
series of A60(nD5/2) values for n = 3, . . . , 7 (see Table II).
The ﬁrst check that we applied consisted of comparing
the numerical, exact results for F to two of its successive
approximations. The ﬁrst approximation, F (2)(Zα), in-
cludes the two dominant and already-known coeﬃcients
A40 (8) and A61 (10) of expansion (7):

F (2)(Zα) = A40 + (Zα)2A61 ln(Zα)

−2,

(41)

and the second approximation, F (3), includes in addition
the next-order contribution reported in this paper:

F (3)(Zα) = A40 + (Zα)2

A61 ln(Zα)

.

(cid:2)
For a given electronic level nlj, one expects that
for low Z,
the curve of the higher-order approxi-
mation F (3)(Zα) be closer to the curve of F (Zα)
than F (2)(Zα).
In order to check this, we plotted the
quantity

which should go to
0, as can be seen from
as Z
Eq. (7). In (43), the purpose of the logarithm is only to
obtain more legible graphs; a value of I lower than zero
indicates that including A60 in the approximation of F
improves the lower-order approximation. For the states
of Tables I–IV, graphs of (43) are compatible with their
expected behavior [I(Zα) is negative for Z suﬃciently
close to zero, and is consistent with a
limit]. Fig-
ures 7 and 8 show this behavior for two electronic states.
Moreover, the improvement provided by the inclusion
of A60 in the approximation for F becomes greater as
the total angular momentum j increases:
for given n
and Z, the improvement function (43) decreases as j in-
creases; this behavior is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Similar-
ily, the range of Z for which approximation F (3) is better
than F (2) increases with increasing j. In the worst of the
cases considered here (j = 1/2), approximation F (3) is
better than F (2) up to Z
25. As shown in Fig. 8, for a
high-j level such as 5G7/2, the higher-order approxima-
tion F (3) is better than F (2) even up to Z = 110.

The second check consisted in estimating A60 from
the numerical values of the self energy (1). For all the
electronic levels nlj studied here, we have plotted the

FIG. 9: Plot (solid line) of numerical values of the remain-
der GSE(4D5/2, Zα) of the self energy (5); the dashed line
indicates the value of A60(4D5/2) reported in this paper (see
Table II). By deﬁnition, the coeﬃcient A60 can be obtained
as the limit (6) of GSE as Zα → 0. This plot shows that the
value of A60 extracted from numerical self-energies is consis-
tent with the value obtained by the calculations presented in
this paper. We made identical observations for all the states
of Tables I–IV.

and 5F5/2 states. The limit of this function as Z → 0 must be
zero if the coeﬃcients A60 of Tables I–IV agree with exact, nu-
merical values of the self energy. The curve displayed here in-
dicates that the two values of ∆fsA60(5F ) in Eq. (46) obtained
independently from Table III and from non-perturbative self
energies (1) [via Eqs. (7), (8), (11c), (44) and (45)] do not

function GSE(nlj, Zα) of (5); this is made possible by
the fact that all the coeﬃcients of (5) are known for
all states [3, 28], except for A60, which has been eval-
uated for a few states that include the ones we con-
sider here [5, 39, 40]. As indicated in (6), the limit
of the remainder GSE(nlj, Zα) as Zα
0 is by deﬁni-
tion A60(nlj). We have estimated this limit both visually
and by ﬁtting GSE(nlj, Zα) with various choices of non-
zero higher-order terms. A typical curve for GSE(Zα) is
shown in Fig. 9. The estimates of A60 obtained by these
procedures conﬁrm the independent analytic results of
Tables I–IV to a typical accuracy of 10–20 %, with a few
exceptions. Thus, for 2P levels, plotting GSE as in Fig. 9
allowed us to conﬁrm the values of A60(2Pj) in Table I to
a precision of about 1 %. This exception comes from that
fact that the self energy of 2P states is known to high pre-
cision [14] for values of Zα close to zero (Z = 1, . . . , 5):
such values are well-suited to an evaluation of A60 by
the limit (6). Plotting GSE for D3/2 states leads to
A60(nD3/2) = 0.005(10) for n = 3, . . . , 8, in agreement
with Table II. Finally, since no non-perturbative self-
energy (1) is available for 8D5/2 states, we were not able
to independently obtain A60(8D5/2) by using such values.
As a by-product of our work with graphs of
GSE(nlj, Zα), we estimate the self-energy remainder
GSE(nlj, α) relevant to hydrogen (Z = 1) to be 0.030(5)
for 3D5/2 and 4D5/2 states [see Eq. (5)]; this is larger than
the estimate of 0.00(1) given in Ref. [2, p. 468]. These two
new values change the previous estimate of the self energy
of 3D5/2 and 4D5/2 states through Eq. (7) by a relatively
large amount, compared to the current best experimen-
tal uncertainty in transition frequencies (about 1 Hz [1]).
Thus, a variation of 0.03 in GSE(3D5/2, α) in (5) corre-
sponds to a variation of about 50 Hz in the self energy
correction (1) of the 3D5/2 level in hydrogen. The same
variation in GSE(4D5/2, α) induces a variation of about
20 Hz in the self energy of the 4D5/2 level in hydrogen; on
the other hand, this latter change is small compared to

the uncertainty of the relevant measurements considered
in Ref. [2].

As a third and last check, we used the numerical, ex-
act values of F in order to study the following diﬀerence
between remainders GSE [see Eqs. (5) and (7)]:

∆fsGSE(nl, Zα) = GSE(nll+1/2, Zα)

which denotes a quantity associated to the ﬁne-structure.
The numerical evaluation of this limit is interesting: for
the states of Tables I–IV, the numerical results for F
yield values of ∆fsA60(nl) that are more accurate than
our numerical estimates of the two individual terms
A60(nll+1/2) and A60(nll−1/2). Our analytic values for
∆fsA60 in Eq. (46) were checked by plotting

K(Z) =

where ∆fsGSE(nl, Zα) was calculated from the numerical
values of F [see Eq. (7) and the coeﬃcients reproduced
in Sec. II], and where the value of ∆fsA60(nl) in Eq. (46)
was deduced from the analytic results of Tables I–IV.
If the numerical and analytic estimates of ∆fsA60(nl) do
agree, the function (47) goes to zero as Z
0. This is in-
deed consistent with what we observed; ﬁgure 10 provides
an example of this behavior. We conﬁrm the values of
∆fsA60(nl) in Eq. (46) that can be immediately deduced
from Tables I–IV. The analytic results for ∆fsA60(nl)
are thus found to be consistent with the numerical data
∆fsGSE; the level of conﬁrmation is 5–10 % [relative to
∆fsA60(nl)] for P and D states (1 % for the 2P states, and

→

14

8D states not included for the reason mentioned above),
3 % for F states, and 1% for G states.

This represents an improvement over the accuracy
of A60(nlj) obtained by the previous check. This im-
provement comes evidently from the fact that the relative
deviation of ∆fsGSE in Eq. (44) from ∆fsA60 in Eq. (46)
110, compared to
is small over the whole range 0 < Z
the relative deviation

contributions goes to zero. We have observed that, as re-
quired, these divergences cancel when the two parts are
added. Moreover, our calculations correctly reproduced
the known lower-order coeﬃcients A40 and A61. We have
also checked our results for A60 against numerical values
of the self energy, and were able to conﬁrm them by this
independent method to the level of about 15 % (except
for D3/2 states, as explained in Sect. VII).

of GSE [see Eq. (5)] from A60(nlj) in Eq. (6)—with
j = l + 1/2 or j = l

certainty of the numerical evaluation of the limit of (47)
0 is relatively small. Figure 10 shows an exam-
as Z
ple of the smallness of the contributions to ∆fsGSE that
go beyond ∆fsA60. Moreover, we have observed that the
higher the angular momentum l, the smaller the values of
the deviation (47), hence the stronger conﬁrmation of our
values of ∆fsA60(nl) for high orbital angular momenta.
This point is also illustrated in Fig. 10.

VIII. SUMMARY OF RESULTS

This paper contains results that are relevant to the
self energy of a non-S electron bound to a point nucleus
of charge number Z. We provided estimates and values
(see also Ref. [8]) for the ﬁrst two non-analytically-known
contributions to the self-energy expansion (5), namely
the Bethe logarithm ln k0(nl) and the so-called A60(nlj)
coeﬃcient, which can be viewed as a relativistic Bethe
logarithm. The main numerical results are contained
in Tables I–IV, in Eq. (35) and Table VIII, in Eq. (36)
and in Eq. (37). We have also conjectured, in Sec. VI,
that the relativistic Bethe logarithm A60(nlj) does not
strongly depend on the principal quantum number n. In
addition to this, we note that the orders of magnitude
of A60(n ll−1/2) and A60(n (l + 1)l+3/2) are the same, in
Tables I–IV. All these results yield in particular, through
Eqs. (1) and (7), the best available approximations of the
self energy in hydrogen and light hydrogenlike ions, ex-
cept for n = 1 and n = 2 levels [11, 14] (see also Sec. VII);
such an approximation can be obtained through Eqs. (1)
and (7).

Calculating A60 has been a challenge since the seminal
work of Bethe [4] on the dominant self-energy coeﬃcients
of S states [see Eqs. (7) and (1)]. Details of the method
we used were described in Sec. III and IV. As discussed
in Sec. VII, including the coeﬃcients A60 reported in
Tables I–IV in a (truncated) expansion of the self energy
improves its accuracy over a large range of nuclear charge
numbers Z.

We checked our calculations of A60 by both analytic
and numerical means. The so-called ǫ method, which
we have employed (see Sec. III), makes divergences ap-
pear in the low- and high-energy contributions to A60,
as the scale-separating parameter ǫ between these two

Obtaining results for A60 required extending (analyti-
cally) the angular algebra developed for 2P states [12] to
higher angular momenta. Techniques of numerical con-
vergence acceleration of series [6, 25, 27] were instru-
mental in evaluating the parts of A60 that could not be
analytically calculated. The recent analytic calculations
of Ref. [26] enabled us to obtain with a high precision
the self energy (1) of electrons with high (j > 3/2) angu-
lar momentum, for various values of the nuclear charge
number Z; the new calculations that we have performed
required the use of massively parallel computers, and
thousands of hours of computing time.
(These numer-
ical data, which have been used for the plots in Figs.
8–10, will be presented in detail elsewhere [57].) We
have also collected the most recent available values of the
self energy. This provided us with independent values of
the A60 coeﬃcients, extracted from the numerical self-
energies, thus allowing us to check the analytic results
presented in Tables I–IV (see Sec. VII).

Severe cancellations appeared, between diﬀerent con-
tributions to A60 (in addition to the cancellation of the
ǫ-parameter divergences): for some of the atomic states
investigated, the absolute magnitude of the A60 coeﬃ-
cients is as small as 10−3, whereas the largest individual
contribution to A60, when following the classiﬁcation of
the corrections according to Refs. [12, 13], is of the order
of 10−2 or larger for all atomic states discussed here (see
also Tables VI and VII).

the
ln[k0(nl)/R∞] and of

the estimates given by Eqs. (35), (36) and (37), and
Table VIII. The results presented in this paper also
allow one to perform checks of future exact self-energies
obtained by numerical methods, by comparing their
values to the three-term self-energy approximation (42)
provided here for P and higher-l states. The values
of A60 in Tables I–IV can be of interest for analyzing
the Lamb shift of highly-excited (high-n and high-l)
electronic states in recent [7, 15, 16, 17] and future
high-precision spectroscopy experiments. The results of
Sect. IV–VI also provide the best available self-energy
approximation for many states nlj and nuclear charge
numbers Z (see Sec. VII); these approximations can for
instance be useful in evaluating the contribution of QED
eﬀects in atoms [58, 59, 60, 61] or molecules [62].

APPENDIX: LOCAL FITS

This appendix describes a ﬁtting procedure which is
designed to extract “local ” numerical quantities from a
set of data points, and to allow one to assess the numer-
ical uncertainty associated to these quantities. A partial
sketch of this procedure was ﬁrst introduced in Ref. [63].
Here, “local” refer for instance to the evaluation of a per-
turbation expansion about one abscissa; the purpose of
the method presented here is to perform ﬁts that are lo-
cal to an abscissa of interest, as opposed to ﬁnding the
best global ﬁt of some data points. We thus used it in
order to obtain asymptotic coeﬃcients for A60(nlj) for P
and D states in Sec. V (see Table VIII), as well as the
asymptotic expansion of the Bethe logarithm ln k0(nl) in
Eq. (37)—in these applications, the quantities evaluated
are local to either n =
. This method can in
or l =
principle be applied to many other problems that require
local ﬁts.

for (49), we ﬁt (exactly) each pair of two consecutive
points (50) in Fig. 2 with a line [64], as depicted in
Fig. 11. Each of the ﬁtting lines in Fig. 11 gives an
estimate of limit (49) by extrapolation to 1/l = 0 (in-
tersection of the line with the 1/l = 0 axis). Figure 12
contains each of these estimates, as a function of the aver-
age abscissa of the two points that were used in obtaining

FIG. 11: This ﬁgure shows the lines going through a few pairs
of successive data points (50)—see also Fig. 2. Each of these
lines is a local approximation to the curve underlying the data
points. Each line yields an estimate of the limit (49) of the
data points as 1/l → 0 (this estimate is at the intersection of
the line with the 1/l = 0 axis). Fig. 12 graphically displays
these estimates.

FIG. 12: This ﬁgure shows the estimates of limit (49) ob-
tained through the two-point ﬁts of Fig. 11. From this graph,
we limit (49) to be −0.0568(1), which is more precise than,
and coherent with the value −0.057(1) obtained from the orig-
inal data points (50) in Figs. 2 and 11. The limit estimates
are plotted along the vertical direction, while the abscissa as-
sociated to an estimate is the average abscissa of the two data
points of Fig. 11 that were used in producing it.

This better estimate

it. Because the curve in Fig. 12 is relatively ﬂatter than
the curve in Fig. 11, we can estimate limit (49) with an
improved uncertainty; thus, we deduce from Fig. 12 the
0.0568(1) for the limit (49) that we are studying,
value
0.057(1).
which is coherent with the previous estimate
0.0568(1) of limit (49) can be
improved by continuing to increase the number p of data
points (50) included in local ﬁts of the data. Thus, for
an increasing number p of data points, we ﬁtted (ex-
actly) each set of p successive points (50) in Fig. 11 with
a polynomial of degree p
1 (linear combination of the
functions 1, 1/l,. . . , 1/lp−1), and represented the value
of the polynomial extrapolated to 1/l = 0 as a func-
tion of the average abscissa of the p points. Fig. 13
depicts this process. The plotted values are estimates
of the limit (49) obtained with higher and higher-order
(local) ﬁts of the data points (50). We observed that
the curves so obtained become exponentially ﬂat, in the
sense that their relative amplitude become exponentially
smaller and smaller—until the uncertainties of individual
estimates become important, as described below. This
fact, which is illustrated in Fig. (13), allowed us to ob-

−

is
0.056853(2) [see Eq. (37)], as is illustrated in Fig. 14.
This limit was obtained by ﬁtting each sequence of p = 6
data points with a ﬁfth-degree polynomial. Fits of the
data points (50) with larger numbers of data points dis-
play more irregular estimate curves; this can for instance
be seen by comparing Fig. 14 with Fig. 15.

As we have seen above, the uncertainty of the ﬁtted
value can be evaluated by visually prolongating the ﬁt-
ting curves (i.e., curves such as those of Figs. 12–15).
Another uncertainty must in general be taken into ac-
count in order to obtain a reliable estimate for the ﬁtted
quantity: the uncertainty in the data points. All the
curves presented in this appendix do contain error bars
that reﬂect the uncertainties on the estimates of (49) that
come from the uncertainties on the data points (50). We
evaluated the uncertainty associated to each ﬁt of p data
points (50) by calculating three ﬁts: a ﬁt with the mid-
dle values of the ordinates, a ﬁt with the higher values,
and a ﬁt with the lower values; the three estimates of
the ﬁtted quantity (49) obtained through this procedure
deﬁne an estimate with an error bar (see, e.g., Fig. 15).
Other ways of estimating the uncertainty in the ﬁt re-
sult can be used; a good choice of uncertainty evaluation
yields successive estimates of the ﬁtted quantity that are
compatible with a smooth curve of estimates [see, e.g.,
Fig. 15, where the less precise estimates of limit (49) lie
in the prolongation of the more precise values, which are
on the right of the plot].

One of the advantages of the local-ﬁt method pre-
sented in this appendix is that data points that are lo-
cated far from the abscissa of interest (1/l = 0, here)
can be fruitfully be used in evaluating the ﬁtted quan-
tity [limit (49), in our example]. Thus, as Fig. 15 illus-
trates, data points (50) with “large” abscissas can yield
more precise estimates of limit (49) than data points with
small abscissas. This behavior is particularly useful when
data points in the region of interest have relatively large
uncertainties.

The procedure detailed in this Appendix also allows
one to study the quality of lists of numerical results that
should lie on a smooth curve, but whose coherence is not
obvious through a simple inspection or plot of the values.
In fact, curves such as those found in Figs. 12–15 can be
very sensitive to small errors in a list of numerical values.
We have not noticed such errors in the A60 values Ta-
bles I and II while evaluating the asymptotic coeﬃcients
reported in Table VIII; this provided an additional check
of the values of these tables (see also Sec. VII).

The local-ﬁt method described here is not restricted
to the asymptotic study of the Bethe logarithm that we
have used as an example. In general, it can yield precise
estimates of quantities that are local to a set of data point
[such as limit (49)], including, for instance, perturbation
coeﬃcients of non-analytic expansions [e.g., Eq. (5)].

FIG. 13: From the lower to the higher curve: estimates of
limit (49) obtained through ﬁts of the data points (50) with
polynomials of degree 1 (see also Fig. 12), 3 and 5 (see also
Fig. 14). Fitting the data points (50) of Fig. (11) with 1 to 6
points yielded mutually coherent estimates of limit (49) with
an exponentially decreasing error.

FIG. 14: This ﬁgure shows estimates of limit (49) obtained by
ﬁtting the data points (50) in Fig. 11 with ﬁfth-degree poly-
nomials (in 1/l). The high relative stability of the estimates
as 1/l → 0 allowed us to give the precise value −0.056853(2)
in Eq. (37) for limit (49).

quences of only six data points. The accuracy of the local ﬁts
performed here ﬁrst increases with the order of the local ap-
proximations to the data points (50) (see Fig. 13), and then
eventually decreases (compare this plot to Fig. 14).

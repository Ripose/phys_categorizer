The frequency comb created by a femtosecond mode-locked laser and a microstructured ﬁber
is used to phase coherently measure the frequencies of both the Hg+ and Ca optical standards
with respect to the SI second as realized at NIST. We ﬁnd the transition frequencies to be fHg =
1 064 721 609 899 143(10) Hz and fCa = 455 986 240 494 158(26) Hz, respectively. In addition to
the unprecedented precision demonstrated here, this work is the precursor to all-optical atomic clocks
based on the Hg+ and Ca standards. Furthermore, when combined with previous measurements,
we ﬁnd no time variations of these atomic frequencies within the uncertainties of |(∂fCa/∂t)/fCa| ≤
8 × 10−14 yr−1, and |(∂fHg/∂t)/fHg| ≤ 30 × 10−14 yr−1.

Optical standards based on a single ion or a collection
of laser-cooled atoms are emerging as the most stable
and accurate frequency sources of any sort [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
However, because of their high frequencies (∼ 500 THz),
it has proven diﬃcult to count cycles as required for
building an optical clock and comparing to the cesium
microwave standard. Only recently, a reliable and conve-
nient optical clockwork fast enough to count optical oscil-
lations has been realized [6, 7, 8]. Here, we report an op-
tical clockwork based on a single femtosecond laser that
phase coherently divides down the visible radiation of
the Hg+ and Ca optical frequency standards to a count-
able radio frequency. By this means we determine the
absolute frequencies of these optical transitions with un-
paralleled precision in terms of the SI second as realized
at NIST [9]. Indeed, for the Hg+ standard, the statis-
tical uncertainty in the measurement is essentially lim-
ited by our knowledge of the SI second at ∼ 2 × 10−15.
The high precision and high demonstrated stability of
the standards[1, 4] combined with the straightforward
femtosecond-laser-based clockwork suggest Hg+ and Ca
as excellent references for future all-optical clocks. Addi-
tionally, the comparison of atomic frequencies over time
provides constraints on the possible time variation of fun-
damental constants. When combined with previous mea-
surements, the current level of precision allows us to place
the tightest constraint yet on the possible variation of op-
tical frequencies with respect to the cesium standard.

The Hg+ and Ca systems have recently been described
elsewhere[1, 4, 10, 11], so we summarize only the ba-
sic features. The heart of the mercury optical frequency
standard is a single, laser-cooled 199Hg+ ion that is stored
in a cryogenic, radio frequency spherical Paul trap. The
2S1/2(F = 0, MF = 0) ↔ 2D5/2(F = 2, MF = 0)
electric-quadrupole transition at 282 nm [Fig. 1(a)] pro-
vides the reference for the optical standard [1]. We lock
the frequency-doubled output of a well-stabilized 563 nm
dye laser to the center of the quadrupole resonance by ir-

radiating the Hg+ ion alternately at two frequencies near
the maximum slope of the resonance signal and on op-
posite sides of its center. Transitions to the metastable
2D5/2 state are detected with near unit eﬃciency since
the absorption of a single 282 nm photon suppresses the
scattering of many 194 nm photons on the strongly al-
lowed 2S1/2 −2 P1/2 transition[12, 13]. Usually, 48 mea-
surements are made on each side of the resonance prior
to correcting the average frequency of the 282 nm source.
If an asymmetry between the number of excitations de-
tected on the high- and low-frequency sides is found,
then the frequency of the probe radiation is adjusted to
minimize the asymmetry. In this way, we steer the fre-
quency of the 282 nm source to the center of the S − D
quadrupole resonance with an imprecision that decreases
as the square root of the measurement time. In Fig. 1(b)
we show an example of a normalized spectrum that was
obtained from multiple bidirectional scans through the
resonance during the lock-up, where the probe time was
20 ms. Most often, the frequency was locked to resonance
with a 10 ms interrogation period, which provided a frac-
tional frequency instability reaching 3 × 10−15τ −1/2 for
an averaging time τ measured in seconds [14].

The calcium standard is based on a collection of ∼ 107
laser-cooled 40Ca atoms held in a magnetooptic trap.
The 423 nm 1S0 ↔ 1P1 transition is used for Doppler
cooling and trapping the atoms to a residual tempera-
ture of ∼ 2 mK, while the 657 nm 1S0(MJ = 0) ↔
3P1(MJ = 0) clock transition (400 Hz natural linewidth)
is used for the frequency standard [Fig 2(a)]. We ex-
cite the clock transition with a four-pulse Bord´e-Ramsey
sequence (pulse duration = 1.5 µs) with light from a
continuous wave (CW) frequency-stabilized diode laser.
Using a shelving detection technique similar to that
employed in the Hg+ system, near-resonant 423 nm
pulses (5 µs duration) are used before and after the
657 nm excitation to determine the fraction of atoms
transferred from the ground state. Figure 2(b) shows

Bord´e-Ramsey fringes taken at a resolution of 960 Hz.
This system has demonstrated a fractional frequency in-
stability of 4 × 10−15τ −1/2, when probing sub-kilohertz
linewidths [4]. For the measurements presented here the
Ca spectrometer was operated with linewidths ranging
from 0.96 to 11.55 kHz which are integer subharmonics
of the recoil splitting.

The recent introduction of mode-locked lasers to op-
tical frequency metrology greatly simpliﬁes the task of
optical frequency measurements [6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17]. The
spectrum emitted by a mode locked laser consists of a
comb of regular spaced continuous waves that are sepa-
rated by the pulse repetition rate fr. The frequency of
the nth mode of the comb is given by fn = nfr+fo [18, 19]
where fo is the frequency oﬀset common to all modes
that is caused by the diﬀerence between the group- and
the phase-velocity inside the laser cavity. Whereas fr
can be measured by direct detection of the laser out-
put with a photodiode, fo is measured by heterodyn-
ing the harmonic of a mode fn = nfr + fo from the
infrared wing of the comb with a mode f2n = 2nfr + fo
from the blue side of the comb [7, 8]. While an oc-
tave spanning comb can be produced directly from a
mode-locked laser [20], launching the longer pulses from
a commercially-available femtosecond laser into an air-
silica microstructure ﬁber [21, 22] also produces a fre-
quency comb that spans an octave. Via nonlinear pro-
cesses in the ﬁber, additional equally spaced and phase-
coherent modes are added to the comb.
It has been
demonstrated that this process of spectral broadening
preserves the uniformity of spacing and spectral ﬁdelity
of the comb to at least a few parts in 1016 [8].

We couple approximately 200 mW average power from
a femtosecond Ti:sapphire ring laser(fr ≈ 1 GHz)[23]
into a 15 cm piece of a microstructure ﬁber that has a
1.7 µm core and a group velocity dispersion that vanishes
near 770 nm[21]. This power is suﬃcient to increase the
spectral width of the laser from 13 THz to more than
300 THz, spanning from ∼ 520 nm to ∼ 1170 nm. The
infrared part of the comb from the ﬁber (λ ≈ 1060 nm)
is split oﬀ by a dichroic mirror and frequency doubled
into the green portion of the visible spectrum with a
2 mm long KNbO3 crystal. Following an adjustable
delay line that matches the optical path lengths, the
frequency-doubled light is spatially combined with the
green part of the original comb using a polarizing beam
splitter. A second rotatable polarizer projects the po-
larization of the combined beams onto a common axis
so that they can interfere on a photodiode. This polar-
izer is also used to adjust the relative power of the two
beams for optimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the
heterodyne signal. A small grating prior to the photodi-
ode helps to select only that part of the frequency comb
that matches the frequency-doubled light, thereby reduc-
ing noise from unwanted comb lines [19]. We phase-lock
both fo and fr to synthesized frequencies derived from a

2

cavity-tuned hydrogen maser. Control of fr is achieved
with a cavity folding mirror that is mounted on a piezo
transducer, while fo is controlled by adjusting the 532 nm
pump beam intensity with an electro-optic modulator [8].
When fo and fr are both phase-locked, the frequency of
every mode in the comb is known with the same precision
as the reference maser.

The CW light from the Hg+ (563 nm) and Ca (657 nm)
spectrometers is transferred to the mode-locked laser sys-
tem via two single mode optical ﬁbers that are 130 m and
10 m long, respectively. Approximately 2 mW of CW
light from each ﬁber is mode-matched with the appropri-
ate spectral region of the frequency comb to generate a
beat signal fb with a nearby mode. This beat note is am-
pliﬁed and measured with a radio frequency counter. The
optical frequency is then expressed as fopt = fo+mfr+fb,
where m is a large integer uniquely determined for each
system from previous coarse measurements of fopt.

We detect cycle slips in both of the phase-locks by
monitoring fr and fo with additional counters [24]. We
selectively discard any measurement of fopt for which the
measured fo or fr deviate from the expected value by
more than 1/τgate, where τgate is the counter gate time
in seconds. We avoid miscounts of fb by using an auxil-
iary counter to record the ratio r between fb and fb/4,
where the division by 4 is implemented digitally. Any
measurements of fb where the auxiliary counter gives a
result that does not satisfy (r − 4) ∗ fb < 10/τgate are dis-
carded. We rely on the assumption that the two counters
recording fb and r, if in disagreement, do not make the
same mistake. For each data point the three additional
counters (fr, fo and r) are started before the counting of
fb, and operated with 50 ms longer gate times to ensure
temporal overlap.

Figure 3 summarizes the frequency measurements of
Hg+ made between Aug. 16 and Aug 31, 2000, and Fig. 4
summarizes the Ca measurements made from Oct. 26 to
Nov. 17, 2000. All measurements are corrected daily
for the second-order Zeeman shift and for the oﬀset of
the reference maser frequency. The uncertainty for the
Zeeman correction is < 1 × 10−15 for the Hg+ system
and < 2.5 × 10−15 in the Ca system. The frequency of
the maser is calibrated by comparing to the local NIST
time scale (5 hydrogen masers and 3 commercial cesium
clocks), which in turn is calibrated by the local cesium
fountain standard (NIST-F1 [9]) as well as international
cesium standards. This resulted in a fractional uncer-
tainty in the frequency of the reference maser of about
1.8 × 10−15 for the measurements.

The weighted mean of our measurements of the Hg+
clock transition is fHg = 1 064 721 609 899 143 Hz,
where the statistical uncertainty of 2.4 Hz is near the
fractional frequency instability of the reference maser
(∼ 2 × 10−13 at 1s, decreasing to ∼ 4 × 10−16 at a few
days). Since we have not made a full evaluation of the
Hg+-standard, we only estimate the total systematic un-

certainty to be 10 Hz. The dominant systematic con-
tribution to the uncertainty of the S − D transition fre-
quency is believed to be the electric-quadrupole shift of
the 2D5/2 state arising from coupling with the static po-
tentials of the trap.
In our spherical Paul trap, where
the conﬁnement of the ion uses no static applied ﬁelds,
the maximum quadrupole shift should be less than 1 Hz
(or a fractional frequency shift < 10−15)[25]. In princi-
ple, it is possible to eliminate the quadrupole shift by
averaging the S − D transition frequencies for three mu-
tually orthogonal orientations of a quantizing magnetic
ﬁeld of constant magnitude. In the present experiment,
we have measured the S − D frequency for various ﬁeld
values, but we have made no attempt to eliminate the
quadrupole shift by using three orthogonal ﬁelds of con-
stant magnitude. No shift of the resonance frequency is
observed within the precision of these measurements. We
anticipate that the uncertainties of all systematic shifts
in the Hg+ system can be reduced to values approaching
1 × 10−18 [1, 25].

For the Ca data shown [Fig. 4], an additional correction
is applied each day to account for a frequency shift caused
by residual phase chirping on the optical Ramsey pulses
produced by amplitude modulating an acoustooptic mod-
ulator (AOM). The phase chirping produced a resolution
dependent frequency shift on the order of 100 Hz for
11.5 kHz wide fringes but only 10 Hz for 0.96 kHz wide
fringes. On each day, the Ca frequency was measured for
∼ 30 minutes at each of several fringe resolutions, and the
zero-intercept of a linear ﬁt to the data was used as the
corrected frequency. On the last 3 days of measurements,
we were able to reduce this shift by a factor of ∼ 3 with
improvements to the RF pulses that drive the AOM’s.
The statistical uncertainty for each day’s measurement
(typically 8 Hz) is smaller than the uncontrolled system-
atic uncertainties in the the Ca frequency. The largest
systematic uncertainty stems from incomplete knowledge
of the angular overlap of the counterpropagating beams
in the Ca spectrometer, combined with a transverse drift
velocity of the cold Ca ensemble. This leads to a resid-
ual ﬁrst-order Doppler shift with a magnitude < 15 Hz
(except on Nov. 16 where a large drift velocity led to a
∼ 52 Hz uncertainty). Other signiﬁcant uncertainties in-
clude our lack of knowledge or control of electronic oﬀsets
and baseline asymmetries (< 12 Hz), wavefront curvature
(< 10 Hz), and cold-atom collisional shifts (< 10 Hz).
Taking all known systematic uncertainties in quadrature
gives a conﬁdence level of ∼ 26 Hz for the measured mean
value as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 4.

Figure 4 also shows the good agreement between our
measurement and the most recent value measured with a
harmonic frequency chain [26], which provides a degree of
conﬁdence in the reproducibility of the Ca standards. An
additional measure of the Ca frequency can be made by
using the present absolute measurement of Hg+ and our
earlier measurement of the 76 374 564 455 429(40) Hz

3

gap between fHg/2 the and Ca standard [27]. This yields
a value fCa = 455 986 240 494 143(40) Hz in good agree-
ment with the present absolute measurement of fCa.

Finally, these results also provide data on the rela-
tive time variability of atomic frequencies. S. Karshen-
boim has recently reviewed the implications of such com-
parisons and their contribution toward constraining the
possible time variation of fundamental constants [28].
In this regard Hg+ and Ca are two of the most inter-
esting cases to study. Comparing our present measure-
ment of fCa to measurements made by PTB in 1997[26]
gives (∂fCa/∂t)/fCa = (+2 ± 8) × 10−14 yr−1. Sim-
ilarly, combining this result with our May 2000 mea-
surement of fHg with respect to fCa[27] provides an ini-
tial baseline constraint on the time variation of fHg of
(∂fHg/∂t)/fHg = (−7 ± 30) × 10−14 yr−1. Here we use
the deﬁned unit of time based on the frequency of the Cs
hyperﬁne interval and assume that any time dependence
is slow and dominantly linear over the relevant time scale.
At our present level of precision we ﬁnd no evidence of
any relative time variation between these three frequency
standards, two optical and one microwave.

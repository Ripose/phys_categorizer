We demonstrate the production of ultracold polar RbCs molecules in their vibronic ground state,
via photoassociation of laser-cooled atoms followed by a laser-stimulated state transfer process. The
resulting sample of X 1Σ+(v = 0) molecules has a translational temperature of ∼ 100 µK and a
narrow distribution of rotational states. With the method described here it should be possible to
produce samples even colder in all degrees of freedom, as well as other bi-alkali species.

Samples of ultracold, polar molecules (UPMs) can pro-
vide access to new regimes in many phenomena. Ultra-
cold temperatures allow trapping, and polarity can be
used to engineer large, anisotropic, and tunable interac-
tions between molecules. These features make UPMs at-
tractive as qubits for quantum computation [1], as build-
ing blocks for novel types of many-body systems [2], and
for the study of chemistry in the ultracold regime [3].
Furthermore, UPMs can be used as uniquely sensitive
probes of phenomena beyond the Standard Model of par-
ticle physics [4].

Methods such as buﬀer-gas cooling [5], Stark-slowing
[6], billiard-like collisions [7], and velocity ﬁltering [8]
have produced samples of polar molecules at temper-
atures of ∼ 10–100 mK. Formation of heteronuclear
molecules from pre-cooled atoms via photoassociation
(PA) [9, 10, 11, 12] or Feshbach resonance techniques
[13] promises access to much lower temperatures; how-
ever, these processes leave molecules in highly excited
vibrational levels, which have vanishingly small polar-
ity [14] and are unstable to collisions [15, 16]. The pos-
sibility of transferring such molecules to their vibronic
ground state, via optical processes such as stimulated
Raman transitions, has been discussed extensively (see
e.g.
[1, 17, 18, 19, 20]); however, insuﬃcient data on
the structure of experimentally accessible molecules has
made it diﬃcult to identify speciﬁc pathways for eﬃcient
transfer.

Here we report the production of UPMs via PA of
laser-cooled Rb and Cs atoms, followed by a two-step
stimulated emission pumping (SEP) process. This yields
RbCs molecules in their absolute vibronic ground state
X 1Σ+(v = 0). These polar molecules (calculated elec-
tric dipole moment µ ≈ 1.3 D [21]) have a translational
temperature of ∼ 100 µK. The distribution of rotational
states is also quite narrow, so the resulting sample of
X 1Σ+ state molecules is cold in all degrees of freedom.
Figure 1 shows the methods by which we produce and
detect UPMs. A pair of colliding, ultracold Rb and Cs
atoms is photoassociated, i.e., the pair absorbs a pho-
ton and is driven to an electronically excited molecular
level [22]. This level decays rapidly, with branching frac-

tion of ∼ 7% into the long-lived a3Σ+(v = 37) level [9].
After a period of PA, a resonant laser pulse (“pump”
pulse) transfers these metastable, vibrationally excited
molecules to an intermediate, electronically excited state
(i). The population of state i is monitored by applying an
intense laser pulse (“ionization” pulse), with a frequency
chosen to selectively form a RbCs+ molecular ion. We
detect these ions using time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy.
To produce X(v = 0) molecules, a second tunable laser
pulse (“dump” pulse), arriving just after the pump pulse,
resonantly drives molecules in state i to the X(v = 0)
(or, for diagnostic purposes, v = 1) state. Transfer to
the X(v = 0, 1) states is indicated by a depletion of the i
state population. This method [23] generally works well,
but is complicated by the presence of additional resonant
features associated with transitions from state i upward
into other, spectrally uncharacterized excited states.

We thus employ a second method to directly detect
the RbCs X(v = 0, 1) molecules. After the dump pulse,
the population of state i is allowed to decay for several
times its spontaneous emission lifetime, leaving essen-
tially no population in this level. Next a third pulse (“re-
excitation” pulse), identical in frequency to the dump,
drives the stable X 1Σ+(v = 0, 1) molecules back into
state i, where they are detected via ionization as before.
The ion signal is monitored as the frequency of the iden-
tical dump and re-excitation pulses is scanned; a peak
in this signal indicates that molecules have been reso-
nantly transferred to the X 1Σ+(v = 0, 1) states by the
dump pulse, then back to the i state by the re-excitation
pulse. The deﬁnitive signatures of UPM production are
resonances at the exact frequencies predicted by earlier
spectroscopy of the a3Σ+, i [9, 18], and X 1Σ+ levels [24].
is in the manifold of levels associated
with the overlapping electronic states c3Σ+, b3Π, and
B1Π. Speciﬁcally, the states chosen for i have predom-
inantly c3Σ+
1 character, with small admixtures of b3Π1
(due to non-adiabatic couplings of the potentials) and
B1Π1 (due to spin-orbit coupling). The mixed c/B state
composition of i is crucial to the technique (the small b
state admixture is incidental). The c3Σ+ component of
the i state has reasonable Franck-Condon (FC) overlap

collected in a dual-species, forced dark SPOT magneto-
optical trap (MOT) [25, 26, 27]. The atomic density
n and atom number N were nRb = 1 × 1011 cm−3,
NRb = 2 × 108, and nCs = 3 × 1011 cm3, NCs = 3 × 108.
The temperature of both species was ∼ 75 µK. The atoms
were photoassociated by a Ti:Sapphire laser with inten-
2
sity of ∼ 3 kW/m
Its frequency was locked to an
Ω = 0−, J P = 1+ level, located 38.02 cm−1 below the
Rb 5S1/2(F = 2) + Cs 6P1/2(F = 3) atomic asymptote.
All other laser light consisted of pulses with ∼ 5 ns
duration and ∼ 3 mm diam. The pump pulse was gen-
erated from a tunable dye laser operating from 18100–
18600 cm−1 at a 10 Hz repetition rate with a spectral
linewidth of ∼ 0.05 cm−1. This output was sent through a
H2 Raman cell; the second Stokes order (down-shifted by
2 × 4155.25 cm1) was separated to form the pump pulse,
2
with a typical intensity of 20 J/m
and frequency from
9800-10300 cm−1. The dump and re-excitation pulses
were generated using an additional dye laser (the “red”
laser) operating from 13500-14000 cm−1 with a spectral
linewidth of ∼ 0.2 cm−1; each had a typical intensity of
2
3 J/m
. The ionizing pulse (at 532 nm) was derived from
the second harmonic of the Nd:YAG laser used to pump
2
the dye lasers, and had an intensity of 100 J/m

.

The red and ionizing beams were spatially combined
using a dichroic mirror with the ionizing pulse propa-
gating 4 ns behind the red pulse. These combined beams
were sent through a beam splitter. In one half of the split
two-color beam, the optical path length was adjusted
such that the red dump pulse reached the molecules 7 ns
after the pump pulse. The other half of the two-color
beam was sent through a 22 m long multimode optical
ﬁber; with this delay, the red re-excitation pulse arrived
110 ns after the dump pulse.

Laser frequencies were measured using a wavelength
meter with 0.05 cm−1 accuracy. Ions were detected us-
ing a channeltron located ∼ 3 cm from the atoms. The
digitized channeltron current yields a time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrum, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The tempera-
ture of the molecules in the a3Σ+ state was measured as
described in Ref. [8]. The scattering of two photons nec-
essary to transfer the population to the X(v = 0) state
should not cause signiﬁcant heating.

For a particular choice of state i, we scanned the fre-
quency of the red laser through the predicted energy
splitting between the chosen level and the X 1Σ+(v =
0, 1) states. We observed transfer to the ground states via
several of these levels. Results are shown for three such
intermediate states i, consecutive in energy, in Fig. 2.

The locations of the resonant features are in excellent
agreement with the known X(v = 0) − (v = 1) splitting
[24], and with our measured splitting of the i state levels.
In Fig. 2c, a scan over the region between the v = 0 and
v = 1 resonances shows features only at the predicted
locations. As a cross-check, we also deliberately chose as
state i the Ω = 0− component of a mixed c3Σ+/b3Π level.

with the initial a3Σ+(v = 37) state, due to the near-
coincidence of the inner turning point of the a3Σ+ po-
tential with the minimum of the c3Σ+ potential [9, 18].
The B1Π component of state i circumvents the usual se-
lection rule forbidding transitions from the initial triplet
state a to the ﬁnal singlet state X. Moreover, the minima
of the B1Π and X 1Σ+ potentials nearly coincide, leading
to large FC factors for transfer to the X(v = 0) level.

The apparatus is similar to that described in our earlier
work [9]. Brieﬂy, 85Rb and 133Cs atoms were cooled and

similar pump eﬃciency (due to the comparable red and
pump laser linewidths). This low value is expected due to
the sparse comb-like spectral structure typical of pulsed
lasers with multiple longitudinal modes [28], such as that
used here. This structure implies that we would need to
broaden the transitions considerably in order to achieve
the theoretical maximum 25% transfer eﬃciency for SEP
with our current lasers.

By changing our experimental conditions in straight-
forward ways, the method described here can lead to
large rates of UPM production. Thirty-fold higher
a(v = 37) production rates could be achieved by re-
turning to our optimized MOT conditions [9]. Using
higher repetition rate pulsed lasers and/or trapping the
RbCs molecules could lead to ∼ 100% addressing of the
vibrationally excited molecules. Finally, using a stim-
ulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique
with transform-limited laser pulses [29, 30], the a(v = 37)
to X(v = 0) transfer eﬃciency would be ∼ 100%. With
these improvements, we project that the formation rate
of RbCs X(v = 0) molecules could approach 3 × 106/s.
Our X 1Σ+ molecular sample is of high purity with
respect to the vibrational degree of freedom. State i
is dominantly triplet in character and thus the proba-
bility of uncontrolled spontaneous decay to the X 1Σ+
state during the SEP step is extremely small. Using our
earlier analysis of the mixed c/B/b state structure [18],
we calculated branching ratios for decay of the i states.
While these calculations are only qualitative (due our in-
complete knowledge of the relevant state wavefunctions),
they indicate that the total population in all other vi-
brational levels of the X 1Σ+ state is only ∼ 1% of the
population driven into the v = 0 level. (Of course, there
remains a substantial background of a3Σ+ molecules.)

The rotational and hyperﬁne state distribution of the
X(v = 0) molecules is determined by selection rules and
by the spectral resolution of our lasers. Hyperﬁne struc-
ture (hfs) is unresolved in all stages of the process, and
hence the nuclear spin degrees of freedom are completely
unconstrained. However, the initial PA step selects a
level with well-deﬁned rotation/parity quantum numbers
J P = 1+. The three subsequent photons involved in the
transfer to the X state (one in spontaneous emission and
two in the SEP process) must leave the molecule in a
state of odd parity, and can add up to 3 units of angular
momentum. Noting that P = (−1)J for the X 1Σ+ state,
this suggests that only J = 1, 3 could be populated in
X(v = 0). However, in principle the molecule can also
acquire rotational angular momentum from the nuclear
spins, if the coupling between hfs and rotation is suﬃ-
ciently strong [31]. This can add up to IRb + ICs = 6
units of rotation (here Ix is the nuclear spin of species

states populated could increase to J = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

We derive an experimental bound on the spread of pop-
ulated rotational levels from the absence of large spectral

FIG. 2: (color online) Observation of X 1Σ+(v = 0, 1) state
molecules. Results are shown for i state depletion (upper) and
direct detection (lower) for three consecutive states i, located
at energies of (a) 9754.26 cm−1, (b) 9814.60 cm−1, and (c)
−1 above the a3Σ+(v = 37) state. In (c), the region
9786.10 cm
between the v = 0 and v = 1 resonances is shown to have
no additional features for direct detection. The dotted lines
indicate the predicted dump laser frequency for the desired
transition.

Here, selection rules rigorously prevent coupling to the
X 1Σ+ state, and as expected we observe no evidence for
transfer. Finally, we determined the strength of the i−X
transitions by increasing the red laser intensity until the
resonant features broadened. The observed saturation
2
intensities (typically ∼ 4 J/m
) agree qualitatively with
those predicted from calculated FC factors and electronic
transition moments [18].

Presently, we detect ∼ 1 ion per pulse. This indicates
a production rate of ∼ 2 × 102 UPMs/s, subject to uncer-
tainties in the channeltron gain and ionization eﬃciency.
Based on the agreement between observed and predicted
rates, this ﬁgure should be correct to within a factor of
∼ 2. The UPM production rate is suboptimal for a few
reasons. First, MOT densities were not optimized for
this work. Second, the molecules are untrapped, and
most leave the region before our low repetition-rate lasers
can transfer them. Finally, the eﬃciency of the SEP is
only ∼ 6%. This is determined by the measured ∼ 25%
dump and re-excitation eﬃciencies and our inference of a

shifts of the observed resonances from their predicted
J = 0 locations. Our observations deviate by no more
than 0.3 cm−1 from these predictions, which have an un-
certainty of ±0.6 cm−1 [18]. Using the known rotational
constant Be = 0.017 cm−1 [24], we conclude that at most,
J = 1, 3, 5, and 7 are populated.

The spectral width of the dump and re-excitation reso-
nances suggests an even narrower rotational distribution.
A typical linewidth of 0.18 cm−1 (obtained by subtract-
ing, in quadrature, our laser linewidth from the mea-
sured resonance width) agrees well with the predicted
0.17 cm−1 splitting between the J = 1 and 3 levels. This
suggests that the hfs/rotation coupling may be absent
(or weak), and that indeed only two rotational levels
(J = 1, 3) are populated in our experiments.

In future work, we expect to produce molecules in a
single rotational level by using transform-limited laser
pulses capable of resolving rotational structure.
(Such
narrowband lasers are required in any case for eﬃcient
STIRAP transfer to X(v = 0)). State selection of hfs
may also be possible by the use of spin-polarized atoms
plus judicious choices of laser polarizations and hfs-
resolved transitions for PA and state transfer. This would
also further increase the rate of X(v = 0) molecule pro-
duction, since currently the spread of population among
hfs sublevels in the a(v = 37) state limits the fraction
available for transfer to the i state.

Finally, we point out that this method for UPM pro-
duction is quite general. Mixing of the c3Σ+ and B1Π
levels, as well as the favorable location of the poten-
tial curves, is present in all bi-alkali dimers [19]. Al-
though such spin-orbit mixing increases with the mass
of the molecules [33], it may be suﬃciently large even
for the lightest heteronuclear bi-alkali (LiNa). Also, the
SEP method is fairly insensitive to the initial vibra-
tional state and completely insensitive to molecular tem-
perature. Thus, higher phase space densities of UPMs
could be produced by photoassociating colder atoms or
by starting with molecules formed by Feshbach resonance
in a single a3Σ+ level [13].

In summary, we have produced ultracold polar RbCs
molecules in their ground vibronic state. The optical
transfer technique used here should be applicable to other
bi-alkali molecules. Translational temperatures limited
only by atomic cooling methods should be achievable.
The rotational distributions are limited only by laser
spectral linewidth; with commonly available technology,
population of a single rovibronic state with high purity
should be possible. This opens a route to the study and
manipulation of polar molecules in the ultracold regime.

[31] Strong hfs/rotation coupling requires that hfs be large
compared to rotational splittings. This cannot occur in
the X 1Σ+ or Ω = 0
PA states, where the small hfs [24,
25] arises only from electric quadrupole eﬀects. However,
strong hfs/rotation coupling could occur in the a3Σ+ and
c3Σ+ states, where magnetic dipole hfs is present [32].
Crude estimates indicate that hfs might exceed rotational
splittings for low-J levels in these states.

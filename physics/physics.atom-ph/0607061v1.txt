Nonlinear magneto-optical Faraday rotation (NMOR) on the potassium D1 and D2 lines was used
to study Zeeman relaxation rates in an antirelaxation paraﬃn-coated 3-cm diameter potassium vapor
cell. Intrinsic Zeeman relaxation rates of γNM OR/2π = 2.0(6) Hz were observed. The relatively small
hyperﬁne intervals in potassium lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in NMOR in potassium compared to
rubidium and cesium. Using laser optical pumping, widths and frequency shifts were also determined
for transitions between ground-state hyperﬁne sublevels of 39K atoms contained in the same paraﬃn-
coated cell. The intrinsic hyperﬁne relaxation rate of γhf
expt/2π = 10.6(7) Hz and a shift of −9.1(2) Hz
were observed. These results show that adiabatic relaxation gives only a small contribution to the
overall hyperﬁne relaxation in the case of potassium, and the relaxation is dominated by other
mechanisms similar to those observed in previous studies with rubidium.

INTRODUCTION

The drive to develop small atomic clocks, gyroscopes,
and magnetometers has drawn interest to miniature
antirelaxation-coated alkali-atom vapor cells near 1 mm3
in volume (see for example Ref.
[1] and references
therein). The large surface-to-volume ratio of small vapor
cells means that the interactions of the conﬁned atoms
with the cell walls are particularly important. These in-
teractions can cause spin de-coherence and limit the per-
formance of such cells in atomic clocks and magnetome-
ters. The use of antirelaxation coatings reduces these
eﬀects and may provide an alternative to small buﬀer
gas cells [2].

In this research, we study nonlinear magneto-optical
rotation and the Zeeman and hyperﬁne relaxation rates
in potassium atoms in a paraﬃn-coated vapor cell. Simi-
lar investigations in rubidium and cesium vapor cells have
yielded information on relaxation mechanisms for these
atoms in coated cells [1, 3], and contributed to the de-
velopment of sensitive nonlinear-optical-rotation magne-
tometers that are used, for example, for detecting nuclear
magnetization [4, 5].

In addition to yielding information on the wall-
relaxation processes, these measurements are also mo-
tivated by an idea that the use of K atoms in secondary
frequency references (clocks) may be advantageous com-
pared to the use of Rb or Cs.

A ﬁgure of merit for a frequency reference is δν/ν,
where ν is the frequency of the transition, and δν is the
absolute frequency stability that scales with the transi-
tion width. Suppose that the width of the hyperﬁne-
structure transition is dominated by adiabatic collisions.
It has been established that for such collisions, the aver-
age phase shift during a collision is proportional, among
other factors, to the hyperﬁne-structure frequency ν (see,
for example, Refs. [1, 13] and a detailed discussion and
further references in Ref.
[14], Ch. 3.4). Since the re-
laxation rate scales as the square of the phase shift, a
lower-frequency alkali hyperﬁne-structure transition (for
example, the hyperﬁne-structure transition in 41K at
ν ≈ 254 MHz) may turn out to be advantageous for a
clock.

The signiﬁcantly smaller hyperﬁne-structure intervals
of potassium lead to a considerably diﬀerent, generally,
much smaller nonlinear Faraday rotation associated with
creation and detection of atomic alignment. Here we
study some speciﬁc features of the nonlinear magneto-
optical rotation in potassium and measure the rate of its
spin relaxation. A comparison with the results for other
alkali atoms will enable a better understanding of the
mechanisms that cause spin relaxation, and aid in deter-
mining the feasibility of making ultra-sensitive magne-
tometers and small atomic clocks using paraﬃn-coated
cells. This work is also complementary to the studies of
spin-exchange relaxation in potassium [6, 7].

The cell studied in this work contains potassium with
a natural abundance (39K : 93.26%,40 K : 0.012%,41 K :
6.7%). The overwhelming abundance of 39K in compari-
son with the other two isotopes makes the contribution of
this isotope to magneto-optical rotation dominant. Thus
in the following, we will only be concerned with 39K.

The hyperﬁne structure of 39K consists of F = 1, 2 hy-
perﬁne levels in the 4 2S1/2 ground state, with an energy
splitting of 462 MHz. The upper levels of interest in this
work are the 4 2P1/2 and 4 2P3/2 (Fig.1).

compared with rubidium and cesium where the upper-
state hyperﬁne intervals are on the order of the Doppler
width.

FIG. 1: Hyperﬁne splitting of low-lying levels of 39K.

Faraday rotation due to coherence eﬀects (see, for ex-
ample, review [8]) relies on the ability to create and de-
tect atomic alignment in the ground state. The alignment
is produced via the atoms’ interactions with resonant lin-
early polarized light which optically pumps the atoms. In
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the alignment evolves
(in the case of weak light ﬁeld, the evolution is Larmor
precession; a more complex evolution occurs at elevated
light powers [9]). The optical anisotropy of the evolved
medium results in a rotation of the light polarization.

The extent to which alignment can be created in
the ground state by optical pumping and the optical
anisotropy associated with this alignment both depend
on the upper-state hyperﬁne structure being resolved.
The reason for this is that the electronic angular mo-
mentum of the initial state is J = 1/2, and such a state
cannot support polarization moments with rank κ higher
than 2J = 1. Optical rotation via the mechanism dis-
cussed here requires κ = 2 (alignment; see, for instance,
Ref. [8]). In the limit where hyperﬁne structure is com-
pletely unresolved, we can neglect the nuclear-spin part
of the wavefunction. However, since the electronic state
cannot support alignment, it is impossible to create or
detect alignment of the initial state with light.

In 39K, the splitting of the 2P1/2 state is 55.6 MHz,
and the splittings of the 2P3/2 state are 44.4 MHz, 20.4
MHz, and 7.5 MHz. The Doppler width in this work is
≈ 500 MHz, thus there is a considerable suppression of
nonlinear Faraday rotation on both the D1 and D2 lines

II. APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE

We employ the technique of nonlinear magneto-optical
rotation with frequency modulated light (FM NMOR)
[10] and study the zero-ﬁeld FM NMOR resonance. The
signal we detect is the amplitude of optical rotation syn-
chronous with the laser-frequency modulation.

The experimental apparatus (Fig. 2) incorporates a
spherical glass cell with inner diameter of 3 cm and inner
walls coated with paraﬃn. A sample of solid potassium
metal is contained in a stem connected to the cell with an
opening approximately 2 mm in diameter. The cell was
made by M. V. Balabas using the technology outlined,
for example, in Ref. [11].

The cell is placed within a magnetic shielding assembly.
The shielding consists of three nested 0.5-mm thick lay-
ers of Co-Netic AA high-permeability alloy. Each layer is
cylindrical in shape. Starting with the innermost shield-
ing layer, the radii of the layers are 5.08, 8.26, and 11.43
cm, with lengths of 21.33, 26.90, and 35.56 cm, respec-
tively. Within the magnetic shielding is a set of coils
for application of magnetic ﬁelds and gradients, allowing
us to reduce the eﬀects of residual magnetization in the
shielding, and to investigate nonlinear magneto-optical
rotation as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetic
ﬁelds can be applied along the direction of the cylinder,
which we deﬁne as the z-axis, as well as along the two
transverse axes, x and y. There are two additional sets
of coils for the ∂Bz/∂z and ∂Bx/∂x − ∂By/∂y gradient
ﬁelds. The presence of magnetic ﬁelds transverse to the
direction of light propagation changes the shape of the
longitudinal magnetic-ﬁeld dependence of the optical ro-
tation [12]. By applying magnetic ﬁelds in the transverse
x- and y-directions, and scanning the magnetic ﬁeld in
the z-direction, we were able to compensate, using the
observed lineshapes, the residual magnetic ﬁelds along
the x and y directions to within ≈ 0.5 µG.

Laser light from a New Focus Velocity diode laser (that
could be tuned to either D1 or D2 transition) was fre-
quency modulated by scanning the external cavity of the
laser with a piezo-electric actuator. The frequency of the
light was modulated at 1 kHz with a modulation depth
of ≈ 400 MHz. Part of the laser light was sent to an un-
coated potassium vapor cell used as a reference for fre-
quency stabilization purposes. The remaining light was
attenuated and sent to the coated vapor cell.

At room temperature the density of potassium atoms
is ≈ 3 · 108 atoms/cm3. Heating the reference cell to
≈ 100◦C increases this density to ≈ 5 · 1011 atoms/cm3.
The laser light that passed through the reference cell was
detected with a photodiode and demodulated with a lock-
in ampliﬁer that monitored the second harmonic of the
photodiode signal. This signal was digitized with a data

acquisition board and was kept at a ﬁxed level by gener-
ating a computer-controlled voltage which was fed back
to the frequency-control input of the laser.

The coated vapor cell was also heated. Plastic tub-
ing with 0.4-cm diameter was wrapped into ten turns
with a ≈ 10-cm diameter. These coils were attached to a
Teﬂon cell holder using four Teﬂon posts extending from
the holder. Pressurized air was run through copper tub-
ing placed in boiling water and sent through the tubing
surrounding the cell. The hot air in the tubing convec-
tively heated the air surrounding the vapor cell. Based
on unsaturated resonance atomic absorption of ≈ 10% for
the D1 transition and ≈ 20% for the D2 transition, the
atomic density was estimated as 5 · 109 cm−3. This cor-
responds to an estimated temperature of the cell of 47oC
(neglecting possible deviations from the saturated-vapor
density that may occur in a coated cell).

The light that has passed through the vapor cell was
analyzed with a balanced polarimeter incorporating a po-
larization prism and two large-area photodiodes. The
output of the photodiodes was sent to the diﬀerential
input of a lock-in ampliﬁer whose ﬁrst-harmonic output
was digitized and recorded by the computer.

FIG. 2: Schematic diagram of experimental setup for mea-
surement of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation. For the mea-
surement of the transitions between hyperﬁne levels, the bal-
anced polarimeter was replaced with a single photodiode. An
rf loop was introduced next to the vapor cell trough one of
the ports in the magnetic shield.

Nonlinear Faraday rotation was measured at ﬁxed
tuning of the central frequency of the laser as a func-
tion of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld over the range
of ±800 µG. Measurements were done with laser-light
power going into the coated cell between 2 and 115 µW.
Over this range of light powers, there was considerable
variation of the magnitude and magnetic-ﬁeld depen-
dence of the Faraday-rotation.

The choice of the central laser frequency at which to

3

lock was determined by scanning over the potassium res-
onance with a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld. The laser central fre-
quency was then locked where the Faraday rotation sig-
nal was the largest. Once the lock point was determined,
the magnetic ﬁeld was scanned with decreasing and in-
creasing magnetic ﬁeld values symmetrically around zero
using a computer-generated triangular wave.

Several acquisitions were averaged before changing the
magnetic ﬁeld value. Scans at low light power, < 10 µW
lasted about 20 minutes, and scans at high light power,
> 15 µW, lasted about 4 minutes. Such long integration
times were necessary because the optical-rotation ampli-
tudes at the lowest light powers were as low as 10 µrad,
while the noise of the polarimeter exceeded the shot-noise
limit by a factor of a few.

III. RESULTS FOR ZEEMAN RELAXATION
RATES

The intrinsic Zeeman relaxation rate for a given va-
por cell can be found from the low-light-power limit of
the width of the Faraday rotation curves such as the one
shown in Fig. 3 [1, 12]. This is done by ﬁtting the am-
plitude as a function of magnetic ﬁeld to a dispersive
lineshape to determine the width at a given light power.
The intrinsic width is determined by linear extrapolation
of the power dependence of the widths. Figure 3 shows
typical data and ﬁt for the D1 transition.

Performing a linear extrapolation at light powers less
than 10 µW gives a light-independent magnetic ﬁeld
width of ∆B = 2.9(9) µG for the data taken with the D1
transition (Fig. 4). Here ∆B is the diﬀerence in the mag-
netic ﬁeld between the two extrema. This corresponds to
a Zeeman relaxation rate of

γN MOR/2π = gµ∆B = 2.0(6) Hz

(1)

(g is the ground-state Land´e factor; µ is the Bohr mag-
neton). The error bars for these data were increased by
about a factor of two compared to our estimates for in-
dividual ﬁts in order to obtain a reduced χ2 = 1.

Low-power data were also taken for the D2 transition.
In contrast to the D1 case, for the D2 transition evidence
of saturation was seen even at powers of just a few µW. In
this low-power regime, the signal sizes were on the order
of the background noise and we were unable to obtain
satisfactory data for the low powers required to get a
linear ﬁt (the D2 data alone would indicate an intrinsic
linewidth of ∆B <∼ 6 µG).

It is interesting to compare the present results for the
Zeeman relaxation rate with the results of Ref. [1] for Rb
at similar vapor densities.
In the work of Ref. [1] the
diameter of the vapor cells ranged from 3.4 cm to 10 cm
and the corresponding relaxation rates ranged between
3.5 and 0.7 Hz. An analysis of possible relaxation mech-
anisms, including spin-exchange relaxation, exchange of
atoms with the metal reservoir (the cell stem), etc., re-
sulted in a conclusion that an additional relaxation mech-

The relaxation rate due to exchange of atoms with the
stem is estimated to be ≈ 1 Hz with a large uncertainty
due to the diﬃculty of accounting for the speciﬁc geom-
etry of the stem. Therefore, the observed relaxation rate
is not inconsistent with the known sources of relaxation.
Additional relaxation mechanisms that were found with
Rb and Cs contribute to the NMOR linewidth at a level
∼ 1 Hz or less.

IV. SPECIFIC HIGH-POWER FEATURE OF
NMOR IN K

At suﬃciently high light power, a second narrower fea-
ture appears imbedded within the main Faraday rotation
curve (Fig. 5).

The nested Faraday curve is due to potassium’s rela-
tively small ground-state hyperﬁne splitting, in compari-
son to its Doppler width. The laser’s central frequency is
detuned ≈ 250 MHz to the low-frequency side of the ab-
sorption curve, so the light preferentially interacts with
the atoms in the F = 2 ground state. Thus, rotation of
the light polarization is due to precession of atomic align-
ment in the F = 2 hyperﬁne level. However, there is also
a contribution from the F = 1 hyperﬁne level since the
ground-state hyperﬁne structure is not well resolved. As
the laser light power is increased, the more resonant tran-
sition from the F = 2 hyperﬁne level is power-broadened
more than the less resonant transition from the F = 1 hy-
perﬁne level. Thus, rotation due to atomic alignment in
the F = 1 hyperﬁne level shows up as a narrower feature
nested within the power-broadened Faraday rotation due
to rotation of atomic alignment in the F = 2 hyperﬁne
level.

Here we present

the measurements of

intrinsic
linewidths and shifts of the hyperﬁne-structure transi-
tions performed with potassium atoms in the paraﬃn-
coated vapor cell.

Using the technique of optical pumping and radio-
optical double resonance [15], we investigated the “clock
transition” F = 1, M = 0 → F = 2, M = 0 in 39K, which
is to ﬁrst order insensitive to external DC magnetic ﬁelds
and gradients.

The apparatus and procedure were similar to those
described above, except, instead of optical rotation, we
measured the changes in transmission of the light through
optically pumped vapor when radio-frequency magnetic
ﬁeld driving the hyperﬁne-structure transitions was ap-
plied. This was done similarly to our earlier work with
Rb [1]. The highest signal amplitudes (for the range of
the experimental parameters used in this work) were ob-
served for the laser frequency detuned ≈ 250 MHz to the
low-frequency side of the peak of the D1 resonance.

FIG. 5: Nested Faraday rotation feature for D1 signal at
a light power of 115 µW. The origin of the narrow central
feature is interaction of the light with the hyperﬁne transi-
tions that are further away in frequency from where the laser
is tuned than the transitions contributing to the larger and
broader feature. These further-away transitions experience
less power broadening. The sign of an FM NMOR feature
is determined by several factors, including laser tuning with
respect to a resonance, hyperﬁne structure of the transitions,
and the sign of the ground-state g-factor (opposite for the two
ground-state hyperﬁne components).

Based on unsaturated resonance atomic absorption, in
these measurement, the atomic density was estimated as
8 · 109 cm−3.

Radio-frequency transitions between hyperﬁne states
of potassium were driven using an HP8647A signal gen-
erator. The output of the generator was connected via
coaxial cable with a 9-mm diameter wire loop terminat-
ing a coaxial cable, inserted inside the innermost mag-
netic shielding next to the vapor cell. The signal genera-
tor was referenced to the 10 MHz signal from a commer-
cial wireless-network-referenced atomic clock (Symmet-
ricom TS2700); the frequency of the generator’s output
was monitored with a Stanford Research Systems SR620
frequency counter also referenced to the TS2700 clock.
The consistency of the frequency set by the generator
and the reading from the frequency counter was better
than 0.1 Hz. Scans over the hyperﬁne transition were
performed by sweeping with 1-Hz steps the sine-wave fre-
quency generated by the synthesizer in the vicinity of the
free-space separation of the ground-state hyperﬁne com-
ponents of 39K: 461,719,720.1 Hz [16].

The hyperﬁne-transition spectra were measured at
ﬁxed tuning of the laser frequency and the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld of ≈ 1.4 mG, which was found to be suf-
ﬁcient to distinguish and separate the 0-0 transition (an
example of the recorded spectrum showing resolved Zee-
man components is shown in Fig. 6).

Data were taken for a range of light and rf powers.
Averaging over ≈ 50 − 200 scans was necessary because
of weak amplitudes of rf resonances at low powers. The
duration of a single scan was ≈ 1/2 min dominated by
the settling time of the rf frequency synthesizer (0.2 s).

FIG. 6: An example of the rf-spectrum recording showing

sition in a mG-sized ﬁeld. The central peak corresponds to
the 0-0 clock transition. Light power: 30 µW; rf power: 500
units used in Fig. 10, and the resonances are strongly power
broadened.

An example of an experimental scan over the isolated
0-0 transition is shown in Fig. 7. In the case of K, the
wavelength of the hyperﬁne-structure transition λ ≈ 65
cm is signiﬁcantly larger than the vapor cell, meaning
that the system is in the Dicke-narrowing regime, and
there is no Doppler pedestal in the resonance spectra.
Hyperﬁne frequency shifts and relaxation rate were found
from the low-light and low-rf-power limit of the double-
resonance curves. We ﬁt data for a given rf and light
power with a Lorentz proﬁle and extract the width and
the central frequency of the resonance. The linewidths
dependence on the rf and light power due to power broad-
ening, in the low-power limit, becomes linear and it is
possible to perform double extrapolation of the resonance
center and linewidths to zero power, and thus to de-
termine the intrinsic hyperﬁne-transition frequency shift
and relaxation rate for a given cell. Results of the ﬁt-
ting for each light and rf power are shown in Figs. 8
and 9. Extrapolation to zero power was ﬁrst performed
for light power [Fig. 9] and then for rf power [Fig. 10].
Within experimental uncertainties, the central position
of the resonance did not exhibit any systematic depen-
dence on the light and rf power.

Finally, based on all measurement, the shift was found
to be −9.1(2) Hz, and the intrinsic linewidth was found
to be 10.6(7) Hz.

FIG. 8: Experimental results for the shift of the frequency
of the 0-0 clock transition from its free-space value. The
plot shows all the results obtained with diﬀerent light and
rf powers; no systematic dependence on these parameters was
observed. Negative shift means that, in the paraﬃn-coated
cell, the hyperﬁne transition frequency is lower than that for
an atom in free space. Error bars represent the uncertainty
obtained from an individual ﬁt. The spread of the points ex-
ceeds what would be expected from the size of these error
bars, presumably due to slow drifts of experimental param-
eters (such as cell temperature) that may result in apparent

INTERPRETATION OF THE

HYPERFINE-TRANSITION LINEWIDTH AND
SHIFT

Here we present the analysis of the above results that
follows a similar analysis that was carried out for Rb in
Ref. [1].

The spin-exchange-relaxation contribution to the

linewidth of the hyperﬁne resonance can be estimated as
follows. For a single isotope with nuclear spin I present
in the cell, the spin-exchange contribution is given by an
equation [similar to Eq. (2)]:

γhf
SE
2π

=

R(I)nvrelσSE
π

,

where R(I) = (6I + 1)/(8I + 4) is the nuclear slow-down
factor for the 0-0 transition. With the temperature and
density used in the present experiment, one calculates:

in Refs. [1, 3]. In this experiment, this contribution may
have been more pronounced for the hyperﬁne transitions
because they were measured at higher potassium vapor
density. In future work this eﬀect could be explored more
deﬁnitively by performing Zeeman and hyperﬁne relax-
ation measurements concurrently, and as a function of
the potassium vapor density. It would also be interest-
ing to measure the rate of longitudinal (T1) relaxation
on the 0-0 transition to which adiabatic collisions do not
contribute.

The relaxation rate due to exchange of atoms with the
stem must be consistent with that for the case of NMOR.
With the adopted deﬁnitions of γN MOR, and γhf , we
estimate (again, with a large uncertainty):

Adiabatic wall collisions are the most “gentle” colli-
sions of alkali atoms with the wall coating. They do not
result in population transfer or Zeeman decoherence, but
they introduce a phase-shift φ between hyperﬁne states.
The phase-shift acquired by the atoms have a statistical
character, which leads to a shift of the resonance and
contributes to its width:

where tc = 4R/3¯υ is the characteristic time between wall
collisions, R is the cell radius and ¯υ is the average speed
of atoms. The average phase-shift φ can be determined
from the fact that the resonance frequency shift is δν =
φ/(2πtc). This yields

φ ≈ 2.8 · 10−3,

(8)

which is in the range that may be expected from the
phase shifts observed with the two Rb isotopes and Cs
[1, 14] and references therein) if one assumes
(see Refs.
linear scaling of the phase shift with the hyperﬁne in-
terval. (The phase shift is also a strong function of the
surface binding energy. The observed phase-shift scaling
suggests that the surface binding energies are comparable
for Rb, Cs, and K.)

The contribution to the hyperﬁne transition linewidth

calculated on this basis is:

VII. CONCLUSION

We have studied nonlinear magneto-optical rotation
and Zeeman relaxation rates of potassium contained in
a 3-cm-diameter paraﬃn-coated cell. The magnitude of
the nonlinear rotation due to atomic alignment is signiﬁ-
cantly suppressed in K compared to Rb and Cs owing to
the small upper-state hyperﬁne-structure intervals. The
fact that the ground-state hyperﬁne separation is com-
parable to the Doppler width leads to the appearance of
a peculiar nested feature observed in the magnetic-ﬁeld
dependence of the optical rotation at relatively high light
powers. The measured intrinsic ground-state relaxation
rate of about 2 Hz is consistent with estimated relax-
ation due to spin-exchange collisions and the exchange
of atoms between the volume of the vapor cell and the
stem. This is evidence of the high quality of the coat-
ing and a direct illustration of the remarkable properties
of paraﬃn as the coating material [17, 18]:
it takes on
the order of 104 collisions of a polarized atom with the
paraﬃn-coated wall to induce relaxation. We have also
measured the frequency shift and linewidth of the hyper-
ﬁne 0-0 clock transition. The measured frequency shift
in 39K is smaller than that in Rb and Cs, approximately
in proportion to the transition frequency. This indicates
that the contribution of the adiabatic collisions to the
hyperﬁne-transition linewidth is very small [Eq.
(9)].
This supports the idea that if adiabatic relaxation was
the dominant relaxation mechanism, it would be beneﬁ-
cial to use potassium (rather than the higher transition
frequency alkalis such as 87Rb and Cs) for secondary fre-
quency references in coated cells. Unfortunately, addi-
tional relaxation mechanisms exist (as seen in the present
measurement), which largely remove the possible advan-
tages.

VIII. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Summing the contributions from Eqs. (6),(5), and (9),
we can account for about 4 − 5 Hz out of the total ob-
served hyperﬁne-transition width of 10.6(7) Hz.

A possible additional contribution to relaxation could
be coming from alkali-vapor density dependent spin-
randomization wall collisions, as discussed for Rb and Cs

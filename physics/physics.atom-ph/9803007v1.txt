The value of adjustable parameter C and the four-parameter potential

has been expressed in terms of molecular pa-

rameters and its signiﬁcance has been brought out. The potential so con-

structed, with C derived from the molecular parameters, has been applied

to ten electronic states in addition to the states studied by Wei Hua. Aver-

age mean deviation has been found to be 3.47 as compared to 6.93, 6.95 and

9.72 obtained from Levine2, Varshni and Morse potentials, respectively. Also

Dunham’s method has been used to express rotation-vibration interaction

constant (αe) and anharmonocity constant (ωexe) in terms of C and other

molecular constants. These relations have been employed to determine these

quantities for 37 electronic states. For αe, the average mean deviation is 7.2%

compared to 19.7% for Lippincott’s potential which is known to be the best to

predict the values. Average mean deviation for (ωexe) turns out to be 17.4%

I. INTRODUCTION

A knowledge of exact potential function which governs the interaction between atoms

as a function of internuclear distance, is of fundamental importance in a wide variety of

ﬁelds ranging from gas kinetics to stellar structure. Besides, potential energy (PE) curves

provide a good deal of information about the molecular structure. Accordingly, a number of

methods have been developed to obtain these curves and the most satisfactory technique for

this purpose is RKR method [1–3], which is based on the experimental spectroscopic data.

This approach is, however, limited to the region for which the spectroscopic data exist. To

overcome this limitation, one resorts to either Dunham method or to analytical functions.

In the former, term values are expressed as:

T =

Yi,j(v +

)iJ j(J + 1)j,

1
2

Xi,j

(1)

where v and J are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively, and the co-

eﬃcients Yi,j are related to spectroscopic constants. The formulation of analytical functions

is based on the assumption that bonding potential curves can be ﬁtted to a certain form of

algebraic expression. A comparative study of the empirical potential functions by Steele et

al [4] and by Varshni [5] revealed that of all the three-parameter potential functions those

suggested by Morse [7], Varshni [5] and Levine [8] have small average absolute deviation from

the RKR curve with their respective values as 3.68%, 2.31% and 1.98%. The corresponding

Schrodinger equation can, however, be exactly solved only for Morse function.

Some time back Wei Hua [9], introduced a four-parameter (FP) potential function which

apart from the usual three parameters viz. ωe, re, De, contains a fourth parameter, b, which

in turn, depends on an adjustable constant C. The value of C was chosen to minimize

the absolute deviation of the calculated values from the corresponding RKR - values. Wei

Hua studied 15 electronic states and found that FP curves ﬁt the RKR curves more closely

2

compared to Morse curves. Moreover, the corresponding Schrodinger equation can be solved

exactly for zero and approximately for non-zero total angular momentum [9]. Almost all the

researchers who have put forward an empirical potential function including the FP potential

or have performed the comparative studies, have conﬁned themselves to the study of simple

molecules H2, O2, N2, CO, NO, hydrogen and alkali halides or to alkali oxides. With a view

to test the applicability of FP potential to a wider range of molecules, Morsagh [10] carried

out their comparative study for diatomic molecules containing sulphur. It was found that for

outer wall of the potential curve (r > re) the average mean absolute deviations from RKR

curve for Morse, Varshni, Levine and four-parameter potentials are 1.34%, 2.09%, 2.67% and

0.7%, respectively. Encouraged by the results in respect of FP potential, we have now dwelt

upon the signiﬁcance of adjustable constant C and have assessed how faithfully the potential

function predicts the values of molecular parameters αe and ωexe. This communication is

an outcome of these eﬀorts.

been taken from the literature and the references are given in tables 1 and 3.

Accuracy of a potential function can be judged in two ways: ﬁrst by its comparison with

the curve obtained from the experimental data and second, by using it to evaluate unused

constants and comparing these with the respective experimental values.

In the reported

work the ﬁndings have been subjected to both the tests.

III. POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS FOR COMPARATIVE STUDY

In the present work we have considered only those potential functions for comparative

study, which ﬁt more closely to the RKR potential curve [4]. The expressions for these

potential functions and parameters αe and ωexe are as following:

In order to obtain an analytical expression for C, we have compared FP potential with

ﬁve-parameter potential function of Hulburt and Hirschfelder [11] because a potential func-

C has been denoted as Crel to distinguish it from the C, obtained by minimum deviation

method adopted by Wei Hua.

The values of Crel have been computed for the electronic states studied by Wei Hua using

the data listed in Table 1 and are compared with C (columns 3 and 4 in Table 2). Value of

Crel depends on Be, αe and ωexe, apart from other parameters viz. ωe, re and De, that are

used in almost all the three-parameter potential functions. In other words, the value of Crel

also depends on the rotational constants. Furthermore, it is observed that a small change

in αe changes Crel signiﬁcantly while a similar change in other parameters produces small

variation. For example, in case of Li2, if we change the value of either αe or ωexe, then

resulting variation in the value of Crel due to the latter is nearly one-third that due to the

former. Thus, Crel is more sensitive to the rotation-vibration interaction constant compared

to other parameters involved in the relation. Using the equation (18), values of Crel for the

electronic states studied by Wei Hua, have been calculated and this, in turn, has been used

to calculate the FP potential curve.

(20)

where j denotes four-parameter (FP), Morse (M), Levine (L), Varshni (V) potential func-

tions, have been calculated for all the cases. The results are projected in Table 2. It has

been found that the mean square deviations with Crel are not far oﬀ from the corresponding

values derived with C which makes us to have faith in their correctness. In view of this,

6

Crel has been employed to calculate the potential curve for additional ten electronic states

(Table 3) and deduce the values of αe and ωexe for a total of 37 electronic states of various

molecules including the ones studied by Wei Hua.

IV. DERIVATION OF αE AND ωEXE

On the basis of wave mechanics Dunham [12] has shown that molecular parameters can

be expressed in terms of the derivatives of potential functions if it can be expanded in the

form of a power series. Applying this method, we get

obtained from Lippincott’s potential function [4].

Values of these two parameters have been calculated for 37 electronic states and are given

in Tables 4 and 5 for αe and ωexe, respectively. These Tables also include the corresponding

experimental values and the values found by employing Morse (eqn. 7), Varshni (eqn. 9)

and Lippincott’s (eqns. 23, 26) potential functions. Values of molecular constants used in

these calculations are listed in Table 1.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The adjusTable constant C is determined by ﬁnding the mean square deviation of the

FP potential from the RKR potential curve, which itself is calculated using the molec-

ular parameters ωe, ωexe, αe, re and Be of the individual energy levels [1–3]. Thus, any

variation in the parameters from level to level is taken care of and hence most of the vari-

ations are absorbed indirectly. On the other hand, the least square ﬁtted values of the

parameters are used in the expression for Crel. These values of parameters, therefore, do

not take care of level to level variations.

Inspite of this Crel is quite close to the value

of C calculated by minimum deviation method. Among the electronic states which were

studied by Wei Hua [9] the values of Crel are within ±6% of the values of the C except

for Li2X1Σ+3

g , H2X1Σ+

g , COX1Σ+

g andXeOd1Σ+ where the deviations are, respectively, 11%,

15.9%, 24% and 24%. These deviations can be understood from the fact that the molecular

constants vary in going to higher energy levels. In Li2, v = 0 to 4 and v > 10 levels have αe

values 0.00704 and 0.0077, respectively (corresponding γe values are also diﬀerent). In the

case of those electronic states for which complete and accurate data are available, Crel is

very close to C; the diﬀerences may be attributed to the fact that in Crel, ﬁner interactions

are not included.

The mean square deviations of the FP potential with C (i.e.

∆YF P C) and

Crel(i.e.∆YF P Crel) from RKR potential curve have been compared in Table 2. The mean

8

square deviations are within ±5% except for those states for which Crel departs signiﬁcantly

A stringent condition for the acceptance of a potential function is the exact solution of

the corresponding Schrodinger wave equation. As discussed by Wei Hua [9], FP potential

(28)

The mean square deviation of the energy values (Ecal) with C(∆EC) and Crel(∆ECrel) from

the observed levels (Eobs i.e. URKR values) have been calculated using the above equation and

are given in the last two columns of Table 2. Corresponding ∆EC and ∆ECrel are very close

to each other supporting that Crel equals C within the accuracy of molecular parameters

and can be computed from these (eqn. 18). To reinforce the above conclusions, the mean

square deviations viz. ∆Yj and ∆ECrel from the RKR potential have been compared for

additional ten states using Crel in the FP potential function and the results are compiled in

Table 3.

Taking Crel as the correct value of C parameters, αe and ωexe have been calculated using

equation 21 and equation 22, for 37 electronic states including those studied by Wei Hua.

The FP potential with Crel yields αe values within ±15% of the corresponding experimental

values. The observed variation is a consequence of uncertainty in the values of the molecular

parameters which, in turn, determine the accuracy of Crel. It may, however, be pointed out

that the results are closer to the experimental values as compared to the ones obtained

from Lippincott’s potential function (eqn. 24) which is claimed to be the best potential

for predicting the αe values [4]. The average mean deviations for FP, Morse, Varshni and

9

Lippincott’s potentials are 7.2%, 27.6%, 18.7% and 19.7%, respectively, establishing the

supremacy of FP potential over other three-parameter potentials in predicting the αe values.

As regards ωexe the average mean deviations have been found to be 17.4%, 26.9%,

15.5% and 13.9%, respectively for FP, Morse, Varshni and Lippincott’s potential functions.

Obviously, the accuracy is not as good as for αe. This is perhaps because Crel itself is not as

much sensitive to ωexe. However, the results are better than the Morse potential for which,

unlike the Varshni and Lippincott’s potential functions, Schrodinger equation is solvable.

The calculated values are slightly larger than the experimental values for almost all the

molecules. A graph between Crel for the individual level and rmax (corresponding to v) (ﬁg.

1) reveals that C increases almost exponentially to large negative values at higher v. The

nature of the curve at large v and the fact that the factor (1 + C + C 2) may be approximated

to eC(= 1 + C + C2

2 ) because |C| < 1, have prompted us to write ωexe in the light of equation

22, as

ωexe =

h
8π2cµ

a2eC

(29)

The use of this relation reduces the average mean deviation to 15.9% (column 12 in Table

5) which is comparable to the value obtained from Lippincott’s potential function.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The constant C has been expressed in terms of molecular constants implying that the

FP potential manifests the contribution of vibration, rotation, rotation-vibration interaction

constants. Furthermore, the potential may be preferred over all the known three-parameter

potentials for the prediction of the rotation-vibration interaction constant, αe and it yields

the value of ωexe as good as provided by Lippincott’s function which is known to be the

best analytical function for its prediction.

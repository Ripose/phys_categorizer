We report on calculations of the elastic cross section and thermalization rate for collision between
two maximally spin-polarized chromium atoms in the cold and ultracold regimes, relevant to buﬀer-
gas and magneto-optical cooling of chromium atoms. We calculate ab initio potential energy curves
for Cr2 and the van der Waals coeﬃcient C6, and construct interaction potentials between two
colliding Cr atoms. We explore the eﬀect of shape resonances on elastic cross section, and ﬁnd that
they dramatically aﬀect the thermalization rate. Our calculated value for the s-wave scattering
length is compared in magnitude with a recent measurement at ultracold temperatures.

Collisions of atoms at ultracold temperatures have re-
ceived considerable attention because of their importance
in cooling and trapping of atoms [1] and their role in high
precision spectroscopy [2] and Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion [3]. Processes occurring in the cold regime are sen-
sitive to the details of the interaction potentials between
the colliding systems over an extended range of inter-
nuclear separations. Recent experiments with chromium
[4, 5, 6, 7] emphasize the need for theoretical studies of
Cr scattering properties. The interest in cooling Cr stems
from its particular properties; in its ground state 7S3, it
possesses a very large magnetic moment, 6 µB (µB: Bohr
magneton), making it an ideal atom for buﬀer-cooling in
a purely magnetic trap [7], as well as for magneto-optical
trapping [4]. In addition, anisotropic long-range interac-
tions, such as chromium’s magnetic dipole-dipole inter-
actions, may lead to novel phenomena in BECs [9, 10].
The existence of a stable fermionic isotope, 53Cr, opens
the possibility of obtaining fermionic degenerate gas us-
ing sympathetic cooling. Chromium was also used in a
new cooling scheme [5], where ultracold chromium atoms
were loaded from a MOT into an Ioﬀe-Pritchard mag-
netic trap, and cooled below 100µK. However, a not
so-desirable byproduct of large-spin collision is inelastic
“bad” scattering rates that deplete the trap.

On the theoretical front, the electronic spectrum of
the Cr2 dimer poses a considerable numerical challenge.
Chromium is the ﬁrst atom in the periodic table with a
half-ﬁlled d shell (the ground electronic conﬁguration is
Cr(3d54s,7 S)) and the Cr2 dimer is one of the most ex-
treme cases of multiple metal-metal bonding. To date,
the best attempt to calculate its interaction potential
curves is a multiconﬁguration second-order perturbation
theory with complete active space self-consistent ﬁeld
(CASSCF/CASPT2) [11, 12]. While some information
on the spectroscopy of the ground electronic state (1Σ+
g
molecular symmetry) exists, there is no data available for
the interaction of two maximally spin-stretched Cr atoms
in the 13Σ+
g molecular symmetry, i.e. total spin, S = 6.
In this communication, we explore the collisional prop-
erties of Cr atoms in the cold and ultracold tempera-
ture regimes by revisiting the electronic structure of the
dimer. More accurate Born-Oppenheimer potential en-

ergy curves dissociating to two ground Cr atoms were
obtained. The van der Waals interaction coeﬃcient,
C6, was obtained semi-empirically from available bound
atomic transition matrix elements and photoionization
cross sections to be C6 = 745 ± 55 a.u., where 1 a.u. =
9.57 × 10−80 Jm6. The elastic cross section and colli-
sion rate coeﬃcient were calculated using the newly con-
structed potential curves and compared against two re-
cent measurements of elastic rate coeﬃcients [5, 7]. We
also investigated the bound and resonance structure in
the 13Σ+
g potential energy curve and determined the res-
onance positions and widths as a function of rotational
angular momenta.

The potential curves for Cr2, shown in Fig. 1, were
constructed from three regions joined smoothly together.
We ﬁrst computed ab initio potential curves using the
CASSCF/CASPT2 method [11, 12]. The CASSCF wave
function is formed by distributing 12 electrons in the
3d and 4s derived active orbitals while keeping the in-
active 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p derived orbitals occupied.
The remaining dynamical electron correlation energy
is obtained through second order perturbation theory
(CASPT2). The basis set used in the calculations is of
the atomic natural orbital (ANO-RCC) type contracted
to 9s8p7d5f 3g. This basis set is relativistic and includes
functions for correlating the 3s and 3p electrons [13]. The
Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian was used with Fock-type cor-
rection 0.5 ∗ g1, see [14]. The full counterpoise method
was used to correct energies for the basis set superpo-
sition error (BSSE). Convergence to 10−10, in hartrees,
was achieved, and numerical accuracy in computed bind-
ing energies was about 10−8.
For separations R ≤ Rλ

1 is the smallest sepa-
ration of the ab initio data for the potential energy Vλ(R),
each curve was joined smoothly to the exponential form
Vλ(R) = cλ exp(−bλR), with the coeﬃcients cλ and bλ
determined by matching both the potential curve and its
ﬁrst derivative continuously at Rλ
1 . At large values of R,
the ab initio data were matched to the asymptotic form

α0 = 85.00 a.u., in agreement with a recommended value

Using these potential curves, we computed the elastic

lar state, i. e. the 13Σ+
g state. [Results for other molec-
ular states and also inelastic and spin relaxation cross
sections will be provided in a future publication.] The

The cross section as a function of the collision energy
is shown in Fig. 2 for three diﬀerent 13Σ+
g interaction po-
tentials; each constructed by matching at large distances
to the upper, lower, and mean values of C6. Note that
at collision energies larger than E ∼ 10−6 a.u., aside
from the shape resonance structure, the cross sections
diﬀer little in magnitude, but are dramatically diﬀerent
in the s-wave limit. We ﬁnd the scattering length for
the 13Σ+
g state, a13, to be large and negative (see Ta-
ble I), indicating that evaporative cooling should be eﬃ-
cient, but that a Bose-Einstein condensate of 52Cr would
not be stable for large number of atoms. This contrasts

FIG. 2:
Elastic cross sections for collision between two
bosonic Cr atoms as a function of energy in the cold and
ultracold regimes. The three curves are labeled by the value
of the C6 coeﬃcient used to construct the interaction poten-
tial in each case. See text for details. The inﬂuence of shape
resonances is dramatic.

length, obtained from a ﬁt to the experimental collision
rate coeﬃcient, Fig. 3, agrees in magnitude with our up-
per bound calculated value, but diﬀers in the prediction
of the sign (see also the discussion of the rates below).
Our calculated eﬀective range expansion coeﬃcients also
agree very closely with the results obtained using the
quantum-defect method of Gao [23].

As the collision energy increases, the appearance of
shape resonances can lead to enormously large cross sec-
tions. Althougth the details of the resonance structure,
i. e. proﬁle and energy position, depend on the details
of the potentials, the overall eﬀect on the collisional rate
coeﬃcient is only minimal at temperatures for which the
shape resonances matter. This is portrayed in Fig. 3
for the ultracold and cold temperatures. The rate coef-
ﬁcients for the three diﬀerent potentials are similar for
temperatures higher than 100 mK. Our rate coeﬃcients
are larger than those measured by [7] by more than an
order of magnitude. We do not yet understand the origin
of this discrepancy- an attempt at modifying the poten-
tial in the long-range and in the short-range resulted in
practically similar results. The shape and magnitude of
the calculated rate coeﬃcient for C6 = 800 a.u. agrees
well in both magnitude and shape with the MOT exper-
imental results, see Fig. 3 of Ref.
[5]. The decline in
the rate coeﬃcient for T > 100 µK, as seen in our cal-
culation, followed by a rise for T > 1 mK, is due to the
appearance of the l = 4 shape resonance in Fig. 2. The
experimental determination of the dip in the elastic rate
could be used to infer a more accurate value of C6 and
hence the scattering length as well.

In Fig. 4, we give the bound and shape resonance
structure in the 13Σ+
g potential energy curve with C6 =
745 a.u., as a function of the rotational angular momen-

tum, l. Due to symmetry, only even values of l appear
in the collision. There are 30 bound vibrational levels
for the l = 0 partial wave. The grouping of the levels
in solid and dashed lines indicates the appearance of an
additional shape resonance. Table II gives our calculated
position and width for a number of rotational shape reso-
nances. The narrowest resonance is for the l = 19 partial
wave with a lifetime of about two seconds. This reso-
nance, however, is not populated in a bosonic collision.

A plateau in the observed elastic collision rate coeﬃ-
cient in the range 10 mK < T < 300 mK exists [7, 8]
and is reproduced in our calculation in Fig. 3. It appears
that this plateau is produced by the conﬂuence of many
collisionally-excited shape resonances in this temperature
range.

We have calculated ab initio interaction potentials for
collision of two Cr atoms, and obtained the long-range
van der Waals coeﬃcient for the ﬁrst time. Elastic colli-
sion cross section and rate coeﬃcient for two maximally-
stretched chromium atoms have been computed in the
cold and ultracold regimes and compared with available
experiments. The eﬀect of partial-wave shape resonances
is studied. The s-wave scattering length and eﬀective
range have been obtained in accord with experiment.
The disagreement with the buﬀer-gas cooling rate coeﬃ-
cient results is not fully understood and the inelastic loss
rate will be studied in the near future. The main loss
rate mechanism is expected to be spin dipole interaction.

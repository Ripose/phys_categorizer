Abstract

We demonstrate a technique for directly measuring the ﬁne-structure interval

in alkali atoms using two frequency-stabilized diode lasers. Each laser has a

linewidth of order 1 MHz and precise tunability: one laser is tuned to a

hyperﬁne transition in the D1 line, and the other laser to a hyperﬁne transition

in the D2 line. The outputs of the lasers are fed into a scanning Michelson

interferometer that measures the ratio of their wavelengths accurately. To

illustrate the technique, we measure the ﬁne-structure interval in Rb, and

obtain a value of 237.6000(3)(5) cm−1 for the hyperﬁne-free 5P3/2

− 5P1/2

interval.

The advent of semiconductor diode lasers has revolutionized atomic physics and partic-

ularly the ﬁeld of laser spectroscopy [1]. Single-mode laser diodes with cw output powers of

few 10s of mW are now available at very low cost. By placing the diodes in an external cavity

and using optical feedback from an angle-tuned grating [2], they can be made to operate at

single frequency (single longitudinal mode) with linewidths of order 1 MHz and tunability

over several nm. This has increased the access of researchers to atomic physics experiments

which have earlier required expensive ring-cavity dye or Ti-sapphire lasers. For example,

the ﬁeld of laser cooling [3] has blossomed in the past decade as several alkali atoms and

alkali-like ions have cooling transitions in the infrared which are accessible with stabilized

diode lasers. The main advantages of diode lasers are in terms of their tunability and nar-

row spectral width. In addition, techniques such as saturated-absorption spectroscopy using

counter-propagating pump and probe beams to eliminate the ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect can

help resolve narrow hyperﬁne transitions within a given atomic line. It is thus possible to

get an absolute frequency calibration of the laser by locking to such a transition.

In this letter, we show that this well-established capability of diode lasers can be used

in an important application: to make precise measurements of ﬁne-structure intervals in

alkali atoms. Knowledge of ﬁne-structure intervals is important for several reasons, e.g. in

the study of atomic collisions, astrophysical processes, and relativistic calculations of atomic

energy levels. Alkali atoms are particularly important because of their widespread use in

ultra-cold collision studies, photoassociation spectroscopy, atomic tests of parity violation,

and more recently in Bose-Einstein condensation. The species we have studied is Rb, but

the technique is more general and should prove useful in other alkali atoms (such as Li, K,

and Cs), alkali-like ions, and indeed any system where the transitions are accessible with

diode lasers. Our technique uses two diode lasers, one of which is tuned to the D1 line

and the other to the D2 line. The output of the lasers is fed into a scanning Michelson

interferometer to directly obtain their wavelength ratio. Using tabulated values [4] for the

wavelength of the D2 line, we extract the D1 − D2 splitting. The value we obtain for the 5P

state of Rb has a precision of 5 parts in 108, and can be potentially improved by another

2

order of magnitude.

The interferometer for the ratio measurement, shown schematically in Fig. 1, has been

described extensively in a previous publication [5] where we highlighted its use as a precision

wavelength meter. For consistency with the terminology there, we will call the two lasers

as “reference” and “unknown”, respectively. The basic idea is to obtain the ratio of the

two laser wavelengths using a scanning Michelson interferometer where both lasers traverse

essentially the same path. As the interferometer is scanned, the interference pattern on the

detectors goes alternately through bright and dark fringes and the ratio of the number of

fringes counted is the ratio of the two wavelengths. The ratio obtained is a wavelength ratio

in air, however, the wavelength ratio in vacuum (or equivalent frequency ratio) is easily

calculated by making a small correction for the dispersion of air [6] between the reference

wavelength and the unknown.

The ﬁne-structure measurements are done with two diode laser systems. The ﬁrst diode

laser system (or “reference” laser) is built around a commercial single-mode diode (Mit-

subishi ML60125R-01) with a nominal operating wavelength of 785 nm. The light is colli-

mated using an aspheric lens to give an elliptic beam of 5.8 mm × 1.8 mm 1/e2 diameter.

The laser is frequency stabilized in a standard external-cavity design (Littrow conﬁguration)

using optical feedback from a 1800 lines/mm diﬀraction grating mounted on a piezoelectric

transducer [2]. Using a combination of temperature and current control, the laser is tuned

close to the 780 nm D2 line in atomic Rb (5S1/2 ↔ 5P3/2 transition). A part of the output

beam is tapped for Doppler-free saturated-absorption spectroscopy in a Rb vapor cell. The

various hyperﬁne transitions (and crossover resonances) in the two common isotopes of Rb,

85Rb and 87Rb, are clearly resolved, as shown in the insets of Fig. 2. The linewidth of the

hyperﬁne peaks is 15–20 MHz; this is somewhat larger than the 6.1 MHz natural linewidth

and is primarily limited by power broadening due to the pump beam [7]. The injection

current into the laser diode is modulated slightly to obtain an error signal so that the laser

can be locked to any of the peaks in the saturated-absorption spectrum. The second diode

laser system (“unknown” laser) is identical to the ﬁrst one, except that the laser diode (SDL

3

5311-G1) has a nominal operating wavelength of 792 nm. After stabilization, it is tuned to

the 795 nm D1 line in atomic Rb (5S1/2 ↔ 5P1/2 transition). The elliptic beams from the

two lasers are fed into the Michelson interferometer. The large Rayleigh ranges (∼34 m and

∼3 m in the two directions) ensure that the beams remain collimated over the length of the

interferometer and diﬀraction eﬀects are not signiﬁcant.

For the ﬁne-structure measurements, we lock the reference laser to the 5S1/2, F = 3 ↔
5P3/2, F ′ = (3, 4) crossover resonance in 85Rb, i.e. midway between the F = 3 ↔ F ′ = 3
and the F = 3 ↔ F ′ = 4 transitions [8]. From the Rb energy-level tables [4] and measured

hyperﬁne shifts [9], this corresponds to a frequency of 3.8422958 × 1014 Hz. To get several

independent measurements of the ﬁne-structure splitting, we lock the second laser to diﬀerent

hyperﬁne transitions of the D1 line in the two isotopes of Rb. In each case, the wavelength

ratio is measured about 100 times. The values are plotted as a histogram and a Gaussian ﬁt

to the histogram yields the mean ratio and the 1σ (statistical) error in the mean. The mean

wavelength ratios obtained from four independent measurements are listed in Table I. We

extract the hyperﬁne-free ﬁne-structure interval in vacuum by making two corrections to the

measured ratio. First, we convert the wavelength ratio in air to a frequency ratio using the

refractive index of air at the two wavelengths from Edl´en’s formula [6]: n = 1.000275163 at

780 nm (D2) and n = 1.000275068 at 795 nm (D1). Then we remove the hyperﬁne frequency

shifts shown in Fig. 2, which are known to sub-MHz accuracy [9]. The extracted values of

the ﬁne-structure interval are listed in the table, from this we obtain an average value of:

237.6000(3)(5) cm−1,

with the quoted errors being statistical and systematic, respectively. Isotope shifts in the

ﬁne-structure interval are negligible at this level of precision.

The main source of statistical error is that the frequency counter counts zero crossings

and does not count fractional fringes. The total number of fringes counted depends on the

fringe rate (or cart speed) coupled with the 10 s integration time. Currently our photodiode

electronics limits the cart speed so that we can use only about 20 cm of cart travel per

4

measurement. This results in a single-shot statistical error of about 5 parts in 107 in each

data set [10]. The error of less than 5 parts in 108 in Table I comes after averaging over

∼ 100 individual measurements. Since the coherence length of the stabilized diode laser is

about 50 m, it should be possible to use at least 1 m of cart travel for each measurement

with simple improvements in the counting electronics. This should help in reducing the

statistical error in future to below 1 MHz.

There are several potential sources of systematic error, the main two being variation in the

lock point of the lasers and non-parallelism of the two laser beams in the interferometer. We

have checked for the ﬁrst error by measuring the ﬁne-structure interval with the unknown

laser on diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions of the D1 line. As seen from Table I, within the

errors quoted, the diﬀerent ratios yield consistent values for the hyperﬁne-free ﬁne-structure

interval. This implies that there is no signiﬁcant variation in the lock point of the lasers. The

second source of systematic error, namely that the two beams have a small angle between

them, is more serious. Any misalignment would cause a systematic increase in the measured

ratio given by 1/ cos θ, where θ is the angle between the beams. We have tried to minimize

this error in two ways. The ﬁrst method is to use the unused output beam of the reference

laser (the one on the same side of the beamsplitter as the input beam) as a tracer for aligning

the unknown laser beam, and checking for parallelism over a distance of about 2 m [11]. The

second method is to check for parallelism by looking for a minimum in the measured ratio as

the angle of the unknown beam is varied. This works because the measured value is always

larger than the correct value, whether θ is positive or negative, and becomes minimum when

θ = 0.

To get an estimate of the systematic error using these methods of alignment, we have

measured the frequency ratio of two identical stabilized diode lasers locked to diﬀerent

hyperﬁne transitions in the D2 line of 85Rb [12], as described in our earlier work [5]. The

frequency diﬀerence is known to be 2944 MHz, while the measurements yield a mean value

of 2932(16) MHz. This shows that the systematic error is below 16 MHz or about 0.0005

cm−1.

In future, this error can also be brought down to the sub-MHz level by carefully

5

checking for parallelism over longer distances.

The value for the 5P ﬁne-structure interval we obtain can be compared to the value

listed in the Rb energy-level tables published by NIST [4]: 237.60 cm−1. Our result is

consistent with this value but has signiﬁcantly higher accuracy. The NIST value is obtained

by ﬁtting the energy levels to all available spectroscopic data. The accuracy of 0.01 cm−1

for this value is typical for most alkali atoms and our technique has the potential to improve

this by two orders of magnitude. In general, ﬁne-structure intervals are known very poorly

compared to hyperﬁne shifts. This is because hyperﬁne shifts, which are of order GHz,

are more accessible to techniques such as microwave resonance or heterodyne measurements

[13], while ﬁne-structure splittings are of order THz and cannot be measured very easily. It

is in this range of frequency diﬀerences that our technique is uniquely suitable. Finally, we

mention that the scanning interferometer can also be used as a precision wavelength meter,

giving the unknown wavelength in terms of the reference [5]. This could be important,

for example, in laser cooling of ions where it is necessary to set the laser frequency with

∼MHz precision but not always possible to ﬁnd transitions to which the cooling laser can

be locked. Recently, the absolute frequency of a diode laser stabilized on the Rb D2 line

has been measured with sub-MHz accuracy [13]. Our wavelength meter can thus act as a

secondary reference to improve the absolute precision of energy-level tables.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a technique to directly measure the ﬁne-structure

interval in alkali atoms. Our method uses two stabilized diode lasers, one locked to the D1

line and the other to the D2 line, and a scanning Michelson interferometer to obtain their

wavelength ratio. As an illustration of the power of this technique, we measure the interval

in the 5P state of Rb to be 237.6000(3)(5) cm−1, or 7 123 069(9)(15) MHz. The method is

easily extendable to other systems in which transitions are accessible with diode lasers. In

addition, the interferometer with a diode laser locked to an atomic transition can be used

as a precision wavelength meter for tunable lasers [5] since the atomic transition acts as a

convenient calibrated wavelength marker.

both beams traverse exactly the same path, albeit in opposite directions. However, this

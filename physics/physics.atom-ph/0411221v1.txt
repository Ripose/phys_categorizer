approximation and tunneling theory including nuclear motion

We present a detailed comparison of strong-ﬁeld ionization of diatomic molecules and their com-
panion atoms with nearly equal ionization potentials. We perform calculations in the length and
velocity gauge formulations of the molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation and with the molecular
tunneling theory, and in both cases we consider eﬀects of nuclear motion. A comparison of our
results with experimental data shows that the length gauge strong-ﬁeld approximation gives the
most reliable predictions.

INTRODUCTION

When a molecule is subject to an intense laser ﬁeld,
a series of related strong-ﬁeld processes may occur, in-
cluding ionization, dissociation and high-harmonic gen-
eration. As for atoms, it is essential to obtain a detailed
understanding of the initial, single-ionization process in
order to describe the subsequent evolution of the system.
Fully ab initio calculations of the strong-ﬁeld ionization
of any molecule more complicated than H2 are impossi-
ble in the foreseeable future. Hence, theories of general
practical use have to rely on theoretical modelling and
it is the purpose of the present work to investigate the
accuracy of such models. While the quality of ab ini-
tio calculations may be checked numerically by studies of
convergence and by identity of results in diﬀerent gauges,
the quality of an approximate model has to be checked
against a more accurate model or experimental data.

In the study of strong-ﬁeld ionization of molecules,
three models are widely used. These are the velocity
gauge (VG) molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation (MO-
SFA VG) [1], the length gauge (LG) MO-SFA (MO-SFA
LG) [2], and the molecular tunneling theory [3]. The
latter theory is an extension of the atomic Ammosov-
Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling theory [4] generalized
to take into account the non-spherical symmetry of the
molecular system and it is referred to as the MO-ADK
theory. The MO-SFA VG and MO-SFA LG theories
are the velocity gauge and length gauge versions of the
Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR) atomic theories [5, 6, 7] ap-
propriately modiﬁed to the molecular case. In short, the
MO-SFA theories are based on an S -matrix formulation
where one considers the transition from a ﬁeld-free ini-
tial state to a Volkov ﬁnal state, i.e., the state of a free
electron in the laser ﬁeld.

To assess the quality of the models, predictions have
been compared with experimental data (see, e.g., Ref. [3]
and references therein).
In particular, data has been
studied in detail which compares ionization yields of di-
atomic molecules with yields of atoms having nearly the
same electronic binding as the molecules – the so-called
companion atoms. The ratio of ion signal data of di-
atomic molecules and their companion atoms [8, 9, 10,

11, 12, 13] is illuminating since eﬀects are factored out
which depend only on the binding energy. Hence a com-
parison of the ratio of ionization signal of, e.g., N2 and
its companion Ar atom allows one to study fairly directly
eﬀects of molecular symmetry and ro-vibrational motion.
In Ref. [3] the status of theory versus experiments was
discussed: The MO-ADK theory [3] gave results in sat-
isfactory agreement with experiments for molecules with
suppressed ionization: D2:Ar [10, 13], O2:Xe [8, 11] and
without: N2:Ar [11].

For the F2:Ar ratio, the MO-ADK theory predicts sup-
pression of the molecular signal while the experimental
data [12] does not. For the F2 molecule, however, the
total energy obtained from a Hartree-Fock (HF) calcula-
tion of the molecular system is higher than the energy of
the separated atoms [14]. This means that electron cor-
relation eﬀects are important for the proper description
of the binding of F2, and, accordingly, the one-electron
model taken as the starting point for the MO-ADK (and
the MO-SFA) theory, is not applicable. The models dis-
cussed above, and in the present paper, can only be
meaningfully applied on molecular systems where eﬀects
of electron-electron correlation are small [15]. Methods
which do take electron-electron correlation into account
are presently under development [16, 17] but these meth-
ods are not yet applicable to molecules interacting with
oscillating ﬁelds in geometries without cylindrical sym-
metry.

The MO-SFA VG was compared with experiments in
Ref. [1]. The theory was shown to predict suppressed
ionization of O2:Xe [8, 11] and to predict ‘absence’ of
suppressed ionization in N2:Ar [11].
In Ref. [18], the
predictions of the MO-SFA VG were compared with ex-
perimental above-threshold-ionization spectra of O2 (πg
symmetry) and N2 (σg symmetry) and for these systems
the theory gave the correct qualitative predictions.

In general, the MO-SFA VG approximation predicts
suppressed ionization for diatomic molecules with an an-
tibonding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and it predicts no suppression of the ionization of di-
atoms with a bonding HOMO. These general predictions
are based on an analysis of the MO-SFA VG rate in terms
of linear combinations of atomic orbitals where the an-

tibonding [bonding] rate is proportional to sin2 (q
R/2)
cos2 (q
1 where q is the momentum
R
of the outgoing electron and R the internuclear coordi-
(cid:2)
nate. For example, the MO-SFA VG approximation pre-
dicts suppressed ionization for O2 with a HOMO of πg
symmetry and no suppression of the D2:Ar signal. This
latter prediction is in contrast with experimental obser-
vation [13] and MO-ADK theory [3], and we shall return
to this discrepancy below.

In view of the above discussion at least two questions
need to be investigated in more detail. Firstly, what is
the quantitative prediction of the MO-SFA in the D2:Ar
case? Secondly, is it possible to carry out a calcula-
tion in a more accurate approximation which sheds some
light on the discrepancy between the MO-ADK calcula-
tions of Ref. [3] and the experimental results of Ref. [13]?
To address related questions we have recently developed
the necessary tools for computations in the velocity and
length gauge formulations of the MO-SFA, and in addi-
tion we have set up a programme for the evaluation of
the molecular tunneling theory [2, 15]. Our LG and VG
versions of the MO-SFA are generalizations of the atomic
adiabatic theory [19]. Our formulation of the MO-ADK
theory follows Ref. [3], but our method of extracting the
angular coeﬃcients of relevance for the evaluation of the
rate is diﬀerent [2, 15]. In this work, we extend our previ-
ous analysis, by taking eﬀects of nuclear motion explicitly
into account and we show that the inclusion of nuclear
vibrations may lead to a signiﬁcantly lower rate. For the
molecules considered in this paper nuclear motion is of
signiﬁcant importance for D2 and NO while it leads to
small eﬀects in the ﬁnal results for the other molecules
studied.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we de-
scribe the theories and provide a qualitative discussion of
the eﬀects of nuclear motion. In Sec. III, we give some
calculational details, in Sec. IV we present the results of
our calculations, and in Sec. V, we conclude.

II. THEORY

In this section we describe the MO-SFA and MO-ADK
theories and discuss how to account for eﬀects of nu-
clear motion. In the MO-SFA one considers a state to
state transition where the molecular states are generated
from moving nuclei. Contrary, in the MO-ADK there is
no detailed speciﬁcation of the ﬁnal state in the strong-
ﬁeld ionization process, and in order to maintain a qua-
sistatic tunneling picture one must ﬁx the nuclei at an
internuclear distance R and let the electron move in the
R-dependent potential.

A. Molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation including
nuclear motion in the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation

In the Coulomb gauge and in the dipole approximation
the linearly polarized laser ﬁeld may be described by the
vector potential A(t) = A0 cos ωt, where ω is the angular
frequency. The corresponding electric ﬁeld is obtained as
F (t) =
∂tA(t), i.e., F (t) = F0 sin ωt. The interaction
between the ﬁeld and an N -electron system is [atomic
units (~ = me = e = a0 = 1) are used throughout]

and
designates integration over both the electronic
and nuclear coordinates. Here Ψi describes the molecular
initial state and Ψf is the ﬁnal state describing the state
of the residual ion and the free electron in the laser ﬁeld.
In Eqs. (3)-(4), n0 is the minimum number of photons
needed to reach the continuum, and the momentum qn is
given by energy conservation. In the Born-Oppenheimer
(BO) approximation qn is determined by Eq. (10) below.
In the SFA we approximate the initial state by a ﬁeld-
free molecular state. In the BO approximation this state
is a product of an electronic state and a ro-vibrational
state labelled by νi, Ji. The electronic and vibrational
states are typically the respective ground states. The
rotational periods of the diatomic molecules are much
longer than typical experimental pulse durations and
therefore the rotational degrees of freedom may be ne-
glected. The total energy of the initial state is

where χνi(R) is the initial vibrational wave function and
the ψj’s are orthogonal single-electron wave functions.
The electronic wave function is evaluated at the nuclear
equilibrium distance R0 since we assume, consistently
with the BO picture, that it will be a slowly varying
function of the internuclear distance. We have checked
that the results are insensitive to this approximation.

We seek the transition amplitude to a single-electron
Volkov state and a deﬁnite vibrational and electronic
eigenstate of the molecular ion. The application of a
Volkov wave in the ﬁnal state means that the electron-
ion interaction is neglected. Additionally, we assume that
the electronic state of the ion is unrelaxed, i.e., only the

When we compare Eqs. (14) and (15), we see that the
length gauge formulation accounts for a superimposed

ment of the momentum space wave function. Such an
eﬀect is not present in the velocity gauge amplitude.

ion, while in the length gauge C(LG)
[21]. Both correction factors were derived for the case of
strong-ﬁeld ionization of atoms, and hence do not take
into account the molecular symmetry. In our evaluation
of rates, we have found that much more precise results
are obtained in the length gauge with C(LG)
Coul = 1 [2, 15].
We explain the absense of a Coulomb interaction in the
length gauge by the fact that the transition to the contin-
uum occurs at large distances. In this spatial region the
laser-electron interaction is stronger than the electron-ion
interaction and the Volkov state is a good approximation
for the ﬁnal state. In addition to the Coulomb correction
factor, we multiply the rates by the number of equiva-
lent electrons in the HOMO. Finally, to obtain the total
ionization rate of the molecules, we must sum the con-
tributions from each vibrational level in the ﬁnal state.
In the velocity gauge our result is equivalent to that of
Ref. [22]. For the noble gas atoms with ﬁlled p shells we
sum the rates from each magnetic sub-state to obtain the
total rate of ionization.

1. Qualitative discussion of the eﬀect of nuclear motion

The transition amplitude of Eq. (12) consists of two
factors, namely the Franck-Condon (FC) factor and an
electronic matrix element and both factors depend on the
vibrational levels considered. The rates to each vibra-
tional level are therefore not just proportional to the FC
factors. Instead the relative populations in the lower ﬁnal
vibrational states are enhanced compared with the dis-
tribution obtained from the FC factors alone [22] because
the electronic matrix element is favoured by the smallest
energy diﬀerences. When including vibrations, the total
rate summed over all ﬁnal vibrational states will therefore
typically be smaller than if the vibrational ground state
of the ion had been given the weight of unity. This latter
method is nearly equivalent to ﬁxing the nuclei [compare
Eqs. (14)-(15) with Eqs. (5)-(6) of Ref. [2]].

The importance of the inclusion of nuclear vibrations
will depend on the properties of the neutral molecule
and the molecular ion. If their potential curves are only
shifted with respect to each other but otherwise exactly

4

identical then the vibrational eigenstates will be identical
too. The orthogonality of the nuclear wavefunctions then
assures that only a single FC will be nonzero. We may es-
timate the importance of nuclear vibrations using molec-
ular orbital theory and by considering the type of valence
orbitals. If the valence orbital is nearly non-bonding as,
e.g., in N2, the bonding properties of the molecular ion
will be approximately equal to the bonding properties of
neutral molecule and transitions between the vibrational
ground states of the molecule and the ion dominate. In
the case of a bonding HOMO, e.g., as in D2, the bond-
ing of the ion will be weakened and transitions to many
vibrational states will occur.

B. Molecular ADK theory

The tunneling theory [3, 4] relies on the assumption
that at any given instant of time the system will respond
to the external laser ﬁeld as if it were a static electric ﬁeld.
The rate of ionization in the oscillating ﬁeld may then be
determined by time-averaged static rates. Whether this
approach is reasonable or not depends on the value of
the Keldysh parameter γ = √2Eb
1 in
the tunneling regime. We will only show results from the
MO-ADK theory in the intensity regions corresponding
to γ

[5] with γ

The tunneling rate of diatomic molecules can be de-
termined once the ﬁeld-free asymptotic wave function is
known. In a body-ﬁxed frame, labeled by superscript B
and a z axis directed along the internuclear axis, this
function has the asymptotic Coulomb form

From the asymptotic form of Eq. (17), the total ioniza-
tion rate in a static (DC) ﬁeld in the positive laboratory-
ﬁxed Z direction is calculated as in the atomic case
[21, 23, 24], and the result is [3]

Eqs. (18) and (19) must be modiﬁed by the substitution
1)lClm [15]. We see from Eqs. (18)-(20) that
Clm →
one only needs to know the Clm coeﬃcients in order to be
able to evaluate the tunneling formula analytically. See
also Ref. [15] for a generalization of the tunneling theory
to molecules with more than two nuclei.

The tunneling theory can be extended to include eﬀects
of vibrations. In the quasistatic picture all potentials seen
by the active electron should be regarded as being static.
This means that the nuclei are ﬁxed and the height of the
tunneling barrier will depend on the internuclear distance
chosen. We then calculate the rate for each value of R
and weight these R-dependent rates by the R probability
distribution obtained from the nuclear wave function [3].
As an approximate binding energy we take the energy
diﬀerence between the potential curves of the ion and
neutral molecule as calculated by HF theory. The vibra-
tional wave functions are constructed from the harmonic
approximation to experimental potential curves [26]. As
demonstrated in Sec. IV the eﬀect of this R-dependent
weighting is quite small. Note in passing that recently
vibrational distributions were measured and calculated
with tunneling theory [27].

III. CALCULATIONAL DETAILS

aBased on photoelectron spectrum

In order to determine the angular coeﬃcients Clm we
evaluate the ground state wave function in the HF ap-
proximation. We seek an accurate description of the
orbitals at large distances with the correct exponen-
tial behaviour. For this purpose we ﬁnd in general the
usual expansion in an atomic Gaussian basis to be inad-
equate. Instead we solve the HF equations fully numer-
ically for the diatomic molecules [28] and for the atoms
[29, 30]. After having obtained the ground state orbitals
we project the highest occupied orbital on the spherical
harmonics and match the resulting radial functions to
the form ClmrZion /κ−1e−κr treating the angular coeﬃ-
cients as ﬁtting parameters. We give the Clm’s obtained
by this procedure in Table I. Since orbitals from the
HF calculation are optimal within the independent par-
ticle approximation, the HF Clm coeﬃcients should be
more accurate than the multiple scattering coeﬃcients
reported in Ref. [3].

The knowledge of the coeﬃcents Clm is suﬃcient to
evaluate the MO-SFA LG rate accurately [15]. For the
evaluation of the MO-SFA VG transition amplitudes, we
make a numeric Fourier transform of the HOMO.

p

If we use the experimental ionization potential in the
calculation of κ, the HOMO is not guaranteed to follow
the correct asymptotic form of Eq. (17). The asymp-
totic form will be similar but with κHF =
εHOMO|
|
substituted for κ with εHOMO the eigenvalue of the one-
electron HF (Roothaan) equation. For the highly corre-
lated F− ion, for example, the two diﬀerent values of κ
diﬀer by 20% and the application of a wrong asymptotic
wave function will introduce a large error when calculat-
ing the MO-SFA LG ionization rates [31]. For the sys-
tems considered here the largest diﬀerence between the
experimental κ and κHF is 10% for NO and less than 5%
for the remaining systems. Thus we conclude that corre-
lation eﬀects do not aﬀect the outer electron signiﬁcantly
for the systems considered here. We believe that the
smallness of the diﬀerences between κ and κHF justiﬁes
the application of the single-active electron models.

With the ionization rates at hand, we calculate the
ion signals by integrating over the temporal and spatial
proﬁle of the pulse [15, 37]. In all experiments discussed

here, the ions were collected through a small pinhole near
the beam waist and the spatial integration should be re-
stricted to this region. As the signals saturate, the signal
ratios will approach unity for such a setup. We calculate
the rates and signals for each molecular orientation and
average the signals over orientations in order to simulate
randomly oriented ensembles.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. N2:Ar

Several experiments have been performed on N2 and
its companion atom Ar [9, 11, 12, 18], and there are
signiﬁcant disagreements between the results. The yield
ratios were estimated to be N2:Ar
0.7 [11], 0.2 [9], 1
[18] and 1.7 [12], respectively. Previous theoretical calcu-
lations with the MO-SFA VG model predicted the N2:Ar
ratio to be above unity [1] while MO-ADK calculations
predicted the ratio to be 0.4
In Ref. [3] it was
shown that the experimental diﬀerences could not be ex-
plained by diﬀerences in pulse lengths and the possibility
of dynamical alignment.

In Fig. 1 we show our calculations for the N2:Ar ratio.
First, we note that the results from each model are nearly
independent of pulse duration. In the length gauge we
predict the ion yields of N2 and Ar to be nearly identi-

cal. These ﬁndings are in reasonable agreement with the
experimental data from Refs. [11, 12]. The diﬀerences
between our MO-ADK results and the results of Ref. [3]
lie in the values of the angular Clm coeﬃcents. We ﬁnd
the ratio to be slightly lower than unity in agreement
with Ref. [11] [Fig. 1 (a)]. The velocity gauge MO-SFA
predicts the ion yield of N2 to be somewhat larger than
for Ar in accordance with Ref. [1]. We ﬁnd an oscillat-
ing behaviour of the signal ratio in the velocity gauge
which is not supported by the experimental data. The
origin of this artifact lies in the concept of channel clos-
ing: At low intensities continuum-continuum transitions
are very weak. The rate of ionization is then typically
dominated by the rate which originates from the low-
est number of photon absorptions, n0. As the intensity
increases the ponderomotive potential rises and eventu-
ally leads to the closing of the n0 channel. The eﬀect of
channel closing on the total ionization rate depends on
the relative importance of the n0 process compared with
the excess-photon processes. As the intensity increases
and a channel closing approaches, the momentum corre-
sponding to n0 photon absorptions will become small. If
the HOMO does not contain an l = 0 component, then
˜ψN →
0, and for such systems the MO-SFA
VG amplitude, Eq. (15), will be suppressed. Near the
channel closings the contribution from the n0 channel is
thus small and the total rate will not be signiﬁcantly af-
fected when this channel closes. If on the other hand the
HOMO contains an l = 0 component, the low momenta
will generally be favoured and the n0 channel gives a large
contribution of the total rate. In this case, the closing of
a channel will therefore lead to an abrupt decrease of the
total rate. These diﬀerences were previously mentioned

in Ref. [38]. In the length gauge, the n0 channel will be
important regardless of the type of orbital due to the pre-
cense of A(t) in the argument of the momentum space
wave function [see Eq. (15)] and we always ﬁnd abrupt de-
creases of the rate across a channel closing. We show the
various eﬀects described above in Fig. 2. The HOMO of
N2 is a σg (l = 0 component) orbital and correspondingly
we ﬁnd a local minimum in the rate around the channel
closings. The highest occupied atomic orbitals of Ar are
the degenerate p (l = 1) orbitals, and we ﬁnd local min-
ima in the length gauge rate while the velocity gauge rate
increases smoothly near the channel closings. The diﬀer-
ences between the parallel and perpendicalar geometries
of N2 in the two gauges was explained in Ref. [2].

B. D2:Ar

Two experiments have been reported on D2 and Ar
[10, 13] and both showed a suppression of the D2 sig-
nal compared with the Ar signal. As mentioned in the
introduction the MO-ADK calculations reproduced this
result [3] while the MO-SFA VG model predicts absence
of suppression because the HOMO of D2 is a bonding σg
orbital.

In Fig. 3, we show our calculations and the experimen-
tal sets of data. We do indeed ﬁnd absence of suppressed
ionization when we use the MO-SFA VG model. On the
other hand the MO-SFA LG and MO-ADK models both

correctly predict suppression. At high intensities the ra-
tio will approach unity as both signals saturate. The
MO-SFA LG model has some problems in predicting the
correct intensity at which this saturation occurs, but we
note that the experiments do not agree on the saturation
intensity either. The longer pulse length should be equiv-
alent to a lower saturation intensity but this is clearly
not the case when comparing the experimental data in
Figs. 3 (a) and (b).

We see that the inclusion of nuclear vibrations reduce
the MO-SFA ratios by a signiﬁcant factor compared with
the ﬁxed nuclei calculations. The origin of this eﬀect was
discussed in Sec. II A 1. The point is simply that the
inclusion of vibrational motion will reduce the rate when
the molecule and the molecular ion have diﬀerent bonding
properties and transitions to many diﬀerent vibrational
states occur.

C. O2:Xe

Suppressed ionization of O2:Xe has been observed re-
peatedly [8, 11, 12]. Theoretically, this was explained
in the MO-SFA VG by the antibonding character of the
πg HOMO of O2 [1]. Another explanation within the
MO-ADK model was given in Ref. [3] where the inter-
pretation was based on the asymptotic charge density of
the πg HOMO. At some molecular orientations the elec-
tronic density will be preferentially perpendicular to the
polarization axis and the rate of ionization will then be
very small. Finally in Ref. [39] it was proposed that nu-
clear dynamics could be responsible for the suppression.
In Fig. 4, we show the experimental data together with
our calculations. Clearly, all experiments and calcula-
tions show suppressed ionization of O2. Before satura-
tion eﬀects become important the theoretical MO-SFA
VG predicts strongest suppression with the ratio below
0.01 while the ratio in MO-SFA LG is
0.03. At low
intensities, the experimental ratios are scattered between
0.02
0.20 which again makes a quantitative comparison
with theories diﬃcult. In the tunneling regime, beyond
the intensity of 1014 Wcm−2, the MO-ADK model pre-
dicts that saturation eﬀects are already important and
thereby the degree of suppression is masked. Experimen-
tally, saturation sets in at much higher intensities around
1014 Wcm−2, in good agreement with the MO-SFA
2
theories.

D. CO:Kr

The ion signal ratio of CO:Kr was measured in Ref. [13]
and found to be around one half.
In Figs. 5 (a) and
(b) we show the results at 800 nm and 1365 nm, respec-
tively. Under the experminental conditions at 800 nm,
the Keldysh parameter exceeds unity. Thus we cannot
rely on the MO-ADK theory and in Fig. 5 (a) we show
only MO-SFA calculations. Both theories predict the ra-
tio to be slightly larger than one. In the MO-SFA VG
model, we ﬁnd that the ratio depends on the intensity in
a similar way as the N2:Ar ratio, and since the electronic
structures of CO and Kr are nearly identical to N2 and
Ar, respectively, we can explain the oscillating behaviour
by the same channel-closing argument (see Sec. IV A).

At 1365 nm and in the intensity range of Fig. 5 (b),
we would expect to be in the tunneling regime. De-
spite the fact that the tunneling theory should be ap-
plicable, the MO-ADK model predicts the ratio to be
somewhat too large. Finally we note that the result of
our MO-ADK calculation is approximately an order of
magnitude larger than the result from Ref. [3]. The only
diﬀerences between these two calculations are the coef-
ﬁcients Cl,m=0 and the time-averaging of the static ﬁeld
rate, our Eq. (20) as compared with Eq. (10) of Ref. [3].

E. Molecules without companion atoms

In Ref. [13] the ion signal ratios of the pairs S2:Xe,
NO:Xe, and SO:Xe were measured. Common to these
pairs is that the ionization potential of Xe is somewhat
higher than the ionization potentials of the molecules.
The ratios measured are thus the results of both the
structural diﬀerences (orientation, electronic wave func-
tions) and the diﬀerence between the binding ener-
gies. The experiments were performed at the wavelength
800 nm with γ > 1, Fig. 6, and at 1365 nm with γ < 1,
Fig. 7.

The electronic structure of S2 is similar to O2 and
we should therefore expect the ionization of S2 to be
suppressed too. Our MO-SFA calculations, shown in
Fig. 6 (a), predict the S2:Xe ratio to be much higher
than measured. Experimentally, the ratio was deter-
mined to be around unity. This indicates that ioniza-
tion of S2 would indeed be suppressed if compared with
a hypothetical companion ion. In Figs. 6 (b)-(c) we show
the calculations for SO:Xe and NO:Xe and ﬁnd a similar
disagreement between theory and experiment for these
pairs. The two previous attempts [3, 13] to explain the
ratios in this intensity regime overestimated the ratios by
5 orders of magnitude. Both calculations were based
3
on tunneling models – in Ref. [13] a purely atomic ADK
model was used and in Ref. [3] the MO-ADK model was
applied. Our present MO-SFA calculations including nu-

clear motion are signiﬁcantly closer to the experimental
data but the agreement is still poor.

In Fig. 7 we show calculations and experimental data at
the wavelength of 1365 nm, i.e., in the tunneling regime.
The experiments were performed at such a high intensity
that saturation eﬀects become important in all our cal-
culations and correspondingly, the ratios are all around
unity. These predictions are in agreement with the exper-
iment for S2:Xe, Fig. 7 (a), and NO:Xe, Fig. 7 (c). From
Fig. 7 (b) we see that the SO:Xe ratio is much lower than
unity. This is quite remarkable since all three ratios in
Fig. 6 were nearly identical at 800 nm but very diﬀerent
at 1365 nm – such wavelength dependencies are of course
impossible to predict by quasistatic tunneling theories.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have made a detailed study of strong-ﬁeld ioniza-
tion of diatomic molecules and their companion atoms.
In particular we have investigated whether the approxi-
mate models: MO-SFA LG, MO-SFA VG and MO-ADK
are able to correctly predict the presence or absence of
suppressed ionization in certain molecules. Furthermore

we have considered how nuclear vibrations can be taken
into account within the adiabatic theory and the single-
active electron approximation.

All models did correctly predict absence of suppressed
ionization for N2:Ar and presence of suppressed ioniza-
tion for O2:Xe. Quantitative comparisons were made
diﬃcult due to disagreements between diﬀerent experi-
ments, and further experiments would therefore be highly
desirable.

We ﬁnd a rather good overall agreement between
the MO-SFA LG theory and experiments on diatomic
molecules and their companion atoms, and we believe
that the MO-SFA LG model accounts quite well for
the structural dependency on the strong-ﬁeld ionization
rates. In general we found the length gauge MO-SFA to
be in better agreement with experiments than the veloc-
ity gauge MO-SFA – in particular in the case of D2:Ar
where the MO-SFA VG predicted no suppression of ion-
ization in contradication with the experimental ﬁndings
and the other theories.

The MO-ADK predictions were mostly in accordance
with previously published results using this model [3].
For the cases N2:Ar, D2:Ar and O2:Xe these predictions
are also in qualitative agreement with experimental data.

The most signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the MO-ADK
and the MO-SFA LG calculations are the much lower ra-
tios predicted by the latter theory in the cases O2:Xe
and CO:Kr. In both cases the results of the MO-SFA LG
model agreed better with the experiments. This is inter-
esting in view of recent experiments [40] which reported
suppression of strong-ﬁeld ionization for transition metal
atoms relative to expectations, but only compared with
tunneling theory, and not SFA. For the future work it
would be interesting to check the SFA LG model on the
transition metals to investigate if the suppression is due
to a general breakdown of the single-active electron mod-
els or if it is due only to a failure of the ADK model.

All the models considered here fail to predict the cor-

10

rect ratio between molecules and atoms with diﬀerent
ionization potentials. This indicates that the depen-
dency on the electronic binding energy is not correctly
accounted for and points to the need for the development
of improved models, including electron-electron correla-
tions and exact ﬁnal states.

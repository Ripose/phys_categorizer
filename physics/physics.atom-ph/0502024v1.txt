Abstract

The hyperﬁne splitting in hydrogenlike 209Bi, 203Tl, and 205Tl is calculated with the nuclear
magnetization determined from experimental data on the hyperﬁne splitting in the corresponding
muonic atoms. The single-particle and conﬁguration-mixing nuclear models are considered. The
QED corrections are taken into account for both electronic and muonic atoms. The obtained re-
sults are compared with other calculations and with experiment.

1 Introduction

High-precision measurements of the hyperﬁne splitting (HFS) in heavy hydrogenlike ions [1, 2,
3, 4, 5] have triggered a great interest to calculations of this effect. The main goal of these exper-
iments was to probe the magnetic sector of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the presence of a
strong Coulomb ﬁeld. The uncertainty of the theoretical results is mainly determined by the un-
certainty of the nuclear magnetization distribution correction, the so-called Bohr-Weisskopf (BW)
effect. In calculations, based on the single-particle nuclear model [6, 7, 8, 9], which provide a rea-
sonable agreement with the experiments, this uncertainty may amount up to about 100% of the
BW effect and is generally few times larger than the total QED contribution. More elaborated cal-
culations, based on many-particle nuclear models [10, 11], do not provide a desirable agreement
with the experiments.

In the present paper, we determine the BW correction to the hyperﬁne splitting of hydrogen-
like 209Bi, 203Tl, and 205Tl using experimental data on the hyperﬁne splitting in the corresponding
muonic atoms. We consider the single-particle and conﬁguration-mixing nuclear models. The pa-
rameters of the nuclear magnetization distribution are chosen to reproduce the experimental values
of the nuclear magnetic moment as well as the BW contribution in muonic atoms extracted from
the corresponding experiments. To increase the precision of determining the BW contribution, the
QED corrections for the muonic atoms have been evaluated. The obtained results are compared
with other calculations and with experiment.

The relativistic units (~ = c = 1) and the Heaviside charge unit (α = e2/(4π), e < 0) are

used in the paper.

2 Hyperﬁne splitting in muonic atoms

The ground-state hyperﬁne splitting in muonic atoms can be written in the form:

∆E = ∆ENS + ∆EBW + ∆EQED,

(2.1)

where ∆ENS is the hyperﬁne splitting value incorporating the relativistic and nuclear charge dis-
tribution (”nuclear size”) effects, ∆EBW is the BW contribution, ∆EQED is the QED correction.
The ∆ENS value can be calculated by the formula:

∆ENS =

(2.2)

where α is the ﬁne structure constant, µ is the nuclear magnetic moment, µN is the nuclear
magneton, mp is the proton mass, and I is the nuclear spin. g(r) and f (r) are the radial parts of
the Dirac wave function:

Ψ(r) =

g(r)Ωκm(n)
if (r)Ω−κm(n)

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

which are determined by solving the Dirac equation with the Fermi distribution of the nuclear
charge (4π

drr2ρ(r) = 1):

R

ρ(r) =

ρ0
1 + exp( r−c
a )

.

Here c is the half-density radius and a is related to the skin thickness t by t = (4 log 3)a, deﬁned
as the distance over which the charge density falls from 90% to 10% of its maximum value.

The individual contributions to ∆E for muonic atoms of 203Tl, 205Tl, and 209Bi are presented
in Table 1. The ∆ENS values are given in the second column. In the third column we present the
BW correction evaluated within the single-particle nuclear model according to the prescriptions
given in [6, 7, 8] (see also the next section of the present paper). The wave function of the odd
nucleon was determined by solving the Schr¨odinger equation with the Woods-Saxon potential. In
muonic atoms, the QED correction is mainly determined by the vacuum polarization (VP) con-
tribution, which consists of the electronic electric-loop and magnetic-loop parts. In the Uehling
approximation, the electric-loop part is determined by the potential:

The total QED correction (∆EQED ≈
ble 1. The total theoretical values obtained in this work (ﬁfth column) are in a good agreement
with the experimental ones (sixth column) and with the previous theoretical calculations [14],
which do not account for the QED corrections. Since the theoretical uncertainty is mainly deter-
mined by the uncertainty of the BW effect, the experimental values of the hyperﬁne splitting in
muonic atoms can be employed to determine the BW contribution and, therefore, the parameters
of the nuclear magnetization distribution for a given nuclear model. Then, with these parameters,
the BW correction to the hyperﬁne splitting in the corresponding electronic ions can be calcu-
lated. Such calculations are presented in the third and fourth sections for the single-particle and
conﬁguration-mixing nuclear models, respectively.

3 Nuclear magnetization in the single-particle model

magnetic moment is given by

where I and L are the total and orbital angular momenta of the odd nucleon. For proton gL = 1
and for neutron gL = 0. In calculations of the HFS the gS factor is usually chosen to yield the
observed value of the nuclear magnetic moment. To calculate the BW effect within the single-
µ(r) = F (r)µ in the HFS operator. The
particle model, one has to adopt the replacement µ

To reproduce the experimental values for the HFS in muonic atoms within the single-particle

∆EQED = (1

where ∆Eµ−
exp and ∆EQED are the experimental value of the HFS for muonic atom and the QED
correction, accordingly. Then we can calculate the BW correction for the corresponding electronic
ions with RM derived from equation (3.7). We have found that the results for the BW correction
(εs.p.) in electronic H-like ions are stable enough within the parameterizations (3.5), (3.6). For this
reason, the uncertainties of εs.p. presented in Table 2, are mainly determined by the uncertainty of
the experimental HFS values in muonic atoms.

4 Nuclear magnetization in the conﬁguration-mixing model

In the conﬁguration-mixing model the nuclear magnetism is determined by the last odd nucleon
and the particle-hole excited states. So, the HFS (without the QED correction) can be represented
as:

∆Ec.m. = ∆Es.p. + δE(∆µ),

where ∆µ is the correction to the nuclear magnetic moment, due to mixing particle-hole states.
The nuclear magnetic moment can be written in the form:

µexp = µs.p. + ∆µ.

With gS and ∆µ derived from equations (4.12), (4.13), we can calculate the BW correction for
the electronic ions. The results of these calculations are presented in Table 3. The values of εc.m.
given in Table 3 are in a good agreement with εs.p. presented in Table 2.

5 Results and discussion

In Table 4 we compare the BW correction to the HFS in electronic H-like ions, derived from
the experiments on muonic atoms. εs.p. and εc.m. are obtained employing the single-particle and
conﬁguration-mixing models, respectively. ε is a value, which corresponds to the parameterization
(3.5) with n = 0 and whose uncertainty covers all the εs.p. and εc.m. values. For comparison, the
values of the BW correction obtained previously by direct calculations within the single-particle
and many-particle models are presented as well. We conclude that our results for ε are stable
enough with respect to a change of the nuclear model. They also have a better accuracy than the
previous single-particle results [6, 7, 8, 9].

In Table 5 we present our ﬁnal theoretical results for the HFS in electronic hydrogen-like ions.
These results, which include the BW correction derived in the present work and the QED correc-
tion taken from [7, 15, 16, 17], are compared with previous calculations and with experiment. As
one can see from the table, our results are closer to the experimental ones, compared to the results
based on the direct calculations within the single-particle nuclear model [8]. However, due to a
higher accuracy of the present results, a small discrepancy between the theory and experiment
occurs for 209Bi82+. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear to us.

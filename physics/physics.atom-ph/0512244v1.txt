A microwave atomic clock scheme based on Rb and Cs atoms trapped in optical lattice with magic
wavelength for clock transition is proposed. The ac Stark shift of clock transition due to trapping
laser can be canceled at some speciﬁc laser wavelengths. Comparing with in fountain clock, the cavity
related shifts, the collision shift, and the Doppler eﬀect are eliminated or suppressed dramatically
in atomic clock when the magic optical lattice is exploited. By carefully analyzing various sources
of clock uncertainty, we conclude that a microwave atomic clock with an accuracy of better than
2 × 10−17 is feasible, which is of the same accuracy as the expected best optical atomic clock.

After the realization of Zacharias’ idea of atomic foun-
tain [1], many advances in high-precision measurement
physics,
fundamental constants
stability [2, 3], have been achieved with atomic foun-
tain clock with a total fractional uncertainty of 3.5
×
10−16 [2, 3, 4, 5]. On the other hand, many critical
improvements of optical atomic clock [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] in
the past several years indicate that a potential competi-
tor with much better uncertainty than the microwave
atomic clocks will soon be the new generation of atomic
clocks. For example, various experimental schemes of
optical clock based on alkaline-earth atoms and Yb
10−17
atoms with an uncertainty of better than 2
are proposed [10, 11, 12, 13]. Except the active opti-
cal clock [11], all passive optical clock schemes use neu-
tral atoms trapped in optical lattices formed by “magic”
wavelength, which can be used to adjust the ac Stark
10−3Hz [8, 9, 10].
shift of clock transition as ﬁne as 1
Advantages of single ion clock and the conventional neu-
tral atom clock are combined there since millions of neu-
tral atoms are trapped within Lamb-Dick regime for long
time clock-laser interrogation. The most recent evalua-
tion of atomic fountain clock is one order of magnitude
better than that of the best achieved optical clock [6, 7].
However, it is obvious that, in atomic fountain conﬁgu-
ration with laser cooled Cs and Rb, to reach a fractional
uncertainty of microwave frequency standard to the level
10−17 is a real technical challenge. Diﬃculties
of 1
mainly arise from the eﬀects of second-order Zeeman ef-
fect, collisions between the Cs atoms, microwave cavity,
atomic motion and blackbody radiation. For microwave
clock transition, it has been preliminarily precluded the
possibility that a blue-detuned dipole trap will supersede
a fountain due to hundreds of mHz residual ac Stark shift
of clock transition in Na atom experiment [14, 15].

However, in this letter, we present the magic wave-
lengths for 133Cs and 87Rb clock transitions. Our cal-
culations show that the ac Stark shift of Cs and Rb

clock transitions can be canceled at some speciﬁc magic
wavelengths of trapping laser. Based on a careful analy-
sis of various sources of clock uncertainty between foun-
tain and lattice conﬁgurations, we conclude that a mi-
crowave atomic clock based on Cs and Rb atoms trapped
in magic wavelength lattices is able to reach an accuracy
of 2

10−17.

To realize such a microwave clock in optical lattices, it
is essential that the polarizabilities of the two clock states
are matched to high accuracy at the magic wavelength.
The frequency shift of clock transition induced by the
axially symmetric electric ﬁeld Ez with gradient Ezz of
the lattice laser is described as [16],

The scalar light shift of clock transition for Cs irra-
diated by a linearly polarized laser is shown in Fig.1.
The ac Stark shift of Cs clock transition due to 6P1/2
and 6P3/2 states are negative at some wavelength re-
gion as the dotted lines show, but the contribution from
7P as the dashed lines and higher states as the dot-
dashed line are positive. The combination of the above
shifts results in cancelation of ac Stark shift of Cs clock
transition due to the linearly polarized trapping laser
at some magic wavelengths. Our calculation predicts
more than one magic wavelengths for Cs clock transition
at 402.2nm, 427.0nm, 493.0nm, 604.8nm as showed in
Fig.1 and for Rb at 370.4nm, 395.6nm, 452.3nm, 549.7nm

If atoms are irradiated by σ± laser, then p =

1 in
Eq.(2), the consequent vector light shift of Cs and Rb
clock transitions are shown in Fig.2. For 87Rb atom,
the ac Stark shift due to σ± light at the magic wave-
10−3
length of π light is also very small, which is 2.3
Hz at 549.7nm with a laser power of 10kW/cm2. The
magic wavelength of the vector light shift is 549.6nm,
10−14 are very
and its tuning rate (2πdνclock)/dω=2.5
close to that of the scalar light shift as mentioned above.
But the vector light shift of Cs clock transition is much
larger than that of π light. Considering a real 3D blue-
detuned optical lattice, the trapped cold atom experi-
ences not only the π light but also σ± light. Thus for Cs,

×

the magic wavelength is mainly determined by the vector
light shift. Even though, the tuning rate (2πdνclock)/dω
10−12 at a magic wavelength of 471nm for
is as low as 1.5
10kW/cm2 lattice laser intensity with 3D laser polariza-
tion conﬁguration of Ex(ˆez), Ey(ˆez), Ez(ˆex), and is good
enough to control the light shift cancelation. It seems,
considering the polarization, 87Rb is a better candidate
than Cs to build a microwave atomic clock with atoms
trapped in 3D optical lattice. The following analysis is
based on Cs, but is also suitable for Rb.

The tensor light shift of clock transition δα2, arising
from the third-order perturbation when the hyperﬁne in-
teraction is taken into account [17], is roughly δhf s/δ of
the α term, where δhf s is the hyperﬁne splitting of the
coupled excited state and δ is the trapping laser detuning
of that state [9]. The tensor light shift of Cs clock tran-
sition is of the order mHz shown in Fig.3. The tuning
10−19, much smaller
rate (2πdνclock)/dω is as low as 1
than that of scalar light shift, hence it only modiﬁes the
magic wavelength a little.

in the cancelation of shift due to δB term and negligible
broadening due to δC term. These shifts are less than
10−8Hz when the trapping laser power is stabilized

to 0.1%. These shifts can also be compensated by scalar
light shift easily. The ac Zeeman shift of clock transi-

collisions with background atoms, which are the three
mechanisms for heating atoms, mainly contribute to the
trap lifetime. For the blue-detuned optical lattice trap,
the atoms are trapped at the minima of laser inten-
sity(the nodes of standing wave), the trap lifetime is
larger than 100s, since the Rayleigh scattering rate is
about 0.01s−1 and the Raman scattering rate is as low
10−6s−1 [22]. For the background pressure of the
as 5
×
10−11Torr, the trap time can be more than
order of 1
300s [24, 25]. In the case when the lattice trapping laser
is stable, the heating arising from laser intensity noise
and beam pointing ﬂuctuation [24, 25, 26] is negligible
then the trap lifetime is ﬁnally limited only by Rayleigh
scattering rate. The microwave pulses of clock transition
are radiated by a dipole antenna close to the lattice posi-
tion [14, 27]. The alternative method of clock transition
interrogation is performed by Raman transition with mi-
crowave modulated laser.

×

We analyze the various sources of clock uncertainty
with a comparison between fountain and lattice conﬁg-
urations as follows and list them in the Table I. In lat-
tice clock conﬁguration, considering atoms are conﬁned
within a very small size like (100µm)3 for 106 atoms con-
ﬁned in lattice with lattice spacing of 300nm, the temper-
ature can be easily controlled to 0.1K , thus the uncer-
10−17 or even
tainty of fractional blackbody shift is 1.3
better. Moreover, this 100µm level location of atoms po-
sition results in a much better stability of gravitational
redshift. But its uncertainty is determined only by the
calibration of orthometric height of atoms position. This
has potential applications in monitoring the change of
gravitational potential due to moon or tide in real-time
when the short-term stability is good. The spin-exchange
collision shift in a Cs fountain clock is at the level of
10−16 [4]
2
at low density.
In lattice clock conﬁguration using 3D
lattice with less than unity occupation, the collision shift
will be eliminated completely [9].

which is set as uncertainty [4] in a fountain clock.While
in the lattice clock, there is no cavity pulling when using
the traveling microwave to interrogate the lattice-trapped
atoms or via Raman process, and no majorana transi-
tion when the residual magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation is much
smaller than the C-ﬁeld. Cavity phase shift [29] and mi-
crowave leakage shift can be eliminated since the Raman
laser beam can be extinguished by mechanical shutter.

For Cs atoms, the second-order Zeeman shift due to
eﬀect of static magnetic ﬁeld Bc in the unit of Gauss on
clock transition is 427
c Hz. The C-ﬁeld in a fountain
clock is about 80nT=0.8mG, the uncertainty of fountain
10−17 [4]. In the lattice clock
clock from C-ﬁeld is 2
conﬁguration, since the atoms are conﬁned within a very
small size like (100µm)3, the requirement for magnetic
ﬁeld shielding and stability techniques will be dramati-
cally relaxed, then the clock uncertainty from C-ﬁeld Bc
10−17 without any dif-
should be controlled less than 1
ﬁculty more than that of fountain clock.

microwave, −→v is the atomic velocity. Assuming the di-
1mrad, υ = 3m/s, for a travel-
rection misalignment is
ing wave, these parameters result in a frequency shift of
0.02Hz. In a fountain, when the clock microwave signal
is fed into the cavity “from the left” or “from the right”,
10−5Hz [3], this means
the observed shift is about 2.5
the residual traveling wave component in the fountain
cavity is near 10−3 of the standing wave component. In
a lattice clock, assuming with the same microwave inten-
sity(the same pulse time about 10ms), the microwave is
a pure traveling wave, thus it is 1000 times of the trav-
eling wave in fountain cavity. And, the atomic average
velocity during the microwave pulse period time 10ms is
300nm/10ms= 6µm/s, where 300nm is the
v
h
lattice spacing, 0.2 means the atom is conﬁned within
the 20% central range near the center of a lattice trap,
and 10ms is the microwave pulse period. Considering the
atomic motion within 3D lattice minima with a oscillat-
ing frequency during the microwave pulse period time
10ms, the net eﬀect of atomic ensemble is a Doppler
10−4Hz. However, there is
spectral-broadening of
×
no net residual ﬁrst-order Doppler shift in a lattice clock.
The second-order Doppler shift due to relativistic time
10−17 [28] in a fountain clock, and will be
dilute is 1
10−21 in lattice clock conﬁguration. Rabi pulling,
< 1
Ramsey pulling, microwave spectral purity, and Bloch-
Siegert shift do not depend on the clock conﬁguration,
but they are determined by the C-ﬁeld, the performance
of synthesizer and other parameters for both clocks.

In summary, we have discussed the feasibility of a
microwave atomic clock based on Rb and Cs atoms
trapped in optical lattice with magic wavelength. By
a careful comparison of various sources of clock uncer-
tainty between fountain and lattice conﬁgurations, we
conclude that a microwave atomic clock with an accu-
10−17 is feasible, which is of the same precision
racy of 2
as the expected optical atomic clock. This clock scheme
overcomes the formidable hurdles in fountain clock aris-
ing from the second-order Zeeman eﬀect, collisions be-
tween the Cs atoms, the microwave cavity, the atomic
motion and the blackbody radiation. Besides the po-
tential application in high-precision measurements, our
clock scheme promises that microwave based second def-
inition in SI units can be realized one order of magnitude
more precisely. Moreover, the practical size of microwave
clock can be reduced to only one third of current foun-
tain size or even smaller, and the idea in this letter is also
applicable for designing primary atomic clock for inter-
national space station [3, 30].

Abstract

High accuracy helium wave functions based on exponentials with random coeﬃcients are trans-

formed into momentum space. The utility of the wave functions is demonstrated through cal-

culation of the expectation value of various operators needed to evaluate relativistic and QED

corrections.

INTRODUCTION

can be written as

In recent years a basis set consisting of random exponentials has been used with increasing

frequency to carry out calculations in helium [1], [2], [3]. For singlet and triplet S-states it

φ(~r1, ~r2) =

Ci[e−αir1−βir2−γir12

where αi, βi, and γi are parameters that are chosen randomly in certain ranges, and the

spin wavefunctions are understood. Through careful choice of those ranges Korobov [1] has

been able to obtain a ground state energy of

E =

2.903 724 377 034 119 598 311 159 a.u..

While even higher accuracies are possible with basis sets that incorporate known nonanalytic

behaviors of the wave function [4], the simple form of the above wave function makes the

evaluation of higher order corrections coming from relativistic and QED corrections relatively

straightforward. In this note we will present calculations based on the momentum space form

of Eq. 1, where the wave function is deﬁned through

To simplify the following discussion, we Fourier transform only the above expression, and

deﬁne it as φi(~p1, ~p2), with the generalization to Eq. 1 being clear. We see that

While this equation for φi(~p1, ~p2) seems quite compact, the action of the three derivatives

leads to a considerably more complicated expression. It simpliﬁes if we introduce the auxil-

iary parameters

where D = x + y2 and y′′ = 2(α + β + γ). We note the following symmetry properties of the

momentum space wave function. Because the basic functions that form the wave function,
x and y, are invariant under the simultaneous replacement ~p1 ↔
states φ(~p1, ~p2) = φ(~p2, ~p1) and for triplet states φ(~p1, ~p2) =
−

↔
φ(~p2, ~p1). Both symmetries

β, for singlet

~p2 and α

also hold when the magnitudes of ~p1 and ~p2 are switched.

There are various uses for the wave function of helium in momentum space, notably

application to scattering calculations. While most work has been carried out with Fourier

transforms of Hartree-Fock wave functions, an approach that includes correlation more com-

pletely is given in Ref. [6]. In that work, a Hylleraas basis set was Fourier transformed and

3

applied to the calculation of a number of helium properties, notably the Compton proﬁle.

While the wave function used here gives a more accurate energy (odd powers of r12 were not

included in the basis set of Ref.

[6]), we do not ﬁnd appreciably diﬀerent answers for any

of the quantities calculated there. In particular, we ﬁnd the same small diﬀerence between

using fully correlated wave functions and Hartree-Fock wave functions for the Compton

proﬁle. Rather than pursuing this line of research we instead now discuss applications of

the momentum space wave function to the calculation of higher order relativistic and QED

corrections to the energies of the 11S0, 21S0, and 23S1 states of neutral helium.

These corrections are obtained from a set of operators Oi, with associated energy shifts

. The ﬁrst set of operators was derived by Breit [7], and describe corrections of

order α2 a.u.. The equation he used in the derivation has certain diﬃculties connected with

negative energy states [8], but later treatments using the Bethe-Salpeter equation [9], [10],

[11] treat negative energy states consistently and allow the systematic treatment of higher

order corrections.

Most recent calculations, however, use the technique of eﬀective ﬁeld theory [12] to derive

the operators. We note in particular the compact rederivation of the Douglas-Kroll [11]

results for contributions to the ﬁne structure of helium in order α4 a.u. of Ref. [13], and the

derivation of contributions to the energy of the ground state to the same order in Ref. [14].

The idea of eﬀective ﬁeld theory is to compare free-particle scattering amplitudes in QED

to an eﬀective nonrelativistic theory, with operators added to the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian

that account perturbatively for the diﬀerence of the amplitudes. Once the operators have

been determined from considering free-particle scattering, they are used as perturbations in

standard bound-state Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation theory to calculate energy shifts.

In this approach it is natural to work in momentum space, and the operators are then

Fourier transformed to coordinate space for numerical evaluation. Here, however, because

we have formed wave functions in momentum space, we avoid this step, and work exclusively

in momentum space. This has the advantage of simplicity, but the disadvantage of being

less accurate than coordinate space. We now give a brief rederivation of the Breit operators

using eﬀective ﬁeld theory, and illustrate their numerical evaluation in momentum space.

The connection of the scattering amplitude of two electrons with momentum p1, p2 to

4

scatter into states with momentum p3, p4 to an energy shift is

If instead we consider diagrams in which one of the electrons, taken to be electron 1, interacts

with the nucleus (eN), and electron 2 does not participate, we can write

eN (~p3, ~p4; ~p1, ~p2) = (2π)3δ3(~p4 −

(14)

Diagrams with all three particles interacting have no delta functions, and have to be evalu-

ated with the 12-dimensional integral of Eqn. 10. In all cases we note that 3 of the integration

variables can be carried out trivially, and that the adaptive Monte-Carlo program VEGAS

[15] can be used to numerically evaluate the integrals, though with far less accuracy than

available from coordinate space techniques. This loss of accuracy is due entirely to the fact

that the multidimensional integrals have to be carried out numerically: the wave functions

themselves are quite accurate. In the calculations presented here we use 600 basis functions,

and the energy eigenvalues are accurate to more than 14 digits for the ground state and 11

for the excited S states.

We begin by evaluating the relativistic mass increase (RMI) operator, which we treat as

an ee diagram. The contribution to the scattering amplitude of this operator is

We next turn to corrections to Coulomb scattering between the electrons. In this case

(17)

. To calculate relativistic

corrections, we use Dirac spinors to describe scattering and work in Coulomb gauge. We

introduce the notation DC to refer to the scattering amplitude with exchange of a Coulomb

photon, and DT for the scattering amplitude with exchange of a transverse photon. The

DC scattering amplitude can then be Taylor expanded in powers of p/m, with the leading

corrections given by

with the understanding that ~p4 = ~p1 + ~p2 −
terms, and sum to πα/m2δ3(~r2 −
erators, which do not contribute to the S-states considered here. We tabulate the Darwin

~r1) in coordinate space. The last two are spin-orbit op-

~p3. The ﬁrst two correction terms are Darwin

terms in the second row of Table 1.

Considering now Coulomb scattering between an electron and the nucleus, which we take

to have charge Z although only Z = 2 will be considered here, the nonrelativistic limit is

with associated energy shift

Again only the Darwin term contribute for S-states, but now corresponds to πZα/m2δ3(~r1),

which we tabulate in the third row of Table 1.

The eﬀect of transverse photon exchange between the electrons is simpliﬁed if we neglect

retardation, which enters in order α3 a.u., and in this approximation we have

. The ﬁrst two terms, referred to as orbit-orbit terms, or as E(2), are

usually evaluated by Fourier transforming into coordinate space. With the present approach,

however, they are quite easily treated, and the result presented in the fourth row of Table

1. The third term is another delta function, and the last terms again vanish for the S-state

considered here. The eﬀect of transverse photon exchange for eN scattering vanishes in the

inﬁnite nuclear mass limit used in this work.

The operators considered so far in this note have been studied for many decades, and have

all been evaluated with much higher accuracy than presented here [16]. The utility of the

present approach lies in the fact that operators that enter in higher order, generally derived

in momentum space, are both fairly complicated when Fourier transformed to coordinate

space, and in addition need to be evaluated with less accuracy than the terms treated above.

We illustrate this point with relativistic corrections that contribute in order mα(Zα)6 to

S-states. A complete set of operators for triplet states has been derived by Pachucki [17]

using an eﬀective ﬁeld theory approach, and we consider here the corrections to one-Coulomb

photon exchange, Eq. 20 of that paper,

V1 =

(23)

This expression corresponds to the next term in the p/m expansion in Eq. 18. While Ref.

[17] treats triplet states, this particular result is also valid for the singlet case. We note

that the last term vanishes for triplet states because of the symmetry φ(~p1, ~p2) =
φ(~p2, ~p1)
mentioned earlier, as also noted in Ref. [17]. The resulting energy shift of the 23S1 state is

−

Eee =

0.0062(2)mα6.

(24)

While again not of high accuracy, we note the extremely simple nature of the coding, which

is almost identical to the program that evaluates the Darwin term. This contrasts with the

more complicated coordinate space calculation, where numerous derivatives must be applied

to wave functions, leading to a much lengthier expression. As with the mα4 corrections, much

higher accuracy is available from working in coordinate space, with -0.006 344 7 mα6 the

known result [18]. However, we note the momentum space accuracy corresponds to 3.7 kHz,

to be compared with the experimental accuracy [19] of 60 kHz.

While the formula for V1 given above is valid for singlet states, it gives a linearly divergent

result in that case. It is quite simple, however, to regulate this divergence in momentum
~pi|
regulator to the case of ground state positronium hyperﬁne splitting can be found in [20]. In

Table II we show results for the expectation value of V1 for the ground state of helium with

diﬀerent cutoﬀs Λ, with the linear dependence on Λ clearly visible. When combined with

other linearly divergent terms in a complete calculation a Λ independent result will obtain

in the limit of large Λ. By improving the accuracy found in this part of the calculation

this procedure can be used to check the results of Ref. [3] without explicitly canceling the

divergences: work on this problem is in progress.

II. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented the formula for the momentum space form of a powerful basis set for

helium. While it has the potential for proving useful for scattering calculations on helium,

we have concentrated on evaluating expectation values of operators that give relativistic and

QED corrections to energy levels. Because these operators are derived in momentum space,

this allows one to work entirely in momentum space. The next step in this research is the

extension to states with nonvanishing angular momentum. The most important application

we have in mind is to the ﬁne structure of helium P states, where recent high-precision mea-

surements by Hessels and collaborators [21] have the potential of allowing a determination

of the ﬁne structure constant α to a precision of 4 ppb. Unfortunately, the present state of

theory is unclear, where the most complete calculation by Drake [22], while consistent with

the ﬁne structure interval ν01 measured in Ref.

[21], is inconsistent with measurements of

the interval ν12 [23], [24]. This inconsistency has also been noted in Ref. [2]. It is possible

8

that the relative simplicity of the method developed here can shed light on this situation.

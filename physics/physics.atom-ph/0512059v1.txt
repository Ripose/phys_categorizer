Polyatomic Molecules Formed with a Rydberg Atom in an Ultracold Environment

We investigate properties of ultralong-range polyatomic molecules formed with a Rb Rydberg
atom and several ground-state atoms whose distance from the Rydberg atom is of the order of n2a0,
where n is the principle quantum number of the Rydberg electron. In particular, we put emphasis
on the splitting of the energy levels, and elucidate the nature of the splitting via the construction
of symmetry-adapted orbitals.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The recent advancement of ultracold physics has made
possible the study of many interesting phenomena, rang-
ing from the formation of molecules in a Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC) [1, 2, 3] to correlation eﬀects in ul-
tracold neutral plasmas [4, 5], where in the former case
the atoms are cooled to temperature in the nano-Kelvin
range. Combined with narrow bandwidth lasers and high
resolution spectroscopy [6], new phenomena can be stud-
ied involving high-lying Rydberg states which have a nar-
row spacing in energy of the order of 10 GHz. One
such example is the theoretical prediction of the for-
mation of ultralong-range dimers by a Rydberg atom
and a nearby ground-state atom [7], the so-called “trilo-
bite” molecules. The potential well supporting the vibra-
tional bound states is extremely weak compared to typi-
cal ground-state molecules. The depth of well is ∼ 15GHz
for n=30, where n is the principle quantum number of
the Rydberg atom, and scales as n−3. The long-range na-
ture of such system, bound at the equilibrium distance
of the order of 103a.u., is rather unusual as well as the
oscillatory feature at the bottom of the potential well.

In this paper we address the question if more than
one ground-state atom can form, together with the Ryd-
berg atom, a polyatomic molecule. We ﬁnd, that shape
and symmetry of such polyatomic molecules follow a sys-
tematics which is well understandable on the one hand
side in terms of trilobite building blocks, that is, linear
combinations of wavefunctions which describe the Ry-
dberg atom and a single ground-state atom. From a
more global perspective these polyatomic molecules can
be classiﬁed according to irreducible representations re-
ﬂecting their symmetry properties, as it is well known in
quantum chemistry.

So far, trilobites have not been identiﬁed experimen-
tally. As the experimentally achieved density of ultracold
atomic ensembles gets higher [8], the likelyhood of detect-
ing such molecular species increases. However, there are
still open questions concerning the realisability of such
a molecule under current experimental conditions. For
example, the Rydberg electron is very likely to interact

with multiple ground-state perturbers, and it is not so
clear at ﬁrst sight as to what the role of Rydberg states
are. The chracterization of polyatomic molecules involv-
ing one Rydberg and several ground-state atoms helps
to understand the possible role of such ground-state per-
turber atoms better.

Technically speaking, we extend the calculations done
by Greene, Dickinson and Sadeghpour [7] to include
multiple ground-state atoms using the Fermi pseudo-
potential treatment. More sophisticated methods exist
[9, 10], but the results do not diﬀer much, whilst the
qualitative features are certainly captured which suﬃce
for the purpose of the present article. Using the Fermi
pseudo-potential also allows one to calculate a large sys-
tem at ease.

We investigate, in particular, the eﬀect of placing the
perturbers in a structured environment on the splitting of
the adiabatic energy levels of the molecular system. We
will use group theory to obtain the total wavefunction of
the system in the framework of ﬁrst-order perturbation
theory via the construction of the symmetry-adapted or-
bitals. For the sake of clarity we restrict the investigation
to atoms all lying in a plane (whereas the Rydberg elec-
tron of course lives in the physical 3D space). Atomic
units are used unless stated otherwise.

II. THE HAMILTONIAN

First, we consider a ground-state atom with label i
located at distance Ri from the Rydberg atom. The
ground-state atom inﬂuences the electron by its polar-
ization ﬁeld, which has the form −α/2r4, where α is the
atomic polarizability. For Rb atoms, the experimentally
determined value is α = 319.2 [11]. To a good approxi-
mation, the potential – extremely short-ranged with re-
spect to the extension of a Rydberg electronic wavefunc-
tion – can be mimiced by the Fermi pseudo-potential,
namely [12],

ˆVi = 2πL[ki]δ(~r − ~Ri).

(1)

is the s-wave energy-
where L[ki] ≡ −(tan δs)/ki
dependent scattering length of the Rydberg electron col-
i /2 = −1/2n2 + 1/Ri
liding with a neutral atom, and k2
is its kinetic energy. The s-wave phase shift δs can be
calculated using the modiﬁed eﬀective range theory by
O’Malley et al [13] and the zero-energy scattering length

for triplet s-wave calculated by Bahrim et al [14]. The
singlet scattering length is much smaller, and hence, we
do not expect it to inﬂuence the phenomena discussed
here.

In the case of Rb atoms, the quantum defect is negli-
gible for high l-states (l > 3) which are quasi-denergate.
They are, therefore, well represented by hydrogenic wave-
functions. The low-l states, on the other hand, split away
from the n-manifold, and do not interact with the high-
l states provided that the energy-dependent scattering
length is suﬃciently small. The high-l states are also
more interesting, because the Hilbert space is larger in
this case, which produces a more ﬂexible system, i.e. the
diﬀerent eigenstates are allowed to interfere with each
other. This results in a highly-polarizable complex. In
this paper, we consider only the high-l class.

The total Hamiltonian of the Rydberg electron inter-
acting with its mother ion and N ground-state atoms can
be written as

where the ionic Hamiltonian is

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆVN ,

The potential VN is the N -fold sum over the interaction
Eq. (1) with all ground-state atoms, i.e.,

ˆVN = 2π

where i labels the i-th ground-state atom, and N is the
total number of ground-state atoms.

III. DETERMINATION OF ADIABATIC
ENERGY CURVES

Under the adiabatic approximation, the energy levels
calculated from the Hamiltonian ˆH (including the per-
turbation) give, automatically, the electronic structure of
the molecular system involving N + 1 atoms. We deter-
mine a cut through the Born Oppenheimer (BO) poten-
tial surface for systems with N = 2, 3, and 4 ground state
atoms which are uniformly placed on a circle with radius
R centered at the Rydberg core. These three cases cor-
respond to linear, triangular, and square geometries, re-
spectively. The cut we choose corresponds to the breath-
ing mode, i.e. R is varied. We calculate the BO curves
using two methods: (i) the direct diagonalisation of ˆH;
and (ii) the projection operator method [15] to construct
symmetry-adapted orbitals and determine the BO curves
from standard perturbation theory. Both methods are
accurate, but the latter gives a deeper insight into the
quantum mechanical properties such as the energy de-
generacy.

ted line) and triatomic molecule (solid lines) as a function of
distance R between Rydberg and ground-state atoms, see also
the sketch for the triatomic molecule with the Rydberg atom

ization, and the points (+) and (◦) are the enegry expectation
values calculated from the symmetry-adapted orbitals Eq. (6)
and (7), respectively. The E = 0 lies at the energy of the
n = 30 manifold.

The Fermi pseudo-potential is usually valid for n &25-
30. For smaller principle quantum numbers, the scat-
tering of e− + Rb and the polarisation of the neutral
perturber by the Rydberg atomic core are not indepen-
dent of each other [16]. Here, we present calculations for
n = 30, which also allows us to compare our results di-
rectly with that previously obtained for the Rb2 dimer
[7, 10].

The eigenvalues from the unperturbed Hamiltonian,
ˆH0, yields simply the hydrogenic energy E0 = −1/2n2,
so for convenience, we set this to be zero throughout this
article.

IV. COLLINEAR TRIATOMIC MOLECULE
(N=2)

Consider two ground-state atoms (A and B) placed on
either side of a Rydberg atom with distances R forming
a collinear triatomic molecule. This conﬁguration cor-
responds to N =2, and the numerical result of the BO
curves are plotted in Fig. 1.

In order to understand the splitting of the energy lev-
els, we use the perturbed state |ψn(~r)i when only one
of the two ground-state atoms is present as the building
block for contructing the total electronic wavefunction.
The perturbed state can be can be explicitly written as

which includes all l’s and m’s with l ≥ 3. We call this
wavefunction the “trilobite” wavefunction since it pro-
duces the probability density like that drawn in Ref. [7].
The two wavefunctions which clearly satisfy the parity of
the collinear geometry are,

and

n (~r)i and |ψB

where the superscript A and B are the labels of the
ground-state atoms, and |ψA
n (~r)i are the
trilobite wavefunctions when only atom A or B is present.
By choosing the projection axis ˆz so that it aligns with
the internuclear axis, the only degenerate states that con-
tribute are those with non-zero value along ˆz. They are
in this case the states with m = 0.

Using the above ansatz to calculate the expectation
value h ˆVN i yields immediately two energies E+ and E−,
which are distinguished by their parities:

E±(R) = L[k]

(2l + 1)|unl(R)|2

l = even for E+,
l = odd for E−,

where L[k] = L[kA] = L[kB], R = | ~RA| = | ~RB| and unl is
the radial part of the hydrogenic wavefunction φnl( ~R) =
unl(R)Ylm(θ, ϕ).

Hence, we see that, with the inclusion of the second
perturber, two curves split away from the n-manifold,
with one corresponding to gerade and the other to
ungerade symmetry. They both converge at large dis-
tance to the curve when only one ground-state atom is
present. However, they split from each other approxi-
mately within R/rn ≤ 1 (with rn = n2a0 = 900) which

internuclear axis at the deepest point of the potential well,
R = 879. The black contour lines show the probibility density
of the trilobite (diatomic) wavefunction, and the background
coloured plot is for the N = 2 (collinear triatomic) conﬁgura-
tion. The ground-state atoms are located at (x, z) =(0, ±879)
and the Rydberg atom at (0, 0). The two white solid lines
show the classical Kepler ellipses.

can be seen from the sum of the probability densities of
even-l and odd-l states. They diﬀer when the overlap
hψB
n i is not exponentially small, see Fig. 2. This fea-
ture is general for all principle quantum numbers. The
additional splitting also suggests that the system can be
more stable with the inclusion of more than one neutral
perturber, a situation we will investigate in more detail
in Section V.

In Fig. 3, we show the contour plot of the probabil-
ity density of the diatomic and triatomic systems at the
interatomic distance Rm = 879, which corresponds to
the deepest potential energy. The special minimum con-
ﬁguration can be most clearly identiﬁed by means of the
classical Kepler orbits along which the two trilobite states
of the molecule are scarred. Each Kepler ellipse has one
ground-state atom in one of its foci and touches the other
ground-state atom.

V. PLANAR POLYATOMIC MOLECULES OF
TRIANGULAR AND QUADRATIC SHAPE
(N=3,4)

For N ≥ 3, we choose ˆz to be perpendicular to the
plane containing the atoms. Figure 4 illustrates the spa-
cial geometry of the complexes. The degenerate states
that contribute, i.e., the index q in Eq. (5), are the states
with l + m being an even integer, exclusive of l = 0, 1, 2
states. The results are shown in Fig. 5.

For the N = 3 case, three energy eigenvalues split away

from the n-manifold, and as in the case of N = 2, be-
yond rn they converge to the BO curve for the dimer
case. Note, however, that two of the energy levels are
degenerate at any given distance within rn, indicating
that there are additional symmetries preserved under the
perturbation of the ground-state atoms. To elucidate
these symmetries, we again use the trilobite state as ba-
sis functions to construct the relevant symmetry-adapted
orbitals. But unlike in the previous collinear conﬁgura-
tion, where taking account of the parity as the relevant
symmetry is intuitive, we have to use a systematic ap-
proach for N =3 or larger. A method which has been
used extensively to ﬁnd the symmetry-adapted orbitals is
the projection operator method, which is expressed math-

where ˆOR is the operator for a particular symmetry op-

χj are, respectively, the dimension and the character of
the j-th irreducible representation (irrep) of the symme-
try group, to which the system belongs, while h is the
order of the group. The sum extends over all symmetry
operations in the group. This equation allows us to ﬁnd
the symmetry-adapted functions {gi} from any original
basis set {fi}. The general proof of this proceedure can
be found, for example, in section 6.6 of Ref. [18].

The name of this procedure originates from the fact
that the pre-factor in front of f in the above equation
can be viewed as a projection operator that projects the
basis set {fi} into a basis set {gi} that diagonalizes the
Hamiltonian matrix. In other words, g and f in Eq. (9)
are vectors, and the operator

can be represented by a unitary matrix.

The conﬁgurations of N =3 and 4 correspond to the
symmetry groups C3,v and C4,v, and their character ta-
bles of the irreducible representations are shown in Ta-
ble I.

We ﬁnd that in the N =3 case, the representation of the
symmetry operations using the trilobite state as the basis
set contains only two of the total three irreducible repre-
sentations, Γ1 and Γ3 (see Table II(a) and Appendix A 1
for details), which are one- and two-dimensional respec-
tively. The symmetry-adapted orbitals constructed will
then, according to the fundamental theory of quantum
mechanics, consist of a non-degenerate and two degen-
erate states. They are, repectively, g1, g2 and g3 shown
explicitly in Eq. (A5), (A6a) and (A7) in Appendix A 1.

calculated using the gi-functions i = 1, 2, 3 are plotted
in Fig. 5. As expected, the two curves belonging to Γ3
overlap with each other at all distances R. Note that
applying ˆPΓ2 onto any of the basis functions produces
zero, which is a general feature when the irrep is not
contained in the overall representation.

The same analysis for the C4,v symmetry reveals that
the overall representation contains Γ1, Γ3, and Γ5 (see
Table. II(b)), with the ﬁrst being one-dimensional, and
the second and the third two-dimensional (see Appendix
A 2 for detail). Hence, there are two sets of doubly-
degenerate BO curves and a non-degenerate one. Ap-
plying Eq. (9), we obtain the symmetry-adapted orbitals
gi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 as shown in Eq. (A11)-(A14) in Appendix
A 2. The adiabatic energy levels from the analytical and
numerical results are plotted in Fig. 6. Again, the graph
shows a perfect agreement between the two results.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have used the Fermi pseudo-potential to model the
eﬀect neutral Rb ground-state atoms have on a Ryd-
berg electron. Cuts through the resulting potential sur-
face, adiabtic in the distance of the ground-state per-
turbers from the ionic core of the Rydberg electron, have
been calculated for diﬀerent arrangements of the ground-
state atoms which form planar polyatomic molecules.
We found that more ground-state atoms lead to more
deeply bound molecules compared to the original diatom
as studied by Greene and coworkers [7]. A systematic
understanding of the structure and symmetry of such
molecules can be gained by taking the trilobite (diatomic)
wavefunction as a basic unit and construct symmetry-
adapted orbitals as demonstrated in Section IV and V.
For two ground-state atoms the procedure is relative sim-
ple and intuitive, while three or more ground-state atoms

5

require a systematic approach, such as the projection op-
erator method.

In the case where N is larger than the number of de-
generate states qmax, our method of constructing the per-
turbed wavefunction should still work, and will yield only
qmax linearly independent states.

The present work is a ﬁrst exploration of the possibil-
ity to form polyatomic molecules from a single Rydberg
atom and a number of ground-state atoms. We have only
determined a cut (at equal distances of the ground-state
atoms to the Rydberg atom) through the multidimen-
sional potential surface which resembles the potential for
the breathing mode of the molecule. Future analysis and
realistic assessment of the quantitative features of such
species must include the vibrational motion of the atoms.

ˆOC 1

rotation about ˆz in the counter-clockwise direction, as-
suming that ˆz is pointing perpendicularly into the paper,

From Eq. (A1), the character of the representation in

each matrix, and they are summarised in the table below:

Γtotal 3

Here, we have used Γtotal to denote the representation
formed by the trilobite states. By inspecting the charac-
ter table of the irreps of C3,v (Table II(a)), one immedi-
ately sees that the current representation is a direct sum
of Γ1 and Γ3, namely,

Γtotal = Γ1 ⊕ Γ3.

(A3)

Now, we determine the projection operators in each irrep
by using Eq. (10). The order of the group is h = 6, and
the dimensions for Γ1 and Γ3 are l1 = 1 and l3 = 2,
respectively. Equation (10) then yields

ˆPΓ1 =

ˆOE + ˆOC 1

3 + ˆOC 2

3 + ˆOσv1 + ˆOσv2 + ˆOσv3

ˆPΓ2 =

ˆOE + ˆOC 1

3 + ˆOC 2

ˆPΓ3 =

Since Γtotal contains only Γ1 and Γ3, we need to apply
only Eq. (A4a) and (A4c) to our basis set in order to
obtain the symmetry-adapted orbitals. Acting the triv-
ial operator ˆPΓ1 on the trilobite wavefunction |ψA
n i, we
obtain the ﬁrst symmetry-adapted orbital

The character of Γtotal can again be determined by

taking the trace of each matrix above, and they are:

Again, from the character table of the irrep (Table

sum of

Hence, we know that in this representation there are two
one-dimensional and one two-dimensional irreps. Their
corresponding projection operators can be obtained by
applying Eq. (10), where in this case, h = 8, and l1, l3 and
l5 are 1, 1 and 2, repectively. Therefore, the projection
operators are

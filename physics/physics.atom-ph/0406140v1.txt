The ground-state energy of three-body ions (M +, M +, m−) evolves when the like-charge con-
stituents are given diﬀerent masses. The comparison of (m+
) with the average of
−
(m+
) reveals a competition between the symmetric term and the anti-
symmetric one. The former dominates in the Born–Oppenheimer regime such as the (p, t, e) case,
-like systems with two negative light particles surrounding a heavy
while the latter wins for H
nucleus. A comparison is also made with the case of baryons in simple quark models with ﬂavour
independence.

INTRODUCTION

 

There are many examples of molecules built out of con-
stituents with identical charge which might acquire diﬀer-
ent masses when isotopes become involved. For instance,
the H2 molecule is seen in several variants such as DT
where deuterium and tritium replace the protons. In the
ﬁeld of exotic atoms and molecules, many conﬁgurations
can be envisaged, such as (p, µ−, π−) where two of the
constituents have slightly diﬀerent masses.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the variation of en-
ergy in the simplest case of the ground state of H+
2 -like
conﬁgurations. There is already a considerable literature
on such systems [1], and tables of very accurate varia-
tional energies are available. The mass-dependence of the
energy has also been analyzed, and useful approximate
formulas have been proposed. Here, we shall restrict our-
selves to the speciﬁc problem of symmetry breaking.

For consistency, the mass-dependence of the energy
2 , m−) ion will be analyzed
E(m1, m2) of the the (m+
1 , m+
from the published (or recalculated) values at several
neighbouring points, or from an estimate of the ﬁrst and
the second-order perturbation terms calculated with the
wave function of a central conﬁguration (M +, M +, m−).

The behaviour of the (m1, m2, m) systems as a func-
tion of m1 and m2 for a given third mass m and a given
interaction potential was debated some years ago in the
framework of conﬁning quark models with ﬂavour inde-
pendence, that is to say, an interaction that does not
change when the mass of any of the quarks is varied,
in the same way as the Coulomb potential governs H−,
2 , or Ps−. This note oﬀers the opportunity to make a
H+
comparison between the atomic and hadronic cases.

For the ground state, the energy is a concave function
of any parameter entering the Hamiltonian linearly [2],
in particular an inverse mass. The result is true for the
ground state of any given angular momentum, or for the
sum of the n ﬁrst levels.

. This is due to p2

metric case, corresponding to the Hamiltonian

is shown as a function of the ratio x = m/M , for m = 1.
The monotonic and concave behaviour is clearly seen.

2

The values of Fig. 1 can be taken from Ref. [3], but we
have preferred to recalculate the energies using a similar
variational method employing randomly chosen complex
exponents [4]. The regular pattern indicates that a safe
interpolation of the binding energy can be done from a
few values of the masses.

The concavity property in Fig. 1 shows that, within
symmetric conﬁgurations, the state (M +, M +, m−) has
1 , m−) and
its energy above the average of (m+
2 , m−) if its inverse mass is taken the exact av-
(m+

The system of interest is, however, (m+

2 , m−), and
it receives a downward shift with respect to its sym-
metrized version (M +, M +, m−). Indeed, the Hamilto-
nian (1) can be rewritten as

The symmetry-breaking term ∝ (m

ground-state energy, as can be seen by applying the vari-
ational principle to (4), with the symmetric ground state
of HS as trial wave function.

In short, when comparing the average of (m+

2 , m−) to the mixed state (m+

there is a conﬂict between the concave behaviour in the
average inverse mass of the positive particles, and the
downward shift due to symmetry breaking.

Starting from the conﬁguration (M +, M +, m−), one

can write the expansions

III. RESULTS

A. Stability

It can be shown analytically [5] that (M +, M +, m−) is
stable against dissociation into (M +, m−) and an isolated
M +, for any value of the mass ratio M/m. The binding
energy

EB = E(M +, M +, m

improves dramatically as M increases,
in the region
where M > m. However, EB/Eth is not monotonic in
the full range of values of M/m. In Fig. 2, it is seen that
the binding energy reaches its minimum at M ≈ 0.5 and
then starts to increase again when the system goes to the
H

limit.

B. Concavity vs. symmetry breaking

(6)

In order to analyze the behaviour of E(m1, m2, m)
(see
around the central conﬁguration E(M, M, m)
Eq. (5)) we introduce the two operators which determine
the coeﬃcients of expansion in (5), namely,

Vs = p2

1 + p2
2 ,

and Va = p2

1 − p2

= E(M, M ) + µ2ǫ2,s + · · ·

(7)

The perturbation theory gives

ǫ1,s = hΨ0|Vs|Ψ0i ,

The coeﬃcients ǫ can be estimated either by ﬁtting
the energies computed for the neighbouring values of the
constituent masses, or estimated from the wave function
of (M +, M +, m−), using perturbation theory. The gen-
eral results listed above translate into ǫ1,s > 0 for each
level, and ǫ2,s < 0 and ǫ2,a < 0 for the ground state in
any sector of conserved quantum numbers.

Results of numerical calculations are presented in Ta-
ble I. From these data one can get, for instance, an ap-
proximate value for the HD+ ion ground state, using data
for M = 3000 and Eq. (5),

to be compared with the exact solution

niﬁcant digits for the energy.

From these data one may deﬁne approximate bounds

for the stability region by solving the equation,

with respect to µ. Here we assume that m1 > m2
and m = 1. The variation of µ corresponds to mov-
ing along an horizontal line in the triangle of normal-
ized inverse masses [6]. The value of µ obtained from
Eq. (13) for M = 0.1 is µ ≈ −0.55, that corresponds
to m1 = 0.112 and m2 = 0.0901, the ratio of these two
masses is m1/m2 = 1.25.

The ratio of the symmetric to asymmetric second-order
terms (i.e., concavity vs. symmetry breaking) is shown in
Fig. 3. In the adiabatic region M ≫ m, the symmetric
term dominates. An inverse hierarchy is observed in the

C. H+

2 “gerade” and “ungerade” ground states

To get a diﬀerent insight to the problem, we now com-
pare the concavity and symmetry breaking terms for the
H+
2 molecular ion ground states of diﬀerent symmetry,
starting from the molecule with identical nuclei. The
2pσu (or “ungerade”) state is bound by a very shallow
potential and lies very close to the threshold. On con-
trary, the 1sσg potential well supports the existence of
19 vibrational states. Hence it is anticipated that open-
ing the coupling between the “gerade” and “ungerade”
states lowers the ground 2pσu state more rapidly than
the ground 1sσg state.

Numerical results are presented in Tables II and III.
The “ungerade” ǫ2,a exhibits much slower convergence,
since the intermediate state, or the ﬁrst-order perturba-
tion wave-function, a symmetric function being solution
for the 1sσg potential at about zero energy, has multiple
nodes that the variational approximation should repro-
duce with a reasonable accuracy. This makes the numer-
ical calculations more delicate.

The results in the Tables II and III illustrate our con-
jecture that that the symmetry breaking eﬀect for the
case of 2pσu state is much stronger than for the “ger-

It was even conjectured that Eq. (16) might be gener-
ally true, though resisting proof. Then Lieb found [10]
counterexamples, which were further extended in [8, 11].
Lieb also found wide classes of potentials for which the
inequality (16) is rigorously proven. Note that the quark

V. CONCLUSION

IV. COMPARISON WITH BARYONS

In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), quarks are cou-
pled to gluons through their colour. The static potential,
which serves as ﬁrst approximation to describe the inter-
action, is thus independent of the mass of the quarks
experiencing this potential. This property, called ﬂavour
independence, stimulated several studies on how the spec-
trum evolves in a given conﬁning potential, as a function
of the quark masses. For references, see Refs. [7, 8].

In the case of mesons, once the centre-of-mass motion
is removed, the interaction Hamiltonian depends only
upon the reduced mass µ, and the inequality [7, 8]

2E2(m1, m2) ≥ E2(m1, m1) + E2(m2, m2) ,

(15)

holds whatever ﬂavour-independent potential V (r12) is
assumed.

In the case of baryons, it was always found for plausible

ﬂavour-independent potentials [9], that

2E3(m1, m2, m) ≥ E3(m1, m1, m)+E3(m2, m2, m) . (16)

The approximate equality observed for experimental
baryon masses (the contribution of constituent masses
is identical on both sides) is due to a cancelation of this
concave behaviour with the convex behaviour of hyper-
ﬁne corrections.

1 , m+

In this article, we have studied the eﬀect of break-
ing the m1 = m2 symmetry in the ground state
2 , m−). Two regimes are identiﬁed. For m1 and
(m+
m2, much heavier than the negatively charged particle of
mass m, the heavy particles experience an eﬀective two-
body potential. Then the dynamics depends mainly on
the sum of inverse masses, a property that becomes exact
in the case of two-body systems, or in the case of mesons
in a ﬂavour-independent quark–antiquark potential. In
this situation, the inequality (16) is observed. Now, for
m1 and m2 of the order of m or smaller, in the H
limit,
the asymmetric term (p2
2) plays a more important
role, and the reversed inequality is observed.

1 − p2

−

For the adiabatic systems, which have both symmetric
and antisymmetric bound states, the symmetry breaking
eﬀect is much stronger for the upper antisymmetric state,
and is the dominant contribution, while the concavity
term (p2

2) is rather negligible.

1 +p2

We intend to study the case of excited states, and more
complicated structures, such as hydrogen-molecule-like
2 , m−, m−), and to extend the results of
states (m+
our present work to the higher order perturbation terms.

Emergence of Classical Orbits in Few-Cycle Above-Threshold Ionization

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for atomic hydrogen in few-cycle laser pulses is solved
numerically. Introducing a positive deﬁnite quantum distribution function in energy-position space,
a straightforward comparison of the numerical ab initio results with classical orbit theory is facili-
tated. Integration over position space yields directly the photoelectron spectra so that the various
pathways contributing to a certain energy in the photoelectron spectra can be established in an
unprecedented direct and transparent way.

Tunneling ionization in strong laser ﬁelds is a prime
example for nonperturbatively driven quantum systems.
The complex structure in the photoelectron spectra can
be interpreted in terms of interfering quantum orbits in
the spirit of Feynman’s path integral approach [1, 2].
The recently achieved generation of phase-stabilized few-
cycle laser pulses [3] oﬀers the opportunity to control the
continuum quantum dynamics of the released electrons
or, vice verse, to use the electron spectra for measur-
ing the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the laser with sub-cycle
time-resolution [4].

The hierarchy of theoretical approaches to few-cycle
above-threshold ionization (FCATI) ranges from “sim-
ple man’s theory” (SMT), considering only the classical
orbits of the released electrons, via more quantitative,
semi-analytical theories such as the “strong ﬁeld approx-
imation” (SFA) including rescattering of the electron at
its parent atom and quantum orbit theory (QOT) (see,
e.g., [2] for a review), to the exact, numerical ab ini-
tio solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
(TDSE). The latter yields all observables that can pos-
sibly be measured in an experiment. However, a real,
intuitive understanding of the underlying physical mech-
anisms can only be obtained with the help of simple ap-
proaches such as SMT.

This work aims at providing a connection between the
exact, numerical result and simple physical pictures. To
that end a quantum distribution function is introduced in
whose positive deﬁnite probability density wave packets
oriented along classical trajectories emerge as the tun-
neling ionization regime is approached. The method is
applied to FCATI where the dominating classical orbits
are extremely sensitive to the so-called carrier-envelope
phase (CEP).

Let |Ψ(t)i be the numerically determined exact solu-
tion to the TDSE i∂t|Ψ(t)i = ˆH(t)|Ψ(t)i describing the
outermost electron interacting with a laser ﬁeld, i.e.,

H(t) =

[ ˆp + A(t)]2 + V (r)

(1)

(atomic units are used throughout). Here, A(t) is the
vector potential of the laser ﬁeld in dipole approximation

(which is well justiﬁed for the laser parameters to be
discussed in this work), and V (r) is the atomic potential.
The electric ﬁeld of the laser is given by E(t) =
−∂tA(t). We assume that it is linearly polarized and
has the form

E(t) = ˆE(t)ez cos(ωt + φ)

(2)

with ˆE(t) being the pulse envelope covering N laser cy-
cles of period T = 2π/ω, ˆE(t) = ˆE sin2[ωt/(2N )] for
0 ≤ t ≤ Tp = N T and zero otherwise. The CEP (or “ab-
solute”) phase φ in (2) is irrelevant for long pulses. Since
recently, however, few-cycle laser pulses with stabilized
CEP φ can be generated [3, 4]. Under such conditions the
phase φ strongly inﬂuences the dynamics of the released
electrons [5].

The method introduced in this work is based on the
projection technique proposed in [6]. The component
|Φγ(E)i of the ﬁnal wave function |Ψf i = |Ψ(Tp)i that
contributes to energies within the bin of width 2γ cen-
tered at E is calculated as

|Φγ(E)i = ˆWγ(E)|Ψf i

(3)

where ˆWγ(E) = γ2n
/[( ˆH0 − E)2n
], and ˆH0 is the
Hamiltonian without laser ﬁeld. With increasing or-
der n = 1, 2, 3, . . . the energy-window ˆWγ(E) becomes
more and more rectangular. Numerically, the energy
component |Φγ(E)i is calculated by solving the equation
ˆW −1
γ (E)|Φγ(E)i = |Ψf i, making use of the factorization

( ˆH0 − E)2n
k=1 [ ˆH0 − E + exp(iνn,k)γ][ ˆH0 −
E −exp(iνn,k)γ]. The phases νn,k can be easily calculated
up to the desired order n. The lowest order values read
ν1,1 = π/2, ν2,1 = 3π/4, ν2,2 = π/4.

the energy-resolved probability density. Pγ(E, Ω, r) may
be viewed as a quantum distribution function in energy
and position space. Integration over position space yields
indeed the electron energy spectrum. However, integra-
tion over energy yields only approximately the spatial
probability density. For our purposes, the great advan-
tage of (4) in comparison to, e.g., the Wigner distribu-
tion function, is (i) that Pγ(E, Ω, r) is positive deﬁnite
and (ii) that the energy-width γ serves as an additional
parameter, which turns out to play a crucial role for the
emergence of classical orbits, as will be demonstrated in
the following.

Figure 1 shows the distribution Pγ(E, Ω, r) with γ =
0.04 for the electron of H(1s) after a 4-cycle pulse with
CEP φ = 0, ω = 0.056 (800 nm), and ˆE = 0.0834
(corresponding to 2.4 × 1014 Wcm−2) in polarization di-
rection ez (a) and −ez (b).
Integration over the posi-
tion coordinate yields the photoelectron spectra shown
at the right-hand-side. Note that bound state energies
E < 0 are properly treated; the ground state popula-
tion at E = −0.5 is clearly visible. Despite the short
pulse duration, the spectra still show the usual pat-
tern: after a ﬁrst plateau up to ≈ 2Up = 1.1 (with
Up = ˆE2/(4ω2) the ponderomotive energy), the photo-
electron yield drops down to the second plateau, reach-
ing up to ≈ 10Up = 5.5. While for the electrons leav-
ing in ez direction (a), the latter plateau is well devel-
oped, the yield continues to decrease more rapidly for
the electrons in the opposite direction (b). In both di-
rections a clear interference structure is visible for ener-
gies in the second plateau. These interferences translate
to the Pγ-distribution where they appear as horizontal,
white stripes. In general, the energy-resolved probability
density shown in Fig. 1 is rather delocalized in position
space (note that more than 1000 a.u. in z-direction are
covered). This is expected since the photoelectrons con-
tributing to a certain energy may be well described by
plane waves once the laser pulse is over and they are suﬃ-
ciently far away from the origin. These plane waves may
interfere destructively, giving rise to the complex pattern
visible in the photoelectron spectra. The rather sharp
interference patterns in the spectra of Fig. 1 are thus al-
ways accompanied by a spatially delocalized density Pγ.
SMT, on the other hand, deals with classical trajectories
of point-like electrons.

distributions (γ = 0.04, n = 3) after a 4-cycle pulse with
φ = 0, ω = 0.056, ˆE = 0.0834 in (a) ez-direction,
i.e.,
Ω = (ϑ, ϕ) = (0, 0) (ϕ is arbitrary for linear polarization
along ez), and in (b) −ez-direction Ω = (π, 0). Directional
photoelectron spectra at the right-hand-side are obtained by
integrating Pγ over r with ϑ ﬁxed.

Let us brieﬂy review SMT: an electron is “born” at
time t0 with zero initial velocity and from then on moves
in the laser ﬁeld as if there were no Coulomb potential.
In the case of a laser ﬁeld polarized in z-direction, the
t0dt′ E(t′) =
velocity at times t ≥ t0 is v(0)
A(t) − A(t0) so that the ﬁnal photoelectron energy and
the position are given by

back to the origin, it may rescatter at time tr if the
condition |z(0)(tr)| ≤ dr is fulﬁlled. The smaller the
distance dr is allowed to be, the less rescattering solu-
tions exist in SMT. Upon rescattering electrons may as-
sume a lateral velocity. Let χ denote the scattering angle
with respect to the velocity vector of the incoming elec-
tron. The velocity after the (elastic) scattering event
then reads (using cylindrical coordinates z, ρ) v(1)(t) =

SMT is able to predict all the possible positions

kin. The higher is the ionization
probability at time t0 (and the rescattering probability
at time tr) the higher should the probability to actually
measure an electron at the positions predicted by SMT
be. In QOT, this is taken into account on the level of
an extended SFA transition amplitude with rescattering
included [2].

Let us now compare the numerically determined Pγ-
distribution with the SMT predictions. In Fig. 2 the ﬁnal
positions z(0)(Tp) and z(1)(Tp) are presented as a function
of the emission time t0 for the laser pulse with parame-
ters as given in the caption of Fig. 1. The ﬁnal positions
z(0)(Tp) (direct electrons) are plotted in bluish color, the
ﬁnal positions z(1)(Tp) of the rescattered electrons with
χ = π are plotted reddish. The lighter the color is, the
higher was the absolute value of the electric ﬁeld am-
plitude at the time of emission (i.e., the higher was the
ionization probability).

Figure 3 shows the Pγ-distributions corresponding to
Fig. 1, now calculated with a ten times wider energy-
window (γ = 0.4). The SMT predictions of Fig. 2 are
included using the same color coding. The larger energy
width allows for rather localized electron wave packets in
position space because of the uncertainty principle with
respect to ˆH0 and r. The wave packets are clearly ori-
ented along the classically expected positions for suﬃ-
ciently high energies. The dotted spectra on the right-
hand-side were calculated with γ = 0.4 as well, clearly
showing that the emergence of the classical orbits in the
energy-resolved probability density Pγ is accompanied by
a loss of energy resolution. Compared to the solid spec-
tra (calculated with γ = 0.04), the interference pattern
in the rescattering plateau is completely washed out in
(a) and barely visible in (b). Instead, a constructive in-

electrons with χ = π (r1–r5). The shape of the laser ﬁeld is in-
dicated (dashed). The rescattering condition was |z(0)(tr)| ≤
dr = 1. Only emission times t0 where |E(t0)| ≥ ˆE/10 were
taken into account in the calculation of z(1)(Tp). The lighter
the color is, the higher is the absolute value of the ﬁeld ampli-
tude at the time of emission. Same color-coding and labelling
are used in Fig. 3.

terference between the rescattering branches r2 and r4 is
observed in the Pγ-distribution of Fig. 3b.

The result for the electrons in −ez-direction in Fig. 3b
is particularly interesting because of the two competing
rescattering solutions reaching up to high energies. As
expected from SMT, the dominating solution ﬁrst fol-
lows the more probable direct pathway (the lighter blue
branch up to |z| ≈ 400). At energies beyond the direct
cut-oﬀ E ≈ 1.1, the quantum mechanical result continues
to follow this branch despite the fact that the rescat-
tering branches r3 and r4 are more likely. This is be-
cause, contrary to the sharp cut-oﬀs in SMT, the transi-
tion from the direct plateau in the spectrum down to the
six orders of magnitude less probable rescattering regime
is smooth in the quantum mechanical result. Once the
level of the rescattering plateau is reached, the dominat-
ing branch is given by the SMT solution r4. The energy
cut-oﬀ of r4 is again quantum mechanically extrapolated
up to E ≈ 4.5 before the less likely but to higher energy
It is this

branch r2 that deﬁnes the highest possible classical en-
ergy E ≈ 5 and thus deﬁnes the ultimate classical cut-oﬀ
for the electrons in −ez-direction. The preceding analysis
nicely demonstrates the usefulness of the Pγ-distribution:
through the comparison with the expected electron po-
sitions in SMT, the contribution of various pathways to
each energy in the exact, numerically determined pho-
toelectron spectrum can be understood in simple terms
and great detail.

So far our study was restricted to electrons moving
along the laser polarization direction. Figure 4 shows

function Pγ with variable energy resolution γ for the iden-
tiﬁcation of relevant quantum orbits has been introduced.
Upon decreasing the energy resolution, the emergence of
localized wave packets is observed if the phenomenon un-
der investigation is accessible to (quasi) classical theory.
The proposed method has been applied to the numeri-
cally determined, exact electron wave function for H(1s)
in few-cycle laser pulses. Pronounced interference pat-
terns at high energies have been observed in the photo-
electron spectra. Using the Pγ-distribution, the complex
structure of the electron spectra has been analyzed in
terms of interfering, delocalized electrons at high energy
resolution and localized electron wave packets at lower
energy resolution. In that way the connection between
the classical orbits of so-called “simple man’s theory” and
quantum orbit theory has been established, starting from
the exact, numerically determined wave function.

Dotted spectra at the right-hand-side were also calculated

Pγ-distributions (γ = 0.04) at time t = Tp in the ρz-

according (7) and (8) are included in the plots. Note
that for the ﬁrst three phases φ no SMT solutions exist
for electrons traveling in −ez-direction since E = 5.0 lies
beyond the corresponding classical cut-oﬀ in these cases.
The classical solutions (where they exist) agree well with
the quantum mechanical results. At high energies, the
electron emission into narrow cones oriented along the
laser polarization direction is predicted by SMT and well
conﬁrmed by the numerical result. Figure 4 illustrates
the strong phase-dependence of few-cycle ATI. For φ =
π/4 almost no electrons of the selected energy are emitted
in −ez direction. For φ = π/4 and π/2 a destructive
interference for the emission angle ϑ = 0.245 (dotted line
in (b) and (c)) is observed, which is absent for the other
two phases where maximum emission of electrons with
E = 5.0 is not in ez-direction but slightly oﬀ-axis.

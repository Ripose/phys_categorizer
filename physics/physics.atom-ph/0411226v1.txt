A suggested search for 207Pb nuclear Schiﬀ moment in PbTiO3 ferroelectric

We suggest two types of experiments, NMR and macroscopic magnetometry, with solid PbTiO3
to search for the nuclear Schiﬀ moment of 207Pb. Both kinds of experiments promise substantial
improvement over the presently achieved sensitivities. Statistical considerations show that the im-
provement of the current sensitivity can be up to 10 orders of magnitude for the magnetometry
experiment. Such signiﬁcant enhancement is due to the strong internal electric ﬁeld of the ferro-
electric, as well as due to the possibility to cool the nuclear-spin subsystem in the compound down
to nanokelvin temperatures.

The existence of permanent electric dipole moment
(EDM) of a quantum particle requires that fundamental
parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries are violated.
By the CPT-theorem, this would also mean the violation
of the combined CP (charge conjugation–parity) symme-
try. Studies of T and CP violation in Nature provide
valuable information for the theories of baryogenesis, and
for our understanding of fundamental interactions in gen-
eral. Thus, considerable eﬀort has been put into searches
for EDMs of particles, atoms and molecules.

(aB is the Bohr radius.) Together with the neutron EDM
data [1], this result provides most signiﬁcant limits on the
models of CP-violation in hadronic sector, see Refs. [3,
6, 7].

The EDM collaboration [8] plans to improve the sensi-
tivity of the neutron EDM measurements by two orders
of magnitude. Comparable sensitivity is expected in the
proposed deuteron EDM experiment [9]. The next gen-
eration experiments with the electron EDM are also on
the way – these are measurements with metastable lev-
els of PbO [10] and YbF [11] molecules. The expected
improvement of sensitivity compared to the atomic Tl ex-

periment [2] is also about two orders of magnitude. Ro-
malis suggested to use liquid Xe for EDM measurements
[12]. Since Xe atoms are diamagnetic, the measurement
is mainly aimed at the 129Xe nuclear Schiﬀ moment. By
statistical considerations only, the sensitivity of the ex-
10−37 e cm for 10 days of
periment is d(129Xe)
×
averaging [12]. Taking into account the smaller nuclear
charge of Xe, this eﬀectively means improvement by 8 or-
ders of magnitude when compared to the present result
(2) for 199Hg. The limitations because of the systematic
eﬀects are also discussed in Ref. [12]. The solid state ex-
periment with gadolinium garnet, recently suggested by
Lamoreaux [13] to measure the electron EDM, promises
5 order of magnitude improvement over the current Tl
result (statistical estimate corresponding to 10 days of
averaging.)

In the present paper we suggest to use ferroelectric
PbTiO3 to measure Schiﬀ moment of 207Pb nucleus. Pos-
sibility to measure the macroscopic magnetization in-
duced by electric ﬁeld, as was suggested by Lamoreaux
for gadolinium garnets [13], looks most promising be-
cause of the large internal electric ﬁeld in ferroelectric.
In addition, the nuclear-spin subsystem of the compound
can be magnetically cooled down to nanokelvin temper-
atures. For a 10-day averaging, statistics allows to reach
the sensitivity 10 orders of magnitude better than the
present result (2). Another possibility would be an NMR
experiment (207Pb is a spin- 1
2 nucleus.) Although the
sensitivity improvement is not as large in this case, the
NMR experiment does not require nanokelvin tempera-
tures.

PbTiO3 is ionic crystal consisting of Pb2+, Ti4+, and
O2− ions. Although the internal electric ﬁeld in ferro-
electric crystal is very large, the average ﬁeld acting on
each charged particle in the compound is zero (the so-
called Schiﬀ theorem, [14].) It means, that calculating
the EDM of the lead ion and multiplying it by the in-
ternal electric ﬁeld is not, strictly speaking, the correct
way to obtain the microscopic EDM Hamiltonian – the
lattice relaxes to compensate for the strong electric ﬁeld,
eﬀectively screening it out. The actual non-zero eﬀect

arises because of the ﬁnite size of ions and, in partic-
ular, due to the penetration of oxygen electrons inside
the Pb ion in PbO12 cluster (Pb2+ ion and its ﬁrst co-
ordination sphere.) In the ferroelectric state Pb ions are
shifted with respect to the central position in the cluster
by X = 0.47 ˚A [15], this shift explains the strong ferro-
electricity of PbTiO3. Wavefunctions of oxygen electrons
penetrate inside the Pb ion, and, because of the displace-
ment, create the electric ﬁeld gradient at the Pb nucleus.
Nuclear Schiﬀ moment interacts with this gradient, which
leads to the energy shift.

Similar eﬀect has been considered previously for
gadolinium garnets (Ref. [16]) where the ion displace-
ment was induced by the external electric ﬁeld. In the
above paper, electronic properties relevant to the prob-
lem were described in the framework of GdO8 cluster. In
the case of PbTiO3 we have PbO12 cluster, but for the
ﬁrst estimate this diﬀerence can, arguably, be neglected,
and we apply the formula obtained in [16] to our case:

The width of the NMR line is the central issue for any
precise NMR measurement with the principal limitation
coming from the homogeneous broadening. Since all the
electron spins are compensated in the compound, the
broadening is due to the magnetic dipole-dipole inter-
action of nuclear spins. The second moment of the line

It is possible to reduce the homogeneous broadening
by using samples grown to have reduced concentration of
magnetic isotopes. Removal of 47Ti and 49Ti should re-
duce the width (7) by 30%. Further reduction is possible
in the sample with depleted concentration of 207Pb. The

mainly determined by the typical events of 207Pb nuclei

shows an improvement of sensitivity to the Schiﬀ mo-
ment by 4 orders of magnitude, compared to the atomic
Hg experiment [3].

The spin-lattice relaxation is probably not a serious
issue. For the sample with the natural abundance of
isotopes the corresponding lifetime is about 1 sec [21].
We attribute this relaxation to the combined action of
magnetic interaction between 207Pb and 47,49Ti nuclei
and electric quadrupole interaction of 47,49Ti nuclei with
the lattice. If this is correct, the spin-lattice relaxation
time in the sample with no 47,49Ti nuclei must be much
larger than 1 sec.

Because of the substantial hysteresis in the ferroelec-
tric, the energy dissipation in experiments with the ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld reversal can be a serious issue. On the
other hand, in the experiment suggested here there are
no external electric ﬁeld reversals. The external electric
ﬁeld creates a residual polarization in the ferroelectric
and is then switched oﬀ. The polarized sample is then
rotated, eﬀectively reversing the internal electric ﬁeld.

Another approach, which looks even more promising
than the NMR one, is to measure the magnetization in-
duced by the external electric ﬁeld, as was suggesed by
Lamoreaux [13] to measure the electron EDM in gadolin-
ium garnets. Compared to the electron EDM case, we
immediately lose 3 orders of magnitude just on the nu-
clear magneton vs the Bohr magneton ratio. However,
the eﬀective electric ﬁeld in ferroelectric is 4 orders of
magnitude larger than the external electric ﬁeld in the
gadolinium garnet experiment. Additionally, it should
be possible to cool the nuclear spins in PbTiO3 down to
10 nK, whereas the lowest experimental temperature in
gadolinium garnet is probably limited to about 1 K (in
both cases, the lowest temperature is determined by the
spin freezing); the last arguement wins about 8 orders of
magnitude in sensitivity.

Let us perform more accurate estimates. 207Pb nuclear

Here n is the number density of 207Pb nuclei, µ is their
magnetic moment; ∆ǫ is given by Eq. (4). In metals, tem-
peratures below 1 nK have been reported to be achieved
by magnetic cooling of spins (e.g., see review [22].) Mag-
netic cooling in insulators is not as developed; however,
10−6 K has been achieved in the
the temperature T
studies of nuclear magnetic ordering in CaF2 [22]. Nu-
clear spins in PbTiO3 freeze at suﬃciently lower tem-
perature, forming a spin glass state. The freezing tem-
perature Tf is determined by the spin-spin interaction,
therefore,

ment predicted by the standard model, S

Similarly to the NMR experiment discussed above, en-
ergy dissipation from the external electric ﬁeld reversals
can be a serious issue. This problem can be avoided by
switching oﬀ the external electric ﬁeld altogether, and
rotating the electrically polarized sample to eﬀectively
reverse the internal electric ﬁeld. With this kind of “rota-
tional reversal” paramagnetic impurities (electronic para-
magnetism) can be a source of potentially dangerous sys-
tematics, so the sample should be prepared to be free
of such impurities. Nonmagnetic impurities do not con-
tribute to these systematics.

To summarize, we have suggested two types of exper-
iments, NMR and macroscopic magnetometry, in solid
PbTiO3 to search for the nuclear Schiﬀ moment of 207Pb.
Both kinds of experiments promise substantial improve-
ment over the presently achieved sensitivities. Statis-
tical considerations show that the magnetometry experi-
ment can oﬀer up to 10 orders of magnitude improvement
over the present sensitivity to the nuclear Schiﬀ moment
(199Hg experiment [3].) With this improvement, the sen-
sitivity is 4 orders of magnitude better than the value of
the nuclear Schiﬀ moment expected from the standard
model, [4, 5, 7, 24]. Such signiﬁcant enhancement is due
to the strong internal electric ﬁeld of the ferroelectric,
as well as due to the possibility to cool the nuclear-spin
subsystem in the compound down to nanokelvin temper-
atures. The NMR-type experiment does not require such
low temperatures, but oﬀers smaller improvement in sen-
sitivity – about 4 orders of magnitude when compared to
the 199Hg experiment [3].

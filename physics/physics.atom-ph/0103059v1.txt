We calculate the light-induced collisional loss of laser-cooled and trapped magnesium atoms for
detunings up to 50 atomic linewidths to the red of the 1S0-1P1 cooling transition. We evaluate loss
rate coeﬃcients due to both radiative and nonradiative state-changing mechanisms for temperatures
at and below the Doppler cooling temperature. We solve the Schr¨odinger equation with a complex
potential to represent spontaneous decay, but also give analytic models for various limits. Vibrational
structure due to molecular photoassociation is present in the trap loss spectrum. Relatively broad
1Σu state occurs for detunings larger than about 10 atomic
structure due to absorption to the Mg2
linewidths. Much sharper structure, especially evident at low temperature, occurs even at smaller
1Πg absorption, which is weakly allowed due to relativistic retardation
detunings due to of Mg2
corrections to the forbidden dipole transition strength. We also perform model studies for the other
alkaline earth species Ca, Sr, and Ba and for Yb, and ﬁnd similar qualitative behavior as for Mg.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Background

Laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms has re-
cently opened many new research areas in atomic physics.
One can cool a gas of neutral atoms in magneto-optical
traps (MOT) down to temperatures of 1 mK and be-
low, and obtain densities up to 1012 atoms/cm3. Evap-
orative cooling methods have allowed the cooling of al-
kali species to much lower temperatures below 1 µK so
that Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) occurs. Binary
atomic collisions play an important role in the physics
of cold trapped atomic gases, and have been widely in-
vestigated [1]. One of the ﬁrst cold collisional process
to be studied is the heating and loss of trapped atoms
which result from tuning laser light to near-resonance
with the atomic cooling transition [2]. Here we take near-
resonance, or small-detuning, to mean detuning ∆ up to
50 natural linewidths to the red of atomic resonance.

Studies of small-detuning trap loss, extensively re-
viewed by Weiner et al. [1], have mainly concentrated on
alkali atoms [3], for which it has been very diﬃcult to de-
velop quantitative theoretical models to compare with ex-
periment. This is because alkali atoms have extensive hy-
perﬁne structure, and thus the number of collision chan-
nels is simply too large for accurate theoretical modeling.
It has even been diﬃcult to estimate the relative weight
of the diﬀerent possible loss processes. Although one
can develop simpliﬁed models, these are diﬃcult to test

1

adequately with complex alkali systems. On the other
hand, trap loss photoassociation spectra in alkali systems
for large detuning can be modeled quite accurately [4–6].
This is because the underlying molecular physics of alkali
dimer molecules is well-known, and the spectra are deter-
mined by isolated molecular vibrational-rotational levels,
for which the photoassociation line shapes can be well-
characterized even in the presence of hyperﬁne structure.
Quantitative analysis of such spectra have permitted the
determination of scattering lengths for ground state colli-
sions [1]. These scattering lengths are critical parameters
for BEC studies.

Alkaline earth cooling and trapping have recently been
of considerable experimental interest. Trap loss collisions
have been studied in a Sr MOT [7], and intercombination
line cooling of Sr has resulted in temperatures below 1 µK
and raised the prospects of BEC of Sr [8–11]. Ca is of
interest for possible applications as an optical frequency
standard [12–16], and photoassociation spectroscopy in a
Ca MOT has been reported [17]. Intercombination line
cooling has also been reported for Yb [18,19], which we
have included in our discussion because of its similarity
in structure to alkaline earth atoms.

Alkaline earth species provide an excellent testing
ground for cold collision theories, especially given the
rapidly developing experimental interest in the subject.
Since the main isotopes of alkaline earth atoms have no
hyperﬁne structure, the number of collision channels be-
comes low enough to allow theoretical calculations even
in the small detuning trap loss regime. Consequently,

this paper presents theoretical predictions for small de-
tuning trap loss spectra in cold and trapped Mg gas in the
presence of near-resonant weak laser light tuned near the
1P1 atomic transition, and discusses the nature
1S0 →
of similar processes for Ca, Sr, Ba, and Yb. This work
extends our previous note on Mg trap loss [20] to other
species and lower temperatures, and shows the relation
between small detuning trap loss and photoassociation
theory. It is necessary to include spontaneous emission
in modeling trap loss collision dynamics because of the
long time scale of cold collisions. In addition, relativis-
tic retardation eﬀects play a prominent role at small de-
tunings by allowing transitions to the dipole forbidden
1Πg state, which exhibits resolved vibrational structure,
especially at very low temperature. Although we treat
the long-range molecular interactions accurately, the po-
tential energy curves and coupling matrix elements for
the dimer molecules in the short-range region of chemical
bonding are not suﬃciently well-known to determine all
aspects of trap loss. Therefore, we examine the uncer-
tainties associated with the unknown phases developed
in the short-range region of chemical bonding, and show
which features are robust with respect to such uncertain-
ties and which must be measured or later determined
from improved theory.

B. Trap loss collisions

Light-induced trap loss takes place as a molecular pro-
cess. Two colliding cold atoms form a quasimolecule,
and their motion can be described in terms of the elec-
tronic (Born-Oppenheimer) potentials of the molecular
dimer with light-induced transitions between the molec-
ular states. We consider only red detuning, which excites
attractive potentials at long range. Such potentials sup-
port a number of bound vibrational states.

Figure 1 schematically indicates the nature of the trap
loss process in a weak radiation ﬁeld. An excitation laser
with energy hν is tuned a few atomic linewidths below
the atomic transition energy hν0. The ground
and
quasimolecular electronic states are thus cou-
excited
pled resonantly by the laser at some long-range Condon
radius RC, where the photon energy matches the diﬀer-
ence between the excited and ground potential energy
p
curves. The excited state decays to a loss channel
i
|
due to interactions at short range. The fully quantum
mechanical description in Ref. [21] shows that the overall
probability Ppg of a trap loss collision can be factored as
follows:

g
|

i

Ppg = PpeJeg.

(1)

Here Jeg represents an excitation-transfer probability
which is proportional to the scattering ﬂux that reaches
the short range region near Rp due to long-range exci-
tation near the Condon point followed by propagation

on the excited state to the short-range region. Ppe rep-
resents the probability of a transition from the excited
state to the loss channel at short range during a single
cycle of oscillation through the short-range region.

Figure 1 indicates the qualitative behavior of the trans-
fer function Jeg versus detuning ∆. At very small detun-
ing of a few atomic linewidths Jeg becomes very small if
there is a high probability of spontaneous emission dur-
ing transit from the outer to inner regions. At suﬃciently
large detuning Jeg exhibits resonance structure due to
the bound vibrational levels in the excited state poten-
tial, where the vibrational period is much shorter than
the decay time [22]. This is the domain of photoassocia-
tion to individual vibrational levels. Section III C below
will show simple analytic formulas for Jeg that apply in
these two limiting cases of small detuning with fast decay
or isolated photoassociation lines. These formulas show
how Jeg can in turn be factored as

Jeg = JeePeg,

(2)

where Peg represents the probability of excitation from
the ground to excited state in the outer zone near the
Condon point, and Jee represents an excited state trans-
fer function between the long-range outer excitation zone
and the short-range zone. The factorization in Eq. (2) is
also schematically indicated in Fig. 1.

Each of the factors in Eqs. (1) and (2) can be af-
fected by unknown phases associated with the short-
range molecular physics of the dimer molecules. (1) Peg
is sensitive to the asymptotic phase of the ground state
wave function.
(2) Vibrational resonance structure in
Jeg is sensitive to the position and widths of vibrational
features. (3) Ppe is sensitive to St¨uckelberg oscillations
in short-range curve crossing probabilities. These eﬀects
are discussed in detail in Secs. II D and II E. The overall
eﬀect of such sensitivities will depend on the temperature
and the alkaline earth species.

There are two possible inner zone loss processes char-
acterized by Ppe: the state change (SC) and radiative es-
cape (RE) mechanisms, both represented schematically
by the loss channel p in Fig. 1. In the SC process the

2

excited state couples to another molecular state near
a short-range crossing point Rp, and population trans-
fer between them is possible. The products of the col-
lision emerge on a state that correlates asymptotically
with other atomic states of lower energy, such as 3P+1S,
thereby releasing a large amount of kinetic energy to the
separating atoms. In RE the excited state can decay by
spontaneous emission after the atoms have been acceler-
ated towards each other on the excited state potential.
The ground state atoms then separate with this gain in
kinetic energy. If enough kinetic energy has been gained
to exceed the trap depth, this is a loss process (early de-
cay after insuﬃcient acceleration only leads to radiative
heating). Here Rp represents the distance at which the
atoms have received suﬃcient acceleration to be lost from
the trap. Any emission with R < Rp leads to trap loss.
In this paper we use the fully quantum complex po-
tential method of Ref. [21] and do not resort to semiclas-
sical methods (with one exception), although semiclas-
sical concepts are often useful for interpretation. Our
quantum methods are fully capable of describing the
s-wave limit and the quantum threshold properties of
the extremely low collision energies near or below the
critical temperature for BEC. We describe the sponta-
neous emission processes with a complex potential, and
solve the corresponding time-independent multichannel
Schr¨odinger equation in the molecular electronic state
basis. This takes any vibrational state structure into ac-
count automatically without the need to calculate wave
functions or Franck-Condon factors, but limits our study
to weak laser ﬁelds only, where only a single photon is ex-
changed with the ﬁeld. Typical cooling lasers are strong
and detuned only a few linewidths. By alternating with
a weaker probe laser one can access the particular range
of detuning and intensity that we study. Future studies
are needed to address the eﬀects of strong laser ﬁelds and
the consequent revision of our results due to saturation
and power broadening [23,24].

We also include rotational states into our model, which
for the molecular ground state correspond to the partial
waves of a standard scattering problem (angular momen-
tum quantum number l). The symmetry of spinless al-
kaline earth dimers permits only even partial waves. It
should be pointed out that for near-resonant light the
Condon point is at relatively large distances. This means
that although the collision energy is low, one needs to go
to relatively large l before the ground state centrifugal
barrier stops the quasimolecule from reaching RC . We
correct here some mistakes that we discovered in the sum
over partial waves in Ref. [20].

The probe laser can be tuned over a wide range from
a few to many atomic linewidths. For suﬃciently large
detuning the rotational structure becomes sharp, and it
should be possible to resolve the vibrational and rota-
tional states. However, even at 27 GHz detuning, rota-
1Σu photoassociation
tional features in the Ca2
spectrum are only partially resolved [17]. Photoassocia-
tion studies can yield precise information on the molecu-

1Σg →

lar potentials. Also, the photoassociation line shapes are
sensitive to the near-threshold ground state wave func-
tion, especially if it has nodes in the region swept by
the detuning-dependent Condon point. Analysis of such
data would hopefully give a value for the s-wave scat-
tering length for Mg or other alkaline earth species, and
consequently determine whether a stable Bose-Einstein
condensate is possible.

In this paper we present the calculated estimates for
trap loss rate coeﬃcients in Mg at temperatures around
and below the Doppler temperature. The contributions
from diﬀerent mechanisms and states are identiﬁed and
compared. We also calculate predictions for other al-
kaline earth atoms and Yb by combining the appropri-
ate atomic properties with model molecular potentials.
Sec. II presents in detail the atomic data, molecular po-
tentials, and laser couplings used for Mg and other alka-
line earth atoms. Sec. III describes our theoretical ap-
proach. The results for Mg are given in Sec. IV and for
the other atoms (Sr, Ca, Ba, Yb) in Sec. V. Finally we
present some conclusions in Sec. VI.

II. THE MOLECULAR PHYSICS OF ALKALINE
EARTH DIMER MOLECULES

A. Alkaline earth atomic structure

Table I gives the basic atomic data for the alkaline
earth atoms and Yb, which has an electronic structure
similar to the Group II elements. The major isotopes
have no hyperﬁne structure, except for Be. Alkaline-
earth atoms have a 1S0 ground state, and excited 1P1
and 3P1 states that are optically connected to the ground
state, the latter weakly. Figure 2 sketches the energy lev-
els of the Group II atoms. The 1,3P ﬁrst excited states
are the most important for laser cooling. The 1,3D states
shift downwards as the atomic number increases. For
Mg the 1,3D states are above the 1,3P states. For Ca
and Sr they are between the 3P and the 1P states, and
for Ba the 1,3D states are below the 1,3P states. In laser
cooling one uses typically the 1S0-1P1 transition, which
is the situation studied in this paper. For Mg this re-
quires a UV laser source, and for the heavier elements
requires repumping to recycle atoms that decay to lower
levels. The weak 1S0-3P1 intercombination transition has
a very narrow linewidth, and is within the optical range.
Thus alkaline earth atoms are good candidates for opti-
cal atomic clocks when cooled to low temperatures. For
clock applications we need to understand their laser cool-
ing properties, including the magnitude and nature of
laser-induced collisional trap loss.

Beryllium is not likely to be a serious candidate for
laser cooling. It is toxic, has a very short wavelength cool-
ing transition, and the intercombination “clock” transi-
tion is so weak as to be eﬀectively forbidden. Therefore,
we will not consider Be in the rest of this paper.

Because of the lack of hyperﬁne structure the ba-
sic laser cooling mechanism for alkaline earth atoms is
Doppler cooling, for which the temperature limit TD, de-
ﬁned in the caption of Table I, is set by the linewidth
Γat of the cooling transition (widths in this paper are ex-
pressed in energy units, so that the decay rate is Γat/¯h).
The lifetime of the alkaline earth 1P1 state is between
1.8 and 8.4 ns, giving a Doppler-cooling limit between
2.1 and 0.45 mK for the elements in Table I. On the
other hand the 3P1 state has a long lifetime with Doppler-
cooling limits in the nK range. This can be compared to
the photon recoil limit TR, deﬁned in the Table caption;
Table I shows that TR is between 0.2 and 4 µK. Thus the
recoil limit is above the intercombination line Doppler
cooling limit for Mg and Ca, nearly coincident with it for
Sr, and below it for Ba and Yb.

Although Sisyphus cooling and magnetic trapping is
not available for 1S0 atoms as it is for alkali atoms, in-
tercombination line cooling is possible for some Group II
species. This has been used to cool Sr to
400 nK with
relatively high phase space density > 0.1 [8,9]. If com-
bined with far oﬀ-resonant optical traps and evaporative
cooling it may become possible to obtain Bose-Einstein
condensation with optical methods alone.

B. Alkaline earth dimer molecular structure

Figure 3 shows the lowest electronic potentials for
Mg2 [28]. There are only two states with attractive long-
range potentials correlating with 1P1 + 1S0 that can be
resonantly coupled to the ground state by laser light,
u and 1Πg. Both states oﬀer the possibil-
namely 1Σ+
ity for the SC and RE mechanisms. When comparing
Figs. 2 and 3 one can see that Mg is special. For other
alkaline earth atoms the molecular state picture is fur-
ther complicated by the atomic D states below the 1P1
state. This increases the number of molecular states and
thus the number of energetically available exit channels.
The small number of molecular states is one reason we
have chosen Mg as the basis for our studies. Theoretical
calculations require precise information about the molec-
ular potentials and couplings over a wide range of inter-
atomic distance. Ab initio calculations of ground and
excited molecular potentials are also available for Sr [29]
and Ba [30].

While working on the manuscript we received new ab
initio data on Mg2 from E. Czuchaj, including both im-
proved potential curves and spin-orbit couplings [31]. Al-
though the new data diﬀer to some extent from the re-
sults of Stevens and Krauss [28] because of improved cal-
culations of electron correlation eﬀects, we do not expect
that use of the new data would lead to any strong mod-
iﬁcation of our basic results, which should be viewed as
qualitative model calculations for the reasons to be dis-
cussed in the following sections.

FIG. 3. The molecular states of Mg2 in atomic units cor-
responding to the asymptotic atomic states 1S0+1P1 and
1S0+3P0,1,2 [28]; the zero of energy is at the ground state
1S0+1S0 asymptote. There are four states correlating with
each asymptote, of which two are attractive and two are re-
pulsive at large R, where the system is expected to be resonant
with the laser ﬁeld.

The linewidth of the excited 1Σu state depends on the

1S+1P

1S+3P

5

interatomic distance R with a magnitude on the order of
twice the atomic linewidth. Thus the vibrational levels of
the 1Σu state near the 1S+1P dissociation limit overlap
strongly, and one does not expect to resolve them. One
1Σg
interesting point is that the dipole-forbidden 1Πg −
transition becomes allowed at large R due to retardation
corrections. This means that the 1Πg state can be ex-
cited at RC , but the spontaneous emission probability
goes down quickly as R decreases. Consequently, 1Πg
vibrational states near the dissociation limit have nar-
row emission linewidths. Thus the assumption that the
vibrational states overlap strongly and can not be re-
solved at detunings of a few linewidths is not necessarily
valid. One must determine if resolvable features persist
when one sums over all involved rotational states/partial
waves, and takes the energy average over a thermal dis-
tribution. We show that one can indeed see vibrational
structure, especially if the temperature is well below the
1S0-1P1 Doppler limit. As mentioned above, this is by
no means impossible, if one does the cooling using the
1S0-3P1 transition.

C. Long-range properties of states correlating with
1P1+1S0 atoms

There are four molecular states correlating with
1P1+1S0 atoms: two long-range attractive states, 1Σ+
u
and 1Πg, and two long-range repulsive states, 1Σ+
g and
1Πu. Here long-range means that R is large compared to
the short-range region of chemical bonding and van der
Waals interactions shown in Fig. 3 so that the potential
is determined by the ﬁrst-order dipole-dipole-interaction
0 for the 1Σ and 1Π states, re-
d2
with C3 =
spectively. Here d0 is the z-component of the atomic
transition dipole matrix element, which is related to the
atomic linewidth Γat and the reduced wavelength of the
0 = 3λ3Γat/4. The

tardation corrections are [32]

D. Ground state

The ground-state van der Waals potential varies at
long-range as R−6 and is essentially ﬂat for the range
of Condon points we consider. The energy-normalized
ground state scattering wave function for collisional mo-
mentum ¯hk∞ and partial wave l has the long-range form

We deﬁne the collisional energy as ε = ¯h2k2
∞/(2µ). The
short-range potentials are not suﬃciently well-known for
alkaline earth dimers to determine accurately the scatter-
ing phase shifts ηl(k∞). Therefore, our calculations will
have to be model calculations. However, we test the sen-
sitivity of our trap loss spectra to the unknown phases,

and show that this is not a serious limitation. There are
two reasons for this. One is that the ground state poten-
tial is ﬂat in the long-range region, and the amplitude of
Ψ(R, l, k∞) has its asymptotic value in Eq. (7) indepen-
2 (2µC6/¯h2)1/4 [34,35];
dent of R as long as R > x0 = 1
the use of x0 (or a closely related length) as an appropri-
ate length scale for van der Waals potentials is described
in the Appendix of Ref. [6]. The condition RC ≫
x0 is
easily satisﬁed in our case. Second, at the Doppler limit
1P1 cooling, a number of partial waves l
TD for 1S0 →
contribute to trap loss in our detuning range (1-50 Γat).
We demonstrate in Sec. IV A that a sum over l removes
the dependence on the short-range potential.

Our trap loss spectra for s-wave scattering at the low
temperatures available via intercombination line cooling
will be sensitive to the actual scattering length A0 of the
ground 1Σ+
g potential. However, we demonstrate a sim-
ple scaling relationship that will allow our low T s-wave
results to be scaled to any value of the scattering length.
We may expect that the 1Σ+
g scattering length can be
determined from one or two-color photoassociation spec-
tra, as has been done for alkali species [1]. However, such
analysis will require an accurate C6 coeﬃcient and for
optimum results needs a reasonably accurate short-range
potential as well.

E. Excited state short-range potentials

Trap loss spectra depend strongly on the excited state

short-range potential structure in three ways:

(1) The curve crossings leading to SC trap loss occur
at short range, and determine Ppe. In a Landau-Zener
interpretation,

Vpe(Rp), vp, Dp are the respective coupling matrix ele-
ment, speed, and slope diﬀerence at the Rp crossing, and
βJ ′ is a semiclassical phase angle [36]:

where R0i and ¯hki(R, J ′) are the respective inner clas-
sical turning point at zero energy and local momentum
for state i = e or p. The attractive singlet potentials
may have one or more crossings with repulsive potentials
from lower-lying states, e.g., those correlating to 3P+1S.
Thus the number, positions of crossings and the coupling
between states with crossing potentials are important for
the magnitude of Ppe. Although we can make reasonable
estimates for Λ, the phase angle βJ ′ is sensitive to details
of the potentials and can only be calculated accurately if
very accurate potentials are available [37].

6

(2) The vibrational structure in the trap loss spectra
depends on both short and long-range potentials. The
spacing between the vibrational levels given by Eq. (6)
depends only on the long-range potentials, but the exact
positions of the levels in Eq. (5) are determined by the
short-range potentials in the region of chemical bonding
(through the vD parameter). Thus, the magnitude of the
vibrational spacings in our model calculations will be cor-
rect, whereas the actual positions can only be determined
by measurement.

(3) The short-range SC process also contributes to the
width of vibrational features in the trap loss spectra [38].
Depending on species, temperature, and detuning, the
widths may be primarily determined by natural or ther-
mal broadening or by the predissociation decay rate re-
lated to Ppe. However, we are able to place approximate
bounds on the magnitude of Ppe. Sections III C, IV, and
V discuss the contributions to feature widths and show
that natural and thermal broadening tends to be domi-
nant at small detuning, whereas SC broadening may be-
come dominant at large detuning.

The available data on short-range potentials varies
among the Group II elements. Ab initio potentials are
available for Mg [28,31]. The structure of the molecular
potentials is fairly simple because only states correlat-
ing to 1P+1S (4 states) and 3P+1S atoms (4 states) are
present (see Fig. 3) and the potentials provide quali-
tative data for possible SC mechanisms. On the other
hand, Ca, Sr and Ba have a very complex short-range
structure, because of large ﬁne structure splittings in the
triplet states, and the states correlating to 1D+1S and
3D+1S coming into play. For example, Boutassetta et
al. [29] and Allouche et al. [30] calculated the short-range
potentials for Sr and Ba respectively, but the large num-
ber of states (e.g., 38 states for Ba) makes it excessively
complicated to treat the short-range SC mechanism even
qualitatively.

The coupling between the singlet and triplet states at
short-range is due to spin-orbit couplings. The exact
magnitude of the couplings is unknown for all Group
II elements, but can be estimated using Table A1 of
Ref. [39], which relates the coupling matrix elements to
3P0 ﬁne structure splitting. This approxima-
the 3P2−
tion ignores any R-dependence of the spin-orbit matrix
elements due to chemical bonding. The ﬁne structure
splitting of the 3P state increases with atomic number
(see Table I).

We have opted for Mg as a model system, because
short-range potentials are available. Each singlet state
with attractive potential couples to only one triplet state
in the inner zone. Thus the SC trap loss problem for
Mg decouples into two three-state calculations, one for
the 1Σ+
u and one for the 1Πg excited state. For Mg we
provide qualitatively correct SC trap loss spectra and
even give some quantitative estimates.

In the case of the other Group II elements and Yb,
we treat their complicated inner zone physics as one ef-
fective crossing, that is, we use three-state calculations

based on the Mg-model, and explore the eﬀects of mass,
radiative properties, and coupling strength (size of spin-
orbit splitting) in these model calculations. Thus we do
not use the ab initio potentials of Refs. [29,30] discussed
in the paragraph above, because even if we were to in-
clude all the curves, there would still be uncertainties
associated with unknown phases and unknown coupling
matrix elements. Rather, our goal is to indicate qualita-
tive diﬀerences in magnitude and spectral shapes among
the various species. We trust that these will be helpful
in providing guidance for future experimental and the-
oretical studies of these systems. As we discuss in Sec-
tion III B, our calculation of the excitation-transfer coef-
ﬁcient κ will be to a large extent independent of details of
the complicated short-range molecular physics and curve
crossings.

F. Molecular rotational structure and coupling to
the laser ﬁeld

The full three-dimensional treatment of the collision
of a 1S atom coupled to a 1P atom by a light ﬁeld is
worked out in Ref. [40]. We adapt this treatment to our
simpliﬁed model with molecular Hund’s case (a) transi-
tions between two molecular states with the usual rota-
tional branch structure. The angular momentum J ′′ in
the ground state can only be that of molecular axis rota-
tion, J ′′ = l′′ with projection m′′ on a space-ﬁxed axis.
The excited rotational levels in a Hund’s case (a) molec-
ular basis for a 1Σ+
u or 1Πg state do not have mechanical
rotation l′ as a good quantum number but instead the
total angular momentum J ′ with space projection M ′.
The three possible transition branches have J ′ = l′′ + B,
where the branch labels P, Q, and R respectively desig-
nate the cases B = -1, 0, and 1. The quasi-molecule
ground state can couple to the 1Σ+
u state only by P
and R branches, but to the 1Πg state by P, Q, and R
branches. All potentials have a centrifugal term added,
n(n + 1)/(2µR2), depending on ground state n = l′′ or
excited states n = J ′ = l′′ + B.

G. Model potentials for Mg

ing point of σ = 6.23 a0. This potential has a scat-
95 a0 for the 24Mg reduced mass of

23.985042/2 atomic mass units. The scattering length
A0 is determined from the k

Since the excited ab initio potentials of Ref. [28] do not
permit a quantitative calculation of spectroscopic accu-
racy, for the reasons given in Sec. II E, the speciﬁc forms
of the short-range (sr) excited-state potentials are not
important for our purposes of modeling the qualitative
structure and magnitude of the collisional loss. How-
ever, it is important to retain the correct long-range form.
Therefore for simplicity in the calculations and because
we want to model the other alkaline earth systems to ex-
plore the eﬀect of diﬀerent C3, Γat, λ and mass, we have

The SC from 1Πg to 3Σg takes place about 1.5 a0 out-
side and 0.019 a.u. above the minimum of the 1Πg state
potential well. With C6 = 81 a.u. we have a model of the
crossing where the corresponding values are: 1.0 a0 and
0.019 a.u. The diﬀerence in slope of the crossing poten-
tials is 0.030 a.u. for the ab initio potentials and 0.037
a.u. for the model.

The coupling between the crossing states are approx-
u -3Πu and
imated using Table A1 of Ref. [39]. The 1Σ+

g matrix elements are ζ/√2 and ζ/2, respectively,
10−4 a.u. is 2/3 of the atomic 3P2-

potential calculation described below.

Since we will use a semiclassical method to determine
the Ppe factor for the RE process via the 1Σ+
u state (see
Sec. III D below), we do not need an explicit probe chan-
nel for RE. However, we introduce a probe channel to
simulate RE in order to show that the same Jeg factor
in Eq. (1) applies for both SC and RE processes, irre-
spective of the choice of the short-range Rp. Since we
may take any form we like for a RE probe state, we use
a probe state potential which crosses the excited state
at a distance up, where the kinetic energy gained by the
collision pair is 1 K, corresponding to a trap depth of 0.5
K. The RE probe potential has a repulsive inner wall

H. Model potentials for Ca, Sr, Ba and Yb

A0| ≪
|

Since the diﬀerent ground state values of C6 and inner
potential shape make no diﬀerence for these model stud-
ies, for the reasons given in Sec. II G, we take the same
ground state Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential, Eq. (13), as
in the Mg case to model the other alkaline earth ground
states, and only change the reduced mass. This proce-
dure yields respective model scattering lengths of 67 a0,
-65 a0, -41 a0, and 97 a0 for 40Ca, 88Sr, 138Ba, and 174Yb.
Thus,

RC in all model cases.

The long-range of the excited state potentials for Ca,
Sr, Ba and Yb is still exact, using the data from Table
I with the form in Eq. (3). Due to lack of accurate ex-
cited state short-range molecular potentials and because
of their more complicated structure, we model the trap
loss for Ca, Sr, Ba and Yb by scaling the potentials from
the Mg model Eqs. (15) and (16). The well depth ǫ of
the 1Σ+
u and 1Πg potentials are scaled by the size of the
singlet-triplet states splitting compared to that splitting
in Mg, e.g.:

ǫCa = ǫMg

E(1P, Ca)
E(1P, Mg)

E(3P, Ca)
E(3P, Mg)

.

−
−

(19)

The short-range structure is treated as one eﬀective
crossing. The probe states are qualitatively like those in
the Mg model. The position (in energy) of the crossing
between the 1Πg and probe state potentials is scaled as
above. The 1Σ+
u and probe state potentials come very
close at the inner wall of the 1Σ+
u potential around the
classical turning point Ve(u) = ε.

The spin-orbit coupling constant ζ scales with the spin-
orbit splitting of the 3P atomic states. We use the same
deﬁnition of the matrix elements as for Mg. The Landau-
Zener adiabaticity parameter 2πΛ in Eq. (8) for Ba and
Yb is larger than unity, leading to a modiﬁed shape of the
short-range adiabatic potentials and very small Ppe,SC.
Thus for Ba the 1Σ+
u -probe state coupling and for Yb
the 1Πg and the 1Σ+
u -probe state couplings have been
reduced by about a factor 5 to obtain values of Ppe,SC
close to unity, in order to test the limit of very strong
broadening of the vibrational structure. We believe this
limit is physically more realistic. The variety of crossings
in these systems might lead to a strong SC process.

III. COMPLEX POTENTIAL CLOSE COUPLED
CALCULATIONS

A. Description of method

The weak ﬁeld approximation assumed in this study
allows us to apply a complex potential method [21,41],
since re-excitation of any decayed quasimolecular popu-
lation can be ignored. Furthermore, the weak ﬁeld only
couples each ground-state partial wave to at most 3 rota-
tional states of the 1Σu or 1Πg state through the P, Q, or
R branches. However, in the weak ﬁeld the excited-state
rotational states do not couple further to other ground-
state partial waves. Therefore we can ignore any partial
wave ladder climbing. Thus, for each trap loss mecha-
nism we have three dressed states: a ground state g, an
excited state e, and a probe state, p. We solve the three-
channel, time-independent radial Schr¨odinger equation
for ground state collision energy ε, partial wave l = l′′,

choose the light intensity I low enough that the results

are in the weak ﬁeld limit where the Ppg =

to a standard intensity of I = 1 mW/cm2.

Spg|
|

We ﬁnd that we can make a change in the asymptotic
shape of the artiﬁcial probe potential to make the model
much more manageable computationally. The deep po-
tential well of the excited state and the large kinetic en-
ergy in the probe channel require a small stepsize in u
(λ∆u
0.005 a0). However, with the large range of u
≈
1500-3000 a0) a small ∆u increases the com-
(λumax ≈
putation time and may compromise the numerical sta-
bility. Therefore, we modify the probe state potential to
bring Vp(u) to a small negative value at intermediate and
asymptotic u. This results in a small asymptotic momen-
tum ¯hk in the probe channel, and allows us to gradually
increase the stepsize to λ∆u
0.5 a0 as u increases. The
coupling between the excited and probe states is turned
oﬀ exponentially before the change in Vp(u). The prob-
2 and Ppe are completely independent of
abilities
the asymptotic properties of the probe potential if there
are no asymptotic barriers. Since we have no centrifu-
gal potential in the asymptotic probe channel, there are
no asymptotic centrifugal barriers. The presence of such
barriers in our previously published model [20] resulted
in some errors at larger l′′ which we have now corrected
in the present model.

B. Factorization of trap loss probability

The factorization in Eq. (1) allows us to separate the
physics of the long-range excitation and the short-range
decay to the trap loss channel. Reference [21] shows how
to determine the short-range probability Ppe from a dif-
ferent coupled channels calculation where the complex
decay term
iΓ/2 in Eq. (21) is omitted. Since Ppe is
determined in a region near Rp where the local kinetic

nearly independent of ε over a wide range. Therefore, we

Here ε is taken above the threshold energy ∆ where the
e channel becomes open and Spe is deﬁned.

Our numerical calculations show, as expected, that Ppe
is independent of ε over a wide range, typically of ε/kB
from 0.3 mK to 300 mK at low J ′ and 3 mK to 300
mK at high J ′, and also independent of ∆ in our small
range of detuning. The Landau-Zener interpretation of
Ppe in Eq. (8) leads us to expect that Ppe will vary with
J ′. This variation should be stronger for the outer 1Πg-
3Σg crossing than for the inner 1Σu-3Πu crossing. For
the latter crossing, our calculations do give Ppe values
which vary slowly with J ′. We calculate Ppe(J ′ = 1)
to be 0.024, 0.44, 0.31, 0.34 and 0.64 for Mg, Ca, Sr,
Ba, and Yb respectively. These probabilities are all large
(order unity) except for the case of Mg. This qualitative
conclusion is likely to be robust, even though our model
calculations are only quite approximate.

In contrast to our results for the 1Σu-3Πu cross-
ing, Fig. 4 shows that the calculated Ppe(J ′) values for
the outer 1Πg-3Σg crossing indeed depend much more
strongly on J ′. A test of the Landau-Zener formula for
Mg shows that the result of Eq. (8) is indistinguishable
from the calculated line on the ﬁgure. The qualitative
feature of a dip in Ppe as it goes near zero for some J ′
is associated with the phase factor in the LZ formula,
Eq. (9). Since the speciﬁc J ′-range where this dip occurs
is sensitive to the potentials used [37], our model calcu-
lations can only be a qualitative guide even for Mg. The
relative values for the other species are also only qualita-
tive guides, since other curve crossings are also involved.

perhaps the largest, Ppe for the 1Πg SC process.

We can use Ppg and Ppe from the close coupling calcu-

where J ′ = l′′ + B. Jeg may be interpreted as the prob-
ability of reaching the short-range region due to opti-
cal excitation at long-range and propagation to short-
range, including return after multiple vibrations across
the short-range well. This interpretation follows from
the fact that one gets the total trap loss probability
Ppg(ε, l′′, B, ∆, I) by multiplying Jeg(ε, l′′, B, ∆, I) by the
probability Ppe(J ′) in Eq. (24) of a trap loss event in a
single complete cycle across the well.

Using Eq. (25), we can deﬁne an excitation-transfer

than we can the short-range SC probabilities. Thus, once
we have a better knowledge of these short-range proba-
bilities, either through measurements or through better
theoretical knowledge of potential curves and couplings,
we can multiply our κ coeﬃcients by
to get the
SC rate coeﬃcients.

C. Limiting cases of the excitation-transfer
probability

The attractive molecular potentials support molecu-
lar vibrational levels with vibrational quantum numbers
v, as described in Section II C. We can ﬁnd simple
analytic expressions for the excitation-transfer function
Jeg = JeePeg factored according to Eq. (2) for two limit-
ing cases: (1) strongly overlapping resonances where the
probability is large for spontaneous decay during a sin-
gle vibrational cycle, i.e., the level width is larger than
the level spacing, and (2) non-overlapping, or isolated,
resonances, where many vibrations occur during a vibra-
tional decay lifetime, i.e., the level width is much smaller
than the level spacing. For Group II species, 1Σu tran-
sitions at small detuning tend to be of the former type,
but never become fully isolated in the detuning range we
consider. On the other hand, 1Πg transitions tend to be
of the latter type unless the detuning is very small or the
SC probability is very large.

1. Small detuning and fast spontaneous decay

The quantum mechanical theory of the ﬁrst limiting
case for trap loss for small detuning and fast radiative
decay has been worked out in detail in Refs. [21,41,42,24],
where:

Clearly, we can also deﬁne a thermal average κ(∆, T )
analogous to that in Eq. (22), and deﬁne a thermal aver-
age

= K(∆, T )/κ(∆, T ).

The usefulness of the factorization in Eq. (1) is that it
allows us to deﬁne an excitation-transfer rate coeﬃcient
κ from which the inner zone SC probability has been re-
moved (however, see the discussion in Section III C 3 be-
low about how a large Ppe(J ′) may aﬀect the width of res-
onance features). We can predict much more conﬁdently
the properties of the long-range excitation and vibration

Note that the Landau-Zener expression for Peg in
Eq. (29) does not have the proper Wigner law threshold
behavior, since Jeg should be proportional to k at low col-
lision energy. However, our numerical Jeg will have the
proper Wigner law form. Note also that the quantum
mechanical calculations in Ref. [21,24,41,42] support this
semiclassical picture of localized excitation at the Con-
don point, not the delocalized excitation picture of the
Gallagher-Pritchard (GP) model [43], which for small de-
tuning predicts a dominant contribution to trap loss from
oﬀ-resonant excitation at distances much less than RC .
The GP model also does not satisfy the Wigner law at
low T . We defer detailed comparisons with semiclassical
theories to a future publication.

2. Non-overlapping resonances

The second limiting case is that of non-overlapping vi-
brational resonances, that is, the spacing hνv [see Eq. (6)]
between vibrational levels v is much larger than their to-
tal width Γv. This is typical of large detuning. Then

process, Pvp is a very weak function of energy as long
as the detuning is not too large, and we can take Pvp =
Ppe, where Ppe is the energy-independent SC probability
discussed in Sec. III B. In the weak-ﬁeld limit, Γvg is very
small in relation to Γv,rad, and we can ignore it (that is,
there is no power broadening).

This looks just like the Landau-Zener result in Eq. (8),
except that the asymptotic speed v∞ appears in the de-
nominator instead of vC [34], and the correct quantum
phase appears in the sine factor instead of a semiclassical
phase.

3. Contributions to the linewidths

The expression, Eq. (28), for Jeg in the limit of small
detuning and fast decay does not depend in any way on
the short-range SC probability. However, in the expres-
sion for Jeg in the isolated resonance limit, the width Γv
in the Jee factor, Eq. (33), does depend on Ppe through
the contribution of Γvp = ¯hνvPpe. As long as Γvp is small
compared to Γv,rad, the total width Γv is determined pri-
marily by Γv,rad, and the shape of trap loss spectral lines
will still be nearly independent of Ppe. However, if Γvp
makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the total width, the
long-range excitation-transfer function Jeg will show ad-
ditional broadening dependent on the magnitude of Ppe.
The total radiative decay width Γv,rad can be calcu-
lated from the long-range form of the decay rates in
Eqs. (4), using the excellent semiclassical approxima-
v(Γ(u)/v(u))λdu, where the
tion [47],
semiclassical integral is over a complete vibrational cy-
H
cle. When RC < λ, we can use the lead term in the
expansion of Γ(u) in u in Eqs. (4), so that

where a3 is deﬁned after Eq. (5) and ΓC (1Πg) is evalu-
ated at the outer turning point of the vibration, which is
almost the same as the Condon point.

For the detuning range we consider, the radiative width
of 1Σu levels, 2Γat, is much larger than Γvp, which can
be calculated from Eq. (32) using the probabilities listed
Γv,rad so that the shape of 1Σu

features (that is, their spacings and widths) should be
well-determined in our calculations.

Figure 5 shows Γv,rad and Γvp for 1Πg features for Mg,
Ca, and Sr. In our detuning range, Γv,rad ≫
Γvp for Mg.
Thus, the shape of Mg 1Πg features should also be well-
determined in our calculations. On the other hand, for
Ca and Sr, the Γvp is larger due to the larger Ppe. Γvp
increases as ∆5/6 due to the νv factor in Eq. (32), and be-
comes larger than Γv,rad near ∆ = 5Γat in our model for
Sr and near 20Γat for Ca. Thus, we can expect predisso-
ciation broadening of 1Πg features to become observable
for Ca or Sr at relatively small detunings. Measurements
of such widths could lead to experimental information
about Ppe for the 1Πg state. On the other hand, our
calculated model line shapes should only be viewed as a
qualitative guide in a region where Γvp ≫

Γv,rad.

culating the thermally averaged rate. The main contribu-
tion to Pdecay comes from the long-range region where the
potential is determined by its analytic long-range form.
The Pdecay probability is insensitive to collision energy
and detuning. In the detuning range ∆/Γat from 1 to 50
and for a collision energy of kBTD, we ﬁnd that Pdecay
ranges from 0.157 to 0.144 for Mg, 0.103 to 0.100 for Ca,
0.147 to 0.142 for Sr, 0.113 to 0.110 for Ba, and 0.149 to
0.145 for Yb. These hardly change at all at a collision
energy of kBTD/1000, for example, changing to 0.105 to
0.100 for Ca.

We have also used a calculation with an artiﬁcial probe
state crossing the excited state potential at Rp (Rp ≈
150 a0 for our Mg model for J ′ = 1), as described in
Sec. II G, to calculate the excitation-transfer function Jeg
appropriate to the RE process. We ﬁnd, as expected,
that the numerical Jeg function calculated this way is
very nearly the same as the one calculated using the SC
Rp at much shorter range. For our detuning range the
radiative contribution to the total width Γv of 1Σu levels
is much larger than contribution due to predissociation
to the SC channel.

We expect that our radiative escape trap loss calcu-
lations are reliable in magnitude, since only long-range
properties are relevant in determining both Jeg and
Pdecay. Therefore, in the next Section we can conﬁdently
give absolute magnitudes for the RE contribution to the
total trap loss rate coeﬃcient K(∆, T ) for all alkaline
earth atoms we study here.

IV. RESULTS

A. Trap loss for Mg at T = TD

D. Radiative escape calculations

The calculation of the RE trap loss rate coeﬃcient fol-
lows the factorization procedure in Eq. (1) as for the
SC process. The RE loss is not due to a single curve
crossing, but rather to excited state emission from the
distance range R < Rp = λup, where up is the point for
which a kinetic-energy increase of 1 K for the atom pair
has been gained after excitation (the 1 K is arbitrary–
we only choose it to represent a “standard” loss energy).
Clearly, RE can only be signiﬁcant for the 1Σu state, be-
cause of the negligible short-range emission from the 1Πg
state. We calculate the total probability of radiative es-
cape, Ppe = Pdecay during a complete cycle of vibration
across the region u < up by integrating along the classical
trajectory:

Our calculated results for TD = 1.9 mK for Mg colli-
sions are shown in Figs. 6(a), 7(a), and 8(a). These re-
sults are diﬀerent from the results presented in Ref. [20],
since we have corrected some errors we made in the sum
over partial waves in that reference [48]. Figure 6(a)
shows on a logarithmic scale the separate contributions
of each SC or RE process to the thermally averaged rate
constant K(∆, T ) from Eq. (22), whereas Fig. 7(a) shows
the corresponding results for K(∆, ε) at a single collision
energy ε. Figure 8(a) shows on a linear scale the sum
of contributions from all loss processes, and shows what
one might expect to see in a laboratory spectrum.

The dominant loss process for Mg at 1.9 mK is due to
RE from the 1Σu state. The spectra for 1Σu RE and SC
processes have the same shape, since they have the same
excitation-transfer function κ. The RE and SC processes
diﬀer only by a multiplicative factor that is nearly in-
dependent of ∆, due to the diﬀerent Ppe factors for RE
and SC. The 1Σu RE probability only varies by 0.157 to
0.144 from detunings of 1 to 50 Γat, whereas the 1Σu SC
probability is constant over this range. The 1Σu spec-
tra in Figs. 6(a) and 7(a) are nearly the same, since the

broad features do not change much upon thermal averag-
ing. The rate coeﬃcient becomes very small as detuning
1 for
decreases below 2 or 3 Γat. This is because Jee ≪
very small detuning due to spontaneous emission during
the long-range approach of the two atoms. Spontaneous
emission losses become small for detunings larger than
around 10 Γat, and vibrationally resolved, but rotation-
ally unresolved, photoassociation structure begins to de-
velop as detuning increases. This occurs as the spacing
between adjacent 1Σu vibrational levels from Eq. (6) be-
comes larger than the radiative decay width. Several ro-
tational features with diﬀerent J ′ may contribute to each
of the broad photoassociation resonances, with the range
of J ′ depending on detuning. Each individual 1Σu rota-
tional line has a width on the order of (2Γat + kBT )/h
≈
200 MHz. There is negligible predissociation broadening
due to SC processes in this region of the spectrum.

Using Eq. (5) in Section II C, the vibrational quantum
number vt, as counted down from the top of the potential
at the dissociation limit, can be given for the resolved,
or partially resolved, features in the trap loss spectrum.

We deﬁne vt to be vD −

ger. Each integer vt value deﬁnes an energy range which
contains only one vibrational level for a given J. The
vt quantum numbers for 1Σu and 1Πg features are indi-
cated on Fig. 7. Note that there are many levels (not
calculated) within the range ∆/Γat < 1, a range where
Eq. (5) is not meaningful due to retardation eﬀects on
the potential. The broad 1Σu features provide an exam-
ple of overlapping resonances, analogous to those treated
by Bell and Seaton [49] for the case of dielectronic recom-
bination where the spacing between collisional resonance
levels becomes less than their radiative decay width.

The contribution to K(∆, T ) from the 1Πg SC pro-
cess shows much sharper vibrational structure than the
corresponding 1Σu spectrum. This is because of the
small radiative widths of the 1Πg levels, which become
even smaller as ∆ increases. The individual contribution
from a number of narrow rotational levels is evident in
Fig. 7(a). Figure 6(a) shows that this 1Πg structure even
survives thermal averaging. Figure 8(a) shows that sharp
1Πg features can even survive thermal averaging at 1.9
mK, although such features are quite weak for Mg and
would be hard to see (However, see below for Ca and

that there are sharp J ′ = 1 1Πg features due to s-wave
collisions that can be much narrower than kBT (which is
about 40 MHz at 1.9 mK), whereas features due to l′′ > 0
collisions have widths on the order of kBT . This s-wave
behavior is evident in our numerical calculations, but can
be easily explained in terms of the analytic behavior of
the isolated line shapes using Eqs. (31), (32), and (34).
We will discuss this s-wave resonance narrowing feature
in more detail elsewhere.

Figures 6 and 8 both show that at very small detuning,
on the order of 1 or 2 Γat, the trap loss is dominated
by SC due to the 1Πg state. The increasing radiative
transition probability as detuning decreases, and the near
absence of spontaneous emission losses for the weakly
emitting state, ensures that the 1Πg contribution to trap
loss must be dominant at very small ∆. We will show
in the next section that this is even more important for
the heavier species. Our conclusion concerning the role
of the 1Πg state at small ∆ agrees with the ﬁndings of
Refs. [7,20].

Figures 6(b) and 7(b) show the contributions to SC
and RE processes for Mg at 190 µK. The broad 1Σu fea-
tures are not very sensitive to changing the temperature.
They narrow slightly at the lower temperature. However,
the 1Πg features simplify and clearly have contributions
from fewer partial waves. The eﬀect of thermal averag-
ing on 1Πg features is to cause some broadening, with
consequent decrease in peak height.

FIG. 9. Single 1Πg vibrational feature in the vicinity of
∆
10Γat for (a) Mg, (b) Ca, and (c) Sr. The ﬁgure shows
the quality of the isolated resonance approximation for the
excitation-transfer line shape κ(∆, T ). The solid line is the
complex potential numerical calculation, and the dashed line
is the analytic line shape based on Eqs. (28), (33), and (35).

B. Trap loss for Mg near 1 µK

Figure 8(b) shows K(∆, T ) summed over all compo-
nents at the extremely cold temperature of 1.9 µK. This
is deeply in the Wigner law domain, where only s-wave
collisions contribute to the spectrum, and the rate con-
stant K(∆, T ) becomes independent of T [1]. The broad
1Σu features are similar to the ones at higher tempera-
ture, but are due only to absorption by a single R branch
line from l′′ = 0 to a J ′ = 1 1Σu level. The only signiﬁ-
cant broadening is due to radiative decay. On the other
hand, the 1Πg features, also due to a single R branch
line from l′′ = 0 to a J ′ = 1 1Πg level, become promi-
nent sharp features in the spectrum, having widths on
the order of a few MHz due to radiative decay. Even the

level near 1 Γat detuning is quite sharp and isolated. Sec-
tion II E discusses why we expect to get the vibrational
spacings right, although we do not expect to predict cor-
rectly the actual position of levels, which depend on an
unknown phase due to the short-range 1Πg potential.

Figure 9(a) shows the excellent quality of the isolated
resonance approximation for a Mg 1Πg s-wave absorp-
tion feature due to a single vibrational level. This ap-
proximation should be good in this case, since the mean
vibrational spacing near this level is 280 MHz, which is
much larger than the width. The Figure compares the
numerical line shape with that calculated using the iso-
lated resonance formulas discussed in Section III C. The
analytic formula calculates the factors in Eqs. (28), which
are used in Eq. (26), by making the isolated resonance ap-
proximation, Eq. (33), and the reﬂection approximation,
Eq. (35). The linewidth in the denominator of Eq. (33),
calculated to be 1.6 MHz from Eq. (37), is almost entirely
due to weak spontaneous decay of this 1Πg level, as dis-
cussed Section III C in relation to Fig. 5. Any broaden-
ing due to thermal averaging is negligible, since kBT /h =
0.04 MHz.

We have veriﬁed that our thermal spectrum at rela-
tively high temperature, 1.9 mK, is to a good approxima-
tion independent of the choice of ground state potential,
as discussed in Section II D. This is because of the need
to sum over several partial waves, for which the phase
of the ground state wavefunction varies by more than π.
In addition, the need to average over a range of collision
energies also contributes a range of phase variation to the
ground state wavefunction.

The spectrum at very low temperature, on the other
hand, is sensitive to the phase of the ground state wave-
function, which is generally unknown for Group II species
and strongly dependent of the details of the ground state
potential. This sensitivity is explained by the reﬂection
approximation in Eq. (35), which shows Peg is propor-
tional to sin2 k(RC −
A0). We have just seen that the
reﬂection approximation is excellent for isolated reso-
nance line shapes. Therefore, if we know K(∆, T ) in
the s-wave domain for one scattering length A0, and
if we have a diﬀerent potential with a diﬀerent scat-
tering length A′
0, the K(∆, T ) for the new case can be
scaled from the original one by multiplying by the ratio
A′
0)/ sin2 k(RC −
sin2 k(RC −
A0). Figure 10 compares
this scaling (dashed lines) to numerical calculations (solid
lines) for several diﬀerent model ground state potentials
with diﬀerent A′
0. The former are scaled from our original
calculation, for which A0 =
95 a0. Figure 10 demon-
strates that this scaling is a good approximation, even
when the scattering length is unusually large and even for
overlapping 1Σu features. The scaling relation is excel-
lent at small ∆ for scattering lengths having magnitudes
up to a few times x0 (deﬁned in Sec. II D and having a
value of 36 a0 for Mg). The scaling is even a reasonable
approximation for the case where A′
0 = 400 a0 and the
ground state wavefunction has a node at RC = A′
0 near

FIG. 10. Scaling with diﬀerent scattering lengths of
K(∆, ε) for the 1Σu transition in Mg. The bold solid line
shows the numerically calculated K(∆, ε) at ε = kB(1.9
µK) for the “standard” ground state model potential with
A0 =
95 a0. The other solid lines show the calculated
K(∆, ε) for three other model potentials with diﬀerent scat-
tering lengths of 99 a0, 400 a0, and 930 a0. The dashed line
shows the scaled K(∆, ε) calculated from the “standard” one
using the scaling relation discussed in the text. The detuning
for which the Condon point is 400 a0 is indicated by the ar-
row. The eﬀect of the node in the ground state wavefunction
is evident for the A0 = 400 a0 case.

V. OTHER ALKALINE EARTH ATOMS

Our calculations for the other Group II species and Yb
are shown in Figs. 9(b), 9(c), 11, 12, and 13. We trust
that these model calculations, which can only provide
order of magnitude estimates for SC probabilities and
predissociation contributions to linewidths, will provide
a useful qualitative guide to diﬀerences and similarities
among the various cases to guide future experiments on
these systems. Our calculations should be fairly robust
with respect to qualitative expectations as to the diﬀerent
kinds of features to expect in trap loss spectra.

Figure 9(b) shows that a very low temperature Ca
1Πg feature is very similar to the Mg one previously
discussed. The total width is slightly larger than the
radiative width due to weak predissociation of this fea-
ture (see Fig. 5). The eﬀect of the large predissociation
width, where Γvp > Γrad, is evident for the Sr feature in
Fig. 9(c). The isolated resonance approximation is also
beginning to fail for Sr lines because of the strong predis-
sociation broadening in our model with Ppe = 0.22 (see
Fig. 4). Although our model calculation for Sr predissoci-
ation widths should not be considered to be reliable, the
model does show that if the widths of 1Πg features like

if evaluated at the same scaled detuning, ∆/Γat). These
scaling factors account for the relative magnitudes of the
peak κ(∆, T ) for the 1Σu state in Fig. 11(a) in the rel-
atively ﬂat region from 20 to 50 ∆/Γat. The scaling for
the 1Πg spectra in Fig. 11(b) also needs to take into ac-
count the predissociation contribution to the width Γv,
which was taken to be purely radiative for the scaling of
the 1Σu spectrum in Fig. 11(a). For example, this extra
predissociation broadening lowers the peak of Sr features
below those for Mg in Fig. 11(b).

allow a value to be determined for Ppe. Since temper-
atures in the nK regime have already been reported for
intercombination line cooling of Sr, it may be quite fea-
sible to measure such widths.

Figure 11 shows the thermally averaged excitation-
transfer coeﬃcients κ(∆, T ) (see Eq. (26) and following)
for the 1Σu and 1Πg states in these systems at TD for the
1S
1P cooling transition. In spite of the fact that the
inner zone SC probability Ppe is divided out of the expres-
sion for κ(∆, T ), there are still a number of diﬀerences
among the diﬀerent species. The diﬀerences in spacing
and contrast of the individual vibrational features that
appear at larger detuning is clearly related to the vibra-
tional spacing, Eq. (6), which decreases with increasing
mass. The diﬀerences in magnitude can be qualitatively
related to the scaling of the diﬀerent factors that make up
κ(∆, ε) in Eq. (26). There are four factors that contribute

make a dominant contribution to the small detuning trap
loss for ∆ < a few Γat. This has already been discussed
in Refs. [7,20]. We can compare our results to the mea-
10−10 cm3/s [50] for
sured 2K(∆, T ) = 4.5(0.3)(1.1)
Sr at ∆/Γat = 1.75, I = 60 mW/cm2, and T
4TD
[7]. Although the eﬀect of a strong laser ﬁeld needs
to be investigated for this case, Ref. [24] suggests that
near-linear scaling may apply to small detuning trap loss
even in the strong ﬁeld domain (see Fig. 6 of that refer-
ence). If we assume linear scaling with I, our calculated
value for T = TD at I = 1 mW/cm2 scales to a value of
10−10 cm3/s at I = 60 mW/cm2. The agree-
2K = 6
ment of our very approximate model to within a factor
of two with the measured result for Sr is gratifying and
lends conﬁdence to the usefulness of our estimates.

At the present, there are no other data on Sr or other
Group II species to which we can compare our calcula-
tions directly. The Ca2 photoassociation spectra in a 3
mK Ca MOT reported by Zinner et al. in Ref. [17] ex-
tend over a detuning range from about 50 to 2700 Γat,
which is larger than we calculate. They observed 1Σu
features and gave a detailed analysis of partially resolved

rotational substructure for a feature near ∆ = 27 GHz
= 780 Γat. The fact that the width of this feature could
be explained by a combination of natural and thermal
broadening of several rotational lines implies that pre-
dissociation broadening makes a small contribution to
the linewidth of this feature. If we assume that 20 MHz
or less of the observed 150 MHz feature width is due
to predissociation, we would then estimate the 1Σu SC
Ppe < 0.05, which is much less than the value 0.4 esti-
mated by our model for Ca. Although our model should
not be extrapolated to such large detuning without care-
ful testing, this apparent inconsistency points out that
much more detailed knowledge of potentials and matrix
elements is needed for accurate calculations. It is an in-
teresting fact to be explained why the apparent predisso-
ciation rate of 1Σu levels in Ca2 is relatively small, given
the likelihood of several curve crossings with moderately
large matrix elements (see Fig. 2).

Our calculations in Fig. 12 suggest that resolved struc-
ture due to 1Πg features may be seen at small detunings
below around 25Γat for Ca and Ba. Structure for Sr
is predicted to be suppressed by strong predissociation
broadening. No 1Πg structure was reported for detun-
ings larger than around 50Γat in Ref. [17]. Such 1Πg
structure in Ca2 at these larger detunings may be hard
to see due to masking by the strong 1Σu features.

Figure 13 shows our predictions for Ca and Sr features
at extremely low T = TD/1000. This is in the s-wave
limit where the 1Πg structure becomes quite sharp, as
discussed in relation to Fig. 9 above.
In this domain
sharp 1Πg features should be the dominant features in the
trap loss spectrum. It is noteworthy that this structure
is predicted to persist even to very small detunings on
the order of Γat. Thus, if the Sr trap loss experiments
of Ref. [7] could be repeated at these low temperatures,
such features might be measurable. Figure 5 predicts
that predissociation widths may be large enough for Sr2
1Πg features at even a few Γat detuning that observed
broadening in the spectra might be able to determine
Ppe for the Sr 1Πg SC process. Thus, low temperature
measurements provide for tests of consistency with high
temperature measurements.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out model calculations of the small-
detuning collisional trap loss spectrum of laser cooled
Group II species Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba and also Yb. We
consider detunings ∆ up to 50 atomic linewidths Γat to
1P1 laser cooling transition for
the red of the 1S0 →
these species and treat both inelastic state-changing col-
lisions and radiative loss. Although our calculations are
only model calculations because the short-range molec-
ular potentials are not known to suﬃcient accuracy, we
do incorporate the correct long-range aspects of the po-
tentials and spectra. These calculations are intended as

a guide for developing experimental studies on these sys-
tems, which have the advantage that the collisions are
not complicated by molecular hyperﬁne structure.

We consider both the mK range for Doppler cooling
1P1 transition, and µK range for
on the allowed 1S0 →
3P1 intercombination tran-
Doppler cooling on the 1S0 →
sition. Collisions in the mK range involve many partial
waves, whereas µK collisions only involve s-wave colli-
sions. Our quantum mechanical calculations avoid semi-
classical approximations and properly account for the
threshold properties of the collisions. Our interpretation
of trap loss collision dynamics is based on a factorization
of the overall probability into parts that represent long-
range excitation, propagation to the short-range region,
and short-range radiative or curve crossing processes that
lead to loss. Thus, we can deﬁne an excitation-transfer
coeﬃcient κ(∆, T ), which, unlike the conventional rate
coeﬃcient K(∆, T ), oﬀers a signiﬁcant degree of indepen-
dence from the details of unknown short-range processes.
Our analysis shows how analytic formulas in the limits of
small or large detuning can be used to interpret the trap
loss spectrum.

The trap loss spectra in all the Group II systems
are inﬂuenced by two molecular transitions, the dipole-
1Σu transtion and the dipole-forbidden
allowed 1Σg →
1Πg transition. The latter becomes allowed at
1Σg →
long-range because of retardation corrections to the tran-
sition matrix element. The 1Σu features are structure-
less at small detuning and reduced in magnitude due to
spontaneous decay of the excited state as the atoms ap-
proach one another on the excited state molecular poten-
tial. They show broad vibrationally resolved but rota-

tionally unresolved photoassociation structure as detun-
ing increases away from atomic resonance. On the other
hand, the 1Πg absorption always dominates at small de-
tuning. Resolved 1Πg vibrational and rotational pho-
toassociation structure can persist even to small detun-
ing, and should be especially prominent at very low tem-
perature. Measurement of the widths of such features
could lead to information about the short-range prob-
ability of the state-changing collisions, at least for the
heavier Group II elements.

There are only very limited data with which we can
compare our calculations. Our model calculations agree
within a factor of two with the measured Sr trap loss
rate coeﬃcient at a single detuning. Photoassociation
spectra for Ca only exist for much larger detuning than
we consider here, but suggest that the probability of
the 1Σu state changing process may be much smaller
than our model calculations indicate. The time is right
for more detailed and complete experimental studies on
these Group II systems. Recent experimental advances
in Group II cooling and trapping suggest that such stud-
ies will be forthcoming. A number of other directions
are also open for continuing experimental and theoret-
ical studies, for example, trap loss collisions near the
3P1 intercombination line, or collisions associated
1S0 →
with two 1P1 atoms or two 3P atoms.

[48] An error in the line strength function in our computer
code resulted in magnitudes for K that were too large in
Ref. [20], and the sum over l
was truncated too soon.
The qualitative results given in Ref. [20] are correct, how-
ever.

[50] Since two atoms are lost per collision, Ref. [7] reported
the total atom loss rate coeﬃcient β, which is 2K with
our deﬁnition of K.

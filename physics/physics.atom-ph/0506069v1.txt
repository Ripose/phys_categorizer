We report new detailed density proﬁle measurements in expanding strongly-coupled neutral plas-
mas. Using laser-induced ﬂuorescence techniques, we determine plasma densities in the range of 105
to 109 cm−3 with a time resolution limit as small as 7 ns. Strong-coupling in the plasma ions is in-
ferred directly from the ﬂuorescence signals. Evidence for strong-coupling at late times is presented,
conﬁrming a recent theoretical result.

Strongly-coupled Coulomb systems appear in extreme
conditions, such as in quark-gluon plasmas [1], in laser-
fusion plasmas [2], and in some astrophysical settings. A
new class of strongly-interacting neutral plasmas was re-
cently demonstrated using the tools of laser-cooling and
trapping [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These “ultracold” neutral plasmas
occupy a unique position in phase space. In these plas-
mas it is possible to create strongly-interacting Coulomb
systems at modest densities because the initial electron
and ion temperatures can be in the milliKelvin range.
The initial ion-ion and ion-electron interaction strength
can also be selected with great precision.

Recent experimental work in this ﬁeld has used absorp-
tion imaging techniques to make temperature and den-
sity measurements in expanding ultracold neutral plas-
mas [6, 7]. This work explored the 50 to 1000 ns time pe-
riod after plasma formation in great detail. Correlation-
induced heating was observed in the plasma ions. The
ion coupling parameter, given as the ratio of nearest-
neighbor Coulomb energy to the kinetic energy, equili-
brated just inside the strongly-coupled regime, with a
coupling parameter around 2.

Radio-frequency (RF) excitation techniques have also
been used to determine the average ion density and the
electron temperature in these systems [4, 8, 9]. These
studies conﬁrm theoretical predictions regarding the gen-
erally self-similar Gaussian expansion of the ions and
the clamping of the electron temperature in the weakly-
coupled regime.

In this letter we report laser-induced-ﬂuorescence mea-
surements of ions in expanding strongly-coupled plasmas
as a tool to study the spatial and temporal evolution of
the ion temperature and density. This measurement tech-
nique has a 7 ns temporal resolution limit. We measure
plasma densities as low as 105 cm−3 at eﬀective plasma
temperatures of 100 K. The maximum density that can
be measured is limited by radiation trapping, and for
spherically-symmetric systems in the milliKelvin range
is limited to around 109 cm−3. The temporal resolution

and dynamic range of this method in ultracold plasma
measurements surpass those currently seen in absorp-
tion spectroscopy, and rival the sensitivity of RF spec-
troscopic methods.

Much of the experimental setup has been described
previously [10]. We create a calcium magneto-optical
(MOT) using the resonance transition at 423 nm. Up to
50 mW of 423 nm radiation is generated by frequency-
doubling a diode laser system at 846 nm using a
periodically-poled KTP crysal in a resonant build-up cav-
ity. The 423 nm MOT light is detuned one line-width
below the atomic transition, making the MOT temper-
ature around 1 mK. Its 1/e2 radius is 0.5 mm in two
dimensions, and 1.2 mm in the third. We use a grating-
stabilized 657 nm diode laser as a re-pumper. The den-
sity proﬁle is approximately Gaussian with a peak density
of 4

109 cm−3.

We photo-ionize the atoms in the MOT using a two-
color, two-photon ionization process. A portion of the
846 nm diode laser radiation from the MOT laser is
pulse-ampliﬁed in a pair of YAG-pumped dye cells and
frequency doubled. This produces a 3 ns-duration laser
pulse at 423 nm with a pulse energy around 1 µJ. This
laser pulse passes through the MOT, and its peak in-
tensity is a few thousand times greater than the satura-
tion intensity. A second YAG-pumped dye laser at 390
nm counter-propagates the 423 nm pulse and excites the
MOT atoms to low-energy states above the ionization
potential. We photo-ionize 85-90% of the ground-state
atoms in the MOT. The minimum electron temperature
is limited by the 30 GHz (measured) bandwidth of the
390 nm laser to about 1 K.

Ions in the plasma scatter light from a probe laser
beam tuned to the Ca II 2S1/2 −
2 P1/2 transition at 397
nm. The probe laser is focused to a Gaussian waist of
130 µm in the MOT. We average repeated measurements
of the scattered 397 nm radiation with the probe laser
in a given position. This produces a time-resolved sig-
nal proportional to the number of atoms resonant with
the probe beam in a particular column of the plasma.
By translating a mirror just outside the MOT chamber,

we can scan the probe laser across the ion cloud.
this manner we obtain temporal and spatial information
about the plasma expansion. Typical ﬂuorescence mea-
surements are shown in Fig. 1.

FIG. 1: Laser-induced-ﬂuorescence of ions in an expanding
ultracold plasma. In the upper panel, the probe beam is par-
allel to (and collinear with) the long axis of the initial plasma
density distribution. In each successive panel, the probe beam
is moved 0.22 mm = 0.44σ0 farther away from this symmetry
axis. Note that the time scale is logarithmic and the ﬂuo-
rescence scale is linear. The probe laser is tuned to the ion
resonance for these measurements. The maximum time res-
olution of the system is 7 ns. The solid line is the expected
signal from a thermal expansion model, as explained in the
text.

When the probe beam is on axis (Fig. 1, top panel),
the ﬂuorescence signal takes roughly 20 ns to reach its
maximum value. This duration is a few times the 7 ns ra-
diative lifetime of the Ca II 2P1/2 level. This is an exam-
ple of the classic Rabi two-level atom problem with spon-
taneous emission, where a collection of atoms driven on
resonance well below the saturation intensity will reach
a steady excited-state population after a few radiative
lifetimes. We also see this same turn-on time when we
perform absorption measurements on the plasma ions.
A higher probe laser intensity would drive the ion pop-
ulation into the excited state more quickly, making it
possible to probe the plasma at earlier times.

After the signal peaks, it rapidly decays. At t

100 ns
the decay slows down. This is due to correlation-induced
heating in the ions, similar to previously published ab-

∼

sorption measurements [7]. During the ﬁrst microsecond
of the decay, while the spatial distribution of the plasma
ions has not changed, it is straightforward to convert
this ﬂuorescence decay signal into velocity as a function
of time. With just a few assumptions, we can determine
the temperature, density, and strong-coupling parameter
of the plasma ions.

(vz/b)

An atom moving with velocity vz parallel to the
propagation direction of the probe laser beam has a
Lorentzian probability of scattering a photon, propor-
tional to
+1 . The constant b = γλ/2 is the
velocity that corresponds to a Doppler shift equal to the
natural linewidth, γ = 1/2πτ is the natural linewidth of
the transition, and λ is the transition wavelength. The
initial velocity distribution is Maxwellian, of the form
exp(v2
th)/√πvz. For systems in thermal equilibrium,
vth is the thermal velocity. As mentioned in the literature
[? ], the temperature should be a measure of the random
motion of ions. In these kinds of measurements for ex-
panding ultracold plasmas, this random motion is observ-
able only at early times. The random motion is quickly
overwhelmed by the directed motion of the plasma ex-
pansion. So vth quickly looses its meaning in a thermo-
dynamic sense. However, when the ions are “heated” by
correlations the Maxwellian approximation is still valid.
We integrate the product of the Lorentzian line shape
and the Maxwellian distribution to get an expression for
how the ﬂuorescence signal, s(t), changes with the width
of the ion velocity distribution as a function of time:

√2vth (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(1)

where erfc(x) is the complimentary error function of the
parameter x. If vth is known at a particular time, this
equation can be inverted to give the change in the ther-
mal velocity as a function of time.

The initial neutral atom velocity is near the Doppler
limit at 40 cm/s. The neutral atoms also experience a
ionization recoil velocity of 40 cm/s. In the inversion of
Eq. 1, we set the scale so that a linear extrapolation of
the signal to time t = 0 gives the quadrature sum of the
Doppler and recoil velocities, 56 cm/s, as shown in Fig.
2.

A thermal model of ultracold plasma expansions was
presented in Ref.
[11, 12]. We have analytically solved
the coupled diﬀerential equations presented in that work
[8], and ﬁnd the analytical solution to the directed ex-
pansion velocity to be

FIG. 2: The mean z-component of the ion velocity as a func-
tion of time after plasma formation. The points show the
velocity extracted from the ion ﬂuorescence signal with the
probe laser propagating along the plasma symmetry axis. The
solid line is a ﬁt of the data to a thermal model [12], as de-
scribed in the text. The dashed line shows the extrapolation
to 56 cm/s at time t = 0. The inset shows the ratio of the data
to the thermal model, accentuating the correlation-induced
heating signal.

This ﬁgure illustrates correlation-induced heating, and
provides an independent check of the plasma density.
When the plasma is created, the ions quickly move from
their initial disordered state into a state with greater or-
der. This motion is initially synchronized at the plasma
frequency. But because of variations in the local elec-
tric ﬁeld at each ion, the oscillatory motion becomes un-
synchronized (Landau damping). The time from plasma
creation to the maximum temperature (minimum signal)
in this oscillation is equal to t = 1/4ωp, where ωp is the
average plasma frequency. As seen in the inset to Fig.
2, the peak occurs at 60 ns, giving an average plasma
108 cm−3, about a factor of three lower
density of 4.0
than what we expect based on the ionization fraction of
the neutral MOT.

The strong-coupling constant in this system can be
determined from data extracted from Fig. 2. The ki-
netic energy of the system is equal to mv2/2, where
z , and the random thermal motion
v =
due to correlation heating is assumed to be isotropic.
Using the derived values of vz = 8 m/s and n =
108 cm−3, the strong-coupling parameter is Γ =

During the time from 1 to 40 µs, the ﬂuorescence signal
depends on the time-evolution of the ion temperature,
the overall plasma expansion velocity, and the density.
As the plasma expands, the number of ions in the probe
laser beam decreases. Also, as the velocity distribution
widens, the fraction of atoms in the beam that are in
resonance with the probe laser frequency also decreases.

The thermal epansion model in Ref.

[12] provides a
theoretical framework for interpreting our data. The
essence of the model is that the initial Gaussian density
distribution is maintained for all times during the plasma
expansion, so that the density n(t) can be written

n(r, t) =

N
σ3(t)

where N is the total number of atoms in the plasma.
This model explicitly assumes that the distribution is
spherically symmetric. We modify that condition to meet
the elongated initial distribution of our plasma.

In the experiment, the probe laser beam is spatially ﬁl-
tered and focused into the plasma with a Gaussian beam
waist of w = 130 µm. The position oﬀset of this probe
laser relative to the plasma is denoted by the distance a.
The two-dimensional convolution of the probe laser and
the plasma distribution is proportional to the number of
plasma ions in the probe beam, and it can be written as

by the Lorentzian lineshape (deﬁned previously) gives a
probability that an ion in the probe beam column mov-
ing with a z-component of velocity vz interacts with the

to relate the velocity vz to the spatial coordinate z. In-
tegrating this expression over z gives the predicted time-

This ﬂuorescence model is the solid line plotted with
the data in Fig. 1. The only two adjustable parameters
in the model are the expansion velocity ve and the overall
amplitude. We choose these two parameters so that the
model agrees with the data in the last panel of the ﬁgure.
Considering the simplicity of this model, it is surprising
that it matches the general shape and order of magnitude
of the ﬂuorescence signal.

Relative to the model, the experimental data are con-
sistently higher at later times. Not only that, but the
data recorded with the probe laser beam situated be-
tween a = σ0 and 3σ0 all show structure that can-
not be explained by the model. Predictions of ion-
acoustic waves freezing into the plasma expansion have
been made. However, the observed modulations are not
stationary relative to the plasma expansion. A vertical
slice through all of the panels in Fig. 1 gives the den-
sity proﬁle at a given time. The data show that two

4

local maxima that develop in the interior of the plasma
coalesce into one another and disappear relative to the
smooth Gaussian shape predicted by the model (lowest
frame). Contrary to predictions of several models, we see
no evidence for shock formation in this plasma.

It is likely that the plasma ions are strongly coupled
throughout the expansion. As mentioned previously, the
ions equilibrate after 100 ns with a coupling parameter of
Γ = 4. Recently completed hybrid molecular dynamics
models of the expansion [13] show that after an initial
oscillation, the coupling parameter always increases. The
absence of a shock front in the plasma expansion and
also the observed suppression of local density variations is
strong evidence that the plasma ion system is collisionally
stiﬀ, once again suggesting strong coupling.

It may be possible to use ion ﬂuorescence measure-
ments to observe the inﬂuence of three-body recombina-
tion on the plasma expansion. While plasma electrons
can be placed initially in a strongly-coupled state, theo-
retical work has shown that recombination and electron-
Rydberg scattering heat the electrons so that the cou-
pling parameter Γ
0.2 [11, 12, 14, 15]. It is also known
that at low temperatures these heating processes, which
occur at early times in the expansion, completely dom-
inate the expansion velocity. The three-body recombi-
nation rate in a strongly-coupled system is on the order
of the electron plasma frequency. By carefully select-
ing the initial plasma temperature and density, it should
be possible to create a plasma in which the electron
plasma frequency is less than the linewidth of the ion

∼

resonance transition. Choosing the ion laser intensity so
that the Rabi frequency is greater than the transition
linewidth would then enable measurements with a suf-
ﬁcient time resolution to probe the plasma dynamics in
the recombination-dominated regime. Perhaps it would
be possible to resolve the onset of recombination when
the plasma is created, and also its decline as the electron
temperature rises.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique
for determining the the density of ions in an expanding
ultracold plasma using ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. Our
implementation of this technique has a time resolution
of 7 ns. We report measurements of the density pro-
ﬁle for up to 50 µs, and demonstrate a sensitivity limit
around 105 cm−3. This method surpasses the time res-
olution and dynamic range of previously reported tech-
niques. It rivals the sensitivity limit of RF techniques,
and provides detailed spatial information of the plasma
density proﬁle. We have created a plasma just inside
the strongly-coupled regime, and observe changes in the
plasma density over time. Based on recent theoretical
work, it is likely that these plasmas are strongly-coupled
for the entire measured expansion. The general features
of our measurements are in reasonable agreement with
a thermal model, although the remaining discrepancies
require more sophisticated methods to interpret quanti-
tatively.

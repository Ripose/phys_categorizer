A test of Lorentz invariance has been performed using an EIT resonance as a precision frequency

discriminator within an Ives-Stilwell like apparatus. We analyse the experiment within the frame-

The principle of Lorentz invariance has played such a central role in the foundation of

modern physics that it has promoted numerous precision experiments to test the validity

of its predictions. In recent times a strong motivation in the search for Lorentz violating

signals has come from theories which go beyond the standard model of particle physics and

allow for, if not predict, a violation from the Lorentz symmetry at some level e.g. string

theory, quantum loop gravity [1][2]. Precision tests of Lorentz invariance typically take one

of three forms, the Michelson-Morley test [3], the Kennedy-Thorndike test [4] and the Ives-

Stilwell test [5]. It is the Ives-Stilwell test we have based our experiment upon. To enhance

the sensitivity of the experiment we use the modern spectroscopic technique of Electrically

Induced Transparency (EIT) where a medium that is normally opaque to a laser is rendered

transparent via the interaction of a second, control, laser. The same technique allows for

precise manipulation of the group velocity within the medium [6]. The transmission window

of an EIT resonance is also extremely narrow enabling precision frequency discrimination

and amplifying the sensitivity of the experiment. This provides an excellent platform from

which to look for new physics [7].

There are a number of test theories capable of analysing experiments sensitive to a de-

viation from the Lorentz symmetry which oﬀer useful comparisons between diﬀerent ex-

periments [8][9]. However, it is hard to gain insight into the relevant underlying physical

processes and therefore deomstrate the subtlty of diﬀerent approaches. Recently, Kostelecky

and co-workers have parameterised violations of Lorentz invariance within an extension of

the Standard Model of particle physics [10][11]. The Standard Model Extension (SME),

as it is known, allows for small general CPT and Lorentz violating terms constructed from

known ﬁelds. The fermion sector of this general theory has received much attention, and

precise bounds have been placed on its predictions [12]. In this paper we therefore ignore

this sector and look at terms concerning only the QED sector of the SME [10][11] with a

resulting lagrangian density,

where Fµν is the normal Maxwell ﬁeld tensor, Aλ is the vector potential and the two co-
eﬃcients (kAF )κ and (kF )κλµν describe Lorentz violating terms which are CPT odd and CPT
even respectively. Experiments [12] have placed stringent bounds on (κAF )κ, and for our

2

purposes we have assumed it to be zero, (κAF )κ = 0. To understand the relationship between

our experiment and the SME we draw upon a useful analogy between photon propagation in

this modiﬁed Lorentz violating form of QED and classical homogeneous anisotropic media

[10][11]:

The 3x3 matrices κDE, κDB, κHD and κHB contain 19 independent parameters, considered to

be constant in both space and time, which describe a violation from the Lorentz symmetry.

A detailed description of these matrices in terms of the CPT even co-eﬃcient (kF )κλµν from

equation (1) can be found in Ref [12]. Each κ-tensor from equation (2) can be re-expressed

in terms of quantities accessable directly via experimentation:

Astrophysical observations have constrained the ten parameters in κe+ and κo− to a part
in 1032 [12]. The remaining nine parameters, ﬁve in κe−, three in κo+, and a scalar κtr,

can be accessed via precision table top experiments [13][14][15][16][17]. Upper bounds of
10−15 and 10−11 have been placed on terms in the tensors κe− and κo+ respectively using

precision Michelson-Morley experiments. While κtr, related to the eﬀective permeability,

permittivity and therefore absolute velocity of light in the vacuum, has been constrained to
a part in 105 [17] analysis in [14]. The relatively poor knowledge of κtr compared with the

other SME parameters allows us to make the simpliﬁcation that κe−, κe+, κo− and κo+ are

At this point we can make further use of the analogy between light propagation (in vacuo)

in the SME and in classical anisotropic media by introducing the refractive index vector

displacement ﬁeld in terms of the refractive index vector and electric ﬁeld only:

niEinj.

(7)

(9)

Dj = (1 + κDE)jkEk + κDB

By comparing this to the explicit form of the electric displacement ﬁeld within the SME,
jk Bk, and making use of equations (4) and (5) we arrive at three
linear homogeneous equations involving only the refractive index vector and κtr for the three

components of the electric ﬁeld vector,

(n2δjk −

njnk −

(1 + κtr)δjk)Ek = 0.

Non-trivial solutions of this equation result in an expression for the magnitude of the refrac-

tive index in terms of κtr alone [18]:

n = √1 + κtr.

The κ-tensors are frame dependent unless the observer is in a cosmological frame; i.e a

frame deﬁned by the Cosmic Microwave Background, or any frame moving inertially with

respect to it. The frame dependency of κtr will induce a frame dependency in the phase

velocity of light. Ives-Stilwell experiments [5], and their modern counterparts, are sensitive to

a deviation between the factor c, appearing in the Lorentz time dilation γ = 1/

and the phase velocity of light c′ appearing in the Doppler shift formula [7]. By comparing

the Doppler shifted frequencies of two counter propagating lasers to a frequency reference,

the predictions of time dilation can be tested and a measurement of κtr made.

It is conventional to analyse and compare experiments concerning parameters from the

SME in a co-ordinate system with the sun centred at the origin. Such a frame ignores

4

the rotational motion of the sun. Thus the SME shows that in the presence of a Lorentz

violating eﬀect there will be a frequency diﬀerence, ∆ν =

, between the two counter-

propagating lasers of an Ives-Stilwell experiment.

In the sun centered frame ∆ν will be

dependent on the sidereal modulations in the earth’s velocity due to its rotation, and the

annual modulations due to it’s orbital motion about the sun. Note that because the SME has

been constructed so as to maintain invariance under Lorentz transformations between inertial

frames we are still able to transform refractive indices according to the conventional laws of

special relativity, and after some calculation we arrive at a ﬁrst order approximation for the
modiﬁed refractive index magnitude in the sun centred frame, n′ = 1 + κtr (cid:0)

parallel to the experimental axis. Working in a time frame much less than a year we can look

for periodic signals containing only a 24-sidereal-hour signal. Therefore, for non-vanishing

values of κtr we arrive at an expression for the additional frequency splitting caused by a

violation of Lorentz invariance as observed in the sun centred frame,

∆νmod = 2ν0βatβlabκtr cos(ωt + φ),

of the earth in its orbit.

We used the Sagnac interferometer of Jundt et al [19] as the basis for our experiment.
An eﬀective beam of Rb85 atoms, orientated east-west, is used as a frequency reference

to measure the Doppler shifted frequencies of two lasers moving in parallel, νp, and anti-

parallel, νa, directions with respect to the atomic beam. The beauty of this conﬁguration

is its inherent stability against small changes in cavity length because both arms of the

interferometer use the same optics. Thus the two counter propagating lasers necessary for

an Ives-Stilwell experiment are formed from the two interfering beams that make up our

interferometer. This ensures both lasers have the same rest frame frequency. Using a dual

isotope, rubidium cell with a buﬀer gas of neon at a pressure of 30Torr we form a EIT

resonance with a measured linewidth of

300 Hz. The diode laser (λ = 795 nm) has a

linewidth of

1 MHz and is tuned so that its rest frame frequency is halfway between

resonance with one of these transitions. If the Lorentz symmetry is broken the lasers will

acquire a directional frequency shift. The result being that the joint resonance condition

between the atom and counter propagating light ﬁelds is no longer satisﬁed.

pump ﬁeld and the white arrow the weaker probe ﬁeld. However, the symmetry of the experiment

the cell and double layered mu-metal shielding. Scanning the magnetic ﬁeld and keeping the

laser frequency constant allows us to determine the diﬀerence frequency, ∆ν, between the

light beams. The spatial symmetry of the experiment provides us with two simultaneous

measurements. Those atoms moving in opposite directions observe the pump and probe

beam frequencies interchanged. For non-zero values of κtr we expect to see two EIT dips

with a separation proportional to the magnitude of κtr. Other experiments have shown

that any such violation will be extremely small [17][14], even with a narrow transmission

window of 300Hz it will not be possible to resolve each of the two peaks individually. In

our data analysis we therefore assume that the observed dip in the absorption of the probe

beam is the convolution of two unresolved dips using a ﬁt to extract the separation between

6

them. It is expected that any observed signal will take the form of a 24-sidereal-hour cosine.

However, because we are sensitive only to the magnitude of the beat frequency, we have no

means of distinguishing beams after detection, we therefore look for signals with an angular

frequency 2ω only. The atomic velocity distribution within the cell is removed by the use of

counter propagating lasers. A detailed description of the physics of this interaction and the

nature of Doppler free spectroscopy will be included in a future publication.

Data is collated by measuring the diﬀerence frequency ∆ν at 5 minute intervals. The data

presented in Fig.3 has been extracted from a run performed during April 2005. The ﬁtted

separation between two unresolved dips is displayed as a function of time over a 72-hour

period. In the present paper we are only concerned with a relative change in ∆ν and not

an absolute measurement of frequency shift which is more sensitive to background magnetic

ﬁelds; a constant oﬀset has been removed from the data. In order to look for modulations

in the data we have used a least squares technique to ﬁt an amplitude to a 12-sidereal-hour

cosine with a phase ﬁxed by the position of the earth in its orbit and the time of day.

The amplitude of the ﬁtted cosine is 11

51 Hz (90% conﬁdence). Thus the largest signal

extracted from the measurement of Saathoﬀ [17] via analysis within the SME.

There are two paths to increase the sensitivty of the experiment: removing residual mag-

netic ﬁelds, and increasing the atomic velocity which is linearly proportional to the predicted

frequency splitting. Magnetic ﬁelds present within the shielding cause frequency splittings,

and have been shown to contain components with a modulation frequency comparable to

that of our 12-sidereal hour signal that will contribute a systematic eﬀect. The most likely

cause of this being the temperature dependant permeabillity of the mu-metal. For future

experiments we propose moving to a less magnetically susceptible

i
transition using linearly polarised light. Considering such transitions are only subject to

the much smaller second order Zeeman shift this will greatly reduce the eﬀect of residual

ﬁelds. While increasing the atomic velocity will improve the sensitivity of the experiment an

EIT resonance must be found with suitable hyperﬁne transition such that vat = ∆νhypc/2ν0.

Further room for improvement where large gains in sensitivity can be achieved is in analysis

of a constant ofset in the frequency diﬀerences. These needed to be discarded in the current

experiment as residual magnetic ﬁelds also give rise to similar shifts. Removing the eﬀect

of this systematic shift permits this measurement and can provide up to three orders of

magnitude improvement in the resolution.

A practical high-accuracy relativistic method of atomic structure calculations for univalent atoms
is presented. The method is rooted in the coupled-cluster formalism and includes non-perturbative
treatment of single and double excitations from the core and single, double and triple excitations
involving valence electron. Triple excitations of core electrons are included in the fourth-order of
many-body perturbation theory. In addition, contributions from the disconnected excitations are
incorporated. Evaluation of matrix elements includes all-order dressing of lines and vertices of the
diagrams. The resulting formalism for matrix elements is complete through the fourth order and
sums certain chains of diagrams to all orders. With the developed method we compute removal
energies, magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne-structure constants A and electric-dipole amplitudes. We ﬁnd
that the removal energies are reproduced within 0.01-0.03% and the hyperﬁne constants of the 3s1/2
and 3p1/2 states with a better than 0.1% accuracy. The computed dipole amplitudes for the principal
3s1/2 − 3p1/2;3/2 transitions are in an agreement with 0.05%-accurate experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

This work is aimed at designing a practical ab initio atomic-structure method capable of reaching accuracy at the
level of 0.1% for properties of heavy univalent many-electron atomic systems. The improved accuracy is required, for
example, for a reﬁned interpretation of atomic parity violation (APV) with atomic Cs [1, 2, 3] and planned experiment
with Ba+ [4]. At present namely the accuracy of solving the basic correlation problem is the limiting factor in the
APV probe of “new physics” beyond the standard model of elementary particles. In addition, it is anticipated that
the improved accuracy would unmask so far untested contributions from quantum electrodynamics (QED) in heavy
neutral many-electron systems [5].

Here we report developing a many-body approach based on the coupled-cluster (CC) formalism [6, 7]. In the CC
formalism the many-body contributions to wave function are lumped into a hierarchy of multiple (single, double, ...)
particle-hole excitations from the lowest-order state. Due to a computational complexity, previous relativistic CC-type
calculations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] for univalent atoms were limited to single- and double excitations. Triple excitations
were treated only in an approximate semi-perturbative fashion [8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Compared to these previous
calculations, here we fully include valence triple excitations in the CC formulation; we will designate our approximation
as CCSDvT method. Further, compared to calculations by Notre Dame group, here we also incorporate a subset of
so-called disconnected excitations (non-linear CC terms). For sodium atom, such non-linear CC terms were previously
included in Ref. [10] and in non-relativistic calculations [16]. Finally, in calculations of matrix elements we include
CC-dressing of lines and vertices [17] and we also directly compute complementary fourth-order diagrams (mainly
due to core triple excitations). The resulting formalism for matrix elements is complete through the fourth-order of
many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and also subsumes certain chains of diagrams to all orders.

As a ﬁrst application of our method, we carry out numerical calculations for atom of sodium. Sodium (11 elec-
trons) has an electronic structure similar to cesium (55 electrons), but it is not as demanding computationally. By
computing properties of Na atom we observe that a simultaneous treatment of triple and disconnected quadruple
excitations is important for improving theoretical accuracy, as the two eﬀects tend to partially cancel each other. We
compute removal energies, magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne-structure (HFS) constants A and electric-dipole amplitudes for
3pj transitions. We ﬁnd that the removal energies are reproduced within 0.01-0.03% and the
the principal 3s1/2 −
HFS constants of the 3s and 3p1/2 states with a better than 0.1% accuracy. The computed dipole amplitudes are
in a perfect agreement with the 0.05%-accurate experimental data. However, our result for the HFS constant of the
3p3/2 state disagrees with the most accurate experimental values [18, 19] by 1%, while agreeing with less accurate
measurements [20, 21].

The paper is organized as follows. First we discuss generalities of the coupled-cluster formalism and many-body
perturbation theory in Sec. II. Explicit CCSDvT equations and analytical expressions for energies, matrix elements,
and normalization corrections are presented in Section III. In Sec. IV we tabulate and analyze the results of numerical
calculations of properties of sodium atom. Finally, we draw conclusions in Sec. V. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, atomic

II. GENERALITIES

In this Section we recapitulate relevant formulas and ideas of atomic many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and

the coupled-cluster formalism for systems with one valence electron outside the closed-shell core.

A. Atomic Hamiltonian and conventions

The Hamiltonian of an atomic system may be represented as

H =

where hnuc is the Dirac Hamiltonian including kinetic energy of electron and its interaction with the nucleus, UDHF
is the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) potential, and the last term represents the residual Coulomb interaction between
electrons. To reduce the number of MBPT diagrams, we employ frozen-core (or V N −1) DHF potential [22]. The
single-particle orbitals ϕi and energies εi are found from the set of DHF equations,

(hnuc + UDHF) ϕi = εiϕi .

The Hamiltonian in the second quantization reads (omitting common energy oﬀset)

i are annihilation and creation operators, and N [

where operators ai and a†
] stands for a normal product of operators
with respect to the core quasi-vacuum state
. Labels i, j, k and l range over all possible single-particle orbitals. In
the following we will employ a labeling convention where letters a, b, c are reserved for core orbitals, indices m, n, r, s
label virtual states, and letters v and w designate valence orbitals. In this convention valence orbitals are classiﬁed
as the virtual orbitals. In Eq. (3), the quantities gijkl are two-body Coulomb matrix elements

Notice the absence of the one-body contribution of G in the second-quantized Hamiltonian, Eq. (3); this simplifying
feature is due to the employed V N −1 approximation and leads to a greatly reduced number of terms in the CC
equations.

In MBPT the ﬁrst part of the Hamiltonian (3) is treated as the lowest-order Hamiltonian H0 and the residual
Coulomb interaction G as a perturbation. In the lowest order the atomic wave function with the valence electron in
Ψ(0)
an orbital v reads

In the conventional order-by-order MBPT, a perturbative expansion for operator Ω is built in powers of residual

B. Coupled-cluster method

One of the mainstays of practical application of MBPT is an assumption of convergence of series in powers of the
perturbing interaction. Sometimes the convergence is poor and then one sums certain classes of diagrams to “all
orders” using iterative techniques. The coupled-cluster formalism is one of the most popular all-order methods. The
key point of the CC method is the introduction of an exponential ansatz for the wave operator [23]

Ω = N [exp(K)] = 1 + K +

where the cluster operator K is expressed in terms of connected diagrams of the wave operator Ω. The operator K is
naturally broken into cluster operators (K)n combining n simultaneous excitations of core and valence electrons from

Clusters (Kc)n involve excitation from the core orbitals only, while (Kv)n describe simultaneous excitations of the
core and valence electrons. Then S = Sc + Sv, D = Dc + Dv, etc.

A set of coupled equations for the cluster operators (K)n may be found from the Bloch equation [23] specialized

for univalent systems [24]

is a projection operator. Notice that only connected diagrams are retained on the r.h.s of the

equation, r.h.s. diagrams being of the the same topological structure as clusters (K)n. The resulting CC equations
for the core clusters do not depend on the valence state.

Although the CC approach is strictly exact, in practical applications the full cluster operator K is truncated at a
certain level of excitations, e.g., at single and double excitations (CCSD method). In particular, for univalent atoms
the CCSD parametrization may be represented as

A linearized version of the CCSD method discards non-linear terms in the expansion of exponent in Eq. (6) of the
coupled-cluster parametrization, i.e., ΩSD
1 + K SD. This leads to discarding disconnected excitations from the
exact many-body wave function. We will refer to this approximation simply as singles-doubles (SD) method. For
alkali-metal atoms the SD method was employed previously by the Notre Dame group [8, 9, 12, 13]. The resulting SD
equations are written out in Ref.[8]. A typical ab initio accuracy attained for properties of heavy alkali-metal atoms
is at the level of 1%.

Successive iterations of the CC equations (9) recover the traditional order-by-order MBPT. As discussed in Ref.[8],

the core and valence doubles appear already in the ﬁrst order in the residual interaction G:

εa + εb −
εv + εa −
Valence and core singles appear at the second iteration of the CC equations and are eﬀectively of the second order in
G. We will employ this “eﬀective order” classiﬁcation to develop our approximation to the CC equations.

C. Triple excitations. Motivating discussion

Certainly the truncation of the CC expansion leads to a neglect of many-body diagrams containing excitations
beyond singles and doubles. For example, both the SD and the CCSD methods recover all the diagrams for valence
energies through the second order of MBPT, but start missing diagrams associated with valence triple excitations
in the third order [8]. Similarly, for contributions to matrix element of a one-body (e.g., electric dipole ) operator,

the SD method subsumes all the diagrams through the third order but misses approximately half of the diagrams in
the fourth order of MBPT. The omitted fourth-order diagrams are entirely due to triple and disconnected quadruple
excitations [24]. Our group has carried out calculations of these 1,648 complementary diagrams for Na [25] and
Cs [17]. Close examination of our computed complementary diagrams reveals a high ( a factor of a hundred ) degree
of cancelation between diﬀerent contributions. Such cancelations could lead to a poor convergence of the MBPT series.
Poor convergence calls for an all-order summation scheme and this is what we address here. The resulting formalism
will recover the dominant fourth-order contributions to matrix elements and all third-order MBPT contributions to
the valence energies in a nonperturbative fashion.

The next systematic step in improving the SD method would be an additional inclusion of triple excitations

into the cluster operator K (see Fig. 1). However, considering the present state of available computational power, the
full incorporation of triples (speciﬁcally, core triples) seems to be yet not practical for heavy atoms.

To motivate more accurate, yet practical extension of the SD method, we consider numerical results for the reduced
3p1/2 transition in Na [25]. From Table I of that paper, we observe that the
electric-dipole matrix elements of 3s1/2 −

contributions from valence triples Tv (total
10−5). Similar conclusion can be drawn from
1.3
our calculations for heavier Cs atom [17]. Because of this observation we will discard core triples and incorporate the
valence triples into the SD formalism. We will refer to this method as SDvT approximation. Contributions of core
triples to matrix elements are treated in this work perturbatively.

In addition to triples, we will include eﬀects from disconnected excitations. The relevant diagrams contribute at
the same level as the valence triples and the full treatment of disconnected excitations will recover a part of the
otherwise missing sequence of random-phase-approximation diagrams (see also discussion in Ref. [17]). The resulting
approximation will be referred to as CCSDvT method.

Below we write down the CC equations for cluster amplitudes ρ in the CCSDvT approximation. The equations in
the SD approximation are presented in Ref. [8]. We retain convention for the single and doubles from that paper and
focus on additional terms due to valence triples and disconnected excitations. Some of the equations involving triple
excitations were given in Ref. [12, 13]; we use a diﬀerent convention for the triples amplitudes.

III. FORMALISM

A. Valence triples

In the following, we employ fully antisymmetrized valence triples amplitude ˜ρmnrvab. The object ˜ρmnrvab is anti-

symmetric with respect to any permutation of the indices mnr or ab, e.g.,

˜ρmnrvab =

˜ρnmrvab =

˜ρmnrvba = ˜ρmrnvba = . . . .

(16)

It is straightforward to demonstrate that the contribution to the wave operator (and therefore all the resulting
equations) can be expressed in terms of this antisymmetrized object. Explicitly,

Tv =

˜ρmnrvab a†

rabaaav .

Computationally the use of ˜ρmnrvab substantially reduces storage requirements, as it is suﬃcient to store ordered
amplitudes with m > n > r and a > b only. In the equations below, we will also use antisymmetrized combinations
for doubles ˜ρmnab = ρmnab −
ρnmva, and for the Coulomb matrix elements
ρnmab, ˜ρmnva = ρmnva −
˜gijkl = gijkl −

ρmnba = ρmnab −

gijlk.

From the general Eq.(9) we obtain symbolically

(εa + εb + εv −

εm −

εn −

εr + δEv) ˜ρmnrvab =

Tv[Dc] + Tv[Dv] + Tv[Tv] + Tv[Tc] + nonlinear .

Here contribution Tv[Dc] denotes eﬀect of core doubles on valence triples, the remaining terms deﬁned in a similar
fashion. In this work we include only contributions Tv[Dc] and Tv[Dv] (see Fig. 2) and omit the eﬀect of valence
and core triples on valence triples ( Tv[Tv] and Tv[Tc]) and nonlinear CC contributions. Compared to the Tv[Dv] and
Tv[Dc] contributions, these are higher order (and computationally expensive) eﬀects. Explicitly,

Notice that the matching of diagrams in Eq.(9) is generally not unique; we require that the r.h.s. of the above
equation is fully antisymmetrized as the amplitude ˜ρmnrvab on the l.h.s.; such procedure is unique and corresponds to
a projecton of the CC equations onto the many-body state a†
. Also from these equations we immediately
observe that the triples enter the many-body wave function in the eﬀective second order of MBPT, as the doubles
enter in the ﬁrst order in G, Eq.(13).

B. Modiﬁcations to SD equations and valence energies

Here we present CC equations for correlation energy δEv, valence singles ρmv, and for valence double ρmnva cluster
amplitudes. In formulas below we write SD to denote contributions in the singles-doubles approximations tabulated
in Refs. [8, 12]. As to the core amplitudes, they will be determined in the SD approximation (i.e. we do not include
non-linear CC terms and core triples).

C. Normalization

The CC wave function is derived using the intermediate normalization,

properties based on the CC wave function, one needs to renormalize it. In calculations of matrix elements one requires

The last term in the equation above is quadratic in valence triples (i.e., it is of the fourth eﬀective order) and we will
neglect it in the following.

As it was shown in Ref. [8] all disconnected diagrams in the numerator and denominator of this expression cancel,
leading to

We discarded valence-independent contribution, as it vanishes for non-scalar operators. To unclutter the notation
below we simply write

Blundell et al. [8] tabulated 21 contributions to the matrix elements in the SD approximation. These SD corrections
are mainly due to (i) random-phase-approximation (RPA) diagram proportional to a product of Z and Dv and (ii)
the Brueckner-type (core-polarization) diagram proportional to the product of Z and Sv. In Ref. [17] we additionally
included modiﬁcations to
Mwv caused by non-linear terms in the CC wave function. We have devised a re-summation
scheme that is equivalent to “dressing” of lines and vertices of the SD diagrams (see also Ref. [26]).

Including valence triples leads to additional direct contributions, Zwv = SD + Z (Tv )

E. Symmetries and reduced triples

Relativistic one-particle orbitals i are characterized by the principle quantum number ni, the total angular momen-
tum ji, it’s projection mi and the orbital angular momentum li. The summations over magnetic quantum numbers
are carried out analytically, substantially reducing the number of coeﬃcients. A dependence of valence triples on
magnetic quantum numbers may be parameterized as (we use angular diagrams, see, e.g., Ref. [23])

˜ρmnrvab =

where h is a half-integer coupling angular momentum and L and L′ are integer coupling momenta. The “reduced
triples” ˜FLL′ h (mnrvab) do not depend on magnetic quantum numbers.

Selection rules for various angular momenta characterizing reduced triples follow from properties of the 3j-symbols
in the angular diagram (43). In addition, the atomic Hamiltonian is invariant under parity transformation, leading
to an additional parity selection rule lm + ln + lr + lv + la + lb = even integer for a triple amplitude ˜ρmnrvab.

Owing to the antisymmetric properties of the triples, Eq.(16), it is suﬃcient to store reduced triples with (nmκm)

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To reiterate discussion so far, we derived algebraic expressions in the CCSDvT formalism, which includes valence
triples and a subset of disconnected excitations. We also carried out angular reduction of these expressions and
developed a numerical code. In this section we present our ab initio results for properties of 3s, 3p1/2, and 3p3/2
states of atomic sodium. Results for removal energies are presented in Section IV A and for dipole matrix elements
and HFS constants A in Section IV B.

Before presenting the results, let us brieﬂy describe our numerical code. It is an extension of the relativistic SD
code [12] which employs B-spline basis set. This basis numerically approximates complete set of single-particle atomic

states. Here we use 35 out of 40 positive-energy (εi >
for singles and doubles. For triples we employ a more limited set of basis functions with lmax(Tv)
4. Excitations
from all core sub-shells are included in the calculations. Numerically we found that this choice is a reasonable
trade-oﬀ between storage and overall numerical accuracy (after all, triples aﬀect computed properties at
1% level.)
The results presented in this Section will include basis set extrapolation correction, which is obtained by computing
SD properties with increasingly larger basis sets and interpolating them to l =
. The CC equations were solved
iteratively. We notice that the reported calculations can be carried out in the memory of a modern high-end personal
workstation: storing reduced valence triples in a single precision required about 900 Mb for s1/2 states and 1.5 Gb
for p3/2 states (the latter involve more angular channels).

Computed removal energies of 3s, 3p1/2, and 3p3/2 states of atomic sodium are presented in Table I. The dominant
contribution to the energies comes from the DHF values. The remaining (correlation) contribution is given by Eq. (28).
We computed this correlation correction in several approximations: SD, SDvT, CCSD, and, ﬁnally, CCSDvT.

First we list correlation energies δESD obtained in the SD approximation. The results contain basis set extrapolation
corrections from Ref. [28]. The extrapolation corrections increase the removal energies by 5.1 cm−1 for the 3s state, 1.9
cm−1 for the 3p1/2 state, and 0.8 cm−1 for the 3p3/2. Total removal energy is Etot
SD = EDHF + δESD. At the next step
(SDvT) we include valence triple excitations, i.e., in the CC equations in addition to the SD terms we incorporate terms
with amplitudes ˜ρmnrvab. It is instructive to distinguish direct and indirect δEindir
SD eﬀects of these excitations. The
direct eﬀect of triples is δEvT, Eq.(30), while indirect eﬀect is a modiﬁcation of δESD due to eﬀect of triples through
coupling to singles and doubles. In this case, the indirect contribution is deﬁned as δEindir
δESD[SD].
We list the two types of contributions in the Table and it is clear that for all the states both contributions add
constructively, and for all the considered approximations the indirect contribution dominates over the direct one. The
total removal energy in the SDvT approximation is Etot
SD + δEvT. The totals for other
approximations are deﬁned in a similar way.

SDvT = EDHF + δESD + δEindir

SD = δESD[SDvT]

−

As we move to the CCSD approximation in Table I, we notice that here the corrective terms δEindir

SD and δECC
decrease the removal energies, while for the SDvT case the corrections increased Etot. In both cases the resulting total
energies Etot were moved away from the experimental values. Since the eﬀects of disconnected and triple excitations
are comparable and opposite in sign, simultaneous treatment of the two eﬀects is required. The results of such
treatment are listed under CCSDvT heading in the Table. Compared to the CCSD and SDvT approximations, the
CCSDvT results move into a closer, 0.01-0.03%, agreement with the experimental values.

Comparison with the previous CC-type calculations of Na removal energies is presented in the lower panel of the
Table I. SD(pvT) approximation denotes results obtained with a scheme originally proposed in Ref. [9].
In this
scheme: (i) starting from the SDvT approximation, one keeps vT contributions in the equation for valence singles
and valence energies (i.e., Dv[Tv] eﬀect is neglected) ; (ii) triples are approximated by

justiﬁed. Nevertheless, we found a substantial (a factor of three) disagreement between δEvT corrections obtained in
our (more complete) SDvT and SD(pvT) approximations.

To understand the origin of this large disagreement, we have compared individual contributions to δEvT coming
from the r.h.s. of the triples equations with the corresponding contributions in the SD(pvT) approximation. We found
that the individual terms agree at a reasonable 10% level. The discrepancy in the total value arises because there
are certain very large individual terms canceling each other. These terms are several hundred times larger then the
ﬁnal combined result. In other words there is a subtle cancelation taking place and our more sophisticated all-order
treatment profoundly aﬀects this delicate cancelation.

In addition, in Ref. [12], the explicit contributions of triples to the energies, δEvT, were computed using direct

third-order MBPT approach. Such terms are denoted in Ref. [12] as E(3)
missed in the SD approximation in the third order. A comparison of our computed δEvT with E(3)
Table II. We again observe a large discrepancy, due to substantial cancelations among contributions to E(3)
resulting enhanced sensitivity to a correct all-order treatment.

The CCSD results obtained by Eliav et al. [10] agrees with our CCSD energies for the 3p1/2 state. However, for
the 3s1/2 the two calculations disagree by 14 cm−1. This discrepancy is likely due to our omission of all non-linear
terms in the core CCSD equations.

Comparing the ﬁnal CCSDvT results for the removal energies with the experimental values (last row of Table II)
we ﬁnd an agreement at the level of 0.01-0.03%. We do not include Breit-, reduced-mass and mass-polarization
corrections to the energies, as they contribute at a much smaller level [12]. A perfect theory-experiment agreement for
the previous SD(pvT) calculations of energies [13] is fortuitous because contributions of the disconnected excitations
omitted in Ref. [29] would move the theoretical energies by about 70 cm−1 for the 3s1/2 state (see Table I).

B. Hyperﬁne constants and electric-dipole amplitudes

With the computed wave functions of the 3s, 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 states we proceed to determining magnetic-dipole
hyperﬁne-structure constants A and electric-dipole transition amplitudes. The formalism was outlined in Sec. III D
and here we discuss our ab initio results and compare them with the experimental values.

Numerical results are presented in Table III. This Table is organized as follows. First we list the DHF and SD
values. The results for the HFS constants include ﬁnite-nuclear size eﬀects (see Appendix).
In the part denoted
“All-order corrections beyond SD” we tabulate diﬀerences between the values obtained at a certain approximation
SD). The most
(CCSD, SDvT, CCSDvT) and the corresponding SD value (symbolically, e.g., ∆(CCSD) = CCSD
sophisticated approximation is CCSDvT (it includes both implicit and explicit, Eq. (35), contributions of valence
triples and implicit contribution of disconnected excitations); we will base our ﬁnal ab initio result on the CCSDvT
values. A cursory look at this part of the Table reveals that the contributions of disconnected excitations tend to
compensate contributions of valence triples for all the computed properties. This situation is similar to the one
observed by us while presenting results for removal energies in Section IV A.

While discussing the CCSDvT results, it is instructive to compare the explicit valence triple corrections to matrix
elements, Eq.(35), with a corresponding contribution from the direct fourth-order calculations [25]. In particular, for
the
wv CCSDvT contribution of -0.00075 is in a close agreement with the fourth-order
Z1×2(Tv) contribution of -0.00073. The close agrement is due to the fact that there are no strongly canceling terms
in the Z1×2(Tv) class of the fourth-order diagrams. This should be contrasted with our similar comparison of energy
corrections (see Table II), where large, a factor of 100, cancelations lead to a poor accuracy of the direct third-order
computation.

Corrections beyond the CCSDvT approximation are listed in the Table III under the heading “Complementary
corrections”. The dressing corrections arise due to a direct contribution of disconnected excitations to the matrix
elements. The details of our all-order dressing scheme can be found in Ref.[17]. Following that work we distinguish
between vertex- and line- dressing corrections. Futher, the “MBPT-IV” entries in the Table include all IVth diagrams
missed by the CCSDvT method and dressing. For example, our CCSDvT approximation discards core triples and
disconnected core excitations and these contributions arise starting from the fourth order of MBPT for matrix elements.
In notation of Ref. [24] the complementary fourth-order terms are Z0×3(Dv[Tc]), Z0×3(Sc[Tc]), and Z1×2(Tc).
In
addition, the dressing method of Ref.[17] misses so-called stretched and ladder Z1×2(Dnl) diagrams. These diagrams
are also incorporated into the value of “MBPT-IV” contribution in the Table III. We used the fourth-order code of
Ref. [25] to evaluate the complementary MBPT-IV contributions.

Finally, we tabulate Breit and QED corrections available from the literature (see Appendix for discussion). By
combining them with the CCSDvT values and the complementary corrections we arrive at the ﬁnal ab initio values in
the bottom part of Table III. Here we also present a comparison with the experimental data. In particular, the last
row tabulates percentage deviations from the experimental values. If the ab initio value lays inside the experimental
error bar, we tabulate experimental uncertainty instead. The theory-experiment agreement is better than 0.1% except
for the HFS constant of the 3p3/2 state, where our value disagrees with most accurate experimental results at 1%
level. For this constant our result is, however, in a reasonable agreement with the less accurate (0.3% uncertainty)
result of Ref. [20].

V. CONCLUSION

To reiterate here we presented a practical high-accuracy ab initio relativistic technique for calculating properties of
univalent atomic systems. The distinct formal improvements over the previous singles-doubles approach [8, 9, 12, 13]
are:

1. non-perturbative treatment of valence triple excitations;

2. incorporation of disconnected excitations (non-linear terms) in the coupled-cluster approach;

3. inclusion of complementary MBPT diagrams so that the calculations of matrix elements are complete through

the fourth-order of MBPT; these diagrams include contributions of core triples.

4. all-order “dressing” of lines and vertices in calculations of matrix elements.

Including all the enumerated eﬀects is important in reaching the present uniform “better than 0.1%” theoretical
accuracy for Na atom. In particular, a simultaneous treatment of triple and disconnected quadruple excitations is
required, as these two relatively large eﬀects tend to partially cancel each other.

13

In the framework of the developed formalism, we computed removal energies, magnetic-dipole HFS constants A and
3pj transitions. The presented approach demonstrates a uniform
electric-dipole amplitudes for the principal 3s1/2 −
sub-0.1%-accurate agreement with experimental data. In particular, we ﬁnd that the removal energies are reproduced
within 0.01-0.03% and the HFS constants of the 3s and 3p1/2 states with a better than 0.1% accuracy. The calculated
dipole amplitudes are in a perfect agreement with the 0.05%-accurate experimental data. In the case of the 3p3/2 state
HFS constant our ab initio result deviates from
0.1%-accurate experimental values [18, 19] by 1%, while agreeing
with the less accurate measurements [20, 21]. We anticipate that the relativistic many-body technique presented here
can serve as a basis of highly-accurate evaluation of parity-violating eﬀects in Cs atom and Ba+ ion [4].

APPENDIX A: SMALLER (NON-CORRELATION) CORRECTIONS TO THE HYPERFINE
STRUCTURE CONSTANTS

Calculations of magnetic hyperﬁne constants A presented in Table III were carried out with the nuclear gyromagnetic
ratio gI = 1.4784. In calculations we model the nucleus as a uniformly magnetized sphere of radius 3.83 fm. For the
3s1/2 state, the corresponding nuclear size (Breit-Weisskopf) eﬀect reduces point-nucleus results by 0.5 MHz. In an
extreme case, when magnetization is assumed to be completely localized on the nuclear surface, the Ahfs(3s1/2) is
further reduced by 0.15 MHz; this diﬀerence between the uniform and surface magnetization is below our theoretical
accuracy.

Breit and QED contributions to the HFS constant of the 3s1/2 state were calculated recently by Sapirstein and
Cheng [5]. In their notation, the value marked “Breit/QED” includes eﬀects of the Breit interaction, retardation in the
transverse photon exchange and negative-energy states, while “QED” correction encapsulates vacuum polarization
and self-energy corrections. (The Breit correction of 0.35 MHz, evaluated using analytical expression [36] is in a
reasonable agreement with the value of 0.2 MHz from [5]). As to the QED corrections, the leading Schwinger term
(anomalous magnetic moment) δA/A = α/π sets a scale for radiative corrections at 0.1% and this is comparable with
the accuracy of our calculations. Nevertheless, explicit model-potential calculation [5] of vacuum polarization and
self-energy corrections displays a large degree of cancelation between diﬀerent contributions, leading to the total QED
correction 70 times smaller than the Schwinger term.

Following discussion of Ref. [37] for Li, we also analyzed the following smaller corrections to the HFS constant: (i)
10−3 %; here Mnuc is the nuclear
Mass scaling. This eﬀect contributes at the relative level of 1/(1 + me/Mnuc)3
×
i>j ∇i · ∇j into the
mass. (ii) Mass polarization. It occurs due to an additional introduction of the term
atomic Hamiltonian, µ being the reduced mass of the electron. We expect that this term would contribute at the
10−5 %. (iii) Second order in magnetic-dipole HFS interaction. It contributes at the
relative level of 1/Mnuc(αZ)2
10−5 % level. All the enumerated corrections are below the level of theoretical accuracy of the calculation presented
here.

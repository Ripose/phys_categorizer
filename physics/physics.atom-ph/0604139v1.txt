Abstract. We calculate the rates of formation and detection of ultracold Cs2
molecules obtained from the photoassociation of ultracold atoms through the double-
well 0−
g (6S1/2 + 6P3/2) state. We concentrate on two features previously observed
experimentally and attributed to tunneling between the two wells [Vatasescu et al
2000 Phys. Rev. A 61 044701]. We show that the molecules obtained are in strongly
bound levels (v′′ = 5, 6) of the metastable a3Σ+
u (6S1/2 + 6S1/2) ground electronic state.

Ultracold cesium molecules by photoassociation with tunneling

1. Introduction

The control of elementary interactions between atoms or molecules in the gas phase is a
long term concern for researchers, namely in order to ﬁnd ways towards the full control
of a chemical reaction, giving the ability to choose the reaction path unambiguously
In this context, cooling and trapping of atoms has

opened an entirely new ﬁeld of investigation, as the particles can be brought almost to
rest, in a well-deﬁned state for both their internal and external motions. A spectacular
example is provided by the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in alkali gases
[1, 2, 3], recently followed by the demonstration of quantum degeneracy in a fermionic
alkali gas [4].

Cooling of molecules, despite the inherent diﬃculty caused by the complex
internal molecular structure, represents an increasingly active research ﬁeld with many
achievements since the ﬁrst observation of ultracold Cs2 molecules by photoassociation
of laser-cooled cesium atoms [5]. Two approaches have been proven to be very eﬃcient,
namely Stark deceleration [6] and buﬀer gas cooling [7]. Other promising methods rely
on phase space ﬁltering of a molecular beam [8], on billiard-like collisions [9], or on
a gas expansion out of a rotating nozzle [10]. A major breakthrough has been the
observation of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, using magnetic ﬁeld tunability of
Feshbach resonances [11, 12].

Among the various approaches, the photoassociation (PA) process is very attractive,
as it starts from a pair of ultracold atoms which absorbs a photon to form an ultracold
molecule in a short-lived excited electronic state [13]. The main drawback is that the
stabilization of the excited molecule into stable electronic states hardly provides an
ensemble of molecules in a well-deﬁned internal state, as it relies on spontaneous emission
which populates many vibrational levels. Some attempts to use stimulated emission have
been reported [14, 15], but they were limited to the transition into high-lying levels.
Indeed, due to the poor spatial overlap of the wave function of the photoassociated level
— predominant at large interatomic distances — with the wave function of the lowest
vibrational levels of the stabilized molecules, it is very diﬃcult to create a signiﬁcant
proportion of ultracold molecules in their absolute ground state. A ﬁrst indication of the
possibility to form ultracold molecules in their absolute ground state has been provided
in [16] for K2 molecules using a two-step photoassociation process. Very recently, a
multistep excitation/deexcitation scheme has been set up to produce a fair amount of
RbCs ultracold molecules in the v = 0 level of the electronic ground state [17].

The purpose of this paper is to describe a possible way to ﬁll these objectives,
in the particular case of the formation of ultracold Cs2 molecules, using a single-

large distances, tunneling and resonant spin-orbit coupling at short distances, and ﬁnal
stabilization by spontaneous decay towards a few low-lying vibrational levels of a stable
molecular state. We ﬁrst invoked such a process for the interpretation of so-called “giant
lines” observed in photoassociation spectra in [18], hereafter referred to as paper I.

One of us also performed a time-dependent analysis of the tunneling process in such
ultracold conditions, helpful for the determination of the characteristic times of the
tunneling motion [19]. From the present calculations involving the available extensive
photoassociative spectroscopy of Cs2, we demonstrate that the ultracold molecules are
created with a very narrow distribution of vibrational levels, peaking at v′′ = 5, 6 of the
theoretical potential curve of the Cs2 metastable triplet state. This could be the ﬁrst
example of the formation of ultracold molecules left mainly in a single deep vibrational
level via single-photon PA. We present our calculation of the photoassociation rate,
of the cold molecule formation rate, and of the molecular ion signal resulting from
the photoionization of the stabilized cold molecules. This emphasizes the role of the
detection process in the interpretation of the strong intensity of these giant lines observed
in the photoassociation spectrum.

We start in section 2 by recalling the main facts concerning the tunneling eﬀects in
the photoassociation of Cs2. We then present the model used to calculate the molecule
formation rates (section 3), followed by the results of the simulations for the Cs+
2
ionization signals (section 4). Finally, concluding remarks are given in section 5.

2. Experimental and theoretical facts on giant lines and tunneling in the
PA of cesium

We brieﬂy recall below the main results of paper I. The PA process between two ultracold
cesium atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), shown in ﬁgure 1, is written as

Cs(6s2S1/2, F = 4) + Cs(6s2S1/2, F = 4) + ¯h(ωD2 − ∆L)
→ Cs2(0

−
g (6s2S1/2 + 6p2P3/2; v, J)).

(1)

The pair of cold cesium atoms absorbs a photon detuned by ∆L to the red of the D2
atomic transition frequency ωD2, to populate rovibrational levels of the external well of
the double-well-shaped 0−
g molecular state correlated to the 6S1/2 + 6P3/2 dissociation
limit (hereafter labeled 0−
g (P3/2)). These levels are detected by two well-established
methods: ﬁrst through the ﬂuorescence variations of the atomic trap induced by their
spontaneous decay towards bound levels or towards the dissociation continuum of the
lowest a3Σ+
u (6S1/2 + 6S1/2) state, second through the resonant two-photon ionization
(R2PI) of the ultracold molecules formed in this metastable triplet state into Cs+
2
molecular ions. The latter method delivers a very neat spectrum with excellent signal-to-
noise ratio. Typical experimental conditions are temperatures between 20 and 200 µK,
a mean atomic density of about 4 × 1010 cm−3 with a peak density of 1011 cm−3, the
number of atoms being estimated between 2 to 5 × 107 atoms, and intensities of 50
up to 500 W/cm2 for the the photoassociation laser [20]. The full R2PI spectrum for
the 0−
g (P3/2) has been analyzed in [21], yielding a very precise determination of the
corresponding potential curve through the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) analysis, and
through an approach based on the asymptotic modeling of the atom-atom interactions
[22]. Vibrational levels from vext = 0 to vext = 132 have been identiﬁed [23] in the

vext = 72.

In addition, two intense structures with a large rotational splitting (hereafter
referred to as “giant lines”, following paper I, and labeled G1 and G2) are superimposed
on lines associated to levels of the 0−
g external well (ﬁgure 1). The most intense line
within the G1 (G2) feature was assigned to J = 3 (J = 0, 1) at ∆L = −2.14 cm−1
(∆L = −6.15 cm−1) superimposed on vext = 103 (vext = 80), while weak lines assigned
up to J = 6 were detected providing a rotational constant BG1
v = 137 ± 4 MHz
(BG2

v = 243 ± 8 MHz).

With the help of a coupled-channel model, the G1 and G2 features have been
assigned in paper I to levels which tunnel through the potential barrier between the two
wells of the 0−
g (P3/2) state, as schematized in ﬁgure 1. Their large rotational structure
is induced by the vibrational motion in two coupled vibrational levels of the 0−
g (P3/2)
internal well, which is coupled to several levels in the external well (only two of them
are drawn in ﬁgure 1 for better clarity). The tunneling eﬀect, unusual for a heavy

molecule like Cs2, is then an eﬃcient mechanism to transfer the vibrational motion
of the photoassociated state from large interatomic distances towards the inner zone:
in contrast with the long-range molecular states usually reached by PA, spontaneous
emission of the tunneling levels can stabilize the photoassociated molecules into low
vibrational levels of the a3Σ+
u metastable state, creating then ultracold molecules with
a rather cold vibrational motion. Let us note that the internal state of the molecules
created has not been probed experimentally yet.

there is no available spectroscopic determination of the 0−
g (P3/2) inner well, this
external well is matched to the curve computed by Spies and Meyer [24], through a
potential barrier whose height and position have been adjusted in paper I in order
to reproduce the experimental observations. The potential barrier then culminates at
2 cm−1 above the 6S1/2 + 6P3/2 dissociation limit. Furthermore, according to [24],
the 0−

state (hereafter labeled 0−
g (5D3/2)) through a non-adiabatic coupling generated by spin-
orbit interaction. The 0−
g (P3/2) and 0−
g (5D3/2) curves then exhibit a well-localized
avoided crossing around 10a0, which we transformed into a real crossing by linearizing
the curves around the crossing to determine the corresponding standard Landau-Zener
coupling parameters. We imposed a ﬁnite range for the coupling using the Gaussian
form A exp [−(r − r0)2/w2] with r0 = 10.02, w = 2, and A = 0.000258 (all in atomic
units). We recall that the absence of resonant coupling between levels of the internal
wells would result into a single tunneling level, instead of the two levels assigned in the
experiment [18].

g (P3/2) and 0−

For each value of J, the radial Schr¨odinger equation is solved with the Mapped
Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (MFGH) method [25], providing accurate vibrational energies
EvJ , wave functions χvJ (R), and rotational constants BvJ = hχvJ |¯h2/(2µR2)|χvJ i (where
µ = 121135.83 a.u. is the Cs2 reduced mass) of the two coupled state. It is well known
that tunneling through a potential barrier is very sensitive to its shape and to the
position in energy with respect to the top of the barrier. These eﬀect are magniﬁed here
as the two tunneling levels of the 0−
g (5D3/2) internal wells, hereafter referred
to as v6P and v5D, respectively, interact resonantly with the dense — but not continuous
— energy level spectrum of the external well.
In order to maximize tunneling, we
adjusted the relative position of the two internal wells to create an almost half-and-half
mixing of the v6P and v5D radial wave functions. Our model actually presents a many
tunable parameters for such an adjustment: indeed, the internal well of the potentials,
as well as their coupling, are unknown experimentally, so that their ﬁne tuning is quite
tedious. We also noted that the tunneling eﬀect is very sensitive to the value of J. In
order to facilitate the convergence, we stopped the adjustment when we found maximal
tunneling for an arbitrary J value. In other words, we also considered the rotational
number J as a tunable parameter, which we will label as ¯J in the following. An example
of the resulting wave functions is shown in ﬁgure 2), where the maximal tunneling eﬀect
is found for the value ¯J = 5. This is clearly not in agreement with the rotational

for the G2 resonance at −5.87 cm−1, almost degenerate with a level of the external well
at −5.89 cm−1: the wave functions have signiﬁcant amplitude over the barrier range.
The ¯J = 0 case (panels d and e) is also shown for comparison: the energy matching is
less favorable and the wave functions hardly penetrate the potential barrier. Panel (a)
displays a typical radial wave function of the initial collisional state for a temperature

calculations of the next section, which will be evaluated without any J dependence. The
corresponding numerical data is available on request from the authors.

Even if in the adjustment procedure above we used ¯J as a parameter, ﬁgure 3
shows that the selectivity of the tunneling process is very strongly dependent on the
rotational level. The value of BvJ deﬁned above is very sensitive to the repartition of
the wave function inside the two wells, and panel (a) in ﬁgure 3 reﬂects the pattern
shown in ﬁgure 2), where the value for ¯J = 5 is intermediate between the rotational
constant of levels in the internal well (≈ 0.008 cm−1) and of levels of the external well

(≈ 0.0005 cm−1). Similarly, the ¯J = 3 line for G1 also reﬂects the extension of the wave
function over both wells. ¯J = 5 displays the same behavior, which can be understood as
the rotational structure of G1 has the same magnitude as the energy spacing between
vibrational levels of the external well, so that it is resonant with vext = 104 in our
calculations. This aspect was not present in the model we set up in paper I and conﬁrms
what is observed experimentally. Indeed, due to the ultracold temperature, the s-wave
regime is expected to dominate the initial collision between the two Cs atoms (yielding
J = 0, 1, 2) with probably a small contribution of the p wave (yielding J = 1, 2, 3). The
presence of higher values of J at such low temperatures is not yet fully understood [23].
The relative intensities of the J = 0, 1, 2 experimental lines approximately reﬂects their
2J + 1 degeneracy, and the J = 2 line has indeed the strongest intensity for most of the
PA lines assigned to the levels of the 0−
g (P3/2) external well. The lines with larger J
values are weaker, due to the small contribution of higher partial waves involved in the
collision. We see that this hierarchy is not preserved for G1 and G2: the intense lines
are associated to those rotational levels which are indeed resonant with a level of the
internal well, i.e., J = 3 and J = 0, 1, respectively.

3. Photoassociation and cold molecule formation rates for tunneling levels

The metastable a3Σ+
u (6S1/2 + 6S1/2) state is represented by the potential curve of [26],
Cn/Rn (n = 6, 8, 10),
matched beyond 20a0 to the standard asymptotic expansion
with Cn coeﬃcients taken from [27]. The repulsive wall of the potential is slightly
changed in order to reproduce a large and positive scattering length [28]. We work
here with aT = 2370a0, which satisfactorily reproduces the intensity envelope of the
PA spectrum of [23]. The initial scattering radial wave function is computed through a
standard Numerov integration at an energy E/kBT = 150 µK above the 6S1/2 + 6S1/2
asymptote, ignoring the hyperﬁne structure (ﬁgure 2a). Let us note that the accuracy
of the aT and Cn values is not crucial for the following calculation of the rates, which
can be determined experimentally typically within a factor of 2.

The photoassociation and cold molecule formation rates are evaluated according to
the perturbative model already presented in previous papers [20, 29, 30]. Brieﬂy, the

the rate formulas.

Figure 4a displays the overlap between the continuum wave function and the bound
states of coupled potentials, equation (3), lying in the energy interval between −9 and
−1.5 cm−1, for both J = 0 and J = 5. As expected, G1 and G2 have smaller overlap with
the initial continuum than the external well levels, due to the weaker probability of wave
functions to be localized at large distances. In contrast with the PA rate, the branching
ratio of the G1 and G2 wave functions is enhanced due to their good localization at
short distances (ﬁgure 4b). As it was often emphasized, a good production of cold
molecules requires a favorable ratio between free-bound and bound-bound transitions.
The product O(E, ¯v, ¯J) × Rbr(¯v, ¯J) is represented in ﬁgure 4c. If for G1 the eﬃciency
seems certain, we see that for G2 this balance is fragile and depends indeed on the
¯J value which makes tunneling eﬀective. On the right axis of this ﬁgure is reported
the rate for cold molecule formation, equation (4), for typical experimental conditions
nat = 1011 cm−3 and a PA laser intensity I = 100 W/cm2. It is found two times and
eight times larger than the rate for the vext levels for G2 and G1, respectively. Even if in
the experiment the intensities of the G2 and G1 lines are found to be comparable (see
insets in ﬁgure 1), our results conﬁrm that the cold molecule formation rate is indeed
larger than the rate for the vext levels. The relative intensity of the G2 and G1 lines may
be inﬂuenced by the two-photon ionization used for the detection (see next section).
Let us note also that the rate computed for the vext levels is in agreement with the one
reported in [20], where Rmol ≈ 0.2 s−1 was measured at a detuning of 7 cm−1, for a PA
laser intensity I = 55 W/cm2.

peak markedly at v′′ = 5, 6, conﬁrming the eﬃciency of the PA into the tunneling

4. Modeling the ionization signal

In cesium PA experiments [5, 18], the cold molecules are detected via a two-photon
levels of
ionization process, where the ﬁrst photon is resonant with rovibrational
molecular states correlated to the 6S1/2 + 5D3/2 dissociation limit. Therefore, the
ionization signal is very sensitive to the wavelength chosen for the ionization laser.
Following our previous studies of this process [30, 31], we simulate the contributions
of G1 and G2 to the Cs+
g (6S1/2 + 6P3/2) level
detuned by ∆L, spontaneous emission towards v′′(a3Σ+
u ) bound levels, and ionization
with a photon of frequency νion of these levels through absorption into levels v′ of the
(2)3Πg(6S1/2 + 5D5/2) potential. In this model, the second step of the ionization process

As in the cold molecules rate calculation, we neglect the R dependence of the dipole
transition moment involved in the spontaneous decay step. In equation (7), the number
of molecules NPA(∆L) accumulated during the photoassociation step is deﬁned by
multiplying the PA rate RPA(∆L) with the number of atoms nPA in the photoassociation
area with the residence time tPA of the cold molecules within the trapping region:

photoassociation into (a) the G1 and (b) the G2 states. In the latter case, rates for
both levels contributing to G2 are given, i.e., the level at −5.87 cm−1 tunneling from
the inner wells (black closed circles) and the external level tunneling from the outer
well at −5.89 cm−1 (red open circles). The calculation is made for nat = 10011 cm−3
and an intensity I = 100 W/cm2 for the PA laser.

In the Cesium PA experiment, typical values for these parameters are nPA = 5 × 107
and tPA ≈ 10 ms. The excitation probability Pion(v′′) of the v′′ levels into vibrational

2 ions signal (in arbitrary units) as a function of the frequency of the
ionization laser, calculated with equation (7) for detunings ∆L corresponding to G1
(right column) and G2 (left column). Signals corresponding to photoassociation in
vibrational levels located close to G1 and G2 and belonging to the external well of
the 0−
g (6S1/2 + 6P3/2) potential are also shown. The energy of the 6S1/2 + 5D5/2
dissociation limit is taken as being 14597.08 cm−1 above the 6S1/2 + 6S1/2 origin.

amounts of molecular ions are detected only for speciﬁc frequencies corresponding to
the resonance condition in the ﬁrst step. The signals coming from G1 and G2 are clearly
more intense than those of the surrounding levels, in agreement with the experimental
spectrum [18], because of the increased eﬃciency for forming cold molecules in bound
levels of the triplet state. The signal corresponding to G1, having a maximum of
0.03 in ﬁgure 6e, is ﬁve times bigger that the simulated G2 signal, whose maximum
reaches 0.006 if we take the sum of the two contributing levels (ﬁgures 6a,b). This ratio
between the intensities of the simulated “giant lines” is larger than in the experimental
spectrum where the ratio is only two [23]. This could be due to the fact that the
ionization spectra for the tunneling resonances do not match perfectly: the diﬀerences
in vibrational distributions v′′(a3Σ+
u ) of G1 and G2 (see ﬁgure 5) make it possible to
chose an ionization frequency (e.g., hνion ≈ 14101 or 14117 cm−1) such that the ratio
between the two ion signals is greatly modiﬁed, as shown in ﬁgure 7.

5. Conclusion

As demonstrated through several studies [5, 18, 31], cesium atoms are well-suited for
ultracold molecule formation through photoassociation, mainly due to the peculiarity of
some of the excited states of the Cs2 molecule. Of particular interest is the 0−
g (S1/2+P3/2)
state, which is composed of two potential wells separated by a barrier whose height
culminates at an energy close to the dissociation asymptote. This allows for tunneling
between the two wells, enabling a pair of atoms initially far apart to come close together
in a photoassociated molecule.

We have shown here that this tunneling process leads to strongly bound ultracold
cesium molecules in the metastable a3Σ+
u (S1/2 + S1/2) ground electronic state. Indeed,
it is mostly vibrational levels around v′′ = 5, 6 that are populated, in contrast to what
can be reached for non-tunneling states of the external 0−
g (P3/2) well (v′′ > 23 [20]).
The tunneling eﬃciency is seen to be markedly dependent upon the rotational state J,
in accord with what was observed experimentally [18].

Finally, we have investigated that the experimental detection scheme, resonant two-
photon ionization, inﬂuences the observation of ultracold Cs2 molecules. Evidence would
suggest that the detection process aﬀects the relative intensities seen in the signal, as
was the case previously [31]. In other words, the molecules produced are not all ionized
with the same eﬃciency, and it is therefore important to consider this step in the analysis
of photoassociation experiments.

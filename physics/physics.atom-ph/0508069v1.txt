Fluorescence Detectors with Fast Overdrive Recovery

Abstract

Two large-area, low noise, high speed ﬂuorescence detectors have been built. One detector consists of a photodiode
with an area of 28 mm x 28 mm and a low noise transimpedance ampliﬁer. This detector has a input light-equivalent
spectral noise density of less than 3 pW/√Hz, can recover from a large scattered light pulse within 10 µs, and has a
bandwidth of at least 900 kHz. The second detector consists of a 16 mm diameter avalanche photodiode and a low-noise
transimpedance ampliﬁer. This detector has an input light-equivalent spectral noise density of 0.08 pW/√Hz, also can
recover from a large scattered light pulse within 10 µs, and has a bandwidth of 1 MHz.
Introduction

Thus,

Two large-area, high speed, photodiode-based ﬂuores-
cence detectors have been built to detect ﬂuorescence from
molecules excited via a pulsed laser system. Both detec-
tors have a large area to allow for collection of light from a
large solid angle and are fast to allow for good time resolu-
tion of the ﬂuorescence. Since the high intensity of pulsed
laser systems inevitably scatters a signiﬁcant number of
photons into the detector, both detectors are designed to
quickly recover from a large pulse of light that would oth-
erwise saturate the detector for the duration of the ﬂuores-
cence signal.

While photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) can also be used to
measure ﬂuorescence after excitation with a pulsed laser,
photodiodes and avalanche photodiodes (APDs) have sev-
eral advantages.
Photodiodes typically have a much
higher quantum efﬁciency (q.e.) than PMTs. For exam-
ple, at 550 nm (where this detector is used) PMTs have
85%
20% while Silicon PIN photodiodes have q.e.
q.e.
and the APD used in this detector has q.e.
80%. Further-
more, photodiodes have a more linear response to light
intensity than PMTs and can withstand higher sustained
ﬂuxes.

One of these detectors will be used in an experiment
that intends to improve the sensitivity to an electron elec-
tric dipole moment (EDM)[1]. The experiment detects
small energy shifts in an excited state of PbO that would
result from a non-zero EDM. The energy shifts are mea-
sured with quantum beat spectroscopy [2], which in this
case appears as a sinusoidal modulation at 200-500 kHz
superimposed on an exponential decay due to the spon-
taneous emission of an excited state of PbO. In order to
maximize the solid angle of detection, large area photodi-
odes or APDs are used. The Hamamatsu S3584-08 silicon
PIN photodiode has an area of 28 mm x 28 mm and the
Advanced Photonix 630-70-73-500 APD has a diameter
of 16 mm.

While PMTs have an intrinsic nearly noise-free
gain stage, PIN photodiodes do not and the gain in

APDs is smaller than the desired gain.
low
noise transimpedance preampliﬁers are necessary for the
photodiode-based detectors. There were three require-
ments for the design of the preampliﬁers in our experi-
ment. First, the intrinsic noise of the ampliﬁers must be
less than the anticipated shot noise, so that the ampliﬁer
noise will not signiﬁcantly contribute to the overall noise
on the detected signal. Second, since the photodiode or
APD is exposed to a large pulse of scattered light from
the excitation laser, the preampliﬁer must be able to re-
cover quickly from such a pulse. We speciﬁcally require
recovery in .10 µs, since the excited state has a lifetime
of 50 µs under the current conditions. Finally, to allow for
unattenuated detection of quantum beats at
500 kHz, the
preampliﬁer must have a bandwidth of &1 MHz.

II Low noise ampliﬁcation

The noise of a transimpedance ampliﬁer can be modelled
as shown in ﬁgure 1[4]. All noise components will be
calculated at the output of the transimpedance ampliﬁer.
A real photodiode can be modelled as an ideal photodiode
in parallel with a capacitor Cj and a shunt resistor Rj, plus
resistance Rs in series with the other components. Cf and
Rf are the feedback capacitance and resistance and Ca is
the ampliﬁer input capacitance.

All of the resistances in this model have intrinsic John-
son noise. The voltage noise spectral density eJ across a
resistance R is given by eJ = √4kBT R. At the output of
the ampliﬁer, the Johnson noise of Rj contributes

0.5 nV/√Hz. These JFETs do not have enough gain to

Ω, so this stage is followed by an operational ampliﬁer[6].
The JFET input stage provides a low-noise ampliﬁcation
stage before the noisier second stage op-amp. The gain of
the JFET ampliﬁer is sufﬁciently large that the input noise
of the op-amp is negligible.

×

The input voltage noise en can be further reduced by
putting m JFETs in parallel resulting in a combined noise
of en=eJF ET /√m. In principle, many JFETs can be used
to improve the noise of the ampliﬁer, but in practice there
are two limitations. The ultra-low noise JFETs used here
have a signiﬁcant gate-source capacitance CJF ET . Since
the noise at the output of the ampliﬁer at high frequencies

little improvement to the noise once en . eJ,s.

Requirements for the second stage of ampliﬁcation

voltage gain of the entire preampliﬁer is Gv,cl

only G1

of gm = 0.02 S and the drain resistance of 3 kΩ. The

≈

∼

Miller effect signiﬁcantly reduces the gain of the JFET
stage at high frequencies, so a cascode conﬁguration was
used to reduce this effect[8]. Even with the cascode, the
second stage ampliﬁer must have a high gain and wide
bandwidth so that the open loop gain is large enough. We
use the Analog Devices AD797, which which has a gain
bandwidth product GBW of 110 MHz, and has en2 = 0.9
nV/√Hz.
In addition to the high GBW of the AD797,
this op-amp was chosen for its fast recovery from over-
drive, which allows it to quickly recovery from the scat-
tered light pulse.

B APD

≈

The noise design of the transimpedance ampliﬁer for the
APD is much less stringent since the bias voltage is cho-
sen so the APD gain G
200. The shot noise at the output
of the APD is thus √2G larger than the noise in the PIN
photodiode. We choose Rf =2 kΩ in the transimpedance
ampliﬁer for the APD, resulting in shot noise at the output
of the ampliﬁer δVsn = 100nV /√Hz. Having chosen Rf
and knowing that Cj =140 pF for this APD, it is possible to
make some estimates of which noise terms are signiﬁcant.
We ﬁnd that Rj and Rs have insigniﬁcant noise contribu-
tions. Since the noise requirements are much less strict
for this ampliﬁer, no front-end JFET was used. Instead
the transimpedance ampliﬁer is made from a single op-
amp, the AD797, which has again been chosen for its high
GBW and fast overdrive recovery time. The AD797 has
en = 0.9 nV/√Hz and in = 2.0 pA/√Hz. At the output

The voltage noise is almost insigniﬁcant since eout,n

1.3 nV/√Hz. The current noise is the largest expected
3.7 nV/√Hz. The vari-
noise contribution at eout,i
ous noise contributions along with the measured noise are
shown in ﬁgure 3.

∼

∼

There are two other noise sources that are signiﬁcant
with the APD detector, but not the photodiode detector.
The ﬁrst is the shot noise in the dark current of the APD
esn,dc. In this case, this shot noise is negligible compared
to the shot noise on the expected signal. The second is
the noise on the bias voltage for the APD. The photodiode
bias voltage was supplied by batteries, but the necessary
high bias voltage for the APD makes it difﬁcult to supply
with batteries. A high voltage power supply was used and
ﬁltered to provide acceptable noise characteristics for the
APD detector.

intensity beams scatter photons into the detector causing
a large, but temporally short burst of photoelectrons. In
many cases, this scattered light pulse is several orders of
magnitude larger than the expected signal size, and can
easily saturate the detector system. In our case, the tran-
simpedance ampliﬁer must be able to recover from this
scattered light pulse, which is injected in a
5 ns duration,
quickly in order to observe the spontaneous ﬂuorescence.
We deﬁne the recovery time as the time that it takes the
ampliﬁer to ring down to 1/e of the saturated value.

∼

The recovery time of the ampliﬁer depends on the size
of the scattered light pulse. For this experiment, it was
necessary to choose optical ﬁlters that reduced the signal
size, but also reduced the scattered light. The two ﬁltering
options we considered allowed for a scattered light pulse
that injected a charge of either 220 nC or 1.5 nC at the ex-
pense of a factor of 3 smaller desirable signal in the latter
case. The photodiode and APD both took more than 50 µs
to recover from the 220 nC pulse and
10µs to recover
from the 1.5 nC pulse. The recovery time as a function of
injected charge from scattered light is shown in ﬁgure 4
for both detectors.

≈

Three changes were made to the design of the tran-
simpedance ampliﬁers to improve the recovery time. First,
clamping diodes were placed between the output of the
photodiode or APD and ground to shunt large input light
signals to ground. Small signal and Schottky diodes were
used and both kinds were chosen for their low capacitance
so as not to signiﬁcantly contribute to Ci. The Schottky
diodes were chosen for their low forward voltage drop,
and the small signal diodes were chosen for their higher
current ratings. These diodes are placed in opposite di-

rections to damp additional electronic ringing due to the
scattered light pulse.

The second and third changes were only applied to the
photodiode ampliﬁer. Here, diodes were placed in the
feedback loop to allow for a low resistance path when the
ampliﬁer was saturated. These diodes were not necessary
in the APD ampliﬁer because Rf is much smaller. The
cascode in the JFET stage improved the recovery time by
increasing the bandwidth of this stage of the ampliﬁer.

Preliminary circuit designs used two additional meth-
ods of improving the recovery time, but these methods
were not successful enough to be used in the ﬁnal design.
The ﬁrst method was to add a power booster in the feed-
back loop for the photodiode detector. This power booster
was able to source more current through the diodes in the
feedback loop of this detector in an attempt to shorten the
recovery time. In this application, it was difﬁcult to im-
plement the power booster as it made the feedback traces
larger, and Cf difﬁcult to minimize. The second method
was to add an additional photodiode at the input of the
transimpedance ampliﬁer with opposite orientation to the
detecting photodiode. A laser diode shone into the ad-
ditional diode providing some charge cancellation during
the scattered light pulse. However, the improvement in
recovery time was found to be negligible.

capacitance of 0.2 pF, it is necessary to keep all other pos-
sible capacitances extremely low. For this reason, three
200 kΩ resistors were used in series to create the feedback
resistor. Additionally, the circuit board was designed to
keep the traces relating to the components in the feedback
loop as short as possible by placing feedback components
on the opposite side of the circuit board from the amplify-
ing components. Ground planes were placed on all avail-
able surfaces on the circuit board and two inner layers of
the circuit board were also grounded. The 3dB bandwidth
of the circuit was measured as

The smaller Rf in the APD ampliﬁer makes it much
less sensitive to frequency limitations and this ampliﬁer
could be made to have a bandwidth of at least 10 MHz if
necessary. Our present APD detector has a bandwidth of
1 MHz.

V Final Design

The ﬁnal design incorporated all of the elements discussed
above. The circuit diagram for the PIN photodiode detec-
tor is shown in ﬁgure 6. The circuit boards were designed
with great care to minimize the path lengths at the input
of the ampliﬁer. These short paths reduce capacitive ef-
fects and noise pickup from other sources. Surface mount
components were used wherever possible to reduce lead
size. All cables leading to or from the circuit board are
made of coaxial cable. The power supplies for the pho-
todiode detector were also constructed to minimize noise.
The design of the power supplies is shown in ﬁgure 7.

The ﬁnal design for the APD detector is shown in ﬁgure
8. The power supply for the bias voltage was ﬁltered to
remove high frequency noise components.

VI Summary

The large-area (7.8 cm2) PIN photodiode detector de-
scribed here has an input light-equivalent noise of less than
3 pW/√Hz at a wavelength of 550 nm, can recover in 10
µs from large scattered light pulses that rapidly inject 1.5
nC of charge, and has a bandwidth of more than 900 kHz.
The noise was minimized by using a large feedback resis-
tance to minimize Johnson noise, JFETs as the ﬁrst stage
of the ampliﬁer to en, and low noise power supplies. The
recovery time from the scattered light was reduced by us-
ing clamping diodes on the input and in the feedback, and
with a cascode conﬁguration on the JFET front end. The
bandwidth was achieved by minimizing all capacitances.
The ﬁnal design for the large-area (2.0 cm2) APD detec-
tor has an input light-equivalent noise of 0.08 pW/√Hz,
can recovery quickly from large scattered light pulses and

Figure 8: Circuit Diagram for the APD detector. D1 is
the APD, and is the 630-70-73-500 from Advanced Pho-
tonix, chosen for its large area. D2 is a BAS70-04 Schot-
tky diode, chosen for its low forward voltage and low ca-
pacitance. D3 is a HSMP-3822-BLK diode chosen for low
capacitance. U1 is an AD797, chosen for low-noise, high
speed and fast overdrive recovery. U2 is an AD829, a high
speed cable driver with fast overdrive recovery.

the anticipated level of 0.6 µA, with quantum beats at 500
kHz, are shown as measured with the APD. These signals
were simulated with an LED driven by an arbitrary wave-
form generator programmed to simulate the beat signal.
The trace in ﬁgure 9 includes scattered light equivalent to
1.5 nC of charge injection.

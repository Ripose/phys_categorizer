We describe a method of selective generation and study of polarization moments of up to the
highest rank κ = 2F possible for a quantum state with total angular momentum F . The technique
is based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with frequency-modulated light. Various polarization
moments are distinguished by the periodicity of light-polarization rotation induced by the atoms
during Larmor precession and exhibit distinct light-intensity and frequency dependences. We apply
the method to study polarization moments of 87Rb atoms contained in a vapor cell with antirelax-
ation coating. Distinct ultra-narrow (1-Hz wide) resonances, corresponding to diﬀerent multipoles,
appear in the magnetic-ﬁeld dependence of the optical rotation. The use of the highest-multipole
resonances has important applications in quantum and nonlinear optics and in magnetometry.

High-rank polarization moments (PM) and associated
high-order coherences have recently drawn attention (see
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and references therein) because
they may enhance nonlinear optical eﬀects important in
applications such as electromagnetically induced trans-
parency [9], creation of nonclassical atomic and photonic
states [10], realization of photon blockades [11], quantum
gates [12], photonic switches [13], and atomic magnetom-
etry [14, 15].

While signatures of high-order PM were detected in
several experiments [3, 4, 5, 6, 8], the methods used in
these investigations are not suﬃciently selective and/or
do not allow real-time manipulation of particular mul-
tipoles. Here we describe a method, based on nonlin-
ear optical rotation with frequency-modulated light (FM
NMOR) [16], by which one can selectively induce, con-
trol, and study any possible multipole moment. Apply-
ing the method to 87Rb atoms in a paraﬃn-coated cell
[17, 18], we have veriﬁed the expected power and spectral
dependences of the resonant signals and obtained a quan-
titative comparison of relaxation rates for the even-rank
moments.

The density matrix in the M, M ′ representation for a
state with total angular momentum F can be decom-
posed into PM of rank κ = 0 . . . 2F , uncoupled under
rotations, with components q = −κ . . . κ:

tization axis,

lated to coherences between Zeeman sublevels for which
∆M = M − M ′ = q, while q = 0 components depend on
sublevel populations. Thus, coherences ρM,M ′ contribute
to all PM with κ ≥ |∆M | and a |∆M | = 2F coherence

FIG. 1: Polarization moments visualized as discussed in [20]
with surfaces for which the distance to the origin in a given
direction is proportional to the probability of ﬁnding the pro-
jection M = F along this direction. (a): “pure” quadrupole
κ = 2, q = 0; (b): κ = 4, q = 0 hexadecapole; (c): same as
in (b), but rotated by π/2 around the x-axis; (d): the aver-
age of (b) and (c), which has a 4-fold symmetry with respect
to rotations around ˆx. In all cases, the minimum necessary
amount of ρ(0)

tions are non-negative [20]. Probability surfaces (a) and (d)

frequency correspond to the polarization states produced in
this experiment.

is uniquely associated with the highest PM for a given
state, e.g., the quadrupole moment (κ = 2) for F = 1,
or the hexadecapole (κ = 4) for F = 2. The method in-
troduced here exploits the diﬀerent axial symmetries of
the PM (2-fold and 4-fold for the quadrupole and hex-
adecapole, respectively; Fig. 1) to selectively create and
detect them (see also [3, 4, 5, 6]).

While multipole moments of rank κ ≤ 2 can be easily
generated and detected with weak light (since a photon
has spin one), higher-rank moments require multi-photon
interactions for both production and detection.
In the
present method, we use a single laser beam (which is still
of sub-mW power) for the nonlinear interactions required
to pump and probe the high-multipole moments.

Under conditions of our experiment, FM NMOR
(Fig. 2) can be understood as a three-stage (pump, pre-

cession, probe) process: atoms are polarized in an in-
teraction with the laser beam (whose diameter is much
smaller than the vapor cell dimensions), then leave the
beam and bounce around the cell while undergoing Lar-
mor precession, and ﬁnally return into the laser beam re-
gion and undergo the “probe” interaction. The laser light
is frequency modulated, causing the optical pumping and
probing to acquire a periodic time dependence. When
the pumping rate is synchronized with the precession of
atomic polarization, a resonance occurs and the atomic
medium is pumped into a polarized state which rotates
around the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at the Larmor
frequency ΩL. The optical properties of the medium are
modulated at the frequency κΩL, due to the symmetry
of atomic polarization with rank κ. For example, for the
quadrupole moment the modulation is at 2ΩL, and for
the hexadecapole it is at 4ΩL [Fig. 1(a,d)]. This peri-
odic change of the optical properties of the atomic vapor
modulates the angle of the light polarization, leading to
the FM NMOR resonances. If the time-dependent opti-
cal rotation is measured at the ﬁrst harmonic of Ωm, a
resonance is seen when Ωm coincides with κΩL (Fig. 3)
[25].

At the resonance for a PM of rank κ (which should
be absent for states with 2F ≤ κ) we expect the signal
amplitude to go as the κ-th power of light intensity at
low intensities, as discussed below. Next, we show that
these predictions are veriﬁed in this experiment.

In the present experiment (Fig. 2), we used the FM
NMOR technique [16] with 87Rb atoms. The central laser
frequency was tuned near various hfs components of the
D1 line. The typical light power was a few hundred µW
and the laser beam diameter was ∼3 mm. The laser fre-
quency was modulated at Ωm/(2π) from 50 Hz to 1 kHz,
and the frequency modulation amplitude was approxi-
mately 40 MHz (peak-to-peak). The vapor cell, with iso-
topically enriched 87Rb, is 10 cm in diameter and has an

Laser modulation frequency is 200 Hz, modulation amplitude

line. Plots (a,b) show the in-phase component of the signal
at two diﬀerent light powers; plot (c) shows the quadrature

antirelaxation coating and no buﬀer gas. The cell is sur-
rounded with four layers of magnetic shielding. A system
of coils inside the innermost shield is used to compensate
the residual ﬁelds (at a level <
∼ 0.1 µG) and ﬁrst-order
gradients, and to apply a well-controlled, arbitrarily di-
rected magnetic ﬁeld to the atoms. This allows observa-
tion of FM NMOR resonances with magnetic-ﬁeld widths
of about 1 µG in the low-light-intensity limit.

Figure 3 shows the magnetic-ﬁeld dependence of the
observed FM NMOR signals. The central
laser fre-
quency was tuned to the low-frequency slope of the
F = 2 → F ′ = 1 absorption line as shown in Fig. 4.
At relatively low light power [Fig. 3(a)], there are three
prominent resonances: one at B = 0, and two corre-
sponding to 2ΩL = Ωm. Much smaller signals, whose
relative amplitudes rapidly grow with light power, are
seen at 4ΩL = Ωm, the expected positions of the hexade-
capole resonances.

The spectral dependences for both types of resonance

NMOR signals in (a) and (b), and in particular, the absence

signals with ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld and modulation fre-
quency are shown in Fig. 4. While the quadrupole res-
onance signals [Ωm = 2ΩL; Fig. 4(a)] are observed for
both ground-state hyperﬁne components, no signals are
observed for the hexadecapole resonances [Ωm = 4ΩL;
Fig. 4(b)] near the lines involving the F = 1 ground
state, which can not support a hexadecapole moment
[26]. The diﬀerent shapes of the quadrupole and hexade-
capole spectra near the F = 2 transition group require
further analysis.

Light-intensity dependences of the resonance ampli-
tudes are shown in Fig. 5. The observed low-intensity
(I) asymptotics of these curves (which show saturation
at higher intensities) scale approximately as I 2 and I 4.
These power dependences and many other salient fea-
tures of the observed resonances can be understood with
the help of a simple model of an F = 2 → F ′ = 1 tran-
sition with independent pumping, evolution in a mag-
netic ﬁeld, and probing, in which to lowest-order, the
quadrupole and hexadecapole moments are ﬁrst (ρ(2) ∝
Ipump) and second order (ρ(4) ∝ I 2
pump) in light intensity,
respectively. The component of the signal due to the in-
duced optical rotation in the probe beam proportional to
the quadrupole moment goes as Iprobeρ(2), while that pro-
portional to the hexadecapole moment goes as I 2
probeρ(4).
The intensity dependences predicted by this model, as

circles: the quadrupole resonance; open circles: the hexade-
capole resonance. The inset shows the expanded low-power
region for the latter. From these data, we determine the ini-
tial linear slope on these log-log plots (corresponding to the
exponent in the power dependence of the signal) as 1.96(6)
and 3.75(37) for the quadrupole and hexadecapole cases, re-
spectively. The corresponding expected exponents are 2 and
4.

well as the periodicity of the signals with respect to Lar-
mor precession and the relative widths of the resonances,
match the observations from the experiment, in which a
single beam serves as pump and probe.

Figure 6 shows the dependence of the resonance widths
on power at a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld. While both the
quadrupole and hexadecapole resonances exhibit power
broadening, it is much less pronounced in the latter case.
This is important for applications such as magnetometry
because it allows operation at higher light powers with
better statistical sensitivity [21]. In the zero-power limit,
we ﬁnd that the resonance widths (Fig. 6) for the two
types of resonances tend to values near 1 µG with ratio
∆Bq/∆Bh = 0.94(4). The expected ratio of these widths
is twice the ratio of the light-independent relaxation rates
for the PM with κ = 2 and 4 [27]. Thus, we ﬁnd that the
light-independent relaxation rate for the hexadecapole is
approximately twice that of the quadrupole. Relaxation
of the PM in our experimental conditions is dominated by
the residual relaxation on the paraﬃn-coated cell walls
and spin-exchange collisions between Rb atoms. The
electron-randomization collision model (see, for example,
[22]), predicts that the quadrupole moment relaxes at a
rate 3/8 that of the hexadecapole moment, which relaxes
at the electron-randomization rate. Thus, the observed
ratio of the widths is close to the expected.

In conclusion, we have developed and applied a new
technique for the study of high atomic-polarization mo-

ments, allowing their selective creation and detection via
corresponding well-resolved resonances. The study of the
highest-rank PM signals in FM NMOR is important for
the applications of this technique in Earth-ﬁeld magne-
tometry [16]. This is because energy separation for Zee-
man sublevels with ∆M = 2F of the F = I + 1/2 states
of the alkali atoms is linear in the magnetic ﬁeld, while
separations between other sublevels are generally nonlin-
ear due to magnetic-ﬁeld mixing of states of diﬀerent F .
Therefore, it is advantageous to use of the FM NMOR
resonances due to the ∆M = 2F coherence, as will be
discussed in detail elsewhere.

Future work will explore the extension of the technique
to separated pump and probe light beams and applica-
tion to higher angular-momentum states. This will al-
low further optimization of the selective control of mul-
tipole moments and will elucidate the exact mechanisms
responsible for the nonlinear light-atom interactions in-
volved at the pump and the probe stages. Speciﬁcally,
we will explore the role of conversion of the high-rank
moments into alignment and orientation under the com-
bined action of the magnetic ﬁeld and the light shifts,
which can be of crucial importance in nonlinear optical
rotation [7, 20, 23, 24].

obtained by subtracting the average of spectra of the
quadrature component taken approximately 15 µG above
and below the resonance from the spectrum recorded
with magnetic ﬁeld set at the resonance value. This pro-
cedure renders a measurement free from the small resid-
ual contribution from the zero-ﬁeld resonance arising
from the “transit” eﬀect [16].

[27] It can be shown that the width of an FM NMOR reso-
nance corresponding to a PM of rank κ goes as γκ/(κgµ),
where γκ is the rate of light-independent relaxation for a
PM of rank κ, g is the gyromagnetic ratio, and µ is the
Bohr magneton.

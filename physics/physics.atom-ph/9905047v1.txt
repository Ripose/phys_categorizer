We propose a set of experiments in which Ramsey-fringe techniques are tailored to probe transi-
tions originating and terminating on the same ground state level. When pulses of resonant radiation,
separated by a time delay T, interact with atoms, it is possible to produce Ramsey fringes having
widths of order 1/T .
If each pulse contains two counterpropagating travelling wave modes, the
atomic wave function is split into two or more components having diﬀerent center-of-mass mo-
menta. Matter-wave interference of these components leads to atomic gratings, which have been
observed in both spatially separated ﬁelds and time separated ﬁelds. Time-dependent signals can
be transformed into frequency dependent signals, leading to ground state Ramsey fringes (GSRF).
The signals can be used to probe many problems of fundamental importance:

- If a gravitational ﬁeld is present, the atomic gratings acquire an additional phase shift. For
ground based experiments the shift can be used to obtain a precise measurement of the gravitational
acceleration g. For experiments in a microgravity environment, GSRF can be used to measure
residual gravitational ﬁelds that can be as small as 6 10

−9g.

- When atoms move in a rotating frame, the atomic grating acquires an additional phase caused
by Coriolis acceleration, which also leads to a shift of the GSRF line-center. We propose to use GSRF
as the basis for a new type of gyroscope. Very preliminary estimates show that in a microgravity
environment one can measure a rotation rate with an accuracy of 6 10−3◦/h, which is 10 times better
than that achieved using a ﬁber optic gyroscope.

- Since atomic scattering from the pulses is accompanied by a momentum change, i. e. by recoil, a
modulation of the grating dependence with time delay T occurs. This modulation, whose frequency
is equal to the atomic recoil frequency, leads to recoil splitting of the GSRF signal. The recoil
−6 and used for recoil frequency measurements,
splitting can be resolved with relative accuracy 10
important for a precise determination of Planck’s constant.

Since only transitions originating and terminating on the same ground state are involved, fre-
quency measurements can be carried out using lasers phase-locked by quartz oscillators having
relatively low frequency. Our technique may allow one to increase the precision by a factor of 100
(the rf- to quartz oscillator frequencies ratio) over previous experiments based on Raman-Ramsey
fringes or reduce on the same factor requirements for frequency stabilization.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent progress in cooling and trapping of neutral
atoms allows one to observe extremely slow processes in-
volving atoms in their ground states. These processes
can serve as the basis for a new generation of atomic
clocks whose operation is based entirely or partially on
matter-wave interferometry.

For atoms having a velocity spread of order 1 cm/s
that are conﬁned to an interaction volume of 1 cm3, one
can observe the evolution of various ground-state coher-
ences for times Te of order 1 s. The line widths associated
with these coherences can be as small as 0.15 Hz, allowing
for frequency measurements having an accuracy of order
0.01 − 1 mHz. Very often, the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld
is the limiting factor that determines the accuracy one
can achieve in these measurements. The most important
eﬀect of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld is to introduce a
Doppler frequency shift in matter-radiation ﬁeld interac-
tions. These shifts can be signiﬁcant in high precision
measurements of atomic recoil or rotational sensing. For

experiments carried out on the time scale of 1 s, atoms are
accelerated in the Earth’s ﬁeld to a velocity of 103 cm/s,
which leads to a Doppler shift on the order of 10 MHz.
This large Doppler shift can often obscure the small recoil
or rotational shifts one is attempting to measure in high
precision experiments. As a result, it would be useful and
important to use a microgravity environment to carry out
high precision measurements of fundamental constants
and inertial eﬀects, where such measurements could be
carried out with unprecedented precision. In addition to
the advantages gained by elimination of the gravitational
Doppler shift, one also ﬁnds that the atom-ﬁeld interac-
tion time can be increased since atoms do not fall out of
the atom-radiation ﬁeld interaction region as a result of
gravitational acceleration.

In this article we discuss a new technique for preci-
sion measurements based entirely on matter wave inter-
ference [1], where one produces coherences between dif-
ferent atomic center-of-mass states within the same inter-
nal state. For the current state of atom interferometry,
see [2]. The exclusion of any internal transitions allows

1

one either to increase the measurement accuracy, or, for a
ﬁxed accuracy, to reduce the requirements for frequency
stabilization.

The article is arranged as follows.

In the next sec-
tion we compare brieﬂy diﬀerent techniques to estimate
the advantages of the matter wave interference method.
In sections III and IV we present our previous results
for gravitational acceleration and recoil frequency mea-
surements. The ground state Ramsey fringe technique
(GSRF) is discussed in Sec. V. In Sec. VI we estimate
the residual gravity measurement in the microgravity en-
vironment. Sec. VII is devoted to an atom gyroscope in a
microgravity environment and in a ground-based experi-
ment. One possibility for increasing experimental preci-
sion by producing higher order atom gratings is discussed
in Sec. VIII. An observation of these gratings using a 3-
pulse echo technique is presented in Sec. IX. The results
are summarized in Sec. X.

II. COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT
TECHNIQUES

Even in a microgravity environment the time of evo-
lution Te is still restricted by the instability of the laser
frequency that produces this coherence. If the coherence
oscillates at a frequency ωe with stability α, then evi-
dently the limitation on Te is given by

Te <

∼ (αωe)

−1

.

(1)

Typically, the Ramsey technique [3] is used for precise
measurements, where one applies two or more resonant
pulses separated by a time delay T ∼ Te. If a resonant
optical ﬁeld having frequency Ω and wave vector k (see
ﬁg. 1a) excites an atom from the initial state |i, pi to
the ﬁnal state |f, p+¯hki , where p and p+¯hk are the ini-
tial and ﬁnal atomic center-of-mass momenta, and i and
f label internal degrees of freedom, the atom coherence
evolves in free space at a frequency

ωatom =

εf,p+¯hk − εi,p
¯h

= ωf i + k · v+ωk,

(2)

where the state energy εf,p consists of the internal en-
ergy εf and kinetic energy p2/2m, m is an atom mass,
ωf i is a transition frequency, v = p/m is an atomic ve-
locity, ωk = ¯hk2/2m is a recoil frequency. For a time T
between successive pulses, the atom coherence and ﬁeld
acquire diﬀerent phases, ωatomT and ΩT , respectively.
For the single-photon Ramsey fringe technique sensitive
to this phase diﬀerence, this leads to an atom- ﬁeld de-
phasing φ that consists of three parts, [4]

φ = φR − φD − φq,

φR = ∆T,
φD = k · vT,
φq = ωkT,

(3a)
(3b)
(3c)
(3d)

where ∆ = Ω − ωf i is the atom-ﬁeld detuning. These
three parts play qualitatively diﬀerent roles.

The Ramsey phase φR leads to Ramsey fringes which
one uses for frequency stabilization to create precise
atomic clocks. For a given measure of the frequency sta-
bility α, the limit for the time evolution of the coherence
is given by

Te <

(4)

In the rf domain the Doppler phase, φD ≪ 1, can be
neglected. On the other hand, in the optical domain,
φD > 1 and, on averaging over the velocity distribution,
the Ramsey fringe signal is destroyed [7]. The washing
out of the signal is analogous to that which occurs in
free induction decay (FID). The signal can be restored
by the use of echo techniques involving multiple pulses of
standing-wave ﬁelds [8] and/or counterpropagating op-
tical ﬁelds. (If one uses copropagating traveling waves,
the Ramsey phase and the Doppler phase both go to zero
at the time the echo signal is generated.) Optical Ram-
sey fringes using three spatially separated standing waves
were observed ﬁrst in Ne on the transition at λ = 0.5882
µ [9].

In contrast to the washing out of the macroscopic atom
coherence, the Doppler phase can play a positive role in
the optical domain. When the atom velocity changes ow-
ing to external forces, a total cancellation of the Doppler
phase does not occur. If the atom acceleration is inde-
pendent of the projection of the velocity along the wave
propagation direction, the residual Doppler dephasing
does not wash out the Ramsey fringes, but it can lead to
a shift or deformation of the Ramsey fringe line shape.
Therefore, optical Ramsey fringes can serve as a sensor
of atomic acceleration [10]. They were used ﬁrst for this
purpose in Ca on the transition at λ = 0.6527 µm [11] to
measure a rotation frequency.

Owing to multiphoton processes in an atom’s interac-
tion with a standing wave ﬁeld, quantum dephasing (3d)
is responsible for the recoil splitting of optical Ramsey
fringes [12] into components centered at

∆ ∼ ±ωk,

ﬁrst observed also on the transition in Ca [13].

It has proven advantageous to substitute a two-photon
Raman transition between diﬀerent atomic ground state
hyperﬁne sublevels [14] for the one-photon optical tran-
sitions (see ﬁg. 1b). Consider the interaction of an atom
with two optical waves having frequencies Ω1 and Ω2,
both nearly resonant with the coupled atomic transitions
i → c and c → f, respectively, where i and f are the ini-
tial and ﬁnal hyperﬁne sublevels of the atomic ground
state. When the detunings, ∆1 and ∆2, are larger than
the inverse pulse duration, it is possible to drive a two-
quantum transition between states i and f which is res-
onant when

δ = Ω2 − Ω1 + νrf

is equal to 0. When an atom interacts with separated
pulses, where each pulse consists of a pair of ﬁelds hav-
ing frequencies Ω1 and Ω2, the Ramsey phase becomes

If k1 and k2 are wave vectors of the ﬁelds, absorption
from mode (Ω1, k2) and stimulated emission into mode
(Ω2, k2) , leads to a momentum change for the atoms
given by p → p + ¯hq, where

φR = δT.

q = k1−k2.

The atomic coherence i → f oscillates now at the fre-

quency

ωatom =

εf,p+¯hq − εi,p

.

(2), one concludes that
From a comparison with Eq.
for a qualitative consideration of Ramsey fringes on two-
quantum transitions, one can simply substitute

k → q = k1 − k2.

in Eqs. (3c, 3d) to obtain Doppler and quantum dephas-
ings,

φD = q · vT,
φq = ωqT,

(11a)
(11b)

respectively.

The eﬀective wave vector q changes from 0 for coprop-
agating waves to 2k for counterpropagating waves. Con-
sequently, dephasing can be equal to or greater than the
dephasing for optical Ramsey fringes. Shifts of the line
center caused by quantum, inertial, or gravitational ef-
fects are also of the same order of magnitude. However,
the shifts are now measured relative to the rf transition
frequency, νrf . Even though the line width of each laser
oscillating at the frequencies Ω1 and Ω2 could be of or-
der of 1 MHz, modern stabilization techniques allow [15]
one to control the frequency diﬀerence, Ω1 − Ω2, with a
precision ανrf , and, therefore, the evolution time of the
coherence is restricted by

Compared with the evolution time (4) allowed by the
optical transition, the time (12) can be up to a factor

(13)

larger, which allows one to increase tremendously the ac-
curacy of precision measurements.

The Raman-Ramsey technique was used [16] to mea-
sure the recoil frequency ωq in Cs (transition νrf ≈
9.2 GHz) with an accuracy 1.1×10−7. This measurement
is important for a precise determination of the ﬁne struc-
ture constant [16]. A sensitivity to gravitational acceler-
ation at the level 3 × 10−8g has been observed [17] using
the Raman-Ramsey resonance in sodium atoms (transi-
tion νrf ≈ 1.7 GHz). An atom gyroscope operating on
the transition in Cs has been created [18] as well, which
can have a long term stability of 10−5 ◦/h for rotation
measurements [19].

In the progression from ”one-photon optical Ramsey
fringes” to ”two-quantum Raman-Ramsey fringes”, we
propose the next natural step for experiments with ﬁelds
separated in time or space. Only optical transitions i → c
and c → f are responsible for the Doppler and recoil ef-
fects, while the transition i → f is not relevant to these
eﬀects. On the other hand the i → f transition fre-

be decreased out of the microwave range since atom hy-
perﬁne transition frequencies belong to this region. The
restriction can only be relaxed [20] if both the ﬁnal and
initial internal states coincide (see ﬁg. 2). In this case
only a transition between diﬀerent center-of-mass states,
p and p + n¯hq, occurs. According to a classiﬁcation of
atom interferometers, [21] this scheme belongs the class,
matter wave atom interferometers (MWAI).

FIG. 2. Matter wave interference scheme.

There is no inherent reason why MWAI would produce
worse measurement errors than the Raman-Ramsey tech-
nique, but owing to the absence of any internal transi-
tions, the MWAI has the potential to provide more pre-
cise measurements. Indeed, the interference between ini-
tial and ﬁnal states

where we assume for f a typical value (10 − 100 M Hz) .
Even if for other reasons, such as a wave front curvature
or magnetic ﬁeld gradient, a further increase of the evo-
lution time becomes impossible, our scheme still has an
advantage. For a given Te using MWAI, one has to have
the frequency stability

Ψin ∝ exp (ip · r/¯h) and Ψout ∝ exp [i (p+¯hq) · r/¯h]

(14)

(15)

leads to a grating in the atomic ground state population

ρgg (r) ∝ cos (q · r) .

We propose to use this grating as a sensor of the grav-
ity, inertial, and quantum eﬀects, instead of the coher-
ence i → f in the Raman-Ramsey scheme. The quantum
dephasing (11b) aﬀects only the population grating am-
plitude [1]. The velocity-dependent part of the Doppler
phase (11a) is canceled at an echo time, and by avoid-
ing internal transitions, we exclude any restrictions on
increasing the grating evolution time Te that might arise
from the physics of the atom-ﬁeld interaction.

The restriction on Te is rather technical. A small
detuning δ (of order of several mHz) deﬁnitely resides
within the noise bandwidth of the ﬁelds (Ω1, k1) and
(Ω2, k2). Therefore, these ﬁelds cannot be detuned by
δ directly. To detune them, one can use highly stabilized
quartz oscillators 1 and 2 operating on the frequencies f
and f + δ, respectively, where f is a typical quartz os-
cillator frequency. The only requirement in choosing f
is that it be larger than the lasers’ noise bandwidth. A
sequence of detunings of lasers 1, 2 and 3, as shown in
ﬁg. 3, controlled by quartz oscillators 1 and 2, solves the
problem.

III. EARTH GRAVITY MEASUREMENT

In the remaining parts of the article, we describe our
current results and estimate the measurement accuracy
one can achieve in ground based experiments and in mi-
crogravity measurements. We observed MWAI using a
time-domain interferometer [22]. Two oﬀ-resonant stand-
ing wave pulses separated by a time T are applied to a
sample of cold (150 µK) 85Rb atoms. The ﬁrst laser
pulse imposes a spatial phase modulation on the initial
atomic state, which, due to the dispersion of de Broglie
waves in free space, evolves into an amplitude modula-
tion (representing an atomic population grating). Owing
to the Doppler dephasing, this grating decays in a time
of 1µs. Applying a second pulse, one restores gratings at
the echo points,

Te = (N + 1)T,

(19)

where N is an integer.

In our experiments, 85Rb atoms are ﬁrst cooled from
a room-temperature vapor in a magneto-optical trap
(MOT). Approximately 12 msec after the trapping laser
beams and magnetic ﬁeld are turned oﬀ (in order to al-
low eddy currents to die out), the two oﬀ-resonant (be-
tween 30 and 100 MHz detuning) standing wave pulses
(∼ 100 ns duration) are applied. The standing wave
pulses are composed of two traveling waves (in direc-
tions k1 and k2), switched on and oﬀ independently by
a pair of acousto-optic modulators (AOM). The AOMs
are driven by a common radio frequency (rf) oscillator
operating at 220 MHz (see Fig. 4). The atomic grating
is probed by switching on only the traveling wave along
k2 and measuring the (complex) amplitude of the wave
scattered into the direction k1.

The scattered wave is detected by beating it with an
optical local-oscillator in a balanced heterodyne arrange-
ment. The local oscillator is derived from the light pass-
ing undiﬀracted through the AOM used to switch the
k1 beam. During the experiment, the echo beat signal
is further mixed down by a 220 MHz reference from the
rf oscillator using a quadrature demodulator. The two
outputs of this demodulator represent the real and imag-
inary parts of the scattered light ﬁeld, where the real
part is in phase with the k1 ﬁeld (which is not on during
detection), and the imaginary part is π/2 out of phase

5

with k1.

Typical time-dependences of the scattered signal am-
plitudes in the vicinity of the echo points Te = 2T
(N = 1) and Te = 3T (N = 2) are shown in Fig. 5.

Since our detection scheme is sensitive to the phase of
the scattered signal, it is possible to measure the inﬂu-
ence of the gravitational acceleration g. The acceleration
changes an atom trajectory and the Doppler phase (11a).
The time dependence of the atom grating Doppler phase
is shown in the Fig. 6.

FIG. 6. Echo phase diagram for free space (dashed line)

and in the presence of gravity (solid line).

We show here the process responsible for the echo
at Te = 2T. The ﬁrst pulse produces an atom grat-
ing evolving as exp [−iq · r (0)] , where r (0) is the atom
position at t = 0. A nonlinear 4-quantum interaction
with second pulse results in the atom grating evolving
as exp [−iq · r (0) + 2iq · r (T )] . For a given space time
point (r, t) this dependence can be represented as

ρgg (r) ∝ exp (iq · r+iφD) ,

(20)

where the Doppler phase φD consists of two parts

φD (t) = φ1 + φ2,

φ1 = q · δr1,
φ2 = −q · δr2,

(21a)
(21b)
(21c)

δr1 and δr2 are the atomic displacements between 0
and T and between T and t. Without gravity δr1 =
vT, δr2 = v(t − T ) and the phases φ1,2 cancel one an-
other at the echo point. In a gravitational ﬁeld,

δr1 = vT + gT 2/2
2
δr2 = v (T ) (t − T ) + g (t − T )

/2,

(22a)

(22b)

where v is the initial velocity, v (T ) = v + gT . Cancella-
tion of the Doppler phase dependence on v still occurs at
t = 2T, but a residual gravity dependent part φg arises
which is equal to

φg ≡ φD (2T ) = q · gT 2.

(23)

We observe this dependence. Fig. 7 shows our re-
sults for the ﬁrst echo (Te = 2T ) in the case where
k1 = −k2 and are aligned to within 1 mrad of vertical,
so the expected phase dependence on the pulse spacing
is φD (2T ) = 2kg T 2. Fig. 7(a) shows the phase as a
function of pulse spacing (points) together with a solid
curve corresponding to the best ﬁt, which was obtained

for g = 9.798 m/s2. Fig. 7(b) shows the diﬀerence be-
tween this best ﬁt and the data.

IV. RECOIL FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT.

The inﬂuence of atom acceleration arises whether or
not the particles’ motion needs to be quantized. In con-
trast, eﬀects related to recoil are necessarily linked with
quantization of the atomic center-of-mass motion [23].
The quantum part of dephasing (11b) arises as a result
of quantization. This part leads to the periodic depen-
dence of the echo amplitude on the time delay between
pulses. The period is given by

∆T = π/ωq.

(24)

Observation of the periodical dependence allows one to
measure precisely the recoil frequency

ωq = ¯hq2/2m,

(25)

which is important for precise determination of the fun-
damental constants [16]. The best accuracy of this mea-
surement can be achieved in a microgravity environment.

We observed [22] oscillation of the atom grating am-
plitudes. Examples of the oscillating dependences are
shown in Fig. 8.

The precision ∆ωq with which one can determine the
recoil frequency is given approximately by ∆ωq/ωq =
∆T /Tmax, where ∆T is the uncertainty in the time of
the zeroes of the signal and Tmax is the maximum value
of T that yields a signiﬁcant signal. For our data we esti-
mate ∆ωq/ωq = (100 ns)/(1 ms) = 10−4. We calculated
the period by measuring the time between well-displaced
zeroes of the signal and dividing by the number of inter-
vening periods. This yielded a period of 32.388 µs [com-
pare this with the result of 32.386 µs calculated from Eq.
(24) for transition λ = 0.78µ in 85Rb].

V. GROUND STATE RAMSEY FRINGES

The experiments described above have been carried out
in the time domain. One can expect that the accuracy of
measurement will be higher in the frequency domain. For
this purpose we propose the ground state Ramsey fringes
(GSRF) technique [20]. If traveling wave modes k1 and
k2 are slightly detuned from each other by the detuning
δ, as shown in Fig. 2, the atom coherence (ground state
population grating) acquires the Ramsey phase

φR ∼ δT.

(26)

For a given time delay between pulses, one can monitor
the signal from a back-scattered ﬁeld as a function of δ.
The presence of atomic acceleration or recoil aﬀects the
positions of the GSRF maxima. One obtains another
type of the acceleration or recoil eﬀect sensor which, in
contrast to the Raman-Ramsey fringes, has the potential
to increase the time of the measurement beyond the limit
imposed by the large frequency of the involved internal
transitions.

The scheme of the GSRF is shown in ﬁg. 9. The
ﬁrst pulse produces a grating which acquires the Ramsey
phase (26), but it decays fast owing to the large Doppler

phase (11a). For the second pulse, we propose to reverse
the directions of the travelling waves with respect to the
ﬁrst pulse. If the second pulse were identical to the ﬁrst,
then the Ramsey and Doppler phases would be mutually
constrained: they enter into the grating phase only in
the combination φR − φD and, therefore, a cancellation
of the Doppler phase coincides with a loss of the Ramsey
phase. But, if one reverses the directions of the travelling
waves, then non-linear processes become possible where
the Doppler phases acquired during the time intervals,
[0, T ] and [T, 2T ], are canceled while the Ramsey phases
acquired during these intervals add to one another.

Finally, the third, readout pulse, consisting of only one
traveling mode {k1, Ω} , scatters oﬀ the atom grating into
the ﬁeld mode {k2, Ω + δ} radiated by the vapor. This
signal contains the Ramsey fringes, i. e. the oscillating
dependence on the Ramsey phase (26).

VI. RESIDUAL GRAVITY MEASUREMENT IN A
MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT

The extreme sensitivity of the GSRF signal to small
perturbations of the atomic center-of-mass motion makes
it ideal for acceleration measurements in a micrograv-
ity environment. A program for carrying out such mea-
surements [the Space Acceleration Measurement System

7

(SAMS)] is part of the NASA program [28]. The sensors
of residual gravity are necessary to control the environ-
mental quality. We propose to investigate the potential
for GSRF measurements of residual gravity in a micro-
gravity environment.

For further estimates of the measurement accuracy, we
need a minimum measurable value of the GSRF shift δ.
There is no reason for this shift to be worse than that
achieved by the Raman-Ramsey technique, but, as we
have explained above, for GSRF this shift can be smaller.
The ultimate limit for GSRF shift will be established by
experiments, either ground based or gravity free. In this
article we take the lower boundary of the shift equal to

δmin = 2π 15 mHz.

(27)

One can get this value as a product of the rela-
tive accuracy (cid:0)1.1 10−7(cid:1) of the recoil frequency mea-
surement using the Raman-Ramsey technique [15] and
ωq (2π 130 kHz) . The halfwidth of the Raman-Ramsey
fringes in the experiment of Ref. [15] was

ΓR ≈ 2π 8 Hz.

(28)

Let us estimate the minimum residual acceleration
gr min which can be measured by GSRF in a cold 85Rb
vapor or beam.
If GSRF in time separated ﬁelds are
used, the gravitational phase shift φgr in the vicinity of
the t = 2T echo point is obtained by replacing g → gr
(23), φgr = q · grT 2. When the phase shift is
in Eq.
small, it results in a shift of the GSRF by an amount
δgr ∼ φgr /T = q · grT. Since we assume that a frequency
measurement with accuracy (27) is possible, for q k gr
and T = 100 ms one gets for a lower limit of the residual
gravity measurement

gr min ≈ 6 10

−9g.

(29)

To measure such a small residual gravity, one has to
exclude corrections arising from rotations. Rotation with
frequency Ωr leads to a Coriolis acceleration of order of
2 hui Ωr, where hui is the mean atomic velocity.
In an
atomic beam launched with velocity u = 17 cm/s, the re-
quirement that the Coriolis acceleration produce a shift
less than the minimum residual gravitational shift given
by Eq. (29) can be stated as

Ωr < 3 10

−3Ωearth.

(30)

The situation improves if one uses a cold atomic vapor,
such as that used in our experiment [22] and in experi-
ments on optical transitions in Mg [29]. The corrections
from rotation would vanish identically if the mean veloc-
ity of the vapor were identically equal to zero. If there is
some asymmetry in the distribution that gives rise to a
mean velocity hui = α∆u, where ∆u is the width of the
velocity distribution, then it is necessary that

α < gr min/2∆uΩr.

(31)

for rotational eﬀects to be negligible. Even if the space
station rotates with the earth’s rotation rate, for the
transition in 85Rb and ∆u = 17 cm/s, one ﬁnds that
α < 3 10−3 is needed. This less severe restriction shows
that it is better to use cold vapors than beams for precise
measurements of residual gravity.

VII. ATOM GYROSCOPE

In this section we estimate the precision of an atomic
gyroscope based on GSRF. Estimates have to be per-
formed separately for the microgravity environment and
ground-based experiment.

A. Atom gyroscope in a microgravity environment.

We propose to use GSRF as a sensor of a system’s ro-
tation. When Ramsey fringes are observed in a frame
rotating with angular frequency Ωr, the atoms undergo
a Coriolis acceleration equal to

a =2v × Ωr.

(32)

Owing to this acceleration, a new type of dephasing φr
arises [10]. To obtain this dephasing for a small rotation
rate, one can neglect changes of the acceleration result-
In this limit,
ing from changes in the atomic velocity.
one can simply replace g by a in Eq. (23) to obtain the
rotational dephasing φr given by

φr = 2 (q × Ωr) · vT 2.

(33)

A direct observation of this fringe shift has been reported
previously using microfabricated structures to scatter
atoms [24,25]. A precision of

where Ωearth = 15◦/h is the earth rotation rate, has been
achieved [25]. We have already discussed rotational ob-
servations using optical Ramsey fringes [11] and Raman-
Ramsey fringes [18,19]. In the latter case the precision
is

δΩr = 6 10

−3Ωearth = 0.08

◦

/h.

(35)

This precision is still below that of ﬁber-optic-gyroscopes
[26] (0.047 ◦/h), but already better than that of ring-laser
gyroscopes [27] (0.18 ◦/h).

One can use the Ramsey resonance shift as a rota-
tion sensor [10,11]. In contrast to measurements of pho-
ton recoil eﬀects or gravitational acceleration which can
be measured using either temporally or spatially sep-
arated pulses, gyroscopic measurements involving fre-
quency measurements should be carried out using spa-
tially separated ﬁelds [10]. A scheme for accomplishing
this using GSRF is shown in Fig. 10.

FIG. 10. Gyroscope based on ground state Ramsey fringes.

If the rotation frequency is perpendicular to q, the ro-
tation phase (33) is equal to φr = 2qΩrsign (u) L2/u,
where L = uT is the spatial separation of the ﬁelds. The
Ramsey phase φR = 2δT = 2δL/u has the same depen-
dence on longitudinal velocity u as φr. The total phase
is

φ = φR + φr = 2 (δ + qLΩr) /u.

(36)

The Ramsey fringes are centered at the point where
φ = 0. As a result of the rotation, the central fringe
is shifted by

δ = −sign (u) qLΩr.

(37)

The highest gyroscope accuracy can be reached in a
microgravity environment. If an eﬀusive beam of atoms
with thermal velocity u crosses three interaction zones,
each separated from one another by distance L, than the
Ramsey fringes halfwidth is given by [6]

ΓR ≈ 0.6u/L.

(38)

The distance between ﬁelds L can be chosen arbitrar-
ily. A large distance allows for a more precise mea-
surement of the rotation frequency. We set L =
20 cm in arriving at our estimates. For the fringe
halfwidth (28) and u ≈ 20 m/s on a transition in 85Rb
(cid:0)λ = 0.78µ, q = 1.6 105 cm−1(cid:1) with the shift given by Eq.
(27), the minimum measurable rotation rate is equal to

B. GSRF gyroscope in ground based measurements

In principle, the same accuracy (39) can be achieved
in ground based experiments, but for this purpose the
wave vectors ki have to be aligned in the horizontal
plane to exclude gravitational inﬂuence. Let us esti-
mate the requirements for this alignment. The typi-
cal time of ﬂight of atoms between separated ﬁelds is
T ∼ L/u ∼ 1.5/ΓR ≈ 30 ms. If θ is the order of magni-
tude of the small residual angle between the wave vectors
and the horizontal plane, then the gravitational phase
(23), φg ∼ qgθT 2, leads to the GSRF shift qgθT . When
we require this to be smaller than the minimum measur-
able shift (27), one ﬁnds that for a transition in 85Rb,

phases of the ﬁrst and second order grating [evolving as
cos (q · r) and cos (2q · r), respectively] are compared.

I,II and δr

For the further elimination of gravity in ground based
measurements, one can observe simultaneously two scat-
tered signals, I and II (see Fig. 11). These signals both
contain GSRF’s, whose shifts δI,II consist of gravita-
tional and rotational parts δg
I,II. From Fig.
11, one concludes that signal II is produced by the ﬁelds
consisting of traveling wave ﬁeld modes (∓k2, Ω + δ) and
(∓k1,Ω) instead of modes (±k1,Ω) and (±k2, Ω + δ) re-
sponsible for signal I (signal II is obtained from signal
I by the substitutions k1↔ −k2, Ω ↔ Ω + δ). Under
this transformation the wave vector diﬀerence q given
by Eq. (10) is not changed, but the detuning δ changes
sign. Thus, the gravity-induced parts of the shifts have
II ) = −sign (δg
opposite sign, sign (δg
I ) , and the sum of
the shifts δ = δI + δII is gravity insensitive provided that
the ﬁelds are imposed symmetrically with respect to the
symmetry axis of the atomic spatial-velocity distribution
(dashed arrow on the Fig. 11). A similar idea for elimi-
nating the eﬀects of gravity in rotation measurements has
been considered recently [31] and realized in the Raman-
Ramsey gyroscope [19].

FIG. 11. A scheme of the atomic gyroscope in the presence

of the earth’s gravity ﬁeld.

This severe requirement for the atomic phase space dis-
tribution to have a symmetry axis is easier to realize for
atoms in a cell in thermal equilibrium than in counter-
propagating atomic beams.

VIII. HIGHER ORDER ATOMIC GRATINGS.

To increase the sensitivity to an atom’s acceleration,
one can use higher order atom gratings having wave
numbers that are a multiple of q. The nonlinear inter-
action of an atom with a pulse of non-copropagating
ﬁelds applied to the same transition leads to higher order
grating production in the atom ground state population
[1,5,6,8,9,13,20–22]. This is in contrast to the interaction
with separated traveling waves [10,11,29] or counterprop-
agating traveling waves applied on adjacent transitions
[14–19,31], where to get higher harmonics one needs a
number of pulses [15]. (The only exception is a multi-
ple beam atom interferometer [32].) When higher har-
monics are involved in the process of grating formation,
one can expect that the part of the Doppler phase (23)
caused by acceleration a increases. This should allow
one to increase the accuracy of the acceleration measure-
ment. This statement is illustrated in Fig. 12, where the

ﬁrst-order grating localized near the echo point Te = 2T and
(b) second order grating localized near Te = 3/2T for free
space (dashed line) and in the presence of gravity (solid line).

Consider the general case. If the ﬁrst strong pulse pro-
duces an atom grating evolving as ein1q·r, this grating
acquires the Doppler phase part,

φ1 = n1q · δr1,

(41)

where δr1 is the atomic displacement, during the time in-
terval [0, T ] . Similarly, if after the second pulse the grat-
ing einq·r is produced, it acquires an additional phase
during the time interval [T, t],

φ2 = nq · δr2,

(42)

where δr2 is the corresponding atomic displacement. Us-
ing expressions (22) one ﬁnds that the total phase φD(t)
is given by

φD(t) = q · v [n1T + n (t − T )] +

1/2q · a (cid:2)n1T 2 + n (cid:0)t2 − T 2

(cid:1)(cid:3) .

(43)

The echo point is by deﬁnition, a time, t = Te, where the
velocity dependent part is canceled. One ﬁnd that this
cancellation occurs at all points

T,

Te =

n′
n
where n′ = n − n1 (|n′| > |n|) , integers n′ and n have no
common factor. Since after the second pulse the grating
evolves as einq·r, the grating period is given by 2π/nq.
One sees that the ﬁrst harmonic (n = 1) is localized at
the points 2T, 3T, . . ., the second harmonic (n = 2) is
localized at 3/2T, 5/2T, . . . and so on.

(44)

At the echo point the residual Doppler phase φa ≡
φD(Te) associated with acceleration a can be represented
as

φa = 2n(1 − T /Te)φs,

(45)

9

where φs = q · aT 2
e /4 the minimum value of φa at the
point Te = 2T. The echo time Te is evidently the to-
tal time of the atomic coherence evolution. To compare
acceleration-related phases, this time has to be ﬁxed.
The ratio φa/φs for the diﬀerent grating periods and dif-
ferent time separation between pulses T is shown in the
following table

IX. THREE-PULSE ECHO TECHNIQUE.

In this section we describe our recent technique [33] for
observing the higher order atomic gratings. Higher order
gratings allow one to improve the sensitivity of inertial
measurements.

In the Sec. III we described the back-scattering tech-
nique to observe atomic grating. The grating was de-
tected by applying a traveling wave to the atomic cloud
and measuring the coherent backscattering of this trav-
eling wave. One of the properties of this detection tech-
nique is that it is sensitive only to the second harmonic of
the atomic density distribution (i.e. the spatial Fourier
component with period 2π/q). This detection technique
has the nice feature for atom interferometry experiments
that the signal is not accompanied by a (possibly large)
background due to the zeroth harmonic of the atomic
density distribution. It has a disadvantage in that it re-
veals no direct information about the higher harmonics
(4th, 6th, etc).

By applying a second standing wave at a time T2 after
the initial standing wave, one can rephase the 1st order
grating (with periodicity 2π/q) and produce high (nth)
order gratings (with periodicity 2π/nq) at various times
after the this second pulse. To observe higher order grat-
ings, we apply a third standing-wave pulse (SW3) whose
purpose is to convert the higher-order grating into a 2nd-
order grating that can be detected by the back-scattering
technique described above.

Our experiments were carried out with a cloud of 85Rb
atoms cooled down to 105 µK in a magneto-optical trap.
The cloud was illuminated by a series of three optical
pulses of two σ+-polarized plane waves traveling in op-
posite directions, k1 and k2 (see Figure 13).

The frequency of the optical pulses was detuned above
the atomic transition frequency of the 85Rb 5S1/2 (F = 3)
– 5P3/2 (F ′ = 4) transition by 400 MHz. The role of
spontaneous processes was therefore negligible. The ﬁrst
pulse (SW1) creates a spatial grating in the atomic cloud.
The grating rapidly vanishes due to the Doppler dephas-
ing. The pulse SW2 causes the reappearance of the grat-
ings of various orders at later times (see Fig. 14).

FIG. 14. Phase diagrams of three diﬀerent three-pulse

At a time in the vicinity of (3/2)T2, where the 2nd
order grating is expected to occur, we applied a third
standing wave pulse. Figures 14 (a) and (b) show the
eﬀect of the third pulse on the second order grating (pe-
riod π/q). Echoes occur at times when the lines cross
the horizontal (t) axis. If the third pulse occurs before
(3/2)T2, we call the signal the slow echo and observe the
echo shown in Fig. 14(a). On the other hand, Fig. 14(b)
shows the situation when the third pulse occurs after the
time (3/2)T2, which we call the fast echo. In addition, we
ﬁnd another echo signal that depends on all three of the
standing-wave pulses, shown in Fig. 14(c). These echoes

10

can be distinguished experimentally by measuring their
time of occurrence as a function of the time of application
of the excitation pulses. In particular, Figure 15 shows
the time of the echoes of Fig. 14 as a function of the time
of the third pulse.

that when the SW3 pulse is applied, the amplitude of
the two-pulse echo produced by SW1 and SW2 becomes
smaller. This is because a part of the phase trajectories
leading to this echo is converted by SW3.

The contrast of the higher order grating can be found
from the echo amplitude. We have studied the ampli-
tude of the fast and slow echoes as a function of T3. The
experimental data and theoretical ﬁt are shown in ﬁgure

Even though the theory ﬁts the experiment well, addi-
tional study is required to be able to monitor the higher
order gratings by looking at the echo signal.

To summarize, in our three-pulse experiment we suc-
cessfully detected the second order atomic density grating
in a MOT cloud. In addition, use of three standing wave
pulses allows us not only to detect the higher order grat-
ings, but also to convert them to yet higher orders. It is
also a ﬁrst step in our study of multi-pulse echoes. One
intention is to measure gravitational acceleration using
higher order gratings.

Around the echo time, Te, the grating is probed by

tual experimental data points representing times when
echo signals were detected. The vertical lines marked A
and B correspond to two time traces shown in ﬁgure 16.
In these traces one can clearly see three diﬀerent echoes,
the one two-pulse and two three-pulse echoes, that fall

X. CONCLUSION

Matter wave interference techniques can lead to signif-
icant improvements in the precise measurement of iner-
tial, gravitational, and quantum eﬀects.

Being insensitive to the energy of the atomic internal
motion, the shape and the center of the ground state
Ramsey fringes do not depend on perturbations of the
internal state. Simultaneously, the accuracy of measure-
ments is not related to any frequency of internal transi-
tions. It allows one to increase the time of the atomic
coherences’ evolution Te by 2-3 orders of magnitude, or
reduce requirements for frequency stabilization by 2-3 or-
ders of magnitude.

These advantages can be exploited most fully in a mi-
crogravity environment, where the experiments do not

11

suﬀer the enormous gravitational dephasing of atom co-
herences between diﬀerent center-of-mass states.

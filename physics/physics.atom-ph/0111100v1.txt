Using the eigenchannel R-matrix method we calculate partial photoionization cross sections from
the ground state of the helium atom for incident photon energies up to the N = 9 manifold. The
wide energy range covered by our calculations permits a thorough investigation of general patterns
in the cross sections which were ﬁrst discussed by Menzel and co-workers [Phys. Rev. A 54, 2080
(1996)]. The existence of these patterns can easily be understood in terms of propensity rules for
autoionization. As the photon energy is increased the regular patterns are locally interrupted by
perturber states until they fade out indicating the progressive break-down of the propensity rules
and the underlying approximate quantum numbers. We demonstrate that the destructive inﬂuence
of isolated perturbers can be compensated with an energy-dependent quantum defect.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Consisting of only three particles, two electrons and a
nucleus, the helium atom nevertheless possesses rich dy-
namics with complex features. Hence, helium has always
been a focus of research and it has incessantly been used
as a testing ground of fundamental concepts. In every
energy regime the correlated dynamics of the two elec-
trons can be probed by photon impact. This has been
the most precise method of investigation in terms of en-
ergy resolution although some limitations exist since only
those excited states can be accessed whose population is
allowed via dipole selection rules from the initial state
(usually the ground state). The domain of high double
excitation can be scrutinized in greater detail with the
advance of the experimental and theoretical tools avail-
able. A leading theme in these studies is the exploration
of regularities in the observables of this classically chaotic
three-body Coulomb system. Moreover, one would like
to know how chaotic features emerge when the double-
ionization threshold is approached by increasing the en-
ergy.

Most experiments have concentrated on total photoab-
sorption cross sections [1, 2, 3, 4]. This is also true
for those theoretical calculations which have reached the
highest excitation energy so far. The reason is simply
that the method of complex rotation allows for the most
eﬀective computation of resonances in terms of their com-
plex energies (where the real part is the energy posi-
tion and the imaginary part half the resonance width).
However, these widths are total widths and only non-
diﬀerential observables such as the total photoabsorption
cross section can be constructed without losing the eﬀec-
tivity of the approach [5, 6, 7, 8].

Yet, as has been demonstrated recently, interesting ad-
ditional features such as radiative and relativistic eﬀects
emerge by, e.g., measuring the photon emission following
the photo excitation [9, 10, 11, 12].
It turns out that
this signal reveals the splitting of the He+ threshold due

to spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, in some experiments
[13, 14] partial photoionization cross sections following
photoabsorption into doubly excited states have been
measured, most recently up to energies of the N = 5 ex-
citation threshold of He+ [15]. In the latter work similar-
ities between partial cross sections belonging to diﬀerent
manifolds have been observed and related to the propen-
sity rules for doubly excited states [16, 17, 18]. This type
of similarity has to be distinguished from intramanifold
similarities of partial photo cross sections such as mir-
roring and mimicking, as ﬁrst noted by Liu and Starace
[19].

in-
In the present work we explore the origin of
termanifold similarities of partial photoionization cross
sections in detail. As a function of increasing excitation
energy we will describe and explain how these similarities
emerge and begin to disappear again for very high exci-
tation. To this end, we have calculated the partial ion-
ization cross sections up to the ninth threshold of He+.
The corresponding energies are much higher than those
which were reached previously, experimentally as well as
numerically. This allows us to work out the similari-
ties of the cross section pattern across eight manifolds
and to illustrate in detail how the propensity rules lead
to those similarities. Our results conﬁrm Menzel’s con-
clusions for the energy regime he considered. Perturber
states, emerging as a new feature at higher excitation en-
ergies, seem to destroy the similarity pattern. However,
as we will show, a regularization based on an energy-
dependent quantum defect can be introduced which re-
stores the similarities even in the presence of isolated
perturbers. The paper is organized as follows: In sec-
tion II we present the partial cross sections and brieﬂy
describe computational details. In section III we brieﬂy
summarize the propensity rules for dipole excitation and
for autoionization of two-electron resonances, as well as
their classiﬁcation schemes. We also recall adiabatic two-
electron potential curves which facilitate the understand-
ing of the classiﬁcation and propensity rules, before we

formulate the general scheme of the intermanifold pat-
terns with the help of the propensity rules.
In section
IV we interpret the patterns of the partial cross sections
across the manifolds with this scheme. The paper ends
with a summary in section V.

II. PARTIAL PHOTOIONIZATION CROSS
SECTIONS OF HELIUM UP TO THE N =9
LEVEL OF HE+

A. Numerical procedure

In the present study,

the eigenchannel R-matrix
method [20, 21] combined with a close-coupling scheme
[22] is employed in order to calculate the partial cross
sections for single photoionization of the helium atom.

The eigenchannel R-matrix method has been success-
fully applied to single photoionization [23] and photode-
tachment [24] of atomic systems with two active elec-
trons. The most important concept of the R-matrix the-
ory is to partition the conﬁguration space into two re-
gions, namely the reaction region, where the short-range
interactions between one particle and a compact target
are complicated, and the external region, where the sys-
tem can be reduced to a two-body problem involving
long-range interactions. For the current study, the reac-
tion region is that part of six-dimensional conﬁguration
space for which both electron lie within a sphere of ra-
dius r0. The reaction surface Σ is the set of points for
which max(r1, r2) = r0, where r1 and r2 are the electron
distances from the nucleus. The method has been de-
scribed in detail in the literature [21, 22, 25]. Therefore,
we present here only a brief overview and some numerical
details.

Within the reaction region, using a set of Slater-
determinants composed of properly chosen one-electron
orbitals, the electron-electron interaction is fully taken
into account by applying bound-state conﬁguration in-
teraction techniques. At a given energy the eigenchannel
R-matrix method aims to determine varationally a basis
set of wavefunctions, the so-called R-matrix eigenchannel
wavefunctions, which are orthogonal and complete over
the reaction surface Σ enclosing the reaction region, and
their negative logarithmic derivatives being constant over
Σ. The helium wavefunctions of experimentally observed
channels can be represented by linear combinations of the
eigenchannel wavefunctions thus constructed within the
reaction region.

In the external region, since only single ionization pro-
cesses are considered, it is assumed that there is only a
single electron while the other electron is bound. Instead
of applying the conventional multichannel quantum de-
fect theory [21], Pan et al.
[22] developed an approach
using a close-coupling scheme to obtain a basis set of
multichannel wavefunctions which describe the outgoing
electron and the residual ion. In addition to the Coulomb
potential, all multipole interactions in the external region

2

are included numerically to account for the polarization
of the residual ion. Note that, although the asymptotic
behavior of a one-electron continuum wavefunction in a
Coulomb ﬁeld is well known [26], this description of a
singly ionized state in a two-electron atom it is exact
only at an inﬁnite distance from the nucleus. Since one
can only integrate the close-coupling equation starting
from a ﬁnite distance, we use WKB representations [27]
for the wavefunction instead at a suitably large distance.
To describe an experimentally observed channel, one has
to form a linear combination of these multichannel basis
wavefunctions according to the incoming-wave boundary
condition [22].

By matching the linear combinations of the multichan-
nel basis functions for the two regions, one can determine
(−) which describe
the exact ﬁnal state wavefunctions Ψi
the experimentally observed channels i. The partial cross
sections can be calculated according to the standard for-
mula [28]:

σi =

4π2ω
c

|hΨi

(−)|D|Ψ0i|2,

(1)

where ω is the photon energy, D is the dipole opera-
tor, and c is the speed of light. The wavefunction Ψ0 in
Eq. (1) denotes the helium ground state.

In the present study, the radius r0 of the R-matrix
sphere is chosen to be 200 a.u.. A total of 1080 closed-
type (i.e., zero at the radius r0) and 20 open-type (i.e.,
non-zero at the radius r0) one-electron wavefunctions
with orbital angular momentum up to 9 are included.
9610 closed-type two-electron conﬁgurations are included
in the calculation for the ﬁnal state wavefunction. For
each channel in which one electron can escape from the
reaction region, two open-type orbitals for the outer elec-
tron are included in addition to the closed-type basis set.
For a given photon energy, besides all open channels, rel-
evant closed channels are also included in the calculations
(cf. [22]).

B. Typical cross sections

Our calculated total photo cross section below the
N = 3, 7, and 9 threshold are shown in Fig. 1 together
with experimental data by Kaindl and co-workers [4, 29].
Since no absolute photoionization yields are measured in
these experiments we have scaled the experimental data
to our results. As can be clearly seen the calculated cross
section is in excellent agreement with the experimental
one.

Fig. 2 shows the total and partial cross sections below
the N = 5 threshold of He+. Note that below a given
threshold N we are dealing with N − 1 partial cross sec-
tions σN,N ′ (N ′ = 1, . . . , N − 1), where N ′(< N ) de-
notes the principal quantum number of the residual he-
lium ion. Hence, in the case of the N = 5 threshold we
are concerned with four partial cross sections, namely,
σ5,1 . . . σ5,4. The agreement with existing experimental

parison with experimental results of Refs. 4, 29 below the
thresholds (a) N = 3, (b) N = 7, and (c) N = 9. The theo-
retical data (thick lines) has been shifted upwards to allow for
an easier comparison with the experiment (thin lines). More-
over, the numerical data has been convoluted with a Gaussian
of 5 meV width for N = 3, 7 and 2 meV for N = 9. In (a) and

data [15] on an absolute scale is in general good. Inter-
estingly the cross section in acceleration gauge (dashed)
is higher than in velocity gauge (solid) and higher than
the experiment for the partial cross section N ′ = 1. For
all other partial cross sections the velocity gauge result
is too high and the acceleration gauge matches the ex-
periment better. The total cross section behaves as the
N ′ = 1 partial cross section by which it is dominated.
This observation of numerical accuracy points to a fun-
damental diﬀerence of the N ′ = 1 cross section compared
to all other partial cross sections which is also conﬁrmed
by the fact that N ′ = 1 takes about 90% of the yield
while the yield for the higher partial cross sections de-
creases with increasing N ′ but only slightly.

Since we focus on the general patterns of the partial
cross sections which agree in both gauges very well with
experiment the minor discrepancies in the absolute value
are of no concern.

Partial cross sections of the resonances converging to the
N = 9 threshold of He+

The ninth threshold is only about 0.67 eV below the
double ionization threshold. Partial cross sections for the
N = 9 manifold have neither been measured nor been
calculated so far. Based on the good agreement of the
total cross section with the experiment (see Fig. 1) we
believe that our calculation in this energy range is still
reliable. As can be seen in Fig. 3 the regular sequences
of Rydberg series observed for lower manifolds appear to

3

be lost. However, even if a regular Rydberg progression
exists it is very diﬃcult to identify it at a ﬁnite energy
resolution since the peaks accumulate towards threshold.
For this reason we will use an alternative way to represent
the cross section data.

Unfolding cross sections

To make all peaks of a Rydberg progression in a cross
section clearly visible which is particularly important for
analyzing similarities in the patterns of cross sections
we re-parametrize the energy according to the eﬀective
quantum number. An ideal unperturbed Rydberg series
converging to a threshold N of the He+ ion would have
equidistant peaks as a function of the eﬀective quantum
number

threshold where we have scaled the energy axis according
to Eq. (2). The constant spacing of the resonances indi-
cates unperturbed Rydberg series. Note also that the two

arose from the introduction of the so-called molecular
adiabatic approximation. This approximation is similar
to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for a diatomic
molecule, namely H +
2 , but with reversed roles of electrons
and nuclei. In two-electron atoms it is the interelectronic
axis R which is taken as adiabatic, i.e., slow variable in
analogy to the internuclear axis in H +
2 . In this picture
the doubly excited states naturally appear as vibrational
eigenstates in the adiabatic potential curves (cf. Fig. 5).

The probably most simple way of understanding the
quantum numbers is to interpret them as the Stark quan-
tum numbers of the inner electron whose Coulomb mo-
tion is perturbed by the electric ﬁeld of the outer elec-
tron. The quantum numbers remain the same along a
Rydberg series when the outer electron’s quantum num-
ber n increases to inﬁnity (single ionization limit) and
the inner electron remains in the N th excited state of
the ion, where N = N1 + N2 + m + 1 is the sum of the
Stark quantum numbers. Note, that the classiﬁcation
will be relevant to understand the pattern in partial ion-
ization cross sections since it is also applicable to singly
ionized two electron states (i.e., continuum states). The
Stark quantum numbers (often called parabolic quantum
numbers) are related to Herrick’s scheme by T = m and
K = N2 − N1. The label A denotes the symmetry with
respect to the line r1 = r2 in the wavefunction where
the ri are the electron-nucleus distances. The complete
signature of a two-electron resonance is then [N1 N2 m]A
n
or N (K, T )A
n . For the classiﬁcation of resonance states in
helium photoionization from the ground state one very
often uses a simpliﬁed Herrick’s notation, namely, N, Kn,
where the other quantum numbers are redundant due to

partial cross sections He+(N ′ = 1) and He+(N ′ = 3) in
Fig. 4 behave quite similarly while He+(N ′ = 2) mirrors
their pattern. This mirroring and mimicking behavior of
partial photo cross section is a universal intramanifold
feature [19].

So far, we have presented illustrative examples for the
cross sections to highlight the accuracy of our calculation.
We will systematically present the intermanifold similar-
ities between certain partial cross sections and discuss
their origin in the next two sections. The relations be-
tween certain chains of partial cross sections as well as
the interpretation which resonances contribute to them
is based on the existence of approximate quantum num-
bers and propensity rules for the resonances which we
will discuss ﬁrst.

III. APPROXIMATE QUANTUM NUMBERS
AND PROPENSITY RULES

Over the last 20 years a scheme of approximate quan-
tum numbers for doubly excited states has been devel-
oped which reﬂects the correlated two-electron dynam-
ics. They have been expressed as N (K, T )A by Her-
rick and co-workers [30] and assigned to hyperspheri-
cal potential curves by Lin [31]. Feagin and Briggs [32]
gave a justiﬁcation for the quantum numbers in terms of
constants of motion for a separable Hamiltonian which

that survives for the full dynamics as a propensity rule.
Here, we are interested in photoabsorption into doubly
excited states from the ground state of helium. The ﬁnal
A = +1 states with the admixture of lower channels for
the relatively best overlap with the ground state can only
be m = +1 states due to the 1P o symmetry. Therefore,
we expect a preference for

transitions (i.e., ∆m = 1).
In each manifold N there
is only one series [0 (N − 2) 1]+ fulﬁlling this condition.
This series is commonly referred to as the principal series
in the literature. Other series (with A = +1) are also
populated without the preference of ∆N1 = 0. However,
they carry much less oscillator strength.

FIG. 5:
Schematic representation of adiabatic potential
curves. In the adiabatic picture the resonances appear as vi-
brational eigenstates. The mechanism of autoionization relies
on non-adiabatic transitions in this description. The dashed
lines indicate the avoided crossings of the potential curves
which play an important role in the derivation of the propen-
sity rules (see Ref. 6).

the dipole selection rules (see Fig. 1). For a more com-
plete comparison between the diﬀerent quantum numbers
see [6, 18].

The approximate constants of motion for correlated
two-electron dynamics expressed through the approxi-
mate quantum numbers imply a nodal structure for the
respective resonance states [33]. In turn this nodal struc-
ture leads to preferences for autoionization [16] and (ra-
diative) dipole transitions [34].

A. Propensity rules for radiative transitions

Propensity rules for radiative transitions can be de-
rived by analyzing the dipole matrix elements according
to the nodal structure of the resonance wavefunctions,
which is a simple analytical task on the potential saddle
for 2~r ≡ ~r1 + ~r2 = 0. This region in conﬁguration space
is most relevant for symmetrically excited electrons with
N ≈ n. It corresponds to the equilibrium geometry of a
linear ABA molecule [35]. Not surprisingly, the relevant
quantum number

v2 = 2N1 + m

(3)

for radiative propensities quantizes the two-fold degen-
erate bending motion of triatomic molecules and can be
derived by normal mode analysis about the saddle point
[34, 36]. Dipole matrix elements within the saddle ap-
proximation follow the selection rule

∆v2 = 0, ±1

(4)

B. Propensity rules for non-radiative transitions

The mechanism of autoionization relies on non-
adiabatic transitions in the (molecular) adiabatic picture.
The rules for autoionization can be stated by establishing
a preference for nodal changes in the wavefunction.

Most easily, N2 can be changed which is the preferred
decay mode. This is achieved in the molecular descrip-
tion (as well as in the hyperspherical one) by so called
radial coupling matrix elements which are large between
states which diﬀer only in N2. Rotational coupling is only
slightly less eﬀective and changes the quantum number
m. Finally, there is no mechanism to change N1. Hence,
a resonance decays only through changing N1 if no other
possibility exists.

In parallel, the symmetry A plays an important role.
In general, states with A = +1 decay more easily than
states with A = −1 which can be seen from the narrower
avoided crossings for A = +1 leading to larger radial cou-
plings compared to A = −1 states. We may summarize
the propensity rules for autoionization [16] according to
the relative eﬃciency of the underlying decay mechanism:

(A)
(B)
(C)

reduction of N2
change of m
reduction of N1.

(6a)
(6b)
(6c)

These propensity rules group the 1P o resonant states
of helium into three classes I-III with typical widths sep-
arated by at least two orders of magnitude, ΓI : ΓII :
ΓIII ≈ 104 : 102 : 1. Since the propensities depend on the
nodal structure [N1 N2 m] of the inner electron, they hold
for entire Rydberg series (diﬀerent n) characterized by a
single [N1 N2 m] conﬁguration. III. class states for 1P o
resonances are restricted to the [(N − 1) 0 0]− conﬁgura-
tions, which enforce decay through a ∆N1 6= 0 transition
(C).

C. Propensities for partial photoionization cross
sections

We proceed now to formulate the conditions for the
similarity in patterns of partial photo cross sections based
on the exisiting propensity rules. The propensity rule (A)
characterizes by far the most important mechanism for
autoionization and it is this decay mechanism which also
determines the similarity patterns.

So far we have already used the terms conﬁguration
and manifold. A conﬁguration is a set of two-electron
states characterized by the quantum numbers [N1 N2 m]A
which refer to the state of the inner electron in the cor-
related two-electron state. A manifold N of two-electron
states contains all conﬁgurations whose quantum num-
bers add up to N = N1 + N2 + m + 1. Physically, one can
think of N being the principal quantum number of the
electron in the He+ ion which would remain if the outer
electron would be taken away. In the adiabatic picture
a conﬁguration is represented by a potential curve (see
Fig. 5). This illustrates that the actual state of the outer

a bound state with quantum number n in the potential
curve corresponding to a resonance for the two-electron
system. This type of states we call in the present context
intermediate conﬁguration. The outer electron can also
be in the continuum characterized by the potential of the
conﬁguration of the inner electron. This type of states we
call ﬁnal conﬁguration. It is important to realize that all
the propensity rules refer to the nodal character induced
by the conﬁgurations only, i.e. to a ﬁrst approximation,
the state of the second electron being a Rydberg electron
n or in the continuum is irrelevant for these propensities.
However, this does not mean that we deal with indepen-
dent electron states. Rather the Stark quantum numbers
of a conﬁguration for the inner electron characterize a
whole set of correlated two electron states.

Photoionization proceeds from the initial state (here
the ground state of helium) either directly or via a reso-
nance of the intermediate conﬁguration to the ﬁnal con-
ﬁguration. Particularly the partial cross sections σN,1
have a strong direct channel (simply the photoionization
of one of the electron). This is seen in the large smooth
background cross section (e.g., Fig. 2) for the N ′ = 1
partial cross sections.

To form a partial cross section σN,N ′ one has to take
into account all accessible intermediate and ﬁnal conﬁgu-
rations. The propensity rules can be used to structure the
contributions of diﬀerent conﬁgurations and they deter-
mine which of these conﬁgurations contribute dominantly
to the cross section.

2. The chain of similar partial cross sections with
dominant conﬁgurations only

Suppose we excite from the ground state only the con-
ﬁgurations [0 (N −2) 1]+, N = 2, 3, . . . , i.e. all the princi-
pal series. This yields partial cross sections ˜σN,N ′ which
already show the main features of the physical cross sec-
tions, and consequently, their similarity patterns. The
most eﬃcient autoionization mechanism is governed by
propensity rule (A), i.e., by reducing the quantum num-
ber N2. Hence, the dipole excited intermediate conﬁgu-
ration [0 (N − 2) 1]+ will lead to a dominant ﬁnal conﬁg-
uration [0 (N ′ − 2) 1]+ for the partial cross section ˜σN,N ′
with the change in N2 being ∆N = N − N ′. The idea
is now that partial cross sections in diﬀerent manifolds
look similar if their ﬁnal conﬁgurations have an identi-
cal diﬀerence ∆N = N − N ′ in the quantum number
N2 with respect to the respective intermediate conﬁgu-
rations. Fig. 6 shows the partial cross sections across the
manifolds N with ∆N = 1. Apart from the ﬁrst cross
section σ2,1 all patterns look fairly similar as predicted.
There are local perturbations marked as “PT” and one
also notes that the similarities become weaker for the
highest cross section shown, namely σ9,8. Both of these
anomalies we will discuss later, after we have explained

why σ2,1 looks so diﬀerent. This is easy to understand
because the principal intermediate conﬁguration [0 0 1]+
in the N = 2 manifold cannot decay through ∆N2 to the
N = 1 manifold since N2 = 0 to begin with. Rather,
[0 0 1]+ decays by changing A and m to [0 0 0]− which is
not the preferred decay route.

Therefore, a chain of similar cross sections has a lower
end deﬁned by the (N1, m) quantum numbers of the
contributing chain of conﬁgurations and its diﬀerence
∆N2 = N − N ′ in N2:

Nmin = N1 + m + ∆N2 + 1 .

(7)

In our example with N1 = 0 and m = ∆N2 = 1 we have
Nmin = 3, therefore, σ2,1 does not belong to the chain.

3. The partial cross section chain including all
conﬁgurations populated

A closer look on Fig. 6 reveals that there is still a small
change in the characteristic pattern from σ3,2 to σ5,4.
The reason is that in addition to the dominant interme-
diate conﬁguration [0 (N −2) 1]+ other conﬁgurations are
populated as well, each of them having its own chain of
similar patterns across the manifolds. The actual exper-
imental pattern is the sum of all these patterns. How-
ever, each chain has its individual lower end according
to Eq. (7). For instance the chain fed by the interme-
diate conﬁguration [1 (N − 3) 1]+ starts in the manifold

Nmin = 4 and does not contribute to σ3,2.
In fact ex-
cited from the ground state in helium [0 (N − 2) 1]+ and
[1 (N − 3) 1]+ are the two strongest intermediate conﬁg-
urations and we expect their chains to be suﬃcient to
understand the evolution of the regularity of the pat-
terns in the partial cross sections which will be discussed
in the next section. For simplicity we introduce a short
notation

CA
N1,m(∆N2)

(8)

to describe the chains where N1, m, A characterize the in-
termediate conﬁguration and determine the lower end of
the chain Nmin according to Eq. (7) while ∆N2 character-
izes the type of similar cross sections with ∆N = ∆N2
emerging from the chains. So far we have focused on
∆N2 = 1 (shown in Fig. 6) with the two dominant chains
C+
0,1(1) and C+

1,1(1).

IV. SYSTEMATICS IN THE PARTIAL CROSS
SECTIONS ACROSS THE MANIFOLDS FROM
N = 2 TO N = 9

We will now test the systematics for the patterns de-
scribed and illustrated in the last section for ∆N2 = 1
with cross sections of ∆N2 > 1. Thereby, we will also dis-
cuss the phenomenon of perturbers and the slowly dis-
appearance of the patterns for very high partial cross
sections, as mentioned in the last section.

A. Partial cross sections with ∆N = 2

We ﬁrst discuss the ∆N = 2 partial cross sections
shown in Fig. 7. The general pattern looks quite dif-
ferent compared to ∆N = 1 shown in Fig. 6. However,
among each other, the partial cross sections behave sim-
ilarly as in Fig. 6: The lowest curve σ3,1 does not match
at all the other curves, the next one, σ4,2, is still slightly
diﬀerent from the higher ones which are quite similar.
For σ8,6 and higher the patterns begin to fade out. We
ﬁrst note that the lowest possible partial cross section for
∆N = 2 is σ3,1. As for σ2,1 in Fig. 6 the dominant inter-
mediate conﬁguration [0 1 1]+ cannot decay according to
the preferred propensity rule ∆N2 = 2 but must decrease
the quantum number m and therefore change the quan-
tum number A from +1 to −1 in addition. Hence, σ3,1
does not belong to the chain of similar cross sections. To
the next higher one, σ4,2 contributes only the chain built
on the principal intermediate conﬁguration [0 2 1]+ with
Nmin = 4. For σ5,3 both dominant chains C+
0,1(2) and
C+
1,1(2) can contribute. Consequently, σ5,3 is the partial
cross section with the lowest N exhibiting the fully de-
veloped pattern of ∆N = 2 which one sees comparing
the clipping of σ5,3 to σ4,2 and σ6,4 (see dashed lines in
Fig. 7).

FIG. 8: Same as Fig. 6 but for the ∆N = 3 partial cross
sections.

B. Partial cross sections with ∆N = 3

These cross sections, shown in Fig. 8, have a character-
istic pattern, which is diﬀerent from the respective groups
characterized by ∆N = 1 and ∆N = 2. Yet, the system-
atics within the group is again the same as for the other
two groups and can be translated by simply increasing
N by one: The ﬁrst cross section σ4,1 looks extremely
diﬀerent since it does not belong to a chain. To the next
one only the chain from the principal intermediate con-
ﬁguration contributes, σ6,3 contains for the ﬁrst time the
characteristic pattern for ∆N = 3. However, since we
are already close to N = 8 where the patterns start to
fade out due to a beginning break down of the propensity
rules to which we ascribe their existence, we see only two
relatively similar cross sections, σ6,3 and σ7,4.

We summarize the systematics of the chains in Fig. 9
where all intermediate conﬁgurations are shown which
can decay according to propensity rule (A) [Eq. (6a)].
From Fig. 9 the lower end characterized by N, N ′ of

tions [0 N 0]− already starting at N ′ = 1 with σN,N ′=1
cross sections. However, as repeatedly pointed out, they
are too weak to be seen in the cross sections.

1. The role of isolated perturbers

the resonance states to which it couples. Firstly, it shifts
their positions (“bunching eﬀect”) which is expressed by
a jump in the quantum defect. Secondly, it modulates
their linewidth in a Fano-proﬁle like way. Both eﬀects
locally perturb the cross section pattern.

The bunching of the resonances is visible in the
cross sections σN =5,N ′ and σN =6,N ′ with the perturbers
N, Kn = 6, 46 and 7, 57, respectively. The distorting in-
ﬂuence on the pattern can be compensated by incorporat-
ing the quantum defect δN,Kn(E) of the perturbed series.
Plotting the cross section against the eﬀective quantum
number ν6(E) + δ6,4n (E), restores the characteristic pat-
tern of the cross section as can be seen in Fig. 10(b).
The eﬀective quantum defect compensates the bunching
of resonances on the energy axis. Therefore, this kind of
disentanglement works well, as long as the eﬀect of the
perturber on the width of the resonances is small as it
is the case for the cross sections σN =5,N ′ and σN =6,N ′.
The perturber 8, 68, however, causes a drastic narrowing
of the width of the state 7, 510. This perturbation of the
pattern cannot be compensated by expressing the energy
in terms of the eﬀective quantum defect. However, the
perturbation remains small and local leaving the general
pattern still identiﬁable as on can see in the cross sections
σ7,N ′ of Figs. 6,7, and 8.

2. Fading out of the patterns

Going to higher manifolds the patterns start to fade
out. This is certainly due to an increasing number of per-
turbers. However, in more general terms, this observa-

Before the pattern actually breaks down (see, e.g.,
Fig. 8) it can already be locally distorted by so called
perturber states. As is well known from quantum de-
fect theory [37], a perturber acts in a twofold way on

experimental data for both the total cross section up to
the N = 9 manifold and the partial cross sections up to
the N = 5 manifold.

A comparison of the partial cross sections σN,N ′ (N ′
denoting the state of the residual helium ion) across the
manifolds reveals common patterns in the cross sections
with the same ∆N = N − N ′. The patterns of the
principal series dominates with a seizable contribution
from strongest secondary series due to the large oscil-
lator strength of these series. The manifestation of the
patterns can be attributed to chains of conﬁgurations
which connect the intermediate conﬁgurations of reso-
nance states seen in the cross sections to ﬁnal conﬁgura-
tions in the diﬀerent continua according to the dominant
propensity rule for autoionization.

Starting with the N = 5 manifold perturbers emerge
which locally destroy the general patterns. However, in
cases where the perturber mainly leads to a bunching
of resonances on the energy axis, a regularization based
on energy-dependent quantum defects has been shown to
disentangle the spectra and restore the similarity of the
patterns. Going to manifolds N = 8 and higher the pat-
terns start to fade out which ﬁnally indicates the break-
down of the propensity rules. This in turn signals the
approaching limits of the adiabatic picture and the ap-
proximate quantum numbers derived from it.

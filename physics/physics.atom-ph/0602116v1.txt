A geometric algebra approach to the hydrogen atom

Jos´e B. Almeida∗
Universidade do Minho, Physics Department, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal
(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Monogenic functions in the algebra of 5-dimensional spacetime have been used previously by the
author as ﬁrst principle in diﬀerent areas of fundamental physics; the paper recovers that principle
applying it to the hydrogen atom. The equation that results from the monogenic condition is
formally equivalent to Dirac’s and so its solutions resemble closely those found in the literature.
The use of the monogenic condition as point of departure as not only the advantage of being a
uniﬁed approach but also provides very strong links with geometry that are completely lost in the
usual approach.

INTRODUCTION

depart from those works in many important aspects.

I have been advocating in recent papers that the ma-
jority of physics equations can be derived from an ap-
propriately chosen geometry by exploration of the mono-
genic condition. Monogenic functions are not familiar to
everybody but they are really the natural extension of
analytic functions when one uses the formalism of geo-
metric algebra [1, 2, 3]; those functions zero the vector
derivative deﬁned on the geometric algebra of the partic-
ular geometry under study.

In [4] I showed how special relativity and the Dirac
equation could be derived from the monogenic condition
applied in the geometric algebra of 5-dimensional space-
time G4,1. An earlier paper [5] proved that the same
condition in the same algebra was suﬃcient to produce a
symmetry group isomorphic to the standard model gauge
group; unfortunately this paper is incorrect in the for-
mulation of particle dynamics but the ﬂaw was recently
corrected;[6] the same work introduces electrodynamics
and electromagnetism in the monogenic formalism. Cos-
mological consequences were drawn from the addition of
an hyperspherical symmetry hypothesis with the conse-
quent choice of hyperspherical coordinates.[7] Summing
up all those cited papers, I wrote a long book chapter.[8]
The present paper uses the 5D monogenic condition to
study electron orbitals around a positively charged point
sized nucleus, a problem known in quantum mechanics as
the ”Hydrogen atom problem.” The equation that arises
from the monogenic condition applied in G4,1 algebra is
formally equivalent to the Dirac equation and so one ex-
pects that its solutions are also formally equivalent to
those obtained in relativistic quantum mechanics. It will
be shown, however, that obtaining the solutions is greatly
facilitated by the use of geometric algebra formalism and
also that the resulting formulas are much more compact
than standard ones and lend themselves to an easier ge-
ometrical interpretation. The derivations make use of
some methods and strategies drawn from Refs. [1, 2] but

II. SOME GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

Geometric algebra is not usually taught in university
courses and its presence in the literature is scarce; good
reference works are [1, 2, 3]. We will concentrate on
the algebra of 5-dimensional spacetime because this will
be our main working space; this algebra incorporates as
subalgebras those of the usual 3-dimensional Euclidean
space, Euclidean 4-space and Minkowski spacetime. We
begin with the simpler 5-D ﬂat space and progress to a
5-D spacetime of general curvature (see Appendix C for
more details.)

The geometric algebra G4,1 of the hyperbolic 5-
dimensional space we consider is generated by the co-
ordinate frame of orthonormal basis vectors σα such that

1,

(σ0)2 =
−
(σi)2 = 1,
σα ·

σβ = 0, α

= β.

(1)

Note that the English characters i, j, k range from 1 to 4
while the Greek characters α, β, γ range from 0 to 4. See
Appendix A for the complete notation convention used.
Any two basis vectors can be multiplied, producing
the new entity called a bivector. This bivector is the ge-
ometric product or, quite simply, the product, and it is
distributive. Similarly to the product of two basis vec-
tors, the product of three diﬀerent basis vectors produces
a trivector and so forth up to the ﬁvevector, because ﬁve
is the dimension of space.

We will simplify the notation for basis vector products
σαβ. The algebra is

using multiple indices, i.e. σασβ ≡
32-dimensional and is spanned by the basis

5 vectors, σα,

≡

Several elements of this basis square to unity:

(σi)2 = (σ0i)2 = (σ0ij )2 = (iσ0)2 = 1.

(2)

The remaining basis elements square to

1:

−

(σ0)2 = (σij )2 = (σijk)2 = (iσi)2 = i2 =

1.

−

(3)

Note that the pseudoscalar i commutes with all the other
basis elements while being a square root of
1; this makes
it a very special element which can play the role of the
scalar imaginary in complex algebra.

−

In 5-dimensional

spacetime of general curvature,
spanned by 5 coordinate frame vectors gα, the indices
follow the conventions set forth in Appendix A. We will
also assume this spacetime to be a metric space whose
metric tensor is given by

(4)

gβ;

gαβ = gα ·
the double index is used with g to denote the inner prod-
uct of frame vectors and not their geometric product.
The space signature is (
+ + + +), which amounts to
saying that g00 < 0 and gii > 0. If the coordinate frame
vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the
orthonormed ones, we have

−

gα = nβ

ασβ ,

(5)

where nβ
α is called the refractive index tensor or simply
the refractive index ; its 25 elements can vary from point
to point as a function of the coordinates.[9] In this work
we will not consider spaces of general curvature but only
those verifying condition (5); in those spaces we deﬁne
the vector and covariant derivatives (see appendix D).

III. DIRAC’S EQUATION

There is a class of functions of great importance, called
monogenic functions,[1] characterized by having null vec-
tor derivative; a function Ψ is monogenic in ﬂat space if
and only if

2

(8)

to the solution (7) and the derivative with respect to x4
is evaluated we get

( µ

+ σ4ip4)Ψ = 0.

∇

Let us now multiply both sides of the equation on the left
by σ4 and note that bivector σ40 squares to the identity
while the 3 bivectors σ4m square to minus identity; we
rename these bivectors as γ-bivectors in the form γµ =
σ4µ. Rewriting the equation in this form we get

(γµ∂µ + ip4)Ψ = 0.

(9)

∗

Invoking the isomorphism between G4,1 and the complex
algebra of 4
4 matrices, the only thing this equation
needs to be recognized as Dirac’s is the replacement of
p4 by the particle’s mass m; simultaneously we assign
the energy E to p0 and 3D momentum p to σmpm.[4, 6]
Alternatively we can multiply both sides of Eq. (8) by σ0
on the left to obtain the α, β form of the Dirac equation,
through the assignment αm

≡
Applying the monogenic condition to Eq. (7) we see

σm0, β

σ40.

≡

that the following equation must be veriﬁed

Ψ0(σαpα) = 0.

(10)

It has been shown[4] that p = σαpα is a null vector and
the wavefunction in Eq. (7) can be given a diﬀerent form,
taking in consideration the previous assignments

Ψ = A(

σ4m + p + σ0E)ei(Et+p·x±mτ +δ);

(11)

±

where A is the amplitude and x = σmxm is the 3-
dimensional position. Although Ψ does not look like a
column Dirac spinor, it has the same number of compo-
nents and can be written in that form, if desired.

In Eq. (8) we used i as imaginary in the exponent but
the monogenic condition would be equally veriﬁed if we
had chosen any other algebra element whose square was
minus unity; in [5] the various possible such elements are
analysed and discussed; in the present work we will not
explore such possibility. Applying the vector derivative
to this solution we have

Ψ = (Eσ0

mσ4)iΨ + ∇Ψ = 0.

(12)

∇

±

IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC POTENTIALS

Ψ = 0.

∇

A monogenic function is not usually a scalar and has by
necessity null Laplacian, as can be seen by dotting Eq.
(6) with

on the left; it has solutions of the type

∇

Ψ = Ψ0ei(pαx

+δ).

α

The Dirac equation can be derived from the monogenic
condition, as shown in [4] and brieﬂy remembered here.
For this eﬀect it will be convenient to expand the mono-
+σ4∂4)Ψ = 0. If this is applied
genic condition (6) as ( µ

∇

(6)

(7)

When working in curved spaces the monogenic condi-
tion is naturally modiﬁed, replacing the vector derivative
with the covariant derivative D. A generalized mono-
∇
genic function is then a function that veriﬁes the equation

DΨ = 0.

(13)

Remembering that an electron has minus unit charge
in our units’ system, for an electron with rest mass m in
the presence of an electromagnetic potential A we have
to consider the reciprocal frame (see [6] and [7])

gµ = σµ,

g4 = −

σµ + σ4,

(14)

Aµ
m

which corresponds to the refractive index frame

g0 = σµ +

σ4,

g4 = σ4;

it is easily veriﬁed that gαgβ = δα
β, as required by the
deﬁnition of reciprocal frame. The covariant derivative
is then

D = σ0∂0 + ∇ +

(cid:18)
We expect solutions of Eq. (13) that are harmonic in t
and τ , which we write as Ψ = ψ(xm) exp[i(Et
mτ )],

gating wave. The monogenic condition becomes

making the necessary changes to conform to our mono-

The wavefunction Ψ is multiplied by a vector on both
sides of Eq. (19) but the vector on the lhs has only 3D
components while the vector on the rhs has only σ0 and
σ4 components; this arrangement is particularly useful to
study commutativity of operators, as we shall see. Sup-
that commutes with both ∇
pose we have an operator
and
,

that is
Ψ = oΨ; Eq. (19) is then automatically veriﬁed.
Our task is then to ﬁnd the operators that verify the
commutation conditions and solve for their eigenstates;
this procedure is very similar to what is done in quantum
mechanics for the hydrogen atom.

In order to solve Eq. (18) we make the ansatz Ψ =

t contains all the angular dependence and
R is a function of r, t and τ only. We note also that
∇R = 0; in terms of this operator we can write

constant. We will multiply Eq. (19) on the left by x

ATOM

It is useful to analyse the ground state in order to
ﬁnd the character of the series coeﬃcients. Since this
is a spherically symmetric solution we ignore the θ and
ϕ dependence. At large r we can neglect the angular
dependence of σr and a second order equation can be
written for ψ(xm) as

VIII. CONCLUSION

The relativistic solutions for the hydrogen atom can be
derived from the monogenic condition applied to func-
tions in the algebra of 5D spacetime. When the space is
bent by the consideration of a central potential, the equa-
tion that follow from the monogenic condition is formally
equivalent to Dirac’s and so one could expect equivalent
solutions from the onset. The paper revisits the solutions
of that equation applying the formalism consistent with
the monogenic condition.

There is nothing fundamentally new in the paper, in
the sense that the energy levels that one obtains with
the monogenic formalism are the same that can be found
in the literature. However, the monogenic condition had
previously been applied in other areas of physics showing
high unifying potential; this work is just one further step
in the path of uniﬁcation. Besides that, the author be-
lieves the monogenic formalism to be easier to apprehend
than the more usual matrix formalism; this is a question
of taste, though.

APPENDIX A: INDEXING CONVENTIONS

In this section we establish the indexing conventions
used in the paper. We deal with 5-dimensional space
but we are also interested in two of its 4-dimensional
subspaces and one 3-dimensional subspace; ideally our
choice of indices should clearly identify their ranges in
order to avoid the need to specify the latter in every
equation. The diagram in Fig. 1 shows the index naming
convention used in this paper; Einstein’s summation con-
vention will be adopted as well as the compact notation
for partial derivatives ∂α = ∂/∂xα.

APPENDIX C: SOME COMPLEMENTS OF
GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

In this section we expand the concepts given in Sec. II,
introducing some useful relations and deﬁnitions. Start-
ing with the basis elements that square to unity Eq. (2),
repeated here,

(σi)2 = (σ0i)2 = (σ0ij )2 = (iσ0)2 = 1,

(C1)

it is easy to verify any of the above equations; sup-
pose we want to check that (σ0ij )2 = 1. Start by ex-
panding the square and remove the compact notation
(σ0ij )2 = σ0σiσjσ0σiσj, then swap the last σj twice to
bring it next to its homonymous; each swap changes the
sign, so an even number of swaps preserves the sign:
(σ0ij )2 = σ0σi(σj)2σ0σi. From the third equation (1)
we know that the squared vector is unity and we get suc-
cessively (σ0ij )2 = σ0σiσ0σi =
(σ0)2;
using the ﬁrst equation (1) we get ﬁnally (σ0ij )2 = 1 as
desired.

Note that the pseudoscalar i commutes with all the other

it a very special element which can play the role of the

The inner product is the same as the usual ”dot prod-

the a0b0 term; this is to be expected and is similar to
what one ﬁnds in special relativity. The outer prod-
uct represents an oriented area;
in Euclidean 3-space
it can be linked to the ”cross product” by the relation
cross(a, b) =
b; here we introduced bold char-
acters for 3-dimensional vectors and avoided deﬁning a
symbol for the cross product because we will not use it

APPENDIX B: NON-DIMENSIONAL UNITS

The interpretation of t and τ as time coordinates im-
plies the use of a scale parameter which is naturally cho-
sen as the vacuum speed of light c. We don’t need to
include this constant in our equations because we can
always recover time intervals, if needed, introducing the
speed of light at a later stage. We can even go a step fur-
ther and eliminate all units from our equations so that
they become pure number equations; in this way we will
avoid cumbersome constants whenever coordinates have
to appear as arguments of exponentials or trigonomet-
ric functions. We note that, at least for the macroscopic
world, physical units can all be reduced to four funda-
mental ones; we can, for instance, choose length, time,
mass and electric charge as fundamental, as we could
just as well have chosen others. Measurements are then
made by comparison with standards; of course we need
four standards, one for each fundamental unit. But now
note that there are four fundamental constants: Planck
constant (~), gravitational constant (G), speed of light
in vacuum (c) and proton electric charge (e), with which
we can build four standards for the fundamental units.
Table I lists the standards of this units’ system, fre-

quently called Planck units, which the authors prefer to
designate by non-dimensional units.
In this system all
the fundamental constants, ~, G, c, e, become unity, a
particle’s Compton frequency, deﬁned by ν = mc2/~, be-
comes equal to the particle’s mass and the frequent term
GM /(c2r) is simpliﬁed to M/r. We can, in fact, take
all measures to be non-dimensional, since the standards
are deﬁned with recourse to universal constants; this will
be our posture. Geometry and physics become relations
between pure numbers, vectors, bivectors, etc. and the
geometric concept of distance is needed only for graphical
representation.

again. We also used the convention that interior and ex-
terior products take precedence over geometric product
in an expression.

When a vector is operated with a multivector the inner
product reduces the grade of each element by one unit
and the outer product increases the grade by one. We
will generalize the deﬁnition of inner and outer products
below; under this generalized deﬁnition the inner product
between a vector and a scalar produces a vector. Given
a multivector a we refer to its grade-r part by writing
< a >r; the scalar or grade zero part is simply designated
as < a >. By operating a vector with itself we obtain a
scalar equal to the square of the vector’s length

The rotation angle is
and the rotation plane is deﬁned
by B. A rotor is deﬁned as a unitary even multivector
(a multivector with even grade components only) which
squares to unity; we are particularly interested in rotors
with bivector components. It is more general to deﬁne
a rotation by a plane (bivector) then by an axis (vector)
because the latter only works in 3D while the former is
applicable in any dimension. When the plane of bivector
B contains σ0, a similar operation does not produce a
rotation but produces a boost instead. Take for instance
B = σ01θ/2 and deﬁne the transformation operator T =
exp(B); a transformation of the basis vector σ0 produces

APPENDIX D: RECIPROCAL FRAME AND
DERIVATIVE OPERATORS

A reciprocal frame is deﬁned by the condition

gα

gβ = δα

β.

·

Deﬁning gαβ as the inverse of gαβ, the matrix product of
the two must be the identity matrix, which we can state
as

(C11)

= cosh θ + h sinh θ.

Using the deﬁnition (4) we have

The exponential of bivectors is useful for deﬁning rota-
tions; a rotation of vector a by angle θ on the σ12 plane
is performed by

(gαγgγ)

gβ = δα

β;

·

comparing with Eq. (D1) we determine gα

a′ = eσ21θ/2aeσ12θ/2 = ˜RaR;

(C12)

gα = gαγgγ.

8

(D9)

It would be easy to verify that it is also gαβ = gα
and gα = gαγgγ.

·

gβ

In many situations of great interest the frame vectors
gα can be expressed in terms of an orthonormed frame
given by Eqs. (1). If the frame vectors can be expressed
as linear combination of the orthonormed ones we have

a scalar operator, which consequently acts separately in
each component of a multivector. For 4 + 1 ﬂat space it
is

2 =

∇

∂2
∂t2 + i

2.

gα = nβ

ασβ ,

(D5)

One sees immediately that a 4-dimensional wave equation
is obtained zeroing the Laplacian of some function

where nβ
α is called the refractive index tensor or simply
the refractive index as said in the main text. When the
refractive index is the identity we have gα = σα for the
main or direct frame and g0 =
σ0, gi = σi for the
reciprocal frame, so that Eq. (D1) is veriﬁed.

−

The ﬁrst use we will make of the reciprocal frame is for
the deﬁnition of two derivative operators. In ﬂat space
we deﬁne the vector derivative

APPENDIX E: COMMUTATION RELATIONS

It will be convenient, sometimes, to use vector derivatives
in subspaces of 5D space; these will be denoted by an
upper index before the
and the particular index used
determines the subspace to which the derivative applies;
= σm∂m = σ1∂1 + σ2∂2 + σ3∂3. In
For instance m
5-dimensional space it will be useful to split the vector
derivative into its time and 4-dimensional parts

A←−B and in −→B A←−
∇

The second derivative operator is called covariant
derivative, sometimes also designated by Dirac operator,
and it is deﬁned with recourse to the reciprocal frame gα

D = gα∂α.

(D8)

Taking into account the deﬁnition of the reciprocal frame
(D1) we see that the covariant derivative is also a vec-
tor. In cases where there is a refractive index, it will be
possible to deﬁne both derivatives in the same space.

Vector derivatives can also be left or right multiplied

with other vectors or multivectors. For instance, when
∇
is multiplied by vector a on the right the result comprises
scalar and bivector terms
a. The scalar
part can be immediately associated with the divergence
and the bivector part is called the exterior derivative; in
the particular case of Euclidean 3-dimensional space it
is possible to deﬁne the curl of a vector by curl(a) =

σ123∇
We deﬁne also second order diﬀerential operators, des-
ignated Laplacian and covariant Laplacian respectively,
resulting from the inner product of one derivative opera-
tor by itself. The square of a vector is always a scalar and
the vector derivative is no exception, so the Laplacian is

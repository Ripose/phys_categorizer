Critically-bound four-body molecules

The (p, d, ¯p, ¯d) molecule, with a proton, a deuteron and their antiparticles, is stable againt spon-
taneous dissociation, but none of its three-body subsystems are stable. This molecule should be
built by combining two atoms, for instance a protonium (p¯p) and its heavier analogue (d ¯d). Most
other four-body molecules have at least one stable three-body subsystem and thus can be built by
adding the constituents one by one.

Bressanini et al. [1] have studied the stability of four-
charge systems with masses (M +, m+, M −, m−). For
M = m, this corresponds to the positronium molecule
Ps2, whose stability was ﬁrst demonstrated in 1947 [2].
For M ≫ m or M ≪ m, this is a hydrogen–antihydrogen
HH system (without annihilation, strong interaction,
etc.) which hardly competes with the deeply bound
protonium (M +M −) involved in the lowest threshold
(M +M −) + (m+m−). Stability is thus restricted to an
interval of M/m close to unity. The Monte-Carlo calcu-
lation of Ref. [1] leads to an estimate

which is conﬁrmed by a powerful variational method [3].
The case of three unit charges is well documented
[4, 5, 6], in particular for the (M ±, m∓, m±) conﬁgu-
rations. For M = m, this is the stable positronium
ion Ps−. For M ≫ m, we have (p, e−, e+), and for
M ≪ m, (¯p, p, e−), both unstable. Mitroy [7], using the
same stochastic variational approach as in Ref. [3], found
that stability is conﬁned to

0.70 . M/m . 1.64 .

Comparing the results (1) and (2) indicates a win-
dow for “Borromean” binding.
for
M/m = 2, which is the deuteron-to-proton mass ratio,
the (M +, m+, M −, m−) molecule is bound, but neither
(M ±, m∓, M ±) nor (m±, m∓, M ±) are stable.

For instance,

The word “Borromean” has been proposed in nuclear
physics to identify bound states whose subsystems are
unbound [8]. It comes from the Borromean rings, which
are interlaced in such a subtle topological way, that if any
one of them is removed, the two others become unlocked.
For instance, the 6He isotope of ordinary Helium is stable,
while 5He is not. In a three-body picture, this means that
the (α, n, n) system is bound, whereas (α, n) and (n, n)
are unbound.

For N > 3 constituents, one might deﬁne Borromean
binding as the property of all N ′-body subsystems be-
ing unstable, with N ′ = 2, or N ′ = N − 1, or N ′ < N .
We propose the following deﬁnition:A bound state is Bor-
romean if there is no path to build the system via a series
of stable bound states by adding the constituents one by
one. Then, (p, d, ¯p, ¯d) is Borromean. It is truly an atom–
atom composite, more representative of larger molecules
of ordinary chemistry. The same is true for neighboring
systems (m+
4 ) with less symmetry. A min-
imal extension of the domain of stability can be derived
using the variational principle [9].

In comparison, H2 or Ps2 systems appear to be more
robust, with several three-body subsystems being stable,
(p, e+, e−) or (p, p, e−) for H2, and (e±, e∓, e∓) for Ps2.
The positronium hydride PsH (p, e+, e−, e−) contains the
unstable (p, e+, e−), but also the stable (p, e−, e−) and
(e+, e−, e−), and thus is not Borromean.

Note that if the antideuteron is replaced by the cele-
brated Ω− hyperon (predicted by Gell-Mann by symme-
try considerations which led to the quark model, and dis-
covered by Samios et al. at Brookhaven [10]), and if the
deuteron is replaced by Ω+, the mass ratio M/m = 1.78
becomes close to one of the critical values of Eq. (2). If
A = (Ω−Ω+), we have an eﬀective (A, p, ¯p) three-body
system with both (A, p) and (A, ¯p) energies vanishing.
The Eﬁmov eﬀect [11] survives ﬁnite-size eﬀects, since
it is governed by the long range part of the interac-
tion. However, the Coulomb attraction between p and
¯p spoils the −1/ρ2 behavior (ρ is the hyperradius) nec-
essary in the hypercentral potential for Eﬁmov states to
appear. See, e.g., the approach by Fedorov and Jensen,
in Ref. [11].

This investigation grew out of discussions with Dario
Bressanini and Andr´e Martin. Comments by E.A.G. Ar-
mour, A.J. Cole, A.S. Jensen and K. Varga are also grate-
fully acknowledged. A partial and preliminary version of
this comment was presented at the Few-Body Conference
in Bled [9].

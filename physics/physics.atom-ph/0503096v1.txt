Abstract. We use Bloch oscillations to accelerate coherently Rubidium atoms. The variation of the velocity
induced by this acceleration is an integer number times the recoil velocity due to the absorption of one
photon. The measurement of the velocity variation is achieved using two velocity selective Raman π- pulses:
the ﬁrst pulse transfers atoms from the hyperﬁne state 5S1/2,
F = 1, mF = 0
i
into a narrow velocity class. After the acceleration of this selected atomic slice, we apply the second Raman
pulse to bring the resonant atoms back to the initial state 5S1/2,
. The populations in
(F = 1 and F = 2) are measured separately by using a one-dimensional time-of-ﬂight technique. To plot
the ﬁnal velocity distribution we repeat this procedure by scanning the Raman beam frequency of the
second pulse. This two π-pulses system constitutes then a velocity sensor. Any noise in the relative phase
shift of the Raman beams induces an error in the measured velocity. In this paper we present a theoretical
and an experimental analysis of this velocity sensor, which take into account the phase ﬂuctuations during
the Raman pulses.

1 Introduction

The measurement of the recoil of an atom when it absorbs
a photon provides a way to determine the ﬁne structure
constant α using atomic physics [1,2,3,4]. Since the ﬁrst
observation of the recoil-induced spectral doubling in the
CH4 saturated absorption peaks [5], only the development
of atoms cooling techniques renewed interest in measure-
ment of the recoil velocity vr ( vr = ¯hk/m, where k is
the wave vector of the photon absorbed by an atom of
mass m)[2,3,4]. The basic scheme of the photon recoil,
was previously proposed in reference [6] and a simple ver-
sion is illustrated in Fig.1: an atom in state
, at rest
in the laboratory frame, absorbs a photon from rightward
propagating laser beam with frequency ω. The atom re-
coils by ¯hk/m and the process has the resonance condition
deduced from energy conservation

alistic using velocity-selective Raman transitions [7]. Tran-
sitions of this kind have two relevant advantages: ﬁrst the
eﬀective frequency is the hyperﬁne splitting which is a
microwave frequency and the eﬀective momentum kick is
equal to that obtained with optical photons (large Doppler
shift). Second, as these transitions involve ground state
atomic levels, the linewidth of the stimulated transition,
and thus the width of the velocity distribution, is limited
only by the interaction time which is quite long when cold
atoms are used.

Let us consider an atomic cold sample where, after a
laser cooling process, the atoms, all in a well deﬁned inter-
nal state
, are illuminated successively by two velocity-
i
selective Raman π-pulses. The Raman excitation is real-
ized by two counter-propagating laser beams at frequen-
cies ω1 and ω2, and wave vectors −→k1 and −→k2. When the

After an acceleration which changes the mean velocity

second π-pulse and we shift the detuning to δmeas so as
we satisfy the resonance condition (equation (4)) for the

ignore this intermediate step and only focus on the study
of the velocity sensor described above. In the following we
investigate theoretically the number of atoms in the state
after the second π-pulse, starting by the determina-

tion of the Raman transition probability and taking into
account the relative phase noise between the two counter-
propagating beams. We then calculate the noise sensitiv-
ity of the velocity sensor and the ordinary variance of
the measured atoms. Finally, we present the experimental
set-up and discuss how the experimental compares with
our theoretical model. We underline that previously other
groups have studied the phase ﬂuctuations of the Raman
beams in atom interferometers [8,9]. The originality of this
work is to take into account the eﬀects of the phase ﬂuc-
tuations during the Raman pulses and not only between
the pulses.

2 Theory

The theory of velocity-selective stimulated Raman transi-
tions was been widely studied by [7,12]. In the subsection
2.1, we investigate the stimulated Raman transition prob-
ability considering the relative phase noise ϕ(t) (time de-
pendence) between the two beams. In subsection 2.2, we
consider the double π-pulse and we determine the frac-
tion of atoms at a given detuning δ of the Raman beam
frequency. We then deduce the sensitivity of the velocity
sensor by expressing the ordinary variance as function of
a power spectral density of the phase noise.

2.1 One pulse Raman transition

We consider an atom that has a level scheme shown in
Fig.2. with a ground state hyperﬁne interval ωHF S. This
atom is irradiated, along the z axis, by two counter-propagating
laser beams ( ω1, −→k1) and (ω2, −→k2).

We consider now an atom in internal state
with an
initial velocity vi along the beams axis. This atom is il-
luminated consecutively by two Raman π-pulses with the
same duration τ and separated by the time interval Tdelay
(see Fig.2). During the time interval between the two π-
pulses, the atom is accelerated to change its velocity by ∆v
(the ﬁnal velocity is then vf = vi + ∆v). Psel(δsel −
2kvi)
2kvf ) are respectively the probability
and Pmeas(δmeas −
to make the ﬁrst and the second Raman transition.

The experimental proceeding of the velocity sensor was
described in the ﬁrst section and illustrated in the Fig.2.
The atoms remaining in level
after the ﬁrst π-pulse, are

pushed away using a resonant laser beam. The distribution
velocity of the selected velocity class is supposed constant
along the width of the selection (n(v) = n0) (in fact, the
typical width of the initial distribution obtained with an
optical molasses in a few recoils, whereas the ﬁrst π-pulse
selects atoms in a velocity class of about vr/30). After the
second pulse, we measure separately the number of atoms
using two parallel, horizontally propa-
in state
gating probe beams, placed 15 cm below the center of the
trap and separated vertically by 1 cm. The number Nb of
atoms transferred by the second pulse is equal to the con-
tribution of all selected atoms weighted by the probability
to make the second π-pulse Raman transition:

2.3 Determination of the transfer function H(f, δ)

This function depends on the pulse interval on sin(πf Tdelay)

(see (28)): for each Tdelay there are certain frequencies at
which the phase noise does not have any eﬀect.

3 Experiment

An optical molasses loaded by a 3-D magneto-optical trap
provides a cold 87Rb atomic sample [4]. For the initial se-
lection and the ﬁnal measurement, the two Raman beams
are generated by two laser diodes injected by two grating-
stabilized extended-cavity laser diodes (ECLs). A fast pho-
todiode and a tunable RF frequency chain are used to
phase lock one ECL on the other one. The two beams have
linear orthogonal polarizations. After passing through the
vacuum cell, one beam is retroreﬂected by a horizontal
mirror (see Fig.3). A typical scan of ﬁnal velocity distri-
bution of Rubidium atoms transferred by the second pulse
, is

shown in Fig. (4.b). The noise level aﬀecting a measured
spectrum is not uniform: it is lightly greater on the slopes
than on the top. A better illustration of the noise distribu-
tion aﬀecting the spectrum can be achieved by plotting the
diﬀerence between the theoretical ﬁt and the experimen-
tal data (Fig.4). Thus is a proof that the spectral noise
is not yet dominated by the atomic shot noise (number
of detected atoms) but by the Raman phase noise. This
phase noise can arise from optical noise (laser noise, ﬁber
noise, phase lock noise, ...) or the vibration noise of the
retroreﬂection mirror (indeed, the velocity of the atoms is
measured in the frame of this mirror).

F = 1, mF = 0

F = 2, mF = 0

The resolution of our velocity sensor is then mainly
limited by the Raman phase noise. In the next section
we analyze the experimental results using the theoretical
model developed above considering only the vibrational
noise aﬀecting the retroreﬂection mirror.

and (25) give the same result for H(f, δ). In equation (25)
the noise density Φf is expressed in (rad/√Hz).

it can be written essentially as a sum of two contributions:

the velocity measurement can be illustrated by plotting a
predicted variance σP using the acceleration noise spectral
density (Fig.6.a) and the vibration sensitivity (Fig.6.b). It
appears that the main part of the vibration noise in our
experimental set-up comes from frequencies between 10
and 30 Hz (Fig.6.c).

As predicted by the theoretical model and illustrated
in the typical velocity distribution spectrum (Fig.4), the
noise of the velocity sensor depends on the Raman de-
tuning δ. By making several measurements at the same
detuning δ, we measure the statistical variance σP of the
transition probability of the two Raman pulses (Fig.7).

The good qualitative and quantitative agreements with
the predicted variance, allow us to conﬁrm that the the-
oretical model developed in this paper is a powerful tool
for quantifying and hence controlling the diﬀerent noises
of the Raman beams.

The time interval Tdelay is a critical parameter of the
experiment, it determines the number of additional recoils
transferred by the Bloch oscillations process and hence
the resolution of the photon recoil measurement. It will
be useful to understand how this parameter operates on
the uncertainty. In the Fig.8, the dots present the uncer-
tainty on the measured velocity in term of frequency. This

is obtained by substituting in the expression of the un-
certainty given by a least square ﬁt algorithm, the devia-
tion of the numerical data from the theoretical function,
by the theoretical mean uncertainty σP . In this plot the
noise increases with Tdelay and reaches a maximum value,
the noise decreases then, because the band pass of the ve-
locity sensor varies as 1/Tdelay and then it ﬁlters the high
vibrational noise frequencies.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have developed a simple theoretical tool,
to characterize the noise of an atomic velocity sensor.
We have focused on the phase ﬂuctuations of the Raman
beams during the pulse, such eﬀects are very important
in our non-interferometric velocity sensor where the reso-
lution is inversely proportional to the Raman pulses du-
ration. The experimental illustration was here limited to
the vibrational noise, but the model can be used for any
other phase noise at the limit of the validity of the pertur-
bative approach. This tool allows us to understand how
to implement the experimental improvements, essentially
the vibration isolation.

We thank A. Clairon and co-workers for valuable discussions.

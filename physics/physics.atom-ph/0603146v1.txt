Abstract

The screened QED corrections to the g factor of Li-like ions are evaluated utilizing an effective potential

approach. The evaluation is performed within the range of nuclear charge numbers Z = 32 – 92. The results

obtained serve for improving the theoretical predictions for the g factor of heavy Li-like ions.

High-precision measurements of the g factor of H-like carbon and oxygen [1, 2, 3, 4] stimu-

lated accurate theoretical calculations of this effect [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In particular,

these investigations provided a new determination of the electron mass to an accuracy which is

four times better than that of the previously accepted value (see Ref. [14] and references therein).

Moreover, an extension of these studies to higher Z systems could lead to an independent determi-

nation of the ﬁne structure constant [15, 16]. Investigation of ions with more than one electron is

also anticipated in the nearest future. In particular, measurements of the g factor of Li-like calcium

are currently in progress by the Mainz-GSI collaboration.

The motivation for studying Li-like ions alongside with H-like ions arises from the substantial

elimination of the uncertainty due to the nuclear size effects in a speciﬁc combination of the cor-

responding g factor values [17]. The most accurate results for different contributions and for total

values of the g factor of Li-like ions within the range Z = 6 – 92 were presented in our recent work

[18]. For all values of Z the uncertainty of the total value was mainly deﬁned by the contributions

of the interelectronic interaction and the QED screening effect. The latter was evaluated to the

leading order (α/π)(αZ)2/Z and calculations to all orders in αZ are needed for high values of

Z. In the present paper we perform this evaluation using an effective potential approach. The

obtained results are combined with other contributions to improve theoretical predictions for the

g factor of Li-like ions within the range Z = 32 – 92. Compared to our previous work [18], the

new theoretical values include also recent results for the higher-order two-loop QED corrections

[12] and the magnetic-loop part of the vacuum polarization [13]. In addition, the nuclear-size

correction is recalculated employing the most recent data for nuclear radii from Ref. [19].

The relativistic units (~ = c = m = 1) and the Heaviside charge unit (α = e2/(4π), e < 0) are

used throughout the paper.

The total value of the ground-state g factor of a Li-like ion is conveniently written as

g = gD + ∆gint + ∆gQED + ∆gSQED + ∆gnuc ,

where

is the Dirac value for the point-charge nucleus, ∆gint is the interelectronic-interaction correction,

∆gQED is the one-electron QED contribution, ∆gSQED is the screened QED correction and ∆gnuc

incorporates the nuclear-size, nuclear-recoil and nuclear-polarization corrections. For the eval-

uation of the interelectronic-interaction and nuclear corrections we refer to our previous papers

[17, 18] and references therein. Radiative corrections for electrons bound in a pure Coulomb ﬁeld

were addressed, in particular, in Refs. [5, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The main goal of the present work is to

evaluate the screened QED corrections within an effective potential approach.

We consider an effective spherically symmetric potential Veﬀ that partly takes into account the

interelectronic interaction between the valence 2s electron and the core electrons of the (1s)2 shell.

The simplest choice of Veﬀ is the core-Hartree (CH) potential

Here ρt is the total electron density, including the (1s)2 shell and the 2s electron. The parameter

xα can be varied from 0 to 1. The cases of values xα = 0, 2/3 and 1 are referred to as the Dirac-

Hartree (DH), the Kohn-Sham (KS) and the Dirac-Slater (DS) potentials, respectively. To provide

a proper asymptotic behavior, equation (4) should be replaced by [23]

Veﬀ(r) = −

at large r, where Nc is the number of core electrons. The self-consistent potential (4) is generated

by iterations, which continue until the energies of the core and valence states become stable on the

level of 10−9. The CH potential (3) does not imply self-consistency and, therefore, it is generated

after one iteration. When the effective potential Veﬀ and the spectrum of the corresponding Dirac

equation are generated, the screening correction ∆gSQED is calculated as the difference between

the two values of the QED correction calculated for the potential Veﬀ and for the nuclear potential

Vnuc,

∆gSQED = ∆gQED [Veﬀ] − ∆gQED [Vnuc] .

(6)

Below, we describe the evaluation of the one-loop QED correction to the g factor in arbitrary

binding potential. The QED correction of ﬁrst order in α appears as the sum of self-energy and
vacuum-polarization corrections, ∆g(1)

QED = ∆gSE + ∆gVP. The vacuum-polarization term is
relatively small, and its contribution to the QED screening can be neglected at the present level of

accuracy. The self-energy correction is given by the sum of irreducible, reducible and vertex parts,

∆gSE = ∆girr + ∆gred + ∆gver .

terms we follow Ref. [25] and calculate them in momentum space. The residual part of ∆girr,
so-called many-potential term ∆g(2+)

Both reducible and vertex parts are ultraviolet divergent, whereas the sum ∆gvr = ∆gver + ∆gred
is ﬁnite. Following Refs. [5, 11], we separate out the zero-potential term ∆g(0)
momentum space. The remaining many-potential term ∆g(1+)

is calculated in coordinate space as

vr and evaluate it in

vr

the point-by-point difference between the contributions (11) with bound and free propagators in

the self-energy loop.

Below we discuss some details, concerning coordinate-space calculations of ∆g(2+)

and

. Angular integration and summation over intermediate angular momentum projections

is carried out in the standard way. The many-potential terms involve inﬁnite summation over the

angular quantum number κ. The summation over the complete spectrum of the Dirac equation at

ﬁxed κ is performed using the dual-kinetic-balance approach [27]. The summation over κ is termi-

nated at |κ| = 10 – 20 and the rest of the sum is estimated by the least-square inverse-polynomial

ﬁtting. It was observed that more stable values are obtained, when subtraction (6) is performed

prior to the ﬁtting procedure.

The results obtained for the screened QED correction are presented in Table I. The uncertainty

of the numerical evaluation is deﬁned by the many-potential terms. The uncertainty due to incom-

pleteness of the effective potential approach in the description of the interelectronic interaction is,

however, much larger. It was estimated as the mean deviation of the results obtained by means

of the different potentials: core-Hartree, Kohn-Sham, Dirac-Hartree and Dirac-Slater. Since for

middle-Z ions the accuracy of our previous results [18] turns out to be better than that of the

present ones, in the ﬁnal compilation (see below) for Z < 30 we present the values of ∆gSQED

from [18]. We mention that these values include terms of higher order in 1/Z calculated by Yan

[28]. For Z > 30 we take the present data, obtained with the Kohn-Sham potential. While for

middle Z there is a good agreement between the present and the previous results, a signiﬁcant

discrepancy is found for high values of Z. This is presumably due to the fact that the method of

Ref. [18], based on the non-relativistic treatment of the anomalous magnetic moment, is rather

insensitive to the bound-state QED effects. The accuracy of the present evaluation of the screened

QED correction is limited by the possibility to account for the interelectronic-interaction effects in

terms of the local potential Veﬀ. A rigorous evaluation of the 1/Z contribution to ∆gSQED should

be the next step for improvement of the accuracy of the many-electron QED correction.

In Table II, the individual contributions to the g factor of the ground state of Li-like ions are

presented. The changes made compared with the previous compilation [18] concern several terms:

the one-electron QED correction, the screened QED correction and the ﬁnite-nuclear-size correc-

tion. The evaluation of ∆gSQED is already described above. The ﬁnite-nuclear-size correction is

recalculated with the most recent data for the nuclear radii [19]. The one-electron QED correction

of ﬁrst order in α is updated with the recent evaluation of the magnetic-loop vacuum-polarization
term [13]. This reduces the uncertainty of the ∆g(1)

QED term for Z > 30. The one-electron QED
correction of second order in α is improved for Z < 30 employing the analytical formula for the

(α/π)2(αZ)4 term recently derived in Ref. [12].

In summary, we have presented the evaluation of the screened QED correction to the g factor

of Li-like ions within the effective potential approach. These results improve the accuracy of the

theoretical predictions for the g factor within the range Z = 32 – 92, where stringent tests of the

bound-state QED effects are expected. More elaborated treatment of the interelectronic-interaction

and screened QED corrections will be the subject of our subsequent investigations.

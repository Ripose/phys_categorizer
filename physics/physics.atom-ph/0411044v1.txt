Abstract. Approximate approach for description of two-photon bremsstrahlung
emitted by the relativistic projectile scattered in a spherically-symmetric ﬁled of
the target is suggested.
It based on the accurate treatment of the analytical
structure of singularities in relativistic one-photon free-free matrix elements. For
the case of Coulomb ﬁeld of the target the closed-form analytical expressions for
amplitude and cross section of process with accounting for the radiation retardation
are presented. Results obtained within the frame of the proposed approach are
compared with available experimental data as well as with results of independent
theoretical calculations. It is demonstrated that accounting for relativistic eﬀects lead
to noticeable change of spectral-angular characteristics of two-photon bremsstrahlung.

1. Introduction

This paper is devoted to formulation of approximate approach for description of two-
photon (or double) bremsstrahlung (2BrS) which represent by itself the process of
sequential emission of two photons by the projectile particle scattered in a spherically-
symmetric ﬁled of the target [1, 2].

The aim of such research is in application of formalism of method called delta-
approximation and formulation on its basis the approximate approach for treatment
of 2BrS with accounting for relativistic and multipole eﬀects suitable for eﬀective
numerical investigations of characteristics of process in a wide range of projectile and
emitted photons energies for targets with diﬀerent values of nucleus charge Z. The
idea of delta-approximation, which was introduced for the ﬁrst time in non-relativistic
theory [3]–[6] and generalized recently for the case of relativistic collisions [7], is based
on the assumption that to a great extent the behaviour of 2BrS amplitude is deﬁned
by the contributions of the singular parts of one-photon free-free matrix elements
corresponding to transitions between two states of continuous spectrum, from which
the 2BrS amplitude is constructed.

The transitions of such type are encountered in a number of physical processes
in which the collision of projectile with a target (both structural or without internal
degrees of freedom) is accompanied by the emission or absorption of photons (see e.g.
reviews [8]–[10]).
(a) two-photon
In particular the list of such processes includes:
bremsstrahlung, (b) diﬀerent inelastic processes in which the emission (absorption) of
photons is accompanied by simultaneous excitation or ionization of the target (including
e
2 e + γ processes), (c) Compton scattering on many-electron atoms, (d) many-
photon ionization of atoms and ions.

When perturbation theory in photon-projectile (or photon-atom) interaction is
used to analyze the above-mentioned processes, the corresponding amplitude
can
be represented in terms of the compound matrix element in which the integration of the
intermediate momentum is carried out:

more photons, or if the photon emission occurs between two virtual states) describes

In [7] the explicit forms of all singular terms in (2), which include both the pole-like
singularities and the δ-function terms, in vicinities of the points (3) have been evaluated
and the general formalism of relativistic ‘delta’-approximation has been formulated for
the case of 2BrS process. The problem which arises in this connection concerns the
It is apparent that the exact
relativistic treatment of the 2BrS in a Coulomb ﬁeld.
relativistic formalism will be much more complex than that based on the non-relativistic
approach [4]. The fact that the results of previous non-relativistic ‘delta’-calculation [6]
are in good quantitative agreement with the exact results [4] stimulates the author to
put the eﬀorts in application of the relativistic version of the delta-approximation to the
case of scattering in Coulomb ﬁeld. This paper represent the results of such research.
The main advantage of the approach which will be described below in comparison with
exact treatment is in considerable reduction of numerical eﬀorts related to the evaluation
of the parameters of the 2BrS process with adequate accuracy.

In spite of the fact that in both non-relativistic and relativistic cases the formal
proof of adequacy of delta-approximation is not found, the indirect justiﬁcation of its
applicability can be based on the following facts.

(1) A number of detailed comparisons of results of compound matrix elements
calculations within the framework of delta-approximation against the results of exact
treatment and experimental data were made for non-relativistic collisions. For the dipole
photon case such comparison has been performed for the processes of 2BrS [3, 5, 11],
two- and three-photon detachment of electrons from the negative ions [12, 13]. Beyond
of the frame of dipole approximation comparison of cross sections of 2BrS was made for

non-relativistic electron scattering [4, 6]. It has been established that in all considered
cases the results of delta-approximation is in good agreement with results of exact
calculations and available experimental data [14]–[19].

(2) The fact that the relativistic expression for 2BrS amplitude in delta-
approximation is absolutely correct in two important limiting cases, which are (i) the
relativistic plane-wave Born approximation and (ii) the soft-photon approximation
(see [7] for details) serves as substantiation of applicability of this approach in relativistic
case. It was demonstrated in [7] that the relativistic formulae correctly reduce to their
analogues obtained earlier within the frame of the non-relativistic delta-approximation.
Method based on the relativistic formalism of delta-approximation developed in
the present paper allows to investigate the basic characteristics of 2BrS process in the
relativistic domain with accounting for the retardation eﬀects and multipole character
of radiation. Numerical results obtained on its base will allow to justify the adequacy
of delta-approximation in relativistic case.

2. Formalism

2.1. Amplitude and cross section of 2BrS process

The process of 2BrS (see ﬁg. 1) in potential scattering of projectile of charge Zpe and
mass mp in external spherically symmetric ﬁeld is a transition of the projectile from the
initial state ν1 = (p1, µ1) with momenta p1 and polarization µ1 (the corresponding
pc4) to the ﬁnal state ν2 = (p2, µ2) with momenta p2 and
energy ε1 =
p2
pc4) accompanied by the emission of two photons
polarization µ2 (ε2 =

The spectral-angular distribution of radiation d4σ/(dω1 dω2 dΩ1 dΩ2), is obtained
from diﬀerential cross section by integrating over direction of momenta of scattered
projectile p2 , summing over the photons polarizations λ1,2 and the polarization of the
scattered projectile µ2 and carrying out the averaging over the initial-state polarizations

δjl(ε) are the relativistic scattering phaseshifts depending on quantum numbers ε, j, l
and determined by the character of external ﬁeld (with accounting for contribution of
Coulomb counterpart in case of ionic target).

Using (7) it is possible to write down the partial wave expansion for amplitude
M2BrS. However from the computational point of view the direct calculation of 2BrS
amplitude with the help of such type expressions is practically impossible. Indeed after
substitution in (6) the partial wave series (7) and multipole expansions for operators
of an electromagnetic interaction ej γ e−ikjr we will get the tenfold sum on quantum
numbers of initial, intermediate and ﬁnal states of projectile and two pairs of indexes of
multipole expansions. Assuming (for an estimation) the number of partial terms for each
summation index equal 10 we shall estimate the total number of terms of considered
sum about 1010 that expels a possibility of direct calculation.

The alternative way of exact calculation of 2BrS amplitude, which detailed
consideration go beyond this paper, is based on Sternheimer approach [21].
Its idea
is in reduction of direct summation on complete set of intermediate states n in (6) to
calculation of a matrix element of the operator e2γ e−ik2r between ﬁnal state
ε2J2L2M2|
and some auxiliary function which is a solution of inhomogeneous Dirac equation.
Such an approach allows to evaluate the exact 2BrS amplitude with essentially less
computational eﬀorts in comparison with direct calculation of 2BrS amplitude and cross
section within the relativistic distorted partial wave approximation. In nearest future
authors plan to present the results of such investigation.

The aim of the present paper is to introduce an approximate approach for eﬀective
analysis of characteristics of 2BrS with accounting for both relativistic and multipole
eﬀects which supplements the exact relativistic treatment of the process within the
framework of Sternheimer approach.

The amplitude (6) represents by itself a compound matrix element which describes
the transition of projectile through the virtual intermediate state n. Consequently,
each one-photon matrix element in (6) has singularities in points determined by
relations (3). At integration over complete spectrum of intermediate states n singular
terms proportional to corresponding delta-functions add non-zero contributions to the
M[21]. As it was demonstrated in [6] within the framework of non-relativistic
M[12] and
theory the behaviour of total 2BrS amplitude is reproduced with satisfactory accuracy
if we accounts for these terms only. Such an approach to evaluation of 2BrS amplitude
was called ‘delta’-approximation.

Below in this section we overview the way of evaluation of expression for total
M2BrS in delta-approximation by reproducing only the basic expressions,
amplitude
which are required for the further consideration. The detailed scheme of construction
of approximate 2BrS amplitude in relativistic case which includes, in particular, the
derivation of singular parts of one-photon matrix elements (2), evaluation of their
M[12] and
contribution to
M[21] (see (6)) and writing down the ﬁnal expression for
M2BrS in delta-approximation is given in [7].

2.2. Singularities in relativistic one-photon free-free matrix elements

Singular terms in free-free matrix elements (2) appear as the result of integration over
the inﬁnite spatial region, where the asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunctions is as

It is seen from (11) and (14) that the singular part of (2) include the terms of
the following types: (i) the term, proportional to the three-dimensional delta-function

δ(pa −

(iii) Pole-like terms, proportional to

As it was noticed in [7], if both of the scattering states in (2) are real (i.e. not
virtual) then terms (i) and (ii) vanish, since the condition implied on the momenta
pa, pb and ¯hk by the delta-functions are not consistent with the energy conservation
law εa = εb + ¯hω. In this case the terms (iii) describe the well-known behaviour of the
free-free matrix elements in the soft-photon region. The δ-terms of types (i) and (ii)
become essential when considering the compound matrix element of the type (1) where
the integration over one of the momenta pa or pb (or over both momenta) is implied.
In this case formulae (2) describe the virtual one-photon transition.

2.3. Amplitude of 2BrS process in delta-approximation

Using the results of the previous section and accounting for the fact that all singular
terms belong to a positive-energy part of spectrum of intermediate states it will be
convenient to separate the contributions of positive-energy and negative-energy parts
of electronic propagator to terms
M[21] and to present the expressions for 2BrS
amplitude in delta-approximation in a form

terms correspond to the contribution of the negative-energy intermediate states to the
M2BrS. We emphasis that the delta-functional part is contained in the exact 2BrS
amplitude as an additive term, and hence its contribution can be treated independently
for arbitrary photon energies consistent with the conservation law (4). By neglecting
the contribution of the ﬁrst two term in (15) one ﬁnds the approximate expression for
the relativistic 2BrS amplitude within the frame of the ‘delta’-approximation. Let’s now
consider the remaining terms in (15).

One of the possible approximation for the negative-energy part of

M2BrS is discussed
in [7]. It represent by itself the analogue of non-relativistic sea-gull matrix element but
evaluated using the relativistic wavefunctions of the projectile:

Another way to take into account the contribution of two last terms in (15) is based
on rewriting of these terms within the framework of relativistic plane-wave Born
approximation. However, for the sake of brevity we will not reproduce corresponding
cumbersome expressions here. Moreover, for considered energy range of the projectile
(see section 3) corresponding to experimental data the representation (16) seems to be
quite enough.

(16)

To simplify the further consideration let us assume following [7] that the positive-
energy branch of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian ˆH(r) = cαˆp+γ0 mc2 +V (r) does not
contain the bound states. For a neutral atomic target and for an electron as a projectile
this assumption means that we disregard the possibility to form the negative ion. This
is not a crude approximation if one takes into account that for a relativistic electron
the contribution to the sum over the intermediate states ν of the process of virtual
excitation into the negative ion bound state (with εν = mc2
I and typical values for
I

several eV, see e.g. [22]) is negligible small.

The advantage of given representation is in considerable simpliﬁcation of numerical
procedures related to the evaluation of the parameters of 2BrS. It is the complexity of
the exact treatment which has led, so far, to the absence of any results for two-photon
transitions in the relativistic domain [7].

2.4. Method of computation: application to a point Coulomb ﬁeld

Below in this section we apply the developed approach to the case of relativistic projectile
scattered in a point Coulomb ﬁeld. As it will be demonstrated in this case it is possible
to obtain the closed-form analytical expressions for 2BrS amplitude and cross section
within the framework of delta-approximation.

The adequacy of usage of Coulomb ﬁeld approximation for description of the

scattering process is conditioned by the fact that at the collisions energies E
∼
50 . . . 100 keV (corresponding to experimental data [16]-[19]), for which the relativistic
treatment of process is required, the eﬀects of screening of the nucleus by the electron
cloud of the target don’t play a signiﬁcant role unlike the radiation retardation
eﬀect [4, 6, 27]. As it will be shown further the role of relativistic eﬀects for considered
region of projectile’s energies is also noticeable that results in necessity of accounting
for these eﬀects as well as for the radiation retardation.

In contrast to non-relativistic case the additional diﬃculty for application of
formalism of relativistic delta-approximation to the case of point Coulomb ﬁled
is connected with absence of the closed-form expressions for exact relativistic
wavefunctions corresponding to scattering states of projectile in the ﬁeld of the
target [1, 2]. The possible way to overcome this diﬃculty is in usage of approximate
relativistic continuum Furry-Sommerfeld-Maue (FSM) wavefunctions which accurate
up to the order Zα in the relativistic corrections and have the closed analytical
representation (see e.g. [1, 2, 23]). When the main contribution to cross section of
process is given by the partial waves with l
Zα or when the projectile’s energy is
large enough in comparison with its rest energy the FSM approximation results does not
essentially diﬀer from the results of exact calculations obtained within the framework
of relativistic distorted partial wave approach.

3. Numerical results

Approach presented in the previous sections was applied for calculation of spectral-
angular distributions of 2BrS formed in collisions of electron of kinetic energy of
E1 = 70 keV (except ﬁgure 6 for which E1 = 10 keV) with isolated atomic targets
in a wide range of values of nucleus charge Z (Z = 1 . . . 92). In ﬁgures 2, 4, 5 the energy
of the ﬁrst emitted photon is equal to ω1 = 20 keV while the energy of the second photon
lays in a range ω2 = 2.5 . . . 47.5 keV. In ﬁgures 3 and 6 curves are plotted for energies
ω1 = ω2 = 25 keV and ω1 = 1 keV, ω2 = 1 . . . 8.5 keV respectively.

Results presented in all graphs refer to a case of complanar geometry of emission
when the vectors p1, k1 and k2 lay in the same plane. Polar and azimuth angles
(θ1,2, ϕ1,2), which characterize the direction of emission of each photon, correspond
to coordinate system with axis z along the projectile’s initial momenta vector p1.
Because of the axial symmetry the cross section of process d4σ/(dω1 dω2 dΩ1 dΩ2)
d4σω1 ω2(Ω1, Ω2) depends only on diﬀerence (ϕ1 −
separately.

Numerical calculation of relativistic delta-amplitude of 2BrS (15) and its non-
relativistic analogue was carried out, respectively, with usage of FSM wavefunctions (20)
and non-relativistic Coulomb wavefunctions corresponding to scattering states of
the projectile in a central ﬁeld.
The results of relativistic Born calculations
presented in ﬁgures are obtained by programming of expressions presented in [7].
Curves corresponding to relativistic Born-Elwert approximation represent by itself the
relativistic Born curves corrected by the Elwert factor [25] (we use its relativistic
analogue proposed in [26]):

In ﬁgures 2–4 the comparison of results of calculation of 2BrS cross section
within the framework of relativistic delta-approximation with available experimental
data [16]–[19] and results of exact non-relativistic calculations with eﬀect of radiation
retardation taken into account (see ﬁgure 2) is presented. It is known [4, 6, 27] that eﬀect
of radiation retardation leads to noticeable growth of 2BrS cross section. As it is follows
from presented graphs accounting for relativistic eﬀects, in turns, results in decreasing of
magnitude of cross section. Qualitatively such situation can be explained in the following
way. Apart from the spin-related eﬀects, the general consequence of a movement with
relativistic velocities is the dependence of mass of a projectile on its velocity. Increasing
of projectile’s velocity leads to the increase of its mass m with respect the rest mass m0
v2/c2)−1/2. This eﬀect, in turn, reduces the magnitude of the eﬀective
as m = m0 (1
projectile’s acceleration in the ﬁeld of the target and, consequently, results in decrease
of the intensity of radiation.

≫

Presented dependences show that except the region of large Z

100 in ﬁgure 2,
where the relativistic curve well describing the experiment for small and moderate values
of Z underestimates expected magnitude of cross section, and point ω2 = 50 keV in
ﬁgure 4, most likely representing the experimental error, the results of calculation within
the framework of delta-approximation (both relativistic and non-relativistic) reproduce
available experimental data well.
In the case of ﬁgure 2 observable behaviour of a
relativistic curve can be caused by both insuﬃcient adequacy of FSM approach for
Z

1 and insuﬃcient accuracy of experiment (compare with ﬁgure 3).
Estimating the possible behavior of exact relativistic curve in ﬁgure 2 basing
on the diﬀerence between non-relativistic curves corresponding to exact and delta-
approximation calculations it is possible to suppose that it will describe available
experimental data better. In spite of the fact that in non-relativistic case the maximal
relative error between delta-approximation and exact curves is about 15% (for Z = 52).
it should be noticed that the results obtained within the framework of proposed approach
is much more exact than the results of plane-wave Born and Born-Elwert approximations
(both with and without relativistic eﬀects taking into account) which are also presented
on graphs.

In ﬁgure 5 comparison of the results of calculations of 2BrS cross section in
delta-approximation with exact non-relativistic results (with retardation included) is

in non-relativistic case the delta-approximation produces the results which are in the

approximation already noticed decreasing of magnitude of cross section is observed.
Moreover for various geometries of emission the amount of decreasing of cross section
is a few diﬀerent. At the present moment such a behaviour is not absolutely clear for
authors and requires additional investigation and comparison with the results of exact
relativistic calculations.

In the case of smaller values of energy of projectile (see ﬁgure 6) when the
inﬂuence of relativistic corrections is small the results of the proposed approach coincide
with results of exact non-relativistic calculations presented in [27] and results of non-
relativistic delta-approximation (for the avoidance of overloading of graphs the last
one are not plotted in ﬁgure 6) very well. Whereas the curves corresponding to
(relativistic) Born approximation strongly underestimate the magnitude of the cross
section (especially for high Z).
Some increase of distinction between relativistic
and exact non-relativistic curves with growth of Z can be caused by usage of FSM
wavefunctions in our calculations. However only the exact relativistic calculation as
well as in the case of ﬁgure 5 can clarify the situation completely.

In general, the results obtained within delta-approximation (both relativistic and
non-relativistic) well describe the behaviour of 2BrS cross sections in considered region
of collision energies and frequencies of emitted photons. The role of relativistic eﬀects
grows with increase of energy of projectile and nucleus charge of a target and appeared to
be noticeable in all considered cases that results in necessity of accounting for relativistic
eﬀects simultaneously with accounting for multipole character of radiation. Obtained
results allow us to consider the presented approach as adequate for description 2BrS
process and suitable for numerical investigation of basic characteristics of process (the
spectral intensity of radiation and its angular distribution) for various collisions regimes.

4. Conclusions

Basing on the numerical results presented above, proposed approach can be considered as
more reliable than another more simple relativistic approximations. It allows to simplify
considerably the analytical and, especially, numerical analysis of the two-photon free-
free transitions with accounting for the retardation and multipole eﬀects. It can be used
for carrying out eﬀective and reliable calculations of relativistic spectral and angular
distributions of 2BrS in a wide region of frequencies of emitted photons and collisions
energies. With minor modiﬁcations this approach can be used for the description of the
two-photon absorption process. However, regardless the outlined advantages of usage of
relativistic formalism of delta-approximation for description 2BrS process, the problem
which still remains concerns the exact treatment of the process.

In this connection it should be noticed that as well as in the case of one-photon BrS

process at consideration of two- and many-photon transitions in continuum spectrum it
is necessary to distinguish two leading mechanisms of radiation formation: the ordinary
(see e.g. [1, 2]) and polarizational (see e.g. [8]) mechanisms. The ﬁrst of them describes
the process of photon emission by a charged projectile accelerated in the static ﬁeld of a
target. The second one accounts for radiation of the target virtually excited by the ﬁeld
of projectile. In particular case of 2BrS one should consider three independent processes:
emission of two photons by a projectile, emission of one photon by a projectile and the
second photon by polarized target and emission of both photons by polarized target.
Therefore, the problem of exact treatment of 2BrS becomes of essentially complicated
character both from the analytical and from the computational points of view. However,
the fact that the ordinary mechanism of 2BrS dominates in the total spectrum of
radiation in a wide range of projectile’s energy and frequencies of emitted photons
allows in many cases to consider the ordinary mechanism only.

Actually, for the present moment the attempts of accounting for the contribution
of polarizational mechanism in 2BrS were limited by usage of non-relativistic Born
approximation [28]-[30]. For the case of collisions of relativistic particles the closed-
form theory of 2BrS (both with and without taking the polarizational mechanism into
account) was not developed and attempts of investigation of process do not go beyond
the usage of relativistic Born approximation (e.g. [31]) for treatment of ordinary 2BrS.
In view of already mentioned technical diﬃculties connected with direct calculation
of amplitude and cross section of 2BrS, presented in a form of partial-wave and multipole
expansion, two approaches represent the practical interest. The ﬁrst of them is based
on exact treatment of 2BrS process within the framework of FSM approximation (see
e.g. [23]) and is somewhat similar to the approaches, previously used in non-relativistic
theory [4, 27]. The second one, which is more universal approach, is based on general
formalism of Sternheimer approach [21] for calculation of amplitude of two-photon
transition between two states of a continuous spectrum. Development on the basis
of both mentioned approaches of fully relativistic formalism for 2BrS process is the
natural and straightforward continuation of the present research.

Figure 1. Feynman diagrams corresponding to the 2BrS process of a structureless
charged projectile scattered by the atomic target. The solid lines correspond to the
projectile wavefunctions satisfying the Dirac equation which accounts for the central
ﬁeld of the target (the Furry representation). The initial (index ’1’) and the ﬁnal (index
’2’) states of the projectile are characterized by the momenta p1,2 and the polarizations
µ1,2. The dashed lines designate the emitted photons γ1,2 = (ω1,2, k1,2, e1,2) of energies
¯hω1,2, momenta ¯hk1,2 and the polarizational vectors e1,2.

In ﬁgure the thick and the thin solid lines correspond
to results of relativistic and non-relativistic formalism of delta-approximation respec-
tively. The thick and the thin dashed lines are used for curves obtained within the
frame of relativistic and non-relativistic Born-Elwert approximation. The results of
exact non-relativistic calculation with accounting for radiation retardation (see [4])
are given by triangles.

and thin solid lines are used for curves obtained within the frameworks of relativistic
and non-relativistic versions of delta-approximation. The results of relativistic plane-
wave Born approximation and relativistic Born-Elwert approximation are plotted by
short-dashed and long-dashed lines respectively.

on energy of second emitted photon ω2 with experimental data presented in [17] for the
case of collision of electron with Au atom (Z = 79). In ﬁgure the thick and the thin
solid lines correspond to relativistic and non-relativistic curves obtained in framework
of delta-approximation. The results of relativistic calculations in plane-wave Born and
Born-Elwert approximations are plotted by short-dashed and long-dashed lines.

Figure 5. Comparison of the results of relativistic delta-approximation with the exact
non-relativistic calculations with accounting for radiation retardation [4] of 2BrS cross
section Z −2 d4σω1 ω2(Ω1, Ω2) formed during electron collision with Ag atom (Z = 47).
Three sets of curves correspond to diﬀerent emission geometries : solid lines are used
for θ1 = θ2 = 30o case, long-dashed — for θ1 = θ2 = 45o case and short-dashed — for
θ1 = θ2 = 90o case. Non-relativistic results for each of these emission geometries are
given by triangles, squares and circles respectively.

Figure 6. Comparison of the results of relativistic delta-approximation with the
exact non-relativistic calculations with accounting for radiation retardation [27] of
2BrS cross section Z −2 d4σω1 ω2(Ω1, Ω2) as function of energy of second emitted photon
ω2. Presented four graphs correspond to collision of 10 keV electron with four
diﬀerent atomic targets with Z = 1, 13, 47, 79. The energy of the ﬁrst emitted photon
ω1 = 1 keV and emission geometry θ1 = θ2 = 45o, ϕ1
ϕ2 = 180o are the same for
all graphs. Results of relativistic delta-approximation are given by thick solid line.
For results of non-relativistic exact calculations the thin solid line is used. Relativistic
plane-wave Born curves are plotted by dashed line.

Abstract

Using the orbitals generated by the van Leeuwen-Baerends potential [Phys.

Rev. A 49, 2421 (1994)], we calculate frequency-dependent response proper-

ties of the noble gas atoms of helium, neon and argon and the alkaline earth

atoms of berrylium and magnisium, with particular emphasis on their non-

linear polarizabilities. For this, we employ the time-dependent Kohn-Sham

formalism with the adiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA) for the ex-

change and correlation. We show that the results thus obtained for frequency-

dependent polarizabilities (both linear and nonlinear) of the inert gas atoms

are highly accurate. On the other hand, polarizabilities of the alkaline earths

are not given with the same degeree of accuracy. In light of this, we make an

assessment of ALDA for obtaining linear and nonlinear response properties

by employing time-dependent density-functional theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, the time dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) [1,2] is be-

ing used increasingly to study frequency dependent response properties [3–14] and excitation

energies [2,11,15] of many-electron systems. The theory found its ﬁrst application in the cal-

culation of frequency dependent polarizabilities of atoms and photo-absorption cross section

of atoms and molecules [3,4]. However, the existence of TDDFT was not formally proved

at that time. It was some years later that Deb and Ghosh [16], Bartolotti [17] and Runge

and Gross [18] laid rigorous foundations of TDDFT. Analogous to its stationary counter-

part TDDFT is exact in principle but its practical implementation requires approximating

the exchange-correlation (XC) energy functional. In most of the applications the adiabatic

local density approximation (ALDA) [1] is used. In this approximation the nonlocal time-

dependence of the functional is ignored and the spatial dependence is also treated locally.

As such the functional has the same form as the local-density approximation (LDA) of the

stationary-state theory [19,20]. Results for the response properties using the LDA for the

unperturbed system and ALDA for perturbation calculations show that with these approx-

imations the polarizability at zero frequency (static polarizability) as well as its frequency

dependence are overestimated. Use of LDA+ALDA for the response property calculations

introduces errors at two diﬀerent levels. First, the use of the LDA for calculation of the

unperturbed orbitals gives potentials and densities which are asymptotically not correct. In

particular the tail of the LDA potential is exponential rather than its correct − 1

r behaviour

[21]. Thus the physical propreties that depend on the asymptotic nature of the ground-state

orbitals and densities, for example the response properties, are not determined accurately

by the LDA orbitals. Secondly, errors in the response property calculations arise beacause:

(i) further change in the potential itself is being calculated approximately, and (ii) ALDA is

valid only in the limit of zero frequency. There have been attempts to rectify the problem at

the ﬁrst level by employing methods which reproduce the asymptotic behaviour of the po-

tential correctly. Thus Senatore and Subbaswamy [7] applied the self-interaction correction

2

[22] method to obtain accurate orbitals with proper asymptotic decay. Later Zong et. al [8]

devised a scissors operator technique and Gisbergen et al. [9] employed a model potential

with the desired asymptotic behaviour to improve the polarizabilities. Gisbergen et al. [11]

also studied frequency dependent polarizabilities of He, Be and Ne by employing exact XC

potential for the ground-state of these atoms coupled with ALDA for the XC kernels. Nearly

exact ground-state wavefunction along with the ALDA for XC kernels were employed by us

[13] to calculate nonlinear optical coeﬃcients of helium, and to investigate the accuracy of

ALDA in predicting the frequency dependence of nonlinear polarizabilities.

All these studies show that the inaccuracy in the response properties arise mainly from

the use of the LDA to obtain the unperturbed densities; For perturbative calculations, on

the other hand, ALDA appears to be a reasonably accurate approximation, particularly at

frequencies in the optical range. One may therefore conclude that if the asymptotic nature

of the potential is corrected, the response properties at optical frequencies will come out to

be copmparable to the ab-initio or experimental values even with the use of ALDA. However,

the conclusions above cannot said to be general since most of the studies have been conﬁned

to investigating the linear polarizabilities.

Against this background it then becomes necessary to investigate how does ALDA per-

form in the calculation of frequency dependent nonlinear optical coeﬃcients of heavier atoms

when asymptotically accurate ground-state orbitals are used for this purpose. For the helium

atom we could perform such a study with a near exact ground-state orbital [23] obtained

from its Hylleraas wavefunction. However, this is not possible for systems with larger num-

ber of electrons. For such systems we generate the ground-state orbitals and potentials by

using the model potential introduced by van Leeuwen and Baerends (LB) [24] as a cor-

rection to the LDA XC potential. Recently we have employed this potential to calculate

the static nonlinear response properties of several atoms and ions [25]. We found that the

orbitals given by this model potential, when used with the LDA for the higher derivatives of

XC potential, give reasonably accurate static hyperpolarizabilities for the inert gas atoms.

Thus to assess the accuracy of ALDA in predicting the frequency dependence of nonlinear

3

polarizabilities, in this paper we ﬁrst study dynamic hyperpolarizabilities of these atoms

calculated by employing the orbitals generated by the LB potential. In our study [13] of the

static properties, we also found that the hyperpolarizabilities for the alkaline earths show

some improvement with the inclusion of the LB correction although their linear polarizabil-

ities remain unaﬀected. In this paper we study the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of

the alkaline earth atoms of Be and Mg also and show that the dynamic polarizabilities of

these systems follow the same trend as their static counterparts. In the following, we ﬁrst

brieﬂy describe the LB potential. We follow that with a short description of the variation-

perturbation method of calculating the dynamic response properties. We then present our

results and conclude the paper with a discussion.

van Leeuwen and Baerends [24] proposed a correction to the LDA potential primarily to

correct its asymptotic behaviour. For this they ﬁrst noted that the Becke’s correction [26] to

the LDA functional gives the correct exchange-energy density but fails to give the potential

correctly. Thus they suggested that a Becke-like correction be added to the potential directly,

and found that such a correction brings the approximate potential very close to the exact

one. Thus the highest occupied orbital eigenenergy as obtained from this potential is close

to the ionization energy of a many-electron system. More recently, it has been shown that

the corresponding total energy is also quite accurate [25] . The eﬀective potential proposed

by LB has the form

with

vxc(r) = vLDA

and β = 0.05. Note that the extra term vLB(r) added to the LDA potential

is like the Becke term. It therefore represents the correction to only the exchange component

of the potential. Using the potential given by Eq.(1) and (2) we generate the ground-state

orbitals and potentials for the above mentioned atoms and then employ these orbitals for

the calculation of frequency dependent linear and nonlinear polarizabilities.

4

We perform calculations of the optical response properties by employing the variation-

perturbation method [10] within the time dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) formalism of

TDDFT. This method has been used in the past to calculate [13] polarizabilities corre-

ponding to several nonlinear optical phenomena. The method and expressions for various

hyperpolarizabilities have been discussed [10,13] in our earlier works. Thus we do not de-

scribe these in detail here. It is suﬃcient to mention that the linear polarizability and the

coeﬃcient corresponding to the degenerate-four-wave-mixing (DFWM) are obtained directly

by minimizing the second-order and fourth-order changes in the quasi-energy with respect

to the ﬁrst and second-order orbitals, respectively. The other nonlinear coeﬃcients are not

related directly with the fourth-order energy change. However, expressions for these coeﬃ-

cients in terms of second-order orbitals have been derived [13,27] within TDKS theory and

it is these expressions which we employ here. To perform our calculations, we represent the

radial part of the induced orbitals by a linear combination of the Slater type orbitals (STO).

Thus it is given as

f (r) = X
i

Cirnie−ηir,

(3)

where ni and ηi are the parameters of STO which are ﬁxed and Ci are the linear vari-

ational parameters. Parameters ni and ηi are chosen in such a way that the functions

correctly represent the excited states. We have optimized these parameters by calculat-

ing the static poalrizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities from the LDA ground-state orbitals,

and matching the results with the numbers obtained by Stott and Zaremba [4]. For the

exchange-correlation energy we have used the Gunnarsson-Lundquist parametrization [28],

which is the same as used by Stott and Zaremba. Thus our results for hyperpolarizabilities

are around 10% less than those of Senatore and Subbaswamy [7] who use the Perdew-Zunger

[22] parametrization.

We now present the results of our calculation. Although our main focus in this paper

is on the frequency dependent hyperpolarizabilities, for completeness we ﬁrst discuss the

results for frequency dependent polarizabilities.

5

In Figs.1-3 we show the ratio α(ω)

α(0) for the inert gas atoms He, Ne and Ar as a function of

frequency ω and for comparison also display the corresponding ab-initio results. For helium

we compare our results with the results of Bishop and Lam [29] and for neon and argon the

comparison is made with the MP2 results of Rice [30]. Since α(0) is already reproduced

[25] quite accurately with the LB orbitals, it is clear from these ﬁgures that α(ω) is also

accurate and matches quite well with the ab-initio results. For helium the ab-initio results

are essentially reproduced by our calculations for frequencies up to 0.5 a.u. (wavelength of

about 914 ˚A). For neon the match with the MP2 results is good till about 0.1 a.u. and

for argon good match is obtained up to ω = 0.07 a.u.. For comparison we also show the

corresponding LDA results.

It is quite clear that the LDA results are highly inﬂated in

comparison to both the LB corrected and the ab-initio numbers.

In Figs. 4 and 5, we present the results of α(ω)

α(0) for the Be and Mg atoms. The results

for these atoms are quite diﬀerent from those of the inert gas atoms discussed above. Here

the LDA and the LB corrected results are essentially the same. This is intriguing since

the energies and the highest occupied eigenvalues obtained from the two schemes diﬀer

signiﬁcantly. A possible reason for this could be that since the outer electrons in these

systems are less tightly bound, the exchange and correlation eﬀects play a relatively more

important role in determining the polarizabilities, and ALDA is not suﬃcient to represent

their eﬀects accurately. Thus although the unperturbed orbitals are improved by inclusion

of the LB correction, this alone is not suﬃcient to get over the inaccuracy of ALDA for these

systems.

Having discussed linear polarizabilities, we now proceed on to present the results for

the nonlinear coeﬃcients corresponding to third harmonic generation (THG) and DFWM

of these atoms. As is the case with polarizabilities, these results are also obtained from the

orbitals generated by the LB potential with the use of ALDA for perturbative calculations.

First, we discuss the results for helium. Exact results corresponding to the above men-

tioned nonlinear optical eﬀects for helium are available over a range of frequencies. In Figs.

6

6 and 7 we display our results in comparison with the ab-initio results [31]. Plotted in Fig.

6 is the DFWM coeﬃcient γ(ω)

γ(0) , and in Fig. 7 we plot the THG coeﬃcient γ(3ω)

γ(0) as a function

of ω. It is evident from the ﬁgures that the results for hyperpolarizabilities obtained from

the LB orbitals are also highly accurate. The LDA, on the other hand, overestimates the

frequency dependence of these quantities by a large amount. A comparative study like this

is not possible at all frequencies for neon and argon because of the lack of available data.

However, some experimental results are available [32,33] at few discrete frequencies for all

three atoms. We now compare our results with these experimental numbers.

In Table I we present our results for the THG coeﬃcients of the atoms considered in this

paper at two distinct wavelengths, namely, λ = 10550˚A (ω ≈ 0.0433 a.u.) and λ = 6943˚A

(ω ≈ 0.0658 a.u.). We do so because experimental results for THG by helium, neon and

argon exist at these wavelengths. For a complete picture, we give the results obtained from

both the LDA and the LB orbitals. It is again clear that although the LDA orbitals give a

large error in the estimates of these quantities for the noble gas atoms, the LB corrections

to the LDA eliminates almost all of this error. Further, the numbers obtained from the

LB orbitals lie within the experimental error bounds. For the other two atoms also the LB

corrected results for the THG coeﬃcients are less than the LDA numbers. However, there

are no experimental numbers available for these systems. Nonetheless, on the basis of their

zero frequency results, we expect the LB numbers to be closer to experiments than the LDA

numbers. In Table II we present the results of DFWM coeeﬁcients at the same frequencies,

although no experimental data exists for this eﬀect. However, we expect these results to

be quite accurate for the noble gas atoms, and moderately accurate for the alkaline earths.

This is because the maximum deviation from the ab-initio or the experimental results is

observed for THG coeﬃcients which have already been shown to be accurate.

To conclude, our study above indicates that when accurate orbitals are employed to

calculate response properties, ALDA reproduces the frequency dependence of linear as well

as nonlinear response properties of the noble gas atoms quite accurately. On the other hand,

for the alkaline earths its behaviour with respect to the linear and nonlinear polarizabilities

7

is quite diﬀerent. Thus it appears that for systems, such as Be and Mg, where the electrons

are loosely bound, ALDA is not a good approximation to calculate the eﬀects of exchange

and correlation. In a recent study, it has been shown that ALDA is a major component

[34]of the exchange-correlation functional for time-dependent hamiltonians. This has been

done by considering two electrons moving in a time-dependent potential. However, our study

indicates that this is true only if the electrons are tightly bound.

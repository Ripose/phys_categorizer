Abstract

Ultracold neutral plasmas, formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near the
ionization threshold, have electron temperatures in the 1-1000 kelvin range and ion
temperatures from tens of millikelvin to a few kelvin. They represent a new frontier
in the study of neutral plasmas, which traditionally deals with much hotter systems,
but they also blur the boundaries of plasma, atomic, condensed matter, and low
temperature physics. Modelling these plasmas challenges computational techniques
and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so the ﬁeld has attracted great interest from
the theoretical and computational physics communities. By varying laser intensities
and wavelengths it is possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy,
and charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements
for comparison with theoretical predictions.

Recent experiments using optical probes demonstrated that ions in the plasma
equilibrate in a strongly coupled ﬂuid phase. Strongly coupled plasmas, in which the
electrical interaction energy between charged particles exceeds the average kinetic
energy, reverse the traditional energy hierarchy underlying basic plasma concepts
such as Debye screening and hydrodynamics. Equilibration in this regime is of par-
ticular interest because it involves the establishment of spatial correlations between
particles, and it connects to the physics of the interiors of gas-giant planets and
inertial conﬁnement fusion devices.

1 Introduction

In a conventional neutral plasma, ions and electrons are created from atoms
and molecules by ionizing collisions between particles. Because a typical ion-
ization potential is on the order of an electronvolt, most neutral plasmas have
temperatures of thousands of kelvin or more. (See Fig. 1.) Plasma physics
in this regime encompasses a wealth of fascinating fundamental phenomena
such as collective modes, instabilities, and transport mechanisms, and it can
contribute to important applications such as lighting technologies, plasma pro-
cessing, and the pursuit of fusion energy.

Ultracold neutral plasmas [2] stretch the boundaries of traditional neutral
plasma physics. They are formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near
the ionization threshold and have electron temperatures ranging from 1-1000 K
and ion temperatures of around 1 K. While providing access to a new regime,
they have also proven to be clean and simple systems that form an excellent
testing ground for basic plasma theory, and they elucidate physics found across
a much wider spectrum of plasma energy and density.

The clearest distinguishing feature of ultracold neutral plasmas is that par-
ticles can be in or near the strongly coupled regime [3]. In strongly coupled
plasmas the Coulomb interaction energy between charged particles exceeds the
average kinetic energy, which is quantiﬁed by the Coulomb coupling parameter

Γ = e2/[4πε0akBT ],

where a = [3/(4πρ)]1/3 is the Wigner-Seitz radius characterizing the separa-
tion between particles in a plasma of density ρ and temperature T . Γ > 1
reverses the traditional energy hierarchy that underlies our normal under-
standing of plasmas based on concepts such as Debye screening and hydro-
dynamics. Strongly coupled plasmas exist in dense astrophysical systems [4],
matter irradiated with intense laser ﬁelds [5,6,7,8], colloidal or dusty plas-
mas of highly charged macroscopic particles [9,10], and non-neutral trapped
ion plasmas that are laser cooled until they freeze into Wigner crystals [11].
Strong coupling is manifested through the presence of spatial correlations be-
tween particles, which can be important for the equilibration and collective
dynamics of the system. Optical probes [12,13] demonstrated that ions in an
ultracold neutral plasma can be strongly coupled. Electrons seem to remain
just outside of this regime because the rate of recombination of electrons and
ions to form neutral particles diverges rapidly as the electron temperature
drops.

There is great similarity between the dynamics of ultracold neutral plasmas
and equilibration of plasmas created by fast-pulse laser irradiation of solid
[14,15] and thin ﬁlm targets [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24], rare gas clusters [25],

and gas jets [26,27]. However, the fast-pulse systems have densities close to
or higher than the condensed phase. This complicates observation of plasma
dynamics, which takes place on the scale of the inverse plasma frequency,
ω−1
p = [mε0/(e2ρ)]1/2, and is of the order of attoseconds for electron and fem-
toseconds for ions. Ultracold plasmas, on the other hand, reach the strong
coupling regime despite the fact that they are extremely dilute (Fig. 1). The
low density implies that ultracold plasmas evolve on a time scale that is more

easily accessible experimentally. Studies of ion equilibration have revealed os-
cillations of the ion kinetic energy [28,29,30,31] that are a fundamental char-
acteristic of equilibration of strongly coupled systems. Expansion of a plasma
into the surrounding vacuum may be directly observed with excellent spatial
and temporal resolution in ultracold systems [32,33,34,13]. This phenomenon is
important in fast-pulse experiments, especially in the context of the generation
of high energy particles [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27], inertial-
conﬁnement fusion experiments [35], and x-ray lasers [36].

High energy-density and strongly coupled plasmas are often diﬃcult to de-
scribe theoretically because of the importance of many-body interactions, and
these problems are often best addressed with computational techniques. Many
body interactions are also important in ultracold neutral plasmas, and compu-
tational physicists have made signiﬁcant contributions to the understanding
of these system by applying techniques usually used for high energy-density
systems [37,38]. Ultracold plasmas have motivated the development and ap-
plication of specially adapted numerical techniques to describe the presence
of spatial correlations between the ions [39] and the evolution of electrons
and ions on very diﬀerent timescales [37]. Using these techniques it has even
been possible to lead the experimental eﬀorts by predicting the possibility of
Wigner crystallization in an ultracold expanding neutral plasma [34] and the
conditions that lead to it. Again, the excellent experimental control and di-
agnostics available imply that these computational results can be tested with
great precision in ultracold systems.

Immediately after the creation of an ultracold neutral plasma through pho-
toionization, the system is far from equilibrium, and most research in the
ﬁeld has focused on the equilibration process. Theoretical and computational
work [33,37,38,40,41,42,43] has identiﬁed processes that heat the plasma. For
plasmas in or near the strongly coupled regime, where the potential energy is
comparable to or exceeds the thermal energy, excess potential energy arising
from a random distribution of ions [40] or electrons [41] is converted to ther-
mal energy. This is called disorder-induced heating. Another important heating
mechanism is three-body recombination (TBR), in which an ion and two elec-
trons collide to form an energetic electron and an excited neutral atom. The
TBR rate varies with temperature as T −9/2 [44], and at low temperatures it
can become the fastest process in the plasma. TBR is a crucial process for
the formation of cold antihydrogen through positron-antiproton recombina-
tion [45,46]. Conditions in these anti-matter plasmas are similar to ultracold
neutral plasmas except a large magnetic ﬁeld is usually present to contain the
particles. Surprisingly, recombination in ultracold neutral plasmas also has
similarities to stellar dynamics in globular clusters [47].

The study of collective modes has proven to be a rich area of research, orig-
inally motivated by the possibility of observing modiﬁcation of the mode

Tonks-Dattner modes [50] have served as probes of plasma dynamics and rep-
resent interesting fundamental problems in their own right.

The review is structured such that Sections 2 and 3 provide the experimental
and theoretical basis that allows one to understand and manipulate ultracold
neutral plasmas. Section 4 of the review describes the physical processes which
take place in an ultracold neutral plasma from the time it is created until it
expands into the surrounding vacuum. In Section 5, we discuss proposals and
prospects for achieving very strong coupling of the plasma – in some sense
the “holy grail” of ultracold plasma physics. We conclude with Section 6 by
discussing some possible future directions of this relatively young research
ﬁeld.

2 Experimental Methods

2.1 Creation of ultracold neutral plasmas

The production of an ultracold neutral plasma starts with laser-cooled and
trapped neutral atoms. There are many good resources on this topic, such as
the book “Laser Cooling and Trapping,” by Metcalf and van der Straten [52].
In a conﬁguration of laser beams and magnetic ﬁelds known as a magneto-
optical trap (Fig. 2), as many as 109 atoms can be cooled to millikelvin or even
microkelvin temperatures, and conﬁned at densities approaching 1011 cm−3.

decay to the 2D3/2 state 7% of the time, after which they cease to interact with the
imaging beam. This does not aﬀect most experiments because ions typically scatter
fewer than one photon while the imaging beam is on. The level scheme is similar
for calcium [13].

1500 µm. The ﬁrst ultracold plasma experiments
with a width of σ = 200
were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Gaithersburg (NIST) with metastable xenon [53], but any atom that can be
laser cooled and photoionized may be used, such as strontium [51,54], calcium
[13], rubidium [55,56], and cesium [56]. A plasma has also been produced by
photoionizing a Bose-Einstein condensate [57].

A pulsed dye laser excites the laser-cooled atoms above the ionization thresh-
old (Fig. 3A). Because of their light mass, the electrons have an initial kinetic
energy (Ee) approximately equal to the diﬀerence between the photon energy
and the ionization potential. Ee/kB can be as low as the bandwidth of the
100 mK with standard pulsed dye lasers, but most
ionizing laser, which is
studies so far have dealt with Ee/kB between 1 and 1000 K. The initial kinetic
energy for the ions is in the millikelvin range. The number of atoms ionized
(Ni), and thus the density of the plasma (ρ), is controlled by varying the
energy of the photoionizing laser pulse.

but Fig. 4 illustrates how the evolution can be divided into three phases. The
fastest process is the equilibration of the electrons because they are relatively
energetic and light. The more sluggish ions then equilibrate with themselves
on a slightly longer timescale. And ﬁnally, the plasma – which is unconﬁned
in typical experiments – expands into the surrounding vacuum.

2.1.1 Photoionization

The photoionization process is crucial in these experiments, and the book
“Rydberg Atoms” [58] by T. Gallagher provides an excellent introduction
to this subject. Most ultracold plasma experiments have used two-photon
ionization, in which one photon from the continuous-wave (CW) cooling laser
excites atoms to the upper level of the cooling transition, and a pulsed laser
then excites them to the continuum. (See Fig. 3.)

In equilibrium the fraction of atoms in the upper state of the cooling transition
can approach 50%, and is given by [52]

f =

s0/2
1 + s0 + (2δ/γ)2 ,

(3)

where δ is the detuning from resonance of the CW laser, γ is the full linewidth
at half maximum for the transition, and s0 = I/Isat is the saturation parameter
for the excitation beam of intensity I. Isat is typically a few mW/cm2, and
it is the intensity required to drive the transition at a rate equal to γ. The
excited-state fraction during normal MOT operation is typically about 10%,

Photoionization from the intermediate state is best described in terms of a
cross section for absorption of ionizing photons, σPI. Cross sections near the

Cross sections are normally constant over the near-threshold-ionization region
of interest for ultracold plasmas, unless there is some physics feature that mod-
iﬁes them, such as an autoionizing resonance, which is the case in strontium
[59]. In alkali metals except lithium, cross sections for single-photon excita-
tion from the S ground state to near the ionization threshold show Cooper
minima [58]. This is one reason why most ultracold plasma experiments use
two-photon excitation.

The ionization process adds momentum and energy to the electrons and ions.
The particles can be treated as at rest initially, and recoil during excitation to
the intermediate state is negligible. Momentum and energy conservation for
the pulsed laser photons of frequency ν gives

2.1.2 Spontaneous ionization of a dense Rydberg gas

An ultracold neutral plasma also forms from spontaneous ionization in a dense
cloud of ultracold Rydberg atoms. In fact, the ﬁrst experiments focused on this
phenomenon [61], and the hope was to observe a gas-phase analog of the Mott
insulator-to-conductor transition familiar from condensed matter physics [62].
The idea was ﬁrst explored by Haroche and co-workers [63] when they saw
spontaneous ionization in a beam of Rydberg atoms.

In experiments performed so far, collisions, as opposed to a phase transition,
drive the spontaneous ionization process in beams or laser-cooled clouds, and
after the formation of the plasma, the dynamics is very similar to the evolu-
tion of a system created by direct photoionization [33]. We will touch upon
this work brieﬂy in Sec. 4.1.2. However, it will not be the main focus of this
review, and for a deeper discussion we refer to papers exploring the sponta-
neous evolution of Rydberg atoms into a plasma [64] and dynamics of Rydberg
atoms embedded in an ultracold plasma [55]. Related questions regarding the
stability of a Rydberg gas are important for fundamental interest and also
because this is a proposed architecture for quantum computing [65].

2.2 Detection of ultracold neutral plasmas

2.2.1 Charged particle detection

The most common diagnostics for studying ultracold plasmas is detection of
charged particles after they have left the plasma. The basic idea is shown in
Fig. 5. The initial experiments at NIST on plasmas produced by direct pho-
toionization [2,32,66,67] detected electrons. Experiments exploring the spon-
taneous evolution of Rydberg atoms into a plasma [64] and dynamics of Ryd-
berg atoms embedded in an ultracold plasma [55,68] have used both ion and
electron detection.

For monitoring electrons that escape the plasma during normal evolution, it
is essential to not perturb the plasma with large electric ﬁelds. However, one
needs a ﬁeld of about 5 mV/cm to guide the escaping charged particles to the
detector. This produces a time-of-ﬂight delay for electrons until they reach
the detector of about 1 µs. Since electrons move away from the plasma in
all directions, it also means that the detection eﬃciency is not 100%. easily

Coulomb well formed by the ions, electric ﬁelds created by potentials on wire-mesh
grids direct them to an electron multiplier or microchannel plate. By reversing the

radio frequency ﬁelds to excite plasma collective modes.

of a given sign on the detector. With careful design, values well in excess of
100 V/cm can be obtained, which are also useful for pulsed ﬁeld ionization of
Rydberg atoms [58].

2.2.2 Optical probes

Probing an ultracold plasma through charged particles has some limitations.
For example, remote detection of particles tends to only provide information
on average properties of the plasma, and cannot resolve variations, such as
ion acoustic waves or ion-ion spatial correlations. The time resolution is also
limited by the time of ﬂight for electrons to reach the detector.

For detecting electrons, there are currently no options besides charged parti-
cle diagnostics. For probing ions, however, optical methods oﬀer a powerful
alternative that can provide in situ, non-destructive measurements, with ex-
cellent spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Absorption imaging [12] has
been used to probe ion-ion equilibration and expansion of the plasma during
the ﬁrst few microseconds after photoionization. Fluorescence monitoring has
given information on the plasma expansion dynamics [13] from shortly after
photoionization to 50 µs later. Both techniques have great potential to study
phenomena such as ion collective modes [69], shock waves [33], recombination,
and particle-particle spatial correlations [11].

Absorption imaging is an adaptation of one of the most powerful techniques
for studying laser cooled and trapped neutral atoms [52]. Implementation of
this probe to study ultracold plasmas requires much higher temporal resolu-
tion than typically needed for neutral atom experiments because the plasma
evolves quickly - in as short as nanoseconds in some cases. It is also essential

to perform experiments with an ion whose ground state possesses electric-
dipole allowed transitions in the optical regime where cameras and lasers are
available. Alkaline-earth elements possess this property, which is why they are
used in quantum computing and optical frequency standard experiments us-
ing trapped ions. Strontium is a good choice for plasma experiments because
its laser cooling is well-developed [51] and imaging can be performed using
2P1/2 transition at 422 nm (Fig. 3B). Calcium is also a good
the Sr+ 2S1/2 →
choice because it has a similar level structure [13,70].

To record an absorption image of the plasma, a collimated laser beam, tuned
near resonance with the principal transition in the ions (Fig. 3B), illuminates
the plasma and falls on an image–intensiﬁed CCD camera. Ions scatter photons
out of the laser beam and create a shadow that is recorded by the camera.
The optical depth (OD) is deﬁned in terms of the image intensity without the
plasma (I0) and with the plasma present (I) as

OD(x, y) = ln [I0(x, y)/I(x, y)] .

(8)

Figure 6 shows a typical absorption image. By varying the delay ∆t between
the formation of the plasma and image exposure, the time-evolution of the
plasma can be studied. The minimum camera exposure gate width for standard
intensiﬁed CCD cameras is

10 ns.

∼

Valuable information is provided by the absorption spectrum, which can be
recorded by varying the frequency of the probe beam ν [12]. For an average
spectrum of the entire plasma, the optical depth is integrated over the plane
perpendicular to the laser,

In reality the camera pixels are summed, and typical averaged absorption
spectra are shown in Fig. 7.

In order to quantitatively interpret the spectra, it is important to account
for the inhomogeneous density distribution of the plasma and other eﬀects
that will be discussed in subsequent sections. Among them are thermal ion
motion, plasma expansion, and the lack of global thermal equilibrium for the
ions. Detailed descriptions of the spectral analysis were given in [54] and [71].
Further aspects are also discussed in App. B. The OD can be related to
underlying physical parameters according to Beer’s law,

OD(x, y) =

dz ρi(x, y, z)α[ν, Ti(r)],

Z

where ρi(x, y, z) is the ion density, and α[ν, Ti(r)] is the ion absorption cross
section at the image beam frequency, ν. The absorption cross section is a
function of ion kinetic energy, or temperature, due to Doppler broadening.
The ion temperature varies with density, so for a spherically symmetric but
inhomogenous plasma (e.g., for a gaussian plasma cloud as in Eq. (2)) Ti =
Ti(r) and therefore α varies with position. Equation (10) can be used to relate
the spectrum to the density weighted average of the absorption cross section

The absorption cross section α[ν, Ti(r)] for ions whose motion can be described
by a temperature Ti is given by the Voigt proﬁle (see appendix B, Eq. (B.1)).
When this expression, generalized to include the eﬀect of the plasma expansion
(Eq. (B.3)) is substituted into the expression for the spectrum (Eq. (11)), the
result is reasonably complicated. However, to a good approximation [54,71],
the density-averaged spectrum can be ﬁt by a single Voigt proﬁle character-
ized by an eﬀective ion temperature (Ti,eﬀ) that describes all the Doppler
broadening due to ion motion (For the derivation, see appendix B),

ν0 = c/λ, and the “three-star” symbol [72] is a numerical factor that accounts
for the polarization state of the ions and the imaging light.

With reasonable assumptions valid for a wide range of plasma parameters,
Ti,eﬀ can be related to the average ion temperature in the plasma, Ti,ave =
d3r Ti(r), but the relation varies as the plasma evolves. During the ﬁrst
microsecond after photoionization and while disorder-induced heating (Sec.
R
4.2.1) takes place, the plasma is not in local thermal equilibrium (LTE). (See
Section 4.2.) Strictly speaking, ion temperature is not a well deﬁned concept
at in this situation. However, Ti,eﬀ can always be related to the average ion
kinetic energy and the rms ion velocity along the laser beam through kBTi,eﬀ =

Once LTE is established, it is possible to assign an ion temperature reﬂecting
thermal motion, Ti(r), but it varies with position because the plasma lacks
global thermal equilibrium [73,71]. The approach to global thermal equilibrium
is governed by a heat diﬀusion equation. This leads to a equilibration time

This depends on the plasma density through the Wigner-Seitz radius and the
ion plasma oscillation frequency. τglobal is typically greater than 100 µs, which
is longer than experiments or simulations have probed.

the characteristic time scale of plasma expansion which emerges from the

At later times, the expansion is not negligible. But for a broad range of plasma
initial conditions, the expansion is quite simple and can be described by as-
suming quasi-neutrality and a self-similar expansion of the plasma (Section

Regardless of the exact spatial dependence of Ti(r), the integral of the spec-

If Eq. (9) is modiﬁed so that the OD is integrated over a subsection of the
plasma image, then Ti,eﬀ describes ion motion in the region bounded by the
integration limits and extending along the propagation direction of the imaging
laser. The integral over the spectrum is then proportional to the number of
ions in that region. Analysis of spectra in annular regions was described in
[28,71] and proved very useful for studying kinetic energy oscillations (Section
4.2).

In ﬂuorescence experiments, which have been performed with calcium [13,70],
ﬂuorescence from a cylindrical region formed by the intersection of the plasma
with a tightly focused laser beam is collected on a photomultiplier tube. (See
Fig. 8.) This approach has the advantage of recording the full time evolution
of the system with each photoionizing pulse, but repeated scans must be taken
with the laser at diﬀerent positions in order to map the spatial distribution.

3 Theoretical Description

In the last decades, a variety of methods have been developed to describe equi-
librium states [75,76,77,78,79], relaxation processes [80,81], transport proper-
ties [82,83], and atomic processes [84,85,86,87] of plasmas. These methods

16

cover a wide parameter space, ranging from cold, low-density plasmas in gas-
discharges to warm dense matter systems. A typical ultracold plasma behaves
classically, which facilitates its description. Indeed, the low particle density in
an ultracold plasma implies a Br¨uckner parameter rs = (3/4πρe)1/3/a0 ≫
1
kBTe. Hence, the values of both of these
and an electronic Fermi energy EF ≪
parameters justify a classical treatment of the free charges. Moreover, due to
the low electron temperatures, recombination forms atoms in highly excited
states, such that electron-atom collisions [44] and radiative transitions [88]
can be described classically as well. One might be tempted to conclude that
a macroscopic treatment based on kinetic theory incorporating some collision
phenomena may suﬃce to describe ultracold plasmas.

However, as it has turned out this is not true. Even a classical description
of ultracold neutral plasmas is far from trivial and poses several challenges.
First of all (and this is of course one reason why ultracold plasmas are attrac-
tive) the ionic plasma component may be strongly coupled, rendering common
kinetic theories for weakly coupled plasmas inapplicable. Strongly coupled
problems are usually tackled numerically with a molecular-dynamics (MD)
approach. Due to the open boundary conditions and long evolution times of
ultracold plasmas, however, a full MD description of the plasma dynamics
constitutes an intractable computational task currently. Moreover, the highly
non-equilibrium plasma dynamics exhibits diﬀerent relaxation processes on
very diﬀerent time scales, which all have to be appropriately taken into ac-
count for a reliable and realistic understanding of an ultracold plasma.

Hence, one may ask if it is possible at all to describe ultracold plasmas on
a macroscopic level based on kinetic and hydrodynamic formulations. This is
indeed possible to some extent, as we will detail in Section 3.1. Starting from
a collisionless description of the plasma, additional eﬀects such as inelastic
collisions and strong ion correlations are successively incorporated into the
model. More sophisticated, but also technically more demanding, approaches,
which describe the plasma dynamics on a microscopic level, are introduced
in Section 3.2. They can be used and are necessary to assess the validity and
limitations of the macroscopic descriptions.

3.1 Macroscopic Approaches

3.1.1 Collisionless plasma dynamics

If we assume the Coulomb coupling parameter of both the electrons and the
ions to be much less than unity and neglect any collisional processes in the
plasma, the dynamical equations describing the one-particle phase space den-

fαdvα. As a paradigmatic problem of plasma physics, the colli-
with ρα =
sionless plasma expansion into vacuum has been considered for a long time
[90,91] and solutions of Eqs. (18) have been investigated in a number of recent
publications [92,93]. Ultracold plasmas for the ﬁrst time allow for a combined
theoretical and experimental study of this problem. Clearly, for the present
situation of potentially strongly coupled plasmas, the Vlasov equations alone
will not suﬃce. But they will serve as the basis of our hydrodynamic approach.
A suitable approximate treatment of correlation eﬀects will subsequently be
added step by step, to clarify the inﬂuence of correlations on the expansion
dynamics.

Due to its nonlinearity a general, closed-form analytical solution of Eqs. (18)
cannot be given. Here we will employ the additional assumption of quasineu-
trality [91], under which a large set of self-similar solutions exists. Of particular
interest in the context of ultracold plasmas is the case of a Gaussian phase
space density (see Eq.(22)), discussed in [92], since this is the typical initial
shape of the plasma created in a magneto-optical trap. For a spherically sym-
metric plasma it describes a local equilibrium in velocity space, which holds for
arbitrarily long times of the plasma evolution. We will use a further approxi-
mation, enforcing a local equilibrium for the electrons (see Eq.(20)), in order
to treat more general cases of strongly coupled or non-symmetric plasmas as
discussed below. Due to the very small mass ratio me/mi, the timescale for
equilibration of the electrons is much smaller than the timescale for motion
of the ions. Exploiting this fact, one may safely use an adiabatic approxima-
tion for the electrons, assuming instant equilibration, such that the electronic
phase space density is given by a quasistationary distribution

does not imply the space charge potential to be zero. Rather, it replaces the
Poisson equation (19) by Eq. (21). In appendix C we provide a more detailed
account of this fact, which may seem somewhat contradictorily and is rarely
discussed in the literature.

provides a selfsimilar solution of the ionic kinetic equation. Here the index
k = x, y, z labels the (cartesian) components, σ is the rms-radius of the Gaus-
sian spatial distribution, and γ is a parameter determining the local mean of
the velocity distribution, i.e. the hydrodynamic ion velocity. Coincidentally,
the Gaussian form (22) corresponds to the initial distribution of ions, which
reﬂects the Gaussian density proﬁle and zero mean velocity (i.e. γ = 0) of
atoms in the magneto-optical trap. Hence, within the collisionless quasineu-
tral approximation, the expanding plasma retains its shape for all times, and
its evolution can be parameterized by the macroscopic parameters σk, γk, Ti,k
and Te only.

Considering a spherically symmetric plasma of Gaussian form as in Eq. (2)

Measurements of the average density dynamics for ultracold plasmas are in
very good agreement with these simple relations for high initial electron tem-
perature (Te(0) > 70 K) [32]. However, the same experiments have revealed
signiﬁcant deviations from this average density dynamics for lower electron
temperature. As discussed in [42], they mainly arise from inelastic collisions,
i.e., from the formation of Rydberg atoms during the plasma expansion. This
is one consequence of collisions in the plasma which we will discuss next.

3.1.2 Collisional processes

There are two types of collisional processes in plasmas: elastic collisions, which
do not aﬀect the total system temperature Te + Ti, and inelastic collisions,
which may drastically change the temperature of the electrons. On the short-
est timescale of several ns, elastic electron-electron collisions lead to an equi-
libration of the electron velocities, giving rise to the electronic temperature
of the plasma. Implicitly, we have already accounted for this process in the
previous section within the adiabatic approximation Eq. (20), which assumes
an instantaneous relaxation towards a Maxwellian electron velocity distribu-
tion. This assumption is well justiﬁed since the timescale for electron-electron
collisions is by far the shortest one for a typical ultracold plasma. The ion
velocity distribution, on the other hand, has the initial Maxwellian form of

20

the atomic velocity distribution. Hence, the ion-ion collision integral vanishes
and does not change the functional velocity dependence of the ion distribution
as described by Eq. (22).

While electron-electron and ion-ion collisions lead to an individual electron
and ion temperature, respectively, electron-ion collisions tend to equilibrate
the ion and the electron temperature. However, elastic electron-ion collisions
may safely be neglected for the description of a freely expanding plasma 2 ,
since the corresponding ion heating rate [60] is much less than the rate of the
initial disorder induced ion heating to be discussed in Section 4.2.1. During
later times, the expansion leads to an adiabatic cooling of the ions, but also to
a reduction of the collisional heating rate. Hence, elastic electron-ion collisions
remain negligible at all times [94].

This is not the case, however, for inelastic electron-ion collisions due to the
low temperature of the electrons, which leads to eﬃcient recombination into
bound Rydberg states. The formation of bound states during the evolution
of the plasma can be described most accurately within a classical molecular
dynamics treatment taking into account all electron-ion interactions [37,38].
However, as discussed above, such an approach is limited to short times due
to the fact that the small timescale on which the electronic motion takes place
has to be resolved. Within the present macroscopic approach the problem
is simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly by adopting a chemical picture, i.e., by introducing
neutral atoms as an additional particle species. Naturally, this transition is ac-
complished by splitting the electron-ion two-particle distribution function fei
into a free and a bound part [84], where the bound part is identiﬁed with the
distribution function fa of the atoms. The evolution equation for the atom dis-
tribution function then involves an integral over the three-particle distribution
function describing correlations between pairs of electrons and an ion, which
accounts for inelastic collisions, i.e. recombination, ionization and electron
impact (de)-excitation. Without going into detail, the corresponding inelas-
tic processes can be identiﬁed as three-body recombination, electron-impact
ionization, and electron impact excitation or deexcitation. Consequently, the
electron-ion kinetic equation (18) splits into separate equations for free elec-
trons, ions, and atoms. Neglecting atom-atom interactions and still retaining
the Vlasov approximation, the kinetic equations for ions and atoms read

where the rate coeﬃcients Ktbr, Kion and Kbb for three-body recombination,
electron impact ionization and electron impact induced bound-bound transi-
tions depend on the atomic principal quantum numbers n and p, the electronic
density ρe, and the temperature Te. Since these coeﬃcients describe three-
body processes, no exact analytical expressions for the rates are known. For
the highly excited Rydberg states in ultracold plasmas an accurate descrip-
tion is expected from the rate coeﬃcients of [44], which have been obtained by
ﬁtting analytical functions to the results of classical trajectory Monte Carlo
calculations. Since the collision integrals Eqs. (28) and (29) introduce a non-
linearity in the spatial particle densities, an exact selfsimilar solution of the
corresponding kinetic equations can no longer be found. Nevertheless, we as-
sume the phase space distribution to be the same for atoms and for ions and
to still be given by Eq. (22), which was shown to yield a good description
of freely expanding ultracold plasmas by comparison with more sophisticated
calculations [39]. Based on this approximation and from the moments of the

As can be seen from the energy relation Eq. (31e), inelastic collisions not only
change the total number of atoms and ions, i.e., the degree of ionization of the
plasma, but also aﬀect the temperature of the electronic component. Three-
body recombination heats the electron plasma, since one electron carries away
the excess energy gained in the recombination of another electron with an ion.
Subsequent de-exciting electron-Rydberg atom collisions further heat up the
plasma, electron impact ionization and excitation tend to cool the electrons.

The total three-body recombination rate has a strong temperature dependence
. Hence, for very high initial electron tem-
and scales as
peratures inelastic collisions are of minor importance and Eqs. (31) reduce
to Eqs. (23), such that the plasma expansion is well described by the simple
relations Eqs. (24). On the other hand, at low initial Te, when the electronic
Coulomb coupling parameter approaches unity, three-body recombination and
subsequent electron-atom collisions quickly heat up the electron gas, strongly
decreasing Γe [95]. This justiﬁes our assumption of an ideal electron gas, in-
herent in the kinetic description. The ionic temperature, on the other hand,
remains practically unaﬀected by inelastic collisions. Hence, ionic correlation
eﬀects may not necessarily be negligible, and will be accounted for in the next
section.

3.1.3 Strongly coupled ions

Kinetic theories of non-ideal plasmas are commonly based on a small-Γ expan-
sion. For ultracold plasmas such approaches are clearly not applicable, since
the ion component can exhibit Coulomb coupling parameters on the order
of or even much larger than unity. Alternatively, one can combine a hydro-
dynamical treatment of the expansion dynamics with numerical results for
homogeneous strongly coupled plasmas [39]. The starting point is the kinetic
equation for the ions, which accounts exactly for ion-ion correlations,

While the description of the inﬂuence of ionic correlations on the plasma

it does not contain an equation for the time evolution of Uii. An accurate de-
scription of the evolution of Uii on a kinetic level is rather complicated, and
beyond the capabilities of the simple approach pursued here. A useful and rea-
sonable approximation for the evolution of Uii is the so-called correlation-time

Eq. (41) and Eqs. (39) constitute a closed set of equations, describing the time
evolution of a neutral plasma of electrons and ions. Compared to more involved
approaches, such as, e.g., Molecular Dynamics methods, the macroscopic evo-
lution equations are simple enough to allow for signiﬁcant physical insight
into eﬀects of ion correlation on the plasma dynamics. While Eq. (39d) shows
no direct inﬂuence on the electron temperature, the time evolution of the ion
temperature is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the interionic correlations. In addition
to the adiabatic cooling, which is given by the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side
(rhs) of (39c) in complete analogy to the electronic component, the ionic tem-
perature is increased (note that Uii < 0) by the development of correlations
(last term on the rhs of (39c)). This eﬀect, which has been named “disorder-
induced heating” or “correlation-induced heating,” has been widely studied
for homogeneous systems [80,37,41,40,103,104,73,30]. Ultracold plasmas not
only allow for experimental tests of present theories but also for studies of the
ionic correlation dynamics in expanding systems with a steadily changing local
equilibrium state, as described by the hydrodynamical evolution equations.

26

The modiﬁed time evolution of the ionic temperature leads to a modiﬁed ex-
pansion dynamics of the plasma through the change in the ionic pressure,
which contains a correlation part in addition to the thermal part. The devel-
opment of ionic correlations also reduces of the total electrostatic interaction
energy compared to a fully uncorrelated plasma. Together, these two eﬀects
result in the term Uii/3 on the rhs of (39b), which constitutes an eﬀective
negative acceleration slowing down the plasma expansion. This term can be
regarded as a time dependent “external” force, giving rise to an additional ef-
fective potential in which the ions move. This potential, however, is not static,
but changes during the expansion of the plasma, and leads (due to conserva-
tion of total energy) to an additional heating of the ions (second term on the
rhs of (39c)).

Eqs. (39a)-(39c), (31d) and (31e) form the ﬁnal set of equations for the macro-
scopic parameters of the plasma state. They are quickly and easily solved nu-
merically. Since the numerical eﬀort is independent of the number of particles
involved, the hydrodynamic approach provides a convenient method for simu-
lations of large plasma clouds over long, i.e., millisecond, timescales. It can be
used to quickly gain insight into the plasma dynamics by eﬃciently scanning a
broad range of initial-state parameters, and it is able to simulate plasmas that
are too large to be treated eﬀectively with molecular dynamics methods. More-
over, and maybe even more importantly, the kinetic model provides physical
insight by reducing the plasma dynamics to a few macroscopic parameters.
However, the accuracy of these approximate macroscopic treatments, partic-
ularly when they describe dynamics inﬂuenced by ion correlation, must be
assessed carefully. This can be done to some extent by comparison with ex-
periment, but more rigorously by developing numerically accurate microscopic
approaches relaxing most of the approximations invoked in the macroscopic
approach.

3.2 Microscopic Approaches

Microscopic approaches are by deﬁnition more accurate. They are of great
value for justifying macroscopic descriptions, and of course are the only al-
ternatives for plasma conditions that preclude macroscopic descriptions. This
refers to detailed information about the very early system evolution which is
not accessible to hydrodynamics, and the eﬀects of strong particle correlations,
which are of particular interest in the context of ultracold plasmas.

3.2.1 Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Molecular dynamics simulations of Coulomb-type interacting particles have
been employed for investigating a variety of diﬀerent problems in plasma
physics and are a corner stone of astrophysical studies of galaxy and glob-
ular clusters [105]. Conceptually, the problem seems rather simple as it only
involves the solution of a set of coupled diﬀerential equations describing the
classical motion of charged particles. However, there are several technical chal-
lenges, which in the case of ultracold neutral plasmas arise from the open
boundary of the expanding system, the attractive nature of the electron-ion
interaction and the small mass ratio of the electrons and the ions.

A general diﬃculty for simulations of neutral plasmas arises from the bound
state dynamics of atomic electrons, whose orbital timescale is many orders of
magnitude smaller than the plasma evolution time. In particular for highly
eccentric orbits conventional integrators, such as higher order Runge-Kutta
methods, do not provide a stable solution, as they lead to a signiﬁcant drift
of the total energy. More appropriate propagation schemes such as symplectic
integrators without energy drift and originally designed for the integration
of gravitational systems, have clear advantages, but also several draw-backs
and the method of choice depends on the particular problem to be studied.
For simulating ultracold plasmas higher order symplectic integrators [106],
predictor-corrector schemes [41] and timescaling methods combined with reg-
ularization procedures [107] can yield stable and reliable results.

Although a single electron and ion pair can be propagated very stably, many-
body simulations have to ﬁght additional complications. Electrons are bound
to diﬀerent ions with diﬀerent binding energies and hence their orbital times
can be very diﬀerent. Moreover, these orbital times are generally much smaller
than the timescale on which the heavier ions move. With a typical ion timescale
on the order of microseconds, one has to cover timescales from femtoseconds to
microseconds in order to describe the initial relaxation of the ionic component.
Mazevet et al. [38] and Kuzmin and O’Neil [41] have used a small ion mass and
scaled the obtained timescales to realistic experimental situations to obtain
a quantitative estimate of the experimental results. Such a scaling, however,
does not apply to all aspects of the plasma dynamics, since e.g., the timescales
for electron-ion equilibration and ion-ion equilibration scale with a diﬀerent
power of the ion mass.

Several methods to numerically tackle very diﬀerent timescales have been dis-
cussed in the literature (see, e.g., [108] and [105,109] for an overview and
further references). The common idea of such approaches is to introduce in-
dividual timesteps for the diﬀerent particles. The criteria determining the
timestep and the procedures for the synchronization of the diﬀerent particles
can however be quite diﬀerent and have to be adapted to the speciﬁc prob-

28

lem under consideration. Kuzmin and O’Neil [41,37] used a modiﬁed version
of the method originally developed by Aarseth [110] to perform a full scale
simulation of ultracold neutral plasmas with a realistic xenon ion mass and a
total number of 8192 particles.

quickly increases as N
Simulations of large, extended plasmas typically consider a smaller part of the
system and employ periodic boundary conditions to mimic the properties of
the larger system [109]. For ultracold plasmas such an approach is not very
appropriate as it neglects an important part of the dynamics – the expansion
of the plasma. The N 2-scaling of the numerical eﬀort can, however, be re-
duced by so-called hierarchical tree-methods [111] or fast multipole methods
[112], originally developed to simulate globular clusters. Such approaches still
account for the exact forces of nearby charges but approximate the force of
distant particles by the average force up to a certain multipole order of the
corresponding charge distribution. This reduces the scaling of the numerical
eﬀort with the number of particles to

N ln N or even

3.2.2 Particle-In-Cell Approaches

An alternative and conceptually diﬀerent method to reduce the numerical ef-
fort connected with the summation of the inter-particle forces is to neglect cor-
relations between the charges but retain their meanﬁeld interaction due to the
long-range part of the Coulomb potential. The so-called particle-in-cell simu-
lations (PIC) [113] have become a standard method to treat various plasma
physics problems, such as the collective dynamics of fusion devices [114,115]
or of cold plasmas in gas discharges [116,117,118], i.e., weakly coupled plas-
mas. Clearly, for ultracold neutral plasmas this method seems questionable,
as we are interested in the regime of strong coupling. However, the approach
has proven to yield a reliable and eﬃcient description of certain aspects of
the plasma dynamics as long as the plasma expansion is mainly driven by the
thermal pressure of the electrons [39].

The striking advantage of the PIC method is the possibility to treat very large
systems, by replacing a collection of real particles by a single super-particle,
with an increased charge and mass, retaining the charge-to-mass ratio of the
physical particle. A single propagation timestep of such an ensemble of super-
particles consists of the following sub-steps:

(1) At the beginning of each propagation timestep the positions of these
super-particles are used to determine the charge density of the system,

29

represented on an appropriately chosen grid. To reduce numerical noise
due the ﬁnite particle number the charges are represented by a shape
function. Most common shape functions are rectangles (particle in cell),
tent functions (cloud in cell) or Gaussians centered around the actual
particle position. Further problems arise for particle weighting in curved
coordinates, as discussed in [119].

(2) Having obtained the charge density one evaluates the corresponding static
electric ﬁeld from the Poisson equation (Eq. 19). If the system exhibits
additional spatial symmetries this is easily done by employing Gauss’
theorem. In the general case the electric mean-ﬁeld is most eﬃciently
evaluated within an FFT procedure.

(3) The calculated electric ﬁeld is subsequently transformed to the actual
particle positions taking into account the chosen shape function, which
ﬁnally allows advancement of all particle positions and velocities accord-
ing to the classical equations of motion.

The positions and velocities of the test-particles have no physical meaning. The
relevant quantities are the phase space distributions of the charges determined
by the ensemble of test-particles. It is easy to see that the resulting dynamics
provides a numerical solution of the Vlasov equation (18).

Hence, the PIC treatment as described so far does not account for any colli-
sional processes, such as formation of Rydberg atoms and subsequent electron-
atom scattering. Such collisions can however be incorporated into the PIC-
treatment on the basis of the collision integrals introduced in Eqs. (27)-
(29). Within such so-called particle-in-cell-Monte-Carlo-collision simulations
(PICMCC) [86] the collision terms in Eq. (18) are evaluated by random real-
izations of collision events, with a probability distribution determined by the
respective collision integral.

For the collision integrals given in Eqs. (28) and (29) describing inelastic col-
lisions and Rydberg atom formation, this stochastic evaluation procedure is
particularly simple. First, one introduces an additional species by providing
each ion with an additional label n, which characterizes its internal state.
If the particle is an ion, then n = 0, and n > 0 for atoms, where n de-
notes the principle quantum number of the atom. During each timestep of
length ∆t, an ion at position r is transformed into an atom with probabil-
n Ktbr(n, ρe(ri), Te). In this case, the corresponding princi-
ity Ptbr = ∆t
pal quantum number is sampled from the probability distribution Ptbr(n) =
∆tKtbr(n, ρe(ri), Te)/Ptbr. At the same time the electron number is decreased
by unity. Analogously, for bound states, an electron-atom collision occurs
p6=n Kbb(n, p, ρe(ra), Te)).
with the probability Pea = ∆t(Kion(n, ρe(ra), Te) +
With a probability Pion = ∆tKion(n, ρe(ra), Te)/Pea, this leads to ionization
of the atom. Otherwise, the collision results in a bound-bound transition
to a state with principal quantum number p with probability Pbb(n, p) =

P

∆tKbb(n, p, ρe(ra), Te)/Pea.

We ﬁnally note, that the tractable collision integrals are not limited to such
a simple case, but can also be nonlinear in the distribution functions. In par-
ticular, elastic electron-ion and ion-ion collisions can be described in a similar
way [33,94].

3.2.3 Hybrid Methods

So far we have discussed two complementary approaches which either provide
the full microscopic information about the early plasma evolution or allow
to follow the long-time dynamics on the cost of neglecting possible strong
correlations between the plasma particles.

While the ionic component may indeed form a strongly correlated state, it
turns out that the electrons remain weakly coupled during the entire plasma
evolution (see Section 4.5 and 4.6). In [34,39] this diﬀerent behavior of the
two particle species has been used to develop a hybrid-molecular-dynamics
approach. It treats the electrons and ions on diﬀerent levels of approximations,
combining the advantages of a mean ﬁeld treatment (electron dynamics) and
molecular dynamics simulations (ion motion). Collisions between electrons
and the heavy particles (atoms and ions) are accounted for within the Monte-
Carlo procedure described in the previous subsection. By eliminating the short
dynamical timescale of the bound electron motion this method signiﬁcantly
reduces the numerical workload, while simultaneously enabling a virtually
exact numerical simulation of the ion dynamics fully incorporating ion-ion
correlations.

The numerical eﬀort may be further reduced within an adiabatic approxima-
tion for the electrons. As discussed in Section 3.1.1, the small electron-to-ion
mass ratio permits an adiabatic approximation, where instantaneous (on the
timescale of the ion dynamics) equilibration of the electrons is assumed. Keep-
ing this approximation in a (hybrid) MD approach means that much larger
timesteps may be chosen, since the electronic dynamics does not need to be
resolved. In this way, an MD simulation of the ion motion over the whole
timescale of the experiments becomes feasible. According to Eq. (20), the elec-
tronic distribution function is then given by a quasistatic distribution f (qs)
at
all times.

The exact form of f (qs)
an ideal equilibrium, i.e. a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

, however, merits some discussion. The assumption of

leads to fundamental problems. Since the mean-ﬁeld potential ϕ has a ﬁnite
depth, the corresponding Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution approaches a ﬁnite
non-zero value even for r
and hence is not normalizable. In [33], this
problem was circumvented by introducing a spatially dependent electron tem-
perature which is constant within a ﬁnite region around the plasma center,
but decreases quadratically for large distances. An analogous problem was dis-
cussed long ago in an astrophysical context, in connection with the formation
of star clusters, where the assumption of a Maxwellian velocity distribution
implies an inﬁnite mass of the star cluster in complete analogy to the present
case. As discussed by Chandrasekhar [120], such a velocity distribution con-
tains particles (stars) with arbitrarily high velocities which are not bound to
the cluster potential. The rate with which these stars evaporate from the clus-
ter has also been considered in [120], and later in [121]. If the evaporation is
much slower than the relaxation of the stars remaining in the cluster, a qua-
sistationary distribution forms. Comparison with numerical simulations shows
that this distribution is well described by a truncated Maxwell-Boltzmann dis-
tribution

that uniquely determines the electronic density, temperature, and mean-ﬁeld
potential ϕ at all times. (In Eq. (52d), Ei is the sum of potential and kinetic
energies of all ions, and Ea is the sum of the electronic binding energies and
kinetic energies of all atoms.) Having calculated the electron density proﬁle at
time t, the knowledge of the corresponding electron mean ﬁeld force is used to
advance the ion positions and velocities under the inﬂuence of the electronic
mean ﬁeld and the full ion-ion interaction according to

In this propagation scheme it is still numerically quite costly to calculate the

allows the description of large systems, with

4 Physical Processes in Ultracold Neutral Plasmas

The previous section presented the experimental and theoretical tools to gen-
erate, detect, and understand ultracold neutral plasmas. In this section we will
use these tools to discuss physical processes. We proceed along the timeline
of the dynamics (Fig. 4), i.e., we start in Section 4.1 with electron equili-
bration after photoionization. Then we will cover the establishment of local
thermal equilibrium for the ions in Section 4.2. Before we come to the plasma
expansion (Section 4.4) into the surrounding vacuum, we introduce collective

excitations of the plasma electrons, which may be used to probe the plasma
expansion dynamics (Section 4.3).

Two more subsections are devoted to important topics. First, a detailed analy-
sis of the initial heating of the electrons, which aﬀects the expansion dynamics
is given in Section 4.5. Secondly, Section 4.6 will discuss in some detail the
evolution of the electronic and ionic Coulomb coupling parameters, which are
important since they indicate the degree of correlations that may be realized
in a plasma.

4.1 Initial Electron Equilibration

4.1.1 Trapping of Electrons

The ﬁrst experimental study of ultracold neutral plasmas [2] explored the cre-
ation of the plasma and trapping of the electrons by the ionic background
charge. (See Fig. 9.) Immediately after photoionization, the charge distribu-
tion is neutral everywhere. Due to the kinetic energy of the electrons, the
electron cloud expands on the timescale of the inverse electron plasma fre-
quency τe = ω−1
1 ns, where ρe is the electron density, and
ωp,e is the electron plasma oscillation frequency. On this timescale the ions are
essentially immobile. The resulting local charge imbalance creates a Coulomb

potential energy well that traps all but a small fraction (< 5%) of the electrons.
Smaller clouds, more ions and electrons, and lower initial electron kinetic en-
ergy all lead to a larger fraction of electrons trapped by the ions. Simple PICC
simulations [2] show that electrons escape mostly from the edges of the spatial
distribution.

This description implies that there is a threshold for trapping electrons. If
the well never becomes deeper than the initial kinetic energy, all the electrons
escape. This is demonstrated in Fig. 10, and the diagnostic used to obtain
this data was charged particle detection of electrons after they have left the
plasma, as shown in Fig. 5. In each cycle of the experiment, the atoms are
ﬁrst laser cooled and an electric ﬁeld of approximately 5 mV/cm is applied.
Subsequently, the atoms are photoionized, and after about 500 ns of time of
ﬂight a pulse of electrons arrives at the detector (see the ﬁrst peak in the curves
of Fig. 10). A few microseconds later, the electric ﬁeld is linearly increased. If
electrons have been trapped by the ionic background potential, they will be
liberated now to produce the second peak in the curves of Fig. 10. If the laser
intensity is so low that the well never becomes deeper than the initial kinetic
energy, no electrons are trapped and the second peak is missing (top trace). In
addition, when electrons are trapped, the ﬁrst peak develops a tail. Trapped
100 ns [60], and as charges are promoted to
electrons thermalize within 10
energies above the trap depth, they leave the well. On the time scale of this
experiment, the ions are essentially stationary.

leave the plasma must climb out of the potential formed by the ions, with
no neutralizing electrons. At threshold, the depth of this well equals Ee. The

The threshold condition Ni = N ∗ is mathematically equivalent to λD = σ,
where λD is the Debye screening length as deﬁned in Eq. (45) with Te =

tem to be considered a plasma [124], namely that the system size (σ) has to
be larger than the characteristic length scale (λD) on which local charge im-
balances are screened. In the present context, we can also interpret λD as the
displacement of electrons from their equilibrium positions when their energy in
the local internal electric ﬁeld in the plasma equals their kinetic energy [125].

trapped by the ion cloud. In the center of a typical ultracold neutral plasma,

such that the requirement for the existence of a plasma state is well fulﬁlled
under experimental conditions.

of ions required to begin trapping electrons grows with increasing Ee (left

by N ∗, the fraction of electrons trapped follows a universal curve, clearly
exhibiting the threshold Ni/N ∗ = 1 (right panel). For Ni < N ∗ no electrons
are trapped. This ﬁgure also shows that for N/N ∗

is solely determined by the ratio of the Debye length and the system size
like the global non-neutrality (Eq. (58)). The fractional non-neutrality is small
as long as λD < σ, typically less than 1% in the center of the plasma, where
the density is high. It becomes large near the edge, however, violating the
quasi-neutrality assumption, which may lead to deviations from the Gaussian
density proﬁle (see Section 4.4.4 for a more detailed discussion). For the major

Non-neutrality is also related to a spatially dependent electron temperature.
When using the deﬁnition of the Debye length λD in the above argumentat

38

we have implicitly assumed the existence of an electronic temperature. While
this is certainly a good approximation, a global thermal electron velocity dis-
tribution is just developing during the initial phase of the plasma relaxation.
PICMCC simulations (Section 3.2.2), which yield very good agreement with
the measured evaporating electron ﬂux [33], show that the velocity distribu-
tion in the central plasma region quickly reaches its Maxwellian form within
a few hundred 100 ns (see Fig. 13a). As shown in Fig. 13b it takes consider-
ably longer for a global equilibrium to develop. The center of the plasma is
seen to heat up, while the outer region cools down. The total electron kinetic
energy is, however, almost unaﬀected by these local temperature imbalances.
In reality, the electron gas heats up due to the formation of Rydberg atoms
[66,42,33,39] and an initial build-up of spatial electron correlations. The latter
process takes place simultaneously with the initial electron evaporation, but
is not observable in Fig. 13, due to the inability of the PIC treatment to de-
scribe the correlated dynamics of the electrons. A more detailed discussion of
the various electron heating mechanisms will be given in Section 4.5.

4.1.2 Spontaneous Ionization of a Dense Rydberg Gas

Compared to photoionization of a trapped cloud of ground state atoms, the
dynamics of plasma formation is more complicated when it is created by spon-
taneous ionization in a dense cloud of ultracold Rydberg atoms. Reference [56]
showed that some Rydberg atoms are initially ionized by black-body radia-
tion, collisions with hot background atoms, or Penning collisions with other
Rydberg atoms. Attractive dipole-dipole and van der Waals interactions that
pull Rydberg atoms together and enhance the Penning ionization rate are
particularly important for high principal quantum number (n > 50) [126].
Resulting electrons escape the cloud in the ﬁrst few microseconds until a few
thousand ions build up to form a Coulomb well that traps subsequently pro-
duced electrons. This is reminiscent of the model presented in Fig. 9. At this
point, the electrons seed an ionization avalanche. As much as 2/3 of the ini-
tial Rydberg population is ionized, and the remaining fraction is collisionally
de-excited to lower Rydberg levels, satisfying energy conservation [55]. Dur-
ing the avalanche, l -changing electron-Rydberg collisions, n-changing electron-
Rydberg collisions, electron-Rydberg ionizing collisions, and Penning ionizing
Rydberg-Rydberg collisions all play a role [55,127]. By exciting Rydberg atoms
with a relatively low density in a pre-existing ultracold plasma, it was shown
in [68] that very tightly bound Rydberg atoms (n
20) could be ionized by
electron-Rydberg collisions in these systems. The energetics of electrons in
plasmas created in this way, such as the equilibrium temperature after the
ﬁrst few tens of nanoseconds, is a question that has not been well-explored.
Theory [33] predicts no drastic change as the excitation laser crosses the ion-
ization threshold and the experiment changes from direct photoionization to
initial excitation of Rydberg atoms. Recent experimental work supports this

4.2 Initial Ion Equilibration

The establishment of LTE for the ions occurs on a longer timescale than it
does for the electrons, and it is conveniently studied experimentally. In addi-
tion, several inelastic processes (most notably three-body recombination) that
heat the electrons do not aﬀect the ions. In this unusual regime, interesting
phenomena are expected to be observable.

Theoretically, the ion dynamics can be studied within the Hybrid Molecular
Dynamics approach outlined in Section 3.2.3. In this approach, the ions are
propagated individually, so that full information about their positions, veloc-
ities, as well as spatial correlations is available. Experimentally, on the other
hand, the optical techniques described in Section 2.2.2 provide an excellent
tool for following the ion dynamics.

4.2.1 Disorder-induced heating

Figure 14 shows that the experimental evolution of the ion temperature of an
ultracold plasma and the theoretical curve obtained from a hybrid-MD simula-
tion are in good quantitative agreement over a time relevant for ion thermaliza-
tion [30]. The most striking observation from Fig. 14 is the rapid heating of the

40

plasma ions by several orders of magnitude, which is the so-called “disorder-
induced heating” or “correlation heating.” It originates from the fact that the
system is created in an undercorrelated state far from thermodynamic equi-
librium. Immediately after photoionization, the ions in an ultracold neutral
plasma have very little kinetic energy. But they are spatially uncorrelated,
and there is signiﬁcant excess potential energy in the system compared to the
equilibrium state in which spatial correlations keep ions from being close to
each other [128,11]. During early evolution of the plasma, correlations develop
and potential energy is converted into (thermal) kinetic energy [40,103,104]
leading to equilibration. However, during the disorder-induced heating phase,
the plasma is not in LTE, and the notion of an ion “temperature” should be
interpreted as a measure of the average ion kinetic energy.

Within the framework of the hydrodynamical model of Section 3.1.3, the
above interpretation of disorder-induced heating is immediately apparent in
Eq. (39c): As long as expansion of the plasma is still negligible (γ = 0), the
change in ion temperature is directly determined by the build-up of ion-ion
correlations (last term on the right-hand side of (39c)). This process has been
discussed in theoretical papers in many contexts. Early interest was generated
by non-equilibrium plasmas created by fast-pulse laser irradiation of solid
targets [129,130,131,80,81,132]. Experimental results were lacking, however,
because of the fast timescales involved and limited possibilities for diagnos-
tics. Ultracold neutral plasmas – much better suited for a detailed study of the
process – reinvigorated interest in the mechanism of disorder-induced heating
[37,38,40,103,104,133].

Qualitatively, one expects the timescale for the ion heating to be given by
the inverse of the ionic plasma frequency, ω−1
p,i , which is the typical timescale
on which spatial correlations develop in a plasma. Physically, ω−1
p,i is the time
for an ion to move one interparticle spacing when accelerated by a typical
Coulomb force of e2/4πε0a2, where a = (4πρi/3)−1/3 is the Wigner-Seitz ra-
dius. For the typical plasma of Fig. 14, ω−1
270 ns in good agreement
with the rise-time of the temperature observed in the ﬁgure. This timescale
102 ns is several orders of magnitude larger than in laser-generated high-
of
density plasmas as mentioned above, and it is easily resolved experimentally.
One would guess the ion temperature after equilibration would be on the order
of the Coulomb interaction energy between neighboring ions,

Here, κ = a/λD is the Debye screening constant, and ˜U is the excess potential
energy per ion. ˜U has been studied with molecular dynamics simulations [134]
for a homogeneous system of particles interacting through a Yukawa poten-
r/λD), which describes ions in the background of
tial, φ(r) = Ua(a/r) exp(
weakly coupled electrons [135]. To obtain Ti for given ρi and Te, one needs to
selfconsistently solve Eq. (63) with an analytic expression for ˜U [102] since ˜U
depends itself on Ti.

−

The arguments given above imply that both the timescale and the energy scale
of the disorder-induced heating depend on the plasma density only (apart from
a small dependence of the ﬁnal temperature on the screening κ, which will be
discussed below). Fig. 15 conﬁrms this expectation. If the measured eﬀective
ion temperature Ti,eﬀ is scaled with TC (Eq. (62)) and time with the inverse
plasma frequency ωp,i, the measured curves for diﬀerent densities coincide quite
well (Fig. 15(b)). Small diﬀerences in the curves are due to electron screening
of the ion-ion interaction. The eﬀect of electron is demonstrated in Fig. 16,
where Ti,eﬀ obtained from absorption spectra (Eq. (12)) is shown for diﬀerent
initial electron energies but the same ion density distribution: Smaller initial
electron energy (temperature) implies more screening and a lower equilibrium
ion temperature. The latter is directly related to the initial excess potential
energy (Eq. (63)), which is lowered if screening through electrons is increased.
It was found that the measured ion temperature just after the plasma reaches
LTE agrees well with the theoretical value Ti,ave according to Eq. (63) and
averaged over the ion distribution [28].

As emphasized in [133], it is not surprising that that Eq. (63) accurately pre-
dicts the ion temperature for equilibrating ultracold neutral plasmas, because
it basically expresses energy conservation. However, it is worth pointing out
that for data in Ref. [28] with the lowest ﬁt Te and highest ρ0i, the peak value
of κ in the plasma is 0.7. This corresponds to three electrons per Debye sphere
(κ−3 = ρe4πλ3
D/3). One might not necessarily expect Eq. (63) to be accurate
in this regime because it assumes a Yukawa potential for ion-ion interactions,
which is based on Debye screening and is normally derived for κ−3

4.2.2 Kinetic energy oscillations

A close inspection of Figs. 15 and 16 reveals that at the end of the disorder-
induced heating phase, the ion temperature overshoots its equilibrium value
before settling to it. This phenomenon is even more evident in Fig. 17, where
Ti,eﬀ is shown for an inner and outer region of the plasma image (ρ = √x2 + y2 <
0.9 σ and ρ > 1.48 σ, respectively). Each selected annular region contains 1/3
of the ions and probes a region with signiﬁcantly less variation in density than
in the entire plasma. The region with lower density has lower ion temperature,
as expected from Eq. (63), but the oscillation is the most striking observation.
The oscillation was also observed in a calcium plasma with ﬂuorescence mea-
surement [13] (Fig. 18). The contrast of the oscillations is strong in this case
because the small volume of the plasma excited by the ﬂuorescence excitation
laser signiﬁcantly reduced the variation of the sampled density. Numerical

of time after photoionization in a region deﬁned by the excitation laser beam. The
velocity was extracted using Eq. (17), and the absolute calibration was obtained by
assuming the ions had an initial velocity distribution equal to that of the laser-cooled
atoms. The rapid increase of the velocity at early times is due to disorder-induced
heating. The subsequent slower increase reﬂects the expansion of the plasma, which
will be discussed in Section 4.4. The solid line is a ﬁt of the velocity to a model for
the plasma expansion plus an oﬀset representing the random thermal ion velocity.

distribution function (i.e. spatial correlations) and the one-particle distribu-
tion function (i.e. temperature) relax on the same timescale (1/ωp,i) due to the
strong long-range interactions. Normally, correlations relax much more quickly,
and the separation of these time scales is known as the Bogoliubov assumption
[136]. Studies with ultracold neutral plasmas represent the ﬁrst experimental
observation of kinetic energy oscillations, but it has been the subject of in-
tense theoretical study through analytic calculations [130] and simulations
[129,131,80,81,132,133,30] of equilibrating strongly coupled plasmas. Calcula-
tions [129,137] also show oscillations in the velocity autocorrelation function
in equilibrium systems.

Intuitively, one may relate this phenomenon to the motion of each ion in its
local potential energy well. The discussion of disorder-induced heating in the
previous section qualitatively ascribed the increase in ion kinetic energy to
each ion moving towards the minimum of its well. The time scale for this
motion is ω−1
p,i . However, the ion will not suddenly stop at the bottom of its
potential; it will overshoot and climb up the hill again. It is reasonable to
expect harmonic motion to persist for some time, as kinetic and potential
energy are interchanged. This suggests a kinetic energy oscillation at 2ωp,i,
which is in line with the observations. Also consistent with this description,
the oscillation period observed experimentally in Fig. 17 is longer in the outer
region where the average density is lower and hence the plasma frequency is
smaller. This also explains why averaging over the entire cloud such as in Fig.
14 obscures the oscillation: the motion dephases because of the variation in
ωp,i. In a disordered system corresponding to the ultracold plasma scenario,
there is probably no collective or long-range coherence to the motion, so in

45

spite of the fact that ωp,i sets the timescale of the oscillation, one must be
cautious about describing the motion as an ion plasma oscillation.

The numerical hybrid-MD approach permits the deﬁnition of a local temper-
ature. Hence, it provides better temporal and spatial resolution of Ti than the
experimental optical probes. As was shown in [73,29], the ion temperature
shows clear oscillations in space (i.e. as a function of the distance from the
center of the plasma) and, in fact, a wavelike oscillation pattern emanating
from the plasma center (Fig. 19).

From the experimental data, it is not straightforward to comment on the
damping of the observed kinetic energy oscillations because even in Fig. 17,
which provides an annularly-resolved, more-local probe of the system, the
analysis still averages over the density variation along the z-axis of the plasma.
This introduces dephasing because the ion temperature oscillates with the
local plasma frequency. A phenomenological model was developed in [71] to
describe the ion equilibration and kinetic energy oscillations in a manner that
could extract information on damping. The main assumptions of this model
are that ions execute damped harmonic motion at their local plasma oscillation
frequency and Eq. (63) determines the equilibrium ion kinetic energy and the
amplitude of oscillation around this value. Fits to the data using this model
showed that the damping time is close to 1/ωp,i, and higher particle density and
lower electron temperature give slightly stronger damping. Numerical studies
of homogeneous strongly coupled plasmas [80,29] suggest a similar damping
time for Γi ≥

5, with lower Γi leading to faster damping.

4.3 Collective Electronic Plasma Modes

Oscillation of the electron plasma, or more precisely of the electron density, is
a fundamental collective plasma mode ﬁrst described by Tonks and Langmuir
[138]. Excitation of this mode in an early experiment [32] ﬁrmly established
that the photoionized ultracold gas forms a plasma.

A straightforward way to resonantly excite this mode is with a radio-frequency
(rf) electric ﬁeld (Fig. 5). A small DC bias directs electrons that escape the
plasma to a charged particle detector in order to measure the response. Typical
electron signals from such an experiment [32] are shown in Fig. 20a. The
plasma is created at t = 0 and some electrons promptly leave the sample and
arrive at the detector at about 1 µs, producing the ﬁrst peak in the signal. The
resulting excess positive charge in the plasma creates the Coulomb potential
well that traps the remaining electrons [2]. As the plasma expands, the depth
of the Coulomb well decreases, allowing the remaining electrons to leave the
trap. This produces the broad peak at

25 µs.

×

In the presence of an rf ﬁeld an additional peak appears in the electron signal,
indicating that resonant excitation of plasma oscillations has pumped energy
into the plasma and raised the electron temperature. The elevated electron
temperature causes more electrons to reach the detector because it increases
the evaporation rate of electrons out of the Coulomb well.

This data [32] was initially analyzed assuming an expression for the angular
e2ρe/ε0me
oscillation frequency that is valid in a homogeneous gas (ωp,e =
[138]), and assuming that the excited mode was localized in regions of near res-
onant density. By assuming the peak response arrived when the average den-
sity in the plasma was in resonance, the changing resonant frequency showed
the decrease in plasma density with time as the plasma expanded into the sur-
rounding vacuum (Fig. 20b). Section 4.4 will discuss the expansion dynamics
in detail.

q

Reference [49] pointed out that even in the zero-temperature limit, the elec-
tron plasma resonance frequency should be modiﬁed because of the inhomo-
geneous density distribution. This eﬀect also causes the well known result
that for a spherically symmetric ﬂat-top density distribution, the frequency
becomes ω = ωp,e/√3. For a Gaussian density distribution, the plasma has
a continuous spectrum of electron-density oscillation frequencies, but spectral
weight is concentrated in a damped quasimode that is concentrated in lower
density regions of the cloud and has a frequency between 1/4 and 1/3 of ωp,e
for the peak density in the distribution. This implies that the approach of [32]
underestimated the density by about a factor of three, but does not change

the general conclusion that the plasma oscillation can be used to follow the
evolution of the plasma density.

In very recent work, this idea has been extended by Fletcher et al. [50] who
observed what appear to be Tonks-Dattner modes, which are electron density-
waves characteristic of plasmas with inhomogeneous density distributions in
which thermal eﬀects are important. (See Fig. 21.) If one goes beyond cold
plasma theory, and includes the eﬀect of electron temperature, electron plasma
oscillations follow the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation [140]

(64)

where k(r) is the local wavenumber. When the temperature or wavenumber
becomes high, the thermal term becomes dominant and the electron density
oscillation becomes a sound-wave. Tonks-Dattner modes are resonant electron-
density standing waves resulting from this thermal eﬀect, and they were orig-
inally seen in cylindrical plasmas designed to simulate meteor tails [141,142].
In these experiments, the plasma density increased towards the central axis,

48

and the modes resonated between the outer edge of the plasma and the re-
gion where ω = ωp,e. For higher frequency modes, more wavelengths ﬁt in the
resonant region. It is at ﬁrst surprising that thermal eﬀects are important in
ultracold plasmas. But because of the small plasma size, the wavelength for
density waves must be small and the wavevector must be large. This makes the
thermal term in the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation (Eq. (64)) comparable or
larger than ωp,e.

An accurate quantitative description of Tonks-Dattner modes was given by
[139], and it was adapted to explain the observations in ultracold plasmas.
The agreement is striking in spite of the fact that the authors had to make a
somewhat ad hoc assumption about the outer boundary for the standing wave
since there is not a well-deﬁned edge to a Gaussian-shaped ultracold plasma.
With additional theory input to understand this point, Tonks-Dattner modes
should provide an accurate diagnostic of the electron temperature with good
temporal resolution.

Hence, both types of collective electron excitations can provide information on
the time evolution of the plasma, its changing density and electron tempera-
ture, and may be used to monitor dynamical eﬀects in the plasma expansion.

4.4 Plasma Expansion

4.4.1 Physical Description

In all experiments performed so far, the plasma is unconﬁned and expands into
the surrounding vacuum. On a time scale of about 10 µs, the plasma changes
in size noticeably, as shown with absorption images of strontium plasmas in
Fig. 22.

As discussed in Section 4.1.1 in conjunction with the initial electron trapping,
the local charge imbalance due to the ﬁnite electron temperature causes a con-
ﬁning space charge potential. This traps the electrons such that a quasineutral
plasma state develops, but the potential experienced by the ions has opposite
sign, which drives the expansion of the plasma at later times. In an alter-
native, but equivalent description, simple hydrodynamic arguments [32] show
that the expansion can also be related to the thermal pressure of the electrons,
since the hydrodynamic force per ion due to the electron thermal motion and
plasma spatial gradient is given by (see eq.(21))

that is distinct from random thermal velocity, such that the ion kinetic energy
due to expansion increases as Ei = 3
0t2/σ2(t). This energy increase
has to be compensated by a decreasing temperature of the electrons which cool
according to Te(t) = Te(0)σ2(0)/σ2(t) (Eq. 24d). Thus, asymptotically all the
initial electron energy is transfered to the ions. Note that this energy transfer
is not due to elastic collisions between the electrons and the ions, which would
require milliseconds to equilibrate the energy of two plasma components.

This problem is important for understanding plasmas created by irradiation
of solid and thin ﬁlm targets [146,17,16,19,20], clusters [25], and gas jets [27]
by intense laser pulses, and dusty plasmas [147], which are important in as-
trophysical systems and plasma processing.

4.4.2 Studying the Expansion with Electron Plasma Oscillations

The ﬁrst quantitative experimental study of the expansion was performed
using excitation of electron plasma oscillations as a probe of the density as
described in Section 4.3. Data such as in Fig. 23 was ﬁtted assuming σ(t)2 =
σ(0)2 + (v0t)2 for the expansion. The oscillation probe is only sensitive to
times when the plasma has already reached a ﬁnal velocity. Figure 24 shows
the extracted values of v0. For data with Ee ≥
70 K, the expansion velocities
approximately follow v0 = [Ee/(αmi)]1/2, where mi is the ion mass and α = 1.7
is a ﬁt parameter. This equates to v0 = [0.9kBTe(0)/mi]1/2 if kBTe(0) = 2
3Ee,
in reasonable agreement with the theory.

For very low Ee, the plasma expands as if the electrons had much more energy
than Ee (Fig. 24). Diﬀerent authors addressed this issue in a series of theory pa-
pers pointing to the importance of continuum lowering [148], disorder-induced
heating [37,38], and recombination [42] as sources of electron heating. A more
detailed discussion of these issues is given in Section 4.5. The heating becomes
important just as Γe is approaching one, which is interesting, as it might in-

dicate the onset of strong coupling eﬀects of the electrons. On the other hand
this heating also implies that it is diﬃcult to create strongly coupled electrons.
There is still more work to be done to study the dependence of the heating on
various parameters in order to work out the details of the dominant heating
sources.

4.4.3 Studying the Expansion with Optical Probes

The expansion can also be studied with optical probes. Because of the better
time resolution of these techniques, it is possible to follow the entire expansion
from plasma formation, through ion acceleration, to terminal velocity. One can
thus make an accurate comparison between experiment and theory.

References [70] and [13] used the ion ﬂuorescence to follow the spatial expan-
sion of a calcium plasma. By placing the focused excitation laser at various
distances from the center of the plasma, they measured ﬂuorescence proﬁles up
to 50 µs after photoionization (Fig. 1 of [13]) and found reasonable agreement
with a modiﬁed version of the theory [33,73] that addressed the lack of spher-
ical symmetry. They also found that for Ee < 100 K, the plasma expanded
with more energy than expected from Ee [70]. The ion velocity was probed
spectrally using ﬂuorescence from a resonant excitation beam passing through
the plasma center [13]. Changes in the ﬂuorescence level could be ascribed to
changes in Doppler broadening and ion velocity, resulting in the data in Fig.
18.

Fig. 25. Studying plasma expansion with optical absorption imaging. The rms ve-
locity along the laser beam is extracted from the width of the absorption image
(2.2.2). The dominant contribution is from the expansion velocity but there is a
contribution from the ion thermal velocity that produces the 10 m/s oﬀset at short
1015 m−3 and initial
times. The initial peak density of these plasmas was n0 = 3.5
size σ0 = 1 mm. The initial electron kinetic energies are indicated in the legend.
The solid-line ﬁts to the data assume a self-similar expansion of the plasma as de-
scribed in Eq. 67. This implies that the 1-dimensional rms ion velocity is given
by
kBTi,eﬀ/mi, where Ti,ef f is given by Eq. (B.4). The initial electron temper-
ature can be extracted from the ﬁts, and the agreement with expected values for
the two higher temperature plasmas indicates that three-body recombination and
disorder-induced heating of electrons is not signiﬁcant for this data. If the electron
temperature did not drop due to adiabatic expansion, the ion velocity would follow
the dashed-line curves.

In [28], the ion kinetic energy was found with the absorption spectra, and
this was related to the expansion velocity and the average ion temperature.
Initially, the technique was only applied to early times before adiabatic cool-
ing of the electrons became important, but recent improvements have allowed
study of longer times (Fig. 25). For a broad range of conditions, agreement is
excellent with Eq. (B.4), which assumes a self-similar expansion (Eq. 24) and
that after the ﬁrst few microseconds the only mechanism eﬀecting the elec-
tron temperature is adiabatic cooling. At lower Ee and higher density, similar
measurements show that electron heating eﬀects contribute more signiﬁcantly
and for longer times (Section 4.5.2). The data shows strong indications of
the approach to a terminal velocity, connecting the acceleration phase to the
measurements of Figs. 23 and 24.

4.4.4 Plasma expansion and ion dynamics

The eﬀect of the plasma expansion on the ionic temperature and, in turn, the
inﬂuence of the ion relaxation on the expansion, can be understood qualita-
tively from the hydrodynamical description of Section 3.1. First, neglecting
ionic correlations (Uii = 0) the expansion leads to adiabatic cooling of the
ions, analogous to the electron dynamics (see Eq. (24)). In addition, however,
the ion temperature also changes due to the development of ionic correla-
tions mainly through disorder-induced heating discussed in Section 4.2.1 and
described by eqs. (39). Moreover, these correlations reduce the ion-ion inter-
action (compared to the spatially uncorrelated case, where pairs of closely
neighboring atoms carry a large potential energy), and therefore lead to an
eﬀective negative acceleration, expressed by the Uii/3-term in eq. (39b), in
addition to the ideal thermal pressure. This contribution, which corresponds
to the average nonideal pressure known from homogeneous systems [3,97], also
leads to an eﬀective potential in which the ions move. As they expand in this
potential, the thermal energy increases due to energy conservation. Finally,
(39b) shows that the expansion is to the largest extent driven by the elec-
Ti even after the disorder-induced heating, since
tronic pressure, since Te ≫
Uii is of the same order as Ti.

As the plasma expands, the spatial proﬁle of the ions must deviate from its
original Gaussian shape [33]. This is mainly due to deviations from quasineu-
trality, e.g., deviations from the linear space dependence of the outward di-
rected acceleration, at the plasma edge. The inﬂuence of the nonlinear corre-
lation pressure on the density proﬁle is of minor importance, as can be seen
by comparing the solid and dot-dashed line of Fig. 26a in the inner plasma
region. As known from earlier studies of expanding plasmas based on a mean-
ﬁeld treatment of the particle interactions [149,150,33], a sharp spike develops
at the plasma edge, shown by the dot-dashed line in Fig. 26a. At later times,

this spike decays again when the maximum of the hydrodynamic ion veloc-
ity passes the position of the density peak, so that the region of the peak
is depleted. Ultimately, at long times, the entire plasma approaches the pro-
ﬁle of a quasineutral selfsimilar expansion [150]. From Fig. 26a it becomes
apparent that with ionic correlations, the peak structure is less pronounced
than in mean ﬁeld approximation. This is due to dissipation caused by ion-ion
collisions which are fully taken into account in the hybrid-MD simulation. As
shown in [150], by adding an ion viscosity term to the hydrodynamic equations
of motion, dissipation tends to stabilize the ion density and prevents the occur-
rence of wavebreaking which was found to be responsible for the diverging ion
density at the plasma edge in the case of a dissipationless plasma expansion.
Furthermore, the initial correlation heating of the ions largely increases the
thermal ion velocities leading to a broadening of the peak structure compared
to the zero-temperature case.

4.5 Electron Heating Mechanisms

Figures 23 and 24 suggest that plasmas strongly deviate from the the sim-
ple selfsimilar expansion (Eq. (24)) when the plasma becomes dense and the
initial kinetic energy of the electrons, Ee, becomes small, suggesting that addi-
tional physical processes heat the electrons. This question has been addressed
in a series of theory papers [43,148,38,127,41,37,42,33,151], proposing diﬀerent
heating mechanisms. The general conclusion is that the electron heating pro-
cesses restrict the temperature of the electrons such that the electron Coulomb
0.2.
Coupling parameter is limited to Γe

The NIST group [67] determined the electron temperature directly as a func-
tion of time after photoionization by tipping the conﬁning Coulomb potential
and measuring the fraction of electrons that escaped over the lowered barrier.
The potential was tipped by applying a small electric ﬁeld pulse. The result
in Fig. 27 shows that over a wide range of initial electron kinetic energies,
Ee, the electrons cooled or heated within a couple of microseconds to Te ≈
60
K. Te subsequently dropped over the next 10 µs along a similar curve for all
conditions. While the high-temperature data are consistent with the collision-
less expansion (Eq. (24)), the low-temperature results clearly indicate electron
heating as the ﬁnal temperature is well above the initial kinetic energy given
to the electrons.

4.5.1 Disorder-induced electron heating

While the temperature measurements of [67] were limited to times larger than
a few microseconds due to the ﬁnite duration of the electric ﬁeld pulse, detailed
numerical studies of the short-time plasma dynamics have been performed by
several groups [38,41,37]. Since an accurate molecular dynamics treatment
requires huge numerical eﬀorts, in [38,41,37] this aspect of the plasma dynam-
ics has been studied for a smaller model system with a reduced ion-electron
mass ratio. Fig. 28 shows the calculated time evolution of the scaled electron
temperature 1/Γe, for the extreme case of both zero initial ion temperature
and zero initial electron kinetic energy, i.e., for an ionizing laser frequency
that exactly matches the ionization potential of the cold atoms. Naively, one
might expect very strong particle correlations at these low temperatures. How-
ever, the electron component is not created in a correlated equilibrium state
and heats up in the same way as dicussed in Section 4.2.1 for the ionic case.
Immediately after photoionization spatial electron-electron and electron-ion
correlations are practically negligible. They begin to develop on a timescale
of the inverse electronic plasma frequency ω−1
meε0/e2ρe lowering the
electron potential energy, which is released as heat to the electrons. Due to
the small electron mass the correlation build-up is much faster than for the
ions, heating up the electrons within a few tens of nanoseconds. Since there are
two contributions from electron-electron and from electron-ion correlations, we
may estimate the ﬁnal equilibrium excess correlation energy as two times the
expression for ucorr given in Eq. (43). Energy conservation, 3Γ−1

An estimate of the released energy for the expansion velocity measurement of

is therefore not suﬃcient to explain the observed enhanced plasma expansion.

4.5.2 Rydberg atoms formed through three-body recombination

In three-body recombination (TBR) [152,44], an electron and an ion recombine
to form a highly excited Rydberg atom, while a second electron participates
in the collision to conserve energy and momentum. TBR is an important pro-
cess in ultracold neutral plasmas, which may be surprising because at typical
plasma temperatures of 1000 K or more, TBR is only important in dense plas-
mas. At low densities on the order of 1010 cm−3, recombination typically pro-
ceeds by radiative recombination (RR) and dielectronic recombination (DR)
[152,153].

TBR dominates in ultracold plasmas because the total three-body rate varies
with temperature as T −9/2. This divergent temperature dependence has mo-
tivated investigations into whether TBR theory must be modiﬁed in the ul-
tracold regime [154,155,156,43]. In addition to the fundamental interest in

caping from the plasma. The third feature arises from ionization of Rydberg atoms.

TBR at low temperatures, the process is important in the formation of cold
antihydrogen through positron-antiproton recombination [45,46]. In ion stor-
age rings, collisions between ions and electrons in electron coolers can be in
the 10-100 K energy range, and anomalously large recombination rates have
been observed for highly charged ions [157]. Some authors have suggested an
enhanced contribution from TBR to explain a portion of the excess[158].

In addition to the fast initial rise of the temperature due to disorder-induced
heating, Fig. 28 indicates further electron heating on a slower timescale, which
is due to the formation of highly excited Rydberg atoms. Figure 29 shows
experimental evidence of recombination in an ultracold neutral plasma. The
origin of the time axis corresponds to the photoionization pulse. Immediately
after that, some electrons leave the sample and are directed to the detector by a
small DC ﬁeld (5 mV/cm), producing the ﬁrst peak in the signal. The ions are
essentially immobile on this timescale, and the resulting excess positive charge
in the plasma creates the Coulomb potential well that traps the remaining
electrons [2]. The broad peak corresponds to the escape of free electrons as
the Coulomb potential well vanishes as the plasma expands. After the free
electrons have escaped, the electric ﬁeld is increased to 120 V/cm in 50-100 µs.
This ﬁeld can ionize Rydberg atoms bound by as much as 70 K, corresponding
to a principal quantum number of about n = 47. From the number of electrons
reaching the detector, the number of Rydberg atoms formed can be inferred,
and from the ﬁeld at which the atoms ionize the distribution of Rydberg atoms
as a function of n can be constructed. The Rydberg atoms survive for hundreds
of microseconds with no signiﬁcant change in their distribution. This implies
that most of the atoms are in high angular momentum states which have long
radiative lifetimes [58].

completely convert into a Rydberg gas within a few microseconds. Contrary
to this, only a few percent of recombination is observed after 12µs for the
above initial conditions [66]. This has led to a series of theoretical investiga-
tions questioning the validity of the standard recombination theory [43] and
proposing strong coupling eﬀects on the recombination rate [154,159]. Sub-
sequent theory and experiments [66,37,42,67] indicate the opposite, namely
that the plasma is driven out of the strongly coupled regime, by subsequent
electron-atom collisions involving the formed Rydberg atoms, which tend to
additionally heat the electron gas. The corresponding increase in temperature
is in fact more rapid than from direct recombination and quickly quenches fur-
ther recombination due to the strong T −9/2
dependence of the rate. The simple
e
hydrodynamic description with standard collision rates [44], as described in
Section 3.1.2, yields a surprisingly good description of the plasma dynamics.
As shown in Fig. 30 the enhanced expansion velocity of Fig. 24 can indeed be
reproduced upon inclusion of electron-Rydberg-atom collisions, and the hy-
drodynamic model even yields a quantitative description of the temperature
measurement [67].

The measured distribution of principal quantum numbers for the Rydberg
atoms also revealed that moderately tightly bound levels (n < 50) were popu-
lated in the plasma, and that the binding energy of the Rydberg atoms closely

59

matched the excess energy that appeared in the expansion as shown in Fig.
24 [66].

Although the discussion about the validity of the conventional recombination
theory under the conditions of an ultracold plasma is still not settled, the pre-
sented measurements [66,67] together with supporting theoretical calculations
provide strong arguments for the applicability of the classical recombination
rates even in the low -temperature regime.

4.6 Coulomb Coupling Parameters

As stated many times before in this review, fundamental interest in ultracold
neutral plasmas to a large extent stems from the possibility of creating strongly
coupled plasmas. For a system of charges embedded in a uniform neutralizing
background, formally called a one-component plasma (OCP) [97], local spa-
tial correlations characteristic of a strongly coupled ﬂuid appear for Γ
2. As
Γ further increases and eventually exceeds a value of 174 the system crystal-
lizes. While the OCP model was originally developed to describe dense neutron
stars, with ions embedded in a degenerate electron background, a clean exper-
imental realization of an OCP is provided by laser cooled ion clouds conﬁned
in Penning [160,161,97] or Paul [162,163] traps.

≥

In a real two-component plasma (TCP) the situation can be very diﬀerent.
Besides the possibility of forming bound states, electrons will tend to shield the
ion-ion interaction potential. For weakly coupled electrons, within the Debye-
H¨uckel theory, the Coulomb interaction is replaced by an interaction potential

Ultracold plasmas provide the ﬁrst precise experimental studies of two-component
plasmas with both components in or near the strongly coupled regime. As we
have discussed, however, various heating mechanisms currently preclude the
exploration of plasmas deep in the strongly coupled regime (Γ

4.6.1 Electronic Coulomb Coupling Parameter

At the lowest possible initial electron temperatures of about 0.1K, limited by
the linewidth of the ionizing laser, and typical densities of 109cm−3 very large
Coulomb parameters of about 30 might be expected. As outlined in the pre-
vious section there are however various heating mechanisms quickly decreas-

ing this value. After an initial disorder induced heating phase, the electrons
are further heated by Rydberg atom formation and subsequent electron-atom
collisions. Interestingly, Γe approaches an almost universal value largely in-
dependent of the initial plasma parameters. This is demonstrated in Fig. 31,
showing results of PICMCC simulations (see Section 3.1) for two diﬀerent
initial temperatures [42]. When three-body recombination is turned oﬀ, Γe
increases in time due to the adiabatic cooling of the electron gas. When the
formation of Rydberg atoms is taken into account this increase is strongly
suppressed by the heating of the electron gas. While the initial evolution is
qualitatively diﬀerent for the high and low temperature case, respectively,
0.2 within about 10µs. This prediction
both curves approach a value of Γe ≈
has been conﬁrmed by subsequent temperature measurements, discussed in
Section 4.5. Although such a PICMCC treatment can not describe any type
of particle correlations of the plasma and hence neglect the disorder-induced
electron heating, the measured value of the plateau is consistent with the the-
oretical result of 0.2, within the experimental uncertainty. This suggests that
Rydberg atom formation indeed constitutes the dominant heating mechanism
and correlation eﬀects do not play a signiﬁcant role for the electron dynamics.

4.6.2 Ionic Coulomb Coupling Parameter

This situation is diﬀerent for the ionic component, whose temperature is prac-
tically not aﬀected by inelastic collisions due to the much larger mass of the
ions. Heating can therefore only arise from correlation build-up. PICMCC

61

simulations (Fig. 31) are unable to describe Γi, since an accurate treatment
of ion-ion correlations is required, as can be achieved within the hybrid-MD
approach introduced in Section 3.2.3.

exp[

In order to calculate Γi one needs to know the ion temperature and den-
sity. Experimentally, Ti,ave can be determined from the absorption spectra
[28] or ion ﬂuorescence [13]. The density can be determined from absorption
images, knowledge of the neutral atom parameters and the ionization frac-
tion, or the timescale of the disorder-induced heating. In order to estimate
the eﬀect of screening, the electron temperature must be known. Finally,
the inhomogeneity of the density distribution must be taken into account.
One way to do this is to calculate the density-averaged coupling parameter,

The surprisingly small variation in Γ∗

perature should be of the order of the Coulomb interaction energy between
neighboring ions, which directly translates into Γ

The question remains of how the Coulomb coupling parameter evolves in time
as the system expands. The simple hydrodynamical model (Eq. 24) predicts
that the ion temperature decrease during the expansion should overcompen-
sate the accompanying decrease in density, so that the Coulomb coupling

parameter should increase
Experimentally, such a prediction is hard to check, since the directed radial
expansion velocity quickly overwhelms the thermal velocity component. The-
oretically, on the other hand, it is straightforward to separate the thermal
velocity components in the hybrid-MD simulation [39].

∝

Figure 32 shows that Γi does increase as the system expands. Hence, one
might conclude that it is suﬃcient to simply wait long enough to allow the
system to cool down in order to reach the crystallized state. However, it is
questionable whether one should speak of a “crystal” if the density drops
below that of interstellar space by the time it reaches a Γ of 200. But there is
also a fundamental problem; the coupling parameter Γi measures the amount
of correlations in a plasma if the system is in in thermodynamic equilibrium,
but the plasma is created far from equilibrium in a completely uncorrelated
initial state. Disorder-induced heating leads to local local thermal equilibrium,
but the plasma continuously expands, so a true static equilibrium is never

reached. One must compare the coupling parameter formally calculated from
temperature and density with the spatial correlation properties of the system
at all times.

In [30], this question was studied by extracting an alternative coupling param-
eter ˜Γi from the pair correlation functions gii(r) obtained with the hybrid-MD
approach (dashed line in Fig. 32). In line with the preceding discussion, Γi
and ˜Γi initially have no similarity at all, reﬂecting the fact that the plasma is
very far away from any kind of equilibrium. (In addition, Fig. 3(a) of reference
[30] shows that the pair correlation function at early times is not well ﬁt by
that of an equilibrium system, so that a parametrization of gii by a single
scalar quantity ˜Γi does not adequately describe the plasma’s spatial correla-
tion properties. For 5 < ωp,it < 20, the two curves for Γi and ˜Γi approach each
other and run in parallel, suggesting that the plasma is close to a changing
quasi-steady state during this stage.

For ωp,it > 20, however, the two curves diverge again, and ˜Γi settles towards a
ﬁnite value of ˜Γi ≈
11 deep in the strongly coupled regime, but still far away
from a value where the occurrence of long-range order might be observed.
In other words, while the system expands and cools down (reﬂected in the
further increase of Γi), the spatial correlations in the system (parametrized by
˜Γi) do not change anymore. On a formal level, this freeze-out of correlations
is caused by another violation of the Bogoliubov assumption [136], namely a

63

cross-over of the timescale for relaxation of correlations with the hydrodynamic
timescale on which macroscopic system parameters change. More intuitively,
the build-up of spatial correlations requires strong interactions between the
ions in order to cause a rearrangement of their spatial correlational structure.
As the system expands, the timescale on which such rearrangement takes place
becomes longer and longer as the inter-ionic forces become weaker and weaker.
At some point, the system simply becomes so dilute that the rearrangement
does not occur anymore, and the spatial structure of the plasma freezes out
in a selfsimilar expansion. As a consequence, the plasma remains in a state
governed by strong short-range correlations, but no long-range order should
form.

5 Achieving Strong Coupling

As emphasized in various sections of this article, one of the main motivations
for studying ultracold plasmas from a plasma-physics perspective is the fact
that they are strongly coupled, and one might hope to create crystalline plas-
mas. Coulomb crystallization is actively studied in one-component systems,
such as magnetically conﬁned ions [164,165] and dusty plasmas [166,167,168].
Equivalent studies in two-component plasmas, on the other hand, are more
scarce, as their experimental realization poses several additional constraints
[169]. In this respect ultracold neutral plasmas have attracted considerable
attention as a promising opportunity to observe this phenomenon in the lab-
oratory.

However, as discussed above, three-body recombination strongly heats the
plasma electrons, while the disorder-induced heating rooted in the (spatially)
uncorrelated nature of the initial plasma state (i.e., after creation of the plasma
by photoionization) rapidly heats electrons and ions. This was realized soon
after the ﬁrst experiment, and diﬀerent suggestions have been put forward to
mitigate these eﬀects.

For ions, these suggestions may be divided into two groups. On the one hand,
one may avoid the disorder-induced heating. Since this heating eﬀect is directly
related to the uncorrelated initial state of the plasma, such approaches always
aim at introducing some amount of correlation in the spatial distribution of
the atoms before the plasma is formed by photoionization. We will discuss such
approaches in Section 5.1.2 below. On the other hand, one might counteract
the disorder-induced heating by removing energy from the system during its
evolution rather than avoiding the heating from the outset. In this case, one
needs a way to couple the system to its environment in order to dissipate part
of its internal energy, i.e., to cool it. Doppler laser cooling has been suggested
as a way to achieve this goal. Since it is, in our opinion, the most promising

64

perspective for achieving plasma crystallization at this point, we will discuss
it in detail in Section 5.1.1. Finally, a recent proposal to increase the coupling
of the plasma electrons by adding Rydberg atoms to the plasma, the only
suggestion so far aiming at the electronic component of the plasma, will be
brieﬂy discussed in Section 5.2.

5.1 Ionic coupling

5.1.1 Laser-cooling the ions

As stated above, the idea behind laser cooling the plasma ions is to coun-
teract disorder-induced heating by removing energy from the system via an
external cooling mechanism. Such an approach is experimentally feasible if
alkaline earth elements are used for the plasma, as their singly charged ions
have a single outer electron which provides a convenient cooling transition for
currently available laser systems. Hence, a “standard” Doppler cooling scheme
may be used to cool the ions, with an optical molasses created by six coun-
terpropagating lasers in a 3d conﬁguration (cf. Fig. 2). The plasma ions can
then be cooled during the whole evolution of the system.

Experimentally, the scheme outlined above has not yet been realized. However,
there is little doubt that it should be feasible 4 . In fact, a ﬁrst step in this
direction has already been taken with the Doppler imaging of the ion dynamics
described in detail in Section 2.2.2, since the same transition that is used for
the imaging can also be used for the cooling. Theoretically, the above scenario
has been studied in detail in [34,94].

Originally, the idea of Doppler laser cooling the ions was proposed in [37]
and [170]. These studies also correctly pointed out the potentially crucial role
of elastic electron-ion collisions in the plasma in such a scenario. In a freely
evolving plasma, such collisions are usually negligible, due to the fact that the
timescale for electron-ion thermalization is much longer than the timescale
of the plasma expansion. Hence, the heating of the ions during the ﬁrst mi-
crosecond of evolution due to these collisions is limited to a few milli-Kelvin,
which is negligible compared to the additional disorder-induced heating which
is orders of magnitude stronger. In the case of laser cooling, however, the ﬁnal
ion temperature one is aiming for is also in the milli-Kelvin range, i.e., of the
same order as the energy transferred from electrons to the ions via elastic colli-
sions. Hence, these collisions should be taken into account when discussing the
possibility of plasma crystallization. In [37,170], their inﬂuence on the achiev-
able ionic temperature was estimated using reasonable values for initial-state

achieved for light ions such as Be.

temperatures and densities. It was concluded that the ionic Coulomb coupling
50 due to these elastic collisions,
parameter would be limited to a value Γi ≈
outside of the crystallized regime. However, these estimates assumed a con-
stant heating rate corresponding to the chosen initial conditions. What was
not taken into account is the expansion of the plasma, which strongly reduces
the electron temperature and density, which reduces the collisional heating.
As a consequence, these estimates are too pessimistic.

A detailed numerical investigation of the laser cooling process was carried
out in [34,94], using both the hydrodynamic approach and the hybrid-MD
approach introduced in Section 3. Insight into the modiﬁcations induced by
the laser cooling can be obtained from a hydrodynamical description. On the
level of a kinetic description, the inﬂuence of the cooling laser can be modeled
via a Fokker-Planck term in the time evolution of the ionic distribution fi,

As readily observed from Eq. (70) the laser cooling dramatically modiﬁes the
expansion, not only quantitatively, but even qualitatively. While the width σ
of the plasma cloud increases linearly in time for the free expansion, it only
t1/4 in the laser-cooled case. As a consequence, the plasma ex-
varies as
pands much slowly than in the case of free expansion. This raises the hope of
achieving a long-range ordered state, since we have seen in the previous section
that it is the decrease in density and the corresponding increase in relaxation
timescale that leads to a freeze-out of spatial correlation properties for a freely
expanding plasma. In the laser-cooling scenario, the much slower decrease in
density should allow for much longer times during which eﬃcient rearrange-
ment processes may occur, a prerequisite for the build-up of long-range order.
One may, at ﬁrst glance, think that this problem might be circumvented in
any case by just increasing the cooling rate β suﬃciently. However, this is not
the case, since a too rapid cooling could freeze the plasma in a metastable

disordered state. The system needs a certain time for spatial rearrangement
to occur, which will not happen if the cooling is too fast.

In order to obtain information about the build-up of spatial correlations, one
needs to go beyond a kinetic description of the ion distribution function. In
[34] this was achieved within the hybrid-MD approach of Section 3.2.3, where
the inﬂuence of the cooling lasers on the ions is described by a Langevin
term consisting of a dissipative cooling force and a stochastic diﬀusive part.
In addition, elastic electron-ion collisions should be taken into account in the
description as discussed above. Such collisions can be implemented using a
Monte Carlo procedure described in detail in [94]. It is found that the resulting
structures formed during the system evolution may depend strongly on the
initial-state parameters, such as number of ions, electron temperature, and
cooling rate. Thus, the electronic temperature must be chosen suﬃciently high
in order to keep three-body recombination at a negligible level. As discussed in
[34], three-body recombination creates doubly-excited and hence autoionizing
states with an excess energy of several thousand Kelvin above the continuum
limit. Hence, any autoionization process results in a fast electron which would
not be bound in the ionic potential well, thereby destroying the plasma.

There are also signiﬁcant constraints on the cooling rate β. As discussed above,
if the cooling is too fast, the plasma will be frozen in a disordered glass-like
state. On the other hand, if the cooling is too slow, the density decreases too
strongly for eﬀective inter-ionic interactions to take place. As we have seen
in Section 4.6, reaching low temperatures and correspondingly high coupling
parameters does not yet ensure spatial order in the plasma. However, it was
demonstrated in [34,94] that, depending on particle number and cooling rate,

67

glass-like order or the formation of concentric shells may occur (see Fig. 33
and Fig.34).

While the precise dynamics of this structure formation is not yet completely
understood, it appears suﬃciently robust that the crystallization should be
observable experimentally with current state-of-the-art cooling techniques.
Such an experimental conﬁrmation, together with further detailed experimen-
tal and theoretical studies, would allow signiﬁcant physical insight into the
dynamics of strongly coupled two-component plasmas at the liquid-crystal
phase transition. In particular, there are both similarities and diﬀerences with
laser-cooled ion clouds in ion traps, where shell structures are also observed
and intensively studied [160,171,172,173,174,175,176]. It may appear surpris-
ing that long-range order may occur in the present case of an unconﬁned
plasma where, in contrast to trapped ion clouds, the crystallization process
can only take place over a ﬁnite amount of time. Pronounced diﬀerences also
exist in the dynamics of the crystallization process, which starts at the outer
edge of the ion cloud in the case of ions in a trap, but is observed to proceed
from the center of the plasma in the present scenario. Moreover, the spherical
structure of small ion crystals can be attributed to the spherical symmetry
of the trapping potential, while in the present case it must be traced to the
spherical symmetry of the initial density distribution. This raises the question
of what is the expected symmetry resulting from an ellipsoidal initial-state
density [13].

5.1.2 Other Approaches

The crystallized regime would be reached more directly by avoiding the disorder-
induced heating right from the start, rather than counteracting it by external
cooling. Avoiding (or at least weakening) it requires a certain amount of spa-
tial order in the initial state, i.e., one must generate a signiﬁcant degree of
spatial correlation before the plasma is created by photoionization. A number
of proposals exist for how such an ordered state may be obtained, namely (i)

68

using fermionic atoms cooled below the Fermi temperature, so that the Fermi
hole around each atom prevents the occurrence of small interatomic distances
[40]; (ii) an intermediate step of exciting atoms into high Rydberg states, so
that the interatomic spacing is at least twice the radius of the correspond-
ing Rydberg state [103]; and (iii) using optical lattices to arrange the atoms
[103,133]. Calculations show that, indeed, these proposals could achieve a sig-
niﬁcant reduction of the disorder-induced heating, and the latter may even
result in correlation-induced cooling of the plasma [133]. However, realizing
the crystallized regime in this way turns to be very challenging experimentally
and the laser-cooling approach discussed in the previous section seems to be
more practical with current experimental capabilities.

5.2 Electronic coupling

All the scenarios discussed in the previous Section 5.1 aim at increasing the
coupling of the ions in order to reach the crystallized regime. On the other
hand, it would also be highly desirable to achieve strong coupling of the plasma
electrons. Many previously employed assumptions, such as the dependence of
three-body recombination rates on density and temperature, or the Thom-
son cut-oﬀ for the existence of Rydberg states are expected to fail in this
regime. Moreover, this would provide an intriguing realization of a classical
two-component system where both components are strongly coupled, with
exciting prospects for observing new and interesting phenomena.

The only proposal so far targeting the electronic coupling parameter was in-
troduced in [68]. The basic idea consists of deliberately adding Rydberg atoms
to the plasma, which should then be collisionally ionized by the free plasma
electrons, thereby reducing the kinetic energy of the electrons and cooling
them. Such a scenario has been studied systematically in [177], and it was
found that a moderate but still signiﬁcant manipulation of the electron tem-
perature is possible in this way. Figure 35 shows the time evolution of Te for
a plasma when Rydberg atoms with varying principal quantum number n are
added at t = 0. As can be seen, adding Rydberg atoms with n = 36 to the
plasma leads to a signiﬁcant reduction of Te compared to the pure plasma
without additional Rydberg atoms, in agreement with the original proposal
[68]. On the other hand, this eﬀect strongly depends on the principal quan-
tum number of the added Rydberg atoms. For lower excitation (n = 26 in the
present case), even the reverse eﬀect of a heating of the plasma electrons rather
than a cooling can be observed. This behavior, which might be surprising at
ﬁrst glance, is connected with the existence of a bottleneck in the transition
rates for the inelastic electron-impact induced bound-bound and bound-free
transitions of the atoms. If the binding energy Eb of an atom is larger than
4kBTe, the atom is predom-
a critical (temperature-dependent) energy Ec ≈

inantly driven to even lower states by collisions with the plasma electrons,
thereby heating them. If, on the other hand, Eb is smaller than Ec, collisions
tend to excite the atom to higher bound states or ionize it, and the plasma
electrons are cooled as originally envisioned.

Hence, by varying the principal quantum number of the added Rydberg atoms,
it is possible to control the rate and even the sign of the change of the electron
temperature. On the other hand, varying their number inﬂuences the absolute
magnitude of the temperature change as well as the timescale over which
cooling can be achieved. Together, a remarkable amount of control over the
time evolution of the electronic temperature appears possible, in particular
if one considers the possibility of more sophisticated schemes of adding the
Rydberg atoms. Rather than adding all atoms simultaneously at t = 0, one
may think of adding them continuously over a certain amount of time, or in
a number of individual pulses (or generally speaking “on demand”). One can
also change the principal quantum number of the atoms in time. (The latter
might be necessary, e.g., to stay away from the bottleneck separating cooling
from heating, which changes as Te changes in time.)

In addition to the temperature reduction discussed above, the collisional ion-
ization of Rydberg atoms also increases the density of the plasma. Thus, both
eﬀects act cooperatively, increasing the Coulomb coupling parameter Γe as
desired. It was found in [177] that, using relatively simple schemes for the
0.5, as compared to Γe . 0.2
addition of the atoms, Γe reaches values of Γe ≈

70

found in the experiments with pure plasmas 5 . In more advanced scenarios
as outlined above, reaching the strongly coupled state of Γe > 1 should most
probably be realizable. The coupling strengths obtainable are certainly far
away from the regime where a crystallization of the electrons might be ob-
served. Still, pronounced liquid-like correlation eﬀects may be anticipated,
and the ﬁrst realization of a two-component system where both the electronic
and the ionic component are strongly coupled promises exciting new develop-
ments.

6 Conclusions and Future Directions

In this article we have reviewed the development in research on ultracold neu-
tral plasmas since their ﬁrst creation in 1999. We have described numerous ex-
perimental tools to probe various aspects of the system behavior, ranging from
optical imaging of individual ions to employing collective plasma excitations
as probes for macroscopic quantities. By combining such techniques, tradition-
ally rooted in both atomic and plasma physics, these experiments have studied
a number of plasma physics problems. They have revealed several surprises,
which fosters continuing theoretical interest. We have outlined the theoretical
concepts, developed to describe and understand the non-equilibrium dynamics
of ultracold neutral plasmas. Our discussion has covered diverse approaches,
such as simple reduced dynamical equations, kinetic or hydrodynamic descrip-
tions and demanding microscopic approaches.

Based on the techniques introduced we have given a detailed description of the
underlying physical processes driving this quite complex dynamical behavior.
Within a hand-in-hand experimental and theoretical discussion a step-wise de-
veloped physical picture of the plasma dynamics over various evolution stages
from its creation until its complete expansion into the surrounding vacuum has
been given. Thereby we have covered a wide spectrum of phenomena, ranging
from low-temperature collisions and Rydberg atom formation to the physics
of collective plasma excitations and eﬀects of strong correlations between the
plasma constituents.

This wealth of interesting physics revealed in the past years demonstrates the
rapid advancement in our understanding of these fascinating systems, but also
raises various open questions, which we have pointed out in this article. Future
studies in this young research ﬁeld will certainly produce unexpected results,
but several trends are likely to continue for the ﬁeld.

5 Experimental results so far are consistent with this theoretical prediction, but
still inconclusive since current schemes of extracting an electron temperature from
the experiment are not very precise.

71

As discussed in Section 5, the pursuit of stronger coupling in both the electrons
and ions will remain an exciting and therefore intensively followed avenue of
research. Experimental routes for increasing the ion coupling constant, such
as laser-cooling [37,170] or photionizing a pre-ordered sample [40,133], may
enable the formation of Wigner Crystals [34]. This will hopefully allow ex-
ploration of the phase diagram of particles interacting through a screened
Yukawa potential [178,101,102] that will compliment studies of dusty plas-
mas [9]. Creation of colder and denser electrons will show whether strongly
coupled electrons can be realized in ultracold plasmas or three-body recombi-
nation precludes this possibility.

Exploring the regime of stronger electron coupling will necessarily probe the
complicated evolution of the electron temperature when rapid thermalization,
disorder-induced heating, threshold lowering, and three-body recombination
play signiﬁcant roles. Powerful theoretical tools have been developed to address
these phenomena [41,37,38,42,33,43,73], but there is still need for a compre-
hensive study of evolution in various regimes of initial conditions and a disen-
tangling of the many contributing eﬀects. As emphasized in [33], the synthesis
of ideas from atomic physics and plasma physics is crucial for this research.
While techniques exist to study electron temperature at later times [67,50],
at present there is no experimental diagnostic to cleanly explore the electron
equilibration phase because electrons evolve so quickly. The development of
such diagnostic would be a signiﬁcant advance.

As the ﬁeld grows, there is great possibility to increase the connection to tra-
ditional areas of plasma physics. The role of strong-coupling and the equilibra-
tion and expansion dynamics partly resemble the behavior of laser-produced
plasmas in high energy-density experiments. But as we have emphasized from
the start of this review, the slower time scales, excellent diagnostics, and con-
trol over initial conditions in ultracold plasmas provide unique opportunities
to make signiﬁcant contributions to these other areas.

The recent success to produce cold Rydberg gases and plasmas in strong mag-
netic ﬁelds of several Tesla [179,180] has opened up a new regime, where the
atomic scale and macroscopic system dynamics is fundamentally diﬀerent from
the ﬁeld-free situation. Theory has just started to treat collisional [181,106,107]
and radiative [182,183,184] processes under such conditions, while the macro-
scopic dynamics of magnetized, ultracold, µm-scale neutral plasmas still awaits
a deeper understanding – all being essential questions for ongoing eﬀorts to
produce antihydrogen atoms [45,46].

New or improved experimental capabilities wait just over the horizon and
will certainly open many avenues of research. As the resolution for imaging
10 µm, this will allow studies of collective modes
techniques approaches
or other features of the ion density distribution. The use of light scattering

∼

to directly observe spatial correlations [161] and the application of magnetic
ﬁelds to conﬁne the plasma will also provide new possibilities.

In light of the rapid development reviewed in this article, the study of ultracold
neutral plasmas promises to remain an exciting and growing ﬁeld of research
for many years to come.

where the parameters are described below Eq. (12) in Section 2.2.2.

The expansion of the plasma described in Section 4.4 eventually becomes the
dominant source of Doppler broadening for the ion absorption spectrum in an
ultracold neutral plasma (Fig. 7). Fortunately, the expansion is approximated
well by a self-similar expansion of a Gaussian density distribution, and the
dynamics takes a particularly simple form when there are no heat sources for
the electrons and ion-electron thermalization is negligible. (See Section 3.1.2
and [32,33,34].) These assumptions are reasonable for plasmas of low density
and high initial electron energy Ee , although the exact regime of validity is
the subject of current study. In this regime, the dynamics is determined by the
parameters Te(0) and σ, where Te(0) is the electron temperature after any ini-
tial heating (Section 4.5). To be more speciﬁc, we assume that electron heating
is only important at very early times before plasma expansion is important,
and subsequently the electron temperature evolves only under the inﬂuence of
the adiabatic expansion. Hence, kBTe(0) may be slightly higher than 2

3Ee.

The expansion velocity proﬁle u(r, t) (Eq. (26)) gives rise to an average Doppler
shift of the resonant frequency that varies with position,

δν(r) = uz/λ =

where r cos θ is the displacement from the center of the cloud along the direc-
tion of laser propagation and t is the time after photoionization. The position-
dependent Doppler shift must be included in the exponent of the Gaussian
describing the Doppler broadening in the Voigt convolution of the absorp-
tion cross section α(ν, Ti) (Eq. (B.1)). The latter becomes explicitly position
dependent and takes the form

where we have also included position dependence if the local thermal equi-
librium temperature (Eq. (63)). This variation of the ion temperature with
position is the major complication to calculation of the full absorption S(ν) =
d3rρi(r)α(ν, Ti, r). But by replacing Ti(r) with the average ion temperature
d3r Ti(r) [54], and utilizing the spherical symmetry
in the plasma, Ti,ave =

of the plasma, the integral over space can be evaluated, and the ion temper-
ature can be replaced with an eﬀective ion temperature (Ti,eﬀ). The result is
Eq. (12) in Section 2.2.2. One can analytically show that for a time t after

(B.4)
The characteristic plasma expansion time is τexp from Eq. (25). This enables
a clear and well-deﬁned analysis of the data, such as shown in Fig. 25. In
principle, it also separates the various contributions to the Doppler broadening
of the spectrum, although the expansion energy typically becomes an order of
magnitude greater than the thermal energy, making quantitative measurement
of the thermal energy diﬃcult at later times. One can also consider comparison
of Eqs. (12) and (B.4) with data as a check of the self-similar expansion model
(Eq. (24)).

References [54] and [71] numerically justify approximate expressions relating
Ti,eﬀ to Ti,ave, Te(0), time, and other physical parameters when the ion tem-
perature is not assumed to be constant.

C The Quasineutral Approximation

The assumption of quasineutrality constitutes a central part for the theoretical
description and the analysis of ultracold plasma experiments. The condition of
ρi) implies a well deﬁned
approximately equal electron and ion densities (ρe ≈
charge separation, but this fact often causes confusion and is rarely discussed
in the literature. We provide a more detailed discussion of its physical meaning
in this section.

with ρalpha =

time to propagate the phase space densities according to eqs.(C.1) and (C.2).
However, the Vlasov equations could be used alternatively to calculate the
electrostatic potential, while the Poisson equation determines the total charge
density in this case. To do this we consider the hydrodynamic velocities

For isotropic, thermal velocity distributions the pressure tensors

Pα = kBTαρα. Since the time evolution of the hy-
simple scalar ﬁelds given by
drodynamic velocities and the pressure tensors follows from the self-consistent
solution of the Vlasov equations this expression is completely equivalent to
the Poisson equation (C.3). While the ﬁrst term in Eq. (C.5) describes lo-
cal charge imbalances between the two species, the second term arises solely
from the thermal pressure of the particles. The latter only vanishes for the
me Pe, and, hence, yields a ﬁnite contribution to
unlikely special case of
the electrostatic potential in general. On the other hand, the ﬁrst can be ne-
glected within the quasineutral approximation, requiring almost equal charge
ρe and ui = ue. Thus the electrostatic

Abstract. Studies of the long-range interactions between cold atoms and surfaces are now
of vital interest. The interest is partly driven by nanotechnology applications, partly by
the exploding interest in the encompassing superﬁeld of Casimir eﬀects, and partly by the
burgeoning overlap between atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter, and quantum
optics. This tutorial lecture will address long-range atom-surface interactions for cold atoms,
including an overview of Casimir-Polder interactions and their various manifestations. Some
previous theoretical studies that are of particular relevance will be reviewed. In addition some
diﬀerent approaches to the problem and corresponding results, especially concerning the eﬀects
of substrate composition, geometry, and ﬁnite temperature, will be discussed.

1. Introduction
The interactions between atoms and surfaces are important in many areas of physics.
Consequently, the literature is extensive and broad. In this tutorial, I will focus primarily on
the long-range atom-surface interactions relevant to the atomic, molecular, and optical physics
of cold atoms near surfaces. I will introduce the short-range Lennard-Jones potential and the
long-range retarded Casimir-Polder potential, discuss the accurate calculation of the interaction
coeﬃcients and the calculation of the potentials for distances that are not too close to the
surfaces, and the inclusion of real surface properties, such as dielectric response and temperature.
The paper will cover theoretical aspects. A number of recent experiments were presented at the
Conference on Atoms and Molecules near Surfaces, see the papers in the present volume, and
Refs. [1, 2].

The interaction potential between a ground state atom and a perfectly conducting wall is

V (R) = −C3R

−3

,

where R is the distance between the atom and the wall, C3 is the Lennard-Jones coeﬃcient, and
atomic units are used throughout (except when it is useful to exhibit ¯h and the speed of light c).
The interaction between polarizable systems is mediated by the exchange of virtual photons1
and as the separation of the systems increases there is a characteristic change in the interaction
energy between them. In 1948, Casimir and Polder showed with quantum electrodynamics that
for an atom interacting with a perfectly conducting wall the potential is [3]

V (R) = − 3

8π ¯hcαd(0)R−4,

R → ∞,

1 The resonant interaction between a ground state atom and an excited state atom, e.g. a Na(3s) atom and a
Na(3p) atom, will not be considered here.

(2)

where αd(0) is the static electric dipole polarizability of the atom. Subsequent to Casimir and
Polder, the result (2) has been obtained by many other investigators, see, for example, the
comprehensive treatments in Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

The appearance of ¯h and c and the weaker interaction (higher inverse power of R) are
signatures of the Casimir-Polder potential. To understand the interaction potential (2) it
is convenient to begin with a simple derivation of the retarded potential between two ﬁnite,
polarizable systems that gives the correct expressions up to numerical constants. I follow the
simple physical approaches presented in Refs. [11, 12, 13]; other approaches can be found in
Refs. [14] and [15].

Suppose that the two polarizable systems (either might be one of atom, electron, ion, or wall)
are in the presence of a uniform background (vacuum) ﬁeld Eb(ω). The interaction energy of
the two systems is given by

2
U (ω, R) ∼ α1(ω)[E2→1(ω, R) + Eb(ω)]

+ 1 ↔ 2,

where the second term signiﬁes the interchange of system 1 and system 2 in the ﬁrst term and
at large distances the electric ﬁeld at system 1 coming from system 2 is

where the electric dipole moment is

and the dynamic electric dipole polarizability is

E2→1(ω, R) ∼ eiRω/c ω2

p2(ω),

p2(ω) = α2(ω)Eb(ω)

α(ω) =

with fu the oscillator strength of state u and Eu − E0 the transition frequency between the
states u and 0. Note that the “sum” in eq. (6) includes a sum over all discrete transitions and
an integration over the continuum.

To obtain the R-dependent interaction energy, we retain only the cross terms in eq. (3) giving

U (ω, R) ∼ α1(ω)E2→1(ω, R)Eb(ω) ∼ α1(ω)α2(ω)E2

Summing over modes of the background ﬁeld, replacing

b(ω)
with ¯hω/V, and cutting oﬀ the integration at the highest relevant characteristic frequency, a
simple integral expression for the potential is obtained [11]

This useful formula, eq. (8), can reproduce the asymptotic Casimir-Polder potentials for
various cases such as the interaction between two atoms or between and atom and a wall; its
range of validity can be extended [16, 13]. In treating the asymptotic potential using eq. (8), we
make the replacement α(ω) → α(0). For example, the retarded Casimir-Polder potential between
two atoms is, according to eq. (8), U (R) ∼ ¯hcα1(0)α2(0)R−7 in agreement with Casimir and
Polder [3] who obtained

U (R) = − 23

4π ¯hcα1(0)α2(0)R−7, R → ∞,

Spruch and Kelsey [11] showed how eq. (8) can reproduce the atom-wall interaction. Let the
wall be approximated by a sphere of radius CR, where C is a number less than one, perhaps
around 1
4 , so that the systems are separated by a total distance R + CR = R(1 + C). Then
the polarizability of the sphere (wall) is (CR)3, which when substituted into eq. (8) with the
replacement of R by R(1 + C) (reasonable since C ≪ 1) yields,

V (R) ≈ C

αd(0)¯hcR

3

−4

,

in agreement with eq. (2).

Can an expression more precise than eq. (10) for the coeﬃcient in the asymptotic atom-wall
interaction potential be obtained simply by integrating the asymptotic atom-atom potential
eq. (9) over all the atoms constituting the wall? The calculation was carried out in Ref. [17]
with the result

V (R) ≈ − 69

160π ¯hcα(0)R−4,

which is about 15% larger than the result of Casimir and Polder, eq. (2). [A similar discrepancy
arises when the coeﬃcient C3 appearing in eq. (1) is estimated by integrating the R−6 van
der Waals interaction pairwise between an atom and each of the atoms in the wall [18].] The
overestimation of the actual interaction coeﬃcient is attributed to the non-additivity of long-
range dispersion forces—the pairwise treatment does not account for three-body and higher-
order interactions. The treatment of walls will considered in sections 3 and 4 below.

2. Coeﬃcients
We now leave the Casimir-Polder potential until section 3 and consider the accurate evaluation
of the Lennard-Jones atom-wall interaction potential eq.(1) for separations suﬃciently large that
the exchange energy of the overlap between the atomic and surface wave functions (cf. [19]) is
not important. For a perfectly conducting wall, the coeﬃcient C3 can be written as

or, from direct integration of eq. (12), as

C3 =

where |0i is the wave function of the atom, Ne is the number of electrons, and ri is the position
vector from the nucleus to electron i.

The C3 coeﬃcients can be calculated in many ways, including ab initio methods [20, 21],
density functional theory (DFT) [22], and semiempirical methods [23, 18, 19, 24]. For H, the
value of C3 is 1
4 [25]. Accurate values of C3 have been obtained using ab initio non-relativistic
methods for Li [21] and He(2 3S) [20] and for the heavy alkali-metal atoms (Na, K, Rb, Cs, and
Fr) using relativistic many-body perturbation theoretic methods [26, 27]. The most accurate C3
values for some systems of interest for cold atom studies are summarized in Table 1.

Estimates of C3 with eq. (12) using a single oscillator strength in eq. (6) can be inaccurate.
For Li the value of C3 is about 1.518 [21], but the value obtained using just the resonance
transition is only 1.45, an underestimate of 4.5%. For Cs, the value of C3 is about 4.45 [27], but
the value obtained using just the resonance transition is 2.59, an underestimate of 42%. The
discrepancy can be traced back to the contribution of the atomic core electrons, see eq. (13) [26].
Another way to see the origin of the discrepancy is to consider eq. (12), which is an integral
from 0 < ω < ∞. Recall that for high frequencies,

αd(iω) ∼

fu/ω

= Ne/ω

indicating that a representation of α(iω) that only includes the valence electron excitations
(Ne = 1) will not have the proper high-frequency tail, thereby leading to an inaccurate C3
coeﬃcient from the integral in eq. (12). We ensured that a semi-empirical calculation of C3 for
Na [24] included the contribution of the (ionic) core electrons by requiring the oscillator strength
distribution to satisfy the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule. A related argument concerning
inclusion of all virtual excitations was presented by Barton [28], who showed that a two-level
atomic model is inadequate to describe energy shifts of an atom near a wall.

3. Ideal walls
For an atom and a perfectly conducting wall, an expression for the potential that is valid from
small R to asymptotically large R is available [3, 29, 30],

VAtM (R) = −

and the subscript AtM denotes the atom-metal wall interaction [30], with αfs the ﬁne structure
constant. Eq. (15) has the unretarded result eq. (1) as its limit for small R and the Casimir-
Polder result eq. (2) as its limit for large R.

For a wall with a dielectric constant ǫ, the potential can be written [29, 30]

and the subscript D denotes the dielectric wall.

Accurate Lennard-Jones coeﬃcients and dynamic dipole polarizabilities for He(2 3S) have
been used,
for example, to theoretically analyze matter wave interference in an atomic
trampoline [31], for a comparison to the experimental results of atomic diﬀraction from a silicon
nitride grating [32], and in analysis of quantum reﬂection of atoms oﬀ of a ﬂat polished Si
surface [33].

For a ﬁxed dielectric constant, C3 is reduced by the factor [(ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 1)], as is evident in ﬁg. 1.
A similar expression describes the reduction of the Casimir-Polder asymptotic potential for a
dielectric wall [29].

4. Beyond ideal
Thus far, the consideration of the atom has been limited to the electric dipole polarizability
and the surface has been considered to be either a perfect conductor or a material with a ﬁxed
dielectric constant. Actual surfaces could consist of real metals or dielectrics with frequency
dependent properties, possess a nonzero surface temperature, have geometries deviating from a
plane, and consist of layers of substrates. Also of interest is the consideration of higher electric
multipoles or magnetic interactions and the treatment of an atom in an excited state or of a
molecule. We now address these issues.

4.1. Finite temperature and frequency-dependent dielectric constant
Expressions for the atom-wall interaction, for a wall at ﬁnite temperature, valid at all but very
short distances are available, cf. [34, 5, 35, 36, 10, 37].
In considering ﬁnite temperature, a
new distance scale appears, the thermal de Broglie wavelength ¯hc/kBT of the photons. More
formally, the energy in each photon ﬁeld mode is replaced by the the energy including the
thermal photons

1

2 ¯hck → 1

2 ¯hck + ¯hck[exp(¯hck/kBT ) − 1]−1.

The expression for the atom-wall potential at ﬁnite temperature accordingly involves a
Matsubara summation over frequencies, cf. [38].
In the classical limit of high temperature,
where the real photons dominate the virtual photons, the atom-wall potential becomes

(21)

(22)

V (R, T ) ∼ −

kBT αd(0)/R

3

,

1
4

and note the absence of ¯h. Spruch [39] has shown that the classical limit RT ∼ ∞ simply arises
from the replacement of 1
2 ¯hkc by kBT . This replacement combined with arguments similar to
those leading to eq. (8), where we replaced E2
b (ω) with ¯hω/V to account for virtual photons,
would lead to the essential properties of eq. (22), see also Ref. [40]. For a dielectric material
eq. (22) is diminished by the factor [(ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 1)] [10].

For surface temperatures of 300 K, evaluations of the interaction potentials for small distances
are available for He(2 3S) or Na atoms and an Au, Si, or SiO2 wall [37] and evaluations for large
distances are available for He(2 3S), Na, or Cs atoms and an Au wall [36], and Rb atoms and a
sapphire surface [10]. In addition, there is study of the interaction potential of H atoms near an
Ag surface [35].

One ingredient of these calculations that I have not covered in this tutorial is the frequency
dependent dielectric constant ǫ(iω)—another topic with a vast literature. The reader is referred
to Refs. [10] and [37], respectively, for example treatments of the ǫ(iω) function of sapphire and
Au.

Figure 2. Accurate values of the
dimensionless correction factor to
the Casimir-Polder energy, eq. (2),
for a He(2 3S) atom and a gold wall
at 300 K [36].

The evaluation of the atom-wall potential at ﬁnite temperature for a real wall is illustrated in
ﬁg. 2, where the dimensionless multiplicative correction factor to the Casimir-Polder potential is
plotted for a He(2 3S) atom and a Au wall at 300 K [36]. The factor is the ratio of the atom-wall
potential to the asymptotic Casimir-Polder potential of eq. (2), − 3
8π ¯hcαd(0)R−4. The linear
dependence of the correction factor at small R indicates the Lennard-Jones potential eq. (1) is
a good approximation and the linear dependence of the correction factor at large R indicates
that the classical potential tail eq. (22) is a good approximation. The roughly ﬂat behavior for
separations between 1 and 3 microns indicates the applicability of the Casimir-Polder potential,
eq. (2).

4.2. Surface roughness and layers
Surface roughness eﬀects on the interaction of an atom and a wall have been considered, cf.
Refs. [5, 41, 42]. The interaction of an atom with a substrate consisting of mutiple layers was
investigated in Ref. [8]. For thin layers, the power law describing the potential is predicted to
be non-integer for certain cases, cf. Refs. [43] and [35].

4.3. Higher multipoles
In addition to the long-range potential arising from the induced electric dipole moment eq. (1),
there is an induced quadrupole moment. The interaction potential will be weaker and is expected
to drop oﬀ as the inverse ﬁfth power. Some expressions and evaluations of coeﬃcients are
available in the literature, cf. Ref. [44].

4.4. Molecules
Studies of the interactions of diatomic molecules with surfaces along the lines of recent work with
atoms is of interest, as advances in ultra-cold molecule science are continuing [45]. There will be
two independent components for a diatomic molecule, similarly to a P -state atom interacting
with a surface [2]. Theoretical expressions and evaluations of molecule-surface interaction
coeﬃcients treating the asymmetric part were given in Refs. [46, 47, 48, 22].

5. Other aspects
In the study of atom-wall interactions the surfaces are usually empirically described. Further
developments might lead to ab initio calculation of surface material properties and atomic
properties simultaneously, perhaps with density functional theory [22] or path-integral
methods [49] Another intriguing area of research is the repulsive Casimir force, which occurs
in the interaction between a ﬂuctuating electric dipole moment and a ﬂuctuating magnetic
moment [50].

Nonlinear relativistic ionization phenomena induced by a strong laser radiation with elliptically
polarization are considered. The starting point is the classical relativistic action for a free electron
moving in the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by a strong laser beam. The application of the relativis-
tic action to the classical barrier-suppression ionization is brieﬂy discussed. Further the relativistic
version of the Landau-Dykhne formula is employed to consider the semiclassical sub-barrier ioniza-
tion. Simple analytical expressions have been found for: (i) the rates of the strong-ﬁeld nonlinear
ionization including relativistic initial and ﬁnal state eﬀects; (ii) the most probable value of the
components of the photoelectron ﬁnal state momentum; (iii) the most probable direction of pho-
toelectron emission and (iv) the distribution of the photoelectron momentum near its maximum
value.

I. INTRODUCTION

Relativistic ionization phenomena induced by strong laser light have become a topic of current interest [1–8]. In
the nonrelativistic theory it is assumed that the electron velocity in the initial bound state as well as in the ﬁnal state
is small compared with the speed of light. However, the electrons may be accelerated up to relativistic velocities in
an intense electromagnetic ﬁeld produced by modern laser devices. If the ponderomotive energy of the electron is
of the order of the rest energy a relativistic consideration is required. Relativistic eﬀects in the ﬁnal states become
important for an infrared laser at intensities of some 1016W cm−2. The minimal intensity required for relativistic
eﬀects increases by two orders of magnitude for wavelength corresponding to visible light.
Ionization phenomena
connected with relativistic ﬁnal state eﬀects have been studied for the cases of linearly and circularly polarized laser
radiation both in the tunnel [6,8] and above-barrier regimes [1,2,7]. The main relativistic eﬀects in the ﬁnal state are
[1,2,5–8]: (i) the relativistic energy distribution and (ii) the shift of the angular distribution of the emitted electrons
towards the direction of propagation of incident laser beam. It has been shown that a circularly polarized laser light
produces a large amount of relativistic electrons [1,2,8]. On the contrary, it has been found that the ionization rate
for relativistic electrons is very small in the case of linear polarization [6].

Relativistic eﬀects have also to be taken into account if the binding energy Eb in the initial state is comparable
with the electron rest energy [3,4]. A relativistic formulation is necessary for the ionization of heavy atoms or singly
or multiply charged ions from the inner K-shell. In Refs. [3,4] the relativistic version of the method of imaginary time
has been employed to calculate the ionization rate for a bound system in the presence of intense static electric and
magnetic ﬁelds of various conﬁgurations. Analytical expressions have been found which apply to nonrelativistic bound
systems as well as to initial states with an energy corresponding to the upper boundary of the lower continuum.

The present paper is aimed to consider the nonlinear photoionization connected with relativistic ﬁnal states velocities
and/or low lying initial states from a unique point of view. Further the current work extends the investigation of
relativistic ionization phenomena to the case of arbitrary elliptical polarization.

Certainly this may be done in the framework of the so-called strong ﬁeld approximation [9]. In the papers of Reiss
and of Crawford and Reiss [1,2,7] a relativistic version of this approximation has been given for the ionization of an
hydrogen atom with linearly and circularly polarized light. Within this approximation one calculates the transition
amplitude between the initial Dirac state for the hydrogen atom and the ﬁnal state described by the relativistic Volkov
wave function. Coulomb corrections are neglected in the Volkov state. Therefore the ﬁnal results are obtained only
within exponential accuracy. Analytical results for the ionization rate applying to above barrier cases as well as to
tunneling cases have been given in Refs. [1,2,7]. However, the corresponding expressions are complicated and contains
inﬁnite sums over all multiphoton processes. Numerical calculations are needed to present the ﬁnal results.

In contrast to the more sophisticated investigations, such as the solution of the Dirac equation or the strong ﬁeld
approximation, we are aimed to obtain simple analytical expressions. From our ﬁnal formulas the explicit dependence
of the ionization rate and of the photoelectron spectrum on the parameters, such as binding energy of the atom, ﬁeld
strength, frequency and ellipticity of the laser radiation may be understood without the need of numerical calculations.
In this sense our approach resembles that of Popov et al. [3,4] and of Krainov [6,8].

II. RELATIVISTIC ACTION AND CLASSICAL BARRIER-SUPRESSION IONIZATION

Let us start with the classical relativistic action for an electron of charge e moving in the ﬁeld of an electromagnetic

Quantum eﬀects may be neglected, for strong enough ﬁelds, i.e., F

0 /4Z (in a.u., where E0 is the
electron energy in the initial state and Z is the eﬀective charge of the atomic core). In this case the ionization process
may be described by an electron trajectory given in Eqs. (4). In a pure classical task the constants of motion may
be determined from the initial velocity and position of the electron at the beginning of the laser action. However,
the initial state is given by quantum mechanics. According to a simple classical picture of ionization, the barrier
supression ionization (BSI) [12], the transition occurs from the bound state to that continuum state which has zero
velocity at the time t with the phase ξ of the vector potential A(ξ). From this condition we have to choose the
constants as

The maximal ionization rate occurs at the maximum of the electric ﬁeld of the laser radiation. For our choice of the
gauge (see Eqs. (3)) the electric ﬁeld has its maximum at the phase ξ = 0. (For the sake of simplicity we neglect
the second maximum at ξ = π). From Eqs. (5) we conclude that the most probable ﬁnal state is described by the
constants

wave (g2 = 1). According to the classical barrier-supression ionization model the photoelectrons are emitted with a
relativistic drift momentum [12] at these laser intensities and for suﬃciently large ellipticity g . On the contrary, in
the case of linear polarization the photoelectrons have a zero drift momentum.

III. RELATIVISTIC SEMICLASSICAL APPROACH

Consider now the process of nonlinear ionization of a strongly bound electron with a binding energy Eb comparable
with the rest energy. Recently the ionization process in static crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds has been considered
[3,4]. The results of this paper may be applied to the ionization in laser ﬁelds only for the case of very strong ﬁelds
ǫ
1. With an increasing frequency of the laser light (especially for a tentative x-ray laser) very high laser intensities
are required to satisfy this condition. Therefore it is necessary to generalize the result of [3,4] to the case of nonzero
frequencies. We consider the sub-barrier ionization. The condition to be satisﬁed is the opposite to the case of pure
Eb. No restrictions are applied
FB, in addition we have the quasiclassical condition ¯hω

to the parameter ǫ. Thus we will cover both the regime of relativistic tunnel and multiphoton ionization.

and the relativistic adiabatic parameter η = ǫ−1 = ωmc/eF . Eq. (9) together with Eqs. (2) and (11) expresses
the transition rate between the initial state and the ﬁnal Volkov state with abitrary momentum within exponential
accuracy. It applies for the case of sub-barrier ionization with elliptically polarized laser light.

We are now interested in the total ionization rate. Within exponential accuracy it suﬃces to ﬁnd the maximum of
the transition rates between initial state and all possible ﬁnal states. Aquivalently, one has to ﬁnd the minimum of
the imaginary part of the action as a function of the ﬁnal state momentum. The minimization of the imaginary part

[13]

From these conditions we obtain that the most probable ﬁnal state is characterized by the parameters

The magnitudes α and λ0 has to be taken as the solution of Eqs. (11) and (13). Further γ = √2mEbω/eF is the
common adiabatic Keldysh parameter from nonrelativistic theory [5]. Equation (16) is the most general expression
for the relativistic ionization rate in the quasiclassical regime and for ﬁeld strength smaller than the above-barrier
threshold. It describes both the tunnel as well as the multiphoton ionization. It is the relativistic generalization of
previous nonrelativistic results [13].

a plane wave [15]. In contrast to that we deal here with the ionization of an atom being in rest in the laboratory
system of coordinates. Nevertheless, the “vacuum” limit should be considered only as the limiting result of the
present semiclassical approach where the eﬀects of pair production have been neglected. The polarization of the
vacuum becomes important if the binding energy of the atom exceeds the electron rest energy. At the binding energy

It has been shown that there is an enhancement of ionization rate in the relativistic theory for both large and small
η. This should be compared with the results found by Crawford and Reiss. In their numerical calculations they also
found an enhancement of relativistic ionization rate for a circularly polarized ﬁeld and for η

their results suggest a strong reduction of the ionization probability [2]. For the case of linearly polarized light the
ionization rate is found to be reduced by relativistic eﬀects [7]. However, Crawford and Reiss studied the above-barrier
ionization of hydrogen atom within the strong-ﬁeld approximation. In contrast to that we have investigated the sub-
barrier ionization from a strongly bound electron level, which yields an enhancement of the ionization rate. This
enhancement is connected with a smaller initial time t0. As a result the under barrier complex trajectory becomes
shorter and the ionization rate increases in comparison with the nonrelativistic theory. Figure 1 shows the relativistic
ionization rate Eq. (16) and the nonrelativistic Keldysh formula as a function of the binding energy eb and for the
case of linear polarization. The ﬁgure should be considered only as an illustration of the enhancement eﬀect. The
frequency and intensity parameters used for the calculations are still not available for the experimentalists.

IV. RELATIVISTIC PHOTOELECTRON SPECTRUM

Consider now the modiﬁcations of the energy spectrum induced by relativistic eﬀects. First we will characterize the
most probable ﬁnal state of the ejected electron. The classical nonrelativistic barrier-supression ionization predicts
a nonzero leaving velocity of the photoelectron. However, relativistic eﬀects as well as frequency corrections modify
this result of the classical BSI picture. In the relativistic semiclassical theory employed in this paper we may set the
constants a1 = 0 and a2 = (g/η)(sinhλ0/λ0) according to Eqs. (14) and (15). From Eqs. (4) we obtain then for the

nonrelativistic limit, whereas the z-component has a nonzero nonrelativistic limit. For a nonrelativistic atom, we get:

It follows from these equations that a strongly bound electron has a relativistic emission velocity along the direction
1, the emission velocity along the beam propa-
of the laser beam propagation. For a nonrelativistic initial state, εb ≪
gation is small. Nevertheless, the mean emission velocity seems to be the most sensitive measure of the appearance of
relativistic eﬀects in the initial states. In Fig. 2 the x-component of the leaving velocity is plotted versus the binding
energy of the initial state. Though we have choosen the same parameters of the laser beam as in Fig. 1 it should be
mentioned that the dependence of the emission velocity x-component on the laser parameters is rather weak. The
main parameter determining the leaving velocity along the propagation of the laser beam is the binding energy of the
atom.

From Eqs. (13)-(15) we also obtain the most probable value for each component of the ﬁnal state drift momentum
(which is the full kinetic momentum minus the ﬁeld momentum). We put a1 = py,m/mc, a2 = pz,m/mc and

From Eqs. (38)-(40) we easily obtain the most probable angle of electron emission. Denote by θ the angle between
the polarization plane and the direction of the photoelectron drift motion; and by ϕ the angle between the projection
of the electron drift momentum onto the polarization plane and the smaller axis of the polarization ellipse. In the
case of a nonrelativistic atom the most probable angles read

We conclude that relativistic eﬀects produce a nonzero component of the mean electron drift momentum along the
axis of beam propagation. As a result the mean angle of electron emission is shifted to the forward direction.

However, in the case of linear polarization the appearance of a nonzero x-component of the photoelectron drift
momentum is connected with relativistic eﬀects in the initial state. The latter are typically small except the case
of ionization from inner shells of heavy atoms. Notice that for the nonrelativistic atom the most probable value for
the drift momentum components as well as the expression for the peak of the angular distribution coincide with the
corresponding expressions within the BSI model (see Sec. II) if one neglects the frequency corrections.

where W tunnel is the total ionization rate Eq. (19) in the weak relativistic tunnel regime. In Eq. (46) only the leading

The ﬁrst exponent in Eq.(46) describes the momentum distribution in the plane perpendicular to the major axis of
the polarization plane. In the nonrelativistic theory (ǫ = 0) the width of the momentum distribution in px coincide
with the width of the pz distribution. The relativistic eﬀects (which are measured by ǫg) destroy this symmetry in
the (x,z)-plane. The distribution of px becomes broader, the pz distribution becomes narrower. We also mention
the appearance of a cross term proportional to the product δpxδpz which is absent in the nonrelativistic theory. In
Fig. 3 the distribution of the projection of the photoelectron drift momentum on the axis of the beam propagation
is shown. We consider electrons which are produced in the creation of Ne8+ (Eb = 239 eV) ions by an elliptically
1010 V/cm and ellipticity g = 0.707. The
polarized laser radiation with wave length λ = 1.054 µm, ﬁeld strength 2.5
relativistic momentum distribution is compared with the distribution of nonrelativistic theory. From the ﬁgure we
see that the main eﬀect is the shift of the maximum of the momentum distribution, the broadening remains small for
the parameters we have considered.

The ﬁrst term in the second exponent of Eq.(46) determines the nonrelativistic energy spectrum for the low energetic
electrons moving along the major polarization axis, whereas the second, relativistic term becomes important for the
high energy tail. A detailed analysis of the photoelectron spectrum will be given elsewhere [16].

In conclusion, in this paper relativistic phenomena for the ionization of an atom in the presence of intense elliptically
polarized laser light have been considered. The cases of relativistic classical above-barrier and semiclassical sub-barrier
ionization have been investigated. Simple analytic expressions for the ionization rate and the relativistic photoelectron
spectrum have been obtained. These expressions apply for relativistic eﬀects in the initial state as well as in the ﬁnal
state. We have shown that relativistic initial state eﬀects lead to a weak enhancement of the ionization rate in the
sub-barrier regime. The mean emission velocity has been shown to be a more sensitive measure for the appearance of
relativistic eﬀects in the initial state. The more important relativistic ﬁnal state eﬀects may cause a sharp increase
of the electron momentum projection along the propagation of elliptically polarized laser light. This results in a shift
of the most probable angle of electron emission to the forward direction.

Finally, the expressions obtained in this paper within exponential accuracy may be improved by taking into account
the Coulomb interaction through the perturbation theory. The results of this paper may be also used in nuclear physics
and quantum chromodynamics.

We report on the ﬁrst measurement of a temperature dependence of the Casimir-Polder force.
This measurement was obtained by positioning a nearly pure 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate a few
microns from a dielectric substrate and exciting its dipole oscillation. Changes in the collective
oscillation frequency of the magnetically trapped atoms result from spatial variations in the surface-
atom force. In our experiment, the dielectric substrate is heated up to 605 K, while the surrounding
environment is kept near room temperature (310 K). The eﬀect of the Casimir-Polder force is mea-
sured to be nearly three times larger for a 605 K substrate than for a room-temperature substrate,
showing a clear temperature dependence in agreement with theory.

The Casimir force and its molecular cousin, the van
der Waals force, are not only fascinating scientiﬁcally
but also important technologically, for example in atomic
force microscopy and MEMS. Like the tension in a rub-
ber band, the Casimir force is a conservative force aris-
ing from microscopic ﬂuctuations. The Casimir force
is also the dominant background eﬀect confounding at-
tempts [1, 2, 3, 4] to set improved limits on exotic forces
at the 10−8 m to 10−5 m length scale; progress towards a
deeper understanding is valuable in that context. Typi-
cally one uses “Casimir” [5] to refer to the force between
two bulk objects, such as metallic spheres or dielectric
plates, and “Casimir-Polder” (C-P) [6] to describe the
force between a bulk object and a gas-phase atom. The
underlying physics [7] is largely the same, however, and,
particularly in the limit of separations exceeding one mi-
cron, it can be more convenient to study the latter system
due to ease in rejecting systematic errors such as electro-
static patch potentials [8, 9].

The Casimir force arises from ﬂuctuations of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld and is usually thought of as being
purely quantum-mechanical. However, at nonzero tem-
peratures, the ﬂuctuations also have a thermal contri-
bution, which was investigated by Lifshitz [10]. Pre-
cise theoretical modeling of Casimir forces takes into
account eﬀects such as surface roughness, ﬁnite con-
ductivity, substrate geometry, and nonzero temperature,
but the latter term has never been unambiguously ob-
served experimentally (see [11] and references therein).
In earlier Casimir [4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and Casimir-
Polder [9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] experiments, thermal
eﬀects were predicted to be on the order of experimental
uncertainties or less because (a) the temperature of the
apparatus could not be varied over a large range and (b)
the experiments worked over small separations compared
to the wavelength of thermal radiation, where thermal
corrections are small.

In this Letter, we report the ﬁrst measurement of a

temperature dependence of the Casimir-Polder force, in-
deed the ﬁrst conclusive temperature dependence of any
Casimir-like system. A key feature of this work is that
the apparatus temperature is spatially nonuniform. This
allows for an experimental conﬁrmation of an appeal-
ing theoretical insight: The thermal electromagnetic-ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations that drive the C-P force can be separated
into two categories — those that undergo internal and
those that undergo external reﬂection at the surface.
These two categories of ﬂuctuations contribute to the
total force with opposite sign; in thermal equilibrium,
they very nearly cancel, masking the underlying scale of
thermal eﬀects. Working outside thermal equilibrium, we
observe thermal contributions to the C-P force that are
three times as large as the zero-temperature force.

To review the main regimes in surface-atom forces: For
a surface-atom separation x much less than the wave-
length of the dominant resonances in the atom and sub-
strate, the potential U scales as 1/x3 (van der Waals-
London regime). At longer distances, retardation eﬀects
cause a crossover to U ∼ 1/x4 (Casimir-Polder). At still
longer distances when x is comparable to the blackbody
peak at temperature T , temperature eﬀects become im-
portant, and in thermal equilibrium (T = TS = TE,
as deﬁned below), there is a second crossover, back to
U ∼ T /x3 (Lifshitz).

Recent theoretical work [24] has shown that thermal
corrections to the Casimir-Polder force are separable into
those arising from thermal ﬂuctuations within the sub-
strate at temperature TS [25] and those arising from ra-
diation impinging from presumed distant walls at an en-
vironmental temperature TE. At TS 6=0, electromagnetic
ﬂuctuations from within the surface have an evanescent
component that extends into the vacuum with maximum
intensity at the surface, giving rise to an attractive AC
Stark potential (Fig. 1).
Impinging external radiation
at TE reﬂects from the surface, giving rise to a stand-
ing wave whose intensity is at a minimum near the sur-

(a) Internal radiation striking the surface at angles less than
the critical angle θC does not contribute to the Casimir-Polder
force. However, internal radiation impingent at larger angles
(b) undergoes total internal reﬂection (c) and contributes to
an overall AC Stark shift by creating evanescent waves in free
space (d). Surrounding the atom (red circle) is radiation from
the environment (e) which contributes to the C-P force by cre-
ating standing waves at the surface. The force does not arise
from radiation pressure but rather from gradients in intensity.
The surface-atom force becomes more attractive for TS > TE
and more repulsive for TS < TE.

face. The Stark shift then pulls the atom away from
the surface, contributing a repulsive term to the poten-
tial [26]. Antezza et al. [24] recently predicted that the
nonequilibrium contribution to the C-P potential asymp-
totically scales as UN EQ ∼ (T 2
E)/x2. This novel
scaling dependence dominates at long range. One can
thus temperature-tune the magnitude of this long-range
force and, in principle, even change the sign of the overall
force.

S − T 2

We observe the temperature dependence of

the
Casimir-Polder force between a rubidium atom and a
dielectric substrate by measuring the collective oscilla-
tion frequency of the mechanical dipole mode of a Bose-
Einstein condensate (BEC) near enough to a dielectric
substrate for the C-P force to measurably distort the
trapping potential. This distortion of the trap results
in changes to the oscillation frequency proportional to
the gradient of the force:

where m is the mass of the 87Rb atom, and γx is deﬁned
as the fractional frequency diﬀerence between the un-
perturbed trap frequency ωo and ωx, the trap frequency
perturbed by the C-P force FCP .

The use of a BEC in this work is not conceptually cen-
tral. The force between the substrate and the condensate
is the simple sum of the force on the individual atoms of
the condensate. For our purpose, the condensate repre-

sents a spatially compact collection of a relatively large
number of atoms whose well-characterized Thomas-Fermi
density proﬁle facilitates the spatial averaging and the in-
clusion of nonlinear eﬀects in the oscillations, necessary
for the quantitative comparison between theory and ex-
periment [9, 27].

A detailed description of the experimental apparatus,
along with surface-atom measurement and calibration
techniques, appears in [8, 9, 28]. In brief, the experiment
consists of 2.5×105 87Rb atoms Bose-condensed (conden-
sate purity > 0.8) in the |F = 1, mF = −1i ground state.
The condensate is produced ∼1.2 mm below a dielectric
substrate by forced rf evaporation in a Ioﬀe-Pritchard-
style magnetic trap (trap frequencies of 229 Hz and 6.4
Hz in the radial and axial directions, respectively), re-
sulting in respective Thomas-Fermi radii of 2.69 µm and
97.1 µm.

The dielectric substrate studied consists of uv-grade
fused silica ∼ 2 × 8 × 5 mm3 in size (x, y, z directions,
respectively) sitting atop a monolithic pyrex glass holder
inside a pyrex glass cell which composes the vacuum
chamber (Fig. 2). The top surface (−ˆx face) of the sub-
strate is painted with a ∼100 µm thick opaque layer of
graphite and treated in a high-temperature oven prior to
placement in the vacuum chamber to prevent outgassing
and maintain ultrahigh vacuum standards for present
work.

The fused silica substrate was heated by shining ∼1 W
of laser light (860 nm) on the graphite layer. The rough
texture of the pyrex holder creates near point contacts
with the substrate corners, providing good thermal iso-
lation between the holder and the substrate. This tech-
nique allows us to vary the temperature of the substrate
while maintaining near room temperature vacuum cham-
ber walls and only slightly elevated holder temperatures.

schematic view of the Michelson interferometer used to non-
perturbatively measure the substrate temperature. As the
substrate heats, the glass both expands and changes its index
of refraction, creating an interferometric signal.

The temperature of the fused-silica substrate as a func-
tion of the heating laser power was determined in an
oﬄine calibration apparatus, constructed to be a near-
identical version of the main vacuum chamber, except
with improved optical access for a temperature probe
laser. The probe laser is coherently split between two
arms of a Michelson interferometer (Fig. 3). The result-
ing fringe shifts are proportional to changes in substrate
temperature. To test the robustness of the calibration
and the uniformity of the substrate temperature, the cal-
ibration was repeated several times as the details of the
alignment of the probe lasers and of the heating laser
were varied. A ﬁnite-element numerical model of the
thermal system agreed with our measurements and con-
tributed to our conﬁdence that the temperature of the
substrate and the environment were understood. Resid-
ual systematic uncertainties in temperature are reﬂected
in the error bars in Fig. 4(b).

The experiment, described in detail in [9], begins with
an adiabatic displacement of the atom cloud to a distance
x from the bottom surface (+ˆx face) of the substrate via
the addition of a vertical bias magnetic ﬁeld. The cloud
is then resonantly driven into a mechanical dipole oscilla-
tion by an oscillatory magnetic ﬁeld [29]. After a period
of free oscillation the relative position of the cloud is de-
termined by transferring the atoms to the anti-trapped
|F = 2, mF = −2i state via an adiabatic rapid passage.
The atoms fall rapidly away from the minimum of the
magnetic-trapping ﬁeld and are destructively imaged on
the |F = 2, mF = −2i → |F ′ = 3, mF ′ = −3i cycling
transition.

This process is repeated for various times in the free os-
cillation. The center-of-mass position is recorded at short
times to determine the initial phase of the oscillation and
at later times (∼1s) to precisely determine the oscilla-
tion frequency. Data is taken consecutively alternating
the trap center position between a distance x, close to
the surface, and a normalizing distance xo = 15 µm.
The distance xo is suﬃciently far from the substrate to

ment. (b) Average values of γx from (a) (for trap center to

avoid surface perturbations, yet close enough to provide
a local oscillator ωo with which the data taken at x can
be compared. Data sets are then taken at a number of
surface-atom positions (between 7–11 µm) and for vari-
ous substrate temperatures (between 310 and 605 K).

The results in Fig. 4(a) show the fractional change in
the trap frequency γx plotted as a function of the trap
center to surface position x. The blue squares show
the measured eﬀect of the room-temperature Casimir-

Polder force (TS=310(5) K) on the trap frequency. The
increase in the strength of the C-P force due to ther-
mal corrections becomes obvious when the substrate is
heated to 479(16) K (green circles) and even more pro-
nounced when it is at 605(16) K (red triangles). These
measurements were all done maintaining a room temper-
ature environment for which the pyrex vacuum chamber
walls were measured to be TE = 310(5) K. The curves in
Fig. 4(a) represent the theoretical predictions [24] for cor-
responding substrate-environment temperature scenar-
ios, showing excellent agreement with the measurements.
Each data point pictured represents the average of three
or four data sets taken at a given distance and tempera-
ture, while the error bars represent the total error in the
measurement (systematic and statistical).

For statistical clarity in data analysis, the average
value of γx can be computed for each substrate tempera-
ture (using trap center to surface positions 7.0, 7.5, and
8.0 µm only). These values, plotted in Fig. 4(b), clearly
show a signiﬁcant increase in the strength of the Casimir-
Polder force for hotter substrate temperatures; they also
distinguish the nonequilibrium theory curve (solid) from
the equilibrium (dash-dot), for which a much smaller
force increase is predicted.

Techniques described in previous work [9] demonstrate
the ability to diﬀerentiate the Casimir-Polder force from
spurious forces caused by electric and magnetic ﬁelds
from surface contaminants. These techniques were also
employed in this work for all three scenarios in Fig. 4(a),
none of which showed signiﬁcant surface contamination.
We can rule out that the measured increase in strength
of the C-P force comes from any of the following: an
increase in the dielectric constant with increasing tem-
perature, mechanical eﬀects on the atoms from the heat-
ing laser, thermal radiation from the substrate reﬂect-
ing from the vacuum chamber walls, or environment ra-
diation penetrating through the substrate from above.
One also must consider the quality of the blackbody ra-
diation emitted by the environment. While the pyrex
walls of the chamber are transparent at visible and near-
infrared wavelengths, at 5–10 µm wavelengths the walls
are opaque, with an emissivity > 0.8. The relatively large
surface area of the chamber walls, compared to that of
the substrate, also helps ensure that the environmental
radiation approaches the ideal 310 K spectrum.

In conclusion, we have made the ﬁrst measurement
discerning the temperature dependence of the Casimir-
Polder force and conﬁrmed the nonequilibrium theory of
Antezza et al. [24]. The strength of this force was shown
to increase by a factor of nearly three as the substrate
temperature doubles.

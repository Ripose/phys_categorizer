We present an eﬃcient and accurate grid method for solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger

equation of atomic systems interacting with intense laser pulses. As usual, the angular part of the

wave function is expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. Instead of the usual ﬁnite diﬀerence

(FD) scheme, the radial coordinate is discretized using the discrete variable representation which

is constructed from the Coulomb wave function. For an accurate description of the ionization

dynamics of atomic systems, the Coulomb wave function discrete variable representation (CWDVR)

method needs 3-10 times less grid points than the FD method. The resultant grid points of CWDVR

distribute unevenly so that one has ﬁner grid near the origin and coarser one at larger distances.

The other important advantage of the CWDVR method is that it treats the Coulomb singularity

accurately and gives a good representation of continuum wave functions. The time propagation of

the wave function is implemented using the well-known Arnoldi method. As examples, the present
method is applied to the multiphoton ionization of both H and H− in intense laser ﬁelds. Short-

time excitation and ionization dynamics of H by static electric ﬁelds is also investigated. For a

wide range of photon energies and laser intensities, ionization rates calculated using this method

are in excellent agreement with those from other theoretical calculations.

INTRODUCTION

With the fast advance of modern laser technologies, lasers of various frequencies at dif-

ferent intensities are routinely available in many laboratories [1]. Studies of the highly

nonlinear interaction of matters with strong laser pulses have revealed many interesting

physical and chemical processes [2]. New technologies based on these physical principles are

under fast development and new frontiers of sciences are being opened [3]. Newly developed

light sources have for the ﬁrst time enabled physicists and chemists to trace and image the

electronic motion within atoms and molecules on attosecond timescale [4].

However, multiple reactional paths and many-body nature inherent to these highly non-

linear and ultrafast processes contribute to the complexities of theoretical interpretations

to the experimental observations. High intensities of the applied lasers make any pertur-

bation theories no longer applicable. It is necessary to treat the Coulomb interaction and

the interactions from the laser ﬁelds on equal footing. Many theoretical methods have been

designed to describe diﬀerent kinds of phenomena. To mention just a few, these meth-

ods range from strong ﬁeld approximation [5], intense-ﬁeld many-body S-matrix theory [6],

R-matrix Floquet method [8], the generalized Floquet theory [7], time-dependent density

functional theory [9] and numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-

tion [10, 11, 12, 13]. Compared to other methods, the direct solution of the time-dependent

Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) has proved to be very versatile and fruitful in explaining and

predicting many experimental measurements for a wide range of laser parameters. Especially

when the laser pulse length approaches the few-cycle or sub-femtosecond regime, numerical

solution of TDSE becomes even more appropriate and eﬃcient.

Nevertheless, the accurate integration of the multi-dimensional TDSE is very computa-

tionally demanding. Even the most powerful supercomputer nowadays has only made the ab

initio integration of the two-electron atom possible [14]. Therefore, many approximate the-

oretical models such as reduced-dimension models and soft Coulomb potential models have

played an important role in understanding some of the important physical mechanisms un-

derlying the strong ﬁeld phenomena [15]. On the other hand, it is questionable to use these

models to simulate the realistic experiments quantitatively. For example, it was pointed out

that the dynamical motion in three dimensions is not merely a trivial extension of what

happens in two dimensions [16]. It was also shown that the physics of model systems using

2

the soft Coulomb potential is very sensitive to the softening parameters [17].

Therefore, in order to produce quantitatively correct results, it is necessary to solve TDSE

in its full dimensions and use the real Coulomb potential with its singularity treated prop-

erly [18]. This is especially crucial when the singularity plays an important role in the

problem at hand [16, 19].

It is the purpose of the present paper to present an accurate

and eﬃcient method to solve the TDSE for the multiphoton ionization of hydrogenic atom.

Unlike the usual ﬁnite diﬀerence (FD) discretization of the radial coordinate [10, 11], the

present method discretizes the radial coordinate using the discrete variable representation

(DVR) constructed from the positive energy Coulomb wave function. We show that the

Coulomb wave function DVR (CWDVR) is able to treat the Coulomb singularity naturally

and provide a good representation of continuum wave functions.

The other advantage of CWDVR is that it needs 3-10 times fewer grid points than

FD scheme because of the uneven distribution of the grid points, in which case one has a

coarser grid at larger distances where Coulomb potential plays a less important role and

wave functions oscillate less rapidly. Because the CWDVR is economic, it is a promising

step towards a more eﬃcient treatment of the many-electron systems which is extremely

demanding [14]. In addition, many strong ﬁeld processes, such as above threshold ionization

(ATI), high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and dynamical stabilization etc., can be well

understood within a single active electron (SAE) picture. Therefore, the hydrogenic atom

serves a prototype for spherically symmetrical atomic systems interacting with intense laser

ﬁelds.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we give the details of how

we construct the CWDVR, preceded by a brief introduction to the general DVR method.

We then present in section III how we apply CWDVR to discretize the TDSE for one-

electron atomic systems in intense laser ﬁelds. In section IV, we present some results for
the multiphoton ionization of H and H− as well as the short-time dynamics of H in a static

electric ﬁeld. We show that ionization rates calculated by the present economic and accurate

method are in excellent agreement with other theoretical calculations. Finally, we give a

short conclusion. Atomic units (a.u.) are used unless otherwise speciﬁed.

II. COULOMB WAVE FUNCTION DVR

The DVR method has its origin in the transformation method devised by Harris and

coworkers [20] for calculating matrix elements of complicated potential functions in a trun-

cated basis set. It was further developed by Dickinson and Certain [21] who showed the

relationship between the transformation method and the Gaussian quadrature rules for or-

thogonal polynomials. Light and coworkers [22] ﬁrst explicitly used the DVR method as a

basis representation for quantum problems rather than just a means of evaluating Hamil-

tonian matrix elements. Ever since then, diﬀerent types of DVR methods have found wide

applications in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physical and chemical problems [23]. There continues to be

many eﬀorts to construct new types of DVR and to apply DVR in the combination of other

numerical methods [24].

Essentially, DVR is a representation whose associated basis functions are localized about

discrete values of the coordinate. DVR greatly simpliﬁes the evaluation of Hamiltonian

matrix elements. The potential matrix elements are merely the evaluation of interaction

potential at the DVR grid points and no integration is needed. The kinetic energy matrix

elements can be calculated very simply and analytically in most cases [25]. In this section,

we ﬁrst give a short introduction to the DVR constructed from the orthogonal polynomials.

Then we present how we construct the DVR from the Coulomb wave function, which will

be used to solve the TDSE of atomic systems in intense laser ﬁelds in section III.

A. DVR Related to Orthogonal Polynomials

It is well known [25] that the DVR basis functions can be constructed from any orthogonal

polynomials, PN (x), deﬁned in the domain (a, b) with the corresponding weight function

ω(x). Let

of

PN (x) at xi. Apparently,

Ci(x) satisﬁes the cardinality condition

One can construct the DVR basis function fi(x) from the cardinal function

Ci(x) as

follows:

which, at the point xj, gives

We know that the integration of any function F (x) can be calculated using an appropriate

quadrature rule associated with the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials, i.e.:

Ci(xj) = δij.

where ωi is the corresponding weight at the point xi. From the theory of classical orthogonal

polynomials [27], the integration formula Eq. (7) is exact as long as the function F (x) can be

expressed as a polynomial of order 2N
the help of Eqs. (1), (3) and (5), it is easy to show that the function f ∗

i (x)fj(x) satisﬁes this

condition. Therefore, the following integration can be carried out exactly:

i (xk)fj(xk) = δij.

As a result of Eqs. (6) and (7), any local operator V (x) has a diagonal representation in

the DVR basis set as follows:

B. DVR Constructed from the Coulomb Wave Function

Following a similar spirit, we present the DVR basis function fi(r) which is constructed

from the Coulomb wave function. The Coulomb wave function (see, Eq. (14.1.1) of Ref. [28])

satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation

Following Schwartz [29], Dunseath and coworkers [30] constructed an appropriate quadra-

ture rule associated with the zeros ri of the Coulomb wave function (15). By using this

quadrature rule, the integration of a function F (r) over (0,

with the help of Eq. (20).

Note that Eq. (22) is satisﬁed approximately for the DVR basis functions constructed

from the Coulomb wave function, while Eq. (8) is satisﬁed exactly for the DVR basis func-

tions constructed from the orthogonal polynomial. Nevertheless, we will show later that

CWDVR can be applied to solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation very eﬃciently

and accurately.

In Eq. (32), the interaction Hamiltonian HI(r, t) describes the interaction of the active

electron with the applied laser pulse. In the laser parameters range of interest in the present

work, the dipole approximation is well justiﬁed. For a linearly polarized laser along the z

A. Discretization of the Spatial Coordinates

In order solve the TDSE (32), we need to discretize this equation. We expand the angular

part of the wave function in terms of spherical harmonics. The radial coordinate r can be

discretized in diﬀerent ways. The most straightforward one is to use the ﬁnite diﬀerence

method, in which case the ﬁrst and second derivative with respect to r in Eq. (33) are

approximated by formulas involving only several neighboring points. In the present work,

we expand the radial part of the wave function in CWDVR basis functions constructed

above. As seen from Eqs.( 30) and ( 31), CWDVR is a global method, in which case the

representations of the derivatives involve all the grid points.

1. Expansion of the Angular Part

given by Eq. (47) in the length gauge and by Eq. (49) in the velocity gauge. Although we

deal with the r coordinate using CWDVR in the present work, we still give the FD formulas

for the purpose of comparison. In the FD scheme, the grid points are chosen to be equal

and

In order to have give a better ground state energy, we have used the following approxima-

(53)

where C0 is a constant which depends on the grid spacing ∆r. For example, we take

1.48986 for ∆r = 0.2 and get a converged H ground state energy of

0.500000065

−

1.814116 for ∆r = 0.3 in order to get the same value of the ground state

C0 =

a.u., but C0 =

energy.

Apparently, one needs a very small spacing ∆r in order to have a good approximation

to these derivatives. For the atomic systems interacting with the intense laser pulses, the

electronic wave function can be generally driven to hundreds of or even thousands of atomic

unit away from the nuclear. Therefore, we need a very large number of the grid points.

Another disadvantage of the FD scheme is that, one needs to carefully deal with the Coulomb

singularity at the origin [11].

Now let us turn to discretize r using the CWDVR basis functions which we discussed in

the last section. As we mentioned before, the CWDVR has several advantages: ﬁrstly, it

deals with the singularity of the Coulomb-type potential at the r = 0 naturally; secondly,

the grid points (i.e., zeros of Coulomb wave function) are dense nearly the origin where the

Coulomb potential plays a crucial role and sparse at large distances where it is not very

important; thirdly, compared to FD scheme, much fewer grid points are needed for the same

extent of the grid because of the uneven distribution of the grid points.

The CWDVR basis functions fi(r) are given in Eqs. (17) , (18) and (22). Let us start

from Eq. (41) and expand ϕlm(r, t) in terms of fi(r) as follows:

ϕlm(r, t) =

Dilm(t)fi(r),

(54)

where the coeﬃcient is given by,

3. Distribution of the CWDVR Grid Points

The grid point ri of CWDVR is the solution of v(r) = 0 where v(r) is deﬁned by Eq. (15)

for any given energy E and nuclear charge Z. Therefore, the distribution of the CWDVR

grid points can be adjusted by the value of parameter Z and κ

√2E.

Z takes either 12 or 20. We list in this table the number of the grid points N (up to the

ﬁrst point which is greater than 150) and the value of the ﬁrst and the last grid point r1 and

rN . We also give three grid spacings ∆r0, ∆r15 and ∆r150 which correspond to the spacing

between the ﬁrst two points, the two points around 15 and the last two grid points.

One notices that the value of Z mainly determines the value of the ﬁrst grid point r1,

i.e., the greater Z is, the smaller r1 becomes. However, increasing the value of κ will mainly

decrease the spacing between the grid points at large r and thus one needs more grid points

for the same value of rmax = 150. At the same time, larger κ means much more even

distribution at larger distances. For example, ∆r15 and ∆r150 for κ = 5 diﬀer much less

than that for κ = 0.5.

For the same rmax = 150 a.u., one observes that the number of the grid points for CWDVR

cases is only 1/10 to 1/3 of that for FD case if we choose even spacing ∆r = 0.2 a.u.. As

we will discuss later, most of our results for the hydrogen are convergent for κ = 1.0 and

Z = 20 case where only 1/10 of the number of the grid points for FD is needed (N = 72 vs

N = 750).

B. Wave Function Propagation in Time

After the discretization of the spatial coordinates, one has to advance the evolution of

the initial wave function in discretized time. If the initial wave function one desires is the

electronic ground state, it can be computed by the propagation of any trial wave function in

imaginary time. The Schr¨odinger equation in imaginary time is mapped into the diﬀusion

equation.

In this case, any excited states will decay away faster than the ground state

since the latter has the lowest energy. Once the energy is adjusted to the true ground

state energy ε0, the asymptotic solution is a steady-state solution. One will thus obtain a

converged ground state energy and wave function on the spatial grids after a suﬃciently

long time of diﬀusion.

Concerning the propagation of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, there exist

many diﬀerent methods such as split operator [33], Chebychev polynomial expansion [34],

Taylor series [35] and Arnoldi/Lanczos method [36]. There have been a number of authors

who made a detailed comparison study of the eﬃciency and accuracy among diﬀerent propa-

gation schemes [37]. Although the choice of the propagation scheme depends on the internal

characteristics of the physical problem at hand, it is generally accepted that Arnoldi/Lanczos

method proves to oﬀer an accurate and ﬂexible approximation of the matrix exponentials

involved in the propagation of wave function for most practical applications (Note that

Arnoldi method can apply to nonsymmetric matrices, but Lanczos method only applies to

symmetric or Hermitian matrices).

In the Arnoldi/Lanczos method, the eigenvalue and eigenstate of a large matrix is ap-

proximated in the Krylov subspace spanned by the vectors

ψ0, Hψ0, H 2ψ0, ..., H mψ0}

{

for

the order m which is typically much smaller than the dimension of the Hamiltonian ma-

trix H itself.

In practice, we need to use Arnoldi/Lanczos algorithm [38] to generate m

orthonormal basis vectors Vm+1 in the Krylov subspace. At the same time, an upper Hes-

senberg matrix hm+1 is formed resulting from these processes. The eigenvalues of the original

large matrix are thus approximated by the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix of dimension

m + 1. Therefore, Arnoldi/Lanczos method is especially suitable for the large matrix and

multi-dimensional problems.

An extensive software package “Expokit” for the computation of matrix exponential was

developed by Sidje [39].

In this package, the author has provided several alternatives to

15

compute the matrix-valued function etH for small, dense complex matrices H. In addition,

“Expokit” has functions for computing etH ψ0 for both small, dense matrices and large, sparse

matrices.

In the present work, we have incorporated this software into our code for the accurate

propagation of the wave function for atomic systems interacting with strong laser pulses. In

each time step, we ﬁrst generate the orthonormal vectors Vm+1 and the upper Hessenberg

matrix hm+1 for the wave function Ψ(t) using the Arnoldi process. Then the exponential
of the upper Hessenberg matrix e−i∆thm+1 is carried out by the irreducible rational Pad´e

approximation combined with scaling-and-squaring. Finally, the wave function at the next

Ψ(t + ∆t) =

Ψ(t)

|

|

(59)

where

Ψ(t)

stands for the norm of the wave function at time t and e1 is the ﬁrst unit basis

|

|

vector [39].

For all the results presented in this paper, we use the Arnoldi order m = 30 and the

propagation time step ∆t = 0.01 a.u.. However, we ﬁnd that for some of the laser parameters

we consider, the results are already converged for much lower order of m (e.g., 12) and much

larger time step ∆t (e.g., 0.04 a.u.).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this section, we will present some numerical results for ionization of the hydrogen

atom by strong static electric ﬁelds and by intense laser ﬁelds. In order to illustrate that

our method can equally apply to any eﬀectively one-electron atomic system with a proper

SAE model potential, we have also calculated multiphoton detachment rates of the negative

hydrogen ion for several laser frequencies at diﬀerent intensities. Excellent agreements are

achieved between our results and the previous theoretical calculations.

For an accurate evaluation of the ionization rate for a particular laser intensity, the laser

pulse should ramp on adiabatically and keep constant for a suﬃciently long time. The laser

pulse ramping-on time must be large compared to the initial atomic orbital period of the

bound electron and thus the electron energy will adjust adiabatically to the rising intensity.

The constant-intensity time should also be suﬃciently long so that the frequency bandwidth

is small compared with the laser frequency. Only in this case, we can treat the laser ﬁeld as

16

monochromatic. Taking these into consideration, we take the vector potential A(t) of the

laser pulse having the following form:

without any reﬂection. It is extremely crucial to avoid any unphysical eﬀects induced by

the absorbing potential [40]. According to our experiences, we take 0.3

the time-dependent physical quantities, such as the population decay of the ground state,

values.

Of course, convergence has to be achieved against changing of other parameters such as

the largest quantum number of the angular momentum L, the number of grid points N in

A. Choice of Gauge and Convergence of the CWDVR Grid

Although diﬀerent gauges describing the interacting Hamiltonian HI(t) should in principle

lead to the same physical results, it is not true in practice because of diﬀerent approximations

and inaccurate numerical wave functions. For some approximate methods, length gauge

proves to be better than the velocity gauge in some circumstances [41]. However, as discussed

by Cormier and Lambropoulos [42], velocity gauge is preferable for some ab initio numerical

calculations. This is connected with the fact that the canonical momentum in the velocity

gauge has been reduced to a slowly varying variable since the momentum due to the strong

ﬁeld has been mainly removed [42]. In this case, we can avoid some widely varying variables.

Especially in the present case where the wave function is expanded in terms of the spherical

harmonics, much smaller L is needed for a converged result in the velocity gauge than that

needed in the length gauge.

In the present work, we have performed our results in the velocity gauge for H in laser
ﬁelds. However, length gauge is used for H in static ﬁeld and H− in laser ﬁelds. One of

the reasons for the latter choice is that it is easy for us to compare our results with the

previous results. Another reason, for H −, is that the angular-momentum-dependent model

potential [43] makes the form of the potential in the velocity gauge is not able to be obtained

obviously [44].

Since the CWDVR grid depends on the two parameters Z and κ, one has to make sure

that any calculation should be converged against changes of them. As shown in table I,

the CWDVR grid for smaller κ is much coarser. At the same time, the ﬁrst point of the

grid is mainly decided by the value of Z. It is expected that much ﬁner CWDVR grid will

have a better representation of the Coulomb potential and the wildly driven electronic wave

function by the laser ﬁeld.

In order to test the convergence of CWDVR grid, the multiphoton ionization of H for

an infrared laser at a moderate laser intensity serves as a good example. For a hydrogenic

atom, the potential is given by

VC(r) =

Z
r

−

(65)

where Z is the nuclear charge and equals to 1 for H. For the CWDVR grids we consider in

table I, we get the H ground state energy of

0.49999997 a.u. or better.

In ﬁgure 1, we present the natural logarithm of the population decay within a sphere of 25

a.u. of r calculated by the FD method and by the CWDVR grids corresponding to diﬀerent

Z and κ. With the wavelength λ = 780 nm and peak intensity I0 = 2

maximum number of angular momentum L is taken to be 20 for a converged calculation. In

N = 750 for the maximum value of the grid point rmax = 150. The corresponding number of

the r grid points used for CWDVR cases are indicated in table I. From ﬁgure 1, we conclude

that our results are indeed converged to the FD diﬀerence results as κ is increased from 0.5

to 2.0. Even for the coarsest case for κ = 0.5, in which case only 56 grid points are used,

the result is reasonably good. The ionization rate estimated from this curve is 4.63

κ = 2. We also observe that, for the present case, results are not very sensitive to changing

of the value of Z(for the same value of κ). However, we ﬁnd that, in most of the cases

that we consider later, Z = 20 is usually more preferable for its better representation of the

Coulomb potential near r = 0.

In practice, the ionization rate is ﬁtted by an exponential decay of the ground state

population or the decay of the total population within some sphere of r.

In the present

calculations, we have deﬁned an inner sphere and a middle sphere with radius rinn = 25 and

rmid = 50 a.u. respectively. The population remaining within these two spheres Pinn and

Pmid, together with the probability in the ground state Pgrd and the total population in the

whole box Pwhl, are recorded for each time time step. As an example, we show in ﬁgure 2

for the ionization of H at the laser frequency 0.6 a.u and peak intensity 4.375

tests of the present method by calculating the ionization rates of H for a large number of

wavelengths from very low to very high peak intensities.

For all the calculations presented here, we use the CWDVR grid for κ = 1.0 and Z = 20.

Therefore the number of grid point N is 72 with rmax = 151.39 a.u.. The maximum number

of angular momentum L = 10 gives converged results in all the cases for the velocity gauge

description of the interaction term. The parameters for the absorbing function (64) α and

σ are taken to be 0.4 and 4 respectively. In table II, we compare ionization rates calculated

using the present method with other theoretical results. We notice that our results agree

better with those of Chu and Cooper [45] by an ab initio Floquet calculations. However, the

present time-dependent method results are also in reasonable agreement with those TDSE

calculations of Ref. [47] using a complex Sturmian basis and those of Ref. [10] using a FD

method. The results of ω = 0.2 a.u. for intensities 1.75

less favorable agreement because high ionization rates lead to very fast decay of the ground

population and thus estimations from TDSE methods become less accurate.

In table III, we compare ours results with the benchmark calculations done by Chu and

Cooper [45] using the ab initio nonperturbative L2 non-Hermitian Floquet method. The

laser frequency ω vary from 0.6 to 0.18, which correspond to one- to three-photon ionization

Again, very good agreement are achieved for these wide ranges of laser parameters.

C.

Ionization of H by Static Electric Fields

Now let us turn to the ionization of H from the ground state by a static electric ﬁeld.

Excitation and ionization dynamics of atoms and molecules by static electric ﬁelds has been

of great importance since the foundation of quantum mechanics [48] and continues to be of

great interest of current study [49, 50, 51].

Although the long time behavior is dominated by the exponential decay of the ground

state of H, large deviations from the naive exponential decay are expected because of the

sudden turn-on of static electric ﬁeld. Actually, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian for this

system is unbounded from below. There are many resonances present. The deviation from

exponential decay is expected to be large for strong ﬁelds cases [51]. However, there is a

substantially long time of transitory region for weak and intermediate ﬁelds as well, whose

length depends on the particular ﬁeld strength.

In order to investigate this transitory regime, one has to make sure that the nonexpo-

nential decay indeed comes from physical dynamics rather than numerical reasons such as

nonconvergence of the grid or reﬂection of the wave function from the edge. This point is

extremely important for the static electric ﬁeld case where the wave packet is driven away

in one direction rather than in a oscillatory fashion as for a laser pulse case. In ﬁgure 3, we

show the logarithm of the ground state probability of H by a static electric ﬁeld F = 0.08

a.u.

for diﬀerent CWDVR grids. Note that we use the length gauge in this case for the

dipole interaction. The maximum of the grid rmax for all the cases is taken to be around 150

a.u. and the corresponding number of the grid points are listed in table I. We take Z = 20

for all the CWDVR grids. In addition, the absorbing function parameters α and σ are taken

to very extreme values of 0.25 and 0.4 respectively in order to avoid the reﬂection from the

edge. For this ﬁeld strength, we can get converged result only if κ > 4.0, which case the grid

is dense enough for a good representation of the interaction term using the length gauge.

Note that the performance of the present CWDVR is much better than the DVR method

used by Dimitrovski and coworkers [52], in which case the converged result is only achieved

for t

40. Therefore, one has be be very careful not to interpret the nonexponential decay

≈

for κ < 3.0 as any physical excitation and ionization dynamics [51].

Using the CWDVR κ > 4.0 and Z = 20, we have studied the short-time dynamics at

other ﬁeld strengths. In ﬁgure 4, we present the population decay of the ground state for

diﬀerent electric ﬁeld strength F . For the lowest ﬁeld strength F = 0.005 a.u., one observes

both a small- and large-time scale regular oscillation, which implies reversible processes.

For the case when F becomes 8 times of that in (a), we observe a quadratic decay in the

ﬁrst 8 a.u., followed by a irregular transition time before the system becomes stable after
10−6 a.u.). As

90 a.u. or so (it will be a very slow exponential decay afterwards, with Γ

∼

the ﬁeld strength increases further in (c) and (d), the transitory time becomes shorter and

shorter, which is followed by a purely exponential decay. The transitory regions are shown

by Durand and Paidarov´a [51] to directly related to the 2s-2p resonances by inspecting the

spectral density line-shape. Note that, the fast quadratic decay is present for (c) and (d) as

well when the ﬁeld is turned on.

It is remarkable to note that the present time-dependent calculations for the entire region

time-dependent calculations [13, 53].

D. Multiphoton detachment rates of H− by strong laser pulse

In order to show that the present method can equally apply to any atomic systems with

appropriate SAE model potential, we study the in this section the multiphoton detachment
of the negative ion of hydrogen. For H−, we use the angular-momentum-dependent model

Use this model potential, the ground state we get is

grids listed in table I, which is in very good agreement with the value

lated by Telnov and Chu [54] and with the experimental measurement

0.027716 a.u. [55].
In table V, we compare the total detachment rates of H− calculated from the present

method with other theoretical calculations. We get converged results of the CWDVR grid

for κ = 2 and Z = 20. It is not surprising that the requirement of the grid is less demanding
for H− case than for the H in static electric ﬁeld case since we have a short-range potential

here. For all the laser parameters considered in table V, we get very good agreement with

those results of Refs. [56] and [57, 58].

However, Telnov and Chu use the dipole moment r, which accounts for the slight diﬀer-

ences between their results and ours. We have tested our code with the latter dipole moment,

26

we get detachment rate to be 4.51

10−4 a.u. for 1064 nm at

coworkers [56], which are calculated by solving the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation

by the nonperturbative many-electron, many-photon theory (MEMPT). This might be due

to the fact that the dipole moment we use takes the core polarization eﬀects into account.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented an accurate and eﬃcient method of solving the time-dependent

Schr¨odinger equation. Compared to the usual FD discretization scheme of the radial co-

ordinate, the present CWDVR method needs 3-10 fewer number of grid points and treats

the Coulomb singularity naturally and accurately. As examples, our method has been very
successfully applied to the multiphoton ionization dynamics of both H and H−. The total

ionization rates estimated from the present method are in perfect agreement with other theo-

retical results. We have also applied our method to investigate the short-time excitation and

ionization dynamics of H in weak and strong static electric ﬁelds. The ground state survival

probability and the ionization rate calculated using the present method are in full agree-

ment with those results calculated by complex rotation method. Since the CWDVR treats

the Coulomb potential accurately and needs much fewer points in r coordinate, the present

methods opens the way to a more eﬃcient treatment of many-electron atomic systems.

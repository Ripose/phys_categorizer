Constrained Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Atomic Ground-States

(Dated: October 25, 2012)

Constrained molecular dynamics(CoMD) model, previously introduced for nuclear dynamics, has
been extended to the atomic structure and collision calculations. Quantum eﬀects corresponding
to the Pauli and Heisenberg principle are enforced by constraints, in a parameter-free way. Our
calculations for small atomic system, H, He, Li, Be, F reproduce the ground-state binding energies
within 3%, compared with the results of quantum mechanical Hartree-Fock calculations.

PACS numbers:

Molecular dynamics approach is a powerful tool to sim-
ulate nuclear heavy ion collisions and atomic collisions,
due to its simplicity and ability to take into account the
inﬂuence of correlations and ﬂuctuations. However in this
approach, one uses classical equations of motion. As it is
well known, truly classical atoms, without constraints of
the Heisenberg principle, are unstable. To describe the
ground-state properties of the systems with molecular
dynamics approach, the pseudo potential is often intro-
duced to simulate the eﬀects of the Heisenberg uncer-
tainty principle and the Pauli exclusion principles [1, 2].
Due to the pseudo potential, one can reproduce the bind-
ing energy of atoms and molecules with satisfactory ac-
curacy, by minimizing the energy of the system solv-
ing the classical equations of motion with a dissipative
term. The method with pseudo potential is known as
Fermion molecular dynamics(FMD) and it is applied to
the studies of various atomic processes, in which a quan-
tum mechanical dynamical simulation encounters prob-
lems diﬃcult to overcome. To give some actual examples,
the atom-ion collisions [3], the atomic ionization by laser
ﬁelds [4], the capture of muons by hydrogen atoms [5]
and the formation of antiprotonic atom [6], all these pro-
cesses have been investigated using molecular dynamics
approach.

Meanwhile, a constrained molecular dynamics (CoMD)
approach has been proposed to treat fermionic properties
of the nucleons in nuclei [7] recently. The approach has
been successfully applied to study the Equation of State
of the quark system as well [8].
In this approach, the
manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle is accom-
plished by controlling the phase space occupancy. The
constraint of CoMD approach is thought as an alterna-
tive of the pseudo potential and can be easily extended to
the case of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as well.
The constraints play the role of a “dissipative term” in
the classical equation of motion and lead the systems to
its ground-states. But at variance with FMD approaches,
the “dissipative term” can increase or decrease the energy
of the system depending on the phase space occupation.
In this brief report, we apply CoMD to atomic sys-
tems for the purpose of determining their ground-states
conﬁgurations. Particularly, we discuss some properties
of ground-states atoms, i.e., binding energies (the total
electronic energies) and the root mean square radii. The

ground-states of classical atoms have an inﬁnite number
of degenerated states. All of these conﬁgurations are ob-
tained performing rotation of the positions and the mo-
menta, or by seeking the ground-states from an ensemble
of initial conﬁgurations in the coordinate and momen-
tum space.
In our approach, we prepare the ensemble
of initial conﬁgurations. The binding energies and the
root mean square radii of the systems are calculated as
averaged values over the ensembles.

As it is often mentioned, the goal of the simulation
of the atomic systems with molecular dynamics is not
a fundamental theory but a practical tool. However it
turns out that our approach is suﬃcient to obtain sta-
ble atomic ground-states providing its atomic energies
fairly accurately. Using the obtained ensembles of initial
states which occupies diﬀerent points in the phase space,
molecular dynamics simulation with constraints for the
atomic collision has been performed and applied to fusion
S-factor calculations for astrophysical interests [9].

Consider an N -electrons atomic system. The exact
one body classical distribution function f (r, p, t) of the
system satisﬁes the transport equation[10]:

is the potential of the particle i, i.e., ion (i = 0) or an
electron (i = 1 ∼ N ), which is located at the position,
momentum and time (r,p,t). Here, qi and qj are the
charges of the particles i and j respectively. Substituting
the distribution function:

f (r, p, t) =

δ (r − ri(t)) δ (p − pi(t))

for eq. (1), we get the Hamilton equations

at every time-step. Using the obtained Ei, the binding
energy of the atom is determined by

(5)

i.e., the classical equation of motion.
In order to ob-
tain the atomic ground-state conﬁguration, We integrate
the eqs. (4) and (5) imposing the constraints. The con-
straints are performed numerically by controlling

∆rij · ∆pij ∼ ξ · ~,

(6)

where ∆rij = |ri − rj| and ∆pij = |pi − pj|. For the
Heisenberg principle ξ = 1 and i refers to electrons,
j refers to the nucleus. The value of ξ is determined
to reproduce the correct energy of hydrogenic atoms.
Instead for the Pauli exclusion principle following the
reference [1] we choose ξ = 2.767δSi,Sj , which repro-
duces the Fermi-energy of close-packed nearest-neighbor
electron gas model. Here i and j refer only to electrons
and Si, Sj(= ±1/2) are their spin projection.
More speciﬁcally,

1. We calculate ∆rij · ∆pij for pairs of particles, at

every time step of the calculation.

2.

If ∆rij · ∆pij

is smaller(larger) than ξ~, we
change rj and pj slightly, so that ∆rij · ∆pij becomes
larger(smaller) at the subsequent time step, thus we
change the phase space occupancy of the system.

We repeat this procedure for many time steps. The
constraints work as the “dissipative term” in the case of
the pseudo potential approach and lead automatically to
the minimum energy, i.e., the ground-state of the system.
The diﬀerence being that in the case of the model with
the pseudo potential, a dissipative term decreases the
total energy. In our case the total energy decreases or
increases depending on the phase space occupancy.

The electron conﬁgurations at the beginning of time
integral are randomly distributed in a sphere of radius
1.0 ˚A in the coordinate space and in a sphere of Fermi
momentum radius in the momentum space(or ~/1.0[˚A]
for H, He atoms).

In this way, at the beginning of the time integration we
have an ensemble of electron conﬁgurations which occu-
pies diﬀerent points in the phase space microscopically.
The integration of the eqs. (4) and (5) is performed us-
ing Hermite integration scheme which is eﬃcient and en-
ables integration with high precision. The scheme adopts
variable and individual time-steps for each electron [11].
Considering the target ﬁx frame, the single-particle en-
ergy of the ith electron is calculated as

The binding energy and the root mean square radius of
the atoms are calculated as an averaged value over the
ensemble of events.

We have applied the model to hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium, ﬂuorine atoms. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2
show that the systems converge to their ground-state in
the illustrative cases of lithium and beryllium atoms, re-
spectively. The top panels show the time development
of the ∆r · ∆p/ξ~, the middle panels show the binding
energy of the electrons and the bottom ones show their
root mean square radius. Due to the constraints these
three values oscillate as a function of time and converge
after some time. We determine the binding energy and
the radius by taking the average over not only events but
also over time.

We summarize our results of the ground-state energies
and the mean square radii for small atomic systems in
Table I and II, respectively. For the purpose of utilizing
the atomic conﬁguration to the collision calculations, the
comparison between our results and the ones from quan-
tum mechanical Hartree-Fock(HF) models is suggestive.
In Table I together with the ground-state energies from
our method, results from FMD method [12], from HF
method [13] and experimental values [14] are shown. The
comparison shows that our method gives ground-state
binding energies in good agreement with the quantum-
mechanical HF method.
In Table II we compare our
results of mean square radii(rms) for each atoms with
rms from FMD and from HF method. The results from
FMD which are obtained using diﬀerent parameter sets
are shown in two columns(FMD 0 [2] and FMD 1 [12]).
The column FMD 1 is with the optimized parameter sets.
Note that our method gives systematically smaller val-
ues as the root mean square radii than those from HF
method. However the variations between those results
from FMD 0 and FMD 1 suggest large ﬂuctuations in
rms radii for each atom. Therefore there are possibilities
to improve the rms with our approach as well, adjusting
the ξ values separately.

We have presented results of Constrained molecular
dynamics approach to describe the atomic ground-states
conﬁgurations. We calculated the binding energies of the
electrons in the atoms and its root mean square radii
and compared them with the results of the quantum me-
chanical Hartree-Fock calculations. The total electronic

energies for the ground-state atoms are given rather accu-
rately, though the root mean square radii are systemati-
cally smaller than that of HF simulations. However those
values of rms radii could be improved. At last we stress
that the intent of the CoMD simulation of the atomic

systems is to applying it to the collision calculations and
determining the Equation of State of matter at very low
temperatures where quantum eﬀects play a decisive role.

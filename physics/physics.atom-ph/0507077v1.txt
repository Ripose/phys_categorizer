Abstract

Collisions of polar 1Σ state molecules at ultralow energies are considered, within a model that

accounts for long-range dipole-dipole interactions, plus rotation of the molecules. We predict a

substantial suppression of dipole-driven inelastic collisions at high values of the applied electric

ﬁeld, namely, ﬁeld values of several times Be/µ. Here Be is the rotational constant, and µ is

the electric dipole moment of molecules. The sudden large drop in the inelastic cross section is

attributed to the onset of degeneracy between molecular rotational levels, which dramatically alters

the scattering Hamiltonian. As a result of the large ratio of elastic to inelastic collision rates, we

predict that evaporative cooling may be feasible for 1Σ state molecules in weak-ﬁeld-seeking states,

provided a large bias electric ﬁeld is present.

INTRODUCTION

The paramount goal of physics of ultracold temperatures is to control and manipulate the

quantum world. Polar molecules bring new challenges and hopes to this ﬁeld(see the review

in [1]). Since 1998 [2], several experimental groups have been restraining polar molecules in

order to get colder and denser samples. The diﬃculties on this road speak for themselves:

a whole variety of novel experimental techniques were developed for this purpose [1]. But

in spite of very intensive experimental research, the production of ultracold molecules still

poses a signiﬁcant challenge. Cold and dense samples would allow one to control two-

body [3, 4] and many-body systems of polar particles [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],

although so far none of these goals has been experimentally realized. The main obstacle

to these achievements is loss of trapped molecules via inelastic collisions, or else Majorana

transitions [16]. In this paper we study just one aspect of physics of cold polar molecules,

namely, the possibility to have molecules in a weak-ﬁeld-seeking state with suﬃciently low

inelastic collision rates to allow evaporative cooling.

We have previously considered the electrostatic trapping of polar Π-state molecules of

both bosonic (OH) and fermionic (OD) symmetry from the point of view of stability with

respect to collisions [17, 18]. As electrostatic trapping requires molecules to be in a weak-

electric-ﬁeld-seeking state, collisions involving the strong and anisotropic dipole-dipole inter-

action between molecules may drive the molecules into unfavorable lower-energy strong-ﬁeld

seeking states, leading to unacceptably high trap loss and heating. For bosonic Π- state OH

molecules we have found that the elastic rate can be much larger than the inelastic rate only

for quite large ﬁeld values. As the ﬁrst excited rotational level of OH lies 84K above the

ground state, inelastic rates are deﬁned mostly by Λ- doubling and a hyperﬁne splitting. In

general one cannot yet exclude the possibility of ﬁnding molecules whose hyperﬁne structure

permits evaporative cooling, but such a candidate has not yet been identiﬁed.

Polar fermions have a potentially important advantage for electrostatic trapping, namely,

low inelastic rates at cold temperatures. The state-changing collisions of dipolar fermionic

molecules were discussed in [18, 20]. Based on the well-known Wigner threshold laws for

dipole- dipole interactions it was shown that elastic scattering cross sections are essentially

independent of collision energy E at low energies, in electric ﬁelds suﬃciently strong to

polarize the molecules [18]). At the same time, state-changing cross sections scale as E1/2 for

2

fermions and as E−1/2 for bosonic molecules. Therefore, at “suﬃciently low” temperatures,

elastic scattering is always larger for fermions, and evaporative cooling should be possible.

Using the ﬁrst Born approximation(BA), it was concluded [20] that this is the case for the

molecules OCS and CH3Cl, at reasonable experimental temperatures. However, the BA

may not be strictly applicable [18] for all ﬁelds and energies of interest. Indeed, the Fermi

suppression of inelastic collisions may not be of great use for evaporatively cooling the OD

radical [18].

We are therefore motivated in this paper to re-visit the question of ﬁeld-dependent scat-

tering of 1Σ fermionic molecules, from the perspective of close-coupling (CC) calculations.

A complete theoretical description of molecule-molecule scattering is complicated by the

complexity of the short-range interaction between molecules. This interaction is generally

unknown to suﬃcient accuracy for cold collisions. Therefore in order to avoid the inclusion

of unknown parameters of interaction, we seek and explore situations in which the inﬂuence

of short-range physics is minimal. It appears that for weak- ﬁeld seeking states the inﬂu-

ence of the short-range potential is suppressed, owing to avoided crossings in the long-range

interaction [17]. For collisions of identical fermionic molecules, the inﬂuence of short-range

physics may be even smaller, since only partial waves with l

1 are present, and there is a

≥

centrifugal repulsion in all scattering channels.

In this paper we seek a case where the elastic rate can be signiﬁcantly larger than the

inelastic rate, by at least two orders of magnitude, and so provide feasible evaporative cooling

[21]. The most important ﬁnding here is that a large ratio of elastic and inelastic rates can

be found higher temperatures where the Wigner threshold law is not valid. Theoretically, we

suggest that this phenomenon is quite general, although large electric ﬁelds may be required.

This eﬀect exists even at temperatures around 1mK which is already experimentally attained

[1]. It is in just such a gas that evaporative cooling would be a useful technique for achieving

even higher phase-space density.

A. Polar 1Σ- type molecules

The majority of diatomic molecules have 1Σ electronic ground states [22]. The energy

levels of these species can be described by the rotation J, total spin F (i.e., including

nuclear spin), and vibration υ quantum numbers. In this paper for simplicity we will neglect

hyperﬁne splitting as the hyperﬁne interaction for 1Σ molecules is smaller than for Π or 3Σ

molecules and we consider them only in the υ = 0 vibrational ground state. So we will treat

polar molecules as rigid rotors with a permanent dipole moment. The Stark splitting will be

characterized by (J, MJ ), where MJ is the projection of J on the direction of the external

electric ﬁeld. Thus the Hamiltonian for a polar 1Σ molecule in a ﬁeld is

1Σ = Hrot + Hf ield

In this expression Be is the rotational constant, µ is the molecular dipole moment,

The diﬀerent values of the molecular rotation J are strongly mixed in laboratory strength

ﬁelds. Accordingly, in practice we transform the molecular state to a ﬁeld-dressed basis for

performing scattering calculations:

where α(J) stands for eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (1) determined numerically at each

value of the ﬁeld. The J quantum number is not a good quantum number in a ﬁeld, but we
will continue to refer to molecular states with ˜J as a reminder of the zero-ﬁeld value of J.

Figure 1 shows the Stark energies computed using all the ingredients described above. In

zero ﬁeld the energy levels are determined by the rotational constant Be. We demonstrate the

Stark splitting for linear OCS molecule which is quite typical for this type of molecule. For

the other molecules we consider, the ﬁgure would look exactly the same, but with rescaled

axes. We estimated that the hyperﬁne splitting is of order of µK, which means that this

4

eﬀect may be important for ultracold energies. But here we will ignore the hyperﬁne eﬀects

as the region of energies we are considering is quite above µK. The Stark shift is quadratic

for ﬁelds below the “critical ﬁeld” deﬁned by

we are interested in J = 1 states, the critical ﬁeld is given by

We express the Hamiltonian in a basis of projection of total angular momentum,

In practice, before each scattering calculation the Hamiltonian matrix has to be transformed

from this basis into the ﬁeld-dressed basis deﬁned by (3). We solve the coupled- channel

equations using a logarithmic derivative propagator method [24] to calculate total state-to-

state cross sections. Since the projection of total angular momentum on the ﬁeld axis,

,

is a conserved quantity, calculations can be performed for each value of

M
separately. We

M

ﬁnd, generally, that the dominant contribution to cross sections arises from the minimum

allowed value of

and that the general behavior of cross sections for other

is quite

M

similar, and so restrict calculations accordingly.

M

The scattering calculations quickly become computationally expensive as more rotational

states and partial waves are included. Because we need to calculate cross sections at many

electric ﬁeld values, we choose a “compromise” basis set that includes rotational levels up

to Jmax = 3 and partial waves up to Lmax = 3. This basis set then consists of 182 scattering

channels. This level of approximation tends to get the general magnitude of elastic scattering

cross sections fairly accurately, and to overestimate inelastic scattering cross sections. We

therefore expect to draw conservative conclusions on the high ratio of elastic to inelastic

scattering.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have chosen a variety of diﬀerent linear molecules for this study, to span a range of

rotational constants and dipole moments, and also to connect with the results of Ref. [20].

Properties of the molecules are summarized in Table I [25, 26]. Of particular interest is

the alkali dimer RbCs, which is a leading candidate in the experimental quest to observe

cold collisions [27]. For these molecules, we are interested in the lowest energy weak-ﬁeld-

seeking state of the ground vibrational state,

JMJ >=

10 > (see Fig 1). In contrast to

|

|

6

the Π molecules we have previously studied [28, 29], here it is necessary to include several

rotational levels of the molecule.

The general behavior of the thermally-averaged cross sections versus temperature is shown

in Fig. 2. This example is for ClCN molecules in an electric ﬁeld of

= 20 kV/cm, well

E

above the critical ﬁeld for this molecule, meaning that the molecule is strongly polarized.

The heavy solid and dashed lines represent (respectively) the elastic and state-changing

cross sections for fermionic isotopomers of this molecule. It can be seen that the standard

threshold behavior of colliding dipoles occurs at energies below several tens of microKelvin.

Namely, the elastic cross section becomes a constant, and the inelastic cross section goes to

zero as T 1/2 [18, 20]. By contrast, the light solid and dashed curves show the same quantities,

but for a bosonic isotopomer. Here the threshold laws work against the experimentalist, with
the inelastic rate diverging as T −1/2 [17, 23]. At higher temperatures, above the threshold

regime, the elastic and inelastic cross sections are comparable for both bosons and fermions,

consistent with what was found for OH and OD radicals in Ref.[18].

Remarkably, this situation can change quite dramatically if the electric ﬁeld takes certain

values. We illustrate this in Fig. 3, by plotting elastic and inelastic cross sections at T = 1

µK, versus electric ﬁeld.

In each case, the inelastic cross sections (dashed lines) fall by

2-4 orders of magnitude at a speciﬁc value of the electric ﬁeld. Here we show only results

for fermionic species. For bosonic species the corresponding drop is smaller because of the

threshold behavior at this energy. The ﬁeld values at which this suppression occurs, denoted
Esupp, are tabulated in Table I. In all cases the suppression occurs at around 3 times the
E0. To explore this phenomenon further, we focus on a particular example in
critical ﬁeld

the following, namely, a fermionic isotopomer of ClCN.

The unexpected suppression of inelastic collision rates has its origin in the interplay be-

tween the strong dipole-dipole interaction and the rotational energy levels of the molecules.

The ﬁrst clue to the mechanism of suppression comes from considering the scattering thresh-

olds, i.e., the total energy of both molecules when they are far apart.

(Fig. 4). Here

This is a strange situation, in which the state-changing collision cross sections diminish

sharply just as new states become energetically available. The second piece to this puzzle is

found by examining the approximate adiabatic potential energy curves for two situations, as

shown in Fig. 5. To simplify these curves, we have included only the partial wave L = 1 in

their construction, although L = 3 is also used in the multichannel scattering calculations.

In (a) are shown the curves for

= 12.3 kV/cm, just below the threshold crossing. Here the

incident channel

10, 10

is below the nearby thresholds, and correlates adiabatically to the

solid curve. This curve draws molecules into the small-R region where they interact strongly

E

|

i

and can readily change their internal state.

By contrast, Fig. 5(b) shows the adiabatic curves at a ﬁeld

= 13.7 kV/cm, just above

E

the threshold crossing. Now the incident channel correlates adiabatically to a repulsive curve,

so that the molecules do not approach one another nearly as closely as in the previous case.

This shielding, in turn, reduces the likelihood of inelastic collisions. The dominance of the

repulsive curve is a peculiarity of the strong, anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction, and is

similar to the physics that generates “ﬁeld-linked” molecular dimer states, which also keep

the molecules far from each other [28]. While this simple picture of the suppression is

probably a good ﬁrst approximation, there is clearly more going on. This can be seen in the
E0, even though this is the ﬁeld

Esupp, which are not always equal to 3

tabulated values of

value where the thresholds cross for any 1Σ molecule.

We also remark that we have noted a similar, but somewhat less dramatic, suppression of

inelastic cross sections in bosonic analogues of the molecules considered (Fig. 6). Presumably

fermions have an advantage since they have nonzero partial wave angular momentum in all

channels, which aids in the shielding eﬀect discussed above.

The strong suppression in the low-energy limit naturally has consequences at higher

collision energies. Figure 7 shows the elastic (solid) and inelastic (dashed) cross sections

versus temperature, at a ﬁeld

= 14 kV/cm, where the inelastic rates have just become

E

suppressed. Strikingly, the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections is close to two orders of

magnitude even at temperatures as high as several mK, which is easily attainable in Stark

deceleration or buﬀer-gas cooling experiments. For this reason, it is conceivable that cold,

dense samples might be amenable to evaporative cooling that will reduce them to ultracold

8

temperatures.

Figure 7 also illustrates the eﬀect of increasing the number of channels in the scattering

calculations. For both elastic (solid lines) and inelastic (dashed lines) cross sections, four

curves are shown, corresponding to various maximal numbers of rotational states (Jmax)

and partial waves (Lmax). In all cases, changing the size of the basis set has little inﬂuence

on the overall elastic scattering cross section, although the features understandably shift in

ﬁeld. By contrast, The inelastic cross sections are quite sensitive to Jmax, dropping more

than an order of magnitude as Jmax increases from 3 to 4. In addition, the number of partial

waves plays a role in the actual cross sections. In any event, the conclusions still hold, and

the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections should be quite high.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we considered the collisional dynamics of polar 1Σ molecules in a dc-electric

ﬁeld taking ClCN, HCN, OCS and RbCs as prototypes. The lowest weak-ﬁeld-seeking

state was studied from the point of view of evaporative cooling. As a rule the strong and

anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction should provide quite large inelastic rates. We have

found, however, that polar 1Σ state molecules possess a substantial suppression of inelastic

collisions at high values of the applied electric ﬁeld. The sudden drop in inelastic cross section

coincides with the degeneracy of certain molecular rotational levels. Adiabatic pictures

reveal that the interaction changes from mostly attractive to mostly repulsive upon crossing

the ﬁeld where this coincidence occurs. The strong suppression of inelastic scattering from

the

JMJ i

|

=

10

|

i

state of a 1Σ molecule seems generally to occur at a ﬁeld nearly equal to

3Be/µ, and may enable evaporative cooling in an electrostatic trap.

As a ﬁnal remark, we note that in many experiments alkali dimer molecules are formed

in high-lying vibrationally excited states, as a result of photoassociation or magneto-

association. In these quite diﬀerent states, the ﬁeld scale can be signiﬁcantly larger. To make

an estimate, consider the RbK molecule, which is being pursued by the UConn group [30].

In a hypothetical weakly-bound state whose outer turning point is 40 a.u., this molecule’s
rotational constant is approximately Be = 1.4 cm−1. The dipole moment of this molecule
10−5 ea0 at this intermolecular separation [31],

has been estimated to be approximately 1.4

yielding an critical ﬁeld of

2 MV/cm. Thus it would seem unlikely that the eﬀects de-

E0 ≈

×

scribed here are observable for such weakly-bound molecules. For even more weakly-bound

molecules, the critical ﬁeld quickly becomes larger, owing to the exponential falloﬀ of the

dipole moment.

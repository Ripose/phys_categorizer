Metastable calcium atoms, produced in a magneto–optic trap (MOT) operating within the singlet
system, are continuously loaded into a magnetic trap formed by the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld of the
MOT. At MOT temperatures of 3 mK and 240 ms loading time we observe 1.1 × 108 magnetically
trapped 3P2 atoms at densities of 2.4×108cm−3 and temperatures of 0.61 mK. In a modiﬁed scheme
we ﬁrst load a MOT for metastable atoms at a temperature of 0.18 mK and subsequently release
these atoms into the magnetic trap. In this case 240 ms of loading yields 2.4 × 108 trapped 3P2
atoms at a peak density of 8.7 × 1010cm−3 and a temperature of 0.13 mK. The temperature decrease
observed in the magnetic trap for both loading schemes can be explained only in part by trap size
eﬀects.

Earth alkaline atoms provide a unique combination of
interesting spectroscopic features connected to their two
valence electrons which give rise to singlet and triplet
excitations. The singlet systems possess strong princi-
ple ﬂuorescence lines well suited for laser cooling with
remarkable eﬃciency. Yet, temperatures are limited to
the mK domain, due to the absence of ground state
Zeeman structure, a prerequisite for sub–Doppler tech-
niques. The triplet systems, however, have readily acces-
sible narrow band optical transitions that render possible
reﬁned laser cooling schemes with the promise of tem-

peratures even beyond the microkelvin range.
such schemes have recently been experimentally realized
for strontium and calcium [1, 2, 3, 4]. Owing to their
spectroscopic peculiarities such ultracold earth alkaline
samples open up new prospects for ultraprecise atomic
clocks [5, 6, 7] and cold collision studies which allow di-
rect comparisons with ab initio theoretical calculations
[8, 9, 10]. The formation of Bose–Einstein condensates
(BEC, [11]) for this exciting group of atoms appears par-
ticularly desirable.

In this article we explore the application of magnetic
trapping (a key technique of BEC experiments) to the
case of 40Ca. While the singlet ground state of 40Ca
lacks magnetic sub–structure, the ground state of the
triplet system typically oﬀers a particularly large Zee-
man eﬀect. Speciﬁcally, the long–lived 3P2, mJ =2 state
appears appropriate for magnetic trapping. Recent cal-
culations predict a positive scattering length (and thus
stable BEC) for this state [10].

We prepare cold Calcium 3P2 atoms in the mK range
at very high rates from a magneto–optic trap operating
on the principle ﬂuorescence line of the singlet system at
423 nm (called SMOT in the following) [12]. The excited
state of the SMOT–transition has a small decay channel
leading to the 1D2 state (γ1 = 2180 s−1 [13]) and further
on to the 3P2 (γ2 = 96 s−1) and 3P1 (γ3 = 300 s−1)

triplet states (see Fig.1a for relevant Ca levels). While
the atoms decaying via 3P1 return to the ground state in
about 3 ms and can be recycled into the SMOT, those
decaying to 3P2 represent a permanent loss that limits
the SMOT life time to 21 ms. Transfer rates into the
3P2 state can exceed 1010 atoms/s at a temperature of
about 2–3 mK determined by the Doppler temperature of
the SMOT. In order to prepare even colder 3P2 atoms,
we superimpose a second magneto–optic trap (TMOT)
for 3P2 atoms using the narrow–band 3P2 →3D3 triplet
transition at 1978 nm [4].
If the TMOT is optimized
for high loading rates it typically collects several times
108 atoms within 240 ms at temperatures around 180 µK.
The magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld shared by the SMOT
and TMOT provides a natural test ground for mag-
netic trapping of 3P2 atoms. The trapping potential is
1
4 (x2 + y2) + z2 with U0 =
given by U (x, y, z) = U0q
2π¯h × g × mJ × b × (1.4M Hz/Gauss), where b is the
magnetic ﬁeld gradient, mJ is the magnetic quantum
number, and g denotes the g–factor. Due to the large
value g=3/2 for the 3P2 state, for atoms in the low ﬁeld
seeking mJ =2 Zeeman component a magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient b of only 2.5 Gauss/cm is suﬃcient to compensate
for gravity, and 10 Gauss/cm provide a signiﬁcant trap
potential of 2.5 mK/cm.

The experimental setup is an extension of that used
in ref.
[4]. Fig.1b provides a sketch of the relevant ele-
ments. Three beams with 8 mm in diameter and 20 mW
power, detuned from resonance by two times the nat-
ural line width, are retroreﬂected in order to form the
SMOT. Atoms are provided from a Zeeman–decelerated
atomic beam. By observation of the 423 nm ﬂuorescence
we measure 4 ∗ 107 atoms in the excited 1P1 state of
the SMOT. From the known transition rates (see e.g.
[13]) we can deduce a transfer rate into the 3P2
ref.
state of 1.9 × 1010 atoms/s. The magnetic quadrupole
ﬁeld with horizontal symmetry axis (z–axis) has a trap
depth of 20.6 mK and a magnetic ﬁeld gradient (along
the z– axis) of b=26 Gauss/cm in the origin. For mon-
itoring the operation of the SMOT we record the ﬂuo-
rescence at 657 nm due to atoms decaying via 1D2 and
3P1 back to the ground state. In order to observe the
3P2 atoms we optically pump them to the 3P1 state by
applying a 0.5 ms pulse of 430 nm light resonant with
the 3P2(4s4p) →3P2(4p4p) transition. The 1/e2–radius
of this optical pumping beam is 3 mm. In order to work
with a reduced optical pumping volume, a variable ap-
perture placed inside this beam is imaged onto the atomic
sample. The 3P1 atoms decay to the 1S0 singlet ground
state in 0.4 ms and are subject to ballistic expansion.
Temperature measurements are performed with a time of
ﬂight method (TOF). A 10 mm wide and 0.5 mm thick
sheet of light resonant with the 1S0 →1P1 transition is
placed 9 mm below the center of the optical pumping
beam (see Fig.1b). The ﬂuorescence in this light sheet is
recorded by a photo multiplier from below. Because we
operate the TMOT with the same magnetic quadrupole
ﬁeld, the narrow bandwidth (57 kHz) of the 3P2 →3D3
transition is power–broadened to a peak value of 16 MHz,
in order to obtain suﬃcient spatial capture volume. With
5 mW for each of the three retroreﬂected beams of 10
mm diameter the resonant peak saturation parameter is
7.6 × 104.

In Fig.2 the operation of the magnetic trap is illus-
trated. Before t=0, for about 240 ms atoms are Zee-
man cooled, loaded into the SMOT, and transferred to
the magnetically trapped 3P2 state. At t=0 the 423 nm
beams are disabled, i.e. no further loading of the mag-
netic trap occurs which is seen from the drop of 657 nm
ﬂuorescence in trace (a). After a variable time delay the
optical pumping pulse is applied which gives rise to a
spike of 657 nm ﬂuorescence, and a TOF spectrum is
recorded (trace (b)). Alternatively, during the loading
period before t=0 we may apply the TMOT. In this case
the magnetic trap is not continuously loaded but at t=0
the 3P2 atoms trapped and cooled in the TMOT are sud-
denly released into the magnetic trap. Detection is per-
formed as in the case of SMOT loading. While TMOT
loading allows for lower initial temperatures, an attrac-
tive feature of SMOT loading is its continuous character,
i.e. the possibility to add particles to the trap without
disturbing those already trapped, as recently discussed
in ref. [14] and demonstrated for chromium atoms in

By varying the trapping time in Fig.2 and observing
the size of the 657 nm ﬂuorescence peak in trace (a) we
can measure the life time of the magnetic trap. The case
of TMOT loading is shown in Fig.3a (open rectangles).
For comparison, the ﬁlled rectangles show the decay of
the TMOT itself. A surprisingly high transfer rate of
about 75 % is observed. The ﬁtted exponentials (solid
lines in Fig.3a) correspond to a model which neglects
two–body collision losses. The decay time constants of
239 ± 4 ms in the upper trace and 228 ± 8 ms ms in the
lower trace agree within the errors and are in accordance
with the 10−8 mbar vacuum conditions. For SMOT load-
ing the same decay time is found. Although a model ac-
counting for inelastic two–body collisions yields slightly
better ﬁts for the lower trace in Fig.3a, slow ﬂuctuations
of the initial sample sizes in our present data do not allow
us to extract reliable values for the collision rate.

In Fig.3b TOF spectra are shown for three diﬀerent
cases. The upper trace (1) shows a TOF spectrum for
atoms trapped in the TMOT for 370 ms with a loading
period of 240 ms. In trace (2) the TMOT was loaded for
240 ms but subsequently the atoms were released into
the magnetic trap and held there for 130 ms. In trace
(3) the SMOT continuously loaded the magnetic trap for
240 ms followed by 130 ms without further loading. Note,
that in either case (2) and (3) the temperature found in
the magnetic trap is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the
loaded atomic sample. In trace (3) the initial sample in
the SMOT has a temperature of about 3 mK, while that
of the magnetically trapped sample is only 611 µK. In
(2) the initial sample temperature is 182 µK as seen in
trace (1), while the temperature in the magnetic trap is
only 134 µK. The ﬁts in Fig.3b (solid black lines) used
to evaluate temperatures are derived from a TOF model

with three ﬁt parameters: the initial vertical diameters
and atom numbers of the fraction of atoms participat-
ing in the ballistic ﬂight, and the temperatures. The
initial sizes found in these ﬁts are consistent with those
observed. The diameter of the TMOT is estimated to
be 2 mm by scanning the 430 nm optical pumping beam
with 0.5 mm diameter through the atomic sample and ob-
serving the 657 nm ﬂuorescence peak of Fig.2a. This cor-
responds to the best ﬁt in trace (1) obtained for 2.4 mm.
The initial diameter for the TOF measurement of trace
(2) is estimated similarly to be about 4 mm correspond-
ing to the value of 4.1 mm in the best ﬁt. The best
ﬁt value of the initial diameter for trace (3) of 7.9 mm
does not reﬂect the size of the trapped population but is
determined by the 3 mm maximal radius of the optical
pumping beam. In traces (2) and (3) we also recognize
a hot fraction of atoms occurring at early times in the
TOF-spectra which are not accounted for in our model.
Particularly, in the case of TMOT loading (trace (2)) a
well distinguished hot fraction (at several mK) is visi-
ble. For TMOT loading, TOF spectra recorded for trap-
ping times shorter than 100 ms show additional structure
which reﬂects non–equilibrium trap dynamics as is illus-
trated in Fig.4. The initial sharp peaks, resulting from
the 430 nm depumping photons, indicate the release of
the atoms from the magnetic trap. One recognizes an
oscillation of population between hotter and colder frac-
tions of atoms occuring at earlier or later times in the

TOF spectra.

In order to explain the temperature decrease in the
magnetic trap we ﬁrst consider the case of SMOT load-
ing in trace (3). The 3P2 trap potential is continuously
loaded by the cold ﬂux of atoms emerging from the trap-
ping volume of the SMOT with σ=1 mm 1/e2–radius
via intermediate population of the 1D2 state where the
atoms spend on average 10 ms. During this process the
atoms remain subjected to magnetic trapping since the
1D2 state itself provides a trap potential with 2/3 of the
size of that of the 3P2 state. If the initial atomic sample
is smaller than the equilibrium distribution inside the
magnetic trap, an expansion occurs which reduces the
mean kinetic energy of the initial sample kBTi by the
average potential energy of the ﬁnal equilibrium distri-
bution ρ minus the average potential energy of the initial
distribution. Thus, for the quadrupole potential U the
ﬁnal kinetic energy is calculated to be kBTf = kBTi/3 +
0.172 ×σ × U0. The second term corresponds to 90 µK
for SMOT loading and may be neglected as compared
to typical initial SMOT temperatures of 3 mK. Thus,
temperatures above 1 mK are expected, exceeding the
observed 0.6 mK. In case of TMOT loading in trace (2) a
similar deviation is found. Here 0.172 ×σ × U0 amounts
to 108 µK and thus the expected temperature is 169 µK
as compared to 134 µK observed.

Let us next estimate the capture eﬃciencies beginning
with SMOT loading. We ﬁrst calculate the average Zee-
man detuning δB experienced by the diﬀerent Zeeman
components of the 1P1 fraction of the SMOT sample in
the quadrupole ﬁeld U(x,y,z). With b=26 Gauss/cm we
get δB(mJ )/Γ = 0.08 × mJ . Using these Zeeman detun-
ings we calculate the average relative excitation proba-
bilities of the 1P1 Zeeman components ﬁnding 37 % for
the high ﬁeld seeking mJ =-1 state, 34 % for the non–
magnetic state, and 29 % for the low ﬁeld seeking mJ =1
state. With the help of the Clebsch–Gordan coeﬃcients
we derive the relative populations of the Zeeman sub-
levels in the 1D2 and 3P2 states respectively. We ﬁnd
18 % population in the mJ =2 – and 19 % population in
the mJ =1 low ﬁeld seeking component of the 3P2 level

which are the two trapped states. In case of TMOT load-
ing all atoms leaving the 1P1 state should be captured in
the TMOT and about 20 % of those atoms should be
transfered to each of the two magnetically trapped Zee-
man sublevels. For SMOT loading only a fraction of the
magnetically trapped atoms can contribute to the 657 nm
ﬂuorescence peak following the optical pumping pulse.
In order to calculate the transfer eﬃciency by optical
pumping we have numerically integrated the product of
the thermal equilibrium distribution in the 3P2 potential
ρ(x, y, z) = (32π)−1(U0/kBT )3 exp(−U (x, y, z)/kBT )
and the local optical pumping probability during the
0.5 ms pumping pulse. To derive the local pumping prob-
ability we have solved a rate equation including all levels
involved and account for the local intensity, polarization
and the Zeeman detunings from resonance due to the
magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld. Temperatures are inserted as
obtained from Fig.3b. For SMOT loading we ﬁnd that
a fraction of 39 % of the mJ =2 atoms and 14 % of the
mJ =1 atoms is transfered. For TMOT loading no loss
should occur in the optical pumping transfer.

For SMOT loading we typically observe a 657 nm ﬂu-
orescence peak with 2.9 × 107 atoms. Accounting for the
expected transfer eﬃciency by optical pumping discussed
in the previous paragraph we obtain 5.4 × 107 trapped
mJ =2 atoms and 5.7 × 107 trapped mJ =1 atoms. As-
suming thermal equilibrium at 611 µK, the peak density
is 3.4 × 108cm−3 for mJ =2 atoms and 1 × 108cm−3 for
mJ =2 atoms. Accounting for the loading time of 240 ms
a capture rate of the mJ =2 component of 3.6 × 108s−1
is observed. This is to be compared with 18 % of the
overall transfer rate of 1.9 × 1010s−1, i.e. 3.4 × 109s−1.
For TMOT loading we ﬁnd 2.4 × 108 ﬂuorescing atoms,
and accordingly 1.2 × 108 atoms in each of the two
magnetically trapped Zeeman sublevels. Assuming ther-

4

mal equilibrium at 135 µK, we ﬁnd a peak density of
6.7 × 1010cm−3 for mJ =2 atoms and 2 × 1010cm−3
for mJ =1 atoms. The observed mJ =2 capture rate is
7.9 × 108s−1 and has to be compared with 20 % of the
overall transfer rate of 1.9 × 1010s−1, i.e. 3.8 × 109s−1.
Presently, we cannot resolve the discrepancies be-
tween the expected and the observed capture rates which
amount to a factor 9.4 for SMOT loading and a factor
4.8 for TMOT loading. There is no indication of signif-
icant inelastic collisional loss in the life time measure-
ments of Fig.3a, which is consistent with the moderate
loss coeﬃcients in the 10−13cm3s−1 range predicted in
ref.
[10]. Also speculations, that evaporation of a frac-
tion of atoms into highly excited motional states of the
magnetic trap could occur, which are not accessed by
the pumping pulse, are not consistent with the moder-
ate densities observed for SMOT loading, allthough this
would help to explain the comparably low temperatures
observed. More likely, the loss of atoms occurs during
their stay in the 1D2 level. According to known transi-
tion rates the population of this state is 2 × 108, if colli-
sional loss is neglected. Assuming thermal equilibrium at
611 µK, the corresponding peak density is 3.7×108cm−3.
This density is comparable to that obtained in the 3P2
level for SMOT loading, however, the sizes of the corre-
sponding inelastic collision cross sections are not known
and leave room for speculations.

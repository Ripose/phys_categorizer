Abstract

We derive a generalized Low equation for the T-matrix appropriate for com-

plex atom-molecule interaction. The properties of this new equation at very

low enegies are studied and the complex scattering length and eﬀective range

are derived.

The recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of ultracold atoms with

the accompanying upsurge of theoretical activities have rekindled interest in low energy

collisions of atoms and molecules. The subsequent proposals for the creation of ultracold

molecular [1-5] and hybrid atomic-molecular BEC [6,7] intensiﬁed the above mentioned

interest Of particular importance in the above recent developments is the idea of decay of

the condensates. In a series of papers, Dalgarno and collaborators [8-12] have looked into

the idea of using a complex scattering length to represent the low-energy atom-molecule

scattering. Implicit in this is the multichannel nature of the collision process: an atom hits

a vibrationally excited molecule at extremely low energies. The open inelastic channels are

those where the molecule is excited into lower vibrational states. In this sense one has a

depletion of the elastic channel. In Ref. [8], the quenching of H2 molecules in collisions with

H was considered.

It was found that, the inelastic cross-sections and the corresponding

depletion rate coeﬃcients were very large for high vibrational levels of H2.

In the above studies, the following form of low-energy S-wave scattering amplitude is

used

f (k) =

1

g (k2) − i k

,

(1)

where k is the wave number related to the center of mass energy of the colliding partners,

E, by ℏk2

2µ = E, with µ being the reduced mass of the system. The function g (k2) is even in

k and is given by the eﬀective range formula.

g(cid:0)k2(cid:1) = −

(2)

where a is the scattering length and r◦ the eﬀective range, both directly related to the inter-

action. When applied to atom-molecule scattering at very low energies, with the molecules

suﬀering inelastic transitions to lower vibrational states, the scattering length a is taken to

be complex, a = α − iβ, with β related to the total inelastic cross-section.

The question we raise here is the validity of Eq. (1) with a and eventually r◦ taken

as complex in the case of the elastic scattering with strong coupling to inelastic channels.

Of course, an equivalent one-channel description of the elastic scattering can be formulated

with the introduction of an appropriate complex optical potential as described by Feshbach

[13]. It is therefore legitimate to inquire about the validity of Eq. (1), originally obtained for

real potential, if a complex interaction is used [14]. The general structure of the low energy

scattering amplitude is also of potentially fundamental importance to very low energy matter

interferometry. This method for the obtention of f for molecule-molecule scattering has been

quite successful at room temperatures [15,16]. Extension to very low temperatures of this

method seems natural and would welcome studies of the type reported here.

For the above purpose, it is useful to summarize the elegant derivation of Eq. (1) given

by Weinberg [17].

If we denote the interaction by V and the free Green’s function by

G(+)

o

(E) = (E − Ho + iε)−1, then the T-matrix given by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation

T (+) = V + V G(+)

o T (+), can be written as T (+) = V + V G(+)V , with the full Green’s function

G(+) = (E + iε − Ho − V )−1. Using the spectral expansion of G(+), with the complete set

of bound and scattering states (cid:8)|Bi ,(cid:12)(cid:12)Ψ(+)(cid:11)(cid:9), we obtain the Low-equation

D~k′(cid:12)(cid:12)T (+) (E)(cid:12)(cid:12)

At very low energies relevant for BEC, we seek a solution T~k′k (E) ≡ T (E) and writing

V~k′k ≡ t(+) we have

t(+) = ¯V +XB

~k′k′′ (Ek′′)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

E − Ek′′ + iε

Calculating now t(+) (E)−1 − t(−) (E)−1, we ﬁnd

t(+) (E)−1 − t(−) (E)−1 =

t(−) (E) − t(+) (E)
t(−) (E) t(+) (E)

.

(5)

Since t(−) (E) = T (E − iε) = (cid:0)T (+) (E + iε)(cid:1)∗

, if V is real, we have, with the change of

2 which is just the discontinuity across the positive energy

t(+) (E)−1 −t(−) (E)−1 = −2ik 2π 2µ
cut in the complex energy plane. Besides the poles in t, (cid:0)zeros in (t)−1(cid:1), the only other terms
in (cid:0)t(+)(cid:1)−1

are entire functions of W ≡ E + iε. Accordingly, with the identiﬁcation f =

2 t, Eq. (1) follows.

We turn next to a complex interaction V 6= V †. The completeness relation now reads

It is clear that the Low equation, Eq. (3), is not valid anymore. However, as we show

below Eq. (1) is still valid, with the appropriate generalization of the real function g (k2)

|V | ~kE. From the

˜T = V + V G(−)V .

(9)

Accordingly the T-matrix equation, Eq (7), may be written as

D~k′ |T (E)| ~kE = D~k |V | ~kE +XB
+Z d~k′′D~k′ |T (E′′)| ~k′′ED~k′′(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜T (E)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

A similar equation holds for D~k′(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
~kEwith iε replaced by −iε. It is interesting at
this point to show the relation between the physical T-matrix element D~k′ |T (E)| ~kE and
˜T (E)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
D~k′(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

~k′′ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Eq. (11) explicitly exhibits the connection between ˜T and T through the absorptive part

of the eﬀective interaction.

Now we seek the low energy solution D~k′ |T | ~kE ≡ t+ (E) and D~k′(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

following the same steps as Weinberg’s [17], we ﬁnd immediately, with f± = − 1

(14)

where gc (k2) is the complex generalization of g (k2) of Eq. (1).

We turn now to the connection between gc (k2) and the low-energy observables. This is

most conveniently accomplished by employing the generalized optical theorem

4π

Im f+ = σel + σin ,

(15)

where σel is the total elastic scattering cross section 4π |f+|2 and σin, the total inelastic

cross-section.

Using (12), we ﬁnd

σin .

(16)

At k = 0, gc (0) = − 1

a , where a is the complex scattering length written as [8] α − iβ.

Thus the imaginary part of a, β, is found to be

β =

(k σin)k=0

4π

,

(17)

an expression also derived in Ref. [8]. Eq. (16) clearly implies that σin should go as k−1 as

k is lowered, in accordance with Wigner’s law.

We go a bit beyond Refs. [8-12] and derive a relation between β and the imaginary part

of the eﬀective potential. Since σin is given by (for S-wave scattering), Eq. (12)

σin =

4π

(19)

An equation for the complex eﬀective range, r◦, can also be easily derived Equation (18)

is the principle result of this work. It summarizes the following:

1) The coupled-channels calculation aimed to describe the molecular quenching can be

recast as an eﬀective one-channel calculation with a complex interaction whose imag-

inary part account for ﬂux loss.

2) The low-energy behaviour of the scattering amplitude with the complex interaction

alluded to above can be conveniently parametrized in terms of complex scattering

length and eﬀective range.

The message this work conveys is the potential usefulness of constructing the eﬀective

complex (optical) interaction for the scattering of ro-vibrational molecules from atoms at

low energies. The calculation of a and r◦ from knowledge of this potential can be done in a

direct and unambiguous way.

Abstract
Metastability and long-range interactions of Mg, Ca, and Sr in the lowest-energy metastable
3P2 state are investigated. The calculated lifetimes are 38 minutes for Mg∗, 118 minutes for
Ca∗, and 17 minutes for Sr∗, supporting feasibility of cooling and trapping experiments. The
quadrupole-quadrupole long-range interactions of two metastable atoms are evaluated for various
molecular symmetries. Hund’s case (c) 4g potential possesses a large 100-1000 K potential barrier.
Therefore magnetic trap losses can possibly be reduced using cold metastable atoms in a stretched
M = 2 state. Calculations were performed in the framework of ab initio relativistic conﬁguration
interaction method coupled with the random-phase approximation.

INTRODUCTION

This work is motivated by emerging experiments on cooling and trapping of alkaline-earth
atoms ( see, e.g., Ref. [1, 2, 3]). In particular, the long-lived lowest-energy 3P2 state can
serve as an eﬀective ground state in such experiments. Recently Katori et al. [4] cooled and
trapped metastable Sr and proposed a scheme for a continuous atom laser with a possible
application in atom lithography. The purpose of this work is to evaluate properties of
metastable nsnp 3P2 states for Mg (n = 3), Ca (n = 4), and Sr (n = 5). In particular, we
calculated decay rates of the nsnp 3P2 states. The resulting lifetimes are on the order of
103 − 104 s supporting the feasibility of the experiments.

Ultracold collision properties, including scattering lengths, are sensitive to long-range
atomic interactions. The dominant van der Waals interaction of two atoms in their respective
3P2 states is described in terms of the quadrupole moment of the atomic state. To assist in
determining molecular potentials, the atomic quadrupole moments of Mg∗, Ca∗, and Sr∗ are
also calculated here, and the relevant C5 coeﬃcients for various molecular symmetries are
tabulated. These coeﬃcients are substantially larger compared to those for metastable noble-
gases [5]. In particular, Hund’s case (c) 4g potential possesses a large 100-1000 K potential
barrier. Therefore magnetic-trap losses can possibly be reduced using cold metastable atoms
in a stretched M = 2 state [6].

II. METHOD

Ab initio relativistic valence conﬁguration-interaction (CI) method coupled with random-
phase approximation (RPA) was employed here. A detailed description of this method [7]
will be published elsewhere; only a brief discussion is presented here. In this method the
wave-function is expanded in terms of two-particle basis functions as

(1)

(2)

Ψ (πJM) =

ckl Φkl ( πJM) .

Xk≥l

Here J is the total angular momentum with projection M, and π is the parity of the state
Ψ. The weights ckl and energies are found by solving the eigen-value problem based on the
no-pair Hamiltonian [8]. The basis functions are deﬁned in the subspace of virtual orbitals

Φkl ( πJM) = ηkl

kl = 1 − 1

where sets {nκm} enumerate quantum numbers, η2
2δnknlδκkκl is a normalization
factor, a† are creation operators, and the quasi-vacuum state |0corei corresponds to a closed-
shell core. The one-particle orbitals are found in the-frozen core (V N −2) approximation,
i.e. the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) equations are solved self-consistently for core orbitals,
and the virtual orbitals are determined using the resulting DHF potential of the core. The
employed set of basis functions in Eq. (2) is essentially complete, and one could interpret
the solution of the eigen-value problem as treating the strong Coulomb repulsion of the two
valence electrons to all orders of perturbation theory. This valence-CI method being exact
for He-like systems [9], represents an approximation for the alkaline-earth systems. The
core-polarization eﬀects and the Breit interaction are neglected here.

Once the wave-functions are determined, the matrix elements of a one-particle opera-
i aj are computed by forming products hΨF |Z|ΨIi. The additional RPA

stitutes a substitution of the “bare” one-particle matrix elements zij by “dressed” matrix
elements zRPA
. Such an approach sums a certain class of many-body diagrams to all orders

of perturbation theory.

The conﬁguration-interaction eigenvalue problem was solved numerically using the B-
spline basis set technique [11]. The employed basis set included the partial waves s1/2–
h11/2. For each partial wave, 40 positive-energy basis functions approximated by B-splines
represented a complete set. An inclusion of the 30 lowest-energy basis functions for each
partial wave was found to be suﬃcient for the goals of this work.

III.

LIFETIME OF 3P2 STATES

Single-photon transitions from the metastable 3P2 state are presented in Fig. 1. It will
be demonstrated that for Mg and Ca this level predominantly decays through magnetic-
quadrupole (M2) transition to the ground 1S0 state. For Sr the main decay channel is a
magnetic-dipole (M1) transition to the J = 1 level of the same 3P ﬁne-structure multiplet.
Estimates show that the magnetic-octupole (M3) 3P2 →3 P1 transition and all second-order
two-photon decays contribute a negligibly small fraction to the total decay rate. Further,
cold-atom experiments are focused on isotopes without nuclear spin to avoid negotiating
molecular potentials complicated by hyperﬁne structure; we will not consider otherwise
important electric-dipole hyperﬁne-structure induced decays [12].

The data on magnetic-quadrupole transitions (M2) are scarce. For Mg the 3P2 −1 S0 M2
rates were estimated by Mizushima [13] and Garstang [12] more than three decades ago and
recently by J¨onsson and Fischer [14]. There are no published data on M2 transition rates
for Ca and Sr.

A general treatment of multipole electromagnetic transitions in the relativistic frame-
work can be found, for example, in Ref. [9]. The Einstein coeﬃcient AM 2 for a magnetic-
quadrupole transition I → F is given by[19]

where ω is the photon frequency and α is the ﬁne-structure constant. The relevant one-
particle reduced matrix element can be expressed as

Here C (2) is the normalized spherical harmonic [15], G(F ) are large (small) radial components
of a wavefunction, κ = (l−j)(2j+1), and photon wavevector is deﬁned as k = ω/c. The term
in curly brackets approaches unity in the long-wavelength approximation. Although the full
retarded form of the matrix element was used in the calculations, the long-wavelength limit
is well satisﬁed for transitions between the lowest-energy valence states of alkaline-earth
atoms. While the matrix element is largely independent of the transition frequency ω, the
rate AM 2 depends on it strongly ( ∼ ω5 ) and the experimental energy intervals were used
in the ﬁnal tabulation.

The calculated CI+RPA magnetic-quadrupole transition rates are presented in Table I.
It was found that the RPA-dressing of matrix elements aﬀects these rates only on the order
of 1%. The calculated M2 transition rate for Mg∗, 4.41 × 10−4 1/s, is in a fair agreement
with the multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock result, 3.983 ×10−4 1/s, by J¨onsson and Fischer [14].
Both rates are as twice as large compared to the earlier estimate [12], 1.6 × 10−4 1/s.

Magnetic-dipole 3P2 →3 P1 transitions occur between the levels of the same ﬁne-structure
multiplet. The associated decay rate can be reliably estimated in the nonrelativistic approx-
imation as

The M1 rates, presented in Table I, were computed using experimental energy intervals.
The determined rate for Mg is 3% larger than in calculations [14] where theoretical ﬁne-
structure splittings were employed. The discrepancy is accounted for by a diﬀerence between
theoretical and experimental energies.

AM 1 =

α5ω3 .

(5)

We also calculated electric-quadrupole (E2) decay rates to the 3P1,0 ﬁne-structure levels.
The results listed in Table I show that the contribution of these decay channels is small
compared to the M2 and M1 rates.

From the analysis of Table I one ﬁnds that for Mg and Ca the 3P2 state predominantly
decays through magnetic-quadrupole (M2) transition to the ground 1S0 state. For Sr the
main decay channel is a magnetic-dipole (M1) transition to the J = 1 level of the same 3P
ﬁne-structure multiplet. Overall, the calculated lifetimes for Mg∗,Ca∗, and Sr∗ are on the
order of 103 − 104 seconds, thus favoring the usage of these metastable alkaline-earth atoms
in cooling and trapping experiments.

IV. QUADRUPOLE-QUADRUPOLE LONG-RANGE INTERACTIONS

Ultracold collision properties, including scattering lengths, are sensitive to long-range
atomic interactions. Here we focus on the long-range interactions of two alkaline-earths
atoms in their respective 3P2 states. At large internuclear separations, R, atomic wavefunc-
tions are perturbed by the axially-symmetric molecular potential, which itself depends on
the electronic coordinates and the internuclear distance. This potential can be expanded in a
sum of interactions of various atomic multipoles [16]. The lowest-order correction to molec-
ular term energies correlating to two 3P2 atomic states arises from a quadrupole-quadrupole
contribution [17]

Using the valence CI-method coupled with the RPA dressing of matrix elements we cal-
culated the quadrupole moments (see Table II). It was found that the RPA sequence of
diagrams reduces the ﬁnal result only by 0.1% for Mg, 0.3% for Ca, and 0.5% for Sr. Due to
the diﬀuse nature of valence states, these quadrupole moments are signiﬁcantly larger than
those found for metastable noble-gas atoms [5], where the hole in the outer p3/2 subshell
determines the quadrupole moment.

As in the case of metastable 3P2 noble-gas atoms [5, 18], the long-range molecular po-
the
tentials of metastable alkaline-earth atoms depend on their spatial orientation, i.e.
interactions are anisotropic. Altogether, 15 distinct molecular states correlate to the two
atomic 3P2 states at large separations. The ﬁrst order correction to a molecular term may
be represented as

U (1)(R) =

C5
R5 .

(10)

The relevant constants C5 for various molecular symmetries are given in Table III, where
the states are characterized using Hund’s case (c). These coeﬃcients were obtained by
diagonalizing the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, Eq. (6), in the basis of products of
atomic states |3P2, MiI ⊗ |3P2, M ′iII for a given symmetry Ω satisfying M + M ′ = Ω.

Seven of the resulting quadrupole-quadrupole long-range potentials are attractive at large
distances and eight are repulsive. We present the most repulsive 0+
g and the most attractive
3g potentials in Fig. 2. It is worth discussing the repulsive 4g potential also shown in Fig. 2.
Provided the metastable atoms in a magnetic trap are prepared in a stretched M = 2 state,
the collisions would occur along this repulsive Ω = 4 potential. Although the medium-range
part of the potential is attractive, the resulting barrier will be on the order of 100-1000 K
high. Therefore ultracold collisions of the 3P2 alkaline-earth atoms in a stretched M = 2
state can be eﬀectively shielded from the losses occurring at small internuclear distances [6].
This barrier is more pronounced compared to metastable noble-gas atoms [5], where the
potential barriers were a few nK high. Clearly, calculations of the second-order C6 dispersion
coeﬃcients and intermediate- and short-range parts of the potentials are needed for a more
quantitative description.

V. CONCLUSION

To address the needs of emerging experiments on cooling and trapping of alkaline-earth
atoms, we performed ab initio relativistic calculations of lifetimes and quadrupole moments
of metastable Mg, Ca, and Sr. The determined lifetimes are 38 minutes for Mg∗, 118 minutes
for Ca∗, and 17 minutes for Sr∗, supporting the feasibility of experiments. In addition, we
investigated long-range quadrupole-quadrupole interactions for molecular potentials corre-
lating to two metastable atoms. Several resulting potentials possess pronounced barriers,
which could be exploited to minimize trap losses.

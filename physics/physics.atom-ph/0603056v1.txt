Abstract

Using He@C60 as an example, we demonstrate that static potential of the fullerene core es-

sentially alters the cross section of the two-electron ionization diﬀerential in one-electron energy

dσ++(ω)/dε. We found that at high photon energy prominent oscillations appear in it due to

reﬂection of the second, slow electron wave on the C60 shell, which ”dies out” at relatively high

ε values, of about 2

3 two-electron ionization potentials. The results were presented for ratios

÷

RC60 (ω, ε)

dσ++(ω, ε)/dσa++(ω, ε), where dσa++(ω, ε)/dε is the two-electron diﬀerential pho-

toionization cross section. We have calculated the ratio Ri,f ul = σ++

for reﬂection of both photoelectrons by the C60 shell. We have calculated also the value of two-

electron photoionization cross section σ++(ω) and found that this value is close to that of an

isolated He atom.

INTRODUCTION

account.

Elimination of two electrons by a single photon from an atom or multi-atomic formation,

such as cluster or fullerene, can take place only if the inter-electron interaction is taken into

The desire to study the manifestation of this interaction stimulates extensive experimental

and theoretical investigation of the process that has particularly intensiﬁed during last ten-

ﬁfteen years (see, e.g., [1, 2]). Although a number of atoms were studied, the primary

attention was given to Helium. At this moment theoretical and experimental investigations

cover the frequency region from the near threshold region up to photon energy ω much

higher than the two-electron ionization potential I ++.

Very close to threshold the two-electron photoionization cross section is determined by

so-called Wannier regime [3] with both electrons strongly repulsing each other that results

in acquiring almost the same energy and moving in opposite directions.

With increase of ω for ω considerably more than I ++, so-called shake-oﬀ (SO) mechanism

[4] became dominant, in which one electron leaves the atom carrying away almost all energy

ω, while the second is removed due to alteration of the ﬁeld acting upon it after the ﬁrst

electron emission. With energy growth so called quasi-free (QF) mechanism [5] becomes

increasingly important. This mechanism accounts for almost equal sharing of photon en-

ergy between photoelectrons, where their interaction on the way out of the ionized atom is

inessential.

Obviously, the cross section of two-electron photoionization σ++(ω) is determined by

initial and ﬁnal state wave function of the considered object - target atom at the beginning

and ion with two continuous spectrum electrons at the end. The situation is simpliﬁed

considerably at high enough ω, where cross sections and other characteristics of the two-

electron ionization are expressed via the initial state wave function only.

In fact, one has to have in mind that two-electron ionization is a pure three-body problem

only for two-electron atom and ions. This process for any other, more complicated objects

is determined by more sophisticated wave functions. This is why most of the attention is
given usually to studies of two-electron photoionization of H −, He and helium-like atoms.
At high ω the σ++ and σ+ have similar ω dependence [6]. Therefore it is convenient to

characterize the process by the ratio R(ω) = σ++(ω)/σ+(ω).

2

The SO leads for ω >> I ++ to R(ω) = RSO (see [7] and references therein). Inclusion

of QF increases R(ω) considerably but at high enough ω the ratio again reaches its ω-

independent value, RQF > RSO [8].

During last time a lot of attention is given to photoionization of not isolated atoms, but

atoms encapsulated into the fullerene, mainly C60 shell (see, e.g.

[9, 10]). The research in

this area until now is pure theoretical. But we are positive, that it will become an object of

experimental studies in not too distant future. It is well known, that C60 radius R is much

bigger than that of the atoms staﬀed inside the so-called endohedral atom, A@C60.

The inclusion of the C60 shell can aﬀect the photoionization atom in four directions. At

ﬁrst, and this is usually taken into account, the photoelectron emitted by A is reﬂected by

the C60 shell that ”works” as a static potential. At second, the C60 shell has its internal

degrees of freedom [11] that can be excited thus modifying the photoionization of the atomic

shells in A@C60 in a similar way that one shell aﬀects the photoionization of the other in

isolated atoms [12]. Among the C60 degrees of freedom the most prominent is the giant

resonance that persists not only in C60 [11], but in its ions as well [13]. Real or virtual

excitations of the giant resonance can modify the A atom photoionization cross section from

almost complete screening at ω

0 to prominent enhancement, at ω in the vicinity of

→

the giant resonance maxima [14, 15]. Note, that at high ω this screening becomes mainly

inessential.

Other two directions of C60 inﬂuence upon the A atom photoionization is the direct knock

out of C60 electrons by the photoelectron from A and the participation of C60 electrons in

the decay, both radiative and non-radiative, of the vacancy, created in A after photon

absorption. Note that this mechanism is similar to one of the frequently discussed channels

of the molecular vacancy decay. The corresponding two possibilities in application to C60

are not yet studied at all.

In this paper we consider a more complex process, namely two-electron photoionization

of He@C60. We will concentrate on the high ω region. Of course, to investigate this process

experimentally is more complicated than one-electron photoionization. However, there are

no indications whatsoever that such an investigation is either impossible (or even extra-

ordinary diﬃcult) or uninteresting.

The role of C60 shell in two-electron photoionization is more complex than in the single-

electron, since outgoing electrons can be either both from the inner atom A, or both from the

3

C60, or one from A and the other from C60. However, by measuring two outgoing electrons

in coincidence we can distinguish all the diﬀerent processes.

We will consider mainly high ω. Having in mind that our aim is study the C60 inﬂuence

upon double ionization, we have to consider the SO mechanism only. Indeed, the QF leads

to two fast electrons, which are not aﬀected by C60, while in SO one of the electrons is slow.

Its probability to leave He@C60 can be therefore strongly aﬀected.

Our attention in this paper will be given to diﬀerential

in energy cross sections

dσ++(ω)/dεs, where εs is the ”slow” photoelectrons energy. It is implied that the ”fast”
I ++. Atomic system of
electron energy εf is given by the conservation law εf = ω
units is accepted in this paper: e = me = ~ = 1, where e and m are electron charge and

εs −

−

mass, respectively.

We will assume that both electrons are removed from the He atom, thus intensionally

neglecting a process that one can call ”A@C60 shake oﬀ”, in which after ”fast” electron leaves

A, the ”slow” electron is emitted by the C60 shell instead of located inside atom A. The

”A@C60 shake oﬀ” is potentially very important due to big number of available for removing

electrons. Therefore, it is possible that ”He@C60 shake oﬀ” is much more probable than the

ordinary one. It is possible, that an important role can be played by multiple ”A@C60 shake

of”, in which not one but several electrons can be removed from C60 after instant creation

of a vacancy in A. One has to have in mind that for an isolated atom A the photoionization
with excitation cross section σ+∗(ω) can be of the order or even bigger than σ++(ω). It is
essential to have in mind that the σ+∗(ω) for A@C60 can be converted into σ++(ω), since
the excitation energy of A+, particularly in the case of He, is bigger than the ionization

potential of C60. We plan, however, to concentrate on ”A@C60 shake oﬀ” in another paper.

II. MAIN FORMULAS

Here Ψi(0, r) is the r1 = 0 value of Ψi(r1, r2), which is in our case the initial state wave

Here n is the principal quantum number of the second electron excitation level.

Now let us consider He@C60 two-electron photoionization and take into account the C60

shell. It is clear that C60 potential does not aﬀect the ”fast” electron, which remains to be

described by a plane wave. The C60 shell generates potential ﬁeld that is almost uniform at

atomic distances ra, where the initial state of He is located. Therefore, for the initial state

the embedding of an atom A into C60 can lead only to the shift of the energy scale, i.e., to

modiﬁcation of the ionization threshold. This feature is inessential for us, since ω >> I ++.

Thus, we have to take into account the action of C60 upon the slow outgoing electron. The

fullerene is a very complex structure. Therefore, to take into account its action upon photo-

electron essential simpliﬁcations are necessary. We will follow here the approach developed

in a number of papers (see [17, 18] and references therein), that substitutes the complicated

C60 multi-atomic structure by a very simple so-called bubble potential V (r) = V0δ(r

where V0 is chosen to reproduce the aﬃnity energy of the negative ion C60, and δ(r

R),

−
R) is

−

Dirac delta function.

As it was demonstrated in [18] and [19] in connection to the one-electron photoionization,

the inﬂuence of the bubble potential can be taken into account analytically, by constructing

the outgoing wave function as a superposition of regular ϕεl(r) and irregular χεl(r) (singular

at r

→

0) solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for an electron with energy ε.

Inside

the potential bubble the photoelectron wave function ψεl(r) diﬀers from ϕεl(r) only by a

normalization factor Dl(ε) : ψεl(r) = Dl(ε)ϕεl(r). The factor Dl(ε) depends upon the

5

photoelectron energy ε, with l being its electron angular momentum. Outside the δ-sphere

the function ψεl(r) is a linear combination of ϕεl(r) and χεl(r). The coeﬃcients of the linear

combination are deﬁned by the matching conditions of the wave functions on the spherical

shell, i.e., at r = R.

In the δ-potential approximation the diﬀerential two-electron photoionization of He@C60

is thus given by formula similar to (1), that includes, however the factor Dl(ε):

Here ukl(R) and vkl(R) are functions connected to the radial parts of regular ϕεl(r) and

the discontinuity of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function at r = R, connected to

the fullerene radius R and the electron aﬃnity If of the empty C60 through the expression

∆L =

β(1 + coth βR),

where β =

2If . The formula obtained are valid for low enough energies of the ”slow”

photoelectron. Namely, its wave length should be much bigger than the thickness of the

p

fullerene shell.

At ﬁrst one should calculate the ratio of diﬀerential cross sections (4) to (2) RC60(ε) that

according to Eqs.(3) and (4) is independent upon ω

Since ϕε0(r) and χεl(r) are pure Coulomb functions, the functions ukl and vkl (from

Eqs.(6,7)) are expressed via the regular Fl(η, ρ) and irregular Gl(η, ρ) Coulomb wave func-

tion, respectively. Namely, one has ukl(r) = Fl(

Z
k , kr) and vkl(r) = Gl(

Z
k , kr), i.e. regular

−

−

and irregular Coulomb wave functions that can be found in [20].

Let us note that the formula (7) can be extended to lower ω. Indeed, the interaction

between two ionized electrons is particularly essential near ionization threshold ω

I ++,

≥

where Wannier regime prevails. It is known that already several eV above threshold the

Wannier expressions are no more valid. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that at about

10eV the interaction between outgoing electrons is inessential. One of them is represented

by an s-wave, while the other by a p-wave, in order to preserve the total initial state angular

momentum that is zero for He@C60 and l = 1 for the photon. Due to action of the C60 shell

the second electrons wave function is modiﬁed in the same way as ϕε0(r) in (2). Thus, it is

reasonable to expect that to take this action into account one has to introduce the factor

D1(ε)

2 into (7). As a result, one obtains instead of Eq.(7) the following expression:

III. DETAILS OF CALCULATIONS

First of all, one should notice that the term k/∆L in denominator of Eq.(5) was taken

with the sign ”minus”, whereas there was ”plus” in the Ref.[18, 19]. This is because the

authors of the latter references used the irregular Coulomb functions vkl(r) =

vkl(r), whilst

−

we used the Coulomb functions vkl(r) presented in the Handbook [20].

The Eqs.(9-11) include the function D1(ε) at ε = 0, for ε = ω

I ++. It is clear that
−
k , kr), presented in the expression (5) for D2
l ,
have singularities at zero energy, i.e. at k = 0 that corresponds to ε = 0. However,

the Coulomb functions Fl(

Z
k , kr) and Gl(

−

the presentations of Coulomb functions given in [20] enable to obtain the following limit

relations:

(13)

Here γ is Euler’s constant, Jµ(x) is a usual Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind, and p(α) is the

following sum, which is inﬁnite but rapidly convergent: p(α) =

with the initial values P0 = 1, P1 = 0. Functions gl(Z, r) for l > 0 could be then obtained

by using Eqs.(12)-(14) and the following recurrence relation

gl(Z, r)fl−1(Z, r) = gl−1(Z, r)fl(Z, r) +

l
Z

.

The latter is a consequence of the Wronskian relation (see Eq.(14.2.5) in Ref.[20]) for the

regular and irregular Coulomb functions. Note that Eq.(12) for the regular Coulomb func-

tions could be found in numerous handbooks on non-relativistic quantum mechanics (see,

e.g. Ref.(13)), within the accuracy of a normalization factor. However, we did not ﬁnd in

scientiﬁc literature the corresponding relations (13)-(15) for irregular Coulomb functions.

Using the limit relations (12)-(15), one could present Eq.(5) for the zero energy in the

form:

D2

l (0) =

[(∆L)gl(Z, R)fl(Z, R)

1]2 + (∆L)2f 4

l (Z, R)

.

(16)

(15)

In particular, for the helium atom expression (16) yields: D2

0(0) = 1.38590 and D2

1(0) =

3.09129.

The function Ψi can be obtained using variational principle that minimizes the initial

state energy. One has to have in mind, that, generally speaking, this procedure is able to

reproduce initial state energy absolutely accurate, leading to wave function that satisﬁes the

precise Schrodinger equation for two electrons in the ﬁeld of a nucleus with the charge Z. In

its practical implementations, however, the variation wave functions reproduces the initial

energy approximately and therefore is good on the average.

As to photoionization, since one of the outgoing electrons is fast, its wave function is a

plane wave with a wavelength short in the atomic scale. Therefore, photoeﬀect is able to

test the short range behavior of Ψi(r1, r2), namely, as it is seen from Eq.(1), Ψi(0, r).

This is why instead of a variational, we use a locally correct wave function [22, 23, 24],

that describes with high accuracy the two-electron photoionization [16] and some average

characteristics of the initial state.

IV. RESULTS OF CALCULATIONS

Here we presented the results of our calculations for the two-electron photoionization of

He@C60. For this object the radius R = 6.64a.u. and the electron aﬃnity of the empty

C60 is equal to If = 2.65eV . The initial state of He considered in this paper is i = 1s, i.e.

l = 0. The results for RC60(ε) from Eq.(7) are presented in Fig.1 together with the function

D2

1(ε) from the Eqs.(9-11). As it was expected and similar to the case of one-electron

photoionization, the ratio RC60(ε) is a strongly oscillating function of ε.

Fig.(2) depicts RC60(ω, ε), given by Eq.(9) for several ω as functions of ε.

It is not

incidental, that the curves behavior at ε = 0 and ε = ω

I ++ are diﬀerent. This is because

−

one of the electron is represented by an s-wave while the other by p-wave.

Note that RC60(ω, ε) becomes a prominently variating curve already for ω

I ++

20eV .

For ω

Fig.(3) presents the results for the ratio Ri,f ul(ω) determined by Eq.(8). As one could

see, with ω growth this ratio rapidly approaches the asymptotic value Ri,f ul →
that in Eq.(8) we assumed that ”slow” electron wave function is modiﬁed by the C60 shell.

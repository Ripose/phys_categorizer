We derive and apply an optical Bloch equation (OBE) model for describing collisions of ground
and excited laser cooled alkali atoms in the presence of near-resonant light. Typically these collisions
lead to loss of atoms from traps. We compare the results obtained with a quantum mechanical
complex potential treatment, semiclassical Landau-Zener models with decay, and a quantum time-
dependent Monte-Carlo wave packet (MCWP) calculation. We formulate the OBE method in both
adiabatic and diabatic representations. We calculate the laser intensity dependence of collision
probabilities and ﬁnd that the adiabatic OBE results agree quantitatively with those of the MCWP
calculation, and qualitatively with the semiclassical Landau-Zener model with delayed decay, but
that the complex potential method or the traditional Landau-Zener model fail in the saturation
limit.

I. INTRODUCTION

Collision dynamics of cold atoms in laser traps have been extensively investigated over the past few years. When
the red detuning ∆ from the atomic resonance frequency is large compared to the natural decay rate γ, we ﬁnd a
photoassociation spectrum of isolated bound vibrational-rotational levels in the attractive excited state potentials.
This is now a highly developed subject and is fairly well understood, see the review [1]. In contrast, when ∆ is small,
on the order of γ, the mechanisms and rate coeﬃcients of trap loss processes which result from photoexcitation of the
diatomic quasimolecule at long range are still rather poorly understood theoretically [2,3], in spite of the numerous
experimental studies of this subject [4].

The reason for this is twofold: real hyperﬁne structure introduces much complexity into the collision dynamics,
and the prominent role of excited state spontaneous decay during the very long time scale of the collision is diﬃcult
to calculate quantum mechanically. The number of degrees of freedom associated with the spontaneous emission is,
of course, inﬁnite. Adiabatically eliminating these degrees of freedom leads to a mixed state representation that can
not be described in terms of wavefunctions but requires solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for the quantum
mechanical density matrix ρ(R, R′; t) [5]:

ρ(R, R′; t) =

[H(R)ρ(R, R′; t)

where H(R) = T (R) + V (R) is the system Hamiltonian for kinetic energy T (R) and interaction potential V (R), and
Γ is the decay tensor. Thus, the theoretical treatment of cold atom collisions serves as both prototype and paradigm
for new constructs to treat non-equilibrium open systems coupled to reservoirs. Since the direct solution of Eq. (1) for
cold collision situations is beyond currently available computational resources [6,7], approximate methods for treating
the collision dynamics in light ﬁelds must be developed.

The methods currently available are the semiclassical local equilibrium model of Gallagher and Pritchard [8] or
Julienne and Vigu´e [9], the semiclassical dynamical Landau-Zener models [10–13], the semiclassical optical Bloch
equation (OBE) method [14], the quantum complex potential method [10,15,16], and the Monte Carlo wave packet
method of simulating the full quantum density matrix [11–13]. Although the latter is capable in principle of treating
the full quantum dissipative dynamics for an arbitrary number of coupled states in arbitrarily strong laser ﬁelds, the
method is extremely computer intensive, and therefore slow and impractical. The complex potential method can treat

−

fast many coupled channels quantum mechanically, including bound state resonances, but only in the limit of very
weak laser ﬁelds where no more than one excitation and decay event per collision occurs.

The semiclassical methods are very appealing because of their computational tractability, simple interpretation
and physical picture of the collision. However, several fully quantum calculations [11–13] have shown that both the
local equilibrium and semiclassical OBE methods (in the formulation given in Ref. [14]) give incorrect results by an
order of magnitude or more for detunings of a few γ or less for temperature T < 1 mK, depending on species. So
γ which is fully
far no practical theory exists for ultracold collisions for realistic atoms in a light ﬁeld with ∆
quantum mechanical and also capable of treating dissipation and decay. Therefore, there is not yet any satisfactory
description of trap loss rates in the small detuning limit. For large detunings, ∆
γ, collision in a light ﬁeld goes to
photoassociation spectroscopy, in which isolated molecular bound vibrational levels are excited. Resonant scattering
theory does then an excellent job of explaining the excitation rate [1,17].

Quantum calculations have shown that semiclassical methods may still be useful in characterizing cold collisions
in a light ﬁeld with ∆
γ [11–13]. The local equilibrium model for cold collisions place a prominent emphasis
on oﬀ-resonant quasimolecular excitation outside the region around the Condon point RC . In contrast to them, a
semiclassical picture based on localized Landau-Zener excitation near RC with subsequent semiclassical evolution with
decay inside RC gives an excellent representation of the quantum dynamics for T near 1 mK, when compared with
results obtained from quantum mechanical calculations. The Landau-Zener model only begins to fail near T = 1 µK
and at large intensities [12]. Therefore, since there still seems to be good opportunities for semiclassical models,
we have revisited the OBE method, and provided a rigorous derivation of the velocity-corrected semiclassical OBE
equations starting with the appropriate quantum mechanical equations (replacing the unsatisfactory approach used
in Ref. [14]). We show that an adiabatic rather than a diabatic formulation of the semiclassical OBE equations gives
quite good agreement with the quantum methods, even at saturation, in contrast to the poor agreement provided by
the diabatic treatment.

We ﬁnd that the adiabatic OBE calculations are in good agreement with the MCWP results and time-independent
complex potential results (used for weak laser ﬁelds where this method is appropriate), down to low collision tem-
peratures. Only upon increasing the laser detuning above the onset of resonances due to bound state structure does
the adiabatic OBE method fail [10]. We also use an improved Landau-Zener model with dissipation [13] which works
even in the presence of strong saturation, where the complex potential method fails. This model oﬀers a qualitative
understanding of the strong ﬁeld processes. The numerical comparisons are for the standard two-state model on which
the quantum and other semiclassical models have heretofore been tested. Although these test calculations ignore the
complex multistate structure introduced by molecular hyperﬁne structure, the hope is that semiclassical methods can
yet be developed that are capable of treating the complexity of multistate collision dynamics in the presence of decay.
This paper is constructed as follows. Section II presents the model of trap loss processes we shall use in order
to test the methods developed and employed. Section III contains the derivation of the OBE method using the
two diﬀerent bases. Section IV describes the Monte-Carlo method which serves as the standard against which the
approximate methods we use are compared. Section V describes the complex potential method. Section VI develops
the generalized Landau-Zener approach to strong laser ﬁeld cold atom collisions. Section VII presents the comparison
of the numerical results from the various methods, and Sec. VIII contains a summary and conclusion.

II. THE QUASIMOLECULE MODEL FOR COLD COLLISIONS

The basic loss processes for atom traps due to cold collisions are ﬁne-structure change (FS) and radiative escape
(RE) [8,9]; these are demonstrated in Fig. 1. Due to the low temperatures we can consider the collision of two atoms
as internal dynamics of a diatomic quasimolecule. The simplest prototype model for the FS mechanism consists of
three collision channels, i.e., quasimolecule states. The model described here is identical to that used in Ref. [18]. We
ignore any rotational structure, i.e., only the s-wave is considered, but the model can be extended to higher partial
waves. Here the three channels are: the ground 2S1/2 + 2S1/2 state channel labelled g, the excited 2S1/2 + 2P3/2
state channel labelled e and a probe channel (correlating asymptotically with 2S1/2 + 2P1/2 state) labelled p.

In the FS mechanism the system starts on channel g, and is later excited at the Condon point RC to the channel
e, which has an attractive potential. When the atom reaches the crossing between the potentials for the e and p
channels, it may enter the p channel and eventually come out of the collision having gained as kinetic energy the
energy diﬀerence between the 2S1/2 + 2P3/2 and 2S1/2 + 2P1/2 states. This gain is large enough to propel atoms
from the shallow trap.

In the RE mechanism the quasimolecule decays back from the e channel to the g channel via spontaneous emission.
If this decay does not take place too early, the acceleration on channel e will give the atoms enough kinetic energy to
escape from the trap.

FIG. 1. The basic trap loss mechanisms. The ﬁgures show the quasimolecule potentials as functions of the internuclear
separation R. The corresponding asymptotic combinations of the atomic states are also given.
In (a) we demonstrate the
ﬁne-structure change (FS) loss mechanism. The quasimolecule is excited from the ground state g to the state e, then it moves
towards small R, where it is transferred to the p state at R = Rin. Finally the atoms exit the collision on this state, sharing a
kinetic energy increase equal to ∆E. In (b) the excited state e decays back to the ground state (g) after the atoms have gained
enough kinetic energy (∆E) to escape from the trap. This is the radiative escape mechanism (RE). If decay takes place too
soon, i.e., at R > Rin, then the escape turns into heating due to insuﬃcient increase in the kinetic energy (the trap depth is
not exceeded).

For both mechanisms we need to ﬁnd out the probability for the quasimolecule to reach a certain internuclear
distance Rin while still remaining on the channel e. This can be obtained from calculations by monitoring the
quantum ﬂux Je(R) on channel e directly as is done when using the OBE method, the MCWP method and the
Landau-Zener approaches (two-state case). Alternatively we can monitor the population transferred to the probe
channel p, as happens in the complex potential method (three-state case).

We need a treatment that contains both the laser-induced excitation at RC from g to e, and survival on e. Fur-
thermore, for strong ﬁelds a proper model must allow any decayed population to be excited back to e if the decay has
taken place in the vicinity of RC . Only the MCWP method and the OBE approach can handle this reexcitation (also
called population recycling) quantitatively. Further discussion on the subtle aspects of these loss mechanisms can be
found e.g. in Refs. [2–4,9].

It should be pointed out that the OBE method, the MCWP method (as we apply it in this paper), and the Landau-
Zener approaches are “one-way” studies. We only consider the ﬂux going in, but do not allow for any outcoming
ﬂux. For estimating the FS and RE loss this is adequate as long as the detuning of the laser is about 1-10 atomic
linewidths. Then the role of bound states in the loss mechanisms is not too important yet; see Ref. [10] for more
discussion. For strong ﬁelds the power broadening also diminishes the role of the bound states; most of the loss is
due to processes associated with the ﬁrst passage of the critical point Rin on the channel e.

We have earlier in a short article [18] presented the results obtained with the adiabatic OBE method and the MCWP
method in the strong ﬁeld regime, and discussed the physical implications of the results (the lack of saturation in trap
loss when excitation becomes saturated). In this paper we study in detail the various theoretical approaches, present
the general derivation of the OBE equations and their application to the two-state case (Sec. III) and show how to
extend the Landau-Zener approach to the strong ﬁeld regime as suggested in Ref. [13] in the case of optical shielding.

In studies using diﬀerent laser parameters we have selected for a suitable inner distance Rin = 143 a0, although the
methods that we use allow the determination of Je(R) for all values of R. The atomic excited state has a linewidth
γat = 5.13 MHz, and we have taken the molecular linewidth to be γ = (4/3)γat, independent of R. And as mentioned
before, we consider only the case l = 0.

A reasonably complete description of cold atom collision dynamics in laser traps can be obtained via the time-
dependent density matrix ρ(R, R′; t) satisfying the Liouville equation (1). The probability of reaching the inner
region on the excited state potential (or the particle ﬂux in the inner region on the excited state potential) can be
determined directly from the diagonal density matrix elements ρii(Rin, Rin; t). However, the direct numerical solution
for the density matrix is presently beyond our capabilities for the cold atom collision problem. Instead we shall use
various approximations to solve for the dynamics. The time-dependent MCWP approach basically includes all the
physics contained in the Liouville equation, and it will provide the standard against which all other methods are to
be judged.

Our model is a simpliﬁed representation of the true collision situation. Experiments have shown that inclusion of
hyperﬁne structure is necessary to properly treat the collisions of laser cooled alkali species [4,19]. It is exactly for this
reason that it is so important to develop simple and accurate approximate numerical methods that can conceivably
be used on problems including hyperﬁne dynamics where a large number of channels is required to treat the manifold
of the hyperﬁne states.

In this section we derive the semiclassical optical Bloch equations. We start with the Liouville equation (1) and use

(3)

Here we have explicitly written out the kinetic and potential energy parts of the Hamiltonian H; the term V (R)
contains the potentials for the internal states of the quasimolecule and couplings between them. We assume that V
has no time-dependence as we have eliminated the oscillating laser ﬁeld terms using the rotating wave approximation
and an appropriate phase shift (here V contains the potentials U and couplings ¯hΩ).

It should be pointed out that our description is time-dependent, so instead of the boundary conditions used in the
time-independent scattering theory we have an initial value problem, i.e., we solve Eq. (3) starting at t = t0 with
some initial density matrix ρ(R, R′; t0). If Eq. (3) corresponds to a closed system (no decay out of the selected set of
levels), then ρ can have steady state solutions.

Typically one takes as the initial state the steady state result corresponding to atoms being well separated, with
the quasimolecule potentials being ﬂat over the distance that the system moves within the time it takes to establish
the steady state. In other words, the molecular potentials do not impose any dynamics that would interfere with the
steady state formation.

In time-independent scattering theory the initial conditions can not be stated in terms of diabatic states if couplings
between the states do not disappear asymptotically, as is the case with laser-induced quasimolecule processes. However,
since the system at large R evolves quickly into the local steady state, which is independent of the selected basis states,
there is no a priori reason to regard the adiabatic basis better than the diabatic basis. In practice one tends to choose
the diabatic basis, because it allows a simple description of the spontaneous emission processes. Furthermore, as
discussed later, we can select any initial state in any basis, if we allow the system initially enough time to reach locally
at large R a steady state before the spatial dependence of the quasimolecule potentials will couple the steady state
formation and molecular dynamics.

We assume for simplicity that in our current description Γ is independent of position, but it is easy to extend our
treatment to allow R dependence in Γ; such dependence can easily arise if retardation eﬀects are properly included
to the quasimolecule potentials and lifetimes. We redeﬁne our spatial coordinate system by writing R = r + q/2,
R′ = r

The density matrix ρ(R, R′; t) contains information about the spatial coherences in the system. In order to calculate
quantum ﬂuxes at some interatomic distance R we do not need all that information, but only the spatially diagonal
elements ρ(R, R; t). However, the evolution of these diagonal elements depends on the oﬀ-diagonal ρ(R, R′; t) elements.

Here we have used the fact that there is no p-dependence on the right-hand side of Eq. (6), so that if we perform the
momentum integration ﬁrst, we obtain a δ(q) function, and thus the integration over q merely sets q = 0.

If a convenient method of evaluating the kinetic term were available, we could use the result (8) to obtain exactly
the diagonal elements of ˜ρ at given r and t, ˜ρii(r, t), which is the probability of being in channel i at position r and
time t. However, since we do not have any exact methods for calculating the second term in Eq. (8), we shall estimate
it using a WKB approach. The WKB approximation for the density matrix element is given by

and ai(R, t) is the amplitude factor for the WKB wave. We consider only the incoming wave, which ﬁxes the sign of
the β terms, and assume that ai and pi do not depend on position very strongly. Furthermore, we assume that the
classical momenta pi(R) are non-zero and real. It should be noted that by introducing the classical momenta we have

It should be noted that our deﬁnition (11) of the classical momenta is clearly diﬀerent from the one encountered in
the traditional scattering theory, if we consider the asymptotic situation. In the time-independent theory the channels
(states) are typically either open or closed, depending on the collision energy, i.e., their classical (WKB) momenta are
asymptotically either real or imaginary. This is because they are deﬁned as pscatt

where i = 0 corresponds to the channel of the ingoing wave, deﬁned by the asymptotic boundary conditions.

The diﬀerence here is due to the presence of the relaxation terms in Eq. (3), and is required by the asymptotic

situation. In the time-dependent treatment we have pi(
because asymptotically we have a steady state formation which is not coupled to the dynamics because the potentials
are ﬂat. For simplicity we base our following discussion on a two-state system. Assuming that the excited state and
ground state populations had diﬀerent asymptotic momenta, the steady state formation (the cycles of excitation and
decay) quickly mixes these populations and eventually the distribution of momentum on the ground state and the
excited state would be exactly equal. In other words, because of decay we can have asymptotic population even on
a closed channel, but this population is a steady state reﬂection of the ground state population and must have the
same classical momentum. Although in the above discussion we have assumed the diabatic basis, it is quite valid in
the adiabatic basis, where the relaxation leads to a similar asymptotic mixing between the channels. Finally, as we
ﬁx the asymptotic situation by using Eq. (3), we introduce other problems, which will be discussed in Sec. III C.

Here we have assumed that the classical momenta vary so little with r that they can be taken outside the derivative
term.

Our aim is to ﬁnd the total incoming quantum ﬂux at each position r (integrated over all times), and thus we are
not interested in the actual time dependence. This simpliﬁes our model to a great extent. Now the total ﬂux can be
obtained as a steady state result from Eq. (14). Since our model corresponds to a “one-way” situation, the steady
state ﬂux at r is equal to the total ﬂux that has passed that point. In the steady state the time derivative in Eq. (14)
vanishes, and we can replace ˜ρij(r, t) by

This completes the general derivation of the semiclassical optical Bloch equations using the Wigner distribution. The
set of equations (16) were obtained by making a semiclassical approximation, which focuses on classical paths by
virtue of using the WKB approximation. Only when the semiclassical approximation is valid (when the de Broglie
wavelength is smaller than the region where the potentials are varying) will this approximation be meaningful.

The above derivation was done in the diabatic representation of the quasimolecule potentials. The decay term Γ has
a simple form in this representation, where the electronic states are also independent of position, and the internal states
are directly coupled by the standard dipole term. In the adiabatic representation the electronic wavefunctions vary
with the internuclear coordinate R. In this presentation the laser-induced couplings and the decay term become clearly
R dependent. We can move from the simple diabatic representation into the adiabatic one, in which the potential
matrix V (which contains the radiative coupling) is diagonal. The transformation matrix C(R) is R dependent,

where E(R) is the diagonal eigenvalue matrix that gives the ﬁeld-dressed quasimolecule potentials. We can now write
the diabatic semiclassical density matrix in terms of the adiabatic semiclassical density matrix ρa

Another method for deriving the adiabatic OBE equations of motion involves using the half-collision matrix
method [20]. This method yields the same result as given by Eqs. (20) and (22) for the Hamiltonian part of the
dynamics, but can not be used to derive the decay part of the adiabatic OBE equations, since the half-collision
method does not incorporate the dissipative dynamics due to spontaneous emission contained in the density matrix
treatment.

B. The two-state case

We assume that our quasimolecule has only two states, one ground state (1) and one excited state (2), with
potentials V11 and V22. In our trap loss model these states are as shown in Fig. 2. The excited state has a constant
width γ, and the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements (ρ12 and ρ21) have the width 1

2 γ. Thus we have

and rest of the elements of Γ are zero. Using V12 as the coupling between the states, we get the diabatic equations

C. The implementation of the two-state case

The optical Bloch equations (24)-(27) and (32)-(35) can be solved numerically using various methods. As will be
discussed in Sec. VII, the diabatic formulation fails when T < 1 mK for all coupling strengths Ω.
If we use the
adiabatic equations (32)-(35), with the velocity factors given by Eq. (11), we ﬁnd a good agreement with the MCWP
results for all temperatures at large couplings, but an increasing deviation with decreasing Ω. Of course, we would
like to have an approach which is good for all T and Ω. Thus we need to look into the issue of velocity factors in
detail.

The velocity factor va

2 for the upper adiabatic potential (see Fig. 2) is the source of the problem here. When the
atoms approach each other, a steady state is quickly formed and maintained until the system gets very close to RC .
As discussed earlier, this gives us the advantage of a basis-independent initial state. At this point the population
on the upper adiabatic state 2 is a steady state reﬂection of the population of the lower adiabatic state 1. Thus
when the system reaches the Condon point the probability ﬂux on both adiabatic states ought in fact have the same
momentum. Thus, if we use the velocity factor given by Eq. (11) for the upper adiabatic state, we get the right velocity
asymptotically, but the wrong velocity at the crossing. We can correct this by redeﬁning va
2E/µ
for all R.

2 (R) so that va

2 =

In other words, because the OBE approach mixes concepts from time-dependent theory (steady state formation)
and time-independent theory (WKB wave functions), we must sometimes improve its performance by such a tun-
ing. Here we need to give the WKB wave functions asymptotically the velocities which describe the steady state
situation correctly, but at the crossing the dynamics dominates, implying that the classical momenta used in the
time-independent theory would provide a more accurate description. Deviations are visible in the limit of the weak
excitation, because then the excited state population is dominated by the small steady state contribution which, due
to the large momentum given incorrectly by Eq. (11), has a good chance to survive on the excited state until R = Rin.
This population overwhelms the contribution from the dynamical excitation, and gives thus incorrect results. How-
ever, as will be shown in Sec. VII, we now have a method that can predict correctly the probability to reach small R
on channel e for any practical Ω, and for the temperatures in the cold collisions regime. It should be noted that an
extension of our approach to ultracold temperature regime, i.e., below the recoil limit, is not likely to succeed, as the
semiclassical viewpoint fails in this regime [21,22].

p

The previous formulation of optical Bloch equations [14] was done in the time frame rather than in the position
frame. The transition between these two frames was performed by introducing a reference trajectory v0(R), which
mapped R to t. However, as noted in Ref.
[14], this reference trajectory is not really needed as we can do the
calculation in the R frame altogether.

In practice when solving the optical Bloch equations we can set all σij (R0) = 0, except selecting one state for which
σii(R0) = 1. The value of R0 is set suitably large for the atoms to be well apart and potentials ﬂat. Since the classical
trajectory couples R and t, evolution in R corresponds to evolution in t and we ﬁnd that the system has evolved into a
steady state distribution of the ground and excited state populations after moving a relatively short distance towards
smaller R. This corresponds to numerically determining the asymptotic state state populations and coherences.

IV. MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS

A direct wave packet treatment of Eq. (1) with numerical methods is possible [6,7]. However, since one has to
operate with a two-dimensional spatial grid, the memory sizes currently available in computers strongly limit the use
of this approach: only models which are simpliﬁed in the extreme can be studied. In cold collisions the acceleration
of the initially slow wave packet on the steep excited state potential surface forces us to use a large two-dimensional
momentum space while at the same time good momentum resolution is needed to deﬁne adequately the narrow initial
wave packet for low temperatures. Similar demands are set for the position space as well; for more detailed discussion
see Refs. [7,11]. Hence we need many grid points in order to span properly the required regions in both the momentum
and position spaces.

It may be feasible to avoid some of the computational problems by using grid sizes and resolutions which are
adaptive; one might utilize the rather deterministic behavior of the wave packet by altering the computational grid
properties either as a function of position or time. Then the straightforward swapping between momentum and
position representations using fast Fourier transforms is, however, usually lost. We have chosen to approach the
problem from another angle. The Monte Carlo wave packet (MCWP) method allows us to treat Eq. (1) numerically
as a one-dimensional problem. Unlike other approximative methods this approach does not adapt any concepts from
classical mechanics and, therefore, it is not a semiclassical tool but a fully quantum one. Hence it can be used as a
benchmark for the diﬀerent semiclassical methods described in this article.

By using the MCWP method we can greatly diminish the limitations set by the available computer memory.
However, this gain is partially reduced by the increase in the time required by the computation. Hence the MCWP
simulations are quite time-consuming, and therefore the need for other approaches is quite acute. There are several
Monte-Carlo approaches available currently, and we use the Dalibard-Castin-Mølmer version [23], adapted to wave
packet problems in the manner described in Refs. [6,11,13]. We shall give here a brief description of the method, but
keep the main emphasis on aspects related to the particular system studied in this article.

In the MCWP method one does not directly solve the time evolution of the density matrix itself. Instead, we look

at the time evolution of the state vector

10

Ψ(R, t) =

Ψg(R, t)
Ψe(R, t)

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(36)

where Ψg and Ψe are the ground and excited state probability amplitudes, respectively. In this model the spontaneous
decay appears as random quantum jumps during the time evolution of the state vector. Hence each time we solve the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation we obtain a unique state vector evolution, also called a wave packet history. One
can form a ﬁnite ensemble of such histories and calculate ensemble averaged expectation values for physical quantities.
These values are approximations to those provided by the full density matrix treatment. The accuracy of the ensemble
averages tends to increase with the number of members in the ensemble, and in the limit of an inﬁnite ensemble these
averages and the density matrix results become equal, as shown e.g. in Ref. [23]. So, we expect that by accumulating
ensemble members we can eventually reach a suitable accuracy at some ﬁnite ensemble size. The accuracy to be
expected of the method is decribed in Ref. [23]. For wave packets in cold collision problems the appropriate ensemble
size seems to be roughly 50 members, assuming that all the histories are very close to each other in the phase space
for all times. This is quite true for the excited state survival studies related to attractive excited states. In general
such localisation in the phase space for all times is necessary for the success of the semiclassical approaches.

We start the calculation of the state vector evolution from some initial state, which in our case is a Gaussian
wave packet on the ground state moving towards small R. The wave packet in general describes the probability to
2 contain
ﬁnd the two colliding atoms at certain relative separation R, and its components
Ψe(R, t)
|
|
the additional information how this probability is distributed between the ground and excited states. A Fourier
transform of the state vector Ψ(R, t) takes the system into the momentum representation. We set the initial phase
which corresponds to
of Ψg in position representation such that the wave packet starts with a mean momentum
the temperature of the cloud of cooled and trapped atoms. The width of the wave packet is chosen so that it remains
relatively narrow in both representations. We cannot, of course, violate the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, so it
is impossible to have inﬁnitely narrow packets in either representation. It should be pointed out that apart from
satisfying the Heisenberg uncertainty relation the width of the wave packet is not related to any of the macroscopic
quantities of the physical situation which we try to simulate.

Initially the wave packet is located far from the crossing so that a steady state between the ground and excited
states can form before the wave packet reaches the interaction region where the dipole-dipole interaction makes the
laser resonant with the molecular transition. The time scale for the formation of the steady state is roughly 3-5 times
the decay time scale 1/γmol [24], assuming that the local detuning does not change much over the distance covered by
the wave packet during that time. As discussed before, the steady state formation allows us to put the initial wave
packet on the diabatic ground state even when the laser-induced coupling is large asymptotically, because the ﬁnal
steady state is independent of the initial state. Indeed, we could even place the initial wave packet on the excited
state, and yet the wave packet approaching the crossing would still be the steady state one.

The state vector corresponding to the initial state is stepped forward in time with its evolution determined by the
Schr¨odinger equation. Various numerical methods can be used, and we have applied the combination of split operator
approach with Crank-Nicholson and Runge-Kutta algorithms, described in detail in Ref. [11]. In the MCWP method
one uses an eﬀective Hamiltonian,

¯hγ

where H is the system Hamiltonian, γ is the decay rate for the excited state population and σ+ and σ− are the
standard spinor raising and lowering operators, respectively.

where Pe(t) is the current excited state population. By rewriting δs as dPe we would end up with the standard

[0, 1]. A quantum jump occurs when η < δs; this is usually the less likely situation since
with a random number η

the basic assumption in the derivation of the MCWP method is that δs

1/γ). When a jump occurs one simply replaces Ψg(R, t + δt) with Ψe(R, t + δt), and then sets Ψe(R, t + δt) = 0.
The occurrence of the jump corresponds to the observation of a ﬂuorecence photon, which reduces the wave function:
before the jump it had to be in the excited state, and after the jump it must be in the ground state. The important
aspect is that as the jump takes place the position and momentum properties of the excited state component of the
state vector are transfered to the ground state component. This is the source of radiative heating, among other things.
Both the evolution under Heﬀ and the quantum jumps reduce the norm of the state vector Ψ. Hence after each
time step the state vector is renormalized to unity, even if a jump does not occur. It should be noted that if we had

≪

11

Heﬀ = H, then we would always observe a quantum jump for a system with non-zero Pe if we wait long enough.
For cases where Pe < 1 this would be wrong, since there is a non-zero probability that the system never was on the
excited state. In the weak ﬁeld limit Pe is always very small, so most of the ensemble members correspond to the
time evolution under the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with no interruption by jumps. Then the wave packet approach
reduces to a time-dependent version of the complex potential approach. Therefore a single ensemble member becomes
a reasonably accurate approximation to the density matrix result. We have used this property in our weak ﬁeld
study [12], and have thus veriﬁed that the diabatic formulation of the OBE method does not work properly at low
temperatures, but the Landau-Zener approach and the complex potential method can be used instead.

Although the MCWP method allows us to use relatively large grids, the strong change in the excited state potential
corresponds at our probing distance Rin = 143 a0 to kinetic energies which are beyond the numerical treatment.
Basically it becomes impossible to correctly track the relevant quantum mechanical phase term exp(
iEδt/¯h), where
E is the kinetic energy of the wave packet. Hence we must cut the excited state potential change by making it ﬂat
for Rin < R < Rcut; in our studies we have used the value Rcut = 512 a0. At Rcut we are basically left with the
exponential decay of the excited state population because of the large local detuning. Hence we can take the wave
packet result for Je(R) from R = Rcut to Rin by multiplying it with exp(
γttrans), where ttrans is the time it takes to
go from Rcut to Rin along the classical path determined by the local velocity. In fact, the same approach is also applied
when the OBE equations are solved numerically: otherwise the adequate determination of the term exp[
ip(R)δR/¯h]
would require unpractically small values of the spatial grid spacing δR (here p(R) is the local momentum at R) when
R < Rcut.

V. COMPLEX POTENTIAL CALCULATIONS

In the complex potential method one adds a complex term on the excited state potential in order to describe decay
out of these states [10,15,16]. This approach does not allow any reexcitation, and is thus not appropriate for strong
ﬁeld studies directly (by including the photon states explicitly one might improve the model although this would
drastically increase the number of channels required to solve even the case of two quasimolecule states [16]).

In this method one simply uses the Hamiltonian

For this method we have explicitly included the probe channel p to our Hamiltonian: Up(R) is the corresponding
potential. The probe channel p crosses the e channel potential at Rin. Because of the disparity between RC (∆) and
Rin the outer zone excitation process is in practice well separated from the inner zone process. The coupling Ωep
depends on the nature of the coupling of the excited state and the probe channel.

We have used the invariant imbedding method [15,25] (in the diabatic representation) to solve the above close
coupling equations in a form that directly computes the S matrix elements, Sgp and Sep, from which the quantum
ﬂux Je(R), i.e., the quantum mechanical probability of reaching the inner zone, is determined. In the complex potential
calculations we use mainly the same values for parameters as in the two-state model, given in Sec. II. However, here

As we are now working with the time-independent scattering theory, we need to consider boundary conditions
instead of initial ones. Since the model potential contains non-vanishing oﬀ-diagonal elements, for strong ﬁelds there
is a clear mixing of states at large R. Therefore the boundary condition for the complex potential approach has to be
deﬁned in terms of the ﬁeld-dressed, i.e., adiabatic states. The transformation between the diﬀerent bases then takes
place as described in Sec. III. We assume an incoming wave (corresponding to the asymptotic collision energy E) on
the lower adiabatic channel formed by states g and e (state 1 in Fig. 2).

i.e., the probability to exit on channel p as

In the limit of large detuning and small laser intensity it is safe to assume that the excitation becomes localized to
the Condon point RC . In this limit the dynamical models and the local equilibrium model tends to agree. In local
equilibrium models one assumes that the motion of the atoms is very slow compared to the steady state formation,
and thus the steady state formation dominates [8]. This leads to a picture where oﬀ-resonant excitation is important.
One can express the local excitation in a two-state model in the steady state regime as [24]

σee =

Ω2
∆(R)2 + 2Ω2 + (γ/2)2 ,

where ∆(R) is the local detuning, ¯h∆(R) = Ue(R)
weights the results with Eq. (42) and integrates over the position coordinate R.

−

Ug(R) + ¯h∆. As a ﬁnal stage in the local equilibrium model one

In the dynamical models it is assumed that as the system approaches RC the motion and thus the change in the
local detuning become fast compared to the steady state formation, and thus the excitation becomes a dynamical
process which is localized to a region near RC . The dynamical excitation can then be described with the Landau-Zener
curve crossing model [10–13]. In steady state models for large detunings the integration over the linewidth function
(42) becomes like a δ function which singles out the Condon point, and thus the two viewpoints agree in this limit.
The MCWP simulations have so far supported the dynamical picture over the local equilibrium picture; for further
discussion see Ref. [3].

In the weak ﬁeld limit we can assume that the excitation and subsequent decay are uncoupled, and reexcitation is

negligible. Then we can write, using the Landau-Zener model, the expression for the ﬂux on channel e as

In other words, PLZ is the one-way Landau-Zener probability of undergoing a transition from channel g to channel
e at the Condon point RC (∆), and Se(R, RC ; E, γ) is the survival probability from RC to R. We can calculate the
survival probability by assuming a classical trajectory combined with exponential (Weisskopf-Wigner) decay:

where ve(R) is the classical trajectory velocity for the excited state (in the diabatic formulation). This is the Landau-
Zener model with decay (LZD).

The above model fails when excitation and decay do not decouple, which happens at strong ﬁelds due to reexcitation
of decayed population [11,13]. We can think of reexcitation as a process which delays the start of the exponential
decay. Reexcitation takes place mainly within some region around the Condon point. We can deﬁne an interaction
region for which ∆(R) < Ω. By making the simple assumption that exponential decay can take place only outside
this region, we can rewrite the tcl in Eq. (46) as

where RΩ is deﬁned by the relation ∆(RΩ) = Ω; RΩ < RC . The modiﬁed survival term depends now on the laser
Ω2). We call this approach the Landau-Zener model with delayed decay (LZDD). Obviously the
intensity I (I
model can only give qualitative predictions, especially as the concept of the edge of the interaction region is not
well deﬁned. However, it gives a good intuitive undestanding why Je(R) for small R keeps increasing even when the
excitation saturates to unity (and thus the LZD prediction saturates) [18]. This picture agrees qualitatively with the
results from the OBE and MCWP calculations, as will be shown in the next section.

VII. COMPARISON OF METHODS

Typically the excited state ﬂux Je(R) shows oscillations at R < RC in the bare state picture. This is demonstrated
by the MCWP results given in Fig. 3. The oscillations are due to the coherences between the two states, established
near the Condon point. As the coupling Ω increases, the situation becomes increasingly adiabatic and the oscillations
disappear. At the same time the asymptotic (large R) ﬂux approaches the steady state result, 1/2. It is interesting
to note that although the main change in the ﬂux seems to take place over a wide region in R, the dynamical view
with excitation localized to RC works well, as demonstrated by us earlier in Ref. [12].

In Fig. 4 we show a comparison between the MCWP results, the diabatic OBE results (D-OBE) and adiabatic
OBE results (A-OBE). The agreement between the MCWP and A-OBE results is very satisfactory, whereas the
D-OBE results fail by an order of magnitude for T = 0.3 mK. This failure increases further as T decreases, as
shown in Refs. [10,12]. As discussed in the previous paragraph, the diﬀerence between D-OBE and A-OBE results
suggest strongly that the basic condition for the validity of the local equilibrium model is not fulﬁlled for typical trap
parameters.

We compare the complex potential method and the Landau-Zener approaches to the MCWP results in Fig. 5. The
LZD method saturates when the Landau-Zener excitation probability PLZ becomes unity; until then all methods seem
to agree well. However, beyond the saturation of the excitation the complex potential approach fails utterly. One
should note that the saturation of the dynamical excitation is not the same as the saturation of the atomic excitation
(also, the atomic excitation saturates to 1/2, but the dynamical excitation to unity). The complex potential method
fails utterly when one approaches the saturation limit. The LZDD method agrees well with the MCWP results.

We have used the A-OBE and LZDD method to calculate the ﬂux for various detunings, and the results are given
in Figs. 6 and 7. As can be expected, the saturation moves to larger Ω when ∆ increases. In Fig. 6(a) we start to see
the signs of the failure of the Landau-Zener model at small T (and small ∆).

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have derived the adiabatic optical Bloch equations. When applied to the standard two-state model
for loss of laser-cooled atoms from electromagnetic traps, these equations prove to be a fast and adequately accurate
method to predict probabilities to reach any internuclear distance on the excited quasimolecule state. The A-OBE
results match very well with the MCWP results, and also agree with the results from the qualitative LZDD model.
The latter agreement is surprisingly good, but this can be attributed to a fortuitous deﬁnition of the edge of the
interaction region.

Although the A-OBE method is a useful tool, we are still far from having a proper general treatment of trap
loss at small detunings. Firstly, the bound state structure of the attractive excited state is not taken into account.
At small detunings the vibrational states associated with the attractive molecular potential overlap strongly and at
strong ﬁelds they are also power broadened. In the language of time-dependent approach, the ﬁrst “vibration” of
the quasimolecule dominates over all the others. We can remedy the situation to some extent by applying the single
passage result to multiple passages, as has been done e.g. in Ref. [26].

Secondly, the A-OBE method does not allow for momentum change; the motion on the ground state is given by
the ground state velocity factor. When the excited state population of the quasimolecule decays back to the ground
state, its kinetic energy distribution has been aﬀected by the acceleration on the excited state. If this population is
excited by e.g. another laser, this excitation depends on the new kinetic energy distribution. This eﬀect is important
in the cases of radiative heating [11] and the radiative enhancement [27,28]. Currently only the MCWP method can
handle the kinetic energy changes correctly [11].

Thirdly, the velocity factors diverge at classical turning points. Thus the A-OBE method is not capable of treating
the case of optical shielding [3,13], which involves excitation to a repulsive quasimolecule potential by a blue-detuned

laser. This problem might be solved by replacing the WKB wave function by a proper Airy function solution in our
derivation of the A-OBE method [29].

Finally, we have given here as an example only the case of one ground state and one excited state. In reality we
have several states involved in the cold collision process, e.g., the various partial waves and hyperﬁne states. In such a
situation it is not so easy to write out the transformation to the adiabatic representation in an analytic form. However,
there are various methods for doing the change of basis numerically. A problem may arise from the fact that we had
to redeﬁne the velocity factors using physical arguments—it is not obvious if such a redeﬁnition in a multistate case
would be as straightforward and clear as in the two-state case. In any case, the A-OBE method should be capable of
handling adequately the case of several partly overlapping strong crossings in a system of close-lying states. In such a
situation the Landau-Zener methods are expected to fail—the A-OBE method can help in testing the validity of the
Landau-Zener methods in nontrivial crossing situations.

For small detunings the Condon point moves to very large distances and the quasimolecule potential does not
have the simple 1/R3 dependence any more. Furthermore, the retardation eﬀects become important, and then the
quasimolecular line widths become R dependent even in the diabatic representation. The A-OBE method should be
very useful in studying these situations, as it is much faster than the MCWP method when exploring a wide range of
cases with varying laser parameters (∆ and Ω) and quasimolecule potentials (C3, l).

Despite some limitations the A-OBE method is a clear leap forward in treating theoretically the cold collisions in
light ﬁelds. The discussion above, however, should be taken as a warning against trusting the method too blindly.
The results given in this paper and in our previous report [18] indicate nevertheless that the method is very good in
predicting the behaviour of trap loss due to near-resonant light.

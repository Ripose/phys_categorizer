Nonlinear magneto-optical (NMO) resonances occurring for near-zero magnetic ﬁeld are studied
in Rb vapor using light-noise spectroscopy. With a balanced detection polarimeter, we observe
high contrast variations of the noise power (at ﬁxed analysis frequency) carried by diode laser light
resonant with the 5S1/2 (F = 2) → 5P1/2 (F = 1) transition of 87Rb and transmitted through a
rubidium vapor cell, as a function of magnetic ﬁeld B. A symmetric resonance doublet of anti-
correlated noise is observed for orthogonal polarizations around B = 0 as a manifestation of ground
state coherence. We also observe sideband noise resonances when the magnetic ﬁeld produces an
atomic Larmor precession at a frequency corresponding to one half of the analysis frequency. The
resonances on the light ﬂuctuations are the consequence of phase to amplitude noise conversion
owing to nonlinear coherence eﬀects in the response of the atomic medium to the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld.
A theoretical model (derived from linearized Bloch equations) is presented that reproduces the main
qualitative features of the experimental signals under simple assumptions.

INTRODUCTION.

A. Noise spectroscopy.

Light waves such as laser beams possess unavoidable
ﬂuctuations either in amplitude,
frequency or phase.
Such ﬂuctuations may arise from the speciﬁc dynamics
of the light source and are, in any case, submitted to
the constraints imposed by the quantum nature of light.
The light ﬁeld ﬂuctuations determine its spectrum.
In
most cases, the ﬂuctuations in the light wave play a sig-
niﬁcant role in the interaction with matter. A trivial
example is the broadening of spectral features as a result
of the ﬁnite spectral width of the light. The study of
the detailed inﬂuence of light ﬂuctuations in the light-
atom interaction has motivated a large amount of re-
search [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In some cases,
the light ﬂuctuations are modelled as classical stochastic
processes [1], in other cases a fully quantum approach is
required [3, 4]. It has been demonstrated that several fea-
tures of the atomic response are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
the light ﬂuctuations. In turn, the interaction with the
atomic system may result in interesting modiﬁcations of
the light ﬁeld statistics giving rise to such eﬀects as anti-
bunching, squeezing, etc. [12].

A renewal of interest in the study of light ﬂuctuations
in matter-wave interactions occurred after Yabusaki et
al. [13] demonstrated that the study of ﬂuctuations of
the light transmitted through an atomic sample can be
used as a spectroscopic tool [14, 15, 16, 17]. Indeed, the
spectral analysis of the photocurrent produced in a detec-
tor by the light transmitted through the sample reveals
spectral features that are associated to the atomic dy-
namics. In the experiment of [13] a diode laser was used.
Diode laser light is known to possess (under rather ordi-
nary conditions) small amplitude ﬂuctuations and large

phase ﬂuctuations [18]. If the laser beam is directly sent
on a detector (such as a photodiode) which is sensitive
only to light intensity, a low level of ﬂuctuations is ob-
served (essentially shot-noise). On the other hand, if the
light beam reaches the detector after traversing a reso-
nant atomic medium a substantial increase in the ﬂuc-
tuation level is observed. One can say that the atomic
medium is responsible for transforming the phase noise
(present in the incident ﬁeld) into amplitude noise that
can be observed with the photodetector [15, 17].

The simplest way for achieving the transformation
from phase noise into intensity noise is to produce in-
terference of the ﬁeld with a second (reference) ﬁeld of
same frequency (homodyning) which is out of phase. Let
the ﬁrst ﬁeld be α (t) = [¯α + δα (t)] eiωt + cc where ¯α
is a real constant amplitude and the ﬂuctuation term
δα (t) = ib (t) is purely imaginary (phase noise). Let
β (t) = [A + iB] eiωt + cc be the reference ﬁeld with com-
plex amplitude and negligible ﬂuctuations. Then the
ﬂuctuation in the total ﬁeld intensity is given by:

δI (t) = 2Bb (t) ,

(1)

indicating that the intensity noise is proportional to the
incident ﬁeld phase noise and the quadrature component
of the reference ﬁeld.

For optically thin atomic samples, one can describe [15]

the transmitted ﬁeld ET as:

ET (t) = [α (t) + iβ (t)] eiωt ,

(2)

where α (t) is the incident ﬁeld and β (t) is a ﬁeld ra-
diated by the atoms that is proportional to the atomic
electric dipole. Consequently, the ﬁeld generated by the
atoms plays the role of the reference ﬁeld in the homo-
dyne detection. From Eqs. 1 and 2 we see that the phase
ﬂuctuations present in the incident ﬁeld will be trans-
formed into light intensity ﬂuctuations by the real part

of the atomic dipole which is directly linked to the disper-
sive properties of the medium. It is clear from this anal-
ysis that the observation of the transmitted ﬁeld noise,
as a function of diﬀerent parameters, provides an useful
handle to study the inﬂuence of such parameters on the
atomic dispersion. In the preceding discussion we have
neglected ﬂuctuations in the atomic dipole responding
to the ﬂuctuations in the incident ﬁeld. If such atomic
ﬂuctuations are included in the analysis they result in an
additional contribution to the transmitted ﬁeld noise car-
rying information on the atomic dynamics. In particular,
one should expect a resonant behavior of the transmit-
ted noise whenever a spectral component of the incident
ﬁeld ﬂuctuation corresponds to a characteristic frequency
of the atom-ﬁeld evolution.

B. Nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects.

When a light ﬁeld resonantly interacts with an atomic
transition between two levels with angular momentum
degeneracy, the diﬀerent polarization components of the
incident ﬁeld couple to diﬀerent transitions between Zee-
man sublevels. As a result, the absorption and disper-
sion experienced by the diﬀerent polarization compo-
nents may be diﬀerent, giving rise to such eﬀects as bire-
fringence and dichroism which result in changes in the po-
larization (as well as amplitude and phase) of the trans-
mitted light. These eﬀects depend on the speciﬁc atomic
Zeeman sublevel energies and are consequently very sen-
sitive to the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. Such
magneto-optical eﬀects have been recently reviewed by
Budker et al. [19]. In this comprehensive review a dis-
tinction is established between linear magneto-optical ef-
fects (depending linearly on the light ﬁeld intensity) and
nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects (NMOE) involving the
quadratic or higher order dependence on light intensity.
While linear magneto-optics is a quite old branch of op-
tical physics, NMOE has attracted considerable atten-
tion in recent years. Such attention was motivated by
the discovery in experiments on atomic transitions with
a long-lived lower state, of a very large enhancement in
the magneto-optical response of the atomic sample when
the optical ﬁeld veriﬁes the condition for a two-photon
(Raman) resonance between ground state Zeeman sub-
In the case of a single optical ﬁeld interacting
levels.
with the atoms, the Raman resonance condition for two
orthogonal polarization components occurs at zero mag-
netic ﬁeld. The enhanced magneto-optical response is
nonlinear in the light intensity and is due to the coher-
ence induced by the ﬁeld between ground state Zeeman
sublevels. A typical example of such NMOE is the non-
linear Faraday eﬀect resulting in a steep variation of the
optical ﬁeld polarization angle when a longitudinal mag-
netic ﬁeld is tuned across B = 0. A distinctive feature
of such NMOE is its narrow width, which corresponds,
in terms of magnetic ﬁeld, to gµBB ∼ ~γ, where γ is
the relaxation rate acting upon the ground state Zeeman

2

coherence, g is the Land´e factor and µB the Bohr magne-
ton. Since ground state dephasing collisions are usually
negligible in actual experimental conditions involving al-
kali atoms, γ is essentially determined by the interaction
time between light and atom. Several techniques can be
used to obtain long (eﬀective) interaction times such as
Ramsey zones, paraﬃn coated cells or vapor cells with
buﬀer gas. NMOE resonances as narrow as 2π × 1 Hz
have been observed [20]. The nonlinear Faraday eﬀect is
intimately related to other NMOE such as ground state
Hanle eﬀect, Hanle/CPT resonances, self rotation, align-
ment to orientation conversion, slow group velocity, etc.
that are the consequence of the coherence created in the
atomic ground state [19].

The experimental observation of NMOE imposes some
demanding experimental conditions. A careful shielding
and control of the magnetic ﬁeld is necessary. Also, in
order to detect the small NMOE from background noise
and systematic deviations, some kind of modulation tech-
nique is normally required. The nonlinear Faraday eﬀect
has been investigated using high precision polarimetry
in which the incident ﬁeld polarization was modulated
by a Faraday rotator [20, 21].
In the balanced detec-
tion scheme, the light transmitted through the sample
is separated into two branches with orthogonal polariza-
tions and balanced intensities. As the magnetic ﬁeld is
scanned, the diﬀerence between the intensities of the two
branches is monitored. A lock-in ampliﬁer extracts the
signal at the ﬁrst or second harmonic of the modulation
frequency. Recently, frequency modulation of light was
used for the detection of nonlinear magneto-optical rota-
tion [22]. In such a case, in addition to the usual non-
linear magneto-optical (NMO) resonance occurring for
B ≃ 0, symmetric sidebands occur when the magnetic
ﬁeld gives rise to a Larmor precession frequency equal
to a multiple of the FM frequency (that can be easily
achieved in the MHz range). These sidebands whose in-
trinsic width is, as for the central feature, determined
by γ allow the extension of NMOE based magnetome-
try to ﬁelds of the order of one Gauss. Recently, narrow
NMOE resonances have been observed in Rb vapor in
the presence of Ne buﬀer gas [23] using a parametric res-
onance technique [24]. In this case the magnetic ﬁeld is
modulated. As for the FM NMOE spectroscopy, sharp
sidebands are observed when the modulation frequency
equals twice the atomic Larmor precession in the mag-
netic ﬁeld.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that noise
spectroscopy can be used as a convenient sensitive tool
for the observation of nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects.
The method consists of taking advantage of the intrinsic
phase modulation of the light ﬁeld produced by its ran-
dom ﬂuctuations. FM and noise spectroscopy are closely
related techniques as noticed in [14, 16]. In both cases the
atomic medium introduces an imbalance between sym-
metric spectral ﬁeld components resulting in an intensity
modulation of the light.

transient precession (triggered by spontaneous emission
events) of oriented atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld was recently
reported [25]. In addition, the connection between light
ﬂuctuation statistics and NMOE has come into focus af-
ter the proposal [26] and the recent experimental obser-
vation [27, 28] of vacuum squeezing via self rotation.

A close connection exists between NMOE and other co-
herence phenomena such as electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT). EIT is frequently realized in three
level Λ systems where the two lower levels are Zeeman
sublevels of the same degenerate atomic level and the
ﬁelds acting on the two arms of the Λ system are the two
circular components of a linearly polarized optical wave
[29, 30]. Notice that, in this case, a perfect (classical)
correlation exists between the ﬂuctuations on two ﬁelds
participating in the EIT. The resonance between the
ﬁelds and the atomic levels is controlled by a longitudi-
nal magnetic ﬁeld. From this point of view, the zero-ﬁeld
NMO resonance correspond to the Raman resonance con-
dition and thus to the occurrence of EIT owing to coher-
ent population trapping (CPT) in the ground state. Due
to its potential application to quantum optical informa-
tion processing [31], there is currently a large interest in
the statistical properties of
light ﬁelds participating in
EIT resonances [32]. From this perspective, the follow-
ing study of the noise properties of the transmitted light
by an atomic sample in the vicinity of a NMO resonance
also concerns the statistical properties of two perfectly
correlated classical ﬁelds undergoing an EIT resonance.

por cell (at room temperature). The total light power
available at the cell was 3 mW (0.5 cm2 beam cross sec-
tion). The cell was placed inside a three-layer mu-metal
magnetic shield surrounding a solenoid that allows the
scanning of a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. After the cell,
the light polarization was analyzed with a balanced po-
larimeter consisting of a waveplate and a polarizing beam
splitter cube. Two diﬀerent polarization decompositions
of the light were used. When a λ/4 waveplate was present
between the cell and the beam splitter the light was sep-
arated into the two orthogonal circular components (σ+
and σ−). If, instead, a λ/2 waveplate was used, the light
was decomposed into two linear and orthogonal polariza-
tions at ±45◦ with respect to the incident ﬁeld polariza-
tion. The light intensities along the two output branches
of the polarimeter were detected by similar (balanced)
photodiodes with 10 MHz bandwidth. The two photocur-
rents were added or subtracted before being sent to an
electronic spectrum analyzer with 1.8 GHz bandwidth.
The spectrum analyzer was used in the zero span mode
thus operating as a band-pass ﬁlter. A 2.5 MHz analysis
frequency was used since this frequency happened to be
well separated from spurious ambient noise. The noise
power was recorded as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld
at the cell. The experiments were carried with an ex-
tended cavity diode laser whose ﬂuctuations are reduced
and spectrally narrower if compared with free running
lasers. This choice was due to practical considerations
related to the improved frequency stability and tunabil-
ity of extended cavity diode lasers. We have carried some
preliminary tests indicating that the use of a free running
laser is possible and opens the way for the choice of larger
analysis frequencies.

FIG. 3: Central structure of the noise power signal at 2.5 MHz
for circular polarizations as a function of magnetic ﬁeld for
various light intensities. The relative light power is indicated.

The recorded signals corresponding to the noise power
on the sum and diﬀerence of the two photocurrents, for
two diﬀerent choices of the polarization components of
the polarimeter, are presented in Fig. 2. The noise power
is presented relative to the shot-noise level measured on
the photocurrent diﬀerence when the laser frequency is
tuned away from the atomic resonance. Also shown
in Fig. 2 is the excess intensity-noise level (6.5 ± 0.1
dB above the shot-noise) existing on the oﬀ-resonance
light. Around B = 0, the noise on the photocurrent sum
presents a reduction (to a level approaching the excess-
noise level) due to the occurrence of EIT. In addition,
smaller reduction of the sum noise are observed on two
sidebands occurring when the magnetic ﬁeld induces a
Zeeman shift corresponding to one half of the analysis
frequency. The photocurrent diﬀerence noise is domi-
nant for small values of B (corresponding to the occur-
rence of the EIT resonance) and at the sidebands indi-
cating anti-correlation of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. A sharp
(100% contrast) decrease in the photocurrent diﬀerence
noise occurs for exact cancelation of the magnetic ﬁeld
where the noise drops to the shot-noise level. Rather sim-
ilar shapes in the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the pho-
tocurrent diﬀerence noise are observed for circular and
linear polarizations. In the latter case the noise power
is increased (4.1 ±0.7 dB around B = 0). The intensity
dependence of the central feature of the photocurrent dif-
ference noise for circular polarizations is shown in Fig. 3.
The doublet narrows and decreases as the light intensity
is reduced. The narrowest observed doublet corresponds
to a 70 mG separation between maxima. A similar nar-
rowing and reduction is observed on the central dip on
the photodetector sum signal noise (not shown).

III. THEORY.

We present in this section a simple theoretical analysis
of the interaction of an atomic system and a ﬂuctuating
light ﬁeld leading to the calculation of balanced detec-
tion signals. The model is intended for an electric-dipole-
allowed atomic transition between two energy levels with
arbitrary angular momentum degeneracy. The transmit-
ted ﬁeld is analyzed along arbitrary polarization compo-
nents. The calculation is a direct extension of previous
treatments [33, 34] with the inclusion of a ﬂuctuating
component on the incident ﬁeld. The ﬁeld is assumed to
present small time dependent ﬂuctuations around a con-
stant nonzero mean value. This assumption allows the
calculation of the atomic ﬂuctuations through a linear
response theory [10].

We consider two degenerate levels: a ground level g of
total angular momentum Fg and energy 0 and an excited
state e of angular momentum Fe and energy ~ω0. The
total radiative relaxation coeﬃcient of level e is Γ. We
assume that the atoms in the excited state radiatively
decay into the ground state g at the rate ηΓ, where η is
a branching ratio coeﬃcient that depends on the speciﬁc
atomic transition [0 ≤ η ≤ 1; η = 1 for a closed (cy-
cling) transition]. We consider a homogeneous ensemble
of atoms at rest. However, in order to simulate the eﬀect
of a ﬁnite interaction time of the atoms with the light,
we assume that the atoms escape the interaction region
at a rate γ (γ ≪ Γ). This escape is compensated, in
steady-state, by the arrival of fresh atoms in the ground
state.

The incident ﬁeld is E(t) = EeeiωLt + E∗e∗e−iωLt
where E is the complex amplitude and e is a unit po-
larization vector.

The atom ﬁeld coupling in the rotating wave approxi-

mation (RWA) is:

Here Qge = PgQPe where Pg and Pe are the projectors

dimensionless operator Q is related to the atomic electric
dipole operator through:

D = hgkDkei Q ,

(4)

where hgkDkei is the reduced matrix element of the
dipole operator between the ground and excited state
(considered real). 2Ω = hgkDkei E/~ is the reduced Rabi
frequency of the ﬁeld.

The total Hamiltonian in the RWA is: H = H0 + W
where H0 = ~ω0Pe + (βgPg + βePe)FzB is the atomic
Hamiltonian including the Zeeman coupling with the
magnetic ﬁeld B (βg and βe are the ground and excited
sate gyromagnetic factors and Fz is the total angular mo-
mentum projection along the magnetic ﬁeld).

where κ is a constant dependent on the optical thickness

atoms respectively. We write:

In general, the atomic dipole ﬂuctuations are not neg-

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS.

We present in this section the transmitted ﬁeld noise
spectra calculated from the model above. Having the
comparison with experimental results in mind, we restrict
ourselves to a limited choice of the parameters within the
large freedom allowed by the model. We consider a model
atomic transition Fg = 1 → Fe = 0. The transition is
considered closed in the sense that the radiative decay
from the excited state returns the atom to the ground
level (η = 1 in the model). However, the transition actu-
ally behaves as an open transition due to the existence of
a trapping state in the ground level [35]. Numerical simu-
lations with more realistic choices of the atomic level an-
gular momenta and branching ratio are straightforward
and give results qualitatively similar to those presented
here.

The ﬁeld incident on the atomic sample is taken lin-
early polarized and we consider the decomposition of the
transmitted light either into two orthogonal circular po-
larization components or two orthogonal linear polariza-
tion components.

A strong simpliﬁcation is introduced based on the fact
that phase noise is known to be dominant in diode lasers
[18]. We consider that all the incident ﬁeld noise is in

the quadrature component b (t) [we take a (t) = 0]. Such
assumption leads to a qualitative agreement with the ex-
perimental observation. If amplitude noise is introduced
in the calculation, it generally results in a dominant noise
background since in this case there are intensity ﬂuctua-
tions at the detectors even in the absence of the atomic
medium.

We calculate noise power at a ﬁxed analysis frequency
ω as a function of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld B. This
calculation does not require the knowledge of the inci-
dent ﬁeld spectrum. According to Eq. 15, only the value

(a scale factor) is needed. In all the calcula-

b (ω)(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)e
tions presented below we have used ω = 0.3Γ (∼ 2 MHz
(cid:12)
in the case of the Rb D lines). The evaluations of βq,
and
δβq (ω) require the knowledge of the proportionality
constant K (see Eqs. A13, A18). We have taken K = 1
f
which (together with γ = 10−3Γ) results in ∼20% weak
ﬁeld linear absorption (a rather realistic ﬁgure in view of
the experiments).

The calculated value for the noise power spectrum,
Sqq (ω), for one circular polarization component is pre-
sented as a function of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
in Fig. 4 (in terms of the corresponding Zeeman energy
shift: ∆EZ = gµBB). In this plot, the atom ﬁeld detun-
ing δ = ω0 − ωL is taken as zero. The noise spectrum is
mainly composed of two broad peaks symmetric around
B = 0 with width and separation of the order of Γ and a
narrow structure (a doublet) of characteristic width much
smaller than Γ. The broad structure arises from a linear
magneto-optical eﬀect: the circular birefringence result-
ing in the dephasing of one circular ﬁeld component with
respect to the incident ﬁeld. As discussed above, such de-
phasing results in phase to amplitude noise conversion.

The central structure is a result of the NMOE occurring

For comparison, we show in the same ﬁgure the real part

1. Also shown in Fig. 5a is the cross-correlation spec-
trum Sqq′ (ω) for the two diﬀerent (orthogonal) circular
polarizations.
In the present case of δ = 0, we have
Sqq′ (ω) = −Sqq (ω) and consequently Z+ (ω) = 0 and
Z− (ω) = 4Sqq (ω).

In ﬁgure 5b a nonzero laser-atom detuning was used.
We have taken δ = Γ as a representative example. Notice
the asymmetry in the plot of Sqq (ω). Such asymmetry
is expected since, for zero detuning, a given circular po-
larization of the ﬁeld will get closer or farther to reso-
nance depending on the magnetic ﬁeld sign. Neverthe-
less, the cross-correlation spectrum Sqq′ (ω) remains sym-
metric with respect to B = 0. Another signiﬁcant feature
in Fig. 5b is the presence in both Sqq (ω) and Sqq′ (ω)
of sidebands occurring for values of the magnetic ﬁeld
for which the Zeeman shift ∆EZ satisﬁes 2∆EZ = ~ω
(∆EZ /Γ = 0.15 for the parameters of Fig. 5) [22]. One
can check from Fig. 5b that these sidebands are entirely

due to the

q (ω) contribution.

The plots of the calculated intensity sum and diﬀer-
ence noise signals, Z+ (ω) and Z− (ω) respectively, for
the choice of parameters of Fig. 5b in a balanced po-
larimeter in which the ﬁeld is decomposed into orthogo-
nal circular polarization components are shown in Fig. 6.
Z+ (ω), the total transmitted intensity noise, presents a
broad background level owing to linear phase to ampli-
tude noise conversion produced by the nonzero real part
of the mean atomic polarization. Along with this broad
linear contribution, Z+ (ω) presents narrow NMO struc-
tures: the central dip and the sidebands. The central dip
is easily understood by noticing that at B = 0 the con-
dition is met for coherence population trapping (CPT)
among Zeeman sublevels which result in electromagneti-
cally induced transparency (EIT). The sidebands are due
to resonances in the atomic ﬂuctuations when the anal-

ysis frequency corresponds to twice the atomic Larmor
frequency. The photocurrent diﬀerence noise Z− (ω) is
dominated by the central doublet which is related to the
nonlinear circular birefringence occurring around B = 0.
The two circular polarizations of the induced atomic
dipole are dephased in opposite directions resulting in
anti-correlated light ﬂuctuations. As a result of symme-
try, for B = 0 we have Sqq (ω) = Sq′q′ (ω) = Sqq′ (ω) =
Sq′q (ω) and consequently Z− (ω) cancels at this point.
The dependence of Z− (ω) (for orthogonal circular po-
larizations) on the light intensity is presented in Fig. 7.
Let us discuss now the case of a balanced detector po-
larimeter in which the two orthogonal output polariza-
tions q and q′ are linear. In such a case, if the laser-atom
detuning δ is zero the output light ﬂuctuations are zero on
both polarizations. This is a somehow surprising result
since the nonlinear Faraday eﬀect results in the rotation
of the mean transmitted ﬁeld polarization. However, in
this case the real part of the induced atomic polarization
along the two components q and q′ is zero (i.e. the inter-
action is purely absorptive) and thus no phase to noise
conversion occurs. The situation is diﬀerent for nonzero
δ. The curves corresponding to Sqq (ω) and Sqq′ (ω) for
δ = Γ are presented in Fig. 8. The corresponding trace
for Z− (ω) is shown in Fig. 6 (Z+ (ω) is the same than
for circular polarizations). Notice the signiﬁcant reduc-
tion of Z− (ω) in comparison with the result obtained for
circular polarizations.

V. DISCUSSION.

The traces presented in Fig. 2 provide a clear demon-
stration of the use of noise analysis for the observation
of NMOE. The observed features (much narrower than
the optical transition linewidth Γ) are the consequence

of ground state coherence. As in the usual ground state
Hanle eﬀect and other NMOE, a coherence resonance is
observed around B = 0. Additional resonances of com-
parable width are also observed when the magnetic ﬁeld
induces a precession of the ground state alignment at one
half of the analysis frequency. Such resonances may be
understood as Raman resonances between the laser car-
rier frequency and the “sidebands” produced by the light
“modulation” produced by the spectral component of the
noise at the analysis frequency.

The similarity between the experimental observations
It suggests
and the calculations (Fig. 6) is apparent.
that the essential ingredients of the NMO noise eﬀects
are contained in the simple model considered.

However, several important diﬀerences between the
model assumptions and the actual experimental condi-
tions must be mentioned. The ﬁrst concerns the fact that
the numerical calculations were made for a homogeneous
sample of atoms while the experiment is carried out on
a vapor cell where diﬀerent atoms experience diﬀerent
detunings δ, owing to the Doppler eﬀect. Numerical in-
tegration over δ is straightforward. The resulting curves
for the balanced detection signals preserve the shape of
the central feature but do not present the relatively large
weight of the sidebands observed in the experiments. Our
second comment concerns the naive description of the
laser noise. As already mentioned, the laser amplitude
noise was completely neglected.
In the context of the
model this appears to be a reasonable assumption since
even modest amounts of amplitude noise (compared to
quadrature noise) result in a magnetic-ﬁeld-independent
signal background. Moreover, diode lasers are known to
possess phase noise in excess of amplitude noise over a

8

wide bandwidth. On the other hand, this simpliﬁcation
imposes several restrictions, such as the impossibility to
model the eﬀect of shot-noise. Another important sim-
pliﬁcation in the theory above is the linearized treatment
of the ﬁeld noise as small ﬂuctuations around a constant
mean value. Such a treatment is not appropriate when
the ﬁeld phase experiences random ﬂuctuations resulting
in phase diﬀusion.
In the present experimental condi-
tions, the phase diﬀusion time of our laser is of the order
of a microsecond (inverse of the laser linewidth), which
is short compared to the temporal evolution of coherence
resonances. This suggests that the treatment of the laser
light as a phase diﬀusing ﬁeld should be more appropri-
ate. We have carried out a calculation using a phase
diﬀusing ﬁeld, to be presented elsewhere.

A striking diﬀerence between the experimental and the
theoretical curves concerns the relative amplitude of the
photocurrent diﬀerence noise for circular and linear po-
larizations. While the experimental result is that the
noise is enhanced for linear polarizations by a factor of
almost two, the calculation shows a strong noise reduc-
tion (see Fig. 6). We believe this to be a consequence of
the inadequacy of the linear model. In fact, the results of
the phase diﬀusing ﬁeld treatment present a better agree-
ment with the experimental observation in this respect.
Another important diﬀerence between theoretical and
experimental traces is the weight of the sidebands. The
large contribution to the noise occurring at the sidebands
appears to be out of reach for our present theoretical ap-
proach. This suggests that new key ingredients, such as
propagation eﬀects in optically thick media or the inﬂu-
ence of resonance ﬂuorescence scattered into the detected
light modes [27], must be considered for a more accurate
theoretical model.

VI. CONCLUSIONS.

We have shown that noise analysis provides a useful
handle for the study of NMOE. Our experiments reveal
NMO features observed with large contrast and resolu-
tion without the use of any light frequency modulation
other than noise modulation intrinsically present in any
light source. The technique presented here can be eas-
ily applied to other elements and transitions. Since laser
sources frequently present a broad noise spectrum, the
noise detection of NMOE can be used over a large dy-
namic range of analysis frequencies, allowing the obser-
vation of coherent features for relatively large values of
the magnetic ﬁeld (several Gauss). On the other hand,
application of the noise detection technique to paraﬃn
coated or buﬀer gas cells should allow the observation of
coherence resonances in the µG range. Noise detected
NMO resonances may therefore be of interest for high
precision magnetometry.

We have presented a simple and rather general theoret-
ical treatment for the calculation of the spectral proper-
ties of the noise signals available in a balanced detection

experiment. Good qualitative correspondence between
the predictions of the model and the observations was
obtained. However, some features, mainly the weight
and shapes of the sideband resonances and the observed
dependence of the noise signals on the orthogonal polar-
ization decomposition, strongly suggest that a more pre-
cise treatment of the optical ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (including
quantum ﬂuctuations) and the atomic medium may be
necessary. Additional work along this line is currently
underway.

APPENDIX A

We present in this appendix the steps leading to the
calculation of the noise spectral signals observed in a bal-
anced detection polarimeter. We initially transform the
Bloch equation Eq. 5 using a Liouville space representa-
tion. Later on, the linear response of the atomic dipole to
the incident ﬂuctuating ﬁeld is derived and the spectral
signals calculated.

1. Liouville space representation.

We consider a complex vectorial space L of dimension
given by the number of elements in ρ. To each density
matrix ρ in Hilbert space we associate a (column) vec-
tor y in L in such way that each matrix element in ρ
corresponds to an element of y.

where I is the identity operator in L and V = Vge + Veg
(see Eq. 3).

It is convenient to consider the Liouville space vector
x = exp (iN ωLt) y entirely composed by slowly varying
coeﬃcients. Substitution in Eq. A3 gives:

˙x = (iN ωL + A) x + γy0 .

(A7)

After solving A7, the slowly varying envelope of the

atomic polarization can be obtained through:

P (t) = u†L (Deg) x (t) .

(A8)

2. Fluctuating atomic response.

We seek a solution of Eq. A7 in the form x (t) =
¯x + δx (t). Linearizing Eq. A7 we have the following
system:

where B ≡ iN ωL +A and we have taken advantage of the
fact that A is linear on the complex ﬁeld amplitudes α (t)
and α∗ (t) (see Eq. A5). Eq. A9 gives the mean value
¯x from which the average atomic dipole components βq
can be obtained (using Eq. A8) as:

βq = Ku†L (q∗ · Deg) ¯x ,

where K is a proportionality constant.

Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. A10:

where L (O) and R (O) are linear operators in L.

Let u be the vector in L with all elements correspond-
ing to populations equal to one and all elements corre-
sponding to coherences equal to zero. We note for further
use that trace (Oρ) = u†L (O) y.

After some algebra, one can show that the Bloch equa-

tion Eq. 5 can be written in the form [15]:

˙y = exp (−iN ωLt) A exp (iN ωLt) y + γy0

We report on the spectroscopy of the 5s2 1S0 (F = 9/2) → 5s5p 3P0 (F = 9/2) clock transition
of 87Sr atoms (natural linewidth of 1 mHz) trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Recoilless
transitions with a linewidth of 0.7 kHz as well as the vibrational structure of the lattice potential
were observed. By investigating the wavelength dependence of the carrier linewidth, we determined
the magic wavelength, where the light shift in the clock transition vanishes, to be 813.5 ± 0.9 nm.

Precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules has
been the essential basis for quantum physics: An increase
in precision revealed newer aspects of physics, which
motivated the continuous endeavor to develop advanced
spectroscopic methods [1]. Thanks to the state-of-the-art
frequency synthesis technology [2, 3] that links optical
frequencies at 10−18 accuracy [3], a stringent compari-
son of the stability and accuracy among optical-clocks
[2] becomes feasible, which allows for a more accurate
deﬁnition of the SI second and determination of the fun-
damental constants [4], and leads to the study of time-
variation of fundamental constants [5, 6, 7]. The existing
microwave or optical clocks based on cesium atoms in a
fountain [2, 8], a single mercury ion in a Paul trap [9] or
ultracold neutral calcium atoms in free fall [10], have so
far demonstrated a fractional accuracy and stability on
the order of 10−15 [1, 2, 8, 9, 10], and vigorous eﬀorts are
being made for their further improvement.

In quest of the novel scheme for future optical stan-
dard, we have explored the feasibility of an “optical lat-
tice clock” [11, 12, 13], in which millions of neutral atoms
trapped in an engineered optical lattice serve as quan-
tum references eﬀectively free from light ﬁeld perturba-
tions [14]. In this scheme, sub-wavelength conﬁnement of
atoms provided by an optical-lattice with less than unity
occupation [15] completely eliminates both the Doppler
and collisional shifts, which are known to cause major un-
certainties in optical standards with freely falling atoms;
recent study assuming ultracold Ca atoms predicted their
contribution could approach down to 8 × 10−16 in the fu-
ture [10]. Furthermore, an extended interrogation time
of atoms trapped in the lattice potential will provide a
2 − 3 orders of magnitude higher line Q-factor than that
has been obtained for freely falling atoms [2, 10, 16].
With the line Q-factor competitive to a single trapped
ion clock [9], but with millions of atoms interrogated si-
multaneously as in the case of neutral-atom-based optical
clocks [2, 10, 16], the “optical lattice clock” is expected
to exhibit an exceptionally high stability: Its anticipated
accuracy of 10−17 [13] can be reached within only 1 sec-
ond of interrogation time.

In this Letter, we report on the ﬁrst demonstration of

the “optical lattice clock” by performing spectroscopy on
the 5s2 1S0 (F = 9/2) − 5s5p 3P0 (F = 9/2) clock tran-
sition of 87Sr atoms trapped in a 1D optical lattice. In
our primary search for the 1-mHz-narrow clock transi-
tion, a quenching technique [17] was applied to the 3P0
metastable state to artiﬁcially broaden the clock transi-
tion linewidth. We then discuss the method to adjust
the light shifts in the clock transition by monitoring the
lineshape of the carrier spectrum.

The transition frequency ν of atoms exposed to a
dipole trapping [18] laser with a slowly varying electric
ﬁeld amplitude of E is described as [13]

~ν = ~ν(0) −

∆α(e, λ)E 2 −

∆γ(e, λ)E 4 − . . . ,

(1)

where ν(0) is the transition frequency between the un-
perturbed atomic states, ∆α(e, λ) and ∆γ(e, λ) are the
diﬀerences between the ac polarizabilities and hyperpo-
larizabilities of the upper and lower states, which depend
both on the light polarization unit vector e and on the
trapping laser wavelength λ, and ~ is the Planck constant.
In order to reduce the polarization dependent light shift
[12] and other systematic shifts, we proposed to use the
1S0 − 3P0 transition of 87Sr [11] that is free from elec-
tronic angular momentum. At the “magic wavelength”
that sets the diﬀerential dipole polarizability to zero, the
residual contributions due to the polarization dependent
light shift, the hyperpolarizability, and the higher-order
multipole corrections to the polarizability, were calcu-
lated to be less than 10−17 [13] for a light ﬁeld intensity
of IL = 10 kW/cm2. In the lattice scheme, this residual
light shift poses the major limitation for the attainable
accuracy: The suppression of the Doppler and collisional
shifts by the lattice potential, therefore, will bring about
more than an order of magnitude better accuracy for neu-
tral atom clock.

The relevant energy levels are shown in Fig. 1. The
5s2 1S0 (F = 9/2) − 5s5p 3P0 (F = 9/2) transition with a
hyperﬁne induced decay rate of γ0 = 2π × 1 mHz [11, 19]
at λ0 = 698 nm is used as clock transition. By optically
coupling the 5s2 1S0 and 5s5p 3P0 state to the upper
respective spin states with a standing-wave trapping laser

ment. The excited atoms on the |1S0i ⊗ |ni → |3P0i ⊗ |ni
electronic-vibrational transitions in the light shift potentials
were quenched into the 3P2 metastable state via the rapidly
decaying 3S1 state. The clock transition was sensitively mon-
itored on the 1S0 − 1P1 transition.

FIG. 2: An external cavity laser diode (ECLD) was elec-
tronically stabilized to a high-ﬁnesse reference cavity made
of ultra-low-expansion (ULE) glass. This clock laser at λ0 =
698 nm was superimposed on the Ti-Sapphire laser (used for
trapping atoms) and coupled into a polarization-maintaining
single-mode ﬁber. The radiation from the ﬁber was focused
onto the ultracold atom cloud and the trapping beam alone
was retro-reﬂected to form an optical lattice, where ez de-
notes the unit vector parallel to the clock and the trap laser
axes.

tuned to the “magic wavelength”, lattice potentials [15]
with equal depth are produced for the electronic states
of the clock transition [13], which tightly conﬁne atoms
to the sub-wavelength region, the so-called Lamb-Dicke
regime [20]. This conﬁguration enables recoil-free as well
as Doppler-free spectroscopy, as has been demonstrated
on the 1S0 − 3P1 transition of 88Sr atoms [12].

Figure 2 depicts the experimental setup. In order to
probe the clock transition, an external cavity laser diode
(ECLD) was electronically stabilized to a high-ﬁnesse ref-

2

erence cavity made of ultra low expansion (ULE) glass us-
ing an FM sideband technique [21, 22]. The output of the
stabilized laser was frequency-tuned by an acousto-optic
modulator (AOM) and spectrally ﬁltered by a grating to
remove the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE) from
the ECLD, as it may excite Sr transitions in the spec-
tral range of 679 − 707 nm that share the same electronic
states used for the clock transition. This clock laser was
then superimposed onto the trapping laser (Ti-Sapphire
laser, Coherent 899) and coupled into a polarization-
maintaining single-mode ﬁber.

Ultracold 87Sr atoms were produced as described pre-
viously [23]. The atoms were precooled on the 1S0 − 1P1
transition at λ = 461 nm. During the precooling process,
the atoms that leaked into the 5s5p 3P2 metastable state
via the 5s4d 1D2 state were recycled to the 1S0 ground
state via the 5s5p 3P1 state by exciting the 5s5p 3P2 →
5s6s 3S1 and the 5s5p 3P0 → 5s6s 3S1 transition [23]. In
about 300 ms the number of the precooled atoms reached
90 % of its steady state population. After turning oﬀ
the precooling and the pumping lasers, we started the
narrowline cooling on the 1S0 − 3P1 transition by em-
ploying the DMOT scheme [23]. We ﬁrst frequency-
modulated trapping and molasses lasers for 70 ms to in-
crease the velocity capture range, then turned oﬀ the
modulation and reduced the laser intensity to optimize
the atom loading into an optical lattice. The optical lat-
tice formed by the standing wave of linearly polarized
light at λL ∼ 800 nm was kept on during the experimen-
tal sequence. The lattice laser with the 1/e beam waist
of w0 = 16 µm was focused onto the ultracold atom cloud
of the narrowline MOT to load roughly 105 atoms into
this far-oﬀ-resonant lattice (FORL) in 70 ms. This lat-
tice potential typically provides a harmonic oscillation
frequency of Ω/2π ≈ 70 kHz in the axial direction ez
(see Fig. 2) as measured from the ﬁrst sideband spec-
trum, corresponding to the eﬀective peak laser intensity
of IL ≈ 30 kW/cm2.

In search for the 1 mHz narrow 1S0 − 3P0 transition
[24], we saturation-broadened the clock transition: By
guiding the clock and trap laser in the same optical ﬁber
as shown in Fig. 2, we tightly focused the clock laser ex-
actly at the trapped atom cloud in the lattice. We thus
achieved a peak power density of Ip = 120 W/cm2 by fo-
cusing 1 mW of laser power onto a trapping beam radius
of approx. w0. With this intensity a saturation broaden-
ing of γ0p1 + Ip/I0 ≈ 2π × 18 kHz was obtained, where
I0 = 0.4 pW/cm2 is the saturation intensity of the hyper-
ﬁne induced 1S0 (F = 9/2) − 3P0 (F = 9/2) transition.
By guiding both lasers in the same ﬁber, the wavevec-
tor of the clock laser with |k0| = 2π/λ0 was intrinsically
aligned parallel to the fast axis (k ez) of the lattice po-
tential, which gave the Lamb-Dicke parameter for this
axis η = |k0|p~/2mΩ ≈ 0.26, with m the mass of the
87Sr atom. We facilitated the ﬁrst search for the narrow
transition by frequency modulating the clock laser with

Clock laser detuning (kHz)

FIG. 3: The ground state population as a function of the clock
laser detuning measured at lattice laser wavelength λL =
815 nm. The upper and the lower sidebands at ≈ ±64 kHz
correspond to the heating and the cooling sidebands, respec-
tively. The base line ﬂuctuation of ≈ 15% is due to the shot-
to-shot ﬂuctuation of atoms loaded into the optical lattice.
The inset shows the recoilless spectrum (the carrier com-
ponent) with a linewidth of 0.7 kHz (FWHM) measured at
λL = 813 nm.

a spectrum spread of tens of MHz. In addition, by opti-
cally coupling the 3P0 state to the rapidly decaying 3S1
state with λ = 679 nm laser radiation, we quenched the
3P0 state lifetime and simultaneously transferred the pop-
ulation into the long-lived 3P2 metastable state [25, 26]
via the 3S1 state where the branching ratio for the decay
to the 3P2 state is 5/9. We typically irradiated both the
clock and quenching lasers for 100 ms on trapped atoms.
We then excited the dipole allowed 1S0 − 1P1 transition at
461 nm with a linewidth of γ = 2π × 32 MHz (Fig. 1) for
1 ms to observe ﬂuorescence photons proportional to the
number of atoms remaining unexcited in the 1S0 ground
state. This shelving technique [27] allowed the observa-
tion of the clock transition with unit quantum eﬃciency.
We note that Courillot et al. [24] recently reported the
1S0 − 3P0 transition frequency by observing 1.4-MHz-wide
Doppler proﬁle with 1 % excitation, in which they ﬁrst
looked for the clock transition by cascading three allowed
transitions.

After the ﬁrst detection of the clock transition with
a linewidth of tens of MHz, we gradually decreased the
intensities of the clock and the quenching lasers to ob-
serve a narrower resonance line. In order to completely
remove the light shift and broadening due to the quench-
ing laser, we alternately chopped the clock and quench-
ing lasers: After irradiating the clock laser for 5 ms, we
applied the quenching laser. We repeated this sequence
several times to increase the depletion of the 1S0 state
by exciting the clock transition. Figure 3 shows the 1S0
state population as a function of the clock laser detun-
ing. Each data point was measured in a single cycle with
roughly 105 atoms in the lattice, which required half
a second in total for cooling, capturing, and detecting

3

atoms. Thanks to the quenching laser that transferred
the atom population into the 3P2 metastable state, nearly
100 % excitation of the ground state population was ob-
served for the carrier component. The upper and the
lower sideband at ±Ω/2π ≈ ±64 kHz corresponds to the
|1S0i ⊗ |ni → |3P0i ⊗ |n ± 1i transitions, where Ω and
|ni denotes the oscillation frequency and the vibrational
state of atoms in the lattice potential. The asymmetry
in the heating and cooling sidebands [17] inferred a mean
vibrational state occupation of hni ≈ 0.5 or an atom tem-
perature of T = 2.8 µK. The narrowest linewidth of 0.7
kHz, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3, was observed at
λL = 813 nm by reducing the clock laser intensity down
to Ip = 0.1 W/cm2, where the saturation broadening of
0.5 kHz was comparable to a clock laser frequency jitter
of ≈ 0.5 kHz.

In this clock transition, the ﬁrst-order Zeeman shift
of 106 × mF Hz/G for the ∆mF = 0 transition appears
due to the hyperﬁne mixing in the 3P0 state [19, 28].
In addition, a polarization dependent light shift, which
is approximately 1 Hz/(kW/cm2) for the mF = ±9/2
states and becomes smaller as |mF | decreases, is present
[13]. Assuming a stray magnetic ﬁeld of B < 10 mG
and a lattice laser intensity of IL ≈ 30 kW/cm2, both
contributions are less than 40 Hz. At the moment, there-
fore, the carrier linewidth is mainly determined by a fre-
quency jitter of the clock laser and a saturation broad-
ening. Since we are employing a 1D optical lattice that
contained about tens of atoms per a lattice site, colli-
sional frequency shifts might be present, which would ul-
timately be eliminated by using a 3D optical lattice [15]
with less than unity occupation [11, 13].

In order to determine the “magic wavelength” for the
lattice laser, we measured the wavelength (λL) dependent
carrier lineshape, since the mismatch of the conﬁning po-
tentials introduces an additional carrier linewidth broad-
ening as discussed in the following. The energy shift of
atoms in the n-th vibrational state of the i = e (excited)
or g (ground) electronic state of the clock transition is
written as

~δi(n, λL) = ui (λL) + (n +

)~Ωi(λL),

(2)

2

where ui(λL) < 0 is the light shift at the anti-node of
the standing wave and Ωi(λL)/2π ≈ p−2ui/m/λL is
the vibrational frequency of atoms in the fast axis of
the lattice. Taking νn the transition frequency for the
|1S0i⊗|ni → |3P0i⊗|ni vibrational transition (see Fig. 1),
Eq. (2) infers that the transition frequency diﬀerence be-
tween adjacent vibrational transitions is given by the vi-
brational frequency diﬀerence δΩ ≡ Ωe − Ωg of the lat-
tice potentials in the excited and the ground state, i.e.,
νn+1 − νn = δΩ. At a ﬁnite temperature T , the oc-
cupation probability pn of the atoms in the n-th vibra-
tional state obeys the Boltzmann distribution law, i.e.,
pn+1/pn = exp(−~Ωg/kBT ) ≡ fB. Therefore, the carrier

Lattice laser wavelength (nm)

FIG. 4: The inset shows the carrier spectrum (open circles)
for the |1S0i ⊗ |ni → |3P0i ⊗ |ni transition measured at lattice
laser wavelength λL = 820 nm. This lineshape is ﬁtted by
4 Lorentian corresponding to n = 0, 1, 2, 3 vibrational tran-
sitions to deduce the Boltzmann factor fB ≈ 0.5 and the
diﬀerential vibrational frequency δΩ/2π ≈ 0.8 kHz. The lat-
ter is plotted as a function of lattice wavelength to determine
the degenerate wavelength (δΩ = 0) to be λL = 813.5 ± 0.9
nm.

spectrum for non-degenerate light shift trap (Ωe 6= Ωg)
consists of several Lorentzian excitation proﬁles with fre-
quency oﬀset given by δΩ and their peak height weighted
by the Boltzmann factor fB.

The inset of Fig. 4 demonstrates the linewidth broad-
ening of the carrier spectrum at the lattice laser wave-
length λL = 820 nm: The proﬁle was ﬁtted by 4
Lorentzians corresponding to n = 0, 1, 2, 3 vibrational
states to determine the diﬀerential vibrational frequency
δΩ/2π = 0.8 kHz and the Boltzmann factor fB ≈ 0.5. By
applying this ﬁtting procedure for carrier lineshapes mea-
sured at diﬀerent lattice laser wavelength, we deduced
the vibrational frequency mismatch δΩ/2π as shown by
ﬁlled circles in Fig. 4. These data points were then in-
terpolated by quadratic polynomial, which approximated
the wavelength dependence of the frequency mismatch to
ﬁnd the degenerate wavelength to be λL = 813.5 ± 0.9
nm. This is also conﬁrmed by measuring the linewidth
reduction of the clock transition around the wavelength.
This degenerate wavelength agreed to the previous theo-
retical calculation [13] within 2 %, in which the discrep-
ancy may be attributed to the truncation in summing up
the light shift contributions and to the limited accuracy
of the available transition strengths.

In summary, we have demonstrated for the ﬁrst time
the Doppler-free spectroscopy on the 1S0 − 3P0 transition
of 87Sr atoms trapped in a 1D Stark-free optical lattice
and determined the magic wavelength. This demonstra-
tion is an important step for the realization of the “opti-
cal lattice clock” [11, 13] that would provide a signiﬁcant
improvement in the stability over existing optical clocks.

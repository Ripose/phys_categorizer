Variational methods, multiprecision and nonrelativistic energies

It is known that the variational methods are the most powerful tool for studying the Coulomb
three–body bound state problem. However, they often suﬀer from loss of stability when the number
of basis functions increases. This problem can be cured by applying the multiprecision package
designed by D.H. Bailey. We consider the variational basis functions of the type exp(−αnr1 −βnr2 −
γnr12) with complex exponents. The method yields the best available energies for the ground states
of the helium atom and the positive hydrogen ion as well as many other known atomic and molecular
systems.

1. The development of the variational method for the
Coulomb bound state problem can be traced using as an
example the ground state of the helium atom. In early
days when computers were big and very expensive the
search proceeded mainly in the direction of making ex-
pansion of the variational wave function as compact as
possible (in a sense of number of variational parameters
and/or basis sets). At ﬁrst, the explicitly correlated basis
were introduced [1,2] now called as the Hylleraas basis

then it became clear that at least for the ground state
of the helium atom it is essential to incorporate into
the wave function such peculiarity as the logarithmic be-
haviour of the type R ln R at R = (r2

Fock [3]. In 1966, Frankowski and Pekeris (see Table II)
introduced the compact representation [4] of the form

and later, in 1984, Freund and co-workers [5] reported
even more compact expansion of the same form. Inclu-
sion of the logarithmic term into the variational wave
function brought substantial improvement of nonrela-

tivistic energies for the two electron atoms.
Thakkar and Koga [6] have found a compact expansion
without logarithms which uses powers that are not inte-
gers nor even half integers. As far as we know none of
these compact expansions has been used for analytical
evaluation of matrix elements of the Breit interaction.

With advance of computer power basis sets became
simpliﬁed that allowed for calculation of numerous ma-
trix elements required for relativistic and QED correc-
tions. The eﬀorts were concentrated on a choice of
a strategy that deﬁnes a sequence of basis functions
genereated. In [7] the double basis set method with gen-
eralyzed Hylleraas basis functions

ψ(r1, r2) =

were used. This double basis set technique along with
full optimization of nonlinear parameters at each basis
set yield substantial progress in accuracy. However, the
main factor that hinder further advance become the nu-
merical instability due to almost linear dependence of the
basis set at large N .

The work of Goldman [8] is a bit apart of the main
path. It recovers the idea of Pekeris [2] to use uncoupled
coordinates and orthogonal Laguerre and Jacoby polyno-
mials as basis functions.

The method expounded in our work is a continuation
of eﬀorts by Drake and Yan to utilize as much simple
basis functions (geminals) as possible.

2. Expansion we want to consider here is very similar
to the generalized Hylleraas basis set, but instead of us-
ing the polynomials over Hylleraas variables we generate
nonlinear parameters in the exponents in a quasi-random
manner,

This method has been successfully used in calculations
[9,10] previously. Obviously, the matrix elements can be
evaluated in the same way as for the generalized Hyller-
aas basis set (1). Moreover, if one replaces real exponents
by complex exponents the integrals will remain exactly
the same as for the real case. In its strategy the method
is very close to the SVM method by Varga, Suzuki [11],
where gaussians are exploited instead.

An important feature of the method is that it demon-
strates a very fast convergence. The general rule which
can be inferred experimentally from the use of the
method is that increasing of the basis by about 200 func-
tions yields about one additional digit in the variational
energy. The minor deﬁciency is that the basis quickly
degenerates when N increases. Already for moderate
N

400 a quadruple precision is required.

Multiprecision package of Fortran routines MPFUN
has been designed by David H. Bailey [12] for computa-
tions with ﬂoating point numbers of an arbitrary length.
Usually it is necessary to make signiﬁcant changes into
Fortran source code in case if Fortran-77 language is used.
Fortunately, the author of MPFUN package has devel-
oped a translator program that facilitate converting the
programs to multiprecision drastically. In general, two
directives incorporated as comments in a source code are
required per one routine. For example a source code for
the considered variational method has been transformed
to multiprecision version within two hours of manual
work. Eventually a code we’ve gotten has been tested
on a personal computer with the Celeron 500 MHz pro-
cessor. For one run with the basis of N = 1400 functions
and 40 decimal digits it requires about 3 hours.

For users of Fortran–90 no preprocessor is needed due
to new advanced features of Fortran–90, such as derived
data types and operator extensions.

ground state as a function of N , the number of basis func-
tions.

In our calculations for the helium ground state four ba-
sis sets with independently optimized nonlinear param-
eters were used. These sets were built up like a pine
tree. The ﬁrst layer was tuned to approximate the gen-
eral behaviour of the solution at intermediate and large
r1 and r2. The second layer was chosen to be ﬂexible in a
smaller region of r1 and r2 and so forth. A detailed opti-
mization was performed for the sets with total N = 1400

and N = 1600. Quadruple precision was not suﬃcient
at these N and we used the multiprecision version of the
program with 40 signiﬁcant decimal digits. Further cal-
culations with N = 1800
2200 were performed with
−
48 signiﬁcant digits and only partial optimization of the
parameters of the last layer (corresponding to the region
where the logarithmic behaviour is the most essential)
was done. Some optimization of a distribution of ni be-
tween the layers (N = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4) was carried out
as well.

As can be seen from the Table II the present result
extends the accuracy of the nonrelativistic ground state
energy for the helium atom by as much as 3 decimal dig-
its.

Second case is the hydrogen molecular ion ground state
that represent an other limit of mass distribution of con-
stituents with one light and two heavy particles. For
this case it is especially essential that we introduce com-
plex exponents, because it is the most natural way to
suit the oscillatory behaviour of the vibrational motion
in the wave function. In this case (see Table III) again
40 decimal digits have been used for N = 1400
1800
and 48 decimal digits for large N to provide the numer-
ical stability of the calculations. Table IV demonstrates
progress in obtaining variational nonrelativistic energy
for this state. The accuracy is extended by as much as 4
additional digits.

In Table V the other examples are summarized. A
negative positronium ion demonstrates a limit of three
particles of equal masses. The second and third cases are
applications of the method to the states with nonzero
angular momentum. The last example in this Table is
of special proud. That is the last vibrational state in a
series of S-states of the hydrogen molecular cation, and
that is the ﬁrst variational conﬁrmation of the existence
of this state (the binding energy corresponding to the
cited value is 0.74421(2) cm−1). The accuracy of the
artiﬁcial channels scattering method [21] is presumably
better, however, wave functions are not forthcoming with
this method that makes diﬃcult calculation of physical
properties of the state other than energy.

3. One may say that this high accuracy is redundant
and has no physical meaning. But obviously, it shows the
power of modern computers and theirs ability to solve the
quantum three–body problem to any required accuracy.
On the other hand, uncertainty in the variational wave
function approximately as much as the square root of
the uncertainty in the variational energy and is about
10−9
10−10. This accuracy does not look redundant.
These results prove that the nonrelativistic bound state
three–body problem is now satisfactorily solved and the
main eﬀorts should be addressed to relativistic and QED
eﬀects.

The other advantage of the method is the simplicity of
the basis functions that allows for evaluate analytically

relativistic matrix elements of the Breit Hamiltonian. It
is possible as well to evaluate analytically the vacuum
polarization term (Uehling potential) [22] and to build
up an eﬀective numerical scheme for the one–loop self–
energy corrections [23]. These features make the consid-
ered variational method to be highly powerful universal
tool for studying the three–body problem.

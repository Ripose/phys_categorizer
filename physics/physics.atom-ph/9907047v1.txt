The photoionization cross section σ, spin-polarization pa-
rameters P and Q, and the angular-distribution asymmetry
parameter β are calculated for the 7s state of francium for
photon energies below 10 eV. Two distinct calculations are
presented, one based on many-body perturbation theory and
another based on the model potential method. Although pre-
dictions of the two calculations are similar, the detailed en-
ergy dependence of the photoionization parameters from the
two calculations diﬀer. From the theoretical p-wave phase
shifts, we infer quantum defects for p1/2 and p3/2 Rydberg
series, permitting us to calculate positions of experimentally
unknown p states in francium.

I. INTRODUCTION

Remarkable progress has been made recently in de-
termining energies and lifetimes of low-lying states of
the heaviest alkali-metal atom francium [1], motivated
in part by the enhancement of parity non-conserving
(PNC) eﬀects in francium compared with other alkali-
metal atoms. This experimental work has been accom-
panied by theoretical studies of properties of the francium
atom [2,3], concerned mostly with energies and hyperﬁne
constants of the ground and low-lying excited states or
transitions between such states.

In this work, we present two calculations of photoion-
ization of francium for photon energies below 10 eV; the
ﬁrst is an ab-initio many-body calculation and the sec-
ond is a model potential (MP) calculation. Experiments
on photoionization of francium are planned for the Ad-
vanced Light Source at Berkeley. [4]

Ab-initio calculations of photoionization in alkali-metal
atoms have proved to be a formidable challenge. Pho-
toionization calculations in cesium based on the Dirac
or Breit-Pauli equations [5–7] accounted for the spin-
orbit interaction, but not for shielding of the dipole op-
erator by the core electrons or for core-polarization ef-
fects; whereas, relativistic calculations that included cor-
rections from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)
at the level of the random-phase-approximation (RPA)
[8,9] accounted for the spin-orbit eﬀects and for core

shielding, but not core polarization. Predictions from
these many-body calculations were in poor agreement
with measurements of the Fano spin-polarization param-
eter P by Heinzmann et al. [10], of the spin-polarization
parameter Q by Lubell et al. [11], and with the measure-
ment of the angular-distribution asymmetry parameter β
by Yin and Elliott [12]. The ﬁrst quantitatively success-
ful many-body calculation of photoionization of cesium
was a relativistic many-body calculation that included
both core polarization and core shielding corrections [13];
that method is applied to low-energy photoionization of
francium in the present paper.

Although successful many-body calculations of pho-
toionization of heavy alkali-metal atoms are of recent vin-
tage, nearly three decades ago, a number of increasingly
sophisticated and successful model potential calculations
of the photoionization of cesium appeared [14–17], cul-
minating with that of Norcross [18]. The latter calcu-
lation, which included the spin-orbit interaction, long-
range polarization potentials, and shielding corrections
to the dipole operator, gave quantitatively correct val-
ues for all of the measured photoionization parameters
in cesium. A model potential similar to the one used
in [18] was developed recently [3] to study transitions in
francium and is used here to study low-energy photoion-
ization in francium.

Below, we sketch the important features of the theo-
retical methods. The photoionization cross sections for
Fr 7s are calculated in Section II.B in both methods and
are compared against one another. In Section II.E, we
give results for the spin-polarization parameters and the
angular distribution asymmetry parameter. Section III
concludes our discussion of the francium photoionization.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION

A. Many-Body Perturbation Theory

We start our many-body analysis from the Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (DHF) VN −1 approximation, in which the
DHF equations are solved self-consistently for core or-
bitals, and the valence orbitals are determined subse-
quently in the ﬁeld of the “frozen core”. The total phase
shift ¯δκ for a continuum state with angular quantum

1

number κ in the ﬁeld of the core is a sum of rapidly vary-
ing Coulomb phase shift δC
κ and the short-range shift δκ.
The short-range DHF phase-shifts for p1/2 and p3/2 con-
tinuum wave functions are shown in Fig. 1. The p3/2 wave
function lags in phase compared to the p1/2 wave func-
tion owing to the spin-orbit interaction, which is attrac-
tive for p1/2 states and repulsive for p3/2 states. The DHF
approximation typically underestimates removal energies
of bound electrons in heavy atoms such as francium by
about 10%; similar accuracy is expected for phase shifts.
To improve this level of accuracy one must take into ac-
count higher-order MBPT corrections.

The clear advantage of the VN −1 approximation stems
from the fact that one-body contributions to the residual
Coulomb interaction vanish. This leads to a signiﬁcant
reduction in the number of terms in the order-by-order
MBPT expansion. In particular, ﬁrst-order corrections
to the energy (or the phase shift) vanish and the pertur-
bation expansion starts in second-order.

The leading correlation contribution to the energy is
the expectation value of the second-order self-energy op-
erator Σ(2), given diagrammatically by the Brueckner-
Goldstone diagrams of Fig. 2. Solutions to the Dirac
equation including the VN −1 potential and the self-energy
operator are called Brueckner orbitals (BO). The non-
local self-energy operator Σ, in the limit of large r, de-
scribes the interaction of an electron with the induced
electric moments of the core,

Here, uǫκ is a continuum DHF wave function normalized
on the energy scale. The resulting DHF+BO phase shifts
are presented in Fig. 1. The attractive polarization po-
tential draws in the nodes of the wave function, resulting
in larger phase shifts. The change in the phase shift is ap-
proximately the same for both p3/2 and p1/2 continuum
states, demonstrating that the self-energy correction is
mainly due to the accumulation of phase outside of the
core.

The angular momentum-dependent parameters, a(j)
, i =
1, ..., 4 and the cut-oﬀ radius r(j)
are obtained through
a non-linear ﬁt to one-electron Rydberg energy levels in
francium [1,2,19]. Because the spin-orbit eﬀects are ap-
preciable for heavy alkali metals, two separate nonlinear
ﬁts; one for each ﬁne-structure series, j+ = ℓ + 1
2 and
1
j− = ℓ
2 were performed. The static dipole polarizabil-
ity was obtained from an extrapolation of the known core
polarizabilities for the other alkali metals as αd(0) = 23.2
a.u. [3]. We note that an ab initio value for the francium
core polarizability is now available [2].

A comparison of short-range phase shifts calculated in
the model-potential method and the MBPT is presented
in Fig. 3. We ﬁnd reasonable agreement between the two
methods. The MP continuum wavefunctions are slightly
lagging in phase compared to many-body wavefunctions.
Such phase diﬀerences result in Cooper minima being
shifted to higher photoelectron momentum in the model-
potential calculation.

C. Quantum defects

In quantum defect (QD) theory [20], the energy levels
of the valence electron are described by a hydrogen-like
Rydberg-Ritz formula

ǫnκ =

in terms of a quantum defect µκ, which is represented
as an expansion in powers of energy with constant coef-
ﬁcients µ(i)

· · ·

(6)

The Rydberg-Ritz formula provides an accurate ﬁtting
expression for the bound spectrum of alkalis. The QD
µ(0)
is related to threshold value of the phase shift as
κ
µ(0)
κ = δκ/π + integer. The QD’s for Fr p states are not
known, since the relevant Rydberg series have not been
observed experimentally. We use our ab-initio threshold
phase shifts together with experimentally known energies
for 7p and 8p states to predict QD’s; thereby approxi-
mating the entire Rydberg spectrum of Fr p states. The
predicted quantum defects are given in Table I. We as-
signed an error bar of 0.5% to the threshold phase shift,
based on the accuracy of an application of the many-body
formalism employed here to the case of Cs [13].

In Table I, we also present the MP values of quantum-
defects obtained by ﬁtting Rydberg series calculated with
the potential in Eq. 3. We ﬁnd generally good agreement
for the leading order quantum-defect µ(0)
κ , estimated in
the two methods. Higher-order QD parameters, µ(1)
κ and
µ(2)
κ , calculated in the two methods do not agree well.

κ . The values for µ(0)

This is due to the sensitivity of these parameters to the
value of µ(0)
κ obtained by ﬁtting to
the MP-calculated np levels agree to four signiﬁcant dig-
its with the values, for µ(0)
κ , extracted from the threshold
phase shifts in Fig. 3.

Using the calculated quantum defects, we predict en-
ergy levels for the lowest few np states. Table II lists
these energies and compares them with the present MP
calculation and with a recent MBPT single-double (SD)
calculation [22]. The accuracy of our many-body calcula-
tion was estimated by exercising upper and lower bounds
κ and µ(2)
on µ(0)
κ
to ﬁt 7p and 8p energies. MBPT results are in reasonable
agreement with the MP calculations and SD predictions
for these levels.

results for the total cross-section are shown with dashed

resulting amplitudes depend on the gauge of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. The diﬀerence between length- and
velocity-form values is especially noticeable in the near-
threshold region.

Second-order corrections, and the associated all-order
sequence of random-phase approximation (RPA) dia-
grams, account for the shielding of the external ﬁeld by
the core electrons. Explicit expressions for the second-
order MBPT corrections can be found, for example, in
Ref. [25]. Already in second order, the dipole operator
with RPA corrections reduces at large r to an eﬀective
one-particle operator

where αd(ω) is a dynamic polarizability of the core. The
ﬁrst term is associated with the applied electric ﬁeld and
the second with the ﬁeld of the induced dipole moment of
the atomic core; the valence electron responds to a sum
of these two ﬁelds. We note that the induced ﬁeld may
become strong and reverse the direction of the total ﬁeld.

The RPA cross-section is presented with a thin solid
line in Fig. 4.
In contrast to DHF amplitudes, the
RPA amplitudes are gauge-independent. Furthermore,
we note the sudden upturn in the RPA cross-section for
the photoelectron momenta p
0.7 a.u. associated with
a J = 1 core excitation resonance. To predict the posi-
tion of this resonance, we calculate the dynamic polariz-
ability of Fr+ within the framework of relativistic RPA,
discussed in [24]. The energy of the ﬁrst resonance is at
ωr = 0.4024 a.u.. Using the DHF value of 7s threshold,
0.1311 a.u., we expect the ﬁrst core excitation resonance
0.74 a.u.. The dynamic polarizability
to appear at p
of Fr core αd(ω) from this RPA calculation is plotted as
a function of electron momentum p in Fig. 5.

To account for core-polarization corrections to the
DHF wave function, discussed in the introduction, we
evaluate the second-order corrections to the DHF wave
functions of the valence electron due to the self-energy

The BO corrections contribute to transition ampli-
tudes starting from third order. Together with the RPA
corrections, they provide the most important third-order
contributions for bound-bound transitions, as discussed
in [25]. In the present approach, we modify the conven-
tional RPA scheme by replacing the valence and contin-
uum wave functions by the approximate Brueckner or-
bitals described above (RPA
BO). Such a modiﬁcation
accounts for the important second- and third-order cor-
relation corrections and for a subset of fourth-order con-
tributions to transition amplitudes. We note that this
fourth-order subset brings the photoionization parame-
ters in cesium into good agreement with available exper-
imental data; therefore, we believe that this approach
will provide reliable predictions for francium. The re-
sulting cross section is shown with a heavy solid line
in Fig. 4, and decomposed into partial cross-sections in
Fig. 7. Calculations using length and velocity forms of
transition operator lead to slightly diﬀerent result in the
BO scheme; we present the ﬁnal result
modiﬁed RPA
in the length form only. Both photoionization channels

partial cross sections, leads to a broad minimum in the
total cross-section slightly below p = 0.45 a.u.. The total
cross section in Fig. 7 is not very sensitive to the posi-
tions of Cooper minima in the p1/2 and p3/2 channels.
Conversely, the spin-polarization and angular distribu-
tion measurements, discussed in the following section,
provide information sensitive to ﬁne details of individual
transition amplitudes.

Fig. 8 examines the total photoionization cross sections
for francium, calculated in the two method. The label
”static” refers to the set of MP results with the core static
dipole polarizability in Eq. 9. The shielding of the elec-
tron dipole operator is truncated in the MP calculations
by introducing a cut-oﬀ term, similar to the exponential
term in the one-electron potential in Eq. 3. The threshold
cross sections in the p1/2 and p3/2 channels (not shown
here) are, respectively, 1.74 and 0.02 Mb. Cooper minima
appear in both channels at approximately, p
0.15 a.u.
0.75 a.u. and the maximum cross section in the
and p
0.2 Mb. The Cooper min-
p1/2 channel is σp1/2 (max)
≈
imum in the p3/2 photoelectron cross section calculated
in the MP method with the static core dipole polarizabil-
ity, occurs approximately where the ﬁrst core resonance
in Fig. 5 becomes excited. By including the dynamic core
polarizability αd(ω) in the MP calculations, the curve la-
beled as ”dynamic” in Fig. 8 is obtained. The Cooper
minima are moved to lower photoelectron momenta, re-
sulting in a shallow minimum in the total cross section
near p

0.5 a.u.

≈

The comparison in Fig. 8 indicates that the cross sec-
tions calculated in the MP method are in general larger
than the MBPT cross sections. The “MP dynamic” and
the MBPT cross sections both rise for the photoelectron
momenta p > 0.5 a.u. to meet the ﬁrst core-excited res-
onance near p

0.75 a.u.

E. Polarization parameters

Fano [10] proposed a measurement of spin polarization
P of photoelectrons emitted from unpolarized Cs atoms
illuminated by circularly polarized photons. The total
spin polarization is expressed in terms of p1/2 and p3/2
transition amplitudes as [23] 1

it is seen that the polarization reaches 100% at momen-
tum p
0.3 a.u. The model-potential results for P are
BO
also given in Fig. 9 and compare well with the RPA
calculation in Fig. 9. Maximum spin polarization in the
MP method occurs at p
0.35 a.u. The calculations
with the static and dynamic core polarizabilities in Eq. 9
are similar and diﬀer only after the maximum is reached.
Lubell and Raith [11] measured a diﬀerent spin-
polarization parameter Q obtained from photoionization
of polarized Cs atoms by a circularly polarized light. In
the Lubell-Raith setup, the p3/2 channel can be accessed
individually, for example, by photoionization with left-
circularly polarized light of the 7s, electron prepared in
the ms = + 1
2 substate. Combining the partial cross sec-
tion σp3/2 thereby obtained with the total cross-section,
permits one to deduce the partial cross-section for the
p1/2 channel. The Lubell-Raith parameter Q is deﬁned
as the ratio of the diﬀerence to the total of the photoab-
sorption intensities for two photon helicities

tween the p3/2 and p1/2 continuum amplitudes and would
constitute an essentially complete description of the pho-
toionization process. The many-body result for β is
shown in Fig. 9. The diﬀerential cross section is pro-
portional to 1

The MP results for Q and the asymmetry parame-
ter β are given also in Fig. 9. The comparison between
MP and MBPT results is generally favorable; the results
with the core dynamics polarizability in Eq. 9 are in bet-
ter qualitative agreement with the MBPT calculations.
We note that near p

the propensity to be ionized perpendicular to the photon

polarization axis and near p

matrix elements used in that work.

III. CONCLUSION

We have calculated the photoionization cross sections
of the ground-state francium. Both many-body and

4

model-potential approaches were employed to obtain the
cross sections, quantum defects, spin-polarization param-
eters and photoelectron asymmetry parameter. We ﬁnd
Cooper minima in both p1/2 and p3/2 channels. The com-
parison between the MBPT and MP results are satisfac-
tory. The Cooper minima predicted in the MP calcu-
lations are at higher photoelectron energies than those
calculated in the MBPT method. The origin of this
diﬀerence can be traced to the shielding of the valence-
electron dipole by the core electrons. The induced dipole
moment of the core manifests itself as a dynamic polar-
izability term. Upon replacing the static core polariz-
ability with the dynamic polarizability, better quantita-
tive agreement with the MBPT results is observed. We
predict the energy-dependence of the photoelectron spin-
polarization and asymmetry parameters which we hope
will stimulate further experimental work in francium.

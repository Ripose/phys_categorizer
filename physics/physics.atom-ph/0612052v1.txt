Abstract

We consider the dynamic escape of a small packet of ultracold atoms launched from within an

optical dipole trap. Based on a theoretical analysis of the underlying nonlinear dynamics, we predict

that fractal behavior can be seen in the escape data. This data would be collected by measuring

the time-dependent escape rate for packets launched over a range of angles. This fractal pattern

is particularly well resolved below the Bose-Einstein transition temperature—a direct result of the

extreme phase space localization of the condensate. We predict that several self-similar layers of

this novel fractal should be measurable and we explain how this fractal pattern can be predicted

and analyzed with recently developed techniques in symbolic dynamics.

Chaotic escape is a widespread transport process underlying such diverse phenomena as

conductance through ballistic microstructures [1], emission from deformed micro-disk semi-

conductor lasers [2], molecular scattering and dissociation [3], celestial transport [4], and

atomic ionization [5, 6]. We have been particularly motivated by the chaotic ionization

of hydrogen in applied parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds, for which a recent theoretical

analysis [6] predicts that the time-spectrum for ionization will display a chaos-induced train

of electron pulses. This prediction is based on classical ionizing trajectories (Fig. 1a), which

propagate from the nucleus into the ionization channel, via the Stark saddle. These tra-

jectories exhibit fractal self-similarity, which is reﬂected in the pulse train. This prediction

has been recently conﬁrmed by full quantum computations [7]. However, the experimental

observation of these chaos-induced pulse trains remains unrealized.

In this Letter, we propose an alternate physical system—the escape of ultracold atoms

in specially tailored optical dipole traps—that exhibits similar escape dynamics. However,

we show that the ﬂexibility and control aﬀorded by cold atoms, especially in engineering

the initial state, should permit the direct imaging of fractals in the escape dynamics, in-

cluding novel self-similar features. Furthermore, we show how this self-similarity can be

analyzed using a recently developed symbolic formalism. Fundamentally, these fractals re-

sult from homoclinic tangles [8]—a general mechanism for phase space transport. Hence this

Letter suggests that cold atoms could serve as a unique high-precision experimental probe

of this mechanism. Finally, the cold atom experiments discussed here are readily feasible

with present-day experimental conﬁgurations and should prove easier to realize than the

previously mentioned ionization experiments.

Recent experiments from the Raizen [9] and Davidson [10] groups have made ﬁrst steps

along these lines. They independently measured the long-time survival probability for ul-

tracold atoms escaping through a hole in an optical billiard, demonstrating the distinction

between regular and chaotic escape dynamics. In contrast, our Letter focuses on the short-

to intermediate-time dynamics, where fundamentally distinct phenomena, such as fractal

self-similarity, are predicted to appear.

The double-Gaussian trap: We consider a dipole potential consisting of two overlapping

2

Gaussian wells

V (x, y) = −V1 exp(−[(x/σ1x)2 + (y/σ1y)2]/2)

− V2 exp(−[((x − x2)/σ2x)2 + (y/σ2y)2]/2),

(1)

as shown in Fig. 1b. This potential can be created by two red-detuned, far-oﬀ-resonant

Gaussian beams; atomic motion can be further restricted transverse to the xy-plane by

a uniform laser sheet. Here, we take σ1x = 0.18, σ1y = 0.24, σ2x = 1.08, σ2y = 0.24,

x2 = 0.72 (measured in millimeters), and V1 = V2 = 35.5 (measured in recoil energies
Er = ~2k2
L/2mRb = h · 3.77 kHz, where λ = 2π/kL = 780.2 nm for the D2 transition of
87Rb.) The double-Gaussian potential shares several features in common with the hydrogen

potential in Fig. 1a. The “primary” Gaussian centered at the origin is analogous to the

Coulomb well; the elongated “secondary” Gaussian on the right is analogous to the ionization

channel; and the saddle connecting the two Gaussian wells is analogous to the Stark saddle.

We are interested in the transport of atoms from the primary well into the secondary well.

Fig. 1b shows two representative trajectories that move away from the origin with initial

speed 4.12 cm/s, pass over an unstable periodic orbit (PO) near the saddle, and then strike a

resonant laser sheet (the vertical dashed line.) This sheet forms a detection line that serves

both to image the escaping atoms and to scatter them out of the trap, preventing their

return into the primary well.

Figure 2a plots the time for a trajectory with initial speed 4.12 cm/s (energy -14.9 D2

recoils) to move from the origin to the detection line, as a function of launch angle θ,

measured relative to the positive x axis. The resulting escape-time plot is highly singular,

with numerous icicle-shaped regions whose edges tend toward inﬁnity. These “icicles” exhibit

a self-similar fractal pattern. Such patterns also occur in the chaotic ionization of hydrogen

and are characteristic of chaotic escape and scattering.

A proposed experiment to measure self-similar patterns in the escape-time plot: We con-

sider a small Gaussian packet of ultracold atoms launched from the origin with speed 4.12

cm/s and θ = 2.04 (the right line in Fig. 2a). The subsequent ﬂux of atomic trajectories at

the detection line is then computed as a function of time. Fig. 3a shows this ﬂux for an initial

thermal packet that occupies a phase space area 500 times Planck’s constant in both the x

and y degrees of freedom. Fig. 3b, on the other hand, uses a packet that occupies a single

Planck cell, appropriate for a pure dilute Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in the regime

3

of negligible interactions. The condensate packet closely follows the trajectory in Fig. 1b,

exiting as a sharp pulse at 160 ms, near the bottom of the θ = 2.04 icicle in Fig. 2a. The

thermal packet also produces a pulse at 160 ms, but its larger phase space extent populates

neighboring icicles, thereby producing the additional pulses in Fig. 3a.

By repeating the preceding computation for diﬀerent launch angles of the thermal packet,

we obtain the aggregate data in Fig. 2b, where the shading records the atomic ﬂux as a

function of arrival time and the packet’s launch angle. Fig. 3a then corresponds to the

vertical slice through Fig. 2b at θ = 2.04. The thermal data appear as a blurred version

of the sharp escape-time plot. For example, the left and right icicles are associated with

prominent dark patches, and in between a few wispy patches can be associated with the

bottoms of other icicles. Overall, however, the intricate icicle structure is poorly resolved

by the thermal data.

A remarkable increase in resolution occurs below the BEC transition, shown in Fig. 4i.

Many icicles are now clearly resolved, a direct consequence of the high phase-space localiza-

tion aﬀorded by the condensate. This increase in resolution prompts us to look deeper into

the fractal, with the expectation that we can directly measure its ﬁne-scale structure.

Self-similarity of the escape-time data: The ﬁrst column of Fig. 4 shows data plotted for

three distinct intervals of the launch angle. (We concentrate at present on the upper plot in

each pair.) The three plots look remarkably similar, and icicles in one plot can be identiﬁed

with icicles in the other two. In fact, this pattern of icicles occurs throughout the escape-

time plot and on all scales. (See below.) One of the principal observations of this Letter is

that these structures are resolved by the overlaid BEC data. The icicles look progressively

more blurred as we move down the column because the interval width is decreasing and the

escape time is increasing.

The pattern in the ﬁrst column of Fig. 4 is not the only repeated pattern. The second

column of Fig. 4 shows another pattern that also occurs on all scales throughout the same

escape-time plot. As we will see, many such repeated patterns, or templates, exist in the

escape-time plot. Within a given template, all other templates can be found on smaller

scales. That is, each template occurs as a subtemplate of every other template in an inﬁnitely

recursive nesting. Our computations predict that several nested layers will be experimentally

visible.

Experimentally, the observation of these phenomena will not be easy but certainly fea-

4

sible. With a 1.06 µm laser, the above trap geometry can be realized with about 80 W
of power. With this detuning, a 87Rb atom has at most a 4% probability of spontaneous

scattering over a half second. Acceleration of the atoms to the initial velocity of 4.12 cm/s is

easily accomplished; for example, a chirped, one-dimensional optical lattice of 785 nm light

with 50 mW of single-beam power and beam radius w0 = 100 µm can accelerate the atoms

in about 1.6 ms with negligible (< 1%) probability of spontaneous scattering and heating

due to energy-band transitions. The primary diﬃculty is the subrecoil initial conditions

required, even in the thermal case. However, a standard expanded BEC should suﬃce.

Theoretical foundations of the fractal structure: We next describe how the self-similar

fractal data can be described with recently developed symbolic tools [11]. We ﬁrst specify a

two-dimensional surface of section in the xypxpy-phase space by ﬁxing the energy E at -14.9

D2 recoils and setting y = 0. Thus, every time a trajectory passes through the x-axis, we

can record (x, px), deﬁning a Poincar´e map that maps a given intersection (x, px) forward
to the next intersection (x′, p′

x). Fig. 5 shows the corresponding surface-of-section plot. The

vertical line L0 at x = 0 consists of all points at the origin moving outward with arbitrary

launch angle θ. The point zX is the unstable ﬁxed point equal to the intersection of the

unstable periodic orbit (PO) in Fig. 1b with the surface of section. Attached to zX are its

stable S (thick) and unstable U (thin) manifolds, consisting of all points that asymptote to

zX in the forward and backward directions, respectively. These manifolds intersect an inﬁnite

number of times, forming an intricate pattern called a homoclinic tangle [8, 11, 12, 13]. The

segments of the stable and unstable manifolds connecting zX to the point P0 deﬁne the

shaded region called the “complex”.

Escape from the complex occurs via escape lobes En, deﬁned in Fig. 5 as the regions

bounded by the stable and unstable segments connecting Pn to Qn. The lobe E−1, inside

the complex, maps to E0, outside the complex. Once in E0 a point then maps to E1, E2, etc.,

eventually passing into the secondary well on the right. The lobes E−k contain all points

that escape in k iterates. These lobes become progressively more stretched and folded as

k increases. (An analogous sequence of lobes Cn controls capture into the complex.) Note

that we are able to chose physical parameters that make the lobes quite large compared to

Planck’s constant (Fig. 5).

We plot as a function of θ the number of iterates for a point to escape the complex, shown

as the lower plot of each pair in Fig. 4. These plots straighten each icicle into a constant

5

escape segment. A segment that escapes on iterate k is an intersection between E−k and L0.

For example, the segment at iterate two in Fig. 4i is the intersection with E−2 in Fig. 5.

Ref. [11] introduces a symbolic technique, called homotopic lobe dynamics, to compute

the structure of escape segments based on the tangle topology. (See also Refs. [12].) We

summarize the results obtained from applying this technique to the tangle in Fig. 5.

The structure of the discrete-escape-time plot up to a given iterate n is speciﬁed by a
string ℓn of symbols in the set {c1, c2, a, b, f, u0, u1, u2, ...} as well as their inverses, e.g. c−1
1 .
The ﬁrst string is ℓ1 = u1b−1u0. All subsequent strings can be obtained from the ﬁrst by

mapping each symbol forward according to the substitution rules:

c1 7→ c2,

a 7→ b−1u−1

0 b,

un 7→ un+1,

0 f,

c2 7→ f −1u0au−1
1 u−1
b 7→ b−1u−1

f 7→ c−1

0 f,

0 f,

using the standard convention for iterating inverses, e.g. b−1 7→ f −1u0b. For example, the

ﬁrst four strings are:

ℓ1 = u1b−1u0,

ℓ2 = u2f −1u0bu1,

ℓ3 = u3f −1u0c1u1b−1u−1

0 f u2,

ℓ4 = u4f −1u0c1u1c2u2f −1u0bu−1

1 c−1

1 u−1

0 f u3.

An ℓn string encodes the discrete-escape-time plot as follows. Each appearance of u±1

0

in ℓn

(underlined for emphasis) represents a segment that escapes at iterate n. For example, the

u0 factor in Eq. (3a) corresponds to the escape segment at iterate one in Fig. 4i. This u0
factor then maps forward to u1 in Eq. (3b). In general, we see that each u±1
k

in ℓn represents

a segment that escapes at iterate n − k.

In Eq. (3b), another u0 factor has appeared,

corresponding to the escape segment at iterate two. This segment is to the left of the ﬁrst

segment, just as the u0 factor in Eq. (3b) is to the left of the u1 factor. In general, the
left-right ordering of u±1
k

symbols in ℓn represents the left-right ordering of segments in the

discrete-escape-time plot. On the next two iterates, two new u0 factors appear in Eq. (3c),

and three more appear in Eq. (3d), in agreement with Fig. 4i.

All other symbols besides u±1
k

represent gaps between adjacent escape segments. For
example, b−1 in Eq. (3a) represents the gap b−1(i) in Fig. 4i, and b−1 in Eq. (3c) represents

6

(2b)

(2c)

(3a)

(3b)

(3c)

(3d)

the gap b−1(ii) in Figs. 4i and 4ii. The string ℓ5 will also contain a b−1 factor, representing
the gap b−1(iii) in Figs. 4ii and 4iii. Since each b−1 factor generates exactly the same string
of symbols under Eqs. (2), each gap labeled b−1 in Fig. 4 contains the same pattern of escape
segments. This means that b−1 corresponds to a particular template, i.e. to ﬁnd occurrences
of this template in the escape-time plot, we need only look for occurrences of b−1 in the

expression for ℓn.

three times yields

It follows from the above logic that each symbol {c1, c2, a, b, f } generates its own template,
with inverse symbols generating reﬂected templates. For example, mapping f −1 forward

f −1u0c1u1c2u2f −1u0au−1

0 f.

(4)

The reader may verify that Eq. (4) describes the segments up to iterates ﬁve, seven, and

six in Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c. Note that diﬀerent experimental parameters will yield diﬀerent

algebraic rules and diﬀerent templates.

This algebraic formalism computes a minimal set of escape segments, but generally not

all segments. That is, at later times, we typically ﬁnd additional segments in the numerics.

This illustrates what has previously been called an epistrophic fractal [13]. Nevertheless,

unpredicted segments can be accommodated within an updated algebraic formalism, as

explained in Ref. [11].

Conclusions: We predict that experiments on the intermediate-time escape dynamics of

ultracold atoms from an optical trap can directly image fractals. The resolution is particu-

larly good when using a BEC. The fractal structure depends on the topology of homoclinic

tangles, which are common to numerous chaotic systems. Such experiments would thus pro-

vide a new laboratory tool for the study of an important chaotic mechanism. Similarly, an

improved understanding of the chaotic escape pathways of atoms from optical traps could

be relevant for the understanding of mixing and thermalization in traps and for the control

and coherent emission of atomic wavepackets. Finally, the dependence of these fractals on

atom density could serve as an interesting probe of atom-atom interactions, a subject to be

explored in future work.

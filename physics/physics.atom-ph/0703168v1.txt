Eﬀects of nonintegrability on stabilization of Feshbach molecules in atom waveguides

V. A. Yurovsky

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Deactivation of broad quasi-one-dimensional dibosonic molecules is analyzed. Within integrable
Lieb-Liniger-McGuire (LLMG) model an exact expression does not demonstrate suppression of the
deactivation at low collision energies. Solution of Faddeev equations demonstrates that when a
Feshbach resonance lifts the symmetry of the LLMG model the deactivation becomes suppressed.
This eﬀect shows a way for formation of a stable gas of dibosonic Feshbach molecules.

Ultracold molecules have recently been formed by Fes-
hbach resonance association (see reviews [1] and original
works [2, 3]). These Feshbach molecules are very broad
since they are superpositions of the closed and open chan-
nels. However, inelastic collisions of atoms and molecules
lead to strong losses of molecules composed from Bose
atoms in experiments [2]. In the fermionic case [3] inelas-
tic collisions are strongly suppressed due to Pauli block-
ing and weak coupling of the atoms [4]. This eﬀect allows
investigation of BEC-BCS crossover and other phenom-
ena of fundamental physical importance.

Tight conﬁnement of atomic motion in two directions
by atom waveguides strongly modiﬁes atomic collisions in
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) regime, when the transverse
excitation energy ω⊥ (in units where ¯h = 1) substantially
exceeds the collision energies [5]. This regime has been
realized in 2D optical lattices [6, 7], elongated atomic
traps [8], and atomic integrated optics devices [9]. Broad
quasi-1D molecules, predicted in [10] and observed in [7],
have binding energies less then ω⊥. Such diatoms can be
described by two-channel 1D model [11, 12], where the
closed channel incorporates both 3D closed channel and
excited transverse waveguide modes.

Rates of deactivation into tightly bound (non-
Feshbach) states are approximately proportional to the
probability to ﬁnd three atoms (two of which belong to
to three-body
the molecule) in the same place, e. g.
(3B) correlations [4]. 3B correlations were analyzed in
[13] within exactly-soluble Lieb-Liniger model [14].
In
this model 1D bosons interact by zero-range potentials
zl), where zj are atomic coordinates and the
Uaδ (zj −
interaction strength Ua is energy-independent.
In the
case of repulsive interactions (Ua > 0), which does not
bound the atoms, the correlations are suppressed at low
collision energies and strong interactions [13]. Bound
states can be formed in the case of attractive interactions
(Ua < 0) described by the McGuire solution [15]. The
tree-atom correlations for atom and diatom with relative
momentum p0 can be represented, using 3B wavefunction
ϕ0 (z1, z2, z3) [15], as

are cardinally diﬀerent from collisions of two structure-
less particles, which are suppressed both within the Lieb-
Liniger-McGuire (LLMG) model [13] and beyond it [16].
This diﬀerence reﬂects the fact that broad Feshbach
molecules can not be considered as zero-range objects
and their deactivation is not a 2B process.

±

The present Letter demonstrates that deactivation of
broad 1D molecules becomes suppressed when integra-
bility of LLMG model is lifted by a Feshbach resonance.
Similar eﬀects can be expected for other mechanisms of
integrability lifting, e. g. due to virtual transverse mode
excitation [18, 19]. In contrast with these eﬀects, other
processes, such as reﬂection and dissociation in atom-
diatom collisions and three-atom association [17], become
allowed when the nonintegrability is lifted.

Except of demonstration of a new observable eﬀect of
non-integrability, which is interesting for atomic, molec-
ular, and statistical physics, as well as for quantum ﬁeld
theory, present results show a way for formation of a sta-
ble gas of dibosonic Feshbach molecules.

Consider multichannel collisions of 1D Bose atoms de-
scribed by the annihilation operators ˆΨa (z). The model
includes several 2B channels (see Fig. 1). The Feshbach
closed-channel state, described by the molecular annihi-
lation operator ˆΨc (z), lies at the energy Dc close to the

open channel threshold, which serves as the energy origin.
A set of deactivation product channels
, described by
the molecular annihilation operators ˆΨd (z), lie at the
energies Dd far below the open channel threshold. The
system can be described by the Hamiltonian

are couplings of the open and closed channels, respec-

ters of atomic collisions and the waveguide [11, 12] [see
Eq. (15) below].

pressed as [12]

If the non-resonant case (g = 0, ϕc = 0) the problem
is reduced to the LLMG model [14, 15], which has an
exact Bethe-ansatz solution. In agreement with [4], K1D
of Eq. (11) is proportional to the three-atom correlations
(1), which does not describe suppression of deactivation.
A physical sense of this eﬀect can be explained by a
simple 2B analogy. Consider a collision of 1D atom and
molecule with coordinates y and x, respectively. The
wavefunction of this system has the form of ϕ (y, x) =
exp (ip0 (y
), where R is the re-
x
|
ﬂection amplitude.
In the LLMG model atom-diatom
reﬂection is forbidden, R = 0, and the 2B analogy leads
to ϕ (0, 0) = 1 + R = 1. The 3B model results in Eq. (1),
which has a non-zero value too since the three atoms can
approach each other.

However, reﬂection becomes allowed when integrabil-
ity of the LLMG model is lifted e.g. by a Feshbach res-
onance [17]. Moreover, reﬂection becomes the dominant
channel at low collision energy, preventing approaching
of the atoms and leading to suppression of deactivation.
This hypothesis is conﬁrmed by numerical calculations.
As the coeﬃcients γ are independent of the collision en-
ergy and resonance detuning in both models, (3) and
(14), the behavior of the deactivation rate (11) is de-
termined by the three-atom correlations for the open
2 channels, see Fig.

less parameters: the non-resonant interaction strength

tuning b, where D0 is the energy scale. In the quasi-1D

example, in a waveguide with the transverse frequency
ω⊥ = 50
2π KHz, collisions remain quasi-1D for the
collision energy less then 2.4µK. In vicinity of b = 0, Eq.
(15) gives D0 = 3µK, u = 0.024, and dB/db = 34 mG for
the Na resonance at 907 G and D0 = 2.5µK, u = 0.12,
and dB/db = 27 mG for the 87Rb resonance at 1007 G.
Figure 2 demonstrates that the correlations and, there-
fore, the deactivation rate K1D decrease proportionally
to the collision energy for slow collisions, when the to-
tal elastic reﬂection is approached. It is surprising that
non-integrability leads to the same low-energy behavior
of deactivation rate of broad molecules as in collisions of
structureless particles [13, 16]. At rather high collision
energy, when the elastic reﬂection probability decreases,
correlations in the open channel follow to the LLMG
model. Deactivation suppression persists in a wide range
of the resonance detunings and the non-resonant interac-
tion strengths (see Fig. 3).

The foregoing results are related to high deactivation
energies
. The case of low deactivation energies can
be considered within the two-channel model [17]. A Fes-

hbach molecule can have two bound states at Ua < 0
2/Ua, when Eq. (10) has two real positive
and Dc < 2
|
solutions, κ1 > κ0. Collision with third atom can lead to
transitions between the corresponding states, and foreign
deactivation product states are not more necessary. This
case is exactly described by Eqs. (4), (6), (7) and (12).
The deactivation rate is given by Eq. (8), which includes
now a singe term (n = 1) only. It is again proportional
to the collision energy for slow collisions (see Fig. 4). De-
activation suppression correlates with the increase in the
elastic reﬂection probability in this model too.

In summary, the integrable LLMG model does not pre-
dict suppression of deactivation of broad 1D molecules,
demonstrating their diﬀerence from compact molecules.
The deactivation becomes suppressed when the symme-
try of LLMG model is lifted by Feshbach resonance. This
eﬀect is predicted by the two-channel model, as well as by
two multichannel models with diﬀerent interactions, (3)

and (14). Dibosonic Feshbach molecules in atom waveg-
uides become thus relatively stable, like difermionic ones
in free space. Thus, both the presence [17] and suppres-
sion of certain processes are among the observable eﬀect
of non-integrability.

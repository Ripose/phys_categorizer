Theory for the Rabi and internal Josephson eﬀects in an interacting Bose gas in the cold collision
regime is presented. By using microscopic transport equation for the density matrix the problem is
mapped onto a problem of precession of two coupled classical spins. In the absence of an external
excitation ﬁeld our results agree with the theory for the density induced frequency shifts in atomic
clocks. In the presence of the external ﬁeld, the internal Josephson eﬀect takes place in a condensed
Bose gas as well as in a non-condensed gas. The crossover from Rabi oscillations to the Josephson
oscillations as a function of interaction strength is studied in detail.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent experiments achieving the trapping and Bose condensation of atoms with hyperﬁne structure [1–7] have
created a lot of theoretical interest in the behavior of atomic gases with internal degrees of freedom [8–15]. Most of
this interest has focused on how the presence of internal degrees of freedom eﬀect the spatial behavior, such as the
hydrodynamical modes or vortices. An equally important question posed by these experiments is how the internal
states of the atoms are eﬀected by interactions.

In a variety of experiments the transitions between internal states are used to either manipulate or probe cold
gases. Fountain atomic clocks [16–19] use Ramsey spectroscopy technique to measure the energy diﬀerences between
internal states very precisely, and have found that this energy diﬀerence depends on the densities of the diﬀerent
internal states in the gas. Another class of experiments have used Electromagnetically Induced Transparency [20]
techniques to excite the atoms into a superposition of internal states by absorbing a ‘probe’ beam and were able
reemit the beam after some delay. These experiments measured the change in the ‘stopped’ light beam as the gas
evolved in the superposition state [21,22]. Both of these classes of experiments measure the internal dynamics of the
atoms in a normal gas. Experiments involving change in the internal state of the atoms have also been carried out
on Bose Einstein Condensates (BEC). In the MIT spin polarized Hydrogen experiment [23,24], BEC was detected
by changing the internal states of the atoms from 1S to 2S using a two photon excitation. Two photon transitions
have also been successfully employed by the JILA group in a number of experiments to create topological excitations
[25,26] or phase textures [27] in a Rubidium BEC. One can expect many related experiments to be carried out in near
future as the study of cold atomic gases is a rapidly expanding ﬁeld.

Although all these experiments try to elucidate the internal dynamics of a cold gas, it is useful to classify them into
two groups with respect to the strength of the external ﬁeld that couples to the internal states. In the weak ﬁeld limit,
experiments probe the internal dynamics of a gas of atoms in the absence of an external ﬁeld. For example, in the
atomic clock experiments, although strong ﬁelds at the beginning and the end of Ramsey spectroscopy are required,
an essentially free evolution of the wavefunction in a superposition of two internal states is measured. In the MIT
hydrogen experiment [23], the number of excited atoms is a small fraction of the total number, and thus all the eﬀects
measured are linear in the excitation rate. Thus the external ﬁeld is only a weak probe of the free dynamics. On the
other hand, in the strong ﬁeld limit the internal dynamics is sensitive to the intensity of the external ﬁeld, and the
number of atoms changing their internal state form a large fraction that may reach 100%. In the JILA experiments,
by applying a π pulse all the atoms are transferred from one internal state to the other, and duration of the pulse is
the inverse of Rabi frequency, showing that the internal dynamics depends on the strength of the external ﬁeld. It
should be also kept in mind that in all these experiments, even in the weak ﬁeld limit, the external ﬁeld has large
enough number of quanta to be treated as a classical ﬁeld. Also we will assume throughout that the excitation is
carried out by a coherent ﬁeld.

The interaction between two atoms generally depends on their internal states [28,29]. For the dilute cold gases
considered in this work, interactions can be simply characterized by the s-wave scattering lengths aαβ which depend
on the internal states α and β of the interacting atoms. Thus a two state problem will have three diﬀerent scattering
lengths. To be in the purely s-wave scattering limit the gas has to be cold enough, so that

(1)

a
λT ≪

where a is the largest of the s-wave scattering lengths in the problem and λT = h(2πmkbT )−1/2 is the thermal de
Broglie wavelength. The temperature range deﬁned by the criterion (1) corresponds to the so-called cold collision
regime.

It is important to realize that the inequality (1) not only deﬁnes the condition for the s-wave scattering to be
dominant, but also is a criterion for quantum statistical eﬀects (indistinguishibility of the particles) to be observable.
To see this, consider an evolution of the state of one particular atom. This atom will experience two diﬀerent kinds
of scattering processes: the coherent forward and backward scattering which preserves correlation of the momentum
state with the internal state, as well as ordinary elastic collisions causing scattering at an angle diﬀerent from 0 or π
which destroy this correlation [30,31]. The forward and backward processes occur with the ‘rate’

while the ordinary elastic collisions rate is

(3)

where vT =
2kBT /m is the thermal velocity. Comparing these two rates one can see that the coherent processes
happen at a much higher rate in the temperature range (1). It is then possible to measure the frequency shifts of
the internal states and decide the statistics of the system. The gases satisfying the condition (1) are called quantum
gases [30–33].

For the densities relevant for the alkali gas experiments, the temperatures below which the gas becomes quantum
in the sense (1) are much larger than the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature.
[This is true because quantum
degeneracy becomes important only at the lower temperatures for which the thermal de Broglie wavelength is the
n−1/3.] For Bose systems the substantial overlap between wavefunctions
order of average interparticle spacing, λT ≃
of diﬀerent particles and bosonic tendency to be in the same state then causes Bose–Einstein condensation, where
a ﬁnite fraction of the particles of the gas share the same spatial wavefunction. The internal states of the particles
deﬁne the interactions between the particles, thus determine the self-consistent spatial wavefunction that all the
particles share [1,3], transition between internal states are also eﬀected in return. Most importantly, there are no
backward(exchange) scatterings between two bosons sharing the same spatial wavefunction, and the mean ﬁeld energy
shift for a particle in the condensate is diﬀerent from a particle in the normal gas.

An important example of the modiﬁcation of the transitions between the internal states upon condensation is
given by the internal Josephson eﬀect [34–38,29].
In this eﬀect, the internal states act as the two reservoirs and
the external ﬁeld provides the weak link between these two reservoirs similar to the tunneling coupling through a
barrier in the ordinary spatial Josephson eﬀect [39–42]. Although the JILA experiments [2,3] have come close, the
internal Josephson eﬀect has not been observed in the alkali gases to date, mostly due to the fact that the shape of
the condensate is diﬀerent for the two internal states. Any transition between the two internal states causes spatial
disturbances, making the internal Josephson oscillations hard to observe. It should however be possible observe the
eﬀect by either using a very shallow trap or going to the adiabatic limit in which the Rabi frequency for transitions
is much larger than the oscillation frequencies of the condensate in the trap [34,29]. We will consider the case of a
homogeneous gas and investigate the Internal Josephson eﬀect, having in mind a gas sample in a very shallow trap.
To understand these diﬀerent phenomena in a general framework, we ﬁrst derive the transport equation for the
density matrix of the system, treating the external degrees of freedom semi–classically. The transport equation can be
used to understand transitions between internal states of a Bose gas in the presence of spatial non-uniformity caused
by a trapping potential, as well as in the presence of macroscopic ﬂows, such as currents created by a vortex.

Below we focus on the dynamics of internal states in a spatially uniform system. We assume that all the excitation
ﬁelds are applied uniformly on a homogeneous sample. We ﬁnd the equations of motion for the internal state density
matrix of both the normal component and the condensed part of a Bose gas. Then we use a Bloch sphere representation
[46] for the density matrix to get an equivalent equation of motion for classical spins.

After deriving the equations of motion we consider two simple cases: a normal gas and a fully condensed gas.
We ﬁnd the free precession frequencies for the relative phase of two internal states, which leads to an expression for
the density dependence of the frequency shift in fountain atomic clocks. Our results for the normal gas agree with
previous work [43–45], and we present a new result for the fully condensed case.

Then we investigate the response of the Bose gas to an external ﬁeld when it is either above condensation temperature
or at zero temperature, i.e. fully condensed. For the fully condensed Bose gas we show how the Rabi oscillations in
a non-interacting gas turn into the internal Josephson oscillations, and calculate the oscillation frequencies exactly
for the entire parameter range. By repeating the same analysis for a non-condensed gas, we ﬁnd that the internal
Josephson eﬀect exists in a cold non-condensed gas. This somewhat surprising result shows that the Josephson eﬀect
does not require a broken symmetry, and can be observed in any coherent system. We calculate the frequencies for

2

the normal case and compare with the results for condensed gas. We also compare the internal Josephson oscillations
with the spatial Josephson oscillations discussed in [39–42] and show that ‘macroscopic quantum self trapping’ eﬀect
is also present for the internal Josephson eﬀect.

In the next section, we study the internal dynamics of a Bose gas which has comparable densities of condensed and
normal components. We ﬁrst discuss the dynamics without an external coupling ﬁeld and calculate the oscillation
frequencies for the condensate density in each internal state. In the limit of small oscillation amplitude out result
agrees with the resonance frequencies calculated for the MIT hydrogen spectrum [33]. We brieﬂy discuss the behavior
of the system under a strong external ﬁeld.

Finally we give the transport equation and the equations of motion for the internal density matrix of a Fermi gas.
We consider a freely precessing state and its response to an external ﬁeld, and compare the results with those for the
Bose gas.

Let us summarize here the approximations used to derive the above equations and assess their validity. The Hartree-
Fock approximation is used to treat interactions, that is the same as keeping the lowest order term in the expansion
in the gas parameter na3. This is an excellent approximation for the dilute atomic gases where na3 is usually about
10−6.

The most important restriction on the above equations (17,18) is that they are valid for times not longer than the

elastic scattering time

τ −1
coll = 4πa2nvT .
However, for a cold gas the characteristic frequency of the evolution described by (17,18) is much higher than τ −1
coll,
and this approximation gets better as the temperature is decreased. The decoherence due to elastic collisions can be
described heuristically by adding a damping term

on the right hand side of Eq.(17).

All other eﬀects, such as the diﬀerence of the trap potential for diﬀerent internal states, or density oscillations
created by a change in the internal state are adequately described by (17,18) within the Hartree-Fock approximation.

III. EQUATION OF MOTION FOR THE INTERNAL DENSITY MATRIX

Our main interest in this paper will be the consequences of interparticle interactions in the internal state dynamics,
so we will simplify the above general equations by assuming that we are in a uniform system, with no normal or
condensate ﬂows, and further assume that the external ﬁelds are applied uniformly. In this case we will have no need
for the full density matrix ̺(r, p), as internal dynamics is completely described ρ(r) which will be the same at all
points r.

Thus equations of motion reduce to

The dynamics described in the above equations are fairly complicated if there are ﬁelds coupling more then two
states, so we will concentrate on the simplest case, where only two internal states are coupled, and all the populations
in the other states remain constant. In this case we will be concerned with the dynamics of two, two by two matrices.
One for the normal gas and one for the condensate. Let us assume that states 1 and 2 are coupled. We can go to a
Larmor basis with the frequency of the coupling ﬁeld so that the elements of our density matrix (and similarly the
condensate matrix) can be redeﬁned. The diagonal elements of the matrices do not change while the oﬀ-diagonal
elements change as

In this basis we will ﬁnd it useful to rewrite the equations of motion in the Bloch representation [46]. Being 2 by 2

hermitian matrices we can expand,

In this representation ¯ρ0 and ρ0 will be proportional to the total number of atoms in the condensate, and above the
condensate respectively. The z components of both spins are proportional to the population diﬀerence between the
two internal states, belonging to the normal gas or the condensate. For the normal part, the norm of the projection
of spin onto the x
y plane represents the degree of coherence between the two internal states. For the condensate
spin however, this norm is directly proportional to the geometric mean of the populations of the two internal states.
The angle corresponding to a rotation around the z axis is related to the relative phase of the two internal states, in
both cases.

Let us brieﬂy remind what the physical bases for various terms in the Hamiltonian are. The factor of 2 diﬀerence in
the normal spin–normal spin interaction compared to the condensate spin–condensate spin interaction stems from the
fact that there are no exchange scatterings within the condensate. The terms coupling the condensate spin with the
normal spin arise from processes in which an atom in one internal state goes through an exchange scattering process
with a condensate atom in another internal state.

IV. DENSITY SHIFTS IN ATOMIC CLOCKS: FREE PRECESSION OF A SINGLE SPIN

We start the analysis of the dynamics described in Eq.(27) by considering the situation in which we can represent
the system by a single spin. There are two such cases. The ﬁrst is at zero temperature, when almost all the atoms
are in the condensate; while the second is above the transition temperature, when there is no condensate present.
However, our analysis is still restricted to temperatures low enough to satisfy the quantum gas condition, λT > as.

We ﬁrst analyze equations of motion Eq.(27) in the case where there is no external ﬁeld. Such an analysis is needed
to understand any interaction related eﬀects in experiments where particles spend a substantial amount of time in a
superposition state, such as atomic clocks [16–19].

Let us ﬁrst consider the case where there is no Bose condensation. Thus our equations (27) will be reduced to

~S = ~S

~Bn.

×

We can easily see that the z component of the spin will be conserved and we will only have a precession around the

z axis and the precession frequency will be

ω = (w2 −

w1) + 2(λ22n2 −

λ11n1 + λ12(n1 −

n2)) +

(λ2γ −

λ1γ)nγ.

Xγ6=1,2
This result agrees with the theory of frequency shifts in atomic clocks [43–45].

We can now ask the same question for a sample which is fully condensed. When all the atoms are in the condensate,
they will all be sharing the same spatial wavefunction, this will mean that no exchange processes will be possible.
That would eliminate the factor of 2 multiplying the combination of λ and n’s for states one and two in the previous
equation. Not surprisingly we get, for a fully condensed sample

ω = (w2 −

w1) + (λ22n2 −

λ11n1 + λ12(n1 −

n2)) +

(λ2γ −

λ1γ)nγ.

Xγ6=1,2

Although it is not desirable to use a condensate in a fountain atomic clock due to very high density shifts that
would result. We see here that such an experiment can be used to probe the correlations in a condensate by simply
looking at the density induced frequency shifts.

V. INTERNAL JOSEPHSON EFFECT: SINGLE SPIN UNDER AN EXTERNAL FIELD

In this section we consider the response to an external ﬁeld, only when the system can be represented by a single
spin, i.e. the system is either fully condensed or not condensed at all. In the former case, when the system is at zero
temperature we have two condensates in internal states 1 and 2, which are connected by the “weak link” supplied by
the external ﬁeld. This is the well studied problem of the internal Josephson eﬀect [34–38].

The important diﬀerence between the spatial Josephson problem and the internal Josephson problem is that in
the latter atoms in diﬀerent internal states interact, while in the former two particles in diﬀerent reservoirs do not.
However if the interaction between the two internal states is taken to be zero

then equations for the internal Josephson problem reduce to that of the spatial problem [40–42]. thus the internal
eﬀect displays all the phenomena the spatial Josephson eﬀect has.

As in the spatial Josephson problem there are three diﬀerent regimes depending on the strength of the coupling

between the internal states [29]. If the external ﬁeld is much stronger than the interactions

the system is said to be in the Rabi regime. (Here λ can be taken to be the largest of λαβ and n the total density.) In
this regime interactions are not important and the system experiences large oscillations in the density of each internal
state. In the opposite regime, when the external ﬁeld is extremely weak,

the system is in the Fock regime. The amplitude of density oscillations is negligible and the phase diﬀerence between
the two states evolves as in the free precession case discussed in the previous section. Between these two regimes is
the Josephson regime, for which,

In this regime, the density imbalance between the two internal states go through small oscillations, similar to the
usual spatial Josephson eﬀect.

All three regimes are described by Eq.[27], which reduces to

at zero temperature.

As the dynamics conserves the magnitude of the spin we only have two dynamical variables, which can be taken as
angles (θ, φ) in the spherical polar coordinates representing the orientation of the spin. Another conserved quantity
in this dynamics is the Hamiltonian introduced earlier,

On the sphere deﬁned by (θ, φ), contours of constant

will deﬁne the paths along which the spin will precess. We

can write the Hamiltonian as a function of (θ, φ) as

and identify

At strong external ﬁelds the paths are almost circular with centers on the line oriented along vector ~V , passing
through the origin, as in the usual Rabi problem, and signiﬁcant changes in the populations occur throughout the
course of a Rabi oscillation. As a function of θ and φ the Hamiltonian has one maximum and one minimum, thus all
the trajectories circle these extremum points, if the external ﬁeld satisﬁes

When the intrinsic Rabi frequency

becomes the order of the density caused shifts

λn, We get into the
Josephson regime. Even on resonance, large population transfers from one state to another does not take place. This
can be easily seen from the structure of trajectories on the Bloch sphere. When the external ﬁeld does not satisfy
(43), instead of having one minimum and one maximum, the Hamiltonian has two maxima, one minimum and a
saddle point. The two constant H trajectories crossing at the saddle point separate the sphere into three regions,
giving us three kind of trajectories, circling around the minimum or one of the two maxima. None of these oscillations
however, result in large population transfers, which is in contrast with the Rabi problem, in which one can change
internal states of all the atoms with an arbitrarily small ﬁeld on resonance. Josephson eﬀect can be understood if
we realize that the transition frequency for an atom depends on the populations. So for weak ﬁelds even a small
population transfer carries the transition away from resonance, i.e. makes the eﬀective detuning much larger than
the Rabi frequency.

In the high ﬁeld case, for the external ﬁeld satisfying (43), the Hamiltonian will take values between Hmax and
Hmin, the values of the Hamiltonian at the maximum and minimum points. Any value of H in this range will uniquely
correspond to one trajectory and the period of motion on such a trajectory will be given by

where K is the complete elliptic integral [47], x1, x2 are the real roots, m is the real part and n is the absolute value
of the imaginary part of the remaining two complex conjugate roots of the polynomial in Eq.(45).

In the weak ﬁeld case there are 4 special values of the Hamiltonian, Hmin, the minimum value, Hsaddle the value
at the saddle point, Hmax1 and Hmax2, the smaller and the larger of the values at the two maxima respectively (See
Figure 1). For H values in the range Hmax2 > H ′ > Hmax1 or Hsaddle > H > Hmin there is again one to one
correspondence between H values and trajectories on the sphere. For such trajectories the frequencies are again given
by (47). For the values of H satisfying Hmax1 > H > Hsaddle there are two trajectories corresponding to each H, one
circling around Hmax1, and the other circling around Hmax2. However they both have the same period given by

We can see for λ11 = λ22 that our equations reduce to those obtained in [34,41] by using two coupled Gross-
Pitaevskii equations. At high ﬁeld we get almost circular trajectories, and correspondingly large oscillations between
internal levels of the condensate, as in the Rabi problem. For the low ﬁeld case we get three kind of trajectories all
of which give little population change, these correspond to Josephson oscillations. Two of these three kinds complete
a full cycle around the z axis, while the third is trapped in a region for which φmin < φ < φmax. Recalling that φ
represents the relative phase of the two condensates, we see that these trajectories correspond to Josephson oscillations
between the two internal states, caused by the weak link of the external ﬁeld. The other two kinds of trajectories
again correspond to Josephson oscillations, however in these class of Josephson oscillations there is a 2π phase slip
for every period of population change. such oscillations are called π Josephson oscillations [42].

It has been shown for the spatial Josephson eﬀect that the system can dynamically maintain a population imbalance
between the two macroscopically occupied states [42]. We can ask whether the internal Josephson eﬀect also shows
this “macroscopic quantum self trapping” eﬀect. This question is meaningful only if a symmetry exists between states
1 and 2

λ11 = λ22.

If the internal states have diﬀerent interactions a population imbalance is to be expected in any oscillation as the
system will be biased to choose the internal state with lower interaction energy.

If we take λ11 = λ22, our condition for the appearance of the extra maximum in the Hamiltonian becomes

,
A
|
|
as B = 0 in this case. One can immediately see that out of the three types of trajectories discussed for the general
case, those corresponding to π Josephson oscillations become macroscopically self trapped oscillations for λ11 = λ22.
It is remarkable that none of the arguments given for the internal Josephson eﬀect depend on the macroscopic

The behavior of the fully condensed and non-condensed cases are similar, however the values of the precession fre-
quencies and critical value of the external ﬁeld are diﬀerent. This diﬀerence, again, is a result of the fact that there
are no exchange scattering processes in a Bose condensate.

From the above discussion we come to the conclusion that to observe the internal Josephson eﬀect it is not required
to have two Bose condensed samples. Two words of caution should be voiced about this observation. First we have
only considered the coherent collisions and the coherence of the phase of two internal levels will be destroyed on a
time scale that is set by mean free time in the gas. Any observed internal Josephson oscillation in a non-condensed
sample should decay in this time scale. Second, to be able to see this eﬀect one has to go to very low ﬁeld strengths
such that the population oscillations should be observable in a non-condensed sample.

Still we have shown that it is not absolutely necessary to have Bose condensation to observe small oscillations in
the relative phase of the internal states under a small excitation ﬁeld. Let us imagine a non-condensed gas of atoms
put into a superposition of two internal states by a π/2 pulse. If this sample is further subjected to weak mixing
ﬁeld on resonance one would naively expect population transfer from one internal level to the other with the Rabi
frequency of the ﬁeld. However our discussion shows that if the sample and the ﬁeld satisfy

~V
snvT ≪ |
we would have small oscillations of the phase and populations, which is exactly what is observed in the internal
Josephson eﬀect with condensed samples.

VI. ABSORPTION RESONANCES FOR A PARTIALLY CONDENSED GAS: THE TWO SPIN PROBLEM

After analyzing the fully condensed and non-condensed Bose gas, both of which can be represented by only one spin
in our equations (27), we turn our attention to the partially condensed Bose gas. When the temperature is between
zero and condensation temperature, TBEC, there is both a condensed and a non-condensed density present. If these
densities are comparable we have to use the full form of Eq.(27), with both spins present.

We ﬁrst start with the free precession problem, i.e. by setting the external ﬁeld equal to zero. In this case we have

the equations

~Sc
~Bn + 2λ12 ~S
×
~S.
~Bc + 2λ12 ~Sc ×
The eﬀective magnetic ﬁelds ~Bn and ~Bc both point in the ˆz direction and are deﬁned in Eq.(28). As their time deriva-
tives are perpendicular to the spin vectors, norm of both of the spins,
are conserved. This conservation
simply means that the total number of atoms in the condensate and over the condensate are conserved. Another
conserved quantity can be obtained by adding Eq.(55) to Eq.(56) and taking the ˆz component. We have

Physically this conservation law corresponds to the fact that in the absence of a coupling ﬁeld the total number
of atoms in internal states 1 and 2 are conserved separately. Although these three conservation laws restrict the
resulting dynamics considerably, they still allow oscillations in which the density of condensed and non-condensed
atoms in internal state 1 change, while state two goes through the same oscillations out of phase with 1 to leave the
total number of condensed and non-condensed atoms constant. In our spin representation the degree of freedom that
expresses these oscillations will be Sz, or equivalently Sz

c as they add up to a constant.

The other conserved quantity is the Hamiltonian (29) which we choose to rewrite in terms of the conserved quantities

and the dynamical variable Sz as

The value of Sz will oscillate between x1 and x2 which are two roots of the polynomial inside the square root in
Eq.(61). For values of Sz in the interval x1 < Sz < x2, this polynomial takes positive values. When Sz reaches its
maximum or minimum value, the vectors ~S , ~Sc and ˆz are coplanar. This allows us to integrate Eq.(61) without
paying attention to the absolute value. We can express the period of Sz as an integral of the form in Eq.(45)

Here x3 < x4 are the remaining real root of the polynomial in equation of motion (61), which are assumed to be real.
In the case of imaginary x3 and x4, an analogue of Eq.(47) will give the expression for the period.

The second oscillation for free precession corresponds to the precession of total phase about the z axis. This pre-
cession is aﬀected by the population oscillations found above, and the oscillation frequency is not as easily calculated.
We can generally describe its motion as a sum of two components. One corresponding to a uniform precession around
the z axis with the density shift as in Eq(33), and the other corresponding to the eﬀect of an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld
in ˆz direction, caused by the population oscillations discussed above. The coupling between these two components is
y plane. Deﬁning S+ = Sx + iSy

We have seen that when Sz reaches its maximum or minimum values ~S and ~Sc are in the same vertical plane. We
can calculate exactly how much the spins have rotated around the z axis throughout the course of one Sz oscillation.
The eﬀect of Sz oscillations will present itself through the integral

which is again exactly calculable.

Instead of giving the resulting long expression for the rotation angle in one period, we choose to describe the motion
qualitatively. The precession of the two spins are aﬀected by the competition between two eﬀects. The ﬁrst eﬀect is,
due to the absence of exchange scattering in the condensate, the condensate spin ~Sc sees an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld
Bc diﬀerent from the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld seen by the normal gas spin ~S. The second, as discussed above, is the
condensate population oscillations characterized by Sz.

If there is not much diﬀerence between the densities of two internal states, both spins lie close to the x-y plane,
and their relative phase oscillates around zero, never growing large. However, if there is a lot of density diﬀerence
between two internal states, the spins are close to the ˆz axis. Over one period of Sz oscillation, the phase diﬀerence
can be a multiple of 2π.

We can investigate the precession easily in the limit when both of the spins are almost aligned with the ˆz axis. We

can write linear equations for the perpendicular components of the spins and get the two precession frequencies:

Where ˜ω satisﬁes,

with

ω = ˜ω + (w2 −

If the mixing angle is not small one would expect to see two diﬀerent frequencies in general. The average of the
two frequencies will be controlled by the average density shift seen by an atom in the sample, while the splitting will
reﬂect the average rate the condensate fraction of one of the internal states oscillates [33].

The appearance of a second frequency should be detectable in an experiment that probes a partially condensed Bose
gas in a superposition state. We propose using a partially condensed gas in a Ramsey separated ﬁeld arrangement,
as in the fountain atomic clocks [16,17]. In this case the appearance of a second frequency would present itself as a
beating in the Ramsey fringes. This beating however, will vanish both in the limit of full condensation and the limit
of a normal gas, and should be most prominent when the condensate fraction is close to a half. The exact values of
the frequencies can be obtained solving the equations of motion numerically.

Here we want to remind the reader that the equations used in this section Eq.(27) were derived for a uniform system.
If the particles are cold enough and the condensate is prepared in a shallow trap to make sure that the movement
of each part of the cloud is negligible in the center of mass coordinate frame during the time of measurement, the
equations will be locally correct and the experiment should show a density averaged result in the precession frequencies.
Otherwise the eﬀects of inhomogeneity must be included using the full transport equations Eq.(17,18).

When an external ﬁeld is turned on the ˆz component of total spin in not conserved anymore, there is a net population
is much
transfer from one internal state to the other. Much like the single spin case we have two limits. When
larger then the density shift λn we have both spins following almost circular trajectories around ~V . For the weak
ﬁeld case the system can be best described as two non–linear oscillators going through coupled oscillations with an
occasional two π phase slip for one of them. In this most general case precession frequencies can be found by numerical
integration of Eq.(27).

Finally to understand the eﬀect of statistics better we consider the same problem for a Fermi gas. We will have the

If we assume that only states 1 and 2 are coupled and all the oﬀ diagonal elements involving the other states are
equal to zero, we get a very simple dynamics. The time derivative of the diagonal elements do not depend on ρ while
the oﬀ diagonal element ρ12 changes according to

In the mean ﬁeld picture there are no coherent eﬀects of interactions for a transition between two states. The
exchange contributions to the precession frequency exactly cancel the direct contributions. For short–range potentials,
the exchange contribution to the energy has the same absolute value as the direct contribution. For Bosons the two
contributions add up, while for fermions they cancel.

The precession frequency for a free Fermi gas can be read oﬀ from Eq.(78)

This expression shows that the density dependent frequency shift encountered in the fountain atomic clocks can be
eliminated if a fermionic sample is used instead of a Bose gas. Any contributions to the frequency shift will be of
higher order in the diluteness parameter as/(n−1/3) of the gas. Finally we see that the behavior under an external
ﬁled is not at all diﬀerent from the usual Rabi precession. An analogue of internal Josephson eﬀect does not appear
in this case since the “energy” of the system Eq.(81) does not depend on the density at all (there are no quadratic
terms in the Hamiltonian in the spin representation).

VIII. CONCLUSION

We studied the eﬀect of external interactions on the internal dynamics of atoms in a dilute gas. For a Bose gas
we derived a general transport equation valid for any partially condensed and/or non-uniform gas. We then applied
it to the case of a homogeneous gas and investigated the eﬀects of interactions on the internal degrees of freedom.
As a ﬁrst result we obtained an expression for the density induced frequency shift in atomic clocks, for a gas which
is above BEC, or is at zero temperature. Furthermore we found that if a partially condensed sample is used in an
atomic clock, one would get two density dependent frequencies instead of one, due to the exchange of atoms between
the normal part and the condensed part of the gas.

We then went on to analyze the eﬀect of an external ﬁeld. We show how Rabi oscillations are replaced by internal
Josephson oscillations as the strength of the external ﬁeld is reduced. We calculated the frequencies of both oscillations
exactly. We have also found that an analogue of the internal Josephson eﬀect should be observable for a non-condensed
sample.

Finally we considered a Fermi gas, and derived the transport equation. We demonstrated that it is possible to
eliminate density shift in Rabi frequency by using a Fermi gas in an atomic clock and that no analogue of the internal
Josephson eﬀect is possible for a Fermi gas.

FIG. 1. The contour lines for the Hamiltonian Eq.(40), on the Bloch sphere, deﬁned by θ , φ, for weak external ﬁelds.
As the ﬁeld strength is increased, the saddle point comes closer to one of the maxima and they destroy each other when the
condition in Eq.(43) is satisﬁed, leaving just one maximum and one minimum. In the ﬁgure the trajectories encircling the
maxima correspond to Josephson oscillations with an average phase diﬀerence of π, while those encircling the minimum are
the usual Josephson oscillations corresponding to small oscillations of phase diﬀerence. The frequencies of motion along these
trajectories are given in ﬁg2.

FIG. 2.

The frequency of precession on the Bloch sphere as a function of the value the Hamiltonian Eq.(40) takes.
Hamiltonian can take values from Hmin to Hmax2. Near the saddle point the precession slows down logarithmically, as
expected from a two dimensional dynamics. Between Hsaddle and Hmax1 there are two trajectories for each value that the
Hamiltonian takes. However, they both have the same frequency Eq.(48).

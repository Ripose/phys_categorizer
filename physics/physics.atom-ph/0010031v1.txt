We discuss the ﬁnal stages of double ionization of atoms in a strong linearly polarized laser ﬁeld
within a classical model. We propose that all trajectories leading to non-sequential double ionization
pass close to a saddle in phase space which we identify and characterize. The saddle lies in a two
degree of freedom subspace of symmetrically escaping electrons. The distribution of longitudinal
momenta of ions as calculated within the subspace shows the double hump structure observed in
experiments.
Including a symmetric bending mode of the electrons allows us to reproduce the
transverse ion momenta. We discuss also a path to sequential ionization and show that it does not
lead to the observed momentum distributions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Present day lasers are powerful enough to ionize several
electrons from an atom. The electrons can be removed
one by one in a sequential process or all at once in a non-
sequential process. Independent electron models give ion-
ization rates that are much smaller than experimentally
observed [1], indicating that interactions between elec-
trons are important. A series of most recent experiments
has added the observation that also the ﬁnal state of
the electrons is dominated by the interactions: the to-
tal momentum of the electrons is aligned along the ﬁeld
axis [2–5] and the joint distribution of parallel momenta
for the two electrons, in the double ionization experi-
ment [5], has pronounced maxima along the diagonal,
showing that the electrons typically come with the same
momenta. These observations have been reproduced in
numerical simulations with varying approximations and
simplifying assumptions [6,7]. But given the complexity
of the analysis that is required the essential elements are
diﬃcult to identify. As a step towards a better under-
standing we discuss here the pathways to double ioniza-
tion within a classical model for electrons in a combined
Coulomb and external ﬁeld.

Our aim is not to describe the full ionization process
all the way from the ground state to the ﬁnal, multiply
ionized state. According to the currently accepted mod-
els [8–13,6,7], the whole process of multiphoton multiple
ionization can naturally be divided into two steps: in the
ﬁrst step a compound state of highly excited electrons
close to the nucleus is formed and in the second step sev-
eral electrons can escape from this compound state to
produce the multiply ionized ﬁnal state. We focus on the
last step, the escape of two or more electrons from the
highly excited compound state close to the nucleus.

The formation of the intermediate compound state is
suggested by the rescattering model [8,9] for strong ﬁeld
multiple ionization. According to this model the en-
hanced cross section for multiple ionization is due to a
rescattering of one electron that is temporarily ionized

and accelerated by the ﬁeld before it returns to the nu-
cleus when the ﬁeld reverses. During the collision energy
is transfered to other electrons, but all of this happens
close to the core, where the dynamics of the electrons is
fast and the interactions are strong and non-integrable.
As a consequence, details of the initial preparation pro-
cess are lost. Moreover, the decay of this state is also
quick. The compound state is thus a short lived, highly
unstable complex that separates the ﬁrst half of the ex-
citation process, whose main contribution is the build up
of energy in the complex, from the second half, where the
decay mode is determined.

The compound state has several decay paths: single
ionization when only one electron escapes to inﬁnity, dou-
ble or multiple ionization with two or more electrons es-
caping to inﬁnity, and the case of a single electron that es-
capes from the neighborhood of the nucleus but is rescat-
tered to the next ﬁeld reversal:
in the latter case the
whole process repeats itself, another compound state is
formed and the decay path has to be selected anew.

We discuss here the further evolution after the forma-
tion of the compound state. To be speciﬁc, we will focus
on the escape of two electrons in the following, but the
arguments can easily be extended to the removal of more
than two electrons. The main aim is to identify the chan-
nels that lead to double escape and to study their signa-
tures in the distribution of electron and ion momenta.
Our analysis is purely classical. Given the highly excited
complex from which we start and the multiphoton na-
ture of the process this seems a reasonable point of entry
to the ﬁnal stage of the ionization process. Our analysis
is very similar to Wanniers approach [14–16,18] to dou-
ble ionization by electron impact. The main diﬀerence
is that in the present case one has to take into account
also the external ﬁeld. Brief summaries of some aspects
of this model have been presented in [17].

The pathways to double ionization are discussed in sec-
tion 2. The dynamics in the C2v and Cv subspaces in-
cluding the eﬀective potential and sample trajectories is
discussed in section 3. A key element of our argument is

1

the identiﬁcation of a saddle in phase space near which
trajectories leading to non-sequential double ionization
have to pass; its properties and stability are discussed in
section 4. The distributions of electron momenta within
the C2v and Cv subspaces are analyzed in section 5. The
dynamics outside these symmetry spaces and sequential
ionization process are discussed in section 6. We conclude
with a summary of the model in section 7.

II. PATHWAYS TO DOUBLE IONIZATION

As described in the introduction we assume an ini-
tial state of two highly excited electrons near the nucleus
which then decays to either single ionization or double
ionization. During this process the linearly polarized
laser ﬁeld is always on. Therefore, the Hamiltonian con-
sists of three parts,

and the repulsion between the electrons,

.

(4)

The electric ﬁeld strength F (t) has an oscillatory com-
ponent times the envelope from the pulse; the discussion
applies to general F (t), and speciﬁc choices have to be
made for the numerical simulations only.

Once the electrons leave the atom the repulsion pushes
them apart and becomes weaker the larger the separa-
tion. Thus in the asymptotic state after ionization and
after the pulse is turned oﬀ, repulsion is minimized. In
order to identify the eﬀects of the electron repulsion on
the full process it is instructive to consider the double
ionization events without repulsion ﬁrst. This will be
presented in the next section. The pathways with elec-
tron repulsion included will be presented thereafter.

A. Without electron repulsion

The Hamiltonian for two electrons without electron re-
pulsion splits into two independent Hamiltonians for each
electron. In view of the fast motion of the electrons close
to the nucleus we will frequently use an adiabatic as-
sumption and discuss motion of the electrons in a ﬁeld

with ﬁxed amplitude F . Note, however, that all simula-
tions use the full time-dependent ﬁeld and do not make
use of this adiabatic assumption. With this assumption
each electron moves in a constant electric ﬁeld, one of the
few non-trivial integrable problems. The initial energy
and the other constants of motion of each electron are
ﬁxed by the initial conditions (in the compound state)
and do not change. Double ionization can thus occur
only if both electrons individually have enough energy
to ionize (and have the other constants of motion so as
to allow ionization). The threshold for ionization is set
by the ﬁeld strength:
if the ﬁeld is non-zero a Stark
saddle forms and the total energy has to be above the
Stark saddle. For a constant ﬁeld strength F the saddle
lies at |zF| = p2/|F| and has a potential energy (single
electron) VF = −2p2|F|. Therefore, double ionization
is excluded if the total energy for both electrons is less
than 2VF . For E = 2VF the only path leading to double
ionization has both electrons with the same energy. For
E > 2VF double ionization becomes possible even with
slight asymmetries in the energy distribution.

In the full system of two electrons without repulsion
but in a time-dependent ﬁeld integrability is lost but sep-
arability is still preserved. As discussed in the introduc-
tion the initial state is a compound state with negative
energy for each electron. If that energy is above the Stark
saddle and if the motion is directed towards it the elec-
trons can cross and run away from the nucleus. Once
they cross the saddle they have to gain energy to escape
from the Coulomb attraction when the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ.
This happens essentially by running down the potential
energy slope on the other side of the saddle while the ﬁeld
is still on. This mechanism of energy gain is the same as
in the interacting electron case.

B. With electron repulsion

With the electron repulsion included the common
Stark saddle at zF is no longer accessible since the elec-
trons cannot sit on top of each other. The best that can
be achieved is a symmetric arrangement of both elec-
trons in the same distance from the nucleus and sym-
metric with respect to the ﬁeld axis.
If the distances
are not the same, electron repulsion will push the elec-
tron that is further out away from the nucleus and thus
help towards ionization, but the one further in has to
face not only Coulomb attraction but also the repulsion
from the one further out. Thus repulsion acts so as to
amplify diﬀerences in energy in this conﬁguration. The
conﬁguration that is singled out is a symmetric one, with
both electrons moving at the same distance from the nu-
cleus. Deviations from this conﬁguration will be ampli-
ﬁed suﬃciently so that non-sequential double ionization
is suppressed and only single ionization takes place. A
remaining electron can, however, be still ionized if its en-
ergy is higher than the saddle energy for a single electron

2

atom and, in the adiabatic picture, the other constants of
motions allow to do so. In such sequential ionization cor-
relations between escaping electrons are strongly weak-
ened, that is the ﬁnal momenta of the electrons along the
polarization axis can be either parallel or anti-parallel.

Setting r = 0, pr = 0, z = 0 and pz = 0 we deﬁne the
Cv symmetry subspace. The Hamiltonian is then reduced

A two electron atom illuminated by a linearly polar-
ized electromagnetic wave possesses some symmetry sub-
spaces. The simplest C2v symmetric conﬁguration corre-
sponds to both electrons moving in a plane which con-
tains the ﬁeld polarization axis and with positions and
momenta symmetric with respect to this axis. The elec-
trons put in such a conﬁguration never leave it because
there is no force which can pull them out of the subspace.
The symmetry subspace can be enlarged. That is, with
additional bending motion of the electrons with respect
to the ﬁeld axis the symmetry subspace is Cv.

The symmetric conﬁgurations become more apparent
in suitably chosen coordinates. We apply the canonical
transformation

pR = pρ1 + pρ2
R = (ρ1 + ρ2)/2,
pr = pρ1 − pρ2
r = (ρ1 − ρ2)/2,
pZ = pz1 + pz2
Z = (z1 + z2)/2,
z = (z1 − z2)/2, pz = pz1 − pz2,
ϕ = ϕ1 + ϕ2, L = (pϕ1 + pϕ2)/2
φ = ϕ1 − ϕ2, pφ = (pϕ1 − pϕ2)/2

(5)

where (ρi, zi, ϕi) are cylindrical coordinates of the elec-
trons, labeled i = 1 and 2. For double ionization in lin-
early polarized laser ﬁeld the total angular momentum
projection on the polarization axis is conserved. The ex-
periments begin with atoms in the ground state, thus, for
the ﬁeld directed along the z-axis we may choose L = 0.

Let us begin with an analysis of the motion in the C2v
subspace. The electrons move in a plane and their posi-
tions (ρi = R, zi = Z) in that plane and their momenta
(pρi = pR/2, pzi = pZ /2) are the same.

The adiabatic potential (12) for ﬁxed time correspond-
ing to the maximal ﬁeld amplitude F = 0.137 a.u., i.e.
an intensity of 6.6 · 1014 W/cm2, is shown in Fig. 1a.
The saddle is located along the line ZS = rS cos θS and
RS = rS sin θS with θS = π/6 or 5π/6 and at a distance

r2

S = √3/|F (t)| .

The energy of the saddle is

VS = −6q|F (t)|/√3 .

(13)

(14)

For the above mentioned ﬁeld the saddle has an energy
of VS = −1.69 a.u..
If we switch oﬀ the repulsion between the electrons the
saddle will move onto the Z-axis, i.e. both electrons are
allowed to escape symmetrically on top of each other.
Slow switching on the repulsion results in a change of
the positions of the saddles experienced by each elec-
tron. The repulsion separates the saddles which ﬁnally
are situated at some distance from the Z-axis.

A typical trajectory within the symmetric conﬁgura-
tion for ω = 0.057 a.u.
(800 nm) is shown in Fig. 2.
During the ramping of the ﬁeld the electronic motion is
little inﬂuenced by the electric ﬁeld, but during the third
half cycle of the ﬁeld the saddle is close enough to the
electron orbits and ionization takes place. Once on the
other side of the saddle, the electrons rapidly gain en-
ergy. The saddle thus provides a kind of transition state
[19,20] for the correlated double ionization process: once
the electrons cross it, they are accelerated by the ﬁeld
and pulled further away, making a return rather unlikely.
Moreover, the electrons can acquire the missing energy so
that both can escape to inﬁnity even when the ﬁeld van-
ishes. Note that before the double ionization occurs the
eﬀect of the ﬁeld on the electrons is minimal, supporting
the adiabatic assumption.

In the experiments [2–5] ion momenta both parallel
and transverse to the ﬁeld are measured. For ω =
0.057 a.u. momentum transfer by photons is negligible,
so the ion momentum reﬂects the sum of the momenta of
the emitted electrons, p1 + p2 = −pion. Symmetric mo-
tion in the C2v subspace takes place in a plane and conse-
quently the total transverse momentum of the electrons

is zero. In the Cv subspace the electrons are permitted to
leave the plane, and this is a minimal extension to allow
ions to have non-vanishing ﬁnal transverse momenta.

space with E = −1.3 a.u., F = 0.137 a.u. and the pulse
duration Td = 4 × 2π/ω. Panel (a) distance of the electrons
to the nucleus. The dashed line indicates the distance of the
saddle. Note that before the double ionization occurs the ef-
fect of the ﬁeld on the electrons is minimal, supporting the
adiabatic assumption. Panel (b) energy of the electrons. Note
that the initial state has negative total energy and cannot lead
to double ionization. The energy increases once the electrons
have escaped from the nucleus far enough so that acceleration
by the electric ﬁeld dominates.

The sections through equipotential surfaces of Eq. (10)
for φ = π and φ = π/4 are shown in Fig. 1. Increasing or
decreasing φ from π results in greater repulsion energy
between the electrons. So the electrons can escape, with
the coordinate φ 6= π, only if the energy is greater than
the saddle energy, Eq. (14).
We discuss here double ionization of atoms but the
analysis of a symmetric escape can be easily extended to
a multiple ionization process [17]. Especially for N elec-
trons the symmetric subspace corresponding to N parti-
cles symmetrically distributed in the plane perpendicular
to the polarization axis is CN v. The analysis of the mul-
tiple ionization will be published elsewhere.

IV. THE SADDLE

Within the adiabatic assumption and for a ﬁxed exter-
nal ﬁeld strength non-sequential double ionization hinges
on the crossing of the saddle in the C2v subspace. For
the dynamics within the subspace this is obvious from the
potential. For the motion in the full six-dimensional con-
ﬁguration space this is less clear. One possibility to gain
insight locally near the saddle is a harmonic analysis and
a determination of the frequencies of small deviations.
Within the C2v symmetric subspace there is one hyper-
bolic mode corresponding to motion across the saddle
(the ’reaction coordinate’, in chemical physics parlance

4

[19,20]) and a stable one to perpendicular variations. In
the full space we expect at least one additional unstable
one, corresponding to the ampliﬁcation of energy diﬀer-
ences mentioned before in section (IIB). The analysis in
this section is for ﬁxed ﬁeld strength, for electron dynam-
ics in a constant external ﬁeld, justiﬁed by the adiabatic
reasoning.

The second order variations of the potential (7) around

the saddle point results in

with the maximal ﬁeld strength of F = 0.137 a.u. we
ﬁnd 1/µ = 1.8 a.u. and 1/ν = 1.4 a.u.. Compared to the
period of the laser, 2π/ω = 110.2 a.u. this is rather fast,
indicating that the crossing of the saddle and the separa-
tion away from the double ionization manifold take place
rather quickly. This justiﬁes also our adiabatic analysis
in this section.

So far we have discussed the phase space features in an
adiabatic approximation for ﬁxed ﬁeld strengths. Now
we will use this to draw conclusions about the experi-
mentally observed signatures, speciﬁcally about the dis-
tributions of ion momenta in the ﬁnal state. This can be
calculated within the Cv subspace by averaging over all
initial conditions and all phases of the ﬁeld.

A. Parameters of the model

The rescattering of an electron leads to a highly excited
complex of total energy E which is one of the parame-
ters of our model. The maximal energy a rescattering
electron can bring in has been estimated to be about
3.17Up [8,9], where Up is the ponderomotive energy of an
electron. For the weakest ﬁeld used in the experiment
on double ionization of He atoms [2] this maximal en-
ergy barely corresponds to the ionization energy of the
He1+ ions. We therefore assume in the following that
the highly excited complex has a negative initial energy,
E < 0.

The absence of detailed knowledge of the structure of
the initial compound nucleus suggests to average over the
initial conﬁgurations. However, even for a negative en-
ergy and ﬁxed time it is diﬃcult to deﬁne a microcanon-
ical distribution of initial conditions for the Hamiltonian
(9) since, for non-zero external ﬁeld, the system is open.
Therefore, we choose for the calculations initial condi-
tions from the energy shell that also lie in the hypersur-
face Z = 0. The results are not sensitive to a particular
choice of the hypersurface but the one for Z = 0 has the
advantage that the dipole moment along the ﬁled is zero
and the choice of the initial conditions does not depend
on the initial ﬁeld phase.

The second parameter, in addition to the energy, is the
time t0 during the pulse Eq. (8) when the highly excited
complex is formed. The rescattering event is not possible
at the beginning of the pulse, so one has to start simula-
tions somewhere in the middle of the pulse. In Fig. 3 and
4 ﬁnal distributions of ion momenta for the initial energy
E = −0.1 a.u., ﬁeld strength F = 0.137 a.u. and dif-
ferent initial time t0 are shown. The distributions of the
transverse momenta are almost the same but the ones for

The φ-degree of freedom corresponds to a bending mo-
tion of the electrons against each other and is stable on
account of the repulsive nature of the Coulomb force.
This degree of freedom is also the one that comes in by
going from the C2v subspace to the Cv subspace.

Diagonalization in the (R − RS, Z − ZS) space reveals
one stable and one unstable mode. The latter corre-
sponds to the reaction coordinate and its Lyapunov expo-
nent is µ ≈ 2.43F 3/4. Similar analysis in the (r, z) space
yields another stable and unstable mode with Lyapunov
exponent ν ≈ 3.14F 3/4. The direction of the unstable
mode is (wr, wz) ≈ (0.43w, w) and it corresponds to the
situation when one electron escapes and the other one is
turned back to the nucleus. That is, with positive and in-
creasing w the ﬁrst electron moves away from the nucleus,
i.e. ρ1 = RS + wr and z1 = ZS + wz grow [see (5)], while
the other one returns to the nucleus, i.e. ρ1 = RS − wr
and z1 = ZS − wz decrease.
All in all there are three stable modes and two un-
stable ones. Any energy contained in the stable modes
is preserved and cannot be transferred to kinetic energy
along the reaction coordinates. Whether single or dou-
ble ionization occurs is thus determined solely by the
energy and initial conditions in the two hyperbolic sub-
spaces. For energy equal to the saddle energy only a
trajectory within the C2v symmetry subspace leads to
non-sequential escape – any deviation from the subspace
are growing faster than the escape along the reaction co-
ordinate since ν > µ. For energy higher than the saddle
some deviations from the symmetry subspace are allowed.
In particular, following Wanniers lead and Rosts gener-
alization [14–16,18] it is possible to estimate the critical
behavior for the double ionization cross section at thresh-
old. It is algebraic with the exponent given by the ratio of
the positive Lyapunov exponents of the unstable modes.
A detailed discussion of this is outside the main line of
our arguments here and will be given elsewhere.

It is instructive to actually calculate numbers for the
Lyapunov exponents in the two directions. For lasers

hump structure with widths sensitive to the initial time.

of the parallel momentum distribution can be estimated as

The maximum energy that can be acquired by a free
electron in the ﬁeld is 2Up. So, for parallel emission of
two electrons, the maximal parallel ion momentum can
be estimated as

ppar = 2p4Up = 2F f (t)/ω.

If we substitute in Eq. (16) t = t0 we ﬁnd values which
correspond very well to the widths of the distributions in
Fig. 3 and 4. The ﬁgures indicate also that the widths
are the same independently if t0 is chosen before or after
the peak of the pulse provided f (t0) is the same. This
implies that the dominant ionizations take place in the
ﬁrst ﬁeld cycle after the complex is formed. Fitting the
width of the calculated distribution to the experimental
results allows one to estimate the moment in the pulse
when majority of doubly ionized ions are created.

Now we ﬁx t0 and change the initial energy E; the
results are shown in Fig. 5. For the lowest energy,
E = −1.5 a.u., the transverse momentum distribution
is narrower than for higher energies. E = −1.5 a.u.
is
actually very close to the minimal saddle energy for the
applied ﬁeld, VS = −1.69 a.u.. Thus the eﬀect is natural
as, close to the saddle energy, only trajectories near the
C2v subspace can cross the saddle and those with φ 6= π
bounce back from the potential barrier and do not ionize.
While the width of the distributions of the parallel
momenta do not change signiﬁcantly their shapes do, es-
pecially for the initial energy close to the saddle. The
electrons that cross the saddle when the energy is near
VS are slow and the combined interactions of the external
and Coulomb ﬁelds shapes the distributions. This is dif-
ferent from the high energy case: then shortly after the
electrons cross the saddle the interaction with the elec-
tric ﬁeld is stronger than the attraction to the nucleus
and the distribution is mostly shaped by the laser ﬁeld.
The initial energy of the complex is the higher the
higher intensity of the laser is and the larger the energy a
rescattered electron can bring in [8,9]. From the depen-

dence of the distributions on the initial energy we may
conclude that in the experiment the shape of the distri-
bution of the parallel ion momenta should change char-
acter when the laser intensity increases. For the intensity
at the threshold for non-sequential double ionization the
distribution with single maximum around zero momen-
tum is expected; for higher intensities the double hump
structure should turn up.

sults for the C2v subspace for parallel momentum dis-
tributions are essentially the same. The transverse mo-
menta of ions for the C2v subspace are, however, zero
because of the symmetry assumption.

After this discussion of the two parameters (initial en-
ergy and starting time of the integration) we can turn to
comparisons with experimental observations.

B. Comparison with experimental results

Weber et al. [2] carried out double ionization exper-
iments with He atoms and measured the distributions
of ion momenta. They applied infrared (800 nm) laser
pulses of the duration 220 fs (measured on the half
peak value) and with the peak intensities in the range
(2.9 − 6.6) × 1014 W/cm2. In Fig. 6 and 7 we show the
experimental distributions and compare with those cal-
culated in the Cv subspace. The agreement is remarkable
except for the parallel momentum distribution in Fig. 7
where the calculated distribution possesses a much more
pronounced minimum than in the experiment and the
positions of the peaks do not exactly coincide with the
experimental values.

FIG. 8. Panels (a)-(b): ﬁnal ion momentum distributions
measured in the experiment of double ionization of Ne atoms
in the focus of 795 nm, 30 fs (i.e. about 11 × 2π/ω) laser
pulses at peak intensity of 13 × 1014 W/cm2 (i.e.
for the
ﬁeld strength F = 0.192 a.u.) from [4]. Panels (c)-(d): the
corresponding distributions calculated in the Cv symmetry
subspace for the initial energy E = −0.3 a.u. and t0 = 0.4Td
where Td/2 = 11 × 2π/ω, see Eq. 8.

There are a few possible sources for these discrepancies.
First, the pulse duration in the experiment was about 8
times longer than in the simulations. The slow ramp-
ing of the ﬁeld in the experiment implies that the initial
time t0 of the ionization is less well deﬁned, i.e. there are
contributions from some range of t0. There are also con-
tributions from diﬀerent initial energies. Secondly, real
ionizing trajectories do not live exactly in the symmetry

subspace but close to it, leading to asymmetries and ad-
ditional diﬀerences in the ﬁnal momenta. And there are
also possible contributions from sequential double ioniza-
tion events (see below).

Moshammer et al. [4] performed experiments with Ne
atoms for much shorter pulses, i.e. 30 fs and for radiation
with similar wave length (795 nm) as the previous group.
The comparison of our calculations with this experiment
are presented in Fig. 8. Interactions of the two excited
electrons with the other electrons are neglected in our
model and the energy values used in the calculations are
measured with respect to the threshold for the two elec-
tron continuum (i.e. about 2.3 a.u.). The agreement is
even better than for the case of He atoms. This is pre-
sumably due to the much shorter pulse duration and the
fasted ramping of the ﬁeld, so that the time t0 when the
majority of the ionization events happen is much better
deﬁned.

VI. SEQUENTIAL DOUBLE IONIZATION

Already from the experiment it is clear that double
ionization is a rare process, e.g. outnumbered by single

8

ionization by about 104 : 1 for He atoms and ﬁeld inten-
sity 2.9 · 1014 W/cm2 [2]. Hence arbitrarily chosen ini-
tial conditions in the full space will typically not lead to
double ionization and numerical simulations of the whole
process are rather unattainable.

We have discussed the non-sequential double escape
of the electrons considering trajectories within the sym-
metry subspace. Motion in the symmetry subspace is
unstable, that is deviations from the subspace will be
ampliﬁed leading to single rather than double ionization.
We can illustrate this with trajectories started slightly
outside the symmetry plane (Fig. 9). Fig 9a shows ini-
tial conditions on the saddle and symmetrically escaping
electrons. For some deviation from symmetry, one elec-
tron escapes, the other remains trapped to the nucleus
(Fig. 9b).

It is possible, however, that the second electron returns
to the nucleus but picks up enough energy to ionize itself
(Fig. 9c). In the adiabatic picture, if the energy of the
remaining electron is higher than the saddle for a sin-
gle electron atom, VF = −2p2|F|, whether the electron
stays trapped or escapes depends on the other constants
of motion (besides the energy) in this integrable system.
The second electron can thus escape during the same half
ﬁeld cycle as the ﬁrst one but its ﬁnal parallel momen-
tum component need not be related to that of the ﬁrst
electron, as is shown in Fig. 9c.

FIG. 10. Final parallel ion momenta distributions calcu-
lated in the two-dimensional non-interacting electrons model
for the initial time t0 = 0.33Td in the pulse duration, where
Td = 20 × 2π/ω, peak ﬁeld amplitude F = 0.137 a.u. and
initial energy E = −0.8 a.u.
[panel (a)] and E = −0.1 a.u.
[panel (b)]. The initial conditions for the electrons have been
chosen to satisfy E = E1 + E2 with the restrictions E1 < 0
and E2 < 0. The saddle energy for a single electron is
VF = −1.05 a.u.. The results in each panel are based on
about 1.5 · 106 trajectories.

We are not able to calculate the contribution of sequen-
tial events to the double ionization process but we can
estimate the distribution of the ﬁnal ion momenta if the
sequential process were dominant. To simulate sequen-
tial escape one may return to a non-interacting electron
model, essentially since the electrons cross the barrier at
diﬀerent times.
In the model the initial conditions for
each electron are chosen independently, constraint only
by the requirement that the total initial energy is ﬁxed

E = E1 + E2 and that E1 < 0 and E1 < 0. Simulta-
neous double ionization are not explicitly excluded, but
events with delayed ionization are more probable, so that
the distributions can still reﬂect the contributions from
sequential ionization.

In Fig. 10 the distributions of parallel ion momenta
for E = −0.8 a.u. and E = −0.1 a.u., calculated in the
non-interacting electrons model for F = 0.137 a.u, are
plotted. The ﬁgure should be compared with the ﬁgures
from the previous section. The conclusion is straightfor-
ward: the non-interacting electrons model is not able to
reproduce correlations between the electrons observed in
the experiments. Moreover, sequential escape can not be
a dominant mechanism for double ionization in the range
of the ﬁeld intensities considered here.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered the process of double ionization
of atoms in a strong, linearly polarized ﬁeld for inten-
sities below the saturation of single electron ionization.
We have developed a model for non-sequential double
ionization within classical mechanics. The process has
been divided into two stages:
in the ﬁrst one a rescat-
tering process leads to a highly excited complex of two
electrons. In the second stage, an ionization of such com-
pound state takes place. We have focused on the latter
stage considering diﬀerent pathways to double escape of
the electrons.

The excited complex can doubly ionize even when its
energy is negative because the external ﬁeld opens up
saddles for electron escape. The pathway favored by
the Coulomb interactions and the ﬁeld is simultaneous
symmetric escape of both electrons. Deviations form the
symmetric conﬁgurations are ampliﬁed by the repulsion
between the electrons which pulls one electron to inﬁnity
but the other one is pushed back to the nucleus. There-
fore we propose that non-sequential double ionization is
dominated by motions of electrons in or near the sym-
metric subspace with the saddle.

The requirement of the symmetric motion greatly sim-
pliﬁes the analysis which then can be carried out for the
three- or even two-dimensional eﬀective potential. The
trajectory simulations within the symmetric conﬁgura-
tions turns out to reproduce the experimentally observed
ion momenta distributions very well. We have also con-
sidered an alternative mechanism of the ionization, i.e.
sequential escape of the electrons. By means of the non-
interacting electrons model we show that the sequential
ionization is not able to explain the experimentally ob-
served electrons correlations.

The modeling of the experimental distributions re-
quires information on two parameters, the initial energy
and the time of formation, which reﬂect a lack of knowl-
edge on the compound state and the ramping of the ﬁeld.
The dependence of the momentum distributions on the

parameters and comparison with the experimental results
give insights into the dynamics of double ionization.

The analysis in the present paper has been restricted
to double ionization but its extension to multiple escape
is straightforward and will be given elsewhere. In its cur-
rent form the model is applicable for linearly polarized
ﬁelds only. For other polarizations the number of rescat-
tering events is greatly reduced. However, for some el-
liptically polarized ﬁeld, if an electron is driven back to
the core and a highly excited complex is formed, in the
adiabatic approximation the symmetric conﬁguration of
the electrons can be deﬁned with respect to the tempo-
rary electric ﬁeld axis. Then one can proceed with the
analysis as for the linearly polarized case.

Our whole discussion has a more than superﬁcial sim-
ilarity with Wanniers analysis of double ionization by
electron impact [14–16]. The main diﬀerences are the
presence of a ﬁeld and its time dependence, which en-
larges phase space and complicates the identiﬁcation of
the transition state. In the adiabatic approximation at
ﬁxed ﬁeld strength we could identify this saddle in the
C2v subspace. The comparison with experiments is com-
plicated furthermore by the necessity to average over
initial energy and time of preparation of the compound
state. Thus, signatures one might attribute to Wanniers
analysis, such as threshold exponents (they follow imme-
diately from the stability analysis of the saddle, but are
not easy to verify), will be even more diﬃcult to study.
But we have no doubt that the observation of the corre-
lated escape of the electrons [5] is a clear signature of the
existence and dominance of the saddle and the pathways
to double ionization which we discuss here.

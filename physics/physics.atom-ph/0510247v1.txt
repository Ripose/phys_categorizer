Abstract

The limit relations for the partial derivatives of the two-electron atomic wave functions at the two-

particle coalescence lines have been obtained numerically using accurate CFHHM wave functions.

The asymptotic solutions of the proper two-electron Schr¨odinger equation have been derived for

both electron-nucleus and electron-electron coalescence.

It is shown that the solutions for the

electron-nucleus coalescence correspond to the ground and singly excited bound states, including

triplet ones. The proper solutions at small distances R from the triple coalescence point were

presented as the second order expansion on R and ln R. The vanishing of the Fock’s logarithmic

terms at the electron-nucleus coalescence line was revealed in the frame of this expansion, unlike

the case of electron-electron coalescence. On the basis of the obtained boundary solutions the

approximate wave function corresponding to both coalescence lines have been proposed in the

two-exponential form with no variational parameters.

INTRODUCTION

Two-electron systems present an excellent basis both for testing the new quantum cal-

culational approaches to many-body systems and for studying a number of photo-electron

and other atomic processes. This is because such systems are the simplest ones with enough

complexity to contain the main features of a many-body theory. This complexity arises

from the electron-electron Coulomb potential which depends on the interelectronic distance

It does not depend on any experimental constants whose values change considerably with

It has been established [1] that relativistic and quantum-electrodynamic corrections to the

energy levels of an atomic or molecular system require highly accurate nonrelativistic wave

functions. Rayleigh-Ritz variational calculations provide a wave function with relative error

approximately proportional to the square root of the relative error in the energy. Therefore,

if the energies are used to estimate the quality of the wave functions, then it is necessary

to calculate the nonrelativistic energies to far greater accuracy than would otherwise be

The alternative way for obtaining the very accurate and locally correct wave functions is

a direct solution of the three-body Schr¨odinger equation. The Correlation Function Hyper-

spherical Harmonic Method (CFHHM), employed in this paper, realizes successfully this way

of solution [2]. Accuracy of the method is comparable to the most sophisticated variational

For problems in atomic or molecular physics, eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (1) exhibit

singular behaviour at those points in conﬁguration space where two or more charged particles

come together and the resulting potential becomes inﬁnite. For systems with zero total

orbital momentum (S-states) the wave function depends only on three scalar variables r1,

r2 and r12, i. e., Ψ

The conditions (2) and (3) pertain to the situation when the coordinates of one of the

electrons and the nucleus coinside. These conditions are valid for the electrons, which have

the same (triplet states) or the opposite (singlet states) spin directions. The condition (4)

deals with coincidence of coordinates of two electrons. It is valid only for the singlet states,

while due to the Pauli exclusion principle Ψ(R, R, 0) = 0 for the triplet states. The inclusion

of functions with such cusps into trial wave functions has been shown to improve dramatically

the rates of convergence of Rayleigh-Ritz variational calculations [4]. The using of the proper

correlation function, which obey the Kato conditions (2)-(4), accelerates considerably the

convergence of CFHHM [2] approach, as well.

It is known that the cusp conditions (2)-(4) are consequences of the Coulomb singularity in

the potential and provide speciﬁc relations between the wave function and its ﬁrst derivative

at the points of coalescence. It was shown in Ref.

[5] that the coalescence behaviour also

uniquely determines the third derivative of the spherically averaged wave function in terms

of the lower derivatives. The deduced relations are valid for any atom, molecule, or electron

gas in any smooth external ﬁeld.

There are also singularities involving more than two particle, such as the triple-coincidence

singularity in the Helium atom, when both electrons simultaneously approach the nucleus. A

formal expansion in powers of the hyperradius r =

1 + r2
r2

2 and its logarithm ln r about this

singular point was proposed by Fock [6] for the S-state wave functions of the Helium atom.

Subsequently, much eﬀorts has been devoted to understanding this expansion. The O(r0),

O(r1) , and O(r2 ln r) terms in Fock’s expansion are easy to obtain analytically. The O(r2)

term in the expansion has been obtained in closed form by Maslen and co-workers, through

the extensive use of computer algebra [7, 8]. Myers and co-authors [9] have examined their

results, and have veriﬁed that the inclusion of this term in the expansion yields a continuous

”local” energy, whereas the ”local” energy is ﬁnite but discontinuous at r = 0 if the term

is omitted. Forrey [10] performed variational calculations of the ground-state energy of

Helium. His basis set included an explicit treatment of the Fock expansion in hyperspherical

coordinates and extra products of Laguerre polynomials in perimetric coordinates. This work

has demonstrated that the use of Fock basis functions provided a substantial improvement

in the convergence rate.

We would like to emphasize that the calculation of the accurate wave function at the

coalescence lines is a very diﬃcult problem just because of their cusp nature. On the

other hand, a number of atomic physics problems could be solved by using the functions

appearing on the RHS of Eqs. (2)-(4). The processes of photoionization in the Helium atom

and heliumlike ions [11] could serve as an example.

It is well-known (see, e. g.,[7, 8, 9]), that using Hamiltonian (1) we can present the

Schr¨odinger equation for S-states of two-electron atom/ions in the form

In this paper we provide the accurate analytic solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation (5) at

the coalescence lines for both small and very large R. The Kato cusp conditions (2)-(4) are

employed to solve the problem.

II. ELECTRON-NUCLEUS COALESCENCE

To investigate the case of coalescence of one electron and the nucleus in two-electron

atom/ions, one should ﬁnd the limit as, e.g., r2 approaches zero for both sides of Eq. (5). It

is easier to perform this mathematical operation with the help of following relations:

where θ1 is the angle between the vectors r1 and r12, and θ2 is the angle between r2 and r12

(see Fig. 1). It is clear that:

We could certainly obtain the same equation if took the limit as r1 approaches zero (r2 =

r12 = R).

It is seen that the LHS of Eq. (9) presents a sum of the form

for the partial derivatives of Ψ taken at the electron-nucleus coalescence line, we have

(k = 1, 2;

l, m = 0, 1, 2, 12).

(10)

Here ∂r0 = 1. Then, in the case of the ﬁrst partial derivatives we have k = 1, whereas one

of the numbers l, m is equal to zero.

Let us now denote the two-electron wave S-function at the electron-nucleus coalescence

line as

Ψ(R, 0, R)

F (R).

≡

(11)

So, if we could express all of the functions Λ(k)
l,m(R) through the functions F (R), F ′(R) and
F ′′(R), with factors being depending on R, then we obtain an ordinary diﬀerential equation

of the second order for the function F (R). The prime denotes diﬀerentiation, as usual.

Solution of this diﬀerential equation under the proper boundary conditions could give us

the desired function F (R). We do not yet know how to do this in general form. However,

as a ﬁrst but important step we propose here a method for solving Eq. (9) in the boundary

regions, i.e., at very large R and at small R. One should notice that the numerical calculation

of F (R) in these regions is particularly diﬃcult.

The direct Correlation Function Hyperspherical Harmonic Method allows to calculate

numerically the two-electron wave function Ψ(r1,r2,r12), as well as its special case F (R),

with very large accuracy. By using the CFHHM numerical calculations we obtained the

following limit relations between the functions mentioned above for the asymptotic region

of very large R:

= 0.

The calculations show that these relationships are valid at least to four signiﬁcant digits. We

cannot achieve higher accuracy due to the fact that the inaccuracies of the wave functions

and especially of their derivatives go up with R. Note that the asymptotic relations (12)-(17)

are valid for the ground states of the two-electron atom/ions, as well as for its excited states,

including triplet states. Of course, we were not able to perform the proper calculations for

all of the excited states. However, we could guarantee the validity of Eqs. (12)-(17) for

several ﬁrst ones.

Relations (15)-(17) show that we can neglect the partial derivatives with respect to r12.

Moreover, the calculations of the accurate CFHHM wave functions show that the ratio of
F ′(R)/F (R) achieves a ﬁnite value as R approaches inﬁnity. In the next sections we will

obtain this ratio as a ﬁnite function of Z and E. This property together with the limit

relation (12) allows us to neglect the terms proportional to 1/R on both sides of Eq. (9).

And ﬁnally, using the relations (13), (14), Eq. (9) is transformed into the following simple

diﬀerential equation:

d2Fas(R)

dR2 + (2E + Z 2)Fas(R) = 0.

, has the form

The function Fas(R) is the asymptotic representation (for very large R) of the accurate two-

(cid:17)

electron wave function in the situation when one of the electrons ”seats” on the nucleus,

while the other electron is far away. Eq. (12) shows that this function depends on two

parameters, the nuclear charge Z and the total energy E of the two-electron atomic system.

C1 is an arbitrary constant. We used only the accurate wave functions of the discrete

spectrum (E < 0) to obtain the relations (12)-(17). The condition of exponent in Eq. (19)

to be real leads to the inequality

It is easy to conclude that Eq. (20) corresponds to the ﬁrst ionization threshold I1 = Z 2/2,

and that the limit relations (12)-(17) describe the ground and singly excited bound states

[12,13]. So, if the electrons are far away from each other (R

), then the simplest model

one may think of is the model of two independent electrons. The inner electron is bound in

a state with principal quantum number N and energy EN =

Z 2/(2N 2), the outer electron

is in a hydrogen-like orbital with energy En =

We have obtained some limit relations for the functions (10) and (11) in the vicinity of

the triple collision point, R = 0, as well. The proper numerical calculations yield for the

point are non-zero. Therefore, Eqs. (21), (22) allows to avoid the divergence at R = 0 for
terms proportional to R−1 in Eq. (9). The triplet states, which are proportional to R2 in

the vicinity of the triple collision point, don’t have to obey such a requirement.

We were able to obtain only the simplest limit relations as R approaches zero. We hope

these relations could be good for searching the general solution of Eq. (9). However, to

derive the solution for small R we propose another way, which is more precise as well as

more reliable. As was mentioned earlier, in Refs.[7, 8] analytic expansions of the three-body

atomic wavefunctions were presented. The expansions were derived for the exact solutions

of the Schr¨odinger equation (5) up to the terms of the order r2 (including r2 ln r). Note that

limit relations (21)-(27) (R

0) could be obtained by using Ref. [8] too. We used some

→

of those results (see Ref. [8], pp. 2796-2797) to obtain the analytical representation of the

two-electron wave functions at the two-particle coalescence lines in the vicinity of the triple

coincidence point. The same results, but for the singlet states only, could be derived by

using Ref. [9]. However, one should be very careful, because in the last reference we found

at least three misprints, which could have inﬂuence on the ﬁnal results. The ﬁrst misprint

9

(28)

(29)

is a missing factor 2 in the expression for Y2,0 (below Eq. (14) [9]). The second one is the

incorrect expression r12 sin α cos θ on the RHS of the expression for Y2,1 (below Eq. (14) [9]).
And the third misprint is the missing function cos−1 before (r1 ·

So, using the results of Refs. [8,9] and taking the limit as r2 →

For simplicity, the wave functions (28), (29) are normalized by condition F (0) = 1 for the
singlet states, and [F (R)/R2]R=0 = 1 for the triplet states.

We would like to pay particular attention to the absence of the Fock’s logarithmic term

in both expressions. This term disappears at the electron-nucleus coalescence line, because

of the vanishing Fock’s angular coeﬃcient ψ21 in the limit as r2 approaches zero (whereas
r1 →

r12) for the singlet states.

At ﬁrst glance, it is natural to assume that all of the Fock’s logarithmic terms are canceled

at the electron-nucleus coalescence line. However, such an assumption proved to be incorrect.

We veriﬁed the angular coeﬃcients ψ31, ψ41 and ψ42, corresponding to the logarithmic terms
in the Fock’s expansion up to the terms of order r4, r4 ln2 r (singlet states). The exact

expressions for these quantities could be found, e.g., in Ref. [7]. All of these three angular

coeﬃcients proved to be nonzero. So, we conclude that the ﬁrst logarithmic term ψ21r2 ln r

of the Fock’s expansion is the only one to vanish at the electron-nucleus coalescence line,

at least for the singlet states. Eq. (29) shows additionally that for the triplet states all
of the logarithmic terms, up to the fourth order in r, are canceled in the limit as r2 →
0
0). Accordingly, the values of the ﬁrst and second derivatives F ′(0), F ′′(0) for
(or r1 →

the singlet states and [F (R)/R2]
R=0 for the triplet states are ﬁnite. We
veriﬁed the validity of the expansions (28), (29) by direct calculation of these derivatives

in the limit as R

0, using the accurate Ψ-functions. The results coincided with the

calculations performed according to the analytical formulas (28), (29) within the accuracy

of ﬁve signiﬁcant digits.

the accurate two-electron atomic wave function for the case of two electrons being at the

same point but far away from the nucleus. Unlike Fas, Eq. (39) shows that Φas depends on

only one parameter, energy E. As far as we consider the discrete spectrum, then E < 0 and

consequently the exponent on the RHS of Eq. (39) is negative.

Moreover, we obtained the following relation in the limit as R

It enables one to avoid the divergence at R = 0 for the terms that are proportional to R−1

in the general Eq. (32) for the case, when two electrons are at the same point.

The approximate solution of the Eq. (32) at small R may now be obtained by neglecting
the terms that are not proportional to R−1 in that equation. Using also Eq. (33), we have

upon the nuclear charge Z. Note that using the proper formulas from Refs. [8,9] yields the

erroneous term Z 2 instead of the correct result (5/3)Z 2 in the expression (43). As we can

see, the Fock’s logarithmic term is preserved at the electron-electron coalescence line, unlike
the case of the electron-nucleus line. Hence, the second derivative Φ′′(R) has a logarithmic

singularity at the origin. It is seen that solutions (42) and (43) coincide in the ﬁrst order

approximation at small R.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In Sections II, III we have obtained analytical representations of the accurate two-electron

wave functions at the boundary regions of both two-particle coalescence lines. We found

that the behaviour of these boundary solutions both at small and at large distances R has

an exponential character. These properties enable us to propose a simple approximate rep-

resentation for the ground state wave functions in the two-exponential form. The main idea

13

is that the ﬁrst exponential represents the behaviour at small R and the second exponential

represents the behaviour at very large R. So, let us consider the following function:

f (R) = C

exp(
{

−

λR) + γ exp(

−

with

important peculiarity:

λ = α(1 + γ)

Here C, α, β and γ are arbitrary parameters. This two-exponential function possesses an

that is the ratio of the ﬁrst derivative to the function itself at the origin (R = 0) depends

upon only one parameter α. Let the second exponential in the RHS of Eq. (46) present

the behaviour of the wave functions in question at very large R. Then according to the

results of the previous sections (see Eqs. (19), (28)), we can put βs = √

2E

Z 2 and

−

−

αs = Z

1/2 for the electron-nucleus coalescence line of the singlet states. Considering C

−

as the normalization constant, we have only one unknown parameter, γ. It can be obtained

using the second derivative of the wave function F (R) at the origin. Then the double

diﬀerentiation of the general function (46) yields, in the limit of R approaching zero,

On the other hand, we have from Eq. (28):

Eq. (49) is a quadratic with respect to parameter γ.

The exponent λ of the ﬁrst exponential plays an important part in constructing the approx-

R. So, using Eq. (51) and the proper expressions for parameters αs and βs we have for the

ground state

To verify how good are the approximate functions (46) with the parameters of Table

on Fig. 2. Fs(R) and fs(R) are

The triplet states of the two-electron atomic systems are always excited states. Only the

electron-nucleus coalescence line is formed for these states according to the Pauli exclusion

principle. It is important that the corresponding wave function at the coalescence line Ft(R)

behaves according to Eq. (29) like R2 as R approaches zero. Therefore, the function (46)

is not suitable in this case. Instead, for the lowest energy triplet state we can propose the

simple approximate function of the form

It is easy to verify that the inequality λt > βt is valid for all Z. This condition is necessary to

make the behaviour of ft(R) close to the correct one. Fig. 3 demonstrates quite satisfactory

behaviour of the approximate functions (53), especially for R < 5 a.u. We can observe that

at small R the accuracy of ft(R) decreases with increasing Z, whereas at large R it increases

with Z. The dips on the graphs of Fig. 2 and 3 are artifacts of the logarithmic scale, since

the logarithm of the absolute value of the diﬀerence of the two functions goes to

at the

−∞

points of crossing the functions. The overall accuracy therefore can be inferred only at the

values of R not too close to the dip.

The case of the electron-electron coalescence is the most complicated, because of the

presence of the logarithmic term in the Eq. (43). However, the general two-exponential form

(46) can be applied in this case too, but without the representation (47).

For simplicity, let us put C = 1/(1 + γ) in Eq. (46). Then we obtain the approximate

function fe(R), which obeys the condition fe(0) = 1, that in turn enables one to compare

fe(R) with the expansion (43) in a simple manner. The exponent β representing the be-

haviour at very large R is equal to βe = 2√

E and has to obey the inequality λe > βe,

−
according to the asymptotic representation (39). So, we have two unknown parameters λe

and γe. The factor γe has to be positive, because the ground state wave function is nodeless.
e(R) at the origin we have f ′
Then, for the ﬁrst derivative f ′

Comparing this formula with Eq. (43), we obtain the ﬁrst constraint:

λe = 2Z + γe(2Z

βe).

−

(56)

It is easy to verify that the inequality 2Z > βe is valid for all Z

1. Therefore, for the

≥

parameters λe and γe obeying the constraint (56), the condition λe > βe will be valid for

any positive γe. To obtain the second constraint for the parameters λe and γe, one can use

17

integral S =

for example an integral property of the exact wave function Φ(R) such as the normalization
0 Φ2(R)R2dR with Φ(0) = 1. It is easy to calculate S using the accurate
CFHHM wave functions available. Replacing Φ(R) by fe(R) in the integrand, and executing

a simple integration, we obtain the second constraint in the form

The simplest way of solving the set of the equations (56), (57) is using the well-known

program Mathematica [15]. The equations have a number of roots (including complex ones).

However, only one root turned out to be real and positive, and therefore it could be applicable

to γe. The corresponding solutions along with the other accompanying quantities, E, S

and βe are presented in Table III. It is seen from Table III that the approximate function

parameters fulﬁll all the conditions mentioned above.

The degree of coincidence for the accurate and approximate Helium wave functions at

deviation curve for the two-exponential approximate function fe(R) of the Helium atom. For

comparison, we have also drawn the corresponding one-exponential function (42), presented

by the dotted line. The graphs are limited by the value of R = 2 a.u., because of the very

fast decay of the two-electron atomic wave functions at the electron-electron coalescence line.

V. CONCLUSION

We have considered and analyzed some particular solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation

for the two-electron atom or ion (with the nucleus charge Z and the total energy E) using

the accurate CFHHM wave functions. We have obtained mathematical relations between the

partial derivatives taken at the two-particle coalescence lines and the ordinary derivatives

of the wave function taken at the same coalescence lines. The relations were found for the

limit cases of very large and small distances R between one of the electrons and the other

electron close to the nucleus (electron-nucleus coalescence) or between the two electrons

close together and the nucleus (electron-electron coalescence). We have obtained the only

relation valid for all R

0 and Z

1. It connects the ﬁrst partial derivative on r1 (or r2)

≥

≥

and the ﬁrst ordinary derivative of wave function at the electron-electron coalescence line.

We have examined both singlet and triplet S-states, and obtained the asymptotic so-

lutions (for very large R) with the exponents

expansions in R and ln R in the vicinity of the triple coalescence point for small R. We have

found that the Fock’s logarithmic terms vanished at the electron-nucleus coalescence line,

unlike the case of the electron-electron coalescence, but only in the framework of the second

order expansion.

We have proposed simple two-exponential approximations for the two-electron atomic

wave functions at the coalescence points. The approximations are valid for the lowest energy

(nodeless) states.

It was demonstrated that all of the approximate functions have quite

satisfactory accuracy and could be employed at least for the initial qualitative evaluation of

a number of phenomena in the atomic physics.

High-precision determination of transition amplitudes of principal transitions in Cs
from van der Waals coeﬃcient C6

(Dated: January 13, 2014)

A method for determination of atomic dipole matrix elements of principal transitions from the
value of dispersion coeﬃcient C6 of molecular potentials correlating to two ground-state atoms is
proposed. The method is illustrated on atomic Cs using C6 deduced from high-resolution Fes-
hbach spectroscopy. The following reduced matrix elements are determined h6S1/2||D||6P1/2i =
−8 cm.) These matrix
4.5028(60) |e|a0 and h6S1/2||D||6P3/2i = 6.3373(84) |e|a0 (a0 = 0.529177 × 10
elements are consistent with the results of the most accurate direct lifetime measurements and have
a similar uncertainty. It is argued that the uncertainty can be considerably reduced as the coeﬃcient
C6 is constrained further.

PACS numbers: 32.10.Dk,34.20.Cf,32.70.Cs

The method is illustrated for atomic Cs.

The leading long-range interaction of two atoms in
their respective spherically-symmetric ground states is
described in terms of van der Waals coeﬃcient C6 [?
]. Studies of magnetic-ﬁeld induced Feshbach resonances
and photoassociation in ultracold atomic samples allow
to constrain this coeﬃcient. Several highly-accurate de-
terminations of C6 for alkali-metal dimers were recently
reported [? ? ? ? ? ]. Here we propose a method
for determination of electric-dipole matrix elements (or
lifetimes) of principal transitions from these coeﬃcients.
In recent
years the most accurate lifetimes for alkali-metal atoms
were derived using photoassociation spectroscopy of ul-
tracold atomic samples reviewed in Refs. [? ? ]. Un-
fortunately, this approach was not as successful for Cs
because of peculiarities of molecular potentials of the Cs
dimer [? ]. We consider an alternative method. Based
on the van der Waals coeﬃcient C6 deduced from ultra-
cold collision data, the calculations reported here lead to
the matrix elements for Cs with an uncertainty similar
to the best direct lifetime measurements. We note that
the determined high-precision dipole matrix element for
6S1/2 − 6P1/2 transition in Cs [? ]
is crucial for an in-
terpretation of the most accurate measurement [? ] of
atomic parity nonconservation (PNC). Atomic PNC [?
? ] provides powerful constraints on possible extensions
(e.g. extra Z-bosons) to the standard model of elemen-
tary particles.

For Cs, ? ] deduced C6 = 6890(35)1 using results
of high-resolution Feshbach spectroscopy [? ]. Recently
more Feshbach resonances due to higher angular mo-
menta were identiﬁed by Chu and co-workers and this
value has been constrained further to C6 = 6859(25) [?
].

The dispersion coeﬃcient C6 characterizes a second-

Here |vi is an atomic ground state (6S1/2 for Cs), ∆Ei

ments. For Cs almost 85% of C6 is accumulated from
intermediate states 6P1/2 and 6P3/2. We exploit this
strong dependence to deduce matrix elements of princi-
pal transitions by calculating residual contributions using
ab initio methods. We separate the contribution of 6PJ
states to dynamic polarizability and write

α (iω) = αp (iω) + αr (iω) ,

where αr combines contributions of other intermediate
states. These polarizabilities are shown in Fig. 1. Intro-

and the problem is reduced to an accurate determination

in the ratio R will be treated separately) and obtain

h6P1/2||D||6S1/2i = 4.5028(60) ,

4.4890(65) and h6P3/2||D||6S1/2i = 6.3265(77) and have
a comparable accuracy (see Fig. 2).

Details of calculation. — The parameter ξp can be
evaluated with a high precision using experimental en-
ergies and the ratio of matrix elements R from Ref.[?
]. We obtain ξp = 14.0787. The uncertainty induced in

(7)

(9)

this quantity by experimental error in the ratio R will be
addressed separately.

To determine parameters ξx and ξr we have to com-
pute the residual dynamic polarizability αr(iω). Here we
follow formalism laid out in Ref. [? ] and augment it with
a reﬁned error analysis. The intermediate states can be
separated into two classes - valence states, both bound
and continuum (α′

v) , and core-excited states (αc)

αr (iω) = α′

v (iω) + αc (iω) + αcv (iω) .

Here term αcv contains a small core-valence coupling cor-
rection addressed below.

In summation over valence states α′

v we use a com-
bination of relativistic linearized coupled-cluster singles-
doubles (CCSD) method and Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF)
approximation. In particular, the contribution from 7PJ
and 8PJ states is computed with the matrix elements ob-
tained in [? ] and experimental energies [? ]. The rest of
the valence states is incorporated using B-spline quasis-
pectrum [? ] generated in the “frozen” core DHF approx-
imation. In the summation over core-excited states we
employ relativistic random-phase approximation (RPA),
described in Refs. [? ? ] with an obvious extension
for frequency-dependence. In the RPA we allow for ex-
citations of core electrons to all possible valence states,
including the occupied 6S state. To account for a subse-
quent violation of the Pauli exclusion principle, a counter
core-valence coupling term αcv was introduced; we cal-
culate it in the DHF approximation.

Now we proceed to the calculation of parameter ξx. We
notice that in Eq. (7) a smooth and broad curve αr (iω)
is integrated with a narrow Lorentzian-shaped function
αp (iω) (see Fig. 1). To illustrate the main source of
uncertainty we approximate

ξx ≈ αr (0)

The error bars of the derived matrix elements depend
sensitively on the uncertainty of ξx. To estimate this
uncertainty, it is instructive to discuss characteristic ac-
curacies of various relativistic many-body methods. As a

We calculate this quantity in (i) Dirac-Hartree-Fock
(DHF) approximation,
(ii) linearized coupled-cluster
singles-doubles (CCSD) method [? ], and (iii) using
experimental energies [? ] and matrix elements [? ].
The results are presented in Table II.
It is clear that
the Hartree-Fock approximation has a 70% error and the
CCSD values have an accuracy in the order of 1%. Based
on this example we assign a 1% uncertainty to CCSD
contributions from 7PJ and 8PJ intermediate states and
a 70% uncertainty to the corrections from the rest of
the valence state and 70% to core-valence coupling term.
We further replace the RPA value for the static polar-
izability of the core with accurate semiempirical value
15.644(5) [? ] and obtain αs.e.
(0) = 17.18(40). Almost
r
entire error comes from the uncertainty of the Hartree-
Fock method. It is worth noting that the overall accu-
racy of the αv(0) and the derived matrix elements can
be further improved using, for example, linear-response
coupled-cluster method [? ]. Based on Eq. (12) we im-
prove the accuracy of the parameter ξx by rescaling the
ab initio value of the integral, Eq. (7), with the semiem-
pirical αs.e.
(0). The ﬁnal value for the quantity ξx is
r
46.0(1.0) .

The overwhelming contribution to parameter ξr comes
from the dynamic core polarizability αc (iω).
In sum-
mation over core-excited states we employ relativis-
tic random-phase approximation (RPA), described in
Refs. [? ? ] with an obvious extension for frequency-
dependence. Because of the equivalence of length- and
velocity-forms of dipole matrix elements in RPA, the
calculated dynamic polarizability of the core satisﬁes
an important Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn (TRK) sum rule

FIG. 3:
Sample Brueckner-Goldstone diagram illustrating
coupling of a doubly excited core state (double horizontal
line) to the many-body ground state of a closed-shell core
through a one-body dipole matrix element (wavy line). Such
contribution is possible only in a combination with correla-
tion part of the wavefunction of the ground state (ﬁrst order
correction is shown, with Coulomb interaction represented by
dashed line.)

limω→∞ αc(iω) = Nc/ω2, Nc being the number of core
electrons (Nc = 54 for Cs.) This property is illustrated
in Fig. 1 of Ref. [? ]. The static (ω = 0) core polar-
izability obtained with RPA is αc(0) = 15.81. This re-
sult is in a 1% agrement with a value of 15.644(5) de-
duced from semiempirical ﬁtting of Rydberg spectrum of
Cs [? ]. The RPA accounts only for a correlated con-
tribution of particle-hole excitations. However, the cor-
rection from multiple core excitations is expected to be
strongly suppressed because they can couple only to the
ﬁrst-order many-body correction to the core wavefunc-
tion (see Fig. 3). In addition, the eﬀect of multiple core
excitations is reduced by larger energy denominators in
the expression for polarizability.

Overall the RPA approximation results in a dynamic
core polarizability diﬀering from the high-precision value
by 1% at ω = 0 and at large frequencies recovering the
exact TRK limit [? ]. The parameter ξr calculated in-
cluding only core polarizability, ξr = 137.2, is slightly
increased by inclusion of valence states and the core-
valence coupling term αcv to 138.0. Based on the above
discussion we assign a 2% uncertainty to ξr and arrive
at ξr = 138.0(2.8). It should be noted that more conser-
vative error bar of 5% for ξr does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the resulting precision of derived matrix elements.

Employing C6 = 6859(25) [? ] and the calculated pa-
rameters ξ we determine the matrix element D1/2, and,
using the ratio R [? ], the matrix element D3/2. The
obtained values are given in Eq. (10). The uncertainty
in matrix element calculated from Eq. (9) can be param-

eterized as

where AC6 = 7.5 × 10−2, Ar = 3.0 × 10−5, Ax = 1.4 ×
10−3, and AR = 9.4 × 10−2. Combining estimated un-
certainties we obtain an error bound of 0.13% for matrix
elements. This accuracy is similar to that of the best
direct lifetime measurements by ? ]. The reader is re-
ferred to Ref. [? ]
for an extensive comparison with
other measurements and theoretical predictions. Our re-
sult is most sensitive to the errors in the van der Waals
coeﬃcient and parameter ξx. Provided that C6 is known
exactly, the uncertainty in the matrix elements can be re-
duced to 0.07% with the current technique for estimation
of ξx. It is worth noting that the precision of calculation
for ξx can be substantially improved, for example, using
linear-response coupled-cluster method [? ].

Conclusion.— We exploited a strong dependence of the
van der Waals coeﬃcient C6 on matrix elements of prin-
cipal transitions. We deduced these matrix elements by
calculating small residual contributions using ab initio
methods. The proposed method was applied to Cs atom
and the derived matrix elements are consistent with the

4

best direct lifetime measurements [? ] and have a similar
uncertainty.

In anticipation of high-precision measurements of
static dipole polarizability α(0) of the ground state of Cs
with atom interferometry [? ], we note that 96% of the
polarizability is due to the contribution of the principal
transitions αp(0) [? ]. Subtracting the residual contribu-
tion αs.e.
(0) = 17.18(40) from the measured α(0) one can
also determine matrix elements of principal transitions to
an accuracy of 0.05% from Eq. (3).

r

We employed the 0.36%-accurate value of the van der
Waals coeﬃcient C6 deduced by ? ] from high-resolution
Feshbach spectroscopy of ultracold Cs atoms [? ]. Ac-
cording to Ref. [? ] the precision of this dispersion co-
eﬃcient can be potentially improved to 0.03%. If such a
precision is achieved, the method proposed here, aug-
mented with more accurate ab initio calculations and
better measurements of the ratio R, can lead to deter-
mination of matrix elements of principal transitions with
an unprecedented 0.01% accuracy.

The creation of a Fermi-degenerate gas molecules using either photoassociation or the Feshbach
resonance is theoretically examined. This problem raises an interest because, unlike bosons, fermions
in general do not behave cooperatively, so that the collective association of, say, two million atoms
into one million molecules is not to be expected. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that the coupled Fermi system
displays collective Rabi-like oscillations and adiabatic passage between atoms and molecules, thereby
mimicking Bose-Einstein statistics. Cooperative association of a degenerate mixture of Bose and
Fermi gases could therefore serve as a shortcut to a degenerate gas of Fermi molecules.

Because of the large number of ro-vibrational degrees
of freedom in a molecule, laser cooling is diﬃcult if not
impossible to apply in practice, so that a laser-cooling-
based approach [1] to a Fermi-degenerate gas of atoms
will not work for molecules. Moreover, buﬀer-gas cool-
ing [2] and Stark-deceleration [3] techniques could take
years to reach quantum degeneracy. Here we report that
a degenerate gas of Fermi molecules could be formed by
applying either photoassociation [4] or a Feshbach res-
onance [5] to a degenerate mixture of Bose and Fermi
atoms [6–8]. The collective Fermi-atom-molecule sys-
tem is predicted to undergo Rabi-like oscillations, as well
as adiabatic passage, from atoms to molecules, thereby
mimicking cooperative behavior that was previously at-
tributed to Bose statistics [9,10].

Photoassociation occurs when two atoms absorb a laser
photon, thereby jumping from the free two-atom contin-
uum to a bound molecular state.
If the initial atoms
form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), then a photoas-
sociation laser could conceivably be used to collectively
convert a BEC of atoms into a BEC of molecules [11–13].
As it happens, collective free-bound photoassociation is
theoretically identical to magnetoassociation, whereby a
molecular condensate can be created when one atom from
a condensed pair spin ﬂips in the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld tuned near a Feshbach resonance [14–16]. Intuition
developed in one instance is therefore generally applica-
ble to the other, and we will often refer simply to collec-
tive association.

In analogy with coherent optical transients in few
level atomic systems [17], photoassociation of a BEC has
been predicted to facilitate Rabi-like oscillations between
atomic and molecular condensates [11–13], whereby an
entire gas of, say, two million Bose-condensed atoms are
collectively converted into a million molecules that are,
in turn, collectively converted back into (roughly) two
million atoms, ad inﬁnitum. Another interesting possi-
bility arises because the ground state of the system is
all atoms for large positive detunings and all molecules
for extremely negative detunings, so that a slow sweep
of the laser detuning from one extreme to the other

will collectively convert a BEC of atoms into a BEC
of molecules [11]. The Feshbach resonance was used
in a similar manner to observe [18] collective Ramsey
fringes between an atomic condensate and a small frac-
tion of molecular condensate dressed by dissociated atom
pairs [19,20].

The statistics of neutral atoms is determined by the
number of neutrons in the nucleus, which must be odd
for fermionic atoms and even for bosonic atoms. The
sum of the total number of neutrons in the nucleus of
the constituent atoms similarly determines the statistics
of neutral molecules. Accordingly, molecules formed by
free-bound association of two fermions will necessarily
result in a boson, whereas fermionic molecules are born
from the union of a boson and a fermion. Given a degen-
erate mixture of Bose and Fermi gases [6–8], is it possi-
ble that collective free-bound association could serve as
a source of Fermi molecules?

To address this question, we model a degenerate
Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms [6–8] coupled by ei-
ther a Feshbach resonance or photoassociation to a
Fermi-degenerate gas of molecules. The initial bosonic
[fermionic] atoms are denoted by the ﬁeld φ(r, t)
[ψ−(r, t)], and the fermionic molecules by the ﬁeld
ψ+(r, t). Neglecting particle-particle interactions, the
Hamiltonian density for such an untrapped system can

Here mB (m−) is the mass of a bosonic (fermionic) atom,

so-called chemical potential that implicitly accounts for
particle trapping, δ0 is the binding energy (detuning) of
the molecular state relative to the dissociation threshold,
and

is the (real) atom-molecule coupling.

Without loss of generality, we now make some simpli-
ﬁcations. First, the number of atoms, and the traps that
contain them, can be adjusted so that µB = µ− = µ.
Second is that atom-molecule conversion occurs on a
timescale much faster than the motion of the atoms in
the trap, allowing us to neglect the kinetic energies, and
justifying our omission of an explicit trapping potential
for the particles. Third, since the total number of parti-

served quantity, we may add the term µN to the Hamil-
tonian without altering the physics; upon doing so, we

also redeﬁne the detuning as δ = δ0 −
is that, whatever the Fermi energy associated with the
fermionic components, it lies within the Wigner thresh-
old regime [20], so that the coupling κ can be taken as
the same for all modes. Finally, we switch to momentum
space, but retain only the k = atomic condensate modes
since these transitions are favored over k
= 0 modes due
to Bose stimulation. The simpliﬁed Hamiltonian reads

where a annihilates a bosonic atom with wavevector

The system described by the Hamiltonian (2) is a par-
ticular nonlinear version of a two-level atom driven by an
external ﬁeld. Of course, the two-level atom is well known
to undergo Rabi ﬂopping [17], and similar behavior ob-
served for the present system would in principle answer
question of whether collective association will provide a
shortcut to the formation of a Fermi-degenerate gas of
molecules. We therefore consider an on-resonance sys-
tem, for which δ = 0 and the Heisenberg equations of
motion are

If the system starts out with NB bosonic atoms, the
operator a will have a characteristic size √NB. On the
other hand, while the fermionic operators bk and ck are
characteristically of order unity, the sum over momen-
tum states will ultimately introduce the initial number of
fermionic atoms. Hence, for equal numbers of bosons and
fermions, NB = NF = N , it is intuitively obvious that
the equations of motion (3) yield a system that evolves
with the characteristic frequency Ω = √Nκ.

Said intuition is conﬁrmed by solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation numerically, the results
of which are shown in Fig. 1. For the simplest case of
N = 1, the system undergoes complete conversion from
a doubly-degenerate Fermi-Bose system of atoms to a
Fermi-degenerate gas of molecules in a time Ω−1. How-
ever, considering a larger number of initial atoms, N = 5,

∼

we see that quantum many-body ﬂuctuations not only
frustrate complete conversion, but also adjust the oscil-
lation frequency and lead to a series of collapse and re-
vivals. Increasing the initial particle number to N = 10
brings the amplitude of the ﬁrst half-oscillation closer
to the ideal case. This behavior is exactly analogous to
the single-component bosonic case [11,13]. Although lim-
ited computational resources preclude the explicit inves-
tigation of large particle number, based on the bosonic
analogy [11,13] we fully expect the ﬁrst half oscillation
to be complete for large N , i.e., N
1 initial Fermi
atoms should be converted to N Fermi molecules over a
timescale τ

Ω−1.

Nevertheless, collisions between particles will shift the
energy of a state with a given number of atoms and
molecules in a manner that depends nonlinearly on the
numbers, making it diﬃcult to maintain exact resonance.
Furthermore, once a the system has Rabi ﬂopped to
molecules, the depopulated atomic condensate makes
Bose stimulation, and thus neglect of the k
= 0 BEC
modes, questionable. And so we investigate the more ro-
bust possibility of rapid adiabatic passage [17]. From the
Hamiltonian (2), it should be clear that the system will
favor all atoms for large positive detunings, while favor-
ing all molecules for large negative detunings. With Ω
established as the characteristic frequency for collective
atom-molecule conversion, then changes in the detuning
that are of the order of Ω, and occur over a time of order
Ω−1, should qualify as adiabatic. Hence, if the detun-
ξΩ2t,
ing is swept in a linear fashion according to δ =
then dimensionless sweep rates ξ <
∼ 1 should enable rapid
adiabatic passage to a degenerate gas of Fermi molecules.
Our suspicions are again corroborated by a numerical
solution to the Schr¨odinger equation, shown in Fig. 2.
While many-body eﬀects appear to rather seriously af-
fect the eﬃciency of a marginally adiabatic sweep (ξ = 1)
compared to the N = 1 case, the diﬀerence between
N = 5 and N = 10 (not shown) is in fact small. Over-
all, many-body eﬀects are expected to be weak for near-
1), and vanishing for sweeps that
adiabatic sweeps (ξ
are deep-adiabatic (ξ <
∼ 0.1), again in agreement with
our BEC experience [11]. On the matter of transitions
to noncondensate modes, we note that, in the all-boson
case [24], such transitions can be neglected for a sweep
directed as in Fig. 2, i.e., for ˙δ < 0. Given the success
of the analogy so far, similar results are expected for a
Fermi system.

Before closing, we estimate some explicit numbers.
We eschew photoassociation because of the losses associ-
ated with the electronically-excited state [25], and focus
on the atom-molecule coupling provided by the 87Rb -
40K Feshbach resonance located at B0 = 534 G [21],
which has a width ∆R = 4 G and an associated
zero-ﬁeld Fermi-Bose-atom scattering length aF B

17.8 nm. Accordingly, the atom-molecule coupling is

which two consequences: (i) the atomic BEC will act as a

Fermi sea [26]; (ii) barring an unfortunately large scatter-
ing length for Bose-atom and Fermi-molecule collisions,
we can neglect the possibility of any Fermi-Bose collapse
instabilities [8]. For NB ≫

This timescale is safely below the fastest timescale for

10−3 s,
justifying our neglect of trap dynamics and the kinetic
energy. Similarly, the timescale for Bose atom-atom and
Fermi-Bose atom-molecule collisions are roughly equal,
τc ∼

0.1 ms, and are also reasonably neglected.

Lastly, a problem with the Feshbach resonance is
noted: the molecules it creates, while translationally and
rotationally ultracold, are vibrationally very hot, and are
therefore highly susceptible to vibrational relaxation in-
duced by collisions with unconverted atoms (molecule-
molecule collisions are Pauli blocked). There is no known
handle on such transitions for the present system. Us-
ing the sodium numbers [14,16] for comparison, Fermi-
Bose [Fermi-Fermi] collisions are estimated to cause vi-
brational relaxation on a timescale τ F B
(√ρBρF ×
10−10)−1 s = 1 ms [τ F F
10−10)−1 s = 10 ms],
which is also negligible. If collision-induced vibrational
relaxation of the molecules does turn out to be a prob-
lem, the trap could be expanded to further reduce the
rate of collisions with unconverted atoms.

In conclusion, we highlight that the term Ω = √N κ
was previously referred to as the Bose-enhanced free-
bound coupling, and the detuning sweep, e.g., referred to
as Bose-stimulated rapid adiabatic passage from atoms to
molecules. However, this behavior is now clearly indepen-
dent of statistics, so that Bose stimulation of free-bound
association has nothing whatsoever to do with Bose
statistics, but is instead a many-body cooperative eﬀect
that applies equally well to Fermi-degenerate systems.
To four-wave mixing in a Fermi gas of atoms [22,23],
we therefore add the above two examples of fermions
mimicking an eﬀect that was previously attributed to
Bose-Einstein statistics. Such behavior should allow for
a shortcut to a degenerate gas of Fermi molecules via
photoassociation or the Feshbach resonance.

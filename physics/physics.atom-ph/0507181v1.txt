We show how to prepare a single molecular ion in a speciﬁc internal quantum state in a situation
where the molecule is trapped and sympathetically cooled by an atomic ion and where its internal
degrees of freedom are initially in thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. The scheme is based
on conditional creation of correlation between the internal state of the molecule and the translational
state of the collective motion of the two ions, followed by a projection measurement of this collective
mode by atomic ion shelving techniques. State preparation in a large number of internal states is
possible.

Investigations of production and trapping of cold neu-
tral and ionic molecules [1, 2, 3] point to a wealth of pos-
sible applications, including studies of molecular Bose-
Einstein condensates [4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
investigations of
collision and reaction dynamics at low temperature [9],
high-resolution spectroscopy [10], coherent control exper-
iments [11], and state speciﬁc reactions studies [12, 13].
For much of this research, long-term localized and state-
speciﬁc targets are highly desirable. One way to obtain
such targets is to work with trapped molecular ions sym-
pathetically cooled by atomic ions where previous inves-
tigations show that molecular ions can be translationally
cooled to temperatures of a few mK, at which stage they
become immobile and localize spatially in Coulomb crys-
tal structures [14, 15]. Though these molecules are trans-
lationally cold, studies indicate that the internal degrees
of freedom of at least smaller hetero-nuclear molecules,
due to their interaction with the black-body radiation
(BBR), are close to be in equilibrium with the tem-
perature of the surroundings [16]. This is not unex-
pected since the many order of magnitude diﬀerence be-
tween the internal transitions frequencies in the molecule
(& 1011 Hz) and the frequency of the collective vibra-
tional modes in the Coulomb crystals (. 107 Hz) leads
to very ineﬃcient coupling between these degrees of free-
dom. Several schemes were recently proposed to cool the
rotational temperature of translationally cold heteronu-
clear molecular ions [17, 18].

Here, we focus on an alternative route to the pro-
duction of molecular ions in speciﬁc states. The phys-
ical system used for this purpose consists of one trapped
molecular ion sympathetically cooled by a simultaneously
trapped atomic ion. Such a situation was previously re-
alized and it was shown to be possible to determine the
molecular ion species non-destructively by a classical res-
onant excitation of one of the two axial collective modes
of the two-ion system [15]. With this setup, we now pro-
pose to exploit the quantum aspect of the same collective
modes to create correlations between the internal state of

the molecular ion and the collective motional state in the
trap potential. Previously, correlations in two-ion sys-
tems were essential in, e.g., demonstrations of quantum
logical gates [19] and in a proposal for high-resolution
spectroscopy [20].

As depicted in Fig. 1, the state preparation of the
molecular ion ideally involves the following steps. First,
the two-ion system is cooled to its collective motional
ground state [21, 22] with the molecule in the electronic
ground state and with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
over rovibrational states. We consider only one of the two
independent axial modes of the two-ion system and refer
to it as the collective mode. Second, laser ﬁelds are ap-
plied to induce transitions between the ground and the
ﬁrst excited motional states conditioned on the speciﬁc
rovibrational state of the molecular ion. This procedure
creates correlations between the motional state of the
two-ion system and the internal state of the molecular
ion. Next, conditioned on an excitation of the collective
mode, an atomic shelving transition to a metastable state
is driven by another laser ﬁeld. Finally, laser ﬁelds are
applied to project the atomic ion on the shelved (non-
ﬂuorescing) or non-shelved (ﬂuorescing) state. If no ﬂuo-
rescence is observed, we conclude that the molecular ion
is in the internal state of interest. Contrary, if ﬂuores-
cence is present, the ion is not in the desired state. In
the latter case, after a duration of time suﬃciently long
to bring the molecule back in thermal equilibrium (typ-
ically through interaction with BBR), the procedure is
repeated. Eventually, no ﬂuorescence is detected in the
ﬁnal step, and the molecular ion is known to be in the
desired quantum state. A state-to-state analysis of the
procedure is presented schematically in Table I.

Before a discussion of a realistic implementation of the
proposed scheme, we evaluate the eﬀect of imperfections
in the various steps of the procedure.

1) Initialization of the external state of the two-ion
system (IE). Cooling of a two-ion system completely
to the motional ground state, |0iTr, is unrealistic, but

FIG. 1: (color online) Idealized sketch of the state-selection
sequence. The ﬁrst step is cooling to the ground state of the
collective translational mode, |0iTr with the molecule in the
electronic ground state and with the internal rovibrational
states characterized by a statistical ensemble |Ximol. The
second step is to correlate the collective mode of the two-ion
system with the internal state of the molecule by exciting the
collective mode to |1iTr if the molecule is in a speciﬁc internal
state, |χdimol. Next, if the collective mode is excited, condi-
tional shelving transfers the atom to the long-lived metastable
state, |siat. Finally, the projection measurement proceeds by
exposing the atomic ion to light which is resonant with the
transition between the atomic ground state, |giat, and an ex-
cited state, |eiat. Rescattered light will then be absent only
if the atom is in the shelved state and hence the the molecule
in the desired internal state |χdimol.

ternal modes and Internal molecular state. CS: Conditional

denotes the modiﬁed statistical ensemble of internal molecu-
lar states when the desired state, |χdimol, has been removed
from |Ximol. The portion of the ensemble of rovibrational
states that was initially in the desired molecular state |χdimol
is conditional shelved and unaﬀected by the projection mea-
surement. The remaining rovibrational states, on the other
hand, are unaﬀected by the conditional shelving and therefore
lead to ﬂuorescence upon projection measurement.

several experiments show that it is feasible to achieve
W0 = 95% population in |0iTr in the case of two atomic
ion species [21, 22]. The same degree of cooling is ex-
pected for an atomic-molecular ion system. We therefore

2

use a Boltzmann distribution with W0 = 95%, and this
results in W1 ≃ 4.7% and W2 ≃ 0.3% for the populations
in |1iTr and |2iTr, respectively.

2) Correlation of external motion and the internal
molecular state (CEI). This part of the procedure can,
e.g., be accomplished by inducing transitions between
rotational sub-states of the molecule using Raman π-
pulses [19, 23] in a way similar to that demonstrated
for sub-states in atomic ions [23]. Alternatively, if there
are no rotational sub-states, as in the case of J=0,
or if for some reason it is desired to stay in a spe-
ciﬁc sub-state, a sequence of two laser pulses can be
applied like in STIRAP processes[24]. First, a pulse
couples the ﬁnal state, |χdimol |1iTr, and intermediate
states, |χ′imol |νiTr, with a coupling strength character-
ized by the free molecule Rabi frequency, Ωs(t), while
a delayed pulse couples the initial state, |χdimol |0iTr,
to |χ′imol |νiTr with free molecule Rabi frequency Ωp(t).
Here, |χdimol and |χ′imol denote the desired and inter-
mediate molecular state, respectively. Though the pulse
sequence resembles a STIRAP process, there is an im-
portant diﬀerence since the two laser pulses, that are
only shifted in frequency by the collective mode fre-
quency (≃ 10 MHz), do interact with same internal tran-
sitions of the molecule. To model the eﬀect of such
a two-pulse process, we expand the state of the two-
νTr,max
ion system as |Ψ(t)i = P
νTr=0 cνTr(t) |χdimol |νiTr +
bνTr(t) |χ′imol |νiTr with νTr,max = 5 for convergence,
initial condition c0(t = 0) = 1 and desired ﬁnal state
|χdimol |1iTr.
In the simulations, both laser pulses are
assumed to be Gaussian in time with a width τ = 50
µs(FWHM) and separated by 1.3τ . Furthermore, we
assume the intermediate molecular state to be a vibra-
tional excited state with a spontaneous decay rate of 100
s−1. With a realistic molecular transition wavelength of
4 µm, a maximum free molecule Rabi frequencies of 7
MHz for both pulses, and a detuning from the intermedi-
ate state of δ ≃ 10 MHz, we ﬁnd that more than 80 % of
the population can be transferred to motional excited
states. Of experimental importance, the transfer eﬃ-
ciency was found to be stable when varying the detuning
a few MHz [26]. In the following, we use the more con-
servative estimate of the transfer eﬃciency, ℘CEI = 0.7.
3) External state conditional shelving (CS). Shelving
conditioned on excitation of the collective mode can,
e.g., be achieved by driving red side-band transitions
between motional states by π-pulses [23].
As an
alternative, we consider the STIRAP type process
|giat to the shelved
from the atomic ground state,
atomic state, |siat, via an intermediate state, |iiat. We
expand the state of the combined system as |Ψ(t)i =
P
+aν(t)Tr|siat |χdimol |νiTr(cid:1). As initial conditions we use
the ﬁnal amplitudes from the CEI step, which showed
signiﬁcant population in the ﬁrst few excited motional
states. Our simulations show a transfer eﬃciency ℘CS

νTr,max
νTr=0 (cid:0)cν(t)Tr|giat |χdimol |νiTr + bν(t)Tr|iiat |χdimol |νiTr

of more than 95 % is obtained even with population
in several excited motional states. We use the more
conservative estimate ℘CS = 0.7 in the following.

4) Projection measurement (PM). The ﬁnal step, pro-
jection measurement on the atomic ion, can be made very
eﬃcient. With a typical exposure time T = 5 ms, one
should be able to determine the projected atomic state
with more than a 95 % conﬁdence [25].

-Over-all conﬁdence of steps 1)-4). The probability of
being in the ideal initial state |giat |χdimol |0iTr is Pχd W0,
where Pχd denotes the initial population in |χdimol and
Wν the initial population in the collective motional state
|νiTr. Since this state has to go through both CEI and
CS to reach the shelved state, the probability of ﬁnd-
ing the molecule in the shelved state after the selection
sequence is Sprep = Pχd W0℘CEI ℘CS. Unfortunately, a
false positive result can occur if the system is initially in
a state |νiTr with ν ≥ 1 since the system may proceed
through CS without exciting the motional state during
CEI. The probability of a false positive measurement is
then E = (1 − Pχd )(1 − W0)℘CS, where the ﬁrst two
factors account for the initial population in the excited
states of the collective motion, but not in |χdimol, and
the last factor accounts for the necessary application
of CS. We deﬁne the conﬁdence of a measurement as
F = Sprep(cid:14)(Sprep + E).

As a test case we assume Pχd = 5% and use a thermal
distribution over external vibrational states determined
by letting W0 = 95 %. Non-ﬂuorescence in the ﬁnal stage
of the state preparation then give a conﬁdence of the
molecule being in |χdimol of about F ≃ 0.4 which is too
marginal for the procedure to be useful.

5) State puriﬁcation (SP). The principal source of error
is false positive detections stemming from initial popu-
lation in |1iTr. These errors are excluded by use of the
state-puriﬁcation procedure presented in Table II. If no
ﬂuorescence is detected after the state preparation pro-
cess, CEI is reapplied. The second step is another CS
process transferring |siat to |giat on the red sideband of
the collective motion. Finally PM is repeated. The de-
sired ﬁnal state is now ﬂourescent while other states are
dark.

The probability of a successful detection after the SP
procedure is estimated by Spur = Sprep℘CEI ℘CS, as the
population has to go through both CEI and CS after the
state preparation. The probability of a false positive de-
tection caused by population initially in excited motional
states is now given by E1 = Wl≥2(1 − Pχd)℘2
CS, since the
system must start in the second excited state or higher
to pass CS twice without being excited during CEI. An-
other source of false positive measurements appears due
to stochastic heating during the relatively slow PM pro-
cess. Assuming a heating rate of Γ = 10 vibrational
quanta per second [21], the error induced by stochastic
heating is E2 = T Γ(1 − Pχd )W1℘2
CS, since only popu-
lation initially in |1iTr will introduce error which is not

accounted for in E1.

The conﬁdence of state preparation after SP is deﬁned
as F ′ = Spur(cid:14)(Spur + E1 + E2) and SP improves the
conﬁdence of state preparation to more than 80 % (see
Fig. 2). Note that if W0 = 100%, the measurement cy-
cle leads to 100 % certain state-preparation without SP,
while increasing ρCEI to 100% only leads to 10% increase
in the conﬁdence of the ﬁnal state preparation. Finally,
we note that the preparation eﬃciency is independent of
the conditional shelving eﬃciency, ℘CS.

As an alternative to PS, we may perform CEI and
i.e., consider
CS on the second motional sideband,
|giat |χdimol |0iTr − |giat |χdimol |2iTr
in the CEI step
and |giat |χdimol |2iTr − |siat |χdimol |0iTr in the CS step.
Since the initial probability W2 for being in |2iTr is
much smaller than W1, the conﬁdence of the prepa-
ration is improved considerably without applying SP,
and simply given by F ′′ = Sprep(cid:14)(Sprep + E′′) with
E′′ = E × (1 − W0 − W1)/(1 − W0) ∼ E × 0.06. The
required laser intensity would, however, increase signiﬁ-
cantly due to the weaker coupling between |0iTr and |2iTr
compared with the |0iTr – |1iTr coupling.

The average time needed for the performance of a suc-
cessful detection depends partly on the probability of
ﬁnding the molecule in |χdimol at thermal equilibrium,
partly on the time needed for the projection measurement
cycle including the puriﬁcation step, and partly on the
time scale for re-thermalization. Even for polar diatomic
molecules with a relative large rotational constant, the
time scale for re-thermalization (τre ∼ 5 s) is much longer
than the projection measurement cycle. Hence, the aver-
age time is estimated by τre/Sprep which for a state with
an thermal population of ∼ 10 % is ∼ 100s.

As a speciﬁc test case for an implementation of the
state preparation scheme, we now focus on a MgH+ ion
internally in equilibrium with BBR at 300 K and trapped
together with an atomic ion amenable for CS, e.g., a
Ca+ ion. We neglect the vibrational quantum number
and take into account only the rotational states of the

The rotational
Boltzman-distribution presented in Fig. 2. We calculate
the conﬁdence F ′ for the molecular ion to be found in
a speciﬁc rotational state after application of the state
preparation and state puriﬁcation scheme. The results
presented in Fig. 2 show that the ion can be prepared
in all 11 represented rotational states with high conﬁ-
dence. Hence, if the aim is to study the dependence of a
process on the internal state of a molecule, starting out
with an internally hot molecular ion may turn out to be
advantageous.

The above presented scheme is not restricted to di-
atomic molecular ions. For more complex molecules at
thermal equilibrium, the number of populated internal
states increases, and hence the population of the individ-
ual states will eventually be too low to prepare a molecule
in a fully speciﬁed quantum state. The scheme could,
however, be used to specify one speciﬁc quantum num-
ber by a suitable choice of the intermediate state in the
Raman process used to correlate the internal state of the
molecule with the external motional mode.

At a more reﬁned level of manipulation and of interest
for quantum information processing, the two-ion system
discussed here may be used to create and study entan-
glement between atomic and molecular species.

In conclusion, we presented a method to prepare a
single trapped molecular ion in speciﬁc states with high
conﬁdence. Of great prospect for state speciﬁc investiga-
tions, the probabilistic nature of the preparation process

makes it possible to access a large number of states within
a thermal distribution in a relative simple experimental
way.

We investigate the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of particle-hole pairs in ultracold Fermionic
atoms with repulsive interactions and arbitrary polarization, which are trapped within optical lat-
tices. Near a Feshbach resonance, the dynamics of particle-hole pairs can be described by a hard-core
Bose-Hubbard model. The insulator - superﬂuid/BEC and charge-density-wave ( CDW)/solid - su-
perﬂuid/BEC phase transitions can be induced by decreasing and increasing the potential depths
with controlling the trapping laser intensity, respectively. The parameter and polarization depen-
dence of the critical temperatures for the ordered states (BEC and/or CDW) is discussed simulta-
neously.

In recent years, the demonstration of Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) of particle-particle pairs in homo-
geneous or conﬁned two-component (spin-1/2) ultracold
fermionic atoms has triggered great theoretical and ex-
perimental interest. The BCS-BEC crossover in ultracold
Fermi atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance has been
predicted by using the resonance superﬂuidity theory [1],
and been observed in experiments [2]. For the fermionic
atoms trapped within optical lattices, the s-wave or d-
wave particle-particle pairs can undergo a phase transi-
tion to a superﬂuid state when the inter-component in-
teraction is attractive or repulsive [3].

With the mechanism of the superﬂuidity/BEC of
atom-atom pairs in ultracold Fermi atomic gases be-
ing explored more and more deeply, the question arises
whether the atom-hole pairs in ultracold Fermi atomic
gases can undergo a BEC phase transition similar to
electron-hole pairs [4]. Theoretical results indicated
that the electron-hole pairs behave as weakly interact-
ing bosonic particles and are expected to undergo the
BEC phase transition in the dilute limit. Since all con-
densed particle-hole pairs can emit photons in tandem,
the quantum coherence in such a condensate will reveal
novel optical eﬀects and nonlinear optical dynamics. This
provides possible applications in ultrafast digital logical
elements and quantum computation.

In this letter, we show that the atom-hole pairs in ar-
bitrarily polarized spin-1/2 ultracold Fermi atoms with
repulsive interaction, which are trapped within optical
lattices, can undergo a superﬂuid/BEC phase transition
similar to the ultracold bosonic atoms conﬁned in optical
lattices [5]. Near a Feshbach resonance, the dynamics of
atom-hole pairs can be described by a hard-core Bose-
Hubbard model. Then, the phase transition is analyzed
with the derived Bose-Hubbard model. At the same time,
the critical temperature for the ordered states (charge-
density-wave,CDW and/or Bose-Einstein condensation)
is discussed within the mean-ﬁeld theory.

Consider an ensemble of arbitrarily polarized ultracold
fermionic atoms occupying two diﬀerent hyperﬁne states
|Si and |P i, which are trapped within the optical lattices.
For simplicity, we assume the optical lattice potentials
as V s,p
cos2(kxj ). The wave vector k is
0
determined by the laser wave-lengths, d (=1, 2 or 3) is
the dimension of the optical lattices, and V s,p
are pro-
portional to the laser intensity. For suﬃcient low tem-
perature, all atoms will be localized into the lowest Bloch
band, and the system can be described by an asymmetric
Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian [3]

be induced by varying the potential depth V s

controlling the laser intensity [6]. Usually, the hop-
ping/tunneling strengths increase with the decrease of
potential depths. The on-site interaction U is propor-
tional to the s-wave scattering length between atoms oc-
cupying diﬀerent hyperﬁne states. The s-wave scattering
between atoms occupying the same hyperﬁne state is ab-
sent due to the Pauli blocking.

The symbol NL is the total number of lattice sites. In
the following, we focus our interests on the half-ﬁlled case
(n = 1), i.e., one atom per site.

The ground state energy per atom depends upon both
the polarization and the energy diﬀerence (∆ǫ = ǫp − ǫs)
between two occupied states. With the deﬁnition of po-
larization, the ground states can be divided into ﬁve dif-
ferent regimes: non-polarized (NP) ground states with
γ = 0, partially polarized in state |Si (PPS) with
0 < γ < 1, partially polarized in state |P i (PPP) with
−1 < γ < 0, fully polarized in state |Si (FPS) with γ = 1
and fully polarized in state |P i (FPP) with γ = −1.
For the one dimensional lattices (d = 1) with state-
independent hopping (ts = tp = t), these regimes can
be exactly obtained with the Bethe-ansatz [7]. The ∆ǫ

In the strong repulsive limit near a Feshbach resonance
(0 < ts,p ≪ U ), the Fermi-Hubbard model is equivalent
to an eﬀective spin-1/2 Heisenberg model [8]. For inﬁ-
nite repulsive interaction (U → +∞), the ground states
(lowest energy states) have only one atom for each site,
and their charge degrees of freedom are frozen. With this
condition, one can introduce the bosonic operators

for the atom-hole pairs on site j. The operator b+
j (bj) cre-
ates (annihilates) a pair of S-atom (atom in |Si) and P-
hole (hole in |P i) on site j. Using the perturbation theory
developed by Takahashi [8], up to third order terms of the
perturbation parameters (hopping strengths), we obtain
the atom-hole pairs obey the hard-core Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian

Hard-core means that two same pairs occupying a single
lattice site is impossible, this is the results of Pauli block-
ing between fermionic atoms. Denoting tp = αts = αt,
we obtain the hopping strength J = 4tpts/U = 4αt2/U ,
the nearest neighbor interaction strength V = 2(t2
s +
t2
p)/U = 2(1 + α2)t2/U and the chemical potential µ =
∆ǫ + ZV /2 = ∆ǫ + Z(1 + α2)t2/U . For the cubic lat-
tices, the total number of the nearest neighbors Z equals
2d. The above hard-core Bose-Hubbard model can be
mapped onto an anisotropic spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg
model with Jxy = J, Jz = V and an eﬀective magnetic
ﬁeld Bz = ∆ǫ [9]. The antiferromagnetic-Z order, XY-
order and fully magnetized states in XXZ model corre-
spond to the CDW/solid phase, BEC/superﬂuid phase
and fully polarized insulator phase of the atom-hole pairs,
respectively [9, 10].

At zero temperature, the ground states for the atom-
hole pairs have three diﬀerent phases: (i) charge-density-
wave (CDW) /solid phase with zero polarization (γ = 0)
corresponds to the half-ﬁlled case of the hard-core Bose-
Hubbard model (hb+bi = 1/2), (ii) Bose-Einstein con-
densation (BEC) /superﬂuid phase with non-zero or-
der parameter hbi, and (iii) insulator phase with the
largest polarization (|γ| = 1) corresponds to the empty
(hb+bi = 0) or the fully-ﬁlled (hb+bi = 1) case of the
hard-core Bose-Hubbard model. The diﬀerence between
superﬂuid and insulator phases indicates that it need a
non-fully polarized atomic gases to support the atom-
hole BEC. From the equivalence between the hard-core
Bose-Hubbard model and the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg
model, using the path-integral method [11], one can ob-
tain that the fully polarized insulator phase appears
when |∆ǫ| /U > Z(t/U )2(1 + α)2, the BEC phase ex-
ists if (Z/2)(t/U )2
(1 − α2)2 < |∆ǫ| /U < Z(t/U )2(1 +
α)2, and the CDW phase emerges when |∆ǫ| /U <
(Z/2)(t/U )2
(1 − α2)2. The separatrix between CDW
phase and BEC phase corresponds to a ﬁrst order phase
transition. The points on this separatrix means the co-
existence of both phases, they represents the supersolid
phase. These conditions also show the CDW/solid -
BEC/superﬂuid and insulator - BEC/superﬂuid transi-
tions occur at |∆ǫ| /U = (Z/2)(t/U )2
(1 − α2)2 and
|∆ǫ| /U = Z(t/U )2(1 + α)2, respectively.

∆ǫ and on-site repulsive interaction strength U , increas-
ing (decreasing) the hopping strength t will induce an
insulator-superﬂuid (solid-superﬂuid) transition. This
means that the BEC/superﬂuidity of atom-hole pairs ex-
ists for mediate hopping strengths. For larger (smaller)
hopping strength, the ground states fall into the phase
of CDW/solid (fully polarized insulator). In the case of
state-independent hopping, α = 1, the CDW/solid region
becomes a line localized at ∆ǫ = 0. This is consistent
with the results of the antiferromagnetic phase in Refs.
[3].

FIG. 2: Zero-temperature phase diagram of the ground states
for the atom-holes in arbitrarily dimensional lattices with α =
2.

At ﬁnite temperatures, due to the thermal ﬂuctuations,
the ordered phases will be destroyed when the temper-
ature is above some critical temperatures. Within the
framework of the mean-ﬁeld theory [12], a continuous
phase transition between the CDW/solid and the normal
liquid (NL) takes place at the critical temperature

Here, kB is the Boltzmann constant. The bicritical po-
larizations γ = ±γBC(α)(γBC > 0) are given by T C

CDW and | γ |6= 1. Below the critical temperatures,
there are two coexistence regions of CDW/solid and su-
perﬂuid, which correspond to the supersolid regions. The
boundaries between the superﬂuid and supersolid and be-
tween CDW/solid and supersolid can be obtained by us-
ing the Landau expansion [13]. At zero temperature,
the critical polarization corresponding to the superﬂuid-
supersolid transition is given as γSF C = |(1−α)/(1+α)|.

3

For the case of state-independent hopping (α = 1),
the critical polarization γSF C = 0, it means that the
CDW/solid and supersolid regions shrink to a line local-
ized at γ = 0. This indicates that the atom-hole BEC in
non-polarized atoms with state-independent hopping has
the highest critical temperature for the superﬂuid phase.
The ﬁnite temperature phase transitions rely on the
hopping ratio α and the polarization γ. For state-
independent hopping (α = 1), CDW/solid - NL and
BEC/superﬂuid - NL transitions occur in non-polarized
(γ = 0) and polarized case (γ 6= 0), respectively. For
state-dependent hopping (α 6= 1), the transition routes
become more complex. The CDW/solid - NL, super-
solid - CDW/solid - NL, BEC/superﬂuid - supersolid -
CDW/solid - NL, and BEC/superﬂuid -NL phase tran-
sitions take place when γ = 0, 0 < |γ| ≤ γSF C,
γSF C < |γ| < γBC , and |γ| ≥ γBC , respectively.

The critical temperatures are determined by both the
parameters and the polarization. The parameter depen-
[3], T C ∝ t2/U .
dence is similar to the one of Refs.
Thus, to increase the critical temperatures, one has to de-
crease the potential depths V s,p
to increase the hopping
strengths. The polarization dependence of the critical
temperatures and the ﬁnite temperature phase diagram
are shown in FIG. 3 for the state-dependent hopping case
with α = 2.

Because J2 ≪ J1 ≈ J and V2 ≪ V1 ≈ V , the above
equations indicate that the critical temperatures are only
shifted a little bit by the high-order terms.

In summary, we have demonstrated the existence of
Bose-Einstein condensation of atom-hole pairs in arbi-
trarily polarized ultracold fermionic atoms conﬁned in
optical lattices with half ﬁlling.
In the strong repul-
sive limit, the atom-hole pairs obey a hard-core Bose-
Hubbard Hamiltonian. For a polarized insulator phase,
the particle-hole pairs undergo an insulator - super-
ﬂuid/BEC transition when the hopping between nearest
neighbors is increased. For a charge-density-wave (CDW)
phase, the pairs undergo a CDW - superﬂuid/BEC tran-
sition when the hopping is decreased. The mean-ﬁeld
results indicate that the ﬁnite temperature phase transi-
tion depends upon not only the system parameters but
also the polarization.

To realize the considered model, one can prepare an
ultracold two-component atomic Fermi gases with arbi-
trary polarization [2], then load them into an optical lat-
tice with one atom per site. The optical lattices can
be produced with a series of standing-wave lasers. The
strong repulsive limit can be accomplished by applying
an uniform magnetic ﬁeld to induce a Feshbach resonance
[14]. The applied magnetic ﬁeld will also induce a energy
diﬀerence between two occupied levels due to the Zeeman
eﬀects. To observe the superﬂuidity/BEC of the atom-
hole pairs, one can use Bragg scattering approach to de-
tect the elementary excitations spectrum of cold atoms
by monitoring the scattered atoms versus the frequency
diﬀerence between two lasers [15], which form the light
grating. In the superﬂuid phase, it will appear a distin-
guished peak corresponding to the collective Bigoliubov
quasi-particle excitations. In a condensed system of in-
teracting atom-hole pairs within an applied electromag-
netic ﬁeld, the stimulated two-photon emission (second
order harmonics emission) process can also give a credi-
ble evidence for the atom-hole BEC [16]. In this process,
the number of the condensed atom-hole pairs decreases
with the emission of the second order harmonics of the
applied light.

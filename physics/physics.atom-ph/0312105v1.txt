We have realized a two-species mirror-magneto-optical trap containing a mixture of 87Rb (85Rb)
′
and 133Cs atoms. Using this trap, we have measured the heteronuclear collisional loss rate β
Rb−Cs
due to intra-species cold collisions. We ﬁnd a distinct diﬀerence in the magnitude and intensity
dependence of β′
Rb−Cs for the two isotopes 87Rb and 85Rb which we attribute to the diﬀerent
ground-state hyperﬁne splitting energies of the two isotopes.

Since the ﬁrst experiments in 1999 [1] demonstrating
the trapping of atoms using micron scale wires fabri-
cated on a reﬂective substrate (the so-called “atom chip”)
there has been increased interest in techniques for cool-
ing, trapping, and controlling atoms at surfaces. Various
devices have been proposed and are now being realized in
the laboratory including atomic beamsplitters and wave
guides [2, 3, 4, 5]. Indeed, suﬃcient progress has been
made that a BEC can now be created and manipulated
using atom-chip techniques. In a parallel development,
the investigation of cold atomic clouds of mixed atomic
species has also attracted substantial attention, giving
rise to intense eﬀorts to generate cold hetero-nuclear
molecules [6, 7] for application to fundamental measure-
ments [4] and for quantum information technologies [7].
To date, however, there have been no reports of mixed
species trapping with surface trap technologies.

In this paper we report the realization of a two-species
surface trap – the two-species mirror-magneto-optical
trap (TSMMOT). As with other atom traps, the perfor-
mance of the trap (e.g density, number, etc.) is strongly
aﬀected by collisionally induced trap loss
[8, 9, 10].
We have therefore used the TSMMOT to investigate the
cold collisions of atomic Cs with 87Rb (85Rb). We fo-
cus on measurements made in the low intensity regime
(2Isat ≤ I ≤ 8Isat where Isat is the atomic trapping
transition saturation intensity). Mixed species Cs-Rb
trap losses have been recently characterized in a stan-
dard MOT over a broad range of laser intensities [10].
Our results are distinct in that we ﬁnd an isotopic dif-
ference, which to our knowledge has not been previously
observed, and which we attribute to ground-state inter-
species hyperﬁne changing processes.

In our experiments, trapping light was provided by
line-narrowed extended cavity diode lasers locked to the
trapping transitions using a dichroic (DAVLL) scheme
[11, 12]. Acousto-optical modulators (AOM) were used
to detune the light from the locking point to the cool-
ing transition by -1 ΓRb (-2.1 ΓRb) for 85Rb (87Rb) and
by -1.3 ΓCs for Cs. To assure uniform Gaussian beams,
all trapping light was passed through single-mode opti-
cal ﬁbers. After the ﬁbers, the beams had an 1/e2 waist
of 0.4 cm. A series of polarizing beam splitter cubes
(PBSC) and half-wave plates were used to mix the trap-

ping light and to tune the individual intensities of the
repumping and trapping light of each species. The ad-
justments were made to optimize the size, shape, and
overlap of both atomic clouds.

The surface used for this TSMMOT conﬁguration was
fabricated in-house using thin-ﬁlm hybrid technology [1]:
a top layer 0.7 µm thick of highly reﬂective (95%) Ag
was evaporated onto a 1 µm SiO2 sputtered layer, all de-
posited onto a 300 µm thick Si wafer. Similar techniques
were used to pattern chips capable of magnetic sur-
face trapping. The typical TSMMOT hovered ∼3.5 mm
above the mirror-surface to ensure that surface eﬀects
play no role. Taking the geometry into account [13], the
maximum total intensity within the TSMMOT region is
13 mW/cm2 for Rb and 53 mW/cm2 for Cs. A set of
anti-Helmholtz coils typically produced a magnetic ﬁeld
gradient of about 40 G/cm. Three orthogonal Helmholtz
pairs (“trim coils”), were used to compensate for resid-
ual stray magnetic ﬁelds and to guarantee good overlap
between the two atomic species. The pressure in the
chamber was maintained at ≤ 10−8 Torr. The atoms
were introduced using getter sources placed inside the
vacuum chamber approximately 5 cm from the B-ﬁeld
minimum [14].

To assure full three-dimensional overlap of the two
trapped species, the clouds were imaged with a pair of
CCD cameras aligned on separate axes perpendicular to
the chip. A third high-performance CCD (high linearity)
was used to image the MOTs and measure their spatial
distributions. The shape of the two clouds was that of an
oblate spheroid. The measured waists are noted in Ta-
ble I. The number of trapped atoms was determined by
measuring the ﬂuorescence using two calibrated photo-
detectors combined with narrow-band interference ﬁlters
(bandwidth of about 9 nm) capable of isolating the ﬂuo-
rescence of the individual atomic species. The total num-
ber of trapped atoms was typically 2×107 (9×106) for
87Rb (85Rb) and 1×107 for Cs. This along with our waist
measurements yields peak densities of 4.5×1011 (1011)
atoms/cm3 for Rb and 1.5×1011 atoms/cm3 for Cs.

The amount of collision induced trap-loss depended
critically on the overlap between the two atomic clouds.
During all experiments, the overlap was >∼ 95% by vol-
ume.

FIG. 1: The transient loading signal of 87Rb , both with and
without Cs, as a function of time.

The Cs MOT was imposed onto the Rb MOT by con-
trolled blocking and unblocking of the repump light for
Cs. Fig. 1 shows the loading behavior of the Rb atoms in
the absence and presence of Cs. Losses as large as 78% in
the Rb atom number due to Cs were observed. By ﬁtting
this data to a transient loading rate equation [8, 10], the
heteronuclear loss rate was obtained. The dependence
of trap loss on the total intensity of the Rb trap laser
was measured by keeping the Cs laser intensity and the
number of Cs atoms in the trap constant.

The collisions of atoms in a MOT can be characterized
by the interplay of the loading and loss rate of trapped
atoms. The time-dependent rate equations that model
this process can be written:

dtNRb(t) = τRb − γRbNRb(t) − β

′
Rb−CsnCsNRb(t)

− βRb−RbnRbNRb(t)

(1)

where NRb is the number of Rb atoms, τRb is the trap
ﬁlling rate, γRb is the loss coeﬃcient due to background
collisions, βRb−Rb is the loss rate due to homonuclear
collisions of atoms of one species, and β′
Rb−Cs is the loss
rate due to heteronuclear collisions of atoms between the
two species. The atom number densities, nCs and nRb,
are experimentally deﬁned as the peak number of atoms
divided by the total volume, calculated using the Gaus-
sian 1/e2 waists. Similar to previous treatments in the
literature, we assume that we are in the density-limited
regime [10].

In our experiments, we observe that the trapped atom
number and density for the Cs trap is essentially undis-
turbed by the introduction of Rb atoms into the trap.
Hence in our analysis we treat the Cs density as a con-
stant. By contrast, the number of trapped Rb atoms is
dramatically aﬀected by the presence of Cs atoms in the
trap.

We begin our analysis by assuming that β′

Rb−Cs ≫

βRb−Rb [10, 15]. Eq. 1 can then be written as

dtNRb(t) = τRb − (γRb + β
= τRb − γ

where γ′
Rb is the total loss rate of the mixed trap. For the
parameters of our experiment (chamber pressure etc.),
even in the absence of Cs, βRb−Rb can be neglected and
Eq. 1 becomes

dtNRb(t) = τRb − γRbNRb(t).

Combining Eqs. 2 and 3, β′

Rb−Cs is given by

Fig. 2a shows the measured average losses of Rb due
to Cs. The error bars correspond to standard deviations
in mean value, averaged over repeated experiments per-
formed while keeping experimental parameters constant.
The losses decrease almost linearly with increasing Rb
laser intensity. They also show a distinct isotopic diﬀer-
ence: the losses for 87Rb are greater than those for 85Rb.

This behavior is also seen in the total loss rate which is
shown in Fig. 2b where we plot the total loss rate γRb
(for pure Rb) and the total loss rate γ′
Rb (for Rb+Cs)
on the same graph. We observe no change in γRb (pure
Rb trap) for this intensity regime and see no isotopic dif-
ference. This is consistent with previous work [15, 16].
However, the total loss rate γ′
Rb changed dramatically
in the presence of Cs. Again, the averaged loss rate for
87Rb is consistently higher than for 85Rb. This isotopic
diﬀerence is transferred onto β′
Rb−Cs (Fig. 2c) which was
calculated using Eq. 4.

We note that the absolute values of β′

Rb−Cs have signif-
icant uncertainties (∼ 50%) which arise from systematics
in determining the exact atom number (not included in
our error bars). However, this uncertainty is identical
for each isotope of Rb and hence does not change the
observed isotopic diﬀerence.

We attribute the isotopic diﬀerence to the diﬀerence
in the hyperﬁne ground-state splitting energy of the two
isotopes of Rb [15, 16]. Experimentally, isotopic diﬀer-
ence in trap loss due to ground state hyperﬁne struc-
ture were ﬁrst observed in experiments performed us-
ing pure Rb traps [15]. Phenomenologically, the eﬀect
was explained by noting that the trap depth, which de-
creases with decreasing intensity, is approximately the
same for the two isotopes whereas the ground-state hy-
perﬁne splitting energy is smaller for 85Rb than for 87Rb.
As hyperﬁne changing collisions involving 87Rb release
more energy than those involving 85Rb they cause more
trap loss in the low intensity regime.
In particular, as
a function of the trap laser intensity, βRb−Rb has been
observed to decrease with increasing intensity, reach a
minimum and increase again for higher intensities. For
an ideally aligned MOT, the minimum is reached when
the trap depth equals the hyperﬁne splitting energy. As
the hyperﬁne energies for the two Rb isotopes are dif-
ferent, this minimum occurs at diﬀerent trap intensities.
For a slightly misaligned MOT this minimum is shifted
to higher intensities, but the shape of the curves and the
isotopic diﬀerence is preserved.

We ﬁnd that the behavior of β′

Rb−Cs parallels the

found to be smaller for 85Rb than for 87Rb, as the hy-
perﬁne splitting energy of 85Rb is smaller and therefore
the minimum is reached at lower intensities.

We note that ground-state heteronuclear hyperﬁne
changing collisions have also been observed in mixtures
of sodium and rubidium in our labs [9] however that work
was not performed in the environment of a surface trap.
In summary we presented heteronuclear trap loss mea-
surements in a mixed Rb-Cs TSMMOT. At low inten-
sites, there is an isotopic diﬀerence between 85Rb and
87Rb. Our loss measurements agree well with previous
data obtained for a mixed Rb-Cs trap, however no iso-
topic diﬀerences were reported in that work. With well
overlapped cloud centers, losses up to 78% can be ob-
tained. To our knowledge this is the highest loss reported
for a mixed Rb-Cs MOT.

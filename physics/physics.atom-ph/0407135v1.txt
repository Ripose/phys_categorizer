Single, rf-trapped ions ﬁnd various applications ranging from metrology to quantum computation.

High-resolution interrogation of an extremely weak transition under best observation conditions

requires an ion almost at rest. To avoid line-broadening eﬀects such as the second order Doppler

eﬀect or rf heating in the absence of laser cooling, excess micromotion has to be eliminated as far

as possible. We have tested a novel method to probe the motional state of a conﬁned three-level

ion. Actually, dark resonances observed with two counterpropagating laser beams are very sensitive

to the trapped ion’s velocity. Their contrast increases with reduced micromotion and allows in this

way to control the oscillation amplitude of the stored ion. The inﬂuence of diﬀerent parameters

such as laser linewidth and power has been investigated experimentally and numerically.

INTRODUCTION

Dark resonances in a three-level system are a well-known example of destructive quantum interferences based on the

interaction of two light ﬁelds generating the coherent superposition of two atomic states. Various applications of the

coherent population trapping scheme can be found in atomic physics from high-resolution spectroscopy to sub-recoil

laser-cooling of an atom cloud [1] or EIT-cooling of single ions [2, 3]. Dark resonances have been readily observed in

trapped ions, almost exclusively with copropagating laser beams [4, 5, 6, 7]. In general the observed splitting of the

various Zeeman levels is used for an exact quantitative calibration of the local magnetic ﬁeld.

Single ions conﬁned in radiofrequency traps are ideal candidates for diﬀerent applications of high-resolution spec-

troscopy such as quantum information or frequency standards in the optical domain [8]. They can be stored in the

trap from hours up to months in a quasi interaction-free environment. Laser cooling of the single trapped ion allows

to reach the Doppler cooling limit which is in the mK-range. To eliminate residual Doppler broadening on a given

transition by accessing the Lamb-Dicke regime [9], the ion must be localized to a volume inferior to the cube of the

inverse wavenumber. The ﬂuorescence spectrum is then decomposed in a central carrier and few sidebands separated

by the ion’s motional frequencies. This excellent localisation can only be achieved in the center of the rf trapping ﬁeld

conﬁning the ion, which for this purpose has to be nearly perfectly symmetric. Patch potentials due to asymmetries

or ion creation may distort the created potential and have therefore to be corrected by application of additional direct

voltages on supplementary correction electrodes in all three directions.

In this paper we present an additional and straightforward method for the localisation of an ion in the miniature

trap. We have used coherent population trapping as a tool to minimize the micromotion of the conﬁned ion. Dark

resonances depend ultimately only on the lifetimes of the initial and the ﬁnal state, which in the presented experiment

are both very long-lived. In practice, the very small theoretical linewidth of the dark resonance is broadened by the

linewidth and the power of the applied lasers. These experimental parameters can be very well controlled. The main

∗Electronic address: Martina.Knoop@up.univ-mrs.fr

factor of residual broadening of the observed non-absorbing state is then the velocity distribution of the conﬁned ion

dominated by the micromotion. The study of this phenomenon reveals that the maximum sensitivity to the kinetic

energy state can be reached with counterpropagating laser beams. The proposed technique requires only a single laser

axis, it is based on the fact that the contrast of dark resonances observed in a single ion ﬂuorescence increases with

the degree of immobilisation of the ion. Excess micromotion ”ﬁlls” the dip of the dark resonance in the case where

the laser beams are counterpropagating.

We trap singly-ionized calcium in a miniature radiofrequency trap. The main laser-cooling transition connects the
4S1/2 ground state to the 4P1/2-level at 397 nm. Throughout the manuscript this is called the blue transition (index
B). This upper state has a lifetime of 7 ns and a branching ratio to the metastable 3D3/2-state of about 6%. A closed
laser-cooling cycle therefore requires a repumper laser at 866 nm (red transition (R)) to empty the 3D3/2-state. The
observed dark resonances are the sign of the coherent superposition of the 4S1/2 ground state and the metastable
3D3/2 state with a lifetime of about one second [10, 11]. The level-scheme of the Ca+-ion dressed by the blue photons
is given in the inset of Figure 1.

Our experimental set-up uses a miniature ring trap with an inner diameter of 1.4 mm. The trapping frequency of
12 MHz with an amplitude of about VAC = 300 V is applied to the ring, generating a pseudo-potential well
with a depth of a few eV , allowing the stable conﬁnement of ions for days. Two tip electrodes in the plane of the ring
(x, y) and two larger mesh electrodes along the ring axis (z1, z2), distant by approximately 5 mm from the ring center,
permit corrections of the potential by application of direct voltages. The trapping characteristics of this device are

described in detail elsewhere [12].

The ﬁrst section of this article describes the micromotion generated in the radiofrequency trap, which is the main

source of heating of the conﬁned ions. The existing methods to reduce this eﬀect are very brieﬂy reviewed. We then

introduce the formalism for dark resonances, along with the modeling used to obtain a high degree of control of the

experimental conditions. The last section of this work is devoted to the experimental observation of dark resonances.

The inﬂuence of the main control parameters (laser power, beam geometry and magnetic ﬁeld) will be discussed.

The motion of a trapped ion in an ideal Paul trap is described by the Mathieu equations [13]:

valid for the three directions u = x, y, z. The values of the coeﬃcients au and qu which determine the range of
stable conﬁnement of a particle are deﬁned by the trapping voltage VAC and its frequency Ω/2π, the superimposed
DC-voltage VDC , the radius r0 of the trap as well as the e/m ratio of the trapped ion. To ﬁrst order in au and qu,
the stable solution of equation (1) is

u(t) = Ru cos ωut (1 +

cos Ωt)

qu
2

The motion of the conﬁned ion is composed of the harmonic oscillation at frequencies ωu/2π with amplitude Ru
called ”secular” motion, and the AC-driven ”micromotion” at the frequency of the trapping ﬁeld Ω/2π. In opposition

to the secular motion, micromotion cannot be cooled because it is driven motion. According to Eq.(2), a smaller
secular motion amplitude Ru leads to a reduced contribution of the micromotion. A displacement of the ion from the
center of the trap due to asymmetries in the geometry of the trap and the applied electric ﬁelds, may cause excess

micromotion, blocking the access to the Lamb-Dicke regime. A complete review of origin and consequences of the

micromotion is given in [14].

Three experimental methods allow to control excess micromotion of an ion in a radiofrequency trap. Best results are

obtained by using all of them as the collected information is complementary in the three cases. The control parameter
is in either case the DC-voltage applied on one of the four (x, y, z1, z2) compensation electrodes surrounding the trap.
The most simple approach is the observation of the spatial displacement of a trapped ion as the conﬁning potential is

lowered. Parasite potentials then gain in importance and move the ion out of the trap center. This method uses spatial

detection and is limited to the plane of observation. A more precise mean for the rejection of excess micromotion is

the probing of the ﬂuorescence linewidth of the laser-cooling transition. This proﬁle is diﬃcult to evaluate in terms of

absolute temperature, but gives a good relative control signal of the ion’s kinetic energy when laser powers are ﬁxed.

At a given laser frequency, the half-maximum amplitude of the ﬂuorescence signal on the red-side of the resonance

decreases for better compensation, as the ion becomes colder and its blue transition linewidth narrower. The most

precise observation of the micromotion’s inﬂuence is the measure of the correlation of the emitted ﬂuorescence photons

with the conﬁnement frequency Ω/2π [14]. Actually, the oscillatory motion of the ion causes a frequency modulation

of the laser ﬁeld in the rest frame of the ion, and induces a modulation of the emitted photons at the trapping

frequency Ω/2π. To cancel the micromotion, the amplitude of this modulation signal has to be minimized. Best

compensation results are obtained by the use of diﬀerent laser axes for an access to the diﬀerent projections in space.

The ultimate measurement to determine the degree of localisation of the ion in the trap is of course the detection

of vibrational sidebands in the ﬂuorescence signal. This observation is only possible on a transition whose natural
linewidth is inferior to the ion’s vibrational frequencies ωu. In our case, this must be realized on the ultra-narrow
4S1/2-3D5/2 transition using the quantum jump technique. The motional state of the ion can thus be quantiﬁed in a
precise way [15]. However this method requires a highly stabilized laser to excite the 4S-3D transition and the need

to work on quantum jump statistics for the detection of this dipole-forbidden transition.

In the following we will show how we can use the varying-contrast observation of the coherent population trapping

dip as a probe for the minimisation of the micromotion of the conﬁned particle.

III. FORMALISM AND MODELING

In a three-level system driven by two lasers, coherent superposition of the atomic states coupled by the radiation

ﬁelds may lead to the appearance of a non-absorbing state, when the detunings of the cooling laser (B) and the

repumper (R) are equal. In this case, one of the stationary states
of the atomic system in the Λ conﬁguration
undergoing excitation by two lasers, is a coherent superposition of the ground and metastable states S1/2 and D3/2,
P1/2
which is not coupled to the excited state P1/2 by the atom-laser interaction VL (
= 0). Once in
(cid:10)
this state, the atom can not absorb or scatter photons and the ﬂuorescence disappears. This feature, called dark

resonance, has been used to cool atoms below the recoil limit by velocity selective coherent population trapping [16],

other applications of dark resonances are given in [1].

In the general case, the two transitions are driven by diﬀerent lasers, the non-coupled state then depends on the

relative phase of the lasers like:

It appears from the above equation that the observation of the dark resonances can be used to quantify the motional
state of an ion, and that the highest sensitivity to this motion is obtained for kR =

kB.

To identify the dependance of the dark resonance proﬁle of each experimental parameter (laser linewidth, laser

intensity and detuning, motional state of the ion), we numerically studied the atomic system through the evolution of

its density matrix. The theoretical and numerical studies regarding VSCPT and cooling below the recoil limit [17] on

a symmetric Λ system showed that the full treatment implies the discretisation of the momentum space. This method

requires very long computational time and is not needed for the precision demanded here. Because the frequency

resolution and the natural linewidths of the transitions are in the MHz-range, far above the photon recoil shift, and

because the mechanical eﬀect of light is omitted, we may neglect the operators due to the kinetic energy of the ion

in the density matrix. Using the same approach as in [18], we add the Doppler shift in the laser detuning like in

equation (7). The detunings are then oscillating with the ion in the trap with a velocity deduced from Eq. (2). For
the sake of simplicity, we suppose here that only one secular frequency (ωr) contributes to the Doppler shift:

where the sign of the Doppler shift is deﬁned by the propagation direction of the laser. The displacement a of the
average position of the ion relative to the oscillation amplitude Rr gives rise to excess micromotion. As the natural
widths of the involved atomic transitions are of the same order as the secular oscillation frequency (ΓB/2π = 20.6 MHz,
1 MHz), the ion can not be considered as free and the oscillatory motion of the ion has to be
ΓR/2π = 1.7 MHz, ωr ≃
followed during several periods, until convergence is reached. The laser linewidths ΓLB and ΓLR (FWHM) are taken
into account by a relaxation on coherence. To prevent pumping in a dark state, a minimal magnetic ﬁeld must be

applied and several dark resonances can be observed, corresponding to the diﬀerent Zeeman sub-levels. The density
matrix is solved for the eight Zeeman sublevels of the S1/2, P1/2, D3/2 system.

IV. RESULTS

The experimental setup is like in [19] and in ﬁgure 1, where the case of counterpropagating laser beams is depicted.

The ultrahigh-vacuum vessel containing the miniature trap allows the propagation of the laser beams along an axis

having a 55 degree angle according to the trap’s z-axis. Observation of the ion’s ﬂuorescence is made in the xy-plane

of the trap either spatially resolved by an intensiﬁed CCD or as an integrated signal by a photomultiplier in photon-

counting mode. Laser beams are transported to the trap by single-mode ﬁbers, polarization-maintaining in the case

of the blue laser. Laser polarizations are modiﬁed by means of quarter- and half-waveplates.

Observation of the dark resonances requires identical detuning for both lasers. This can be readily realized by

keeping one laser ﬁxed, while probing the atomic resonance with the other laser. To avoid the inﬂuence of varying
laser-cooling, we ﬁx the blue cooling laser on the red-frequency side of the 4S1/2-4P1/2 transition (approximately at
of the dark resonance as the depth
- 1 to 2 ΓB) and scan the repumper laser at 866 nm. We deﬁne the ”contrast”
of the observed dip divided by the possible total signal if we suppose a roughly Gaussian lineshape.

C

A. Magnetic ﬁeld

To make sure that laser polarization eﬀects do not play a role, the local magnetic ﬁeld has to be controlled in

a rigorous way. We apply a magnetic ﬁeld suﬃcient to deﬁne a quantization axis but small enough to avoid the

splitting of the Zeeman sublevels. In our experimental setup, the local magnetic ﬁeld is controlled by three pairs
of orthogonal Helmholtz coils. The residual −→B -ﬁeld at the position of the ion has been compensated making use of
the Hanle eﬀect. Laser-cooling is carried out on the 4S1/2-4P1/2 transition, while a repumper on the 3D3/2-4P1/2
transition at 866 nm avoids trapping of the ion in the metastable 3D3/2 state. A bias magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 (
1 Gauss)
is applied perpendicularly to the propagation axis of the lasers, the repumping laser being linearly polarized parallel
to this ﬁeld. If the total magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to ~B0, the ion is pumped in the 3D3/2, mF =
3/2 states, which
are not coupled to the laser, making the ﬂuorescence disappear. Any residual magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to ~B0
mixes these dark states with the 3D3/2, mF =
1/2 states and ﬂuorescence is then observed again. If the repumping
laser polarisation is purely linear, the observed ﬂuorescence can be reduced to zero when the applied magnetic ﬁeld

±

±

≈

exactly compensates the local ﬁeld (see ﬁgure 2). This procedure is carried out for all three axis of the magnetic ﬁeld,

changing the quantization axis and the corresponding laser polarizations. The method, based on optical pumping in

a dark state, is independent on the linewidth and detuning of the lasers, if we assume that the bias magnetic ﬁeld is

small enough to keep the splitting of the Zeeman sublevels comparable to the excitation linewidth of the lasers. As a

consequence, this technique is not sensitive to the motion of the ion and presents the advantage of being useable for

a single ion as well as for an ion cloud.

B. Laser intensity

Due to the light-shift the observed dark resonances depend on the applied laser intensities. In particular, higher

laser intensity at 397 nm splits the atomic levels to a greater extent. The ﬁve graphs in ﬁgure 3 have been taken with
increasing laser power, starting from 20 µW which corresponds to a Rabi frequency of 15 ΓB. The digging of the dark
resonance dip with the applied blue laser power follows a saturation curve as represented in the inset of the ﬁgure.
For laser intensities higher than 30 ΓB the transition is largely saturated, and the minimum of the dark resonance
dip has been reached.

We have also checked the inﬂuence of the red probe laser intensity while keeping the blue laser power ﬁxed.

6

(9a)

(9b)

As expected, this only broadens the scanned atomic transition, without deepening the dark resonance, as power

broadening eﬀects prevail.

C. Micromotion

For counterpropagating laser beams, dark resonances have merely be observed in our experiment when the ion is

well localized, which means that part of the excess micromotion has already been eliminated by a rough compensation

of patch potentials. Actually, simulations show the dependence of the contrast of the dark resonance on the degree

of localisation of the ion. The smaller the ion’s amplitude of motion, the deeper the observed dark resonance. In

ﬁgure 4 several graphs show the changing contrast in the observation of a dark resonance, as a function of modiﬁed

compensation voltages applied on the correction electrodes. We have made sure, that the additional static voltages

do not push the ion out of the laser beams. The inset shows the contrast

of the dark resonance versus the applied

compensation voltage and a maximum can be unambiguously distinguished. We have veriﬁed that this maximum

C

corresponds to a reduced spectral linewidth for a scan of the blue laser. The blue linewidth represents an estimate

of the ion’s kinetic energy when approximated by a Doppler proﬁle. It cannot be taken as an absolute measure as it

depends strongly on the applied (blue) laser intensity, however it is a good relative indication of the kinetic energy

state of the ion. Compensation parameters have been tested on all four correction electrodes, resulting in the best

localisation of a single ion.

D. Laser beam geometry

We have used the observed dark resonances to collect information about the motional state of the ion using

equation (7). If we take into account experimental parameters as the laser power or spectral width, the collapse of the

where a) denotes the case of copropagating laser beams, while b) stands for counterpropagating laser beams.
In the case of a Ca+-ion kB ≈

2 kR, which means that the velocity class participating in the dark resonance in
the copropagating laser beam conﬁguration is three times larger than in the case of counterpropagating laser beams.

For a laser-cooled ion oscillating in the trap and with observation times which are at least two orders of magnitude

higher than the oscillation timescale, the observed signal is smeared out in the case of counterpropagating laser beams

leading to a lower contrast as can be seen on the computed graphs in ﬁgure 5.

The geometry of counterpropagating cooling laser beams in our experiment allows to use the contrast of the observed

dark resonances as a tool for the minimization of the micromotion. We have also worked with the alternative beam

geometry where both lasers enter the trap from the same direction. In this conﬁguration, dark resonances can be

observed in almost any case, even with a small ion cloud. As example, ﬁgure 6 shows the ﬂuorescence spectrum of

geometry we have plotted the dark resonance contrast

three ions with copropagating laser beams. To evidence the diﬀerence between co- and counterpropagating laser beam
as a function of the linewidth of the 4S1/2-4P1/2 transition
in ﬁgure 7. Again, the blue transition linewidth gives a relative indication of the degree of localisation of the trapped

C

ion, the smaller it is, the closer the ion is assigned to the center of the trap. The dispersion of the points in ﬁgure

7 is due to slightly diﬀerent levels of probe and cooling laser intensity. Nevertheless the general tendency is clearly

visible: while dark resonances could not be observed at all for the counterpropagating geometry unless a certain level

of localization has been reached, the copropagating geometry allows the observation of dark resonances for much

hotter ions and even for small ion clouds. We have been able to deepen the dark resonance dip almost down the

background light level, reﬂecting an excellent localisation of the ion.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have presented a novel approach to reduce the micromotion of an ion conﬁned in a miniature

electrodynamic trap. We use the contrast of the dark resonances observed with two counterpropagating laser beams

to collect informations about the motional state of the ion. Numerical simulations and experiments have shown that

this contrast is very sensitive to the localisation of the ion, while a larger oscillation amplitude smears out the coherent

population trapping eﬀect. Observation of ﬂuorescence is made on time bins which are long compared to the inverse

motional frequencies of the ion. On this timescale, the oscillation amplitudes along the three directions are coupled

in the trap. As a consequence, a single laser propagation axis is suﬃcient. Furthermore, only the lasers for cooling

and detection of the ion are necessary for the implementation of the proposed technique, which avoids the use of a

highly-stabilized laser on the very weak and narrow 4S-3D transition. In a more general way, the proposed method

can be applied to any three-level ion having a Λ energy scheme, keeping in mind that the highest sensitivity is reached
for kB = kR.

FIG. 3: Dark resonances observed with counterpropagating laser beams. The graph shows the inﬂuence of the laser power on

the level splitting, the oﬀset of the curves is due to the varying laser power. The applied blue laser powers are marked on the

right-hand side of the curves, where the lowest value corresponds to about 15 Γ while the highest power is equivalent to 30Γ.

The inset shows the increasing contrast of the dark resonance with higher laser power.

via Above Threshold Ionization and Stimulated
Recombination

Abstract. Fully quantum treatment explicitly presents the high harmonic generation
as a three-stage process: above threshold ionization (ATI) is followed by the continuum
electron propagation in a laser ﬁeld and subsequent stimulated recombination back
into the initial state. The contributions of all ATI channels add up coherently. All
three stages of the process are described by simple, mostly analytical expressions.
A very good quantitative agreement with the previous calculations on the harmonic
generation by H− ion is demonstrated, thus supplementing the conceptual signiﬁcance
of the theory with its practical eﬃciency.

Under the inﬂuence of an intensive electromagnetic ﬁeld an atom can emit electrons
and photons. The number of photons absorbed from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst process
generally exceeds the minimum necessary for ionization, i.e.
the photoelectrons are
characterized by their distribution over above threshold ionization (ATI) channels. The
photon production corresponds to the harmonics generation (HG) for the incident
(monochromatic) laser radiation. Both ATI and HG are capable of populating the
channels with remarkably high energy, as has recently been registered in experiments
(see, e.g., L.’Huillier et al 1991, Macklin et al 1993, Schafer et al 1993) and tackled by
the theory.

An idea that the two processes referred above are interrelated has been articulated
quite long ago. Since in the HG process an active electron ends up in the initial bound
state, it is appealing to represent it as ionization followed by recombination. This
mechanism presumes a strong interaction between the emitted electron and the core
that is omitted in the standard Keldysh (1964) model of multiphoton ionization. The
importance of this interaction for a variety of processes was ﬁrst pointed out by Kuchiev

(1987), who predicted several phenomena for which the electron-core interaction plays
a crucial role. The related mechanism was named “atomic antenna”.

Speciﬁcally for HG, the simple relation between this process and ATI was suggested
by Eberly et al (1989) but proved to be non-realistic, see below. The hybrid classi-
cal-quantum model due to Corkum (1993) casts HG as a three-step process: tunneling
ionization and subsequent propagation in the continuum is followed by recombination.
This intuitive model has inﬂuenced many research in experiment and theory. The
simplicity of the model is due to some drastic presumptions. Usually it is emphasized
that the intermediate electron propagation in the laser ﬁeld is described by the Corkum
(1993) model classically. Probably less attention is paid to the fact that neither
the tunneling ionization through the time-dependent barrier, nor the laser-stimulated
recombination receive a genuine quantum treatment as well. Being successfully applied
to the comparison with some experimental data, the model resorts to such a loosely
deﬁned free parameter as the ’transverse spread of the electron wave function’. From the
conceptual side the Corkum (1993) model does not directly appeal to ATI process just
because the discrete ATI channels do not appear within the classical framework. The
subsequent developments were based on more sophisticated theory and led to important
advancements (Lewenstein et al 1994, Becker et al 1994), but apparently abandoned
the perspective to establish a quantitative relation between ATI and HG. The ATI
characteristics merely do not emerge in the papers devoted to HG theory, with few
exceptions (Zaretskii and Nersesov, 1996).

i.e.

The principal objective of the present study is to derive a fully quantum formulation
for the HG amplitude in terms of the ATI amplitude and amplitude of electron
stimulated recombination (SR) in the laser ﬁeld.
Importantly, all the amplitudes
no oﬀ-energy-shell entities appear. This circumstance adds to
are physical,
the conceptual appeal of the present theory its signiﬁcance as a true working tool.
We successfully test its eﬃciency by quantitative comparison with the benchmark
calculations by Becker et al (1994) for HG by H− ion.
In the broader perspective
it should be emphasized that our theoretical technique is directly applicable to other
processes of current key interest, such as multiple ionization by laser radiation or
photoelectron rescattering.

where VF (r, t) = F
r cos ωt is the interaction between the active electron and the laser
wave with the electric ﬁeld amplitude strength F in the dipole-length gauge. Eq.(3)
implies that the high harmonic Ω is emitted after the absorption of several low-frequency
t′. Strictly speaking, there are ’time-reversed’ processes in which the
laser quanta, t
radiation of the high harmonic precedes the absorption of some laser quanta. However,
for a large number of the quanta absorbed such a mechanism is suppressed and is
therefore omitted in (3) together with the continuum-continuum transitions (the latter
approximation is a rather standard one, see, e.g., Lewenstein et al (1994)).

The next basic approximation is to discard the eﬀect of the atomic core potential Va

Similar assumption underlies the Keldysh (1964) model, whose recent adiabatic
modiﬁcation (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b, Kuchiev and Ostrovsky 1998) gives fully
reliable quantitative results for photodetachment. A useful extension of the Keldysh
model accounts for the Coulomb electron-core interaction (Ammosov et al 1986, Krainov
1997).

Generally the correct description of the high Fourier components dN represents a
formidable theoretical task.
Its numerical implementation via solving the non-stati-
onary Schr¨odinger equation requires both a supercomputer and exceptional eﬀort. In
the representation (3) the diﬃculty lies in the strong variation of the integrand as a
function of the time variables t, t′. The crucial simpliﬁcation is gained by using the
factorization technique Kuchiev (1995) which allows us to disentangle the integration
variables at a price of introducing an extra summation; very importantly, this summation
is physically meaningful as it corresponds to the contributions of diﬀerent ATI channels.
The integration over the intermediate momenta q [coming from (4)] is carried out
in closed form. Some minor additional approximations [see, for instance, Eq.(11)
below; the detailed derivation is to be published elsewhere] brings us to the appealing

In the right hand side of (9) the index m is implicit. It enters via the absolute value of
the ﬁnal electron momentum p which is subject to the energy conservation constraint.
Namely, the absolute value of p is given by the right hand side of the formula (7),
where F 2/(4ω2) is the electron quiver energy in the laser ﬁeld. This shows that the
vector Km entering the representation (6) of HG amplitude component is exactly the
physical electron translational momentum in the m-th ATI channel, but with the speciﬁc
directions (8).

From the Volkov state Φp the electron can recombine back to the bound state Φa

One readily notices that the integrand in (6) bears a striking resemblance to
the product of the integrands in (9) and (10). However, the complete separation of
integrations in t and t′ variables is prevented by the factor 1/R(t, t′) stemming from the
chain of equations

The latter approximation is applicable provided F/ω2 exceeds the typical dimensions
of localization of the active electron in the initial state Φa, that holds in most practical
situations. Classically R(t, t′) gives the distance between the electron positions at the
moments t and t′ due to electron wiggling in the laser ﬁeld. 1/R could be named an
expansion factor since in the absence of the laser ﬁeld it describes conventional decrease
of the amplitude in a spherical wave as it expands in 3D space. When the laser ﬁeld is
operative, the form of the expansion factor is drastically modiﬁed according to Eq.(11).
Hence the interpretation of the expression (6) is that the electron ﬁrst is transferred to
the m-th ATI channel, then propagates in space under the inﬂuence of the laser wave
and ﬁnally recombines to the initial state emitting the photon with the frequency Ω.
The contributions of all paths labeled by m add up coherently as shown by Eq.(5).

Following the factorization technique (Kuchiev 1995) we simplify Eq.(6) further on
by performing the t′ integration by the saddle point method. This is justiﬁed since the
integrand in (6) contains a large phase factor exp [iS(t′)] with the classical action S(t)

Now it is worthwhile to comment more on the physics of HG as implemented in
Eq.(16). On the ﬁrst stage of the three-step process the electron absorbs m laser photons
with the amplitude Am µ. In order to contribute to HG the photoelectron has to return
to the parent atomic core where SR is solely possible. The amplitude of return is
described by the expansion factor 1/R. At the third step the electron collides with the
m photons from the laser ﬁeld and emitting the single
core virtually absorbing N
high-frequency quantum Ω as it recombines to the bound state. This SR process has
the amplitude CN m. The summation over m in the total amplitude dN (16) takes into
account interference of the transitions via diﬀerent intermediate ATI channels.

−

The nontrivial point is the probability for the ATI electron to return to the core.
Intuitively, one could anticipate that such a process is suppressed, because the most
natural behavior for the electron would be simply to leave the atom. The proper
description of the suppression plays substantial role in the theory. According to the
physical image of the ATI process worked out in the adiabatic approach (Gribakin and
Kuchiev1997a,b), after tunneling through the time-dependent barrier the ATI electron
emerges from under the barrier at some point which is well separated from the core. As
a result this point becomes the source of an expanding spherical wave. This occurs twice
per each cycle of the laser ﬁeld, at the two moments of time t′
mµ when the source-points
lie up and down the ﬁeld F from the core. The interference of the two spherical waves
originating from the two diﬀerent source-points results in non-trivial patterns in the
angular ATI photoelectron distributions obtained from (14)-(15) (Gribakin and Kuchiev
1997a,b, Kuchiev and Ostrovsky 1998) in agreement with the available theoretical and
experimental data. The probability for the ATI electron to return to the core from
the source-point is governed by the expansion factor 1/R and by the direction of
propagation. At each of the moments t′
mµ only one of the two possible directions of
Km, labeled in (5) by σ =
1, results in the electron eventually approaching the core.
For the opposite direction of Km the electron recedes from the core and does not come

±

7

(19)

back. In other words, for each direction of Km only one of the two saddle points t′
mµ
contributes to HG. Since both values of σ give identical contributions, summation over
σ simply gives an extra factor of 2 in (16).

The practical calculations of BN m µ or CN m can be conveniently performed using
the Fourier transform of the bound state wave function φa. After that one has to carry
out a single numerical integration over the ﬁnite interval of time t, or, alternatively, to
resort to the saddle-point method that provides purely analytical formulae.

Based on physical arguments, we extend the summation in (16) only over open
ATI channels with the real values of Km. We present the rates of generating the N-th
harmonic radiation

as introduced by Becker et al (1994) (and denoted by these authors as dRN /dΩK); c is
the velocity of light. Some typical results for the HG by H− ion in the ω = 0.0043 laser
ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 1 for the smallest and largest ﬁeld intensities considered in the
paper by Becker et al (1994). We take the binding energy corresponding to that of H−
(κ = 0.2354), but replace the true value Aa = 0.75 (Radzig and Smirnov 1985) by unity
since this corresponds to the zero-range potential model used by Becker et al (1994).
For the real H− ion the results shown in Fig.1 are to be scaled by a factor A4
aNe, where
Ne = 2 accounts for the presence of two active electrons in H−.

The HG spectrum is known to consist generally of the initial rapid decrease, the
plateau domain and the rapid fall-oﬀ region. The present theory is designed to describe
the high HG but not the initial decrease (which in the case considered is noticeable only
for one or two lowest harmonics). On the large-N side our results employing Eq.(17)
coincide with those obtained by Becker et al (1994) within the plot scale. The deviations
increase as N decreases, albeit remarkably the structures in N-dependence of the rates
are well reproduced. The approximation (18) somewhat overestimates HG rate, but still
retains the structure, though smoothed.

In the summation over ATI channels (i.e. over m) the coherence is very important,
since the large number of terms is comparable in modulus, but have rapidly varying
phases. Many ATI channels contribute to HG for each N (contrary to tentative
conclusion by Eberly et al (1989)).

Although the length gauge is known to be superior for the description of ATI within
the adiabatic approximation (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a), the situation is not that
straightforward for the high-energy photon. Therefore our calculations were reiterated
with replacement of the ˆdǫ operator in (17) by its dipole-velocity counterpart. The
agreement between the two forms proves to be very good, see Fig. 1.

As a summary, the three-step mechanism of the harmonic generation is ultimately

is quantitatively reliable and easy to apply. It gives an important physical insight being
a particular realization of the general atomic antenna mechanism.

Abstract. We present a semiclassical S-matrix study of inelastic collinear
electron-hydrogen scattering. A simple way to extract all necessary information
from the deﬂection function alone without having to compute the stability matrix
is described. This includes the determination of the relevant Maslov indices.
Results of singlet and triplet cross sections for excitation and ionization are
reported. The diﬀerent levels of approximation – classical, semiclassical, and
uniform semiclassical – are compared among each other and to the full quantum
result.

1. Introduction

Semiclassical scattering theory was formulated almost 40 years ago for potential
scattering in terms of WKB-phaseshifts [1]. Ten years later, a multidimensional
formulation appeared, derived from the Feynman path integral [2]. Based on a similar
derivation Miller developed at about the same time his ’classical S-matrix’ which
extended Pechukas’ multidimensional semiclassical S-matrix for potential scattering
to inelastic scattering [3, 4, 5]. These semiclassical concepts have been mostly applied
to molecular problems, and in a parallel development by Balian and Bloch [6] to
condensed matter problems, i.e. to short range interactions.

Only recently, scattering involving long range (Coulomb) forces has been
studied using semiclassical S-matrix techniques, in particular potential scattering [7],
ionization of atoms near the threshold [8, 9] and chaotic scattering below the ionization
threshold [10]. The latter problem has also been studied purely classically [11] and
semiclassically within a periodic orbit approach [12].

While there is a substantial body of work on classical collisions with Coulomb
forces using the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo Method (CTMC) almost no
semiclassical studies exist. This fact together with the remarkable success of
CTMC methods have motivated our semiclassical investigation of inelastic Coulomb
scattering. To carry out an explorative study in the full (12) dimensional phase space
of three interacting particles is prohibitively expensive. Instead, we restrict ourselves
to collinear scattering, i.e. all three particles are located on a line with the nucleus
in between the two electrons. This collision conﬁguration was proven to contain the
essential physics for ionization near the threshold [8, 13, 14] and it ﬁts well into the
context of classical mechanics since the collinear phase space is the consequence of a

stable partial ﬁxed point at the interelectronic angle θ12 = 180◦ [14]. Moreover, it is
exactly the setting of Miller’s approach for molecular reactive scattering.

For the theoretical development of scattering concepts another Hamiltonian of
only two degrees of freedom has been established in the literature, the s-wave model
[15]. Formally, this model Hamiltonian is obtained by averaging the angular degrees
of freedom and retaining only the zeroth order of the respective multipole expansions.
The resulting electron-electron interaction is limited to the line r1 = r2, where the ri
are the electron-nucleus distances, and the potential is not diﬀerentiable along the line
r1 = r2. This is not very important for the quantum mechanical treatment, however,
it aﬀects the classical mechanics drastically. Indeed, it has been found that the s-wave
Hamiltonian leads to a threshold law for ionization very diﬀerent from the one resulting
from the collinear and the full Hamiltonian (which both lead to the same threshold
law) [16]. Since it is desirable for a comparison of semiclassical with quantum results
that the underlying classical mechanics does not lead to qualitative diﬀerent physics
we have chosen to work with the collinear Hamiltonian. For this collisional system we
will obtain and compare the classical, the quantum and the primitive and uniformized
semiclassical result. For the semiclassical calculations the collinear Hamiltonian was
amended by the so called Langer correction, introduced by Langer [17] to overcome
inconsistencies with the semiclassical quantization in spherical (or more generally non-
cartesian) coordinates.

As a side product of this study we give a rule how to obtain the correct Maslov
indices for a two-dimensional collision system directly from the deﬂection function
without the stability matrix. This does not only make the semiclassical calculation
much more transparent it also considerably reduces the numerical eﬀort since one
can avoid to compute the stability matrix and nevertheless one obtains the full
semiclassical result.

The plan of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we introduce the Hamiltonian and
the basic semiclassical formulation of the S-matrix in terms of classical trajectories.
We will discuss a typical S-matrix S(E) at ﬁxed total energy E and illustrate a simple
way to determine the relevant (relative) Maslov phases.
In section 3 semiclassical
excitation and ionization probabilities are compared to quantum results for singlet and
triplet symmetry. The spin averaged probabilities are also compared to the classical
results. In section 4 we will go one step further and uniformize the semiclassical S-
matrix, the corresponding scattering probabilities will be presented. We conclude the
paper with section 5 where we try to assess how useful semiclassical scattering theory
is for Coulomb potentials.

For collinear collisions we have only one ’observable’ after the collision, namely the
state with quantum number n, to which the target electron was excited through the
collision. If its initial quantum number before the collision was n′, we may write the
probability at total energy E as

Pn,n′ (E) = |hn|S|n′i|2

with the S-matrix

S = lim

t→ ∞
→−∞

t′

eiHf te−iH(t−t′)e−iHit′

.

(3)

(4)

Generally, we use the prime to distinguish initial from ﬁnal state variables. The
Hamiltonians Hi and Hf represent the scattering system before and after the
interaction and do not need to be identical (e.g.
in the case of a rearrangement
collision). The initial energy of the projectile electron is given by

ǫ′ = E − ˜ǫ′

(5)

where ˜ǫ′ is the energy of the bound electron and E the total energy of the system.
In the same way the ﬁnal energy of the free electron is ﬁxed. However, apart from
excitation, ionization can also occur for E > 0 in which case |ni is simply replaced by
by a free momentum state |pi. This is possible since the complicated asymptotics of
three free charged particles in the continuum is contained in the S-matrix.

2.2. The semiclassical expression for the S-matrix

Semiclassically, the S-matrix may be expressed as

Sn,n′(E) = Xj qP (j)

n,n′ (E) eiΦj −i π

2 νj ,

(6)

where the sum is over all classical trajectories j which connect the initial state n′ and
the ﬁnal ’state’ n with a respective probability of P (j)
n,n′(E). The classical probability
P (j)
n,n′(E) is given by

P (j)
n,n′(E) = P (j)

,

(7)

see [9] where also an expression for the normalization constant N is given. Note, that
due to the relation (5) derivatives of ǫ and ˜ǫ with respect to n or R′ diﬀer only by a
sign. From now on we denote the coordinates of the initially free electron by capital
letters and those of the initially bound electron by small letters. If the projectile is
bound after the collision we will call this an ’exchange process’, otherwise we speak of
’excitation’ (the initially bound electron remains bound) or ionization (both electrons
have positive energies). The deﬂection function ǫ(R′) has to be calculated numerically,
as described in the next section. The phase Φj is the collisional action [18] given by

Φj (P, n; P ′, n′) = −Z dt (cid:16)q ˙n + R ˙P(cid:17)

(8)

with the angle variable q. The Maslov index νj counts the number of caustics
along each trajectory.
’State’ refers in the present context to integrable motion for
asymptotic times t → ±∞, characterized by constant actions, J ′ = 2π¯h(n′ + 1/2).
The (free) projectile represents trivially integrable motion and can be characterized by

its momentum P ′. In our case, each particle has only one degree of freedom. Hence,
instead of the action J ′ we may use the energy ˜ǫ′ for a unique determination of the
initial bound state. In the next sections we describe how we calculated the deﬂection
function, the collisional action and the Maslov index.

2.2.1. Scattering trajectories and the deﬂection function The crucial object for the
determination of (semi-)classical scattering probabilities is the deﬂection function
ǫ(R′) where ǫ is the ﬁnal energy of the projectile electron as a function of its initial
position R0 + R′. Each trajectory is started with the bound electron at an arbitrary
but ﬁxed phase space point on the degenerate Kepler ellipse with energy ˜ǫ′ = −1/2
a.u.. The initial position of the projectile electron is changed according to R′, but
always at asymptotic distances (we take R0 = 1000 a.u.), and its momentum is ﬁxed
by energy conservation to P ′ = [2(E − ˜ǫ′)]1/2. The trajectories are propagated as a
function of time with a symplectic integrator [19] and ǫ = ǫ(t → ∞) is in practice
evaluated at a time t when

d ln|ǫ|/dt < δ

(9)

where δ determines the desired accuracy of the result. Typical trajectories are shown
in ﬁgure 1, their initial conditions are marked in the deﬂection function of ﬁgure 2.

In the present (and generic) case of a two-body potential that is bounded from
below the deﬂection function must have maxima and minima according to the largest
and smallest energy exchange possible limited by the minimum of the two-body
potential. The deﬂection function can only be monotonic if the two-body potential is
unbounded from below as in the case of the pure (homogeneous) Coulomb potential

marks ionizing initial conditions and separates the exchange region (ǫ < 0) from
the excitation region (ǫ > E), where ǫ is the energy of the projectile after the
collision.

without Langer correction (compare, e.g., ﬁgure 1 of [8]). This qualitative diﬀerence
implies another important consequence: For higher total energies E the deﬂection
function is pushed upwards. Although energetically allowed, for E > 1 a.u. the
exchange-branch vanishes as can be seen from ﬁgure 3. As we will see later this
has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on semiclassical excitation and ionization probabilities.

2.2.2. The form of the collisional action The collisional action Φj along the
trajectory j in (6) has some special properties which result from the form of the
S-matrix (4). The asymptotically constant states are represented by a constant action
J or quantum number n and a constant momentum P for bound and free degrees of
freedom respectively. Hence, in the asymptotic integrable situation with ˙n = ˙P = 0
before and after the collision no action Φj is accumulated and the collisional action has
a well deﬁned value irrespectively of the actual propagation time in the asymptotic
regions. This is evident from (8) which is, however, not suitable for a numerical
realization of the collision. The scattering process is much easier followed in coordinate
space, and more speciﬁcally for our collinear case, in radial coordinates.
In the
following, we will describe how to extract the action according to (8) from such a
calculation in radial coordinates (position r and momentum p for the target electron,
R and P for the projectile electron). The discussion refers to excitation processes
to keep the notation simple but the result (13) holds also for the other cases. The

collisional action Φ can be expressed through the action in coordinate space ˜Φ by [3]
(10)

Φ(P, n; P ′, n′) = ˜Φ(P, r; P ′, r′) + F2(r′, n′) − F2(r, n),

Here, ri denotes an inner turning point of an electron with energy ǫ(n) in the potential

of the bound electron. Partial integration of (11) transforms to momentum space and
yields a simple expression for the collisional action in terms of spatial coordinates:

Note, that t′
i and ti refer to times where the bound electron is at an inner turning
point and the generator F2 vanishes. Phases determined according to (13) may still
diﬀer for the same path depending on its time of termination. However, the diﬀerence
can only amount to integer multiples of the (quantized !) action

J = I p dr = 2π(cid:18)n +

(14)

of the bound electron with ǫ < 0. Multiples of 2π for each revolution do not change
the value of the S-matrix and the factor 2π
2 is compensated by the Maslov index. In

Inelastic semiclassical Coulomb scattering

7

the case of an ionizing trajectory the action must be corrected for the logarithmic
phase accumulated in Coulomb potentials [18].

Summarizing this analysis, we ﬁx the (in principle arbitrary) starting point of
the trajectory to be an inner turning point (r′
i|p′ = 0, ˙p′ > 0) which completes the
initial condition for the propagation of trajectories described in section 2.2.1.
In
order to obtain the correct collisional action (8) in the form (13) we also terminate a
trajectory at an inner turning point ri after the collision such that Φ is a continuous
function of the initial position R′. Although this is not necessary for the primitive
semiclassical scattering probability which is only sensitive to phase diﬀerences up
to multiples of J as mentioned above, the absolute phase diﬀerence is needed for a
uniformized semiclassical expression to be discussed later.

2.3. Maslov indices

In position space the determination of the Maslov index
2.3.1. Numerical procedure
is rather simple for an ordinary Hamiltonian with kinetic energy as in (2). According
to Morse’s theorem the Maslov index is equal to the number of conjugate points along
the trajectory. A conjugate point in coordinate space is deﬁned by (f degrees of
freedom, (qi, pi) a pair of conjugate variables)

det (Mqp) = det


∂ (q1, . . . , qf )
f(cid:17)
1, . . . , p′

∂(cid:16)p′


 = 0.

(15)

The matrix Mqp is the upper right part of the stability or monodromy matrix which
is deﬁned by

δ~p(t)(cid:19) ≡ M (t)(cid:18)δ~q(0)
(cid:18)δ~q(t)
δ~p(0)(cid:19) .

(16)

In general, the Maslov index νj in (6) must be computed in the same representation
as the action. In our case this is the momentum representation in (13). However,
the Maslov index in momentum space is not simply the number of conjugate points
in momentum space where det (Mpq) = 0. Morse’s theorem relies on the fact that
in position space the mass tensor Bij = ∂2H/∂pi∂pj is positive deﬁnite. This is not
necessarily true for Dij = ∂2H/∂qi∂qj which is the equivalent of the mass tensor in
momentum space. How to obtain the correct Maslov index from the number of zeros of
det (Mpq) = 0 is described in [20], a review about the Maslov index and its geometrical
interpretation is given in [21].

2.3.2. Phenomenological approach for two degrees of freedom For two degrees of
freedom, one can extract the scattering probability directly from the deﬂection
function without having to compute the stability matrix and its determinant explicitly
[8].
In view of this simpliﬁcation it would be desirable to determine the Maslov
indices also directly from the deﬂection function avoiding the complicated procedure
described in the previous section. This is indeed possible since one needs only the
correct diﬀerence of Maslov indices for a semiclassical scattering amplitude.

A little thought reveals that trajectories starting from branches in the deﬂection
function of ﬁgure 2 separated by an extremum diﬀer by one conjugate point. This
implies that their respective Maslov indices diﬀer by ∆ν = 1. For this reason it is
convenient to divide the deﬂection function in diﬀerent branches, separated by an

Inelastic semiclassical Coulomb scattering

8

extremum. Trajectories of one branch have the same Maslov index. Since there are
two extrema we need only two Maslov indices, ν1 = 1 and ν2 = 2. The relevance
of just two values of Maslov indices (1, 2) can be traced to the fact that almost all
conjugate points are trivial in the sense that they belong to turning points of bound
two-body motion.

We can assign the larger index ν2 = 2 to the trajectories which have passed one
more conjugate point than the others. As it is almost evident from their topology,
these are the trajectories with dǫ/dR′ > 0 shown in the upper row of ﬁgure 1. (They
also have a larger collisional action Φj). The two non-trivial conjugate points for these
trajectories compared to the single conjugate point for orbits with initial conditions
corresponding to dǫ/dR′ < 0 can be understood looking at the ionizing trajectories (b)
and (e) of each branch in ﬁgure 1. Trajectories from both branches have in common
the turning point for the projectile electron (P = 0). For trajectories of the lower row
all other turning points belong to complete two-body revolutions of a bound electron
and may be regarded as trivial conjugate points. However, for the trajectories from
the upper row there is one additional turning point (see, e.g., ﬁgure 1(b)) which cannot
be absorbed by a complete two-body revolution. It is the source for the additional
Maslov phase.

We ﬁnally remark that dǫ/dR′ > 0 is equivalent to dn/d¯q < 0 of [25] leading to

the same result as our considerations illustrated above.

3. Semiclassical scattering probabilities

Taking into account the Pauli principle for the indistinguishable electrons leads to
diﬀerent excitation probabilities for singlet and triplet,

ǫ (E) = | Sǫ,ǫ′(E) + SE−ǫ,ǫ′(E)|2
P +
ǫ (E) = | Sǫ,ǫ′(E) − SE−ǫ,ǫ′(E)|2 ,
P −

(17)

where the probabilities are symmetrized a posteriori (see [24]). Here, Sǫ,ǫ′ denotes
the S-matrix for the excitation branch, calculated according to (6), while SE−ǫ,ǫ′
represents the exchange processes, at a ﬁxed energy ǫ < 0, respectively.

Ionization probabilities are obtained by integrating the diﬀerential probabilities
over the relevant energy range which is due to the symmetrization (17) reduced to
E/2:

3.1. Ionization and excitation for singlet and triplet symmetry

We begin with the ionization probabilities since they illustrate most clearly the
eﬀect of the vanishing exchange branch for higher energies as illustrated in ﬁgure 3.
The semiclassical result for the Langer Hamiltonian (2) shows the eﬀect of the
vanishing exchange branch in the deﬂection function ﬁgure 3 which leads to merging
P ± probabilities at a ﬁnite energy E, in clear discrepancy to the quantum result,
see ﬁgure 4. Moreover, the extrema in the deﬂection function lead to the sharp
structures below E = 1 a.u.. The same is true for the excitation probabilities where
a discontinuity appears below E = 1 a.u.
(ﬁgure 5). Note also that due to the

than unity, as it is the case for the n = 1 channel.

Singlet and triplet excitation probabilities represent the most diﬀerential
scattering information for the present collisional system. Hence, the strongest
deviations of the semiclassical results from the quantum values can be expected. Most
experiments do not resolve the spin states and measure a spin-averaged signal. In our

Figure 6 shows averaged ionization probabilities. They are very similar to each
other, and indeed, the classical result is not much worse than the semiclassical result.
In ﬁgure 7 we present the averaged excitation probabilities. Again, on can see the
discontinuity resulting from the extrema in the deﬂection function. As for ionization,
the spin averaged semiclassical probabilities (ﬁgure 7b) are rather similar to the
classical ones (ﬁgure 7a), in particular the discontinuity is of the same magnitude
as in the classical case and considerably more localized in energy than in the non-
averaged quantities of ﬁgure 5.

Clearly, the discontinuities are an artefact of the semiclassical approximation.
More precisely, they are a result of the ﬁnite depth of the two-body potential in the
Langer corrected Hamiltonian (2). Around the extrema of the deﬂection function
the condition of isolated stationary points, necessary to apply the stationary phase
approximation which leads to (6), is not fulﬁlled. Rather, one has to formulate a
uniform approximation which can handle the coalescence of two stationary phase
points.

4. Uniformized scattering probabilities

We follow an approach by Chester et. al. [23]. The explicit expression for the uniform
S-matrix goes back to Connor and Marcus [22] who obtained for two coalescing

of ﬁgure 8 the discontinuities of the non-uniform results are indeed smoothed in
comparison with ﬁgure 5. However, the overall agreement with the quantum
probabilities is worse than in the non-uniform approximation. A possible explanation
could lie in the construction of the uniform approximation. It works with an integral
representation of the S-matrix, where the oscillating phase (the action) is mapped
onto a cubic polynomial. As a result, the uniformization works best, if the deﬂection

function can be described as a quadratic function around the extremum. Looking at
ﬁgure 2 one sees that this is true only in a very small neighborhood of the extrema
because the deﬂection function is strongly asymmetric around these points. We also
applied a uniform approximation derived by Miller [4] which gave almost identical
results.

Finally, for the sake of completeness, the spin averaged uniform probabilities
are shown in ﬁgure 9. As can be seen, the discontinuities have vanished almost
completely. However, the general agreement with quantum mechanics is worse than for
the standard semiclassical calculations, similarly as for the symmetrized probabilities.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we have described inelastic Coulomb scattering with a semiclassical S-
matrix. To handle the problem for this explorative study we have restricted the phase
space to the collinear arrangement of the two electrons reducing the degrees of freedom
to one radial coordinate for each electron. In appreciation of the spherical geometry we
have applied the so called Langer correction to obtain the correct angular momentum
quantization. Thereby, a lower bound to the two-body potential is introduced which
generates a generic situation for bound state dynamics since the (singular) Coulomb
potential is replaced by a potential bounded from below. The ﬁnite depth of the two-
body potential leads to singularities in the semiclassical scattering matrix (rainbow
eﬀect) which call for a uniformization.

Hence, we have carried out and compared among each other classical (where
applicable), semiclassical, and uniformized semiclassical calculations for the singlet,
triplet and spin-averaged ionization and excitation probabilities. Two general trends

may be summarized: Firstly, the simple semiclassical probabilities are overall in
better agreement with the quantum results for the singlet/triplet observables than the
uniformized results. The latter are only superior close to the singularities. Secondly,
for the (experimentally most relevant) spin-averaged probabilities the classical (non-
symmetrizable) result is almost as good as the semiclassical one compared to the
exact quantum probability. This holds for excitation as well as for ionization. Hence,
we conclude from our explorative study that a full semiclassical treatment for spin-
averaged observables is probably not worthwhile since it does not produce better
results than the much simpler classical approach. Clearly, this conclusion has to be
taken with some caution since we have only explored a collinear, low dimensional
phase space.

Abstract.

Negative ion detachment in two-colour laser ﬁeld is considered within the recent
modiﬁcation of Keldysh model which makes it quantitatively reliable. The general
approach is illustrated by calculation of angular diﬀerential detachment rates,
partial rates for particular ATD (Above Threshold Detachment) channels and total
detachment rates for H− ion in bichromatic ﬁeld with 1:2 frequency ratio. Both
perturbative and strong ﬁeld regimes are examined. Polar asymmetry and phase eﬀects
are quantitatively characterized with some new features revealed. Phase eﬀects are
found to result in a huge anisotropy factor ∼ 103 in the electron angular distribution
in the perturbative regime.

1.

Introduction

Photoionization of atoms in bichromatic laser ﬁeld had received recently a considerable
attention both in theory (see, for instance, Baranova et al 1990, 1992, 1993, Baranova
and Zel’dovich 1991, Sz¨oke et al 1991, Anderson et al 1992, Schafer and Kulander 1992,
Potvliege and Smith 1991, 1992a,b, 1994, Pazdzersky and Yurovsky 1994, Protopapas
et al 1994, V´eniard et al 1995, Pazdzersky and Usachenko 1997, Fiﬁrig et al 1997) and
experiment (Muller et al 1990, Ce Chen and Elliott 1990, Baranova et al 1991, 1992,
Yin et al 1992). One of the principal points of interest seems to be dependence of the
observables on the diﬀerence of ﬁeld phases ϕ, i.e. the problem of phase control. Another
important aspect is the angular (polar) asymmetry of photoionization rate. These eﬀects
are interrelated since polar asymmetry is ϕ-dependent and vanishes for some particular
value of phase (see more detail below). The calculations have been carried out previously
for ionization of hydrogen atom in two laser ﬁelds with a frequency ratio 1:2 (Schafer and
Kulander 1992), 1:3 (Potvliege and Smith 1991) and 2:3 (Potvliege and Smith 1994).

Potvliege and Smith (1992) presented results for various frequency ratios and initial
states. Diﬀerent schemes were employed, but all of them implied numerically intensive
work.

For the multiphoton electron detachment from negative ions some analytical
treatment exists (Baranova et al 1993, Pazdzersky and Yurovsky 1994, Pazdzersky
and Usachenko 1997) being limited mostly to the case when one or both ﬁelds are
weak. The presence of large number of parameters in the problem sometimes makes
results of analytical studies not directly transparent. The case of ﬁelds with comparable
(and large) intensities is also of interest bearing in mind both possible experimental
realizations and the theoretical description of the transition between the multiphoton
and tunneling regimes.

The multiphoton electron detachment from negative ions presents unique situation
when quantitatively reliable results can be obtained by analytical methods in a broad
range of parameters characteristic to the problem. Indeed, it has been demonstrated
recently (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b) that judicious modiﬁcation of the Keldysh
(1964) model† ensures a very good quantitative agreement with results of numerically
intensive developments, being much more simple.
In many cases it also provides
It works unexpectedly well even
good agreement with available experimental data.
for small number n of photons absorbed. In addition to numerous examples considered
previously (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b), here we brieﬂy comment on the most recent
experiments by Zhao et al (1997) on non-resonant excess photon detachment of negative
hydrogen ions. After absorption of two photons, the electron is ejected in superposition
of S and D waves due to selection rules. The experiment demonstrates prevalence of D
wave contribution (90% ± 10%). Our calculations give for D and S waves population
86.2% and 13.6% respectively‡ for experimental conditions (light frequency ω = 0.0428,
ﬁeld intensity I = 1010W/cm2. The elaborate numerical calculations by Telnov and
Chu (1996) and by Nikolopoulos and Lambropoulos (1997) give for D wave population
91% and 89% respectively. The diﬀerence between these values is almost the same as
the diﬀerence between our result and that of Nikolopoulos and Lambropoulos (1997),
all three theoretical predictions lying within experimental error bars. This, together
with the cases considered earlier allows us to suggest that even for n = 2 an approach
(Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b) provides an accuracy comparable with that of the most
elaborate numerical developments.

The present paper extends approach of Gribakin and Kuchiev (1997a,b) to the

† Subsequent development of this model was due to Perelomov et al (1966), Faisal (1973) and Reiss
(1980); Perelomov and Popov (1967) were the ﬁrst to consider multicolour process within this framework
in terms of inﬂuence of higher harmonics on ionization probabilities.

eﬀect proves to be less than 0.2% thus sustaining the model applicability.

case of bichromatic ﬁeld. Its objective is to provide the scheme and some representative
quantitative results for two-colour electron detachment from negative ions. In particular,
the phase eﬀects and the polar asymmetry are studied. The number of parameters in
the problem is quite large and at the moment they cannot be ﬁxed experimentally.
Nevertheless it seems to be worthwhile to carry out some pivoting calculations in order
to obtain insight into the possible magnitude of eﬀects speciﬁc for negative ions in
bichromatic ﬁelds. We consider angular diﬀerential detachment rates, heights of ATD
(Above Threshold Detachment) peaks and total detachment rates.

2. Scheme of calculations

The previously developed scheme (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b) needs some
modiﬁcations to incorporate bichromatic problem when electric ﬁeld in the light wave

~F (t) = ~F1 cos ω1t + ~F2 cos(ω2t + ϕ)

is a superposition of two harmonic components with the frequencies ω1, ω2 and the
amplitude vectors ~F1, ~F2 respectively; ϕ is the diﬀerence of ﬁeld phases. Atomic units
are used throughout the paper unless stated otherwise.

We consider a case of commensurable ﬁeld frequencies† which implies that the

common period T exists such that

T =

M1 =

M2

2π

ω2

for some mutually simple integers M1 and M2.

The exact expression for the diﬀerential transition rate dwλ is derived following

Here ψ0(t) = exp(−iE0t)φ0 describes an initial state for the time-independent
Hamiltonian H0, and ψλ(t) is a quasienergy state for the total Hamiltonian H =
H0 + V (t), which includes interaction with the periodic ﬁeld V (t) = −e~r · ~F (t),
V (t) = V (t + T ):

et al (1984), Ho and Chu (1984), Manakov et al (1986), Potvliege and Smith (1992).

Eλ is the quasienergy, ρλ is the density of states, ~r is the active electron vector. The
energy ǫf absorbed by electromagnetic ﬁeld could be presented as ǫf = n1 ω1 + n2 ω2
with some integers n1 and n2. However this representation (i.e. the choice of n1 and n2)
generally is non-unique which reﬂexes existence of diﬀerent coherent interfering paths
(with diﬀerent number of absorbed and emitted photons of each frequency) leading to
the same ﬁnal state.

If interaction of light wave with an electron is described in the dipole-length form, as
presumed above, then a long range contribution to the matrix elements is emphasized.
Therefore it is suﬃcient to employ an asymptotic form of the initial-state wave function
(Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a):

φ0(~r) ≈ Arν−1 exp(−κr) Ylm(ˆ~r)
where E0 = − 1
2 κ2, ν = Z/κ, Z is the charge of the atomic residual core (ν = Z = 0
for a negative ion), and ˆ~r is the unit vector. The coeﬃcients A are tabulated for many
negative ions (Radzig and Smirnov 1985).

The amplitude Aλǫf (4) is evaluated neglecting the inﬂuence of atomic potential
on the photoelectron in the ﬁnal state. Further on, the integral over time in (4) is
calculated within the stationary phase approximation which presumes large magnitude
of the classical action

The frequencies ω1 and ω2 are integer multiples of the basic frequency ω = 2π/T

ω1 = M1 ω,

ω2 = M2 ω.

Assuming for deﬁniteness that M2 > M1 and introducing ζ = exp(iωt) we notice that
the function

is a polynomial of the power 4M2 in ζ. This observation is of practical importance since
equation (13) deﬁning the saddle point is equivalent to

P(ζ) = ζ 2M2S′(ζ)

P(ζ) = 0.

The eﬃcient numerical procedures for ﬁnding roots of polynomials are available, and,
in particular, one can be conﬁdent that all the roots are found.

The practical calculations are conveniently carried out using the Mathematica
program (Wolfram 1991). Starting from the expression for S′(t) one derives S(t) and
S′′(t) by analytical integration and diﬀerentiation respectively. The saddle points are
found using Eq.(18), and the roots tµ lying in the upper half plane are selected. Finite
summation over µ in (11) or (12) completes the calculation.

The roots tµ and hence the photoionization amplitude (11) and rate (12) depend on
the orientation of electron translational momentum ~p with respect to the ﬁeld amplitudes
~F1 and ~F2. It is not diﬃcult to consider the ﬁelds of various relative orientation and
polarization, but for simplicity we limit our further calculations to linear polarized ﬁelds
with ~F1 k ~F2. Then the diﬀerential photoionization rate depends only on the single angle
θ between the vectors ~p and ~F1 k ~F2.

3. Results

Our calculations for H− detachment are carried out for the parameters κ = 0.2354,
A = 0.75 (Radzig and Smirnov 1985). The frequencies ratio ω1/ω2 = 1 : 2 is considered.
In this case the ﬁeld (1) have zero mean value, but possesses polar asymmetry (i.e.
asymmetry under inversion of the z axis directed along ~F1 k ~F2) which could be
conveniently characterized by the time-average value (Baranova et al 1990)

hF 3i =

F 2

1 F2 cos ϕ.

(19)

Presuming that F1, F2 > 0, from this expression one infers, for instance, that for
the phase ϕ ∈ [0, 1
2 π] the electric ﬁeld eﬀectively attains larger values in the positive-
z direction than in the negative-z one. This is illustrated, for example, by Fig.1 in
the paper by Schafer and Kulander (1992), or by Fig.2 in the paper by Baranova et
al (1993). Note that our deﬁnition of the phase ϕ is the same as in the papers by
Baranova et al (1990), Muller et al (1990), Pazdzersky and Yurovsky (1995), but diﬀers
from that chosen by Schafer and Kulander (1992) who describe the electric ﬁled as
~F (t) = ~F1 sin ω1t + ~F2 sin(ω2t + ϕKS). Namely, the phases are related as ϕKS = ϕ − 1
2π.
Although the formula (19) shows that the ﬁeld has polar symmetry for ϕ = 1
2π and
the maximal polar asymmetry for ϕ = 0, quite paradoxically, the diﬀerential detachment
rate (12) possesses polar symmetry for ϕ = 0 (i.e.
is invariant under transformation
θ ⇒ π − θ), and is asymmetrical for other values of phase (see discussion by Baranova
et al (1990), Schafer and Kulander (1992), Pazdzersky and Yurovsky (1995)).

The other features of the phase eﬀects are as follows.

(i) The system Hamiltonian is a 2π-periodic function of the parameter ϕ.

(ii) The system Hamiltonian is not changed by simultaneous transformation ϕ ⇒ −ϕ,

θ ⇒ π − θ. The same applies to the diﬀerential detachment rate (12).

(iii) The transformation ϕ ⇒ π −ϕ leaves the Hamiltonian invariant only if t is replaced

by −t.

As stressed by Baranova et al (1990), Baranova and Zeldovich (1991), Anderson
et al (1992), Baranova et al (1993), the problem is invariant under the time inversion

operation provided the ﬁnal-state electron interaction with the atomic core is neglected.
This is the case in the present model. Therefore our diﬀerential ionization rates are the
same for ϕ and (π − ϕ); hence it is suﬃcient for us to consider phases only from the
interval ϕ ∈ [0, 1
2 π]. The calculations by Baranova et al (1990) within the perturbation
theory and by Schafer and Kulander (1992) within the wave propagation technique
took into account the ﬁnal state electron-core interaction. Therefore they have found
some deviations from the symmetry under ϕ ⇒ (π − ϕ) transformation. However, for
the negative ion photodetachment this eﬀect could be anticipated to have only minor
inﬂuence.

At ﬁrst we consider two ﬁelds with the frequencies ω = 0.0043 and 2ω and equal
intensities I1 = I2 = 109W/cm2. It is well known that the regime of detachment process
is governed by the Keldysh parameter γ = ωκ/F (γ ≫ 1 for multiphoton detachment
in perturbative regime; γ ≪ 1 for strong ﬁeld, or tunneling regime). In the present case
for the ﬁrst ﬁeld we have γ1 = ω1κ/F1 = 6, and for the second ﬁeld γ2 = 2γ1, which
corresponds to multiphoton regime.

Fig.1 (as well as Figs.2-4 below) shows diﬀerential detachment rate as a function of

the angle θ. The abscissas of the plots give the magnitude of

where the right hand side was calculated using the right hand side of the formula (12).
The left hand side of Eq.(20) has the factor 1
2 . It means that the true detachment rate
in case of H− ion is twice larger than that given by Eq.(12). By this we account for
the two possible spin states of residual H atom (i.e. for the presence of two equivalent
electrons in H−).

In Fig.1 we show the diﬀerential detachment rate for the ﬁrst and second ATD peaks
which correspond to absorption of n = 7 and n = 8 photons of frequency ω respectively.
In Fig.2 the same results are shown but for doubled value of the ﬁeld amplitude F2. In
Fig.3 the amplitude F2 is the same as in Fig.1, but the amplitude F1 is doubled.

In all cases the angular distributions exhibit strong dependence on the ﬁeld phase
diﬀerence ϕ. This is well expected since the angular patterns are formed by interference
of contributions coming from diﬀerent complex-valued moments of time tµ. For ϕ = 0
the distribution is rather ﬂat, with ϕ increasing it becomes more oscillatory. An
interesting, and not obvious feature is that for ϕ = 1
2π the rate turns zero at the
values of angle θ where it has minimum.

In Fig.4 we present the results for the same frequencies as before and equal ﬁeld
intensities I1 = I2 = 1011W/cm2. Here the Keldysh parameter for the ﬁrst ﬁeld is
γ1 = ω1κ/F1 = 0.6. Bearing in mind the presence of the second ﬁeld one can suppose
that the situation corresponds to the onset of strong-ﬁeld domain. The ﬁrst open ATD
channel corresponds to absorption of n = 18 photons of frequency ω. The patterns in

8

over angles

diﬀerential rates become more oscillatory than in the weak ﬁled case.

The partial detachment rate for each ATD channel is obtained by integration of (12)

(cid:0)
asymmetry. As discussed above, the polar asymmetry disappears (i.e. w(u)
N ) for
ϕ = 0. In the perturbative regime (Fig.5) for the same conditions as in Fig.1 we see
that the bulk polar asymmetry parameter w(u)
N exceeds 103 even for the lowest ATD
channel (N = 1) provided the phase ϕ is not too small (the open ATD channels are
labeled by the number N = 1, 2, . . . in order of increasing emitted electron energy). For
higher ATD peaks the bulk asymmetry is even larger.

N is
shown in Fig.6 for three representative values of ϕ. Even for N = 1 the variation of the
phase ϕ leads to the substantial change in the detachment rate described by a factor 4.
In the tunneling regime the bulk polar asymmetry (Fig.7) is not as prominent as in
the perturbative regime. Nevertheless it is quite substantial. Note that both in Fig.5
is more probable
and Fig.7 the electron emission in the upper half-space
for all N, i.e. w(u)
). As discussed
(cid:3)
above (see the property (ii)), the situation is reversed for ϕ ∈

(cid:3)
of the phase ϕ = 1
8π in Fig.7 there is a clear tendency to swap the relation between
w(u)
N and w(l)
N for higher values of N which is prevented by a kind of ’pseudocrossing’.
For larger ϕ the partial rates w(l)
N are strongly suppressed when N increases. The phase
eﬀects in the partial rates wN are less signiﬁcant in the tunneling regime (Fig.8).

The results for the total rates as well as w(l, u) =

the perturbative regime we see again strong bulk asymmetry (three orders of magnitude
and more) if the phase diﬀerence ϕ is not close to zero, and substantial variation of w
with ϕ. Actually this result reiterates that for the partial rate with N = 1 since the
latter gives a dominant contribution to the total rate in the perturbative regime.

In the strong ﬁeld regime the bulk polar asymmetry w(l)/w(u) remains well
manifested in the rate summed over all ATD channels. However, the total rate w is
practically insensitive to the phase variation. The partial rates wN in Fig.8 exhibit
some oscillatory structure as functions of N with position of extrema depending on ϕ.

This ϕ-dependence almost completely disappears after summation over N as table 1
shows.

4. Conclusion

As a summary, the approach of Gribakin and Kuchiev (1997a,b) provides convenient
tool for investigating two-colour photodetachment of negative ions. The bichromatic
electron detachment for H− ion in the ﬁelds with 1:2 frequency ratio is examined in the
perturbative and tunneling regimes. The polar asymmetry is found to be tremendously
strong (∼ 103) in the perturbative regime. Note that the asymmetry remains strong and
keeps the same sign for all ATD for a wide range of phases 0 < ϕ < π. This property
makes this eﬀect be convenient for experimental observation because it manifests itself
very strongly even for a relatively poor resolution of the phase δϕ ∼ π/2 . It should
be noted that via the recoil mechanism the predicted eﬀect leads also to acceleration of
the core thus creating anisotropic ﬂux of neutral H atoms.

Figure captions

Figure 1. Detachment of H− ion in bichromatic ﬁeld with the frequencies ω = 0.0043
and 2ω and equal intensities I1 = I2 = 109W/cm2. Diﬀerential detachment rate (see
Eq.(20)) (in units 10−12a.u.) as a function of the angle θ is shown for the ﬁrst (a,
absorption of n = 7 photons of frequency ω) and second (b, n = 8) ATD peaks and
various values of the ﬁeld phase diﬀerence: solid curve - ϕ = 0; short-dashed curve
- ϕ = 1
8 π; long-dashed curve -
ϕ = 1
2 π.

8 π; dot-dashed curve - ϕ = 1

4 π; dotted curve - ϕ = 3

Figure 2. Same as in Fig.1, but for unequal ﬁeld intensities I1 = 109W/cm2,
I1 = 4 × 109W/cm2. The diﬀerential detachment rates is shown in units 10−10a.u.

Figure 3. Same as in Fig.1, but for unequal ﬁeld intensities I1 = 4 × 109W/cm2,
I1 = 109W/cm2. The diﬀerential detachment rate is shown in units 10−10a.u.

Figure 4. Same as in Fig.1, but in the strong ﬁeld regime: I1 = I2 = 1011W/cm2.
The detachment rate for the ﬁrst (a, absorption of n = 18 photons of frequency ω)
and second (b, n = 19) ATD peaks is shown in units 10−6a.u.

Figure 5. Partial detachment rates for various ATD channels for H− ion in
bichromatic ﬁeld with the same parameters as in Fig.1 (perturbative regime) and
various values of the ﬁeld phase diﬀerence ϕ. N labels ATD peaks with the lowest
N = 1 peak corresponding to absorption of 7 photons of frequency ω = 0.0043. The
rate w(u)
N of electron emission in the upper half-space is shown by circles, its counterpart
w(l)
N for the lower half-space is depicted by triangles. The plot for ϕ = 1
8 π additionally
includes the rate for ϕ = 0 (crosses) when emission is polar symmetrical (w(u)
N = w(l)
N ).
The symbols are joined by lines to help the eye.

Figure 6. Same as in Fig.5, but for the detachment rate integrated over all angles
wN = w(u)
N . The results for three values of the phase ϕ are shown: circles –
ϕ = 0; blocks – ϕ = 1

N + w(l)

4 π, triangles – ϕ = 1

2 π.

Figure 7. Same as in Fig.5, but for the ﬁeld parameters chosen as in Fig.4 (strong
ﬁeld regime). The lowest N = 1 peak corresponds to absorption of 18 photons of
frequency ω = 0.0043. The detachment rate is shown in units 10−6 a.u.

Figure 8. Same as in Fig.6, but for the ﬁeld parameters chosen as in Fig.7 (strong
ﬁeld regime). The detachment rate is shown in units 10−6 a.u.

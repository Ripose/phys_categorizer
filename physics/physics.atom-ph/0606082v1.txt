It is established within the Thomas — Fermi model that a special type of bound state of a proton
with a heavy atom should exist. On the one hand, the electrons of the atom screen the proton’s
ﬁeld. This decreases the repulsion force between the proton and the nucleus. On the other hand,
the attraction force between the proton and the electrons is directed towards the gradient of the
electron density, i. e. towards the nucleus. For Z = 80 both forces become equal at approximately
0.6a where a is the Bohr radius. The corresponding minimum of the proton potential energy is in
the region of negative energies that can be of the order of several tens of eV.

In contrast to the ordinary molecules where a coupling with a hydrogen atom is due to an essential
modiﬁcation of one or several states of the outer electrons we consider a special eﬀect that is a
collective response of the whole system of inner electrons to the potencial of a proton that is well
inside the heavy atom.

PACS numbers: 31.15.Ne, 31.15.Gy, 31.15.Md, 31.15.Bs

The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that a proton can be bound to a heavy atom with the charge
1. The principal idea of the paper can be formulated as follows: when a proton approaches the

of the nucleus Z
nucleus its potential is screened by the atomic electrons.

To visualize the physics of this phenomenon we start with the analysis of a subsidiary problem. We will consider a
Thomas — Fermi screening of a proton ﬁeld in a homogeneous electron system having average density N neutralized
by immobile positive charges. We have

Now we will treat the problem we are interested in, namely a proton in the ﬁeld of electrons and a heavy nucleus.
The electron system will be treated within the Thomas — Fermi (TF) model (see, for instance, Ref.2). According to
the model half of the electron charge of the atom is within a sphere of the radius 1.33aZ −1/3 where a is the Bohr
radius. The electron density enhances as the distance from the nucleus becomes smaller. Let the distance between
the nucleus and the proton be of the order of a. Its potential should be screened by the electrons. As a result, the
repulsion between the proton and nucleus becomes much smaller. As the electron density goes up while R goes down

(1)

RN now is not
the electrons should attract the proton. The force of attraction cannot be calculated using Eq. (4) as
small. The calculations below show that for Z = 80 the force of attraction by the electrons and the force of repulsion
by the nucleus are counterbalanced for R
0, 6a. This is an indication for the possibility of a bound state formation.
We will be interested in the bound state with the lowest energy, i. e. the lowest S-state.

We wish to emphasize that there is a principal diﬀerence between the unique state treated in the present paper
and an ordinary molecule of a chemical compound containing a hydrogen atom. In such compounds the coupling of
a hydrogen atom is due to an essenial modiﬁcation of one or a few outer electron states whereas here we consider a
special eﬀect that is a collective change of the whole distribution of the atom’s inner electrons by the proton potential.
Consider the screening of a proton by the electrons of a heavy atom. We assume the distance between the proton
a. We will make estimates of the energy of such a system within the TF model. In the ﬁrst order

Let us transform Eq. (5) into such a form that it gives a local relation between δN and ϕ. δN being given, ϕ is
determined by the Poisson equation. Incerting the relation between δN and ϕ we get a selfconsistent equation for ϕ.

The perturbation for every electron is the proton potential plus the potential produced by δN , i. e. the screened
proton potential. In (5) and (6), there is a contribution of a selfacting electron. It gives a contribution to the screened
potential ϕ. This contribution is however negligibly small as the electron number Z is large. The total energy variation
of the system δE1 is the sum of expressions (6) over all the particles including the nucleus

Let z-axis join the nucleus and the proton. Then ϕ(r) does not depend on the azimuthal angle and can be expanded

as

where Ps is a Legendre polynomial. As N (r) has spherical symmetry, only ϕ0(r) contributes to Eq. (7). Now we will

The jump in the derivative is due to the presence of the proton at the distance R from the nucleus. For small
values of r we solve these equations numerically. For r > R one can use the eikonal approximation that is valid at
2p2q. Using the TF variable x = γR, γ = Z 1/3/0.885 one can see that these solutions are independent of Z.

Making use of the well known TF relation between N (r) and Φ(r) and the values of Φ given in the tables one
can calculate ∆E1 Eq.(7) for diﬀerent R. Mark that an additional correction is needed (however, small compared to
∆E1). We have considered the screening in a neutral atom. The total electron charge surplus near the proton due to
the screening is
faster than
1. Indeed, the total potential of the proton and δN Eq. (18) tends to zero at r
r−1. The corresponding correction ∆E2 should not exceed the energy of one-electron ionization of the atom. In the
TF model this energy appears to be lower than the experimental values. Such a discrepancy is due to the fact that
in this model such properties are essentially related with the distances r
1 where the TF approximation fails. The
average (over a number of atoms) experimental value of the ionization energy is about 0.3 atomic units. The variation
of the energy ∆E = ∆E1 + ∆E2 is presented in Fig. 1. Here we have assumed ∆E2 = 0.3 a. u.

Let us analyze the approximations used to obtain ∆E. First, this is the one-electron approximation. The character-

integral (7) is determined by the interval r <

We have calculated the energy ∆E for Z=80 and R < 1. For R > 1 our theory ceases to be applicable. (When
calculating the integral (7) the interval of integration has been taken from 0 to 1 where the integrand is well deﬁned).
N (r) decreases with r; ϕ0(r) increases for r < R and decreases for r > R. The integrand varies slowly for r < R and
rapidly decays for r > R. Thus for R < 0.8 the discarded additional energy is small.

The experimental search of the predicted phenomenon should probably be performed with plasmas or using a source
of low-energy protons. The energy release in the course of proton trapping might be accompanied by Auger-processes
and X-ray emission. The probability of a proton capture might be bigger for a heavy atom in a condensed matter (i.
e. as a target) than in vapor. The described method is applicable for estimates of the binding energy of two protons
with a heavy atom. If the average distance between the protons is of the order of 0.3 ˚A the Coulomb energy of their
repulsion is smaller that the coupling energy obtained in the present paper. Our estimates indicate that a possibility
exists for trapping of α-particles and µ+-mesons.

The TF model describes the average atomic characteristics. It cannot describe their individual properties, such as

their periodicity. This point concerns also our estimates.

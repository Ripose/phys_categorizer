Abstract—We report progress on 115In+ and 137Ba+ single
ion optical frequency standards using all solid-state sources.
Both are free from quadrupole ﬁeld shifts and together en-
able a search for drift in fundamental constants.

I. Introduction

IN single ion optical frequency standards the narrow

transitions of weakly allowed lines serve as high quality
references largely free from shifts and perturbations such as
the ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect. Other research groups have
demonstrated precise control or near-elimination of most
eﬀects, such as the second-order Doppler shift, quadratic
Stark shifts, Zeeman shifts, and ac Stark shifts from black-
body radiation for a diverse set of ion species (In+ [1], Hg+
[2], Yb+ [3], [4], Sr+ [5], Ca+ [6], and proposed in Tl+ [7]).
However, one important eﬀect that remains to be suitably
controlled at the Hz level is the quadrupole Stark shift—
that is, the shift arising from coupling of the trapped ion’s
atomic quadrupole moment to stray dc electric ﬁeld gradi-
ents unavoidably present in the trap region.

Here we propose two single ion optical frequency stan-
dards that are inherently free from this eﬀect and are under
active development. Solid-state lasers for all the required
transitions are commercially available. In addition to being
viable candidates for absolute frequency standards, their
construction can also yield a search for drift in fundamen-
tal physical constants.

II. Indium ion frequency standard

We trap single indium ions in a twisted wire Paul-
Straubel trap with several hundred volts of 10 MHz rf.
We then cool the ions to the Lamb-Dicke regime using
230.6 nm light resonant with the 1S0 ↔ 3P1(F = 11/2)
transition. This radiation is generated by frequency qua-
drupling a 922 nm external cavity diode laser/tapered
ampliﬁer system in resonant build-up cavities containing
KNbO3 and BBO nonlinear crystals. The 3P0 excited state
is long-lived (τ = 195(8) ms [1]) giving the 1S0 ↔ 3P0 tran-
sition a natural linewidth of ∼ 1 Hz and a quality factor of
Q = 1.5(10)15. We create 236.5 nm clock light by frequency
quadrupling the output of a monolithic Nd:YAG laser op-
erating at 946 nm. This laser, manufactured by InnoLight
GmbH, is a non-planar ring oscillator with a nominal free-
running linewidth of 2 kHz. Similar laser systems have
been narrowed below 1 Hz [8] by Pound-Drever-Hall lock-
ing to an isolated high ﬁnesse reference cavity.

Excitation of the clock transition is detected via the ab-
sence of cooling ﬂuorescence when the ion is ‘shelved’ in

and corrects for long-term drifts in the clock laser while it
is stabilized over short times using a stable reference cavity
or other absolute reference, such as a microwave standard
and femtosecond frequency comb.

An important feature of 115In+ is its immunity to
quadrupole Stark shifts due to both ground and excited
clock states having zero electronic angular momentum
J = J ′ = 0. From Ref. [9], quadrupole Stark shifts take
the form

HQ = ∇E(2) · Θ(2)

where the tensor ∇E(2) describes the electric ﬁeld gradi-
ent at the site of the ion and Θ(2) are the set of irreducible
coordinate second-rank tensors.

III. Barium ion frequency standard

Our barium ion trap [10] operates at a similar frequency
and strength as the indium trap but is constructed en-
tirely from non-magnetic tungsten and tantalum. Pas-
sive shielding has achieved ≤ 10 µG magnetic ﬁeld sta-
bility measured using the ion [11]. We cool on the 493 nm
6S1/2 ↔ 6P3/2 transition using a frequency doubled 986 nm
diode laser/tapered ampliﬁer system while also applying
a 650 nm diode laser which empties the long-lived 5D3/2
state. Currently, a static magnetic ﬁeld (B ∼ 1.6 G)
aligned along both lasers eliminates dark states [12] but
for clock applications a low magnetic ﬁeld is desirable; po-
larization modulation will accomplish dark state quenching
[13]. High intensity ﬁltered light-emitting diodes perform
shelving to and deshelving from the 5D5/2 state and could
ultimately be replaced by a 1.76 µm diode laser acting
on the 6S1/2 ↔ 5D5/2 electric-quadrupole transition pre-
viously investigated as a clock candidate [14].

The Ba+ 5D3/2 state lifetime (τ ∼ 80 s [15], [16]) is
among the longest of successfully cooled ions, giving the
6S1/2 ↔ 5D3/2 clock transition at 2051 nm a quality fac-
tor Q = ν/∆ν > 1016. A diode pumped Tm,Ho:YLF
solid state laser manufactured by CLR Photonics produces
> 80 mW at 2051 nm with a free-running linewidth we
have determined to be ∼ 10 kHz. We have detected the
transition in 138Ba+.

137Ba+ shares the advantage with In+ of having van-
ishing shifts due to quadrupole Stark shifts. The atomic
quadrupole moment in Eq. 2 vanishes for the ground state
6S1/2(F = 2) and the 6j-symbol in Eq. 2 vanishes for the
excited clock state 5D3/2(F = 0). Small shifts likely re-
main due to conﬁguration mixing and coupling to the nu-
clear moment but these perturbations are expected to be
much less than 1 mHz.

IV. A search for drift in fundamental constants

Besides applications in navigation, long baseline interfer-
ometry, and detection of drift in pulsar periodicity, optical
atomic frequency standards enable laboratory searches for
drift in fundamental constants [19]. Cosmological observa-
tions [20] as well the analysis of the Oklo natural nuclear
reactor [21] suggest drift in the ﬁne-structure constant.
Since relativistic corrections to clock transition frequen-
cies of diﬀerent atomic species depend on diﬀerent pow-

ers of the constant α, a linear drift of α over time will
be detected as an accumulated error between two or more
atomic optical frequency standards. Table I shows the es-
timated clock frequency change that would occur in one
˙α/α = 10−15 yr−1
year assuming a fractional change of
using latest theoretical results [17], [18].

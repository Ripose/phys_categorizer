Abstract. Recent progress in the study of the photon emission from highly-charged
heavy ions is reviewed. These investigations show that high-Z ions provide a unique
tool for improving the understanding of the electron-electron and electron-photon
interaction in the presence of strong ﬁelds. Apart from the bound-state transitions,
which are accurately described in the framework of Quantum Electrodynamics, much
information has been obtained also from the radiative capture of (quasi-) free electrons
by high-Z ions. Many features in the observed spectra hereby conﬁrm the inherently
relativistic behavior of even the simplest compound quantum systems in Nature.

Photon emission from highly charged heavy ions

1. Introduction

Hundred years after Einstein put forth his ideas about relativity and the particle
nature of light, the photon emission from highly-charged, heavy ions has been found
a unique and very exciting framework for studying his visionary concepts in detail. The
gradual discovery that only the combination of relativity with the photon picture in
the framework of quantum mechanics (the theory that was needed to understand the
microscopic world) could describe the interaction between light and matter in all its
diversity is well exempliﬁed by recent case studies on high-Z ions. This combination
has lead also to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the most accurate and successful
theory in physics today, and served as model for those Field Theories that now compose
the Standard Model. Relativistic transformations are also required to interpret the
experiments with high-energetic ions, if their speed becomes a sizeable fraction of the
speed of light. Indeed, experiments using Laser spectroscopy at ions storage rings have
enabled to test with high accuracy time dilation (Saathoﬀ et al. 2003). Born less than
3 decades ago, the ﬁeld of highly charged ions is therefore a tribute to Einstein’s work.
Today, there are two research lines for which the observed photon spectra are
crucial for our present understanding of the light-matter interaction in the presence
of strong ﬁelds. They are related to the electronic structure and dynamics of high-Z
ions and to great improvements in the accuracy of the experiments. Our (theoretical)
understanding of atoms and ions has advanced considerably during the last decade
thanks, for example, to the study of x-ray transitions between bound states of high-Z
ions. These investigations have established heavy few-electron ions as a privileged tool
owing to the strong enhancement of QED and other relativistic eﬀects by large powers
in (Zα).

In relativistic ion-atom collisions, in addition, much details about the electron-
photon interaction in strong ﬁelds were obtained from the radiative capture of free
(or quasi-free) electrons (REC). At storage rings, this electron capture determines not
only the lifetimes but also provides information about the magnetic components of the
radiation ﬁeld and the coupling of the spin and orbital motion of the electrons. Recent
experimental and theoretical advances showed, furthermore, that REC may provide a
tool for controlling the polarization of ions beams.

In this contribution, the recent progress in the study of the photon emission from
highly-charged heavy ions is reviewed. After a short summary on the experimental
facilities for heavy-ion research in Sec. 2, the photon emission from bound-bound
transitions is discussed in Sec. 3, including the Quantum Electrodynamic corrections
to the transition energies as well as the one- and two-photon emission from high-Z
ions. In Sec. 4, we review the radiative capture of free electrons with some emphasis on
the polarization of the emitted radiation and the alignment of the residual ions, if the
capture occurs into an excited state of the ion. Conclusions and outlook onto future
experiments are ﬁnally given in Sec. 5.

2. Experimental heavy ion facilities

The current progress in the basic ﬁelds of atomic collision- and structure-research
involving highly charged heavy ions is closely related to the application of modern ion
source and accelerator techniques as well as to the use of advanced detection techniques
for photons, electrons and recoil ions. During the last few years the development
of storage rings equipped with electron-cooler devices (Franzke 1987, Franzke 1990,
Bosch 1993, Mokler & St¨ohlker 1996, Steck et al. 2004) and electron beam driven ion
traps have received a lot of attention (Schneider et al. 1989, Marrs, Beiersdorfer &
Schneider 1994, Marrs, Elliott & Knapp 1994, Gillaspy 2001). For the heaviest ions such
as hydrogenlike uranium, a quantum leap was achieved with the advent of the heavy-ion
storage ring ESR at GSI in Darmstadt (see Fig. 1) and the Super-EBIT at Livermore.
At the ESR, electron cooling guarantees for ion beams of unprecedented quality,
i.e. this technique provides cooled and intense beams at high-Z and with precisely
known energies and charge states at small momentum spread (Bosch 1993, Mokler &
St¨ohlker 1996, Steck et al. 2004). These conditions are in particular well suited for the
spectroscopy of x-ray transitions in the heaviest H-like ions. In contrast to storage rings,
at EBIT devices, the highly charged ions are produced at rest in the laboratory. There,
the experiments focus on QED and atomic structure studies for heavy few-electron ions
(Beiersdorfer et al. 1993, Beiersdorfer et al. 1995, Gillaspy 2001).

In the following, we concentrate on the experimental techniques at the heavy-ion
storage ring ESR where radiative recombination and REC transitions have become a
subject of detailed experimental investigations. At the ESR, interaction of the ion
beams with matter can be studied under single collision conditions at the internal
gasjet target where particle densities of about 1012p/cm3 are provided. This can be
compared with a typical density of a solid state target of about 1021p/cm3. Most
important and in contrast to conventional single-pass experiments where direct beams
from relativistic accelerators are used, no active or passive beam collimation is required
at the ESR. Thus, experimental conditions are almost completely background-free. A
further unique feature of the ESR is the deceleration capability of the storage ring. It
nenables to perform atomic collision experiments for highly-charged ions in a completely
for highest atomic charges (e.g. U92+) at
new energy and charge-state domain, i.e.
energies far below their production energy (St¨ohlker et al. 1998, Steck et al. 2004). In
this low-energy domain, the perturbation Q/v (Q and v the charge and the velocity
, respectively) caused by the projectile reaches values otherwise not accessible at
accelerators. Furthermore, the deceleration technique turned out to be indispensable
for accurate precision spectroscopy aiming for a test of QED at high-Z H-like ions such
as H-like uranium. For low-energetic ion beams the relativistic Doppler corrections are
strongly reduced whereas at high energies the Doppler eﬀect is a serious limitation for
such studies. As an example, by applying this technique for U92+ a beam energy of
3 MeV/u could already be achieved (corresponding to a velocity of 8% of the speed of
light c) (Steck et al. 2004) which has to be compared with the production energy for

During the last decade, the progress in storage ring and cooling techniques was
accompanied by an impressive development of position and energy sensitive solid state
detectors for advanced photon spectroscopy. The tremendous progress in this ﬁeld of
detector design, which took place very recently, is mainly motivated by the demands
for eﬃcient γ- and x-ray spectrometers, in connection with the need for such devices
that arises in applied research such as medical
imaging. The properties of such
detectors are millimeter to sub-millimeter spatial resolution as well as time and energy
resolution in the hard x-ray energy regime above 15 keV (Protic et al. 2001, St¨ohlker
et al. 2003). Combined with a focusing crystal spectrometer, for example, these detectors
make possible the measurement of an energy spectrum wide enough to investigate

the whole energy range of interest simultaneously (Beyer et al. 2004). Very recently,
moreover, a microstrip detector system was developed at the Forschungszentrum J¨ulich
(Protic et al. 2001) with a position resolution of close to 200 µm which has become
available for the high-precision x-ray spectroscopy at the ESR storage ring (St¨ohlker
et al. 2003, Beyer et al. 2004). Along with a new kind of transmission crystal
spectrometer (Beyer et al. 2004), such detectors may play a key role for a precise
test of quantum electrodynamics in the heaviest one-electron systems. Another very
important feature of granular, position sensitive systems is their sensitivity to the photon
polarization at energies above 100 keV. Using two-dimensional solid-state detectors, it
was shown recently that the polarization of bound-bound and free-bound transitions
in highly-charged heavy ions can be measured with high accuracy by exploiting the
Compton scattering within the detector (St¨ohlker et al. 2004). This is illustrated in
Fig. 2, where the detection geometry for a polarization experiment is displayed, using a
germanium pixel detector (see also Sec. 4.2).

3. Relativistic and Quantum Electrodynamics eﬀects in photon emission

The photon emission from highly charged ions has many speciﬁc aspects which all related
to the fact that the speed of the electron on its orbit is of order Zαc, which is worth
66 % of the speed of light for the 1s shell of uranium. The relativistic eﬀects enter

the transition rates by both the transition energy and the operator. In this section we
summarize a number of theoretical considerations for both energies and transition rates
and discuss a number of experimental results.

3.1. Quantum Electrodynamics corrections to transition energies

Relativistic Quantum theory really started when Dirac (1928) proposed the equation
bearing his name. Because he started from the relation between mass, impulsion and
energy, E2 = m2c4 + p2c2, introduced by Einstein’s relativity, Dirac found that his
equation had both positive and negative energy solutions. He was thus lead to the
concept of the Dirac electron sea to avoid transitions from positive energy states to
negative energy ones. Soon, moreover, the relativistic form of the electron-electron
interaction was investigated by Breit (1929). The existence of the Dirac sea lead to
the idea of Vacuum Polarization, that had calculable eﬀect on atomic level energies
(Uehling 1935). Yet the theory was plagued by inﬁnities showing up in all sorts of
perturbation expansions. The experiment of Lamb & Retherford (1950) showing that
the Dirac equation could not predict correctly the ﬁne structure of hydrogen was one of
the experiments that lead to QED. After the ﬁrst evaluation of the self-energy by Bethe
(1947), the Lamb shift was calculated more and more accurately in the framework
of non-relativistic QED (NRQED) for many years, as a series in Zα.
It is only in
the 70’s that Mohr (1974) showed, by performing the ﬁrst high-precision, all-order
calculation of the 1s Lamb-shift, that the NRQED Zα expansion did not converge, even
for moderately large Z
10. Since then a considerable amount of non-perturbative
QED calculations have been performed for heavy one- and few-electron ions, including
a complete calculations of QED corrections of order α2, e.g., two loop self-energy, see
Yerokhin et al. (2003b) and references therein. For a review of non-perturbative, one-
electron QED calculations, see, e.g., Mohr et al. (1998). A few years later, a series
of experiments measuring the hydrogen-like ions 1s Lamb shift started, the ﬁrst one
being peformed at the BEVALAC in Berkeley (Briand et al. 1990). Within the past 14
years, thanks to the use of heavy-ion storage rings, the experimental accuracy for the
1s Lamb-shift has improved by a factor of 25, although it cannot yet match theoretical
accuracy (Fig. 3). The most recent values for the diﬀerent QED and nuclear corrections
to the 1s Lamb shift in hydrogen-like uranium are presented in Table 1 and compared
with recent experimental results obtained at ESR.

≥

Following the ﬁrst experiment on Lithium-like uranium (Schweppe et al. 1991), a
large eﬀort has also been made in the evaluation of QED corrections for three-electron
systems (Indelicato & Mohr 1991, Cheng et al. 1991, Cheng et al. 1993, Yerokhin
et al. 1998, Yerokhin et al. 1999, Yerokhin et al. 2000, Indelicato & Mohr 2001).
Simultaneously the use of electron storage rings provided many accurate measurements
(Brandau et al. 2003).
In principle, QED is the theory of choice to perform such
calculations for heavy ions. Yet, as soon as a high accuracy is required, QED cannot be
used alone in practice, even for relatively large Z. This is because the real behavior of

the corrections corresponding to n exchanged photons between two interacting electrons
is only 1/Z n while a naive look at the corresponding Feynmann diagrams would lead
to expect a dependence in αn. One would then have to evaluate Feynman diagrams
of very high order to reach an acceptable precision, which is impossible with presently
known QED techniques, although some explorations are being done (Lindgren 2000). In
practice, therefore, one has to resort to relativistic many-body methods like Relativistic
Many Body Peturbation Theory (RMBPT), Relativistic Conﬁguration Interaction
(RCI) and Multi-Conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF), which are described in Sec. 3.2,
and to correct for missing QED contributions order by order if doable.

3.2. Relativistic Many-Body issues

The need for relativistic self-consistent ﬁeld technique was felt soon after the introduc-
tion of the Dirac equation (Swirles 1935). At ﬁrst the relativistic many-body techniques
were developed from their non-relativistic counterparts, replacing the Schr¨odinger
operator by the Dirac one, and replacing the Coulomb interaction between the electrons
by the Breit interaction.

Over the years relativistic calculations evolved until the development of the MCDF
method by Grant (1970) and Desclaux (1975). Because this method is very general
and (easily) provides a large fraction of the many-body contributions, the so-called
correlation energy, it became rapidly popular. Yet its ties to QED and the role of the
negative energy states, inherent to the use of the Dirac equation, was not considered
for some years. The existence of negative energy states lead to a problem known as

continuum dissolution (Brown & Ravenhall 1951, Sucher 1980): treatment to all orders
using an electron-electron interaction operator that couple positive and negative energy
states (which is the case of even the Coulomb interaction) lead to inﬁnities. No rigorous
solution to this problem can be found outside of QED. Indeed, derivation of the many-
electron Hamiltonian from QED shows that the electron-electron interaction must be
“sandwitched” between projection operators on the positive energy states. It is only
recently that the push toward high-Z few-electron ion experiments prompted a study
on how continuum dissolution happens in MCDF calculation and how to implement
projection operators (Indelicato 1995).

Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation Theory evolved originally from the non-
relativistic work by Kelly (1963) and Lindgren (1974). Early calculations were performed
on lithium-like ions (Johnson et al. 1988). A review on RMBPT techniques and results
can be found in (Sapirstein 1998). Hereby, the implementation of projection operators
in RMBPT was very natural and mandatory as inﬁnities appear already in second
order perturbation theory if such operators are not present (Heully et al. 1986, Heully
et al. 1986b).

An other method that has been used in few-electron calculations is the Relativistic
Conﬁguration Method (RCI). This method is a variant of the MCDF method, which uses
ﬁnite basis sets like RMBPT. It was found to be very eﬀective to describe few-electron
ions (Chen et al. 1993, Cheng et al. 1994, Johnson et al. 1995, Chen et al. 2001).
MCDF and RCI calculations have been tested in experiments realized at the Super-
EBIT in Livermore, on transition to the n = 2 levels of 3 to 10-electron U and Th
ions(Beiersdorfer et al. 1993, Beiersdorfer et al. 1995).

Beside the need for projection operators, there is a number of features that

are common to all relativistic many-body calculations. First, the electron-electron
interaction contains retardation terms, which is a direct consequence of Einstein’s
relativistic theory (ﬁnite speed of light). Because each particle in the system must
have its own proper time in relativity, there can be no exact Hamiltonian formalism
to describe it. This can be seen, for instance, in the expression of the electron-electron
interaction operator, which depends on the one-electron orbital energies. These energies
are knwon only when the full solution of the self-consistent ﬁeld has been found and
cannot be deﬁned a priori in the many-body formalism.

Because of the multitime nature of the problem, the most general formalism to
handle the relativistic many-body problem is the two-time Green’s function formalism
of Shabaev (1990). This formalism is needed, in particular, to add QED corrections to
the transition rates and other quantities beyond the energies. An alternative formalism
has been developed recently (Lindgren et al. 2004), based on covariant evolution
operator. At some point, however, QED corrections to second order in the electron-
electron interaction must be made (Blundell et al. 1993, Lindgren et al. 1995, Mohr
& Sapirstein 2000, ˚As´en et al. 2002). These corrections partially cancel two-electron
self-energy corrections. At present, this interplay between QED and many-body
eﬀects constitutes the greatest challenge posed to the accurate theoretical evaluation
of transition energies in the ﬁeld of highly-charged heavy ions.

3.3. One-photon bound-bound radiative transition

In the helium
Relativistic eﬀects play a central role also in the photon emission.
1s2 1S0 line is called the “relativistic
isoelectronic sequence, for example, the 1s2s 3S1 →
M1” transition because it is completely forbidden in non-relativistic theory. For high-

as intense as the “allowed” transitions, i.e. the diagram line 1s2p 1P1 →
dependence of the transition rates as a function of the atomic number and the successive
multipoles, obtained by the expansion of the relativistic transition operator in spherical
components, is such that high-multipole transitions can occur with sizeable probabilities.
Compared to its non-relativistic equivalents, this operator automatically includes such
relativistic eﬀects as retardation. To stay with the example of the helium-like ions, the
1s2 1S0 M2 transition has a relative strength of 1.5
10−10 at Z = 2, but
1s2p 3P2 →
10−3 at Z = 83. Some example of the evolution of transition probabilities
already 2.5
×
in helium-like ions are shown on Fig. 4 and more details can be found in Marrus &
Mohr (1978). The lifetime of the 1s2s 3S1 in He-like Xe has been measured at GANIL
to 3 % accuracy (Marrus et al. 1989a) and has been found in good agreement with
theory (Johnson et al. 1995a, Indelicato 1996).

×

In general, the higher-order multipole contributions to a given transition rate can
be neglected. However, there are a few cases for which this is not true. For example,
2p1/2 transition in hydrogen-like ions, the M3 contribution represents
in the 3d5/2 →
between 32 % (Z = 1) and 40 % (Z = 92) of the dominant E2 multipole. Similarly, the
2p1/2 M3 transition for
E4 multipole contributes between 51 % to 58 % of the 4f7/2 →
these ions. The study of highly-charged heavy ions has enabled one to observe directly
forbidden transitions beyond M2 transitions, which has been observed or relatively low-
Z for helium-like ions. For example, magnetic octupole (M3) transitions have been
observed in an EBIT for nickel-like Th and U ions (Beiersdorfer et al. 1991). Even if the
contribution of the higher multipoles to the total rate is of the order of 1 %, they can
however inﬂuence the angular distribution of the emitted photons. Recent experiments
on that subject are described in Sec. 4.3.

1s2 1S0 M1 transition (Indelicato 1996).

Transition probabilities in few-electron ions are a very stringent test of relativistic
many-body theories.
In variational methods like the MCDF method, transition
probabilities involve the wavefunction, which is less precisely evaluated than the energy.
In the same way as in the evaluation of transition energies, there are several issues
that have to be addressed when calculating transitions probabilities. For example, one
must also properly account for the negative-energy continuum. This was ﬁrst noticed
for the 1s2s 3S1 →
It was also shown, that
in contrast to the non-relativistic case, the full gauge invariance (for example between
length and velocity gauge for En transitions) can be achieved only if the negative energy
continuum is properly accounted for (Derevianko et al. 1998). An extra complication,
when using highly correlated wavefunctions for evaluating transition probabilities and
other operators, is that the orbitals in initial and ﬁnal wave functions are usually not
orthogonal (Cheng & Johnson 1977). This may have a large eﬀect in some transitions
like the relativistic M1 (Indelicato 1996). Other kinds of transitions like two-electron,
one-photon transitions, may depend entirely on non-orthogonality between correlated
wave functions. A competition between such a transition and an E2 transition has been
predicted and observed in Be-like xenon (Indelicato 1997).

11

There has been little studies of QED corrections to transition amplitudes. Most of
the time, QED corrections are accounted for only by the inclusion of radiative corrections
to the energy (which is done automatically when experimental energy are used for the
calculation of the transition rates). QED corrections to the 2p
1s in
hydrogenlike ions have been calculated recently (Sapirstein et al. 2004). These authors
have shown that there might be a very strong cancellation between the eﬀect of the
energy correction and those of the wavefunction correction. When several electrons are
present, there are other kind of QED corrections that needs to be included. For example,
the reducible contribution to some transitions in helium-like ions has been investigated
(Indelicato et al. 2004) and found to be small.

Forbidden transitions can also be a tool for studying the interaction of the electrons
with the nuclear magnetic moments through the hyperﬁne quenching of the 1s2p 3P0 level
in heliumlike ions which was calculated by the MCDF method (Indelicato et al. 1989)
and later by RMBPT (Johnson et al. 1997). This eﬀect was then observed in a
variety of ions from nickel to gold (Marrus et al. 1989, Dunford et al. 1991, Indelicato
et al. 1992, Birkett et al. 1993, Toleikis et al. 2004). Even the nuclear quadrupole
moment can have a large eﬀect for the lifetimes of metastable states (see, e.g. (Parente
et al. 1994)). The most recent experiment (Toleikis et al. 2004), is the heir of the thirty-
years old Beam-Foil technique. Yet its accuracy is the result of several factors. It uses
the increase in the lifetime of the ion due to relativity at high-beam energies. The set-up
comprises a magnetic spectrometer and an advanced position-sensitive beam detector to
detect the photons from the metastable state in coincidence with ions of the associated
charge-state. Finally it beneﬁts from the high quality of electron-cooled ions beam from
the SIS synchrotron in GSI.

3.4. Two-photon emission

→

Two-photon transitions can become important in heavy ions when a level cannot decay
J = 0 transitions would be
by other ways, e.g., when only strictly forbidden J = 0
possible otherwise. The 2E1 two-photon transition, for instance, dominate the lifetimes
of the 2s and 1s2s 3S1 levels at low-Z, but not at high-Z, because of the strong Z-
In the absence of nuclear magnetic moments, the
dependence of the M1 transition.
1s2s 1S0 level decays mostly by a two-photon transition to the 1s2 1S0 ground-state
level. For such two-photon transitions, however, probabilities are diﬃcult to calculate
and to measure since the two-photon spectrum is spread between zero and the energy
diﬀerence between the initial and ﬁnal levels. Early experiments looked at the single-
photon spectrum, which requires a very good signal to noise ratio, and a large eﬀort to
reduce contaminant X-rays from the environing material. The heaviest highly charged
ions studied by this method was helium-like Kr (Marrus et al. 1986). More recently a
coincidence technique was applied where the two emitted photon are detected by two
diﬀerent detectors. Requiring that the sum of the two-photon energy is equal to the
transition energy, the spectral shape of the continuum distribution of the 2E1 decay was

the theoretical point of view, the transition probability of two-photon transitions is

in hydrogenlike ions have been recalculated recently, taking into account QED correction
to the energy and the nine ﬁrst multipole contributions (Santos et al. 1998). As in
the one-photon case, the E1M2 correction to the dominant 2E1 ranges from a relative
10−11 at Z = 1 to 0.2 % at Z=92. The two-photon decay rates of

of the 1s2s 3S1 state. To the best of our knowledge, no other ion-atom collisions is
known which produces inner-shell excited states with such a high state selectivity. This
unexpected result is currently the subject of detailed theoretical investigations.

4. Electron capture into highly-charged ions

Apart from the bound-state energies and transitions, strong relativistic eﬀects become
visible also in collisions of high-Z, few-electron ions with electrons and low-Z target
atoms. In these collisions, the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the fast-moving projectiles often
causes an ionization or capture of electrons. In particular, the radiative electron capture
(REC) into bare and hydrogen-like high-Z ions has been found to provide a unique tool
for studying the electron-photon interaction in the presence of strong ﬁelds.

4.1. Radiative electron capture

REC into highly-charged ions has been investigated since a long time as it represents
the dominant charge exchange process for bare and H-like ions in collisions with
low-Z targets at high energies (Schnopper et al. 1972, Spindler et al. 1979, Anholt
et al. 1984, St¨ohlker et al. 1992, St¨ohlker et al. 1995, Vane et al. 2000). In this radiative
recombination (RR) process, a free or quasi-free electron is captured into a bound

recombination of (heavy) ions with free electrons is known also as the time-reversed
photo-eﬀect. Besides the total REC cross sections, which determine the lifetimes of
the ion beams at accelerators and storage rings, a number of angular distribution
(Anholt et al. 1984, St¨ohlker et al. 2001) and, more recently, polarization measurements
have been carried out (St¨ohlker et al. 2004, Tachenov et al. 2004) and have shown,

that the radiative capture of electrons is a powerful tool for precise studies on atomic
photoionization with high-energy photons in the strong-ﬁeld domain. Since the very ﬁrst
observations of REC (RR) photons (Schnopper et al. 1972), therefore, this process has
been studied intensively for various bare and few-electron ions, including bare uranium
and projectile energies from a few MeV/u up to the extrem relativistic regime above
100 GeV/u (Vane et al. 2000).

As an example, Figure 7 displays the x-ray spectrum of H-like uranium which was
produced by electron capture in U 92+ collision with N2 at 68 MeV/u (recorded at an
observation angle of 132◦). As in the case of photoionization, the energy of the REC
photons, ~ω REC = Eb + E kin, is given by the sum of the binding energy Eb and the
kinetic energy E kin of the free electron in the projectile frame (in the present experiment
the kinetic electron energy E kin amounts to
37 keV). For the REC transitions into
the 1s ground state of hydrogen-like uranium (E1s ≈
132 keV), the K-REC peak is thus
found in the high-energy part of the spectrum, at a photon energy of around 170 keV.
Hereby, the broadening of these K-REC lines (compared to the characteristic transitions)
is due to the momentum distribution of the target electrons (Compton proﬁle).

≈

Because of the relatively low velocity of the decelerated ions, the two j = 1/2 and
j = 3/2 ﬁne-structure components of the L-REC x-ray lines around 50 keV are still
4.5 keV. This illustrates one of the beneﬁts of using
resolved and are separated by
deceleration techniques in REC experiments, while the large line broadening at high
projectile energies, caused by the Compton proﬁle, often prevents the separation of the
ﬁne structure components (St¨ohlker et al. 1998). The L-shell ﬁne structure splitting, in
addition, also leads to an energy separation of the two Lyman-α ground-state transitions

On the left side of Fig. 8, the K-REC angular distribution for the capture into
88 MeV/u U 92+ ions is shown as function of the photon emission angle in the laboratory
frame (solid circles) and are compared with rigorous relativistic calculations (St¨ohlker
et al. 2001). As for the structure calculations in Sec. 3, a relativistic treatment of the
electrons and the electron-photon interaction is typically required in order to under-
stand the observed data from the collision experiments (Ichihara et al. 1994, Eichler &
Meyerhof 1995, Ichihara et al. 1996). As seen from the ﬁgure, moreover, the measured
angular distribution conﬁrms well the slight asymmetry with respect to a perpendicular
photon emission as predicted by theory. Most remarkable, however, is the non-vanishing
cross section close to 0◦, which demonstrates that the magnetic contributions are still
present in the low-energy domain. Since the magnetic multipoles contribute 3 % to the
total K-REC cross-section (cf. the dashed area in Fig. 8), this enhancement of the photon
emission in forward direction shows the sensitivity of the applied method. Note that
the (almost) symmetrical angular distribution with respect to 90◦ is a particular feature
of the laboratory frame which arises from the cancellation of the various eﬀects due to
the retardation of the electron-photon interaction and the Lorentz transformation for
going from the projectile to the laboratory framework, a behaviour which was predicted
already by the non-relativistic theory (Spindler et al. 1979, Anholt et al. 1984).

In the emitter frame, in contrast, a strong variation occurs for the angular distri-
bution of the emitted photons as function of the projectile energies. This is illustrated
in Fig. 8(right side) where the observed data are Lorentz-transformed into the projectile
frame. Even for the low energy regime where the kinetic electron energy E kin is much
smaller than the binding energy in the ﬁnal state Eb, that is for a photoionization
close to the threshold (St¨ohlker et al. 2001), the angular distribution still exhibits a
considerable backward peaking in accordance with the enhanced forward emission in
the direct photoionization process. This behaviour of the angular distribution can be
understood easily by replacing θ′ by π
θ′ as indicated on the upper abscissa of Figure 8.
Theoretically, the radiative electron capture and all the subsequent emission processes
are most easily described by means of the density matrix theory where, instead of
a single collision event, an ensemble of (equally prepared) systems is considered. As
appropriate for collision processes, these systems can be either in a pure quantum state
or in a mixture of diﬀerent states with any degree of coherence (Blum 1982, Balashov
et al. 2000). Density matrix theory helps to accompany such collision ensembles through
one or several regions of the interaction without loosing important information about
the reaction products. To support detailed collision studies, the concepts of the density
matrix has been implemented meanwhile into a number of codes which are suitable for
both, one- and few-electron ions (Fritzsche 2001, Surzhykov et al. 2004b).

4.2. Polarization studies for the K-shell capture

Details about the radiative capture can be derived not only from the angular distribution
of the emitted photons but also from their polarization (Surzhykov et al. 2001, Eichler &
Ichihara 2002). In practice, however, polarization measurements have been hampered in
the past years because of the lack of eﬃcient Compton polarimeters for photon energies
of several ten or even hundred keV. For high-Z ions with photon energies above 100 keV,
it was demonstrated only recently that the (linear) polarization of the emitted photons
can be measured by means of a new generation of segmented germanium detectors, which
allow for energy as well as position resolution (Inderhess et al. 1996, St¨ohlker et al. 2003).
A ﬁrst series of polarization measurements were performed at GSI using these detectors
(St¨ohlker et al. 2003, Tachenov et al. 2004) and by applying the dependence of the angle-
diﬀerential Compton scattering on the linear polarization of the incoming photons. As
predicted theoretically (Surzhykov et al. 2001, Eichler & Ichihara 2002), a strong linear
polarization of the K-REC photons is expected, which decreases in the forward direction
as the energy of the projectiles is enlarged. For bare uranium ions at 400 MeV/u, for
example, the photon polarization of the K-REC radiation has been analyzed at the jet-

Photon emission from highly charged heavy ions

target of the storage ring ESR. For this purpose, a planar germanium pixel detector was
used, mounted at an observation angle of 90◦. In the experiment, the photon polarization
is obtained by recording events which occur simultaneously in two pixels of the detector.
While one pixel is used to measure the Compton recoil electron (∆E), the other one
records the scattered photon (~ω
). A scatter plot of such coincident photon events is
displayed in Fig. 9. The large number of events in the diagonal corresponds to events
with a (constant) energy sum equal to the K-REC transition, i.e. EK−REC = ∆E + ~ω
.
It is important to mention that, for our initial energies (EK−REC ≈
250 keV), the
condition ∆E < ~ω
is always fulﬁlled which allows us also to identify the segment
where scattering takes place. The latter also explains the two maxima present in the 2D
scatter plot. In Fig. 9b, we compare the coincident sum energy spectrum for scattering
parallel (Ik) and perpendicular (I⊥) to the reaction plane (deﬁned by the ion beam and
the propagation direction of the K-REC photon). As seen from this ﬁgure, the K-REC
radiation appears strongly polarized within the scattering plane.

′

′

Experimentally, the polarization properties of the emitted photons are usually
obtained from the Stokes parameter, i.e., the intensity ratios of the light measured under
diﬀerent angles with respect to the reaction plane. For example, the Stokes parameter
I90o)/(I0o + I90o), is obtained from the intensities parallel and perpendicular
P1 = (I0o
to the scattering plane, while the parameter P2 follows from a similar intensity ratio,
taken at χ = 45o and χ = 135o, respectively. The two parameters P1 and P2 together
describe the (degree and direction of the) linear polarization in the plane perpendicular
to the photon momentum whereas the third parameter P3 denotes the degree of circular
polarization.

−

In the theoretical treatment of electron capture, the Stokes parameters are closely
related to the photon density matrix if no further information need to be retained for the
remaining ions apart from its level designation. For the capture of unpolarized electrons
by bare ions, it was shown recently (Surzhykov et al. 2003b, Fritzsche et al. 2003),
that only the Stokes parameter P1 is non-zero (and positive for moderate projectile
energies), while P2 is identically zero. This implies that, for unpolarized electrons and
ions, the polarization of the recombination photons will always be found within the
reaction plane. For the capture of polarized electrons, in contrast, the Stokes parameter
P2 becomes non-zero, in particular at small forward angles θ RR, leaving P1 unaﬀected in
this case. For the photon polarization, however, any non-zero P2 parameter results in a
rotation of the polarization ellipse out of the reaction plane. Owing to the symmetry of
the collision system, a similar result is found if the (unpolarized) electrons are captured
by a polarized ion beam. Therefore, the rotation of the polarization ellipse may serve
as a unique tool for measuring the polarization properties of ion beams (Surzhykov
et al. 2004a), a result which has attracted a lot of recent interest.

4.3. Emission of characteristic radiation

If the electron is captured not into the ground state of the ion, but into an excited
one, this ion state decays further towards the ground state under the emission of
characteristic radiation. For high-Z ions, in particular, the capture into the 2p3/2
level and its subsequent Lyman-α1 decay into the 1s ground state has been explored in
great detail. The angular distribution of this characteristic radiation,

W Ly(θ) = Wo (1 + β exp P2(cos θ)) ,

(1)

then allows to derive an (experimental) anisotropy parameter β exp as function of the
charge and the energy of the projectiles [cf. Fig. 8]. When compared to the standard
dipole approximation β =

anisotropy parameters β exp, where
the radiative electron capture (St¨ohlker et al. 1997, Eichler et al. 1998). Initially, this
large discrepancy was quite surprising since, even for hydrogen-like uranium, the dipole
approximation to the electron-photon interaction was known to provide (theoretical)
lifetimes with an accuracy of better or
1 %. A detailed analysis in the framework
of the density matrix theory later showed, however, that the increase in the observed
anisotropy arises entirely from to the weak M2 branch of the Lyman-α transitions, i.e.
from the interferences of the E1 and M2 multipole components (Surzhykov et al. 2002a).

f (E1, M2) is roughly proportional to Z 2 and, therefore, non-negligible eﬀects of a few
percent from the M2 multipole component may arise even for medium-Z ions.

Apart from the incorporation of higher multipoles, there is an alternative view
of how such interference eﬀects in high-Z ions can be used to obtain insight into the
interaction with the radiation ﬁeld.
If we assume, for instance, that the REC into
bare ions is well understood by means of the (relativistic) density matrix theory, we
may utilize the theoretical alignment for the capture into the 2p3/2 level in order to
derive the structure function f (E1, M2) also experimentally. Applied to the angular
distribution data from Fig. 10, a value f (exp) (E1, M2) = 1.27
0.05 is obtained, giving
rise to a relative contribution of the M2 decay branch of ΓM2/ΓE1 = 0.0077

4.4. Multiple photon emission: angular correlations

A great deal of information about the electron-photon interaction in the presence
of strong ﬁelds has been obtained from the x-ray spectra of either the REC or the
characteristic radiation. Further details can be derived if the photon emission from the
electron capture and the subsequent bound-bound decay are observed in coincidence.
Perhaps, the most simple coincidence measurement refers to the observation of the
angular-angular correlations which reﬂect the diﬀerential alignment in the population
of the magnetic sublevels as function of the observation angle of the recombination
photon. For the electron capture by U 92+ ions, a very strong dependence has been
predicted for the angular distribution of the subsequent photon decay (Surzhykov
et al. 2002b, Surzhykov et al. 2003a), using proper tools for the spin-angular and radial
integration (Fritzsche 1997, Surzhykov et al. 2004b). Other correlation functions can
be deﬁned and may lead to additional information about the polarization properties of
the emitted radiation in the future. The great advantage of such correlation studies is
that they provide an alternative route for determining the polarization properties of the
(heavy) ions beams at storage rings.

5. Conclusions and outlook

The photon emission from highly-charged heavy ions has been reviewed as observed
at storage rings. Studies on both, the bound-bound and free-bound transition in
high-Z ions, have revealed many details and have improved the understanding of the
electron-photon interaction in the strong-ﬁelds domain. These investigations clearly
show the inherently relativistic behavior of all the structure and collision processes
observed in high-energy atomic physics. In studying high-Z ions, the role of Quantum
Electrodynamics becomes predominant. It is thus conﬁrmed as the fundamental theory
for describing atomic and ionic systems.

For the capture of electrons into ionic bound states, an interference has been seen
between the diﬀerent multipole components in the expansion of the radiation ﬁeld.
These interference eﬀects have extended our knowledge about the photoionization of
atoms and ions to much higher energies than available for the neutral elements. They
demonstrate that magnetic and higher-order contributions of the radiation ﬁeld may
survive even for energies close to the threshold. Although these interference eﬀects
are observed so far only for the Lyman-α decay of hydrogen-like uranium, following
the electron capture into the 2p3/2 level, they are important also for other few-electron
systems if — apart from the leading E1 multipole — other multipole(s) are allowed
additionally. For the emitted photons, then, both the angular distributions and the
polarization properties are likely to be aﬀected.

There are further challenges to be faced in the forthcoming years, when studying
fundamental processes of high-Z ions. For the radiative recombination, coincidence
and polarization measurements will further advance our knowledge about the electron-

Photon emission from highly charged heavy ions

21

photon interaction as they are sensitive to diﬀerent components of the radiation ﬁeld.
As outlined above, moreover, REC may provide a tool for the diagnostics and detection
of spin-polarized ions in atomic collisions. When compared with accurate theoretical
predictions, the observation of the photon polarization then may help to control the
ion polarization in heavy-storage rings, a topic which has recently attracted much
attention in atomic and nuclear physics. With control on both, the generation and
the measurement of polarized ion beams, a whole class of new experiments will become
feasible, including the study of parity non-conserving (PNC) eﬀects (Maul et al. 1996)
or the search for electric dipole moments of highly-charged ions. Experimentally,
ideal conditions for such challenging studies will be provided by the new heavy ion
facilities presently under discussion, such as the new international accelerator Facility for
Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI(Henning 2001). There highest intensities
for beams of both stable and exotic heavy nuclei will become available.

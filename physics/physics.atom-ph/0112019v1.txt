Abstract

In this paper, we have investigated the correlated electron
emission of the nonsequence double ionization (NSDI) in an
intense linearly polarized ﬁeld. The theoretical model we em-
ployed is the semiclassical rescattering model, the model atom
we used is the helium. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation be-
tween magnitude and direction of the momentum of two emis-
sion electrons, and give a good explanation for this striking
phenomenon by observing the classical collisional trajecto-
ries. We argue that this correlation phenomenon is universal
in NSDI process, as revealed by the recent experiment on the
argon.

these experiments the single ionization of He in a lin-
early polarized ﬁeld is accurately predicted by the sin-
gle active electron (SAE) approximation [2], well de-
scribed by the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tun-
nelling theory [4]. However, the case of double ionization
is more complicated. In the regime of very high inten-
sities (I > 1016W/cm2) where strong double ionization
occurs, the double ionization keeps in good agreement
with the sequential SAE models as that in the lower in-
tensities regime(I < 1014W/cm2). The double ionization
deviates seriously from the sequential SAE model and
shows a great enhancement in a “knee” regime [(0.8—
3.0) × 1015W/cm2]. This surprising large yields of the
double ionization obviously indicates that the sequential
ionization is no longer the dominating process in this
regime and the electron-electron correlation has to be

electron process of the double ionization in a laser ﬁeld
have reproduced the main feature of the knee structure
in the double ionization yield as a function of laser peak
intensity and, moreover, yielded quantitative agreement
with the experiments in some cases [5,6].

The physical mechanism behind this nonsequential
process is, however, still debatable. Both the “shake-oﬀ”

model and the “recollision” model are suggested to de-
scribe the electron’s correlation [1,3,7,8]. However, none
of the two nonsequence double ionization (NSDI) mech-
anisms can completely explain the experimental obser-
vations. For the “shake-oﬀ” model, it can not give the
reason for the decrease in the double ionization yields
as the polarization of the laser ﬁeld departs from linear
[9–11]. In the “recollision” model, the returning electrons
are known to have a maximum classical kinetic energy
of ∼ 3.2Up (Up = e2F 2/4meω2), so one can determine
a minimum intensity required for the rescattering elec-
tron to have enough energy to excite the inner electron.
But the double ionization yields observed in experiments
has no such an intensity threshold.
In fact, the dou-
ble ionization process is rather complicated and subtle,
both of the two NSDI processes and the sequential ion-
ization have contributions to it and may dominate in the
diﬀerent regimes. In another aspect, Becker and Faisal
proposed a “correlated energy sharing” model to describe
the NSDI processes and nuclei recoil experiment [5,12,13].
The model is based on the so-called intense-ﬁeld many-
body S-matrix theory derived by a rearrangement of the
usual S-matrix series and include time electron correla-
tion and the rescattering mechanism.

We have employed the semiclassical model to study the
double ionization of helium in intense linearly polarized
ﬁeld [6,14]. Our calculations reproduced the excessive
double ionization and the photoelectron spectra observed
experimentally both quantitatively and qualitively, and
we argue that the classical collisional trajectories is the
main source of the nonsequence double ionization of he-
lium in the “knee” regime.

Recently, the observation of the correlated electron
emission in laser-induced double ionization of argon [15]
provided new insights into the NSDI process. These au-
thors reported a strong correlation between the direction
and the magnitude of the momenta of two electrons emit-
ted from an argon atom: the momenta of the two emis-
sion electrons tend to have the same magnitude and sign
in the polarization direction. On the theoretical side, by
solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for two
electrons in three dimensions, Taylor et al [16] gave that
the most of double ionization probability ﬂux tends to
emerge to the same side of the ion. Similar conclusions
have been drawn from one-dimensional model [17].

In this paper, based on the 3D semiclassical rescatter-
ing model developed recently [6,14], we investigate the
dynamical behavior of the correlated electrons in the dou-
ble ionization process by analyzing their classical trajec-

tories. This investigation, as shown later, is very helpful
to understand the physical mechanism behind the mo-
mentum correlation. The model atom we use is the he-
lium, however we argue that our discussions are available
to the other multi-electron atoms, like the argon in recent
experiment [15].

Firstly, we brieﬂy present the semiclassical rescatter-
ing model adopted in our calculations. The ionization of
the ﬁrst electron from bound state to the continues state
is treated by the tunnelling ionization theory generalized
by Delone et al. [18]. The subsequent evolution of the
ionized electron and the bound electron in the combined
Coulomb potential and the laser ﬁelds is described by a
classical Newtonian equation. To emulate the evolution
of the electron, a set of trajectories is launched with ini-
tial conditions taken into from the wave function of the
tunnelling electron.

The evolution of the two electrons after the ﬁrst elec-
tron tunnelled are described by the classical equations
(in atomic unit):

d2ri
dt2 = −∇(V i

n + Vee) − F(t), i = 1, 2.

(1)

Here F(t) = F cos(ωt)~ez is the laser ﬁeld. The indices
i = 1 and 2 refer to the tunnel ionized and bound electron
respectively. The potentials are

V i
n = −

, Vee =

2
|ri|

|r1 − r2|

(2)

The initial condition of the tunnelled electron, under
the SAE approximation of He+, is determined by a equa-
tion including the eﬀective potential given in Ref. [19]
and a generalized tunnelling formula developed by De-
lone et al. [18]. In parabolic coordinates, the Schr¨odinger
equation for a hydrogen-like atom in a uniform ﬁeld ǫ is
written (in atomic unit),

the form of

The above equation has

the one-
dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with the potential
U (η) = −1/4η − 1/8η2 − ǫη/8 and the energy K = Ip1
4 .
The evolution of the outer electron is traced by launch-
ing a set of trajectories with diﬀerent initial parameters
t0 and v1x0, where v1x0 is the initial velocity perpendic-
ular to the polarization of the electric ﬁeld. The ini-
tial position of the electron born at time t0 is given by
x10 = y10 = 0 , z10 = −η0/2 from the Eq. (3). The
initial velocity is set to be v1y0 = v1z0 = 0, v1x0 = v10.
Thus, the weight of each trajectory is evaluated by [18]

w(t0, v10) = w(0)w(1),

w(1) =

and where w(0) is the tunnelling rate in the quasistatic
approximation [20].

The initial state of the bounded electron is described
by assuming that the electron is in the ground state of
He+ with energy E2 = −2.0 a.u. and its initial distribu-
tion is microcanonical distribution [21,6].

In our calculation, the Eqs. (1) are solved in a time
interval between t0 and 15T by employing the standard
Runge-Kuta algorithm. During the ﬁrst ten optical cy-
cles the electric ﬁeld amplitude is constant, and then the
ﬁeld is switched oﬀ using a cos2 envelope during three
cycles, and during the last two optical cycles the elec-
trons is free from the electric ﬁeld. The wavelength is
λ = 780 nm, which is so chosen to match the experiment
[2,23], and the intensity of laser is I = 1 × 1015W/cm2
which is right at the ‘knee’ region of the double ioniza-
tion of helium. 106 or more initial points are randomly
distributed in the parameter plane −π/2 < ωt0 < 3π/2,
v1x0 > 0 for the outer electron and in the microcanoni-
cal distribution for the inner electron. The distribution
for the ionization electron can be obtained by making
statistics on an ensemble of classical trajectories weighed
by the (4). The results have been tested for numerical
convergence by increasing the number of trajectories.

Figure 1 shows the momentum correlation between the
two emission electrons in the double ionization of the
present calculations. The horizontal axis shows the mo-
mentum component of the ﬁrst electron in the direction
of polarization (P1z) and the vertical axis the same mo-
mentum component of the second electron (P2z). This
ﬁgure shows a strong correlation between the momenta
of the two electrons. There is a clear maximum for both
electrons being emitted with the same momentum com-
ponent in the direction of polarization axis of about 2.7
a.u., and emission to opposite half planes is strongly sup-
pressed, i.e., both two electrons tend to ﬂy to same side of
ion in the direction of polarization. This phenomena has
been observed in the ‘knee’ region for argon [15]. On the
other hand, from Fig. 1, we see that the maximum mo-
mentum of both electron is about 4.5 a.u.,which is consist
with the electron-ion coincidence experiment observation
of helium [23], in which the maximum energy of emission
electron in NSDI process is 4Up, since the perpendicular
component of momentum is small, the maximum mo-
mentum component in the polarization direction can be
approximate obtained as Pz max =

8Up ≃ 4 a.u..

p

An useful alternative perspective on Fig. 2 is obtained
by rotating the distribution by 45◦. Then we can get two
new distributions. In Fig. 2(a), we show the distribution
of the sum momentum P + = (P1z +P2z); In Fig. 2(b), we
show the distribution of the diﬀerence momentum P − =
(P1z − P2z). Owing to momentum conservation, the sum
momentum of emission electrons is equal and opposite
to the He2+ recoil ion momentum [22,14], so its distri-
bution, as we know, shows a characteristic double-hump
structure with a central minima. A vast amount of litera-
ture has devoted to discuss the double-hump structure of
momenta of recoil ions [22,14], here we only pay attention

to the correlation between the two emission electrons.

Comparing the Fig.2(a) with Fig.2(b), one ﬁnds that
the sum momentum at the peak is about 4.3 a.u., al-
most above the maximum momentum of each electron,
and the maximum sum momentum is almost 8.7 a.u.,
about twice of the maximum momentum of one electron;
furthermore the distribution width of diﬀerence moment
is much smaller than the one of the sum momentum.
These features indicate the momenta parallel to polar-
ization axis of the two emission electrons likely have the
same direction. On the other hand, the peak of the dis-
tribution of diﬀerence momentum is at zero, so the mo-
menta of the two emission electron tend to have the equal
magnitude.

To study the origin of the correlation of electrons emis-
sion, we show two trajectories of the electrons in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3(a) shows a typical trajectory of which the dif-
ference momentum in polarization direction is small and
ﬁg. 3(b) shows a typical trajectory of which the diﬀerence
momentum in polarization direction is nearly the maxi-
mum. From these trajectories, it can be concluded that
after the second electron ionized the momentum trans-
fer received from the laser ﬁeld is almost identical for
both electron. Because the electron can obtain very high
energy from the laser, the momenta of the two thus be
accelerated to the same direction. On the other hand,
this part of the acceleration only adds to the sum of the
momenta of the two electrons, but does not change the
diﬀerence of the momenta. Therefore the diﬀerence of the
momenta is only determined by the ionization process of
the second electron.

As we have discussed before, the second electron is
mostly ionized by the “recollision” mechanism: the sec-
ond electron is ionized by a collision with the tunnelled
electron [6]. Because the collision between the two elec-
trons is almost instantaneous so that the energy is con-
served approximately when the collision happens. The
total energy of the two electron can be expressed by

E = ET +

where ET includes the potentials and the kinetic energy
of the perpendicular parts. To the best of our knowl-
edge, so far the energy distribution of the returning elec-
tron has not been reported, but we believe that it ex-
hibits a peak at zero energy and decreases as the energy
increasing, on the other hand, only the returning elec-
tron which energy is above the ionization potential of the
bound electron Ip2 can cause the second electron ionized,
so the total energy of the two electrons soon after the col-
lision occurred is small and its distribution peaks at zero.
Therefore the P − is more likely zero, i.e., the momen-
tum components in the polarization direction of the two
emission electrons are likely equal to each other. The re-
turning electrons are known to have a maximum classical
kinetic energy of ∼ 3.2Up, therefore the maximum diﬀer-
ence momentum must satisfy
≃ 3.2Up − Ip2,

P1z−P2z

so |P −|max = 2

p

3.2Up − Ip2 ≃ 4.2 a.u..
On the other hand, since the total energy of the two
electrons soon after the collision occurring is small, the
total ﬁnal energy of the two emission electrons mostly
reﬂect the energy transfer received from the ﬁeld. The
ﬁeld acceleration make the sum momentum increase. The
maximum energy for an electron in the double ionization
process is about 4Up [23], from Eq. (6), assuming the two
emission electron have the same energy, we can obtain
the maximum sum momentum |P +|max ≃ 8 a.u.. This
indicates that the joint acceleration of the electrons in
the laser ﬁeld clearly dominates over the inﬂuence of the
electron repulsion, and both electrons ionized are driven
by the laser to the same side.

In conclusion, we have investigated the momentum
correlation between magnitude and direction of the two
emission electrons in nonsequence double ionization. The
numerical results on the helium show a signiﬁcant corre-
lation on the momentum of the two electrons: the emis-
sion electrons tend to have the same momentum com-
ponent in the polarization direction. The phenomena
can be directly comprehended from the classical colli-
sional trajectories. These discussions suggest that the
correlated electrons emission in double ionization pro-
cess is a semiclassical process. We also evaluated the
width of distribution of the sum and diﬀerence momen-
tum. Because the diﬀerence momentum is only deter-
mined by the ionization process, so it is important to ver-
ify the dominating process in the “knee” regime. Based
on the rescattering model, we argue that the maximum
diﬀerence momentum of the two emission electrons is
|P −|max = 2
3.2Up − Ip2. The predictions coincide with
the argon experiment [15]. We hope our discussions will
stimulate the experimental works on the helium in the
direction.

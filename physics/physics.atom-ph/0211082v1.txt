(Dated: January 15, 2014)

Ab initio theory is developed for radiative transitions between excited states of neon. Calculations
of energies for even excited states J=1, J=2 supplement our previous calculations for J=1 odd excited
states. Line strengths for transitions between J=1 odd and J=1,2 even states of Ne I are evaluated.
A comparison with experiments and semiempirical calculations is given.

INTRODUCTION

Development of ab initio theories for neutral open-
shell atoms is a diﬃcult task since the interaction be-
tween electrons of an open shell is strong and cannot be
treated perturbatively. Nevertheless, some progress in
two-valence and even three-valence electron atoms has
been achieved with the combination of conﬁguration-
interaction (CI) method and many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) [1, 2, 3]. Particle-hole states of closed-
shell atoms have additional diﬃculty that conventional
perturbation theory does not converge for hole states. We
solved the convergence problem by modifying denomina-
tors [3, 4]. As a result, we were able to achieve agreement
with experiment for neon energies of J=1 odd excited
states and oscillator strengths (averaged over many mea-
surements) of transitions to the ground state. In this pa-
per, we extend our application of the CI+MBPT method
to neon transition between excited states. If we succeed,
our understanding of neon atom and low-Z neonlike ions
will be substantially improved

Fairly accurate (about 5%) measurements of many
transition rates between excited states are available, pro-
viding important tests of theory. In addition, semiem-
pirical calculations can be compared with our calcula-
tions. For example, many transition rates along the
neon isoelectronic sequence were calculated by Hibbert
et al. [5] with a general conﬁguration-interaction code
(CIV3) [6].
In calculations a few parameters were ad-
justed to ﬁt experimental energies. However, even after
such adjustments, the results still disagreed signiﬁcantly
with other semiempirical calculations by Seaton [7] and
experiments. The latter theory was more successful, giv-
ing results in close agreement with experiments. No pure
ab initio theory, as far as we know, was (successfully)
applied previously to calculations of transitions between
neon excited states. For transitions to the ground state,
elaborate ab initio calculations exist (Avgoustoglou and
Beck [8]), but agreement with experiment for an oscilla-

factory. These calculations are more eﬀective in heavier
noble-gas atoms, where the agreement with experiment is
achieved for Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms. In neon, on the other
hand, our new calculations with CI+MBPT method, give
results close to the average experimental values.

It is a well-known fact that neon transitions between
excited states are sensitive to the accuracy of ﬁne-
structure splittings. Semiempirical theories avoid this
diﬃculty by introducing and adjusting several parame-
ters to match energies of multiplets as precisely as possi-
ble. For example, using quantum defect method, Seaton
[7] was able to obtain very small root-mean square devia-
tions for energies. As a result, he also was able to obtain
transition oscillator strengths that agree well with ex-
periment. Getting accurate ﬁne structure intervals with-
out parametric adjustments is a challenging task. We
will demonstrate in this paper that CI calculations cor-
rected with second-order MBPT give energies and os-
cillator strengths for transitions between excited states
with the precision comparable to the precision of best
semiempirical calculations.

The transition data in neon and other noble gases are
needed for plasma physics and studies of discharges with
many industrial applications in lamps and gas lasers. The
opacity project [9] is another motivation behind many
calculations (one example is given in Ref. [10]) in neon-
like ions. Understanding of neon atom can be beneﬁcial
for the development of atomic structure methods which
are needed for many applications. One important ap-
plication of atomic structure is calculations of parity-
nonconservation amplitudes in heavy atoms with one or
a few valence electrons which require a clear understand-
ing of correlation eﬀects in these atoms. One-valence-
electron MBPT has similar convergence problems to the
hole MBPT after a core is excited. Modiﬁcation of de-
nominators according to our prescription might be one
key to the solution of a puzzling problem that third-order
energy in Cs agrees worse with experiment than second-
order energy. Calculations of electron dipole moments
in particle-hole atoms is another, more direct application
of our particle-hole theory. Furthermore, the CI+MBPT
method and convergent hole perturbation theory can be
generalized for more complicated atoms with more than

one particle or hole and properties of these atoms can be
explored beyond Hartree-Fock approximation.

In this paper, ﬁrst we will brieﬂy describe our method
of calculations (more details are given in Ref. [3, 4]); then,
we will compare CI+MBPT and experimental energies
for J=1 and J=2 even states. This comparison gives an
estimate on accuracy of our wave functions. Next, we will
show our results for transition line strengths. Finally, we
compare our theory with other semiempirical calculations
and experiments.

II. CI+MBPT CALCULATIONS

A. Energies and oscillator strengths for J=1 odd
neon states

The Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger variant of

second-order
MBPT, given in Ref. [11], has low accuracy for neon
(does not improve lowest order approximation), there-
fore we developed a fast convergent variant of MBPT
[3, 4]. This perturbation theory can be understood
from couple-cluster single-double equations [12]. Sim-
ply put, we modify some denominators in the pertur-
bation terms to take into account the strong interac-
tion between a hole and a core electron or between core
electrons non-perurbatively. The advantage of this ap-
proach compared to the couple-cluster method of [12]
is simplicity and speed of calculations. With our fast
convergent MBPT method, we are able to improve the
accuracy of hole energies and ﬁne-structure splittings
of light neonlike ions already after adding second-order
MBPT corrections. Apart from Coulomb correlation
corrections, the Breit magnetic interaction is also in-
cluded, but small frequency-dependent Breit, quantum-
reduced-mass, and mass-polarization
electrodynamic,
corrections are omitted (the analysis of these small cor-
rections is given in Ref. [12].

To calculate particle-hole energies, we construct a
model CI space [11], compute eﬀective Hamiltonian in
this space, which also includes second-order MBPT cor-
rections, and solve an eigen value problem. Along with
energies we obtain wave functions, which were used to
calculate oscillator strengths for transitions to the ground
states [3, 4]. The energies of neon particle-hole J=1 odd
states and oscillator strengths were in very good agree-
ment with experiment after using a relatively small CI
space, 52. Pure ab initio energies diﬀered from experi-
mental energies by 0.0069 a.u., but after subtraction of
the systematic shift (which does not make much diﬀer-
ence in transition calculations), the agreement was im-
proved to the level of 0.0001 a.u.
for almost all states.
We will use the same wave functions for J=1 odd states in
our calculations of transitions from J=1 odd to J=1 and
J=2 even states. The accuracy of energies of even states
involved in the transitions will be illustrated below.

B. Energies for J=2 and J=1 even neon states

In this section we present our calculations of energies
for even states. We use the same formalism and numeri-
cal method as in Ref. [3, 4]. The spline cavity is chosen
80 a.u., the number of splines is chosen 40, and the max-
imum orbital momentum is chosen 5. For excited states,
a V N −1 Hartree-Fock (HF) potential basis (see [3]) is
built from HF V N spline basis by diagonalization of a
one-electron Hamiltonian to take into account the major
part of the interaction of an excited electron with a hole.
Such procedure speeds up the convergence of CI and re-
duces uncertainty in denominators of a perturbation the-
ory. A V N −1 HF basis used in Ref. [12] was constructed
by solving diﬀerential HF equations and gives similar re-
sults, but our basis does not require rewriting HF code
and therefore is more convenient. The calculations of
energies are shown in two tables.

In Table I we compare with experiment our theoreti-
cal energies of J=1 even states. Energies calculated in
a model space of size 32 agree better with experiment
than energies calculated in smaller size (8) model space.
CI space 32 can be considered as optimal since a larger
number of conﬁgurations does not improve much accu-

racy. Note that the size of optimal CI space depends on
the choice of a starting potential since inadequate ini-
tial approximation is corrected by diagonalization of the
CI matrix. An 1% systematic shift is present, which can
be attributed to inaccuracy of hole energies; however this
shift does not aﬀect much accuracy of transition rates and
is relatively unimportant. More important for weaker
transitions is the fact that after subtracting this shift,
we obtain very small residual deviations, which bode well
for the accuracy of singlet-triplet mixing coeﬃcients and
transition amplitudes.

Similar agreement of energies is obtained for J=2 even
states in Table II. Again, we have almost the same sys-
tematic shift, and after its subtraction, only a very small
diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical energies
remains. Therefore, we have reason to expect good preci-
sion for transitions between the excited states which are
considered next.

C. Transitions between neon excited states

Previously, we calculated oscillator strengths for the
transitions to the ground state; the formula for excited
state transitions is diﬀerent. The ﬁnal expression for the
coupled reduced matrix element after angular reduction

in j-j relativistic basis has the following form:

hF kZJ k Ii =

)CI (a, v)×

δa′a hv′

kZJ k vi +

δv′v ha kZJ k a′

i
(cid:27)

We use standard notations of relativistic MBPT meth-
ods, see for example [14]. Conﬁguration weights of the
ﬁnal CF (a′v′) and the initial CI (a, v) states are obtained
in CI calculations. Note that this formula is similar to
but diﬀerent from that for the transitions between two-
particle states [14] even if we neglect small hole-hole ma-
trix elements. However, it is possible to modify wave
functions to use two-particle matrix elements, which can
be convenient if the program for calculations of two-
particle matrix elements are available.

Tables III and IV show our results of calculations for
J=1-J=1 and J=1-J=2 excited state transitions. Many
precisely measured (5% level) neon transition rates pro-
vide an important test of accuracy of our calculations.
In Table III, the calculations are done with two numbers
of conﬁgurations to show improvement in precision for
the larger number of conﬁgurations. Important random-
phase approximation (RPA) corrections are included by
replacing “bare” matrix element with “dressed”, RPA
matrix elements (the replacement for two-valence elec-
tron atoms was implemented in [2, 3]). Including RPA
corrections needs some care because a hole state present
when the transition between excited states occurs leads
to the convergence problem and low accuracy of the reg-
ular RPA corrections. Our standard cure is to mod-
ify denominators by subtracting radial Slatter integral
R0(abab) thus taking into account the monopole inter-
action of a hole with a core electron. This modiﬁcation
of denominators approximately halves RPA corrections.
Adding divided by 2 normal RPA corrections, we esti-
mated the level of these corrections and found that they
are important and improve agreement with experiment.
In neon, the corrections constitute a few percent part of
a total matrix element, but in heavier noble gas atoms,
they are even larger and more important. In the last col-
umn, we place our best values calculated in CI-32 model
space with appropriate modiﬁed-denominator RPA cor-
rections.

The deviation from experiment is consistent with the
experimental accuracy (for example, the accuracy of class

4

“B” is in the range 5% and the deviation from theory is of
the same magnitude). For transitions which have exper-
imental accuracy of classes “B-” and “C+”, the theory
is as accurate as or even more accurate than experiment,
but for the class “D”, the theory is deﬁnitely more ac-
curate. Still the accuracy of theory is not the same for
all transitions, since some suppressed transitions owing
to cancellation could be more sensitive to ﬁne-structure
splittings.

Our ﬁnal table (Table V) contains our best values of
oscillator strengths with the RPA corrections for com-
parison with experiments and other theories. Oscillator
strengths are calculated from line strengths S and tran-
sition energies ω in atomic units.

Due to a large number of measurements and calculations
we restricted ourselves to comparison with results from a
few sources, which contain further references; for exam-
ple, references to many experiments and comparison with
several measurements are given by Bridges and Wiese [13]
where the authors also estimated uncertainties of their
experiment to be about 7% and of the others shown in
their comparison table to be in the range 10-50%. The
experiments seem to be in good agreement with each
other. NIST data derived from various sources are in
close agreement with values given by Bridges and Wiese
[13]. The agreement with experiment of the semiempir-
ical theory by Seaton [7] is similar to the agreement of
our ab initio theory. Calculations performed by Hibbert
et al. [5] agree worse; for example, for the 6130 ˚A transi-
tion, an experimental value is 0.0114 or 0.0119, our value
is 0.0109, but the value in Ref. [5] is 0.0249. Overall
agreement of theories and experiments is quite normal.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have applied CI+MBPT theory for
particle-hole states of closed-shell atoms to calculations
of transitions between excited states of neon. A diﬃculty
that the hole energy has poor convergence is overcome
with modiﬁcations of denominators in MBPT. Good pre-
cision for particle-hole states is illustrated for many en-
ergy levels of neon. Apart from energies, our theory is
tested in calculations of line strengths. Agreement with
experimental values is achieved.

Abstract

The two-electron self-energy contribution to the ground state energy of helium-
like ions is calculated both for a point nucleus and an extended nucleus in a wide
interval of Z. All the two-electron contributions are compiled to obtain most accu-
rate values for the two-electron part of the ground state energy of heliumlike ions
in the range Z = 20 − 100. The theoretical value of the ground state energy of
238U 90+, based on currently available theory, is evaluated to be −261382.9(8) eV,
without higher order one-electron QED corrections.

1 Introduction

The recent progress in heavy-ion spectroscopy provides good perspectives for testing the
quantum electrodynamics in a region of strong electric ﬁeld. In [1, 2] the two-electron
contribution to the ground-state energy of some heliumlike ions was measured directly
In such an
by comparing the ionization energies of heliumlike and hydrogenlike ions.
experiment the dominating one-electron contributions are completely eliminated. Though
the accuracy of the experimental results is not high enough at present, it is expected [2]
that the experimental accuracy will be improved by up to an order of magnitude in the
near future. This will provide testing the QED eﬀects in the second order in α.

In this paper we calculate the ground state two-electron self-energy correction in the
second order in α in the range Z = 20−100. Calculations of this correction were previously
performed for some ions for the case of a point nucleus by Yerokhin and Shabaev [3] and
for an extended nucleus by Persson et al.
[4, 5]. Contrary our previous calculation of
this correction, the full-covariant scheme, based on an expansion of the Dirac-Coulomb
propagator in terms of interactions with the external potential [6, 7], is used in the present
work. This technique was already applied by the authors to calculate the self-energy
correction to the hyperﬁne splitting in hydrogenlike and lithiumlike ions [8, 9].

The paper is organized as follows. In the Sec. 2 we give a brief outline of the calculation
In the Sec. 3 we summarize all the two-

electron contributions to the ground state energy of heliumlike ions. The relativistic units
(¯h = c = 1) are used in the paper.

2 Self-energy contribution

The two-electron self-energy contribution is represented by the Feynman diagrams in
Fig.1. The formal expressions for these diagrams can easily be derived by the two-time
Green function method [10]. Such a derivation was discussed in detail in [3]. The diagrams
in Fig.1a are conveniently divided into irreducible and reducible parts. The reducible part
is the one in which the intermediate state energy (between the self-energy loop and the
electron-electron interaction line) coincides with the initial state energy. The irreducible
part is the remaining one. The contribution of the irreducible part can be written in the
same form as the ﬁrst order self-energy

∆Eirred = 2

hξ|ΣR(εa)|ai + ha|ΣR(εa)|ξi
h

i

,

where ΣR(ε) is the regularized self-energy operator, εa is the energy of the initial state a,
and |ξi is a perturbed wave function deﬁned by

|ξi =

=εa
Xεn

|ni [hnb|I(0)|abi − hnb|I(0)|bai]
εa − εn

.

Here I(ω) is the operator of the electron-electron interaction. The calculation of the
irreducible part is carried out using the scheme suggested by Snyderman [6] for the ﬁrst
order self-energy contribution.

The reducible part is grouped with the vertex part (Fig.1b). For the sum of these

terms the following formal expression is obtained

Here the ﬁrst term corresponds to the vertex part, and the second one corresponds to the
reducible part. G(ε, x, z) is the Coulomb Green function, α is the ﬁne structure constant,
αµ = (1, α), α are the Dirac matrices, a and b are the 1s states with spin projection
m = ± 1

2 , and P is the permutation operator.

According to the Ward identity the counterterms for the vertex and reducible parts
cancel each other, and, so, the sum of these terms regularized in the same covariant way
is ultraviolet ﬁnite. To cancel the ultraviolet divergences analytically we divide ∆Evr
into two parts ∆Evr = ∆E(0)
. The ﬁrst term is ∆Evr with both the bound
electron propagators replaced by the free propagators. It does not contain the Coulomb
Green functions and can be evaluated in the momentum representation, where all the
ultraviolet divergences are explicitly cancelled using a standard covariant regularization
procedure. The remainder ∆Emany
does not contain ultraviolet divergent terms and is

vr + ∆Emany

calculated in the coordinate space. The infrared divergent terms are handled introducing
a small photon mass µ. After these terms are separated and cancelled analytically the
limit µ → 0 is taken.

In practice the calculation of the self-energy contribution is made using the shell model
of the nuclear charge distribution. Since the ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect is small enough even
for high Z (it constitutes about 1.5 percent for uranium), an error due to incompleteness
of such a model is negligible. The Green function for the case of the shell nucleus in the
form presented in [11] is used in the calculation. To calculate the part of ∆Eirred with
two and more external potentials, we subtract from the Coulomb-Dirac Green function
the ﬁrst two terms of its potential expansion numerically. To obtain the second term of
the expansion it is necessary to evaluate a derivative of the Coulomb Green function with
respect to Z at the point Z = 0. We handle it using some algorithms suggested in [12].

The numerical evaluation of ∆Emany

is the most time consuming part of the calcula-
tion. The energy integration is carried out using the Gaussian quadratures after rotating
the integration contour into imaginary axis. To achieve a desirable precision it is suﬃcient
to calculate 12-15 terms of the partial wave expansion. The remainder is evaluated by ﬁt-
ting the partial wave contributions to a polynomial in 1
l . A contribution arising from the
intermediate electron states which are of the same energy as the initial state is calculated
separately using the B-spline method for the Dirac equation [13]. The same method is
used for the numerical evaluation of the perturbed wave function |ξi in equation (1).

Table 1 gives the numerical results for the two-electron self-energy contribution to the
ground state energy of heliumlike ions expressed in terms of the function F (αZ) deﬁned
by

∆E = α2(αZ)3F (αZ) mc2

(4)

To the lowest order in αZ, F = 1.346 ln Z − 5.251 (see [3] and references therein). The
results for a point nucleus and an extended nucleus are listed in the third and fourth
In the second column the values of the root-mean-
columns of the table, respectively.
square (rms) nuclear charge radii used in the calculation are given [14, 15]. In the ﬁfth
column the results for an extended nucleus expressed in eV are given to be compared with
the ones of Persson et al. [4] listed in the last column of the table. A comparison of the
present results for a point nucleus with the ones from [3] ﬁnds some discrepancy for the
contribution which corresponds to the Breit part of the electron-electron interaction. This
discrepancy results from a small spurious term arising in the non-covariant regularization
procedure used in [3].

3 The two-electron part of the ground state energy

In the Table 2 we summarize all the two-electron contributions to the ground state energy
of heliumlike ions. In the second column of the table the energy contribution due to one-
photon exchange is given. Its calculation is carried out for the Fermi model of the nuclear
charge distribution

ρ(r) =

with the rms charge radii listed in the Table 1. Following to [14], the parameter a is
chosen to be a = 2.3
4 ln 3 fm. The parameters c and N, with a good precision, are given by
(see, e.g., [16])

Except for Z=83, 92, the uncertainty of this correction is obtained by a one percent
variation of the rms radii. In the case Z=92 (hr2i1/2 = 5.860(2) fm [17]), the uncertainty
of this correction is estimated by taking the diﬀerence between the corrections obtained
with the Fermi model and the homogeneously charged sphere model of the same rms
radius. For Z = 83, the uncertainty comes from both a variation of the rms radius by
0.020 fm (it corresponds to a discrepancy between the measured rms values [14]) and the
diﬀerence between the Fermi model and the homogeneously charged sphere model.

The energy contribution due to two-photon exchange is divided into two parts. The
ﬁrst one (”non-QED contribution”) includes the non-relativistic contribution and the low-
est order (∼ (αZ)2) relativistic correction, which can be derived from the Breit equation.
This is given by the ﬁrst two terms in the αZ-expansion [18, 19, 20]

and is presented in the third column of the Table 2. The second part which we refer to
as the ”QED contribution” is the residual and is given in the fourth column of the table.
The data for the two-photon contribution for all Z, except for Z = 92, are taken from
[21], interpolation is made when it is needed. For Z = 92 data from [22] are taken. In
the ﬁfth column of the table the results of the present calculation of the two-electron self-
energy contribution are given. The two-electron vacuum polarization contribution taken
from [23] is listed in the sixth column. In the seventh column the ”non-QED part” of the
energy correction due to exchange of three and more photons is given. This correction is
1 expansion terms for the ground state energy of heliumlike
evaluated by summing the Z −
3. The coeﬃcients of such an expansion are taken to zeroth order
ions beginning from Z −
in αZ from [18] and to second order in αZ from [20]. The three and more photons QED
correction has not yet been calculated. We assume that the uncertainty due to omitting
this correction is of order of magnitude of the total second-order QED correction multiplied
1. It is given in the eighth column of the table. The two-electron nuclear
by factor Z −
recoil correction is estimated by reducing the one-photon exchange contribution by the
factor (1 − m/M). Such an estimate corresponds to the non-relativistic treatment of
this eﬀect and takes into account that the mass-polarization correction is negligible for
the (1s)2 state [20]. This correction and its uncertainty, which is taken to be 100% for
high Z, are included into the total two-electron contribution. The two-electron nuclear
polarization eﬀect is expected to be negligible for the ground state of heliumlike ions. In
the last column the total two-electron part of the ground state energy of heliumlike ions
is given.

In the Table 3 our results are compared with the experimental data [1, 2] and the results
of previous calculations based on the uniﬁed method [20], the all-order relativistic many
body perturbation theory (RMBPT) [24], the multiconﬁguration Dirac Fock treatment

4

[25], and RMBPT with the complete treatment of the two-electron QED correction [4, 5].
Data in the third column of the table are taken from [4] for Z = 54, 92 and from [5] for
other Z. The one-electron contribution from [15] is subtracted from the total ionization
energies presented in [24, 20] to obtain the two-electron part.

In the Table 4 we present the theoretical contributions to the ground state energy of
238U 90+, based on currently available theory. The uncertainty of the one-electron Dirac-
Coulomb value comes from the uncertainty of the Rydberg constant (we use hcR
eV, α=1/137.0359895(61)). The one-electron nuclear size correction for the Fermi distri-
bution with hr2i1/2 = 5.860 fm gives 397.62(76) eV. The uncertainty of this correction is
estimated by taking the diﬀerence between the corrections obtained with the Fermi model
and the homogeneously charged sphere model of the same rms radius [26]. The nuclear re-
coil correction was calculated to all orders in αZ by Artemyev et al. [27]. The uncertainty
of this correction is chosen to include a deviation from a point nucleus approximation used
in [27]. The one-electron nuclear polarization eﬀect was evaluated by Plunien and Soﬀ
[28] and by Neﬁodov et al.
[29]. The values of the ﬁrst order self-energy and vacuum
polarization corrections are taken from [30] and [31], respectively. The two-electron cor-
rections are quoted from the Table 2. The higher order one-electron QED corrections are
omitted in this summary since they have not yet been calculated completely. We expect
they can contribute within several electron volts.

Abstract

The recombination rate for three identical bosons has been calculated to test the limits of its

universal behavior.

It has been obtained for several diﬀerent collision energies and scattering

lengths a up to 105 a.u., giving rates that vary over 15 orders of magnitude. We ﬁnd that universal

behavior is limited to the threshold region characterized by E <
∼

¯h2/2µ12a2, where E is the total

energy and µ12 is the two-body reduced mass. The analytically predicted inﬁnite series of resonance

peaks and interference minima is truncated to no more than three of each for typical experimental

parameters.

The development of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with tunable properties makes

possible condensates with a wide range of interaction strengths. Several experiments [1, 2, 3,

4, 5] have investigated these properties by changing the atomic interactions with an external

magnetic ﬁeld near a diatomic Feshbach resonance. As is well-known, these interactions are

characterized at low temperatures by the two-body scattering length a, which covers the full

continuum of positive and negative values near the Feshbach resonance. In fact, all of the

essential properties of BECs are determined by the scattering length.

Because the two-body scattering length is the only relevant parameter, the precise shape

of the two-body potential does not matter for the many-body physics. One of the remarkable

results to emerge from recent work on ultracold collisions is that this property holds even

for the low temperature three-body physics. This shape independence has allowed theorists

to choose any convenient two-body potential that reproduces the desired scattering length.

We will again exploit this freedom in the present work to study three-body recombination.

Three-body recombination is the process by which three free atoms collide to form a diatomic

molecule and an unbound atom, setting free enough kinetic energy to make both atom and

molecule escape from typical traps.

The universal behavior of the three-body recombination rate makes it possible to derive

analytical expressions for a > 0 [6, 7, 8] and for a < 0 [9]. In the former case, theory predicts

an inﬁnite number of minima in the rate as the scattering length goes to positive inﬁnity;

and in the latter case, an inﬁnite number of maxima as the scattering length goes to negative

inﬁnity. The physics behind both features is closely related to the Eﬁmov eﬀect [10]. In

fact, it has been suggested that measuring the recombination rate while tuning through a

Feshbach resonance might make possible some of the ﬁrst direct experimental evidence of

this intriguing eﬀect.

Tuning through such Feshbach resonances can dramatically limit the density and lifetime

of BECs, however, since the three-body recombination rate was predicted [6, 7, 8, 9, 11] —

and recently veriﬁed experimentally [4] — to increase with the scattering length as a4. More

recently, three-body recombination has been used to create composite bosons by pairing

fermions in ultracold gases [12, 13]. The ultimate goal of this endeavor has recently been

achieved with the observation of Bose-condensed pairs of fermion atoms [14]. Despite its

importance and recent advances, much work remains for the theory of three-body recom-

bination. In particular, the universal behavior of the recombination rate has not yet been

2

tested by accurate calculations.

In this Letter, we show that the recombination rate for identical bosons is universal

only for collision energies in the threshold regime. Generically, the threshold regime is

characterized by k

1, or equivalently, when the collision energy is the smallest energy in

the system. For positive scattering lengths, the energy scale is set by the two-body binding

a

<
∼

energy; for negative scattering lengths, by the height of a potential barrier or, in some

cases, by a two-body shape resonance. Therefore, for a ﬁxed total three-body energy E,
the relation E <
E12 indicates when the system is in the threshold regime where universal
∼
behavior is expected. In this expression, E12 = ¯h2/2µ12a2 is the two-body binding energy

and µ12 is the two-body reduced mass.

The experimental consequences of restricting the range of universal behavior are striking.

At any nonzero temperature, rather than observing an inﬁnite series of resonances or minima,

only a ﬁnite number of either will be observable as the scattering length is scanned from

−∞
— and even those will be washed out. For instance, at 1 nK, only three resonances

to +

∞

and three minima can be hoped to be seen.

We will further show that the analytical formulas derived in Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9] hold only

at zero energy. At ﬁnite energies, when the scattering length is tuned out of the threshold

regime (E > E12), the analytical formulas break down because they do not take proper

account of three important ﬁnite energy eﬀects: unitarity, thermal averaging, and higher

partial waves. Unitarity limits the rate to ﬁnite values at ﬁnite temperatures for large

scattering lengths, and leads to a saturation eﬀect [4, 15]. Thermal averaging takes account

of the fact that experiments are performed at ﬁxed temperature rather than ﬁxed collision

energy, and higher partial waves must always be included, in principle. A generalized Wigner

threshold law [16] guarantees that the J π = 0+ contribution dominates at threshold, where

J is the total orbital angular momentum and π is the overall parity. The next leading

contribution, 2+, grows with energy as E2 and with scattering length as a8, and can quickly

become comparable to the 0+ rate.

We obtain the recombination rates by solving the Schr¨odinger equation numerically us-

ing the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (see Refs. [7, 16, 17, 18] for details of our

implementation). The key to this approach is that the dynamics of the three-body system

are reduced to the motion on a set of coupled eﬀective potentials that depend only on the

hyperradius R. The hyperradius is a collective coordinate that represents, in some sense, the

3

overall size of the system. The eﬀective potentials are determined by solving the adiabatic

equation

HadΦν(R; Ω) = Uν(R)Φν(R; Ω)

where Ω denotes the ﬁve hyperangles representing all degrees of freedom besides R. The

adiabatic Hamiltonian Had includes the kinetic energy for these hyperangles as well as all

interactions. The eﬀective potentials Uν(R) are then used in the radial equations (atomic

units will be used unless otherwise noted),

where Fν is the hyperradial wave function, E is the total energy, and the three-body reduced
mass µ is related to the atomic mass m by µ = m/√3. The nonadiabatic coupling Wνν′ is re-

sponsible for inelastic transitions such as three-body recombination. The eﬀective potentials

give a very intuitive picture for these complicated systems. Moreover, the calculations can

be made as accurate as desired by including more channels in the equation above (all rates

quoted here are accurate to at least three digits and were obtained with seven channels).

The radial equations (1) are solved using the variational R-matrix method [19] in order to

extract the S-matrix.

The three-body recombination rate K3 is deﬁned in terms of the S-matrix as [7, 16, 17, 18]

where k = √2µE is the hyperradial wave number, and i and f label the initial and ﬁnal

channels, repectively. The present results were obtained using the mass of helium atoms
and the model dimer potential v(r) = Dsech2(r/r0) with D and r0 adjusted to give a single

two-body s-wave bound state.

In the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, recombination for a > 0 is driven primar-

ily by the broadly peaked nonadiabatic coupling between the lowest three-body entrance

channel and the highest molecular channel [7]. In this picture, there are two indistinguish-

able pathways for recombination, leading to the so-called “St¨uckelberg oscillations”. This

interference phenomena modiﬁes the a4 dependence of the rate, suppressing it for certain val-

ues of a. At zero energy, the analytic results predict these minima to be equally spaced on a

logarithmic scale and separated by a factor of approximately eπ/α

22.7, where α = 1.0064.

For a < 0, the recombination rate is enhanced for particular values of a and, with the help

of the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, can be interpreted as three-body tunneling

through a potential barrier in the entrance channel [7]. The nonadiabatic coupling is localized

at small R behind this barrier so that recombination is suppressed for energies below the

barrier maximum. That is, unless the collision energy matches the energy of a three-body

resonance trapped behind this barrier. Under these conditions, transmission through the

barrier jumps and strong enhacement of the recombination rate can be observed. As with

the interference minima, these resonances can be associated with Eﬁmov physics [10], and

are also predict to be equally spaced on a logarithmic scale (separated by a factor of about

22.7). Figure 1 shows the J π = 0+ recombination rates calculated at energies in the range

0.1 nK to 1 mK. Figure 1(a) shows the ﬁrst three resonance peaks for a < 0, and Fig. 1(b)

shows the ﬁrst three interference minima for a > 0. For small values of the scattering

length, the rates for all energies lie along a common, universal curve. For any given energy,

the rates depart from this universal curve at some value of the scattering length, with the

highest energies departing soonest.

In the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, the analytic recombination expression is

derived under the assumption that the collision energy is in the threshold regime.

It is

5

natural, then, to conclude that the analytic expression — and thus the universal behavior

— is only valid in the threshold regime. The collision energy is in the threshold regime when

it is smaller than other characteristic energies of the system. One obvious energy scale is

the two-body binding energy E12.

In Fig. 1, the vertical dashed lines mark the scattering lengths determined from the

relation E <
∼

E12 for each energy. It is clear that the two-body binding energy provides a

reasonable estimate for the domain of universal behavior, i.e., for each energy, the rate curve

for a less than this limit follows the common curve. For a < 0, a better, more restrictive

limit can be determined from the adiabatic potential since the threshold regime in this case

requires energies less than the potential barrier maximum, Umax = 0.079/µa2 [11], which
reduces the limiting a by about a factor of three. For example, in a 23Na condensate at

a temperature of 100 nK, the recombination rate is expected to be universal only for –

3200 a.u.< a < 8650 a.u.; for 87Rb, for –1650 a.u.< a < 4450 a.u. All of these values are

well within the range that are already experimentally accessed near Feshbach resonances.

We also show in Fig. 1 the analytical results [6, 7, 8, 9]:

where Φ and η∗ are unknown parameters. Φ represents an unknown small-R phase [6, 7]

(related to Λ∗ in Refs. [8, 9]) and is chosen to give the best ﬁt to the third interference

minimum at 0.1 nK. The additional 1.63 rad of a < 0 phase is predicted in [9]. The value

η∗=0.1 was found to give the best ﬁt for a < 0. There is generally very good agreement with

the numerical results for large, positive a/r0, and Eq. (3) appears to be essentially exact

for zero energy recombination. It relies on the eﬀective range expansion, however, and gets

increasingly worse as

decreases due to order r0/a errors (here, r0=15 a.u.). The agreement

a
|

|

is more qualitative for a < 0 due to the small shift of the resonance peak positions. We

found, though, that a 15% change in the extra a < 0 phase gives good agreement with the

0.1 nK curve.

One factor left out of Eq. (3) is unitarity (although a “unitarized” version has been

proposed [15] to help explain the experimental results in Ref. [4]). As the collision energy

grows large compared to E12 for a ﬁxed scattering length, the probability of recombination

approaches unity for the 0+ partial wave. More relevant for experiments, unit recombination

6

probability is also reached as the scattering length is increased at ﬁxed collision energy E.

The horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 1 denote the unitarity limit — uN = 192π2/µk4

N , obtained
2=1 — for each energy shown. From the ﬁgure, it is clear that the

recombination rate reaches the unitarity limit for positive a outside the threshold regime.

For negative a, however, while the rate does saturate, it does so at a value about a factor of

ten below unitarity. The main eﬀect of unitarity is to restrict the number of resonances or

minima observable at a given energy.

A second factor neglected in Eq. (3) is the thermal average. Experiments are performed

at ﬁxed temperatures rather than ﬁxed energies, so the thermal average becomes crucial

for proper comparison with experiment. In the threshold regime, the recombination rate is

constant as a function of energy, so the thermal average has no eﬀect. Since we consider

exactly the situation when the system is no longer in the threshold regime, thermal averaging

can have signiﬁcant eﬀects. The thermally averaged recombination rate is

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant. Figure 2 illustrates the eﬀects of thermal averaging at

0.1 µK and 1 µK near the second resonance peak and second interference minima. For

energies solidly within the threshold regime, thermal averaging has little eﬀect. For energies

on the border of the threshold regime, however, averaging reduces the intensity of both the

peaks and minima, making their observation much more diﬃcult.

scattering length for which the 2+ contribution is comparable to 0+. Figure 3 shows the

E2a8 [16], so for a ﬁnite energy, there will be a

thermally averaged 2+ rate at 10 nK and 1 µK along with 0+ for a > 0. (For a < 0, the 2+

recombination rate is many orders of magnitude smaller than for 0+, making it completely

negligible for the present range of scattering lengths and energies.) It is clear from the ﬁgure

that the 2+ rate dominates 0+ at the second interference minimum for 1 µK so that the

total rate will show just one minimum. At 10 nK, the 2+ rate is merely comparable to 0+

at the second minimum, cutting its depth in the total rate. For energies below 10 nK, the

2+ recombination rate is negligible in this range of scattering length; for larger scattering

lengths, however, the 2+ recombination rate can contribute substantially.

evidence for this eﬀect. The present calculations show, however, that the inﬁnite series

are truncated to a small number (

α/π ln(3ac/2r0), where ac = ¯h/√2µ12E12) for typical

experimental parameters and that the contrast of the surviving features may be considerably

reduced. The recombination rate is thus not a good candidate for observing physics related

to the Eﬁmov eﬀect except at extremely low temperatures.

Even though we have shown that the universal behavior described by existing analytic

expressions is limited to the threshold regime, scattering lengths up to a few thousand atomic

units are included. Moreover, a new sort of universal behavior dictated by the unitarity limit

may take over and modiﬁcations to the analytic expressions along these lines have already

been proposed [15]. Since we have used only one model potential, we are not in a position

to discuss any universal behavior outside of the threshold regime. We expect, however, that

recombination for a > 0 will be much as we have shown in Fig. 1 since it takes place at large

distances where diﬀerences in the two-body potential will have little eﬀect. For a < 0, the

situation is just the opposite since recombination is a small distance process. The resonance

positions as well as the a

limiting rate will likely then depend on the two-body

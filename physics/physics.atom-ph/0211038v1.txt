We demonstrate the production of high density cold atom samples (2 × 1014 atoms/cm3) in a
simple optical lattice formed with YAG light that is diﬀracted from a holographic phase plate. A
loading protocol is described that results in 10,000 atoms per lattice site. Rapid free evaporation
leads to phase space densities of 1/150 within 50 msec. The resulting small, high density atomic
clouds are very attractive for a number of experiments, including ultracold Rydberg atom physics.

Conventional light-force atom traps, in particular the
magneto-optical trap (MOT), are limited in density by
radiation trapping to typically 1011 cm−3 [1, 2]. In the
experiments described here, we attain densities in far-oﬀ-
resonance traps (FORTs) that exceed this density by 3
orders of magnitude, and are comparable to BEC den-
sities. We show that FORTs can achieve these densities
in tens of milliseconds, as compared to tens of seconds
for magnetic traps. Such rapidly produced high density
sources are of particular interest for studying novel col-
lision phenomena that do not require the coherence of
BECs and yet can be exploited for quantum manipula-
tion and entanglement of atoms. They are also attrac-
tive for evaporative cooling; several groups have recently
cooled atoms to quantum degeneracy using FORTs [3, 4].
FORTs [5] use spatially varying intensities I(r) to pro-
duce a conservative potential U (r) = −2πα(λ)I(r)/c,
where α(λ) is the polarizability of the atom at the FORT
laser wavelength λ. At a given temperature T and num-
ber of trapped atoms N the peak density depends not
directly on the trap depth but rather on its curvature:
n ∼ N (κ/T )3/2, where κ = −∂2
r U . Therefore much
higher densities can be obtained at roughly the same
trap depth by forming an interference pattern (optical
lattice) to obtain a rapid spatial variation in the inten-
sity. In general, for a ﬁxed laser power and beam area,
forming an interference pattern (lattice) of cell size Λ
from M beams increases the trap depth over a single-
beam FORT by a factor O(M ) and the spring constant
by a factor O(M/Λ2). However, the number of atoms
per lattice site is reduced by O(Λ3) so that the geomet-
rical factors cancel and the density scales as M 3/2. Thus
there is considerable freedom in choosing the geometry
of lattice FORTs without sacriﬁcing density.

For phenomena occurring at high densities (> 1013
cm−3) it is desirable to construct a lattice FORT with
suﬃcient unit cell volume that many atoms can be loaded
into a given lattice site. This has been demonstrated by
several groups using a variety of trap geometries: 3D lat-
tice [6], crossed dipole [3], a single retro-reﬂected beam
[4, 7], a beam focused with an array of microlenses [8],
and the interference of light diﬀracted from a holographic
phase plate [9]. All save the last two require interfero-
metric stability and single-mode lasers. In an early ex-
periment Boiron et al. used a holographic phase plate

tion of the interference pattern formed at the intersection of

and a YAG laser to construct a large Λ Cs lattice. After
applying blue Sisyphus cooling, they obtained densities
of order 1013 cm−3.
In this work we use higher inten-
sities, optimized loading, and evaporation without the
aid of Sisyphus cooling to attain Rb densities exceeding
1014 cm−3 and phase space densities approaching 1/150
after loading for only tens of milliseconds. Furthermore
our use of a multimode ﬂashlamp-pumped laser demon-
strates the robust nature of the trap.

In our experiments we use a YAG laser to acheive an
optical lattice, called a Holographic Atom Trap (HAT),
by interfering ﬁve diﬀracted beams from a holographic
phase plate [10] (Fig. 1). At the intersection of the 5
laser beams an interference pattern

is produced and Rb atoms (α(1.06µm) = 105˚A3[11, 12])
are trapped at the intensity maxima. Here k = 2π/λ,
θ = 0.1 rad is the diﬀraction angle of the four ﬁrst-order
beams, β2 = 0.20 is the ratio of the intensity of a sin-
gle ﬁrst-order diﬀracted beam to that of the zeroth order

beam I0. Along the ˆz propagation direction of the light
the interference arises from the Talbot eﬀect[9]. The re-
sulting lattice sites (microtraps) are 10 µm× 10 µm ×
100 µm in size. With the individual beams focussed to
80 µm and a total power of 8 W the depth of the central
microtrap is 500 µK and the oscillation frequencies are 17
kHz, 17 kHz, and 0.7 kHz. These calculated frequencies
were experimentally conﬁrmed by parametric heating of
the HAT atoms [7]. Since the lasers are nearly coprop-

agating, the potential is quite stable against vibrations
and the YAG laser can have a large bandwidth. Our
multi-longitudinal mode laser has a bandwidth of approx-
imately 25 GHz. Heating due to intensity noise [13] was
easily eliminated with an acousto-optic intensity stabi-
lizer. The relatively large lattice sites allow many atoms
(∼ 104) to be trapped in each site.

Fig. 2 shows a calculated density distribution for atoms
trapped in the HAT at 50 µK temperature. We use a
probe laser propagating along the ˆy-direction to take spa-
tial heterodyne [14] phase images that show the atoms’
isolation within the Talbot fringes and the microtraps
(Fig. 3). We observe Bragg diﬀraction of the probe beam
from the atoms in the microtraps by interference with the
probe beam, also shown in Fig. 3. An interesting obser-
vation from Fig. 2 is that there should be a relative mis-
alignment of the microtraps in successive Talbot fringes.
This is conﬁrmed by the spatial proﬁles shown in Fig. 4.
Analysis of such images gives about 4 × 105 atoms per
Talbot fringe. Time-of-ﬂight temperature measurements
of 50 µK coupled with knowledge of the trapping poten-
tial implies peak densities exceeding 2 × 1014 cm−3 and
phase space densities of 1/150. Typically 25 microtraps
are occupied within each Talbot fringe, with 10% of the
atoms in the central microtrap.

Key to the HAT’s success is an eﬃcient loading proto-
col. We begin with a vapor cell forced dark spot MOT
[15] with 50% of the 107 atoms in each of the hyper-

ﬁne ground states (5S1/2 F=1,2) of 87Rb. The dark spot
is acheived by imaging an opaque object in the hyper-
ﬁne repumping beam (F=1→5P3/2 F′=2). The trapping
light (F=2→F′=3) is tuned 3 linewidths Γ below reso-
nance and has an intensity of 72 mW/cm2. We add a
depumping laser, tuned to the high frequency side of the
F=2→F′=2 resonance, to optically pump more atoms
down to the F=1 ground state. To load the HAT from
the MOT, we compress the cloud by decreasing the trap-
ping light intensity by a factor of 3, then increasing the
MOT magnetic ﬁeld. After 20 msec we turn on the HAT
laser. AC Stark shifts tune the repumping and trapping
beams away from resonance and the depumping beam
towards resonance, causing the atoms in the HAT to be
extremely dark (estimated ∼ 0.001 in F=2 inside the
FORT) [16]. During the HAT loading phase we shift the
trapping laser detuning to −9Γ. The number of trapped
atoms increases until it reaches steady state in about 50
msec, after which the MOT lasers are extinguished. The
MOT to HAT transfer eﬃciency is as high as 15%.

We show in Fig. 5 the temperature and number of
atoms vs time after the loading ceases. The tempera-
ture rapidly decreases to a value of about 50 µK, ap-
proximately 1/10 of the trap depth, as expected for free
evaporation of atoms from the HAT [17]. The evapora-

tion is rapid due to the very high densities; we estimate
the elastic collision rate to exceed 3000/s. Such high col-
lision rates make evaporative cooling very promising for
the HAT and such experiments are underway in our lab-
oratory. Trap lifetime studies show that after the evapo-
ration ceases the temperature stays ﬁxed but the atoms
are slowly ejected from the trap and/or heated [18] by
background gas collisions with a time constant of about
500 msec. For comparison, the MOT lifetime is typically

These high density samples are of potential interest
for a variety of experiments. In addition to obvious ex-
amples such as evaporative cooling and cold collisions,
many groups are interested in ultracold Rydberg atoms.
Excitation of Rydberg states of principal quantum num-
ber ∼100 in our HAT will give rise to strong, long-range
dipole-dipole interactions. Because atoms in our micro-
traps are localized within a 15 µm region, these interac-
tion energies are in excess of 1 MHz for atoms on oppo-
site sides of a microtrap. Consequently, excitation by
a narrow-band laser of more than one Rydberg atom
at a time per microtrap should be greatly suppressed.
This “dipole blockade” is of great interest for applica-
tions in quantum information processing[19] and single
atom and photon sources[20]. Similarly, the densities are
high enough to expect eﬃcient excitation of novel long-
range Rydberg molecules such as those recently proposed
[21, 22]. In addition, it will be interesting to see how the
very much higher densities acheived in the HAT as com-
pared to MOTs aﬀect the production of cold plasmas[23].

The problem of degenerate ground states of open-shell atoms is investigated in spin-restricted and
unrestricted density functional theory using the exact exchange energy functional. For the spin-
unrestricted case, spurious energy splittings of the order of 2 to 3 kcal/mol are found for atoms of
the second and third period which is larger than the splittings obtained from recently proposed ap-
proximate exchange functionals depending explicitly on the current density. In remarkable contrast,
for spin-restricted calculations the degeneracy of different atomic ground states is recovered to within
less than 0.6 kcal/mol.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Hohenberg-Kohn [1] and Kohn-Sham [2] theo-
rems of density functional theory (DFT), which were
originally established for non-degenerate ground states,
may be extended to degenerate ground states as well
[3, 4]. These degenerate ground states lead to a set of dif-
ferent ground state densities and the exact energy func-
tional yields the same ground state energy for all these
densities. It has long been known, however, that com-
mon approximations do not yield the same total ener-
gies [5, 6, 7, 8].
In a systematic investigation of this
problem Baerends and coworkers [9] showed that for
states with different total magnetic quantum number,
ML, spurious energy splittings of up to 5 kcal/mol re-
sult from generalized gradient approximations (GGA’s).
Even larger ones are observed for the meta-GGA’s [10].
The problem has attracted renewed interest recently.
Becke has proposed an approach for constructing ex-
change-correlation functionals with an increased abil-
ity to reproduce the degeneracy of atomic states [11].
The essential idea is to enforce the proper description
of the Fermi (or exchange) hole curvature [12] in the
approximation of the exchange-correlation energy func-
tional [13]. As a consequence, the paramagnetic current
density appears explicitly in the expression of the corre-
sponding functional [14]. This improves the description
of the atomic degeneracy [11] of states carrying different
paramagnetic current densities.

Along the line of Becke’s approach, Maximoff et al
[15] have modiﬁed the GGA of Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof (PBE) to a form explicitly dependening on the
current density. In this way they successfully reduced
the previous spurious energy splittings. Actually, they
have weakened Becke’s suggestion by improving not
the exchange hole curvature at all points in space, but
rather its average.

More recently, Tao and Perdew [10] have employed
ideas of the current-DFT framework of Vignale and Ra-
solt [16]. They constructed a current-dependent correc-
tion to GGA and meta-GGA functionals and their results
again suggest that some improvements for the energy
splittings can be achieved.

In this work we test the performance of the exact ex-
change energy functional using the Optimized Effective

Potential method [17, 18] for the problem of degener-
ate ground states. In particular, we analyze an interest-
ing aspect of the degeneracy problem related to the ad-
ditional degrees of freedom introduced by going from
the original DFT formulation of Hohenberg, Kohn and
Sham to the spin-DFT (SDFT) formalism of von Barth
and Hedin [19]. As a consequence of this additional
variational freedom, lower total energies are obtained in
SDFT than in corresponding spin-restricted (DFT) calcu-
lations. At the same time, however, the spurious energy
splittings are increased for the states of different ML.
In this work we only consider densities represented by
single Slater determinants of Kohn-Sham orbitals. The
general formalism to deal with densities which can only
be described as weighted sum of several determinantal
densities is discussed in Refs. [20, 21].

In the following we recall the basic ideas of the Opti-
mized Effective Potential method and brieﬂy compare
the resulting equations in the DFT and SDFT frame-
work. We then give some details on our numerical im-
plementation along with the resulting energy splittings
for the exact-exchange functional. Our ﬁndings are com-
pared with results from other approximations discussed
in the literature before we draw our conclusions.

II. SPIN RESTRICTED AND UNRESTRICTED
KOHN-SHAM SCHEMES

In this Section we brieﬂy review the basic equations of
spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted density functional
theory. We then focus on orbital-dependent approxi-
mations to the exchange-correlation energy functional
and discuss, for a given orbital functional, the relation
between the corresponding exchange-correlation poten-
tials in the restricted (DFT) and the unrestricted (SDFT)
formalisms.

In the unrestricted SDFT formalism, the total energy
E of a system of interacting electrons is a functional of
the two spin densities ρσ(r) (σ =↑, ↓):

E[ρ↑, ρ↓] = Ts[ρ↑, ρ↓]

d3r v0(r)ρ(r) + U [ρ] + Exc[ρ↑, ρ↓]

is the non-interacting kinetic energy and Nσ is the num-
ber of electrons with spin σ. v0(r) is an external, electro-
static potential and

ρ(r) = ρ↑(r) + ρ↓(r)

is the total electronic density. The classical electrostatic
(Hartree) interaction energy is given by

U [ρ] =

and Exc is the exchange-correlation energy functional
which has to be approximated in practice. The single-
particle orbitals ϕjσ(r) in Eq. (2) are solutions of the
Kohn-Sham equation [19]

where j is a collective index for the one-electron quan-
tum numbers except spin. The effective single particle
potential for spin σ is given by

vsσ(r) = v0(r) + vH (r) + vxcσ(r)

with the Hartree potential

vH (r) =

3r′ ρ(r′)

vxcσ(r) =

.

The self-consistency cycle is closed by computing the
spin densities via

ρσ(r) =

|ϕjσ(r)|2

Nσ

Xj=1

where the sum runs over the occupied orbitals.

The unrestricted Kohn-Sham scheme of SDFT imme-
diately reduces to the restricted scheme of DFT if one
considers exchange-correlation functionals which only
depend on the total electronic density of Eq. (3) as en-
visioned in the original Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [1].
Then the exchange-correlation potential is

and

and both vxc and the total effective potential vs are in-
dependent of the spin index σ. Note that in spinte of
the spin-independence of vs and vxc, the Kohn-Sham
orbitals, being proper fermionic single-particle orbitals,
still carry a spin-dependence.

Of course, the exchange-correlation energy functional
needs to be approximated in practice. Popular approxi-
mations like the local density approximation (LDA) or
generalized gradient approximations (GGA’s) use an
approximate form of Exc which explicitly depends on
the density (in DFT) or on the spin-densities (in SDFT),
i.e., different forms of the functional are required in DFT
and SDFT. However, if one considers functionals which
explicitly depend on the single-particle orbitals rather
than the (spin-)density, one and the same orbital func-
tional may be used either in the DFT or in the SDFT
framework. The difference is the implicit dependence
of the Kohn-Sham orbitals on the corresponding basic
variables: in DFT they are implicit functionals of the to-
tal particle density only, while in SDFT the orbitals are
implicit functionals of the spin densities.

For orbital functionals,

the calculation of the ex-
change-correlation potential is somewhat more com-
plicated than for explicit density functionals and is
achieved with the so-called Optimized Effective Poten-
tial Method (OEP) [17, 18]. For a review of the method
the reader is referred to Ref. [22]. The OEP method leads
to an integral equation for the exchange-correlation po-
tential. For simplicity, we consider approximations of
Exc that are functionals of the occupied orbitals only.
The OEP integral equation can then be written in com-
pact notation (in SDFT)

ogy to Eq. (12) with vxcσ being replaced by vxc. Apply-

(19)

where ˜vxcjσ is deﬁned as ¯vxcjσ in Eq. (16) except that
vxcσ is again replaced by vxc. The DFT exchange-
correlation potential (19) can be written as a weighted
average of potentials for the different spin channels

vxc(r) =

ρ↑(r)˜vxc↑(r) + ρ↓(r)˜vxc↓(r)

(20)

where

|ϕjσ(r)|2 (uxcjσ(r) + (˜vxcjσ − ¯uxcjσ))

Eqs. (11) or (19) can be solved iteratively along
with the corresponding Kohn-Sham equations in a self-
consistent fashion. Due to the presence of the unoccu-
pied Kohn-Sham orbitals in the deﬁnition of the orbital
shifts (see Eqs. (12) and (13)), the full numerical solution
of the OEP integral equation is nontrivial. In the origi-
nal paper [18], solutions were presented for atomic sys-
tems with spherical symmetry. Much later, it has also
been solved for systems with lower symmetry such as
molecules [24, 25] and solids [26]. Recently, an itera-
tive algorithm for the solution of the OEP integral equa-
tion based on the orbital shifts has been implemented
[27, 28].

In what follows we do not attempt a solution of the
full OEP equation but rather use an approximation sug-
gested by Krieger, Li and Iafrate [29] which has been
found to be rather accurate in many situations. In this
so-called KLI approximation, the terms containing the
orbital shifts on the r.h.s. of Eqs. (11) or (19) are ne-
glected completely. The KLI approximation may be sub-
stituted by a slightly more elaborate one known as Com-
mon Energy Denominator Approximation (CEDA) [30]
or Localized Hartree-Fock (LHF) approximation [31].
However, it has been found that CEDA and KLI total
energies are extremely close for atoms [32]. Moreover,
for the atoms studied in this work we expect that KLI
and CEDA results are very similar also for the current-
carrying states since in most cases (from boron to mag-
nesium) the current-carrying orbitals enter the expres-
sions for the KLI and CEDA potentials in exactly the
same way.

The OEP equations given above are valid for any form
of the exchange-correlation functional Exc which de-
pends on the occupied orbitals only.
In this work we
use the exact exchange functional

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this Section we present our numerical results on the
degeneracy problem of open-shell atomic ground states.

3

It is well-known that standard approximations like LDA
or GGA do not give the same, degenerate ground state
energies for different open-shell conﬁgurations. This is
due to the fact that the densities of these ground states
are different, leading to different Kohn-Sham potentials
derived from these densities and therefore also to dif-
ferent total energies [9]. Recently, this problem has at-
tracted renewed interest [10, 11, 15] where approximate
functionals depending on the current-density have been
suggested which, while not solving the problem com-
pletely, at least reduce the energy splittings between dif-
ferent conﬁgurations signiﬁcantly. Here we investigate
the problem at the exact-exchange level, both in DFT
and SDFT.

Although the (interacting) Hamiltonian of an atom
has spherical symmetry, the ground state densities of
open-shell atoms typically are not spherical. However,
for any of the possible degenerate ground states one can
always ﬁnd an axis for which the corresponding density
exhibits cylindrical symmetry and we choose this axis
as the z-axis of our coordinate system. We seek a Kohn-
Sham single-particle potential with the same cylindrical
symmetry. Then the magnetic quantum number m is a
good quantum number to characterize the Kohn-Sham
orbitals. We can then perform self-consistent calcula-
tions by specifying how many orbitals with m = 0, 1, . . .
be occupied for each spin channel and then keep this
conﬁguration ﬁxed throughout the self-consistency cy-
cle. For example, for the boron atom, one conﬁguration
has all spin-up electrons and the two spin-down elec-
trons in m = 0 states while in another conﬁguration one
of the spin-up electrons is required to occupy an m = 1
state with the other occupations unchanged. In this way
current-carrying and zero-current states can be consid-
ered.

We have developed an atomic code for DFT and
SDFT calculations in a basis set representation, assum-
ing cylindrical symmetry of the Kohn-Sham potential.
As basis functions we use Slater-type basis functions for
the radial part multiplied with spherical harmonics for
the angular part. We use the quadruple zeta basis sets
(QZ4P) of Ref. [33] for the Slater functions.

We have tested our code by computing the total en-
ergies of spherically symmetric atoms of the ﬁrst and
second row of the periodic table in exchange-only KLI
approximation and compared with results from accu-
rate, fully numerical codes available in the literature
[22, 29, 34]. Our code reproduces these energies to
within a maximum deviation of 0.3 Kcal/mol and an av-
erage deviation of 0.1 Kcal/mol for the ﬁrst-row atoms
and to within a maximum deviation of 0.9 Kcal/mol and
an average deviation of 0.5 Kcal/mol for the second row.
As a more relevant estimate of the accuracy of our cal-
culations we have also computed the energy splittings
between different conﬁgurations in LSD. Our results re-
produce those reported in Ref. [11] with a deviation of
less than 0.02 kcal/mol.

We then calculated self-consistent total energies for

the different conﬁgurations of open-shell atoms. Table
I shows the energy differences (spurious energy split-
tings) between Kohn-Sham Slater determinants with to-
tal magnetic quantum number |ML| = 1 and ML = 0
in kcal/mol of our exchange-only KLI calculations of
DFT and SDFT. For comparison we also list the re-
sults of the current-dependent exchange-only function-
als of Refs. [11] (denoted jBR) and [15] (denoted jPBE)
in the ﬁrst and second column, respectively. As can be
seen, our SDFT results for the exact-exchange functional
lead to larger splittings than both the jBR and the jPBE
functionals. The idea behind the construction of these
functionals is to improve the exchange-hole curvature
by inclusion of the orbital paramagnetic current den-
sity. Since in our calculations we have used the exact
exchange functional (and therefore also the correct ex-
change hole curvature) the success of the jBR and jPBE
functionals in reducing the energy splittings might actu-
ally be due to an overcorrection of their parent function-
als.

The most remarkable results of our calculations are
the energy splittings obtained with a pure DFT (i.e.,
spin-restricted) calculation using the exact exchange
functional (last column of Table I). These spurious split-
tings are in most cases more than an order of magnitude
smaller than the corresponding SDFT results, therefore
basically reproducing the exact degeneracy of the differ-
ent ground-state conﬁgurations. Of course, due to the
additional variational degree of freedom, total energies
in SDFT are always lower than corresponding DFT re-
sults. The price to be paid for this improvement, how-
ever, are the unphysically increased energy splittings.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have calculated the spurious energy
splittings between atomic states of different quantum

4

number ML using the exact-exchange functional. We
have employed the KLI approximation to compute the
Kohn-Sham exchange potential and found that for spin-
unrestricted calculations the splittings are between 1
and 3 kcal/mol for the atoms of the second and third
period. Somewhat surprisingly, these are larger than
the splittings reported with approximate exchange func-
tionals which include the paramagnetic current density
as an input parameter [11, 15].

However, if the exact exchange functional is used in a
spin-restricted DFT calculation, the spurious energy split-
tings are reduced signiﬁcantly, the largest one being of
the order of 0.5 kcal/mol. One might speculate that the

remaining splittings are due to the KLI approximation
and could be further reduced if the full OEP equations
for the exchange potential are solved.

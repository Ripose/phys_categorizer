Abstract.

General recurrence relations for arbitrary non-diagonal, radial hydrogenic ma-
trix elements are derived in Dirac relativistic quantum mechanics. Our approach
is based on a generalization of the second hypervirial method previously employed
in the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger case. A relativistic version of the Pasternack-
Sternheimer relation is thence obtained in the diagonal (i.e. total angular momentum
and parity the same) case, from such relation an expression for the relativistic virial
theorem is deduced. To contribute to the utility of the relations, explicit expressions
for the radial matrix elements of functions of the form rλ and βrλ —where β is a
Dirac matrix— are presented.

Keywords: Relativistic hydrogen atom, recurrence relations, non-diagonal radial ma-
trix elements, relativistic Pasternack-Sternheimer relation.

I. Introduction

Recurrence relations for matrix elements are very useful tools in quantum calcu-
lations [1–5] since the direct computation of such elements is generally very cumber-
some. An interesting example is the Blanchard’s relation which is a useful recurrence
formula for arbitrary (i.e. not necessarily diagonal) non-relativistic matrix elements

energy eigenstates; according to this relation, once any three successive matrix ele-
ments of powers of the radial coordinate, r, are known, any other can be deduced in
terms of the previously known ones. The Blanchard recurrence relation was derived
more than twenty ﬁve years ago using a calculation-intensive method [6], which is
not surprising since in general recurrence relations are rather diﬃcult to obtain.

Trying to overcome such diﬃculties, diﬀerent approaches have been proposed for
obtaining general recurrence relations; some of them are based on algebraic methods,
others use sum rules and hypervirial theorems [4,7–10]. In particular, a hypervirial
result has been employed to obtain the Blanchard relation in a more compact way
than in the original deduction [11]. In relativistic quantum mechanics, on the other
hand, and despite its physical and its possible chemical interest [7,8,12,13], excepting
for the results reported in [14], there are not as yet general recurrence relations which
could be used for calculating matrix elements of powers of the radial coordinate in
terms of previously known ones. We should mention though that there are previous
eﬀorts in such direction, in which closed forms for certain relativistic matrix elements
have been evaluated [16,17] and certain, mostly diagonal, recurrence relations for
relativistic and quasirelativistic states have been calculated [3,9,12,17] .

×

In this paper we employ a relativistic calculation inspired on the hypervirial
method [11] to deduce a recurrence relation for the, in general, non-diagonal radial
matrix elements of succesive powers of rλ and of βrλ—where β is a 4
4 Dirac matrix
[18–20]— for relativistic hydrogenic states in the energy basis. The assumptions we
use are that the nucleus is point-like and ﬁxed in space, and that a description
using the Dirac equation is valid. We ﬁrst study the recurrence relations in the
general case, in which the matrix elements are taken between states with diﬀerent
principal quantum numbers n1 6
= n2,, diﬀerent total angular momentum quantum
1)j+l−1/2
= mj2, and, as we use the quantum number ǫ
numbers j1 6
= j2, mj1 6
≡
= ǫ2. We ﬁnd
instead of parity for labelling the hydrogenic eigenstates, where ǫ1 6
that in general the recurrence relations depend on matrix elements of both powers
of r and of βr. In practical terms this means that we need two recurrence relations
as the relativistic version of the single-equation Blanchard relation [Eqs. (6) and (7)
of section II]. Given its special interest, we study in particular the case where the
total angular momentum and parity become equal, j1 = j2 and ǫ1 = ǫ2, in the two
states—not mattering the relative values of the principal quantum number n. We

(

also address the completely diagonal case where n1 = n2, j1 = j2, and ǫ1 = ǫ2.
Both of the particular cases mentioned above require special treatment for avoiding
possible divisions by zero in the general expressions; such results are immediately
used to obtain a relativistic version of the Pasternack-Sternheimer rule [21] and to
obtain an expression for the relativistic virial theorem [9,14,22].

This paper is organized as follows. In section II we review the second hypervirial
scheme used for deriving the non-relativistic Blanchard relation. In section III, after
obtaining the radial Hamiltonian useful for implementing the hypervirial result in
relativistic quantum mechanics, we proceed to use it to deduce by a long but direct
calculation the relativistic recurrence formulae. In section IV we study in particular
the diagonal case (j2 = j1, ǫ2 = ǫ1) to derive the relativistic Pasternak-Sternheimer
rule and use it (when n1 = n2) to obtain a version of the relativistic virial theorem.
In the Appendix, we obtain explicit expressions for diagonal and non-diagonal matrix
elements for any power of r and of βr between radial relativistic hydrogenic states.
As it becomes evident, such results are rather cumbersome for relatively large values
of the power; for small values, on the other hand, they are better regarded as starting
values for the recurrence relations derived in section III of this article. Furthermore,
these results can be of utility not only for relativistic atomic and molecular studies
but also for evaluating matrix elements of interactions designed to test Lorentz and
CPT invariance in hydrogen [14,29].

II. The non-relativistic recurrence relation

Both the Blanchard relation and its predecesor the Kramers selection rule, were
originally obtained employing directly the Schr¨odinger equation together with ap-
propriate boundary conditions and, at least in the former case, a great deal of com-
putations [1,6]. A much simpler approach based on a generalized hypervirial result
and certain Hamiltonian identities has been developed to simplify the computations
leading to the Blanchard relation [11]. This technique seemed to us an appropriate
starting point for deriving relativistic recurrence formulae. It is with such relativis-
tic extension in mind that we review in this section the hypervirial method as it
is applied in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In this section, as in most of the
paper, we employ atomic units ¯h = m = e = 1.

The idea is to start with the radial Schr¨odinger equation for a central potential

V (r) written in the form

where

energy eigenvalue with principal and angular momentum quantum numbers, nk and
lk, respectively; k is just a label, and Hk, the non-relativistic radial Hamiltonian, is
given by

Although we want to calculate the radial matrix elements of terms of the form
rλ, it is best for our purposes to consider ﬁrst matrix elements of an arbitrary radial
function f (r). With such choice we can readily show [11] that

relativistic quantum virial theorem [9]

III. The relativistic recurrence relations.

In this section we apply the method sketched in section II to the relativistic
Dirac case. We clearly need to start with a radial Dirac Hamiltonian analogous to
(2). To obtain such Hamiltonian we start with the Dirac Hamiltonian HD and the
corresponding time-independent Dirac equation for a central potential

notice that, despite the selection of natural units we shall, where it aids interpreta-
tion, reinsert the appropriate dimensional factors in certain equations. The energy

rotationally invariant, hence the solutions of the Dirac equation (10) can be written
in the alternative but entirely equivalent forms [19,23]

from this equation we see that when L2 is applied to any central potential state, the
big component of the state function behaves with the orbital quantum number l =

Though this explicit representation can be used for our problem [24,25], it is not
really necessary since all our results are representation independent.

The relativistic recurrence relation we are after, can be deduced using a similar
reasoning as the used in section II for the non-relativistic case. Let us ﬁrst calculate
the non-diagonal matrix element of an arbitrary radial function f (r)

but here, due to the presence of Dirac matrices in the result, we cannot use the trick

to simplify the calculation [11]. Instead, let us calculate the following second order

Equations (23–33) are the basic equations of our problem. To proceed, we
consider, as in the non-relativistic case, radial functions of the form f (r) = rλ and
insert the explicit expression for the Coulomb potential: V (r) =
Z/r. Let us
mention though that our results can be generalized to other power of potentials,
such as the Lennard-Jones potentials [26].

As we may have expected, we need to know six matrix coeﬃcients instead of

function, doubling in this sense the “degrees of freedom” of the system.

It does not seems to be possible to avoid the β-dependency in Eq. (44), and thus,
in
taken on its own, Eq. (41) does not allow the computation of
terms of the

This expression could be considered as a relativistic generalization of the Pasternak-
Sternheimer rule of non relativistic quantum mechanics (Equation (8) of section II)
[21], which says that the expectation value between hydrogenic states of the 1/r2
potential, vanishes when the orbital angular momenta of the states 1 and 2 coincide,
i.e. when l1 = l2. In the relativistic case the expectation value of the β/r potential
(which could be regarded as the square root of 1/r2 including both signs), does not
necessarily vanish even when the total angular momenta of the two states coincide:
i.e. it does not vanish when j1 = j2. Again, this agrees with the fact that the non-
relativistic Pasternack-Sternheimer rule is applicable to eigenfunctions of potentials
whose energy eigenvalues depend only on the principal quantum number—which is
not the case for the hydrogen atom in Dirac relativistic quantum mechanics [14].

Moreover, two special cases are immediately deduced from this last expression

(56):
1) The ﬁrst case, when n1 6

V. The values of < rλ > and < βrλ >.

The recurrence relations found above, involve in principle simple expressions
(since they involve only matrix elements of Dirac hydrogenic states) that can be
burdensome to handle. Given such situation, we have also calculated explicit formu-
las that are needed to evaluate the diagonal and the non-diagonal matrix elements
of interest. The expressions are related to the hypergeometric function and can be
deduced from the two diﬀerential equations that follow from the Hamiltonian (20),

Appendix. Explicit expressions for relativistic matrix elements of rλ and
βrλ

It is possible to obtain explicit expressions for the diagonal and non diagonal
matrix elements in the case V (r) =
Z/r. The purpose of this appendix is to give the
basic relation that is needed for such evaluation. As we heavily draw from results
previously obtained, in this section we use the notation of Ref. 23, in particular
¯h = c = e = 1, though we sometimes write all the dimensional constants.

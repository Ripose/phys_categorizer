A search for sidereal variations in the frequency diﬀerence between co-located 129Xe and 3He
Zeeman masers sets the most stringent limit to date on leading-order Lorentz and CPT violation
involving the neutron, consistent with no eﬀect at the level of 10−31 GeV.

Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental feature of modern
descriptions of nature, including both the standard model
of particle physics and general relativity. However, these
realistic theories are believed to be the low-energy limit
of a single fundamental theory at the Planck scale. Even
if the underlying theory is Lorentz invariant, spontaneous
symmetry breaking might result in small apparent vio-
lations of Lorentz invariance at an observable level. Ex-
perimental investigations of the validity of Lorentz sym-
metry therefore provide valuable tests of the framework
of modern theoretical physics.

Clock-comparison experiments [1–6] serve as sensitive
probes of rotation invariance and hence of Lorentz sym-
metry, essentially by bounding the frequency variation of
a clock as its orientation changes. In practice, the most
precise limits are obtained by comparing the frequencies
of two diﬀerent co-located clocks as they rotate with the
Earth. Typically, the clocks are electromagnetic signals
emitted or absorbed on hyperﬁne or Zeeman transitions.
Here, we report on a search for sidereal variations in
the frequency of co-located 129Xe and 3He masers, both
operating on nuclear spin-1/2 Zeeman transitions. In the
context of a general standard-model extension allowing
for the possibility of Lorentz and CPT violation [7,8],
the 129Xe/3He-maser experiment sets the most stringent
limit to date on leading order Lorentz and CPT violation
of the neutron: about 10−31 GeV, or more than six times
better than the best previous measurements [9].

The standard-model extension motivating this experi-
ment emerges from any underlying theory that generates
the standard model and contains spontaneous Lorentz vi-
olation [10]. For example, this might occur in string the-
ory [11]. The standard-model extension maintains theo-
retically desirable properties of the usual standard model
[8]. Its formulation at the level of the known elementary
particles is a key feature enabling quantitative compari-
son of a wide array of tests of Lorentz and CPT symme-
try. In this context, theoretical studies have been per-
formed to investigate the sensitivity of clock-comparison
experiments [9], tests of QED in Penning traps [12], ex-
periments with a spin-polarized torsion pendulum [13],
hydrogen-antihydrogen spectroscopy [14], studies of pho-
ton birefringence in the vacuum [15,8,16], observations of

muons [17], measurements of neutral-meson oscillations
[7,18], studies of the baryon asymmetry [19], and obser-
vations of cosmic rays [20].

In the context of the standard-model extension, the
most sensitive prior clock-comparison experiment is the
199Hg/133Cs comparison of Hunter, Lamoreaux et al.
[6,9].
Recent experimental work motivated by the
standard-model extension includes Penning trap tests by
Gabrielse et al. on the antiproton and the H− ion [21]
and by Dehmelt et al.
on the electron and positron
[22,23]. A reanalysis by Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel,
and co-workers of existing data from a spin-polarized tor-
sion pendulum experiment [24,25] sets the most strin-
gent bound to date on Lorentz and CPT violation of the
electron, at about 10−28 GeV [26]. A recent Lorentz-
symmetry test using hydrogen masers has searched for
Zeeman-frequency sidereal variations, placing a bound
on Lorentz violation at the level of 10−27 GeV [27]. To-
gether with the results of Ref. [26], this implies an im-
proved clean limit of 10−27 GeV on Lorentz-violating cou-
plings involving the proton. Also, the KTeV experiment
at Fermilab and the OPAL and DELPHI collaborations
at CERN have constrained possible Lorentz- and CPT-
violating eﬀects in the K and Bd systems [28,29].

The standard-model extension predicts

the
leading-order Lorentz- and CPT-violating correction to
the 3He-maser frequency, using the 129Xe maser as a co-
magnetometer, is [9]:

Here, ˜bn
J are small parameters characterizing
the strength of Lorentz-violating couplings of the neu-
tron to possible background tensor ﬁelds that may arise
from spontaneous symmetry breaking in a fundamental
theory. The couplings associated with ˜bn
J also vi-
olate CPT. All three parameters are linear combinations
of more basic quantities in the underlying relativistic La-
grangian of the standard-model extension [9].

J and ˜gn

In the analysis leading to Eq. (1), the Lorentz-violating
coupling of either the 3He or 129Xe nucleus has been
taken as that of a single 1S1/2 valence neutron in a
Schmidt model [9]. The parameters appearing in Eq.

J , ˜gn

J , ˜dn

(1) are therefore associated only with neutron couplings,
as indicated by the superscript n on ˜bn
J . Equation
(1) also assumes that the applied magnetic ﬁeld, which
sets the quantization axis of the experiment, is directed
east-west in the Earth’s reference frame. The subscript
J = X, Y indicates components in the sidereal reference
frame that are orthogonal to the Earth’s axis of rotation.
The design and operation of the two-species 129Xe/3He
maser has been discussed in recent publications [30,31].
Here, we give a brief review. The two-species maser con-
tains dense co-located ensembles of 3He and 129Xe atoms.
Each ensemble performs an active maser oscillation on
its nuclear spin-1/2 Zeeman transition at approximately
4.9 kHz for 3He and 1.7 kHz for 129Xe in a static mag-
netic ﬁeld of 1.5 gauss. This two-species maser operation
can be maintained indeﬁnitely. The population inver-
sions for the two maser ensembles are created by spin-
exchange collisions between the noble-gas atoms and op-
tically pumped Rb vapor [32,33]. The 129Xe/3He maser
has two glass chambers, one acting as the spin exchange
“pump bulb” and the other serving as the “maser bulb.”
This two chamber conﬁguration permits the combination
of physical conditions necessary for a high ﬂux of spin-
polarized noble gas atoms into the maser bulb, while also
maintaining 3He- and 129Xe-maser oscillations with good
frequency stability: stability of about 100 nHz is typical
for measurement intervals larger than about an hour [31].
Either noble-gas species can serve as a precision magne-
tometer to stabilize the system’s static magnetic ﬁeld,
while the other species is employed as a sensitive probe
for Lorentz- and CPT-violating interactions.

We used the 129Xe/3He maser to search for a Lorentz-
violation signature by monitoring the relative phases
and Larmor frequencies of the co-located 3He and 129Xe
masers as the laboratory reference frame rotated with re-
spect to the ﬁxed stars. The system was operated with
the 129Xe maser as the co-magnetometer, the 3He maser
free-running, and the quantization axis directed east-
west in the Earth’s reference frame. To leading order,
the standard-model extension predicts that the Lorentz-
violating frequency shifts for the 3He and 129Xe maser
are the same size and sign. Hence, the resultant side-
real variation of the 3He maser frequency observed in the
laboratory frame takes the form

δνHe = δνX cos(Ωst) + δνY sin(Ωst),

(2)

where Ωs is the angular frequency of the sidereal day [34],
and the parameters δνJ given by Eq. (1) represent the
net eﬀect of the Lorentz- and CPT-violating couplings
on the 3He maser frequency with the 129Xe maser act-
ing as a co-magnetometer. The time t was measured in
seconds from the beginning of the sidereal day in Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts (longitude −71.11◦).

Data collection and analysis were performed as fol-
lows. The 129Xe- and 3He-maser signals from an induc-
tive pickup coil were buﬀered, ampliﬁed, and sent to a

2

pair of digital lock-in detectors. Typical raw-signal lev-
els were about 3 to 5 µV. All reference signals used in
the experiment were derived from the same hydrogen-
maser clock, thus eliminating concerns about unmeasur-
able electronic phase shifts between the reference oscil-
lators. The hydrogen maser operated on the standard
hyperﬁne clock transition, and thus had no leading-order
sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation [9,14]. Active
feedback to the solenoid’s magnetic ﬁeld locked the phase
of the 129Xe maser to that of a 1.7 kHz reference signal,
and thereby isolated the experiment from common-mode
systematic eﬀects (such as stray magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctua-
tions) that would otherwise shift the frequencies of the
noble-gas masers in proportion to the ratio of their mag-
netic moments. When phase locked, the short- and long-
term frequency stability [31] of the 129Xe maser was sev-
eral orders of magnitude better than that of the free-
running 3He maser, so the 129Xe Zeeman frequency was
treated as constant in the data analysis.

The phase and amplitude of both maser signals were
recorded at four-second intervals by the lock-in ampli-
ﬁers and downloaded for analysis every 23.93 hours.
A one-sidereal day run thus contained approximately
21,540 evenly spaced measurements of the relative phases
of the two masers. The values of the two coeﬃcients
δνX , δνY were computed, providing a measure of poten-
tial Lorentz-violation for that day’s run. Seven additional
diagnostic signals were recorded, including the temper-
atures of the pump bulb, maser bulb, and external res-
onator; an optical monitor of the Rb magnetization in the
pump bulb; the broadband power emitted by the optical-
pumping laser-diode array; the ambient room tempera-
ture; and the east-west component of the ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld. Control loops stabilized the system tempera-
tures to about 10 mK. Two additional control loops were
used, feeding back to the optical-pumping laser to reduce
systematic eﬀects arising from variations in the density
and polarization of Rb in the pump bulb [35].

Small noble-gas polarization-induced frequency shifts
were the dominant source of instability (i.e., phase drift)
in the free-running 3He maser. For a typical one-day
run, the linear-correlation coeﬃcient between 3He phase
data and the integrated amplitude of either maser was in
the range 0.95 - 0.99. We admitted terms to our data-
analysis model to account for this polarization-induced
phase drift. The eﬀect of potential Lorentz-violating cou-
plings on the evolution of the 3He phase was expressed
in terms of the coeﬃcients δνJ via integration of Eq. (2),
and initial reduction of each one-day run was performed
using the minimal ﬁt model

δφHe = φ0 + 2πν0t

+2πΩ−1

s [δνX sin(Ωst) − δνY cos(Ωst)],

(3)

where the coeﬃcients φ0 and ν0 account for absolute
phase and frequency oﬀsets between the 3He maser and

the ultra-stable reference oscillator. The reduced χ2
statistic for this ﬁt model was determined, and then
additional terms corresponding to quadratic and maser
amplitude-correlated phase drift were incorporated into
the model if they signiﬁcantly improved the reduced χ2
[36]. The coeﬃcients δνX and δνY for each one-day run
were extracted using a linear least-squares routine on the
best-ﬁtting model for that day, which contained at most
seven free parameters and thus at least (21500 − 7) de-
grees of freedom. See Fig. 1 for an example of the residu-
als from one day’s data. As a ﬁnal check, a faux Lorentz-
violating eﬀect of known phase and amplitude was added
to the raw data and the analysis was repeated. Data re-
duction for a given sidereal day was considered successful
if the synthetic physics was recovered and there was no
change in the covariance matrix generated by the ﬁtting
routine.

FIG. 1. Typical residuals for the 3He phase data from one
sidereal day, calculated using the ﬁt model given in Eq. (3).

Data for this experiment were acquired with three dif-
ferent maser cells over a period of 30 days in April 1999
(cell S3), 24 days in September 1999 (cell E9), and 60
days in February-May 2000 (cell SE3, runs 1 and 2). A
total of 90 usable sidereal-day values of δνX , δνY were
obtained. The main magnetic ﬁeld of the apparatus was
reversed about every 10 days to help distinguish possible
Lorentz-violating eﬀects from diurnal systematic varia-
tions. Field reversal and subsequent re-equilibration of
the masers required approximately 24 hours.

Systematic eﬀects resulting from possible diurnally
varying ambient magnetic ﬁelds would not average away
with ﬁeld reversals. Thus, the eﬀectiveness of the 129Xe
co-magnetometer at eliminating such eﬀects was care-
fully assessed before beginning data acquisition. Since
the two maser ensembles do not have perfect spatial
overlap, penetration of external magnetic ﬁelds through
the nested magnetic shields and into the interaction re-
gion could induce small frequency shifts in the free-
running 3He maser despite the presence of the 129Xe co-
magnetometer. Large coils (∼ 2.4 m diameter) surround-
ing the 129Xe/3He-maser apparatus were used to switch
on and oﬀ 0.5 G external magnetic ﬁelds in the north-

3

south and east-west directions. A bound on the ratio
|δνHe/δBexternal| was obtained. The drifts in the ambi-
ent magnetic ﬁeld near the apparatus were measured to
be about 0.2 mG over a typical 24-hour period, result-
ing in a worst-case shift on the free-running 3He maser
of less than 8 nHz, well below the present sensitivity of
the experiment to Lorentz and CPT violation. It should
be noted that the relative phase between the solar and
sidereal day evolved about 2π radians over the course of
the experiment (April 1999 to May 2000). Hence, diur-
nal systematic eﬀects from any source would tend to be
reduced by averaging results from all measurement sets.
The measured values of δνJ exhibited a small depen-
dence on the direction of the solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld in
the laboratory frame. This dependence was most likely
due to hysteresis and asymmetry in magnetic interactions
between the solenoid and the nested µ-metal shields un-
der ﬁeld reversal. For each cell, the data for the east
and west magnetic-ﬁeld orientations were analyzed sepa-
rately to determine mean values and standard errors for
δνJ , yielding the results in Table 1. As an example, Fig.
2 shows the single-day values of δνX obtained in the ﬁrst
run with cell SE3 in the east ﬁeld orientation (SE3 E1).

the 129Xe/3He-maser experiment is most sensitive to the

above experimental result for R corresponds to a value for

Y )2 = (4.0±3.3)×10−31 GeV. This re-
sult is consistent with no Lorentz- and CPT-violating ef-
fect, given reasonable assumptions about the probability
distribution for R [37]. It represents the most stringent
limit to date on possible Lorentz- and CPT-violating cou-
plings involving the neutron and is more than six times
better than the best previous measurements [9].

We are planning improved Lorentz and CPT tests us-
ing noble-gas masers. Upgrading laser and temperature
control and acquiring a larger data set could better the
present Lorentz and CPT constraint from the 129Xe/3He
system by up to an order of magnitude. Also, a new two-
species Zeeman maser using 3He and 21Ne might provide
even greater improvements to constraints on neutron pa-
rameters [9,38].

David Phillips, Mark Rosenberry, Federico Can´e, Tim-
othy Chupp, Robert Vessot and Edward Mattison helped
greatly with this project. Development of the 129Xe/3He
Zeeman maser was supported by a NIST Precision Mea-
surement Grant.
Support for the Lorentz-violation
test was provided by NASA grant NAG8-1434, ONR
grant N00014-99-1-0501, and the Smithsonian Institution
Scholarly Studies Program. This work was supported in
part by the DOE under grant DE-FG02-91ER40661.

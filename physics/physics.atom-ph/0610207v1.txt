We investigate resonances of spin 1 bosons in a three-dimensional magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld.
Complementary to the well-known positive energy resonances it is shown that there exist short-
lived, i.e. broad, negative energy resonances. The latter are characterized by an atomic spin that is
aligned antiparallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld direction. In contrast to the positive energy resonances
the lifetimes of the negative energy resonances decreases with increasing total magnetic quantum
number. We derive a mapping of the two branches of the spectrum.

Magnetic traps represent a very powerful and versatile
tool to study ultracold atomic (or molecular) matter. In
particular they are very well-suited for miniaturization
via e.g. so-called atomchips [1, 2, 3] and consequently
allow a processing of matter waves at the micro or even
nanoscale. The basic idea behind the control of ultracold
atoms via inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds is very simple:
The neutral atoms couple to the magnetic ﬁeld via their
magnetic moment. Assuming strong hyperﬁne interac-
tions (compared to the magnetic interactions) the latter
is due to the total angular momentum being composed
of the electronic and nuclear angular momentum. Tradi-
tionally an adiabatic approximation, which reduces the
vector coupling of the magnetic moment to the ﬁeld to
a potential term proportional to the magnitude of the
ﬁeld, is then employed. However, in order to understand
the basic physics of (individual) atoms in magnetic traps
it is likewise necessary to study the quantum dynamics
of the Hamiltonian for the case of the vector coupling.
A number of investigations in this direction have been
performed in the past.

Firstly fundamental conﬁgurations of static ﬁelds for
the trapping of ground state atoms have been explored in
the late eighties and early nineties [4, 5]. Planar current
geometries for microscopic magnetic traps were inves-
tigated in ref.[6]. Speciﬁcally the magnetic quadrupole
ﬁeld [7], the wire trap [8] and the magnetic guide as well
as the Ioﬀe trap [9, 10, 11] have been addressed. Ex-
cept for the wire trap none of these conﬁgurations allow
for bound states and we observe exclusively a spectrum
of resonance states. Hinds and Eberlein [9, 10] analyze
the spectrum and decay rates of resonances of particles

with spin 1
2 and 1 in a magnetic guide by determining
the phase shift of scattered waves. Potvlieg´e and Zehnle
[11] employ the complex scaling method to obtain the
widths and positions of the resonance states. More re-
cently Lesanovsky and Schmelcher [12] studied the dy-
namics of neutral spin- 1
2 - and spin-1-particles in a 3D
magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld, equally to ref.[7], but perform
a much more extensive compilation of the properties of
the resonances including the derivation of an eﬀective
scalar Schr¨odinger equation to describe and understand
long-lived states possessing large angular momenta.

In the present work we investigate a new class of short-
lived resonances possessing negative energies for the case
of the 3D magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld. These resonances
have obviously been overlooked in previous investigations
and originate from a fundamental symmetry of the un-
derlying Hamiltonian. Their interpretation in terms of
spin anti-aligned transient states in the trap is outlined.
The Hamiltonian describing the motion of a point-
like particle of mass M and magnetic moment µ in a
3D magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld B = b(x, y,
2z) reads
H = p2
B. For a spin-S-particle with magnetic

Exploiting the discrete symmetries of the system, we

In order to investigate the resonances we employ the
method of complex scaling (see ref.[13] and references
therein). For the computational details we refer the
reader to ref.[12].

We shall see below that the spectrum consists of two
well-separated parts: One set of resonances localized in
the negative energy region with short lifetimes and a sec-
ond set localized in the positive energy domain where
the lifetimes are much larger and can, at least in prin-
ciple, become arbitrarily long. The positive energy res-
onances have already been investigated in several works
(see refs.[7, 12] and references therein) whereas, to our
knowledge, no negative energy resonances have been re-
ported up to date.

In Fig.1 we present the energies and decay widths
for positive energy resonances for a spin-1-particle. For
the total angular momentum m = 1 one observes the
resonances to cover the area of a right triangle in the
ǫ
Γ plane. They are located on lines with similar nega-
tive slopes. This pattern becomes increasingly disturbed
when considering resonances with higher energies and
small decay widths. For higher m values (see ﬁgure 1(b)
for m = 10) we observe a very regular pattern for their
distribution in the ǫ
Γ plane, still with a triangular
boundary, but now the resonances are located on lines
possessing a positive slope (for a discussion of the ori-
gin of this regular pattern see ref.[12]). The decay width
decreases exponentially with increasing value m for the
angular momentum. The larger the angular momentum
of a state the farther away it is located from the center
of the trap which is the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the
vicinity of the center spin-ﬂip transition from e.g. bound
to unbound states take place. With increasing angular

By analyzing the symmetry properties of the result-
ing Hamiltonian one obtains 15 discrete symmetries (see
ref.[12]). Apart from the discrete symmetries there is a
continuous symmetry generated by Jz = Lz +Sz which is
the z-component of the total angular momentum. This
is a consequence of the rotational invariance of the sys-
tem around the z-axis of the coordinate system. Due to
[Jz, H] = 0 one can ﬁnd energy eigenfunctions which are
simultaneously eigenfunctions of Jz. For a spin-S-particle
they read in the spatial representation

) of the spin component which points along the
local direction of the ﬁeld as a function of the energy for
the two cases m = 1 and m = 10. For the negative en-
ergy resonances this value is approximately
1 indicating
that the spin is aligned opposite to the local direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic moment is in the
same direction as the ﬁeld (we have assumed g > 0). For
positive energy resonances the spin is parallel to the local
ﬁeld and the magnetic moment is antiparallel.

It is instructive to consider the average value of the ra-
dial coordinate r as a function of the energy (see Fig.4) .
The resonances are distributed in an area possessing the
shape of a triangle. Again this pattern becomes increas-
ingly regular, when considering higher angular momenta
(see ﬁg.4(b)). Re(
) increases with increasing absolute

value of the energy which is in agreement with our above
argumentation with respect to the localization of the res-
onances.

FIG. 2: Decay width and energies of the resonances possessing

momentum the resonances probe less and less of this cen-
tral region and become therefore increasingly stable.

Fig.2 shows the energies and decay widths for the neg-
ative energy resonances. One immediately notices that
they are arranged somewhat similarly to the ones with
positive energy but on lines with a negative slope. The
pattern of their distribution becomes more regular for
higher m values. Unlike the positive energy resonances
their decay width increases with increasing angular mo-
mentum. States with a larger angular momentum expe-
rience a stronger magnetic ﬁeld and, as we shall show
below, the magnetic moment of the atom is parallel to
the local direction of the ﬁeld in case of a negative energy
resonance. Consequently the atom feels an increasingly
repelling force with respect to the trap center if the total
angular momentum increases. The latter leads to corre-
spondingly broader resonances.

The knowledge of the resonance eigenfunctions of the
complex-scaled Hamiltonian enables us to calculate cor-
responding expectation values of observables within the
generalized inner c
product being complex valued. The
real part represents the average value, whereas the imag-
inary part can be interpreted as the uncertainty of our
observable in a measurement when the system is prepared
in the corresponding resonance state (for more details see
[13]).

local direction of the magnetic ﬁeld for the positive and neg-
ative energy resonances for (a) m = 1 and (b) m = 10.

The results on the negative and positive energy reso-
nances suggest an intimate relationship among the two.
Indeed due to a complex symmetry, which we shall de-
rive in the following, there exists a mapping of the two
classes of resonances. The Schr¨odinger equation belong-
ing to the Hamiltonian which results when applying the

Therefore each resonance belonging to eq.(7) with
eigenvalue E possesses a counterpart i.e. a ’partner res-
onance’ with the eigenvalue ¯E = e−i2π/3E∗. We there-

nian the corresponding mirror line being placed at

which are in good agreement with the results of our nu-
merical calculations. Finally we remark that although
our study was performed for the speciﬁc case of a spin-1-
particle our conclusions hold for any boson with non-zero
spin and also for fermions.

Let us conclude. We observe, to our knowledge, for the
ﬁrst time negative energy resonances of spin-1-bosons in
a 3D quadrupole magnetic trap. The overall spectrum
is arranged in two disconnected parts each of which con-
tains exclusively resonances with positive and negative
energies. The latter are exclusively of short-lived char-
acter and the spin is antiparallel to the local direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld while for the former the spin is paral-
lel to the ﬁeld. As the total angular momentum of the
boson increases, the decay width of a negative energy
resonance state increases while for a positive energy res-
onance it decreases (assuming a typical laboratory gra-
dient ﬁeld 5T /m and the species Rb
87 the order of
magnitude for the lifetimes of the negative energy res-
onances is mikroseconds). A property of the complex

scaled Hamiltonian has been established which allows to
map the two branches of the spectrum.

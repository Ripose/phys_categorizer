Abstract. We describe an atom interferometer to study the coherence of atoms reﬂected from an evanescent
wave mirror. The interferometer is sensitive to the loss of phase coherence induced by the defects in the
mirror. The results are consistent with and complementary to recent measurements of specular reﬂection.

In the past 10 years, atom interferometry has found
a number of applications. Notable examples are atom gy-
rometers, gravimeters and accelerometers, measurements
of forward scattering amplitudes for elastic collisions, and
investigations of the Aharanov-Casher eﬀect [1]. Here we
demonstrate a new application: interferometric character-
ization of an atomic mirror.

∼

Using either dipole forces or magnetic ﬁelds, it is not
diﬃcult to make a “mirror”, i.e. a steep reﬂecting barrier,
strong enough to reﬂect atoms with velocities of order 1
m/s, the velocity acquired in
5 cm of free fall. Both
dipole and magnetic force mirrors can be coupled with a
high quality substrate to guarantee a well deﬁned over-
all ﬂatness or curvature, thus giving rise to the evanes-
cent wave mirror [2,3], or to the magnetic mirror [4]. It is
now well known however, that a fundamental diﬃculty of
atomic mirrors is loss of coherence due to various sources
of roughness in the reﬂecting potential [5,6,7,8]. The ex-
tremely small de Broglie wavelength associated with the
5 nm in the case of Rb at 1 m/s),
typical velocities (λdB ∼
imposes severe constraints on the small scale roughness
of the substrate – it must be much better than λdB/2π
[9] before the reﬂection can be considered specular, and
therefore coherent. This experiment is the ﬁrst in which
an atomic mirror is used within an interferometer and as
such is the ﬁrst true demonstration of its coherence.

In a previous paper [10], we reported measurements
of the velocity distribution of atoms from an atom mirror
and measured the fraction of specularly reﬂected atoms,
as well as the transverse velocity proﬁle of the diﬀusely re-
ﬂected ones. The resolution of this measurement however,
was insuﬃcient to study the lineshape of the specularly
reﬂected distribution – a crucial aspect characterizing the
eﬀect of the mirror on the coherence. Here we discuss a

related measurement which is able to focus in more de-
tail on the shape of the specularly reﬂected fraction. We
have developed an atom interferometer which gives infor-
mation complementary to velocity distribution measure-
ments. We observe fringes whose contrast as a function
of path diﬀerence corresponds to the coherence function
of the atomic mirror, in other words to the Fourier trans-
form of the transverse velocity distribution induced by
the mirror. This measurement is particularly sensitive to
the long distance behavior of the coherence function or
to the velocity distribution in the specular peak, where
direct velocity distribution measurements are impractical.
Narrower velocity selection implies fewer atoms and worse
signal to noise. The signal to noise in the interferometric
technique is practically independent of the velocity reso-
lution. It is the analog of Fourier transform spectroscopy
with de Broglie waves.

A diagram of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Atoms
from a MOT are subjected to two π/2 pulses which trans-
fer 2 recoil momenta to the atoms. Their time separation is
T . Only one of the internal atomic states is reﬂected by the
mirror as shown by the solid line paths. After reﬂection the
two paths are recombined by repeating the Raman pulse
sequence with the same separation time. The result is an
interferometer in which the two possible paths bounce oﬀ
diﬀerent parts of the mirror, separated by l = 2vRT , where
vR is the recoil velocity. By detecting atoms in only one of
the two internal states, interference fringes as a function
of the time T are visible as shown in Fig. 2. The actual
atomic trajectories are parabolic, but we have suppressed
this feature in the ﬁgure because the only role played by
gravity is to determine the de Broglie wavelength of the
atoms at the moment they hit the mirror.

The interferometer most resembles one ﬁrst discussed
in Ref. [11] and demonstrated in Ref. [12]. The diﬀerences
here are that we use 2 photon Raman transitions rather

than 1 photon transitions [13] and, more importantly, that
we have placed an atomic mirror within the interferometer
and use the fringes to study the inﬂuence of the mirror
on the spatial coherence of the reﬂected atoms. We isolate
the eﬀect of the mirror by comparing these fringes to those
obtained by applying all four pulses before the atoms hit
the mirror. These fringes are also shown in Fig. 2.

It is evident that the mirror strongly reduces the fringe
contrast, and we will discuss the information this reduc-
tion gives us below. But ﬁrst we will give some experi-
mental details of our setup. The apparatus is the same as
that used in Ref. [10], and the laser pulse sequence is very
similar. We refer the reader to Fig. 1 of that paper for the
energy level scheme. A 85Rb MOT is loaded with approx-
imately 108 atoms in 2 s. The atoms are prepared in the
F = 2 level by turning oﬀ the 2
3 repumping laser be-
fore the trapping beams. They fall under gravity towards
a glass prism 20 mm below. Starting 8 ms after the atoms
begin to fall, two counter–propagating Raman beams are
pulsed on twice for 25 µs, with a period T between the
start of the two pulses. The two–photon detuning of the
ﬁrst pulse pair is δ1 = ωa
ωHFS where ωb and ωa are
ωb
the frequencies of the two Raman lasers, ωHFS is the hy-
perﬁne splitting in 85Rb, corrected for the atomic recoils
involved in the transition. The laser parameters are such
that the π/2 condition is fulﬁlled for δ1 = 0.

A homogeneous magnetic bias ﬁeld (750 mG), in the
propagation direction of the Raman beams, ensures that
only atoms in the hyperﬁne sublevel
un-
dergo a transition (into
). The evanescent
i
wave laser is switched on for 20 ms, timed to coincide with
the arrival of the atoms at the prism, and a second pair of
Raman pulses, separated by the same period T , with two–
photon detuning δ2, is applied. After the 4 pulse sequence,

detuning was 2 GHz.

atoms that are not transferred to F = 2 are expelled by
a 2 ms pulse of light resonant for F = 3. Finally a probe
beam with repumper is switched on, and the resulting ﬂu-
orescence signal is measured with a photomultiplier tube.
The evanescent wave mirror is described in more detail in
Ref. [14]. The evanescent wave is red–detuned from reso-
nance for F = 2, but blue–detuned for F = 3. Thus, F = 3
atoms are reﬂected. As in Ref. [10], the evanescent wave
detuning ∆EW/2π is chosen between 500 and 2000 MHz.
For more details on the Raman laser setup see [15,16].

Some atoms that do not undergo a transition stimu-
lated by the ﬁrst Raman pulse pair can still undergo a
transition by spontaneous emission. These atoms make a
background in our data that we measure with a second
sequence this time with δ1 detuned away from resonance.
This measured background is subtracted from the origi-
nal signal. To make observations without the mirror, we
proceed in an analogous manner except that the atoms
are initially prepared in the F = 3 state and a pushing
laser which eliminates the atoms remaining in F = 3 is
applied between the 2nd and 3rd pulses. Also, all four Ra-
man pulses, as well as the detection take place before the
atoms hit the mirror.

To interpret the results, we will analyze the interfer-
ometer in terms of atom interferometry. An equivalent,
velocity space interpretation is possible if one observes
that the 1st two Raman pulses produce two interlaced
combs in velocity space corresponding to the two diﬀer-
ent atomic internal states [17]. The velocity space analysis
proceeds by examining the eﬀect of the mirror on the ve-
locity distribution. In the interferometric analysis below,
we work in position space and treat the atoms quantum
mechanically only along the x (horizontal) direction. The
x-component of the momentum is denoted p. To treat the
eﬀect of the mirror, we use the thin phase grating approxi-
mation [18,9], which supposes that the atomic trajectories
are unperturbed by mirror roughness while within the re-
ﬂecting potential, and that the mirror roughness simply
adds a phase ϕ(x) = 4π
λdB s(x) (this quantity is referred to
as δϕ(x) in Ref.[9]) to the matter wavefront. The quantity
s corresponds to the local vertical deviation of the mirror
from a perfectly ﬂat surface.

The atomic source has an rms velocity spread δv, or
equivalently a coherence length ξ = ¯h/(mδv). We will take
the ﬁnite coherence length into account by analyzing what
in the interferometer
happens to an initial pure state
and then performing an appropriate, incoherent, average
over the possible states
. For example, the initial state
i
could correspond to a plane wave, in which case the av-
erage is over the velocity distribution of the source, or it
could be considered as a wave packet. The paths in Fig. 1
can be interpreted as the trajectories of the center of mass
of such a wavepacket. Taking into account the nonzero de-
tuning of the Raman laser results in a relative phase δiT
(i = 1 or 2) for each of the vertical sections of the tra-
jectories between the 1st and 4th Raman pulses. At the
output of the interferometer, after the fourth π/2 pulse,
the part of the state vector corresponding to atoms in the
F = 2 state is given by:

In the above analysis, we have made the approxima-
tion that the duration of the π/2 pulses can be neglected,
compared to all other time scales in the problem. In our
experiment this duration is not negligible and results in
an rms transverse velocity selection of the atoms by each
pulse corresponding to δvSel = 4.04/(2kLaserτ ), where τ is
the duration of the Blackman pulse and the factor 4.04
converts the total duration of the Blackman pulse into an
rms width (i.e. a 1/√e half width). For a 25 µs pulse, this
selection corresponds to a 1 cm/s rms velocity width, or
an “eﬀective” coherence length of ξ = 80 nm. In this case
the coherence requirement which permits one to neglect
any interference of the paths a and d is that the path sep-
aration l be greater than this eﬀective coherence length.
Taking into account the ﬁnite duration of the pulses also
modiﬁes the contrast if the value of the pulse separation
T is close to τ . This eﬀect is very small but is taken into
account in the ﬁts described below. A more detailed cal-
culation can be found in Ref.[16].

The experiment of Ref. [10], showed that the reﬂected
velocity distribution from the mirror is bimodal, having
both a broad (diﬀuse) and a narrow (specular) component.
This reference identiﬁed both mirror roughness and spon-
taneous emission as the primary causes of diﬀuse reﬂec-
tion. We therefore also expect a bimodal coherence func-
tion, consisting of a narrow part (corresponding to diﬀuse
reﬂection), and a wide part corresponding to specular re-
ﬂection. In terms of the coherence lengths, Ref. [10] found
a length of about 100 nm for the diﬀuse part of the coher-
ence function, while only a lower limit of about 1000 nm
(0.1 vR) could be given for the specular part. In the ex-
periment reported here, the minimal time separation, T =
40 µs, corresponds to a path separation of 480 nm in the
interferometer. Thus the shape of the diﬀusely reﬂected
distribution is inaccessible in the present experiment. The
only eﬀect of diﬀuse reﬂection is a loss of contrast, even for
T = 40 µs, approximately equal to the fraction S of spec-
ularly reﬂected atoms. According to Ref. [10], this fraction
is well described by: S = exp (
α/∆EW), where the value
of α comes from a ﬁt and is compared to a calculation.

In Fig. 3, we plot the fringe visibility of several runs
similar to those shown in Fig. 2 as a function of the evanes-
cent wave mirror detuning ∆EW. The data were obtained
δ1. The ﬁt shown
for ﬁxed T (40 µs) and a varying δ2 −
α/∆EW) times a con-
in the ﬁgure corresponds to exp (
stant. The data conﬁrm our model of the loss of contrast
and the ﬁt yields α =1.5 GHz, in reasonable agreement
with the value found in Ref. [10]. One of the advantages
of the interferometry technique compared to the simple
velocity spectroscopy approach is evident from the error
bars and dispersion of the data in Fig. 3. They are much
smaller than in Fig. 4 of Ref. [10], and indeed the value of
α deduced here is probably more reliable.

−

We turn now to the long range behavior of the coher-
ence function. Fig. 4 shows the behavior of the fringe vis-
ibility as a function of the delay T for a evanescent wave
detuning that was ﬁxed at ∆EW = 2 GHz. The results
show that the contrast decreases rapidly to zero for delays
above 100 µs. A Gaussian ﬁt to the data in Fig. 4 gives
a 1/√e half width of 110 µs. In terms of the correlation
length, this result corresponds to a length of 1.3 µm, just
barely longer that the upper limit established in Ref. [10].
This result was unexpected.

The loss of contrast can be most easily explained by
a small tilt in the mirror relative to the vertical (Raman

velocity measurements determined it to be 11 mrad). Be-
cause of the tilt, the vertical velocity distribution of the
atoms when they hit the mirror contributes to the hor-
izontal velocity width after the bounce. The dominant
contribution to the vertical velocity distribution comes
from the vertical size of the MOT. An rms MOT size of
1.7 mm results in a 0.58 mm/s horizontal velocity spread,
and this would account for our observation. The size of
the MOT was not measured during the experiment, but
1.7 mm is plausible. We have considered other mechanisms
for the loss of contrast such as curvature of the mirror sur-
face, the shape of the waist of the bouncing laser beam,
or diﬀraction of atoms from the edges. None of these is
large enough to account for the observed loss of contrast.
Note that even if the amount of spontaneous emission es-
timated in Ref. [10] is incorrect, it cannot account for the
loss of contrast in Fig. 4 because its intrinsic length scale

parted to the atoms). The length scale we observe in Fig.
4 for the loss of contrast is much larger.

The main conclusion of our work is that, as in tradi-
tional optics, interferometry constitutes an extremely sen-
sitive test of mirror surface quality. The interferometer is
very well compensated for many parasitic eﬀects eﬀects,
such as the incoherence of the source, frequency ﬂuctua-
tions of the lasers etc., as shown by the essentially perfect
contrast observed without the mirror. Defects in the mir-
ror are readily apparent, and can be easily quantiﬁed as

shown by the small error bars in Figs. 3 and 4. The in-
terferometer is sensitive to coherence lengths much larger
than are accessible to straightforward velocity distribution
measurements.

We report on high-resolution two-color photoassociation spectroscopy in the triplet system of
magneto-optically trapped 6Li. Photoassociation is induced from the ground-state asymptote to the
v = 59 level of the excited 13Σ+
g state. This level is coupled to the v = 9 level of the triplet ground
state a3Σ+
u by the light ﬁeld of a Raman laser. The absolute transition frequencies are measured
with an iodine frequency standard and the binding energy of the ground state is determined to
24.391 ± 0.020 GHz. Strong coupling of the bound molecular states has been observed as Autler-
Townes splitting in the photoassociation signal for diﬀerent detunings of the Raman laser. From
the splitting we determine the spontaneous bound-bound decay rate to 4.3 × 105 s−1 and estimate
the molecule formation rate. The observed lineshapes are in good agreement with the theoretical
model.

Coherent coupling schemes oﬀer intriguing novel pos-

schemes, the continuum state of a free atom pair is cou-
pled to a rovibrational level of the molecular ground
state. Magnetic coupling in the vicinity of a Feshbach
resonance has led to the observation of atom-molecule
coherence in a 85Rb BEC [1] and to the selective pro-
duction of weakly bound Cs2 dimers [2]. Optical cou-
pling in stimulated Raman transitions has allowed for
the creation of 87Rb molecules in a BEC [3] and of
Cs2 molecules from a magneto-optically trapped atomic
cloud [4].
In contrast to single-color photoassociation
experiments, where cold ground-state molecules are pro-
duced incoherently by spontaneous decay of the optically
excited dimer [5, 6, 7], these transitions schemes have co-
herent character. Thereby, ground-state molecules are
produced in a speciﬁc rovibrational level.
In addition,
the molecule formation rate can be strongly enhanced,
as it is not limited by the small branching ratio between
the bound-bound and the bound-free transitions. This
is especially important for the formation of dimers with
small intrinsic molecule formation rates, as in case of
the absence of any favorable peculiarities in their poten-
tials [5, 7]. While magnetic coupling schemes require a
Feshbach resonance at suﬃciently low magnetic ﬁelds and
allow only for the production of cold molecules in weakly
bound states, optical coupling schemes are more univer-
sal. Moreover, in extended multi-color versions, they are
proposed for the production of molecules which are not
only translationally, but also vibrationally cold [8].
Among the cold homonuclear dimers, 6Li2 molecules in
the triplet state are particularly interesting. Combining
two 6Li atoms to a 6Li2 molecule corresponds to trans-
fering a Fermionic system into a Bosonic system. Such
transition schemes are prerequisite for studying the ef-

fects of diﬀerent quantum statistics on the reaction dy-
namics, the so-called superchemistry [9]. If, in addition,
the molecule is prepared in the triplet state, it has a mag-
netic dipole moment. Storing these cold molecules in a
magnetic trap should be possible, as demonstrated for
cesium triplet dimers in a magnetic quadrupole trap re-
cently [10].
In this paper we report on two-color photoassociation
in the triplet system of 6Li2. We use a Raman-type
coupling scheme as shown in Fig. 1. Photoassociation
is induced from the hyperﬁne ground-state asymptote
f = 1/2 + f = 3/2 into the excited triplet 13Σ+
g state
by the photoassociation laser with frequency νPA. From
the excited rovibrational level v = 59, N = 1, the speciﬁc
hyperﬁne state |1111i (|N SIGi-notation, see e.g. [12])

toassociation is induced from the ground-state asymptote
1/2 + 3/2 into the hyperﬁne state |1111i of the excited level
v = 59. The Raman laser couples this excited level to the hy-
perﬁne state |0111i of the ground-state vibrational level v = 9.

is selected. The excited level lies at a laser detuning of
−1787 GHz relative to the D1-line, corresponding to a
Condon point of about 34 a0. The natural linewidth is
approximately twice the atomic value Γ and amounts to
2π×11.7 MHz [11]. The Raman laser of the frequency νR
couples the excited state to the hyperﬁne state |0111i of
the v = 9, N = 0 level of the triplet ground state a3Σ+
u .
The ground-state level has a binding energy of approx-
imately −24 GHz and an outer turning point of 27 a0.
The binding energies and the hyperﬁne structure involved
in this scheme have been determined in photoassocia-
tion experiments of R. Hulet and co-workers [12, 13]. In
our experiments we focus on an absolute frequency mea-
surement of the bound-free and the bound-bound transi-
tion and therefrom we deduce the binding energy of the
ground state. Furthermore, we study the inﬂuence of the
detunig of the ﬁxed Raman laser on the photoassociation
signal. Autler-Townes splitting in the two-color photoas-
sociation signal is observed, which arises from the strong
coupling of the bound molecular states. We discuss the
lineshape in the light of the theory of Bohn and Juli-
enne [14]. From the amount of the splitting we deduce the
spontaneous decay rate and estimate the molecule forma-
tion rate. These results on the Autler-Townes splitting
are complementary to recent two-color photoassociation
experiments with cesium [4].
For the magneto-optical trap we use the two-species ap-
paratus as described in [15], but operate it with 6Li only.
We apply a detuning of −5 Γ for the cooling transition
and of −2 Γ for the repumping transition. The tem-
perature of the atomic ensemble can be estimated to
0.5 mK [16]. The particle number is monitored by ab-
sorption from a weak probe beam. For the photoassocia-
tion light we use a grating-stabilized diode laser with an
output power of 12 mW. The light of the Raman beam
is derived from a dye laser with 500 mW output power.
The two laser beams are superimposed with parallel po-
larization and adjustable relative laser powers. The 1/e2
diameters of the laser beams at the position of the atomic
cloud amount to 550 µm, corresponding to peak intensi-
ties of up to IR = 40 W/cm2 for the Raman laser and of
up to IPA = 7 W/cm2 for the photoassociation laser. The
stabilization and tuning of the diode laser is achieved by
means of a stabilization chain. The diode is locked to
a Fabry-Perot etalon with 300 MHz free spectral range.
This etalon is stabilized relative to a second diode laser,
which is again stabilized to a reference diode laser by
a heterodyne technique. This reference laser is locked to
an atomic lithium resonance by radio-frequency sideband
spectroscopy in a lithium cell. Absolute frequency cali-
bration is achieved by a Doppler-free iodine ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy with an accuracy of 10 MHz [17]. The scan
rate is chosen to 0.5-1 MHz/s for the absolute frequency
measurements and to 0.36 MHz/s for the Autler-Townes
measurements. This is slow as compared to the loading
time of the trap of 15 s. Thereby a resolution of a few

MHz is achieved.
For the absolute frequency measurement of the photoas-
sociation and the Raman transition we proceed in the
following manner. First, we record the single-color pho-
toassociation spectrum and the iodine spectrum in the
relevant frequency range simultaneously. For this spe-
cial case we use the dye laser to induce photoassociation
because of its larger tuning range. In order to keep the
inﬂuence of the light shift [18] small, we reduce the laser
intensity to 3 W/cm2. For the transition from the hy-
perﬁne ground-state asymptote f = 1/2 + f = 3/2 into
the speciﬁc excited hyperﬁne state we determine the fre-
quency to 445002.881 ± 0.015GHz. A redshift of 10 MHz
due to the thermal energy of the atoms has been in-
cluded in this analysis. Then, the photoassociation laser
is held ﬁxed on this transition, which leads to a decrease
in the steady-state particle number of the trapped atoms
to 75%. The Raman laser is scanned with an intensity
of 10 W/cm2. An increase in the particle number reveals
resonance frequency of the Raman laser with the bound-
bound transition, which lies at 445027.272 ± 0.013 GHz
(Fig. 2). At our relatively high Raman laser intensities,
this reduction of decrease originates from the strong cou-
pling of the bound molecular states by the Raman laser
(see below), as a consequence of which the photoassocia-
tion laser is no longer resonant with the free-bound tran-
sition and particle losses due to photoassociation are sup-
pressed. The binding energy of the bound ground-state

level v = 9 in the absence of hyperﬁne structure is equiv-
alent to the diﬀerence between the measured transition
frequencies, because the initial and ﬁnal level are shifted
due to the hyperﬁne structure by the same amount. We
obtain a value of 24.391 ± 0.020 GHz. The uncertainty is
mainly due to a possible systematic error in the iodine
reference spectrum and moreover due to the error in the
determination of the line position. Our result is in agree-
ment with the value of 24.43 ± 0.02 GHz obtained from a
direct measurement of the frequency diﬀerence [12].
The lineshape of the two-photon signal shows strong
asymmetries with a shallow slope at the low frequency
side and a steep slope at the high frequency side. We
determine the linewidth (full width at half maximum) to
15 MHz. Therewith, the linewidth is smaller than the
convolution of the natural linewidth of 11.7 MHz and the
thermal broadening of about 10 MHz. The lineshape is
that of a typical Fano proﬁle [19, 20], which has been
analyzed experimentally in [21].
For the Autler-Townes measurements, we ﬁrst tune the
Raman laser into resonance with the bound-bound tran-
sition for calibration. Then, a ﬁxed detuning ∆R is added
and the photoassociation laser is scanned. Two-color
photoassociation spectra for three diﬀerent detunings ∆R
of the Raman laser are shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum
in the middle has been taken in presence of a resonant
Raman laser (∆R = 0 MHz). For the outer spectra, the
Raman laser was detuned by the same amount of 30 MHz
to the red and to the blue respectively. For these spec-
tra, the laser intensities were chosen to 30 W/cm2 for the
Raman laser and to 3 W/cm2 for the photoassociation
laser. All three resonances show a doublet structure with
a splitting of several 10 MHz. In the case of the resonant
Raman laser, the resonance is split into two peaks with
equal depth. For a detuned Raman laser, the splitting
is asymmetric with a larger peak on the high-frequency
side for red detuning and with a larger peak on the low-
frequency side for blue detuning. To determine the split-

E/h = 10 MHz and rate coeﬃcient K for a temperature of
0.5 mK for three diﬀerent detunings ∆R of the Raman laser.
For the Rabi frequency Ω = 2π × 30 MHz and for the natu-
ral linewidth γ = 12 MHz were assumed. The frequency axis
is relative to the transition frequency for vanishing energy.
To compare the calculation with the experimental data, the
ordinate is plotted upside-down.

ting we ﬁt two Lorentzian functions to the data. For the
resonant Raman laser the spacing between the maxima
of the resonances amounts to 34.6 MHz. For the detuned
Raman laser the spacing is 50.1 MHz and 40.4 MHz re-
spectively.
The origin of the splitting can be explained in the
dressed-state picture [20]. Here, the two bound molec-
ular states are dressed with the light ﬁeld of the Ra-
man laser, forming a ladder of doublets that are sepa-
rated by the generalized Rabi frequency Ωgen/2π.
Its
value depends on the detuning ∆R of the Raman laser
and of the Rabi frequency Ω (see below) according to
Ωgen/2π = p∆2
R + (Ω/2π)2. By spectroscopy with a
weak laser beam from a third level this splitting appears
as an Autler-Townes doublet [22]. In the case considered
here, this third level corresponds to the continuum state.
A more sophisticated model, also including lineshapes,
is given by Bohn and Julienne [14]. This description is
based on scattering theory and yields a general analytic
expression for the two-color photoassociation scattering
probability |S|2. For a thermal ensemble, the correspond-
ing rate coeﬃcient K is obtained by thermal averaging.
The results of a simulation for the corresponding parame-
ters of our experiment are shown in Fig. 4. In this theory,
the origin of the splitting is explained by two maxima of
the scattering probability |S|2 as a function of the pho-
toassociation laser frequency νPA. The magnitude of the
splitting is independent of the scattering energy E and
corresponds to the generalized Rabi frequency Ωgen. By

thermal averaging over the scattering energies, the dif-
ferent resonance widths in the scattering probability |S|2
translate into diﬀerent heights of the doublet peaks of the
rate coeﬃcient K. However, thermal averaging does not
change the amount of the splitting substantially, which
we have checked for various parameters. The thermal av-
eraged resonances are asymmetric. The high-frequency
sides are always steeper. This is due to the convolu-
tion of the small intrinsic linewidth of the transition with
the Boltzmann distribution of the scattering energies E.
Thereby, contributions from low energies, corresponding
to higher frequencies, are favored.
The measured trap loss (Fig. 3) is proportional to the
calculated photoassociation rate coeﬃcient K (Fig. 4), if
a linear response of the steady-state particle number to
the rate coeﬃcient K is assumed. For low photoasso-
ciation laser intensities this approximation is justiﬁed.
The agreement concerning the splitting and the relative
heights of the peaks between experiment and theory is
quite good. Moreover, the asymmetry due to the thermal
averaging is visible in the experimental spectra, particu-
larly for the spectrum with ∆R = −30 MHz.
For the experimental determination of the Rabi fre-
quency Ω, we use the data taken for a resonant Raman
laser. In this case the generalized Rabi frequency Ωgen
is identical to the Rabi frequency Ω and independent of
uncertainties in the detuning of the Raman laser. There-
fore, the measured splitting of 34.6 MHz can be identiﬁed
with the Rabi frequency Ω/2π. By using the relation
for the Rabi frequency Ω = p3c2IRΓbb/4πhν3
R, we deter-
mine the transition rate Γbb between the bound states
to 4.3 × 105 s−1. This coincides well with a value of
6.16 × 105 s−1 [8], derived theoretically from a simpli-
ﬁed two-level system.
The experimental data allow an estimation of the molec-
ular formation rate per atom and per second. For the
resonant Raman laser, each doublet peak consists of con-
tributions from the molecular ground state and from the
excited state to equal parts. Thereby, the molecule for-
mation rate should be given by half the single-color pho-
toassociation rate. The photoassociation rate itself can
be estimated from the 87% reduction of the steady-state
number of 6Li atoms in presence of the photoassociation
laser (see Fig. 3). Assuming constant density and using
the measured value for the loading time of the trap, we
use the formula given in [23]. We receive a value for
the photoassociation rate in the range of 0.01 s−1 per
atom, leading to a molecule formation rate in the same
order of magnitude. This is an enhancement by a factor
of 100 compared to the molecule formation rate due to
single-color photoassociation, which can be estimated to
8.4 × 10−5 s−1 by multiplying the photoassociation rate
with the branching ratio between the bound-bound and
the free-bound transitions [8]. For typical particle num-
bers in the order of 108 atoms [15], the absolute molecule
formation rate amounts to 106 molecules/s. However, in

4

order to estimate the number of formed molecules, loss
processes, such as spontaneous Raman scattering, have
to be taken into account.
In conclusion, we have performed high-resolution two-
color photoassociation spectroscopy in the triplet system
of the 6Li2 molecule. The binding energy of the last
bound level of the ground state has been determined in
an absolute frequency measurement. We have observed
the Autler-Townes splitting in the two-color photoasso-
ciation signal and therefrom deduced the bound-bound
transition rate and the molecule formation rate. This
rate is suﬃciently high to encourage future experiments
in this transition scheme. These are the accumulation of
the cold triplet dimers in a magnetic trap and the pro-
duction of vibrationally cold ground-state molecules via
multi-color photoassociation schemes. For the degener-
ate regime, even pulsed schemes such as STIRAP [24] are
discussed.

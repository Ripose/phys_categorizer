Correlations in Many Electron Systems:
Theory and Applications

M. Tomaselli, T. K ¨uhl, D. Ursescu, and S. Fritzsche

1

Abstract: In this contribution we present calculations performed for interacting electron
systems within a non-perturbative formulation of the cluster theory. Extrapolation of the
model to describe the time dependence of the interacting systems is feasible and planed.
The theory is based on the unitary operator eiS (S is the correlation operator) formalism
which, in this paper, is treated non perturbatively within many-particle correlations. The
application of the derived equations to few-body systems is realized in terms of Generalized
Linearization Approximations (GLA) and via the Cluster Factorization Theory (CFT). To
check the reliability of the model we present two different applications. In the ﬁrst we
evaluate the transitions energies in Helium-, Lithium-, Beryllium-, and Boron-like Oxygen.
The calculation aims to a precise determination of the satellite transitions which play an
important role in plasma diagnostics. In a second we investigate a non-perturbative method
to evaluate the charge radii of the Helium and Lithium isotopes by using the Isotopic Shift
theory. We have found that our model leads naturally to components of e− − e+ pair in the
two-electron wave functions of the Helium isotopes and three-electron wave functions of the
Lithium isotopes. The possible connection of these terms to the QED leading diagrams is
postulated.

1. Introduction

Deriving a non-perturbative and microscopic theory capable to describe the basic observable that char-
acterize the dynamics of interacting electrons is a fundamental problem in the physics of atoms and
ions. In general, one faces with two fundamental tasks, namely, the consideration of the correlation
effects and the introduction of a cut-off parameter which, in order to obtain realistic and solvable sys-
tems, reduces the dimensions of the model Equation of Motion (EoM). The introduction of correlation
effects in many body systems via the eiS Unitary-Model Operator (UMO) goes back to the early work
of Villars [1]. The idea is to introduce a wave operator S which maps zero-order reference wave func-
tions (usually Hartree-Fock wave functions) to exact many body wave functions. Extended applications
of the method in nuclear physics were shortly after performed by Shakin [2]. The eiS method came to
quantum chemistry with the coupled cluster method proposed by Coester [3], and K¨ummel [4]. The
coupled cluster Hamiltonian has been recently applied to the calculations of the electron afﬁnities of al-
kali atoms [5]. Studies of correlation effects in atomic systems based on the coupled cluster theory have
been performed by Das et al. [6]. Recently [7, 8] the eiS method was applied within nonperturbative ap-

proximations (Dynamic Correlation Model (DCM) and Boson Dynamic Correlation Model (BDCM))
to open shell nuclei. Applications of the method to open-shell electron systems were ﬁrstly applied to
calculate the Hyperﬁne Splitting (HFS) constants of Lithium-like bismuth and uranium [10, 12]. The
resulting non-perturbative and relativistic electron Dynamic Correlation Model (eDCM) was applied
to calculate the effect produced by the electron and nucleon correlations into the isotopic shift theory
IS. Calculations for lithium atoms were presented in [13]. Additionally the method ﬁnds application
in the evaluation of dielectronic satellite-spectra of Lithium-like ions [14, 15, 16]. These are a useful
tool for diagnostic of laser produced plasma. The ratio of various components of the satellite lines have
been shown to be sensitive to density and temperature.

We start by describing free electron systems with a relativistic shell model in which the wave func-
tions are solution of the Dirac’s equation. The model vacuum consists in paired electrons to ﬁll major
shells. The electrons in excess are considered as valence particles. The interaction between the elec-
trons is responsible for exciting the valence electrons and for causing correlation effects in the closed
shells. In additions to this polarization mechanism we have also the polarization of the continuum
states. This polarization effects named Boiling of the Vacuum (BoV), have been already introduced
in [10]. As in Ref. [7] we start by deﬁning the basic operators of the model and by determining the
relative EoM. The complex excitations modes are classiﬁed in terms of electron Conﬁguration Mix-
ing Wave Functions (eCMWFs). The eCMWFs form an orthogonal base of coupled clusters in which
the Pauli principle between the different clusters is taken fully in consideration. Extrapolation of the
non-perturbative cluster model to describe the time dependent electron-laser interaction is feasible and
planed.

In this contribution we present two applications of the non perturbative eDCM. The ﬁrst involves
the evaluation of the relativistic transition energies and wave functions for the Oxygen ions ranging
from the Helium-like to the Boron-like. In the second application we study the dynamics of few-
electron systems interacting with the excitation of the positron-continuum. The effect of this excitations
is important in the determination of a non perturbative descriptions of the Mass Shift (MS) and Field-
Shift (FS) which characterize the Isotopic Shift (IS) theory.

2. Theory

We start with a set of exact eigenstates {|νi} of the Dirac’s Hamiltonian:

hi = c ~αi ~pi + (β − 1) + vnucl(ri)

which satisﬁes the dynamical equation

H|νi = Eν |νi .

In dealing with many electron systems one has to add the correlation effects caused by the two-body
interactions: V (ij)Coul and V (ij)Breit to the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1). Shell model calculation can be
then performed to calculate transition energies between the different levels. Shell model calculations
represent however an approximation in that one usually treats the effects of only few shells. The ne-
glected shells serve to re-normalize the interaction in the shells considered. The re-normalization of the
Hamiltonian is generally introduced via correlation operators. In UMO the effective Hamiltonian is cal-
culated by introducing the correlations via the unitary eiS operator. By using only two body correlation
we can derive:

Ψαβ = eiS2Φαβ

where v12 is the two body interaction and the Ψαβ is the two particle correlated wave function:

However in dealing with complex atoms the (Si, i = 3 · · · n) correlations should also be consid-
ered. The evaluation of these diagrams is, due to the exponentially increasing number of terms, difﬁcult
in a perturbation theory.

We note that one way to overcome this problem is to work with ei(S1+S2+S3+···+Si) operator on

the Slater’s determinant of the different states by keeping the n-body Hamiltonian uncorrelated.

After having performed the diagonalization of eigenvalue matrix obtained from the matrix elements
of the n-body uncorrelated Hamilton’s operator, we can calculate the form of the effective Hamiltonian
which, by now, includes correlation operators of complex order.

The amplitudes of the correlated determinant are the calculated in the EoM method which is illus-

trated in the following.

If |0i denotes some physical vacuum and O†

where T is the kinetic energy operator and Vint the interactions (VCoul+VBreit), and the c†, c the general
fermion operators. When they act on valence subspace, the c† and c creates and annihilates a valence
electron, respectively. On the other hand, when they act on core subspace, the c† and c respectively
annihilates and creates a hole state. Hence, the summation of the Greek subscripts leads to particle-
particle, particle-hole, as well as hole-hole interactions.

It is useful to determine the form of the central potential before the diagonalization of the model
space is performed. This is because the matrix elements of the EoM can often be more easily calculated
in a pre-diagonalization basis.

The coefﬁcients Ωbr are simply the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. To see this, we take the
matrix element of both sides of Eq. (10) between the states hs| and |0i. Upon using the orthogonality
between the basis vectors (i.e. hs|O†

r|0i = δrs), one obtains

If the model space consists of a ﬁnite number, N , of basis vectors, then going from Eq. (10) back to
Eq. (6) is equivalent to associate the systems of coupled equations given in Eq. (11) to the eigenvalues
matrix equation given below:

Ωsr = hs|H|ri − E0δsr .

(O − E 1) x = 0

where O represents the (N × N ) matrix Ω, 1 the N -dimensional unit matrix, and x are the projections
of the model space into the basic vectors.

Equations (10) and (11) indicate that the complexity of solving Eq. (12) depends on the complexity
of the model space, {|bi}, and the Hamiltonian, H. The following comparative review of the construc-
tion of model spaces in different structure theories should give a glimpse on the scope of the problem.

Let O†

m be the operator that creates n valence electrons outside the closed shells state |Φ0i :

|mi ≡ O†

m(αm; j1j2 · · · jn) =

a†
ji |Φ0i = |αm; j1j2 · · · jni .

In the simplest case where there is no closed shell excitation, the O†

m satisﬁes the EoM, Eq. (10)

[H, O†

m(αm; j1j2 · · · jn)] =

Ωmm′O†

m′ (αm′ ; j′

with αm and αm′ denoting the quantum numbers of the states |mi and |m′i, respectively.

The inert-core approximation would be good only if the valence-core interaction is very small.
Hence, the applicability of the inert-core approximation is very limited as the interaction between
valence and core electrons will generally excite the shell-model ground state of the core and create,
in the process, the particle-hole (ph) pairs. Inclusion of the excitation mode due to 1p1h in the model
space is known as the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) [17]. If one deﬁnes

are the conﬁguration mixing coefﬁcients and |0iT DA denotes the physical vacuum of the TDA. In the
literature one often chooses |0iT DA = |HF i, with |HF i being the Hartree-Fock ground state of the
ion. In this latter case, O†

m′ = 1 in Eq. (16).

It is also possible to use a physical vacuum that already contains ph pairs. In the literature, the
method of random phase approximation (EPA) [17] has been introduced to study the full effects due to
the pre-existence of 1p1h component in the physical vacuum. Hence, in RPA

If the RPA is applied to closed-shell, then again O†

The introduction of the excitations of the vacuum in the above mentioned approximation is however
complicated by the fact that the TDA and RPA vacua are different then the vacuum of the single
particle operators. In addition simple calculations can be performed only by prediagonalizing the many
body Hamiltonian in the TDA and RPA subspaces. The coupling to the additional valence particles
can afterwards be accomplished by considering only few collective states and by neglecting the full
treatment of the Pauling principle. In the following we show that these complications can be overcome
by extending the EoM method to the ﬁeld of non-linear equations.

2.1. Polarization of the closed shells versus continuum vacuum excitations

In the eDCM, the model space is expanded to include multiple ph excitations. This dynamic mech-
anism includes either the excitations of closed electron shells or of positron-continuum states. More
speciﬁcally [8], the eDCM states are classiﬁed according to the number of the valence electrons and
of the electron particle-hole pair arising either from closed shells or from the positron-continuum. A
state of N paired valence electrons and N ′ particle-hole closed shells electrons or e− − e+ positron-
continuum states is deﬁned by

where J denotes the total spin and the α′s the other quantum numbers. The unprimed indices 1, . . . , n
label the valence particle-particle pairs ( the valence bosons) and the primed indices 1′, . . . , n′ label
the particle-hole pairs (the core electrons). The Ji’s denote the coupling of the pairs and the coupling
of the different Ji is for simplicity omitted. The X’s are projections of the model states to the basic
vectors of Eq. (19).

Within this deﬁnition the model space included either the excitation of the closed shells or the
dynamics of continuum excitation which is taken into account through coupling the valence electron
states to e− − e+ states. The electron states deﬁned in Eq. (19) are classiﬁed in terms of conﬁguration
mixing wave functions (eCMWFs) of increasing degrees of complexity (number of particle-hole or of
e− − e+ pairs), see Ref. [7].

Since the different subspaces should be rotational invariant we introduce the coupling of the parti-
cles and particle-holes in such a way that the ﬁrst pair is coupled to angular momentum J1 , the second

where |0i is the shell-model state. Furthermore, we have used the notation pxhy for the indices of
Ω to indicate the relevant xp − yh conﬁguration. The additional commutator equations here are not
given. In order to obtain eigenvalue equations we need to introduce a cut-off parameter: the GLA [7],
which consists by applying the Wick’s theorem to the A†
N +2′(βN +2′ (J1J2 · · · JN +2′ )J) terms and by
neglecting the normal order. This linearization mechanism generates the additional terms that convert
the commutator chain in the corresponding eigenvalue equation, as can be obtained by taking the
expectation value of the linearized Eqs. (23) and 24) between the vacuum and the model states.

Using the anticommutation relations and the Wick’s algebra, one veriﬁes easily that H can only
connect states that differ by 1p1h. The eigenvalue equation, Eq. (11), at the second-order linearization
level is given by Eq. (25) where the subscripts referring to particle-hole conﬁgurations were not written
explicitly but are understood. Note that in Eq. (25) ΩαpN β′′pN +2h2 = Ωα′′pN +2h2 βpN = 0.

The self-consistent method of solving Eq. (25) is given in detail in Ref. [8]. Here, we mention
among others that in solving Eq. (25) the two-body interactions of H automatically generates nonlocal
three-, four-interactions and so on.

The diagonalization of Eq. (25) can be performed only if one can calculate the many-body matrix
elements. Calculations are feasible with the use of the Wick’s algebra. However the number of terms
to be evaluated increase exponentially and calculations are very slow. In this work, we perform calcu-
lations by using the CFT of Ref. [7, 8, 11]. We believe that with the mastering of the essence of the
CFT, matrix elements involving even more complex forms of operators can be easily deduced from the
results obtained here.

4.1. Non-linear realization of the IS theory
The knowledge of the theoretical and experimental mass-dependence (MS) of selected atomic transi-
tions and the theoretical calculations of the volume effects (FS) gives the possibility to have a deter-
mination of the mean-square nuclear radii of short living isotopes [19]. Recent values for the nuclear
charge radii of short-lived lithium and helium isotopes have been obtained from measurements per-
formed at GSI, Vancouver [20], Argonne [21]. The measurements of the 22S1/2 → 32S1/2, of the
22S1/2 → 22P3/2, and 22S1/2 → 22P1/2 transitions together with the recently performed calcula-
tions [22] of the same transitions in lithium and helium atoms were in fact used to extract the difference

of the nuclear charge radii of the short-living isotopes from the charge radius of the stable isotope. In
this paper we propose to reevaluate the MS and the FS in a non perturbative approximation based on
the application of the eDCM.

We start to calculate the energies of the lithium atoms by diagonalizing Eq. (25) in a base formed
by three electrons in the (s,p,d) single particle states which interact with the BOV states formed by
exciting the e− − e+ continuum states. Results of this calculation for the 2s and 3s states are shown in
table I.

Table 6. Calculated energies of the 1s22s and the 1s23s in different models.

According to Ref. [19] in order to evaluate the Mass Shift (MS) we have to add to the eigenvalue
equation the additional term: ∇i.∇j and to rescale energies and distance with the reduced mass of the
electron. The matrix element of the ∇i.∇j can be calculated as in Ref. [13] while the rescaling of the
energies can be obtained by adding a ~Rnucl.~ri
electron term to Eqs. (23) and (24) and to re-diagonalize
the matrix given in Eq. (25). The correlations of the nucleus, which inﬂuence via the additional matrix
elements given above, are in general approximated by a non relativistic perturbative calculations [22].

The FS term [28] factorize into a constant

C =

[hδ~ri3s − hδ~ri2s]

2πZ

(26)

where the term hδ~ri denotes the expectation value of the electron density at the nucleus multiplied
by the isotopic variation of the charge radius. The polarizability of the nucleus, which inﬂuences the
calculation of this constant, has been evaluated relative to the polarization of deuterium [27]. Since the
FS is generally calculated in the point nucleus approximation, calculations performed within the DCM
(nucleus) and the eDCM (electrons) correlation models could give a better insight in the FS calculation.
Calculation of the IS for the isotopes of Lithium and Helium are under present calculation and will

be reported soon.

4.2. Transition energies in Lithium-like 235U.

The 2s-2p transition of Lithium-like 235U is calculated in the eDCM. The result is given in Table 7 and
compared with the QED calculation of Yerokhyn [29] and with the experimental result [30]. By using
the resulting eCMWFS for the 2s 1
we can calculate the hyperﬁne splitting (HF) of the two
states. The calculation are performed by coupling the three electron wave functions to the ground state
wave function of 235U. For the nuclear ground state wave function we use a DCM which reproduce
well within a large dimensional space the nuclear energies and moments of the 2f 7
2 valence neutron.
Detailed calculation will be reported soon.

5. Conclusion and Outlook

The transition energies of the Oxygen ions are calculated within a microscopic cluster model. The
model is derived from the unitary operator model eiS which is used to generate the eCMWFs. The
amplitudes of the model of the eCMWFs are calculated by using the EoM method. The modiﬁcations
caused to the energy transitions by a time dependent laser beam can be simply evaluated by modifying
the EoM. For few electron atoms like Helium and Lithium the EoM are extended to include the BOV
excitations (excitation of the positron-continuum). The calculated eCMWFs together with the nuclear
CMWFs of the different isotopes of Helium and Lithium allow a non-perturbative evaluation of the MS
and FS of the IS theory. The inﬂuence of this new evaluation method on the charge radii of the Helium
and Lithium isotopes is under present investigation. An open point in the presented calculation is the
determination of the error of the calculated transition energies. In performing structure calculations we
have used the single spinor energies obtained from the solution of the Dirac’s equation (see Eq. (1).
Better energies can be obtained by using the Harthee-Fock method. The approximation we have used
gives to the calculated energies an error that can vary depending from the electron energy considered
from 0.1 to few percent. A better estimation of the errors could however be given, as suggested by
Drake, by evaluating elementary excitation processes in light atoms like Hydrogen. For this purpose
we are investigating the two photon transitions in Hydrogen. This would allow to establish a connection
between the present non perturbative method and the QED perturbation theory.

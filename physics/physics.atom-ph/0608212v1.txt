We demonstrate a one-dimensional optical lattice clock with a spin-polarized fermionic

isotope designed to realize a collision-shift-free atomic clock with neutral atom ensembles.

To reduce systematic uncertainties, we developed both Zeeman shift and vector light-shift

cancellation techniques. By introducing both an H-maser and a Global Positioning System
(GPS) carrier phase link, the absolute frequency of the 1S0(F = 9/2)
3P0(F = 9/2) clock
transition of the 87Sr optical lattice clock is determined as 429,228,004,229,875(4) Hz, where
the uncertainty is mainly limited by that of the frequency link. The result indicates that the

−

Sr lattice clock will play an important role in the scope of the redeﬁnition of the “second”

by optical frequency standards.

Introduction

The rapid development of research on optical frequency measurement based on femtosec-
ond combs1), 2) has stimulated the ﬁeld of frequency metrology, especially research on high-

performance optical frequency standards. Optical frequency standards based on single trapped
ions3)–6) and ultracold neutral atoms in free fall7), 8) have provided record levels of performance

that approach those of the best Cs fountain clocks with a fractional frequency uncertainty of

below 1

We have proposed a novel approach named an “optical lattice clock”, in which atoms
trapped in an optical lattice potential serve as quantum references.10)–12) The sub-wavelength

localization of a single atom in each lattice site suppresses the ﬁrst-order Doppler-shift and

collisional-frequency-shift while it provides a long interrogation time of over 1 s. The light shift

induced by the trapping ﬁeld can be precisely canceled out by carefully tuning the lattice laser
wavelength to the “magic wavelength”.10), 11), 13)–15)

Recently, a higher order light shift, which is not canceled out at the “magic wavelength”

and that imposes an uncertainty limit on the lattice clock scheme, was observed in a Sr lattice
clock and revealed to aﬀect only the accuracy at a level below 10−18.16) Optical lattice clocks
have already achieved a linewidth that is one order of magnitude narrower12), 17) than that
observed for conventional neutral-atom optical clocks.7), 8) The very high potential stability

as well as accuracy of this scheme would permit the measurement of a fractional frequency
diﬀerence at the 10−18 level in a minute,11) which may open up new applications for ultra-
precise metrology, such as the search for the time variation of fundamental constants,4) the

real time monitoring of the gravitational frequency shift and the redeﬁnition of the “second”.

Until now, optical lattice clocks have only been demonstrated with one-dimensional (1D)
optical lattices employing spin-unpolarized fermions12), 15), 18), 19) or bosons.17) While these
experiments have clearly demonstrated the advantage of Lamb-Dicke conﬁnement20) provided

by an optical lattice, collisional-frequency shifts should exist because of the relatively high
atomic densities of up to 1011/cm3 trapped in a single lattice site.15), 21) This collision shift

would ultimately be a fatal accuracy problem for 1D optical lattice clocks as witnessed for
such neutral atom based clocks as Cs fountain clocks9) or Ca optical clocks,7), 8) in which

collision shifts dominate their uncertainty budgets. Even in the presence of other particles,
it has been predicted22) and demonstrated23), 24) in the RF transition that the collisional
frequency shifts can be suppressed through the Pauli exclusion principle25)–27) by employing

ultracold spin-polarized fermionic atoms.

In this paper, we demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, a 1D optical lattice clock with ultracold

spin-polarized fermionic atoms, which, in principle, would realize collisional-shift-free atomic

clocks. In addition, the Zeeman shift and the vector light shift cancellation technique have

been introduced to further improve the clock accuracy. Furthermore, an improved frequency

measurement based on an H-maser and a Global Positioning System (GPS) carrier phase link

is discussed in detail.

The absolute frequency of the transition for the Sr lattice clock was ﬁrst determined to
be 429,228,004,229,952(15) Hz using a Cs clock referenced to the SI second.12), 28) Later the
JILA group measured the frequency and found it to be 429,228,004,229,869(19) Hz.18) The

measurement results obtained by the two groups were in poor agreement at a level of three

times the combined uncertainties.

In order to resolve this inconsistency, we have improved the absolute frequency measure-

ments based on an H-maser linked to UTC (NMIJ) using GPS carrier phase signals. The UTC

(NMIJ) is in turn linked to international atomic time (TAI). The Allan standard deviation
10−15 at an averaging time of

is obtained for the Sr lattice clock and is found to reach 2

an uncertainty of 4 Hz. This frequency value diﬀers from that of our previous measurement

by ﬁve times the combined uncertainty but falls within the uncertainty of the JILA value.

We reported the preliminary results of our improved frequency measurement at CLEO/QELS
2006.29) Later we learned that the SYRTE group had also reported a measured frequency value
for the Sr lattice clock of 429,228,004,229,879(5) Hz on the arXiv19) during the CLEO/QELS

conference. There is good agreement between the measurement results obtained by the three

groups.

2. Method

2.1 Experimental setup

Figure 1 shows relevant energy levels for 87Sr atoms. Strontium atomic beams eﬀused from
1P1
an oven heated at 800 K were decelerated and magneto-optically trapped on the 1S0 −
transition at λ = 461 nm down to a few mK. The atoms were further cooled and trapped using
3P1 transition at λ =
the Dynamic Magneto-Optical Trapping (DMOT) scheme21) on the 1S0−
689 nm. Ultracold Sr atoms at a few µK were then loaded into a 1D optical lattice consisting
of a standing wave laser operated at the “magic wavelength” of λL = 813.428 nm.12), 16) The
lattice laser was focused into an e−2 beam radius of 30 µm. At the anti-node of the standing
wave a peak power density of IL =10 kW/cm2 was obtained, which gave axial and radial trap
frequencies of νx = 40 kHz and νy(

νz) = 350 Hz, respectively.

was installed. An acousto-optic modulator (AOM) operating at about 40 MHz was used for

both frequency control and intensity switching to produce an excitation π-pulse. The beam

waist of the clock laser was 300 µm to reduce intensity inhomogeneity.

2.2 Spectroscopy of trapped atoms

2.2.1 Spin polarization and cold collision suppression

In 1D optical lattice clocks, collisional frequency shifts should occur in each lattice site,

where typically a few tens of atoms were trapped, corresponding to an atomic density of
1011/cm3. Its suppression, therefore, is an important matter to be resolved if we are to realize

accurate atomic clocks.

In ultracold collisions, in general, the partial waves that contribute to the collisions are

0.8, as deduced by a

ﬁt in Fig. 4(a). In this measurement, the clock laser was tuned to the atomic resonance with
an intensity of 25 mW/cm2.

This dephasing of the Rabi oscillations can be suppressed by applying sideband cooling
to the axial motion and Doppler cooling to the radial motion,21) and by improving the beam

overlap between the clock and lattice lasers.

2.2.4 Frequency stabilization and Zeeman shift cancellation

Frequency stabilization34) of the clock laser to the spectrum center was realized by feedback

control of the AOM frequency (see Fig. 2) using the error signal ferr(tn) obtained by a digital

servo loop as,

ferr(tn+1) = ferr(tn) + δf (tn).

80 Hz is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) linewidth of the observed

spectrum, and κ(

excitation spectrum with respect to the stabilized line center at t = tn. In this servo loop,

the drift rate of the clock laser frequency was evaluated in advance and was fed forward

to minimize servo errors occurring during the frequency stabilization. We estimate that the

servo-error would be of the order of 0.1 Hz. The application of a second order integrator, in

addition to the currently used ﬁrst order integrator, will further reduce servo errors.

The measured spectrum was Zeeman shifted by a bias magnetic ﬁeld of B0. As depicted
in Fig. 1, the Zeeman splitting is smaller in the 3P0(F = 9/2) state than in the 1S0(F = 9/2)
state due to hyperﬁne mixing in the 3P0(F = 9/2) excited state. This introduces a ﬁrst order
106 Hz/G11) for the π-transition excited from the mF sublevel in the
Zeeman shift of mF ×
1S0(F = 9/2) ground state. This linear Zeeman shift can be eliminated by averaging the
two transition frequencies f±9/2, corresponding to the 1S0(F = 9/2, mF =

2.3 Frequency measurement

Full Paper

To measure the absolute frequency of the Sr lattice clock, a frequency comb system was

brought from NMIJ, AIST in Tsukuba to the University of Tokyo, where the optical lattice

clock was operated. Instead of the commercial Cs clock that was used as a local time base in
our previous frequency measurement,12), 28) we moved an H-maser (Kvarz, Model CH1-75A)

from Tsukuba to Tokyo to reduce the measurement uncertainty.

In the frequency comb, the frequency of the n-th comb component is expressed as

fn = n

frep + fCEO,

×

(8)

where frep is the repetition rate of the laser pulse and fCEO is the carrier-envelope oﬀset
frequency.2) When frep and fCEO are precisely controlled, the comb works as a “frequency
linker” that connects optical and radio frequencies. The control ports of frep and fCEO in the

Ti:sapphire laser are the lengths of the laser cavity and the pump laser power, respectively.
Our comb system is described in detail elsewhere.28), 35)

In this experimental conﬁguration, since the laser light after the AOM was a pulsed-light

used for the Sr spectroscopy, its frequency could not be directly measured with the frequency

comb. The frequency relations in the frequency measurement are shown in Fig. 2. We ﬁrst

measured the beat frequency fb =
of the comb fn with a photo-diode. We then electronically mixed the beat note fb with

between the clock laser fc and the n-th tooth

fAOM = ferr + 40 MHz with a double balanced mixer (DBM) and extracted the frequency

comb fn. In our measurement scheme, f ′
b was used to phase-lock the n-th comb component
to the Sr clock transition by feedback controlling the cavity length of the mode-locked laser.

In this way, the whole comb was locked to the Sr clock transition, which means that the

stability of each comb component and frep follows that of the Sr clock transition. frep was

measured against the H-maser as follows. frep was observed at about 793 MHz and down
converted to a frequency of f ′

ﬁlter. The frequency of 800 MHz was generated by using a synthesizer with a ﬁxed frequency
of exact 800 MHz. f ′

rep was measured and recorded with a universal counter (Agilent, Model
53132A). All the synthesizers and counters used in this experiment were phase locked to the

H-maser through a distribution ampliﬁer. Finally, fSr was calculated by using the equation:

fSr = n

where f ′

requiring n to be an integer, since we already know fSr with an uncertainty much smaller
than frep. The sign of f ′
b in eq. (10) was determined by changing frep slightly and observing
the variation of the f ′

b in the experiment.

To calibrate the frequency of the H-maser, GPS carrier phase receivers (Javad, Model

#Lexon-GGD) were employed at both sites, the University of Tokyo and NMIJ. In our previ-
ous measurement,12), 28) a GPS disciplined oscillator was introduced to link the local Cs clock
to the GPS time.36) To further improve the link precision, in the present experiment, the

H-maser was calibrated based on UTC (NMIJ) using the GPS carrier-phase technique with
the analysis software “GIPSY”.37) The distance between Tokyo and Tsukuba is about 51 km.

The relationship between the UTC (NMIJ) and TAI can be found in the monthly reports of
the Circular-T of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).38)

3. Experimental results

3.1 Stability evaluation of the lattice clock locked to the two Zeeman components

In order to evaluate the clock stability at optical frequencies, the optical lattice clock

was alternately stabilized to two Zeeman components, i.e., the 1S0(F = 9/2, mF =
3P0(F = 9/2, mF =
frequencies f±9/2, respectively. The duration of the clock excitation pulse was 10 ms, and a
nearly Fourier limited linewidth of 80 Hz was observed. Four successive measurements were

Error signals ferr that were fed back to the AOM (see Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 5(a) as a

function of elapsed time. The top and bottom curves correspond to the case when the clock

4.1 Frequency link

To reach the ﬁnal measurement result, systematic corrections were applied to the obtained

averaged frequencies. In the present measurement, the main correction is from the H-maser,

which was calibrated based on the UTC (NMIJ) using the GPS carrier-phase technique.

Figure 8(a) shows a typical recording of the time diﬀerence between the UTC (NMIJ) re-

alized in Tsukuba and the H-maser located at the University of Tokyo. The data was recorded

every 300 s over 2 days. The slope of the curve indicates the fractional frequency oﬀset between

to be mainly caused by the atmospheric ﬂuctuation along the link path. Figure 8(b) shows

4.2 A 1D optical lattice clock

The corrections and uncertainties for the Sr lattice clock are listed in Table II. Relatively

large corrections come from the blackbody radiation and the gravitational shifts. The black-
2.4 Hz39) for the temperature (T = 301 K) of
body radiation shift11), 39) is calculated to be

−
the vacuum chamber in which the optical lattice clock was operated. This temperature was

slightly higher than room temperature (T = 293 K) because of the heat generated by the

trapping coils. The uncertainty is estimated assuming the worst case of the chamber temper-

ature inhomogeneity of ∆T =

5 K. For the gravitational shift, the correction is calculated

using the height of the setup from the geoid surface (11 m) while the uncertainty is estimated

±

from the uncertainty of the height measurement (2 m).

As discussed previously, thanks to the application of spin-polarized ultracold fermions,

the collisional frequency shift can,

in principle, be eliminated. However,

imperfect spin-

polarization and inhomogeneous Rabi frequencies Ωn,n, which caused dephasing of Rabi os-

cillations among trapped atoms, might degrade the Fermi suppression, and introduce a colli-

sional frequency shift. In spite of this fact, no collisional frequency shift was detected within

the uncertainty of the present measurements.

The bias magnetic ﬁeld

= 1.78 G applied during the measurements caused a ﬁrst-

order Zeeman shift of

848 Hz for f±9/2, which was eliminated by alternately polarizing atoms

is estimated to be

0.736 Hz.

It is important to mention that this Zeeman shift cancellation scheme allows us to elim-

inate the vector light shift that occurs for an elliptically polarized lattice laser, which has

been regarded as one of the largest uncertainty sources in the error budgets in an optical
lattice clock.11) In the limit of the negligible mixing of Zeeman sublevels due to the light shift
perturbation, the vector light shift40) ǫv is described as the interaction between the eﬀective
magnetic ﬁeld δB, which is proportional to the degree of circular polarization of the lattice

laser and is parallel to the wave vector of the lattice laser kL, and the magnetic dipole operator

δB.

Therefore, the total magnetic ﬁeld can be written as B = B0 +δB. We note that in our present
conﬁguration δB is more than thousands times smaller than B0 and is nearly perpendicular
and B is assumed to be constant during

9/2 stretched states in the 1S0(F = 9/2) ground state as the clock
transition as demonstrated in this work, although they have the highest sensitivity for the
vector light shift.11)

As regards the tensor light shift, since we interrogated the 1S0(F = 9/2,

The error bars in Fig. 9 only include the GPS link uncertainties (listed in Table I) and

are given as one standard deviation. The weighted average of the ten measurements gives an

average frequency of 429,228,004,229,875.3 Hz. The standard deviation of the mean is 1.3 Hz.

However, we would like to point out that we have sometimes observed nonlinear variations in

the GPS link data, which may cause signiﬁcant errors in the determination of the correction

for the H-maser. These errors are included in the corrections for the H-maser but are not easily

averaged out. Therefore, we took the scatter of the data (the standard deviation) indicated

in Fig. 9, which is 3.8 Hz, as the uncertainty of the average frequency.

This uncertainty is then combined with all the other uncertainties listed in Table II and

the result gives the ﬁnal combined uncertainty as 4.2 Hz. To the best of our knowledge, this

is the lowest uncertainty reported for the determination of the absolute frequency of optical

lattice clocks.

In Fig. 10, in addition to the present measurement result, we also show the results from
the JILA18) and the SYRTE19) groups. The weighted average of the frequencies measured by

the three groups gives an average frequency of 429,228,004,229,876.6 Hz, which is within the

error bars of the three groups. The standard deviation of the mean is 3.2 Hz. There is good

agreement between the measurement results of the three groups. This is an important step

in research on an “optical lattice clock”, and promises to be a signiﬁcant contribution to the

ﬁeld of frequency metrology.

5. Discussion

The absolute frequency of the Sr lattice clock obtained with our improved frequency

measurement diﬀers from that of our previous measurement by ﬁve times the combined un-

certainty. It is diﬃcult to identify the origin of this diﬀerence since the measurement scheme

has been completely revised. The improved measurement approach has eliminated several

pitfalls as listed below.

(1) An H-maser was transported to the University of Tokyo, where the lattice clock was

operated, for use as a local time base in place of a commercial Cs atomic clock. The

short-term stability of the frequency measurement was improved by a factor of 50, which

is extremely useful when evaluating the measurement system. In some cases, the frequency

instability of the measurement system is related to the systematic errors. Unrevealed

systematic errors in the previous measurement system under the noise ﬂoor caused by the

instability of the commercial Cs atomic clock may be the main reason for the disagreement.

(2) A GPS carrier phase link is introduced to calibrate the H-maser through UTC (NMIJ).

This link has reduced the uncertainty of the local clock calibration signiﬁcantly compared
with the GPS disciplined oscillator used in our previous measurement.28)

(3) The clock laser is stabilized to the lattice clock transition in the present experiment. This

has eliminated the detrimental eﬀects that arise from the timing synchronization and the

interpolation in the data treatment for spectroscopy and frequency measurement.

(4) Some elements in the frequency measurement system, including the distribution ampliﬁer,

have been replaced to reduce measurement instability.

The whole experiment involves complicated equipment that needs to be transported from

one place to another. This has prevented the continuous experiments that are needed to trace

the main improvement of the system step by step. This situation will be improved in future

by comparing multiple optical lattice clocks at the University of Tokyo or by measuring an

optical lattice clock at the NMIJ.

To further reduce the measurement uncertainty, we must reinforce the frequency link be-

tween the University of Tokyo and the NMIJ in Tsukuba. An optical ﬁber network that delivers
optical and microwave frequencies is an eﬀective method for high-precision time transfer.41)

In terms of a direct link to TAI, a two-way satellite comparison between Japan and Europe

using the carrier-phase technique is valuable in reducing the uncertainty of the time transfer.

Of course, a transportable Cs fountain clock should allow us direct access to a highly accurate

realization of the deﬁnition of the second at the local site.

As for the optical lattice clock, the averaging of the two Zeeman components has signiﬁ-

cantly reduced systematic uncertainties originating from the Zeeman shift and the vector light

shift. Although we have employed a spin polarized ultracold fermionic isotope for the clock

experiment, we found that the inhomogeneous Rabi frequencies among trapped atoms, which

caused the dephasing of Rabi oscillations, degraded the clock signal intensity and presumably

the collision suppression due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This problem can be solved by

reducing the Lamb-Dicke parameters, which can be accomplished by further cooling atoms to
recoil temperatures or the vibrational ground state, as we have demonstrated.21) Of course, the
application of 3D optical lattice clocks as in the original proposal10) would completely resolve

these issues related to inhomogeneous Rabi frequencies and collisional frequency shifts.

6. Conclusion

We have demonstrated a one-dimensional optical

lattice clock with a spin-polarized

fermionic isotope, which will, in principle, realize a collision-shift-free atomic clock with neu-

tral atom ensembles. To reduce systematic uncertainties, we have developed Zeeman shift and

vector light-shift cancellation techniques. By introducing both an H-maser and a Global Posi-
3P0(F =
tioning System (GPS) carrier phase link, the absolute frequency of the 1S0(F = 9/2)
9/2) clock transition of the 87Sr lattice clock is determined as 429,228,004,229,875(4) Hz. To

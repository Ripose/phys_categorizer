We study the trap depth requirement for the realization of an optical clock using atoms conﬁned
in a lattice. We show that site-to-site tunnelling leads to a residual sensitivity to the atom dynamics
hence requiring large depths (50 to 100 Er for Sr) to avoid any frequency shift or line broadening
of the atomic transition at the 10−17 − 10−18 level. Such large depths and the corresponding
laser power may, however, lead to diﬃculties (e.g. higher order light shifts, two-photon ionization,
technical diﬃculties) and therefore one would like to operate the clock in much shallower traps.
To circumvent this problem we propose the use of an accelerated lattice. Acceleration lifts the
degeneracy between adjacents potential wells which strongly inhibits tunnelling. We show that
using the Earth’s gravity, much shallower traps (down to 5 Er for Sr) can be used for the same
accuracy goal.

INTRODUCTION

The control of the external degrees of

freedom of
atoms,
ions and molecules and of the associated fre-
quency shifts and line broadenings is a long standing issue
of the ﬁelds of spectroscopy and atomic frequency stan-
dards. They have been a strong motivation for the devel-
opment of many widely spread techniques like the use of
buﬀer gases [1], Ramsey spectroscopy [2], saturated spec-
troscopy [3], two-photon spectroscopy [4], trapping and
laser cooling [5, 6], etc.

×

In the case of ions, the problem is now essentially
solved since they can be trapped in relatively low ﬁelds
and cooled to the zero point of motion of such traps [5].
In this state, the ions are well within the Lamb-Dicke
regime [1] and experience no recoil nor ﬁrst order Doppler
eﬀect [5]. The fractional accuracy of today’s best ion
10−15 [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
clocks lies in the range from 3 to 10
with still room for improvement. The main drawback of
trapped ion frequency standards is that only one to a few
ions can contribute to the signal due to Coulomb repul-
sion. This fundamentally limits the frequency stability of
these systems and puts stringent constraints on the fre-
quency noise of the oscillator which probes the ions [12].
These constraints are relaxed when using a large num-
ber of neutral atoms [13] for which, however, trapping re-
quires much higher ﬁelds, leading to shifts of the atomic
levels. This fact has for a long time prevented the use
of trapped atoms for the realization of atomic clocks and
today’s most accurate standards use freely falling atoms.
Microwave fountains now have an accuracy slightly be-
low 10−15 and are coming close to their foreseen ultimate

limit which lies around 10−16 [14], which is essentially not
related to eﬀects due to the atomic dynamics [15, 16]. In
the optical domain, atomic motion is a problem and even
with the use of ultra-cold atoms probed in a Ramsey-
Bord´e interferometer [17], optical clocks with neutrals
still suﬀer from the ﬁrst order Doppler and recoil ef-
fects [18, 19, 20, 21]. Their state-of-the-art accuracy is
about 10−14 [20].

The situation has recently changed with the proposal
of the optical lattice clock [22]. The idea is to engineer
a lattice of optical traps in such a way that the dipole
potential is exactly identical for both states of the clock
transition, independently of the dipole laser power and
polarisation. This is achieved by tuning the trap laser
to the so-called ”magic wavelength” and by the choice
of clock levels with zero electronic angular momentum.
The original scheme was proposed for 87Sr atoms using
3 P0 line at 698 nm as a clock
the strongly forbidden 1S0 −
transition [23]. In principle however, it also works for all
atoms with a similar level structure like Mg, Ca, Yb, Hg,
etc.
including their bosonic isotopes if one uses multi-
photon excitation of the clock transition [24, 25].

In this paper we study the eﬀect of the atom dynamics
in the lattice on the clock performances. In ref. [22], it is
implicitly assumed that each microtrap can be treated
separately as a quadratic potential in which case the
situation is very similar to the trapped ion case and
then fully understood [5]. With an accuracy goal in the
10−17
10−18 range in mind (corresponding to the mHz
level in the optical domain), we shall see later on, that
this is correct at very high trap depths only. The natu-
ral energy unit for the trap dynamics is the recoil energy
associated with the absorption or emission of a photon
of the lattice laser, Er =
with kL the wave vec-
tor of the lattice laser and ma the atomic mass. For
Sr and for the above accuracy goal the trap depth U0

U0 = 100 Er, which corresponds to a peak laser intensity
of 25 kW/cm2.

II. CONFINED ATOMS COUPLED TO A
LIGHT FIELD

For a number of reasons however, one would like to
work with traps as shallow as possible. First, the resid-
ual shift by the trapping light of the clock transition is
smaller and smaller at a decreasing trap depth. The ﬁrst
order perturbation is intrinsically cancelled by tuning to
the magic wavelength except for a small eventual tenso-
rial eﬀect which depends on the hyperﬁne structure of
the atom under consideration. Higher order terms may
be much more problematic depending on possible coin-
cidences between two photon resonances and the magic
wavelength [22, 26]. The associated shift scales as U 2
0 [47].
The shifts would then be minimized by a reduction of
U0 and its evaluation would be greatly improved if one
can vary this parameter over a broader range. Second,
for some of the possible candidate atoms, such as Hg for
which the magic wavelength is about 340 nm, two-photon
ionization can occur which may limit the achievable reso-
nance width and lead to a frequency shift. Finally, tech-
nical aspects like the required laser power at the magic
wavelength can be greatly relaxed if one can use shallow
traps. This can make the experiment feasible or not if the
magic wavelength is in a region of the spectrum where no
readily available high power laser exists, such as in the
case of Hg. For this atom, a trap depth of 100 Er would
necessitate a peak intensity of 500 kW/cm2 at 340 nm.

When considering shallow traps, the independent trap
limit no longer holds, and one cannot neglect tunnelling
of the atoms from one site of the lattice to another. This
leads to a delocalization of the atoms and to a band struc-
ture in their energy spectrum and associated dynamics.
In section III we investigate the ultimate performance of
the clock taking this eﬀect into account. We show that
depending on the initial state of the atoms in the lattice,
one faces a broadening and/or a shift of the atomic tran-
sition of the order of the width of the lowest energy band
of the system. For Sr, this requires U0 of the order of
100 Er to ensure a fractional accuracy better than 10−17.

The deep reason for such a large required value of U0
is that site-to-site tunnelling is a resonant process in a
lattice. We show in section IV that a much lower U0
can be used provided the tunnelling process is made non-
resonant by lifting the degeneracy between adjacent sites.
This can be done by adding a constant acceleration to the
lattice, leading to the well-known Wannier-Stark ladder
of states [27, 28]. More speciﬁcally, we study the case
where this acceleration is simply the Earth’s gravity. The
experimental realization of the scheme in this case is then
extremely simple: the atoms have to be probed with a
laser beam which propagates vertically. In this conﬁgu-
5 Er can be suﬃcient
ration, trap depths down to U0 ∼
for the above accuracy goal.

In this section we describe the theoretical frame used
to investigate the residual eﬀects of the motion of atoms
in an external potential. The internal atomic structure

A. Eigenstates and coupling by the probe laser

We now consider the case of atoms trapped in an op-
tical lattice. As is clear from eq. (5), only the motion of
the atoms along the probe laser propagation axis plays a
role in the problem and we restrict the analysis to 1D[48].
We assume that the lattice is formed by a standing wave
leading to the following external hamiltonian:

from the Bloch theorem [29]. They are labelled by two
quantum numbers:
the band index n and the quasi-
momentum q. Furthermore they are periodic functions of
q with period 2kl and the usual convention is to restrict
oneself to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone q

Following a procedure given in Ref. [28] a numerical
solution to this eigenvalue problem can be easily found
in the momentum representation. The atomic plane wave

FIG. 6: Expected resonances in the case where the ﬁrst
band is uniformely populated for Ω = 10 Hz and U0 =
20 Er, 30 Er, 40 Er, and 100 Er. The duration of the inter-
action is such that the transition probability at resonance is
maximized.

Another extreme situation is the case where one band
is uniformly populated. In this case the ”carrier” shift
averaged over q cancels and one can hope to operate
the clock at a much lower U0 than in the previous case.
The problem is then the ultimate linewidth that can be
achieved in the system, which is of the order of the width
of the band and is reminiscent of Doppler broadening.
This is illustrated in ﬁgure 6 for which we have computed
the expected ”carrier” resonances in the case where the
lowest band is uniformly populated, by numerically solv-
ing equations (5). This was done for a Rabi frequency
Ω = 10 Hz and an interaction duration which is adjusted
for each trapping depth so as to maximize the transition
probability at zero detuning. We have checked that all
resonances plotted in ﬁgure 6 are not shifted to within
the numerical accuracy (less than 10−5 Hz). However,
at decreasing U0 the contrast of the resonance starts to
drop for U0 < 40 Er and the resonance broadens progres-
sively, becoming unusable for precise spectroscopy when
the width of the energy band reaches the Rabi frequency.
To get more physical insight into this phenomenon, let’s
consider the particular example of this uniform band pop-
ulation where one well of the lattice is initially populated.
This corresponds to a given relative phase of the Bloch
states such that the interference of the Bloch vectors is
destructive everywhere except in one well of the lattice.
The time scale for the evolution of this relative phase is
the inverse of the width of the populated energy band
which then corresponds to the tunnelling time towards
delocalization (once the relative phases have evolved sig-
niﬁcantly, the destructive/constructive interferences of
the initial state no longer hold). The broadening and loss
of contrast shown in ﬁgure 6 can be seen as the Doppler
eﬀect associated with this tunnelling motion.
The two cases discussed above (pure

state
and uniform superposition of all states inside a band:
) correspond to the two extremes one can ob-
i
tain when populating only the bottom band. They illus-

trate the dilemma one has to face: either the resonance
is aﬀected by a frequency shift of the order of the width
of the bottom band (pure state), or by a braoadening of

−
asymptotically decreases as U −|n
for the beneﬁt of
the ”carrier” (n′ = n). The frequency separation of the
resonances rapidly increases with U0 (Fig. 4). For U0 as
low as 5 Er, this separation is of the order of 10 kHz. For
narrow resonances (which are required for an accurate
clock) they can be treated separately and the eﬀect of
the sidebands on the carrier is negligible. If for example
one reaches a carrier width of 10 Hz, the sideband pulling
is of the order of 10−5 Hz. On the other hand, the ”car-
rier” frequency is shifted from the atomic frequency by
ωI
n,q due to the band structure. This shift is of
the order of the width of the nth band (Fig. 5 and 3).
It can be seen as a residual Doppler and recoil eﬀect for
atoms trapped in a lattice and is a consequence of the
complete delocalisation of the eigenstates of the system
over the lattice. The ”carrier” shift is plotted in ﬁgure 5
for the case n = 0 and U0 = 10 Er. For this shift to be as
small as 5 mHz over the whole lowest band, which corre-
sponds in fractional units to 10−17 for Sr atoms probed
3 P0 transition, the lattice depth should be
on the 1S0 −
at least 90 Er (Fig. 3).

of the lattice. As is well-known from solid-state physics,
one way to localize the atoms is to add a linear com-
ponent to the Hamiltonian [27]: adjacent wells are then
shifted in energy, which strongly inhibits tunnelling. In
this section we study the case where the lattice and probe
laser are oriented vertically so that gravity plays the role
of this linear component. The external hamiltonian is

with g the acceleration of the Earth’s gravity. This hamil-
tonian supports no true bound states, as an atom initially
conﬁned in one well of the lattice will end up in the con-
tinuum due to tunnelling under the inﬂuence of gravity
(Fig. 7). This eﬀect is known as Landau-Zener tun-
nelling and can be seen as non-adiabatic transitions be-
tween bands induced by the linear potential in the Bloch
representation [31, 32, 33, 34]. The timescale for this ef-
fect however increases exponentially with the depth of the
lattice and for the cases considered here is orders of mag-
nitude longer than the duration of the experiment [49]. In
the case of Sr in an optical lattice, and for U0 as low as
5 Er, the lifetime of the ground state of each well is about
1010 s! The coupling due to gravity between the ground
and excited bands can therefore be neglected here.
In
the frame of this approximation the problem of ﬁnding
the ”eigenstates” of ˆH II
ext reduces to its diagonalization
in a sub-space restricted to the ground band [35, 36] (we
drop the band index in the following to keep notations as
simple as possible). We are looking for solutions to the

In the experimental setup described in [30] about 90 %
of the atoms are in the lowest band and can be selected
by an adequate sequence of laser pulses. The residual
population of excited bands can then be made negligible
(< 10−3). On the other hand, knowing and controlling
with accuracy the population of the various
states in
the ground band is a diﬃcult task. The actual initial
distribution of atomic states will lie somewhere between
a pure state in the bottom band and a uniform super-
position of all states in the bottom band. If we assume
that the population of the
states in the ground band

can be controlled so that the frequency shift averages to
within one tenth of the band width, then a fractional ac-
curacy goal of 10−17 implies U0 = 70 Er or more. Note
that due to the exponential dependence of the width of
the ground band on U0 (see ﬁgure 3) the required lat-
tice depth is largely insensitive to an improvement in the
control of the initial state. If for example the averaging
eﬀect is improved down to 1 % the depth requirement
drops from 70 Er to 50 Er. Consequently, operation of
an optical lattice clock requires relatively deep wells and
correspondingly high laser power, which, in turn, is likely
to lead to other diﬃculties as described in the introduc-
tion.

Fortunately, the requirement of deep wells can be sig-
niﬁcantly relaxed by adding a constant acceleration to
the lattice, as described in the next section.

section are both due to site-to-site tunnelling and to the
corresponding complete delocalization of the eigenstates

ponentially at increasing lattice depth. At U0 = 10 Er
the ﬁrst revival is already a hundred times smaller than
the main peak. Conversely, in the momentum repre-
sentation, the distribution gets broader with increasing
U0. The phase shift between bm and bm−1 in (13),
bm(q) = e−iπq/kl bm−1(q), corresponds to a translational
symmetry of the Wannier-Stark states in the position

B. Discussion

We now study the case where the initial state of the
atom is a pure Wannier-Stark state. According to eq.
(17) excitation by the laser will lead to a set of reso-
nances separated by ∆g (see Fig. 9). In the case of Sr,
∆g/2π = 866 Hz and for the narrow resonances required
for high performance clock operation, they are easily re-
solved. The resonances obtained by ﬁrst numerically in-

tegrating (14) and then numerically solving (17) are plot-

They exhibit remarkable properties. First the ”carrier”
(which corresponds to the transition
) has
a frequency which exactly matches the atomic frequency
ωeg. It also doesn’t suﬀer from any broadening or con-
trast limitation (provided the side bands are resolved)
which would be due to the atomic dynamics. Second, the
sidebands (
) have a coupling strength
|
which very rapidly decreases as U0 increases (see ﬁg. 11).
In addition they are fully symmetric with respect to the
carrier which results from eq. (16), and hence lead to no
line pulling of the carrier. We have checked that the nu-
merical calculations agree with this statement to within
the accuracy of the calculations. This absence of shift
and broadening remains true even for very shallow traps
down to a depth of a few Er, the ultimate limitation
being the lifetime of the Wannier-Stark states. This sit-
uation is in striking contrast with the results of section
III in the absence of gravity.

The system is more complex if the initial state of the
atom is a coherent superposition of neighbouring wells.

Modulation depth [

FIG. 13: Frequency shift of the carrier as a function of the
square modulation depth (see caption of Fig. 12). The cal-
culation has been performed for U0 = 5 Er, Ω0/2π = 10 Hz
and an interaction time of t∆g/2π = 43.5. The initial atomic
state is the one corresponding to the dotted line in ﬁgure 12.

×

In this case oﬀ-resonant excitation of the sidebands will
interfere with the carrier excitation with a relative phase
which depends on the initial relative phase of neighbour-
ing wells and on all the parameters of the atom-laser
interaction (Ω, ω and the duration of the interaction).
This interference leads to a modiﬁcation of the carrier
transition probability which is of the order of Ω1/∆g
(for the ﬁrst, and most signiﬁcant, sideband). For an
interaction close to a π pulse, an order of magnitude of
the corresponding carrier pulling is then Ω1Ω0/∆g which
can be signiﬁcant. As an example for U0 = 10 Er and
10−2 Hz, i.e. sev-
Ω0/2π = 10 Hz the shift is about 2
eral times 10−17 of the clock transition frequency. This
shift is a priori all the more problematic as the initial
atomic state is diﬃcult to know and control accurately.
We have numerically solved eq. (17) for various initial
atomic states, lattice depths and interaction parameters
to get a more quantitative insight of the eﬀect. The re-
sults are illustrated in ﬁgure 12 for the case U0 = 5 Er.
A clear signature of the eﬀect can be identiﬁed from its
dependence on the interaction duration: the frequency
shift oscillates with a frequency ∆g/2π resulting from
the ∆g term in ∆m−m′ in (17). This provides a power-
ful method for investigating site-to-site coherences in the
lattice. More interestingly from a clock point of view,
the shift becomes negligible for all interaction durations
t such that t = (n + 1/2)2π/∆g. For these interaction
durations the interference from the sidebands is symmet-
ric for positive and negative detunings from resonance,
leading to no overall shift. Since ∆g is extremely well
known (potentially at the 10−9 level) this condition can
be accurately met. Note that choosing such a value
of the interaction duration does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the contrast, as the two relevant timescales have diﬀer-
ent orders of magnitude in the narrow resonance limit
(Ω−1 >> ∆−1
g ), and therefore a range of values of t such
that t = (n + 1/2)2π/∆g correspond to almost optimal
contrast (e.g. all such values of t in ﬁgure 12). A more
detailed study shows that the level of cancellation de-
pends on the depth of the modulation used to determine
the frequency shift (see caption of Fig. 12) which results
from a slight distortion of the carrier resonance. This

eﬀect is shown in ﬁgure 13, which clearly indicates that
the shift can be controlled to below 1 mHz even for a
very shallow lattice depth down to U0 = 5 Er.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

−

−

We studied the trap depth requirement for the opera-
tion of an optical lattice clock with a projected fractional
accuracy in the 10−17
10−18 range. We have shown that
using a purely periodic potential necessitates a lattice of
depth 50
100 Er limited by tunnelling between adjacent
sites of the lattice. A possible way to vastly reduce this
depth is to use gravity to lift the degeneracy between the
potential wells which strongly inhibits tunnelling. Trap
10 Er are then suﬃcient to cancel
depths down to 5
the eﬀects of the atom dynamics at the desired accuracy
level. This will become even more important for future
work aiming at even higher accuracies. Although very
simple, gravity is not the only way to suppress tunnelling
and other solutions, essentially consisting in a dynamic
control of the lattice, are certainly possible [38, 39, 40].
They may prove useful if one wants to operate a lattice
clock in space for instance.

Throughout the paper we have not taken into account
the dynamics of the atoms in the directions transverse
to the probe beam propagation. Experimental imperfec-
tions however (misalignement, wavefront curvature, aber-
rations) may lead to a residual sensitivity to this dynam-

8

ics.
If for example the probe beam is misaligned with
respect to the vertical lattice by 100 µrad the transverse
wavevector k⊥ is about 10−4 ks and a modest transverse
conﬁnement should be suﬃcient to make its eﬀect negligi-
ble. Such a conﬁnement can be provided by the gaussian
transverse shape of the laser forming the lattice or by a
3D lattice. The latter also leads to an interesting physi-
cal problem depending on the relative orientation of the
lattice with respect to gravity [41].

Finally the well-deﬁned energy separation between
Wannier-Stark states and the possibility to drive tran-
sitions between them on the red or blue sideband of
the spectrum (section IV B) opens new possibilities for
the realization of atom interferometers. This provides a
method to generate a coherent superposition of distant
states for the accurate measurement of the energy sepa-
ration between these states. This can for instance lead to
an alternative determination of g or h/ma [42, 43, 44, 45].

[47] note that this eﬀect cannot be quantiﬁed without an ac-
curate knowledge of the magic wavelength and of the
strength of transitions involving highly excited states.
[48] See section V for a brief discussion of the 3D problem
[49] This exponential increase is true on average only and
can be modiﬁed for speciﬁc values of U0 by a resonant
coupling between states in distant wells [34, 37, 46].
[50] For similar reasons as in section III one can neglect
the coupling to excited bands in the system for narrow
enough resonances.

We study numerically collisions between protons and H +

2 molecular ions at intermediate impact
energies by using the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo method (CTMC). Total and diﬀerential cross
sections are computed. The results are compared with: a) the standard one electron–two nucleon
scattering, and b) the quantum mechanical treatment of the H +

2 scattering.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ion–atom collisions represent one of the main ﬁelds of research in atomic physics, both experi-
mental and theoretical. Currently, there is a great deal of studies about the collisions with electron
transfer between ions and oriented atoms (i.e. with a preferred sense of circulation of the electron
around the nucleus) and also between ions and aligned atoms (where the probability distribution of
the electron is not spherical). The interest has been triggered by the development of experimental
techniques which allow to prepare atoms in well deﬁned states of low [1] or high quantum numbers
(n, l, m) [2] and, after scattering, to measure the ﬁnal state of the system [3]. The very narrow phase
space volume sampled by the electron allows a detailed study of the physical mechanisms occurring
during the impact, which would not be otherwise transparent due to the averaging over the entire
space of electronic conﬁgurations. Consequences of ﬁrst order eﬀects–spatial overlap and velocity
matching–have been extensively studied with the above mentioned techniques, interpreted in the
light of classical mechanics [4,5] and sometimes compared with exact quantum calculations [6,7]. A
recent brief review about the latest developments in this ﬁeld is given by Schippers [8], and some
even more recent experimental and theoretical works can be found in [9].
Less attention has been paid to processes which involve more than one target nucleus: some studies
of collisions between H2 and bare ions are reported, for example, in [8,10–13], and the scattering
H +–H +
Calculations on these systems using quantum mechanics is far from being straightforward. By con-
trast, the application of classical methods, and in particular of the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo
method (CTMC) presents several advantages: The numerical complications introduced by solving
the equations of motion for a few more particles are negligible. One may think, in comparison, to
the problems which arise when attempting of solving the Schr¨odinger equation for three particles
instead of two.
Since the original work of Abrines and Percival [15] the CTMC method has been one of the most
successful techniques for studying the scattering between heavy charged particles at intermediate
impact energies. Starting from the simple H–H + processes and from the calculation of simple total
cross sections, the method has been reﬁned so that nowadays it gives many detailed informations:
Diﬀerential cross sections [16], which are ordinarily measured in experiments, and state–to–state
transitions [17], which are especially useful for the research and development on thermonuclear fu-
sion. The CTMC method has also been applied to more complex systems: Collisions involving more

than an electron [18], requiring the inter-electronic correlation, have been, and still are [16,19], a
great challenge.

To our knowledge, until now CTMC has not been applied to polynuclear targets: In this work we
do an investigation on this kind of process using the simplest target, the H +
2 molecular ion. We aim
to understand how and to which degree the complex structure of the target modiﬁes the results of
the scattering with respect to the standard two nucleons–one electron case.
In presence of a diatomic target the question of interference between the two scattering centres raises,

the results due to the presence of a second target is likely to be expected.

The ﬁrst problem one has to face is to obtain an equilibrium electron distribution function for
2 molecular ion. In Section II it is described how this has been dealt with in this work.
The results of the numerical simulations, expressed in the form of cross sections, are compared
with the similar results for two nucleons scattering, and the diﬀerences are examined in Section III.

II. THEORY

In any CTMC calculation an important role is played by the choice of the initial conditions of
the electron in the phase space. It is well known that, in the case of the ground state of hydrogen,
E1s)/8π3, yields
extracting electron coordinates from a microcanonical distribution, f (r, p) = δ(E
the correct quantum mechanical momentum distribution [19]:

where E1s =
0.5 au (atomic units will be used unless otherwise stated), and N the normalization
factor. Obviously this relations holds also for hydrogen–like ions. On the other hand, the radial
distribution is not reproduced satisfactorily. While no classical method can reproduce at the same
time both the exact momentum and spatial distribution, some methods have been devised which
allow to exactly reproduce the latter distribution at the expenses of the former (so called CTMC-r
method, opposed to the CTMC-p method–see [20] ), or to yield an approximate–but rather good–
description of both distributions (for more about the subject see the references quoted in [16] or
[21]).
In this work we have approximated the quantum mechanical electron wave function by a
Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals:

ψ(r) =

where A and B refer to the two protons which are placed initially with null velocity along the z axis,
z0 from the origin, with z0 kept equal to 1 au, in accordance with the true equilibrium

internuclear distance. With this choice the molecule has a cylindrical symmetry with respect to the
z axis. From a Fourier transform of Eq. (2) we get the momentum distribution function: since

where r0 = (0, 0, z0), we obtain

φ does not explicitly appear in Eq. (6) and may be chosen uniformly in the interval (0, 2π).
The chosen distribution is not expected to be a stationary one for the classical system, so it is of
interest to see how much it varies with time. In Figure 1 we plotted the contour of the distributions
˜̺(pz, pr) ̺(z, r) at t = 0 and t = 5, in absence of the projectile, from which one may see that the
diﬀerence is not small but the essential features still remain so the choice of this distribution appears
to be justiﬁed.

−

The projectile initial parameters are the velocity v, the impact parameter b with respect of the
centre of mass O of the molecule, the azimuthal angle ϑ with respect to the molecule axis, and the
initial distance d from O. A sketch of the scattering conﬁguration for the coplanar case (all the
nuclei lying on the same plane) is shown in Figure 2. The projectile is then rotated out of the plane
by a random angle between 0 and 2π.

After having initialized all the four particles, the corresponding equations of the motions are
numerically integrated in time until the nucleons are well far apart. In the computations d is not
a critical parameter as far as it is great enough to allow the target molecule and the projectile to
be considered initially as non–interacting. After some trials a value of d
20 au was found to be
reasonable. With given values for b, v and ϑ, a number N of runs have been carried on, varying
only the electron initial conditions. At the end of each collision one may ﬁnd one of the following
situations: 1) the original molecule remains intact; 2) it may be dissociated but the electron is
still bound to one of the two nuclei; 3) the electron is bound to the projectile (we call this case
”charge transfer”); 4) the molecule may be broken and the electron be ionized. Each process i (with
i = 1, 2, 3, 4) happens Ni times over the total N runs, with corresponding probabilities

This latter integral has been evaluated by a simple trapezoidal rule using the values ϑk (k=1,...,n)

The presence of a second nucleus is clearly seen when one plots σ versus ϑ (Figure 3). One can
see an increasing trend with ϑ, i.e. electron capture is favoured when the projectile impinges with
a direction perpendicular to the molecule axis. ϑ plays here the same role of the angle φ between
the angular momentum of an aligned electron and the projectile direction in ion–atom collisions
(see, for example, Figure 1 of Ref. [7]): with this parallelism in mind, the data may be compared

3

with similar plots, for example, in [5,7,22]. In comparison with those cases the eﬀect is here much
less marked, due to the fact that the electron probability distribution is smeared over a broader
phase space volume. Nevertheless it seems possible to give at least a qualitative explanation of the
trends in Figure 3 using propensity rules. As already explained in Section II one ﬁnds that, for a
given value of the momentum p, the maximum of the probability of ﬁnding a matching between
the velocities of the electron and the projectile is when pz = 0 and–as pz = p cos (ϑ)–this means
ϑ = π/2 (see also Figure 1, where the electron distribution is localized close to pz = 0). σ(ϑ = 90◦)

for the scattering H +–H2 at high velocities (
1 MeV), within the Brinkman–Kramers formalism.
There is discernible (see their Figure 6) a ﬂuctuation, attributed to interference eﬀects, which does
not appear in our data (this was to be expected since, obviously, purely quantum mechanical eﬀects
cannot be included in our model). The same eﬀect, even enhanced, is experimentally found in [12].

One way of looking at these data is plotting the anisotropy parameter

versus v (Figure 4). σcx is σi from Eq. (10) corresponding to the process of electron capture. A is
oscillating but deﬁnitely assumes negative value, approaching zero while v increases. A < 0 means
that capture is favoured when the projectile and the molecular alignment are orthogonal. This is
in agreement with other works (see, for example, the paper by Thomsen et al or that of Olson and
Hoekstra in ref. [9]) where, furthermore, a more complex behaviour is also found, with changes of
sign of A.

In Figure 5(a) total cross sections (the same data of Figure 3, averaged over angle ϑ) are shown as
functions of impact velocity v. These data lend themselves to a comparison with structureless target
scattering: in Janev [23] it is empirically demonstrated how nucleus–hydrogen scattering follows a
scaling law: the curve σcx/n4Z versus v2n2/Z0.5 is universal, regardless of the initial principal
quantum number n of the electron and of the charge Z of the nucleus. We may imagine to replace
the diatomic molecule with a single particle, to which the electron is bound in a state deﬁned by an
eﬀective (non integer) quantum number nef f = 1/
0.67 with our values. The agreement

between our rescaled data and the universal curve by Janev yields an estimate of how much this
modelling is justiﬁed. From Figure 5(b) one sees that the qualitative trend is the same, and the
data are quite well interpolated by the ﬁt in the middle of the range v:
it is expected that, with
increasing v, the electron–ion collisions closer and closer resemble two body processes, with a lesser
inﬂuence of the target nucleus. In this situation the distribution function should not have inﬂuence.
At the lower v’s, the suggested ﬁt underestimates the data; however, it is diﬃcult to discerne how
much of this discrepancy is due to the structure of the target and how much to the intrinsic defects
of the CTMC method in this region of low energy.

In order to have a further insight about the reliability of our results, we have compared them with
in ref. [14] a calculation similar to ours has
previous calculations performed with other methods:
been carried on in the impact energy range from 100 keV to 5 MeV (2
14) using a distorted-
wave model under diﬀerent approximations: the simpler OBK approximation and the more reﬁned
correct-boundary-conditions Born serie (B1B) and the ﬁrst order Bates series (Ba1) (see [14] and
references therein for more details about these approximations). Figure 4 of ref. [14] shows the
diﬀerential cross section for electron capture dσ/d(cos ϑ) as a function of ϑ at a collision energy of
100 keV for H +–H +
2 collisions. We have integrated the curves plotted and the results are shown
in Figure 5(a). From this one may see that the accuracy of our calculation (at least for the single
energy point available) is of the same order as the OBK approximation, and therefore overestimates
the correct value, which should be close to that given by the B1B and Ba1 methods (which better
ﬁt the Janev’ scaling law).

≤

≤

v

Up to now, only ˜̺(p) has been taken into account to justify the results, so it is interesting
to study the eﬀects due to the spatial distribution ̺(r). Looking at the diﬀerential cross section
P (b)b for various impact energies and azimuthal angles, we noticed that the increase of σ
dσ/db
with ϑ is due to the contribution from larger b’s. This agrees with the results of [11].

∝

Finally, some words about the ﬁnal state distribution. In our system about 80

90% of the total
captures occur in the ground state. This is easily justiﬁed because the electron prefers to preserve
its energy before and after the capture. A detailed study, looking for example at a dependence of
this distribution from azimuthal angle or energy, would need a much larger amount of data, beyond
the possibilities of the present study.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A series of numerical simulations has been performed on the charge–transfer collisions between
protons and hydrogen molecular ions using classical methods. The interest of the subject relies on the
comparison between this system and other, well studied, three-particle systems. Some conclusions
which may be drawn from this study are: I) The CTMC method applied to this target is able to
discerne its structure–as is seen from diﬀerential cross sections–but, with respect to quantal methods,
its sensitivity is greatly reduced, as may be seen from the fact that no ﬂuctuations due to interference
eﬀects are seen; II) Besides partial cross sections, also total cross sections seem to depend on the
structure of the target, but this point is more diﬃcult to stress since main diﬀerences appear at
small v’s, where CTMC is less reliable; III) The accuracy of the CTMC has been compared with
quantal methods in the region of high v, limiting to total cross sections. It is found that–within the
very small data set–the predictions of the CTMC well agree with those of the less reﬁned versions
of the quantum mechanical calculations, and slightly overestimate the more reﬁned ones.

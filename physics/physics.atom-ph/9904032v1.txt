Abstract.
It is shown that recently measured cross sections for double
ionization of negative ions (H −, O−, and C−) possess a universal shape when
plotted in suitable dimensionless units. The shape can be represented with a
simple analytical function, following the same principles as it has been done in
establishing a universal shape function for single ionization [Rost and Pattard 1997
Phys. Rev. A 55 R5]. Thereby, it is demonstrated that direct double ionization
dominates the cross section for the targets considered.

In a complex ion such as O− double ionization can proceed along diﬀerent paths
utilizing intermediate excited (autoionizing) states. How important are these indirect
processes in comparison with direct double ionization (DDI) to describe total cross
sections for double ionization (DI) of negative ions by electron impact? A calculation
of a cross section from DDI processes alone compared to the experimental results
could answer this question. However, neither such a calculation nor a full calculation
exists for the published experimental cross sections involving the target ions H − [1]
and O−, C− [2]. Given this situation we have developed an alternative theoretical
approach which has been applied successfully to the single ionization of atoms [3] and
positively charged ions [4]. For these species we have established the existence and
analytical form of a universal shape function for the cross section. In contrast to well
known semi-empirical formulae (e.g. the Lotz formula [5]) our shape function uses the
analytically known form of the cross section at high and low energies. Moreover, and
this is crucial, the universal shape emerges only if the energy is measured from the
ionization threshold I of the respective process, i.e. E ≥ 0. (Usually, the energy is
given in terms of the impact energy E + I).

The shape function itself is parameter free. It can be directly compared to the
experimental cross section if the latter is plotted in dimensionless coordinates where
the cross section y is written in terms of its maximum value y = σ/σM and the energy
is expressed in a scale which corresponds to the energy EM where the maximum cross
section appears, x = E/EM . In practice, these two quantities σM and EM may be
viewed as ﬁtting parameters and determined by a ﬁt of the data to

σ(E) = σM f (E/EM )

The exponent β is the so called Wannier exponent which determines the energy
variation of the cross section at low energies [6]. The corresponding power law behavior
is included in (1) since σ(E → 0) ∝ (E/EM )β. For simplicity, the behavior for high
energies is assumed to be classical, i.e. 1/E ignoring the logarithmic correction [3].
With these features, (1) has been designed to describe processes dominated by direct
ionization (only in this case the speciﬁc power law applies - as does the single threshold
I). Thereby, it is not important how many electrons have been ionized. (The number
of ionized electrons enters (1) indirectly through the threshold exponent β which
depends on the fragments and their charges.)

Therefore, apart from providing a useful, simple and universal parameterization
for a large class of cross sections, (1) can be used to decide to which degree a cross
section is dominated by direct processes. First of all, even without knowing a suitable
parameterization of the cross section: if the shape of cross sections for rather diﬀerent
targets agrees one can conclude that their ionization is dominated by DDI. Secondly,
knowing the ﬁnal fragmented state of the system, one can usually calculate analytically
or numerically the exponent β and a quantitative comparison with the shape function
(1) becomes possible.

This is exactly our program for the rest of the paper. Firstly, we will demonstrate
that to a good degree the DI cross sections for various targets (H −, C−, and O−)
possess a common shape when plotted in scaled coordinates as described above. From
this observation we can conclude that the DI of these ions is dominated by direct
double ionization. Secondly, we use the value β = 2.83 as calculated in [7] for three
electrons and a positively charged ion in the continuum to construct the shape function
(1) for our present needs.

We start from the cross sections for DI of H − (double ionization potential
I = 14.35eV), C− (I = 12.52 eV) and O− (I = 15.08 eV) as shown in ﬁgure 1. First,
we replot these cross sections as a function of excess energy E in ﬁgure 2. Already
included in this ﬁgure is a ﬁt with (1) where the respective ﬁtting parameters σM , EM
are listed in table 1. As a ﬁnal step we scale the cross sections in terms of the respective
maximum values from table 1. The result is shown in ﬁgure 3 and demonstrates the
existence of a universal shape. Already at this point we may conclude that the process
of DI for the investigated negative ions is dominated by DDI.

Proceeding further, we have overlaid in ﬁgure 3 the shape function from (2) with
β = 2.83 (solid line). Obviously, this parameterization describes the universal shape
well in the energy interval considered. Hence, we have provided additional evidence for
the conjecture that double ionization of negative ions is dominated by direct processes.

This is in agreement with the conclusion reached in [2], although this conclusion was
somewhat weakened by the poor agreement with existing semiempirical formulae. In
one respect we arrive at a diﬀerent result: The Wannier-threshold behavior with the
exponent derived by Klar and Schlecht [7] ﬁts well into our description of the ionization
cross sections. In contrast, a ﬁt with (1) where β = 1.3 as suggested in [2] agrees only
poorly with the experimental cross sections. It seems that without a shape function
valid over a larger range of energy the determination of the threshold exponent β from
ﬁtting a cross section of the form σ ∝ Eβ to the data of ﬁgure 1 is rather unreliable.
Similar situations have been encountered for other collisional systems, in particular
with positron impact.

We conclude that due to the dominance of direct double ionization processes the

overall shape of DI cross sections is a rather robust function which is not strongly
inﬂuenced by details of the collision dynamics diﬀerent for each scattering system.
From the quality of the ﬁt, one may speculate that among the systems taken into
account here, C− exhibits the strongest inﬂuence of indirect DI processes (see table
1 and ﬁgures 2 and 3). However, even in this case the overall shape of the DI cross
section is still well reproduced by the shape function based only on DDI processes,
taking into consideration that the scale of the ordinate in our ﬁgures is linear in
contrast to the usual logarithmic representations of cross sections.

Zeros of Rydberg-Rydberg F¨oster Interactions

Abstract. Rydberg states of atoms are of great current interest for quantum
manipulation of mesoscopic samples of atoms. Long-range Rydberg-Rydberg
interactions can inhibit multiple excitations of atoms under the appropriate
conditions. These interactions are strongest when resonant collisional processes
give rise to long-range C3/R3 interactions. We show in this paper that even under
resonant conditions C3 often vanishes so that care is required to realize full dipole
blockade in micron-sized atom samples.

1. Introduction

Rydberg-Rydberg interactions are very interesting for use in mesoscopic quantum
manipulations. The extremely strong interactions between two Rydberg atoms have
been proposed to entangle large numbers of atoms in a non-trivial manner using
the phenomenon of blockade [1]. When a mesoscopic sample is illuminated with
narrowband lasers tuned to a Rydberg state, only one atom at a time can be excited
if the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction exceeds the linewidth of the laser-atom coupling.
Therefore the mesoscopic cloud of atoms behaves as an eﬀective 2-level system, with
the upper level being a single collective excitation.

In order to attain the strongest possible Rydberg blockade, it is desirable to
operate under conditions where the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction is not the usual
C5/R5 or C6/R6 van-der-Waals interactions, but instead is resonantly enhanced by
“F¨oster ” processes [1, 2] such as

(1)
that lead to isotropic C3/R3 long-range behavior when the ns+ns states are degenerate
with the np+ (n
1)p states. Dramatic enhancements of collisional interactions due to
such resonant couplings have been demonstrated for Rydberg excitation in a magneto-
optical trap[3]. The quantum nature of these types of interactions was recently used
to resolve molecules 12 nm apart in an organic solid [4]. Due to the high density of
Rydberg states, there are typically many candidate levels for such F¨oster processes.

An important consideration for quantum information applications of Rydberg
blockade is the size of cloud required. The spatial extent of the cloud must be small
enough for excitation of a single atom anywhere in the cloud to block the excitation
of every other atom in the cloud. Even with the great strength of Rydberg-Rydberg
interactions, the required size of the clouds is likely to be less than 10 microns for fast
(1 MHz) operations. Only recently have atom clouds of such small size been produced
in the laboratory[5, 6]. Even in the case that sub-micron mesoscopic samples are

realized experimentally, there are other applications of such samples that beneﬁt from
the sample being as large as possible. For example, we have recently proposed single-
photon sources, single-photon detectors, and quantum state transmission [7, 8] using
mesoscopic Rydberg blockade. In these applications one would like the cloud to be
many wavelengths in size in order that the diﬀraction limited light ﬁelds not occupy
too large a solid angle. For this to be eﬀective requires the blockade to operate over
clouds of several microns in extent.

The purpose of this paper is to examine some issues that arise in the application
of F¨oster processes to Rydberg blockade. In particular, when the quantum numbers
for the states are of the form

we show that one or more of the nl + nl states have C3 = 0. These “F¨oster zero”
states then only exhibit the usual van-der-Waals long-range behavior and will therefore
set limits on the attainable cloud sizes for quantum manipulations using Rydberg
blockade. Only when l′ = l′′ = l+1 are there no F¨oster zero states. Recent experiments
[9, 10] have observed strong suppression of excitation in very large clouds that is strong
evidence for blockade but do not address whether or not the blockade is complete as
required for quantum information applications.

In the following, we ﬁrst (Section 2) present a more detailed background discussion
of the importance of strong isotropic Rydberg-Rydberg interactions for quantum
manipulations using Rydberg blockade. We then illustrate in Section 3 how the
F¨oster process accomplishes this. Section 4 presents the main result of this paper: for
many possible F¨oster processes there exists a linear combination of atomic sublevels
that have C3 = 0. This result is extended to the important case of ﬁne-structure
interactions in Section 5. We conclude with more implications of this work.

2. Background

The basic physics behind the dipole-blockade concept is illustrated in Figure 1.
Suppose we have 2 atoms in an atomic ground state a. We envision exciting the
atoms to a Rydberg state r of energy Er using a narrowband laser. As shown in
the ﬁgure, excitation of one of the two atoms to the Rydberg state is allowed while
excitation of the second atom is oﬀ-resonant and therefore suppressed. Addition of
more atoms changes the eﬀectiveness of this “blockade” but does not change the basic
physics of the situation. Excitation of more than one atom is energetically suppressed
as long as the interaction between each pair of atoms in the ensemble exceeds the
bandwidth of the laser-atom excitation. Neglecting spontaneous emission or other
decohering eﬀects, when subject to dipole blockade and a continuous light ﬁeld the
atoms will undergo coherent Rabi oscillations between states a + a and a + r.

To see how this process can be used to generate interesting entanglement, we
state with a π pulse. The atoms will

simply imagine driving the atom pair in the

that cannot be written as a product of two individual wavefunctions and is therefore
entangled. To avoid the inevitable decoherence of the unstable Rydberg state, the
entanglement can be usefully transferred to a second ground state b with a π-pulse

to a collection of N atoms without loss of generality. The ﬁnal wavefunction is a

symmetric entangled superposition of N
There are several intriguing characteristics of this process. First, the entanglement
is generated between the internal states of the atom; any motion of the atom is
unimportant. This means that it is not necessary for the atoms to be localized in
the ground state of a conﬁning potential, so the method does not require coherence of
the external degrees of freedom of the atoms. There is also no motional constraint on
the speed at which the process can occur. Second, the value of the Rydberg-Rydberg
interaction D(R) is not important to ﬁrst order, as long as it is much larger than
the bandwidth of the light-atom interaction. This implies that the atoms can be at
random distances R from each other, as long as they are not too far apart. Finally,
since the blockade mechanism suppresses excitation of multiple Rydberg atoms, the
atoms never actually experience the strong Rydberg-Rydberg forces, avoiding heating.
Key to the entanglement process is the requirement that the Rydberg-Rydberg
frequency shift be large compared to the bandwidth of the light-atom interaction. If
this is violated, the ﬁdelity of the entanglement operations will be compromised. In a
mesoscopic sample, insuﬃcient blockade in any possible excitation channel is suﬃcient
to cause copious production of excited atoms. We now examine the Rydberg-Rydberg
interactions to see under what conditions this will be problematic.

3. F¨oster Process

We wish to consider the interactions between two like Rydberg atoms that lead to
blockade. Normally, in the absence of an external electric ﬁeld these interactions are of
the van-der-Waals forms 1/R5 or 1/R6. Since an electric ﬁeld mixes states of opposite
parity together, a Rydberg atom can have a permanent dipole moment, leading to a
much stronger and longer range 1/R3 interaction. The interaction between two such
atoms A and B is the familiar

It is possible to have an isotropic Rydberg atom-atom interaction of comparable
strength to this if there is a degeneracy in the energy-level spectrum for a pair of
atoms. For example, inspection of Figure 2 shows that the 50s state of Rb is nearly
symmetrically placed between the 49p and 50p states. This means that the 50s+50s
state of a Rydberg atom pair is nearly degenerate with the 49p+50p state. Neglecting
the inﬂuence of other nearby states, the eigenstates of the two-atom system are linear
combinations of 50s+50s and 49p+50p, with energy shifts proportional to 1/R3. Using
the methods described below, we ﬁnd that the Rydberg-Rydberg potential energy
curves are given by

A plot of U+(R) is shown in Figure 3. If there were perfect F¨oster degeneracy
(δ = 0) the dipole-dipole interaction would exceed 10 MHz out to distances of
10 microns. This would be very promising for realizing dipole blockade in quite
large clouds. However, the energy defect for real Rb atoms reduces the interaction

Here we should note that we are restricting ourselves to mixing of states that are nearly
resonant. Other states, such as 51p+48p in this example, have larger energy defects
(δ = 12 GHz for 51p+48p) and often much smaller matrix elements as well. Adding
up many such states could (and should) be done in second order perturbation theory
and will alter the 1/R6 part of the potential somewhat but not change the overall
conclusions. For the rest of this paper we will continue to neglect these other states.

Figure 3. Isotropic dipole-dipole interaction for excitation to the Rb 50s state.
The energy defect between the 50s+50s and 49p+50p states signiﬁcantly reduces
the interaction as compared to the ideal degenerate case. Going to larger n
partially compensates for the non-zero energy defect.

We will also neglect the 1/R5 quadrupole-quadrupole interactions.

The strength of the Rydberg-Rydberg interactions varies strongly with principal
quantum number. The radial matrix elements scale as n2, so U3 scales as n4. Since
the energy defect δ scales as n−3, the van-der-Waals interactions scale as U 2
n11.
Thus the range of the Rydberg blockade increases as roughly n11/6, so that n = 70
has nearly twice the range as n = 50, as illustrated in Figure 3. Increasing n comes
with increased sensitivity to stray electric ﬁelds, black-body radiation, and so forth.
In practice, states up to n
100 should be stable enough to perform fast quantum
operations[12]. However, it would be preferable to ﬁnd states with smaller energy
defects and therefore larger range at smaller n.

Given the lack of perfect F¨oster resonances for the s-state, one should consider
the possibility of F¨oster processes in other angular momentum states where the energy
defects may be smaller than they are for the s states.

4. F¨oster zeros

Interesting new properties of the F¨oster process arise when we consider higher angular
momentum states. For example, consider again the s and p states of Rb, but this time
with laser excitation of the p-states, so that the relevant F¨oster degeneracy is, say,
50p+50p
50s+51s with an energy defect δ =930 MHz. Suppose also that the atoms
are subject to linearly polarized light polarized along the laboratory ˆz-axis. We shall
show that there is no F¨oster blockade for this situation. For simplicity, let us assume
that two atoms are aligned with ˆR = ˆz. In this case, consider the wavefunction

and so the only long-range interaction will be a van-der-Waals interaction with the
comparatively far oﬀ-resonant d+d and d+s states. Note that
is strongly coupled
to the light through its
part. With strong light coupling and weak dipole-
dipole coupling, we conclude that the Rb p-states will not experience long-range dipole
blockade. These conclusions are not changed when ˆR is rotated away from ˆz. If one
takes the quantization axis along ˆR then
stays of the same form, but each of the

Another very interesting possibility from Figure 2 is the nearly degenerate

50p+46f with an energy defect of only 110 MHz (neglecting

large distance as compared to the s + s states. In this case there is also a wavefunction
with zero coupling via VDD to the p+f manifold:

Whereas the F¨oster zero state of Equation 6 can be deduced in a straightforward

since its matrix elements with each of the three

These results can also be understood from the point of view of the molecular

5. Fine Structure Eﬀects

In general, the ﬁne stucture interaction cannot be neglected. At n = 50 the Rb p-state
ﬁne structure splitting is about 800 MHz and the d splitting is 100 MHz, so that at
micron-scale distances there will be strong ﬁne-structure mixing by the dipole-dipole
interaction. At long enough range, where the dipole-dipole interaction is smaller than
the ﬁne-structure splitting, we can use the same type of arguments as above to analyze
the problem.

Let us consider the F¨oster process

6. Conclusions

The primary result of this paper is that the very long-range C3/R3 interactions
n′l1 + n′′l2 have states with C3 = 0 unless
produced by resonances nl + nl
l1 = l2 = l + 1. This strongly reduces the number of possibilities for attaining high
ﬁdelity dipole-blockade in mesoscopic atom samples. One solution is to rely instead
on quadrupole-quadrupole (1/R5) or second-order dipole-dipole (1/R6) interactions
to acheive blockade at high values of n. As pointed out recently by the Connecticut
group [14, 9] the interactions under these conditions can be quite strong.

→

Another possibility for attaining strong dipole blockade is to tune l1 = l2 = l + 1
resonances with an electric ﬁeld. For example, the great sensitivity of f states to
f + f into resonance at modest ﬁelds. At resonance,
electric ﬁelds can tune d + d
0.158U3 and thus
the long range potentials for this case are
should lead to quite strong Rydberg blockade at long range.

For the calculation of matrix elements in this paper, we have used the l-dependent core
potentials of Marinescu et. al [15] and obtained the radial wavefunctions by Numerov
integration of the Schr¨odinger equation. Energy levels were calculated using the recent
quantum defect determinations of Li et al.[16].

A nonperturbative numerical evaluation of the one-photon electron self energy for the K- and
L-shell states of hydrogenlike ions with nuclear charge numbers Z = 1 to 5 is described. Our
calculation for the 1S1/2 state has a numerical uncertainty of 0.8 Hz in atomic hydrogen, and for
the L-shell states (2S1/2, 2P1/2, and 2P3/2) the numerical uncertainty is 1.0 Hz. The method of
evaluation for the ground state and for the excited states is described in detail. The numerical
results are compared to results based on known terms in the expansion of the self energy in powers
of Zα.

I. INTRODUCTION

The nonperturbative numerical evaluation of radiative
corrections to bound-state energy levels is interesting for
two reasons. First, the recent dramatic increase in the
accuracy of experiments that measure the transition fre-
quencies in hydrogen and deuterium [1–3] necessitates
a numerical evaluation (nonperturbative in the binding
Coulomb ﬁeld) of the radiative corrections to the spec-
trum of atomic systems with low nuclear charge Z. Sec-
ond, the numerical calculation serves as an independent
test of analytic evaluations which are based on an expan-
sion in the binding ﬁeld with an expansion parameter Zα.
In order to address both issues, a high-precision nu-
merical evaluation of the self energy of an electron in
the ground state in hydrogenlike ions has been per-
formed [4, 5]. The approach outlined in [4] is generalized
here to the L shell, and numerical results are obtained

for the (n = 2) states 2S1/2, 2P1/2 and 2P3/2. Results
are provided for atomic hydrogen, He+, Li2+, Be3+, and
B4+.

It has been pointed out in [4, 5] that the nonpertur-
bative eﬀects (in Zα) can be large even for low nuclear
charge and exceed the current experimental accuracy for
atomic transitions. For example, the diﬀerence between
the sum of the analytically evaluated terms up to the
order of α (Zα)6 and the ﬁnal numerical result for the
ground state is roughly 27 kHz for atomic hydrogen and
about 3200 kHz for He+. For the 2S state the diﬀerence
is 3.5 kHz for atomic hydrogen and 412 kHz for He+.
The large diﬀerence between the result obtained by an
expansion in Zα persists even after the inclusion of a re-
sult recently obtained in [6] for the logarithmic term of
order α (Zα)7 ln(Zα)−2. For the ground state, the dif-
ference between the all-order numerical result and the
sum of the perturbative terms is still 13 kHz for atomic
hydrogen and 1600 kHz for He+. For the 2 S state, the
diﬀerence amounts to 1.6 kHz for atomic hydrogen and
to 213 kHz for He+.

These ﬁgures should be compared to the current exper-
imental precision. The most accurately measured tran-
sition to date is the 1S–2S frequency in hydrogen; it has
been measured with a relative uncertainty of 1.8 parts in
1014 or 46 Hz [3]. This experimental progress is due in
part to the use of frequency chains that bridge the range
between optical frequencies and the microwave cesium
time standard. The uncertainty of the measurement is
likely to be reduced by an order of magnitude in the near
future [3, 7]. With trapped hydrogen atoms, it should
be feasible to observe the 1S–2S frequency with an ex-
perimental linewidth that approaches the 1.3 Hz natural
width of the 2S level [8, 9].

The perturbation series in Zα is slowly convergent.
The all-order numerical calculation presented in this pa-
per essentially eliminates the uncertainty from unevalu-
ated higher-order analytic terms, and we obtain results
for the self-energy remainder function GSE with a preci-
sion of roughly 0.8× Z 4 Hz for the ground state of atomic
hydrogen and 1.0 × Z 4 Hz for the 2S state.

In the evaluation, we take advantage of resummation
and convergence acceleration techniques. The resumma-
tion techniques provide an eﬃcient method of evaluation
of the Dirac-Coulomb Green function to a relative un-
certainty of 10−24 over a wide parameter range [5]. The
convergence acceleration techniques remove the princi-
pal numerical diﬃculties associated with the singularity
of the relativistic propagators for nearly equal radial ar-
guments [10].

The one-photon self energy treated in the current in-
vestigation is about two orders of magnitude larger than
the other contributions to the Lamb shift in atomic hy-
drogen. A comprehensive review of the various contri-
butions to the Lamb shift in hydrogenlike atoms in the
full range of nuclear charge numbers Z = 1–110 has been
given in [11–14].

This paper is organized as follows. The method of eval-
uation is discussed in Sec. II. The calculation is divided
into a low-energy part and a high-energy contribution.
The low-energy part is treated in Sec. III, and the high-
energy part is discussed in Sec. IV. Numerical results are
compiled in Sec. V. Also in Sec. V, we compare numeri-
cal and analytic results for the Lamb shift in the region of
low nuclear charge numbers. Of special importance is the
consistency check with available analytic results [15, 16]
for higher-order binding corrections to the Lamb shift.
We make concluding remarks in Sec. VI.

II. METHOD OF EVALUATION

A. Status of Analytic Calculations

The (real part of the) energy shift ∆ESE due to the
electron self-energy radiative correction is usually writ-
ten as

∆ESE =

α
π

(Zα)4
n3 F (nlj, Zα) me c2

(2.1)

where F is a dimensionless quantity.
In the following,
the natural unit system with ¯h = c = me = 1 and
e2 = 4πα is employed. Note that F (nlj, Zα) is a dimen-
sionless function which depends for a given atomic state
with quantum numbers n, l and j on only one argument
(the coupling Zα). For excited states, the (nonvanishing)
imaginary part of the self energy is proportional to the
(spontaneous) decay width of the state. We will denote
here the real part of the self energy by ∆ESE, exclusively.
The semi-analytic expansion of F (nlj, Zα) about Zα = 0
for a general atomic state with quantum numbers n, l and
j gives rise to the semi-analytic expansion,

F (nlj, Zα) = A41(nlj) ln(Zα)−2

+A40(nlj) + (Zα) A50(nlj)

+ (Zα)2 (cid:2)A62(nlj) ln2(Zα)−2

2

+A61(nlj) ln(Zα)−2 + GSE(nlj, Zα)(cid:3) .

For particular states, some of the coeﬃcients may van-
ish. Notably, this is the case for P states, which are less
singular than S states at the origin [see Eq. (2.4) below].
For the nS1/2 state (l = 0, j = 1/2), none of the terms
in Eq. (2.2) vanishes, and we have,

(2.2)

F (nS1/2, Zα) = A41(nS1/2) ln(Zα)−2

+A40(nS1/2) + (Zα) A50(nS1/2)

+ (Zα)2 (cid:2)A62(nS1/2) ln2(Zα)−2
+A61(nS1/2) ln(Zα)−2 + GSE(nS1/2, Zα)(cid:3) .

The A coeﬃcients have two indices, the ﬁrst of which de-
notes the power of Zα [including those powers implicitly
contained in Eq. (2.1)], while the second index denotes
the power of the logarithm ln(Zα)−2. For P states, the
coeﬃcients A41, A50 and A62 vanish, and we have

(2.3)

F (nPj, Zα) = A40(nPj)

+(Zα)2 (cid:2)A61(nPj) ln(Zα)−2 + GSE(nPj, Zα)(cid:3) . (2.4)

For S states, the self-energy remainder function GSE can
be expanded semi-analytically as

GSE(nS1/2, Zα) = A60(nS1/2)

+(Zα) (cid:2)A71(nS1/2) ln(Zα)−2
+A70(nS1/2) + o(Zα)(cid:3)

(2.5)

(for the “order” symbols o and O we follow the usual con-
vention, see e.g. [17, 18]). For P states, the semi-analytic
expansion of GSE reads

GSE(nPj, Zα) = A60(nPj)

+(Zα) [A70(nPj) + o(Zα)] .

(2.6)

The fact that A71(nPj) vanishes has been pointed out
in [6]. We list below the analytic coeﬃcients and the
Bethe logarithms relevant to the atomic states under in-
vestigation. For the ground state, the coeﬃcients A41
and A40 were obtained in [19–25], the correction term
A50 was found in [26–28], and the higher-order binding
corrections A62 and A61 were evaluated in [15, 29–37].
The results are,

A41(1S1/2) =

,

A40(1S1/2) =

28
A61(1S1/2) =
3

ln 2 −

21

.

(2.7)

The Bethe logarithm ln k0(1S) has been evaluated in [38]
and [39–43] as

ln k0(1S) = 2.984 128 555 8(3).

(2.8)

For the 2S state, we have

,

A40(2S1/2) =

A41(2S1/2) =

4
3
10

A50(2S1/2) = 4π (cid:20) 139

ln k0(2S) ,

1
2

ln 2(cid:21) ,

ln 2 +

.

(2.9)

The Bethe logarithm ln k0(2S) has been evaluated
(see [38–43], the results exhibit varying accuracy) as

ln k0(2S) = 2.811 769 893(3).

(2.10)

It might be worth noting that the value for ln k0(2S)
given in [44] evidently contains a typographical error.
Our independent re-evaluation conﬁrms the result given
in Eq. (2.10), which was originally obtained in [38] to the
required precision. For the 2P1/2 state we have

1
A40(2P1/2) = −
6 −
103
108

A61(2P1/2) =

.

4
3

ln k0(2P) ,

(2.11)

Note that a general analytic result for the logarithmic
correction A61 as a function of the bound state quan-
tum numbers n, l and j can be inferred from Eq. (4.4a)
of [34, 35] upon subtraction of the vacuum polarization
contribution implicitly contained in the quoted equation.
The Bethe logarithm for the 2P states reads [38, 45]

ln k0(2P) = −0.030 016 708 9(3) .

(2.12)

Because the Bethe logarithm is an inherently nonrela-
tivistic quantity, it is spin-independent and therefore in-
dependent of the total angular momentum j for a given
orbital angular momentum l. For the 2P3/2 state the
analytic coeﬃcients are

A40(2P3/2) =

A61(2P3/2) =

4

ln k0(2P) ,

We now consider the limit of the function GSE(Zα) as
Zα → 0. The higher-order terms in the potential expan-
sion (see Fig. 3 below) and relativistic corrections to the
wavefunction both generate terms of higher order in Zα
which are manifest in Eq. (2.2) in the form of the nonva-
nishing function GSE(Zα) which summarizes the eﬀects
of the relativistic corrections to the bound electron wave
function and of higher-order terms in the potential ex-
pansion. For very soft virtual photons, the potential ex-
pansion fails and generates an infrared divergence which
is cut oﬀ by the atomic momentum scale, Zα. This cut-
oﬀ for the infrared divergence is one of the mechanisms
which lead to the logarithmic terms in Eq. (2.2). Some
of the nonlogarithmic terms of relative order (Zα)2 in
Eq. (2.2) are generated by the relativistic corrections to
the wave function. The function GSE does not vanish,
but approaches a constant in the limit Zα → 0. This
constant can be determined by analytic or semi-analytic
calculations; it is referred to as the A60 coeﬃcient, i.e.

A60(nlj) = GSE(nlj, 0) .

(2.14)

The evaluation of the coeﬃcient A60(1S1/2) has been his-
torically problematic [15, 34–37]. For the 2S state, there
is currently only one precise analytic result available,

A60(2S1/2) = −31.840 47(1)

[15] .

(2.15)

For the 2P1/2 state, the analytically obtained result is

A60(2P1/2) = −0.998 91(1)

[16] ,

(2.16)

and for the 2P3/2 state, we have

A60(2P3/2) = −0.503 37(1)

[16] .

(2.17)

The analytic evaluations essentially rely on an expansion
of the relativistic Dirac-Coulomb propagator in powers of
the binding ﬁeld, i.e. in powers of Coulomb interactions
of the electron with the nucleus.
In numerical evalua-
tions, the binding ﬁeld is treated nonperturbatively, and
no expansion is performed.

B. Formulation of the Numerical Problem

Numerical cancellations are severe for small nuclear
charges. In order to understand the origin of the numer-
ical cancellations it is necessary to consider the renor-
malization of the self energy. The renormalization pro-
cedure postulates that the self energy is essentially the
eﬀect on the bound electron due to the self interaction
with its own radiation ﬁeld, minus the same eﬀect on a
free electron which is absorbed in the mass of the elec-
tron and therefore not observable. The self energy of
the bound electron is the residual eﬀect obtained after
the subtraction of two large quantities. Terms associ-
ated with renormalization counterterms are of order 1 in

the Zα-expansion, whereas the residual eﬀect is of or-
der (Zα)4 [see Eq. (2.1)]. This corresponds to a loss
of roughly 9 signiﬁcant digits at Z = 1. Consequently,
even the precise evaluation of the one-photon self energy
in a Coulomb ﬁeld presented in [46] extends only down
to Z = 5. Among the self-energy corrections in one-
loop and higher-loop order, numerical cancellations in
absolute terms are most severe for the one-loop problem
because of the large size of the eﬀect of the one-loop self-
energy correction on the spectrum.

Integration contour C for the integration over the
energy ω = En − z of the virtual photon. The contour C
consists of the low-energy contour CL and the high-energy
contour CH. Lines shown displaced directly below and above
the real axis denote branch cuts from the photon and elec-
tron propagator. Crosses denote poles originating from the
discrete spectrum of the electron propagator. The contour
used in this work corresponds to the one used in [47].

For our high-precision numerical evaluation, we start

The contour CF in Eq. (2.18) is the Feynman contour,
whereas the contour C is depicted in Fig. 1. The contour
C is employed for the ω-integration in the current evalu-
ation [see the last line of Eq. (2.18)]. The energy variable
z in Eq. (2.19) therefore assumes the value

z = En − ω ,

(2.22)

where En is the Dirac energy of the atomic state, and ω
denotes the complex-valued energy of the virtual photon.
It is understood that the limit Λ → ∞ is taken after all
integrals in Eq. (2.18) are evaluated.

Separation of the low-energy contour CL into
the infrared part CIR and the middle-energy part CM. As
in Fig. 1, the lines directly above and below the real axis
denote branch cuts from the photon and electron propaga-
tor. Strictly speaking, the ﬁgure is valid only for the ground
state. For excited states, some of the crosses, which denote
poles originating from the discrete spectrum of the electron
propagator, are positioned to the right of the line Re ω = 0.
These poles are subtracted in the numerical evaluation.

The integration contour for the complex-valued energy
of the virtual photon ω in this calculation is the contour
C employed in [46–49] and depicted in Fig. 1. The inte-
grations along the low-energy contour CL and the high-
energy contour CH in Fig. 1 give rise to the low- and the
high-energy contributions ∆EL and ∆EH to the self en-
ergy, respectively. Here, we employ a further separation
of the low-energy integration contour CL into an infrared
contour CIR and a middle-energy contour CM shown in
Fig. 2. This separation gives rise to a separation of the
low-energy part ∆EL into the infrared part ∆EIR and
the middle-energy part ∆EM,

∆EL = ∆EIR + ∆EM .

(2.23)

For the low-Z systems discussed here, all complications
which arise for excited states due to the decay into the
ground state are relevant only for the infrared part. Ex-
cept for the further separation into the infrared and the
middle-energy part, the same basic formulation of the
self-energy problem as in [47] is used. This leads to the
following separation:

; infrared part ∆EIR,

10 En) ± i δ
10 En, En) ± i δ

ω ∈ (0, 1
ω ∈ ( 1
ω ∈ En + i (−∞, +∞) ; high-energy part ∆EH.

; middle-energy part ∆EM,

Integration along these contours gives rise to the infrared,
the middle-energy, and the high-energy contributions to
the energy shift. For all of these contributions, lower-
order terms are subtracted in order to obtain the contri-
bution to the self energy of order (Zα)4. We obtain for
the infrared part,

∆EIR =

α

π (cid:20) 21

(Zα)4

43
600hV i
n3 FIR(nlj, Zα)(cid:21) ,

+

(2.24)

where FIR(nlj, Zα) is a dimensionless function of order
one. The middle-energy part is recovered as

∆ESE = ∆EIR + ∆EM + EH − ∆m

=

α
π

(Zα)4

n3

[FIR(nlj, Zα)

+FM(nlj, Zα) + FH(nlj, Zα)] .

(2.29)

The scaled self-energy function F deﬁned in Eq. (2.1) is
therefore obtained as

F (nlj, Zα) = FIR(nlj, Zα)

+FM(nlj, Zα) + FH(nlj, Zα) .

(2.30)

In analogy to the approach described in [46, 47, 49], we
deﬁne the low-energy part as the sum of the infrared part
and the middle-energy part,

∆EL = ∆EIR + ∆EM

(2.25)

The limits for the functions FL(nlj, Zα) and FH(nlj, Zα)
as Zα → 0 were obtained in [5, 48, 50].

C. Treatment of the divergent terms

(2.26)

The free electron propagator

The infrared part is discussed in Sec. III A. The middle-
energy part is divided into a middle-energy subtraction
term FMA and a middle-energy remainder FMB. The
subtraction term FMA is discussed in Sec. III B, the re-
mainder term FMB is treated in Sec. III C. We recover
the middle-energy term as the sum

FM(nlj, Zα) = FMA(nlj, Zα) + FMB(nlj, Zα) . (2.27)

A similar separation is employed for the high-energy part.
The high-energy part is divided into a subtraction term
FHA, which is evaluated in Sec. IV A, and the high-energy
remainder FHB, which is discussed in Sec. IV B. The sum
of the subtraction term and the remainder is

FH(nlj, Zα) = FHA(nlj, Zα) + FHB(nlj, Zα) .

(2.28)

The total energy shift is given as

F =

1

α · p + β − z

(2.33)

and the full electron propagator G deﬁned in Eq. (2.19)
fulﬁll the following identity, which is of particular impor-
tance for the validity of the method used in the numerical
evaluation of the all-order binding correction to the Lamb
shift:

G = F − F V F + F V G V F .

(2.34)

This identity leads naturally to a separation of the one-
photon self energy into a zero-vertex, a single-vertex, and
a many-vertex term. This is represented diagrammati-
cally in Fig. 3.

FIG. 3. The exact expansion of the bound electron prop-
agator in powers of the binding ﬁeld leads to a zero-potential,
a one-potential, and a many-potential term. The dashed lines
denote Coulomb photons, the crosses denote the interaction
with the (external) binding ﬁeld.

All ultraviolet divergences which occur in the one-
photon problem (mass counter term and vertex diver-
gence) are generated by the zero-vertex and the single-
vertex terms. The many-vertex term is ultraviolet safe.
Of crucial importance is the observation that one may
additionally simplify the problem by replacing the one-
potential term with an approximate expression in which
the potential is “commuted to the outside.” The ap-
proximate expression generates all divergences and all
terms of lower order than α (Zα)4 present in the one-
vertex term. Unlike the raw one-potential term, it is
amenable to signiﬁcant further simpliﬁcation and can be
reduced to one-dimensional numerical integrals that can
be evaluated easily (a straightforward formulation of the
self-energy problem requires a three-dimensional numer-
ical integration). Without this signiﬁcant improvement,
an all-order calculation would be much more diﬃcult at
low nuclear charge, because the lower-order terms would
introduce signiﬁcant further numerical cancellations.

In addition, the special approximate resolvent can be
used eﬀectively for an eﬃcient subtraction scheme in the
middle-energy part of the calculation.
In the infrared
part, such a subtraction is not used because it would in-
troduce infrared divergences.

We now turn to the construction of the special ap-
proximate resolvent, which will be referred to as GA and
will be used in this calculation to isolate the ultraviolet
divergences in the high-energy part (and to provide sub-
traction terms in the middle-energy part). It is based on
an approximation to the ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand
side of Eq. (2.34). The so-called one-potential term F V F
in Eq. (2.34) is approximated by an expression in which
the potential terms V are commuted to the outside:

− F V F ≈ −

1

2 (cid:8)V, F 2(cid:9) .

Furthermore, the following identity is used:

(2.35)

6

F 2 =(cid:18)

=

1

α · p + β − z(cid:19)2
p2 + 1 − z2 +

1

2 z (β + z)
(p2 + 1 − z2)2

+

2 z (α · p)
(p2 + 1 − z2)2 .

(2.36)

In 2× 2 spinor space, this expression may be divided into
a diagonal and a non-diagonal part. The diagonal part
is

diag(F 2) =

1

p2 + 1 − z2 +

2 z (β + z)

(p2 + 1 − z2)2 .

(2.37)

The oﬀ-diagonal part is given by

F 2 − diag(F 2) =

2 z (α · p)
(p2 + 1 − z2)2 .

We deﬁne the resolvent GA as

GA = F −

1

2 (cid:8)V, diag(cid:0)F 2(cid:1)(cid:9) .

(2.38)

All divergences which occur in the self energy are gen-
erated by the simpliﬁed propagator GA. We deﬁne the
propagator GB as the diﬀerence of G and GA,

GB = G − GA

1

=

2 (cid:8)V, diag(F 2)(cid:9) − F V F + F V G V F .

(2.39)

GB does not generate any divergences and leads to the
middle-energy remainder discussed in Sec. III C and the
high-energy remainder (Sec. IV B).

where relevant deﬁnitions of the symbols can be found in
Eqs. (2.18–2.21), the contour CIR is as shown in Fig. 2,
and the unregularized version of the photon propagator

(3.1)

Dµν (k2) = −

may be used. The infrared part consists of the following
integration region for the virtual photon:

is made, so that r ∈ (0, 1) and y ∈ (0,∞). The scaling
variable a is deﬁned as

ω ∈(cid:0)0, 1
10 En(cid:1) ± i δ
z ∈(cid:0) 9

Following Secs. 2 and 3 of [47], we write ∆EIR as a
three-dimensional integral [see, e.g., Eqs. (3.4), (3.11),
and (3.14) of [47]]

Here, the quantum number κ is the Dirac angular quan-
tum number of the intermediate state,

κ = 2 (l − j) (j + 1/2) ,

(3.6)

where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum num-
ber and j is the total angular momentum of the bound
electron. The functions fi(x2) (i = 1, 2) are the radial
wave functions deﬁned in Eq. (A.4) in [47] for an arbi-
trary bound state (and in Eq. (A.8) in [47] for the 1S
state). We deﬁne ¯ı = 3 − i. The functions Gij
κ (x2, x1, z)
(i, j = 1, 2) are the radial Green functions, which re-
sult from a decomposition of the electron Green function
deﬁned in Eq. (2.19) into partial waves. The explicit for-
mulas are given in Eq. (A.16) in [47].
The photon angular functions Aij

κ (i, j = 1, 2) are de-
ﬁned in Eq. (3.15) of Ref. [47] for an arbitrary bound
state. In Eq. (3.17) in [47], speciﬁc formulas are given
for the 1S state.
In Eqs. (2.2), (2.3) and (2.4) of [49],
the special cases of S1/2, P1/2 and P3/2 states are con-
sidered. Further relevant formulas for excited states can
be found in [51]. The photon angular functions depend
on the energy argument z, but this dependence is usually
suppressed. The summation over κ in Eq. (3.5) extends
over all negative and all positive integers, excluding zero.
We observe that the integral is symmetric under the in-
terchange of the radial coordinates x2 and x1, so that

The speciﬁcation of the principal value (P.V.) is neces-
sary for the excited states of the L shell, because of the
poles along the integration contour which correspond to
the spontaneous decay into the ground state. Here we
are exclusively concerned with the real part of the energy
shift, as speciﬁed in Eq. (3.1), which is equivalent to the
speciﬁcation of the principal value in (3.13). Evaluation
of the integral over z is facilitated by the subtraction of
those terms which generate the singularities along the in-
tegration contour (for higher excited states, there can be
numerous bound state poles, as pointed out in [51, 52]).
For the 2S and 2P1/2 states, only the pole contribution
from the ground state must be subtracted. For the 2P3/2
state, pole contributions originating from the 1S, the 2S
and the 2P1/2 states must be taken into account. The nu-
merical evaluation of the subtracted integrand proceeds

along ideas outlined in [49, 51] and is not discussed here
in any further detail.

The scaling parameter a for the integration over y is
chosen to simplify the exponential dependence of the
function S deﬁned in Eq. (3.11). The main exponen-
tial dependence is given by the relativistic radial wave
functions (upper and lower components). Both compo-
nents [f1(x) and f2(x)] vary approximately as (neglecting
relatively slowly varying factors)

exp (−a x/2)

(for large x) .

The scaling variable a, expanded in powers of Zα, is

n

a = 2p1 − E2
= 2s1 −(cid:18)1 −

(Zα)2

2 n2 + O [(Zα)4](cid:19)2

= 2

Zα
n

+ O(cid:2)(Zα)3(cid:3) .

(3.14)

Therefore, a is just twice the inverse of the Bohr radius
n/(Zα) in the nonrelativistic limit. The product

f¯ı(cid:16) ry

a (cid:17) × f¯(cid:16) y
a(cid:17)

for arbitrary ¯ı, ¯ ∈ {1, 2}

[which occurs in Eq. (3.11)] depends on the radial argu-
ments approximately as

e−y × exph 1

2

(1 − r) yi

(for large y) .

Note that the main dependence as given by the term
exp(−y) is exactly the weight factor of the Gauß-
Laguerre integration quadrature formula. The deviation
from the exact exp(−y)–type behavior becomes smaller
as r → 1. This is favorable because the region near r = 1
gives a large contribution to the integral in (3.13).

The sum over |κ| in Eq. (3.11) is carried out locally,
i.e., for each set of arguments r, y, z. The sum over |κ| is
absolutely convergent. For |κ| → ∞, the convergence of
the sum is governed by the asymptotic behavior of the
Bessel functions which occur in the photon functions Aij
κ
(i, j = 1, 2) [see Eqs. (3.15) and (3.16) in [47]]. The pho-
ton functions contain products of two Bessel functions of
the form Jl(ρ2/1) where Jl stands for either jl or j′
l, and
the index l is in the range l ∈ {|κ|− 1,|κ|,|κ| + 1}. The
argument is either ρ2 = (En − z) x2 or ρ1 = (En − z) x1.
The asymptotic behavior of the two relevant Bessel func-
tions for large l (and therefore large |κ|) is

the maximum angular momentum quantum number |κ|
in the numerical calculation of the infrared part is less
than 3 000. Note that because z ∈ ( 9
10 En, En) in the
infrared part, ω < 1

10 En.

The integration scheme is based on a crude estimate
of the dependence of the integrand SIR(r, y, z) deﬁned
in Eq. (3.11) on the integration variables r, y and z. The
main contribution to the integral is given by the region
where the arguments of the Whittaker functions as they
occur in the Green function [see Eq. (A.16) in [47]] are
much larger than the Dirac angular momentum,

(see also p. 56 of [48]). We assume the asymptotic form
of the Green function given in Eq. (A.3) in [48] applies
and attribute a factor

This implies that when min{ρ2, ρ1} = ρ2 < l, the func-
tion Jl(ρ2) vanishes with increasing l approximately as
(e ρ2/2l)l. This rapidly converging asymptotic behavior
sets in as soon as l ≈ |κ| > ρ2 = r ω y/a [see Eqs. (2.22)
and (3.12)]. Due to the rapid convergence for |κ| > ρ2,

exp[−(1 − r) c y/a]
to the radial Green functions Gij
κ as they occur in
Eq. (3.11). Note that relatively slowly varying factors
are replaced by unity. The products of the radial wave

Eq. (3.14), behave as

sin[(1 − r) (En − z) y/a]

(1 − r)

.

(3.17)

for SIR. The three-dimensional integral in (3.13) is eval-
uated by successive Gaussian quadrature. Details of the
integration procedure can be found in [5].

In order to check the numerical stability of the results,
the calculations are repeated with three diﬀerent values
of the ﬁne-structure constant α:

α< = 1/137.036 000 5 ,
α0 = 1/137.036 000 0
α> = 1/137.035 999 5 .

and,

(3.19)

These values are close to the 1998 CODATA recom-
mended value of α−1 = 137.035 999 76(50) [53]. The
calculation was parallelized using the Message Passing
Interface (MPI) and carried out on a cluster of Silicon
Graphics workstations and on an IBM 9276 SP/2 multi-
processor system [54]. The results for the infrared part
FIR, deﬁned in Eq. (2.24), are given in Table I for a value
of α−1 = α−1
0 = 137.036. This value of α will be used
exclusively in the numerical evaluations presented here.
For numerical results obtained by employing the values
of α< and α> [see Eq. (3.19)] we refer to [5].

The numerical evaluation of the middle-energy part is
simpliﬁed considerably by the decomposition of the rela-
tivistic Dirac-Coulomb Green function G as

G = GA + GB ,

(3.22)

where GA is deﬁned in (2.38) and represents the sum of
an approximation to the so-called zero- and one-potential
terms generated by the expansion of the Dirac-Coulomb
Green function G in powers of the binding ﬁeld V . We
deﬁne the middle-energy subtraction term FMA as the
expression obtained upon substitution of the propagator
GA for G in Eq. (3.20). The propagator GB is simply
calculated as the diﬀerence of G and GA [see Eq. (2.39)].
A substitution of the propagator GB for G in Eq. (3.20)
leads to the middle-energy remainder FMB which is dis-
cussed in Sec. III C. We provide here the explicit expres-

C. The Middle-Energy Remainder

The remainder term in the middle-energy part involves
the propagator GB deﬁned in Eq. (2.39), GB = G − GA,
where G is deﬁned in (2.19) and GA is given in (2.38).

In analogy to the middle-energy subtraction term, the
middle-energy remainder can be rewritten as a three-

The functions Gij

expansion of the full propagator G and the simpliﬁed
propagator GA into angular momenta,

Gij

B,κ = Gij

(3.32)

where the Gij
κ are listed in Eq. (A.16) in [47] and in
Eq. (D.43) in [5], and the Gij
A,κ have already been de-
ﬁned in Eqs. (5.4) and (A.20) in [47] and in Eqs. (D.37)
and (D.42) in [5]. There are no lower-order terms to sub-
tract, and therefore

∆EMB =

α
π

(Zα)4
n3 FMB(nlj, Zα) .

(3.33)

The three-dimensional integral (3.30) is evaluated by suc-
cessive Gaussian quadrature. Details of the integration
procedure are provided in [5]. Numerical results for the
middle-energy remainder FMB are summarized in Ta-
ble II for the K- and L-shell states.

For the middle-energy part, the separation into a sub-
traction and a remainder term has considerable compu-
tational advantages which become obvious upon inspec-
tion of Eqs. (3.29) and (3.33). The subtraction involves
a propagator whose angular components can be evalu-
ated by recursion [5, 48], which is computationally time-
consuming. Because the subtraction term involves lower-
order components [see Eq. (2.25)], it has to be evaluated
to high precision numerically (in a typical case, a rela-
tive uncertainty of 10−19 is required). This high preci-
sion requires in turn a large number of integration points
for the Gaussian quadratures, which is possible only if
the numerical evaluation of the integrand is not compu-
tationally time-consuming. For the remainder term, no
lower-order terms have to be subtracted, and the rela-
tive precision required of the integrals is in the range
of 10−11 . . . 10−9. A numerical evaluation to this lower
level of precision is feasible, although the calculation of
the Green function GB is computationally more time con-
suming than that of GA [5, 47, 48]. The separation of the
high-energy part into a subtraction term and a remain-
der term, which is discussed in Sec. IV, is motivated by

analogous considerations as for the middle-energy part.
In the high-energy part, this separation is even more im-
portant than in the middle-energy part, because of the
occurrence of inﬁnite terms which need to be subtracted
analytically before a numerical evaluation can proceed
[see Eq. (4.8) below].

We now summarize the results for the middle-energy
part. The middle-energy part is the sum of the middle-
energy subtraction term FMA and the middle-energy re-
mainder FMB [see also Eq. (2.27)]. Numerical results are
summarized in Table II for the K- and L-shell states. The
low-energy part FL is deﬁned as the sum of the infrared
contribution FIR and the middle-energy contribution FM
[see Eq. (2.32)]. The results for FL are provided in the
Table III for the K- and L-shell states. The limits for the
low-energy part as a function of the bound state quantum
numbers can be found in Eq. (7.80) of [5]:

The limits for the states under investigation in this paper
are

FL(1S1/2, Zα) = (4/3) ln(Zα)−2 − 1.554 642 + O(Zα) ,
FL(2S1/2, Zα) = (4/3) ln(Zα)−2 − 1.191 497 + O(Zα) ,
FL(2P1/2, Zα) = 0.940 023 + O(Zα) ,

FL(2P3/2, Zα) = 0.690 023 + O(Zα) .

(3.35)

These limits are consistent with the numerical data in
Table III. For S states, the low-energy contribution FL
diverges logarithmically as Zα → 0, whereas for P states,
FL approaches a constant as Zα → 0. The leading loga-
rithm is a consequence of an infrared divergence cut oﬀ
by the atomic momentum scale.
It is a nonrelativistic
eﬀect which is generated by the nonvanishing probabil-
ity density of S waves at the origin in the nonrelativistic
limit. The presence of the logarithmic behavior for S
states [nonvanishing A41-coeﬃcient, see Eqs. (2.2) and
(2.3)] and its absence for P states is reproduced consis-
tently by the data in Table III.

IV. THE HIGH-ENERGY PART

The high-energy part is given by

where relevant deﬁnitions of the symbols can be found
in Eqs. (2.18)–(2.21), and the contour CH is as shown
in Fig. 1. The high-energy part consists of the following
integration region for the virtual photon,

(4.1)

ω ∈ (En − i∞, En + i∞)
z ∈ (−i∞, i∞)

) high-energy part ∆EH .

(4.2)

The separation of the high-energy part into a subtraction
term and a remainder is accomplished as in the middle-
energy part [see Eq. (3.22)] by writing the full Dirac-
Coulomb Green function G [Eq. (2.19)] as G = GA + GB.
We deﬁne the high-energy subtraction term FHA as the
expression obtained upon substitution of the propagator
GA for G in Eq. (4.1), and a substitution of the prop-
agator GB for G in Eq. (4.1) leads to the high-energy
remainder FHB which is discussed in Sec. IV B. The sub-
traction term (including all divergent contributions) is
generated by GA, the high-energy remainder term corre-
sponds to GB. We have

∆EHA = − lim

The contribution ∆EHA corresponding to GA can be sep-
arated further into a term ∆E(1)
HA, which contains all di-
vergent contributions, and a term ∆E(2)
HA, which contains
contributions of lower order than (Zα)4, but is conver-
gent as Λ → ∞. This separation is described in detail
in [47, 50]. We have

∆EHA = ∆E(1)

HA + ∆E(2)

For the contribution F (1)

not discussed in any further detail here. The contribution
∆E(2)

The functions hi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are deﬁned in Eqs. (4.18),
(4.19) and (4.21) in [47] (see also Eq. (3.6) in [49]). The
evaluation of the high-energy subtraction term proceeds
as outlined in [47–49], albeit with an increased accu-
racy and improved calculational methods in intermediate
steps of the calculation in order to overcome the severe
numerical cancellations in the low-Z region. We recover
F (2)
HA as the sum

F (2)
HA(nlj, Zα) = h1(nlj, Zα) + h2(nlj, Zα)

+h3(nlj, Zα) + h4(nlj, Zα) .

(4.12)

The scaled function FHA(nlj, Zα) [see also Eqs. (2.26)
and (2.28)] is given by

the contributions F (1)

HA(nlj, Zα) and
The limits of
F (2)
HA(nlj, Zα) as (Zα) → 0 have been investigated
in [47, 49, 50]. For the contribution F (1)
HA(nlj, 0), the re-
sult can be found in Eq. (3.5) in [49]. The limits of the
functions hi(nlj, Zα) (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) as Zα → 0 are given
as a function of the atomic state quantum numbers in
Eq. (3.8) in [49]. For the scaled high-energy subtraction
term FHA, the limits read (see Eq. (3.9) in [49])

Therefore, the explicit forms of the limits for the states

FHA(2S1/2, Zα) = −1.423 054 + O(Zα) ,

B. The High-Energy Remainder

In the last line of Eq. (4.18), we implicitly deﬁne the

The remainder term in the high-energy part involves
the propagator GB deﬁned in Eq. (2.39), GB = G − GA,
where G is deﬁned in (2.19) and GA is given in (2.38).
The energy shift is

energy integration is evaluated with the aid of the sub-

z → i u

where

u =

t − t(cid:19) .

(4.17)

In analogy with the middle-energy subtraction and
remainder terms discussed in Secs. III B and III C
[see especially Eqs. (3.26) and (3.31)], the functions
MHB(x2, x1, z) and SHB(r, y, z) and the terms THB,|κ| are
deﬁned implicitly in the following:

The only substantial diﬀerence from the treatment of the
middle-energy remainder lies in the prefactor generated
by the parameterization of the complex photon energy
given in Eq. (4.17). The photon angular functions Aκ
and Aij
κ (i, j = 1, 2) for the high-energy part are deﬁned
in Eq. (5.8) of Ref. [47] and in Eq. (4.3) in [49] for an
arbitrary bound state. Special formulas for the ground
state can be found in Eq. (5.9) of Ref. [47]. The func-
tions Aκ and Aij
κ are not identical to the photon angular
functions for the infrared and middle-energy parts Aij
κ
(i, j = 1, 2) which are used for the low-energy part of the
calculation in Sec. III. It might be worth mentioning that
in [46–49], both the functions Aij
κ are denoted
by the symbol Aij
κ . It is clear from the context which of
the functions is employed in each case.

With these deﬁnitions, the high-energy remainder can be
rewritten as

∆EHB =

∆EHB =

(Zα)4
n3 FHB(nlj, Zα) .

(4.21)

For the high-energy remainder FHB, the limits as Zα → 0
read [see Eq. (4.15) in [49]]

FHB(nlj, Zα) =

(4.22)

For the atomic states under investigation, this leads to

FHB(1S1/2, Zα) = −0.093 457 + O(Zα) ,
FHB(2S1/2, Zα) = −0.023 364 + O(Zα) ,
FHB(2P1/2, Zα) = 0.014 538 + O(Zα) ,

FHB(2P3/2, Zα) = −0.042 315 + O(Zα) .

(4.23)

The integration procedure for the high-energy part is
adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, a crude
estimate is found for the dependence of the function SHB
deﬁned in Eq. (4.18) on its arguments. The consider-
ations leading to this estimate are analogous to those
outlined in Sec. III A for the infrared part. The result is
the approximate expression

e−y exp(cid:20)−(cid:18) 1
a t −

1

2(cid:19) (1 − r) y(cid:21)

(4.24)

for SHB. This leads naturally to the deﬁnition

qHB = 1 +(cid:18) 1
a t −

1

2(cid:19) (1 − r) ,

(4.25)

so that the (approximate) dependence of SHB on the ra-
dial variable at large y is exp (−qHB y). Note that qHB
may assume large values (≫ 1) as t → 0; this is unlike
the analogous quantity

that the convergence of this series near r = 1 can be ac-
celerated very eﬃciently using the combined nonlinear-
condensation transformation [10] applied to the series
k=0 tk where tk = THB,k+1 [see Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27)].
We ﬁrst transform this series into an alternating series
by a condensation transformation due to Van Wijngaar-
den [55, 56],

P∞

1 +(cid:18) c
a −

1

2(cid:19) (1 − r)

in the infrared and the middle-energy part, where |c| =
|√1 − z2| < 1 because z ∈ (0, En). Having identiﬁed the
leading exponential asymptotic behavior of the integrand
SHB, it is rather straightforward to evaluate the three-
dimensional integral in Eq. (4.20) by Gauss-Laguerre and
Gauss-Legendre quadrature [5] [the scaling parameter a
is deﬁned in Eqs. (3.9) and (3.14)]. The numerical results
for the high-energy remainder function FHB are found in
Table IV. These results are consistent with the limits in
Eq. (4.23).

We now turn to a brief discussion of the convergence
acceleration techniques used in the evaluation of the func-
tion SHB deﬁned in Eq. (4.18). The angular momen-
tum decomposition of SHB gives rise to a sum over the
terms THB,|κ| [see the last line of Eq. (4.18)], where |κ|
represents the modulus of the Dirac angular momentum
quantum number of the virtual intermediate state.
In
shorthand notation, and suppressing the arguments, we
have

where

(4.29)

We then accelerate the convergence of the alternating se-
j=0(−1)j Aj by applying the nonlinear delta trans-
form δ(0)
n (1, S0), which is discussed extensively in [57].
The explicit formula for this transformation is given by
deﬁning

Sn =

as the nth partial sum of the Van Wijngaarden trans-
formed input series. The delta transform reads [see

The radial Green function GB = GB(ry/a, y/a, z) in co-
ordinate space needs to be evaluated at the radial argu-
ments r y/a and y/a (where 0 < r < 1), and at the energy
argument z = En − ω = i/2 (t−1 − t) [see Eq. (4.18)]. A
crucial role is played by the ratio r of the two radial ar-
guments. Indeed, for |κ| → ∞, we have [see Eq. (4.7)
in [48]]

THB,|κ| =

r2 |κ|

|κ| (cid:20)const. + O(cid:18) 1

|κ|(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(4.27)

where “const.” is independent of |κ| and depends only on
r, y and t. The series in Eq. (4.26) is slowly convergent
for r close to one, and the region near r = 1 is known to
be problematic in numerical evaluations. Additionally,
note that the region at r = 1 is more important at low
Z than at high Z. This is because the function SHB, for
constant y, depends on r roughly as exp [−y (1 − r)/(a t)]
[see Eq. (4.24)], where a = 2 (Zα)/n + O[(Zα)3]. For
small Z, the Bohr radius 1/(Zα) of the hydrogenlike
system is large compared to high-Z systems, which em-
phasizes the region near r = 1. In this region, the se-
ries in (4.26) is very slowly convergent. We have found

15

where

Bj = (−1)j Aj .

(4.32)

The convergence acceleration proceeds by calculating a
sequence of transforms δ(0)
n in increasing transformation
order n. It is observed that the transforms converge much
faster than the partial sums Sn deﬁned in Eq. (4.30). The
upper index zero in Eq. (4.31) indicates that the trans-
formation is started with the ﬁrst term A0.

The combined transformation (combination of the con-
densation transformation and the Weniger transforma-
tion) was found to be applicable to a wide range of slowly
convergent monotone series (series whose terms have the
same sign), and many examples for its application were
given in Ref. [10]. For the numerical treatment of radia-
tive corrections in low-Z systems, the transformation has
the advantage of removing the principal numerical diﬃ-
culties associated with the slow convergence of angular
momentum decompositions of the propagators near their
singularity for equal radial arguments.

In a typical case, suﬃcient precision (10−11) in the
convergence of the sum in Eq. (4.26) is reached in a

transformation order n < 100 for the nonlinear trans-
formation δ(0)
n (1, S0), a region in which the nonlinear se-
quence transformation δ is numerically stable. Although
the delta transformation exhibits considerable numeri-
cal stability in higher transformation orders [10, 57], in-
evitable round-oﬀ errors start to accumulate signiﬁcantly
in an excessively high transformation order of n ≈ 500
in a typical case [5], and this situation is avoided in the
current evaluation because the transforms exhibit appar-
ent convergence to the required accuracy before numer-
ical round-oﬀ errors accumulate. Note that evaluation
of the condensed series Aj in Eq. (4.29) entails sam-
pling of terms THB,|κ| for rather large |κ|, while elimi-
nating the necessity of evaluating all terms THB,|κ| up
to the maximum index. The highest angular momentum
|κ| encountered in the present calculation is in excess
of 4 000 000. However, even in extreme cases less than
3 000 evaluations of particular terms of the original se-
ries are required. The computer time for the evaluation
of the slowly convergent angular momentum expansion
near the singularity is reduced by roughly three orders
of magnitude by the use of the convergence acceleration
methods.

In certain parameter regions (e.g. for large energy of
the virtual photon), a number of terms of the input series
tk have to be skipped before the convergence acceleration
algorithm deﬁned in Eqs. (4.28)–(4.32) can be applied (in
order to avoid transient behavior of the ﬁrst few terms
in the sum over κ). In this case, the input data for the
combined nonlinear-condensation transformation are the
terms tk = THB,k+1+κs, where κs denotes the number of
terms which are directly summed before the transforma-
tion is applied. These issues and further details regarding
the application of the convergence acceleration method to
QED calculations can be found in Appendix H.2 of [5].

V. COMPARISON TO ANALYTIC

CALCULATIONS

The numerical results for the scaled self-energy func-
tion F (nlj, Zα) deﬁned in Eq. (2.1) are given in Table V,
together with the results for the nonperturbative self-
energy remainder function GSE(nlj, Zα), which is im-
plicitly deﬁned in Eq. (2.2). Results are provided for
K- and L-shell states. The results here at Z = 5 are
consistent with and much more precise than the best
previous calculation [46]. The numerical results for the
self-energy remainder GSE are obtained by subtracting
the analytic lower-order terms listed in Eq. (2.2) from
the complete numerical result for the scaled self-energy
function F (nlj, Zα). No additional ﬁtting is performed.
Analytic and numerical results at low Z can be com-
pared by considering the self-energy remainder function
GSE. Note that an inconsistency in any of the ana-
lytically obtained lower-order terms would be likely to
manifest itself in a grossly inconsistent dependence of
GSE(nlj, Zα) on its argument Zα; this is not observed.
For S states, the following analytic model for GSE is
commonly assumed, which is motivated in part by a
renormalization-group analysis [58] and is constructed in
analogy with the pattern of the analytic coeﬃcients Aij
in Eq. (2.2) and (2.3)

∆GSE(Zα) = ∆A60 + (Zα) ∆A70

+(Zα)2 (cid:2)∆A82 ln2(Zα)−2
+∆A81 ln(Zα)−2 + ∆A80 + o(Zα)(cid:3) .

In order to detect possible inconsistencies in the numer-
ical and analytic data for GSE, we diﬀerence the data
for ∆GSE, i.e., we consider the following ﬁnite diﬀerence
approximation to the derivative of the function ∆GSE:

(5.5)

(5.6)

We denote

g(Z) = ∆GSE((Z + 1) α) − ∆GSE(Zα) .
the analytic and numerical

and ∆A(nu)

limits of
∆GSE(Zα) as Zα → 0 as ∆A(an)
60 , respec-
tively, and leave open the possibility of an inconsistency
between numerical and analytic data by keeping ∆A(nu)
and ∆A(an)
as distinct variables. In order to illustrate
how a discrepancy could be detected by investigating the
function g(Z), we consider special cases of the function
∆GSE(Zα) and g(Z). We have for Z = 0, which is de-
termined exclusively by analytic results,

60

60

60

∆GSE(0) = ∆A(an)
60

,

(5.7)

whereas for Z = 1, which is determined by numerical
data,

∆GSE(α) = ∆A(nu)

60 + α [∆A70 + o(α)] ,

(5.8)

GSE(nS1/2, Zα) = A60(nS1/2)

and for Z = 2,

+(Zα) (cid:2)A71(nS1/2) ln(Zα)−2 + A70(nS1/2)(cid:3)
+(Zα)2 (cid:2)A83(nS1/2) ln3(Zα)−2

+A82(nS1/2) ln2(Zα)−2

∆GSE(2α) = ∆A(nu)

60 + α [2 ∆A70 + o(α)] ,

(5.9)

etc. Hence for Z = 0, we have
g(0) = ∆GSE(α) − ∆GSE(0)
= ∆A(nu)

60 − ∆A(an)

60 + α [∆A70 + o(Zα)] .

(5.1)

(5.10)

+A81(nS1/2) ln(Zα)−2 + A80(nS1/2)(cid:3) .

The (probably nonvanishing) A83 coeﬃcient, which intro-
duces a triple logarithmic singularity at Zα = 0, hinders
an accurate comparison of numerical and analytic data
for GSE. A somewhat less singular behavior is expected
of the diﬀerence

∆GSE(Zα) = GSE(2S1/2, Zα) − GSE(1S1/2, Zα) , (5.2)
because the leading logarithmic coeﬃcients in any given
order of Zα are generally assumed to be equal for all S
states, which would mean in particular

A71(1S1/2) = A71(2S1/2) and

A83(1S1/2) = A83(2S1/2) .

(5.3)

Now we deﬁne ∆Akl as the diﬀerence of the values of the
analytic coeﬃcients for the two lowest S states:

∆Akl = Akl(2S1/2) − Akl(1S1/2) .

(5.4)

The function ∆GSE deﬁned in Eq. (5.2) can be as-
sumed to have the following semi-analytic expansion
about Zα = 0:

17

For Z = 1, the value of g is determined solely by numer-
ical data,

g(1) = ∆GSE(2α) − ∆GSE(α)

= α [∆A70 + o(Zα)] ,

(5.11)

and for Z = 2, we have

g(2) = ∆GSE(3α) − ∆GSE(2α)

= α [∆A70 + o(Zα)] .

(5.12)

Analogous equations hold for Z > 2. The analytic and
the numerical data from Table V lead to the ﬁve values
g(0), g(1), g(2), g(3), and g(4). A plot of the function
g(Z) serves two purposes: First, the values g(1), . . . , g(4)
should exhibit apparent convergence to some limiting
value α ∆A70 as Z → 0, and this can be veriﬁed by in-
spection of the plot. Secondly, a discrepancy between the
analytic and numerical approaches would result in a non-
vanishing value for ∆A(nu)
60 which would appear
as an inconsistency between the trend in the values of
g(1), . . . , and g(4) and the value of g(0) [see Eq. (5.10)].

FIG. 4. Plot of the function g(Z) deﬁned in Eq. (5.6) in
the region of low nuclear charge. For the evaluation of the
data point at Z = 0, a value of A60(1S1/2) = −30.924 15(1)
is employed [4, 15, 59].

Among the separate evaluations of A60 for the ground
state, the result in [15] has the smallest quoted uncer-
tainty. In Fig. 4 we display a plot of g(Z) for low nu-
clear charge Z. A value of A60(1S1/2) = A(an)
60 (1S1/2) =
−30.92415(1) [4, 15, 59] is used in Fig. 4. The results in-
dicate very good agreement between the numerical and
analytic approaches to the Lamb shift in the low-Z re-
gion up to the level of a few Hz in frequency units for the
low-lying atomic states (where n is the principal quan-
tum number). The error bars represent the numerical
uncertainty of the values in Table V, which correspond
to an uncertainty on the level of 1.0× Z 4 Hz in frequency
units.

Analytic work on the correction A60 has extended over
three decades [15, 34–37]. The complication arises that
although the calculations are in general analytic, some re-
maining one-dimensional integrations could not be evalu-
ated analytically because of the nature of the integrands
[see e.g. Eq. (6.96) in [15]]. Therefore a step-by-step com-
parison of the analytic calculations is diﬃcult. An addi-
tional diﬃculty is the isolation of those analytic terms
which contribute in a given order in Zα, i.e., the isola-
tion of only those terms which contribute to A60. The
apparent consistency of the numerical and analytic data
in Fig. 4 represents an independent consistency check on
the rather involved analytic calculations.

FIG. 5.

Comparison of numerical data and analyti-
cally evaluated higher-order binding corrections for the 2P1/2
state. We plot the function g1/2(Z) deﬁned in Eq. (5.15) in
the region of low Z. The numerical data obtained in the cur-
rent investigation appear to be consistent with the analytic
result of A60(2P1/2) = −0.998 91(1) obtained in [16].

Our numerical results are not inconsistent with the an-

alytic result [6] for a higher-order logarithm,

A71 = π (cid:18) 139

64 − ln 2(cid:19) = 4.65,

(5.13)

although they do not necessarily conﬁrm it. As in [4],
we obtain as an estimate A71 = 5.5(1.0) (from the ﬁt to
the numerical data for both S states). Logarithmic terms
corresponding to the (probably) nonvanishing A83 coef-
ﬁcient should be taken into account for a consistent ﬁt
of the corrections to GSE. These highly singular terms
are diﬃcult to handle with a numerical ﬁtting procedure.
The terms A83, A82 and A81 furnish three more free pa-
rameters for the numerical ﬁt, where only ﬁve data points
are available (in addition to the quantities A60, A71 and
A70, which may also be regarded as free parameters for
the ﬁtting procedure). The determination of A60 by a ﬁt
from the numerical data is much more stable than the de-
termination of the logarithmic correction A71. We brieﬂy
note that our all-order evaluation essentially eliminates
the uncertainty due to the unknown higher-order ana-
lytic terms. Also, it is interesting to note that the same
numerical methods are employed for both the S and P
states in our all-order (in Zα) calculation, whereas the
analytic treatment of S and P states diﬀers [15, 16].

The comparison of numerical and analytic results is
much less problematic for P states, because the function
GSE is less singular [see Eqs. (2.4) and (2.6)]. For the 2P
states, we observe that the function GSE(2Pj, Zα) has
the same semi-analytic expansion about Zα = 0 as the
function ∆GSE(Zα) deﬁned for S states in Eq. (5.2). We
have

GSE(2Pj, Zα) = A60(2Pj) + (Zα) A70(2Pj)

+(Zα)2 (cid:2)A82(2Pj) ln2(Zα)−2
+A81(2Pj) ln(Zα)−2 + A80(2Pj) + o(Zα)(cid:3) . (5.14)
gj(Z) = GSE(2Pj, (Z + 1) α) − GSE(2Pj, Zα)

Hence, we plot the function

(5.15)

for j = 1/2 and j = 3/2 in the region of low Z, with the
notion that an inconsistent analytic result for A60(2Pj)
would lead to irregularity at Z = 0, in analogy with the
S states. The numerical data shown in Figs. 5, and 6
appear to be consistent with the analytic results of

A60(2P1/2) = −0.998 91(1) and
A60(2P3/2) = −0.503 37(1)

(5.16)

obtained in [16].
In this context it may be interesting
to note that analytic results obtained in [16, 52] for the
higher-order binding corrections to 2P, 3P, and 4P states
have recently been conﬁrmed indirectly [60]. Finally, al-
though it may be possible to obtain more accurate esti-
mates of some higher-order analytic corrections, notably
the A70 coeﬃcient for P states and ∆A70 for the two
lowest-lying S states, we have not made such an analysis
in the current work; we have restricted the discussion to
a check of the consistency with the available results for
A60.

FIG. 6. For the 2P3/2 state, we plot the function g3/2(Z)
deﬁned in Eq. (5.15) in the region of low Z. The numerical
data obtained in the current investigation appear to be con-
sistent with the analytic result of A60(2P3/2) = −0.503 37(1)
from [16].

two-body corrections at low Z and the comparison of an-
alytic and numerical results [58,61–72]. Traditionally, the
self-energy correction for hydrogenlike systems has posed
a computational challenge. Here we have described a
nonperturbative evaluation of the one-photon self-energy
correction in hydrogenlike ions with low nuclear charge
numbers Z = 1 to 5. The general outline of our approach
is discussed in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the numerical evalua-
tion of the low-energy part (generated by virtual photons
of low energy) is described. In Sec. IV, we discuss the nu-
merical evaluation of the high-energy part, which is gen-
erated by high-energy virtual photons and contains the
formally inﬁnite contributions, which are removed by the
renormalization. Sec. IV also contains a brief discussion
of the convergence acceleration methods as employed in
the current evaluation. We discuss in Sec. V the com-
parison of analytic and numerical data for K- and L-shell
states in the region of low Z. The main results of this
paper are contained in Table V: numerical data, non-
perturbative in Zα, for the scaled self-energy function F
and the self-energy remainder function GSE for K- and
L-shell states at low nuclear charge. The numerical ac-
curacy of our data is 1 Hz or better in frequency units
for 1S, 2S and both 2P states in atomic hydrogen.

The comparison of analytic and numerical results to
the level of accuracy of the numerical data, which is dis-
cussed in Sec. V, indicates that there is very good agree-
ment for the K- and L-shell states. The analytic and
numerical data are shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6. Our all-
order evaluation eliminates any uncertainty due to the
unknown higher-order analytic terms; the current numer-
ical uncertainty in the self energy is at the level of 1 Hz
for atomic hydrogen.

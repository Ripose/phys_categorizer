Abstract

A detailed study of the low-lying electronic states 1Σ, 3Σ, 3Π, 3∆ of the HeH+ molecular ion in

parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration (when α-particle and proton are situated on the same

magnetic line) is carried out for B = 0 − 4.414 × 1013 G in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

The variational method is employed using a physically adequate trial function. It is shown that

the parallel conﬁguration is stable with respect to small deviations for Σ-states. The quantum

numbers of the ground state depend on the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The ground state evolves from

the spin-singlet 1Σ state for small magnetic ﬁelds B . 0.5 a.u. to the spin-triplet 3Σ unbound state

for intermediate ﬁelds and to the spin-triplet strongly bound 3Π state for B & 15 a.u. When the

HeH+ molecular ion exists, it is stable with respect to a dissociation.

INTRODUCTION

It is well-known that a very strong magnetic ﬁeld may appear on the surface of neutron

stars, B ≈ 1011 − 1013 G. It seems natural to expect that in a vicinity of the surface some

atomic and molecular systems can occur. For many years this assumption has motivated a

development of atomic-molecular physics in a strong magnetic ﬁeld hoping that it might lead

to understanding of the spectra of these compact stars and be important for a construction

of a model of the atmosphere. Recent revolutionary observation of the absorption features

in a spectra of the isolated neutron star 1E1207.4-5209 by Chandra X-ray observatory [1]

brought an extra attention to the ﬁeld.

So far, a major attention has been paid to a study of one-electron atomic and molecular

systems (for a review, see [2]). During the last years the existence of several exotic, strongly

bound one-electron molecular systems has been predicted. In particular, it was shown that

for a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld B & 5 × 1012 G the exotic ion (HeH)2+ can exist

in parallel conﬁguration (the magnetic ﬁeld is directed along internuclear axis) as optimal

as well as its excited states 1π, 1δ [3]. A complete list of possible one-electron atomic and

molecular systems is known for B . Bschwinger = 4.414 × 1013 G. In turn, the exploration of
two-electron systems has been mostly restricted to a study of atomic-type systems H−, He

with the only exception of the H2 molecule (see [4], [5] and references therein). Recently,
a ﬁrst detailed study of the molecular ions H+

[7] has been carried out (for a

3 [6] and He2+

brief review of a general situation see [8]). It was shown that for large magnetic ﬁelds if such

an ion exists its optimal conﬁguration is the linear parallel one - heavy charged particles are

situated along a magnetic line. A goal of the present paper is to make a study of the Coulomb

system (αpee) in a magnetic ﬁeld ranging in B = 0−4.414×1013 G and thus to establish the
possible existence of the simplest two-electron diatomic heteronuclear molecular ion HeH+

and to explore its lowest excited states. In the ﬁeld-free case the theoretical existence of

HeH+ was established long ago by Beach [9] (see also [10]) while its several excited states

were found (see, e.g., [11]). Experimentally, this molecular ion was ﬁrst observed in the mass
spectra of helium-hydrogen mixtures (see, e.g., [12]). The HeH+ ion is thought to be among

the ﬁrst molecular species to appear in the Universe (see [13] and references therein). An
attempt to explore the HeH+ ion in ultra-strong magnetic ﬁeld was made in [14].

Atomic units are used throughout (~=me=e=1), although energies are expressed in Ry-

2

dbergs (Ry). The magnetic ﬁeld B is given in a.u. with B0 = 2.35 × 109 G.

II. GENERALITIES

We study the system (αpee) placed in a uniform constant magnetic ﬁeld. It is assumed

that the α-particle and proton are inﬁnitely massive (Born-Oppenheimer approximation of

zero order). It seems natural from physical point of view that the optimal conﬁguration is

parallel when the α-particle and proton are situated along the magnetic ﬁeld line. Never-

theless a stability of this conﬁguration with respect to small perturbations will be checked.

The Hamiltonian which describes the system (αpee) when the magnetic ﬁeld is oriented

along the z direction, B = (0, 0, B) is

The problem is characterized by two conserved quantities: (i) the operator of the z-

component of the total angular momentum (projection of the angular momentum on the

magnetic ﬁeld direction) giving rise to the magnetic quantum number m and (ii) the operator

of the z-component of the total spin (projection of the total spin on the magnetic ﬁeld

direction) giving rise to the spin quantum number ms. Hence, any eigenstate has two

quantum numbers assigned: the magnetic quantum number m and the spin quantum number

ms.

The α-particle and the proton (marked by bullets) are situated on the z-line at distance R.

As the magnetic ﬁeld increases a contribution from the linear Zeeman term (interaction

of the spin with a magnetic ﬁeld B · S) becomes more and more important. Hence, it is

natural to assume that for large magnetic ﬁelds the states with minimal ms (when both

electron spins are antiparallel to the magnetic ﬁeld) will represent the states with lowest

total energies.

The space of eigenstates is split into subspaces (sectors) with each of them characterized

by deﬁnite values of m and ms. Thus, to classify eigenstates we follow the convention

widely accepted in molecular physics using the quantum numbers m and ms. The notation

is 2S+1M, where 2S + 1 is the spin multiplicity and corresponds to 1 for singlet S = 0 and 3

for triplet S = 1, as for the labeling M it is used the Greek letters Σ, Π, ∆ that correspond

to the states with |m| = 0, 1, 2, ..., respectively. We study only states with m = 0, −1, −2.

As a method to explore the problem we use the variational procedure. The recipe of

choice of trial functions is based on physical arguments [15]. A trial function for states with

orbital magnetic quantum number m is chosen in the form

ψ(trial) = (1 + σeP12)ρ|m|

tively. The P12 is the operator which interchanges electrons (1 ↔ 2). The parameters α1−4,

β1−2 and γ as well as the internuclear distance R are eight variational parameters.

Calculations were performed using the minimization package MINUIT from CERN-LIB.

Multidimensional integration was carried out using a dynamical partitioning procedure: a

domain of integration was divided into subdomains following the integrand proﬁle and then

each subdomain was integrated separately (for details see, e.g., [2]). Numerical integration

was done with a relative accuracy of ∼ 10−6 − 10−7 by use of the adaptive D01FCF routine

from NAG-LIB. Computations were performed on a dual DELL PC with two Xeon processors

of 2.8 GHz each (ICN) and dual DELL PC with two Xeon processors of 3.06 GHz each

(CINVESTAV). We implemented a parallelization in the routine for the calculation of the

integrals. Minimization process for each particular magnetic ﬁeld and for a given state was

quite painful and lengthy, it took from 100 to 1000 hours of CPU time, however, when a

minimum is found it was needed a few minutes to compute a minimal variational energy.

III. RESULTS

In absence of a magnetic ﬁeld the HeH+ molecular ion exists and it is stable. Its ground
state is the 1Σ (S = 0 and m = 0) state [9]. In order to establish the existence of HeH+ in

a magnetic ﬁeld we carried out a detailed study of the Coulomb system (αpee) in parallel

conﬁguration in the state 1Σ for magnetic ﬁelds B = 0 − 10000 a.u. (see Table I). For this

case the variational trial function ψtrial (4) is used at σe = 1 and m = 0.

The calculations indicate the optimal geometry is parallel (α-particle and proton stay on

the same magnetic line). For this conﬁguration for all studied magnetic ﬁelds a minimum

in the total energy curve ET (R) is developed. Furthermore, we checked that this minimum

is stable with respect to small inclinations of the internuclear axis from the magnetic ﬁeld

direction. It is found that with an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the total energy

of the (αpee) system in the 1Σ state grows, it becomes more bound (in particular, the

double ionization energy increases EI = 2B − ET ) and the system becomes more compact

(the internuclear equilibrium distance decreases), see Table I. For B ≤ 100 a.u. the (αpee)

system in the 1Σ state is stable with respect to the dissociation He+ + H or He + p. The

vibrational and rotational energies are calculated for B = 0.5 a.u. The vibrational energy is

larger than the rotational energy which is typical for ﬁeld-free case.

We carried out a detailed study of the spin-triplet state 3Σ (S = 1 and m = 0) of the

(αpee) system in parallel conﬁguration in the domain of magnetic ﬁelds 0 ≤ B ≤ 10000 a.u.

For this state the variational trial function ψtrial (4) with σe = −1 and m = 0 is used.

Similar to 1Σ all total energy curves ET (R) of the (αpee) system for magnetic ﬁelds
B = 0 − 10000 a.u. in the 3Σ state displays a minimum. However, to the contrary to the 1Σ

state the minimum is always shallow, see Fig. 2-5 as an illustration. It is found that with

an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the total energy decreases. The system gets more

”compact” - the internuclear equilibrium distance of a shallow minimum decreases slowly,

see Table II. We expect that the system in the 3Σ state ”exists” in a form of two separated
atomic-like systems He+(1s) + H(1s) situated at large distances with electron spins directed

against a magnetic ﬁeld direction.

A comparison of the total energies of the (αpee) system in 1Σ and 3Σ states in equilibrium

indicates to the appearance of a level crossing (see Tables I and II). This crossing of the

1Σ and 3Σ states occurs at B ≈ 0.5 a.u. It implies that the 1Σ state is the lowest energy

state at B . 0.5 a.u., where the (αpee) system is stable towards possible decays. Hence,

one can conclude that the stable HeH+ molecular ion exists at B . 0.5 a.u with 1Σ state

as the ground state. For B & 0.5 a.u. the situation is changed - the 3Σ state may become
the ground state of the HeH+ molecular ion. In fact, the state 3Σ is at most metastable
with very short lifetime or very likely is simply unbound - the HeH+ ion dissociates to
He+(1s) + H(1s) with the electrons in spin-triplet state. A general conclusion can be drawn

that for 0.5 < B < 15 a.u. the system (αpee) likely exists in a form of two separate atomic-

type systems He+(1s) + H(1s) with total electron spin equal to one.

As next we carried out a detailed study of the state 3Π (S = 1 and m = −1) of the (αpee)

system in parallel conﬁguration for magnetic ﬁelds 0 ≤ B ≤ 4.414 × 1013 G (see Figs. 2-5).

For this state the same variational trial function ψtrial (4) is used at σe = −1 and m = −1.

The results of the calculations indicate unambiguously the existence of a deep minimum

in the total energy curve ET (R) of the (αpee) system in parallel conﬁguration for all studied
magnetic ﬁelds 0 ≤ B ≤ 4.414×1013 G. Hence, it can be concluded that the HeH+ molecular

ion may exist in the 3Π state. Table III contains the results for the total energy ET and
the internuclear equilibrium distance Req for the state 3Π. Perhaps, it is worth mentioning

that the previously obtained results for ultra-magnetic ﬁelds [14] are less accurate for both
studied two-electron systems: (i) the HeH+ ion in the present calculation and (ii) the He

atom in the calculation made in [17]. With an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the

total energy decreases, the system becomes more bound (double ionization energy increases

being equal for triplet states to EI = −ET ) and more compact (the internuclear equilibrium

distance decreases). Table III shows the total energies of three dissociation channels of
HeH+ in 3Π state: → He(13(−1)+) + p, → He+(1s) + H(2p−1) and → He+(2p−1) + H(1s) for
diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds. It can be seen that the state 3Π is stable towards any dissociation.

It is worth noting that the dissociation energy needed increases monotonously in all range of

studied magnetic ﬁelds. Therefore the stability of the system with a magnetic ﬁeld increases.

One can see that the crossing of the total energies of the 3Π and 3Σ states at equilibrium

occurs at B ≈ 15 a.u. For larger magnetic ﬁelds the total energy of the 3Π state is lower
than the total energy of 3Σ. Hence, the ground state for the HeH+ ion for B & 15 a.u.

realized by the 3Π state. Eventually, one can draw a conclusion that the 3Σ state is the
lowest energy state of the (αpee) system for 0.5 < B . 15 a.u. and the HeH+ ion can exist.

In order to complete the study we consider the state 3∆ (S = 1, m = −2 ) of the (αpee)

system in the domain of magnetic ﬁelds 0 ≤ B ≤ 4.414 × 1013 G. It is worth mentioning

that the state 3∆ for the ﬁeld-free case was studied in [11] and [18]. For this state the

same variational trial function ψtrial (4) is used but with σe = −1 and m = −2. For

all total energy curves ET (R) for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds the minimum is found. Hence,
the ion HeH+ may exist in 3∆ state for all magnetic ﬁelds. Table IV shows the total ET

of the magnetic ﬁeld strength the total energies decrease, the system becomes more bound

(double ionization energies increase, EI = −ET , for triplet states) and more compact (the

internuclear equilibrium distance decreases). At B ≈ 300 a.u. a crossing of the total energies

of 3Σ and 3∆ at equilibrium occurs. For larger magnetic ﬁelds the total energy of the 3∆ is

smaller than the 3Σ state. It implies that for B & 300 a.u. the 3∆ state is the lowest excited

state.

IV. CONCLUSION

The low-lying electronic states 1Σ, 3Σ, 3Π, 3∆ of the Coulomb system αpee in parallel

conﬁguration are studied for B = 0 − 4.414 × 1013 G using the variational method in the

Born-Oppenheimer approximation of the zero order. It is shown that for all studied states

and all magnetic ﬁelds the parallel conﬁguration is always optimal being stable with respect

to small inclinations. The state of the lowest total energy depends on the magnetic ﬁeld

strength. It evolves from the spin-singlet 1Σ state for small magnetic ﬁelds B . 0.5 a.u. to

spin-triplet 3Σ (unbound state) for B & 0.5 a.u. and, ﬁnally, for B & 15 a.u. to spin-triplet

bound state for magnetic ﬁelds B . 0.5 a.u. and B & 15 a.u. in a parallel conﬁguration and

it is stable. In a domain 15 . B . 300 a.u. the state having the total energy next after the

one of the ground state is the unbound (repulsive) 3Σ state. For B & 300 a.u. the 3∆ state
is the lowest excited state of the HeH+ molecular ion. As for 0.5 . B . 15 a.u. the system
(αpee) likely exists in a form of two separate atomic-type systems He+(1s) + H(1s) with

It is worth emphasizing that for B & 2000 a.u. both one- and two-electron ions (HeH)2+

and (HeH)+ can exist. As for the ion (HeH)2+ it becomes stable at B & 10000 a.u.

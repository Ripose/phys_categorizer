Improved theory of helium ﬁne structure

Improved theoretical predictions for the helium ﬁne-structure splitting of 23PJ levels are obtained by
the calculation of the higher order α5 Ry contribution. New results for transition frequencies: ν01 =
29 616 943.01(17) kHz and ν12 = 2 291 161.13(30) kHz signiﬁcantly disagree with experimental values, thus
question the possibility of the determination of the ﬁne structure constant α from a recent series of highly
accurate helium measurements.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁne-structure splitting of the helium 23PJ states is a in-
trinsically relativistic effect and arises from the interaction of
spins and orbital angular momentum. The value of this split-
ting has been measured with increasing precision over the last
years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Since it is proportional to α2 Ry, these ac-
curate measurements make helium a candidate for determin-
ing the ﬁne structure constant α, provided that the higher or-
der in α corrections can be sufﬁciently well understood. The
presently most accurate g − 2 determination of α sensitively
depends on complicated multi-loop calculations performed by
Kinoshita and by Remiddi and coworkers [6] and therefore re-
quires independent conﬁrmation. In the respond to signiﬁcant
experimental effort [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we present here the cal-
culation of the α5 Ry contribution, which aims to complete
a project initiated many years ago by Drake et al. [7] of the
accurate calculation of the helium ﬁne structure and the new
determination of α.

In the presented calculations we use natural relativistic
units with ¯h = c = ǫ0 = m = 1, so that e2 = 4 π α. The ﬁne
structure in order m α7 (α5 Ry) can be written as [8]

E(7) = hH (7)i + 2

H (4)

(E0 − H0)′ H (5)

(cid:29)

+ EL (1)

(cid:28)

where EL is the Bethe logarithmic correction of Eq. (17), and
H (i) is an effective Hamiltonian of order m αi. We obtain in
this work complete H (7), as the other parts EL and the second
order term called ES, have already been obtained in [8], and
ln α terms in [11].

The approach we use here is based on dimensionally reg-
ularized Quantum Electrodynamics. The parameter ǫ related
to the space dimension d = 3 − 2 ǫ, plays a role of both in-
frared and ultraviolet regulator, as some coefﬁcients in H (7)
and EL are divergent in d = 3 space. This artiﬁcial param-
eter ǫ is used to deﬁne various terms, and we will explicitly
demonstrate its cancellation in their sum.

H (7) consists of exchange terms and the radiative correc-
tions, where photon is emitted and absorbed by the same par-
ticle. In the following we will use a generic symbol δH for
any correction at m α7 order. Let us start the calculations from
the exchange terms. Their derivation in general is quite com-
plicated. We notice that only two-photon exchange diagrams

contribute and there are no three-body terms, what is a result
of the internal cancellation, Moreover, we calculate the terms
which are nonanalytic in α2 what leads to a simple structure of
H (7). For example H (5) (see Eq. (16)) consists of Dirac delta
δ3(r) and 1/r3 terms only, and they can be derived from the
two-photon exchange scattering amplitude. Similar holds for
the spin dependent m α7 terms. If H (7) represents an effective
Hamiltonian, it has to give the same scattering amplitude as in
the full QED. Therefore, we obtain the exchange contribution
δH from the spin dependent part of the two-photon scattering
amplitude, which is

where σij ≡ σ(i, j) = −i/2 [σi, σj ]. The 1/ǫ divergences
cancels out with the low energy part where photon momenta
are of order of binding energy. This low energy contribution

menta. Here δ denotes the ﬁrst order correction to φ, H and
E due to a spin dependent part of the Breit-Pauli Hamilto-
nian H (4), Eq. (15). The resulting correction is a sum of two
terms. The ﬁrst one contributes to hH (4)/(E0 − H0)′ H (5)i

where we omitted ln 2λ term. Together with Eq. (3) it gives
a complete contribution due to exchange terms. When calcu-
lating expectation values on 3PJ states further simpliﬁcations
can be performed. Namely, the expectation value of Dirac
delta function with both momenta on the right or on the left
hand side vanishes. Moreover, the nonrelativistic wave func-
tion is a product of symmetric spin and antisymmetric spatial
function. It means that expectation value of σ1 is equal to that
of σ2. As a result the total exchange contribution is:

The treatment of the radiative correction is different. We
argue that radiative corrections can be incorporated by the use
of electromagnetic formfactors and a Uehling correction to the

The possible additional corrections are quadratic in electro-
magnetic ﬁelds, see Ref. [10], however, terms formed out of
~E, ~B, ~p, ~σ can contribute only at higher order and thus can
be neglected. Corrections due to the slope of formfactors and
the vacuum polarization are obtained analogously to the Breit-
Pauli Hamiltonian H (4) in Eq. (15), by modifying electro-
magnetic vertices and the photon propagator. The result is

All the m α6 operators obtained by Douglas and Kroll (DK)
in [13] can also be obtained from this Hamiltonian in Eq. (13),
see Ref.[14]. The anomalous magnetic moment operators are
derived in a very similar way. They differ (see Table II) only
by multiplicative factor from the DK operators. There is one
to one correspondence with Table I of Ref. [15] with 3 ex-
ceptions. The operator H8 from our Table II canceled out in
DK calculation. The other two exceptions are related to the
different spin structure of the last but one term in Eq. (13),
what leads to operators H16 and H17 in our Table II.

Apart for Hi and Qi operators, there is a second order con-
tribution and the low energy Bethe-logarithmic type correc-
tions. They have already been considered in our former work
[8]. The second order contribution, beyond the anomalous
magnetic moment terms is:

Numerical results for all these contributions is presented in
Table III All relevant contributions to helium ﬁne structure
splitting seems to be known, therefore we are at position to
present ﬁnal theoretical predictions, see Table III. Although
we included all terms up to the order m α7 theoretical predic-
tions are in apparent disagreement with the measurements, see
the last raw of Table III . Let us analyze the possible source
of this discrepancy. The numerical calculation involves vari-
ational nonrelativistic wave function. The parameter which
controls its accuracy is the nonrelativistic energy. Our wave
function, consisting at maximum of 1500 explicitly correlated
exponential functions reproduces energy with 18 signiﬁcant
digits in agreement with the result of Drake in [9]. Matrix el-
ements with this wave function are not as accurate as nonrel-
ativistic energy, but they are sufﬁciently accurate for leading
ﬁne structure operators and results agree with more accurate
and independent calculation of Drake in [9]. In fact almost

all numerical calculations have been performed by us and by
Drake independently with few exceptions, for example, the
Bethe logarithmic contribution EL was obtained only in [8],
and this correction contributes mostly to the numerical uncer-
tainty of the theoretical predictions. More important is the
complexity of derivation of m α7 operators, namely Hi and
Qi. We derived Hi on purpose in a very similar way as D-K
operators, to avoid accidental mistakes. Whereas, Qi oper-
ators were obtained from the one-loop scattering amplitude
in almost automatic way, in contrast to the former and very
lengthy derivation of Zhang [18, 19, 20], with which we are in
disagreement, (see summary of Zhang results in Ref. [9]). In
our previous papers with Sapirstein [8, 17] we pointed several
computation mistakes and inconsistencies in Zhang’s calcula-
tions, and therefore we consider the result of Drake, see Table
III to be incomplete. While it is possible that we made some-
where a mistake, the most probably explanation of the dis-
crepancy with experiments seems to be neglection of higher
order terms, namely m α8. The ﬁrst sign of their importance
was the recoil correction to the second order contribution, ob-
tained by Drake in [9]. In spite of the small electron-alpha par-
ticle mass ratio, this correction is very signiﬁcant, for example
δν01 = −10.81 kHz. The mass ratio me/mα ≈ 0.00014 is
not much different from α2 ≈ 0.000053, therefore one can
expect that iteration of Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian in the third
order might also be signiﬁcant. Moreover, if we assume that

the ratios δ(8)ν/δ(6)ν ≈ δ(6)ν/δ(4)ν, then this estimate gives
δ(8)ν01 = 0.08 kHz, and δ(8)ν12 = 18 kHz, the last one is
clearly signiﬁcant. However, one can expect that most m α8
operators will be negligible, as E(7) is already at few kHz
level so additional power of α will make these operators much
below the experimental accuracy.

In summary the determination of α from helium spec-
troscopy requires both, checking the calculation of E(7) and
the reliable estimation of the higher order E(8) contribution,
which is a difﬁcult task and probably suspends the helium
project. Therefore it is not competitive with respect to the
determination of α from the recent experiments on the atomic
interferometry [21] and the photon recoil [22].

useful advises on evaluation of d-dimensional Feynman dia-
grams.

We investigate how the nonlinearity of the Zeeman shift for
strong magnetic ﬁelds aﬀects the dynamics of rf ﬁeld induced
evaporative cooling in magnetic traps. We demonstrate for
the 87Rb and 23Na F = 2 trapping states with wave packet
simulations how the cooling stops when the rf ﬁeld frequency
goes below a certain limit (for the 85Rb F = 2 trapping state
the problem does not appear). We examine the applicability
of semiclassical models for the strong ﬁeld case as an extension
of our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 58, 3983 (1998)]. Our
results verify many of the aspects observed in a recent 87Rb
experiment [Phys. Rev. A 60, R1759 (1999)].

I. INTRODUCTION

Bose-Einstein condensation of alkali atoms in magnetic
traps was ﬁrst observed in 1995 [1], and since then the de-
velopment in related research has been been very swift.
Typically the hyperﬁne state used in the alkali exper-
iments is the F = 1 state, although condensation has
been demonstrated for the 87Rb F = 2 case as well [2].
The trapping of atoms is based on moderate, spatially in-
homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds, which create a parabolic,
spin-state dependent potential for spin-polarised atoms,
as shown in Fig. 1(a). For slowly moving atoms the trap-
ping potential depends on the strength of the magnetic
ﬁeld B but not on its direction [3]. In practice the ﬁeld
is dominated by a constant bias ﬁeld ~Bbias, which elimi-
nates the Majorana spin ﬂips at the center of the trap.

In evaporative cooling the hottest atoms are removed
from the trap and the remaining ones thermalise by in-
elastic collisions. This leads to a decrease in temperature
of the atoms remaining in the trap [4–6]. Continuous
evaporative cooling requires adjustable separation into
cold and hot atoms. This is achieved by inducing spin
ﬂips with an oscillating (radiofrequency) magnetic ﬁeld,
which rotates preferably in the plane perpendicular to the
bias ﬁeld [6,7]. In the limit of linear (weak) Zeeman ef-
fect the rf ﬁeld couples the adjacent magnetic states MF
resonantly at the spatial location determined by the ﬁeld
frequency [Fig. 1(a)]. Hot atoms oscillating in the trap
can reach the resonance point and exit the trap after a
spin ﬂip to a nontrapping state. Using the rotating wave
approximation we can eliminate the rf ﬁeld oscillations,
and obtain the curve crossing description of resonances
[Fig. 1(b)].

FIG. 1. The magnetic trap potentials for spin-polarised
87Rb (F = 2). (a) The spin ﬂips that lead to evaporation are
achieved by an rf ﬁeld induced multistate transition at a spe-
ciﬁc spatial distance from the trap center. Here B0 = 0.0001
T. (b) In the curve crossing description the resonances appear
as degeneracies. Here B0 = 0.0001 T. (c) For strong ﬁelds the
multistate crossing transforms into a sequence on two-state
crossings between adjacent MF states. Here B0 = 0.0020 T.
The circles mark those crossings where the involved adjacent
MF states are also coupled. In (b) and (c) we have νrf = 0.25
MHz+ν0.

The dynamics of atoms as they move past the reso-
nance point can be described with a simple semiclassical
model [8], which has been shown to agree very well with
fully quantum wave packet calculations [3]. The model,
however, can be applied only if the resonances between
adjacent MF states occur at the exactly same distance
from the trap center. When the nonlinear terms domi-
nate the Zeeman shifts, the situation changes, as shown
in Fig. 1(c). The adjacent resonances become separated
and one expects to treat the evaporation as a sequence
of independent Landau-Zener crossings as suggested by
Desruelle et al. in connection with their recent 87Rb ex-
periment [9]. We show that there is an intermediate re-
gion where oﬀ-resonant two-photon transitions from the
MF = 2 state to the MF = 0 state, demonstrated in
Fig. 2, play a relevant role.

In general there is a competition between the adiabatic

1

H = A~I · ~J + CJz + DIz,

(1)

where ~I and ~J are the operators for the nuclear and to-
tal electronic angular momentum, respectively. The ﬁrst
term describes the hyperﬁne coupling; Ehf = hνhf = 2A,
where Ehf is the hyperﬁne splitting between the F = 1
and F = 2 states. Here νhf = 1772 MHz for 23Na and
νhf = 6835 MHz for 87Rb.

The magnetic ﬁeld dependence arises from the two
other terms, with C = gJ µBB and D = −αµN B, where
the Bohr magneton is µB = e¯h/2me, the nuclear mag-
neton is µN = e¯h/2mp, and the Lande factor is gJ = 2.
Here α = 2.218 for 23Na and α = 2.751 for 87Rb. But
µB/µN ∼ 1000, and in fact we can omit the third term
in Eq. (1).

For 23Na and 87Rb we have I = 3/2 and J = 1/2 (lead-
ing to F = 1 or F = 2 with ~F = ~I + ~J). Our state basis
is formed by the angular momentum states labelled with
the magnetic quantum number pairs (MI , MJ ). When
we evaluate the matrix elements of H [using the relation
~I · ~J = IzJz + 1
2 (I+J−+I−J+)], the states that correspond
to the same value of MF = MI + MJ form subsets of mu-
tually coupled states. By diagonalising the Hamiltonian
we obtain its eigenstates. The states which correspond
to the F = 2 state in the B → 0 limit (labelled with MF )
have the energies EMF:

4A2 + 2AC + C2 − A,

These energies have been normalised to the energy of the
F = 2 state for B = 0. In Fig. 3(a) and (b) we show the
Zeeman shifts for all hyperﬁne ground states of 23Na and
87Rb, but normalised to the ground state energy in the
absence of hyperﬁne structure. For small magnetic ﬁelds
(B ≪ 1 T) we get

EMF ≃ Ehf [εMF + (4 − M 2

F )ε2],

(3)

where ε = µBB/(2Ehf ).
In terms of F and MF the
linear Zeeman shift is EMF = gF µBBMF = Ehf εMF as
the hyperﬁne Lande factor is gF = 1/2.

The necessary condition for evaporation is that the rf
ﬁeld induces a resonance between the states MF = 2 and
MF = 1. The location of this resonance deﬁnes the divi-
sion between the hot and cold atoms. By decreasing the
rf ﬁeld frequency νrf we both move the resonance point
closer to the trap center as well as allow more atoms to
escape the trap. For small B ﬁelds all adjacent states are
resonant at the same location for any νrf . But in case of

states (dotted lines) for 23Na at B0 = 0.0010 T, with rf ﬁeld
coupling Ω = (2π)20 kHz. The arrow indicates the semia-
diabatic process for transfer from the MF = 2 state to the

an oﬀ-resonant two-photon transition.

following of the eigenstates (solid lines in Fig. 2), which
leads to evaporation, and nonadiabatic transitions which
force the atoms to stay in the trapping states. In 23Na
the nonadiabatic transitions can lead to highly inelastic
collisions [3].

In the experiment by Desruelle et al. it was found that
for a strong bias ﬁeld the nonlinear Zeeman shifts remove
some resonances completely, thus making it impossible to
make a spin ﬂip to a nontrapping state. Our calculations
conﬁrm this observation. We also show that although
evaporation could continue via oﬀ-resonant multiphoton
processes, such a process is not practical. The stopping
of evaporation at some ﬁnite temperature occurs for the
87Rb and 23Na F = 2 trapping states, but not e.g. for
the 85Rb F = 2 trapping state.

In Sec. II we write down the formalism for the Zee-
man shifts and show the basic properties of the ﬁeld-
dependent trapping potentials. We describe the fully
quantum wave packet approach and corresponding semi-
classical theories in Sec. III, present and discuss the re-
sults in Sec. IV, and summarize our work in Sec. V.

II. THE ZEEMAN STRUCTURE

A. 23Na and 87Rb

The Zeeman shifts can not be derived properly in
the basis of the hyperﬁne states (labelled by F and
MF ) [10–12]. We need to consider the atom-ﬁeld Hamil-
tonian in the (I, J) basis:

in our wave packet studies).

practical reasons we have chosen to modify B rather than
νrf
In Fig. 5(a) we show
the potential conﬁguration when νrf is slightly below νcr.
Since νcr corresponds to the state separation at the center
of the trap, it is independent of the trap parameters such
as the trap frequency.

For a speciﬁc trap conﬁguration νcr can be converted
into a minimum kinetic energy required for reaching the
resonance between the states MF = 2 and MF = 1. In
Fig. 5(b) we show this minimum kinetic energy in units of
temperature as a function of magnetic ﬁeld strength for
23Na and 87Rb, and for the trap conﬁguration used both
in our simulations and in the experiment by Desruelle et
al. [9].

FIG. 3. The Zeeman shifts for the ground state hyperﬁne
states of (a) 23Na, (b) 87Rb and (c) 85Rb. Note that the situ-
ations considered in this paper take place in a region located
very close to B = 0 in the scale of these pictures.

strong magnetic ﬁelds, typically larger than about 0.0002
T, due to the nonlinear Zeeman shifts the resonances
separate. Furthermore, the other resonances than the
MF = 2 − MF = 1 one in fact move towards the trap
center faster, and reach it while the MF = 2 − MF = 1
resonance still corresponds to some ﬁnite temperature.
When νrf is lowered further, the other resonances begin
to disappear. At strong B ﬁelds the MF = 0 state is
also a trapping state, as shown in Fig. 4, so for eﬀective
evaporation one really needs to reach the MF = −1 state.

FIG. 4. The MF = 0 state becomes a trapping state very
quickly as B increases. Here we show as an example the situa-
tion for 23Na when B0 = 0.0010 T. The oscillation frequency
for this state is naturally much smaller than for the other
trapping states.

At the critical frequency νcr the crossing between the
states MF = −1 and MF = 0 disappears. Alternatively,
for a ﬁxed frequency νrf we have a critical value Bcr for
the B ﬁeld; the resonances disappear when B >
∼ Bcr (for

FIG. 5. (a) For B = 0.00155 T and νrf =0.25 MHz+ν0
the resonance between the MF = 0 and MF = −1 states for
23Na can not be achieved (Bcr = 0.00152 T). The possibil-
ity for a tunnelling-like transfer (which could also be called
oﬀ-resonant process via power broadening) exists, though. (b)

In the intermediate region 0 ≪ B <

∼ Bcr, where the

necessary crossings exist but are separated, the processes
take place via two possible routes. We can have oﬀ-
resonant multiphoton processes, that e.g. lead to adia-
batic transfer from the MF = 2 state to the MF = 0
state. This example is demonstrated in Fig. 2 where we
show also the eigenstates of the system, i.e., the ﬁeld-
dressed potentials. When the relevant resonances are
well separated, the evaporation takes place via a com-
plicated sequence of crossings, as indicated in Fig. 1(c).
This will be demonstrated with wave packet simulations
in Sec. IV.

B. 85Rb

For the isotope 85Rb we have I = 5/2 and J = 1/2, so
the ground state hyperﬁne states are F = 2 and F = 3,
as shown in Fig. 3(c). Now the F = 2 trapping state is
the lower hyperﬁne ground state. Thus the behavior of
the MF states is diﬀerent from the 87Rb and 23Na case.

where now Ehf = 3A. For 85Rb we have νhf = 3036
MHz. Here the trapping states are now F = 2, M = −2
and F = 2, M = −1.
If we now deﬁne ˜ε = (2/3)ε =
µBB/(3Ehf ) we get approximatively

EMF ≃ −Ehf [˜εMF + (9 − M 2

F )˜ε2].

(5)

As gF = −1/3, this agrees with the linear expression
EMF = gF µBBMF = −Ehf ˜εMF .

The change of order in the MF state energy ladder
means that with increasing B ﬁeld one never loses the
crossing points between the adjacent states.
In other
words, if we use an rf ﬁeld that can couple the states
MF = −2 and MF = −1 resonantly at some location xC ,
then we always couple the rest of the states resonantly
as well at distances larger than xC . In Fig. 6 we see how
this leads to a sequence of crossings that allows hot atoms
to leave the trap without the need for sloshing. One
must, however, take into account that the kinetic energy
required to leave the trap is now set by the diﬀerence
between the energy of the MF = −2 state at the center
of the trap, and the energy of the M = 0 (or MF = −1)
state at the point where the states MF = 0 and MF = −1
are in resonance. In other words, atoms need a kinetic

oration from the 85Rb F = 2 state. The circles indicate for
which crossing points the couplings are nonzero. The num-
bers indicate the order in which an atom moving out of the

leave the trap is now determined by the diﬀerence between
the trap center and the second crossing. Here B0 = 0.0050 T

energy equal or larger to the energy diﬀerence between
the trap center and the second crossing in Fig. 6.

In this paper we limit our discussion on the F = 2 case
only, but it is obvious that for the 85Rb F = 3 trapping
states we face the same problem as in the F = 2 case for
87Rb and 23Na. In general for the alkali atoms we can
expect that the problem will arise whenever we use the
upper ground state hyperﬁne state as the trapping state
at strong B ﬁelds.

C. Trap conﬁguration

For simplicity we have assumed in our studies the same
spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld as in the experi-
ment by Desruelle et al. [9], except that we have added
a spatially homogeneous compensation ﬁeld. This allows
us to change the general ﬁeld magnitude (depends on the
bias ﬁeld) while keeping the trap shape almost unchanged
(depends also on the bias ﬁeld). Thus we set [9]

where B′ = 9 T/m, B′′/Bbias = 104 m−2, and the trap
center ﬁeld is deﬁned as B0 ≡ Bbias − Bcomp. The actual
trap is cigar-shaped, which is a typical feature in many
experiments. We have selected the x direction as the
basis for our wave packet studies. We set Bbias = 0.0150
T and use Bcomp as a parameter to change B0. Using

C = gJ µBB with Eqs. (2) and (6) we get the spatially
dependent trapping potentials.

III. QUANTUM AND SEMICLASSICAL MODELS

A. Wave packet simulations

For our wave packet studies we ﬁx the rf ﬁeld frequency
to the value νrf = ν0 + 0.25 MHz, where ν0 = [E+2(x =
0) − E+1(x = 0)]/h. With this setting the atoms need
typically a kinetic energy about Ekin/kB ≃ 24 µK in or-
der to reach the crossing between the states MF = 2 and
MF = 1. With our special deﬁnition of νrf the diﬀer-
ences between 23Na and 87Rb appear mainly in the time
scale of atomic motion (Na atoms are lighter and thus
move faster), and in scaling of B. For our selected νrf
we have Bcr = 0.00297 T for 87Rb and Bcr = 0.00152 T
for 23Na. We have used the rf ﬁeld strength Ω = (2π)2.0
kHz), where the rf ﬁeld induced coupling term is [3,8]

in the |F, MF i basis as indicated.

The wave packet simulations were performed in the
same manner as in the previous study [3]. Our initial
wave packet has a Gaussian shape, with a width of 10 µm.
For all practical purposes this wave packet is very narrow
both in position and momentum, and the spreading due
to its natural dispersion is not an important factor. We
identify the mean momentum of the wave packet with the
atomic kinetic energy Ekin, and set Ekin/kB = 30 µK.
In the experiment by Desruelle et al. one had typically
B0 = Bbias = 0.0150 T, which sets the kinetic energy for
reaching the resonance points (for any practical value of
νrf ) too large for realistic numerical simulations. Thus we
have introduced the compensation ﬁeld and limit B0 to
values below 0.0050 T. But the main conclusions from our
study apply to larger values of B0 and Ekin, and many of
the results can be scaled to other parameter regions with
the semiclassical models.

Another simpliﬁcation is that we consider only one
spatial dimension. This is necessary simply because we
have chosen to work with relatively large energies, such as
30 µK. Numerical wave packet calculations at the corre-
sponding velocities require on the order of 100 000 points
for both the spatial and temporal dimensions. As dis-
cussed in Ref. [3], however, this is not a crucial simpliﬁ-
cation.

Basically, we solve the ﬁve-component Schr¨odinger

equation

The components of the state vector Ψ(x, t) stand for the
time dependent probability distributions for each MF
state. The oﬀ-diagonal part of the Hamiltonian H is
given Eq. (7). The diagonal terms are

−

2m

∂2
∂x2 + UMF(x) − MF hνrf ,

(9)

where m is the atomic mass and UMF(x) are the trap
potentials as in Fig. 1(a). For states MF = −2 and
MF = −1 we use absorbing boundaries, and reﬂecting
ones for the others. The numerical solution method is the
split operator method, with the kinetic term evaluated by
the Crank-Nicholson approach [13,14].

B. Semiclassical models

For small magnetic ﬁelds the rf ﬁeld induced reso-
nances between adjacent states occur at the same po-
sition, x = xC . In this situation the spin-change proba-
bility for atoms which traverse the resonance is given by
the multistate extension [8,15] of the two-state Landau-
Zener model [16]. We have earlier shown that for the
evaporation in 23Na F = 2 state at Ekin/kB = 5 µK and
small B this model predicts the wave packet results very
well [3].

The solution for the multistate problem can be ex-
pressed with the solutions to the two-state Landau-Zener
(LZ) model, so we shall begin by discussing the two-
state case ﬁrst. Let us consider two potentials, U1 and
U2, which intersect at x = xC and are coupled by V .
For strong B, when the crossings are well separated in
our alkali F = 2 system, V is equal to ¯hΩ or
3/2¯hΩ,
depending which pair of adjacent states is involved [see
Eq. (7)].

p

In addition to the coupling V , the relevant factors are
the speed vC of the wave packet and the slopes of the
trapping potentials UMF(x) at the crossing. We deﬁne

The speed of the wave packet enters the problem as we
describe the traversing of the crossing with a simple clas-
sical trajectory, x = vC (t − t0) + x0. This allows us
to enter the purely time-dependent description where
the population transfer is given by the two-component
Schr¨odinger equation

This is the original Landau-Zener theory. In this form it
is fully quantum and we can obtain an analytic expression

for state populations P1 and P2 after the crossing. If state
1 was the initial state, then

P1 = 1 − exp(−πΛ)
P2 = exp(−πΛ)

,

Λ =

(12)

Obviously, the Landau-Zener model is only applicable
when the total energy is higher than the bare-state energy
at the resonance point. For more details about applying
LZ theory to wave packet dynamics see Refs. [14,17,18].
And now we return to the original multistate problem.
According to the ﬁve-state case of the multistate model
(see e.g. Ref. [8]) the populations PMF for the untrapped
states after one traversal of the crossing are

P2 = p4,
P1 = 4(1 − p)p3,
P0 = 6(1 − p)2p2,
P−1 = 4(1 − p)3p,
P−2 = (1 − p)4,

(13)

where p = exp(−πΛ), and Λ is deﬁned by setting V =
¯hΩ/2. This assumes that we were intially on state MF =
2. We can see that the ﬁnal population of the initial
state, P2, is equal to exp[−π¯hΩ2/(2αvC )] for both the
two-state and the multistate model if Hamiltonian (7) is
used.

IV. RESULTS

Typical examples of the atomic wave packet evolu-
tion for the three trapping states are shown in Figs. 7
and 8. They demonstrate the sloshing discussed e.g. in
Refs. [3,6,9]. The amplitudes of the components de-
crease as population is partly transferred to another
state. Similarly new wave packet components can ap-
pear at crossings. As a wave packet component reaches
a turning point it sharpens strongly. In Fig. 7 we have
B0 = 0.0018 T, which means that there is no crossing be-
tween states MF = 0 and MF = −1. Population transfer
from the state MF = 1 to MF = 0 is weak. The MF = 0
wave packet component has turning points beyond the
integration space.

As sloshing continues St¨uckelberg oscillations could
take place as split wave packet components merge again
at crossings and interfere (for further discussion, see
Refs. [14,19]). However, the wave packet contains sev-
eral momentum components and thus such oscillations
are not likely observed, because they are very sensitive
to phase diﬀerences. In our simulations we saw no major
indication of inteferences.

In Fig. 9 we track the trap state populations and their
sum as the wave packet sloshes in the trap and traverses
several crossings. The magnetic ﬁeld values are strong
enough to ensure that the crossings are well separated.
We can identify when the various crossings take place al-
though some of them happen simultaneously. The ﬁlled

symbols indicate the corresponding Landau-Zener pre-
dictions, and we ﬁnd that the agreement is excellent.
Some oscillations appear for the 23Na case [Fig. 7(a)]
at times between 3.5 ms and 4.5 ms. These may arise
from St¨uckelberg oscillations, but they do not aﬀect the
ﬁnal transition probabilities, supporting our assumption
that in the end such oscillations average out. Note that
for 23Na there is no resonance between states MF = 0
and MF = −1, but for 87Rb there is and it is seen as
a stepwise reduction of PS ≡ P (MF = 2) + P (MF =
1) + P (MF = 0).

Near the critical ﬁeld Bcr the probability to leave the
trap via states MF = −2 and MF = −1 varies strongly
with B0. When B0 < Bcr the wave packet meets two
crossings between the states MF = −1 and MF = 0 as it
traverses the region around the trap center x = 0 on state
MF = 0. At both crossings some population leaks into
the state MF = −1, as seen in Fig. 10 for B0 = 0.0028 T.
As B0 increases, the two crossing points, on opposite
sides of x = 0, begin to merge, until they disappear at
x = 0 when B = Bcr. Then the transfer between the
two states becomes oﬀ-resonant (or tunnelling), and its
probability decreases exponentially as a function of some
ratio of Ω and the energy diﬀerence between the states
MF = −1 and MF = 0 at x = 0. This situation cor-
responds to the parabolic level crossing model [20]. But
the main point is that the oﬀ-resonant process is unlikely
to play any major role.

Finally, in Fig. 11 we show how the transfer probabil-
ity between the trap states at the ﬁrst crossing changes
as a function of B0. The multistate process transforms
smoothly into a two-state process between the states
MF = 2 and MF = 1. The transition zone is rather large,
though, with B0 ranging from 0 to 0.0010 T. The transfer
process in this zone is the oﬀ-resonant two-photon trans-
fer demonstrated in Fig. 2. An analogous process can
occur in atoms interacting with chirped pulses [21].

An interesting point is that the population of the initial
state is not aﬀected by the fact how the transferred pop-
ulation is distributed to the other involved states. This
seems to be typical for the Landau-Zener crossings [22].
The solid lines indicate the predictions of the two-state
model, and the dotted lines the multistate model. They
change with B0 because the location of the ﬁrst crossing
point and thus the wave packet speed vC at this point
change slightly with B0.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Our results show that in general the semiclassical level
crossing models oﬀer a clear understanding of the single
atomic dynamics during the evaporation process. Also,
we have veriﬁed with wave packet calculations that the
interpretations presented by Desruelle et al. for their
87Rb experiment [9] are correct. The simple picture of
evaporation at near-zero magnetic ﬁelds transforms into a

6

complex sequence of two-state crossings at ﬁeld strengths
above about 0.0010 T. For all alkali systems where F = 2
is the upper hyperﬁne ground state the evaporation will
stop before condensation as the necessary resonances dis-
appear too soon as a function of the rf ﬁeld frequency.
We have shown that tunnelling does not really play a role
once the resonances have been lost. Further complica-
tions arise from the fact that the MF = 0 state becomes
a trapping state.

In experiments, as suggested by Desruelle et al., one
could avoid the problem by coupling the F = 2, MF = 2
trapping state to the F = 1, MF = 1 nontrapping state,
or by using several rf ﬁelds of diﬀerent frequencies within
the F = 2 hyperﬁne manifold. Although for 87Rb one
has observed a long-lasting coexistence of F = 1 and
F = 2 condensates, theoretical studies [23] predict this
diﬃcult for 23Na due to destructive collisions. Thus the
ﬁrst approach may apply better for 87Rb than for 23Na.
We have calculated earlier [3] that for 23Na the colli-
sions between atoms in the MF = 0 and MF = 2 states
are very destructive, with a rate coeﬃcient on the order
of 10−11 cm3/s. For practical bias ﬁeld strengths the MF
state is also a trapping state. Thus the eﬃciency of evap-
oration is reduced, and the time the atoms spend on the
MF = 0 state increase, making it more likely to have a de-
structive, energy releasing collision. So far condensation
on the F = 2 state for Na has not been achieved. Even
in the weak B ﬁeld case evaporation can produce atoms
on MF = 0 state via nonadiabatic transitions. Thus the
role of inelastic collisions is expected to be enhanced for
the ﬁeld strengths considered here.

Once condensation is reached, however, the nonlinear-
ity of the Zeeman shifts can be an asset rather than a
nuisance. For instance, one could create a new type of
binary condensates by making a selective transfer of part
of the condensate from the F = 2, MF = 2 state to the
F = 2, MF = 1 state, either by using resonant or chirped
rf ﬁeld pulses. Alternatively, two rf pulses of diﬀerent
frequencies or perhaps a single chirped pulse might allow
one to transfer the condenstate from the F = 2, MF = 2
state to the F = 2, MF = 0 state and let it expand nor-
mally, without the need to switch the magnetic ﬁelds oﬀ.
Of course, this would work only when B is so small that
the trapping nature of the MF state is not too strong.

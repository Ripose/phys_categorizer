We perform dynamical calculations of direct muon-transfer rates from thermalized muonic hy-
drogen isotopes to bare nuclei C6+ and O8+. For these three-body charge-transfer reactions with
Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal state we use two-component integro-diﬀerential Faddeev-Hahn-type
equations in conﬁguration space using close-coupling approximation. To take into account the high
polarizability of the muonic hydrogen due to the large charge of the incident nuclei, a polarization
potential is included in the elastic channel. The large ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction is explicitly
included in the transfer channel. The transfer rates so calculated are in good agreement with recent
experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Mainly motivated by the possibility of muon-catalyzed fusion of the hydrogen isotopes, theoretical and experimental
investigations of exotic atomic and molecular systems involving negative muon (µ−) and reactions in such systems
continue to be active ﬁelds of current research [1]. Particular attention is devoted to the study of the muon-transfer
reaction from muonic hydrogen to other elements XZ+ with large positive charge Z, because such reactions may have
large cross sections and rates. If the hydrogen is contaminated by even a small amount of these heavier elements,
this may strongly inﬂuence the process of muon-catalyzed fusion by hydrogen isotopes. Consequently, there has
been considerable recent experimental interest in the study of the muon-transfer reaction in the collision of the
muonic hydrogen by heavier nuclei, e.g. carbon (C6+), oxygen (O8+), neon (Ne10+), argon (Ar18+) [2–6] etc. On
the theoretical side, these three-body charge transfer reactions involving a heavy transferred particle like muon and a
strong Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal state involving nuclei, such as carbon and oxygen, continue to be challanging
problems calling for new investigations.

Experimental study of muon-transfer rates from muonic hydrogen Hµ to heavier nuclei, such as Ar18+, Kr36+ and
Xe54+, have revealed a smooth Z dependence [7].
In these cases the transfer rate λZ increases linearly with Z.
Theoretical analyses are also in agreement with this conclusion [8]. However, it has been found in recent experiment
that the predicted monotonic Z dependence of the muon-transfer rate is not valid for all Z [5,9]. For these transfer
rates, pronounced ﬂuctuations have been observed for elements up to argon contrary to the smooth Z dependence.
The experimental muon transfer rates for reactions like

(Hµ)1s + XZ+

(Xµ)(Z−1)+ + H+

→

(1.1)

depend in a complicated manner on the charge Z [9]. Here H stands for the hydrogen isotope p (proton) or d (deuteron)
and XZ+ stands for the target nuclei.

Another phenomenon which has not yet found a satisfactory theoretical explanation is the measured isotope eﬀect,
e.g. the trend of the direct muon-transfer rate of reaction (1.1) from pµ and dµ to XZ+, where XZ+ represents C6+,
O8+ [3], Ne10+ [9], Ar18+ [2], and Xe54+ [10]. In cases of O8+, Ar18+ and Xe54+ the direct-transfer rate decreases
with increasing mass of the hydrogen isotope. Theoretical analyses [8,11] also support this trend. The experimental
results for Ne10 [5,9] and sulphur dioxide [3] diﬀer considerably from the theoretical predictions.

In view of this, here we perform quantum dynamical calculation of muon-transfer rates from pµ to C6+ and O8+
and from dµ to O8+. For this purpose, we use close-coupling approximation to two-component Faddeev-Hahn-type
dynamical equations [12,13]. We are currently investigating muon-transfer rates from muonic hydrogen to other
heavier elements for a future publication.

It is diﬃcult to perform a quantum dynamical calculation of a charge-transfer reaction. In addition, a theoretical
study of the problems above is extremely complicated due to the large charge of these heavy nuclei and the presence
of a large number of open channels even at zero incident energy. The large charge of the nuclei leads to a strong
polarization of the muonic hydrogen in the initial state and a strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion. It is diﬃcult to
incorporate these two eﬀects properly in a dynamical calculation. This is why there are no dynamical calculations of
these muon-transfer rates.

Although there is a very large number of open channels in this problem, for a given nuclei the muon is transferred
predominantly to a few (muonic) atomic labels of the heavy nuclei [8,11]. For example, muon is captured mostly in the
n = 4 states of C6+, and n = 5 states of O8+. Also these transfers take place mostly to the ﬁnal muonic-atomic states
with low angular momenta and transfer rates are negligible for atomic states with angular momenta l > 2. The correct
dynamical formulation should include all the important transfer channels and we included them in a previous study
on muon transfer with light nuclear targets [14–17]. However, it is quite impossible now to treat even this reduced
number of open transfer channels in a dynamical calculation with heavier targets due to convergence diﬃculties in
the presence of the large polarization potential and large ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction mentioned above. Hence in
the present treatment we use a two-channel model to calculate transfer to a single ﬁnal state, where we include the
elastic and one transfer channels. Diﬀerent sets of equations are used for the diﬀerent ﬁnal states. Eventually, the
total transfer rate is calculated by summing the diﬀerent contributions.

The two-component Faddeev-Hahn-type equation, we use, allows us to introduce explicitly a polarization potential
in the initial channel and the repulsive Coulomb potential in the ﬁnal channel. This has the advantage of building
in the correct asymptotic behavior of the wave function in a low-order close-coupling type approximation [18]. Hence
as in Ref. [14–16] we make a two-state close-coupling approximation to the Faddeev-Hahn-type equation in the
present study and ﬁnd that a numerical solution using the present scheme leads to very encouraging agreement with
experimental transfer rates.

In Sec. II we present our formalism. Numerical results for muon-transfer rates from muonic hydrogen to carbon
and oxygen are given in Sec. III and compared with those of other investigations. In Sec. IV we present a summary
and outlook.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

The theoretical framework for the present study will be based on the formalism developed in Ref. [15] which was
used for the study of muon transfer from muonic hydrogen atoms to light charged nuclei, such as, He2+ and Li3+.
Here we shall perform a similar study with heavier charged nuclei, such as, C6+ and O8+. The presence of the strong
Coulomb interaction and the associated large polarization interaction make the present calculational scheme far more
complicated theoretically and numerically compared to that of Ref. [15]. The formalism of Ref. [15] is a generalization
over that of Ref. [14] for charge-transfer reaction with no ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction. In the dynamical equations
in Ref. [15] the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction is explicitly included in the transfer channel. In addition, in the present
work we explicitly include a polarization potential in the elastic channel. In a coupled-channel approach for atomic
processes, the coupling to inﬁnite number of p-wave states is responsible for generating the polarization potential
[19]. As it is impossible to include all such states in a numerical scheme, the commonly accepted procedure is to
replace these coupling terms by a polarization potential as in Ref. [20]. This idea has been recently used successfully
in antiproton-hydrogen and antihydrogen-hydrogen reactions [21]. Next we describe the dynamical equations we use
based on the close-coupling approximation to Faddeev-Hahn-type two-component equations [14].

We use units e = ¯h = mµ = 1, where mµ (e) is the muonic mass (charge), and denote, the heavy nuclei (C6+ or
O8+) by 1, the hydrogen isotopes by 2 and muon by 3. Below the three-body breakup threshold, following two-cluster

asymptotic conﬁgurations are possible in the system 123: (23)

where Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) is quadratically integrable over the variable ~r23, and Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) over the variable ~r13. The compo-
nents Ψ1 and Ψ2 carry the asymptotic boundary condition for channels 1 and 2, respectively. The second component
is responsible for pure Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal state. These components satisfy the following set of two

and zero otherwise. The value of the cut-oﬀ parameter Λ has to be chosen appropriately (see Sec. III). By adding
Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) we ﬁnd that they are equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation.

Distortion potential has been very useful in model and phenomenological description of reaction and scattering in
nuclear [22] and atomic physics [23]. Although such distortion potentials are unnecessary in a complete solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation, they enhance the agreement with experiment in a simpliﬁed model description. For example,
a long-range polarization (distortion) potential has been routinely used in electron-atom scattering [20,24]. Such a
distortion potential arising from the polarization of the muonic hydrogen isotope due to the bare nuclei is eﬀective in
the initial channel and has been included in Eq. (2.2). This polarization potential for C6+ or O8+ is much stronger
and its eﬀect on cross sections much more pronounced than in the case of electron scattering. Hence, for obtaining
a better agreement with experiment in a model calculation it is prudent to include the polarization potential in the
elastic channel. There should also be such a polarization potential in the ﬁnal channel. However, by far the most
important interaction in the ﬁnal channel is the Coulomb potential between the proton (or deuteron) and the charged
muonic atom (Xµ)(Z−1)+. This Coulomb (distortion) potential has also been explicitly included in Eq. (2.3). This
will help in obtaining a realistic description of the transfer process as we shall ﬁnd in the following.

Because of the strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction in the present muon-transfer problems it is very diﬃcult to
develop and solve successfully multichannel models based on Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) above as in Ref. [15]. Hence, for
solving Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) we expand the wave function components in terms of bound states in initial and ﬁnal
channels, and project these equations on these bound states. The expansion of the wave function is given by

We ﬁnd that after the projection of the Faddeev-Hahn-type equations (2.2) and (2.3) on the basis states, the initial-
state polarization and the ﬁnal-state Coulomb potentials survive on the left-hand-side of the resultant equations (2.8)
and (2.9). The presence of the explicit Coulomb potential in the ﬁnal channel will automatically yield the correct
physical Coulomb-wave boundary condition in that channel. The explicit inclusion of the polarization potential,
although has no eﬀect on the boundary condition in the initial channel, substantially improves the the results of the
truncated model calculation based on Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) as we shall see in the next section.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We employ muonic atomic unit: distances are measured in units of aµ, where aµ is the radius of muonic hydrogen
atom. The integro-diﬀerential equations are solved by discretizing them into a linear system of equations. The
integrals in Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) are discretized using the trapezoidal rule and the partial derivatives are discretized
using a three-point rule [25]. The discretized equation is subsequently solved by Gauss elimination method. As we
are concerned with the low-energy limit, only the total angular momentum L = 0 is taken into account. Even at zero
incident energy, the transfer channels are open and their wave functions are rapidly oscillating Coulomb waves. In
order to get a converged solution we needed a large number of discretization points. More points are taken near the
origin where the interaction potentials are large; a smaller number of points are needed at large distances.

First we solved the system of equations without the polarization potential in the incident channel. However, the
ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction is correctly represented in our model. In this case it is relatively easy to obtain the
numerical convergence for the system of equations which includes the elastic channel and one transfer channel at a
time. Finally, the total transfer cross section is calculated by adding the results of diﬀerent two-channel contributions.
Without the polarization potential, we needed up to 700 discretization points adequately distributed between 0 and
50aµ. Near the origin we took up to 60 equally spaced points per unit interval (aµ).

It was more diﬃcult to obtain convergence with the polarization potential. The polarization potential (2.5) is taken
to be zero at small distances below the cut oﬀ Λ. In this case to get numerical convergence we had to integrate to very

4

−

large distances
up to 300aµ. We needed up to 2000 discretization points to obtain convergence. Again we needed
more points near the origin and less at large distances. For example, near the origin we took up to 60 equally spaced
20aµ) we took up to 15 equally spaced points
points per unit length interval aµ; in the intermediate region (ρ = 10
per unit length interval, and in the asymptotic region (ρ = 20
300aµ) we took up to 5 equally spaced points per unit
length interval. It is well-known that the results for the cross section is sensitive to the value of the cut oﬀ Λ of the
polarization potential. The short-range potential of the present problem extends to about 25aµ. We considered the
polarization potential in the asymptotic region ρ1 > Λ
75aµ. For a small variation of Λ in this region from 75aµ to
about 120aµ, we ﬁnd the transfer cross sections to be reasonably constant and the reported transfer cross sections of
this study are the averages of these cross sections. If Λ is increased past 120aµ, the eﬀect of the polarization potential
on the cross sections gradually decreases and ﬁnally disappears. If Λ is decreased much below 75aµ, the cross sections
become rapidly varying function of Λ and could become unphysically large. The range of Λ values (here between 75aµ
and 120aµ) for which the cross sections are slowly varying smooth functions should increase with the charge of the
bare nucleus.

section. In this work using the model of Sec. II we calculate the low-energy muon-transfer rates from (pµ)1s to C6+

C6+ the transfer takes place predominantly to the n = 4 state and for O8+ it happens to the n = 5 state, which is
also found to be true in our model calculation. Hence in this work we only present rates for the l = 0, 1, 2 states of
the n = 4 and 5 orbitals of carbon and oxygen, respectively. The contribution of the higher angular momentum states
to the total transfer cross section is very small. Numerically converged results were obtained in these cases. The low

the polarization potential increases with decreasing center-of-mass energy E and saturates to a constant value for
E < 0.04 eV for 4s, 4p, and 4d states of muonic carbon. In the case of C6+ the transfer takes place predominantly to
the 4s state. These qualitative behaviors are also true after the inclusion of the polarization potential and were also
true in a previous theoretical study. However, after the inclusion of the polarization potential the 4s and 4p transfer

The transfer rate is higher in the 5s state and lowest in the 5d state. This behavior remain true after the inclusion of

We have studied muon-transfer reactions from muonic hydrogen to carbon and oxygen nuclei employing a full
quantum-mechanical few-body description of rearrangement scattering by solving the Faddeev-Hahn-type equations
using close-coupling approximation. To provide the correct asymptotic form of the wave function in the transfer
channel, the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction has been incorporated directly into the equations. We also included a
polarization potential at large distances in the initial channel. It is shown that in the present approach, the application
of a close-coupling-type ansatz leads to satisfactory results for direct muon-transfer reactions from muonic hydrogen
to C6+ and O8+. In the case of muon transfer from (pµ)1s to C6+ the present transfer rate to the 4s state of muonic
carbon is about 1.5 times larger than that to the 4p state. For muon transfer from (pµ)1s to O8+, the present

transfer rate to the 5s state of oxygen is about twice as large as that to the 5p state. The present rates are much
larger by factors of about two to three compared to the calculation of Ref. [11]. Finally, in the case of muon transfer
from (dµ)1s to O8+, the present transfer rate to the 5s state is large compared to that to the 5p state. In all cases
the inclusion of the polarization potential improves the agreement with experiment and our ﬁnal transfer rates are
in encouraging agreement with recent experiments [2–4]. The present rates for oxygen from (pµ)1s and (dµ)1s are
in agreement with the observed isotope eﬀect [3]: the transfer rate increases with the decrease of the mass of the
hydrogen isotope. Because of the present promising results for the muon-transfer rates for Z = 6 and Z = 8 it seems
useful to make future applications of the present formulation for larger targets. Calculations involving nuclei of higher
charges (Ne10+, S16+, Ar18+ etc.) are in progress.

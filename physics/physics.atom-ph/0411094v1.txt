1. Introduction

The enormous progress in laser spectroscopy, laser cooling and trapping of ions and neutral atoms, combined
with novel eﬃcient methods for precision optical frequency metrology has had a strong impact on the development
of high-performance optical frequency standards and optical clocks. Such standards are widely used and serve as
the most accurate realizations of the length unit [1], for tests of fundamental theories and for the determination
of fundamental constants with increasing accuracy [2,3]. In contrast to today’s atomic clocks operating in the
microwave region, the optical frequencies, higher by roughly ﬁve orders of magnitude, can lead to a corresponding
increase in frequency stability. Moreover, higher clock frequencies should lead to reduced fractional systematic
shifts in the measured frequency, thus increasing clock accuracy.

However, to realize the full potential of a high-performance optical frequency standard, two critical issues need
to be resolved. First, residual line broadening and shifts caused by the thermal motion of the atoms need to be
reduced or eliminated. Second, technical noise sources in the interrogation oscillators and the detection have to
be suppressed. Laser-cooling techniques to achieve microkelvin temperatures have been demonstrated both for
neutral atoms [4,5,6] in magneto-optical traps (MOTs) and single ions [7,8] trapped in the center of radio-frequency
(Paul) traps [9]. The former systems probe a large number of atoms (∼ 107) released from MOTs in ﬁeld-free
environments, therefore achieving exceptional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but suﬀering from a residual Doppler
eﬀect [10,11]. The single-ion approach provides a Doppler-free environment but suﬀers from the limitation in SNR.
To combine the advantages of both approaches a new concept has been proposed to trap ensembles of neutral
atoms in an array of optical dipole traps. Initial experiments based on this approach are now under way in several
laboratories (e. g. [12]).

Neutral atoms as well as single ions have been successfully applied in time and length metrology. Absolute
frequency measurements with relative frequency uncertainties on the level of 10−14 have been performed for
neutral Ca [3,13] and H atoms [14] and for Hg+, In+, Sr+, and Yb+ ions [3,15,16,17].

A recent advance for absolute frequency measurements in the optical domain utilizes optical frequency comb
generators based on mode-locked femtosecond lasers [18,19]. Such a system allows one to eﬀectively eliminate
the uncertainty contribution of the measurement process. The capability of such systems to compare optical
−19 [20] has been shown recently. Hence
frequencies with a fractional frequency reproducibility in the range of 10
the application of optical transitions for atomic clocks [21] becomes feasible on a level that today is only reached
by the best atomic clocks operating in the microwave range.

In this article, we present the results from two diﬀerent realizations of an optical frequency standard based on
ensembles of laser-cooled neutral Ca atoms released from magneto-optical traps at PTB, Braunschweig, Germany
and NIST, Boulder, Colorado, USA. The limitation in the achievable accuracy due to the residual Doppler eﬀect
−15 level in frequency measurements performed at PTB with a new cooling technique
has been overcome on a 10
−16 by use of a new method developed at NIST based on
[6]. They might be minimized further to well below 10
an idea by Trebst et al. [10]. Frequency measurements performed in both places lead to the Ca clock transition
frequency being known with one of the lowest uncertainties in the optical range and agree well within the respective
uncertainty budgets of the two setups. We will summarize the results achieved for millikelvin as well as microkelvin
atomic ensembles utilized in the frequency standards and present the prominent properties of this Ca clock
transition that make it particularly suitable for the realization of a future optical clock.

2. Experiment

Both experiments use a continuously repeated measurement sequence consisting of two trapping and cooling
stages, manipulation of the cooled atoms for investigating systematics, spectroscopy and detection. In the ﬁrst
cooling stage atoms are captured from a thermal atomic beam and cooled to millikelvin temperatures by use
of a standard MOT based on the broad 423 nm transition (Fig. 1) that is almost closed. At PTB, 500 mW of
423 nm light from a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire laser is used. A small loss channel with a small fraction of
excited atoms on the cooling transition decaying to intermediate long lived states [22] is closed by use of a repump
laser at 672 nm (see Fig. 1). At NIST, 40 mW of frequency-doubled light from a diode laser system is applied,

no repump laser is used and a slowing beam is applied to increase the number of atoms in the thermal beam
with velocities below 30 m/s that can be trapped by the 423 nm MOT. In a second cooling stage the atoms
are further Doppler cooled in a MOT utilizing the narrow 657 nm clock transition to about 10 µK. Here the
excited state is optically quenched to increase the cooling and trapping forces well above the gravitational force.
The two systems use diﬀerent quenching transitions to increase the photon scattering rates (see Fig. 1). From
the initial numbers of 8 · 107 and 5 · 106 atoms at 3 mK loaded in 350 ms at PTB and 25 ms at NIST up to
40 % are transferred to the microkelvin ensemble. The times for the second-stage cooling are 20 ms and 7 ms and
temperatures of around 12 µK are reached [6,23]. After the external ﬁelds are switched oﬀ releasing the atoms
from the trap and switching on a homogenous magnetic quantization ﬁeld, a spectroscopic sequence is applied
that excites some fraction of the atoms with laser pulses resonant with the clock transition. Directly after this
spectroscopic sequence, the normalized excitation probability of the atomic ensembles is measured. The detection
scheme used for this purpose takes advantage of the high number of photons that can be scattered on the 423 nm
transition [23,24,25] and gives a signal that is independent of ﬂuctuations of atom number due to the normalization
technique. Thus, the detection does not present a limitation to the principally achievable SNR given by quantum
projection noise (QPN) [26] (see section 2.2).

2.1. Interrogating the clock transition

Prior to the interrogation of the clock transition all external ﬁelds are switched oﬀ to minimize systematic shifts
due to electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and a homogeneous bias magnetic ﬁeld of 0.1 – 0.2 mT is applied. To allow
for the eddy currents to decay and the magnetic ﬁelds to settle, waiting times of 200 µs with magnetic ﬁeld coils
located in the vacuum are used at PTB, and waiting times of 1 ms are used at NIST with the coils located outside
the vacuum chamber. To probe the clock transition at a resolution close to its natural linewidth, the use of both
highly coherent laser radiation and atom interferometry in the time domain is necessary.

2.1.1. Clock lasers

The highly coherent radiation to interrogate the atoms is generated from diode laser systems whose frequencies
are stabilized to non tunable reference Fabry-Perot resonators by means of the Pound-Drever-Hall technique
[27]. The temperature-stabilized, vibrationally- and acoustically-isolated cavities [28], with ﬁnesses around 105,
provide low noise, high-Q reference resonators for the diode laser systems [24]. The laser systems are based
on anti-reﬂection-coated commercial laser diodes in an extended cavity design and provide cost-eﬀective highly
coherent sources. With the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique linewidths as low as 1 Hz (see Fig. 3) can
be produced. The laser frequencies are widely tunable due to the application of acousto-optic modulators (AOMs)
to provide frequency oﬀsets between laser sources and reference resonators. Both laboratories utilize such lasers
as highly stable master lasers. Several slave lasers are injection-locked to the master lasers in order to obtain
the higher power (tens of milliwatts) required for the interrogation of the clock transition and the second-stage
cooling.

2.1.2. Atom interferometry in the time domain

A Doppler-free method that can be described as optical Ramsey excitation [29] or as an atom interferometer
[30] is used to overcome the limitations due to the residual Doppler broadening of about 2 MHz and 150 kHz for

the millikelvin and microkelvin regimes, respectively. In the time domain a sequence of two pairs of laser pulses
from opposite directions are applied to the atomic ensemble. Each pulse provides an excitation probability of 50 %
for atoms on resonance (Rabi-angle of π/2), thereby preparing each atom in a superposition of ground and excited
states, and redirecting the atomic matter waves due to the photon recoil on two closed interferometer paths of the
Mach-Zehnder type. For each atom passing through either of the closed interferometers the excitation probability
at the exit depends on the accumulated phase diﬀerences between the partial waves gathered along the paths:

Φ1234 = 4πT (νL − νCa ± δrec) − φA(t1, r1) + φA(t2, r2) − φB(t3, r3) + φB(t4, r4).

(1)

The phase diﬀerence depends on the detuning of the laser frequency νL from the clock transition νCa including
the recoil shift δrec = ¯hk2/4πm, with m the mass of the Ca atom, and a phase contribution seen by the atom
due to the instantaneous laser phases φd at the time tl, and the atomic position r(tl) of each pulse from direction
d = (A, B). The interference pattern, i. e., the fractional excitation as function of the laser detuning, has a cosine
shape and is basically symmetric with its center at the clock transition (Fig. 4) when the contribution of the
instantaneous laser phases is zero. Thus, for the realization of the frequency standard, the laser can be locked to
the central fringe. The slight asymmetry of the envelope of the excitation spectrum shown in Fig. 4 is induced by
atomic recoil in the absorption and stimulated emission processes and is an inherent eﬀect. The position of the
central fringe with respect to the frequency of the undisturbed clock transition is shifted by less than 100 mHz.

In order to achieve almost equal excitation probabilities for all atoms in the Doppler distribution, the widths
Tp of the squares pulses are set to 1 to 2 µs to achieve Fourier transform widths of up to 1 MHz. By setting the
interval T between the parallel pulses to several hundred microseconds the interferometer resolutions can be well
below 1 kHz.

A critical aspect of this work hinges on the observation that a non-zero oﬀset phase shifts the fringe pattern

with respect to νCa and leads to a systematic shift in the measured transition frequency given by

∆ν = −(−φA(t1, r1) + φA(t2, r2) − φB(t3, r3) + φB(t4, r4))/(4πT ).

(2)

Quantifying the contributions to this shift is an essential part of determining the uncertainty of the frequency
standard. At present, a direct laser light phase shift and an indirect shift due to the Doppler eﬀect are the biggest
contributors to the uncertainty budget (see section 3).

2.2. Fractional frequency stability

A key ingredient to a frequency standard is good stability. The associated short averaging times required to
reach a given frequency uncertainty greatly accelerate measurements and help to identify systematic shifts more
eﬃciently. Due to the large number of absorbers N0, optical frequency standards with neutral atoms have the
potential to provide a much better SNR and consequently a lower instability as compared to standards based on
single trapped ions. The quantum-projection noise involved in the readout of the spectroscopic signal [26] sets the
limit for the minimum fractional frequency instability achievable to 1/(π ·Q·SNR), with the quality-factor Q being

4

the ratio of the transition frequency (ν) to the linewidth (∼ 1/(4T )), and SNR ∝ pN0τ /Tcycl, where τ denotes
the averaging time and Tcycl the cycle time. Using the normalized detection scheme, the detection process does not
limit the performance of the standard. This quantum projection noise limit has already been demonstrated with a
neutral atom microwave clock [31]. To reach this limit in an optical clock, however, extremely narrow-band laser
sources are required. Otherwise, the Dick eﬀect [32] will drastically limit the achievable stability. This is caused
by aliasing of high-frequency laser frequency ﬂuctuations introduced by sampling of the instantaneous laser oﬀset
from the line center in discontinuous interrogation schemes. For typical parameters of the PTB setup with the
laser frequency noise dominated by low-frequency acoustic and seismic noise leading to a laser linewidth of 1 Hz
(see Fig.3) and the poor duty cycle between cooling and interrogation, the degradation of the stability due to the
−1/2 . At present a stability
optical Dick eﬀect [33] results in a relative Allan deviation [34] σy(τ ) = 2 · 10
−15 has been observed. With a cycle time reduced to 15 ms (but using a smaller number
of σy(100 s) = 3 · 10
of atoms) at NIST a fractional Allan-deviation of σy(10 s) = 3 · 10−15 has been observed, that averages down
−16 (see Fig. 5). These measurements were referenced to laser light
for integration times of 800 seconds to 3 · 10
from the Hg+ single-ion frequency standard [35] by use of a femtosecond-laser comb [20]. In both Ca systems the
deviations from the QPN-limits are consistent with the contribution of the optical Dick eﬀect. Even taking the low
atom number at NIST and the Dick eﬀect contribution into account, measurements of systematics (comparison
of two data sets) with a relative uncertainty of 2 · 10

−15 can be achieved within 200 s.

3. Uncertainty of the calcium optical frequency standard

In this section we present the results of frequency measurements and investigations of systematics obtained in
both laboratories utilizing ensembles of millikelvin and microkelvin atoms. We discuss the various sources of the
systematic shifts and their corresponding contributions to the current overall uncertainty budget. Since one of
the primary goals of this research is to identify potential limitations for neutral atom frequency standards, we
conclude the section with both present and projected uncertainty budgets for the Ca optical standard.

3.1. Residual ﬁrst-order Doppler shifts

One signiﬁcant contribution to the uncertainty of the Ca frequency standard is connected with residual atomic
motion, and it is usually referred to as residual ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect. This is to distinguish it from the
relativistic second-order Doppler eﬀect due to the diﬀerent inertial systems of the laboratory and the moving
atoms. The second-order Doppler eﬀect is negligible for laser-cooled ensembles in the millikelvin and microkelvin
regime as opposed to thermal beams. It shifts the frequencies of millikelvin and microkelvin ensembles by less
than 5 mHz and 20 µHz, respectively.

The residual ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect is due to the ballistic movement of the atoms released from the MOT
through the spatial wave fronts of the laser beams. During the time of the atom interferometry (on the order of
1 ms) each atom “sees” a diﬀerent spatial laser phase in each interaction with one of the four laser pulses that
contribute to the overall phase shift in eq. 1. Approximating the wave fronts of the two beams at the position
of the atomic cloud by spherical waves with wave vectors kd and radii of curvature Rd, one ﬁnds a quadratic
dependence of the phase shift on the rms-width of the velocity distribution of the ensemble in a plane tangential
to the curvature. A small tilt β of the wave vector kd with respect to the gravitational equipotential plane leads
to a shift proportional to the angle and independent of the initial velocity of the atoms. Both shifts increase with
the pulse separation T as T 2.

As has been pointed out by Trebst et al. [10], one can actually use the atoms themselves to quantify and reduce
these shifts. By employing diﬀerent types of atom interferometers, one can evaluate the laser-beam parameters
at the location of the atomic cloud. A particularly useful interferometer uses three parallel laser pulses separated
by a time T from a single direction. The excitation probability in this symmetric three-pulse atom interferometer
[36,37] does not depend on the laser frequency but on the instantaneous laser phases as Φ123 = −φA(t1, r1) +
2φA(t2, r2) − φA(t3, r3) (compare eq. 1). It has the same dependence on tilt and radius of curvature as the four-
pulse atom interferometer. Thus it can be used to measure the contributions for either of the two beam directions
d = A or d = B (eq. 1). In frequency measurements performed at PTB in 2001 using 3 mK atomic ensembles, these
atom interferometers were used to determine the contribution of the Doppler eﬀect to the systematic frequency
−14 was applied [11]. A contribution that cannot be
shifts, and a correction with a relative uncertainty below 10

quantiﬁed with the three-pulse atom interferometers is due to the mutual angle θ between the counterpropagating
beams, resulting in a non-zero sum-vector of the two wave vectors. An average velocity of the ensemble along
this sum-vector leads to a phase shift proportional to the tilt angle. Nevertheless, by carefully overlapping the
counterpropagating beams the uncertainty contribution with the millikelvin ensemble was reduced to well below
10

−14 [11].
In subsequent frequency measurements in 2003 at PTB utilizing atoms at a temperature of 12 µK, the inﬂuence
of the velocity-dependent wave-front curvature was drastically reduced. Fig. 6 shows this for the example of a
particularly high wave-front curvature. Even with the very large radius of 12 m the contribution to the overall
−15 for the microkelvin ensemble. Consequently one is left with only the contribution
Doppler eﬀect is less than 10
from the angle to gravity β. In measurements at PTB, the symmetric three-pulse atom interferometer was used
to align β to within 100 µrad. This helped to reduce the total uncertainty level due to the residual Doppler eﬀect
to 2 · 10

−15.

At NIST, this approach has been taken a step further by launching the clouds of atoms in order to enhance the
sensitivity of the atom interferometers. Additionally, launching allows one to evaluate the various beam parameters
independently, which enables the following straightforward optimization procedure. One ﬁrst reduces the curvature
of the wavefronts by using the three-pulse interferometer with atomic clouds launched up to 3 m/s. Due to the
quadratic sensitivity of the phase on velocity, one can readily measure radii of curvature Rd of thousands of
meters (see Fig. 7) with NIST’s present signal-to-noise ratio. With the eﬀects due to curved wavefronts thus
reduced, subsequent measurements using the four-pulse interferometer can then enable reduction of the overlap
angle θ to less than 1 µrad (Fig. 8), corresponding to a frequency shift of 0.7 Hz at a launch velocity of 1 m/s.
Finally, the contribution of the tilt angle can be largely suppressed with a beam-reversal technique due to the
minimized radius of curvature and overlap angle contributions. In principle this sequence allows one to reduce the
Doppler-shift contribution to the fractional frequency uncertainty to below 10−17, thereby virtually removing one
of the most challenging systematic eﬀects for the standard. However, detailed measurements have revealed that
−15. While the sensitivity of the method
the present laser-beam quality prevents performance below a level of 10
and the prospects for laser beams of higher quality are certainly good, the issue of beam quality clearly remains
one of the most critical for the future performance of the standard.

3.2. Laser light phase shifts

In addition to the inﬂuence of the Doppler eﬀect on the resulting phase shifts, a direct shift of the global phase
of the laser beams has to be taken into account. As the groups at NIST and PTB have investigated, such a phase
shift can occur from a phase chirp produced in the switching AOMs [3,38,39]. A ringing on the edges of the RF
pulses (and of the acoustic wave in the AOM) is imprinted on the laser pulses. This leads to a constant total
oﬀset phase and, hence, to a frequency shift proportional to the resolution in the four-pulse atom interferometer,
−1. By measuring the frequency shift as a function of resolution and extrapolating to zero
i. e., proportional to T
fringe linewidth, one can correct for this eﬀect. Consistent results using this correction have been achieved at NIST

6

−15. Clearly, reduction of these uncertainties emerges as one of the
and PTB at respective levels of 10
most important issues for future frequency measurements. The determination and correction of these eﬀects, on
the other hand, will be limited ultimately by the remaining uncertainty of the residual ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect,
since both eﬀects depend on the pulse separation T .

−14 and 3 · 10

3.3. Frequency shifts due to external ﬁelds

External ﬁelds interacting with the atoms can shift the frequency of the atoms during interrogation with respect
to unperturbed atoms. On the one hand, constant or slowly ﬂuctuating magnetic and electric dc ﬁelds shift the
frequency due to magnetic eﬀects and the quadratic Stark eﬀect. On the other hand, thermal radiation from the
environment and the oven as well as monochromatic radiation from the lasers can shift the frequency due to the
ac-Stark eﬀect.

3.3.1. Magnetic ﬁeld shifts

The 1S0 (m = 0) to 3P1 (m = 0) clock transition does not have a linear Zeeman shift and has only a small
second-order Zeeman shift. The value of the second-order Zeeman shift of the 3P1 state is known from theoretical
calculations [40] to be (+63.75 ± 0.09) Hz/mT2. The diamagnetic shift of the 1S0 state is likely to be below 1 %
of this value. Measurements on atomic beams and laser-cooled atoms [41,42,43] show the second-order Zeeman
shift of the clock transition to be (+64 ± 1) Hz/mT2. Typically a quantization ﬁeld of 0.1 to 0.2 mT separates
the Zeeman components (∆m = ±1) well from the ∆m = 0 component. This ﬁeld can be measured by use of the
Zeeman components that are separated from the ∆m = 0 component with ±21.01 MHz/mT [41]. When measuring
the ﬁeld with a relative uncertainty of 0.5 % and using the theoretical coeﬃcient with an uncertainty of 1 %, the
quadratic Zeeman shift at 0.2 mT can be corrected with an uncertainty of 36 mHz.

3.3.2. DC electric ﬁelds

The coeﬃcient for the quadratic Stark eﬀect is well known from measurements by Zeiske [44] of the diﬀerences
∆α of the static polarizabilities of the clock states. For electric stray ﬁelds stemming from arbitrary electric
charges on the surfaces of the vacuum chambers and magnetic ﬁeld coils (distance to trap ≥ 3 cm) an average
value ∆α = (3.07 ± 0.06) µHz/(V/m)2 can be used to correct for shifts. If we assume that electric potentials are
less than 10 V on the grounded surfaces (E ≤ 200 V/m), the resulting shift lies between 0 mHz and -70 mHz.
If we assume equal probability of a shift within this interval, the average shift is (−35 ± 20) mHz. Higher-order
contributions shift the transition by not more than a few microhertz for dc ﬁeld levels up to 1 kV/m.

3.3.3. Blackbody radiation

−10 Hz

The inﬂuence of the radiation due to the ambient temperature in the lab (between 288 K and 298 K) can be
estimated based on a quasi-static approach [44]. With the atoms placed in a blackbody-radiation environment
K4 · ϑ4. The inﬂuence of the radiation of the Ca
of temperature ϑ the systematic shift is (−1.31 ± 0.03) · 10
oven at 900 K can be obtained from an exact calculation based on an approach by Farley and Wing [45], which
includes all relevant transitions. The calculated shift is about 45 % larger than the one found with the quasi-static
approach. However, it is diﬃcult to estimate the level of radiation from the oven reaching the atomic cloud.
Therefore measurements of the shifts at various oven temperatures were performed at PTB during the frequency
measurements in 2001 and 2003, resulting in an estimate of the shift of (−2.8 ± 3.9) Hz. This is at present the
largest contribution to the total uncertainty. Proper shielding of the trap from the oven, possible with the use of a
Zeeman slower and an optically deﬂected atomic beam, will allow one to eliminate the oven contribution. This will
reduce the uncertainty in the correction of the blackbody shift to the contribution of the room-temperature. For
a temperature of ϑ = 293 K known to ±1 K the uncertainty in the correction could then be reduced to 24 mHz.

3.3.4. AC Stark eﬀect

In the PTB setup the inﬂuence of residual laser light from the cooling and quenching lasers is eliminated by the
use of mechanical shutters. At NIST the light is switched oﬀ using multiple deﬂections in AOMs. Measurements
with increased residual light levels, when AOMs were left on, showed that even when the frequency oﬀsets with
the AOMs switched oﬀ are neglected, the shifts are less than 1 mHz for the blue cooling laser and 85 mHz for
the quench laser. Presently, the red light in the cooling and probing beams is less well isolated and can lead to

frequency shifts of up to 0.5 Hz. Cascading multiple AOMs in a suitable way will allow one to reduce this shift
−17, the use of mechanical shutters
to the millihertz level as well. Hence, even at a relative uncertainty level of 10
can be avoided, thereby avoiding compromises regarding cycle times and stability.

3.4. Collisions with thermal atoms

In the PTB setup the cold ensemble is shielded from collisions with thermal atoms by a beam block placed in the
path of the thermal beam. Without the aperture, trap losses due to collisions with thermal atoms would strongly
reduce the number of atoms in the trap. In the similar NIST setup no aperture is used, but the oven is run at a
lower temperature. The inﬂuence of collisions with thermal atoms on the frequency shift was measured referencing
the Ca frequency to NIST’s optical Hg+ frequency standard and to NIST’s H masers using the femtosecond-laser
comb. Fig. 9 shows a measurement against Hg+ when the ﬂux of atoms was changed by a factor of 2. No frequency
change was observed that would be signiﬁcant on a 1 Hz level. In the future it can be completely avoided by using
a deﬂected slow atomic beam for loading the MOT.

3.5. Inﬂuence of cold and ultracold atomic collisions

Interactions between the atoms in the laser-cooled ensemble, i. e., cold collisions, lead to a frequency shift
of the clock transition. The magnitude of the shift depends on the states of the two colliding atoms and their
separation, and results in a mean frequency shift that depends on the temperature and the density of the atomic
ensemble. For the low densities ( about 1016 m−3) in PTB’s ensemble, the frequency shift is assumed to be a
linear function of the collision rate, and hence of the density ρ. In order to determine the density dependence
of the frequency shift, the frequency diﬀerences were measured as a function of average density diﬀerences [11].
The density was varied by switching the repump laser at 672 nm (Fig. 1) on or oﬀ during the loading time of the
millikelvin ensemble. This changed the number of trapped atoms while all other parameters such as the magnetic
ﬁeld, loading time, frequency of the trapping light and laser-beam proﬁle were kept constant. The radius and
temperature of the trapped cloud were checked and did not change signiﬁcantly when the average density ∆ρ
was varied by a factor of ﬁve. The measurement of the collisional shift ∆ν/ν depending on the density ρ (Fig.
−30 m3 × ρ [11]. The corresponding frequency shift for the average density of the
3.4 a) gave ∆ν/ν = (3 ± 4.4) · 10
expanding ensemble when measuring at a resolution of 1.2 kHz (T = 215 µs) would be (1.2±1.8) Hz. Hence, within
the uncertainty of this measurement, no signiﬁcant shift has been observed. The same was true when microkelvin
−31 m3 × ρ was obtained. At
atoms were used (Fig. 3.4b) where an even lower limit of ∆ν/ν = (−0.4 ± 1.2) · 10
the usual densities at the PTB setup this would lead to a shift of (20 ± 60) mHz, while in the NIST setup the
densities and therefore also the shifts are lower by at least one order of magnitude. Within its uncertainty this
coeﬃcient is four orders of magnitude smaller than that seen in Cs-fountain clocks [46], which have nonetheless

achieved an uncertainty level of 10−15. Thus one sees the potential of this optical frequency standard to achieve
very low uncertainty levels while maintaining a very high stability with a high number of atoms (∼ 107).

3.6. Frequency measurements and uncertainty budget

Table 1 summarizes the results for the present uncertainty budget for frequency measurements with millikelvin
atoms in 2001 at PTB [47,13] and 2000 at NIST [38,48,3], as well as a recent frequency measurement with
microkelvin atoms in 2003 at PTB. While the measurements at NIST in 2000 were still limited by the unknown
eﬀect of cold collisions and the exact contributions by the Doppler eﬀect, the PTB measurements of 2001 were
limited by the blackbody shift (4.3 Hz) due to the oven being close to the atomic ensemble. This contribution
still dominates the uncertainty budget in PTB’s frequency measurement of 2003, while the Doppler eﬀect and
subsequently other phase contributions were further reduced by use of microkelvin atomic ensembles. A setup with
the oven removed from the vicinity of the trapped ensemble is currently being assembled. Asymmetries in the
excitation spectra that can lead to systematic frequency shifts when stabilizing the laser have been estimated as
well as measured [42] indicating a shift of less than 50 mHz with a 3f-stabilization scheme. The use of femtosecond-
laser frequency combs for the comparison against state-of-the-art Cs-fountain atomic clocks (and against the Hg+
single-ion frequency standard at NIST) allowed both groups to avoid being limited by either the primary time and
frequency standards or the statistical uncertainty of the comparison. The results are summarized in Fig. 11 together
with the ﬁrst frequency measurements of the Ca clock transition performed at the PTB, using phase-coherent
frequency multiplication chains [49,42]. The average over all measurements is ¯νCa = (455 986 240 494 150.2 ±
7.7) Hz. The latest measurement with microkelvin atoms performed at PTB in October 2003 resulted in νCa =
(455 986 240 494 144 ± 5.3) Hz. The results of all measurements agree well with the average value within their
respective uncertainties (see ﬁg. 11). This makes the Ca optical frequency standard with neutral atoms the best
such standard evaluated in more than one laboratory.

3.7. Projected uncertainty budget

The projected uncertainty budget in the last column of Table 1 is based on the present knowledge on the
system as presented in the above sections. Possibly, the dominating uncertainty contribution will result from the
correction needed for the room-temperature blackbody shift. The limit is due to the uncertainty in the correction.
Modelling of the atomic signal (see [25]) based on a description by Bord´e et al. [29] to correct for shifts due to
the asymmetries in the line shape (see Fig. 4) will allow one to quantify the shift more accurately. A correction
of the shift to within 2 % would reduce the uncertainty to 1 mHz.
Electronic stabilization to line center at a level better than 10

−6 has already been demonstrated in the NIST-7
thermal atomic Cs-clock [50]. An oﬀset from the line center due to drift of up to 10 Hz/s of the free-running laser
can be reduced to below one millihertz when two integrator stages and measurement cycles on the 10 ms range
are used (see [42] for a mathematical model describing such a stabilization scheme).

With 107 atoms conﬁned to a trap of radius 2 mm the present knowledge on density shifts would be suﬃcient
to make this uncertainty contribution negligible. Furthermore, local higher-order distortions of wave fronts on a
scale of 1 mm that cannot be clearly resolved by launching the ensemble would be averaged away over the size of
the trap. A 12 µK ensemble with an average velocity of less than 1 mm/s would enable one to achieve a negligible
residual ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect. Nevertheless a wave-front ﬂatness with Rd > 3000 m would need to be achieved
simultaneously and would certainly present a technical challenge.

The numbers given in the table are best-case estimates based on our present knowledge of what could be
achieved. Whether all these conditions can be simultaneously achieved, as would be required for a total combined
uncertainty below 10

−16, is subject to further investigation.

4. Conclusion

We have described the current status of the optical Ca frequency standard with laser-cooled neutral atoms as
realized in two diﬀerent laboratories for the purpose of developing a possible future optical atomic clock. Fre-
quency measurements performed make the frequency of the clock transition of 40Ca one of the best known optical
−14), and agree in both laboratories to well within their respective uncertainties.
frequencies (uncertainty 1.2 · 10
Furthermore, extensive investigations of systematics carried out in both laboratories do indicate that the presently
visible roadblocks are of a purely technical nature and that measurement capabilities to identify these shifts al-
ready exist. With the present knowledge of the properties of this frequency standard an attainable uncertainty
level of below 10

−16 can be anticipated.

Taking advantage of the unprecedented potential stability of 10−16 in 1 s that is feasible with this standard, the
systematic uncertainty level could be reached in a few seconds of measurement time. This would however require
a free running spectroscopy laser of low frequency noise during the 100 ms needed for a full stabilization cycle. In

10

case of white frequency noise this would correspond to a laser linewidth of less than 100 mHz.

Such a standard is a promising candidate not only for an application as a future atomic clock, but as well as a
versatile instrument for precision measurements including the search for variation of the fundamental constants
and the test of fundamental theories (e. g. see [51] and references therein).

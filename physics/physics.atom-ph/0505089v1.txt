We describe a nuclear spin gyroscope based on an alkali-metal–noble-gas co-magnetometer. An
optically pumped alkali-metal vapor is used to polarize the noble gas atoms and detect their gyro-
scopic precession. Spin precession due to magnetic ﬁelds as well as their gradients and transients
can be cancelled in this arrangement. The sensitivity is enhanced by using a high-density alkali-
metal vapor in a spin-exchange relaxation free (SERF) regime. With a K–3He co-magnetometer we

Sensitive gyroscopes ﬁnd a wide range of applications,
from inertial navigation to studies of Earth rotation and
tests of general relativity [1]. A variety of physical princi-
ples have been utilized for rotation sensing, including me-
chanical sensing, the Sagnac eﬀect for photons [1, 2] and
atoms [3, 4], the Josephson eﬀect in superﬂuid 4He and
3He [5] and nuclear spin precession [6]. While state-of-
the-art mechanical gyroscopes, such as those developed
for Gravity Probe B [7], remain unchallenged in terms
of sensitivity, their extremely high cost and diﬃculty of
fabrication motivate the development of simpler, smaller
and more robust rotation sensors.

Here we describe a new gyroscope based on nuclear
spin precession. Unlike the atom and photon interfer-
ometric gyroscopes based on the Sagnac eﬀect, nuclear
spin gyroscopes do not require a large area enclosed
by the interferometer and can be made quite compact.
Previous nuclear spin gyroscopes [6] have suﬀered from
high sensitivity to magnetic ﬁelds. We show that a co-
magnetometer using spin-polarized noble gas and alkali-
metal vapor can eliminate the sensitivity to magnetic
ﬁelds, their gradients and transients. High short-term
rotation sensitivity can be achieved with an alkali-metal
magnetometer operating in the SERF regime [8]. For ex-
ample, magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of 0.5 fT/Hz1/2 that has
been demonstrated in a K magnetometer [9] would result
in a rotation sensitivity of 1 × 10−8 rad/s/Hz1/2 in a K-
21Ne gyroscope. The bandwidth and transient response
of the gyroscope are also signiﬁcantly improved compared
with earlier spin gyroscopes by damping due to coupling
between noble gas and alkali-metal spins. We describe
an experimental implementation of the gyroscope using
K and 3He atoms and demonstrate short term rotation
sensitivity of 5 × 10−7 rad/sec/Hz1/2 with a sensing vol-
ume of only 0.5 cm3. We also present a theoretical anal-
ysis and experimental measurements of the gyroscope re-
sponse to various perturbations, and derive fundamental
limits for its performance.

The co-magnetometer consists of a spherical glass cell
containing an alkali metal, several atmospheres of noble
gas and a small quantity of nitrogen. Alkali atoms are
polarized by optical pumping and transfer the polariza-

tion to the noble gas nuclei by spin-exchange collisions.
A probe laser passes through the cell perpendicular to
the pump laser and measures the direction of the alkali-
metal polarization, which is strongly coupled to the nu-
clear polarization of the noble gas due to the imaginary
part of the spin-exchange cross-section. For suﬃciently
high buﬀer gas pressure in a spherical cell, this coupling
can be represented by an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld that one
spin species experiences from the average magnetization
of the other, B = λM, where λ = 8πκ0/3 [10]. Here
κ0 is an enhancement factor due to the attraction of the
electron wavefunction towards the noble gas nucleus and
ranges from about 5 to 600 for diﬀerent alkali-metal–
noble-gas pairs [11].

It was shown in [12] that the co-magnetometer is accu-
rately described by a system of coupled Bloch equations
for the electron and nuclear polarizations, Pe and Pn:

metal spins created by the light shift from pumping and

the pump and probe laser beams while sp and sm give
the directions and magnitudes of their photon spin polar-
izations. Re

rate for an alkali atom and Rn

lisions [14]. For alkali metal isotopes with I = 3/2 in the
regime of fast alkali-metal spin-exchange, Q(P e) ranges

The co-magnetometer is nominally conﬁgured with the
pump beam directed along the ˆz axis and the probe
beam directed along the ˆx axis. A compensating ﬁeld
B = Bc ˆz = −(Bn + Be)ˆz exactly cancels the ﬁeld due to
the magnetized atoms [12]. Here the eﬀective ﬁeld from
nuclear magnetization Bn = λM n
z is typically on the
order of a few mG and the eﬀective ﬁeld from the elec-
tron magnetization Be = λM e
z is on the order of a
few µG. The light shifts can be set to zero, L = 0, be-
cause the pump beam is tuned to the center of the optical
resonance and the probe beam is linearly polarized. Un-
der these conditions the gyroscope signal, proportional
to the optical rotation of the probe beam due to P e

Our experimental implementation of the gyroscope us-
ing K and 3He atoms is similar to the setup in [12] and is
depicted in Fig. 1. The ﬂoating optical table is equipped
with a piezo actuator to induce small rotations and 6
non-contact position sensors to measure the resulting ro-
tational motion. Feedback circuits were implemented to
control the wavelength and intensity of pump and probe
lasers. Magnetic ﬁelds and light shifts were periodically
zeroed using a modulation procedure described below.

the spin gyroscope compared with the angular velocity
Ωy obtained from the position sensors. The gyroscope
sensitivity was calibrated as described below and agreed
with mechanical measurements within the calibration ac-
curacy of 3%. We also veriﬁed that the gyroscope is in-
sensitive to the other two components of angular velocity.
The sensitivity of the gyroscope is shown in Fig. 3.
The angle random walk (ARW) is 0.002 deg/hour1/2 or
5 × 10−7 rad/s/Hz1/2 in the white noise region and cor-
responds to a magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of 2.5 fT/Hz1/2.
The low frequency angle drift of the gyroscope in the
present implementation is about 0.04 deg/hour.

To understand the eﬀects of various experimental im-
perfections it is important to consider small corrections
to Eq. (2). The only ﬁrst order dependence on the mag-
netic ﬁelds or light-shift ﬁelds comes from the Bx ﬁeld:

S(Bx) = BxP e

where the electron spin-exchange correction Ce

z ) and is on the order of 10−2. Because
(Re
electron and nuclear spin-exchange corrections are small
and Rtot ≪ γeBn, the ﬁeld sensitivity is suppressed by
a factor of 105 under typical conditions. Misalignment
of the pump and probe beams by an angle α away from

90◦ gives a signal S = αRp/Rtot. For typical condi-
tions, 1 µrad of misalignment gives a false rotation of
10−8 rad/sec. Misalignment can be distinguished from
a true rotation signal by its dependence on the pump-
ing rate Rp. Possible circular polarization of the probe
laser sm also gives a ﬁrst-order signal S = smRm/Rtot
but it can be set to zero by minimizing the light shift as
described below.

Other imperfections only aﬀect the signal to second
order in small quantities. For example, the signal due to
the By ﬁeld is given by

γeByP e
z

S(By) =

(Bz − (Bz + Lz)Ce

se − (2Bz + Lz)Cn
se)
(4)
where Bz is a small detuning away from the compensa-
tion ﬁeld Bc.
In addition to suppressing imperfections
by two small factors, such second order dependence al-
lows us to calibrate the co-magnetometer and provides a
mechanism for zeroing many oﬀsets. For example, to set
Bz to zero we apply a modulation to the By ﬁeld, mea-
sure the response as a function of Bz and ﬁnd the point
where it vanishes. The slope of the response is given by

The approximations in the last step are accurate to better
than 1% because under typical conditions Be ≪ Bn and
Ce
se ≪ 1. The measurement of the slope gives a cali-
bration of the gyroscope signal (2) in terms of the known
applied magnetic ﬁelds By, Bz and Bc. Most other ﬁeld,
light shift and alignment imperfections can be minimized
in a similar way with an appropriate choice of modula-
tion. For example, a term in the signal proportional to
LxLz allows us to minimize the light shifts of the pump
and probe beams by modulating one of them and adjust-
ing the other to get zero response. Since Lx ∝ sm, this
also minimizes the probe circular polarization.

The transient response of the gyroscope is also im-
proved in the co-magnetometer conﬁguration. In navi-
gation applications, the rotation frequency is integrated
over time to obtain the rotation angle. Using the Green’s
function for linearized Bloch equations [12], it can be
shown that the integral of the signal is proportional to
the total angle of mechanical rotation about the ˆy axis
independent of the time dependence of Ωy. Furthermore,
the net rotation angle generated by an arbitrary magnetic
ﬁeld transient is equal to zero as long as spin polariza-
tions are rotated by a small angle during the transient.
Fig. 4 shows the response of the gyroscope to a transient
magnetic ﬁeld spike, demonstrating reduction of the spin
rotation angle by a factor of 400 relative to an uncom-
pensated K magnetometer. For an oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld the largest contribution to the signal comes from the

The decay time Td is on the order of 0.1 sec and is not lim-

interactions with cell walls, which produce beats in spin
precession signal for isotopes with I > 1/2 on a time
scale (Rn

sd)−1 [15, 16] do not cause a signiﬁcant eﬀect.

The co-magnetometer also eﬀectively suppresses mag-
netic ﬁeld gradients even though alkali-metal and noble
gas polarizations have somewhat diﬀerent spatial dis-
tributions. The degree of nuclear polarization is very
uniform across the cell because the rate of diﬀusion
RD = D/a2, where D is the diﬀusion constant and a
is the radius of the cell, is much faster than Rn
sd. The
direction of nuclear polarization is parallel to the lo-
cal magnetic ﬁeld as long as the nuclear spin preces-
sion frequency γnBn ≫ RD [17]. Thus, nuclear mag-
netization largely cancels the non-uniform external ﬁeld
point-by-point. The limits of this cancellation are deter-
mined by the degree of nuclear spin misalignment given
by RD/γnBn and the local variation in Bc due to non-
uniform alkali-metal polarization, on the order of Be/Bn.
Both eﬀects are on the order of 10−3 under typical condi-
tions. We measured the sensitivity to ﬁrst order magnetic
ﬁeld gradients using internal gradient coils. The quasi-
static signals from gradient ﬁelds are suppressed relative
to Sg = γe|∇B|aP e

z /Rtot by a factor of 500 to 5000.

The fundamental limit on gyroscope sensitivity is due
to spin projection noise. We performed a quantum tra-
jectory simulation of the coupled spin system (1) to
show that for most parameters the measurement un-
certainty is dominated by the alkali-metal spins. The
rotational uncertainty per unit bandwidth is given by
δΩy = (γn/γe)[Q(P e)Rtot/nV ]1/2 where n is the den-
sity of alkali-metal atoms and V is the measurement vol-
21Ne gives the best fundamental sensitivity and
ume.
suppression of systematic eﬀects because it has a small
gyromagnetic ratio γn, ten times smaller than 3He. Using
the K-21Ne spin relaxation cross-section measured in [18]
we estimate the fundamental sensitivity to be 2 × 10−10
rad/sec/Hz1/2 for a measurement volume of 10 cm3, K
density of 1014 cm−3 and 21Ne density of 3 × 1020 cm−3.
Detection of oﬀ-resonant optical rotation allows one to
approach the spin projection noise even with imperfect
detectors by making a quantum-non-demolition measure-
ment of the alkali-metal spin in an optically-thick vapor.
For comparison, gyroscopes utilizing the Sagnac eﬀect
have achieved sensitivities of 2 × 10−10 rad/sec/Hz1/2 us-
ing a ring laser with an enclosed area of 1 m2 [19] and
6 × 10−10 rad/sec/Hz1/2 using an atomic inteferometer
with a path length of 2 m [20]. More compact atomic
inteferometers using cold atoms that are presently be-
ing developed have a projected shot-noise sensitivity of
3 × 10−8 rad/sec/Hz1/2 [4] and 2 × 10−9 rad/sec/Hz1/2
[21]. Compact state-of-the-art ﬁber-optic gyroscopes
have a reported sensitivity of 2 × 10−8 rad/sec/Hz1/2
[22]. Thus, the gyroscope described here is promising as
a compact rotation sensor that can rival existing tech-
nologies.
It’s relative simplicity makes it amenable to
miniaturization with techniques developed for compact

4

atomic clocks [23]. Many aspects of the system, such
as magnetic shielding and mechanical stability will im-
prove with smaller size. Small size and fast transient
response may also allow reduction of the gyroscope long-
term drifts using active rotation techniques [24].

In conclusion, we have described the operation and per-
formance of a K–3He co-magnetometer gyroscope. It has
a high short term sensitivity with a small measurement
volume and is insensitive to external perturbations. Fur-
ther improvement is possible by switching to 21Ne gas
and improving the sensitivity of optical rotation measure-
ments at low frequencies to approach the spin-projection
noise. We thank Tom Jackson, Igor Savukov, Charles

Abstract. The structure of the excited 23S and 23P triplet states of 3He and 4He in an applied magnetic
ﬁeld B is studied using diﬀerent approximations of the atomic Hamiltonian. All optical transitions (line
positions and intensities) of the 1083 nm 23S-23P transition are computed as a function of B. The eﬀect
of metastability exchange collisions between atoms in the ground state and in the 23S metastable state is
studied, and rate equations are derived, for the populations these states in the general case of an isotopic
mixture in an arbitrary ﬁeld B. It is shown that the usual spin-temperature description remains valid. A
simple optical pumping model based on these rate equations is used to study the B-dependence of the
population couplings which result from the exchange collisions. Simple spectroscopy measurements are
performed using a single-frequency laser diode on the 1083 nm transition. The accuracy of frequency scans
and of measurements of transition intensities is studied. Systematic experimental veriﬁcations are made
for B=0 to 1.5 T. Optical pumping eﬀects resulting from hyperﬁne decoupling in high ﬁeld are observed
to be in good agreement with the predictions of the simple model. Based on adequately chosen absorption
measurements at 1083 nm, a general optical method to measure the nuclear polarisation of the atoms in
the ground state in an arbitrary ﬁeld is described. It is demonstrated at B
0.1 T, a ﬁeld for which the
usual optical methods could not operate.

1 Introduction

Highly polarised 3He is used for several applications in
various domains, for instance to prepare polarised targets
for nuclear physics experiments [1], to obtain spin ﬁlters
for cold neutrons [2,3], or to perform magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of air spaces in human lungs [4,5]. A very
eﬃcient and widely used polarisation method relies on op-
tical pumping of the 23S metastable state of helium with
1083 nm resonant light [6,7]. Transfer of nuclear polarisa-
tion to atoms in the ground state is ensured by metastabil-
ity exchange collisions. Optical Pumping (OP) is usually
performed in low magnetic ﬁeld (up to a few mT), required
only to prevent fast relaxation of the optically prepared
orientation. OP can provide high nuclear polarisation, up
to 80% [8], but eﬃciently operates only at low pressure (of
order 1 mbar) [9]. Eﬃcient production of large amounts
of polarised gas is a key issue for most applications, which
often require a dense gas. For instance, polarised gas must
be at atmospheric pressure to be inhaled in order to per-

form lung MRI. Adding a neutral buﬀer gas after comple-
tion of OP is a simple method to increase pressure, but
results in a large dilution of the polarised helium. Polari-
sation preserving compression of the helium gas after OP
using diﬀerent compressing devices is now performed by
several research groups [10,11,12], but it is a demanding
technique and no commercial apparatus can currently be
used to obtain the large compression ratio required by
most applications.

Improving the eﬃciency of OP at higher pressure is a
direct way to obtain larger magnetisation densities. Such
an improvement was shown to be suﬃcient to perform
lung MRI in humans [13]. It could also facilitate sub-
sequent mechanical compression by signiﬁcantly reduc-
ing the required compression ratio and pumping speed. It
was achieved by operating OP in a higher magnetic ﬁeld
(0.1 T) than is commonly used. High ﬁeld OP in 3He had
been previously reported at 0.1 T [14] and 0.6 T [15], but
the worthwhile use of high ﬁelds for OP at high pressures
(tens of mbar) had not been reported until recently [16].

An important eﬀect of a high enough magnetic ﬁeld
is to strongly reduce the inﬂuence of hyperﬁne coupling
in the structures of the diﬀerent excited levels of helium.

2

E. Courtade et al.: The 1083 nm Helium Transition in High Magnetic Field

In order to populate the 23S metastable state and per-
form OP, a plasma discharge is sustained in the helium
gas. In the various atomic and molecular excited states
which are populated in the plasma, hyperﬁne interaction
transfers nuclear orientation to electronic spin and orbital
orientations. The electronic angular momentum is in turn
converted into circular polarisation of the emitted light
or otherwise lost during collisions. This process is actu-
ally put to use in the standard optical detection technique
[8,17] in which the circular polarisation of a chosen helium
spectral line emitted by the plasma is measured and the
nuclear polarisation is inferred. The decoupling eﬀect of
an applied magnetic ﬁeld unfortunately reduces the sen-
sitivity of the standard optical detection method above
10 mT, and hence a diﬀerent measurement technique must
be used in high ﬁelds. This transfer of orientation also has
an adverse eﬀect in OP situations by inducing a net loss
of nuclear polarisation in the gas. The decoupling eﬀect
of an applied ﬁeld reduces this polarisation loss and may
thus signiﬁcantly improve the OP performance in situ-
ations of limited eﬃciency, such as low temperatures or
high pressures. At low temperature (4.2 K), a reduced
metastability exchange cross section sets a tight bottle-
neck and strongly limits the eﬃciency of OP [18,19,20] ; a
ﬁeld increase from 1 to 40 mT was observed to provide an
increase in nuclear polarisation from 17 % to 29 % in this
situation [21]. At high gas pressures (above a few mbar)
the proportion of metastable atoms is reduced and the
creation of metastable molecular species is enhanced, two
factors which tend to reduce the eﬃciency of OP ; it is
not surprising that a signiﬁcant improvement is obtained
by suppressing relaxation channels in high ﬁeld [16].

A systematic investigation of various processes rele-
vant for OP in non-standard conditions (high ﬁeld and/or
high pressure) has been made, and results will be reported
elsewhere [22,23]. As mentioned earlier, an optical mea-
surement method of nuclear polarisation in arbitrary ﬁeld
must be developed. It is based on absorption measure-
ments of a probe beam, and requires a detailed knowledge
of magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects on the 1083 nm transition lines.
In this article we report on a detailed study of the eﬀect of
an applied magnetic ﬁeld on the structure of the 23S and
23P atomic levels, both in 3He and 4He. In the theoreti-
cal section we ﬁrst present results obtained using a simple
eﬀective Hamiltonian and discuss the accuracy of com-
puted line positions and intensities at various magnetic
ﬁelds, then discuss the eﬀect of an applied ﬁeld on the
metastability exchange collisions between the 23S state
and the 11S0 ground state level of helium. In the experi-
mental section we present results of measurements of the
line positions and intensities up to 1.5 T, then describe an
optical measurement technique of the nuclear polarisation
of 3He.

Let us ﬁnally mention that these studies have been
principally motivated by OP developments, but that their
results could be of interest to design or interpret experi-
ments performed on helium atoms in the 23S or 23P state
in an applied ﬁeld, as long as metrological accuracy is not
required. This includes laser cooling and Zeeman slowing

[24] of a metastable atom beam, magnetic trapping and
evaporative cooling which recently allowed two groups to
obtain Bose Einstein condensation with metastable 4He
atoms [25,26], and similar experiments which may probe
the inﬂuence of Fermi statistics with ultracold metastable
3He atoms.

vals have been computed and measured with a steadily
improved accuracy [27,28], in order to provide a test of
QED calculations and to measure the ﬁne-structure con-
stant α. High precision isotope shift measurements of the
23S—23P transition of helium have also been performed
to further test QED calculations and to probe the 3He
nuclear charge radius with atomic physics experiments
[29]. High precision measurements and calculations of the
Zeeman eﬀect in the 23P state of helium have also been
performed [30,31,32]. They were required in particular to
analyse the results of ﬁne-structure intervals measured us-

ing microwave transitions in an applied magnetic ﬁeld in
4He [33] and 3He [34].

All this work has produced a wealth of data which may
now be used to compute the level structures and transi-
tion probabilities with a very high accuracy up to high
magnetic ﬁelds (several Tesla), in spite of a small per-
sisting disagreement between theory and experiments for
the g-factor of the Zeeman eﬀect in the 23P state [32,35].
However, such accurate computation can be very time-
consuming, especially for 3He in which ﬁne-structure, hy-
perﬁne and Zeeman interaction terms of comparable im-
portance have to be considered. A simpliﬁed approach was
proposed by the Yale group [36], based on the use of an
eﬀective Hamiltonian. The hyperﬁne mixing of the 23P
and singlet 21P states is the only one considered in this
eﬀective Hamiltonian, and its parameters have been ex-
perimentally determined [34]. A theoretical calculation of
the 3He 23P structure with an accuracy of order 1 MHz
later conﬁrmed the validity of this phenomenological ap-
proach [37]. In the present article, we propose a further
simpliﬁcation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian introduced by
the Yale group, in which couplings to the singlet states are
not explicitely considered. Instead we implicitely take into
account these coupling terms, at least in part, by using the
23P splittings measured in zero ﬁeld to set the eigenvalues
of the ﬁne-structure matrices.

Results obtained using this simpliﬁed eﬀective Hamil-
tonian will be compared in section 2.1.3 to those of the one
including the couplings to the 21P levels, with 3 or 6 addi-
tional magnetic sublevels, depending on the isotope. The
eﬀect of additional terms in a more elaborate form of the
Zeeman Hamiltonian [32] than the linear approximation
which we use will also be evaluated.

2.1 A simple eﬀective Hamiltonian

2.1.1 Notations

The 11S ground level of helium is a singlet spin state
(S=0), with no orbital angular momentum (L=0), and
hence has no total electronic angular momentum (J=0).
In 3He, the nucleus thus carries the only angular momen-
tum I, giving rise to the two magnetic sublevels mI =
1/2.
Their relative populations, (1
M ) /2, deﬁne the nuclear
polarisation M of the ground state.

±
The level structure of 4He excited states is determined
from the ﬁne-structure term and the Zeeman term in the
Hamiltonian. The ﬁne-structure term Hf s is easily ex-
pressed in the total angular momentum representation (J)
using parameters given in tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix.
For the Zeeman term in the applied magnetic ﬁeld B we
shall use the simple linear form :

states at any ﬁeld. For the 23P state the Zeeman term

same mJ ) and is more easily expressed in the decoupled

the following, we similarly call Y1 to Y3 the 3 sublevels of
the 23S state.

tions. The ﬁne-structure term Hf s is expressed in the to-

1 There is a diﬀerence with notations used in reference [7] :
within each level of given F, labeling of state names was in-
creased for convenience from largest to lower values of mF . In
an applied ﬁeld, this would correspond to an energy decrease
inside each of the F levels (except the P0, F =1/2 level). This
is the reason for the new labelling convention, which is more
convenient in an applied ﬁeld.

contribution is adjusted to obtain the precisely measured
C9-D2 interval (810.599 MHz, [29]).

2.1.2 Numerical Results

Numerical computation of level structure and absorption
spectra in an applied ﬁeld B is performed in 3 steps. Matri-
ces H9 (for 4He), H6 and H18 (for 3He) are computed ﬁrst.
A standard matrix diagonalisation package (the double-
precision versions of the jacobi and eigsrt routines [41]) is
then used to compute and sort all eigenvalues (energies)
and eigenvectors (components of the atomic states in the
decoupled bases). All transition matrix elements T (4)
ij and
Tij are ﬁnally evaluated, and results are output to ﬁles for
further use or graphic display. Actual computation time
is insigniﬁcant (e.g. 20 ms per value of B on a PC using
a compiled Fortran program [42]), so that we chose not
to use the matrix symmetries to reduce the matrix sizes
and the computational load, in contrast with references
[36,37]. We thus directly obtain all transitions of the 1083
nm line: 19 transitions for 4He (6 for σ+ and for σ−, 7
for π light polarisation), and 70 transitions for 3He (22 for
σ+ and for σ−, 26 for π light polarisation). These num-
bers are reduced for B=0 to 18 for 4He (the Y2 →
Z7,
π transition has a null probability) and to
i.e.
1; 0
64 for 3He (the F =1/2
F =5/2 transitions, from A5 or
A6 to any of B1 to B6 are forbidden by selection rules).
Due to level degeneracy, the usual D0, D1and D2 lines of
4He, and C1 to C9 lines of 3He [7] are obtained for B=0
(ﬁgure 3, and table 9 in the Appendix).

An applied magnetic ﬁeld removes level degeneracies
(Zeeman splittings appear) and modiﬁes the atomic states
and hence the optical transition probabilities. Examples
of level Zeeman energy shifts are shown in ﬁgure 4 for
the 23S state and the highest-lying 23P levels (originating
from the 23P0 state at low ﬁeld). In the 23S state, the
two Zeeman splittings are simply proportional to B (28
GHz/T) for 4He, as inferred from equation 1. For 3He,
signiﬁcant deviations from linearity occur for A2, A3 and
A5 above a ﬁeld of order 0.1 T, for which Zeeman shifts
are signiﬁcant compared to the hyperﬁne splitting. Level

pled regime is almost reached for 1.5 T (ﬁgure 4, bottom).
Analytical expression for state energies and components
on the decoupled
basis are given in the Ap-
pendix (equations A10 to A17). In the 23P state, the sit-
uation is more complex due to ﬁne-structure interactions
and to the larger number of levels. In particular no level
remains unaﬀected by B in contrast with the situation for
Y2. As a result, π transitions in 4He from Y2 to Z3 or
Z9 have non-zero Zeeman frequency shifts, which are pro-
portional to B2 at low and moderate ﬁeld although they
originate from the linear Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian
(equation 1). Even the 23P0 states, for which level mixing
is weakest due to the large ﬁne-structure gap, experience
signiﬁcant ﬁeld eﬀects (ﬁgure 4, top and top insert). The
splitting between B17 and B18 (2.468 GHz/T at low ﬁeld)
is only weakly aﬀected by the nuclear term in equation 5
16.2 MHz/T), and mostly results from level mixing and
(
±
electronic Zeeman eﬀects.

Examples of optical transition intensities and Zeeman
frequency shifts are shown in ﬁgure 5 for 4He (π light
polarisation). Shifts of transition frequencies are clearly
visible on the projection onto the base plane, the usual
Zeeman diagram (in which no line crossing occurs). Large
changes are also induced by the applied ﬁeld on the transi-
tion probabilities. In particular, the forbidden D1transition
(Y2 →
Z7) has a matrix element which linearly increases
at low ﬁeld (T (4)
), and approaches 1 in high ﬁeld

The splittings of the C8 and C9 lines of 3He at mod-
erate ﬁeld are displayed in ﬁgure 6. Circularly polarised
light, which is used in OP experiments to deposit angular
momentum in the gas, is more eﬃciently absorbed for σ−
polarisation when a ﬁeld is applied. This can tentatively
be related to results of our OP experiments : at B=0.1 T,
the most eﬃcient pumping line is actually found to be
C9, σ−. OP results at B=0.6 T reported in reference [15]
also indicate that σ− polarisation is more eﬃcient, in spite
of ﬂuorescence measurements suggesting an imperfect po-
larisation of the light. One must however note that OP
eﬃciency does not only depend on light absorption, and
that level structures and metastability exchange collisions
(which will be discussed below) also play a key role. Let us

2.1.3 Discussion

To assess the consequences of the main approximation in
our calculations, namely the restriction of the Hamilto-
nian to the triplet 23P conﬁguration, we have made a sys-
tematic comparison to the results of the full calculation
including singlet-triplet mixing.

In the case of 4He, exact energies are of course obtained
for B=0, and level energy diﬀerences do not exceed 1 kHz
for B=2 T. This very good agreement results from the
fact that the lowest order contribution of the singlet ad-
mixture in the 23P state to the Zeeman eﬀect is a third
order perturbation [30,45]. For similar reasons, computed
transition probabilities are also almost identical, and our
simple calculation is perfectly adequate for most purposes
if the proper parameters of table 5 in the Appendix are
used.

For 3He we have compared the results of the full cal-
culation involving all 24 sublevels in the 2P states as de-
scribed by the Yale group [36] and two forms of the sim-
pliﬁed calculation restricted to the 18 sublevels of the 23P
state. The simpler form only contains the contact interac-
tion term API
S in the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian of equa-
tion 6. The more complete calculations makes use of the
full hyperﬁne interaction, with the correction term H cor
hf s
introducing two additional parameters, d and e.

·

The simpler 1-parameter calculation is similar to the
zero-ﬁeld calculation of reference [7] (with updated values
of all energy parameters), and provides a limited accuracy
as shown in ﬁgure 7. Errors on the computed energies of

magnetic ﬁeld intensities. Large changes of the errors occur
close to level anticrossings (e.g. mF =1/2 B15 and B17 levels
close to 1.18 T, see ﬁgure 4).

·

the levels of several tens of MHz cannot be signiﬁcantly re-
duced by adjusting AP to a more appropriate value. This
is a direct evidence that the correction term H cor
hf s unam-
biguously modiﬁes the energy level diagram, with clear

ﬁeld-dependent signatures at moderate ﬁeld and around
1 T. Errors on the transition matrix elements up to a few
10−3 also result from neclecting H cor
hf s. Using this simple 1-
parameter form of the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian should thus
be avoided when a better accuracy is desired.

The 3-parameter calculation has also been compared
to the full calculation, and a slight adjustement of pa-
rameters AP, d and e with respect to the corresponding
parameters C, D/2 and E/5 of the full calculation (which
also includes the oﬀ-diagonal parameter C′ [36]), now pro-
vides a more satisfactory agreement for the level energies,
shown in ﬁgure 8. Transitions matrix elements Tij are also

ment may eﬀectively represent part of the oﬀ-diagonal ef-
fects in the singlet admixture, and allows to decrease the
energy errors, especially below 1 T (by a factor 2-3).

×

The other important approximation in our calculations
is related to the simpliﬁcations in the Zeeman Hamiltonian
written in equations 1 and 5. The ﬁrst neglected term is
the non-diagonal contribution proportional to the small
parameter gx in equation A1. The non-zero elements of
this additional contribution are of order µBBgx/5, i.e. 1-
2 MHz/T in frequency units. The other neglected term
results from the quadratic Zeeman eﬀect [30,32,45], which
introduces matrix elements of order (µBB)2 /R∞ (R∞ =
106 GHz stands for the Rydberg constant in fre-
3.29
quency units), i.e. 60 kHz/T2. For most applications, and
in particular for the experimental situations considered in
the following, corrections introduced by these additional

terms in the Zeeman Hamiltonian would indeed be negli-
gible, not larger for instance than the errors in ﬁgure 8.

2.2 Metastability exchange

So far we have only addressed the eﬀects of an applied
magnetic ﬁeld on the level energies and structures of the
23S and 23P states of helium, and the consequences for the
1083 nm optical transition. In this section we now consider
the eﬀect of the applied ﬁeld on the angular momentum
transfer between atoms during the so-called metastability
exchange (ME) collisions, which are spin-exchange binary
collisions between an atom in the ground state and one
in the metastable 23S state. They play an important role
in all experimental situations where the atoms in the 23S
state are a minority species in a plasma (e.g. with a num-
ber density 1010–1011 cm−3 compared to 2.6
1016 for the
total density of atoms at 1 mbar in typical OP conditions).
These collisions may be neglected only for experiments on
atomic beams or trapped atoms for which radiative forces
are used to separate the metastable atoms from the much
denser gas of atoms in the ground state.

×

To describe the statistical properties of a mixture of
ground state and 23S state atoms we shall use a standard
density operator formalism and extend the treatment in-
troduced by Partridge and Series [46] for ME collisions,
later improved [47,48] and used for an OP model [7], to
the case of an arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld. Our ﬁrst goal is
to show that the “spin temperature” concept [49,50,7] re-
mains valid, and that the population distribution in the
23S state is fully determined (in the absence of OP and of
relaxation) by the nuclear polarisation M of the ground
state. This is the result on which the optical detection
method of section 3.3 relies. The second goal is to provide
a formalism allowing to study the consequences of hyper-
ﬁne decoupling on spin transfer during ME collisions.

2.2.1 Derivation of rate equations

We shall consider situations in which no resonance is driven
between the two magnetic sublevels of the ground state of
3He (the ground state of 4He has no structure) nor be-
tween sublevels of the 23S state. We can thus a priori
assume that the density operators ρg (in the ground state
of 3He), ρ3 (in the 23S state of 3He) and ρ4 (in the 23S
state of 4He) are statistical mixtures of eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian. The corresponding density matrices are thus
diagonal and contain only populations (no coherences).

An important feature of ME in helium is that in prac-
tice no depolarisation occurs during the collisions, due to
the fact that all involved angular momenta are spins [48].
Three kinds of ME collisions occur in an isotopic mixture,
depending on the nature of the colliding atoms (3He or
4He) and on their excitation state (ground state: 3,4He,
23S state: 3,4He

The partial trace operations in equations 14 to 17
do not introduce any coherence term in density matri-
ces. In contrast, the tensor products in equations 15 and
18 introduce several oﬀ-diagonal terms. These are driving
terms which may lead to the development of coherences
in the density operators, but we shall show in the fol-
lowing that they can usually be neglected. Since mF is
a good quantum number, oﬀ-diagonal terms in the ten-
sor products only appear between 2 states of equal mF .
With the state names deﬁned in the Appendix (table 12),
these oﬀ-diagonal terms are proportional to the operators

states of equal mF .

The time evolution of the density operators due to ME
collisions is obtained from a detailed balance of the de-
parture and arrival processes for the 3 kinds of collisions.
This is similar to the method introduced by Dupont-Roc
et al. [47] to derive a rate equation for ρg and ρ3 in pure
3He at low magnetic ﬁeld. It is extended here to isotopic
mixtures, and the eﬀect of an arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld is
discussed.

The contribution of ME collisions to a rate equation
for the density operator ρ3 of the 23S state 3He is ob-
tained computing an ensemble average in the gas of the
terms arising from collisions with a 3He atom (collision
type 1, ﬁrst line of the rate equation) and and from col-
lisions involving diﬀerent isotopes (types 2 and 3, second
line):

section, v33 and v34 are the relative velocities of collid-
ing atoms. The ensemble averaging procedure must take
into account the time evolution between collisions. For
non-resonant phenomena, one is interested in steady-state
situations, or in using rate equations to compute slow evo-
lutions of the density operators (compared to the ME col-
lision rate 1/τ ). For the constant or slowly varying pop-
ulations (ρ3, diagonal terms in ρ′
3 ), the ensemble
averages simply introduce the usual thermally averaged
quantities σv33,34. For each time-dependent oﬀ-diagonal
coherence, the average of the fast precessing phase involves

The ME collision rate 1/τ is proportional to the helium
106 s−1/mbar in pure 3He at room
pressure (e.g. 3.75
temperature [51]). The splittings ∆E±/~ are equal to the
hyperﬁne splitting (6.74 GHz) in zero ﬁeld, and their vari-
ation with B can be derived from equations A10 and A11:
∆E+/~ increases with B while ∆E−/~ initially decreases
slightly (down to 6.35 GHz at 0.08 T), and both splittings
increase linearly with B at high ﬁeld (with a slope of or-
der 27.7 GHz/T). Under such conditions, ∆E±τ /~>1000
in a gas at 1 mbar. All coherences can thus be safely ne-
glected in equation 19 which, when restricted to its diag-
onal terms, can be written as:

The main diﬀerences with the result derived in [47] are
the additional term (second line) in equation 21, which re-
4He collisions, and the replacement
ﬂects the eﬀect of 3He
of the projectors on the F substates by the more general
projectors Πi on the eigenstates in the applied ﬁeld B.
Considering the ﬁeld dependence of the frequency split-
tings ∆E±/~, the condition on the ME collision rate 1/τ
is only slightly more stringent at 0.08 T that for B=0,
but can be considerably relaxed at high magnetic ﬁeld.
The linear increase of ∆E± and the 1/B decrease of sin θ±
(see ﬁgure 31) in the common factor of all coherences pro-
vide a B2 increase of the acceptable collision rate, and
hence of the operating pressure, for which coherences can
be neglected in all density matrices, and equations 11 to
13 are valid.

The other rate equations are directly derived from equa-
tions 14, 16 and 17. Since there is no tensor product, hence
no coherence source term in the relevant arrival terms, ex-
plicit ensemble averages are not required and the contri-
bution of ME is:

as expected since the three ME processes preserve the to-
tal number of atoms in the 23S excited state.

2.2.2 Steady-state solutions

Total rate equations can be obtained by adding relaxation
and OP terms to the ME terms of equations 21 and 23.
They can be used to compute steady-state density ma-
trices for the 23S state, while the nuclear polarisation M
(and hence ρg) may have a very slow rate of change (com-
pared to th ME collision rate 1/τ ). In these steady-state
situations, the contribution of ME collisions to the total
rate equations for the 23S state just compensates the OP
and relaxation contributions. Since the latter are traceless
terms (OP and relaxation only operate population trans-
fers between sublevels of a given isotope), by taking the
trace of equation 21 or 23 one ﬁnds that the 23S state
and ground state number densities have the same isotopic
ratio R:

R = n4/n3 = N4/N3.

(25)

10

E. Courtade et al.: The 1083 nm Helium Transition in High Magnetic Field

This results from having implicitely assumed in section 2.2.1
that all kinds of collisions have the same ME cross sec-
tion2. In fact destruction and excitation of of the 23S
state in the gas may diﬀerently aﬀect 3He and 4He atoms,
e.g. due to the diﬀerent diﬀusion times to the cell walls.
However in practice this has little eﬀect compared to the
very frequent ME collisions, which impose the condition
of equation 25 for number densities.

To obtain simpler expressions for the rate equations,

we introduce the parameters:

1/τe = N3σv33 + N4σv34
1/Te = n3σv33 + n4σv34

µ = σv33/σv34

(26)
(27)
(28)

The rates 1/Te and 1/τe correspond to the total ME col-
lision rate for a 3He atom in the ground state and in the
23S state respectively; in steady state, equation 25 can be
used to show that τe/Te = n3/N3 = n4/N4. Since the ther-
mal velocity distributions simply scale with the reduced
masses of colliding atoms, the value of the dimensionless
parameter µ can be evaluated from the energy dependence
of σ. From reference [18] one can estimate µ
1.07 at room
temperature. Rewriting equation 26 as:

≃

1/τe = (N3 + N4) σv33

(29)

1 + R/µ
1 + R

,

the ME rate in an isotopic mixture thus diﬀers from that
in pure 3He by at most 7 % (at large R) for a given total
density.

tion 25), the contributions of ME to rate equations be-

2.2.3 Spin temperature distributions

Anderson et al. [49] have proposed that, under some con-
ditions including fast spin exchange, the relative popula-
tions of sublevels should follow a Boltzmann-like distribu-
tion in angular momentum. This was explicitely veriﬁed
for pure 3He in low ﬁeld [7], and will now be shown for
isotopic mixtures and arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld. In situa-
tions where OP and relaxation processes have negligible
eﬀect on populations, the steady-state density operators
are easily derived from the rate equations 30 to 32:

ρg = Tre ρ3
ρ4 = Trn ρ3

Simply assuming that the populations ai in the 23S state
of 3He only depend on the mF values in the states Ai,
one can directly check using equations A14 to A17 that
both Tre ρ3 (and hence equations 30 and 33) and Trn ρ3
do not depend on B. Noting eβ the ratio (1+M )/(1-M )
of the populations in the ground state (1/β plays the role
of a spin temperature), one derives from equation 38 that
the ratios of populations in the 23S state of 3He are ﬁeld-
independent, and given by eβ∆mF . These populations thus
have the same distribution at all magnetic ﬁelds:

ai = eβmF /(e3β/2 + 2eβ/2 + 2e−β/2 + e−3β/2).

(39)

Using equations 37 and A14 to A17, the populations in
the 23S state of 4He are in turn found to obey a similar
distribution:

yi = eβmS /(eβ + 1 + e−β).

2.2.4 OP eﬀects on populations

The general problem of computing all the atomic popu-
lations in arbitrary conditions is not considered in this
work. It has been addressed in the low ﬁeld limit using
speciﬁc models in pure 3He [7] and in isotopic mixtures
[52]. Here we extend it to arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds, but
only consider the particular situation where there is no
ground state nuclear polarisation (M =0). It can be met
in absorption spectroscopy experiments, in which a weak
probing light beam may induce a deviation from the uni-
form population distribution imposed by M =0 (inﬁnite
spin temperature). We shall assume in the following that
the OP process results from a depopulation mechanism in
which population changes are created only by excitation
of atoms from selected 23S sublevels and not by sponta-
neous emission from the 23P state (where populations are
randomised by fast relaxation processes). In 3He, this de-
population mechanism has been checked to dominate for
pressures above

1 mbar [6,7].

Under such conditions, and further assuming that Zee-
man splittings are large enough for a single sublevel in
the 23S state to be pumped (Ap or Yp, depending on the
probed isotope), the OP contribution to the time evolu-
tion of populations has a very simple form. Given the ME
contribution of equation 34 or 35, the total rate equation
for the pumped isotope becomes:

where 1/τp is the pumping rate (equation 2 or 8) and
δ(i, p)=1 if the level Ai or Yi is the pumped level, 0 oth-
erwise. In steady state, the relative populations can be
obtained from the kernel of the 9
9 matrix representa-
tion of the set of rate equations 34 and 42, or 35 and 41.
When a 3He line is probed, the 4He relative popula-
tions yi are fully imposed by ME processes only (equa-
tion 34), and can be subsituted in equation 42. The rela-
tive populations ai can then be obtained as the kernel of a
6 matrix which depends on the pumped level index p,
6
×
on the reduced pumping rate τe/τp and on the magnetic
ﬁeld B, but not on the isotopic ratio R (as discussed at
the end of the Appendix). Results showing the decrease
of the pumped population ap, and hence of the absorp-
tion of the incident light, are displayed in ﬁgure 9 as a
function of B. A strong absorption decrease is found at
high B, due to larger population changes induces by OP
when ME less eﬃciently transfers the angular momentum
to the ground state (let us recall that we assume M =0,
so that the ground state is a reservoir of inﬁnite spin tem-
perature). Population changes are found to be weaker for
the two states Al

populations turns out to vary with the isotopic ratio R.
However, the OP eﬀects are found to depend mostly on
the product Rτe/τp, as shown in ﬁgure 10 in the case of
the state Y3 (mS=1). This inﬂuence of the isotopic com-
position extends over a wide ﬁeld range, which justiﬁes the
use of isotopic mixtures to reduce the bias resulting from
OP eﬀects in our systematic quantitative measurements
of 4He line intensities. Figure 11 displays a comparison
of computed OP eﬀects for the 3 sublevels of the 4He 23S
states. Results for the populations y1 and y3 are quite sim-
ilar, except at large R. Weaker OP eﬀects are found for
the population y2, for which mS=0. This feature is similar
to the weaker OP eﬀects found in 3He for the two states
1/2 as main angular momenta
which have mS=0, mI =
components in high ﬁeld (see ﬁgure 9).

3 Experimental

In this part we present experimental results of laser ab-
sorption experiments probing the ﬁne, hyperﬁne and Zee-
man splittings of the 1083 nm transition in 3He and 4He.
Accurate microwave measurements [27,33,34] and high pre-
cision laser spectroscopy experiments [28,29,43,53] are usu-
ally performed on helium atomic beams. In contrast, we
have made unsophisticated absorption measurements us-
ing a single free-running laser diode on helium gas in cells
at room temperature, under the usual operating condi-
tions for nuclear polarisation of 3He by OP. An important
consequence of these conditions is the Doppler broadening

are ∆3=1.19 GHz and ∆4=1.03 GHz (the full widths at
half maximum, FWHM, given by 2∆√ln 2, are respec-

tively 1.98 and 1.72 GHz). The narrow Lorentzian res-
onant absorption proﬁles (with widths Γ ′/2) in equations

proﬁles are obtained for isolated lines in standard absorp-
tion experiments. For Γ ′

on Doppler-free absorption measurements from which a
good determination of frequency splittings is obtained,
then on integrated absorption intensities in diﬀerent mag-
netic ﬁelds. We ﬁnally demonstrate that absorption mea-
surements may provide a convenient determination of the
nuclear polarisation M .

helium gas samples are enclosed in sealed cylindrical Pyrex
glass cells, 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length. Cells are
ﬁlled after a careful cleaning procedure: bakeout at 700 K
under high vacuum for several days, followed by 100 W RF
(27 MHz) or microwave (2.4 GHz) discharges in helium
with frequent gas changes until only helium lines are de-
tected in the plasma ﬂuorescence. Most results presented
here have been recorded in cells ﬁlled with 0.53 mbar of
3He or helium mixture (25% 3He, 75% 4He). Diﬀerent gas
samples (from 0.2 to 30 mbar, from 10% to 100% 3He)
have also been used to study the eﬀect of pressure and
isotopic composition on the observed signals. A weak RF
discharge (<1 W at 3 MHz) is used to populate the 23S
state in the cell during absorption measurements. The RF
excitation is obtained using a pair of external electrodes.
Aligning the RF electric ﬁeld with B provides a higher
density of 23S states and better OP results in high mag-
netic ﬁeld.

Most data have been acquired using a specially de-
signed air-core resistive magnet (100 mm bore diameter,

which conveniently permits installation on an optical ta-
ble, this magnet provides a fair homogeneity. The com-
puted relative inhomogeneity is <10−3 over a 5 cm long
cylindrical volume 1 cm in diameter (typical volume probed
by the light beams in spectroscopy measurements), and
10−3 over the total cell volume. This usually induces

low enough magnetic relaxation of nuclear polarisation in
OP experiments. The ﬁeld-to-current ratio was calibrated
using optically detected NMR resonance of 3He. Experi-
ments for B up to 0.12 T were performed with this coil.
Several saturated absorption experiments have been re-
peated and extended up to 0.22 T using a standard elec-
tromagnet in the Institute of Physics in Cracow.

The laser source is a 50 mW laser diode (model 6702-
H1 formerly manufactured by Spectra Diode Laborato-
ries). Its output is collimated into a quasi-parallel beam
(typically 2
6 mm in size) using an anti-reﬂection coated
lens (f =8 mm). A wedge-shaped plate is used to split
the beam into a main pump beam (92% of the total in-
tensity), a reference beam sent through a confocal Fabry
Perot interferometer, and a probe beam (ﬁgure 12). A
small aperture limiting the probe beam diameter is used to
only probe atoms lying in the central region of the pump
beam. A small angle is set between the counterpropagating
beams. This angle and suﬃcient optical isolation from the
interferometer are required to avoid any feedback of light
onto the laser diode, so that the emitted laser frequency
only depends on internal parameters of the laser. The po-
larisations of pump and probe beams are adjusted using
combinations of polarising cubes, 1/2-wave, 1/4-wave re-
tarding plates. For all the measurements of the present
work, the same polarisation was used for pump and probe
beams. However valuable information on collisional pro-
cesses can be obtained using diﬀerent polarisation and/or
diﬀerent frequencies for the two beams.

The probe beam absorption is measured using a modu-
lation technique. The RF discharge intensity is modulated
100Hz) for the density of
at a low enough frequency (fRF ∼
the absorbing atoms 23S to synchronously vary. The sig-
nal from the photodiode monitoring the transmitted probe
beam is analysed using a lock-in ampliﬁer. The amplitude
of the probe modulation thus measured, and the average
value of the transmitted probe intensity are both sampled
(at 20 Hz), digitised, and stored. Absorption spectra are
obtained from the ratios of the probe modulation by the
probe average intensity. This procedure strongly reduces
eﬀects of laser intensity changes and of optical thickness
of the gas on the measured absorptions [22].

With its DBR (Distributed Bragg Reﬂector) technol-
ogy, this laser diode combines a good monochromaticity
and easy frequency tuning. It could be further narrowed
and stabilised using external selective elements, and thus
used for high-resolution spectroscopy of the 1083 nm line
of helium [43]. Here we have simply used a free running
diode, with a linewidth dominated by the Schalow-Townes
broadening factor of order 2-3 MHz FWHM [55]. The laser
frequency depends on temperature and current with typi-

cal sensitivities 20 GHz/K and 0.5 GHz/mA respectively.
To reduce temperature drifts, the diode is enclosed in a
temperature regulated 1-dm3 shield. Using a custom made
diode temperature and current controller, we obtain an
overall temperature stability better than a mK, and a cur-
rent stability of order a µA. Frequency drifts over several
minutes and low frequency jitter to are thus limited to
10 MHz at most.

The laser frequency is adjusted, locked or swept by
temperature control using the on-chip Peltier cell and tem-
perature sensor. The small deviation from linearity of the
frequency response was systematically measured during
the frequency sweeps by recording the peaks transmitted
by the 150 MHz FSR interferometer. Figure 13 displays
an example such a measurement: frequency oﬀset for a
control voltage V is 52.5
(1+0.048V )V GHz. The lin-
ear term in this conversion factor is usually taken from
more accurate zero-ﬁeld line splitting measurements (see
below), but this small non-linear correction is used to im-
prove the determination of frequency scales for extended
sweeps.

3.1.2 Zero-ﬁeld measurements

Results presented in this section have in fact been ob-
tained in the earth ﬁeld in which Zeeman energy changes
are of order 1 MHz or less and thus too small to aﬀect the
results given the accuracy of our measurements. A small
permanent magnet is placed near the cell to strongly re-
duce the ﬁeld homogeneity and thus prevent any nuclear
polarisation to build up when the pump beam is absorbed.

curately known value 3AS/2=6.7397 GHz of the C8-C9
splitting. The saturated absorption spectrum (solid line in
ﬁgure 14a) combines the usual broad absorption lines and
several narrow dips. The dips reveal a reduced absorption
of the probe by atoms interacting with the pump beam.
These are atoms with negligible velocity along the beam
direction (Doppler-free resonances) or atoms with a veloc-
ity such that the Doppler shift is just half of the splitting of
two transitions from or to a common level (crossover reso-
nances). An absorption signal recorded without the pump
beam (dotted line in ﬁgure 14a) only shows the broad fea-
tures, which can be ﬁt by a Doppler Gaussian proﬁle for
isolated lines (e.g. C8 or C9). It is used to obtain the nar-
row resonances in ﬁgure 14b by signal substraction. The
width δ of the narrow resonances is 50 MHz FWHM in
the conditions of ﬁgure 14. It can be attributed to several

combined broadening processes, including pump satura-
tion eﬀects and signal acquisition ﬁltering.

Broader line features, the “pedestals” on which nar-
row resonances stand, result from the combined eﬀects of
collisions in the gas. Fully elastic velocity changing col-
lisions tend to impose the same population distribution
in all velocity classes, and thus to identically decrease
the probe absorption over the whole velocity proﬁle. In
contrast, ME collisions involving a 3He atom in a gas
where the nuclear polarisation is M =0 induce a net loss
of angular momentum3 (a uniform population distribu-
tion tends to be imposed by the inﬁnite spin tempera-
ture, see section 2.2.3). In steady-state, the un-pumped
velocity classes will thus acquire only part of the popula-
tion changes imposed in the pumped velocity class. The
relative amplitude of the resulting broad pedestal results
from the competition of collisional transfer and collisional
loss of orientation. One consequence is that it is almost
pressure-independent, as was experimentally checked. An-
other consequence is that it strongly depends on 4He con-
centration in isotopic mixtures, as illustrated in ﬁgure 15.

sions: only 25% of the exchange collisions occur in this
case with a depolarised 3He atom and thus contribute

3 The orientation is not totally lost at each ME collision since
the electronic part of the angular momentum is conserved, and
recoupled after collision. ME collisions thus contribute both to
orientation transfer between velocity classes and to orientation
loss. The relative importance of these contributions depends
on the angular momentum loss, which is reduced in high ﬁeld
by hyperﬁne decoupling. A speciﬁc feature of ME collisions is
that they involve small impact parameters and large collision
energies due to a centrifugal energy barrier [18,20], and thus
usually produce large velocity changes.

to bleach the pump-induced population changes, while
all collisions induce velocity changes. In ﬁgure 15 is also
displayed the squared absorption proﬁle, which closely
matches the shape of the pedestal. This is a general fea-
ture also observed in 3He spectra, which results from the
linear response to the rather low pump power. Assum-
ing that the relative population changes scale with the
absorbed pump power, frequency detuning reduces by the
same Doppler proﬁle factor both these population changes
and the probed total population. The resulting squared
Doppler proﬁle is still Gaussian, but with reduced width
∆/√2.

From this detailed analysis of the signal shapes we in-
fer two main results. First, very little systematic frequency
shift is expected to result from the distortion of the nar-
row Doppler-free resonances by the broad line pedestals of
neighbouring transitions (no shift at all for isolated lines).
It can be estimated to be of order δ2/∆, i.e. of order 1 MHz
and thus negligible in these experiments. Second, popula-
tion changes in the whole velocity proﬁle remain limited
in pure 3He or in 3He-rich isotopic mixtures. They amount
for instance to a 7 % change for the C9 transition when the
pump beam is applied, as illustrated in ﬁgure 14 (diﬀer-
ence between dotted and solid line). They are signiﬁcantly
larger in a helium mixture, e.g 30 % for the conditions of
ﬁgure 15. These OP eﬀects on the populations would be
reduced for a reduced pump power, and the direct eﬀect
of the attenuated (
25) probe itself can be expected to be
correspondingly reduced, and hence negligible under simi-
lar conditions. However, this would be untrue in pure 4He
in which strong population relaxation is diﬃcult to im-
pose, and precise absorption or saturated absorption ex-
periments are less conveniently performed. A strong mag-
netic ﬁeld would also enhance the perturbing eﬀects of the
probe beam, as was discussed in section 2.2.4 and will be
demonstrated in section 3.2.4.

÷

A series of identical sweeps including the C1-C7 lines,
similar to that in ﬁgure 14c, was performed to check for
reproducibility. The frequency scales were determined us-
ing the C2-C6 splittings (these transitions connect the two
hyperﬁne levels of the 23S state to the same excited level,
see ﬁgure 3, and are thus separated by 6.7397 GHz just as
C8-C9). To directly probe hyperﬁne level splittings in the
23P state we consider the line separations C2-C4 and C3-
C5, which directly measure the level energy diﬀerences be-
tween the lower pairs of 23P levels (see the zero ﬁeld level
diagram in ﬁgure 2). We also consider the separation of the
crossover resonances χ2−4-χ3−5, actually computed from
diﬀerences of the four line positions, which measures an
independent energy diﬀerence between these levels. Com-
parison to the values computed using the 3-parameter hy-
perﬁne term in the Hamiltonian (section 2.1.3) is shown in
ﬁgure 16. For the two simple splittings, data scatter is
15
MHz about the average. It is smaller for the third com-
bined splitting, which involves averaging pairs of line posi-
tion measurements and thus a statistically reduced uncer-
tainty. The three averages have a 6 MHz r.m.s. diﬀerence
with the computed values, which is consistent with statis-
tical uncertainty. This analysis shows that our unsophisti-

cated spectroscopic measurements are quite accurate and
have very little systematic error in the frequency deter-
minations (at most a few MHz over several GHz). It also
justiﬁes the use of the correction term beyond the contact
interaction term in the hyperﬁne contribution (equation 6)
since our experimental errors are lower than the eﬀect of
this correction term (ﬁgure 7).

3.1.3 Field eﬀect on line positions

The most obvious eﬀect of an applied magnetic ﬁeld is
to considerably increase the number of observed narrow
lines (Doppler-free lines and intercombination lines) in the
saturated absorption recordings. For simplicity, we only
present in ﬁgure 17 selected results for the set of 3He lines
originating at low ﬁeld from C8 and C9. These are the
most eﬃcient optical transitions for OP of 3He, and thus
are of special interest. Furthermore, the analyses of tran-
sition intensity measurements described in sections 3.2.2
and 3.3 request an accurate knowledge of all line positions
for these transitions. To reduce the number of observed
lines and thus facilitate data processing, the same circu-
lar polarisation (σ+ or σ−) was used for the pump and
the probe beam, and two measurements were thus per-
formed for each ﬁeld value. For the higher ﬁeld data (iron
yoke magnet, open symbols in ﬁgure 17a) the use of an
imperfect circular polarisation made it possible to usually
observe all intense lines in each measurement. Zero ﬁeld
scans were performed between measurements to evaluate
the slow drift of the laser frequency and provide reference
measurements for the Zeeman shifts.

For the measurements in the air-core magnet (up to
0.125 T), the agreement between computed and measured
line positions ǫ/h is fair, but aﬀected by ﬂuctuating fre-
quency oﬀsets. The r.m.s. diﬀerences are quite large (50
MHz and 110 MHz for σ+ and σ− probes respectively),
but the largest contribution to these diﬀerences can be

attributed to a global frequency oﬀset from scan to scan.
Estimating the oﬀset of each scan from the average of the 3
recorded line positions, the remaining diﬀerences are sig-
niﬁcantly reduced (9 MHz r.m.s. for σ+ and σ−). The
accuracy of these line position measurements is thus com-
parable to that of the zero-ﬁeld measurements (ﬁgure 16).
For the measurements in the iron yoke electromagnet
(up to 0.25 T), a similar frequency oﬀset adjustment is
not suﬃcient to signiﬁcantly reduce the diﬀerences be-
tween measured and computed line positions (ﬁgure 17b).
For instance, they amount to 130 MHz r.m.s. for the σ+
measurements (open up triangles). Moreover, splittings
within a given scan consistently diﬀer from the computed
ones. Assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld is not exactly pro-
portional to the applied current due to the presence of a
soft iron yoke in the magnet, we use the largest measured
splitting on the C9 line (the transitions originating from
the sublevels mF =
3/2) to determine the actual value of
the magnetic ﬁeld during each scan. Solid symbols in ﬁg-
ure 17b are computed diﬀerences for these actual values
of the magnetic ﬁeld. Crosses (ﬁgures 17a and 17b) corre-
spond to fully corrected data, allowing also for frequency

±

oﬀset adjusments.The ﬁnal remaining diﬀerences (22 MHz
r.m.s.) are still larger than in the air-core magnet, yet this
agreement is suﬃcient to support our ﬁeld correction and
oﬀset adjustment procedures in view of the line intensity
measurements described in the following section.

3.2 Line intensities

3.2.1 Experimental setup

The experimental arrangement is either the one sketched
in ﬁgure 12, in which the pump beam is blocked and only a
weak probe beam (usually 0.1-1 mW/cm2) is transmitted
through the cell, or a simpliﬁed version of the setup when
no saturated absorption measurement is performed.

The magnetic ﬁeld is obtained by diﬀerent means de-
pending on its intensity. Data at moderate ﬁeld (up to
0.22 T) data have been acquired using the resistive mag-
nets described in section 3.1.1. Higher ﬁeld measurements
have been performed in the bore and fringe ﬁeld of a 1.5 T
MRI superconducting magnet [54]. With the laser source
and all the electronics remaining in a low-ﬁeld region sev-
eral meters away from the magnet bore, cells were succe-
sively placed at ﬁve locations on the magnet axis with ﬁeld
values ranging from B=6 mT to 1.5 T. The 1.5 T value
(in the bore) is accurately known from the routinely mea-
sured 1H NMR frequency (63.830 MHz, hence 1.4992 T).
The lower ﬁeld intensities, 6 mT and 0.4 T, have been mea-
sured using a Hall probe with a nominal accuracy of 1%.
The intermediate values, 0.95 T and 1.33 T, are deduced
from the measured Zeeman splittings with a similar accu-
racy of 1%. Due to the steep magnetic ﬁeld decrease near
the edge of the magnet bore, large gradients cause a sig-
niﬁcant inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption lines
in some situations discussed in section 3.2.3. For these
high ﬁeld measurements, the Fabry Perot interferometer
was not implemented and no accurate on-site check of the
laser frequency scale was performed. Instead, the usual
corrections determined during the saturated absorption
measurements (see section 3.1.1 and ﬁgure 13) are used
for the analysis of the recorded absorption spectra.

A systematic study of the eﬀect of experimental con-
ditions such as gas pressure, RF discharge intensity, and
probe beam power and intensity, has been performed both
in low ﬁeld (the earth ﬁeld) and at 0.08 T. The main char-
acteristic features of the recorded spectra have been found
to be quite insensitive to these parameters. Absorption
spectra have been analysed in detail to accurately deduce
the relative populations of diﬀerent sublevels (from the ra-
tios of line intensities) and the average atomic density of
atoms in the 23S state in the probe beam (from its absorp-
tion). A careful analysis of lineshapes and linewidths re-
veals three diﬀerent systematic eﬀects which are discussed
in the next three sections.

3.2.2 Eﬀect of imperfect 3He isotopic purity

Evidence of a systematic eﬀect on absorption proﬁles was
observed in experiments with nominally pure 3He gas. A

a Doppler width ∆=1.198 GHz, corresponding to a tem-
perature of 304 K in the gas (consistent with the ambient
temperature and the power deposition of the RF discharge
in the plasma).

±

The ratio of the line amplitudes after this correction
is closer to the ratio of computed transition intensities,
0.2% larger in this example. A series of measure-
still 3.5
ments performed in a row provides very close results, with
a scatter consistent with the quoted statistical uncertainty
of each analysis. In contrast, a measurement performed in
the same cell after several days may lead to a diﬀerent
proportion of 4He and a diﬀerent ratio of transitions in-
tensities (for instance R=0.35% and a ratio of intensities
2.9

0.1% smaller than the computed one).

±
Consequences of the presence of a small proportion of
4He on the lineshapes and intensities of recorded spec-
tra are indeed also observed in an applied magnetic ﬁeld,
as shown in ﬁgure 19 for B=0.111 T. The recorded ab-

gaussian proﬁles to the recorded lines (trace a) system-
atically provides a 1.5-2 % larger width and an unsatis-
factory ﬁt for the C9 transition (trace b, residue plot).
Moreover, the ratio of ﬁtted line strengths (areas) is 7.8%
larger than the value computed using table 9 in the Ap-
pendix (1.374 instead of 1.274). Conversely, ﬁtting on the
C8 component and assigning the expected linewidth, am-
plitude and frequency shift to the C9 component provides
the residue plot of trace c, which suggests the existence
of an additional contribution to absorption. All this is ex-
plained by the presence of traces of 4He, which are in-
dependently observed by absorption measurements on the
isolated D0 line. Indeed this small amount of 4He (isotopic
ratio R=0.2 to 0.5 %) aﬀects the absorption measurement
performed on 3He due to the intense lines which lie within
one Doppler width of the C9 line (trace d: computed ab-
sorption lines of 4He for R=0.2 %). The reduction of the
3He gas purity is attributed to the cell cleaning process,
which involves several strong discharges performed in 4He
prior to ﬁnal ﬁlling with pure 3He. Reversible permeation
of helium into the glass walls is believed to be responsi-
ble for the subsequent presence of a small (and surpris-
ingly unsteady) proportion of 4He in the gas. When the
appropriate correction is introduced to substract the con-
tribution of 4He lines from the absorption spectra, the ﬁt
by two independent gaussian proﬁles is signiﬁcantly im-
proved (trace e) and the linewidths are found to be equal

ted lines), but two signiﬁcant diﬀerences appear. First,
a small line is visible for instance in the upper graph
around ε/h=30 GHz, where no σ+ transition should be
observed. This is due to an imperfect circular polarisation
of the probe beam in the cell, resulting in part from stress-
induced circular dichroism in the cell windows (measured
to be of order 0.2%). The amount of light with the wrong
polarisation is determined for each recording, and each sig-
nal is corrected by substracting the appropriate fraction
of the signal with the other circular polarisation (0.79%
and 0.18% corrections for σ+ and σ− recordings in ﬁg-
ure 19)4. Second, the corrected signals may then tenta-
tively be ﬁt by the sum of three gaussian proﬁles centered
on the frequencies independently determined in a satu-
rated absorption experiment (see ﬁgure 17). But, as is the
case in zero ﬁeld, this procedure does not provide satisfac-
tory results for the amplitudes and linewidths of the split
C9 lines (corresponding to the transitions originating from
any of the lowest levels of the 23S state, A1 to A4, to the
highest levels of the 23P state, B17 and B18). In ﬁgure 19,
traces b display the diﬀerences between the corrected sig-
nals and the computed sums of three gaussian proﬁles
with a common linewidth and with amplitudes propor-
tional to the nominal transition probabilities in this ﬁeld.
Two global amplitudes and the linewidth (∆=1.221 GHz)
are adjusted to ﬁt the two C8 transitions, and the resulting
diﬀerences are best accounted for assuming a proportion
R=0.4% of 4He in the gas (traces c in ﬁgure 19). In order
to better reproduce the experimental recordings, the am-
plitudes of the split C9 lines are ﬁnally allowed to vary.
Fits with excellent reduced χ2 and no visible feature in
the residues are obtained and the obtained ratios of in-
tensities are given in table 1 for this typical recording .

to be much worse for the weakest line in some recordings,

from diﬃculties due to ﬁtting several overlapping lines, we
have also probed the well resolved D0 line of 4He in a gas
mixture in the 0-0.12 T ﬁeld range. Using a circularly po-
larised probe beam, the two transitions connecting levels
Y1 and Y3 to Z9 (σ+ and σ− polarisations respectively)
are split in frequency by 56 GHz/T (see section 2.1.2). The
ratio of the corresponding line intensities is computed to
be approximately given in this ﬁeld range by:

allows for a small amount of π polarisation in the probe
beam, which experimentally arises from imperfect align-
ment of the direction of the polarisation with B. In spite
of this drawback, the transverse probe beam conﬁguration
is preferred to a longitudinal one, for which polarisation
defects may directly aﬀect the ratio of line amplitudes.

The common linewidth ∆4=1.067

0.006 GHz (ﬁg-
ure 20b, corresponding to a temperature of 321 K) is found
to be independent of the ﬁeld. The ratio Aσ+/Aσ− of the
measured line amplitudes for the σ+ and σ− polarisation
components is found to increase with B as expected from
equation 44, with however a slightly lower value (
3%,

To summarise the results of this section, the diﬀer-
ence of measured line intensities in our experiments with

D

respect to the computed ones is usually small (of order
3%) after correcting for the presence of some 4He in our
±
3He cells and for the observed light polarisation imperfec-
tions. This diﬀerence does not arise from signal-to-noise
limitations and its origin is not known. This may set a
practical limit to the accuracy with which an absolute
measurement of population ratios can be made using this
experimental technique. Similar discrepancies are also ob-
served at higher ﬁelds, situations for which the additional
systematic eﬀects described in the following sections must
ﬁrst be discussed.

3.2.3 Eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld gradients

As previously mentioned (section 3.2.1), absorption ex-
periments above 0.25 T have been performed in the fringe
ﬁeld of a 1.5 T magnet. The exact ﬁeld map of this magnet
was not measured, but the ﬁeld decreases from 1.33 T to
0.95 T in only 25 cm, so that ﬁeld gradients along the axis
may exceed 15 mT/cm at some locations. In contrast, ﬁeld
variations in transverse planes are much smaller in the
vicinity of the ﬁeld axis. As a result, a negligible broad-
ening of absorption lines is induced by the ﬁeld gradient
for perpendicular probe beams (σ or π polarisation for
a linear polarisation perpendicular or parallel to B). For
probe beams propagating along the ﬁeld axis (σ polarisa-
tion for a linear polarisation, σ+ or σ− polarisation for a
circular polarisation), the range of ﬁelds δB applied to the
probed atoms is the product of the ﬁeld gradient by the
cell length. This ﬁeld spread δB induces spreads δǫij /h
of optical transition frequencies which are proportional to
δB and to the derivatives dǫij /dB. Each spread δǫij /h
thus depends on the probed transition as illustrated in
ﬁgure 21 for B=0.95 T.

The resulting absorption proﬁles are given by the con-
volution of the Doppler velocity distribution and of the fre-

quency spread functions, computed from the density dis-
tribution of metastable atoms, the ﬁeld gradient at the cell
location and the derivatives dǫij /dB. Assuming for sim-
plicity a uniform density of atoms in the 23S state, com-
puted broadened absorption proﬁles only depend on the
dimensionless ratio δǫij/h∆ of the transition frequency
spread to the Doppler width. Figures 22a and 22b display
examples of computed proﬁles (absorption as a function of
this reduced detuning). For increasing frequency spreads,

proﬁles become broader and their maximum amplitude
decreases (the area is strictly independent of δǫij/h∆).
Deviation from a true gaussian proﬁle is more clearly seen
in ﬁgure 22b as a deviation from a straight line. To test the
procedure used in the analysis of experimental data, one
may ﬁt a gaussian function to these computed proﬁles.
The apparent linewidths and amplitudes thus obtained,
∆app and Aapp, are plotted in ﬁgure 22c. For small fre-
quency spreads, ∆app and 1/Aapp are almost proportional
to δǫ2
ij. However, signiﬁcant deviations appear at large
δǫij, and the product ∆appAapp is not strictly constant
(it increases by 2 % for δǫij /h∆
3). This means that
whenever frequency spreads cannot be avoided (e.g. using
a transverse probe beam), ﬁtting procedures to Gaussian
proﬁles introduce systematic errors. Computation of line
areas would provide the true line intensities, but this pro-
cedure cannot be used to separately obtain the intensities
of ill-resolved transitions.

suggested by the residual absorption between the main lines
(non-zero signal at 50 and 55 GHz), which is 2-3 times larger
than computed. The insert is an expanded portion of the spec-
trum, in which several 3He and 4He lines overlap (the computed

mental broadening of the absorption lines also clearly appears
for this part of the spectrum.

symbols : data for a transverse probe beam. The straight lines
represent gaussian absorption proﬁles, and the values of their
slopes are used to extract the apparent linewidths ∆app. The
smallest linewidths, consistent with the 4He Doppler width, are
obtained for a transverse probe (∆4=1.13 and 1.105 GHz for
the 47 and 72 GHz lines). Larger apparent linewidths are ob-
tained for a longitudinal probe (∆app=1.27, 1.31 and 1.42 GHz
for the 47, 72 and 101 GHz lines).

nal (symbols) roughly correspond to the proﬁle computed
assuming the nominal Doppler widths ∆ and neglecting
frequency spreads (solid line). Clear amplitude diﬀerences
are however observed, in particular for the most intense
line. They can be attributed to OP eﬀects, and will be
discussed in detail in the next section (3.2.4). Moreover,
signiﬁcant linewidth diﬀerences appear, for instance on the
isolated most shifted 4He line (ﬁtted apparent linewidth
∆app=1.42 GHz, 30% larger than ∆4). Most of the other
lines actually result from the overlap of several atomic
transitions, and a straightforward gaussian ﬁt is not rele-
vant. For example, the computed total absorption around
ǫ/h=72 GHz (insert in ﬁgure 23, solid line) results from
the two 4He transitions at 66.7 and 72.1 GHz (dotted line)
and the two 3He transitions at 65.2 and 71.1 GHz.

To better analyse the eﬀect of the probe beam direc-
tion on the shape and widths of diﬀerent lines, we plot in
ﬁgure 24 the absorption data using the same method as in
ﬁgure 22b. The open symbols correspond to three of the
lines in ﬁgure 23, with a probe beam along the direction
ﬁeld, and the solid symbols to lines from a similar record-
ing with a perpendicular probe beam. Apart from the
asymmetries on the 71 GHz lines which result from the ad-
ditional 3He line on the low-frequency side of the absorp-
tion proﬁle (which is thus not retained in the analysis),
satisfactory linear ﬁts reveal gaussian-like proﬁles and pro-
vide the values of the corresponding linewidths. The ex-
periments performed with a transverse probe provide data
with the steepest slopes and hence the smallest linewidths,

while those using a longitudinal probe lead to larger ap-
parent linewidths as expected . Using the convolution re-
sults of ﬁgure 22c, the frequency spreads δǫij/h for these
lines are computed to be 1.4, 1.65 and 1.85 GHz respec-
tively. From the derivatives dǫij /dB for these transitions
(ﬁgure 21), one computes that a ﬁeld spread δB=52 mT
would produce frequency spreads of 1.08, 1.65 and 1.85
GHz, corresponding to the observed broadenings for the
72 and 101 GHz lines. The additional apparent broaden-
ing for the 47 GHz experimental line may be attributed
to OP eﬀects for this rather intense line (see the next sec-
tion 3.2.4). For the estimated value of the ﬁeld gradient
(15 mT/cm), this 52 mT ﬁeld spread would be obtained
for an eﬀective cell length of 3.5 cm. This is quite satis-
factory since the density of atoms in the metastable 23S
state vanishes at the cell walls, so that most of the probed
atoms lie within a distance shorter than the actual gap
between the end windows of our 5 cm-long cells (external
length).

To summarise the results obtained in this section, the
expected eﬀects of strong ﬁeld gradients on absorption
lines have indeed been observed. They introduce a sys-
tematic broadening and amplitude decrease of absorption
signals which can be signiﬁcant (up to 30 % changes in
our experiments), and must be considered in quantitative
analyses. For isolated lines, area measurements are not af-
fected by the transition frequency spreads. However, most
lines usually overlap in a recorded absorption spectrum
(especially in an isotopic mixture), and the quantitative
analysis of such spectra is in practice too inaccurate if the

diﬀerent linewidths are not known. It is thus important
to only use a transverse probe beam conﬁguration when-
ever accurate absorption measurements are needed and a
ﬁeld gradient is present. The same argument would also
apply to saturated absorption measurements, for which
even limited frequency spreads (e.g. of order 100 MHz)
would strongly decrease the signal amplitudes.

level (labelled a, D0 and d in ﬁgure 25, which we shall
generically call D0 transitions). For these lines, the com-
puted transition intensities and the corresponding weights

strongly modiﬁed in high ﬁeld. However, according to the
sum rules of equation 9, the average density of atoms in
the 23S state along the probe beam is deduced by integrat-
ing the absorption signal over the whole spectrum. This is
used to scale the absorption amplitudes in ﬁgure 25 and
have a meaningful comparison of line weights in table 2.
While there is a satisfactory agreement with expectations
for all line weights at B=0, the ratio of the weight of the
strong (D0, σ−) absorption line d to that of the weak (D0,
σ+) line a is substantially smaller than computed.

The measurements displayed in ﬁgure 25 have been
performed with a rather intense probe beam, so that OP
eﬀects may play a signiﬁcant role. As for all experiments
performed in low ﬁeld, we can assume that OP creates no
nuclear polarisation M for the ground state 3He atoms.
It is not possible to enforce rapid nuclear relaxation as is
done in low ﬁeld (section 3.1.2) by imposing a strong rel-
ative ﬁeld inhomogeneity at 1.5 T. However the angular
momentum deposited in the cell by the absorption of a
fraction of the probe beam could only lead to a very slow
growth rate of M for our experimental conditions5. As a
result, only a very small nuclear polarisation M can be
reached in a frequency sweep during the time spent on an
absorption line (
5 s). Negligible changes of the Zeeman
populations and hence of absorption signal intensities are
induced by this process. In contrast, the OP eﬀects in the
23S metastable state described in section 2.2.4 may have a
strong inﬂuence on the distribution of the Zeeman popu-
lations, and thus signiﬁcantly decrease the absorption (see
ﬁgure 10).

∼

To discuss and analyse in detail these OP eﬀects at
1.5 T, we show in ﬁgure 26 (symbols) parts of the exper-
imental spectra extracted from ﬁgure 25, together with
diﬀerent computed proﬁles which are discussed below. It
is important to note that in spite of the double-pass conﬁg-
uration in the cell used to enhance absorption signals, no
narrow saturated absorption dips appear in the data. This
is diﬀerent from what is observed at low ﬁeld when a coun-
terpropagating pump beam induces population changes
in a given velocity class, and when velocity changing colli-

cell (1018 for a partial pressure of 0.53 mbar) and the absorbed
1014 photons/s for
photon ﬂux from the light beam (e.g. 4
0.1 mW, corresponding to a 10 % absorption of a 1 mW probe
beam): the growth rate of M is of order 0.05 %/s. This result is
consistent with pumping rates measured for optimal OP con-
ditions at low ﬁeld [56]).

sions only partly redistribute these changes over the whole
Doppler proﬁle (see section 3.1.2 and ﬁgures 14 - 15).
We shall thus assume that in the conditions of ﬁgure 25
no correlation is introduced by the probe beam between
atomic velocity and Zeeman population changes, i.e. that
any out-of-equilibrium orientation produced by OP due to
the probe is uniformly redistributed among all atoms in
the Doppler proﬁle. The pumping time τp introduced in
equations 41 and 42 can thus be computed from the pho-
ton absorption rates deﬁned in equations 2 and 8 using an
averaging procedure similar to that of [7]. The averaging is
performed over the atomic velocity projection v along the
probe beam, which introduces the Doppler shift ωv/c for
the atomic transition angular frequencies ω=ω(4)

and it is 15 % smaller for 3He due to the larger value of
the Doppler width.

For a given laser intensity, the pumping rate is thus
expected to be proportional to the transition intensity Tij
and, for each absorption line, to decrease with increas-
ing detuning from transition frequencies of atoms at rest.
Relying on the OP model of section 2.2.4, Zeeman popu-
lations can be numerically computed as a function of the
pumping rate. The absorption signals, which are propor-
tional to the probed populations, to Tij and to the Gaus-
sian factor in equation 46, can then in principle be com-
puted using a single global scaling parameter (the number
density of atoms in the 23S state).

In our experiments, the laser intensity Ilas of the probe
beam at the cell location could not be precisely measured,
and instead was deduced from the comparison of the mea-
sured ratio of the maximum absorptions of the σ− and σ+
D0 lines, labelled d and a in ﬁgures 25 and 26, to the com-
puted ratio which would be obtained in the absence of
OP eﬀects, i.e. for y1=y3=1/3 (y3T3,9/y1T1,9=7.0 instead

For the conditions of the experiment (isotopic ratio R=3,

104 s and Ilas=7.4 W/m2 or 0.74 mW/cm2, which

is quite consistent with its independently estimated value.
For this value of Ilas, OP eﬀects are computed for all lines
as a function of the detuning from resonance, and the
resulting absorption proﬁles precisely agree with the ex-
perimental data (ﬁgure 26, solid lines, compared to the
Doppler proﬁles, dotted lines). This agreement over the
whole proﬁles is better seen in ﬁgure 27. There is a slight
systematic deviation for all lines at large detuning, where
absorption is larger than computed. This may be due to a
temperature slightly above room temperature (as is sys-
tematically observed in other experiments), and to the
diﬀerence between the true atomic (Voigt) proﬁle and
a Gaussian one. The agreement is otherwise very good
and fully supports the collisional redistribution assump-
tion used to derive equation 46. These measurements can
also be viewed as indirect checks of the variation of the
population of the pumped sublevel with the pumping rate,
such as plotted in ﬁgures 10 and 11, up to a 45 % popula-
tion reduction for y3. The inﬂuence of Ilas was indeed also

directly measured by using a linear σ polarisation instead
of a circular one, thus reducing the eﬀective pump power
by a factor 2 on isolated lines. All measured OP eﬀects
are reduced according to calculations, with for instance a
29 % maximum population reduction for y3 on the σ− D0
line.

OP eﬀects for other transitions also agree with expec-
tations. For instance, probing the population y2 with a
π polarisation (ﬁgure 27) induces relatively small OP ef-
fects in spite of a signiﬁcant transition intensity. This is
consistent with the reduced sensitivity of the Y2 state to
OP which was noticed in section 2.2.4 (ﬁgure 11). Most
3He transitions are diﬃcult to analyse due to the proxim-
ity of several overlapping lines, but the lines c and e in
ﬁgure 25 can be considered to evaluate OP eﬀects. Line
c is an isolated line probing the A5 state, so weak that
no signiﬁcant OP eﬀect is expected (a 0.2 % maximum
population reduction for a5), and observed. In contrast,
-16.1 GHz, two
line e consists of 4 lines (two with ǫ/h
-14.9 GHz), each with a transition intensity
with ǫ/h
1. Experimentally, the ratio of the maximum absorp-
∼
tions of lines e and c is 40.2, 4 % lower than expected
from transition intensities, thus suggesting a 4 % relative
decrease of the probed populations. However these transi-
tions concern 4 diﬀerent sublevels in the 23S state, this is
an average decrease for the populations in these sublevels.
Furthermore, the simple OP model of section 2.2.4 can-
not be directly applied since it assumes that a single level
is pumped. Still, if the A5 state alone was pumped with
the probe intensity used in the experiment, a computed

∼

∼

3.2 % maximum population reduction would be obtained
for a5, in reasonable agreement with the small observed
OP eﬀects.

Let us ﬁnally mention that OP eﬀects have been ob-
served to have all the expected features at lower magnetic
ﬁeld. For instance, for the same laser intensity Ilas as at
1.5 T, the maximum population reduction for y3 on the
(D0, σ−) line is 38 % at 1.3 T, 26 % at 0.95 T and 8 % at
0.4 T. The much weaker eﬀects expected for other transi-
tions could not clearly be observed, especially in the pres-
ence of strong ﬁeld gradients which also aﬀect the appar-
ent line intensities and shapes as discussed in the previous
section.

To summarise the results of this section, the computed
eﬀects of optical pumping in the 23S state have been ob-
served and quantitatively veriﬁed in some detail. This sup-
ports the validity of the assumptions made on the eﬀect
of metastability exchange collisions on the Zeeman pop-
ulations and of the simple OP model considered in sec-
tion 2.2. It also conﬁrms that orientation is fully redis-
tributed by collisions over the whole velocity proﬁle in
high ﬁeld. This can be undestood if one considers that
ME collisions usually strongly modify the velocities of the
colliding atoms, but that due to hyperﬁne decoupling lit-
tle angular momentum is transferred to the nuclear spin.
An intuitive measure of this decoupling can be deduced
from the high eﬃciency of OP processes at small pump-
ing rate: a 45 % population decrease can be obtained at
1.5 T for τe/τp=1/400, which means that relaxation of
electronic orientation typically requires 400 exchange colli-
100 collisions with an unpolarised ground state
sions (or
3He atom). One consequence is that performing saturated
absorption measurements similar to those of section 3.1
to probe 4He transitions becomes increasingly diﬃcult in
ﬁelds above 0.5-1 T, and certainly requires the presence of
a larger amount of 3He than in our experiments (an iso-
topic ratio R
1). Finally, a practical result of this study
of OP eﬀects is that the attenuation level of a probe beam
required to perform an unperturbed measurement of rel-
ative populations is well determined. It strongly depends
on the probed isotope and on the chosen transition, and
on the gas composition and pressure, but a laser intensity
Ilas typically 100 times lower (i.e. 10 µW/cm2) than the
highest one we have used must be chosen to have a 1 %
accuracy on all population measurements up to 1.5 T.

3.3 Optical measurement of nuclear polarisation

In this section we address the measurement of the nuclear
polarisation M of the ground state of 3He, such as can be
eﬃcientely prepared by performing OP of the 23S state,
both in pure 3He and in isotopic mixtures.

NMR is a valuable technique which can be used to
directly measure the nuclear magnetisation resulting from
the polarisation. It is however usually not well suited to
systematic studies of OP dynamics and eﬃciency: it has
a reduced sensitivity for a low pressure gas, it induces
polarisation losses at each measurement and thus cannot

p
s
s
24

continuously measure M , and it is aﬀected by the noise-
generating plasma discharge used for OP. In addition, it
requires a high absolute homogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld
B, and a retuning or redesign of the NMR spectrometer
at each change of the ﬁeld value.

In contrast, optical measurement techniques have a
very high sensitivity to changes in the electronic states
of the excited states of helium in the plasma, even in a
low pressure gas. The standard optical detection technique
[8,17] mentioned in the introduction, in which the circu-
lar polarisation of a chosen helium spectral line emitted
by the plasma is measured and the nuclear polarisation is
inferred is simple to implement and provides an accurate
non-destructive measurement of M . It relies on hyperﬁne
coupling to transfer angular momentum from nuclear to
electronic spins in the excited state which emits the mon-
itored spectral line. The decoupling eﬀect of an applied
magnetic ﬁeld unfortunately reduces the eﬃciency of this
angular momentum transfer, which is also sensitive to de-
polarising collisions. The usefulness of this technique is
thus restricted to low ﬁelds (.10 mT), low gas pressures
(.5 mbar) and limited 4He isotopic ratios (R .1) to avoid
a signiﬁcant sensitivity loss (
2 for each of the quoted
limits). Diﬀerent optical methods, which rely on absorp-
tion measurements on the 23S - 23P transition, have been
succesfully used to quantitatively determine the nuclear
polarisation of 3He [6,8,57,58]. It is a method of this kind,
designed to operate for arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds and for
all isotopic mixtures, which we describe and discuss in the
rest of this article.

÷

3.3.1 Principle

Optical absorption measurement methods provide infor-
mation both on the total number density of atoms in the
23S state and on the relative populations of the probed
sublevels. In usual situations, the population distribution
in the 23S state is strongly coupled by ME collisions to
that in the ground state, characterised by M . These pop-
ulations would exactly be ruled by a spin temperature
distribution (see section 2.2.3) in the absence of OP or
relaxation processes. For simplicity, we shall assume that
these additional processes have a negligible eﬀect com-
pared to that of ME. The validity of this assumption will
be discussed in the ﬁnal section 3.3.3.

When two absorption measurements directly probe two
populations of atoms in the 23S state (for instance at low
ﬁeld when the line C8 or D0 is probed with σ+ and σ− cir-
cular polarisations), the derivation of M is a straightfor-
ward procedure. When transitions simultaneously probe
several sublevels (e.g. in low ﬁeld with σ polarisation on
any line, with any polarisation on line C9, etc...), the
measurements of two independent combinations of pop-
ulations can still be used to infer the nuclear polarisation
M , but speciﬁc calculations are then required [8]. Here,
we are mostly interested in measurements at high enough
magnetic ﬁelds for the Zeeman shifts to remove all level
degeneracies (B &50 mT). It is thus very easy to selec-

tively probe a single level by an adequate choice of the
transition frequency and of the polarisation of the light.

With the spin temperature 1/β deﬁned in section 2.2.3,

the nuclear polarisation is given by:

Assuming that the two measured absorption signals, S
(cid:1)
and S′, are simply proportional to the number densities of
atoms in the probed sublevels (averaged in the volume of
the probe beam), we can relate them to the total number
density and to the relative populations. When 3He atoms
are probed, one obtains:

(50)

where only the total number density n3 and the relative
populations a and a′ of the two probed sublevels vary with
M . The M -independent coeﬃcients K and K ′ depend on
the probed transitions; they are proportional to the transi-
tion intensities and thus depend on the chosen transitions
and they vary with the magnetic ﬁeld. The ratio S′/S
only depends on the ratio of transition intensities and of
relative populations (see equation 39):

S′/S = K ′/Keβ(m

(51)

where mF and m′
F are the total angular momentum pro-
jections in the two probed states. To eliminate systematic
errors resulting from an inaccurate determination of the
ratio K ′/K, it is often convenient to also measure absorp-
tion signals, S0 and S′
0, in the unpolarised system (M =0,
0/S0 = K ′/K). The spin temperature can thus
hence S′
be directly deduced from ratios of measured absorption
signals:

eβ = (S′S0/SS′

provided that m′
= mF . The nuclear polarisation can
then be obtained using equation 49. The total number
density n3 in the 23S state can in turn be computed from
equations 39, 50 and 51. In the following we only discuss
its relative variation with M :

Similar results are indeed obtained when 4He atoms
are probed to measure two relative populations, y and y′,
among the three sublevels in the 23S state. In this case,
the angular momentum projections in equations 51 and
52 must be replaced by mS and m′

3.3.2 Examples of operation

As a demonstration of the performance of an absorption-
based optical measurement of M in non-standard condi-
tions, we report here on experimental measurements per-
formed at 0.0925 T. This ﬁeld value is high enough for

E. Courtade et al.: The 1083 nm Helium Transition in High Magnetic Field

the Zeeman splittings to be at least of the order of the
Doppler line widths, so that generic problems arising from
high-ﬁeld operation are present. The main diﬀerence with
low-ﬁeld techniques is that the two absorption measure-
ments required to record the signals S and S′ must be
performed using diﬀerent probe laser frequencies (a few
line crossings at some ﬁeld values, e.g. around 0.16 T - see
ﬁgure 17 - may be used to avoid this constraint, but this
will not be considered in the following). Before describing
experimental schemes to obtain such dual-frequency mea-
surements, we present examples of continuous frequency
scans of the probe laser in steady-state OP situations.

the absorption measurements discussed in section 3.2.2,
several systematic eﬀects actually limit the accuracy of
the measurements of relative line intensities (e.g. imper-
fect light polarisation or 3He purity). A
1.5 % devia-
tion from the computed intensity ratios is observed for
the M =0 recording in ﬁgure 19 (ﬁrst line in table 3). This
accounts for the observed scatter in the determinations of
M deduced from the ratios of signal amplitudes (“M for
S” values in table 3), and justiﬁes the use of the absorp-
tion measurements at null polarisation and of equation 52
to actually compute M (last line in table 3).

±

Replacing a continuous frequency scan by operation at
two ﬁxed frequencies requires accurate independent set-
tings of the laser frequencies to probe the centers of the
absorption lines. With a diﬀerent modulation scheme, in
which the laser frequency is modulated over a small frac-
1 kHz, a
tion of the Doppler width at a frequency fprobe ∼
phase-sensitive analysis at fprobe of the transmitted probe
intensity provides an error signal proportional to the deriva-
tive of the absorption signal. This error signal allows to
lock the laser frequency on any absorption line. A second
harmonic phase-sensitive analysis (at 2fprobe) provides a
signal proportional to the second derivative of the absorp-
tion signal. This is displayed in ﬁgure 28b for the same
conditions as those of the absorption measurement in ﬁg-
ure 28a. The four transitions appear to be better resolved,
and the amplitude variations can similarly be used to de-
duce the polarisation M . The respective advantages of the
two modulation schemes will be discussed in the next sec-
tion.

In isotopic mixtures the same transitions could still
be probed, but the overlap of the intense 4He lines pre-
cludes any reliable analysis of the C9 transition. Instead
we present recordings of absorption spectra on the D0 lines
in ﬁgure 29 for a transverse probe beam with equal weights
on σ and π polarisations. While the same laser power is

transverse probe beam. The OP is performed in the same way
as for the recordings in ﬁgure 28 but on the (σ−, D0) transition.

used for OP, a much larger nuclear polarisation (M =0.27)
is deduced from this measurement in an isotopic mixture.
This higher eﬃciency is similar to that systematically ob-
served in low ﬁeld OP experiments [56], and is related to
the more eﬃcient absorption of the pumping light by the
(σ−,D0) line.

Frequency scans over 20 GHz as displayed in ﬁgures
28 and 29 are performed in
100 s and can be used only
∼
to characterise steady-state situations. A simple method
to track the dynamics of buildup or decay of M in an OP
experiment consists in actually repeating identical exper-
iments with the probe laser frequency tuned to diﬀerent
transitions. The result of the analysis of two successively
performed absorption recordings is given in ﬁgure 30. The
probed lines in these measurements are the two most in-
tense lines in ﬁgure 28a. The recorded signals are obtained
with a standard modulation of the RF discharge excitation
and a phase-sensitive analysis at fRF of the transmitted
probe intensity. A higher nuclear polarisation is obtained
here for two reasons: the gas pressure is lower, and a ﬁbre
ampliﬁer is used to increase the pumping beam power [59].
Small changes of the number density n3 are derived
from the recordings. They result in part from a slow drift
in the RF discharge conditions, since in the analysis n3(0)
is obtained from the absorptions measured for the M =0
situations at the beginning of the recordings. This drift
accounts for the
1 % diﬀerence observed over the total
2 %)
duration of the recordings (>700 s). Another part (
of the change of n3 in ﬁgure 30 is clearly correlated to
the value of the nuclear polarisation. It is known that the
electronic orientation in the 23S state has an inﬂuence on
the rate of ionising collisions in the plasma:

Fig. 30. Nuclear polarisation M and relative changes in total
metastable density n3 deduced from successive measurements
of absorption signals by states A5 and A3 (B=0.0925 T, 3He
pressure 1.07 mbar). The OP is performed on the (σ+, C9)
transition with 150 mW of incident pumping power starting
from an unpolarised gas (this sets the initial time t=0). The
pumping beam is blocked after 180 s and M exponentially
decays back to 0 (T1=156 s).

(which would ultimately be forbidden in a fully polarised
system [60]). Such an eﬀect probably explains the system-
atically observed variations of n3 with M (here a small in-
crease). However these variations (even their sign) strongly
depend on the RF discharge intensity [8] and are thus dif-
ﬁcult to quantitatively predict. This makes the simultane-
ous measurements of M and n3 of special interest for an
accurate characterisation of OP kinetics.

3.3.3 Discussion

The frequency scans in ﬁgures 28a and 28b illustrate the
diﬀerence arising from the chosen absorption measure-
ment method: modulation of the RF discharge intensity
and detection at fRF, or modulation of the probe fre-
quency and detection at 2fprobe. The signal-to-noise ratio
of the phase-sensitive detection at fRF is observed to be
higher when both amplitudes of the modulations are op-
timally set. Detection at fRF may hence be preferred, but
this choice is not mandatory (a fair enough signal-to-noise
ratio can be obtained, e.g. in ﬁgure 29).

Whatever the chosen detection scheme, a modulation
of the probe frequency may be applied to obtain a fre-
quency error signal from a phase-sensitive detection at
fprobe. This allows to precisely adjust the probe frequency
on the center of isolated absorption lines, but is aﬀected
by the presence of any neighbouring lines (the eﬀect de-

pends on their distance and relative intensity). Whenever
ill-resolved lines are probed to deduce relative populations
of individual states, a careful analysis must be performed
and appropriate corrections must be applied to the mea-
sured signals. These corrections are usually smaller for
signals detected at 2fprobe when the distance to the near-
est line is smaller than the Doppler width ∆. Conversely,
smaller corrections are required for a detection at fRF if
this distance is larger than 1.3∆, as is the case for the C9
doublet in Figure 28 (the exact crossover distance depends
on the relative amplitude of the perturbing line). This may
seem surprising since ill-resolved lines have narrower fea-
tures with a detection at 2fprobe. However it is only the
central part of the second derivative of a Gaussian proﬁle
which appears to be narrower than the proﬁle itself. Side
lobes actually extend beyond the Doppler width, and as
a result there may be a signiﬁcant crosstalk between ap-
parently resolved lines. Indeed, the choice of a detection
scheme impacts both on the data analysis and on the ac-
curacy of the results only when measurements at two ﬁxed
frequencies are performed: for a complete frequency scan
of a set of lines, integration of signals obtained by a de-
tection at 2fprobe can be used to exactly reconstruct the
usual absorption spectra.

We have tested several methods to obtain time-resolved
results with dual-frequency operation of the probe laser.
The one used for the recordings in ﬁgure 30, which consists
in repeating once every measurement, is very simple to im-
plement but is time consuming. However, since the mea-
sured values of the atomic density n3 and n4 usually vary
very little with the polarisation, one may alternatively ne-
glect this variation and only perform one absorption mea-
surement. Using equation 53 or 54 with its left-hand site
set to 1, the spin-temperature (and hence M ) can then
be obtained from this single absorption measurement. For
the measurement of ﬁgure 30, this approximation would
have resulted in a maximum relative error of 2 % on M
and 1 % on the decay rate T1.

For situations where very accurate measurements are
required, or where the plasma conditions and hence n3
and n4 may substantially change in the course of an ex-
periment, alternating operation of the probe laser on two
frequencies can be obtained by two techniques. A temper-
ature change of the DBR diode can be used to induce the
required frequency change (see section 3.1.1), with a typ-
ical response time is of order 0.1 s. Following a frequency
change of a few GHz, the frequency is actually suﬃciently
1 s
stable to provide a meaningful absorption signal after
of dead time. This means that the period of the probe fre-
quency changes cannot be shorter that a few seconds, and
that the technique is not suitable to measure fast pump-
ing transients of the kind obtained using powerful pump-
ing lasers [61]. A change of the current in the DBR diode
can also be used to induce the required frequency change.
This is best done at a high enough frequency for the tem-
perature of the device to remain constant (>1 kHz), and
very fast OP transients can be monitored with this tech-
nique. However, the current changes also drive signiﬁcant
power changes of the probe beam. The full elimination

∼

of this eﬀect in the absorption measurements requires a
careful signal acquisition and analysis, and the absolute
accuracy of the results is somewhat reduced compared to
the previous techniques.

We ﬁnally come back to the inital assumption made in
this section, namely that relaxation and OP processes do
not aﬀect the ME-ruled distribution of populations in the
23S state, and discuss their perturbing inﬂuence on the
optical absorption measurements.

Relaxation of the spin variables in the 23S state7 would
drive the spin distribution to its true thermal (Boltzmann)
equilibrium in the applied ﬁeld in the absence of ME col-
lisions. Even for B=1.5 T and for electronic spins, this
equilibrium corresponds to a small polarisation (
1 %)
compared to M , so that the eﬀect of relaxation is to re-
duce the orientation in the probed 23S state. This leads
to under-estimating the true value of the ground state nu-
clear polarisation with absorption-based optical measure-
ments.

≤

Conversely, OP with an intense pump laser results in
an overpolarisation of the pumped 23S atoms with respect
to the spin temperature population distribution (this is
the driving process which actually transfers angular mo-
mentum to the ground state reservoir of atoms through
ME collisions). We have indeed demonstrated in section
3.2.4 that even a moderate laser intensity can induce strong
deviations from equilibrium of the population distribu-
tions in high magnetic ﬁeld. However this overpolarisation
is a local eﬀect which can simply be measured, and elim-
inated by displacing the probe beam so as not to overlap
the pump beam. Figure 30 clearly shows that blocking
the pumping beam to let the nuclear polarisation decay
does not change the measured relative populations nor the
inferred value for M .

Experimentally, the eﬀects of relaxation and OP which
we have observed at B=0.0925 T are similar to those ob-
served in low ﬁeld [8], and do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect our
optical measurement technique. This remains to be quan-
titatively assessed in higher ﬁelds and at higher pressures,
for which hyperﬁne decoupling and additional relaxation
processes might decrease the eﬃcacy of ME collisions to
impose a single spin temperature for all populations. Still,
based on our systematic study of OP eﬀects up to 1.5 T,
we believe that an absorption measurement technique can
provide reliable results, especially if one probes the atomic
states least sensitive to OP eﬀects, and thus most eﬃ-
ciently coupled to the ground state polarisation (the 3He
23S states Al

From a theoretical point of view, we have developed and
tested convenient tools to numerically obtain the eigen-

7 The main origin of this relaxation lies in the limited lifetime
of the atoms in the 23S state in the cell, due to diﬀusion to the
wall (faster at low pressure), ionising collisions (equation 55,

atoms), 3-body collisions

states of the 23S and 23P levels in 3He and 4He and ex-
plore the characteristic features of the 1083 nm transition
in an arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld. We have also extended the
quantitative treatment of ME collisions by deriving rate
equations for populations of all sublevels of the 23S state
which are valid for isotopic mixtures in an arbitrary mag-
netic ﬁeld. The use of an elementary OP model for the
case M =0 led to quantitative predictions which have been
accurately veriﬁed experimentally. A more elaborate OP
model, similar to the one introduced for pure 3He in low
ﬁeld [7], can now be developed. This work in in progress,
based on the rate equations describing the eﬀects of ME
collisions and absorption / emission of light which we have
obtained and on an adequate phenomenological treatment
of relaxation phenomena.

Experimentally, we have demonstrated that the use of
a DBR laser diode and of simple techniques based on stan-
dard or Doppler-free absorption measurement can provide
a wealth of spectroscopic information on the 1083 nm tran-
sition in helium up to high magnetic ﬁelds.

Saturated absorption experiments (or velocity-selective
OP measurements) have been performed in this work only
as a means to perform Doppler-free measurement of tran-
sition frequencies, to check for the soundness of our exper-
imental techniques. However the complex signals which we
have obtained, combining narrow lines and broad pedestals,
also provide quantitative information on collisional redis-
tribution of orientation between atoms of diﬀerent velocity
classes in the 23S state. These collisions are a key pro-
cess when OP is performed at high pumping intensity and
saturation eﬀects are important [61]. A detailed study is
currently being made using independent pump and probe
laser frequencies to fully characterise the collisional trans-
fer of orientation and the saturation eﬀects. This work will
aso provide useful guidance for designing improved laser
sources for high power OP.

A detailed study of several systematic eﬀects on ab-
sorption measurements has allowed us to assess the accu-
racy of relative population measurements in various situa-
tions. We have also demonstrated that ME collisions have
a very diﬀerent eﬃcacy for coupling populations in the
23S state to the nuclear polarisation in the ground state
depending on the value of the magnetic ﬁeld, the helium
isotope and the implied 23S state sublevel. Based on these
techniques and results, and using the optical measurement
methods described in the last section of this article, a sys-
tematic study of OP of helium in non-standard conditions
(high magnetic ﬁeld, high pressure) can now be performed.
One of the motivations of this study is the observation,
mentioned in the introduction, that higher nuclear po-
larisations may be obtained by applying a stronger ﬁeld
(0.1 T) than usual. We believe that a systematic study will
help to elucidate the nature of relaxation processes in the
plasma, and may lead to reduce their eﬀect in situations of
practical interest for applications requiring hyperpolarised
3He .

We wish to thank the C.I.E.R.M. in the Kremlin-Bicˆetre hos-
pital for hosting the experiment.

The additional term H cor

parameters D/2 and E/5 deﬁned by the Yale group [36]

singlet states into account with this simple model.

Given the total hamiltonian in the 23S state, which cou-
ples only states
of given mF = mS + mI , a
simple analytical expression of the eigenstates and of the
energies can be derived. To simplify the following expres-
sions, we introduce the reduced magnetic ﬁeld b (note that
AS < 0) and the nuclear correction ǫ:

These matrices are not fully independent. In particular,
the steady-state solutions of equations 31 and 32, given
in equations 37 and 38, are independent on the isotopic

coupling at low ﬁeld (sin2 θ+=1/3, sin2 θ−=2/3 for B=0)
is strongly reduced above 1T (sin2 θ±
0.012/B2). Our
state naming convention in most of this article (A1 to A6
by increasing energies) introduces three ﬁeld intervals due
to two level crossings. The ﬁrst crossing occurs at 0.1619
and Ah

for the state names and the corresponding populations, so
that table 12 can be used to transform the indexing, or to
determine the permutation of rows and columns required
for B >0.1619 T between the matrices provided in tables
13 to 17 and those appearing in equations 33 to 35. For

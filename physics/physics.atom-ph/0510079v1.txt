The Uehling correction to the energy levels
in a pionic atom

S. G. Karshenboim, E. Yu. Korzinin, and V. G. Ivanov

Abstract: We consider a correction to energy levels in a pionic atom induced by the Uehling
potential, i.e., by a free electron vacuum-polarization loop. The calculation is performed for
circular states (l = n − 1). The result is obtained in a closed analytic form as a function of
Zα and the pion-to-electron mass ratio. Certain asymptotics of the result are also presented.

1. Introduction

The vacuum polarization effects play an important role in precision theory of energy levels and
wave functions of atoms. While in conventional atoms such as hydrogen the effects of the self energy
of an electron dominate over the vacuum polarization, in atoms with a heavier orbiting particle (such
as a muon or pion) the vacuum polarization is responsible for the dominant QED effects.

In principle, studies of pionic and other exotic atoms involve effects of the strong interaction.
There is a direct interaction of the pion and the nucleus. Additionally, the ﬁnite-nuclear-size effects
are important. However, relations between values of various contributions depend on values of the
nuclear charge Z and of the principal and orbital quantum numbers, n and l, respectively. There are
certain situations where the vacuum polarization dominates. In a number of other cases, it produces a
correction, which is not dominant, but still important.

In this paper we focuss on study of effects of the vacuum polarization within a relativistic frame-
work. Their leading contribution to the energy levels is related to so-called Uehling potential, a correc-
tion to the Coulomb potential induced by a free electronic vacuum loop.

The non-relativistic results in muonic atoms (i.e., the results in the leading order in Zα) have been
known for a while [1] as well as various numerical relativistic calculations for the conventional atoms
(see, e.g., [2] and references therein).

A relativistic calculation of vacuum polarization effects can be performed analytically. In particular,
various effects induced by the Uehling potential were studied for the Dirac equation, i.e., for an orbiting
particle with spin 1/2, in [3, 4, 5]. The results were obtained in a closed analytic form as a function of

Zα and a mass ratio of the orbiting particle and an electron. However, the result for pionic atoms was
not derived because it was unclear how to write relativistic perturbative series for particle with zero
spin.

Here, we extend our approach onto spinless orbiting particles, such as a pion. Relativistic descrip-
tion of such a particle is signiﬁcantly different from that of an electron. A spin-1/2 particle is described
by an equation of the form

where the Hamiltonian H is a Hermitian operator and the wave function Ψi is its eigenfunction. The
correction to the energy due to a perturbation by an electrostatic potential δV is of an obvious form

In [3, 4, 5] various integrals, which could appear in calculation of such a martix element over the
Uehling potential in Coulomb bound system were studied.

The equation, that describes a pion, is Klein-Gordon-Fock equation, which for electrostatic poten-

This equation cannot be considered as a problem for eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a Hermitian

A simple perturbative series for the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation has not been known until now
and here we apply a recent result obtained in [6]. In particular, the analog of Eq. (1), convenient for
analytic calculations, is

This equation is valid for any perturbation that can be described by a certain electrostatic potential and,
in particular, for the Uehling correction.

To calculate the Uehling correction we consider the Coulomb problem as an unperturbed. Its eigen-

values and eigenfunctions are known (see, e.g., [7]):

unspeciﬁed in [7], which is sufﬁcient for our calculation, since the normalization is unimportant for
any application of Eq. 2.

Our approach can be applied for an arbitrary state. In this paper we consider only circular states

(l = n

1), in which the wave function is of the simplest form

Such states in particular include the 1s and 2p states. Some of these states are also of experimental
interest: the ground state (1s) is the easiest to create. Meantime, high-l states are easier for theoretical
interpretation because of a substantial reduction of the strong-interaction effects.

The most important difference is related to the range of values for the nuclear charge Z for which
the results, derived here for a point-like nucleus, can be applied. In principle, it is not necessary that
a correction is well deﬁned for the same range of parameters as the leading term is. For instance, in a
Dirac atom with a point-like nucleus the hyperﬁne interval (which can be considered as a perturbative

correction to the electron energy levels due to an interaction with the nuclear spin) for the 1s state is
well deﬁned for a narrower range (Zα < √3/2) than the leading term, namely, the Coulomb energy.
Nevertheless, the Uehling correction for both spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles is well deﬁned at the same
Z range as the related Coulomb term. In particular, for the 1s state of a Klein-Gordon particle the
condition is Zα < 1/2, while for a Dirac particle it is Zα < 1. For the hyperﬁne splitting and the g
factor of a Dirac particle the situation is similar — the Uehling correction is valid for the same range
of Zα as the Dirac term (for the reference to the Uehling correction in the 1s state see [3] for the Lamb
shift, [4] for the hyperﬁne splitting and [5] for the g factor of a bound electron).

Above we considered the Uehling correction to the energy of the circular states in a pionic atom
and found the general expression and its various asymptotics. The same approach can be applied for
any state. The result for low Z, where the non-relativistic effects dominate, is similar to that for a
bound Dirac particle. At higher Z the correction is different and, in particular, its has a different range
of applicability (see, e.g., Figs. 1–3). More detail will be presented elsewhere.

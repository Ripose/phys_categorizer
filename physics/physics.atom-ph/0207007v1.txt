A new state of the H+

−9 a.u. below the ﬁrst
2 molecular ion with binding energy of 1.09×10
dissociation limit is predicted, using highly accurate numerical nonrelativistic quantum calculations.
It is the ﬁrst L = 0 excited state, antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the two protons.
It manifests itself as a huge p-H scattering length of a = 750 ± 5 Bohr radii.

PACS numbers: 03.65.Nk, 03.65.Ge, 31.15.-p, 34.50.-s

The H+

2 molecular ion was one of the ﬁrst non-trivial
quantum mechanical systems treated in the early days of
Quantum Mechanics [1]. Since, its study has been con-
stantly pursued and the bound state calculations reach
nowadays a very high degree of accuracy [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
On the contrary, no results are available in the low
energy p-H scattering due in part to the diﬃculty in ap-
plying variational methods when two heavy particles are
involved and to the fact that the scattering three-body
Coulomb problem entails speciﬁc diﬃculties.

The H+

2 states can be classiﬁed according to their or-
bital angular momentum L, total parity Π and the sym-
metry properties of the spatial wave function with re-
spect to the exchange of the two protons Ppp. The so
called symmetric (or singlet) states are symmetric with
respect to this p-p permutation (Ppp = 1) and the re-
quired antisymmetry of the total three-body wave func-
tion is recovered by coupling to the total proton-proton
spin Spp = 0. The antisymmetric (or triplet) ones corre-
spond to Ppp = −1 and to Spp = 1. In atomic physics
one rather uses the alternative 1,3(S, P, D...)e,o notation,
where 1 (resp. 3) denotes singlet (resp. triplet) states, e
or o refers to the total even or odd parity and S, P, D...
stays for L = 0, 1, 2... angular momenta values.

As the involved three-body masses are quite diﬀer-
ent, the Born-Oppenheimer provides us with a simple,
although approximate, description of the system. The
basic idea is to solve the Schr¨odinger equation for a ﬁxed
distance between the two protons (the electronic motion
is “fast”) and use the resulting energy levels as a molec-
ular energy curve for the (“slow”) motion of the protons.
Although they are approximate, the molecular quantum
numbers are useful for labelling the states. The connec-
tion between them and the exact quantum numbers is
discussed in details in [7].

Two curves are correlated with the ﬁrst dissociation
threshold. That associated with the symmetric states
(the lowest energy curve) presents a deep well that sup-
ports the twenty 1Se vibrational states, as well as the
twenty 3P o states, etc. The ﬁrst excited curve associated
with antisymmetric states is mainly repulsive. However,

at large distance, there is a small Van der Waals potential
well whose depth is about 6.08 × 10−5 a.u.. Only a sin-
gle 3Se bound state with binding energy 1.56625 × 10−5
a.u. has been found up to now in this well, although the
existence of an excited state has been questionned in [3].
In this letter, we show that there actually exists an
excited 3Se bound state of H+
2 . Its binding energy turns
out to be extremely small, ≈ 1.09 × 10−9 a.u., and the
corresponding wave function has a spatial extension of
several hundred Bohr radii, a noticeable fraction of a mi-
crometer. This state – though not being easily populated
– manifests itself in a huge p-H scattering length value
a = 750 a.u. which will dominate the low energy scater-
ring cross section of proton by atomic hydrogen.

Calculations have been performed in two diﬀerent
ways. On the one hand, by solving the Faddeev equa-
tions in conﬁguration space [8], what provides the low
energy p-H scattering parameters and – by mean of the
extended eﬀective range expansion [16] – allows to deter-
mine the binding energies of near-threshold H+
2 states.
On the other hand, by using adhoc bound state methods
of [7] which provide the best existing binding energies
of the H+
2 system. Despite their radical diﬀerences, in
their formal as well as in their practical implementations,
these two approaches well agree in their bound state pre-
dictions. In both cases, we restrict to the non relativistic
dynamics and neglect spin and QED eﬀects.

We summarize in what follows the scattering and
bound state results obtained by these two methods. Elec-
tronic atomic units (me = e2 = ~ = 1) are used all along.
The 3-body (p,p,e−) Faddeev calculations are per-
formed in conﬁguration space. Three diﬀerent sets of
Jacobi coordinates are involved, deﬁned by

where (αβγ) denote cyclic permutations of (123), mα the

where H0 is the 3-particle free hamiltonian and Vα the
2-body Coulomb potential for the interacting (βγ) pair
Equations (1) provide satisfactory solutions for bound
states but are not suitable for scattering Coulomb prob-
lems. The reason is that their right hand side does not
decrease fast enough to ensure the decoupling of the Fad-
deev amplitudes in the asymptotic region and to allow
unambiguous implementation of boundary conditions. In
order to circumvent this problem, Merkuriev [11] pro-
posed to split the Coulomb potential V into two parts by
means of some arbitrary cut-oﬀ function χ

V (x) = V s(x, y) + V l(x, y)

V s(x, y) = V (x)χ(x, y)
V l(x, y) = V (x)[1 − χ(x, y)]

and to keep in the right hand side of equation (1) only
the short range V s contribution. One is then left with a
system of equivalent equations

Forms (1) and (2) realize two diﬀerent partitions of the
total three-body wave function

Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2 + Ψ3 = ¯Ψ1 + ¯Ψ2 + ¯Ψ3

This approach was found to be very eﬃcient in calculat-
ing the e+Ps and e+H cross sections [12].

dimensional splines. Some care has to be taken in ex-
tracting the scattering observables specially at zero en-
ergy, from the asymptotic solution at ﬁnite distance. The
long range polarization force – generated by the equa-
tions themselves – makes the convergence of the observ-
ables as a function of the p-H distance very slow and
requires an appropriate extrapolation procedure [9].

One of the advantages of Faddeev formalism lies in
its ability to solve bound as well as scattering states –
including coupled channels and break-up processes – on
the same foot.

For the 1Se state, we obtain a scattering length value
a = −29.3 a.u. The zero energy Faddeev amplitude has
20 nodes in y1-direction, indicating the existence of 20
1Se energy levels for H+
2 .

In the 3Se case, our calculations give a = 750 ± 5 a.u.
Its sign and the nodal structure of the Faddeev ampli-
tudes indicates that such a big value is due to the exis-
tence of a ﬁrst excited state with extremely small binding
energy. By calculating the p-H phase shifts at small en-
ergies and using the eﬀective range theory we are able to
determine its binding energy. In presence of long range
p-H polarization potential, the eﬀective range expansion
has the form [16]

k cot δ = −

+ a1k + a2k2 log k + a3k2 + o(k2)

(4)

where k is the wave vector and ai are coeﬃcients depend-
ing on the interaction.
It turns out that, in the pres-
ence of a weakly bound state with imaginary momentum
k = ik0, the a1 and a2 terms of the former expansion
become negligible and one recovers the standard form:

k cot δ = α + βk2

(5)

with α = −k0 + βk2
0. Coeﬃcients α and β are ob-
tained by ﬁtting the phase-shift and they determine the
k0 value. We found by this procedure a bound state at
B=(1.13±0.04)×10−9 below the ﬁrst dissociation limit
(H(n=1) + p). To our knowledge, this is the weakest
bond ever predicted, three times smaller than the 4He
atomic dimer [14].

V (r) = 2r exp (−r − 1) − 9/4r4. This model – based
on Pauli repulsion between two protons, overbalanced at
r ∼10 a.u. by attractive polarization forces – gives quite
similar result for the ground state (B=1.4531 × 10−5 a.u.
instead of 1.56625 × 10−5 a.u.
for the exact result
[7]) but diﬀers by more than one order of magnitude
(B=4.0566 × 10−11 a.u.) for the ﬁrst excited state. In
the zero energy scattering, both calculations diﬀer also
by more than one order of magnitude while at energies
E∼10−8, they are already in quite a good agreement.

The previously described Faddeev method clearly
shows the existence of a positive scattering length and
thus the existence of an excited bound state. After this
calculation was done, we decided to use a direct method
in order to obtain a more accurate value of the bind-
ing energy as well as a direct computation of its wave-
function. Because the three particles are bound, the
wavefunction must decrease exponentially if any of the
three inter-particles distances goes to inﬁnity. The idea is
thus to expand the full three-body wavefunction on a con-
venient discrete basis set and to numerically diagonalize
the three-body Hamiltonian in this basis set. For highly
accurate calculations of very weakly bound states, the
basis set must be chosen carefully. We use the perimet-
ric basis whose properties are discussed in details in [7].
The ﬁrst step is to isolate the angular dependance of the
three-body wavefunction, which is straightforward for S
states. One is left with a three-dimensional Schr¨odinger
equation depending on the three inter-particle distances
only. Using the perimetric coordinates

one can express the Schr¨odinger equation as a generalized
eigenvalue problem for the energy E:

x = r1 + r2 − r3,
y = r1 − r2 + r3,
z = −r1 + r2 + r3,

A|Ψi = E B |Ψi,

(6)

(7)

where the A and B operators are polynomials in the
x, y, z, ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y and ∂/∂z operators. The basis func-
tions used in the calculation are direct products of La-
guerre polynomials and exponentials along each coordi-
nate. Altogether, the matrices representing A and B in
such a basis set are real symmetric sparse banded ma-
trices, where all matrix elements are known in analytic
form and involve only simple algebraic expressions. The
generalized eigenvalue problem is then solved using the
Lanczos algorithm in order to produce few eigenvalues
in the interesting energy range (among several thousand
eigenvalues).

Whereas an accurate computation of the ground state
of the 3Se series requires only a moderately large basis

3

set (about 20000), the computation of the ﬁrst excited
state is much more diﬃcult and requires at least a basis
size of 150000 and a careful choice of the variational pa-
rameters of the basis. We used basis sizes up to 450000
and all the results discussed here are fully converged. For
the ﬁrst excited 3Se state of the H+
2 molecular ion, we
ﬁnd a total energy −0.499727840801511 a.u., whereas the
dissociation energy is −0.499727839716466 a.u., giving a
binding energy B=1.085045 × 10−9 a.u., with a global
uncertainty of the order of 10−15 a.u., limited by the
numerical precision rather than by the basis size. This
value is consistent with the one obtained by the scatter-
ing method, but more accurate.

FIG. 2: Wavefunctions (not normalized) of the 3Se
ground
(dashed line) and excited (solid thick line) states for the H+
2
molecular ion. They are compared with the corresponding
p-H zero energy wavefunction (thin line). The existence of
a bound excited state with very small binding energy is pre-
dicted by our calculations. Its wavefunction extends very far
in the internuclear distance r, with a maximum probability
density around 100 Bohr radii. It is responsible for a huge
scattering length of 750 a.u. Note the use of a logarithmic
scale on r.

We have also calculated the wavefunctions of the eigen-
states. These are full three-body wavefunctions and are
thus not easily plotted. However, the wavefunction takes
signiﬁcant values only for rather large internuclear dis-
tances (at short distance, the molecular energy curve is
repulsive): consequently, the electronic wavefunction is
essentially the ground state of the hydrogen atom at-
tached to one of the protons, independently of the inter-
nuclear distance. We checked that this simple property is
almost exactly obeyed by the three-body wavefunction.
Once this trivial part of the wavefunction is factored out,
one is left with a wavefunction depending only on the in-
ternuclear distance. It is plotted in Fig. 2 for both the
ground state and the ﬁrst excited state of the 3Se se-
ries. Because of the very large size of the excited state,
we chose to plot the wavefunction using a logarithmic
scale for the internuclear distance r. The ground state
is a nodeless wavefunction centered around r = 15 a.u.,
while the excited state extends much further; it has a

maximum at r ≈ 100 a.u. and still signiﬁcant values in
the r ∈ [1000, 2000] a.u.
range. There is an inﬂexion
point at r ≈ 215 a.u.; as expected, it is located at the
outer turning point of the Born-Oppenheimer (or Lan-
dau) potential, where the polarization potential is equal
to the binding energy. This is another indication that our
calculations are well converged. In the same ﬁgure, we
also plot the zero-energy wavefunction got from the Fad-
deev approach. At small r, it is remarkably similar to the
wavefunction of the excited state, which is not surprising
considering the very small energy diﬀerence between the
two wavefunctions. At large distance, the zero-energy
wavefunction diverges linearly with r and has a zero at
about the scattering length, 750 atomic units.

All calculations presented above have been done for
the proton/electron mass ratio 1836.152701, as recom-
manded in the 1986 CODATA [17]. Using the more re-
cent 1998 CODATA value [18] 1836.1526675 would not
change anything signiﬁcantly. Our method makes it pos-
sible to compute the energy levels for any mass ratio of
the particles. When the mass ratio is decreased, the bind-
ing energy also decreases until a critical mass ratio be-
yond which the excited bound state disappears and one
is left with a single bound state. We estimate this critial
mass ratio to be around 1781. This is rather close to the
actual value which explains why the state is so weakly
bound. The closeness of the critical mass ratio also ex-
plains why the Landau potential discussed above – al-
though it is fairly accurate – gives a completely wrong
binding energy.

The calculations presented here are performed using a
fully non relativistic dynamics with just Coulomb pair-
wise interactions taken into account. In this framework,
they are parameter free and their only input are particles
masses and charges. In view of the extreme sensibility of
the p-H results, it is necessary to quantify both relativis-
tic and strong-interactions eﬀects. Because the wavefunc-
tion is vanishingly small at short distances, see Fig. 2, the
strong-interaction eﬀects are probably negligible. As long
as the physical processes at work are considered – gou-
verned by a shallow potential well around 10 a.u. where
the motion is very slow – the nonrelativistic approxima-
tion is expected to provide very accurate results. On
the other hand, one should be careful with the spin-orbit
and spin-spin interactions. Indeed, in the triplet states,
i.e. with total two-proton spin Spp = 1, the total an-
gular momentum of the states we are studying can be
either F = 1/2 or F = 3/2 when the electronic spins
is taken into account. This hyperﬁne structure should
be very close to the F = 0 − F = 1 hyperﬁne struc-
ture of the hydrogen atom. As the latter is much larger

4

than the binding energy we have calculated for the non-
relativistic problem, it is likely that the F = 3/2 excited
state of the 3Se series lies above the dissociation limit of
the F = 1/2,3 Se series. The dissociation rate induced
by the hyperﬁne coupling is most probably very low.

A direct measurement of the p-H cross section at very
low energy seems unlikely. One can however access the
low energy p-H continuum in the ﬁnal state of the H+
2
photodissociation cross section. An experimental conﬁr-
mation of our results would be very interesting.

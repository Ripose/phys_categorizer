Abstract

We have developed a theoretical method for interpretation of photoionization experiments with

the H3 molecule. In the present study we give a detailed description of the method, which combines

multichannel quantum defect theory, the adiabatic hyperspherical approach, and the techniques of

outgoing Siegert pseudostates. The present method accounts for vibrational and rotation excita-

tions of the molecule, deals with all symmetry restrictions imposed by the geometry of the molecule,

including vibrational, rotational, electronic and nuclear spin symmetries. The method was recently

applied to treat dissociative recombination of the H+

3 ion. Since H+

3 dissociative recombination has

been a controversial problem, the present study also allows us to test the method on the process

of photoionization, which is understood better than dissociative recombination. Good agreement

with two photoionization experiments is obtained.

INTRODUCTION

The simplest polyatomic molecules, H3 and H+

3 , have been intensively studied during the

last decades. Interest in these molecules is motivated by the fact that the H+

3 ion plays an

important role in the chain of chemical reactions in interstellar space, acting as protonator

in chemical reactions with almost all atoms. In particular, dissociation recombination (DR)

of H+

3 with an electron leads via several intermediate steps to the production of water in

interstellar space. Many successful models in interstellar chemistry are based on H+
In addition, H+

spectroscopy data. The interest in the neutral H3 molecule is closely related to the problem of
H+

3 DR. But H3 also presents great interest from another point of view. Experimental studies

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] of the metastable H3 molecule and several later theoretical studies [4, 5, 6, 7]

revealed non-Born-Oppenheimer eﬀects of coupling between its electronic, vibrational, and

rotational degrees of freedom. As was shown recently [8, 9], these non-Born-Oppenheimer

eﬀects play an important role in H+

3 DR as well. The present study is devoted to a theoretical

treatment of H3 photoionization.

There are three main reasons for this study. The ﬁrst one is to explore a new theo-

retical method for the treatment of polyatomic photoionization. Our method is based on

multi-channel quantum defect theory (MQDT) [10, 11, 12, 13], the adiabatic hyperspherical

approach to vibrational dynamics of three nuclei, the formalism of outgoing wave Siegert

states [14, 15, 16], and inclusion of a non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling—Jahn-Teller eﬀect.

The second reason is related to a recent study of H+

3 DR [8, 9], where the reported method

was very successful in treatment of H+

3 DR, giving good agreement between theoretical

calculations and experimental results from storage rings [17, 18, 19]. However, since that

method is new, it is desirable to test it in greater detail. An application to the interpretation

of H3 photoionization experiments [4, 5] is such a test. These photoionization experiments

were successfully interpreted in previous theoretical work [4, 5, 6, 7], where another method

based on MQDT was applied. Thus, the present treatment can also be tested against the

previous theoretical studies.

Our treatment of photoionization is similar to the one developed by Stephens and Greene

[6, 7], and employed in Refs. [5, 6, 7] for interpretation of two photoionization experiments

2

by Bordas et al. [4] and by Mistr´ık et al. [5]. Both experiments were interpreted using a

full rovibronic frame transformation [6, 7]. The present treatment has several diﬀerences

from the one proposed by Stephens and Greene. The ﬁrst diﬀerence is the use of the

adiabatic hyperspherical approximation [20, 21, 22] for the representation of vibrational

wave functions. Stephens and Greene used the exact three-dimensional vibrational wave

functions. The second diﬀerence is the correction of the incompatibility between the form

for the reaction matrices used in Refs.

[5, 6, 7, 23] and the quantum defect parameters

of Jahn-Teller coupling used in the mentioned studies.

In fact, the values of Jahn-Teller

quantum defect parameters used in Refs.

[5, 6, 7, 23] are compatible with an alternative

form of the reaction matrix, which was adopted in Refs.

[24, 25, 26]. In the present work

we use the same form of K-matrix as in Refs. [5, 6, 7, 23] and quantum defect parameters

from Ref.

[5]. Thus, Jahn-Teller parameters δ and λ from [5] should be multiplied by

π

−

to be used in the present study. The third diﬀerence is in the symmetrization of the total
rovibrational wave functions of the H+

[5, 6, 7] the symmetrization is made

3 ion. In Refs.

according to the procedure proposed by Spirko and Jensen [27]: Rotational and vibrational

parts of the total wave function are symmetrized separately and in two-step procedure. In

the present treatment we symmetrize the total wave function only once at the very ﬁnal

step. This greatly simpliﬁes the construction of wave functions of a required symmetry.

The fourth diﬀerence is in calculation of dipole transition moments. Calculating the dipole

moment into a ﬁnal state, Stephens and Greene accounted only for the diagonal component

of the ﬁnal state wave function. Our treatment accounts for all non-diagonal wave function

components contributing to the dipole transition element.

The article is organized as follows. Section II describes construction of the total wave

function of H+

3 and compares our method of the construction with the method proposed in

Ref. [27]. In Sec. III, we build up the scattering matrix that represents the collision between

an electron and an ion. Section IV presents a derivation of dipole transition moments and

oscillator strengths for H3. We discuss results of our calculation and compare those results

with experimental data in Sec. V. Section VI states our conclusions.

Atomic units are used in the article unless otherwise stated.

II. SYMMETRY OF THE TOTAL WAVE FUNCTION OF H+
3

In this study we consider only p-wave scattering (or half-scattering) of the electron from

the molecule. As demonstrated in Refs.

[5, 7], higher electronic partial waves make much

smaller contribution than the p-wave to the photoionization spectrum. Similar to our study
of H+

3 dissociative recombination, we chose the molecular axis Z along the main symmetry

axis of the molecule. Directions of two other axes, X and Y , are shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. [9].

A. Total wave function

The total wave function Φn.sym

t

of the ion can be represented as a sum of terms, each of

which is product of three factors [9]:

Φn.sym
t

= ΦI

gI RN +K +m+(α, β, γ)Φv(

).

(1)

In the above equation, α, β, and γ are three Euler angles deﬁning the orientation of the

molecular ﬁxed axis with respect to the space ﬁxed coordinates system. Below, we describe

brieﬂy the construction of all three factors in the product of Eq.

(1). A more detailed

description is given in Ref. [9].

The rotational part
R
top wave function for H+
3 , which is proportional to the Wigner function [28]. The quantum
numbers N +, K +, and m+ refer to the total angular momentum N + and its projections on

(α, β, γ) of the total wave function in Eq. (1) is the symmetric

the molecular Z-axis, K +, and the laboratory z-axis, m+. The transformation properties of

the symmetric top wave function under the D3h group, are given in Table II of Ref. [9].

The vibrational symmetry of H+

3 and H3 is described by the group C3v. C3v is a subgroup

of D3h: D3h = σh ⊗
of three nuclei. For our discussion of the vibrational symmetry of H+

C3v, where σh is the operation of reﬂection with respect to the plane

3 , it is convenient to

use normal coordinates Q1, Qx, and Qy (for deﬁnitions, see, for example, Ref.

[5]). Q1

describes the symmetric stretch mode. The motion along this coordinate is characterized

by the (approximate) quantum number v1 and by the corresponding frequency ω1. Normal

coordinates Qx and Qy correspond to two vibrational modes having the same frequency of

oscillations ω2. Vibrations along Qx and Qy are characterized by the approximate numbers

vx and vy, correspondingly. The total vibrational energy can be approximated E = ω1(v1 +

1/2)+ω2(vx+vy +1). (The vibrational quantum numbers v1, vx and vy and the corresponding

4

energy E are not exact as long as the ionic molecular potential is not exactly harmonic.) Due

to the degeneracy of the Qx and Qy modes, the two-dimensional vibrational motion along

the Qx and Qy coordinates can be equivalently represented in polar vibrational coordinates

ρ and φ. Then, instead of quantum numbers vx and vy, it is convenient to deﬁne v2 = vx + vy

and l2, where l2 is associated with the motion along φ coordinate: vibrational angular motion

around the symmetry axis. Thus, the vibrational energy is determined only by the quantum

numbers v1 and v2: E = ω1(v1 + 1/2) + ω2(v2 + 1). The number v2 shows how many

vibrational quanta are in the asymmetric mode. The number l2 determines how many of the

asymmetric quanta v2 contribute to the vibrational angular momentum,

v2 ≤
−

l2 ≤

v2 . In

reality, due to the anharmonicity of potentials, the vibrational energy of states with same v1
= 3˜k
and v2 but diﬀerent l2 are slightly diﬀerent. However, pairs of states with
(here and below, ˜k is any integer number), are strictly degenerate. This is a consequence

l2, where l2 6

vibrational wave functions,

of the ion are speciﬁed by the triad of quantum numbers v1, vl2

to distinguish the two symmetries using the number l2, we will label states A1 with positive
= 3˜k having both
l2, l2 = 3˜k, ˜k
0 and A2 states with negative l2. A pair of states with l2 6
signs of l2 constitutes the degenerate pair of functions, that transform according to the E
representation. In contrast to the numbers v1, vl2

2 , the classiﬁcations with symmetry labels

A1, A2, or E are exact.

In the present treatment the relative phase of degenerate states

slightly diﬀerent from the one used in Ref. [29]. Transformations of

choice of phases are summarized in Table III of Ref. [9].

The third factor of the total ionic wave function is the nuclear spin wave function. The

nuclear spin states are classiﬁed according to the total spin I = 3/2 or I = 1/2. These

states are constructed as described in Ref.

[9]. The result is ΦI

and ΦI

The transformation of the total wave function Φn.sym

is determined by the quantum

numbers K +, l2, and gI . The ﬁnal step in the construction of the total wave function is an
appropriate symmetrization of Φn.sym

. Since the total wave function should be antisymmetric

(cid:17)

In the above equation s2 = 1 for all vibrational states excluding A2, for which s2 =

1;
1, and l2 = l′2 if l2 = 3˜k. The condition for antisymmetry with respect
to (12) is speciﬁed explicitly. If the symmetrization is trivial, i.e. both terms in Eq. (3) are

l′2 if l2 = 3˜k

l2 =

±

−

identical, then the wave function is

Φt = Φn.sym

t

(K +, l2, gI).

It is only possible if gI = 0, K + = 0 and l2 = l′2.

The fermionic nature of nuclei also requires that the wave function Φt should be anti-

symmetric with respect to operations of (13) and (23). It is only possible if Φt transforms

according to the A′2 or A′′2 representations of the D3h(M) group. This condition can be
written as ˜G = 3˜k, where ˜G = K + + l2 + gI. The determination of the total symme-

l2 =

try has one exception from the above rule. Namely, when the symmetrization is trivial:
l′2, K + = 0. For this case, the rovibrational part of the product (4) has A1 or A2
symmetry, thus, gI can only be 0. Finally, the overall parity of the total state, which is

−

determined as transformational under the operation of total inversion E∗, is determined by

the number K +: The parity is even if K + is even and the parity is odd if K + is odd.

In this study we are primarily interested in the ortho-modiﬁcation of the H3 molecule of

A′2 symmetry. Thus, Eq. (3) is reduced to

Φt =

Only states with ˜G = K + + l2 = 3˜k and with even K + are allowed. Again there is an
exception, when the symmetrization is trivial: When K + = 0 and N + is even (rotational
symmetry is A′1), l2 = 3˜k can only be negative (A2 vibrational symmetry); when K + = 0
and N + is odd, l2 = 3˜k must be positive or zero.

B. H+

3 vibrational dynamics in an adiabatic hyperspherical approach

As in our study of H+

3 dissociative recombination [8, 9, 23], we employ the adiabatic

hyperspherical approach to describe the vibrational dynamics of H+

3 and H3 in three di-

mensions. In this approach, three hyperspherical coordinates, the hyper-radius R and two

hyperangles θ, ϕ, represent three vibrational degrees of freedom [9, 20, 21, 22].

In our

calculations we use accurate potential surfaces of H+

3 from Refs. [31, 32].

The hyperspherical coordinates used are symmetry-adapted coordinates: Each operation

of the C3v group–a permutation of instantaneous positions of the three nuclei–is described

with an appropriate change in the hyperangle ϕ only. With this respect, the hyperspherical

coordinates are similar to the normal coordinates of H+

3 [5, 7, 9], where all operations from

C3v involve the polar angle φ uniquely. For example, the eﬀect of the (123) operation is a

cyclic permutation of the three internuclear distances. In the hyperspherical coordinates, it is

realized by adding the angle 2π/3 to ϕ as determined in Eqs. (23) of Ref. [9]. The operation

(12) exchanges the internuclear distances r2 and r3. Equations (23) of Ref.

[9] show that

this operation corresponds to a mirror reﬂection about the axis ϕ(12) = [

π/2, π/2]. Only

−

the angle ϕ is changed, into ϕ′ = (12)ϕ = π

ϕ. This operation is exhibited in Fig. 1: The

−
operation (12) exchanges nuclei 1 and 2, transforming the triangle Ta into Tb. The ﬁgure

also shows all three symmetry axes, corresponding to three binary permutations (12), (23),

and (13). These symmetry properties of the hyperspherical vibrational coordinates simplify

our treatment appreciably.

In the adiabatic hyperspherical method we ﬁrst solve the vibrational Schr¨odinger equa-

tion at a ﬁxed hyper-radius R [9], obtaining a set of energies Ui and corresponding eigen-

functions Φi(θ, ϕ). Changing R, we obtain a set of adiabatic potential curves Ui(R) and

adiabatic hyperspherical eigenstates Φi(θ, ϕ; R). As mentioned above, each element from

the C3v symmetry group is represented by a corresponding transformation involving only

the hyperangle ϕ. The hyper-radius is not involved in the C3v operations. Thus, the vi-

brational hyperspherical states Φi(θ, ϕ; R) and curves Ui(R) can be classiﬁed according to

irreducible representations of the group C3v. Namely, each state Φi(θ, ϕ; R) and correspond-

ing curve Ui(R) can be labeled by either the A1, A2, or E irreducible representation. The

representation E is two-dimensional. Thus, two degenerate E-components Φi(θ, ϕ) will be

labeled by Ea and Eb. Their linear combinations are also good vibrational eigenstates.

7

Several low ionic hyperspherical curves U +

i (R) are shown in Fig. 2. We specify the
2 of quantum numbers for ﬁrst several states. As in the familiar Born-Oppenheimer

pair vl2

approximation for diatomic molecules, curves of the same symmetry do not cross, whereas

curves of diﬀerent symmetries may cross. One can see from Fig. 2 that low-lying potential

curves with the same v2 are almost degenerate. This is because the anharmonicity is quite
small for low states. However, at v2 = 4 the potential curves with quantum numbers vl2
2 = 44
and vl2

2 = 40,2 are already signiﬁcantly separated.

Similar to Ref. [9], from real-valued E-states obtained after a diagonalization at ﬁxed R,

in the space of the two hyperangles θ and ϕ, we construct “helicity” [38] E states:

Inclusion of Siegert states into the treatment allows us to represent the dissociation of

the neutral H3 formed during the collision between H+

3 and the incident e−.

C. Comparison with an alternative symmetrization procedure

An alternative procedure for the symmetrization of the total wave function was proposed

by Spirko et al.

[27]. Spirko et al. describe how rovibrational wave functions of diﬀerent

8

D3h representations, Γ = Aζ

b , are obtained from the products of rotational
and vibrational parts. We use the symbol ζ to specify the parity of a state, where ζ =′ or

a, and Eζ

1, Aζ

2, Eζ

ζ =′′. (In Ref. [27], the symbol
was used for this purpose.) In the approach of Ref. [27],
†
the rotational states with Γ = Aζ
1, Aζ

a, or Eζ
2, Eζ
(Eqs. (59)-(61) of Ref.

b are obtained by combining the symmetric
[27]). Then products of rotational and

top states

N +, K +, m+

|

i

vibrational states are constructed. At the next step, these products are symmetrized again

to give rovibrational states of good symmetry. This ﬁnal step is quite laborious since one has

to consider all possible combinations of diﬀerent rotational and vibrational states (Eqs. (62)-

(77) of Ref.

[27]). To properly include all states of diﬀerent nuclear spin symmetries, one

would have to construct nuclear spin states and then use a similar symmetrization procedure

(Eqs. (62)-(77) of Ref.

[27]) one more time. In implementing the procedure of Spirko et

al.

for construction of the e−+H+

3 scattering matrix, we have found that it is diﬃcult

to obtain all states of the right symmetry. When carried out incorrectly, our scattering

matrix displayed non-zero matrix elements between states of diﬀerent symmetries, which

of cause signals an error. For this reason, we think that our symmetrization procedure is

advantageous for the present study, where we typically include and symmetrize hundreds

of states. Our procedure involves only two simple steps and can be easily automated on a

computer. First, the products of rotational, vibrational, and nuclear spin non-symmetrized
states are constructed. For each product, the number ˜G [or the total symmetry for the

states that are trivially symmetrized, such as Eq. (6)] is determined. It describes behavior

of the product under the symmetry operations (12) and (123). Then the symmetrization

procedure (if it is not trivial) is accomplished by a single equation [see Eq. (3)].

To facilitate the comparison with the procedure, proposed by Spirko et al. [27], we intro-

duce a “helicity” pair of degenerate E states, which transform in a uniform way, irrespective

of their nature: rotational, vibrational, or nuclear spin. We determine two degenerate states

III. THE SCATTERING MATRIX FOR EN ELECTRON COLLIDING WITH H+
3

A. Short-range scattering matrix of H+

3 + e− in presence of Siegert vibrational

pseudostates

Once vibrational Siegert pseudostates are calculated, the scattering matrix, describing the

collision of the electron with the vibrating H+

3 ion, can be constructed. A vibrational frame

transformation [33] can be used to calculate the amplitude Si,i′ for the scattering from one

vibrational state i′ to another i. Here, the indices i and i′ enumerate vibrational states and

states of diﬀerent projections Λ of the electron angular momentum. The vibrational part of

the indices is represented by the triad

: The pair vl2

2 represents one hyperspherical

{

curve U +

i (R); the index v1 enumerates the Siegert pseudostates lying within that curve.

Therefore the amplitude Si,i′ for the process

hyper-radius Rf , Dv2,l2 = U +

v2,l2(Rf ).

Due to the presence of Siegert states with complex eigenenergies, this electron-ion scat-

tering matrix is not unitary. The non-unitarity accounts for the fact that the electron can

become stuck in the ion, leading to the dissociation of the system into neutral products.

B. Rotational frame transformation and the ﬁnal short-range scattering matrix

The electron-ion scattering matrix Si,i′, constructed above, does not account for the

possibility of rotational excitation of the ion. If the H+
(N +′

3 ion is initially in one rotational state
), a collision with the electron can scatter the rotational state into (N +, K +).

describes a transition from one

(N +, K +). In indices i

and i′, we do not specify quantum numbers that are conserved during the collision. These
quantum numbers are the total energy E, the total nuclear spin I of H+

3 , the total angular

momentum of the system N and its projection m on the laboratory z-axis. (see Eq. (26)

below) and, ﬁnally the total symmetry of the system: A′2 or A′′2.

The change in the rotational excitation (N +′

, K +′

)

(N +, K +) is taken into account

→

using the rotational frame transformation approximation [13, 33]: Such a transition occurs

mainly when the electron approaches close to the ion. Since a basis of rotational functions

exists for which the short-range rotational Hamiltonian is diagonal, the transition ampli-
tude for (N +′
the long-range quantum numbers (N +, K +) with the short-range quanta. The short-range

(N +, K +) can be described by considering the coeﬃcients that link

)

rotational states are speciﬁed by the projection Λ of the electronic angular momentum l on
the ion-ﬁxed Z-axis and by the projection K of the total angular momentum ~N = ~N + +~l of

the neutral molecule on the same Z-axis. N and l are conserved quantum numbers in both

rotational bases. (This is one approximation of our treatment, because in reality l-changing

collisions can occur with a small amplitude.) Below, we present a detailed description of the

13

rovibrational frame transformation for the e−+H+
in both regions of interaction between e− and H+
3 .

3 system and specify all quantum numbers

At large electron-ion distances, the system is described by the electronic angular momen-

tum l and its projection λ on the laboratory z-axis, by the total ionic angular momentum N,

its projection m+ on the laboratory z-axis and its projection K + on the molecular symmetry

axis Z. Correspondingly, we represent the wave function of the e−+H+
of Φn.sym

system (LS).

At short distances, the most appropriate molecular states, i.e., the states that almost
diagonalize the Hamiltonian, are speciﬁed by the projection Λ of ~l on the molecular Z

axis; by three internuclear coordinates

since these remain approximately frozen during

Q

a single collision; by the total angular momentum of the system N, including the electron

momentum; and by its projections on the molecular Z axis, K, and on the laboratory z-axis,

m. Thus, the total wave function at short distances is

−

N, l, m are not changed by the rotational, Eq.(26), nor vibrational frame transformations,

Eqs. (19 and (21)). Therefore, they are good quantum numbers at short and long distances,

within the approximation of this study.

Note that all three projections Λ, K, K + can be negative or positive. Equation (26) diﬀers,

for example, from the one in Ref. [34] where all rotational functions are symmetrized with

respect to diﬀerent signs of projections. We keep both negative and positive projections

14

explicitly in order to symmetrize products of electronic, rotational, vibrational, and nuclear

spin components of the total wave functions at the very ﬁnal step. As was mentioned above,

this simpliﬁes the symmetrization procedure.

The total short-range scattering matrix can now be constructed using the frame trans-

formation techniques: When the electron is far from the ion, the interaction Hamiltonian is

diagonal in the basis of the long-range wave functions; at short distances, short-range wave

functions almost diagonalize the Hamiltonian. The short-range Hamiltonian is not exactly

diagonal in the basis of states of Eq. (25). It has oﬀ-diagonal elements in Λ, owing to the

Jahn-Teller coupling. The following selection rules can be formulated: (i) The Hamiltonian

can only couple vibrational states of the same vibrational symmetry and the same value

of Λ, or (ii) A p-wave electron can couple the rovibrational channels according to the rule

(Λ = 1, l2 =

1)

(Λ′ =

1, l′2 = 1). These selection rules insure that the total symmetry

above equation Γ speciﬁes the total molecular symmetry Γ = A′2 or A′′2 of the considered

can be calculated separately for all possible values of these quantum numbers.

In practice, we calculate

using non-symmetrized states of the type (1) and (24). The

S

symmetrization procedure of Eq. (5) is then performed directly on the scattering matrix.

for our Siegert pseudostate representation.

Equation (27) gives the Ntot ×

matrix will be used to calculate the photoionization oscillator strengths.

IV. OSCILLATOR STRENGTHS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF H3 PHO-

TOIONIZATION EXPERIMENTS

We apply our method to describe two photoionization experiments involving the H3

molecule [4, 5] . Both experiments have previously been successfully interpreted using

multi-channel quantum defect theory [5, 6, 7]. The present approach diﬀers from previous

theoretical studies. Two main diﬀerences are (1) the adiabatic hyperspherical method em-

ployed for vibrational degrees of freedom and (2) an inclusion of the previously missed factor

(

π) in the Jahn-Teller parameters δ and λ. Below we give a detailed description of how

−
the dipole transition moments and oscillator strengths are calculated.

A. Vibrational wave function of the initial state

In the experiment by Bordas et al. [4], the spectrum of the photoionization process,

H3 3s A′2 (N ′ = 1, K ′ = 0,

000

{

) + ω1 →

}

H+

3 + e−,

was measured. Here, ω1 is the photon energy. In the second experiment by Mistr´ık et al.

[5], an similar process was investigated. Mistr´ık et al. investigated photoionization starting

from a diﬀerent initial vibrational state,

H3 3s A′2 (N ′ = 1, K ′ = 0,

100

{

) + ω2 →

}

H+

3 + e−,

where ω2 is the photon energy. In both processes indicated, the initial symmetry A′2 refers

to the total molecular symmetry. The total molecular spin is I = 3/2 in both experiments.
The total symmetry can be viewed as a direct product of the symmetry A′2 of the H+
3 ion
with N + = 1, K + = 0, I = 3/2 and the symmetry A′1 of the 3s electron. The dipole moment
operator transforms according to irreducible representation A′′1 of the D3h group, since the

dipole operator is proportional to the spherical harmonic Y1m(θ′, φ′). As a result, the ﬁnal

(28)

(29)

16

state of the electron-ion complex must have A′′2 total symmetry. Since we only consider ﬁnal
electronic states with l = 1 (the symmetry is A′′1, when the electron is at large distances

from the ion), the ﬁnal symmetry of the ion should be A′2.

As in to the previous theoretical treatments [5, 6, 7], in order to evaluate the dipole

transition moments from the initial states in Eqs. (28) and (29), we use the 3s molecular

potential surface of H3 calculated by Nager and Jungen [37], in a Coulomb approximation.

Vibrational wave functions of the

initial states were calculated using the

000

and

100

{

}

{

}

adiabatic hyperspherical approach as described above.

B. Scattering wave function of e−+H+

3 : all asymptotic channels are open

In the previous section, the scattering matrix for electron-ion collisions have been pre-

sented. However, for determination of transition dipole moments we need to know not only

the scattering matrix, but also wave functions of corresponding scattering states. Following

general quantum defect theory [10, 12], we start with a scattering wave function assuming

that the electron energy is so large that all possible entrance channels are open. We use the
[12]. The wave function ~Ψi′ having

same phase conventions for wave functions as in Ref.

out-going wave in the channel i only can be represented as a Ntot component vector, where

each component Ψii′ with i = 1,

(30)

The functions f ±i are outgoing/incoming waves in channel i. They are deﬁned in Ref. [12].
The factor Φi(ω) is a part of the total wave function; ω includes all degrees of freedom exclud-

ing the radial one, r. The wave function (30) can be considered as a complex conjugation of

(or time-reversed to) the familiar incoming wave scattering state, having an incoming wave

only in the channel i′. There are Ntot functions of the type (30) and the whole set of Ntot
wave functions with Ntot components can be considered as a Ntot ×

Ntot matrix Ψ.

C. Scattering wave function of e−+H+

3 when some channels are closed

When the energy of the system is low enough such that some asymptotic channels are

closed to ionization, the total wave function of the system must asymptotically (in the radial

17

coordinate r) vanish in the corresponding channels. Thus, the total wave function diﬀers
from the one given by Eq. (30). Let No and Nc = Ntot −
open and closed channels at a given total energy E. In this situation: (i) there are only No

No represent the numbers of

physically acceptable wave functions of the type (30) instead of Ntot; (ii) these No functions

are zero at inﬁnity in closed channels. Every acceptable wave function should have the

following asymptotic behavior [12]:

represented as a product of two factors: one factor depends strongly on energy, another

factor is weakly energy-dependent. Brieﬂy, the two sums above can be combined in one

Notice that in Eq. (43) the summation starts at j = 0 but not at j = 1 as in Eq. (42). This

is because we represent the term with j = f in (Eq. 42) as a sum of two terms in Eq. (43),

with j = 0 (corresponds to f +

j (r)δj,f ) and with j = f (corresponds to f −j (r)

necessary in order to separate energy dependent factors from energy independent ones.

The partitioning given by Eq. (43) allows us to signiﬁcantly reduce the calculation time,
because over the small range considered in this calculation, it is adequate to evaluate ˜dj only
once for all energies. However, ˜dj should be calculated at every energy point.

E. Transition dipole moment: Integration over all degrees of freedom

Calculation of Ntot dipole moments of Eq. (42) implies integration over all degrees of

freedom. In practice, the integration is accomplished in several steps. First, we integrate

over radial coordinate r, calculating geometry dependent elements m±o and mc:

In order to avoid strong energy-dependence of these elements, we do not include factors

essentially independent of the photoionization energy.

When evaluating Eq. (46), we must choose the principal quantum number n for ﬁnal

(47)

states (n is always 3 for the initial state). For a given energy E of the photo-ionizing neutral

molecule, nf is determined individually for every ﬁnal state f using ionization threshold
energy E+

f , we take a large
but ﬁnite n, typically n = 20. Such approach is justiﬁed by the fact that the overlap in

f of the channel f . If E approaches closely to the threshold E+

Eq. (46) depends weakly on nf if nf is signiﬁcantly larger than ni = 3. In principal, this

procedure can be used for each photoionization energy E. Since the typical theoretical

spectrum is calculated for typically more than 105 energy points, this makes the evaluation

of Eq. (46) at all energies E expensive. To reduce the calculation time, we have adopted

ﬁxed values of νf and, therefore, ﬁxed overlaps in Eq. (46) for several energies E. Since

mj (

Q

) in Eq.

(46) varies slowly with E, this approach provides much more rapid and

suﬃciently accurate values of the matrix elements in Eq. (46).

The next step in our evaluation of the dipole moments of Eq.

(42) is the integra-

tion over the vibrational coordinates

. The total vibrational function in the adiabatic

Q

approximation is represented as a product of hyper-radial and hyperangular components

Ψvib(

matrix moments of Eq. (46), we can calculate the desired dipole matrix elements between

initial and ﬁnal vibrational states as follows:

where mj is m±o or mc. In the same manner as for the scattering matrix, we evaluate this
integral in two steps; ﬁrst in the space of hyperangles, then in the space of the hyper-radius.

The next step is to evaluate the integration over angular coordinates in (44). To do this,

we write explicitly all quantum numbers of the ﬁnal and initial wave functions, which is
given by Eq. (24), and we write the dipole moment ˜dj as

˜dj =

It gives the dipoles moments ˜dj in terms of vibrational matrix elements of Eq. 48, which

are calculated numerically.

In applying the present treatment to the interpretation of the photoionization experi-

ments by Bordas et al. [4] and by Mistr´ık et al. [5], we consider only two diﬀerent initial

F. Final theoretical photoionization spectrum

After the matrix elements ˜dj have been obtained, the dipole transition moments df are
calculated using Eq. (42). As we mentioned before, ˜dj can be calculated once and used for all

22

photoionization energies, provided the energy range of the entire calculated photoabsorption

spectrum is not too extensive. However, the coeﬃcients ˜vjf must be recalculated at every

ﬁnal state energy of the theoretical photoionization spectrum. Having calculated the dipole

transition moments df , the total oscillator strength into the open ionization channels is then

given by [11]

G. Quantum defect parameters used in the calculation

Figures (3) and (4) shows experimental and calculated spectra for the two experiments.

The overall agreement is quite good. Below we give a more detailed discussion of the

comparison between the experiments and our calculation.

In constructing the theoretical spectrum, we have combined the spectra for N = 0 and

N = 2 according to the experimental conditions. Speciﬁcally, to compare our theoretical

results with the experiment by Bordas et al., we have summed up the separate theoretical

spectra for N = 0 and N = 2. To compare with the experiment by Mistr´ık et al. we have

accounted for a ﬁxed angle of 60o between the linear polarization vectors of two the lasers

used in the experiment. We used the prescription of Ref. [5], according to which the ﬁnal
spectrum df

dE is constructed as

,

(52)

where df0

dE and df2

dE are the spectra calculated for N = 0 and N = 2, respectively.
The energy regions accessible in the experiments have three qualitatively diﬀerent

regimes, namely the discrete, Beutler-Fano, and continuum regimes.

The Beutler-Fano regime arises at energies between two diﬀerent rotational levels asso-

ciated with the same vibrational state. For both experiments, this region occurs at ﬁnal

state energies between the [
{

v100

(N + = 1, K + = 0)] and [
{

}

v100

}

(N + = 3, K + = 0)] states

of the ion, where v1 = 0 for the experiment of Ref.

[4] and v1 = 1 for the experiment

of Ref.

[5]. Autoionization in this region usually occurs quite rapidly compared to au-

toionization in other energy ranges. Consider, for example, an electron is excited into a

Rydberg state attached to the [
{

v100

}

(N + = 3, K + = 0)] ionic level, at a total energy above

v100

(N + = 1, K + = 0)]. Since both rotational levels have the same vibrational excitation,

{
the corresponding Franck-Condon overlap between the Rydberg state and a continuum state

}

of the

v100

{

}

(N + = 1, K + = 0)] level is very favorable, which generates a large autoioniza-

tion width, as is evident in the Beutler-Fano regions of both experiments. Figure 5 shows

a detailed comparison between theory and the experiment [4] for the Beutler-Fano region,

and Fig. 6 presents a detailed comparison with the second experiment [5]. The agreement

between theory and experiment is good, which is evidence supporting the approximations

24

we have adopted in our theoretical description.

The continuum regime is situated above the corresponding Beutler-Fano energy range.

Generally, autoionization is much slower in such regions. Figure 7 compares the calculated

spectrum with the experiment of Ref. [4]. We draw attention to two broad resonances around

740 cm−

1 and 950 cm−

1. Not only do these nicely reproduce the experimental spectrum, but,

importantly, they are caused by Jahn-Teller coupling. However, in the previous experimental

and theoretical studies, these features were ignored, probably because they were construed

as noise. The present calculation suggests that these are real resonances, broadened by a

strong interaction between rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. Figure 8 compares

the present calculation with the results of Ref. [5]. In this ﬁgure we would like to note two

other features. The experimental data is rather noisy, but an inspection of the calculated

and experimental spectra suggests that the calculated resonances appearing around 3770

cm−

1 and around 3850 cm−

1 correspond to broad observed resonances. Again, the large

widths of the two resonances are caused by Jahn-Teller coupling.

The discrete regime is the energy range where autoionization of Rydberg states is ener-

getically forbidden. However, we will follow the convention proposed in Ref. [5] and will call
the region below [H+

(N + = 1, K + = 0)] as discrete too when we refer to i2 as

000

3 A′2(ion)

{

}

the initial state. This convention is justiﬁed by the fact that autoionization of such states

is slow, owing to an unfavorable Franck-Condon overlap of these states with the ground

ionic state. Figure 9 shows a comparison of experimental [5] and calculated spectra for the

discrete spectrum of the i2 initial state.

Although the overall agreement between theory and experiment is still good overall,

there are some resonances in the experimental spectrum that absent from the calculated

spectrum. Some of these missing resonances could conceivably be caused by an inﬂuence of

the d electronic wave. This possibility was demonstrated by Mistr´ık [39]. For example, an

additional resonance in the experimental spectrum around 2970 cm−

1 appears to be caused

by an ndσ Rydberg electron.

VI. CONCLUSION

In the present study, we propose an updated theoretical method for treatment of photoion-

ization in the H3 molecule. The main engine of the method, MQDT including the Jahn-Teller

25

coupling and the rovibrational frame transformation, is the same as in studies by Stephens

and Greene [6, 7]. However, we have improved beyond Refs. [5, 6, 7] in the treatment of the

symmetry issues associated with diﬀerent degrees of freedom. We have proposed a new and

more eﬃcient symmetrization procedure that accounts for the symmetries of nuclear spin as

well as the rotational and vibrational parts of the total wave function. Another improvement

is that we include into the description of H3 photoionization the possibility that the system

may break apart by dissociation in addition to ionization. To our knowledge, this is the

ﬁrst time that photodissociation has been included in its competition with photoionization

for richly resonant Rydberg spectrum of a triatomic molecule. Although in this system,

predissociation apparently does not play an important role for the overall spectra under

consideration, it must be important, at least, for some Rydberg states of H3. In fact, the

importance of the dissociation channel was recently demonstrated experimentally [40]. In a

future study, hopefully, we will investigate theoretically the predissociation of such Rydberg

states. The inclusion of predissociation could also be important in studies of other triatomic

molecules. Note that as in Ref.

[8, 9], we have corrected the earlier inconsistency in the

reaction matrix convention employed in Refs. [5, 6, 7, 23] which results in a multiplication of

the Jahn-Teller parameters λ and δ employed in those references by the factor of

π. In the

−

present study, we have also improved the dipole moment calculation, and reformulated it in

a form that should be particularly accurate for the photoionization of a Rydberg molecular

initial state. In contrast to most previous studies of H3 photoionization,[5, 6, 7] the present

treatment makes use of the adiabatic hyperspherical approach for the vibrational motion

of the nuclei in the H+

3 ion and in the H3 initial state being photoionized. Owing to the

adiabatic approximation, this approach should be a priori less accurate than the one used

in Refs.

[5, 6, 7], but the loss of accuracy due to this approximation seems to be small.

The possibility of constructing a uniﬁed theoretical description of H3 photoionization and
H+

3 dissociative recombination is an attractive feature of this approach.

We have obtained good agreement with both photoionization experiments [4, 5] and with

many of the spectra obtained in previous theoretical studies [5, 6, 7]. In some regions the

agreement with the experiments is even better in the present study than it was in Refs.

[5, 6, 7]. We attribute this to the correction of the aforementioned error in determination

of the Jahn-Teller coupling parameters λ and δ. Although we have been able to reproduce

most of the observed resonance features, both in position and in shape, there remain several

26

features in the experimental spectra that are not described by our treatment. One possible

explanation of the discrepancy between theory and experiment is the inﬂuence of nd Rydberg

states, as proposed by Mistr´ık [39], because we have not taken these states into consideration.

In conclusion, we would reiterate that we have developed a new theoretical method that

can be applied to a uniﬁed treatment of photoionization and dissociative recombination for

molecules of the D3h symmetry group. Our application to the H3 molecule shows good gen-

eral agreement with existing experimental observations of H3 photoionization. The method

has also been shown in our previous study [8, 9] to give good agreement with measurements

of H+

3 dissociative recombination.

VII. APPENDIX

Suppose the laser light is linearly polarized in the Z direction in LS. The covariant

spherical tensor components of the polarization vector are then (ǫ+1, ǫ0, ǫ

1) = (0, 1, 0). The

FIG. 1: The ﬁgure demonstrates how the two-dimensional space of the hyperangles θ and ϕ

reproduces all possible shapes of a triangle consisting of three nuclei. The size of the system is

controlled by the hyper-radius, which is not shown here. Hyperangle ϕ starts at point ϕ = 0 and

goes counter clockwise from 0 to 2π. The hyperangle θ is 0 at the symmetric conﬁguration and it

changes to θ = π/2 where it represents linear conﬁgurations. The ﬁgure also shows symmetry axes:

Every operation in the group C3v involves only the hyperangle ϕ. For example, the operation (12)

transforms the triangle Ta into the triangle Tb, which corresponds to a reﬂection around the line

ϕ = π/2 . . . 3π/2.

FIG. 2: Lowest adiabatic hyperspherical potentials of the H+

3 ion plotted as functions of hyper-

radius. Potentials of the A1 symmetry are plotted with solid lines, A2 curves are represented

with dot-dashed lines, and E curves are represented with dashed lines. Every E curve is doubly

degenerate. For several lowest curves we also specify approximate quantum numbers v2 and l2. For

excited hyperspherical states such quantum numbers can not be deﬁned since the three-dimensional

ionic potential is strongly anharmonic at large energies. As is clear in the ﬁgure the potential v144

is already strongly shifted from its partners v142 and v140 toward to the next family of states v15l2.

FIG. 3: Comparison of calculated photoionization spectra (upper and middle panel) and the

experimental (lower panel) spectrum obtained by Bordas et al. [4]. In this experiment, the initial

state of H3 is [3s2A′2,

000
{

(1, 0)]. The upper panel shows theoretical spectra calculated separately
}

for N = 0 (black line) and N = 2 (gray line). The middle panel shows the sum result of the two

spectra convolved with the experimental resolution width 0.15 cm−

1. Therefore, the spectrum in

the middle panel should be compared with the experimental spectrum. Here and in all following

ﬁgures, the energy is related to the ground rovibrational level of H+

panel) from experiment of Ref. [5]. In this experiment, the initial state diﬀers from the experiment

by Bordas et al.: It is [3s2A′2,

{

(1, 0)].
}

In constructing the theoretical spectrum, we have

combined the spectra for N = 0 and N = 2 according to experimental conditions (see text). The

ﬁnal spectrum is convolved with the experimental resolution width of 0.2 cm−

1.

000
{

N + = 1 ionic rotational levels. The series of wide resonances

are due to the fast rotational autoionization of states with N + = 3 to an open continuum of the

N + = 1 rotational level. Interlopers at 70 cm−

1 and 150 cm−

1 are two examples of resonances

playing an important role in DR of H+

resonances at 740 cm−

1 and 950 cm−

1 are produced by the Jahn-Teller coupling between electronic

and vibrational motion of H3. Although the overall agreement between theory and experiment is

better than in previous theoretical studies [4, 6, 7], several experimental features still exist that

are not reproduced in the present approach.

between theory and experiment is better than in the previous theoretical study [5], but there are

FIG. 10: The ﬁgure demonstrates a correlation between photoionization (upper panel) and dis-

sociative recombination (lower panel) spectra obtained theoretically and in the experiment. The

upper panel shows both experimental [4] and theoretical spectra, similar to Fig. 3. The lower panel

gives an experimental DR rate obtained in Ref. [17], which is shown as circles. Grey line in lower

panel gives theoretical probability of DR process, calculated for the total A′2 symmetry of H+
3 .

This symmetry corresponds to the total symmetry of H3 in the both photoionization experiments

considered in this study.

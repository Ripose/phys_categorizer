Abstract

We report observation of Bose-Einstein condensation of a trapped, dilute
gas of atomic hydrogen. The condensate and normal gas are studied by
two-photon spectroscopy of the 1S-2S transition.
Interactions among the
atoms produce a shift of the resonance frequency proportional to density.
The condensate is clearly distinguished by its large frequency shift. The peak
1015 cm−3, corresponding to a condensate
condensate density is 4.8
population of 109 atoms. The BEC transition occurs at about T = 50 µK
and n = 1.8

1014 cm−3.

The search for Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases began in 1978 [1], pre-
cipitated by the suggestion of Stwalley and Nasanow [2] that spin-polarized atomic hydrogen
should be an ideal candidate for the study of such extreme quantum behavior. Dilute gases
of H were ﬁrst stabilized by Silvera and Walraven [3]. Subsequent attempts to achieve BEC
were thwarted by recombination on the walls of the conﬁnement cell [4]. In order to create
the colder samples necessary for further progress toward BEC, our group suggested [5] and
demonstrated [6] wall-free conﬁnement and evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling made
it possible to cool alkali metal atoms below the laser cooling limit and to achieve BEC in
dilute gases of Rb [7], Na [8], and Li [9]. In this paper we report the achievement of BEC
in H and a study of the gas by high resolution spectroscopy.

Hydrogen condensates share many characteristics with condensates of alkali metal atoms,
but there are several notable diﬀerences. Owing to hydrogen’s simplicity, properties such
as interatomic potentials and spin relaxation rates are well understood theoretically. Com-
pared to those of other atoms, the s-wave scattering length, a, and three-body loss rate
are anomalously low. As a result the condensate density is high, even for small condensate
fractions, and the elastic collision rate is low, which retards evaporative cooling. Because of
hydrogen’s small mass, the BEC transition occurs at higher temperatures than previously
observed. The cryogenic trap loading technique used for H allows orders of magnitude more
atoms to be trapped, providing condensates that are much larger than yet achieved in other
systems. Finally, high resolution two-photon spectroscopy provides a new tool for studying
condensates.

The starting point for the observations reported here is described in the accompanying
paper [10]: a gas of atomic hydrogen, conﬁned in a cylindrically symmetric magnetic trap,
and cooled to 120 µK by evaporation over a magnetic ﬁeld saddlepoint at one end of the trap
[11]. Below about 120 µK this method of forcing evaporation proved to be ineﬃcient. As
explained by Surkov et al. [12], when the temperature is reduced and the atoms settle into
the harmonic region of the trap, the axial and radial motional degrees of freedom become
uncoupled. For eﬃcient evaporation, the escape time for energetic atoms must be short
compared to the collision time. However, the escape time for atoms with high radial energy
becomes very long when the motion uncouples, and thus escape is blocked for this large
class of energetic atoms. By itself this would only slow evaporation, but in the presence of
losses due to dipolar relaxation [5,6] phase space compression ceases.

To overcome this problem, we turned to a diﬀerent ejection technique, based on spin
resonance [13], ﬁrst demonstrated for the alkali metal atoms [14]. An RF ﬁeld causes tran-
sitions to an untrapped magnetic sublevel wherever the trapping magnetic ﬁeld satisﬁes the
resonance condition. Atoms with high energy in any degree of freedom are thus able to
escape, assuring high evaporation eﬃciency. As the RF frequency is decreased, the energy
threshold for ejection from the trap is lowered. To implement RF evaporation in the cryo-
genic environment, we developed a non-metallic trapping cell which allows us to apply RF
10−7 T and frequency up to 46 MHz [15]. Typically we switch
ﬁelds with strength up to 2
to RF evaporation at a trap depth of 1.1 mK, corresponding to a sample temperature of
120 µK.

×

We measure the temperature and density distribution of the gas by two-photon spec-
troscopy of the 1S-2S transition [16]. Two-photon excitation in a standing wave leads to
two types of absorption: Doppler-sensitive, due to absorption of co-propagating photons,

2

and Doppler-free, due to absorption of counter-propagating photons. In the ﬁrst case the
spectrum exhibits a recoil shift of ¯hk2/2πm = 6.7 MHz and Doppler broadening that can
be used to measure the absolute temperature. In the second case, Doppler-free excitation
results in a narrow, intense line. These features are shown in the composite spectrum, Fig. 1.
When the sample is cooled below 50 µK, additional features appear in the spectrum,
indicating the onset of BEC. The Doppler-free spectrum exhibits a new feature with a large
red-shift. As described in the accompanying paper [10], the 1S-2S transition frequency is
red-shifted by an amount proportional to the density. Thus, this new feature indicates the
formation of a region of high density, as expected for a condensate. Another new feature
also appears in the Doppler-sensitive spectrum, which probes the sample’s momentum dis-
tribution; the narrow momentum distribution of the condensate appears as an additional
feature in the middle of the wide, recoil-shifted Doppler proﬁle of the thermal cloud [17].
This feature, whose intrinsic width should be given by the uncertainty relation, is broadened
in these experiments by the high condensate density. As expected, it appears qualitatively
similar to the Doppler-free spectrum of the condensate.

The onset of BEC is further conﬁrmed by the trajectory of the normal gas as it is cooled
through phase space (see Fig. 2). The maximum density of the normal gas, n0, is determined
by measuring the shift of the Doppler-free spectrum of the normal gas [10]. As the trap depth,
ǫt, is reduced from 1.1 mK to 300 µK, the density increases because the cooled atoms settle
into the lowest energy regions of the trap. At a depth of 300 µK there is a change in the
trajectory; it begins to fall with temperature, indicating the onset of BEC. For a sample in
equilibrium below the transition temperature, the maximum density of the normal fraction
is pinned at the critical density nc(T ) = 2.612(2πmkBT )3/2/h3; excess population is in the
Bose condensate. Although it is not clear that our samples are in thermal equilibrium, this
portion of the trajectory approximates the BEC phase transition line.

The solid line in Fig. 2 indicates the critical density, nc(T ), assuming that η

ǫt/kBT =
6. The parameter η is set by a competition between cooling due to evaporation and heating
due to dipolar spin relaxation. Dipolar relaxation preferentially removes low energy atoms
from regions of highest density at the bottom of the trap. The condensate has a high
density, and thus high loss rate. The value of η is expected to change from about 9 at higher
temperatures in the absence of a condensate to about 5 in the presence of a condensate at
the lowest trap depths. The value η = 6 was measured spectroscopically at a trap depth
ǫt = 280 µK [18].

The peak condensate density extracted from Fig. 3 is the largest in this series of experi-
ments, but several other spectra gave comparable results. From this peak density we compute
the mean ﬁeld energy, the total number of condensate atoms, and the condensate fraction.
We model our trap by the Ioﬀe-Pritchard potential V (ρ, z) = q(αρ)2 + (βz2 + θ)2
θ.

The parameters α and β are calculated from the magnetic coil geometry. Because of the
sensitivity of the axial bias ﬁeld, θ, to stray ﬁelds, we measure it using an RF ejection
2 µK. For small displacements the radial
technique; for these experiments θ/kB = 35
oscillation frequency is ωρ = α/√mθ = 2π
0.11 kHz, and the axial frequency is
ωz = q2β/m = 2π
10.2 Hz. We can apply the Thomas-Fermi approximation to this sam-
ple because the peak mean ﬁeld energy np ˜U /kB = nph2a/πmkB = 1.9 µK is much greater
than the harmonic oscillator level spacing, ¯hωr/kB = 190 nK. In this approximation, the

condensate density proﬁle is n(ρ, z) = np −

Compared to alkali metal atoms, the maximum achievable equilibrium condensate frac-
tion for hydrogen is expected to be small [19]. Hydrogen’s small s-wave scattering length
dramatically reduces the elastic collision rate in the thermal cloud, and thus the evaporative
cooling rate. The high density in a condensate can drastically increase the heating due to
dipolar relaxation; the resulting heating-cooling balance limits the condensate fraction.

≡

The condensate fraction, f

Nc/(Nn+Nc), is obtained by comparing the integrated area
of the spectra of the condensate and normal gas after accounting for the partial (
10%)
∼
illumination of the normal gas by the laser beam. A condensate fraction f = 5+4
−2% is
obtained, with dominant uncertainty coming from the relative size of the laser beam and
thermal cloud. Alternatively, the condensate fraction may be estimated by comparing the
condensate population, Nc, to the calculated normal gas population, Nn, which is simply
the Bose occupation function weighted by the density of states, integrated over the trapped
states. The trap parameters α and β cancel in the ratio Nc/Nn, and the remaining param-
eters, T , np, and θ, are measured. We use the Doppler broadened spectrum to measure the
5 µK. Since this thermal energy scale is much larger than the peak
temperature at 45
mean ﬁeld energy, perturbations to the density distribution of the normal gas due to the
condensate may be neglected. The resulting fraction is f = 6+6
−3%. Both methods for de-
termining f are complicated by the possibility that the sample is not in equilibrium. Note
also that the mean collision time is comparable to the axial oscillation period, and so small
axial temperature gradients might exist.

±

The time evolution of the condensate is shown in Fig. 4. As expected, when the con-
densate decays the spectrum narrows, indicating a reduction in density, and becomes less
intense, indicating a reduction in condensate population. The lifetime is observed to be
about 5 s. The condensate decays rapidly by dipolar relaxation, but is simultaneously re-
plenished by the normal gas. The laser probe artiﬁcially shortens the lifetime by evaporating
He from optical surfaces; the streaming He knocks atoms out of the trap.

We ﬁnd that the presence of the condensate signiﬁcantly distorts the Doppler-free spec-
trum of the normal gas, even though the condensate volume is only about 10−3 of the
volume of the thermal cloud. Figure 5 shows spectra taken above and below the onset of
BEC. The spectra for samples without condensates show the shift and lineshape due to
the inhomogeneous density. The lines are roughly symmetric, and are consistent with cal-
culations assuming thermal equilibrium [20]. Below the transition, however, a pronounced
asymmetry appears, showing spectral weight at frequency shifts much larger than expected
for the maximum density in the normal gas, nc(T ). The origin of this eﬀect is not yet

4

understood.

The signal-to-noise ratio in these experiments is limited by the light collection solid angle,
10−2 ster. Improvements should allow the spectroscopic observation technique
about 2
to provide information which is complementary to that obtained by the spatial imaging
techniques used in other experiments; the Doppler-sensitive spectrum constitutes an in situ
direct measure of the momentum distribution.

×

Currently seven minutes are required to load the trap and produce a condensate. This
is limited by slow thermalization due to the anomalously small collision cross-section. As a
possible remedy, a small admixture of foreign paramagnetic atoms in the trap could act as
a thermal moderator if the collision cross-section with H is typical; the thermalization rate
and the condensate fraction should both dramatically increase.

phasizing features due to a condensate. The intense, narrow peak arises from absorption of
counter-propagating photons by the normal gas, and exhibits no ﬁrst-order Doppler broadening.
The wide, low feature on the right is from absorption of co-propagating photons. The solid line
is the recoil-shifted, Doppler-broadened, Gaussian lineshape of the normal gas corresponding to
T = 40 µK. The high density in the condensate shifts a portion of the Doppler-free line to the red.
The condensate’s narrow momentum distribution gives rise to a similar feature near the center of
the Doppler-sensitive line. Zero detuning is taken for unperturbed atoms excited Doppler-free. All
frequencies are referenced to the 243 nm excitation radiation.

FIG. 2. Density of non-condensed fraction of the gas as the trap depth is reduced along the
cooling path. The density is measured by the optical resonance shift [10], and the trap depth is
set by the RF frequency. The lines (dash, solid, dot-dash) indicate the BEC phase transition line,
assuming a sample temperature of (1/5th, 1/6th, 1/7th) the trap depth. The scatter of the data
reﬂects the reproducibility of the laser probe technique and is dominated by alignment of the laser
beam to the sample.

A note on the calculation of the eﬀective range

The closed form of the ﬁrst order non-linear diﬀerential equation that is satisﬁed by the eﬀective
range within the variable phase formulation of scattering theory is discussed.
It is shown that
the conventional method of determining the eﬀective range, by ﬁtting a numerical solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation to known asymptotic boundary conditions, can be modiﬁed to include the ﬁrst
order contribution of a long range interaction.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Scattering of atoms and molecules in an ultra-cold environment is a process that is very important in the interpreta-
tion of measurements of properties of cold trapped gases and in the study of Bose-Einstein condensation. At such low
temperatures s-wave scattering dominates and the scattering length, a, usually suﬃces to describe collisions. However
the eﬀective range, re, is important because it implies that there is a relative contribution to the elastic scattering
cross section at energy E of 2µEare where µ is the reduced mass. The eﬀective range can provide an upper bound to
the temperature, T , of a trapped sample in thermal equilibrium below which only the scattering length is signiﬁcant;
for example the corresponding relative contribution to the elastic scattering cross section that is attributable to the
eﬀective range is 2µkBT are where kB is Boltzmann’s constant. Previously [1] we used the variable phase formulation
of scattering theory [2] to study the calculation of the scattering length in the presence of long range forces. Here we
make a study of the eﬀective range.

In the conventional method of calculating the eﬀective range a numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for
scattering is ﬁtted to known asymptotic boundary conditions at some suitably large separation Rc to yield a phase
shift. This is repeated for several small values of the asymptotic wave number of the relative motion, k, and the
values of a and re are obtained from the eﬀective range theory ﬁt of the phase shift as a function of k [3]. This
procedure is appropriate even in the presence of long range forces because, by making the ﬁt at the ﬁnite separation
Rc, we solve a problem for short ranges forces curtailed at Rc. A diﬃculty occurs in that Rc must be large. Here
we present a correction that accounts for the inﬂuence of a long range force over the range [Rc, ∞[ to ﬁrst order in
the potential strength. It allows much smaller values of Rc to be used with attendant reduction in computation time
and accumulated error. Marinescu [4] has provided ﬁrst and higher order corrections but they are complicated in
comparison to our formulation and, in most cases, a ﬁrst order correction is enough.

In the notation of Levy and Keller [5] the s-wave phase shift η is expanded as

II. THEORY

η = N π + k(η0 + k2η1 + . . .)

where N is the number of bound states supported by the interaction potential. Equation (1) is in accord with
Levinson’s theorem. Levy and Keller [5] omitted the term N π from their equation (8) but the subsequent analysis is
not altered because eﬀective range theory [3] provides an expansion for k cot η.

When long range forces are present expansion (1) and the eﬀective range expansion have additional terms in k,
such as k4 ln k, but for interactions dominated by a Van der Waals R−6 dispersion potential the leading terms have
the indicated k-dependence although the coeﬃcients, ηi, are modiﬁed [6]. In variable phase theory the phase shift
and these coeﬃcients are functions of the separation, R, and hence the scattering length and the eﬀective range are
also functions of R. The eﬀective range expansion is [3]

The scattering length, a(R), is the limit as k → 0 of − tan η(R)/k and hence is −η0(R). The eﬀective range is twice
the coeﬃcient of the term in k2 in equation (2) and from the Taylor expansion of the cotangent it can be expressed as

we ﬁnd that numerical evaluation is not conveniently provided in this way because the closed form solution (8) requires
computation of a double integral and, when the interaction supports bound states, also requires a suitable numerical
account of the poles in the scattering length, a(R); these poles also make a direct numerical solution of equation (7)
impractical. The adaptive method of Lambert [7] is unsuitable for heavy particle collisions because there are many
poles in a(R). The log-derivative method that we used previously [1] is also unsuitable; although equations (6) and
(7) may be written in the Riccati form

the diﬀerence between the right hand side and the unit matrix prevents application of the log-derivative method. A
rational fraction transformation of equation (9) yields another Riccati equation [8] but there is no obvious transfor-
mation that simultaneously changes the right hand side of equation (9) to a unit matrix and maintains the structure
of its left hand side.

We suggest that the conventional method for obtaining the eﬀective range is used at separation Rc, chosen beyond
the last pole in a(R), and equations (3) and (7) are then used to obtain a correction that is of ﬁrst order in the
potential strength.

III. LONG RANGE CORRECTIONS

The exponential terms in expression (8) are positive. Hence the contribution to η1(R) from the range [Rc, ∞) is
negative when the potential is attractive over this range and therefore the conventional calculation yields an upper
bound to η1 = η1(∞).

The subsequent analysis is simpler when presented in terms of dimensionless quantities obtained by scaling by
suitable powers of Rc. Throughout the remainder of this note, unless otherwise indicated, we let R, a, re, V and η1
denote the corresponding quantities divided by Rc, Rc, Rc, R−2
c respectively. Equations (3), (6) and (7) are

diﬀerent methods [9]. Note that the correction given by equation (14) is not identical to the correction in reference [9];
equation (14) provides the correction to the eﬀective range whereas reference [9] gives the correction to the product

IV. METHOD

Our suggested procedure for calculating the eﬀective range is as follows. First evaluate the scattering length and
eﬀective range at separation Rc by the conventional method and then scale them by division by Rc. For each term
such as (12) of the long range potential, evaluate the scaled correction δre of equation (14) and ﬁnd the sum of
the corrections; this is legitimate because we are interested in only the ﬁrst order correction. Multiply the resulting
correction by Rc. Some experiment is needed to ﬁnd a suitable value for Rc but generally it is much smaller than the
separation that represents inﬁnity in the conventional method without correction. The leading terms that describe
the inﬂuence of the long range force that are not accounted for by equation (14) are of second order and hence are
proportional to (αn−2
)2. The chosen value of Rc should coerce this quantity to be smaller than unity; a suitable
choice is several times the characteristic length,

, of the potential.

V. EXAMPLE

For the model Cs-Cs potential described by Gribakin and Flambaum [10] we obtained the eﬀective range accurate
to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures with Rc = 1400 bohr while even the ﬁrst signiﬁcant ﬁgure is uncertain in the conventional
uncorrected calculation with Rc = 10000 bohr; the characteristic length of the dominant term of the asymptotic
dispersion potential is 203 bohr. We show details of the convergence in table I; the values shown in table I are unscaled.
The characteristic lengths of the dispersion terms in C6, C8 and C10 are, in bohr, 203, 80 and 50 respectively.

The variable phase method provides a simple way in which account may be taken of the long range dispersion terms
of an interatomic potential in calculations of the eﬀective range. The method gives considerable saving of computation
time and of accumulated truncation error.

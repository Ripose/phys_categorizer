We present a measurement of the lifetime of the metastable 3d 2D5/2 state in the 40Ca+ ion, using
the so-called shelving technique on a string of ﬁve Doppler laser-cooled ions in a linear Paul trap.
A detailed account of the data analysis is given, and systematic eﬀects due to unwanted excitation
processes and collisions with background gas atoms are discussed and estimated. From a total of
6805 shelving events, we obtain a lifetime τ = 1149 ± 14(stat.) ± 4(sys.) ms, a result which is in
agreement with the most recent measurements.

INTRODUCTION

The metastable 3d 2D5/2 state in 40Ca+ is interest-
ing for such diverse areas of physics as atomic structure
calculations, optical frequency standards, quantum infor-
mation and astronomy. For atomic structure calculations
it is an important test case for the study of valence-
core interactions and core-polarization eﬀects [1]. The
long lifetime of the 2D5/2 state implies a sub-Hz nat-
ural linewidth of the 729 nm electric quadrupole transi-
tion to the 2S1/2 ground state, thus making this tran-
sition an attractive candidate for an optical frequency
standard [2, 3]. In addition, its long lifetime makes the
2D5/2 state a suitable choice for one of the two states
in a quantum bit in connection with quantum computa-
tion [4]. Finally, in astronomy, the 2D5/2 state has been
used in a study of the β pictoris disk [5], and it is also
commonly used in the study of Seyfert 1 galaxies and T
Tauri stars [6]. As a consequence, the natural lifetime of
the 2D5/2 state has attracted much attention in recent
years, but unfortunately the results of the many mea-
surements [3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and theoretical
calculations [1, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] of the lifetime are
scattered over a rather broad range (see Fig. 1 in Ref. [7]
for an overview). Among the experimental results, the
lifetime found by Barton et al. [7], using the so-called
shelving technique on a single trapped and laser-cooled
40Ca+ ion, has the smallest error bars, with an estimated
lifetime of τ = 1168

7 ms.

In this paper we present a measurement of the lifetime
of the 3d 2D5/2 state, using the same shelving technique
but on a string of ﬁve ions. The measurement results in
14(stat.)
a lifetime of τ = 1149
The experimental setup and the experimental proce-
dure are described in Section II. In Section III, we give

4(sys.) ms.

a detailed account of the data analysis, including a de-
scription of the maximum likelihood method used for the
statistical data analysis and a discussion of systematic
errors with emphasis on radiation eﬀects and collision ef-
fects. Finally, in Section IV, the estimated lifetime based
on the measurements is given and discussed.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A sketch of our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.
The linear Paul trap used in the experiments is situated
in a stainless steel ultra-high-vacuum chamber. The trap
consists of four cylindrical gold-coated stainless steel rods
arranged in a quadrupole conﬁguration, where two di-
agonally opposite rods are separated by 7.00 mm. The
rods are 8.00 mm in diameter, and each rod is sectioned
into three parts, where the center piece is 5.40 mm long,
and the two end pieces are 20.00 mm long. By applying
an RF-voltage to two diagonally opposite electrode rods
and applying the same voltage with opposite phase to
the other two electrode rods, we obtain an eﬀectively
harmonic radially conﬁning potential.
In the experi-
ments reported here, the peak-peak amplitude of the RF-
voltage is 600 V and the frequency is 3.894 MHz, which
550 kHz.
results in a radial trap frequency of ωr ≈
Axial conﬁnement is provided by a 580 mV DC-voltage
on all eight end electrodes, yielding an axial trap fre-
50 kHz. By adding additional small
quency ωz ≈
DC-voltages to the individual electrodes, we can care-
fully center ions in the trap. At the center of the trap
a collimated atomic Ca beam is crossed by a photoion-
izing laser beam, and 40Ca+ ions are produced by an
isotope-selective resonance-enhanced two-photon ioniza-
tion process [20, 21] and loaded into the trap. The Ca
atomic beam originates from a calcium sample contained
in an oven. The Ca atoms eﬀuse out of a hole in the oven,
and by a number of skimmers a collimated atomic beam
is produced. An oven shutter enables us to fully block
the atomic beam. In the present experiments the oven
was heated to 420◦ C, under which conditions the cham-

ber pressure was measured by an ion gauge [27] to be
10−11 Torr. After having loaded ﬁve ions and forced

them onto a string by adjusting the trap parameters and
applying Doppler laser-cooling as described below, the
oven temperature was reduced, and the oven shutter was

·
Doppler laser-cooled on the 4s 2S1/2-4p 2P1/2 transition
with typically 15 mW of 397 nm light from a frequency-
doubled Ti:Sapphire laser. From the 4p 2P1/2 state, the
ions will not always decay back to the 4s 2S1/2 state
but sometimes decay by a dipole-allowed transition to
the 3d 2D3/2 state, from where they are repumped back
to the 4p 2P1/2 state using a diode laser at 866nm, see
Fig. 2. The ions are observed by collecting ﬂuorescence
light, emitted at 397 nm during the Doppler cooling pro-
cess, with a Nikon objective lens for MM40/60 measuring
microscopes (10x magniﬁcation, f-number
1.7) placed
about 5 cm above the trap center (outside the vacuum
chamber). The collected light is ampliﬁed by an image
intensiﬁer and imaged onto a CCD-camera, resulting in
an all over magniﬁcation of 13.5 for the entire imaging
system [28]. The CCD-camera has a 50 ms exposure time,
and digitial images of the ions with 12-bit resolution are
recorded to the RAM of a personal computer at a frame-
rate of 17.610 Hz.
In order to measure the lifetime of
the 3d 2D5/2 state, during the Doppler cooling process
we excite ions in the 3d 2D3/2 state to the 4p 2P3/2 state
using a diode laser at 850 nm, as shown in Fig. 2. From
the 4p 2P3/2 state the ions can spontaneously decay to
the 3d 2D5/2 state. When the ion is in the 3d 2D5/2
state, the optically active electron of the ion is said to
be shelved, and the ﬂuorescence on the 397 nm transition
is quenched. The time spent by the ion in the 3d 2D5/2
state before it decays back to the ground state, will in
the following be called a shelving period. By continuously
applying the two cooling lasers and the shelving laser at
850 nm, we obtain characteristic ﬂuorescence signals like
the one shown in Fig. 3.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

A. Data reduction

FIG. 2: Relevant levels and transitions in 40Ca+. Doppler
laser cooling is performed with lasers at 397 nm and 866 nm.
A laser at 850 nm excites the ion from the 3d 2D3/2 state to the
4p 2P3/2 state, from where it can decay to the 3d 2D5/2 state.
The dashed line indicates the electric quadrupole transition
by which the ion can decay from the 2D5/2 state to the ground
state.

The lifetime of the 2D5/2 state can easily be estimated
from the distribution of the shelving periods, since we
expect it to be exponential with a time constant equal to
the lifetime τ .

The duration of a shelving period can be determined
by dividing the number of consecutive frames, where an
ion is shelved, by the frame-rate of the CCD-camera.
Our raw data are digital images of ﬁve ions, as shown
200.000
in Fig. 3.a, and our main dataset consists of
such images taken in three one hour experimental runs.
The details of obtaining the distribution of the shelving
periods from these images is described below.

∼

From the images in Fig. 3.a, it is evident that the ions
are spatially well resolved, and that a ’region of interest‘
(ROI) around each ion can be deﬁned. The ROI is 13 x 13
pixels, corresponding to a region of 9.5 µm x 9.5 µm in the
trap region.
In order to establish a ﬂuorescence data-
point which reﬂects the real ion ﬂuorescence rate within
a given image frame, we simply integrate the pixel values
within the ROI. This is a valid measure, since the image
intensiﬁer and the CCD-chip have a linear response to
the ﬂuorescence collected by the objective lens. In the
following the ion ﬂuorescence will be given in integrated
pixel values (IPV).

FIG. 4: Distribution of datapoints from a single ion, binned
in intervals of 500 IPV. The maximum of the narrow back-
ground peak near 4000 IPV is not shown but has a value of
8000. From the Gaussian distribution around 90000 IPV with
a width of σ ∼ 7500 IPV, we can deﬁne a ﬂuorescing level as
the center of this distribution. The inset shows the interme-
diate points between 0 IPV and 80000 IPV.

In order to establish a distribution of the shelving pe-
riods, we need to introduce a threshold level to discrim-
inate between ﬂuorescence datapoints corresponding to
frames where the ion is ﬂuorescing (above the thresh-
old level) or shelved (below the threshold level). From
the distribution of ﬂuorescence datapoints in Fig. 4, it
is evident that we can choose a threshold level which
can be used to unambiguously distinguish between the
background level and the ﬂuorescing level of an ion. The
speciﬁc choice of threshold level is discussed in the fol-
lowing.

From the inset of Fig. 4, it can be seen that the dis-
tribution of ﬂuorescence datapoints contains some points
with a value of the integrated ﬂuorescence between the
background level and the ﬂuorescing level. These inter-
mediate datapoints arise from images where the ion is
only ﬂuorescing during a fraction of the exposure time
of the CCD-chip. This occurs naturally when an ion is
shelved or decays to the ground state during the exposure
of a single frame. Since a particular choice of thresh-
old level decides whether an intermediate datapoint is
counted as belonging to a shelving period or not, it af-
fects the precise distribution of the shelving periods. For-
tunately, the choice of another threshold level on average
only adds a constant amount to all the shelving periods,
and therefore the decay rate extracted from their distri-
bution is not inﬂuenced by the choice of threshold level.
This fact allows us to choose a threshold level in a broad
range between the background level and the ﬂuorescing
level.

Unfortunately,

intermediate ﬂuorescence datapoints
also occur in the following three situations:
i) shelv-
ing followed by fast decay to the ground state, ii) decay

FIG. 3: (a) A sequence of CCD-images including a shelv-
ing event for the central ion. The white square indicates the
’region of interest‘ (ROI) within which the ﬂuorescence is in-
tegrated to obtain the signal shown in (b). (b) Fluorescence
signal from the central ion for an image sequence containing
the nine images above. The datapoints corresponding to the
nine images are indicated by open circles. The dashed line
indicates the threshold level discussed in the text.

∼

As shown in Fig. 4, the distribution of the ﬂuorescence
datapoints from a single ion is characterized by a rather
sharp peak at a low ﬂuorescence level and a Gaussian
distribution of datapoints around a level of
90000 IPV,
originating from cases where the ion is scattering 397 nm
light during a whole frame. In the following we deﬁne
the ﬂuorescing level as the center of the Gaussian distri-
bution. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distri-
bution is σ ∼ 7500 IPV, which is mainly set by image-
intensiﬁer noise, but also by laser intensity and frequency
drifts during the experimental run, and by the ﬁnite ion
temperature. The peak at the low ﬂuorescence level, or
the background level, is due to datapoints originating
from cases where the ion is shelved during a whole frame.
This background peak is asymmetric with a sharp left
edge, since there is essentially no 397 nm light scattered
into the ROI’s, when the ions are shelved.

to the ground state followed by fast re-shelving, iii) a
shelved and an unshelved ion change places, e.g., due to
a weak collision with a background gas atom or molecule
or due to the ﬁnite temperature of the ions. Examples of
these events, all taking place within one or two camera
frames, are shown in Fig 5.a-c. Hence, before we choose
the threshold level to be used for extracting the distribu-
tion of shelving periods, we have to consider these three
types of events in some detail.

i) When an ion is shelved at a certain instant of a frame
and decays back to the ground state within that same
frame or the next, then the signal does not necessarily
fall below the threshold level, as the example in Fig. 5.a.
shows. Hence these events may not even be counted as
shelving events. In the data analysis we simply account
for such events by discarding all periods with a duration
of one or two frames from the shelving period distribu-
tion. Since the distribution is expected to be exponential,
we can subsequently displace the remaining distribution,
so that periods originally having a duration of n frames
(n
2
3) are set to be periods with a duration of n
≥
frames.

(F

ii) If an ion decays and is quickly re-shelved, we can-
not be conﬁdent that the signal rises above the threshold
level, see Fig. 5.b, and thus two shelving periods can
appear as one longer shelving period, which would arti-
ﬁcially increase the extracted lifetime. Noting that such
events require a high shelving rate, it is possible to ex-
clude them on probability grounds. First, we set a low
threshold level, T = 0.1
B)+B, where F is the ﬂuo-
−
rescing level, and B is the background level, which means
that only the very fastest re-shelving events do not rise
above the threshold level. Second, we require that after a
decay, which ends a shelving period, there must be twenty
consecutive datapoints above the threshold level; other-
wise it is not counted as a shelving period in the data
analysis. This requirement is only likely to be fulﬁlled
with a low shelving rate, thus reducing the risk of ac-
cepting shelving periods where a quick re-shelving event
has happened. The probability for an event of decay and
quick reshelving, with the signal not rising above the se-
lected threshold level, followed by a decay and twenty
consecutive datapoints above the threshold level, is be-
low 2 permille regardless of the shelving rate. Hence this
method gives at most a systematic error of -2 ms to the
ﬁnal result, and we will take the systematic error to be

±

−

1 ms.

iii) As mentioned, two ions may change place, e.g.,
due to a weak collision with a background gas atom or
molecule. Fig. 5.c shows how a shelved and an unshelved
ion changing place, eﬀectively cut one long shelving pe-
riod into two shorter ones, which artiﬁcially shortens the
extracted lifetime. Therefore, in such events we restore
the position of the ions to obtain a single shelving event,
as shown in Fig. 5.d. Positions are only restored if the
value of the ﬂuorescence datapoints for the two ions in-
volved adds up to the ﬂuorescing level F within
2σ of
this level. We ﬁnd about 200 such events in our main

±

dataset. Since statistically the ﬂuorescence from the two
ions does not add up to the ﬂuorescing level within
2σ
in all events, we estimate a systematic error to the life-
time of +2 ms. True events of one ion shelving and an-
other decaying within the same fraction of a frame will,
however, occur, and erroneously be corrected by this pro-
10 ms due to
cedure. We estimate a systematic error of
the erroneously corrected events. All together the sys-
tematic error due to ions switching place is
8 ms, with
an estimated uncertainty of

±
During data-taking it happened that the ions heated
up, so the ion-string became unstable. Such events are
clearly visible on the images of the ions and were cut out
of the dataset before performing the data reduction pro-
cess described above. Likewise, periods where the lasers
were adjusted or unstable are not considered in the fur-
ther data analysis.

(F

After the data reduction process described above and
using a threshold level of T = 0.1
B)+B, we extract
a distribution of the shelving periods for each ion, binned
in time intervals of ∆t = 56.786 ms, which is the inverse
of the frame-rate. The counts in equivalent bins for all
the ions in the three experimental runs are then added to
obtain a single distribution, from which a decay rate can
be determined. This distribution is shown in a histogram
in Fig. 6, with the bins shifted such that the histogram
has its origin at time zero.

B. Statistical analysis

From the histogram in Fig. 6, we can infer the lifetime
τ of the 2D5/2 state by assuming an exponential distribu-
tion with a decay rate given by the inverse lifetime of the
2D5/2 state. The histogram is comprised of 6805 shelving
events with duration up to more than 11 seconds. Since,
at large times, there are only a small number of events in
the distribution, a least squares ﬁtting method is inap-
propriate, and hence we employ a maximum likelihood
estimate instead.

As a check of the eﬃciency and validity of our data
reduction process, we have performed a test of goodness-
of-ﬁt. To ﬁnd the goodness-of-ﬁt we employ the Kol-
mogorov test, which is based on the Empirical Distribu-
tion Function. A general overview of EDF statistics can
be found in Ref. [23], which also gives tables of signif-
icance levels appropriate for cases like ours, where the
lifetime is estimated from the data set. We ﬁnd from our
data a value for the Kolmogorov test of 0.44, clearly be-
low the 10% signiﬁcance level value of 0.995, thus showing
that the ﬁt is good. We note for completeness that our
data set is binned, whereas the values in Ref. [23] are for
continuous data. However, since we have more than 100
channels this is not expected to play any signiﬁcant role.

is possibly due to this previously unrecognized source of
error. To reduce the level of 854 nm light from the diode
lasers as much as possible, a long-pass ﬁlter was inserted
in the 866 nm beamline and adjusted (by changing the
angle of incidence) to 30% transmission at 866nm and
10−4 at 854 nm, and a grating (1200 lines/mm)
. 5
with a spectrally selective diaphragm (0.9 mm diameter,
1080 mm from the grating) was inserted in the 850 nm
beamline. The ﬁlter, the grating and the diaphragm are
shown in Fig. 1. The overall power of the lasers was re-
duced to
1.7 mW at the place of the ions,
for the shelving laser and the repumping laser, respec-
tively. The waist size of the beams was 670 µm

In order to estimate the lifetime reduction due to ra-
diation emitted from the diode lasers, we calculate the
rate of de-shelving from the 2D5/2 state, i.e., the excita-
tion rate from the 2D5/2 state to the 2P3/2 state times
b), where b = 0.068 is the branching ratio for decay
(1
from the 2P3/2 state back to the 2D5/2 state [24].

−

First we consider de-shelving due to the repumping
laser, which we split into two contributions, one from
the oﬀ-resonant 866 nm radiation and one from the near-
resonant background radiation around 854 nm. The de-
shelving rate due to the 866 nm radiation was calculated
10−5 s−1/(mWmm−2),
by Barton et. al. [7] to I866
·
where I866 is the intensity of 866 nm radiation. With
I866 = 2.3 mWmm−2 we ﬁnd a de-shelving rate of 2.2
10−4 s−1, yielding a lifetime reduction of 0.3 ms.

·
In order to calculate the excitation rate from the 2D5/2
state to the 2P3/2 state due to radiation near 854 nm,
we ﬁrst consider the rate at a given frequency ωL, as
expressed by Eq. (2) in Ref. [7]:

C. Radiation, collisions and other potential
systematic eﬀects

Apart from the systematic errors concerning the data
reduction, already discussed in Section III A, there are a
few other relevant systematic errors, which will be dis-
cussed in this section.

1. Radiation

From the level scheme of Fig. 2, it is obvious that any
radiation which couples the 2D5/2 state to the 2P3/2
state may deplete the 2D5/2 state by excitation to the
2P3/2 state followed by decay to the 2S1/2 ground state
or the 2D3/2 state and result in a measured lifetime
shorter than the natural lifetime. As a consequence, the
occurrence of such radiation must be considered and, if
possible, reduced. Blackbody radiation at the relevant
transition wavelength is negligible at room temperature,
as also discussed by Barton et al. [7]. Other ‘thermal’
sources such as the ion gauge, roomlight and computer
screens were oﬀ during the measuring sessions, except for
the screen where we watched the images of the ions. This
screen was facing away from the vacuum chamber and is
hence not expected to cause any problems. Another class
of inﬂuencing light sources is the lasers used in the experi-
ment. In particular the broad background of the emission
spectrum of the 866 nm and the 850 nm diode lasers con-
tains 854 nm light resonant with the 2D5/2- 2P3/2 transi-
tion. This radiation source was ﬁrst recognized by Block
et al. [8], and as noted by Barton et al. [7] the discrepancy
between their own and many of the earlier measurements

·

As a check of this estimate, we performed an experi-
ment, again with ﬁve ions, with the cooling lasers on but
without the shelving laser. Even without the shelving
laser the ions may be shelved due to radiation from the
866 nm repumping laser, which couples the 2D3/2 state
to the 2P3/2 state. From the observed shelving rate, we
can then ﬁnd the excitation rate on the 850 nm 2D3/2-
2P3/2 transition and compare it to the calculated excita-
tion rate for the 854 nm 2D5/2- 2P3/2 transition, taking
the diﬀerent linestrengths into account.
In this exper-
iment the power of the 866 nm laser was 7.3 mW, the
waist was as above, the long-pass ﬁlter was removed and
the oven-shutter was open. In about 35 minutes we ob-
served 12 shelving events, i.e., the observed shelving-rate
10−3 s−1. Taking into account the number of ions,
is 5.8
1/3, since both cool-
the population of the D-state (
ing transitions are saturated) and the branching ratio b,
we ﬁnd the excitation rate on the 2D3/2- 2P3/2 transi-
10−2 s−1. By multiply-
tion: (3/5b)
ing this number with the relative linestrength between
the 2D5/2- 2P3/2 transition and the 2D3/2- 2P3/2 transi-
tion of 8.92 [24], we ﬁnd an estimated value of 0.45 s−1
for the excitation rate on the 2D5/2- 2P3/2 transition,
which should be compared to R = 0.77 s−1 calculated
above. The two numbers are not expected to be equal
but only of the same order of magnitude, since the tran-
sition wavelengths are diﬀerent, and the diode laser back-
ground is not necessarily equally strong near 850 nm and
854 nm. Also some of the shelving events may be due to
collisions, as discussed below. Nevertheless, the numbers
agree within a factor of 2 and our calculated estimate of
the excitation rate, and hence the de-shelving rate seems
to be reasonable.

Above we considered de-shelving due to the repump-
ing laser.
In exactly the same way we could consider
de-shelving due to the shelving laser. However, since
the intensity of the shelving laser is much lower than
for the repumping laser, and the grating and the di-
aphragm strongly reduce the level of 854 nm light, the ex-
citation rate is expected to be extremely small. To check
this we performed additional lifetime measurements at
three diﬀerent power levels of the shelving laser, 18 nW,
193 nW and 2081 nW, yielding lifetimes of 1146
24 ms,
1160
27 ms, respectively. When using
higher power, the laser was detuned from resonance to
get a similar shelving rate in all experiments. In Fig. 7,
the linear ﬁt to the decay rates corresponding to the life-
times shows that there is a weak dependence of the de-
cay rate (or lifetime) on the 850 nm power. However,
with only 18 nW the lifetime is only reduced by 0.5 ms.
The results of the two low power measurements and the
crossing at zero power are in agreement with the result
obtained from our main dataset. The measurement at
18 nW was in fact performed at the same shelving laser
power as the measurements for the main dataset.

lasers.

2. Collisions

Another systematic eﬀect which shortens the mea-
sured lifetime is collisions with background gas atoms
and molecules. There are two relevant types of colli-
sions: ﬁne-structure changing (j-mixing) collisions and
quenching collisions.
In a j-mixing collision the inter-
nal state can change from the 2D5/2 state to the 2D3/2
state, or vice versa. In a quenching collision the internal
state changes from the 2D5/2 state to the 2S1/2 ground
state. Both types of collisions deplete the 2D5/2 state
j-mixing and
and hence shorten the measured lifetime.
quenching rate constants (Γj and ΓQ) in the presence
of diﬀerent gases are given in Ref. [25] and references
therein. Quite generally j-mixing collisions are found to
be an order of magnitude stronger than quenching col-
lisions. From a restgas analysis [29], we know that the
restgas in our vacuum chamber is mainly composed of
H2 and gas of 28 atomic mass units, i.e., N2 or CO. In
the restgas analysis it was not possible to distinguish
between N2 and CO, since the chamber pressure was
so low that the signal from the atomic constituents of
these molecules could not be observed. Knoop et al. [25]
found the following rate constants in units of cm3s−1 for
10−10,
collisions with H2 and N2: Γj(H2) = (3
10−10
ΓQ(H2) = (37
14)
10−12. The measurements were
and ΓQ(N2) = (170
performed on a cloud of relatively hot ions, as compared
to the laser cooled ions considered in this paper. As
noted in Ref. [25], other measurements of j-mixing with
H2 at diﬀerent collision energies give similar results, so
we may expect only a weak energy-dependence for the j-
mixing collisions, and therefore we use the values given in

±
10−12, Γj(N2) = (12.6

Ref. [25]. On the other hand, higher quenching rates are
expected at lower temperatures [25], but to our knowl-
edge there are no measurements of that for Ca+. Unfor-
tunately, we are not aware of any similar measurements
with CO, and in our estimate of the collision rate below,
we therefore assume that the mass 28 restgas is N2. The
relatively large rate constants of N2 found in Ref. [25]
indicate that at least this assumption probably does not
lead to a large underestimate of the collision induced de-
shelving rate.

·

·

±

Assuming that the values given in Ref. [25] are applica-
ble, we can estimate the collision-induced lifetime reduc-
10−11 Torr, taking into account
tion. At a pressure of 5
the sensitivity to diﬀerent gases of the ion gauge and us-
ing the result of the restgas analysis, we ﬁnd that the
restgas is composed of 54%H2 and 46%N2, which yields
10−3 s−1,
a total collision induced de-shelving rate of 2.3
and a systematic error to the lifetime of +3 ms with an
estimated uncertainty of

1 ms .
From the measurement of 12 shelving events in 35
minutes without the shelving laser on, as described in
Sec. III C 1 above, we can obtain an upper limit for the
j-mixing collision rate if we assume that all the observed
shelving events are due to j-mixing collisions inducing
a transition from the 2D3/2 state to the 2D5/2 state
(with rate γ35). Again taking the number of ions and
the population of the 2D3/2 state into account, the col-
10−3 s−1. Since the
lision induced shelving rate is 3.5
oven shutter was open in that experiment, thus allowing
collisions with neutral calcium atoms as well, we expect
this number to be larger than under the conditions for
the ‘real’ lifetime measurements. The transition rate,
γ53, for the 2D5/2- 2D3/2 de-shelving transition is ex-
pected to be given by γ53 = 2γ35/3, owing to the principle
of detailed balance, so the collision induced de-shelving
10−3 s−1. This is our upper limit for the j-
rate is 2.3
mixing collision rate, which should be compared to our
estimate above of the total collision-induced de-shelving
rate, which is dominated by contributions from j-mixing
collisions. Somewhat fortuitously, the numbers are equal,
and hence our calculated estimate seems to be reason-
able.

3. Other eﬀects

When observing shelving events from a string of ions,
one might consider if there are any correlations in the
decay of the individual ions from the 2D5/2 state to the
ground state, which could inﬂuence the measured life-
time. In the experiments by Block et al. [8] indications
of correlated decays from the 2D5/2 state were observed,
manifested as an overrepresentation of events where sev-
eral ions decay at the same time. A later detailed ex-
periment by Donald et al. [14] showed, however, no such
correlations. Apart from sudden bursts of 854 nm ra-
diation, the only reasonable physical mechanism which
could lead to correlations is so-called subradiant and su-

or

perradiant spontaneous emission due to interference in
the spontaneous decay of two or more ions [26].
In
the simple case of two ions, superradiant and subradi-
ant spontaneous emission is characterized by a relative
change in the normal (single ion) decay rate of the order
of
sin(kR)/kR (when kR > 10), where R is the ion-ion
distance, k = 2π/λ with λ = 729 nm in our case [30]. For
more ions the eﬀect is of the same order of magnitude. In
10−3 so just from this argument the
our case 1/kR
eﬀect is small, but not negligible. The interference eﬀect,
however, relies on creating and maintaining a superposi-
)/√2, where

tion state of the form

S and D indicate the internal state, 2S1/2 or 2D5/2, and
indices 1 and 2 relate to Ion 1 and Ion 2.
In our ex-
periment such a superposition state can only be created
by a random process since the 2D5/2 state is only pop-
ulated through spontaneous emission, and consequently
the relative phase between the states

|
is expected to be random. This fact would in itself av-
erage out the eﬀect on the lifetime. In addition, if the
superposition state is created, it is immediately (as com-
pared to τ ) destroyed since, from a quantum mechanical
point of view, we are constantly measuring the internal
state of the ions. So any super- or subradiant eﬀect is
in fact expected to be destroyed, and we do not expect
any correlation in decays from the 2D5/2 state. We have
checked our data for correlated decays, and indeed a sta-
tistical analysis shows no evidence of correlations.

In Ref. [7] mixing of the 2D5/2 state with the 2P3/2
state due to static electric ﬁelds was considered and found
to be negligible. For our trap we also ﬁnd this eﬀect to
be negligible.

Finally, we note that the read-out time of the camera
inﬂuences the measured duration of the shelving periods.
As for the choice of threshold level, the read-out time has
no eﬀect on the measured decay rate and hence on the
measured lifetime.

4. The total eﬀect of systematic errors

Above we have identiﬁed and evaluated systematic
errors originating from the data analysis and from de-
shelving due to radiation and collisions. An overview of
the estimated errors and their uncertainties is given in
Table I.

The eﬀects leading to the systematic errors can be
modelled by extra decay rates added to the natural decay
rate:

where τmeas is the measured lifetime as determined from
the maximum likelihood estimate, τnat is the natural life-
time, and the γi’s are the extra decay rates, which can
attain both positive and negative values in this model.
The systematic errors given in the text and Table I cor-
respond to τ 2
measγi. Eq. (8) shows that the systematic
errors should be added linearly, yielding -5 ms, and added
to the result of the maximum likelihood estimate, giving
a lifetime of 1149 ms. The uncertainties of the system-
atic errors are independent, and therefore they are added
quadratically, yielding an uncertainty of

4 ms.

IV. RESULT AND CONCLUSION

By correcting the maximum likelihood estimate with
-5 ms, as described above, we ﬁnd that our ﬁnal result
for the lifetime measurement is

τnat = 1149

The largest error is the statistical, but we do have a non-
negligible systematic uncertainty, originating from the
correction procedure when ions change places. The asso-
ciated error, and hence the uncertainty, could be reduced
by increasing our signal-to-noise ratio, which would nar-
row the time window where real events of simultaneous
decay and shelving for two diﬀerent ions could be taken
for two ions changing place. The signal-to-noise ratio can
be improved by frequency locking the Ti:Sapphire laser
and power stabilizing the output from the doubling cav-
ity. From Eq. (4) we see that the statistical uncertainty
can only be reduced by a longer data acquisition time
(increasing N), and not simply by increasing the frame-

9

rate, since the second term in the expansion is already
negligible in our case.

Our measurement was performed with a string of ions,
unlike most other shelving experiments. In all single ion
experiments, one has to consider the fact that the ion
may heat up, so the ﬂuorescence level drops signiﬁcantly,
and the ion can appear to be shelved, although it is not.
In our experiment with ﬁve ions on a string, we can detect
and discard all events of this kind since if one ion or sev-
eral ions heat up, we would see the remaining ions move
or heat up as well. Moreover, with a string of ions, the
shelved ions are sympathetically cooled by the unshelved
ions, so the number of heating events are expected to be
reduced using a string of ions, as compared to single ion
experiments. The major drawback of using a string of
ions is that ions may change places, which inﬂuences the
measured lifetime if this is not taken care of in the data
analysis, as demonstrated here.

In conclusion, we have measured the lifetime of the
metastable 3d 2D5/2 state in the 40Ca+ ion using the
shelving technique on a string of ﬁve ions. Our result
agrees roughly at the level of one standard deviation
with the already mentioned result obtained by Barton et
al. [7], with the value reported in Ref. [3] and with two
theoretical papers [16, 17]. On the level of two standard
deviations, the result agrees with two other measure-
ments where de-shelving due to diode lasers was taken
into account [8, 14] and with the storage-ring measure-
ment by Lidberg et al. [9]. The most recent measured
values [3, 7], including our result, are in good agreement
and group themselves around a value of about 1160 ms
within 1% of that value. This newly obtained level of
agreement should provide valuable input to future atomic
structure calculations and astrononomical studies.

An exact theory for the density of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate with hard core
particle interactions is developed in second quantization and applied to the scattering of the con-
densate by a spatially periodic impulse potential. The boson problem is mapped onto a system of
free fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion principle to facilitate the calculation. The density exhibits
a spatial focusing of the probability density as well as a periodic self-imaging in time, or Talbot
eﬀect. Furthermore, the transition from single particle to many body eﬀects can be measured by
observing the decay of the modulated condensate density pattern in time. The connection of these
results to classical and atom optical phase gratings is made explicit.

I. INTRODUCTION

The recent interest in neutral atom Bose-Einstein con-
densates [1,2] and in periodic eﬀects [3–5] in atom optics
has stimulated research in those ﬁelds. Experiments are
at the point now where the condensate can be manipu-
lated [6] and used for precision measurement and atom
optical studies. From a theoretical perspective much can
be learned by applying the methods developed over the
past four decades in condensed matter research to these
ﬁelds. Similarly, new eﬀects from a condensed matter
viewpoint can be introduced by adopting the knowledge
gained over the years in mathematical physics, optics,
and atomic physics. With this motivation we detail the
theory of a one-dimensional condensate with hard-core
particle-particle interactions subjected to a spatially pe-
riodic, impulsive interaction. The subsequent evolution
of the system probes the onset of many-body eﬀects rep-
resented by the interactions.

The results are summarized as follows. The conden-
sate of interacting bosons can be mapped onto a system
of free fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.
The boson-boson interaction in one-dimension acts like
the Fermi repulsion to create a parabolic band of occu-
pied states. If we are interested in observables, such as
the density, which probe the diagonal density matrix el-
ements of the system, the diﬀerence between the fermion
and boson commutation relations is irrelevant to our re-
sults.

≪

Using this fermion model, we show that an exact ex-
pression for the density after the periodic interaction can
be derived for the case of a pulse with duration τ such
~, where the Fermi and recoil en-
that max[ǫkF τ, ǫqτ ]
ergies, ǫkF and ǫq, respectively, are deﬁned below. This
density describes both the one-dimensional interacting
bosons and the noninteracting (degenerate) Fermi gas.
Since the density becomes spatially modulated after the
interaction, regions of high density, or focal spots, can
arise when the spatial harmonics at a certain time su-
perpose in phase at certain points in space and out of

1

phase in others.
In addition, the spatially modulated
density exhibits a Talbot eﬀect, resulting from the peri-
odic self-imaging or wave packet revival of each fermion’s
time-dependent, single particle wave function. Simulta-
neously, the inhomogeneous dephasing due to the initial
Fermi distribution of momenta causes a decay in time
of the spatial modulation. Since the Talbot eﬀect is a
coherent, single particle phenomenon and the distribu-
tion of initial momenta represents the interactions in the
system, in some sense the decay of the modulated den-
sity in the condensate measures the crossover from single
particle to many-body physics in an interacting system.

II. THE MODEL

We consider N bosons with hard core interactions in a
one–dimensional “box” of length L with periodic bound-
ary conditions. The Hamiltonian H for this system cor-
0
responds to particles with mass M and radius a
interacting via eﬀective point or δ–function interactions

The eﬀect of the interactions is to introduce nodes in the
many–particle eigenstate wave functions whenever two
coordinates coincide: the bosons are impenetrable. The
problem of impenetrable bosons in one dimension has a
very close relationship to the problem of free fermions.
The energy eigenfunctions diﬀer only by a multiplica-
tive function with value
1 which symmetrizes the anti-
symmetric fermion eigenstates to form boson states, and
the corresponding eigenvalues are identical [7,8]. The
ki}
eigenstates can be labeled by a set of wave vectors
with i = 1,
L ni, and ni integers satisfy-
= nj. We take N odd. The N even case can be

treated similarly [8].

core interaction has been absorbed into the deﬁnition of
the ﬁeld operators which must be used to construct any
state. This is a key point. As a result of the condi-
tion (a†
x)2 = 0, the boson ground state cannot be easily
constructed from the vacuum using the creation and an-
nihilation operators, a†
k and ak. Furthermore, we do not
know how to calculate the state rotation caused by inter-
action operators (i.e., a pulse) on arbitrary boson states.
However, the fermion energy eigenstates are well known,
and the ability to determine the action of operators on
any fermion state allows us to perform tractable calcula-
tions.

This diﬀerence arises from the commutation relations. As
a direct result, the commutation relations allow for the
possibility of having more than one interacting boson in
the k = 0 state as long as two bosons are not at the same
position, whereas for free fermions the exclusion principle
limits the occupation probability of the k = 0 state to one
or zero.

core interactions, Lenard showed that Nc ∼ O
This implies that in the thermodynamic limit the par-
ticle density vanishes in the condensate. However, for a
ﬁnite system there can still be a large number of particles
in the condensate. This vanishing density is connected
to the fact that there is no Bose–Einstein condensation
in one–dimension for a free Bose gas at ﬁnite tempera-
ture. Even though we are considering here the limit of
zero temperature, the quantum ﬂuctuations generated by
the hard core interactions are enough to destroy the con-
densate in the limit of inﬁnite particle number. Given
the above proviso, our model is relevant for the under-
standing of interactions since an inﬁnite, non–intensive
number of particles remains in the lowest lying state.

One can prove [see Appendix A] that the action of this
pulse on either the fermion or boson ground state leads
to the same time-dependent, spatially-modulated den-
sity at zero temperature given the above connection be-
tween fermion and boson eigenstates and eigenenergies.
The crucial feature in the proof is that both the pulse
operator and the diagonal elements of the density ma-
trix depend only on the boson coordinates (the position
x and the diagonal operator a†
x ax in second quantiza-
tion). These operators preserve the symmetrization of
the fermion states to form boson states. Therefore, while
the occupation probability of k-states is distinct for the
interacting bosons and free fermions, the density of the
Fermi system mirrors the collective behavior of the many-
body (correlated) boson wave function for particles sep-
arated on average by a distance d. Furthermore, the fact
that the fermions act as free particles enables us to cal-
culate the results for the interacting Bose gas exactly.

¿From this equation the calculation shows that, as far
as the density is concerned, each particle with initial
momentum ~k acts independently, multiply-scattering
the pulsed interaction to form momentum components
~(k + sq). The components of the perturbed particle
then propagate to time t with their free energies, ǫk+sq.
The total density at t is formed by the interference of
each particle’s individual momentum components, aver-
aged over the initial momentum distribution fk. This av-
eraging process determines whether collective eﬀects ow-
ing to particle-particle interactions dominate (q
2kF )
or whether the coherent interference of each particle with
itself dominates (q
2kF ). The dephasing caused by in-
teractions results in a decay of the density pattern as a
function of time.

For the q

~q2jt/(2M ) is arbitrary, we can ignore the decoherence
by setting Ij (t)
I0 = kF /π = ρ0, the background
density. In this limit the total density is a periodic func-
tion of time with period τT = 2π/(~q2/(2M )). This is
the Talbot eﬀect from classical and atom optics, where
the periodicity of a diﬀraction grating is imposed on a
transmitted wave, and τT is the Talbot period [10–12]. In
those cases the transverse wave intensity or density in the
Fresnel regime of diﬀraction becomes periodic in space
and time in exactly the manner of Eq. (29). The ini-
tial, uniform density evolves into a spatially-modulated
density and back again.

If 4λ & 1, a third time scale, τf = 2M/(4λ~q2) =
τT /(8πλ), is implicit in the expression for the density, Eq.
(29). For t
τf the particle distribution is focused to an
array of focal spots with density peaks of magnitude > ρ0
at the positions qxf = 2πm for all integers m [12,13]. As
a result of the Talbot eﬀect, these focuses also reappear
at later times t = nτT /2

This situation corresponds to the limit for which the
momentum “kicks” due to the applied pulse are smaller
than the momentum uncertainty in the ground state, and
one expects the Talbot eﬀect to be washed out for higher
harmonics. From Ij (t) we see that the largest harmonic
that survives up to the Talbot time is that for which

die away before the pattern can be “reconstructed” at
τT . In quasi–classical language, a particle that absorbs
d/(~jq/M ) to travel
momentum j~q takes a time τc ∼
the inter–particle distance d = π/kF and collide with
its neighboring particle.
If τc is much longer than the
Talbot time τT , the particle acts as a free particle for
multiple Talbot times, and the response of that harmonic
will be insensitive to the particle–particle interactions.

To continue the analogy with classical and atom optics
[10,14] including the decoherence factor Ij(t), the density
of Eq. (29) is isomorphic to the behavior of the atomic
density when a beam of neutral atoms with beam diver-
gence θ = 2~kF /Mavz ≪

wave phase grating with periodicity 2π/q, where Ma is
the atomic mass, vz = z/t is the longitudinal beam speed,
and 2~kF /Ma plays the role of the transverse velocity
spread ux. In that case, the probability distribution of
transverse atomic velocities is taken as P (vx) = 1/ux for

one-dimension. A similar correspondence holds for the
divergence angle, θ = 2kF /kz, of a light beam in the
paraxial approximation passing through a periodic opti-
cal phase grating. As a result, Ij(t) corresponds to the
Doppler dephasing caused by a uniform, inhomogeneous
distribution of particles with initial wave vectors between
kF with respect to the momentum kick wave vectors
±
jq. The sinusoidal behavior of Ij(t) arises from the uni-
formity of the Fermi distribution over a ﬁnite interval
of k-states. Other inhomogeneous distribution functions,
such as a thermal distribution of particle velocities in the
atom beam case, may lead to a smooth decay in time.

still apparent while the second is vague. This is a regime

kF /q = 0.1 is indistinguishable from the kF /q = 0 case.
By the second focal time in Fig. 3b, the kF /q = 1.5 case
has returned to nearly uniform density (i.e., the t

limit), and the kF /q = 0.1 case, denoted by the dash-dot
line, has started to damp. In Fig. 3c both cases kF /q
= 0
have nearly uniform densities at t = τT + τf , the focus
after one Talbot time. From these plots it is clear that
a comparison of the normalized density as a function of
time can act as a sensitive measure of the time scales for
which many-body eﬀects become important compared to
single particle eﬀects.

V. PERTURBATION LIMITS AND
FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES

By looking at the perturbative limit of these results,
insight is gained into the fundamental processes taking
place in this system.
In particular, the cases of large
spatial period (q

2kF ) pulses can be further distinguished. Taking the
perturbative limit of Eq. (29) to ﬁrst order in λ, only
the lowest-order harmonic survives. The result is

This is the lowest-order quantum scattering limit where
interactions dominate. The density modulation has a
small amplitude, 2λq/kF , and is periodic in time with
frequency qvF . The sinusoidal time dependence can be
traced to the uniform Fermi distribution of momenta.
Thus, in the limit q
2kF a small amplitude modu-
lation can be created on a length scale 2π/q such that
L

like a classical Doppler modulation of the density as a
function of time. For q

VI. CONCLUSION

The exact results showing the focusing and Talbot ef-
fects in a one-dimensional condensate may have direct
application to a number of neutral atom experiments em-
ploying conﬁned Bose-Einstein condensates or beams of
cold atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate [1,6]. Hope-
fully, some knowledge has been gained into the role of in-
teractions and/or inhomogeneity in causing the decay of
coherent properties in these type of systems when probed
by transient interactions.

This paper has also shown the power of using tradi-
tional condensed matter techniques both to solve new
problems in solid state physics and to map problems from
atomic or optical physics onto solid state equivalents.
The exact density, Eq. (29), is equally valid for a one-
dimensional Fermi system at zero temperature and could
be adapted for fermions at ﬁnite temperatures. Further-
more, the correspondence between fermions and bosons
can be extended within this hard core interaction model
to include a conﬁning potential in one-dimension, such
as a harmonic trap. The many-body ground state wave
function of the bosons is the absolute value of a Slater
determinant of the ﬁrst N single-particle energy eigen-
states of the conﬁning potential. For the oscillator case
the eigenstates are separated by ~ω, and the condensate
ground state has the total energy N 2~ω/2. Whether this
ground state corresponds to a true Bose condensate ac-
cording to the Penrose and Onsager criterion [9] is an
open question.

In addition, we have shown that the density formed by
the bosons and fermions after the pulse takes the same

12

form as the density of N independent particles with a
uniform, inhomogeneous momentum distribution passing
through a standing wave phase grating. As a result, us-
ing the analogy with atom optics, we expect that the
recoil oscillations and focusing eﬀects in the boson and
fermion systems could be recovered with echo techniques
by applying a second pulse to rephase the diﬀerent den-
sity harmonics [4].

APPENDIX A: PROOF OF CORRESPONDENCE
BETWEEN BOSON AND FERMION
OBSERVABLES

The relationship between free fermions and hard core
bosons in one dimension was established by Girardeau
[7] and Lenard [8]. Each anti-symmetric fermion energy
eigenstate φ(F )
(x1...xN ) is a Slater determinant of N
single-particle states. Each many-particle boson energy
eigenstate φ(B)
(x1...xN ) has the same energy Ee as its
corresponding fermion state. The boson eigenfunctions

The operator A(x1...xN ) is a many-particle function tak-
ing the values

state under interchange of coordinates.

±

The following is a proof using these relationships that
the (single-particle) density and other operators which
are diagonal in coordinate space are the same for certain
states of the Bose or Fermi system. The boson density
as a function of time is deﬁned as

ρ(x, t) =

Z

Z

The key point of the proof arises here. In order to write
the density of Eq. (A8) entirely in terms of the Fermi
(A9) can not contain the symmetrization
system, Eq.
function A. This implies that A must commute with U ,

[U, A(x1...xN −1, x)] = 0,

(A10)

giving the coeﬃcients

Ce =

...

dx1...dxN −1dxφ∗(F )

e U Ψ(F )

(A11)

Z

Condition (A10) is satisﬁed if U depends only on the co-
ordinates x1...xN −1, x. (In particular, the pulse operator
from Eq. (13) above,

14

U = exp[i2λ

cos(qxj )/~],

(A12)

j
X

obeys condition (A10).)
If this is the case, the time-
dependent density is deﬁned by Eqs. (A8) and (A11) for
both Bose and Fermi systems prepared by the operator
U .

In general, when Eq. (A11) is inserted into (A8), the

density can be written in second quantized form as

This is Eq. (20a) from the text. While the density oper-
ator in second quantized form c†
xcx is automatically di-
agonal, from Eq. (A13) it is clear that if condition (A10)
is obeyed, the expectation value of any operator which is
diagonal in x can be calculated using this boson-fermion
correspondence.

FIG. 4.

Perturbation Theory. The density along the
planes qx = 2πm from the exact result [Eq. (29)], ρ(0, t)/ρ0,
is plotted versus time for λ = 0.05. The lowest-order spa-
tial harmonic dominates the modulated density in all cases,
reproducing the perturbative result [Eq.
(33)]. The beat-
ing between the Talbot period τT and the dephasing period
τT /(2kF /q) is evident. (a) kF /q = 6 - the density goes like
Eq. (34a) for times t/τT ≪ 1 but (2kF /q)(t/τT ) ∼ 1. (b)
kF /q = 0.125 - Talbot oscillations dominate according to Eq.
(35) for times (2kF /q)(t/τT ) ≪ 1 but t/τT ∼ 1. (c) Degen-
erate case, kF /q = 0.5 - the Talbot and dephasing oscillation
are in phase with the single time scale τT . In all cases the sig-
nal begins to decay as the dephasing oscillations beat against
the Talbot oscillations.

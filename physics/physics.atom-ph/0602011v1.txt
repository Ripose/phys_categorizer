A Cs fountain electron electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment using electric-ﬁeld quantization
is demonstrated. With magnetic ﬁelds reduced to ≤ 200 pT, the electric ﬁeld lifts the degeneracy
between hyperﬁne levels of diﬀerent |mF | and, along with the slow beam and fountain geometry,
suppresses systematics from motional magnetic ﬁelds. Transitions are induced and the atoms polar-
ized and analyzed in ﬁeld-free regions. The feasibility of reaching a sensitivity to an electron EDM
of 2 × 10−50 C-m (1.3 × 10−29 e-cm) in a cesium fountain experiment is discussed.

The observation of a permanent electric dipole moment
(EDM) of a fundamental particle or nucleus requires that
both parity (P) and time-reversal invariance (T) be vi-
olated, where T violation is equivalent to charge-parity
(CP) violation. The ﬂavor-changing CP violation con-
tained in the Standard Model generates EDMs too small
to be experimentally observed, and is insuﬃcient to ac-
count for the excess of baryons over antibaryons in the
universe [1, 2].

Proposed extensions to the Standard Model contain
new sources of CP violation [2] from which observable
electron (and other) EDMs can be generated [3, 4, 5]. No
observable Standard Model EDM eﬀects being predicted,
the mere observation of an EDM would be proof of new
physics [6].

New electron EDM experiments are useful because
there is no agreement on how non-Standard Model CP
violation would manifest and because recent theory pre-
dicts electron EDMs [7, 8, 9] just below the present exper-
imental limit. Furthermore, it appears feasible to reach
an electron EDM sensitivity of 2×10−50 C-m (1.3×10−29
e-cm), about two orders of magnitude below recent ex-
periments [10, 11, 12, 13], using a cold-atom fountain
experiment.

Laboratory electron EDM experiments search for a dif-
ference in interaction energy between an electron aligned
and anti-aligned with an external electric ﬁeld. High
atomic number paramagnetic atoms and molecules pro-
vide test systems of zero net charge and enhance the
sensitivity to an electron EDM. The calculated enhance-
ment factor R for the cesium ground state is 114 ± 15
[14, 15]. Because the interpretation of the EDM mea-
surement does not depend on subtracting out Standard
Model eﬀects, the error in the enhancement factor does
not need to be small.

A cesium electron-EDM experiment detects the EDM
as a small shift in the energy between hyperﬁne mF lev-
els, synchronous with an electric ﬁeld reversal. System-
atic eﬀects can also produce small shifts between mF
levels that are synchronous with an electric ﬁeld reversal
and must be suppressed. The predominant systematic

FIG. 1: Electric ﬁeld quantized energy levels of the F =
4 hyperﬁne level of ground-state cesium, for small residual
and motional magnetic ﬁelds (from Eq. 2). Each column
of numbers represents diﬀerent experimental conditions. The
conditions in the demonstration experiment are represented
by the rightmost column and include a motional magnetic
ﬁeld of 200 pT.

eﬀect comes from the motional magnetic ﬁeld Bmot (S.I.
units):

Bmot = vE/c2

(1)

seen by a neutral atom moving with velocity v through
an electric ﬁeld E, where c is the speed of light and where
the velocity taken to be perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld.
When a magnetic ﬁeld B0 such as that used to lift
the degeneracy between mF levels, is present, misalign-
ment between E and B0 causes a component of Bmot
to lie along B0. The total magnetic ﬁeld then changes
synchronously with the reversal of E and, through the
atom’s magnetic moment, mimics an EDM [16].

A fountain EDM experiment can use two eﬀective
methods to suppress such motional magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects:
atom-by-atom cancellation of the beam velocity due to
the rise and fall of the atoms under gravity and electric-
ﬁeld quantization [17] where, with narrow linewidth and

(almost) no magnetic ﬁeld, the electric ﬁeld lifts the de-
generacy of levels with diﬀerent |mF | (Fig. 1).

With electric ﬁeld quantization, energy shifts due to
the motional magnetic ﬁeld are absent to lowest order.
For F = 4 and mF 6= 1 , the energy W (mF ) of the mF
sublevels in strong electric- and weak magnetic ﬁelds, and
with the quantization axis deﬁned by the electric ﬁeld, is
given by:

where Bmot is given by Eq. 1 and where B⊥res is taken
to be parallel to Bmot. This term is odd in E (through
Bmot) and odd in mF (through K2). However, it can be
made very small when E and mF are large and v, B⊥res,
and B|| are small.

To test the feasibility of using electric-ﬁeld quantiza-
tion in a fountain EDM experiment and to test state
preparation and analysis methods, an existing cesium
fountain apparatus [20] was modiﬁed by adding mag-
netic ﬁeld coils (for nulling residual magnetic ﬁelds and
inducing transitions between mF states), and magnetic
shielding with separate coils for demagnetizing.

Even without electric-ﬁeld quantization, the rise and
fall of atoms in a fountain results in an atom-by-atom
velocity cancellation that suppresses motional magnetic
ﬁeld eﬀects to where they would be diﬃcult to observe.
To magnify motional magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects and to test
electric-ﬁeld quantization more rigorously, the average
beam velocity was set to about 3 m/s by increasing the
launch velocity so that the upward traveling atoms did
not turn around inside the electric ﬁeld plates, but in-
stead exited and were detected above the electric ﬁeld
plates.

2

After launching from the fountain’s magneto-optic trap
and entering a magnetically shielded and nulled region
around the electric ﬁeld plates, the cesium atoms were op-
tically pumped into either the mF = +4 or -4 state with
circularly polarized light. After the interaction region,
the atoms were analyzed to separate those that made a
transition out of the mF = 4 (−4) state from those that
remained.

The state analysis used linearly polarized light to ex-
cite all but the mF = ±4 state to the 62P3/2, F = 3
level which subsequently decays 75% of the time to the
ground F = 3 hyperﬁne level. The remaining 25 % of
the time an atom returns to the ground F = 4 level to be
excited again. After many cycles, the population in the
mF = ±4 states is the sum of their original populations,
plus about 20% of the population originally in mF = ±3
states, plus a smaller percentage of atoms originally in
mF = ±2 states.

The atoms that remained in the mF = ±4 states were
then counted by exciting the 852 nm cycling transition
62S1/2, F = 4 → 62P3/2, F = 5 and collecting the ﬂu-
orescence radiation into a photomultiplier. The signal
intensity was normalized to the number of atoms present
by pumping those atoms now in the F = 3 level back into
the F = 4 level and again detecting ﬂuorescence from the
cycling transition.

The entire interaction region was nulled to ≤ 200 pT
in each orthogonal direction. The atoms were state pre-
pared and analyzed in this region but outside the electric
ﬁeld. The residual magnetic ﬁelds were mapped in 3 di-
rections at points along the beam using the rising cesium
atoms as a magnetometer (Eq. 2).

The nulling of the residual magnetic ﬁelds, averaged
over the whole interaction region, was initially limited to
≈ 200 pT because holes in the magnetic shields (used for
access to windows and high-voltage feedthroughs) caused
local magnetic ﬁeld maxima of about 3 nT. Based upon
the measured magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle, waveform generators
were then programmed to deliver time-varying currents
to the nulling coils so as to null the local ﬁeld around the
atom packet. This local null followed the atoms as they
traveld through the interaction region. The mixing of the
mF states by the residual magnetic ﬁelds was noticeable
but small.

Transitions out of the mF = 4 (-4) state were induced
by a sequence of two 5 ms-long square magnetic pulses
(“mixing” pulses) along the direction of motion of the
atoms: the ﬁrst applied before the atoms entered the
electric ﬁeld and the second after the atoms left the elec-
tric ﬁeld. After the atoms exit the electric ﬁeld, but
before the second mixing pulse, a 10 ms-long magnetic
ﬁeld pulse ( “shifting” pulse), is applied parallel to the
electric ﬁeld (Fig. 2). By scanning the amplitude of the
shifting pulse, resonance patterns such as the one shown
in Fig. 3 are generated.

FIG. 3: The mF = ±4 population as a function of the ampli-
tude of the shifting pulse. A value of 2V corresponds to 100
pT, and an electron EDM (or systematic error) of 4 × 10−43
C-m (2.5 × 10−22 e-cm) would produce a resonance shift of
about 0.1 V. About 1000 atoms per launch were detected.
Shown are the eﬀect on the resonance position and shape of
(a) a reversal of the electric ﬁeld, (b) a reversal of the initial
state mF , and (c) a change in polarity of the mixing pulse.
For reference, the broken line shows a common condition of
E, mF , and the polarity of the mixing pulse.

weak magnetic ﬁeld is applied during the entire time the
atoms are in the interaction region in lieu of the shifting
pulse. The resulting transition amplitude as a function
of magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 4. The ≈ 5 Hz width
of the resonances is set by the 90 ms transit time of the
atoms between mixing pulses.

In this demonstration experiment, the electric ﬁeld was
set to ±6 MV/m. Resonance shapes were measured:
for the two electric ﬁeld polarities, for the initial states
mF = 4 and mF = −4, and for the two polarities of the
mixing pulse - a total of eight combinations. Reversing
the electric ﬁeld cancels out the energy shifts, such as the
tensor Stark shift that are even in the electric ﬁeld. Re-
versing the polarization subtracts terms such as K1 that
are even in mF . Reversing the mixing pulses subtracts
out distortion eﬀects to lowest order.

the amplitude of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld applied in lieu of the
shifting pulse. The loss of contrast near -0.7 nT is consistent
with a 300 nT remnant magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the
electric ﬁeld.

The line shapes in Fig. 3 are not simple sinusoids be-
cause the cesium ground F = 4 states contains nine lev-
els that are coupled by the mixing pulses. An analysis
of the lineshapes and their distortions will be presented
in a future paper. However because of the distortions, it
was important to map out the entire resonance shape as
shown in Fig. 3. To measure energy shifts between the
mF levels, a basic analysis of the data that does not fully
treat distortion eﬀects was performed.

Mapping each set of eight centroids took 40 minutes
leaving the measurement vulnerable to drifts in the mag-
netic ﬁelds that would otherwise be cancelled by rapid
electric ﬁeld reversals. With better magnetic nulling and
with the improvements discussed below, future experi-
ments should be able to detect shifts in the resonances
by monitoring only a few high-slope points.

Eighteen sets of scans were taken, each set with the
eight combinations of reversals. Our centroid analysis
obtains an EDM of −0.7 ± 2.2 × 10−43 C-m (−0.5 ± 1.4 ×
10−22 e-cm) where the value in parenthesis is the statis-
tical uncertainty at the 1σ level.

We estimate the motional systematic error by consid-
ering only the |mF | = 4 and 3 states. For E = ±6MV/m,
v = 3 m/s, and B|| = B⊥res = 200 pT, the systematic
(Eq.’s 1 - 4) is 3 × 10−45 C-m (2 × 10−24 e-cm) and is not
a factor in our demonstration experiment.

In a fountain experiment with E = 13.5 MV/m, where
a rise and subsequent fall of atoms reduces the time-
averaged average velocity to ≤ 3 mm/s, and where more
complete magnetic shielding (no holes) reduces the resid-
ual magnetic ﬁelds to 20 pT, the systematic would drop
to 1.2×10−51 C-m (7×10−31 e-cm), far below the current
experimental limit.

To reach an electron EDM sensitivity of 2 × 10−50 C-m
(1.3 × 10−29 e-cm), it is preferable to use a stronger elec-
tric ﬁeld (13.5 MV/m) and a seven-quantum transition
mF = ±4 ↔ mF = ∓3. This transition is more sensitive
to the EDM (Eq. 2) because of the larger change in mF
but requires a more complicated version of the mixing

pulses.

An electron EDM sensitivity of 2 × 10−50 C-m requires
sensitivity to a shift of 8 × 10−8 Hz at the 13.5 MV/m
ﬁeld. With a transit-time limited linewidth of 1 Hz and
an average ﬂux of 5 × 108 s−1 atoms detected, the count-
ing time needed to reach this statistical precision using
a seven-quanta transition would require about 90 hours.
Measurements to bound systematic errors would require
additional time.

Fluxes of > 1×109 cesium atoms/s have been launched
and cooled to 1.5 µK or lower [21, 22]. To have all or most
of these atoms return, it is not suﬃcient that the atoms
be cold and the electric-ﬁeld plate gap be large. It is also
necessary to focus the atoms to counter the defocusing
eﬀect of the electric-ﬁeld gradient at the entrance of the
electric-ﬁeld plates [23, 24]. An electrostatic lens triplet,
designed from ﬁrst principles, has been successfully op-
erated in the same fountain apparatus [24]. Simulations
[25] show that electrostatic lensing can compensate for
the defocusing and produce a near parallel beam between
a pair of electric ﬁeld plates with a 10 mm gap and 13.5
MV/m ﬁeld. Nearly 100% of the atoms return to be de-
tected.

To reach ﬁelds of 13.5 MV/m (or higher) with a 10
mm gap, and especially to reduce magnetic Johnson noise
[26], heated glass electrodes should be used. Heated glass
electrodes have previously been built and used for polar-
izability measurements [27, 28].

In conclusion, it appears feasible to reach an electron
EDM sensitivity of 2 × 10−50 C-m using a fountain of
cold cesium atoms, seven-quanta transitions, heated glass
electrodes, and electrostatic lenses. Motional magnetic
ﬁeld eﬀects would be suppressed by the fountain geome-
try and by electric ﬁeld quantization.

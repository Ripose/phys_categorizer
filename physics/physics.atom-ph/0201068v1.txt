We report on the guiding of cold 87Rb atoms from a magneto-optical trap by a continuous light
beam over a vertical distance of 6.5 mm. For moderate laser power (<85 mW) we are able to capture
around 40% of the cold atoms. Although the guide is red-detuned, the optical scattering rate at this
detuning (≈70 GHz) is acceptably low. For lower detuning (<30 GHz) a larger fraction was guided
but radiation pressure starts to push the atoms upward, eﬀectively lowering the acceleration due to
gravity. The measured guided fraction agree well with an analytical model.

INTRODUCTION

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The development of laser cooling has stimulated a
tremendous interest in the conﬁnement and manipula-
tion of cold atoms. In this paper we discuss the use of
a guiding laser to transport cold atoms from an optical
molasses to an evanescent wave (EW) on the surface of
a prism.

In our experiments so far a cold cloud of 87Rb atoms is
collected in a vapor cell magneto-optical trap (MOT) and
dropped on an EW mirror after post-cooling in optical
molasses [1, 2, 3]. However due to the ﬁnite temperature
of the cloud, it expands ballistically during the fall, re-
sulting in a decreased density at the surface. This density
reduction of atoms falling on the EW could be counter-
acted in several ways. For example, one could focus the
atomic cloud by means of a strong pulse of magnetic ﬁeld
gradient [4], or combined magnetic and optical pulses [5].

Here we describe our method to guide the atoms by
optical light ﬁelds, conﬁning them in the transverse di-
rection. The advantage of an optical guide is that it is
a well controlled force, that can be applied very locally.
The disadvantage of this technique is that atoms poten-
tially scatter photons from the guide, which results in
heating and loss of atoms. To overcome this problem of
scattering, some groups have used blue-detuned hollow
beams [6, 7], in which the atoms spend most of their
time in the dark inner region of the guide. Such hollow
beams cause a low optical scattering rate and can even
cool the atoms during reﬂections at the wall [8].

In this paper we investigate the simplest possible op-
tical guide: a red-detuned Gaussian laser beam of mod-
erate power. The atoms act as high-ﬁeld seekers and are
pulled toward the center of the guiding-beam [9]. There-
fore, the photon scattering rate will be higher than in a
hollow guide. However, a Gaussian beam is straightfor-
ward to implement, while the scattering rate may still
remain at an acceptable level for our purposes. We in-
vestigate the performance of the guide for various optical
parameters.

The experiment is performed in a glass vapor cell where
we create a MOT of 87Rb atoms, 6.5 mm above a BK7
glass prism. Above the prism surface we create an evanes-
cent wave (EW) that is used as an atomic mirror [1, 2].
The purpose of the guiding beam is to conﬁne the atoms
while falling towards the EW mirror.

The laser light for the guiding beam is obtained from
a home-built tapered ampliﬁer system [10]. The beam is
spatially ﬁltered by sending it through a single-mode op-
tical ﬁber and linearly polarized by a polarizing beam
splitter. The guiding laser was reﬂected at the hy-
potenuse of the prism, such that it was pointed upward
(see Fig.1). For an optimal result the guiding beam must
overlap the EW as well as the MOT . To align the beam
we mounted some of the steering mirrors on translation-
stages. This allowed us to translate the beam perpendic-
ular to its propagation direction, and to independently
adjust its angle.

We measured the beam proﬁle at various positions
along the beam line. The waist (1/e2 radius) was found
to be 0.55 mm,
located at the position of the MOT.
The divergence half-angle was 0.8 mrad. We consider
the beam waist to be constant in the 6.5 mm region be-
tween the MOT and the EW. The available power was
limited by the tapered-ampliﬁer system and its transmis-
sion through the ﬁber, which reached a maximum of 40%.
We obtained a total power of approximately 100 mW,
just before entering the vacuum cell. Because the vac-
uum cell and the prism are not anti-reﬂection coated, the
available power for guiding is 85% of the power before the
cell. Throughout this paper we quote the power of the
guiding beam inside the cell, at the position of the MOT.
We were able to switch oﬀ the beam in 100 µs by means of
a mechanical shutter, placed before the ﬁber. The guide
was red detuned with respect to the D2-line, which was
measured by a wavemeter (Burleigh, WA-1500).

The guiding beam was continuously on during the load-
ing of the MOT and during the fall of the atoms toward
the prism. For suﬃciently large detuning of the guide,

FIG. 2: a) Absorption images of falling atoms without (left

ﬁeld of view is 7.8 × 7.8 mm2. The images are taken 28 ms
after releasing the atoms from the molasses, just before they
arrive at the prism. The grey scale indicates the optical den-
sity (O.D.). The box indicates the part of the image which is
averaged, in order to analyze the data. (b) Atomic density

the result of a ﬁt, using two Gaussians, corresponding to the
guided an unguided atomic distribution. In this example the
guiding beam had a detuning of −13 × 103Γ, and a power of
82 mW.

depth can be changed by varying either the power or the
detuning of the guide. To calculate the potential depth
we take the light to be linearly polarized, and far oﬀ
resonance with respect to the D2 line. The potential is
then approximately that of a two-level atom, multiplied
by 2/3. This factor is the sum of the squares of the
Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients, summed over the excited-
state hyperﬁne levels 5P3/2, F = 0, 1, 2, 3. Note that
both hyperﬁne ground states experience approximately
the same potential. A Gaussian beam, with waist w,
power P , and detuning δ produces a potential depth at
the center of the beam of

where Γ = 2π × 6.1 MHz is the natural linewidth of the
D2 line and I0 = 1.6 mW/cm2 is the saturation intensity.
First we measured the guided fraction as a function of
guiding power, keeping the detuning ﬁxed at δ = −12 ×
103Γ, (Fig. 3). Varying the power from 0 to 85 mW
changes the potential depth at the center of the beam
from 0 to 22 µK. Increasing the power of the guiding
beam obviously results in a higher capture fraction of the
guide, since the potential becomes deeper. The largest
guiding fraction we measured was 32 % at a power of
82 mW.

We also varied the potential depth by changing the
detuning, keeping the power constant at 85 mW. The

beam is pointed upwards by reﬂecting it at the hypotenuse of
the prism. The beam must overlap both the evanescent wave

resented by the grey sphere.

we observed no eﬀect on the MOT or molasses. After
cooling in optical molasses, the atoms fall down and a
fraction of the atoms is captured in the guiding beam.
The atomic distribution is imaged on a CCD camera by
resonant absorption imaging at time tp. Just before we
probe the atoms, the guide is switched oﬀ, in order not
to blind the camera by stray light from the prism.
In
Fig. 2a we show two absorption images of the atomic
cloud, both after falling for 28 ms (just before reaching
the prism), with and without the guiding beam present.
It is clear that when the guiding beam is on, the density
is increased in the cigar-shaped area of the cloud.

III. MEASUREMENTS OF GUIDED FRACTION

In order to determine the guided fraction, we aver-
aged the atomic density distribution in the vertical di-
rection over 30 pixel rows, indicated in Fig. 2a by the
thin box. The data are well ﬁtted by a sum of two
Gaussians, corresponding to a guided and an unguided
fraction. The broad distribution represents the unguided
atoms and has a 1/e2 radius of 1.7 mm, which is the
same as the width of the atomic cloud without the guid-
ing beam present. The narrow distribution in Fig. 2b is
the density distribution of the guided atoms.
It has a
1/e2 radius of 0.45 mm, slightly smaller than the waist
of the guide. From the area of the ﬁtted distributions we
extracted the guided fraction.

We measured the fraction of atoms that were guided
for 28 ms as a function of potential depth |U0|. The

FIG. 3: (a) Guided and unguided number of atoms at 28 ms,
as a function of guiding power. The detuning and waist of
the guiding beam are kept constant: δ = −12 × 103Γ, w =
0.55 mm. (b) Fraction of guided atoms. The solid curve
is the result of a ﬁt according to Eq.7, where the MOT is
described by T = 6.1 µK and a r.m.s. width σ = 0.56 mm.

guided fraction decreased only slightly when the detuning
was varied from −4.9×103Γ (|U0| = 54 µK) to −15×103Γ
(|U0| = 18 µK), see Fig. 4. As expected the fraction
of guided atoms decreased for increasing detuning, since
this leads to decreasing |U0|. The range over which we
could vary the detuning was limited by the angle of the
grating in the master laser of the tapered ampliﬁer.

Note that for the same guide parameters (P=85 mW,
δ = −15 × 103Γ) the measured guided fraction in Fig. 3
and Fig. 4 are diﬀerent. This is because the parameters
of the molasses were diﬀerent. This is discussed in the
next section where we present the analysis of the data.

The r.m.s. width of the distribution of the guided
atoms was in all experiments around 0.25 mm at 28 ms
and hardly changed when the potential depth was varied.
For example in Fig. 3 for a power of 85 mW this width
was 0.24 mm, whereas for a power of 30 mW this width
was 0.25 mm.

Here Γ(a) is the Euler Gamma function and Γ(a, b) is the
incomplete Gamma function [11]. The guided fraction is
determined by only two dimensionless parameters: the
relative size of the guide compared to the molasses size,
w/σ, and the depth of the guide compared to the tem-
perature of the molasses, U0/kBT . The factor 4 results
from the diﬀerent deﬁnition of the waist of the guide w
(Eq.2), and the width of the molasses σ (Eq.3). As ex-
pected the guided fraction tends to 0 when either the
potential depth or the width of the guiding beam goes
to 0. The fraction increases monotonically when either
|U0| or w increases. To give an illustrative example of
the guided fraction: χ = 37 % for a guide described by
|U0| = kBT and w = 2σ.

The guiding fraction according to our model (Eq.7)
is plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 as the solid curve. This
theoretical curve is the result of a ﬁt using σ and T as
ﬁt parameters. The waist of the Gaussian potential was
set to the ﬁxed value of w = 0.55 mm. The maximum
potential depth at the center, U0, was calculated using
Eq. (1). Both experimental curves were well ﬁtted by the
theoretical function Eq.7.

In the experiment where the potential depth is varied
by varying the power of the guiding beam, the ﬁt resulted
in a molasses described by T = 6.1 ± 2.2 µK and a width
of σ = 0.56 ± 0.08 mm. The error bar represents the
95% conﬁdence interval. These values agree very well
with previous measurements of the molasses parameters.
The guiding fraction depends strongly on the size of
the molasses. To illustrate this, it is useful to analyze the
guiding fraction around the point where |U0| = 1.4kBT
(the point in Fig. 3 at the largest power). Here, the
derivative of the guiding fraction with respect to the size
∂χ/∂w∗ ≈ 0.28, where w∗ = w/σ. Thus, a 10% decrease
in molasses size would increase the guided fraction from
33% to 39%.

The experiment where the potential depth is varied by
changing the detuning resulted in a ﬁt of the molasses
parameters of T = 4.5 ± 4µK and σ = 0.52 ± 0.12 mm.
These values also agree well with previous experiments.
However, the quality of this ﬁt is less accurate, as ex-
pressed by the larger uncertainties. This is due to the
fact that the ﬁt depends on two parameters, T and σ, to
which the shape of the curve is not very sensitive. When
we compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 we observe that for the
same guide parameters, P=85 mW, δ = −15 × 103Γ, a
small increase of molasses temperature and size reduces
the guided fraction from 42% to 32%.

Knowing how to characterize the guiding fraction, we
can calculate the optimal width of the guiding beam,
given the available power. When the waist of the guide
is small, the potential depth |U0| is large, but the spatial

4

overlap is not optimal. On the other hand, when the
waist is very large, the spatial overlap with the molasses
is good, but fast atoms will escape from the low potential.
Keeping the detuning at δ = −12 × 103Γ, the optimum
waist of the guide is found to be w = 0.77 mm and a
corresponding guiding fraction χ = 47%. Our obtained
result of χ = 42% using a beam of w = 0.55 mm, implies
that only a small improvement is possible.

Our purpose of guiding the atomic cloud is to en-
hance the density of atoms arriving at the surface of
the prism, where the EW is located. For P = 85 mW
at δ = −12 × 103 Γ, the observed maximum density of
atoms inside the guide is 2 × 109 cm−3. Comparing this
to the value of a free, ballistically spreading cloud, we
see a density enhancement of 2.8. The guiding fraction
can be increased to almost 60% by raising the depth of
the guide to 55 µK. However such a high potential depth
is obtained by decreasing the detuning to −4.9 × 103 Γ
where radiation pressure by the guide starts to dominate
the eﬀect on the atoms, as will be shown in the next
section.

V. EFFECT OF PHOTON SCATTERING

Up to now the photon scattering due to the guiding
beam has not been taken into account.
In our experi-
ments we make the potential deeper by decreasing the
detuning. Whereas the potential is linear in the detun-
ing (U ∼ 1/δ), the scattering rate varies quadratically
(γ ∼ 1/δ2). For a typical power of 85 mW, and a de-
tuning of −12 × 103 Γ, the photon scattering rate at
the center of the guide reaches a value of 250 s−1. Dur-
ing 28 ms of falling, N = 7 photons are scattered on
average. This corresponds to heating of the atoms of
∆T = (N/3)Trec = 0.8 µK. This is small compared to
the initial temperature and we expect no inﬂuence on
the guiding properties. Indeed, we observed no increase
of the width of the unguided fraction when the power
was increased.

The direct result of the high scattering rate at low de-
tuning is illustrated in the absorption images in Fig. 5a.
All three images are taken at 28 ms after the molasses
phase with the guiding beam present, but with diﬀer-
ent detuning. For decreasing detuning, the scattering
rate increases and radiation-pressure pushes the atoms
upward, along the direction of the guiding beam. This
results in an apparent gravity less than g = 9.81 m/s2.
For a detuning δ = −4.9 × 103Γ, the radiation pressure
is such that the guided atoms have fallen 1.8 mm instead
of 3.8 mm for free falling atoms, due to the acceleration
of only 4.5 m/s2.

We measured the atomic density proﬁles between
10 ms and 36 ms for diﬀerent values of the detuning
ranging from −4.8 × 103Γ to −1.2 × 104Γ, keeping the
power at 85 mW. For each series we determined the ver-
tical acceleration of the guided fraction which is plotted
in Fig. 5b. The error bars of the experimental data are

For values above |δ| = 12 × 103Γ, we observed hardly
any inﬂuence of radiation pressure by the guiding beam.
For such a large detuning, the atoms scatter fewer than
5 photons during their fall, and the guiding fraction is
around 42%. For lower detuning the atoms are pushed
upward, resulting in a delayed arrival time at the prism
surface due to radiation pressure. The increasing num-
ber of scattered photons results in heating of the atomic
cloud, visible as the elongation of the atomic cloud in the
vertical direction. For the lowest detuning, the width of
the cloud is almost 30% larger compared to free falling
atoms. During the time the atoms were guided they have
scattered on average 25 photons, resulting in a tempera-
ture increase of 3 µK.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

FIG. 5: a) The atomic density proﬁle after 28 ms of guiding,
for diﬀerent detuning of the guiding beam. In each experiment
the power was 85 mW. b) Measured acceleration of the guided
fraction. For low detuning of the guide, the atoms are pushed
upwards by radiation pressure.

mainly due to the fact that the exact initial position of
the molasses is uncertain. This location is ﬁtted to be
0.63 mm outside the ﬁeld of view of the image. At low
detuning, the large errors are the consequence of the fact
that a large fraction of the guided cloud is outside the
ﬁeld of view.

The solid curve in Fig. 5b represents the calculated
value of the acceleration of the atoms in the guiding po-
tential. To obtain this curve, we calculated the exact
dipole-potential and the maximum scattering rate at the
center of the trap, γ0. The average scattering rate, ¯γ is
less than this maximum value because the atoms oscillate
in the potential. We calculated the classical trajectories
for 1000 atoms moving in the dipole potential and time-
averaged the intensity experienced by the atoms. In our
case the guide has a Gaussian shape, and under the ex-
perimental conditions (T=5 µK) we obtain an average
scattering rate ¯γ ≈ 0.6 γ0. This ratio ¯γ/γ0 ≈ 0.6 is con-
stant to within 5% for the potential range of our experi-
ments. The measured apparent acceleration corresponds
well with the theoretical value.

We showed the guiding of atoms from optical molasses
by a continuous light beam for 28 ms. For a total power of
85 mW and detuning larger than |δ| = 12×103Γ, we guide
42 % of the atoms. Although the guide is red-detuned,
the optical scattering rate at this detuning is acceptably
low. For lower detuning a larger fraction was guided but
radiation pressure starts to push the atoms upward, re-
sulting in an acceleration less than gravity. The results
of the measured guided fraction corresponded well with
an analytical model. The guiding fraction depends only
on two dimensionless parameters: the ratio of the widths
of the guide and the molasses, and the ratio of the guide
depth and molasses temperature. Using this model we
were able to ﬁt the size and the temperature of the mo-
lasses, which agrees with previous measurements of these
molasses parameters. For a detuning of δ = −12 × 103Γ,
the density enhancement after 28 ms is 2.8, compared
with ballistically spreading atoms.

We discuss a method of solving the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation for atoms with two active
electrons in a strong laser ﬁeld, which we used in a previous paper [ A. Scrinzi and B. Piraux,
Phys. Rev. A 56, R13 (1997) ] to calculate ionization, double excitation and harmonic generation
in Helium by short laser pulses. The method employs complex scaling and an expansion in an
explicitly correlated basis. Convergence of the calculations is documented and error estimates are
provided. The results for Helium at peak intensities up to 1015W/cm2 and wave length 248 nm are
accurate to at least 10 %. Similarly accurate calculations are presented for electron detachment and
double excitation of the negative hydrogen ion.

I. INTRODUCTION

Several programs are being pursued that aim at the
description of three–dimensional two– or multi-electron
atoms in strong laser ﬁelds [1–4]. The common moti-
vation for these eﬀorts is to obtain quantitative results
for excitation, ionization, and generation of harmonics
by laser pulses at intensities, where more than one elec-
tron participates in the process. The various approaches
emphasize diﬀerent aspects of the problem.

The ﬁrst fully correlated three–dimensional calcula-
tions for two–electron atoms in non–perturbative laser
ﬁelds were made for constant laser intensity by the R–
matrix Floquet method [1]. Results have been published
on H − and He [5] and M g [6]. The advantage of the
method is that it can be applied to multi–electron atoms,
where existing atomic structure programs can be used.
At large intensities, many angular momenta and Floquet
blocks are required and very large systems of equations
have to be solved. Recently an adaptation of the R–
matrix method to solve the time–dependent Schr¨odinger
equation has been proposed [2], which maintains the ap-
plicability to general atoms, but may be less plagued by
expansion size problems.

The approach of Ref. [3] puts a strong emphasis on
two–electron correlation in He–like atoms at the expense
of abandoning the realistic description of atomic struc-
ture. The method solves the time–dependent Schr¨odinger
equation on a grid for the radial electron coordinates and
with an expansion in single particle spherical harmonics
for the angular degrees of freedom. By visualization of
the wave function, in particular the process of direct dou-
ble ionization could be studied. The implementation is
adjusted to a massively parallel computer, but still the
grid size and the length of the multipole expansion of the
inter–electron potential is limited by computer resources.
The method of Ref. [4] describes a two–electron wave
function by an expansion in numerical single–electron
wave functions that are calculated in a ﬁnite box. This
provides a realistic representation of atomic structure and
allows to adjust the wave function to the parameter range

to be investigated. For example, when photoelectron
spectra are to be extracted, continuous wave functions
can be densely placed in range of electron energies of
interest. Results have been published on M g [7].

Here we present in detail the method employed for the
calculation of excitation, ionization, and harmonic gen-
eration in He published in a previous paper [8]. Our
purpose is to provide converged ab initio calculations for
realistic laser parameters with special emphasis on elec-
tron correlation. We use an expansion in explicitly cor-
related two–electron basis functions and complex scaling
[9]. The range of application is similar to that of Ref. [4].
The most important diﬀerence is our use of an explicitly
correlated basis, which gives a very accurate description
of atomic structure including doubly excited states with
a relatively short expansion. The second crucial ingredi-
ent of our method is complex scaling which, as we will
show, gives a simple implementation of strictly outgoing
wave boundary conditions by an L2 method. The penalty
of the method is the loss of a direct physical interpreta-
tion of the continuous spectrum of the complex scaled
operator. While this may not be a fundamental limita-
tion of the complex scaling method, it does at present
limit our results to total ionization, double excitation,
and harmonic generation.

Compared to Ref. [8] we extend the calculations for
Helium to higher laser intensities up to 1015W/cm2 at the
laser wave length of 248 nm. The foundation of the error
estimates given in Ref. [8] is presented and discussed in
detail. By improvements of the basis the accuracy of the
harmonic spectra calculation could be enhanced to about
10%. We supplement the results by laser detachment and
double excitation of H −.

Z = 2 for Helium and Z = 1 for the negative hydrogen
ion. Atomic units are used unless stated otherwise.

The vector potential of a linearly polarized laser pulse

is given by

~A(t) = h(t) sin(ωt) (0, 0, A0) ,

where we employed cos2 and Gaussian shaped envelopes

hcos2(t) = [cos(πt/T )]2
hGauss(t) = exp[

(2t/T )2]

−

with the pulse duration T .

The calculations were made in velocity gauge, since
we found much better convergence than in length gauge,
which is in agreement with previous experience and with
theoretical arguments [10]. A calculation at intensity
1014W/cm2 and frequencies of ω = 0.4 and 0.6 was re-
peated in length gauge and gave the same results for
ionization and single excitation. Results for double exci-
tation could not be converged in length gauge.

Eq. (1) is a 6 + 1–dimensional equation, which can be
reduced to 5 + 1 dimensions because of cylindrical sym-
metry, when the laser is linearly polarized. Due to the
high dimensionality only a very limited range of the phase
space can be numerically represented and one needs to
carefully control the restrictions imposed on this space.
The restrictions consist of basis set truncation and the
boundary conditions at large distance. We ﬁrst discuss
the boundary conditions.

A. Absorption of outgoing ﬂux

Ionization means that a ﬁnite portion of the wave func-
tion moves away to arbitrarily large distances without
further contributing to the dynamics of the system. In
a ﬁnite space one needs to absorb this outgoing ﬂux at
the boundary of the space to avoid unphysical reﬂections.
Common procedures are the use of a complex potential at
large distances [11,2] or some form of mask function [3].
A more systematic control of the asymptotic boundary
conditions has been proposed in Ref. [12]. Ideally, one
admits only outgoing waves at large distances. However,
outgoing wave boundary conditions are diﬃcult to deﬁne
in the presence of a dipole ﬁeld, which ranges to arbi-
In any case, correctly imposed
trarily large distances.

outgoing wave boundary conditions are energy depen-
dent, which is, in general, quite diﬃcult to implement
computationally. An additional complication is that the
resulting Hamiltonian is non–selfadjoint (the norm of the
wave function on the ﬁnite space is not conserved) and
it has non–orthogonal eigenfunctions. This may cause
problems for computational implementations that rely
on the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of the Hamil-
tonian.

For calculations with only one active electron, which
are eﬀectively 2 + 1–dimensional, one can usually make
the space large enough such that the boundary condi-
tions are of secondary importance. In our case a more
stringent method of absorbing outgoing ﬂux is required.
Such a method is complex scaling [9,13]. It consists in
analytically continuing the Hamiltonian by multiplying
the real coordinates by a complex number

H(~r1, ~r2; t)

Hθ = H(eiθ~r1, eiθ~r2; t),

(4)

→

−

where the scaling angle θ is real and positive. For the
time–independent Schr¨odinger equation, the mathemat-
ical theory of complex scaling is well established. The
new Hamiltonian Hθ has the same bound state spec-
trum as H, while the continuous spectrum is rotated
2θ around the ionization thresholds into
by the angle
the lower half plane of complex energies. This separates
the continua starting from diﬀerent ionization thresh-
olds.
In the wedge–shaped area between the real axis
and the rotated continua doubly excited states appear as
square integrable eigenfunctions with complex eigenval-
ues, whose imaginary parts give 1/2 of the autoioniza-
tion widths. In an exact calculation, the values of bound
state and resonance energies do not depend on the scal-
ing angle θ. The method is being widely applied. For
multi-photon physics it is used to calculate ionization
rates and AC–Stark shifts of hydrogen–like systems by
the Floquet method and in time–dependent calculations
for hydrogen–like systems [14,15].

There is no complete mathematical theory for the ap-
plication of complex scaling to time dependent problems,
only partial results for the time evolution of bound and
resonance states were found [16]. In the appendix we ar-
gue that the restriction of the complex scaled Schr¨odinger
equation

i

dt

Ψθ(~r1, ~r2; t) = HθΨθ(~r1, ~r2; t)

(5)

to the space of square integrable functions is equivalent
the unscaled equation with the constraint of strictly out-
going wave boundary conditions. The outgoing wave so-
lution at the coordinates (~r1, ~r2) is obtained by evaluat-
ing Ψθ at the back–scaled arguments (e−iθ~r1, e−iθ~r2). To
establish this equivalence we need to assume far reaching
analyticity properties of the solution Ψθ(~r1, ~r2; t), which
are diﬃcult to prove in practice.

Regardless of this mathematical problem, the method
has been successfully employed in time–dependent calcu-
lations [15] and its validity could be veriﬁed numerically

[17]. For hydrogen one can approach the limit θ
0, i.e.
directly compare with the usual Schr¨odinger equation. It
was found that the projections on bound states and the
expectation value of the dipole

do not depend on the scaling angle θ. The advantage of
the complex scaled solution is that due to the absence of
reﬂections a much shorter expansion of the wave function
can be used when θ
= 0. For the two–electron system
basis size requirements exclude very small scaling angles,
but we found stable results for the excited state popula-
tions and for ~d(t) in the range of 0.12 <
0.28 (see

angular correlation, which in the usual atomic physics
basis requires a large number of combinations of single–
electron angular momenta l and L
l, is here contained
−
in the inter–electron coordinate r12.

The expansion (11) is known to be formally complete
[18] and it converges rapidly for bound states of the
three–body Coulomb system. In Ref. [19] a further signif-
icant improvement of the basis was achieved by selecting
the combination of powers by the rule

This constraint can be understood as follows: The range
of space covered by a basis function in the direction of
r1 and r2 is roughly k/αs and m/βs, respectively. When
αs
becomes large, the electrons remain
far from each other and correlation, which is mostly con-
tained in the coordinate r12, becomes small. One there-
fore needs fewer functions with r12–dependence, when
is large. The constraint leads to an important

Z 2

In Refs. [19,20] for each state of Helium two sets of
exponents were used, one describing the known asymp-
totic behavior of the bound state wave function by se-
lecting α1 = Z and β1 = √
2E and a second
one describing correlation by exponents α2 = β2, which
were optimized to obtain the best bound state energy E.
In our case we needed to describe many states, includ-
ing strongly correlated doubly excited states, within the
same basis set. Therefore we used several diﬀerent sets
of exponents for each L and l. As an example, the expo-
nents and the powers used for L = 2 in the major part
of the calculations are given in Table I. The ﬁrst group
of exponents is adjusted to describe the singly excited
states and single electron continuum of the conﬁgura-
tion type (1s, n′d), the middle group is for symmetrically
doubly excited states and higher continua of the form
(np, n′p) and the last group is for states (nd, n′s) with
single electron quantum numbers n, n′ = 1, 2, 3. The
particle–exchanged conﬁgurations are automatically in-
cluded by the exchange symmetrization of the basis func-
tions.

It is important to observe that in velocity gauge double
excitation must be included into the basis for a correct
representation of the wave function, even when no real
double excitation occurs. The reason is that the gauge
transformation

equally aﬀects both coordinates and thus introduces vir-
tual double excitation.

Our basis functions GLl(~r1, ~r2)rk

12e−αsr1−βsr2 are
strictly real, such that the phase as well as the θ–
dependence of Ψθ(~r1, ~r2; t) is entirely contained in the
expansion coeﬃcients. This means that the expansion co-
eﬃcients of our complex scaled initial state Φθ,1S(~r1, ~r2)
are dependent on θ and for each θ and a diﬀerent sys-
tem of equations with diﬀerent initial condition has to
be solved.

We can interpret the same fact in terms of the back–
scaled solution Ψθ(e−iθ~r1, e−iθ~r2; t), which approximates
the solution of the normal Schr¨odinger equation with
outgoing–wave boundary conditions. The expansion
functions for the outgoing–wave solution are then

the deﬁnition of the D–functions is not symmetric un-
der exchange of ~a and ~b. In order to implement electron
exchange symmetry, one can for example use the Jacobi
coordinates

~a = ~r1 + ~r2
~b = ~r1 −
~r2
as the body–ﬁxed vectors. With this choice, the sub-
scripts of DL
mn refer to collective rotations of the elec-
trons. This is desirable for some highly correlated states,
like the Wannier states [24]. In the unsymmetrically ex-
cited states that dominate the wave function of an atom
excited by a laser pulse, one electron carries the major
part of angular momentum (except for symmetrization),
which leads to poor convergence of the D–function ex-
pansion.

Similar problems arise for an expansion with respect

to the perimetric coordinates

i.e. they strongly depend on θ. By varying θ we therefore
vary the expansion functions for the physical solution
and in this way we obtain an estimate of the basis set
truncation error with respect to the radial coordinates
r1, r2 and r12.

C. Alternative basis sets

The good performance of expansion (11) for He is due
to the fact that on the one hand it is very similar to
the usual atomic physics expansion in terms of prod-
ucts of single–electron orbitals, which converges well for
states, where the two electrons remain spatially sepa-
rated. On the other hand the explicit dependence on r12
allows a good description of the wave function at small
inter–electronic distances, which is particularly impor-
tant when both electrons are in the same shell, as in the
ground state or in symmetrically excited states.

We investigated several other expansions, which seem
oﬀer technical advantages or which are particularly suit-
able for speciﬁc states of He.

An implementation of arbitrary angular momentum
for few–body systems is given by Wigner’s D–functions
[21,22]. At high angular momenta that expansion allows
a strong reduction of the number of non–zero matrix ele-
ments in the calculation [23]. The D–functions separate
the overall rotation of the system from internal degrees of
freedom. The overall rotation is deﬁned as the rotation
between a body–ﬁxed coordinate system, determined by
two vectors ~a and ~b, and the laboratory coordinates. The
D–functions carry indices DL
mn, which designate the to-
tal angular momentum L, the quantum number m of
rotation around the lab–ﬁxed z–axis, and the quantum
number n of the rotation around ~a. Although there is
a certain freedom of choice for ~a and ~b, they cannot be
identiﬁed with the electron coordinates ˆr1 and ˆr2, since

∞

r1 −
|

r12 ≤

While the interparticle coordinates r1, r2, r12 are subject
to the triangular inequality
r1 + r2,
r2| ≤
the perimetric coordinates u, v, and w each vary inde-
pendently in [0,
). This simpliﬁes the calculation of in-
tegrals and allows to ﬁnd expansion functions, where the
operator matrices become sparse. Like with the Jacobi
coordinates, the unsymmetrically excited states, where
the two electrons move largely independently, are not ef-
ﬁciently described by such an expansion, since u, v, and
w each contain both coordinates r1 and r2. It also ap-
pears diﬃcult to ﬁnd a constraint like (13) to cut down
on the basis size.

Finally, we explored an expansion with respect to the
ˆr2. This is very sim-
coordinates r1, r2, and cos θ12 := ˆr1 ·
ilar to an expansion in single electron orbitals. The main
advantage is that the calculation of matrix elements be-
comes simple. However, the expansion length is generally
larger than with the explicitly correlated basis and bound
state accuracies beyond 10−4 a.u. become extremely hard
to achieve [23].

D. Numerics and computation

The expansion (11) is notoriously numerically diﬃcult.

The main reason is that the metrical matrix

(15)

use of several diﬀerent sets of exponents αs, βs for the
same L, which makes the basis formally overcomplete.
We were able to control these problems by performing
accurate integrations, by appropriately normalizing the
basis, and by removing near singular values from the met-
rical matrix. Still, at high angular momenta we needed
32 decimal digits) ac-
to resort to Fortran REAL*16 (
curacy in the calculation of the matrix elements.
We ﬁrst express the angular factors in the form

≈

G(~r1, ~r2) =

gjrkj

1 rmj

2 rnj

12 (cos θ1)λj (cos θ2)µj ,

(17)

Xj

where cos θi is the cosine of ~ri with the z–axis. The de-
termination of the expansion coeﬃcients gj is straightfor-
ward but a little cumbersome. Except for an insigniﬁcant
overall factor, the gj are rational numbers with not too
large denominators, which allowed us to compute them
numerically and ensure that they were accurate to all
digits of arithmetic precision.

For the angular integration we change variables to
cos θ1, ϕ1, cos θ12 and ϕ12, where ϕ1 is the azimuthal an-
ˆr2, and ϕ12 is the azimuthal angle
gle of ~r1, cos θ12 = ˆr1 ·
of ~r2 with respect to the axis ~r1. Integrations can then
be performed over all angular variables except for cos θ12,
r2
which is expressed as cos θ12 = (r2
12)/(2r1r2).
The remaining three–dimensional integrals have the gen-
eral form

The integrals are non–trivial, because r1, r2 and r12 are
connected by the triangular inequality. We compute
them by a strictly positive and therefore numerically sta-
ble recurrence formula [25].

Loss of accuracy is due to the expansions of GLl and
cos θ12, which at high L become very lengthy with up
5 we needed to
to several hundred terms. Beyond L
use Fortran REAL*16 arithmetic, which provided stable
results up to L

Even when no accuracy is lost in the matrix elements
the metrical matrix S has in general a very poor condition
number which quickly exceeds regular machine precision
(

≈
decimal digits). This may lead to uncontrolled errors.
We remove the problem by ﬁrst rescaling the basis such
that the diagonal elements of the metrical matrix are
1, after which the maximum size of the eigenvalues

of S was limited to <
100. We diagonalize S and remove

Since ˆH0,θ is diagonal in our basis, the solution of Eq. (23)
is trivial. Eq. (24) is solved by a seven stage 6th order
explicit Runge–Kutta method (Butcher’s method, given
in Ref. [26]), which we found to be more CPU time eﬃ-
cient than lower order methods. There were no problems
with numerical stability, as we veriﬁed by comparing with
lower order methods at a few parameter points. The time
step was automatically adapted by comparing every two
integration steps with a single double step size integra-
tion. The typical number of time steps was about 400
per optical cycle, which for our 7 stage method means
about 3000 matrix–vector multiplies per cycle. Compu-
tation times for the shorter pulses were about 1 hour on
a 500 MHz DEC/Alpha work station.

III. RESULTS

A. Bound and doubly excited states

Before we discuss the results of the time propagation,
we want to list the energies and widths of the most im-
portant bound and doubly excited states of He and H −
as obtained with the above basis. Table II compares the
values of the ﬁrst few bound state energies of He that
we obtained with the basis used in the time propaga-
tion with reference values from literature. Several of our
values are lower than the variational upper bounds from
literature, but this does not indicate greater accuracy,
since due to complex scaling our values are not upper
10−8a.u. for most energies
bounds. Our accuracy is
∼
given. The basis sizes are about 300 for each angular
momentum. The functions are counted after removal of
near–singular vectors from the basis (cf. section II D),
which is the number relevant for the time propagation.
As an example, we listed in Table I above the basis set
for L = 2. It has been shown that literature values can
be exactly reproduced with bases of size
150 that are
optimized for each state [19,20].

∼

Table III gives lowest few doubly excited states of He
from the time–propagation. The states are labelled by
the radial quantum numbers of the dominant single elec-
tron contributions n1 and n2. Accuracies are of the order
10−4 a.u. for the energies and widths. At the very small
widths the relative accuracies can become poor.

Finally Table IV summarizes the bound and doubly
excited state energies of H −. We present the energies
as they appear in the time propagation as well as values
obtained in larger bases with state speciﬁcally adapted
exponents αs and βs. Judging from the convergence be-
havior, we believe that our state–speciﬁc values are accu-
rate to all except possibly the last digit quoted. One sees
that some of them are more accurate than the literature
values quoted. A special case is the shape resonance in
L = 1 just above the H(n = 2) threshold. It requires
a minimum scaling angle of θ
0.25 to become mani-
fest as an isolated eigenvalue of the scaled Hamiltonian.
With the smaller angle used in the time propagation the
resonance state cannot be distinguished from the approx-
imate continuous states that surround it.

B. Excitation and ionization of He

tion of He by cos2–shaped pulses of duration T = 157 a.u.

and peak intensity I = 0.00423 a.u. = 2.97
Note that in Ref.
[8] the conversion to SI units was
too small by a factor of 2. The frequencies cover the
range from just above the ﬁve photon ionization thresh-
old to well above the single ionization threshold. Below
each of the thresholds one clearly distinguishes the en-
hancement of bound state excitation due to resonances.

×

−
−

The peaks below the one photon and two photon thresh-
olds are due to resonances with the lowest P –state (en-
2.12384) and the lowest excited S–state (en-
ergy =
ergy =
2.14597), respectively. The resonances below
the lower thresholds are not well separated due to the
spectral width of the pulse. The pronounced dip in the
bound state excitation at ω = 0.72 is due to a Rabi–
like oscillation. When one increases the pulse duration,
the minimum disappears completely and reappears at a
pulse duration of
270. A third minimum appears at
T = 380 (Fig. 3). The oscillation period roughly cor-
responds to the Rabi period at the given parameters.
The eﬀect strongly depends on the pulse shape. Fig. 4
compares excitation by cos2–pulses with excitation by
Gaussian pulses. The pulse energy is 0.5 a.u. for both
pulse shapes and the widths of the vector potential en-
velopes was T = 157 for the cos2–pulse and T = 92 for
the Gaussian pulse. With this choice the envelopes have
the same width at 1/e of the maximum for both pulse
shapes. One can see that the Rabi–like oscillations occur
for both shapes, but they are more pronounced with the
cos2–pulses.

∼

One can also distinguish resonant enhancement of ion-
ization, manifested by the coincidence of bound–state ex-
citation peaks with ionization peaks. Most pronounced
are the peaks at the three–photon resonance with the
lowest P –state at frequency ω = 0.26 and the two-photon
resonance with the lowest excited S–state at ω = 0.38;
another resonance with the lowest D–state is hidden in
the slope to the two–photon ionization threshold.
In
spite of the massive bound state excitation at the single–
photon resonance at ω = 0.78, weak coupling of the P –
state to the continuum leads only to a slight bump in the
ionization rate at that frequency.

The lowest frequency of 0.2 in the ﬁgures is somewhat
above the the popular frequency of 0.1837 of a 248nm
wavelength laser.
In Table V we give the ionization
yield at wave length 248 nm by a cos2 pulse of dura-
tion T = 40 cycles = 32.8 f s, which has a half width
of 20 optical cycles. The pulse parameters coincide with
the ones used in Ref. [36] for the comparison with experi-
ment. Our results are systematically lower by about 50%
compared to Ref. [36]. We estimate that our results are
converged to 10% accuracy or better (see below). Consid-
ering that we cover intensities all the way into the onset
of saturation, the agreement is nevertheless satisfactory.
Recently another calculation for the same pulse has
been published [37]. Those values sizably oscillate around
ours and also around the results of Ref. [36]. The dis-
agreement is particularly evident at the lower intensities,
It ap-
where convergence problems should be smaller.
pears therefore that calculations of Ref. [37] remain rel-
atively far from convergence. A possible reason for the
lack of convergence is the absence of doubly excited states
from the basis of Ref. [37], although the velocity gauge
used in that calculation always introduces at least virtual
doubly excited states (cf. section II B).

The experimental number given in Ref. [36] is at least

6

one order of magnitude smaller than all theoretical re-
sults and none of the calculations falls within the quite
large upper error margin of the experiment.

Ionization is predominantly a single electron eﬀect and
all observations made above are qualitatively the same in
a single electron atom. Double excitation in turn is a gen-
uine two electron eﬀect. Fig. 5 shows the population of
the lowest doubly excited states with angular momentum
L = 0, 1, 2, and 3 after passage of a cos2–shaped pulse
of duration T = 157. The narrower peaks are due to
multiphoton resonances between the ground and the re-
spective doubly excited states with 2 to 6 photons. The
population of the states with even L are enhanced in the
range ω = 0.6
0.9. This enhancement is almost exactly
proportional to the 1P o bound state population and the
ratio between the populations was found to be propor-
tional to the laser intensity. We therefore interpret it as
a far oﬀ–resonant single photon transition from the P
to the S and D states brought about by the large band
width of the pulse. As with the Rabi oscillation of sin-
gle excitation, the pulse shape is quite important, since
with Gaussian pulses the phenomenon nearly disappears.
Similarly, longer pulse duration suppresses the eﬀect.

C. Excitation and electron detachment from H

−

×

×

×

The binding energy of the only bound state of H − is
0.02775 a.u.. Therefore much lower laser intensities and
frequencies lead to total electron detachment from H −.
Fig. 6 shows the photodetachment at a laser frequency
1011W/cm2 and
of ω = 0.03 for intensities between 1
1011W/cm2 the single
1011W/cm2. At about 2
8
photon ionization threshold rises above ω = 0.03 due to
the AC Stark shift and roughly in the same intensity re-
gion two photon ionization becomes dominant [5]. In our
time–dependent calculations we can distinguish a bend
in the detachment yield, which moves towards expected
1011W/cm2 with increasing pulse dura-
intensity of 2
tion. The dashed lines are obtained by integrating the
intensity dependent detachment rates Γ(I) from Ref. [5]
with the pulse shapes used in our calculations. Satura-
tion eﬀects in the ﬁnal detachment yield Y (t =
) are
included according to the equation

As the instantaneous intensity we deﬁned

I(t) := [E0h(t)]2/2,

E0 = ωA0.

(26)

This deﬁnition neglects terms with the time–derivative of
the envelope, whose contributions do not visibly change
the comparison. The agreement for the two longer pulses
is quite good, except that the bend in the yield is some-
what more pronounced for the integrated rates. With
the shorter pulses the integrated rate underestimates the

true detachment. Assuming the applicability of the rate
concept also at the short pulses, the spectral width of the
pulse could be suﬃcient to explain the higher yield: with
a broad pulse the closure of the single photon ionization
channel is moved to higher intensities, thus eﬀectively en-
hancing the yield. For a quantiﬁcation of this hypothesis
rates Γ(I) for frequencies other than ω = 0.03 would be
required.

For the double excitation of H − one needs frequen-
cies in the visible to low UV. Fig. 7 shows the excitation
of the relatively long–lived lowest autoionizing P state
around the resonant frequency of ω = 0.134 and intensity
1013W/cm2. The resonance is shifted from its ﬁeld–free
position by about 0.001 for the 10 cycle pulses. Longer
pulses of 20 cycles have a larger shift of
0.002. In the
limit of a constant laser ﬁeld an AC–Stark shift of the
ground state by
0.005 is expected by perturbatively
∼
extrapolating the data from Ref. [5]

D. Harmonic generation

By Eq. (6) we calculate the expectation value of the
dipole ~d(t) as a function of time, from which we obtain
the acceleration of the dipole by numerical diﬀerentia-
tion. It would be more desirable to directly calculate the
¨~d(t),
expectation values of the acceleration of the dipole
but unfortunately in the matrix elements of that operator
integrals of the form (18) with negative powers of r1 or
r2 arise, which can only be calculated with considerable
extra numerical eﬀort (cf. [25]).

The expectation values ~d(t) are sensitive to the wave
function at larger distances. To obtain accurate results
we therefore added extra basis functions with smaller ex-
ponents to cover a longer range in r1 and r2. By this
enlargement of the basis we were able to obtain satis-
factory accuracies of <
10% up to the 5th harmonic for
∼
frequencies in the range 0.34 to 0.42 a.u. and intensity
1014W/cm2. The frequencies include a strong
I = 2
resonance with the lowest excited S–state that greatly en-
hances harmonic generation and leads to the dominance
of the 3rd harmonic over the 1st. Figure 8 summarizes
the results obtained with a pulse duration of 40 optical
cycles. Harmonics up to order 7 can be distinguished and
the resonant enhancement at ω = 0.38 is manifest. For
reference we include Table VI with the peak heights.

×

E. Accuracy of the results

The limited expansion length for the wave function in-
troduces the dominant error into our calculations. Now
we study the eﬀect of the truncations with respect to
total angular momentum and radial basis functions.

Fig. 9 compares the results of calculations with Lmax =
1014W/cm2 and fre-
5, 6, and 7 at peak intensity 2.97
quencies between 0.2 and 0.4. Only at the lowest frequen-

×

7

cies there is a distinguishable eﬀect on ionization with
a relative diﬀerence between the calculations of <
1%.
∼
Double excitation is more sensitive to angular momentum
truncation, since it is a much higher order process, but
still the relative error rises to only about 10%. Assum-
ing exponential convergence, we can conclude that with
Lmax also for double excitation the error due to angular
momentum truncation is <
1% at the given parameters.
∼
Convergence of the expansion in the internal coordi-
nates r1, r2, r12 is more diﬃcult to investigate, since the
basis rapidly grows when one increases the admissible
powers of r1, r2, r12. Complex scaling provides an indi-
rect estimate of the accuracy of the internal expansion.
For an inﬁnite basis, the results are independent of θ.
Any dependence on θ must therefore be ascribed to the
basis truncation. In practice, there is only a limited range
of θ where the results vary little with θ. When θ is too
small, the outgoing waves are only weakly damped and
one needs to describe a long oscillatory tail in the wave
function, for which an L2–expansion converges slowly.
When on the other hand θ is too large the complex scaled
bound state wave functions have increasingly oscillatory
character, which again is not well reproduced by the ﬁ-
nite basis (cf. appendix). Fig. 10 shows ionization and
double excitation obtained with diﬀerent scaling angles
at laser frequency 0.39 a.u.. One distinguishes a range of
θ where the results are quite stable. The variation inside
this range is of the same size as the variation when we
2,
increase the number of basis functions by a factor
which supports our use of the variation with θ for an
accuracy estimate. For the given parameters ionization
varies less than 0.2%. The accuracies for double excita-
tion are only slightly lower.

∼

At frequency ω = 0.3 the variation of ionization still re-
mains within the 1% range, but double excitation varies
by about 10%, which indicates that we approach the lim-
its of numerically reliable results for multiphoton double
excitation.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The method introduced in this paper allows the nu-
merical integration of the complete Schr¨odinger equation
of a two–electron atom in a strong laser pulse with re-
alistic frequency, intensity, and duration. This has been
demonstrated on the systems of Helium and H − with fre-
quencies ranging from infrared to ultraviolet, intensities
up to 1015W/cm2 and pulses as long as 160 f s.

The ﬁrst important constituent of our method is an
explicitly correlated basis set expansion, which allows to
reproduce the atomic structure to essentially any desired
accuracy at moderate expansion length. This includes
positions and widths of doubly excited states, where we
obtain accuracies that rival and in some cases exceed lit-
erature values.

The second ingredient of our method, complex scaling,

was formally introduced as a method of imposing strictly
outgoing boundary conditions. We cannot at present give
a mathematically rigorous theory for the use of complex
scaling in a time–dependent calculation, but we provide
heuristic arguments and numerical evidence that it in-
deed is equivalent to the regular Schr¨odinger equation
with strictly outgoing boundary conditions. The techni-
cal advantage of complex scaling is that the expansion
length remains short.

Convergence was investigated for the whole range of
parameters and indicates accuracies between fractions of
a percent at higher laser frequencies and at least 10% for
the majority of the data. Only at the seventh harmonic
peak in our example and for double excitation at lowest
laser frequencies accuracies remain unsatisfactory.

∼

The numerically most challenging combination of pa-
rameters was used for Helium exposed to pulses of du-
ration
32 f s at the wave length of 248 nm and peak
intensities up to 1015W/cm2, where we reach an accu-
racy of the ionization yield of about 10%. A previous
calculation for the same pulses [36] qualitatively agrees
with ours but exceeds our result by about 50% at the
highest intensity. A more recent calculation [37] deviates
more strongly also at the lower intensities.

Another comparison with existing theoretical work
could be performed with a Floquet calculation for the
electron detachment from H −. Quite satisfactory agree-
ment was found for pulses of at least 16 optical cycles.
Shorter pulses may not be expected to compare well with
a Floquet calculation for constant intensity.

We believe that our results should serve as a bench-
mark for future calculations of two–electron systems.
This refers to both, complete two–electron calculations
as well as model calculations. It may be expected that
for harmonic generation and ionization a single–electron
description will be found to be satisfactory in a range of
parameters.

If necessary, our method allows extensions in several
directions. To extend the range of accessible parameters
is predominantly a question of more computer power, al-
though also technical modiﬁcations in the calculation of
the matrix elements are required to control the loss of
accuracy. A second obvious extension is the introduc-
tion of an electronic core to model eﬀective two–electron
atoms like M g. Finally, the interpretation of the com-
plex scaled wave function adopted in this paper, which
takes the back–scaled wave function as an approxima-
tion to the regular solution with outgoing wave boundary
conditions, suggests that electron spectra can be deter-
mined. Whether this is numerically feasible and practical
remains to be investigated.

In order to relate Ψ(r, t) to the complex scaled wave
function we must assume that Ψ(r, t) and its time–
derivative dΨ(r, t)/dt are analytic functions of r for any
analytic initial state Ψ(r, t = 0). This assumption is non–
trivial: for example, it is known to be valid for the Hamil-
tonian of the ﬁeld–free hydrogen atom, while it is obvi-
ously violated for potentials that are non–diﬀerentiable
at any point other than r = 0. Under this assumption the
analytically continued wave function Ψ(ηr; t), Im(η) > 0

From that it follows that also the kernel of the time–

the two equations (A2) and (A6) describe exactly the

to the asymptotic behavior of the expansion functions
exp(ikηr) in Eq. (A6) we can distinguish k > 0
Φk(ηr)
from k < 0 by the norm: “ingoing waves” k < 0 grow
exponentially, while “outgoing waves” k > 0 become
square–integrable. Because of the exponential divergence

As initial condition for Eq. (A6) we use a ﬁeld free

tentials, which include the Coulomb potential, the bound
state functions are known to be analytic functions of r.

computation it is useful to keep in mind that, for exam-
ple, the radial ground state eigenfunction ηr exp(
ηr)
becomes increasingly oscillatory with increasing Im(η),
which is opposite to the outgoing waves, where larger
Im(η) causes stronger damping. Oscillatory functions
are generally more diﬃcult to represent numerically and
the choice of η = eiθ will depend on whether the outgoing
wave or the bound state part of Ψη are more important.

Bound state excitation for Gaussian and cos2
pulses as a function of frequency. The pulse energy is 0.5a.u.
for both shapes, the pulse widths are T = 157 for cos2 pulses
(solid line) and T = 92 for Gaussian pulses (dashed line).

FIG. 2. Excitation and ionization of He by a cos2–shaped
pulse of duration 3.8 fs and peak intensity 2.97 × 1014W/cm2

ionization plus bound state excitation. The arrows labelled
by n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicate n–photon ionization thresholds.
The dip at frequency 0.72 is due to a Rabi oscillation.

by cos2–shaped pulses with laser
frequency ω = 0.03 as a function of intensity for pulse dura-

two–photon ionization. Dashed lines: time–integrated Flo-

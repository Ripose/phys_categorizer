This artile reviews the urrent state of the art in the (cid:28)eld of old and ultraold moleules and

demonstrates that hemial reations, inelasti ollisions and dissoiation of moleules at subKelvin

temperatures an be manipulated with external eletri or magneti (cid:28)elds. The reation of ultraold

moleules may allow for spetrosopy measurements with extremely high preision and tests of

fundamental symmetries of nature, quantum omputation with moleules as qubits, and ontrolled

hemistry. The probability of hemial reations and ollisional energy transfer an be very large

at temperatures near zero Kelvin. The ollision energy of ultraold atoms and moleules is muh

smaller than perturbations due to interations with external eletri or magneti (cid:28)elds available

in the laboratory. External (cid:28)elds may therefore be used to indue dissoiation of weakly bound

moleules, stimulate forbidden eletroni transitions, suppress the e(cid:27)et of entrifugal barriers in

outgoing reation hannels or tune Feshbah resonanes that enhane hemial reativity.

INTRODUCTION

Controlling hemial reations with eletromagneti (cid:28)elds has long been a sought-after

goal of researhers. External (cid:28)eld ontrol of hemial reations will not only allow hemists

to seletively produe desired speies, but also reveal mehanisms of hemial reations, yield

information on interations determining hemial reations and eluidate the role of non-

adiabati and relativisti e(cid:27)ets in hemial dynamis. Possible appliations of ontrolled

hemistry range from quantum omputation with moleules, to fundamental tests of reation

rate theories, to studies of (cid:28)ne details of moleular struture or intermoleular interation

potentials. External (cid:28)elds may in(cid:29)uene moleular ollisions when the translational energy

of the moleules is smaller than the perturbation due to interations with external (cid:28)elds.

Moderate magneti and eletri (cid:28)elds available in the laboratory shift moleular energy

levels by up to a few Kelvin so external (cid:28)eld ontrol of moleular dynamis in the gas phase

is most easily ahieved at temperatures near or less than one Kelvin [1℄.

A variety of methods have been developed in the past seven years to reate moleules

and 1 K (old moleules) and at temperatures between 10−9

at temperatures between 10−3
and 10−3

K (ultraold moleules). The experimental tehniques for the prodution of old

and ultraold moleules have been desribed in a reent review by Doyle and oworkers [2℄.

Table 1 lists the oldest moleules produed in laboratory studies to date.

Ultraold moleules are haraterized by unusual sattering properties. The orbital angu-

lar momentum of the olliding moleules is asymptotially zero [3℄ and the ollision dynamis

is determined by Wigner's threshold laws [4℄ at suh low temperatures. Cross setions for

inelasti sattering and hemial reations rise to in(cid:28)nity as the ollision energy vanishes

so that reation rate onstants are independent of temperature and they an be quite large

in the limit of zero Kelvin. Collisions of ultraold moleules are extremely sensitive to in-

termoleular interation potentials and relative energies of the initial and (cid:28)nal sattering

states. A slight variation of the moleular struture due to an applied external (cid:28)eld may,

therefore, dramatially hange the outome of an inelasti ollision or hemial reation of

ultraold moleules.

The purpose of this artile is to review the urrent state of the art in the (cid:28)eld of ultraold

moleules and demonstrate that dynamis of ultraold moleules an be manipulated with

external eletri or magneti (cid:28)elds.

I will show that external (cid:28)eld ontrol of moleular

2

dynamis an be based on several priniples. Zeeman and Stark e(cid:27)ets may remove some of

the energetially allowed reation paths or they may open losed reation hannels, leading to

suppression or enhanement of the reation e(cid:30)ieny [5℄. External (cid:28)elds ouple the states

of di(cid:27)erent total angular momenta, so that forbidden eletroni transitions may beome

allowed in an external (cid:28)eld and the transition rate may be ontrolled by the (cid:28)eld strength

[6℄. The rate of low temperature abstration reations may be dramatially enhaned by the

presene of a resonane state near threshold [7℄. By shifting moleular energy levels with

external (cid:28)elds, it should be possible to bring an exited bound level of the reative omplex

in resonane with the ollision energy. Finally, external (cid:28)elds may in(cid:29)uene statistial

properties of ultraold moleular gases suh as di(cid:27)usion.

This introdution is followed by a brief disussion of Wigner's threshold laws and methods

for the prodution of old and ultraold moleules. A partiular aent is made on the

possibility of the reation of ultraold moleules in other than Σ-symmetry eletroni states

and magneti trapping of atoms in states of non-zero eletroni orbital angular momenta.

Quantum mehanial theory of moleular dynamis in external (cid:28)elds is outlined in the next

setion and mehanisms for external (cid:28)eld ontrol of moleular dynamis are desribed in the

(cid:28)nal setion before onlusions. In preparing this paper, I made an e(cid:27)ort to avoid overlap

with previous reent reviews [2, 8, 9℄. In partiular, the editorial review of Doyle et al. [2℄

desribed the experimental work with old and ultraold moleules so the present disussion

is primarily about reent theoretial work.

II. REACTIONS AT ZERO TEMPERATURE

Wigner [4℄ showed that elasti sattering (σel ) and reation (σr ) ross setions vary in the

limit of vanishing ollision veloity (v ) as

where l is the angular momentum for orbital motion of the olliding moleules about eah

other. Eqs. (1) and (2) are valid for systems with short-range interations. Long-range

intermoleular interations may modify the threshold laws (see, e.g., the review of Sadegh-

pour et al. [10℄). It follows from the Wigner expressions that both the elasti sattering and

hemial reations are dominated by ollisions with l = 0 at ultraold temperatures. The

elasti ross setion is thus independent of the ollision energy and the reation ross setion

is inversely proportional to the veloity, rising to in(cid:28)nity as v

0. Eq. (2) with l = 0 is

→

valid for inelasti ollisions or hemial reations providing the intermoleular interation

potential dereases with intermoleular separation R faster than 1/R2

in the long range. A

simple derivation of the expressions (1) and (2) was given by Landau and Lifshitz [11℄.

The reation rate onstant is obtained from the energy dependene of the reation ross

setion as follows

The reation rate onstant is thus independent of temperature and (cid:28)nite in the limit

0 K. Following the analysis of Landau and Lifshitz [11℄ and Mott and Massey [12℄,

→

Balakrishnan et al. [13℄ and Bohn and Julienne [14℄ showed that it is most onvenient to

express the zero temperature reation rate in terms of the imaginary part of the sattering

length related to o(cid:27)-diagonal elements of the sattering S -matrix.

Several reent alulations of ro-vibrational relaxation in atom - moleule ollisions

atom - moleule ollisions [25, 26, 27, 28℄ and reative sattering [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36℄

showed that rate onstants for inelasti energy transfer and hemial reations have signi(cid:28)-

ant magnitudes at zero Kelvin. In partiular, Balakrishnan and Dalgarno [29℄ found that

the hemial reation F + H2

→ HF + H ours very rapidly at ultraold temperatures
despite a large ativation barrier of about 1.5 kal/mol. The rate onstant for this reation

III. METHODS TO CREATE ULTRACOLD MOLECULES

An experiment on ooling atoms to ultraold temperatures inludes two stages: trapping

and evaporative ooling of trapped atoms [37℄. Atoms are preooled by laser ooling and

aptured in a magneto-optial or purely magneti trap [37, 38℄. Trapping isolates the atomi

loud from the thermal environment. The magneti trap is a superposition of magneti (cid:28)elds

that reates a minimum of the magneti (cid:28)eld potential at the enter of the experimental

ell. Magneti traps on(cid:28)ne atoms in Zeeman states with a positive gradient of energy with

respet to the (cid:28)eld strength (low-(cid:28)eld seeking states). The potential energy of atoms in

low-(cid:28)eld seeking states varies in a magneti trap as shown by the full line in Fig. 1. It is

essential for a trapping experiment that atoms remain in the low-(cid:28)eld seeking state upon

ollisions. If the orientation of atomi magneti moments with respet to the magneti (cid:28)eld

axis is hanged, the trapped atoms relax to a high-(cid:28)eld seeking state whose potential energy

varies in the trap as shown by the broken line in Fig. 1. Atoms in high-(cid:28)eld seeking states

are not trappable. The density of trapped atoms is largest near the enter of the trap,

where the translational temperature of the atomi loud is lowest. Collisional relaxation to

high-(cid:28)eld seeking states, therefore, removes the oldest atoms and leads to heating.

The evaporative ooling is a repetitive proess of driving most energeti atoms out of the

trap and re-equilibrating the kineti energy of the remaining atoms. The evaporative ooling

is an integral part of any experiment with ultraold atoms and it rests on the e(cid:30)ieny of

energy transport in elasti ollisions.

Laser ooling is appliable to a limited number of spei(cid:28) atoms. An alternative and

more general method of trapping atoms relies on bu(cid:27)er-gas loading [39℄. Hot atoms are

introdued into a ell of old bu(cid:27)er gas, usually

He, and ooled by elasti ollisions with

3

the bu(cid:27)er gas atoms. When the temperature of the atoms beomes less than 1 K, they an

be trapped in a large-gradient magneti trap. The bu(cid:27)er gas an then be pumped out and

the trapped atoms an be ooled to ultralow temperatures by evaporative ooling [40℄.

Laser ooling annot be applied to moleules (see, however, the work of Di Rosa [41℄).

A variety of alternative methods have been developed to preool and trap moleules. An

inomplete list inludes bu(cid:27)er-gas loading [42℄, Stark deeleration [9℄, skimming [43, 44℄,

mehanial slowing [45℄ and rossed-beam ollision [46℄. Trapped moleules an be evapora-

tively ooled to ultralow temperatures. In addition, ultraold moleules an be reated by

5

linking ultraold atoms together as in photoassoiation or through Feshbah resonanes (see

[2℄ and referenes therein). The photoassoiation and Feshbah resonane methods produe

ultraold moleules diretly so they do not depend on the evaporative ooling of moleules

whih may be di(cid:30)ult to implement. The review of Doyle and oworkers [2℄ presents a

more omprehensive disussion and referenes of methods for the prodution of ultraold

moleules.

The stability of moleules in a magneti trap was studied by several authors [47, 48,

49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56℄. Bohn and oworkers demonstrated that moleules with-

out eletroni orbital angular momenta (Σ-state moleules) tend to preserve the orientation

of the magneti moment in a magneti (cid:28)eld [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52℄. Krems and oworkers

showed that the Zeeman relaxation in rotationally ground-state moleules without eletroni

orbital angular momenta is mediated by oupling to rotationally exited moleular states

[53, 54, 55℄. Collisional trap loss is therefore sensitive to the rotational onstant of trapped

moleules and Krems and Dalgarno onluded that only Σ-state moleules with large ro-

tational onstants are amenable to evaporative ooling in a magneti trap [55℄. A reent

experiment of Maussang et al. on(cid:28)rmed these preditions [57℄.

The interation potential anisotropy in moleule - moleule ollisions is larger than that

in ollisions of moleules with He atoms.

It should be expeted that ollisional spin de-

polarization will be more e(cid:30)ient in moleule - moleule ollisions relevant for evaporative

ooling experiments and the possibility of bu(cid:27)er-gas loading of moleules in a magneti trap

does not guarantee the possibility of evaporative ooling of moleules. However, Krems and

Dalgarno pointed out that the mehanism of trap loss in moleule - moleule ollisions is

the same as in atom - moleule ollisions, providing weak magneti dipole interations an

be negleted [55℄. The basi result that Σ-state moleules with larger rotational onstants

will be more stable in magneti traps, therefore, applies to evaporative ooling experiments

as well. The quantitative question of whether the evaporative ooling of moleules is going

to be possible in a magneti trap remains open.

Moleules with dipole moments an potentially be trapped in eletrostati traps. How-

ever, Bohn found that ollisional relaxation of moleules from low-eletri-(cid:28)eld-seeking to

high-eletri-(cid:28)eld-seeking states preludes the eletrostati trapping [49℄. Bohn reom-

mended that magneti (cid:28)elds should be used for trapping polar paramagneti moleules.

Proposals exist [58℄ to ool moleules to extremely low temperatures by ollisions with

6

ultraold trapped alkali metal atoms (sympatheti ooling). Soldán and Hutson explored

the possibility of ooling NH moleules by ollisions with ultraold Rb atoms [59℄. They

found that ooling may be ompliated by non-adiabati dynamis involving ion-pair states

and leading to dramati enhanement of the interation strength. The authors proposed an

experiment to reate strongly bound triatomi omplexes at ultraold temperatures.

Moleular Bose-Einstein ondensates have reently been produed by oupling ultraold

atoms through magnetially tuned Feshbah resonanes [60, 61, 62℄. Partiularly suessful

were the experiments with fermioni ultraold atoms. Petrov [63℄ and Petrov et al. [64℄

showed that weakly bound moleules omposed of fermioni atoms are stable against olli-

sionally indued relaxation and trap loss due to Fermi suppression in atom - atom intera-

tions. This raised the question of whether vibrational relaxation in strongly bound dimers of

fermioni atoms would also be suppressed in ultraold ollisions. Cvita² et al. omputed the

vibrational relaxation e(cid:30)ieny in ollisions of Li with Li2 for both bosoni and fermioni

atoms [34℄. The authors found that the rate onstants for vibrational relaxation of Li2 in

the lowest three vibrationally exited levels are similar for bosoni and fermioni atoms so

the quenhing rates are not suppressed in strongly bound moleules omposed of fermioni

atoms.

Ultraold ollisions are very sensitive to intermoleular interation potentials; in par-

tiular, Soldán et al. [65℄ demonstrated that three-body non-additive fores between spin-

polarized alkali atoms are ruial for dynamis of alkali atom - alkali moleule reations.

An important question yet to be answered is whether the auray of modern quantum

hemistry methods is su(cid:30)ient for a realisti ab initio desription of moleular dynamis at

ultraold temperatures.

The emphasis of several reent experiments was on the reation of ultraold polar

moleules. The work of Bergeman et al. [66℄ on the reation of translationally, eletron-

ially, vibrationally and rotationally old RbCs moleules and the work of Wang et al. [67℄

on the photoassoiative moleule formation and trapping of KRb moleules are two most

reent examples of the progress in this diretion.

Dynamis of moleules with non-zero eletroni orbital angular momenta about the mole-

ular axis (non-Σ-state moleules) is haraterized by non-adiabati interations and it an

be manipulated with external eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds [68℄. The reation of ultraold

non-Σ-state moleules will open up possibilities for studies of non-adiabati e(cid:27)ets in hem-

7

ial reations at zero Kelvin. High preision spetrosopy measurements of non-Σ-state

moleules possible at ultraold temperatures may allow for tests of fundamental symmetries

of the nature and help in searhes for the time variation of fundamental onstants. Trap-

ping and ooling non-Σ-state moleules to ultraold temperatures thus presents a partiular

interest. Avdeenkov and Bohn [69℄ and Groenenboom [56℄ found that evaporative ooling

of non-Σ-state moleules in a magneti trap will unlikely be possible due to large ollisional

losses. Alternatively, ultraold non-Σ-state moleules an be reated by photoassoiation

of atoms with non-zero eletroni orbital angular momenta. However, all atoms ooled to

ultraold temperatures in a magneti trap so far were in eletroni S -states and the ele-

troni ground state of moleules produed by photoassoiation of S -state atoms is always

of Σ symmetry. An important question is thus (cid:16)Can atoms with non-zero eletroni orbital

angular momenta (non-S -state atoms) be magnetially trapped and evaporatively ooled to

ultraold temperatures?(cid:17)

IV. MAGNETIC TRAPPING OF NON-S -STATE ATOMS

An interation of two atoms with non-zero eletroni orbital angular momenta gives rise

to several adiabati potentials with di(cid:27)erent symmetries. For example, the interation of two

oxygen atoms in the ground

3P state is desribed by 18 interation potentials orresponding

to di(cid:27)erent spin multipliity, parity and spatial symmetry of the O2 moleular states [70℄. A
1S ) is desribed by two interation potentials of Σ and

3P ) with He(

simpler omplex of O(

Π symmetries [71℄.

form as

Krems, Groenenboom and Dalgarno [72℄ showed that the eletroni interation between

two atoms in arbitrary angular momentum states an be expressed in an e(cid:27)etive potential

Eq.

(5) an be used to de(cid:28)ne the eletroni interation anisotropy between atoms in

arbitrary eletroni states. The terms with k1 = k2 = k = 0 represent the isotropi part of

the eletroni interation that annot indue angular momentum transfer in atom - atom

ollisions. The terms with non-zero k1 or k2 and k represent the anisotropi part of the ele-

troni interation. As follows from the results of Ref. [72℄, the anisotropi oe(cid:30)ients V S

k1,k2,k

an all be expressed in terms of di(cid:27)erenes between the adiabati potentials of the diatomi

moleule. For example, the eletroni interation anisotropy in the O(

3P ) (cid:21) He omplex

is determined by the splitting of the Σ and Π interation potentials at (cid:28)nite interatomi

distanes - the result obtained muh earlier by Aquilanti and Grossi [73℄.

The stability of atoms in a magneti trap is determined by the degree of the eletroni

interation anisotropy in atomi ollisions. The non-relativisti interation of S -state atoms

is isotropi. All terms with non-zero k1 , k2 or k in Eq. (5) vanish when both interating

atoms are in states with zero eletroni orbital angular momentum. Collisional relaxation

and trap loss of S -state atoms in maximally strethed low-(cid:28)eld seeking states is determined

by the magneti dipole-dipole interation whih is very weak. Collisional relaxation and trap

loss of non-S -state atoms may, by ontrast, be indued by the anisotropy of the eletrostati

interation, i.e. by terms with non-zero k1 , k2 and k in Eq. (5).

To understand the prospets for bu(cid:27)er-gas loading and evaporative ooling of non-S -state

atoms, Krems and Dalgarno arried out rigorous quantum mehanial alulations of rate

onstants for elasti sattering and Zeeman relaxation in ollisions of oxygen atoms in the

3P state with

3

He atoms [6℄. It was found that the probability of elasti He - O(

3P ) ollisions

is only six times larger than the probability of Zeeman relaxation at the temperature 1 K

and magneti (cid:28)eld 1 Tesla. The bu(cid:27)er-gas loading and evaporative ooling experiments

are possible when the elasti sattering rate exeeds the rate for trap loss by, at least, one

thousand. The results of Krems and Dalgarno thus indiated that bu(cid:27)er-gas loading and

evaporative ooling of non-S -state atoms like oxygen would be impossible. Kokoouline et

al. [74℄ arrived at the same onlusion in their numerial study of Sr(

3P ) - Sr(

3P ) ollisions.

Hanox and oworkers [75℄ and Krems and oworkers [76℄ have reently reported a om-

bined experimental and theoretial study of the eletroni interation anisotropy in ollisions

of transition metal atoms S and Ti with

He. It was found that the interation anisotropy

3

9

in omplexes of S(

2D) and Ti(

3F ) with He is dramatially suppressed due to the presene

of paired spherially-symmetri eletrons in the outer eletroni shell of the transition metal

atoms. Non-relativisti interation potentials for omplexes of Ti and S atoms with He

were desribed in detail in Ref. [77℄. Table II presents the ratio of rate onstants for elasti

sattering and Zeeman relaxation in ollisions of oxygen in the

He

3P and

1D states with

3

3

3P ) and O(

1D) atoms

and in ollisions of the transition metal atoms with

He. While O(

tend to hange the orientation of their magneti moment in almost every other ollision,

only one in about 40000 ollisions of Ti(

He leads to angular momentum transfer

3F ) with

3

and loss of magnetially trapped Ti. Hanox et al. [78℄ have later found that the interation

anisotropy is even more suppressed in omplexes of rare-earth atoms with He and most of

the rare-earth atoms have been magnetially trapped as a result of this work.

Interations between transition metal atoms or rare-earth atoms are more omplex than

those between transition metal atoms and He. The work outlined above rules out the

possibility of evaporative ooling of main-group non-S -state atoms like oxygen or strontium

in a magneti trap, but provides only an indiation that the evaporative ooling of non-

S -state transition metal and rare-earth atoms may be possible.

It should be expeted,

however, that interations between transition metal atoms and S -state alkali metal atoms

in a magneti trap will be similar to those between transition metal atoms and He and the

results of Hanox et al. and Krems et al. suggest the possibility of sympatheti ooling of the

non-S -state atoms by ollisions with trapped alkali metal atoms to ultraold temperatures.

Ultraold non-S -state atoms may be photoassoiated with eah other or with the alkali metal

atoms to produe ultraold non-Σ-state moleules.

V. COLLISIONS OF MOLECULES IN EXTERNAL FIELDS

Following the work of Volpi and Bohn [51℄, Krems and Dalgarno [55, 79℄ presented a

quantum mehanial theory of moleular ollisions in external (cid:28)elds. External eletri and

magneti (cid:28)elds disturb the spherial symmetry of the problem and the total angular momen-

tum of the olliding moleules is not a good quantum number in the presene of an external

(cid:28)eld. The total angular momentum representation of Arthurs and Dalgarno [80℄ does not

redue the dimension of the ollision problem in an external (cid:28)eld and Krems and Dalgarno

[55, 79℄ argued that the most onvenient theory of moleular ollisions should then be based

10

on a ful ly unoupled spae-(cid:28)xed basis representation of the wave funtion. The omplexity of

the ollision theory in the fully unoupled representation does not inrease with the number

of internal degrees of freedom and the evaluation of the matrix elements of all terms in the

Hamiltonian is straightforward.

The Hamiltonian of two Σ-state moleules (A and B) with non-zero spins in an external

magneti (cid:28)eld an be generally written as

∂2
∂R2 R +
where R is the Jaobi oordinate joining the enters of mass of the olliding partiles, l is
the angular momentum desribing the rotation of the vetor R, µ is the redued mass of

HA and HB denote the Hamiltonians of the isolated moleules A and B at zero (cid:28)eld, VAB

denotes the potentials for the interation between A and B and the supersripts (cid:16)si(cid:17) and

(cid:16)sd(cid:17) distinguish the spin-independent (si) and spin-dependent (sd) terms. The terms V sd
A

and V sd

B desribe the interation with external magneti (cid:28)elds.

The total wave funtion of the olliding moleules is expanded in produts of eigenfun-

tions of l2

SA and SB are the spins of the moleules A and B, and ml , MSA and MSB are the pro jetions
of l, SA and SB on the magneti (cid:28)eld axis. The funtions φA and φB are obtained from the
eigenstate equations with the Hamiltonians H si

A and H si
B .

The matrix of the Hamiltonian (6) is not diagonal in the basis (9) in the limit R

→ ∞ and
the sattering S -matrix annot be found in this representation. An additional transformation

11

C must be introdued to form a basis in whih the Hamiltonian of the separated moleules

would be diagonal. The matrix elements of this transformation annot be found analytially,

even though the struture of the matrix C is determined by the matries Hsi

A , Hsi
B . The matrix of the the transformation C is onstruted from eigenvetors of the

and it should be reomputed at every value of the external (cid:28)eld. The eigenstates of the

CTHasC matrix labeled by the indexes α, l, ml are the sattering hannels of the olliding

moleules in the presene of the external (cid:28)eld.

The interation of the orbital angular momentum l with magneti (cid:28)elds is negleted so

both the matrix of the asymptoti Hamiltonian (10) and the C matrix are diagonal in l

and ml quantum numbers. This approximation allows us to apply the following boundary

The pro jetion of the total angular momentum of the olliding moleules on the magneti

(cid:28)eld axis (M ) remains a good quantum number in the presene of external (cid:28)elds. That is

why the oupling matrix U does not ontain ouplings between states with di(cid:27)erent values

of M and the transformation C does not mix di(cid:27)erent M -states. The equations (12) should

therefore be integrated in a yle over all possible M -values and the ollision ross setion

In some spei(cid:28) ases (for example, in the presene of strong spin-orbit interations) it

may be advantageous to ouple internal angular momenta of the moleules with moleular

spins or it may be easier to determine the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in the moleule-

(cid:28)xed oordinate frame.

VI. EXTERNAL FIELD CONTROL OF MOLECULAR DYNAMICS

The ollision energy of moleules at subKelvin temperatures is less than perturbations

due to interations of the moleules with external eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds available in

the laboratory. External (cid:28)elds may therefore be used to manipulate dynamis (hemial

reations, inelasti ollisions and dissoiation) of old and ultraold moleules.

External (cid:28)eld ontrol of moleular dynamis an be based on several di(cid:27)erent priniples.

Zeeman and Stark e(cid:27)ets may remove some of the energetially allowed reation paths or

they may open losed reation hannels, leading to suppression or enhanement of the re-

ation e(cid:30)ieny [5℄. External (cid:28)elds break the spherial symmetry of the spae and ouple

the states of di(cid:27)erent total angular momenta, so that forbidden eletroni transitions may

beome allowed in an external (cid:28)eld. The transition rate may then be ontrolled by the

(cid:28)eld strength [6℄. Some hemial reations or inelasti ollisions are signi(cid:28)antly a(cid:27)eted by

entrifugal barriers in the (cid:28)nal reation hannels. External (cid:28)elds may inrease the energy

separation between the initial and (cid:28)nal states of the reatants and produts and enhane

the reation probability to a great extent [6, 51, 81℄. External (cid:28)elds may modify intermole-

ular interation potentials and indue long-range potential minima due to avoided rossings

between di(cid:27)erent eletroni states of olliding moleules [82, 83℄. As a result, moleules may

13

form long range dimer omplexes. The binding energy of the omplexes an be ontrolled by

the strength of the external (cid:28)elds. The rate of low temperature abstration reations may be

dramatially enhaned by the presene of a resonane state near threshold [7℄. By properly

hoosing the magnitude of the external (cid:28)eld, it should be possible to bring an exited bound

level of the reation omplex in resonane with the ollision energy. This will enhane the

reation probability.

Krems showed that dissoiation of weakly bound moleules an be indued by external

magneti (cid:28)elds, if one or more produts of the dissoiation are in states with non-zero

eletroni orbital angular momenta [5℄. Figure 2 explains the idea of the magneti-(cid:28)eld

indued dissoiation. Several eletroni states orrelating with di(cid:27)erent Zeeman levels of

the dissoiation produts have the same asymptoti energy at zero magneti (cid:28)eld. Magneti

(cid:28)elds split the Zeeman energy levels and bound levels of some eletroni states may beome

embedded in the ontinuum of the other states in the presene of the (cid:28)eld. The moleules an

then dissoiate through transitions between the Zeeman levels. The Zeeman predissoiation

may be e(cid:30)ient and it an be ontrolled by the magnitude of the external (cid:28)eld. As the

magneti (cid:28)eld inreases, the number of the predissoiating bound levels inreases and the

predissoiation time dereases. Figure 3 shows the lifetime of the He-O(

3P ) van der Waals

moleule as a funtion of the magneti (cid:28)eld.

Volpi and Bohn showed that the probability of Zeeman relaxation transitions in ultraold

moleular ollisions is extremely sensitive to the magnitude of the external magneti (cid:28)eld,

espeially at low (cid:28)elds [51℄. The orbital angular momentum of the olliding moleules about

eah other is zero in ultraold ollisions so there is no entrifugal barrier in the inoming

ollision hannel. Due to onservation of the total angular momentum pro jetion, Zeeman

transitions must be aompanied by hanges of the orbital angular momentum. Non-zero

orbital angular momenta in (cid:28)nal ollision hannels lead to long-range entrifugal barriers

that suppress the inelasti ollisions at low (cid:28)elds (see Fig. 4). In the limit of zero (cid:28)eld, the

Zeeman levels are degenerate and the ross setions vary with veloity v near threshold as

v∆m

∼

for even ∆m or ∼

v∆m+1

for odd ∆m [81℄, where ∆m is the hange in the orbital

angular momentum pro jetion in the laboratory (cid:28)xed oordinate system. In the presene of

the (cid:28)eld, the Zeeman relaxation ross setions must vary as ∼

1/v aording to the Wigner

law. The energy separation between the Zeeman levels inreases with the magnitude of the

(cid:28)eld so that the entrifugal barriers annot impede the relaxation dynamis at high (cid:28)elds

14

→

(see Fig. 4). Figure 5 presents the zero temperature rate onstant for Zeeman relaxation in

ollisions of rotationally ground-state NH(

3Σ) moleules in the maximum energy spin level

with

He atoms as a funtion of the magneti (cid:28)eld.

External eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds break the spherial symmetry of the ollision prob-

lem and may ouple eletroni states otherwise unoupled [6℄. Forbidden eletroni transi-

tions may thus beome allowed in the presene of external (cid:28)elds. Figure 6 shows the energy

diagram of the arbon atom in a magneti (cid:28)eld. Krems et al. [84℄ demonstrated that the

3P1

3 P0 transition in ollisions of arbon with He atoms annot our at zero tempera-

ture due to the symmetry of the eletroni interation. The ross setion for this transition

vanishes in the limit of zero ollision veloity. External magneti (cid:28)elds ouple the

3P0 states of arbon so the ross setion for the (cid:28)ne struture relaxation varies as ∼

1/v in

the presene of a magneti (cid:28)eld. Figure 7 shows the zero temperature rate onstant for this

3P1 and

forbidden eletroni transition as a funtion of the external magneti (cid:28)eld.

Avdeenkov et al. [82, 83℄ showed that polar moleules may form long-range omplexes in

the presene of d eletri (cid:28)elds. The omplexes are bound in long-range potential wells aris-

ing due to avoided rossings of eletroni states with repulsive and attrative interations in

the long range. Eletri (cid:28)elds shift the asymptoti energy of the olliding moleules and move

the position of the avoided rossings. Thus, eletri (cid:28)elds an be used to ontrol the binding

energy of the long range omplexes and ollision properties of ultraold polar moleules. The

authors argued that the long-range (cid:28)eld-linked states may prevent moleules from approah-

ing to short intermoleular distanes where di(cid:27)erent eletroni states are strongly oupled

and inelasti relaxation and hemial reations leading to trap loss are inevitably e(cid:30)ient.

Inelasti ollisions and hemial reations an then be ativated by swithing o(cid:27) the (cid:28)eld.

Bodo et al. [7℄ omputed the rate for the F + H2

funtion of the mass of the hydrogen atoms.

→ HF + H hemial reation as a
Inreasing the mass of H2 pushes the least

bound level in the entrane reation hannel to above the dissoiation threshold and the

alulations mimi the hemial reation near a Feshbah resonane. Figure 8 shows that

the zero temperature reation rate inreases to a great extent near the resonane. If the

reatants and produts of a hemial reation are separated by an ativation energy, the

hemial reation ours at low temperature by tunneling under the potential barrier. Most

abstration hemial reations have ativation barriers and the F + H2

→ HF + H reation

is a typial example of an abstration reation with an ativation barrier. If the reatants

15

are trapped in a resonane state near the potential barrier, the ollision omplex lives longer

and the tunneling probability is enhaned. Feshbah resonanes an be indued by external

eletri or magneti (cid:28)elds. So the alulation of Bodo et al. suggests that abstration

hemial reations an be indued by tuning Feshbah resonanes with external (cid:28)elds.

Tiknor and Bohn [68℄ onsidered the e(cid:27)ets of eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds on ollisions

of OH(

2Π3/2 ) moleules. They found that inelasti relaxation of eletri-low-(cid:28)eld seeking

states an be suppressed by magneti (cid:28)elds. The authors showed that an applied magneti

(cid:28)eld may ounterat some ouplings responsible for the Stark relaxation and separate the

energies of the initial and (cid:28)nal sattering hannels. Magneti (cid:28)elds of a few thousand Gauss

were found to be su(cid:30)ient to suppress the inelasti relaxation by two orders of magnitude.

Avdeenkov and Bohn [69℄ had earlier shown that ollisionally indued inelasti relaxation of

eletrostatially trapped polar moleules is very e(cid:30)ient, espeially at high eletri (cid:28)elds.

The results of Tiknor and Bohn are, therefore, partiularly important as they suggest that

the trap loss ollisions may be mitigated by properly hosen magneti (cid:28)elds.

VII. CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS OF ULTRACOLD MOLECULES

The (cid:28)eld of old moleules is expanding very quikly. Starting from the experiment

on magneti trapping of CaH moleules [42℄, it now enompasses the work of more than 50

researh groups worldwide. The interest to old and ultraold moleules is shared by atomi,

moleular and ondensed-matter physiists, quantum optis physiists, physial hemists and

spetrosopists. Why suh an interdisiplinary interest?

High preision spetrosopy measurements possible with ultraold moleules may allow

for tests of fundamental symmetries of the nature and help in searhes for the time variation

of the fundamental onstants (see the review of Doyle et al. [2℄ and referenes therein).

Cold trapped moleules an be used in quantum omputation [85℄. Moleular Bose-Einstein

ondensation may lead to novel phenomena yet to be disovered.

Possibilities of hemial researh with old and ultraold moleules are boundless and

entiing. Partiularly appealing are the prospets to explore Bose-enhaned hemistry [86℄.

Seletivity of hemial reations and branhing ratios of photodissoiation may be greatly

enhaned in a moleular Bose-Einstein ondensate due to olletive dynamis of ondensed

moleules. Seletion rules are more strit and propensities for near-resonant energy transfer

16

in moleular ollisions or hemial reations are more pronouned at ultraold temperatures

[8℄. Collisional relaxation of ultraold moleules may, therefore, be used for the reation of

moleules with inverse rotational distributions and moleular lasers.

As desribed in this paper, inelasti ollisions, hemial reations and dissoiation of

old and ultraold moleules an be manipulated with external eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds.

External (cid:28)eld ontrol of moleular dynamis at subKelvin temperatures is an alternative to

oherent ontrol methods developed and used in various areas of hemistry [87℄. Coherent

ontrol of bimoleular proesses is ompliated by the need to entangle internal moleular

states with the enter-of-mass motion and it will be muh easier to implement oherent

ontrol shemes with stationary ultraold moleules.

External (cid:28)eld ontrol of moleular dynamis at ultraold temperatures will allow for

studies of (cid:28)ne details of moleular struture. Ultraold ollisions probe the long range

of intermoleular potentials and measurements of ultraold dynamis will provide detailed

information about weak intermoleular interation fores.

Experiments with ultraold moleules will test the appliability limits of onventional

moleular dynamis theories. For example, the Boltzmann equation may not be valid in

the ultraold temperature regime as it does not aount for quantum e(cid:27)ets in moleular

interations. New theories may need to be developed for the proper desription of moleular

dynamis at temperatures near absolute zero.

Despite the onstantly growing number of researh groups working with ultraold

moleules, the (cid:28)eld of ultraold moleules remains largely a terra inognita. Every new

disovery generates a manifold of questions.

It is safe to say that the (cid:28)eld of ultraold

moleules has already exploded but it is yet to blossom.

orrespond to di(cid:27)erent Zeeman levels of the dissoiation produts and they are asymptotially

degenerate at zero (cid:28)eld. The asymptoti energies of the eletroni states separate in the presene

of the (cid:28)eld and bound energy levels of one state may beome embedded in the ontinuum of the

other state. The moleules may then dissoiate through Zeeman transition. Adapted from Ref. [5℄.

Inoming hannels are shown by full urves, outgoing hannels (cid:21) by broken urves. An applied (cid:28)eld

separates the energies of the initial and (cid:28)nal hannels and suppresses the role of the entrifugal

Timmel, P.J. Hore, and K. MLaughlan, Mol. Phys. 100, 1181 (2002). This type of external

(cid:28)eld ontrol is based on induing interonversion between singlet and triplet states of the

reative omplexes and it should be possibile in gas phase reation dynamis as well.

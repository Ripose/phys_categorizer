(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We demonstrate detection of NMR signals using a non-cryogenic atomic magnetometer and de-
scribe several novel applications of this technique. A water free induction decay (FID) signal in a
0.5 µT ﬁeld is detected using a spin-exchange-relaxation-free K magnetometer and the possibility
of using a multi-channel magnetometer for 3-D MRI requiring only a single FID signal is described.
We also demonstrate detection of less than 1013 129Xe atoms whose NMR signal is enhanced by a
factor of 540 due to Fermi-contact interaction with K atoms. This technique allows detection of less
than 109 129Xe spins in a ﬂowing system suitable for remote NMR applications.

Nuclear magnetic resonance is a powerful technique
widely used in both basic research and medical applica-
tions. Traditionally, NMR signals from thermal nuclear
polarization are detected with an RF pick-up coil. A
high magnetic ﬁeld, usually produced by a superconduct-
ing magnet, increases the strength of the signal approx-
imately as B2 and improves the ability to resolve NMR
chemical shifts. In applications that do not require chem-
ical shift information it is possible to avoid using a large
magnetic ﬁeld by utilizing a magnetometer instead of an
inductive pick-up coil to detect the NMR signal, making
the signal strength proportional only to the ﬁrst power
of B. Detection of NMR signals in ﬁelds as low as a few
µT has been demonstrated using SQUID magnetometers
[1, 2]. It is even possible to completely eliminate the de-
pendence of the signal strength on the magnetic ﬁeld by
utilizing hyperpolarized nuclei, such as 129Xe polarized
by spin-exchange optical pumping [3] or protons polar-
ized by Spin Polarization Induced Nuclear Overhauser
Eﬀect [4]. However, NMR detection with SQUID magne-
tometers still requires a cryogenic system and precludes
many applications of NMR and MRI requiring portable,
maintenance-free systems.

In this Letter we demonstrate NMR detection using
an atomic magnetometer and describe several novel ap-
plications based on unique properties of atomic mag-
netometers. Recent advances in atomic magnetome-
try [5], in particular demonstration of a spin-exchange-
relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer [6] have allowed
alkali-metal magnetometers to exceed the sensitivity of

low-temperature SQUID detectors [7].
high sensitivity, atomic magnetometers also allow low-
cost multi-channel measurements with a high spatial res-
olution and do not require cryogenic cooling. Here we
demonstrate ﬁrst detection of NMR free induction decay
(FID) signals from a thermally polarized water sample
with an atomic magnetometer. Previous measurements
using atomic magnetometers have only detected DC mag-
netization of hyperpolarized gases [8, 9, 10]. We also de-
scribe a novel MRI method that allows reconstruction of
a 3-D image from a single FID signal in the presence of
a constant magnetic ﬁeld gradient by relying on multi-
channel magnetic ﬁeld measurements. In a separate ex-

periment, we investigate a unique method for enhancing
NMR sensitivity by allowing the nuclei to occupy the
same volume as the active atoms of the magnetometer.
In addition to reducing the distance between the nuclear
spins and the atoms measuring the magnetic ﬁeld, this
method can also enhance the NMR signal due to Fermi-
contact interaction between the alkali-metal valence elec-
tron and the nuclei spins [11, 12]. With this technique we
detect a signal from 2 × 1013 129Xe atoms with a signal-
to-noise ratio of 10 in a single shot with a bandwidth of
10 Hz. Straight-forward optimization of this technique
can achieve sensitivity of about 109 129Xe spins with-
out averaging. For comparison, detection of NMR us-
ing traditional pick-up coils is limited at a level 3 × 1012
spins even with substantial averaging [15, 16]. Detec-
tion of optically pumped Ga spins using magnetic reso-
nance force microscopy has achieved sensitivity of 7 × 108
spins [17]. Hyperpolarized 129Xe is widely used for MRI
[18], as a biosensor [19, 20], and for remote NMR detec-
tion [21]. However, measurements with human subjects
are restricted due to anesthetic properties of xenon in
high concentrations. Combining the techniques of re-
mote NMR encoding with a ﬂow-through spin-detection
system using an atomic magnetometer would allow one
to use much smaller 129Xe concentrations.

Atomic magnetometers operate by measuring the pre-
cession of electron spins in a magnetic ﬁeld, usually us-
ing an alkali metal vapor. The sensitivity of the mag-
netometer is determined by the number of atoms in the
active volume and their transverse spin relaxation time.
Atomic collisions usually limit the transverse spin relax-
ation time, particularly at high alkali-metal density. As
was ﬁrst shown in [22], the dominant relaxation mech-
anism due to spin-exchange collisions can be eliminated
by operating in a very low magnetic ﬁeld with a high
alkali-metal density. Such spin-exchange relaxation-free
(SERF) magnetometer has achieved magnetic ﬁeld sen-
sitivity of 0.5 fT/Hz1/2 using an active volume of only
0.3 cm3 [7]. The small active volume is important for
obtaining a short eﬀective distance between the magne-
tometer and the NMR sample. The magnetometer con-
sists of a glass cell containing K vapor and a high pres-
sure buﬀer gas to slow the diﬀusion of atoms across the

FIG. 1: Water NMR Detection. a) Experimental Setup: Tap
water is thermally polarized by passing through a 2 kG per-
manent magnet before ﬂowing into a 1.25” diameter cylin-
der located near the magnetometer inside magnetic shields.
Pump and probe laser beams pass through evacuated glass
tubes to avoid air turbulence. The K cell is a 1” glass sphere

cell. An optical pumping laser spin-polarizes the atoms
while an orthogonal probe laser detects their precession
in the magnetic ﬁeld. Because of slow K diﬀusion, a sin-
gle probe laser expanded to ﬁll the whole cell can be used
to simultaneously measure the magnetic ﬁeld in multiple
points by imaging it on a multi-channel photo-detector.
In this arrangement most elements of the magnetome-
ter are common, allowing one to construct an inexpen-
sive system with hundreds or even thousands of chan-
nels. One challenge for using an atomic magnetometer
for NMR detection is the need to match the resonance
frequencies of the electron and nuclear spins whose gy-
romagnetic ratios are diﬀerent by a factor of 100-1000.
One possibility is to use a set of coils to create diﬀer-
ent magnetic ﬁelds in the NMR sample and the magne-
tometer cell as was recently demonstrated in [10].
If
the nuclear spins are directly interacting with the atomic
magnetometer, one can use these interactions to match
the two resonance frequencies [23].

The experimental arrangement for detection of water
NMR is shown in Fig. 1a). To obtain independent con-
trol of the magnetic ﬁelds experienced by the protons and

of magnetometers. In a uniform magnetic ﬁeld the size of a

because it produces a purely dipolar ﬁeld. Applying a linear
gradient separates the object into slices in the frequency do-
main and the image of each slice can be uniquely obtained
from sensitive measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld outside.

the K magnetometer, the water sample is contained in a
solenoid. The magnetic ﬂux produced by the solenoid is
returned through the magnetic shields, so it’s external
ﬁeld is a factor of 1000 smaller than the internal ﬁeld.
In previous experiments designed to detect NMR with
SQUIDs in a very low magnetic ﬁeld the thermal polar-
ization was increased by brieﬂy sending a large current

magnetic shield is made from a soft METGLAS material
which easily magnetizes and creates a large ﬁeld drift. To
avoid this problem we used a ﬂow system where the wa-
ter was polarized by a permanent magnet outside of the
shields. The K cell is heated to 180◦C in a double-wall
oven made from thin G7 sheets. Hot air ﬂows between the
two walls of the oven but does not cross the path of the
laser beams to avoid optical noise. Microporous thermal
insulation is used to insulate the oven, keeping the total
distance between the K cell and the room-temperature
surface to about 1 cm. Magnetometer coils inside the
shields are used to set to zero the magnetic ﬁeld at the
K cell in order to achieve the maximum sensitivity of the
SERF magnetometer. One coil is also used to generate a
π/2 pulse to tip the proton spins. The transverse relax-
ation time of K spins is much faster than those of protons
in water, so the transient signal of the magnetometer de-
cays quickly relative to water FID. A single-shot water
NMR signal is shown in Fig. 1b) and its FID is shown
in Fig. 1c) The Fourier transform reveals a single peak
at a frequency of 20 Hz with a S/N ratio of greater than
10. The S/N ratio is comparable or better than those
obtained with SQUID magnetometers [1].

In addition to avoiding the need for cryogenics, NMR
detection using atomic magnetometers also allows sim-
ple construction of multi-channel systems. The electron-
ics needed for each channel is much simpler than for an
RF pick-up coil or a SQUID detector and there is no in-
ductive coupling between diﬀerent channels. This opens
the possibility of using spatial information obtained from
a large number of channels to implement more eﬃcient
MRI techniques. Parallel MRI techniques using phased
RF arrays have been used to reduce imaging time by
omitting some phase-encoding steps in a traditional MRI

sequence [24].
It is well known that even a complete
knowledge of the magnetic ﬁeld outside of a closed vol-
ume is not suﬃcient to reconstruct the distribution of
an arbitrary static current or magnetization inside the
volume. The situation is diﬀerent in NMR, where the
magnetization starts out parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld
and always has a non-zero net magnetic moment, elimi-
nating possible silent sources. However, the information
obtained from the external ﬁelds is still insuﬃcient for
imaging. For example, uniform spherical magnetization
distributions of diﬀerent sizes can produce the same mag-
netic dipole ﬁeld. As a result, inversion procedures using
a 3-D grid of discrete dipoles [25, 26] are not unique. It
can be shown that at least one magnetic ﬁeld gradient
has to be applied to solve the inverse problem uniquely,
as illustrated in Fig. 2. The magnetic ﬁeld gradient
separates diﬀerent slices of the sample in frequency and
within each slice an image can be uniquely obtained from
the array of sensors outside. This problem is analogous to
the determination of a 2-dimensional current density or
susceptibility distribution using magnetic ﬁeld measure-
ments [27, 28, 29]. The inverse problem can be solved ex-
actly, however the spatial resolution drops exponentially
with the distance between the magnetometer plane and
the imaging slice. Thus, this imaging method would sac-
riﬁce some spatial resolution to obtain very fast imaging
speed. With a large array of sensitive detectors it should
be possible to obtain a complete 3-D image from a single
FID in less than 1 msec, enabling new MRI applications
of time-varying processes.

Another unique aspect of alkali-metal magnetometers
is their ability to interact directly with the nuclei of in-
terest. This interaction is particularly well understood in
the case of noble gases and has been used to produce hy-
perpolarized gases for a wide range of applications [30].
The attraction of the alkali metal valence electron to the
noble gas nucleus results in an enhancement of the dipo-
lar ﬁeld created by the nuclear spins. For a spherical cell,
the eﬀective ﬁeld experienced by the K atoms is given by

BK =

κ0M,

where M is the nuclear magnetization [12]. Hence, the
classical dipolar ﬁeld produced by nuclear spins is in-
creased by a factor of κ0 which ranges from 6 for 3He
[13] to about 600 for 129Xe [14]. The magnetization of K
atoms MK also creates an eﬀective ﬁeld experienced by
the noble gas,

In a high-density alkali-metal vapor this ﬁeld causes
129Xe atoms to precesses at a frequency of a few Hz while
K atoms remain in a nearly zero ﬁeld.

In Fig. 3 a) we illustrate the principle of the experi-
ment. A small concentration of 129Xe atoms (740 µTorr
of 129Xe enriched to 80%) is added to the magnetometer

cell. 129Xe is polarized parallel to the pump beam by
spin-exchange collisions with K atoms. To tip the 129Xe
spins, a static transverse magnetic ﬁeld Bx of 1 mG is
turned on for about 200 msec. The ﬁeld causes K atoms
to depolarize and 129Xe atoms to precess by π/2. After
the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ, K atoms are quickly repolarized
and 129Xe precess around the ﬁeld BXe. The transverse
oscillating magnetization generates the ﬁeld BK which is
detected by the K magnetometer.

sion. The data are well described by an exponentially-
decaying oscillation after subtracting a slowly-varying
background. The transverse spin relaxation time T ∗

100 µG and increasing the optical pumping rate increases
the 129Xe signal due to a more uniform K polarization.
By measuring the equilibrium 129Xe signal from a train
of π/2 pulses as a function of the separation time between
the pulses we determined T1 relaxation of 129Xe for dif-
ferent temperatures corresponding to diﬀerent densities
of K. Measurements of the eﬀects of K-K spin-exchange
collisions [6, 31] on the K Larmor resonance frequency
and linewidth were used to determined the density and
the polarization of K atoms. For example at 180◦C
the potassium polarization is PK = 85% and the den-
sity is [K] = 2.9 × 1013 cm−3, about 3 times smaller
than saturated vapor pressure. The dependence of 1/T1
on the density of K is shown in Fig. 3c) from which
we determine the K-129Xe spin-exchange cross-section,
σSE = 6.3 × 10−21 cm2, which compares well with a the-
oretical estimate σSE = 8 × 10−21 cm2 [14]. We also
measured the Xe precession frequency as a function of K
density, as shown in Fig. 3d). In accordance with Eq. (2)
the frequency is proportional to the density of K atoms.
From the slope of the ﬁt we determine κ0 = 540, in good
agreement with the theoretical estimate κ0 = 660 [14].

The equilibrium 129Xe polarization is given by PXe =

1013 cm−3 the eﬀective ﬁeld seen by K atoms BK =

of 11.4 pT after correcting for the signal decay during
the dead time of the magnetometer. The S/N is approxi-
mately equal to 10 in a bandwidth of 10 Hz and the eﬀec-
tive measurement volume determined by the intersection
of the pump and probe beams was about 1 cm3. Thus,
1/2
the magnetometer sensitivity is about 7 × 1011/Hz
129Xe atoms. With additional optimization and better
magnetic ﬁeld shielding it should be possible to achieve
magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of better than 1 fT/Hz1/2, giv-
ing sensitivity to about 109 129Xe spins in a single shot.
This detection technique can be easily adapted for detec-
tion of low 129Xe concentration in a ﬂow-though system
[32] as long as 129Xe spends much less than T1 ∼ 20 sec
in the cell. 129Xe can be initially polarized by optical
pumping, ﬂow through the sample where the informa-
tion is encoded in the longitudinal polarization and then
ﬂow through the K cell for detection. This work was
supported by NSF, Packard Foundation and Princeton

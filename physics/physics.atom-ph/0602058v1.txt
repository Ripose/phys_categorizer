Abstract
The Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) method using orbitals centered on the nucleus has recently
been applied to calculate the interactions of positrons interacting with atoms. Computational
investigations of the convergence properties of binding energy, phase shift and annihilation rate
with respect to the maximum angular momentum of the orbital basis for the e+Cu and PsH bound
states, and the e+-H scattering system were completed. The annihilation rates converge very slowly
with angular momentum, and moreover the convergence with radial basis dimension appears to be
slower for high angular momentum. A number of methods of completing the partial wave sum are

INTRODUCTION

In the last few years there have been a number of calculations of positron-binding to atoms
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and positron-scattering from atoms and ions [12, 13, 14]
using orthodox CI type methods with large basis sets of single center orbitals. Besides the
calculations on atoms, there have some attempts to calculate the properties of positrons
bound to molecules with modiﬁed versions of standard quantum chemistry methods [15, 16,
17].

One feature common to all these CI type calculations is the slow convergence of the
binding energy, and the even slower convergence of the annihilation rate. The attractive
electron-positron interaction leads to the formation of a Ps cluster (i.e. something akin to
a positronium atom) in the outer valence region of the atom [2, 9, 18, 19]. The accurate
representation of a Ps cluster using only single particle orbitals centered on the nucleus
requires the inclusion of orbitals with much higher angular momenta than a roughly equiva-
lent electron-only calculation [1, 2, 20, 21]. For example, the largest CI calculations on PsH
and the group II positronic atoms have typically involved single particle basis sets with 8
radial functions per angular momenta, ℓ, and inclusion of angular momenta up to ℓmax = 10
[5, 6, 9]. Even with such large basis sets, between 5-60% of the binding energy and some
30-80% of the annihilation rate were obtained by extrapolating from the ℓmax = 10 to the
ℓmax = ∞ limit.

Since our initial CI calculations on group II and IIB atoms [5, 6, 7], advances in com-
puter hardware mean larger dimension CI calculations are possible. In addition, program
improvements have removed the chief memory bottleneck that previously constrained the
size of the calculation. As a result, it is now appropriate to revisit these earlier calculation
to obtain improved estimates of the positron binding energies and other expectation values.
However, as the calculations are increased in size, it has become apparent that the issue of
slow convergence of the physical observables with the angular momenta of the basis orbitals
is the central technical issue in any calculation.

Whilst it is desirable to minimize the amount of mechanical detail in any discussion
(so as not to distract from the physics), the ability to draw reliable conclusions from any
calculation depends crucially on the treatment of the higher partial waves. For example,
the treatment of the higher partial waves in separate calculations by Saito [11] has already
been shown to be ﬂawed [22] while the present work exposes the defects in the methods of
Gribakin and Ludlow [14]. The present work, therefore, is solely devoted to an in-depth
examination of the convergence properties of mixed electron-positron calculations.

In our previous works, [5, 6, 7, 12, 13], a relatively simple solution to this problem was
adopted. In eﬀect, it was assumed that the successive increments to any observable scaled
as an inverse power series in ℓmax. This approach does have limitations as do the approaches
adopted by other groups [10, 11, 14, 22]. In the present article, we examine the convergence
properties of positron binding calculations upon PsH and e+Cu, and a positron scattering
calculation upon the e+-H system with respect to angular momentum and the dimension
of the radial basis sets. The limitations of existing calculations are exhibited, and some
improved prescriptions for estimating the variational limit are introduced and tested.

II. EXISTING METHODS OF PERFORMING THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM
EXTRAPOLATION

A. The nature of the problem

The positron-atom wave function is written as a linear combination of states created by
multiplying atomic states to single particle positron states with the usual Clebsch-Gordan
coupling coeﬃcients ;

|Ψ; LSi =

ci,j hLiMiℓjmj|LMLihSiMSi

1

2µj|SMSi

Xi,j

× Φi(Atom; LiSi)φj(r0) .

In the case of a single electron system, e.g. H, Φi(Atom; LiSi) is just a single electron
wave function, i.e. an orbital. For a di-valent system, Φi(Atom; LiSi) is an antisymmetric
product of two single electron orbitals coupled to have good Li and Si quantum numbers.
The function φj(r0) is a single positron orbital. The single particle orbitals are written as a
product of a radial function and a spherical harmonic:

φ(r) = P (r)Yℓm(ˆr) .

The radial wave functions are a linear combination of Slater Type Orbitals (STO) [23]
and Laguerre Type Orbitals (LTOs). Most of the time the radial functions are LTOs,
the exceptions occurring for single electron states with angular momenta equal to those
of any occupied core orbitals. Since the Hartree-Fock core orbitals are written as a single
combination of STOs, some of the active electron basis is written as linear combinations of
STOs before the switch to a LTO basis is made. The LTO basis [5, 6] has the property that
the basis can be expanded toward completeness without having any linear independence
problems.

The present discussion is speciﬁc to positronic systems with a total orbital angular mo-
mentum of zero. It is straight-forward to generalize the discussion to states with L > 0, but
this just adds additional algebraic complexities without altering any of the general conclu-
sions.

For a one electron system, the basis can be characterized by the index J, the maximum
orbital angular momentum of any single electron or single positron orbital included in the
expansion of the wave function.

For two electron systems, the L = 0 conﬁgurations are generated by letting the two

electrons and positron populate the single particle orbitals subject to two selection rules,

(1)

(2)

(3)
(4)

max(ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ J ,

min(ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lint .

In these rules ℓ0 is the positron orbital angular momentum, while ℓ1 and ℓ2 are the angular
momenta of the electrons. The maximum angular momentum of any electron or positron
orbital included in the CI expansion is J. The other parameter, Lint is used to eliminate
conﬁgurations involving the simultaneous excitation of both electrons into high ℓ states.
Double excitations of the two electrons into excited orbitals are important for taking electron-
electron correlations into account, but the electron-electron correlations converge a lot more

3

quickly with Lint than electron-positron correlations do with J. Calculations of the positronic
bound states of the group II atoms and PsH [5, 6] showed that the annihilation rate changed
by less than 1% when Lint was varied from 1 to 3. The present set of calculations upon PsH
were performed with Lint = 4. Further details about the methods used to perform the
calculations can be found elsewhere [5, 6].

Various expectation values are computed to provide information about the structure of

these systems. All observable quantities can be deﬁned symbolically as

where ∆X J is the increment to the observable that occurs when the maximum orbital
angular momentum is increased from J −1 to J, e.g.

Hence, one can write formally

hXiJ =

∆X L ,

J

XL=0

∆X J = hXiJ − hXiJ−1 .

hXi∞ = hXiJ +

∆X L .

∞

XL=J+1

(7)

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side will be determined by explicit computation while the
second term must be estimated. The problem confronting all single center calculations is that
most expectation values, hXiJ converges relatively slowly with J and so the contribution
of the second term can be signiﬁcant. A sensible working strategy is to make J as large as
possible while simultaneously trying to use the best possible approximation to mop-up the
rest of the partial wave sum.

B. Existing extrapolation techniques and their limitations

One of the ﬁrst groups to confront this issue and attempt a solution was the York Uni-
versity group of McEachran and Stauﬀer. They performed a series of polarized orbital
calculations of positron scattering from rare gases [24, 25, 26, 27]. The decrease in energy
when the target atom relaxed in the ﬁeld of a ﬁxed positron was used to determine the
polarization potential as a function of the distance from the nucleus. The polarized orbital
method implicitly includes the inﬂuence of virtual Ps formation (within an adiabatic approx-
imation), and this means that slow convergence can be expected. McEachran and Stauﬀer
found that the scattering observables, namely the phase shift, and the Zeﬀ annihilation pa-
rameter, converged slowly with J, the largest angular momentum of the polarized electron
orbital set used to represent the adjustment of the atomic charge cloud in the ﬁeld of the
positron. They took this into consideration by assuming their polarization potential scaled
as J −p and the polarized orbital scaled as J −q at large J. They found p ≈ 3.8 and q ≈ 1.8
for the rare gases at J ≈ 12.

The recent CI-type calculations of Mitroy and collaborators also used an inverse power
relation of J −p, to complete the partial wave sum [5, 6, 12]. In this case, the observables,
εJ , δJ , ΓJ and Z J
eﬀ were extrapolated. This contrasts with the polarized orbital calculations

The correction factor was then evaluated by doing the sum

Gribakin and Ludlow [28] applied perturbation theory and the ideas of Schwartz [29, 30]
to determine the asymptotic behavior of the partial wave increments to the binding energies,
phase shifts and annihilation rates of positron-atom systems. This work is largely derived
from previous work on the partial wave expansion of two electron atoms [31, 32, 33, 34].
They determined that the binding energy E, annihilation rate Γ, phase shift δ, and collisional
annihilation parameter Zeﬀ obey

These expressions are merely the leading order terms of a series of the form

To perform the actual extrapolation during a calculation of positron-hydrogen scattering,
Gribakin and Ludlow [14] did a ﬁt to calculated values at J = 9 and J = 10 with the
formulae

∆EJ = hEiJ − hEiJ−1 ∼

and so determined Zeﬀ and δ. They used the approximate identities in eqs. (15) and (16)
rather than explicitly evaluating the inﬁnite sum. The identities appear to have been derived

the integral they implicitly assume a rectangle rule representation of the integral which is

that the increments decrease as B/(L + 1

(17)

This approximation is accurate to 0.1% for n = 2 and J = 7.

It will be shown that a more serious problem with the Gribakin and Ludlow methodology
is that eqs. (15) and (16) cannot reveal whether the calculated Z J
eﬀ are deviating from the
expected asymptotic form. For example, successive increments to either the phase shift or
Zeﬀ have usually decreased more slowly with J (for J ranging between 10 and 18) than
indicated by eqs. (10)-(13) [5, 6, 12, 13]. Instead of having p = 2 or p = 4 the successive
increments often gave slightly smaller values for p. The approach adopted by Gribakin and
Ludlow is insensitive to these deviations.

Saito has investigated the structure of the PsH and the Ps-halogen systems with the CI
method [9, 11]. A Natural Orbital (NO) truncation algorithm based on the energy was
used to reduce the dimensionality of the secular equations, thus making calculations on
the heavier halogen atoms viable. Besides using the inverse power series, Saito used the
functional form

∆X J = 10−α(log10 J)β +γ ,

(18)

to complete the partial wave sum for the annihilation rate. This function was not based
on any physical principles, and its usage was justiﬁed on the grounds that the increments
were decreasing faster than J −2. However, it has been suggested that the annihilation rate
increments were decreasing too quickly because the dimension of the radial basis used in
the Ps-halogen calculations was simply too small [22]. So the rationale behind the usage of
eq. (18) is questionable.

Some mention must be made of the diﬃculties associated with the slower convergence
of the annihilation rate. Consider the PsH system, a calculation with J = 9 gave 72% of
the total annihilation rate [5]. If one doubled the size of J, then eq. (11) suggests that the
explicit calculation would only recover 86% of the total annihilation rate. And it would take
a calculation with J ≈ 250 to recover 99% of the annihilation rate. The situation is even
more sobering when one considers that the annihilation rate converges faster for PsH (since
it is the most compact) than for any other positron binding system.

III. COMPARISON OF EXISTING AND NEW APPROACHES TO THE PAR-
TIAL WAVE EXTRAPOLATION

A. The diﬀerent alternatives

In order to expose the strengths and deﬁciencies of existing approaches, very large calcu-
lations have been performed on three mixed electron-positron systems. These are the e+-H
scattering system for the ℓ = 0 partial wave, and the bound PsH and e+Cu systems.
It
will be seen that the typical calculations on these real-world systems do not agree perfectly
with the leading order asymptotic form given by Gribakin and Ludlow, i.e. eqs. (10) - (13).

6

Accordingly, six diﬀerent extrapolation methods for determining the J → ∞ correction were
tested. These were:

Method p. The successive increments to all quantities are assumed to obey an

law with the exponent p determined from eq. (20). The value of p derived from three
successive calculation of X J−2,X J−1 and X J is given by

X J =

AX

.

(Note, in previous works we have used a J −p series [1, 5, 6, 12]). The notations pE, pΓ,
pδ and pZ are used to denote the exponents derived from the partial wave expansions of
the energy, annihilation rate, phase shift and Zeﬀ The discrete sum over L in (7) is done
explicitly up to J = 200. The remainder of the sum is then estimated using eq. (17).

Method pav. This is based on Method p. Three successive calculations for (J−2), (J−1)
and J are once again used with eqs. (19) and (20) to determine an initial estimate of p0.
Then, p is set to the average of p0 and the expected value of either 2 or 4. This method
makes an admittedly crude attempt to correct method p in those cases where pδ and pZ
were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 4 and 2 [6]. Once p has been ﬁxed, eq. (19) can then be
used to determine AX and the discrete sum over L in (7) is done explicitly up to J = 200.
The remainder of the sum is then estimated using eq. (17).

Method GL. The relations eq. (15) and (16) are assumed to be exact. The two largest
values of hXiJ are used to determine hZeﬀi∞ and hδi∞. This method mimics the procedure
adopted by Gribakin and Ludlow [14].
Method I. The functional form

∆X J =

BX
(J + 1

2)n

is assumed to apply and the ∆X J increment are used to determine BX. The exponent n
is set to 2 for the annihilation rate and 4 for the energy or phase shift. The discrete sum
over L in (7) is done explicitly up to J = 200 and beyond that point eq. (17) is used. This
method has similarities with the GL method.

Method II. The functional form

∆X J =

BX
(J + 1

2)n +

CX

(J + 1

is assumed to apply and the ∆X J and ∆X J−1 increments are used to determine BX and

The exponent n is set to 2 for the annihilation rate and 4 for the energy or phase shift. The
discrete sum over L in (7) is done explicitly up to J = 200 and beyond that point eq. (17)
is used.

BX, CX and DX. Other particulars are the same as those for Methods I and II.

Method S. The functional form adopted by Saito, eq. (18) is used. The parameters α,
β and γ are determined from ∆X J−2, ∆X J−1 and ∆X J . Then the series is completed by
summing to J = 2000.

B. The e+-H scattering system

The CI-Kohn method has already been used to generate phase shift and annihilation
parameter data for the e+-H scattering system [12]. New calculations with a radial basis
set (i.e. the number of LTOs per ℓ) of increased dimensionality have been done in order to
minimize the inﬂuence of the radial basis upon any conclusions that are drawn. The present
investigation examines s-wave e+H scattering at k = 0.4 a−1
0 .

The largest calculation for e+-H included a minimum of 30 LTOs per ℓ with additional
LTOs included at small ℓ. Special attention was given to the ℓ = 1 positron basis since
this channel is responsible for the long-range polarization potential. The dimension of the
LTO basis was 80 in this case. All radial integrations were taken to 729 a0 on a composite
Gaussian grid. The earlier calculations of Bromley and Mitroy [12] with a minimum of 17
LTOs per ℓ will be presented for comparison. Table I gives the e+-H phase shift and Zeﬀ for
s-wave scattering at k = 0.4 a−1
0 up to J = 12. The larger basis will be referred to as basis
2 while the older basis will be named basis 1.

First of all, the values of pδ and pZ derived from the earlier [12] and present CI-Kohn
calculations are shown together in Figure 1 as a function of J. This ﬁgure tests whether
eqs. (12) and (13) describe the behavior of a real-world calculation.

Neither pδ or pZ are within 1% of the expected asymptotic value at J = 12 and both are
approaching the expected asymptotic limit from below. The two calculations give almost

variational and close-coupling data in the last three rows are taken from calculations which have
basis functions which explicitly depend on the electron-positron distance. The J → ∞ limits were
taken at J = 12 using the various extrapolation methods as described in the text. The value of
p were determined at J = 12 using eq. (20). The previous CI-Kohn estimates [12] include the
J → ∞ correction as determined at that time.

diﬀerence becoming greater as J increases. The increasing diﬀerence between pZ for the two
calculations suggests that a converged calculation of ∆Z J
eﬀ needs an increasingly larger radial
basis as J increases. This point is addressed in more detail later. In most of the calculations
we have performed, the values of p derived from eq. (20) have been slightly smaller than the
expected value at J ≈ 10 [5, 6, 7, 13]. We also note that in all the calculations we have

so far performed, the values of p increase steadily (once the broad features of the physical
system have been achieved) as J increases. While the asymptotic increments to δ and Zeﬀ
do not agree exactly with eqs. (12) and (13), the observed trends do appear to be consistent
with their derived limits.

Figures 2 and 3 show the behavior of the extrapolated δ and Zeﬀ as a function of J for
some of the diﬀerent extrapolations. Table I gives estimates of δ and Zeﬀ using the calculated
values at the largest possible J value (i.e. 12) to determine the J → ∞ corrections.

There is one problem in interpreting the results of Figures 2 and 3 and Table I. The
exact value of Zeﬀ is imprecise at the level of 2-3%. The old calculation of Bhatia et.al.
using rij co-ordinates gives 3.327 [35, 36], the close coupling calculation by Ryzhikh and
Mitroy using the T -matrix method gives 3.332 [39, 40], while the variational calculation of
van Reeth et.al. gives 3.407 [14, 37, 38]. There is also some scatter in the estimates of the
phase shifts, but the degree of diﬀerence between the Bhatia et.al. and van Reeth et.al.
phase shifts is only 0.3%. (the T -matrix phase shift is only expected to have an accuracy of
about 1% [39]).

Figure 2 shows that inclusion of the J → ∞ correction leads to greatly improved estimates
of hδi∞.
In terms of their impact, the methods belong to 3 operational classes. Firstly,
Method p consistently gives the largest values of hδi∞. Fixing pδ to a set value at a ﬁnite
J inevitably results in the J → ∞ correction being overestimated. For example, using
pδ = 3.343 at J = 8 to ﬁx pδ for all J results in increments to ∆δJ that do not decrease
quickly enough. Methods I and GL, on the other hand, tend to underestimate the size of the
J → ∞ correction since pδ = 4 is ﬁxed prior to the sequence of ∆δJ increments achieving
the expected (J + 1

2)−4 form.

Those methods which attempt to allow for deviations from the leading order behavior,
namely Methods II, III and pav approach the expected J → ∞ limit much earlier. Indeed,
their estimates of hδi∞ diﬀer by less than 0.5% at J = 6. Table I reveals that these 3
methods give hδi∞ estimates that diﬀer by less than 0.1% at J = 12. Of the 3 alternatives,

the 3-term asymptotic series, namely Method III, seems to possess the best convergence
properties. Method S also appears to give a reasonable estimate of hδi∞ when J ≥ 6.

The tabulated estimates of hδi∞ at J = 12 reﬂect the discussions in the above paragraph.
Method p gives the largest phase shift while Methods GL and I give the smallest phase
shifts. The maximum diﬀerence between any of the phase shifts is only 0.3% since the net
eﬀect of the J → ∞ contribution to the phase shift is only 2%.

Figure 3 for Zeﬀ shows some features in common with Figure 2. Once again, application
of a J → ∞ correction is seen to give much improved estimates of the hZeﬀi∞ limit. Method
p also gives the largest estimate of Zeﬀ. Method S gives values of hZeﬀi∞ that are generally
the smallest, and Table I reveals that it gives a value that is 0.1 smaller than any of the other
approaches at J = 12. It is not surprising that a method based on a ﬁtting function with no
physical justiﬁcation performs so poorly, and its reasonable estimate of J → ∞ correction to
the phase shift can be regarded as a numerical coincidence. No further discussion of Method
S will be made although values are reported in the later tables for reasons of completeness.
A more detailed analysis and discussion of Figure 3 cannot be made until the convergence

properties of the underlying radial basis are exposed.

C. Convergence properties of the radial basis

In addition to converging very slowly with J, the annihilation rate also converges slowly
with respect to the number of radial basis functions since the actual wave function has a
cusp at the electron-positron coalescence point. A previous CI investigation on helium in
an ℓ = 0 model indicates that the electron-electron δ-function converged as O(N −5/2) where
N is number of Laguerre orbitals [41]. And it has also been demonstrated that the relative
accuracy of the electron-electron δ-function increment for a given size radial basis decreased
as L increased [42].

Some sample ratios can be used to illustrate these points. The ratio RJ

A similar ratio, RJ
δ can be deﬁned for the increment to the phase shifts. A plot of these
two ratios is given in Figure 4, while Table II lists values of RJ
Z for some selected J
values. Figure 4 clearly demonstrates the ∆Z J
eﬀ converges more slowly that the phase shift
increments at large J. First, the annihilation rate is more sensitive to the size of the radial
basis than is the phase shift. Second, the higher partial waves are more sensitive to the size
of the radial basis than the lower partial waves. For example there was a 4.0% increase in
∆Z 8
eﬀ between the basis 1 and basis 2 calculations while there was a larger 7.2% increase in
∆Z 12
eﬀ. However, the increase in ∆δ12 was only 1.7%.

basis 1. For basis 2, the correction of ∆Z J>12
eﬀ = 0.5284 is signiﬁcantly larger.

The implications of these results can be seen by consideration of the Method II plot of Z ∞
eﬀ
depicted in Figure 3. This achieves a maximum value of 3.41 at J = 5, and then decreases
until it is 3.328 at J = 12. The question to be addressed is whether the decrease from J > 6
is due to convergence properties of the calculation with respect to J or the convergence
properties of the basis with respect to N, the number of orbitals per ℓ? Although there are
seven estimates of Zeﬀ that lie between 3.30 and 3.34 in Table I, we believe that the true
value of Zeﬀ lies closer to 3.407 (the value of van Reeth et.al.) than to 3.327 (the value of
Bhatia et.al.).

This interpretation is supported by a crude estimate of the variational limit deduced from
eﬀ increments converge as O(N −5/2) [41].

Z − 1)/0.57). Applying this correction to the data in Table I gives
hZeﬀi∞ = 3.410 when Method II is used to estimate the J → ∞ limit (the actual correction
of ∆Z J>12
of 0.578 was about 9% larger than the basis 2 value). Determination of the
variational limit for the phase shift can also be done by assuming that the ∆δJ increments
converge as O(N −7/2) [41]. In this case, the plotted RJ
δ ratios comprise some 76% of the
correction to the variational limit and thus the ﬁnal estimates of the phase shift increments
would be ∆δJ × (1 + 0.24 × (RJ
δ − 1)/0.76). The Method II phase shift only increased by
1.3 × 10−5 radian giving hδi∞ = 0.12008.

One point from Table I warrants special attention. The 3-term asymptotic series, namely
Method 3, gives a smaller hZeﬀi∞ than Method I! This seems ridiculous given that p = 1.9583
at J = 12. The tendency for the ∆Z J
eﬀ increments to be systematically underestimated
results in the corruption of the BZ, CZ and DZ coeﬃcients extracted from the 3-term ﬁt
and renders Method III unreliable for determination of hZeﬀi∞.

Even though data for only one system has been presented, it is possible to make some
general comments about the performance of the diﬀerence methods since analysis of the e+Cu
and PsH data will conﬁrm these conclusions (they are also compatible with the results of
large basis CI calculations of He [42]).

Since the pδ and pZ exponents tend to be smaller than 4 and 2 respectively at ﬁnite J,
Method p has an inherent tendency to overestimate the J → ∞ corrections. Application of
this approach in the past has not resulted in any gross errors since the problems associated
with ﬁxing p at values less than 2 and 4 tend to cancel out the errors associated with a
radial basis of ﬁnite size p [7]. This method should only be applied in situations when the
asymptotic form of the expectation value under investigation is unknown.

Method I generally underestimates the J → ∞ correction. It gives a useful estimate of
the J → ∞ correction and should mainly be applied to give rough estimates for low precision

calculations. Method GL can be regarded as a variety of Method I that happens to give
inferior J → ∞ corrections.

Methods II and pav were seen to give J → ∞ corrections that were close to each other
once the calculation reached a certain value of J. Method II should be be preferred since it
is founded in correct asymptotics.

Method III seems to give the earliest reliable estimate of the phase shift. However, it
should not be applied to the annihilation rate unless the radial basis is substantially larger
than the present basis. Method III should only be applied in situations where the underlying
partial wave increments have an accuracy of better than 1% and in addition the increments
should vary smoothly and not exhibit ﬂuctuations.

D. The e+Cu ground state

Table III gives the e+Cu binding energy and annihilation rate as a function of J up to
J = 18 for the calculation with 25 LTOs. The table also includes values from a calculation
with the ﬁxed core stochastic variation method (FCSVM) [8, 43]. The FCSVM basis includes
the electron-positron coordinate explicitly and is very close to convergence. The FCSVM
calculation uses a slightly diﬀerent model potential so it is not expected that the CI energy
and Γ should be exactly the same. Figure 5 displays pE and pΓ versus J for two diﬀerent
CI calculations of the e+Cu ground state. One plot is derived from the earlier calculation
of Bromley and Mitroy [12] which included a minimum of 15 LTOs per ℓ-value (basis 1).
The present calculation (basis 2) is much larger with a minimum of 25 LTOs per ℓ value
(note, more than 25 LTOs were included for ℓ = 0, 1 and 2 since these make the largest
contribution to the energy and annihilation rate).

The plots of pE and pΓ against J for e+Cu are similar to the plots of pδ and pZ for
e−-H scattering. Both exponents are generally smaller than the expected asymptotic limits
but steadily increase as J increases. The actual value of pΓ at J = 18, namely 2.030, was
marginally larger than the expected asymptotic limit of pΓ = 2. The estimates of hεi∞ and
hΓi∞ as a function of J are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

FIG. 6: The e+Cu binding energy as a function of J. The diﬀerent curves use diﬀerent algorithms

Table III reveals an 8% increase in Γ when compared with the earlier CI calculation value
of Γ, namely 0.474 ×109 s−1 [8]. This is a consequence of the bigger radial basis used in the
present work. The selected values of RJ
Γ listed in table II reveal an 8.7% increase in ∆Γ16 for
basis 2 compared to basis 1. It is expected that further increases in the radial basis would
eventually lead to a pΓ that was smaller than 2.0 at all J = 18. Again it is noticed that RJ
Γ
(and RJ

E) increase with increasing J.

The estimates of the annihilation rate in table III are all very close together (with the
exception of Method III). This occurs because pΓ = 2.030 is very close to the expected value
of 2.0. The variations between the diﬀerent approaches are largely concerned with taking
care of the deviations from the pΓ = 2 behavior, and with a minimal deviation at J = 18,
one should expect minimal diﬀerences between the ﬁnal results. Method III is the least
accurate (discounting Method S) since it is the most susceptible to the inaccuracies in ∆ΓJ
Figure 7 shows that Method p systematically overestimates hΓi∞ at smaller values of
J. Method I, on the other hand generally gives the smallest estimates of the hΓi∞ and is
consistently too small at lower J.

Method III obtains a reasonable estimate of hεi∞ the quickest. Beyond J > 12 the
Method III binding energy does decrease slightly. This may be due to slower convergence
of the radial basis at higher J. Methods II and pav give roughly equal estimates of hεi∞ for
J > 10, and the spread between the Methods II, III and pav estimates of hεi∞ is only 0.2%
at J = 18.

Method p gives the largest estimate of hεi∞ for all J shown in Figure 6, while Methods I
and GL give the smallest values (with Method GL once again being worse that Method I).
It is worth mentioning that Methods II, III and pav are all roughly constant after J = 16
while Methods I, GL and p are still increasing or decreasing.

In summary, the totality of information in Table III and Figures 5, 6 and 7 is very
reminiscent of the situation for e+-H scattering and is consistent with the conclusions derived
from the analysis of e+-H scattering.

E. The PsH ground state

The best two electron system for validation purposes is the positronium-hydride (PsH)
system since its properties are very well known as a result of previous investigations [44,
45, 46, 47]. The stochastic variational method (SVM) expectation values listed in Table
IV are taken from a new calculation with 1800 ECGs. The energy of this wave function,
E = −0.7891674 Hartree is the best PsH energy so far reported [44].

The orbital basis used in the present calculation was about twice as large as that used in
previous calculations [5, 9]. The number of radial functions per ℓ was 15 with the exception
of ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 1 where 17 and 16 functions respectively were used. The largest J was 13
while Lint was set to 4. The basis functions for each ℓ used a common exponent that had been
energy optimized during some preliminary and smaller calculations. It must be emphasized
that choosing a common λ for both electron and positron states was not arbitrary but was
a consequence of energy optimization process. The results of the CI calculation are listed in
Table IV.

The variation of pE and pΓ with J in Figure 8 reﬂects the behavior seen in Figures 1
and 5. The values of p are smaller than the predicted asymptotic limits and seem to be
approaching the correct value. Computational constraints mean that the dimensions of the
radial basis, e.g. 15 e+ and e− LTOs per ℓ, are smaller than those in the e+-H and e+Cu
calculations. The PsH radial basis is further from convergence than the basis sets used for
the equivalent calculations upon e+-H and e+Cu.

Figure 8 gives p values taken from the CI calculations of Saito [9]. Saito used Natural
Orbital techniques to reduce the dimension of the ﬁnal diagonalization while using an orbital
basis with J = 9 (this is about the same size as in [5]). Saito estimated the variational limit
at each J and the Figure 8 curves were derived from this “full CI limit” calculation. Although
the Saito curves have irregularities, they exhibit a p versus J variation similar to the early
Bromley and Mitroy calculation [5]

Figure 9 shows the variation of hεi∞ vs J. Once again, the 3-term series, Method III

Figure 10 shows the annihilation rate versus J. The CI calculation does not converge
to the SVM annihilation rate since a radial basis of 15 LTOs per ℓ is simply too small.
The RJ
Γ entries in Table II reveal a 13.5% increase in ∆Γ9 between the basis 1 and basis 2
calculations. The conclusions that can be drawn from Figure IV under such circumstances
are somewhat limited. But Method III is again susceptible to the accuracy of the ∆ΓJ
increments and again gives a ﬁnal hΓi∞ that is smaller than Method I. Methods II and
pav again give ﬁnal estimates of hΓi∞ that are close together. Method p gives the largest
estimate of hΓi∞ while Methods I and GL give the smallest.

Another problem with Method III arose from the usage of the Davidson method to
perform the matrix diagonalization. This only gives values of hΓiJ that are stable to 6-7
signiﬁcant digits and this leads to the irregularities in the hΓi∞ evident in Figure 10. The
problem of decreased precision when using the Davidson algorithm had been previously
noted in CI calculations of helium [42] and may be generic to iterative matrix solvers.

IV. COMMENT ON THE SCALING OF THE ANNIHILATION RATE

There is one class of system that has not been studied in the present work, namely the
close to threshold scattering of positrons from atoms that can bind a positron. The behavior
of the ∆Z J
eﬀ increments is complicated by a parametric dependence on the scattering length,
A [8, 12, 48]. Once J is large enough to formally bind a positron, the magnitude of the
scattering length decreases as J increases. Since Zeﬀ ∝ A2, the decrease in A as J increases
impinges on the increase in Z J
eﬀ that would otherwise occur. Indeed, one of the reasons why
calculations on e+Cu were originally taken to J = 18 was to minimize the disruption that
the scattering length had on Zeﬀ [8, 12].

It was not worthwhile to try and analyze the behavior of the partial wave expansion for

delayed until substantially larger basis sets can be deployed.

V. COMMENTARY ON THE WORK OF GRIBAKIN AND LUDLOW

The problems caused by the slow convergence of Zeﬀ can be exposed by a detailed anal-
ysis of the recent Gribakin and Ludlow [14] calculation of the annihilation rate for e+-H
scattering. This calculation used a variant of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) to
generate the initial set of hZeﬀiJ data. They then did a ﬁt to eq. (16) over the J = 7 → 10
interval and then plotted the results of that ﬁt under the assumption that this demonstrated
that their data obeyed eq. (16). However, this procedure as applied by GL could hardly
have been better suited to concealing deviations of the sequence of hZeﬀiJ values from the
2)−2 term (note, in this section the GL acronym refers to the results
leading order (J + 1
presented in [14]). In eﬀect, Figures 7 and 8 of GL are actually a demonstration of Taylor’s
theorem, namely that any continuous function will approximate a straight line if examined
over a suﬃciently small domain.

To illustrate this point, consider a sequence of synthetic hZeﬀiJ data generated by the
2)−2.6 (such a data sequence could be
prescription, hZeﬀi7 = 2.5 and ∆Z J
eﬀ = 20 × (J + 1
generated exactly from a 3-term expansion of eq. (14)). A ﬁt to this sequence was made
using eq. (16) and the results of that ﬁt are shown in Figure 11. Even though the data were
generated according to p = 2.6, a visual inspection (and it should be noted that Figure 11
is much higher resolution than Figures 7 and 8 of GL) suggests that the data are in good
agreement with a p = 2 power law decay whereas this is certainly not the case.

The pZ exponent derived from the recent GL calculation [14] is depicted in Figure 1.
Although GL assume pZ = 2 when making the extrapolation, the actual exponent extracted
from their sequence of Zeﬀ values is p = 2.233 at J = 10. The present basis 2 calculation
gives pZ = 1.885 at J = 10. It is obvious that the GL calculation overestimates the rate
at which ∆Z J
eﬀ will
be too small at higher J and this is the case. GL get ∆Z 10
eﬀ = 0.0501 while the CI-Kohn
calculation gives ∆Z 10
eﬀ = 0.48,

eﬀ increments are decreasing. This implies that the GL estimates of ∆Z J

eﬀ = 0.0604. Consequently, the GL calculation gives ∆Z J>10

while the basis 2 CI-Kohn calculation gives ∆Z J>10
calculation has converged to the region in which the ∆Z J

eﬀ ≈ 0.62. The assertion by GL that their
2 )−2 formula is valid is

eﬀ = B(J + 1

Besides directly leading to less reliable extrapolation corrections, a related problem with
the GL procedure is that it does not have the sensitivity to ﬂag potential problems with
the radial basis. A plot of pZ versus J that crosses the pZ = 2 line is a good indicator of
some inadequacy in the basis. There is no indication that GL were aware that their ∆Z J
eﬀ
were decreasing much too quickly as J increased, their statement that The use of a B-spline
basis means that fast convergence is achieved with respect to the number of states with a
particular angular momentum is diﬃcult to reconcile with the present analysis. However, it
should be noted that do indicate that they could improve the quality of their answers by
“pushing harder” the numerics.

The tendency for the GL calculation to overestimate the convergence of the annihilation
rate increments probably does not arise from MBPT per se, rather it most likely comes from
the underlying single electron basis. Besides the inherently slower convergence at higher
J mentioned earlier, another possibility is due to the conﬁnement of the basis to a box of
radius 15 a0. Conﬁning the basis in this way will result in mean excitation energies (e.g. for
predicting the multi-pole polarizabilities) that will eventually increase as ∼ ℓ2, where ℓ is
the orbital angular momentum, while for a real H atom the mean excitation energy for any ℓ
is less than 1.0 Hartree [49]. Thus the occupancy of the higher J orbitals, which contribute
signiﬁcantly to Zeﬀ will be inhibited, and successive ∆Z J
eﬀ will decrease too rapidly with
increasing J.

The relevance of these issues is best illustrated by a comparison with the exact value of
Zeﬀ which will be taken to be 3.407 at k = 0.4 a−1
0 . This is 0.295 larger than the GL value of
3.112. The underestimation of the higher partial wave contribution in the GL calculation,
estimated at 0.14 = 0.62 − 0.48 is responsible for about 50% of the existing discrepancy.

The discrepancies of GL with the best calculations are are not that severe for s-wave scat-
tering since imposition of the p = 2 condition for J ≥ 10 prevents the inherent deﬁciencies
in their B-spline basis from becoming too excessive. Also s-wave e+-H scattering system is
certainly one of the easier positron annihilation calculations. However, the inadequacy of
the GL methodology manifests itself more severely in other positron annihilation situations.
The CI expansion converges quicker for electron-positron annihilations that take place
at small distances from the nucleus than for annihilations that take place at large distances
[8, 13, 19]. The presence of the centrifugal barrier for L > 0 scattering leads to the electron-
positron annihilations occurring further from the nucleus. Consequently the convergence
problem is more serious for p-wave and d-wave scattering since a proportionally larger part
of Zeﬀ comes from the J → ∞ correction [12, 13]. We have not repeated the earlier p-
wave calculations [12] with a larger radial basis, but a comparison with the CI-Kohn data
at k = 0.4 a−1
indicates that the GL calculation again underestimates the impact of the
0
high J orbitals. The CI-Kohn calculation reported in [12] gave ∆Z 10
eﬀ = 0.0480 while the
GL calculation gave 0.0416. In addition, the CI-Kohn calculation gave p = 1.852 for J =
10 while the GL calculation gave p = 2.152 (it is likely that an inﬁnite basis CI-Kohn
calculation would have p < 1.80 at J = 10). The GL calculation (which gave Zrmef f = 1.607)
underestimates the L = 1 Zeﬀ by about 0.18 at k = 0.4 a−1
(the T -matrix calculation gives
0
1.786 [39, 40] while van Reeth et.al. gave 1.794 [14, 37, 38]). It is likely that at least 0.10 of
the discrepancy will arise from orbitals with J ≥ 10.

One of the major results of the GL calculations was their demonstration that the en-

20

hancement factor is independent of energy. The enhancement factor can be deﬁned as the
factor that the annihilation rate, calculated as a simple product of the electron and positron
densities needs to be increased in order to agree with the exact annihilation rate [13, 48, 50].
They (GL) based this conclusion solely on a forensic analysis of the Zeﬀ annihilation rate
matrix element. Figure 13 of GL reveals that the variation of the d-wave enhancement fac-
tor with energy is noticeably larger than either the s-wave or p-wave enhancement factor
[14]. Since a larger fraction of the d-wave Zeﬀ comes from J ≥ 10, the possibility exists
that this stronger energy dependence is due to extrapolation issues as opposed to dynamical
eﬀects. Although GL seem unaware of the result, the slow variation of the enhancement
factor with energy had been demonstrated in a model potential analysis [48]. Comparisons
of model potential calculations with ab-initio variational and polarized orbital calculations
had shown that a model potential calculation tuned to reproduce the energy dependence of
the phase shifts also gave the energy dependence of Zeﬀ [48]. The variation of the d-wave
enhancement factor was determined by tuning a model potential to the large basis phase
shifts of [51] and then normalizing to a similar calculation of Zeﬀ [40]. The variation in the
d-wave enhancement factor over the energy range from k = 0 to 0.5 a−1
0 was less than 4%.
Although the model potential result is not conclusive, it does appear that the variation in
the d-wave Zeﬀ is less than that indicated by the GL calculation.

Another area where application of the GL methodology could lead to larger than an-
ticipated errors is in the determination the angular correlation or the γ energy spectrum
[52]. These two properties depend on the relative momentum of the annihilating electron-
positron pair [45, 53]. It is known from investigations of momentum space wave functions
that the low momentum part of the wave function largely arise from the large r part of the
wave function while the high momentum properties come from the small r part of the wave
function [54]. Under such circumstances, application of the GL method could easily result
in errors to the J → ∞ corrections that depend systematically on the γ-energy or recoil
momentum.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Single center methods represent a superﬁcially attractive method to study mixed electron
positron systems since existing computer codes can be adapted without too much eﬀort. The
penalty associated with this approach is the slow convergence of the binding energy and,
more noticeably, the annihilation rate with respect to the partial wave expansion of the single
particle basis. The results presented here are generally consistent with the asymptotic limits
derived from second-order perturbation theory by Gribakin and Ludlow [28]. The actual
calculations at ﬁnite J generally give increments to the energy (phase shift) and annihilation
rate that decrease slightly slower than the GL limits, but the overall trends are compatible
with the GL limits.

The tendency for the convergence with respect to the radial basis size to slow down as
J increases does have implications for the design of any CI type calculation. Some sort of
extrapolation in J is necessary in order to determine the energy and more particularly the
annihilation rate. But there is no point in making J bigger if this is done at the expense of
the radial basis set. One simply ends up with increments to the energy or annihilation rate
which are systematically too small at higher J. This problem does not seem to be restricted
to the LTO basis used in the present work. Convergence problems at high J are also present
for the Gribakin and Ludlow calculations which used a B-spline basis [14] and the Saito

21

calculations which used a natural orbital basis [9, 11, 22]. It is amusing to note that the one
of the ﬁrst manifestations of this problem occurred over 40 years ago [29, 55].

The best methods for estimating the J → ∞ corrections depends on the quality of
the underlying calculation. For a low precision calculation, Method I would seem to be
appropriate. A low precision calculation can probably be regarded as one with pE or pΓ
exceeding 4 or 2 respectively when the J → ∞ correction is evaluated (assuming that p
approaches its limiting value from below). Methods II or III would seem to be the preferred
options for a high precision calculation. As a general principle, inclusion of the second term
in the asymptotic series leads to improved hXi∞ predictions when compared with asymptotic
series with the single term series. Method III is more susceptible to imperfections in the
radial basis and should not be applied to the calculation of the annihilation rate unless a
Irrespective of how the J → ∞ corrections are

evaluated, it is essential that the exponents p relating the changes in the expectation values
be examined as a test of the quality of the radial basis.

The overall situation regarding the use of single center methods to compute positron-
atom phase shifts or energies is that calculation to the sub 1% accuracy level is achievable
for those systems that have a parent atom ionization potential greater than 0.250 Hartree.

The O((J + 1
as the method used to perform the J → ∞ correction is more sophisticated than those used
previously. However, the situation with respect to the annihilation rate is much grimmer
and it is not possible to guarantee 1% accuracy for even the simple e+-H system. Here the

O((J + 1
convergence with respect to the radial basis is further complicated by the fact that it is
slower at high J than low J. In this case, it appears that “God is on the side of the big
basis set” [56].

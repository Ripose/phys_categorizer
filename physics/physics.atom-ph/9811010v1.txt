Abstract

We show that the spectrum and eigenstates of open-shell multicharged
atomic ions near the ionization threshold are chaotic, as a result of extremely
high level densities of multiply excited electron states (103 eV−1 in Au24+)
and strong conﬁguration mixing. This complexity enables one to use sta-
tistical methods to analyse the system. We examine the dependence of the
orbital occupation numbers and single-particle energies on the excitation en-
ergy of the system, and show that the occupation numbers are described by
the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and temperature and chemical potential can be
introduced. The Fermi-Dirac temperature is close to the temperature deﬁned
through the canonical distribution. Using a statistical approach we estimate
the contribution of multielectron resonant states to the radiative capture of
low-energy electrons by Au25+ and demonstrate that this mechanism fully
accounts for the 102 times enhancement of the recombination over the direct
radiative recombination, in agreement with recent experimental observations.

I. INTRODUCTION

∼

In this paper we investigate the spectrum and eigenstates of a multicharged positive ion
at energies close to its ionization threshold I. Using Au24+ (I = 750 eV) as an example,
we show that this spectrum is dominated by multiple electron excitations into a few low-
lying unoccupied orbitals. As a result, it is extremely dense, with level spacings
1 meV
between the states of a given total angular momentum and parity J π. The electron Coulomb
interaction induces strong mixing of the multiply-excited conﬁgurations, which leads to a
statistical equilibrium in the system. The latter is similar to a thermal equilibrium, and
variables such as temperature can be introduced to describe it. This enables one to use a
statistical approach in the situation where a full dynamical quantum calculation is simply
impossible because of the enormous size of the Hilbert space (>
∼

We apply this approach to the problem of radiative capture of low-energy electrons by
multicharged positive ions, and show that in these systems the contribution of resonant mul-
tielectronic recombination that proceeds via electron capture into the multiply-excited com-
pound states, is responsible for high recombination rates, much greater than those expected
from the simple direct radiative recombination. Our calculation resolves quantitatively the
long-standing puzzle of huge enhancements of the electron-ion recombination rates, and es-
sentially removes the “enormous discrepancies between theoretical and experimental rate
coeﬃcients” [1]. The situation here turns out to be similar to the radiative neutron capture
by complex nuclei [(n, γ) reaction] where the resonance mechanism involving the compound
nucleus states is also much stronger than the direct capture [2].

105 for Au24+).

So far the enhancement of the recombination rates at low electron energies <
∼

1 eV has
been observed for a number of ions [3]. Its magnitude ranges from a factor of about ten
for Ar13+ [4], Au50+ and Pb53+ [5], and U28+ [6], to over a hundred for Au25+ [1]. This
enhancement is sensitive to the electronic structure of the target, e.g., the recombination
rates of Au49+ and Au51+ are much smaller than that of Au50+ [5]. For few-electron ions,
e.g., C4+, Ne7+ and Ar15+ [7–9], the observed rates are described well by the sum of the
direct and dielectronic recombination rates. In more complicated cases, like U28+ or Au25+,
the questions of what are the particular resonances just above the threshold and how they
contribute to the recombination “remain a mystery” [10].

II. SPECTRUM AND EIGENSTATES OF AU24+

Let us consider the problem of electron recombination on Au25+. Due to electron cor-
relations the low-energy electron can be captured into an excited state of the compound
Au24+ ion. This system is the main object of our analysis. Au24+ has 55 electrons.
Its
ground state belongs to the 1s2 . . . 4f 9 conﬁguration. Figure 1 shows the energies of its rel-
ativistic orbitals nlj obtained in the relativistic Hartree-Fock calculation [11]. The energy
of the highest orbital occupied in the ground state is ε4f7/2 =
27.9 a.u. This value gives
an estimate of the ionization potential of Au24+: I
. Our relativistic conﬁguration-
interaction (CI) calculation of the ground states of Au24+4f 9 and Au24+4f 8 shows that they
are characterized by J = 15
18764.80
2 and 6, and their total energies are
a.u., respectively. Thus, the ionization threshold of Au24+ is I = 27.56 a.u.= 750 eV, in
agreement with [1].

The excited states of the ion are generated by transferring one, two, three, etc. electrons
from the ground state into empty orbitals above the Fermi level (Fig. 1), or into the
partially occupied 4f orbitals. We are interested in the excitation spectrum of Au24+ near
its ionization threshold. This energy (27.5 a.u.) is suﬃcient to push up a few of the nine
4f electrons, and even excite one or two electrons from the 4d orbital [12]. However, the
preceding 4p orbital is already deep enough to be considered inactive. Thus, we consider
Au24+ as a system of n = 19 electrons above the frozen Kr-like 1s2 . . . 4p6 core.

The number of multielectron states obtained by distributing 19 electrons over 31 rela-
tivistic orbitals, 4d3/2 through to 7g9/2, is enormous, even if we are only interested in the
excitation energies below 27.5 a.u. It is impossible to perform any CI calculation for them.
However, there is another simpler way to analyse the spectrum. The scale of the conﬁgu-
ration interaction strength is determined by the two-body Coulomb matrix elements which
transfer electrons between diﬀerent conﬁgurations. Their typical size in neutral atoms is
1 eV, and in Au24+ it is about 1 a.u., which is roughly 25 times greater, due to the
∼
smaller radius of the ion. This scale is much smaller than I. Conﬁguration mixing aside,
the CI does not shift the mean energies of the conﬁgurations. Therefore, we can construct
the excitation spectrum of Au24+ by calculating the mean energies Ei of the conﬁgurations,
and the numbers of many-electron states Nk within each of them:

a.u. is close to what one obtains from the Hartree-Fock orbital spectrum in Fig. 1 [14]. For
most abundant J π states the density ρJ π(E) is given by Eq. (5) with AJ π

At ﬁrst sight the huge level density makes the spectrum of Au24+ enormously compli-
cated. On the other hand, this complexity enables one to analyse the system using statistical
methods. The interaction between multiply-excited conﬁguration states mixes them com-
pletely, and they loose their individual features. In this regime the spectral statistics become
close to those of a random matrix ensemble, the eigenstates cannot be characterized by any
quantum numbers except the exact ones (energy and J π), and the orbital occupation num-
bers deviate prominently from integers. This regime can be described as many-body quantum
chaos. We have extensively studied it in direct numerical calculations for the rare-earth atom
of Ce – a system with four valence electrons [15–18].

matrix for J π = 13
. This total angular momentum value is among the most abundant

in the spectrum, as there are 1254 J π = 13
states. The mixing of the two conﬁgurations

included is practically complete, since the weight of each conﬁguration in every eigenstate is
close to 50%. Shown in the upper part of Fig. 3 are the components of the 590th eigenstate
at the middle of the two-conﬁguration spectrum. Both the ﬂuctuations of Ck as function
of basis state k, and the localization of the eigenstate components in the vicinity of the
corresponding eigenvalue (E = 27.51 a.u. above the Au24+ ground state) are evident.

III. STATISTICAL APPROACH

The spreading of the basis states due to conﬁguration interaction introduces natural sta-
tistical averaging in the system. Based on this averaging, a statistical theory of ﬁnite Fermi
systems of interacting particles can be developed [19]. It enables one to calculate various
properties of the system as sums over the basis states, without actually diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian matrix. For example, the mean orbital occupations numbers can be obtained
as

and calculated the mean orbital occupation numbers as functions of the excitation energy
E using ∆E = 1 a.u., Fig. 4. Of course, in our calculation we sum over the conﬁgurations,
rather than the actual many-electron basis states, and use their mean energies and weights
given by Eqs. (1) and (2), cf. Eq. (4).

The oscillatory dependence with the period of about 3–4 a.u. is due to the shell structure
of the Au24+ ion, Fig. 1. As the excitation energy increases the oscillations die out. Apart
from this the occupation numbers of the orbitals below the Fermi level (4d and 4f ) decrease,
and those above it (5s, 5p, etc.) increase, as one would expect in a Fermi system. It seems
very natural to try to describe this behaviour in the spirit of statistical mechanics, by

5

introducing temperature and applying the standard Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution [18,20].
Of course, temperature can always be used to describe the equilibrium of a macroscopic
system that contains a large number of particles, or to describe a small system interacting
with a heat bath. In what follows we are going to see if the notion of temperature can be
applied to our isolated system with a small number of active particles1.

at a given temperature T and chemical potential µ depends on the single-particle orbital
energies εa. These energies are well deﬁned for non-interacting particles in a given potential.
For interacting particles (electrons in an atom or ion) one can introduce single-particle
orbitals and energies using a mean ﬁeld approximation, e.g.
the Hartree-Fock method.
From this points of view we could use the orbital energies εHF
found in the mean ﬁeld of
the Au24+ ground state 1s2 . . . 4d104f 9, Fig. 1. However, they may only be suitable at low
excitation energies, when the mean ﬁeld is close to that of the ground-state Au24+.

a

As the excitation energy increases the orbital occupation numbers change noticeably, as
shown by Fig. 4. This gives rise to a change of the mean ﬁeld, and as a result, the orbital
energies are shifted by

δεa(E) =

Uabδnb(E) ,

Xb

(10)

−

where δnb = nb(E)
nb(0) is the diﬀerence between the occupation numbers at energy E and
in the ground state at E = 0. Using our numerical energy-dependent occupation numbers
we ﬁnd the energy dependence of the orbital energies, shown for a few low-lying orbitals in
Fig. 5. With the increase of the excitation energy the electrons are transferred into higher
orbitals which have larger radii. Accordingly, the electron cloud becomes more diﬀuse, the
screening of the nuclear potential is reduced, and the orbital energies go down. This eﬀect
is especially strong for the inner 4d and 4f orbitals. As we will see below the shift of the
lower orbital energies is comparable with the temperature of the system, and it has to be
taken into account when applying the FD formula.

In Fig. 6 we present the single-particle occupation numbers at ﬁve diﬀerent excitation

energies, as functions of the shifted orbital energies

temperature” T on the energy of the system (solid circles).

Occupation numbers aside, the relation between the temperature and energy can be

deﬁned by the level density ρ(E), Eq. (4), through the canonical average

using the smooth ﬁt (5). The latter yields T
systems. Figure 8 shows that for the energies above 3 a.u. all three deﬁnitions of temperature
give close values. As is known, the expansion of the chemical potential in a Fermi system at
small temperatures starts with a T 2 term [21]. Accordingly, its shift from the ground-state
value is proportional to the energy. Indeed, a simple linear ﬁt µ =

If we use T (E) given by the canonical deﬁnition and the linear ﬁt of µ, together with
the orbital energies [Eq. (11)], the FD formula gives smooth energy dependencies of the
occupation numbers, see Fig. 4. They reproduce the behaviour of the numerical occupation
numbers averaged over the shell-structure ﬂuctuations.

IV. DIRECT AND RESONANT RECOMBINATION

Let us now estimate the direct and resonant contributions to the recombination rate
of Au25+. The direct radiative recombination cross section is estimated by introducing an
eﬀective ionic charge Zi into the Kramers formula, which describes radiative electron capture
in the Coulomb potential, see e.g. [22],

where ε is the initial electron energy, n is the principal quantum number of the ﬁnal elec-
tron state, and atomic units are used (Ryd = 1

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the resonant radiative capture mechanism fully explains the strongly en-
hanced recombination rates observed for eV electrons on multicharged ions. Its origin is in
the high level densities of chaotic multiply-excited electron states in multicharged ions. The
size of the enhancement is sensitive to the electron structure of the ion, which determines
the level density. We have shown that a statistical approach can be applied to the analysis
of this complex system. One can also use a statistical theory to calculate mean-squared ma-
trix elements between multiply excited chaotic states in terms of single-particle amplitudes,
occupation numbers, Γspr and D [15,17,24], and obtain accurate quantitative information
about the processes involving chaotic states and resonances. At higher electron energies the
resonant capture proceeds via so-called doorway states [13] – simple dielectronic autoionizing
states, which are then “fragmented” into the dense spectrum of multiply-excited resonances
(see [10] and [17] and Refs. therein).

[11] All orbitals below the Fermi level, 1s to 4f , were obtained in the self-consistent cal-
culation of the Au24+ ground state. Each of the excited orbitals above the Fermi level
– 5s, 5p, etc., was calculated by placing one electron into it in the ﬁeld of the frozen
1s2 . . . 4f 8 core.

[12] Inﬁnite Rydberg series belong to the single-particle aspect of the Au25+ + e− problem,

and we do not consider them here.

[14] The other two parameters are diﬀerent from the non-interacting Fermi-gas model values
A = 1/√48 and ν = 1. The latter values in fact lead to strong underestimation of the
level density.

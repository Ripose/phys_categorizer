We present a theoretical model describing recently observed collective eﬀects in large magneto-
optically trapped atomic ensembles. Based on a kinetic description we develop an eﬃcient test
particle method, which in addition to the single atom light pressure accounts for other relevant
eﬀects such as laser attenuation and forces due to multiply scattered light with position dependent
absorption cross sections. Our calculations conﬁrm the existence of a dynamical instability and
provide deeper insights into the observed system dynamics.

PACS numbers: 32.80.Pj, 42.50.Vk, 47.35.-i, 52.35.-g

Since its ﬁrst realization in 1987 [1] the magneto-
optical trap (MOT) has become a standard technique
for providing a robust source of large numbers of cold
atoms. While multiple scattering of the absorbed laser-
light is known as a major limitation for achieving Bose-
Eintein condensation, it also leads to interesting collec-
tive eﬀects which have been studied over the last years
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and a variety of static structures has
been observed and investigated by diﬀerent theoretical
approaches [3, 5, 8, 9].

Only recently, experiments have revealed a so far unex-
plored dynamical instability in three-dimensional MOTs
connected with the appearance of self-excited radial os-
cillations [11], which constitutes a complex nonlinear dy-
namics phenomenon. Understanding the observed eﬀect
turns out to be of broader interest, as it provides a clean
laboratory realization of similar plasma- and astrophysi-
cal phenomena, such as, e.g., pulsating stars [12], which
are generally diﬃcult to access.

Here we develop a theoretical model, describing the ob-
served instability and providing a physical picture of the
underlying mechanism. As discussed in [7], sub-Doppler
cooling mechanisms only aﬀect a very small fraction of
large trapped atom clouds. Hence, the overall behavior
of large atomic ensembles is well described within a ba-
sic Doppler-cooling picture, where the resulting trapping
force along each laser beam can be written as [13, 14]

is the absorption cross section for the two laser beams
(including a saturation by the 3 pairs of laser beams),
σ0 = 3λ/2π the on-resonance absorption cross section,
λ the laser wavelength, Γ the transition linewidth, δ

the detuning from resonance, µx determines the Zee-
man shift of the atomic transition due to the MOT
magnetic ﬁeld and s± = I±/Isat denotes the satura-
tion parameter of the respective laser beam of inten-
sity I± with Isat being the saturation intensity of the
atomic transition. For the discussion below it is con-
venient to split the force according to Ftrap(x, v) =
α(|x|)x + β(|x|, |v|)v, with α(|x|) = Ftrap(|x|, 0)/|x| and
β(|x|, |v|) = (Ftrap(|x|, |v|) − Ftrap(|x|, 0))/|v|.

In order to simplify our theoretical considerations we
use the following spherical symmetric generalization of
eq.(1)

Ftrap = α(r)r + β(r, v)v ,

(3)

While experimental conﬁnement conﬁgurations generally
do not obey this symmetry, eq.(3) describes the impor-
tant features of the resulting force in both the linear and
nonlinear trapping regions.

At higher densities, attenuation of the laser light inside
the cloud, results in an additional eﬀective conﬁning force
experienced by the atoms [15]. To account for this eﬀect
within our spherical symmetry assumption, the spatial
intensity proﬁle is obtained from

where s0 is the saturation parameter of the incident
beam. Moreover, multiple scattering of the absorbed
laser light inside the cloud leads to an additional outward
directed pressure, caused by an eﬀective interaction be-
tween the atoms [2]. Neglecting higher order scattering
events, which are known to screen the atom-atom inter-
action [16], a photon scattered oﬀ an atom at position
r1 exerts an average force on an absorbing atom at r2
according to [2, 4]

The reabsorption cross section σ(+/−)
is obtained by con-
volving the absorption cross section of the emitted light
with the emission spectrum of the atom at r1 in the pres-
ence of either left or right circularly polarized laser light.
Note that σrsc may depend on both coordinates via the
space dependence of the local laser intensities as well as
of the respective detunings. Previously [3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10],
such coordinate dependencies have been neglected, which

according to eq.(5) results in a Coulomb-like interaction
with eﬀective charges, again underlining the close anal-
ogy with plasma and gravitational physics problems. In
large clouds, however, we ﬁnd the position dependence of
the eﬀective charges to be important for the static and
dynamics properties of the trapped atom cloud.

Starting from eqs.(2)-(5) the collective system dynam-

ics is described by the following kinetic equation

for the atomic phase space density f (r, v, t), where

Fmf (r) =

Z

and M is the mass of the atoms. Heating by sponta-
neous emission and photon exchange [16, 17] has been
neglected, since for the densities considered in this work
the corresponding thermal pressure is much smaller than
the pressure resulting from the eﬀective atomic repulsion.
Note that eq.(7) goes beyond a local-density approxi-
mation [16], retaining the complete position dependence
of σrsc and the density dependence of Frsc. In fact, this
nonlocal space dependence of all forces in eq.(6) in addi-
tion to their local dependence on the atom position ren-
ders a direct numerical solution of eq.(6) very demanding.
Alternatively, we apply an eﬃcient numerical procedure
based on a test-particle treatment, similar to particle-
in-cell methods [18], frequently used for plasma physics
problems. More speciﬁcally, we represent the atomic den-
sity by an ensemble of Nt < 106 test particles, whose
number is typically chosen to be less than the actual par-
ticle number to reduce the numerical eﬀort. The respec-
tive absorption cross sections and masses of the test par-
ticles are adjusted, such that the results are independent
of the number Nt of test particles. By propagating every
particle according to the forces eq.(3) and (7) we obtain
the time dependent density from which we calculate the
local intensities and the resulting forces to advance the
next timestep.

To study its stationary properties we evolve the atomic
cloud until it relaxes to the selfconsistent, stationary solu-
tion of eq.(6), which we found to exist only below a criti-
cal atom number Nc. Fig.1a shows the calculated station-
ary density proﬁle for N = 1.15 × 109 Rubidium atoms
and typical MOT-parameters of I = 1.0mW/cm2, δ =
−1.5Γ and Γ/µ = 4.7mm (corresponding to 9G/cm)[11].
As can be seen, the calculated density is well described
by a truncated Gaussian proﬁle. As the atom number
is decreased the truncation radius R decreases relative
to the rms-width of the corresponding Gaussian, ulti-

mately leading to a transition into a uniform density pro-
ﬁle. Similar changes in the density proﬁle have also been
reported in MOTs, where the nonlinearity of the poten-
tial arises from sub-Doppler trapping mechanisms [7, 19].
In the present case the observed transition results from
the nonlinearity and the position dependence of the re-
absorption cross section and, hence, can not be found
under the assumption of linear trapping forces and pure
Coulomb-like interactions [3, 4, 10].

Let us now turn to the most striking result of our calcu-
lations. As we further increase the number N of atoms
the cloud becomes unstable at a critical atom number
Nc, corresponding to a critical radius Rc. By varying

the various MOT-parameters, we ﬁnd that the critical
radius is uniquely determined by the relation Rc = δ/µ
(see ﬁg.3a), conﬁrming the conclusion reached in [11].
This fact is illustrated in ﬁg.1b and 1c, where we show
the radial dependence of the trapping and interaction
force as well as the damping constant β(r, v = 0). The
damping constant β(r, 0) reverses its sign at Rc = δ/µ.
Hence, any small velocity of atoms outside of Rc will
be enhanced. While inward moving particles will be
damped again when entering the negative-β region, out-
ward moving atoms around Rc are further accelerated
away from the trap center, since the single atom light
pressure force is largely balanced by the interaction force
around r = Rc. Their motion around the ﬁxed point
(r = Rc, v = 0) will become unstable and limited by
the non linear terms of the force. At larger distances,
however, the total force reverses its sign again, since the
interaction force decreases much more rapidly than the
trapping, due to the radially increasing Zeeman shift (see
ﬁg. 1b). Hence, if during the expansion, the atoms did
not acquire a velocity beyond the capture range of the
MOT, a stable limit cycle will be reached.

In order to characterize the onset of the instability
hr2i /3 and
we analyze the clouds RMS radius σ =
study its sensitivity against a small perturbation. More
precisely, we start from a stationary density correspond-
ing to some detuning δ0 which is instantly increased to
δ (closer to resonance), leading to damped oscillations
of σ towards its new equilibrium value σ∞, as shown
in ﬁg.2a. From a ﬁt to a damped harmonic oscillation
σ = ∆σe−t/τ sin(ωt + φ) + σ∞ we obtain the damp-
ing time τ and frequency ω corresponding to the real

p

and imaginary part of the respective Lyapunov exponent
λ = τ −1 + iω (ﬁg.3b). For increasing N and the param-
eters of ﬁg.2 the instability sets in at an atom number of
Nc = 1.226 × 109 and with a critical exponent of 0.55.
On the other hand, the frequency of the cloud oscilla-
tion evolves continuously through the instability thresh-
old (see ﬁg.2), indicating that the onset of the instability
proceeds via an supercritical Hopf-bifurcation.

A reduction of the system properties to a single quan-
tity like the cloud’s RMS-radius is clearly helpful for un-
derstanding the transition into the oscillating regime. On
the other hand the fully resolved space-time evolution of
the atomic density such as shown in ﬁg.4 reveals much
more detailed information about the complicated dynam-
ics of the cloud. Indeed, the complex density patterns at
larger atom numbers (see ﬁg.4) shows that the oscillation
dynamics is much more complex than a simple breathing
mode, as suggested by the simple size oscillations close
to the instability threshold (see ﬁg.2b).

In fact, the oscillation is triggered by an outer fraction
of atoms, which gain energy as they move in and out of
the active region of r > Rc, which is indicated by the
horizontal white line in ﬁg.4. When bouncing back on
the low-energetic atoms, the gained energy is deposited
by exciting a density wave just inside the region with
β(r, 0) < 0. Subsequently, the formed nonlinear excita-
tion propagates towards the trap center along the diag-
onal blue line drawn in ﬁg.4 and thereby loosing energy,
mostly due to the damping by the cooling lasers. As can
be seen in ﬁg.4 this not only leads to a ﬂattening and
broadening of the density wave until it disappears, but
also to a deceleration as indicated by the deviation of

the moving maximum from the blue line at smaller dis-
tances. At the same time, the edge region of the atomic
cloud starts to relax, causing some atoms to be again
accelerated away from the center and the whole process
repeats itself. Although this scenario clearly provides
the basic mechanism for the observed oscillations, our
calculations reveal a number of ﬁner details (see ﬁg.4)
still to be understood. Moreover, additional damping
mechanisms, similar to Landau-damping of plasma waves
might also play a role for the system dynamics, raising
the interesting question of how the present nonlocal po-
sition dependence of the eﬀective charges manifests itself
in known plasma kinetic eﬀects.

In conclusion, large clouds of magneto-optical conﬁned
atoms have been found to exhibit a very complex nonlin-
ear dynamics. Our theoretical description has revealed
the onset of a deterministic instability connected with
self-sustained oscillations in agreement with recent exper-
iments [11]. It has been found that a number of diﬀerent
eﬀects, such as the attenuation of the trap lasers, rescat-
tering of the absorbed laser light as well as the position
dependence of the respective absorption cross sections
are all necessary to explain the observed phenomenon.
A stability analysis of the MOT size has shown that the
transition proceeds via a supercritical Hopf-bifurcation.
The obtained density evolution revealed the build-up of
complex nonlinear excitations driven by the combined ac-
tion of the light-pressure force and the eﬀective atomic
interaction, which results in an active atomic motion at
large distances. Similar types of active or self-driven mo-
tion are currently discussed in a broad range of diﬀer-
ent applications, such as collective swarm dynamics [20],
propagation of waves [21] or dissipative solitons [22] in
reaction-diﬀusion systems or grain motion in dusty plas-
mas [23]. Hence, we believe that large clouds of magneto-

We present magnetic traps with toroidal (T 2) and ring-shaped topologies. The trapping poten-
tial of a ring-shaped magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld is modiﬁed by radio-frequency ﬁelds, resulting in
adiabatic potentials for the dressed Zeeman states. Simple adjustment of the radio-frequency ﬁelds
provides versatile possibilities for dynamical parameter tuning, topology change, and controlled po-
tential perturbation. We show how toroidal and poloidal rotations can be induced, and demonstrate
the feasibility of preparing degenerate quantum gases with reduced dimensionality and periodic
boundary conditions. The great level of dynamical control is useful for atom interferometry.

Cold neutral atoms are particularly well suited as a
generic model for many-body systems as they allow to
tune parameters that are not accessible in other systems
such as the inter-particle interaction strength and the
Fermi energy [1]. Studying the properties of quantum
gases in conﬁning geometries where the dimensionality
of the system can be chosen or even be adjusted is at the
focus of current research [2]. The dimensionality of the
conﬁned cloud plays a key role for important properties
such as long range order [3] and superﬂuidity [4, 5, 6] of
the gas. This is also true for the topology of the trap,
and hence large interest in multiply connected trapping
potentials such as rings has recently emerged.

In ﬁrst experiments with non-trivial trapping topolo-
gies, ultra-cold and Bose condensed atoms have been
demonstrated in ring shaped potentials [7, 8, 9]. Most
of these experiments rely on the production of a two-
dimensional magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld in the shape of a
ring to trap the atoms. The ring of zero ﬁeld in the cen-
ter of this trap causes loss of atoms due to Majorana spin
ﬂips to untrapped states. These leaks have been plugged
using time orbiting ring traps (TORT) [8], out-of-plane
current carrying wires [9], or stadium-shaped traps re-
ducing the ring of zero to four points [10].

In this paper, we present a trapping conﬁguration that
enables the conﬁnement of gases in a variety of multi-
ply connected topologies. We use a combination of static
and oscillating magnetic ﬁelds that results in adiabatic
potentials for the dressed states [11, 12, 13, 14]. Reach-
ing beyond simple ring geometries, toroidal surfaces can
be formed and smoothly be transformed to a (multiple)
ring geometry. One- and two-dimensional quantum gases
with periodic boundary conditions are accessible as well
as the crossover regimes between conﬁnement of diﬀerent
dimensionality (3d to 2d and 1d, and 2d to 1d). More-
over, we show that the trapped gases can be dynamically
set into various types of motion by simple experimental
techniques. These include toroidal and poloidal rotations
on torus surfaces, and independently controlled accelera-

tion along circular paths. We discuss the potential forma-
tion, give examples for various conﬁgurations, and study
the feasibility of applications ranging from phase transi-
tions in low dimensional conﬁnement to interferometry.
Our trapping conﬁguration is based on magnetic
micro-structures, which have been proposed and demon-
strated for atom trapping both using current-carrying
wires [15, 16, 17] and permanent magnetic structures
[18, 19, 20]. We start from a ring-shaped magnetic
quadrupole ﬁeld, generated by two concentric rings of
magnetized material with out-of-plane magnetization M ,
see Fig. 1. The motivation here are high ﬁeld gradients
(up to 103 T/m), and the absence of lead wires that
break the symmetry of the trap. For small heights h of
the magnetic layer, the ﬁeld sources become equivalent
to two pairs of concentric, counter-propagating, line-like
currents I = M h around the edges of the material. They
produce a magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld with a ring-shaped
line of zero ﬁeld. We assume that the radii of the rings are
large compared to their widths and separation, R
d, w.
In this case, the ﬁeld in the vicinity of the magnetic rings
can be approximated by a cylindrical quadrupole ﬁeld

Cold atoms in a low-ﬁeld seeking spin state can be
conﬁned in this ﬁeld, but will suﬀer losses due to non-
adiabatic spin ﬂip transitions near the line of zero ﬁeld.
These can be avoided using adiabatic, radio-frequency
(rf) induced potentials. A theoretical description was de-
veloped in [11, 12]. Resonant coupling between Zeeman
levels leads to a modiﬁcation of the dressed state energies,
producing local potential minima near positions where
the coupling ﬁeld is resonant with the atomic Larmor fre-
quency. As it was noted in [13] and recently discussed in
[14], the polarization of the ﬁelds must be taken into ac-
count. This important design parameter introduces new
possibilities. As Zeeman levels are coupled by circular rf
ﬁelds, we expand here on the earlier treatments.

For an atom with total angular momentum F , the
Hamiltonian in a weak magnetic ﬁeld can be approxi-
mated by H(t) = gF µB ˆF
B(t), with the Bohr mag-
·
neton µB and the Land´e factor gF . The magnetic ﬁeld
consists of a static contribution Bdc as given by the cir-
cular quadrupole ﬁeld (Fig. 1) plus an rf contribution
Brf (t) = Re[Brf exp(
iωt)]. In each point we take the
direction of the static ﬁeld as the local quantization axis,
Bdc = B0ˆe0.

The vector Brf is complex-valued and can be decom-
posed in a basis of orthonormal, spherical polarization
vectors (ˆe0, ˆe+, ˆe−), corresponding to π, σ+, and σ− po-
larizations, respectively: Brf = β0ˆe0 +β+ˆe+ +β−ˆe−. We
transform the Hamiltonian to a frame rotating about ˆe0
at the rf frequency ω and make the rotating wave approx-
imation (RWA) by neglecting remaining time-dependent
terms. The resulting eﬀective Hamiltonian in the rotat-
ing frame has the eigenvalues:

It is crucial that in the RWA only the σ+ ﬁeld compo-
nent (relative to the static ﬁeld) appears in the eﬀective
Hamiltonian.

For a ring-shaped quadrupole ﬁeld, the resonance con-
dition is met on a toroidal surface of constant ﬁeld mod-
ulus B0 = q r0 = ¯h ω/gF µB. In Fig. 2b) the trapping po-
tential along the z-direction at ρ = R is depicted. Atoms
can be trapped at the avoided crossings between dressed
energy levels, which occur on the surface of resonance.

The potential on the resonant surface is given by the
rf component β+, referenced to the local direction of
the static ﬁeld ˆe0.

the eﬀective quantum number mF changes sign and is un-
deﬁned at the ﬁeld zero. Atoms traversing this region can
undergo transitions to diﬀerent spin states. For negative Bz
the resonance frequency is also negative, inverting the rota-
tional sense of the required coupling ﬁeld.

In order to avoid level crossing, β+ must not vanish in
any point on the resonant surface. This can be ensured
by using a superposition of two global rf ﬁelds. The ﬁrst
is a spherical quadrupole ﬁeld, radially polarized along
ˆρ. The second is a uniform ﬁeld with linear ˆz polariza-
tion. Together these produce a cylindrically symmetric
ﬁeld, elliptically polarized in the ρ, z-planes. Denoting
its circular components in the ρ, z-plane by complex am-
plitudes a and b, it is expressed in global, cartesian coor-
dinates by:

be independent of r and ϕ. A special case is obtained for
a circular ﬁeld, a = 0 or b = 0. The potential, Eq. (5),
then becomes independent of both ϕ and θ, so the trap
extends over the entire toroidal surface, see Fig. 3a). This
opens up the possibility to trap cold atoms in a two-
dimensional, boundaryless geometry.

More generally, if neither a nor b vanishes, the ﬁeld
is elliptically polarized.
In this case, the potential has
minima for two poloidal angles. The trap thus splits

permanent magnetic material, and c > 30 µT. The sec-
ond requirement is that atomic collisions do not excite

In such a two-dimensional trap, the transition to
superﬂuidity is within reach.
In an inﬁnite system,
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition tempera-
ture is proportional to the atomic density: TBKT =
(π¯h2/2m kB) N/A [4, 5]. To achieve a high enough
transition temperature at reasonable atom numbers, the
4π2 R r0, has to be chosen as small
toroidal surface A
as possible. The minimal radius r0 depends on the static
ﬁeld gradient q and is given by Eq.(8). The radius R
cannot be chosen arbitrarily small as the circular rf am-
plitude a is limited by its radial quadrupole component.
We ﬁnd that it is favorable to use lower static ﬁeld gra-
q−1/3), but allows
dients q. This requires larger r0 (
for smaller R as it reduces the required rf amplitude a
q2/3). The limit to this strategy is given by the de-

we estimate the chemical potential to be well below the
trap frequency, g2d N/A < ¯h ωr. For an accurate de-
scription, the ﬁnite size of the system must be taken into
account. But as the poloidal circumference is still more
than 40 times longer than the healing length of the gas
ξ = ¯h/(2 m g2d n2d)1/2

parameters to be a good approximation for the crossover

As a second application we consider the possibilities for
controlling atomic motion by slowly varying and weakly
perturbing the rf ﬁelds. As the relative phase of a and b
controls the poloidal angle ϕ0 of the trap minima, a small
frequency diﬀerence between the two components can be
used to induce rotation of atoms around the quadrupole

So far we have assumed that the internal atomic state
adiabatically follows the external motion. This condition
is violated at points where the rf ﬁeld is resonant but the
coupling component β+ is too small. Such points, like the
zeroes in quadrupole magnetic traps, limit the trap life-
time, and have to be avoided. For example, for

the combination of a static ring-shaped quadrupole ﬁeld
with rf-ﬁelds of suitable polarizations. It enables studies
of low-dimensional gases with periodic boundary condi-
tions, creation of vortex loops, persistent currents and
solitons. Several rf frequencies can be used to create in-
dependently controlled, concentric atom shells, provid-
ing a tool for interferometric analysis, and for the cre-
ation of exotic lattices. The possibility to split the torus
into two rings with a dynamically tunable barrier enables
tunneling (Josephson oscillations) and squid type exper-
iments. Coherent splitting of matter-waves [13] together
with independent control of atomic motion in the split
rings makes this trap type particularly interesting for ro-
tation sensing [21].

to excite vortex loops that lie inside the toroidal surface.
It is also possible to produce and rotate trap minima
in the toroidal direction by additional ﬁelds. Split rings
can even be controlled independently from each other. As
an example, we discuss counter-rotating, vertically split
rings. After inducing such a splitting with B1, the rota-
tions can be introduced using a weaker, linearly polarized

Due to the direction of the static ﬁeld Bdc, these com-

of the torus, depending on their sense of rotation. On
the opposite side, they interfere with the cylindrical ﬁeld
B1, leading to maxima and minima along the toroidal
angle θ. As the direction of the interference is opposite

We note that the ﬁeld B2 can also be used to can-

ﬁeld. It is straightforward to show, that a cylindrical rf
ﬁeld produced by a straight central wire perpendicular

diﬀerence. Other possible means to compensate gravity
include electro-static or optical ﬁelds.

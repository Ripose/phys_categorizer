Abstract

We study the quantum description of parametric heating in harmonic po-
tentials both nonperturbatively and perturbatively, having in mind atom traps.
The ﬁrst approach establishes an explicit connection between classical and quan-
tum descriptions; it also gives analytic expressions for properties such as the
width of fractional frequency parametric resonances. The second approach gives
an alternative insight into the problem and can be directly extended to take into
account nonlinear eﬀects. This is specially important for shallow traps.

Introduction

Cooling techniques have allowed the trapping and manipulation of atoms by op-
tical means. Such systems are used to perform experimental tests of fundamen-
tal principles and have important applications, such as very precise frequency
standards or studies of cold atomic collisions or collective eﬀects. Fluctuations
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds used to trap or to modify the quantum state lead
to decoherence in ion traps [1] and limit the trap stability in, e. g., far–of–
resonance optical traps [2]. As a consequence, there has been, in recent years,
an increasing interest in understanding the dynamics of noise-induced heating
in atom traps.

In the harmonic model of the potential, ﬂuctuations manifest themselves as
either variations on the spring constant or on the equilibrium position. First
order perturbative studies [2, 3] of harmonic parametric heating yield similar
results to those classically expected: position noise is resonant at the vibrational
frequency ω0 leading to a constant heating rate, while intensity ﬂuctuations
are resonant at twice the vibrational frequency 2ω0 leading to an exponential
growth of the energy. Far-oﬀ-resonance optical traps are so sensitive to these
ﬂuctuations that parametric excitation has been used to accurately measure the
trap parameters [4, 5, 6].

There are other interesting phenomena predicted by the classical theory of
harmonic parametric excitation such as resonance eﬀects at fractional frequen-
cies [7]. They arise from intensity modulations of frequency 2ω0/n with n being
any integer number. The n = 2 resonance has actually been observed in FORT’s
10 have been classically studied in ion traps
[4, 5, 6] and resonances with n
[8].

≤

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the quantum description of paramet-
ric heating in harmonic potentials both nonperturbatively and perturbatively.
The ﬁrst treatment shows an explicit connection with the classical problem
which is valid only for harmonic potentials. It is based on well known algebraic
techniques [9].It explains observed features of parametric heating predicted both
classically and quantum mechanically. The second approach has the advantage
that it can be directly extended to anharmonic potentials. This is specially
important for shallow traps.

2.1 Time dependent equilibrium position

The eﬀective Hamiltonian that describes a harmonic oscillator with ﬂuctuations
in the trap equilibrium position is

where ǫq(t) measures such a ﬂuctuation. When the standard creation a† and

which guarantee the boundary condition (6). We are able, therefore, to evaluate
the time evolution of any physical quantity. For instance, it turns out that the
energy operator evolves as

If ǫq(t) is a ﬂuctuating ﬁeld, we are interested in averages over a time T short
compared with the time scale over which the measurable physical quantities
change, but large compared with the correlation time of the ﬂuctuations. Let

performed.

On the other hand, if one considers driven ﬂuctuations with a well speciﬁed
ǫq(t) instead of noise ﬁelds, the exact equation for the energy evolution (11) can
be used. For instance, if

In order to illustrate these ideas, the time evolution of the transition prob-
ability between the vacuum and the second excited state is shown in Fig. (1)
for ǫ0 = 0.05, and ω = ω0, i. e., the ﬁrst fractional resonance. We observe
that for ωt
1 the transition probability exhibits an approximately polynomial
growth. However, for longer times an oscillatory behavior arises. In Fig. (2),
we illustrate the energy evolution starting from vacuum state; we take the same
values for the parameters ω and ǫ0. An exponential growth superposed to the
oscillatory behavior of function φ(t), in Eq. (33), is found. The similarities be-

3 Perturbative approach to parametric heating.

The nonperturbative approach to parametric heating made in the last section
was useful to understand the connection between classical and quantum de-

scriptions of heating, due to either controlled or stochastic variations of the
parameters deﬁning a harmonic oscillator. Unfortunately, this approach is valid
only for quadratic potentials while nonlinear eﬀects may be determinant in ex-
periments with shallow conﬁning potentials [8, 14]. The purpose of this section
is to study some high order perturbative eﬀects due to variations on the strength
of a conﬁning potential. The resulting equations will be applied to a harmonic
oscillator but with a straightforward extension to anharmonic potentials. Be-
sides, this will allow us to understand fractional frequency resonances from an
alternative point of view.

4 Discussion and Outlook.

In this work, we have performed a perturbative and a nonperturbative analysis
of quantum parametric oscillators. The ﬁrst approach is based on standard al-
gebraic techniques and gives a direct connection between classical and quantum
results.
In the case of controlled driving terms of the form ǫ(t) = ǫ0 cos ωt,
the analytic solutions were used to evaluate time-dependent observables such as
the energy growth due to parametric heating. This is specially important for
far–oﬀ–resonance–traps (FORT’s) when the harmonic oscillator approximation
In that case, parametric heating is used as a technique to measure
is valid.
the characteristic frequency of the trap.
In such experiments, the fractional
frequency resonances are usually observed and it is clear, within our formal-
ism, how to perform their quantum description. In particular, using well known
results of the theory of Mathieu functions, it was shown how to evaluate the frac-
tional resonances width and how obtain explicit expressions for the exponential
growth of the energy.

The possibility of using the nonperturbative analysis to describe noise heat-
ing eﬀects is a subject that deserves more analysis. This idea has recently been
exploited [10] in the case of ﬂuctuations in the trap center. In the case of inten-
sity ﬂuctuations, the problem is more complicated since a rigorous description

An alternative would correspond to use solutions

of classical equa-
tions describing in an eﬀective way the coupling between the harmonic oscillator
and the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds. The usefulness of such an approach would be condi-
tioned by its ability to reproduce experimental eﬀects. For instance, classical
harmonic oscillators with an intensity variation ǫ(t) = ǫ0 cos ω′t and subject to
a damping force
γ ˙x lead to fractional frequency resonances only if ǫ0 is greater
than a certain threshold which depends on γ and the order of the resonance.
Such thresholds have been observed in the classical collective motion of ions in
Paul traps [8]. It would be expected that a similar phenomena occurs in the
quantum regime of motion. The experimental study of these thresholds could
be used to evaluate eﬀective damping eﬀects in atom traps.

In this paper, the perturbative analysis of heating induced by variations of
the intensity of a potential was studied in detail for a harmonic oscillator. This
analysis gave a diﬀerent insight into the problem. Fractional frequencies of order
n appear in n-th order perturbation theory. From the quantum theory point of
view, they are a direct consequence of: (i)the fact that the harmonic potential
has diagonal matrix elements
diﬀerent from zero; (ii) the equidistant

Figure 2.
Nonperturbative evolution of the energy of a time dependent harmonic os-
cillator of natural frequency ω0 in units of ¯hω0. The system is initially in the
vacuum state and the intensity time dependence is given by ǫ(t) = ǫ0 cos ωt,
ǫ0 = 0.05, ω = ω0, so that the ﬁrst fractional resonance condition is satisﬁed.
Superposed to the exponential growth, the oscillatory behavior of the function
φ(t) that appears in the Floquet solution to Mathieu equation is clearly mani-
fested.

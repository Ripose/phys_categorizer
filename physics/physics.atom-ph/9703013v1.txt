Abstract

We have investigated the threshold of photodetachment of Li− leading to the
formation of the residual Li atom in the 2p 2P state. The excited residual
atom was selectively photoionized via an intermediate Rydberg state and the
resulting Li+ ion was detected. A collinear laser-ion beam geometry enabled
both high resolution and sensitivity to be attained. We have demonstrated
the potential of this state selective photodetachment spectroscopic method
by improving the accuracy of Li electron aﬃnity measurements an order of
magnitude. From a ﬁt to the Wigner law in the threshold region, we obtained
a Li electron aﬃnity of 0.618 049(20) eV.

I. INTRODUCTION

The four-electron Li− ion is interesting because of the signiﬁcant role played by electron
correlation in the binding of the outermost electron in this weakly bound system. The
major contribution to the correlation energy arises from the interaction of the two valence
electrons. Beyond the three-body H− system, the Li− ion is most tractable to theory. In
the frozen core approximation, for example, the Li− ion becomes an eﬀective three-body
system consisting of a pair of highly correlated electrons interacting weakly with an inert
core. Such a model lends itself well to semi-empirical model potential calculations in which
the potential experienced by the valence electrons is obtained via spectral information on the
eigenvalue spectrum of the Li atom. Most calculations of the electron aﬃnity of Li to date
are of this type, e.g. Moccia et al. [1] or Graham et al. [2] (and references therein). Recently,
however, accurate measurements of this quantity have stimulated ab initio calculations [3,4]
of comparable accuracy.

The most direct, and potentially the most accurate, method of measuring electron aﬃni-
ties is to use the laser threshold photodetachment (LTP) method [5]. Here one records, as a
function of the wavelength of a tunable laser, the onset of production of either photoelectrons
or residual atoms in the vicinity of a detachment threshold.

To date, three LTP measurements of the electron aﬃnity of Li have been reported. The
earliest such experiment was a crossed laser and ion beam experiment by Feldman [6]. He
utilized an infrared laser to study the Li(2s) + ǫp photodetachment threshold. An accurate
threshold energy for a p-wave detachment was diﬃcult to determine because the cross section
rises, according to the Wigner law [7], only slowly from zero. Bae and Peterson [8] used
collinear laser and ion beams to investigate the total photodetachment cross section around
the Li(2p) cusp situated at the opening of the Li(2p) + ǫs channel. From a careful analysis of
this sharp structure they obtained, as one result, an electron aﬃnity value of about the same
accuracy as Feldman. The measurement of Dellwo et al. [9] was a direct investigation of the
resolved Li(2p) + ǫs channel threshold using photoelectron spectroscopy. In this experiment,
however, Doppler broadening associated with the use of crossed laser and ion beams limited
the attainable energy resolution.

The electron aﬃnity of Li determined in the present measurement is an order of mag-
nitude more accurate than previous LPT measurements. We utilized resonance ionization
[10,11] combined with a collinear laser-ion beam geometry to measure the threshold of the
Li(2p) + ǫs partial photodetachment cross section. The state selectivity of the resonance
ionization method leads to an excellent signal-to-background ratio. This in turn enabled us
to attain a resolution limited only by the laser bandwidth of about 0.2 cm−1. The present
threshold energy measurement clearly demonstrates the potential of the method. The con-
cept of combining collinear laser-ion beam spectroscopy with resonance ionization detection
was ﬁrst proposed by Kudriatsev and Letokhov [12] and later applied to isotope detection
measurements by the same authors [13]. Balling et al. [14] and Petrunin et al. [15] have
recently used the same technique in photodetachment measurements.

A. Procedure

The two-color state selective photodetachment experiment described in the present paper
is simple in concept. One laser of frequency ω1 is used to photodetach Li− ions producing
an excited Li atom and a free electron (Fig. 1). A second laser of frequency ω2 resonantely
photoexcites Li atoms left in the 2p state to a Rydberg state which subsequently is ﬁeld
ionized. Hence, the entire process can be represented by the following steps:

atom in either a ns or nd state. State selectivity is accomplished in the resonant ionization
step since only Li(2p) atoms can be ionized via the intermediate Rydberg state.
In this
manner we were able to isolate a particular photodetachment channel, in this case the
Li(2p) channel, and investigate the partial photodetachment cross section by measuring the
yield of Li+ ions.

B. Setup

The 7Li− ion beam was produced by charge exchange in a cesium vapor cell of a mass
selected Li+ beam from a plasma ion source. An ion current of typically a few nA was
obtained in the interaction region. The beam energy was approximately 4 keV.

In the interaction chamber (Fig. 2) the negative ions interacted with laser light in a
region deﬁned by two apertures with a diameter of 3 mm placed 0.5 m apart. The ions were
deﬂected in and out of the laser beam by means of two electrostatic quadrupole deﬂectors
whose symmetry axes were perpendicular to the laser and ion beams. The ion current in the
interaction region was monitored with a Faraday cup placed after the second quadrupole
deﬂector.

Rydberg atoms formed in the interaction region travel to the second quadrupole where
they are ionized by the same electric ﬁeld that deﬂects the negative ion beam into the
Faraday cup. Positive ions formed in this process were deﬂected in the opposite direction into
a positive ion detector. In this detector the fast positive ions impinged on a conducting glass
plate producing secondary electrons that were detected with a channel electron multiplier

4

(CEM). A metal grid connected to a voltage supply was placed between the glass plate and
the CEM. This made it possible to either allow or prevent the secondary electrons from
reaching the CEM. The detection eﬃciency of the positive ion detector was close to unity.

Ion- and laser beams were merged in the interaction region between the quadrupole deﬂectors over
a common path of 0.5 m.

Light of frequency ω1 was generated by a dye laser operated with Coumarine 307 and
light of frequency ω2 was produced by a dye laser operated with BMQ. Both dye lasers
were pumped by a common XeCl excimer laser. The pulse duration of both lasers was
about 15 ns. The maximum energy in a laser pulse delivered into the interaction region
was 1.5 mJ for the radiation of frequency ω1 and 200 µJ for the radiation of frequency ω2.
During the experiment both lasers were attenuated, as will be discussed below.

The two laser pulses counter propagated in the interaction region and arrived simultane-
ously in the interaction region. A shift of a few ns between the pulses, occurring at both ends
of the interaction region, is negligible since the Li(2p 2P ) radiative lifetime is 26.99(16) ns
[16].

The frequency ω1 was determined by combining Fabry-P´erot fringes with optogalvanic
spectroscopy. The Fabry-P´erot fringes served as frequency markers whereas transitions of
Ne or Ar in a hollow cathode lamp provided an absolute calibration of the energy scale.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Resonance ionization spectroscopy

First we had to ﬁnd an appropriate resonance transition for the laser of frequency ω2. A
scan of ω2, during which ω1 is set to a frequency far above the Li(2p) threshold, is shown in
Fig. 3. Below the ionization limit we found a wealth of lines. Due to strong saturation, the
intensities of the lines are not

proportional to the corresponding transition probabilities; close to the ionization limit
the detection system became overloaded such that it only recorded one count per laser shot
thus attenuating the strongest lines. For most of the lines we also expect the transition itself
to be saturated. The Rydberg series in Fig. 3 exhibits a cut oﬀ at 28 270 cm−1 indicating
that the Rydberg atoms were mainly ﬁeld ionized in an electric ﬁeld of about 200 kV/m in
the second quadrupole deﬂector. We interpret the lines below the cut oﬀ as being due to
photoionization.

A detailed scan of the transition used for the photodetachment threshold measurements
is shown in Fig. 4. We identiﬁed the two lines as corresponding to transitions from the
two ﬁne structure levels 2p 2P1/2,3/2 to the same Rydberg state. The measured separation
of 0.33(4) cm−1 between the two lines in Fig. 4 corresponds very well to the ﬁne structure
splitting of 0.337 cm−1 of the 2p 2P term [17].

The resolved ﬁne structure shown in Fig. 4 demonstrates that the energy resolution of
the present collinear beam apparatus is approximately 0.2 cm−1, which is of the same order
as the laser bandwidth.

cross-section of Li− around the Li(2p) threshold with anti-parallel laser (of frequency ω1) and

error bars on selected data points represent the shot noise. Notice the very steep onset of the
photodetachment and the low background below the threshold. Each data point is obtained from
100 laser pulses.

B. Electron aﬃnity measurements

A typical measurement of the Li(2p) photodetachment threshold with anti-parallel laser
and ion beams is shown in Fig. 5. The laser frequency ω2 was held constant and the intensity
was set to saturate the transition to the Rydberg state. The frequency ω1 was then scanned
over the Li(2p) threshold.

It was established that two processes contributed to the background, namely (a):

Li

(2s2 1S) + ¯hω2 → Li(2p 2P ) + e− ,
Li(2p 2P ) + ¯hω2 → Li(ns, nd) ,

Li(ns, nd) ; Li+(1s2 1S) + e− ,

and (b) two-electron collisional ionization. Process (a) produced nearly 80% of the back-
ground, even though the intensity of the laser light with frequency ω2 was attenuated.
Process (b), two-electron collisional ionization, contributed the remaining background at
the operating pressure of 5 × 10−9 mbar (5 × 10−7 Pa). This contribution was found to be
proportional to the pressure and is thus dominated by single collision double detachment,
as has been discussed previously by Bae and Peterson [18].

The laser intensities were too low for other processes, such as direct two-electron multi-

photon detachment, to inﬂuence the experiment.

Close to the photodetachment threshold the cross section σ(E) is well represented by the
Wigner law [7] (Eq. 2). If E0 is the threshold energy and E the photon energy, the Wigner
law for electrons detached with diﬀerent angular momenta l can be written as

σ(E) ∝

E − E0

,

for E ≥ E0 .

(cid:19)

For the desired ﬁrst step process in Eq. 1, both s- and d-wave ﬁnal states for the detached
electron are allowed by parity and total angular momentum conservation. At the threshold,
however, the s-wave cross section, starting with an inﬁnite slope, completely dominates over
the d-wave cross section.

We ﬁtted the Wigner law (Eq. 2) for s-wave detachment (l = 0) to the recorded positive
ion signal. The data shown in Fig. 5 was recorded with the laser (ω1) anti-parallel to the
ion beam. The ﬁt window is the range of the plotted line. The ﬁt yields a value for the
red-shifted threshold energy, Er
0 . In order to eliminate the Doppler shift we repeated the
measurements using parallel laser and ion beams to determine the blue-shifted threshold
energy, Eb

geometric mean of the two measurements:

The interaction of the induced dipole moment of the atom with the electron will limit the
range of validity of the Wigner law. O’Malley [19] obtained an expression which accounts
for the residual induced-dipole point-charge interaction,

where k =
approximate range of validity for the Wigner law by determining the conditions under which
the second term, and therefore higher terms, become negligible. With a dipole polarizibility
of α = 152 a.u. for the Li 2p 2P state [20], the second term is much less than unity up to
1 cm−1 above the threshold, and consequently the Wigner law should be applicable over
this range. This, of course, assumes that there are no resonances in this region, a condition
which has been previously established by Dellwo et al. [9].

Saturation of the signal can originate in the photodetachment process or the detection

suﬃciently to avoid any saturation of the signal within the ﬁrst 1.0 cm−1 above the threshold.

corrected threshold energy E0 (Eq. 3).
We determined the Li electron aﬃnity to be 4 984.90(17) cm−1. To the error there are
two major contributions: 0.13 cm−1 is due to a calibration uncertainty of the hollow cathode
lamps, and the rest is due to statistical scattering of the ﬁtted threshold values.

In order to convert our electron aﬃnity in cm−1 to eV we used the recommended factor
of (1/8 065.5410) [eV/(cm−1)] [21] and obtained 0.618 049(20) eV. In Fig. 6 this value is
compared with previous experiments. These values are also compiled in Tab. I together
with some recently calculated Li electron aﬃnities.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that photodetachment spectroscopy combined with resonance
ionization is a powerful method for studying partial photodetachment cross sections of neg-
ative ions. The collinear beam geometry simultaneously provides high sensitivity, due to
the large interaction volume, and excellent resolution, due to velocity compression. I ad-
dition, removal of the Doppler shift to all orders can be achieved by use of two separate
measurements involving parallel and anti-parallel laser and ion beams. Both merits can be
fully retained for channel speciﬁc photodetachment investigations with the excitation scheme
used in this experiment. Our improved Li electron aﬃnity of 0.618 049(20) eV reveals the
potential of this method, and this method can, in principle, be extended to essentially all
elements.

We are currently developing this type of state-selective detection scheme in connection

with on-going studies of high lying doubly excited states of the Li− ion [22].

Abstract

We present lifetime measurements of the 7S1/2 level and the 6p manifold of

Rb. We use a time-correlated single-photon counting technique on a sample

of 85Rb atoms conﬁned and cooled in a magneto-optical trap. The upper state

of the 5P1/2 repumping transition serves as the resonant intermediate level

for two-photon excitation of the 7s level. A probe laser provides the second

step of the excitation, and we detect the decay of the atomic ﬂuorescence to

the 5P3/2 level at 741 nm. The decay process feeds the 6p manifold which

decays to the 5s ground state emitting uv photons. We measure lifetimes

of 88.07

Introduction

The lifetime of an excited level and its hyperﬁne splitting are properties related to the elec-

tronic wavefunctions of the atom. The lifetime, through the matrix elements of allowed

transitions, probes the wavefunctions at large radius, while the hyperﬁne splitting samples

their value at the nucleus. The comparison of the two types of measurements with theo-

retical predictions test the quality of the computed wavefunctions. The calculation of the

wavefunctions have now reached new levels of sophistication1,2 based on Many Body Pertur-

bation Theory (MBPT). Those calculations are particularly important in the interpretation

of precision tests of discrete symmetries in atoms: Parity Non-Conservation (PNC) (see for

example the Cs measurements of Wood et al.3,4) and Time Reversal (TR).5

This paper presents our measurements on 85Rb atoms in a magneto-optic trap (MOT)

using time-correlated single-photon counting techniques. We measure the lifetimes of the

7s 2S1/2 level and the 6p manifold as well as the hyperﬁne splitting of the 7s 2S1/2 level. The

work complements and aids our program of Fr spectroscopy and weak interaction physics.6

We carry out all the Fr measurements in a trapped and cooled atomic gas. Rb and Fr have

very similar properties and the same trap can be used to capture either of them by selecting

the appropriate wavelengths.7 Having the ability to trap both atoms helps us understand

better our experimental results. The trap is optimized for Fr and it works on-line with

the Superconducting LINAC at Stony Brook. Our Rb measurements are necessary to fully

understand the systematic eﬀects on our measurements of the equivalent levels in Fr, 9s, 8p.8,9

The Rb measurements presented here are an important test of MBPT calculations in

a regime where relativistic eﬀects are not as important as in heavier atoms such as Fr.

Measurements of excited state atomic lifetimes in the low-lying states of the s and p man-

ifolds enhance our understanding of the wavefunctions and the importance of correlation

3

corrections in their calculation.

The paper is structured as follows: We present the lifetime measurements in section 2,

detail the hyperﬁne splitting measurement in section 3, and summarize the work in the

context of similar measurements in Rb and Fr in section 4.

2. Lifetime measurements

A. Lifetime and matrix elements

The lifetime of a quantum mechanical system depends on the initial and ﬁnal states wave-

functions and the dominant interaction. Since the electromagnetic interaction in atomic

physics is well understood, radiative lifetimes provide information on atomic structure.

The lifetime τ of an excited state is related to the partial lifetimes τi associated with each

of the allowed decay channels by:

The calculation of the radial matrix elements requires the wavefunctions of the initial and

ﬁnal states involved in the decay. The contributions of the wavefunction at large distance

become more important due to the presence of the radial operator. Knowledge of the

4

atomic lifetimes and branching ratios in Rb will determine the radial matrix elements for

the transitions.

B. Sample preparation

We use a high eﬃciency magneto-optical trap (MOT) to capture a sample of Rb atoms

at a temperature lower than 300 µK.7 We load the MOT from a Rb vapor produced by

a dispenser in a glass cell coated with a dry ﬁlm. The MOT consists of three pairs of

retro-reﬂected beams, each with 15 mW/cm2 intensity, 6 cm diameter (1/e2 intensity) and

red detuned 19 MHz from the atomic resonance. A pair of coil generates a magnetic ﬁeld

gradient of 6 G/cm. We trap 105 atoms, with a diameter of 0.2 mm and a typical lifetime

between 5 and 10 s.

Figure 1 shows the energy levels of 85Rb relevant for the trap, lifetime and hyperﬁne

splitting measurements. The trapping and cooling are done with a Coherent 899-21 titanium-

sapphire (ti-sapph) laser at 780 nm between the 5S1/2 F = 3 and the 5P3/2 F = 4 levels.

We repump the atoms that fall out of the cycling transition with a Coherent 899-01 ti-sapph

laser at 795 nm between the 5S1/2 F = 2 and the 5P1/2 F = 3 levels. A Coherent 899-21 ti-

sapph at 728 nm, the probe laser, completes the two photon transition. We use a depumper

pulse at 780 nm between the 5S1/2 F = 3 and the 5P3/2 F = 3 levels before the two photon

transition to take the atoms out of the cycling transition and into the lower hyperﬁne ground

state.

The atoms in the trap are excited to the 7s level using a two photon transition through

the 5P1/2 level. To increase the population transfer to the 7s level we split the repumper

light into two paths, one going directly to the trap with a large beam size to optimize the

trapping eﬃciency and combining the other with the depumper and probe laser focused on

the trap to optimize the excitation. We send 12 mW of probe power, 9 µW of depumper

5

power and 2 mW of repumper power focused to a spot size between 1 and 3 mm to increase

the excitation intensity.

Figure 2 shows the schematic of the laser system. We control the power of the lasers going

into the trap with acousto-optic modulators (AOM) and electro-optic modulators (EOM).

We measure the wavelength of the lasers with a wavemeter (Burleigh WV-1500). We lock

the trap laser to 85Rb using saturation spectroscopy. We avoid long term frequency drifts

on the probe and repumper lasers by transferring the long term stability of a He-Ne laser

to the two lasers via a computer controlled scanning Fabry-Perot cavity.11

The 7s level has four diﬀerent electric dipole (E1) allowed decay channels as shown in

Fig. 3. We detect the direct decay channel from the 7s to the 5P3/2 at 741 nm to obtain the

lifetime of the 7s level. The 7s level can also decay to the 6p level and from there cascade

down to the 5s level emitting a photon at 420 (or 422) nm in this last step. We collect the

ﬂuorescence at 420 (or 422) nm that contains contributions from the lifetime of the 7s and

6p levels. Using the results obtained for the lifetime of the 7s level we can extract a lifetime

for the 6p manifold.

C. Experimental method

We use the technique of time-correlated single-photon counting to measure the lifetimes.12

This method has been used in the past to measure lifetimes of atoms in beams,13 vapor

cells14 and single ions.15 Our group has used it to measure the lifetime of the 7p, 7d and 9s

levels in Fr8,9,16,17 and of the 5p levels in Rb.16

The cycle of the measurement has a repetition rate of 100 kHz controlled with a Berke-

ley Nucleonics Corporation BNC 8010 pulse generator and two Stanford Research Systems

DG535 pulse delay generators as shown in Fig. 4. The cycle starts with 0.7 µs for state

preparation. To do this we ﬁrst take the atoms out of the cycling transition and into the

6

lower hyperﬁne ground level with a depumper beam at 780 nm between the 5S1/2 F = 3 and

the 5P3/2 F = 3 level, (a) in Fig. 1. Once there, the atoms are excited with the repumper

laser to the 5P1/2 F = 3 level, (b) in Fig. 1, and from there the probe laser takes them to

the 7S1/2 F = 3 level, (c) in Fig. 1. We detect ﬂuorescence for 1.6 µs while the counting

gate is on while keeping all the lasers oﬀ during the last 1.3 µs. We use the rest of the

cycle (8 µs) for cooling and trapping of atoms. At the beginning of the cycle we turn oﬀ

the trap laser with an acousto-optic modulator (AOM)(Crystal Technology 3200-144). The

trap beam is focused to a transverse line in the AOM with a cylindrical lens telescope to

avoid damage to the crystal while maintaining a large diﬀraction eﬃciency. This gives a

10:1 on/oﬀ ratio for the trap laser in 260 ns. We allow an extra 240 ns to increase the on/oﬀ

ratio for the trap laser before we excite the atoms to the 7s level for 200 ns. We turn oﬀ the

probe with two electro-optic modulators (EOM)(Gs¨anger LM0202) and an AOM (Crystal

Technology 3200-144). The two EOM’s give a fast turn oﬀ for the probe laser and the AOM

improves the long term on/oﬀ ratio. The turn oﬀ of the probe laser can be approximated

with a half Gaussian function with a FWHM of 7 ns. We obtain an on/oﬀ ratio of 600:1

after 20 ns. The fast turn oﬀ of the EOM’s creates strong radio frequency (RF) emission.

The photomultiplier tube (PMT) ampliﬁers can pick this emission and create false detection

pulses. We minimize these false events by enclosing the EOMs and drivers inside a metallic

cage in a separate room. Another AOM (Crystal Technologies 3200-144) turns oﬀ the re-

pumper simultaneously with the probe. We look for ﬂuorescence from the 7s level and the

6p manifold for 1.3 µs. We turn the trapping beams back on for the rest of the cycle and

then repeat the entire cycle continuously for the duration of the measurement.

A 1:1 imaging system (f/3.9) collects the ﬂuorescence photons onto a charge coupled

device (CCD) camera (Roper Scientiﬁc, MicroMax 1300YHS-DIF). We monitor the trap

7

with the use of an interference ﬁlter at 780 nm in front of the camera. A beam-splitter in

the imaging system sends 50% of the light onto a PMT (Hamamatsu R636). An interference

ﬁlter at 741 nm in front of the PMT reduces the background light other than ﬂuorescence

from the 7S1/2 to the 5P3/2 level. Another independent 1:1 imaging system (f/3.5) monitors

the ﬂuorescence from the 6p manifold to the 5S1/2 level with the use of an interference ﬁlter

at 420 nm (10 nm bandwidth at 50%) and a PMT (Amperex XP 2020Q).

Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the electronics used in the detection and processing

of 7s and 6p photon events. The heart of the electronics is the time-to-amplitude converter

(TAC) (Ortec 467 for the 7s photons and Ortec 437 for the 6p photons). The TAC receives

an start and an stop pulse and outputs a voltage proportional to the time separation between

pulses. The pulse generator used to control the timing of the lasers provides the stop pulse

at a ﬁxed delay from the lasers turn oﬀ. A detected ﬂuorescence photon provides the start

pulse. Only one photon can be processed per cycle. The photon pulse generated by the

PMT goes through some processing before reaching the TAC. It ﬁrst goes through an Ortec

AN106/N ampliﬁer and then to an Ortec 934 constant fraction discriminator (CFD). The

output of the discriminator is a pulse of ﬁxed shape with a constant time delay from the

input pulse. The pulse then goes through a linear gate (Ortec LG101/N) which is open

only during the excitation and ﬂuorescence part of the cycle. Starting the TAC with a

ﬂuorescence photon eliminates the cycles with no detected photons. An histogram of the

output of the TAC in a multichannel analyzer (MCA) (EG&G Trump-8k for the 7s photons

and Canberra 3502 for the 6p photons) displays the exponential decay directly in real-time.

We calibrate the MCA by replacing the start pulse given by the PMT with an electronic

pulse generated by the pulse generator. We change the separation between the start and

stop pulses in steps of 100 ns and ﬁt the resulting signal to ﬁnd both the linearity and

8

calibration. We verify the uniformity of the MCA channels by triggering the PMT with

random photon events from room light. The result is a uniformly ﬂat signal consistent with

zero slope.

D.

7s level analysis

We measure the lifetime of the 7s level through its decay to the 5P3/2 level. We keep the

number of atoms in the trap low (about 105) to reduce density related eﬀects (diameter

of the trap

0.2 mm). We operate with the number of detected photons per cycle to be

∼

much smaller than one. We apply a small correction to the data to account for preferential

counting of early events.12 This correction appears when we have more than one photon per

cycle. The correction, called pulse pileup correction, is given by

Ni is the number of counts in channel i of the MCA, nE is the total number of cycles,
′
i is the corrected number of counts for channel i. We typically get one count every

100 cycles (or 1 ms), which corresponds to a correction smaller than 1% in the number of

counts per channel.

Figure 6 shows the exponential decay obtained for a 47 minute accumulation along with

the ﬁt and residuals. For times before -200 ns the small signal comes from the trapping

laser light leakage through the interference ﬁlter. Between t=-200 ns and t=0 ns we turn

on the excitation beams (probe and depumper) which gives the fast rise and plateau on

the signal coming both from the fuorescence of the atoms and the leakage from the two

additional lasers, after t=0 ns we turn all the laser beams oﬀ and the only light remaining

is the fuorescence from the atoms. The ﬁt starts 20 ns after the beams turn oﬀ and stops

when the signal is equal to the background. The ﬁtting function is

9

S7s = cae−t/τ + cb + cmt,

(4)

with t the time (or channel number) and τ and ci (i = a, b, m) the ﬁtting constants. We

obtain a background signal by repeating the experiment without atoms. The lifetime ﬁt is

aﬀected slightly by the presence of a linear background that we include in the ﬁt. The slope

of the background is about 2 counts per 1000 channels per 1000 seconds of accumulation

and comes from the slow turn oﬀ of the trap laser. This particular decay has a reduced

ν of 1.07, where the noise in the number of counts is statistical (√S). A discrete Fourier
χ2

transform of the residuals shows no structure.

1. Systematic eﬀects

We search for systematic eﬀects by varying one experimental parameter at a time and

looking for an eﬀect on the obtained lifetime. Each measurement lasts for about 3000 s. We

study ﬁrst the eﬀects that the external variables have on the lifetime. Each measurement

is obtained under slightly diﬀerent conditions. We ﬁt them independently using the ﬁtting

function of Eq. 4 and make a correlation study between the obtained lifetime and the

external variable for each case.

Excitation pulse duration. We change the excitation pulse duration between 100 and

800 ns. The lifetime is independent of the initial conditions of the decay. Changing the

pulse duration can modify the initial conditions for the decay.

Probe intensity. We vary the probe intensity over a factor of ten. This is another way

in which we can modify the initial conditions for the decay.

Magnetic ﬁeld. The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld from the MOT may inﬂuence the

measured lifetime mainly through quantum beats between the Zeeman sublevels. We change

the magnetic ﬁeld gradient from 4 to 7 Gauss/cm.

10

Number of atoms. We change the number of atoms from 6

104 to 1

107. Increasing

×

×

the number of atoms will increase the density and produce more collisions between the atoms

as well as permit radiation trapping. These two eﬀects will modify the lifetime. The photon

detection rate also increases with the atom number. This rate becomes too high for the

electronics of the MCA and the repetition rate for the experiment has to be reduced to 10

kHz, with a larger pulse pile-up correction.

We quantify the correlation between the measured lifetime and the external variables by

calculating the linear correlation coeﬃcient. The integral of the probability distribution as-

sociated with the linear correlation coeﬃcient provides the degree of correlation of the data

with the external variable. An small value for the integral probability means signiﬁcant

correlation. In all of the above cases the integral probability of the linear correlation coef-

ﬁcient is larger than 5%, consistent with no correlation. We keep the number of atoms low

for all the measurements to avoid systematic eﬀects related to collisions or to pulse pile-up.

Radiation trapping can be ignored due to the small population in the 5P3/2 level.

Other eﬀects can inﬂuence the measurement but they are not related to a simple variable

as above. In this case we make a reference measurement and then we modify something

to test each one of the above potential eﬀects to obtain another measurement. We ﬁt each

independent data ﬁle using Eq. 4 and perform an χ2 test to the obtained lifetimes to ﬁnd

out if they are consistent with statistical ﬂuctuations.

Repumper turn oﬀ. We look for an eﬀect of an imperfect turn oﬀ of the repumper

light by leaving the repumper on continuously. The repumper is used as the ﬁrst step of the

two photon transition and when combined with an imperfect turn-oﬀ of the probe laser it

can introduce a false signal.

Hyperﬁne level. To our accuracy level, the lifetime should be independent of the

11

hyperﬁne level. We change the initial hyperﬁne level of the decay, that is, instead of preparing

the atoms in the 7S1/2 F = 3 state we prepare them in the 7S1/2 F = 2 state.

Electronics. We look for eﬀects related to the electronic components by interchanging

the MCA for the 7s and 6p detection systems. It is important to keep the Canberra MCA

count rate low.

Probe turn oﬀ. An imperfect extinction of the probe laser will show up as an excess in

the initial data points of the decay. This eﬀect can be revealed by changing the initial/ﬁnal

point for the ﬁt. The spread of the lifetimes as a function of the starting point of the ﬁt is

consistent with the statistical uncertainty. There is no dependence on the ﬁnal point for the

ﬁt within our statistical precision.

consistent with statistical ﬂuctuations.

All the above measurements give an integral probability for the χ2 between 5% and 95%,

Trap displacement. We displace the trap keeping the magnetic ﬁeld ﬁxed, such that the

atoms are sampling a diﬀerent magnetic environment. To move the trap position we insert a

piece of glass in front of one of the retro-reﬂection mirrors in the MOT. We repeat the same

procedure for the three retro-reﬂection mirrors in the MOT. The MOT image on the camera

shows trap displacements smaller than one trap diameter in the transversal direction to the

camera and we have no information on the longitudinal displacement. This is a complex

systematic eﬀect since it involves the change of several experimental parameters such as

the alignment of the excitation lasers. This makes it diﬃcult to assign a single parameter

responsible for the variations we observe. We tried diﬀerent combinations of moving the trap

with and without realignment. The integral probability of the χ2 shows ﬂuctuations larger

than statistical. We include an uncertainty contribution of

0.38%, equal to the dispersion

±

of the lifetime values (Fig. 7).

12

Quantum beats. We look for quantum beats in the residuals of the ﬁt. A discrete

Fourier transform of the residuals shows no structure. The value of

0.1% quoted for the

±

uncertainty due to quantum beats comes from a theoretical calculation with a simple model

which assumes well deﬁned Zeeman sublevels as in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld.

The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld gradient further reduces the quantum beat contribution.

Some of the information obtained can be extended to measurements in Fr. Changing the

number of atoms is complicated in Fr so we can use the results for Rb to know if we are

working in a good regime. Both atoms have similar atomic structure, so most tests should

give similar results. The most important diﬀerence is their sensitivity to magnetic eﬀects

because of the diﬀerence in multiplicity of Zeeman sublevels and hyperﬁne separation.

2. Result and comparison with theory

The average of the reduced χ2

ν of the individual ﬁles is 1.04

0.08. The diﬀerent lifetimes

±

from the ﬁt are averaged to obtain the ﬁnal result. The lifetime of the 7s level is 88.07

0.38

±

ns. A ﬁt to the ﬁle resulting from adding all the ﬁles gives consistent results. Table 1

summarizes the error budget for the experiment.

Figure 8 is a comparison of our result with theoretical predictions18,19 for the lifetime

of the 7s level, as well as previous measurements.20,21 Theoretical calculations are reaching

a level of precision below 1%.22 An experimental veriﬁcation of this precision is important

to increase the conﬁdence in such calculations. This information is crucial to extract weak

interaction physics out of parity non-conservation experiments. The prediction from ab

initio calculations for the 7s level lifetime is 88.3 ns.18 The agreement shows the remarkable

level of sophistication of atomic structure calculations.

13

E.

6p level analysis

The 7s level has the four decay channels shown in Fig. 3. We detect the indirect decay

from the 6p to the 5s levels to obtain information about the 6p level. The atoms decaying

from the 6p level come from a cascade decay from the 7s level and the decay cannot be

described with a single exponential. The signal from this indirect decay is the sum of three

exponential functions with lifetimes corresponding to the 7S1/2, 6P1/2 and 6P3/2 levels. We

can make use of the result obtained in the previous section for the lifetime of the 7S1/2 level

to measure the lifetime of the 6p manifold. Here we present the analysis of the 6p signal that

contains contributions from the two ﬁne levels. The ﬁne separation of the 6p levels in Rb is

1.4 nm which is smaller than the 10 nm transmission width of the interference ﬁlter. In the

case of Fr, the ﬁne separation of the corresponding levels is larger and we use interference

ﬁlters to resolve both contributions seperately.8,9

The lifetimes of the two ﬁne 6p levels are expected to be similar. We assume that the

decay signal is given by the sum of two exponential functions, one for the 7s level and the

other for the 6p level, so that the ﬁtting function is

S6p = Ab + A7se−t/τ7s + A6pe−t/τ6p ,

(5)

where τ7s is the lifetime of the 7s level obtained in the previous section, and τ6p, Ab, A7s

and A6p are the ﬁtting constants. Fig. 9 shows the signal obtained for a single ﬁle and the

resulting curve if we subtract the background and the exponential contribution from the 7s

level. This last curve corresponds to the exponential decay of the 6p manifold. We only use

ﬁles with low count rates to avoid systematic eﬀects associated with the slow response of

the MCA.

The lifetime we obtain for the 6p manifold depends on the value of the lifetime of the 7s

14

level. The uncertainty in the 7s lifetime inﬂuences the precision with which we can extract

the 6p lifetime. The probability distribution for τ6p is given by

The integrand contains two Gaussian distributions, the ﬁrst one gives the probability dis-

tribution for 7s level lifetime centered on τ7s with an uncertainty σ7s and the second one

gives the probability distribution for the 6p manifold lifetime centered on τ6p(τ ′) with an

uncertainty σ6p(τ ′). We assume a value τ ′ for the lifetime of τ7s and include that in the

ﬁtting function (Eq. 5) to obtain a value for τ6p(τ ′). We repeat the same procedure for

diﬀerent values of τ ′ and perform the integral of Eq. 6.

The result for the integral when τ6p and σ6p do not strongly depend on τ ′ gives ap-

proximately τ6p = τ6p(τ7s) = 120.7 ns and σ6p =

ual ﬁles used on the ﬁt but includes the spread brought by systematic checks on the 7s level

lifetime. The uncertainty in the MCA calibration is at the 0.94% level. Table 2 summarizes

the error budget that gives a ﬁnal result for the lifetime of the 6p manifold of 120.7

1.2 ns.

1. Simple model

We can make a comparison between the predicted and the measured signal to give some

where Ni and τi give the population and lifetime respectively of level i, with i = s, p1, p3

representing the 7S1/2, 6P1/2 and 6P3/2 levels, and Bp1 = 0.132, Bp3 = 0.255 the theoretical

branching ratios from the 7S1/2 level to the 6P1/2 and 6P3/2 respectively.18 To solve this

equations we need the initial conditions for the level populations at the beginning of the

decay (or equivalently at the end of the excitation pulse). Fig. 6 shows that during the

excitation the population of the 7s level reaches an steady state very fast. We will assume

the 7s population to be constant during the excitation pulse. We also assume that before the

excitation we have no population in the 6p level. With these assumptions we can calculate

the population of the 6p levels during the excitation given by

The excitation lasts for T =200 ns, so evaluating these expressions after this time will give

the initial conditions for the decay. Solving Eq. 7 with these initial conditions gives the

population of the three levels as a function of time. The signal measured by the PMT is

proportional to the sum of the decay rates of each of the 6p levels to the 5s level. The

underlying assumption that the response of the PMT and the interference ﬁlter is the same

for both of the 6p levels is reasonable due to the small energy separation between them (1.4

nm). The signal (

The two expressions above will be equal in the least squares sense, meaning that we will

the equation in the range from 0 to

are τp1 = 129 ns, τp3 = 118 ns.18 Using these values we get the following expression for the

we obtain A6p/A7s =

obtained is 12%.

We can invert the previous procedure to set limits on the possible values of the 6p ﬁne

level lifetimes. If we take τ ′

6p equal to the experimental value (or some other value) we can

17

only obtain that value with speciﬁc combinations of τp1 and τp3. This will not ﬁx either

τp1 or τp3, but it will create a functional relation between the two. Fig. 10 gives the 1σ

and 2σ bands for the experimental result using the described method with the branching

ratios assumed to be constant. The theoretical predictions are also included in the ﬁgure

and the ab initio calculation18 is in agreement with the experimental result that includes

the statistical and calibration uncertainty.

3. Hyperﬁne splitting

A. Hyperﬁne splitting and matrix elements

The hyperﬁne splitting in an atom is produced by the interaction of the electrons with the

nuclear magnetic moment. The hyperﬁne splitting constant for an s state is given by23

A =

8π

µ0µB
4πh

2gµN |

2κ,

(12)

where µ0 is the magnetic constant, µB is the Bohr magneton, µN is the nuclear magneton,

g is the nuclear g-factor and κ is a correction term that includes the relativistic correction,

the Breit correction and the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect.

The hyperﬁne splitting constant works as a probe for the magnetic environment created

by the electrons at the nucleus. Measurements of the hyperﬁne splitting will tests the

wavefunctions at short distances.

The experimental setup used for the lifetime measurements gives the ﬂexibility to reach

both of the 7s hyperﬁne levels. We have a clean detection method for the number of atoms

promoted to the 7s level through the ﬂuorescence photons from the 7s level or from the

6p manifold. In this section we present the results for the measurement of the hyperﬁne

splitting of the 7s level.

18

B. Experimental method

We measure the hyperﬁne splitting of the 7s state by scanning the frequency of the probe

laser and counting the number of photons as a function of frequency. The excitation se-

quence corresponds to the one used for the lifetime measurement with the excitation pulse

length increased to 1.5 µs. We monitor the wavelength of the probe laser with a wavemeter

(Burleigh WV-1500) that has a resolution of

30 MHz. We improve the meaurement reso-

±

lution with a Fabry-Perot cavity which acts as a frequency ruler. We send the probe laser

and a frequency stabilized Melles-Griot He-Ne laser (05-STP-901) into a Fabry-Perot cavity

that is constantly scanning. We detect and digitize the transmitted intensity. A computer

monitors the position of the transmission peak of the probe laser relative to two transmission

peaks of the He-Ne laser. Using this method we control the drift of our lasers to less than

1 MHz per hour.11

As we scan the probe laser, its relative position with respect to the He-Ne peaks will

change and may even move to a neighboring free spectral range. Knowledge of the free

spectral range of the cavity gives us a ruler to measure frequency diﬀerences.

We calibrate the cavity with an EOM (New Focus 4002) driven with a signal generator

(Giga-tronics 1026) to add sidebands of known frequency to the probe laser before it enters

the cavity. We select the probe laser frequency equal to one of the hyperﬁne levels and the

frequency driving the EOM about half of the hyperﬁne splitting, such that the second order

sideband is close to the other hyperﬁne level. A scan of the sideband frequency around this

value gives a local cavity calibration to

0.42 MHz.

±

The method for detection of ﬂuorescence photons is the same as the one used for the

lifetime measurement (Fig. 5) with the TAC and MCA replaced by a gate and delay gen-

erator (Ortec 416A) to create positive pulses and a multichannel scaler (MCS) (National

19

Instruments BNC 2090) to count the number of detected photons per second.

C. Analysis and results

The resolution of the wavemeter can be improved if one assumes that the noise is Gaussian.

Fig. 11 shows a plot of the number of photons vs wavemeter reading. The origin is arbitrarily

deﬁned to be 13732.476 cm−1 on the wavemeter. We ﬁt the data with two Gaussian peaks

plus a background. With this method we ﬁnd a hyperﬁne separation of 277.3

5.4 MHz.

±

We perform several scans recording both the number of counts and the relative (or per-

cent) position of the laser transmission peak with respect to two ﬁxed He-Ne transmission

peaks on the cavity. The result of a typical scan is shown in Fig. 12. The two peaks cor-

respond to the two hyperﬁne levels and they are separated by one free spectral range. We

ﬁt each peak with a Lorentzian function plus a background and then average over all the

scans. The diﬀerence in position between the two peaks is compared against the calibration

to obtain the separation in MHz. The statistical uncertainty is the main contribution on

the error budget (Table 3) with a 0.46% contribution.

The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld may modify the hyperﬁne splitting measurement through

a Zeeman splitting of the magnetic sublevels. Assuming all the atoms start from a common

state and reach the highest magnetic sublevel on each of the hyperﬁne levels we obtain an

upper limit for the contribution of the Zeeman shift of 0.16%.

The presence of laser beams on the excitation can induce an AC shift and splitting of

the hyperﬁne levels. We do not observe any clear asymmetry or splitting on each of the

hyperﬁne peaks, although we do see some power broadening. The natural linewidth from

the lifetime is 11.4 MHz, whereas the data has a linewidth of 24 MHz which shows power

broadening. We model the scan signal by solving the steady state optical Bloch equations24

and obtain an spectrum consistent with the data (Fig. 13). The intensities and detunings of

20

the beams were adjusted to approximate the data and are consistent with the experimental

ones. Using this model, we set limits for the eﬀect of the AC Stark shift on the hyperﬁne

splitting we measure to less than 0.2%.

theoretical prediction.26 The theoretical prediction assumes a nuclear magnetic moment

of 1.3534 in units of µN the nuclear magneton. We ﬁnd good agreement between both

experimental results and theory. Measurements of the hyperﬁne splitting of an s level are

useful to understand the contributions from radiative corrections such as the one produced

by the Breit interaction.27

4. Conclusions

We have measured the lifetime and hyperﬁne splitting of the second excited S1/2 level of Rb

and the lifetime of the second excited p manifold of Rb. We have used two-photon excita-

tion and time-correlated single-photon counting techniques on a sample of cold 85Rb atoms

conﬁned in a MOT. Our 7s lifetime measurement has excellent statistics and the result is

limited by systematic uncertainties. The measurement represents a ten-fold improvement

in the accuracy from previous measurements. The lifetime tests calculations of radial ma-

21

trix elements connecting excited states in Rb. Comparisons with ab-initio calculations of

the matrix elements for the diﬀerent decay channels agree to better than 0.3%. The mea-

surement of the lifetime of the 6p manifold does not diﬀerenciate between the two decay

channels from the ﬁne structure and achieves less accuracy, while a comparison to theory is

model dependent, but sets bounds for the two contributions. The 0.57% hyperﬁne splitting

measurement is in agreement with previous values and theoretical calculations.

All these measurements conﬁrm the high quality predictions of MBPT calculations and

increase the conﬁdence in the methods applied to heavier alkali atoms such as Fr and Cs

for similar spectroscopic studies and extraction of weak interaction information from PNC

measurements.

peaks in the cavity. The dots are the number of photons per second and the solid line is a ﬁt

with a Lorentz function plus a background. The two peaks correspond to the two hyperﬁne

levels and are separated by one free spectral range. gomezF12.EPS.

Fig. 13. Solution of the steady state optical Bloch equations and its comparison with the

data. The intensities and detunings of the beams were adjusted to approximate the data

and are consistent with the experimental values. We also add a background and an overall

scale to the simulation. The probe intensity used is 27 mW/cm2, the repumper intensity is

37 mW/cm2 and the repumper detuning is 3 MHz. gomezF13.EPS.

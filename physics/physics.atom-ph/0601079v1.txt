We report an experimental comparison of three-photon-absorption resonances (known as “N -
resonances”) for the D1 and D2 optical transitions of thermal 87Rb vapor. We ﬁnd that the D2
N -resonance has better contrast, a broader linewidth, and a more symmetric lineshape than the
D1 N -resonance. Taken together, these factors imply superior performance for frequency standards
operating on alkali D2 N -resonances, in contrast to coherent population trapping (CPT) resonances
for which the D2 transition provides poorer frequency standard performance than the D1 transition.

Recently, we

three-photon-
absorption resonances known as “N -resonances”[6, 7, 8]
are a promising alternative to coherent population
trapping (CPT) resonances[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for small
atomic frequency standards using thermal alkali vapor.
In this letter, we report an experimental comparison
of N -resonances for the 87Rb D1 (52S1/2 → 52P1/2,
λ = 795 nm) and D2 (52S1/2 → 52P3/2, λ = 780 nm)
optical transitions. We ﬁnd similar N -resonance quality
factors for the D1 and D2 transitions, but a signiﬁcantly
more symmetric lineshape for the D2 transition, which
together implies superior performance for a frequency
standard using the D2 N -resonance. Previous work has
shown that the quality factor of alkali CPT resonances
is about an order of magnitude worse for D2 operation
than for D1.[9, 10] Thus, as current miniature frequency
standards rely on vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers
(VCSELs) that are readily available for the D2 tran-
sitions of Rb and Cs but more diﬃcult to acquire for
the D1 transitions, the results reported here provide an
additional practical advantage for the N -resonance.

An N -resonance is a three-photon, two-optical-ﬁeld ab-
sorptive resonance (Fig. 1a). A probe ﬁeld, ΩP , reso-
nant with the transition between the higher-energy hy-
perﬁne level of the ground electronic state and an elec-
tronically excited state, optically pumps the atoms into
the lower hyperﬁne level, leading to increased transmis-
sion of the probe ﬁeld through the medium. A drive
ﬁeld, ΩD is detuned from the probe ﬁeld by the atomic
hyperﬁne frequency, ν0. Together, ΩP and ΩD create
a two-photon Raman resonance that drives atoms coher-
ently from the lower to the upper hyperﬁne level, thereby
inducing increased absorption of the probe ﬁeld ΩP in
a narrow resonance with linewidth, ∆ν, set by ground-
state hyperﬁne decoherence. Attractive features of N -
resonances for atomic frequency standards include high
resonance contrast, leading-order light-shift cancellation,
and less sensitivity than CPT resonances to high buﬀer
gas pressures.[7, 8]

Better performance for N -resonances than CPT reso-
nances on the D2 transition is expected due to the dif-

ference between the resonance mechanisms. The CPT
transmission maximum appears as a result of optical
pumping of atoms into a non-interacting coherent su-
perposition of two ground-state hyperﬁne levels (a “dark
state”). However, a pure dark state exists only for the D1
transition, thus the amplitude and contrast of CPT reso-
nances are much higher for D1 operation than for D2.[9]
For N -resonances, the three-photon absorptive process
does not require a dark state, with no resultant advantage
of D1 over D2. Furthermore, for circularly polarized light
(commonly used in optically-pumped atomic clocks) reso-
nant with the D1 transition, some atoms become trapped
in the Zeeman state with maximum angular momentum
— an “end” state ( F = 2, mF = ±2 for 87Rb) — which
limits resonance amplitude and contrast on the ground-
state ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne clock transition. However, for

D2 operation, the end state is coupled to the excited
state through the cycling transition F = 2 → F ′ = 3. In
the presence of strong collisional mixing in the excited
state (induced by alkali-buﬀer gas collisions), the cycling
transition suppresses optical pumping of atoms into the
end state. Thus we expect higher resonance contrast for
N -resonances operating on the D2 transition.

Figure 1b shows a schematic of our N -resonance appa-
ratus. We operated the system under conditions identi-
ﬁed in our previous work to give good frequency standard
performance.[7, 8] We derived the two optical ﬁelds ΩP
and ΩD by phase modulating the output of an external
cavity diode laser tuned to either the D1 or D2 transition
of 87Rb. Laser phase-modulation was performed at the
87Rb ground-state hyperﬁne frequency (ν0 ≃ 6.8 GHz)
by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) driven by an am-
pliﬁed microwave synthesizer phase-locked to a hydrogen
maser. We used the +1 sideband as the probe ﬁeld and
the zeroth order carrier as the drive ﬁeld. We set the laser
detuning ∆c and EOM modulation index to match the
conditions for leading-order light-shift cancellation: [8]
for D1, ∆c ≈ +700 MHz from the F = 2 → F ′ = 2 tran-
sition; for D2, ∆c ≈ +500 MHz from the F = 2 → F ′ = 3
transition; in both cases the modulation index ≈ 0.38,
corresponding to a probe/drive intensity ratio of about
19%. The laser beam was circularly polarized by a quar-
ter wave plate (λ/4) and weakly focused to a diameter of
0.8 mm before entering a Pyrex cell of length 7 cm and
diameter 2.5 cm containing isotopically enriched 87Rb
and 100 Torr of Ne buﬀer gas (which induced excited-
state collisional broadening ≈ 2 GHz). We heated the
cell to ≈ 65 ◦C, yielding 87Rb density ≈ 4 · 1011cm−3.
We isolated the Rb vapor cell from external magnetic
ﬁelds using three layers of high-permeability shielding,
and applied a small (≈ 10 mG) longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld to lift the degeneracy of the Zeeman sublevels and
separate the F = 1, mF = 0 to F = 2, mF = 0 clock
transition (with ﬁrst order magnetic ﬁeld independence)
from the mF = ±1 transitions with ﬁrst order magnetic
ﬁeld sensitivity. The transmitted probe ﬁeld power was
detected by a photodetector (PD); the strong drive ﬁeld
and the oﬀ-resonant lower sideband were ﬁltered from the
transmitted laser beam by a quartz narrow-band Fabry-
Perot etalon (FSR = 20 GHz, ﬁnesse = 30) tuned to the
frequency of the probe ﬁeld.

Figure 2 shows examples of measured D1 and D2 N -
resonances under identical conditions, with the probe
ﬁeld transmission normalized to unity away from two-
photon resonance. Figure 3 shows the measured de-
pendence on laser intensity of the N -resonance contrast,
linewidth, and quality factor. We deﬁne resonance con-
trast as C = 1 − Tmin/To, where Tmin and To are
the transmitted probe ﬁeld intensities on two-photon
resonance and away from resonance, respectively. The
linewidth, ∆ν, is the measured full-width-half-maximum
(FWHM); and the resonance quality factor is q = C/∆ν.
[The shot-noise limit to atomic clock frequency stability
is inversely proportional to the quality factor; i.e., larger

FIG. 2: Example 87Rb N -resonances observed for D1 and D2
optical transitions. Laser power is 260 µW, corresponding to
an intensity of 50 mW/cm2. Probe transmission is normalized
to unity away from two-photon resonance.

q corresponds to better frequency stability. [1]] As seen in
Figures 2 and 3, the typical measured N -resonance con-
trast is signiﬁcantly larger for D2 operation than for the
D1 transition, whereas the linewidth is broader for D2
than for D1. The diﬀerences in contrast and linewidth
largely oﬀset each other, such that the N -resonance qual-
ity factor is roughly comparable for the D1 and D2 transi-
tions over a wide range of operating conditions. Note that
in alkali vapor CPT resonances, the quality factor for the
D2 transition has been measured to be about an order of
magnitude smaller than for the D1 transition.[9, 10]

Optically-probed atomic frequency standards com-
monly employ slow modulation of the microwave drive
and associated phase-sensitive detection as part of the
crystal oscillator lock-loop. Hence an asymmetric atomic
resonance lineshape can induce systematic frequency
shifts proportional to the modulation parameters.[11] As
seen in Fig. 2, 87Rb N -resonances are signiﬁcantly more
symmetric for the D2 transition than for D1, which gives
an important advantage for D2 N -resonance operation.
The relative asymmetry of the D1 and D2 N -resonance
lineshapes can be quantiﬁed by describing each measured
N -resonance as a combination of symmetric and antisym-
metric Lorentzian functions:

T = To − A ∆ν/2 + B δ
∆ν2/4 + δ2

(1)

where T is the measured probe ﬁeld transmission as a
function of two-photon Raman detuning, δ; and A, B,
and ∆ν are ﬁt parameters that represent the amplitudes
of the symmetric and antisymmetric Lorentzian compo-
nents and the resonance linewidth. Fig. 4 shows the ratio
of antisymmetric and symmetric components, B/A, de-
termined from our N -resonance lineshape measurements,
as a function of laser intensity, indicating that the D1 N -
resonance is typically more than an order of magnitude
more asymmetric than the D2 N -resonance.
conclusion, N -resonances

three-photon-
absorption resonances that are a promising alternative
to CPT resonances for small atomic frequency standards
using alkali atoms. Here, we report an experimental

result implies a similar shot-noise-limit to N -resonance
frequency standard performance on the D1 and D2
transitions — in stark contrast with CPT resonances for
which the quality factor is about an order of magnitude
worse for the D2 transition than for D1. In addition, we
ﬁnd that the D2 N -resonance lineshape is signiﬁcantly
more symmetric than the D1 lineshape, indicating that
a D2 N -resonance frequency standard will have reduced
sensitivity to certain modulation-induced systematic
frequency shifts. Thus, unlike for CPT resonances,
commercially available diode lasers for the D2 lines of
Rb and Cs can likely be used without compromising the
performance of an N -resonance frequency standard.

We have measured the frequency splitting between the (2S, F = 1/2) and (2S, F = 3/2) hyperﬁne
sublevels in atomic deuterium by an optical diﬀerential method based on two-photon Doppler-free
spectroscopy on a cold atomic beam. The result f (D)
HFS(2S) = 40 924 454(7) Hz is the most precise
value for this interval to date.
In comparison to the previous radio-frequency measurement we
have improved the accuracy by the factor of three. The speciﬁc combination of hyperﬁne frequency
intervals for metastable- and ground states in deuterium atom D21 = 8f (D)
HFS(1S) derived
from our measurement is in a good agreement with D21 calculated from quantum-electrodynamics
theory.

INTRODUCTION

the experimental accuracy which is mainly restricted by
the uncertainty in the determination of the fHFS(2S).

High-precision measurements in light atomic systems
permit accurate tests of the quantum-electrodynamics
theory (QED). QED calculations enter into a number of
fundamental values related to free particles and simple
atoms. In conventional atomic systems the accuracy of
QED tests is restricted by insuﬃcient knowledge of the
nuclear structure which is the main obstacle on the way
to improve theoretical predictions for the Lamb shift and
the hyperﬁne structure in hydrogen (see e.g. [1, 2]).

The leading corrections for diﬀerent energy levels com-
ing from nuclear size eﬀects are proportional to the
squared value of non-relativistic wave function of the elec-
tron at the origin:

∆Enucl = AN · |ψ(r = 0)|2 ,

(1)

where the value of the coeﬃcient AN is determined
by parameters of the nucleus and does not depend on
atomic quantum numbers. For s–levels in hydrogen-
like systems the non-relativistic wave function at the
origin scales with the principal quantum number n as
|ψ(r = 0)|2 ∼ 1/n3. Thus, if one takes the following
diﬀerence of the energies E(nS) corresponding to two
diﬀerent s–levels n′3E(n′S) − n3E(nS), the leading con-
tribution of nuclear eﬀects cancels.

Recently, a signiﬁcant progress in calculations of the
8EHFS(2S)− EHFS(1S) diﬀerence of 2S and 1S hyperﬁne
splitting (HFS) intervals in light hydrogen-like atoms has
been achieved [3]. New state-dependent QED terms to
the HFS interval frequency fHFS(nS) up to the fractional
order of α4 and α3 me/mp have been calculated as well
as the next-to-leading nuclear structure eﬀects. The ac-
curacy of this theoretical prediction for D21 exceeds now

Experimental results are available for the 1S and 2S
hyperﬁne interval in hydrogen [4, 5, 6, 7], deuterium
[8, 9] and the helium-3 ion [10, 11]. The study of neu-
tral atoms and ions requires diﬀerent experimental tech-
niques. While 1S HFS intervals in neutral atoms [4, 8]
have been measured with a higher relative accuracy as in
the helium-3 ion [10], the 2S HFS intervals in hydrogen
[6, 7] and deuterium [9] are known less precisely as in the
helium-3 ion [11]. Since the traditional microwave meth-
ods have likely reached their limits we have been working
on an optical determination of the hyperﬁne interval in
the metastable 2S state of hydrogen and deuterium.

Recently we have measured the hyperﬁne splitting of
the 2S state of the hydrogen atom applying an optical
technique [7]. It is based on two-photon spectroscopy on
a cold beam shielded from magnetic ﬁelds. The 2S HFS
interval has been determined from the frequency diﬀer-
ence of two stable light ﬁelds exciting 1S–2S transitions
for singlet (F = 0) and triplet (F = 1) components. The
diﬀerential method cancels a number of systematic ef-
fects intrinsic to two-photon spectroscopy which provides
a signiﬁcant increase of accuracy in comparison with ab-
solute frequency measurements [12, 13, 14].

We have improved this technique [7] and applied it
to the spectroscopy of atomic deuterium. The hyperﬁne
structure in deuterium is approximately 4 times smaller
than in hydrogen and its accurate optical measurement is
a harder problem, however, a smaller HFS value has also
some advantages due to a reduction of certain system-
atic eﬀects for the comparison of the 1S–2S frequencies
between diﬀerent spin states. The experiment and its
systematic eﬀects are presented in two following sections
while a comparison of theory and experiment is summa-
rized in the concluding part of the paper.

II. MEASUREMENT OF THE 2S HYPERFINE
SPLITTING

The 2S HFS interval has been measured once by Reich,

Heberle, and Kusch [9]. The value of

f (D)
HFS(2S) = 40 924 439(20) Hz

(2)

has been obtained by a radio-frequency (rf) method ap-
plied earlier to a similar measurement in hydrogen [5]. In
comparison to the hydrogen measurement [5], the abso-
lute accuracy of determination of f (D)
HFS(2S) [9] has been
improved by a factor of 3.
In spite of the fact that
the HFS intervals in deuterium are strongly aﬀected by
magnetic ﬁelds, as in hydrogen, the average of two rf
transitions frequencies in the metastable deuterium atom
(F = 1/2, mF = −1/2) ↔ (F = 3/2, mF = 1/2) and
(F = 1/2, mF = 1/2) ↔ (F = 3/2, mF = −1/2) con-
tains no linear ﬁeld-dependent terms and thus is rather
insensitive to the ﬁeld. Still, the most important sys-
tematic eﬀects contributing to the 20 Hz error were the
uncertainty in the determination of the magnetic ﬁeld
and the rf Stark eﬀect.

For an independent measurement of f (D)

HFS(2S) we use
the hydrogen spectrometer setup described elsewhere
[15]. A dye laser operating near 486 nm is locked to
a deﬁnite TEM00 mode of an ultra-stable cavity with
Ultra-Low Expansion (ULE) glass spacer and a drift less
than 0.5 Hz/s (Fig.1). To change the laser frequency with
respect to the cavity mode we use a broadband double-
pass acousto-optic modulator (AOM) placed between the
laser and the cavity. The frequency of the dye laser is
doubled in a Barium β-borate crystal, and the result-
ing 243 nm radiation is coupled to a linear enhancement
cavity inside the vacuum chamber where the two-photon
excitation takes place.

Atomic deuterium produced in a 15 W, 2.5 GHz rf
gas discharge ﬂows through teﬂon tubes to a copper noz-
zle cooled by a ﬂow-through cryostat (Fig.2). Atoms
thermalize with the nozzle walls and leave the nozzle in
both directions coaxially with the enhancement cavity
mode. A part of the atoms ﬂying along the mode are ex-
cited to the 2S state and then reach the detection zone
where a weak electrical quenching ﬁeld is applied. The

ﬁeld mixes the 2S and 2P states of the atoms causing
their fast decay to the ground state with the emission of
Lyman–α photons. Photons are counted by a solar-blind
photomultiplier connected to a photon counter incorpo-
rated into time-of-ﬂight measurement scheme. The exci-
tation radiation is periodically blocked before the cav-
ity by a chopper wheel, and 121 nm photons are de-
tected only within a 3 ms dark time interval. Introduc-
ing a delay τ between closing the beam and starting the
detection, we can thus select diﬀerent velocity groups
contributing to the signal. The delay τ sets an upper
limit for the atomic velocity to vmax = l/τ , where l is
the distance between the nozzle and detector. Using a
multi-channel scaler we sort the counts in adjacent time
bins (τ = 10 µs, 210 µs, 410 µs, . . .,) and simultaneously
record up to 12 spectra containing the information about
velocity-dependent eﬀects, e.g. 2nd order Doppler eﬀect.
Here we will point out some important changes which
have been introduced in the spectrometer conﬁguration
(which has been used for the recent measurements in
atomic hydrogen [7, 14]) to optimize it for the current
deuterium measurement. To maximize the count rate for
slow atoms (v ∼ 200 m/s) one has to ﬁnd a compromise
between thermalization and recombination processes at
the cold walls of the nozzle by adjusting the nozzle geom-
etry and temperature. The best rates are observed with
a larger nozzle diameter (2–2.5 mm compared to 1.2 mm
for hydrogen) and at slightly higher temperatures (6–6.5
K compared to 5 K). Typically, the count rate with the
deuterium beam has been higher than for hydrogen (by
a factor 2–5 depending on τ ).

On the way between the gas discharge and the nozzle
we have installed a bypass valve which can be opened to
a high-vacuum (HV) part of the vacuum chamber, where
the cavity mirrors, the nozzle and the detector have been
placed. By opening the valve we reduce the atomic ﬂow
through the nozzle by a factor of 4. Even at the lowest
pressure in the gas discharge (0.7 mbar) and with opened
valve, the count rate was suﬃcient to detect a solid 2S
signal for the atoms with v ∼ 200 m/s. The high-vacuum

volume is pumped by a turbo-molecular pump to 5 · 10−5
mbar.

Atoms are collimated by two 1.5 mm diaphragms sepa-
rating the HV and the ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) volumes.
Most of the interaction region (95%) is in the UHV re-
gion pumped by a 104 l/s cryopump. Without the atomic
beam, the background gas pressure in the UHV region
equals 3 · 10−8 mbar. The background gas pressure in-
creases with the deuterium ﬂow escaping from the nozzle
and can be thus varied up to 2 · 10−7 mbar.

The excitation region is shielded against external mag-
netic ﬁelds. As in [7], we use a two-stage µ–metal shield-
ing. The outer shielding together with the compensation
ﬁeld reduces residual ﬁelds over the entire interaction re-
gion to 10–20 mG. Conﬁguration of the inner shielding
has been improved to increase the shielding factor as well
as its throughput for pumping.

In the absence of magnetic ﬁelds, the 2S HFS interval
frequency is given by the following combination of optical
frequencies and the ground state HFS interval:

HFS(2S) = f (D)
f (D)

HFS(1S) + fF =3/2 − fF =1/2,

(3)

where fF =1/2 and fF =3/2 are the frequencies of the dou-
blet and the quadruplet transitions at 121 nm (see Fig.3).
In our experiment, we measure the frequency diﬀerence
(fF =3/2 − fF =1/2) using two-photon spectroscopy of the
corresponding transitions. The frequency of the ground-
state splitting has been measured by Wineland and Ram-
sey [8] with an uncertainty of 5 · 10−12:

f (D)
HFS(1S) = 327 384 352.5222(17) Hz.

(4)

The contribution to the resulting error budget introduced
by this uncertainty is negligible.

FIG. 4: Simultaneous recording of the two transition lines
(top). AOM frequencies fAOM corresponding to the centers
of the doublet and quadruplet transition lines (bootom). The
frequency change is due to the drift of the reference ULE
cavity (bottom).

For allowed two-photon transitions between the levels
with ∆F = 0, the contribution of the linear Zeeman ef-
fect cancels and the HFS frequency shift in a magnetic
ﬁeld B scales as B2/fHFS which is unfavorable for deu-
terium in comparison to hydrogen. But due to a low-ﬁeld
regime and the absence of linear terms, our measurement
is rather insensitive to magnetic ﬁelds. In our case, the
magnetic ﬁeld B shifts the frequency f (D)
HFS(2S) approxi-
mately as 35 · B2 kHz/G2.

The laser as well as the lock electronic are adjusted in
such a way, that the two (1S, F = 1/2) → (2S, F = 1/2)
(doublet) (1S, F = 3/2) → (2S, F = 3/2) (quadruplet)
transitions can be excited by changing the AOM fre-
quency (see Fig.3).

To measure the frequency diﬀerence between the two
two-photon transitions we have applied the following pro-
cedure. The frequency of the double-pass AOM placed
between the reference ULE cavity and the laser is tuned
to one of the transitions and one point of the spectrum is
measured with a photon accumulation time of 0.5 s. After
the measurement, the AOM frequency fAOM is sweeped
over a big ﬁxed frequency interval (approximately equals
to [f (D)
HFS(2S)]/8 ≈ 36 MHz) to reach the
other two-photon transition. During the sweep, the laser
has been continuously kept in lock. The factor 8 arises
from the double-pass scheme for the AOM, the second
harmonic generation stage and the two-photon process.
Than we introduce 0.5 s pause as recovery time for mul-

HFS(1S) − f (D)

tiple feedbacks, and repeat the measurement of one point
of the other two-photon transition. After the measure-
ment we add a small frequency step for scan and sweep
the synthesizer back to the ﬁrst transition. The result of
such a procedure is presented on Fig.4(top).

The rf synthesizer driving the AOM is continuously
referenced to the 10 MHz signal of a HP5071A cesium
frequency standard calibrated by GPS (Fig.1). The mis-
calibration of the primary standard introduces a negli-
gible uncertainty to the measured diﬀerence. After the
double-pass AOM, the laser light is spatially ﬁltered by
means of a single-mode ﬁber, while the intensity of the
light coupled into the cavity is actively stabilized. That
guarantees that the coupling conditions which can change
the frequency of the reference cavity mode [16] are the
same for both transitions.

Both simultaneously recorded doublet and quadruplet
transition lines are ﬁtted with a Lorentzian function in
the time and frequency domains. A typical time inter-
val between the centers of such a line pair is less than
5 s. This corresponds to some small correction on a
level of a few hertz which should be introduced to cor-
rect for the reference cavity drift (ﬁg.4(bottom)). Such
a procedure signiﬁcantly reduces the inﬂuence of refer-
ence cavity frequency ﬂuctuations on the 2S HFS data
statistics. The new method suppresses the inﬂuence com-
ing from all drifts in the experimental setup with a time
scale exceeding 200 s which is required to record one
line. Even though such ﬂuctuations do not introduce sys-
tematic shifts, a long time is required to average them.
The approach is much more forgiving to systematic ef-
fects: one independent point is obtained after 3 minutes
of measurement, while for the previous method [7] the
corresponding time interval was about 20 minutes.

III. RESULTS AND SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS

We have measured f (D)

HFS(2S) during 7 days using the
new method and during 6 days applying the method de-
scribed in [7]. To test for systematic eﬀects we have
varied diﬀerent parameters of the experiment within
each day. We have recorded over 1000 deuterium time-
resolved spectra. The averaged amplitude ratio between
quadruplet and doublet transitions equals to 2.00(2)
which is in a good agreement with theoretical expecta-
tion.

The systematic eﬀects for our two-photon beam spec-
troscopy are well-known [13]. For the diﬀerential mea-
surement, the most signiﬁcant eﬀects cancel out. As
shown in [7], the diﬀerential dynamic Stark shift can-
cels to the level of 10−6 relative to the shift of the 1S–2S
transition (about 500 Hz). Because of some residual ﬂuc-
tuations of the 243 nm radiation intensity, the doublet
and quadruplet lines acquire slightly diﬀerent shifts. We
correct for this diﬀerence for each line by monitoring the
power leaking out of the cavity (Fig.2). The resulting
correction for the new method equals 0.5 Hz which is a

4

factor 4 lower than for the measurement in hydrogen [7].
For the simultaneous recording technique, long-term in-
tensity ﬂuctuations in the enhancement cavity contribute
less to the result than in the case of [7]. Besides the cor-
rection, we add a 0.5 Hz uncertainty to the error budget.
A DC electrical ﬁeld E mixes 2S and 2P levels caus-
ing a 2S level shift. According to [17], the energy shift of
the 2S level is reversely proportional to the Lamb shift.
Thus, the diﬀerential shift scales as EHFS/L2S−2P , where
L2S−2P is the Lamb shift of the 2S level. The evaluated
shift of the 2S HFS interval in deuterium equals −300
E2 Hz cm2/V2 and is about 4 times smaller as in hydro-
gen. The excitation region is shielded from stray ﬁelds
by coating all surrounding parts of the interaction region
with graphite. Residual stray ﬁelds in the setup are esti-
mated to be less than 30 mV/cm [18], which corresponds
to a 2S HFS frequency shift on a level of −0.3 Hz. We
add an uncertainty of 0.5 Hz to the error budget con-
sidering the slightly worse geometrical properties of our
shielding compared to the Faraday cage used in [18].

Residual magnetic ﬁelds split the magnetic sublevels
and shift the measured hyperﬁne splitting to higher
values. The shift mostly originates from imperfectly
shielded parts of the excitation region lying in the HV re-
gion (Fig.2). To check for this eﬀect we have once made a
set of measurements without compensation ﬁeld and ob-
served a change of f (D)
HFS(2S) equal to 20(22) Hz. Without
compensation ﬁeld, the measured value of magnetic ﬁelds
around the nozzle and the detector is about 200 mG. The
compensation ﬁeld reduces the magnetic ﬁelds for at least
a factor of 10, which means that the residual shift should
be on a sub-hertz level. We conservatively estimate the
shift as 0.5(1.0) Hz.

Another source for level shifts is a pressure shift caused
by collisions with the background gas and within the
beam itself. The ground-state hyperﬁne splitting in hy-
drogen and deuterium is rather insensitive to collisions.
Typically, this shift is on a level of 1 Hz/mbar depending
on the buﬀer gas [19, 20] which corresponds to a vanish-
ing shift for our pressure range. On the other side, there
are no reliable experimental data for the pressure shift of
the 2S HFS frequency [6, 7]. The upper limit for the 2S
HFS frequency shift can be taken as the frequency shift
of the 1S (F = 1, mF = ±1) ↔ 2S (F ′ = 1, m′
F = ±1)
transition equal to −8(2) MHz/mbar [21, 22]. But con-
sidering the theoretical works [23, 24], there is no reason
to expect the 2S HFS shift to be orders of magnitude
higher than for the ground state.

We have experimentally investigated the inﬂuence of
collisions on the f (D)
HFS(2S) frequency. Most of the colli-
sions take place within the atomic beam where the pres-
sure can be much higher than the background gas pres-
sure. Using the method of simultaneous detection, we
have varied the atomic ﬂow over a wide range by chang-
ing the pressure in the gas discharge (between 0.8 mbar
and 8 mbar) and by opening the bypass valve (Fig.2).
The background gas pressure scales linearly with the ﬂow
with a small oﬀset of 3 · 10−8 mbar. Experimental data

are presented in Fig.5. Each point represents the result
of statistical averaging of multiple data points detected
at diﬀerent days. About 1/4 of all the data have been
taken at the lowest pressure in the gas discharge with
an opened valve (the left point). At high ﬂows the slow
atoms are accelerated and pushed away from the beam
by collisions (Zacharias eﬀect) [18] which causes a loss
in statistics and corresponding increase of uncertainty.
Moreover, the measurement time becomes restricted by
a fast growth of a ﬁlm of molecular deuterium on the
nozzle. For the previous method [7] the ﬂow range of {2 -
8} (Fig.5) is practically unreachable. Disregarding the
delay time τ we have not observed any indication for a
2S HFS interval pressure shift on our level of accuracy.
The observed transition lines are shifted by the sec-
ond order Doppler eﬀect in a range between 0.1–1 kHz
depending on the velocity distribution of the atoms con-
tributing to the signal [13]. The lines are not symmet-
ric and signiﬁcantly diﬀer from Lorentzian proﬁles at
short (τ < 410µs) delays (Fig.6).

τ equal for both singlet and quadruplet transitions, the
shift and the inﬂuence of the asymmetry should cancel
out. To estimate the possible uncertainty coming form
the ”wrong” ﬁtting procedure with a Lorentzian function
and all other velocity-dependent eﬀects, we have evalu-
ated the f (D)
HFS(2S) frequency for diﬀerent delays. The
data for each delay has been corrected for the AC Stark
shift, and then the extrapolation to zero ﬂow has been
made (Fig.5). The results of this extrapolation are pre-
sented in the Table I. All velocity-dependent systematic
eﬀects, if they exist, should reveal themselves in such
evaluation procedure.

All the results are consistent within the error bars. For
higher delays τ the corresponding uncertainty grows due
to the lack of statistics. As a ﬁnal value we have chosen
the result f (D)
HFS(2S) = 40 924 453(5) Hz (τ = 410 µs) due
to the following reasons: (i) the statistical uncertainty
for this result is small, (ii) the line-proﬁle is practically
undistinguishable from Lorentzian, and (iii) the fast non-
thermalized atoms do not contribute to the signal. We
add an additional uncertainty of 0.3 Hz corresponding to
the conservatively estimated shift coming from the colli-
sions with the residual background gas.

The data obtained during 6 days of measurement ap-
plying the older method presented in [7] give the result of
f (D)
HFS(2S) = 40 924 462(15) Hz. The data are measured
only at low deuterium ﬂows {0.2–1.5} and are simply av-
eraged over the entire ensemble. We have increased the
uncertainty due to the possible pressure shift (1 Hz) and
the AC Stark shift (2 Hz).

Combining both these statistically independent results
and adding all known systematic uncertainties linearly,
we arrive at the ﬁnal value for the 2S hyperﬁne interval
in atomic deuterium

f (D)
HFS(2S) = 40 924 454(7) Hz.

This result is in a good agreement with the one obtained
by an rf method [9], but is more accurate by a factor 3.

Table II.

IV. D21 DIFFERENCE

To derive the D21 diﬀerence we should combine our
result with the known value of the 1S HFS interval [8]:

Dexp

21 = 8f (D)

HFS(2S) − f (D)

HFS(1S) = 11 280(56) Hz.

(6)

This result is in a good agreement with the theoretical
prediction [3]

Dtheor

21 = 11 312.5(5) Hz.

The experimental and theoretical values are presented
in Fig.7. Restricted by the experimental accuracy, we
can test the state-dependent QED contributions on the
level of 0.2 ppm which can be compared to similar tests
in hydrogen [7] and the 3He+ ion [11]. We point out
that the absolute accuracy of our measurement exceeds
the both cited results, while the relative accuracy suﬀers
from the relatively small HFS interval in deuterium.

Today precision optical methods challenge even in
ﬁelds were classical rf methods have been traditionally
considered as favorable. After a successful measurement
of the Lamb shift [13, 25] and the 2S the HFS interval
[7] in the hydrogen atom we have now presented a result
on the 2S HFS interval in deuterium with an accuracy
exceeding that of rf methods.

The accuracy of the optical measurement can be im-
proved by the further reducing the atomic velocity. The
current results indicate that the pressure shift, which lim-
its the accuracy of absolute frequency measurements in
ultra-cold hydrogen [22], may not play such a crucial role
for the diﬀerential technique.

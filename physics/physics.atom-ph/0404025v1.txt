(Dated: February 2, 2008)

A recently developed Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic evolution of
Hartree-Fock states has been applied to compute the static correlation functions of a one-dimensional
model of attractively interacting two component fermions. The numerical results have been exten-
sively compared to existing approximate approaches. The crossover to a condensate of pairs can be
identiﬁed as the ﬁrst-order pair coherence extending throughout the whole size of the system. The
possibility of revealing the onset of the transition with other observables such as the density-density
correlations or the second-order momentum space correlations is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The recent developments in the cooling and trapping techniques of neutral atoms have opened the way to the realization
of fermionic atomic samples at temperatures well below the degeneracy temperature [1]. This suggests that atomic
gases are ideal candidates for the study of the physics of degenerate many-fermion systems. With respect to solid
state ones, atomic systems oﬀer in fact a better isolation from external disturbances such as material defects, a better
knowledge of the microscopic details of the systems, as well as a wider range of tunability of the parameters, in
particular the interparticle interactions. By tuning the external magnetic ﬁeld around a Feshbach resonance, the
atom-atom scattering length a can be varied from kF a =
(kF being the Fermi momentum) opening the
way towards a comprehensive study of the pairing transition both in the regime a > 0 in which a Bose-condensate
(BEC) of tightly-bound molecules is present, and in the regime a < 0 (BCS) in which a condensate of Cooper pairs
is formed. Diatomic molecules have been created and observed by several experimental groups [2]. Bose-Einstein
condensation of tightly bound diatomic molecules has been recently reported [3]. The crossover region between BEC
and BCS is currently under experimental investigation [4] and ﬁrst evidences of pairing in the crossover region have
been reported in [5].

From the theoretical point of view, a large eﬀort is currently made to establish the main features of the pairing for
1, regime in which the atomic gas shows strong correlations [6, 7, 8]. In
a
high values of the scattering length kF |
particular, the dependance of the transition temperature on the interaction strength in this crossover region is still
an open problem.

| ≫

The present paper reports a numerical study of the condensation of pairs in a regime of relatively strong interactions,
so to characterize the consequences of the transition on the diﬀerent observables of the system and identify speciﬁc
features which may represent unambiguous signatures of the onset of condensation of pairs.

The calculations have been performed by applying the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method developed in [9] to
a one-dimensional lattice model of fermions with attractive on-site interactions. A short description of the model
under examination is given in sec. II, while the numerical algorithm used for the calculations is presented in sec. III.
Numerical results are presented in sec. IV and then extensively compared to the predictions of a perturbative expansion
in the interaction coupling constant (sec. V), and of existing approximate approaches (sec.VI), such as the BCS
theory [10, 11], two versions of the random phase approximation (RPA) [12, 13] as well as the Nozi`eres Schmitt-Rink
theory [6].

Several among the most relevant correlation functions of the Fermi gas have been considered here,

the two σ =

are modeled by a two-body discrete delta potential with a coupling constant g0. The ﬁeld operators ˆΨσ(x) satisfy

according to ˆΨσ(x) =

the discrete model to correctly reproduce the underlying continuous ﬁeld theory, the grid spacing dx must be smaller
than all the relevant length scales of the system, e.g. the thermal wavelength and the mean interparticle spacing.
In the present one-dimensional case, the relation between the coupling constant on the lattice and the physical 1D

III. THE QUANTUM MONTE CARLO SCHEME

We assume the gas to be at thermal equilibrium at a temperature T in the canonical ensemble, so that the unnormalized
density operator ρeq(β) = e−βH with β = 1/kBT . From textbook statistical physics, we know that such a density
operator can be obtained by means of an imaginary-time evolution:

during a “time” interval τ = 0
where ρeq(τ = 0) = 1N , 1 being the identity matrix in the N -body Hilbert space.
As it has been recently shown in [9], the exact solution of the imaginary-time evolution (3) can be written as a
statistical average of Hartree-Fock dyadics of the form:

This writing of the identity operator can be used as a starting point for an exact simulation of the fermionic many-
body problem. To this purpose, we have to numerically solve the stochastic diﬀerential equations (7) for imaginary
times going from τ = 0 to τ = β. This is done by splitting the imaginary-time interval into a large enough number

IV. MONTE CARLO RESULTS FOR THE CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

A Monte Carlo code based on the stochastic approach described in the previous section has been used to numerically
compute the expectation values of some one- and two-body correlation functions for a one-dimensional Fermi gas with
attractive binary interactions as described by the Hamiltonian (1) with g0 < 0. The results of analogous calculations
performed with a very similar Monte Carlo algorithm have been reported recently in [18]. Other Quantum Monte Carlo
schemes have also been applied to the numerical study of the fermionic Hubbard model with attractive interactions
at ﬁnite temperature. In particular, the determinantal QMC algorithm [19] has been used to study the correlation
functions in 2D [20] and the transition temperature to a pair condensate state in 2D [21, 22] and in 3D [23].

For our simulations, a lattice of
M
of imaginary-time steps comprised between 400 and 1000 has been used. As already mentioned, the ensemble in
which observables are calculated is the canonical one; note that the number of particles in each of the spin state can
ﬂuctuate, only the total number of particles is ﬁxed. As the two spin components are equivalent, the mean densities
in each of the spin components are equal:

= 16 points was taken, with a total number of N = 12 atoms. A number

.

The state of the gas in the absence of interactions and at T = 0 is depicted in Fig. 1:
in a given spin component,
the 5 lowest-lying single particle energy levels are totally ﬁlled, whereas the two degenerate states of wavevectors
k+ = kF = 6π/L and k− =
< kF , and the

, which can be done in 6 diﬀerent
two remaining atoms are distributed among the 4 degenerate states,
ways. In presence of attractive interactions, this degeneracy will obviously be lifted and the conﬁgurations with one
atom
with opposite momenta in the degenerate multiplicity are favorable to the formation of a

Cooper pair.

ρσ

The simplest observable to compute is the one-body correlation function in a single spin state σ (normalized to the
density ρσ):

(cid:10)
The Monte Carlo prediction is plotted in ﬁg.2 for diﬀerent values of the temperature: as expected, this correlation
function is short-ranged, coherence extending only on a length of the order of the Fermi length ℓF = 1/kF for
T < TF . This correlation function is indeed the Fourier transform of the momentum distribution of the gas. As the
interactions aﬀect the momentum distribution only in a thin region around the Fermi surface (the Fermi points in our
one-dimensional geometry), they do not signiﬁcantly modify its shape as compared to the ideal Fermi distribution.

(cid:11)

Because of the rotational symmetry of the density operator in the spin space, the one-body correlation function in
diﬀerent spin states:

is instead always identically vanishing.

not only the increase of g(2)

subsection, at this temperature a condensate of pairs is present. The oscillations then result from the contribution
of two distinct eﬀects: the Friedel oscillations in the correlation functions of the normal phase which follow from the

sharpness of the Fermi surface [13], and the oscillations shown by the Cooper pair wavefunction described within the

which, as we shall see in the next subsection, is much higher than the critical temperature T ∗ for the appearance of
long-range order.

C. First-order pair coherence function

It is believed in statistical physics that the superﬂuid transition in two-component Fermi systems with attractive
binary interactions is related to the appearance of long-range order in the so-called anomalous averages [10].
In
symmetry breaking theories such as the BCS one, this feature corresponds to a non-vanishing value for the gap
function deﬁned as:

−
which plays the role of the order parameter of the phase transition in a Ginzburg-Landau approach.
In number
conserving approaches, quantities like (20) are zero. The phase transition however still appears in the long-range
behaviour of correlation functions of the form:

↑(x) ˆΨ↑(0) ˆΨ↓(0)
(cid:11)

.

A similar criterion was used in [21, 22, 23] to determine the transition temperature.

A simple physical interpretation of g(1)
pair can be provided as the ﬁrst order correlation function of pairs: the operator
ˆΨ↑(0) ˆΨ↓(0) annihilates in fact a pair of particles in opposite spin states at the spatial position 0 and the operator
ˆΨ†
↑(x) creates them back at x. This correlation function is therefore formally equivalent to the ﬁrst order
coherence function of a composite boson formed by a pair of fermions with opposite spins. From this point of view,
the non-vanishing long-range limit of g(1)

pair(x) is a signature of a quantum condensation of pairs.

Monte Carlo simulations for this quantity are shown in ﬁg.5. At low temperatures, g(1)
pair(x) has a ﬁnite value also
for x = L/2, i.e. at the largest distance from 0 allowed by the ﬁnite size of the box. On the other hand, at higher
temperatures, but still much lower than the Fermi temperature, g(1)
pair(L/2) becomes very small and the long-range
order is destroyed. To make this cross-over more apparent, we have plotted in Fig. 6 the value of g(1)
pair(L/2) as a
function of the temperature: a sudden rise of this quantity appears at low temperatures. This behavior qualitatively

corresponds to the one expected for a BCS transition: although a BCS transition can not occur in one dimension in the
thermodynamical limit because of long wavelength ﬂuctuations destroying the long range order [24], it can however be
observed in our simulations because of the ﬁnite size of the system. As the system is ﬁnite, the transition temperature
T ∗ is not precisely deﬁned and the long-range order has an analytic dependance on temperature. Notice that the
opposite spin density-density correlation described by g(2)
↑↓ (0) are already important at T > T ∗ and for T < T ∗ they
only get slightly reinforced.

D. Second-order momentum space correlation function

Another observable that has been recently proposed as a possible way of detecting the transition to a pair condensate
state is the second-order momentum space correlation function [25]:

where the operator ˆnkσ = ˆa†
As discussed in [25], BCS theory predicts that correlations should be absent above TBCS, that is G(2)
transition to a condensate state should be observable as the appearance of a non-vanishing value of G(2)
peaked around k = kF .
In ﬁg.7, we have plotted Monte Carlo results for G(2)
k as a function of k for diﬀerent values of the temperature. At all
temperatures, the quantity is indeed strongly peaked at k = kF , and nearly vanishes at the other values. A summary
of the temperature-dependence of G(2)
k (kF ) is plotted in ﬁg.8. At temperatures above the transition temperature T ∗,
correlations are negative and increase as the temperature is lowered. The negative correlation simply follows from the
fact that we are working in the canonical ensemble, that is at a ﬁxed total number of particles (see the ideal Fermi
gas result in ﬁg.8). As the temperature drops below T ∗, the correlations change sign becoming large and positive.
This is a signature of pairing: because of the attractive interactions, the states with a ﬁlled Fermi sphere plus two
particles in states of opposite momenta and spins are in fact energetically favoured. In this state, the ﬂuctuations of

V. RESULTS OF A PERTURBATIVE EXPANSION IN g0

pair and the density correlation function g(2)
In this section, we explain how to calculate the pair coherence function g(1)
↑↓
by means of a series expansion in powers of the coupling constant g0. The same procedure was used in ﬁg.7 to obtain
a series expansion for the momentum-space second order correlation function G(2)
although we do not give here the
k
details of the calculation. We expect this perturbative approach performed around the ideal Fermi gas to be eﬃcient
mainly at T > T ∗ that is in absence of a condensate of pairs. For T < T ∗ we indeed found numerically that the series
(up to order 3) is slowly convergent. Note that such a series expansion can however be shown to be convergent at
non-zero temperature for our model system with a ﬁnite number of modes, see below.

As we wish to compare to the Quantum Monte Carlo results, we have in principle to perform the perturbative
treatment directly in the canonical ensemble with N particles. The resulting averages in the ideal Fermi gas thermal
state are however diﬃcult to evaluate analytically. We therefore apply the following trick to ‘canonize’ the grand
canonical ensemble. We introduce an unnormalized grand canonical thermal density operator deﬁned as

where ˆN is the total number operator, θ is an angle and µ0 is the chemical potential of the ideal Fermi gas with an
average number of N particles. Taking the Fourier component of σ(θ) over the harmonic eiθN amounts to projecting
σ(θ) over the subspace with exactly N particles. The canonical expectation value of an operator O is therefore exactly
given by [31]:

H0 is the kinetic energy operator of the gas and the imaginary time interaction picture for an operator X is

X(τ ) = eτ (H0−µ0 ˆN )Xe−τ (H0−µ0 ˆN ).

For a non-zero temperature and a ﬁnite number of grid points, the norm of the operator V (τ ) is ﬁnite as both V and
µ0 ˆN have a ﬁnite norm. As a consequence, the norm of the nth-order contribution to the series expansion Eq. (25)
H0 −
can be bounded from above by An/n! where A is some number, and the series Eq. (25) is absolutely convergent [32].

The calculation of the numerator of Eq. (24) then involves the θ-dependent grand canonical partition function of the
ideal Fermi gas and θ-dependent expectation values in the grand canonical ideal Fermi gas:

#

(cid:17)

where the square originates from the presence of two spin components. The operator X is one of the terms inside the
square brackets of Eq.(25). The expectation values can be evaluated using Wick’s theorem and involve the following
particle and hole correlation functions:

The explicit expressions of the relevant expectation values in terms of G0 and ¯G0 are given in the Appendix B. The
integrals over the ‘times’ τ1, τ2, τ3 and the sums over the grid points associated to each factor V (τi) are performed
numerically. As each integral is discretized in 256 steps and there are 16 grid points in the lattice, the calculation of
the third order correction involves the summation of about 1010 terms for a given value of θ.
The perturbative results for the x = 0 pair distribution function g(2)
↑↓ (0) are plotted against the Monte Carlo results as
a function of temperature in Fig. 4 for various orders of the perturbative expansion. The agreement with the second
order expansion is perfect at high temperature, whereas the third order contribution is required to have agreement

at lower temperatures [33]. For a given temperature, the x dependence of g(2)
↑↓ (x) predicted by the perturbative
expansion is also in good agreement with the exact Monte Carlo results. For g(1)
pair(x), the agreement is also good, at
high temperature in Fig. 5a, as well as at a temperature T < T ∗ in Fig. 5. The fact that the third order prediction is
very close to the Quantum Monte Carlo results even when long range order is present may be fortuitous: it signiﬁcantly
diﬀers from the second order prediction so that a calculation of the fourth order correction is required to justify the
truncation of the series at this order.

B.

In the grand canonical ensemble

It is actually interesting to perform also the perturbative expansion in the grand canonical ensemble: simpler analytical
formulas can be obtained, which can be used to test existing approximate theories applicable to the grand canonical
ensemble. The unnormalized density operator of the gas is now

σgc = e−β(H−µ ˆN).

µ = µ0 + δµ

µ ˆN = (

µ0 ˆN ) + W

W = V

δµ ˆN ,

The perturbative expansion has to be performed for a ﬁxed value of the mean total number of particles equal to N .
As a consequence the value of the chemical potential µ is not known in advance and has to be adjusted order by order
in the perturbative expansion. To this end, we write

where µ0 is the chemical potential of the ideal Fermi gas having on the mean a number N of particles. This amounts
to performing the following splitting:

where the perturbation is now

In the case of a negative coupling constant g0, both the ﬁrst and second order terms are positive, leading to a spatial

From the comparison with the quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the canonical ensemble, we know the temperature
range over which the second order perturbative expansion gives accurate predictions for g(2)
↑↓ (0). For the grand
canonical ensemble with the same mean number of particles, we expect the same conclusion to apply. We therefore

use a numerical integration of Eq.(43) as a test of existing approximate theories that will be reviewed in sec.VI.
As is apparent in Fig. 9, the density-density RPA is in very good agreement with the perturbative result, whereas
the Ψ†Ψ†
↑↓ (0) and the Nozi`eres-Schmitt-Rink prediction clearly underestimates it. At

which gives for g(2)

ΨΨ RPA overestimates g(2)

↑↓ (0) = 1.

VI. COMPARISON WITH APPROXIMATE THEORIES

For the grand canonical ensemble, several approximate many-body theories exist which can be used to obtain pre-
dictions for the correlation functions of the interacting Fermi gas. In the next subsections, some among the most
famous ones are discussed, namely the mean-ﬁeld BCS theory [10, 11], two versions of the random-phase approxima-
tion (RPA)
[12, 13], and the Nozi`eres-Schmitt Rink (NSR) theory [6] developed to study the BCS-BEC crossover
in strongly interacting gases. A quantitative comparison with the prediction of a grand canonical version of the
perturbative expansion of section V will be performed. In order for the comparison to be meaningful, the many-body
theories under investigation have been specialized to the speciﬁc case of the discrete lattice Hamiltonian (1) with
exacly the same discretization parameters as used in the previous sections.

A. BCS theory

In the BCS theory, the equilibrium density matrix is determined in a self-consistent way from the mean-ﬁeld quadratic

Fock theory. At low temperature T < TBCS, the gap equation is solved for a non-vanishing value of ∆. This value
grows as the temperature decreases.

1. Calculation of correlation functions within the BCS theory

The expansion of the ﬁeld operator (49) in terms of quasi-particle creation and destruction operators can be used
to obtain a prediction for the correlation functions. For instance, the BCS prediction for the one-body correlation

B. Random Phase Approximation

1. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem

A simple way of including the ﬂuctuations around the mean-ﬁeld is to compute a response function within the
mean-ﬁeld theory and then invoke the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theory to obtain the corresponding correlation function.
In this subsection, we shall give a short review of the main results of linear response theory that are required to
obtain the correlation functions of our interacting Fermi gas. A complete discussion of linear response theory and
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem can be found in [10, 26].

Let A and B be two operators of a system characterized by a time-independent Hamiltonian
ieq =

The possibility of having a term in δ(ω) in the correlation function SBA is often neglected in statistical mechanics

2. Density-density RPA

A prediction for the density-density correlation function of the Fermi gas in the grand canonical ensemble can be
obtained by applying the general results of the previous subsection to the operator ˆρσ(x) giving the particle density in
the spin state σ at position x. An approximate prediction for the density-density response functions can be obtained
by linearizing the equations of the mean-ﬁeld theory discussed around the thermal equilibrium state. For historical
reasons, this approximation scheme is usually called random phase approximation (RPA) [12, 13]. For the sake of
simplicity, we shall limit ourselves to the case T > TBCS, regime in which the vanishing of the anomalous averages
considerably improves the physical transparency of the formulas.

Because of the symmetry in the spin space, ˜χ↑↑ = ˜χ↓↓ and ˜χ↑↓ = ˜χ↓↑, so that the eigenvectors of the susceptibility
matrix are the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combination of the two spin states. The corresponding eigenvalues
are:

Conversely, the susceptibility matrix ˜χσσ′ in the σ =

note the sign diﬀerence in the phase factors of (85) and (86). Thanks to the spatial homogeneity of the system,
the susceptibility is diagonal in k-space. From the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation of motion for the anomalous

Eq are the energies of the single-particle states, fq the Fermi

diverges when ˜χ0(k = 0, ω = 0) tends to 1/g0. This is the signature of the approaching of the BCS transition: the

As the chemical potential is a variable that can be continuously varied, all degeneracies between states with diﬀerent

the correction term in δ(ω) vanishes for all other values of µ. As g(1)

need for calculating χtherm(k). We therefore have:

In [6], a non-perturbative calculation is performed for the grand potential of a two component Fermi gas with attractive
interactions by a resummation of a certain class of diagrams.

Starting from Eq. (20) of [6] which gives the grand potential Ω in terms of an integral in the complex plane, we can
deform the integration contour and apply the residues formula to obtain the following expression in terms of a sum
for the case of a contact interaction potential [36]:

The results are plotted in Fig.9. The poor agreement with the perturbative expansion can be explained as follows.
Let us expand Eq.(92) upto second order in g0 at a given µ. If one then replaces µ by its value in the NSR theory
for the density under consideration, one gets from Eq.(94) a prediction for g(2)

Here ρ0(µ) is the total density of the ideal two-component Fermi gas for the chemical potential µ. A ﬁrst order
expansion of Ω is enough to obtain the chemical potential µN SR = µ0 + g0ρ/2 + O(g2
0) in the NSR theory and to
conclude that g(2)
N SR diﬀers from the exact value by a term of the order of g0 which has the same sign as g0. This just
because not all the second order diagrams for Ω have been included in the resummation procedure [37].

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper, we have presented the result of extensive Quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the static
correlation functions of a one-dimensional lattice model of attractively interacting two component fermions. The
numerical results obtained by QMC have been compared to existing approximate theories. Excellent agreement with
the predictions of a perturbative expansion in the interaction constant has been found, as well as with the ones of the
random phase approximation.

Although long-range order is destroyed by phase ﬂuctuations in one-dimensional systems in the thermodynamical
limit, the ﬁnite size of the system under consideration still allows for the identiﬁcation of a crossover to a condensed
state at the temperature T ∗ at which the ﬁrst order coherence length of the pairs becomes larger than the system
size.

We have found that a signiﬁcant degree of opposite spin density-density correlations already exists at temperatures
well above T ∗ and is only slightly enhanced as the temperature goes below T ∗. This means that a measurement of
the density-density correlation function g(2)
↑↓ can not provide an unambiguous signature of the onset of a condensed
state in the gas. On the other hand, this could be provided by a measurement of the second-order momentum space
correlation function as suggested in [25], or, even more directly, of the long-range behaviour of the ﬁrst-order pair

pair(x). A non-vanishing limit of g(1)

coherence function g(1)
pair(x) for large x corresponds in fact to the presence of a ﬁnite
condensate fraction in both weak- (BCS) and strong- (BEC) interaction regimes. A possible experimental scheme to
measure g(1)
pair in atomic Fermi systems by means of matter-wave interferometric techniques will be the subject of a
forthcoming publication.

APPENDIX A: THE MONTE CARLO SAMPLING ALGORITHM

In the present appendix, we describe the numerical algorithm used for the numerical simulations. A Monte Carlo
technique has been used to sample the probability distribution of the initial wavefunctions φ(0)
and the elementary
noise terms ξ(α)

(x).

i

j

As the eﬀective contributions of the diﬀerent realizations to the observables involve the trace of the Hartree-Fock
ansatz σ, i.e. the scalar product between the two N -body Nartree-Fock states, they can have enormously diﬀerent
and ξ(α)
values, so a direct draw of the random variables φ(0)
(x) would be poorly eﬃcient. An importance sampling
scheme [29] has therefore been implemented, using the value of the modulus of the trace at the end τ = β of the
imaginary-time evolution as the a priori probability distribution function P0:

i

In this way, the contributions of the diﬀerent realizations to the trace have the same absolute value, although their
phases are still random.

The parameter η as well as the probability distribution for the random rotation angle θ are free parameters which
can be tuned to optimise the eﬃciency of the simulation. Denoting with P (in)
the value of the a priori
probability for the conﬁgurations respectively before and after the proposed move, this is accepted with a probability
p = min[1, P (ﬁn)
]. As all conﬁgurations can be attained by the random motion and detailed balance is veriﬁed,
the stationary probability distribution of the stochastic process is indeed the desired one P0. If a large enough number
of moves is performed between successive realizations, these can be considered to be statistically independent.

[31] In practice, a numerically more eﬃcient formulation can be obtained from the fact that the total number of spin 1/2
fermions for a given spatial grid with N points has an upper limit of 2N . If one excludes the cases N = 0 and N = 2N ,
one can replace the integrals over θ by discrete sums over the values θ = 2πq/(2N ) where the integer q ranges from 0 to
2N − 1. Furthermore, the symmetry σgc(θ)† = σgc(−θ) may be used to reduce the range of q.

[32] One can take e.g. A = ||V ||(eβ∆E0 − 1)/∆E0 where ∆E0 is the diﬀerence between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues

of H0 − µ0 ˆN and where the norm of V is ||V || ≤ |g0|L/dx2.

[33] Each term of the perturbative expansion is expected to diverge in the T → 0 limit; this can be checked to be the case for
↑↓ (0) in the grand canonical ensemble, this correction diverging as −βg0/L. We therefore

the ﬁrst order correction to g(2)
restrict the perturbative expansion to temperatures larger than |g0|/L ∼ 10 in dimensionless units.

[34] A simpler expression for the denominator of the second order term is ∂µ0 ρ0↑ where ρ0↑ is the density in one spin component

of the ideal Fermi gas with a chemical potential µ0.

[35] A remark useful for the calculations to come is to realize that ˜χBA(ω) has no delta singularity in ω = 0.
[36] Our expression of Ω in terms of a Matsubara sum diﬀers from the unnumbered equation between Eqs. (19) and (20) of [6].
This is due to the omission by the authors of [6] of the contribution to the contour integral of the half-circle of inﬁnite
radius in the Re ω < 0 half plane.

[37] The situation is more subtle in 3D: in the model of [7], the bare coupling constant g0 tends to zero when the cut-oﬀ energy
tends to inﬁnity, in which case the Hartree-Fock mean ﬁeld term in µNSR tends to zero. In this regime, a non-perturbative
resummation procedure then seems unavoidable.

Long-range interaction of two metastable rare-gas atoms

(February 2, 2008)

We present semiempirical calculations of long-range van der Waals interactions for two interacting
metastable rare-gas atoms Ne through Xe. Dispersion coeﬃcients C6 are obtained for homonuclear
molecular potentials asymptotically connecting to the ns(3/2)2 + ns(3/2)2 atomic states. The
estimated uncertainty of the calculated C6 dispersion coeﬃcients is 4%.

Motivated by cold-collision studies of metastable rare-gas atoms [1–4] and prospects of achieving Bose-Einstein
Condensation in these systems [5], we present calculations of long-range dispersion (van der Waals) coeﬃcients for
two atoms interacting in the ns(3/2)2 atomic states (n = 3 for Ne, n = 4 for Ar, n = 5 for Kr, and n = 6 for Xe). The
metastable states have long lifetimes, 43 sec for Xe [6], decaying to the ground 1S0 state by a weak magnetic-quadrupole
transition. With such a long lifetime the metastable atom behaves as an eﬀective ground state in experiments.
Compared to alkali-metal systems, an attractive feature of the noble gas atoms is the availability of isotopes with
zero nuclear spin. The lack of hyperﬁne structure leads to a substantial simpliﬁcation of molecular potentials, though
some complexity arises due to the nonvanishing total electron angular momentum (J=2) of the metastable state.
The anisotropy leads to ﬁfteen distinct long-range molecular states connecting to the ns(3/2)2 + ns(3/2)2 asymptotic
conﬁguration.

Our theoretical treatment of long-range interactions is similar to recent high-precision calculations of van der Waals
coeﬃcients for alkali-metal atoms [7]. By using many-body methods and accurate experimental matrix elements for
the principal transitions, leading dispersion coeﬃcients C6 were determined to an accuracy better than 1% for Na,
K, and Rb, and of 1% for Cs and 1.5% for Fr. The semiempirical values of C6 coeﬃcients for metastable noble-gas
atoms obtained here have an estimated uncertainty of 4%. The approach relies on the determination of dynamic
polarizability functions. To construct the polarizabilities we combine experimental lifetime [8–15] and energy data of
the excited states with accurate semiempirical dynamic polarizabilities of the ground states of noble-gas atoms [16].
The theoretical lifetimes and branching ratios [17] are adjusted to reproduce the measured static polarizabilities [18],
which are known with a 2% uncertainty. We estimated the additional small contributions within the Dirac-Hartree-
Fock framework. The resulting polarizabilities satisfy the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn oscillator strength sum rule.

The Racah notation for atomic levels is used. The particle-hole states are labeled as nℓ(K)J or nℓ′(K)J , where n
and ℓ are the principal and the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the valence electron and K = Jc + ℓ,
where Jc is the angular momentum of the core. The primed conﬁgurations converge to a Rydberg series limit with
a hole in the (n − 1)p1/2 state, and the unprimed to a hole in the (n − 1)p3/2 state. The manifold of the lowest ns
valence states has four ﬁne-structure states ns′(1/2)0,1 and ns(3/2)1,2, and the lowest np manifold consists of ten
states. We investigate here the molecular potentials asymptotically connecting to the ns(3/2)2 atomic states.

We calculate the long-range molecular potentials in the framework of Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory.

The basis functions are deﬁned as products of atomic wavefunctions

|M1M2; Ωi = |ns(3/2)2M1i1|ns(3/2)2M2i2 ,

(1)

where the index 1(2) describes the wavefunction located on the center 1(2) and Ω = M1 + M2, M1,2 being projections
of the atomic total angular momentum on the internuclear axis. Due to the axial symmetry of a dimer Ω is a conserved
quantum number. It takes values ranging from zero to four. The two-atom basis (1) is degenerate and the correct
molecular wavefunctions are obtained by diagonalizing the molecular Hamiltonian

ˆH = ˆH1 + ˆH2 + ˆV (R) .

(2)

In expression (2) ˆHk represent the Hamiltonians of the two non-interacting atoms, and ˆV (R) is the interaction
potential at an internuclear distance R. The energy of the ns(3/2)2 metastable state is designated as E ∗. Then in the
model space (1)

The residual electrostatic potential ˆV (R) is deﬁned as the full Coulomb interaction energy in the dimer excluding
interactions of the atomic electrons with their parent nuclei.

The lowest-order contribution to the term energies arises from the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction ˆVqq, which
varies as 1/R5. However, the corresponding C5 coeﬃcients are only of the order 101 − 102 a.u. [2], and the dominant
contribution appears in the second order in ˆV (R), arising from the dipole-dipole interaction ˆVdd. The second-order
dipole interaction is proportional to 1/R6, and the associated dispersion coeﬃcient C6 is of the order of 104 − 105 a.u..
Applying the formalism of degenerate perturbation theory in second order [21], we obtain an eﬀective Hamiltonian
within the two-atom basis Eq. (1)

The intermediate molecular state |Ψii with unperturbed energy Ei runs over a complete set of two-atom states,
excluding the model-space states Eq. (1). The formalism of the generalized Bloch equation [22] would allow the
inclusion in the model space of the other three atomic states in the ns manifold and would account for the mixing
of the diﬀerent ﬁne-structure levels; but such a large model space is not necessary for R > 10 a.u.. The position of
the avoided level crossing can be estimated from Rl.c. ≈ 2C6/(Ens(3/2)1 − Ens(3/2)2 ) ∼ 10 a.u.. The Ω = 4 molecular
term is unique and being unaﬀected by avoided crossings, the region of applicability is extended to R ∼ n a.u., before
the electronic clouds start to overlap. The eﬀect of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction on the term energy can
be disregarded at values of R ≪ C6/C5 ∼ 103 a.u.. The quadrupole-quadrupole correction is discussed by Doery et
al. [3].

Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, we can represent the matrix element of the dipole-dipole term in the eﬀective

second-order Hamiltonian as

I = 1, 2, 3 are allowed by electric-dipole selection rules.

We proceed now to construct the dipole polarizability functions SI (iω), Eq. (9), evaluate the uncoupled dispersion

coeﬃcients (8), and set and diagonalize the second-order eﬀective Hamiltonian (5).

The functions SI (iω) satisfy several sum rules. In particular, the static tensor dipole polarizability αzz(M ) of the

ns(3/2)2 state may be expressed as

(10)

The static tensor dipole polarizabilities αzz(M = 1) and αzz(M = 2) of metastable noble-gas atoms Ne through Xe
have been measured by Molof et al. [18] to within an error of 2%. In the present calculations the values of SI (0)
are adjusted to reproduce these experimental values. In addition, as ω → ∞, the reduced polarizabilities satisfy the

It is instructive to consider the action of a one-particle operator on the reference particle-hole Slater determinant
ns(3/2)2 in the independent electron approximation. Such an operator can (i) annihilate the reference particle-hole
pair; (ii) promote a valence electron from ns1/2 state to another valence state mp1/2,3/2, the state of the (n − 1)p3/2
hole being unchanged; (iii) deexcite the (n − 1)p3/2 hole into some other hole state, the valence state remaining the
same, and (iv) create another particle-hole pair in addition to the reference pair. According to such a classiﬁcation it
is convenient to break the polarizability function, Eq. (9), into three contributions Sk

where [K] ≡ 2K + 1, the summation is performed over the core orbitals a and excited states m, excluding states of
the lowest np multiplet, and J = 2. The ﬁrst sum is associated with excitation of the valence electron (case (ii)) while
the second sum with deexcitation of the hole state (case (iii)). To arrive at this result we disregarded the coupling
between levels within the same ﬁne-structure multiplet. For example, for Ne the [(2p3/2)−14p1/2]2, [(2p3/2)−14p3/2]2,
and [(2p1/2)−14p3/2]2 states are summed over independently, even though the correct lowest-order wave-function is
a linear combination of them. This approximation corresponds to a disregard of the small diﬀerence between the

We use the semiempirical dynamic polarizabilities for the ground states of noble-gas atoms of Kumar and Meath [16].
The estimated uncertainty of these core polarizabilities is less than 1%. The primary role of the core polarizability
is to provide the correct limit Eq. (11) at ω → ∞. The relative importance of the core-excitation contribution
increases for heavier systems; for example, in a similar calculation for Fr [7], core excitations contribute 23% of the
C6 dispersion coeﬃcient. The high-frequency limit, Eq. (11), is accurately reproduced by the present total reduced
dynamic polarizabilities SI (iω). We obtain for Ne 9.98, for Ar 17.95, for Kr 35.95, and for Xe 53.96 compared to the
nonrelativistically exact values 10, 18, 36, and 54 respectively.

In the ns(3/2)2 = [((n − 1)p3/2)−1ns1/2]2 state core excitations to the occupied magnetic sub-states of the ns1/2
particle state are not allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle, and neither are the core excitations from the empty
magnetic sub-state of the hole (n − 1)p3/2. To remove these transitions from the core polarizability contribution

The largest contribution to the sums SI arises from the intermediate states in the lowest np ﬁne-structure multiplet.

The determination of electric-dipole matrix elements involved in the sum (cid:0)S1

rates and branching ratios in the manifold. The relevant lifetimes have been measured to within an error less than 1%
for Ne [8,9], Ar [10] and Kr [11], and less than 3% for Xe [12–14]. However, the branching ratios B are not established
to the same precision. The most accurate measurements of B in Ne [8,9], have an error bar of approximately 4-5%,
which would introduce an uncertainty of 4-5% in the static polarizabilities, and 8-10% inaccuracy in the values of C6.
To reduce the consequent errors, the experimental values of the static polarizability, accurate to 2%, were chosen as
the reference data.

I(cid:1)np requires a knowledge of both decay

The branching ratios of transitions to the ns(3/2)2 state have been adjusted as follows. The sum S3(0) includes
only one intermediate state in the np manifold, np(5/2)3, and very small ab initio corrections. The np(5/2)3 state
has a single decay channel, so that the sum S3(0) is known with the experimental precision of the decay rate. The
sums S2(0) and S1(0) can be deduced from the experimental values of the static tensor polarizability as

1(cid:1)np (0) and
(cid:0)S1
2(cid:1)np (0) are obtained. The branching ratios B for four states involved in the J = 1 sum and three states in

the J = 2 sum were multiplied by a uniform scaling factor. Branching ratios for Ne [8] for the J = 1 levels were
multiplied by 1.0035, and for the J = 2 level by 0.905 in order to reproduce the experimental values of the static
tensor polarizabilities. We modiﬁed the recommended values of B for Ar [15] by multiplying the branching ratios of
the J = 1 states by 0.973 and of the J = 2 states by 0.965; the values used in the calculations are listed in Table I.
For Kr the velocity-gauge branching ratios, tabulated in Ref. [2] from calculations by Aymar and Coulombe [17],
were multiplied by 1.127 for the J = 1 states and by 1.0016 for the J = 2 states. For Xe, velocity-gauge values of B

4

calculated in Ref. [17] were multiplied by 0.927 for the J = 1 states and by 0.929 for the J = 2 states. The adjusted
data for Ar and Xe are listed in Table I. Doery et al. [2] have compiled the input data for Ne and Kr, which have to
be similarly modiﬁed.

We employ the constructed reduced polarizabilities SI (iω) to calculate the intermediate uncoupled dispersion co-
eﬃcients CJaJb
by quadrature using Eq. (8). The coeﬃcients are listed in Table II. They are to be used if the entire
molecular Hamiltonian, including quadrupole-quadrupole and higher multipoles or perturbation-theory orders is to
be diagonalized. Finally, the molecular terms are obtained by the diagonalization of H (2)
eﬀ , given by Eq. (5). Neglect
of the small corrections due to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction results in parameterization of term energies in
the form

U (R) = 2E ∗ − C6/R6 .

The calculated dispersion coeﬃcients C6 for various molecular symmetries are listed in Table III. Since the region
close to ω = 0 contributes the most to the values of the integral in Eq. (8), the uncertainty in the values of C6 is
approximately 4%, reﬂecting the 2% experimental error in the static dipole tensor polarizabilities [18]. The values
of the C6 coeﬃcients grow monotonically from Ne to Xe, due to the reduction in the energy separations between
the metastable states and the np-manifold. For heavier systems the anisotropy in C6, arising from relativistic eﬀects
becomes increasingly marked, from 6.5% in Ne to 16% in Xe.

Long-range dispersion coeﬃcients for two interacting metastable Ne atoms were evaluated recently by Doery et
al. [3]. The C6 coeﬃcients were calculated from the diagonalization of the molecular dipole-dipole Hamiltonian in the
model space containing the lowest np-manifold, so limiting the intermediate states to the lowest np-manifold states
in the present formulation. Experimental values of decay rates and branching ratios were used to deduce the electric-
dipole matrix elements. The precision of the calculated values of C6 is about 8-10% due to the large uncertainty in
the branching ratios. The values of C6 from Ref. [3] for diﬀerent molecular symmetries vary between 1951 and 1956
a.u., exhibiting much less anisotropy than the present results which range between 1877 and 1999 a.u.. The diﬀerence
can be traced to the anisotropy in the static dipole polarizabilities. Indeed, utilizing input data from Ref. [3] we
obtain αzz(M = 1) = 192 and αzz(M = 2) = 189 a.u.
if we include only the np manifold as in Ref. [3]. While
αzz(M = 1) agrees with the experimental value [18] 192(4), the αzz(M = 2) is overestimated by three standard
deviations compared to the experimental value 180(3) a.u..

The accuracy of the dispersion coeﬃcients could be improved by applying relativistic all-order many-body meth-
ods [23,24] to calculate transition amplitudes between ns − np manifolds. Such ab initio calculations are intrinsically
more challenging than for alkali-metal atoms; the accurate experimental lifetimes would provide an excellent gauge
of accuracy.

Our values of C6 coeﬃcients will be useful in studies of cold collisions of metastable rare-gas atoms [1–4]. For
example, we can estimate the rate coeﬃcient for Penning ionization by ignoring spin-polarization and assuming that
every trajectory that surmounts the angular momentum barrier leads to ionization [1,25]. The corresponding rate
coeﬃcient is given by [25]

k = 6.35 × 10−9 C1/3
6 T 1/6
µ1/2

cm3 s−1 ,

where µ is the reduced mass measured in units of the electron mass and T is the temperature. Combined with
short-range potentials [3,26] a number of other properties could be determined. For example, scattering lengths of
elastic collisions could be found, providing input for mean-ﬁeld equations describing dilute quantum gases.

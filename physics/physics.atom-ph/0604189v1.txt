The properties of the least-bound vibrational level (v = 14) of the 5Σ+

g state formed during
the ultracold collision of two spin-polarized metastable 23S1 helium atoms are crucial to studies of
photoassociation spectroscopy of metastable helium. We report a calculation of the autoionization
lifetime τg of this state induced by spin-dipole coupling of the 5Σ+
g state from which
Penning and associative ionization processes are highly probable. We ﬁnd τg ≈ 150 µs, signiﬁcantly
larger than the recent experimental estimates of (4 − 5) µs.

INTRODUCTION

II. PERTURBATION THEORY

Two-photon photoassociation spectroscopy of ultra-
cold spin-polarized metastable 23S1 helium atoms has
recently been used [1] to accurately measure the bind-
ing energy of the least bound vibrational level (v = 14)
of the 5Σ+
g state formed during the collision of two atoms.
The measured binding energy Eb(v = 14) = 91.35
0.06
MHz, combined with the new ab initio 5Σ+
g potential of
Przybytek and Jeziorski [2], yielded the high precision
0.005 nm for the s-wave scattering
value a = 7.512
length.

Knowledge of the decay width γg of this bound state
is important to the analysis of several experimental tech-
niques used to study photoassociation in metastable he-
lium.
In two-photon photoassociation [1, 3], for the
case where one laser is detuned far from resonance, the
width of the narrow stimulated Raman line is deter-
in dark resonance experi-
mined largely by γg, and,
ments, the incomplete suppression of the photoassocia-
tion signal at the resonance minimum is due to γg. From
these two experiments Moal et al [1] obtain the estimate
0.05 < γg/2π < 0.3 MHz, corresponding to a lifetime τg
between 0.5 and 3 µs. The decay width is also needed
in the interpretation of one-laser photoassociation exper-
iments using calorimetric detection [4, 5, 6] as decay of
the v = 14 bound state contributes to the heating of the
trapped atoms.

Koelemeij and Leduc [3] have given a theoretical es-
timate of τg based upon the semiclassical vibration fre-
quency of the v = 14 level and inelastic decay rates due to
spin relaxation and relaxation-induced ionization [7, 8].
They obtain τg = (4
5) µs, in good agreement with
the measured linewidths. However, these inelastic decay
rates were calculated for initial scattering states in the
5Σ+
g potential, not for a bound vibrational state. In this
paper we shall calculate the decay of the v = 14 bound
state due to relaxation-induced ionization and argue that
there is no contribution from spin-relaxation.

A collision between two atoms with spin quantum num-
bers S1 and S2 involves the total spin state
(S1S2)SMS
i
|
where MS is the projection of S onto the molecular axis.
For metastable helium atoms S1 = S2 = 1 and Penning
and associative ionization processes are forbidden from
quintet state. However, the
the spin-polarized
spin-dipole interaction between the metastable helium
atoms couples the spin-polarized
state to
i
the
electronic spin states. As Pen-
and
ning and associative ionization from the S = 0 singlet
state are highly probable, the spin-dipole induced cou-
pling results in a ﬁnite lifetime of the
state. This
spin-dipole interaction can be treated as a perturbation
and the method presented here is a adaptation of that
given in [9].

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The diﬀerential equations (7) for the unperturbed v =
14 5Σ+
g bound state and (17) for the perturbed function
ga′(r) are solved using a discrete variable representation
and a scaled radial coordinate grid (see [11] and [9] for
details).

As input

to the problem we require the Born-
Oppenheimer potentials for both the 5Σ+
g elec-
tronic states of the metastable helium dimer. For the 5Σ+
g
potential we have used the full (adiabatically and rela-
tivistically corrected) potential V 5

Jeziorski [2] adjusted to match the experimental binding

gauge the sensitivity to the potentials we have also used
the potential V 5
SM(r) of St¨arck and Meyer [12], adjusted
to match the experimental value of the least bound state.
For the singlet potential we use [8] a potential V 1
M con-
structed from the short-range M¨uller et al [13] potential
exponentially damped onto the quintet potential at long
range.

In order to model Penning ionization from the sin-
glet state we use a complex optical potential of the
form V (r)
iΓ(r)/2. Two forms of the ionization width
Γ(r) are used; ΓM(r) obtained from a least squares ﬁt
to the tabulated results in [13] and the simpler form
ΓGMS(r) = 0.3 exp(
r/1.086) advocated in [14]. The
sensitivity of the calculation to the ionization widths was
estimated by assigning a 20% relative uncertainty to both
forms of the width.

×

The coupling between the initial quintet state and the
singlet state produces a complex energy shift ∆Eα =
∆Ere
iγα/2 due to the complex form of the singlet po-
α −
tential. The 1/e lifetime of the least bound v = 14 state
of the 5Σ+
g potential is then τ = ¯h/γα. Using the ad-
justed Przybytek and Jeziorski quintet potential [2] we
obtain (see Table I) values of τ = (1.578+0.201
10−4
−0.116)
s and τ = (1.376+0.108
10−4 s, using the two forms
−0.055)
of the ionization width [13] and [14] respectively. The
superscripted (subscripted) numbers indicate the uncer-
tainty due to a negative (positive) variation of 20% in the
widths. The use of the modiﬁed St¨arck and Meyer quin-
tet potential changes the lifetime (see Table I) by <
2 µs.
∼
We have also studied the sensitivity of the lifetime to re-
alistic variations in the singlet potential. We ﬁnd that
(see Table I) a variation of +2% changes the lifetime by
<
2% was rejected as it reduces
∼
the number of d-wave bound states from 28 to 27). We
note that, for all cases, the real part of the energy shift
increases the binding energy by about 10 kHz.

×

Due to the disparity between our calculated value of
around 150 µs and the observed experimental lifetime of
a few µs [1], we considered if there were other spin-dipole
induced processes which may contribute to the lifetime.
It is our belief that the only possible energy-conserving

transitions from the initial bound state are to the ion-
ization continuum via the singlet state. For example the
d-wave scattering states are much closer than the nearest
lying d-wave bound state in either the singlet or quintet
potential, but have negligible overlap with the v = 14
state due to the centrifugal barrier for l = 2. Due to

the selection rule MS′ + m′ = MS + m = 2, second-
order transitions back to s-wave states with MS < 2 are
forbidden. We believe that the observed lifetime is not
spin-dipole induced but due to some other process such as
exchange of vibrational and translational energy through
atom-molecule collisions.

Enhancement of the electric dipole moment of the electron in the YbF molecule∗

M G Kozlov
Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, Gatchina, Leningrad district, 188350, Russia

We calculate an eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the unpaired electron in the YbF molecule. This ﬁeld
determines sensitivity of the molecular experiment to the electric dipole moment of the electron. We
use experimental value of the spin-doubling constant γ to estimate the admixture of the conﬁguration
with the hole in the 4f-shell of Ytterbium to the ground state of the molecule. This admixture reduces
the ﬁeld by 7%. Our value for the eﬃctive ﬁeld is 5.1 a.u. = 2.5 · 1010 V/cm.

Introduction

It is well known that eﬀects caused by an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron de are strongly enhanced
in heavy diatomic radicals (see, for example, a review [1]). An experimental search for the EDM of the electron
is now underway in Brighton University on the YbF molecule [2]. For this reason the reliable calculations for this
molecule are necessary. The existence of a shallow 4f-shell adds complexity to such calculations. Here we extend the
semiempirical approach suggested in [3,4] to account for a possible admixture of the conﬁguration with the hole in
the 4f-shell of Ytterbium. The idea that f-hole can explain small value of the spin-doubling constant γ belongs to
I. B. Khriplovich [5].

The EDM experiments with radicals are made on the spin-rotational levels of the electronic ground state. The
spin-rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule are described by the following spin-rotational Hamiltonian [6–9]:

Hsr = BN2 + γSN + SAI + WddeSn.

(1)

In this expression N is the rotational angular momentum, B is the rotational constant, S is the spin of the electron and
I is the spin of the Yb nucleus, n is the unit vector directed along the molecular axis from Yb to F. The spin-doubling
constant γ characterizes the spin-rotational interaction. The axial tensor A describes magnetic hyperﬁne structure.
A⊥)/3. The last term in (1) correspond
It can be determined by two parameters: A = (Ak + 2A⊥)/3 and Ad = (Ak −
to the interaction of the EDM of the electron de with the molecular ﬁeld, 1
2 Wd being the eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the
electron.

Parameters B, γ, A and Ad are known from the experiment [10–12]:

B = 7237 MHz,

γ = 13 MHz, A = 7617 MHz, Ad = 102 MHz,

(2)

while Wd have to be calculated. There are three calculations of this parameter [4,13,14]. In earlier calculations [4,13]
4f-shell of Ytterbium was frozen. In [14] f-electrons are included in the valence space, but details of this calculation
are not yet published. Here we allow the admixture of the f-hole to the ground state of the molecule.

Electronic wave function

The ground state of YbF molecule is known to be Σ1/2 [10]. The large hyperﬁne constants A and Ad indicate that
unpaired electron occupies molecular orbital σs with dominant contribution from 6s-orbital and signiﬁcant contribution
of 6p0-orbital of Yb ion. But a simple one-conﬁgurational wave function can not explain an exceptionally small value
of the constant γ. Following Khriplovich we will assume that there is small admixture of the f-hole:

All constants of the Hamiltonian (1) except for the constant B depend only on the electron spin density in the
vicinity of the heavy nucleus. For this reason we can expand molecular orbitals in spherical waves with the origin at

Wave function (3) is written in a pure nonrelativistic coupling case. Spin-orbit interaction Hso mixes state (3)
with Π1/2 states. One can expect that the largest admixtures correspond to the molecular orbitals πp and πf (the

where gn is the nuclear g-factor, α is the ﬁne structure constant, mp is the proton mass and ~α is the vector of Dirac

neglect nondiagonal terms.

Let us start with the nonrelativistic expressions for a spherical wave l

So, in the nonrelativistic approximation only s-wave contributes to the isotropic constant A. Note that the radial
integral in (11) is rapidly decreasing with l, while the coeﬃcient in front of it is a weak function of l.

Interaction of the EDM of the electron with the molecular electric ﬁeld

φ is also singular at the nucleus [15].

The most convenient form of this operator is [16]:

If we neglect the d-wave terms and use the experimental values (2) for A and Ad, we can solve (13) – (15) for xs, xp

where sings of xs and xp are chosen to account for the repulsion of the unpaired electron from the F− ion.

Result (17) is more accurate than one can expect from (13) – (15). It follows from the proportionality between Wd

Wd =

AAd 1/(e cm),

which is based on the behaviour of s- and p-waves in the vicinity of the nucleus where molecular potential is close to
that of the nucleus. In contrast to that, results (16) depend on the assumption that spherical waves in (5) correspond
to the orbitals of Yb+.

Below we calculate several corrections to (17) and (18), which mostly account for contribution of the higher spherical
1, we can solve equations (13) – (15) with the d-wave

waves. If we use the normalization condition x2
included:

d ≈

p

Comparison of (17) and (19) gives the following correction coeﬃcient for the d-wave contribution to Wd:

xs = 0.803; xp = 0.481, xd = 0.356, Wd =

11.2 a.u.

Note that the normalization condition give the upper bound for the coeﬃcient xd. So, it is likely, that (19) and (20)
somewhat overestimate the d-wave contribution.

Within the same approximation we can link this splitting to the constant ξ6,1 and ﬁnd parameter ap:

The only problem here is that molecular state with the πf -hole, which we deﬁne as Π(F ), is not known, and thus
we do not know the energy denominator. The spin-orbit constant for the f-hole has the opposite to normal sign:
ξ4,3 =

3665 cm−1.

Formulae (21), (24) and (25) reduce the number of independent parameters in the wave function (9). Still, it has
two extra parameters δf and εd as compared to the wave function (5) which was used in (13) – (15). Below we
eliminate parameter δf using experimental value of the spin-doubling constant γ.

This equation shows that experimental value of γ correspond to almost complete cancelation between p-wave and
f-wave contributions. To obtain this relation between δf and xp we used ionic spin-orbit constants ξn,l and ionic
denominator in (27). So, we can not expect it to be much better than an order of magnitude estimate.

Spin-orbit and f-hole corrections to Wd

It follows from (11), (27) and (28), that for the molecular state (9) the f-wave contribution to the constant Ad
should be approximately 6 times smaller than that of the p-wave. Indeed, the two contributions to the constant γ
cancel each other, but in (27) there is the factor l(l + 1) which is not present in (11).

It is clear, that correction (31) to isotropic constant A (13) is negligible, while correction to the dipole constant Ad

(14) is about 15% for a given xp, which is in a good agreement with our nonrelativistic estimate 1
6 .

With the f-hole correction (31) included, equation (14) is changed to

In deriving (33) we have ignored the direct f-wave contribution to the constant Wd (see (15)). Such contribution is
proportional to a small product xdδf

0.1 and is less than 1%.

The last correction to the constant Wd is associated with the admixture of the πp state to (9). According to (21)
cp
0.06xp. This admixture changes weights of the p1/2- and p3/2-waves in the wave function. That, in turn,
slightly changes coeﬃcients in (14) and (15) (note, that only p1/2-wave contributes to Wd). A simple calculation give

Discussion

Taking into account (20), (33) and (34), we obtain the total correction factor for Wd to be kcorr = kdkf kso = 0.87.

Applying it to (18), we arrive at

We have calculated corrections to the semiempirical value of the constant Wd of the spin-rotational Hamiltonian (1)
which can account for the P, T -odd eﬀects in YbF molecule. The main correction is caused by the f-hole admixture
to the ground state. Two other corrections account for the spin-orbit interaction and for the d-wave term in the wave
function. Altogether they reduce the answer by more than 10%.

We think that wave function (9) includes two most important conﬁgurations. Admixture of other conﬁgurations
will tend to decrease constant Wd, so we can expect that our value (35) is slightly overestimated. But it is unlikely,
that corresponding corrections are signiﬁcantly larger than those discussed above. So, we estimate the accuracy of
our calculation to be about 20%, which is typical to the semiempirical method.

Ab initio calculation [13] gave smaller absolute value for Wd, but it also underestimated both A and Ad. It is more
informative to compare the coeﬃcient in the equation (18) which correspond to diﬀerent calculations. Our ﬁnal value
1016 1/(e cm). So, in this sense,
for this coeﬃcient is

our result is even smaller than that of [13].

1016 1/(e cm), while results of [13] correspond to

In this paper we have not considered other possible sources of P, T -violation, such as scalar neutral currents [7]
and magnetic quadrupole moment of the nucleus [17]. Corresponding constants WS and WM of the spin-rotational
Hamiltonian can be calculated in a similar way to Wd [4]. Our value for the former constant is: WS =
43 kHz.
Because of the higher multipolarity of the electronic operator associated with the constant WM, this interaction is
much more sensitive to the higher terms of the spherical wave expansion of the molecular wave function. Thus, it is
more diﬃcult to make accurate calculation of this interaction within the semiempirical approach.

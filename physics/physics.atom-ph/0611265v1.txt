Results of a calculation valid to all orders in the nuclear-strength parameter Zα are presented for the two-
loop Lamb shift, notably for the two-loop self-energy correction, for the ground and ﬁrst excited states of
ions with the nuclear charge numbers Z = 60-100. A detailed comparison of the all-order calculation with
earlier investigations based on an expansion in the parameter Zα is given. The calculation removes the largest
theoretical uncertainty for the 2pj-2s transition energies in heavy Li-like ions and is important for interpretation
of experimental data.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Measurements of the 2pj-2s transition energies in heavy Li-like ions [1, 2, 3, 4] have lately reached a fractional accuracy
of 0.03% with respect to the total QED contribution. This corresponds to a 10% sensitivity of the experimental results to the
two-loop QED effects. These measurements provide an excellent possibility for identiﬁcation of the two-loop Lamb shift and for
testing the bound-state QED theory up to second order in α in the strong-ﬁeld regime. Adequate interpretation of experimental
data requires theoretical investigations of the two-loop QED effects valid to all orders in the nuclear-strength parameter Zα.

All-order calculations of the two-loop QED effects and, ﬁrst of all, the two-loop self-energy correction are important also for
low-Z ions because of a very slow convergence of the corresponding Zα expansion. The higher-order (in Zα) two-loop QED
effects presently yield the second largest uncertainty in the theoretical prediction for the ground-state Lamb shift in hydrogen
(after the proton charge distribution effect). Improved theoretical results for the 1s and 2s Lamb shift will be required in the
near future for a more precise determination of the Rydberg constant, when an improved value for the proton charge radius is
obtained from the muonic hydrogen experiment [5].

The complete set of two-loop one-electron QED corrections (also referred to as the two-loop Lamb shift) is graphically
represented in Fig. 1. In this investigation, we will be mainly concerned with the two-loop self-energy correction represented
by diagrams (a)-(c), which will be evaluated rigorously to all orders in Zα. The other diagrams in Fig. 1 will be calculated as
well; diagrams (d)-(g), rigorously and diagrams (h)-(k), within the free-loop approximation, i.e., keeping the leading term of
the expansion of fermion loops in terms of the binding potential. In the one-loop case, the free-loop approximation corresponds
to the Uehling potential and yields the dominant contribution even for high-Z ions like uranium. We assume that the free-loop
approximation is reasonably adequate in the two-loop case also.

The two-loop self-energy correction to the energy shift is conveniently represented in terms of the dimensionless function

F (Zα) deﬁned (in relativistic units ~ = c = 1) by

where n is the principal quantum number. The Zα expansion of the function F reads

F (Zα) = B40 + (Zα) B50 + (Zα)2

L3 B63 + L2 B62 + L B61 + Gh.o.(Zα)

where L = ln[(Zα)−2] and Gh.o. is a non-perturbative remainder whose expansion starts with a constant, Gh.o.(Zα) = B60 +
Zα (· · · ) .

The leading term in Eq. (2), B40, is related to the free-electron form-factors and is known for a long time. Its ﬁrst complete
evaluation was reported in [6]. The next term B50 was calculated only relatively recently by Pachucki [7] and by Eides and
Shelyuto [8]. The result for the leading logarithmic contribution, B63, was ﬁrst reported in [9]. A considerable discussion
about the correctness of the method of derivation followed this publication (see [10] and references therein). Finally, this result
was rigorously re-derived by Pachucki in [11]. In that work, Pachucki also derived the remaining logarithmic terms for ns
states, B62(ns) and B61(ns). An additional contribution to the coefﬁcient B61(1s) was recently identiﬁed and evaluated in
[12]. The coefﬁcient B62 for np states was calculated in [13]. The values of B61 for states with l ≥ 1 as well as the differences

B60(ns)− B60(1s) and B60(npj)− B60(npj) were recently presented in [12]. There are no complete results available at present
for the coefﬁcient B60 for single states. However, its non-relativistic part bL (also termed as the two-loop Bethe logarithm) was
calculated for 1s and 2s states in [14] and later for higher excited states in [15, 16]. This part presumably yields the dominant
contribution to B60; the uncertainty due to uncalculated terms was estimated in [14] to be 15% for the 1s and 2s states.

We note that the formulas (10), (11) for the two-loop self-energy correction were obtained from the full two-loop results in [12]
by subtracting the contribution due to diagrams with closed fermion loops, which is [18]

We now turn to our calculation of the two-loop self-energy correction to all orders in Zα. The starting point of our consider-
ation is the Furry picture, where the interaction of an electron with the nucleus is taken into account to all orders right from the
beginning. As a consequence of this choice, we have to deal with the bound-electron propagators, whose structure is much more
complicated than that of the free-electron propagators. A method for the evaluation of the two-loop self-energy correction was
developed for the ground state in our previous studies [19, 20]. In the present investigation, we extend it to the excited states.
The general procedure for isolation and cancelation of ultraviolet and infrared divergences is similar to that for the 1s state,
but the actual calculational scheme requires substantial modiﬁcations due to a more complicated pole and angular-momentum
structure of expressions involved. Details of our calculation are cumbersome and will be published elsewhere; in this paper we
concentrate on presentation and analysis of the results obtained and discuss their experimental consequences.

We performed our all-order calculations of the two-loop self-energy correction for the 1s, 2s, 2p1/2, and 2p3/2 states of ions
with Z = 60, 70, 83, 92 and 100. The results can be conveniently expressed in terms of the higher-order remainder Gh.o. deﬁned
by Eq. (2). The values of the remainder as a function of Z are plotted in Fig. 2 for the 1s and 2s states and in Fig. 3 for the
2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states. The results for the 1s state and Z < 60 are taken from our previous investigation [20] (the points with
Z = 10 and 15 are omitted because of large numerical uncertainty). We present separate graphs for individual states and for the
differences ∆h.o.
p = Gh.o.(2p3/2) − Gh.o.(2p1/2). On the ordinate axis of the graphs, the
limiting values of the higher-order remainder at Z = 0 are indicated, as obtained within the Zα-expansion approach. The status
of these limiting values is different for single states and for the differences ∆h.o.
. For the single states, the limiting
values represent incomplete results for the coefﬁcients B60 given by Eqs. (13) and (14). The error bars indicated for the 1s and
2s states correspond to the 15% uncertainty suggested in [14]. For 2p states, the uncertainty is undeﬁned, although it is believed
to be signiﬁcantly smaller than the two-loop Bethe logarithm. For the differences ∆h.o.
, the limiting values are known
much better and given by Eqs. (15) and (16).

Characterizing the comparison presented in Fig. 2, we observe that our all-order results do not seem to agree well with the the
analytical results to order α2(Zα)6 for 1s and 2s states separately whereas a rather good agreement is found for the difference
∆h.o.
. For the 2pj states presented in Fig. 3, the situation is even less deﬁnite, due to smaller numerical values of the higher-order
s
remainder function. But we again observe that agreement for the difference ∆h.o.
is much better than for the single states. It
should be mentioned that the agreement observed for the differences is a valuable evidence in favor of reliability of our all-
order results. The reason is that numerical evaluations for different single states are completely independent and individual
contributions, e.g., to the functions F (1s) and F (2s) are even of different orders of magnitude. It is thus very unlikely that a
contribution appears in numerical evaluations that vanishes identically in the difference, which is contrary to the situation in the
Zα-expansion calculations.

Assuming correctness of both the all-order and the Zα-expansion calculation, we can surmise two possible explanations of
the situation observed. The ﬁrst possibility is that uncalculated contributions to the coefﬁcients B60 for single states are larger
than previously expected and, when calculated, they will shift the limiting values Gh.o.(Z = 0) in Figs. 2 and 3 considerably.
The second possibility is that remarkably large logarithmic terms appear in the Zα expansion to order α2(Zα)7 and induce a
very rapidly varying structure in the Z dependence of the remainder Gh.o.(Z) in the low-Z region. The both scenarios will have
a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the theoretical values of the higher-order two-loop QED effects for the 1s and 2s states in hydrogen.

III. TWO-LOOP LAMB SHIFT IN LI-LIKE IONS

The best opportunity for experimental identiﬁcation of the two-loop QED effects in the strong binding ﬁeld is presently offered
by measurements of the 2pj-2s transition energies in Li-like ions. In this work, we present results of our calculations of all two-
loop corrections depicted in Fig. 1 for the 2p3/2-2s transition in Bi80+ and the 2p1/2-2s transition in U89+, for which most
accurate experimental data are available. Numerical results for individual subsets of diagrams deﬁned in Fig. 1 are presented in
Table I under the entry “Two-loop QED”. The SESE subset represents the two-loop self-energy correction, which is the main
result of our investigation. The SEVP(d-f) diagrams and the VPVP(g) diagram were calculated to all orders in Zα without any
approximations involved, whereas the VPVP(h,i) and S(VP)E diagrams were evaluated within the free-loop approximation, i.e.,
keeping the ﬁrst nonvanishing contribution in the expansion of the fermion loops in terms of the binding potential. The error
bars speciﬁed for these corrections are estimations of uncertainty due to the approximation employed. They were obtained by
multiplying the contribution of diagrams (h,i) by a factor of (Zα)2 and that of diagram (k) – by a factor of 3 (Zα). The factor
of 3 (Zα) in the latter estimation arises as a ratio of the leading-order contribution beyond the free-loop approximation for the
diagram (k), −0.386 (α/π)2(Zα)5 [21], and the leading-order contribution within this approximation, 0.142 (α/π)2(Zα)4 [22].
The ﬁnite nuclear size effect was taken into account in our evaluation of the diagrams (d)-(i), whereas the other diagrams were
calculated for the point nuclear model. In the case of uranium, our results for the diagrams with closed fermion loops are in
good agreement with those reported previously [23, 24, 25, 26].

We now explain the other theoretical contributions to the transition energies presented in Table I. The entry labeled “Dirac
value” represents the transition energies as obtained from the Dirac equation with the nuclear potential induced by the standard
two-parameter Fermi nuclear-charge distribution. Numerical values for the nuclear-charge root-mean-square (rms) radii were
taken from [27], <r2>1/2= 5.851(7) Fm for uranium and 5.521(3) Fm for bismuth. The dependence of the Dirac value on
the nuclear model was conservatively estimated by comparing the results obtained within the Fermi and the homogeneously-
charged-sphere models, as ﬁrst suggested in [28]. We have checked that a wide class of more general models for the nuclear-
charge distribution yields results well within the error bars obtained in this way.

The next 3 lines contain the corrections due to the one-, two-, and three-photon exchange, respectively. QED values for the
two-photon exchange correction were taken from our previous evaluations [29, 30]. The results for the three-photon exchange

6

correction were obtained in this work within many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), with retaining the Breit interaction to the
ﬁrst order only. For uranium, we report good agreement with the previous evaluations of this effect [31, 32]. The error ascribed
It was estimated by calculating
to the three-photon exchange correction is due to incompleteness of the MBPT treatment.
the third-order MBPT contribution with two and more Breit interactions for each state involved in the transition, adding these
contributions quadratically, and multiplying the result by a conservative factor of 2.

The entry labeled “One-loop QED” represents the sum of the ﬁrst-order self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections
calculated on hydrogenic wave functions [33]. The next line (“Screened QED”) contains the results for the screened self-
energy and vacuum-polarization corrections [34, 35, 36]. The uncertainty ascribed to this entry is the estimation of higher-order
screening effects; it was obtained by multiplying the correction by the ratio of the entries “Screened QED” and “One-loop QED”.
The last two lines contain the values for the relativistic recoil correction [37, 38] and the nuclear polarization correction [39, 40].
The comparison presented in Table I demonstrates that our total results agree well within the error bars speciﬁed with the
experimental data for bismuth and uranium. The theoretical accuracy is signiﬁcantly better in the former case, which is the
consequence of the fact that the ﬁnite nuclear size effect is smaller and the nuclear radius is known better. Our result for the
2p3/2-2s transition in bismuth can also be compared with the value of 2787.96 eV obtained by Sapirstein and Cheng [41]. The
difference of 0.16 eV between the results is mainly due to the two-loop Lamb shift contribution (0.12 eV) which is not accounted
for in Ref. [41].

We conclude that inclusion of the two-loop Lamb shift is necessary for adequate interpretation of the experimental result in
the case of bismuth, whereas for uranium the two-loop Lamb shift is signiﬁcantly screened by the uncertainty due to the nuclear
charge distribution. Comparison of the theoretical and experimental results for bismuth yields the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of the two-
loop QED effects in the region of strong binding ﬁeld, which is a step toward the test of the strong-ﬁeld regime of bound-state
QED at the two-loop level.

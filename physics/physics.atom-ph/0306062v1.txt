We report bunching, slowing, and acceleration of a supersonically cooled beam of diatomic hy-
droxyl radicals (OH). In situ observation of laser-induced ﬂuorescence along the beam propagation
path allows for detailed characterization of longitudinal phase-space manipulation of OH molecules
through the Stark eﬀect by precisely sequenced inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds.

The advent of laser cooling and Bose-Einstein conden-
sation has transformed atomic physics [1]. Molecules,
with their richer internal structure, oﬀer many new ex-
citing research opportunities. Cold molecules can be used
for novel collision studies, molecular optics and interfer-
ometry, quantum collective eﬀects, quantum information
science, long-range intermolecular states, precision spec-
troscopy and measurements, and investigations of chem-
istry in the ultracold regime. At the present stage of de-
velopment, cold molecular samples are beginning to be
produced and even conﬁned within traps [2, 3, 4]. The
revolutionary role played by cold atoms to the ﬁeld of
atomic physics may be duplicated by cold molecules to
the ﬁeld of physical chemistry and physical science over-
all.

The complex structure of molecular energy levels has
so far precluded a straightforward implementation of
laser cooling. Photo-association [5] and Feshbach res-
onance association of cold atoms [6] represent eﬀective
approaches to create cold diatomic molecules, but the
techniques are limited to a small class of laser-cooled
atoms. Molecules can also be cooled by thermalization
with cryogenically refrigerated buﬀer gas, at a small cost
of system complexity [3]. Working with molecules gen-
erated by supersonic expansion has a deﬁnite advantage:
the internal - rotational and vibrational - degrees of free-
dom of the molecules are cooled and, primarily, only the
ground state is populated. Furthermore, the transla-
tional temperature of the molecular beam is vastly re-
duced in its moving frame. Subsequently, the velocity
of the molecules in the laboratory frame can be manipu-
lated by an elegant method, which takes advantage of the
Stark shift associated with polar molecules [7, 8]; inho-
mogeneous pulsed electric ﬁelds controlled with a precise
timing sequence may be used to selectively bunch, slow,
or accelerate the molecules and accumulate them in an
ultralow temperature phase space distribution.

In this Letter we demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach for the diatomic hydroxyl radical (OH). The
selection of the hydroxyl radical comes from both its ex-
tensive relevance to astrophysics [9] and physical chem-
istry [10, 11] as well as its particular amenability to
the Stark slowing technique. Recent theoretical studies
have also revealed particularly interesting prospects for
study of cold collisions and controlled interactions be-
tween OH molecules [12]. These molecules possess per-
manent electric dipole moments that bring new opportu-
nities for control over intermolecular interactions. When
the translational energy becomes comparable to or less
than the intermolecular dipole-dipole interaction energy,
polar molecules easily inﬂuence each other’s trajectory
and orientation, leading to complex dynamics. An exter-
nal applied ﬁeld can manipulate the intermolecular inter-
action: for example, molecules can be made to collide (or
not) on command, by varying the ﬁeld strength with re-
spect to the distance-dependent intermolecular dipole in-
teractions. This mechanism represents a profoundly dif-
ferent type of control over collisions than resonant scat-
tering controlled by a magnetic ﬁeld. Additionally, the
OH molecule possesses a large magnetic moment and is
suitable for magnetic trapping.
It will be particularly
interesting to explore variable control of electric ﬁelds
to manipulate intermolecular interactions in a magnetic
trap. Furthermore, with the existence of a cold, trapped
sample, the small mass of OH radicals should aid a di-
rect laser cooling eﬀort through vibrational transitions
around 2.8 µm, as cycling through the lowest vibrational
transition requires only three repumping lasers. Addi-
tionally, we note practical, limited laser cooling along
relatively radiatively closed electronically excited path-
ways is possible for OH.

A roadblock for cold molecular experiments is the
need to develop and implement means to detect,
im-
age, and characterize small samples of cold molecules

once they are trapped. This is a prerequisite for ex-
ploring molecular condensates, coherent atom-molecule
conversion, cold molecule collisions, and ultracold chem-
istry. For this purpose, an important feature of using
OH radicals is ease of detection through laser-induced
ﬂuorescence (LIF). Resonance ﬂuorescence has been de-
veloped as a highly sensitive technique for detecting small
numbers of molecules. By counter-propagating a LIF
laser beam along the molecular beam path, we can make
deﬁnitive in situ observations of the molecular popula-
tion, density, and velocity distribution at various posi-
tions within the decelerator, leading to a clear picture of
longitudinal phase space evolution.

It is notably diﬃcult to adapt the supersonic expan-
sion technique that accommodates eﬃcient production
of cold, ground state free radicals via discharge or pho-
tolysis and still remain suitable for the Stark manipula-
tion approach, which relies on the propagation of a near-
collimated molecular beam through inhomogeneous elec-
tric ﬁelds. We utilize a high-voltage (∼ 3kV) discharge
to create OH radicals. Figure 1 shows the experimen-
tal setup along with the detected OH signals along the
beam path. Xenon (Xe) gas bubbles through a small tank
of distilled water with a backing pressure of 2.5 atmo-
spheres. The pulsed valve has a 0.5 mm diameter nozzle
and is operated at a 5 Hz repetition rate, producing a su-
personic beam with pulse widths of < 100 µs. Two thin
stainless steel disks, electrically isolated from each other
and from earth ground, act as discharging electrodes with
electrons ﬂowing against the expanding supersonic jet
through the central 4 mm opening. Experimentally we
ﬁnd operating the discharge voltage in a pulsed mode
with a ∼2 µs duration signiﬁcantly reduces undesirable
heating of the molecular beam. The measured mean ve-
locity of the beam and the associated spread are 370 m/s
± 60 m/s, consistent with a near room temperature, Xe-
seeded supersonic expansion, where the operation of the
pulsed valve and discharge has contributed only slight
heating to the molecules. Another beneﬁt of the short
discharging pulse is that the production of OH molecules
is well deﬁned both in time (< 2 µs) and position (<
2 mm). Trace (a) in the lower panel of Fig. 1 shows
a corresponding discharge light signal that deﬁnes the
origin for all timing axes in the subsequent data ﬁgures
throughout this Letter. State-selective ﬂuorescence de-
tection determines that greater than 93% of OH created
are in the rotational and vibrational ground state (v =0,
J = 3/2) of X2Π3/2. Within this state, the symmetrical
“f” component is a weak-ﬁeld seeking state with two ﬁne
structure levels of which the |mj| =3/2 component oﬀers
three times the Stark shift of the |mj| =1/2.

After traversing a 1.5 mm aperture skimmer, which
is charged (-300V) in order to prevent ions generated
in the discharge from reaching the slower, the molecular
beam is focused into the Stark decelerator [7] by a short

2

hexapole. The linear accelerator is formed by 69 pairs
of 3.2 mm diameter rounded stainless steel rods with a
center-to-center separation of 5.2 mm, allowing a 2 ×
2 mm2 transverse acceptance area. Pairs of electrodes
deﬁne individual slowing stages. Successive stages are
separated by a center-to-center distance of 5.5 mm and
are oriented alternately at 90◦ relative to each other in
order to provide transverse guiding. At the end of the
decelerator an electric quadrupole trap is located ∼10
mm from the last decelerator stage.

A frequency-doubled pulsed dye laser (∼ 10 ns pulse
duration) is tuned resonant with the A2Σ+(v=1)←
X2Π3/2 (v=0) transition at 282 nm for ﬂuorescence de-
tection at 313 nm A2Σ+(v=1)→ X2Π3/2 (v=1) (life-
time τ =750 ns). The laser beam is introduced through
the 2 mm diameter apertures centered on the end caps
of the quadrupole trap into the decelerator region. The
laser beam counter-propagates down the entire slower
through the skimmer and into the valve region. By de-
sign, the vacuum chamber has large solid-angle optical
access for ﬂuorescence collections at multiple positions
along the molecular beam path. The sensitivity of the
ﬂuorescence measurement is enhanced by the favorable
72% branching ratio into the detection decay channel.
To suppress scattered laser light, we gate the photomul-
tiplier tube during the excitation laser pulse and collect
ﬂuorescence signals only during the subsequent microsec-
ond scale decay lifetime. The detected ﬂuorescence sig-
nals are converted to the corresponding molecular num-
bers using carefully calibrated parameters such as laser
intensity, photon detection eﬃciency, decay branching ra-
tio, etc. Along with the present LIF approach, we are
developing a phase-contrast, cavity-enhanced detection
technique with an aim toward study of cold molecule dy-
namics in a non-destructive manner.

Following conventions used in linear accelerator
physics (for a more detailed discussion, see Ref.
[7, 8]),
we deﬁne a local spatial coordinate for a molecule lo-
cated between two successive stages φ = z
2L 2π, with
z =0 deﬁned at the center of the two stages when the
voltages are switched. A molecule that is accelerated
or decelerated has a diﬀerent equilibrium position φ0
than that of a constant speed molecule, which has φ0 =
0◦. The corresponding depth of the travelling potential
well decreases as the magnitude of φ0 increases. With
∆φ = φ − φ0 denoting spatial spread and ∆ν = ν − ν0
velocity spread around the synchronous molecules lo-
cated at the equilibrium position of the moving trap,
the following equations describe the overall phase space
evolution: d
mL2 [sin(φ0 + ∆φ) − sin(φ0)] = 0, ∆ν =
d∆φ
dt . Here m is the molecular mass and W denotes the

To demonstrate the powerful capability of in situ de-
tection of molecules within the decelerator for the study
of phase space manipulation, we select ﬁve representative

ﬁrst decelerator stage, (d) between the 23rd and 24th
stages, (e) between 37th and 38th, and (f) between 50th
and 51st. Detection at regions (b) and (c), with the
corresponding signals shown in the lower panel of Fig.
1, allows for optimization of OH production from the
valve, discharge, and hexapole focusing. Experimentally
we optimize the magnitude and duration of the applied
hexapole voltage for a selected velocity class in order to
provide transverse phase-space matching into the decel-
erator. Applying static voltage to the decelerator elec-
trodes transversely guides the molecular beam. The LIF
signals detected at (d), (e) and (f), such as those shown
in Fig. 1, are obtained with ±12.5 kV guiding voltages
applied to all stages, resulting in a >10× signal enhance-
ment. In all traces shown, the electric ﬁelds are switched
oﬀ prior to molecular detection.

Given good spatial resolution in signal collection, the
LIF signal, presented with respect to the time-of-ﬂight
through the selected detection region, reveals the lon-
gitudinal spatial and velocity distributions, which are
input parameters for our model of the Stark manipu-
lation process. We image a 2 mm-long beam section lo-
cated between two successive pairs of electrodes onto the
PMT, with a magniﬁcation of 2.7 to aid spatial ﬁltering.
Figure 2 shows time-of-ﬂight LIF signals observed after
14 stages of inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds switched with
precise timing, followed by 9 additional stages of static
transverse guiding. Fig. 2(a) depicts the transversely
guided molecular packet. With the electric ﬁelds having
the same magnitude and conﬁguration as in the static
guiding case except that the voltages are now switched
at a frequency matching ν/2L, bunching of molecules
is demonstrated in Fig. 2(b). Here ν is the mean ve-
locity of the molecular packet (375 m/s) and L is the
distance between the successive, orthogonally oriented

stages. The switching eﬀectively creates travelling poten-
tial wells in which molecules are trapped, producing the
central bunched peak marked by the arrow in the ﬁgure.
Other peaks and valleys visible in trace (b) are created
by phase-space open trajectories of untrapped molecules.
By chirping the switching frequency, the molecules’ speed
can be increased to 421 m/s [Fig. 2(c)] or decreased to
323 m/s [Fig. 2(d)], depending on the sign of the fre-
quency chirp; this results in the central molecular peak
arriving earlier (when accelerated) or later (when slowed)
in time, relative to the bunched peak. Clearly, the in
situ detection capability has allowed us to simultane-
ously monitor, stage by stage, the trapped and untrapped
molecular dynamics, showing temporal transportation of
the untrapped molecules as theoretically investigated in
[13]. Our theoretical simulations (see discussions below)
account for these dynamics in a detailed manner.

Theoretical simulations are derived from detailed un-
derstanding of the Stark slower and OH molecules. From
the measured geometrical and electrical properties (sizes,
distances, and applied voltages), an electric ﬁeld map is
constructed, which when coupled with understanding of
the OH energy structure (including both |mj| = 3/2 and
1/2 levels, with a mixing ratio of 3:1 resulting from the
initial hexapole selection), gives complete information on
the forces experienced by OH molecules within the decel-
erator region. The initial 1-D phase space distribution is
inferred from the static guiding data, then propagated
through the Stark manipulation process resulting in a
phase space distribution similar to those of Fig. 3(c) and
(d). This distribution is integrated to produce a time-
of-ﬂight spectra that is compared directly to the experi-
mental data as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b).

The LIF experimental conﬁguration is particularly
suitable to visualize eﬀects described by the equations
given above. Molecular packets with known initial veloc-
ities can be decelerated using a pre-determined number of

stages, then allowed to free ﬂy through a certain distance
under only transverse guidance. Subsequent LIF detec-
tions reveal the ﬁnal phase space distribution, which is
related to the decelerated state via a free ﬂight convo-
lution matrix. A more direct observation of the phase
space manipulation by the slowing stages is achieved by
collecting LIF signals immediately following the deceler-
ation process. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show two cases where
the LIF detections are made after 22 and 36 stages of
deceleration at φ0 = 75◦, followed by one stage of free
ﬂight. Corresponding theoretical simulations are shown
as solid lines for both panels. The simulations conﬁrm
that the largest peak at 1.02 ms in Fig. 3(b) is associated
with the |mj| =3/2 state and the second peak at 1.05
ms for |mj| =1/2. The simulation results are obtained
from the phase space distribution contours shown in the
corresponding panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 3, which also
includes a color-coded scale bar for normalized molecu-
lar numbers. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3(c), the
initial phase space distribution (∆v: 250 - 500 m/s; ∆z:
0.09 - 0.17 m) at the input of the decelerator is a re-
sult of molecular free ﬂight from the nozzle. Simulations
are carried out with no free parameters except a global
scaling factor. The thickness of the simulation curves
signiﬁes the measurement uncertainty of the geometrical
dimensions of the entire decelerator (±1 mm over 40 cm),
without taking into account other real-time ﬂuctuations
in switch timing, laser intensity, and molecular numbers.
Nevertheless the agreement between simulations and ex-
perimental data is excellent.

In the ﬁrst case of 22 stages of deceleration, there are
ﬁve distinct spatially separated distributions in Fig. 3(c),
labelled respectively as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These distribu-
tions ﬂy through the detection zone indicated by vertical
blue lines, leading to the observed LIF signals shown in
Fig. 3(a). It is clear from Fig. 3(c) that packet 1 repre-
sents the trapped molecules that have migrated from the
original phase space distribution. The projected velocity
distribution associated with 1 is also shown near the right
vertical axis, indicating a 7 m/s velocity spread. When
the deceleration process is carried to the 36th stage, the
mean velocity of the molecular packet is further reduced,
along with additional rotation of the phase space dis-
tribution, as shown in Fig. 3(d), leading to a narrower
velocity spread of 4.4 m/s. Part of the reduction of the
velocity width is attributed to the departure of untrapped
molecules from the packet, as shown in both experimen-
tal data and simulations.

Finally, as shown in Fig. 4, when the deceleration pro-
cess is continued to the 50th stage, the slow molecular
packet (red circles) (φ0 = 75◦) has now been completely
decelerated out of the transversely guided molecular dis-
tribution (green diamonds). The phase-stable molecular
packet has been decelerated to 140 m/s with a velocity
spread of 2.7 m/s, corresponding to a longitudinal tem-

perature of 15 mK. Simulations again conﬁrm the po-
sition and width of the measured packet, which is now
solely attributed to the |mj| = 3/2 state. The bunched
peak (black squares) (φ0 = 0◦) appears 0.3 ms earlier
than the slowed packet in the measured time-of-ﬂight dis-
tribution.

In conclusion, we have presented clear evidence for
the ﬁrst time of longitudinal phase space manipulations
of free radical molecules, demonstrating bunching, slow-
ing, and acceleration of a ground rovibrational state of
OH. The experimental approach presented here has led
to an excellent understanding of the associated physical
processes and will have a major impact on future cold
molecule work where in situ detections can be critical
for observations of cooling and trapping dynamics.

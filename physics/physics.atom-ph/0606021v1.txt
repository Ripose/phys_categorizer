Strong-ﬁeld ionization of atoms and molecules: The two-term saddle point method

Thomas Kim Kjeldsen and Lars Bojer Madsen
Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Aarhus, 8000 ˚Arhus C, Denmark

We derive an analytical formula for the ionization rate of neutral atoms and molecules in a
strong monochromatic ﬁeld. Our model is based on the strong-ﬁeld approximation with transition
amplitudes calculated by an extended saddle point method. We show that the present two-term
saddle point method reproduces even complicated structures in angular resolved photo electron
spectra.

INTRODUCTION

In order to describe fully the dynamics of molecules
and atoms subject to an external laser ﬁeld, one must in
principle solve the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation
including all degrees of freedom. Such ab initio solutions
are, however, impossible for any but the most simple
systems, and additionally these methods are often only
available for a few specialized theoretical research groups.
Fortunately much physical insight can be achieved by
simpler models. For example, many strong-ﬁeld phe-
nomena can be successfully interpreted if one uses the
Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling model [1] to
describe ionization. The success and the analytical sim-
plicity makes the ADK model ideal for widespread use
not only for atoms but also for diatomic [2] and poly-
atomic [3] molecules.

Along with the ADK model, the strong-ﬁeld approxi-
mation (SFA) is one of the most widely used models to
describe detachment of anions and ionization of atoms
in intense laser ﬁelds. Compared with the ADK model,
the SFA is more suited for obtaining angular and energy
resolved spectra. The two models are in fact connected
since the tunneling rate can be obtained from the SFA
in the low frequency limit [4, 5]. The initial work by
Keldysh [6] concerned ionization of hydrogen. The model
was further developed by Faisal and Reiss [7, 8] and
is commonly known as the Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR)
model. Later on, the model was extended in various ways
(see Ref. [9] for a recent review), e.g., to take into account
rescattering [10, 11], long range Coulomb potential in the
ﬁnal state [12], multiple electrons [13, 14] and molecular
structure [15]. More systematically, for short-ranged ﬁ-
nal state interactions the SFA transition amplitude is the
leading term in an exact S -matrix series [8, 9].

In order to evaluate the matrix elements that enter
the expression for the ionization rate in the SFA, one
may use the saddle point method to obtain approximate
closed analytical formulas. The saddle point method can
be applied in both the length- and velocity gauge.
In
the velocity gauge, the saddle point method breaks down
at intensities below 1013 W/cm2 [16]. Despite its wide-
spread and long-term use – already Keldysh applied the
saddle point method in the initial work concerned with
the limit of small momenta of the outgoing electron and

Ref. [17] reviews other limiting formulas – we are not
aware of a similar study of the limitation of the saddle-
point method in the length gauge. The main purpose
of the present paper is to provide a detailed discussion
of the applicability of the saddle point method in neu-
tral atoms and to extend the theory to cover molecules.
In this eﬀort, we identify a straightforward extension of
the conventional saddle point method. We call the ex-
tended theory the ’two-term’ saddle point method, and
we show that the present method increases the accuracy
considerably.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we outline
the theory. In Sec. III we test the accuracy of the saddle
point method by presenting result on various atoms and
molecules. Section IV concludes.

II. THEORY

The saddle point method gives very accurate results
for detachment rates of negative ions [5, 18] and a sad-
dle point formula that covers also neutral atoms, irre-
spectively of the value of the momentum of the outgoing
electron, is known [5]. The application of the latter for-
mula, however, was not considered until recently [19, 20].
The theory outlined here follows closely the derivation of
Ref. [5]. The diﬀerences are that (i) we take into account
molecular structure, and (ii) the previous theory only in-
cluded one term in saddle-point evaluation of a particular
integral, whereas we keep two terms to increase the ac-
curacy and range of applicability [see Eq. (14) below].
Equations (1)-(4) below summarize the basic formulas
from Ref. [5] and are included here for completeness.

In the single-active-electron approximation, we con-
sider the direct transition of the electron in an initially
bound state Ψ0 to a continuum state Ψq due to the lin-
early polarized laser ﬁeld F (t) = F0 cos(ωt) with the pe-
riod T = 2π/ω. We quote the expression for the angular
diﬀerential ionization rate (atomic units ~ = me =

minimum number of photons nmin must be absorbed. In
the SFA, the interaction between the ﬁeld and the elec-
tron in the initial state Ψ0(r, t) is neglected and accord-
ingly Ψ0(r, t) = Φ0(r) exp (iEbt), where Φ0(r) is the sta-
tionary solution of the ﬁeld-free Schr¨odinger equation.
Additionally, interactions between the residual ion and
the continuum electron are neglected in the ﬁnal state

The time integral of Eq. (7) follows obviously the real
t axis. From Eq. (7) and the convergence of the hyperge-
omtric function, we see that the integrand is an analytical
function of t except at complex instants of time satisfying

[q + A(t)]2 = Q(t)2 =

κ2,

(9)

−

where ˜Φ0[q + A(t)] is singular. These points coincide
with the saddle points S′(t) = 0 in the factor eiS(t).
We discuss the complex momentum in appendix A and
refer to Refs. [5, 11] for the analytical properties and
evaluation of the spherical harmonics on a complex vec-
tor. The continuation to the complex t plane is straight-
forward as long as we remember to treat the singulari-
ties with care. Note that the singularities vanish when
ν = Z = 0 corresponding to detachment of negative
ions.
In Fig. 1 we show the integrand of Eq. (7) for
a typical set of laser parameters applied to the ground
state of hydrogen (l = m = 0, C00 = 2). The inte-
gral along the closed contour shown in Fig. 1 is zero
according to Cauchy’s theorem since we carefully avoid
to enclose the singularities marked by crosses. The inte-
grand is clearly invariant under the periodic translation
Re(t + T ) + iIm(t). Hence, the contri-
Re(t) + iIm(t)
butions to the integral from the vertical paths
P4
cancel exactly and, consequently, the contributions along
the horizontal paths must also cancel. We can therefore
equally well evaluate the integral Eq. (7) along the nega-
tive
P3 path. At the expense of introducing complex and
unphysical times, we see from Fig. 1 that we can calculate
the integral more eﬃciently in the complex t plane. It is
apparently much easier to evaluate the integral along the
P1. Along the former
path
path, the factor eiS(t) is nearly zero everywhere except
at the two saddle points while the same factor oscillates
P1. This fact is of course the basis

dle point method requires that we deformate the path to
pass across the saddle point in the direction of the steep-
est descent. In practice, the required deformation from
the horizontal line is small and has negligible inﬂuence
on the ﬁnal results.

In the saddle point method outlined in Ref. [5], one
neglects the variations of Q(t) over the range where the
factor [Q(t)2+κ2]−νeiS(t) has a signiﬁcant amplitude, i.e.,

The inclusion of nuclear motion in the molecular case
was discussed in detail for ionization [21] and for high
harmonic generation [22] within the SFA. The form of
the amplitude (7) stays the same and the formulas are
straightforwardly generalized. When it comes to the
assessment of the accuracy of the saddle-point method
which is the main objective of the present paper, nuclear
motion is unimportant and is left out for clarity.

III. RESULTS

A. Test case: atomic hydrogen

First we consider ionization of ground state hydrogen.
We use this system to benchmark the accuracy of the
saddle point method against numerical integration. The
atomic structure parameters are C00 = 2, κ = 1 and
ν = 1. Furthermore, the asymptotic form of Eq. (5) is
identical to the exact wave function at all distances and
the Fourier transform is

˜Φ0(q) =

16π
(1 + q2)2

1
√4π

.

(25)

The spherical harmonic and the hypergeomtric function
in Eq. (7) are both constant and it is therefore exact to
neglect variations therein around the saddle point when
we derive Eq. (10).

integration path in the neighborhood of the second sad-
dle point (see Fig 1). Additionally, we show the results
of the approximations using the one- and two-term ex-
pansion around the second saddle point in Eq. (13). We
see that the one-term expansion recovers quite well the
peak structure around the saddle point. In the wings of
the peak, the two-term expansion is signiﬁcantly better,
which is most evident from the real part of the integrand,
panel (a). We have integrated the integral numerically

Having seen that the saddle point method is accurate
in the single case above, namely ionization parallel to the
ﬁeld by 10 photons, we now present the n-photon angular
diﬀerential rates at varying photon orders in Fig. 3. Here
θq is the polar angle of the outgoing electron with respect
to the polarization axis. Figure 3 shows that both sad-
dle point methods predict an angular structure in close
agreement with the numerical integration. The rates ob-
tained by the single-term approximation are, however,
around 35% too small. The two-term approximation is
signiﬁcantly better with an accuracy within 10%.

In our ﬁnal test, we consider the total ionization rate
integrated over all angles of the outgoing electron.
In
Fig. 4 (a) we present total ionization rates at 800 nm ob-
tained with the numerical integration and the one- and
two-term saddle point approximation. All three methods
produce results in quite good agreement over many orders
of magnitude on the scale shown in the ﬁgure. In order
to investigate the accuracy of the saddle point method in
some more detail, we calculate the ratio Wsaddle/Wnum

and the numerical integration. Figures 4 (b) and (c)
present the results for various wavelengths and intensi-
ties. Again, we use both the one- and two-term approxi-
mation, i.e., we study the results of Eq. (18) with
I0µ and
Cµ), respectively. First, we see that the accura-
I0µ(1 +
cies of both saddle point methods are nearly independent
of the intensity for each ﬁxed value of the wavelength.
From panel (b) we note that the results of the one-term
approximation depend signiﬁcantly on the wavelength.
The error is up to a factor of two for the shortest wave-
length 248 nm while the error decreases with increasing
wavelength. The two-term approximation, on the other
hand, produces much more accurate results, panel (c).
The rates are approximately 10% too small for all in-
tensities and wavelengths considered. Even though the
simple single-term saddle point approximation is some-
what poorer than the two-term approximation the error
in the hydrogenic case is approximately constant over
twelve orders of magnitude and is not expected to be of
major signiﬁcance compared with the approximations in
the SFA itself. In the rest of the paper, we use only the
two-term saddle point formula.

Ionization of atoms

In this section we show results for the noble gas atoms
where the active electron initially occupies an orbital in
the ﬁlled p shell. We calculate the rates for each of the
states m =
1, 0, 1 and multiply the result by two corre-
sponding to two equivalent electrons in each orbital. We
take the atomic structure parameters Clm and Eb from
Ref. [21].

In Fig. 5 we present the absolute and relative rates for
the argon atom. As in the case of hydrogen, the saddle
point method is accurate over many orders of magni-
tude, Fig. 5 (a). Interestingly, the saddle point method
is slightly better for the m = 1 [panel (c)] state compared
with the m = 0 state [panel (b)]. This m-dependent ac-
curacy turns out to be important in the molecular case
as we show in Sec. III C below.

Figure 6 shows angular diﬀerential rates summed over
all photon absorptions at a wavelength of 800 nm for dif-
ferent intensities. We show the results for both the m = 0
and m = 1 state and again we see that the saddle point
method works better for the m = 1 state. The general
features in the angular spectra are, however, very well
reproduced in all cases.

We mention in closing that the results for krypton and
xenon are very similar to argon and are therefore omitted
here for brevity.

Ionization of molecules

In the molecular case, the calculations are most conve-
niently performed in the laboratory ﬁxed frame with the
z axis parallel to the laser polarization. Accordingly, we
must express the initial wave function in this frame. The
wave function and asymptotic expansion coeﬃcients Clm
are, however, most naturally expressed in the body-ﬁxed
molecular frame. If the body-ﬁxed frame is rotated by the
Euler angles (α, β, γ) with respect to the laser polariza-
tion, we rotate the wave function into the laboratory ﬁxed
frame by the rotation operator Φ0(r)
D(α, β, γ)Φ0(r).
The rotation operation eﬀectively allows us to express
the asymptotic coeﬃcients in the laboratory frame (LF)
by the corresponding coeﬃcients in the molecular frame

axes. We refer to Ref. [21] for the coeﬃcients CMF

Figure 7 presents angular diﬀerential rates for diﬀer-
ently aligned N2 molecules which ionize from the dou-
bly occupied 3σg orbital. We show both numerical [(a)-
(c)] and two-term saddle point results [(d)-(f)]. First we
note that the two methods agree perfectly on the shape
of the angular distribution for all alignment angles, β.
The structures are also in good agreement with Ref. [25],
where we used an atomic centred Gaussian basis expan-
sion for the initial state and calculated the transition
amplitude numerically. Secondly, the overall structure is
nearly independent of β. The angular rate is simply much
favoured along the polarization direction in all geome-
tries. This observation agrees well with the predictions
of tunneling theory where the electron by assumption es-
capes along the polarization axis (For Keldysh parame-
1, the ionization dynamics is tunneling
ter γ = κω/F0 ≪
like. In Fig. 7, γ = 0.81, i.e., approaching the tunneling
regime.)

Figure 8 shows the angular diﬀerential rate for O2
which ionizes from the two half-ﬁlled degenerate πg or-
1. We show
bitals, one with m = 1 and one with m =
the results for a single electron with projection m = 1 and
note that the rate is similar for m =
1. Again we see
that the two methods predict the exact same complex an-
gular structures. The structures can be understood from
the symmetry of the initial wave function. The initial πg
orbital has zero amplitude along- and in the plane per-
pendicular to the molecular axis and the nodal structure
of the wave function forbids the electron to be emitted
along the vertical polarization axis when this axis coin-
cides with a nodal plane [3].

In Figs. 7 and 8 we see that even though the angular
structures agree perfectly, the absolute scales diﬀer by up

axis (β = 0) and minimized when aligned perpendicu-
larly (β = 90◦). Such an alignment dependence is also
seen experimentally [26]. For O2 both methods also agree
that the rate is maximized around an alignment angle of
40◦. For both molecules, however, the two-term saddle
point method predicts a too large variation compared
with the numerical integration. The reason for this dis-
agreement lies in the m-dependent accuracy of the saddle
point method as we discussed in Sec. III B. When we ro-
tate a molecule we change the expansion of the initial
wave function in the laboratory ﬁxed spherical harmon-
ics. The rotation operation mixes the diﬀerent m-states
according to Eq. (27). Since the part of the transition
amplitude that corresponds to each of the m-states can
be either slightly too large or too small by the saddle
point method, the overall accuracy depends on the partial
wave decomposition after the rotation. For the atomic
l = 1 and m = 0,
1 states of Sec III B, the two-term
saddle point method is still quite accurate and the small
diﬀerences reported there compared with the numerical
integration cannot account for the disagreement between
the two methods in Fig. 9. For the molecules, however,
we have included angular momentum states up to l = 4
and it turns out that the saddle point method becomes
increasingly inaccurate with increasing l.
If the active
electron initially occupies an orbital with a component of
non-zero angular momentum, we expect the saddle point
method to be somewhat poorer than for l = 0 as we dis-
cussed in deriving Eq. (10). In Eq. (10), we evaluate the
factors Q(t)lYlm[ ˆQ(t)] and the hypergeomtric function at
the saddle points. This approximation is naturally most
accurate if Q(t) is nearly constant in the vicinity of the
saddle points. In appendix A, we calculate Q(t) along the
integration contour and we see from Fig. 10 that the vari-
ation in Im[Q(t)] is in fact close to maximal at the saddle
points. If we require higher accuracy of the saddle point
method, we must take at least the ﬁrst order variation in
Q(t) into account and modify Eq. (10) accordingly.

sion of the alignment dependent rate. We calculate the
total rate integrated over all angles of the outgoing elec-
tron and show the results in Fig. 9. The ﬁgure shows that
both methods agree that the rate for N2 is maximized

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

(a)

(b)

Based on the length gauge SFA, we proposed a two-
term saddle point formula which is applicable to neutral
atoms and molecules. We presented calculations on var-
ious atoms and molecules with the primary aim to test
the accuracy of the method. The two-term saddle-point
evaluation is very accurate in the case of ionization of hy-
drogen while the accuracy is within
10% for noble gas
atoms which undergo ionization from a p shell. Remark-
ably, the structures of the angular photo electron spec-
trum predicted for all systems are in perfect agreement
with numerical calculations. We have identiﬁed that the
saddle point method in our formulation works best if the
initial wave function is a zero angular momentum state.
Multicentric molecular wave functions contain many dif-
ferent angular momenta and correspondingly we see small
inaccuracies when we use the saddle point method for
molecules.

≈

In contrast to previous reports on saddle point meth-
ods in the velocity gauge SFA [16], we did not ﬁnd a criti-
cal lowest intensity below which the saddle point method
fails. Even though we ﬁnd small errors which are direct
consequences of using the saddle point method instead of
a numerical evaluation of the transition amplitude, the
error is nearly constant for a wide range of intensities and
is small compared to the large variations in the absolute
rates. Furthermore, we should keep in mind that the SFA
itself is only the leading order of an S -matrix series. The
small error in the saddle point evaluation may therefore
turn out to be insigniﬁcant compared to, e.g., neglecting
the Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal state [27].

We conclude that the saddle point method in the
present two-term version can be used with advantage for
long wavelengths and high intensities when many photon
absorptions lead to ionization. In this case, the transi-
tion amplitude is diﬃcult to evaluate numerically since
the integrand oscillates rapidly. The SFA also applies to
non-monochromatic ﬁelds, e.g., a few cycle pulse. The
transition amplitude is then calculated by an integral
over the full duration of the pulse. Numerical integration
by standard Gaussian quadrature requires thousands of
function evaluations to obtain convergence [28]. It would
clearly be desirable to extend the saddle point method to
such a situation where we need just a few saddle point
evaluations.

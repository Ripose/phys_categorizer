Abstract. We study the ionization process involving antiproton (¯p) and hydrogen
in the energy range between 0.1 keV to 500 keV, using single center close coupling
approximation. We construct the scattering wave function using B-spline bases. The
results obtained for ionization of atomic hydrogen are compared with other existing
theoretical calculations as well as with the available experimental data. The present
results are found to be encouraging. We also employed this method to study the
ionization of He+ in the energy range between 1 and 500 keV. On comparision, the
present results are found to interpret well the cross section values calculated using
other theories.

ionization of atomic hydrogen and He+ by slow antiproton

1. Introduction

The recent experimental research using slow antiprotons (¯p) has been in progress. In
near future it will measure the cross sections in the low energy region and will provide a
strong challange to theory in order to predict accurate cross sections in the energy range
the experiment is concerned. The collisions of ¯p with atomic hydrogen can be considered
as a fundamental process and is relevent in many applied areas of physics. For proton
impact, the ﬁnal state can be a superposition of elastic scattering, excitation, ionization
and charge exchange. However, for antiproton impact the charge transfer channel is

in the case of slow ¯p projectile.
In low energy heavy particle collision it is not easy
to single out the dominant channel, because many inelastic channels strongly couple
with one another open up, exchanging ﬂux and phase in complicated manner. Thus
without inclusion of important channels, an accurate determination of cross sections is
not possible. In case of ionization it is particularly important to describe the continuum
part of the wave function with utmost care in order to achieve accurate results.

Recently, there have been a large number of studies for ¯p- H system using various
theoretical approachs. However, most of the close coupling calculations are concentreted
on single center expansion method. It has been realized that accurate cross sections
can be calculated if a single-centred basis includes states with high angular momenta.
Because states associated with high angular momenta are capable of describing the two
center nature of the collision processes and is particularly suitable for ¯p scattering (Hall
et al 1994, 1996, Wherman et al 1996). However, it has been reported by Toshima (2001)
that below 1 keV the one center pseudostate expansion method underestimates the cross
sections due to inability to represent the expanding distribution of ionized electrons. For
¯p projectile, most of the calulations performed are single center close coupling methods,
based on semiclassical impact parameter treatment where the scattering wavefunctions
are expanded around the target nucleus using suitable bases (Schiwietz 1990, Hall
et al 1996, Igarashi et al 2000, Azuma et al 2002). Pons (1996) proposed a new
momocentric close coupling expansion in terms of spherical Bessel functions conﬁned
in a ﬁnite box in the study of ¯p - H ionization. Other methods include direct solution
of Schrodinger equation: Wells et al (1996) solved the Schrodinger equation directly
on three dimensional lattice without using expansion of basis set. Similarly Tong et al
(2001) solved the Schrodinger equation taking a semiclassical approximation for nuclear
motion and the time evolution of electron wave function is propagated by split-operator
method with generalized pseudospectral method in the energy representation. Sakimoto
(2000) solved the time dependent Schrodinger equation directly using a discrete variable
representation technique. For radial coordinates, he constructed the numerical mesh
from generalized laguerre quadrature points.

In this article we make use of B-spline bases for the construction of scattering wave
function. B-spline has been widely used in atomic physics (Martrin 1999) particularly
due to its ability to describe the continuum channels more accurately in comparision to

ionization of atomic hydrogen and He+ by slow antiproton

other conventional methods (Azuma et al 2002). We give particular interest to study
the ionization of He+ under ¯p impact. For the collision of ¯p with hydrogenic ions such
as He+,a number of calculations have been performed. Schultz et al (1996a) used four
diﬀerent methods to calculate the cross sections: very large scale numerical solution of
time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE), hidden crossing theory (HC), classical
trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC), and continuum distorted eikonal initial state (CDE-
EIS). TDSE calculations which are assumed to be the most accurate in the low energy
region are found closer to HC results at low energies. This calculation also follows CTMC
results at intermediate energies and CDW-EIS results at high energies. However, the
TDSE cross sections are found to be about four times larger than those calculated by
Janev et al (1995). A discussion about this disagreements can be seen in the article by
Krstic et al (1996). Wherman et al (1996) used a large single centred Hibert basis sets
to study the ionization of He+ by antiproton impact. They found that their results are
in good agreement with TDSE results, diﬀereing by 6-13 % and the results obtained by
Janev et al (1995) were smaller by a factor of four. Kirchner et al (1999) used basis
generator method (BGM) for ¯p - He+ ionization. In case of ¯p - H system, there is good
convergency of results among various theoretical approaches. However, the experimental
data in the low energy range is awiated. For the case of ¯p - He+ ionization there is no
experimental data available and it is necessary to investigate this system in detail using
diﬀerent approachs and compare the results with other theories. We study the ionization
process of hydrogenic ions under slow ¯p projectile impact using single center expansion
of scattering wave function in terms of B-spline basis sets. The detailed description of
present theory is presented in section II. Atomic units (a.u.) are are used throughout
unless otherwise stated.

2. Theory

We use impact parameter approximation where the internuclear motion is treated
classically as R = b + vt, with b the impact parameter, v the impact velocity and t the
time and the electronic motion is subjected to quantum mechanical laws. The electronic
motion can be described by the solution of time dependent Schrodinger equation

where r is the position vector of the electron with respect to proton. The atomic
Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

where ZT is the nuclear charge of the target and Vint is the time depenent interaction
between the projectile and target electron. The interaction between ¯p - hydrogenic ions
is given by

3. Results and Discussions

We solved the Schrodinger equation for ¯p colliding with hydrogen and hydrogenic ions.
Calculations are performed with 45 radial functions obtained from 8th order B-splines
deﬁned in the interval 0 to rmax=200 a.u. The maximum orbital angular momentum
lmax used in the calculation is 8. Since a single centred expansion calculation requires
the retaintion of much higher values of angular momentum for producing well converged
results. By taking all the degeneracies for magnetic quantum number m, we solved the
coupled diﬀerential equation (10) with 2025(m
0) number of basis sets. We integrated
equation (10) in the interval vt =
30 a.u. to vt = 50 a.u.. we considered the motion
of the projectile along z axis and x-z is the collision plane.

that these authors also performed a calculation using curved trajectory which is not
presented here. The results of one center Hilbert space calculation Hall et al are found
to be a little higher than the present calculated values in the energy range between
20-100 kev impact energies. However, the once center calculation of Igarshi et al which
uses Sturmian basis is found to be in resonably good agreement with the present values.
The results of Sakimoto (2000) who used Laguerre meshes and the TDSE results of
Wells et al are a little higher than our calculated values. Wells et al used a numeriucal
solution of three dimensional Cartesian co-ordinate grids. The results of direct solution
is always larger than the other calculated values. They mentioned that consideration
of only n
3 bound channels is insuﬃcient and the estimated cross sections would
overestimate. The calculation of Pons which makes use of the spherical Bessel functions
to describe continuum channels are consistent with the present calculation. The recent
calculation of Azuma et al who used the B-spline bases similar to the present one is
found be in better agreement except around 0.1 keV impact energies. At this incident
energy the present value slightly overestimates the calculation of Azuma et al .

In ﬁgure 2 we compare the present calculated results with available experimental
measurements of Knudsen et al (1995). There is a good agreement between the present
results and the experimental data over the whole energy range considered.

It clear from Figs. 1 that all the results for total ionization calculated using diﬀerent
approaches show reseonably good agreement in both qualitative and quantitative
measures. All the theoretical values including the present one (Fig. 2) are in good
agreement with the experiment of Knudsen et al . It will be interesting if the experiment
measures the cross section data down to 1 keV energy range. We hope these will be
available soon. In ﬁgure 3 we plotted bP (b) as a function of impact parameter b for

impact energy shows long tail and it dissapears as the collision energy decreases. The
paek values also shifts to the lower impact parameter as the collision energy decreases.

Schrodinger-equation approach (LTDSE) (Schultz et al 1997) and Single center results
(Ford et al (private communication), Wherman et al (1996) and references therein).
Also included in the ﬁgure are the results of Kirchner et al who used Basis Generator
Method (BGM). This method deals with the construction of a basis that dynamically
adapts to the collision process considered in order to follow the propagation and to cover
the one dimensional subspace deﬁned by the solution of the time dependent Schrodinger
equation(TDSE). It may be seen in the ﬁgure that the present results are found to be
in good agreement with the calculation of Ford et al who employed a single centred
Hilbert basis set. However, both LTDSE and BGM results slightly overestimate the
present cross sections. It has been mentioned in the paper of Schultz et al that this
overestimation in comparision to the results of Ford et al is about 10%. They reported
that this may due to the fact that it is likely that the excitation of He+ to higher n

They ﬁnally concluded that the treatment of excitation to n
4 would be important
in their method. Additionally other factors such as grid spacing would also needs to
be carefully examined in order to calculate the ionization result beyond an accuracy of
10%.

Figure 5. Ionization probabilities in ¯p - He+(1s) collisions as a function of impact
parameter b at various incident energies

To support the present calculation, we displayed in Fig. 5 the variation of ionization
probability with the impact parameter for various collision energies. It may be noted
that b P (b) as function of b shows long tail for higher impact energies which is well
experienced in case of 500 keV impact energies. However, for all collision energies peaks
around b = 0.3 a.u. are observed. We also derived the dynamic ionization probability
at this impact parameter (0.3 a.u.) when the two nuclei are separated from each other
at some distance.

This is shown in Fig. 6. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the ionization probabilities
saturate around z(vt) = 10 a.u. for all impact energies except 500 keV where the
saturation starts early around z(vt) = 3a.u.. The probability shows a rapid growth

between -3 and 3 a.u. and then saturatation starts. Therefore we allowed suﬃcient time
for the probability to become completely stable. The same type of situation has been
shown by Tong et al (2001) who used curved trajectory for ¯p - H ionization. They have
reported that for high collision energies (above 1 keV) the probability saturates z(vt)
above 10 a.u. with a rapid increase from Z(vt) = -5 a.u.. For collision velocities (below
1 keV), they found a slow increase of the probability. This time delay can be termed
as post-collisional interaction. Pons (2000) indicated that that due to slow antiproton
motion the projectile pushes away the ejected electron even when the prjectile is going
farther from the target. Afterall in the present case Fig. 5 helps for a convergence check.
It may be worth to mention that in the case of ¯p - H ionization, where in the limit of
small internuclear distance, the electron experiences a dipole like potential bound by two
nuclei (Krstic et al 1996) and there exists a critical value of the dipole stength below
It corresponds to the internuclear distance
which no bound state can be supported.
known as Fermi-Teller radius (Fermi and Teller 1947) at which the eigen energies of the

ground state merge with the continuum. However, in case of an asymmetric dipole as in
¯p - He+ case, Krstic et al reported that the electronic eigen states donot merge with the
continuum and hence the ionization cross sections are expected to show an exponential
decrease for small collision velocities. These situations are clearly evient in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2.

4. Conclusions

The results obtained for ¯p - H are found to be in good agreement with the other
calculated values as well as the available experimental data. However, the experimental
results are still awaited in low energy range. For the case of He+ target, all the
theoretical calculations includding the present one show good agreement within a few
percent of accuracy. Speciﬁcally the present results and the results of Ford show a
good convergency. Our B-spline basis results conﬁrms the single center Hilbert space
calculation of Ford. There is no measured values for this system. It would be interesting
to have more calculations for slow ¯p projctile collisiding with He+.

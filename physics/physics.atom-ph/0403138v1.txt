We present a simple method to include the eﬀects of diﬀraction into the description of a light-
atomic ensemble quantum interface in the context of collective variables. Carrying out a scattering
calculation we single out the purely geometrical eﬀect and apply our method to the experimental
relevant case of Gaussian shaped atomic samples stored in single beam optical dipole traps probed
by a Gaussian beam. We derive simple scaling relations for the eﬀect of the interaction geometry
and compare our ﬁndings to the results from one dimensional models of light propagation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Coupling collective variables of atomic ensembles to
propagating modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has been
identiﬁed as an eﬃcient tool to engineer the states of
atoms and light at the quantum level. Several proposals
for spin-squeezing, mapping of quantum states between
light and atoms, i.e. quantum memory operations, cre-
ation of macroscopic entanglement, and teleportation of
atomic states have been published [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
A number of these proposals have actually been veriﬁed
experimentally using atomic samples stored in vapor cells
as well as in magneto optical traps [9, 10, 11, 12]. The
eﬃciency of the coupling is often discussed resorting to
eﬀective 1-D models for the light propagating through
a homogeneous sample and the optical depth is found
to be the essential parameter determining the coupling
strength. This naturally suggests the use of cold and
trapped atomic samples, where long coherence times for
collective variables are possible, with a shape mimicking
a 1-D string of atoms to maximize column density for
a given number of atoms. However, while the eﬀective
1-D models work well for wide and nearly homogeneous
samples the question of light diﬀraction from small, in-
herently inhomogeneous samples and its impact on cou-
pling eﬃciency immediately arises when cold and trapped
atomic samples are used [13]. In a recent work [14] as-
pects of spatial inhomogeneity have been addressed via
the introduction of new asymmetric collective variables.

The purpose of the present paper is twofold. We
present a simple and eﬀective semi-analytic method to
identify the spatial light mode the atomic sample cou-
ples to and use this method to ﬁnd optimum shapes for
atomic samples. In addition we will derive simple scal-
ing parameters describing the eﬀect of the shape of the
atomic sample which allow us to make a link to the estab-
lished 1-D models and quantify the eﬀect of diﬀraction

on the coupling strength. Albeit we are ultimately in-
terested in measuring and manipulating quantum states,
we ﬁnd it instructive to solve the underlying classical
scattering problem ﬁrst to single out the purely geomet-
ric eﬀects, and we try to avoid hiding useful practical
information behind the much more intricate mathemati-
cal formalism needed to solve the full quantum problem.
Our approach delivers valuable information for designing
experimental conﬁgurations, provides intuitive pictures,
and may serve as a starting point for a more elaborate
quantum theoretical treatment.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we review brieﬂy the quantum description of
two modes of light coupled coherently to atoms in terms
of collective variables and introduce typical experimen-
tal conﬁgurations. Using this framework we motivate the
use of the coherently scattered power by the atomic sam-
ple as the relevant parameter to optimize for the quan-
tum coupling. Section 3 presents our model for calculat-
ing the scattering mode and the scattering eﬃciency of
the atomic sample for diﬀerent geometries together with
some remarks on the assumptions made and the range of
validity of the model. In Section 4 we apply this model to
atoms stored in a single beam optical dipole trap. In Sec-
tion 5 we provide a link between our classical calculation
and the results from eﬀective 1-D models. Section 6 sum-
marizes our results and points out possible extensions of
our model.

II. COLLECTIVE LIGHT-ATOM COUPLING

The hermitian part of the interaction of a two-mode
pulse of oﬀ-resonant light with an ensemble of atoms
with two ground states residing in a container with cross-
sectional area A and length L can be described by a
Hamiltonian of the form (see e.g.[7, 15, 16, 17]):

The factor in front of the integral describing the strength
of the coupling of the collective variables contains the

single-atom reactive response to radiation characterized
by the cross-section σ0, the detuning ∆ in units of the
natural linewidth Γ, and the cross-sectional area of the
light mode governing the electric ﬁeld strength per pho-
ton occupying the mode. In eq.(1) collective operators
for light ˆS and atoms ˆJ are introduced. For light we
can write ˆS in terms of continuous mode creation and
annihilation operators with boson commutation rules:
ˆSx = 1
1 ˆa2), ˆSz =
1 ˆa2), ˆSy = 1

2 ˆa2 −
1 ˆa1). For simplicity of notation the time and
spatial dependence of the operators has been suppressed.
The mode index can specify for instance two ﬁelds prop-
agating in the two legs of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
(Fig.1a) or left and right circular polarized modes of a
single laser beam (Fig.1b), in which case the operator
expressions describe the instantaneous Stokes vector of
the light [18]. By construction the collective operators
follow the usual commutator algebra for vector opera-
tors. For atoms, restricting us for simplicity to the case
of two ground-states only, we deﬁne in analogy: ˆJx =

extends over the number of atoms Nat(z) residing in a
thin slice of the interaction volume at position z [19]. A
continuum limit is taken by shrinking the thickness δz of
the slices to zero. The three operators ˆJi are the macro-
scopic Bloch-vector components for the 2-level system
formed by the two ground states. Inherent in this descrip-
tion are the assumptions that the transverse mode func-
tion is a frozen variable, hence the 1-D integration over
the Hamilton density in eq.(1), and that the atoms scat-
ter light coherently only into the input modes. This is a
good approximation for atomic ensembles and light ﬁelds
transversally much wider than an optical wavelength and
not too long samples. In addition, since the operator na-
ture of atomic position is suppressed, the spatial density
distribution of the atoms is not changed by the interac-
tion with the radiation in this model.

The dynamics generated by eq.(1) at the level of ex-
pectation values describes diﬀerential phase shifts of the
light modes due to coherent forward scattering by the
atoms in the two ground states and diﬀerential shifts of
the atomic energy levels due to the intensity diﬀerence
of the two light modes. This dynamics can be conve-
niently visualized with the help of coupled Bloch spheres
for light and atom variables. Of particular interest for
practical quantum state engineering is the case of initial
conditions with ˆJ in
x large and classical, i.e. un-
correlated coherent states with expectation values on the
order of half the total number of atoms and photons re-
spectively.
In this case the dynamical evolution of the
system is driven entirely by the ﬂuctuations of light and
atomic variables. In the experimental setup sketched in
Fig.1b this corresponds to linearly polarized input light
and all atoms in a balanced coherent superposition of the
two ground states, such that there is a macroscopic mag-
netic polarization in the plane orthogonal to the direction

x and ˆSin

of propagation. Linearizing the spectrum of the opera-
tors around their expectation values and integrating the
dynamics, to leading order, input/output relations can
be written for the ﬂuctuations of the collective operators
orthogonal to the coherent excitation [20, 21]:

Here the ﬁrst term reﬂects the noise of the coherent in-
put state of light, with nph the total number of probe
photons, while the second term describes the excess ﬂuc-
tuations imprinted onto the light by the ﬂuctuations of
the atomic variable and ampliﬁed by the large coherent
amplitude of the conjugate light variable. From the mea-
surement record we can infer a value for the atomic vari-
able with a conﬁdence interval limited by the ﬁrst term,
i.e. with a signal to noise ratio of:

Projection of the atomic state by the destructive mea-
surement on light, will leave the collective atomic variable
in a state with ﬂuctuations reduced below the standard
quantum limit if the signal to noise ratio is ﬁnite.
In
practical terms this means that repeated measurements
on the same atomic system will show a covariance below
the projection noise [22]. To the extent the measurement
is nondestructive, i.e. after proper inclusion of sponta-
neous emission [23], this fact can be exploited to write,
store, and retrieve quantum information to and from the
atomic variable. Instead of measuring destructively the
light pulse after a single pass through the atomic ensem-
ble one can allow for multiple interaction together with
appropriate switching of the coupling Hamiltonian be-
tween consecutive passes. This way unconditional quan-
tum state preparation is possible and the measurement
serves merely as a veriﬁcation of successful state prepa-
ration [8, 23, 24]. In this more general setting the above
deﬁned signal to noise ratio plays the role of a coupling
strength κ2:

The interaction

Here Eprobe(Eref ) denotes the initial ﬁeld in the probe
(reference) arm. The integrals over the detector area
describe the overlap of the transverse mode functions
Msc, Mprobe, Mref in the detector plane and contain also
the oscillatory dependence on the path length diﬀerence
of the interferometer. We separate explicitly the ﬁeld
scattered by the atoms Esc from the probe ﬁeld Eprobe,
since in general it will not be in the same spatial mode
and have a diﬀerent phase. We can adjust the path length
diﬀerence such to make the second integral in eq.(4) van-
ˆSxi
ish - this corresponds to the preparation of a large

ˆSyi
and a measurement of
with the detector in the lan-

guage of the quantum description. We note that for dis-
persive scattering in the far ﬁeld, probe wave and scat-
tered wave are nearly π/2 out of phase, so the ﬁrst term
in eq.(4) will take its maximum value whenever the sec-
ond term vanishes. The detector signal stems then from
the interference of the reference wave with the scattered
wave only. The atomic contribution and consequently
the sensitivity of the measurement will thus be a mono-
tonic function of both the coherently scattered power by
the atoms and of the geometric overlap of the wavefronts
of scattered wave and reference wave. Carrying out the
overlap integral assuming perfect matching of the refer-
ence wave to the scattered wave, we write for the detector
signal power S2:

After this brief review of the 1-D quantum model, we
look again at the experimental conﬁguration in Fig.1a
[25], seeking this time a description in purely classical
terms and pointing out where we go beyond the 1-D
model. A cloud of cold atoms residing in one arm of
the interferometer is loaded into a far-oﬀ-resonant dipole
trap created by a focused gaussian beam. Probe light
with a wave-vector k = 2π/λ enters the interferometer
from the left and passes through the atomic sample. The
light experiences a phase shift caused by the refractive
index of the sample, which is determined by the atomic
density and the distribution of population among the two
diﬀerent sub-levels. Given an atomic density distribution
the light carries thus information about the level popu-
lations after passage through the sample.
In turn, the
atomic energy levels are shifted diﬀerentially during the
interaction and thus information about the light is de-
posited in the coherence between the atomic levels. To
assess the sensitivity of a measurement of the atomic pop-
ulation diﬀerence we look at the signal by the balanced
homodyne detector (with quantum eﬃciency ε) on the
right upon detection of a pulse of light (frequency ω) of
duration τ . The detector signal SD, i.e. the photocurrent
is in units of the elementary charge e integrated over the

noise power N 2 as:

N 2 =

2Pref

ετ
~ω

Since we want to assess the sensitivity with reference to
the ﬂuctuations of the population diﬀerence in an uncor-
related atomic sample we have to normalize our signal
power to this variance, i.e. to a half of the total number
of atoms. With this we arrive at an equivalent expression
for the signal to noise ratio (SNR) or coupling strength
as:

Here the coupling strength is expressed in terms of
the - admittedly artiﬁcial quantity (see section V) - total
scattered power per atom. We conclude that optimizing
the sensitivity is equivalent to maximizing the scatter-
ing eﬃciency and adapting the reference wavefront to
the scattered wave. Trivially the scattered power can be
increased by increasing the input power to the interfer-
ometer. But here upper limits are set by saturation of the
detectors and the requirement for low spontaneous emis-
sion rate. We choose therefore to perform the search for
optimal shapes of the atomic samples and of the probe
beam in the next section under conditions of constant
probe power. Given a maximum pulse energy the detec-
tors can withstand, the integrated spontaneous emission
rate can be set to a desired value by choosing the single
atom scattering cross section via the detuning.
In the
next section we calculate the scattering eﬃciency and
the scattered wavefront for selected geometries.

III. SCATTERING MODEL

In order to calculate the stationary diﬀracted ﬁeld by
the atomic density distribution we model the sample as
an ensemble of ﬁxed (i.e.
inﬁnitely heavy) point scat-
terers and make use of a Born approximation [27, 28].
Assuming ﬁxed positions we neglect Doppler and recoil
shifts. Since we expect coherent diﬀraction to occur
mainly close to the forward direction and we are inter-
ested in samples at ultralow temperatures, Doppler shifts
will play a negligible role. On time scales short compared
to the recoil time - the time needed for an atom to travel
a distance of an optical wavelength at one recoil veloc-
ity - we can assume that spatial correlations are frozen,
i.e. neglect of the recoil to the atom during scattering
In the ﬁrst Born approximation we ne-
is valid [29].
glect multiple scattering events and calculate the total
scattered ﬁeld as the sum of the ﬁelds scattered by in-
dependent single scatterers out of the probe ﬁeld. This
approach is justiﬁed as long as the contribution from all
other scatterers to the local ﬁeld seen by an individual
scatterer is small compared to the probe ﬁeld which de-
mands e.g. negligible absorption. This condition is also
helped by destructive interference of scattered waves for

4

the case of balanced sub-level populations in the experi-
mental conﬁguration introduced in the previous section.
The condition of independent scatterers can only be met
for not too high atomic density (nat < k3) otherwise
resonant dipole-dipole interaction can change the single
atom scattering properties appreciably.

A. Scattering integral

As the ﬁrst ingredient we need the scattering ampli-
tude f for a single atom. In our calculations we replace
the p-wave scattering amplitude by an isotropic ampli-
tude f equal in magnitude to the true forward scattering
amplitude. This assumption greatly simpliﬁes analytic
calculations and will be justiﬁed a posteriori by the ob-
servation that constructive interference occurs only close
2 over the solid
to the forward direction. Integrating
|
angle renders the scattering cross-section at a given de-
tuning ∆ of the probe laser from the atomic resonance
[30]. For the experimentally relevant case of alkali atoms
our choice for the scattering cross section is valid for any
sub-level of the ground state probed by linearly polarized
light provided the detuning ∆ is large compared to the
excited state hyperﬁne splitting:

We remark here that this classical treatment includes the
full response of the atom to the incident ﬁeld, i.e. also
the coupling to all empty modes of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. There is no distinction between spontaneous and
induced emission and the only assumption made is that
the response of the atom is linear in the incident ﬁeld,
i.e.
the atomic transition is not saturated. Naturally,
since we treat the ﬁeld as a classical variable, the sta-
tistical properties of the ﬁeld, e.g. also the frequency
spectrum of detected scattered light, are not described
correctly. However, in the experimentally relevant case
of large detuning and low intensity scattering is almost
entirely elastic [31] and in the ﬁrst Born approximation
these shortcomings do not enter the problem, since ex-
change of photons between the atoms, i.e. multiple scat-
tering, is neglected.

The total scattered wave is the sum of the waves scat-
tered by individual scatterers j (j = 1..Nat) and can be
expressed in terms of electromagnetic ﬁeld vector in com-
plex notation as [Fig.2]:

Since we want to describe free diﬀraction of probe light
and scattered light on an equal footing, we choose the in-
cident probe beam not as a plane wave but rather as gaus-
sian with parameters w(z), R(z), Φ(z) being the beam ra-
dius, wavefront radius and Guoy phase, respectively:

As a realistic model for the density distribution of the
trapped sample we choose a Gaussian function. This cor-
responds to the equilibrium shape of a thermal distribu-
tion of atoms residing inside a harmonic oscillator poten-
tial. For low enough temperature with respect to the trap
depth this is a good description for a dipole trapped sam-
ple. In particular, for the transverse dimensions, where
we carry out the the integration of the scattering integral
analytically, this choice simpliﬁes the mathematics. We
note in passing that a generalization to arbitrary trans-
verse distributions by expansion into Hermite polynomi-
als is possible though analytically cumbersome.

The atomic density distribution in the transverse di-
rection has a radius wa, which depends on z due to the
weaker conﬁnement by the dipole trap laser beam (wave-
length λdip) away from its minimal beam waist. In the
longitudinal direction (along the propagation axis of the
probe beam) it is described by a 1/e-length parameter

In the following we use a continuous density distribu-

ﬁnd a particle in a small volume element, again suitably
normalized to the total number of particles. This aver-
aging procedure eliminates large angle scattering oﬀ the
microscopic density ﬂuctuations, which is equivalent to
the single particle Rayleigh scattering background for a
discrete distribution of scatterers, i.e. spontaneous emis-
sion at low saturation parameter [27]. Equally Bragg
scattering of light from a regular distribution of atoms
on the wavelength scale is lost by the coarse graining.

Here the integration over z is to be taken only over the
length eﬀectively occupied by the sample, but cannot be
extended beyond the observation plane. We evaluate the
scattered ﬁeld distribution in some distant observation
plane (M ′ in Fig.2) by carrying out the integration over
the transverse coordinates of the sample analytically and
integrating numerically over the length of the sample.
Using standard software on a desktop PC a scattered
ﬁeld proﬁle can be calculated in several seconds allowing
for fast interactive optimization of parameters. Not sur-
prisingly for our model assumptions and the choice of the
density distribution, we ﬁnd the scattered mode proﬁle

to be very close to Gaussian in all of the studied cases
and we can extract parameters like width and radius of
curvature by ﬁtting to the corresponding mode proﬁle.
The scattering eﬃciency is evaluated by calculating the
total scattered power in the observation plane.

B. Qualitative considerations

Before presenting results of the numerical calculations
some qualitative considerations are at hand to train our
intuition for the results to be expected. First, the total
scattered power is strictly proportional to the square of
the number of atoms for a ﬁxed geometry of the sam-
ple. This is a simple consequence of our continuum ap-
proximation for the density distribution and may at ﬁrst
sight seem disturbing, but is of course natural for co-
herent scattering, where constructive interference of sin-
gle scattering amplitudes occurs in phase-matched direc-
tions. Secondly, far enough away from the sample all
scattered waves will interfere constructively in the strict
forward direction, so the on-axis scattered intensity for
a wide probe beam will be independent of the exact ge-
ometry of the sample. This implies that scattering eﬃ-
ciency is determined eﬀectively by the opening angle of
the scattering cone around the forward direction. Simple
scaling arguments can be derived for this opening angle
by looking at Fraunhofer diﬀraction from transversally
and longitudinally extended samples.

Let us ﬁrst look at the diﬀraction cone of a short homo-
geneous sample of width 2wa (Fig.3). To ﬁnd the angle
where interference of scattered waves ceases to be con-
structive we divide the sample in two halves. For a path
length diﬀerence of half a wavelength between the ends of
a half, destructive interference will occur, giving a limit
to the opening angle of the scattering cone. In analogy
to the far ﬁeld diﬀraction angle of a Gaussian beam we
ﬁnd for a Gaussian source distribution an opening angle
νtr of:

νtr ≈

tan νtr =

Narrow samples scatter thus more eﬃciently than wide
samples and integrating the angular distribution of scat-
tered intensity predicts a 1/w2

at which the longitudinal extent of the cloud causes de-

into account the gaussian apodization we can estimate

For atomic samples of length L0 comparable or longer
than zra, scattered waves from diﬀerent sections along
the propagation direction will be mismatched in phase
and the total scattering cross section will be signiﬁcantly
reduced with respect to a short sample with the same
number of atoms.

We can construct an approximate expression for the
total scattered power combining the above arguments in
order to cast the inﬂuence of the experimental param-
eters sample width, sample length and beam diameter
into a compact formula. Neglecting for a moment the
change of transverse spread over the length of the sam-
ple, the scattered intensity on the optical axis far away
from the sample where all atoms are phase matched is

care of the very close to Gaussian proﬁle of the scattered
wave. We expect this to be an excellent approximation
whenever the scattering cone is narrow. In order to model
the tradeoﬀ between transversal and longitudinal limita-
tion we have to design a function which takes the value of
the smaller of the two angles whenever they are grossly
diﬀerent. We take:

Here the transverse limit angle takes into account diﬀrac-

probe beam width. There is a great deal of freedom in
the choice of θef f and diﬀerent deﬁnitions will lead to
diﬀerent functional dependencies of the scattering eﬃ-
ciency on the length of the sample. Our speciﬁc choice
for θef f is motivated by the crossover we observe in our
numerical calculations for wide probe beams presented
below. Inserting the above formula we arrive after some
straightforward algebra at a compact expression for the
scattered power as:

C. Numerical solutions of the diﬀraction integral

Armed with the intuitive arguments and eq.(14) for the
scattering eﬃciency we can now proceed to present some

of our numerical results. We choose parameters for the
D2 line of atomic Cs in our calculations (λ = 852nm) and
keep probe power, detuning and number of atoms ﬁxed
for all results presented in this section. Fig.4a shows the
total scattered power in the observation plane for short
samples of varying transverse size.

1/(w2

a + w2

The samples are probed by a wide (w0 = 1000µm)
probe beam. The scattering eﬃciency drops dramatically
with increasing sample size as expected. A comparison
with the 1/w2
0) dependence from our ana-
a ·
lytical estimate shows perfect agreement. The full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity distribution
in the observation plane (Fig.4b) reﬂects the interplay of
source size and diﬀraction in the propagation of the scat-
tered wave. In fact, our observation plane is not located
in the true far ﬁeld for all source sizes and the observed
dependence is equivalent to the behavior of the spread
of varying size Gaussian beams at a ﬁxed ﬁnite distance
from their minimum waist position.

We investigate now how the scattered power changes
with the length of the sample. In Fig.5a we show the re-
sult for a narrow sample probed by a wide beam together
with the analytical prediction as a function of sample
length in units of zra. The rather good agreement with
the simple function was our motivation to design the ex-
pression for θef f accordingly.
In Fig.5b we repeat the
calculation over a larger range of scaled length for various
transverse sizes of the sample for wide (open squares in
Fig.5b) and narrow (open circles in Fig.5b) probe beam.
The length of atomic sample is scaled here in units of
˜zra and the scattered power is normalized to its value at
inﬁnitesimally short sample length.

The estimate with our simple analytical formula is rea-
sonable also over this larger range showing quantitative
agreement at the level of 20% for scaled sample length
up to (L0/˜zra) = 8. The fact, that scaled data for a large
probe beam diameter agree among each other much bet-
ter than with data from a small beam diameter is under-
standable from the way eq.(14) was derived, i.e. neglect-

ing explicitly the change of the probe beam geometry
over the length of the sample. To understand the eﬀects
of changing probe geometry we consider the sample cut
into thin slices. We can identify each slice as a source
for a Gaussian beam wavelet, which initially inherits the
phase proﬁle of the probe beam and develops wavefront
curvature upon propagation. Scattered wavefronts from
the back end and the front end of the sample will thus
have diﬀerent curvature limiting the overlap to small an-
gles around the forward direction. Our analytic formula
works well for a plane probe wavefront, but fails to take
into account the positive eﬀect of a focused probe beam,
which imprints wavefront curvature of the right sign to
enhance wavefront overlap. For this reason the scaled
scattering eﬃciency is slightly higher for narrow probe
beams and intermediate sample length than the model
predicts. For very elongated samples we see a systematic
deviation of the analytical model from the numerical re-
sult and going to extremely elongated geometries we ob-
serve a diﬀerent power-law of the decay than suggested by
the simple analytic model (see Appendix A). We refrain
here from further tuning of the analytic model, since this
limiting case is of little interest for coupling all atoms of
a realistic sample eﬃciently to the light ﬁeld and accu-
rate quantitative data can be obtained easily numerically
whenever needed, anyway. We deﬁne the geometric fac-
tor gL as the function describing universally the length
dependence:

gL = Psc(L0)/Psc(0)

1 + (L0/˜zra)2

≃

(15)

The third important parameter which can be varied
in a real experiment is the probe beam size. A probe
beam size very much larger than the sample size will
not be optimum. While the sample is illuminated homo-
geneously the ﬁeld strength experienced by the atoms is

p

rather low. The dependence with decreasing probe diam-
eter predicted by eq.(14) is the result of a subtle interplay
of increased single atom scattering at higher intensities,
increased coherent scattering eﬃciency for the subset of
atoms which is inside the volume covered by the probe
beam and decrease of the number of scatterers contribut-
ing eﬀectively to the scattered ﬁeld. In Fig.6a we show
the scattered power as a function of probe beam size for
various sample length. Again we ﬁnd that the transverse
probe beam size dependence is described very well by the
analytic formula for the case of a short sample. For short
samples it is advantageous to use a probe beam size as
small as possible. For longer samples both the numerical
calculation as well as the analytical estimate predict a
ﬁnite probe beam diameter for optimum scattering eﬃ-
ciency. For reasons already discussed in the context of
Fig.5b the analytical estimate starts to deviate from the
numerical result for probe diameters comparable or less
than the sample diameter, but works very well already for
ratios as small as 2. We separate the trivial dependence
on probe intensity and degree of transverse localization
(
a ) from the observed behavior and deﬁne a
∝
geometric factor gT describing the inﬂuence of the ratio
of beam size to sample size w0/wa on the sample scat-
tering eﬃciency as:

(16)

For the polarization interferometric setup in Fig.1b it
is not possible to adapt the reference wavefront to the
scattered wavefront separately, so instead of maximizing
the scattering eﬃciency only, one needs to choose the
input beam size, such that the scattered mode has also
good overlap with the input mode. For short samples
it is easy to see, that this can be achieved only with a
probe size much smaller than the sample width, since in

this limit the probe traverses a homogeneous region of
the sample. For longer samples the scattering cone nar-
rows and one can achieve good overlap also for a probe
size comparable to the sample width. Equating the far-
ﬁeld diﬀraction angle of the input beam with the eﬀective
diﬀraction angle for light scattered oﬀ the sample, we can
derive an expression for the sample length which approx-
imately matches input and output modes:

The interesting region for the ratio w0/wa is values bigger
than 1, i.e. probe sizes comparable or bigger than the
sample size. The predictions of the above equation are
shown graphically in Fig.6b. The values obtained from
the analytical formula provide good starting values for a
numerical optimization of this mode-matching problem.
With our numerical calculations we explored the range
of validity of a simple analytical estimate for the scatter-
ing eﬃciency from samples of diﬀerent size and found
quantitative agreement at the 20% level over a large
range of parameters.

IV. APPLICATION TO A DIPOLE TRAPPED
SAMPLE

The formula and numerical calculation suggest that
a global optimum for the scattering eﬃciency exists for
any sample, which simply consists in placing all scatter-
ers in one point in space. This optimum is, alas, un-
physical, because dipole-dipole interaction in that case
dominates the scattering physics and, more pragmati-
cally, a trapped sample is subject to density limitations

because of collision induced heating and losses. In the
following we study the case of atoms trapped in a sin-
gle gaussian beam dipole trap. In thermal equilibrium
the shape of the atomic sample in a single beam dipole
trap is determined by the focal parameter of the beam
[32, 33]. We take parameters for Cs atoms trapped by
laser radiation at λdip = 1030nm at a constant trap
1mK and ﬁxed sample temperature
depth of U0 = kB ·
of T = 100µK. Specifying the dipole trap laser power
determines then the focal parameter needed to achieve
the trap depth, and thus also the thermal radius wa and
length L0 of the sample. Limiting the peak density to
npeak = 1012cm−3 speciﬁes then the number of atoms
Nat. From Fig.6a we infer that for long samples a probe
beam size equal to the sample size will be close to opti-
mum and choose this for the calculation. Restoring all
prefactors and choosing a number of incident probe pho-
tons nph = 108 [34] at a detuning ∆/Γ = 100 we can
then numerically determine the achievable SNR accord-
ing to eq.(5) at unity quantum eﬃciency as a function
of the power of the dipole trap laser. In Fig.7a we show
the achievable SNR in this conﬁguration, together with
the number of trapped atoms. We observe that for big-
ger samples the SNR approaches a constant value. With
the constraints we placed on temperature and density,
the beneﬁt of having more atoms is reduced by the in-
creasingly unfavorable elongated geometry. It turns out
that while the aspect ratio of the sample increases with
increasing size of the dipole trap, the scaled length, i.e.
the Fresnel number, remains constant at L0/˜zra = 14
[35]. With this observation, the higher number of atoms
is outweighed exactly by the increasing transverse dimen-
sions of sample and probe beam.

A realistic model for coherent light-atom coupling eﬃ-
ciency will have to take into account also the losses due to
spontaneous emission. In fact, a measurement on atoms
with a spontaneous emission probability approaching 1

can hardly be considered non-destructive for the collec-
tive variable. The result from the 1-D quantum model in
eq.(2) predicts actually that the achievable SNR and the
level of destructiveness are coupled, i.e. the achievable
SNR is directly proportional to the integrated single atom
spontaneous emission rate η (see also [36, 37]). Since the
transverse size of the trapped sample changes with the
invested dipole trap power, η is not the same for the data
points in Fig.7a. In order to make a fair comparison we
thus calculate for each of the data points the number of
spontaneously emitted photons per atom by evaluating
the average intensity experienced by the atoms and inte-
grating over the pulse time (see Appendix B). In Fig.7b
we show the same data rescaled to a probe laser detun-
ing, such that η = 0.1 for every point, together with the
detuning needed to satisfy the constraint on η.

Including the condition of equal level of destructive-
ness restores the advantage of bigger samples over small
samples. We note that the absolute numbers for the cou-
pling strength at ﬁxed η cannot be changed by simulta-
neous variation of the detuning and the number of inci-
dent photons, since the coupling strength and η depend
in the same way on these two quantities. For the elon-
gated samples probed by a narrow beam the losses are
distributed quite unevenly over the sample due to the
rather inhomogeneous illumination.

V. RELATION TO EFFECTIVE 1-D MODELS

At the start of our scattering calculation we expressed
the coupling strength or achievable SNR in terms of a
number of coherently scattered photons. This number,
although convenient to calculate, is not a directly mea-
surable quantity, since we cannot distinguish coherently
scattered photons from the incident photons in princi-
ple and only their interference is observable. The results
from the previous sections allow us to express this arti-
ﬁcial scattered power in terms of the incident power and

the interaction geometry. This also makes a direct com-
parison to the expression for the coupling strength de-
rived from the 1-D quantum model possible. Introducing
the transverse beam area Aph as πw2
0 and equivalently
the sample area Aat as πw2
a we rewrite eq.(14) in the
limit of large detuning as [38]:

we see how diﬀraction eﬀects modify the coupling
strength with respect to the predictions from the 1-D
model. The two expressions are similar for the case of a
sample with eﬀective Fresnel number of 1 and equal probe
and sample diameter [39]. For our choice of Gaussian
sample and probe the modiﬁcation of coupling strength
can be quantitatively accounted for by the geometrical
factors. We believe that the asymptotic scaling of the
geometrical factors will be independent of the speciﬁc
choice of the function describing the shape of the sam-
ple. We can look at the case of a very elongated sample
˜zra) probed by a narrow beam of the same size as
(L0 ≫

ingly and ﬁnd in this limit for the coupling strength:

The achievable coupling strength becomes independent
of the sample size in this limit and is linear in the peak
atomic density npeak, instead of being proportional to
column density as in the 1-D model [40]. The numerically
observed scaling with the length of the sample (see the
appendix) reduces the coupling even more for extremely
elongated samples.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have outlined an eﬃcient method to
include diﬀraction eﬀects in the coupling of light to col-
lective variables of atomic samples and applied it to an
experimentally relevant case of atomic ensembles stored
in single beam dipole traps. The use of gaussian light
ﬁelds is well adapted to real experimental geometries and
allows for a largely analytical treatment. Tayloring the
sample and beam geometry, such that probe mode and
scattered mode coincide is possible and will be useful for
polarization interferometry or multi-pass experiments.

Several approximations have been made, mainly to
keep the model as transparent as possible, and some of
them can be lifted in future extensions of the model. The
leading order eﬀect of multiple scattering and particle
statistics on the refractive index, which we are eﬀectively
calculating in a single scattering approximation, can be
accounted for by a correction term depending on the
local density of scatterers which will allow to calculate
the geometry of the scattered mode also for higher
densities [41].

Our model is classical in nature, but the point scat-
terer model can be used also to analyze quantum noise
contributions and their dependence on geometry. Giving
up the continuous density distribution one can determine
numerically the scattering eﬃciency from randomly dis-
tributed samples and this way statistically analyze the
noise introduced onto the scattered wavefront by density
ﬂuctuations on diﬀerent length scales. This models spon-
taneous emission noise as well as nontrivial eﬀects like the
inherent mode-matching noise discussed in [13]. There
are already studies using a wave function Monte-Carlo
technique to address the eﬀects of spontaneous emission
in a quantum description [42] adapted for our case of
trapped inhomogeneous samples, but the extremely fast
increase of the dimensionality of Hilbert space limits the
treatment to very small numbers of atoms only. A clas-
sical point scatterer calculation can be used conveniently
also to model experimental imperfections, e.g. alignment
errors, where the analytical integration over the trans-
verse distribution would become much more involved.

The assumption of inﬁnitely heavy scatterers, i.e. the
neglect of photon recoil, needs closer attention, when the
ﬂuctuations of collective variables are studied. In fact,
when working with collective atomic variables one usu-
ally assumes that internal and external degrees of free-
dom of the atomic sample are decoupled. Already with-

11

out multiple scattering the change of momentum due to
scattering introduces correlations between internal and
external variables [43]. Also, a focused probe beam with
inhomogeneous intensity distribution across the sample
exerts a dipole force on the sample leading to contrac-
tion or expansion depending on the sub-level populations
for the setup in Fig.1a. This leads to an eﬀective de-
cay mechanism for the macroscopic coherence between
the sub-levels. Similar eﬀects occur naturally also at the
level of quantum ﬂuctuations. Ultimately, a proper quan-
tum model will have to take into account the scatter-
ing induced dynamics of the density correlation function
of the sample, which determines the structure factor for
light scattering [44, 45]. Prominent examples for the key
importance of the photon recoil for collective scattering
are the observation of super-radiant Rayleigh and Raman
scattering in Bose-Einstein condensates [46, 47], cavity
cooling [48, 49] and collective motion in high-ﬁnesse cav-
ities [50].

VII. APPENDIX

A.

The analytical estimate for the total scattered power
given in eq.(14) is seen to fail for very elongated sam-
ples. This can be traced back to the assumption of ho-
mogeneous illumination in the calculation of the on-axis
intensity of the scattered ﬁeld. A simple way to arrive at
an improved estimate is to introduce an axial average of
the incident intensity in order to take into account the
diﬀractive spreading of the incident beam over the sample
length. Since the scattering eﬃciency depends quadrati-
cally on atom number, the average is performed over the
squared density distribution and to simplify the math
the gaussian atomic density distribution is replaced by a
rectangular distribution of same peak height and area:

Within the framework of the point scatterer model the
distinction between spontaneous and induced emission is
blurred and with the approximation of a microscopically
continuous density distribution for the point scatterers
spontaneous emission is completely lost. Introducing im-
plicitly microscopic density ﬂuctuations and assuming
that single atom spontaneous emission happens indepen-
dently of the presence of the neighboring scatterers the
spontaneously emitted power can be calculated as:

not very meaningful when done globally, since the inte-
grated spontaneous emission rate can have substantial
local variations due to the inhomogeneous illumination.
In addition, the contribution of a central volume element
to the total scattered ﬁeld and thus to the scattering ef-
ﬁciency is much bigger than for a volume element on the
rim of the density distribution. This means that a spon-
taneous emission or optical pumping event in the center
of the sample leads to a more pronounced change in the
scattering eﬃciency. In a quantum description the spatial
inhomogeneity of both light and atom variables naturally
suggests importance sampling and leads to a concept of
collective variables which are no longer fully symmetric
with respect to exchange of single particle labels [14].

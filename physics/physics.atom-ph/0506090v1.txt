Abstract. The interaction of Na atoms with a surface was probed by inserting a
nanofabricated material grating into one arm of an atom interferometer (IFM). This technique
permits a direct measurement of the change in phase and coherence of matter waves as they
pass within 25 nm of the grating bar surface. The practical concerns and challenges of making
such a measurement are discussed here. Interference of spurious diﬀraction orders, IFM path
overlap, and the partial obscuration of IFM beams are all important aspects of this experiment.
The systematic eﬀects that contribute to the measured phase shift and contrast are discussed.

Atomic diﬀraction from material grating structures [1] has been used as a tool to measure
atom-surface interactions for noble gases [2] and alkali atoms [3, 4]. In these experiments the
van der Waals (vdW) interaction [5] changed the relative intensities of the diﬀraction orders.
More recently the atom wave phase shift Φ0 induced by these grating structures1 was measured
directly using a sodium atom beam interferometer (IFM) [6]. The experimental setup is shown
in Fig. 1. An interaction grating (IG), comprised of an array of 50 nm wide channels, is inserted
into one arm of the IFM. The vdW interaction between the sodium atoms and IG causes a
phase shift of about Φ0 ∼ 0.3 radians. A number of systematic eﬀects need to be understood
before reporting this phase shift induced by the vdW interaction. This paper describes how the
measured phase shift and contrast in [6] are inﬂuenced by these systematic eﬀects and suggests
some physical mechanisms for them.

In general there is a non-trivial relationship between the measured phase shift Φmeas and
induced phase shift Φ0, when the IFM paths are partially obscured by a phase shifting element.
Therefore, care should be taken when interpreting the phase shift data. This notion of partial
obscuration is shown in Fig. 2, which illustrates how the interference pattern can have diﬀerent
phases in diﬀerent regions of space. The detected interference signal can be written as the
average ﬂux transmitted through each grating window of G3 in Fig. 1

Figure 1. Experimental setup for using an atom interferometer (IFM) to measure the vdW
induced phase shift. An IFM is formed using the zeroth and ﬁrst order diﬀracted beams of
gratings G1 and G2. Placing the interaction grating (IG) in one of the interferometer paths
causes the interference pattern at the third grating G3 to shift in space. The IG has been
perforated (light grey line) to allow the reference arm of the IFM to pass unaﬀected. The ﬂux
transmitted through G3 is the detector signal S(θ).

where the contrast (Cl), phase (φl), and average intensity (hIli) of the interference pattern are
assumed to be constant over each grating window l of G3. The grating window size w and
period d in Eqn. 1 refer to grating G3.2 The variable θ = 2πx3/d accounts for the position of
G3 relative to the interference pattern phase φl. Equation 1 establishes a connection between
the spatial interference pattern, shown just before G3 in Fig. 1, and the signal S(θ) which is
actually measured.

From Eqn. 1 it is clear that the detector signal S(θ) is a sum of cosines with varying phases
φl and intensities ClhIli. When determining the measured phase Φmeas of the signal it is only
the relative phase and intensity of the terms in Eqn. 1 that are important. For the case of a
half-plane phase shifting element (e. g. the IG in Fig. 2) the form for the detector signal implied
by Eqn. 1 would be

S(θ) ∝ A cos(θ) + B cos(θ + Φ0) ≡ D cos(θ + Φmeas),

where constant oﬀsets in the signal have been ignored. The intensity of the detector signal can
then be given by

and the phase by

where A and B are the relative intensities of the unshifted and shifted interference patterns.
The resulting phase and contrast measured by S(θ) can also be found for more complicated
interference patterns by using Eqn. 2 in an iterative fashion.

(dashed) fails to reproduce several features in
the phase and contrast, which are explained
when systematic eﬀects are included (solid).

the value for the induced phase Φ0 and the

the
interferometer beams α and β. In general the
interaction grating (IG) may only induce a
phase shift to part of the beam, resulting in an
interference pattern that has diﬀerent phases
in diﬀerent regions of space. As indicated by
the dark grey region the beams can also have
some overlap resulting in a more complicated
interference pattern.

Figure 3 shows the measured phase and contrast of S(θ) when the interaction grating is
placed at a given location xIG inside the atom IFM. All phase measurements are relative to
the situation where the IG is out of the IFM, and this reference phase was regularly measured.
As one would expect the measured phase reaches a local extremum when the IG is completely
obscuring one of the IFM paths. When the IG begins to obscure both of the IFM paths one
would presume that the measured phase should return to zero again. However, the Φmeas data
deviate from this prediction. Likewise, the contrast should decrease when the IG attenuates
one of the IFM paths, but then return to its nominal value when both paths are obscured. In
addition, the beam overlap shown in Fig. 2 will tend to make the measured phase smaller than
the induced phase because the overlapped portion will have no relative phase diﬀerence. These
expectations are made quantitative by the use of Eqn. 2 and shown as the dashed line in Fig. 3.

Figure 4. Explanation for the observed
phase shift when both interferometer paths
are obscured by the IG. The other diﬀraction
orders can interfere leading to additional
contributions to S(θ).
It is possible for
the IG to obscure both of the primary
interferometer paths while only obscuring one
of the secondary paths, leading to a phase
shifted component.

Figure 5. Explanation for contrast reduction
when the IG obscures both interferometer
paths.
The IG support bars eﬀectively
operates like a mask. When the beams
are recombined only the dark grey area will
have signiﬁcant contrast, leading to an overall
reduction in the observed contrast in S(θ).
The inset SEM image shows how the IG has
been prepared with a sharp transition from
gap to intact grating.

There are two striking failures of this naive prediction when compared to the experimental data:
the appearance of a phase shift and signiﬁcant loss of contrast when both IFM paths are obscured
by the IG.

The appearance of the extra phase features can be understood by looking more carefully
at the details of the IFM. Our IFM is formed by the zeroth and ﬁrst order diﬀracted beams
of the gratings G1 and G2 in Fig. 1. In reality there are more than just two paths that can
interfere because of the other diﬀraction orders. This situation is depicted in Fig. 4. These
additional interfering paths allow for the possibility of the IG to obscure both of the primary
interferometer paths, while only obscuring one of the secondary interferometer paths. When
this notion is combined with the ﬁnite size of the detector and diﬀraction caused by the third
grating G3, a clear mechanism for the extra phase features is found.

A likely explanation for the unexpected reduction in contrast, when both interferometer paths
are obscured by the IG, is shown in Fig. 5. The inset SEM image in Fig. 5 shows how the
diﬀraction bars (which cause the atom-surface phase shift) are stabilized by much more widely
spaced support bars. The support bars will imprint a spatial amplitude modulation on the two
beams, shifted in space by diﬀerent amounts with respect to the center of the beams. When
the beams are recombined the region of overlap is eﬀectively reduced, leading to an overall
reduction in contrast. While there are some near-ﬁeld diﬀractive eﬀects caused by the support
bars [7], numerical simulations have shown that the eﬀective mask picture in Fig. 5 is still
appropriate when considering the inﬂuence on S(θ). It is important to note that this eﬀect only

reduces the contrast for an IFM that has both paths obscured by the IG. This also explains the
relative prominence of the extra phase features, since the contrast of the primary interferometer
is reduced compared to the secondary one as a result of this eﬀect.

When the previously discussed systematic eﬀects are incorporated into the coeﬃcients A and
B in Eqn. 2, much better agreement with the data is achieved. The solid line in Fig. 3 shows
the prediction of a model which includes the inﬂuence of other interfering orders and the support
bars. It is quite satisfying to see that the behavior of the measured contrast and phase is now
understood even when the IG is blocking both of the primary interferometer paths. One can
also see that the asymmetry of the phase proﬁle is reproduced.

In conclusion the measured phase and contrast as a function of IG position are now understood
to be inﬂuenced by a number of systematic eﬀects. The primary physical mechanisms for the
systematic eﬀects are beam overlap, interference of additional diﬀraction orders, and an eﬀective
masking by the IG support bars. The inclusion of systematic eﬀects leads to a relationship
between the phase shift that is measured (Φmeas) with our experiment and that which is actually
induced (Φ0) by the IG. This allows us to make quantitative comparisons to predictions for the
phase shift Φ0 and in turn the vdW coeﬃcient C3 [6].

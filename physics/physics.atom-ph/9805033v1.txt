The main properties of the interaction of ultra low-energy antiprotons (E ≤ 10

−6 a.u.) with
atomic hydrogen are established. They include the elastic and inelastic cross sections and Protonium
(Pn) formation spectrum. The inverse Auger process (P n + e → H + ¯p) is taken into account
in the framework of an unitary coupled-channels model. The annihilation cross-section is found
to be several times smaller than the predictions made by the black sphere absorption models. A
family of ¯pH nearthreshold metastable states is predicited. The dependence of Protonium formation
probability on the position of such nearthreshold S-matrix singularities is analysed. An estimation
for the H ¯H annihilation cross section is obtained.

I. INTRODUCTION

The unique features of the LEAR (low-energy antiproton ring) facility at CERN made recently possible the synthesis
of few antihydrogen atoms [1]. This eﬀort would be pursued with the antiproton deccelerator (AD) project [2] and
would make possible the storage of sensible amounts of antihydrogen. This project reinforces the already active
interest to investigate several theoretical and experimental problems in the physics of antimatter [3–7].

In view of storing antimatter in traps, it would be interesting to have some theoretical calculations of the rate at
which antiprotons (¯p) and antihydrogen ( ¯H) annihilate with the residual gas. This process should be evaluated at
subkelvin temperatures, the optimal energy domain for an eﬀective synthesis and trapping of antimatter.

From a theoretical standpoint, a speciﬁc feature of systems like H + ¯p or H + ¯H, containing pairs of unlike charged
heavy particles (p and ¯p), is the possibility of rearrangement followed by Protonium (Pn) formation. Indeed even at
zero ¯p kinetic energy Protonium can be produced in states with principal quantum number n

30.

Since the pioneer work of E. Fermi and E. Teller [8] in 1947, this problem has been treated by several authors
[9,10,12] in the energy range going from a fraction to tens a.u.. The usual approach is based on the following two
i) the separation of electronic and nuclear motion and ii) the classical treatment of the antiproton
assumptions:
dynamics. The aim of the present work is to provide a correct description of the ultra-low energy limit, i.e. T ¯p < 10−6
a.u., an energy domain in which the above mentioned assumptions are no longer valid. As a consequence we are
deﬁnitely faced to a quantum three- or four-body problem.

≤

We will consider in what follows the annihilation of ultra slow antiprotons with atomic hydrogen in the framework

of an unitary coupled channel approach. This process will be identiﬁed to the free Pn formation:

as far as the direct annihilation at such low energies can be neglected and that the further evolution of Pn states will
result into annihilation.

In our treatment the Protonium formation as well as the virtual rearrangement process, i.e. the inverse reaction of

(1):

will be properly taken into account.

We will show that the energy dependence of the inelastic reaction probability is determined by a rich spectrum
of nearthreshold S-matrix singularities, corresponding to H ¯p nearthreshold metastable states generated by the long
range charge-dipole interaction. Finally we will give an estimation of the H ¯H annihilation cross-section in the energy
range from 10−8 to 10−4 a.u.

II. THE FORMALISM

→

The adequate formalism for the three-body problem are the Faddeev equations [13], according to which three
possible asymptotic clusters have to be explicitly described. In the case of slow antiprotons scattering on hydrogen
only two of them are physically important. The ﬁrst one is the (pe)¯p cluster, which corresponds to the elastic
channel H + ¯p
H + ¯p. The second one is the (p¯p)e cluster, corresponding to the Protonium formation channels
H + ¯p

→
P n∗ + e.

A direct solution of the Faddeev equations for such a problem is made diﬃcult by the big number of open channels
containing fast oscillating asymptotics. In this section we will develop a formalism which enables to take into account
the correct behavior of the three-body wavefunction in both mentioned asymptotic clusters and beneﬁt from the small
value of the electron-antiproton mass ratio. We will show that this approach gives the scattering observables with an
accuracy of the order of
10% by using a very limited number of channels. In the same time it provides a transparent
physical understanding of the low energy three-body dynamics in the ¯pH reaction, which was the main aim of our
study.

∼

The Jacobi coordinates for the 3-body problem are connected with the possible diﬀerent asymptotic clusters. The

coordinates corresponding to the elastic channel are deﬁned by

where re, Rp and R¯p are respectively the electron, proton and antiproton coordinates, and me Mp are the electron
and proton mass.

It turns out that this frame is also convenient for describing the Protonium production channels. Indeed, the p-¯p
R¯p, coincides within r(me/Mp) with R in equation (3). We will show that knowing the three-body
distance ρ = Rp
−
wavefunction at r
ρ(Mp/me) is enough to get a good approximation of the scattering observables. Thus we can
substitute ρ by R and take into account, if necessary, the diﬀerence between ρ and R in a perturbative way. We will
use hereafter the unique coordinate system (3).

≪

The three-body wavefunction is represented as a sum of two components, corresponding to the two considered

clusters:

Component Φ1 is supposed to describe the elastic channel and can be written as

where α is the set of quantum numbers labeling the Hydrogen atomic states φα as well as the corresponding antiproton
wavefunction χα. We will denote from now by channel each term in the three-body wavefunction expansion like (5).
For incident antiproton energy much smaller than the ﬁrst Hydrogen excitation threshold, it is convenient to select

from (5) only the contributions which do not vanish in the asymptotics. This gives the simple form:

It is useful to introduce a projection operator ˆP , which acts in the three-body states space and projects on the
subspace of Hydrogen states corresponding to open channels:

In our case the sum is limited to the 1s state only. Component Φ1 is then written as:

Φ2 = (ˆ1

The second component Φ2 describes all the remaining channels and can be written in the form:

−
This means that all the electron states except 1s contribute into Φ2 ensuring the orthogonality of both components.
The Φ2 component contains terms which correspond to the Protonium formation channels. In order to explicitly take
into account the asymptotic behavior of the cluster (p¯p)e, Φ2 is expanded in a complete set of the (p¯p) eigenfunctions
fβ(R):

where gβ(r) are unknown expansion coeﬃcients representing the electron wavefunctions in the channels characterized
by Protonium quantum numbers β.

Let us remark here that at this level no approximation has been done. In particular the truncation done in the

choice (6) of Φ1 is balanced in the functions gβ of the second component.

The corresponding equations for the antiproton χ(R) and electron wave-functions gβ(r) could be obtained by
substituting (6) and (10) into (15). Due to the choice of the wavefunction components the solution of such a coupled
equations system will correctly describe the asymptotic behavior of the three-body system. This procedure will
however remain formal, for it leads to an inﬁnite set of coupled channels, including the closed ones, characterized by
a continuous p¯p momentum variable. To construct an equation system suitable for practical calculations, we should
ﬁrst analyze the contribution of diﬀerent channels in the expansion (10).
In particular, the one coming from the
continuous spectrum. For such a purpose we represent Φ2 as a sum of two components:

below which S-wave dominates in the elastic channel will be determined later.

It was shown in [15,16] that in the L = 0 case, Protonium is primarily produced in states with angular momentum
l = 0 and l = 1. The physical reason is that for the open channels with n=26-30, which dominate the reaction
amplitude, the electron is ejected with rather small momentum ke, and the centrifugal barrier reduces the probability
to ﬁnd a slow electron (and consequently Protonium) with high angular momentum.

4

The preceding results enable us to construct a model which, including a limited number of channels, correctly
describes the asymptotic behavior of the three-body wavefunction. These channels dominate the reaction amplitude,
while closed channels corresponding to the continuous spectrum of Protonium states, are taken into account by means
of the polarization potential (20). In practical calculations we have included the Protonium channels with principal
quantum number n=10-40 and angular momentum l = 0, 1. Numerical checks showed the stability of the results when
increasing the number of included channels. The considered equation system has the form:

D. Eﬀective potential method

The numerical solution of (21-22) is a rather diﬃcult task, as far as each of the coupled integro-diﬀerential equations

includes fast oscillating functions χ and fn.

A way to overcome this diﬃculty is by means of the eﬀective potential method. This approach turned to be an
eﬃcient tool for both a qualitative understanding and precise numerical treatment of the problem. The H ¯p scattering
observables are given by the ﬁrst equation for antiproton wavefunction χ (21). The eﬀects of the remaining coupled
equations (22) are taken into account by transforming the system (21-22) into one equation for χ which contains a
complex nonlocal eﬀective potential:

(25)

The whole problem is then splitted into two parts: to calculate the eﬀective potential and to solve the one-channel
problem for antiproton scattering in a complex nonlocal potential.

The beneﬁts of such an approach are several. On one hand the Green function (25) is calculated by solving a
coupled equation system for smooth electron wavefunctions, while the fast oscillating p¯p wavefunctions are explicitly

5

introduced by the well-known Coulomb states. On the other hand the eﬀective potential (24) practically does not
[15,16]. The minimum energy of the ejected electron
0.01 a.u.
depend on the ¯p incident energy in the domain E¯p ≪
(from Pn state with n=30) is about 0.02 a.u. and for ¯p energies less than this value, the Green-matrix (25) is not
sensitive to incident antiproton energy. This means that, once calculated for E¯p = 0, the eﬀective potential can be
used in the whole energy range of interest and this radically simpliﬁes the calculations.

From a physical point of view it seems also more natural to analyze the properties of the H¯p system in terms of a
modiﬁed one channel problem. The main features of the eﬀective potential as they appear from our calculations are
the following:

1. The imaginary part of Vef f vanishes at distance R

1.8rB, which corresponds to the mean radius of the last

Protonium open channel (n=30). In Fig. 1 Im[Vef f ](R, R′) for R′ = R is plotted as a function of R.

≈

2. The imaginary part of Vef f (R, R′) is sharply peaked around its diagonal R′ = R. Nevertheless for R < rB, the
nonlocality range is of the same order as the antiproton wavefunction χ(R) oscillation period. The proﬁle of
Im[Vef f ](R, R′) for R = 0.5 is shown on Fig. 2.

3. The proﬁle of the real part of Vef f is plotted in Fig. 3. Its nonlocality range is bigger than for the imaginary
3rB and dominates over the polarization Vpol and the Coulomb screened Vcs potentials

part. It vanishes at R
in the range 1 < R < 3rB

≈

In this section we will present the main results obtained in the coupled-channels model and discuss the physical

reasons of certain scattering observables behavior.

The H ¯p complex scattering length is found to be:

The corresponding elastic cross-section at zero energy is:

We remark the relatively big value, in the atomic scale, of the scattering length imaginary part. Such value is a
consequence of the long range polarization forces. By switching oﬀ Vpol in (23) the value obtained is substantially
reduced to Im(a) = 0.2rB. The capital role of the polarization forces in the low energy H¯p dynamics will be discussed
in the next subsection.

We have calculated the energy dependence of the inelasticity S2

r for several partial waves. The results are shown on
Fig. 4 for ¯p incident energies in the range from 0 to 10−6 a.u.. The inelasticity turns to be less than 0.1 for E¯p < 10−8
a.u. and does not become greater than 0.5 in the energy domain of interest. One can also see in this ﬁgure that the
scattering length approximation is valid for energies less than 10−8a.u. The results for l
= 0 have been calculated
under the assumption that the eﬀective potential (24) weakly depends on total angular momentum L in the energy
range of interest. As one can see, S-wave dominates for E¯p < 10−8a.u..

The total annihilation cross-section is shown on Fig. 5. It follows the 1/v-law for E¯p < 10−8 a.u. and decreases
nonmonotonously for E¯p > 10−8 a.u. Such nonmonotonic behavior is originated by the contribution of nonzero angular
momentum partial waves, which is explicitly seen on Fig. 4. It is interesting to compare this cross-section with a
semi-classical calculation [11] obtained under the following assumptions:
i) the ¯p motion can be treated classically
H distance is smaller than a critical
and ii) the annihilation takes place with unit probability as soon as the ¯p
radius Rc = 0.64rB. The semi-classical cross-section, shown on Fig. 5, is approximately 2.5 times bigger than our
values for E¯p < 10−8 a.u. . This indicates that the low-energy ¯pH annihilation is sensitive to the quantum dynamics
of Protonium formation and could hardly be reproduced with models in which the details of such dynamics are not
taken into account.

−

The population of diﬀerent Protonium states, calculated for energies E¯p < 10−8a.u. is shown on Fig. 6. Protonium
is produced primary in the S-states with principal quantum number 26 < n < 30. The P-states population does not
exceed 15% of the whole captured fraction of antiprotons. These results conﬁrm our qualitative estimation concerning

6

6
the channels which give the main contribution into the reaction amplitude in the low-energy limit. It is worth to
mention that Protonium S-states population dominates only for ¯p energies less than 10−8 a.u., while the population
of states with higher l should increase with increasing energy [17].

We conclude this paragraph by emphasizing that the H ¯p scattering observables signiﬁcantly change their behavior
10−8 a.u., a characteristic energy for the reaction. We will demonstrate that this behavior is determined by

at E¯p ∼
the presence of nearthreshold H ¯p bound and virtual states generated by the polarization potential.

B. Nearthreshold metastable states

The polarization potential is known to signiﬁcantly modify the low energy cross-sections of atomic reactions. It
plays an essential role in the H ¯p scattering. This potential produces a rich spectrum of H ¯p weakly-bound and virtual
states [18], which results from the long range character of the polarization forces and the heavy (in atomic scale)
antiproton mass. Such states, being nearthreshold S-matrix singularities, determine the energy dependence of the H ¯p
scattering cross-section. The main properties of such states and their relation with the observables are discussed in
this subsection.

We ﬁrst remark that the polarization potential Vpol alone generates several ¯p weakly-bound states. The energy
levels and mean radii of several nearest to the threshold S-states produced by Vpol alone are shown in Table I (values
marked by subscript II). These states are extremely prolonged and have very small binding energies. By switching on
the short range part of the interaction, i.e. the complex nonlocal eﬀective potential Vef f and the screened Coulomb
Vcs, the spectrum is modiﬁed and inelastic widths appear. Nevertheless, the main features, small binding energy
(10−8 < Ebound < 10−3 a.u.) and big radius (4 < ¯x < 27) rB, remain.

In the threshold vicinity the elastic S-matrix for L=0 is dominated by its singularities and can be written in the

form:

S
|

(k) =
|

k + zi|
|
zi|
k
−
|

i
Y

(26)

where zi are the S-matrix poles with Re(zi) < 0 due to Im(Vef f ) < 0. In Fig. 7 are shown the trajectories of several
S-matrix poles (Pi) and corresponding zeros (Zi) as a function of the strength of the Vef f imaginary part. As it can
be seen, the presence of the negative imaginary part in the eﬀective potential results in shifting the S-matrix zeros to
the right into the IV and I quadrants, with the corresponding symmetrical shift of S-matrix poles into the II and III
10−8 a.u.
ones. The position of the nearest to the origin S-matrix zero (and pole) corresponds to an energy of Ec ∼
and plays a role of characteristic energy for the reaction (1). We notice however that this nearest to the threshold
S-matrix singularity lies on the non-physical sheet, i.e. Re(k)< 0 and Im(k)< 0, and corresponds to a virtual state.
Its wave function has an exponentially incresing asymptotic and does not represent a physical state.

As far as the usual deﬁnition of eﬀective range can not be applied to the 1/R4 polarization potential [14], we

To illustrate how the position of the nearthreshold S-matrix singularities determines the low energy scattering,
we have calculated the inelasticity as a function of the dipole polarizability αd for a ﬁxed energy (E¯p = 10−8 and
E = 10−6 a.u.). This function is plotted on Fig. 8. The strong oscillations between its maximum and minimum
values with decreasing αd correspond to the motion of an S-matrix pole from the II to the III k-plane quadrant, while
the symmetric S-matrix zero moves from the IV to the I quadrant. This means, that a weakly bound state becomes
virtual. As it is seen from (26), the inelasticity reaches its maximum value when an S-matrix zero crosses the real
k-axis.

This last result shows that suﬃciently high accuracy of calculations is required to obtain the scattering length
10−8 a.u. is less sensitive to the exact position of
value. In the same time the reaction amplitude for energies E¯p ≫
the nearthreshold singularities and can be more easily calculated. We estimate our accuracy in the scattering length
results to be about 30%. This uncertainty appears mainly from approximation used for Vpol at short distances. To get
more precise results one should increase the number of accounted closed channels and take into account the diﬀerence

7

between ρ and R in (3). Such corrections seem not to be important for understanding the physics of the treated
process and are beyond the scope of present paper.

We would like to emphasize that the nearthreshold character of mentioned S-matrix poles and zeros is determined
by the long-range polarization potential.
In the same time their exact position in complex k-plane can not be
obtained without a proper treatment of the Protonium formation dynamics. In particular, the semiclassical black
10−6 a.u. . In terms of S-matrix analytical properties the
sphere condition does not hold in the energy domain E¯p ≤
coupling with Protonium production channels produces comparatively big (for the energy domain of interest) shifts
of the real part of the S-matrix zeros and reduces the inelasticity.

C. Local approximation of the eﬀective potential

It was shown that the energy dependence of the reaction probability is determined by the existence of several
nearthreshold states generated mainly by the long range polarization forces. This suggests the possibility to obtain
a local complex potential which would be equivalent to the full H ¯p interaction in the energy range of interest. By
equivalent we mean not only to reproduce the same reaction probabilities but to support the same nearthreshold

D. Hydrogen-Antihydrogen interaction

The results obtained for H ¯p interaction can be used for a qualitative treatment of diﬀerent atom-antiproton (A¯p)

and atom-antiatom (A ¯A) system.

It is of particular interest to estimate the H ¯H annihilation cross-section, and thus to examine the reaction:

H + ¯H

P n∗ + (e+e−)

→

The H ¯H system interacts at long distances via a dipole-dipole potential Vdd ∼ −
6.5/R6. This potential also generates
a spectrum of nearthreshold states. Some of them with L=0 are shown in Table III. In analogy with the (1) case one
can expect that the corresponding S-matrix singularities will determine the (28) reaction dynamics.

A qualitative estimation of the H ¯H potential can be obtained by adding to the same short-range part as in H ¯p case
the dipole-dipole long-range tail Vdd. The reaction (28) cross-section calculated in such a way is shown on Fig. 9.
10−5 a.u. , corresponding to the position of the nearest
The characteristic energy for this reaction was found to be

∼
A similar treatment can be used to estimate the inelasticity energy dependence for diﬀerent A¯p or A ¯A systems in
the low energy limit. For such a purpose one has to ﬁnd the nearest to the threshold S-matrix singularity, generated by
polarization potential. The necessary condition for the validity of such a qualitative approach is that the characteristic
range RA of the A¯p or A ¯A long-range interaction should be much greater than the inelastic range rA.

As it is seen from (24) the inelastic range is mainly determined by the mean radius of the last Protonium state

open channel and thus given by:

where MA and IA are the A¯p reduced mass and the ﬁrst ionization potential respectively, n is the principal quantum
number of the last open channel. A similar estimation for the A ¯A inelastic range rA ¯A can be obtained, if we take into
account that Positronium is produced in this collision:

Here MA ¯A is the reduced mass of the A ¯A system, εP s is the Positronium ground state energy.

Like in the H ¯p case, the presence of nearthreshold virtual states may considerably increase the characteristic range
of A¯p or A ¯A interaction. However it can be interesting to have a simple approximation of this range in the aim
of comparison with preliminary estimations (see also [12]). This is provided by the semiclassical condition for the
number N of states :

This condition may be rewritten as follows:

For the A¯p case we obtain:

The Protonium formation spectrum for the energies less than 10−8 a.u. has been calculated. We have shown
that the population of S-states with principal quantum number from 26 to 30 acounts for 75% of the total captured
fraction.

The reaction dynamics is found to be determined by the existence of several nearthreshold states. Such states are
produced by the long-range polarization potential and are shifted in the complex momentum plane by the coupling
with Protonium formation channels. The H ¯p scattering length appears to be very sensitive to the position of the
mentioned singularities and requires accurate calculations.

A local approximation of the eﬀective potential has been proposed for further applications.

It reproduces the

scattering observables in the considered energy range and has the same nearthreshold spectral properties.

A qualitative extension of this approach to more general systems (atom-¯p and atom-antiatom) has been discussed.
The results discussed in this work have been obtained within an approximate model. In view of them and motivated
by the futur project of storing antimater at CERN it would be interesting to check the validity of the diﬀerent
approximations by developing more accurate treatments including an exact solution of the three body problem.

The authors would like to thank I.S. Shapiro for suggesting the problem. One of the authors (A.V.) would like to

thank D. Morgan for useful discussions.

An estimation of integrals (A10) can be obtained if we take into account the semiclassical character of the wave-
function χ0 and the Coulomb wavefunctions at R
rB in expansions (17) and (18). We are dealing with an integral of
fast-oscillating functions which has signiﬁcant values only if there exist stationary phase points inside the integration
region. The equation for such stationary phase points is:

It can be shown that there are no stationary phase points for Φp

We have, in conclusion, that in the energy domain of interest and large internucleon distances the contribution of
Φp
2 is the only important one and can be taken into account by introducing the polarization potential (A8), while at
the distances R
2 dominates, and can be described by a limited number of channels. These
qualitative arguments are important for construction of the ﬁrst approximation, and should be proved by further
numerical calculations.

Excitation energies of the ns1/2 (n= 7-10), npj (n = 7-9), ndj (n= 6-8), nfj (n= 5-7), and ngj
(n= 5-6) states in Th IV are evaluated. First-, second-, third-, and all-order Coulomb energies and
ﬁrst- and second-order Coulomb-Breit energies are calculated. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator
strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes are determined for the 96 possible nlj − n′l′
j′ electric-dipole
transitions. Multipole matrix elements (7s1/2 − 6dj , 7s1/2 − 5fj , and 5f5/2 − 5f7/2) are evaluated
to obtain the lifetimes of the 5f7/2 and 7s1/2 states. Matrix elements are calculated using both
relativistic many-body perturbation theory, complete through third order, and a relativistic all-
order method restricted to single and double (SD) excitations. Scalar and tensor polarizabilities for
the 5f5/2 ground state in Th3+ are calculated using relativistic third-order and all-order methods.
These calculations provide a theoretical benchmark for comparison with experiment and theory.

INTRODUCTION

A detailed investigation of radiative parameters for
electric dipole (E1) transitions in Fr-like ions with Z
= 89–92 was presented recently by Bi´emont et al. [1],
where relativistic Hartree-Fock and Dirac-Fock atomic
structure codes were used to calculate transition rates
and oscillator strengths for a limited number of tran-
sitions using experimental energies given by Blaise and
Wyart [2]. In the compilation [2], experimental energies
are given for 56 levels of neutral Fr, 24 levels of Fr-like
Th, and seven levels of Fr-like Ac and U. Experimental
energies for 13 levels of Fr-like Ra were reported in the
NIST compilation [3].

Lifetime measurements for the 7pj, 6dj, 9s1/2, and
8s1/2 levels of neutral francium were presented in Refs. [4,
5, 6, 7, 8]. In those papers, experimental measurements
were compared with ab-initio calculations performed by
Johnson et al. [9], by Dzuba et al. [10, 11], by Safronova
et al. [12], and by Safronova and Johnson [13]. Third-
order many-body perturbation theory was used in Ref. [9]
to obtain E1 transition amplitudes for neutral alkali-
metal atoms. The correlation potential method and the
Feynman diagram technique was used in Refs. [10, 11] to
calculate E1 dipole matrix elements in neutral francium
and in Fr-like radium. Calculations of atomic proper-
ties of alkali-metal atoms in Refs. [12, 13] were based

on the relativistic single-double (SD) approximation in
which single and double excitations of Dirac-Fock wave
functions were included in all orders in perturbation the-
ory.

In the present paper, relativistic many-body pertur-
bation theory (RMBPT) is used to determine energies,
matrix elements, oscillator strengths, and transition rates
for multipole transitions in Fr-like thorium. These cal-
culations start from a radonlike closed-shell Dirac-Fock
(DF) potential. It should be noted that Th IV is the ﬁrst
ion in francium isoelectronic sequence with a [Rn]5f5/2
ground state instead of a [Rn]7s1/2 ground state, as for
Fr I, Ra II, and As III. Correlation corrections become
very important for such systems as was recently demon-
strated in Savukov et al. [14], where it was shown that
the ratio of the second-order to lowest-order removal en-
ergy for the [Xe]4f5/2 ground state in Ce IV and Pr V is
18 % and 11 %, respectively.

− 5fj, and 5f5/2

We calculate excitation energies of ns1/2 (n= 7-10),
npj (n = 7-9), ndj (n= 6-8), nfj (n= 5-7), and ngj (n=
5-6) states in Fr-like thorium. Reduced matrix elements,
oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes are de-
termined for the 96 possible nlj − n′l′
j′ electric-dipole
− 6dj,
transitions. Multipole matrix elements (7s1/2
− 5f7/2) are evaluated to ob-
7s1/2
tain the lifetimes of 5f7/2 and 7s1/2 states. Scalar and
tensor polarizabilities of the 5f5/2 ground state of Th3+
are also calculated. Matrix elements are calculated using
both relativistic many-body perturbation theory, com-
plete through third order, and the relativistic all-order
method restricted to single and double (SD) excitations.
Such calculations permit one to investigate the conver-
gence of perturbation theory and estimate the error in

theoretical data.

II. THIRD-ORDER AND ALL-ORDER RMBPT
CALCULATIONS OF ENERGIES

As mentioned in the introduction, we carry out all of
the calculations in this work using two methods, third-
order MBPT, described in [9], and the relativistic all-
order SD method, described in [15, 16] and references
therein. The SD method includes correlation corrections
in a more complete way and is expected to yield more
accurate results, especially when correlation corrections
are signiﬁcant. While the SD method includes fourth-
and higher-order terms, it omits some third-order terms.
These omitted terms are identiﬁed and added to our SD
data (see [16] for details).

We use the B-spline method [17] to generate a com-
plete set of basis DF orbitals for use in the evaluation
of RMBPT expressions. For Th IV, we use 50 splines
of order k = 8 for each angular momentum. The basis
orbitals are constrained to a spherical cavity of radius R
= 45 a.u.. The cavity radius is chosen large enough to
accommodate all nlj orbitals considered here and small
enough that 50 splines can approximate inner-shell DF
wave functions with good precision. We use only 40 out of
50 basis orbitals for each partial wave in our third-order
and all-order energy calculations since contributions from
higher-energy orbitals are negligible.

Results of our energy calculations for the 28 states
of Th IV are summarized in Table I. Columns 2–7 of
Table I give the lowest-order DF energies E(0), second-
and third-order Coulomb correlation energies, E(2) and
E(3), ﬁrst-order Breit contribution B(1), second-order
Coulomb-Breit corrections B(2), and the Lamb shift ELS.
The sum of these six contributions is our ﬁnal third-order
RMBPT result E(3)
tot listed in the eighth column of Table I.
The all-order SD energies are listed in the column ESD,
and that part of the third-order energy omitted in the
SD calculation is given in column E(3)
extra. We note that
ESD includes E(2) completely. We take the sum of the
six terms E(0), ESD, E(3)
extra, B(1), B(2), and ELS to be
our ﬁnal all-order result ESD
tot , listed in the eleventh col-
umn of Table I. Experimental energies from Blaise and
Wyart [2] are given in the column labeled Eexpt. Dif-
ferences between third-order and experimental energies
δE(3) = E(3)
− Eexpt, and between SD and experimental
tot
− Eexpt, are given in the last two
energies δESD = ESD
tot
columns of Table I, respectively.

As expected, the largest correlation contribution to the
valence energy comes from the second-order term E(2).
This term is relatively simple to calculate; thus, we cal-
culate E(2) with better numerical accuracy than E(3)
and ESD. The second-order energy E(2) includes par-
tial waves up to lmax = 8 and is extrapolated to account
for contributions from higher partial waves (see, for ex-
ample, [18, 19]). As an example of the convergence of
E(2) with the number of partial waves l, consider the

2

5f5/2 state in Th IV. Calculations of E(2) with lmax =
6 and 8 yield E(2)(5f5/2) = −30810 and −31771 cm−1,
respectively. Extrapolation of these calculations yields
−32100 and −32154 cm−1, respectively. Therefore, we
estimate the numerical uncertainty of E(2)(5f5/2) to be
approximately 54 cm−1. It should be noted that this is
the largest contribution from the higher partial waves,
since we obtain a numerical uncertainty of 26 cm−1 for
E(2)(6dj) and the numerical uncertainty of 1 cm−1 for
E(2)(7sj). Similar convergence patterns are found for all
other states considered.

We use lmax = 6 in our all-order calculations owing to
the numerical complexity of the ESD calculation. As we
noted above, the second-order E(2) is contained in the
ESD value. Therefore, we use our high-precision calcu-
lation of E(2) described above to account for the contri-
butions of the higher partial waves. We simply replace
E(2)[lmax = 6] value with the ﬁnal high-precision second-
order value E(2)
ﬁnal. The same number of partial waves,
lmax = 6, is used in the third-order calculation. Since
the asymptotic l-dependence of the second- and third-
order energies are similar (both fall oﬀ as l−4), we use
the second-order remainder as a guide to estimate the
numerical errors in the third-order contribution. The
contribution E(3)
extra given in Table I accounts for that
part of the third-order RMBPT correction not included
in the SD energy. The values of E(3)
extra are smaller than
the values of E(3) by approximately a factor of 3.

The ﬁrst-order Breit energies (column B(1) of Table I)
include retardation, whereas the second-order Coulomb-
Breit energies (column B(2) of Table I) are evaluated us-
ing the unretarded Breit operator. The total E(3)
tot in
Table I is the sum of six terms, E(0), E(2), E(3), B(1),
B(2), and ELS. We ﬁnd that the correlation corrections
to energies are large, especially for the 5fj states. For
example, E(2) is about 15% of E(0) and E(3) is about
36% of E(2) for the 5fj states. Despite the evident slow
convergence of the perturbation theory expansion, the
5fj energy from the third-order RMBPT calculation is
within 0.9% of the measured energy. It should be noted
that correlation corrections are much smaller for all other
states; the ratios of E(0) and E(2) are equal to 6%, 5%,
and 2% for the 6dj, 7s1/2, and 10s1/2 states, respectively.
An important consequence of the large size of correlation
corrections for 5fj states is a diﬀerent ordering of un-
correlated and correlated energies. As can be seen from
Table I, −E(0) values for 6dj states are larger than −E(0)
values for 5fj states; however, −(E(0) + E(2)) values for
6dj states are smaller than −(E(0) + E(2)) values for 5fj
states; thus, although DF calculations predict the ground
state of Th IV to be 6d3/2, correlated calculations cor-
rectly predict the ground state to be 5f5/2.

The quantity ESD

tot in Table I is the sum of six terms;
E(0), ESD, E(3)
extra, B(1), B(2), and ELS). The column
labeled δESD in Table I gives diﬀerences between our ab
initio results and the experimental values [2]. The SD

results agree better with the experimental values than
the third-order RMBPT results for low-lying states where
the correlation correction is larger. Comparison of the
results given in two last columns of Table I shows that
the ratio of δE(3) and δESD is about 3 for the 5fj states.
As expected, including correlation to all orders led to
signiﬁcant improvement of the results. Better agreement
of the all-order values with experiment demonstrates the
importance of the higher order correlation contributions.

III. ELECTRIC-DIPOLE MATRIX ELEMENTS,
OSCILLATOR STRENGTHS, TRANSITION
RATES, AND LIFETIMES IN TH IV

A. Electric-dipole matrix elements

The calculation of the transition matrix elements pro-
vides another test of the quality of atomic-structure cal-
culations and another measure of the size of correlation
corrections. Reduced electric-dipole matrix elements be-
tween low-lying states of Th IV calculated in third order
RMBPT and in the SD approximation are presented in
Table II.

Third-order matrix elements Z (DF+2+3) include DF

contributions together with second-order Z (2) and third-
order Z (3) correlation corrections. Second- and third-
order random-phase-approximation (RPA) terms are it-
erated to all orders in the present calculation. Third-
order corrections include Brueckner orbital (BO), struc-
tural radiation Z (SR), and normalization Z (NORM) cor-
rections, in addition to the third-order RPA terms, see
[9]. The terms Z (RPA) and Z (BO) give the largest con-
tributions to the total. The sum of terms Z (RPA) and
Z (BO) is about 15–25% of Z (DF) and has a diﬀerent
sign. Structural radiation, and normalization corrections
are small. We ﬁnd correlation corrections Z (2+3) to be
very large, 10-25%, for many cases. All results given
in Table II are obtained using length-form matrix ele-
ments. Length-form and velocity-form matrix elements
diﬀer typically by 5–20 % for DF matrix elements and
2–5 % for the second-order matrix elements in these cal-
culations.

Electric-dipole matrix elements evaluated in the all-
order SD approximation are given in columns labeled
Z (SD) of Table II. The SD matrix elements Z (SD) in-
clude Z (3) completely, along with important fourth- and
higher-order corrections. The fourth-order corrections
omitted from the SD matrix elements were discussed re-
cently by Derevianko and Emmons [20]. The SD matrix

elements Z (SD) are smaller than Z (DF+2) but larger than
Z (DF+2+3) for all of the transitions listed in Table II.

B. Form-independent third-order transition
amplitudes

We calculate electric-dipole reduced matrix elements
using the form-independent third-order perturbation the-
ory developed by Savukov and Johnson in Ref. [21]. The
precision of this method has been demonstrated pre-
viously for alkali-metal atoms.
In this method, form-
dependent “bare” amplitudes are replaced with form-
independent random-phase approximation (“dressed”)
amplitudes to obtain form-independent third-order am-
plitudes. As in the case of the third-order energy calcu-
lation, a limited number of partial waves with lmax < 7
is included, giving rise to some loss of gauge invariance.
Comparison of length- and velocity-form matrix elements
serves as a measure of the numerical accuracy of the re-
sulting calculations.

Length- and velocity-form matrix elements from DF,
second-order, and third-order calculations are given in
Table III for the limited number transitions in Th IV.
Following the procedure discussed in Ref. [21], the DF
and RPA matrix elements in the table were obtained by
dividing the corresponding amplitude by the lowest-order
transition energies while the third-order matrix elements
were obtained by dividing the third-order amplitude by
the second-order transition energies. Values of Z (DF) dif-

Huge L − V diﬀerences in the Z (DF) for d-f transitions
can be seen in Table III. Third-order calculations es-
sentially remove such diﬀerences; the residual diﬀerences
(0.002%–0.2%) being explained by the limited number of
partial waves used in the evaluation of third-order matrix
elements.

C. Oscillator strengths, transition rates and
lifetimes

IV. MULTIPOLE MATRIX ELEMENTS,
TRANSITION RATES, AND LIFETIMES IN
TH IV

6

We calculate oscillator strengths and transition prob-
abilities for 96 possible nlj − n′l′
j′ electric-dipole tran-
sitions including the ns1/2 (n= 7-10), npj (n = 7-9),
ndj (n= 6-8), nfj (n= 5-7), and ngj (n= 5-6) states in
Fr-like thorium. Our results are presented in Table IV
and Table V. Wavelengths λ (˚A), weighted transition
rates gA (s−1), and oscillator strengths gf in Th IV are
given in Table IV. Our SD data, gA(SD) and gf (SD),
are compared with theoretical calculations, gA(HFR) and
gf (HFR), from Ref. [1]. It should be noted that experi-
mental energies are used to calculate gA(SD) and gf (SD)
as well as gA(HFR) and gf (HFR). Therefore, we really
compare the dipole matrix elements (see Table II). The
SD and HFR results for s − p and p − d transitions dis-
− 8s1/2 transition
agree by 6–25%, except for the 7p1/2
with 60% disagreement. There are also substantial dis-
agreements (factors of 2–5) between SD and HFR results
for the f − g and f − d transitions. Correlation correc-
tions are very important for those transitions as discussed
above (see Table II). The RPA and BO contributions
have the same sign opposite to the DF contributions and
the total values are half of the DF values. We see from
Table IV that for the f − g and f − d transitions the val-
ues of gA(HFR) and gf (HFR) are larger by a factor of 2–5
than the gA(SD) and gf (SD) values, respectively. On the
basis of these comparisons, it appears that correlation
corrections were not included in Ref. [1] for transitions
involving the 5fj states. Our conclusion is conﬁrmed
by comparison of gA(HFR) and gf (HFR) with our gA(DF)
and gf (DF) results (compare the Z DF and Z SD columns
in Table II). The disagreement between HFR and DF
values for transitions rates and oscillator strengths is sig-
niﬁcantly smaller (about 10–20 %) than the disagreement
between HFR and SD (by a factor of 2–5).

We calculate lifetimes of ns1/2 (n= 8-10), npj (n = 7-
9), ndj (n= 6-8), nfj (n= 6-7), and ngj (n= 5-6) states
in Fr-like thorium using the SD results for dipole matrix
elements and experimental energies [2]. We list lifetimes
τ (SD) in Table V. Unfortunately, there are no experi-
mental measurements to compare with our results; how-
ever, we hope that our calculations provide a theoreti-
cal benchmark and lifetime measurements will be carried
out.

Reduced matrix elements of the electric-quadrupole
(E2), electric-octupole (E3), and magnetic-multipole
(M1, M2, and M3) operators in lowest, second, third, and
all orders of perturbation theory are given in Table VI
for Th IV. Detailed description of the calculations of the
multipole matrix elements in lowest and second orders
of perturbation theory were given in Refs. [22, 23, 24].
Third-order and all-order calculations are done in the
same way as the calculations of the E1 matrix elements.
In Table VI, we present E2, E3, M1, M2, and M3 matrix
elements in the Z (DF), Z (DF+2), Z (DF+2+3), and Z (SD)
− 5f7/2, 5fj − 7s1/2, and
approximations for the 5f5/2
6dj − 7s1/2 transitions in Th IV.

The second-order contribution is about 1–3% for all
transitions involving the 7s1/2 states, but it is diﬀerent
−5f7/2 transition. It is very small (0.1%) for
for the 5f5/2
the M1 matrix elements and rather large (20%) for the
E2 matrix elements. The large diﬀerence between Z (DF)
and Z (DF+2+3) or Z (SD) for E2 and E3 operators could be
explained by the large size of the Brueckner orbital (BO)
correction; the ratios of Z (BO) and Z (DF) are equal to 0.06
and 0.3 for the 6dj − 7s1/2 and 5fj − 7s1/2 transitions,
respectively.

Wavelengths and transition rates A(SD) for the electric
multipole (E2 and E3) and magnetic-multipole (M1, M2,
and M3) transitions in Th IV calculated in the SD ap-
proximation are presented in Table VII. The largest con-
tribution to the lifetime of the 5f7/2 state comes from the
M1 transition. The largest contribution to the lifetime of
the 7s1/2 state comes from the E2 transitions. Our SD
result for M1 matrix elements are in perfect agreement
(0.5%) with HFR results obtained by by Bi´emont et al.
in Ref. [1]. The disagreement is much larger between
HFR and SD results for E2 transitions; 6% and 18% for
− 7s1/2 matrix elements, re-
the 6d5/2
spectively. This is expected because the correlation cor-
rection to the M1 matrix element is very small, but the
correlation correction to E2 matrix element is large, as
discussed above. Since the SD all-order method includes
the correlation corrections in a rather complete way, we
expect to see disagreements with HFR calculations in the
cases where correlation corrections are signiﬁcant.

− 7s1/2 and 6d5/2

Lifetimes for two excited levels, 7s1/2 and 5f7/2 were
not included in Table V since there are no electric-
dipole transitions from these levels. Contributions of the
electric- and magnetic-multipole transitions to the life-
time of the 7s1/2 and 5f7/2 levels are considered below.

Finally, we ﬁnd that the lifetime of the 5f7/2 state is
1.07 s and the lifetime of the 7s1/2 state is 0.590 s. An
estimate of the 7s1/2 state lifetime (about 1 s) was given
by Peik and Tamm in Ref. [25], but no measurements
have as yet been performed.

We use experimental energies from [2]. Electric-dipole
matrix elements evaluated in the the third-order and all-
order SD approximations are given in columns labeled

The breakdown of the contributions to the scalar dipole
polarizability together with ﬁnal result for the ground
state 5f5/2 in Th3+ are presented in Table IX. Again,
both third-order and all-order results are listed. We use
the same designations as in Table VIII. We also calcu-
late the polarizability αcore of the radonlike ionic core in
Th3+. Detailed discussion for the αcore in Na, K, Rb,
Cs, and Fr atomic systems was presented by Safronova
et al. in Ref. [12]. We evaluate αcore using random-phase
approximation (RPA). We ﬁnd αcore(RPA) to be equal
to 7.750 (a0)3 in a.u.. This value was used to obtain
our ﬁnal result for the scalar ground state polarizabil-
ity α0(5f5/2) = 15.1 a3

of neutral Fr, the core contribution is very large, 50%.
The calculation of the ground state polarizabilities for
Fr-like Th provides another test of the quality of atomic-
structure calculations. There are no experimental results
for the Th IV polarizabilities at this time. An accurate
measurement of the Th IV polarizability, combined with
these calculations, may be used to derive the values of
− 6d3/2 E1 matrix elements and to evaluate the
the 5f5/2
accuracy of the RPA core value.

VI. CONCLUSION

In summary, a systematic relativistic MBPT study of
energies of ns1/2 (n= 7-10), npj (n = 7-9), ndj (n= 6-8),
nfj (n= 5-7), and ngj (n= 5-6) states in Fr-like thorium
is presented. The energies are in good agreement with
existing experimental energy data and provide a theoret-
ical reference database for line identiﬁcation. A system-

− 6dj, 7s1/2

atic all-order SD study of reduced E1 matrix elements
and transition rates for the 96 electric-dipole transitions
in Th3+ is conducted. Lifetimes are calculated in the SD
approximation for nlj levels. Multipole matrix elements
− 5f7/2) are evalu-
− 5fj, and 5f5/2
(7s1/2
ated to obtain the lifetimes of the 5f7/2 and 7s1/2 states.
Scalar and tensor polarizabilities for the Th3+ ground
state are calculated using relativistic third-order and all-
order methods. We believe that our energy, lifetime, and
polarizability results will be useful in analyzing existing
experimental data and in planning future measurements.

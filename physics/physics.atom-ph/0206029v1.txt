Nanometer scale period sinusoidal atom gratings produced by a Stern-Gerlach beam
splitter

An atom interferometer based on a Stern-Gerlach beam splitter is proposed. Atom scattering
from a combination of magnetic quadrupole and homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds is considered. Using
Raman transitions, atoms are coherently excited into and de-excited from sublevels having nonzero
magnetic quantum numbers. The spatial regions in which the atoms are in such sublevels are small
and have magnetic ﬁelds designed to have constant gradients. Therefore, the atoms experience
position-independent accelerations, and the aberration of the coherently separated and recombined
atomic beams remains small. We ﬁnd that because of these properties it is possible to envision an
apparatus producing atomic density gratings with nm-scale periods and large contrasts over 10−100
µm. We use a new method of describing the atomic interaction with a pulsed spatially homogeneous
ﬁeld. In our detailed analysis, we calculate corrections caused by the non-linear part of the potential
and the ﬁnite value of the de-Broglie wave length. The chromatic aberration and the eﬀects of an
angular beam divergence are analyzed, and optimal conditions for an experimental demonstration
of the technique are identiﬁed.

I. INTRODUCTION

An important application of atom interference [1] is the
production of a periodic spatial proﬁle of the atomic den-
sity. When an atomic beam propagating along the x axis
passes through a system of counterpropagating resonant
optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ or through a microfab-
ricated structure having period λ/2 directed along the z
(transverse) axis, an initial atomic state having trans-
verse momentum p splits into a series of states having
momenta p + n¯hk, where n are integers and k = 2π/λ.
Interference between these momentum states results in
an atomic density pattern, referred to as a grating, hav-
ing a period λ/2. A detailed review and bibliography of
the diﬀerent regimes for producing atomic gratings can
be found in our recent article [2].

For the purpose of this paper, it is important to un-
derline that gratings with a sinusoidal density proﬁle and
nanometer scale period λg ≪

are of particular interest. One method to achieve this
goal is to use a large angle beam splitter (LABS), which
splits the initial atomic state into two states having mo-
menta p

inhomogeneous sinusoid with a period of order λg super-
imposed on sharp density peaks, separated by λ/2. The
undesired inhomogeneity results from the splitting of the
atomic state into two groups of momentum states rather
than into two well deﬁned momentum states.

In this article we propose a LABS based on the Stern-
Gerlach beam splitter [7,8]. Our main objective is to
test the idea of using this LABS to create sinusoidal
atomic gratings with periods much smaller than the op-
tical wavelength but with coherence lengths much larger
than the optical wavelength.

The article is arranged as follows. In the next Section,
we outline the principles of operation of the proposed
devices.
In our detailed calculations, we then consider
atomic scattering from a ﬁnite thickness layer of a linear
potential (Section III). Corrections for weak and strong
acceleration are evaluated in Sections IV and V. The ap-
pendix A is devoted to calculations of the Raman tran-
sitions between Zeeman sublevels. We summarize our
results in Sec. VI, and discuss their applicability to a
beam of 87Rb atoms.

II. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION

It was expected that triangular potentials, which one
can produce with some accuracy using a strong standing
wave ﬁeld [4], a magneto-optical scheme [5], or bichro-
matic ﬁelds [6], can work as a LABS. However, we re-
cently showed [2,3] that, asymptotically, the atom den-
sity proﬁle scattered from this LABS becomes a spatially

From a naive point of view it seems impossible to
use Stern-Gerlach beam splitters for atom interferome-
try, since such beam splitters produce inerferometer arms
corresponding to diﬀerent Zeeman sublevels. These arms
could not interfere. This problem can be avoided as fol-
lows (see Fig. 1)

FIG. 1. Principal scheme of the atom interferometer based

on the Stern-Gerlach beam-splitter.

In Fig. 1 we show the principle of the atom interfer-
ometer of interest. If an atom having angular moment
G = 1/2 is polarized along the x or y axis, then after
splitting by the Stern-Gerlach magnet I, the two arms of
the interferometer contain atoms in orthogonal but mu-
tually coherent states having Zeeman quantum numbers
1/2, respectively. Magnets II and III reﬂect the
m =
atomic beams in the two interferometer arms, and re-
combine them. Before the recombination, the internal
state in one arm of the interferometer is ﬂipped by ap-
plying an RF-induced or optically induced π-pulse in a
spatially homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. All atoms arrive
in the recombination region in the same internal state,
and interference occurs.

An ideal sinusoidal grating would arise if an incident
plane atomic wavefunction is split into two coherent com-
ponents in a spatially homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent. Evidently, a realistic Stern-Gerlach magnet, charac-
terized by a number of higher order spatial derivatives of
the magnetic ﬁeld, does not satisfy this requirement. To
realize a magnetic ﬁeld with constant ﬁeld gradient, we
consider the superposition of a homogeneous bias ﬁeld
Bs directed along z axis and a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld
produced by four (anti-)parallel currents propagating in
the
y-directions. This combination allows us to real-
ize a small volume around the center of the quadrupole
ﬁeld in which the ﬁeld gradient is approximately con-
stant, with no zero of the magnetic ﬁeld being present.
Zeroes of the magnetic ﬁeld need to be avoided in or-
der to prevent non-adiabatic spin ﬂips (Majorana tran-
sitions). Since there are no zeroes of B, an atom in a
magnetic sublevel m with respect to a quantization axis
identical to the B-ﬁeld direction adiabatically follows di-
rection changes of the B-ﬁeld along the atom’s trajectory,
and will always remain in that sublevel. The bias ﬁeld
also allowed us to generate potential with a dominant
linear term and small nonlinear corrections. The poten-
tial for the atom’s center-of-mass motion is then given
by V (r) = gµBm
. Atoms prepared in the m = 0

sublevel do not interact with the ﬁeld at all.

−

Based on the preceding considerations, we can now
outline how we realize Stern-Gerlach beam splitters with
small aberration. We assume that the above described
combination of B-ﬁelds produces a region of almost con-
stant ﬁeld gradient centered at the origin. A plane matter
wave in state m = 0 propagates in the +x-direction. The
wave is not refracted or diﬀracted by magnetic-dipole
forces while it traverses the fringe ﬁelds of the magnets.
External coupling ﬁelds are applied in a narrow plane
d, splitting the wave into a coherent su-
located at x =
perposition of two waves in diﬀerent (relevant) Zeeman
1),. The spin components of the
sublevels (e. g. m =
wave experience an acceleration
m, and acquire a dif-
ferential transverse momentum change ∆p. A second set
of coupling ﬁelds in a plane at x = +d return the ac-
celerated atoms into the state m = 0 and terminate the
interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld. As a result, the sys-
tem coherently splits an atomic plane wave entering in a
single magnetic sublevel into two momentum components
exiting in the same magnetic sublevel. aberration eﬀects,
i.e. unwanted curvatures in the phase fronts of the out-
going waves, are minimized by the fact that all magnetic
d < x < d, in
acceleration is localized to a small region
which the ﬁeld is not strongly contaminated with higher-
order multipole terms (“fringe ﬁelds”).

If the momentum states overlap spatially, an atomic
grating will form. The splitting between Zeeman sub-
levels caused by the external coupling ﬁelds determines
the momentum space distribution and the properties of
the atom grating in the detection plane. The grating
phase is determined by the diﬀerence between the atomic
wave functions phases acquired along the two arms of
the interferometer. Owing to the phase sensitivity to
the atom velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld instability, the
grating can be washed out, or one has to require that the
atomic beam and ﬁeld characteristics must be beyond
the current state-of-art. One has to choose a splitting
scheme and interferometer geometry that minimizes this
sensitivity. Two types of interferometers are shown in
Fig. 2.

are beam-splitters, whose possible layout is shown in Fig. 3.

In the triangular interferometer (Fig. 2a) atoms in

arms 1 and 2 have diﬀerent kinetic energy The phase, as-
sociated with this diﬀerence, the so called Talbot phase,
leads to periodic oscillations of the density distribution
[9], initially discovered for light [10] and also observed
in an atom interferometer [11]. The Talbot phase plays
a critical role in time-domain atom interferometry [12],
where it has been used for precise recoil frequency mea-
surements [13]. For interferometers in the spatial do-
main, the Talbot phase degrades the atom grating, and
one should prefer a symmetric interferometer (Fig. 2b)
that produces no phase diﬀerence.

To produce a symmetric interferometer one ﬁrst has
symmetrically
to split an initial atomic state
i
between, for example, states
. Co-propagating
cross-polarized optical waves can produce two-quantum
transitions between Zeeman sublevels via excited state
manifold to create ground state interferometers. Our cal-
culations show that a magnetic ﬁeld in the acceleration
zone can lead to a Zeeman splitting ωZ larger than the
inverse interaction time τi,

±

and eﬀective coupling occurs only if one superposes two
waves at frequencies Ω and Ω + ωZ needed for a two-
quantum resonances. Next, the Zeeman splitting is typ-
ically comparable with the excited state hyperﬁne split-
ting ωhf , so that, rigorously speaking, to obtain two-
quantum transition amplitudes one has to know the ex-
cited state manifold structure for a given magnetic ﬁeld.
The situation simpliﬁes if the detuning ∆ between the
waves’ frequencies and the ground-excited state transi-
tion frequency is larger than both the Zeeman and hy-
perﬁne splittings, i.e.

In this case the reduced matrix element of the two-
quantum transition is proportional to that arising in the
absence of Zeeman and hyperﬁne splittings. Since alkali
ground states have angular moment JG = 1/2, selection
rules allow ﬁeld absorption and emission processes only
where the angular moment projection changes by at most
one, and thus the two-quantum reduced matrix elements
between ground state levels vanish. As a result, a combi-
σ− ﬁelds produce no transitions. For this
nation of σ+ −
reason we assume here that the ﬁelds’ frequencies and

FIG. 3.

(a) Scheme of the beam-splitter. The beam
splitter involves four currents Iij comprising a magnetic
quadrupole, a homogeneous bias magnetic ﬁeld Bs, two
thin layers of optical ﬁelds located at x = ±d. Initially
atoms move without acceleration in the |m = 0i state.
In the ﬁrst layer, atoms split between Zeeman sublevels
|m = ±1i and start accelerating. In the second layer atoms
are partially returned to the initial state and stop ac-
celerating, while atoms in other sublevels (their trajec-
tories shown by dashed curves) leave the interferometer.

(b) Coupling of the atomic Zeeman sublevels by optical waves
propagating along the y axis inside each layer and having fre-
quencies and polarization vectors {Ω, ˆz} and {Ω + ωZ, ˆx}.

To stop the acceleration, one applies another set of
traveling waves located on a plane x = +d to return
atoms back to the
states. The x-range within

which the acceleration that split the atomic beam are
active is thereby limited to the thin region

has to distinguish the regimes of weak and strong accel-

After the action of quadrupoles I - III of Fig. 2, the
total diﬀerence of momenta in the interferometer arms is
given by

∆p = ∆pI + ∆pII .

(7)

Momentum kicks ∆pi associated with quadrupole i have
opposite signs. One needs to use ∆pII partially to cancel
∆pI . The larger
requires a larger ﬁeld and more
severe conditions for the gradient homogeneity. As a re-
sult, for a given desirable gratings period λg it is better
to choose

∆pII |

such that

∆pI | ≪ |

∆pII ≈

∆p.

In this case the role of quadrupole I is just to split the
beam into two arms, while quadrupoles II and III are
responsible almost entirely for the grating formation.

Owing to the inhomogeneity of the ﬁeld gradient, the
ﬁnite time of the interaction, and the ﬁnite angle of the
atom scattering, instead of changing the atom momen-
tum p by ﬁxed value ∆p, one produces a wave packet in
the momentum space near the momentum p + ∆p with
a width that increases for larger momentum kick ∆p (or
smaller λg). We analyzed this eﬀect recently for LABS
produced using resonant ﬁelds [2,3]. The atom grating

proﬁle would be damaged if the wave packet width be-
comes larger than ¯h/b. In this article we evaluate cor-
rections to the wave function associated with the fac-
tors listed above. For a given grating period λg, we ﬁnd
other important characteristics of the problem from the
requirement for corrections to be small. These wave func-
tion corrections allow us to choose an atomic beam aper-
ture b and velocity u, the length of the interaction zone d,
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient B′, and the bias ﬁeld strength
Bs to obtain a desired grating with a given accuracy.

The performance of the various Stern-Gerlach accel-
eration regions in the above schemes is limited by chro-
matic aberration and aberrations due to inhomogeneities
of the ﬁeld gradients. The detailed analysis presented in
the following sections provides a quantitative foundation
to estimate these eﬀects, and to identify the best possible
operating conditions.

III. ATOMIC SCATTERING FROM A LINEAR

by a potential

which acts on atoms propagating predominantly in
the x-direction. The potential acts in the narrow layer
< d, and consists of a homogeneous part U0 (x) , a

˜U1 (z, x) . In the following, we analyze the propagation of
matter waves in such a potential.

In the absence of the higher-order eﬀects described below, a purely sinusoidal grating can be formed by interfering

atomic momentum components.

matter wave.

Consider an atomic beam propagating with velocity u along the x-axis and interacting with a quadrupole magnetic

One can use Eqs. (56) to estimate the eﬃciency of the

beam splitter with arbitrary non-linearity.

We now return to the quadrupole conﬁguration at
hand. The non-linearities depend on the ratio of the
quadrupole sizes α and the relative strength of the bias
magnetic ﬁeld bs. These quantities can be used to dimin-
ish the role of the non-linearities. One can choose them
such that either the coeﬃcient c21 or the coeﬃcient c30
vanishes. Our calculations show that it is more eﬀective
to choose c21 = 0; therefore, in the remainder of this
article, we consider that case. Equation

the previously calculated correction ψq (z, τ ) , associated
with the Q-term, and, therefore, Eq. (51) are still valid.
Using the expansion (34b) one obtains a series for the op-
erator (62). Keeping only the (n, m) term of this series

The scattering of an atomic center-of-mass motion
wave packet from a narrow layer of quadrupole and
bias magnetic ﬁelds is analyzed. The combination of
these ﬁelds produces an approximately linear potential
for atoms. It was shown that for a purely linear poten-
tial, inﬁnitely small atomic de-Broglie wave length, and
time of interaction smaller than the wave packet spread-
ing time, the wave packet scatters along the classical tra-
jectory, changing its momentum by a given amount ∆p
without any wave packet deformation. Only when this
regime of scattering is realized, at least approximately,
one can expect that an interference between scattered
and recombined components of the atomic wave function
leads to a sinusoidal atomic grating of nanometer-scale
periodicity.

In this paper we calculated corrections to the atomic
wave function caused by potential non-linearities and a
small atomic de-Broglie wave length. When the grating
period λg, the quadrupole size a along the grating forma-
tion direction, the relative strength of the bias magnetic
ﬁeld bs, and the relative weight of the corrections caused
by non-linearities (ε1 and ε2) and by a ﬁnite de-Broglie
wave length (εq) are given, one can use our analysis to de-
termine the atomic beam velocity u and transverse size b,
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient B′and the bias ﬁeld strength
Bs, the thickness of the interaction layer d, and the ratio
of the quadrupole axes α that will minimize nonlinear
eﬀects.

One can consider nonlinear corrections to the wave
function as a spherical aberration of the beam splitter.
There are two more types of aberrations, namely chro-
matic aberration and the atomic beam angular diver-
gence. Chromatic aberration arises from averaging the
grating over the atomic longitudinal velocity u. Since the
atom momentum change ∆p is proportional to the time
of acceleration τ
1/u, the grating period [by Eq. (2)]
is linear in u,

∝

λg ∝

u.

(69)

To achieve a grating with a given period, one has to use
a monovelocity beam. Chromatic aberration occurs as a
consequence of a small but ﬁnite width of the velocity
distribution. To be speciﬁc, consider a Gaussian distri-
bution

where u0 is a mean velocity, σ = (u

for a beam having longitudinal temperature Θ, σ0 =

u
tribution. For a given velocity, atom interference results
in a term in the atom density,

where φtot is a total phase diﬀerence of the wave func-
tions in two arms of an interferometer. The sensitivity
of the grating to the velocity results from the velocity
dependence of φtot. Our purpose was to create phase
diﬀerence

φz = kgz

(72)

(cid:0)
where φz0 is the phase at u = u0, kg = 2π/λg is a wave
number associated with the grating period, and we take
into account Eq. (69).

(cid:1)

The largest phase that the atoms acquire is the Talbot
phase associated with the atomic kinetic energy. This
phase leads to Talbot oscillations [9] of the interference
pattern, ﬁrst observed in a Na beam [11]. Averaging over

the longitudinal velocity is equivalent to the averaging
over the Talbot phase. One has to choose an interfero-
metric scheme, in which Talbot phases can be compen-
sated. Evidently, the symmetric conﬁguration of the in-
terferometer satisﬁes this requirement. Moreover, for this
conﬁguration one compensates not only Talbot phases
acquired during the free particles propagation but also
those associated with the atoms’ acceleration inside the
beam splitters, independently of the acceleration time.

The next contribution to φtot, which we denote as φU ,
is caused by the fact that accelerated atom has slightly
diﬀerent velocity u (x) during acceleration, owing to the
homogeneous part of the potential U0 (x) [see phase fac-
tor in Eq. (14)]. Since, during acceleration in the sym-
metric conﬁguration, atoms in two arms are in substates
having opposite magnetic quantum numbers, they ac-
quire phases of the same magnitude and opposite sign.
Therefore, the grating phase is twice as large as the phase
along a given arm. For the arm 1, expanding Eq. (13) to
ﬁrst order in U0 (x) /E, one ﬁnds

φU = 2

In the case of weak acceleration, there are no other con-

ration. Owing to the large value of this phase, even for
small widths of the velocity distribution, the grating can
be washed out after averaging over velocities. To avoid
this situation, we propose to insert one more element into
the interferometer, a region of homogeneous magnetic

Leading terms here are those associated with (n, m) given by Eq. (53), for which we denote phases as φ10 and φ20.
Including only these phases, one ﬁnds that the total phase is given by

φtot = (φz0 + φU0 + φc0) (u0/u) + φ10 (u0/u)5 + φ20 (u0/u)2n2+1 .

Since new terms are not proportional to u−1, one can-
not choose a compensating phase φc0 to reduce φtot only
to the desirable phase (72), but one can choose φc0 to
oﬀset the most dangerous contribution to the aberration,
that linear in σ. Cancellation of this term occurs when

We next consider the role of the atomic beam’s angular
divergence. If the angle between the initial momentum
and the (x, y) plane is non-zero, then the atom enters
the acceleration zone at a non-zero momentum projection

lar divergence. For the weak scattering regime at pin 6
one has to shift momentum change in the deﬁnition of
phase (24b) as δp (t)
pin + δp (t) . Phases quadratic in
pin are the same for both arms of interferometer, while
the pin-independent part is analyzed above. Therefore,
we can consider only the parts linear in pin, φDi, for
(24), one ﬁnds φDi = pinzi (t) /¯h,
which, using Eqs.
where zi (t) is the atomic z-coordinate along arm i for
pin = 0 (i = 1 or 2, see Fig. 2b). Evidently φDi is a

is a force in quadrupole I. A cancellation of the Doppler
phase at the interference plane is a common property of
an atom interferometer [17]. For the quadrupole beam-
splitter, we prove that cancellation occurs for a ﬁnite
interaction time, while for optical beam splitters, involv-
ing couterpropagating waves, Eq. (81) is valid only in
the Raman-Nath approximation. Owing to the Doppler
phase cancellation, the only requirement for the weak ac-
celeration regime is that the angular divergence be less
than the scattering angle,

θb < (fI /f ) θ.

We can also estimate the width of the layers δx, in
which one excites atoms to start and to stop the accel-

celeration is not ﬁxed, and the momentum change ∆p is
spread across a range of width f δx/u. This width should
be smaller than ¯h/s, i.e.

It is not evident in advance what role the diﬀerent
types of nonlinear corrections to the atomic wave func-
tion play. This role depends on the acceleration regime,
bias ﬁeld strength, and the quadrupole geometry. One
notices, nevertheless, that all parameters of the system
depend on three variables.
Instead of ε1, ε2, εq, one
can choose any other three linearly independent parame-
ters. It is reasonable to choose variables which are most
severely restricted, and consider how large they can be

such that nonlinear corrections are still small.

For a weak acceleration regime we choose the coher-
ence length s, the layers’ thickness δx and the ratio η of
the atom displacement and the beam radius as indepen-
dent variables, given by Eqs. (43, 77, 86), respectively.
We found that for η = 0.1 and quadrupole size a = 1 cm,
nonlinear corrections do not rise above 10% if s = 40µm
and δx = 15µm. The beam and ﬁelds parameters corre-
sponding to this choice are given in Table I.

In the strong acceleration regime it makes sense to
choose a grating target period λg = 10 nm. As inde-
pendent variables, we choose the coherence half-length s,
the beam radius b, and the layer thickness δx. To achieve
large values of the parameter η and yet small weights for
the corrections we choose s = b = 3.5µm and δx = 10µm.
Data for this case are given in the second column of Table
I. A slightly better situation arises if one chooses condi-
tions, in which nonlinearities quadratic in space, second
order and fourth order in time vanish. These conditions

is illuminated by a short raman pulse, atoms are split
= 0 Zeeman sublevels and start to acceler-
between m
ate. A second, time-delayed pulse stops the acceleration,
and produces two groups of states in the m = 0 sublevel
with diﬀerent momenta. When these groups recombine
at the interference plane, a pulsed atom grating is gen-
erated. The pulsed grating can be repeated with some
repetition rate. The pulse regime will have restricted
application in lithography, because in the time intervals
between the pulses the ﬂow of atoms will continue pro-
ducing a uniform background. However, this ﬂow could
be blocked, by placing a beam stop between the two in-
terferometric arms. The great advantage of the pulsed
regime is that the time of acceleration is the same for
all atoms and, therefore, the grating period λg becomes

velocity-independent.
It allows one to relax the severe
requirements for longitudinal cooling. We will consider
the pulsed regime in more detail in a future publication.
In this article we have analyzed the role of the longitu-
dinal degrees of freedom using a perturbation theory in
the scattering angle θ. To our knowledge only two other
articles address this problem [19,20] for a ﬁnite value of θ
in an atom interferometer consisting of a set of spatially
separated, resonant traveling waves. The consideration
in [20] that assumes the edges of the ﬁeld envelopes are
shorter than an atomic de-Broglie wave length, while a
quasiclassical approach was used in [19]. Notably, we
failed to solve the relevant Schr¨odinger equation for scat-
tering from a large angle beam splitter. However, we
can stress that, when seeking sinusoidal atom gratings
of a period smaller than the optical wavelength, but still
larger than the de-Broglie wavelength, our perturbation
theory is suﬃcient. If θ
λ) the atom wave
packet will be broadened in momentum space, which
would destroy the sinusoidal shape of the atom grating
and defeat the purpose of our method.

Since we have used the operator Q above only for the evaluation of the corrections, it is suﬃcient to consider
the operator Q acting only on the unperturbed wave function Ψ0 (p0, t). For weak acceleration, when Ψ0 (p0, t) =
τ ) , one can eliminate the time-derivative in Eq. (B5). For strong acceleration, owing to the phase associated
Ψ0 (p0,
with the second term in brackets in Eq.
τ ) , the time-
derivative leads to the factor

The leading independent terms in the U1 expansion (34b) are associated with the (2, m1) and (n2, 0) elements in
Table (39). Retaining only these terms and assuming that δz (t)

Comparing this result with estimate (B3), one ﬁnds that the time-derivative can still be eliminated even for strong

From Table I in Sec. IV, one sees that all these factors are smaller than unity, except the factor η5, which is large for
the strong acceleration regime. The contribution of the order of η5 is proportional to the parameter ξ. Since parameters
ξ and c21 vanish simultaneously [compare Eqs. (38a, B2)], one can exclude in Eq. (B5) all terms containing ξ if the
aspect ratio of the quadrupole α and the relative bias ﬁeld strength bs are chosen to satisfy Eq. (57). Therefore, for
all cases under consideration, the expression (48) provides the main contribution to the correction associated with a
slowly varying amplitude approximation.

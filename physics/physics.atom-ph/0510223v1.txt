INTRODUCTION

During the last years, the precision of measurements of magnetic-dipole (M1) transitions be-

tween the ﬁne-structure levels in highly charged ions has been continuously increased [1, 2, 3,

4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Since in some cases the M1 transitions are sufﬁciently sensitive to relativistic-

correlation and quantum-electrodynamic (QED) effects, this provides good prospects for probing

their inﬂuences on atomic transition probabilities.

To date, a vast number of theoretical calculations of M1-transition probabilities between the

ﬁne-structure levels in highly charged ions has been performed (see, e.g., Refs. [9, 10, 11]). How-

ever, none of these works have provided a systematic analysis of various effects on the transition
probability. Such an analysis for the (1s22s22p) 2P1/2 −
(1s22s2p) 3P1 −

3P2 transition in Be-like ions is given in the present paper.

2P3/2 transition in B-like ions and for the

To calculate the decay rate one requires knowledge of the transition energy and the matrix ele-

ment of the transition operator. Within this work we employ experimental values of the transition

energy, which are measured accurately enough for the ions under consideration.

To analyse the inﬂuence of various effects, we decompose the transition probability W i→f into

several terms,

W i→f = W i→f

nr + ∆W i→f

D + ∆W i→f

CI + ∆W i→f

neg + ∆W i→f

QED + ∆W i→f
freq .

Here W i→f

nr

represents the nonrelativistic M1-transition probability derived employing the LS-

coupling scheme. Within the LS-coupling scheme, the amplitude of the magnetic-dipole transition

is nonzero only between the ﬁne-structure levels and depends on the quantum numbers L, S, and

J of the initial and the ﬁnal state [12]. This implies that the contribution of the interelectronic-

interaction vanishes in the nonrelativistic limit. The explicit expression for W i→f

is presented in

nr

Section II.

The relativistic correction ∆W i→f

D

is obtained by employing the one-electron Dirac wave func-

tions for the initial and the ﬁnal state. For the relativistic case the interelectronic-interaction con-

tribution is nonzero, but it is generally suppressed by a factor (αZ)2/Z. For instance, in case

of B-like Ar it amounts to about 0.1%. The interelectronic-interaction correction is, however,
rather important for the (1s22s2p) 3P1 −
1P1 are strongly mixed.

In this investigation two approaches are employed for evaluating the

3P2 transition in Be-like ions, where the terms 3P1 and

interelectronic-interaction correction. The ﬁrst one is based on the conﬁguration-interaction (CI)

2

method in the Dirac-Fock-Sturm basis, whereas the second one employs perturbation theory with

respect to 1/Z. Utilizing the CI method the relativistic Hamiltonian is speciﬁed within the no-pair

approximation [13, 14, 15]. The corresponding contribution to the M1-transition probability is
denoted by ∆W i→f

. The evaluation of this term is described in Section III.

CI

The no-pair Hamiltonian does not account for the negative-energy excitations in the many-

electron wave function. However, this effect, being dependent on the choice of the one-electron

basis, can become signiﬁcant [16, 17]. In Section IV, the contribution due to the negative-spectrum

∆W i→f
neg

is derived.

In Section V, the interelectronic-interaction correction of ﬁrst order in 1/Z is evaluated within

a rigorous QED approach employing the two-time Green function method [18]. Together with ver-
ifying the terms ∆W i→f
to ﬁrst order in 1/Z, this provides the contribution ∆W i→f
freq ,

and ∆W i→f
neg

CI

which incorporates the 1/Z interelectronic-interaction corrections of higher orders in αZ.

Finally, ∆W i→f

QED is the QED correction. The evaluation of this correction to the lowest orders

in α and αZ is described in Section VI.

The main goal of the present work is to evaluate the lifetimes of the states (2s22p) 2P3/2 in
B-like ions and (2s2p) 3P2 in Be-like ions to utmost accuracy and to investigate the inﬂuence

of various effects on the M1-transition probability. The corresponding analysis is presented in

Section VII.

Atomic units (~ = e = m = 1) are used throughout the paper.

INTERELECTRONIC INTERACTION IN THE BREIT APPROXIMATION

To evaluate the interelectronic-interaction contributions, we start with the relativistic Hamilto-

nian in the no-pair approximation,

H np = Λ+HΛ+ ,

H =

hD(i) +

V (i, j) ,

(11)

where hD(i) is the one-particle Dirac Hamiltonian and the index i = 1, . . . , N enumerates the

electrons. The Coulomb-Breit interaction operator V (i, j) = VC(i, j) + VB(i, j) is speciﬁed in

coordinate space as

approximation and gives rise to the terms of higher orders in αZ, will be considered in Section V.

occupied and vacant one-electron states. For the occupied atomic shells, the orbitals ϕn with

n = 1, . . . , M0 were obtained by the standard restricted Dirac-Fock (RDF) method, based on a

numerical solution of the radial RDF equations [21, 22]. Only the Coulomb part VC(i, j) of the

Coulomb-Breit interaction operator (12) was included in the RDF Hamiltonian hDF.

The vacant orbitals ϕn with n = M0 + 1, . . . , M were obtained by solving the Dirac-Fock-

Sturm equations

which can be considered as a generalization of the method proposed in Ref. [23] to the relativistic

Hamiltonian and to an arbitrary constant-sign weight function W (r). For every relativistic quan-

tum number κ we choose an occupied DF function ϕn0, which we call as reference DF orbital

and εn0 in (16) is the energy of this orbital. The parameter ξn in Eq. (16) can be considered as an

eigenvalue of the Sturmian operator. Obviously, for ξn = 0 the Sturmian function coincides with

the reference DF orbital ϕn0. If W (r)

0 at r

, all Sturmian functions ϕn have the same

→

→ ∞

exponential asymptotics at r

. Therefore, the all set of eigenfunctions of the Dirac-Fock-

→ ∞

Sturm operator forms a discrete set in the space of one-electron wave functions. The completeness

of this basis in the nonrelativistic limit is well-known fact. In the relativistic case this problem is

more complicated and we examined the completeness of the pure DFS basis, which we used in our

many-electron atomic calculations, numerically, reproducing exact hydrogenlike wave functions

for the same nuclear charge number Z. It should be noted that the DFS orbitals are orthogonal

with respect to the weight function W (r) and, therefore, form a linear independent basis set. The

completeness and linear independence of the combined DF and DFS basis was also examined

numerically.

In the nonrelativistic theory the widely used choice of the weight function is W (r) = 1/r,

which leads to the well-known “charge quantization”. In the relativistic case, however, this choice

is not very suitable, since the behaviour of the Sturmian wave functions at the origin differs from

that of the Dirac-Fock orbitals. In our calculations we employed the following weight function

W (r) =

which, unlike 1/r, is regular at the origin.

the joined DF and DFS basis,

where ˆF is the Dirac-Fock matrix in the joined basis of DF and DFS orbitals of a free ion. If nec-
essary, an arbitrary external ﬁeld can be included in the ˆF matrix. The matrix ˆS is nonorthogonal,

since the DFS orbitals are not orthogonal in the usual sense. The negative-energy DFS functions

were included in the total basis set as well. Eq. (19) was used to generate the whole set of orthog-

The many-electron wave function Ψ+(γJMJ ) with quantum numbers γ, J, and MJ is expanded

in terms of a large set of conﬁguration state functions (CSFs) Φα(JMJ )

Ψ+(γJMJ ) = Λ+Ψ(γJMJ ) =

The standard conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock (CIDF) method is used to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients

cα. The CSFs are constructed from the one-electron wave functions un (18) as a linear combination

of Slater determinants. The set of the CSFs is generated including all single, double, and triple

excitations into one-electron states of the positive spectrum.

IV. NEGATIVE-CONTINUUM CONTRIBUTION

can be used to ﬁnd the optimum many-electron wave function Ψopt within the variational method.

Ψ+. Therefore, one should revise the calculation of the matrix element

one-electron operator A by admixing the negative-energy spectrum excitations to Ψ+. This is es-

pecially important for so-called “odd” operators, which mix the large and small components of the

Dirac wave functions. The M1-transition operator T1 (5) is just of this kind. For this reason, the

negative-continuum contribution can be signiﬁcant and depends on the choice of the one-electron

basis set

[16, 17].

{

We consider two equivalent methods for evaluating the negative-continuum contribution to the

matrix elements of a hermitian one-electron operator A with the wave functions Ψ+. The ﬁrst

one is based on the Hellman-Feynman theorem whereas the second one employs the perturbation

theory.

The space of the wave functions used to ﬁnd Ψopt is invariant under the transformation U =

exp(iA), if A is a one-particle operator. Therefore, one can employ the Hellman-Feynman theorem

[26] to obtain the expectation value of A

V. HIGHER-ORDER INTERELECTRONIC-INTERACTION CORRECTIONS

The rigorous QED treatment of the interelectronic-interaction corrections to the transition prob-

abilities can be carried out utilizing the two-time Green function method [18]. In Ref. [27] it was

done for the 1/Z interelectronic-interaction corrections in He-like ions. Here we perform the

corresponding calculations for B-like ions. To simplify the derivation of formal expressions, we

specify the formalism regarding the core electrons as belonging to a redeﬁned vacuum (for details

we refer to Refs. [18, 28]). This leads to merging the interelectronic-interaction corrections of or-

der 1/Z with the one-loop radiative corrections. The formulas for these corrections can easily be

obtained from the corresponding expressions for the one-loop radiative corrections to the transi-

tion amplitude in a one-electron atom, derived in [18]. However, the standard electron propagator

S(ε, x, y), which enters the equations, must be replaced by

˜S(ε, x, y) = S(ε, x, y) + 2πi

where the summation runs over all occupied one-electron states refering to the closed shells. Ac-

cordingly, the total expression is represented by the sum of the pure QED and interelectronic-

interaction contributions, which correspond to the ﬁrst and second terms in the right-hand side of

Eq. (35). As a result, the 1/Z interelectronic-interaction correction to the M1-transition amplitude

in a B-like ion between the initial state a and the ﬁnal state b is

In contrast to Ref.

[18], here atomic units and the Gauss charge unit (α = e2/~c) are used.

Expression (36) incorporates the Coulomb-Breit part, which was taken into account by the CI

method, together with terms of higher order in αZ, the so-called frequency-dependent correction.

Specifying the operator I(ε) within the Coulomb gauge and setting ε = 0 in Eq. (36) yields the

Coulomb-Breit interaction. In this way we can exclude the part, which has already been taken into

account by the CI method, and obtain the frequency-dependent correction of order 1/Z as

It should be noted that the total 1/Z interelectronic-interaction correction given by equation

(36) is gauge independent. This has been conﬁrmed in our calculations to a very high accuracy.

The calculations were performed employing the B-spline method for the Dirac equation [29].

VI. QED CORRECTION

QED effects modify the transition probability via the matrix element of the transition operator

and via the transition energy. Since we employ the experimental value for the transition energy,

we have to consider the QED effect on the transition amplitude only.

The lowest-order QED correction to the M1-transition amplitude can be derived by correct-

ing the operator of the atomic magnetic moment for the anomalous magnetic moment of a free

VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The individual contributions to the M1-transition probabilities and the corresponding lifetimes

for B-like and Be-like ions are presented in Tables I and II, respectively. Due to the smallness

of the E2 transition, which is also allowed, the lifetimes are essentially determined by the M1

transition. In case of B-like ions, the experimental values of the transition energy were taken

from Ref. [30] for S11+, Cl12+, K14+, Ti17+ and from Ref. [31] for Ar13+. As one can see from

Table I the interelectronic-interaction correction ∆WCI turns out to be relatively small due to the

smallness of the factor (αZ)2/Z. The most important contributions are given by the relativistic

12

correction ∆WD and by the QED correction ∆WQED. For Be-like ions, the transition energies

were taken from Ref. [32] for S12+, Cl13+, K15+, Ti18+ and from Ref. [31] for Ar14+. In this case

the interelectronic-interaction correction ∆WCI provides an essential contribution to the total value
of the transition probability. This is due to a strong mixing of the two terms 3P1 and 1P1. Except
for Ar13+ and Ar14+, the uncertainties of the total transition probabilities are mainly determined

by the experimental uncertainties of the transition energy. For argon ions, the uncertainty comes

mainly from uncalculated higher-order QED corrections.

In Table III, our results for the lifetime of the (1s22s22p) 2P3/2 state are compared with other

calculations and with experiment.

It should be noted that the QED correction was taken into

account in Refs. [10, 37] and in the present work only. Besides, different values of the transition

energy ω, indicated in Table III, were used in the different calculations. Since the M1-transition

probability W scales as ω3, a small deviation in ω can change W signiﬁcantly. For this reason, we

recalculated the results of Cheng et al. [9] and Froese Fischer [10] for the (1s22s22p) 2P3/2 state in

B-like ions for those transition energies we have employed in our calculations. Table IV presents

these values with (τ [10]) and without (τ 0 [9]) the anomalous magnetic moment correction and

the corresponding values (τpres and τ 0
there is an excellent agreement between our “non-QED” results (τ 0

pres) obtained in this work. As one can see from the table,
pres) and those from Ref. [9]
(τ 0). There is also a good agreement between our total results (τpres) and those from Ref. [10]

(τ ). The comparison of our theoretical results with the experimental data shows generally a good

agreement as well. However, in case of Ar13+ there is a discrepancy between our 2P3/2 lifetime

value 9.538(2) ms and the most accurate experimental value 9.573(4)(5) ms [7, 8].

Table V shows a fair agreement of our results for the lifetime of the (1s22s2p) 3P2 state in

Be-like ions with corresponding results obtained by other authors and with experimental data. We

note that the QED correction has not been considered in the previous calculations cited in the table.

In conclusion, we have evaluated the magnetic-dipole transition probabilities between the ﬁne-

structure levels (1s22s22p) 2P1/2 −
ions. The relativistic, interelectronic-interaction, and radiative corrections to the transition prob-

2P3/2 for B-like ions and (1s22s2p) 3P1 −

3P2 for Be-like

ability have been considered. Except for a recent high-precision lifetime measurement on Ar13+

[7, 8] with an accuracy level on the order of 0.1%, most experimental results have large error bars

greater than 1.5% and, within these error bars, most of them are in a fair agreement with our the-

oretical predictions. In case of Ar13+, the disagreement of our prediction with the high-precision

experimental value amounts to 0.37% of the total transition probability, less than the value of the

13

corresponding QED correction. At present we have no explanation for this discrepancy.

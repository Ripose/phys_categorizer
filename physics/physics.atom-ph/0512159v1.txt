Abstract. We develop a semi-classical method to simulate the motion of atoms in a dissipative optical
lattice. Our method treats the internal states of the atom quantum mechanically, including all nonadiabatic
couplings, while position and momentum are treated as classical variables. We test our method in the one-
dimensional case. Excellent agreement with fully quantum mechanical simulations is found. Our results are
much more accurate than those of earlier semi-classical methods based on the adiabatic approximation.

1 Introduction

One of the most spectacular achievements in the ﬁeld of
laser cooling is the discovery of cooling below the Doppler
limit in optical lattices, so called Sisyphus cooling [1]. An
optical lattice is a standing wave of laser light, forming
a periodic light-shift potential for atoms moving in the
laser ﬁeld [2,3]. In the optical lattices used for cooling
the frequency of the lasers are tuned close to an atomic
resonance. The atoms thus undergo cycles of absorption
followed by spontaneous emission. Under the right exper-
imental conditions, the spontaneous emission causes an
overall loss of kinetic energy of the atoms, i.e., cooling.

Optical lattices are also widely used in Bose-Einstein
condensation experiments [4] and for quantum state ma-
nipulation [5]. These lattices are tuned far from atomic
resonances, in order to avoid spontaneous emission which
would destroy the coherence of the condensate. Therefore
these far detuned lattices do not provide any cooling.

The name Sisyphus cooling comes from the ﬁrst the-
oretical model for the process [6,7]. This model is based
on optical pumping between the magnetic sublevels of the
light shifted atomic ground state. However, at least in its
original form it relies on a number of simplifying assump-
tions, such as a semi-classical approximation, spatial av-
eraging, and a simpliﬁed level structure (a ground state
with angular momentum Jg = 1/2, and an excited state
with angular momentum Je = 3/2). Whereas this model
correctly predicts some qualitative features of cooling in
optical lattices, it is too crude to provide an overall quan-
titative agreement. Instead, a number of more advanced
theoretical methods have been developed. The most accu-
rate of these is the Monte-Carlo wavefunction technique
[8], a fully quantum mechanical method based on stochas-
tic wavefunctions.

In this paper, we develop and test a new semi-classical
method for simulating the motion of atoms in a near-
resonant optical lattice. The most important approxima-
tion of our method is that the position and momentum of
the atoms are treated as classical variables. Other approx-
imations include a classical treatment of the light ﬁeld,
and adiabatic elimination of excited states of the atoms,
but otherwise we make as few approximations as possible.
In particular, the internal states are treated quantum me-
chanically, allowing for any kind of coherent superposition
between magnetic sublevels.

Even though more exact fully quantum mechanical
theoretical methods exist, semi-classical methods are valu-
able, partly because they are less demanding numerically,
but also because they provide a simpler conceptual frame-
work in which it is easier to formulate an intuitive picture
of e.g. the mechanisms involved in the cooling process. Up
to now, all semi-classical methods for laser cooling in op-
tical lattices have been based on atoms that are pumped
between deﬁnite internal states as they move through the
lattice. To this end a basis of so-called adiabatic states, di-
agonalizing the light-shift potential at every position, has
been used instead of the diabatic basis of the magnetic
substates [9]. Coherences between adiabatic states have
not been included in the description, and neither have
so-called nonadiabatic couplings arising from the position
dependence of the adiabatic basis. Thus, the motion of
the atoms is described by purely classical equations, al-
beit the various potentials, pumping rates and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients have been derived from a quantum-mechanical
origin. These adiabatic semi-classical methods reproduce
some of the qualitative features of Sisyphus cooling, e.g. a
linear relation between temperature and irradiance at high
irradiances [10]. However, we show that even at very high
irradiances the slope of this linear dependence does not
agree with fully quantum-mechanical simulations. At the

2

lower irradiances relevant to most experiments the adia-
batic semi-classical method deviates even more severely
from the fully quantum-mechanical results. Both these
problems are solved by the nonadiabatic semi-classical ap-
proach.

2 Theory

In this section we develop the basic semi-classical equa-
tions of motion, on which our simulations are based. For
generality the theory is developed in three dimensions.
The angular momenta of the ground and excited states
of the lattice transition are denoted by Jg and Je respec-
tively, and the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers
are Mg and Me. Although the derivation is more general,
we shall in the end apply the theory to the case Je = Jg+1.
Also, the light ﬁeld ξ(r) creating the lattice could take
diﬀerent forms, but will in the end be assumed to have a
lin
lin conﬁguration in one, two or three dimensions [3].
That is, the lattice is created by the interference pattern of
light ﬁelds, forming lattice sites with alternating σ+ and
σ− polarizations.

⊥

We start from the optical Bloch equations for an atom
in a standing wave laser ﬁeld [11]. They can be derived
under very general conditions, and represent for practical
purposes an exact fully quantum mechanical description
of atomic motion in an optical lattice. Our ﬁrst important
approximation is that the population of the excited state
is suﬃciently low to allow its adiabatic elimination. The
condition for this is that the saturation parameter

Ω2/2

s0 =

∆2 + Γ 2/4 ≪

1.

(1)

Here ∆ is the detuning from resonance, Γ the natural
width of the excited state, and Ω is the Rabi frequency1.
The details of the adiabatic elimination of the excited
states can be found e.g. in Ref. [11]. This approximation
is an important simpliﬁcation, since it reduces the master
equation for the full density matrix, to an equation for the
(2Jg + 1)
(2Jg + 1) density matrix σ of the ground states.
The resulting equation for the evolution of σ reads

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of this equation rep-
resents the Hamiltonian part of the evolution. The second
term represents the non-Hermitian evolution due to spon-
taneous emission. The Hamiltonian contains the kinetic
term and the light-shift potential,

1 We use the Rabi frequency based on the total laser ﬁeld.
This is the same convention as was used, e.g., in Ref. [9]. Some-
times the Rabi frequency is instead on the laser irradiance per
beam, which for a one-dimensional lin⊥lin conﬁguration is half
the total irradiance.

In the basis of the magnetic substates Mg the operator
ˆA(r) is represented a matrix A(r).

For the simple model atom with Jg = 1/2 and Je = 3/2
A(r) is a diagonal matrix. However, most atoms of interest
have a more complicated level structure, including non-
diagonal couplings in the potential. Therefore previous
semi-classical methods have used an adiabatic basis, where
the atomic states are the eigenstates of A(r). Whereas
A(r) is diagonal in the adiabatic basis, the position de-
pendence of the basis gives rise to nonadiabatic couplings
between adiabatic states. In the adiabatic approximation
these couplings are neglected. In our method we keep all
oﬀ-diagonal couplings. The results are then independent
of the basis used, and the simplest choice is to stay with
the magnetic levels Mg, the diabatic basis. Since this basis
is the same for all r, all couplings are included in A(r),
and their functional form can be calculated analytically
for a given laser conﬁguration.

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2)
contains processes associated with spontaneous emission.

Our goal is to approximate Eq. (2) by a semi-classical
equation where every atom has a deﬁnite position and
momentum, i.e. every atom follows a trajectory in phase
space. This is of course not allowed in quantum mechanics,
because of the uncertainty principle. Hence, a quantum
mechanical phase space cannot be deﬁned, but it is still
possible to introduce a “coarse grained” version of phase
space through the Wigner function

No approximation has been made in going from Eq.
(2) to Eq. (10), the Wigner transformation is just another
representation of the same physics. Now, we introduce the
semi-classical approximation. According to this approxi-
mation the momentum distribution varies smoothly and
slowly over typical momentum transfers q in Eq. (10).
Since A(r) and Bǫ(r) have the same periodicity as the
laser ﬁeld, i.e. λ = 2π/kR, Eqs. (11) and (12) show that the
typical size for q is the recoil momentum. Thus, the semi-
classical approximation assumes that the momentum dis-
tribution changes little for emission/absorption of a single
photon. As long as the atomic momenta are several recoil
units large, and the eﬀects of quantization of the atomic
states are small, this approximation can be expected to
work well.

Invoking the semi-classical approximation we can make
a second-order Taylor expansion around p of the Wigner

distribution

Using this expansion it is possible to replace ˜A and ˜Bǫ by
their counterparts in position space. The resulting equa-

be interpreted as a phase-space distribution, is

to give physical interpretations to its terms. The left hand

any derivative represent transfer of population between
states, either by couplings from non-diagonal terms of the
light-shift potential ∆′A(r), or by optical pumping. The
terms containing ∂pi W (r, p, t) describe the motion of the
atoms due to forces from light-shift potential and the ra-
diation pressure. Terms containing second derivatives of
both W (r, p, t) and ﬁrst or second derivatives of A(r)
or Bǫ(r) describe the momentum diﬀusion due to ﬂuc-
tuations in the number of photons absorbed. Finally, the
term containing ∂2
pi W (r, p, t), but no other derivatives,
contains the momentum diﬀusion due to the recoil kick
from spontaneously emitted photons.

Equation (14) is the most complete semi-classical ap-
proximation for the time-dependent distributions of atoms
in r and p space. It is classical in the sense that the
atoms are assumed to be particles with deﬁnite positions
and momenta. The internal states, however, are treated
fully quantum mechanically, including all oﬀ-diagonal cou-
plings and coherences. It is thus not possible to assign an
atom to a deﬁnite internal state, nor is it described as a
classical probability distribution over the diﬀerent inter-
nal states, but as a quantum-mechanical superposition of
internal states.

In order to solve Eq. (14) we recast it into a Langevin-
type equation. That is, instead of calculating distributions
of atoms, we shall calculate phase-space trajectories ˜x(t)
and ˜p(t) of individual atoms. In doing this, we still want to
keep the quantum mechanical description of the internal
states. That is, the probability distribution of an atom is

W (r, p, t) = w(t)δ (r

˜r(t)) δ (p

˜p(t)) .

(16)

Here w(t) is a matrix of dimension 2Jg + 1 containing
the internal-state density matrix of the atom at time t.
Inserting this form into Eq. (14), and integrating over po-
sition and momentum, the evolution equation for w(t) is
obtained

Here and below, we use the simpliﬁed notation r for ˜r(t)
and p for ˜p(t). It is, however, important to understand
that these are now time-dependent functions represent-
ing position and momentum of a single atom, which are
conceptually very diﬀerent from the variables in Eq. (14).

The latter term is in general anisotropic.

3 Numerical implementation

We simulate the equations (17), (18) and (19) in one di-
mension. The laser ﬁeld has the form

ξ(z) = cos(kRz)ε−1 −

i sin(kRz)ε+1.

(23)

At the start of every time step the system is in a pure
quantum mechanical state. For every time step w,z, and
p are evolved using a second-order Runge-Kutta method.
The ﬂuctuating force χ(t) is included as a term

r√2D dt,

(24)

where r is a random number with zero average and unit
variance. This term only needs to be evaluated once every
time step [13].

At the end of a time step, the system will not be in
a pure state anymore. Its internal-state density matrix w
can, however, be decomposed into 2Jg + 1 pure states

in the sense that it is the only one into a set of linearly
independent pure states.

For numerical eﬃciency the eigenvalues were obtained
using ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, which is suﬃciently
exact if dt is short enough. In practice, one of the eigenval-
ues will be very close to one, while the others are small or
zero. Thus, one can interpret the system as either staying
in the same state, or jumping to a new state. When the
eigenvalues obtained by perturbation theory indicate that
the system makes a jump, the accuracy is increased by a
full diagonalization of w. The expense in computer time
for this improvement is modest, since jumps are compar-
atively rare.

In our simulations we used the parameters for the D2 line
in cesium, i.e. Jg = 4, Je = 5, and natural width Γ/2π =
10−30 J
5.2227 MHz, and recoil energy ER = 1.3692
[15]. The diagonal elements of the diabatic potential for
this transition are displayed in Figure 1. We ﬁrst investi-
gated the steady-state momentum distributions. For po-
tential depths ~
200ER the samples contained 5000
atoms, and were iterated for the time 2500/Γ ′. To im-
prove statistics the momentum distribution was averaged
over the last 1000/Γ ′ of the evolution time. For low poten-
tial depths convergence is slower. Therefore we used 20000
atoms for ~∆′ < 200ER, and the evolution time 5000/Γ ′,
with averaging over the last 2000/Γ ′. For all runs the time
step was dt = 0.025/Γ ′, and the initial state a spatially
uniform distribution with temperature of 10 µK.

results are compared to a full-quantum simulation using
the Monte-Carlo wave function method [8]. The two meth-
ods are in excellent agreement. The relative diﬀerence is
at most about 20%. It is not clear how much of this de-
viation can be attributed to the fundamental diﬀerence
between the two methods, and how much is due to e.g. sta-
tistical uncertainties or other numerical errors. For deep
potentials both methods give the same linear slope, al-
though with a slight oﬀset. The agreement continues all
the way down through d´ecrochage, i.e. the point where the
curve turns around and starts to increase again for small
potential depths, although statistical ﬂuctuations in the
full-quantum data make comparisons more diﬃcult here.
It also evident from Figure 2 that the present method
is a substantial improvement of the adiabatic method used
in Ref. [9]. The methods do not even agree at large po-
tential depths, where one would expect the nonadiabatic
corrections to become small. Improving upon this method
by including non-diagonal diﬀusion terms (for details see
Ref. [9]) does not substantially change the situation. We
note that even in the limit of vanishing nonadiabatic cor-
rections our method diﬀers from that in Ref. [9] by al-
lowing for coherences between the internal states. In the
adiabatic basis the potential does not induce any coher-
ences between internal states, but such coherences are still
induced by optical pumping.

quantum results (squares). For comparison we also show results
based on the adiabatic approximation calculated similarly to
the method used in Ref. [9] (crosses), and the same method
improved by including also non-diagonal diﬀusion coeﬃcients
(triangles). The detuning is ∆ = −10Γ .

The semi-classical method also makes it possible to fol-
low the motion of a single atom as it moves through the
lattice. In Figures 3 and 4 we show the position, momen-
tum, energy and internal state distribution as a function
of time for a single atom in optical lattices with detun-
= 150ER and
ings ∆ =
~
= 1000ER respectively. The energy was calculated
as the sum of the kinetic energy and light-shift potential,

10Γ , and potential depths ~

The ratio between the potential, pumping and diﬀu-
sion terms in Eq. (14) depends on ∆/Γ only, and is hence
the same in both graphs. The only diﬀerence lies in the in-
ertial term p/m∂i. Increasing
, while keeping the ratio
|
∆/Γ constant, is equivalent to increasing the mass m by
the same factor. This can be seen comparing the graphs,
since the atom is less mobile in Figure 4.

At both potential depths the atom shows, after an ini-
tial cooling phase, a high degree of localization. While lo-
calized the atom populates mostly the extreme magnetic
states Mg =
Jg. The energy is more or less constant,
ﬂuctuating around half the potential depth. The ampli-
tudes of the oscillations in momentum and position vary
somewhat due to diﬀusion, but tend to stay within certain
bounds as long as the atom remains in the same poten-
tial well. We cannot see any clear trend towards smaller

±

oscillation amplitudes while the atom remains trapped in
a site, i.e., we see no local cooling.

The periods of localization are interrupted by brief
phases where the atom acquires enough energy to travel
over many potential wells, before once again getting lo-
calized. These excursions are most prominent at lower po-
tential depths. The periods when the atom is untrapped
are associated with abrupt changes of the internal state of
the atom, usually from odd to even magnetic states. (The
light-shift potential only induces odd–odd and even–even
couplings between magnetic states. Thus any pure quan-
tum mechanical state is a superposition of only odd or only
even magnetic states.) During all periods of localization
the atom is in a state with similar internal-state distribu-
tion and energy. Even when the energy sometimes drops
below this stationary value the atom is soon returned to
the same state.

These results are in qualitative agreement with our
earlier conclusion that Sisyphus cooling, especially at low
potential depths, works through a transfer of atoms be-
tween a hot and a cold mode [16]. The cold mode has
a momentum distribution, with a width that does not
change over time. This mode corresponds to the popu-

lation of atoms in the trapped state. The cooling process
is in eﬀect a transfer of atoms from the untrapped to the
trapped state.

In Fig. 5 we compare the semi-classical approxima-
tion to the time evolution of the momentum distribu-
tion D(p) = dN (p)/dp (where N (p) is the number of
atoms with momentum p) to the results in [16], for
=
130ER. The bimodality of the distribution is very clear
also in the semi-classical results, and the agreement with
the quantum-mechanical results is very good. The distri-
bution of the hot mode is identical to within statistical
uncertainties. This shows that the physics of untrapped
atoms, including their rate of transfer to trapped states,
is well described by our semi-classical method. The semi-
classical method gives a slightly more narrow cold mode,
in agreement with the results in Fig. 2.

Such eﬀects will be most prominent when the atoms are
localized near the bottom of the potential wells. Another
is the coherent splitting of a wave packet. If the atomic
wavefunction is, e.g., partially transmitted to the next po-
tential well, the semi-classical method will describe this as
a classical probability (some atoms are transmitted, some
are not), while any coherence eﬀects between the two parts
of the wave packet will be lost.

The conceptual simplicity of the semi-classical descrip-
tions makes it a useful aid in visualizing complex physical
processes. It is also a ﬂexible tool, which is relatively easy
to adapt to diﬀerent physical situations. In the near future
we plan to extend the method to double optical lattices
[17]. Further studies of the cooling process, e.g. to deepen
the understanding of the bimodal velocity distributions
observed in experiment and full quantum simulations, are
underway.

5 Discussion

We have developed a semi-classical method to simulate the
dynamics of atoms in optical lattices. Our results for the
average momentum distribution of the atoms, including
its time dependence, agree excellently with those of the
fully quantum mechanical method. To achieve an accurate
description it is necessary to include both populations of
and coherences between the internal states of the atom.
The external degrees of freedom may, at least in some
situations, be described classically, i.e., as particles with
deﬁnite positions and momenta.

The semi-classical approximation was introduced as a
second order Taylor expansion in p/pR of the Wigner func-
irms & 4pR, and hence this
tion. According to our results
p
h
expansion should be a fairly good approximation. Never-
theless, there are some situations where the semi-classical
description must necessarily break down. One is when ef-
fects from the quantization of bound states are important.

We thank Robin Kaiser for useful discussions. This work

the calculations were performed using the resources of the
High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N).

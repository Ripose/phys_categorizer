For a system with three identical atoms, the dependence of the s−wave virtual state energy on
the weakly bound dimer and trimer binding energies is calculated in a form of a universal scaling
function. The scaling function is obtained from a renormalizable three-body model with a pairwise
Dirac-delta interaction.
It was also discussed the threshold condition for the appearance of the
trimer virtual state.

I. INTRODUCTION

Weakly bound three-body zero-angular momentum states appear in a three boson system, with the number of
states growing to inﬁnity, condensing at zero energy as the pair interactions are just about to bind two particles in
s
wave. These three-body states are known as Eﬁmov states [1,2]. Their wave functions, loosely bound, extend far
−
beyond those of normal states and dominate the low-energy scattering phenomena in these systems. The Eﬁmov
states have been studied in a number of model calculations [3,4,5], in atomic and nuclear systems, without yet a clear
experimental signature of their occurrence [2,6,7,8,9,10].

Actually, the search of Eﬁmov states in atomic systems is becoming more appealing, due to the experimental
realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [11], and due to the possibility of altering the eﬀective scattering
length of the low-energy atom-atom interaction in the trap, from large negative to large positive values crossing the
dimer zero binding energy value, by using an external magnetic ﬁeld [12]. This possibility of changing the two-body
scattering length to large values, as recently shown in Ref. [13], can alter in an essential way the balance between the
non-linear ﬁrst few terms of the mean-ﬁeld description presented in the equations that model Bose-Einstein condensed
gases [14]. This can certainly open new perspectives for theoretical and experimental investigations related to the
many-body behavior of condensate systems. Even in systems where the occurrence of an excited bound Eﬁmov state
has shown to be doubtful or even not possible, as for example, in the case of halo nuclei like 20C or 18C (seen as a
core with a halo of two neutrons) [8], one can verify the occurrence of three-body virtual states. The physics of these
three-body systems is related to the unusually large size of the wave-function compared to the range of the potential.
Thus, the detailed form of the short-ranged potential is not important for the three-body observables [15], which gives
to the system universal properties, deﬁned by few physical scales [8]. Strictly speaking, in the limit of a zero-range
interaction the three-body system is parametrized by the physical two- and three-body scales, which are identiﬁed
with the two-body scattering lengths and one three-body binding energy [9,16]. The physical reason for the sensibility
of the three-body binding energy to the interaction properties comes from the collapse of the system in the limit of a
zero-range force, which is known as the Thomas eﬀect [17].

In the present work, we analyze the possibility that an excited trimer state becomes a virtual state, when the
physical scales of the system are changed. This is expected to occur, for example, near the limit when the two-body
scattering length goes from large positive to large negative value: the corresponding two-body energy is close to zero
and goes from a bound to a virtual state, with appearance of many bound and virtual three-body states. The three-
body virtual state energy is a pole of the S-matrix in the second sheet of the complex energy plane. In a general case,
as the strength of the two-body potential diminishes, the pole moves towards the ﬁrst energy sheet to become a bound
state [5]. More recently, this behavior of the Eﬁmov state going to a virtual state with the increase of the strength of
the interaction, has been conﬁrmed in realistic calculation of the helium trimer [18]. Here, we study a new physical
it appears when the ratio between the
aspect of the emergence of the s
dimer and trimer binding energies grows. This approach goes beyond a previous analysis of excited three-body bound
states with short-range interactions, that was performed in Ref. [9]. In Ref. [9], a scaling function was introduced
to analyze the behavior of bound Eﬁmov states when modifying the triatomic physical scales. Essentially, we are

wave virtual state from an Eﬁmov state:

extending to the second sheet of the complex energy plane (to include virtual trimer states) a previous investigation
on a universal scaling mechanism that was applied to two and three-body bound states [9,10]. The extension of the
scaling function to the second energy sheet is performed by following the Eﬁmov states as they move from bound
to virtual, accordingly to the variation of the ratio of the dimer to trimer bound state energies. On the other hand,
as we present the discussion through a universal scaling mechanism with the results in dimensionless units, all the
conclusions apply equally to any low-energy three-boson system. For the regularization and renormalization of the
zero-range model, we compare two diﬀerent approaches: by using a momentum cutoﬀ parameter [9] and via kernel
subtraction [16,19,20]. As the two-body energy goes to zero (or equivalently the regularization parameter goes to
inﬁnity), we conclude that the results of both methods do not diﬀer.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we generalize the scaling function deﬁned in Ref. [9] to include
virtual trimer states. In this section, we also revise the connection between the Thomas and Eﬁmov eﬀects, while
introducing our notation and the homogeneous integral equation for the Faddeev component of the vertex of the
wave-function for zero-range potential. In section III we present our main numerical results. In the ﬁrst subsection,
we present the subtracted homogeneous Faddeev equation that we have used for determining the trimer bound and
virtual states and we brieﬂy explain how the renormalization method of Refs. [19,20] implies in the subtracted three-
body equation ﬁrst formulated in Ref. [16]. In the next subsection, we present our new numerical results for the virtual
state energies, including the bound-state previous results and we compare, as well, the results obtained by using the
sharp-cutoﬀ and the subtraction scheme. Comparison with other calculations are also discussed. Our conclusions are
summarized in section IV.

II. THOMAS-EFIMOV EFFECT AND THE GENERALIZED SCALING FUNCTION

In this section, we introduce the generalization of the scaling function deﬁned in Ref. [9], to be used in the second
energy sheet of the trimer energy. In order to become clear this extension, and to deﬁne our notation, we begin by
revising the main ﬁndings of Refs. [9,21].

The three-boson system for ℓ = 0 in three dimensions collapses when r0 →

0 with a ﬁxed two-body scale, which
is known as Thomas eﬀect [17]. Thus, the three-body system has a characteristic physical scale independent of the
two-body ones [16]. In one and two space dimensions the collapse is absent [15]. In the limit when the binding energy
of the two-boson system goes to zero, the three-boson system has an inﬁnite number of bound Eﬁmov states [1]
condensing at zero-energy. The Thomas and Eﬁmov eﬀects were shown to be physically equivalent [21], since in both
cases the ratio between the interaction range and the two-body scattering length goes to zero.

The integral equation for the Faddeev components, φ, of the three boson bound state vertex, for ℓ = 0, with the

0 , due to the Thomas collapse. According
to Ref. [21], using units of Λ = 1, we rescale the momentum variables and the two and three-body binding energies,
respectively, such that ~p = Λ~x, ~q = Λ~y, E2 = Λ2ǫ2, and E3 = Λ2ǫ3. In this dimensionless variables, after redeﬁning φ

The number of three-body bound states, given by the values of ǫ3 that satisﬁes Eq. (1), grows without limit when
ǫ2 decreases to zero: ǫ3 = ǫ(N )
(N = 0, 1, 2...), with ǫ(N )
500 [1]. They are the energies of the Eﬁmov
states, in units of Λ = 1. But, the limit of ǫ2 going to zero, can be realized either by E2 →

We would like to add one more comment to this section. The existence of a three-body scale implies in the low

limit, one has

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR VIRTUAL AND BOUND TRIMERS

In this section we present our main results for the trimer bound and virtual states. With the sake to be complete,

we ﬁrst brieﬂy sketch a new derivation of the subtracted equations that were numerically solved.

interaction, is given by:

which is written in units such that the three-body subtraction energy is µ2
a diﬀerent regulator, that expresses the physical condition at the subtraction point.

We brieﬂy explain below the main physical steps to derive the three-body renormalized equation [16] used in our
numerical calculation of the scaling functions through Eq.(6) for the bound state and its analytic continuation to the
second energy sheet for the virtual state. We begin from the general Lippman-Schwinger equation expressed in a

µ2
(3) it is assumed that the three-body multiple
by the sum of the pairwise two-body T-matrices. Thus, at the energy
scattering series vanishes beyond the driving term. Observe that this is not true for a regular ﬁnite range potential,
only in the limit of µ(3) → ∞
. However, in the scaling limit, in fact the actual value of µ(3) tends to inﬁnity such that
E2/µ2

to the relative coordinate of the particle k to the center of mass of the pair (ij), and mk(ij) is the reduced mass.

Using Eqs. (7) and (10) and after some straightforward manipulations, the equations for the Faddeev components of
the T-matrix at the bound state pole give Eq.(6), which has a natural momentum scale given by µ(3). In principle µ(3)
can be varied without changing the content of the theory as long as the three-body T-matrix at the new subtraction-
µ2
energy
(3) is found from the solution of Eq. (9) with the boundary condition Eq.(10), and consequently Eq.(6)
should be conveniently rewritten. In the scaling limit, Eq.(1) and Eq.(6) produce the same results (as we are going to
illustrate numerically), since they are solved for ǫ2 going to zero, and the detailed form of the regularization implied
in both equations is not important anymore. However, Eq.(6), has conceptual and practical advantages over Eq.(1),
namely it is explicitly renormalization group invariant and it is as well regularized.

To simplify the notation of Eq. (6), we introduce another deﬁnition related to the two-body energy: κ2 ≡ ±

For ℓ > 0, the original Skornyakov and Ter-Martirosian equation [25] is well deﬁned and the three-body observables are
completely determined by the two-body physical scale corresponding to E2. One ﬁnds examples of the disappearance

The analytic continuation to the second energy sheet, of the scattering equations for separable potentials, is discussed
in detail by Gl¨ockle, in Ref. [26]. In the particular case of the zero-range three-body model [25], it is also given in
Ref. [29]. On the second energy sheet, the integral equations are obtained by the analytical continuation through the
two-body elastic scattering cut corresponding to the atom-dimer scattering. The elastic scattering cut comes through
the pole of the atom-atom elastic scattering amplitude in Eq.(12). We perform the analytic continuation of Eq. (11)

It is usual to analyze how the Eﬁmov states arise by varying the strength of the interaction to change the value of
the two-body binding energy. In our case, instead of this procedure, we change directly the value of the energies in
units of µ = 1 and by doing this we calculate the s
wave three-body energy evolution in the complex energy plane,
corresponding to the bound and virtual triatomic states from Eqs. (11) and (14), respectively. As ǫ2 goes to zero a
crescent number of weakly bound (in units of µ = 1) Eﬁmov states appear. The Thomas-Eﬁmov limit for ǫ2 going to
zero is clearly seen in Fig. 2, where we plot ǫ(N )
as a function of ǫ2. In this ﬁgure we display only the energies of the
ﬁrst three states. The main purpose of Fig. 2 is to show the real nature of the energies of the Thomas-Eﬁmov states.
The small circles and triangles correspond, respectively, to the ﬁrst and second excited virtual state energies, which
begin at the cut from the one-particle exchange mechanism that gives ǫ3v = (4/3)ǫ2 (shown in the ﬁgure by the dotted
line). The threshold, from which the virtual three-body states arise, are exhibited by down-arrows (
). When the
↓
two-body energy is enough for a trimer bound state to exist, then a decrease in ǫ2 allows the virtual state to appear
from the one-particle-exchange cut. Further decrease in ǫ2 favors the appearance of the excited state, which emerges
from the second energy sheet to the ﬁrst one at the threshold value ǫ3 = ǫ2, (solid line), indicated by the up-arrow
)1/2 = 0.38 where the excited state is labeled by N + 1, and
(

in the ﬁgure is indicated by the up-arrow. This ﬁgure also strongly suggests that the Thomas-Eﬁmov states cannot
be completely understood only through the absolute value of E2 itself, because the critical value for the appearance
of the (N + 1)-excited state depends only on the ratio E2/E(N )
, which is independent of the absolute scale.
Therefore, to show that this argument is universal, we study the function E(N +1)
/ǫ2 as a function of
E2/E(N )

The plot of Fig. 3 is constructed with the results for the ﬁrst and second Thomas-Eﬁmov states. This plot
practically coincides with the corresponding one obtained from the second and third states (not shown). Figure 3
shows a universal route for the energy of the (N + 1) trimer state in the complex energy plane, from the second energy
sheet to the ﬁrst one as the ratio E2/E(N )

there is not yet, to our knowledge realistic calculations of the virtual state in helium trimer or even in any other weakly
bound three-boson system, in which our route should also applies. We emphasize that although we have presented
results only for the second and third Thomas-Eﬁmov states, the scaling limit is practically approached as we see in
Fig. 3. We expect that going further in diminishing the absolute value of E2 the new excited states will also follow
the same route. The claim is of course that the route is universal for all states in the scaling limit.

virtual state energies are shown by the dotted curves. Our calculations show that the results for N = 0 and N = 1 practically
coincide. The symbols represent results from other calculations: empty squares (s−wave) and empty circles (s + d waves) are
from Ref. [30] (for N = 0); crossed squares, from Ref. [31]; the crossed circle is from Ref. [32]; the triangle, from Ref. [33]; and

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Natural scales determine the physics of quantum few-body systems with short-range interactions. The physical
scales of three interacting particles, in the state of zero total angular momentum, are identiﬁed with the bound or
virtual subsystems energy and the ground state three-body binding energy. The scaling limit is found when the ratio
between the scattering length and the interaction range tends to inﬁnity, while the ratio between the physical scales
are kept ﬁxed. This deﬁnes a scaling function for a given observable. From the formal point of view, we showed
the relation of the scaling limit and the renormalization aspects of a few-body model with a zero-range interaction,
through the derivation of subtracted three-body T-matrix equations, which are renormalization group invariant.

In the present work, we investigate the behavior of an excited Thomas-Eﬁmov state as the binding energy of the
subsystem increases with respect to the energy of the next lower bound three-body state. As shown, by allowing the
two-body binding energy to increase in respect to the three-particle ground state energy, the excited three-body state
disappears and a corresponding three-body virtual state emerges. The threshold for the three-body virtual state was
found to be at the energy of the weakly bound trimer equal to 6.9 ¯h2/(ma2) for large positive scattering lengths
(a). The dependence of the s
wave virtual state three-body energy on the two and three atom ground state binding
energies is calculated in the limit of a zero-range potential in a form of an universal scaling function. The scaling plots
are an useful tool to classify observables and provide ﬁrst guess to guide realistic calculations, as well as for planning
experiments, with the aim of looking for weakly bound excited state of triatomic molecules.

The results of the present study can also be particularly relevant to the interpretation of experiments in atomic
condensation, in which the eﬀective atom-atom scattering length can be altered from negative to positive, in a wide
range of values crossing zero-energy bound dimer [12]. For large positive scattering lengths, our estimate gives the
threshold for the zero-binding trimer state, which allows to settle the experimental conditions for an investigation of
the Eﬁmov eﬀect and search for their inﬂuence on the observables of condensed systems. On the other hand, large
negative two-body scattering length have been recently investigated in Ref. [13]. There is the possibility that the
observed discrepancy related with previous theoretical predictions can have their explanations in three-body eﬀects,
as well, because large two-body scattering lengths give the conditions where three-body (bound or virtual) Eﬁmov
states are likely to occur.

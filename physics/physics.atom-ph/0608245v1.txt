Abstract. The closed form integral representation for the projection onto the
subspace spanned by bound states of the two-body Coulomb Hamiltonian is obtained.
The projection operator onto the n2 dimensional subspace corresponding to the n-th
eigenvalue in the Coulomb discrete spectrum is also represented as the combination of
Laguerre polynomials of n-th and (n
1)-th order. The latter allows us to derive an
analog of the Christoﬀel-Darboux summation formula for the Laguerre polynomials.
The representations obtained are believed to be helpful in solving the breakup problem
in a system of three charged particles where the correct treatment of inﬁnitely many
bound states in two body subsystems is one of the most diﬃcult technical problems.

Closed form representation for a projection onto Coulomb bound states

1. Introduction

The two-body Coulomb problem is perhaps the most famous problem of quantum
mechanics formulated on the basis of the Schr¨odinger wave equation [1]. First solved
analytically for the bound states [1], it was then solved for scattering states [2], as
well as for the Green’s function [3], [4], [5]. The situation is quite diﬀerent for the
systems involving three and more charged particles. There is no analytic solution to the
Schr¨odinger equation in this case and the problem exhibits a great complexity especially
if the ionization process is energetically permitted. In this case, the inﬁnitely many open
excitation channels are lead to extremely complicated behavior of the wave function,
which asymptotically possesses inﬁnitely many terms. Although deﬁnite progress has
been made in the practical numerical solution of the three charged particles problem
above the disintegration threshold [6] by methods avoiding the explicit use of the wave
function asymptotics, the theoretical status of the few-body Coulomb problem is still
unsatisfactory in many respects. Among the very extensive literature devoted to the
few-body Coulomb problem, the following works [7], [8] and [9] refer to the theoretical
aspects of the problem.

Recently we have presented a new method of handling the Coulomb potentials in the
few-body Hamiltonian with the help of the Coulomb-Fourier transform (CFT) [10]. The
method allows us to exclude the long-range Coulomb interaction from the Hamiltonian
by a specially constructed unitary transformation. This method was proven useful for
In the case of attraction, the analytic closed form

representation for the projections onto the Coulomb bound-states subspace may lead to
a substantial simpliﬁcation of the CFT method machinery. Although the latter was the
primary goal, it was found that the representations obtained, being quite general, are
not well addressed in the literature, and this has stimulated this publication.

The paper is organized from three sections. After the introduction, in the section
two we derive representations for projection operators and consider some particular
cases. The third section concludes the paper. Throughout the paper the bold letters,
e.g. r, r′, are used for vectors and not bold for their magnitudes, e.g. r =
. The unit
vector associated with r will be denoted by ˆr = r/r.

3. Conclusion

The closed form representations are obtained for projections onto the n2-dimensional
subspace spanned by bound-state eigenfunctions of
the Coulomb Hamiltonian
corresponding to the principal quantum number n as well as for the projection onto the
subspace spanned by all Coulomb bound-states. These representations can be useful for
solving the few body scattering problem in a system of charged particles for energies
above the three body disintegration thresholds. The asymptotics computed above for
may lead to drastic simpliﬁcations in calculating diﬀerent
the projections
Coulomb matrix elements between states which are spatially well conﬁned. The analog
of the Christoﬀel-Darboux summation formula for Laguerre polynomials which is derived
as a particular case of the representations for the Coulomb projections can be useful for
the theory of classical orthogonal polynomials.

Abstract

We test the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) to spectral perturbations taking

an example of a Cs atom surrounded by superﬂuid helium. The atomic DFT of helium is used

to obtain the distribution of helium atoms around the impurity atom, and the electronic DFT

is applied to the excitations of the atom, averaging over the ensemble of helium conﬁgurations.

The shift and broadening of the D1 and D2 absorption lines are quite well reproduced by theory,

suggesting that the DFT may be useful for describing spectral perturbations in more complex

environments.

INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent density-functional theory has proven to be a powerful tool in the

description of optical absorption for molecules and clusters in free space (For a review, see

Ref. [1]. More recent citations can be found in Refs. [2, 3].). We would like to know whether

the theory can be extended to calculate the line shifts and broadening when the absorber

is embedded in a medium. Most applications have considered the electronic excitation from

a single frozen nuclear conﬁguration representing the ground state of an isolated molecular

or an ideal crystal, in which case the predicted absorption lines below the photoionization

threshold are sharp. Recently it was shown that the TDDFT also works well in describing

the broadening of the transitions and the strength of symmetry-forbidden transitions due

to zero-point vibrational motion, taking the example of the benzene spectrum [4]. In the

present work, we will calculate the eﬀects of external perturbations on the optical absorption.

We choose as a simple test case a Cs atom immersed in liquid helium at low temperature,

because of the simplicity both of the electronic structure and of the external perturbation.

In the long term we are interested in extending this kind of analysis more complex systems

which would require the full power of the time-dependent density functional theory.

Aside from our motivation from the perspective of applications of DFT, spectroscopic

measurements of impurity atoms and molecules in superﬂuid helium have been attracting

considerable interest in recent years [5]. The repulsive force between an impurity and helium

atoms induces a “bubble” around the impurity. This leads to a weak perturbation of helium

atoms on the spectra of impurities. The line shifts and spectral shapes induced by the helium

perturbation provide information on the properties of the bubble in the quantum liquid as

well as the excited states of the impurity. Since the perturbation is weak, this method

also provides a unique opportunity to spectroscopic measurements of atomic clusters at low

temperature [6, 7, 8].

The perturbations of Cs lines have been studied experimentally as a function of helium

density [9] and we shall calculate this system. There are two s-to-p transitions, the D1
(s1/2 →
widths. The shifts and widths of the two lines are diﬀerent, and the D2 line has a skewed

p3/2) lines, which are blue-shifted in helium and acquire

p1/2) and D2 (s1/2 →

shape suggesting a double-peak structure. These features were ﬁrst analyzed with a collective

vibration model of the helium bubble [10]. The model reproduced average peak shifts,

2

but gave line widths less than a half of observed ones. A more sophisticated analysis has

been made treating the liquid helium environment by the Path-Integral Monte-Carlo [11].

This quantum simulation has succeeded to reproduce observed D2 line proﬁles of the Cs

spectra. However, this computation method is very costly in computer resources. We are

thus motivated to develop an approach to treat helium perturbation that is both simple

and yet has quantitative accuracy. We will show that a density functional theory (DFT)

together with a statistical description of helium conﬁgurations meets our purpose. The

helium density distribution around an embedded atom is calculated with the DFT, and the

helium conﬁgurations are generated by a random sampling using the density distribution as

the sampling weight function.

Besides reporting the calculations on the absorption spectra of Cs in helium, we oﬀer some

simple qualitative interpretation of how the qualitative features of the spectrum reﬂect the

properties of the helium bubble around the atom.

II. FORMALISM

A. Description of liquid helium around an impurity atom

Among number of density functional methods for liquid helium, we adopt the Orsay-

Paris functional of Ref.

[12]. Although the Orsay-Paris functional is known to have some

problems with dynamic properties of liquid helium [13], it has a correct long-range behavior

and reasonable short-range characteristics. Since we are interested in a density proﬁle of

liquid helium, it should be adequate for our purposes.

that was used in Ref.

[14] to study atomic impurities in liquid helium. In that work, the

eﬀect of the impurity was treated by including a potential interaction VI(r) between it and

the helium atoms in the density functional,

(r) =

H0(r) + VI(r)ρ(r),

H

The VI(r) has important contributions from the repulsive between electrons and the helium

atoms, as well as the Van der Waals-type polarization interaction. Since we need to treat

interaction of impurity electrons with the helium atoms explicitly later on when we calculate

the electronic excitation, we introduce it here as well for calculating the helium distribution.

We approximate it as a contact interaction, i.e. of the form

Ve−He(re −

r) = V0δ(re −

r),

where re and r are coordinates of the electron and helium atom, respectively. The strength

V0 is determined from the electron-helium scattering length a as

where me is the electron mass. Then VI(r) is given by

where ρe(r) is the electron density of the impurity atom. We take a = 0.69 ˚A, corresponding
the observed low-energy electron-helium cross section σ = 6.0 ˚A2 [15]. We have also assumed

that the ion core is heavy enough to be treated as a classical particle at the origin. Since

Eq. (6) expresses the interaction between He atoms and an electron, the same interaction

will be used to estimate the energy shift of valence electrons due to the helium perturbation.

Carrying out the solution of Eq. (9) we ﬁnd the density proﬁle shown in Fig. 1. The three
curves give ρ(r) at equilibrium densities ρ0 of 0.0218, 0.0239, and 0.0253 ˚A−3, corresponding

to P = 0, 10, and 20 atm, respectively. One can see a sharp rise in the density at r
6
˚A. This corresponds to the bubble radius. An oscillatory structure appears on the density

≈

proﬁle, especially under high pressure. This feature is diﬀerent from that of a bubble model

adopted in Refs. [9, 10]. The maximum value of the density for P = 20 atm is about 0.0275
˚A−3 at r = 7.2 ˚A.

We use the ρ(r) computed above to generate conﬁgurations of helium atoms as follows.

Take a large volume surrounding the alkali atom and denote it as V . This volume includes N

helium atoms in average, where N is given by

V drρ(r) = N. We randomly sample N helium
positions in V according to the density distribution ρ(r). This sampling procedure gives

B. Helium perturbation on the atomic spectra

In the previous section, we described a density functional theory for calculating the

density proﬁle of liquid helium ρ(r), and taking account of the eﬀect of an impurity atom

at the origin. In this section, we discuss the calculation of the atomic spectrum, including

the eﬀects of the helium atoms.

We begin with the theory of the isolated atom. Orbital wave functions are calculated using

density functional theory with Dirac wave functions and kinetic energy operator. We need

6

accurate wave functions at large distances from the atom, which cannot be achieved with

the traditional LDA functional due to the incorrect orbital eigenvalues and the incorrect

asymptotic behavior of the potential. As is well known, these problems are diminished

with the GGA density functionals. We employ the GGA functional of Ref.

[16], which

has a gradient correction to produce correct asymptotic behavior of the potential. The

gradient correction includes an adjustable parameter β; we utilize this freedom to make the

orbital energy coincide with the measured one. For the s1/2 orbital, the orbital energy is

set equal to the ionization potential of Cs atom, 3.89 eV. For the p1/2 and p3/2 orbitals,

the orbital energies are set equal to the ionization potential minus the excitation energies

(about 1.43 eV). The quality of the wave function may be tested by examining the transition

oscillator strength. For D1 and D2 transitions, the calculated oscillator strength assuming

a pure single-electron transition is 1.034, in good agreement with measured value, 1.058.

The calculated electron density distributions are shown in Fig. 2. In principle, there will be

contributions to the transition from core electrons as well that can be taken into account with

the TDDFT. Applying the TDDFT to the present case, the core contributions reduce the

oscillator strength by some tens of percent, but do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the asymptotic

wave function of the valence electron. We therefore use the simpler single-electron wave

functions below rather than wave functions from the TDDFT.

ground state s1/2 and excited states p1/2 and p3/2, following the Frank-Condon principle.

the energy shifts. We then obtain two eigenenergies, each of which is doubly degenerate.

Each helium conﬁguration produces an energy shift and possible splitting but the tran-

sitions remain sharp. The line broadening comes from the ensemble average over helium
conﬁgurations. The line shape of the spectra for D1 (s1/2 →

C. Origin of peak shifts, broadening, and splitting

(17)

p3/2)

(18)

In this section, we discuss qualitatively argument how the blue shifts, the broadening

of the lines, and the splitting of D2 transitions occur. First consider a valence electron of

the alkali atom interacting with a single helium atom at a position R with respect to the

impurity atom. The energy shift of the valence electron is determined by the electron wave

function at the position of helium atom, ψ(re = R).

For s1/2 and p1/2 states, the energy shift ∆ǫ is calculated as

∆ǫ(k) = V0ρ(k)

e (R),

(19)

as the ﬁrst-order perturbation by Ve−He. Since V0 is positive, the energy shift, Eq. (19), is

also positive. As may be seen from Fig. 2, the wave function of the p1/2 state is considerably

8

larger than the s1/2 state outside the bubble. Thus, we expect a blue shift of D1 excitation
spectra, ∆ǫ(p1/2)

∆ǫ(s1/2) > 0.

−

For p3/2 states, the situation is slightly more complicated, because, in general, there are

oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements among degenerate states with diﬀerent m. However, all the oﬀ-

diagonal elements vanish if we assume that the helium atom lies on the Z-axis, X = Y = 0

and Z = R. We lose no generality in the case of a single helium atom. The helium atom at

Z = R produces an energy shift ∆ǫ as

where ¯ρ(k) is the angle-average electron density. There is no shift for

ﬁrst-order perturbation by Ve−He. As a result, the D2 transition splits into two peaks; one

∆ǫ(s1/2) > 0, and the other has a small red shift,

of the perturbing helium atom. Also one can neglect the small energy diﬀerence between

the two spin orbit partners. Then the energy shift of

p1/2 states. Note that the average shift of the D2 components is the same as the D1 line.

In summary, a helium atom at a distance R shifts the D1 transition by ∆

(R).

≡

The energy of D2 transition splits into two: one has no shift and the other is shifted by 2∆.

This explains qualitatively the overall blue shift of both lines and the skewed proﬁle of the

D2 line.

However, while the observed D2 line shape can be analyzed as a sum of two components,

both components are blue shifted roughly the same amount as the D1 line. This shows the

shift is due to the simultaneous interaction with several helium atoms. For example, if two

helium atoms are at (R, 0, 0) and at (0, 0, R), again, a D2 line splits into two. However,

in this case, both have blue shifts (∆ and 3∆).

If three helium atoms are at (R, 0, 0),

(0, R, 0), and (0, 0, R), then, D2 line shows a blue shift of 3∆ but no splitting. Roughly

speaking, the magnitude of line shift is determined by number of helium atoms contributing

to the perturbation and the splitting is determined by anisotropy of the helium conﬁguration

which increases as the square root of the number of atoms, assuming that there are no

correlations between atoms. The average energy shift remains the same for the D1 and D2

lines, irrespective of the number of helium atoms causing the perturbation.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To calculate line shapes of the Cs D transition in a helium, we evaluated Eq. (2.18)

and (2.19) by sampling 100 000 helium conﬁgurations, generated according to the density

proﬁles in Fig. 1. The calculated energy shifts are added to the observed D lines of free

Cs atom (λ = 894.9 nm for D1 and 852.7 nm for D2). Then, the intensity is estimated

by counting number of events in bins of wavelength ∆λ = 0.1 nm. The obtained intensity

spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The D1 line can be well approximated by a single Gaussian,

although there is a slightly larger tail at high-energy (low-wavelength) side. On the other

hand, the D2 line has a double-peaked structure. This feature agrees with the experimental

observation [9, 10].

Fig. 4 shows the pressure dependence of the peak shift and broadening of the D1 excitation

lines. The peak shift reproduces the observed pressure dependence, but comes out about

20% lower than measured. The diﬀerence could be due to an incorrect asymptotic wave

function in the Cs atom; only a 10% error in the wave function would be required to explain

the diﬀerence. Or the calculated helium bubble might be too large. Here, decreasing the
size of the bubble by 0.3 ˚A out of 6 ˚A would be suﬃcient to produce the measured peak

shift. We shall return to this later. The line broadening comes out better than would be

expected, given the quality of agreement for the peak shift. The agreement here shows that

the ﬂuctuations of the helium distribution are well described by the model adopted.

A qualitative measure of the ﬂuctuations can be constructed by deﬁning an eﬀective

number of helium atoms that contribute to the perturbation. Calling the shift from an

individual helium atom ∆(i), the total shift is

to be much smaller than the number in the ﬁrst shell. Therefore, we may say that the

perturbation on the valence electron is dominated by a small number of helium atoms in the

inner surface of a bubble. This fact indicates the importance of treating the perturbation

from individual helium atoms in describing ﬂuctuation eﬀect.

We can also understand the order of magnitude of the ﬂuctuation eﬀects using Meﬀ.

Assuming independent helium atoms, the ﬂuctuations are proportional to 1/√Meﬀ. Thus

we would expect that widths of the lines and the splitting of the components of the D2 would

be proportional to the average shift times that quantity. In fact the D1 width is about 1/2
of its average shift in the zero pressure data, to be compared with 1/√Meﬀ ≈

pressure, the splitting of the components relative to the average shift is just 1/3, agreeing

with our very crude argument.

In order to investigate eﬀects of the polarization potential that we so neglected, we

consider also a helium-Cs interaction that includes the van der Waals terms [17]. Once the

density proﬁle ρ(r) is determined, we use the interaction between a valence electron and

helium, Eq. (6), to calculate the atomic spectra. We ﬁnd that potential of Ref. [17] gives
a reduced radius for the helium bubble at zero pressure, by about 0.3 ˚A. As a result, the

blue shift increases by about 35 cm−1 at P = 0, which ﬁts the experimental data very well.

The line width is also slightly increased. This enhancement of blue shifts is decreasing as

the pressure is increasing. The calculation shows almost no additional shift at P=20 atm.

Next, let us discuss eﬀects of correlations among helium atoms. The He-He correlation

should inﬂuence the line width because it removes some part of ﬂuctuations of the He

conﬁguration. Roughly speaking, the radial ﬂuctuation controls the line width and the

angle ﬂuctuation determines the skewness of D2 line. To test this, we sample the helium
(14), taking d = 2.377 ˚A. We

conﬁgurations using the probability distribution of Eq.

construct the distribution function g(r) in Eq. (14), so as to reproduce the density proﬁle

ρ(r) determined by the DFT, Eq. (9). The results are displayed in Fig. 5 and also in Fig. 4

with open squares. The correlation eﬀect does not change the average peak positions at

all. However, it reduces the line widths, especially when the liquid helium is under high

pressure. At P = 20 atm, the FWHM of D1 line is calculated to be 150 cm−1, which well
agrees with the experiment (140 cm−1). The skewness of D2 line also becomes smaller.

IV. SUMMARY

We have developed a simple model to describe atomic spectra of impurities embedded

in the superﬂuid helium. Our description employs a density functional theory for the he-

lium distribution, and treats helium conﬁgurations statistically. The model is applied to

the spectra of Cs atom embedded in superﬂuid helium. Various features in the spectra,

which include line shifts, broadening, and skewness, are nicely reproduced in our calculation

without any adjustable parameters. Thus we are conﬁdent that our model includes basic

physical elements of the helium perturbation correctly. Since the model is simple enough

to apply to more complex systems such as molecules and clusters, we wish to analyze these

systems in future.

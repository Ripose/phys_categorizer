Abstract
- For a long time, one of the main
limitations of cesium atomic fountains has been
the cold collision frequency shift [2, 7, 10, 11].
By using a method based on a transfer of pop-
ulation by adiabatic passage (AP) [12, 16, 18]
allowing to prepare cold atomic samples with a
well deﬁned ratio of atomic density as well as
atom number we have a better measurement
of this eﬀect. By improving the method we
found out some unexpected properties of cold
collisions, conﬁrming that 133Cs is a rich atom
to study cold collisions. Those results lead
to ﬁne comparisons with cold collision theory
and may constraint some parameters of cesium.

part, we improved the loading rate by supplementing
a transverse collimation of the atomic beam in addition
to the present chirp cooling (see FIG. 1). It consists in
a 2D optical molasses with two laser beams, recycling
the light in a “zigzag” way [19, 21]. This allows us to
cool 109 atoms in 200 ms in an optical molasses. The
2D molasses increase the loading rate by a factor of
∼ 10. Regular parameters of the double fountain are
a magnetic ﬁeld in the interrogation zone of 2 mG, a
loading duration of ∼ 200 ms that allows to load 109
atoms within a fountain cycle of ∼ 1.2 s. The launch
velocity is ∼ 4 m.s−1 that imply a launch height of ∼
0.8 m.

INTRODUCTION.

Frequency stability.

Frequency standards are used in many industrial
(Global Positioning System, navigation) and scientiﬁc
pursues (fundamental physic tests [5, 15]). Primary
standards are today based on cesium and are contribut-
ing to the realization of the second. The most accurate
are using cold atoms to allow long interaction time. In
cold atomic gases collisions play an important role by
shifting the clock frequency. Thus, it is crucial to con-
trol and to study accurately cold collisions for clock
uncertainty budget. Nevertheless, there is a tradeoﬀ
between the clock stability and its accuracy. In this pa-
per we will describe improvement of the a technic based
on fast AP that allows to reconcile those two goals. For
high density atomic sample, such as in Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) [1], manifestations of collision such
as molecular Feshbach resonances [8, 23] are observed.
We found out, in our fountain, such phenomenon at
very low magnetic ﬁeld and density. Theoretical tools
will be remind and a numerical simulation of some of
our data will be presented.

A sapphire cryogenic oscillator (SCO) [13] from the
University of Western Australia is now used as a ﬁlter
for one of our H-maser. The SCO is an experiment by
itself [24], but is very reliable and can be used routinely
to drive the fountain. The SCO is weakly phase-locked
on the H-maser with a time constant of about an hour.
Therefore, the resulting signal reﬂects the good short
term stability of the SCO while in long time scales it
reproduce the characteristics of the H-maser. The SCO
delivers a signal of about 12 GHz.

At BNM-SYRTE most of the microwave synthesizer
use a 100 MHz signal to generate the 9.2 GHz necessary
to interrogate the atoms. Therefore, a down-converter
has been developed to transform the SCO signal into a
100 MHz one. An evaluation has shown that the foun-
tain was limited by the phase noise of the microwave
setup. Henceforth, a new microwave synthesizer [6]
able to down-convert directly the 12 GHz to 9.2 GHz
has been built in order to minimize the phase noise. It
achieves a frequency stability of ∼ 3 10−15 at 1s. In

and 133Cs, so that there is two pairs of cavity ﬁnely tuned
on hyperﬁne atomic frequency of corresponding atoms and
two ovens. On the cesium part, a transversal collimation
of the atomic beam has been improved in addition of the
present chirp cooling. This consists in a 2D recycling light,
pair of laser beam, used in a “zigzag” way. This allows to
load around 109 atoms in 200 ms in an optical molasses.

order to take beneﬁts of its excellent short term sta-
bility (∼ 5 10−16 at 1s) a large number of trapped
atoms is required [20]. With ∼ 107 detected atoms
we were able to reach 1.6 10−14 at 1 s, the best fre-
quency stability for a primary standard to date. With
this performances a resolution of 10−16 is achievable in
6 hours.

FIG. 2 shows the Allan deviation of the fountain
driven by the SCO. This is a diﬀerential measurement
[22], this means that a full atom number conﬁguration
((cid:4)) is alternated with a half atom number conﬁgura-
tion (•) each 60 fountain cycles. The ((cid:4)) represents
the fractional frequency deviation of the corrections
applied to the interrogating microwave generated with
the SCO signal to stay at resonance with the atoms.
This is performed with the maximum atom number
(Nat) which allows the 1.6 10−14 at 1s stability. On
short term (10 s to 100 s) the allan variance is domi-
nated by the Cs fountain noise. After 200 s, the drift
of the SCO is observed. The Allan deviation of the fre-
quency diﬀerence between low (Nat/2) and high(Nat)
density (N) averages as white frequency noise for all
times and reaches ∼ 2 10−16 for a 20000 s measure-
ment. This leads to a good statistical evaluation of
the mean diﬀerence in very reasonable time. The SCO
drift is eﬃciently rejected and atom number depen-
dent eﬀects (i.e. cavity pulling [3] and collisional shift)
are measured with a statistical uncertainty of 10−16 in

of the collisional frequency shift is only limited by the
frequency stability of the fountain.

ACCURATE CONTROL OF COLD COLLISION
FREQUENCY SHIFT.

In previous work [18], we demonstrated the possi-
bility to control and evaluate the cold collision shift
at the percent level by using the adiabatic passage
method. Cold collisions represent the main systematic
eﬀect that shifts the frequency and restricts the accu-
racy in cesium fountains. At that time, our collisional
shift for full density, was around 10−14. Therefore, the
corresponding uncertainty was near 10−16.

Adiabatic passage performances.

To achieve a stability around ∼ 2 10−14 at 1 s it is
necessary to load a high number of atoms. For exam-
ple the collisional shift corresponding to Nat of the ((cid:4))
curve implies a frequency shift of about ∼ 1.2 10−13.
Thus, an AP at the percent level is no longer enough to
stay at the 10−16 level of uncertainty on this eﬀect. To
perform AP the amplitude of the microwave into the
selection cavity has to be modulated and its frequency
has to be swept. It is critical that the synthesizer used
to chirp the selection microwave stops the frequency
sweep at resonance for the half AP. Our model (Mar-

the atoms is coming from the push beam (see FIG. 1,
i.e. a laser beam that ﬁnalize to the selection process)
which is de-pumping atoms from the |4; mFi states to
the |3; mFi states. The remanning fraction seem to be
launched in the F = 3 state. Attempts to remove these
atoms with extra repumper beams where partially un-
successful. At this point, there is nothing much to do
to prevent it but to look at the contribution of those
spurious atoms on the clock shift.

Towards an adiabatic passage at the 10−3 level.

An accurate control of the collisional shift is possible
only if the contribution of the 0.3 % atoms populating
states diﬀerent from the clock states is correctly evalu-
ated. To measure this, we intentionally populated the
atomic cloud using AP with |3; mF 6= 0i states in addi-
tion of the |3; 0i clock state. An additional microwave
synthesizer tuned on a |4; mF 6= 0i → |3; mF 6= 0i tran-
sition is combined in the selection cavity with the reg-
ular selection synthesizer. A magnetic ﬁeld is applied
during the selection by AP in order to prevent para-
sitic excitations between zeeman sub-levels. To select,
for example mF = 1 state, one has to detune from res-
onance the extra synthesizer of the corresponding ﬁrst
order Zeeman shift value.

The measurement method alternate three diﬀerent
fountain conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst one is a full AP se-
lection of the |3; 0i state, the second is a half AP se-
lection of the |3; 0i state. The ﬁrst conﬁgurations give
the collisional shift due to the clock states. The third
one is a full AP selection of the |3; 0i state plus full
AP selection of one of the |3; mF 6= 0i states. The
last conﬁguration combined with the two others lead
to a measurement the collisional shift due to the extra
population. The respective frequency shifts are:

∆ν1 = ˜n00K00

∆ν2 =

K00

Where ˜n00 (˜nmFmF) represents the atom density of
the clock states (mF states), and K00 (KmFmF) is the
cold collisional shift coeﬃcient resulting of the extrap-
olated to zero density for the clock states (mF states).
Under regular operating conditions, we evaluate the
contribution to the clock shift due to the collisional
shift of the extra |3; mF 6= 0i atoms per detected atom
(νmFmF in Hz.(detected atoms)−1) normalized to the
collisional shift of the clock states |3; 0i atoms per de-
tected atoms (ν00) as a function of the mF value. This

lyzed using this criterion to verify that the AP method
is properly working.

population can be as large as the standard clock shift.
Let’s remind that our regular magnetic ﬁeld is 2 mG.
One has to be very cautious by choosing a value of
magnetic ﬁeld in an experiment using cold 133Cs. The
|mF| = 2 resonance is obviously a multiple resonance,
but the |mF| = 1 and specially |mF| = 3 look to be
more simple. Assuming that |mF| = 3 resonance is a
simple resonance we try to understand the line shape
with a simple model.

Theoretical approach: model for S-matrix.

In order to describe the measured resonances, we
need to account for the inelastic collision processes.
Feshbach resonances in cold atomic systems are usu-
ally considered only in the context of elastic scattering,
with one open channel only [14, 17]. In such a situa-
tion, only an elastic resonance width Γe is involved,
and the incoming channel for the atoms is simulta-
neously the exit channel. Here we consider a situation
with more than one open channel. Atoms which exit in

Were N00 (NmFmF) is the detected atoms number
for the clock states (mF state) and can be expressed
as N00 = A|3;0i + A|4;0i. A veriﬁcation that ν00 is
ﬁeld independent has been performed so that it could
be used as a reference. It is important to ensure that
the density is the same whatever the could is made
of. Thus a veriﬁcation that the spatial distribution
of the diﬀerent Zeeman sub-levels is homogenous into
the cloud has been performed. By selecting one mF at
the time and pulsing the Ramsey cavity with diﬀerent
durations, we access at diﬀerent cloud slice. It shows
that the peak density are equal to less than 7 %.

FIG. 4 displays R0mF as a function of the mF value
for regular conditions (B ≃ 2 mG). The contribu-
tion to the cold collision shift of the |mF| = 1; 2 are
negative and equal for the same absolute values. At
most the contribution of spurious |3; mF 6= 0i is 1/3 of
the contribution of clock states. Thus, the collisional
shift is controlled at the 10−3 level. Surprisingly the
contribution of the |mF| = 3 is diﬀerent, which was
unpredicted at such low magnetic ﬁeld. This observa-
tion is a clear indication of the presence of Feshbach
resonances.

FESHBACH RESONANCES.

Experimental results.

We thus looked for the ratio (R0mF ), for each abso-
lute value of the mF as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. We
found out three Feshbach resonances (FIGs. 5, 6 and 7)
deeply ﬁeld dependent. It gives a direct access to the
amplitude and the width of each resonance. The ﬁeld
is very well controlled so that there is no way that error
bars could mix up the shapes. For some values of the
magnetic ﬁeld the frequency shift due to |3; mFi 6= 0

where α and β refer to the |3; 0i and |4; 0i clock
states respectively. ργγ is the atomic density of the
|3; mF 6= 0i state (denoted as γ). To be consistent
with our initial intent to analyze the |mF| = 3 data
as a single Feshbach resonance, we will assume that
a resonance occurs for only one of the two entrance
channels (αγ and βγ). The other entrance channel
contribute only with a constant background part, in-
dependent on the magnetic ﬁeld. This factor can be
formally accounted for in the background term of the
channel where the resonance occurs. Therefore, we are
assuming that Sαγ = 1 (resp. Sβγ = 1) while Sβγ(k)
(resp. Sαγ(k)) follows Eq. (8).

Eq. (9) clearly shows that the clock shift depends on
the wavenumber k. The total clock shift is obtained by
suitably averaging Eq. (9) over the duration of the in-
terrogation, taking into account the atomic cloud space
and velocity distribution. This is done using a Monte
Carlo simulation where the atomic trajectories are ran-
domly sampled according to the space and velocity dis-
tributions as measured in the experiment (with CCD
imaging and analysis of time of ﬂight signals). The
simulation accounts for the distribution of collisional
energy, for the time varying (decreasing) atomic den-
sity, for the non-uniform response of the ﬁnal transition
probability to a time varying perturbation (sensitivity
function), for the truncation of the atomic cloud cross-
ing the microwave resonator.

FIGs. 8 and 9 represent examples of calculated line
shape of the Feshbach resonance for various param-
eters. For all cases, we take abg = 0, B0 = 0 and
∆µ = 2µB. Also, we assume that the resonance occurs
on the βγ channel. The initial distribution is gaus-
sian with σ = 3.5 mm. The velocity distribution is
c )−b with vc = 10 mm.s−1 and b = 2.1. The
∝ (1+v2/v2
vertical axis represents the fractional frequency shift
due to the γ (|3; mF i) state for 108 atoms launched
in this state. This corresponds to a typical eﬀective
atomic density of 2.2 107 cm−3. In FIG. 8, Γi = 0. Ce
is equal to 0.4×Erec/krec, 4×Erec/krec, 40×Erec/krec
and 400 × Erec/krec where Erec = ~2k2
rec/2m and
krec = 2π/λ, λ = 852 nm. For large values of Ce,
the shape and the (“natural”) width of the resonance
is determined by Ce. The resonance has a symmet-
rical dispersive shape. For small values of Ce, the
shape and the width of the resonance is determined
by the collision energy distribution. The line shape
shows a strong asymmetry. The calculation clearly in-
dicates that the top of the sharp feature corresponds
to the magnetic ﬁeld that meets the resonant condi-
tion (vanishing diﬀerence between the molecular bound
state energy and the dissociation threshold). Similarly,

a diﬀerent channel than the incoming channel will gain
additional kinetic energy, and are considered as lost.
This decay process can be mediated via the molecular
Feshbach state, and gives rise to an additional energy
scale, the inelastic resonance width Γi [9].

The S-matrix for such an inelastic resonance can be

written as

the colliding atoms, ν = ∆µ(B −B0) the detuning, and
Sbg(k) = exp(−2ikabg) the background (or direct) part
of the S-matrix. Here B0 is the magnetic ﬁeld value of
resonance, and ∆µ the diﬀerence between the magnetic
moments of the two particles in the incoming channel
and the molecular Feshbach state. The background
scattering length abg = ar
bg contains not only a
real part ar
bg, but also an imaginary part ai
bg since there
is also a direct contribution to the inelastic decay.

The energy widths are in principle a function of the
relative wavenumber k, since they depend on the over-
lap between the molecular wavefunction corresponding
to the Feshbach state, and the wavefunction in the cor-
responding open channel. In case of the elastic energy
width, the energy dependence of the incoming chan-
nel gives rise to linear dependence in wavenumber, i.e.
Γe = cek with ce a constant [17]. For the inelastic
energy width, however, the energy dependence of the
corresponding open channels can be safely neglected
over the energy range of interest. Therefore Γi can be
taken energy-independent.

small values of Ce, the shape and the width of the resonance

shape shows a strong asymmetry. The calculation clearly
indicates that the top of the sharp feature corresponds to
the magnetic ﬁeld that meets the resonant condition.

the possibility of a slow variation of the background
scattering length with the magnetic ﬁeld through the
addition of a linear and quadratic term as a function
of the magnetic ﬁeld. We checked that the following
analysis is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by this additional
term. Finally, the model includes a scale factor for the
atomic density. Similarly, the inclusion of this scale
factor has no inﬂuence on the following analysis.

The simple consideration of the sign of the data in-
dicates that the resonance occurs in the βγ channel in-
volving the upper clock state |4; 0i and the |3; 3i state.
FIG. 10 shows the optimized ﬁt to the data. The qual-
itative agreement with the model is quite satisfactory.
For ∆µ, Ce and Γi, the analysis does not lead to precise
value, due to the sensitivity of these parameters to the
atomic cloud space and velocity distribution. We ﬁnd
∆µ ≃ 1.5µB, Ce ∼ 0.4Erec/krec and Γi . 0.4 × Erec.
Conversely, B0 is tightly constrained and well decor-
related from the other parameters. Although an un-
certainty on B0 cannot be easily extracted from our
(non-linear) ﬁtting procedure, we can safely state that
B0 is constrained to within 1 mG (to be understood
as a 1σ error bar). We ﬁnd B0 = 5 ± 1 mG. The cor-
responding uncertainty on the energy of the molecular
bound state causing the resonance is ∼ 100 nK.

with the measured line shape clearly indicates that the

A calibration of Zeeman sub-states contribution to
the clock shift as a function of the ﬁeld has been
performed and teaches us magnetic ﬁeld values to

for their contribution shows an upper limit compatible
with AP at the 10−3 level. This makes reachable the

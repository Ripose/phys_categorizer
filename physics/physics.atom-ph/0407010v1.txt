Abstract

In a recent experiment at the VUV free-electron laser facility at DESY in Hamburg, the gen-

eration of multiply charged ions in a gas of atomic xenon was observed. This paper develops a

theoretical description of multiphoton ionization of xenon and its ions. The numerical results lend

support to the view that the experimental observation may be interpreted in terms of the nonlinear

absorption of several VUV photons. The method rests on the Hartree-Fock-Slater independent-

particle model. The multiphoton physics is treated within a Floquet scheme. The continuum

problem of the photoelectron is solved using a complex absorbing potential. Rate equations for the

ionic populations are integrated to take into account the temporal structure of the individual VUV

laser pulses. The eﬀect of the spatial proﬁle of the free-electron laser beam on the distribution of

xenon charge states is included. An Auger-type many-electron mechanism may play a role in the

VUV multiphoton ionization of xenon ions.

INTRODUCTION

An electron bound to an atom experiences electric forces, which on average point toward

the atomic nucleus.

If the atom is placed in a static electric ﬁeld, the electronic states

become unstable, as the potential arising from the superposition of the atomic and the

external electric ﬁeld enables electron emission via tunneling. This picture basically remains

valid even if the external electric ﬁeld is oscillating, at least as long as the oscillation period

of the electric ﬁeld is long in comparison to the electron tunneling timescale [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

For a typical valence-electron binding energy of the order of 10 eV and a laser photon energy

of about 1 eV—i.e., in the IR regime—the tunneling picture is meaningful for intensities

of 1013 W/cm2 or higher. However, at high radiation frequency (or at low intensity), this

picture fails, and it is more appropriate to adopt a multiphoton picture [6, 7, 8, 9]: An

atomic electron can be ejected following the absorption of a discrete number of photons.

The development of free-electron laser (FEL) [10] facilities at several places in the world

[11] has spurred substantial theoretical interest [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], but

until very recently, no radiation sources have been available to experimentally probe strong-

ﬁeld physics at VUV or shorter wavelengths. The situation changed when the VUV-FEL

at DESY, Hamburg, began operation [22, 23].

In one of the ﬁrst experiments with this

exceptional radiation source, xenon clusters were exposed to the intense VUV laser pulses

and were observed to absorb a surprisingly large number of VUV photons per atom [24], a

ﬁnding which was explained in terms of inverse bremsstrahlung [25]. No evidence for atomic

multiphoton processes was found in these ﬁrst measurements. Measurements using a more

sensitive detector, however, revealed the creation of multiply charged ions even in a gas of

free, unclustered xenon atoms [26]. An experimental time-of-ﬂight mass spectrum, averaged

over 100 consecutive VUV-FEL pulses, is shown in Fig. 1 [27]. The photon energy in that

experiment was 12.7 eV with a peak intensity of approximately 1013 W/cm2.

In this paper, we present a theoretical description of the interaction of xenon atoms

with an intense pulse of VUV photons. Our ﬁndings lend support to the interpretation

that the occurrence of multiply charged ions, as reported in Ref. [26], is a consequence of

VUV multiphoton ionization—a scientiﬁc ﬁrst at a photon energy of more than 10 eV. We

describe our computational method in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the results of our calculations

are presented and compared with experiment. We conclude with Sec. IV. Atomic units are

2

used throughout, unless otherwise noted.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

Using an independent-electron model, Geltman [28] (see also Refs. [29, 30]) was able to

arrive at a satisfactory representation of the ionic charge distributions observed in several

intense-laser experiments at photon energies of 6.4 eV and below [31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. Within

the framework of independent particles, each electron moves in the ﬁeld of the atomic nucleus

and in a mean-ﬁeld generated by the other electrons. The best such mean-ﬁeld derives from

the Hartree-Fock self-consistent-ﬁeld method [36]. However, the Hartree-Fock mean-ﬁeld is

nonlocal, due to the exchange interaction, and therefore cumbersome to work with. Slater

[37] introduced a local approximation to electron exchange, which is the principle underlying

the well-known Xα method [38].

In this work, we use the Hartree-Fock-Slater code written by Herman and Skillman [39],

which in the past has proved advantageous for atomic photoionization studies (see, for

example, Ref.

[40]). The resulting one-electron potential, VHS(r), is a central potential

(even for open-shell systems), which satisﬁes

for an atom of nuclear charge +Z and overall charge +q. In the original program of Herman

and Skillman, the Xα parameter was set to unity, in accordance with Ref. [37]. We adjusted

that parameter slightly (see Table I), so that the calculated 5p binding energy in Xe, Xe+,

Xe++, and Xe3+ agrees with experimental data [41, 42, 43, 44]. The situation is a little

more complex for Xe4+ and Xe5+. The experimental ionization potentials of these ions,

as determined from measured electron-impact ionization thresholds [45, 46, 47], vary by

as much as 18 eV. Utilizing the complete-active-space self-consistent-ﬁeld (CASSCF) code

implemented in the ab initio program package MOLPRO [48, 49]; an active space consisting

of the 4d, 5s, 5p, 6s, and 6p orbitals; and an eﬀective core potential [50], we obtained

ionization potentials of 53 and 64 eV for Xe4+ and Xe5+, respectively. The value for Xe4+

agrees with Ref. [45]; the one for Xe5+ is in agreement with Ref. [47]. As indicated in Table

I, we base the Xα parameters for Xe4+ and Xe5+ on the ionization potentials quoted above.

It should be mentioned that while our CASSCF calculation includes scalar relativistic eﬀects

in an approximate manner (through the eﬀective core potential), spin-orbit splittings have

not been taken into account.

in a ﬁnite-element basis set [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], which is described in detail in Ref. [57]. In

the calculations reported here, 4801 ﬁnite-element basis functions were employed, spanning

a radial grid from rmin = 0 to rmax = 80 bohr radii. For each orbital angular momentum
quantum number, l, considered, the ﬁrst 50 eigenfunctions un,l(r) of H (l)

AT were computed
that have eigenenergies εn,l at least as high as the energy ε5,0 of the 5s level. More strongly

bound levels are assumed to be fully occupied by core electrons and are not considered any

further. The calculated eigenfunctions un,l(r) satisfy the boundary conditions un,l(rmin) = 0

and un,l(rmax) = 0. At the current level of approximation, atomic multiplet structure is

absent. All electrons that can be associated with the quantum numbers n and l have the

same energy, εn,l, within our model. In particular, there is no energy dependence on the

magnetic quantum number, m.

In order to treat the problem of electron emission, a complex absorbing potential (CAP)

[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74],

iηW (r), is added to

the atomic Hamiltonian. The real, positive parameter η is the CAP strength. The local

one-electron potential W (r) is chosen here as

where c = 4 a.u. in this paper (which places the absorbing potential right outside the ionic

core). The CAP absorbs the outgoing electron and renders the associated wave function

square-integrable. Given a complete basis, there exists for a resonance eigenstate (a Gamow
vector) of the physical Hamiltonian with Siegert eigenvalue Eres = ER −
E(η) of the CAP-augmented Hamiltonian such that limη→0+ E(η) = Eres [62]. In a ﬁnite

iΓ/2, an eigenvalue

blocks (Eqs. (12) and (13)); and a unitary transformation has been applied that renders the

and of the Floquet-type [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81] (see, for example, Refs. [82, 83, 84, 85, 86]

and references therein for other computational approaches to atomic strong-ﬁeld physics).

In our calculations, µ runs from µmin = 0 to µmax, the minimum number of photons needed

to photoionize (see Table I). Thus, since electron emission can only take place after the

absorption of µmax photons, it is suﬃcient to apply the CAP only to the µmaxth diagonal

block, i.e.,

III. CALCULATIONS

As a test of our method, we determined the one-photon ionization cross section of neutral

Xe at a photon energy of 12.7 eV. In this calculation, s, p, and d waves were included, and

µmax was set to 1. Let us ﬁrst consider ionization of the 5p, m = 0 level. After assembling
the corresponding real symmetric matrix HAT + HEM + HI, those 120 eigenvectors of this
matrix were computed that have the largest overlap with the initial-state vector
.
Φ5,1,0,0i
The η-dependent complex symmetric eigenvalue problem of H [Eq. (6)] was then solved in
the subspace of the previously calculated eigenvectors of the real part of H. The chosen

|

subspace size of 120 provided converged results and, at the same time, allowed for extremely

fast optimization of the parameter η [see Eq. (5) and the text following it].

The η trajectory of the resonance energy in the complex plane, for an intensity of 1

W/cm2, is shown in Fig. 2. On the basis of this graph, a dynamic Stark shift of 7.31

a.u. and an ionization rate of γ5p,0 = 3.05

10−5 a.u. are found. Proceeding in a similar

fashion, the ionization rate of the 5p, m =

1 levels is calculated as γ5p,±1 = 2.01

Γ5p = ¯γ5p (6

where, for neutral Xe, q = 0 (q is the atomic charge). This procedure is approximately valid

also for q > 0, since spin-orbit interaction ensures that the 6

q 5p electrons are uniformly

−

distributed over m =

1, 0, +1.

−

We have checked that Γ5p is a linear function of the intensity, I, in the vicinity of 1

W/cm2. Thus, within the Herman-Skillman-based independent-particle model, the one-

photon ionization cross section of neutral Xe, at a photon energy of 12.7 eV, is 119 Mb.

This result, which diﬀers from the experimental cross section [87] by a little more than

a factor of 2, has been conﬁrmed by us using the same independent-particle model, but

treating the continuum problem with an R-matrix code [88] (see also Ref. [40]).

In order to test whether our CAP-Floquet program is also capable of describing multi-

photon physics, we investigated the two-photon ionization cross section of neutral Xe at 6.42

eV. Experimentally, this is known to be about 4

10−50 cm4 s [89]. With atomic s through

f waves and µmax = 2, we calculated a cross section of 6.2

10−50 cm4 s. Other calculations

of this quantity, which are similarly accurate, are reported in Refs. [90, 91, 92].

We calculated the (q + 1)-photon ionization cross section, σq+1, of Xeq+ at a photon

energy of 12.7 eV (see Table I) following a strategy analogous to the one described above

for neutral xenon:

The spatial proﬁle of the VUV-FEL beam in Hamburg, perpendicular to the beam axis,

has a Gaussian shape [27]. Let (ρ, ϕ, z) denote cylindrical coordinates with respect to that

is the z-dependent full-width-at-half-maximum of the Gaussian beam proﬁle. In the exper-

iment described in Ref.

[26], ∆ = 20 µm. The beam divergence was 17 mrad [27], from

which we estimate that z0 = 1.2 mm. The time-dependent pulse power is represented in Eq.

Since we are interested in the nonlinear response of Xe ions to the VUV laser pulses, it is

not permissible to use for P (t) the pulse shape obtained after averaging over many pulses.

The temporal shape of the individual FEL pulses has not been measured so far, but reliable

simulations of the FEL performance exist [23, 93], which are able to reproduce measured

FEL parameters and which, in addition, provide information about temporal pulse shapes

[94]. Ten representative, simulated pulses are shown in Fig. 3 [95]. We see that while the

averaged pulse may appear approximately Gaussian (with a pulse width of about 50 fs), the

individual pulses are not.

Including an attenuation factor of 0.2 [27], which takes into account the ﬁnite reﬂectivity

of the mirrors used to focus the FEL beam into the xenon gas, we solve, for each of the

pulses shown in Fig. 3, the rate equations

We calculated Nq for each of the 10 laser pulses in Fig. 3 and then determined the average
number of Xeq+ generated per laser pulse, < Nq >, which is depicted in Fig. 4. It is diﬃcult

to assess whether this result can already explain the measurements in Ref. [26]. According

to the calculation, Xe+ and Xe++ dominate by far, which is consistent with the fact that

the detector response to these two ions appeared to be saturated in the experiment [26].

The mass spectra in Ref. [26] have not been calibrated to account for the speciﬁc detector

response to ions of diﬀerent charge states [27], so they may not be linearly related to the

actual ion production rate. Moreover, several of the experimental parameters we employed

in our calculation are, in fact, not known very precisely. Among these are the gas density,

κ, and the spatial beam width, ∆ [27]. It should be mentioned, in addition, that the FEL

was not operating under optimal conditions when the data in Ref.

[26] were taken [27].

Therefore, the laser pulses our calculation is based on (Fig. 3) are, on average, more intense

than in the experiment.

The theoretical model we use also suﬀers from shortcomings. As mentioned earlier, mul-

tiplet splittings of the valence shell are not considered, which means the intermediate bound

states inﬂuencing the multiphoton ionization cross sections may not be suﬃciently accurate.

The spectral width, ∆ω/ω, of the laser pulses of, on average, 1 % [27]—which is broader

than the Fourier limit of a 50-fs pulse by an order of magnitude—is not included in the

present treatment. In the rate equations, Eq. (24), excited-state populations, phase eﬀects,

as well as nonsequential multiphoton processes are neglected. The latter, however, may be

expected to be strongly suppressed in the VUV regime, as conﬁrmed by the measurements

in Ref. [26].

Before concluding, we would like to mention an interesting many-electron eﬀect that leads

to an enhancement of the multiphoton ionization rate in the xenon ions. In Xe+, it requires

11.3 eV [96] to excite one of the two 5s electrons to the 5p shell. (Within the Herman-

Skillman model we ﬁnd 10.9 eV.) One can, therefore, envisage, as one of the paths leading

to two-photon ionization of Xe+, the excitation of a 5s electron by a ﬁrst VUV photon and

9

the subsequent excitation of one of the 5p electrons to a virtual state bound in the channel

associated with the 5s hole, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Due to electron correlation, one of

the remaining 5p electrons can ﬁll the 5s hole, and the excited electron is ejected into the

continuum. This is a kind of Auger decay of the inner-valence excited ion, resulting in the

formation of Xe++. A similar scenario is conceivable for the more highly charged xenon ions.

The contribution of this to the multiphoton ionization cross section of Xeq+ can be crudely

estimated as follows. We choose

as initial-state vector in our Floquet code, but

Φ5,0,0,0i
|

instead of utilizing a CAP, we simply assign an autoionization width Γauto (i.e. we add
iΓauto/2) to those diagonal elements in the µmaxth diagonal block that satisfy εn,l + ε5,1 −
−
5s transition is
ε5,0 > 0. This condition implies that the energy released in the 5p

→

suﬃcient to transfer the electron with quantum numbers n and l into the continuum. A

typical lifetime of an inner-shell hole is of the order of 10 fs (or shorter), so we set the

autoionization width to 65 meV.

Let us call γ5s the 5s-mediated ionization rate determined in this way. The total 5s-

mediated ionization rate of Xeq+ is then, approximately,

Γ5s = 2γ5s

(7

q) .

The factor of 2 in this expression is needed since there are two 5s electrons in all Xe ions

considered here. If we assume that the six 5p spin orbitals have equal probability of being

occupied, then the probability that the 5p, m = 0 spin orbital with the right spin is un-

occupied is q/6. After the virtual excitation of one of the 5s electrons, there are 7
electrons available for the absorption of the remaining µmax −

1 photons.

The ionic charge distribution computed using the multiphoton ionization cross sections

in Eqs. (27)-(31) is displayed in Fig. 6. Now the production of Xe3+ is clearly visible even

on a linear scale: About 500000 triply charged xenon ions are produced per laser pulse. The

number of Xe6+ ions per laser pulse is more than 500, which is also not particularly small.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated in this paper multiphoton ionization of atomic xenon and its ions at

a photon energy of 12.7 eV, a radiation intensity of order 1013 W/cm2, and a pulse duration

of about 50 fs. A recent experiment employing the VUV-FEL at DESY has demonstrated,

under these laser conditions, the generation of xenon charge states of up to 6+ [26].

In

the infrared, even a pulse that is three orders of magnitude longer (with about the same

intensity), produces charge states no higher than Xe4+ [33].

Using an eﬀective one-particle model, in combination with the Floquet concept and a

complex absorbing potential, we have calculated VUV multiphoton ionization cross sections

that refer to the absorption, by a 5p electron, of as many photons as are needed to ionize

it. We have also estimated the inﬂuence of 5s excitation on the ionization cross sections

and found that it may be signiﬁcant. Although we grant that the model we applied is not

ideal for describing many-electron phenomena (a better many-body calculation would be

desirable), the result of our estimate indicates that at VUV photon energies multiphoton

ionization is driven, at least partly, by electronic many-body physics. Focussing on the

behavior of a single active electron does not appear to be suﬃcient.

Taking a rate-equation approach and utilizing simulated FEL pulses [95], we determined

the average number of Xeq+ ions produced per VUV laser pulse. This step depends heavily

on a number of important experimental parameters [27]. In our calculation, hundreds of

Xe6+ ions are found to be generated per pulse, and a correspondingly higher number for the

lower charge states. Hence, the experimental observation of multiple ionization of xenon,

Ref. [26], appears compatible with the nonlinear absorption of several photons. We conclude

that multiphoton physics is indeed relevant for some processes driven by the intense VUV

beam of the free-electron laser in Hamburg. For more quantitative comparisons, it will be

desirable for future experiments to obtain a calibrated ionic charge distribution, as well as

FIG. 1: Free-electron laser pulses with a peak intensity of about 1013 W/cm2, a duration of

approximately 100 fs, and a photon energy of 12.7 eV produce, in an atomic xenon beam, ionic

species of various charge states [26]. In this ﬁgure [27], a time-of-ﬂight mass spectrum is shown

that was obtained after averaging over 100 consecutive FEL pulses.

level of atomic xenon (which deﬁnes the origin in the ﬁgure). Due to the interaction with 12.7-eV

photons, this level is shifted as well as broadened. The point of stabilization of the η trajectory

FIG. 3: The VUV laser pulses supplied by the free-electron laser source at DESY, Hamburg, are

ultrashort, with an average width of about 50 fs, and intense, with a pulse energy of order 10 µJ

[23]. The pulses shown in this ﬁgure [95] have been calculated using an FEL simulation program

[93, 94].

FIG. 4: The average number, < Nq >, of Xeq+ ions produced per VUV-FEL laser pulse, as

calculated on the basis of the multiphoton ionization cross sections in Eqs. (17)-(21), the laser

pulse properties [Eqs. (22), (23) and Fig. 3], the rate equations in Eq. (24), and the integral over

the interaction volume in Eq. (25). Note the logarithmic scale along the ordinate of the inset.

FIG. 5: Xe+ can be photoionized via the absorption of two VUV photons by a 5p electron. A

second ionization path, alluded to in this ﬁgure, involves a photon absorption that virtually excites

a 5s electron to the 5p shell. Simultaneously, a 5p electron is excited to an autoionizing state

associated with a Rydberg series converging to the 5s 5p5 threshold of Xe++. Electron correlation

then induces a transition from 5p to 5s accompanied by the emission of an electron.

20

FIG. 6: The same as in Fig. 4, the only diﬀerence being the fact that the multiphoton ionization

cross sections underlying the calculation were taken from Eqs. (27)-(31), not (17)-(21).

Abstract. The S-wave model of electron-hydrogen scattering is evaluated using the
convergent close-coupling method with an emphasis on scattering from excited states
including an initial state from the target continuum. Convergence is found for discrete
excitations and the elastic free-free transition. The latter is particularly interesting
given the corresponding potential matrix elements are divergent.

The convergent close-coupling (CCC) method has had many successes in the ﬁeld
of electron-impact excitation and ionization of atoms and ions.
In this method the
total wave function is expanded using N square-integrable states and the close-coupling
equations are solved in the form of coupled Lippmann-Schwinger equations for the
T -matrix elements (Bray and Stelbovics 1992a). The N states are obtained from a
truncated orthogonal Laguerre basis, and thus in the limit as N goes to inﬁnity, the
states span the entire Hilbert space. The CCC method was tested by Bray and Stelbovics
(1992b) on the Temkin-Poet (Temkin 1962, Poet 1978) (S-wave) model of electron-
hydrogen scattering, where only states of zero orbital angular momentum are retained.
The total cross sections for elastic, inelastic and ionization collisions converged, with
increasing N, for all projectile energies and agreed with the expected S-wave model
solutions, where available.

The success of the method for the S-wave model allowed application to many
real electron-atom scattering problems. However, application to ionization processes
revealed some fundamental diﬃculties (Bray and Fursa 1996, R¨oder et al 1997),
which have been subsequently best illustrated by returning back to the S-wave model
(Bray 1997). Though the total
ionization cross section (TICS) was found to be
convergent, the underlying singly diﬀerential cross section (SDCS) was not necessarily
so. The triplet SDCS showed rapid convergence, but the singlet SDCS showed
unphysical N-dependent resonances. Furthermore, the SDCS were not found to be
symmetric about E/2, where E is the total (excess) energy, even though antisymmetry
of the total wave function has been ensured explicitly. It was suggested that for both
total spin cases the CCC(N) amplitudes should converge (as N
) to a step function,
being identically zero past E/2 (Bray 1997). The step function model was attacked by
Bencze and Chandler (1999) who claimed to have proved (see their Eq.(20)) that the
CCC-calculated amplitudes should converge to the true amplitudes as N
, and
hence yield symmetric SDCS. This claim was rebutted (Bray 1999d) and a number of
counterexamples given (Bray 1999a, Bray 1999b).

Unfortunately, a proof for the step function idea has not been given, only suggestive
numerical evidence provided. This has encouraged others to study the problem more
closely. Baertschy et al (1999) obtained benchmark SDCS using an external complex
scaling technique (McCurdy et al 1997) that does not require the knowledge of three-
body boundary conditions. These were found to be in consistent agreement with the
CCC results. Furthermore, Rescigno et al (1999) showed how step functions may arise
when discretization with short-ranged potentials is used.

To our mind the closest to a proof of the step function idea has been given by
Stelbovics (1999). He showed that the close-coupling equations, obtained by using
exact target eigenstates to expand the total wave function, have unitarity satisﬁed
with the secondary energy integration ending at E/2. This implies a step function
in the underlying amplitudes since the coupled equations are formally written with
this integration ending at E. Given that the CCC square-integrable target states form
an equivalent quadrature rule for the inﬁnite summation over the true target discrete

Letter to the Editor

eigenstates simultaneously with an integration over the true target continuum it is
tempting to conclude that for inﬁnite N the CCC equations converge to those obtained
using exact target eigenstates, and hence the CCC ionization amplitudes should display
a step function behaviour. Furthermore, by comparison with the known SDCS at E/2,
he observed that the CCC-calculated singlet SDCS appeared to converge to 1/4 the
value of the true result, and suggested that the CCC equations appeared to behave like
Fourier expansions of the underlying amplitudes. A Fourier expansion of a step function
converges to the midpoint of the step height. Therefore, the CCC amplitude at equal
energy sharing converges to 1/2 of the step height, and hence the SDCS to 1/4 of the
true height.

This interpretation is very exciting because it explains the apparent convergence of
the SDCS at E/2, even when convergence is lacking at unequal energy-sharing, and how
it may be related to the true result. A detailed set of applications to the calculation of
equal-energy-sharing fully diﬀerential electron-impact ionization of the atomic hydrogen
ground state has been given (Bray 1999c). Here we examine convergence for scattering
from the excited states, and particularly of the free-free transitions. The latter are
interesting because it is the free-free V -matrix elements that are responsible for the
failure to date of solving the close-coupling equations involving pure atomic (discrete
and continuous) eigenstates, and thereby requiring the introduction of a pseudostate
approach. Free-free one-electron transitions have been looked at before, see Chrysos
and Fumeron (1999) for example. Here, for the ﬁrst time to the best of our knowledge,
free-free transitions involving two electrons are shown to be calculable.

Since we shall only concern ourselves with the S-wave model, momenta will be
written as scalars in what follows. The traditional close coupling equations arise upon
expanding the total wave function over the complete set of target eigenstates φn of
energy ǫn. Though we use a discrete notation, this involves an inﬁnite sum of the bound
states φn(ǫn) and an integral (dǫ) over the continuum states φ(ǫ). The close-coupling
equations may be written as coupled Lippmann-Schwinger equations for the T -matrix

The continuum integration ending at E comes from the fact that in (1) on the

close-coupling equations. Since antisymmetry is explicitly included in the VS (Bray
and Stelbovics 1992a) there appears to be a double-counting problem as the energy
integration ends at E and not E/2. However, as mentioned above, Stelbovics (1999)

Thus, the non-existence of free-free VS matrix elements in (1) has not been eliminated,
and becomes evident with increasing N. However, numerical solutions of (5) have shown
good convergence for the TS matrix elements, at least for excitation of the ground state
(Bray and Stelbovics 1992b). Here we check for convergence in the case of excited initial
states including a free-free transition.

The numerical investigation is performed for the total energy E = 3 Ry. The results
of three calculations, N=23, 26 and 29, are presented. The states were chosen in such a
way so that there was always a state of 1.5 Ry. This way all three calculations contain
the matrix elements of the free-free transition corresponding to two 1.5 Ry electrons
elastically scattering on a proton. In ﬁgure 1 we present the discrete excitation cross
sections and the SDCS, evaluated according to (8), for the singlet case. The value ǫi is
the initial energy of the bound electron when negative, or otherwise the energy of an
incident electron.

We begin the discussion of the cross sections for the negative-energy states. Good
convergence is seen for the ﬁrst ﬁve states for all four initial states, with elastic scattering
being the most dominant. For the higher (n > 5) lying discrete states the bigger
calculations yield the smaller cross sections, but in all cases the cross sections for the
last negative-energy states rise. This is not an indication of divergence from the expected
n−3 scaling rule, but shows how the least negative-energy states take into account the
remaining full inﬁnite discrete spectrum.

Turning our attention to the SDCS from the ground state, for energies less than E/2
we observe that there are substantial N-dependent oscillations about the exact result,
calculated using the ﬁnite diﬀerence method (FDM) by Jones and Stelbovics (1999). At
E/2 the three CCC calculations show convergence to approximately a quarter of the
FDM result, as expected.

The SDCS from the 2S and 3S initial states show less oscillation than for the ground
state owing to the SDCS at E/2 being of relatively small magnitude. Thus, within the
same calculations the CCC method is able to obtain SDCS more accurately, over the
energy range [0, E/2], from excited states than from the ground state.

Finally, we consider the free-free transitions for the case where the two electrons
are both incident at 1.5 Ry. It is seen that the functional form of the SDCS changes
as compared to the discrete initial states. Oscillations are very large, but convergence
at E/2 is evident, and presumably to one quarter of the true value. This suggests that
the elastic scattering is the most dominant, which explains the functional form change,
and is consistent with the elastic scattering from the presented discrete states being the
most dominant of the discrete transitions. It is truly remarkable to see convergence at
E/2 as the corresponding VS matrix elements are an order of magnitude greater than
the TS matrix elements and continue to increase with N.

For completeness, in ﬁgure 2 we present the cross sections for the triplet case. Here
the initial state with two 1.5 Ry electrons is forbidden and so is not presented. All
convergence considerations for the discrete excitations apply equally here as in the case
of singlet scattering. The SDCS are all free from oscillations owing to the zero cross
section at E/2, and good agreement is found with the FDM-calculated SDCS available
only for the ground state (Jones and Stelbovics 1999).

In summary, the recent work of Stelbovics (1999) has shown that the CCC theory
yields convergent ionization scattering amplitudes at equal energy-sharing that are
simply a factor of two less than the true amplitudes. Thus, the CCC theory may claim

to yield these amplitudes accurately for any initial state, and not only for the S-wave
model considered here. We have seen convergence in the model for the elastic free-free
transition which corresponds to the real experimental case of equal energy (2e,2e) on a
proton. Whereas such processes are yet to be experimentally observed the CCC (e,2e)
calculations include such processes as an intermediate step and these may be extracted
as convergent cross sections. This is particularly pleasing since the introduction of the
L2 technique in solving the close-coupling equations does not eliminate the divergence
of the underlying free-free potential matrix elements, but masks it with a dependence
on N. Finally, though Stelbovics (1999) does not claim this, we suggest that his work
implies a step function of the underlying amplitudes in forming (4) and hence the CCC-
calculated amplitudes used in (7), supporting our initial hypothesis (Bray 1997).

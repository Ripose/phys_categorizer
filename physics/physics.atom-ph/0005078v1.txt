I. INTRODUCTION

In 1973, Altschuler and Frantz patented an idea for
creating an atom interferometer (Altschuler and Frantz,
1973). The beam splitter in their apparatus was a
standing-wave optical ﬁeld. Their ideas were rekindled
by Dubetsky et al. (1984), who presented detailed cal-
culations of atomic scattering by standing-wave ﬁelds in
the context of atom interferometry. It was not until re-
cently, however, that experimentalists were successful in
constructing the ﬁrst atom interferometers. Double-slit
interference (Carnal and Mlynek, 1991; Shimizu et al.,
1992), Fraunhofer diﬀraction by microfabricated struc-
tures (MS) (Keith et al., 1991; Ekstrom et al., 1995)
or by resonant standing wave ﬁelds (SW) (Rasel et al.,
1995; Giltner et al., 1995), and Fresnel diﬀraction by one
(Chapman et al., 1995) or two (Clauser and Li, 1994)
MS have all been observed using atomic beams as mat-
ter waves.

Two types of atom-optical elements have been used as

beam splitters in these experiments, standing wave ﬁelds
or microfabricated structures. A SW beam splitter al-
lows one to operate with relatively dense atomic beams,
having densities up to 1010cm−3 and ﬂow densities up
to 1015cm−2s−1. Moreover, by varying the atom ﬁeld
detuning, one can use SW beamsplitters as either am-
plitude or phase gratings. Additional degrees of freedom
are provided by the polarization of the ﬁeld which can act
selectively on targeted magnetic state sublevels. A the-
ory of atom interference in standing wave ﬁelds has been
developed by Altschuler and Frantz (1973) , Dubetsky
et al. (1984), Chebotayev et al. (1985), Bord´e (1989),
Friedberg and Hartmann (1993, 1993a), Dubetsky and
Berman (1994) and Janicke and Wilkens (1994). In con-
trast to SW beam splitters, MS usually scatter atoms in
a state independent manner; as a consequence, most ex-
periments involving MS use atoms in their ground (or,
possibly, metastable) states. Microfabricated structures
provide 100% modulation of the incident atomic beam.
They oﬀer the additional advantage that their period and

1

duty cycle (ratio of slit opening to period) can be cho-
sen arbitrarily within the limits of current lithographic
technology. A theory of atom interference using MS has
been developed by Turchette et al. (1992) , Clauser and
Reinsch (1992) and Carnal et al. (1995) .

Both the splitting of an atomic beam into two or more
beams coherent with respect to one another and the re-
combining of the scattered beams are physical processes
that are essential to the operation of an atom interfer-
ometer. We consider scattering of atoms by an ideal MS,
having an inﬁnite number of slits, period d, duty cycle
f , and 100% transmission through the slits. Each MS is
normal to the y-axis, and the slits are oriented in the z-
direction, so that the axis of the MS is in the x-direction
(see Fig. 1).

FIG. 1. Matter-wave interference (a) and shadow eﬀect (b)
for a collimated atomic beam incident on a microfabricated
structure (M S) . (a) When an atom having given center of
mass momentum p k ˆy scatters from a MS having wave vec-
tor k =2πˆx/d, where d is the period of the MS, the output
wave function consists of a set of momenta states p+n¯hk
(two of them |pi and |p+¯hki are shown). A superposition
of these states’ wave functions leads to an interference pat-
tern on the screen, having the same period d as the MS’s.
(b) When a collimated beam of particles moving along classi-
cal trajectories scatters from MS, the beam proﬁle imprinted
by MS is copied on the screen. A beam consisting of two
velocity subgoups, having zero (v = 0) and nonzero (v 6= 0)
velocity projections on the x−axis is shown. Gratings associ-
ated with these two subgroups are shifted on the screen from
on another by ∆x = vt = v
u L, where t is the time of ﬂight
between the MS and the screen.

After scattering from a MS, each in-coming atomic
state ψ having x-component of center-of-mass momen-
tum p splits into a set of out-going states ψn having x-
components of momenta p + n¯hk (k = 2π/d, n is an

2

integer) which evolve as

ψn ∝ exp(cid:20) i

¯h

(p + n¯hk) x(cid:21) .

(1)

Interference of two components, such as ψ0 and ψ1, on a
screen (see Fig. 1a) leads to an atomic density grating

ρ ∝ Re[ψ0ψ∗1 ] = cos [kx]
having the same period d as the MS.

(2)

Observation of this grating in the experiments listed
above often has been considered as direct evidence for
matter-wave interference. Nevertheless, one can easily
see that such a conclusion is not necessarily justiﬁed. For
particles moving along classical trajectories (Fig. 1b),
and for a beam whose angular divergence is suﬃciently
small to satisfy

θb ≪

d
L

,

(3)

where L is a distance on the order of the distance be-
tween the MS and the screen, a shadow of the MS can
be seen on the screen at distances L where all matter-
wave eﬀects are completely negligible. This example is
the simplest manifestation of the classical shadow eﬀect
(Chebotayev et al., 1985; Dubetsky and Berman 1994).
To distinguish quantum matter-wave interference from
the classical shadow eﬀect, one needs to observe addi-
tional features of the phenomena or to choose a scheme
where one of the eﬀects is excluded. Young’s double-slit
experiment (Carnal and Mlynek, 1991; Shimizu et al.,
1992), as well as interference produced by a phase grat-
ing created using light that is far-detuned from atomic
transition frequencies (Rasel et al., 1995), cannot be ex-
plained in terms of atoms moving on classical trajecto-
ries. A matter-wave interpretation is also necessary if
one observes a shift in the fringe pattern resulting from
an index change in one of the arms of an interferometer
(Ekstrom et al., 1995). We determine below those partic-
ular conditions for which pure quantum interference can
be obtained using MS.

Let us estimate a typical distance for which quantum
interference eﬀects have to be included. Consider an in-
cident beam which has zero angular divergence. The
atoms are assumed to be in a pure state having mo-
mentum p = (0, py, 0) (see Fig. 2). Localization of the
atoms inside each slit leads to an uncertainty in the x-
component of atomic momentum δp ∼ ¯h
d , where it is as-
sumed that the slit width f d is comparable with the MS
period d. A beam passing through the slits acquires an
angular divergence δθ ∼ δp
, and atoms passing through
a given slit are deposited on the screen with a spot size
δx ∼ Lδθ ∼ L ¯h
. Interference occurs when spots pro-
duced by neighboring slits overlap, i. e. when δx ∼ d.
One ﬁnds, therefore, that the characteristic distance for

which matter-wave interference plays an essential role is
given by

for the diﬀerent out-going state amplitudes as a result of
diﬀraction. The relative dephasing is

FIG. 2. The incident atomic wave function after scatter-
ing from MS transforms into a superposition of the divergent
waves emitted from the each slit, having angular divergence
δθ inverse to the MS’s period d. (for the given duty cycle).
One estimates Talbot distance as a distance between MS and
screen large enough to provide overlapping of neighboring di-
vergent waves and their interference.

The manner in which this distance appears in the the-
ory of the optical or atomic Talbot-eﬀect is well known
in the context of the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ theory of diﬀrac-
tion [see, for example, (Patorski, 1989; Winthrop and
Worthington, 1965) for optical Talbot-eﬀect theory and
(Chapman et al., 1995; Turchette et al., 1992; Clauser
and Reinsch, 1992; Carnal et al., 1995) for atomic Talbot-
eﬀect theory]. One can obtain Eq. (4, 5) using another
description. When the number of slits in the MS and the
area of the incident atomic beam are inﬁnite, construc-
tive interference occurs only for those directions in which
p is changed by an integral multiple of the recoil mo-
mentum ¯hk. In the atomic ”rest-frame” (a frame moving
along the y−axis with velocity
u = py/M,

(6)

where M is the atomic mass) an out-going state with mo-
mentum p + n¯hk (1) acquires a phase φn = ǫp+n¯hkt/¯h,
where ǫp = p2
2M is the kinetic energy associated with
atomic motion along the x-axis and t is the time after
scattering from the MS. Comparing this phase with the
phase φ0 that an atom would acquire in the absence of
the MS, one sees that a dephasing δφ = φn − φ0 occurs

3

v = p

M is the x component of atomic velocity, and

ωk =

¯hk2
2M

is a recoil frequency, related to the energy that an atom,
having initial momentum p = 0, acquires as a result of
recoil during scattering. The two contributions to the
dephasing (7) have diﬀerent origins. The phase φD is a
Doppler phase that does not disappear in the classical
limit ¯h → 0; consequently, it must be classical in nature.
It is evident from Fig. 1b that, for atoms incident with a
nonzero value of p, the shadow moves along the x−axis
together with atoms. The nodes in the shadow are dis-
placed by a distance ∆x = vt along the x−axis, which
corresponds to a phase shift of 2π ∆x
d for the atomic grat-
ing, a phase shift that coincides with φD. The phase φD
is analogous to the phase a moving dipole driven by an
optical ﬁeld would acquire in its rest frame as a result of
the Doppler frequency shift.

The phase φt in Eq.

(7) is a quantum addition to
the dephasing, resulting from recoil. This contribution
is responsible for atomic scattering and for matter-wave
interference. Quantum eﬀects have to be included when
this phase is of order unity, that is, for times of order

tT = 2π/ωk.

(9)

One ﬁnds that length associated with this time in labo-
ratory frame coincides with the Talbot distance

LT = utT .

(10)

∼ 1 or L >

Thus, we are led to the same conclusion that we reached
above by considering the scattering from two adjacent
slits; for ωktT >
∼ LT , one must use a quantized
description of the atomic center-of-mass motion.
In this chapter we consider the Talbot-eﬀect and other
interference phenomena as a consequence of the recoil-
eﬀect. In the context of the nonlinear interaction of opti-
cal ﬁelds with an atomic vapor, the recoil eﬀect was con-
sidered by Kol’chenko et al. (1968) and observed by Hall
et al. (1976). Quantum structure resulting from the scat-
tering of atoms by a resonant standing wave (resonant
Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect), which can be attributed to atomic
recoil, was discussed theoretically by Kazantsev et al.
(1980) and observed by Moskovitz et al. (1983). Splitting

of optical Ramsey fringes (Baklanov et al., 1976) associ-
ated with the resonant Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect was discussed
theoretically by Dubetsky and Semibalamut (1978) and
observed by Barger et al. (1979). Matter-wave interfer-
ence resulting from resonant Kapitsa-Dirac scattering in
a standing wave ﬁeld has been studied theoretically by
Altschuler and Frantz (1973) , Dubetsky et al.
(1984)
and observed by Rasel et al. (1995). The theory of atom
interference presented here, based on an interpretation of
scattering of atoms by MS in terms of the recoil eﬀect, is
a natural extension of the work involving standing-wave
ﬁelds.

This chapter is organized as follows: in the next Sec-
tion we discuss conditions necessary for the observation
of matter-wave interference in diﬀerent regimes. Rigor-
ous proof of the equivalence of theories based on Fresnel-
Kirchhoﬀ integrals and on the recoil eﬀect is given in Sec-
tion III, as is a discusion of the atomic gratings that can
be produced as a consequence of the Talbot eﬀect. The
classical shadow eﬀect is analyzed in Section IV. Section
V is devoted to a theory of the Talbot-Lau eﬀect. The
Talbot and Talbot-Lau eﬀects for a thermal beam are
considered in the Section VI, in the limit where the char-
acteristic length scale in the problem is larger than the
Talbot length LT . A discussion of the results is given in
Section VII.

II. QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

The scattering of atoms by gratings can be separated
roughly into three categories: classical scattering, Fres-
nel diﬀraction, and Fraunhofer diﬀraction. The limit of
Bragg scattering (Martin et al., 1988), in which ωkℓ′/u ≥
1, where ℓ′ is the grating thickness, is not discussed in
this chapter.

A. Fresnel Diﬀraction

The Fresnel diﬀraction limit occurs when ωkt ∼ 1 or
L ∼ LT . Owing to the angular divergence of the inci-
dent beam, it is possible that the diﬀraction pattern at
L ∼ LT will be washed out. To ensure that this does not
occur, it is necessary that the spread of Doppler phases,
kutT θb = kLT θb, be smaller than unity. This require-
ment corresponds to inequality (3) when L ∼ LT . Using
Eq. (5), the condition on θb can be restated as

where

θb ≪ θd,

θd =

¯hk
py

=

λdB
d

(11)

(12)

4

is the angle associated with a single atomic recoil at the
MS (δp = ¯hk). The Talbot eﬀect refers to the self-
imaging of a grating in the Fresnel diﬀraction limit. For
self-imaging to occur, the displacement of the scattered
atomic beam LT θd must be much smaller than the beam
diameter D, which translates into the condition

D ≫ d.

(13)

In this limit, one can consider the beam diameter to be
inﬁnite to ﬁrst approximation; ﬁnite beam eﬀects (or,
equivalently, gratings with ﬁnite slit number) are dis-
cussed by Clauser and Reinsch (1992) .

Conditions (4, 11, 13) are suﬃcient to observe the Tal-
bot eﬀect.
In this case, the contribution to the wave
function’s phase resulting from atomic recoil is of order
unity, the scattered beams overlap almost entirely with
one another on the screen, and the atomic gratings are
not washed out after averaging over atomic velocities v in
the incident beam. Matter-wave interference is a critical
component of the Talbot eﬀect.

B. Fraunhofer Diﬀraction

Although the Talbot eﬀect illustrates a matter-wave
interference phenomenon, it does not result in an atom
interferometer having two arms that are nonoverlapping.
We refer to the Fraunhofer diﬀraction limit as one in
which the various diﬀraction orders are nonoverlapping
at a distance L from a single grating. The grating then
serves as a beam splitter that physically separates the
incident beam into two or more beams. To physically
separate the various diﬀraction orders over a distance L,
one must require that

Lθd ≫ D.

(14)

Using the fact that θd = λdB/d and setting t = L
can recast this inequality as

u , one

ωkt ≫ D/d ;

L/LT ≫ D/d,

(15)

which requires the quantum phase φt (7b) to be larger
than D/d >> 1. Consequently, quantum eﬀects play an
essential role in an atom interferometer having nonover-
lapping beam paths. Note that the Fraunhofer limit can-
not be reached for a beam having inﬁnite diameter. We
do not consider matter-wave interference in the Fraun-
hofer limit in this work.

C. Talbot-Lau Regime.

To achieve spatial separation of the beams in the
Fraunhofer limit and to observe the Talbot eﬀect, the
angular divergence θb of the incident beam must be less
than θd. For typical values d ∼ 200 nm, M ∼ 20

A.u., u ∼ 105 cm/s, the deﬂection angle θd ∼ 10−4
rad. Atomic beams having θb ≪ θd have been used to
observe atomic scattering by standing waves (Moskovitz
et. al., 1983), to build a two-arm atom interferometer
(Keith et al., 1991; Rasel et al., 1995; Giltner et al.,
1995), and to observe the Talbot-eﬀect (Chapman et al.,
1995). Such strong collimation results in a decrease in
the atomic ﬂux and a corresponding decrease in signal
strength that may be a limiting factor in certain applica-
tions of matter-wave interference, such as atom lithogra-
phy (Timp et al., 1992). Alternatively, one can observe
matter-wave interference in beams having larger angular
divergence using the atomic Talbot-Lau eﬀect [see for ex-
ample (Patorski, 1989)]. In the atomic Talbot-Lau eﬀect
two or more MS are used. Doppler dephasing following
the ﬁrst MS washes out the normal Talbot eﬀect, but
subsequent scattering by a second MS can result in a
Doppler rephasing that ultimately leads to a Talbot-like
interference pattern. The dephasing-rephasing process is
analogous to that occurring in the production of pho-
ton echoes (Dubetsky et al., 1984). The atomic Talbot-
Lau eﬀect has been observed recently by Clauser and Li
(1994) using a K beam scattered by MS. The incident
beam is not separated into nonoverlapping beams in the
Talbot-Lau eﬀect, but the origin of the interference pat-
tern can still be traced to matter-wave interference since
it is related to Fresnel diﬀraction.

D. Classical Scattering

It is worthwhile at this point to return to the classical
shadow eﬀect. The shadow eﬀect in a collimated beam is
obvious; the atomic grating produced by the MS simply
propagates in space over a distance in which diﬀraction
can be ignored (L/LT ≪ 1). If one has an ensemble of
atoms incident on a MS from diﬀerent angles, each veloc-
ity subgroup creates its own grating. Just after passing
through the MS, all the gratings are the same, having the
proﬁle of the MS. Downstream from the MS, the atomic
gratings corresponding to diﬀerent velocity classes move
in diﬀerent directions (two of them are shown in Fig.1b).
The grating of the ensemble as a whole is washed out at
a distance ˜ℓ from the MS, provided that

For

˜ℓθb ≥ d.

Lθb ≫ d,

(16)

(17)

the shadow of the atomic grating is washed out well be-
fore reaching the screen or any subsequent MS in the
experimental setup.

There are two ways to view the washing out of the
grating. As discussed above, the washing out is a result
of the diﬀerent classical trajectories of the atoms. An

alternative view allows one to relate this phenomenon to
that encountered in optical coherent transients. Imagine
that the incident beam consists of a number of velocity
subgroups, having vx ≡ v ∼ uθb. When the atoms are
scattered by a MS having a transmission function χ1(x),
the atomic density immediately following the grating is
proportional to χ1(x). Downstream from the MS, the
atomic grating in the x-direction simply propagates with
velocity v, leading to a density distribution that varies
as χ1(x − vt), where t = y/u and y is the distance from
the grating. If this density distribution is expanded in a
Fourier series, one ﬁnds terms in the sum that vary as
cos[nk(x − vt)], where n is an integer. In this picture,
particles in velocity subgroup v acquire a Doppler phase
(7a) of order

φD ∼ kvt ∼ θbL/d ≫ 1,

(18)

as they propagate a distance of order L from the MS.
The decay of the macroscopic grating is analogous to the
free-induction-decay of the macroscopic polarization of a
Doppler-broadened atomic vapor following excitation by
an optical pulse. In this approach, one can draw on many
processes that are well known in the theory of optical co-
herent transients.

Although the atomic grating is washed out following
the interaction with the MS, it is possible to restore the
original macroscopic atomic grating by placing a second
MS between the ﬁrst MS and the screen. This eﬀect has
been observed recently by Batelaan et al. (1996) using a
metastable Ar beam. In the classical trajectory picture,
the restoration of the grating corresponds to a Moir´e pat-
tern. In the Doppler dephasing picture, the restoration
is analogous to the dephasing-rephasing process that oc-
curs for a photon echo. The ﬁrst MS starts a dephasing
process for the diﬀerent velocity subgroups and the sec-
ond MS results in a rephasing process (see below, section
IV. A). At a particular focal plane, where the rephasing
is complete, a macroscopic grating appears. For

L ≪ LT

(19)

eﬀects relating to quantization of the atomic center-of-
mass motion play no role [1].

If L ∼ LT , one has to include recoil eﬀects. Gratings
appearing in this regime are usually associated with the
Talbot-Lau eﬀect, i. e. with the interference of light for
the optical case or quantum interference of matter waves
in the case of the atomic Talbot-Lau eﬀect. It is shown
in Sec. V, however, that the position of the focal planes
and gratings’ periods are often the same as in the classi-
cal case. From this point of view, the Talbot-Lau eﬀect
is a quantum generalization of the shadow eﬀect.

In summary, one can conclude that interference is
qualitatively diﬀerent for collimated beams and beams
with large angular divergence. For collimated beams
(θbL ≪ d) one has two interesting regimes,

5

L ∼ LT

[ωk t ∼ 1]

and

L/LT ≫ D/d

[ωkt ≫ D/d] ,

(20)

(20a)

corresponding to Fresnel (Talbot eﬀect) and Fraunhofer
diﬀraction (nonoverlapping scattered beams), respec-
tively. For beams having angular divergence θbL ≫ d,
the Fresnel and Fraunhofer diﬀraction patterns would
wash out following a single MS. Restoration of the atomic
gratings in this limit can be achieved using two or more
MS. Distances L ∼ LT correspond to the atomic Talbot-
Lau eﬀect and distances

L ≪ LT

ωkt ≪ 1

(21)

correspond to the classical shadow eﬀect.

III. TALBOT EFFECT

A. Talbot eﬀect as a recoil eﬀect.

In this section we show that the Talbot eﬀect is a con-
sequence of the recoil an atom undergoes when it passes
through a microfabricated structure (MS). We assume
that the MS is located in the plane y = 0, normal to
the direction of propagation of the atomic beam. The
MS consists of an inﬁnite number of slits oriented in
the z−direction; as such, only the x−dependence of the
atomic wave function changes when atoms pass through
the slits. Atomic motion in the y−direction can be con-
sidered as classical in nature provided that λdB/d ≪ 1,
but motion along the x-axis must be quantized. In this
section, it is assumed that the incident beam is strongly
collimated, θb ≪ d/L, where d is the period of the MS
and L is the distance from the MS to the screen. As such,
we can neglect any spread in the transverse velocities in
the initial beam and consider all atoms to be incident
with transverse momentum p = 0.

After passing through the MS, the wave function for

an atom is given by

ψ(x) = η(x),

(22)

where η(x) is the amplitude transmission function asso-
ciated with the MS. In the momentum representation,
ψ(x) can be written as a superposition of states having
momenta p = m¯hk, where m is an integer and k = 2π/d.
Explicitly, one ﬁnds that the Fourier transform of ψ(x)
is given by

˜ψ(p) = √2π¯hXm

ηmδ(p − m¯hk),

(23)

where

ηm =Z dx

d

e−imkxη(x)

(24)

is a Fourier coeﬃcient. Unless indicated otherwise, all
sums run from −∞ to +∞. The terms with m 6= 0 in
Eq. (23) can be associated with atomic scattering at an-
gles m¯hk/py, where py is the longitudinal momentum in
the atomic beam. It is assumed that py is constant for all
atoms in the beam - this restriction is relaxed in Sec. VI.
In analogy with electron scattering from a standing wave
ﬁeld [Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect (Kapitza and Dirac, 1933)] or
atomic scattering from a resonant standing wave ﬁeld
[resonant Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect (Kazantsev et al., 1980)],
the scattering from the MS can be interpreted as aris-
ing from the recoil the atoms undergo when they acquire
m¯hk of momenta by scattering from the MS.

The classical motion of the atoms in the y-direction

associates a distance y with a time

t = y/u,

(25)

where u = py/M and M is the atomic mass. For a given
u, the momentum space wave function evolves as

˜ψ(p, t) = e−iǫpt/¯h ˜ψ(p)

= √2π¯hXm

ηm exp[−im2ωkt]δ(p − m¯hk),

(26)

where ǫp = p2/2M is the kinetic energy of an atom hav-
ing center of mass momentum p, and ωk = ¯hk2/2M is a
recoil frequency. In the coordinate representation

ψ(x, t) =Z ∞

−∞

dp

(27)

one ﬁnds

ψ(x, t) =Xm

ηm exp[imkx − im2φt],

where the Talbot phase is deﬁned by

φt = ωkt.

(28)

(29)

Superposition of the diﬀerent terms in Eq. (28) leads

to a spatial modulation of the atomic density

f (x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2 .

(30)

The interference terms in Eq.
(30) are a direct mani-
festation of matter-wave interference. One can see that,
as a function of the time of ﬂight t = y/u, the wave
function (28) undergoes oscillations on a time scale ω−1
k .
As a consequence, the atomic spatial distribution (30)
contains quantum beats at frequencies (m2 − n2)ωk, for
integral m, n. Such quantum beats have been predicted
by Chebotayev et al. (1985) and observed by Chapman
et al. (1995).

It follows from Eq.(28) that the atomic wave function
coincides with the amplitude transmission function of the
MS when

ψ(x, φt) = (1/d)Z x

x−d

η(x′)Z(x − x′, φt)dx′,

(35)

where

t = tT ≡ 2π/ωk.

At this time, atoms are found in the focal plane at

y = LT = utT = 2d2/λdB,

(31)

(32)

Z(x, φt) =Xm

exp(cid:2)−im2φt + imkx(cid:3) .

(36)

In the following discussion, we calculate ψ(x, φt =
2πy/LT ) at fractions of the Talbot length, that is, for

and a self-image of the MS is produced. In general one
ﬁnds that the atomic wave function is a periodic function
of the Talbot phase φt having period 2π, a periodic func-
tion of the time t having period 2π/ωk, and a periodic
function of the distance y having period LT .

The self-imaging of a periodic structure is well known
in classical optics as the Talbot eﬀect. To describe this
eﬀect, one usually starts from the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ equa-
tion

ψ(x) =

1

√iλdBy Z ∞

−∞

dx′η(x′) exp(cid:2)ikdB(x − x′)2/2y(cid:3) ,

(33)

which is written here in the parabolic approximation. To
establish an equivalence between Eqs.(33) and (28), one
can substitute the Fourier expansion of the function η(x′)
in Eq.(33), carry out the integration, and express y in
terms of t.

It is possible to derive a useful symmetry property for
f (x, t) when the transmission function η(x) is real, as it
is for the MS. For real η(x), there is pure amplitude mod-
ulation of the atomic wave function and ηm = η∗
−m. It
then follows from Eqs. (28) and (30) that the atomic spa-
tial distribution is invariant under inversion with respect
to the plane y = LT /2, i. e.

f (x, t)|φt

= f (x, t)|2π−φt

f (x, t) = f (x, tT − t)

f (x, t)|y = f (x, t)|LT −y .

(34)

(34a)

(34b)

Thus, one need calculate f (x, t) in the range 0 ≤ y ≤
LT /2 to obtain the distribution for all y.

B. Calculation of the atomic density proﬁle

We have seen that, for a suﬃciently collimated atomic
beam, self-imaging of a MS occurs at integral multiples
of the Talbot length. To analyze the diﬀraction pattern
for arbitrary y, it is convenient to use Eqs. (24) and (28)
to reexpress the atomic wave-function as the convolution
(Winthrop and Worthington, 1965)

or, equivalently, for

y = LT /n,

φt = 2π/n,

(37)

(38)

where n is a positive integer.

When n = 2, one can show that the diﬀraction pattern
is a self-image of the MS, shifted by half a period. For
n = 2, φt = π, and

Z(x, π) =(cid:0)1 − eikx(cid:1)Xq

e2iqkx.

(39)

Using the equality

one ﬁnds

Xq

eiqα ≡ 2πXs

δ(α − 2πs),

Z(x, π) = d Xodd s

δ(cid:18)x − s

d

2(cid:19) .

(40)

(41)

For the integration range in Eq. (35), only the s = 1
term contributes when Eq. (41) is substituted into Eq.
(35), leading to

ψ(x, π) = η(cid:18)x −

d

2(cid:19) ,

(42)

i. e. at half-integral multiples of the Talbot length, there
are self images of the MS shifted by half a period.

For arbitrary n, it is convenient to write

m = nq + r,

(43)

where 0 ≤ r ≤ n − 1 and q and r are integers. It then
follows that
exp(cid:0)−im2φt(cid:1) = exp(−2πim2/n) ≡ exp(cid:0)−i2πr2/n(cid:1) .

(45a)

The atomic wave function (35) is then given by

To simplify the expression for the coeﬃcients as(n),
one can use an alternative approach for evaluating
Z (x, φt) (Winthrop and Worthington, 1965). The sum
in Eq. (36) can be written in the form

ψ(x, 2π/n) =

(46)

Z (x, φt) =

The meaning of this equation is clear. At distances
y = LT /n , the wave function consists of n self-images of
the amplitude transmission function η(x), having diﬀer-
ent amplitudes as(n) (some of which might vanish) and
spaced from one another by the distance d/n. For ap-
propriately chosen η(x) and n (see below), the atomic
density (30) associated with the wave-function (46) is a
periodic function of x having period

2π Xq Z dmdf
× exp(cid:2)−if (q − m) − im2φt + imkx(cid:3) .

(48)

Carrying out the integration over m, summation over q
[using Eq. (40)] and integration over f, one arrives at

Z(x, φt) =r π

Thus, the Talbot-eﬀect can be used to generate spatial
modulation of an atomic beam having a period which is a
fraction of the period of the MS. We refer to such proﬁles
as ”higher order atomic gratings.”

zr(x, φt) = exphi (kx + 2πr)2 /4φti .

At distances y = LT /n one ﬁnds

(51)

C. Higher-order gratings using the Talbot eﬀect

Three diﬀerent situations can be distinguished

One can conclude from Eq. (46) that, owing to matter-
wave interference, the transmission function η(x) im-
printed on the atomic wave function by the MS can be
copied n times in the plane y = LT /n, with each copy
separated by d/n. This eﬀect occurs for arbitrary trans-
mission functions and can be used to generate higher or-
der atomic gratings.

Since the as(n) appearing in Eq. (46) are not necessar-
ily equal, the wave function (46) is periodic with period
d, but not necessarily with period dg < d. Moreover, it is
possible for the diﬀerent copies corresponding to diﬀer-
ent s to overlap. We refer to a pure, higher order atomic
grating as one in which the diﬀerent grating images do
not overlap and for which dg < d. When the width f d of
the slits in the MS is smaller than spacing d/n, diﬀerent
terms in the wave-function (46) do not overlap with one
another and one ﬁnds for the atomic density (30)

8

1. n = 2m + 1
2. n = 2(2m + 1)
3. n = 4m

(54)

for integers m ≥ 0.

In the ﬁrst case |as(n)| = 1√n , independent of s. At
distances y = LT /3, y = LT /5, . . ., pure, higher order
atomic gratings having periods dg = d/3, d/5 . . . are
produced.

In the second case |as(n)| = 0 for s even and |as(n)| =
q 2
n , independent of s, for s odd. In the plane y = LT /2
the atomic grating is shifted by a half-period d/2 from the
initial grating (as found above); in the plane y = LT /6
only terms located at x = d
6 in Eq. (52) con-
tribute to the sum (for 0 ≤ x < d), corresponding to an
atomic grating having period dg = d/3, that is shifted
by a distance d/6 from the initial grating. In general in
the focal plane y = LT /[2 (2m + 1)], one ﬁnds an atomic

2 , 5d

grating having period dg = d/ (2m + 1) which is shifted
by a distance d/[2 (2m + 1)] from the initial grating.

FIG. 3. One period of the atomic density spatial modula-
tion in the planes located at the distances y = LT /m (m = 1,
. . . 16). The case of the atomic beam modulation with micro-
fabricated structure having transmission step-function (56)
with relative width f = 0.16 is shown. While expected period
dg of the beam self-image greater than slits’ width σ = df,
one obtains higher-order spatial gratings.

n ,

The atomic density proﬁle can no longer be written in

the form (52) when

f d > dg.

(55)

In this limit, diﬀerent components in the wave-function
(46) overlap and can interfere with one another in form-
ing the atomic density. Even though the atomic distribu-
tion function can still contain narrow peaks having a size
of order of dg, the amplitudes of the peaks are not equal,
and the period of the overall diﬀraction pattern reverts
to the period d of the initial grating.

These diﬀerent regimes are illustrated in Fig. 3 plot-
ted for an amplitude transmission function deﬁned in the
interval 0 ≤ x < d as

η(x) =(cid:26) 1, for 0 ≤ x ≤ df

0, for df < x < d

.

(56)

The Talbot eﬀect enables one to create pure, higher-order
atomic gratings having periods that are limited only by
the slit widths in the MS.

In the previous section, it was assumed that the an-
gular divergence θb of the incident beam was less than
d/LT . If this inequality is not satisﬁed, the diﬀraction
patterns associated with diﬀerent velocity subgroups in
the incident atomic beam result in a washing out of the
overall diﬀraction pattern. For typical beam parameters,
this condition restricts θb to be less than 10−5−10−4 rad.
The restriction on θb is a limiting factor on the maxi-
mum ﬂux of the atomic beam.
It is possible to avoid
this restriction and increase the atomic ﬂux if echo-like
techniques are used.

Using echo techniques that are analogous to those en-
countered in the study of coherent transients, one can
observe matter-wave interference in beams having a large
angular divergence (Dubetsky et al., 1984). It turns out,
however, that the dephasing and rephasing of the atomic
gratings which occurs in such schemes does not depend in
any critical manner on quantization of the atomic center-
of-mass motion. In other words, the dephasing-rephasing
mechanism is the same whether or not L ∼ LT (Talbot
eﬀect) or L ≪ LT (classical limit). As such, it makes
sense to consider the limit of classical scattering ﬁrst,
since the analysis is easier and a simple geometric in-
terpretation can be given to the results (Dubetsky and
Berman, 1994). Thus, we consider the limit L ≪ LT in
this section and defer a discussion of the case L ∼ LT
until Sec. V.
In this and the following section we consider the inter-
action of an atomic beam with two MS, separated by a
distance L. The angular divergence of the incident beam
is suﬃciently large to satisfy the inequality

θb ≫ d/L.

(57)

The ﬁrst MS produces a sum of atomic gratings, one for
each velocity subgroup in the initial atomic beam. Imme-
diately following the MS, these gratings overlap and mir-
ror the transmission function of the grating, but down-
stream from the MS, they dephase relative to one an-
other. As a result, the macroscopic atomic grating is
washed out at a distance

˜ℓ ∼ d/θb ≪ L

(58)

from the MS.

Although the macroscopic grating produced by the
ﬁrst MS washes out in a distance of order ˜ℓ ≪ L, it
is possible for the second MS to lead to a restoration of
the atomic gratings. For particles moving on classical
trajectories, we refer to this process as a shadow eﬀect
since it can be interpreted completely by the ”shadow”
of the incident beam formed by the two MS (Chebotayev
et al., 1985) (see Fig. 4).

FIG. 4. Shadow eﬀect, geometric simulation. Atomic
beam having large angular divergence (θb = 120◦) passes
through two separated MSs having the same periods
d1 = d2 = d, duty cycles f1 = 0.5 and f2 = 0.05 and
separated on the distance L. Grating carved by ﬁrst MS is
washed out on the distance ℓ ∼ d. Other gratings between
MSs (0 < y < L) are ﬁctive, they appeared because only
trajectories for atoms passed through both MSs are shown.
Gratings after the second MS (y > L) are real, they appear
owing to echo eﬀect.

For a beam having large angular divergence (θb ∼ 1),
the initial grating produced by the ﬁrst MS washes out
in a distance comparable with the MS’s period, in accor-
dance with Eq. (58). After passing through the second
MS, however, macroscopic gratings reappear in speciﬁc
focal planes. A grating having the same period as the MS
is focused in the focal plane y = 2L, while higher-order
gratings having periods d/n (for integer n) are focused at
other locations (to be determined below). The shadow
eﬀect can also be demonstrated easily using incoherent
light (Chebotayev, 1986).

Although the shadow eﬀect occurs for classical parti-
cles, it can be interpreted in terms of a dephasing and
rephasing of atomic gratings. The relevant phases are
the Doppler phases associated with various Fourier com-
ponents of the atomic density, as discussed in the In-
troduction.
In such a picture, the ﬁnal image on the
screen depends on a cancellation of Doppler phases in
the spatial regions 0 → L and L → 2L, for example. In
other words, the signal is sensitive to the relative Doppler
phases in two spatial regions and is a measure of this
relative phase.
Insofar as interferometers are measures
of relative phase, the echo-like rephasing of the atomic
gratings can be viewed as a manifestation of atom in-
terferometry. On the other hand, this rephasing is not
related to the wave nature of matter. A shadow eﬀect

10

interferometer of this type was used by Batelaan et al.
(1996) to measure the displacement of atomic gratings
produced by rotation and by gravity.

The same type of Doppler dephasing and rephasing
that occurs using MS can also occur when atoms in-
teract with two or more nearly resonant standing wave
ﬁelds (Baklanov et al., 1976; Barger et. al., 1979; Dubet-
sky, 1976; Chebotayev, 1978; Chebotayev et al., 1978a,
LeGou¨et and Berman, 1979; Mossberg et al., 1979; Du-
betsky and Semibalamut, 1982; Bord´e, 1989; Dubetsky
and Berman, 1994). When standing wave optical ﬁelds
are used for modulation of the atomic spatial distribu-
tion, the atomic gratings often are monitored by applying
a probe pulse in the focal planes that transfers the phase
associated with an atomic state population to one asso-
ciated with an atomic coherence. Atom interferometers
of this type have been used for precision measurements
of gravitational (Kasevich and Chu, 1991) and inertial
(Riehle et al., 1991) phenomena [for a review, see (M¨uller
et al., 1995)]. In these cases, external ﬁelds give rise to a
displacement of the atomic gratings.

A. Dephasing-rephasing processes using two

spatially separated MS

Before calculating the particles’ distribution function,
we derive some general properties of grating formation.
In this subsection, it is convenient to make a Fourier
decomposition of the atomic density proﬁle in the x-
direction. The propagation of each of the Fourier com-
ponents is then treated separately.

Consider the case when the two MS (1 and 2) have
periods d1 and d2 and are separated from one another
by a distance L. A MS forms a periodic spatial distribu-
tion (shadow) which is the same for all atomic velocity
subgroups just after passing through the MS. The proﬁle
created by the ﬁrst MS contains a sum of harmonics in
the x−direction having spatial periods

dm1 = d/ |m1| ,

(59)

where m1 is an integer. Immediately following the MS,
the m1th spatial harmonic varies as cos(m1k1x), where
k1 = 2π/d1 is the wave-number associated with the ﬁrst
MS. As the atoms move downstream from the ﬁrst MS,
the m1th harmonic acquires a Doppler phase (7a) given
by

φm1 (t) = m1k1vt,

(60)

where v is the x-component of atomic velocity and t =
y/u as before. For a time

td ∼ 1/(k1v)

(61)

the Doppler phases becomes large, φm1 (t) >
the macroscopic grating washes out on averaging over

∼ 1, and

v. Since v ∼ uθb, the time td (61) corresponds to the
distance ˜ℓ (58).

(t)

The atoms pass through the second MS at time T =
L/u (y = L). Downstream from the second MS, each spa-
tial harmonic acquires an additional phase (i.e., a phase
in addition to φm1 (t), which, itself, continues to increase
following the second MS)

φm2 (t) = m2k2v(t − T ),

(62)

where m2 is another integer. Since the mask created by
the second MS is superimposed on the shadow from the
ﬁrst MS, the resulting shadow consists of harmonics hav-
ing wave numbers

kh = |m1k1 + m2k2|

(63)

and velocity-dependent Doppler phases

φ (t) = φm1 (t) + φm2 (t) .

FIG. 5. A dephasing-rephasing process responsible for the
atomic grating focusing at the focal plane y = m
n L produced
by two MSs having periods d1 and d2 and associated wave
numbers k1 and k2, such as jk1 = ℓk2, where j and ℓ are inte-
grals. When atomic beam passes through ﬁrst MS a number
of harmonics having wave numbers m1k1 (harmonics m1k1)
are induced. Mask, consisting of harmonics m2k2, is superim-
posed on the atomic spatial proﬁle when beam passes through
second MS. Dephasing of the relevant harmonic j(m − n)k1
occurs between MSs. Second MS starts rephasing process for
harmonic j(m − n)k1 − ℓmk2 = −jnk1 which leads to the
phase cancellation at the echo-point t = m
n T, where macro-
scopic atomic grating is focused. Other harmonics contribut-
ing to this grating must have wave numbers q-times larger,
where q is integral. Their phase diagrams diﬀer from plotted
only by scaling the phase in q−times.

The two phases in the rhs of this equation can cancel one
another at the so-called echo time te deﬁned by

[To satisfy Eq. (65), the integers m1 and m2 must have
opposite signs (for the sake of illustration, we take m1 as
negative in the examples given below)].

We assume that the ratio of the MS’s periods is ratio-

φ (te) = 0,

(65)

nal,

corresponding to a focal plane ye = ute. At such times,
one produces an harmonic in the atomic density that is
independent of v; as a consequence this grating survives
any averaging over the velocity distribution in the inci-
dent beam. From Eq. (65) one sees gratings are focused
when

te/T = ye/L =

(66)

d1/d2 = k2/k1 = j/ℓ,

(67)

where j and ℓ are the smallest positive integers which can
be used to satisfy this equation. In this case an inﬁnite
number of harmonics associated with pairs (m1, m2) ,
having the same ratio m1
, contribute at a given focal
m2
plane. It follows from Eqs. (66, 67) that for

From Eq. (63), one ﬁnds that harmonics having

are focused in this plane.

For example, consider the limiting case in which d1 =
d2 ≡ d (j = ℓ = 1), analogous to the situation stud-
In the plane
ied by Dubetsky and Berman (1994).
y = 2L (m/n = 2), all harmonics having m2/m1 = −2
(i.e. {m1, m2} = {−1, 2};{−2, 4};{−3, 6};etc) are fo-
cused. As a result [see Eq.
(63)], harmonics having
kh = k, 2k, 3k,etc, are focused in the plane y = 2L.
The period of this atomic grating dg corresponds to
the smallest value of kh, namely dg = 2π/k = d.
Similarly,
in the plane y = 3L/2 (m/n = 3/2), all
harmonics having m2/m1 = −3 (i.e.
{m1, m2} =
{−1, 3};{−2, 6};{−3, 9};etc) are focused. As a result [see
Eq. (63)], harmonics having kh = 2k, 4k, 6k,etc, are fo-
cused in the plane y = (3/2)L. The period of this atomic
grating is dg = 2π/2k = d/2. For m = (n + 1), one ﬁnds
that atomic gratings having period dg = d/n are focused
in the plane y = [(n + 1)/n]L.

To treat the case of arbitrary, rational d1/d2 = j/ℓ, we

set

m1 = −¯j(m − n)q, m2 = ¯ℓmq,

(72)

where q is an integer,

¯j = j/µ,

¯ℓ = ℓ/µ,

(73)

and µ is the largest common factor of j(m − n) and ℓm.

(76)

One concludes that it is possible to create a higher
order atomic grating, having a period that is ¯jn−times
smaller than that of the ﬁrst MS, by passing an atomic
beam having a large angular divergence through two
MS. Although both the Talbot and shadow eﬀects lead
to higher order atomic gratings, there is a qualitative
diﬀerence between the two cases. In the Talbot eﬀect,
the structure of the MS is copied n times in the image
plane y = LT /n, giving rise to a proﬁle having period

dg = d1/n or 2d1/n, provided that dg > f1d1. The mini-
mum period is determined by the slit width. In contrast,
the period of the atomic grating produced by the shadow
eﬀect in the plane ye = m
n L is given by Eq. (76) and
is not limited by the slit widths of the MS (although
the contrast is determined by the slit widths). The pe-
riod of the atomic grating is equal to d1/¯j in the focal
plane ye = 2L and is compressed by a factor n in the
plane ye = m
n L. This compression lies at the heart of the
shadow eﬀect’s application to atomic lithography (Du-
betsky and Berman, 1994). Atomic gratings having peri-
ods smaller than those of both the MS and even smaller
than the slit widths of the MS can be obtained. In this
respect the shadow eﬀect has yet an additional advan-
tage over the Talbot-eﬀect, where higher order grating
production is not accompanied by compression.

Before proceeding to calculate the atomic density dis-
tribution, we should like to estimate the depth of focus of
the various gratings. The distances between focal planes
are comparable with the distance L between the MS. One
can estimate the depth of focus ˜ℓg from the requirement
that the phase (64) be smaller than unity in the region
of the focal plane. For mi given by (72) one ﬁnds

φ (t) = qkgvδy/u,

(77)

where δy = (y − m
n L) = (y − ye) in the neighborhood of
the focal plane at y = m
n L. Setting q = 1, φ(t) ∼ 1 and
δy = ˜ℓg, and using Eq. (75) and the fact that θb ∼ v/u,
one obtains

˜ℓg ∼

˜ℓ
n¯j ≤ ˜ℓ,

(78)

where ˜ℓ is given by (58) with d = d1. Since L ≫ ˜ℓ has
been assumed, it is possible to separate the various grat-
ings. The sharpening of depth of focus of the higher order
gratings predicted by Eq. (78) is in qualitative agreement
with the results shown in Fig. 4.

B. Particles’ distribution proﬁle

We now turn our attention to a calculation of the
atomic density proﬁle. In contrast to the Talbot eﬀect,
it is not possible to ﬁnd self-imaging using the shadow
eﬀect, since the scattering coeﬃcients for the diﬀerent
spatial harmonics are not the same. Let the transmission
functions for the two MS be denoted by χs(x) (s = 1 or
2) [χs(x) is a transmission function for atomic density,
while ηs(x) is a transmission function for atomic state
amplitudes - for MS having transmission of either 1 or
0, these functions are identical]. Atoms are scattered by
the MS in the planes y = 0 and y = L, or, equivalently,
at times T1 = 0 and T2 = T = L/u. Calculations are
carried out using t = y/u as a variable. In some sense,

12

this corresponds to working in the atomic rest frame. As
a result of scattering, the atomic density is modiﬁed as

f (x, v, T +

s ) = χs(x)f (x, v, T −s ),

(79)

where T ±s are times just after or before a scattering event.
Following the scattering event, the distribution evolves as

f (x, v, t) = f [x − v(t − Ts), v, T +
s ].

(80)

We assume that, for t < 0, the atoms are distributed

homogeneously in the transverse direction, i.e.

f (x, v, t)|t<0 = 1.

(81)

The assumption of a homogeneous velocity distribution
is consistent with a beam having angular divergence (57),
since in this limit, the transverse velocity distribution is
approximately constant over the range ds/L. The spatial
distribution of the atomic density for t > T is given by

f (x, t) = hχ1(x − vt)χ2[x − v(t − T )]i ,

(82)

where h. . .i represents an average over velocities. Ex-
panding χs (x) in a Fourier series

χs(x) =Xm

χ(s)
m eimksx,

(83)

where ks = 2π/ds is the ”wave-number” of structure s,
one ﬁnds

where φ (t), as deﬁned by Eq. (64), is also a function
of m and n. Owing to condition (57), for t ∼ T ∼ L/u
and v ∼ uθb, the phase factor in the brackets of Eq. (84)
is large, of order Lθb/ds ≫ 1. On averaging over veloc-
ities, one ﬁnds a nonvanishing contribution only at the
particular focal planes or echo-times given by Eq. (65).
Retaining contributions from only those mi given by
(72) corresponding to the various focal planes, one ﬁnds
from Eq. (84) that the atomic density in the focal planes
is given by

f (x, te) =Xq

χ(1)
¯j(n−m)qχ(2)

¯ℓmq exp(iqkgx),

(85)

where kg is the wave number of the focused atomic grat-
ing given in Eq. (75). Thus, owing to the shadow eﬀect,
at the echo-time (69) an atomic grating is focused having
period

dg = 2π/kg = d1/(¯jn).

(86)

Note that the period of this grating is n¯j times smaller
than the period of the ﬁrst microfabricated structure.

To reexpress the density function at the focal planes in
terms of the transmission functions, we write the Fourier
harmonic amplitude χ(j)

grating period, one has to choose ℓ = j = 1 and m = n+1
(¯ℓ = ¯j = 1), which corresponds to the focal planes
y = 2L (n = 1), y = 3/2L (n = 2), y = 4/3L (n = 3) . . . ,
where gratings having periods dg = d1/n are focused. To
satisfy condition (103), one can choose

A = 1/[2(n + 1)].

at the diﬀerent focal planes. Chosen case is optimum for
5−order grating focused at the plane ye = 6
5 L. This grat-
ing has amplitude A = 1
12 and twice large background term.
The amplitude of this grating is not less than amplitudes of
the lower-order gratings focused at the other planes for given
duty cycles.

To achieve this maximum signal, one must use slits
in the second microfabricated structure whose width is
smaller than the atomic grating period (f2d2 = d1/2(n +
1) ≤ dg = d1/n). Using the shadow-eﬀect technique, one
can also observe atomic gratings having the same ampli-
tude (107) whose period is smaller than the slit width,
but some background term appears for these gratings.
Indeed, if f2 = 2q+1
2(n+1) , ℓ = j = 1, m = n + 1 (leading to
{α}F = 1/2, β = 1/2), for positive integers q ≤ n, then
Eq. (103) still holds and provides the grating amplitude
(107), but the background term is q times larger than the
grating amplitude.

For illustration we plot in Fig. 6 the grating pro-
ﬁles at diﬀerent focal planes ye = n+1
n L (n = 1, . . . 5)
for MS having the same periods d1 = d2, and duty cy-
cles f1 = 1

5th order grating is optimized and f2 ≃ 0.5, the am-
plitudes of the gratings that are focused in the planes
ye = n+1
n L (n = 1, . . . 4) are less than or equal to the
amplitude of the 5th order grating. This feature is seen
in Fig. 6.

The geometric simulation introduced above allows one

also be used to provide some quantitative results. For
example, one ﬁnds from Eqs. (101, 102) that the shadow
eﬀect disappears at the focal plane y = 2L if both MS
have the same period (d1 = d2 = d) and duty cycles,
f1 = f2 = 0.5. In this case, m = 2, n = j = ℓ = 1,
and, from Eq.
(96b), one ﬁnds that α = 1, β = 0.5.
From Eq. (101a) one ﬁnds that S (w) ≡ 0; there is no
atomic grating. The reason for the absence of the grating
under these conditions is evident from Fig. 7.

it is proportional to the length of the bold part of A′B ′,

Consequently, any variation of the particles’ distribution at
the focal plane y = 2L disappears.

The geometric picture can also be used to explain
the absence of background terms at the focal planes
y = n+1
n L produced by MS having duty cycles (106)
and equal periods (d1 = d2 = d). One can see from Eq.
(102, 104) that the background disappears because there

presented in Fig. 8.

V. TALBOT-LAU EFFECT

When the spatial separation of the MS is increased to

the point where

L ∼ LT = 2d2/λdB,

(109)

it is no longer possible to neglect quantization of the
atomic center-of-mass in calculating the transverse mo-
tion of the atoms. Just as in the Talbot eﬀect, the recoil
an atom undergoes on scattering from a grating must
be taken into account. It turns out, however, that the
Doppler dephasing and rephasing encountered in analyz-
ing the problem of classical scattering by MS still can
be given a classical interpretation when L ∼ LT , pro-
vided that the angular divergence of the incident beam
is suﬃciently large, θb ≫ d/LT = λdB/d = θd. In other
words, even though we must account for quantization
of the atoms’ center-of-mass motion, eﬀects related to
Doppler dephasing (which are automatically included in
a quantized motion approach) are unchanged from the
classical case.

We have already alluded to this result in the Introduc-
tion. Recall that matter-wave interference results from
the overlap on the screen of atomic wave functions asso-
ciated with states having center-of-mass momenta p and
p + n¯hk. The relative dephasing between these states
(7) contains a Doppler part (7a) and a quantum part

16

(7b). Since the washing out and restoration of the macro-
scopic atomic gratings is connected with an averaging
over atomic velocities v, one expects that the Doppler
part, proportional to v, is responsible for the dephasing-
rephasing eﬀect. This contribution is actually classical
in nature (i. e.
it does not vanish in the limit ¯h → 0)
and enters the calculations whether or not the quantum
contribution to the phase has to be considered. As a con-
sequence, the dephasing-rephasing process is the same for
the classical shadow eﬀect and the quantum Talbot-Lau
eﬀect. It turns out, however, that for separations of the
MS equal to a rational multiple of the Talbot length,
the Talbot eﬀect can actually result in a decrease of the
period of the atomic gratings from those periods which
would result from the classical shadow eﬀect result. The
decrease in period occurs for MS consisting of open slits
and opaque strips; it would not occur, for example, in
resonant standing wave ﬁelds.

Since the Doppler dephasing determines the position of
the focal planes and the period of the atomic grating, one
can carry over the results Eqs. (69, 70, 76) obtained in
Sec. IV for the shadow eﬀect. In this section, we are in-
terested in the variation of the atomic gratings in a given
focal plane as a function of the separation of the MS. In
other words, we look for those separations L for which
the Talbot eﬀect signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the gratings that
would have been produced by the shadow eﬀect alone.
This is analogous to photon echo studies of atomic re-
laxation in which the echo amplitude is monitored as a
function of the separation between the excitation pulses.
It should be noted that the Talbot-Lau eﬀect has been
studied using light by Clauser and Reinsch (1992) for the
parameters

common factor of j(m − n) and ml] and a grating pe-
riod dg = d1. The atomic Talbot-Lau eﬀect was demon-
strated by Clauser and Li (1994) using K atoms for the

oretical study of the atomic Talbot-Lau eﬀect was also
carried out for the parameters (111) by Carnal et al.
(1995). The conclusions as to the period and location
of the atomic gratings follows from purely classical con-
siderations in this case; there is no need to invoke argu-
ments related to the wave nature of matter (Clauser and
Reinsch, 1992; Clauser and Li, 1994; Carnal et al., 1995).

A. Grating formation

The geometry is the same as that considered for the
classical shadow eﬀect, except that L is no longer re-
stricted to be less than LT . Again, it is convenient to
work in the atomic rest frame deﬁned by t = y/u. As
discussed above, it is necessary to quantize the atomic
motion only in the x-direction. The atoms undergo scat-
tering at the MS at times Ts = Ls/u (T1 = 0, T2 = T =
L/u). For thin gratings, the atomic wave function ψ(x, t)
undergoes jumps at the MS given by

ψ(x, T +

s ) = ηs(x)ψ(x, T −s ),

(112)

where ψ(x, T ±s ) is the wave function on either side of
grating s, ηs(x) is the amplitude transmission function
of grating s, and

χs(x) = |ηs(x)|2

(113)

is the transmission function of grating s [for MS consist-
ing of a series of slits, ηs(x) = χs(x)].

To characterize the atomic beam using a quantized
center-of-mass description, one can use the Wigner dis-
tribution function deﬁned by

In this expression terms having (m1k1 + m2k2) 6= 0 contribute to the atomic gratings. Owing to the assumption of
an incident beam having large angular divergence θb ∼ v/u ≫ d/L, the Doppler phases associated with these terms
oscillate rapidly as a function of p, except in the echo focal planes. As a consequence, the positions and periods of
the atomic gratings are the same as those in the classical shadow eﬀect [see Eqs. (69, 70, 76)]. In the remainder of
this section, we calculate the atomic density in the focal planes ye or, equivalently, at times te = ye/u given in Eqs.
(69, 70).

It is possible to simplify Eq. (120) if we assume that the angular divergence θb of the incident beam is less than
θD = D/L, such that a freely propagating beam would undergo negligible diﬀraction over a distance of order L. For
i of the distribution function appearing in Eq.
p ∼ M uθb ≪ M D/T , one can neglect the dependence on ni and n
(120). Then the sum over ni can be carried out using the formula

is a Talbot phase associated with a speciﬁc focal plane,
and

is the initial spatial distribution in the atomic beam.
Since the beam diameter is much larger than the period
of the gratings,

that, as deﬁned by Eq.(127), there is a diﬀerent Tal-
bot length associated with the signal for diﬀerent focal
planes, ye = (m/n)L. We wish to examine the signal in
a given focal plane as a function of the separation L of
the MS or, equivalently, as a function of φT (m, n).When
L = LT (m, n) [φT (m, n) = 2π] the atomic density (123)
is the same as that of the shadow eﬀect (85).

Using arguments similar to those leading to Eqs. (34),
one can prove that, for pure amplitude modulation of
the wave functions, i. e. for real amplitude transmission
functions ηj(x) = η∗j (x), the dependence of the parti-
cles’ distribution on the Talbot phase is symmetric with
respect to the point φT (m, n) = π [L = LT (m, n)/2],

D ≫ dg

(126)

f (x, te)|φT (m,n) = f (x, te)|2π−φT (m,n) ,

(129)

(130)

one can neglect the variation of f (x) and set f (x) = 1
in Eq. (123).

The distribution function (123) is identical with the
shadow eﬀect result (85), except for the presence of the
Talbot phases. The main features of the dependence of
the atomic density on the Talbot phase in the Talbot-
Lau eﬀect are the same as those for the Talbot eﬀect
considered in Sec. III. The density (123) is an oscillating
function of φT (m, n) having period 2π. If φT (m, n) is in-
creased by 2π, or, equivalently, if the separation between
the MS is increased by LT (m, n), the density distribution
in the corresponding echo plane is unchanged. The Tal-
bot distance associated with a given focal plane is deﬁned
here as

LT (m, n) ≡

2d2

λdB

¯ℓ

¯j2 (m − n)

.

(127)

In terms of LT (m, n), the Talbot phase (124) is equal to

φT (m, n) = 2π[L/LT (m, n)].

(128)

In our notation, the Talbot phase is a function of L,
while the Talbot distance is independent of L. Note

f (x, te)|L = f (x, te)|LT −L .

The question arises as to what values of φT (m, n) lead
to especially interesting results, i. e. atomic gratings
that diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the gratings that would be
produced by the shadow eﬀect. We have found that the
atomic gratings are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the Talbot
eﬀect when the Talbot phase is a rational multiple of 2π,

φT (m, n) = 2π

mT
nT

,

(131)

where mT and nT are positive integers having no com-
mon factors. We proceed to analyze the atomic density
function in the focal planes for separations of the MS cor-
responding to Eq. (131), that is, for L = LT (m, n) mT
nT

For Talbot phases given by Eq. (131), the sum in Eq.
(123) can be divided into nT −1 independent sums having
(132)

q = nT q′ + r

.

where 0 ≤ r ≤ nT . For Talbot phases given by Eq. (131),
any dependence on q′ disappears in the last factor of Eq.
(123), allowing one to rewrite Eq. (123) as

B. Higher-order gratings using the Talbot-Lau

technique

Equation (134) is the basic result of this section.

It
gives the atomic density function in the focal plane for
separation of the MS that corresponds to Talbot phases
which are rational multiples of 2π. For speciﬁed trans-
mission functions, it can be evaluated numerically in focal
planes deﬁned by te = ye/u = (m/n)T = (m/n)L/u for
arbitrary (j/ℓ) = d1/d2 (recall that ¯j = j/µ; ¯ℓ = ℓ/µ,
where µ is the largest common factor of j(m − n) and
ℓm), mT and nT [L = LT (m, n) mT
In this subsec-
nT
tion, we are interested primarily in showing that, owing
to the Talbot eﬀect, periodic atomic density gratings can
be produced whose periods dT are smaller than the cor-
responding periods dg which would have been produced
by the shadow eﬀect.

].

The ﬁrst thing to note is that the function χ1 in Eq.
(134), considered as a function of x, is periodic with pe-
riod

dT = dg/nT ,

(135)

nT−times smaller than the period dg of the shadow-
eﬀect grating. Unfortunately, this does not guarantee
that f (x, te) is periodic with period dT , owing to the
exponential term in Eq. (134). Under the transforma-
tion x → x + dT , the exponential term is multiplied by
the phase-factor

exp (2πir/nT )

(136)

which is a function of the summation index r. If the sum-
mation over r in Eq. (134) somehow was restricted to
r = 0, the atomic grating would have period dT . Re-
stricting the summation to r = 0 can be accomplished by
choosing the amplitude transmission function such that

the product η2(cid:16)x2 − r

nT

d2(cid:17) η∗2(cid:16)x2 + r

nT

d2(cid:17) is nonvan-

ishing only for r = 0. To simplify the discussion, we have
taken mT = 1 [L = LT (m, n)/nT ].

For MS consisting of slits and opaque strips, both the
amplitude transmission functions ηj (x) and transmission
functions χj(x) are equal to the Heaviside step-function

ηj(x) = χj(x) = θ(cid:18)fj −(cid:26) x

dj(cid:27)F(cid:19) ,

Inequality (140) must hold for all r 6= 0 to guarantee that
the atomic grating has period dT = dg/nT . Clearly, in-
equality (140) does not hold for r = nT
2 when nT is even.
While this does not preclude the possibility of higher or-
der gratings for nT even, it does suggest that we consider
the cases of even and odd nT separately.

1. nT odd

In this case, we write

nT = 2n′ + 1,

(141)

where n′ is a positive integer or zero. For the summation
range 0 ≤ r ≤ nT − 1 in Eq. (134), the minimum value
of the rhs of both inequalities (138) and (140) is 1/nT ,
which occurs for r = 1 or r = 2n′ in (138) and r = n′ or
r = n′ + 1 in (140). Thus, provided that

f2 ≤

2n′ + 1

(142)

one can produce atomic gratings having period dT =
dg/(2n′ + 1) in the focal plane y = m
n L for separations
between the MS equal to L = LT
(2n′+1) or, equivalently, for
2π
a Talbot phase (124) equal to

The transmission function χ1 still has period dg/nT =

this period, dT = 2dg/nT = dg/n′. As in the case of odd
nT , one must choose f2 suﬃciently small to eliminate all
but the r′ = 0 terms in the sum to ensure that the atomic
grating has period dT . Inequalities (138) and (140) are
satisﬁed if

more complicated owing to two factors: (i) contributions
hs (w) with s < [β′]I are not independent of w, and (ii)
for s = [β′]I one has to consider separately contributions
from odd and even [α′z − w]I . The situation simpliﬁes
for integer β′, when the θ-factor equals 1 for s < β′ and
0 for s = β′, independent of the values of z, w, and α′.
This is the only limit considered in the subsection. For
integer β′, one can carry out the summation over s in Eq.
(156).

For even β′, when Pβ ′−1

s=0 (−1)s = 0, the gratings are

Since the atomic density is a periodic function of the
distance between the MS having period LT , the depen-
dence of the grating amplitude A at a given focal plane
must also be a periodic function of L having period LT
for a ﬁxed value of the ratio ye/L. One period of A(L)
is shown in Fig. 11 at the focal planes ye = 2L, 3L/2.
This dependence is plotted for values of L equal to ra-
tional multiples of the Talbot length L = mT
LT . One
nT
can not expect the dependence of A (L) to be smooth,
because the transmission function (137) is discontinuous;
even small changes in the ratio mT
can lead to dramatic
nT
changes in the atomic density (134).

C. Comparison of the Talbot and Talbot-Lau eﬀects

Qualitatively, the transition from the shadow eﬀect to
the Talbot-Lau eﬀect for a beam having a large angular
divergence that is scattered by two MS parallels the tran-
sition from spatial modulation to Talbot self-imaging of
a collimated beam that is scattered by a single MS. Sim-
ilarities and diﬀerences of these transitions, which oc-
cur when the characteristic length scale in the problem
changes from L ≪ LT to L ∼ LT , can be summarized as

To make some connection with previous work, we ana-
lyze the atomic density for the parameters of Eq. (111),
corresponding to the Talbot-Lau eﬀect studied theoreti-
cally by Carnal et al. (1995) and realized experimentally
by Clauser and Li (1994). The appropriate parameters

are (cid:8)m, n, j, ℓ, ¯j, ¯ℓ(cid:9) = {2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1/2},

When the distance between the MS is L = LT (2,1)
, cor-
responding to φT = π [the case analyzed by Carnal et

the corresponding values of α′ and β′ obtained from Eqs.
(156) are

α′ = 2f2, β′ = 2f1.

(163)

As in (Carnal et al., 1995), we choose f2 = 1

or f1 = 1
4 . In order to apply the results of Sec. V.B.2, it
is necessary that f2 ≤ 1/nT = 1/2; clearly, this require-
ment is met.

coinciding with the distribution calculated by Carnal et

(1995). To compare this proﬁle with that caused
by the shadow eﬀect, one ﬁnds from Eqs. (102, 101c),
that the shadow eﬀect distribution function is given by
f (x, te)|shadow = f (x − d1
2 , te). Thus, owing to matter-
wave interference, the atomic grating (165) is shifted by
a half-period from the grating that would have been pro-
duced by the shadow eﬀect alone.

In general, the atomic gratings produced when a beam
scatters from two, separated MS cannot be attributed
entirely to quantum eﬀects since the classical shadow
eﬀect contributes to grating formation. If the parame-
ters are chosen in such a way, however, that the classical
shadow eﬀect vanishes, then any atomic gratings that
are formed can be attributed solely to quantum matter-
wave interference. We have already alluded to this result
above. Returning to Eqs. (101, 102), one ﬁnds that the
shadow eﬀect grating S (w) disappears if the parameters

The results of Secs. IV and VI must be averaged over
u once changes in the Talbot phase originating from the
distribution of longitudinal velocities becomes of order
unity. For a thermal beam having a Maxwellian distri-
bution over longitudinal velocities, the averaging can be
carried out using the function tabulated by Kruse and
Ramsey (1951). For other distributions numerical inte-
gration is needed. Such calculations are not included in
this contribution.

VI. TALBOT AND TALBOT–LAU EFFECTS IN A

THERMAL ATOMIC BEAM.

Up to this point, all eﬀects related to a distribution
of longitudinal velocities u in the atomic beam have
been neglected. Averaging over u is not important for
the shadow eﬀect since the focal planes are located at
ye = (m/n)L, independent of u.
In both the Talbot
and Talbot-Lau eﬀects, the Talbot phase depends on the
Talbot length LT = 2d2/λdB, which, in turn, is pro-
portional to u owing to the presence of the De Broglie
wavelength. To achieve the maximum contrast in the
Talbot and Talbot-Lau eﬀects, it is necessary to longi-
tudinally cool the atomic beam (Clauser and Li, 1994).

FIG. 13. An origin of the Talbot eﬀect in the thermal
beam at an asymptotic distance L > LT . When incident
beam of atoms having momenta p splits in a set of scattered
beams having momenta p±n¯hk. The wave functions of the
states associated with momenta p+¯hk and p−¯hk, p+2¯hk
and p−2¯hk, . . . p+n¯hk and p−n¯hk acquire the same Tal-
bot phase and therefore no dephasing between these states
occurs, independently on the distance L and atomic veloc-
ity u. Interference of these states remains at the asymptotic
distance, leads to the 2nd, 4th . . . harmonics in the atomic
distribution which form the 2−order atomic grating on the
screen.

Instead, we examine the role of the longitudinal ve-
locity distribution when the width ¯u of the longitudinal
velocity distribution is of order of the average velocity,

¯u ∼ u

for distances

(D/d)LT ≫ y ≫ LT

(167)

(168)

in the Talbot eﬀect and separations L between the MS

(D/d)LT ≫ L ≫ LT

(168a)

in the Talbot-Lau eﬀect. We want to examine whether or
not it is possible under these conditions to obtain atomic
gratings having periods smaller than the MS producing
the scattering.

To understand how the gratings can survive the aver-
age over longitudinal velocities u, one should note that
it is the atomic density (30) and not the wave function
amplitude that is averaged. The phase factors in the
atomic density depending on the Talbot phase can be
unity for speciﬁc combinations of the spatial harmonics
in the atomic wave functions. The way in which this can
be achieved is illustrated in Fig. 13. When one com-
bines on the screen components of the scattered atomic
states associated with momenta ¯hk and −¯hk, 2¯hk and
−2¯hk, . . . , etc., the amplitudes of the combining states
acquire the same Talbot phases since the energy of the
scattered atoms does not depend on the direction of scat-
tering. The interference from these pairs of states leads
to a superposition of atomic gratings having period d/2,
d/4, etc.; the overall period of the grating is d/2. Grat-
ings originated from Talbot-Lau eﬀect can survive in a
similar manner.

A. Atomic density proﬁle for a thermal beam.

1. Talbot eﬀect

Consider ﬁrst the Talbot eﬀect, i. e., the atomic grat-
ing produced when an atomic beam having negligible an-
gular divergence, but a ﬁnite spread of longitudinal ve-
locities, is scattered by a MS having period d. For a given
u, the atomic density in the plane y = ut is given by [see
Eqs. (28, 30)]

fu(x, t) = Xn,n′

ηnη∗n′ exp(cid:2)i (n − n′) kx − i(cid:0)n2 − n′ 2(cid:1) φt(u)(cid:3) ,

(169)

where the Talbot phase φt(u) = ωkt = ωky/u, as given
by Eq. (29), is a function of u for ﬁxed y. Recall that
ηn is a Fourier component of the amplitude transmission
function η(x). Since the Talbot phase is much greater
than unity in the asymptotic region (168), the distribu-
tion (169) oscillates rapidly as a function of u. After av-
eraging over u, a non-zero result arises from only those
terms having

n′ = ±n.

(170)

There is a constant background term ¯f ( for a MS con-
sisting of an array of slits, ¯f is equal to the duty cycle f
of the MS) corresponding to contributions with n′ = n
and an interference term ˜f (x, t) corresponding to contri-
butions from n′ = −n. Neglecting all other terms, one
ﬁnds

f (x, t) = ¯f + ˜f (x, t),

2. Talbot-Lau eﬀect

To evaluate the Talbot-Lau density proﬁle in the
asymptotic limit (168), one must return to Eq.
(123)
and average it over longitudinal velocities. Using the
Fourier expansion of the amplitude transmission func-
tions in Eq. (123) and setting the smooth envelope func-
tion f (x) equal to unity, one ﬁnds

f (x, te) = Xq,n2

that only those terms in the sum having q = 0 or

q

contribute to the density. The q = 0 term is a back-
ground, given by ¯f1 ¯f2 [ ¯fj is deﬁned in terms of χj in the
same way that ¯f is deﬁned in terms of χ in Eq. (171a)],
while the terms satisfying Eq. (181) lead to the atomic
grating. Explicitly, one ﬁnds

is a Fourier component of the function F2(x) deﬁned
ν
in terms of η2 (x) in the same way that F is deﬁned in
terms of η in Eq. (175). The density is independent of te
for spatial separations L ≫ LT of the MS.
When m¯ℓ is even, all q are allowed according to Eq.
(181). When m¯ℓ is odd, only even values q contribute,
which means that the grating (182a) has a period equal
to dg/2. Equation (182a) has the same structure as Eq.
(85). Repeating the calculations leading to Eq. (93) one

In principle one can use Eqs. (182, 187, 190) to derive
a general analytical expression for the atomic density dis-
tribution, but, given the large number of cases, such an
expression is of limited use.
Instead, one can write a
computer code based on Eqs. (182, 187, 190) to obtain
the atomic density proﬁle. Using this code, we varied
the duty cycles of the MS to optimize the atomic grating

amplitude in the focal planes y = n+1
n L for n = 1− 4 and
equal periods of the MS, j = ℓ = 1. Calculations show
that one has to choose

f1 = f2 =

density proﬁle in a given focal plane. For example, at the

β are equal 1 and 1

for optimum widths there are no gratings caused by classi-
cal shadow eﬀect and conclude that using microfabricated
structures one observes gratings originated entirely from the

. These

at the focal plane y = 5
atomic density proﬁles are shown in Fig. 15. Since the
optimal duty cycles (191, 192) correspond to the limit
where the shadow eﬀect vanishes, the density proﬁles
(194) cannot be vestiges of the shadow eﬀect. They must
originate from matter-wave interference. One can com-
pare the density proﬁle (194a), valid for distances L be-
tween the MS larger than the Talbot distance, with that
of Fig. 10 for L ∼ LT (Talbot-Lau eﬀect).

VII. CONCLUSION

Atom interferometry is an emerging ﬁeld of atomic,
molecular and optical physics. In this review, we have
focused on the scattering of atoms by one or more mi-
crofabricated structures (MS). We have seen that the
scattering can be described in purely classical terms for
characteristic length scales L ≪ LT , where LT is the so-
called Talbot length. For L >
∼ LT , a classical description
of the atomic center-of-mass motion is no longer ade-
quate. Our approach has relied on an interpretation of
the phenomena in terms of the recoil an atom acquires
when it is scattered from a MS. With this approach, we
could make a connection with the theory of coherent
transients, for which a rich literature has already been
developed. We have considered both collimated beams
(Talbot eﬀect) and beams having large angular diver-
gence (shadow eﬀect, Talbot-Lau eﬀect) and have allowed
for a broad distribution of longitudinal velocities in the
atomic beam (Talbot and Talbot-Lau eﬀects in a thermal
beam). The next step would be to extend our consider-
ations to regimes corresponding to Bragg scattering and
Fraunhofer diﬀraction, allowing for an analysis of atom
interferometers which split atomic wave functions into
nonoverlapping paths.

Scattering of atoms by MS shares both similarities and
diﬀerences with scattering of atoms by standing-wave op-
tical ﬁelds (SW). Similarities include a periodical recov-
ery of the atomic interference pattern at multiples of the

29

Talbot distance (32) [or (127) for the Talbot-Lau eﬀect],
a compression of the atomic gratings with respect to the
periods of the MS or SW, spatial separation of the higher
order atomic gratings in diﬀerent focal planes, and split-
ting of the incident beam into an inﬁnite set of scattered
beams having momenta (p ± n¯hk). The diﬀerences are
due in large part to the nature of the scattering. The
MS produce a piecewise continuous atomic density proﬁle
while the SW produce a smooth atomic density proﬁle.
As a result, the decrease in period relative to that of the
classical shadow eﬀect observed in the Talbot-Lau eﬀect
using MS does not occur for scattering by standing-wave
ﬁelds. Moreover, the possibility of observing a Talbot-
Lau eﬀect caused entirely by matter-wave interference
(see Fig. 12) does not occur for the smooth amplitude
modulation by SW (Dubetsky and Berman, 1994).
In
the case of scattering by MS, the fact that the shadow
eﬀect does not give rise to atomic gratings in the focal
plane y = 2L for MS having duty cycles fi = 1
2 , is di-
rectly related to the stepwise amplitude modulation of
the atomic beam produced by the MS, as is evident from
Fig. 7.

For scattering by MS, the qualitative nature of the
atomic density proﬁle depends on the properties of the
incident atomic beam. When one observes the Talbot
eﬀect using a monovelocity beam, the atomic gratings
are discontinuous functions (see Fig. 3), but when one
averages these gratings over longitudinal velocities, the
atomic density is transformed into a piecewise continu-
ous proﬁle (compare with Fig. 14). Similarly, the shadow
eﬀect and Talbot-Lau eﬀect atomic gratings (which are
averaged over transverse velocities) are piecewise contin-
uous, but they are transformed into proﬁles which are
discontinuous only in the second derivative when aver-
aged over longitudinal velocities (compare Figs. 10 and
15). These examples show that averaging over transverse
or longitudinal velocities tends to smooth out the atomic
density proﬁles.

It is clear that many of the situations analyzed in this
chapter have direct applications to atom lithography. We
can expect that future developments in this emerging
ﬁeld will incorporate many of the basic ideas which have
been encountered in our discussion.

APPENDIX:

A method for calculating the integral

h[β]I

(w) =Z 1

0

dzθ [{β}F − {αz − w}F ] ,

(A1)

with 0 ≤ w ≤ 1 is presented here. The function θ is the
Heaviside step function and [a]I and {a}F refer to the
integral and fractional parts of a. Depending on the val-
ues of the parameters α, β and w the integrand in this
equation can jump from 0 to 1 several times inside the
range z ∈ [0, 1] . The value of the integral is the total
length of the intervals in this range where

ζ (z) ≡ {αz − w}F ≤ {β}F .

(A2)

To determine this length one needs to ﬁnd the values of
z for which the function {αz − w}F equals 0 and where
it equals {β}F .This function is shown in Fig. 16.

FIG. 16. Function {αz − w} undergoes jumps at the
points ar = (r − 1 + w) /α and is equal to {β} at the points
br = (r − 1 + w + {β}) /α. For [α] > 1 and 1 ≤ r ≤ [α],

is ([α] − 1) (br − ar); when w > 1−{β} one gets term b0 from

for b[α] < 1 or b[α] > 1; in the same manner one calculates

ar < 1, i. e. contribution to Eq. (99) from interim (cid:2)a1, a[α](cid:3)
[0, a1]; term from z ∈(cid:2)a[α], b[α](cid:3) is equal to {β} /α or 1 − a[α]
term from interim (cid:2)a[α]+1, b[α]+1(cid:3) in diﬀerent possible cases.
When αz − w = r − 1, where r is an integer, ζ (z) = 0,

i. e. zeros of ζ (z) are given by

z = ar = (r − 1 + w) /α.
For z > ar the function ζ (z) evolves as

(A3)

30

ζ (z) = α (z − ar)

(A4)

and equals {β}F at the point

z = br = ar + {β}F
α

= (r − 1 + w + {β}F )/α.

(A5)

Since contributions to the integral (A1) vanish unless
ar ≤ 1 and br ≥ 0 and since 0 ≤ w ≤ 1, it follows
from Eqs. (A3, A5) that 0 ≤ r ≤ (1 + [α]I ). For the time
being, we assume that α > 1.
intervals [ar, br] totally or partially within the
range [0, 1] contribute to the integral (A1). Let us de-
note the contribution from the range [ar, br] by Ar and
the total value of the integral by

All

h[β]I

(w) =

1+[α]I

Xr=0

Ar.

(A6)

When ar > 0 and br < 1 the interval [ar, br] lies entirely
to the range [0, 1] and

Ar = br − ar = {β}F

α

;

ar > 0 and br < 1

(A7)

When 1 > ar > 0 and br ≥ 1, the maximum value of z
contributing to the integral (A1) is z = 1 and

Ar = 1 − ar;

1 > ar > 0 and br ≥ 1

(A8)

Similarly, for ar < 0 and 0 < br < 1,

Ar = br;

ar < 0 and 0 < br < 1

(A8a)

and for br ≤ 0,

Ar = 0;

br ≤ 0

(A8b)

For given r, α, and β, the values of ar and br can depend
on w, giving rise to a dependence of h[β]I
on w. Note
that (br − ar) ≤ 1, which follows from Eqs. (A5) and the
assumption that α > 1.
We ﬁrst consider the range 1 ≤ r ≤ [α]I − 1, for which
br < 1 and ar > 0 for any w ∈ [0, 1]. It then follows from
Eq. (A7) that the total contribution A′ to the integral
(A1) from the region (cid:2)a1, b[α]I−1(cid:3) is given by
Ar = {β}F ([α]I − 1)/α.

.

(A10)

We now turn our attention to A[α]I and A[α]I +1.

It
follows from Eq. (A3) that a[α]I ∈ [0, 1]. Only the points
b[α]I
, a[α]I +1, b[α]I +1 can lie to the right of the range
[0, 1], which occurs when

w ≥ ({α}F + 1 − {β}F ) ≡ w1,
w ≥ {α}F ≡ w2,
w ≥ ({α}F − {β}F ) ≡ w3,

(A11)

respectively. From Eqs. (A8, A8a, A8b), one ﬁnds that
A[α]I , and A[α]I +1 are given by

α

w > w1

1 − a[α]I = {α}F −w+1

A[α] =(cid:26) b[α]I − a[α]I = {β}F /α w < w1

,

(A12)

w > w2

w3 < w < w2

w < w3

(A12a)

In order to sum A0, A[α]I , and A[α]I +1 it is convenient
to separate regions of α and β according to the relative
values of w1, w2, w3 and ¯w. Since

w3 ≤ w2 ≤ w1,

w3 ≤ ¯w ≤ w1,

(A13)

(A13a)

and w2 = {α}F ≥ 0 one can distinguish four cases
w3 ≤ 0 ≤ ¯w ≤ w2;

[{β}F ≥ max ({α}F , 1 − {α}F )] ,
(A14)

w3 ≤ 0 ≤ w2 ≤ ¯w;

[{α}F ≤ {β}F ≤ 1 − {α}F ] ,

(A14a)

0 ≤ w3 ≤ ¯w ≤ w2;

[1 − {α}F ≤ {β}F ≤ {α}F ] ,

(A14b)

This contribution is independent of w and represents a
constant background term.

Since r ≤ [α]I + 1, the only remaining contributions
to the integral can come from A0, A[α]I
and A[α]I +1.
These terms depend on w and represent the atomic
gratings. Let us ﬁrst consider A0.
If r = 0, b0 =
(−1 + w + {β}F )/α < 1 and a0 = (−1 + w)/α < 0.
It then follows from Eqs. (A8, A8a, A8b) that

0 ≤ w3 ≤ w2 ≤ ¯w ;

[{β}F ≤ min ({α}F , 1 − {α}F )] .
(A14c)

Consider, for example, the case (A14) for the range of w
given by

0 ≤ w ≤ ¯w.

(A15)

31

For integer β this corresponds to the entire range of al-
(A10, A12, A12a)
lowed w, 0 ≤ w ≤ 1. From Eqs.
= {β}F /α, and A[α]I +1 =
one ﬁnds A0 = 0, A[α]I
({α}F − w) /α. As a result, one ﬁnds that A (w) =
A0 + A[α]I

+ A[α]I +1 is given by

A(w) = ({β}F + {α}F − w) /α.
By combining Eqs. (A9, A16), one obtains

(A16)

h[β]I

(w) = ({β}F [α]I + {α}F − w) /α.

(A17)

Even though Eq. (A17) have been derived for α ≥ 1, one
can verify that it holds for arbitrary α.
Other values of w and other cases (A14a-A14c) can be
considered in the same manner. As a result, one arrives
at Eqs. (100, 101) of the text.

[1] The scattering of atoms by standing-wave ﬁelds, rather
than MS, is a bit more subtle. For resonant standing wave
ﬁelds, which can act as amplitude gratings, the situation
is unchanged. On the other hand, oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds act
as phase gratings for the atoms; as such, they produce no
eﬀect on classically moving particles. Strictly speaking,
therefore, one must quantize the center-of-mass motion to
calculate the scattering of the atoms by the ﬁelds. Never-
theless, in a manner analogous to the normal photon echo,
it is possible to assign phases to the atoms while they are
freely evolving between the MS and the screen and still
consider the motion as classical in these regions.

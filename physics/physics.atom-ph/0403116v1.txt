Precise energies of rovibrational states of the exotic hydrogen-like molecule (dtµ)X ee
are of importance for dtµ resonant formation, which is a key process in the muon-catalyzed
fusion cycle. The effect of an internal structure and motion of dtµ quasi-nucleus on energy
levels is studied using the three-body description of the (dtµ)X ee molecule based on the
hierarchy of scales and corresponding energies of constituent subsystems. For a number of
rovibrational states of (dtµ)dee and (dtµ)tee, the shifts and splittings of energy levels are
calculated in the second order of perturbation theory.

I.

INTRODUCTION

It is known that one stopped muon in a deuterium-tritium mixture yields more than 100 nuclear
fusion reactions. The process of muon-catalyzed fusion has been intensively studied and a detailed
description exists in the literature, e. g., in review articles [1, 2, 3, 4]. One of the key processes in
the muon-catalyzed fusion cycle is the formation of the hydrogen-like exotic molecule (dtµ)X ee
(for a sake of generality X stands for either isotope d, t, or p), in which a dtµ meso-molecular ion
substitutes one of the nuclei in the hydrogen molecule. It is widely accepted that the resonance
mechanism, proposed by Vesman [5], is responsible for the high rate of the dtµ formation. Due to
this mechanism, dtµ in a loosely bound excited state to be produced by low-energy collisions of
tµ mesoatoms and DX molecules in a resonance process

followed by dtµ transition for the bound state. The rate of a resonance process is sensitive to
the precise resonance position and an accuracy better then 1 meV is necessary in order to obtain
reasonable theoretical estimates of the formation rate [1, 2, 3, 4].

Resonance formation can take place provided the energy releasing in dtµ binding is transferred
to the rovibrational excitation of the exotic molecule (dtµ)X ee. This is actually the case as dtµ
has a loosely bound excited state with angular momentum l = 1 and binding energy which is
comparable to vibrational quantum of the (dtµ)X ee molecule. In a non-relativistic approximation,
different calculations determine with a good accuracy the binding energy of the isolated dtµ mesic
molecule [1, 2, 3, 4]. To obtain the precise value of the binding energy one has to correct the non-
relativistic energy for relativistic effects, hyperﬁne effects, ﬁnite nuclear size, vacuum polarization,
and others. The resonance position is determined, besides the binding energy of isolated dtµ,
by the energy of the rovibrational excitation of the hydrogen-like molecule (dtµ)X ee with one
nucleus the particle X and the other the excited dtµ mesic molecule. To a good approximation,

2

the rovibrational spectrum of (dtµ)X ee can be calculated by treating dtµ as a point-like charged
particle [6, 7]. In this respect, one should note that the ”size” of the exited dtµ mesic molecule
with l = 1 is of order 0.05 a.u. [8] that is much smaller than inter-nuclears distanse in the whole
molecule. Nevertheless, to reach the required accuracy of the order of tenth meV one should take
into account the energy shift which arises from the internal structure and motion of dtµ.

The effect of a dtµ ﬁnite size has been previously investigated in a simple aproach [8, 9, 10]
where the energy shifts for the (dtµ)dee has been obtaned by multiplying on 1.45 the shift calcu-
lated for the atom-like system (dtµ)e in the second order perturbation theory. This simple approach
is not able to take account of the molecule structure, in particular, the calculated energy shift does
not depend on the rovibrational quantum numbers. In contrast with these calculations, the molec-
ular structure, i. e., the dependence on angular momentum, was explicitly taken into account in
the elaborate six-body calculation of the (dtµ)dee energy shifts in the ﬁrst order perturbation the-
ory [8]. However, the ﬁrst order is not sufﬁcient because the second order of the perturbation
theory gives the same contribution in energy shifts. Recently, resonance positions in the low-
energy tµ + D2 scattering have been obtaned in the elaborate three-body calculation [11, 12]. Only
few resonance states with zero total angular has been considered in this paper.

The main aim of the present paper is to calculate the energy shifts (dtµ)X ee which arise from
the internal structure and motion of dtµ. In this calculation, the description of (dtµ)X ee is reduced
to solution of three-body problem for heavy particles tµ, d and X . This approach reliably takes into
account the structure of the (dtµ)X ee molecule, i. e., on the hierarchy of scales and corresponding
energies of constituent subsystems. As a result, the energy shifts are obtained for a number of
vibrational and rotational states of the (dtµ)dee and (dtµ)tee in the second order of perturbation
theory.

II. METHOD

A structure of the exotic molecule (dtµ)X ee is characterized by hierarchy of scales and corre-
sponding energies of constituent subsystems. In this respect, a tµ mesic atom is small in compari-
son with its mean separation from a deuteron in the loosely bound dtµ mesic molecule, that allows
to treat tµ as a point-like neutral particle which interacts with a deuteron by the short-range effec-
tive potential. There is also interaction of tµ with the second nucleus X , however, this might be
neglected due to large separation between these particles. In turn, a size of a dtµ mesic molecule
is small in comparison with the amplitude of vibrations in (dtµ)X ee, therefore, it moves as a
point-like quasinucleus near the equilibrium position. For this reason the effect of dtµ structure is
considered in the framework of perturbation theory (PT).

Furthermore, two electrons in the hydrogen-like molecule (dtµ)X ee move much faster than
heavy particles d, X , and tµ that allows to use the familiar Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation,
i. e., to solve for electronic problem with the ﬁxed charged particles d and X thus obtaining the BO
energy which plays a role of the effective potential between d and X . The electronic excitations,
which requires a considerable amount of energy [13], are not taken into account for the low-energy
processes under consideration.

As a result, the description of (dtµ)X ee is reduced to solution of three-body problem for three
particles tµ, d and X . The interaction between charged d and X is described by the well-known BO
potential for the hydrogen molecule. In accord with the treatment of a tµ mesic atom as a point-
like neutral particle, the present calculation does not explicitly use the tµ + d effective potential,
rather, the result is expressed via the low-energy tµ + d scattering phase shifts and characteristics
of the tµ mesic molecule in the loosely bound excited state.

3

The (dtµ)X ee states are either true bound states or narrow resonances if their energy is below
or above the tµ + DX threshold. As the energy shifts are mainly determined by the coupling with
closed channels, in the present calculation both resonances and bound states are treated on an equal
footing thus neglecting a small contribution to the energy shifts which comes from the coupling
with the open tµ + DX channel.

A natural zeroth-order approximation for the calculation of the (dtµ)X ee energy levels is to
treat a dtµ mesic molecule as a point quasi-nucleus with the mass of dtµ and the unit charge. The
calculations of the energy levels in this approximation are presented in [6, 7] for different isotopes
X of the hydrogen-like molecule (dtµ)X ee. Clearly, the treatment of dtµ as a point-like particle is
) in the Schr¨odinger equation (1) by
equivalent to the replacement of the exact potential V (
the potential V (r ) which describes the BO interaction between X and a point particle located in a
dtµ center-of-mass. Thus, the effect of dtµ structure, which leads to the shift of the zeroth-order
energy levels, originates from the perturbation potential

In correspondence with the Vesman mechanism, (dtµ)X ee contains a dtµ mesic molecule in
the weakly-bound state with binding energy e 11 (v = 1, l = 1). Other dtµ states, which binding
energies signiﬁcantly exceed all the characteristic energies of the problem under consideration,
will not be taken into account in the calculation of the energy shifts.

B. Perturbation theory

i

h

a

−

The effect of dtµ structure is small due to smallness of a dtµ mesic molecule in comparison
with a characteristic length of a dtµ motion in the molecular potential V (r ). In other words, the
perturbation Vp is small in comparison with V (r ) and can be expanded in powers of the small pa-
rameter a r. Correspondingly, the dimensionless parameter of perturbation theory (PT) is the ratio
of the average distance between a deuteron and dtµ center-of-mass a
to the average amplitude
of vibrations

in the molecular potential near the equilibrium inter-nuclei distance a.

One should note that the lowest order term of expansion Vp, which is proportional to a r, does
not contribute to the energy shifts in the ﬁrst order PT, therefore, the energy shift of order (a r)2
must be obtained up to the second order PT. Besides, Vp couples the rotational states with l =
1 while the state with l = L remains uncoupled. As the separation of the rotational levels
L
is comparatively small, the levels’ coupling cannot be a priori neglected and requires explicit
treatment. Thus, the energy shifts will be determined in the second order degenerate PT by solving
a secular equation

Using the following reliable approximations, one obtains simple, though providing an accu-
racy required for the present calculation, expressions for the multipole matrix elements (16, 17,
18). Firstly, the matrix elements are completely determined by the BO potential for the hydrogen
molecule V (r ) which is fairly well known from the calculations [6, 7, 14, 15]. As far as (dtµ)X ee
is produced in low-energy tµ + DX collisions, only the lowest vibrational states should be taken

The approximation (20) accurately reproduces the exact energies of the lowest vibrational states
calculated in [6, 7].

Secondly, the rotational energy l(l + 1)/r 2 in (3) for the hydrogen-like molecule equals about
4a. u. that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the vibrational energy
2 a. u. Therefore, under usual approximation, the centrifugal term is treated perturbatively,

and the wave functions F

the rotational spectrum calculated in [6, 7] is in a good agreement with the above expression (21)
4 a. u. Thus, under the above approximations, the radial wave function

Calculation of the quasi-nucleus matrix elements (14, 15) is based on the smallness of a tµ
size in comparison with a size of the loosely bound (n = 1, l = 1) dtµ state. Thus, almost in

where k = √2µ1e 11 and the asymptotic normalization constant Ca was determined by a compar-
ison with the exact three-body calculations [9, 16, 17]. For the same reasons, the asymptotic

The energy shifts and level splittings will be calculated by solving the eigenvalue equation (6)

The vibrational quantum w

and the rotational-energy constant vr are determined by the BO
(cid:16)
inter-nuclei potential of the hydrogen molecule near its minimum or, equivalently, by the low-lying
part of the (dtµ)X ee vibrational-rotational spectra calculated in [6, 7]. Fitting the BO potential
near the equilibrium distance a = 1.401 a.u. to the harmonic, unharmonic, and Morse potentials
provides consistent determination of both w
and the unharmonicity parameter a M. As the BO
potential is independent of an isotopic composition µ2w 2 and a M are independent of the masses of
heavy particles due to Eq. (20). The result of ﬁt gives w = 321.8meV for (dtµ)dee (corespondingly,
w = 273.1meV for (dtµ)tee) with a few per cent accuracy and the unharmonicity parameter a M =
0.7a. u. For these parameters, the energies of the lowest vibrational states in the approximate
potential are in reasonable agreement with results of [6, 7].

The rotational spectra calculated in [6, 7] are ﬁtted to Eq. (21) for 1

For the lowest vibrational state n = 1, one obtains vr = 2.43meV for (dtµ)dee and vr = 1.85meV
1/a2 that determines the isotopic
for (dtµ)tee. These values agree with a simple estimate 2µ2vr
dependence of vr. Although vr slightly decreases for the higher vibrational states, the above values
will be used for n > 1, which leads to a few per cent error.

10 and each 1

Determination of the binding energy e 11 of a dtµ loosely bound state was a subject of numerous
elaborated calculations. As a result, the value e 11 = 596meV [1, 2, 4] is obtained for the lowest
hyperﬁne state by taking into account relativisting effects, hyperﬁne effects, ﬁnite nuclear size, and
vacuum polarization. The asymptotic constant Ca has been determined in a number of papers [9,
16, 17] by a comparison of the asymptotic expression (24) with the three-body wave function. In
the following, one accepts the value Ca = 0.874/√2 obtained in the last elaborated calculation [17]
of the wave function in a wide asymptotic region of large distances between d and tµ. Using Ca,
e 11, and w one can calculate the energy scale v0 (31). As w 2
the parameter
v0 (31) is independent of m3, i. e., it is the same for any isotope X . Given the above numerical
values one obtains v0 = 1.81meV.

For a sake of completeness, it is interesting to estimate the energy scale also for the molecule
(ddµ)X ee using the values e 11 = 1975meV, Ca = 1.006/√2, and w = 257meV that gives v0 =
0.4meV. Although the present approach requires some modiﬁcations to describe (ddµ)X ee, viz.,
taking into account identity of nuclei in ddµ and essential role of unharmonic corrections to the
5 times
BO potential, one can qualitatively conclude that the energy shifts in (ddµ)X ee are 4
less than in (dtµ)X ee.

−

In the framework of the present approach, the energy shifts in the ﬁrst order PT are given by
a simple dependence on angular momentum l (32 - 33) containing a single parameter v0. It is
worthwhile to compare this result with the ﬁrst ever elaborate six-body calculation of the (dtµ)dee
energy shifts in the ﬁrst order PT [8]. In this paper, the molecular structure, i. e., the dependence
on l, was explicitly taken into account that is in contrast with previous calculations [9, 10, 18]
where the l-independent energy shift was obtained by scaling the result for the atom-like four-
body system (dtµ)e. The monopole contribution calculated in Ref. [8], as pointed out in this
paper, depends on the choice of the coordinate system that does not allow a comparison. For this
reason, only the quadrupole contribution to the ﬁrst order PT energy shifts of Ref. [8] will be
compared with the present results. The quadrupole contribution of Ref. [8] is given in Table II of
that paper, while in the present approach D E(1)
2(l1l1), as follows from Eqs. (11),
(22), and (27). The both results are in excellent agreement with each other, as shown in Table I.

expressed in the form D E(1)

practically independent of l and L and agrees with v0 = 1.81meV. An agreement between a present

good argument approving the validity of the present approach.

point-like dtµ quasi-nucleus.

that applicability of the harmonic approximation for the BO potential has been checked by using
in calculation the modiﬁed dipole matrix element (23) that gives an estimate of the unharmonic
correction of order 5% in the energy shifts. Calculations reveal that the energy shifts are essentially
depend on isotopic composition and the molecular quantum numbers n and l that is basically
connected with the cancellation of the ﬁrst and second order PT contributions. In particular, the
energy shifts decrease with increasing n so that D
become very small or even negative for n = 4.
±
The reason for this dependence is increasing of the dipole matrix element (22) with increasing n
that, in turn, leads to increasing of the second order PT contribution. Till now, the cancellation
effect was widely discussed, e. g., in [9, 10, 18], nevertheless, the dependence on a molecular
quantum state was beyond the scope of these papers where only the atom-like system (dtµ)e has
been calculated. On the other hand, the calculation [8] determined the l-dependence only in the
ﬁrst order PT.

The dependence of the energy shifts on quantum numbers is illustrated in Figure 1 for the
4. Besides decreasing of energy shifts for higher n, notice
(dtµ)dee states with n = 2, 3 and l = 0
inverse ordering of levels, i. e., the highest level with L = l
1 for n = 2 becomes the lowest for
n = 3. Except for D + which values at small l = 1, 2 are quite different, the results reveal a weak
dependence on l with splitting of levels of order 0.2meV.

As discussed in the end of Section III B the dependence of energy shifts and levels splitting
on quantum numbers to a good accuracy are expressed by simple formulas (39, 41) via few pa-
rameters. Numerical values of 16w

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The hydrogen-like molecule (dtµ)X ee is treated in the framework of the three-body model for
heavy particles d, tµ, and X . The model is based on the fact that a tµ mesic atom is small in com-
parison with its mean separation from a deuteron and that a size of a dtµ mesic molecule is small
in comparison with the amplitude of vibrations in (dtµ)X ee. In this approach, the interaction of
charged particles d and X is described by the well-known BO potential of the hydrogen molecule,
while the description of a dtµ mesic molecule is given in terms of binding energy e 11, the asymp-
totic constant Ca, and the low-energy s- and d-wave scattering phase shifts d
l (k) regardless of the
explicit form of the d + tµ effective potential.

In the framework of the present approach, shift and splitting of the (dtµ)X ee energy levels
which result from an internal structure and motion of a dtµ quasi-nucleus are calculated in the
second order PT. This allows to ﬁnd the energy levels, i. e., the positions of the tµ + DX scattering
resonances with an accuracy about tenth meV, which is key importance for determination of the
dtµ formation rate. Calculation are performed for different vibrational (n = 2, 3) and rotational
(0
4) states for the molecules of the different isotope composition X = d,t. In this respect,
note that different vibrational states of (dtµ)X ee can be presently observed in the atomic beam
experiments [25]. One should emphasize that the effect of dtµ structure breaks the degeneracy

of unperturbative states with the same l and different L that produces a triple-resonance structure
in place of every unperturbed level except for l = 0. As the splitting value is of order of the shift
itself, the effect of splitting should be taken into account in the energy dependence of the resonance
formation rate.

In addition, one should mention some aspects of the present calculations. Firstly, the ﬁrst
order PT quadrupole contribution to the energy shifts is in agreement with the elaborate six-body
calculation [8] that is a good argument approving the validity of the present approach. Secondly,
the energy shift and splitting on rotational-vibrational quantum numbers n and l is conveniently
expressed by a simple analytical dependence (39,41). The next, it is shown that coupling of the
1 and l = L + 1 that arises due to the internal dtµ (l = 1) structure
rotational states with l = L
contributes less than 0.03meV to the energy shifts.

−

It is of interest to compare the presents result with direct non-perturbative three-body calcu-
lation of tµ + D2 scattering [11, 12] in which the effect of dtµ structure is explicitly taken into
account. The positions of narrow resonances calculated in this paper corespond to energy levels of
(dtµ)dee for L = 0 (l = 1) and n = 3, 4. For two approximations of the effective potential between
tµ and d used in [11, 12], energy shifts are, respectively, 1meV and 4meV for n = 3 and 2meV
and 5meV for n = 4. The reason for noticeable difference (about 3meV) is not clear since both
potentials allow a good description of the low-energy properties of the tµ + d system. The depen-
dence on the choice of the effective potential and a limitation only by L = 0 hinders a quantitative
comparison of the present results and those of [11, 12]. Qualitatively, the energy shifts obtained
in Ref. [11, 12] exceed the present ones and, contrary to PT considerations, the value for n = 4 is
higher than for n = 3. This n-dependence clearly deserves further investigation.

The present approach, which reliably takes into account the structure of the exotic molecule,
is promising for wider applications, in particular, for determination of resonance positions and
formation rates beyond PT by solving the scattering problem. In this respect, one should note that,
besides Refs. [11, 12], the formation rate was calculated only in the ﬁrst order PT. Even in the ﬁrst
order PT, as shown in [26], the dipole approximation for perturbation is questionable. Finally, it
is interesting to apply the present approach to the problem of formation of metastable dtµ mesic
molecules [27, 28].

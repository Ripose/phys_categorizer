Abstract. We report on the loading of atoms contained in a magneto-optic trap into
multiple optical traps formed within the focused beam of a CO2 laser. We show that
under certain circumstances it is possible to create a linear array of dipole traps with
well separated maxima. This is achieved by focusing the laser beam through lenses
uncorrected for spherical aberration. We demonstrate that the separation between the
micro-traps can be varied, a property which may be useful in experiments which require
the creation of entanglement between atoms in diﬀerent micro-traps. We suggest other
experiments where an array of these traps could be useful.

Multiple micro-optical atom traps with a spherically aberrated laser beam

1. Introduction

The trapping of atoms at the intensity maximum of an optical ﬁeld that is far-detuned
to the red of an atomic transition has been the subject of study for almost a decade
now [1, 2]. There has been a rapid growth of interest in these far-oﬀ resonant optical
traps (FORTs) because of their versatility and wide range of possible applications.
For example, they have been used to create an all optical Bose-Einstein condensate
[3, 4, 5], a degenerate Fermi gas [6] and an all optical atomic laser [7]. These traps
in the form of optical lattices have been employed in theoretical models to open new
frontiers in quantum information research. The proposal of Brennen et al.
[8] for
quantum logic gates using neutral atoms in optical lattices, provided a way around the
decoherence problem which aﬀects schemes involving charged particles. They showed
that entanglement between a collection of trapped neutral atoms can be created with a
laser using the induced electric dipole-dipole interaction. The main diﬃculty associated
with their scheme has been the need to construct a lattice FORT with suﬃcient
separation between unit cells to address them individually and with a suﬃcient volume
to load many atoms at each trapping site. These challenges have been the focus of
another series of experimental eﬀorts. For example, using a holographic phase plate,
Boiron et al. [9] constructed an optical lattice with a period of 29µm using a YAG laser.
In other experiments, the Hannover group have developed a technique using arrays
of microlenses to focus a red detuned laser beam and create a series of micro-traps
for use as quantum memories [10, 11, 12]. Peil et al.
[13] employed two independent
optical lattices, whose spatial periods diﬀer by a factor of three, to load a Bose-Einstein
condensate of Rb 87 atoms in sites having a separation approximately 30µm.

In most FORT experiments atoms are trapped at the intensity maxima formed by
a focused laser beam in either a travelling or standing wave conﬁguration. In this paper,
we demonstrate a new approach in which the peaks in the diﬀraction pattern associated
with spherical aberration in the vicinity of the focal plane of a lens are used to create a
linear array of micro-traps. The primary spherical aberration pattern close to the focal
plane has been studied and well documented by several authors. For example, Evans
and Morgan [14, 15] theoretically produced the aberration pattern of a lens that was
not corrected for spherical aberration in order to explain laser induced breakdown in
gases, while Smith [16] experimentally veriﬁed the primary spherical aberration intensity
distribution produced by a lens uncorrected for spherical aberration. The spherical
aberration in our experiments is induced by the lenses in the path of a CO2 laser beam.
It will be seen that most of the contribution to the spherical aberration comes from the
ﬁnal lens (primary lens) which is employed to focus the CO2 laser beam onto a cold
atomic cloud. We will show that varying the incident beam size on the primary lens
enables us to change the aberration pattern and hence control the separation of the
micro-traps over a range of about a millimeter. One of the advantages of our set up
is the use of a CO2 laser as a far oﬀ-resonant light source. This considerably improves
the coherence time compared to some of the atom optical experiments mentioned above

which use YAG lasers to create dipole traps with micron size separation. Furthermore,
the ability to vary the spacing between the micro-traps over a range of about a millimeter
makes the addressing of the individual traps feasible using the techniques developed by
N¨agerl et al. [17].

This paper is constructed as follows.

In section 2 we discuss the theory of the
multiple trap potential that is used in simulations. Section 3 is devoted to the description
of the experimental setup. In section 4 we present the experimental data and compare
them with our simulation results. Our suggestions and future plans for the use of these
potentials appear in the conclusion section.

2. Aberration eﬀect of a lens on the incident laser light near the focus

Since the potential well depth of any FORT is proportional to the intensity, we now
proceed to calculate the intensity distribution produced near the focus of the lens used
in our experiment. Following Born and Wolf [18] and Yoshida and Asakura [19], the
intensity close to the focus of a lens for an incident Gaussian beam is given by,

optical system. Our set up has three lenses in the path of the laser light (see Fig. 1).

vacuum chamber) we refer to as the primary lens.

surfaces. C is known as the conjugate variable and is deﬁned as C = (u1 + u2)/(u1
where u1 and u2 are the divergence angles of the gaussian beam before and after passing
through the lens. These angles are given by ui = λ/πw0i; i = 1, 2, where w01 and w02
are the minimum beam waists of the beam before and after the lens. It should be noted
that according to the usual sign convention, if the lens produces a converging beam,

then u2 is negative so that the denominator in the deﬁnition of C is not zero in our
experiment.

In the experimental situation we wish to model, the separation of the telescope
lenses is varied by moving the second lens in the optical system and keeping the other
lenses ﬁxed. Thus the ﬁrst lens of the telescope contributes a constant amount to the
total spherical aberration coeﬃcient β as its w and C parameters are ﬁxed. As the
position of the second lens in the telescope is moved, the beam size on this lens and
on the third (the primary) lens will change resulting in changes to the parameters w
and C for these lenses. This leads to a variable contribution to β by these last two
lenses and therefore a variable aberration pattern near the focus of the primary lens.
We have found that for our experiment the primary spherical aberration of the primary
lens varies from around 0.1 up to around 18.2 wavelengths.

3. Experimental set up

×

In the following, we present an experimental setup which enables us to create the
spherical aberration pattern to form a series of micro optical traps. Our experimental
apparatus consists of a stainless steel, octagonal vacuum chamber which is maintained
10−10 torr by an ion pump. A 3.1 cm diameter ZnSe
at a pressure of approximately 5
viewport allows us to focus the 10.6 µm light from a CO2 laser into the center of this
chamber. The focusing lens (the primary lens) is a meniscus lens with a 3.81 cm focal
length and 2.54 cm diameter placed inside the vacuum chamber and is not corrected
for spherical aberration
. This lens is mounted such that the convex side is towards the
†
center of the chamber to maximize the spherical aberration eﬀects. Before reaching the
primary lens, the CO2 laser beam passes through a telescope composed of two plano
convex lenses with 6.35 cm and 12.7 cm focal lengths placed approximately 2 meters
away from the chamber. This conﬁguration allows us to control the beam size at the
lens inside the chamber by varying the separation of the telescope lenses. Consequently,
we are able to change the spherical aberration pattern close to the gaussian focus inside
the chamber.

The trapping light was directed into the vacuum system in a geometry such that it
propagated at an angle of 45 degrees to the vertical. The light for this beam originated
from a 50 Watt, RF excited CO2 laser. The total laser power was controlled by passing
the output light through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The ﬁrst order of the
modulator was then directed into the telescope to expand the beam. The optical
arrangement used in this experiment is as shown in Fig. 1. For our atomic source
we used a magneto-optic trap (MOT), formed with a 20 G/cm magnetic ﬁeld gradient,
and by two 5 cm diameter, 20 mW beams. Each beam made three passes through the
F ′ = 3 transition of the D2
chamber and was detuned 15 MHz below the F = 2

this arrangement. One of the most diﬃcult aspects involved in the setup of a FORT is
the beam alignment. Since the FORT light is so far from resonance, no ﬂuorescence is
induced and it is hard to determine whether the FORT beam is overlapping with the
MOT or not. To overcome this diﬃculty we have devised a method which allows us
to observe the position of the CO2 laser beam in real time directly on an inexpensive
CCD camera that normally monitors the MOT. To accomplish this it is necessary to
improve the contrast between the atoms trapped in the MOT and those trapped in the
FORT. Several techniques will work, for example, increasing the detuning of the MOT
light from resonance, or reducing the intensity of the MOT light. A similar eﬀect is
obtained if these operations are performed on the repumping light. With any one of
these methods, the brightness of the MOT and the eﬀect of its near resonant light on
pushing atoms out of the FORT, can be lessened. However, there can still be enough
near-resonant light present in the MOT beams to cause atoms that are contained in
the FORT to ﬂuoresce and hence make the FORT beam visible. Using these techniques
greatly simpliﬁes alignment of our CO2 laser beam, turning a task which could previously
take several days into one that can be performed in minutes.

To load the FORT with atoms we apply the following procedure. First the MOT
is loaded for 30 seconds from the background vapor while at the same time the CO2
laser remains switched on. Then, as a key step in eﬃciently loading the FORT, we
reduce the repump intensity by a factor of 50 compared to its initial value to make a
temporal dark SPOT [21, 22]. This strong reduction in the repump power occurs 50 to
70 ms before switching oﬀ the MOT trapping beams. Alongside reducing the repump
power, we jump the trapping beam detuning to
80 MHz for further laser cooling and
to counteract the detuning change induced by the light shift of the CO2 beam. If we did
not jump the detuning, atoms in the region of the FORT would see the MOT beams
positively detuned, thus reducing the eﬀectiveness of the MOT. Finally, after the main
MOT beams have been extinguished, we adiabatically switch oﬀ the MOT magnetic
ﬁeld. The earliest time that we can image the FORT is 100 ms after releasing the MOT.
This ensures that any of the untrapped atoms have suﬃcient time to fall away from the
FORT under the inﬂuence of gravity. Both the MOT and the FORT are destructively
imaged by observing the absorption of a resonant probe laser which passes through the
atom cloud and is incident on a CCD camera. By integrating the optical density across
the atom cloud we are able to determine the number of trapped atoms. When imaging
the FORT, the CO2 laser beams are switched oﬀ 3.5 ms before the image is taken to
allow the cloud of atoms to expand to a size which is signiﬁcantly above the resolution
of the optical system.

4. Results and Discussion

Using the procedure described in Section 3 we have been able to load several micro-
optical traps created by the aberration pattern of the meniscus lens. Interestingly, our
observations show that there are approximately 10 sites capable of holding the atoms
when the beam diameter is similar to the size of the primary lens, in very good agreement
with our simulation results. For a given amount of spherical aberration β, the separation
between the micro-traps decreases as one moves away from the focus and towards the
primary lens. Therefore the number of micro-traps being loaded from a MOT at a given
time depends where the MOT and FORT overlap each other. Usually 3 micro-traps
are loaded by placing the atomic cloud of the the MOT close to the gaussian focus
of the lens. This can be increased to 4 or 5 micro-traps by moving the MOT a few
millimeters towards the lens (to move the MOT we change the currents in the nulling
coils designed to cancel out stray magnetic ﬁelds). Fig. 2 shows three absorption images
of the FORT and their corresponding simulated potentials at two extreme separations
of the telescope lenses and one intermediate separation. The lower panel of Fig. 2 shows
that the central FORT and one micro-trap are loaded. This happens when there is
higher spherical aberration β. Our simulations show that the separation between the
peaks is greater when there is a high spherical aberration. So in the lower panel of Fig. 2,
the spacial extent of the MOT is such that it could load only one micro-trap along with
the central FORT. For the parameters of Fig. 2(c), we found from equation 2 that the

Multiple micro-optical atom traps with a spherically aberrated laser beam

×

spherical aberration β is around 18.2 wavelengths. The central panel of Fig. 2 shows the
central FORT and two micro-traps that are loaded when β is around 12.6 wavelengths.
In the upper picture, the spherical aberration is diminished by the small beam size on
the primary lens so that only the highly populated central FORT remains. This higher
population is due to the fact that for such cases the beam is not focused tightly so that
the capture volume of the FORT is increased. In the absence of the spherical aberration
the central FORT usually contains 106 trapped atoms. In the presence of the spherical
aberration, the other micro-traps usually have 2

105 atoms at 70µK temperature.

According to our numerical simulations, the spherical aberration contributions from
the telescope lenses can also alter the intensity pattern close to the focal plane of the
primary lens. Our telescope lenses are not corrected for the spherical aberration. To
demonstrate this point the meniscus lens was replaced with an aspheric lens corrected
for spherical aberrations so that the primary lens did not alter the wave front because
of the spherical aberration. Diﬀerent combinations of lenses that made up the telescope
were tested, however all of them showed a similar pattern. Thus, here we shall present
only one set up in which we used two plano convex lenses, both with 12.7cm focal
length. The separation of the telescope lenses was initially set equal to 24cm and was
then decreased in 3mm steps. Fig. 3 shows the observed intensities along the optical
axis of the primary lens as the telescope separation was varied. An oﬀset has been
added to each proﬁle to improve the readability. The sequence from the top is in order
of increasing distance between the telescope lenses. This ﬁgure shows that a micro
trap is created from the central FORT and starts to move away from it as we increase
the separation of the telescope lenses. This is because as the beam size on the second
lens increases so does the spherical aberration. From Fig. 3 it can be noted that after
the seventh step of increment in the telescope separation a second micro-trap emerges
from the central FORT and moves away. This happens while the ﬁrst micro-trap has
travelled far enough so that atoms are no longer loaded into it. The second micro-trap
moves away with increasing telescope lens separation until the ﬁfteenth step when a
third micro-trap emerges from the central trap and starts to travel towards the second
micro-trap. These two micro-traps coexist for a few more increments in the separation
until the second micro-trap fails to load atoms. Since less atoms are loaded into the
micro-traps of Fig. 3 compared to Fig. 2, we infer that the meniscus lens produces more
spherical aberration than the telescope lenses.

5. Conclusion

We have shown that the intensity distribution produced by a lens that is not corrected
for spherical aberration can be used to prepare a potential to realize micro-optical traps.
A beam from a CO2 laser focused with such a lens was employed to load Rb 87 atoms
into the micro-optical traps formed by the intensity maxima of the spherical aberration
pattern. Such high density (1013 atoms/cm3) samples of cold atoms are of interest
for a wide range of experimental studies including evaporative cooling, cold collisions

and quantum information processing with ultra cold Rydberg atoms [23]. Furthermore,
the variable separation of the micro-traps could be used to control the dipole-dipole
interactions between the atoms in adjacent traping sites. Also increasing the separation
of the micro-traps up to a few hundred microns makes the task of individually addressing
the diﬀerent micro-traps relatively straight forward with existing optical techniques.
These properties are of great interest for quantum information processing proposals
for neutral atoms. Another possible experiment would be to construct an atom
interferometer using the micro-traps. One could take a BEC formed using evaporative
cooling in a single focused laser beam [24] and then by changing the separation of the
telescope lenses split oﬀ a sub group of BEC atoms. By simply setting the telescope
separation back to the initial value the two BEC groups can be recombined making
an interference pattern which depends on the phase diﬀerence accumulated between
the wavefunctions. An analysis of such an interference pattern releases information
about the mechanisms eﬀecting the phase of the transported BEC. For example, if the
second CO2 beam propagates in the vertical direction a phase will be induced to the
wavefunction proportional to the change in the gravitational potential of the moving
group. Therefore the ﬁnal interference pattern contains information that could be used
to probe gravity.

Abstract

We characterize the avoided crossings in a two-parameter, time-periodic
system which has been the basis for a wide variety of experiments. By
studying these avoided crossings in the near-integrable regime, we are
able to determine scaling laws for the dependence of their characteristic
features on the non-integrability parameter. As an application of these
results, the inﬂuence of avoided crossings on dynamical tunneling is de-
scribed and applied to the recent realization of multiple-state tunneling
in an experimental system.

Introduction

Avoided crossings of eigenvalue curves are generic features of quantum systems
with non-integrable classical counterparts [1]. Their appearance allows for a
wide variety of interesting, purely quantum mechanical, phenomena including
chaos-assisted tunneling [2], the adiabatic exchange of eigenstate character [3],
and generally provides the mechanism by which underlying classical chaos aﬀects
the dynamics of a quantum system [4]. Their existence is also responsible for
perhaps the most well-known result in the ﬁeld of quantum chaos, the non-
Poisson statistical distribution of level spacings in “chaotic” quantum systems
[5].

In systems with two parameters, an avoided crossing along any curve in pa-
rameter space can be associated to a “diabolical point” at which two eigenvalue
surfaces become degenerate [6]. The conical shape of the two eigenvalue surfaces
in the vicinity of such a diabolical point ensures the characteristic hyperbolic
behavior of two eigenvalues along any curve in parameter space passing near,
but not through, the diabolical point. In the particular case of a near-integrable
system, one parameter may be ﬁxed to be zero leaving the system integrable for
all values of the other parameter. Eigencurves will freely cross under variation
of the latter parameter, thus creating diabolical points of the associated eigen-
value surfaces when viewed in the full two-parameter space. As we show here,
this type of diabolical point is important because perturbation theory can be

1

applied to characterize the conical shape and therefore characterize the avoided
crossings of the near-integrable system.

In this paper we study the particular two-parameter, near-integrable system

of a harmonically driven pendulum:

H(κ, λ) = p2 + κ cos θ + λ [cos (θ + ωt) + cos (θ

ωt)] .

This “one-and-a-half” degree-of-freedom system is one of the simplest types of
classical systems to exhibit chaos. It is of signiﬁcant experimental interest in
quantum mechanics since it has been implemented in a number of studies [7, 8,
9, 10, 12] through the use of cold atom optics, particularly in investigations of
multiple-state dynamical tunneling [12]. Theoretically, it provides a convenient
framework for studying the avoided crossings of near-integrable systems since
for λ

0 the system is the integrable pendulum Hamiltonian.

In the following, we study the properties of avoided crossings for the driven
pendulum with the use of Floquet theory. An avoided crossing of two Floquet
eigenvalue curves (for λ
= 0) can be associated to a level crossing of the in-
tegrable pendulum (λ = 0) system and is characterized by the dependence of
its closest approach on the non-integrability parameter λ. For small values of
λ, we ﬁnd that the spacing exhibits a power law dependence with an integer
power. A modiﬁed degenerate perturbation theory is then applied to verify this
dependence and associate it to the direct or indirect coupling of the associated
integrable eigenstates. We then use the perturbation results to elucidate a mul-
tiple state dynamical tunneling process in the vicinity of an avoided crossing
and apply the results to the particular achievement of this tunneling in an atom
optics experiment. We ﬁnally show the association of this avoided crossing to a
nearby diabolical point.

In Section 2 we present the model Hamiltonian under consideration in the
paper, including a description of the system’s classical dynamics. Section 3
presents the quantum dynamics of the model system, with a brief review of Flo-
quet analysis. Avoided crossings of the model system are investigated in detail in
Section 4, ﬁrst numerically, then with the perturbation theory results presented
in Appendix A. We review the implications of avoided crossings on dynamical
tunneling in Section 5 and demonstrate the origin of those avoided crossings in
a particular experimental system. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks.

2 The Model Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian we consider consists of a particle moving in the presence of a
harmonically-modulated, spatially-periodic potential. It can be written in the
form

H ′(p′, x, t′) =

+ V1 cos(kx) + V2 cos(kx) cos(ω′t′),

(2)

2

p′
2m

where p′ is the momentum and x the position of a particle of mass m, t′ is time,
V1 is the amplitude of the spatially periodic potential, V2 is the amplitude of the

2

6
modulation potential and ω′ is the frequency of the modulation potential. The
experimental implementation of quantum systems of with this type of Hamil-
tonian was ﬁrst proposed by Graham, Schlautmann, and Zoller in 1992 [7] and
then achieved by Raizen et. al. [8, 9, 12], and Hensinger et. al. [10].
It is useful to change to dimensionless units. We deﬁne: p = p

explicitly as two travelling waves. Note that momentum is measured in units of

ω (ν

The classical phase space of a time-periodic one-and-a-half degree-of-freedom
system such as H(p, θ, t) can be visualized by a strobe plot of the trajectories at
times t = ν 2π
Z). A strobe plot of phase space trajectories for the system
governed by Hamiltonian H(p, θ, t) is shown in Figure 1.a with parameters κ =
7.8 and λ = 0. (For the case of λ = 0, the system is independent of time and
could be visualized with an ordinary parametric plot of phase space, however
we plot the strobed phase space for convenience of comparison to the perturbed
system). Because this system is integrable, all orbits lie on tori (in either the
regions of the pendulum’s libration or rotation) and the phase space is absent
of chaos. Figure 1.b shows a strobe plot of the phase space with parameters
κ = 7.8, λ = 0.5, and ω = 24. The travelling waves in the modulation term have

phase velocities v =

where ˙θ = v. Although much of the orbit structure of the integrable system is
preserved, the tori with rational winding numbers have been destroyed, giving
rise to a self-similar set of daughter resonance structures (see, for example, the

4 ). Regions of chaos surround these resonances,
most visibly near the separatrix of the pendulum resonance.

pendulum eigenfunctions and the corresponding classical orbits). As we will see,
the Husimi distributions of the Floquet states lie directly on the orbit structures
of the classical phase space.

4 Avoided crossings

The Floquet pendulum is integrable and its eigenvalues Ωn,q(κ), shown in Fig-
ure 2.b, cross under the variation of κ. For any nonzero λ, however, the system
represented by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (5) is non-integrable and the approach
of any two (same parity) Floquet eigenvalues under variation of κ results in
an avoided crossing. This well-known result, the no-crossing theorem, was ﬁrst
proven by von Neumann and Wigner for eigenvalues of generic Hermitian matri-
ces [1]. They also showed that adiabatic passage of two quantum states through
an avoided crossing leads to an exchange of character.
(In a two-parameter
system, this exchange can be related to the partial circuit of a diabolical point
[6], while in single parameter systems it can be related to exceptional points in
the complex parameter plane [18]). Avoided crossings of Floquet eigenvalues in
the fundamental zone, which generally involve states localized in well-separated
regions of the phase space, will therefore allow a wide variety of interesting
quantum dynamical phenonomena, including adiabatic transitions and tunnel-
ing.

In this section, we will consider the near-integrable regime (0 < λ << κ), in
which a clear association can be made between the Floquet eigenstates of the
= 0) and those of the Floquet pendulum (λ = 0). In this
perturbed system (λ
regime, the Floquet eigenvalues will follow nearly the same dependence on κ
as the unperturbed eigenvalues seen in Figure 2.b, except in the vicinity of an
avoided crossing. For κ values suﬃciently far from these avoided crossings, we

Three avoided crossings of Floquet eigenvalues in the fundamental zone with λ =
2 are shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5 with Husimi plots of the corresponding
5
Floquet eigenstates overplotted on the ﬁgures. The dotted lines shown are the
eigenvalues of the unperturbed Floquet pendulum. These plots were created
by numerically calculating the time-strobed Floquet states at a sequence of κ
values. With each step forward in κ, the new states were associated to those of
the previous step by calculating the maximum overlap and verifying continuity
of the eigenvalues. In the case that two Floquet eigenvalues crossed between κ-
steps, the size of the step was reduced and the process repeated until no crossing
occurred.

Each of these three avoided crossings involves one Floquet eigenstate local-
ized within the pendulum resonance at p = 0 and another localized outside of

These particular avoided crossings were chosen as representative examples with
∆qαβ = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Some general characteristics of these avoided crossings deserve attention.
First, the “exchange of character” between the two states is evident in the
nα, qαi
evolution of the Husimi distributions with κ. The associations
well before the avoided crossing become
and
nβ, qβi
well after. For κ values at the avoided crossing, the two
and
Floquet states are superpositions of the asymptotic states. Second, there is
quite a disparity of scale among the three avoided crossings. In particular, the
minimum eigenvalue spacing ∆αβ, deﬁned by

position κac of the minimum spacing (which we will henceforth call the “position
of the avoided crossing”), is not necessarily equal to the position κ0 of the

unperturbed crossing. Indeed, it seems that for ∆qαβ 6

of avoided crossings, we see excellent agreement. We have also veriﬁed the
predictions of perturbation theory for a number of other avoided crossings in
this system (as well as those in systems with diﬀerent values of ω), ﬁnding
similar agreement.

A number of other characteristics of the avoided crossings can be determined
from our perturbation analysis. Substituting Ω(N )
into Eq.
(22), we ﬁnd that at the position of the avoided crossing, the two perturbed
Floquet eigenstates (to lowest order in λ) become an equal superposition of the
two associated Floquet pendulum states, i.e.

p0 may undergo time-
periodic dynamical tunneling, across the central resonance (and all intervening
KAM tori) to the opposite momentum region at p

for this behavior is the existence of a near-degenerate and opposite parity pair
of Floquet eigenstates which each have localization near p0 and
If the
Floquet eigenvalues of these two states are far from any avoided crossings, the
tunneling dynamics are well described by a two-state process exactly analogous
to the tunneling through a potential barrier in the time-independent double well
system [20]. In the vicinity of an avoided crossing, however, the dynamics are
inﬂuenced by a third state with partial localization in the regions of
p0 and the
time-evolution takes on a more complicated beating behavior. In this section
we analyze this tunneling behavior in the perturbative regime (λ small) and

Although the experimental system cannot be considered to be in a perturbative
regime, we identify the diabolical point associated to the relevant avoided cross-

characterizes this avoided crossing quite well.

Between these two extremes of regular two-state and three-state tunneling,
at other values of the parameter κ along the avoided crossing, the tunneling
takes on a beating behavior due to the two eigenvalue diﬀerences between the
odd-parity state and each even-parity state. An example of this (the evolution

classical chaos. Classical chaos in a non-perturbative regime will certainly in-
troduce additional complications to the quantum dynamical tunneling process
which we have not investigated here (notably the interaction between tunneling
through dynamical barriers and free evolution in a region dominated by chaos
[27]); and avoided crossings will become larger, more numerous, and may over-
lap, leading to interaction of more than three relevant states. However, as we
have seen in this section, the basic mechanism for “tunneling enhancement”
does not necessarily require global chaos but only the non-integrability which
leads to avoided crossings. Indeed, for the non-integrability parameter used in
2), the classical phase space has only small regions of
this section (λ = 5
chaos.

5.2 Analysis of a Tunneling experiment

≈

≈

→

As an application of the tunneling results of the previous section, we consider
the experiment of Steck, Oskay and Raizen [12]. The Hamiltonian implemented
in this atom-optics experiment depends on a single parameter, α, and can be
considered a special case of that in Eq. (5) by setting κ
α/2.17 (up to a
sign diﬀerence which can be removed by a π-translation of the angle variable),
λ = κ/2, and ω
6.04. It should be noted that this system is not connected to
the Floquet pendulum system since λ is not an independent parameter. Instead,
in the limit λ, κ

0, the free particle Hamiltonian is obtained.
The primary result of the experiments detailed in [12] is the observation of
dynamical tunneling, between two resonance islands in the classical phase space
3), which exhibits oscillation frequencies dependent on the
(located at p
parameter value considered and independent of the modulation frequency. In
particular, for a range of parameter values, the observed tunneling oscillations
were dominated by two primary frequencies. The Floquet eigenvalue curves
for the experimental system are shown in Figure 10, and the experimentally
observed tunneling frequencies are shown in Figure 11.b, overplotted on the
diﬀerences of eigenvalues between three particular Floquet eigenstates. These
three states exhibit signiﬁcant localization in the region of the classical resonance
islands at some values of the parameter κ [11]. The experimental frequencies
are well predicted by only two of these diﬀerences, namely ∆Ωαγ and ∆Ωβγ.

The oscillations seen in the parameter region κ

[3, 4.75] are due to the
existence of an avoided crossing between the eigenvalues of the even-parity states
labelled
. As can be seen in the overplotted Husimi distributions,
these two even-parity states originate at small κ values from two disconnected
0, and the other at the
regions of the phase space, the ﬁrst residing at p
positions of the classical resonance islands where the odd parity state
also
has its primary support. In passing through this avoided crossing, the odd-parity
state retains its original character, while the two even-parity states become
mutual superpositions of their small κ character. It is clear that this avoided
crossing is not of the ideal form considered in the perturbative regime. The
superposing eﬀects of this avoided crossing are extend well beyond the minimum

Despite these complications, we can identify the dynamical tunneling in the
parameter region κ
[2.5, 4.75] to be a three-state process involving those states
shown in Figure 11.a. As predicted by the results of the previous section, the
observed tunneling frequencies involve only diﬀerences in Floquet eigenvalue
between the odd parity state and the two even parity states. A direct com-
parison of the oscillations from [12] with the numerically calculated evolution
under ˆU(T ) is shown in Figure 12 for the
of an initially localized state
values κ = 3.68 and 4.50. Neglecting dissipation and a momentum oﬀset of
the experimental values (due to the fact that not all atoms contributing to the
average are participating in the dynamics), there is good agreement in the sec-
ond case. In the ﬁrst case, and for all parameter values between κ = 3 and 4,
the experiment seems to pick up only one of the underlying frequencies (∆Ωγβ,
while the numerics predict nearly equal contributions from ∆Ωγβ and ∆Ωαγ.
It was noted in Reference [28] that the detection of fewer than the predicted
number of frequency contributions to the tunneling behavior was also found in
another experimental system [10].

Finally, we would like to consider the origin of the avoided crossing involved
in the dynamical tunneling observed in [12]. Figure 13 shows the avoided cross-
ing of Figure 11.a lying on the eigenvalue surfaces Ωα and Ωβ in κ
λ space.
One can see that these two surfaces meet at a diabolical point on the κ = 0
2.8. Numerical analysis shows that, in the neighborhood of the
axis, where λ
diabolical point, the minimum spacing between the two eigenvalue surfaces is
linearly dependent on κ, with

This result is in good agreement with a perturbation analysis similar to that
of Appendix A, but with κ as the small expansion parameter. The predicted
minimum spacing from such an analysis yields

where the matrix element must be numerically calculated as the coupling of
the two degenerate Floquet eigenstates of the (κ = 0.0,λ = 2.8) system through
ˆV ′ = cos ˆθ, the coeﬃcient of κ. Although the avoided crossing in the experiment
(Figure 11.a) appears at a parameter value outside the range of validity of
perturbation theory, the observed minimum spacing between ∆Ωα and ∆Ωβ
agrees with Eq. 38 to within a factor of two.

6 Conclusions

We have shown that the minimum spacing of avoided crossings in a near-
integrable time-periodic system, and therefore the minimally separated “ridges”
of the double-cone structures surrounding a diabolical point, exhibits a power
law dependence on the non-integrability parameter, with integer power. A mod-
iﬁed degenerate perturbation theory has allowed us to relate the coeﬃcient of
this dependence to the direct or indirect coupling of the two related unper-
turbed Floquet states through the perturbation operator, and the integer power
to the number of “photon energies” ω connecting their related energy eigenval-
ues. Moreover, the perturbation analysis predicts a qualitatively identical struc-
ture for all avoided crossings which allows us to characterize generically their
aﬀect on dynamical tunneling. This description was applied to a particular
avoided crossing generating multiple-state tunneling oscillations in an experi-
mental system, and its connection to a nearby diabolical point was revealed.
It is hoped that these results will provide guidance for the development of new
experimental setups which intend to use avoided crossings in the realization of
multiple state tunneling processes and adiabatic transitions, or the preparation
of Schr¨odinger’s cat type superposed states.

A Perturbation Theory for Avoided Crossings

The Floquet pendulum system ˆH 0
F (κ) has a two-fold degeneracy at κ = κ0 where
two eigenstates
have eigenvalues
nβ(κ0), qβi
and
Ωα(κ0) = Ωβ(κ0). We will use a modiﬁed degenerate perturbation theory to lift
this degeneracy at the κ-position of the resulting avoided crossing when λ > 0.
In light of the discussion in Section 4.2, we write the Floquet Hamiltonian as

nα(κ0), qαi

α0
|

i ≡ |

i ≡ |

β0
|

ˆHF (κ) = ˆH 0

F + δ ˆHF ∆κ(λ) + λ ˆV ,

(39)

∂κ = cos ˆθ with the
where we now write ˆH 0
simplifying assumption that this operator is diagonal in the unperturbed basis.
This is equivalent to the assumption that the unperturbed eigenvalue curves are
linear in the small region of κ under consideration. We expand ∆κ(λ), setting

F (κ0). The operator δ ˆHF is ∂ ˆHF

F ≡

turbed states. At this order, we will make the distinct assignments

Abstract

We derive an approximate expression for a “radiative potential” which can be used to calculate

QED strong Coulomb ﬁeld radiative corrections to energies and electric dipole (E1) transition am-

plitudes in many-electron atoms with an accuracy of a few percent. The expectation value of the

radiative potential gives radiative corrections to the energies. Radiative corrections to E1 ampli-

tudes can be expressed in terms of the radiative potential and its energy derivative (the low-energy

theorem): the relative magnitude of the radiative potential contribution is

α3Z 2 ln(1/α2Z 2),

∼

while the sum of other QED contributions is

α3(Zi + 1)2, where Zi is the ion charge; that

∼
is, for neutral atoms (Zi = 0) the radiative potential contribution exceeds other contributions

Z 2 times. The advantage of the radiative potential method is that it is very simple and can

∼
be easily incorporated into many-body theory approaches: relativistic Hartree-Fock, conﬁguration

interaction, many-body perturbation theory, etc. As an application we have calculated the ra-

diative corrections to the energy levels and E1 amplitudes as well as their contributions (-0.33%

and 0.42%, respectively) to the parity non-conserving (PNC) 6s-7s amplitude in neutral cesium

(Z=55). Combining these results with the QED correction to the weak matrix elements (-0.41%) we

obtain the total QED correction to the PNC 6s-7s amplitude, (-0.32

0.03)%. The cesium weak

INTRODUCTION

The precision of calculations and measurements of phenomena of heavy neutral atoms

has reached the level where strong-ﬁeld QED radiative corrections are observable. The most

striking example is parity nonconservation (PNC) in the neutral cesium atom (Z = 55)

where the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld radiative corrections “saved” the standard model of particle

physics (this dramatic story may be found, e.g., in the review [1]; see also the original papers

for the measurement [2, 3] and calculations of strong-ﬁeld radiative corrections [4, 5, 6, 7,

8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]).

While there is an abundance of highly-accurate calculations of radiative corrections to

phenomena of single-electron or few-electron atoms, only a handful of calculations have been

performed for atoms with many electrons. A proper account of the many-body eﬀects in

calculations of radiative corrections to phenomena of many-electron atoms, including the

PNC amplitude, is lacking.

The ﬁrst estimates of radiative corrections to energies of an external electron in heavy

neutral atoms were performed more than 20 years ago [16]. A semi-empirical formula for

the s-wave radiative correction to energy levels (the Lamb shift) was derived. The relative

magnitude of this correction is

Z 2α3 ln (1/Z 2α2). It rapidly increases with the nuclear

∼

charge Z and was important in making a very accurate prediction of the francium (Z =

87) spectrum (measurements performed after the theoretical prediction [16] agree with the

calculated energy levels to better than 0.1%). Calculations of the Lamb shift in alkali

and coinage metal atoms were performed in Ref.

[17] using local Dirac-Slater potentials;

importantly, it was demonstrated that the ratio of energy shifts arising from the Uehling

potential and self-energy in neutral atoms is the same as that in hydrogen-like ions, verifying

the authors’ earlier estimates [18]. Calculations of the Lamb shift in neutral alkali atoms

were also performed in Ref.

[19] using local atomic potentials. In our recent works [6] we

used a parametric potential ﬁtted to reproduce radiative corrections in hydrogen-like ions

to perform approximate numerical calculations of radiative corrections to the energy levels,

electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes, and a rough estimate of radiative corrections

to the PNC amplitude in cesium. Recently, calculations of radiative corrections in local

eﬀective atomic potentials have been performed for E1 amplitudes in neutral alkalis in Ref.

[20] and for the PNC amplitude in Cs in Ref. [14].

It is well-known that many-body eﬀects (exchange interaction, core relaxation and po-

larization, correlations) may be very important. For any perturbation located at small

distances, e.g. the ﬁeld (volume) isotopic shift, the matrix elements for an electron with

orbital angular momentum l > 0 are dominated by the many-body eﬀects mentioned above.

In this case one cannot guarantee the magnitude or even the sign of the shift when one

does a model potential calculation. Moreover, even for the s-wave, many-body corrections

can change the results by a factor of 2. QED radiative corrections also come from small

distances, and one may expect a similar situation. Therefore, recent calculations of QED

corrections in model atomic potentials cannot guarantee results of high accuracy. Indeed,

in a recent work [21] the importance of a proper account of core relaxation in calculations

of the radiative shift due to the Uehling potential was demonstrated for neutral cesium.

In the present work we suggest a simple radiative potential approach which allows one

to calculate radiative corrections to many-electron atoms including many-body eﬀects. In

particular, our method is valid for calculations of the Lamb shift and radiative corrections

to E1 amplitudes. We claim an accuracy of a few percent for calculations of radiative

corrections to s-wave energy levels, s-p intervals, and s-p E1 amplitudes for neutral cesium

using the radiative potential approach. We believe that our approach is complementary to

the direct Feynman diagram calculations in a model potential.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we derive an approximate ab initio for-

mula for the radiative potential for Zα

1. Then we reﬁne this potential to include higher

≪

orders in Zα using published results for hydrogen-like ions [22]. In Section III we describe

the procedure for calculations of QED radiative corrections to electric dipole amplitudes. In

Section III A we derive the low-energy theorem: the vertex and normalization corrections

are expressed in terms of ∂Σ

∂E where Σ is the electron self-energy operator. Further discussion
is presented in Section III B. The dominating contribution is due to the radiative corrections

to electron wave functions produced by the radiative potential. The relative value of this

contribution is

α3Z 2 ln(1/α2Z 2) both in ions and neutral atoms. It is shown in Section

∼

III C that the sum of all other terms (the vertex correction, the normalization correction,

and part of the self-energy operator which can be presented as ΣA = (H

E)A + A(H

E)

−

−

and does not contribute to the energy shifts) is

α3(Zi + 1)2 where Zi is the ion charge, H

is the atomic electron Hamiltonian, and A is an operator deﬁned in Section III C. Therefore,

in neutral atoms (Zi = 0) this sum is Z 2 times smaller than the radiative potential contri-

∼

bution and may be neglected. As an application we calculate in Section IV the radiative

corrections to the energy levels and E1 amplitudes in neutral cesium including many-body

eﬀects: core relaxation, core polarization by the photon electric ﬁeld, and correlation correc-

tions. In Section V we calculate the radiative corrections to energy levels and E1 amplitudes

contributing to the parity non-conserving 6s-7s amplitude in Cs. Finally, the conclusion for

the radiative potential approach for the calculations of the QED radiative corrections to

energies, E1 amplitudes, and the PNC amplitude is given in Section VI.

II. THE RADIATIVE POTENTIAL

We deﬁne a radiative potential ˆL such that its average value coincides with the radiative

corrections to energies,

ﬁeld, ˆΣ(r, r′, E), and the local vacuum polarization operator comprised of the lowest-order

in Zα Uehling potential ΦU (r) and the higher-order Wichmann-Kroll potential. Diagrams

for the radiative energy shifts are presented in Fig. 1.

vacuum polarization. Double line denotes a bound electron; wavy line denotes a photon.

The actual problem is the calculation of the self-energy Σ(r, r′, E) contribution to the

radiative potential. This calculation can be divided into two parts: one in which the electron

4

interaction with virtual photons of high-frequency is considered, and one in which virtual

photons of low-frequency is considered. In the high-frequency case the external ﬁeld (the

nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld) need only be included to ﬁrst order (vertex diagram). In the case of

a free electron the vertex diagram gives the electric f (q2) and magnetic g(q2) formfactors

presented, for example, in the book [23]. The calculations of the contributions of f (q2) and
g(q2) to the radiative potential ˆL are similar to the calculation of the Uehling contribution

presented in [23]. Therefore, we present the calculations very brieﬂy. We also present

the well-known results for the Uehling potential for comparison with the f (q2) and g(q2)

contributions calculated in this work.

The expression for the electric formfactor (8) contains a low-frequency cut-oﬀ parameter

λ in the argument of the logarithm.

In the standard calculation of the energy shift [23]

this parameter is assumed to be in the interval (Zα)2m

λ

m. After addition of the

≪

≪

low-frequency contribution the parameter λ cancels out. To minimize the low-frequency

contribution we select λ of the order of the electron binding energy in atoms, λ

(Zα)2m,

∼

which is the smallest possible value that can be taken as the border for the high-frequency

region (one can use free-electron Green’s functions to calculate the electron formfactors,

used above, for frequencies ω

(Zα)2m). This gives ln (4m2/λ2) = 4 ln (1/Zα) + const,

where the constant const does not depend on Z for Zα

high-frequency contribution allows us to determine the electric formfactor contribution with

logarithmic accuracy. The uncertainty is due to the omitted low-frequency contribution for

this term.

to calculate it.

The constant in the electric formfactor can be found from a comparison with calculations

of the Lamb shift for the high-energy levels (principal quantum number n

1) in hydrogen-

like ions. Indeed, the energy of an external electron in a many-electron atom is extremely

small, E

10−5mc2. Therefore, we need the self-energy operator Σ(E

0). The short-

range character of Σ(r, r′, 0) means that we can use unscreened Coulomb Green’s functions

For very light atoms (Z

calculations presented in the book [23], yielding const

0.63. However, this result is not

≈ −

applicable for Z

10. In this case we have to use the results of all-orders in Zα calculations

≥

for hydrogen-like ions presented in Ref.

[22]. To reproduce the results of [22] (and leave

some room for a low-frequency contribution discussed below) we select this logarithm in

the form 4 ln (1/Zα + 0.5), where a small constant 0.5 is added into the argument of the

logarithm. This selection gives an accuracy

10% for all important applications: the s-

∼
wave self-energy, s-p intervals (which are needed to calculate the parity violation eﬀects),

and ﬁne structure intervals for any Z. However, the radiative shifts for p-waves (and higher

waves) are small and sensitive to the low frequency contribution. To make our calculation

complete and improve the accuracy to 1% we should consider this contribution too.

6

A consistent calculation of the low-frequency contribution to the non-local self-energy op-

erator Σ(r, r′, E) using Coulomb or parametric potential Green’s functions is a complicated

task. However, at the present level of experimental accuracy this low-frequency problem is

not of immediate importance. It is much easier to ﬁt this small low-frequency contribution

using a parametric potential Φl(r). A typical frequency in the low-frequency contribution

is

∼

E1s; therefore, the range of this potential is about the size of the 1s orbital, aB/Z.

To reproduce the p-level radiative energy shifts we use the following expression for the low-

frequency contribution

Φl(r) =

B(Z)

(9)

where e is the proton charge and B(Z) = 0.074 + 0.35Zα is a coeﬃcient ﬁtted to reproduce

the radiative shifts for the high Coulomb p-levels calculated in [22].

Finally, we should introduce one more correction which becomes important for very heavy

atoms, Z > 80. The potential (8) is not applicable for very small distances, r

Zαrc. In-

≪

deed, we used an expression for the electric formfactor of a free electron. However, at very

small distances the electron potential energy Zα/r

m and we should use an expression

for an oﬀ-mass-shell formfactor f (p, p′) instead of f (

q2). The formfactor f (p, p′) leads to a

non-local expression Σ(r, r′, E) for r

Zαrc instead of the local potential (8). Integration

of an electron wave function ψ with a non-local operator (

Σ(r, r′, E)ψ(r′)d3r′) makes the

W C (r). The

Wichmann-Kroll potential (12) gives a very small contribution which may be noticeable

(

1%) only for Z > 80. (This conﬁrms our conclusion [6] that the contribution of higher

∼
orders into the vacuum polarization potential is so small that it is unobservable in neutral

atoms: for the cesium atom the Wichmann-Kroll potential gives a contribution to s-waves

about 50 times smaller than the Uehling potential contribution; moreover, the Uehling

potential itself gives only about 10% of the total radiative correction for s-waves and a very

small contribution for higher waves.)

Note that our ﬁtting coeﬃcient in the electric formfactor contribution A(Z, r)

1 and

≈

the coeﬃcient in the low-frequency contribution B is small, therefore the semi-empirical ra-

diative potential (11) is always close to the result of the direct Feynman diagram calculation

ΦU (r) + Φg(r) + Φλ

f (r). It may look surprising that the radiative potential obtained in the

approximation Zα

1 gives energy shifts which are close to the all-orders results. However,

≪

the higher-order corrections to the energy shifts are mainly due to the relativistic electron

wave functions which we take into account exactly when calculating the matrix elements.

Indeed, the Dirac wave function diverges at small distances r < aB/Z:

In Table I we compare the self-energy for 5s, 5p1/2, and 5p3/2 levels in hydrogen-like ions

calculated using the potential Φg(r) + Φf (r) + Φl(r) with those of Ref. [22]. It is seen that

neutral atoms. However, in practice the results are good for any n > 1. Moreover, the

potential Φrad(r) even gives the 1s energy with reasonable accuracy,

10%. Note that to

calculate parity violation we mainly need to reproduce high s-level shifts in Cs (Z = 55), Tl

(Z = 81), and Fr (Z = 87); the p-level shifts are very small and not important.

The above calculations (and those of Ref.

[22]) were performed in the Coulomb ﬁeld

of a point-like nucleus Φ(r) = Ze/r. The small correction due to ﬁnite nuclear size can

be taken into account using integration over a realistic charge density for the nucleus,

B. The radiative potential in atomic calculations

The radiative potential we have derived from radiative shifts in hydrogen-like ions can

be used in calculations of radiative shifts in ions and neutral atoms for all Z and for any

number of electrons.

Indeed, all electron wave functions with energy E

mc2 are proportional to the zero-

energy Coulomb wave functions in the area r

rc, since the energy E may be neglected

in the Dirac equation and the potential is unscreened in this region. Therefore, the ratio

of the matrix elements of the radiative potential will be proportional to the ratio of the

electron densities near the origin (at a given j, l). This is the reason why one may use

≪

∼

parametric potentials ﬁtted to reproduce Lamb-shifts in hydrogen-like ions (for principal

9

quantum numbers n

1). Any potential of the range

rc will give the same results. The

≫

∼

radiative potentials Eqs. (6,10) belong to this class. This also explains the conclusion of

Ref.

[17] that the ratio of the self-energy contribution to the Uehling contribution is the

same in hydrogen-like ions and neutral atoms calculated in Dirac-Slater potentials.

The magnetic formfactor potential Eq. (7) is a long-range one. However, it decays rapidly

and its matrix elements are still determined by small distances r

aB/Z where all the wave

∼

functions with principal quantum numbers n

1 and given j, l are proportional (since the

energy

En| ≪ |

E1s|

|

and may be neglected in the area r

aB/Z). Thus, the radiative shifts

at a given j, l are still proportional to the electron density in the vicinity of the nucleus (1/n3

≫

∼

in the Coulomb case). Numerical data presented in Ref.

[23] show that this statement is

accurate to a few percent for n > 1 (exact for n

1).

≫

Our semi-empirical radiative potential was derived in the ﬁeld of the nucleus. In atoms

there is an electron density contribution to the radiative potential. This can be found by

integration of the point-charge radiative potential over the electron density (as in the ﬁnite

nuclear size calculation). It is easy to show that this contribution is very small. The elec-

tron density contribution is suppressed Z times relative to the nuclear charge contribution.

Indeed, to ﬁnd the energy shift we need to integrate the radiative potential with a squared

external electron wave function ψ2(r). For the nuclear contribution ψ2

ψ2(rc); for the
ψ2(aB), since the radius of the electron charge density is

∼

electron density contribution ψ2

∼

of the order of the Bohr radius aB. For an external s-wave electron in a neutral atom the
ratio ψ2(rc)/ψ2(aB)

Z. Thus, the nuclear contribution is Z times larger than the electron

∼

density contribution. A more elaborate estimate using the WKB semiclassical electron wave

function and the Thomas-Fermi electron density conﬁrms this simple estimate.

Note that to estimate the electron density contribution to the self-energy operator we

can use a semiclassical expression for Σ derived in [25]:

Here

expression is valid for r > aB/Z. Again, an estimate based on Eq. (14) shows that the

electron density contribution is Z times smaller than the nuclear charge contribution.

Another conclusion from Eq.

(14) is that the self-energy operator is not sensitive to

the energy of a valence electron in the area r

Note that the asymptotics of the high-frequency contribution to Φf (r) are presented as

an illustration only. A correct (long-range) expression for large r is determined by the

contribution of low frequencies. However, numerically this long-range contribution is not

near the origin) to an accuracy

1% (see [22, 23]). This can be considered as an estimate

of the contribution of the long-range tail and the energy dependence of Σ(r, r′, E).

This long-range potential decreases faster than 1/r2 since the nuclear electrostatic potential

We see that the area mr < 1 is not important for the magnetic formfactor contribution.

As we pointed out in the previous section the expression (20) for the electric formfactor

contribution is not applicable for mr

Zα. Indeed, the short-range asymptotics (20) can

be obtained very easily using high-energy asymptotics of the vertex operator Γµ(p, p′, q)

where p and p′ are initial and ﬁnal electron 4-momenta, and q is the photon 4-momentum.

These asymptotics can be found, e.g., in [23]. In the case

For electron angular momentum j > 1/2, the short-range contributions of ΦU (r) and

III. ELECTROMAGNETIC E1 AMPLITUDES

Diagrams for radiative corrections to the electric dipole (E1) transition amplitude are

presented in Fig. 2. The magnitude of diﬀerent QED contributions to E1 amplitudes

depends on the virtual photon gauge. Corrections to E1 amplitudes in hydrogen-like ions

have been calculated with logarithmic accuracy (

α3Z 2 ln (1/α2Z 2)) in Ref.

[26].

It is

∼

pointed out there that in the Yennie gauge it is enough to take into account only those

corrections to the non-relativistic electron wave functions produced by the non-relativistic

radiative potential (containing δ(r)).

FIG. 2: Diagrams for radiative corrections to the E1 amplitude: (a),(b) self-energy; (c) vertex;

(d),(e) vacuum polarization; and (f) external photon polarization operator. Notations are the same

as in Fig. 1; dashed line with the cross denotes the laser driven external photon ﬁeld.

In neutral atoms there is an additional small parameter suppressing the external photon

vertex contribution (Fig. 2(c)). The binding energies of the valence electron and the external

photon frequency are extremely small in comparison with typical virtual photon frequencies.

This makes corrections to the electric dipole operator (from the electron anomalous magnetic

moment) and all contributions proportional to ∂Σ

∂E negligible (see Eq. (15)).

Therefore, the radiative potential approach should work in neutral atoms even better

13

than in hydrogen-like ions. One has only to add the radiative potential to the atomic

potential, calculate the electron wave functions and use them to calculate electric dipole

matrix elements.

It is convenient to perform the calculations in the length form for the

electric dipole operator (D = er).

In the following section (Section III A) we derive the low-energy theorem for the E1 am-

plitude (expressing the vertex contribution in terms of the self-energy). In Section III B we

explain the suppression of the vertex corrections and the validity of the radiative potential

approach. In Section III C we perform a standard subtraction to remove ultraviolet diver-

gences from the radiative corrections to the amplitude and estimate diﬀerent contributions.

A. Derivation of the low-energy theorem

For the contribution of the high-frequency virtual photons the low-energy theorem follows

from the Ward identity [23]

Γµ(p, p, 0) =

∂G−1(p)
∂pµ

,

where Γµ is the vertex operator, G−1 = γµpµ −
function, and M(p) is the mass (self-energy) operator in the momentum representaion. In

M(p) is the inverse electron Green’s

the momentum representation to the coordinate representation is accompanied by the anti-

symmetrization of the operators r and M since, generally speaking, they do not commute

(actually, this non-commutativity exists for the low-frequency contribution only). There is

also some diﬀerence in deﬁnitions of the mass operator M in [23] and the self-energy op-

erator Σ used in this work (extra Dirac matrix γ0; the matrix elements in [23] are deﬁned

using ψ = ψ†γ0, we use ψ†Σψ). Note that this low-energy theorem for the high-frequency

contribution is valid in any order of perturbation theory (including all orders in Zα) and

holds for the renormalized operators (similar to the Ward identity). One should add to Eq.

just have to use the relativistic radiation operator γµ exp (ikr) instead of the momentum

instead of Eqs. (26)-(29).)

There is another way to explain the suppression of the vertex contribution. The product

is small everywhere inside a neutral atom. The matrix element of r typically comes

from the distance r
therefore, in this region ∂Σ(r,r′,E)

aB. At this distance the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld is screened, Zef f ∼

cannot have Z 2 enhancement. On the other hand, at small

distances where the nuclear charge is unscreened, r is small. This can also be seen from the

vertex diagram itself where the operator r is locked inside the virtual photon loop located at

a small distance from the nucleus. There is no such suppression for the radiative correction

to the electron wave function. The radiative potential changes the energy of the electron.

16

This in turn changes the large distance asymptotics of the electron wave function and the

matrix element of r.

In the approximate expression for the radiative potential we use in this work ∂Σ(r,r′,E)

and so there are no vertex or normalization contributions. The ﬁrst two terms in the radiative

the radiative corrections to the matrix elements of short-range operators like the weak and
hyperﬁne interactions. In this case the states with En ∼
contribution and use of the radiative potential designed to give matrix elements between

¯hc/rtypical > ω give a signiﬁcant

low-energy electron states is not justiﬁed.

The derivation (and result) of the low-energy theorem we have presented above is similar

to that of the low-energy theorem for correlation corrections to the electric dipole amplitude

in our work [31]. The vertex (structural radiation) and normalization correlation corrections

are also proportional to ∂Σ

∂E and suppressed by a factor Evalence/Ecore ∼

1/10 where Evalence

and Ecore are ionization energies for the valence and core electrons. It is interesting to note

that for the correlation corrections the vertex and normalization contributions were found to

be numerically small for both long-range (electric dipole) and short-range (weak, hyperﬁne)

operators.

There is also a certain similarity between this theorem and the low-energy theorem (the

Low theorem) for bremsstrahlung (see, e.g., [23]). The main radiation comes from the

external particle ends of the scattering diagram and is expressed in terms of the elastic

scattering amplitude. The structural radiation (from inside the scattering vertex) is small

and is expressed in terms of the derivative of the elastic amplitude. In our case we consider

17

the radiation of a weakly bound electron (E < 0) which is not so diﬀerent from the radiation

of an unbound particle (E > 0) if the energy E is small.

C. Estimates of diﬀerent QED corrections

All terms in Eqs. (26,28,27,29) and (32,33,34) are ultraviolet divergent as κ tends to

inﬁnity. Therefore, we have to perform a subtraction of a standard counter term in the

expression for the self-energy operator,

IV. APPLICATIONS TO NEUTRAL CESIUM

In this section we apply the radiative potential method to calculate radiative corrections

to energy levels and electromagnetic amplitudes in the neutral cesium atom. We limit our

consideration to the s and p levels of the external electron which are important for the parity

violation calculation. All calculations are performed taking into account ﬁnite nuclear size.

A. Energies

To calculate the radiative corrections to the energy levels we add the radiative poten-

tial to the nuclear Coulomb potential and calculate the self-consistent direct and exchange

19

potentials obtained using Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) equations for the electron core. This

DHF potential includes the potential δV (“core relaxation”) which arises from the change

in the core electron wave functions due to the radiative potential. Then we calculate the

energy levels of the external electron in this DHF potential produced by the core electrons.

The next step is to include the correlation corrections. It is convenient to calculate these

corrections using the correlation potential method [31, 33] which takes into account all

second-order correlation corrections and three dominating series of higher-order diagrams

(screening of the electron-electron interaction, the hole-particle interaction, and iteration of

the correlation self-energy) to all orders in the residual Coulomb interaction. The non-local
and energy-dependent correlation potential ˆΣcorr(r, r′, E) is deﬁned by the equation for the

correlation correction to the electron energy δEcorr
; it is deﬁned in an
analogous way to the radiative potential, Eq. (1). We add ˆΣcorr to the Dirac-Hartree-Fock

potential to include it to all orders. The results of calculations for the radiative corrections

are presented in Table II.

It is seen that the many-body corrections change the result for the s-levels by

10% and

they change the sign and magnitude for p-levels. Our results for Uehling relaxation (not

explicitly presented) are in perfect agreement with those of Ref. [21].

The results are in agreement with our previous calculations [6] and lie within the range

spanned by model potential calculations of the 6s Lamb shift performed in Ref. [17] (from

15 to 27 cm−1) and Ref. [19] (from 13 to 23 cm−1). However, the accuracy of our present

work is higher,

B. E1 amplitudes

We use a similar method as that for the energies to calculate the radiative corrections to

the electromagnetic amplitudes between the s and p levels. First, we calculate the external

electron wave functions including the radiative potential and the core relaxation δV . Then

we use these wave functions to calculate the radiative corrections to the electromagnetic

amplitudes in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock approximation. At the second step we calculate the

eﬀect of the electron core polarization by the photon electric ﬁeld using the time-dependent

Hartree-Fock method. These core polarization corrections are often called the RPAE (ran-

dom phase approximation with exchange) corrections. At the ﬁnal step we use the correlation

potential method [31, 33] to calculate the correlation corrections to the radiative corrections.
In fact, to the required accuracy it is enougth to add ˆΣcorr to the Dirac-Hartree-Fock equa-

tions and calculate the external electron wave functions. Other correlation corrections are
proportional to ∂ ˆΣcorr

∂E and contribute about 1% only (the low-energy theorem; we mentioned
this at the end of Section III B). The results of the calculations for the radiative corrections

are presented in Table III. Following Ref.

[20], we present the results in terms of the di-

mensionless relative radiative corrections R to the electromagnetic amplitude deﬁned by the

Note that the radiative corrections for the 6s1/2 −

since these amplitudes are small and sensitive to any corrections to the DHF potential.

21

Unfortunately, we calculated but did not present the radiative corrections to the electro-

magnetic amplitudes in our previous paper [6]; we presented only their total contribution to

the parity violating amplitude. Anyway, the accuracy in our present work is higher (

1%).

In a recent work [20], direct calculations of the radiative corrections to electromagnetic

amplitudes in the neutral alkali atoms were performed. In particular, the radiative correction

to the 6s

6p amplitude in Cs was calculated using the local Kohn-Sham potential. In this

−

approach, the non-local exchange interaction is replaced by a semi-empirical local term that

depends on the electron density. Ref.

[20] also does not take into account many-body

corrections: core relaxation, RPAE, and correlation corrections. Nevertheless, 6s

6p is

a large “resonance” amplitude, and the many-body eﬀects should not be very signiﬁcant

here. Indeed, our Dirac-Hartree-Fock value R = 0.266 is very close to the result of Ref. [20]:

R = 0.261. We select our Dirac-Hartree-Fock value for comparison since it is the lowest-

order approximation we use (no RPAE or correlation corrections) and most similar to that

of Ref. [20]. However, the very small diﬀerence between the results is accidental. The result

of Ref.

[20] does not include the Uehling potential contribution (

10%), and one may

∼ −

also expect some diﬀerence due to the core relaxation eﬀect and the diﬀerent treatment of

∼

−

the exchange interaction.

number of neutrons. 98% of the sum is given by the terms n = 6, 7, 8, 9 explicitly presented

above. The result includes the many-body corrections to all matrix elements.

22

A. Contributions of energies and E1 amplitudes

Now it is very easy to calculate the contributions to the PNC amplitude from radiative

corrections to the energy intervals and electromagnetic amplitudes. Using the last line of

Table II (with all many-body corrections included) we ﬁnd that the radiative corrections to

the energy intervals change the PNC amplitude by -0.33%. Using the last line of Table III

(with all many-body corrections included) we ﬁnd that the radiative corrections to the E1

amplitudes

6s, 7s

D

change the PNC amplitude by +0.42%.

|

|

Note that in Cs these two corrections nearly cancel each other, the sum of the two

contributions is ∆=(0.42-0.33)%=0.09%. For the ﬁrst time this cancellation was noted in

our work [6] where these corrections in the DHF approximation were estimated to be 0.33%

(E1) and -0.29% (energies). We found that the diﬀerence between our old and new results is

mainly because in [6] we used only 3 dominating terms in the sum (44) while in the present

work we use 8 terms. The fact that in [6] we used a diﬀerent (and less accurate) radiative

potential is not so signiﬁcant. The contribution of the radiative corrections to the omitted

terms n > 9 in the sum (44) in the present work is estimated (using an asymptotic formula)

to be

0.01%.

∼

To estimate the error we also performed another calculation. We neglected the low-

frequency contribution Φl(r) and set the coeﬃcient A(Z, r) = 1 in Φf (r). This variation

changes the s-wave shifts by a few per cent only. However, the p-wave shifts change several

times since they are small and sensitive to the low-frequency contribution Φl(r).

In this

case the E1 contribution is 0.44%, the energy contribution is -0.35%. However, the sum ∆=

0.09% does not change. Thus, the value of ∆ is very stable and practically does not depend

on the choice of the (short-range) radiative potential if this potential gives correct energy

shifts. We estimate the uncertanty in ∆ = 0.09% as

0.01%.

∼

B. Weak matrix elements

The self-energy and vertex QED radiative corrections to the weak matrix elements have

been calculated in Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]) using Coulomb wave functions. However, all

neutral atom wave functions near the nucleus are proportional to the Coulomb wave func-

tions since the screening of the nuclear Coulomb potential and the electron energy may be

23

neglected here. Therefore, the relative magnitude of the QED radiative corrections for an

external electron in a neutral atom is the same for all weak matrix elements

i
1. Moreover, even the many-body correc-

and coincides with the Coulomb case for n, n′

tions do not inﬂuence this statement since these corrections are proportional to the weak

matrix elements

and are multiplied by the same factor (equal to the rel-

h

ˆHW |

n′s

i

ative QED correction for the weak matrix element) which does not depend on n and n′.

This means that we can use the Coulomb results of Refs.

[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] to ﬁnd the

contribution of the QED corrections to the weak matrix elements. The results of calcu-

lations for the self-energy and vertex contribution are the following (in %): -0.73(20) [8]

(all orders in Zα, using approximate relation); -0.6 [9] (lowest order); -0.9(1) [9, 11] (low-

est order and estimate of higher orders); -0.85 [10, 12] (lowest order and higher orders in

the logarithmic approximation); -0.815 [13] (all orders 2s

2p). Note that even for n = 2

the binding energy to mass ratio is En/mc2 = 0.02 and the relative radiative correction

−

should be very close to the large n limit (i.e. one may expect a diﬀerence with the large

n limit result

En/mc2 = 2%). Based on these results we assume the correction equal to

∼

−

±

(

0.82

0.03)% which is in agreement with all calculations.

The Uehling potential contribution is easy to ﬁnd and the error is negligible. According

to Refs.

[4, 5, 6, 7, 11] the Uehling contribution to the weak matrix element is 0.42%

(note that the Uehling contribution to the weak matrix element is practically the same as

its contribution to EP N C since the sum of the Uehling contributions from the energies and

electromagnetic amplitudes is about -0.01%). The Wichmann-Kroll contribution is very

small, -0.005% [6, 14].

Thus, the sum of all radiative corrections to the weak matrix elements contributes

(

Recently, calculations of radiative corrections to the PNC amplitude in Cs were performed

in Ref.

[14] in an eﬀective atomic potential. The result is (

0.27

0.03)%. Our result

−

±

(

0.32

0.03)% is slightly diﬀerent possibly due to the many-body corrections which have not

−
been calculated in the work [14]. Note that the net eﬀect of the many-body corrections in Cs

±

is not very large because of the accidental cancellations of diﬀerent many-body corrections.

One can see these cancellations between the RPAE and correlation contributions in Table III

for the radiative corrections to the E1 amplitudes. A strong accidental cancellation happens

also for the main PNC amplitude where there are 4 large correlation corrections, up to

20%

±

each, and the sum of all correlation corrections is 2% only [6, 33]; such a cancellation does

not take place, for example, in the PNC amplitude for Tl, where the total contribution of

the many-body corrections is large.

The many-body calculations of the PNC amplitude produced by the electron-nucleus

weak interaction are described in detail in our review [1] where one can also ﬁnd numerous

references (see also the original papers for calculations of atomic structure [6, 33, 34, 35] and

Breit corrections [35, 36, 37, 38]). The contribution of the weak electron-electron interaction

is very small. Within the standard model it is equal to 0.04% [5, 39]. Therefore, the PNC

amplitude is proportional to the nuclear weak charge QW . The result, including the radiative

correction (

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

(45)

(46)

(47)

We suggest to calculate radiative corrections to energy levels and electromagnetic ampli-

tudes using the simple radiative potential

Φrad(r) = ΦU (r) + Φg(r) + Φf (r) + Φl(r) +

(48)

2
3

Φsimple

W C (r) ,

25

where ΦU (r) is the Uehling potential (6), Φg(r) is the magnetic formfactor contribution (7),

Φf (r) is the electric formfactor contribution (10), Φl(r) is the low-frequency contribution
(9). The simpliﬁed Wichmann-Kroll potential Φsimple

W C (r) (12) gives a very small contribution

which may be noticeable (

1%) only for Z > 80.

∼

The results obtained using this radiative potential are in good agreement (few percent)

with the radiative corrections to the s, p1/2 and p3/2 energy levels calculated in [22] for the

hydrogen-like ions. The advantage of the radiative potential method is that it is very simple

and can be used in many-electron atoms and molecules.

To calculate radiative corrections to electric dipole amplitudes we suggest use of the

low-energy theorem derived in Section III A. It is applicable because the ionization energy

of an external (valence) electron Eex and the external photon frequency ωex are small in
comparison with the typical frequency of a virtual photon ωv; Eex, ωex ≪
and normalization corrections are expressed in terms of the energy derivative of the electron

ωv. The vertex

self-energy operator. The dominating contribution is given by the corrections to the elec-

tron wave functions produced by the radiative potential. The relative contributions of the

remaining corrections are small,

1/Z 2 in neutral atoms and

(Zi + 1)2/Z 2 in ions.

∼

∼

The radiative potential method allows us to take into account many-body eﬀects. First,

we add Φrad to the Dirac-Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian (i.e., use the potential V = VDHF +Φrad)

and calculate the new self-consistent ﬁeld which includes a correction to the Dirac-Hartree-

Fock potential δVDHF due to the change of the internal electron orbitals produced by Φrad

(the relaxation eﬀect). The relaxation eﬀect is always signiﬁcant. For a short-range potential

Φrad it is larger than the direct radiative shift for electron angular momenta j > 1/2. Then

we can use the new electron energy levels and DHF orbitals to calculate the correlation

corrections applying the many-body theory methods which are described, for example, in

Ref. [6].

We applied the radiative potential method to calculate the radiative corrections to en-

ergy levels and electromagnetic amplitudes in the neutral Cs atom and demonstrated the

importance of many-body eﬀects in such calculations. The many-body eﬀects change the

s-level radiative shifts by

10%, and they change the sign and magnitude of the p-level

∼

shifts. Many-body eﬀects in the radiative corrections to the electromagnetic amplitudes

are also very signiﬁcant. The RPAE (core polarization) corrections usually enhance the

radiative correction. The eﬀect is especially signiﬁcant for the small amplitudes where we

26

observed the RPAE enhancement up to 6 times. The correlation corrections usually act in

the opposite direction and are equally signiﬁcant.

Finally, we calculated the contributions of the radiative energy shifts and radiative cor-

rections for the electromagnetic amplitudes to the PNC 6s

7s amplitude in cesium. The

−

radiative corrections to the weak matrix elements have been calculated in previous works.

The sum of all QED radiative corrections to EP N C is -0.35% (energies) + 0.42% (E1) - 0.41%

(weak) = (

[15] A note on PNC in cesium. The PNC amplitude involves two external ﬁelds acting on the

atomic electrons: the weak ﬁeld arising from Z-boson exchange with the nucleus and an E1

ﬁeld from a laser photon. Of the calculations of strong-ﬁeld radiative corrections to cesium

PNC cited above, only the two works [6, 14] deal with corrections to the PNC amplitude; the

others are calculations of radiative corrections to the weak PNC matrix elements, which are

localized on small distances, their (relative) values therefore being insensitive to many-electron

eﬀects (see Section V B for further discussion).

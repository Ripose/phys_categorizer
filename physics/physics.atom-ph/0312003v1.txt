We consider a system consisting of an atom in the approximation of a harmonic oscillator, coupled
to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Using recently introduced dressed coordinates and dressed states, we
give a non-perturbative solution to the atom radiation process.

Introduction Apart from computer calculations in lattice ﬁeld theory, the currently used method to solve coupled
equations describing the physics of interacting bodies is perturbation theory. This is a common feature to diﬀerent
branches of physical sciences, such as celestial mechanics, ﬁeld theory and statistical physics. The method, originally
introduced to deal with orbital problems in celestial mechanics, has been extremely successful since then, giving re-
markably accurate results in Quantum Electrodynamics and in Weak interactions. In high energy physics, asymptotic
freedom allows to apply Quantum Chromodynamics in its perturbative form and very important results have been
obtained in this way in the last decades.

However, in spite of its wide applicability, there are situations where the use of perturbation theory is not possible,
as in the low energy domain of Quantum Chromodynamics, where conﬁnement of quarks and gluons takes place. In
this particular situation, no analytical approach in the context of Quantum ﬁeld theory is available up to the present
moment. There are other situations in the scope of Electrodynamics, in the domain of Cavity Electrodynamics and
Quantum Optics, where perturbation methods are of little usefulness, for instance, the observation of resonant eﬀects
associated to the coupling of atoms with strong radiofrequency ﬁelds. The theoretical understanding of these eﬀects
on perturbative grounds requires the calculation of very high-order terms in perturbation series, which makes the
standard Feynman diagrams technique practically unreliable [1]. Trials of treating non-perturbativelly such kind of
systems, have lead to the idea of dressed atom, introduced originally in Refs. [2] and [3], which since then has been
used to investigate several situations involving the interaction of atoms and electromagnetic ﬁelds [4], [5], [6].

In this note we give a non-perturbative treatment to the system composed of an atom in the approximation of a
harmonic oscillator interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, using some dressed coordinates itroduced in a previous
paper, which allow to divide the coupled system into two parts, the dressed atom and the dressed ﬁeld. For instance,
to describe the radiation process, having as initial condition that only the mechanical oscillator (the atom) be excited,
the usual procedure is to consider the interaction term in the Hamiltonian written in terms of oscillator coordinates
and the ﬁeld modes as a perturbation, which induces transitions among the eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian. Here
we generalize to the electromagnetic ﬁeld an alternative procedure used in [7,8] for the coupling with a scalar ﬁeld.
We introduce dressed coordinates for, respectively the dressed oscillator and the dressed ﬁeld. In terms of these new
coordinates an exact treatment of the radiation process is possible. We use natural units c = 1, ¯h = 1.

Notice that in the above Hamiltonian the last term proportional to q2. This inﬁnite term guarantes the positivity of
the Hamiltonian. In the case of an oscillator coupled to a massless scalar ﬁeld, considered in Refs. [7–9], this term
is absent at the begining and is introduced afterwards by renormalizing the oscillator frequency. Indeed, also in the

The Hamiltonian given by Eq. (15) is almost identical to the corresponding Hamiltonian in the scalar ﬁeld case
[7,8], with the diﬀerences that the bare oscillator frequency arises naturaly, the coupling involves an angle θk and
the sum is tridimensional rather than unidimensional. The last diﬀerence will involve the need of a regularization
procedure since the last term in Eq. (15) as we will see, is divergent.

which shows that the vacuum state given by Eq. (23) is the ground state of the interacting Hamiltonian given by
Eq. (17). With this formalism we can compute the probability that the oscillator, prepared at t = 0 in their ﬁrst
excited state, remain still at some time t in the same state, or from it the probability of decay of the ﬁrst excited
state. Proceding as in Ref. [7] we obtain for the probability amplitude that the oscillator remain in its ﬁrst excited
state the following expression,

Concluding Remarks In this paper we have analysed a version of an atom-electromagnetic ﬁeld system and we have
tried to give the more exact and rigorous treatment we could to the problem. We have adopted a general physicist’s
point of view, in the sense that we have renounced to approach very closely to the real behaviour of a complicated
non-linear system. As a counterpart, an exact solution has been possible. We have used a formalism (dressed coordi-
nates and dressed states) that allows a non-perturbative approach to the time evolution of the system. In particular,

5

we have applied this formalism to study non perturbatively the time evolution of the excited atom. In the free space
limit of a very large box, we get the result that the dressed coordinate approach describing the atom modiﬁed by
the presence of the ﬁeld in an indissoluble way, gives an exact result for emission in free space, generalizing the well
known exponential decay law.

with eﬀective weak interactions between the electrons and nucleus are also con-
sidered. QED and interelectron interaction corrections to the PNC amplitudes are
derived.

1 Introduction

The spectra of the highly charged ions (HCI) are currently under intensive
experimental investigations [1] - [2]. Due to the strong ﬁeld of the nucleus
acting on the electrons in HCI, the relevant theory should be fully relativistic
and based on the principles of QED. Up to now major experimental and
theoretical eﬀorts were concentrated on the evaluation of the energy level shifts
due to radiative eﬀects (Lamb shift) or to the interelectron interaction, on the
hyperﬁne splitting and on the bound electron g-factor. The recent status of
the problem was described in a series of books and reviews [3], [4], [5], [6].

Transition probabilities were studied less intensively, though a considerable
amount of experimental [7] - [8] and theoretical
[9] - [10] investigations also
exists. The full QED theory for the transition probabilities was considered
in [3], [11] on the basis of the S-matrix approach and in [12] employing the
two-time Green function approach (see also [6]).

In this paper we apply the most general QED line proﬁle approach to the
derivation of expressions for transitions probabilities in HCI with radiative,
interelectron interactions and weak interaction corrections.

The problem of the natural line proﬁle in atomic physics was considered ﬁrst
in terms of quantum mechanics by Weisskopf and Wigner [13]. In terms of
modern QED it was ﬁrst formulated for one-electron atoms by Low [14].
In [14] the appearance of the Lorentz proﬁle in the resonance approxima-
tion within the framework of QED was described and the nonresonant cor-
rections were estimated. Later the line proﬁle QED theory was modiﬁed also
[3]) and applied to the theory of
for few-electron ions
overlapping resonances in two-electron HCI
[17], [18]. Another application
was provided to the theory of nonresonant corrections in HCI and in neutral
hydrogen [19], [20], [21].

[15] (see also [16],

It was found in [22] that the line proﬁle approach provides a convenient tool for
calculating energy corrections. The most natural way to calculate the energy
shift in QED is to calculate the resonance shift in some scattering process.
This way clearly indicates the limits up to which the concept of the energy
of an exited states has a physical meaning – that is the resonance approxi-
mation. The exact theoretical value for the energy of the exited state deﬁned,
for example, by the Green function pole, can be compared directly with the
measurable quantities only in the resonance approximation when the line pro-
ﬁle is described by the two parameters: energy E and width Γ. Beyond this
approximation the evaluation of E and Γ should be replaced by the evaluation
of the line proﬁle for the particular process. For applications of the line proﬁle
approach to the calculation of energy level corrections see [23], [24].

In [15], [16] the line proﬁle theory in QED was developed on the basis of
the evolution operator ˆS(0,
). Such a consideration, though most natural
for describing spontaneous emission and absorption processes, faces serious
diﬃculties due to unrenormalizability of the corresponding S-matrix elements
< f
i >. The resonance approximation itself yields correct results
[15], [16], but the introduction of radiative corrections leads to the appearance
of unrenormalizable expressions.

During the last decades the parity nonconservation (PNC) processes in HCI
became a topic of permanent interest (up to now only from a theoretical point
of view) [25] -

[31], [32].

In neutral atoms, where successful experiments and accurate theoretical calcu-
lations were performed, the main uncertainty is introduced by electron corre-
lation eﬀects arising due to the complicated atomic structure. In few-electron
HCI electron correlation does not play any signiﬁcant role what greatly sim-
pliﬁes the theoretical treatment. The major corrections to PNC matrix el-
ements in HCI are the radiative ones. This allows, in principle, to test the
Standard Model of electroweak interactions beyond the ”tree” level. It is es-
pecially important that the experiments with HCI would provide these tests
in the presence of strong ﬁelds.

Partly the electroweak radiative corrections in HCI were calculated in Ref. [32].
In this work we present the full treatment of the QED part of the electroweak
corrections based on the line proﬁle approach. According to [32] these correc-
tions are dominant in HCI and, unlike the so called ”oblique” corrections, are
strongly ﬁeld-dependent, i.e. diﬀerent in HCI and neutral atoms.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we begin with the description
of the process of resonant photon scattering on the ”tree” level. In section 3
electron self-energy insertions (SE) in the electron propagator within the reso-
nance approximation are considered. It is shown that they improve the energy
denominator of the photon emission (absorption) amplitude. The same is done
for the vacuum polarization (VP) insertions. In section 4 the standard expres-
sions for the Lorentz line proﬁle in the case of the photon emission (absorption)
process is derived; in section 5 it is shown in which way higher-order radiative
corrections to the energy can be incorporated in the Lorentz denominator.
Section 6 is devoted to the derivation of radiative (QED) corrections to the
initial state in the photon emission amplitude.

The derivation of QED corrections to the ﬁnal state requires more reﬁned
considerations, that are contained in Section 7. Here the process of double
resonance photon scattering is introduced. In sections 8, 9 the SE and VP

3

insertions in the diﬀerent electron propagators in the Feynman diagram de-
scribing the double photon scattering are considered. These insertions produce
energy shifts to both resonant energy denominators of the two-photon emis-
sion amplitude. In section 10 the Lorentz proﬁle for the one-photon emission
process in the case of an unstable ﬁnite state is derived from the two-photon
emission amplitude. This derivation includes the integration over the frequency
of one of the photons. The resulting expressions can also be used to include
the Lamb shift of the ﬁnal state in the one-photon Lorentz denominator. The
width of the ﬁnal ground state formally can be set equal to zero; this approach
can be considered as a kind of regularization of the singular amplitudes. Sec-
tion 11 is devoted to the derivation of QED corrections to the photon emission
amplitude (ﬁnal state).

In section 12 the vertex correction to the photon emission amplitude is evalu-
ated; it is shown, that the ultraviolet and infrared divergencies, contained in
the vertex cancel with the corresponding divergencies in the so called ”deriva-
tive” corrections.

QED corrections to the amplitude admixed by the eﬀective PNC weak poten-
tial are investigated in Sections 13-15. It is supposed that the mixed states
with opposite parity are separated only by the Lamb shift and it is shown how
the vanishing denominators in the approximation of noninteracting electrons
acquire a nonvanishing value. The cancellation of the divergencies in the vertex
and derivative graphs with the eﬀective PNC potential is also demonstrated.

In sections 16-19 the results obtained earlier are generalized to few-electron
ions. The ﬁrst-order interelectron interaction is taken into account explicitly.
The introduction of higher-order interelectron interaction corrections is dis-
cussed. First-order interelectron interaction corrections to the PNC amplitude
in the two-electron HCI are derived. Section 20 presents a short summary of
all the results obtained in preceeding sections.

2 Resonant scattering of a photon on an atomic electron

In this section we consider ﬁrst the process of elastic photon scattering on
an atomic electron in lowest-order QED perturbation theory. As usual for
bound-electron QED we employ the Furry picture in which the electrons are
described by the solution of the Dirac equation

(p/

m + γ0eV )Ψ = 0 .

Here p/
(k = 1, 2, 3), p0 = E, where m and e are the electron
mass and charge, respectively, E is the energy, γµ are the Dirac matrices and V

is the potential of the nucleus (point-like or extended). The pseudoeuclidean
metric (+ - - -) in 4-space is used. We employ relativistic units ~ = c = 1
throughout the paper. The Feynman graph corresponding to the process under
consideration is presented in Fig. 1. We will consider the elastic scattering and
will assume that the initial (ﬁnal) state A is the ground state. According to
the standard correspondence rules (see, for example, [3]) the S-matrix element
for the graph Fig. 1 is:

S(2) = e2

where ΨA(x) = ΨA(~x )e−iEAt is the electron wave function, ¯ΨA is the Dirac
conjugated wave function, Aµ1∗
ω (~x) e−iωt is the wave function (elec-
tromagnetic potential) for an absorbed photon with frequency ω. The electron
propagator for bound electrons is taken in the form:

In the resonance approximation the photon frequency ω is close to the energy
EA. Accordingly, we have to retain
diﬀerence of two atomic levels: ω

Eq. (7) shows that in the resonance approximation the scattering amplitude
factorizes into an emission and an absorption part. It follows from Eq. (6) that
the emission amplitude can be expressed as

This implies that the Lorentz proﬁles for emission and for absorption will be
identical as it should be. Eq. (7) also indicates the limit, up to which the
absorption and emission processes are independent - that is the resonance
approximation. Only within the resonance approximation the spontaneous
emission rate is independent from the process how the exited state is prepared.

This approximation is quite adequate in atomic physics. Nonresonant correc-
tions to the transition frequencies are still too small to be observed in present
modern experiments [19] - [21].

3 Radiative insertions in the electron propagator

In this section we consider radiative insertions in the electron propagator.
The electron self-energy insertion is depicted in Fig. 2. The S-matrix element
corresponding to this diagram can be expressed as

Repeating the insertions in the resonance approximation (the next term of
this series is shown in Fig. 3) leads to a geometric progression. Resummation
of this progression yields [14]

Accordingly, in the resonance approximation the emission amplitude is repre-

The operator ˆΣ(EA + ω) may be expanded into a Taylor series around the

where Σ′(EA′)
∂E )E=EA′ . The ﬁrst two terms of the expansion (19)
are ultraviolet divergent and have to be renormalized. The renormalization
of the ﬁrst term to all orders in αZ is well known. A commonly employed
[33] (see further develop-
covariant procedure has been developed by Mohr
ments in [4]). Within this approach the divergencies are canceled analytically.
Originally Mohr’s method was ﬁrst applicable numerically to high and inter-
mediate Z values, but recently the high accurate extension for Z = 1 was
also carried out [34]. Another noncovariant approach is based on the partial
wave expansion of ˆΣ together with a numerical cancellation of divergencies
for each partial wave has been proposed in [35], [36]. This approach is known
as partial wave renormalization (PWR). A variant of the PWR where the di-
vergencies are canceled partly analytically and partly numerically utilizes the
multicommutator expansion method [37], [38].

Apart from self energy (SE) also the vacuum-polarization (VP) insertions
in the electron propagator of Fig. 1 should be considered to all orders in
resonance approximation. The lowest order VP insertion is depicted in Fig. 4a.
For the VP correction the Uehling approximation is frequently applied. In
this approximation the bound-electron propagator in the VP loop (Fig. 4a) is
expanded in powers of the nuclear potential ( in powers of αZ) and only the
ﬁrst term of the expansion is retained (Fig. 4b). The Uehling approximation
leads already to fairly good results even for high Z values [4]. We will adopt this
approximation in our derivations for simplicity. Accordingly, the VP insertions
leads to the following modiﬁcation of Eq. (17):

˜EA′ = EA + ( ˆΣ(EA + ω))A′A′ + (VU )A′A′ ,

(20)

where VU is the Uehling potential [39].

4 Line proﬁle for the emission process

In order to obtain the line proﬁle for the emission process we retain the ﬁrst
term of the Taylor expansion (19) and consider the energy denominator in
Eq. (18) with a shifted energy value

˜EA′ = EA′ + ( ˆΣ(EA′))A′A′ + (VU )A′A′ ,

where

( ˆΣ(EA′))A′A′ = LSE

−

ΓA′ .

LSE
A′ denotes the lowest-order electron self-energy contribution to the Lamb
shift and ΓA′ denotes the lowest order radiative width. The other lowest-order
correction to the Lamb shift is the vacuum polarization

(VU )A′A′ = LVP
A′ .

Since the corresponding energy shift is real the vacuum polarization does not
contribute to the width. To this approximation the emission amplitude reads

Uem =

EA′ + LA′

(U ∗

ω)AA′

where LA′ = LSE
A′ . A method to incorporate the Lamb shift and the ﬁnite
width of the state A in the energy denominator of Eq. (24) will be discussed
below in section 10.

As the next steps of the calculation we have to take the square modulus of
Uem and to integrate over the emission directions ~ν of the photon and to sum

5 Higher-order radiative corrections to the energy

In this section we explain how to incorporate higher-order corrections to the
energy levels in the denominator of Eq. (26). First, we have to take into ac-
count the next term of the Taylor expansion (19). Considering this term as
a correction to the energy denominator, we have to insert the resonance fre-
quency given by Eq. (29). This leads to the ”reducible” part of the second-order
loop-after-loop self-energy (SESE) correction [3], [40].

EA′(SESE, lal, red) = ( ˆΣ(EA′))A′A′( ˆΣ′(EA′))A′A′ .

The irreducible part of the SESE loop-after-loop correction can be obtained

In the sum over n2 6
a complicated higher-order insertion in the electron propagator in Fig. 1. Re-
peating this insertion subsequently in the resonance approximation, we ﬁnally
obtain the additional energy shift of the denominator of the emission ampli-
tude in Eq. (18). This shift represents the irreducible loop-after-loop SESE
correction to the energy of the level A′:

The corrections (31) and (32) represent only two of the second-order radiative
corrections to the energy. The full set of these corrections, i.e. the remaining
second-order self-energy (SESE) corrections, the second-order vacuum polar-
ization (VPVP) and the mixed SEVP corrections can be included in the de-
nominator of Eq. (18) and hence in Eq. (26) in the same way. The expressions
for these corrections can be found in [4] and [40], respectively.

6 Radiative corrections to the emission amplitude (initial state)

SE corrections to the amplitude (initial state), i.e. the SE correction to the
wave function A′ in the expression for the amplitude follows according to the

diagram in Fig. 2 for intermediate states n1 6

to the matrix element (U ∗
ω)AA′ in the emission amplitude. Assuming, that all
the improvements (corrections to the energy of the level A′) in the denominator
are already performed, we now can rewrite formula (18) in the form

In order to obtain the correction to the state A in the matrix element (U ∗
ω)AA′
as well as the correction to the energy EA in the denominator of Eq. (34), we
have to consider the diagrams with radiative insertions in the upper external
electron line. However, these graphs appear to be divergent. The singularity
occurring can not be regularized in a direct manner. To avoid this technical
diﬃculty we may consider the double-photon-resonance scattering process of
an electron in the state A0 with resonance absorption into the state A and
ﬁnally into the state A′. If A is the ground state, A0 is some ﬁctitious state
that plays the role of a regulator. However the ﬁnal expression for the line
proﬁle for the emission transition probability A′
A does not depend on A0
and contains only a dependence on the width ΓA of the state A. This width
can be set equal to zero at the end of the evaluations. Such a regularization
program will be carried out in the following sections.

7 Double resonant photon scattering

According to the idea discussed at the end of the previous section, we now
have to consider the process depicted in the Feynman diagram of Fig. 5. After
the integration over time and frequency variables the scattering amplitude
corresponding to the process depicted in Fig. 5 takes the form

the radiative correction to the emission amplitude that improves the wave
function of the initial state A′.

9 Radiative insertions in the upper electron propagator

In this section we turn to the radiative insertions into the upper electron
propagator of Fig. 5. To give an example the lowest-order SE insertion is
depicted in Fig. 7. Performing again integrations over time and frequency in
the corresponding S-matrix element yields

For simplicity, we may assume that ΓA0A = ΓA and ΓAA′ = ΓA′. This implies
that both states A′ and A have only one decay channel: A′
A0.

This formula does not contain any dependence on the state A0. This state
enters only indirectly through the deﬁnition of ΓA. If A denotes the ground
state, we can set ΓA = 0 in Eq. (60) which yields

The expression above deviates from Eq. (26) only by the presence of the
Lamb shift LA in the denominator. The introduction of the state A0 acts as a
regularization and ΓA plays the role of the regularization parameter. In case
of the ground state A this parameter is removed by setting it equal to zero at
the end of the derivation.

11 Radiative corrections to the emission amplitude (ﬁnal state)

Now we are in the position to determine the ﬁnal-state radiative correction
to the emission amplitude, i.e. to correct the ﬁnal-state wave function. For

15

this purpose we return to Fig. 7 and consider the case: n1 = A, n2 6
= A, n3 =
A′, n4 = A. We assume that the resummation of all radiative insertions in
resonance approximation in Fig. 7 is already performed. Instead of Eq. (51)
we can write

Uem =

( ˜EA(ω0)

(63)

Comparing Eq. (63) with Eqs. (34) and (36) one can see that it represents the
corrections to the ﬁnal-state wave function in the expression for the emission
amplitude.

Collecting now all the various corrections to the amplitudes and to energy
denominators given by Eqs. (36), (63), (20) and (52), respectively, we can
ﬁnally write the generic equation (61) into the form (for the ground state A):

dWAA′ =

1
2π

Γ ˜A ˜A′dω

.

ω)2 + 1

4 Γ2
A′

(˜ωA′A −
For convenience we reintroduced the notation ΓA′ = ΓAA′ and denoted by
Γ ˜A ˜A′ the expression for the width ΓA′ (i.e. for the transition rate A′
A)
where both wave functions of the initial (A′) and ﬁnal (A) states are corrected
according to the formulas (36) and (63). These corrections to the width are
additive, so that

→

(64)

Γ ˜A ˜A′ = ΓAA′ + Γ ˜AA′ + ΓA ˜A′

(65)

where Γ ˜AA′ and ΓA ˜A′ denote the corrections to ΓAA′ which contain the im-
proved amplitudes (63) and (36).

In principle, the width ΓA′ in the denominator of Eq. (64) also should be
replaced by Γ ˜A ˜A′. This means, that a rigorous evaluation of the radiative cor-
rections to the transition probability should include the second-order radia-
tive corrections in the denominator of Eq. (64). The imaginary parts of these
second-order corrections would determine exactly the value of Γ ˜A ˜A′ [3].

12 Vertex correction

A third type of QED corrections to the emission amplitude, which we have to
consider are vertex corrections. For the evaluation of these corrections we can

16

return at ﬁrst to the one-photon resonance picture (Eq. (18)). The SE vertex
correction to the emission amplitude corresponds to the Feynman graph shown
in Fig 8. In the resonance approximation this correction reads

In Feynman gauge the counterterm γµΛ(1) is ultraviolet and infrared divergent.
This divergency cancels, if we take into account another contribution to the
SE vertex that follows from the graph Fig. 2 and which has not yet been
considered. Without changing the results of Section 3 we can take the ﬁrst term
of the geometric progression with SE corrections and multiply the expression
without radiative corrections (i.e., the right-hand side of Eq. (18)) by this
term:

EA into the energy

to the Ward identity

all the divergencies in Eq. (71) cancel. The total renormalized expression
Eq. (71) seems to be asymmetric with respect to A and A′. A symmetric
result can be obtained from the two-photon resonance scattering.

The cancellation of the divergencies with those in U V

Now the expression (65) requires to correct the width by replacing Γ ˜A ˜A′ by
˜Γ ˜A ˜A′ where

˜Γ ˜A ˜A′ = ˜ΓAA′ + Γ ˜AA′ + ΓA ˜A′ .

(80)

The width ˜ΓAA′ results from Eq. (26) by replacing the amplitudes Uem by the
modiﬁed expressions Eq. (71) and (79), respectively.

What further remains is to include the contribution of the VP vertex as de-
picted in Fig. 9. In Uehling approximation the renormalization of the corre-
sponding correction is straightforward. One has to replace the expression for
the electron loop in Fig. 9 b), i.e. the photon self energy Π(x1x2) by the known
renormalized expression ΠR [41].

13 Weak interaction mixed amplitude

To begin the investigation of additional corrections to the amplitude due to
weak interaction we return to the generic one-photon scattering Feynman
diagram Fig. 1 by adding at ﬁrst the eﬀective weak-interaction potential in the
electron propagator (see Fig. 10). We can specify the corresponding scattering
amplitude as

latter is usually determined via a comparison between theoretical predictions
and data from various experiments both in high-energy and atomic physics.
The recent adopted value for the Weinberg angle is Θw = 0.2312 [42].

Within the resonance approximation we set n2 = A′ in Eq. (81). Since the
operator VPNC has no diagonal matrix elements the term n1 = A′ is absent.
However, we can choose a level n1 = A′′ which gives a dominant contribution

2s, A′′ = 2p. Accordingly in the sum over n1 the term yielding the small
EA′ (in the resonance approximation) dominates. The

In particular for states A′ = 2s, A′′ = 2p in the approximation of noninter-
acting electrons EA′′ = EA′. This implies that in the ﬁrst denominator in Eq.
(85) one has to account for the Lamb shift ∆EL. In the next section we will
show how it arises and how to use the form (84) for Uem for this purpose.

14 Radiative corrections to the weak interaction mixed amplitude

The ﬁrst step consist in the evaluation of the SE insertions in the upper elec-
tron propagator in the diagram of Fig. 10 within the resonance approximation
(see Fig. 11 for the ﬁrst term of this sequence).

In resonance approximation we can set EA + ω = EA′ in the matrix element

place Eq. (90) by

A vacuum-polarization correction of this kind has been calculated numerically
in [32].

Now we turn to the evaluation of the SE insertions in the lower electron
propagator in Fig. 10 (see Fig. 12). The corresponding scattering amplitude is

15 Electromagnetic vertex correction to the weak interaction mixed

amplitude

The weak interaction amplitude with one-loop SE corrections at the PNC
vertex is described by the Feynman diagram in Fig. 13. The corresponding
expression for this correction, denoted as U VW

, can be written as

Similarly, the cancellation of the divergency in U VW
em occurs through the deriva-
tive corrections. Consider once more diagrams with SE insertions of the type
as depicted in Fig. 11. Without changing the results of section 14 we can pro-
ceed with the ﬁrst term of the geometric progression in the same manner as
it was done in section 12. This yields

In principle, there exists also the VP electromagnetic vertex correction de-
picted in Fig. 14. However, as it was shown in [32], this correction turns out
to vanish within Uehling approximation.

Finally, we can represent all pure electromagnetic radiative corrections to the
PNC matrix element in the form

(γ0 ˜VPNC)A′′A′ = (γ0VPNC)A′′A′ + (γ0VPNC) ˜A′′A′ + (γ0VPNC)A′′ ˜A′

Apart from corrections to the weak interaction matrix element there exist also
corrections to the emission matrix element in the weak interaction emission
= A′′, but n2 = A′′ in Eq. (92) or
amplitude. They either result by setting n1 6
by inserting radiative corrections into the upper external electron line in the
diagram of Fig. 12. In the latter case one may turn over again to the double
photon resonance picture described in sections 7-11. The other corrections to
the emission matrix element are given by the Feynman graphs in Fig. 15.
These corrections can be treated in the same manner as vertex corrections in
the case of a pure electromagnetic amplitude (section 12).

Note, that there exist unseparable radiative eﬀects which cannot be adjusted
to the weak interaction matrix element or to the emission matrix element in the
weak interaction emission amplitude. These corrections are depicted in Fig. 16.
However, they do not generate small energy denominators of the type (∆EL)−1
and thus are neglible compared to the corrections (107). Nevertheless, they
have to be taken into account if for some reasons the small denominator is
absent.

16 The interelectron interaction insertions in the electron propa-

gators

In this section we begin to investigate the line proﬁles and transition rates in
two-electron ions. The same formalism will be applicable to few-electron ions
as well.

For highly-charged ions the lowest-order radiative corrections and the lowest-
order interelectron interaction corrections (IIC) are approximately of the same
magnitude. While the ﬁrst ones are of the order α = e2 the second ones are of
the order 1/Z which is the same for αZ
1. Since the lowest-order radiative
corrections and IIC are additive the radiative eﬀects can be taken over from

∼

24

case of the one-electron ions (sections 2-12). What remains is to include the
lowest order IIC, i.e. one-photon exchange corrections.

The ﬁrst-, second- and partly the third-order IIC to the energy levels have
been calculated within the framework of QED during the last decade for two-
and three-electron ions [43]- [47], [24]. In particular, the line-proﬁle approach
was used for the evaluation of the reducible parts of the two- and three-photon
exchange corrections in [24], [48], [23].

However, the interelectron interaction corrections to the transition probabili-
ties have not been studied so thoroughly. In this and the following sections of
our paper we present a full QED approach to the evaluation of the IIC based
on the line proﬁle theory. We will mainly concentrate on the ﬁrst-order IIC,
although the generalization to higher orders is straightforward.

Consider the elastic photon scattering on a two-electron ion with the ﬁrst-order
IIC taken into account. We assume that scattering occurs at the electron in
the state A, while the electron in the state B plays the role of a spectator.
This process is depicted in Fig. 17. For the description of the interelectron
interaction we use the Coulomb gauge, distinguishing the exchange by the
Coulomb and Breit (transverse) photons. The contribution of the graph in
Fig. 17 to the scattering amplitude is given by

taining two Coulomb interactions can now be considered as a complicated
insertion into the electron line corresponding to the state A. Repeating these
insertions and summing up the resulting geometric progression we shall obtain
an additional shift in the denominator that will represent exactly the second-
order Coulomb-Coulomb IIC. Similar manipulations can be performed for the
second-order Coulomb-Breit and Breit-Breit IIC. In the two latter cases re-
ducible contributions also arise due the dependence of the IIC corrections on
the photon frequency ω [24], [48], [49].

These reducible contributions, i.e., the so-called reference-state contributions
or derivative contributions can be obtained in the same manner as the re-
ducible contributions discussed in section 5.

The derivation of the IIC correction to the emission amplitude follows to the
derivation of the radiative correction presented in section 6. Assuming now
= A′ but n2 = A′ and that all previous insertions
that in Fig. 17 and Fig. 19 n1 6
are also performed as well, we obtain the generalization of Eq. (120)

To obtain the shift of the energy EA in the denominator of Eq. (121), as well
as the correction to the wave function ΨA in the emission matrix element we
have to turn over again to the double resonance photon scattering picture as
described in section 12. The following section will be devoted to this issue.

17 Double photon scattering on two-electron ions

The double photon resonant scattering process described in section 7 can
be applied without any modiﬁcations to two-electron ions. The ﬁrst-order
IIC insertions into the central electron propagator in Fig. 5 will yield as was
shown in section 8 for the radiative insertions the same result that was already
obtained with the single photon scattering: the shift of the energy EA′

the Lorentz denominator and the correction to the wave function ΨA′ in the
emission matrix element. Instead of repeating this derivation we start with the

27

IIC insertions into the upper electron propagator in Fig. 5. These insertions to
ﬁrst order are shown in Fig. 20. Applying similar steps as described in section
9, we derive an expression for the double photon emission amplitude

For obtaining Eq. (123) we have set n1 = n2 = A, n3 = A′, n4 = A in the
diagrams Fig. 20 a)-d). We can also generalize Eqs. (60), (61) for the Lorentz
line proﬁle both for the excited and for the ground state A. The only diﬀerence
to Eqs. (60), (61) is that now the frequency ˜ωA′A also accounts for the IIC

and the same holds true for ∆EA′B.

Accordingly we can replace ˜ωA′A(B) by its experimental value ωexp
A′A(B). This
is especially important for two-electron ions, where the energy diﬀerences
between the levels within a multiplet can be deduced experimentally more
accurately, than from theory.

Finally, we can write down the correction to the emission matrix element (to
the wave function of the state A), following derivations presented in section
11

n2 6
Again we can write down all the corrections to the transition probability

The ﬁrst-order IIC to the transition probability can be always represented by

To evaluate the IIC corrections to the weak interaction amplitude we can
take the sections 13-14 as a guide-line. The generalization of the diagrams in
Fig. 10 to two-electron ions with IIC insertions into the electron propagators
is depicted in Figs. 21 and 22.

Consider ﬁrst the IIC in Fig. 21. Here we take n3 = EA′ (resonant case) and
n1 = n2 = EA′′ (dominant state). Then the summation of IIC insertions to all
orders will result in (compare with Eq. (88))

For the IIC in Fig. 22 we have to choose the dominant state n1 = A′′ and
the resonant states n1 = n2 = A′. Then the summation of IIC insertions to
all orders yields (assuming again that the summation in Fig. 21 is already
performed)

As in section 14 we employ the resonance condition ω = ˜EA′ + ∆EA′B −

The meaning of ”dominant” state for two-electron ions needs to be clari-
ﬁed. These states should now be speciﬁed in a diﬀerent manner compared to

29

one-electron ions. The most advantageous situation for the observation of the
eﬀects in two-electron ions occurs when two levels belonging to the same multi-
plet but possessing opposite parity appear to be nearly degenerated. Unlike in
the case of one-electron ions in two-electron ions this can happen only acciden-
tally. The standard example is the crossing of the 1s2s1S0 and 1s2p3P0 levels
that occurs for Z = 6 (carbon), Z = 64 (gadolinium) and Z = 92 (uranium)
He-like ions [25]- [29]), [31].

Introducing the frequency

˜ωA′′A′(B) = ˜EA′′ + ∆EA′′B −

˜EA′

∆EA′B

−
we may replace it then by the experimental value ˜ωexp
A′′A′(B). The exact theoreti-
cal value for the splitting ˜ωA′′A′(B) between the nearly degenerated levels of the
two-electron ions can be also used. Now the energy diﬀerence ˜ωA′′A′(B) plays
the role of the small denominator ∆EL and we can write down the analogue
of Eq. (95) in the form

(134)

where ∆EL = ˜ωA′′A′(B) and

Again we do not consider the graphs with VPNC inserted in the outer electron

Finally, we end up with an expression for the PNC matrix element with all
the IIC taken into account

(γ0VPNC)A′′A′ = (γ0VPNC)A′′A′ + (γ0VPNC)A′′ ˜A′ + (γ0VPNC) ˜A′′A′ ,

19 The interelectron interaction corrections in the Dirac-Hartree-

Fock approximation

The QED theory of highly-charged ions, based on the Dirac-Hartree-Fock
(DHF) taken as zero-order approximation has been considered in [3]. Due to
the energy dependence in the Breit-interaction matrix elements (see Eq. (119)),
the Breit-interaction cannot be included exactly in the zero-order DHF scheme.
Therefore, we will consider here the DHF approximation restricting to the
Coulomb interaction only and leaving the Breit interaction to be accounted
perturbatively. Nevertheless, we may emphazise that the DHF method to-
gether with an approximate inclusion of the Breit interaction is widely used
and leads to very accurate results even for high-Z ions (see, for example [11]).

In DHF approximation the one-electron equation (1) should be replaced by

(

p

m + γ0eV + γ0eVHF)Ψ = 0

−

(140)

where the operator VHF is deﬁned as

VHF(~r )f (~r ) =

d 3r′ Ψ+

m(~r ′)VC(~r, ~r ′)Ψm(~r ′)f (~r )

m=1 Z
X

d 3r Ψ+

m(~r ′)VC(~r, ~r ′)f (~r ′)Ψm(~r ) .

(141)

In Eq. (141) Ψm(~r ) are the solutions of the DHF equation with eigenvalues
Em, f (~r ) is an arbitrary 4-component spinor function and the summation is
extended to all occupied states of the N-electron atom or ion.

For highly-charged ions we can consider the term γ0VHF in Eq. (140) as a
perturbation. Then the ﬁrst-order correction to the Coulomb wave function
ΨA (the solution of Eq. (1)) will read

Ψ1

A(~r ) =

(VHF)nA
EA
En −

Xn6=A

Ψn(~r ) .

Using the deﬁnition of the operator VHF, we obtain

Ψ1

A(~r ) =

(VC)nm;AmΨn(~r )
En −

EA

.

m=1 Xn6=A

In case of two-electron ions the sum over m in Eq. (143) reduces to one term
m = B. Then, we obtain the corrections (U ∗
ω) ˜AA′ to the emission
matrix element (Eqs. (122) and (127) only with the Coulomb potential VC) if
we replace the corrected wave functions Ψ ˜A and Ψ ˜A′ by the expression (143).

This means that when evaluating the emission matrix elements with DHF
functions we will automatically take into account the corrections Eq. (122)
and Eq. (127) with the Coulomb operator. The DHF functions include also
higher-order Coulomb corrections which are negligible for high-Z values. The
same holds true for the corrections to the PNC matrix elements as given by
Eqs. (131) and (138), respectively.

20 Conclusions

Summarizing the results obtained in the present paper we can state that a
most general QED approach has been elaborated for the evaluation of various
spectroscopical properties of highly-charged ions: energy level shifts, transition
rates and line proﬁles. The physical process of photon scattering on atomic
electrons provides a proper basis for rigorous QED evaluations of all quantities
being of current interest in studies of highly charged ions.

The resonance approximation has been proven to be a powerful tool for ob-
taining nonperturbative results such as the energy shifts in the Lorentz de-
nominators. This is a most physical way to determine the atomic energy shifts.

Rigorous QED expressions for all generic radiative corrections to the photon
emission process are presented including simultaneously the radiative shift of
the Lorentz denominator. Thus a full QED treatment of the Lorentz proﬁle is
achieved. The weak interaction-induced parity violating amplitudes are also
treated within this approach and a closed expression for radiative corrections
to the PNC matrix element has been derived. This allows for future accurate
calculations of the PNC eﬀect in highly charged ions. Furthermore, the theory
is extended also to few-electron ions.

QED and PNC corrections to the emission amplitude are presented for the
most interesting case of single-excited states in two-electron ions. The renor-
malization procedure for both pure QED radiative corrections and QED cor-
rections in the presence of a parity-violating eﬀective potential is discussed
and the cancellation of the infrared divergencies is veriﬁed.

The general QED approach and the formulas for the various QED corrections
derived in the paper provide a ﬁrm theoretical basis for numerical calculations
in the near future.

Fig. 17. The Feynman graphs that describe the elastic photon scattering on a
two-electron ion in resonance approximation with ﬁrst-order Coulomb interelectron
interaction corrections taken into account. Here A, B denote one-electron states in
the two-electron ion, A′ is the resonant state. The dashed line corresponds to the
Coulomb photon. The graph Fig. 17a) describes the ”direct” term in the amplitude
and the graph Fig. 17b) corresponds to the ”exchange” term. The contributions
of the ”exchange” graphs always enter with an additional minus sign which traces
back to the antisymmetrization of the two-electron wave function.

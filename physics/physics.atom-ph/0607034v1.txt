Based on dressed-state theory, we propose two kinds of wire conﬁguration fabricated on an atom
chip surface. Two dimensional (2D) adiabatic rf trap can be created above the atom chip surface
with a static bias magnetic ﬁeld. Atoms in strong-seeking state can be trapped in the trap by
selecting the positive detuning between frequency of rf magnetic ﬁeld and resonance frequency of
two Zeeman sublevels. We also discuss optimization of loading eﬃciency and trap depth and how
to decide proper construction when design an rf atom chip.

Atom chip [1] is widespread used for manipulating
neutral atoms and becomes a powerful tool for study-
ing the physics of atoms. However, traditional atom
chips use static magnetic ﬁeld for atom trapping. Only
weak-ﬁeld seeking atoms(excited spin state atom) can
be trapped since strong-ﬁeld seeking atoms (ground spin
state atoms) need maxima of magnetic ﬁeld. And this
kind of magnetic ﬁeld is not allowed by Maxwell’s equa-
tion. In this letter for the ﬁrst tome to our knowledge we
propose a rf atom chip for trapping atoms in strong-ﬁeld
seeking state. In comparison to optical trap which is also
able to trap strong-ﬁeld seeking atoms, spontaneous radi-
ation can be ignored in this kind of rf magnetic trap and
energy level is ﬁnite and can be calculated easily [3]. Now
dressed state is introduced for calculating eigenstate and
eigenenergy of atoms. We consider neutral 87Rb atoms
in ground state
which have ﬁve zeeman sublevels
1, 0, 1, 2) and are put into a inhomogeneous
(mF =
rf magnetic ﬁeld Brf . All of ﬁve dressed eigenenergies of
dressed atom Hamiltonian can be obtained as [3]

posal of O. Zobay et al [4] starts from a static Ioﬀe-
Pritchard trap and then superimposes a homogeneous
oscillatory rf ﬁeld where Ω(r) is homogeneous and δ
has inhomogeneous spatial distribution. Our proposal
reverse the idea and starts from a homogenous mag-
netic ﬁeld(bias ﬁeld B0) and superimposes an oscilla-
tory rf ﬁeld which magnitude varies in the space. The
result will go beyond the reversion itself and there will
came some new phenomena. As shown in Equation (1),
for the rf magnetic ﬁeld with a minimum at its cen-
ter (simplest conﬁguration is a quadrupole rf magnetic
ﬁeld), only ǫ1(r) and ǫ2(r) have a minimum at minimum

As showed above, in addition to a homogenous static
magnetic ﬁeld (B0 in Fig. 1), a minimum of rf magnetic
ﬁeld is needed for the rf trap. The simplest conﬁgura-
tion in an atom chip is a wire and a bias rf magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the wire (Fig. 1a). There will be a
zero-ﬁeld point above the wire and a 2D quadrupole ﬁeld
around it in XZ-plane. The distance between wire and
the zero-ﬁeld point depends on the ratio of the current
and the strength of the bias ﬁeld [5]. But the bias rf
magnetic ﬁeld is created by the outer coils which is not
able to carry rf current. The solution is using wires in
atom chip for creating the bias rf magnetic ﬁeld instead
of outer coils, as showed in Fig. 1b and c, both three-wire
and four-wire conﬁguration are able to create requisite
2D rf quadrupole ﬁeld.

Firstly wires are considered as inﬁnitely thin and long,
which is a good approximation when characteristic dis-
tance from the chip surface is bigger than the wire width
and great smaller than the wire length [5]. rf current is
carried by wires where is shown in Fig. 1b and c. In ad-
dition to a DC bias ﬁeld B0, diﬀerent adiabatic rf traps
are created. According to equation (1), in the case of
the trapped state which has strongest interation between
atoms an rf magnetic ﬁeld, the adiabatic rf potential of
three-wire and four-wire conﬁguration respectively,

ﬁeld is
∼
30m which meets the condition. Fig. 2 shows adiabatic rf
potential in XZ-plane. The trap centers of three-wire and
four-wire conﬁguration can be found in (0, l) and (0, √3
2 l)
respectively where both U3
wire are in the
−
minimum point. The trap centers are independent with
current amplitude and detuning δ and merely decided by
the geometry conﬁguration. Around the trap centers the
adiabatic rf potential U3

magnetic potential for cold atoms and BEC. The oscilla-

It is apparent that oscillation frequency of three-wire and
four-wire conﬁguration has a ﬁxed ratio of √3/2 and each
of them has same oscillation frequency along X and Z
axis. We substitute atom mass of Rubidium for m and
will derive a coeﬃcient of 0.67 (as shown in Equation
(3)). When δ becomes very small, the trap approaches
to a 2D quadrupole trap and a huge oscillation frequency
will be extended. But the parameters can not be de-
cided optionally and analysis as follows will disclosure
the problem. After analysis of trap depth and transfer-
ring eﬃciency from
Zeeman state to

all of the trapped dressed states, a contradiction will be
found which will make us select detuning δ carefully.

According to ﬁrst derivative of Equation (2), we can
ﬁnd maximum and minimum point of adiabatic rf poten-
tial and then trap depth is decided easily. It is interesting
that the trap depth has the same form except a coeﬃ-
cient either in three-wire or four-wire conﬁguration or
along X and Z axis. So the trap depth can be written in
one equation which is given by

in order to reduce loss due to atoms overﬂowing from

other situation is added, another limit will appear on
selection of trap parameter which does not exist in tra-
ditional static magnetic trap. According to [3], adiabatic
rf trapped state can be expressed as superposition of all
of the ﬁve Zeeman states. When atoms are entering the
trap, there will be a probability of transferring atoms
from Zeeman state to adiabatic rf trapped state. The
key parameter of transferring probability is δ/Ω(r), big-
ger δ/Ω(r) will increase the transferring probability. This

conclusion can be drawn by either a dressed state the-
ory [3] or a semi-classic theory [8]. The denominator,
Rabi frequency Ω(r), is diﬀerent in diﬀerent spatial lo-
cation because decided by amplitude of rf magnetic ﬁeld
which is a quadrupole form and not homogenous. On
the other hand, the numerator δ is homogenous for a

center and then adiabatic rf potential is created, atoms
near the trap center will derive a high transferring prob-
ability and the farther the atoms is from the trap cen-
ter, the smaller transferring probability is. As shown
in Fig. 4, transferring probability of four-wire conﬁgura-
tion is a little smaller than that of three-wire conﬁgura-
tion, and smaller atom cloud will derive higher transfer-
ring probability. Also bigger detuning δ will cause bigger
transferring probability. But according to Fig. 3 bigger
detuning δ will cause smaller trap depth. There is a con-
tradiction when we select the parameter δ. We can not
get bigger trap depth by increasing current amplitude or
reducing spacing between wires which will increase the
Rabi frequency Ω and reduce the transferring probability,
so the simple idea for keeping trap depth and increasing
transferring probability is reducing the size of atom cloud
which can be realized by pumping to
2
i
Zeeman state after compressed in a static magnetic trap
or compressed by a optical dipole trap directly. For ex-
ample, if the size of atom cloud σx = σz = 10µm and we
want to obtain eighty percent transferring probability,
the detuning δ should be greater than 2π
7.6M Hz and
the trap depth is 117µK (four-wire) and 177µK(three-
wire) along Z axis (trap depth along X axis is much bigger
than it along Z axis). According to Equation (5), tem-
perature of atom cloud should be smaller than 16µK and
coincide with trap center precisely.

sories around the rf atom chip must be considered be-
cause metal will change distribution of rf electromagnetic
ﬁeld for the metal is a kind of good conductor. In order to
create proper distribution of rf magnetic ﬁeld, we should
design the chip conﬁguration carefully. Our atom chip
is made by the technique developed by J. Reichel et al
[1], as shown in Fig. 1(c), the ﬁrst layer is made from
silver and about 200nm in thickness; the second layer is
a kind of epoxy (Epotek 920) for ﬁxing the silver layer
and keeping gold wires on the chip away from the silver
layer. Afterwards gold wires fabricated on an aluminium
nitride chip base. Below the base, there is an oxygen-free
copper mount for ﬁxing the chip and elimination of heat.
The epoxy and base is insulator and not ferromagnetic
material, so they nearly do not eﬀect the distribution
of rf magnetic ﬁeld. Whereas the silver layer and the
copper mount are both metal material, their aﬀect on rf
magnetic ﬁeld should be considered. In our design, wire
width W = 100µm, wire spacing l = 150µm, wire thick-
ness d = 8µm and parameters about rf magnetic ﬁeld,

in thickness is almost transparent for the electromagnetic
wave that we used although silver has very good con-
ductivity. On the other hand, size of the copper mount
is much bigger than the skin depth. After put onto a
copper mount, rf magnetic ﬁeld created by the chip will
change. It is impossible to calculate the distribution of
the rf magnetic ﬁeld by analytic solution. FEM(Finite
Element Method) is used for obtaining numeric solution.

In conclusion We have shown our rf atom chip to be ap-
plicable to realize a trap for atoms in strong-ﬁeld seeking
state. This technique may oﬀer a new way for manipu-
lating atoms on an atom chip and potential application
in realizing atom interferometer and other ﬁelds in inte-
grated atom optics. The 2D character may be used to

realize coherent atom laser. If combined with surface in-
duced evaporative cooling technique [7], an atom laser
with continuous output may be realized.

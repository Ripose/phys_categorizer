Electron impact double ionization of helium from
classical trajectory calculations

Abstract. With a recently proposed quasiclassical ansatz [Geyer and Rost, J.
Phys. B 35 (2002) 1479] it is possible to perform classical trajectory ionization
calculations on many electron targets. The autoionization of the target is
prevented by a Møller type backward–forward propagation scheme and allows
to consider all interactions between all particles without additional stabilization.
The application of the quasiclassical ansatz for helium targets is explained and
total and partially diﬀerential cross sections for electron impact double ionization
are calculated. In the high energy regime the classical description fails to describe
the dominant TS1 process, which leads to big deviations, whereas for low energies
the total cross section is reproduced well. Diﬀerential cross sections calculated at
250 eV await their experimental conﬁrmation.

1. Introduction

Classical trajectory calculations of scattering processes have many advantages: they
are easily implemented and robust and they provide an interpretation in terms of
moving point particles, which is very familiar to our daily life’s experience [1]. But
despite all their “beauty” and simplicity they have two serious drawbacks: they often
are far from accurate and, what is even more limiting, they are conceptually restricted
to one electron atoms — many electron atoms “autoionize”.

In a classical method, which starts from Bohr’s action quantization [2], only the
hydrogen atom is stable. Actually this is the correct behavior: classical mechanics is
the limit of very high quantum numbers. Consequently a classical hydrogen atom
corresponds to a highly excited Rydberg state, which can only decay radiatively.
It is therefore stable in the classical treatment. But a classical two electron atom
resembles a doubly excited helium atom, which is only metastable — the “annoying”
autoionization of a classical many electron atom is the correct physical behavior. To
use such an unstable atom as a target in a classical trajectory calculation despite
this diﬃculty two modiﬁcations of the Hamiltonian have been proposed: either the
electron–electron interaction is neglected in the independent electron model (IEM)

or, as in the “nCTMC” ansatz, additional stabilization potentials are included, which
model the uncertainty relation [3] or place a bound on the accessible binding energies
[4]. But these amendments are quantal additions onto the otherwise purely classical
ansatz.

The stability problem might still be called a technical problem, but the
fundamental diﬃculty remains: Bohr’s action quantization is a one dimensional rule
only. It works for hydrogen, as this problem factorizes in spherical coordinates; each
degree of freedom is quantized on its own. For the helium atom there exists no
coordinate system in which all degrees of freedom separate. This is connected to
the fact that some quantum numbers have to be replaced by “propensity rules” in a
quantal description of the helium atom [5]. In the context of semiclassical calculations
some multi dimensional quantization rules have been proposed, but they are limited
to special geometries [6, 7]. Consequently there exists no prescription that would tell
how to extend Bohr’s hydrogen model into a classical helium atom.

For the hydrogen target, where these two problems do not exist, the cross sections
from a classical trajectory calculation are often not good — and therefore never were
published — especially when angle diﬀerential cross sections are considered. The
obvious way to try to improve the results is to modify the phase space description
of the hydrogen target by including quantum mechanical information. This works to
some extent, but leads either to unstable targets like the Wigner distribution [8, 9]
or to the need for ﬁt parameters [10]. Also with these alternate descriptions the
initial values are not conﬁned to the energy shell any more, an inconsistency that was
neglected when extracting cross sections.

In a recent work we showed on electron impact ionization of atomic hydrogen how
these fundamental problems can be overcome and the cross sections improved by a
rederivation of the classical approximation of the time dependent quantum mechanical
treatment [11]: the scattering process is ﬁrst formulated quantum mechanically in
the Møller picture and then all parts — the initial state, the scattering operator
in its time dependent form and the ﬁnal state — are simultaneously translated into
Wigner’s formulation of quantum mechanics and only then approximated classically by
setting ¯h = 0. The backward–forward structure of the resulting propagation scheme,
a consequence of the Møller form of the scattering operator, refocuses the decaying
classically approximated target onto the collision event. The energy spread of the
initial state is dealt with by switching to cross sections diﬀerential in the energy
transfer instead of using the absolute ﬁnal energies of each trajectory. With this
approach the cross sections on hydrogen could be improved greatly over a wide range
of energies and geometries compared to the standard CTMC procedure. Even fully
diﬀerential cross sections could be reproduced.

This quasiclassical approach now allows for arbitrary target descriptions, which
do not need to be stable and need not be conﬁned to the energy shell. There is also
no fundamental limit on the dimensionality of the initial state, i.e., on the number
of target electrons: the initial distribution to be used in the classical calculation is
derived from the wave function and not from torus quantization according to quantum
numbers, so the way to use multi electron targets in a CTMC like method is open.
In a recent letter [12] we demonstrated that this dynamical stabilization through
the propagation scheme in fact makes it possible to perform ionization calculations on
classical helium targets. We calculated total single and double ionization cross sections
on helium simultaneously without any modiﬁcation of the interactions between all
particles involved.

In this paper we will present further details of the calculation and show and
interpret diﬀerential cross sections for electron impact double ionization of atomic
helium.

2. The quasiclassical procedure

As mentioned above the quasiclassical approach is a classical approximation to
quantum mechanical scattering, in which the quantum formulation is translated into
phase space through the use of a correspondence rule [13, 14] and then approximated
with ¯h = 0. This procedure was presented in detail in [11], so we just give a short
summary and put the emphasis on these parts, which have to be adapted for multi
electron targets.

2.1. Scattering operator and Møller propagation scheme

The backbone of the description is the scattering operator ˆS in the Møller formulation
(see, e.g. [15]):

ˆS = Ω†

−Ω+ with Ω± = lim
t→∓∞

U †(t)U0(t),

(1)

the Møller operators. The propagators U (t) = exp[−iHt] and U0(t) = exp[−iH0t] are
deﬁned in the usual way as the formal solution of the time dependent Schr¨odinger
equation ˙ψ = −iHψ and describe the time evolution of ψ under the full and the
asymptotic Hamiltonian, respectively.

This ansatz partitions the scattering process into three distinct stages, which are
characterized by the considered interactions between the particles. The ﬁrst and the
last asymptotic propagation stages serve to construct the scattering states, which are
solutions of the full Hamiltonian H, from the asymptotic initial and ﬁnal states, which
in turn are eigenfunctions of H i
0 , respectively. For electron impact ionization
of atomic helium the full Hamiltonian has the following form:

H is given in atomic units, which we will use throughout the paper, if not otherwise
denoted. The subscript p denotes the projectile, while the target electrons are labelled
with 1 and 2. Z = 2 is the charge of the target nucleus, which we assume to have an
inﬁnite mass. In the asymptotic initial channel, described by

the projectile electron and the neutral helium target are independent, whereas in the
asymptotic ﬁnal state the ejected electrons do not interact with each other and the
residual ion. We then have to distinguish between single and double ionization and
we consequently have to consider two diﬀerent asymptotic ﬁnal Hamiltonians H f (1)

The electrons are indistinguishable after the scattering event, we therefore label them
with the subscripts a, b and c in the ﬁnal state, where a has the highest and c the
lowest ﬁnal energy.

In the classical limit the Møller procedure translates into a propagation scheme,
where each trajectory is ﬁrst propagated backwards in time with H i
0 and then forward
under H, i.e., with all interactions on. At ﬁrst this may seem like superﬂuous eﬀort,
but this is the crucial diﬀerence to standard CTMC. It allows to use initial state
distributions, which are not stationary under the approximated classical propagation:
in the case of two electrons and a nucleus — the helium atom — one of the electrons
will be ejected already in the initial backward propagation. When the propagation is
reversed this ejected target electron is “brought back” into the atom. So when the
projectile encounters the target both electrons have essentially returned their initial
position. Because of this refocussing by the Møller propagation scheme there is no
more need for any additional stabilization potentials, although all interactions are
included correctly.

In a sense time has been reduced to a mere integration variable, as in the Møller
formulation all the important events — the preparation of the initial state, the actual
scattering process and the extraction of the cross sections — happen at the same
“position” in time t = 0.

A diﬀerent way to view the eﬀect of the backward–forward propagation is the
following: the classical approximation to the correct Wigner propagation neglects
all terms containing ¯h, so errors are introduced. But, neglecting the approaching
projectile for a moment, after going back and forth in time for the same interval the
system returns to the same state again: the combined propagation in both directions
gives the same ﬁnal result as the correct Wigner propagation, only the intermediate
steps, for which t < 0, are diﬀerent. With the projectile added this is not completely
true any more, but most of the error of the classical approximation is cancelled, when
it comes to the target electrons.

2.2. The initial state distribution

In our quasiclassical approximation the initial distribution is constructed from the
quantum mechanical wave function, which describes the initial state according to the
asymptotic initial H i
0. With our choice (3) this is a product wave of the free projectile
electron and the helium target in its ground state. These two independent wave
functions are translated into the Wigner picture [16] and then the product of their
classical ¯h = 0 approximations is discretized, each discretization point serving as initial
conditions for a trajectory in the above explained backward–forward propagation
scheme.

Due to the ¯h = 0 approximation each of these trajectories evolves independently,
but that does not imply that they are to be interpreted independently of each other.
As the initial state is modelled by all initial values collectively, also their entirety only
describes the scattering process. Remeber that we still deal with a description in wave
functions, though obscured by the classical approximation and the discretization.

For helium and more complex atoms there arises an additional diﬃculty compared
to hydrogen: there the exact analytic wave function is known, whereas for helium only
approximate wave functions of varying complexity have been formulated [17, 18, 19,
20, 21]. We therefore have to choose not only a prescription for how to translate
the quantum wave function into a classical distribution [11, 13, 14, 16] but also an

5

(6)

appropriate wave function to start from.

For this ﬁrst analysis we started from the most simple quantum mechanical
ansatz for the helium wave function. We use the “1s2” product state of two identical
hydrogenic ground state wave functions with an eﬀective nuclear charge C. This
product wave ψ(r1, r2) = H1sC (r1) H1sC (r2) is then translated into a product of two
identical classical phase space distributions.

ψ(r1, r2) =

exp(−Cr1) exp(−Cr2)

C3
π

Independent of the nuclear charge this product wave function yields the minimum
energy at C = Z − 5/16 [18], i.e., C = 27/16 for helium. This results in an energy of
Et = −2.85 a.u. (−77.5 eV), slightly less than the experimental value of −2.904 a.u.
(−79 eV).

The angular electron–electron correlation is neglected in the initial wave function
(6). Nevertheless we include the mutual repulsion of the target electrons in H i
0, so
their motion is coupled from the very moment the propagation is started. Of course,
exchange correlation eﬀects are beyond the reach of a classical approximation.

As shown by Cohen [14] a generalization of Weyl’s correspondence rule allows
to derive nearly arbitrary recipes to set up the initial distribution within this
quasiclassical ansatz. Each of them has diﬀerent properties, which are important
in diﬀerent energy regimes, as was shown in [11]. We use three of the prescriptions
described there, to convert the one electron wave functions H1sC of equation (6) into
phase space distributions: (i) the “product” distribution [14], where the single electron
wave function is translated into the product of the coordinate and momentum space
densities, (ii) the “microcanonical” distribution [2], where each of the electrons is
sampled according to a microcanonical distribution at an adapted one electron energy
of −1.94 a.u., so that the (averaged) total energy, including the electron’s interaction,
resembles that of the helium ground state and (iii) “Cohen’s energy distribution” [4],
which is a superposition of microcanonical distributions with an energy dependent
weight function, rescaled for the eﬀective C.
To avoid clumsy wording we will

label these distributions in the following
as “product distribution”, “microcanonical distribution” and “Cohen’s (energy)
distribution”, respectively, though these names are originally associated with the
underlying one electron distributions.

In the calculations on hydrogen [11] the product distribution performed best for
high energies, whereas Cohen’s energy distribution gave the best results at very low
total energies. These two reproduce the density of the hydrogen ground state both
in coordinate and momentum space. The microcanonical distribution, which is the
only purely classically derivable distribution, has, due to its ﬁxed binding energy, the
wrong spatial density and gave worse results for all energies considered than any of
the other distributions.

In addition to the density in phase space the energy spread
t i − hEti2 of the distributions turned out to be an important criterion, too.
All three distributions have the same total energy of −2.85 a.u. = −77.5 eV, but
p
their energy spread is quite diﬀerent, see ﬁgure 1: the product distribution includes a
t = 5.71 a.u. = 155 eV, which is
rather wide range of energies with a spread of
twice the total energy of the target. Next comes Cohen’s energy distribution, which

consequently the smallest value of only 1.18 a.u. = 32 eV.

In the next section we will conﬁrm that the actual value of the total energy of
the initial distribution is of secondary interest only, because the correct ionization
potential is used to extract the cross sections, not the (wrong) binding energy of the
initial state.

2.3. The cross section

In the quantum mechanical formulation the fully diﬀerential cross section is calculated
from the squared overlap between the scattered wave function |ψsi = ˆS|ψii and
the given ﬁnal state |φf i. This overlap scalar product then translates into a phase
space integral of the scattered distribution ρs times the classical approximation of the
projector onto the ﬁnal state Pf .

|hφf |ψsi|2 ⇒

dr dp Pf ρs

Z

(7)

According to the ﬁnal state Hamiltonians for single and double ionization, equations
(4) and (5), the free electron wave functions are plane waves. The corresponding
projector consequently is a product of momentum delta functions, which are then
reformulated in ﬁnal angles and energies.

We include the symmetrization of the electrons into the ﬁnal state, which means
that in the classical approximation we have to consider all permutations of the
electrons in Pf when calculating the overlap scalar product.

We see that the cross section is determined at ﬁrst by the (discretized) scalar
product between wave functions, translated into phase space, and only secondly by
the acceptance region of a macroscopic classical detector. This is not a technical
diﬀerence to the classically derived standard CTMC, but one of interpretation: in this
quasiclassical context one should refrain from “interpreting” single trajectories as the
paths of real electrons, they are only time dependent discretization points in phase
space.

From equation (7) we easily see how to deal with excitation cross sections in this
quasiclassical approach: the ﬁnal state projector Pf then explicitly includes the ﬁnal

r
Classical electron impact double ionization of helium

bound state of the excited target electron according to the translation rule chosen for
the initial state (cf. section 2.2). To calculate the excitation cross section the ﬁnal
values of all trajectories are summed up with a weight according to the ﬁnal excited
state’s phase space density. Special care has to be taken to ensure that the phase space
densities chosen to represent the bound orbitals are orthogonal in order to conserve
probability.

An ansatz to use ﬁnal state densities modelled after the quantum wave functions
along the lines of Eichenauer et al
[8] and Hardie and Olson [10] was recently
introduced by Sattin [22]. There microcanonical distributions are added up according
to a weight function depending on the orbits’ energy.

The classically derived prescriptions for bining the trajectories’ ﬁnal values, on

the contrary, are based on action angle quantization [23, 24].

The ﬁnal state now has a ﬁxed total energy, but our initial state, and consequently
the scattered distribution ρs, too, is not conﬁned to the energy shell. The overlap
with the on-shell ﬁnal state would consequently cut out of the whole ρs only those
trajectories, which initially had started on the energy shell, i.e., only a part of the
initial distribution would actually be used. This is both a conceptually unsatisfying
situation and a problem of normalization.

To solve this issue we switch to cross sections diﬀerential in energy transfer, as
explained for the hydrogen target in reference [11]. The energy diﬀerence ∆Ep for the
projectile electron is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the ﬁnal and the initial energy,

∆Ep = Ef

with Ef
2 . For the electrons of the helium target the electron–
electron repulsion in the initial state has to be accounted for, too, as it is released
in the ionization process. For the initially bound electrons the energy transfer is
consequently deﬁned as, here written without the subscripts 1 or 2:

All ﬁnal states, which contribute to double ionization, are characterized by three

free electrons, i.e.,

− ∆Ep > IP1 + IP2

and ∆E1, ∆E2 >

IP1 + IP2
2

.

IP1 = 24.6 eV and IP2 = 54.4 eV are the (positive) ionization potentials for the ﬁrst
and the second electron, respectively: the projectile has to supply enough energy to
ionize both electrons.

For single ionization two of the three electrons are free and the third is still bound,
i.e., we get the following conditions for the energy transfers, which have to be tested
with electrons 1 and 2 exchanged, too:

− ∆Ep > IP1, ∆E1 >

and ∆E2 <

IP1 + IP2
2

IP1 + IP2
2

(11)

These requirements may seem asymmetric at ﬁrst sight, but when one electron is
ionized, the interaction energy between the target electrons, which is the diﬀerence
between IP1 and IP2, is released, too, making up for the diﬀerence between ∆Ep and
∆E1 + ∆E2 (see equation (9)).

Apart from this selection through the ﬁnal state another constraint has to be
considered, which originates in the Møller propagation scheme: the central forward

propagation can only be reversed into the ﬁnal backward leg, if those interactions,
which have to be switched oﬀ from H to H f (1)
, respectively, have vanished
suﬃciently. To turn oﬀ the nucleus–electron interaction an electron has to be far away
from the nucleus, but it can only get away if it is not bound, i.e., if its actual energy
is positive:

(12)

For the total cross section for single or double ionization therefore the summation
over contributing ﬁnal states (7) satisfying the constraint from the Møller scheme (12)
amounts to counting those trajectories, for which both the energy transfers, equations
(11) and (10), are correct and the actual energies (12) of two or three electrons are
positive, respectively. With these sums, N (1) and N (2), the absolute cross sections are
calculated in the usual CTMC way from the maximum impact parameter B0 and the
total number N of propagated trajectories:

The single ionization cross section also includes events, in which the remaining electron
is excited.

The recipe for how to extract cross sections is transferred into the classical form
independently of the initial state description. This is the reason why we do not refer
to the smeared binding energy Et of the initial distribution, but to the experimentally
observed correct ionization potentials IP1 and IP2. Any initial state can be used,
independent of its energy; one might even fancy two electrons without a nucleus
localized in space according to the quantum densities — a setup with a positive total
energy. But an electron would be considered ionized only when enough additional
energy has been transferred onto it.

3. Results

Up to now we have repeated and detailed how the quasiclassical procedure has to be
set up to calculate electron impact ionization on atomic helium. That the propagation
scheme actually refocuses the autoionizing helium target has been shown in a recent
letter [12]. We now present and discuss the total cross sections for single and double
ionization and then conﬁrm our ﬁndings through diﬀerential cross sections.

3.1. Total cross sections

With the three initial distributions explained above the total ionization cross sections
σ(1) for single ionization and σ(2) for double ionization are calculated. The results are
compared to measurements by Shah et al [25] in ﬁgure 2. The diﬀerences between the
initial distributions are only small both for σ(1) and σ(2): all three distributions lead to
the same shape of the cross sections while the absolute value diﬀers in a range of about
±15%. Therefore ﬁgure 2 only shows the results from the product distribution. The
result from the microcanonical distribution is slightly higher, while Cohen’s energy
distribution leads to a slightly smaller total cross section. A similar behavior had
occurred already for the total cross sections on hydrogen, calculated in [11].

The single ionization cross section σ(1) agrees with the measurement on the level
expected from a classical trajectory calculation: the overall coincidence is reasonable,

but the absolute value at the maximum is slightly too high, the maximum itself is
shifted to lower energies by a factor of about two and the high energy behavior follows
the classical 1/E decay [26] instead of the correct Bethe–Born limit of ln(E)/E [27].
This cross section had been calculated previously by Schultz etal, both in the
independent electron model and with the nCTMC procedure [28]. Our calculation
with the microcanonical distribution reproduces the nCTMC result, which is closer to
the experiment than the IEM model. This is not surprising, as the nCTMC initial state
can be viewed as a symmetric subset of our microcanonical description. The additional
stabilization potential used there prevents autoionization before the scattering event
and then essentially vanishes, once one of the target electrons is ionized.

Before we actually look at our results for the double ionization cross section σ(2),
we want to contemplate, which high energy behavior can be expected from a classical
description: again, as with σ(1), quantum eﬀects like tunneling are not accounted for in
the classical treatment. Additionally the so called shake–oﬀ process, which is dominant
for double ionization at very high energies [29], can not be modelled classically: When
in the classical description one of the electrons is removed then there is no quantization
condition as in quantum mechanics, which “forces” this electron to change its orbit
to one of the allowed ones — either to one of the discrete bound levels or to the
continuum. Classically any orbit at any binding energy is allowed, so there is no need
for a transition; and consequently no shake–oﬀ process. In the classical treatment even
an opposite eﬀect occurs: when one of the target electrons is removed, the remaining
ion is actually “stabilized” in its current (excited) state, because with the other target
electron the cause for autoionization is removed.

Though the shake–oﬀ process does not exist in the classical description, there are
still two important processes left, which lead to double ionization:
in the so called
“Two–Step 1” (TS1) process the projectile ionizes one of the target electrons, which
in turn ionizes the other one in a subsequent (e, 2e) reaction. The probability for the
second ionization only depends on the energy spectrum of the ﬁrst electron and is
In the classical description
therefore nearly independent of the projectile energy.

Figure 3. Bethe like plot of the double ionization cross section σ(2): comparison
of our quasiclassical calculation with the product distribution (solid line) to the
experimental results of Shah et al [25] (circles) and of Rejoub et al [31] (triangles).
For better comparison with ﬁgure 2 the impact energy is not scaled with the
ionization threshold.

the TS1 process consequently should decrease roughly proportional to the single
ionization’s 1/E law. The other process, the “Two–Step 2” (TS2) process, consists
of two independent encounters between the projectile and the two target electrons.
Each collision’s probability falls oﬀ as 1/E, so the TS2 decays proportional to 1/E2.
Therefore it can be deducted from the high energy behavior of σ(2), if the TS1 or the
TS2 process is dominant in the classical description.

Looking at the results for the double ionization cross section σ(2) in ﬁgure 2 we
see that for high energies it decreases much faster than σ(1) — in fact it follows a
1/E2 behavior for E > 600 eV — while the experimental results conﬁrm the constant
asymptotic ratio of σ(2)/σ(1) derived from quantal calculations [29].

We therefore may conclude, that in classical trajectory calculations the double
ionization at very high energies mainly happens through the “Two–Step 2” (TS2)
mechanism, whereas the TS1 seems to be missing. To verify this hypothesis, which
contradicts the experimental evidence [30], we have to look at diﬀerential cross
sections.

For energies below the maximum of the cross section, on the other hand, the

experimental results of σ(2) are much better reproduced than for σ(1).

The correspondence between the quasiclassical results and the experimental data
at low energies can be seen more pronounced, if a Bethe plot like presentation is chosen:
ﬁgure 3 plots the product of the total energy and σ(2) against the impact energy, our
results with the product distribution as well as experimental data from Shah et al

[31]. The cross section is in nearly perfect agreement with
the measurements from low impact energies up to about 250 eV. For impact energies
above 250 eV our calculation falls back against the experimental results. Against
common experience and the usual interpretation of the correspondence principle high
energies in electron impact ionization obviously do not mean that the system becomes
more “classical” — on the contrary, the description becomes worse and worse, the
higher the energies become. Further classical calculations should therefore focus on

s

the low energy regime, where the correlated dynamics of all four particles becomes
more and more complex and even chaotic. Therefore it is not possible to make a
simple prediction about the ionization mechanism at intermediate and low energies.
It is only right above the threshold where a highly symmetric ﬁnal state conﬁguration
and a power law behavior is predicted by a Wannier type argument [32, 33].

With these arguments it is understandable that in the classical calculation σ(2)
is reproduced much better at low energies than σ(1): due to the higher dimensionality
of the phase space there exist more classical reaction paths for double than for single
ionization, which renders quantum eﬀects less important than when only one electron
is removed.

If we attribute the diﬀerence between our results and the experiment to the
missing TS1 process, as explained above, then we can estimate that the probability for
the sequential TS1 is negligible below about 250 eV. For a TS1 event to be possible
at 250 eV the projectile has to transfer about one third of its energy onto one of
the target electrons, which is already a rather “violent” collision. For higher impact
energies the TS1 process then becomes increasingly important and we can estimate
from the diﬀerence between our calculated σ(2) and the experiment that at Ei ≈ 500
eV both processes contribute with equal weight to double ionization. With fully
diﬀerential cross sections a “great importance of second– or higher–order eﬀects” at
600 eV has been observed by Lahmam–Bennani et al [34].

For double ionization there is, for obvious reasons, no CTMC comparison available
yet. Our result is the ﬁrst classical trajectory calculation for double ionization with
two active target electrons without additional stabilization potentials or the need to
“switch oﬀ” the interaction between the target electrons.

It should be emphasized, that the absolute cross sections for both single and
double ionization can be calculated from the same run of the program. For both cases
the same initial distribution is used and both target electrons are explicitly included.
In principle excitation could be included in the analysis, too, though here we conﬁne
ourselves to ionization alone. This is parallel to the experiment, where single and
double ionization and excitation all occur concurrently.

It was not clear a priori, though, if this would really work. For single ionization,
e.g., the second electron, which is not ionized, might not act as an independent
spectator and could disturb the single ionization process.

In an IEM treatment it is for methodological reasons not possible to calculate
all processes simultaneously: there the electron–electron repulsion in the target is
neglected and therefore only one of the two thresholds for single or for double
ionization can be described correctly. The same diﬃculty arises in the nCTMC
treatment due to the restricted symmetric geometry of the initial distribution.

In an actual calculation it is more eﬃcient, though, to run the calculation twice
with two diﬀerent maximal impact parameters: a bigger one for σ(1) to cover the
whole target area and a smaller one to achieve enough statistics for the much rarer
double ionization, where both target electrons have to be located around the path of
the projectile. Typical maximal impact parameters are B0 ≈ 30 a.u. for single and
B0 ≤ 3 a.u. for double ionization. Then at each impact energy about 105 trajectories
are necessary for suﬃciently small statistical errors of the total cross section.

The propagation of the electrons’ trajectories is performed by a symplectic
integrator, which separates the attractive regularized electron–nucleus interaction
from the electrons’ mutual repulsion (for details please see reference [11]). This
algorithm is extremely stable, as it even allows the electrons to fall “into” the nucleus.

To calculate diﬀerential cross sections huge numbers of trajectories have to be run and
the number of faulty trajectories has to be much smaller than the few trajectories that
contribute to a given cross section. Typical fractions of trajectories which had to be
discarded are on the order of one per every ten million trajectories, which is smaller
than the yield of double ionization events by at least three orders of magnitude.

3.2. Diﬀerential cross sections at high energies: Ei = 2 keV

The total double ionization cross section at high energies falls oﬀ as 1/E2, which is
much faster than the experimental data. This had lead us to conclude that in this
regime double ionization essentially occurs through independent collisions between
the projectile and each of the two target electrons. But now we need to verify
this conjecture, because the diﬀerence between our calculation and the experiment
might also be caused by the classical approximation itself, i.e., that the occurring
processes are modelled correctly, but only the overall probability is too small due to
the description of the electrons as classical point particles.

We therefore ran calculations at an impact energy of 2 keV, which is well into the
high energy regime. At this energy single and double diﬀerential cross sections were
measured by Dorn et al [35]. The numbers of trajectories calculated with the three
initial state descriptions and the resulting double ionization events are given in table
1. To increase the number of double ionization events the impact parameter of the
projectile was sampled linearly between 0 and B0; in the analysis each trajectory then
b
2B0 . Therefore the total double ionization
is weighted with an additional factor of
cross section can not be calculated from the values given in table 1 alone but only
from the saved trajectory data.

The two “classical” ionization processes, the TS1 and the TS2, lead to diﬀerent
signatures in the angular and energetic distribution of the ejected electrons. They are
already discernible in partially diﬀerential cross sections: at this high impact energy
the energy loss of the projectile is much smaller than its initial energy, the ﬁnal
channel therefore consists of one fast and two slow electrons. These two slow electrons
repel each other on their way out; ejection into the same half sphere is consequently
suppressed. Due to the two independent collisions this is the main angular signature of
the TS2 process. In the TS1 process, on the other hand, the momenta of the two slow
electrons are correlated because of the second (e, 2e) process. This elastic collision
between two particles of identical mass leads to a peak in the relative angle between
the slow electrons in the range between about 90 and 110 degrees, depending on the
relative energy partitioning and the momentum transferred.

This angle between the two slow electrons is plotted in ﬁgure 4 for an impact
energy of 2 keV: our results are compared to polynomial ﬁts of the measurements of
Dorn et al [35]. The relative angle is integrated over all pairs of slow electrons, which

have a sum energy of Eb + Ec < 35 eV in the calculation and Eb + Ec < 20 eV in the
experiment. The experimental data are given for two diﬀerent kinematical regimes,
discerned by the momentum transfer of the projectile q and the recoil ion’s momentum.
Both the experimental curves show a distinct peak, whose position varies with the
momentum transfer. Our results, on the other hand, show a broad distribution
of angles, whose only feature is the suppression of small relative angles due to the
electrons’ mutual repulsion. The form of the angular distribution is independent of
both the momentum transfer and the maximum sum energy, only the number of
contributing events varies. The angular distribution is essentially independent of the
relative energy partitioning ǫ = Eb

, too.

This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that at high energies in the
classical descriptions the TS2 process is dominant, contrary to the experimental
evidence.

Eb+Ec

The two considered processes, the TS1 and the TS2, can be discerned, too, by
comparing the joint distribution of the slow electrons’ ﬁnal energies: at these high
impact energies the energy transfer is much smaller than Ei, so that on the average
in the two collisions of the TS2 twice as much energy is transferred onto the target
electrons than in the one collision of the TS1. In the TS1 this energy is then shared
between the two target electrons. The energy distribution of electrons ionized in a
TS2 process should therefore be about twice as wide as the one of electrons from the
TS1 process.

The distribution of energies of the two slow electrons is plotted in ﬁgure 5. Panel
(a) shows the experimental data of Dorn et al [36], whereas our quasiclassical result
with Cohen’s initial distribution is shown in (b). At ﬁrst glance both results seem to
be similar, but it is important to note that in (b) the scale of the energy axes is twice
as wide as in (a).

The dip in the experimental cross section where both energies are small is due to
the time resolution of the spectrometer: events, in which the longitudinal momentum

be resolved in this experiment. When both energies are small, then the relative
momentum is also small. This restriction is included in our result, too.

Figure 6 shows the same cross section calculated with the microcanonical
distribution (a) and with the product initial state description (b). The eﬀect of
the diﬀerent initial state descriptions can clearly be seen: with the microcanonical
distribution the very asymmetric events are missing, i.e., when one of the ejected
electrons only has a small energy. The explanation is connected to the form of the
energy spread of the initial distribution, see ﬁgure 1: both electrons are sampled
independently at the same ﬁxed one–electron energy. Consequently the spread of the
total energy is determined solely by their interaction — but as their distance is limited

Classical electron impact double ionization of helium

15

there is a lower limit for this contribution, and therefore for the total energy of the
target initial conditions. There is no upper limit for the electron–electron repulsion,
therefore, to achieve the correct average binding energy, most of the initial values must
have a binding energy of less than the average to compensate for the relatively few
events, where the interaction energy is high. These initial conditions with energies
below the average are harder to ionize within our scheme, which requires the electrons
to be actually free in the end. As the ﬁnal energies increase this threshold blocks
less and less events that have the correct energy transfer and then the cross sections
resemble that from Cohen’s distribution (ﬁgure 5(b)).

This again shows that an initial distribution which is constructed from a classical
recipe may have unphysical properties — here the hard limits in the radial and the
energy distributions — and lead to problems, when used in a quantum mechanically
derived context.

With the product distribution, ﬁgure 6, the energies of the two slow electrons
are spread out to even higher values compared to Cohen’s distribution. This is the
consequence of the very broad energy spread of the initial state, which is about twice
as wide as the distribution of ﬁnal energies resulting from the ionization process. But
it is not our method which breaks down. The energy of each trajectory is still well
deﬁned. This very wide initial energy spread means that there are many “extreme”
initial values, i.e., trajectories, in which the electrons are started with high momenta
at large distances from the nucleus, with low momenta at small distances or with a
very small interelectronic distance. Trajectories started there are far more likely to
end “outside” the main features of the cross section and therefor blur the result.

Summarizing, one can say that the evidence presented — the high energy
behavior of σ(2), the distribution of the inter–electron angle and the energies of
the slow electrons — conﬁrms that at high energies a (quasi) classical treatment of
double ionization can not describe the important processes. In general the coupling
between the target electrons is grossly underrepresented. The reason for this behavior
originates in the description of the electrons as point particles: when the ﬁrst electron
is not kicked exactly into the direction of the other target electron, the second stage
of the TS1 process can not take place. Obviously, in most cases the ﬁrst electron is
ejected so that the other electron does not “notice” it. Or in other words: for the ﬁrst
electron to ionize the other, it has to be kicked into a very narrow cone around the
vector connecting the two electrons’ positions. In the quantum mechanical treatment
both electrons are located spherically symmetric around the nucleus; the ﬁrst ionized
electron always has to pass “through” the other electron. Therefore the subsequent
ionization can take place independent of the direction in which the ﬁrst electron leaves
the atom.

This shortcoming of the classical approximation is independent of the initial
state’s description, though the results show that it is nevertheless important to choose
the best possible distribution: an inappropriate initial distribution can only make the
results worse.

It is interesting to note that recently photo double ionization has been described
amazingly well in a mixed quantum classical picture [37]. In the classical part, which
models the sequential “TS1” process the electron that absorbs the photon starts “on”
the nucleus. From this highly symmetric starting point it always has to pass through
the probability distribution of the other electron and the chance for their encounter
is independent of the initial direction of the ﬁrst electron.

3.3. Diﬀerential cross sections at Ei = 250 eV

For low impact energies up to about 250–300 eV the agreement between the measured
and the calculated total double ionization cross section is remarkably good, see ﬁgure
3, suggesting that in this energy regime the quasi classical treatment should be able
to describe those dynamics, which are actually taking place. Unfortunately there are
no measurements of electron impact ionization of helium available yet in this energy
regime, though ﬁrst results of kinematically complete experiments at 500 eV are just
being reported [38] and results from even lower impact energies will surely follow.
We decided not to perform calculations at Ein = 500 eV at this point, because of
what we learned above from the results at Ein = 2 keV we expect them to be at
most partly correct. So we can not compare our results to an experiment yet, but
it will nevertheless be instructive to look at the available quasiclassical results and
predictions.

The numbers of trajectories calculated and the resulting double ionization events
for the three initial distributions are summarized in table 2. The impact parameter
was sampled linearly again as for 2 keV.

The diﬀerent spatial form of the microcanonical distribution, which was explained
in section 2.2, is reﬂected in these number, too: to achieve a comparable number of
double ionization events N2 with the product distribution about four times as many
trajectories had to be run. The resulting total σ(2) is nearly the same, though. This
means that with the microcanonical distribution double ionization on average takes
place at an impact parameter, which is about four times larger — the target electrons
are found at larger radii.

Now, at Ein = 250 eV, the projectile electron is only about twice as fast as the
classical target electrons; the dynamics is much slower than at 2 keV and it can be
expected that the distinction between the fast projectile and the slow ionized target
electrons vanishes.

This eﬀect can already be seen when the angle diﬀerential cross sections dσ
dθ of
the fastest ﬁnal electron and of the former projectile after a double ionization event
are compared, see ﬁgure 7. At Ein = 2 keV the two cross sections are indiscernible
(not shown here), but now they diﬀer by about 10 % in the forward direction and
even more for angles larger than 60◦. The projectile is still emitted preferentially
into the forward direction, but in one of about every ten double ionization events it
transfers so much of its energy onto the target electrons that one of these becomes the
fastest. These fast ionized target electrons then show up in ﬁgure 7 in the direction
perpendicular to the incident projectile, i.e, at angles between 60◦ and 120◦. When
the projectile is scattered backwards, i.e., θ > 135◦, it had to reverse its momentum.
This big energy transfer makes that in the backward direction the projectile is rarely
the fastest electron.

In an experiment the distinction between the former projectile and the target

said before, the crossover between the two angular patterns takes place around 50 eV.
Both ﬁgure 8 and 9 are not very sensitive to which initial distribution has been
used; the diﬀerences are the same as those already observed at the slow electrons’
joint energy distributions, see ﬁgures 5(b) and 6: with the microcanonical distribution
the events with very small ﬁnal energies are missing again and with the product
distribution both the distribution of the angles and the energies is broadened.

The cross sections at Ein = 250 eV shown until now were extracted from the
double ionization events, but they did not test for any correlation between the outgoing

J
Classical electron impact double ionization of helium

electrons.

At 2 keV the projectile is much faster than the ionized target electrons; the
correlation between the electrons aﬀects mainly the “subsystem” of the two slow
electrons. The presence of the fast projectile can conveniently be reduced to a
momentum and energy transfer onto the otherwise independent target system. But
now, at Ein = 250 eV, where the dynamics is much slower and the three ﬁnal energies
are closer together this separation is at best questionable. We therefore need a way to
plot the ﬁnal energies and angles, which is sensitive to correlations between the three
particles.

Ei
Ea+Eb+Ec

One possibility is the so called Dalitz plot [39]:

it places the relative ﬁnal
energies ǫi =
, with i = a, b, c, of the three electrons inside an equilateral
triangle, cf. ﬁgure 10. As ǫa + ǫb + ǫc = 1 each combination of ﬁnal energies is
mapped unambiguously onto one point inside the triangle, for which the distances
from the three sides have the same ratios with each other as the relative energies.
This representation of the energies of three correlated particles was ﬁrst used in high
energy physics, but has recently been adapted in atomic physics, too, e.g., for the
fragmentation of H +
3 [40] or for triple ionization by fast heavy ion impact [41]. We
follow this work of Schulz et al and sort the ﬁnal relative energies ǫi according to the
corresponding scattering angle θi: the relative energy of the electron with the smallest
θ = θmin is measured from the base of the triangle, the ǫ for the biggest θ = θmax
from the right side and the intermediate ǫ(θmed) from the left side.

Figure 10 shows the resulting distributions, when Cohen’s distribution is used as
the target initial state in panel (a) and with the microcanonical distribution in (b).
Their overall structure is similar: the maximum is at the top of the triangles, which
means that the highest (relative) energy mainly goes with the smallest scattering
angle. This is consistent with the cross section of ﬁgure 9.

With Cohen’s distribution the plot is asymmetric with respect to ǫ(θmed) and
ǫ(θmax): when ǫ(θmin) is big, i.e., the fastest electron is scattered into the forward
direction, then the energy of the electron with the biggest angle is higher than that of
the electron with the intermediate θmed. This region is marked with “1” in ﬁgure 10(a).
And then there is a whole band of events near the right side of the triangle, labelled
with “2”, where ǫ(θmax) is very small and ǫ(θmed) is the biggest. This corresponds
to the central region of scattering angles in ﬁgure 7: the projectile, which is not the
fastest electron any more, is emitted under small angles and one of the target electrons
got a large transfer of energy from the projectile.

With the microcanonical distribution, ﬁgure 10(b), it can be seen again that
events for small ǫi are missing. The plot is more symmetric, too. In region “1” both
ǫ(θmed) and ǫ(θmax) are about equal, the correlation between the scattering angle and
the ﬁnal energy of the two slow electrons is nearly gone. Region “2” is similar to panel
(a), though: this could already be expected from the angular distribution of the fastest
and the projectile electron — which was not shown for the microcanonical distribution.
This symmetry between the two slow electrons continues from high values of ǫ(θmin)
to low values: region “3”, which is essentially empty for Cohen’s distribution, is nearly
as important as “2”: this, too, shows that the correlation between ﬁnal angles and
energies is much less pronounced for the “constructed” microcanonical distribution
than for the more quantal distribution according to Cohen.

The corresponding plot from the product distribution again looks like a blurred

version of the result from Cohen’s distribution: it is not shown here.

From ﬁgure 10(a) two modes can be inferred, in which the three electrons leave

Classical electron impact double ionization of helium

20

the nucleus: in region “1” the fastest electron is emitted into the smallest angle, then
comes the slowest electron and the electron with the intermediate energy leaves with
the biggest angle; the slowest electron is between the faster ones. In region “2” this
pattern is reversed: the fastest electron is between the two slower ones, but again with
the bias that high ﬁnal energies prefer small scattering angles.

The analogous pattern is observed when the relative angles between the electrons’
momenta in their center of mass system are plotted in a Dalitz plot. Then, one ﬁnds
that the electron that is scattered into the most forward direction has preferentially
the highest energy, followed by the one scattered into the most backward direction.
The electron inbetween gets the smallest amount of energy. These plots are not shown
here, because they provide no more information than the ones of ﬁgure 10.

Summarizing one can say that at this rather low impact energy of 250 eV, where
the total energy of the whole system is just about twice as large as the target’s binding
energy, the double ionization dynamics is much more complex than at high energies.
There the projectile is very fast and can be reduced to a sudden perturbation, whereas
it here is — classically speaking — only twice as fast as the target electrons. Now after
the reaction the fastest electron is not neccessarily the former projectile any more, as
we have seen from the angle diﬀerential one electron cross section. This distinction is
of course only possible in our classical treatment, but not in the experiment.

The doubly diﬀerential one electron cross section indicates two emission patterns:
fast electrons essentially show up in a cone of about 20◦ around the forward direction,
while the slow electrons are emitted into the rear half sphere. The crossover between
these two regimes takes place at electron energies of 50 to 60 eV, at about a third of
the total energy.

Due to the low yield of double ionization trajectories and the high dimensionality
of the three–electron ﬁnal state phase space we could not extract fully diﬀerential
cross sections from these calculations, but correcllation eﬀects between the electrons’
ﬁnal angles and energies can already be observed: high energies go with small angles,
as already shown, and the scattering angle of the slowest electron is between the two
faster ones — or the other way around: the fastest electron emerges between the two
slow ones.

This cross sections again emphasizes that also at this low impact energy it is
important to use an initial state distribution which reproduces the wave function
as closely as possible, i.e., one which is derived from the quantum wave function.
We see diﬀerences in the quality of the obtained cross sections between Cohen’s
distribution and the product description, but the general results are the same, whereas
the microcanonical distribution, which is constructed from a classical background,
leads to artifacts and gives diﬀerent results when it comes to the correlation between
the electrons.

4. Summary

In this paper we demonstrated that our quasiclassical ansatz allows to calculate
meaningful total and diﬀerential ionization cross sections on helium targets by means
of a classical trajectory method. To this end we ﬁrst explained how the algorithm [11],
which initially had been developed with the hydrogen target, has to be adapted for
many electron targets. It is especially important not to neglect the initial backward
propagation that arises from translating the scattering operator from the quantum
Møller formulation to its classical form. The resulting dynamical stabilization of the

Classical electron impact double ionization of helium

21

autoionizing classical many electron target had been demonstrated already in a recent
letter [12], together with the total cross sections for single and double ionization.

In this paper we took a closer look at the calculated total double ionization cross
section and concluded from its 1/E2 high energy behavior that the dominant process
for double ionization consists of two independent encounters between the projectile
and the two target electrons (the “TS2” process). This conjecture was then conﬁrmed
by comparing our diﬀerential cross sections to experimental results at 2 keV impact
energy. Both the relative angle between the two slow electrons and their joint energy
distribution show no signatures of the sequential “TS1” process, but the cross sections
are easily explained if only the “TS2” process takes place.

For impact energies below about 300 eV the total cross section σ(2) reproduces
the experiment amazingly well. Therefore classical calculations should focus on this
low energy regime, where it is hard to perform quantum calculations. Though there
are no experiments available yet, we presented single and double diﬀerential cross
sections at 250 eV.

In a classical calculation it is possible to label the electrons. With the calculations
at 250 eV we showed that at low impact energies the identiﬁcation of the fastest
electron with the projectile starts to break down. Combining the three electrons’
relative energies into one plot we could identify a pattern, in which the electrons’
energies are “interleaved” with their scattering angle out of the forward direction:
when the electrons are sorted according to their scattering angle then either the
electron with the highest or with the lowest ﬁnal energy is the middle one, but it
is relatively unlikely that, e.g., the electrons’ energies decrease monotonically with
increasing angle. Of course, we are anxious to see, whether the experiment will conﬁrm
our predictions — or not.

When performing the calculations on hydrogen it had been important to choose
a phase space description for the target atom that best describes those features which
are important in the corresponding energy range. We therefore ran the calculations on
helium with three diﬀerent initial distributions, too: two derived from the quantum
wave function and one built from a classical approach. The two quantum derived
distributions only diﬀer in the quality of the resulting cross sections, whereas the
classically derived one leads to artifacts, which clearly stem from its conceptual
limitations. Consequently it is important to choose — within the constraints of
feasibility and numerical eﬀort — the best initial phase space distribution possible
for the target: the classical calculation itself is a rather crude approximation, when it
comes to the quantum contributions to the cross sections, but an inappropriate initial
state will spoil even the classical parts.

The cross sections shown here are by no means exhaustive and at 250 eV they
still have to be conﬁrmed by experiment. They demonstrate that it now is possible
to perform classical trajectory calculations on multi electron targets, in this case
on helium, and that they yield reasonable results. These classical calculations will
eventually not explain every single feature of any arbitrary cross section, but as they
reproduce the classical parts of the reaction’s outcome they guide the identiﬁcation of
the quantum reaction paths and contributions to the complex low energy dynamics
and cross sections.

It should be emphasized that this quasiclassical ansatz is very similar to standard
CTMC and that it is easy to include the initial backward propagation to stabilize
arbitrary unstable initial target descriptions into existing CTMC codes — only the
interpretation of each single trajectory as one realization of the actual experiment has

to be discarded. Cross sections are, as in a discretized quantum approach, calculated
only from the whole set of the trajectories’ ﬁnal values.

Further work will focus on the region of very low impact energies to see how the
predicted power law at the threshold will be reproduced and how good the absolute
cross sections coincide with experimental results.

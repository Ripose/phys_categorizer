We propose a new kind of toroidal trap, designed for ultracold atoms. It relies on a combination
of a magnetic trap for rf-dressed atoms, which creates a bubble-like trap, and a standing wave of
light. We study the trap characteristics for a set of experimentally accessible parameters. The trap
loading procedure is also addressed, as well as the question of dimensionality of a Bose-Einstein
condensate in the ring potential.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, much work has been devoted to study
theoretically and experimentally ultra cold neutral atoms
in very elongated traps, where the atomic cloud ap-
proaches the one-dimensional regime [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
The situation under consideration is usually a one dimen-
sional harmonic oscillator, either a single trap [2, 3, 4, 5]
or a series of such harmonic traps [6, 7, 8]. New physics
appears if the trap is now closed onto itself, with peri-
odic boundary conditions. Guiding a matter wave on a
torus is now thoroughly investigated by several groups
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The motivations are clearly to-
wards the realization of inertial sensors and gyroscopes
on one side even if a torus geometry is also of great ad-
vantage in the measurement of quantal phases. On the
other side a torus trap ﬁlled in with a degenerate atomic
gas is also a source of inspiration for fundamental ques-
tions related to the coherence and superﬂuid properties
of this trapped atomic wave. Gupta et al. have pro-
duced a Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring-shaped mag-
netic waveguide [12] for the purpose of observing persis-
tent quantized circulation and related propagation phe-

tric ﬁelds [15]. The toroidal trap geometry and loading
we propose here is based on an adiabatic transforma-
tion of a radio-frequency two-dimensional trapping po-
tential [16] by the addition of a standing optical wave.
The obtained toroidal trap will exhibit the shape of a
Saturnian ring. This hollow disk shape oﬀers a new sit-
uation to study vortices since its internal diameter is or-
ders of magnitude larger than the healing length of an
atomic condensate. It may then exhibit a geometry that
allows an irrotational motion without disruption inside
the trap. Other questions may arise on the spontaneous
formation of vortices in a similar way as was observed by
Stock et al. [17].

The paper is organized as follows : in sections II - IV
the trap is described, the lifetime in the trap is addressed
and the experimental parameters are discussed in this
framework. Section V deals with the low dimensional
regimes. Section VI is speciﬁc to the loading process.
An outlook and a conclusion are given in Section VII.
The calculations of the chemical potentials are consigned
to appendixes A and B.

II. TRAP DESCRIPTION

This new trap is the superposition of two diﬀerent
traps, an egg shell trap (ZG-trap) relying on a magnetic
trapping ﬁeld and rf coupling, combined with a standing
wave of light. The principle of the rf-dressed potentials
was explained elsewhere [16, 18], but let us recall here
the main features, for instance in the case of 87Rb, F = 2
ground state. An inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of norm
B(r) presenting a local minimum (the base of a mag-
netic trap) is used together with a rf coupling between
mF Zeeman substates created by an oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld Brf cos(ωrf t). This results in a dressing of the mF
states, as represented on Figure 1, and the potential ex-
perienced by the upper adiabatic state reads:

Here, mF = F = 2 for 87Rb and VB(r) = gLµBB(r)
is the potential created by the magnetic trap alone for
F = 2, mF = 1, where gL is the Land´e factor and µB the
Bohr magneton, ∆ = ωrf
ω0 is the detuning between

the rf applied frequency and the resonant frequency at
the magnetic potential minimum, and Ω = gLµBBrf /2¯h
is the Rabi frequency of rf coupling [19]. The potential
minimum of this new trap sits on an iso-B surface, as
Vd(r) has a minimum for VB(r) = ¯h∆, that is on the
surface deﬁned by gLµBB(r) = ¯h∆.
In the following,
we will concentrate on the case of a quadrupolar trap
with z as symmetry axis [20]. Note that in this case the
magnetic ﬁeld in the center is zero, so that ∆ = ωrf. Let
b′ be the ﬁeld gradient in the radial direction, and let us

and the relevant iso-B surface is an ellipsoid of equation
0, where ρ2 = x2 + y2 and the radius r0 is
ρ2 + 4z2 = r2
related to ∆ through r0 = ∆/α, typically much greater
than a micrometer. In the presence of gravity, the atoms
fall to the bottom of this shell and the resulting trapped
cloud is in a quasi 2D geometry. This situation was re-
cently demonstrated experimentally in a Ioﬀe-Pritchard
type trap [21]. It was also used in an atom chip experi-
ment for producing a double well potential [22].

Let us now add an optical standing wave to this egg
shell trap, along the vertical z direction, blue detuned by
δ > 0 with respect to an atomic dipolar transition [23]
and with identical linear polarization for the two laser
beams (Figure 4). The light shift creates a periodic po-
tential of period λ/2 where λ is the light wavelength.
Along z, the atoms are then conﬁned in a series of par-
allel planes. In a given plane, their altitude is ﬁxed to
z = z0 better than a fraction of λ. As a result, if they
also experience the adiabatic rf potential in a quadrupole
trap, the atoms sit on a circle, the intersection of that
plane and the iso-B ellipsoid, deﬁned by ρ = R of radius
R =
0 much greater than λ (Figure 2). This is
the circular trap we are interested in.

U0 is assumed to be large enough for the tunnel eﬀect be-
tween successive planes to be negligible (see section III).
Note that the potential does not depend on the azimuthal

larization.

Let us focus on the plane situated around z = 0, so that
z0 = 0 and R = r0. In principle, the trapping potential
mixes the radial (ρ) and axial (z) coordinates. However,
the constraints on ρ and z are such that the potential
may be written to a good approximation as a sum of in-
dependent potentials Vρ(ρ) and Vz(z) for the radial and
axial coordinates respectively. Indeed, due to the pres-

d = Ω/α, the length scale of the conﬁning surface (see
Eq. 2) which is on the order of a few micrometers; the z
dependance may thus be omitted in Vd. In the same way,
ρ extends over d which is small as compared to the waist
w. This waist should be chosen of the order of the radius
r0 (see section IV), that is a few hundred micrometers,
and then ρ may simply be replaced by r0 in the expres-
sion of the light shift. Within these assumptions, the
single particle hamiltonian becomes separable in ρ and z
and one can calculate independently oscillation frequen-
cies along z and ρ around z = 0 and ρ = r0 for an atom

III. LIFETIME IN THE RING TRAP

In the ring trap, the lifetime may be limited by sev-
eral processes, apart from the collisions with the back-
ground gas. In this section, we discuss these losses for
the groundstate or for thermal atoms.

First, as the atoms are conﬁned in a rf-dressed state,
they may undergo non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transi-
tions to an untrapped spin state due to motional cou-
pling. This will happen along the radial axis, where the
potential changes more rapidly. The transition rate ΓLZ
may be estimated by averaging over the velocity distri-
bution the transition probabilities PLZ for a given radial
velocity vρ [24]:

The loss rate to other spin states is deduced from this
transition probability by multiplying by twice the radial
oscillation frequency, as the transition may occur at each
crossing. With the parameters given above, the transi-
1
tion rate is limited to ΓLZ = ωρ/π
0.075 s−
for a thermal cloud of temperature 3 µK. For atoms in
the vibrational ground-state of the dressed potential, the
approach of Ref. [18], Eq.(10) may be generalized to a F
spin state as done in Ref. [24]. The transition rate is then
πΩ/(2√2ωρ)].
approximately Γgs ≃
This leakage is negligible for the parameters of Table I.
Second, we shall consider the issue of tunneling of the
atoms between the vertical lattice sites. For a horizon-
tal lattice – that is, without the eﬀect of gravity – the
tunneling amplitude per atom J is related to the lat-
tice depth. In the tight binding limit, where the lattice
is much higher than the re-
depth V0 = 2U0 e−
coil energy ER = h2/(2mλ2), J scales approximately as
2.12√V0/ER [25]. In the case discussed here,

V0 = 32 ER and the tunneling rate J/h is only 1.3 Hz.

This rate is even smaller when gravity is taken into ac-
count, as it splits the degeneracy between neighbouring
ground states by a value mgλ/2h = 1/τB = 822 Hz (τB
is the Bloch period). For the given lattice depth, we are
deeply in the adiabatic limit and the atoms remain in the
ground state band and experience Bloch oscillations: if
one starts with atoms in a single lattice well (a Wannier
state), after a Bloch period they are all back in the same
well. Moreover, the amplitude of these Bloch oscillations
in space is very small (2 nm). Only ﬁnite size eﬀects, lat-
tice imperfections or excitations to the ﬁrst excited band
would prevent the exact return to initial condition. Tun-
neling should not be an issue for this trap, at least for
the parameters mentioned above.

Finally, photon scattering may lead to heating and trap
losses. These processes are quite small for blue detuned
lattice light, because the atoms only signiﬁcantly scatter
photons when they leave the very center of a lattice well.
In a given well, the scattering rate per atom is related to
the cloud spreading

This simpliﬁes to Γsc = Γ ωz/4δ in the ground state
of the vertical motion, and to Γsc = Γ kBT /2¯hδ for a
thermal gas. The corresponding calculated values are

1 for the groundstate and Γsc = 0.25 s−
Γsc = 0.08 s−
for a thermal gas at 3 µK, or equivalently a heating rate
of 30 nK/s and 90 nK/s respectively [26].

IV. CHOICE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL
PARAMETERS

In this section we propose a strategy for an optimal
choice of the laser, magnetic ﬁeld and rf ﬁeld parame-
ters. A correct choice of these experimental parameters
should allow one to have a ring trap as large as possi-
ble, with high vertical and transverse oscillation frequen-
cies, and reasonable values for magnetic, RF and optical
ﬁelds, while minimizing the spontaneous photon scatter-
ing rate and tunneling between neighbouring wells. With
this objective, it appears that the magnetic gradient and
the laser power should be chosen as large as possible:
only technical issues will limit this choice. We thus ﬁx
these parameters to values easily obtainable experimen-
tally, that is a laser power of 0.5 W, available for instance
from a Titanium Sapphire laser, and a magnetic gradient
b′ = 150 G/cm, corresponding to a gradient of 300 G/cm
in the axis of the quadrupole coils, already realized in
a previous experiment [27]. b′ is related directly to the
parameter α introduced in section II.

An important remark concerns the choice of the beam
waist w, for a desired ring radius r0. There is an optimal
choice, maximizing the lattice depth and consequently
the vertical oscillation frequency. The waist should be
equal to w = √2 r0, the √2 coeﬃcient corresponding to
the maximum of the function 1
, as can be deduced

1/x

2

x e−

from Eq.(6). This ﬁxes the relation between the light
shift in the beam centre U0 and the lattice depth: V0 =
2U0/e.

Once these values are ﬁxed, we impose constraints
on the possible losses or heating rates discussed in sec-
tion III, that is on the tunneling rate J, the scattering
rate Γsc, and the Landau-Zener transition rate ΓLZ. We
set these rates respectively to a given J0, to some small
fraction ε of the natural linewidth (Γsc = εΓ) and to
ΓLZ = γ. Now, the choice of J imposes the standing
wave depth V0 (see section III), as well as the vertical
oscillation frequency ωz, directly related to V0 and ER
through ¯hωz = 2√V0ER. This in turn gives the detuning
to be chosen for limiting the photon scattering rate in
the ground state to εΓ: δ = ωz/4ε (see section III). The
light shift U0 is known from its ﬁxed relation with V0,
and as the laser power P and the detuning δ have been
chosen, the waist w can be deduced from the knowledge
of U0. From w one gets r0 = w/√2 and the rf detuning
∆ = αr0. The only remaining parameter is then the rf
Rabi frequency Ω, which is chosen to ﬁt the desired value
of γ.

We applied this procedure to desired values of J/h =
1 at 3 µK to obtain
1 and γ = 0.1 s−

1 Hz, εΓsc = 0.1 s−
the typical parameter values suggested in table I.

V. CONDITIONS FOR REACHING THE LOW
DIMENSIONAL REGIME

An interesting feature of this ring trap is its high oscil-
lation frequency in the transverse direction. It is thus rel-
evant to raise the question of dimensionality of a denener-
ate gas conﬁned in this trap. This question has acquired
a growing interest in the last 5 years, and is related for
instance to the creation of anyons [28] or the fermioniza-
tion of the excitations in the bosonic cloud [29]. Already
in a 3D elongated condensate, the coherence properties
are aﬀected by the geometry [1, 4, 30, 31]. To estimate
in which regime (1D, 2D or 3D) the gas has to be con-
sidered, we compare the chemical potential, calculated
in the Thomas Fermi approximation under a given di-
mensionality assumption, to the trapping oscillation fre-
quencies. The three regimes (3D, 2D or 1D) correspond
respectively to µ > ¯hωz, ¯hωρ < µ < ¯hωz and µ < ¯hωρ.
The cross-over between one regime and another may be
given in terms of atom number in the trap. Detailed cal-
culations of the chemical potential in the diﬀrent regimes
are given in appendix A.

Let us ﬁrst estimate the 3D Thomas-Fermi chemical

of the condensate wave function in the Thomas-Fermi
approximation. The 3D interaction strength is g3D =
4π¯h2a/m, a = 5.4 nm being the 3D scattering length.
In the harmonic approximation, the chemical potential
is given by the formula of Eq.(A5) [32]:

given above. This number is suﬃciently high that it is
feasible to have a condensate which is at least in a two-
dimensional regime, without any diﬃculty in imaging it.
With 105 atoms for instance, the chemical potential cor-
responds to µ3D/h = 8.9 kHz, which is below the highest
oscillation frequency of 43 kHz. The total energy per
atom does not allow us to populate transverse (z) excita-
tions, and the vertical degree of freedom is frozen. Such
a degenerate gas would thus be at least in the 2D regime
and the chemical potential has to be recalculated within
a 2D hypothesis.

In the 2D case, the interaction strength is modiﬁed and
reads g2D = g3D/(π√2lz) = 2√2¯h2a/(mlz) where lz =
¯h/(mωz) is the ground state of the harmonic oscillator
in the frozen direction [33]. Again, the chemical potential
p
in 2D is deduced from normalization of the integrated
density to the atom number in the Thomas-Fermi regime,
Eq.(A8):

The gas would be in the 1D regime if the 2D chemical
potential is of the order of, or less than the radial oscilla-
tion frequency ωρ. This corresponds to an atom number
104 for the proposed

parameters. A uniform 1D gas of density n1 = N/(2πr0)
would have an interaction strength g1D = g3D/(2πlzlρ) =

(11)

Again, this expression is valid if the kinetic energy is
negligible as compared to the mean-ﬁeld energy. How-
ever, even if this is the case, longitudinal excited states
(along the ring) are likely to be populated as the excita-
tion frequency is only of the order of 1 mHz. With such
a 1D system, the gas could be in the Tonks-Girardeau
regime [29, 34] if the parameter γ = mg1D/(¯h2n1) is
much larger than 1. For our parameters, this would cor-
respond to very few atoms, i.e. much less than the γ = 1
limit of 850 atoms. With a larger atom number (a few
thousand), we should instead have a quasi-condensate
with a ﬂuctuating phase [33].

In conclusion to this section,

let us stress that an
atomic cloud conﬁned in the ring trap proposed in this
paper would easily be in the 2D regime, the vertical (z)
degree of freedom being frozen. With the parameters
of table I, it would be true for an atom number between
106. The 1D regime is achievable with
2.7
a smaller number of atoms, but the Tonks-Girardeau

regime would require a few hundred atoms only, and the
detection of the atomic cloud would then be an issue.

VI. LOADING

A condensate in the proposed ring trap would cover
quite a small volume spread over a relatively large area,
and as a result the method used to load the atoms into the
trap needs to be considered carefully. This is because of
the mismatch between the starting point, a condensate in
a magnetic trap, which may be spheroidal and localised,
and the end-point, a condensate in a ring trap which has
essentially no overlap with the starting point at all.

There may be several approaches to loading the pro-
posed ring trap. Based on a previous experiment [27],
which used a QUIC trap, our proposed loading method
takes place in at least ﬁve stages [(i-v) below] and is il-
lustrated in Figure 3. In the following we refer to a BEC
for convenience. The steps are the same for a cold atom
cloud, but a condensate has an advantage of compact-
ness.

(i) Dressed trap loading: Starting with the mag-
netic trap, Fig.3(a), the condensate is ﬁrst transferred
to the ﬁeld-dressed atom trap (ZG-trap) by an estab-
lished loading procedure [16, 21] in which a rf ﬁeld is
steadily increased in intensity at a ﬁxed, negative, de-
tuning (relative to the magnetic trap centre) and sub-
sequently ramped up in frequency to positive detuning
(see Fig.3(b)). This accomplishes a transfer to ﬁeld-
dressed potentials, like those in Eq. (2), which are subse-
quently expanded outwards from the trap centre as seen
in Fig.3(c). (This rf expansion is discussed further in (ii),
below.)

In the resulting trap the condensate lies in an electro-
magnetic potential which conﬁnes it to the surface of an
ellipsoid, or egg-shell as in section II. This surface is rep-
resented by the ellipse in Fig.3(b-f). However, gravity,
and the absence of the optical potential, ensures that the
condensate occupies just the lower part of the ellipsoid
surface, when the ellipsoid is suﬃciently large, and as
seen in Fig.3(c). As mentioned in section II the egg-shell
is deﬁned, for a particular rf frequency, by the surface
of resonance between the magnetic sub-levels and the rf.
Thus the size of the ellipsoid, or egg-shell, depends on
the rf frequency; so as the rf frequency is increased, the
part of the condensate at the the bottom of the egg shell
moves downwards and becomes ﬂatter. This is the rf ex-
pansion phase and is represented by the transition from
Fig.3(b) to Fig.3(c).

(ii) RF expansion: The condensate would thus be ﬂat-
tened. The aim is to ﬂatten it suﬃciently to be able
to load it as eﬃciently as possible into a single corruga-
tion of the optical potential created by the blue-detuned
standing wave. The best case would be if the condensate
could be ﬂattened to match its width in the optical po-
tential. In practice we would expect diﬃculties with this
step. Physical constraints on the size of the magnetic

coils and the ﬁelds they produce mean that it can be
hard to make a condensate with many atoms suﬃciently
thin, without retaining some of the curvature of the egg-
shell. Thus a curved standing wave would be ideal, since
it would match better the shape of the curved conden-
sate. However, from the experimental point-of-view this
would be complicated to set up and adjust. Thus we will
consider a planar standing wave in what follows. In this
case it means that when the standing wave is applied
the condensate may be sliced into a number of rings and
a central disc. Fig.3(d) shows a disc and just one such
ring as an example. Each ring would be formed from
condensate collected within a distance given by the well
separation of the optical potential (i.e. within a range of
λ/2).

Since the aim is to study the condensate properties in
one of the rings, it is important to estimate the fraction of

−

2(r

condensate that might be lost from the principal ring in
the loading process. An estimate can be formed by con-
sidering the Thomas-Fermi approximation for the con-
densate density in the egg-shell trap. A simple model of
R)2/2
the trap consists of a radial potential mωtrans
representing the shell with a local curvature R, a local
oscillation frequency ωtrans in the ‘shell’, and a simpliﬁed
gravitational potential (see Appendix B). As a numer-
ical example, we consider 105 atoms in a dressed trap
with an underlying magnetic trap with the parameters
given in section IV and a rf intensity leading to the same
2.26 kHz. With
dressed trapping frequency ωtrans = 2π
the rf chosen such that the condensate lies at a distance
of 107 µm below the magnetic trap centre, the Thomas-
Fermi solution, see Appendix B, gives a condensate with
a maximum total thickness of 0.60 µm, a horizontal full
width of 56 µm and a height (from the resonance point)
of 0.92 µm. The height and maximum thickness are in
the region of twice the proposed optical well separation of
0.39 µm. The number of atoms caught in the load-
λ/2
ing process can be estimated by integrating the Thomas-
Fermi solution over a vertical distance of λ/2. In this ex-
ample we ﬁnd that at best 60% of atoms could be loaded
into a single well, and roughly 3 other rings are populated
to a lesser extent.

∼

×

In this example the condensate is already close to a
two-dimensional regime. If we increase the displacement
of the condensate, by increasing the rf frequency and
keeping other parameters constant, we ﬁnd that there
is a slight reduction in thickness and height, but even
at a displacement of 200 µm the thickness is 0.53 µm
with the other parameters as given.
Increasing the rf
in this way also has side-eﬀects, such as a reduction in
the lateral oscillation frequency
g/z0/2 and consequent
increased loading time. We note that if curvature were
more of a problem than thickness, the situation could
be improved by the application of red-detuned light to
attract the atoms, temporarily, into the centre. Such a
horizontal conﬁnement may cause some increase in (verti-
cal) thickness, for a given number of atoms, and so there
may still have to be a trade-oﬀ between the curvature
of the condensate and its thickness. An increase in ei-
ther thickness, or curvature, could result in atoms be-
ing spread amongst several other optical wells when the
standing wave is applied.

p

(iii) Improve magnetic trap geometry: As soon as the
condensate has moved away from the centre of the mag-
netic trap, it is advantageous to improve the magnetic
conﬁguration by removing any bias ﬁelds needed in the
original magnetic trap. For example, with a QUIC trap
conﬁguration we can achieve a quadrupole ﬁeld by turn-
ing oﬀ the Ioﬀe coil. This will result in a circularly sym-
metric ring trap at the ﬁnal stage, and by doing this
while the condensate is still fairly localised, we again re-
duce the demands of adiabaticity on the time-scales of
the system. (As soon as the condensate has moved away
from the centre of the trap there is no longer any need
to worry about any Majorana transitions.)

6

(iv) Application of optical potential: Now the blue-
detuned standing wave can be applied and as many atoms
as possible are trapped in a single well, or corrugation, of
the optical potential. Figure 3(d) shows a case where a
single other well is also populated. The light is switched
on relatively slowly so as not to cause any excitation of
the condensate.

We note that the option exists, at this point in the
loading sequence, to remove unwanted atoms from some
of the optical wells by applying an rf ‘scalpel’. However,
this procedure would require an adiabatic unloading and
reloading of the dressed rf trap, which can be done, but
adds to the overall loading time.

(v) Ring expansion: The ﬁnal stage of the loading pro-
cess is to form the condensate ring by changing the ver-
tical position of the blue-detuned potential well relative
to the rf resonance point, or egg-shell.
If we consider
the standing wave as comprised of two travelling waves,
this can be done by simply changing the phase of one
of the travelling wave components. When this is done
the standing wave pattern can be moved upwards. As
this happens, the conﬁnement to the egg-shell of the
rf trap ensures the formation of a ring of condensate.
The ring expands outwards as it is raised upwards (Fig.
3(e)). During this expansion the orientation of the softer
rf trapping changes from the vertical to the horizontal
and the condensate will adopt the shape of a Saturnian
ring which becomes narrower when the rf trapping is fully
in the horizontal direction.

Clearly, the ring reaches a point of maximum circular
radius when its centre is at the centre of the quadrupole
trap. However, we note that whilst the magnitude of
the magnetic ﬁeld remains constant, the orientation of

FIG. 4: (Color online) Coils and laser conﬁguration for pro-
ducing and exciting the ring trap. The trap is the combination
of a vertical light standing wave (blue beam on the ﬁgure) and
an egg shell rf trap (see section II). This egg shell trap re-
lies on a magnetic ﬁeld gradient (produced by the quadrupole
coils) and rf coupling between Zeeman sub levels (two rf coils
in quadrature as described in section VI). The additional
“spinning” coils could be used for exciting the rotation of the
atoms inside the ring trap (see section VII).

the magnetic ﬁeld changes as the ring is raised. Since
the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld is important in the
orientation of the antenna (see note [19]) this would ne-
cessitate switching between diﬀerent antennas at about
the half-way point. A problem that then emerges is that
the rf trapping becomes asymmetrical as soon as the ring
starts to expand, and consequently, until the switching
occurs, the ring is squeezed more tightly in one direction.
A better solution to the problem of the orientation of the
antenna avoids any switching by utilizing a rf magnetic
ﬁeld rotating in the horizontal plane. This ﬁeld can be
generated by two rf coils at right angles to each other
(Figure 4). When the condensate is at the bottom of the
egg-shell potential, the magnetic ﬁeld is basically verti-
cal and provided the rf ﬁeld is rotating in the correct
direction the rf dressed trapping is fully eﬀective. When
the condensate is at the horizontal extremum of the egg-
shell, i.e. forming a ring, the magnetic ﬁeld is horizontal
and at each point on the ring the rotating ﬁeld always
has one ineﬀective component and an eﬀective compo-
nent perpendicular to the local static magnetic ﬁeld. As
a result the rf trapping is uniform around the ring with-
out needing to switch. The reduced eﬀective amplitude
can be compensated by an increase in rf power as the
ring expanded to its full radius.

Finally, we note that instead of raising the standing
wave pattern, the ring could also be expanded by further
increase of the rf detuning. This would force the ring
outwards at the same vertical position, i.e. at 107 µm
below the magnetic trap centre in the example given.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have seen how a ring trap for cold
atoms can be made from a combination of magnetic, rf
and optical ﬁelds. It is the combination of these ﬁelds
which makes possible a trap with suﬃcient tightness that
it could hold 2D and even 1D condensates. Many of the
physical parameters of the trap are the result of practical
compromises which have been tested in this paper. For
example, the leakage in the optical trap component is
traded oﬀ against practical laser power and reduced pho-
ton scattering. The leakage of the rf trapping component
is traded oﬀ against its tightness. The number of atoms
should be suﬃciently high that it can be easily imaged.
Additional calculations have shown that a small tilting
of the trap will not adversly aﬀect it. The ring trap also
has to have a loading scheme and a possibility has been
presented in this paper which involves careful orientation
of the rf antennae to maintain rf trapping as the atom
ring is formed. A set of feasible parameters for the trap
has been presented which still leaves room for later op-
timisation and yet would allow the demonstration of the
ring trap and low-dimensional eﬀects.

Once the atom ring is created it could be excited, or
manipulated, with the application of a periodic pertur-
bation. Optical ‘paddles’ can be used to good eﬀect (see

7

e.g. Ref. [35]), but another way to do this would be with
a rotating deformation of the ring. This can be achieved
with the magnetic ﬁeld from two pairs of coils, each of
which is in an anti-Helmholtz conﬁguration with its axis
oriented in the horizontal plane and at a 45◦ angle to the
axis of the other pair (Figure 4). Each pair of coils can
perturb the circular shape of the ring trap on its own. It
can be shown that one pair of these coils results in an
ellipse with a diﬀerence in radii of

δr0

r0 ,

(12)

where δb′ is the magnetic ﬁeld gradient produced along
the axis of the coils. By applying a time-dependent func-
tion to the current of the pairs of coils the elliptical trap
can be continuously rotated. This may initiate a col-
lective movement, or excitation, of the trapped cloud or
condensate as has been explored in some theoretical pa-
pers [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. As well as studying persistent
currents the trap makes an interesting topology to study
solitons in three and less dimensions [38]. Furthermore,
it would be possible to study the implosion of an atom
ring, and the eﬀect of repulsive interactions, by switching
oﬀ the rf coupling. The magnetic ﬁeld would then cause
some components of the BEC to be expelled, and some
to be drawn into the centre where the atom ring would
be turned inside-out after some eﬀect of the interactions.

FOR THE RING TRAP IN 3D, 2D AND 1D

In this section, we give a detailed calculation of the
chemical potential in the Thomas-Fermi approximation
for the ring trap in the harmonic approximation, depend-
ing on the dimension. Let us ﬁrst consider the 3D case.
The 3D density is related to the ring trapping potential

3D regime:

Here, we have used the expressions for Rρ and Rz
given above, the 3D interaction coupling constant g3D =
4π¯h2a/m, and the geometric mean of the oscillation fre-
quencies ¯ω = √ωρωz.

If now the vertical degree of freedom is frozen, the gas
enters the 2D regime. The condensate wave function is
the product of the harmonic oscillator ground state along
z, of size lz =
¯h/(mωz), and a 2D wave function in
the plane, satisfying a 2D Thomas-Fermi equation. The
expression for the chemical potential should be calculated
from integration of the 2D density, deduced from this
equation in the harmonic approximation:

in the 2D regime reads

The groundstate has a uniform density along the ring
n1D = N/(2πr0), in the Thomas-Fermi approximation,
and we have g1Dn1D = µ1D. The interaction coupling
constant is given by g1D = g3D/(2πlzlρ) = 2¯h2a/(mlzlρ)
[33]. We obtain directly the chemical potential from this
set of equations, as

APPENDIX B: THOMAS-FERMI SOLUTION
FOR THE TIGHT SHELL TRAP

Before the optical potential is applied in the loading
process the trap potential is that of a dressed rf shell
trap in the presence of gravity which results in the atoms
collecting at the bottom of the shell.
In order to esti-
mate the capture eﬃciency when the optical potential is
applied we utilize the density in the rf trap from the
three-dimensional Thomas-Fermi solution. Thus posi-
tive densities satisfy n(r, θ) = (µ
V (r, θ))/g3D where
g3D = 4π¯h2a/m. We then approximate the potential for
the atoms, Eq. (3) with U0 = 0, by

−

V (r, θ) =

(B1)

This potential assumes a tight binding to a shell with
a local radius of curvature R. For the ellipsoid geome-
try of section II this means R = 4z0 = 2r0. The shell
binding frequency ωtrans also has the value local to the
bottom of the shell and is assumed independent of radial
distance r and angle θ. This independence is not strictly
true because the eﬀective rf amplitude and ﬁeld gradient
vary with angle. For a given eﬀective rf amplitude, and
for the ellipsoidal geometry of section II the frequency
ωtrans at the bottom of the trap is twice radial rf trap-
ping frequency ωρ in the ring [Eq. (5)]. The gravitational
sag of the shell is also neglected, and varies with position,
but this is expected to be small for realistic parameters.
To ﬁnd the chemical potential we may use a 3D har-
monic approximation since the shell approximation is
already a radial harmonic potential and the maximum
value for θ, for parameters given, is 0.07 radians, allow-
ing the angular part to be harmonic, too. The angular
frequency is the same as the pendulum frequency, i.e.
g/R. Thus we may use the standard 3D harmonic re-

with the geometric mean of the oscillation frequencies
¯ω = (ωtransg/R)1/3, and a0 =

potential found from all the approximations given above
agrees well with a numerical integration and is used, with
the Thomas-Fermi solution, to estimate the number of
atoms loaded into the optical potential.

The hydrogen atom in weak external ﬁelds is a very accu-
rate model for the multiphoton excitation of ultrastable high
angular momentum Rydberg states, a process which classical
mechanics describes with astonishing precision.
In this pa-
per we show that the simplest treatment of the intramanifold
dynamics of a hydrogenic electron in external ﬁelds is based
on the elliptic states of the hydrogen atom, i.e., the coher-
ent states of SO(4), which is the dynamical symmetry group
of the Kepler problem. Moreover, we also show that clas-
sical perturbation theory yields the exact evolution in time
of these quantum states, and so we explain the surprising
match between purely classical perturbative calculations and
experiments. Finally, as a ﬁrst application, we propose a fast
method for the excitation of circular states; these are ultra-
stable hydrogenic eigenstates which have maximum total an-
gular momentum and also maximum projection of the angular
momentum along a ﬁxed direction.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the past few years innovative experimental tech-
niques have made possible the study of the dynamics of
“Rydberg” electrons, that is, atomic electrons that are
promoted to very high energy levels and that are only
weakly bound to the atomic core [1]. The spectrum of
such electrons is well described by a Rydberg-like formula
(hence their name), and their wave functions are well ap-
proximated by eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom with
very large principal quantum number (typically n >
100)
∼
[2]. Indeed, to a very good approximation the dynamics
of Rydberg electrons is hydrogenic, and more complex
atoms are often used in experiments merely as substi-
tutes for hydrogen, because it is much easier to excite
their valence electron to a Rydberg state, and yet the far-
ﬂung Rydberg electron senses a ﬁeld which does not diﬀer
much from a pure Coulomb ﬁeld. The recent experimen-
tal results have led to a renewed theoretical interest in
the hydrogen atom in external ﬁelds in the limit of large
quantum numbers, which is an exemplar for the study of
quantum-classical correspondence in nonintegrable sys-
tems [3].

Indeed, recent experiments have shown that the in-
tramanifold dynamics of large-n Rydberg electrons de-
pends strongly on the presence of even surprisingly weak
ﬁelds. This observation strongly suggests that it must
be possible to manipulate accurately the quantum state

of the electron by applying the appropriate combination
of weak, slowly varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In
fact, the theory of the hydrogen atom in weak ﬁelds is
the basis of the treatment of slow ion-Rydberg collisions,
which are generally considered to be the mechanism for
the stabilization of the high-n states used in ZEKE (zero-
electron-kinetic-energy) spectroscopy [4–6]. It also con-
stitutes the starting point for the study of alkali atoms
in weak, circularly polarized microwave ﬁelds [7–11].

An external electric ﬁeld F is “weak” when its mag-
nitude is small compared to the average Coulomb ﬁeld
sensed by the electron, that is, in atomic units (which we
use throughout this paper)

In classical mechanics Eq. (1) implies that the energy of
the Rydberg electron does not change signiﬁcantly over a
Kepler period, and classical perturbation theory applies.
The condition on a magnetic ﬁeld B is that the magni-
tude of the ﬁeld must be much smaller than the Kepler
frequency ωK = 1/n3 of the electron.

On the other hand, the quantum constraint on electric
ﬁelds for negligible intermanifold mixing is the Inglis-
Teller limit [2]

and for a very large n it may become a more stringent
constraint than the classical one. The quantum con-
straint on a magnetic ﬁeld B is

However, it has been recently shown that the more re-
laxed classical constraints hold also in quantum mechan-
ics. That is, even in the presence of some intermanifold
mixing the slow secular dynamics, due to the external
ﬁelds, is essentially the same as if the Rydberg electron
were still conﬁned within a given n-manifold, because the
time-averaged corrections due to n-mixing are negligible
for large n [12]. Therefore in this paper we consider only
the intramanifold dynamics of the Rydberg electron, and
we assume that the external ﬁelds satisfy the Inglis-Teller
limit, and also Eq. (3).

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we dis-
cuss the evolution in time of atomic elliptic states in
weak ﬁelds, and we show that they evolve exactly like
the underlying classical ellipse; in Sec. III we propose an

1

original approach to the production of circular Rydberg
states, which is based on the dynamics of the coherent
states of SO(4); ﬁnally, in Sec. IV we draw some general
conclusions.

tric and magnetic ﬁelds reads

where the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the x axis and its
strength is F ; the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the z axis
and its strength is B.

For weak ﬁelds the diamagnetic term, which is pro-
portional to the square of the ﬁeld, can be neglected.
The simpliﬁed problem has been ﬁrst solved quantum
mechanically by Demkov et al.
[13, 14]. However, their
formal solution does not provide physical insight in the
dynamics of the angular momentum of the Rydberg elec-
tron; it also becomes computationally intractable in the
limit of large n’s.

The analysis of the intramanifold dynamics in the hy-
drogen atom rests on Pauli’s replacement, which is an op-
erator identity between the position operator ˆr and the
scaled Runge-Lenz vector operator ˆa (throughout this
paper we use boldface letters for vectors, and we indicate
a quantum operator with a caret), and which holds only
within a hydrogenic n-manifold [15, 16]:

ˆr =

The angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz vector
are invariants of the Kepler problem, and they commute
with the hydrogenic Hamiltonian. By neglecting the dia-
magnetic term and using the identity of Eq. (5), in the
interaction representation the perturbation Hamiltonian
for external ﬁelds of arbitrary orientation becomes

where ωS = 3nF/2 is the Stark frequency of the electric

magnetic ﬁeld (we deﬁne the vector Larmor frequency
with a minus sign, so that the dynamics is formally iden-
tical to the one of a negative charge in a noninertial ro-
tating frame - see below).

−

The components of the angular momentum, plus those
of the Runge-Lenz vector constitute the generators of
SO(4), which is the dynamical symmetry group of the
Kepler problem [16].
It is convenient to decompose
SO(4) in the direct product of two rotation groups, i.e.
SO(4) = SO(3)
SO(3), and we consider the following
operators:

Therefore both irreducible representations of SO(3) have
the same dimension, which is related to the principal
quantum number n of the hydrogenic manifold.

Equation (9) reduces the problem to the dynamics of
two uncoupled spins in the external “magnetic ﬁelds” ω1
and ω2. The analysis is particularly simple when the two
“magnetic ﬁelds” ω1 and ω2 have constant orientation
in space. However, all the considerations below also hold
in the more general situation of arbitrary ﬁelds within
the constraints of perturbation theory [17, 18], and we
discuss explicitly the greater generality of our analysis
later in this section.
In the case of “magnetic ﬁelds”
with constant orientation the propagator is simply

The elliptic eigenstates of the hydrogen atom [19–23]
are nothing other than the coherent states of SO(4) and
therefore they can be expressed as the direct product of
two coherent states of SO(3). In turn, the coherent states
of SO(3) can be constructed quite generally by applying
any operator of the group (i.e., any rotation) to the an-
gular momentum eigenstate with maximum projection of
the angular momentum along the z axis [17, 18]:

where Ω1 and Ω2 represent 3-dimensional active rota-
tions, which respectively overlap the z axis with the unit
vectors n1 and n2.

Clearly, angular momentum eigenstates that have
maximum projection along the z axis are minimum un-
certainty states for the angular momentum [17, 18], and
(14) preserve this property. The
the rotations of Eq.
coherent states of SO(3) are then states of minimum un-
certainty for the angular momentum, and in their repre-
sentation on the unit sphere they are sharply localized
along the direction of the corresponding classical angular
momentum. Similarly, elliptic states are localized along
the directions of both classical “angular momenta” J1
and J2, i.e. along the unit vectors n1 and n2. It follows
from Eq. (8) that they also possess well localized, qua-
siclassical angular momentum L and Runge-Lenz vector
a.

Probability density (averaged along the z axis)
of an atomic elliptic state localized on the xy plane. The
principal quantum number is n = 30, and the eccentricity is
ec = 0.6. Both x and y vary between −2n2
(recall
that in atomic units the Bohr radius is equal to one), and
the nucleus is at the origin of the frame of reference. The
probability density is sharply concentrated on the xy-plane,
and we have averaged it over the z axis to show that the
electron is more likely to be far from the nucleus. The peak
at the aphelion which reﬂects the larger probability of ﬁnding
the electron away from the nucleus is a purely classical eﬀect.
Because the classical electron is slower at the aphelion than at
the perihelion it spends a longer time away from the nucleus
than in its proximity, and the classical probability of ﬁnding
a Rydberg electron far from the nucleus is larger. The ﬁgure
was produced using the elegant formula for the wave function
of atomic elliptic states derived in Ref. [20].

The classical objects that correspond to elliptic states
are points in the phase space of the Kepler problem. In
the more familiar conﬁguration space these points are
the trajectories of a classical electron in a pure Coulomb
potential, i.e., Kepler ellipses, which are completely iden-
tiﬁed by the magnitude and direction of the two classical
vectors L and a [24]. Indeed, the probability density of a
hydrogenic electron in an elliptic state is peaked precisely

3

along a Kepler ellipse (see Fig. 1).

Most importantly, it is easy to see that the propaga-
(13) is also an operator of SO(4), and so
tor of Eq.
when the propagator acts on an elliptic state it naturally
yields some other elliptic state. More precisely, elliptic
states are constructed by applying two rotation operators
which map the z axis (that is, the direction of the angular
momenta of the original states) onto some desired direc-
tions n1 and n2. Similarly, the propagator of Eq. (13)
consists of two rotations respectively around the spatial
axes given by the “magnetic ﬁelds” ω1 and ω2. The net
eﬀect of the propagator onto an elliptic state is:

The original idea of studying the dynamics of ellip-
tic states in weak ﬁelds is due to Nauenberg [23], who
treated in detail the case of orthogonal, time-dependent
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In his analysis the connec-
tion with classical mechanics emerges for a conﬁguration
of the ﬁelds which constitutes a realization of SO(3). We
generalize his results to arbitrary ﬁelds, that is, to real-
izations of SO(4), the full dynamical symmetry group of
the Hydrogen atom. Indeed, most of the interest concern-
ing elliptic states has been focused on the quasiclassical
localization properties of the electron in real space [19–
23], and the representation of elliptic states as a direct
product of two coherent states of SO(3) (which yields
their time dependence so naturally and so generally) is
not particularly suited for the study of the probability
density of Rydberg electrons in real space.

In general, the classical object which corresponds to
a coherent state is the classical phase space point which
labels the state itself [17, 18]. A point in phase space is
equivalent to a trajectory of the electron, which in the
case of the Coulomb potential is a Kepler ellipse. There-
fore the classical counterpart to the motion of the coher-
ent states of SO(4) is the dynamics of classical ellipses
in weak ﬁelds, which is the object of study in classical
perturbation theory, where the ellipse becomes the dy-
namical object itself [5, 25–27] .

In classical perturbation theory it is assumed that the
electron still moves along an unperturbed ellipse, and
the equations of motion describe how the elements (in
the sense of celestial mechanics [28]) of the ellipse slowly
vary in time. Clearly, an ellipse can be described by sev-
eral equivalent sets of elements, however, if one chooses
the angular momentum L and the Runge-Lenz vector a
(the magnitude of the latter being proportional to the ec-
centricity of the ellipse) the equations of motion turn out
to be particularly simple. More formally, in classical me-
chanics the angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz vec-
tor are constants of motion for the pure Kepler problem,
i.e., their Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian vanish,
just like the commutators of the corresponding quantum

(16)

(17)

operators. However, L and a become time-dependent as
soon as applied external ﬁelds break the SO(4) symmetry
of the Hamiltonian. In the case of very weak ﬁelds the ef-
fects of the perturbation take place on a time scale much
longer than the Kepler period TK = 2πn3. By simply av-
eraging the equations of motion over a Kepler period and
along an unperturbed Kepler ellipse one can easily derive
the dynamics for the time-averaged angular momentum
and the time-averaged Runge-Lenz vector, which for the
sake of simplicity we still indicate with L and a, and one
has [5, 25–27]:

where the two frequencies are the same as in Eq. (10).
The two classical spin vectors J1 and J2 simply precess
clockwise around the “magnetic ﬁelds” ω1 and ω2, just
like their quantum counterparts.

This shows that elliptic states in weak ﬁelds not only
do evolve into elliptic states, and therefore retain their co-
herence properties and their localization along a classical
Kepler ellipse, but they also evolve exactly according to
the laws of classical mechanics (in the perturbative limit).
This result has been already observed numerically and
discussed theoretically for special ﬁelds conﬁgurations in
Refs. [29, 30], and also in Ref. [23], where the case of or-
thogonal electric and magnetic ﬁelds is discussed. Most
importantly, the same result has been observed also ex-
perimentally [7].

Indeed, we have illustrated explicitly the connection
between quantum and classical mechanics only for a spe-
cial conﬁguration of the ﬁelds. However, our approach is
based on the dynamics of the coherent states of SO(4)
and that guarantees -see below- that our conclusions hold
for arbitrary ﬁelds (within the constraints of perturba-
tion theory). Therefore, our study provides an analytical
explanation of the numerical results and it also general-
izes the previous theoretical arguments [23, 29, 30]. The
main conclusions of our analysis do not depend on the
particular choice of external ﬁelds; instead, they rest on
the equivalence between the intramanifold dynamics of a
Rydberg electron in weak external ﬁelds, and the motion
of two uncoupled spins in external magnetic ﬁelds, and
also on the properties of the coherent states of the angu-
lar momentum. It is well known that the coherent states
of SO(3) in arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds evolve in time ex-
actly like the corresponding classical spin vectors [17, 18],

and that is the reason why our demonstration holds for
arbitrary electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Although the ar-
guments for the classical evolution of quantum elliptic
states hold in general, for ﬁelds with complicated time-
dependence the explicit form of the propagator may be
diﬃcult to derive analytically. However, it is easy to see
that it must be given by some combination of rotation
operators. It is easy to see that in general the Euler an-
gles of the propagator for a spin in a magnetic ﬁeld obey
some complicated, nonlinear diﬀerential equations that
must be solved numerically, when the time dependence
of the ﬁeld is not trivial [17, 18]. However, when a nu-
merical treatment is necessary, it is clearly much simpler
to solve the classical, linear Eqs. (17). In fact, the classi-
cal equations yield directly the unit vectors n′
2,
which label and determine completely the coherent state
after it has evolved in time.

1 and n′

The quantum propagator of Eq. (13) is just the so-
lution for a very special conﬁguration of the external
ﬁelds, however it is very useful because of its illustrative
character, and of its relevance to ion-Rydberg collisions,
which have been investigated experimentally. Moreover,
for such ﬁelds the classical dynamics of the unit vectors
labeling the elliptic state becomes amenable to an exact
analytical treatment and it yields a most intuitive un-
derstanding of the dynamics, and we exploit this ﬁnal
characteristic in the next section.

A slowly rotating electric ﬁeld is equivalent to crossed
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the noninertial frame ro-
tating with the ﬁeld [5, 14, 24]. Therefore our analysis ex-
plains why calculations based on purely classical methods
account so well for several experimental results, ranging
from slow ion-Rydberg collisions [4–6] to the dynamics
of circular states in circularly polarized ﬁelds [7, 9], and
to the anomalous scaling of the autoionization lifetimes
of alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms also in circularly polar-
ized microwave ﬁelds [8, 10]. Indeed, a classical trajectory
(17) is almost
Monte Carlo simulation based on Eqs.
equivalent to a quantum treatment, in which the initial
state is represented as a superposition of coherent states
of SO(4). That is, an elliptic state which is localized
along a classical ellipse follows that same ellipse during
its time evolution. Clearly, the quantum state is always
somewhat diﬀuse, which is not true for a classical or-
bit. On the other hand, the overlap between two elliptic
states with diﬀerent angular momentum and Runge-Lenz
vector is [17, 18]:

geometric interpretation, as we illustrate more clearly in
the next section.

III. EXCITATION OF CIRCULAR STATES

As a ﬁrst application, in this section we describe an
alternative method for the excitation of circular states,
that is, hydrogenic states of maximum angular momen-
tum.

Several diverse techniques have already been proposed
and successfully implemented for the excitation of cir-
cular states and more generally of large-L elliptic states
[31–35]. However, all these methods are based on the adi-
abatic manipulation of the Rydberg electron wave func-
tion. First, the electron is excited to an eigenstate of the

Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom in weak ﬁelds, and
next the external ﬁelds are slowly varied in time while the
electron always remains adiabatically in the same eigen-
state of the Hamiltonian. Therefore in all such techniques
the time scale that deﬁnes the adiabatic regime is deter-
mined by the inverse of the spacing of the energy levels of
the hydrogen atom in weak ﬁelds. In practice, this means
that a transformation is “adiabatic” if it takes place dur-
ing a time much longer than the Stark or Larmor period
of the Rydberg electron.

However, ground state electrons are typically excited
to high-n Rydberg states via a few optical transitions,
and initially they are conﬁned to low angular momen-
tum states. This causes some problems, because low-l
Rydberg electrons are strongly coupled to the atomic (or
molecular) core, which enhances the probability of de-
caying out of the Rydberg state. To the end of stabi-
lizing the Rydberg electron it is then useful to increase
the angular momentum of the state as quickly as possi-
ble [36]. We propose a technique which is adiabatic with
respect of the Kepler period of the electron, which is a
much shorter time than the Stark or Larmor periods (by
a factor
1/n). In fact, we do not try to maintain the
electron in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian at all times,
and we only require that the dynamics must be conﬁned
within a hydrogenic n-manifold.

∼

Our approach is based on the dynamics of elliptic
states in weak external ﬁelds (a method based on the
same dynamics was suggested in Refs. [23, 29]), and be-
cause we have shown that the evolution of these states is
purely classical, we can discuss the excitation of circular
states using classical mechanics. For a hydrogen atom in
an electric ﬁeld the red and blue Stark states with m = 0
(m being the usual magnetic quantum number) are two
limit cases of elliptic states [19–23]. They correspond to
two classical ellipses with maximum eccentricity, which
have collapsed to a straight line. Individual high-n Stark
states can be accessed directly from low energy states via
an optical transition, and we assume that the Rydberg
electron is initially placed in the blue Stark state, with
m = 0 (the same derivation applies also to electrons ini-
tially in the red Stark state). The ﬁelds conﬁguration
under which the Stark state evolves into a circular state
could be derived analyzing the classical propagator of
Eq. (22), however we present a more intuitive interpre-
tation of the dynamics, which is based on a geometrical
description of the time evolution.

The external Stark ﬁeld points along the positive z
axis, and so does the Runge-Lenz vector of the blue Stark
state, which means that the two angular momenta J1
and J2 point respectively along the +z and
z axis (see
Fig. 2). Clearly, the angular momentum L of the state
vanishes, as it must for an extreme Stark state. Our goal
is to maximize L, and therefore we need a conﬁguration of
external ﬁelds which will align J1 and J2 so to maximize
their sum (L = J1 + J2) and minimize their diﬀerence
(a = J1
J2). We construct such ﬁelds by rotating
the Stark ﬁeld counterclockwise (recall that a rotating

−

−

electric ﬁeld is equivalent to crossed electric and magnetic
ﬁelds [5, 14, 24]) around the y axis, and we also vary in
time both the magnitude of the ﬁeld and its rotation
frequency, that is:

z and x axis, and ωR(t) is the time dependent rotation
frequency. We also set some ﬁnal time τ , which must
be long compared to the Kepler period to insure that the
motion is conﬁned within an n-manifold. We require that
at such time τ the ﬁeld vanishes, so that the evolution of
the elliptic state halts exactly when it becomes a circular
state, that is,

F (τ ) = 0 .

(26)

In other words, as we slowly rotate the Stark ﬁeld we also
slowly turn it oﬀ.

The eﬀect of the ﬁeld of Eq. (25) is best analyzed in
a frame rotating with the ﬁeld. A rotating frame is not
a Galilean frame, and the inertial eﬀects of the Coriolis
forces can be described exactly by introducing an eﬀec-
tive Larmor frequency equal to the rotation frequency
ωR of the frame of reference [5, 14, 24]. Therefore the
equations of motion in the rotating frame are

(27)

where ωR and ωS point respectively along the y and z
axis. We then require that at all times

ωR(t) = ωS(t) ,

(28)

so that the axes of precession for J1 and J2 have con-
stant orientation in space. The axes of precession have
constant orientation in space also when the two frequen-
cies are simply proportional to each other, but the anal-
ysis of the dynamics is much simpler when the Stark and
rotation frequencies are exactly equal.

As we argued before, the two spin vectors precess

around the two following “magnetic ﬁelds”:

ω1 = ωR + ωS
ω2 = ωR

ωS ,

−

(29)

where ω1 and ω2 lie in the yz plane, and ω1 bisects the
angle between the +y and +z axes, whereas ω2 bisects
the angle between the +y and

z axes.

It is easy to see from Fig. 2 that a clockwise precession
of J1 around ω1 by an angle φ = π (or any odd integer
multiple of π) overlaps that spin vector with the +y axis.

−

Similarly, a clockwise precession by the same angle and
around ω2 aligns J2 along the +y axis. The net result of
the time evolution is to align the two vectors with one an-
other exactly, and so the blue Stark state evolves into the
desired circular state, with angular momentum pointing
along the +y axis. Therefore, we impose a ﬁnal con-
straint on the total angle of precession, which translates
to a condition on the magnitude of the Stark frequency
of the external ﬁeld:

τ

0 q

S(t) + ω2
ω2

R(t)dt = √2

ωS(t)dt = (2p + 1)π ,

(30)

τ

where p is some integer. Equation (30) also means
that the total angle of rotation of the electric ﬁeld is
(2p + 1)π/√2, which concludes our prescription for the
excitation of circular states.

FIG. 2. Dynamics in the rotating frame of the classical
spin vectors J1 and J2 in an external ﬁeld which satisﬁes the
requirements described in the text, with p = 0. At time t = 0
the two vectors point respectively along the +z and −z axis,
which maximizes their diﬀerence, i.e. the Runge-Lenz vector,
as it must be for the initial blue Stark state. Next, they
precess clockwise respectively around the two axes ω1 and
ω2 (which lie in the yz plane), and at the ﬁnal time τ both
vectors are aligned along the y axis. This means that the
state has maximum angular momentum, and it is the desired
circular state. The dashed curved lines show the trajectories
described by the tips of J1 and J2, while the dashed straight
lines represent the same vectors at some intermediate times.
From the point of view shown in the ﬁgure, J1 precess behind
its axis of rotation ω1, whereas J2 passes in front of ω2.

Finally, note that our analysis does not impose any
constraint on “how” the ﬁeld is switched oﬀ. The only
constraint is on the total angle of precession, and the
functional form of the time dependence of the ﬁeld am-
plitude may be chosen in the experimentally most con-

6

venient way [36].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown that the dynamics of
quantum elliptic states in weak external ﬁelds is de-
scribed exactly by classical perturbation theory. There-
fore, the problem of evaluating a complicated quantum
propagator is reduced to the solution of the simple, linear
equations of motion of the classical system. Clearly, in
the case of ﬁelds with complicated time-dependence, one
may have to solve the classical equations numerically, but
that is still a relatively simple task. Moreover, our work
explains previous merely numerical observations connec-
it also
tion between classical and quantum dynamics;
generalizes to arbitrary ﬁelds some theoretical arguments
which were limited to some special conﬁgurations of the
ﬁelds [23, 29, 30].
Indeed, because of the properties of
the coherent states of SO(4) [17, 18], our demonstration
of the classical evolution of elliptic states in weak ﬁelds
holds for arbitrary ﬁelds (although in this paper we did
not solve such case analytically). That is why our anal-
ysis provides a solid theoretical explanation for the sur-
prising agreement between calculations based on classi-
cal mechanics [5, 6, 9, 10] and several experimental results
[4, 7, 8]. It also indicates that it would be appropriate to
use perturbative, classical methods to analyze the dy-
namics of Rydberg electrons in the complicated, time
dependent ﬁelds that are expected under realistic ZEKE
conditions [36].

Atomic elliptic states “sit” on classical Kepler ellipses,
and in a sense they sew the wave ﬂesh on the classical
bones [37] made of periodic orbits. Indeed, as the clas-
sical orbits slowly evolve in time under the perturbation
due to external weak ﬁelds, elliptic states follow exactly
the same dynamics, and remain conﬁned along the very
same ellipse throughout its motion. Clearly, the argu-
ment can also be stated the other way around, and one
may prefer to say that it is the classical orbit which is
following the more fundamental quantum state. Be it as
it may, note that in the theory of atomic elliptic states
there is no semiclassical approximation, and the corre-
spondence with classical mechanics is made directly from
the purely quantum domain.

More technically, the dynamical equivalence between
the motion of quantum elliptic states and the time-
averaged dynamics of classical orbits relies on the proper-
ties of the coherent states of SO(4), and on the fact that
the external perturbations can be expressed in terms of
the generators of the group. Our work then opens the
question of the generality of our results. That is:
is
the present example of quantum-classical equivalence a
special property of the Hydrogen atom only, or can it
be extended to a wider class of weakly perturbed inte-
grable systems? This is a fundamental problem in mod-
ern physics, as it has been shown in the last few decades

by the amount of research on the quantum-to-classical
transition in nonintegrable systems [3].

Finally, we have proposed an alternative, fast method
for the production of ultrastable circular Rydberg states,
which is based on the dynamics of atomic elliptic states.
In our derivation we make use of the exact quantum
propagator for the purely hydrogenic Hamiltonian, which
is only an approximation to the case of more complex
atoms. There, it is to be expected that the eﬃcacy of
the method may be partially spoiled by complex core ef-
fects. It is likely that these eﬀects are of minor magnitude
and that they can be compensated by a slight modiﬁca-
tion of the electric ﬁeld, or by the introduction of some
magnetic ﬁeld. Our prescription provides then a starting
point for the search of the most eﬀective ﬁelds conﬁgu-
ration, which can be reasonably expected to be “in the
neighborhood” of the hydrogenic solution, and the tools
of optimal control theory can in principle be used to im-
prove the eﬃciency of the method. Further research in
this area is currently in progress in our group.

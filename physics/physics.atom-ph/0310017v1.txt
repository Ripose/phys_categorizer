We report optical absorption imaging of ultracold neutral plasmas. Images are used to measure the
ion absorption spectrum, which is Doppler-broadened. Through the spectral width, we monitor ion
equilibration in the ﬁrst 250 ns after plasma formation. The equilibration leaves ions on the border
between the weakly coupled gaseous and strongly coupled liquid states. On a longer timescale of
microseconds, we observe radial acceleration of ions resulting from pressure exerted by the trapped
electron gas.

Plasma physics traditionally studies systems with tem-
peratures of thousands of kelvin or greater because col-
lisional ionization of atoms requires kinetic energies on
this scale. Ultracold neutral plasmas, created by pho-
toionizing laser-cooled and trapped atoms, access an ex-
otic regime in which particle energies can be on the order
of 1 K.

Fundamental

interest in ultracold neutral plasmas
stems from a range of phenomena in the ultracold regime.
Recent experiments have studied plasma creation [1], col-
lective modes [2], and recombination into highly excited
Rydberg atomic states [3]. The spontaneous evolution
of a dense, ultracold gas of Rydberg atoms into an ul-
tracold plasma has also been investigated [4]. This is
part of a search in atomic clouds for an analog of the
Mott insulator-conductor transition in condensed mat-
ter [5]. Recombination in these systems resembles the
methods used to produce cold antihydrogen with trapped
positrons and antiprotons [6, 7].

A series of theory papers [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] explored is-
sues surrounding thermalization and recombination in ul-
tracold neutral plasmas when both electrons and ions are
near or in the strongly coupled regime [13]. In strongly
coupled plasmas the electrical interaction energy between
the charged particles exceeds the average kinetic energy.
This reverses the traditional energy hierarchy that un-
derlies our normal understanding of plasmas based on
concepts such as Debye screening and hydrodynamics.
Strongly coupled plasmas exist in dense astrophysical
systems [14], matter irradiated with intense laser ﬁelds
[15, 16], dusty plasmas of highly charged macroscopic
particles [17], and non-neutral trapped ion plasmas [18]
that are laser cooled until they freeze into Wigner crys-
tals.

We now report the ﬁrst results with a new probe of
ultracold plasmas: absorption imaging. This technique
provides in situ, non destructive measurements, and of-
fers excellent spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution.
We describe the use of this probe to study ion-ion equili-
bration and expansion of the plasma during the ﬁrst few
microseconds after photoionization, but we emphasize its
great potential to study a host of phenomena such as ion
collective modes [19], shock waves [11], recombination,
and particle-particle spatial correlations [18].

FIG. 1: Atomic and ionic energy levels involved in the exper-
iment, with decay rates. (A) Neutral atoms are laser cooled
and trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on
the 1S0 − 1P1 transition at 461 nm. Atoms excited to the 1P1
level by the MOT lasers are ionized by photons from a laser
at ∼ 412 nm. (B) Ions are imaged using the 2S1/2 − 2P1/2
transition at 422 nm. 2P1/2 ions decay to the 2D3/2 state 7%
of the time, after which they cease to interact with the imag-
ing beam. This does not complicate the experiment because
ions typically scatter fewer than one photon during the time
the imaging beam is on.

To form the plasma, the MOT magnets are turned oﬀ
and atoms are ionized with photons from a 10 ns pulsed
dye laser whose wavelength is tuned just above the ioniza-
tion continuum (Fig. 1A). Because of the small electron-
to-ion mass ratio, the initial electron kinetic energy (Ee)
approximately equals the diﬀerence between the photon
energy and the ionization potential. Ee/kB can be as
100
low as the bandwidth of the ionizing laser, which is
mK. The initial kinetic energy for the resulting singly-
charged, electronic ground state ions is close to that of
the original neutral atoms. As we will discuss below, the
resulting non-equilibrium plasma evolves rapidly. Up to
1% of the neutral atoms are ionized producing plas-
12
mas with a peak density of (5

109 cm−3.

The production of an ultracold neutral plasma starts
with atoms that are cooled and conﬁned in a magneto-

Immediately after photoionization, the charge distri-
bution is neutral everywhere. Due to the kinetic en-

2

performed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the im-
ages.

To study the time-evolution of the plasma, we vary
the delay between the formation of the plasma and im-
age exposure (tdelay) with 10 ns accuracy. The minimum
camera exposure gate width is 50 ns. For the shortest
exposure times, which we use for the best time resolu-
tion at very short tdelay, we typically average about 60
ionizing laser shots. For longer delay times we use longer
image exposure times of up to 800 ns, and decrease the
number of accumulations to keep the total number of
photons detected approximately constant. The repeti-
tion rate for ionization and image recording is about 5
times per second.

The imaging beam itself can also be gated with a min-
imum width of about 200 ns. We use this capability for
tdelay > 1 µs to turn oﬀ the image beam until the camera
exposure begins. This prevents optical pumping of the
ions to the 2D3/2 state (Fig. 1B).

Plotting the peak optical depth as a function of im-
age laser frequency provides the absorption spectrum of
the ions (Fig. 3). The imaging laser linewidth of about
5 MHz is negligible on the scale of the 21.5 MHz natural
linewidth of the transition. As described below, addi-
tional broadening of the absorption spectrum provides a
wealth of information on the plasma dynamics.

the timescale of the inverse electron plasma frequency
τe = ω−1
meε0/nee2 < 1 ns, where me, ne, and
e are the electron mass, density and charge. On this
timescale the ions are essentially immobile. The result-
ing local charge imbalance creates a Coulomb potential
energy well that traps all but a small fraction (< 5%)
of the electrons. Simulations [1] show that electrons es-
cape mostly from the edges of the spatial distribution,
and the center of the cloud is well described as a neutral
plasma [21]. The diagnostic used in previous experiments
was charged particle detection of electrons and ions after
they had left the plasma.

Spectroscopic diagnostics are ubiquitous in plasma
experiments, and some even provide spatial
informa-
tion, such as spatially resolved laser induced ﬂuorescence
[18, 22]. The absorption imaging reported here is par-
ticularly well-adapted for small, cold, relatively dilute
plasmas that evolve very quickly. It is also a powerful
technique for studying laser cooled and trapped neutral
atoms [23]. A collimated laser beam, tuned near reso-
nance with the principle transition in the ions (Fig. 1B),
illuminates the plasma and falls on an image intensiﬁed
CCD camera. Following Beer’s law, the optical depth
(OD) is deﬁned in terms of the image intensity without
(Ibackground) and with (Iplasma) the plasma present,

which is much less than the saturation intensity of the

Error bars are two sigma uncertainties from Voigt proﬁle ﬁts
to absorption spectra. The time after photoionization corre-
sponds to the timing of the center of the camera exposure
gate. Data show disorder-induced heating of the ions as the
ions equilibrate during tdelay < 250 ns.

Here, a = (4πn0e/3)−1/3 is the Wigner-Seitz radius,
and Te = 2
3 Ee/kB is the electron temperature as set by
the wavelength of the ionizing laser. For this sample
Γe = 0.1.

The observed spectral linewidths are all signiﬁcantly
broader than the natural linewidth of the transition. Col-
lisional broadening is not signiﬁcant because of the rela-
tively low particle density and collision frequency in the
sample. The dominant contribution to the linewidth is
Doppler broadening, which makes the spectrum a very
accurate probe of the ion velocity distribution. From the
ﬁt of each spectrum to a Voigt proﬁle, we extract the

rms Doppler broadening, σD =

the ion mass, and λ is the wavelength of the transition.
This allows us to determine an ion temperature (Ti) as a
function of time, as shown in Fig. 4.

The temperature increases rapidly for tdelay < 250 ns.
Two pieces of information imply that this is thermal-
ization of ions with themselves after creation in a spa-
tially disordered state. The timescale is on the order

ions respond to perturbations from their equilibrium spa-
tial distribution. The temperature of 1.4
0.1 K derived
from the Doppler width at 250 ns is also on the order
of the amount of potential energy inherent in the initial
disorder of the ions. A simple estimate implies there is
5 K of potential energy that will be redis-

This thermalization has been modelled with molecu-

lar dynamics simulations [8, 9, 10], and the experimental
data is in general agreement with the theory. The accu-
racy of the imaging probe will enable detailed comparison
of measurement and theory for the time dependence of
the ion temperature.

The ﬁnal temperature reached, however, can be com-
pared with an expression derived in [8]. Assuming com-

We now address the level of Coulomb coupling for the
ions. From the temperature and peak density we derive
Γi = 3
1 for the thermalized ion cloud at tdelay = 250 ns.
For a system of charges embedded in a uniform neutraliz-
ing background, formally called a one-component plasma
[26], local spatial correlations characteristic of a strongly
coupled ﬂuid appear for Γ
2. For Debye shielded parti-
≥
cles, such as the ions studied here, screening will reduce
the correlations. This eﬀect is approximately incorpo-
rated by using the eﬀective coupling constant Γ∗ = Γe−κ
[9, 24]. At 250 ns, Γ∗
1, and the ions are just
on the edge of the strongly coupled ﬂuid phase. Perhaps
other initial experimental parameters, or laser cooling of
the ions [9, 27], will lead to more strongly coupled sys-
tems, although Γ∗
i = 2 already puts the experiment in an
interesting regime.

For tdelay > 250 ns, the spectral width continues to
increase, but at a slower rate, as shown in the inset of
Fig. 4. This slow increase is due to outward radial accel-
eration of the ions caused by pressure exerted by the gas
of trapped electrons. This was studied experimentally in
[2] and theoretically by a variety of means in [11]. The
experiments measured the ﬁnal velocity that the ions ac-
quired, which was approximately
Ee/mi. Here we ob-
serve the ion dynamics at much earlier times during the
acceleration phase.

rms size (σi) as the mean of the observed sizes σx and
σy, and we assume thermal equilibrium for the electrons
throughout the cloud [11]. This force leads to a radial
expansion velocity for the ions, vr(r), which is correlated
with position and increases linearly with time. This does
not represent an increase in the random thermal veloc-
ity spread or temperature of the ions. Due to the large
mass diﬀerence, thermalization of ions and electrons [9]
is slow and occurs on a millisecond timescale. The in-
crease in Doppler broadening due to thermalization is
approximately one order of magnitude smaller than what
is observed.

Using the dynamics implied by Eq. 3, the evolution
of the Doppler broadening can be calculated. The mean

rately.

The ion acceleration is thus an excellent diagnostic of
the electron temperature. This will be of great value
in future studies because the temperature is predicted
to evolve in a complicated fashion for lower initial Γe
due to recombination and disorder-induced heating of the
electrons [9, 10, 11, 12]. One also expects that there
will be a cooling eﬀect at longer tdelay due to expansion
of the plasma and evaporative cooling [11]. The small

discrepancy between theory and data for long tdelay in
Fig. 4 may indicate the onset of this cooling, although
expansion of the plasma is small on the timescale of these
observations. For the maximum tdelay and typical vr ≈
50 µm. This small increase in size is
15 m/s, vrtdelay ≈
observed in the images (Fig. 2).

The initial study using absorption imaging of an ul-
tracold neutral plasma has probed ion dynamics in the
ﬁrst few microseconds after photoionization. It revealed
disorder-induced heating that was predicted in [8], and
showed that the ions equilibrate on the boundary of the
gas-liquid transition. Acceleration of ions due to electron
pressure was also evident, and can be used to monitor the
electron temperature.

Many future experiments suggest themselves. Some
of the most interesting are investigating dynamics when
the initial electron Coulomb coupling parameter is large
and recombination and disorder-induced electron heating
are expected to dominate the plasma evolution. Detailed
study of ion and electron thermalization at the border
of the strongly coupled regime is also possible. Improve-
ments in the imaging optics will signiﬁcantly increase the
image signal-to-noise ratio and allow study of features on
10 µm experimental
the ion density distribution with
resolution.

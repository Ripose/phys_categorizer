We make a detailed analysis of each possible spin-orbit coupling of zincblende narrow-gap cylin-
drical quantum dots built in a two-dimensional electron gas. These couplings are related to both
bulk (Dresselhaus) and structure (Rashba) inversion asymmetries. We study the competition be-
tween electron-electron and spin-orbit interactions on electronic properties of 2-electron quantum
dots.

PACS numbers: 71.70.Ej, 73.21.La, 78.30.Fs
Keywords: spin-orbit coupling, Rashba eﬀect, quantum dots

The creation and manipulation of spin populations in semiconductors has received great attention since the Datta-
Das proposal of a spin ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor,1 based on Rashba spin-orbit coupling of electrons in a bidimensional
electron gas,2 and the possibility for quantum computation devices using quantum dots (QDs).3 Thus, it is important
that every spin-orbit (SO) eﬀect be clearly understood for a full control of spin-ﬂip mechanisms in nanostructures.

There are two main SO contributions in zincblende materials. In addition to the structure inversion asymmetry
(SIA) caused by the 2D conﬁnement (the Rashba SO), there is a bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) term in those
structures (the Dresselhaus SO).4 An yet additional lateral conﬁnement deﬁning a dot introduces another SIA term
with important consequences, as we will see in detail. Although the relative importance of these two eﬀects depends
on the material and on sample design (via interfacial ﬁelds), only recently have authors begun to consider the behavior
of spins under the inﬂuence of all eﬀects.

The goal of this work is to show how important diﬀerent types of SO couplings are on the spectra of parabolic
QDs built with narrow-gap zincblende materials. We consider both Rashba and a diagonal SIA, as well as the all
Dresselhaus BIA terms in the Hamiltonian, in order to study features of the spectrum as function of magnetic ﬁeld,
dot size, and electron-electron interaction.

Figure 1 shows the simultaneous addition of both SIA terms, H D

SIA causes
small splittings on the zero-ﬁeld spectrum and readjust the sequence of states according to total angular momentum
j = l + σZ /2. For example, the highest (lowest) zero-ﬁeld energy level in the second shell has j = 3/2 (j = 1/2). Since

with an energy minigap. Higher energy levels, also satisfying this selection rule, present ACs around the same value
2.5 T, shown in Panels C
of BC , and gives origin to the observed collapse in both σZ and l quantum numbers at B
and D. The range of critical ﬁelds (between 2.1 and 2.6 T), and the size of the minigaps opened at those AC regions,
are proportional to the magnitude of α. HR also induces small splittings in the zero-ﬁeld spectrum and slightly shifts
the accidental degeneracy points at ﬁnite ﬁelds. After adding both SIA terms simultaneously (full spectrum in Panel
A), one can see in the inset of Panel B that the ordering of states is the one determined by H D
SIA. However, the
energies of states j = 3/2 at 30 meV and j = 1/2 at a slightly smaller value, as well as the value of ﬁeld (B & 0.1

. The width of critical ﬁelds becomes wider, between 2.2 and 3.6 T, as seen in Panel C. Furthermore, Panel
{
D shows that orbitals having l < 0 (l > 0) present ACs at ﬁelds smaller (larger) than the ﬁeld BC ≃
2.55 T where
occurred the ﬁrst AC (see insets of Panels C and D). For a future comparison notice, in Panel B, that the ﬁrst AC
occurs at that same BC value. In general, ACs between
near 50 meV involving n = 1 states
states with any n value occur inside the same unique range of critical ﬁelds, as shown in Panels C and D. Finally,
observe that both SIA terms can be reduced by decreasing ω0 (H D
SIA) or dV /dz (HR), and that all even and negative
l states (l =

8) show anticrossings.
Figure 2 shows the simultaneous addition of both BIA terms, H C

the present QD parameters, has small inﬂuence over the H0 spectrum. Small state mixtures is induced at B0 ≃

spectrum and also a shift due to matrix elements for ∆l =

±
at the ACs regions are very small. Therefore, the simultaneous addition of both BIA terms (full spectrum in Panel
A), where the linear term H L
D is the most important, drastically changes the general features of the FD spectrum,
inducing strong zero-ﬁeld splittings and shifting its accidental degeneracies to higher ﬁelds. Yet, the respective matrix
1 = ∆σZ /2) does not introduce ACs on the lowest energy levels. As seen in Panels C and D, the
elements (∆l =
mixing induced by the linear term is so strong that the QD states are not anymore pure states even at zero ﬁeld.
Notice in Panel C that at B = 0 values of

0.7 for the ground state. As an example of level crossings displaced to higher ﬁelds, observe in Panel B that
3.3 T, there is only one crossing present in the second shell at about 0.45 T (see
the ﬁrst one has moved to BC ≃
inset), and the second one occurs a higher ﬁeld around 3.5 T. Thus, contrary to the observed for SIA case, the normal
ordering of state is no longer restored. We will come back to this fact later. As a ﬁnal note, in the same inset and
at zero ﬁeld, the highest (lowest) energy state has j = 3/2 with eigenvalue equal to energy of 30 meV of the pure H0
(j = 1/2 at smaller energy near 27 meV). The inﬂuence of H L

D on the spectrum changes with z0.

In Fig. 4 we simulate the cancellation of zero-ﬁeld splittings even in the presence of all SO terms, what is reasonably
obtained by taking an interfacial ﬁeld dV /dz four times stronger than that one considered before (see Ref.[7], other
parameters remained unchanged). This is equivalent to increase the inﬂuence of the Rashba term HR. Notice,

FIG. 3: Spectrum of full H, where HR induces minigap regions that are shifted to higher ﬁelds by H L
but induces state mixtures. The zero-ﬁeld splittings produced by H D

D. H C
SIA are dominated by those from H L
D.

D has small inﬂuence

in Panels A and B, that not only the zero-ﬁeld splittings are nearly vanished, but also the Zeeman splittings are
practically suppressed at low ﬁelds (B0 . 1.5 T). At zero magnetic ﬁeld, an energy shell structure identical to the
pure H0 and with the same level separation of 15 meV is formed at displaced energies. In the inset of Panel B one
sees that the energy of j = 3/2 level is pushed near j = 1/2 level, going from 30 (in Fig.3 B) to 26.5 meV (in Fig.4 B).
While the zero-ﬁeld splittings nearly vanish the energy minigaps increases, as seen in Panel B. The rearrangement
of electronic levels is so remarkable that ACs related to the cubic BIA term at 1.2 T become visible (Panel B and
and
insets of Panels C and D). The minigaps at 33 (44) meV involves states
). Even though the electronic levels are less disperse here than in Fig. 3, the SO-induced state mixture is

FIG. 4: Full H spectrum with four times stronger dV /dz. Notice the cancellation of zero-ﬁeld and Zeeman splittings at low
ﬁelds (A, B and inset). New ACs due to H C
D selection rules occur near 1.2 T (B and insets in C and D). The lowest AC is
shifted back to BC = 2.7 T. Notice the enormous state mixture in C and, at zero ﬁeld, most states are displaying |σZ| < 0.5.

One can further appreciate the intricate balance between SO terms by analyzing how some quantities are aﬀected
by changes on the lateral and vertical sizes, l0 and z0, or on Rashba ﬁeld, dV /dz, as shown in Fig. 5. Curves with
squares, circles and triangles refer to a QD, respectively, with parameters of Ref. [7], with z0 doubled (smaller linear
BIA contribution) and with four times stronger dV /dz, while the dotted curve, in middle Panel, indicates the B0
C
ﬁeld where the ﬁrst FD level crossing occurs. The zero-ﬁeld splitting (left Panel) for states j = 3/2 and j = 1/2 of

the second shell is dominated by the linear BIA contribution for any value of l0. An increase on z0 strongly reduces
the splittings because the Dresselhaus contribution becomes weaker. The reduction is even more drastic by increasing
dV /dz, which makes HR larger and, thus, may cancel or suppress zero-ﬁeld splittings produced by H D

SIA.

Finally, the minigap opened at BC (right Panel) has their main origin in the HR term, while the inclusion of
HBIA causes a substantial reduction. If the value of z0 is doubled the splitting is enhanced slightly. A yet larger z0
produces no signiﬁcant changes. However, the splitting can be drastically enhanced by increasing the Rashba ﬁeld as,
for example, changing from 1 to 4.2 meV at l0 = 190 ˚A, when interfacial ﬁeld is increased four times. Measurement
of those three quantities should yield important information on the relative strength of SO parameters α and γ.

After having studied the one-particle QD problem we show, in Fig. 6, the two-electron QD spectrum under
magnetic ﬁeld (parameters in [7]). On the construction of Slater determinant for two-particle states we use the 20

Panel B shows the QD spectrum for full two-particle Hamiltonian, Hee + H. We may identify some similar features
to the single-particle case. For example, the linear Dresselhaus term almost destroys the energy shell structure at
zero ﬁeld by shifting level crossings and inducing new zero-ﬁeld splittings, while the Rashba term introduces energy
minigaps in the spectrum. Panel B shows details on the competition between Coulomb and spin-orbit interactions in
narrow-gap cylindrical dots. Observe that the SO interaction, at zero ﬁeld, acts against the direct Coulomb energy
and, in a sense, favoring the exchange term. For example: i) The ground state is shifted back from 35 to 31 meV,
which is close to the non-interacting value 30 meV; ii) The ﬁrst excited shell states have energies from 43 to 47 meV,
values even smaller than the non-interacting energy 45 meV. Other important feature in the ﬁrst excited shell is the
observation that the original triplet is broken on its three possible terms according to the projection of the total
angular momentum, MJ = ML + MS. For increasing energy order, these terms are composed, at zero ﬁeld, by the

A very special diﬀerence between the one- and two-particle problems is that a strong intrinsic (no phonon-assisted)
singlet-triplet transition (qubit) at low magnetic ﬁelds involving the ground state becomes possible in the two-electron
case and, in principle, could be explored in implementations of quantum computing devices. As mentioned, the
critical ﬁeld is decreased by QD occupation (from BC = 3.3 to B(2e)
C = 2.7 T), and this reduction may be increased
by decreasing the QD conﬁnement energy. At these critical ﬁelds where the intrinsic state mixture is enhanced, the
SO-induced spin relaxation rate (Γ) can be estimated from the minigap energy (∆), as Γ = ~/∆. For the lowest AC,
∆ values are taken from the right Panel of Fig. 5, from where one sees that ∆ is completely changeable by the QD
parameters and, consequently, the intrinsic rate Γ can be changed according to those parameters.

We showed that inclusion of all SO terms is essential in order to obtain a complete picture of the electronic
structure of narrow-gap QDs, and discussed the role played by each BIA and SIA terms on QD spectra and on spin
polarization of states. The combination of strong SO coupling in HR and large g-factor introduces strong intrinsic
mixtures and low excitations on the single-particle spectrum; the position of critical ﬁelds where minigaps occur is
aﬀected by H L
D. We observed that the two-particle spectrum exhibits strong singlet-triplet coupling involving QD
ground state at moderate ﬁelds, which may have signiﬁcant consequences like possible use in qubits designs.

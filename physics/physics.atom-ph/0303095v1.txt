Relativistic and QED energy shifts in positronium ion

M. Grigorescu and G. W. F. Drake

Department of Physics

Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Abstract: The leading relativistic and QED corrections to the ground
state energy of the three-body system e−e+e− are calculated numerically
using a Hylleraas correlated basis set. The accuracy of the nonrelativistic
variational ground state wave function is discussed with respect to the con-
vergence properties at the increase of the basis dimension and to the variance
of the energy expectation value. Recent progress in the numerical procedure
used to calculate expectation values for products of various physical opera-
tors is presented. It is shown that the nonrelativistic ground state energy
can be calculated with an accuracy below the level width. The corrections to
this energy include the lowest order Breit interaction, the vacuum polariza-
tion potential, one and two photon exchange contributions, the annihilation
interaction, and spin-spin contact terms. The relativistic eﬀects and the
residual interactions considered here decrease the one electron binding en-
ergy from the nonrelativistic value of 0.012 005 070 232 980 10(3) a.u. to
0.011 981 051 246(2) a.u..

I. Introduction

The positronium negative ion (Ps−) is the simplest system composed of
three equal mass fermions, e−e+e− , bounded only by electromagnetic inter-
actions. Similar examples of three-body systems, bounded by increasingly
complex interactions, are provided by three-quark systems such as the proton
and neutron, and three-nucleon systems, as the 3H, 3He nuclei.

In a nonrelativistic approach, accurate numerical approximations to the
bound eigenstates of three quantum particles interacting by Coulomb forces
can be obtained by using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method. A suitable
set of coordinates and basis states for the three-body problem was proposed
by Hylleraas [1] during the early days of quantum mechanics, and it was used
to calculate the ground state energy of the helium atom. With respect to this
set, the matrix elements of various two-body operators can be expressed in
analytical form [2], and extensive high-precision calculations become feasible
[3] [4].

The relativistic quantm many-body problem can be approached either
from the ﬁeld theory, or by using a Schr¨odinger equation with an ”action at
a distance” type Hamiltonian, deﬁned by quantizing the classical relativistic
system [5]. Though, a puzzling result in classical mechanics is the no inter-
action theorem [6], which apparently rules out any instantaneous action-at-
a-distance Hamiltonian. This theorem states that in a classical many-body
system, the relativistic invariance of the equations of motion (the physical
laws) is compatible with the ”manifest relativistic invariance”, of the world
lines determined by these equations, only if there is no interaction between
the particles. However, this strong result can be avoided if the interacting
particles have a structure, as the condition of manifest invariance becomes
ambiguous [7] [8].

The approach to the bound state problem based on ﬁeld theory leads to
a relativistically invariant Bethe-Salpeter equation [9], p. 196. In the case of
two relativistic electrons, approximate Lorentz invariance to the ﬁrst order
is introduced by the Breit interaction, which can be seen as the quantum
correspondent to the Darwin term in classical electromagnetism [10].

In the helium atom, the two electrons move in the Coulomb ﬁeld created
by a composite, heavy nucleus, which to a ﬁrst approximation can be consid-
ered as center of mass (CM). The case of Ps− is diﬀerent, because all three
particles are elementary, have the same mass, and move to the same degree

2

with respect to the CM.

The existence of a bound ground state in the e−e+e− system was pre-
dicted by Wheeler [11] and was observed by Mills [12] passing a positron
beam through a thin carbon ﬁlm in vacuum. The measured Ps−
(2γ)e−
decay rate λ = 2.09(9) nsec−1 [12] corresponds to a Ps− lifetime of 0.478
nsec, intermediate between that of para (singlet) Ps (0.125 nsec) and ortho
(triplet) Ps (140 nsec) [13].

→

Accurate nonrelativistic numerical calculations for the ground-state prop-
erties of Ps− are presented in refs.
[14] to [17]. The autoionization states
have been studied in [18], while several low-lying resonances have been pre-
dicted recently [19], by using a combination between the stochastic varia-
tional method (SVM) with correlated Gaussians and the complex scaling
method.

The accuracy of the Ps− groundstate wave functions given by SVM in
a Gaussian basis, was studied by comparison to the direct solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation in [16]. It was shown that despite the fact that in SVM
the convergence properties of the expectation values for most operators are
better, the wave function is less accurate.

In this work, the accuracy of the Ps− nonrelativistic variational ground
state is studied by using beside the convergence properties of the energy with
basis size, also the variance of the Hamiltonian. The numerical procedure
used to calculate matrix elements is presented in Sect. II. It is shown that in
agreement with [16], the variance is larger than the accuracy resulting from
convergence. Estimates of the relativistic correction terms and the leading
QED corrections are presented in Sect. III. Tables containing the expecta-
tion values of singular operators appearing in the correction terms, such as
p4 and delta functions are given in the Appendix. The main results and the
concluding remarks are summarized in Sect. IV.

in reduced atomic units of energy f a.u. (= 13.605 698 1(40) eV = 1Ry if
f = 0.5), where 1 a.u. = e2/a0 = α2mc2 is the atomic unit of energy and

Within QED the constituents of the three body-system e−e+e− cease to
be ”elementary”, because they are subject not only to the mutual two-body
Coulomb-Breit interaction, but are also coupled to the vacuum ﬂuctuations
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld ~A [21]. The interaction terms accounting for
this coupling are represented by an inﬁnite series of increasingly complicated
Feynman diagrams with closed photon lines. However, the complexity is
increased recursively, by taking into account at each order three basic pro-
cesses, represented by the anomalous magnetic moment (vertex) corrections,

electron self-mass and vacuum polarization diagrams.

Although formally complicated, the main eﬀect of the coupling to the
ﬁeld degrees of freedom is simply a change in the charge and mass param-
eters e and m of the theory. This contribution has already been taken into
account, because it is included in the measured values of e and m used to
deﬁne the atomic unit of energy. Though, the QED corrections in the inter-
acting three body-system e−e+e− are not the same as for the free particles,
and the diﬀerences still need to be considered.

The vacuum polarization properties have been studied ﬁrst by Heisen-
berg [22] and Uehling [23], showing that a given charge density ρ( ~R) induces
a polarization charge δρ( ~R) =
2ρ( ~R), where λ0 = ¯h/mc is the
(α/15π)λ2
Compton wavelength of the electron. The induced charge leads to deviations
from the standard Coulomb interaction. Thus, the vacuum behaves as an
inhomogeneous dielectric, in which the mutual potential energy between two
point-like charges Z1 and Z2 is [23]

As it was shown early by the Lamb shift measurements [24], the main

This expression shows that in a neutral two-body system (such as Ps) the
center of mass energy is not aﬀected by the ﬁeld only if ~A(R1) = ~A(R2), or
when the size of the system is negligible compared to the photon wavelength
(dipole approximation).

In a quantum N-body system it is convenient to take advantage of the
ﬁnite size eﬀects by writing ~A as the incoherent sum of long and short
wavelength components, ~AL and ~AS, obtained by decomposing
d3k as

Summarizing these results, the eﬀective QED contribution of order α3 to
the energy level En of Ps− due to the exchange of a transverse photon is
δ1pEn = δ1En + δ2En. This sum is independent of the arbitrary energy unit
RM , as it should, but for the purpose of numerical calculations we choose
RM = f Ry. With this choice, aµkR = α/2, and mc/(2¯hkR) = 1/(f α2).

IV. Summary and Conclusions

The calculation of the relativistic and QED corrections to the energy lev-
els of a quantum three-body system represents a challenging problem the
modern theory. Diﬃculties appear both at conceptual and computational
levels, as there is no satisfactory relativistic many-body quantum theory,
and the nonrelativistic problem is not integrable.

A quantum three-body system thoroughly investigated since the early
days of quantum mechanics is the helium atom. In this system a major sim-
pliﬁcation occurrs, because the reduced electron mass µ is smaller than the

16

10−4, and to a ﬁrst approx-
mass of the positive charge by a factor 1.3707
imation the relative motion of the nucleus in the center of mass frame can
be neglected. The relativistic invariance is partly restored by the Breit inter-
action, and highly accurate nonrelativistic wave functions can be obtained
numerically, from variational calculations. Within this framework, a pertur-
bative treatment of the relativistic and QED corrections gives energy levels
in remarkable agreement with experiment [3] [4].

×

The same procedure was applied in this work to the negative positronium
ion. However, by contrast to helium, all three particles have equall mass, and
a perturbative treatment of the positron motion becomes inappropriate.

The accuracy of the nonrelativistic energy and variational ground state
wave function was discussed in Sect. II. The eﬀective value of Eg estimated
0.262 005 070 232 980 107 69(28) a.u., the same as in [15], [17] and
here is
close within 10−8 to estimates obtained by other methods [16]. The variance
10−8
of the Hamiltonian for the largest (2528-dimensional) basis set is 2.78
10−8 a.u. due to the
a.u., smaller than the level width Γ = ¯hλ = 5.06
(2γ)e− decay.

The calculation of the ﬁrst relativistic and QED corrections has been
presented in Sect.
III. Formal expressions of these correction terms have
been known for a long time, but the mass polarization term, which cannot
be neglected for Ps−, increases dramatically the complexity of the numerical
calculations.
In this work the calculations have been performed by repre-
senting the action of the physical operators on the Hylleraas basis states in
terms of a suitable set of elementary operators (Appendix, Table I). The
numerical values obtained for some of the most important matrix elements
are summarized in the Tables II-V of the Appendix.
It was found that
the spin independent relativistic terms contribute to the Ps− ground state
0.072 738 092 198(4)α2 a.u. and the lowest order QED correc-
energy by
tions by 1.224 094 00(44)α3 a.u.. These terms decrease the ground state
energy to Eef f
0.262 008 467 959 9(4) a.u.. Both contributions decrease
slightly also the one electron binding energy, from the nonrelativistic value
0.012 005 070 232 980 10(3) a.u. to 0.012 004 708 462 43(3) a.u.. A much
larger contribution appears however from the spin-dependent contact terms,
which raise the ground state energy to Eef f
0.261 998 108 122(1) a.u.,
and further decrease the binding energy to 0.011 981 051 246(2) a.u.. The
calculated decay rate by two photon emission is 2.092 797(1) nsec−1, close to
the previous theoretical results and to the measured value [12].

The binding and ground state energies are shifted also by relativistic cor-
rections of order α3Ry containing spin-orbit magnetic interactions. These
contributions are also important, and should be included in the further at-
tempts to improve the accuracy of the present estimates.

tion, because Nr can be signiﬁcantly smaller than Np. For example, Np : Nr
is 20 : 18 in the case of ~

In the computer program the action of Ek consists of both arithmetic and
symbolic operations. The arithmetic operations are determined by its action
12e−αr1−βr2. The number nk of distinct polyno-
on the radial function ra
mial terms generated by this action is given in the second column of Table
I. The symbolic operation corresponds to the action of Ek on the spherical
l1l2
harmonics in
LM , and is coded by a character denoting angular operators
such as ˆr1 ·

(b) Error estimates

The series of numerical values presented in Tables II-V appear to be con-
vergent, but for comparison with experiment, it is useful to provide also a
single eﬀective value, representing the expected result of the present calcu-
lation when Nb → ∞
. The procedure adopted here to deﬁne this value
fn}
depends on the manner of convergence.
σf , given in
convergent as an alternating series, the eﬀective value fef f ±
the last row, was deﬁned as the arithmetic average of its last three con-
secutive terms, by fef f = (fnx + fny + fnz )/3, nx < ny < nz, and σ2
f =
[(fnx −
approaches the limit
by monotonous increase or decrease, then we can assume that the series can
be extended to inﬁnity by the function F (n) = fef f + Ae−γn. The matching
equations F (nx) = fnx, F (ny) = fny, F (nz) = fnz between F (n) and the last
three calculated numerical values yield the parameter fef f in the form [17]

Abstract

We report results of quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the ground state of dilute Fermi gases

with attractive short range two-body interactions. The strength of the interaction is varied to

study diﬀerent pairing regimes which are characterized by the product of the s-wave scattering

length and the Fermi wave vector, akF . We report results for the ground state energy, the pairing

gap ∆ and the quasiparticle spectrum. In the weak coupling regime, 1/akF < −1, we obtain BCS

superﬂuid and the energy gap ∆ is much smaller than the Fermi gas energy EF G. When a > 0, the
interaction is strong enough to form bound molecules with energy Emol. For 1/akF >

∼ 0.5 we ﬁnd

that weakly interacting composite bosons are formed in the superﬂuid gas with ∆ and gas energy

per particle approaching |Emol|/2.

In this region we seem to have Bose-Einstein condensation

(BEC) of molecules. The behavior of the energy and the gap in the BCS to BEC transition region,

−0.5 < 1/akF < 0.5 is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

How pairing evolves from the bare interaction has been a major question in condensed

matter physics, and the study of pairing in relation to the phenomenon of superﬂuidity and

superconductivity can be traced back to Cooper et al. [1]. Pairing lies at the core of several

quantum many-body problems, and it is also believed to inﬂuence the evolution of neutron

stars [2]. Here we report results of quantum Monte Carlo calculations of a superﬂuid Fermi

gas with short range two-body interactions. The strength of the interaction is varied to

study diﬀerent regimes of pairing.

The evolution of pairing with the strength of the interaction has been discussed in the

literature [3], [4].

In the regime where the interaction is weak and attractive, a gas of

fermions has a superconducting instability at low temperatures, and a gas of Cooper pairs is

formed. The typical coherence length is larger than the interparticle spacing r0 (4πr3

0ρ = 3

with ρ the number density) and the bound pairs overlap. In contrast, in the strong-coupling

limit the coherence length is small, and the bound pairs can be treated as well seperated

Bose molecules. One then expects the molecules to undergo Bose-Einstein condensation

(BEC) into a single quantum state with zero momentum.

The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer(BCS) theory [3] and Gorkov equations [5] have been used

to estimate gaps in superﬂuid gases. However, their predictions diﬀer by more than a factor

of two and they may be qualitatively valid only in the weakly interacting regime. Here we

use ﬁrst principle quantum Monte Carlo methods to study the entire region ranging from

free fermions to the tightly bound Bose molecules.

Dilute Fermi gases of 40K, 6Li, 2H for example, can now be studied in the laboratory using

magnetic and optical trapping and ingenious cooling methods [6], [7]. These are dilute Fermi

systems, in contrast to dense atomic liquid 3He or a solution of 3He in superﬂuid 4He. Within
the last few years temperatures T ≪ TF have been achieved, where TF = ¯h2k2
2m is the Fermi
kinetic energy and kF is the Fermi wave vector. At such a low temperature, the fermionic

F

nature of the quantum statistics becomes evident in the measurement of the density proﬁle of

2

the trapped gas. At even lower temperatures the transition to the superﬂuid Cooper-paired

state is expected. However, the temperature Tc of this transition can be much lower than TF

and conclusive evidence of superﬂuidity is still to be seen. In order to have the transition at

an achievable temperature, the experimentalists rely on the Feshbach resonance technique

to produce strong interaction between the fermionic atoms.

When the range of the interatomic interaction is smaller than all the length scales in

the system, the details of the interaction are believed to be unnecessary and the scattering

length a is suﬃcient to characterize it. Near the resonance, the magnitude of the scattering

length a becomes much larger than r0 and the system enters the strong-coupling regime.

The value akF ∼ −7.4 has been achieved by O’Hara et al. [7] and the limit (akF → −∞) is

now approached in the laboratory [8], [9]. Recently, creation of bosonic molecules from 40K

atoms was reported by Regal et al. [10], and pairing in the 1/akF ∼ 0 regime was observed

in Ref. [11].

A few words are in order regarding the language of s-wave scattering. For a noninteracting

system at zero temperature, the only length scale is 1/kF . We can use the dimensionless

quantity akF to describe a dilute gas having interparticle spacing r0 much greater than

the interaction range. We often use 1/akF because akF changes discontinuously from −∞

to +∞ when a bound state is formed at 1/akF = 0. For attractive interactions 1/akF can

change from large negative values (weakly interacting limit) to large positive values (strongly

interacting limit). As discussed in section II, the radius of the bound molecule provides an

other length scale in the strongly interacting regime. Some physical examples of the limits of

1/akF are: 1) electrons in superconductors have 1/akF large and negative; 2) neutron matter

has 1/akF small and negative; and 3) cold deuterium atoms have large positive 1/akF . In

the last case, molecular bound states smaller than the average interparticle distance r0 are
possible. On the other hand, superﬂuid 3He is not describable in terms of akF , because the

interaction range is greater than r0, and the paired state does not have s-wave symmetry.

In the limit of zero energy for the colliding pair, the two-body scattering cross section

σ is given by 4πa2. When |a| ≪ r0, the interatomic collisions in the gas are similar to
those in vacuum, and the mean free path is approximately given by ℓ = 1

σρ . However, this

3

approximation is meaningful only when |a| ≪ r0 and ℓ > r0. When |a| is >

∼ r0 the two-body
collisions in the gas are strongly inﬂuenced by the presence of other particles, and their cross

section in the gas is much smaller than in vacuum.

For a Fermi gas at low density, an expansion of the energy in terms of akF is possible.

For spin 1/2 Fermi gases it is known to be [12], [13]

In the akF → −∞ limit, theoretical estimates of 0.326 and 0.568 EF G were

reported [14], [15]. More recently, the authors [16] predicted E0 = (0.44 ± 0.01)EF G using

quantum Monte Carlo methods. In this paper we continue that study of the properties of

cold dilute spin 1/2 fermion gas and extend it to all the regimes of 1/akF as a ﬁrst step for

understanding the superﬂuidity and the bosonization of dilute Fermi gases.

The model considered in this study consists of A fermions contained in a box with periodic

conditions on its boundaries. It is not polarized so that half of the spins point up and the

other half down. Typically A is varied from 10 to 20 to estimate properties of uniform gas

in the A → ∞ thermodynamic limit. In some cases larger values of A are used. Fermions

of the same spin do not feel the eﬀects of interaction because it is of short range and Pauli

exclusion predominates. The fermions of diﬀerent spins interact via a central potential v(r)

with the following properties: 1) It is attractive with very short range as we assume the

dilute limit, 2) The details of the potential do not matter, in principle we can think of it as

an attractive delta function potential, and 3) The potential can be adjusted such that we

can sweep through diﬀerent regimes of akF .

From the considerations mentioned above, a cosh potential of the form

v(r) = −v0

2¯h2
m

µ2
cosh2(µr)

,

(2)

can be used. The strength of potential (v0) is adjusted to obtain the desired value of akF .

We can also take appropriate values of µ such that the eﬀective range of the potential Ref f

is much smaller than the interparticle distance r0. When v0 = 1 this potential has a = ±∞

4

and Ref f = 2/µ. In most calculations we have used µr0 = 12. For the a → −∞ case we

also tested the µr0 → ∞ limit using µr0 = 24 [16].

Results of simple lowest order constraint variational (LOCV) calculations are reported

in section II. The LOCV method was ﬁrst used to study neutron matter [17]. Recently,

Cowell et al.

[18] have used it to study cold Bose gases in the unstable a > r0 regime. It

provides a surprisingly good estimate of the ground state energy. Here we use it to study

the eﬀect of the diﬀerence between the cosh (µr0 = 12) and delta-function potentials on

the energy of dilute gases. It becomes signiﬁcant when 1/akF → ∞, and the radius of the

molecule approaches 1/µ. LOCV is also used to estimate the energy of the unstable state of

the Fermi gas for a > 0. The stability of dilute gases is also discussed in the LOCV section

One of the limitations of LOCV is that it can not be used to calculate the pairing energy

gap ∆ or the other superﬂuid properties of Fermi gases. The quantum Monte Carlo methods

used in Ref. [16] and this work to study superﬂuid gases are described in section III, and the

results for the energy, pairing gap and the quasiparticle spectrum are presented in section

IV over the range akF = −1 to ∓∞ to +0.5. Conclusions are given in the last section V.

the Jastrow function

f (rij′), where f (rij′) denotes the pair correlation function. We often
use fij′ to denote f (rij′). fij′ = 1 means no correlation between the pair ij′ and fij′ 6= 1 for

correlated pairs. In variational calculations, the function f (r) is determined by minimizing

The assumption behind LOCV is that the energy is most sensitive to the correlations

of short (less than r0) range. We impose a constraint on the range of f (r) to assure that

the correlations are mostly among the closest pairs, and keep only the pair terms in the

cluster expansion of the energy expectation value. The healing distance d is the range of
f (r) deﬁned such that f (r > d) = 1 and df (r)

dr |r=d = 0. In LOCV, d is chosen such that
on average there is only one other particle within the distance d of any particle. Eﬀects of

deviations from this average are assumed to cancel.

Euler-Lagrange minimization of the energy expectation value[19] gives a Schr¨odinger-like

equation for f (r < d)

The constraint used to determine the healing distance is

and the λ is chosen such that df (r)

dr |r=d = 0. In the equations (6) and (7) we do not have
exchange contributions because the range of the interaction is short and fermions of same

spin do not interact. When the equations (6) and (7) are simultaneously solved, the energy

per particle is given by

ELOCV = EF G +

The results obtained for the ground state energy of spin 1/2 Fermi gas with the cosh and

delta-function potential are shown in Fig. 1.

When 1/akF < 0 the r0 is the only length scale in the gas, and the results obtained

with the cosh potential with µr0 = 12 are indistinguishable from those given by the delta-

function potential. In contrast, when 1/akF > 0, we have a molecular bound state whose

radius provides another length scale. At large positive values of 1/akF there are diﬀerences

between results of the present cosh and delta-function potentials due to the rms radius,

Rrms of the molecule becoming comparable to the range of the present cosh potential. For

example, at 1/akF = 2 we get µRrms = 2.3 with the present choice of µ.

In principle,

we can continue to approximate the delta-function interaction with the cosh potential by

further increasing µ, and working in the µRrms → ∞ limit. However, all of the present

computations are with µr0 = 12.

Fig.1 also shows the presumably exact results obtained with the cosh potential with the

GFMC method described in the next section. The LOCV energies appear to be surprisingly

accurate. However, it should be realized that a part of the accuracy of LOCV is due to

a cancellation of errors, and not due to the quality of the Jastrow-Slater variational wave

function (Eq. 4).

In fact, the variational energy upper bound obtained with that wave

function for 1/akF = 0 is ≈ (0.62 ± 0.01)EF G, signiﬁcantly above GFMC result of (0.44 ±

0.01)EF G. The LOCV energy of 0.46EF G is below the Jastrow-Slater variational upper

bound because it is calculated approximately keeping only two-body cluster contributions.

However, when the contributions of ≥ 3-body clusters become important we can expect that

the approximations in the Jastrow-Slater wave function would also become important, and

the true energy will be below the Jastrow-Slater upper bound.

The LOCV pair correlation functions are shown in Fig. 2. The healing distance d ≈ r0 in

the weakly interacting region, and as we increase the strength of the potential, f (r) becomes

more and more peaked at the origin, and d becomes smaller than r0.

When a > 0 we can obtain another solution of the LOCV equation with a node at r < d.

This solution was discussed by Cowell et al.

[18] for cold Bose gases, and at small values

of akF it gives results in agreement with the low density expansion, (Eq.1). The ﬁrst term

(10akF /9π) is correctly reproduced by LOCV, but the higher order terms are approximate.

In the limit a → ∞ we have the condition kd tan(kd) = −1 discussed in Ref.

[18]. The

7

solution with one node is kd = 2.7983 and it gives E/N = EF G + λ

(kd)2
d2 ≈
3.92EF G. Results obtained with the delta-function potential, including this unstable region

2 = EF G + ¯h2

2m

are shown in Fig. 3. Those corresponding to the nodeless solution of the LOCV equation

are represented by full line, while the dashed line corresponds to the solution with a node.

The state of the gas having a node in the pair correlation function f (r) is unstable because

it has energy > EF G, while that with nodeless f (r) has lower energy < EF G (see Fig. 3).

However, it can have a relatively long life time because energy conservation prevents two

atoms to make the transition to the lower energy state. At least three atoms are needed,

which hinders the transition at low densities. Most of the observed BEC of Bose atoms are

in such unstable states in which the f (r) has nodes at small r.

The E(akF ) shown by the solid line in Fig.3 corresponds to the stable ground state

of the model Hamiltonian with the delta-function interaction. In principle, this state can

be exactly calculated by the quantum Monte Carlo method described in the next section.

However, when the range of the interaction is ﬁnite, as for the cosh model, the system can

collapse to a tightly bound state at large density. This instability can be easily seen in the

Hartree mean ﬁeld approximation in which

EM F (ρ) = EF G(ρ) +

where Iv (< 0) is the volume integral of the interaction. At large enough ρ the interaction

energy becomes larger than EF G leading to a tightly bound state.

Consider for example a simple square well potential of range R such that v(r < R) = −V0

and v(r > R) = 0. Let this potential correspond to a = ∞. This means V0 = ¯h2π2

dilute gas properties.

III. GREEN’S FUNCTION MONTE CARLO CALCULATIONS

Green’s function Monte Carlo (GFMC) [20] is a powerful method for calculating the

ground state properties of many-body quantum systems. It can be used to calculate the

ground state properties of Bose systems with controllable statistical errors without approx-

imation. For the fermion systems, however, we have to deal with the sign problem posed by

the anti-symmetry of the wave function as discussed below. We begin with a brief overview

of the GFMC method.

Let Ψi be the eigenstates of H with eigenvalues Ei. The trial variational wave function

ΨV , which provides an approximation to the ground state Ψ0, can be expanded as

In GFMC we project out Ψ0 from ΨV by evolution in imaginary time

ΨV =

αiΨi .

where we have shifted the origin of energy to ET ≈ E0 to control the norm of Ψ(τ → ∞).

In practice, the time evolution is carried out in n small steps

e−(H−ET )τ =

e−(H−ET )∆τ , ∆τ = τ /n ,

Y

and ET is tuned to keep hΨ(τ )|Ψ(τ )i constant. The tuned ET provides the growth estimate

of the true E0. An alternative method for calculating the ground state energy, often with

smaller statistical error, is given by the mixed estimate (see Fig. 4)

hHimix =

hΨV |H|Ψ(τ → ∞)i
hΨV |Ψ(τ → ∞)i

= E0

hΨV |Ψ(τ → ∞)i
hΨV |Ψ(τ → ∞)i

= E0 .

(11)

(12)

(13)

In general, the time evolution operator or propagator is not known for arbitrary large

value of τ except for few simple systems. However, we can obtain small time prop-

agator with controllable errors for any Hamiltonian with static potentials that depend

only on the positions of the particles denoted by a 3N-dimensional conﬁguration vector

R = {r1, r2, . . . ; r′

1, r′

2, . . .}. This is the motivation to write the time evolution as a product

of many short time operators (Eq. 13). We deﬁne the Green’s function

G(R, R′) = hR|e−(H−ET )∆τ |R′i .

The propagation equation becomes

Ψ(R, τ + ∆τ ) =

dR′G(R, R′)Ψ(R′, τ ) .

This approximation has errors of order ∆τ 3. The total error after n time steps is of the
order ∼ n∆τ 3 = τ 3

n2 . The corrections to this expression can be sampled to make an exact
algorithm. Here we use the more common method and make this error as small as we

want, by increasing the number of steps n. In practice, this error is made smaller than the

statistical sampling errors of the Monte Carlo integration.

A naive quantum Monte Carlo algorithm could start with Ns conﬁguration vectors Ri

sampled from |ΨV |. These provide the approximate representation

ΨV (R) ≃

wiδ(R − Ri)

(19)

where wi = 1 or −1 depending on the sign of ΨV . The accuracy of this representation

increases with the number of samples Ns.

Inserting Eq. 19 into Eq. 16 and using the

short time approximation, gives Ψ(R, ∆τ ) as a sum of normalized gaussians times weight

factors containing the product of the original wi and the exponentials in short time Green’s

Ns

Xi=1

10

function (Eq. 17). Sampling a position from each of the Ns gaussians gives a representation

of Ψ(R, ∆τ ) as a sum of delta functions times weight factors with signs. This process is

repeated n times to obtain Ψ(R, τ = n∆τ ). During the evolution, large magnitude weight

factors are converted into multiple copies while small factors are sampled and kept with

unit magnitude new weight with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the old

weight. The random walk of the weighted δ-function samples representing the propagation

of Ψ(R, τ ), therefore consists of diﬀusing and branching and the number of samples at each

time step can vary.

This algorithm suﬀers from the fermion sign problem. For Ns samples Ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ Ns,

and weights wi, the denominator of a matrix element such as the mixed energy will be the

sum

Ns
i=1 wiΨV (Ri). Each wi carries the sign of the initial sample from ΨV , and if the path
of the sample i has crossed nodes of ΨV odd number of times, the contribution to the sum

P

will be negative. For large times the contribution of these negative paths almost completely

cancel the contribution of positive paths that have not crossed nodes or crossed an even

number of times. The signal dies out exponentially compared to the statistical noise. The

numerator suﬀers from the same problem.

The ﬁxed node[21] approximation deals with the fermion sign problem by restricting the

path so that crossings of the nodal surface are not allowed. When this constraint is imposed

with the nodal surface of the exact fermion ground state, Ψ(R, τ ) converges to that state.

Imposing the nodal surface from an antisymmetric trial function gives an upper bound

We impose the ﬁxed-node constraint with the nodes of our trial function ΨV (R).

Importance sampling is used to control the ﬂuctuations of the weights. The propagation

equation is modiﬁed by multiplying by a positive importance function. Since we are using

the ﬁxed node approximation, the paths have zero probability of crossing the nodes, and we

can take the importance function to be the absolute value of ΨV , The propagation equation

now becomes

Since G0 is still a normalized gaussian, the only changes to the naive algorithm are the

V (R), and the branching of the walk is much reduced. Any paths that cross a node due to

the short time approximation are eliminated.

Since the ﬁxed node calculations give an upper bound to the ground state energy, our

strategy (see Ref. [16]) is to choose a trial wave function with variable nodal surfaces and

minimize the ﬁxed node GFMC hHimix.

The trial wave function ΨV (R) is now used in three diﬀerent contexts; 1) as the initial

guess of the ground state, 2) as the importance function in Eq. 21, and 3) as the node

restriction function. The nodes of the Jastrow-Slater wave function (Eq. 4) equal those of

noninteracting Fermi gas and can not be varied. So that wave function is not useful for

present studies.

From physical considerations, a better trial wave function must reﬂect the fact that the

fermions with attractive interaction can form bound Cooper pairs in the ground state. And

from mathematical considerations, the trial wave function must have variable nodal surface,

12

which can be varied to minimize the ﬁxed node GFMC energy. The BCS wave function is

such a wave function. Commonly, we write

where the number of up spin particles (M) is equal to the number of down spin particles

(M ′). The variational parameters αp are real positive numbers. The free fermion gas, Slater

wave function is just a particular case of this wave function when αp 6= 0 for |kp| ≤ kF and

= 0 for |kp| > kF .

We also consider systems having unpaired particles. In particular, we can have M pairs

and 1 unpaired up or down spin particle. This generalization is necessary as the gap energy ∆

is calculated from the odd-even staggering of the ground state energy [16]. With 1 unpaired

(↑ or ↓ spin) particle in the state ψku(r), with momentum ku, the trial wave function is

given by [22]

ΨBCS(R) = A {[φ(r11′)...φ(rM M ′)] ψku(r)} .

(29)

13

The ground state is expected to have |ku| ≈ |kF | in the weakly interacting regime and

ku → 0 in the strongly interacting regime. This wave function can be calculated as a

determinant [22],[16], which makes the numerical calculations relatively simple.

Quantum Monte Carlo calculations use a ﬁnite number of particles in a cubic periodic

box of volume L3 to simulate the inﬁnite uniform system. The momentum vectors in this

box are discrete

kp =

(npx ˆx + npy ˆy + npz ˆz) ,

and the system has a shell structure with closures occurring when the total number of

particles = 2, 14, 38, 54, . . . for spin-1/2 fermions. The shell number I is deﬁned such that

I = n2

In the present calculations, the pair wave function φ(r) has the assumed form

for r ≤ L/2 ,

for r > L/2 ,

(31)

Here Ic = 4 is a cut oﬀ shell number. We assume that the contributions of shells with I > Ic
to the pair wave function can be approximated by a spherically symmetric function ˜β(r) of

range L/2. We further reduce the statistical ﬂuctuations by using the Jastrow factor along

with ΨBCS in the variational wave function:

ΨV (R) =

f (rij′)ΨBCS(R) .

(32)

The Jastrow factor does not change the nodal structure. Thus, the average value of the

estimated energy is independent of f (r), but the statistical error is reduced by using the

f (r) from LOCV calculations.

It is convenient to require that ∂ ˜β

to the parameter c, and its value is ﬁxed at 10. In addition, γ is chosen such that ∂ ˜β

∂r = 0 at

r = 0; its value is 6 in the limit L → ∞.

The variational parameters are {α0, α1, . . . , αIc} and b. We wish to ﬁnd a set of these pa-

rameters that minimize the ﬁxed node GFMC estimate of energy. However, considering that

we have to allow simultaneous variation of all the parameters, methods based on unguided

variation become diﬃcult, if not infeasible. Again, we rely on the GFMC procedure itself to

optimize these parameters. Initial conﬁgurations are obtained with a random distribution of

the parameters centered around a reasonable guess. Each of them is propagated according

to the nodal constraints provided by their parameters with a single ET . The paths with the

smallest hHimix acquire large amplitudes or weights as τ → ∞. The average among these

paths gives an optimization over the initial random distribution. This process is repeated

several times until convergence is achieved.

When we have an odd number of particles, the ground state momentum ku (Eq. 29) is

an additional variational parameter. We minimize the ﬁxed node GFMC energy of systems

with odd A by varying ku. As discussed in the results section, the magnitude of ku changes

from kF to 0 as the interaction strength increases and we go from the weakly interacting

BCS to strongly interacting BEC regime. The gap energy is obtained from the odd-even

staggering of the total energy

∆(2M + 1) = E(2M + 1) −

(E(2M) + E(2M + 2))

(33)

Results for akF = ∞ are shown in Fig. 5. The energy per particle E/A and the gap ∆ do

not have a signiﬁcant A dependence in this case. These results were reported in Ref. [16],

and results for other values of akF are presented in the next section.

IV. RESULTS

The values of the parameters, α0−4 and b, of the BCS wave function are to be determined

by minimizing the ﬁxed node GFMC mixed energy for each value of akF and A. The

15

minimum energy obtained is our estimate for the ground state energy of the system. The

values of the parameters that minimize this energy are not very sensitive to A, the number of

particles in the box. We ﬁnd it suﬃcient to determine the optimum parameters at A = 10, 14

and 20, and interpolate their values in the A = 10, 14 and A = 14, 20 ranges. The values of

the parameters at these values of A are listed in Table I.

At akF = −1 the lowest energies are obtained without any short range ˜β(r) and the

optimum pair function has contributions only from the states with I ≤ 3. This is consistant

with the weak coupling BCS theory in which αk goes to zero when k − kF becomes large.

When 1/akF > −1, lower energies are obtained with ˜β(r) 6= 0. In most cases, the values

of the parameters do not change signiﬁcantly between A = 14 and 20. The values listed in

Table I for A = 14 are used for 14 ≤ A ≤ 20.

In the 0 < 1/akF ≤ 2 range, the optimum values of the parameters of ΨBCS do not seem

to change signiﬁcantly with the akF . We have not obtained any signiﬁcant improvements to

the energy from varying the parameters in the region 1/akF > 0. In this region we retain the

values found for 1/akF = 0 and A = 14. Recall that only the nodal surfaces of the ground

state wave function are constrained by those of ΨBCS. The complete ΨV has an additional

product of Jastrow pair correlation functions f (rij′) which depends on akF , and the true

ground state wave function changes continuously with akF .

The magnitude of the momentum ku of the unpaired particle in the ground state is also

determined by minimizing the GFMC ﬁxed node energy. The minimum values are listed in

Table II. In the weak coupling limit, the BCS ground state for odd A has |ku| = |kF |. In

the periodic box, the value of k2

F is 1 for 2 < A ≤ 14, and 2 for 14 < A ≤ 38 in units of

(2π/L)2. In the akF = 0 to −3 range, the minimum values of k2
weak coupling BCS theory. However, in the −10 to 3 range the k2

u are as indicated by the
u is 1 for the entire range

(11 to 19) of odd values of A considered. At akF = 2 the states with k2

u = 0 and 1 are
almost degenerate, and for 1/akF > 0.5 the ground states of odd A systems have ku = 0,

as expected when the system consists of bound molecules condensed in the zero momentum

state, and the unpaired particle also in the ku = 0 state.

16

The calculated values of the ground state energy are shown in ﬁgures 6 and 7. The systems

with 1/akF ≤ 1/3 seem to have E > 0, while those with 1/akF > 1/3 can have E < 0. When

1/a > 0 the two-body interaction is strong enough to bind two particles and form molecules

with energy denoted by Emol. The energy per particle, E/A of the superﬂuid Fermi gas

is compared with Emol/2 in ﬁgure 8. Within the computational errors E/A > Emol/2 (see

Table III), however at 1/akF ≥ 0.5 we ﬁnd that E/A is very close to Emol/2. This behavior

also indicates that at these values of akF the system approaches that composed of Bose

molecules forming a BEC. It has been argued that the interaction between these molecules

is weakly repulsive, with a molecule-molecule scattering length given by amm = 0.6a [23].

In this case the E/A will always be greater than Emol/2, and the gas will have positive

pressure, E/A increasing with the gas density or kF .

The pairing gaps calculated from the odd-even energy diﬀerence (Eq. 33) are shown in

ﬁgures 9 and 10. These gaps are not very sensitive to A, and they are compared with the

predictions of BCS [3] and Gorkov [5] estimates given by

(35)

At 1/akF << 0 the calculated gaps are in between these estimates, while at positive values

of 1/akF they approach Emol/2 as expected for a gas of Bose molecules (see Table III).

Figures 8 and 11 also show the Emol for a delta-function interaction in addition to those

for the present cosh potential with µro = 12. The two potentials give essentially the same

results for 1/akF < 0.5, but at larger values the cosh potential is more attractive. The values

of the rms radius of the molecule are listed in Table III. At large values of 1/akF the µRrms

is not very large for the present choice of µr0 = 12, and much larger values of µ should be

used to approximate the delta-function interaction.

17

V. CONCLUSIONS

The present work shows that accurate calculations of the pairing gaps and energies of

superﬂuid Fermi gases are possible with the ﬁxed node GFMC method. The unknown nodal

surfaces can be determined variationally by minimizing the ﬁxed node GFMC energy. This

method gives the exact result in the 1/akF → −∞ (Fermi gas) and 1/akF → +∞ (BEC of

molecules) limits for short range attractive interaction, and seems to overcome the fermion

sign problem. An alternative method based on path integral Monte Carlo simulations is also

being developed [24].

For 1/akF << 0 we obtain a weakly interacting BCS superﬂuid with ∆ much smaller

than E/A, while at 1/akF >> 0, ∆ ∼ −E/A ∼ −Emol/2 appropriate for a Bose gas of

molecules.

In the transition region, where 1/akF ∼ 0, the ∆ is signiﬁcantly larger than

|E|/A.

In the weak BCS superﬂuid the ground state of systems with odd number of particles is

expected to have momentum kF , while in the molecular liquid with BEC it is expected to

have zero momentum. With this criteria the calculated values of k2

u (Table II) suggest that
the BCS to BEC transition occurs in the range −0.5 < 1/akF < 0.5. It appears to be a

smooth transition. In this transition region the calculated value of the gap ∆ changes from

being larger than the Gorkov estimate to smaller. At 1/akF ≈ 0 our value of ∆ is very close

to Gorkov estimate.

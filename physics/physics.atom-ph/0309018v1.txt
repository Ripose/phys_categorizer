We consider one-loop self-energy and vacuum polarization radiative corrections to the shift of
atomic energy level due to ﬁnite nuclear size. Analytic expressions for vacuum polarization correc-
tions are derived. For the self-energy of p1/2 and p3/2 states in addition to already known terms
we derive next-to-leading nonlogarithmic Zα-terms. Together with contributions obtained earlier
the terms derived in the present work give explicit analytic expressions for s1/2 and p1/2 corrections
which agree with results of previous numerical calculations up to Z=100 (Z is the nuclear charge
number). We also show that the ﬁnite nuclear size radiative correction for a p3/2 state is not small
compared to the similar correction for a p1/2 state at least for small Z.

INTRODUCTION

Experimental and theoretical investigations of the radiative shift (Lamb shift) of energy levels in heavy atoms and
ions is an important way to test Quantum Electrodynamics in the presence of a strong external electric ﬁeld. One
of the eﬀects related to this problem is the dependence of the Lamb shift on the ﬁnite nuclear size (FNS). One can
also look at this eﬀect from another point of view. It is well known that there is an isotope shift of atomic levels due
to the FNS. Corrections we are talking about are the radiative corrections to the isotope shift. There are two types
of corrections. The ﬁrst type is due to vacuum polarization and we will call them VPFNS corrections. The second
type is due to the electron self-energy and vertex and we will call them SEVFNS corrections. Calculations of both
VPFNS and SEVFNS corrections have attracted a lot of attention, for a review see Ref.
[1]. Until recently it was
mainly numerical work. The corrections for 1s, 2s, and 2p states have been calculated numerically, exactly in Zα,
in Refs.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; see also review [9] for muonic atoms . Here Z is the nuclear charge number and α is the
ﬁne structure constant. Analytical calculations have been based on Zα-expansion. The s-wave VPFNS correction
has been calculated a long time ago in order α(Zα) [10, 11]. An ultraviolet logarithmic enhancement of higher order
contributions to the VPFNS correction has been revealed in Ref. [12]. The enhancement factor is ln2(λC /r0), where
λC is the Compton wave length and r0 is the nuclear radius. In Ref. [12] the double-logarithmic contribution to the
radiative correction to atomic parity nonconservation has been calculated analytically exactly in Zα. The formula
derived in [12] gives also one of the double-logarithmic contributions to the VPFNS correction for s1/2 and p1/2 states.
The SEVFNS correction for an s-wave state has been calculated analytically in order α(Zα) in Refs.[13, 14, 15, 16],
see also reviews [17, 18]. Structure of higher-order contributions to the SEVFNS correction has been elucidated in
our recent papers [15, 16]. The contributions are also logarithmically enhanced, but the enhancement factor contains
only ﬁrst power of ln(λC /r0). For s1/2 and p1/2 states prefactor before the logarithm has been calculated in Ref. [15]
in order α(Zα)2 and in Ref. [16] exactly in Zα. Finally, contributions of the order α(Zα)0 to SEVFNS corrections
for p1/2 and p3/2 states have been calculated in recent papers [19, 20].

In the present work we ﬁrst calculate nonlogarithmic α(Zα) terms of SEVFNS corrections for p1/2 and p3/2 states.
Together with previously known contributions this gives a full analytic description for p1/2 SEVFNS correction which
agrees with previous numerical results up to Z = 100. Our calculation demonstrates also that the p3/2 SEVFNS
correction is comparable with the p1/2 SEVFNS correction. The second part of the work is devoted to analytical

calculations of VPFNS corrections for s1/2 and p1/2 states. Analytic formulas obtained in this paper agree with
previous numerical results up to Z = 100.

The structure of the present paper is as follows. In Sec. II the general structure of SEVFNS and VPFNS corrections
is discussed. In Sec. III we calculate α(Zα) terms for p1/2 and p3/2 SEVFNS corrections, summarize all known terms
for s-wave and p-wave corrections and compare analytic expressions with previous numerical results.In Sec. IV we
ﬁrst calculate unknown contributions to the VPFNS correction. Then we summarize contributions calculated in the
present work and corrections obtained before and compare our analytic results with previous numerical calculations.
Finally, Sec. V presents our conclusions.

II. GENERAL STRUCTURE OF SEVFNS AND VPFNS RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS

Due to the ﬁnite nuclear size, the electric potential V (r) of the nucleus diﬀers from that for a point-like nucleus.

Due to ultrarelativistic nature of the problem the strong relativistic enhancement is a special property of SEVFNS
and VPFNS radiative corrections. This is similar to atomic parity nonconservation (PNC) [22]. The relativistic
enhancement factor for s1/2 and p1/2 states is proportional to Rrel ∼

To be absolutely correct we should say that expectation values of the perturbation (1) taken with the wave functions
(4) are not suﬃcient to calculate the energy shifts. One has also to take into account deformation of the wave function
inside the nucleus. However, Eqs. (5) take this eﬀect into account, and as soon as it is done there is no need to care
about this detail any more.

Diagrams Fig.1(b-e) show the radiative corrections under discussion, see also comment [24]. Diagrams Fig.1b (self-
energy) and Fig.1c (vertex) describe the SEVFNS correction and diagrams Fig.1d and Fig.1e describe the VPFNS
correction. Note that Fig.1d corresponds to a modiﬁcation of δV (see Eq. (1)) due to the vacuum polarization,
and Fig.1e corresponds to a modiﬁcation of the electron wave function due to the vacuum polarization. Each of the
diagrams Fig.1(b-e) gives some energy shift δEi, i=b,c,d,e. Let us stress that for s1/2 and p1/2 states we always
calculate a relative value of the radiative correction

∆s1/2 = δEs1/2 /∆Es1/2 ,
∆p1/2 = δEp1/2 /∆Ep1/2 ,
where ∆E is the FNS shift given by diagram Fig.1a for the same atomic state. To ﬁnd the value of ∆E one can
use Eqs. (5), or a numerical calculation or any other method. Situation with p3/2 correction is diﬀerent and we
discuss this at the end of section III (see Eq. (23). So, a crucially important point is that we calculate analytically
only the relative quantity ∆ . This is the central issue of this work as well as of our recent papers [12, 15, 16, 19].
The point is that convergence of Zα-expansion for ∆ is quite reasonable while the ultrarelativistic character of the
FNS eﬀect mentioned above makes the convergence of Zα-expansion for δE very poor. The good convergence of the
series for the quantity ∆ is related to separation of scales. Radiative corrections which do not contain ln(λC /r0) are
λC . On the other hand, the perturbation is nonzero only
related to quantum ﬂuctuations at ”large” distances, r
at small distances r
λC . Therefore, the enhancement related to small distances in the contribution of ”large
distance” quantum ﬂuctuations is factorized similar to (5) , in essence this is a kind of eﬀective operator approach.
There are also quantum ﬂuctuations from distances r0 < r < λC , their contribution cannot be trivially factorized
and we take special care about these ﬂuctuations. This is where terms dependent on ln(λC /r0) come from. The
factorization of small distance enhancement in the part of the FNS eﬀect related to the vacuum polarization was
implicitly demonstrated in Ref. [25].

III. SELF-ENERGY AND VERTEX FNS RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS

Technically the most complicated are the self-energy and the vertex FNS radiative corrections (SEVFNS) given by
diagrams in Fig.1b and Fig.1c. It has been demonstrated in paper [12] that relative SEVFNS corrections for s1/2 and

Now we calculate the α(Zα) term in the expansion of

Bp1/2. The electron wave function at small distances is given
by Eq. (4). Let us ﬁrst calculate the leading contribution to the FNS shift given by diagram in Fig.1a. For s1/2
and p3/2 states the upper component of the Dirac spinor (4) is much larger than the lower one. Hence, the upper
component determines the FNS shift of such a state. On the other hand, for a p1/2 state the lower component and
hence its contribution to the FNS shift is dominating. A straightforward calculation gives the following values for the
FNS shifts of s and p states (diagram Fig.1(a))

As one should expect, the FNS corrections (13) obey the following inequalities ∆Es1/2 ≫
λC . To calculate
these ”soft” corrections it is suﬃcient to use nonrelativistic electron wave functions and, instead of (1), to use an
eﬀective FNS perturbation that reproduces the FNS correction ∆Ens1/2 for s-wave states, see Eq. (13) and Ref.[19].

These corrections are due to quantum ﬂuctuations with the frequency (Zα)2m . ω . m. Therefore, the eﬀective
operator is calculated with the relativistic eﬀects taken into account. However, due to the behavior of the wave
functions of p-states at r
λC /(Zα), it is possible to average this operator in the leading approximation over the
nonrelativistic wave function. For s-states the situation is quite diﬀerent [26].

We will see that next-order corrections δE(1)

p3/2 do not contain any logarithms, hence they come from
quantum ﬂuctuations at r

approach, see, e. g. Ref. [17]. In this approach we ﬁrst of all calculate scattering amplitude, described by diagrams
shown in Fig.4. External electron momenta in Fig.4 are on mass shell and it is suﬃcient to consider scattering at

m. Here p1 and p2 are initial and ﬁnal momenta of the electron, respectively. To ﬁnd the
low momenta
energy shift one has to average the scattering amplitude over nonrelataivistic wave function of atomic electron. We
have already used this technique to calculate (10) and to calculate a similar term for atomic parity nonconservation
eﬀect, see Refs. [15, 16]. Similar to these papers we use here the Fried-Yennie gauge [27]. One can ﬁnd expressions
for renormalized self-energy and vertex operators (ultraviolet renormalization) in this gauge in Refs.[17] and [16].
However, the present calculation is more complicated than that in [15, 16]. The point is that in Refs.
[15, 16] it
was suﬃcient to calculate only the forward scattering amplitude, p1 = p2. In the present case we have to consider
scattering at arbitrary angle, p1 6
It is not just a simple technical complication. The forward scattering
amplitude is always infrared convergent. On the other hand the ﬁnite angle amplitude is always infrared divergent
because of long range nature of the Coulomb ﬁeld. To solve the problem we regularize the Coulomb interaction
in Fig.4, 1/k2
. Performing calculations we throw away all terms inversely
proportional to λ because they correspond not to the true radiative corrections, but just to Coulomb corrections to
the scattering amplitude corresponding to Eqs. (17). Since we perform calculations in the Fried-Yennie gauge there
is no need in an infrared regularization of non-Coulomb photon propagator in diagrams Fig.4. After a pretty long

Let us discuss now the SEVFNS correction for a p3/2 state. In this case the deﬁnition (7) for the relative value of
r2
, and
the correction is not sensible. The point is that according to (17) and (20) the SEVFNS correction δEp3/2 ∝ h
i
1. This
. Therefore the deﬁnition (7) would imply that ∆p3/2 ≫
according to (13) the FNS correction ∆Ep3/2 ∝ h
i
itself is not a problem, just some rescaling. The real problem is that diﬀerent powers of r2 indicate that relativistic
factors for δEp3/2 and ∆Ep3/2 are diﬀerent. Therefore convergence of (Zα)-expansion for ∆p3/2 deﬁned according to
Eq. (7) must be very poor. Instead we deﬁne ∆p3/2 as

r4

ln(bλC /r0) .

(22)

∆np3/2 = δEnp3/2 /∆Enp1/2 .

(23)

This is the ratio of the SEVFNS energy shift for np3/2 state and the FNS energy shift for np1/2 state. Using deﬁnition
r0) eﬀects into ∆Enp1/2 , and therefore, according to the eﬀective operator
(23) we absorb all small-distance (r
approach explained in section II, we expect a reasonable convergence of (Zα)-expansion for ∆np3/2 . Using δE(0)
from Eq. (17), δE(1)
np3/2 from Eq. (20), ∆Enp1/2 from (13) as well as the deﬁnition (23) we obtain

Again, the constant near the logarithm depends on the principal quantum number. Equation (24) corresponds to the

IV. VACUUM POLARIZATION FNS RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS

In this section we consider vacuum polarization FNS radiative corrections (VPFNS) given by diagrams in Fig.1d
In the leading order in (Zα) the diagrams Fig.1d and Fig.1e can be
and Fig.1e. Let us start from s1/2 states.

The solid line describes electron, the zigzag line denotes FNS perturbation (16), the dashed line denotes photon, and the cross
denotes the nucleus.

give equal contributions, and their total contribution to the s-wave VPFNS correction is [10, 11]

Logarithmically enhanced contribution of diagram Fig.1e has been calculated in Ref.[12], it reads

This formula is equally valid for s1/2 and p1/2 states, for deﬁnition of parameters see Eq.(8). A logarithmically
enhanced contribution of the diagram Fig.1d has not been calculated yet. A similar contribution has been estimated
in Refs.[15, 16] in relation to atomic parity nonconservation (PNC). For PNC this contribution is strongly suppressed
4 sin2 θW , where θW is the Weinberg angle, therefore there have been no need in an accurate
by the factor 1
calculation. Now we perform an accurate calculation, the calculation is equally valid for s1/2 and p1/2 states.

According to (4) the electron density at r

(Zα)λC is

where M is some constant. Fourier transform of the density reads

ρ(r)dr = M

4π
k2γ+1 sin (πγ) Γ(2γ) ,

Z

where Γ(x) is the gamma function. Then, due to Eqs. (1) and (2) the FNS energy shift given by diagram Fig.1a reads

To generate diagram Fig.1d one has to account for the electron loop in the interaction energy (29). To do so we

perform the following replacement in (29), see, e.g., Ref. [17] and comment [29]

The simplest way to obtain this limiting behavior is to expand intermediate expressions (29) and(31), however, one
can also obtain the same result expanding the exact answer (34).

Behavior of the exact expression (34) between asymptotical regimes (35) and (36) depends on the particular form
factor F . However, the dependence is pretty weak, and for further analysis we use the form factor of uniformly charged
ball of radius r0.

Let us consider now the VPFNS correction for a p1/2 state. Logarithmically enhanced contributions (26) and (34)

are exactly the same as for s1/2 states. There is also a contribution of zero order in (Zα) calculated in [19]

To calculate the ﬁrst order correction we once more employ the eﬀective operator approach and consider the scattering
= p2. Similar to the procedure described in Section III we regularize the
amplitude described by Fig.5, in this case p1 6
Coulomb interaction in Fig.5, 1/k2
. Performing calculations we throw away
all terms inversely proportional to λ because they correspond not to true radiative corrections, but just to Coulomb
corrections to scattering amplitude corresponding to Eq. (41). Then we obtain the following result for the ﬁrst-order
correction

In principle the unaccounted contribution u(Zα) can be diﬀerent from that in (39). The correction (43) with u(Zα) = 0
is plotted in Fig.6b by a solid line. Results of computations of ∆V P
p1/2 performed in Ref [3] for 2p1/2 states are shown
by diamonds. Once more, the agreement is pretty good. We also ﬁnd unknown u(Zα) ﬁtting the numerical data [3].
The ﬁt gives the result very close to that for s-wave, see Eq. (40). The dashed line in Fig.6b shows the correction
(43) with u(Zα) given by Eq. (40).

Finally we consider the VPFNS correction for a p3/2 state, the relative correction is deﬁned according to Eq. (23).

In the present work we have calculated analytically the ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect on Lamb shift of s1/2, p1/2, and
p3/2 atomic states. Corresponding radiative corrections are strongly aﬀected by ultrarelativistic behavior of electrons
in the vicinity of the nucleus. As a result of this behavior the convergence of Zα-expansion is very poor for absolute
energy shifts, and on the other hand the convergence is reasonably good for relative corrections which we consider.
We deﬁne the relative corrections for s1/2 and p1/2 states according to Eq. (7), and for p3/2 states according to Eq.
(23). The self-energy and vertex ﬁnite size (SEVFNS) relative radiative correction for a s1/2 state is given by Eq.
(11). The SEVFNS correction for a p1/2 state is given by Eq. (22), and the SEVFNS correction for a p3/2 state is
given by Eq. (24). The vacuum polarization ﬁnite size (VPFNS) relative radiative correction for a s1/2 state is given
by Eqs. (39),(40). The VPFNS correction for a p1/2 state is given by Eqs. (43),(40), and the VPFNS correction
for a p3/2 is given by Eq. (46). Our analytical results for s1/2 and p1/2 states agree well with previous numerical
calculations.

Finally, in Fig. 7 we plot the total radiative corrections which include self-energy, vertex and vacuum polarization
diagrams (SEVFNS + VPFNS). For s1/2 and p1/2 states at large Z there are strong compensations between SEVFNS
and VPFNS contributions. We would like to attract attention to the p3/2 correction. The same normalization is used
for p1/2 and p3/2 states. Therefore, from Fig. 7 we come to a somewhat paradoxical conclusion that at large Z the
ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect on Lamb shift of p3/2 states is larger than that for p1/2 states. Moreover, using Fig. 7 and
Eqs. (5) we conclude that at large Z the ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect on Lamb shift of p3/2 states is only by a few times
smaller than that for s states. These conclusions are not consistent with numerical data [3] at large Z. Certainly, our
calculation for p3/2 states is valid only up to the order α(Zα). The p3/2 correction does not contain the ultraviolet
logarithm and therefore the convergence of Zα-expansion can be diﬀerent from that for s1/2 and p1/2 states. A poor
convergence of the expansion could be the reason for disagreement with previous numerical calculatins. However a
new exact in Zα numerical calculation for p3/2 states would be interesting.

[24] Except of diagrams shown in Fig. 1 there is also a contribution related to normalization of the bound state wave function
(a ”derivative term”). This term is not important for calculations performed in the present work. However, it is important
for calculations performed in our previous papers [15, 16] results of which we use here. The “derivative term” has been
taken into account in [15, 16].

[28] In the previous work [19] we found the α(Zα)-term in Eqs. (21),(22) by ﬁtting numerical data [4, 5]. As a result of the
ﬁt we got −2.75α(Zα). According to the calculation performed in the present work the exact result reads (379/432 −
16/3 ln 2)α(Zα) = −2.819α(Zα).

[29] In this work we do not consider Wichmann-Kroll corrections. These corrections to the induced-charge density related to

the FNS eﬀect were considered in [25].

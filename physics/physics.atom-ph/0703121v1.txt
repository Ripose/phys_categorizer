Core-valence correlations for atoms with open shells

V. A. Dzuba and V. V. Flambaum
School of Physics, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We present an eﬃcient method of inclusion of the core-valence correlations into the conﬁguration
interaction (CI) calculations. These correlations take place in the core area where the potential
of external electrons is approximately constant. A constant potential does not change the core
electron wave functions and Green’s functions. Therefore, all operators describing interaction of M
valence electrons and N − M core electrons (the core part of the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian V N−M ,
the correlation potential ˆΣ1(r, r′, E) and the screening of interaction between valence electrons by
the core electrons ˆΣ2) may be calculated with all M valence electrons removed. This allows one
to avoid subtraction diagrams which make accurate inclusion of the core-valence correlations for
M > 2 prohibitively complicated. Then the CI Hamiltonian for M valence electrons is calculated
using orbitals in complete V N potential (the mean ﬁeld produced by all electrons); ˆΣ1 + ˆΣ2 are
added to the CI Hamiltonian to account for the core-valence correlations. We calculate ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2
using many-body perturbation theory in which dominating classes of diagrams are included in all
orders. We use neutral Xe I and all positive ions up to Xe VIII as a testing ground. We found
that the core electron density for all these systems is practically the same. Therefore, we use the
same ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 to build the CI Hamiltonian in all these systems (M = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Good
agreement with experiment for energy levels and Land´e factors is demonstrated for all cases from
Xe I to Xe VIII.

INTRODUCTION

Accurate calculations for many-electron atoms play
an important role in many advanced topics of modern
physics. This includes parity and time invariance vio-
lating phenomena in atoms [1], search for manifestation
of possible variation of fundamental constants in astro-
physical data [2], or in present-day laboratory experi-
ments [3], improving accuracy of atomic clocks [4], study
of super-heavy elements (see, e.g. [5]), etc. Calculations
are needed for planning of experiments and interpreta-
tion of the results.

Atoms of the most interest for the listed topics are
usually found in the second part of the periodic table
where measurements or observations are more likely to
give useful information due to strong enhancement of the
eﬀects caused by interplay between relativistic and many-
body eﬀects. On the other hand, accurate treatment of
relativistic and many-body eﬀects represent a big chal-
lenge for atomic calculations. Not surprisingly, the num-
ber of methods capable of producing reliable and accu-
rate results is very limited. The most advanced methods
have been developed for atoms with one external electron
above closed shells. For example, most accurate calcu-
lations of the parity non-conservation in cesium where
carried out with two most advanced methods. One was
the correlation potential (CP) method [6] combined with
the all-order perturbation theory in screened Coulomb
interaction [7] and the other was the linearized coupled
cluster approach [8]. With these two methods, energy
levels and transition amplitudes for alkali atoms can be
calculated to the accuracy of fraction of percent while
hyperﬁne structure and parity violating amplitudes are

calculated to the accuracy of 0.5 - 1% [7, 8, 9].

For atoms with more than one external electron in open
shells the accuracy of calculations is signiﬁcantly lower.
For example, the best accuracy achieved for PNC in Tl is
around 3% (3% in Ref. [10] and 2.5% in Ref. [11]). Typ-
ical accuracy for energies is about 1% or worse. The
main challenge is the need for accurate treatment of
both core-valence and valence-valence correlations. The
most commonly used methods can be divided in sev-
eral main groups: (a) many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT) (see, e.g. [12]), (b) coupled cluster approach
(CC) (see, e.g. [13]), (c) conﬁguration interaction (CI)
(see, e.g. [14]), and (d) multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock
method (MCDF)(see, e.q. [15]). There are also combina-
tions of these basic techniques.

All of these method have their limitations. For exam-
ple, CI usually treats correlations between valence elec-
trons very accurately but core-valence correlations are
either totally neglected or only small fraction of them is
included. MBPT can include more core-valence corre-
lations, but its application to the correlations between
valence electrons is limited by the fact that these corre-
lations are often too strong to be treated perturbatively.
The CC approach includes certain types of core-valence
and valence-valence correlations in all-orders and in prin-
ciple can be formulated for any number of valence elec-
trons. However, the equations are complicated and most
of practical realization of the method deal with only one
or two electrons (or an electron and a hole).

Signiﬁcant progress can be achieved by combin-
In 1996 we developed a
ing diﬀerent techniques.
method which combines the MBPT with the CI method
(CI+MBPT) [16]. Here, the second-order MBPT was
used to construct the eﬀective Hamiltonian in the va-

lence space which includes the core-valence correlations.
It diﬀers from the standard CI Hamiltonian by an ex-
tra correlation operator ˆΣ which accounts for the core-
valence correlations. Single-electron part of this operator
is very similar to the correlation potential used for atoms
with one external electron [6]. It was demonstrated that
inclusion of the core-valence correlations lead to a signif-
icant improvement of the accuracy of calculations (see,
e.g. [16, 17, 18, 19]). Savukov and co-workers [20] devel-
oped a version of the method which uses the hole-particle
formalism. They applied the technique for a calculation
of the electron structure of the noble-gas atoms [20, 21].
The CI+MBPT method was successfully used for
a number of atoms with two or three valence elec-
trons [16, 17, 22] (or an electron and a hole [20, 21]).
Its extension to atoms with more electrons in open shells
meets some diﬃculties.
It turns out that convergence
of the MBPT varies very much from atom to atom and
strongly depends on an initial approximation. The core-
valence correlations are often too large if treated in the
same fashion as in our original works and their inclusion
does not improve the results.

It is widely accepted that the Hartree-Fock potential
is the best choice as a zero approximation for consequent
use of the MBPT due to great reduction of the terms
caused by exact cancellation between the potential and
electron-electron Coulomb terms. However, for atoms
with open shells HF procedure is not deﬁned unambigu-
ously. This is especially true when the CI method is to
be used. Here we have freedom of how many electrons
are to be included into the initial HF procedure and how
many electrons are to be treated as valence electrons in
the CI calculations. It was found in our previous work
[23] that for a wide range of atoms the best choice is the
so-called V N −M approximation. These are the atoms in
which valence electrons form a separate shell, deﬁned by
the same principal quantum number. For example, the
ground state conﬁguration of xenon is [Pd]5s25p6.
Its
eight outermost electrons have n = 5 while all other elec-
trons have n < 5. This means that eight outermost elec-
trons should be treated as valence electrons and the ini-
tial HF procedure should not include them. This greatly
simpliﬁes the MBPT, improves its convergence and al-
lows one to include higher-order correlations in the same
way as it was done for atoms with one external electron.
The aim of the present work is to develop a solid the-
oretical background for use of the V N −M potential as a
starting point. In principle, this starting point is equiv-
alent to any other choice of the initial HF potential.
Indeed, the actual role of the subtraction diagrams in
the correlation operators ˆΣ is to reduce results obtained
with any zero approximation to V N −M results (see an
explanation below). However, the technique for V N −M
is much simpler (no subtraction diagrams) and allows
us to sum dominating chains of higher order diagrams
to all orders (it is practically impossible for other choice
of zero approximation). This results in a higher accu-
racy. Another advance of the present work is the use

2

of a compact basis for valence states.
In our previous
works [22, 23, 24, 25] we used the same basis to cal-
culate ˆΣ and to do the CI calculations. The basis was
formed from the eigenstates of the ˆV N −M potential. This
had an advantage of having the same single- and double-
electron matrix elements for all ions of the same atom.
Moving from ion to ion was easy, requiring only change
the number of electrons in the CI calculations. How-
ever, convergence of the CI calculations rapidly deterio-
rated with growing number of electrons. When number
of electrons became as large as eight, saturation of the
basis was very hard to achieve unless huge computer re-
sources were used. In present work we demonstrate that
the basis states for valence electrons don’t have to be
eigenstates of the ˆV N −M potential. Instead, HF states
calculated in the mean ﬁeld of all electrons (of a neutral
atom or corresponding positive ion) can be used after mi-
nor modiﬁcations. In this case we have to recalculate the
CI basis when we change the number of valence electrons
M . However, the gain is much larger. Since HF states
are already good approximations to the wave functions of
valence electrons we can limit the basis to just few states
in each partial wave. Therefore, even for eight valence
electrons the CI matrix is small, its calculation and diag-
onalization takes little time but the ﬁnal results are very
accurate.

We calculate energy levels and Land´e g-factors for neu-
tral xenon and all its positive ions from X II to Xe VIII
for illustration on how the technique works. Good agree-
ment with experiment is demonstrated for all cases while
very little computer resources are needed on every stage
of the calculations.

α and β are the Dirac matrices, Ze is the nuclear charge
and Vcore is the electrostatic potential created by the core
electrons. Regardless of initial approximation used to
calculate core and valence states, the valence electrons
never contribute to Vcore directly. They can only con-
tribute to Vcore via the self-consistent HF procedure or
via any other potential used to represent valence elec-
trons. If the core electrons and valence electrons belong
to diﬀerent shells the eﬀect of the valence electrons on

trons have n < 5. Therefore, if the eight electrons are
considered to be valence electrons we should expect that
they have little eﬀect on the core states. Fig. 1 shows
electron densities of Xe I and Xe IX calculated in the
HF approximation. For the neutral Xe I electron densi-
ties of valence and core electrons are shown separately.
One can see that the overlap between them is indeed very
small. Therefore, it turns out that when electron density
of Xe IX is calculated it practically coincides with the
electron density of the core states of neutral Xe. The
former is shown by dots of Fig. 1. Resolution of this ﬁg-
ure doesn’t allow us to see any diﬀerence between elec-
tron densities of Xe IX and the core of Xe I. This is in
spite of huge diﬀerence in energies of core states of two
atoms. One may argue that huge diﬀerence in energies
should lead to a noticeable diﬀerence in wave functions,
at least on large distances. Indeed, a wave function of an
atomic electron has asymptotic deﬁned by its energy and
potential

However, in the area up to the radius of the valence shell

there is actually no diﬀerence in E

orbitals in Xe IX and Xe I since δE =

i
ence in asymptotic behavior appears only near the radius
of the valence shell where the core electron density is ex-
tremely small.

Thus we conclude that the core electron density and
potential have practically no dependence on the number
of valence electrons if the valence electrons are in a dif-
ferent shell.

III. THE CORE-VALENCE CORRELATION
CORRECTIONS IN THE V N AND V N−M
APPROXIMATIONS

The use of the Feynman diagram technique allows us to
express the core-valence correlation corrections in terms
of the single-particle wave functions and Green’s func-
tions [7] (see Appendix). Therefore, all the arguments
presented above are applicable when we consider calcu-
lation of the correlation operators ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2; they may
be calculated using V N −M basis for core electrons.

It may be instructive to clarify this conclusion using
more popular Schroedinger perturbation theory where
explicit summation over intermediate states is involved.
The correlations between the valence and core electrons
as well as the screening of the interaction between the
valence electrons happen inside the area occupied by the
core electrons. Let us enclose the core by a sphere with
zero boundary condition for the core electrons. This al-
lows us to reduce the core electron problem to the discrete
spectrum. Let us now consider the interaction of the core
electrons with external electrons using the perturbation
theory. The constant potential V0 of external electrons
does not change the core electron wave functions. It also

electron states in the core and thus on Vcore can be ex-
tremely small. Indeed, in this case the overlap between
density of the valence electrons and density of the core
electrons is small. Therefore, the exchange interaction
between the core and valence electrons, which is propor-
tional to the overlap, is negligible in comparison with en-
ergy of the core electrons. On the other hand, the direct
potential created by the valence electrons is practically
constant inside the core since nearly all charge of the va-
lence electrons is located outside the core. Constant po-
tential corresponds to zero electric ﬁeld and cannot have
any eﬀect on the wave function of the core electrons. The
only eﬀect of the constant potential V0 is in energy shift
δE = V0. However, it does not change the single-particle
wave functions and Green’s functions of core electrons
since the wave equation contains the diﬀerence E
V0
which does not change. We may formulate this conclu-
sion using the perturbation theory. In ﬁrst order in V0
a core state a in the V N −M approximation and ˜a in the
V N approximation are related by

Small overlap between the core and valence states usu-
ally takes place when these states correspond to diﬀerent
atomic shells deﬁned by the principal quantum number

electrons have principal quantum number n = 5 (the

the enclosed “core”states, they are shifted by the same
energy V0 (note that these enclosed states form complete
basis set inside the sphere). Therefore, all the terms in
the perturbation theory for the core-valence interaction
(beyond the mean ﬁeld which we take into account in
the V N valence orbitals) do not depend on the specta-
tor valence electrons. This is why we can calculate all
core-valence correlations using the V N −M core orbitals.
To avoid misunderstanding we should note that we use
this picture for the explanation only, no special bound-
ary conditions for core electrons are needed for actual
calculations (it is obvious if we use the Green’s function
technique; all the integrals over coordinates are domi-
nated by the core area where the correlations between
the valence and core electrons actually happen). Note
that below we do not neglect eﬀects of V0, we only treat
them as a perturbation since the non-diagonal matrix el-
ements

are small.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian of the CI+MBPT method
has the form similar to (1) but with extra terms for sin-
gle and double electron parts of it. These terms, for
which we use notation ˆΣ, describe the core-valence cor-
relations [16]. There is a single-electron operator ˆΣ1
which is added to the single-electron part ˆh1 (2) of the
CI Hamiltonian:

ˆΣ1 describes correlations between a particular valence
electron and core electrons. It is very similar to the cor-
relation potential ˆΣ used for atoms with one external
electron (see, e.g. [6]).

There is also a two-electron operator ˆΣ2 which modiﬁes

Coulomb interaction between valence electrons:

Physical interpretation of ˆΣ2 is the screening of Coulomb
interaction between valence electrons by core electrons.
When number of valence electrons is greater than 2
there is also a three-body operator ˆΣ3 [16] and higher-
order many-body operators ˆΣ4, ˆΣ5, etc. . However, they
are usually very small and we will not consider them in
the present work.

The full set of diagrams for ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 in the sec-
ond order of MBPT is presented on Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5.
It contains the so-called subtraction diagrams which are
V HF , where Vcore is the potential
proportional to Vcore −
of the core electrons as in the eﬀective CI Hamiltonian
(1), V HF is the potential in which states of the core were
calculated. Note that subtraction diagrams vanish in the
V N −M approximation: Vcore = V HF .

The origin of the subtraction diagrams is clear from
the deﬁnition of the perturbation (residual interaction)
H0 where Hexact is the exact
operator U = Hexact −
Hamiltonian and H0 is the zero approximation Hamilto-
nian. If the ﬁeld of external electrons is included in H0 it

produces additional contributions which we call the sub-
traction diagrams. Thus, the potential V0 appears with
positive sign in the mean ﬁeld (and core wave functions),
and with negative sign in the residual interaction (and
subtraction diagrams).
If we calculate all correlations
exactly, to all orders, V0 must disappear in the ﬁnal re-
sult. In any ﬁnite order of the many-body perturbation
theory there are only partial cancellations; lower orders
of expansion in V0 are canceled out. Thus, the role of the
subtraction diagrams is to cancel the potential of specta-
tor valence electrons acting on the core electrons (eﬀect
of valence electrons on the core lines of the diagrams).
In other words, the subtraction diagrams guarantee that
in any given order of expansion in V0 the operators ˆΣ1
and ˆΣ2 are reduced to the results of V N −M approxima-
tion. Therefore, if the non-diagonal matrix elements of
V0 are small the V N −M approximation is the best zero
approximation since the calculations are much simpler
(no subtraction diagrams).

It is easy to see all these cancellations of V0 explicitly,
order by order in V0. Here one should remember that
change of the valence electron energies due to change of
the core Hartree-Fock potential (which formally has the
ﬁrst order in the Coulomb interaction) is actually can-
celed by the second order subtraction diagrams; contri-
bution of V0 into the core wave functions in the second
order diagrams is canceled by the third order subtraction
diagrams, etc.

IV. HIGHER ORDER TERMS IN ˆΣ

We have seen above that if the electrostatic potential
V0 created by valence electrons is nearly constant inside
the core then the V N −M approximation is equivalent to
the V N −M + V0 approximation, where V0 can have con-
tributions from all M valence electrons, or any fraction
on them or it can be just a model potential. The only
condition is that V0 is nearly constant inside the core.
This means that without any compromise on accuracy
we can do the calculation in the V N −M approximation
which is technically more simple. Another advantage of
using V N −M is that we have the same eﬀective Hamil-
tonian for any number of valence electrons from 1 to M .
Therefore we can do the calculations in a very similar
way for all corresponding ions as well as for a neutral
atom.

Eliminating subtracting diagrams in the V N −M ap-
proximation makes ˆΣ1 practically identical to the cor-
relation potential ˆΣ used for atoms with one external
electron. Therefore, we can try to improve the accu-
racy of calculations by including important higher order
terms into ˆΣ1 the same way as it was done in a num-
ber of calculations for alkali atoms (see, e.g. [7, 9]). We
include two dominating classes of higher order diagrams
into calculation of ˆΣ1. One is screening of the Coulomb
interaction between valence and core electrons by other
core electrons. Another is interaction between an elec-

tron excited from the core and a hole in the core created
by this excitation. Both classes of diagrams are included
in all orders (see, e.g. [7, 9] for details).

We use notation ˆΣ(∞)

for the all-order ˆΣ operator as
compared to ˆΣ(2)
for the second-order operator. The ef-
1
fect of inclusion of second and higher order correlations
can be illustrated by calculating of the energy levels of
Xe VIII. This ion has only one valence electron and cal-
culations for it can be done the same way as for other
single-valence electron atoms (see, e.g. [7]). Instead of di-
agonalizing the CI matrix we solve HF-like equations for
valence electrons in coordinate space, with ˆΣ1 included
in it:

(h1 + ˆΣ1 −

ǫ)ψ = 0.

(7)

Here single-electron Hamiltonian h1 is given by (2) while
1 or ˆΣ(∞)
ˆΣ1 can be either ˆΣ(2)
. If no ˆΣ1 is included then
eq. (7) gives HF energies and wave functions.

The results of calculations are presented in Table I and
compared with experiment. One can see systematic sig-
niﬁcant improvement of the results when ﬁrst ˆΣ(2)
and

then ˆΣ(∞)

are included.

We are now going to use the same ˆΣ(∞)

operator for
all ions from Xe VII to Xe II and for neutral xenon. For
all these ions which have more than one valence elec-
trons the ˆΣ2 operator should also be included.
In the
V N −M approximation the ˆΣ2 term is given by diagrams
on Fig. 4, and no subtraction diagrams are needed. To
include higher-order correlations into ˆΣ2 we use screen-
ing factors the same way as we do this for the exchange
diagrams of ˆΣ1 (Figs. 2.2 and 2.4) (see, e.g. [7]). To ex-
plain how screening factors are found and used we need
to go into more details on how the all-order correlation
operator ˆΣ(∞)
is calculated. We use Feynman diagram
technique to calculate direct diagrams (Fig. 2 1 and 3).
It allows us to include an inﬁnite chain of screening di-
agrams in all orders [7]. Application of the Feynman
diagram technique to exchange diagrams (Fig. 2 2 and 4)
is much more complicated [9]. On the other hand these
diagrams are usually an order of magnitude smaller than
direct diagrams. Therefore it makes sense to use an ap-
proximate method by introducing screening factors. We
assume that screening of Coulomb interaction between

(9)

The values of fk change very little from atom to atom
and the values presented above can be used for xenon.
This is supported by the results obtained for Xe VIII
(see Table I).

The eﬀect of ˆΣ2 on atomic energies is much smaller
than those of ˆΣ1. Therefore we can also treat higher-
order correlations in ˆΣ2 in an approximate way, via
screening factors, as we do this for exchange part of ˆΣ1.
We replace every Coulomb integral Qk on all diagrams
on Fig. 4 except diagram Fig. 4.1 by its screened values
fkQk where screened factors fk are taken as in (9). For
the diagram Fig. 4.1 only one of the Coulomb integrals
is replaced by its screened value. This is because this di-
agram can generate only one inﬁnite chain of loops rep-
resenting screening. Therefore, screening should by in-
cluded only once. This this very similar to the all-order
treatment of the direct diagram for ˆΣ1 (Fig. 2.1 and 2.3).
If this diagram is expressed in terms of screened Coulomb
interaction, only one of two Coulomb integrals should be
replaced by a screened one (see [7, 9] for details).

V. BASIS

There are two single-electron basis sets in this prob-
lem. One is used to calculate ˆΣ and other is used to
construct many-electron states of valence electrons for
the CI calculations.

In principle, it is possible to use the same basis for both
purposes and we did so in many of our earlier calcula-
tions [17, 22, 23, 24, 25]. The most convenient choice for

6

the basis is the basis consisting of single-electron states
calculated in the V N −M potential. We use B-spline tech-
nique to calculate the basis. Lower and upper compo-
nent of each basis set is expressed as linear combination
of 40 B-splines in the cavity of radius of 40aB. Expan-
sion coeﬃcients are found from the condition that the
basis states are the eigenstates of HF Hamiltonian (2)
with the V N −M potential. The advantages of this ap-
proach are many: core and valence states are orthogonal
automatically, the basis is reasonably complete and does
not depend on number of valence electrons. The latter
means in particular that if we want to change number
of valence electrons (e.g. to do calculation for another
ion) we don’t have to recalculate single and double elec-
tron matrix elements. The shortcoming of this approach
is rapid increase of the size of the CI matrix with the
number of valence electrons. Indeed, typical number of
single-electrons basis states needed to get saturation of
the basis is around 100. The number of ways, valence
electrons can be distributed over these 100 states grows
very fast with the number of valence electrons. For eight
electrons like for Xe I the matrix reaches unmanageable
size, even when some conﬁguration selection technique is
used.

In present work we use the basis described above only
for calculation of ˆΣ. For the CI calculations we use very
compact basis of HF states of corresponding ion or neu-
tral atom. For example, we perform HF calculations for
neutral Xe I in its ground state [Pb]5s25p6 in the V N
approximation and then use the 5s and 5p states as the
basis states for the CI calculations for Xe I in the V N −8
approximation. Other basis states like 6s, 6p, etc. are
obtained by removing one 5p electron from the atom and
calculating these states in the frozen ﬁeld of remaining
electrons. The states obtained this way are not orthog-
onal to the core which corresponds to the V N −8 poten-
tial. In the relativistic case the basis states for valence
electrons must also be orthogonal to the negative energy
states (positron states). Both conditions (orthogonal-
ity to the core and to the negative energy states) can
be achieved by projecting a basis state on the B-spline
states above the core:

Here summation goes over states above the core. Func-
v′
are more suitable for the CI calculations than
tions

states
because they don’t have admixture of the core

and negative energy states.

If more than one state of particular symmetry is in-
cluded into the basis (like, e.g. the 6p and 7p states for
Xe I) they also need to be orthogonalized to each other.
Full list of valence states for xenon and its ions used in
the calculations are presented in Table II. First column
shows an atom or ion, second column gives total number
of valence basis states, then states are listed together
with the conﬁgurations in which they were calculated.

Note that every state with l > 0 consists of two function,
e.g. 6p stands for 6p1/2 and 6p3/2, etc. Note also that the
number of basis states is always small, much smaller than
about 100 needed with the B-spline basis. This greatly
overweights an inconvenience of recalculating the basis
for every ion or atom.

VI. CALCULATIONS FOR XENON AND ITS
IONS

In this section we present calculations for xenon and
its ions. The whole calculation scheme consists of the
following steps (we use Xe I as an example):

1. HF for Xe IX, V N −8 potential is obtained.

2. Calculation of B-spline states in the V N −8 poten-

tial.

3. Calculation of ˆΣ1.

4. HF for Xe I, the 5s and 5p basis states are obtained.

5. Calculation of valence basis states.

6. Calculation of single and double-electron matrix el-

ements, including matrix elements of ˆΣ2.

7. Calculation and diagonalization of the CI matrix.

Ar ﬁrst glance this scheme doesn’t look very simple.
However, none of the steps listed above are very time
consuming or require large computer power. The most
time consuming step is calculation of ˆΣ ( ˆΣ1 in step 3 and
ˆΣ2 in step 6). An eﬃcient way of calculating both ˆΣ1 and
ˆΣ2 is presented in the appendix. The timescale to obtain
all results presented in this section while using a PC or
a laptop is one day.

Results for neutral xenon are presented in Table III
while results for six positive ions from Xe VII to Xe II
are presented in Tables IV, V, VI, VII,VIII and IX. For
neutral xenon (Table III) we study in detail the role of
core-valence correlations by including them in diﬀerent
approximations. The basis for valence states is kept the
same in all cases (see previous section for the description
of the basis). The approximations are

1. First, we present the results of the standard CI
method, with no core-valence correlations (the
“CI” column of Table III). Accuracy for the en-
ergies as compared to experimental values are not
very good. However the diﬀerence does not exceed
10% which is suﬃciently good for many applica-
tions. This is in spite of the fact that calculations
for neutral xenon were done with atomic core cor-
responding to highly ionized Xe IX. This is another
conﬁrmation that change in the core potential Vcore
from Xe I to Xe IX is very small.

2. Second-order ˆΣ(2)
is added to the eﬀective Hamilto-
1
nian (the “ ˆΣ(2)

are signiﬁcantly closer to the experiment but the
correction is too large. This is similar to what usu-
ally takes place with the second-order correlation
correction for atoms with one external electron.

4. Higher orders are included in ˆΣ1 while ˆΣ2 is not
included at all (the “ ˆΣ(∞)

of higher orders in ˆΣ1 is numerically close to the
eﬀect of ˆΣ2 as is evident from the comparison with
previous column. This coincidence is accidental.
5. Higher orders are included in ˆΣ1 while ˆΣ2 is in-
cluded in second order (the “ ˆΣ(∞)
2 ” column).
The results are improved but for many states the
correction is too large.

6. Higher orders are included in both ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 (the
“ ˆΣ(∞)” column). This is the most complete calcu-
lation we have in present work. Here we also in-
cluded calculated values of Land´e’s g-factors. The
g-factors are very useful for identiﬁcation of the
states, especially for atoms with dense spectrum
where calculations do not always reproduce the cor-
rect order of the levels.

The last column of Table III presents the diﬀerence be-
tween experimental and calculated energies where calcu-
lated energies correspond to the most complete calcula-
Ecalc. This diﬀerence does
not exceed 2% and should mostly be atributed to incom-
pleteness of the basis. Indeed, it is hard to expect that
the basis consisting of only 15 single-electron states (from
one to three in each partial wave from l = 0 to l = 3)
to be complete. Test calculations show that adding more
states to the basis do have some eﬀect on the energies
of the states. The eﬀect is larger for higher states. For
example, it is hard to expect any reasonable accuracy for
the states of the 5s25p56d conﬁguration without having
the 6d state in the basis. But adding the 6d state to the
basis also have some eﬀect on the lower 5s25p55d conﬁg-
uration. The detailed study of the ways to saturate the
basis goes beyond the scope of the present work.

Tables IV, V, VI, VII,VIII and IX. present our results
for xenon positive ions from Xe VII to Xe II. Only re-
sults obtained in the “best” approximation ( ˆΣ(∞)) are
included. Calculations for the ions start from point 4
in the scheme presented in the beginning of this section.
This is because ﬁrst 3 points are exactly the same as for
neutral xenon. Note that one of the most time consum-
ing steps, calculation of ˆΣ1, doesn’t need to be repeated.
Basis states for valence electrons used in the CI calcula-
tions are described in previous section (see Table II). We

use shorter basis for the ions because we calculate only
lowest states. To go up in the spectrum we would need
to extend the basis similar to what is done for Xe I. The
analysis of the data in Tables IV, V, VI, VII,VIII and IX.
show that the accuracy is generally very good in spite of
very short basis.

For the Xe III ion we also included calculations which
use the basis states of the Xe IV ion (column E(N
1)
of Table VIII). The purpose of these calculations will be
explained in the negative ions section below.

VII. SOME SPECIAL CASES

A. Highly excited states

One of the additional advantages of the use of V N ba-
sis for valence states is the possibility to study highly
excited states with a very short basis. To get to a highly
excited state with an universal basis like B-splines one
has to calculate all states of the same parity and total
momentum J which are below of the state of interest.
Also, the completeness of the basis deteriorates rapidly
while going higher in the spectrum. V N basis is free
from these problems. To calculate highly excited states
of a particular conﬁguration it is suﬃcient to include into
single-electron basis for valence states only states which
correspond to this conﬁguration. For example, the states

of the 5s25p58s of Xe I can be calculated with good ac-
curacy with only four states in the basis: 5s, 5p1/2, 5p3/2

same parity and total momentum J but we can easily
get rid of them by not including corresponding single-
electron states into the basis.

ion. At ﬁrst glance the answer is no because we use V N
states for the basis and negative ions are not bound in
the V N approximation. However, we may consider the
following question: what is going to happen if we add one
more electron to the CI calculations for a neutral atom,
when basis corresponds to the neutral atom?

−

For atoms like xenon, which don’t form negative ions,
it makes more sense to consider more general question:
1 valence elec-
can a basis calculated for a system of N
trons be used to calculate many electron states of a sys-
tem of N electrons? This can be easily checked. Take,
for example, the Xe IV ion and add one more electron
in the CI calculations to get the states of Xe III. We’ve
done this without adding any new states into the basis.
Results are presented in the last column of Table VIII.
We can see that the results for the ion with the basis of
the other ion are almost as good as with its own basis.
Accuracy is a bit lower which is a natural consequence
of the worsening of the basis. Adding more states to the
basis would most certainly improve the results.

This ﬁndings are not very surprising since we know
that any basis set can be used in the CI calculations.
For example, in Ref. [23] calculations for neutral Kr were
performed with the basis corresponding to Kr IX! The
only question is how many states we need to include to
get reasonable results. It turns out that at least in the
case of just one more electron there is no need to greatly
increase the basis. This means that we can also calculate
states of negative ions by using basis states of a neutral
atom.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we present a method of calculation for
many-electron atoms with open shells which is both ac-
curate and very eﬃcient. The method is based on the
so called V N −M approximation in which calculations
start from the highly charged ion with all valence elec-
trons removed. High accuracy is achieved by inclusion of
core-valence correlations by means of MBPT. Dominat-
ing chains of higher order diagrams are included in all
orders. High eﬃciency of the method is mostly due to
the compact V N basis set for the states of valence elec-
trons. The method is expected to work well for atoms in
which valence electrons form a separate shell (deﬁned by
the principal quantum number). This is usually the case

if valence electrons in the atomic ground state occupy s
and/or p states. This covers roughly half of the periodic
table of elements. Calculations for xenon and its ions
illustrate the use of the method.

where r< = min(r, r′) and r> = max(r, r′). We will also
need a ρ function:

ρjl(r) = fj(r)fl(r) + α2gj(r)gl(r)).

APPENDIX A: EFFICIENT WAY OF
CALCULATING ˆΣ

The correlation correction operator ˆΣ1 is deﬁned in
such are way that its overage value over a wave function
of a valence electron is the correlation correction to the
energy of this electron:

ˆΣ1|
v

r (cid:18)

fn(r)Ω(n)jlm
iαgn(r) ˜Ω(n)jlm (cid:19)

(A2)

Then the expression (A1) becomes

Note factors α2 and α4 in all terms except the ﬁrst one.
These factors make corresponding contributions to be
very small. Therefore we don’t usually include them.
Only Σf f will be considered in this appendix and we will
omit the indexes.

Our typical coordinate grid consists of about 1000 points.
Usually all of them are used to calculate Y -functions
(A4). However, there is no need to keep all points for
the Y and ρ-functions for consequent calculations.
It
turns out that very little lose of accuracy is caused by
the use of a subset of points deﬁned as every 4th point
in the interval

1/Z

r

Rcore.

By cutting oﬀ the point on short and large distances and
using only every 4th point in between we reduce the num-
ber of points by an order of magnitude. Then, Coulomb
integrals are calculated in an extremely eﬃcient way

use of all points.

1. Second-order ˆΣ

Good eﬃciency in calculating of ˆΣ is achieved by di-

viding the calculations into two steps:

1. First, all relevant Coulomb Y functions are calcu-

lated and stored on disk.

2. Then, Σ is calculated using stored Y -functions.

Here c1, c2, c3, c4 are angular coeﬃcients. Expres-
sions for them can be found elsewhere [16]. Formulas
(A7),(A8),(A9),(A10), correspond to diagrams 1,2,3,4 on
Fig. 2. ˆΣ1 is a matrix of size µ
100 in coordinate space.
Matrix elements of ˆΣ1 are calculated by

Note that we use a two-step procedure to calculate matrix
elements of ˆΣ1. First, ˆΣ1 matrix which is independent
on valence functions is calculated, then matrix elements
of ˆΣ1 are calculated. To use the same approach for ˆΣ2 is

(A4)

12

impractical. As can be seen from Fig. 4 to make ˆΣ2 in-
dependent on valence states one would have to make ma-
trices of dimensions 2, 3 and 4. Therefore we just calcu-
late matrix elements of ˆΣ2 via Coulomb integrals. Corre-
sponding expressions can be found in Ref. [16]. Coulomb
integrals are calculated as in (A6).

The details of calculation of ˆΣ(∞)
can be found else-
where [7, 9]. Here we only want to mention that op-
erators ˜Π, Π, G and Q are matrices of size µ
100 in
≈
coordinate space. Therefore calculation of ˆΣ(∞)
involves
manipulation of matrices of relatively small size. If we
also recall that ˆΣ1 does not depend on valence states and
needs to be calculated only once then the eﬃciency of its
calculation is quiet satisfactory.

Higher-order correlations in exchange diagrams for ˆΣ1
(diagrams 2 and 4 on Fig. 2) and for all diagrams for
ˆΣ2 are included via screening factors as explained in the
text.

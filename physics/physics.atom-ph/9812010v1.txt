Abstract. Via a non–perturbative method we study the population dynamics
and photoelectron spectra of Cs atoms subject to intense chirped laser pulses,
with gaussian beams. We include above threshold ionization spectral peaks. The
frequency of the laser is near resonance with the 6s-7p transition. Dominant couplings
are included exactly, weaker ones accounted for perturbatively. We calculate the
relevant transition matrix elements,
including spin–orbit coupling. The pulse is
taken to be a hyperbolic secant in time and the chirping a hyperbolic tangent. This
choice allows the equations of motions for the probability amplitudes to be solved
analytically as a series expansion in the variable u = (tanh(πt/τ ) + 1)/2, where τ
is a measure of the pulse length. We ﬁnd that the chirping changes the ionization
dynamics and the photoelectron spectra noticeably, especially for longer pulses of
the order of 104 a.u. The peaks shift and change in height, and interference eﬀects
between the 7p levels are enhanced or diminished according to the amount of chirping
and its sign. The integrated ionization probability is not strongly aﬀected.

Introduction

The ionization of an atom by a pulse of laser radiation is a fundamental process which
is only well understood in certain regions of intensity, frequency and pulse length. The
regime which is best understood is when perturbation theory may be applied, that is
where the intensity is very low, the frequency not too low, and the pulse very long
and constant or quasi constant in electric ﬁeld amplitude (see e.g. [1]). In particular,
the amplitude of the initial state is approximately equal to one for the entire duration
of the process.

Since the intensity of the radiation ﬁeld is nowadays often comparable with the
internal ﬁeld of the atom, perturbation theory is inadequate. Perturbation theory
also breaks down at lower intensities if the ﬁeld frequency is close to a resonance,
or if saturation occurs. Thus, the applicability of lowest–order theory is limited to
non–resonant absorption. Resonance eﬀects involving intermediate states can make
the picture much more complicated and must be described by a theory which allows
for strong signals.

Another degree of complexity appears when the length of the pulse is shortened
(less than 10−13 s) : the peaks shift, widen and develop substructures. For example
the energies of the atomic states shift by amounts, which, to the ﬁrst non–vanishing
order, are proportional to the intensity of the laser ﬁeld (A.C. Stark eﬀect). Thus
an intermediate atomic level can shift in such a way that it comes into resonance at
certain times during the laser pulse.

The above processes have been approached theoretically in a few diﬀerent ways
and described in diﬀerent, not always compatible languages, often corresponding to
non–identical experimental situations.

Some calculations are based on the application of Floquet theory

[2, 3], a
semiclassical approach which takes advantage of the temporal periodicity of the
Hamiltonian.

Other theories are based on the Keldysh–Faisal–Reiss (KFR) model [4, 5].
In
an approximation originally due to Keldysh and developed by Reiss, the exact ﬁnal
state of the electron is replaced by solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for a free
electron in a laser ﬁeld. The Keldysh approximation may be quite successful if the
atomic potential is of very short range, at least for the position of spectral peaks.
However KFR treatments have not fared particularly well in quantitative comparisons
with experiments speciﬁcally designed to test their predictions regarding ATI electron
spectra [6].

Another type of method is the essential states approach [7], which focuses on
continuum–continuum interactions. States are called “essential” if they are populated
during the entire process of ATI. Such a theory allows simple analytical solutions,
provided some assumptions are made. These include the rotating wave approximation,
the treatment of transitions into the continuum from the ground state as a direct non–
resonant multiphoton process, and the assumption that all transition matrix elements
between states belonging to diﬀerent continua have one of several simple analytic
forms.

In a number of studies, the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation has been solved
by direct numerical integration for model atoms. Studies have been done both on
one–dimensional atoms (e.g.
[8, 9]), and more realistic models [10], using various
approximations. One of the limitations of this hard numerical approach is the time
required for these simulations and attendant lack of ﬂexibility. For example the space–
temporal shape of the laser beam can only be roughly taken into account. This
approach does not oﬀer great insight into the physics, but since the experimental
results can vary greatly even for very similar experiments, these results can be looked
at as numerical experiments against which one can further test model theories.

The above–mentioned models usually represent only some important features of
real systems and make simplifying assumptions. Many studies are done for constant
ﬁelds, or cannot describe processes of resonant–enhanced multiphoton ionization.
The same can be said about numerical computations, very sophisticated and time
consuming even for one–dimensional atoms. They only partially contribute to a full
understanding of the processes.

Due to the complexities involved in the dynamics of the interaction of an atom
with strong short laser pulses, it is useful to try to unveil such dynamics using a model
which is both realistic and oﬀers a simple physical interpretation.

We report on a model of the system which is solvable, at least partially, by
analytical methods, since these generally allow greater insight than a direct numerical
integration. This also reduces the computer eﬀort per parameter set, thus permitting
the integration over spatial proﬁles, where many repetitions are needed.

The work is performed in the semiclassical approximation which has given very
good results in the past and is justiﬁed given the high intensity of the radiation ﬁeld.
Furthermore the electric dipole approximation is indeed almost always valid at optical
frequencies.

A starting point is the Rosen–Zener problem [11, 12, 13]. In this problem a two–

3

level atom is subject to a pulse whose amplitude that varies in time as a hyperbolic
secant. Such problem can be solved analytically via a transformation of the time
variable t to the “compressed time” u = (tanh(πt/τ ) + 1)/2. The solutions are
hypergeometric functions.

Our model can be regarded as an extension of the basic Rosen–Zener problem to
an atom with more that two active levels, including coupling to the continuum, to
model ATI, and chirping of the laser.

By using an expansion of the wave function in the amplitudes of atomic states
that are most relevant to the dynamics of the system, one obtains a simpliﬁcation
that allows one to get a clearer picture of what is going on during the interaction.
These levels are those most strongly coupled to the ground state, and others coupled
to that group. In other words, we use a truncated spectral representation of the wave
function, which considers only the atomic states most strongly mixed with the ground
state and includes the contribution of the remaining levels approximately.

In the application of the method we focus on the cesium atom, both because
it is advantageous theoretically, since many of the atomic parameters involved have
already been calculated in the literature, and it is also an element which is accessbile
to experimental analysis.

We are interested in studying ATI, thus the coupling of the bound states to the
continua corresponding to the second ionization peak will also be included. We also
include frequency chirping in the laser pulse and account for a Gaussian spatial shape.
Section 2 introduces the model for the physical system under study and the method
of solution of the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation is discussed. In section 3 the
atomic and laser parameters are characterized. The results of the simulations are
presented in section 4 and the conclusions in section 5.

2. Alkali Atoms in Strong Pulsed Resonant Laser Radiation

In this section we describe the theoretical model and the solutions of the corresponding
equations of motion. Atomic units are used throughout this article, that is, one takes
e = m = ¯h = 1 a.u.

2.1. The Model

The system under study consists of an alkali atom, which has a single active electron,
interacting with pulsed laser radiation. The electron wave function is expanded in the
basis of unperturbed energy eigenstates. To simplify the notation the atomic levels
are labeled with a single index, which stands for the standard set of quantum numbers
completely identifying the electron state. In this notation the electron wave function
can be written as

Ψ(t) >=

cn(t) exp(

n >
iωnt)
|

−

Xn

(1)

As noted in the introduction, we make the dipole approximation.

where the sum spans the bound states and includes an integration over the continuum.
In addition,
the work is done in the length gauge because it can be argued that it gives a
better approximation than the velocity gauge when a truncated basis is used to
represent the electronic wave function.
If the unperturbed potentials are velocity–
independent, the momentum matrix elements are related to the dipole matrix elements

more slowly with the energy diﬀerence than do the length ones. Then, calculating
multiphoton transition amplitudes, in the sum over intermediate states, the velocity
gauge weighs states more distant in energy more than the length gauge does and the
sum converges more slowly. Thus, a truncated basis using states close to resonance is
a better approximation in the length gauge. The Hamiltonian in length gauge is given
by

H = H0 + E

r

·

where H0 is the unperturbed atomic Hamiltonian.
The incident laser ﬁeld can be written as

(t) = 2E(t) cos(Ωt + α(t))

E

where E represents the pulse shape and α the frequency chirping,
a time-
dependence of the optical frequency. Experimentally this eﬀect usually accompanies
the creation of short laser pulses, and to the best of our knowledge, has not been
included in previous work on ionization.

i.e.

We consider photoionization processes in which the laser frequency is nearly
resonant with the transition between the ground and some excited levels, so that
ionization is possible from the excited states through the absorption of one photon.
Speciﬁcally we will study cesium subject to laser light in resonance with the 6s–7p
transition. The level scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

If the frequency of the light is close to resonance for the transition between the
ground state and some excited levels, the dynamics of the electron will be dominated
by the corresponding contributions of such levels. In addition, other levels should be
retained if, although nonresonant, they have a very strong coupling with the ground
state. We call all these states “relevant” states and solve for their eﬀect exactly.
In addition we can correct for the contribution of the further atomic levels in a
perturbative way, calculating the energy shifts they induce on the relevant states. We
use the rotating wave approximation, since we are interested in optical frequencies, a
regime where such an approximation is typically excellent.

We make the Weisskopf–Wigner approximation so that the coupling between the
bound states and the continuum levels is modeled by decay coeﬃcients and level shifts.
This can be done also for the processes corresponding to excess photon absorption (i.e.
ATI).

We now give an outline of the derivation of the equations of motion for the
probability amplitude using the afore mentioned approximations. Using Eqs.(1) and
(2) and assuming the electric ﬁeld to be polarized in the ˆz direction, the time–
dependent Schr¨odinger equation yields:

The sum is over the relevant states. We then substitute the above expression into
the equation of motion for the relevant state m and perform the time integration
by parts, we get a term containing a time derivative which we can neglect in the
Weisskopf–Wigner approximation.

Further we neglect terms containing factors such as exp(2iΩt). We then
assume that Ω

all other levels and also the non–resonant contribution from the same level, which
provides a correction to the rotating wave approximation. For an excited level j, the

In the above equations we consider only the lowest order terms in the ﬁeld, i.e.
cross terms corresponding to the absorption of one photon from an excited state
and re–emission to a diﬀerent one are neglected. A few test runs have shown this
contribution to be negligible. In the same manner, we neglect the eﬀect of the decay
rate to the second continuum on the equations of motion for the excited bound states.
One could readily allow for this eﬀect, but it proves to be negligible for the conditions
we encounter. We also neglect the process involving absorption of two photons from
an excited state and re–emission of one photon to a continuum state.

While the equations can be generalized to any number of excess photons absorbed,

we will consider only the ﬁrst two peaks.

To enable the analysis to be carried out in closed form, we chose a ﬁeld envelope
in the shape of a hyperbolic secant and a frequency chirp proportional to a hyperbolic

These results have been implemented both with Mathematica and Fortran programs.
Mathematica allows an arbitrary amount of precision, but it is about a hundred times
slower than the Fortran version. For ﬁelds up to 10−5 atomic units and pulse lengths
up to 104 atomic units Fortran’s double precision proved to yield the same results as

3. Atomic and Laser Parameters

The model atom is characterized by several coupling and decay constants and level
shifts, which need to be evaluated. Coeﬃcients for one–photon transitions are given
by the matrix elements κf i =< f
i > and the Stark–shift parameters λj by Eq.(9)
|
and (10). The two–photon coupling between the excited states and the continuum is
given by χf i in Eq.(27). For the case of the cesium atom the above parameters are
already available in the literature (see e.g. [13]) except for the two–photon couplings
above threshold.

z
|

We choose the laser ﬁeld to be linearly polarized in the z direction and of frequency
such that we can model this problem accurately with the retention of only four excited
states, those of the 6p and the 7p doublets. The 7p states are quasi resonant, while
the 6s-6p oscillator strengths are orders of magnitude larger than any other coupling
to the ground state. Thus, retaining the 6p doublet takes non resonant ionization
into account with negligible error. The level scheme is shown in Fig. 1. We take the
ground state energy to be equal to zero. The ionization potential of cesium is 3.89 eV.
In Table 1, we list the energy levels and Stark shift coeﬃcients of the relevant

states of cesium.

The decay parameters were calculated in [13] by the method developed by Burgess
and Seaton [14], the matrix elements coupling of the bound states were calculated
using the quantum defect method and the non resonant couplings were calculated using
data found in Stone [15]. In the present work we also need the coupling coeﬃcients
between the bound states and the continua associated with the second ionization.
This corresponds to the absorption of 2 photons from the excited states, when the
absorption of 1 photon is permitted (that is, we have “above threshold ionization”).

3.1. Calculation of the coupling to ATI channels

One needs to evaluate terms like :

The sum spans all intermediate bound and continuum states. Here Ω is the laser
frequency and ωi is the energy of the initial bound state. The η in the denominator
) the denominator vanishes when
was included because above threshold (Ω >
ωn = ωi + Ω. The small imaginary part prescribes the correct boundary conditions
for a ﬁeld adiabatically turned on in the remote past.

Several methods have been developed to calculate transition amplitudes involving
inﬁnite sums over intermediate states. For alkali atoms, quantum defect theory and

model potentials have been used as weel as truncated summations over a ﬁnite number
of states. Most calculations have taken the laser frequency to be below threshold.

We used a method based on the solution of an Inhomogeneous Diﬀerential Equation
(IDE), which is equivalent to performing the sums over the entire spectrum of bound
and continuum intermediate states. In this formulation we have

This method, which is based on numerical computations in the framework of the
central ﬁeld approximation has a wider range of applicability than the afore mentioned
analytical methods, and also leads to accurate results.

The central potential we used is calculated in [16] using the Hartree–Fock–Slater

i.e. n= 6, l=0, j=1/2, m=1/2. Since the interaction z conserves the spin and ml, m
will always be equal to +1/2 and we will drop it in subsequent formulas.

After the absorption of one photon from the ground state, the electron will be in
a state p1/2 or p3/2. Since we will consider laser frequencies close to the transition

10

frequency between the ground state and the 7p’s states, our atomic model will consider
these states explicitly, and as noted, also the 6p’s, because their coupling to the ground
state is very large. Thus, the initial state for the transition to the continuum via the
rR(r), then
absorption of 2 photons can be any of the 6p’s or 7p’s states. Let P (r)

First we solve the unperturbed Schr¨odinger equation to calculate the initial bound
state which enters in the inhomogeneous term of Eq.(35). This is done through a
modiﬁcation of Herman and Skillman’s code [16] to include spin orbit interaction.

We solve Eq.(35) numerically using Numerov’s method (see e.g. [18]) integrating
outward from the origin. The boundary conditions require the solution to be zero
at the origin and to be an outgoing wave for large r. We start the integration using
a Taylor expansion around the origin.
In general the solution obtained does not
satisfy the boundary conditions at inﬁnity, so we add a solution of the homogeneous
equation such that the combination satisﬁes the boundary conditions at inﬁnity.
The coeﬃcients of the combination are determined using the asymptotic expansion
of Coulomb functions.

3.2. Transition Amplitudes for Cesium and Laser Parameters

By virtue of the angular momentum selection rules, the 6s ground state couples to
the 6p and 7p states, while the p states couple via one–photon absorption to the s
and d continuum channels and to the p and f continuum channels via two–photon
absorption. Fig. 2 presents a diagram of the various ionization channels considered in
this study and Tabs. 2, 3 and 4 give the corresponding coeﬃcients calculated with the
methods described in the previous section.

In this work we are interested in short laser pulses. After the ﬁrst successful
generation of short optical pulses via mode locking with Nd:glass in the sixties, steady
progress in generating shorter and shorter pulses was achieved. For a review, see for
example [20].

Nowadays the shortest pulses generated directly from a laser can be achieved with
Ti:sapphire lasers. These lasers can be used to achieve 10−14 s pulse generation [21]
by using nonlinear eﬀects which induce frequency chirps. Complete compensation of
the chirp is not possible with a ﬁnite number of linear optical elements.

With these experimental considerations in mind, we will consider laser pulses
of durations in the 25-250 fs range, with frequency almost on resonance with the
6s-7p transition. The frequency chirping induced by the compression mechanisms,
is characterized by a chirp parameter β of the order of π/τ . The parameters
characterizing the laser beam are thus frequency, chirp parameter and intensity. The
temporal dependence of the pulse is given by Eqs.(2.3) and (2.16). We will consider
intensities in the range 10−7
104a.u., with chirp
parameters β

10−4a.u., and pulse lengths of 103

π/τ .

Ionization Dynamics of Cesium

In this section, the method described in section 2 is applied to the case of cesium,
using the atomic and laser parameters calculated and listed in section 3. We will
consider three diﬀerent regimes according to the intensity of the laser beam and the
1017 W/cm2 –
case of Gaussian beams. The ‘atomic’ unit of intensity here is 1.4
four times the unit used by many other authors.

×

4.1. Weak Field Limit

The spectrum for weak ﬁelds (in the adiabatic limit) is usually a single peak at an
energy twice the photon energy above the ground state. In fact, for this case, one
expects the ﬁnal energy of the photoelectron to consist of the Fourier distribution of
the pulse squared at an energy consistent with energy conservation. However, with
relatively short, weak pulses tuned between the doublet, a double peak structure is
found in the s1/2 or d3/2 continuum channels but not in the d5/2 channel. This
structure was ﬁrst reported in [13] and attributed to the interference between the
two diﬀerent ionization paths to the afore mentioned channels, which results in the
suppression of the central peak. However the d5/2 channels can be reached only in one
way, through the p3/2 excited states and thus cannot show any interference eﬀects.

|

∆1jτ
|

Adler et al. [13] found that one sees a pair of peaks only when the condition
1 <
< 10 is roughly true. This behavior is consistent with the interpretation
of such structure as a manifestation of destructive interference between the 7p levels,
when the laser is tuned to the middle of the doublet. For very short pulses, the
incident radiation’s spectrum covers a wider range of frequencies and the detuning
is less signiﬁcant so that the 7p’s are practically a new single state and the doublet
disappears (see Fig. 3). For longer pulses, the central peak forms again and hides the
side peaks, which are much smaller. The central peak is about at frequency ω1 + 2Ω,
while the two side peaks at ω4 + Ω and ω5 + Ω. The relative heights are correlated
with the average populations of the 7P levels during the pulse.

In Fig. 4 we show the spectra of the S1/2 channel and the the spectra corresponding

13

to the contribution from the 7p states separately, i.e. with no inteference. One can
see here that each 7p state contributes to one of the side peaks. The central peak is
not resolved, being very close to the side peaks. If there were no interference eﬀects
we would not have the dip between the two side peaks. The existence of two peaks is
not due do oscillations in the populations, since we ﬁnd that these do not occur for
the intensities we are considering here, as can be seen for example in Fig. 7.

In the ATI peak the double peak structure is usually absent, in fact the mediation
of several channels to the ﬁrst continuum, makes interference eﬀects less likely to
occur. For some particular frequencies there is still some structure present in the P3/2
channel, which is the channel receiving contributions from all ﬁrst peak channels. See
Fig. 5, where we plot ATI spectra for the P channels for diﬀerent pulse lengths. As
for the two–photon peaks, also here the structures are washed out for shorter pulses.
In general the ATI peaks are at frequency ω1 + 3Ω and have a bandwidth larger than
that of the ω1 + 2Ω peaks. Infact they entail the Fourier transform of the ﬁeld pulse
to the third power, which has a smaller width (in time) than the square of the pulse.
We note that the broadening of the ATI peaks was reported in the experimental
results reported in 1992 by Nicklich et al in [22]. The calculation described by these
authors did not predict broadening of the higher peaks, however, although their spectra
did contain the oscillations similar to those in the experiment, while those oscillations
are absent from our work.

The double peak structure is heavily inﬂuenced by the presence of chirping in the
laser light, especially for the longer pulses in the above range. Varying the strength
and the sign of the chirping changes the absolute and relative height of the peaks, see
Fig. 6. In fact, the height of the peaks is determined by the amplitudes of the excited
states and their phase relationship, which are inﬂuenced by a kind of self–induced
phase modulation. Thus imposing external phase modulation (through chirping) on
these can strongly inﬂuence the ionization probability.

The evolution of the population of the bound states also changes appreciably with
chirping for the 7p levels which are quasi–resonant with the laser radiation. The 6p
levels are only slightly aﬀected (see Fig. 7). Infact the 6p’s are oﬀ–resonance and
their populations follow the ﬁeld adiabatically. In addition the relative height of the
side peaks is related to the amount of population in the corresponding level. The sign
of the chirping determines which levels will have a bigger average population during
the pulse and thus the height of the spectral peak. With our conventions a positive
chirp corresponds to a pulse whose instantaneous frequency is lower than the carrier
frequency at the beginning of the pulse and increases to a value greater than the carrier
frequency in the second half of the pulse. Thus the 7p1/2 is closer to resonance at the
beginning of the pulse and starts becoming populated earlier in the pulse. The 7p3/2
on the contrary becomes populated at a higher rate later during the pulse, when it
gets closer to resonance. Thus its average population during the pulse is lower than
in the case of chirp free light. The situation is reversed for negative chirping.

4.2. Strong Field Limit

In the previous section we observed that the double peak structure disappears for
short pulses. However, Adler et al. [23] have shown that when the pulse is short and
the intensity of the beam increased, the spectra again contain a multipeak structure,
which is also present when the laser frequency is tuned outside the doublet. Multiple
peaks can appear also in the D5/2 channel. We can see this in Fig. 8, where we plot

14

the channel D3/2 spectra for diﬀerent intensities. Increasing the laser intensity we see
a multipeak structure emerge, at the same time the populations also start showing
oscillations, see Fig. 9.

As noted in the previous subsection, this result conﬁrms that other mechanisms
such as Rabi oscillations and Stark shifts play a role in the production of the multipeak
structure in strong ﬁelds.

As in the case of weak ﬁelds, for such short pulses, the inﬂuence of chirping
is minimal in the second continuum peaks, but it induces visible changes in the
population dynamics and the relative peak heights of the doublet.

For long pulses, the chirping causes dramatic changes in the population dynamics
and in the spectra of the threshold peaks, see Figs. 10, 11. The ATI peaks are instead
not strongly aﬀected as one expects because of the larger linewidth and general lack
of structure, as shown in Fig. 12. It appears that chirping enhances or quenches the
oscillations in the populations depending if it is an up–chirp or a down–chirp, while
the frequency of the oscillation remains the same.

4.3. Gaussian Beams

In actual experiments the laser beam incident upon the atomic sample has an intensity
spatial proﬁle, so that the peak ﬁeld seen by each bound system is a function of its
distance from the axis.
In weak ﬁelds this is not important, since the intensity is
merely an overall factor. This is not the case in strong ﬁelds, however. Both the
total ionization and the electron energy distribution become complicated functions of
the optical ﬁeld strength, as for example, in Fig. 8 in which we see a second peak
developing in the D3/2 channel with increasing intensity.

If the intensity of the ﬁeld is weak enough to allow the neglect of depletion of the
ground state and coupling between the excited states through multiple transition to
the ground state and back, then none excited states is aﬀected by the existence of the
other ones. In this limit the solution of each bound state amplitude takes the form
of the Rosen–Zener solution (see for example [12] and [11]) for a two–level system in
which all energy shifts have been neglected. The spectra produced by this expression
are identical to those produced by the exact result for weak laser intensities.

We examine for what intensities and pulse lengths perturbation theory breaks
down. The evolution of the bound states start to deviate from the typical behavior
10−3
at weak ﬁelds when the peak intensity and pulse length are such that Imaxτ
a.u., for which nonlinear eﬀects start to show. This onset of nonlinear eﬀects seems
to be approximately independent of chirping.

≈

In the perturbative regime, the total ionization is proportional to the square of

the intensity, since the dominant process is two–photon absorption.

The total ionization probability is not very sensitive to the presence of chirping,
(Fig. 13). There is in general a small increase in the ionization rate, which can be
attributed to the widening of the pulse bandwidth from the frequency chirp. The
scaling parameter is 2Imaxτ /π and the total ionization is practically the same when
the length of the pulse or the current I is changed maintaining the scaling parameter
constant.

In the ﬁgures we show the evolutions of the populations and the spectra as a

function of the distance from the center of the laser beam.

Figs. 14 show the total ionization probability and the excited state population
after the passage of the pulse, as a function of the distance from the center of the

15

beam. A curve showing the Gaussian shape of the beam spatial proﬁle is shown for
reference. We ﬁnd that in general the total ionization probability roughly follows the
intensity proﬁle of the laser beam, while the population of the excited states after
the passage of the pulse shows an oscillatory dependence on the laser peak intensity
at the location of the atom. Looking at the temporal evolution of the excited states
populations one can see that the gradual change is due to the change in the Rabi
frequency and the number of oscillations the populations can do during the pulse. As
an illustration in Figs. 15 and we show the population of the 7p3/2 state as a function
of the distance from the center of the laser beam without chirping and with chirping.
The distance is normalized such that the FWHM of the beam is unity with the laser
parameters given in the ﬁgure caption. The eﬀect of chirping is mainly to change the
height of the oscillations, a chirping of the opposite sign would ﬂatten out the surface
of the plot.
In Fig. 16 and we show the spectra for the s1/2 channel for the same
set of parameters as Figs. 15 respectively. The presence of chirping here changes the
shape and heights of the peaks. One can see that for this intensity and frequency the
spectra does not depend in a monotonic way on the intensity. The ﬁnal spectra will
be a spatial average of all these contributions and the ﬁnal population of the bound
states will also change with position. Then in Fig. 17 we show a comparison between
the spatially averaged spectra and the spectra at the peak intensity.

5. Conclusion

The goal of this work was to model the dynamics of an atom with a ﬁnite number of
active levels interacting with short pulse of strong laser light using a non-perturbative
approach in the dominant states.
It was hoped to strike a balance between the
competing needs of realism and numerical simplicity, extending prior analysis to the
case of ATI and a “chirped” pulse.

As was done in prior work, we assumed only a few active levels whose coupling
to other states was taken into account by means of time–dependent level shifts and
decay rates. By assuming a hyperbolic secant pulse shape for the amplitude of the
ﬁeld, and a related form for the frequency modulation, we were able to extend the
analytically solvable problem previously reported to the present case. The ATI was
accounted for by means of an eﬀective operator, whose coupling strength was obtained
from the solution of an in- homogeneous Schr¨odinger equation.

The model was applied to the cesium atom for light nearly resonant with transitions
between the 6s ground state and 7p excited doublet. Coupling to the 6p doublet is
also included explicitly, since, even though its frequency is far from resonance, the
interaction matrix element is very large. The approach could be further extended
to include more atomic levels and a larger number of ATI peaks. Allowance for the
temporal proﬁle of the laser beam was made, and the dynamics of the excited state
populations and spectra of the ejected electrons were eﬃciently calculated.

We found that chirping as a great inﬂuence on the dynamics of the quasi- resonant
states, but much less of an eﬀect on the oﬀ resonant states. This transpires because the
chirping causes much less of a fractional change in the detuning of the nonresonant
In fact, it appears that the dominant part of the change produced in the
states.
nonresonant amplitudes by the chirping is due to the modiﬁcation in the ground state
amplitude cause by the resonant intermediate couplings.

The eﬀect of chirping is more pronounced for longer pulses. In this case, the pulse
has a smaller linewidth the the fractional change due to the chirping is relatively more

16

prominent.

Some of the spectral features, such as double peaks, can change drastically with
the chirpings. Those eﬀects in weak ﬁelds are due to the interference between the
phases of the various atomic amplitudes when the laser is tuned between resonances,
and is very sensitive to time dependent frequency shifrts. The interference is enhanced
or suppressed depending on the sign and magnitude of the chirp.

The structure of the spectral peaks is quite sensitive to the length of the pulse.
The doublet structure disappears for short pulses. The shorter pulses have a broader
frequency spectrum, over which the populations dynamics are averaged, thus washing
out the deleicate interference eﬀect due to phase modulation.

It is interesting to note that the ATI peaks lack the structure of the principal two–
photon peaks, even though both types are generated through the same quasi–resonant
intermediate states. This appears to result from the following considerations. The
weak–ﬁeld structure in the the two photon case stems from the interference between
the p1/2 and p3/2 amplitudes in a case when they are tending to cancel, so that
the overall transition probability is small. In the three–photon peak, there are more
channels, so that the net probability is dominated by the contributions that are not
supressed by destructive in- terference.

However, according to our calculations, the three-photon peak is broader than
the two photon by about a factor two. This can be understood in terms of the
Fourier transforms of the eﬀective operator coupling the intermediate states to the
respective continua. For two photon ionization, that operator is just the transform of
the hyperbolic secant, while for the ATI peak, it is the transform of the square of the
hyperbolic secant, which is broader in frequency space.

We note that chirping aﬀects not only the shape of the photoelectron structure ,
but also the total ionization probability, perhaps by making more frquencies available
for ionization.

We also studied the eﬀect of spatial dependence of the laser beam proﬁle on the
quantities accessible by experiment. The total ionization, the spectra and the residual
population show deviations from perturbative behaviour which should be taken into
account performing a spatial average, to ﬁnd the measured quantity. The eﬀects
of a gaussian beam proﬁle was discussed in [24] for the case of a one–dimensional
atomic model. There the concurrence of signiﬁcant amounts of ionization and
residual excited–state populations is attributed to the fact that atoms are subjected
to diﬀerent peak intensities depending on position, also oscillations in the residual
excited populations are found as a function of intensity.

As discussed previously we also ﬁnd that for a certain range of intensities and
pulse lengths, the total ionization is proportional to the product of peak intensity
and pulse length. This seems to imply that the total ionization is behaving like a
one–photon absorption out of the p states, and that this step is roughly given by ﬁrst
order perturbation theory.

Assuming a Gaussian beam, the space averaged spectra can show qualitatively
diﬀerent features from the spectra corresponding to the peak intensity. In fact some
of the spectral features are very sensitive to the peak intensity. The residual excited
state population shows an oscillatory dependence on the laser intensity, while the total
ionization increases monotonically with the intensity.

In summary, we have shown that the methods used by Adler et al. can be extended
to the case of chirped pulses and to the inclusion of ATI. The population dynamics
and ionization spectra of cesium atoms subjected to strong short laser pulses has been

17

analyzed. We have found that the behavior of that system is quite sensitive to the
laser light characteristics, such as pulse lengths, frequency chirp and intensity spatial
proﬁle, that are not usually taken into account.

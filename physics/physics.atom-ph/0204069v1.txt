Electron-hydrogen scattering is studied in the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equation approach. The
equations are solved by using the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion technique. We present S-
and P -wave scattering and reactions cross sections up to the H(n = 4) threshold.

Introduction

The scattering of electrons on hydrogen atom is a fun-
damental three-body problem in atomic physics. The
long-range Coulomb interaction presents the major diﬃ-
culty. On the other hand, it is a special kind of Coulomb
three-body problem as it contains two identical parti-
cles. While many studies have been carried out aiming
at solving the Schr¨odinger equation using perturbative,
close-coupling, variational or direct numerical methods
approaches along to the Faddeev equations are relatively
scarce. Here, by solving Faddeev-type integral equations,
we present a general numerical method suitable for the
treatment of elastic and inelastic processes in three-body
Coulombic systems with two identical particles and apply
the formalism for the electron-hydrogen system.

For quantum mechanical three-body systems the Fad-
deev integral equations are the fundamental equations.
They possess connected kernels and therefore they are
Fredholm-type integral equations of second kind. The
Faddeev equations were derived for short range inter-
actions and if we simply plug-in a Coulomb-like poten-
tial they become singular. The necessary modiﬁcation
were proposed by Merkuriev [1]. In Merkuriev’s approach
the Coulomb interactions were split into short-range and
long-range parts. The long-range parts were included
into the ,,free” Green’s operators and the Faddeev pro-
cedure were performed only with the short-range poten-
tials. The corresponding modiﬁed Faddeev, or Faddeev-
Merkuriev equations are mathematically well-behaved.
They possess compact kernels even in the case of at-
tractive Coulombic interactions. This means that the
Faddeev-Merkuriev equations possess all the nice prop-
erties of the original Faddeev equations.

However, the associated three-body Coulomb Green’s
operator is not known explicitly. To circumvent the prob-
lem the integral equations were cast into diﬀerential form
and the appropriate boundary conditions were derived
from the asymptotic analysis of the three-body Coulomb
Green’s operator. These modiﬁed Faddeev diﬀerential
equations were successfully solved for various atomic
three-body problems, including electron-hydrogen scat-
tering up to the H(n = 3) threshold [2].

A characteristic property of the atomic three body
systems is that, due to attractive Coulomb interactions,

they have inﬁnitely many two-body channels. If the to-
tal energy of the system increases more and more chan-
nels open up. The diﬀerential equation approach needs
boundary conditions for each channels, and becomes in-
tractable if the energy increases beyond a limit. Integral
equations do not need boundary conditions, this informa-
tion is incorporated in the Green’s operators. They need
initial conditions, which are much simpler. Therefore an
integral equation approach to the three-body Coulomb
problem would be very useful, it could provide an uniﬁed
description of the scattering and reactions processes for
all energies.

In the past few years we have developed a new ap-
proach to the three-body Coulomb problem. Faddeev-
type integral equations were solved by using the
Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion method. The
approach was developed ﬁrst for solving the nuclear
three-body scattering problem with repulsive Coulomb
interactions [3], which has been adapted recently for
atomic systems with attractive Coulomb interactions
[4]. The basic concept in this method is a ,,three-
potential” picture, where the S matrix is given in
three terms.
In this approach we solve the Faddeev-
Merkuriev integral equations such that the associated
three-body Coulomb Green’s operator is calculated by
an independent Lippmann-Schwinger-type integral equa-
tion. This Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation con-
tains the channel-distorted Coulomb Green’s operator,
which can be calculated as a contour integral of two-body
Coulomb Green’s operators. The method were tested
in positron-hydrogen scattering for energies up to the
H(n = 2) − P s(n = 2) gap [4], and good agreements
with the conﬁguration-space solution of the Faddeev-
Merkuriev equations were found.

In this paper we apply this formalism for the electron-
hydrogen scattering problem. In Sec. I we brieﬂy describe
the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations, the details are
given in Ref. [4]. However, the fact that in the electron-
hydrogen system we have to deal with identical particles
requires some additional considerations: the symmetry
simpliﬁes the numerical procedure. In Sec. II the inte-
gral equations are solved by the Coulomb-Sturmian sep-
arable expansion method. In Sec. III we show some test
calculations up to the H(n = 4) threshold with total an-
gular momenta L = 0 and L = 1. Finally, we draw some
conclusions.

I. FADDEEV-MERKURIEV INTEGRAL
EQUATIONS FOR THE e−
+ H SYSTEM

is used.

In the e− + H system the two electrons are identical.
Let us denote them by 1 and 2, and the non-identical
proton by 3. The Hamiltonian is given by

H = H 0 + vC

1 + vC

2 + vC
3 ,

(1)

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and
vC
α denotes the Coulomb interaction in the subsystem α.
We use the usual conﬁguration-space Jacobi coordinates
xα and yα, where xα is the coordinate between the pair
(β, γ) and yα is the coordinate between the particle α and
the center of mass of the pair (β, γ). Thus the potential
α , the interaction of the pair (β, γ), appears as vC
vC
α (xα).
The Hamiltonian (1) is deﬁned in the three-body Hilbert
space. So, the two-body potential operators are formally
embedded in the three-body Hilbert space,

vC = vC (x)1y,

(2)

where 1y is a unit operator in the two-body Hilbert space
associated with the y coordinate.

The role of a Coulomb potential in a three-body sys-
tem is twofold. In one hand, it acts like a long-range po-
tential since it modiﬁes the asymptotic motion. On the
other hand, however, it acts like a short-range potential,
since it correlates strongly the particles and may support
bound states. Merkuriev introduced a separation of the
three-body conﬁguration space into diﬀerent asymptotic
regions [1]. The two-body asymptotic region Ω is deﬁned
as a part of the three-body conﬁguration space where the
conditions

|x| < x0(1 + |y|/y0)1/ν ,

(3)

with x0, y0 > 0 and ν > 2, are satisﬁed. Merkuriev
proposed to split the Coulomb interaction in the three-
body conﬁguration space into short-range and long-range
terms

vC = v(s) + v(l),

(4)

where the superscripts s and l indicate the short- and
long-range attributes, respectively. The splitting is car-
ried out with the help of a splitting function ζ,

v(s)(x, y) = vC (x)ζ(x, y),
v(l)(x, y) = vC (x) [1 − ζ(x, y)] .

(5a)

(5b)

The function ζ vanishes asymptotically within the three-
body sector, where x ∼ y → ∞, and approaches one in
the two-body asymptotic region Ω, where x << y → ∞.
Consequently in the three-body sector v(s) vanishes and
v(l) approaches vC .
In practice usually the functional
form

ζ(x, y) = 2/ {1 + exp [(x/x0)ν /(1 + y/y0)]} ,

(6)

2

(7)

(8)

In the Hamiltonian (1) the Coulomb potential vC
3 , the
interaction between the two electrons, is repulsive, and
does not support bound states. Consequently, there are
no two-body channels associated with this fragmentation.
Therefore the entire vC
3 can be considered as long-range
potential. Then, the long-range Hamiltonian is deﬁned
as

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

1 + v(l)

2 + vC
3 ,

and the three-body Hamiltonian takes the form

H = H (l) + v(s)

1 + v(s)
2 .

So, the Hamiltonian (8) appears formally as a three-
body Hamiltonian with two short-range potentials. The
bound-state wave function |Ψi satisﬁes the homogeneous
Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation

|Ψi = G(l)

1 + v(s)
v(s)

2

|Ψi = G(l)v(s)

1 |Ψi + G(l)v(s)

h

i

2 |Ψi,
(9)

where G(l)(z) = (z − H (l))−1 is the resolvent operator
of H (l). This induce, in the spirit of the Faddeev pro-
cedure, the splitting of the wave function |Ψi into two
components

where the components are deﬁned by

|Ψi = |ψ1i + |ψ2i,

|ψαi = G(l)v(s)

α |Ψi,

(10)

(11)

with α = 1, 2. The components satisfy the set of two-
component Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations

|ψ1i = |Φ(l)
|ψ2i =

1 i+ G(l)
G(l)

where G(l)

is the resolvent operator of the channel

H (l)

α = H (l) + v(s)

(13)

and the inhomogeneous term |Φ(l)

Before going further let us examine the spectral prop-

erties of the Hamiltonian

H (l)

1 = H (l) + v(s)

1 = H 0 + vC

1 + v(l)

3 .

(14)

It obviously supports inﬁnitely many two-body chan-
nels associated with the bound states of the attrac-
tive Coulomb potential vC
3 is repul-
sive and does not have bound states. The three-body
potential v(l)
is attractive and constructed such that
2
v(l)
2 (x2, y2) → 0 if y2 → ∞. Therefore, there are no two-
body channels associated with fragmentations 2 and 3,

1 . The potential vC

3

the Hamiltonian H (l)
1 has only 1-type two-body asymp-
totic channels. Consequently, the corresponding G(l)
1
Green’s operator, acting on the v(s)
1 |ψ2i term in (12a),
will generate only 1-type two-body asymptotic channels
in |ψ1i. Similar analysis is valid also for |ψ2i. Thus, the
Faddeev-Merkuriev procedure results in the separation
of the three-body wave function into components such a
way that each component has only one type of two-body
asymptotic channels. This is the main advantage of the
Faddeev equations and, as this analysis shows, this prop-
erty remains true also for attractive Coulomb potentials
if the Merkuriev splitting is adopted.

In the e−e−p system the particles 1 and 2, the two
electrons, are identical and indistinguishable. Therefore,
the Faddeev components |ψ1i and |ψ2i, in their own nat-
ural Jacobi coordinates, should have the same functional
forms

hx1y1|ψ1i = hx2y2|ψ2i = hxy|ψi.

(15)

On the other hand, by interchanging the two electrons
we have

P|ψ1i = p|ψ2i,

(16)

Since the three-body Hilbert space is a direct product
of two-body Hilbert spaces an appropriate basis is the
bipolar basis, which can be deﬁned as the angular mo-
mentum coupled direct product of the two-body bases,

|nνlλiα = |nliα ⊗ |νλiα,

(n, ν = 0, 1, 2, . . . ),

(19)

where |nliα and |νλiα are associated with the coordinates
xα and yα, respectively. With this basis the complete-
ness relation takes the form (with angular momentum
summation implicitly included)

so far no approximation has been made, and although
this Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equation has only one
component, yet it gives a full account on the asymptotic
and symmetry properties of the system.

II. COULOMB-STURMIAN SEPARABLE
EXPANSION APPROACH

We solve this integral equation by applying the
Coulomb–Sturmian separable expansion approach. This
approach has been established in a series of papers for
two- [5] and three-body [3, 4, 6] problems with Coulomb-
like potentials. The Coulomb-Sturmian (CS) functions
are deﬁned by

hr|nli =

1/2

n!
(n + 2l + 1)! (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(2br)l+1 exp(−br)L2l+1

(2br),

n

with n and l being the radial and orbital angular mo-
mentum quantum numbers, respectively, and b is the
size parameter of the basis. The CS functions {|nli}
form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two-
body Hilbert space; the biorthogonal partner deﬁned by

The most crucial point in this procedure is the calcu-
G1. The Green’s operator

G1 is a resolvent of the sum of two commuting Hamilto-
nians. Thus, according to the convolution theorem, the

G1 equates to a convolution

since in this work we are considering scattering below the

By doing so, the singularities of gx1 and gy1 become well
In fact, gy1 is a free Green’s operator with

a Coulomb Green’s operator, which, as function of z′, has
a branch-cut on the (−∞, E + iε] interval and inﬁnitely
many poles accumulated at E + iε. Now, the branch cut
of gy1 can easily be encircled such that the singularities
of gx1 lie outside the encircled domain (Fig. 1). However,
this would not be the case in the ε → 0 limit. Therefore
the contour C is deformed analytically such that the up-
per part descends into the unphysical Riemann sheet of
gy1, while the lower part of C is detoured away from the
cut (Fig. 2). The contour in Fig. 2 is achieved by deform-
ing analytically the one in Fig. 1, but now, even in the
ε → 0 limit, the contour in Fig. 2 avoids the singularities
of gx1. Thus, with the contour in Fig. 2 the mathemat-
ical conditions for the contour integral representation of
G1 in Eq. (38) is met also for scattering-state energies.

In the three-potential formalism [3, 4] the S matrix
can be decomposed into three terms. The ﬁrst one de-
scribes a single channel Coulomb scattering, the second
one is a multichannel two-body-type scattering due to
the potential U , and the third one is a genuine three-
body scattering. In our e− + H case the target is neutral

and the ﬁrst term is absent. For the on-shell T matrix

III. RESULTS

In the numerical calculations we use atomic units (the
mass of the electrons m1 = m2 = 1 and the mass of
the proton m3 = 1836.151527).
In this paper we are
concerned with total angular momenta L = 0 and L = 1.
The formula (40) gives some hint for the choice of the
parameters in the splitting function ζ. We can expect
good convergence if the ”size” of v(s)
corresponds to the
1
”size” of Φ(l)(−)
. Therefore we may need to adjust the
parameters of the splitting function if we consider more
and more open channels. Consequently, we also need to
adjust the b parameter of the CS basis. We found that
the ﬁnal results and the rate of the convergence does not
depend on the choice of b, within a rather broad interval
around the optimal value.

1f

Having the T matrix we can also calculate the K ma-
trix, whose symmetry, which is equivalent to the unitarity
of the S matrix, provides a delicate and independent test
of the method. We observed that if either the parameters
of the splitting function are too far from the optimum or
the convergence with the basis is not achieved the K ma-
trix fails to be symmetric. In the separable expansion we
take up to 9 bipolar angular momentum channels with
CS functions up to N = 36. This requires solution of
complex general matrix equations with maximal size of
12321 × 12321, a problem which can even be handled on
a workstation. We need relatively small basis because in
this approach we approximate only short-range type po-
tentials and the correct asymptotic is guaranteed by the
Green’s operators.

We present ﬁrst our S-wave results for energies below
In this energy region we use
the H(n = 2) threshold.
parameters ν = 2.1, x0 = 3, y0 = 20 and b = 0.6. Table
I shows elastic phase shifts at several values of electron

momenta k1. Our results, which was achieved by using
ﬁnite proton mass, agree very well with variational cal-
culations of Ref. [8], R-matrix calculations of Ref. [9],
ﬁnite-element method of Ref. [10], as well as with the
results of direct numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation of Ref. [11], where inﬁnite mass for proton were
adopted. We also compare our calculation with the dif-
ferential equation solution of the modiﬁed Faddeev equa-
tions [2]. We can observe perfect agreements with all the
previous calculations.

In Table II we present S-wave partial cross sections and
K matrices between the H(n = 2) − H(n = 3) thresholds
at channel energy E1 = 0.81Ry and for L = 0, where we
have 3 open channels. We used parameters ν = 2.1, x0 =
3.5, y0 = 20 and b = 0.3. For comparison we also show
the results of a conﬁguration-space Faddeev calculation
[12]. We can report perfect agreements not only for the
cross sections but also for the K matrix (except for an
unphysical phase factor). Our cross sections are also in
a good agreements with the results of Ref. [11].

In Tables III we show the S-wave K matrix between
the H(n = 3) − H(n = 4) thresholds at channel energy
E1 = 0.93Ry, where we have 6 open channels. We used
parameters ν = 2.1, x0 = 4, y0 = 20 and b = 0.2. We
can see that the K matrix is nearly perfectly symmetric.
In Tables IV we present S-wave partial cross sections be-
tween the H(n = 3) − H(n = 4) thresholds at channel
energies E1 = 0.93Ry, E1 = 0.91Ry and E1 = 0.89Ry,
respectively. In Tables V-VIII we present the correspond-
ing P -wave K matrices and cross sections.

IV. SUMMARY

In this work we have studied electron-hydrogen scat-
tering problem by solving the Faddeev-Merkuriev inte-
gral equations. In this particular case, where two parti-
cles are identical, the Faddeev scheme results in an one-
component equation, which, however, gives full account
on the asymptotic and symmetry properties of the sys-
tem. We solved the integral equations by applying the
Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion method.

We calculated S- and P -wave scattering and reaction
cross sections for energies up to the H(n = 4) thresh-
old. Our nearly perfectly symmetric K matrices indicate
that in our approach all the ﬁne details of the scattering
processes are properly taken into account.

that a part of it goes on the unphysical Riemann-sheet of
gy1 (drawn by broken line) and the other part detoured away
from the cut. Now, the contour avoids the singularities of
gx1 (E + iε − z′

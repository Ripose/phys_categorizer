Circularly polarized laser ﬁeld causes a shift in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra
of all substances. The shift is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam and yields oppositely
signed values for left- and right-circularly polarized light, CPL -/+, respectively. Rapid switching —
in the NMR time scale — between CPL+ and CPL- gives rise to a splitting of the NMR resonance
lines. We present uncorrelated and correlated quadratic response calculations of the splitting per
unit of beam intensity in the NMR spectra of 21Ne, 83Kr, and 129Xe. We study both the regions far
away from and near to optical resonance and predict oﬀ-resonance shifts of the order 0.01, 0.1, and
1×10−6 Hz for 21Ne, 83Kr, and 129Xe, respectively, for a beam intensity of 10 W/cm2. Enhancement
by several orders of magnitude is predicted as the beam frequency approaches resonance. Only then
can the eﬀect on guest 129Xe atoms be potentially useful as a probe of the properties of the host
material.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has
become one of the most successful techniques for the anal-
ysis of molecular structure [1]. Irradiation by circularly
polarized light (CPL) from a laser has been proposed as
a potentially useful technique of enhancing the resolution
of NMR spectra [2]. Early experiments searching for the
eﬀect, in a solution of chiral molecules, reported shifts of
the order of 1 Hz in a 270 MHz NMR spectrum [3]. Much
of that magnitude can, however, be explained by heat-
ing eﬀects and only a residual of at most 0.1 Hz could
be interpreted as originating in other mechanisms [4].
Theory for the laser ﬁeld-induced NMR shifts was pre-
sented by Buckingham and Parlett [5, 6], in terms of
the inverse Faraday eﬀect [7], i.e., induced magnetiza-
tion caused by the CPL beam propagating through any
sample. Since the laser-induced shifts become propor-
tional to the square of the electric ﬁeld of the laser or,
equivalently, the intensity of the beam [5, 6, 8], initial
proposals involved using high-intensity pulsed lasers to
obtain shifts of the order of GHz [2]. This is, however,
ruled out in NMR experiments, even leaving aside the
heating problem, due to the long lifetime of the nuclear
spin states. Hence, intensities of the order of tens of
W/cm2, obtainable from continuous wave lasers, must
be considered in estimates of the order of magnitude of
the induced shifts. Left- and right-circularly polarized
light cause opposite shifts. If the laser ﬁeld is switched
between the two modes rapidly in the NMR time scale,
the spectral lines are doubled, with splitting proportional

to the beam intensity.

NMR of guest rare gas atoms can be used as a sen-
sitive probe of the microstructure of the surrounding
medium [9]. In this work, we present ab initio electronic
structure calculations of the laser-induced splitting per
unit of beam intensity in the NMR spectra of free atomic
21Ne, 83Kr, and 129Xe, both at frequencies away from and
near to optical resonance. In the oﬀ-resonance region, at
standard laser wave lengths and intensities, the splittings
in 129Xe are below the limit of current experimental ca-
pabilities, while a large enhancement is expected when
approaching resonance.

and oriented along the direction of propagation of the

cleus K, to give a term in the NMR spin Hamiltonian (in
frequency units) in the high-ﬁeld approximation as

where γK is the magnetogyric ratio of K, IK,Z is the

oppositely directed frequency shifts, ∆ and −∆, for the
two diﬀerently polarized beams. ∆ depends on the in-
tensity I0 of the beam, and becomes [12]

∆ =

where c and ǫ0 are the speed of light and permittivity of

Calculations of ∆/I0 were performed with the Dal-
ton program [13], using the implementations of analytic
quadratic response functions of Ref. 14 at the ab initio
self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) and multiconﬁguration SCF
(MCSCF) levels, and Ref. 15 using density-functional
theory (DFT). We studied the basis set convergence of
the laser-induced shifts, starting with the uncontracted
Gaussian basis set denoted by HIVu in Ref. [16]. Dif-
fuse (small-exponent) functions were added to each block
of angular momentum until convergence of the results
at the correlated MCSCF level [using the complete ac-
tive space (CAS) [17] wave function speciﬁed in Table I]
to within 0.1% was reached. This procedure has been
shown to lead to results close to the basis set limit in
the calculation of nuclear magnetic shielding constants
of the rare gases [18]. The ﬁnal, converged basis sets are
(15s 11p 7d 5f ), (19s 16p 15d 5f ), and (26s 20p 16d 3f ) for
Ne, Kr and Xe, respectively. All the results reported
below correspond to these converged basis.

Both CAS and restricted active space (RAS) [19] -type
MCSCF wave functions were used. The details of the
chosen active spaces are given in Table I. The three-
parameter hybrid B3LYP functional [20] was used in the
DFT calculations. The calculations were performed for
a set of typical laser frequencies. We also calculated the
lowest singlet excitation energies for each atom with a

2

CASSCF wave function, to estimate the range of fre-
quencies where optical resonances occur. These ranges
are 0.63–1.05 a.u. for Ne, 0.41–0.52 a.u. for Kr, and 0.35–
0.45 a.u. for Xe. ∆/I0 was evaluated at frequencies ap-
proaching the resonance, too.

The results for ∆/I0 in 21Ne, 83Kr and 129Xe are pre-
sented in Table II. The range of the shifts, calculated at
SCF level, due to a laser beam intensity of 10 W/cm2 and
wavelengths between 13190 and 4880 ˚A, is 1.7–4.7 nHz
for 21Ne, 9.6–30 nHz for 83Kr, and 80–290 nHz for 129Xe.
The corresponding values for 131Xe are of the opposite
sign and smaller than those for 129Xe, and can be ob-
tained from the latter by multiplying by the quotient
of the respective magnetogyric ratios γ131Xe/γ129Xe =
−0.296.

Inclusion of electron correlation at the CAS level in-
creases ∆/I0 by about about 15% for Ne, but decreases
it by ca. 20% for Kr and Xe. Comparison of the results
obtained with the diﬀerent RAS and CAS wave functions
shows that the choice of the active space is more impor-
tant than using the multireference (CAS) wave functions.
With RAS wave functions, correlation increases the shifts
by up to around 15% for Ne and 25% for Kr and Xe, com-
pared to the SCF level. For all atoms and frequencies, the
DFT/B3LYP results are signiﬁcantly larger than those
corresponding to the ab initio methods. We have also
tested the LDA and BLYP functionals, which resulted in
even larger shifts.

The larger shifts obtained for Xe as compared to Ne
and Kr can be attributed to the larger polarizability of
xenon. The electron cloud is deformed in response to
the external electric ﬁeld, thus giving a corresponding
larger induced magnetic ﬁeld at the nuclear site. Results
of correlated CAS calculations of ∆/I0 and the dynamic
polarizability α(ω), for Ne, Kr, and Xe as a function
of the laser frequency ω, are depicted in Fig. 1. The
frequency ranges from 0.1 a.u. to near the threshold of
optical resonance, where the properties diverge because
of the poles in linear and quadratic response functions.
The growth of ∆/I0 with ω, although qualitatively simi-
lar to α(ω), is faster than in the latter property. There is
an enhancement of ∆/I0 by several orders of magnitude
when optical resonance is approached.

Finally, we have also carried out a preliminary inves-
tigation of the inﬂuence of relativistic eﬀects on ∆, by
including the mass-velocity H mv = − 1

were evaluated using cubic response functions [21] at
the CAS level. The corresponding corrections to the
shifts, ∆mv and ∆Dar, have opposite signs and partially
cancel each other. As expected, the relativistic eﬀects

3

in 21Ne are completely negligible. For 83Kr, bmv
K and
bDar
K represent, individually, corrections of the same or-
der of magnitude as the uncorrected value of bK, although
their partial cancellation ﬁnally leads to values approxi-
mately 25% larger than the nonrelativistic value. Finally,
bmv
Xe and bDar
Xe are larger than the nonrelativistic values,
roughly by a factor of three. Their cancellation leads to
a corrected value of about −50 nHz for all the frequen-
cies studied, with I0 = 10 W/cm2. No deﬁnitive con-
clusions may be drawn based on these results, however,
as the response functions retain their nonrelativistic pole
structure in this approach. Furthermore, picture change
eﬀects [22] on the hyperﬁne operator are also presently
neglected. A fully relativistic quadratic response calcu-
lation would be more appropriate, and will be pursued
in the future.

In summary, we have calculated the shifts induced by
circularly polarized laser beam, to the NMR spectra for
atomic 21Ne, 83Kr, and 129Xe using ﬁrst principles elec-
tronic structure methods. At typical beam intensities

and laser frequencies, the shifts are much too small for ob-
servation, with the shift for 129Xe predicted at the order
of magnitude of 1 µHz. Experimental techniques exploit-
ing higher beam frequencies would beneﬁt from the dra-
matic enhancement expected at near-resonant frequen-
cies.
If realised experimentally, the eﬀect may provide
a new characteristic signature of molecular structure in
NMR spectroscopy.

Abstract. Magnetically tunable scattering resonances have been used with great success for precise
control of s-wave scattering lengths in ultracold atomic collisions. We describe relatively simple yet
quite powerful analytic treatments of such resonances based on the analytic properties of the van der
Waals long range potential. This theory can be used to characterize a number of properties of speciﬁc
resonances that have been used successfully in various experiments with 87Rb, 85Rb, 40K, and 6Li.
Optical Feshbach resonances are also possible and may be practical with narrow intercombination
line photoassociative transitions in species like Sr and Yb.

This will be published in Atomic Physics 20, the Proceedings of the 20th international

Conference on Atomic Physics, Innsbruck, Austria, July 2006.

INTRODUCTION

Tunable control of scattering resonances between interacting ultracold atoms has been
widely used in many forefront experiments in atomic physics, many of which are
described at this Conference. Such experiments may use bosonic or fermionic species
and explore phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), quantum degenerate
Fermi gases, cold molecule formation, molecular BEC, few-body physics, or reduced
dimensional structures in optical lattices. The control of such systems comes from the
ability to tune the near-threshold scattering and bound state properties of interacting
cold atoms. Threshold collisions are characterized by the scattering length a, which
represents a quantum phase expressed in units of length: the scattering phase shift
h (E) → −ka as E → 0 at low collision energy E, where ¯hk is the relative collision
momentum. The ability to make a vary over a wide range between ±¥ using a tunable
scattering resonance is what allows for precise control of cold atomic gases. This talk
will not survey the kinds of experiments that are being done, since these will be covered
by many other speakers, but will instead concentrate on developing some simple models
that provide understanding of these resonances, using as examples resonances that have
been or are being exploited in key ultracold atom experiments.

In general, scattering resonances are complex and require either detailed experimen-
tal studies in order to measure their properties or detailed knowledge of the molecular
physics of the interacting system in order to calculate their properties. On the other hand,
they remain amenable to simple models. The simplest is a universal model parameter-
ized solely in terms of the scattering length a and reduced mass m of the pair of atoms.
This will apply to scattering and bound states sufﬁciently close to threshold. However,

the subject of this talk is a much more powerful model, extending over a much wider
range of energy, based on the analytic properties of the van der Waals potential. We
will primarily consider resonances tunable by a magnetic ﬁeld B, but brieﬂy consider
resonances tunable by an optical ﬁeld of frequency n .

RESONANT SCATTERING

There is a long history of resonance scattering, going back to the earliest days of
quantum physics [1, 2], and widely developed in nuclear physics, especially the elegant
formalism of Herman Feshbach [3], whose name has become attached to the resonances
used in ultracold atom research. Tiesinga et al. [4] pointed out the existence of sharp
resonances versus B in the scattering length of ultracold Cs atoms, and the quest for
resonance control of ultracold collisions was underway. A recent review [5] describes
the near threshold properties of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in the context
of cold molecule formation and atom paring.

Whatever theory one uses, the colliding two-atom system is separated into an ap-
proximate bound state |ni with discrete energy En and a scattering continuum |Ei with
a continuous spectrum of collision energies E with some coupling V between |ni and
|Ei. The "bare" bound state |ni in the absence of coupling is the closed channel, or
resonance, state, and the "bare" continuum |Ei in the absence of coupling represents
the open channel, or "background" scattering. Following Fano’s classic 1961 paper [6],
the scattering phase shift h (E) separates into background and resonance components:
h (E) = h bg + h res(E), where the weak energy dependence of h bg over a narrow reso-
nance can be ignored. The resonance contribution varies rapidly by p as E varies from
below to above resonance at shifted energy E0 = En + d En:

h res(E) = − tan−1

G n
1
2
E − En − d En

,

where G n = 2p |hn|V |Eni|2 and d En are the resonance width and shift respectively.

This theory is modiﬁed for near-threshold resonances in that h bg(E), G n(E), and
d En(E) become strongly E-dependent, following quantum threshold law behavior. For
a magnetically tunable resonance En = dm
(B − Bn) crosses threshold (E = 0) at B = Bn,
and dm
gives the magnetic moment difference between the "bare" open channel atoms
and the "bare" resonance state. The phase near threshold is:

and sufﬁciently large, there is a bound state with binding energy Eb related to a(B) by
the "universal" relation Eb = ¯h2/(2m a(B)2). This universal relation applies for a number
of known experimental resonances [5].

ANALYTIC VAN DER WAALS THEORY

While universal resonance properties parameterized by a(B) are certainly useful, a much
more powerful theory is possible by introducing the analytic properties of the van der
Waals potential, which varies at large interatomic separation R as −C6/R6. The solutions
for a single potential, depending solely on C6, reduced mass m and scattering length a for
that potential, have been worked out in a series of articles by B. Gao [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
The van der Waals theory is especially powerful for threshold resonances and bound
states when the van der Waals solutions are used as the reference solutions for the
speciﬁc form of the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) developed by Mies
and coworkers [14, 15, 16, 17]. In particular, the MQDT is concerned with the analytic
properties of single and coupled channels wave functions Y
(R, E) across thresholds
as E goes from positive to negative and between short and long range in R. The van
der Waals and MQDT theories, when combined, give simple formulas for threshold
resonance properties that have illuminating physical interpretations. For all cases where
we have tested it numerically, the van der Waals MQDT gives scattering properties in
excellent agreement with full coupled channels scattering calculations over a wide range
of energies exceeding those normally encountered in cold atom experiments below 1
mK. It is especially good in the ultracold domain of a few m K and below.

The key parameters are the scale length Rvdw = (1/2)

and correspond-
ing energy Evdw = ¯h2/(2m R2
vdw) associated with the long range potential [18]. Table 1
(cid:0)
lists these for typical alkali species. When |E| ≪ Evdw, bound and scattering wave func-
tions approach their long range asymptotic form for R ≫ Rvdw and oscillate rapidly on a
length scale small compared to Rvdw for R ≪ Rvdw. When E is much larger than Evdw, it
is always a good approximation to make a semiclassical WKB connection between the
short range and long range parts of the wave function, but when E is small compared to
Evdw, a quantum connection is necessary, even for s-waves. In such a case, Rvdw char-
acterizes the distance range where the WKB connection fails [16]. An alternative van
der Waals length, ¯a = 0.956Rvdw, called the "mean scattering length" and which appears
naturally in van der Waals theory, has been deﬁned by Gribakin and Flambaum [19].
They also gave the the correction to universality in bound state binding energy due to
the long range potential: Eb = ¯h2/(2m (a − ¯a)2).

The key result from the MQDT analysis, derivable from formulas in the original
papers [14, 15], is that the energy-dependent threshold width and shift can be written
in the following factored form:

where ¯G n is independent of E and B and depends on the short range physics that
determines the strength of the resonance. The two functions Cbg(E)−2 and tan l bg(E), as

well as h bg(E), are analytic functions of the entrance channel, or background, potential,
and are completely given from the analytic van der Waals theory once C6, reduced mass,
and abg are speciﬁed. When E ≫ Evdw such that the semiclassical WKB approximation
applies at all R, the two MQDT functions take on the following limiting behavior [14,
15, 16]:

where r = abg/ ¯a represents the background scattering length in units of ¯a. With these

The dependence on B occurs only in the linear term in the denominator. The dependence
on the entrance channel is contained solely in the h bg(E), Cbg(E)−2, and tan l bg(E)
functions. The strength of the resonant coupling is given by the single parameter ¯G n.
Numerical calculations show that phase shifts predicted by this formula are in superb
agreement with full coupled channels calculations over wide ranges of B and E for
typical resonances.

One pleasing aspect of MQDT theory is that C(E)−1 has a simple physical interpre-
tation [14, 15], described in the context of cold atom collisions by [16]. The asymptotic
entrance channel wave function for R ≫ ¯a is f (R, E) = sin(kR + h bg(E))/k1/2. At short
range, R ≪ ¯a, it is convenient to write the wave function with a different normaliza-
tion, that of the WKB semiclassical approximation, ˆf (R, E) = sin b(R, E)/k(R, E)1/2,
2m (E −V (R))/¯h2 is the local wavenumber. Since the potential is quite

R

large in magnitude at short range in comparison with E ≈ 0, the ˆf WKB function
is essentially independent of energy and has a shape determined by the WKB phase
k(R′)dR′ + p /4, so that we can replace ˆf (R, E) by ˆf (R, 0) when R ≪ ¯a. The
b(R) =
WKB-assisted MQDT theory shows that the relation between f (R, E) and ˆf (R, E) (at
all R) is f (R, E) = C(E)−1 ˆf (R, E) [14, 15]. Thus, when R ≪ ¯a, the background channel
wave function can be replaced by C(E)−1 ˆf (R, 0), so that, in particular, the coupling ma-
trix element that determines the E-dependent width of the resonance can be written in
factored form: Vn(E) = hn|V |Ei = C(E)−1 ˆVn, where ˆVn depends only on the short range
physics and is independent of E and B near threshold. Thus, the short range physics,
which depends on the large energy scale set by the deep short range potential, is sepa-
rated from the long range physics and its very small energy scale near threshold. Con-
sequently, given abg, the threshold properties depend only on the long range part of the
potential.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the threshold properties of a 40K resonance that has been
used for experiments involving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation [20], fermionic
pairing [21], and reduced dimension [22]. Figure 3 shows similar results for a 85Rb res-
onance that has been used to make a stable condensate [24] and exhibit atom-molecule
interconversion [25]. The abg is positive (negative) for 40K (85Rb). In both cases |abg| > ¯a
and there is peak in C(E)−2 near E = ¯h2/(2m (abg − ¯a)2). Recall that C(E)−2 represents
the squared amplitude enhancement of the short range wave function relative to the
WKB wave function. The peak value of C(E)−2 is about 3.4 for the 85Rb case. Note
also that the shift d En(E) (cid:181)

tan l (E) vanishes as E increases above Evdw.

The analytic van der Waals theory also gives the effective range of the potential [11,
27], and can be put into an angular-momentum independent form that predicts the bound
states for different partial waves, given abg, C6, and reduced mass [11, 12, 13]. For
example, if |abg| becomes very large compared to ¯a, there will be a g-wave bound or
quasibound state near threshold. This is the case for 133Cs and 85Rb, for example. On

FIGURE 2. Scattering (sin2 h (E, B) for E > 0) and bound states (lines for E < 0) near the B/BG =202
40K a + b resonance, where BG = 10−4T = 1 Gauss, with the resonant coupling V turned off (bare) or on
(dressed). Light-colored shading for E > 0 implies scattering near the unitarity limit of the S-matrix. The
energy zero is chosen to be the energy of two motionless separated atoms at each B. The energy scale of
E/h = ±40 MHz corresponds to a range of E/kB = ±2 mK, where kB is Boltzmann’s constant. The shift
from Bn to B0, where the dressed (solid line) bound state crosses threshold, is evident due to the avoided
crossing between the last bound state of the background channel at E−1 and the bare resonant state with
En = dm
(B − Bn) and dm /h = 23.5 GHz/T. The interference of the ramping bare resonance state with the
background is evident for E > 0. A "sharp" resonance (G n(E) ≪ E) only emerges for E ≫ Evdw [23].

the other hand, if abg is close to ¯a there will be a d-wave bound or quasibound state very
close to threshold. This is the case for 23Na, 87Rb, and 174Yb, all of which have a slightly
larger than ¯a and all have quaisbound d-wave shape resonances close to threshold.

The van der Waals theory also permits a criterion for classifying resonances according
to their open or closed channel character [5]. Let us deﬁne a dimensionless resonance
D n/Evdw). Let Z be the norm of the closed channel
strength parameter S = (abg/ ¯a)(dm
component of the wave function of the near threshold dressed bound state (1 − Z is the
norm of the open channel component). Open channel dominated resonances have S ≫ 1
and closed channel dominated ones have S ≪ 1. The bound states of the former are
universal and have Z ≪ 1 for a range of |B − B0| that is a signiﬁcant fraction of D n;
scattering states have G n(E) > E for E < Evdw, so that no resonance "feature" appears
for E < Evdw. The bound states for closed channel dominated resonances have only a
small domain of universality near B0 over a range that is small compared to D n, and have
Z ≈ 1 except over this narrow range; scattering states can have G n(E) ≪ E for E < Evdw,
so that sharp resonance features can appear in this range very close to threshold. The
40K and 85Rb resonances described above, as well as the broad 6Li resonance near 834
G [28], are open channel dominated. The very narrow 6Li resonance near 543 G [29]
and the 87Rb resonance near 1007 G [30, 31] are examples of closed channel dominated
ones. A good description of the two 6Li resonances has been given by [35].

One application of the expression in Eq. (8) is to provide an analytic form for the
energy-dependent scattering length a(E, B) = tan−1 h (E, B)/k. This quantity is deﬁned
so as to give the scattering length in the limit E → 0 but can be used at ﬁnite E to

FIGURE 3. The left panel shows the C(E)−2 and tan l (E) functions for the background collision of
two 85Rb atoms in the e = {F = 2, M = −2} state. The van der Waals energy is Evdw/kB = 0.3 mK or
Evdw/h = 6 MHz. The right panel is analogous to Fig. 2, with the same shading of sin2 h (E, B) for E > 0

conﬁned systems with reduced dimension [32, 33, 34].

Finally, it is worth noting that optical Feshbach resonances [36, 37] follow a similar
theory to the magnetic ones. An optical Feshbach is a photoassociation resonance [18]
where a laser with frequency hn and intensity I couples colliding ground state atoms to
an excited bound state at frequency hn 0 relative to E = 0 ground state atoms. Both the
resonance width G n(E) and shift (contained in hn 0) are proportional to I. The general
expression for the resonant scattering length is

where, in the case of an optical resonance, G 0 = (lopt/abg)g , E0 = −h(n − n 0), and
g /¯h is the spontaneous emission decay rate of the excited state. This compares with
G 0 = dm
(B − B0) and g /¯h ≈ 0 for a typical magnetic resonance. The optical
resonance strength is characterized by the optical length lopt [38], proportional to I and
the free-bound Franck-Condon factor |hn|Ei|2. The two-body decay rate coefﬁcient due
to decay of the resonance is k2 = 2(h/m )bres. Optical resonance are only practical when
|ares| ≫ bres, insuring that the decay rate is sufﬁciently small. Assuming the detuning
D = h(n − n 0) to be large in magnitude compared to g , then ares = lopt(g /D ) and
bres = (lopt/2)(g /D )2. Thus, the condition g /|D
| ≪ 1 ensures small decay, while the
condition lopt ≫ |abg − ares| is necessary in order to make a meaningful change in abg.

Satisfying the above conditions is difﬁcult for strongly allowed optical transitions
for which g
is large, since very large detuning from atomic resonance is necessary in
order to suppress losses, and then lopt is too small for reasonable intersity I; alternatively

changing abg is accompanied by large losses. These problems can be eliminated by
working with narrow intercombination line transitions of species such as Ca, Sr, or
Yb [38, 39, 40]. Quite large values of lopt can be achieved for levels very close to the
atomic dissociation limit of the molecular excited state, and it appears to be feasible to
use such resonances to control scattering lengths [39].

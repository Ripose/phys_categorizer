We present three dimensional time-dependent calculations of ionization of arbitrarily spatially oriented H+
2
by attosecond, intense, high-frequency laser ﬁelds. The ionization probability shows a strong dependence on
both the internuclear distance and the relative orientation between the laser ﬁeld and the internuclear axis.

PACS numbers: 33.80.Rv

The ionization dynamics of one- and two-electron pro-
cesses in diatomic molecules in short, strong laser ﬁelds are at
present under intense experimental investigation [1, 2, 3]. A
part of these investigations also focus on the sensitivity of such
processes to molecular orientation with respect to the light po-
larization [4]. This is again related to the ultimate goal of con-
trolling chemical reactions by aligning the reactive molecules
with respect to each other prior to the intermolecular interac-
tion [5].

From a theoretical viewpoint such studies are extremely
complex in the strong-ﬁeld regime and have been of continu-
ous interest for nearly two decades (for reviews, see, e.g., [6]).
In general, only results based on approximate theories such as
the molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation [7, 8] and tunnel-
ing [9] models have been applied to calculate effects related
to molecular orientation with respect to the light polarization
vector. Such approximate theories are, however, often gauge
dependent [8, 10] and limited in their applicability to describe
complex processes. The ”slowness” of past and present com-
puters have, combined with computational challenges related
to Coulombic multi-center problems, restricted exact theoreti-
cal calculations including both electronic and nuclear degrees
of freedom to cases where the internuclear axis is parallel with
the linear polarization direction [11, 12] or models of reduced
dimensionality [13, 14, 15]. These studies have given insight
into the fascinating interplay between electronic and nuclear
degrees of freedom; phenomena which at present are beyond
reach of full dimensional computations.

In this Letter, we present the ﬁrst full time-dependent three
dimensional calculations for the electronic degrees of freedom
in H+
2 exposed to a short, strong, attosecond laser pulse. The
purpose is to follow the behavior of the system with internu-
clear distance and in particular to display the dependence of
the dynamics on the angle between the internuclear axis and
the linear polarization of the ﬁeld. Calculations are performed
for 6 cycle pulses with ω = 2 a.u. (23 nm) central frequency.
This corresponds to pulse durations around 450 as, which
have already been demonstrated [16]. The ionization prob-
ability for H(2p) atoms exposed to similar light sources [17]
showed a factor 10 stronger modulation with changing orien-
tation than what was measured with femtosecond pulses [4].
Similar effects in diatomic molecules may thus indicate that
attosecond pulses may be sensitive probes of the internal nu-
clear quantum state as well as its orientation. The calculations

indeed display that the ionization probability depends strongly
on these parameters. Atomics units (~ = me = e = 1) are
applied throughout.

As the nuclear vibrational period is approximately 103
times larger than the pulse duration, the nuclear degrees of
freedom can be considered frozen during the attosecond pulse.
Post pulse interplay between nuclear and electronic degrees
of freedom, which are important for weaker ﬁelds, are also
found to be unimportant here as direct electronic ionization
dominates.

where up is a unit vector deﬁning the orientation of the lin-

sponding to (1) represents a physical ﬁeld [10]. The validity
of the dipole approximation was investigated in detail very re-
cently for the present intensity and frequency regime, and was
found to be well-justiﬁed for ionization [18]. The vector po-
tential determines the electric ﬁeld, E(t) = −∂tA(t), and the
t

For ﬁxed nuclei, we solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation numerically based on a split-step operator approxi-
mation on a spherical grid. The method was described in de-
tail elsewhere [20, 21]. The wave function is expanded on the

Ionization probability in the parallel geometry (θ = 0◦)

FIG. 2:
the polarization direction and the internuclear axis with ω = 2 a.u.,
E0 = 3 a.u. and T = 6π a.u.

|Ψ0i is obtained by the substitution t → −i t in the propaga-
tor. At internuclear separation R = 2 a.u. this gives an elec-
tronic ground state energy, εgrid
0 = −1.099 a.u., which can be
compared to the exact value of ε0 = −1.103 a.u. Reﬂections
at the edges r = rmax = 60 a.u. are avoided by imposing an
absorbing boundary. We include up to lmax = 15, Nr = 1024
radial points, and in the propagation we use ∆t = 5 × 10−3
a.u. Here we stress that for a given lmax, speciﬁed at input,
the quadrature rule of the spherical harmonics uniquely ﬁxes
the angular points.

At the end of the pulse, t = T , a fraction of the wave func-
tion has been removed by the absorber. Since excitation is
found to be a minor channel, the ionization probability can be
calculated as Pion = 1 − |hΨ0|Ψ(T )i|2.

The ionization probability as a function of internuclear sep-
aration and electric ﬁeld strength is displayed in Fig. 1 for ﬁeld
polarization parallel with the internuclear axis. Two striking
maxima are observed, one for small internuclear separation,
R ∼ 1 a.u., and another for R ∼ 3 a.u. When the ﬁeld
strength is further increased, the ionization probability de-
creases, i.e., the molecule is partly stabilized in the intense
ﬁeld. This rather counterintuitive mechanism has been studied
in detail for atoms [22]. What happens, is that for increasing
intensity, the ﬁnal channels corresponding to single and mul-
tiphoton ionization close while shake-off dynamics with char-
acteristic low-energy electron emission becomes the dominat-
ing ionization mechanism [18]. Between these two regions a
”valley” in the ionization curve with increasing intensity may
occur as indicated around R ∼ 1 a.u. and R ∼ 3 a.u. for ﬁeld
strengths beyond E0 ≈ 7 a.u. At the ground state equilib-
rium distance, R ∼ 2 a.u., and for R ∼ 5 a.u., the ionization
probability is signiﬁcantly smaller, indicating strong dynamic
self-interference effects of the electronic charge clouds asso-
ciated with each scattering center.

From Fig. 1 we see that the variation in the ionization sig-
nal is most pronounced for E0 ∼ 3 a.u. At this ﬁeld strength,
Fig. 2 exposes the ionization probability as a function of in-
ternuclear separation and as a function of the angle θ between

the internuclear axis and the polarization direction of the ﬁeld.
An oscillatory behavior of the ionization probability in the
parallel geometry (θ = 0◦) is seen. As θ increases the os-
cillations gradually decrease, and in the perpendicular geom-
etry (θ = 90◦), the ionization probability drops monotonically
with R. In the ﬁgure, we also observe opposite functional de-
pendence with θ: At R ∼ 2 a.u.
the ionization probability
increases with θ while at R ∼ 3 a.u. it decreases.

We now turn to the detailed dynamics and a qualitative un-
derstanding of the processes underlying the phenomena ob-
served in Fig. 2. Figure 3 shows snapshots of the wave func-
tion in the xz-plane at various times for parallel and perpen-
dicular polarization (the molecule has its internuclear axis di-
rected along z). In general the photoelectron is ionized in the
directions of the ﬁeld. For θ = 0◦ the initial charge cloud is
partly dragged back and forth along the ﬁeld, and this gives
rise to a strong interference between various momentum com-
ponents of the wave function and hence the oscillatory depen-
dence with R in Fig. 1. This effect is absent at θ = 90◦ where
the two atomic-like charge clouds pertaining to each nucleus
oscillates in phase back and forth with the electric ﬁeld. In the
lower right panel, secondary intensity maxima appear at 30◦
and 150◦ with respect to the internuclear axis. These struc-
tures look similar to double slit scattering but have a more
subtle dynamical origin.

The oscillatory behavior in Pion(R) was discussed in a one
dimensional model earlier in terms of the concept of enhanced
ionization [23]. Related phenomena were also discussed in
fast ion-molecule collisions [24]. The following simple ansatz
gives a qualitative explanation of the oscillations and their ab-
sence at θ = 90◦: Assume that the outgoing waves from each
of the scattering centers are a superposition of two outgoing
spherical waves,

ψout = f1(Ω1)

+ f2(Ω2)

eik|r+R/2|
|r + R/2|

eik|r−R/2|
|r − R/2|

If we take the two scattering amplitudes to be equal, f1(Ω1) =
f2(Ω2), the differential ionization probability can be brought

FIG. 4: Angular photoelectron spectrum in the scattering plane for
parallel (dashed curve) and perpendicular (full curve) geometry as
a function of the polar angle for a 6 cycle ﬁeld with E0 = 3 a.u.
and ω = 2 a.u. In both cases, the angle denotes the direction of the
outgoing electron with respect to the internuclear axis. We have used
equal normalizations for the two curves.

The monotonous decrease in Pion with R at θ = 90◦ is
reasonable since the decrease in the ionization potential leads
to an effective higher ﬁnal state electronic momentum with
increasing R.

The angular distribution of the ionization probability can be
calculated from the time integral of the radial current density

where the distance a is chosen large enough to exclude con-
tribution to the current from the quiver motion of an electron
close to the nucleus and small enough to avoid effects induced
by the absorber. The application of this procedure to the out-
going waves of the lower panel of Fig. 3 results in the inten-
sity spectrum of Fig. 4. As already observed from Fig. 3, the
photoelectrons are most likely ejected in the direction of laser
polarization. In the perpendicular arrangement the two peaks
around 30◦ and 150◦ can also be quantiﬁed: The integrated
probability connected to these secondary maxima amounts to
about 25% of the total ionization probability. As these peaks
originate from interference of the outgoing waves, it is inter-
esting to note that in a very recent calculation of High Har-
monic Generation (HHG) in a reduced model with respect to
the electronic degrees of freedom such interference does not
occur [25]. In that work it is pointed out that orientational
effects are very important for HHG.

In conclusion, fully non-perturbational calculations of the
ionization dynamics of H+
2 molecules in intense attosecond
light sources have been carried out. Very strong orientation
effects have been found, demonstrating that in order to obtain
a full understanding of the molecular ionization dynamics, all
three electronic degrees of freedom must be included. The
qualitative features are determined by interference effects re-

for r ≫ R. As seen from Fig. 3, the main part of the outgo-
ing wave follows the orientation of the ﬁeld. Hence we expect
that for parallel polarization, the main contributions will be
for ˆr parallel to R, which again gives raise to oscillations in
R with wave number k. Given that the one-photon ionization
2(ω − ˜Ip(R)),
dominates, we ﬁnd the wave number as k ≈
where ˜Ip is the effective ionization potential. This is seen to
be consistent with the results in Figs. 1 and 2 and we have
also conﬁrmed these ﬁndings for other values of ω. The ab-
sence of oscillations in the case for perpendicular polarization
is understood accordingly: The wave is sent out mainly in the
direction given by θ = 90 o, and since the outgoing waves will
have no phase difference due to the separation of the scatter-
ing centers in this direction, no interference pattern will occur
(ˆr · R = 0).

the electron spectra show that intense attosecond pulses can
resolve the instantaneous vibrational and orientational quan-
tum state of diatomic molecules.

The atomic parity non-conservation(PNC) experiments has reached accuracies which have im-
portant implications for physics beyond the standard model. An optical rotation experiment to
measure the atomic PNC of the 3P1(6s6p)−1 P1(6s6p) in Yb was proposed recently[1]. Our screened
electron-electron coulomb potential multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock calculation of th PNC induced
E1 transition amplitude of this transition E1PNC = −96.0 × 10−11iea0(−QW /N ) of 171Yb is more
than two orders of magnitude larger than E1PNC(6s−7s) = −0.8991×10−11iea0(−QW /N ) of 133Cs.

INTRODUCTION

The nuclear weak charge QW of an atom is a parameter
of the atomic PNC arising from the nucleon-electron vec-
tor axial vector interaction. It is possible to extract QW
by measuring the PNC induced electric dipole transition
amplitude E1PNC and combining it with atomic theory
calculations. The E1PNC of the 133Cs 6s
7s transi-
tion has been measured to very high accuracy[2]. The
QW of 133Cs obtained from the experimental data after
combining with the atomic theory calculations[3, 4] was
further reﬁned to 72.06(28)expt(34)theor after the mea-
surement of the 6s
7s transition polarizability[5]. This
has a 2.5σ deviation from the predictions of the stan-
dard model QW = 73.20(13)[6]. The uncertainty of the
experiment results and atomic theory calculations are es-
timated at .35% and 1% respectively. This indicate the
possibility of improving the results further by reducing
the atomic theory uncertainty.

The recent atomic theory calculations which treat the
Breit interaction more rigorously have introduced correc-
tions of .9%[7], .6%[8] and .4%[9] to QW of 133Cs. The
variation of the results is due to the diﬀerence of the cal-
culation methods and many-body eﬀects included. The
uncertainties of these calculations are estimated at 1%.
Considering the unique implications of the parameters
obtained from the atomic PNC phenomena to the physics
beyond the standard model, it is desirable to reduce the
atomic theory uncertainties and also conﬁrm the 133Cs
results using other atoms.

An important criteria of choosing a candidate atom is
the Z 3α scaling of the PNC interaction, which indicates

the advatage of choosing high Z atom. The 1S0 −

The 3P0 −

ied theoretically[10, 11, 12, 13] and experimentally[15,
is a promising candidate of the ongo-

ing and future atomic PNC experiments. This tran-
sition is a suitable choice due to the nearly degener-
ate 3D1(5d6s)(24489cm−1) and 1P1(6s6p)(25068cm−1),
which can enhance the PNC mixing. The PNC mixing

ploited in the 3P0 −
1 P1 transition was proposed for atomic PNC
experiment in a recent work[1] and estimates E1PNC ≈
10−10ea0 which is almost one order of magnitude

×
10−11ea0. The use
larger than that of 133Cs E1PNC ≈
of the metastable state 3P0 as the initial state oﬀers the
possibility of separating only the atomic density depen-
dent plane of polarization rotation angle from the wave-
length dependent systematic errors. This is expected to
better the results obtained from the Stark-interference
experiments, where the use of the high intensity laser
ﬁelds limits the statistical precision due to the light shift.
In this paper we have investigated the E1PNC of the
1 P1 transition using multi-conﬁguration Dirac-
3P0,1 −
Fock method. The atomic theory calculations are nec-
essary to extract the nuclear weak charge QW from the
experimental value of E1PNC. To check the accuracy
of the atomic calculations we also study the transition
properties and hyper ﬁne structure constants. All the
calculations are in atomic units ( ¯h = e = me = 1).

II. THE METHOD OF CALCULATION

The nuclear spin-independent atomic PNC arises from
the axial-vector vector electron-nucleon interaction com-
ponent of the neutral weak current interaction between
the electrons and nucleons of an atom. The interaction
is mediated by Z0 bosons, which is a prediction of the
electron-weak uniﬁcation. The eﬀective form of the in-
teraction Hamiltonian can be obtained by treating the

The numerator of (2.2) has H NSI

PNC, eﬀective only within
the nuclear region due to the nuclear density ρnuc(r) and
r in length gauge, which has signiﬁcant
the dipole D =
contribution from the large radial range. And the ener-
gies in the denominator has large contribution from the
mid radial range where the electron density is high. The
calculation of the E1NSI
PNC require atomic state functions
which are accurate over all radial ranges. E1PNC can be
calculated once the atomic wave-functions are known.

A. Wave-function Calculation

A method suitable for rare earth atoms which has large
conﬁguration mixing is the multi-conﬁguration Dirac-
Fock (MCDF), which is the relativistic adaptation of the
multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock. The MCDF approxi-
as a linear com-
mates an atomic state function

which are again a linear combination of Slater determi-
nants. Where P , J and M are the parity, total angu-
lar momentum and magnetic quantum numbers respec-
tively, and Γ and γ are the additional quantum numbers
required to deﬁned the ASF and CSFs uniquely. Then

where αi and βi are the Dirac matrices, pi is the momen-

then generated variationally. The orbitals from the neg-
ative continuum are also the solutions of such a method,
however only the bound states can be chosen by impos-
ing the boundary condition that the orbitals ψ(r)

r
. Choosing the ASFs contributing to the valence-
valence correlation eﬀects, the orbitals captures impor-
tant correlation eﬀects.

Though MCDF method can represent the valence-
valence correlation, it is not a suitable method to cal-
culate core-valence and core-core correlation eﬀects. A
large number of CSFs is required to represent these cor-
relation eﬀects, which is computationally diﬃcult as self
consistent ﬁeld method like MCDF is not suitable for a
calculation involving large CSF spaces. However, these
correlation eﬀects can be calculated using conﬁguration
interaction(CI) using a set of virtual orbitals generated
from the MCDF potential.

A large set of CSFs is required in the CI calculation to
represent all classes of correlation eﬀects. A more eﬃcient
method is to model it using the most important CSFs
and modifying the form of the electron-electron Coulomb
interaction potential as

where αK are the constants that modiﬁes the K th mul-
tipole of the inter electron Coulomb interaction poten-
tial. The suitable values of these constants can be ob-
tained by matching properties like excitation energies
calculated using this potential with the experimental
data. The earlier calculations have shown that, this ap-
proach can reproduce the experimental data to very good
agreement[10, 16]. The values of α are chosen such that
0. < αK < 1. and for consistency the screening parame-
ters are used in the MCDF calculations to generate the
orbitals.

B. Properties Calculation

The most important transition properties like oscilla-
tor strength, life time, polarizability, etc arise from the
electric dipole transition. And all of these depend on the
reduce matrix elements of the electric dipole operator.

proximation of the inter-electron electromagnetic inter-
action implies that it is not gauge invariant. However,
the gauge invariance is restored if the inter-electron elec-
tromagnetic interaction is represented completely by in-
cluding the correlation eﬀects correctly. The agreement
of the dipole matrix elements or transition properties cal-
culated in diﬀerent gauges indicate the completeness of
the correlation eﬀects included, which can also be inter-
preted as the accuracy of the wave-functions.

The hyperﬁne constants are the measure of the
strength of the electron-nucleus parity allowed electro-
magnetic multipole interactions. The general form of the
interaction Hamiltonian is

where T (k) and M (k) are spherical tensor operators of
rank k in the electron and nuclear space respectively.
These represent the electromagnetic multipoles. The k =
1 and 2 corresponding to the magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole respectively are the most important. The
atomic states are then the eigenstates of the total angular
momentum

valence-valence correlation eﬀects. However, it is not
suitable to capture the core-valence and core-core cor-

CI calculations within the CSF space having excitations
from the core and valence shells to the virtual can capture
these correlation eﬀects. The virtual orbitals required
for the CI calculation is generated in layers, where one
layer is a set of orbitals of s, p, d, f and g symmetries
having same principal quantum number. Higher angular

are given in TableV. The results of earlier calculations
are also given in the table. The sequence of the excita-
tion energies are correct but the diviation from the ex-
perimental values is still large. However, the level 1P1 is
better than the coupled-cluster results and the hyperﬁne
constant of the same level is in better agreement with
the experimental data. The important reduced matrix
elements of the electric dipole are given in the Table:VI.

Matter X waves

(Dated: January 3, 2014)

We predict that an ultra-cold Bose gas in an optical lattice can give rise to a new form of
condensation, namely matter X waves. These are non-spreading 3D wave-packets which reﬂect
the symmetry of the Laplacian with a negative eﬀective mass along the lattice direction, and are
allowed to exist in the absence of any trapping potential even in the limit of non-interacting atoms.
This result has also strong implications for optical propagation in periodic structures.

PACS numbers:

Matter waves are a natural manifestation of large scale
coherence of an ensemble of atoms populating a funda-
mental quantum state. The observation of Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) in dilute ultra-cold alkalis [1] has
initiated the exploration of many intriguing properties of
matter waves, whose mascroscopic behavior can be suc-
cessfully described via mean-ﬁeld approach in terms of
a single complex wave-function with well deﬁned phase
across the atom cloud [2]. Large scale coherence eﬀects
are usually observed by means of 3D magnetic or optical
conﬁning potentials (also 1D cigar-like or 2D disk-shaped
BEC are possible [3]) in which BECs are described by
their ground-state wave-function However, trapping can
also occur in free space (i.e. without a trap) through the
mutual compensation of the leading-order (two-body) in-
teraction potential and kinetic energy, leading to bright
(dark) solitons for negative (positive) scattering lengths.
This phenomenon has been observed only in 1D (i.e., soli-
ton waveguides, a trap conﬁning the BEC transversally
to the soliton) [4]. In 2D and 3D, free-space localization
cannot occur due to collapse instability of solitons, and
even in a trap collapse usually prevents stable formation
of BEC [5, 6], needing stabilizing mechanisms [7].

A lot of attention was also devoted to periodic po-
tentials due to optical lattices [8], where the behavior of
atom mimic those of electrons in crystals or photons in
periodic media [9], and exhibit eﬀects which stem from
genuine atom coherence [10]. In 1D (elongated) lattices
bright (gap) solitons can form also in the presence of re-
pulsive interactions [11].
In this letter we predict that
a novel trapping phenomenon occurs when the full 3D
dynamics is retained in a 1D lattice. Speciﬁcally, un-
der the conditions for which the Bloch state associated
with the lattice has a negative eﬀective mass, the natural
state of the BEC is a localized matter X wave character-
ized by a peculiar bi-conical shape. The atoms are or-
ganized in this way in the absence of any trap, solely as
the result of the strong anisotropy between the 1D mod-
ulation and the free-motion in the 2D transverse plane.
Furthermore, due to axial symmetry, the atoms can ex-
perience a collective motion with given velocity along the
lattice, resulting into wave-packets traveling undistorted.
Remarkably, these matter X waves are not only observ-

able individually, but allow also to describe physically
realizable BECs as their superposition, each component
maintaining a constant (in time) number of atoms.

The very ﬁrst step of our derivation is similar to that
of matter gap solitons. Starting from the (mean-ﬁeld)

coupling between ψf and ψb causes the structure to be
strongly dispersive near band-edge and the linear dynam-
ics of atoms to be governed by strong Bragg reﬂection.
Nevertheless, in the 1D limit (η = 0), where Eqs. (3) were
obtained previously [11], the nonlinearity (both attrac-
tive a < 0 and repulsive a > 0) induces self-transparency
mediated by a two-parameter family of moving bright gap
solitons, so-called because they exist in the gap seen in
the soliton moving frame [12]. In the attractive case, one
might think that the nonlinearity can balance also the ki-
netic transverse term
⊥ leading to bell-shaped 3D atom
wave-packets [13]. We show in the following that, con-
trary to this expectation, close to the lower band edge
E = E−, the atomic wave-function takes a completely
diﬀerent form. To this end we apply a standard enve-
lope function (or eﬀective mass [15]) approximation [14],

allows us to use dimensionless variables. In the attractive
case (a < 0), Eq. (6) admits matter X waves solutions of
the kind φ = ϕ(r, z) exp(iµt), where ϕ(r, z) is indeed an
X-shaped invariant envelope [17]. Notice that X waves,
well known in optics [18], acoustics [19], or microwaves
[20], as non-spreading (in space and time) solutions of
the linear Helmotz wave equation [21], have been only re-
cently discovered for Sch¨odinger-type models of the form
of Eq.
(6), by analyzing the so-called paraxial (linear
[22] or nonlinear [17]) propagation in dispersive media.
However, we emphasize that, while an optical or acous-
tic ﬁeld retains a directly observable spatio-temporal X-
shape [17, 18], in the case of a Bose gas, the local density

To assess further the regimes of observability of matter
X waves, we discuss two crucial issues. First, by extend-
ing the analysis of Ref. [17], we are able to show that X
wave solutions of Eq. (6) exist also in the (far more com-
mon) case of repulsive nonlinearity (a > 0). As an exam-
ple, we display in Fig. 1 the atom density corresponding
to the stationary solution with eigenvalue µ = 0, which
shows a dense core accompanied by bi-conically shaped
regions of lower density. As shown in the insets, the sig-
nature of the X-shape is a single peak on-axis (r = 0)

axis (r = 7) longitudinal proﬁles of the overall (|ψ|2, black)
and envelope (|φ|2, red) densities. We ﬁx z0 = 10/k to have
dimensionless units.

X-shaped BECs can be formed also in an ideal noninter-
acting gas (a = 0), which is realizable by exploiting Fesh-
bach resonance [4]. This is in contrast with other known
settings where BEC needs either a conﬁning potential
(as in pioneering experiments [1]), or the nonlinearities
to balance kinetic spreading. Ultimately, this stems from
the fact that X waves have a ﬁnite linear limit, unlike soli-
tons of standard (elliptic) GP equation whose amplitude
0. To demonstrate, however, that linear
vanishes as a
matter X waves are observable, we need to address the
fundamental issue of their norm ﬁniteness. To this end
let us solve Eq. (6) in dimensionless form with a = 0

Clearly, most of physically relevant wave-packets belong
to the class φΣ [26]. For example a spectrally narrow
gaussian beam can be described by few X waves (details
will be given elsewhere).

Once the existence of ﬁnite norm linear X waves is
established together with their potential to describe gen-
eral BECs, the most intriguing question remains whether
we can expect matter X-shaped atom distributions to
be observable. Such waves correspond to a single ﬁxed
value q = ¯q in Eq. (15) and an ideal velocity distribution
C¯q(v) = δ(v
¯v). However, more generally, we can con-
sider an atomic envelope beam φa constituted by several
replicas of the single X wave φ⊥
¯q travelling with diﬀerent
velocities. Although, strictly speaking, such beam is not
stationary, it can approximate such a state with an ar-
bitrary degree of accuracy. In other words, it is possible
to construct solutions that preserve their shape, for an
arbitrary long time. Indeed if C¯q(v) is a narrow function,
e.g. peaked around v = 0, Eq. (15), using also Eq. (8),
yields the following atom envelope φa

Eq. (18) represents an X wave modulated by a dispers-
ing wave, which gives a sort of adiabatic dynamics of the
ﬁnite norm X wave. Indeed the atom beam has an in-
variant spatial shape ﬁxed by ϕ⊥
¯q , which we display in
Fig. 2 as an example for ¯q = 0. It spreads on a charac-
teristic time which is longer, the narrower is the velocity
distribution function Cq(v). Finally, while in the linear
regime we expect that such atom states should be some-
how prepared, we envisage that atom collisions (nonlin-
ear regime) can strongly favour the formation of X waves
from more conventional ball-shaped atom clouds (e.g.,
obtained by a harmonic 3D trap which is then switched
oﬀ) through instability mechanisms [17, 23], an issue
which will be deepened elsewhere.

In conclusion we have shown that a periodic poten-
tial supports moving or still localized states of the GP
model with envelope X-shape (strictly or nearly) pre-
served upon motion. A matter X waves entails local-
ization both in momentum and conﬁguration space and
is a clear signature of a Bose condensed gas, so much as
the anisotropy in the distribution function [2] detected
in early experiments. However, unlike any other form of
BEC including solitons, matter X waves can be observed
in free-space and in the non-interacting regime, where
they constitute a natural basis of expansion to describe
the coherent properties of atom wave-packets. These re-
sults have strong implications also in optics, where the
model (7) holds for normally dispersive bulk media [22],
or in nonlinear optics of stratiﬁed media where Eqs. (3)
describe propagation in a 1D bulk grating in the pres-

Abstract

It is shown by theoretical simulation that tuning of the pump power can induce mixing and

crossing of Autler-Townes(A-T) components of closely spaced transitions in atoms. Pump

radiation also leads to small shifts of the central hole of A-T doublet. Oﬀ-resonance pumping

gives an asymmetry in the A-T components and by controlling pump frequency detuning it

is also possible to mix the A-T components.

I Introduction:

The interaction of a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld with two, three and four-level atomic sys-

tems leads to many interesting nonlinear eﬀects like electromagnetically induced transparency

(EIT) [1,2], lasing without inversion(LWI) [3,4] and enhancement or suppression of atomic re-

fractive index [5,6,7]. The strong pump ﬁeld leads to the dynamic(ac) Stark splitting or Autler-

Townes(A-T) splitting [8], in this case the system is said to be dressed by the strong pump ﬁeld.

This energy level splitting is well resolved when the Rabi-frequency of the pump ﬁeld is larger

than the atomic decay rates. Detailed studies on the splitting have been carried out by many

researchers both experimentally and theoretically [9-13]. In the weak probe limit this well known

nonlinear eﬀect has drawn much attention in recent years after successful achievement of EIT and

LWI in various atomic vapor systems [2,10,14-15].

Interaction of atomic systems having closely spaced energy levels with electromagnetic ra-

diations leads to interesting eﬀect on the line shape of the observed spectra [16-19]. Schl¨ossberg

and Javan [16] ﬁrst studied the interaction of a three level system(TLS) having two closely spaced

upper levels with two incident radiation ﬁelds with two closely spaced monochromatic frequencies

separated by an amount larger than the natural line widths of the atomic resonances. Double reso-

nance line shape arising from the interaction of a four-level atomic system with two closely spaced

intermediate levels under the inﬂuence of a ﬁxed pump frequency has been studied [17]. Almost

all of the theoretical and experimental work on A-T eﬀect deal with the three level systems(TLS)
2 + 4|χ|2 [10]
and in a TLS two peaks of the A-T doublet occur at probe detunings δ1 = δ2
where δ2 and χ are the pump detuning and pump Rabi-frequency respectively. If pump frequency
is on-resonance (δ2 = 0) the two symmetric peaks appear at δ1 = ±χ with identical linewidths.
For non-zero detuning, the peaks are asymmetric and one peak has larger linewidth, while the

2 ± 1

δ2

q

2

other has smaller linewidth. This change of linewidth occurs in such a way that the sum of the

linewidths is equal to the unperturbed linewidth of the A-T components [10].

Hyperﬁne transitions in alkaline atoms like Rubidium are widely used for laser cooling [20].

Rb-D2 hyperﬁne transitions of both the isotopes involve a single lower level and three closely
spaced upper levels. Recently we reported [21] a theoretical simulation based on rate equations of

a four level atom with a common ground level and three closely spaced upper levels interacting with

a standing wave. They were solved numerically to show the diﬃculty of isolating the components

in Lamb dip spectroscopy. Eﬀect of pump Rabi frequency and detuning on A-T components of

atomic system with three closely spaced upper levels, commonly found in the hyperﬁne splitting of

alkali atoms, has not been studied theoretically earlier. Here we present a perturbative analytical

treatment of such a system with the pump frequency held near resonance with one of the hyperﬁne
transitions (Fg = 2 → Fe = 1 for 85Rb-D2). It leads to Autler-Townes splitting of the two closely
spaced probe transitions (Fg = 2 → Fe = 2 and 3). It is found that tuning of the pump power
with on resonance pump frequency results in mixing and crossing of the A-T components in 85Rb.

At higher pump power the mixing of the A-T components leads to a signiﬁcant outward shift in

the holes created by the overlap of the A-T doublets. Eﬀect of oﬀ-resonance pumping on the line

shape of the A-T components is also discussed.

II Theory:

The four-level system (Fig. 1) with energy levels E1, E2, E3 and E4 interacts with two
coherent monochromatic radiation ﬁelds of frequencies Ω1 and Ω2. The strong pump frequency
Ω1 is nearly equal to transition frequency ω1 = (E2−E1)
, and the ﬁeld Ω2 probes the transitions 1
→ 3 and 1 → 4 with the transition frequencies ω2 = (E3−E1)

and ω3 = (E4−E1)

respectively.

The Hamiltonian of the system can be written as

H = H0 + HI

where H0 is the unperturbed atomic Hamiltonian with the eigenvalues E1, E2, E3 and E4.

HI is the interacting Hamiltonian of the four-level system and can be written as

HI = −2ε1µ cos Ω1t − 2ε2µ cos Ω2t

where the ε1 and ε2 are the electric-ﬁeld amplitudes of the pump and probe radiations respectively
and µ is the transition dipole moment. In a semiclassical treatment for the atom-ﬁeld interaction
we deﬁne the Rabi-frequencies as χ1 = 2µ12ε1

and χ3 = 2µ14ε2

, χ2 = 2µ13ε2

The detunings are deﬁned as ∆ω1 = (Ω1 - ω1), ∆ω2 = (Ω2 - ω2) and ∆ω3 = (Ω2 - ω3) and
the energy level diﬀerences are ∆1 = (E3−E2)
, ∆2 = (E4−E2)
. We introduce T1,
T2 as the longitudinal and transverse relaxation constants. Under the eﬀect of the applied ﬁeld a
macroscopic polarization will be developed in the system, which can be written as

where N is the number of atoms per unit volume. This allows us to introduce the real and

imaginary parts of the pump and probe polarizations associated with the three allowed transitions,
given by Ppr + i Ppi = Nµ21ρ12, Psr1 + i Psi1 = Nµ31ρ13 and Psr2 + i Psi2 = Nµ41ρ14. The population
diﬀerences are ∆N1 = N(ρ11 − ρ22), ∆N2 = N(ρ11 − ρ33), and ∆N3 = N(ρ11 − ρ44). They relax to
o with relaxation time T1. The transitions 2 ⇀↽ 3, 2 ⇀↽ 4 and 3 ⇀↽ 4 are not
∆N1
induced by any radiation but ρ23, ρ24 and ρ34 are not equal to zero. This will involve the non-linear
terms given by Pnr + i Pni = Nρ23µ31, Pmr + i Pmi = Nµ41µ12ρ24 and Pqr + i Pqi = Nµ41µ13ρ34.

Fifteen steady-state optical Bloch equations can be written in terms of polarizations, population

diﬀerences and the non-linear parameters.

III Line Shape of the Probe transitions:

The analytical expression of the total probe polarization, is the sum of Psi1 and Psi2. The
analytical closed forms of the Psi1 and Psi2 are very complicated, and to get a simpliﬁed form we
consider the relaxation parameters T1 = T2 = T and probe Rabi-frequencies χ2 = χ3 = χp. Since
pump electric ﬁeld amplitude is much greater than the probe electric ﬁeld amplitude; i.e., ε1 >>
ε2 we get χ1 >> χp.

The probe polarization in zeroth order is

Eq.(6) gives a Lorentzian line shape centered at ∆ω2 = 0, when we increase the power
of pump-beam it is split into two symmetrical components which are commonly known as A-T

doublet [8]. Similar result will be obtained from the second term of eq.(5). The separation of the
A-T components increases with increase in the value of χ1T . They are not observed at lower value
of χ1T .

IV Computation of line shape in Rubidium atom:

For the purpose of numerical calculations we have chosen a four-level system that corre-
sponding to 85Rb−D2 hyperﬁne transitions (Fig. 1). The lower energy level 1 corresponds to the
ground state of 85Rb−D2, while the upper levels 2, 3 and 4 are
Fg = 2 hyperﬁne level in 5S 1
the Fe = 1, 2, 3 components of the 5P 3
excited state. The energy level diﬀerences in the upper
states of 85Rb are ∆1 = 0.029GHz, ∆2 = 0.092GHz and ∆3 = 0.063GHz respectively. The value
of the pump frequency used in this work is 384615.38 GHz(λ ≈ 780.0nm). The values of pump

2

2

Rabi-frequencies used for computation are very close to the experimental situation of Rb vapor
system [11,24]. We choose the value of relaxation constants 1

Fig. 2A shows the probe polarization vs. detuning

curve, for two diﬀerent

pump powers when the pump frequency is held on-resonance with the transition 1 → 2. The

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

pump ﬁeld Rabi-frequencies used in Fig. 2A are 0.01 and 0.04 GHz. At low pump Rabi-frequency

two absorption lines appear corresponding to 1 → 3 and 1 → 4 transitions (Fig. 2A(a)) when the

probe is tuned across the lines. As we increase the pump Rabi-frequency keeping Γ constant the

two absorption lines become power broadened and each line is split into two A-T components

T = Γ = 0.01GHz [11].
Ω2 − (ω2+ω3)

2

(Fig. 2A(b)) denoted as (A1, A2) and (B1, B2).

It is observed that at a pump Rabi-frequency of 0.06GHz the nearby split components of

two A-T doublets corresponding to the transitions 1 → 3 and 1 → 4 are mixed with each other
(A2 and B1 of Fig. 2B). This mixing occurs at a frequency (ω2+ω3)
absorption line. Thus one can obtain three A-T components instead of four (Fig. 2B(a)). In order

and forms a single stronger

2

to ﬁnd the eﬀect of the ﬁnite probe power the probe polarization(eq.7) is plotted in Fig. 2B(b),
the values of χ1 and Γ remain unchanged; value of χp is 0.006GHz. The eﬀect of the ﬁnite probe
power is revealed as a small change of line shape.

In Fig. 2C we see the eﬀect of further higher pump powers on the absorption line. At

pump Rabi-frequency 0.1GHz the central line of Fig. 2B is again split and they cross the zero

detuning line (Fig. 2C(a)). With further increase in pump power the separation between two A-T

components increases but they never mix again. As a consequence positions of the holes produced

by the A-T splitting also shifts with pump power, this is observed after they cross the zero probe

detuning.

In Fig. 3 we present two spectra (A,B) where we show the eﬀect of oﬀ-resonance pumping

on the probe absorption. In both the spectra (A,B) dotted curve(a) shows the probe absorption
when ∆ω1 = 0 and χ1 = 0.03GHz and it leads to the two A-T doublets corresponding to two
allowed transitions. The solid curve(b) of Fig. 3A plotted with χ1 = 0.03 and ∆ω1 = -0.012 GHz
gives four A-T peaks with asymmetric linewidths because of the non-zero detuning of the pump

ﬁeld. A-T components A1 and B1 are weaker and have lower linewidth than A2 and B2. We can
control the pump detuning in such a way that at a value of -0.026GHz the A-T component(B1)

of 1 → 4 transition nearly mixes with the A-T component(A2) of the 1 → 3 transition (Fig. 3B)
solid curve(b). So by controlling the pump detuning (i.e. coherent control) we are able to mix

the nearby A-T component keeping pump power ﬁxed. In both the cases mentioned above the

sum of the linewidths of two A-T components is equal to the unperturbed linewidth [10] for each

transition.

V Conclusions:

The power-broadened A-T doublets in a four-level system interacting with a near resonant

strong pump and a weak probe ﬁeld have been investigated by analytical solution of the optical
Bloch equations. Numerical computation of the line shape of 85Rb-D2 transitions is reported.
In a four level system two A-T doublets are generally expected in the presence of a pump. Our

calculation of the A-T splitting in a four-level system with three closely spaced upper levels reveals

that the pump power can be tuned so that the nearby A-T components of two nearby transitions

mix with each other. Such mixing of the A-T components may also be achived by varying detuning

of the pump frequency. Further increase of pump power will cause the mixed components to split

again and they cross to the other sides of the mean frequency resulting in four components. It

is noteworthy that the positions of the holes of the A-T doublets shifts with increase of pump

Rabi-frequency. This results from increased A-T splitting. So one can manipulate the atomic

response through pump ﬁeld either by pump power or by pump detuning. We also performed the
computation with another 85Rb-D2 transitions (i.e. Fg = 3 → Fe = 2, 3, 4) where the upper state
hyperﬁne energy level spacings are higher than there of the 85Rb-D2 transitions corresponding to
Fg = 2 → Fe = 1, 2, 3. In this case much higher pump power is required for the level mixing.

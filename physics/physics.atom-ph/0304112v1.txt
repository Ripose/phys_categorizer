Abstract
Stripping cross sections in nitrogen have been calculated using the classical trajectory approxi-
mation and the Born approximation of quantum mechanics for the outer shell electrons of 3.2GeV
I− and Cs+ ions. A large diﬀerence in cross section, up to a factor of six, calculated in quan-
tum mechanics and classical mechanics, has been obtained. Because at such high velocities the
Born approximation is well validated, the classical trajectory approach fails to correctly predict
the stripping cross sections at high energies for electron orbitals with low ionization potential.

INTRODUCTION

Ion-atom ionizing collisions play an important role in many applications, such as heavy
ion inertial fusion [1], collisional and radiative processes in the Earth’s upper atmosphere
[2], ion-beam lifetimes in accelerators [3], atomic spectroscopy [4] and ion stopping in matter
[5], and are also of considerable academic interest in atomic physics [6].

To estimate the ionization and stripping rates of fast ions propagating through gas or
plasma, the values of ion-atom ionization cross sections are necessary. In contrast to the
electron [7] and proton [8, 9] ionization cross sections, where experimental data or theoretical
calculations exist for practically any ion and atom, the knowledge of ionization cross sections
by fast complex ions and atoms is far from complete [10]. While speciﬁc values of the cross
sections for various pairs of projectile ions and target atoms have been measured at several
energies [11, 12, 13], the scaling of cross sections with energy and target or projectile nucleus
charge has not been experimentally mapped.

There are several theoretical approaches to cross section calculations. These include:
classical calculations that make use of a classical trajectory and the atomic electron velocity
distribution functions given by quantum mechanics [this approach is frequently referred to
as the classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) approach]; quantum mechanical calcula-
tions based on the Born, eikonal or quasiclassical approximations, and so forth [10]. All
approaches are computationally intensive, and the error and range of validity have to be
assessed carefully before making any approximations or applying the results.

Classical trajectory calculations are simpler to perform in comparison with quantum me-
chanical calculations. Moreover, in some cases the CTMC calculations yield results close to
the quantum mechanical calculations [11, 14, 15]. The reason for similar results lies in the
fact that the Rutherford scattering cross section is identical in both classical and quantum
mechanical derivations [16]. Therefore, when an ionizing collision is predominantly a conse-
quence of electron scattering at small impact parameters close to the nucleus, the quantum
mechanical uncertainty in the scattering angle is small compared with the angle itself, and
the classical calculation can yield an accurate description [17, 18]. But this is not always a
case, as we demonstrate below. For fast projectile velocities and low ionization potentials,
the diﬀerence between the classical and quantum mechanical calculations of ionization cross
section can be as large as a factor of six for parameters to relevant to heavy ion fusion cross
sections.

In the present analysis, we consider at ﬁrst only the stripping cross section of loosely
bound electron orbitals of I − and Cs+ ions colliding with a neutral atom of nitrogen, or
with a fully stripped nitrogen ion with ZT = 7 (for comparison). Atomic units are used
throughout this paper with e = ~ = me = 1, which corresponds to length normalized to
a0 = ~2/(mee2) = 0.529 · 10−8cm, velocity normalized to v0 = e2/~ = 2.19 · 108cm/s, and
energy normalized to E0 = mev2
0 = 2Ry = 27.2eV , where Ry is the Rydberg energy. The
normalizing coeﬃcients are retained in all equations for robust application of the formulas.
For eﬃcient manipulation of the formulas, it is worth noting that the normalized veloc-
ity is v/v0 = 0.2
E[keV /amu], where E is energy per nucleon in keV /amu. Therefore,
25keV /amu corresponds to the atomic velocity scale.

The typical scale for the electron orbital velocity with ionization potential Inl is vnl =
v0
2Inl/E0. Here, n, l is the standard notation for the main quantum number and the
orbital angular momentum quantum number [16]. The collision dynamics is very diﬀerent
depending on whether v is smaller or larger than vnl.

PclP (q) in Eq.(3)] and the eﬀective charges [ZquT (q) NeT (q) in Eq.(7), and ZclT (q) in Eq.(10)] in
quantum and classical mechanics for 3.2GeV I − ions colliding with a nitrogen atom. Ionization of
only the outer electron shell is considered (here, InlP = 3eV ).

II. BEHAVIOR OF CROSS SECTIONS AT LARGE VALUES OF PROJECTILE
VELOCITY v > vnl

When v >> vnl, the projectile interaction with the target atom occurs for a very short
time, and the interaction time decreases as the velocity increases. For 3.2GeV I − ions,
envisioned for heavy ion fusion applications, the projectile velocity in atomic units is 32v0,
while the electron orbital velocity is vnl = 0.5v0 for the ﬁrst (3.06eV ) ionization potential of
I −, and vnl = 1.3v0 for the ﬁrst (22.4eV ) ionization potential of Cs+. Therefore, we shall
use the limit v >> vnl.

In the limit, where v > v0ZT and v >> vnl, the Born approximation of quantum me-
chanics can be used [14, 16]. The ﬁrst inequality assures that the nitrogen atomic potential
can be taken into account as a small perturbation (the Born approximation); the second
inequality allows us to use the unperturbed atomic wave function.

In both classical mechanics and in the Born approximation, the ionization cross section

can be recast in the form [10, 15, 19, 20],

In quantum mechanics, PquP (q) can be expressed by the square of the corresponding

Figure 2 shows that for stripping by neutral atoms, the main contributions arise from in-
termediate momenta in the range q = 0.5 − 1, while for stripping by the bare target nucleus,
small values of q make the largest contribution to the cross section, which corresponds to
large impact parameters (due to the Coulomb long-range interaction). Because PquP > PclP
for q << 1, but ZquT < ZclT (q), the quantum mechanical cross sections are larger than the
classical stripping cross sections for stripping by the bare nucleus, but smaller than the clas-
sical stripping cross sections for the atoms. Carrying out the integration in Eq. (1) gives the
stripping cross sections for only one electron from the outer electron shell for diﬀerent ions
with the same velocity v = 32v0 colliding with a nitrogen atom. The results are shown in
Table 1 for 3.2GeV I − ions; in Table 2 for 3.35GeV Cs+ ions; and in Table 3 for 25MeV H −.

Figure 3 shows the same results as in Fig.2, but the results are obtained for 3.35GeV Cs+
ions (ionization of only one outer electron shell is considered here with InlP = 22.4eV ).
Note that 3.35GeV Cs+ is chosen to have the same velocity as a 3.2GeV I − ion.

In the limit v >> vnl, the stripping cross section by a fully stripped ion can be analytically
evaluated. The Bohr formula, derived by means of classical mechanics, neglects the electron
atomic velocity, and gives for the cross section [17]

FIG. 3: Plots of the diﬀerential cross sections of ionization for Cs+ and I − ions by nitrogen atoms
and fully stripped ions.

The results of cross sections calculations using Eq.(12) with a factor 5/3 and the result
in Eq.(13) coincide with the results in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of stripping cross sections by a
fully stripped nitrogen ions calculated in classical trajectory approximation and the Born
approximation of quantum mechanics, respectively.

The stripping cross sections calculated in classical trajectory approximation for Cs+ and
I − ions by fully stripped nitrogen ions is only factor 2-3 larger than the stripping cross
sections by neutral nitrogen atoms, which is in qualitative agreement with the observations
in Ref.[12]. However, there is a large diﬀerence, up to a factor 30, in the stripping cross
sections calculated in the Born approximation of quantum mechanics.

It is evident that the stripping of Cs+ ions by fully stripped nitrogen ions decreases by
a factor of 22.4eV /3eV = 7.5 compared with I − ions, which is in agreement with the Bohr
[Eq.(12)] and Bethe [Eq.(13)] formulas. The stripping cross sections for Cs+ and I −ions
by neutral nitrogen atoms diﬀer by only a factor of 2. In classical mechanics, because the
interaction potential is a strong function of the separation, to transfer a considerably larger
momentum requires a rather small decrease in impact parameter. This is why, notwith-
standing the large diﬀerence in ionization potential by a factor of 7, the diﬀerence between
the two cross sections is only a factor of 2. Table 3 shows that the diﬀerence between the
quantum and classical treatments increases for smaller ionization potentials (compare Table
3 with Table 1).

The reason for such a large diﬀerence between the quantum mechanical and classical
mechanical stripping cross sections for I − can be easily understood from the example of
elastic electron scattering from the shielded Coulomb potential U(r) = exp(−r/a0)/r. The
diﬀerential cross section for elastic scattering is shown in Fig.4 . For the shielded Coulomb

integrating
the quantum mechanical cross section departs from the Rutherford scattering formula for
q/(mev0) < 1, whereas the classical mechanical cross section departs from the Rutherford
scattering formula only for q/(mev0) < 2v0/v [see Eq.(9) and Fig.4]. Therefore, the classical
diﬀerential cross section diﬀers from the quantum mechanical result by a factor of [v/(2v0)]4,
which for v = 32v0 gives a diﬀerence in small-angle diﬀerential cross section of up to a factor
of 104 (see Fig.4).

Tables 4 and 5 are similar to Tables 1 and 2, but the calculations are carried out for ion
energies 30 times smaller, in the range of 100MeV. Table 5 shows that the predictions of the
classical and quantum mechanical theories are similar for 100MeV ions. However, they are
a factor two diﬀerent for I − ions, and the cross sections are the same within 10% accuracy
for Cs+ ions. The contribution from small q to the stripping cross section by a neutral
nitrogen atom is smaller for Cs+ ions than for I − ions, thereby signiﬁcantly reducing the
stripping cross section of Cs+ ions compared with I − ions, especially for the calculation in
the classical trajectory approximation (see Tables 4 and 5, and Fig.5).

which is a convenient expression to use to determine the ion conﬁnement time in an accel-
erator. In the limit v >> vnl, the calculation of the total stripping cross section can be
performed assuming that the stripping from diﬀerent electron orbitals occurs independently

Here, nl denotes the atomic orbital quantum numbers, Inl is the ionization potential in
eV, and σnl denotes the individual cross section for an orbital electron in units of 10−16cm2.
The sum over all orbitals gives σtotal = 1.1 · 10−16cm2 for 3.2GeV I − ions. To correctly
account for multiple ionization, the inclusion of multi-electron eﬀects is necessary. This will
be addressed in a future publication. However, it is clear that the stripping cross section for
any degree of ionization by neutral atoms is limited by the geometrical cross section of the
atom (the geometrical cross section of a nitrogen atom is much smaller than the geometrical
cross section of a Cs+ ion or a I −ion [22]). The nitrogen atom geometric cross section is
σN = 1.5 · 10−16cm2[22], and therefore σ < σN is expected. Preliminary estimates suggest
that single electron stripping is expected under these conditions.

For 105MeV I − ions, however, the sum over all orbitals gives σtotal = 33 · 10−16cm2,
whereas σN = 1.5 · 10−16cm2. This indicates that multi-electron ionization is expected.
However, it is clear that the stripping cross section for any degree of ionization is limited
from above by σN = 1.5 · 10−16cm2.

The structure of the electron orbitals for Cs+ ions, and the individual cross sections for
an orbital electron in units of 10−16cm2 are illustrated in Table 7. Note that a Cs+ ion has
the same number of electrons on each orbital as a I − ion.

For 3.35GeV Cs+ ions colliding with a nitrogen atom with velocity v = 32v0
(25MeV /amu), the summation in Eq.(17) over all orbitals gives σtotal = 0.72·10−16cm2. This

for 25MeV /amu Xe+. Note that the factor of three diﬀerence between the results presented
in Table 7 and the results in Ref.[12] is due to the fact that the cross sections in Table 7

10

are predicted by making use of quantum mechanics, whereas results in Ref.[12] are classical
trajectory calculations, not applicable at such high projectile velocities.

For 110MeV Cs+ ions colliding with a nitrogen atom, v = 5.75v0 (0.8Mev/amu) and the
summation over all orbitals in Eq.(17) gives σtotal = 21 · 10−16cm2, whereas the geometrical
cross section of a nitrogen atom is only σN = 1.5 · 10−16cm2 << σtotal. This indicates
that multi-electron ionization is expected, similar to I − ions at the same velocity. As noted
earlier, to correctly account for multiple ionization, multi-electron calculations are necessary.
However, it is clear that the stripping cross section σ for any degree ionization is limited
by σN = 1.5 · 10−16cm2. This estimate of the cross section is consistent with Olson’s result
[12], σtotal = 4 · 10−16cm2 for 2MeV /amu Xe+. The inequality σtotal > σN indicates the
important eﬀect of multi-electron events.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

For low ionization potential, where a small momentum transfer q contributes to stripping,
the classical approach is not valid. For 3.2GeV I − ions, the classical trajectory approach
overestimates by a factor of six the stripping cross section by atomic nitrogen, and by a
factor of two the stripping cross section of 3.35GeV Cs+ ions. For 110MeV Cs+ ions and
105MeV I − ions colliding with a nitrogen atom at velocity v = 5.75v0 (0.8Mev/amu),
multi-electron ionization is expected. For a correct description of multiple ionization, multi-
electron calculations are necessary. However, it is clear that the stripping cross section for
any degree of ionization is limited from above by the geometrical cross section of nitrogen,
with σN = 1.5 · 10−16cm2, and should be be similar in magnitude for I − ions and Cs+ ions
at energies in the 100MeV range. (The geometrical cross section of a nitrogen atom is much
smaller than the geometrical cross section of a Cs+ ion or a I −ion [22]. This eﬀect is similar
to the hole produced by a bullet piercing a paper target, where the hole size is determined
by the bullet cross section, not by the paper target.)

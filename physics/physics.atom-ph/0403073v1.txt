INTRODUCTION

Collisions of atoms at ultracold temperatures have re-
ceived considerable attention because of their importance
in the cooling and trapping of atoms [1]and molecules
[2] and Bose Einstein condensation by Sympathetic cool-
ing [3]. Ultracold mixtures of alkali metal atoms have
recently been the subject of intensive experimental re-
search, therefore the interest in the detailed knowledge
of ultracold mixtures of alkali atoms has theoretically in-
creased [4, 5]. Even, while collisions either between alkali
often same species or between diﬀerent isotopes have of-
ten been well characterized [6], collision between diﬀerent
alkali species have a still intensive exploring ﬁeld. The
condensed atoms and molecules may form a two-species
Bose-Einstein condensate in which a new class of coher-
ent phenomena is predicted to occur [7].

In an ultracold mixture, the interaction between the
components is described in terms of a very important
parameter, the interspecies s-wave scattering length.
The character of the interaction between diﬀerent alkali
species in low-temperatures is determined by signs (
)
±
for bosonic
and magnitude of the scattering length a:
atom with a>0 Bose condensate is stable, for a<0 it is
unstable [8]. This parameter also determines the eﬃ-
ciency of the sympathetic cooling procedure [3]. In addi-
tion, knowledge of the scattering length is important in
order to predict macroscopic properties of these mixed
systems, such as the stability and phase separation of bi-
nary degenerate systems, or microscopic properties, such
as the occurrence of resonances and the cross section and
the spin-charge cross section in the interspecies collisions.

Accurate calculations of s-wave scattering length and
eﬀective range for diatomic potentials are important due

to the elastic collisions in these temperatures dominated
s-wave scattering. In recent years, these quantities have
been calculated by several theoretical methods [9, 10, 11,
12, 13]. The accurate determination of scattering length
depends on choosing the interaction potentials. Collision

processes at near- zero temperatures (
to the details of the interaction potentials between the
colliding systems.

Previous theoretical and experimental calculations of
the scattering length for Rb+K interaction have ap-
peared in the literatures [3, 14]. The purpose of this
paper, we are to calculate scattering lengths, eﬀective
ranges and phase shifts-cross section for the collisions of
Rb+K at ultra-cold temperatures with the Semiclassical
method (WKB) [15] and also solve the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion using Numerov method numerically [16]. We have
investigated the convergence of some scattering proper-
ties obtained with help of these methods as the depen-
dence of a K 0 parameter using Quantum Defect The-
ory [13]. The interaction of rubidium-potassium atoms
+
in states (1
u ) is described by short and
long range potentials which includes the cutoﬀ functions
introduced to truncate the unphysical short-range contri-
bution of the polarization potential near the origin[17].
Cutoﬀ functions depending on the cutoﬀ radius are ad-
justed by comparing the expressed potential form to the
curve calculated with ab-initio by Rousseau et.al.
[18].
Some results we have found are compared with theoret-
ical values in the ref.
[14] and the experimental result

This paper is designed as the follow form, we discuss
the computational process in Sec. 2. The interaction
potentials, which play a crucial role in evaporate cooling
and also determine many properties of the condensate,
are given in Sec. 3. The ultracold scattering proper-
ties(the scattering length, eﬀective range, phase shifts
and the rate coeﬃcients) are computed for collisions of
the Rb-K isotop systems in the singlet and triplet states
at ultra-cold temperatures in Sec. 4 and 5, respectively,

and the convergences of the scattering range and the ef-
fective range are also investigated in detail. We conclude
with brief conclusions.

with n = 6 for spherically symmetric two atoms in their
ground state. The asymptotic parameter κ
c6 is known
quite well for most atomic pairs of interest. Second,
for atoms other than hydrogen and helium the potential
curve is usually quite deep and also the electron-exchange
part of the atomic interaction is repulsive at smaller dis-
tance as for the singlet and triplet terms of alkali- metal
atoms. “Deep” here means that the wave functions of
the atomic pair oscillate many times within the poten-
tial well, even at very low collision energies. The inter-
atomic potential supports a large number of vibration
levels. This latter feature enables one to use the semi-
classical approximation to describe the motion of atoms
within potential well [22].

The mixing alkali-metal atoms have unpaired electron
spin s = 1/2 in the ground state Therefore, the interac-
tion between two diﬀerent alkali atoms in the ground
state results in the formation of a diatomic molecule,
which is described by two terms corresponding to the
total spin sab = sa + sb of the system equals to 1 or 0.
The state with sab = 0 and 1 corresponds to the sin-
glet state and triplet state, respectively. The probability
of the spin exchange is determined by both the depen-
dence of potential curves on the internuclear distance r
and the splitting between singlet and triplet terms. The
exchange interaction is analytically calculated using the
surface integral method by Smirnov and Chibisov [24],

this term is the sum of Van der Waals terms, multiplied
by the relevant cutoﬀ function fc(r) to cancel 1/rn di-
vergence at small distances. The area under r axis of the
interaction potential is very important to specify the ul-
tracold scattering properties, and its value is calculated
from the eq. (6). For any diﬀerent two potential, when it
has same semiclassical phase shifts, the scattering prop-
erties aren’t aﬀected from the change of other parameters
of potential such as the depth of potential [25]. It is the
fact that theoretical potential should actually adopt with
ab- initio one. Therefore, in the singlet state, the some
sensitive Wan der Waals parameters taken from ref. [26]
was multiplied with ﬁt parameter Cc
f . As shown in the
Fig.1, it concludes that the potentials are excellent adapt
due to R square, and we may also name the Cc
f as the cor-
rected constant for Wan der Waals parameters in singlet

and triplet state, and this technique may be useful for
other studies. C6 , C8 and C10 parameters were taken
[26]). The cut-

ing to R square value, there is in excellent agreement be-

IV. THE CONVERGENGE AND
CALCULATION SCATTERING LENGTH AND
EFFECTIVE RANGE OF Rb + K

In this section, the scattering length and the eﬀective
range for the collisions of Rb+K in singlet and triplet
state at ultra-cold temperature have been calculated with
semiclassical method (WKB) [15] and also determined by
solving the Schr¨odinger equation by Numerov method
[16] for the potential given with Eq.(15). Also, we in-
vestigated the convergence of these scattering properties
as a function of energy parameter(K 0) using Quantum
Defect Theory[13].

In third column of Table II, the results of the scatter-
ing length calculated from Eq.(4) with help of the WKB
method are represented for the collision of mixtures com-
posed by rubidium and potassium atoms in singlet and
triplet state described with the potentials in eq.(15) char-
acterized by the term of cutoﬀ radius. Some parameters
are important in the determination of a(a.u.) for WKB
method. We also obtain these parameters, the mean scat-
tering length ¯a and the zero-energy semiclassical phases
ϕ, given in Table III using values of asymptotic parame-
ter γ. Here, the mean scattering length with asymptotic
behavior of the potential in eq.(15) has been calculated
from equation (5).

For calculation numerically scattering length , we ob-
tained s-wave phase shift δ0 using the potentials in

eq.(15), then we do it by solving radial equation using
Numerov algorithm at e = k2/2µ in atomic unit and ﬁnd-
ing δ0 from the asymptotic behavior of the wave function
y(r) = sin(kr + δ0). The phases at small momenta k are
used to extract the scattering length numerically from
a =
0 (dδ0/dk) The scattering lengths obtained
via this method are given in the fourth columns of Table
II. The results obtained in two methods are compared
with values found in the literature .

From the measured thermalization rate, using the
model presented in Ref.[28], the large value for the zero-
energy s-wave scattering length are obtained using con-
ventional double magneto-optical trap (MOT) apparatus
[29, 30]. G. Modugno, G Ferrari and et. al have es-
timated a direct measurement of the scattering lengths
for the 41K-87Rb pair [3]. They also deduced the colli-
sional behavior of other isotope combinations by the help
of mass scaling in the experimental columns of Table II.
[14]. Then, for the 40K-87Rb and41K-87Rb pairs, Simoni
et al. investigated the scattering properties in the pres-
ence of several magnetic ﬁeld [31].

As shown in the Table II, the scattering lengths calcu-
lated for the collisions of rubidium- potassium pairs is in
excellently agreement with the experimental scattering
length when V (r) potential has the excellent adopt with
ab initio curve due to the best R square value.

Even our results shows that the stability of large
condensates requires repulsive interactions (positive a),
whereas for attractive interactions (negative a) it is un-
stable, only a ﬁnite number of atoms can be found in
condensate state in a trap. As shown Tablo II, the scat-
tering lengths found as negative value due to changes in
the V (r), lead to a condensate triplet state where the
number of atoms is limited to a small critical value de-
termined by the magnitude of a.
In contrast, we have
observed the positive scattering lengths that produce sta-
ble condensates. Also, from the scattering length given
as a function of the semiclassical phase shift in the eq.
(4), we say that the minor changes in phase shifts have
strongly aﬀected the scattering amplitude. It concludes
that the ultra-cold scattering depends on the potential
changes given by phase. It must be remarked that our
emphasis for 41K-87Rb pair is weakly dependent on the
number Nbd of bound states supported by ab-initio po-
tential. The numbers of bound states Nbd have been com-
puted in the intervals 108-110 and 32-33 for both singlet
and triplet states, respectively. The numbers of bound
states of the singlet state is consistent with the result
(Nb = 32) obtained ref.[14] In addition, the mass scalling
from one isotope to the others depends more strongly on
ns. The calculations in this paper shows that due to be-
ing boson-fermion, of great interest also is the 40K-87Rb
pair, for which we ﬁnd a negative and probably large in-
terspecies scattering length agreed with other result in
Table II which implies an eﬃcient sympathetic cooling of
the fermionic species down to the degenerate regime [14].

Potassium potentials are presented in Table IV together
the calculation of semiclassical phase shifts. The close
agreement between the calculations of re from Eqs.(8)
and (11) conﬁrms the accuracy of the numerical integra-
tion of the partial-wave equation. The size of the scatter-
ing lengths and eﬀective ranges is closely related to the
position of the last vibration bound states of the energy
curves, as can be anticipation by inspection of Eq.(3)
and number of vibrational levels ns(ϕ/π) which, consis-
tent with Levinson’s theorem, show that as the binding
energy of the highest level tends to zero, the scattering
length tends to

inﬁnity [15].

Analytical calculations of scattering lengths are im-
portant in investigation of convergence of the scattering
length and the eﬀective range. In many approaches used
to solve collision problems in atomic physics, the tree di-
mensional conﬁguration space is divided into two regions
separated by a spherical shell (a core boundary) of radius
ρ. In the inner region (r< ρ) the short-range interaction
between two colliding particles is very complicated and
a scattering equation must be solved independently for
each combination of particles. In contrast, it ρ is cho-
sen suﬃciently large the scattering problems in the outer
region(r> ρ) may be reduced to potential scattering with
the long-range potential accurately approximated by sim-
ple analytical expression. A numerical solution in this
region is usually easily approachable [32]. One of these
methods is Quantum Defect Theory described by Gao
[13].

Quantum defect theory of atomic collisions is pre-
sented by Bo Gao. Based on the exact solutions of the
Schr¨odinger equation for an attractive 1/r6 potential, the
theory provides a systematic interpretation of molecular
bound states and atom-atom scattering properties and
establishes the relationship between them. Bo gao ﬁnds
a deﬁnition for the scattering length and the eﬀective
range and s-wave at zero energy as

Figure 2 show the scattering length and the eﬀective
range curve plotted with the help of eqs. (16) and val-
ues(dotted points) obtained by the mean WKB formulas,
eqs.(5) and (10).

Our graphical representations show that as K 0 goes
inﬁnity, the QDT results converges excellently to values
obtained by WKB method in Fig. 2 . Even, it may
be said that the diﬀerent calculating of the scattering
properties in these two method gives similar results for
any ultracold atom-atom collision (e.g. ref. [33]).

V. PHASE SHIFTS AND CROSS SECTION

Scattering length describes behavior of the atom scat-
tering at low energy, and phase shifts are important pa-
rameter for it. Furthermore, at a low energy, E, of rela-
tive motion the phase-shift is Nbdπ + δ, where Nbd is the
number of bound states. The phase shift can be calcu-
lated by ﬁtting the solution y(r) to sin(kr) and cos(kr),
the asymptotic solutions of Eq. (1). Let Si and Ci de-
note sin(kri) and cos(kri), respectively. Fitting at ri and
rj we ﬁnd, for a small shift [15, 16],

where ri,j = r0 + (i , j)h (h is the step-length ). we show
the numerical phase shifts (module π) in Fig. 3 it is also
known in more tex book that the low energy scattering
is always dominated by the l = 0 partial wave the corre-
sponding phase shift being given by

δ0 =

(18)

which is shown for all Rb+K collisions in Fig. 3. Here,
to plot phase shifts we used the semiclassical scattering
lengths. As momenta goes zero, for l = 0, the s-phase
shifts are very close in the singlet state.
it concludes
that when a gas mixture composed of fermion-boson or
boson-boson is cooled below a critical temperature, the
mixing atoms condensates in the lowest quantum state.
Moreover, if the atoms are bosons, a cloud of atoms oc-
cupies the same quantum state at low temperature. If
the atoms are fermions, cooling gradually brings the gas
closer to being a ‘Fermi sea’ in which exactly one atom
occupies each low-energy state [34].

As shown in ﬁg. 3, their scattering lengths are unstable
against collapse except the 40K-85Rb. For these mixtures
of composed by fermion-boson, the condensates are more
attractive than that of boson-boson as reported in Table
III. In this case, the fermionic cloud cannot shrink below
a certain size determined by the Pauli Exclusion Principle
due to bosonic cloudy [34].

values in the same higher energy region.

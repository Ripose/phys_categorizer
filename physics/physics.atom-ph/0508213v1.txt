INTRODUCTION

II. MOLECULAR ORBITALS

The idea of the LCAO approah to moleular orbital

The moleular strong-(cid:28)eld approximation (MO-SFA)

theory is to identify the moleular orbitals in a basis of

was formulated in the veloity gauge in Ref. [1℄, and more

reently in the length gauge [2℄. The latter work shows

that the veloity gauge MO-SFA with the initial state of

the highest oupied moleular orbital (HOMO) obtained

in a self-onsistent Hartree-Fok (HF) alulations does

not aount for the observed orientation-dependent ion-

ization of N2 [3℄. Only the orresponding length gauge

atomi orbitals. For a homonulear diatomi moleule,

we write a moleular wave funtion Ψ(r) as a superpo-

sition of atomi orbitals whih are entered on eah of

the atomi ores. The nulei are loated at the positions

±R/2 with respet to the enter of the moleule. The

moleular orbitals are the eigenfuntions of the Fok op-

erator, i.e., of the kineti energy operator and the full

MO-SFA [2℄ and the moleular tunneling theory [4℄ give

HF potential. These eigenfuntions an be obtained by a

the orret behavior.

diagonalization of the matrix representation of the Fok

operator in the atomi entered basis, φnlm(r ∓ R/2).

A great simpli(cid:28)ation of the problem is ahieved if the

The orientation dependene of the strong-(cid:28)eld ioniza-

tion of N2 was revisited in Ref. [5℄. There a simple model
is made for the 3σg HOMO in terms of a single linear

basis funtions are symmetrized aording to the mole-

ular point group (D∞h ). Consider, e.g., the atomi 1s
[φ100(r ∓ R/2)℄ orbitals. A hange of basis leads to a

ombination of atomi orbitals (LCAO) using two atomi

p orbitals. Then the MO-SFA is applied in the veloity

new set of basis funtions

gauge to alulate the ionization rate, and it is onluded

that the veloity MO-SFA, with suh an approximation

ψσg 1s(r) = Nσg 1s[φ100(r −

) + φ100(r +

)] (1)

for the HOMO, is apable of prediting the observed min-

imum [3℄ in the rate for perpendiular orientation of the

internulear axis with respet to the linear polarization of

the laser. Based on these (cid:28)ndings it is stated [5℄ that our

earlier veloity gauge alulations [2℄ are inaurate be-

ause of inauraies in our (i) moleular orbital and (ii)

generalized Bessel funtion. Here we refute both these

laims by giving details of our orbitals and generalized

Bessel funtions. Additionally, we show that apart from

having the wrong symmetry, the model used for the 3σg
HOMO of N2 in Ref. [5℄ is too simple and we therefore

believe that the agreement in [5℄ with experiment is a-

idental. To aount for the moleular struture more

LCAOs have to be inluded as, e.g., in HF alulations.

With suh a self-onsistent wave funtion, the veloity

gauge MO-SFA, indeed gives the wrong predition for the

ψσu1s(r) = Nσu1s[φ100(r −

) − φ100(r +

)]. (2)

These new basis funtions belong to de(cid:28)nite symmetry

lassi(cid:28)ations in D∞h , namely Σ+
Σ+

u ('-' ombination). The 2s, 3s, et. orbitals are sym-

g ('+' ombination) and

metrized similarly.

If we extend the basis to ontain

atomi 2p orbitals, the properly symmetrized basis fun-
tions in the Σ bloks are

ψσg 2p(r) = Nσg 2p[φ210(r −

) − φ210(r +

)] (3)

ψσu2p(r) = Nσu2p[φ210(r −

) + φ210(r +

)], (4)

for the 2p0 (2pz ) orbitals, while the `+' and `(cid:21)' ombina-
tion of the 2p±1 are of πu and πg symmetry, respetively,

using Ylm(− ˆp) = (−1)lYlm( ˆp). Equation (5) is the or-

basis funtions themselves to be eigenfuntions, instead

the eigenfuntions are linear ombinations of basis fun-

tions.

III. HARTREE-FOCK CALCULATIONS

In Ref. [2℄ we used the GAMESS [9℄ program for our

quantitative HF alulations of N2 with a (11s6p)/[5s3p]

Cartesian Gaussian basis [10℄. The way we speify

our basis is standard in the quantum hemistry liter-

ature [11℄, but is realled here for ompleteness. The

wave funtion is expanded in 11 s and 6 p orbitals en-

tered on eah atom. These basis orbitals all have dif-

ferent exponentials in the radial parts. The orbitals of

our HF alulation are obtained by a variation of the ex-

pansion oe(cid:30)ients until the energy is minimized. This

proedure is equivalent to an iterative diagonalization of

matrix representations of the Fok operator. With lit-

tle loss of auray but signi(cid:28)ant gain in omputational

speed, the optimization proedure an be simpli(cid:28)ed with

a ontrated basis set. This means that all the expan-

sion oe(cid:30)ients are not varied independently, ontrary

ients. Suh a simpli(cid:28)ation is used in most quantum

hemistry software. Five oe(cid:30)ients orresponding to s
orbitals and three oe(cid:30)ients orresponding to the p or-

bitals are optimized independently. In order to desribe

the asymptoti behavior we augment the basis by adding

an extra di(cid:27)use s and p orbital. In total, the wave fun-
tion is e(cid:27)etively expanded in a basis of six s and four p
orbitals on eah atom denoted by (12s7p)/[6s4p] basis.

In Fig. 1 we show results of our alulations for the

3σg HOMO of N2 [Fig. 1 ()℄ and in its deomposition
of s [Fig. 1 (a)℄ and p [Fig. 1 (b)℄ type basis funtions.

We see that the orbital is omposed of both types of basis

funtions. At (cid:28)rst sight the p ontribution alone seems to

resemble the orbital quite well. However, in the proxim-

ity of the nulei, it is the s ontribution that dominates,
sine the p funtions have nodes on the nulei. It is the s

type ontribution that dominates the momentum spae

wave funtion at low momenta. This fat beomes lear

sis (see text). Left (right) olumn: oordinate (momentum)

a (cid:28)xed relationship is kept between some of the oe(cid:30)-

retly symmetrized version of Eq. (20) of Ref. [5℄. The

in Figs. 1 (d)-(f ), where we show the Fourier transforms

di(cid:27)erene lies in the sine-fator of Eq. (5) ompared with

of the funtions in Figs. 1 (a)-(). It is lear that both the

a osine-fator in Ref. [5℄. A alulation with the p-type

s and p type of basis funtions ontribute signi(cid:28)antly to

basis funtions alone would, beause of this sine-fator,

the momentum wave funtion. Therefore, as disussed

predit suppressed ionization of N2 ompared with the

ompanion Ar atom (cid:21) in ontrast to experimental and

in Se. II, it is insu(cid:30)ient to onsider eah type exlu-

sively: The s and pz basis orbitals are not separately

theoretial (cid:28)ndings [1, 7, 8℄. Thus having pointed out

eigenfuntions of the Fok operator, ontrary, the mix-

the importane of working with properly symmetrized

ture turns out to be essential. At this point the authors

of Ref. [5℄ introdue an oversimpli(cid:28)ation by onsidering

IMPLICATIONS TO THE MOLECULAR

STRONG-FIELD APPROXIMATION

In the MO-SFA one alulates the transition rate from

the HOMO to a ontinuum Volkov state through absorp-

tion of n photons. For a linearly polarized, monohro-
mati (cid:28)eld of frequeny ω and (cid:28)eld strength F0 , the ve-

loity gauge result for the angular di(cid:27)erential ionization

rate in atomi units is [1℄

V. CONCLUSION

4

In onlusion, the veloity gauge MO-SFA when based

on a transition to the ontinuum from an initial HOMO,

determined by a HF alulation using standard quantum

hemistry software, gives the wrong predition for the

orientation-dependent rate. In this approximation only

the length gauge MO-SFA (and the moleular tunneling

theory) [2℄ give the observed minimum [3℄ in the rate for

the perpendiular geometry. This onlusion ontrasts

the (cid:28)ndings in a reent work [5℄. In that work, however,

only a single LCAO of two p-orbitals (of wrong symme-

try) was onsidered for the desription of the HOMO and

no self-onsistent wave funtion was applied. From Fig. 2

we learly see, that an appliation of a too simple wave

funtion, e.g., one with only p basis funtions, leads to

a predition aidentally in qualitative agreement with

experiment [3℄. If one nevertheless would be enouraged

by this agreement to believe that the single LCAO of p

orbitals desribes the physis well, one should note that

suh a wave funtion due to the presene of the sine-

fator in (5) would predit suppressed ionization in N2

ompared with Ar whih is in ontrast with experiments

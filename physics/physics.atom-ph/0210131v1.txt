We examine collective magnetoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), focusing on rapid
adiabatic passage from atoms to molecules induced by a sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld across a wide
>
∼ 10 G) Feshbach resonance in 85Rb. This problem raises an interest because strong magnetoas-
(
sociation is expected to favor the creation of molecular-dissociated atom pairs over the formation
of molecular BEC [Javanainen and Mackie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)]. Nevertheless, the
conversion to atom pairs is found to depend on the direction of the sweep, so that a system initially
above threshold (open dissociation channel) may in fact give near-complete conversion to molecules.

Photoassociation occurs when a laser is on resonance
with a transition from the collisional state of an atom
pair to a bound state of a molecule [1]. The anal-
ogous process of magnetoassociation, which involves a
Zeeman-shifted molecular level on Feshbach resonance
with a colliding atom pair [2], has an identical formalism,
and intuition developed in one case is applicable to the
other. Speciﬁcally, the probability of photoassociation
in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) was found to ap-
proach unity [3], which opened the door to the possibility
of using coherent magnetoassociation [4] or photoassoci-
ation [5,6] of already-Bose-condensed atoms to create a
molecular BEC.

Early theory of coherent association was implicitly
based on few-mode models that neglect transitions to
noncondensate modes [4,5,6]. Such “rogue” [7,8], or un-
wanted [9,10], transitions to noncondensate modes occur
because the dissociation of a zero-momentum (k = 0)
BEC molecule need not take the atoms back to the zero-
momentum atomic condensate, but may just as well end
k). Since
up with two atoms with opposite momenta (
the coherent condensate coupling scales like the square
root of the laser intensity (Feshbach-resonance width)
and the noncondensate coupling scales like the intensity,
rogue dissociation is expected to play a dominant role in
strongly coupled atom-molecule systems [7,8].

±

Pioneering experiments [11] with photoassociation of
87Rb BEC were found to be just on the verge [7] of coher-
ent atom-molecule conversion. Next-generation Na [12]
and 7Li [13] experiments were aimed at the strongly inter-
acting regime, and probed the potential photoassociation
rate limit. Meanwhile, experiments on magnetoassocia-
tion in 85Rb have led to dramatic losses of BEC atoms
for a sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld across resonance [14],
a collapsing condensate with bursts of atoms emanating
from a remnant condensate [15], a counterintuitive de-
crease in condensate losses for an increasing interaction
time [16], and collective burst-remnant oscillations [17].

Rogue dissociation is the key to an overall understand-
ing of these experimental results. First, although the
experiments remain inconclusive on this score [12,13],
a rate limit is to be expected when the conversion to
rogue-dissociated atom pairs dominates over the forma-
tion of molecular condensate [8,9]. Similarly, the losses
for across-resonance sweeps [14], and the counterintu-
itive losses [16], can be viewed as rapid adiabatic passage
from BEC to rogue-dissociated atoms pairs [18]. The
remnant-burst oscillations [17] are identiﬁed as Ramsey
fringes in the evolution between an atomic condensate
and a molecular condensate dressed by noncondensate
atom pairs [18,19,20].

There remains the matter of the formation of a molec-
ular condensate. In magnetoassociation experiments, the
sum of the remnant and burst atoms does not entirely ac-
count for the initial condensate, and the missing atoms
are roughly consistent with calculations [18,19,20] of the
number of molecules formed, thus indirectly [21] conﬁrm-
ing the realization of molecular BEC. Either way, the
(measured) calculated fraction of (atom loss) molecular
condensate is small ( <

∼ 10%).

The question is whether an improvement of the 85Rb2
conversion eﬃciency is possible. Given the exisiting re-
sults [5,7,8,9,10,13,15,16,17,18,22],
the immediate an-
swer is no. The 155 G magnetoassociation resonance in
85Rb is exceptionally strong, and rogue dissociation is ap-
parently prominent.
Indeed, the qualitative agreement
between experiment [14] and theory [18] indicates that
the obvious solution, a
1 ms sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld
across resonance, merely causes rapid adiabatic passage
from the initial atomic condensate to rogue-dissociated
atoms, with very little molecular BEC formed. The
present Letter reports our startling observation that, sim-
ply by reverting the direction of the sweep of the mag-
netic ﬁeld from the experiments of Ref. [14], rapid adia-
batic passage [5,7,23] may nonetheless eﬃciently convert
from an atomic to a molecular condensate.

toassociation and Feshbach resonance [8,18] in an at-
tempt to extract as much quantitative accuracy out of
it as possible. The model includes an atomic conden-
sate [described by the complex amplitude α], a molecu-

As always, ¯hδ0 represents the “bare” energy of the bound
molecular state referenced to the dissociation threshold,

The energy proﬁle for atom-molecule coupling f (ǫ)
has proven to be the most signiﬁcant of these addi-
tions. We use simple Fourier transform methods [18] to
study the coupling-induced renormalization of the detun-
ing, δ0
δ, and the binding energy EB of the dressed
molecules consisting of a coherent superposition of the
bare molecules [β] and correlated atom pairs [C(ǫ)]. The
experiments of Donley et at. [17] and the close-coupling
calculations of Kokkelmans and Holland [19] also bear
on the dependence of the binding energy on the detun-
ing. The physical detuning varies with the magnetic
ﬁeld applied on the sample as ¯hδ = (B0
B)∆µ, where
B0 = 154.9 G is the position of a particular Feshbach res-
onance in 85Rb, and ∆µ = 2.23 µB [19] is the diﬀerence
in the magnetic moments of the atomic and molecular
states participating in this resonance. The dressed bind-
ing energy is reported as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld.
In order to ﬁt the latest [19] and previous [17] close-
coupled calculations, we have tried a number of dif-
ferent coupling functions f (ǫ), both ad-hoc and forms
originating from square-well and Lennard-Jones models.
So far the best match was found with the ad-hoc pro-

ǫ) A/(A + ǫ). We choose a cutoﬀ
ǫM = 20 (µs)−1 high enough that it has little eﬀect on
the results, and ﬁx the remaining parameters ξ and A
so that the desired binding energy is obtained at two
widely spaced magnetic ﬁelds. The parameter values
used in the present paper are ξ = 19.32 (µs)−1/4 and
A = 0.9537 (µs)−1. A comparison of our calculated bind-
ing energies with the latest theory [19] shows a maximum
mismatch of about 9% around 160 G, which is under-
standable as we have chosen the parameters A and ξ to
match the close-coupling calculations at the end points
of the magnetic-ﬁeld range considered (

157-162 G).

Another signiﬁcant aspect in quantitative work is that
we now average the results of our norm-preserving algo-
rithm [8,18] over the density proﬁle of trapped atoms.
The average is the same for all three-dimensional Gaus-
sian distributions with the same peak density ρ0.

In Ref. [19], an explicit sequence of two magnetic ﬁeld
pulses is speciﬁed with the implication that it was used to
simulate a Ramsey-fringe experiment [17]. The fraction
of condensate atoms, noncondensate atoms, and the sum
of these two quantities at the end of the pulse sequence
are given as a function of the time that the magnetic
ﬁeld is held at a constant value between the pulses. How-
ever, the results in Ref. [19] are not consistent with the
magnetic ﬁeld during the holding period displayed in the
pulse sequence, 160 G, and we replace this by the value
used in the experiment being simulated, 159.84 G. With
this proviso, we have carried out the same calculations
using the present methods. In Fig. 1 we have copied the
results from Ref. [19], and overlaid our calculations as
plus signs. Though the comparison may look alarming,
the apparent discrepancy originates from an about 10%
diﬀerence in the frequency of the Ramsey fringes. This is
exactly as expected on the basis of the binding energy dif-
ference discussed above. Given that the two approaches
are seemingly quite diﬀerent, we deem the match of the
Ramsey fringes per se as excellent.

Unfortunately, when we turn to quantitative compar-
isons with experimental results, we still [18] receive a
mixed message. For instance, let us revisit the experi-
ment of Ref. [14]. The magnetic ﬁeld is swept from 162 G
to 132 G, so that the decay channel of molecules to atom
pairs is initially closed and opens when the Feshbach res-
onance is crossed. In Fig. 2 we have in eﬀect lifted from
Ref. [14] their Fig. 2 showing the fraction of atoms re-
maining in the atomic condensate after the magnetic ﬁeld
sweep as a function of the inverse of the sweep rate, and
overlaid our results as crosses. The agreement would be
excellent, were it not for the fact that we used the peak
1013 cm−3 whereas the ex-
condensate density ρ0 = 1.1
periment reports ρ0 = 1.0

1012 cm−3.

Let us continue just the same to use the peak den-
1013 cm−3, and ask what happens if
sity ρ0 = 1.1
the magnetic ﬁeld is swept the opposite direction, e.g.,
142
172 G. At ﬁrst blush, not much; overlaying the
lost-atom fraction on Fig. 2 would give agreement with
the crosses for all but the fastest-sweep data point.

However, a profound diﬀerence emerges when the
progress of sweeps is followed in time. In Fig. 3 we show
the fractions of atomic and molecular condensate, and
noncondensate atoms, as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Pane (a) is for a 172
142 G sweep, pane (b) for the op-
posite sweep, and both inverse sweep rates are 20 µs/G.
In a Cornish-type [14] sweep, condensate atoms are un-
ceremoniously converted to rogue atoms, and the molec-
ular fraction remains negligible [18]. An opposite sweep
begins the same; but, as the system moves well past the
resonance, nearly all noncondensate atom pairs are con-
verted into molecules. This conclusion is independent of
sweep rate, and survives the density averaging. For the
slowest sweep rate, 85% of the atoms would have been
converted to molecules and 1% to noncondensate atoms.
We have come full circle. In our earliest publication on
coherent photoassociation (and, by formal equivalence,
on magnetoassociation) of a BEC, we predicted rapid
adiabatic passage from an atomic to a molecular conden-
sate induced by a sweep of the detuning δ across the res-
onance [5]. Those arguments were based on a two-mode
model, i.e., atomic and molecular condensates only. In
the interim it has become evident [7,8] that rogue dissoci-
ation to noncondensate atoms is a dominant factor in the
dynamics whenever Ω >
∼ ωρ, a condition met by two or-
ders of magnitude in the JILA experiments [14,15,16,17].
Hence, rapid adiabatic passage was not a leading possi-
bility for creating a 85Rb2 molecular condensate. Now it
has made a comeback with a vengeance.

Whereas detuning-sweep conversion in a two-mode
model is independent of sweep direction, strong rogue dis-
sociation means transfer to molecules only happens for a
sweep in which the molecular dissociation channel closes
after the resonance. Past rate theory reasonably surmises
that, after the dissociation channel closes, the molecules
should not dissociate anymore [5]; but, the present result
is about coherent evolution, and at least directly is not
about rates or a closing dissociation channel.

To appreciate the double-adiabatic process that takes
place here, consider again the coupled linear system con-
sisting of the molecules and the noncondensate atoms.
There is only one negative-energy eigenstate, and it only
exists for negative detunings: a molecule dressed by non-
condensate atom pairs. Whatever the eigenstates are,
in the present model the atomic condensate only cou-
ples to the bare-molecule component of the eigenstates.
Moreover, in the case when the dissociation channel is
open, the bare-molecule component is concentrated in
the eigenstates around the energies that correspond to a
resonance between a molecule and the atom pairs.

Our hypothesis for the events during a sweep of the
detuning from an initially-open to a ﬁnally-closed dis-
sociation channel is as follows. The molecule may be
strongly mixed with the atom pairs; but, the zero-energy
atomic condensate holds the initial probability, and is
oﬀ resonance from the dressed eigenstates with any sub-
stantial molecular component. As the detuning is swept,
eventually eigenstates with a signiﬁcant molecular ampli-

tude are suﬃciently close to resonance with the atomic
condensate for transitions to take place. Transitions
go mainly to the dressed molecule, the negative-energy
eigenstate of the system. Continuing the sweep then gives
adiabatic conversion from dressed to bare molecules.

→

The asymmetry is easy to understand on the same
basis. When the detuning is swept in such a direction
(say, 162
132 G) that a dissociation channel opens
for molecules after the resonance, the initial events are
roughly similar as in a sweep going the other way. How-
ever, after the resonance is crossed, the bare molecules
will not separate as an eigenstate of their own but remain
diluted by the atom pairs.

While we ﬁnd excellent quantitative agreement with
the theoretical calculations of Ref. [19], we are experi-
encing persistent problems when trying to match experi-
ments [14,16]. Missing of course is both quenching of the
molecules and collisional decoherence of atom pairs. No
quantitative data on such processes are available at this
time, but we have been experimenting by adding relax-
ation mechanisms into our calculations. So far, none of
these attempts has led to a universal model that could
quantitatively reproduce all experimental data.

Nevertheless, we propose making a 85Rb2 conden-
sate simply by asymmetric adaptation of the single-
pulse experiments of Claussen et al. [16]:

1 G/µs) to 142 G, losing a

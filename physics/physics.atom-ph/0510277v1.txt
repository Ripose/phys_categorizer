The complete O(α2) correction to the long range interaction between neutral closed shell atoms

is obtained, the relation to the asymptotic expansion of the known short range interaction at the

atomic scale is presented and a general interaction potential which is valid in the whole range of

the inter atomic distances is constructed.

The retarded long-range interaction between neutral systems was ﬁrst considered by

Casimir and Polder in their pioneering work in [1]. At large distances atoms interact pre-
dominantly by the two-photon exchange with the nonrelativistic dipole interaction −e ~r · ~E.

There were various extensions of their result. First of all, Feinberg and Sucher in [2] (see also

a longer review in [3]) expressed the two-photon exchange interaction (dispersion forces) in

terms of the well-deﬁned physical quantities, the invariant amplitudes which describe the

elastic scattering of a photon by an atom. These amplitudes are often called dynamic po-

larizabilities.

In this way the authors obtained a formally exact result, as all relativistic

corrections are included in the dynamic polarizabilities. In the nonrelativistic limit their

result reduces to that of Casimir and Polder. In the limit of large distances their result is

expressible in terms of a static electric and magnetic polarizabilities only, similarly to the

nonrelativistic Casimir-Polder interaction. The calculation of relativistic corrections to the

dynamic polarizability is not a simple problem. Therefore in later works a diﬀerent approach

to dispersion forces was developed which based on a reformulation of nonrelativistic quan-

tum electrodynamics. Apart from the rederivation of the Casimir-Polder result, there were

derived closed formulae for higher multipole interactions such as electric quadrupole [4, 5, 6]

and electric octupole [7] for isotropic systems, magnetic dipole and diamagnetic couplings for

chiral molecules [5]. In this work, using a diﬀerent reformulation of nonrelativistic quantum

electrodynamics [8], we present a systematic derivation of all O(α2) contributions to the

Casimir-Polder potential of closed shell atoms, including corrections which have not been

considered so far. The obtained result is expressible in terms of various corrections to the

nonrelativistic dynamic polarizability, in agreement with the general result of Feinberg and

Sucher in [2]. Moreover, we present the relation of relativistic corrections to the Casimir-

Polder interaction to the short range nonrelativistic expansion and construct an interaction

potential which is valid in the whole range of inter-atomic distances.

Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the α expansion of the interaction potential in the clamped nuclei

approximation. We use natural units, where c = ¯h = ǫ0 = 1 and denote by m the electron

mass. The total energy of a system consisting of two neutral atoms is a function of the ﬁne

structure constant α and the distance R between these atoms

E = E(α, m R) .

(1)

The nonrelativistic expansion in α depends on the magnitude of R. According to quantum

2

electrodynamics, if R is of the order of an atomic size R ∼ 1/(m α), then this expansion at

constant m α R takes the form

E(α, m R) = E(2)(m α R) + E(4)(m α R) + E(5)(m α R) + O(α6) ,

(2)

where E(2) is the nonrelativistic energy of order m α2 of a systems of two atoms including

Coulomb interactions between all electrons, E(4) is the leading relativistic correction of order

m α4, which is given by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian δH [9]. We include below only the terms

which do not vanish for closed shell atoms

E(4) = hδHi ,

where the sum goes over all electrons of both atoms. E(5) is the QED correction of order

is dominating at large atomic distances,

On the other hand, if R is of the order of atomic transition wavelength, namely R ∼

1/(m α2) then the α expansion at constant m α2 R takes a completely diﬀerent form

E(α, m R) = Efree(α) + ECP (m α2R) + δ(2)ECP (m α2R) + . . .

(6)

where Efree is the energy of separate atoms, ECP is a Casimir-Polder potential [1] and δ(2)ECP
is the leading α2 relativistic correction, which is the subject of this work. The form of this

expansion results from the long wavelength formulation of quantum electrodynamics, see

Ref.

[8]. This relativistic correction to the interaction energy at large atomic distances is

obtained from the eﬀective interaction HI of an atom with the slowly varying electromagnetic

present implicitly in all the formulas below. The leading Casimir-Polder interaction comes
from the two-photon exchange with the interaction −e ~ra · ~E. Using the temporal gauge for

We have not found in the literature the complete formula for the leading relativistic correc-

tion to the electric dipole polarizability of the closed shell atoms as that in the Eq. (23).

Let us now consider the large and small R limit of the interaction energy. At large R,

the δ(0)

0 ECP and δ(2)

4 ECP contribute to the 1/R7 coeﬃcient, but it is only a small correction
on the top of ECP . Much more interesting is a small R expansion of ECP and δ(2)ECP

and its relation to the large R expansion of energy as a function of α and m α R. This

relation has been ﬁrst considered by Meath and Hirschfelder in [15]. The large R expansion

of E(i)(m α R) from Eq. (2) reads

E(2) = E(2)

In summary, the purpose of this work was the derivation of a complete α2 correction to

the Casimir-Polder potential in order to obtain a more accurate description of inter-atomic

interactions in the region where the electron wave functions from diﬀerent atoms do not

overlap. The obtained result can be used for the precise calculation of the scattering length

and highly excited vibrational levels of light molecules. Particularly interesting is the helium

dimer which existence has been conﬁrmed as recently as in 1994 [16]. Its dissociation energy

has an extremely small value of 1 mK, while the mean internuclear distance is as large as 50
˚A. Its existence can be associated to the long range attraction between the helium monomers.

Since the minor perturbations of the interaction potential result in signiﬁcant changes in the

description of the nuclear motion, the potential in the large range of inter-atomic distances

with an accuracy of the order of 1 mK is needed, which is the magnitude of relativistic and

QED eﬀects [17].

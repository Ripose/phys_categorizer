We propose a scheme to create high-contrast, periodic atom density distributions having period
λ/2n using the Talbot eﬀect, where λ is the wave length of the optical ﬁelds that scatter the atoms
and n is a positive integer. This ﬁltered Talbot lens is comprised of two standing-wave optical ﬁelds.
An atomic beam propagates perpendicular to the ﬁelds. The ﬁrst ﬁeld, which is far-detuned from
the atomic transition frequency, acts as an array of lenses that focuses the atoms. The second ﬁeld,
positioned at the atom optical focus of the ﬁrst, is resonant with the atomic transition frequency
and acts as an amplitude mask, leaving unperturbed only those atoms that pass through its nodes.
At distances following the interaction with the second ﬁeld that are equal to an integral fraction of
the Talbot length, atomic density gratings having period λ/2n are formed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the past several years, considerable progress has
been made in the manipulation of atoms by optical ﬁelds.
One important application of this new technology is the
focusing and deposition of atoms on substrates [1,2]. Us-
ing standing wave optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ, one
has been able to write a periodic array of lines or dots
having period λ/2. The atomic ”lines” or ”dots” them-
selves have widths w that are very small compared with
λ/2; widths (half width at half maximum) as small as 6.5
nm have been achieved [3]. With such a resolution, one
can envision writing structures having periods as small
as λ/2n, where n, the atomic grating order, can be as
large as

nmax ∼

λ/4w

25.

(1)

Although periods as small as λ/2nmax are consistent with
the resolution achieved to date, it is not obvious how
one can use optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ to pro-
duce such periodic structures. For example, focusing by
standing wave ﬁelds results in periods equal to λ/2, or
possibly λ/4 if cross-polarized counterpropagating waves
are used [4]. A similar periodicity can be expected us-
ing optical masks [5], in which only those atoms passing
through the nodes of a standing wave ﬁeld are registered
on a substrate.

There have been a number of proposals for producing
sub-λ or higher-order atomic density gratings, which nec-
essarily involve nonlinear interactions of the atoms with
the ﬁelds. Atom interference [6] allows one to exploit
photon echo techniques to isolate higher order gratings
at speciﬁc focal planes following the interaction of an
atomic beam with two or more standing wave ﬁelds [7,8].

High-order Bragg scattering of an atomic beam by stand-
ing wave ﬁelds has produced structures with periods as
small as λ/6 [9]. Counterpropagating waves, detuned
from one another by an appropriate ratio, can be used to
create arbitrarily high order gratings with good contrast
[10]. It is even possible to achieve higher order gratings
using the standard focusing or optical mask geometries,
if one is able to exploit the Talbot or self-imaging eﬀect
[11]

In atom optics the Talbot eﬀect was observed us-
ing microfabricated structures to scatter atoms [12].
When atoms propagating along the z axis pass through
a microfabricated structure having period λ/2 in the
direction, the atomic spatial distribution becomes a
x
−
periodic function of z having period equal to the Talbot
length LT = λ2/2λdB, where λdB = h/M u is the atomic
de Broglie wavelength, and M and u are atomic mass and
speed, respectively. In other words, self images of the mi-
crofabricated grating are produced at integral multiples
of the Talbot length. Moreover, for a microfabricated
structure with duty cycle f (ratio of opening to period),
periodic structures having order as high as λ/2f can be
produced at integral fractions of the Talbot length [13].
Using this technique, 7th order gratings have been ob-
served [14] using a metastable He beam passing through
a microfabricated structure having period λ/2 = 6.55 µ
and duty cycle f = 0.1.

Instead of microfabricated structures, one can use an
optical mask to act as an amplitude grating for a beam
of metastable atoms.
In a typical experiment [5], a
metastable atomic beam is sent through a standing wave
ﬁeld that is resonant with a transition originating on the
metastable level (see Fig. 1). If the upper level is excited
by the ﬁeld, it decays to the ground state. By using a

1

substrate that is sensitive only to metastable atoms, one
exposes the substrate only to those atoms which pass
through the nodes of the ﬁeld. Thus, for metastable
atoms the strong standing wave ﬁeld acts as a microfabri-
cated structure with a small duty cycle. Experimentally,
an atomic grating having period of order 200 nm (λ/4)
was created using this eﬀect when a metastable Ar beam
was passed through an optical mask [15]. An alternative,
non-lithographic detection scheme that probes the lower
level population may also be possible [16].

FIG. 1. Talbot eﬀect and fractional self-images using an
optical mask. When a beam of metastable atoms having
the level scheme shown in (a) passes through the resonant
standing wave ﬁeld shown in (b), only atoms moving within
the narrow vicinity of the ﬁeld nodes remain in level 1, pro-
ducing a metastable atomic density grating (not shown in
the ﬁgure) having period λ/2 immediately following the in-
teraction. Further free evolution of the atomic wave func-
tion results in a ﬁrst-order self-image at the Talbot distance
z = LT , a λ/4 spatial shift of this density at the dis-
tance z = LT /2, a second-order self-image at the distance
z = LT /4, and higher-order images at the fractional Talbot
distances z = LT /m, for integer m.

Optical masks give a high fringe contrast, but low
deposition rate, since most of the atoms pass through
high ﬁeld regions and are not recorded on the substrate.
To overcome this problem without an optical mask, one
might try to combine the Talbot eﬀect with the focusing
of atoms by a far-detuned standing wave ﬁeld. The ﬁeld,
which is also aligned along the x axis, acts as a series of
lenses. The centers of the lenses are located at the min-
ima of the optical potential produced by the ﬁeld, and
the focal length of each lens is denoted by zf . If these
focused atoms were equivalent to atoms passing through
an amplitude transmission grating at the focal plane, one
would expect that, as a result of the Talbot eﬀect, high-

2

contrast, high-order images of the periodic focal pattern
would be formed at distances

zm = zf + LT /m.

(2)

from the ﬁeld. Janicke and Wilkens [17] carried out nu-
merical calculations to obtain some evidence for this ef-
fect. A more detailed analysis [18], however, reveals that
the background density between the focused atoms seri-
ously degrades the fractional Talbot eﬀect.

It might seem strange that the relatively small back-
ground density between the focal spots can lead to a
serious degradation of the fractional Talbot signal. To
understand the origin of this eﬀect, it is helpful to return
to the theory of the fractional Talbot eﬀect [13].
If a
wave function ψ (x, zf ) is prepared at z = zf having pe-
riod d, then at a fractional Talbot distance LT /m from
this plane, this wave function is mapped into a set of n
copies shifted from one another along x by a distance
d/n (with n = m or m/2) . The total wave function is a
linear superposition of these copies with coeﬃcients hav-
ing the same absolute value but diﬀerent phases. After
squaring the wave function to obtain the atomic density,
one ﬁnds that the diﬀerent phases are responsible for the
degradation of the fractional Talbot images. In the case
of focusing by an oﬀ-resonace ﬁeld, one ﬁnds that the tail
of the wave function of one of the copies interferes with
the peak of the wave function of another copy. This is
a strong eﬀect. A tail to peak ratio of 0.1 in the wave
function at z = zf implies a ratio of background to peak
density of 0.01 at z = zf . However, at a fractional Tal-
bot distance from z = zf , interference between the tail
and peak of the wave function can result in changes to
the atomic density that can deviate by as much as 20%
from the density that would have been produced in the
absence of any background density.

One way to avoid such interference eﬀects is to min-
imize or eliminate the background density.
If a plane
matter wave is incident on a microfabricated grating
or periodic amplitude mask having duty cycle f, one
period of the wave function immediately following the
mask consists of a peak having width df and a vanish-
f )d. At a
ing background density having width (1
fractional Talbot distance LT /m from this plane, there
will be no spatial overlap (and no interference) of the
n copies (n = m or m/2) of the wave function, provided
that n < 1/f . If this condition is satisﬁed, a ”perfect”
fractional Talbot eﬀect is produced.

−

To improve the quality of the fractional Talbot images,
one can place a mask in the path of the atoms just before
they interact with the focusing ﬁeld. The mask reduces
the aperture of each ”lens” in the standing wave focus-
ing ﬁeld, resulting in reduced spherical aberration and a
reduction in backgrond density [19]; however, just as in
the case of optical masks, a signiﬁcant decrease in beam
ﬂux results. In this paper, we combine oﬀ-resonant fo-
cusing with an optical mask placed at the focal plane of
the oﬀ-resonant ﬁeld. The mask acts as a spatial ﬁlter for
the focused atoms that removes most of the background

atoms between the focal spots. Thus, the atomic beam
ﬂux is maintained while the degradation of the fractional
Talbot eﬀect is avoided. As such, one can expect this
ﬁltered Talbot lens (FTL) to produce high density im-
ages of reduced periodicity at integral fractions of the
Talbot distance from the focal plane. It is important to
note that the wave fronts need not be planar at the mask
openings. As long as the waves incident on the focus-
ing ﬁeld are nearly planar, the matter waves converging
at the focal plane are coherent. This coherent matter
wave impinging on the mask produces a very diﬀerent
diﬀracion pattern than that of an incoherent superposi-
tion of plane waves incident from diﬀerent directions. An
incoherent superposition of waves would not produce a
fractional Talbot image on averaging over all directions of
the incident wave, whereas a coherent incident beam can
produce a ”perfect” fractional Talbot eﬀect if the duty
cycle of the mask is suﬃciently small.

We proceed below to examine this possibility in more

detail.

A beam of atoms having the level structure shown in
Fig. 1 interacts with two standing wave optical ﬁelds
that drive the 1
2 transition. The ﬁrst ﬁeld, located
at z = 0, is far-detuned from the atomic resonance and
focuses the atoms at the plane z = zf . The second ﬁeld,
shown in Fig. 1 and located at z = zf , is resonant or
nearly resonant with the atoms. The atoms move with
velocity u = uˆz, and the 1

Expressions (11), (20), and (21) are convenient for nu-

tional Talbot times

Both of these features are more readily apparent if we
follow alternative approaches. First, instead of Eq. (11),

the tails of the unavoidable background wave function
between the peaks.

cused atoms, the optical mask slit width or opening size

For the FTL scheme to produce high-quality, high-
contrast fractional self-images, it is suﬃcient that three
conditions are met. First, the focused atoms at tf must
have a large density (ρ (x, tf )
1) at the positions
x = 2πs/q. For θ
1, the peak density can be estimated
to grow as 3.83θ1/2 according to an analysis of Eq. (23b)
0.118λθ−3/4 [18]
[18]. Second, the focal spot size 2w
should be less than λ/2m for case (a) and less than λ/m
for cases (b) and (c). Thus, the eﬀective duty cycle of
the focused atom density over the λ/2 period is

In Fig. 2 we compare the atomic spatial distributions
at the fractional Talbot lengths when the focusing and
masking ﬁelds each act alone and when they are com-
bined as detailed above. This plot was obtained numer-
ically using Eqs. (11) and (25) in (26) for θ = 10 and
β = 40. [Alternatively, one can evaluate the density us-
ing Eq. (21). This equation must be used for distances

tical mask (pulse 2) is larger than the spot size of the
focused atomic beam but still suﬃciently narrow to ﬁlter

but we use the more precise value tf ≈
tained numerically in Ref. [18]. The FTL produces high-
contrast, higher order atomic gratings at the fractional
Talbot times. The mask alone also produces such peri-
odic structures but with severely reduced contrasts and
larger spot sizes. The focusing ﬁeld acting alone produces
narrow structures at the fractional Talbot distances, but
the density’s overall periodicity remains equal to λ/2 as
opposed to forming a self-image of reduced periodicity.

In Fig. 3 we plot the atom density proﬁles at fractional
Talbot distances with γτ = 4 and θ = 10. The plot has
been obtained by combining Eqs. (11), (16), (17), and
(25) [22]. We have found that the amplitudes of the dif-
ferent peaks between x = 0 and x = λ/2 in the fractional
. The
Talbot eﬀect oscillate slightly as a function of
origin of these Rabi-like oscillations is an interference of
the m terms in Eq. (25a), each of which has a diﬀerent
phase that depends on the Rabi frequency χ2. For each m

we have chosen a value of the parameter
τ that min-
imizes these oscillations to provide as pure a fractional
self-image as possible.

FIG. 3. The same type of density plots as those shown in
Fig. 2, but for a moderate value of the upper state decay rate
(γτ = 4) and a large value of the optical mask Rabi frequency
|χ2/γ| > 1 The parameter |χ2τ | is chosen for each plot by
requiring that the ratio of the maximum and minimum am-
plitudes of the peaks in the fractional density pattern are as
close as possible to unity. In each case this choice produces
the best nth-order fractional self-image with the ﬁltered Tal-
bot lens. For all plots, the focusing ﬁeld area θ is equal to
10.

Chromatic aberration and atomic beam angular diver-
gence degrade the focusing and the Talbot eﬀect. Chro-
matic aberration arises as a result of a distribution of
longitudinal velocities in the atomic beam. Recently, this
eﬀect was considered in detail for thin lens atom focus-
ing [18]. It was shown that, owing to the ﬁnite depth of
focus, the focusing is not seriously degraded for θ
10
until the spread in velocities divided by the average ve-
locity, ∆v/u, exceeds 0.1. For larger values of ∆v/u, our
numerical results indicate that high-order atomic grat-
ings are still produced, but a background density arises
whose amplitude starts to be comparable with the peaks
of the fractional Talbot spots.

Angular divergence in the beam provides a more se-
vere restriction. If atoms move at an angle φ relative to
the z axis, the atomic distribution will be displaced by
φLT /m when the beam travels a distance equal
δx
to LT /m. This displacement has to be smaller than the
width of the peak in the focused atomic distribution if
we want to maintain the beam ﬂux and produce high-
contrast, mth-order patterns. From Eq. (23b) one can
deduce [18] that the half-width of the distribution is ap-
proximately equal to 0.06λθ−3/4. From this expression
one ﬁnds that the angular divergence φ must be less than

6

λ mθ−3/4 for the FTL to operate eﬀectively. This
0.12 λdB
requirement is similar to the one necessary for the Tal-
bot eﬀect produced by microfabricated structures. We
expect that the application of modern sub-recoil laser
cooling techniques or the use of Bose condensates [23]
will allow one to achieve these degrees of longitudinal
and transverse cooling.

In summary, we have presented a proposal for creating
nanostructures using both a focusing ﬁeld and a mask-
ing ﬁeld. The focusing ﬁeld creates high density focal
spots that are transmitted by the masking ﬁeld. At the
focal plane, the wave fronts entering the optical mask
are coherent and fairly ﬂat. Consequently, the situation
is similar to a collimated beam that strikes the masking
ﬁeld. Owing to the Talbot eﬀect, the spots are refocused
with reduced periods following the masking ﬁeld at dis-
tances that are integral fractions of the Talbot length.
Using this technique, it should be possible to produce
high contrast structures having periods as small as λ/20.

[22] Even for a large Rabi frequency |χ2| , one can still apply
the Fourier method to derive an analog of Eq. (21) for
the atom density at an arbitrary time t − tf . To do this,
instead of using an addition theorem for Bessel functions,
one can use identity (121) of Ref. [13], valid for any pe-
riodic transmission function. This expression is not pre-
sented here.

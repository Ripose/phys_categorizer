Abstract. We have theoretically investigated 3D focusing of a launched cloud
of cold atoms using a pair of magnetic lens pulses (the alternate-gradient method).
Individual lenses focus radially and defocus axially or vice-versa. We discuss the
performance of the two possible pulse sequences and ﬁnd they are ideal for loading
both ‘pancake’ and ‘sausage’ shaped magnetic/optical microtraps. We show that
focusing aberrations are considerably smaller for double-impulse magnetic lenses
compared to single-impulse magnetic lenses.

1. Introduction

The ﬁeld of atom optics [1] has undergone a dramatic expansion in the last two decades,
largely as a consequence of the development of laser-cooling techniques [2], and the
routine production of atoms at microKelvin temperatures [3]. Paramagnetic cold
atoms can be manipulated with the Stern-Gerlach force [4]. To date, the Stern-Gerlach
force has been used to realise a variety of atomic mirrors for both cold [5] and Bose
condensed atoms [6]. This paper, however, concentrates on the formation of magnetic
lenses for cold atoms. In comparison to a ballistically expanding unfocused cloud, a
magnetically focused cloud can lead to density increases (or conversely temperature
decreases) of many orders of magnitude. Applications include: atom lithography [7];
transferring cold atoms from a Magneto Optical Trap (MOT) to a remote vacuum
chamber of lower background pressure [8]; cold low-density atomic sources for fountain
clocks [9].

The ﬁrst demonstration of 3D focusing with pulsed magnetic lenses was conducted
by Cornell et al. [10]. The group of Gorceix have made experimental and theoretical
studies of cold atom imaging by means of pulsed magnetic ﬁelds [11, 12]. However,
neither work addressed the optimum strategy for achieving a compact focused cloud,
nor the limiting features for the quality of their atom-optical elements.

Recently we provided a theoretical analysis of 3D focusing of weak-ﬁeld-seeking
cold atoms using a single magnetic pulse [13]. Lens designs for 1D and 3D were
presented that minimise aberrations due to the lens potential’s departure from the

perfect parabolic case. Single-impulse 3D focusing has been experimentally achieved at
Durham University, the results of which can be seen in a forthcoming publication [14].
The scope of this paper is to investigate theoretically and numerically the limiting
factors to the quality and size of the ﬁnal image obtained in double-impulse magnetic
focusing experiments; to identify the sources of aberration; and to discuss schemes
for minimising their eﬀect. We will show that both single- and double-impulse lenses
yield a magnetically focused cloud with a bimodal distribution consisting of a highly
diﬀuse outer cloud, as well as a core cloud which can be orders of magnitude denser
than the initial atomic sample. This core cloud is therefore ideal for remotely loading
tight traps with relatively small depth, e.g. miniature magnetic guides [15], atom
chips [4, 16] and optical dipole traps [17].

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 outlines the theory
of how to achieve the desired magnetic ﬁelds; Section 3 contains an analysis of
magnetic imaging and minimising the ﬁnal cloud size; Section 4 describes and contrasts
the performance of diﬀerent magnetic lenses; Section 5 contains a discussion and
concluding remarks.

2. Alternate-gradient lens theory

−

An atom in a magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude B experiences a magnetic dipole interaction
energy of U =
µζB, where µζ is the projection of the atom’s magnetic moment onto
the ﬁeld direction. Provided that Majorana spin-ﬂip transitions [18] occuring in ﬁeld
zeros are avoided and the rate of change of direction of the ﬁeld is less than the Larmor
frequency the magnetic moment adiabatically follows the ﬁeld.

U =

The Stern-Gerlach force is ~FSG =

(µζ B). The ensemble (of alkali metal
atoms) can be optically pumped into either a strong-ﬁeld-seeking state with µζ = µB
(where µB is the Bohr magneton), or into a weak-ﬁeld-seeking state with µζ =
µB.
In low ﬁeld, where the quantum numbers F and mF are good, these states are the
stretched states
. Atoms in these states have a magnetic
i
moment which is independent of ﬁeld, consequently the Stern-Gerlach force takes the
simpler form ~FSG =
B — i.e. the focusing of the atoms is governed by the
±
gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude only.

The choice of whether atoms in weak or strong-ﬁeld seeking states are launched
depends on the particular application. We discussed extensively in [13] the focusing
of atoms in weak-ﬁeld-seeking states. This was because single-impulse 3D imaging
of strong-ﬁeld-seeking states requires a maximum of the magnetic ﬁeld in free space,
which is forbidden by Earnshaw’s theorem [19].

We refer to a lens with a ﬁeld expansion of the form B as a one-dimensional lens,
as it can be used either to focus axially (with simultaneous radial defocusing), when
B2 is positive, or to focus radially (with simultaneous axial defocusing) when B2 is
negative. In order to achieve a 3D focus with the lenses of equation (2), an axially
converging lens pulse must be followed by an appropriately timed axially diverging
lens (or vice versa). This is referred to as the “alternate gradient” focusing method,
and has the advantage of being able to focus both weak-ﬁeld and strong-ﬁeld seeking
atoms. This method is used extensively in particle accelerators [20], for focusing
polar molecules [21], and is shown schematically in Figure 1. Useful parameters for
describing the evolution of a Gaussian atomic cloud are the axial (σz) and radial (σz)
rms cloud radii (the standard deviations), as well as their aspect ratio ξ = σz/σr.

Figure 1. The principle of alternate gradient focusing. The upper image,
Strategy AR, shows the evolution of the axial (σz, green) and radial (σr , black)
cloud radii when an axially converging (radially diverging) lens precedes an axially
diverging (radially converging) lens and leads to a sausage-shaped cloud (ξ > 1).
In the lower image, Strategy RA, the lens order is reversed, leading to a pancake-
shaped cloud (ξ < 1). The eﬀects of gravity (in the −z direction along the coil
axis) are not shown, but are included in simulations. Due to the time reversal
symmetry of optics, the lens system also works backwards.

As shown in reference [13] there exist optimal conﬁgurations for realising radial
and axial focusing lenses. These are achieved with a pair of separated coaxial coils,
where both coils have equal current with the same sense. An important lens parameter
is the relative separation S of the coils in units of the coil radius. The harmonicity
of a radially-focusing lens is optimized if S = 0.58 (red lenses in Figure 1); whereas
the harmonicity of an axially-focusing lens is optimized if S = 2.63 (blue lenses in
Figure 1). In the remainder of this work it is assumed that these optimized lenses are
used.

3. Magnetic impulses and the ABCD formalism

The separable equations of motion for an axially and cylindrically symmetric coil
system lead to a lens that is harmonic in 3D with an acceleration given by equation
(2), which allows the motion in each cartesian dimension to be treated as a separate
simple harmonic equation. The inﬂuence of a magnetic lens can be described by
ABCD
matrices, as outlined in [12, 13]. The initial and ﬁnal position and velocity of an atom
along a given Cartesian axis, say x, are related via the equation:

To obtain an atom cloud which is focused in all 3 dimensions requires that
the ﬁrst lens is axially converging (radially diverging) and the second lens is axially
diverging (radially converging), or vice versa. Moreover, the radial (subscript r) and
axial (subscript z) spatial dimensions have diﬀerent
coeﬃcients. If the two
axial lens strengths are ω1z and ω2z, then equation (2) yields ω1r = iω1z/√2 and
ω2r = iω2z/√2. A 3D image is formed when equation (8) is set equal to zero for both
the radial and axial directions.

4. A measure of the quality of the focus

The attributes of parabolic lenses are unimportant, unless it can be shown that
experimentally realistic lenses are suﬃciently parabolic for such an approximation
to be appropriate. At the end of [13] there appeared to be a major diﬀerence between
the parabolic approximation and real lenses. To some extent, this may have been due
to the way the lens properties were measured.

≈

In [13] numerical integration of the forces arising from the magnetic ﬁelds due to
current loops (generated by the Biot-Savart law) was used, to track the trajectories
of several (
1000) simulated atoms. The initial positions and velocities of the atoms
were randomly assigned, weighted according to isotropic Gaussian spatial and velocity
distributions with 1D standard deviations of σR = 0.4 mm and σV = 4.4 cm/s (as
discussed in the previous section). The way in which the harmonicity of a lens was
measured was to compare the expected harmonic focus size to the rms radii of the
simulated atom cloud at the time of the harmonic focus. The important drawback of
this rms approach is that the ﬁnal location of atoms after a magnetic lens is highly
nonlinear with respect to initial conditions. An atom with a velocity in the wings of
the initial Gaussian distribution will experience highly anharmonic lensing, as it will
be far from the centre of the lens during the magnetic impulse. Thus a few atoms can
completely alter the rms width of the cloud.

Another method to quantify the focus, adopted here, is to monitor the fraction of
the atoms entering the focus region of a purely harmonic lens. If the initial radial and
axial cloud standard deviations are σr and σz, then the ﬁnal standard deviations for a
zσz. By renormalising the dimensions so that the radial
harmonic lens are
and axial dimensions are measured in terms of these ﬁnal focus standard deviations,
then a sphere with radius R0 = 1.53817 deﬁned by
r2e− r
0 r2e− r2
R

will contain half of the atoms of the focussed Gaussian distribution. For numerical
simulations the fraction of atoms entering this harmonic focus are measured, and
multiplied by twice the relative density increase of a purely harmonic lens (i.e.
) to get a measure of the relative density increase aﬀorded by a real lens.
2
Note that the centre of the harmonic focus region, as well as the centre about
which the rms radius is deﬁned,
is the ﬁnal position of an atom initially in the
centre of the Gaussian position and velocity distributions. This will lead to a slight
underestimation in the density increase regardless of which way its deﬁned (it has
been assumed the mean cloud position follows the initial centre-of-mass). In addition
the density can increase if the best experimental 3D focus occurs at a time other than
the best parabolic lens focus time, but the focus time has been allowed to vary in the
simulations. For more details on the eﬀects of launched atoms in gravity, namely that
even the centre-of-mass atoms will experience time-varying radial and axial harmonic
trap frequencies, see the Appendix.

4.1. Single-impulse focusing revisited

In light of the above discussion, 3D single-impulse focusing outlined in [13] is brieﬂy
revisited, in particular Strategy VI: the baseball coil system. This system consisted
of a square baseball coil with side lengths w and a coil pair of radius w separated by

Double-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms

w that were coaxial with the baseball coil axis. The current in the baseball coil was
10, 000 Amp-turns, and an isotropic lens is formed when the coil pair has a current
In this paper we have made the value w = 4 cm, leading to
of 1, 541 Amp-turns.
an angular frequency ω = 62 rad/s in the harmonic lens. This is to provide a better
comparison between single- and double-impulse techniques.

In Figure 3 the relative density increase after the baseball lens is plotted in terms
of the parameter λ (the eﬀective time of the baseball lens relative to T ). The red
dots correspond to the relative density increase using rms widths for the volume. The
blue dots show the relative density increase as the fraction of atoms in the harmonic
focus zone times the harmonic density increase. It is clear that we reach very diﬀerent
conclusions based on whether the rms radius of the focused atomic cloud, or the
fraction of atoms which reach the harmonic focus are considered.

By only looking at rms widths the optimum lens position occurs at λ = 0.3,
corresponding to a factor of 50 decrease in density. However considering the fraction
of atoms in the harmonic focus zone times the harmonic density increase, the optimum
position is now λ = 0.9. The relative density increase is 2.3, which corresponds to
0.3% of the cloud focused to a density 729 times greater than it was originally.

The source of this discrepancy between methods can be seen in Figure 3 (b-c)
where the non-Gaussian wings produce an over estimate of the rms cloud width. The y
and z standard deviations for the Gaussian ﬁts (black curves) are 730 µm and 820 µm
respectively; an almost isotropic distribution.

Image (a) shows the relative density increase (with error bars, for

and (c) show the spatial probability distributions at the focus (black dots) in the
y and z directions, respectively, where the non-Gaussian wings of the distribution
can be clearly seen. These two distributions are taken with a lens at λ = 0.5
where 1/6 of the atoms are in the harmonic focus region.

4.2. Alternate gradient

This section compares the alternate gradient numerical simulations with the purely
harmonic lenses of section 3. The (τ1, τ2) sample co-ordinates illustrated in Figure 2(b-
c) are used, in order to run numerical simulations for the relative density increases
illustrated in Figure 4. We have not (cf. Figure 3) used the rms volume of the cloud
to show the relative density increases as these result in extremely low relative density

Figure 4.

For both strategies the numerical simulations trace the shape of the analytical
relative density increase although aberrations result in reduced increases. The
maximum relative density increases in (a) and (b) are 186 and 50 respectively. This is
a marked improvement on the single-impulse focusing, however the cloud distribution
17 in (a)
is no longer isotropic. The harmonic focus aspect ratio has a range 12

Figure 4.
Images (a) and (b) use the (τ1, τ2) co-ordinates illustrated in
Figure 2(b) and (c) to show the relative density increase for alternate gradient
lensing Strategies AR and RA, respectively. There were 1000 atoms in the
simulation and relative density increases are shown for a pure harmonic lens (black
curve), as well as the relative density increase for the fraction of atoms in a real
lens arriving at the harmonic focus region (blue dots with error bars). In image
(c) the strong spatial bimodal nature of the x focus for the leftmost point in (a)
is clearly seen on a log scale.

Given comparable lens dimensions and strengths, double-impulse magnetic
focusing is far superior to single-impulse magnetic focusing in terms of the relative
density increases that can be achieved by a fraction of the atoms. This result is in
stark contrast to the relative rms density increase of the entire cloud, which would
lead to the opposite conclusion.

5. Discussion and conclusion

The main application of interest for the magnetically imaged atoms will be loading a
magnetic microtrap or optical dipole trap, for which alternate gradient imaging is well-
suited. The trap is harmonic, with a large capture volume, then the rms size of the
cloud will be linked to the equilibrium temperature after elastic collisions rethermalise
the initially bimodal image distribution. In order to keep the high density core of the
atomic cloud, the high energy atoms must be removed on a time scale that is rapid
compared to rethermalisation - this could be achieved with strong RF evaporative

cooling or by shining resonant dark SPOT beams [22] at the focal region. A trap with
a small capture volume, e.g. an atom chip [16] or a focused optical dipole beam trap
[17], is ideal as only the high density core of atoms will be captured in the trap. In
each dimension the trap frequency of the ﬁnal harmonic trap must be higher than
the initial trap frequency by an amount inversely proportional to the atomic cloud’s
magniﬁcation in that dimension. Otherwise mode-matching cannot be achieved and
the phase-space density of the high density atoms will be compromised.

In this paper we have used experimentally realistic parameters to compare the
limiting focal size of a launched cold cloud of weak-ﬁeld seeking atoms subject to
either a single or double magnetic lens impulse. The
matrix formalism was
convenient for giving an estimate as to the parameters needed for magnetic focusing,
but numerical simulations were necessary to detect the eﬀects of aberrations in real
magnetic lenses. If one wishes to minimise the rms image volume of a launched cloud
then a single-impulse lens is preferable. If, however, one can selectively capture the
central core of the bi-modal image, a double-impulse (alternate gradient) lens can lead
to orders of magnitude relative density increases for both pancake- and sausage-shaped
image clouds.

Appendix: modelling time varying lens strengths

This paper has only discussed parabolic lenses with constant strength ω, pulsed on
with a top-hat pulse of duration τ .
In experiments the lens strength is a function
of time, partly because the current in a real coil is not a top-hat pulse, and partly
because the centre-of-mass of a launched atomic cloud changes as it goes through a
lens and thus (to second order in position) will experience a time-varying parabolic
lens. In practice it was unnecessary to adjust the timing or lens coil positions to allow
for these eﬀects in the simulations, however we brieﬂy discuss ways around this issue
should it become problematic.

A harmonic lens with arbitrary time variation ω(t) (where ω(t) and its derivatives
are zero outside the experimental pulse time t1
t1+τ1), is equivalent to an inﬁnite
product of inﬁnitesimal 2
2 translation and thin lens matrices, resulting in a single
2

One can then use an iterative 4D Newton-Raphson method with four input

lens, and

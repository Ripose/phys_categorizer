We use an all-optical trap to conﬁne a strongly attractive two-state mixture of lithium fermions. By
measuring the rate of evaporation from the trap, we determine the eﬀective elastic scattering cross
2 to show that the magnitude of the scattering length |a| is very large, in agreement with
section 4πa
predictions. We show that the mixture is stable against inelastic decay provided that a small bias
magnetic ﬁeld is applied. For this system, the s-wave interaction is widely tunable at low magnetic
ﬁeld, and can be turned on and oﬀ rapidly via a Raman π pulse. Hence, this mixture is well suited
for fundamental studies of an interacting Fermi gas.

Trapped, ultracold atomic vapors oﬀer exciting new
opportunities for fundamental studies of an interacting
Fermi gas in which the temperature, density and interac-
tion strength can be independently controlled. Recently,
a degenerate gas of fermionic 40K has been produced by
using a two-state mixture to enable s-wave scattering and
evaporation in a magnetic trap [1]. By removing one
species, the properties of the noninteracting degenerate
gas were measured, demonstrating that the momentum
distribution and the total energy obey Fermi-Dirac statis-
tics [1]. However, the properties of interacting two-state
fermionic vapors have not been explored experimentally.
Theoretical treatments of an interacting Fermi gas
have focused extensively on 6Li
[2–9]. Certain two-
state 6Li mixtures are predicted to be strongly attractive,
i.e., they have anomalously large and negative scattering
lengths [10] arising from a near-zero energy resonance in
the triplet state [11]. It has been predicted that these
strongly attractive mixtures can undergo a transition to
a superﬂuid state at a relatively high transition tempera-
ture [2,4]. In addition, the two-state eﬀective interaction
potential is widely tunable in a magnetic ﬁeld, permit-
ting systematic studies of fundamental phenomena such
as collective oscillations for both the normal and super-
ﬂuid phases [3,5,6], as well as new tests of superconduc-
tivity theory [4].

Unfortunately, magnetically trappable mixtures in 6Li
with large s-wave scattering lengths are not stable, since
there are correspondingly large spin-exchange and dipo-
lar decay rates [2,7,10]. Hence, the methods employed to
study degenerate 40K are not applicable. For this reason,
we developed an ultrastable CO2 laser trap to conﬁne a
stable mixture of the two lowest 6Li hyperﬁne states [12].
However, attaining a large and negative scattering length
in this mixture requires high magnetic ﬁelds B ≥ 800 G
to exploit either a Feshbach resonance or the triplet scat-
tering length [7,10].

In this Letter, we show that there exists another sta-
ble hyperﬁne state mixture in 6Li which has the following
unique properties. First, we predict that the scattering
length a is large, negative, and widely tunable at low
magnetic ﬁeld B. By monitoring the rate of evaporation

from the CO2 laser trap at a ﬁxed well depth, we measure
|a| = 540+210
−100 a0 at B = 8.3 G. This result conﬁrms for
the ﬁrst time that very large scattering lengths exist in
6Li mixtures. The predicted scattering length is −490 a0
at B = 8.3 G, consistent with our observations, and is
expected to increase to −1615 a0 as B → 0. Second,
we ﬁnd that this system is stable against spin exchange
collisions provided that B 6= 0. In addition, the dipolar
decay rate is predicted to be very small [13], consistent
with our observations. Finally, in the experiments, a Ra-
man π pulse is employed to abruptly create an interacting
mixture from a noninteracting one, a desirable feature for
studies of many-body quantum dynamics [14].

FIG. 2. Magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the scattering length

a31 for a mixture of the |3i and |1i hyperﬁne states of 6Li.

Fig. 2 shows the scattering length a31 for the |3i − |1i
mixture as a function of magnetic bias ﬁeld B. We es-
timate a31(B) by using the asymptotic boundary con-
dition (ABC) approximation [10]. This calculation in-
corporates the singlet and triplet scattering lengths [11],
aS = 45.5±2.5 a0 and aT = −2160±250 a0, and a bound-
ary radius which we take to be R = 40 a0 [10]. The scat-
tering length varies from −1620 a0 (≃ 3aT /4 as B → 0)
to −480 a0 at B = 10 G. The results of our approximate
calculation for B = 0 to B = 200 G are conﬁrmed within
10% by van Abeelen and Verhaar [13] using a coupled
channel calculation which includes the uncertainties in
the potentials. At higher ﬁelds, near 800 G, we believe
the scattering length exhibits a Feshbach resonance (not
shown). Above this resonance, the scattering length ap-
proaches the triplet scattering length of −2160 a0.
The |3i − |1i mixture is stable against spin-exchange
collisions provided that a small bias magnetic ﬁeld is
applied. Spin-exchange inelastic collisions conserve the
two-particle total magnetic quantum number MT , where
MT = −1 for the |{3, 1}i state. Note that {,} denotes
the antisymmetric two-particle spin state, as required
for s-wave scattering which dominates at low tempera-
tures. There are no lower-lying antisymmetric states with
MT = −1. Hence, exothermic collisions are precluded.
The only other states with MT = −1 are |{4, 2}i and
|{5, 3}i. Without an adequate bias magnetic ﬁeld, transi-
tions to these states lead to population in level |4i. Then,
exothermic |{3, 4}i → |{3, 2}i and |{4, 1}i → |{1, 2}i
collisions can occur. With an adequate bias magnetic
ﬁeld, the energy of states |{4, 2}i and |{5, 3}i can be in-
creased relative to that of state |{3, 1}i by more than
the maximum relative kinetic energy, i.e., twice the well
depth during evaporative cooling. By energy conserva-
tion, spin-exchange transfer is then suppressed. In this
case, the inelastic rate is limited to magnetic dipole-
dipole (dipolar) interactions which contain a rank 2 rela-
tive coordinate operator of even parity [2]. Since parity is
conserved and p − wave → p − wave scattering is frozen

2

out at low temperature, the dominant dipolar process is
a small s → d rate in which |{3, 1}i → |{1, 2}i [13].
In the experiments, the CO2 laser trap is initially
loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) [12]. At
the end of the loading period, the MOT laser beams are
tuned near resonance and the intensity is lowered to de-
crease the temperature. Then, optical pumping is used
to empty the F = 3/2 state to produce a 50-50 mixture
of the |1i − |2i states. These states are noninteracting
at low magnetic ﬁeld, i.e, the scattering amplitude van-
ishes as a result of an accidental cancellation [10]. With
a CO2 laser trap depth of 330 µK, up to 4×105 atoms are
conﬁned in the lowest-lying hyperﬁne states at an initial
temperature between 100 and 200 µK. A bias magnetic
ﬁeld of 8.3 G is applied to split the two-particle energy
states by ≃ 16 MHz. This is twice the maximum attain-
able energy at our largest well depth of 400 µK = 8 MHz.
After a delay of 0.5 second relative to the loading phase,
a pair of optical ﬁelds is pulsed on to induce a Raman
π pulse. This pulse transfers the population in state |2i
to state |3i in two microseconds, initiating evaporative
cooling in the resulting |3i − |1i mixture. The optical
ﬁelds are detuned from resonance with the D2 transition
by ≃ 700 MHz to suppress optical pumping. If the Ra-
man pulse is not applied, the trapped atoms remain in
the noninteracting |1i−|2i mixture and exhibit a purely
exponential decay with a time constant ≃ 300 seconds.
An acousto-optic modulator (A/O) in front of the CO2
laser controls the laser intensity, which is reduced to yield
a shallow trap depth of 100 µK. By using a shallow well,
we avoid the problem that the elastic cross section be-
comes independent of the scattering length at high en-
ergy, as described below. In addition, the shallow well
greatly reduces the number of loaded atoms and makes
the sample optically thin, simplifying calibration of the
number of trapped atoms. To determine the trap pa-
rameters, the laser power is modulated and parametric
resonances [15] are observed at drive frequencies of 2ν for
three diﬀerent trap oscillation frequencies ν: At 100 µK
well depth, νx = 2.4 kHz νy = 1.8 kHz and νz = 100 Hz,
where the trap laser beam propagates along z. Using the
measured total power as a constraint, we obtain the trap
intensity 1/e2 radii, wx = 50 µm and wy = 67 µm, and
the axial intensity 1/e2 length, zf ≃ 1.13 mm, where zf
is consistent with the expected Rayleigh length within
15%.

The number of atoms in the trap N (t) is estimated
using a calibrated photomultiplier. The detection sys-
tem monitors the ﬂuorescence induced by pulsed, retrore-
ﬂected, σ± probe and repumper beams which are strongly
saturating (I/Isat = 26 for the strongest transition).
To simplify calibration, only the isotropic component of
the ﬂuorescence angular distribution is measured: The
collecting lens is placed at the magic angle [16] of 55◦
(P2(cos θ) = 0) with respect to the propagation direction
of the probe beams. The net eﬃciency of the detection
system is determined using laser light of known power.
The primary uncertainty in the calibration arises from

the excited state population fraction, which we estimate
lies between 1/4 and 1/2.

FIG. 3. Number of trapped atoms versus time for evapo-
ration of a |3i − |1i mixture of 6Li at a ﬁxed well depth of
100 µK. The solid curve shows the s-wave Boltzmann equa-
tion ﬁt for a scattering length of |a31| = 540 a0. Inset: 0-1
second.

Fig. 3 shows the number of trapped atoms N (t) mea-
sured for the |3i−|1i mixture at a well depth U0 = 100 µK
and a bias ﬁeld of 8.3 G as a function of time between
5 ms and 20 seconds after evaporation is initiated. For
times beyond 50 seconds (not shown), the evaporation
stagnates, and we observe an exponential decay of the
cooled |3i − |1i mixture with a time constant of 370 sec-
onds over a period of a few hundred seconds. The error
bars are the standard deviation of the mean of ten com-
plete runs through the entire time sequence.

A model based on the s-wave Boltzmann equation [17]
is used to predict N (t) for comparison to the experiments.
This equation is modiﬁed to include the density of states
for a gaussian potential well [12] and to include the en-
ergy dependence of the elastic cross section. Assuming
a short range potential and a symmetric (s-wave) spatial
state, the cross section takes the form

σ(k) =

8πa2
31
1 + k2a2
31

,

(1)

where ¯hk is the relative momentum. For k|a31| << 1,
the cross section is maximized. When k|a31| >> 1, the
cross section approaches the unitarity limit 8π/k2 which
is independent of a31. Note that k|a31| = 1 corresponds
to a relative kinetic energy of ǫ = ¯h2/(2µ a2
31), where µ =
M/2 is the reduced mass. For |a31| = 500 a0, ǫ = 115 µK.
For a two-state mixture of fermions, the eﬀective cross
section is reduced from that of Eq. 1 by a factor of 2 since
pairs of colliding atoms are in an antisymmetric hyper-
ﬁne state with a probability 1/2. This eﬀective cross
section is used in a Boltzmann collision integral for each
state i = 1, 3. A decay term −Ni(t)/τ with τ = 370 sec

3

is added to account for the measured trap lifetime. A
detailed description of our coupled Boltzmann equation
model will be published elsewhere.

The coupled s-wave Boltzmann equations for the two
states are numerically integrated to determine N (t) using
the well parameters as ﬁxed inputs. From the calibrated
photomultiplier signal, assuming that 1/3 of the atoms
are in the excited state, we obtain an initial total number
N0 = 44, 000. For this case, the initial collision rate
in Hz is estimated to be 1/(2πτc) ≃ N0M σ0ν 3/(kBT ),
31, and M is the 6Li mass.
where ν 3 = νxνyνz, σ0 = 8πa2
Assuming |a31| = 500 a0, τc = 30 ms. Hence, for t > 0.3
seconds, when on average 10 collisions have occurred, the
sample should be thermalized as assumed in the theory.
The best ﬁt to the data starting with 22,000 atoms in
each state is shown as the solid curve in Fig. 3. The χ2
per degree of freedom for this ﬁt is 1.4 and is found to be
very sensitive to the initial temperature T0 of the atoms
in the optical trap. ¿From the ﬁt, we ﬁnd T0 = 46µK,
which is less than the well depth. We believe that this
low temperature is a consequence of the MOT gradient
magnet, which is turned oﬀ after the MOT laser beams.
The eﬀective well depth of the optical trap is therefore
reduced until the gradient is fully oﬀ, allowing hotter
atoms to escape before the Raman pulse is applied to
create the |3i − |1i mixture. The ﬁt is most sensitive to
data for t > 0.5 second, where the thermal approxima-
tion is expected to be valid. From the ﬁt, we obtain the
scattering length |a31| = 540± 25 a0, which is within 10%
of the predictions of Fig. 2. The quoted error corresponds
to a change of 1 in the total χ2.

We determine the systematic errors in a31 due to the
uncertainties in the calibration and in the population im-
balance as follows. The data is ﬁt for an initial num-
ber of atoms N0 of 58,000 and 29,000, corresponding to
an excited state fraction of 1/4 and 1/2. This yields
|a31| = 440 ± 20 a0 and |a31| = 750 ± 42 a0, respectively.
Note that for the larger scattering lengths, the cross sec-
tion given by Eq. 1 approaches the unitarity limit and
the error increases. We assume that the initial popula-
tion imbalance for states |3i and |1i is comparable to that
of states |2i and |1i in the optically pumped MOT. To
estimate the latter population imbalance, we use state-
selective Raman π pulses to excite |2i → |3i or |1i → |6i
transitions in the MOT. Probe-induced ﬂuorescence sig-
nals from states |3i or |6i show that the initial |1i and
|2i populations are equal within 10%. Note that resid-
ual population in state |2i is expected to be stable and
weakly interacting, since we estimate |a32| < 30 a0 for
0 ≤ B ≤ 50 G using the ABC method, and a12 ≃ 0 [10].
Using the parameters for the ﬁt shown in Fig. 3, but
changing the initial mixture from 50-50 to 60-40, we ﬁnd
a slight increase in the ﬁtted scattering length from 540 a0
to 563 a0. Thus, the uncertainty in the calibration of the
number of atoms produces the dominant uncertainty and
|a31| = 540+210
To demonstrate that evaporative cooling is occuring,
rather than just trap loss, we have also measured the

−100 a0.

ﬁnal temperature of the mixture using release and recap-
ture [18] from the CO2 laser trap. We obtain 9.8± 1 µK,
which is within 10 % of the ﬁnal temperature of 8.7 µK
predicted by the Boltzmann equation model. An excel-
lent ﬁt to the data is obtained for the ﬁnal temperature,
which describes a thermal distribution. However, the ini-
tial temperature is not so readily measured, as it is non-
thermal before evaporation is initiated, and is rapidly
changing during evaporation, unlike the ﬁnal tempera-
ture, which stagnates.

Good ﬁts to the evaporation data are obtained neglect-
ing inelastic collisions, suggesting that the dipolar rate
for the |3i − |1i mixture is small, in contrast to the scat-
tering length. A limit on the dipolar loss rate for the
|3i − |1i mixture can be estimated from the τ = 370 sec-
ond lifetime of the mixture after evaporation stagnates.
For equal populations in both states, dipolar decay re-
sults in an initial loss rate ˙n = −Gn2/4, where G is the
dipolar rate constant and n is the total density. To ob-
tain a high density, the trap is loaded at a well depth
of 330 µK and the temperature of the atoms is reduced
by evaporation to T ≃ 30 ± 1 µK. The number of atoms
remaining in each state after evaporation is estimated to
be N = 6.5 ± 2.2 × 104, where the uncertainty is in the
calibration. We cannot rule out the possibility that one
state is depleted on a long time scale, since we do not
directly measure the individual state populations. How-
ever, we believe that, after evaporation stagnates in the
deep well, a |3i − |1i mixture remains, since subsequent
reduction of the well depth yields ﬁnal temperatures con-
sistent with evaporative cooling. Note that the mixture
ratio is not critical: An 80-20 mixture yields an initial
loss rate ˙n = −0.16 Gn2, ≃ 2/3 that of a 50/50 mixture.
For a ﬁxed 330 µK trap depth, ν 3 = 2.6 ± 0.3 kHz3, and
the phase space density for one state in the harmonic
approximation is then ρph = N/(kBT /hν)3 = 7 × 10−4.
This corresponds to a maximum total density of n =
B = 6.4 × 1011/cm3, where λB ≡ h/√2πM kBT .
2 ρph/λ3
Since the exponential decay time of the |3i−|1i mixture
is similar to that obtained in the noninteracting |1i− |2i
mixture, we assume the loss is dominated by background
gas collisions. Thus, we must have Gn/4 << 1/τ , which
yields G << 2 × 10−14cm3/sec. This result is consis-
tent with the value G ≃ 2 × 10−15 cm3/sec predicted for
the dipolar rate constant at 30 µK by van Abeelen and
Verhaar [13].

Future experiments will employ continuous evapora-
tion by slowly reducing the well depth [19]. In this case,
very large scattering lengths can be obtained at low tem-
peratures and small well depths by using a reduced bias
magnetic ﬁeld B. By adiabatically recompressing the
well, experiments can be carried out with the precooled
atoms in a deep trap to obtain high density as well. In
such experiments, the ﬁnal low temperature limits the
number of atoms in the high energy tail of the energy dis-
tribution, exponentially suppressing spin-exchange colli-
sions for B 6= 0. For example, if a total of 3 × 105 atoms
were contained in our trap at a well depth of 400 µK, the

4

Fermi temperature TF = 7 µK and the Fermi density is
4× 1013/cm3. At a temperature of T = 0.1 TF = 0.7 µK,
a bias ﬁeld of B = 0.16 G would split the two-particle
hyperﬁne states by kBTF + 12 kBT , suppressing the spin
exchange rate by exp(−12), and giving a31 ≃ −1200 a0.
Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 2, large a31 can be ob-
tained at moderate B ≃ 300 G.
In conclusion, we have observed that an optically
trapped |3i − |1i mixture of 6Li atoms has a very large
scattering length at low magnetic ﬁeld. This mixture
is stable against spin-exchange collisions provided that
a small bias magnetic ﬁeld is applied. The evaporation
curves measured for this mixture are in good agreement
with a model based on an s-wave Boltzmann equation
which neglects inelastic processes. We have predicted
that the scattering interactions are strongly attractive
and widely tunable at low magnetic ﬁeld. If the param-
eters described above for deep wells can be attained, the
system will be close to the threshold for superﬂuidity [2]
and ideal for investigating frequency shifts and damp-
ing in collective oscillations [3,5]. Further, since s-wave
interactions can be turned on and oﬀ in a few microsec-
onds, this system is well suited for studies of many-body
quantum dynamics.

The optimized eﬀective potential equations for atoms have been solved by parameterizing the
potential. The expansion is tailored to fulﬁll the known asymptotic behavior of the eﬀective potential
at both short and long distances. Both single conﬁguration and multi conﬁguration trial wave
functions are implemented. Applications to several atomic systems are presented improving previous
works. The results here obtained are very close to those calculated in either the Hartree-Fock and
the multi conﬁgurational Hartree-Fock framework.

INTRODUCTION

The Hartree-Fock (HF) method is the best approxi-
mation to the atomic and molecular problem in the inde-
pendent particle model with a single conﬁguration. Orig-
inally it was formulated in terms of a single Slater de-
terminant but in current applications a single conﬁgura-
tion, with one or more Slater determinants coupled in
[1]. An alternative to
the LS scheme, is used, see e.g.
the HF equations, always within the independent par-
ticle model, is given by the Optimized Eﬀective Poten-
tial (OEP) method proposed by Sharp and Horton [2] as
a variational alternative to the Slater’s simpliﬁed treat-
ment of the exchange term in the HF equations based on
the averaging in the occupied orbitals [3].

In the OEP method an additional constraint is im-
posed into the variational problem: the orbitals must
satisfy a single-particle Schr¨odinger equation with a cer-
tain local potential, the same for all the electrons (with
the same spin). The expectation value of the hamilto-
nian of the N-electron system becomes a functional of
such a local potential. The eﬀective potential is then
varied to minimize the total energy. This gives rise to a
linear integral equation in the eﬀective potential [2, 4]
whose solution gives the optimized eﬀective potential.
The wave function of the system is then constructed from
the single–particle wave functions which are eigenfunc-
tions of the optimized eﬀective potential.

The OEP method has been used in connection with the
Kohn–Sham density functional theory [5, 6, 7, 8]. Accu-
rate spin–polarized exchange–only Kohn–Shan potential
has been constructed with the OEP method [9]. The lo-
cal exchange potential obtained from the OEP method
has many of the analytical features of the exact Kohn-
Sham potential, and it has been recognized as the exact
implementation of exchange-only density functional the-
ory [10]. For example the HF potential can support very
few unoccupied excited states because of its exponential
fall oﬀ and therefore it is not a good starting point to
describe excited states. On the other hand as the OEP
potentials presents the proper long range behavior it pro-
vides better excitation energies.

The use and application of the original form of the

OEP was hindered because of the computational diﬃ-
culties posed by the OEP integral equation.
Initially,
a numerical grid method was employed by Talman and
Shadwick [4] to solve this equation and further more ac-
curate calculations for atoms have been carried out by
using a more reﬁned mesh [11, 12]. Also some approxi-
mations to the OEP equations were proposed [13]. Very
recently an iterative scheme based on solving the par-
tial diﬀerential equations satisﬁed by the orbitals shift
that satisfy exactly the Krieger, Li and Iafrate approxi-
mation has been devised [14]. An alternative methodol-
ogy to board this problem uses a ﬁnite basis set expan-
sion and/or analytical forms for the eﬀective potential
[8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. The parameterization
of the eﬀective potential simpliﬁes greatly the numerical
problem of solving the integral equations [8, 16, 19, 22].
The explicit form or the parameterization is proposed by
using diﬀerent arguments [16, 19, 23]. The parameters
can been ﬁxed either by using the variational method or
by matching the one-body eigenvalues of the correspond-
ing spin-averaged Dirac equation to the experimentally
observed one-electron ionization energies [17].

The aim of this work is to obtain the energy and other
properties for atoms in the parameterized OEP approxi-
mation. The analytical form used for the optimized po-
tential has been used previously [15, 17] but with sim-

pler expansions.
of free parameters in the eﬀective potential until conver-
gence is reached. In this way we improve previous results
obtained not only within the parameterized OEP scheme
but also by solving numerically the integral equation. We
have studied the ground state of the atoms Li to Ar in the
LS coupling. Finally the OEP approximation is extended
here to multi conﬁguration wave functions in the same
spirit of the Multi Conﬁguration Hartree Fock method.
The binding energy, single particle energies and exchange
energies are obtained and compared systematically with
their Hartree-Fock counterparts. The best results for the
energy of the present work are roughly 1 mhartree above
the best self consistent ﬁeld results showing the good per-
formance of the local potential approximation.

The structure of this work is as follows. In Section II
we show in detail the parameterization and the algorithm

used. The results obtained are reported and discussed
in Section III. The conclusions and perspectives of this
work can be found in Section IV. Atomic units are used
throughout.

II. PARAMETERIZED OPTIMIZED
EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL

The single–particle wave functions used to construct
the Slater determinants of a given single conﬁguration
are the eigenfunctions of the so called eﬀective potential,
that in this work is taken to be central,

−

~∇2 + Ve(r)

2

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

φλ,σ(~r) = ǫλφλ,σ(~r)

(1)

where λ and σ stand for the spatial and spin quantum
numbers, respectively.

The total energy of the system is therefore a functional
of this single particle potential. The minimum condition
on this potential leads to the OEP equations [2] ﬁxing
the best eﬀective potential. The energy so obtained will
be an upper bound to the exact one and it will be above
the HF value. It is also worth pointing out that the role
of the eﬀective potential here is just an auxiliary function
used to calculate the orbitals in the wave function.

The parameterization chosen in this work for the eﬀec-

tive potential is

ck,0 = 1

n0

k=1
X

imposed in order to match the correct short-range be-
havior of the potential. This constraint makes that we
must deal with, at least, two terms with p = 0, i.e.
n0 ≥ 2. With respect to the long range asymptotic be-
havior, this functional form is such that the potential
goes as −(Z − N + 1)/r for large electron-nucleus dis-
tances. The number of basis functions used to expand
the eﬀective potential is incremented systematically until
convergence is reached. As we shall see later the impor-
tance of considering higher values of p increases with the
number of electrons. Finally it is worth mentioning here
that regular behavior close to the nucleus has shown to
be relevant in local eﬀective potential theories [24].

The algorithm is the following

1. Pick the initial values of the eﬀective potential pa-
rameters, ck,p and βk,p such that the short and long
range asymptotic behaviors are satisﬁed.

2. Solve the one-electron Schr¨odinger equation for

each occupied orbital.

2

3. Use these orbitals to build up the N-electron wave
function and calculate the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian.

4. Optimize the total energy with respect to the free
parameters (ck,p, βk,p) with the constraint given by
equation 3.

5. Increase the size of the expansion of the eﬀective

potential until convergence.

The single–particle Schr¨odinger equation 1 in step 3
is solved by expanding the radial orbitals in a basis set
of Slater type functions as in the Roothaan-Hartree-Fock
method. In particular we have used the same size of the
basis set as in reference [25]: the s-type single particle
orbitals are expanded by using 6 basis functions for the
Li to Ne atoms and 8 basis functions for the Na to Ar
atoms. The radial part of p-type single particle orbitals
is developed as the sum of 4 basis functions for the B
to Ne atoms, 5 basis functions for Na and Mg and 8 ba-
sis functions for the atoms Al to Ar. By doing this all
the diﬀerent matrix elements can be computed analyti-
cally. The total energy has been minimized with respect
to the free parameters of the eﬀective potential by using
a SIMPLEX [26] algorithm.

Once obtained the single particle wave functions we
can calculate some other quantities of interest such as
the exchange energy

where I, J and K are the usual single particle, direct
and exchange terms calculated starting from the eigen-
functions of the eﬀective potential. The single particle
energies ǫHF
of equation 5 does not coincide with the

eigenvalues ǫλ of equation 1, except for the highest oc-
cupied orbital. This was proven in reference [27] within

study this condition states that ǫHF
λh = ǫλh , where λh
stands for the highest occupied level. The fulﬁllment of
this condition has been used previously, e.g.
[5, 12] to
asses the accuracy in the solution of the OEP equations.
In general the optimization procedure is very stable for
both the total energy and the Hartree–Fock values ǫHF
λ .
However this is not the case for the eigenvalue ǫλ, as has
been noted previously [9, 12] by using a numerical grid
method. For this reason, and because the exact solution
of the OEP must also satisfy the virial relation and the
exchange–only virial relation [28, 29] we have minimized
the quantity

and Vx is the exchange potential. By doing this no signif-
icant changes are found for both the total energy and the
Hartree–Fock eigenvalues. One should expect that this
procedure gives rise to a better description of the asymp-
totic region of the optimized eﬀective potential. As it has
been previously pointed out [5] these two conditions are
in some sense complementary. The main contributions to
the quantities involved in the exchange only virial condi-
tion arise from the internal region of the atoms whereas
the highest energy eigenvalue is governed by the outer
region. By including these two conditions in the energy
functional we observed a better and more stable conver-
gence in the free parameters as compared to an uncon-
strained minimization of hHi. With the basis set used
here both conditions are satisﬁed within one part in 10−6
hartree.

The method can be generalized straightforwardly to
deal with a Multi Conﬁguration expansion. The starting
trial wave function is written as a linear combination of m
single conﬁguration wave functions with the total orbital
angular momentum and spin of the state under study.
The hamiltonian is diagonalized in this set. The orbitals
required to build the diﬀerent Slater determinants are ob-
tained as the eigenfunctions of the single particle eﬀective
potential containing several free parameters. The total
energy is minimized with respect to those parameters as
before. This more general trial wave function will provide
not only a better description of the lowest energy state of
a given symmetry but also a variational approximation to
the excited states because of the Hylleraas-Undheim the-
orem which states that the eigenvalues constitute upper
bounds to the ﬁrst m bound states. These type of wave
functions have been recently used along with a correla-
tion factor of Jastrow type to study some excited states of
the beryllium atom of and its isoelectronic series [30, 31].

III. RESULTS

In Table I the results obtained by using diﬀerent pa-
rameterizations of the eﬀective potential are analyzed.
We show the values for the Ne atom which is representa-
tive for the systems studied here. We compare with the
numerical optimized eﬀective potential results of Refs.
[12] and [32] and with the ﬁnite-basis set expansion of
the eﬀective potential of Refs. [19, 22]. The approximate
values of reference [9] are also reported. The HF results
are taken from [33] and are the benchmark values for the
total energy obtained from the OEP method. We also
report the exchange energy, Ex, and the eigenvalues ǫnl
and ǫHF
nl . The notation used for the parameterization is
(0n0, 1n1, 2n2, . . .) where np is the number of functions of
the type e−βk,prrp/r used in the expansion of the eﬀective
potential 2.

The best results are obtained with the (02, 12, 22) pa-
rameterization, and this is the one used for the rest of
the atoms. It can be seen that the value of the total en-
ergy does not depend substantially on the basis set, but
this is not the case of the other quantities. The use of
bigger basis set sizes for the eﬀective potential does not
improve noticeably the energy for the atoms Li to Ar and
it increases the computational eﬀort. However for heav-
ier atoms we have numerically checked that the rate of
convergence can be substantially improved by including
higher powers of r in the parameterization of the eﬀective
potential.

The best results of this work improve previous ones
obtained within the optimized eﬀective potential scheme
and it is only 0.57 mhartree above the Hartree-Fock
result. The expectation values ǫHF
obtained with the
λ
OEP orbitals are in a very good agreement with the cor-
responding single particle energies obtained within the
Hartree-Fock framework. This is because of the fact,
pointed out previously [9], that the single particle wave
functions calculated from the OEP method are a good
approximation to the Hartree-Fock orbitals.

The ground state and exchange energies of the atoms
Li to Ar as well as the single–particle expectation val-
ues, ǫHF
nl , and the single–particle OEP eigenvalues, ǫnl,
are reported in tables II and III. All of these quantities
are compared with those obtained within the HF frame-
work and with the numerical optimized eﬀective poten-
tial results of reference [32]. Within the Hartree-Fock
framework the two quantities ǫHF
nl and ǫnl are the same
so that we do not list them separately. For all the atoms
the (02, 12, 22) parameterization for the eﬀective poten-
tial has been used.

As can be noted there is an appreciable improvement
of the results, especially for the lightest atoms, which can
be more easily seen in Figure 1 where we plot the relative
error (in %) of our ground state energy with respect to
the HF one as compared to the relative error for the nu-
merical solution. In the present work the relative error is
nearly constant for all the atoms considered. In principle
one should expect a better energy coming from the nu-
merical solution than from the parametrized one as the
used in this work.

Previous works have also reported energies calculated
from a parametrized solution that are below the numer-
ical solution [19, 22]. The reason for the better per-
formance of the parametrized solution may be due to
numerical inaccuracies in the numerical solution of the
OEP equations due to the rather involved procedure of
its solution. In an attempt to elucidate this fact we have
carried out the following calculation. Starting from the
tabulation of Aashamar et al. [32] we have built a pa-
rameterized potential of (02, 12, 22) type by ﬁtting the
numerical values to that functional form. Then the ﬁt-
ted potential has been used in our code to determine the
best orbitals within the eﬀective potential approach of
this work without changing the ﬁtted potential. Here
we show the results for the Ne atom, which are repre-

The diﬀerence between the numerical OEP energy and
the result obtained here (−128.5465) is more accused.
This discrepancy is due to the diﬀerences in the eﬀective
potential. In Figure 2 we plot the eﬀective potential for
the Ne atom and the diﬀerences with the numerical re-
sults of [32]. The results for Ne are representative for
the rest of the atoms considered here. Notice that the
diﬀerences are multiplied by 10 to better see them in the

performance of the parameterized potential which allows
one to work analytically.

In Figure 3 we plot, the function Vp(r) obtained form

the eﬀective potential as (see Eq. 2)

Vp(r) =

rVe(r) + Z − N + 1
(N − 1)

(8)

We compare the best optimized eﬀective potential ob-
tained in this work with the numerical result calculated
form the tabulated values of Ref. [32], the ﬁtted potential
is included for the shake of completeness.

Although the eﬀective potential in the numerical ap-
proach and the parameterized solution of this work is
very similar, see Figure 1, the diﬀerences for Vp(r) be-
come apparent. The main discrepancies are for r >
∼ 1.5
au, with a faster decay to zero of the parameterized so-
lution. The magnitude of this part of the eﬀective po-
tential is smaller than the total potential. Therefore,
the discrepancies between the parametrized and numer-
ical solutions are not very accused, in this case ∼ 0.001
mhartree.

It is worth mentioning here that for Be, Ne, Mg and
Ar atoms more accurate numerical results for highest
occupied single particle eigenvalues have been reported,
[5, 12], but the total energy is very similar to that of
reference [32].

To illustrate the performance of the Optimized Eﬀec-
tive Potential with a multiconﬁgurational trial wave func-

tion we have applied it to a simple case. In Table IV we
study the ground and the ﬁrst 1P excited state of the
beryllium atom using a two conﬁguration wave function
in both cases. We compare our results with the corre-
sponding Multi Conﬁguration Hartree Fock ones [1, 34]
for the same states and conﬁgurations. For the ground
state, where the 2s-2p near degeneracy plays an impor-
tant role, we have expanded the wave function in terms of
the conﬁgurations 1s22s2 and 1s22p2. We have also stud-
ied the 1P state arising from the 1s22s2p conﬁguration
by considering the mixing with the 1s22p3d one.

Thus for the ground state, the trial wave function is

written as

|Ψi = c1|1s22s2;1 Si + c2|1s22p2;1 Si

(9)

and for the 1s22s2p 1P state the wave function is

|Ψi = d1|1s22s2p;1 P i + d2|1s22p3d;1 P i

(10)

In Table IV we show the values for the energy and for
the coeﬃcients ck and dk obtain ed with the OEP method
as compared with the corresponding MCHF ones [34]. It
is apparent the good agreement between the two sets
of results for both states that illustrates that the OEP
method not only provides a good value for the energy
but also an adequate weight for any of the conﬁgurations
involved in the corresponding state. For this case the

optimized eﬀective potential method with multi conﬁgu-
ration trial wave function compares with the MCHF at
the same level as the OEP method with the Hartree-Fock.
More complex wave functions using a larger number of
conﬁgurations have been used to study these and some
other excited states of this atom and its isoelectronic se-
ries [30, 31]. In those works, not fully optimized multi
conﬁguration wave function were used to build up more
accurate explicitly correlated wave functions of Jastrow
type.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The optimized eﬀective potential with parameterized
potential has been used to study the ground state of
the atoms from Li to Ar. Parameterized orbitals have
been used to solve the corresponding single particle

Schr¨odinger equation. The virial relation of Ghosh and
Parr and Levy and Perdew involving the exchange energy
and the exchange potential and a condition for the high-
est energy occupied orbital of Krieger, Li and Iafrate have
been imposed. These are two analytically known condi-
tions that the exact solution of the OEP equations must

constrained search of the optimum parameters is carried
out. As a result for the minimum both of them hold
within 10−6 hartree and the minimum energy is not sub-
stantially diﬀerent to that obtained in an unconstrained
minimization. The tail of the eﬀective potential is ex-
pected to be better reproduced by imposing the homo-
condition.

The method has been generalized to work with multi
conﬁguration wave functions as in the Multi Conﬁgu-
ration Hartree Fock method. This Multi Conﬁguration
OEP method provides results very close to those obtained
by using Multi Conﬁguration Hartree Fock (MCHF).

An analysis on the convergence on the parameteriza-
tion of the eﬀective potential is carried out. The results
obtained are very close to the Hartree-Fock self consis-
tent energies, eigenvalues and exchange energies improv-
ing previous optimized eﬀective potential calculations.
Results for several bound states of the beryllium atom
by using multi conﬁguration wave functions have been
reported.

We report an experimental investigation of momentum diﬀusion in the δ-function kicked rotor
where time symmetry is broken by a two-period kicking cycle and spatial symmetry by an alternating
linear potential. The momentum diﬀusion constant is thus modiﬁed by kick-to-kick correlations
which show a momentum dependence. We exploit this, and a technique involving a moving optical
potential, to create an asymmetry in the momentum diﬀusion that is due entirely to the chaotic
dynamics.

Classical systems with chaotic dynamics can exhibit
very diﬀerent behavior in the quantum limit. One such
system that has been frequently studied is the delta-
kicked rotor (DKR), modeled using laser-cooled atoms
in a pulsed periodic optical potential. Purely quantum
mechanical phenomena such as dynamical localization [1]
(the quantum suppression of classical momentum diﬀu-
sion), quantum resonances [2] (ballistic rather than dif-
fusive energy growth) have been observed. Asymmetry
in the DKR has been produced via accelerator modes [3]
where the maximum momentum is transferred in each
pulse to coherently impart a large amount of momentum
to a particle.

Recently DKR systems where the timing of the kicks is
subject to change, either by timing noise [4] or by using a
two-period cycle of kicks with small [5] or large [6] devi-
ation from period one have been studied. The two cases
are interesting to compare in that timing noise was found
to destroy classical correlations that give rise to ﬂuctu-
ations in the diﬀusion rate, whereas for the two-period
cycle the classical correlations acquire a momentum de-
pendence. For the large deviations from period 1 (the 2δ
kicked rotor) new families of correlations were shown to
exist and veriﬁed experimentally.

In this paper we report an experimental realisation of
the kicked rotor with broken time and space symmetry
that was described theoretically in [5]. We used cold
atoms in a pulsed optical lattice to model the delta kicked
rotor with a two-period kicking cycle to break time sym-
metry. We use an optical lattice that is moving with con-
stant velocity in the laboratory frame in order to probe
the momentum dependence of the momentum diﬀusion
rate in this case. We then use an accelerating optical lat-
tice to additionally break spatial symmetry. This proof-
of-principle experiment is, we believe, the ﬁrst demon-
stration of an asymmetric momentum diﬀusion that is
the result of purely chaotic dynamics and does not rely
on speciﬁc structures in phase space.

An optical lattice formed by two counter-propagating
laser beams may be used to trap laser-cooled atoms in
a one-dimensional periodic potential [7, 8], the Hamilto-

nian for which is

H =

+ V0 cos(2kLx)

(1)

p2
2M

where M is the mass of the atom, kL = 2π/λ the laser
wavevector and V0 the potential depth. If the optical lat-
tice is applied as a series of short (δ-function) pulses with
period T , then we may compare this with the Hamilto-
nian for the δ-kicked rotor as written in the usual dimen-
sionless form:

H =

+ K cos(φ)

δ(τ − n)

where K is the stochasticity parameter which describes
the strength of the kick. Here ρ = 2T kLp/M is a scaled
momentum, φ = 2kLx a scaled position, τ = t/T a
scaled time and H = 8ωRT 2H/¯h the scaled Hamilto-
nian. The commutation relation [φ, ρ] = i8ωRT gives the
scaled unit of system action or eﬀective Planck constant
¯heff = 8ωRT (ωR the recoil frequency) which may be
controlled through the period of the pulses. The dynam-
ics of the kicked rotor have been well studied, particularly
through the use of cold atoms in pulsed optical lattices
[9]. One important feature is the time-dependence of the
momentum which grows diﬀusively up to an ¯heff depen-
−2
dent time, t∗ ∝ ¯h
eff , the quantum break time, before
saturating. At times t < t∗ to lowest order the diﬀusion
constant, D ∝ K 2. Corrections to this arise from cor-
relations between kicks which appear as Bessel functions
[10]:

the eﬀects of which have been observed as anomalous
momentum diﬀusion for particular values of K [11].

In [5] it was shown that for the δ-kicked rotor where
time symmetry is broken by a two-period kicking cycle
of periods T (1 + b) : T (1 − b) where b < 1, then for short
times these correlations give rise to a momentum depen-
dent diﬀusion constant D(K, ρ, b) ≃ D0 − C(2, ρ), where
D0 ≃ K 2[1/2 − J1(K)2] and C(2, ρ) = K 2J2(K) cos(2ρb)

linewidths (natural linewidth Γ = 2π× 5.22 MHz) to the
low frequency side of the D2 cooling transition in cesium,
which is suﬃcient for eﬀects due to spontaneous emission
to be neglected. This is split into two equal intensity
beams using a half-wave plate and polarizing beam split-
ter (HWP1 and PBS in ﬁgure 1) and each beam sent
through an AOM. The two AOMs are driven by separate
(phase-locked) radio-frequency synthesizers that are con-
trolled by separate fast radio-frequency switches but trig-
gered by the same arbitrary function generator that pro-
duces the kicks. After the kicking the cloud of cold atoms
is allowed to expand ballistically for up to 20 ms before
a pair of counter-propagating near-resonant laser beams
are switched on and the ﬂuorescence from the atoms im-
aged on a CCD camera. From the spatial distribution of
the ﬂuorescence it is then possible to extract the momen-
tum distribution. Using this apparatus we have checked
that the dynamical localization which is characteristic
of quantum chaos can be observed (for regularly spaced
kicks, i.e. b = 0 in the above) as a growth in momentum
for a ﬁnite number of kicks and a change to an exponen-
tial momentum distribution.

The momentum dependence of the diﬀusion constant
may be probed by using a sample of cold atoms with a
non-zero mean initial momentum, such as may be pre-
pared by cooling in an optical molasses in the presence
of a non-zero magnetic ﬁeld [15]. A disadvantage of this
technique is that the wings of the atomic distribution
may easily extend beyond the ﬁeld of view of the CCD
camera for relatively low momentum. Instead we have
used a moving optical lattice formed by laser beams with
a controlled frequency diﬀerence to make the kicking po-
tential, so that atoms which are stationary in the lab-
oratory frame (remain in the center of the CCD pic-
ture) have a non-zero momentum in the rest frame of
the optical potential. This is achieved by driving the
AOMs at frequencies f ± ∆f as shown in ﬁgure 1, such
that the atomic momentum in the rest frame of lattice is
ρL = mλ2∆f ¯heff /4π¯h. Using this technique the mean
momentum in the lattice frame, ρL, may be varied over
a large range in order to sample several periods of the
oscillation of the diﬀusion constant without the beams
becoming signiﬁcantly misaligned from the cloud of cold
atoms.

We have investigated several values of the parameters
K and ¯heff , but present here those from conditions sim-
ilar to those in [5], that is K = 3.3 (10% error arising
manily from the measurement of the beam intensity) and
¯heff = 1 for values of b =1/16 and 1/32. This value of
K was chosen as it corresponnds to the ﬁrst maximum of
the Bessel function J2(K), and hence may be expected
to produce the clearest experimental signature, i.e. the
largest amplitude oscillations in momentum asymmetry.
Although for the Standard Map phase space is not com-
pletely chaotic for K = 3.3, the introduction of the pa-
rameter b ensures no stable structures remain.

FIG. 1: Diagram of apparatus. The half-wave plate HWP1
and polarizing beam splitter PBS are used to create two equal
intensity beams which are shifted in frequency by f ± ∆f by
the AOMs. HWP2 is used to make the polarizations of the
two beams parallel.

arising from correlations between kick number i and kick
number i + 2. This correction has a ﬁnite lifetime, de-
noted the ratchet time, trat in [5], which depends on the
parameter b as trat ∼ 1/Db2. This timescale is diﬀer-
ent from, and may be controlled independently of, the
break time, which lead to the main conclusion of [12] that
the clearest experimental signature of this phenomenon
would require t∗/trat ∼ Db/¯heff ∼ 1.

By including a linear term of alternating sign in the
kicking potential Jonckheere et al. also showed that the
C(2, ρ) term may be made locally asymmetric around
ρ=0, as C(2, ρ) → K 2J2(K) cos(2ρb − A) where A is
the (scaled) gradient of the linear “rocking” term, even
for parameters where, unlike [13] there are no signiﬁcant
stable structures remaining. It was suggested that this
system may be used to observe an asymmetry in the mo-
mentum diﬀusion or to produce a chaotic momentum ﬁl-
tering. An analysis of the Floquet states of this perturbed
period kicked rotor may be found in [14].

In our experiment we realize a model of the δ-kicked
rotor using laser-cooled cesium atoms in a far-oﬀ reso-
nant pulsed optical lattice. The lattice is formed by two
horizontal counter-propagating laser beams, 1/e radius
(0.95±0.05 mm), with parallel linear polarizations (see
ﬁgure 1) which produces a spatial variation of the AC
Stark shift that is proportional to the local intensity, and
hence sinusoidal.

The pulses are produced by rapidly switching the drive
voltage to the acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) accord-
ing to a pre-deﬁned sequence. The time between the
kicks may be altered in order to produce the two-period
“chirped” kicking cycle described above. The experi-
ment proceeds as follows. Cesium atoms are trapped
and cooled in a standard six-beam magneto-optic trap
(MOT) before further cooling in an optical molasses to
an rms scaled momentum width of σρ ≃ 4. The mo-
lasses light is turned oﬀ using an AOM and the periodic
“kicking” potential applied. The beams for the kicking
potential are derived from a Ti:Sapphire laser with an
output power of 1 W at 852 nm, detuned typically 2000

aligned from the cold atoms as the AOM beam deﬂection
increases with ∆f , or may be an eﬀect of the ﬁnite width
of the pulses. For tp = 296 ns the momentum boundary
occurs at ρb = 65π, and as shown in [17] the maximum
asymmetry due to the ﬁnite pulse width occurs at ap-
proximately ρL = ρb
2 , and in the negative sense. We
should also note a dc oﬀset to the data, which we believe
arises from an initial misalignment of the laser beams,
or from a systematic error in locating the centre of mass.
The signature of the kick-to-kick correlations, however, is
the ac signal which is clearly shown in both sets fo data.
To break spatial symmetry a linear ‘rocking’ term of
alternating sign is included by accelerating the optical
lattice [18]. This is done by modulating the frequency
of one of the laser beams in a linear manner using a
second (phase-locked) arbitrary function generator by an
amount ±δf in the time of the kick period T . In the ac-
celerating frame an inertial term appears in the Hamil-
tonian

where the primes indicate variables in the accelerating
frame. If, as before, this is now recast into dimensionless
form we ﬁnd that (dropping the primes for convenience)

(cid:19) X

where the dimensionless potential gradient is related to
the magnitude of the frequency modulation (acceleration
of the lattice) by A = 2πtpδf for ﬁnite pulses of width tp.
Accelerating the potential thus provides a simple way of
controlling the magnitude of A and hence controlling the
phase shift of the momentum-dependent diﬀusion con-
stant in order to make it locally asymmetric around zero
momentum.

For the accelerating lattice experiment the parameters
were K = 2.6, T = 9.47 µs, (so ¯heff = 1,) tp = 296 ns and
b = 1/16. The number of kicks was 120. As the max-
imum frequency modulation amplitude allowed by the
radio-frequency synthesizers was ±1.25 MHz this limits
the range of A achievable to ±3π/4. In order to observe
one complete oscillation of the momentum diﬀusion con-
stant, for some experiments an additional constant fre-
quency oﬀset was introduced between the laser beams
such that in the rest frame of the lattice the mean atomic
momentum was ρL = 8π. The asymmetry of the momen-
tum distribution (calculated as above) was measured as
a function of the amplitude of the frequency modulation
of the laser beam, δf , for both ρL = 0 and ρL = 8π and
plotted as a function of (2ρLb − A)/π. Results are shown
in ﬁgure 3 and can be seen to be sinusoidal (proportional
to the local gradient of the diﬀusion constant) with a
period of 2π as expected from the theory.

Examples of the momentum distributions obtained
from this experiment are shown in ﬁgure 4. All three

lattice frame for K = 3.3, ¯hef f = 1, b = 1/32 (ﬁlled squares)
and b = 1/16 (open triangles). The dotted lines are sinusoidal
with period π/b and are intended as a guide only.

For these experiments the period of the kicks is T =
9.47 µs and pulses are square with duration typically tp =
296 ns (tp/T = 1/32 ≤ b), which is suﬃcient for there
to be no substantial eﬀects on the diﬀusion constant due
to the ﬁnite temporal width of the kicks in the region of
ρL = 0 [16] (for larger ρL these eﬀects become important
and start to aﬀect the data). An investigation of the
eﬀects on the asymmetry of momentum diﬀusion arising
the ﬁnite width of the kicks was presented in [17].

We characterise the asymmetry of the momentum dis-
tribution after the kicks by the ﬁrst moment of the dis-
N (ρ)dρ, and plot this as a
tribution, hρi =
function of ρL as shown in ﬁgure 2. We observe that the
R
asymmetry for each experiment oscillates with a period
π/b in agreement with the theory of [5], and shown by
the dashed lines which are ∝ sin(32πρL) (top panel of ﬁg-
ure 2) and ∝ sin(16πρL) (lower panel). The data appears
to deviate from this line at higher values of ρL ≃ 32π
which may be due either to the beams becoming mis-

large positive asymmetry and A = +π/2 a large negative
asymmetry.

In conclusion we have shown that by breaking time and
space symmetry in the delta-kicked rotor correlations be-
tween kicks give rise to a momentum-dependent diﬀusion
rate. We have exploited this in order to demonstrate ex-
perimentally a system that exhibits an asymmetric mo-
mentum diﬀusion due only to chaotic dynamics, in con-
trast to previous work that relies on speciﬁc features or
structures in phase space.

cussions and EPSRC and UCL for ﬁnancial support.

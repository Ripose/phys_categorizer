We produce large numbers of low-energy ions by photoionization of laser-cooled atoms inside a
surface-electrode-based Paul trap. The isotope-selective trap loading rate of 4 × 105 Yb+ ions/s
exceeds that attained by photoionization (electron impact ionization) of an atomic beam by four
(six) orders of magnitude. Traps as shallow as 0.13 eV are easily loaded with this technique. The ions
are conﬁned in the same spatial region as the laser-cooled atoms, which will allow the experimental
investigation of interactions between cold ions and cold atoms or Bose-Einstein condensates.

Among many candidate systems for large-scale quan-
tum information processing, trapped ions currently of-
fer unmatched coherence and control properties [1]. The
basic building blocks of a processor, such as quantum
gates [2], subspaces with reduced decoherence [3], quan-
tum teleportation [4, 5], and entanglement of up to eight
ions [6, 7] have already been demonstrated. Nevertheless,
since a logical qubit will likely have to be encoded simul-
taneously in several ions for error correction [8, 9], even
a few-qubit system will require substantially more com-
plex trap structures than currently in use. Versatile trap-
ping geometries can be realized with surface-electrode
Paul traps, where electrodes residing on a surface create
three-dimensional conﬁning potentials above it [10]. In
contrast to three-dimensional traps [11, 12, 13], such sur-
face traps can be patterened using standard lithographic
techniques, and allow increased optical access to the ions
and real-time control over their position in all directions.
While the prospect of scalable quantum computing
has been the main motivation for developing surface-
electrode traps, it is likely that this emerging technology
will have a number of other important, and perhaps more
immediate, applications. Porras and Cirac have proposed
using dense lattices of ion traps, where neighboring ions
interact via the Coulomb force, for quantum simulation
[14]. A lattice, with a larger period to avoid ion-ion inter-
actions altogether, could allow the parallel operation of
many single-ion optical clocks [15], thereby signiﬁcantly
boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. The increased optical
access provided by planar traps could be used to cou-
ple a linear array of ion traps to an optical resonator and
eﬃciently map the stored quantum information onto pho-
tons [16]. Since the surface-electrode arrangement allows
one to move the trap minimum freely in all directions,
ions can be easily embedded in an ensemble of cold neu-
tral atoms for investigations of cold ion-atom collisions
[17], charge transport [18], or even the interaction of a
single ion with a Bose-Einstein condensate [19].

Compared to standard Paul traps [11, 12, 13], the
open geometry of surface-electrode traps restricts the

trap depth and increases the susceptibility to stray elec-
tric ﬁelds, making trap loading and compensation more
diﬃcult. Nevertheless, successful loading from a ther-
mal atomic beam has recently been demonstrated using
photoionization [20] or electron-impact ionization aided
by buﬀer gas cooling [21]. The former [22, 23] is su-
perior in that it provides faster, isotope-selective load-
ing [20, 24, 25, 26]. However, the loading rate and eﬃ-
ciency remain relatively low, and charge exchange colli-
sions make it diﬃcult to load pure samples of rare iso-
topes [25].

In this Letter, we demonstrate that large numbers of
low-energy ions can be produced by photoionization of a
laser-cooled, isotopically pure atomic sample, providing
a robust and virtually fail-safe technique to load shallow
or initially poorly compensated surface ion traps. We
achieve a loading rate of 4 × 105 Yb ions per second into
a U0 = 0.4 eV deep printed-circuit ion trap, several or-
ders of magnitude larger than with any other method
demonstrated so far, and have directly loaded traps as

trap height above the surface. With a typical value of
Vc/Vo = −0.63, the RF node is located 3.6(1) mm above
from the surface. For Vo = 540 V applied to the outer
electrodes, at an RF frequency of 850 kHz the secular
trap potential has a predicted depth of U0 = 0.16 eV
(Fig.2) and a measured secular frequency of 60 kHz . The
trap can be deepened by applying a static negative bias
voltage Vdc to all RF electrodes [21], Fig.2, and unbiased
once the ions are loaded. Using Vdc = 0.5 V we were
able to load traps at RF voltages as low as Vo = 250 V,
corresponding to U0=0.13 eV.

tion light is derived from near-UV external-cavity diode

magneto-optical trap (MOT) using the 1S0 → 1P1 tran-
sition at 399 nm [27]. A master-slave laser system con-
sisting of an external-cavity grating laser and an in-
jected slave laser using violet laser diodes (Nichia Corp.
NDHV310ACAE1) delivers 10 mW in three pairs of 1.7
mm beams. The MOT, located 4 mm above the sub-
strate, is loaded from an atomic beam produced by a
resistively heated oven placed 8 cm from the trapping
region. Typically 5 × 105 Yb atoms are loaded into the
MOT with a lifetime of 300 ms at an estimated temper-
ature of a few mK.

Photoionization from the excited 1P1 state populated
during laser cooling is accomplished using either the ion
cooling laser at 370 nm with a power of 750 µW and in-
tensity of 850 mW/cm2, or a focused UV light-emitting
diode (UV LED, Nichia Corp. NCCU001, emission at
(385±10) nm) with a power of 8.7 mW and intensity of
125 mW/cm2 at the MOT position. The eﬃciency of ion-
ization is manifest as a 30% decrease in MOT atom num-
ber due to an increase in the MOT decay rate constant
by Γ = 0.3 s−1. The generated ions are also detected di-
rectly with a Burle Magnum 5901 Channeltron avalanche
detector located 4 cm above the MOT. The UV-light in-
duced MOT loss depends linearly on UV laser intensity
(Fig.3), indicating that the ionization process involves a
single 370 nm photon. We have also conﬁrmed that the
dominant ionization proceeds from the 1P1 state: when
we apply on/oﬀ modulation to both the 399 nm MOT
light and the 370 nm UV light out of phase, such that the
UV light interacts only with ground-state atoms, we ob-
serve more than 13-fold decrease in ionization compared
to in-phase modulation. From the observed loss rate in
combination with an estimated saturation s = 0.6 − 2
of the 1S0 →1P1 MOT transition, we determine a cross
section σ = 4 × 10−18cm2 for ionization of 174Yb with
370 nm light from the excited 1P1 state. We estimate
that this value is accurate to a factor of two, due to un-
certainties in the 1P1 population.

The photoionization typically produces 4 × 105 cold
ions per second near the minimum of the pseudopoten-
tial. Trapped-ion detection with the Channeltron pro-
vides rapid readout, making it particularly useful for ob-

ter electrodes together with a DC bias of -1.25 V applied to all

shallow as U0 = 0.13 eV. The trapping eﬃciency for the
generated low-energy ions is of order unity. We also re-
alize the ﬁrst system where ions are conﬁned in the same
spatial region as laser-cooled atoms, allowing for future
experimental studies of cold ion-atom collisions.

Eﬃcient photoionization of Yb atoms is accomplished
with a single photon from the excited 1P1 state that is
populated during laser cooling, and that lies 3.11 eV,
corresponding to a 394 nm photon, below the ionization
continuum. Due to momentum and energy conservation,
most of the ionization photon’s excess energy is trans-
ferred to the electron. Therefore, when we ionize atoms
at rest even with 3.36 eV (369 nm) photons – the ion
cooling light – the calculated kinetic energy of the ions
amounts to only 8 mK (0.7 µeV). Every ion generated
inside the trap should therefore be captured, and we eas-
ily observe ion trapping even without subsequent laser
cooling.

The ion trap is a commercial printed circuit on a
vacuum-compatible substrate (Rogers 4350) with low ra-
diofrequency (RF) loss. The three 1 mm-wide, 17.5 µm-
thick copper RF electrodes are spaced by 1 mm wide
slits (Fig.1), whose inner surfaces are metallized to avoid
charge buildup on dielectric surfaces. The two outer RF
electrodes are electrically connected. Twelve dc elec-
trodes placed outside the RF electrodes provide trap-
ping in the axial direction, and permit cancellation of
stray electric ﬁelds. In addition, the RF electrodes can
be dc-biased to apply a vertical electric ﬁeld. All dielec-
tric surfaces outside the dc electrodes have been removed
with the exception of a 500 µm strip supporting the dc
electrodes.

The ratio between the RF voltages Vc (applied to the
center electrode) and Vo (outer electrode) determines the

serving fast trap loading or searching for an initial sig-
nal with a poorly compensated trap. Since the detector
electric ﬁeld overwhelms the pseudopotential, we turn on
the Channeltron in 1 µs using a Pockels cell driver which
is fast compared to the 3.3 µs ﬂight time of the ions.
The Channeltron signal is calibrated against ﬂuorescence
from a known number of ions, as described below.

We measure ion loading rates by varying the time be-
tween turning on the trap and switching on the detector,
which empties the trap. Given the brightness of our cold-
ion source, ion trapping is easily accomplished even with-
out laser cooling of the ions. Fig.4 shows the loading rate
for photoionization of atoms from the MOT and from the
atomic beam for the trap potential of depth of U0=0.4
eV shown in Figure2. The loading rate from the MOT,

4 × 105 ions/s, is three orders of magnitude higher than
that from the beam alone, compared to a ratio of only
four in the ion production rates measured without trap.
Thus ions that were produced from laser-cooled atoms in
a magneto-optical trap are 200 times more likely to be
trapped than ions produced from the atomic beam. We
ascribe this diﬀerence to the much higher MOT atomic
density near the ion-trap minimum and to the lower en-
ergy of the produced ions. As the MOT is isotopically
pure, our observations of a 103 loading rate ratio between
MOT and atomic beam imply an additional achievable
factor of 103 in isotope selectivity beyond the 370:1 iso-
tope selectivity resulting from spectrally selective pho-
toionization in an atomic beam [25].

From comparisons of electron-impact ionization load-
ing and atomic-beam photoionization loading performed
by other groups [24, 25], we conclude that our loading
rate is six to seven orders of magnitude higher than that
achieved with traditional electron-impact ionization and
four orders of magnitude higher than all previous results.
In addition, by comparing the typical observed loss rate
from the MOT (1.1×105 atoms/s) to the typical observed
loading rate (2.4 × 105 ions/s) under similar conditions,
we conclude that our trapping eﬃciency is comparable to
unity. We attribute the discrepancy in rates to calibra-
tion of the Channeltron ion detector and uncertainty in
the MOT population. This eﬃciency may prove an im-
portant advantage for suppressing anomalous ion heating
that has been linked to electrode exposure to the atomic
beam during the loading process [13]. The large loading
rate will also be beneﬁcial for applications that require a
large, isotopically pure sample, such as quantum simula-
tion in an ion lattice [14].

The loaded ions are cooled and observed via ﬂuores-
cence using an external-cavity grating laser.
[28]. To
reach the target wavelength of 369.525 nm with a 372
nm laser diode (Nichia) in a Littrow setup with a ﬁrst-
order grating reﬂectivity of 28%, we cool the diode to
temperatures between -10 and -20◦C in a moisture-tight
container. The laser provides an output power of 1.5 mW
and is continuously tunable over more than 10 GHz.

For laser cooling of Yb+, the laser is typically tuned
200 MHz below the 2S1/2 → 2P1/2 transition. An
external-cavity repumper laser operating at 935 nm is
also necessary to empty the long-lived 2D3/2 state on the
2D3/2 → 3D[3/2]1/2 transition [29]. The UV light scat-
tered by the ions is collected with an aspheric lens of
numerical aperture 0.40 placed inside the vacuum cham-
ber at a distance of 19 mm from the trap. The collected
light passes through an interference ﬁlter, and is evenly
split between a charge-coupled device camera and a pho-
tomultiplier. The maximum photomultiplier count rate is
5000 s−1 per ion. To calibrate the Channeltron detector,
we ﬁrst cool a small cloud of ions (approximately 100)
to below the crystallization temperature, as identiﬁed by
a sudden change in the ﬂuorescence [30]. By compar-
ing the resonance ﬂuorescence of the crystal to that of a
single trapped ion, we determine the absolute number of
ions loaded, and subsequently measure the Channeltron
signal for the same cloud.

The optical observation of the trapped ions allows us
to determine the trap position and optimize the overlap
with the MOT. We move the MOT laterally using mag-
netic bias coils and the ion trap vertically by changing
the amplitude ratio of the voltages applied to the two
RF electrodes. Fig.5 shows that for the optimal load-
ing position of the trap, the pseudopotential minimum
is located inside the neutral-atom cloud. We have thus
demonstrated the ﬁrst trapping of cold ions and neutral
atoms in the same spatial region, which will allow the
experimental investigation of cold ion-atom collisions.

In conclusion, we have realized a novel, simple and ro-
bust system to load large numbers of low-energy ions into
a versatile planar ion trap. Further trap miniaturization
while maintaining a large loading rate can be achieved
with a nested electrode design, where large outer elec-
trodes provide initial trapping, and a series of smaller in-
ner electrodes provides stronger conﬁnement as the ions
are transported towards the surface. This system pro-
vides the means to realize ion lattices for quantum simu-

lation [14], ionic quantum memory with optical readout
[16], many-ion optical clocks, or mixed ion-atom systems
for the investigation of cold collisions [17] and charge
transport [18].

Faddeev equations in conﬁguration space and integral form for three-atom scattering processes
are formulated allowing for additive and nonadditive forces. The explicit partial wave decomposition
is displayed. This formulation appears to be a valuable alternative to current approaches based on
hyperspherical harmonic expansion methods of the Schr¨odinger equation.

INTRODUCTION

The Faddeev scheme for three bodies is a very successful framework in nuclear physics and speciﬁcally in the 3-
nucleon system [1],[2]. Most of the calculations are performed in momentum space, which is naturally adapted to
nuclear forces derived from meson exchange diagrams. Also the coordinate space version of the Faddev equations in
diﬀerential form has been successfully used, especially for the three-nucleon bound states [3], but an integral equation
form of the Faddeev equation in conﬁguration space has not yet been developed in detail. To the best of our knowledge
this has not been done before, neither in the ﬁelds of nuclear nor atomic physics.

While in nuclear physics there is only one 2-body bound state, the deuteron, diatomic molecules have numerous
vibrational and rotational levels. This poses quite a numerical challenge, especially in 3-atom scattering processes. A
great deal of work has been done in this ﬁeld using hyperspherical harmonic expansion methods, [10],[11]. Here and
below we quote only a few recent papers. It is the purpose of this paper to describe an alternative approach using
the conﬁguration space Faddeev equations in integral form. We have chosen that scheme since over the years a highly
eﬃcient numerical technique in coordinate space has been developed by one of us [4] for solving 2-body scattering and
bound state problems. This method is based on spectral expansion techniques in terms of Chebyshev polynomialsi
denoted as S-IEM in [4]. As we shall indicate these methods are ideally suited to the integral Faddeev scheme for 3
atoms. It is hoped that this technique will result in an accuracy for the ﬁnal 3-body results that is higher than what
is currently achieved in nuclear physics calculations in momentum space ( about 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures). Needless to
say there exist a great demand for theoretical support for various kinds of 3-atom processes: 3-atom recombination
processes [12], collisional cooling of co-trapped atomic and molecular ions by ultracold atoms[14],[13],[18],[19], quantum
dynamics of ultra cold atom-diatom collisions [15]. Three-atom potential surfaces have been developed, for instance
for H3[16] or for Li3 [17].

In section II we provide a brief derivation of the form of Faddeev equations we want to use. The coordinate space
representation expressed in terms of vectors is subsequently set up in section III, while its partial wave representation
is worked out in section IV. Because of the complexity of the resulting expressions for general orbital angular momenta
a separate section V is devoted to an overall s-wave reduction, since this case provides a more transparent insight into
the structure of the equations. Technical details for the partial wave decomposition are deferred to the Appendices.
We delegate a numerical feasibility study to a forthcoming paper, but we nevertheless add some remarks on that issue
in section VI. Finally in section VII we provide a summary and conclusions.

II. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Let us regard a system of three distinguishable atoms, which interact by 2-and 3- atom forces. Though apparently
most often the full potential surface for 3 atoms is used ab initio, we prefer to separate out the 2-atom forces from the
full potential surface and treat the remainder as a genuine 3-atom force. Thus we denote the total potential energy
between 3 atoms by

= i) and V4 is the genuine 3- atom force.
where the 2- atom forces are conveniently denoted by Vi ≡
Instead of introducing four Faddeev components corresponding to the four contributions to the potential we split

Vjk (with j, k

V = V1 + V2 + V3 + V4

(1)

the 3- atom force into 3 parts, which are then combined with the three 2-atom forces, as follows. We introduce the
notation

V4 = V (1)

4 + V (2)

4 + V (3)

where V (i)
rical in the interchange of atoms j, k

= i. In detail

where the argument 123 stands for the space coordinate vectors of the 3 atoms. Thus the two terms in the ﬁrst row
are symmetrical and antisymmetrical, respectively, under exchange of atoms 2 and 3 and similarly for the two terms
in next two rows. We group the potential into three terms Vi and V (i)
in the 3-atom Schr¨odinger equation (SE),
which then can be written as

In the present paper we describe a scattering process where one atom is incident on a molecular bound state of
the other two atoms. We can number the three atoms such that the target molecule is formed out of atoms 2 and 3.
Thus the initial channel state is

composed of the 2-atom bound state
~q0 >1 of relative motion of atom 1 and the molecule (2,3). That channel state obeys

where where G0 is the free 3-atom propagator, G0 = (E + iε
is no solution to the left hand side of Eq.(4) alone which is regular at the origin and purely outgoing. The above

The new ingredient, the 2- atom t-operators ti embedded into the 3-body space, with i = 1, 2, 3, obey the Lippmann
Schwinger equation(LSE)

ti = Vi + ViG0ti

This generalization is natural, since the Faddeev equations contain a two-atom potential Vi separately in each

arrangement i. A short description of the related two-body operator τ (r, r′) and the amplitude T (r) is as follows:

The Lippmann Schwinger equation for the solution of the two-body SE is ψ = φ + g0V ψ, where g0 is the Green’s
H02)−1, H02 is the two-body kinetic energy operator, V the potential, and φ is the incident plane
function (E2 + iε
wave. The product V (r) ψ(r) is denoted by T (r), and is expressed in terms of an integral involving the τ operator as

V g0)−1V = τ , which is equivalent to Eq.
By manipulating operator identities ( 10) and (11) one can show that (1
(13), with the diﬀerence that g0 contains only the kinetic energy for the relative motion of two particles, while G0
also includes the kinetic energy for the other particle, and further, E2 is the two-body energy, while E is the total
three-body energy. The connection between ti and the two-body t
matrix τ is established in section III, see Eqs (56)
and (57).

The kernel pieces in Eqs.(12) determine the asymptotic behavior of the wave function components ψi in the outgoing
channels. For the 3- atom break- up they can be read oﬀ from the expressions standing to the right of the free
propagator G0 [1] [8].

Thus if we deﬁne the three T-amplitudes as

ψ1 = φ1 + G0 T1
ψ2
ψ3

= G0 T2
= G0 T3

then we obtain for the Ti ’s the expressions

T1 = t1G0(T2 + T3) + (1 + t1G0)G0 V (1)

4 Ψ

and correspondingly for T2 and T3. The T - amplitudes are more useful than the wave function amplitudes because
from the T - amplitudes one can derive the asymptotic normalization of the wave functions and furthermore , most
importantly, the T ’s decrease to zero at large distances. Inserting Eqs.(15) into the right hand sides of Eq.(16) and
the ones for T2 and T3 one ﬁnds a set of 3 coupled equations

T1 = t1G0(T2 + T3) + (1 + t1G0) V (1)

This is the set of equations which are to be solved. A partial wave decomposition will be given in section IV.

Because of (8) the total break- up amplitude will be

from Eqs.(12) by rewriting the kernel parts such that Vi distorts the Green operators

IV. PARTIAL WAVE DECOMPOSITION

In view of the various vibration-rotational levels it is natural to decompose the integral equations for the various
T-amplitudes into partial waves. We exempliﬁy that step for the case of three indentical atoms, and choose therefore
Eqs.(75),(76),(77) . The scalar quantities τ as well as the single particle Green’s function g, both contained in Eqs.
(75),(76),(77) have the partial wave decomposition

two driving terms in the ﬁrst line of Eq(41) will be denoted by T 0,1 and T 0,2, respectively.

where the T 0,i are the driving terms and the K’s incorporate the T -amplitudes.

These are coupled equations among the T ’s, since Eqs (111),(119) and (120) contain sums over several T ’s. Once
the T-amplitudes in case of distinguishable particles are obtained we can use the Eqs. (26),(27),(28) to determine
the elastic and arrangement amplitudes as well as the complete break-up amplitude (20). In the case of identical
atoms one can not distinguish, of course, between elastic and arrangement amplitudes. Let us ﬁrst regard the elastic
amplitude given in Eq(43).

This concludes the display of the formalism. The cases for two identical atoms out of the three or three distin-
guishable atoms are somewhat more tedious to be worked out, but straightforward and are left to the interested
practioner.

V. THE S-WAVE EXPRESSIONS

For very low energy of the incoming atom and the molecule in its ground state one can restrict the treatment to
setting all orbital angular momenta to zero. Then the ﬁnal expressions simplify and allow an overview of the structure
of the integral equation to be solved and the quadrature expression for elastic scattering. Again we display only the
case of identical atoms. In this case the quantities Λ and h given in the Appendices both simplify to 1
4π and the
integral equation (121) composed of the parts(110), (118), (111),(119) and (120) now reads

VI. COMPUTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

The numerical solution of the integral equations for the T-amplitudes requires a large amount of computer time,
depending on the number of angular momenta that enter in the partial wave expansion, and also on the number
of mesh points that are needed for the discretization of the integration kernels, or equivalently, on the number of
mesh points needed for the discretization of the coordinates x and y. We expect to minimize the number of required
mesh points by using a recently developed spectral integral equation method (S-IEM) [4] for solving the two-body
Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation in conﬁguration space that is very economical in the number of mesh points
required for a given accuracy. This feature has now been demonstrated in several applications that are summarized in
[4]. For example [7], for the case of the binding energy of the He-He dimer which is very small, the calculation of the
bound state wave function has to be carried out to large distances. For a distance of 3000 a.u. the S-IEM required
only 200 mesh points to obtain an accuracy of three signiﬁcant ﬁgures for the binding energy, and with 320 mesh
points the accuracy increased to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures [7]. The method consists in dividing the radial interval into
partitions, each partition receiving a ﬁxed number of mesh points, expanding the unknown wave function into a series
of Chebyshev polynomials in each partition, and then solving for the coeﬃcients of the expansion. Such expansions
are by themselves very eﬃcient, and their accuracy properties are known. In addition, the size of the partitions is
made automatically small in the region where the wave function changes rapidly, and large where it changes slowly, a
feature that further contributes to the economy. An additional advantage of the spectral method is that conventional
interpolation methods can be avoided. In the Faddeev scheme the Jacobi coordinates in one arrangement have to
be translated into the corresponding coordinates in another arrangement. These translated points do not fall onto
the predetermined mesh of points in another arrangement, hence interpolations are usually required with methods
using ﬁxed mesh points. The spectral method avoids this problem, since the Chebyshev polynomials, being analytic
functions, can be evaluated at any prescribed positions, and hence provide the necessary translations.

The two-body τ - matrices play a large role in the calculation of the driving terms (110) ( 118) and the integration
kernels (111 ) ( 119) ( 120). Investigations in progress are showing that the S-IEM can also be applied to the evaluation
of the two-variable τ - matrices, and the partition structure of the radial intervals of the latter will then subsequently
determine the partition structure of the integration kernels. The number of mesh points for each of the two variables
in the τ -matrix is expected to be of the order of 50. The size of the matrices that represent the integration kernels
will have to be estimated, and depending on the outcome, iterative procedures may be required.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

18

The purpose of this paper is to lay out the theoretical formulation of the solution of the three-body Faddeev integral
equations in conﬁguration space, for the purpose of applying them to atomic physics situations. It is assumed that
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is valid and the three atoms are moving on one potential surface. The case
of a conical intersection is not treated but it appears conceivable that also such a case could be handled by using
coupled Faddeev equations, similar to the treatment of ∆ - excitations in a three-nucleon problem. We have chosen
a formulation of the Faddeev equations which turned out to be extremely useful in nuclear physics [1]. Instead of
working with wave function components we introduce break-up amplitudes Ti, which vanish at large distances and
fulﬁll a set of three coupled equations. In case of identical atoms only one equation is needed. That set of equations
is then displayed in a conﬁguration space vector representation and furtheron decomposed into partial waves. For
the sake of clarity this set of coupled equations is also presented assuming s- waves only. Once the T-amplitudes
are determined all physical matrix elements for elastic and inelastic atom -diatom scattering, for the arrangement
processes and the complete 3-atom break- up process are obtained by simple quadrature. The relevant expressions
are given in detailed form.

One reason for working in conﬁguration space is that the atom-atom two- and three-body potential surfaces are
given in that space. One objection commonly raised against performing three - body calculations in conﬁguration
space is that one needs many mesh points for the numerical implementation, because the wave functions have to be
calculated out to large distances in order to impose the asymptotic boundary conditions. We overcome this objection
for several reasons. One is, as already said, that we do not calculate wave functions, but rather T-amplitudes.
These functions are essentially the product of wave functions times potentials, and hence decay fast with distance in
contrast to wave functions, which oscillate at inﬁnity. Also, the asymptotic boundary conditions of the underlying
wave functions are automatically included, because the Faddeev integral equations contain the Greens functions which
lead to the appropriate asymptotic behavior. Another objection against working in conﬁguration space is that wave
functions, and so also T-amplitudes, can have a strongly oscillatory behavior, and hence many mesh points may be
required. We expect to overcome this objection by using a recently developed spectral method (S-IEM) for solving
the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation that is very economical in the number of mesh points required
for a given accuracy [4]. The economy in mesh points is crucial when solving the Faddeev integral or diﬀerential
equations, because the numerical complexity increases like the cube of the dimension of the ﬁnal matrix, and the size
of the dimension is proportional to the number of mesh points.

In summary in this paper we lay out in detail the partial wave expanded Faddeev equations for the T -amplitudes
in conﬁguration space and in integral form. These equations, although complicated, are not much more complicated
than the corresponding equations in momentum space, which have been successfully solved in the realm of nuclear
physics. In a future study we intend to solve the equations for a simple test case in order to study the numerical
feasibilty of the method.

The evaluation of h can be done using standard angular momentum algebra [5] [6],[8]. So we do not provide the

detailed steps but mention only some useful formula, which are needed and possibly not so commonly in use.

The dependence on the two vector directions in the shifted arguments for the spherical harmonics can be seperated

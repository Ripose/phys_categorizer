Abstract

≈

The excess electrons mobility µ has been measured recently in liquid mixtures of Kr and CH4

as a function of the electric ﬁeld up to E

104 V /cm and of the CH4 concentration x up to

x

10%, at temperatures T

≈

130 K, fairly close to the normal boiling point of Kr (Tb ≈

≈

120 K)1.

We present here new data which extend the previous set in the region of low electric ﬁeld. The

experimental results are interpreted in terms of a kinetic model previously proposed to explain the

concentration dependent behavior of µ in liquid Ar–Kr and Ar–Xe mixtures. The main result is that

CH4 is more eﬀective in enhancing energy–transfer rather than momentum–transfer in comparison

with mixtures of liquiﬁed noble gases. The ﬁeld dependence of µ is quite complicate. In particular,

at intermediate values of the ﬁeld, there appears to be a crossover between two diﬀerent electric–

ﬁeld dependent behaviors of µ. The electric ﬁeld strength at crossover is well correlated with the

concentration of CH4. This fact suggests that diﬀerent excitations of the molecular solute might be

involved in the momentum– and energy–transfer processes for diﬀerent values of the mean electron

energy.

INTRODUCTION

The study of electron conduction in nonpolar liquids is of great fundamental and technical

interest2,3. Non polar liquids are examples of simple disordered materials. Theoretical

investigations of the electronic states in such media are connected to experiment by the low

ﬁeld behavior of the excess electron mobility4. The properties of excess electrons in such

media may also give useful information on the electronic states in noncrystalline solids5,6,7.

Non polar liquids are also used as sensitive media in high–energy physics ionization de-

tectors. For such an application it is essential to know the behavior of excess electrons in

the high–ﬁeld region, where detectors are typically operated, in order to understand the

basic electronic conduction mechanisms in that particular range for the goal of optimizing

the detectors’ performances8.

Liquiﬁed heavy noble gases, Ar, Kr, and Xe, are mainly used in ionization chambers

because of the combination of large density and high values of the excess electron mobilities.

At small electric ﬁelds mobilities exceeding several hundreds of cm2/V s have been mea-

sured9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

In these so–called high–mobility liquids electrons are assumed to be

quasifree because their mean free path is relatively long although they are moving in a very

dense environment of atoms which are very eﬀective scattering centers in the gas phase2.

At small electric ﬁelds electrons are in near thermal equilibrium with the atoms of the

host medium. The electron mobility is determined by processes of elastic scattering and is

approximately independent of the ﬁeld strength. In this region the drift velocity increases

linearly with the ﬁeld strength. At higher values of the ﬁeld the electron drift velocity in-

creases less than proportionally with the ﬁeld and, ﬁnally, it nearly saturates. This behavior

is related to the increase of the mean electron energy with the ﬁeld and to the dependence

of the scattering rate on the electron energy.

It has been shown6,16,17,18,19,20 that the addition of a molecular or atomic solute in small

proportion inﬂuences the dependence of the mobility on the ﬁeld strength, especially at high

ﬁelds. In particular, the saturation drift velocity is largely increased above the value in the

pure liquid. This eﬀect is commonly explained as due to a reduction of the electron mean

energy upon additional inelastic scattering with the impurities. These act as additional

scattering centers that are very eﬀective in thermalizing electrons even at quite large ﬁeld

strengths. In particular, for a spherical symmetric molecule like CH4, the inelastic processes

2

are assumed to be due to the excitation of the main vibrational levels of the molecule (0.16

and 1.75 eV )16,21 upon collisions with energetic enough electrons .

The search for the optimum combination of base liquid and impurity for the best detector

performance is far from being concluded17,18,19.

These mobility measurements are obviously important for detectors’ designers. However,

from a fundamental point of view these data may give additional hints for the description

of the electron mobility in liquids, which is not yet completely understood2. In fact, the

theoretical treatment of the ﬁeld behavior of the mobility in a pure liquid is far from being

satisfactory.

The description of the electron mobility in the liquid can be approached from two com-

pletely opposite directions. The ﬁrst approach is the so called single–scattering picture, es-

sentially due to Lekner22,23, in which electrons scatter oﬀ single atoms of the liquid or, more

precisely, they undergo a binary collision with a single interaction potential that takes into

account contributions from the potentials of nearby atoms. In this model, the two–term solu-

tion of the Boltzmann transport equation24,25 allows the calculation of an energy–dependent

scattering cross section.

At the opposite extreme, the deformation potential theory of Basak and Cohen (BC)26

represents the motion of the quasi–free electrons in the liquid as that of a wave in a quasi–

periodic structure.

In this model the electron mobility in a liquid is determined by the

scattering produced by ﬂuctuations of the bottom of the conduction band due to the intrinsic

density ﬂuctuations of the liquid.

In the latter model, the addition of a solute is assumed to enhance the disorder inherent to

a ﬂuid by introducing concentration ﬂuctuations in addition to the usual density ﬂuctuations.

In the former one, many–body and multiple scattering eﬀects are included in the cross

sections, which have now to be determined by a ﬁt to the experimental data.

On one hand, the BC model has been adapted with reasonable success to mixtures of

liquid hydrocarbons, where both solvent and solute are liquid at the same temperature27.

Unfortunately, its predictions have proven completely wrong when it is used for the descrip-

tion of the electron mobility in liquid mixtures of noble gases, namely Kr or Xe in liquid

Ar20.

A further drawback of the BC model, and of its extension to mixtures, is that it makes

predictions only on the zero–ﬁeld mobility and does not describe its electric–ﬁeld dependence,

3

which, on the contrary, is very important from the point of view of detectors’ design.

On the other hand, the single–scattering (or gas–kinetic) approach has been succesfully

used to describe the electric ﬁeld dependence of the electron mobility in liquid Ar and

methane28,29 by introducing two constant scattering cross sections, the momentum– and

energy–transfer cross sections, in the wake of Lekner’s theory. In this model, the many–body

and multiple scattering eﬀects due to the combined eﬀect of short interatomic distances and

large electron wavelength are embodied in the eﬀective cross sections. This dressing of the

scattering cross section due to multiple scattering eﬀects is also at the base of the heuristic

kinetic model, developed for the successful description of the electron mobility in dense noble

gases30,31,32,33.

The same gas–kinetic approach has proven also quite succesful in the case of mixtures of

liquiﬁed noble gases20. Although in pure Ar and CH4 the choice of two constant cross sections
provides a quite nice agreement with the experimental data28,29, an even better description of

the electron mobility as a function of the electric ﬁeld for all impurity concentrations in the

mixtures of liquiﬁed noble gases is obtained by assuming a constant momentum transfer cross

section σm and an energy–transfer cross section σE inversely proportional to the electron
energy ǫ, σE ∝
and its meaning is not clear yet. However, since in this gas–kinetic model the cross sections

1/ǫ20. This dependence has been chosen only on a phenomenological basis

are treated as adjustable parameters, it can be only said that this energy–dependent energy–

transfer cross section provides a much better ﬁt to the experimental data than a constant

cross section does.

In this work we have therefore more carefully investigated the eﬀect of the addition of the

molecular solute CH4 to pure liquid Kr, with emphasis on the low– and intermediate–ﬁeld

behavior of the mobility. Preliminary measurements, especially concerned with the mobility

behavior at high ﬁelds, have been reported previously1, keeping in mind the application of

such mixtures in ionization detectors. We report here a more complete study that includes

new measurements at quite small electric ﬁeld strengths aimed at a more physical goal.

This goal is twofold. On one hand, this mixture has never been studied before and might

be promising as a medium for ionization detectors. On the other hand, it represents a

diﬀerent benchmark for the validation of the gas–kinetic model and the determination of

the concentration dependence of the eﬀective cross sections might contribute useful pieces of

information on the eﬀectiveness of elastic and inelastic electron scattering processes in the

4

liquid.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experimental apparatus has been described elsewhere1 and we refer to literature for

the details. We recall here only the essential features of the experiment. The cell is a typical

double–gridded ionization chamber. Excess electrons are photoextracted from a Ni–coated

brass cathode by a short pulse of ultraviolet light produced by a Xe ﬂashlamp. The four

electrodes, anode, cathode and the two grids, are kept at suitable voltages in order to ensure

the maximum grid transparency34. Several guard rings are kept at the appropriate voltage

by a resistor cascade in order to ensure the maximum ﬁeld uniformity in the cylindrical drift

space.

The electrodes are connected to charge ampliﬁers. The signal induced by the drifting

electrons is recorded by a digital oscilloscope and analyzed by means of a personal computer.

The drift time can be easily determined by analyzing the signal shape. To span a large region

of electric ﬁelds in a single sweep both the drift times between the cathode and the ﬁrst grid

and between the ﬁrst and the second grid are recorded simultaneously. The drift time in the

region between the second grid and the anode, owing to the short distance and to the strong

ﬁeld between these two electrodes, cannot be measured reliably and has not been recorded.

The two sets of drift mobility measured in the ﬁrst and second region agree well with each

other within the experimental accuracy where the ﬁeld values overlap. The overall accuracy

of the mobility measurements is better than 10 %.

Very pure, commercially available gaseous mixtures of CH4 in Xe of diﬀerent and known

composition are condensed in the cell through an Oxisorb puriﬁer to remove oxygen and

water vapor impurities. The cell is cooled down to the desired temperature by immersion

in an isopentane bath cooled by liquid N2. Two thermoresistors located in the cell near the

cathode and the anode, respectively, provide constant monitoring of the temperature. The

temperature is stable within

0.5 K.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The excess electron mobility in liquid Kr has been measured as a function of the elec-

tric ﬁeld strength up to E

10 kV /cm at T

130 K for several mixtures of diﬀer-

≈

≈

ent composition. The liquid density of pure Kr at the temperature of the experiment is

N

≈

×

1026 m−3. The CH4 concentration, x, of the mixtures is x = 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2,

3, 5, and 10 %, respectively. As a calibration we have also measured the mobility in pure

liquid Krypton. Our data in the pure liquid agree well with literature data4.

We report the mobility as a function of the electric ﬁeld strength E for several of the

mixtures under investigation in Figure 1 and Figure 2 in order to avoid overcrowding of the

ﬁgures. All mixtures show similar features.

As usual, the electron mobility µ shows a low–ﬁeld behavior where it is essentially in-

dependent of the electric ﬁeld.

In this region the excess electrons are in near thermal

equilibrium with the atoms of the liquid, do not gain very much energy from the electric

ﬁeld, and mainly undergo elastic collisions that determine the mobility.

At higher ﬁelds, the mobility depends on the ﬁeld strength and decreases sharply with

increasing ﬁeld. In this region the mean electron energy is greatly enhanced by the ﬁeld and

the net eﬀect is a large increase of the scattering rate, leading to the observed decrease of

the mobility. This behavior is common to all mixtures with some important diﬀerences.

At small concentration of methane the eﬀect of the solute on the zero–ﬁeld mobility µ0

is not very large. Only for the highest CH4 concentration (x

10 %), there is a signiﬁcant

≈

reduction of µ0, as shown in ﬁgure 3. Small concentrations, as evident from Figures 1 and

2, do mostly inﬂuence the high–ﬁeld behavior of the mobility. An inﬂuence on momentum

transfer is obtained only at high methane concentrations. This behavior is similar to that

observed in mixtures of light alkanes in liquiﬁed noble gases6. However, this is the ﬁrst time

for this behavior to be observed in the present mixture of CH4 in liquid Kr.

Moreover, it has to be noted that the situation in mixtures of liquiﬁed noble gases is

completely diﬀerent as far as µ0(x) is concerned20. In fact, in the liquid Ar–Kr and liquid

Ar–Xe mixtures, µ0 decreases rapidly with increasing solute concentration, especially in the

Ar–Xe mixture.

In the Ar–Kr mixture, where a concentration of

30 % is reached, µ0

≈

eventually levels oﬀ and becomes nearly concentration independent. In the Ar–Xe mixture,

for concentration up x

5 %, µ0 decreases linearly with large neative slope as x is increased.

≈

6

The sharp decrease of µ with increasing E at larger ﬁelds (see Figures 1 and 2) is com-

monly attributed to the increase of the mean electron energy with increasing electric ﬁeld.

Between collisions, at higher ﬁelds, electrons pick up more energy from the ﬁeld than they

are able to share with the liquid upon collisions and thus become epithermal. The scattering

rate is consequently enhanced and the mobility decreases.

The change of the electric ﬁeld dependence of the mobility (see Figures 1 and 2) is

therefore due to the increase of the mean electron energy above the thermal value because

of the applied electric ﬁeld. Upon increasing the methane concentration in the mixture, the

region where the mobility is ﬁeld independent spans a wider ﬁeld range and the transition

to the hot–electron behavior shifts to larger ﬁeld strengths. Moreover, in the epithermal

region, higher ﬁeld strengths are required, upon increasing the impurity concentration, in

order to achieve the same mobility value. Since µ depends on the mean electron energy only,

provided that all other parameters are kept ﬁxed, this fact means that electrons reach the

same mean energy at larger ﬁelds for increasingly higher concentration of impurities.

These observations conﬁrm the assumption that molecular impurities are very eﬀective in

thermalizing electrons at larger ﬁelds although they are not as eﬀective as atomic impurities

as far as momentum transfer is concerned. Molecular impurities act as additional scattering

centers for electrons where they might lose energy in inelastic collisions more eﬃciently than

in the pure liquid.

A similar behavior has been observed also in liquid mixtures of liquiﬁed noble gases20,

where atomic impurities Xe and Kr were dissolved in liquid Ar. Also in that case, atomic

impurities extend the range of the thermal behavior of electrons. However, a stronger

dependence of µ0 on the impurity concentration was observed. This behavior is probably

related to the fact that atomic impurities have fewer inelastic scattering channels for low–

energy electrons than molecular impurities do and aﬀect more eﬀectively the momentum–

transfer– rather than the energy–transfer processes.

At high ﬁelds the drift mobility is determined essentially by the relative magnitudes of

elastic and inelastic energy loss rate. When inelastic losses become greater than the elastic

ones the drift mobility increases above the value of the pure liquid.

In order to carry out a simple analysis of the experimental data, we adopt the gas–kinetic

approach of Kaneko et al., based on the two–term solution of the Boltzmann transport

equation28,29. For a simple ﬂuid of number density N, the mobility µ is given by the usual

From Eqns. 1 and 2 it is evident that the mobility is primarily determined by the

momentum–transfer cross section, but the energy–transfer cross section also aﬀects the mo-

bility because it inﬂuences the electron energy distribution function by controlling the rate

at which energy is exchanged.

Strictly speaking, in order to account properly for the scattering of electrons oﬀ correlated

atoms in the ﬂuid35, Eq. 1 should be divided by the long–wavelength limit S(0) of the

static structure factor, that takes into account the compressibility of the medium. However,

according to Kaneko et al., we set S(0) = 1 and every correlation eﬀect is now accounted

for by the eﬀective cross section determined in this way.

By introducing constant values for the two relevant cross section σm and σE ≈

100σm,

this model reproduces quite well the low–ﬁeld limit of the experimental mobility in liquid

Ar and CH4, but is not very accurate in the high–ﬁeld region28,29.

A great improvement for the description of the mobility in this region has been obtained

by introducing an energy–dependent energy–transfer cross section of the form20

σE (ǫ) = σE0

πkBT

 

ǫ !

(3)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

This particular choice is heuristic and does not rely on any theory. However, it is interest-

ing to note that πkBT /ǫ is the square of the ratio of the de Broglie wavelength of an electron
of energy ǫ, λ = h/√2mǫ, to its thermal value, λT = h/√2mπkBT . In other words, it seems

8

that upon collisions the electron is exchanging energy with a cross section proportional to

the cross sectional area of the associated quantum wavepacket. In order to test this view,

mobility measurements should be carried out as a function of temperature. Anyway, we do

not insist on this point since it is merely speculative.

With the introduction of the analytic form of σE given in Eq. 3, the integrals in Eqns. 1

and 2 can be solved analytically, yielding

It is easy to show that with this choice of σE, at high–ﬁelds µ

E−1, so that the drift

velocity turns out to be approximately constant, as experimentally observed.

The extension of this model to binary mixtures is easily accomplished by introducing

the concept of an equivalent one–component ﬂuid with density N and mass M of the pure

solvent (in this case, Kr) but described by eﬀective scattering cross sections σm(x) and
σE0(x), which now depend on the solute concentration20.

We have therefore analyzed the present data according to Ref.20, by assuming, for each

mixtures of concentration x, that the momentum transfer cross section is energy independent

parameters. In ﬁgure 4 we show the values of the parameters resulting from the ﬁt.

2 ˚A2, to be compared to the value σE0 ≈

to electron energy relaxation, while it has a nearly negligible eﬀect on the processes of

momentum transfer.

It is not completely surprising that the energy transfer cross section is much larger than

the momentum transfer one because, as already pointed out in literature20,22,23, the eﬃciency

of energy transfer for thermal electrons is larger than that of momentum transfer by a factor

1/S(0)

1. In any case, we have to stress the fact that the behavior of the cross section

≈
with the concentration conﬁrms the picture that the addition of a molecular solute increases

≫

the chance of an electron undergoing scattering.

In ﬁgure 5 we show the result of this kind of ﬁt for the mixture with x

5 %. A similar

≈

behavior is found in all mixtures. It is easily observed that Eq. 4 correctly ﬁts the data only

up to intermediate ﬁeld strengths, of the order of several hundreds of V /cm, depending on

the solute concentration. For larger values, µ decreases less rapidly with increasing E. Its

ﬁeld dependence changes from the E−1 behavior, predicted by Eq. 4 with σE given by Eq.
3, to a softer E−1/2 behavior. This eﬀect is observed for all mixtures.

This new kind of ﬁeld dependence at large ﬁelds is typical for constant cross sections.

Therefore, at larger ﬁelds, hence at larger mean electron energies, the scattering events

determining the mobility resemble those due to a gas of hard spheres. However, we have

to recall that this kind of language is more pictorial than real, because we are considering

eﬀective cross sections dressed by many body and multiple scattering eﬀects in a gas–kinetic

model rather than real two–body collisions.

In the same Figure 5 we show the prediction of the gas–kinetic model where we have

introduced a constant σE, in order to simulate the results of hard–sphere scattering. The

two curves in the ﬁgure have been obtained with σE = σE0 (dashed line), with the value of

σE0 determined by the ﬁt with Eq. 4, and with σE = (2π/3)σE0 (dashed–dotted line), i.e.,

at thermal energy. In both cases, the calculated mobility at high ﬁelds is nearly parallel to

the experimental data.

In any case, the deviation of the mobility from the E−1

behavior towards the E−1/2

one

−

−

indicates that the processes of inelastic energy transfer are changing somewhat with the

electron energy, as though diﬀerent inelastic channels were opened by increasing the mean

10

electron energy, leading to a diﬀerent energy dependence of σE.

For the sake of completeness, it has to be noted that this change of behavior, though

less relevant, is observed also in pure liquid Kr. A possible explanation of the eﬀect in the

pure liquid might be related to the possible existence of the Ramsauer minimum of the cross

section also in the liquid, as argued by Christophorou et al.37. In this case, at high ﬁelds, the

electron energy distribution function is very broad and the cross section would be averaged

across the Ramsauer minimum, thus yielding approximately a constant value.

A careful inspection of the µ(E) data shows that µ deviates from the E−1

behavior

−

when it approximately has the same value (within a factor of order unity) for each mixture.

In other words, the deviation takes place when the mean electron energy is approximately

the same in all mixtures, independently of the methane concentration. This conﬁrms the

hypothesis that new inelastic channels related to the molecular impurity open up when the

mean electron energy exceeds a given threshold.

To give an estimate of the eﬀect, in ﬁgure 6 we plot the value E⋆ of the ﬁeld where µ takes

on the value µ⋆ and starts deviating from the E−1

behavior. This threshold electric ﬁeld

−

has a nice square–root dependence on the CH4 concentration. This is easy to understand
analytically if one inverts Eq. 4 with µ⋆/µ0(x) and σm(x) approximately constant, thus

obtaining

tion, with x. Hence, E⋆ is approximately proportional to x1/2. This observation is another

conﬁrmation of the fact that electrons are more eﬃciently thermalized by increasing the

impurity content of the mixture.

Within this gas–kinetic model, the mean electron energy can be calculated as

IV. CONCLUSIONS

As observed in many other liquid mixtures, also in CH4−

doped liquid Kr the addition of

molecular impurities increases the eﬃciency of electron thermalization. This fact permits to

increase the drift velocity of electrons in the mixtures used as sensitive media in ionization

detectors with respect to case of the pure liquid.

The use of the gas–kinetic approach also in liquid mixtures to describe the electric ﬁeld

dependence of the electron mobility gives very nice results. It is a very simple model that re-

lies on a very easy physical picture to grasp, namely a binary–collisions picture. Nonetheless,

in spite of its simplicity, the gas–kinetic model gives useful information about the relative

strength of elastic and inelastic processes through the magnitude and concentration depen-

dence of the eﬀective cross sections, σm for the momentum–transfer and σE for the energy

transfer.

In the case of CH4−

doped liquid Kr, the molecular solute has a relatively small inﬂuence

on the momentum–transfer processes, as deduced from the fact that the zero–ﬁeld mobility

µ0 does not depend very much on the methane concentration. On the contrary, CH4 impuri-

ties originate an eﬃcient energy relaxation of excess electrons. This fact has the consequence

that collisional ionization of the liquid mixture should be more diﬃcult to reach, yielding

higher breakdown ﬁelds in the mixtures than in the pure liquid.

of the kinetic model with two diﬀerent values of an energy–independent energy–transfer

cross section.

Figure 6 Concentration–dependent behavior of the electric ﬁeld values E⋆ beyond which the

mobility data are no longer well described by an energy–transfer cross section inversely

proportional to the electron energy. The solid line is a square–root ﬁt to the data.

the ﬁeld E⋆ where the high–ﬁeld behavior of the electron mobility changes from the

E−1 to the E−1/2 dependence. The solid line is only a guide for the eye.

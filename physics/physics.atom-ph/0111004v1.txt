Statistical Properties of Fano Resonances in Atomic and Molecular Photoabsorption

Wolfgang Ihra

Hermann-Herder-Str. 3, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany

Statistical properties of Fano resonances occurring in photoabsorption to highly excited atomic
or molecular states are derived. The situation with one open and one closed channel is analyzed
when the classical motion of the excited complex in the closed channel is chaotic. The closed channel
subspace is modeled by random matrix theory. The probability distribution of the Fano parameter is
derived both for the case of time reversal symmetry (TRS) and broken time reversal symmetry. For
the TRS case the area distribution under a resonance proﬁle relevant for low resolution experiments
is discussed in detail.

Introduction — Resonance phenomena are ubiquitous
in highly excited quantum systems. Typical examples
are auto-ionizing atomic resonances [1] or photodissoci-
ation of rovibrational molecular states [2]. When the
density of resonances is high a common and natural way
to extract information about resonance properties is to
resort to statistical methods [3, 4, 5]. Typically as a
consequence of the high excitation the resonant complex
behaves chaotically from a classical point of view. It is
then appropriate to model the excited complex by means
of random matrix theory [6, 7, 8].

Here I address a problem frequently encountered in
photoabsorption processes of atomic and molecular sys-
tems: What are the statistical properties of line shapes
when photoabsorption into a highly excited resonant
state takes place? Since the seminal work of Fano [9]
it is known that when at least two pathways exist for
an atomic or molecular system to decay after having
absorbed a photon the line shapes of resonances dif-
fer in general considerably from the Breit-Wigner form.
In photodissociation of molecules or photoexcitation of
an atom to an auto-ionizing resonance interference be-
tween the indirect and the direct decay process results
in a Beutler-Fano resonance proﬁle of the photoabsorp-
tion cross section [1, 10, 11] (abbreviated as Fano proﬁle
in the following). The shape of the resonant part of the
cross section is determined by a single parameter, the
Fano parameter q. This contribution is aimed at such a
statistical theory of Fano resonances.

It is worthwhile to stress that atomic and molecular
systems are ideally suited to test the predictions on Fano
resonances as neither Coulomb or dephasing eﬀects which
may become relevant in mesoscopic structures have to be
taken into account [12].

Theory — For photodissociation of a molecule Fig. 1
schematically depicts the situation envisaged [13]. The
molecule is coherently laser excited from the ground state
or a low lying state
of energy E0 onto two electronic
potential surfaces. The transition is accomplished by the
dipole operator D. Electronic surface S1 is the open

channel — the energy E of the molecular complex is
above the dissociation threshold — while the motion on
the potential surface S2 is bound (closed channel). The
dipole matrix element for transition to the open channel
is the regu-

Laser excitation takes place from a low lying electronic po-
tential surface (dipole operator D). The classical dynamics
on surface S2 is bound and chaotic. Dissociation can take
place directly by dipole excitation to channel 1 or indirectly
by excitation to channel 2 and the coupling V between the
surfaces S1 and S2.

The distribution of the Fano parameter is derived un-
der the two following conditions: Firstly the classical
motion of the excited molecular complex on the elec-
tronic surface S1 of the closed channel is completely
chaotic. This ensures that the statistical properties of
generic wave functions in chaotic systems apply and that
the closed channel subspace can be modeled by random
matrix theory [3]. Secondly the excitation process and
the coupling between the two electronic surfaces are as-
sumed to be spatially well separated: the overlap of the
initial wave packet

Distribution of the Fano parameter — With these in-
gredients the calculation of the probability distribution
P (q) of the Fano parameter is straightforward. (The in-
dex n of the resonance is omitted in the following.) In
the case of time reversal symmetry the wave functions
and viz. x and y can be chosen real. The closed channel
N matrices taken from the
subspace is modeled by N
×
Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). All results are un-
derstood in the limit N

and Pσx (x) is the probability distribution of x (and like-
wise for y). The integral is most easily evaluated by using
the Fourier integral representation of the delta function
and the result is

The probability distribution of the Fano parameter in the
GOE case thus turns out to be Lorentzian with mean
value q and width s.

The width s of the probability distribution is related
to the coupling strength V between the closed channel
and the continuum channel and the ratio of the dipole
transition matrix elements to both channels. Assume V
can be written in the form V = λV0 where λ character-
λ
izes the coupling strength and V0 is ﬁxed. Then σy ∼
and therefore s
1/λ. For strong coupling to the con-
tinuum the Lorentz distribution acquires a small width
centered around q. The same holds if direct photoexci-
tation dominates over the indirect process since then σx
becomes small.

In the case of broken time reversal symmetry the
N
Hamiltonian of the closed channel is modeled by N
matrices from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). In
this case x and y are complex Gaussian random vari-
ables with independent real and imaginary parts and the
Fano parameter is in general complex. Most conveniently
the distribution of q is characterized by the probability
distribution of the phase ϕq and the modulus rq of the
quantity q
. The phases ϕx of x and ϕy of y are
i
uniformly distributed mod(2π) and the same holds for
ϕy. Denoting the modulus of x by rx and of y
ϕq = ϕx −
by ry the probability distribution PGUE(rq) is given by

where sr ≡

GOE case the width sr of the probability distribution
PGUE(rq) is determined by the strength of the coupling
between the two channels and the ratio of the strength
between the dipole transition to the closed and to the
open channel.

Peak height distribution for GOE — For the TRS case
the maximum of the Fano proﬁle is given at ǫ = 1/q with
Df (bg)]/Df (bg) = q2 relative to the

scaled variable z/q2 and diﬀerent values of the parameter
β = q/s. It has a local maximum at a value 0 < z/q2 < 1
for β
1.95517. Therefore for a local maximum to occur
the width s of the Lorentz proﬁle (4) must be smaller
than approximately twice the average value q of the Fano
the position of the maximum
parameter. For β
approaches z = q2.

Proﬁle area distribution for GOE — In low resolu-
tion experiments the relevant experimental quantity is
the proﬁle area distribution under the resonance rather
than the peak height distribution. To be more speciﬁc as-
sume that the band width δE of the exciting laser beam is
larger than the width Γ of the resonance but still smaller
than the mean spacing ∆ between adjacent resonances
(Γ < δE < ∆). Assuming a rectangular laser proﬁle
the excess oscillator strength averaged over the resonance
proﬁle with respect to the background strength is given

Fig. 3 demonstrates the dependence of P ( ˆΘ) at ﬁxed
q = 0 in the three characteristic regimes µ < 0, µ = 0
and µ > 0 by varying s. For µ = 0 the probability
distribution is symmetric with respect to ˆΘ = 0 (solid

the ﬂat side at negative values of ˆΘ (dashed line). The
opposite holds for µ > 0 (dot-dashed line).

As µ depends both on s and q a contour plot of µ as
a function of (q, 1/s) is presented in Fig. 4. The vari-
able 1/s instead of s has been chosen for matters of dis-
corresponds to the limit of strong
cussion as 1/s

motion in the closed channel is chaotic. This situation is
frequently encountered in photodissociation of highly ex-
cited rovibrational states of molecules or photoabsorption
of atoms to auto-ionizing resonances. The closed channel
subspace is modeled by random matrix theory. The dis-
tribution of the Fano parameter q was derived for both
the GOE and the GUE cases. The peak height distribu-
tion and the resonance area distribution were discussed
in detail for the GOE.

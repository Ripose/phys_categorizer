Electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) was ob-
served on a sample of 85Rb in a magneto-optical trap using low
intensity cw copropagating pump and probe optical ﬁelds. At
moderate trapping ﬁeld intensity, the EIA spectrum is deter-
mined by the Zeeman eﬀect produced on the atomic ground-
state by the trapping quadrupolar magnetic ﬁeld. The use
of EIA spectroscopy for the magnetic ﬁeld mapping of cold
atomic samples is illustrated.

I. INTRODUCTION.

The interaction of radiation with a coherently prepared
atomic medium has attracted considerable attention in
recent years [1]. While most coherent processes have
been studied using three or more atomic energy levels,
it was recently demonstrated that degenerate two-level
systems constitute an interesting host for coherent spec-
troscopical eﬀects [2–4]. A new coherent eﬀect observed
in degenerate two-level systems, is the increase of the
atomic absorption occurring when the lower atomic en-
ergy level has a smaller (angular momentum) degeneracy
than the upper level and the frequencies of two mutually
coherent optical ﬁelds match the condition for Raman
resonance between ground-state Zeeman sublevels. This
phenomenon, the change in sign taken apart, share sev-
eral properties with electromagnetically induced trans-
parency (EIT) [5] and was designated electromagnetically
induced absorption (EIA) [2,3]. The spectral properties
of EIA depending on ﬁeld intensity, magnetic ﬁeld and
optical ﬁelds polarizations were recently analyzed [6]. In
particular, the sensitive dependence of the EIA spectrum
on magnetic ﬁeld makes it a potentially useful tool for the
characterization of the magnetic atomic environment [7].
To date, the reported observations of EIA were carried in
vapor samples. It is worth noticing that the atomic tran-
sitions normally used for magneto-optical trapping and
cooling verify the conditions for EIA [3]: they are closed
transitions with a larger angular momentum in the ex-
cited state than in the ground state. This paper presents
the ﬁrst observation of EIA on a cold atomic sample in a

magneto optical trap (MOT) using the trapping transi-
tion. It is shown that EIA constitute a simple and direct
tool for the inspection of the atomic density distribution
with respect to the trapping quadrupolar magnetic ﬁeld
[8].

We have performed EIA spectroscopy on a sample of
magneto-optically cooled 85Rb atoms in the presence of
the trapping MOT ﬁeld. In addition to the ﬁelds neces-
sary for the MOT operation, the sample was submitted
to a ﬁxed frequency pump ﬁeld and a tunable probe ﬁeld
with linear and mutually orthogonal polarizations. Both
ﬁelds were quasiresonant with the closed 5S1/2(F = 3) →
5P3/2(F ′ = 4) transition of 85Rb (trapping transition).
A copropagating geometry was used for the pump and
the probe waves. This geometry has the advantage of
avoiding a spatial dependence of the relative phase be-
tween the pump and the probe ﬁeld that would exist, for
instance, in a counter-propagating geometry and allow
more direct comparison with theory. However, the co-
propagating geometry has the disadvantage of requiring
very low intensity in both the pump and probe waves
to avoid “blowing” the trapped atoms by the radiative
force exerted by the quasiresonant ﬁelds. Consequently,
EIA was observed only in a regime of pump and probe
intensities many orders of magnitude below saturation
for which the perturbation of the MOT by the pump and
probe ﬁeld was observed to be negligible. Since small ﬁeld
intensities were used, the corresponding EIA resonances
were small compared to the linear absorption. This re-
quired the use of a highly sensitive detection technique
in order to distinguish the EIA resonances from the large
linear absorption background. A double-frequency lock-
in detection was used.

II. SETUP.

The experiments were done on a standard magneto op-
tical trap for 85Rb with three pairs of counterpropagating
trapping beams along orthogonal directions. The max-
imum available total trapping ﬁeld power was 20 mW
and the trapping beam cross section 1 cm. A repump-
ing ﬁeld of 1 mW generated by an independent laser
was superimposed to the trapping beams. The MOT
used a quadrupolar magnetic ﬁeld distribution with a
magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 1 G/mm along the symmetry
axis (vertical). The MOT produced a cold atom cloud
of typical 0.7 mm transverse dimension containing (at

1

maximum trapping ﬁeld power) 107 atoms. The trap-
ping and pump ﬁelds were obtained from the same (fre-
quency stabilized) extended cavity diode laser (master
laser) using in each case the following procedure: the
output of the master laser was frequency shifted by an
acousto optic modulator (AOM) to a ﬁxed frequency po-
sition relative to the 5S1/2(F = 3) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 4)
atomic transition and used to injection-lock a separate
laser diode for power increase. As in [2], the probe ﬁeld
was obtained from the pump by the use of two addi-
tional consecutive AOMs, one of them driven by a tun-
able RF generator. In this way, all three trapping, pump
and probe ﬁelds were highly correlated. The pump and
probe waves with orthogonal linear polarizations are su-
perimposed on a 50 cm long polarization-preserving sin-
gle mode optical ﬁber and subsequently focussed on the
cold atoms sample (0.3 mm beam waist). Intensity was
controlled with neutral density ﬁlters in order to have
approximately the same power in the pump and probe
waves. At the sample, both waves had a central inten-
sity around 0.1 µW/cm2. The pump and the probe ﬁelds
were mechanically chopped at frequencies f1 and f2 (1
and 1.2 kHz respectively). After the sample, a photo-
diode detected the transmitted light. The photodiode
output was analyzed with a lock-in ampliﬁer using as
reference the sum frequency f = f1 + f2. With this tech-
nique, only the nonlinear component of the absorption,
proportional to the product of the pump and probe ﬁeld
intensities was detected. The spectra were recorded by
scanning the frequency oﬀset between the tunable probe
and the ﬁxed-frequency pump.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.

An example of a low resolution nonlinear absorption
spectrum as a function of the frequency diﬀerence be-
tween the probe and the pump ﬁelds is presented in Fig.
1. In this spectrum, the pump frequency is kept ﬁxed at
the center of the 5S1/2(F = 3) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 4) transi-
tion of 85Rb. The spectrum presents three distinct fea-
tures. Two of these are centered around δ = 0. There is
a broad resonance (dip) whose width is given by the ex-
cited state width Γ/2π = 6M Hz. At the bottom of this
resonance there is a much narrower one with opposite
sign. The broad resonance corresponds to an increase in
the transmission due to the saturation of the sample by
the pump ﬁeld while the narrow feature represents an in-
crease of the absorption. The latter corresponds to EIA.
The sub-natural width of this resonance is an indication
of its coherent nature. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the cal-
culated signal around δ = 0 using the model described
in [3,6]. An interesting feature in the spectrum in Fig. 1
is the large dip appearing around δ ≃ −10 M Hz. This
resonance occurs when the probe frequency equals the
frequency of the trapping beams (red-detuned 10 M Hz

with respect to the atomic transition). Since, as a conse-
quence of the technique used for the ﬁelds preparation,
the probe, pump and trapping beams are highly corre-
lated, it is rather natural to observe a coherent resonance
involving the probe and the trapping ﬁelds. However,
keeping in mind the two-frequencies detection technique
used, the pump ﬁeld must also participate in the gen-
eration of any detected signal. Consequently the peak
observed around δ ≃ −10 M Hz corresponds to a non-
linear process involving at least one photon from each of
the tree ﬁelds (pump, probe and trapping). The study of
this multiphoton eﬀect is beyond the scope of this paper.
We focus our attention on the EIA structure observed
around δ = 0. Fig. 2(a) presents a detailed view of this
structure observed in a MOT with a total trapping beams
power attenuated to approximately 4m W/cm2. Under
this condition the linear absorption by the cold atoms
was maximum (40%) at the trapping transition. A triplet
structure is clearly visible which is reminiscent of the EIA
spectrum obtained in a homogeneous sample for perpen-
dicular pump and probe polarizations in the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld orthogonal to both polarizations [6]. The
observed value of the frequency separation between the
center and the two sidebands would correspond in that
case to a magnetic ﬁeld of B ≈ 0.3 G. This ﬁgure is of the
order of the typical magnetic ﬁeld magnitude within the
cold atoms volume due to the quadrupolar distribution.
Since in our experiment the pump and probe beams over-
lap a signiﬁcant fraction (20%) of the cold atomic sample,
the EIA spectrum is due to the average contribution from
atoms in diﬀerent magnetic environments.

The hypothesis that the observed structure of the EIA
spectrum is determined by the magnetic ﬁeld present at
the MOT can be tested by adding a small bias magnetic
ﬁeld at the sample. This was achieved by varying the
current in the Helmholtz coils surrounding the trap that
are normally used to compensate the earth ﬁeld. The
eﬀect of the bias ﬁeld is to change the magnetic ﬁeld
distribution at the position explored by the pump and
probe waves. It also produces a translation of the cloud
that results in a variation in the total number of atoms
interacting with the pump and probe waves. Signiﬁcant
changes in the relative weight and positions of the res-
onances occur for diﬀerent bias magnetic ﬁelds. Since
in these measurements the pump, probe and trapping
ﬁelds are kept unchanged, we conclude that the observed
spectral structure is mainly determined by the magnetic
ﬁeld. When the pump-probe beam was carefully aligned
through the atomic cloud for maximum linear absorp-
tion, the observed structure of the EIA spectrum was a
triplet [Fig. 2(a)]. This structure represents the total
response of the magnetically inhomogeneous sample. We
have compared this observation with the numerical cal-
culation of the response arising from 1000 atoms in diﬀer-
ent positions in an ideal MOT. We used a Monte Carlo
procedure where the position of the atom is randomly

2

chosen (uniform distribution) within an oblate ellipsoidal
volume, representing the trapped cloud, centered at the
zero of a quadrupolar magnetic ﬁeld. The vertical dimen-
sion (along the symmetry axis) of the ellipsoid is shorter
by a factor of two than the horizontal one. The abso-
lute value of the magnetic ﬁeld at the points where the
principal axis intercept the ellipsoid surface is BMAX .
The pump ﬁeld polarization is vertical and the probe po-
larization horizontal. For each atomic position the local
magnetic ﬁeld is evaluated [8] and the corresponding non-
linear response is calculated using the model described in
[6]. Then the total absorption is calculated as the sum
of the individual atomic contributions. The result of the
simulation is shown in Fig. 2(b) where a realistic value
of BMAX = 0.8 G has been chosen. The total absorption
spectrum is a triplet in agreement with our observation.
Unlike, the ideal ellipsoidal sample assumed for the cal-
culation, the actual cloud of cold atoms is not symmetric
around the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution. This
is due to power imbalance and wavefront irregularities in
the counterpropagating trapping beams. This produces
a cold cloud displaced from the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld
with an asymmetric shape and an irregular atomic den-
sity distribution. This explains the fact that varying the
position of the pump-probe beam across the atomic sam-
ple we were able to observe signiﬁcant variations of the
nonlinear absorption shape ranging from a single-peak
spectrum, a doublet, a triplet or even a ﬁve-peaks struc-
ture.

Considering that the EIA spectra were recorded with
the trapping ﬁeld on, it is somehow surprising to ob-
serve spectral structures determined by the Zeeman shift
of ground-state sublevels by the quadrupolar magnetic
ﬁeld.
In the trapping region, the resonant interaction
of the atoms with the trapping ﬁeld results in signiﬁcant
displacement of the atomic levels due to (AC Stark) light
shift. The magnitude of the light shift is diﬀerent for dif-
ferent ground-state sublevels and depends on the local
trapping ﬁeld intensity and polarization experienced by
the atom. The six trapping beams are responsible for a
rather complicate interference pattern resulting in three
dimensional modulation of the trapping ﬁeld intensity
and polarization with a spatial period of half wavelength
[9]. The importance of the ground-state sublevels light
shifts in a MOT is well illustrated by the peculiar shape of
the absorption spectra of the trapped atoms in the MOT
[10] analyzed by Grison and coworkers [11]. The inﬂu-
ence of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels light shifts on
the absorption spectra of strongly driven degenerate two-
level systems was studied in [12]. Since the light shifts
are uncorrelated with the Zeeman shift produced by the
quadrupolar magnetic ﬁeld, one should expect that the
former will result in an inhomogeneous dispersion of the
energies of the ground-state sublevels producing a smear-
ing of the EIA resonance frequencies.

We have observed the variation of the EIA spectrum

with the intensity of the trapping ﬁeld (Fig. 3). For low
trapping ﬁeld intensities a well resolved triplet was ob-
tained. The width of the central peak of the upper trace
in Fig. 3 is 30 kHz. This is to our knowledge the narrow-
est coherent resonance observed to date in an operating
MOT [10,11,13–15]. As the trapping ﬁeld intensity is in-
creased, the EIA resonances broaden. For large enough
trapping ﬁeld intensity, the triplet structure transforms
into a unique broad peak.
It is worth noticing that a
regime can be found where the trapped cloud is rather
dense (linear absorption around 40%) while at the same
time the magnetic-ﬁeld-dependent structure of the EIA
spectrum remains clearly resolved.
In this regime the
modiﬁcation of the ground-state sublevels by the light
shift produced by the trapping ﬁeld is small compared to
the Zeeman shift.

The fact that the EIA spectrum reﬂects the magnetic-
ﬁeld distribution within the trapped atoms cloud may
be used for mapping the magnetic-ﬁeld variations inside
the cold atoms sample. This possibility is illustrated in
ﬁgure 4 showing the modiﬁcation of the EIA spectrum
as the pump-probe beam is translated in the equatorial
plane of the cold atom cloud. Between two consecutive
traces of Fig. 4 the pump-probe beam was translated
by 100 µm. From bottom to top, the spectra in ﬁgure
4 evolve from a well resolved tripled into a broad unre-
solved peak. The series in Fig. 4 may be interpreted as a
mapping of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the cold atoms cloud
averaged over the volume explored by the pump-probe
beam. In these measurements the pump-probe beam di-
ameter at the sample is 0.3 mm a ﬁgure which is only
a factor of 2.3 smaller than the estimated cold atoms
cloud diameter. This limits in our case the spatial res-
olution of the magnetic ﬁeld mapping. A two orders of
magnitude improvement in the resolution is in principle
possible with a tight focussed pump-probe beam. The
spectra presented in Fig. 4 clearly indicate the lack of
symmetry of our MOT. As a matter of fact, the zero of
the magnetic ﬁeld, around which symmetric variations of
the EIA spectrum should take place, is located outside
the region of large atomic density.

The mapping of the magnetic ﬁeld using EIA spec-
troscopy, appear as a rather simple and straightforward
technique. It can be achieved in a cw regime without the
need for turning oﬀ the MOT trapping beams and with
very low-power pump and probe ﬁelds. As demonstrated
here, these ﬁelds can be easily obtained from the trapping
laser. As in the example shown, qualitative information
about the atomic density distribution with respect to the
quadrupolar magnetic ﬁeld is directly inferred from the
spectra. The ﬁtting of the experimental EIA spectra to
theoretical predictions (based on consistent assumptions
for the trapped cloud density distribution) can in princi-
ple be used as a tomographic technique for the character-
ization of the atoms in the MOT [8]. This approach was
not developed in the present case in view of the irregular

We have observed EIA resonances on a sample of cold
atoms in a MOT in the presence of the trapping light
beams. An operating regime of the MOT (with moder-
ate trapping beams intensity) could be found where the
atomic density is quite large while at the same time the
atomic ground state is weakly perturbed by the trapping
ﬁeld. In this regime the energy shift of the ground state
sublevels is essentially governed by the Zeeman eﬀect.
Coherent resonances as narrow as 30 kHz were observed
for the ﬁrst time in an operating MOT. EIA absorption
spectroscopy, performed in a cw regime with very low
optical intensities, appears as a suitable tool for the in-
spection of the Zeeman shift produced for the quadrupo-
lar magnetic ﬁeld at diﬀerent positions of the cold atom
sample.

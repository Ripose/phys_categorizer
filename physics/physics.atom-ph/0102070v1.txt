INTRODUCTION

Many-body methods have proven to be a highly accurate tool for determination of atomic
properties, especially for systems with one valence electron outside a closed-shell core [1]. For
alkali-metal atoms a comparison of highly-accurate experimental data with calculations [2]
allows one to draw a conclusion that modern ab initio methods are capable of predicting
basic properties of low-lying states with a precision better than 1%.

1 and nsnp 3P o

For divalent atoms such a comprehensive comparison was previously hindered by a lack
of high-precision measurements of radiative lifetimes. Despite the lifetimes of the lowest
nsnp 1P o
1 states were repeatedly obtained both experimentally and theoretically
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], persistent
discrepancies remain. Only very recently, Zinner et al. [3] have achieved 0.4% accuracy for
the rate of 4s4p 1P o
1 → 4s2 1S0 transition in calcium. This high-precision value was deduced
from photoassociation spectroscopy of ultracold calcium atoms. One of the purposes of the
present work is to test the quality of many-body techniques for two-valence electron systems
by comparing our result with the experimental value from Ref. [3].

We extend the earlier work [25] and report results of relativistic many-body calcula-
tion of energy levels and electric-dipole transition amplitudes for Mg, Ca and Sr. The
calculations are performed in the framework of conﬁguration-interaction approach coupled
with many-body perturbation theory [26, 27]. We tabulate electric-dipole amplitudes for
1P o
2 → 1D2 transitions and estimate
theoretical uncertainties.

1 → 1S0, 1D2, and for 3P o

1 → 1S0, 3S1, 1D2, for 3P o

Cooling and trapping experiments with alkaline-earth atoms were recently reported for
Mg [4], Ca [3, 29], and Sr [28, 30]. The prospects of achieving Bose-Einstein condensation
were also discussed [3, 31]. Our accurate transition amplitudes will be helpful in designs
In addition, these amplitudes will aid in determi-
of cooling schemes and atomic clocks.
nation of long-range atomic interactions, required in calculation of scattering lengths and
interpretation of cold-collision data. For example, dispersion (van der Waals) coeﬃcient
C6 characterizes the leading dipole-dipole interaction of two ground-state atoms at large
internuclear separations [32]. The coeﬃcient C6 is expressed in terms of energy separations
and electric-dipole matrix elements between the ground and excited atomic states. Approx-
imately 80% of the total value of C6 arises from the principal transition nsnp 1P o
1 − ns2 1S0,
requiring accurate predictions for the relevant matrix element. Therefore our results will be
also useful in determination of dispersion coeﬃcients.

II. METHOD OF CALCULATIONS

In atomic-structure calculations, correlations are conventionally separated into three
classes: valence-valence, core-valence, and core-core correlations. A strong repulsion of
valence electrons has to be treated non-perturbatively, while it is impractical to handle the
two other classes of correlations with non-perturbative techniques, such as conﬁguration-
interaction (CI) method. Therefore, it is natural to combine many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT) with one of the non-perturbative methods. It was suggested [26] to use MBPT to
construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ deﬁned in the model space of valence electrons. En-
ergies and wavefunctions of low-lying states are subsequently determined using CI approach,
i.e. diagonalizing Heﬀ in the valence subspace. Atomic observables are calculated with ef-
fective operators [27]. Following the earlier work, we refer to this method as CI+MBPT

2

In the CI+MBPT approach the energies and wavefunctions are determined from the

formalism.

Schr¨odinger equation

where the eﬀective Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

Heﬀ(En) |Φni = En |Φni ,

Heﬀ(E) = HFC + Σ(E).

(1)

(2)

Here HFC is the two-electron Hamiltonian in the frozen core approximation and Σ is the
energy-dependent correction, involving core excitations. The operator Σ completely accounts
for the second order of perturbation theory. Determination of the second order corrections
requires calculation of one– and two–electron diagrams. The one–electron diagrams describe
an attraction of a valence electron by a (self-)induced core polarization. The two-electron
diagrams are speciﬁc for atoms with several valence electrons and represent an interaction
of a valence electron with core polarization induced by another valence electron.

Already at the second order the number of the two–electron diagrams is large and their
computation is very time-consuming. In the higher orders the calculation of two-electron
diagrams becomes impractical. Therefore we account for the higher orders of MBPT indi-
rectly. It was demonstrated [33] that a proper approximation for the eﬀective Hamiltonian
can substantially improve an agreement between calculated and experimental spectra of
multielectron atom. One can introduce an energy shift δ and replace Σ(E) → Σ(E − δ)
in the eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (2). The choice δ=0 corresponds to the Brillouin-Wigner
variant of MBPT and the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger variant is recovered setting δ = En − E(0)
n ,
where E(0)
is the zero-order energy of level n. The latter is more adequate for multielectron
n
systems [34]; for few-electron systems an intermediate value of δ is optimal. We have deter-
mined δ from a ﬁt of theoretical energy levels to experimental spectrum. Such an optimized
eﬀective Hamiltonian was used in calculations of transition amplitudes.

To obtain an eﬀective electric-dipole operator we solved random-phase approximation
(RPA) equations, thus summing a certain sequence of many-body diagrams to all orders
of MBPT. The RPA describes a shielding of externally applied ﬁeld by core electrons. We
further incorporated one- and two-electron corrections to the RPA to account for a diﬀerence
between the VN and VN −2 potentials and for the Pauli exclusion principle. In addition, the
eﬀective operator included corrections for normalization and structural radiation [27]. The
RPA equations depend on transition frequency and should be solved independently for each
transition. However, the frequency dependence was found to be rather weak and we solved
these equations only at some characteristic frequencies. To monitor a consistency of the
calculations we employed both length (L) and velocity (V) gauges for the electric-dipole
operator.

The computational procedure is similar to calculations of hyperﬁne structure constants
and electric-dipole amplitudes for atomic ytterbium [35, 36]. We consider Mg, Ca and Sr as
atoms with two valence electrons above closed cores [1s,...,2p6], [1s,...,3p6], and [1s,...,4p6],
respectively [37]. One-electron basis set for Mg included 1s–13s, 2p–13p, 3d–12d, and 4f –
11f orbitals, where the core- and 3,4s, 3,4p, 3,4d, and 4f orbitals were Dirac-Hartree-Fock
(DHF) ones, while all the rest were virtual orbitals. The orbitals 1s–3s were constructed by
solving the DHF equations in VN approximation, 3p orbitals were obtained in the VN −1 ap-
proximation, and 4s, 4p, 3,4d, and 4f orbitals were constructed in the VN −2 approximation.
We determined virtual orbitals using a recurrent procedure, similar to Ref. [38] and employed
in previous work [26, 27, 35, 36]. The one-electron basis set for Ca included 1s–13s, 2p–13p,

3

3d–12d, and 4f –11f orbitals, where the core- and 4s, 4p, and 3d orbitals are DHF ones,
while the remaining orbitals are the virtual orbitals. The orbitals 1s–4s were constructed by
solving the DHF equations in the VN approximation, and 4p and 3d orbitals were obtained
in the VN −1 approximation. Finally, the one-electron basis set for Sr included 1s–14s, 2p–
14p, 3d–13d, and 4f –13f orbitals, where the core- and 5s, 5p, and 4d orbitals are DHF ones,
and all the rest are the virtual orbitals. The orbitals 1s–5s were constructed by solving
the DHF equations in the VN approximation, and 5p and 4d orbitals were obtained in the
VN −1 approximation. Conﬁguration-interaction states were formed using these one-particle
basis sets. It is worth emphasizing that the employed basis sets were suﬃciently large to
obtain numerically converged CI results. A numerical solution of random-phase approxima-
tion equations required an increase in the number of virtual orbitals. Such extended basis
sets included 1s–ks, 2p–kp, 3d–(k-1)d, 4f –(k-4)f , and 5g–(k-8)g orbitals, where k=19,20,21
for Mg, Ca, and Sr, respectively. Excitations from all core shells were included in the RPA
setup.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Energy levels

In Tables I – III we present calculated energies of low-lying states for Mg, Ca, and
Sr and compare them with experimental values. The two-electron binding energies were
obtained both in the framework of conventional conﬁguration-interaction method and using
the formalism of CI coupled with many-body perturbation theory. Already at the CI stage
the agreement of the calculated and experimental energies is at the level of 5%. The addition
of many-body corrections to the Hamiltonian improves the accuracy by approximately an
order of magnitude. Finally, with an optimal choice of parameter δ the agreement with
experimental values improves to 0.1–0.2%.

1 – 1P o

Compared to the binding energies, ﬁne-structure splitting of triplet states and singlet-
triplet energy diﬀerences represent a more stringent test of our method. For the 3P o
1,2,3-states
the ﬁne-structure splitting is reproduced with an accuracy of several per cent in the pure CI
for all the three atoms, while the 3P o
1 energy diﬀerences are less accurate (especially
for Ca and Sr). As demonstrated in Ref. [33], the two-electron exchange Coulomb integral
Rnp,ns,ns,np (n=3,4,5 for Mg, Ca, and Sr, respectively) determining the splitting between 3P o
1
and 1P o
1 states is very sensitive to many-body corrections. Indeed, with these corrections
included, the agreement with the experimental data improves to 1-2% for all the three atoms.
The case of the even-parity 3,1DJ -states is even more challenging. For Ca, these four states
are practically degenerate at the CI stage. A repulsion of the level 1D2 from the upper-lying
levels of np2 conﬁguration pushes it down to the level 3D2 and causes their strong mixing.
As seen from Table II these states are separated only by 10 cm−1, while the experimental
energy diﬀerence is 1550 cm−1. As a result, an accurate description of superposition of
3D2 and 1D2 states is important. The 3D2 – 1D2 splitting is restored when the many-body
corrections are included in the eﬀective Hamiltonian. These corrections properly account
for core polarization screening an interaction between sd and p2 conﬁgurations.

For Sr, the ﬁne-structure splittings of 3DJ states and energy diﬀerence between the 3DJ
and the 1D2 levels are also strongly underestimated in the pure CI method. Again the
inclusion of the many-body corrections substantially improves the splittings between the D-
states. It is worth emphasizing, that for such an accurate analysis a number of eﬀects was

4

taken into account, i.e., spin-orbit interaction, conﬁguration interaction, and core-valence
correlations. A proper account for all these eﬀects is of particular importance for determi-
nation of electric-dipole amplitudes forbidden in LS-coupling, such as for 3P o
J → 1S0, 1D2
transitions.

B. Transition amplitudes

In this section we present calculations of electric-dipole (E1) amplitudes for 3,1P o
1 → 1D2, 3P o

1 → 1S0,
3,1P o
1 → 3S1 transitions. The calculated reduced matrix
elements for Mg, Ca, and Sr are presented in Tables IV and V. For a transition I → F the
Einstein rate coeﬃcients for spontaneous emission (in 1/s) are expressed in terms of these
reduced matrix elements hF ||D||Ii (a.u.) and wavelengths λ (˚A) as

A number of long-range atom-atom interaction coeﬃcients could be directly obtained from
the calculated matrix elements. At large internuclear separations R an atom in a state |Ai
predominantly interacts with a like atom in a state |Bi through a potential V (R) ≈ ±C3/R3,
provided an electric-dipole transition between the two atomic states |Ai and |Bi is allowed.

where Ω is the conventionally deﬁned sum of projections of total angular momenta on in-
ternuclear axis.

From a solution of the eigen-value problem, Eq. (1), we obtained wave functions, con-
structed eﬀective dipole operators, and determined the transition amplitudes. The calcula-
tions were performed within both traditional conﬁguration-interaction method and CI cou-
pled with the many-body perturbation theory. The comparison of the CI and the CI+MBPT
values allows us to estimate an accuracy of our calculations. As it was mentioned above, to
monitor the consistency of the calculations, we determined the amplitudes using both length
and velocity gauges for the dipole operator. In general, dipole amplitudes calculated in the
velocity gauge are more sensitive to many-body corrections; we employ the length form of
the dipole operator in our ﬁnal tabulation.

We start the discussion with the amplitudes for the principal nsnp 1P o

1 → ns2 1S0 tran-
sitions (n = 3 for Mg, n = 4 for Ca, and n = 5 for Sr). Examination of Table IV reveals
that the many-body eﬀects reduce the L-gauge amplitudes by 1.6% for Mg, 5.5% for Ca,
and 6.4% for Sr. Further, the MBPT corrections bring the length and velocity-form results
into a closer agreement. For example, for Sr at the CI level the velocity and length forms
diﬀer by 2.7% and this discrepancy is reduced to 0.8% in the CI+MBPT calculations.

A dominant theoretical uncertainty of the employed CI+MBPT method is due to im-

possibility to account for all the orders of many-body perturbation theory.
emphasizing that in our CI calculations the basis sets were saturated and the associated
numerical errors were negligible. We expect that the theoretical uncertainty is proportional
to the determined many-body correction. In addition, we take into account the proximity
of the amplitudes obtained in the L- and V-gauges. We estimate the uncertainties for the

5

nsnp 1P o
length gauge. The ﬁnal values for hnsnp 1P o
work, are 4.03(2) for Mg, 4.91(7) for Ca, and 5.28(9) a.u. for Sr.

1 → ns2 1S0 transition amplitudes as 25–30% of the many-body corrections in the
1 ||D||ns2 1S0i, recommended from the present

We present a comparison of our results for hnsnp 1P o

1 ||D||ns2 1S0i with experimental data
in Table IV and in Fig. 1. Our estimated accuracy for Mg is a factor of three better than that
of the most accurate experiment and for Sr is comparable to experimental precision. For
Ca, the dipole matrix element of the 1P o
1 → 1S0 was recently determined with a precision of
0.2% by Zinner et al. [3] using photoassociation spectroscopy of ultracold Ca atoms. While
our result is in harmony with their value, the experimental accuracy is substantially better.
An updated analysis [40] of photoassociation spectra of Ref. [3] leads to a somewhat better
agreement with our calculated value.

A very extensive compilation of earlier theoretical results for the 1P o

1 → 1S0 transition
amplitudes can be found in Ref. [6] for Mg and in Ref. [9] for Ca. In a very recent mul-
ticonﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) calculations for Mg [7] the authors have determined
h3s3p 1P o
1 ||D||3s2 1S0i = 4.008 a.u. This value agrees with our ﬁnal result of 4.03(2) a.u.
For heavier Sr the correlation eﬀects are especially pronounced and only a few calculations
were performed. For example, MCHF calculations for Sr [8] found in the length gauge
h5s5p 1P o
1 ||D||5s2 1S0i = 5.67 a.u. By contrast to the present work, the core-polarization
eﬀects were not included in this analysis. As a result, this calculated value is in a good
agreement with our result 5.63 a.u. obtained at the CI stage, but diﬀers from the ﬁnal value
5.28(9) a.u.

Another nonrelativistically allowed transition is 1P o

1 → 1D2 and one could expect that
this amplitude can be determined with a good accuracy. For Mg this is really so. However,
for Ca and Sr an admixture of the conﬁguration p2 brings about large corrections to this
amplitude, especially in the velocity gauge. Another complication is the following. The
matrix element of electric-dipole operator can be represented in the V-gauge as (atomic
units ¯h = |e| = me = 1 are used):

hF |D|Ii = i c hF |α|Ii/(EI − EF ).

(5)

Here c is the speed of light, EI and EF are the energies of initial and ﬁnal states, and α
are the Dirac matrices. For the 1P o
1 → 1D2 transition in Ca and Sr the energy denominator
is approximately 0.01 a.u. Because the E1-amplitudes of these transitions ∼ 1 a.u. (see
Table IV), the respective numerators are of the order of 0.01 a.u. Correspondingly the matrix
elements hF |α|Ii are small and are very sensitive to corrections, i.e., the V-gauge results are
unstable. As a result we present only the L-gauge values for 1P o
1 → 1D2 E1 amplitudes for
Ca and Sr. An absence of reliable results in V-gauge hampers an estimate of the accuracy,
so we rather conservatively take it to be 25%. Note that even with such a large uncertainty
our value for Sr signiﬁcantly diﬀers from the experimental value [24]. The measurement in
[24] has been carried out on the 1D2 → 1S0 transition and an interference between electric-
quadrupole (E2) and Stark-induced dipole amplitudes was observed. In order to determine
the transition rate a theoretical value of the E2-amplitude for the 1D2 → 1S0 transition was
taken from [41]. It may be beneﬁcial either to measure directly the rate of the E1-transition
1P o

1 → 1D2 or to measure the rate of the E2-transition 1D2 → 1S0.
For the 3P o

J → 1S0, 1D2 transitions the respective E1-amplitudes are small; these are non-
relativistically forbidden intercombination transitions and consequently their amplitudes are
proportional to spin-orbit interaction. The calculated reduced matrix elements are presented
in Table V.

6

One can see from Tables I – III that the MBPT corrections to the ﬁne structure splittings
are large, amplifying signiﬁcance of higher order many-body corrections. In addition, higher
order corrections in the ﬁne-structure constant α to the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian are
also important here. As demonstrated in Ref. [6], the Breit interaction reduces the dipole
amplitude of 3P o
1 → 1S0 transition in Mg by 5%. At the same time for all the intercom-
bination transitions the agreement between L- and V-gauges is at the level of 6-8%. We
conservatively estimate the uncertainties of the calculated intercombination E1 amplitudes
to be 10–12%.

To reiterate, we carried out calculations of energies of low-lying levels and electric-dipole
amplitudes between them for divalent atoms Mg, Ca, and Sr. We employed ab initio rela-
tivistic conﬁguration interaction method coupled with many-body perturbation theory. The
calculated removal energies reproduce experimental values within 0.1-0.2%. A special em-
phasis has been put on accurate determination of electric-dipole amplitudes for principal
transitions nsnp 1P o
1 → ns2 1S0. For these transitions, we estimated theoretical uncertainty
to be 0.5% for Mg, 1.4% for Ca, and 1.7% for Sr. For Ca, the reduced matrix element
h4s4p 1P o
1 ||D||4s2 1S0i is in a good agreement with a high-precision experimental value [3].
An estimated uncertainty of the calculated lifetime of the lowest 1P o
1 state for Mg is a
factor of three smaller than that of the most accurate experiment. In addition, we evalu-
ated electric-dipole amplitudes and estimated theoretical uncertainties for 1P o
1 → 3S1, 1D2,
3P o
2 → 1D2 transitions. Our results could be useful in designs of
cooling schemes and atomic clocks, and for accurate description of long-range atom-atom
interactions needed in interpretation of cold-collision data.

The distorted-wave impulse approximation for
electron capture into excited states

Yiu Hong Ng and Jim McCann

Atomic and Molecular Physics Group †, Department of Physics, University of Durham,
Durham DH1 3LE, UK.

Abstract. Total cross sections for electron capture are calculated for collisions of
fast protons and α–particles with atomic hydrogen. The distorted-wave impulse
approximation is applied over the energy range 10–1500 keV/u. State-selective results
are given for the 1s, 2s and 2p levels. Both the post and prior forms of the
model are calculated and compared with results from other theories and experimental
measurements. In general the model performs very well in comparison with experiment
over this energy range though discrepancies arise at lower energies.

1.

Introduction

The study of the interaction between atomic hydrogen and fast ions has an important
role in the physics of fusion plasmas (Gilbody 1995). It is signiﬁcant also in other areas
of research such as the study of stellar atmospheres (Janev et al 1987) and the physics of
proton aurorae (Van Zyl 1993). An essential requirement for the study of these complex
phenomena is the availability of accurate data for a wide variety of fundamental ion-
atom collision processes. Given that the velocity range is such that we can consider
the nuclear motion as classical and solve the time-dependent equation of motion for the
electrons, one might suppose that simulations of these processes would be rather simple.
However this is not the case, and the theory behind this problem remains an area of
active investigation (Bransden and McDowell 1993). While diﬀerent strategies have been
applied to problems of this nature, the most common approach relies on basis function
expansions (Fritsch and Lin 1991, Kuang and Lin 1996, McLaughlin et al 1997). This
and other methods, including the the direct solution of the partial-diﬀerential equation,
have been reviewed comprehensively by Bransden and McDowell (1993).

While the basis function method has a well-founded popularity, it does have some
drawbacks. Firstly, it can be computationally expensive when excited-state coupling

2

is involved. Moreover the choice of basis set is problematic; one cannot always
rely on the use of larger basis sets to produce better data. Kuang and Lin (1996)
indicate some of the spurious eﬀects that can arise if the size and type of a basis
set are not appropriate.
In spite of these caveats, it is fair to say that recent large-
scale calculations of this type have given excellent agreement with experimental data
over the appropriate energy range (McLaughlin et al 1997). There exist limitations
to the method because it is primarily designed for strong diabatic coupling between
bound states which are nondegenerate. It tends to work less well for higher energies
at which ionization (continuum coupling) is prevalent, and when mixing with nearly
degenerate states takes place. While signiﬁcant advances have been made in the use
of pseudostates to simulate such coupling (Slim and Ermolaev 1994, McLaughlin et al
1997) the implementation of the method requires access to high-performance computers.
An innovation marrying bound and continuum states has been developed by Brown
and Crothers (1994, 1996a, 1996b) and includes continuum coupling explicitly in the
wavefunctions. This is known as the symmetrized variational continuum distorted-wave
(SVCDW) method and it gives excellent agreement with experimental data for electron
capture, excitation and ionization over the intermediate energy region.

Our paper is concerned with fundamental charge exchange processes, namely those
occurring between hydrogen atoms and fast protons or α–particles. Charge exchange
poses theoretical diﬃculties in that one requires an accurate description of the electron
dynamics around both the target and projectile. Often a large two-centre basis function
expansion is the prescription for achieving this aim, or a restricted optimized expansion
(Brown and Crothers 1994). Considering alternatives to these approaches, the fact that
charge exchange rapidly decreases in importance as the energy is increased means that
one can often use perturbation theory at high energies to obtain reliable predictions
(Belki´c et al 1979). This also has the advantage in being easy to calculate even
with modest computational resources. However, reﬁnements of perturbation theory,
including second-Born type corrections, are much more diﬃcult to compute and often
do not improve the agreement with experiment (Bransden and McDowell 1993). This
paper investigates the eﬀectiveness of extending one such high-energy approximation
into an intermediate energy regime. Here we understand the term intermediate energy
to refer to the range 10-200 keV/u, and this is the range of greatest interest for beam
injection techniques used in fusion science (Gilbody 1995). The method we adopt, the
distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA), though based upon perturbation theory
can account for high-order potential scattering from both centres. However the theory
is not of the close-coupling type and thus in its present form cannot describe strong
intrashell (Stark) mixing or backcoupling (McCann 1992).

The DWIA was formulated (Miraglia 1982) as an improvement upon the conventional
plane-wave impulse approximation (PWIA) for electron capture in ion-atom collisions.

The PWIA is designed to work for collisions in which the collision is fast in terms of the
atomic time-scales (projectile or target). The validity for the impulse approximation
depends upon the collision time being much shorter than some characteristic orbital
period of the electron bound state. This prerequisite comes from treating the weaker
interacting nucleus as a spectator particle.
If the collision is suﬃciently fast on the
atomic time-scale of this particle then the spectator particle cannot interact strongly
with the electron during the transition. Its role is conﬁned to describing the electronic
state before or after the supposed three-body interaction in terms of binding the electron
and providing it with a momentum distribution in the bound state. This establishes a
loose validity criterion for the approximation that the collision time should be shorter
than the internal interaction time, or in other words, the atomic orbital period.
In
applications the impulse approximation was found to be very eﬀective in reproducing
a large variety of experimental data for very fast collisions (Jakubassa-Amundsen and
Amundsen 1980). However the inherent asymmetry of the method leads to post and
prior forms of the transition amplitude;
in general these do not agree well. The
two versions of the approximation converge at high energies, but strongly diverge at
intermediate and low energies. On the other hand the DWIA seems to be better suited to
both symmetric and asymmetric collisions. While we ﬁnd that there is still a post-prior
discrepancy, it is very much less than that which arises from using the PWIA. We employ
this model to investigate the following collision processes

H+ + H(1s) → H(1s, 2s, 2p) + H+

and

He2+ + H(1s) → He+(1s, 2s, 2p) + H+.

These are ideal processes to test any theory because the atomic structure is trivial. Also
the absence of screening eﬀects allows us to write continuum states in terms of Coulomb
functions. For this reason the evaluation of matrix elements is straightforward.

2. Method

In this three-body re-arrangement reaction, we have a bare projectile nucleus of charge
ZP travelling at a velocity v relative to the target atom which has nuclear charge ZT .
The position of the electron in question, with respect to the target and projectile nuclei,
is deﬁned to be rT and rP , respectively. The initial and ﬁnal atomic energies of the
electron are denoted by ET and EP , corresponding to the target and projectile state
electron wavefunctions Φi and Φf . The momentum-space representations of these states
are labelled as ˜Φi and ˜Φf in this paper.

The deﬁnitions of post and prior can lead to confusion so let us clarify their meanings.
We use the standard convention that post refers to using the impulse approximation in

4

the initial channel for the interaction between the projectile ion and target atom. In
order to calculate the prior form, a separate program must be written.

For the purposes of our calculation we have considered transitions between excited
target states and the projectile ground state. One can always relate the data obtained to
the inverse reaction using the principle of detailed balance and time-reversal symmetry,
i.e. cross sections for the processes (1) and (2) can be elicited by looking at their
time-reversed counterparts:

and

H+ + H(1s, 2s, 2p) → H(1s) + H+

H+ + He+(1s, 2s, 2p) → He2+ + H(1s).

In our calculations we have therefore explicitly considered electron capture into the 1s
state from the 1s, 2s and 2px,y,z states. From now on, we will discuss calculations in
terms of the prior form only, for the sake of convenience.

2.1.

2s-1s transition

Previous work using the DWIA (Gravielle and Miraglia 1988) dealt with electron capture
from the K shell, speciﬁcally 1s-1s electron transfer. It was noted (McCann 1992) that
the evaluation of the azimuthal integral, with the polar axis lying along the momentum
transfer vector µ, generates an Appell function F1 (Appell and Kamp´e de Feriet 1926)
which is a hypergeometric function of two variables. Its many linear transformations and
analytic continuations (Olsson 1964) can be used to evaluate this function. Nevertheless
it remains a major obstacle to eﬃcient and accurate computation of the capture cross
section.

For the case of 2s-1s electron transfer, it can easily be shown using parametric
diﬀerentiation that the spatial integrals, (7) and (8), over rT and rP simplify in a manner
very similar to that found in the 1s-1s symmetric transfer calculation (McCann 1992).
Using spherical coordinates for the k–integral in (6), we denote the angles between µ
and k, and that between µ and v by θµk and θµv. Taking the angle between these two
planes as φ, we then encounter the following term:

dφ (A + B cos φ)−2(C + D cos φ)−1−iaP = 2π(A + B)−2(C + D)−1−iaP

2; 2, 1 + iaP ; 1; x1, x2)
with x1 = 2B/(A + B) and x2 = 2D/(C + D). The quantities A, B, C and D have the
deﬁnitions:

(14)

×F1( 1

A = Z 2

P + v2 + k2 − 2vk cos θµk cos θµv

B = 2vk sin θµk sin θµv
C = −∆E + v2/2 − vk cos θµk cos θµv
D = vk sin θµk sin θµv

2.2.

2p-1s transition

The lack of spherical symmetry for the 2p sub-states means that the choice of the axis of
quantization is important (Coleman and Trelease 1968). Using the momentum transfer
vector µ as the polar axis simpliﬁes calculations and the change to the laboratory frame
of reference requires a simple rotation transformation.

A diﬀerent line of approach takes advantage of parametric diﬀerentiation. We can

consider the spherical harmonics in their real form:

Φ2pj (rT ) = 1

4Z 5/2

T (2π)−1/2 exp(−λT rT ) rT j

where λT = 1

2ZT and j ∈ {x, y, z}. In evaluating (7), integration by parts gives:
c = I1 + I2

µ consists of two mutually orthogonal components, with one running parallel to the

transverse component is −η and this lies within the xy-plane. It is then convenient to
let η lie along the x(y)-axis with the result that capture from the 2py(x) state is parity

For electron capture from the 2p states, the azimuthal integral of (6) has the form:

Parametric diﬀerentiation transforms (22) into an expression containing derivatives

of the more familiar Appell functions F1.

we therefore have:

− F1( 1

2; 1, 1 + iaP ; 1; x1, x2) (A′ + B′)(E′ + F ′)}

As with 1s-1s electron capture, the corresponding 2s-1s and 2p-1s transition amplitudes
possess two singularities, at C ±D = 0 and C ′±D′ = 0 respectively, which are integrable.

2.3. Symmetric models

In the DWIA we inevitably have a post-prior asymmetry.
If there is an inherent
asymmetry in the reaction, for example ZT ≫ ZP , the choice between post and prior
models can be argued in favour of one or the other. A detailed discussion of this
question is given in the next section. A merit of the CDW theory is the intrinsic post-
prior equivalence. Symmetry can be artiﬁcially introduced in our model by averaging
the post and prior amplitudes. The resulting symmetrized DWIA is given by:

˜aS
f i(η) ≡ 1
2 h

˜a(−)
f i (η) + ˜a(+)

f i (η)

i
Miraglia (1982) had also proposed making the impulse approximation in both entry and
exit channels (generalized impulse approximation GIA). While it is much more diﬃcult
to calculate the GIA, it is not clear whether this GIA model will have a larger range of
validity than the DWIA, and thus whether it oﬀers a substantial gain in accuracy.

3. Results and discussion

We present results for capture cross sections as a function of energy and compare this
data with experiment and other models. For the most part we use logarithmic graphs,
but in addition we have compiled a small sample of the data in tabular form for reference
purposes (tables 1 and 2). This helps to form detailed comparison of the post and prior
forms of the DWIA results which would not be apparent from the graphs. We have
used the CDW model as a benchmark (Belki´c et al 1979) for the results. This model
reproduces electron capture data very well over the high-energy range but suﬀers from
a lack of unitarity at lower energies and invariably produces gross overestimates for
capture at intermediate energies.

In ﬁgure 1 the DWIA results for electron capture cross sections of the 1s-2s transition
in reaction (1) are shown. The corresponding data of Brown and Crothers (1996a) have
not been presented, although they follow the experimental results very closely, even
down to 10 keV/u. Instead our results are compared with experimental data and the
continuum distorted-wave (CDW) results over the intermediate energy range: 20–250
keV/u. At the upper end of the energy regime we note that both DWIA curves merge
with the CDW results. However this convergence is not uniform. If we refer to table 1
for energies beyond the scope of the graph, apart from noting the sharp fall in the size
of the cross section (σ2s), it is clear that at very high energies the post and prior results
converge but begin to depart from the CDW data. This can be understood from noting

9

the importance of second-order eﬀects at these energies. The CDW theory can partly
but not fully account for these eﬀects, and the DWIA data are more reliable estimates
in this case. Nonetheless the CDW results are more than adequate for good estimates of
cross sections at high energies.

The intermediate energy range covered by ﬁgure 1 indicates the disparity of these
models more clearly. The CDW results continue rising sharply as is well-known (Belki´c et
al 1979). This is typical of the diﬃculties in applying high-energy perturbation theory
over the intermediate energy range. We note that DWIA gives a slight improvement over
CDW below around 50 keV/u, although its accord with experiment remains poor at lower
energies. Furthermore the post and prior DWIA models show large diﬀerences below 50
keV/u. In common with the PWIA, the inherent post-prior asymmetry is expected to be
greatest at the lowest velocities. As a general rule, the discrepancy is worse for PWIA
than for DWIA (Ng and McCann 1997).

On theoretical grounds we can propose a prescription for the energy range of validity
of the DWIA and for the preferred form (post or prior) of the theory in this particular
reaction. Using the peaking criterion (McCann 1992), the orbital velocity of the electron
in the ﬁnal state is smaller than that in the initial state, and so one should apply CDW
reﬁnements in the exit channel and allow the PWIA to take account of momentum spread
in the entrance channel. This implies that the post form should be preferred. Next, one
can use the impulse hypothesis (Gravielle and Miraglia 1988) to establish the energy
limit - given the largest orbital velocity is 1 a.u. the desired stipulation would be that
E ≫ 25 keV/u. This inequality is consistent with the experimental data in ﬁgure 1.
Since we wish to know the practical limits of our model, the important question here is:
how strong is the inequality? In this paper we aim to answer this question by a mixture
of comparisons with experiment and other theories.

We have also computed, for the sake of completeness, several results using the
symmetrized DWIA (equation 26). The results are shown in ﬁgure 1 and give the best
agreement of all the calculations. Nonetheless this averaging procedure seems rather
artiﬁcial to us, and the presence of a large post-prior discrepancy at the lower energies
indicates that neither the post nor the prior form is very satisfactory around 25 keV/u.
On the whole the theory of Brown and Crothers (1996a) still appears to be the most
satisfactory description of the process both in physical and quantitative terms.

Figure 2 shows capture cross sections for 1s-2p transition. Below 40 keV/u, DWIA
again gives slightly better results than CDW. In the high-energy range the results do
not converge. Both sets of DWIA results diﬀer and they in turn are lower than the CDW
results by a fairly constant ratio (table 2). Again the post DWIA is expected to be the
best physical model for this process and this is conﬁrmed by the better agreement with
the SVCDW of Brown and Crothers (1996a) over the energy range 20–100 keV/u. It has
been noted that the experimental results all have systematic uncertainties with regard

10

to the normalization of the data. However these uncertainties are not large and a series
of experiments has been carried out on this reaction process using independent estimates
of the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections. It is very likely the experimental data
in the ﬁgure are reliable both in terms of the energy dependence and absolute values.
In any case we have not attempted to renormalize the data to theoretical predictions.

The process (1) is dominated by 1s and 2s transitions above 100 keV/u. For
higher energies we can estimate capture into higher excited states (σn) by the rough
approximation based on the n−3-distribution of populations. The total cross section
therefore becomes σtotal = σ1 + 1.62σ2 where σ1 and σ2 are cross sections of capture into
the n = 1 and n = 2 levels respectively. Results for DWIA and CDW, in the energy range
125–2500 keV/u (ﬁgure 3), are very similar and are in good agreement with experimental
data.

The proton-hydrogen collision calculations do not contain much post-prior
discrepancies due to the nature of the charge exchange process being more or less
symmetric. Their agreement with experimental data is very satisfactory. However the
study of reaction (2) which has a strong in-built asymmetry would provide a much clearer
critical assessment of DWIA. But ﬁrst, the nature and implication of the asymmetry must
be considered with care.

Generally in electron transfers from the ground state to one which is excited, an
important point to consider is the momentum spread of the electron, before and after
the collision. A sharply peaked momentum spread could be treated more eﬃciently
by CDW with its peaking approximation. The impulse approximation should then be
applied to the electronic state with the less sharply peaked momentum distribution.
The momentum spread can be aﬀected by the electron’s distance from the nucleus and
also by the magnitude of the nuclear charge, and is roughly of the order of ∼ Z/n.
Since the only asymmetry in proton-hydrogen collision comes from the diﬀerence in
initial and ﬁnal states and not from projectile and target nuclear charges, its post-prior
discrepancies are not appreciable. The same, however, cannot be said for (2). In the
forward reaction, we would expect an electron attached to the heavier (projectile) α–
particle to have quite a broad momentum distribution. Since this situation arises after
the collision, it would seem reasonable to use the prior form of DWIA. The prior form
corresponds to a PWIA wavefunction in the exit channel, making the bare proton of
the hydrogen atom more of a spectator particle than the helium nucleus. It has been
argued (Gravielle and Miraglia 1991) that the converse should be true, the argument
being based upon the idea of associating the impulse approximation with the stronger
potential (i.e. in the entrance channel). We take the opposite viewpoint as the weight of
evidence presented in this paper lends it suﬃcient support. Consequently for the time-
reversed reaction (13), we apply inversion so that its post form becomes favourable.

Cross sections for selected energies for reaction (2) are tabulated in table 2, the

11

energy range (7–200 keV/u) being the same as that covered by ﬁgures 4 and 5. These
show cross sections of capture into the 2s and 2p states. Comparison is made with
the symmetrized variational continuum distorted-wave (SVCDW) method (Brown and
Crothers 1996b), the conventional CDW theory and experimental results. In the case of
the 2s transition DWIA fares rather poorly. While the curves follow the SVCDW curve
at higher energies and avoids the low-energy divergence of the CDW, the agreement
with experiment is not good over the important plateau region (ﬁgure 4). The DWIA
completely fails to describe this feature. Results for the 2p transition (ﬁgure 5) on the
other hand are less conclusive. The shortcomings of the DWIA around 50 keV/u for the
2s results could be attributed to the lack of strong coupling between the resonant states
(H-1s, He+-2s, 2p). Although the DWIA underestimates the 2s cross sections (ﬁgure
4) and overestimates the 2p results (ﬁgure 5), this can be explained by a second-order
process involving the redistribution of populations: H(1s) → He+(2p) → He+(2s). The
inclusion of this eﬀect in the SVCDW model brought good agreement with experiment.
Its neglect in the DWIA means that there is a disconcerting gap between theory and
experiment in ﬁgure 4, with a fraction of the cross section that should have gone towards
the 2s transition ending up in the 2p instead.

The total cross section for capture into all states is shown in ﬁgure 6. The DWIA
prior curve, with the n−3 scaling law included, performs remarkably well against both
SVCDW and CDW. Major contribution to the total cross section comes from capture into
the 2p state and DWIA models this quite well in its prior form, yielding good results.
The use of the 1s, 2s, 2p results to extrapolate for capture to all states is doubtful, of
course. A simple test shows that when the n−3 scaling law is applied to obtain CDW
results for σn (n > 2), it underestimates the true CDW σn in the energy range 7–200
keV/u. This has the eﬀect that the extrapolation can be in error by as much as 60% . In
view of this, DWIA results for total cross sections should be considered as underestimates
for capture to excited states and this could explain part of the shortfall between theory
and experiment that we see in ﬁgure 6. If we were to assume that the underestimation
for CDW will be of the same order of magnitude for DWIA at a ﬁxed energy, appropriate
augmentation of the results would bring them quite close to the experimental values.

4. Conclusions

In conclusion, despite its inherent post-prior discrepancies, DWIA can perform well even
at energies as low as 20 keV/u if suﬃcient care is taken in choosing whether to use
the post or prior form of the theory. This is very useful in establishing the energy
range of validity. However the computational eﬀort in evaluating DWIA is much greater
than either CDW or PWIA model; hours as opposed to seconds on one of our RS/6000
workstations. The additional eﬀort brings its reward in terms of better estimates of cross

12

sections towards the upper end of the intermediate energy range. This does provide very
useful data for applications. There are awkward features of the calculation that make
it diﬃcult to compute without careful attention. However the method is signiﬁcantly
less expensive to compute than large-scale close-coupling methods, though it does not
give the same accuracy or reliability over the intermediate energy regime. It is diﬃcult
to extend the DWIA method further. One might attempt a close-coupling approach akin
to the SVCDW method. We take the view that signiﬁcant improvements are diﬃcult
within the DWIA framework and that instead the SVCDW approach seems to combine
the correct physical and mathematical features of the charge transfer processes in an
elegant manner. This approach seems the most promising avenue for future work.

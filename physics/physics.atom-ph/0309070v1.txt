A search for a sidereal annual variation in the frequency diﬀerence between co-located 129Xe and
3He Zeeman masers sets a stringent limit on boost-dependent Lorentz and CPT violation involving
the neutron, consistent with no eﬀect at the level of 10−27 GeV.

Invariance of the laws of nature under transformations
between inertial reference frames that diﬀer in relative ve-
locity (“boosts”) is an essential feature of Lorentz sym-
metry, along with invariance under rotations. Experi-
mental tests of boost invariance, such as the Kennedy-
Thorndike experiment [1], have been performed for many
years with increasing precision [2]. These experiments
typically search for a variation of the velocity of light
with the laboratory velocity and test boost invariance in
the context of classical electrodynamics. However, the
fundamental role of Lorentz symmetry in physics makes
it desirable to test boost invariance for other systems,
such as massive particles with spin.

In this Letter, we present a high-sensitivity experimen-
tal test of boost invariance for the neutron, which we in-
terpret in the context of a general extension of the Stan-
dard Model of particle physics. Our experiment consists
of long-term monitoring of the frequency of co-located
3He and 129Xe Zeeman masers as the Earth rotates and
revolves around the Sun. We search for a speciﬁc signa-
ture of a violation of boost invariance: an annual vari-
ation of the nuclear Zeeman splitting, modulated at the
frequency of the Earth’s sidereal rotation. Such an eﬀect
could arise from Lorentz- and CPT-violating couplings
of the 3He and 129Xe nuclear spins (each largely deter-
mined by a valence neutron) that depend on the instan-
taneous velocity (magnitude and direction) of the labo-
ratory. The appeal of the noble-gas maser experiment is
the excellent absolute frequency stability [3, 4, 5], and
thus the sensitivity to small, slow variations in spin cou-
plings.

theoretical

A general

framework known as

the
Standard-Model Extension (SME) has been developed
in recent years to allow a comprehensive and system-
atic study of the implications of Lorentz violation at
observable energies [6]. The SME describes arbitrary
coordinate-independent Lorentz violation. Since viola-
tion of CPT symmetry (the product of Charge conju-
gation, Parity inversion, and Time reversal) must come
with Lorentz violation [7], the SME also incorporates
general CPT violation. Observable Lorentz and CPT vi-
olation could be a remnant of Planck-scale physics. One

attractive origin is spontaneous Lorentz breaking in a
fundamental theory [8], but other sources are possible
[9].

The SME provides a context for the interpretation and
comparison of experimental measurements of Lorentz
and CPT violation, including in mesons [10], photons
[2, 11], and leptons [12, 13, 14]. In particular, atomic-
clock comparisons [15, 16] of the kind used in the boost-
symmetry test presented here have provided some of the
most stringent tests of rotation invariance and hence of
Lorentz and CPT symmetry for the neutron [5] and the
proton [17].

We refer the reader to previous publications [3, 4, 5]
for details on the design and operation of our two-species
(3He and 129Xe) noble-gas Zeeman maser. Here, we pro-
vide a brief review. Co-located ensembles of 129Xe and
3He atoms at pressures of hundreds of mbar are held
in a double-chamber glass cell placed in a homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1.5 G. Both species have spin-1/2
nuclei and the same sign nuclear magnetic dipole mo-
ment, but no higher-order electric or magnetic nuclear

the noble gas atoms are nuclear-spin-polarized by spin-
exchange collisions with optically-pumped Rb vapor [18].
The noble gas atoms diﬀuse into the second chamber,
which is surrounded by an inductive circuit that is reso-
nant both at the 3He and 129Xe Zeeman frequencies (4.9
kHz and 1.7 kHz, respectively). For a suﬃciently high
ﬂux of population-inverted nuclear magnetization, active
maser oscillation of both species can be maintained in-
deﬁnitely.

Due to the generally weak interactions of noble gas
atoms with the walls and during atomic collisions, the
3He and 129Xe ensembles can have long Zeeman coher-
ence (T2) times ∼ hundreds of seconds. It is thus possible
to achieve excellent absolute frequency stability with one
of the noble-gas masers by using the second maser as a
co-magnetometer. For example, Zeeman frequency mea-
surements with sensitivity of ∼ 100 nHz are possible with
averaging intervals of about an hour [4]. This two-species
noble gas maser can also serve as a sensitive NMR gyro-
scope [19]: the above quoted frequency stability implies

a rotation sensitivity of 0.13 degree/hour.

Using this device, we recently placed a bound on a set
of SME coeﬃcients deﬁned with respect to an inertial ref-
erence frame based on the Earth [5]; i.e., we constrained
the possible rotation-violating couplings of the neutron
spin. Here, we choose a Sun-based inertial reference
frame, which allows us to study cleanly — for the ﬁrst
time in the fermion sector of the SME — the symmetry
of spacetime with respect to boost transformations. (The
pioneering work of Berglund et al. [16] is sensitive to a
mixture of boost and rotation eﬀects.) The experiment’s
rest frame moves with the Earth around the Sun at a ve-
locity v⊕/c = β⊕ ≃ 9.9 × 10−5, and the Lorentz transfor-
mation that describes the change of coordinates from the
laboratory frame to the Sun-based frame includes both
a rotation and a boost. Thus the possible Lorentz- and
CPT-violating couplings of noble-gas spins would result
in a daily sidereal modulation of the maser frequency,
whereas the portion of the couplings that arises from the
boost transformation would induce a sinusoidal variation
of the daily modulation amplitude over the course of the
sidereal year [20] as a consequence of the motion of the
Earth around the Sun. We note that the boost-violation
sensitivity of such an experiment, with the quantization
axis ﬁxed in the Earth-based laboratory frame, is in-
evitably reduced by a factor of β⊕ with respect to the
rotation-violation sensitivity. To interpret the results of
our maser experiments, we follow the conventions of Ref.
[21], Appendix C, and relate the maser frequency to the
various SME coeﬃcients for Lorentz and CPT violation.
We choose a set of laboratory coordinates (t, x, y, z)
such that the ˆx axis points south, the ˆy axis points east,
and the ˆz axis points vertically upwards in the labora-
tory [22]. With the reasonable approximation that the
orbit of the Earth is circular, the rotation from the Sun-
centered celestial equatorial frame to the standard labo-
ratory frame is given by

In this equation, j = x, y, z = 1, 2, 3 denotes the spatial

notes the spatial index in the Sun-centered frame using
celestial equatorial coordinates. The Earth’s sidereal an-
gular rotation frequency is ω⊕ ≃ 2π/(23 h 56 min), and
χ ≃ 47.6◦ is the colatitude of the laboratory, located in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. The time T⊕ is measured in
the Sun-centered frame from the beginning of the sidereal
day, which begins when the ˆy and ˆY axes align.

Here, Ω⊕ is the angular frequency of the Earth’s orbital
motion. The time T is measured by a clock at rest at
the origin, with T = 0 taken at 2:35 a.m. (U.S. Eastern
Standard Time), March 20, 2000 [23]. The angle be-
tween the XY celestial equatorial plane and the Earth’s
orbital plane is η = 23.4◦. The magnitude of the lab-
oratory’s velocity due to the rotation of the Earth is
βL = r⊕ω⊕ sin χ/c ≃ 1.1 10−6, where r⊕ is the Earth’s
radius.

In the context of the SME, our noble-gas masers are
sensitive to Lorentz and CPT violation controlled by the
coeﬃcients bΛ, dΛΣ, HΛΣ, and gΛΣΓ [24]. These coeﬃ-
cients are considered to be static and uniform in the Sun
frame, at least over the course of a solar year, and they
couple to the 3He and 129Xe nuclear spins. The corre-
sponding coeﬃcients in the laboratory frame acquire a
time dependence due both to the Earth’s rotation and to
its revolution around the Sun. Since the SME is observer
Lorentz covariant, direct Lorentz transformations yield
the coeﬃcients in the laboratory frame.

For instance, the combination of SME coeﬃcients to

which our masers are most sensitive is

˜b2 = b2 − m d20 + m g310 − H31,

where m is the mass of the neutron. To ﬁrst order in

where ˜bJ and αss, αsc, . . . are combinations of SME co-
eﬃcients deﬁned in Table I and in Ref. [25], Appendix
B. We note that Eq. (4) allows one to distinguish the
eﬀects of the Earth’s rotation alone (terms proportional
to ˜bX and ˜bY ) from eﬀects due to the combination of the
Earth’s rotation and revolution, which are suppressed by
four orders of magnitude because of the factor β⊕.

In our boost-symmetry test, the 129Xe maser was
used as a co-magnetometer to stabilize the magnetic
ﬁeld, which was oriented along the y axis (i.e., east-
west). The leading Lorentz-violating frequency vari-
ation of the free-running 3He maser was proportional
δνHe = k (˜b2 − 0.0034 ˜d2 + 0.0034˜gd), where
to ˜b2:
k = −8.46 1032 nHz/GeV [24]. The SME coeﬃcients
˜d2, ˜gd are deﬁned in Ref. [24] and produce time variation
similar to that of ˜b2 in Eq. (4). However, their eﬀect on
δνHe is reduced by a factor ∼ 10−3 relative to ˜b2, so we
neglect their dependence on β⊕.

As discussed in [5], we acquired noble-gas maser data
in four diﬀerent runs spread over about 13 months. See
Fig. 1. Each run lasted about 20 days, and we reversed
the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld after the ﬁrst ∼ 10
days in each run to help distinguish possible Lorentz-
violating eﬀects from diurnal systematic variations. Ta-
ble II lists, for each run, the mean values determined for
the amplitude of sidereal-day modulations of the 3He-
maser frequency due to Lorentz-violating coeﬃcients in
the ˆX and ˆY directions (Sun-centered frame):

δνHe = δνX sin ω⊕T⊕ + δνY cos ω⊕T⊕.

where

δνX = k (αs + β⊕(αss sin Ω⊕T + αsc cos Ω⊕T )),
δνY = k (αc + β⊕(αcs sin Ω⊕T + αcc cos Ω⊕T )).

For each run, δνX and δνY correspond to a very good
approximation to a single high-precision measurement of

time Tj.

Next, we ﬁtted the values of δνX , δνY , and Tj in Table
II to Eq. (6), thus obtaining the ﬁt parameters reported
in Table I and shown graphically in Fig. (1), and the cor-
responding bounds on the SME coeﬃcients of Table III.
We treated all ﬁt parameters as independent and we ex-
tracted energy bounds for SME coeﬃcients disregarding
the possibility of accidental mutual cancellations. This
analysis yielded no signiﬁcant violation of boost invari-
ance, with a limit of about 150 nHz on the magnitude
of an annual modulation of the sidereal variation in the
3He-maser frequency.

To conﬁrm that our result is consistent with the null
hypothesis (i.e., no Lorentz-violating eﬀect), we per-
formed two checks. First, we generated 10, 000 faux
3He-maser data sets including sidereal-frequency varia-
tions drawn from a normal distribution of zero mean,
but with standard errors for δνX and δνX at each time
Tj equal to the corresponding values found in the experi-
ment. For each faux data set, we calculated the χ2 of the
ﬁt to Eq. (6), and found that the value χ2 = 0.30 from
the real experimental data is highly probable for a sys-
tem in which there is no sidereal modulation of the 3He
maser frequency at the experiment’s level of sensitivity.
In the second check, we performed a series of F tests to
estimate the probabilities that the values of the ﬁt pa-
rameters, determined from the maser data, arise entirely
from statistical ﬂuctuations. For all ﬁt parameters, the
F tests yielded probabilities greater than 30%; whereas
it is customary to consider that a ﬁt parameter is signif-

is smaller than 5% or 1%.

We performed a series of checks for systematic eﬀects,
including sidereal-day and -year variations in maser tem-
perature and signal amplitude (e.g., driven by variations
in the optical-pumping laser). Temperature ﬂuctuations
in the 3He and 129Xe resonant detection circuit can in-
duce small maser-frequency shifts. Accurate tempera-
ture monitoring over the course of the 13-month exper-
iment showed a maximum 1.6 mK sidereal-day varia-
tion of maser temperature, corresponding to a maximum
sidereal-day 3He-maser frequency modulation of about 4
nHz, which is an order of magnitude smaller than our
statistical sensitivity. A careful analysis of the maser
amplitude showed a lack of phase coherence in sidereal-
day modulations over the 13-month data set, and hence
an insigniﬁcant systematic sidereal-year variation in the
3He-maser frequency.

In conclusion, we used co-located 3He and 129Xe Zee-
man masers to perform a high-sensitivity search for a vi-
olation of boost invariance of the neutron. We found no
signiﬁcant sidereal annual variation in the free-running
3He-maser frequency at a level of approximately 150
nHz. This result places a bound of about 10−27 GeV on
11 previously unexplored coeﬃcients among the 44 co-
eﬃcients describing possible leading-order Lorentz- and
CPT-violating couplings of the neutron. Signiﬁcant im-
provements may be possible with a 21Ne/3He Zeeman
maser [26], with masers located on a rotating table [27],
or with space-based clocks [28].

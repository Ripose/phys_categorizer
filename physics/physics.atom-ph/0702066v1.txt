ABSTRACT

Accurate ab initio calculations have been carried out to study the valence electron
removal energies and oscillator strengths of astrophysically important electromag-
netic transitions of quadruply ionized vanadium, V 4+. Many important electron
correlations are considered to all-orders using the relativistic coupled-cluster the-
ory. Calculated ionization potentials and ﬁne structure splittings are compared
with the experimental values, wherever available. To our knowledge, oscillator
strengths of electric dipole transitions are predicted for the ﬁrst time for most of
the transitions. The transitions span in the range of ultraviolet, visible and near
infrared regions and are important for astrophysical observations.

Introduction

Vanadium (V) is very important constituent in the atmosphere of dwarf stars (Kirkpatrick et al.

1999) as it condenses into solid solution with Ti-bearing condensates (as observed in mete-
orites) and not as pure vanadium oxide (V2O5) as commonly assumed. Abundance of V in its
ionic or molecular form is used to constrain temperature (Lodders 2002) at the dwarf transi-
tion. The abundance of V has been seen for 46 normal stars of spectral types from G8 to M0,
and their accurate estimates depend on the precise evaluation of transition amplitudes. This
abundance is very important in Sun (Bonsack 1959) and the observed maximum abundance
among similar stars declines with surface temperature. The abundance excesses of this odd
Z element by 1.2 dex in the hot peculiar star, like ‘star 3 cen A’, has very interesting and
important applications in astrophysics (Cowley & Wahlgern 2002). The transition between
low-lying energy levels is also of importance to the identiﬁcation of V emission lines in solar

– 2 –

spectra. Spectroscopic studies of this multi-charged ion are important in numerous applica-
tions in laser and plasma physics apart from astrophysics, like, the operations of short-wave
laser plasma, plasma diagnostics etc (Vainshtein et al. 1986).

The dominant conﬁguration to the ground state of quadruply ionized vanadium (V 4+)
is [Ar]3d3/2 (2D3/2), with strong correlations from 3d orbitals. This is unlike the isoelectronic
2S1/2). Experimental
neutral potassium (K), whose ground state is dominated by [Ar]4s1/2 (
ionization potentials (IP) of ground and excited states of this ion (Deurzen 1977) are tab-
ulated in the NIST web database (NIST website reference). The comparison highlights the
eﬀective considerations of quantum many-body theories, especially the correlation contribu-
tions applied to evaluate these energy eigenstates. There is no line strength estimation among
diﬀerent low lying states obtained from the change of outer most valence orbitals of V 4+ to
our knowledge. For few transitions, preliminary semi-empirical results are available wherein
experimental energies had been used to calculate oscillator strengths (Malinovskaya et al.
1992).

Here we have employed the relativistic coupled cluster method with single and double
excitations (RCCSD). This is one of the most powerful highly correlated approaches due to its
all order behavior for the correlation operator (Lindgren and Morrison 1985). The all order
behavior comes from the generation of correlated RCCSD states using exponential structure
of the cluster operators over the Dirac-Fock (DF) reference states (Coester 1958), which is
explicitly explained in our recent paper (Sahoo et al. 2004). The contributions due to Breit
interaction (Breit 1929) which is four orders smaller than the Coulomb interaction have been
neglected. For a univalent atomic system a set of coupled equations for the cluster operators,
Tn, may be obtained from the Bloch equations for core and valence electrons separately
(Lindgren and Morrison 1985; Debasish et al. 1989). Because of this consideration, though
the cluster operators are only of single and double excitations kind, their combinations can
produce partial triple excitations which nominate the method as coupled cluster method with
single, double and partial triple excitations (CCSD(T)). Contributions from these partial
excitations in the ionization potentials (IPs) for other systems are well known (Bartlett 1989);
this technique has been described extensively in one of our recent papers (Sahoo et al. 2004).
Therefore, it can take into account of diﬀerent electron correlations, like core correlation,
core polarization and pair correlation, eﬀects exhaustively for speciﬁc type of excitations
(Sahoo et al. 2004).

The oscillator strength for a transition from |Ψii to |Ψf i is

ff i =

∆Ef i × |Df i|2

2
3gi

(1)

where ∆Ef i is the energy diﬀerence between ﬁnal and initial states and gi = 2Ji + 1 is the

– 3 –

degeneracy factor of the initial state with angular momentum Ji. The electric dipole moment
matrix element Df i is deﬁned as

where,

Df i =

hΨf |d|Ψii
phΨf |Ψf iphΨi|Ψii

hΨf |d|Ψii = hΦf |eT †

f deTi|Φii

(2)

(3)

d= e~r is the electric dipole moment operator in the length (L) gauge form.
|Φis’ are the
DF reference states. Similarly, transition matrix elements can be obtained by replacing
d in velocity gauge form (Lin 1978; W. R. Johnson et al. 2002). The connected parts of
this expression will contribute and hence we only compute those parts in our dipole matrix
element calculations.

In the astrophysical literature, one uses weighted oscillator strength which is the product
of degeneracy of the initial state and the oscillator strength and is symmetric with respect
to initial and ﬁnal states. i.e.,

gf = (2Ji + 1)fif = −(2Jf + 1)ff i.

2. Results and Discussion

We have started with the generation of DF orbitals constructed as linear combination
of Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs), given by Chaudhuri et al. (R.K. Chaudhuri et al. 2000).
The number of single particle orbital bases are chosen for diﬀerent symmetries based on
the number of occupied orbitals and requirement of the transitions of interest. All the core
orbitals are considered active in our calculations to make correlations more exhaustive, es-
pecially the core correlation part. Table I shows the excitation energies and ﬁne structure
splittings of many low lying states with single unﬁlled orbitals of V 4+. For ionization poten-
tials, we ﬁnd very good agreement with the experimental data obtained from NIST database
(NIST website reference) for all the cases. Leaving out the 3d5/2 state which has rather low
binding energy, the average deviation from the experimental values are about 0.1%. The
experimental uncertainty of the allowed transition wavelengths in the NIST values are very
small, at the level of 2nd to 3rd decimal places, which are of the order 10 cm−1 in excitation
energies. The ﬁne-structure splittings are of the same order. Therefore, it is important to
do higher precession experiments for ﬁne-structure splittings.

The oscillator strength for transitions between diﬀerent energy states depend linearly
on energy, and quadratically on the electric dipole matrix elements (Eq. (1)). This shows

the necessity to calculate transition matrix elements appropriately. We present the elec-
tric dipole transition amplitudes in both length and velocity gauges in Table II. The good
agreement between these two forms from the calculations using the same initial and ﬁnal
wavefunctions highlights the fact that the numerical algorithm is robust. A detailed deriva-
tion and interpretation of diﬀerent gauges can be found in (Bethe and Salpeter 1957), and
in few recent references (W. R. Johnson et al. 2002). The little diﬀerences in the values of
these two forms for particular transition amplitude may be improved by considering nega-
tive energy states in the calculation. In few transition amplitudes, there are considerable
disagreement between the length- and velocity-forms. The detail analysis might be possible
using the approach suggested by (Savukov and Johnson 2000). In table III, we have given
the ab initio oscillator strengths (f-value) for ‘ground to excited’ and ‘excited to excited’
transitions, which are also astrophysically important. Here we are presenting the oscillator
strength in the length gauge due to its comparative fast convergence (Das & Idress 1990).

3. Conclusion

Highly correlated relativistic coupled cluster theory has been employed to study the os-
cillator strengths of the astrophysically important electric dipole transitions. To our knowl-
edge these are the ﬁrst calculations of oscillator strengths for most of the transitions pre-
sented here. All the transitions are in the ultraviolet, visible or near infrared regions. The
good agreement between transition amplitudes obtained from length and velocity gauge ex-
pressions highlight the accuracies of our computational method. This work will motivate
astronomers to observe these lines of V4+ to predict the abundances of these species in
astronomical bodies and experimentalists to verify our results.

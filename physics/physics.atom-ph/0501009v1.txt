We demonstrate a combination of an isotopically puriﬁed atom beam and a magneto-optical trap
which enables the single atom detection of all stable isotopes of calcium (40, 42, 43, 44, 46 and 48).
These isotopes range in abundance from 96.9 % (40Ca) to 0.004 % (46Ca). The trap is loaded from
an atomic beam which is decelerated in a Zeeman slower and subsequently deﬂected over an angle
◦
of 30
by optical molasses. The isotope selectivity of the Zeeman slower and the deﬂection stage is
investigated experimentally and compared with Monte Carlo simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Trace analysis of long-lived isotopes has become an
important tool in modern science. From medical sci-
ence to environmental research, from nuclear safety to
archeology, the capability to detect low-abundance long-
lived isotopes has opened many research ﬁelds [1]. For
the detection of trace elements Atom Trap Trace Anal-
ysis (ATTA) is a promising and potentially very pow-

million year old groundwater from the Nubian Aquifer
(Egypt) has been dated using ATTA, by detecting very
small traces of 81Kr [4]. Because there are no interfer-
ences from other elements ATTA has the potential to also
detect the long-lived isotope 41Ca at its natural abun-
dance level of 10−14 [5]. This would open the possibility
to perform radio-calcium dating with 41Ca, which has a
half-life of 105 years [5, 6]. Furthermore, 41Ca could be
used as a tracer to directly monitor the bone loss and
retention rates of human subjects in both research and
diagnosis of osteoporosis [7]. As an alternative to Accel-
erator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), ATTA may provide
a small-scale and cost-eﬀective detection method of rare
isotopes, such as the example of 81Kr showed. Recently
ATTA has been compared with the established technique
of Low Level Counting (LLC)[8]. A competing compact
laser-based method is Resonance Ionization Mass Spec-
trometry (RIMS), which has been successfully developed
in recent years [9, 10, 11]. RIMS combines the selec-
tivity of laser spectrometry with the technique of mass
separation. Recently it has been shown that ATTA is
already suﬃciently sensitive to detect 41Ca in enriched
(10−8) calcium samples for biomedical applications [12].
We have set up an ATTA experiment with the ultimate
goal of detecting 41Ca at the natural abundance level.

ATTA experiments combine various optical tech-
niques, each of which is isotope selective. The mechanism
of isotope selection is the repeated excitation (by a laser)
of an optically accessible electronic transition in the neu-
tral atom. Because of the isotope shift the scattering
force induced by light of a ﬁxed frequency is diﬀerent for
the diﬀerent isotopes. It is the ratio between the natural
linewidth and the isotope shift of the pumping transition
that determines the selectivity that can be reached be-

tween neighboring isotopes. For the calcium isotopes the
isotope shift is about ﬁve times the natural linewidth;
therefore isotope selectivity in laser pumping of calcium
isotopes is possible. Reducing the Doppler broadening
of the transition is an essential ingredient for the isotope
selectivity. Therefore, cold atoms are an ideal and nec-
essary tool for ultra-sensitive isotope detection. Samples
of cold atoms can be obtained by laser cooling and trap-
ping in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) [13], which is the
central element of an ATTA experiment.

The ﬁnal sensitivity that can be reached in an ATTA
experiment is limited either by the background of 40Ca
atoms or by the loading rate of the trap. The background
of 40Ca atoms can be reduced by improving the isotope
selectivity, the loading rate can be increased by improv-
ing the eﬃciency. In the ATTA measurements reported
on in [12] the isotope selectivity was the limiting factor
for the sensitivity. In this article the isotope selectivity
has been investigated in detail. This results in a setup in
which the search for 41Ca atoms is no longer limited by
the isotope selectivity but by the loading eﬃciency. The
loading eﬃciency is limited at the moment by the laser
power available for the experiment.

In section II of this article the various parts of our ex-
perimental setup will be presented. In section III three
diﬀerent loading schemes for the MOT are compared with
the purpose of improving the isotope selectivity. Monte
Carlo simulations were made to help understand the iso-
tope selectivity of the Zeeman slower and the deﬂection
stage. Finally, experimental data of the detection of sin-
gle calcium atoms in the MOT are presented.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our experimental method is schematically depicted in
ﬁgure 1. The metallic calcium sample is placed in oven
1 from which atoms are evaporated to create an atomic
beam. The divergence of the atomic beam of a selected
isotope can be reduced using optical compression with
laser beams perpendicular to the atomic beam [14]. The
other isotopes are not aﬀected or even pushed out of
the atomic beam. The second step in the selection of
the isotopes, and essential for the eﬃcient loading of
the magneto-optical trap, is a Zeeman slower. It slows

the atoms down by the absorption of photons from a
counter-propagating laser beam [15]. The Doppler shift
resulting from the longitudinal velocity of the atoms is
continuously compensated by a Zeeman shift, induced
by the magnetic ﬁeld along the axis. The resulting slow
atom beam leaving from the oven is deﬂected over 30◦
in the direction of the Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) by
a standing wave ﬁeld tilted at the proper angle. This
deﬂection stage is an essential step in the isotope selec-
tivity and the total sensitivity that can be reached. As
will be shown in this paper only the selected isotope is
eﬀectively deﬂected and guided into the trap. This im-
proves the signal-to-noise ratio in the detection of the rare
isotopes, and thereby enables the use of a higher atom
ﬂux. The detection of the rare isotopes takes place in
the MOT. Only atoms of one isotope can be trapped for
a given laser frequency. By scanning the laser frequency
and observing the ﬂuorescence of the trapped atoms we
detected all stable isotopes of calcium down to the single
atom level. The trap can also be loaded from a second
oven; it is connected to the deﬂection chamber with a
valve as indicated in ﬁgure 1. This second atom beam
enables us to make a direct comparison between the dif-
ferent methods by which the trap can be loaded. This
will be presented in section III. The various parts of the
experiment will be presented here in some more detail.

At 423 nm, calcium has a strong resonance transition
from the ground 4s2 1S0 state to the 4s4p 1P1 state which
is rather well suited for laser cooling. The required 423
nm laser light for the cooling is generated by frequency
doubling of the output of an 846 nm diode laser (Toptica
Photonics AG). By ampliﬁcation in a tapered ampliﬁer
up to 500 mW of 846 nm light is produced; after the fre-
quency doubling with an LBO crystal we typically have
55 mW of 423 nm light available for the locking of the
laser (5 mW), the compression stage (10 mW), the Zee-
man slower (20 mW), the deﬂection stage (5 mW) and
the MOT (15 mW). The amount of laser power available
is the limiting factor for the eﬃciency of the experiment,
and could be increased by investing in a more intense
source of light at 846 nm. The main laser beam is split
and frequency shifted using beam-splitters and acousto-

2

optical modulators (AOM). The laser frequency is locked
to the cooling transition of calcium by means of polariza-
tion spectroscopy [16], which is done on an atomic beam
from oven 2. The average trapping time of calcium in a
MOT is limited to ∼ 20 ms due to a weak leak (10−5)
from the 4s4p 1P1 to the 1D2 state. From the 1D2 state
roughly 75 % decays to the ground state within 3 ms, and
can be recaptured if the diameters of the trapping laser
beams are large enough. The rest of the atoms are lost
from the trap, and limit the trapping time. The trapping
time can be increased by repumping the atoms from the
1D2 to the 5s 1P1 state, from which they quickly decay
back to the ground state [17]. The laser light required
for the repumping is generated by a home built diode
laser operating at 672 nm, of which typically 5 mW is
available for the MOT. Only for the measurements with
single atoms presented here the repump laser has been
used.

The calcium atoms are placed in an oven from which
the atoms are evaporated. The ovens have 10 exit chan-
nels each with a diameter of 1 mm and a length of 10
mm. A ceramic tube around the oven holds tantalum
wires which are used to heat the oven to temperatures
in the range of 400 to 600 ◦C. The Maxwellian velocity
distribution for calcium atoms with a temperature of 600
◦C peaks at a velocity of 600 m/s.

The transverse velocity is less than one tenth of the
longitudinal velocity, provided the mean free path of the
atoms is larger than the length of the exit channel of
the oven. Directly after the atoms leave the oven we
have the possibility to apply transverse compression of
the atom beam. The Doppler shift ωD of the moving
atom, the isotope shift Is and the natural linewidth Γ of
the transition together determine the eﬀective scattering
rate of a speciﬁc isotope. For a speciﬁc laser detuning δ
and power s0 the scattering rate γp [18] is given by

γp =

s0Γ/2
1 + s0 + (2(δ + ωD + Is)/Γ)2

(1)

As can be seen from table I the typical isotope shift be-
tween two adjacent isotopes of calcium is about 160 - 200
MHz. The natural linewidth of the cooling transition is
34 MHz, and the Doppler shift for the calcium atoms is
2.1 MHz/(m/s).

Because the transverse Doppler broadening is limited
the compression is isotope selective: when tuning the
laser frequency in between two adjacent isotopes there
will be a force on both isotopes, opposite in sign. The
result is that the lighter isotope of the two will be
pushed away from the beam axis while at the same time
the transverse velocity component of the heavier isotope
can be reduced, resulting in an improved transmission
through the Zeeman slower. We have done Monte Carlo
simulations to investigate this eﬀect in more detail: a
detailed comparison with experimental results will be re-
ported on in the near future.

The Zeeman slower is designed to decelerate atoms
with initial velocities up to 1000 m/s (corresponding to

85% of the atoms) down to 50 m/s. The total length is
0.86 meter. The magnetic ﬁeld has a maximum of 0.16
Tesla at the entrance of the Zeeman slower, and decreases
towards the exit. The laser beam counter-propagating
the atoms has a σ+ polarization and a typical power of
20 mW. To avoid an extra velocity spread of the atoms,
the slowing process has to be terminated quickly, cf. ref-
erence [20]. Therefore, the magnetic ﬁeld has a negative
oﬀset (as a result the slowing laser is detuned by -320
MHz) and is terminated with a strong positive magnetic
ﬁeld. The laser beam is focused on the exit channels of
the oven. As a result there is a gradient of the laser in-
tensity along the Zeeman slower, for which the shape of
the magnetic ﬁeld slope has been adjusted. The coil gen-
erating the magnetic ﬁeld is divided in 8 independently
adjustable sections so that the ﬁeld can be optimized.

In the deﬂection chamber the desired isotope is de-
ﬂected out of the slowed atom beam by a combination of
two counter-propagating red-detuned laser beams which
cross the atom beam under an angle of 30◦. At this point
the Doppler broadening is suﬃciently reduced so that di-
rect isotope selection is possible, even when probing the
beam under 30 degrees. At this point the laser beam
has a diameter of only 0.5 cm, the same detuning as the
trapping beams, and has a typical power of 5 mW. Only
the selected isotope will be deﬂected so that it can reach
the trap, which is located 40 cm further downstream.

The atoms are trapped by a standard Magneto-Optical
Trap. Typically 15 mW of laser power is split over 3 laser
beams which are retro-reﬂected to make the 6 required
trapping beams. The magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld is gener-
ated by two coils in anti-Helmholtz conﬁguration placed
outside the vacuum (902 windings each, typical current
3 A) resulting in a magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 8 mT/cm.
The ﬂuorescence of the atoms in the trap is measured by a
photo-multiplier tube (PMT) in photon-counting mode.
A lens system of 2.54 cm diameter is placed inside the
chamber at a focal distance of 3 cm from the trapped
atoms to eﬃciently collect the ﬂuorescence. This lens
system is adapted from reference [21]. Outside the vac-
uum trapping chamber the light from the trap is focused
through a pinhole before detection by the PMT to reduce

detection system also a CCD camera and a photo-diode
are used. The windows of the MOT have been mounted
on extension tubes and are anti-reﬂection coated. In or-
der to further reduce the amount of scattered light the
inside of the vacuum chamber is coated black. The typi-
cal pressure in the MOT is 10−9 mbar which can rise to
10−8 mbar depending on the oven temperature.

able to count the number of atoms arriving and leaving
the trap over a certain period of time, and determine the
abundance from a comparison with the known abundance
of another isotope. Experimental results on the detection
of the single atoms are presented and discussed in section
III C.

The present sensitivity of 41Ca detection by ATTA, as
reported by Moore et al [12], is limited by the background
of 40Ca atoms present in the trap, and by the trapping
time of the atoms. Even though the 40Ca atoms are
not trapped while detecting 41Ca, they contribute to the
ﬂuorescence signal from the trap, obscuring the signal
from the less abundant isotopes. It is therefore a key issue
to further increase the isotope selectivity. Besides the
ﬂuorescence background from these 40Ca atoms, there
is the ﬂuorescence background due to scattering of the
trapping laser beams from the windows and walls of the
trapping chamber. For any measurement of single atoms
in a MOT this source of background has to be made as
small as possible.

We have compared the isotope selectivity of three dif-
ferent trap loading schemes. As an indication of the iso-
tope selectivity of our system the amount of ﬂuorescence
due to the hot 40Ca atoms is measured while trapping
the calcium isotope 43Ca. The experimental results are
presented in the next section.

III. RESULTS

The starting point of the experiment is the atomic
beam as it leaves the oven. The natural abundance of
the various isotopes in this beam can be seen in ﬁgure 2.
In this ﬁgure the ﬂuorescence of the atomic beam com-
ing from oven 2 is shown, excited only by the vertical
trapping laser beam in the MOT. The ﬂuorescence is
measured by a PMT under right angles with both the
atom beam and the laser beam. The peaks have been
ﬁtted with Lorentzian proﬁles, all having the same width
(38 MHz) and an amplitude corresponding to the nat-
ural abundance as given in table I. The ﬁt curve is in
good agreement with the measured spectrum. The mea-
sured width of 38 MHz is slightly larger than the natural
linewidth of 34 MHz: this corresponds to a transverse
velocity component of 1.9 m/s in the atomic beam. This
ﬁgure gives an indication of the limited maximum selec-

tivity that can be reached in a single excitation step: the
power of ATTA lies in the fact that the same transition
is excited very often.

A. Comparing diﬀerent loading schemes

In this section three diﬀerent loading schemes are com-
pared with respect to isotope selectivity. The simplest
conﬁguration is to load the MOT directly from a thermal
beam. Since the capture velocity of the trap is ∼ 50 m/s
only the low velocity tail of the Boltzmann distribution is
trapped. When the MOT is operated on one of the heav-
ier isotopes, the large amount of 40Ca limits the detection
of these less abundant isotopes in the trap. The horizon-
tal trapping beams which intersect the atom beam at 45◦

can excite the fast 40Ca atoms in the atom beam as the
frequency of the trapping laser beams is scanned over
the various isotopes. The broad velocity distribution of
these hot 40Ca atoms can be seen in ﬁgure 3 as it dom-
inates the ﬂuorescence at frequencies where for example
trapped 46Ca atoms should be visible. To enable com-
parison with ﬁgures 4 and 5, the ﬂuorescence is set to 1
at the resonance frequency of 46Ca (1160 MHz). The hot
atoms not only scatter the laser-light, thereby obscur-
ing the signal from the trapped atoms, but also shorten
the trapping time of other isotopes by collisions with the
trapped atoms. The ratio between the ﬂuorescence of the
trapped 43Ca and the background 40Ca is ∼ 0.15.

When the trap is loaded from a slowed atom beam
the amount of trapped atoms increases because a larger
fraction of the atoms falls within the capture range of
the trap. Figure 4 shows the ﬂuorescence detected in
the MOT, while simultaneously scanning the frequency
of the trapping laser and the Zeeman slower laser beams
over the range of isotopes. This measurement was done
before the deﬂection stage was installed. It can be seen
that the relative contribution of the hot 40Ca atoms is
greatly reduced. Comparing ﬁgure 3 to ﬁgure 4, the ratio
of for example the trapped 44Ca to the 40Ca-background
increases from 2.5 to 5000. The reduction of the 40Ca-
background enables the detection of trapped 46Ca atoms
with a natural abundance of only 0.004 %, which was not
possible when loading the trap directly from the thermal
beam. The ﬁgure is normalized to the intensity of the
46Ca peak. The ratio between the trapped 46Ca and the
background 40Ca is ∼ 3, for 43Ca the ratio to the 40Ca
background is ∼ 15. The increase of isotope selectivity
is the result of both the increased fraction of slow atoms
and the isotope selectivity of the Zeeman slower itself. In
section III B we will look at this in some more detail.

We ﬁnd that the background signal from fast 40Ca
atoms disappears almost completely when loading the

trap from a deﬂected, slow beam. In the measurement
presented in ﬁgure 5 the background in between all the
trapped isotopes is found to be mostly dependent on the
intensity of the laser trapping beams, and only slightly
on the oven temperature (atom ﬂux). This is further il-
lustrated by ﬁgure 6. Here the ﬂuorescence from the trap
is shown while scanning over the 43Ca trapping frequency
for two diﬀerent oven temperatures. While the 43Ca
peak intensity increases by a factor of 6.6 (from ∼ 500
to ∼ 3300 counts/10 ms), the average background level
changes only from 475.9 ± 0.7 to 492.5 ± 0.5 counts/10
ms. This insigniﬁcant background increase of less then
4 %, corresponding to 16.6 ± 0.6, is due to extra 40Ca
atoms. The purely 40Ca dependent background compo-
nent should also have increased by a factor of 6.6: there-
fore we can conclude that at 450 ◦C the background con-
tribution due to 40Ca is 2.5 ± 0.1 counts/10 ms. The
43Ca signal relative to the 40Ca background is therefore
∼ 200. When comparing this to a directly trapped ther-
mal beam (ﬁgure 3) the ratio of the 43Ca signal to the
40Ca background is increased by a factor of ∼ 1300. The
rest of the background is due to laser light scattered from
the walls and the windows of the trapping chamber, and
can be further reduced to 125 counts / 10 ms as shown
by the data on single atoms, presented in section III C.
It is noted that the measured 43Ca to 46Ca ratio changes,
when comparing ﬁgure 4 to ﬁgure 5. This is discussed in
section III D.

B. Monte Carlo simulations

The isotope selectivity of the Zeeman slower can be
understood on basis of the results of Monte Carlo sim-
ulations. In the simulation results depicted in ﬁgure 7,
the ﬁnal velocity distributions for 40Ca, 41Ca and 42Ca
atoms were calculated for our Zeeman slower with the

background level remains almost constant.

laser frequency optimized for 41Ca. Most of the 41Ca
atoms are decelerated to the desired velocity of about 50
m/s; for both the other isotopes this is diﬀerent. This
for a given laser detun-
can be understood as follows:
ing all the isotopes of calcium will be resonant in the
Zeeman slower, but at diﬀerent locations because of the
isotope shifts. These isotope shifts translate into dif-
ferent scattering rates in the Zeeman slower, according
to equation 1. Therefore the ﬁnal velocity of the diﬀer-
ent isotopes leaving the Zeeman slower will be diﬀerent.
The magnetic ﬁeld slope of the Zeeman slower is steeper
at the end, where the average velocity of the atoms is

lower. If the laser is tuned to 41Ca atoms, then the 42Ca
atoms will initially also be decelerated, but the slope of
the magnetic ﬁeld is too steep: the change in velocity is
not enough to keep up with the change in magnetic ﬁeld.
Therefore this isotope will be lost from the slowing pro-
cess. On the other hand, a 40Ca atom is nicely slowed
down until the end, but the slowing process continues too
long. In the simulation the far majority of these atoms
undergo a reversal of their longitudinal velocity. They
will thus be lost even due to their small transversal ve-
locity component and do not reach the MOT.

As can be seen from ﬁgure 4 a signiﬁcantly lower back-
ground from 40Ca is detected in the MOT for a trapping
detuning smaller than about 450 MHz. With this detun-
ing we probe 40Ca atoms with a velocity range below 200
m/s. Since there is at the moment no collimation of the
atom beam at the exit of the Zeeman slower these atoms
probably do not reach the trap due to the divergence of
the atomic beam. The Zeeman slower is designed to slow
the desired isotope to 50 m/s; from the fact that we trap
these isotopes we conclude that for these isotopes the
gain due to the larger number of slow atoms outweighs
the loss due to the transverse velocity spread. However,
many more of these slow atoms could reach the trap if
we implement a second transversal cooling stage at the
exit of the Zeeman slower.

To assess the functionality of the large-angle deﬂection
by optical molasses we have performed Monte-Carlo sim-
40Ca, 41Ca and 42Ca atoms with a range of
ulations.
longitudinal velocities have been traced through the de-
ﬂection molasses. Absorption and emission probabilities
are calculated along the way, and every time a photon is
absorbed and emitted the velocity of the atom is adjusted
correspondingly. Stimulated emission is also accounted

for. Plotted in ﬁgure 8 are the deﬂection angles as a
function of the initial velocity for 40Ca, 41Ca, and 42Ca

and the deﬂection laser beams is shown. As in the ex-
periment, the laser power is 5 mW distributed uniformly
over a beam diameter of 0.5 cm. The deﬂection laser is
tuned 40 MHz below the resonance frequency of 41Ca.
While the 41Ca atoms are deﬂected well for velocities up
to 90 m/s, the 40Ca are pushed away from the atomic
beam axis. This is the main reason that the combination
of a Zeeman slower and the large-angle deﬂection is so
eﬀective in selectively deﬂecting only one desired isotope
out of the atom beam. Due to the large additional de-
tuning caused by the isotope shift, 42Ca is not aﬀected
at all. Similar simulations have been done for diﬀerent
laser power, and it follows that both the isotope selectiv-
ity and the eﬃciency of the deﬂection stage increase with
increasing laser power.

For 40Ca we can analyze the deﬂection behavior in
some more detail. Only the velocity component along the
axis of the molasses laser beams (called vmol) is aﬀected
by the deﬂection molasses. The 40Ca atoms are much
closer to resonance to the molasses laser beam pushing
them away from the trap (laser 2, cf. ﬁg 8). The num-
ber of scattered photons depends on the scattering rate
as given in formula 1, and on the time the atoms spend
in the optical molasses. For the 40Ca atoms at the given
detuning this scattering rate is a Lorentzian with its max-
imum at vmol = 50 m/s. This corresponds to an atom
with a longitudinal velocity (called vlong) of 100 m/s.
During the time that the atoms are in the optical mo-
lasses vmol will change due to the scattering. The atoms
can be accelerated to a ﬁnal vmol which depends on the
time spent in the molasses and the linewidth of the tran-
sition. The deﬂection angle is determined by the ratio
between vmol and vlong. The minimum in the deﬂec-
tion angle for 40Ca atoms around 20 m/s is the region
where vmol is limited by the time the atom spent in the
molasses. For vlong < 5 m/s the deﬂection reaches the
maximum possible deﬂection angle of 60◦, i.e. parallel
to the molasses laser beams. For vlong > 30 m/s vmol
reaches a maximum value limited by the linewidth of the
transition. The deﬂection angle is then just determined
by the ratio of this maximum value of vmol and the initial
longitudinal velocity.

C. Single atoms

Single atoms can be detected in a magneto-optical
trap because the trapped atoms are continuously scat-
tering photons from the trapping laser beams. Provided
the amount of detected photons not originating from the
trapped atom is low enough, a single trapped atom can

the atomic beam becomes less and less intense, down
to a loading rate of only a few atoms per minute. At
some point the ﬂuorescence from the trap displays dis-
crete steps: we can count the number of atoms in the
trap. Shown in ﬁgure 9 is the ﬂuorescence of single 40Ca
atoms detected in the trap for a period of 10 seconds.
We have also detected single atoms from all other sta-
ble calcium isotopes. During the time that an atom is
trapped it can scatter photons at an estimated rate (de-
pending on laser detuning and intensity) of 1.3 · 106 s−1.
We detect 35 ± 3 photons per 4 ms per atom, which re-
sults in a total photon detection eﬃciency of 0.7 %. The
background level is 50 photons per 4 ms. This should
not be confused with the noise level, which is limited by
statistics. Trapping the atoms longer enables us to use a
larger integration time which reduces the statistical er-
ror on the signal. During the measurement of ﬁgure 9
the repump laser was used: we concluded from trap de-
cay time measurements that the average trapping time
improved from ∼ 20 ms to ∼ 200 ms. It is important to
note that the background contribution due to hot 40Ca
atoms such as reported in section III A, even at high oven
temperatures, is much lower then the ﬂuorescence signal
of a single trapped atom.

D.

Isotope fractionation

The ﬁnal issue we will address in this article is that
of isotope fractionation eﬀects in the experiment. The
maximum ﬂuorescence of the various trapped isotopes in
ﬁgure 5 is compared to literature values [22] in table II.
The absolute amount of 40Ca could not be measured ac-
curately in the same experiment due to the high intensity
of the ﬂuorescence: therefore the relative abundance of
the heavier isotopes was compared to 44Ca. The abun-
dance of 44Ca was set to the literature value of 2.09.

For all isotopes except 43Ca the agreement is reason-

0.006% for the typically used laser power of ∼ 40 mW.
This corresponds to only ∼ 4 % of the literature value.
This large discrepancy is due to diﬀerences in the cool-
ing and trapping eﬃciency of the odd isotopes of cal-
cium: the odd isotopes 41Ca and 43Ca have a nuclear
spin of I=7/2. The resulting magnetic substructure of the
ground and the excited state inﬂuences the Doppler cool-
ing force. Comparable observations have been reported
for the case if the odd strontium isotopes [23]. We have
adapted the theoretical model developed for strontium
and have solved the generalized optical Bloch equations
for the odd calcium isotopes taking into account all the
hyperﬁne states and their magnetic sub-states. We ﬁnd
that the maximum deceleration force on the odd isotopes
for a one-dimensional σ+-σ− optical molasses conﬁgura-
tion is only half as strong as that on the even isotopes.
This indicates that the number of photons emitted per
trapped atom in a certain period of time is only half that
of the even isotopes. This alone cannot explain the re-
duction of a factor of 25 in the detection of 43Ca. Since
the cooling force is weaker this eﬀect could also limit the
eﬃciency of the deﬂection and slowing of the odd iso-
topes. In order to investigate this issue, we have done a
recent experiment where we ﬁnd that the measured 43Ca
abundance depends signiﬁcantly on the laser-power. In-
creasing the total laser-power from 50 mW to 70 mW
the ratio between 43Ca and 46Ca increases from 1.2 to
15. This ratio can be more accurately measured than
the relative abundances, due to non-linear eﬀects in the
detection system for the very high count rates when mea-
suring 44Ca. A ratio of 15 corresponds to a measured
abundance for 43Ca of 0.06 %: this is roughly half of the
literature value. This observation indicates clearly that
the eﬃciency of the deﬂection and the Zeeman slower is
diﬀerent for the odd and even isotopes, and depends crit-
ically on the laser power available. Thus for the planned
investigations on 41Ca, the isotope 43Ca should be cho-
sen as reference, due to its expected similar behavior in
the experimental scheme.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated the trapping of all stable iso-
topes of calcium involving cooling in a Zeeman slower and
deﬂection of the cooled beam by 30◦ in a tilted optical
molasses. A corresponding experimental system has been
built with a sensitivity that enables us to detect even sin-
gle trapped atoms of all these isotopes. To suppress the
interfering 40Ca ﬂuorescence background when detecting
the less abundant isotopes the deﬂection of the slowed
loading beam over 30◦ was found to be very eﬀective.
The background due to 40Ca decreased by three orders
of magnitude compared to direct loading from a thermal
atomic beam. We ﬁnd that ﬁnally the background signal
for single atom detection of the less abundant isotopes is
no longer limited by the 40Ca atoms but dominated by
laser stray light. This enables single atom detection of all
stable isotopes. Improvements will be made to the setup:
increasing the laser power will increase the eﬃciency and
further improve the performance and the isotope selectiv-
ity of the individual components: transversal beam com-

pression, Zeeman slower and deﬂection stage. Adding
a second isotope selective compression stage directly af-
ter the Zeeman slower is another potential improvement.
With these changes the system will be ready to start
searching for 41Ca atoms at the natural abundance level.

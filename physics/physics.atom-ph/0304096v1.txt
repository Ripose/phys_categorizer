We investigate the experimental spectra of excited NO molecules in the diamagnetic regime and
develop a quantitative semiclassical framework to account for the results. We show the dynamics
can be interpreted in terms of classical orbits provided that in addition to the geometric orbits,
diﬀractive eﬀects are appropriately taken into account. We also show how individual orbits can
be extracted from the experimental signal and use this procedure to reveal the ﬁrst experimental
manifestation of inelastic diﬀractive orbits.

Periodic orbit (PO) theory [1] has been a very success-
ful quantitative and qualitative tool in the analysis of
systems displaying strong quantum ﬂuctuations. In par-
ticular, the complex photoabsorption spectrum of excited
hydrogen atoms in a static magnetic ﬁeld was interpreted
within closed orbit theory (COT) in terms of periodic or-
bits closed at the nucleus [2]. However standard PO the-
ory was shown to be insuﬃcient for systems containing a
scatterer smaller or comparable to one de Broglie wave-
length, because the PO’s may hit the scatterer, thereby
producing diﬀractive orbits [3].
In certain mesoscopic
devices diﬀractive orbits crucially inﬂuence the spectrum
[4], whereas in non-hydrogenic Rydberg atoms in static
ﬁelds the atomic core acts as a scatterer producing com-
bination orbits [5]. This was experimentally observed in
the photoabsorption spectrum of helium, which departs
slightly from the hydrogenic case [6]. In the case of Ryd-
berg molecules, core eﬀects are expected to be more im-
portant: the reason is that the diﬀractive scatterer has
an internal structure (the quantum states of the molec-
ular core). Indeed, model calculations recently predicted
that Rydberg molecules in external ﬁelds would display a
novel type of diﬀractive orbit produced by inelastic scat-
tering of the PO’s on the core [7].

In this work, we address this problem by investigating
the experimental spectrum of excited NO molecules in
a magnetic ﬁeld. We show the apparently complex spec-
trum can be well understood in terms of closed orbits pro-
vided molecular core eﬀects are appropriately taken into
account; in particular, we shall see COT calculations cor-
rectly reproduce the Fourier transform of the experimen-
tal spectrum, in a regime in which quantum calculations
have yet to be undertaken. We will also demonstrate how
individual orbits may be extracted from the experimental
results by using a modiﬁed Fourier tranform, and use this
technique to show the ﬁrst experimental manifestation of

an inelastic diﬀractive orbit in a physical system.

Most previous studies of atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld have
relied on scaled-energy spectroscopy, in which the ﬁeld
B is varied with the Rydberg electron energy E so as
to keep the scaled energy ǫ = E(B/B0)−2/3 constant,
with B0 = 2.35 × 105 T. Then the classical motion is
unchanged at each point of the spectrum and each orbit
contributes as a peak in the Fourier transformed (FT)
spectrum. However, such a scaling law does not hold, al-
beit approximately, for molecules. We have therefore ob-
served the Rydberg states of NO at a constant magnetic
ﬁeld of 0.93 T, varying the excitation energy of the probe
laser. The experiment, carried out in a ”magnetic bottle”
time of ﬂight spectrometer, was described elsewhere [8],
but in short: a 2-photon highly selective transition with
a pump laser brings the molecule from the ground state
X 2Π3/2 (in the vibrational level v” = 0) into the single

FIG. 2: (a) Fourier-transform of the experimental spectrum.
The ﬁrst peak (marked with a star) is a residual oscillation
from the background due to the redistribution of the oscilla-
tor strength into molecular Zeeman structures at low energies
[9]. (b) Closed-orbit semiclassical calculation. An indepen-
dent calculation was performed for each value of MN ; each
result was then multiplied by the relative weight of the MN
component before taking the Fourier transform. Note that
the wide peaks are not correlated with single closed orbits
but arise from a coherent superposition of orbits at diﬀerent
energies. The shortest contributing orbit is an orbit perpen-
dicular to the ﬁeld with a period of 4.22 ps.

rotational Zeeman sublevel N = 3 MS = 1/2 of the ﬁrst
electronic excited state A2Σ+, v′ = 1; N is the total an-
gular momentum exclusive of spin and the constant spin
number MS will henceforth be disregarded. The sub-
levels MN = −3 to 3 (where MN is the projection of
N on the ﬁeld axis) were not resolved but their relative
population is known. In a second step, the probe laser,
linearly polarized parallel to the ﬁeld axis, excites the
molecules to high-lying Rydberg states having also v = 1
(so we can neglect vibrational couplings).

These excited states are further ionized via vibrational
autoionization into the ground state of the NO+ core.
The resulting spectrum, which lies higher in energy than
those previously published in [8] (in which nonperturba-
tive diamagnetic eﬀects could be neglected), is shown in
Fig. 1. The FT of the experimental spectrum is shown
in Fig 2(a), whereas Fig. 2(b) displays the semiclassical
calculations which will be detailed below. Unlike a spec-
trum taken at constant ǫ, the peaks seen here are not
due to a single orbit but arise from a coherent superposi-
tion of orbits at diﬀerent energies. Before turning to the
extraction of individual orbits, we detail the mechanism
giving rise to the peaks in the FT spectrum.

Since in the A2Σ+ state the orbital momentum of the
Rydberg electron is a mixture of both l = 0 and l = 2,
the probe laser excites to ﬁnal states having l = 1, 3 and
N = 2, 3, 4. Photo-excitation takes place in the molec-
ular frame (in which the Rydberg electron is coupled to
the molecular core), but following excitation the electron
uncouples from the core and N is no longer conserved,

FIG. 3: Schematic diagram of the excitation dynamics of the
Rydberg states of NO in a magnetic ﬁeld. (1) A pump laser
excites the molecules from the ground state X 2Π3/2 to the
intermediate state A2Σ+, N = 3, via a 2-photon transition.
A high-resolution probe laser then excites the molecules from
the intermediate state to Rydberg levels with orbital momen-
tum l = 1 and l = 3. (2) Following this excitation the Ryd-
berg electron uncouples from the molecular core which is left
freely rotating with rotation quantum numbers N + = 1, 3
or 5. (3) As the Rydberg electron leaves the core region its
dynamics is described using classical trajectories; the molec-
ular energy is partitioned between the Rydberg electron and
the core: as the core rotation increases (pictured by a larger
core), the energy of the Rydberg electron decreases (sym-
bolized by smaller orbits). The core region is less than 5 a.u.
large, whereas even the shortest orbit associated with a highly
rotating core in state N + = 5 extends beyond 1500 a.u. (4)
Some trajectories return to the core, which following the ter-
minology of diﬀractive PO theory we call the geometric closed
orbits; they are the same orbits that exist in the diamagnetic
hydrogen atom (i.e.
in the absence of the core). (5) As the
Rydberg electron enters the core region, its dynamics recou-
ples with the core. The waves carried by the geometric CO’s
overlap with the initially-dipole excited waves, producing ﬂuc-
tuations in the oscillator strength. (6) The electron scatters
oﬀ the core, uncouples, and follows again classical trajecto-
ries; during the scattering process, the electron may have ex-
changed energy with the core. Eventually, some trajectories
return once more to the core; these diﬀractive orbits, com-
posed of 2 geometric CO’s connected by elastic or inelastic
core-scattering, produce further ﬂuctuations in the oscillator
strength.

scaled energy ǫ of the Rydberg electron as the probe laser is

to the near integrable regime. For N + = 3, the dynamics
of the Rydberg electron is mostly regular. For N + = 1, the
electron enters the chaotic regime: at ǫ = −0.4, about 50 %
of the classical phase space is chaotic [13]. We also give the
modulus of QG and QD for N +′

values give a rough idea of the PO-independent part of the
ﬂuctuations strength associated with the diﬀerent geometric
and diﬀractive contributions.

the linear Zeeman shift, we have three main dynamical
regimes for the Rydberg electron, each associated with
a diﬀerent rotational core state. Table I gives, for each

the experimental spectrum.

At each energy EN + , some of the trajectories are
turned back by the ﬁeld and return to the core; those

Ak and Sk are 3-dimensional quantities respectively
linked to the 2-dimensional classical amplitude Ak and
action Sk of the kth closed orbit [12] (Sk includes the
Maslov index µk(EN + )); those quantities depend on the
energy of the Rydberg electron, i.e. on the core state and
on the excitation energy. QG
N + is a quantity depending
on the dipole transition factor from the A2Σ+ to the ex-
cited states, and on the transformation elements from the
coupled to the uncoupled frame; some values are given in
Table I.

When the semiclassical wavefunction carried by the the
geometric closed orbits returns to the core, it diﬀracts on
the scatterer (Fig. 3). This diﬀraction process, produces
newly outgoing trajectories q, which eventually return to
the core; the resulting diﬀractive contribution to f (E) is

FIG. 4: Extraction of individual orbits from the experimen-

illustration, we show the results for 4 orbits which exist at

turn of the perpendicular orbit (R2 in the nomenclature given

e.g.
corresponding scaled energy of this orbit is ǫ = −1.49. Broken

Fig. 1. Thick curve: chirped FT of the experimental spec-
trum obtained by calculating the function ξ(t; E) appearing
in Eq. (4) for this orbit. The arrow indicates the calculated
classical period of R2, which agrees very well with the posi-
tion of the peak appearing in the CFT. (b) CFT extraction
of the orbit V1, parallel to the ﬁeld axis, associated with the
core in state N + = 3, at ǫ = −0.85. (c) Extraction of the R1

orbit associated with the core in state N + = 1; orbits asso-
ciated with N + = 1 are generically more diﬃcult to extract
from the experimental signal because the oscillator strength
tends to be dominated by orbits associated with N + = 5
and 3 (see Table I). However, at this energy, corresponding
to ǫ = −0.48, the classical amplitude AR1
is very strong (be-
cause ǫ is close to the bifurcation energy at which this orbit is
created [16]), thereby allowing the signal to pick up its con-
tribution. (d) By applying the CFT procedure to the action
(EN +=1), we can also extract

extracted in (b) and (c); the period of the diﬀractive orbit

tum defects; the value of the 6 independent quantum de-
fects for NO is given in [8]). The matching between the
semiclassical waves and the core wavefunction takes place
in the stationary phase approximation. The oscillator
strength contains both elastic (N + = N +′) and inelastic
(N + 6= N +′) diﬀractive terms. In the one core-scatter
approximation, the total contribution to the ﬂuctuations
in the oscillator strength is obtained by summing the
imaginary parts of Eqs. (2) and (3).

The experimental or semiclassically calculated FT
spectra |F(t; ξ)| are respectively obtained by Fourier
transforming the photoelectron signal or the oscillator
strength for which we shall use the same notation f (E),

where ξ(t, E) = Et, and we set the energy variable rela-
tive to the N + = 1 ionization threshold as E = EN +=1.
The semiclassical calculations were undertaken by apply-
ing Eqs. (2) and (3). Since at each point E0 of the spec-
trum the orbits and therefore their amplitude and action
change, we have determined the classical quantities Ak,
Sk, µk on an energy grid for the primitive closed orbits
and their repetitions, keeping track of bifurcations as the
energy increases. We then interpolated those functions
so as to obtain classical quantities varying with the en-
ergy. This procedure, which is tractable for short orbits
provided the scaled energy is not too high, yields a good
agreement with the experimental FT spectrum, as seen
on Fig. 2(b). The semiclassical calculations allow to sin-
gle out contributions from the ensemble of geometric or
diﬀractive orbits associated with given core states. Full
details will be given elsewhere [9].

Eq. (4) is also at the basis of the extraction of indi-
vidual orbits from the experimental spectrum provided
ξ(t, E) is appropriately modiﬁed so as to counterbalance
the varying values of the classical quantites. Indeed in
the neighborhood of some energy E0 a classical orbit k
contributes locally as a sinusoidal oscillation of period
Tk(E0). But as the energy is varied, the classical motion
changes, turning the sinusoidal oscillation into a chirped
modulation. It has been shown very recently [14] that a
chirped Fourier Transform (CFT) converts a chirp mod-
ulation into a sine oscillation, thus giving a sharp peak in
the FT spectrum. A CFT is deﬁned by setting ξ(t, E) =
t(E − E0) + b(E − E0)2 + c(E − E0)3 + i ln α(E − E0)
b and c are numerical coeﬃcients and
in Eq.
α is a function, which depend on the orbit to be ex-
tracted: to extract an orbit k at some energy E0, we
Taylor expand the action Sk(E). To ﬁrst order, we have
∂ES(E0) = Tk(E0), i.e. the period of the orbit. There-
fore by setting b = −∂2
ESk(E0)/6
in the CFT exponent ξ, we can expect to eﬀectively lin-

ESk(E0)/2 and c = −∂3

earize the signal around E0 so that the CFT yields a
peak at t = Tk(E0). The peak can be enhanced by us-
ing a function α to compensate for the signal amplitude
variation; we have used the inverse of our interpolated
functions Ak(E). As discussed in great details in [14],
spurious peaks inevitably appear in the CFT spectrum.
We proceed in the following manner: using purely clas-
sical calculations, we compute on the one hand the CFT
of the experimental signal with the relevant parameters
a, b, and α, and on the other hand we determine the
period Tk(E0); the consistency of the procedure is en-
sured by the appearance of a peak at the computed value
t = Tk(E0) when the orbit is succesfully extracted from
the signal. An illustration of the extraction procedure is
given in Fig. 4. For a ﬁxed energy E0 we extract one CO
associated with each core state (panels (a)-(c)). Panel
(d) shows the extraction of the diﬀractive CO formed by
the combination of the orbits extracted in (b) and (c).

In summary, we have investigated the experimental
spectrum of NO in the diamagnetic regime and inter-
preted the results in terms of geometric and diﬀractive
classical orbits, and we have shown how individual orbits
can be extracted from the experimental signal.

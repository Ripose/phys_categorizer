The description of threshold fragmentation under long range repulsive forces is presented. The
dominant energy dependence near threshold is isolated by decomposing the cross section into a
product of a back ground part and a barrier penetration probability resulting from the repulsive
Coulomb interaction. This tunneling probability contains the dominant energy variation and it
can be calculated analytically based on the same principles as Wannier’s description for threshold
ionization under attractive forces. Good agreement is found with the available experimental cross
sections on detachment by electron impact from D−, O− and B−.

Storage ring based experiments on threshold detach-
ment from the deuteron (D−) and the oxygen (O−) neg-
ative ions by electron impact [1,2,3], and recently also
from B− [4], have stimulated the theoretical interest in
the mechanism and the quantitative description of this
process [5,6,7,8,9].
It is a fundamental question how
threshold detachment proceeds since for very low energies
the impacting electron does not even reach the atom be-
cause it is repelled by the loosely bound electron. Early
theoretical work on this problem tried to describe the
process by asymptotic properties of the wavefunction for
the two electrons in the continuum after the collision [10],
following the spirit of Wigner’s treatment for two-body
break up [11]. However, the predicted cross section agrees
purely with the experimental results.

Some recent theoretical treatments, following another
idea of the early days [12], emphasize the importance of
tunneling contributions, either by treating the impacting
electron as a constant perturbing electric ﬁeld [2], or by
merging a quantum and a classical description [5]. As-
tonishingly good agreement with the experiment, even at
low energies near threshold, comes from a coupled chan-
nel calculation in the impact-parameter formalism where
a classical trajectory is used for the relative motion of
target and projectile electron and the electron to be de-
tached is described quantum mechanically [7]. These re-
sults, at least the shape of the cross section, depend little
on the polarization potential used, as Lin etal. emphasize
[7]. Results of similar accuracy have have been reported
using a lowest order distorted-wave scheme, however, in
contrast to [7], with a sensitive dependence on the polar-
ization potential [8].

Without a full calculation of all electrons, one cannot
avoid to use parameters in one or another way, either
directly in the simpler models [1,2], or indirectly in the
more involved calculations modeling polarization poten-
tials for the loosely bound electron [5,6,7,8,9].

The theoretical work so far remains inconclusive con-
cerning a dominant mechanism of threshold detachment,
and the reason for the seemingly contradicting ﬁndings
concerning the robustness of the results with respect to
changes in the polarization potential is unknown.

A successful description of near threshold detachment
focusing on threshold properties should naturally depend
very little on details of the polarization since the long
range repulsion between target and projectile electron
dominates. Moreover, such an approach should uncover
a mechanism for threshold detachment and thereby clar-
ify the issue of robustness with respect to diﬀerent polar-
ization potentials.

In the following we will show that threshold detach-
ment by electrons can be described with the same tech-
nique which has lead to the successful (and purely classi-
cal) description of threshold ionization under long range
attractive Coulomb forces, pioneered by Wannier [13].

However, in order to learn how to deal with repul-
sive Coulomb forces, one must go back to a semiclassical
formulation of threshold ionization and analyze the rea-
son why Wannier’s classical treatment was appropriate.
Semiclassically, one may write the scattering amplitude
in the form [14]

where φj(E

consequence of the homogeneous Coulomb interaction. It

where σB(E) is a smooth back ground cross section with
σB(E
0) =const. Wannier showed that the domi-
nant energy dependence P (E) = P∗ is contained in a
single ﬁxed point orbit j =
[13]. Formally, this or-
bit represents an outgoing trajectory with ﬁxed angle
θ∗ = π between the two electrons and symmetric dis-
tances r1 = r2 of electron 1 and 2 from the core.
It
is convenient to use hyperspherical coordinates with an
overall radius r2 = r2
2 of the system and the hyper-
angle deﬁned by tan α = r1/r2. The symmetric escape
orbit corresponds to increasing hyperradius r and ﬁxed
α∗ = π/4. The potential energy of the two electrons in-
teracting with a core of charge Z can be written in the
form of a Coulomb potential with an angular dependent
charge, V = C(α, θ)/r. For Z > 1/4 the potential at the
ﬁxed point is with C∗ = C(α∗, θ∗) < 0 attractive. Hence
the relevant threshold orbit is classically allowed with a
real action Φ∗ and, as sketched above, the semiclassical
scattering amplitude leads for E
0 to the classical
cross section with dominant energy variation of the form

→

PCL(E) = (E/E0)β

(5)

as derived by Wannier [13].

On the other hand, for a ﬁxed point charge C∗ > 0
the Coulomb interaction is repulsive. Then, the relevant
threshold orbit is classically forbidden and represents a
tunneling trajectory with imaginary action Φ∗ = iΓ∗. In
this case the semiclassical cross section does not reduce
0. Rather, its major
to the classical one in the limit E
energy dependence results from a tunneling mechanism
which produces a Gamow factor

→

P (E) = exp[

2Γ∗(E)/¯h].

Clearly, the threshold cross section is through Eq. (6) ¯h-
dependent. Nevertheless, the important dynamical quan-
tities, namely the tunneling action Γ∗, is still given clas-
sically.

threshold fragmentation of charged particles the initial
conﬁguration is unimportant – the energy dependence of

the cross section is completely determined by the stability
of the ﬁnal fragment conﬁguration. This stability enters
P∗ of the escape orbit. That only the ﬁxed point orbit is
relevant close to threshold is justiﬁed by the fact that all
available energy (which approaches zero for E
0 and
r
) must be put into the radial degree of freedom
r in order to fragment the system. Hence, the system
evolves asymptotically in a frozen conﬁguration where
neither its geometrical shape (θ = θ∗), nor the relative
interparticle distances r1/r2 = tan α∗ change. Moreover,
due to the Coulomb scaling properties, any partial wave
with angular momentum L reduces in scaled coordinates
to an S-wave since the scaled angular momentum reads
˜L = L√E [14]. Therefore, only the S-wave has to be con-
sidered which remains also valid in the case of a repulsive
Coulomb force. Finally, for two escaping electrons, the
ﬁxed point conﬁguration θ∗ = π and α∗ = π/4 remains
the same for all charges of the core including the limit
Z = 0 which applies to the neutral atom for our prob-
lem of electron detachment. Hence, the radial motion on
the ﬁxed point manifold is governed by the Hamiltonian

by dividing the cross section by σB(E) from Eq. (11). The
coding of the data is as in Fig. 3. Theoretical P (E) from Eq.
(6).

The integration limits are the outer turning point rt
where the orbit becomes classically allowed, p(rt) = 0,
and a starting point ri, see Fig. 1. In contrast to thresh-
old fragmentation under attractive Coulomb forces tun-
neling threshold fragmentation depends on the initial
conﬁguration, at least as far as the value of ri in Eq. (8)
is concerned which will inﬂuence shape and magnitude of
P (E) in Eq. (6).

In a very crude approximation one could put ri = 0 ar-
guing that the the electronic momentum transfer requires
the recoil to be absorbed by the nucleus and its position
is where the outgoing electrons should start. However,
in the light of the (small) tunneling probability which
determines threshold detachment according to Eq. (6)
close to E = 0 this is certainly too crude. For small ex-
cess energy the projectile electron impacts roughly with
the binding energy I which is of the order of 1 eV. Re-
pelled by the loosely bound electron the projectile will
0 at this low impact energy. More real-
never reach ri ≈
istically, one can approximate ri by the classical turning
point of the incoming electron, projected onto the ﬁxed
point manifold whose dynamics is speciﬁed by Eq. (7).
Hence, to determine this turning point of the incoming
electron we put Pr = 0 in Eq. (7) at the incoming electron
energy of Ei = E + I to yield

ri = C∗/(E + I).

The initial momentum of the outgoing electron pair
p(ri) = √2I follows from the Hamiltonian Eq. (7) on the
ﬁnal energy surface Ef = E. The situation is sketched
in Fig. 1. Using Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) the threshold de-
tachment probability Eq. (6) reads in dimensionless units

where α = 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant, mec2 =
511keV is the rest mass of the electron, and C = C∗ is the
repelling charge of the two electrons on the ﬁxed point
manifold in units of e, see Eq. (7). One can cast Eq. (10)
into a more familiar form of atomic units by noting that
mec2/α2 = e2/a0 = 27.2116eV is just the atomic energy
unit. Clearly, the tunneling mechanism breaks the scal-
ing invariance of P (E) for diﬀerent systems characterized
by diﬀerent ionization potentials I since P (E) does not
only depend on E/I but also on m0c2/E. This is one
of the major diﬀerences compared to Wannier’s classical
result (Eq. (5)) for threshold ionization under attractive
Coulomb forces.

Diﬀerent P (E) are shown in Fig. 3 with solid lines cor-
responding to detachment from the ions B−, D−, and O−
respectively. The “experimental” tunneling probabilities
are extracted by ﬁtting the experimental cross sections
(Fig. 2) to Eq. (4) with

σB(E) = σ0/(b0 + E/I),

(11)

where σ0, b0 are ﬁtting parameters. The σB(E) obtained
in this way are shown in Fig. 4 for completeness and
exhibit the expected monotonically decreasing behavior.
As a ﬁnal support for the analytical P (E) from Eq.
(10) we have ﬁtted the experimental cross sections with
σ0, b0 and I as free parameters. The result for I was
0.297
0.04eV which is
close to the accurate values of 0.28, 0.75 and 1.46eV for
B−, D−, and O−, respectively.

while PCL(E) (Eq. (5)) under attractive Coulomb forces
is scale invariant. Yet, P (E) for threshold detachment
can be described semiclassically due to the dominant (re-
pulsive) Coulomb interaction which ensures through its
scaling properties that E
0 (see
→
Eq. (2)). The same scaling properties also reduce the
dominant energy dependence of all partial waves to that
of L = 0. Therefore, P (E) can be determined from the
S-wave only, as it has been done in the present work.

The present description diﬀers from various published
tunneling models approximating in one or another way
the actual electron motion by tunneling. In the present
treatment, only the dominant energy dependence of the
cross section is derived from a ﬁxed point orbit which
represents a tunneling trajectory. However, this trajec-
tory does not correspond to a true, physical two electron
orbit. Rather, it is a stationary point solution for ¯h
0,
in complete analogy to Wannier’s solution for the clas-
sically allowed case of attractive forces. This stationary
point calculated in the limit E
0 does not depend at all
on the polarization potential. Only the binding energy of
the target electron enters P (E) through ri as deﬁned in
Eq. (9) from the turning point of the incoming trajectory.
It is exactly this element which is similarly contained in
the calculation of Ref. [7]. Hence, this impact parameter
calculation captures an essential feature of the threshold
detachment dynamics making the whole calculation ro-
bust against details of the polarization potential. These
details will inﬂuence on the other hand the background
cross section σB(E) much more strongly. The distorted
wave calculation [8] by nature approximates the thresh-
old region from an expansion of the high energy limit
which is much more sensitive on details of the (shorter
range) polarization potential.

→

In summary, separating the rapidly changing detach-
ment probability P (E) from the background cross section
σB(E) we have shown that threshold fragmentation un-
der asymptotic repulsive Coulomb forces can be treated
on the same footing as the well established threshold ion-
ization under attractive Coulomb forces. In contrast to
the classical result for attractive forces, threshold detach-
ment of negative ions by electrons can be interpreted to
proceed via quantum mechanical tunneling of the out-
going electron pair. This implies a breaking of the scale
invariance of P (E) with respect to energy since P (E) de-
pends on mec2/E irrespectively of the target properties

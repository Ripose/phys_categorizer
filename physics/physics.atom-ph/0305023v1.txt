Abstract
We predict the presence and positions of purely-long-range bound states of 4He(2s 3S) +

4He(2p 3P ) near the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0,1 atomic limits. The results of the full multichannel and

approximate models are compared, and we assess the sensitivity of the bound states to atomic

parameters characterizing the potentials. Photoassociation to these purely-long-range molecular

bound states may improve the knowledge of the scattering length associated with the collisions

of two ultracold spin-polarized 4He(2s 3S) atoms, which is important for studies of Bose-Einstein

condensates.

INTRODUCTION

Photoassociation spectroscopy to purely-long-range molecular bound states has proven

a powerful tool for examining the ground state wavefunction of alkali atoms, and for pre-

cisely determining s-wave scattering lengths for these systems [1, 2, 3].

In recent years

there has been a growing interest in rare-gas atoms, and in particular helium systems. The
production of Bose-Einstein condensates of spin-polarized metastable 4He atoms by two dif-

ferent groups [4, 5] allows one to study the properties of these condensates and provides an
improved environment for further investigation of cold collisions of metastable 4He [6, 7].
Additional valuable information about the metastable 4He system may be obtainable from

photoassociation spectroscopy. Herschbach et al. [8] observed bound states that dissociate to
the 4He(2s 3S1)+ 4He(2p 3P2) atomic limit by detecting ions produced by Penning ionization.

Broadening of the photoassociation peaks due to Penning ionization did not hinder the ob-

servation of the vibrational series. There have been no published theoretical or experimental
studies of the 4He(2s 3S1) + 4He(2p 3P0,1) purely-long-range bound states.

In this paper we provide theoretical predictions for binding energies of levels of purely-
long-range molecular potentials that dissociate to the 4He(2s 3S1) + 4He(2p 3P0,1) atomic

limits. The purely-long-range bound states have inner turning points at internuclear separa-
tions larger than 150 a0 (1a0 = 5.29177 × 10−11m) and primarily depend on the dipole-dipole
C3 coeﬃcient and the ﬁne structure splittings of the 3P atom. These quantities are all deter-

mined from atomic properties. The purely-long-range bound states are independent of the

short-range form of the interaction potentials. Consequently, there may not be a detectable

ion signal from Penning ionization processes, which occur at small internuclear separations,

R < 20 a0. We cannot make theoretical predictions for levels that have a short-range contri-

bution, because the multipole expansion of the potentials is not appropriate for R < 30 a0
and no short-range 4He(2s 3S) + 4He(2p 3P ) potentials exist. For the remainder of the paper,
we implicitly mean 4He when referring to helium.

II. METHOD

We calculate the molecular eigenfunctions of a multichannel Hamiltonian containing the

relative kinetic energy operator, twelve non-relativistic Born-Oppenheimer potentials which

2

include retardation eﬀects, the atomic spin-orbit interaction of the 3P atom, and a term de-

scribing nuclear rotation. The model used is similar to that applied to the alkali systems [3].
The Movre-Pichler model [9] adapted to 3S + 3P systems yields the adiabatic potentials

obtained from diagonalizing, at each internuclear separation, the multichannel potentials

that include the dipole-dipole and spin-orbit interactions. In our calculations we have not

included Penning ionization or spontaneous emission, which can both be represented as an

optical or imaginary potential. The radial extent of the optical potential for Penning ion-

ization is localized well inside the inner turning point of the purely-long-range bound states

and therefore has a minor role to play for these states. Spontaneous emission is present at
all internuclear separations. However, near the 3S+3P dissociation limits the vibrational

level spacing is large compared to the atomic spontaneous emission width of 1.63 MHz, and

spontaneous emission can therefore be treated perturbatively.

The multichannel Hamiltonian has been set up as described in Ref. [10, 11]. The collision

between two helium atoms conserves the total molecular angular momentum J and parity

p. The total angular momentum is given by J = l + j, where l is the rotational angular

momentum and j = L+S. Here L and S are the electronic orbital and spin angular momenta

and Λ and Σ are their respective projections onto the internuclear axis. The projection of j

onto this axis is Ω = Λ + Σ. In addition, j = ja + jb, where ja and jb are the total angular
momenta of the 3S and 3P atoms, respectively. Since 4He has zero nuclear spin, p = +

and p = − parity states correspond to gerade (g) and ungerade (u) states, respectively.

The σ = g/u labels refer to the inversion symmetry of the electron wavefunctions about the

center of charge. Negative-parity bound states have contributions from even partial waves

l only. Consequently, photoassociation of two ultracold metastable helium atoms, where
s-wave collisions dominate, can only excite ungerade 3S + 3P bound states.

The twelve Born-Oppenheimer potentials are uniquely labelled by 2S+1Σ+

σ for Λ = 0 or
2S+1Πσ for |Λ| = 1, where the + superscript denotes the symmetry of the spatial electronic

wavefunction with respect to reﬂection through a plane containing the internuclear axis.
For R > 30 a0, the dispersion potentials are given by f3Λ(R/λ)C3Λ/R3 + C6Λ/R6, where f3Λ

is an R- and Λ-dependent retardation correction [12]. The quantity λ = 3258.17 a0, where
λ = λ/(2π) and λ is the 2s 3S − 2p 3P transition wavelength. The C3Σ coeﬃcient is ±2C3
and C3Π is ±C3, where C3 is 6.41022 Eha3
0 [13], Eh is a Hartree, and C3 is proportional to
the square of the 2s 3S − 2p 3P transition dipole matrix element. Following the Physical

3

Reference Database [14], we assume a 1% uncertainty or “extent of the possible error” for
this coeﬃcient. The C3Λ/R3 contributions to the potentials are attractive for the 1Σ+
u , 3Σ+
g ,
g , 1Πu, 3Πg, and 5Πu states.
u , 1Πg, 3Πu, and 5Πg states, and repulsive for the 1Σ+

The van der Waals coeﬃcients are C6Σ = 2620.76 Eha6
0 [15]. These

g , 3Σ+
0 and C6Π = 1846.60 Eha6

u , 5Σ+

can be calculated from atomic dipole moments and transition frequencies [16]. In turns out
that the C3/R3 term is the dominant contribution to the dispersion potential relevant for

the purely-long-range states.

The jb quantum number for the 2p 3P atom, which describes the spin-orbit interaction,
has the values 0,1, or 2. The 2p 3P0 and 2p 3P1 levels lie 31.9081 GHz and 2.2912 GHz
above the 2p 3P2 level, respectively [17, 18]. Note that these energy splittings do not satisfy
the Land´e intervals. The rotational Hamiltonian is given by ¯h2l2/2µR2, where µ = m/2

is the reduced mass of the system. The atomic mass is m = 4.0026032 u, where 1 u
= 1.66053873 × 10−27 kg.

We investigate the sensitivity of the bound states to the short-range Born-Oppenheimer

potentials. No data on the short-range shape currently exists, so we use two diﬀerent forms

for the short-range potentials for R < 30 a0. The ﬁrst of these short-range forms assumes

a hard wall for all twelve potentials at R = 30 a0. For smaller internuclear separations the

potentials are no longer described by the dispersion potential. For the second short-range

form, the attractive Born-Oppenheimer potentials are given a more realistic Lennard-Jones-

like form, with inner turning points between 4 a0 and 5 a0.

The molecule is best described by the Hund’s case (a) coupling scheme at small R,

where the splitting between the Born-Oppenheimer potentials is large compared to the

spin-orbit interaction. The molecular states are well described by the quantum numbers J
and 2S+1Λ±

σ . As the internuclear separation increases and the energy separation between
the Born-Oppenheimer curves becomes comparable to the atomic spin-orbit interaction, the

Hund’s case (a) coupling scheme becomes less appropriate, and the R-dependent Hund’s

case (c) coupling scheme is a more suitable choice for describing the long-range states and

potentials. The Hund’s case (c) molecular states are described by the quantum numbers J,
Ω±

σ . For Ω = 0 the ± superscript label denotes the symmetry of the electronic wavefunction

with respect to reﬂection through a plane containing the internuclear axis. We note that
for the Ω = 0 states, only 0−

g exist for even J, while the 0+

g states exist for

u and 0−

u and 0+

odd J. The Hund’s case (c) states are a linear combination of the Hund’s case (a) states.

4

Table I gives the Hund’s case (a) states that contribute to a given Hund’s case (c) state.

The purely-long-range states discussed in this paper are in the radial regime described

by the Hund’s case (c) coupling scheme. We will discuss various approximations to the

full multichannel Hamiltonian used in calculating these states. The adiabatic Movre-Pichler
model described previously labels each purely-long-range state by Ω±

σ . An improvement on

this model is the multichannel Hamiltonian that includes the Born-Oppenheimer potentials

and the spin-orbit interaction. In addition, we discuss two ways of including the nuclear

rotation. These approximate Hamiltonians are useful for assigning vibrational quantum

numbers to the bound states calculated using the full multichannel model, and the adiabatic

Movre-Pichler model is useful for conﬁrming the assignment of Hund’s case (c) labels to the

bound states.

The adiabatic Movre-Pichler potentials are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. They are obtained

using an extension of the model deﬁned in Ref. [9]. This extended Movre-Pichler model is
adapted to the 3S + 3P system and, in addition to the usual dipole-dipole and the spin-orbit
interactions, includes the C6/R6 dispersion term and retardation. As mentioned previously,
the ﬁne structure splittings for the He(2p 3P ) atom do not satisfy the Land´e intervals,

which results in a coupling between molecular singlet and quintet states. For large R, the
potentials in Figs. 1 and 2 dissociate to the three 3P ﬁne structure limits. For smaller R the

potentials correlate to attractive and repulsive Born-Oppenheimer potentials, as indicated

in the ﬁgures. We ﬁnd a number of purely-long-range potential wells in the adiabatized
potentials dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0 and 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1 atomic limits that can
u states dissociating to the 2s 3S1 +2p 3P0
support bound states. In Figs. 1 and 2 the 1g and 0+
limit provide an example of such wells, while the wells in the states dissociating to the
2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1 limit are too shallow to be observed on the scale of the present ﬁgure. There
are no purely-long-range states dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P2 limit.

The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are determined by multichannel bound state calcu-

lations in a manner similar to that described in Ref. [3]. Long-range bound states are not
“true” bound states of the system when their energy lies above the 2s 3S1+2p 3P2 dissociation

limit. They are bound states embedded in a continuum and consequently can predissociate.

In our method a hard wall is placed at a large internuclear separation, R > 5000 a0. Con-

sequently, the calculated states are either bound states or “box states”, which characterize

the continuum. These two types of states are distinguished by visual inspection of a multi-

5

channel eigenvector |Ψ(R)i = Pi ψi(R)|ii or the square root of the density (Pi |ψi(R)|2)1/2,
where the sum is over a ﬁnite number of molecular spin states |ii. The function ψi is the

radial component for spin state |ii, which is characterized by the total spin, parity, and other

angular momenta. The two types of states can also be distinguished by their sensitivity to

the location of the hard wall boundary condition. The predissociation of the bound states

will be further discussed in the next section.

III. RESULTS

Four sets of purely-long-range ro-vibrational states are found in the multichannel analysis

and the binding energies for these levels are given in Table II. We report here only levels

with binding energies greater than 1 MHz even though states bound by less than twice the

atomic line width, 3.25 MHz, may not be clearly observable. The levels are characterized
using Hund’s case (c) labels. The 1g and 0+
u potentials dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0
limit and the 0−
u and 2u potentials dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1 limit have purely-long-
range states. Each of these potentials has no more than 6 vibrational levels. These levels are
labelled by v and exhibit a rotational progression when J ≥ Ω. In addition, 0+

u ) states
only exist for J odd (even). The uncertainty in the binding energy due to changing the short-

u (0−

range Born-Oppenheimer potentials is negligible. The last signiﬁcant digit of the binding

energy indicates the predissociation width, an estimate of which is obtained by comparing

the energies for varying locations of the hard wall at large R. We ﬁnd the predissociation

width is on the order of, or smaller than, the natural line width. Gerade/ungerade symmetry

states can only be formed by photoassociation via odd/even partial wave collisions. At the

internuclear separations of relevance to the states described here, retardation corrections

that introduce dipole-forbidden coupling between gerade and ungerade states [19] are small.

As shown in Table II for the lowest allowed rotational level of each state, the 1% extent

of the error on C3 produces a change of less than 1 MHz for the 1g bound states dissociating
to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0 limit and the 0−
u and 2u bound states dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1
u bound states dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0 limit, changes of up to 4
limit. For the 0+
MHz are found for the v = 0 to v = 3 levels. The higher vibrational levels are shifted by less

than 1 MHz. These changes are obtained using a ﬁxed location of the hard wall at large R.

It is necessary to include retardation as it leads to a small correction in the binding energy.

6

For the deepest purely-long-range potential, the 0+

u dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0 limit,
the retardation correction lowers the bound state energy of the J = 1, v = 0 ro-vibrational
level by approximately 7 MHz. The complete C6/R6 contribution to the bottom of this 0+
u

well at R ≈ 190 a0 is approximately 0.4 MHz. Therefore the shift in the binding energy due

to any uncertainty in C6 is small compared with the natural line width.

We look at three examples to clarify the ro-vibrational and Hund’s case (c) assignments

of the levels reported in Table II. In Fig. 3 we show the binding energies for J = 2, v = 0 to
v = 3 ro-vibrational levels of the 2u state dissociating to the He(2 3S1)+He(2 3P1) limit for

four approximations and the exact multichannel calculation. The four approximations are:

(A) the adiabatic extended Movre-Pichler approximation, (B) a non-rotating multichannel

calculation including the Born-Oppenheimer potentials and the atomic spin-orbit interac-

tion, (C) an adiabatic calculation of the full J = 2 Hamiltonian where the Coriolis coupling
between diﬀerent Ω±
full J = 2 Hamiltonian where the Coriolis coupling between diﬀerent Ω±

u states has been set to zero, and (D) a multichannel calculation of the

u states has been set

to zero. The binding energies labelled by (E) are obtained using a multichannel calculation of

the full J = 2 Hamiltonian. All four approximations predict the correct binding energies to

within 10%. Experiments are suﬃciently accurate that the full multichannel model must be

used. For the v = 0 level, the 4.9 MHz diﬀerence between approximations (A) and (B) is due

to the positive diagonal non-adiabatic coupling, which depends on the Born-Oppenheimer

and spin-orbit interactions [20]. The 21 MHz discrepancy between the two adiabatic approx-

imations (A) and (C) for the v = 0 level can qualitatively be understood by the perturbative
inclusion of the ¯h2l2/(2µR2) rotational Hamiltonian. For this Hund’s case (c) 2u state the
l2 of the rotational Hamiltonian simpliﬁes to J(J + 1) − 2Ω2 + j(j + 1) = J(J + 1) − 2,
since j = Ω = 2 near the He(2 3S1)+He(2 3P1) dissociation limit. Clearly, for the lowest ro-

tational level J = 2, a non-zero rotational correction occurs. A non-pertubative calculation

is needed for a quantitative understanding of the discrepancy between the two adiabatic ap-

proximations (A) and (C) as rotational distortions are important. Similar to the diﬀerence

between approximations (A) and (B), the diﬀerence between approximations (C) and (D) is

also due to a positive diagonal non-adiabatic coupling, which now depends on the rotational

Hamiltonian as well as the Born-Oppenheimer and spin-orbit interactions. In this case, the

comparison of approximation (D) with (E) shows that the coupling between Ω states shifts

the J = 2, 2u levels by no more than 0.5 MHz. Similar comparisons can be obtained for all

7

of the purely-long-range states.

In Fig. 4 we show the square root of the density for exact J = 2 multichannel wave-

functions assigned with the 2u and 0−
u adiabatic
potentials dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1 limit, as obtained using the approximation (C)

u symmetries. Also shown are the 2u and 0−

described previously. These bound levels are purely-long-range because the square roots of

the densities show no amplitude for R < 250 a0. In addition, the square roots of the densities

calculated using the full multichannel and adiabatic models do not deviate appreciably. A

clear vibrational progression from the v = 0 to the v = 1 level of the 2u state is visible.

The square root of the density calculated using the full Hamiltonian for three J = 1, 1g
bound levels and two J = 1, 1g adiabatic potentials dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1 limit

are shown in Fig. 5. The two potentials are calculated using approximation (C). The “deep”

1g potential has a double-well structure with a minimum at ≈ 315 a0. The other “shallow”

potential has a minimum at ≈ 530 a0. These levels have not been tabulated in Table II

because they are sensitive to the short-range potentials. We present them here as they

are seemingly purely-long-range except for the penetration of the wavefunction through

the barrier of the double-well potentials. The peak of the barrier lies slightly above the
2s 3S1+2p 3P1 dissociation limit. The “shallow” potential is not a purely-long-range potential

because of signiﬁcant non-adiabatic mixing with the “deep” 1g potential. This short-range

dependence leads to an uncertainty in the level locations and possible broadening by Penning

ionization processes. In addition, the square root of the density for the v = 0 level has an

oscillatory behavior for R > 700 a0. The periodicity of these oscillations corresponds to the

periodicity of the square root of the density for box states in close proximity to the v = 0

level. For these 1g states the amplitude of the oscillations is primarily determined by the

rotational coupling. These oscillations indicate signiﬁcant predissociation.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have predicted the binding energies of all four sets of purely-long-range ro-vibrational
levels of 4He(2s 3S) + 4He(2p 3P ) potentials dissociating to the 2s 3S1 + 2p 3P0,1 ﬁne structure

limits. A comparison of the results calculated using the full multichannel and approximate

models demonstrates that the full multichannel Hamiltonian is required for accurate com-

parison with experiment. Retardation and the van der Waals C6 interaction are found to give

8

rise to small corrections in the binding energies. We show that a measurement of the binding

energy to at least 1 MHz leads to a 1% determination of the dipole-dipole C3 coeﬃcient.

The current measurements of the 5Σ+

g scattering length of colliding metastable 4He atoms
are 300 ± 150 a0 [5] and 380 ± 190 a0 [4]. This implies that a node in the scattering wave-

function can be found between 150 a0 and 600 a0

[3]. The inner and outer turning points

of our purely-long-range bound states approximately fall within this range of internuclear

separations. Consequently the intensity patterns as a function of vibrational level in pho-

toassociation spectroscopy may provide an improved measurement of the scattering length.

The experimental and theoretical binding energies for the 0+

u state dissociating to the
2s 3S1 + 2p 3P1 limit reported in Ref. [21] came to our attention upon the completion of this

paper. Our theoretical predictions are within the experimental uncertainty for the v = 1 − 4

levels and for the v = 0 level our theoretical prediction of −1418.1 MHz is 2 MHz greater

than the upper bound on the experimental binding energy −1430 ± 10 MHz.

FIG. 2: Adiabatic extended Movre-Pichler potentials of ungerade symmetry as a function of inter-

nuclear separation. The zero of energy is the He(2s 3S1)+He(2p 3P2) atomic limit. The potentials
are labelled by Ω±

u . At short-range we have indicated with ellipses the 2S+1Λ+

u correlations.

FIG. 3: The binding energy of the v = 0 to v = 3 vibrational levels of the purely-long-range 2u
potential dissociating to the He(2s 3S1)+He(2p 3P1) limit. Various approximations to the complete

multichannel model are shown. Working from a basic model and increasing in complexity to the

complete multichannel calculation: (A) the adiabatic extended Movre-Pichler approximation, (B)

a multichannel calculation including the Born-Oppenheimer potentials and the atomic spin-orbit

interaction, (C) an adiabatic calculation of the full J = 2 Hamiltonian where the Coriolis coupling
between diﬀerent Ω±
Hamiltonian where the Coriolis coupling between diﬀerent Ω±

u states has been set to zero, (D) a multichannel calculation of the full J = 2

u states has been set to zero, and (E)

the complete J = 2 multichannel calculation.

FIG. 4: The square root of the density for the J = 2, v = 0 and v = 1 ro-vibrational levels of the
2u state and the J = 2, v′ = 0 ro-vibrational level of the 0−

u state. Note that for the lower two

levels the square root of the density curves have been inverted to maintain the distinguishability of
the curves. The solid grey curves represent the adiabatic J = 2, 2u and 0−
u potentials dissociating
to the He(2s 3S1)+He(2p 3P1) limit. The binding energies of the levels are illustrated by dashed

horizontal lines.

FIG. 5: The square root of the density for the J = 1, v = 0 and v = 1 ro-vibrational levels
of the deep 1g state and the J = 1, v′ = 0 ro-vibrational level of the shallow 1g state. Note

that for the lower two levels the square root of the density curves have been inverted to maintain

the distinguishability of the curves. The solid grey curves represent the adiabatic J = 1, 1g

potentials dissociating to the He(2s 3S1)+He(2p 3P1) limit. The density shows signiﬁcant amplitude

for internuclear separations less than 200 a0. The binding energies of the levels are illustrated by

dashed horizontal lines.

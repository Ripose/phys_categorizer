Abstract

We have calculated the diﬀerential and integrated cross sections for excitation of atomic hydrogen

to its n = 3 and n = 4 levels by electron impact using the Glauber approximation. Results are

compared with measurements at 20, 30, 40, and 60 eV and also shown for 120 and 480 eV. At

momentum transfers not too large at all energies considered, the calculated n = 3 diﬀerential cross

sections are qualitatively similar to but a factor of somewhat less than 3 larger than the calculated

n = 4 cross sections. The calculated integrated cross sections attain broad maxima near 41 eV.

Only relatively recently have considerably accurate theoretical methods for describing

electron-hydrogen atom scattering been presented [1, 2, 3, 4]. These methods require

very-large-scale calculations or involved computations such as six-dimensional numerical

quadrature. It would be useful to be able to calculate electron-hydrogen cross sections with

ease without sacriﬁcing too much of the accuracy of the established reliable methods. The

ﬁrst-Born approximation is perhaps the most easily utilized scattering approximation, but

its validity is questionable except at rather high incident energies. And furthermore, the

convergence of the Born approximation to the correct nonrelativistic result may occur only

at such high energies that relativistic eﬀects become signiﬁcant [5].

An approximation which has been used extensively with much success in nuclear physics

(and with moderate success in atomic physics) is the Glauber approximation [6]. This

approximation is expected to be valid at high incident energies and small momentum

transfers. It was introduced to atomic physics in 1968 [7], and is as easy to use today as

the Born approximation was then. With a laptop personal computer, complete numerical

calculations, in most cases, take of the order of a second.

The Glauber approximation amplitude, f (1s

nlm; q), for excitation of the (nlm) level
of atomic hydrogen by electrons with incident momentum ~k and ﬁnal momentum ~kf is

Equation (1) shows that the cross section is given in terms of a linear combination of

products of (complex) powers of q and derivatives of hypergeometric functions. If one uses

the diﬀerentiation and recursion relations satisﬁed by the hypergeometric function [9], the

full result may be expressed in terms of only two contiguous hypergeometric functions and

simple functions of q. No advantage is gained, however, by explicitly exhibiting the results

in that form since the algebra involved is very tedious and the forms of the simple functions

of q are quite complicated, lengthy, and not at all transparent. It is more useful to express

the results directly in terms of derivatives with respect to z of the z−iη

2F1 function in Eq.

(1). Closed form expressions in terms of such derivatives are then obtained.

Equations (1) and (2) may be used to calculate cross sections for excitation of ground

state atomic hydrogen to any excited state. We present the explicit results for excitation

to the n = 3 and n = 4 levels.

These relatively simple explicit analytic expressions may be used to calculate the

diﬀerential cross sections for excitation of ground state hydrogen atoms to the n = 3 and

n = 4 states. As can be seen, each may be found by writing a single (albeit somewhat
lengthy) statement. Using Mathematica, for example, the entire calculation may be done

with one few-line input statement and the time required on a PC for the entire diﬀerential

cross section is of the order of a second.

We have calculated the diﬀerential cross sections for the 1s

excitations using Eqs.(2-4) at energies of 20 eV, 30 eV, 40 eV, and 60 eV, where measure-

ments have been recently made [10]. We have also calculated these cross sections at 120 eV

and 480 eV, where the theory has greater validity. Since the theory is valid at high energies

and small momentum transfers, one would not expect accurate results for large momentum

transfers (large scattering angles). However, at high energies the cross sections decrease

rapidly from their values near the forward direction and the bulk of the scattering occurs

at small momentum transfers.

At energies as low as 20

60 eV use of the Glauber approximation would not be justiﬁed

if one required highly accurate results. But even at these low energies, one might expect to

obtain qualitative results at the lower momentum transfers. We present the results of our

calculations for momentum transfers of q

1.24kf , and our comparison of the theory with

the measurements is exhibited in that domain. Larger momentum transfers are beyond the

range of validity of the theory (which does not compare well with the large-q data [10], as

expected).

measurements (SGS) [10] which, for the three highest energies, decrease by factors of as

much as 50 to 200 from their values at the smallest measured momentum transfers. Our

results are in reasonable agreement with the data, even at these relatively low energies.

Both the theory and the measurements indicate that the n = 3 and n = 4 diﬀerential cross

sections are qualitatively very similar, with the former being a factor of somewhat less than

3 larger than the latter. At larger momentum transfers (not shown), where the theory is not

valid, the calculated cross sections continue to decrease rapidly. Where measurements have

In Fig.3 we show the calculated results at energies of 120 eV and 480 eV, where the

approximation has greater validity. These results exhibit the same similarities of the

n = 3 and n = 4 cross sections as those exhibited at the lower energies, with the n = 3

throughout the entire domain of momentum transfers shown.

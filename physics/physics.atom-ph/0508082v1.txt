We use the classical ﬁelds approximation to study a translational ﬂow of the condensate with
respect to the thermal cloud in a weakly interacting Bose gas. We study both, subcritical and
supercritical relative velocity cases and analyze in detail a state of stationary ﬂow which is reached
in the dynamics. This state corresponds to the thermal equilibrium, which is characterized by the
relative velocity of the condensate and the thermal cloud. The superﬂuidity manifests itself in the
existence of many thermal equilibria varying in (the value of this velocity) the relative velocity
between the condensate and the thermal cloud. We pay a particular attention to excitation spectra
in a phonon as well as in a particle regime. Finally, we introduce a measure of the amount of the
superﬂuid fraction in a weakly interacting Bose gas, allowing for the precise distinction between the
superﬂuid and the condensed fractions in a single and consistent framework.

INTRODUCTION

The tendency of liquid helium-4 cooled below 2.19 K to
ﬂow without any apparent friction is known for decades
[1, 2, 3]. This superﬂuid behavior is commonly associ-
ated with the phenomenon of a Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion [4]. The connection has been mostly based on the
similarities in the nature of both phenomena, as both
are a large-scale manifestations of the quantum nature.
However, the detailed theoretical investigation of super-
ﬂuidity and condensation in liquid helium [5] is a great
challenge, as it is a strongly interacting quantum system
and cannot be eﬀectively described with a mean-ﬁeld or
perturbative approaches. The present-date understand-
ing of superﬂuidity comes from the paper of L. Landau
[6].

Experimental achievement of Bose-Einstein conden-
sates in dilute trapped atomic gases [7, 8, 9] gives a
unique possibility to study their superﬂuid properties un-
der condition of very weak interactions. It has opened
an opportunity for revisiting the concept of superﬂuid-
ity. In this context the issue of the atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate under rotation has attracted great interest
[10]. It has been demonstrated experimentally that Bose-
Einstein condensate circulates around quantized vortex

of these vortices and the properties of scissor modes
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] are considered the main manifes-
tations of superﬂuidity. On the other hand, a little is
known about superﬂuidity in a translational motion of
the atomic condensate [16, 17, 18]. There are still no ex-
periments that would correspond to the demonstration of
frictionless non-rotary ﬂow, which is the most intuitive
manifestation of this phenomenon.

Dilute atomic Bose gases are simpler to describe than
liquid helium, with many succesful implementations of
mean-ﬁeld theories.
It is a purpose of this paper to
present a simple model of superﬂuidity in a weakly inter-

acting Bose gas using the classical ﬁelds approximation.
The classical ﬁelds approximation is the non-perturbative
mean-ﬁeld model of a Bose-Einstein condensate at ﬁ-
nite temperatures.
It turned out to be very success-
ful in describing dynamical and thermodynamic prop-
erties of atomic condensates and their excitation spectra
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. It allows a description of the con-
densate and a thermal cloud treating both components
on equal footing without any arbitrary splitting of the
system into two parts.

In Section II we brieﬂy describe the classical ﬁelds ap-
proximation. For ease of calculations we restrict our-
selves to a simpliﬁed geometry of 3D box with peri-
odic boundary conditions. Then we prepare initial states
which will allow us to study the relative motion of the
condensate and the thermal cloud.

In Section III we present numerical results. We ﬁnd
that the ﬂow is indeed frictionless below the Landau crit-
ical velocity c and that the stationary state depends on
yet another control parameter - namely the relative ve-
locity between the condensate and the thermal cloud.
We believe that in this paper we are extracting for the
ﬁrst time the basic properties of the superﬂuid ﬂow in
direct numerical simulation of the dynamics. We ob-
tain the excitation spectra of such a superﬂuid system
and observe the equipartition of energies in quasiparti-
cle modes, which has been previously found in case of
a stationary BEC [19, 24]. We also notice pulling of
Bogoliubov quasiparticles by the condensate during the
thermalization period.

In Section IV we analyze the properties of Bogoliubov
quasiparticles. We derive analitically excitation spectra
of the system, obtaining results that agree with our nu-
merical simulations. We analyze the transformation of
quasiparticle momentum under Galilean transformations
and ﬁnd that it behaves as a particle of mass m, simi-
larly to atoms in the system and unlike acoustic waves.
This allows us to directly relate superﬂuid and condensed

fractions, what produces surprisingly simple formula in
the case of 3D box. We base our reasoning on the ob-
servation that Bogoliubov quasiparticles are the normal
modes of the system [19] and we associate with them the
normal (non-superﬂuid) fraction, similarly to Landau. In
Section V we conclude.

II. THE METHOD

We consider a weakly-interacting Bose gas consisting
of N atoms conﬁned in a 3D box potential with periodic
boundary conditions. The atoms interact via a contact

where L is the size of the box, m is the mass of an
atom and ˆΨ is a bosonic ﬁeld operator satisfying equal
time bosonic commutation relation [ ˆΨ(r, t), ˆΨ†(r′, t)] =
r′). The corresponding Heisenberg equation for

We expand the ﬁeld operator in the basis of plane waves:

ˆak destroy particle in mode k and satisfy a commutation
relation [ˆak, ˆa†k′] = δk,k′.

P

Now we apply the classical ﬁelds approximation [21, 22,
23, 25, 26]. For all modes that are occupied by suﬃciently
large number of atoms we subtitute annihilation opera-
√N αk. After neglecting all
tors with c-numbers: ˆak

where g = aN/πL is the interaction strength and ǫ =
4π2~2/mL2 is our unit of energy (the corresponding unit
of time is ~/ǫ).

The wavefunction ψ represents here both the conden-
sate and the thermal cloud, contrary to the typical in-
terpretation of the GP equation where ψ is just the con-
densate wavefunction. A measurement, which introduces
a coarse-graining is essential for distinguishing between

2

these two fractions. Populations of various modes can
be extracted from diagonalization of the time-averaged
density matrix [22, 27] and the dominant eigenvalue rep-
resents the condensed fraction. The time-averaging de-
stroys the coherence between the modes and leads to a
mixed state out of a pure state
. The wave-
|
function ψ(t) can be interpreted as a single experimental
realization of evolving system.

To obtain a stationary solution corresponding to non-
zero temperature we start with the ground state wave-
function and randomize its phase. The system evolves
towards a thermal equilibrium, which depends only on
the total energy per particle E, the interaction strength g
and the length of the box L [22]. The condensate appears
in the zero momentum mode and atoms in the remaining
modes compose a thermal cloud. The dependence of the
resulting state on the interaction strength g = aN/πL
instead of a and N separately results in an ambiguity. In
order to assign the temperature T to our system in a way
independent of the choice of the numerical grid we use a
scheme developed in [25]; we assign temperature to tem-
perature of the ideal gas that has the same condensate
fraction.

In the considered case of the box potential eigenmodes
of the stationary single-particle density matrix can be
only composed of modes with the same
, due to sym-
|
metry constrains. Thus the plane waves set a natural
basis. As it turns out, modes k combine with modes
-k to create Bogoliubov quasiparticles of amplitude δk,
which evolve with a single dominant frequency (the rala-
tion between δk and αk will be derived in Section IV).
Bogoliubov quasiparticles are the normal modes of the
system [19]; for high momenta, when the kinetic energy
is much larger than the interaction energy, they become
indistinguishable from atomic modes αk.

In a stationary case the central energies of quasiparti-

cles are given by [19]:

ǫk = µ + ǫ

ω(k)2

p

−

where ω(k) = k2
2 + gnc is introduced for simplicity and
nc is the condensate fraction. µ is the frequency of the
condensate mode and has an interpretation of the chem-
ical potential. Similarly to the case of He-II they have
a phonon-like spectrum at low momenta (see Fig. 5 in
[19]). In the classical ﬁelds approximation quasiparticles
obey the equipartition of energies [19], suggesting that
the system is in a thermal equilibrium and not just in
a steady state. Note, however, that the condensate it-
self is not populated according to the equipartition. For
parameters considered in our paper the Bose statistics
leads to the equipartition for the considered Bogoliubov
quasiparticles, suggesting that thermodynamics should
be studied in quasiparticle and not atomic modes.

The solutions discussed here represent the situation in
which the condensate does not move with respect to the
thermal cloud. In order to study the possible superﬂuid
ﬂow we need to put the condensate in motion. In our nu-
merical simulations we take a stationary state described

above and apply a momentum kick to the condensate.
The remaining atoms are pushed in the opposite direc-
tion, so that the total momentum of the system is close
to zero [33]. We can also apply the momentum kick to
any arbitrary number of modes, in particular to the con-
desnate along with surrounding modes which merge into
quasiparticles (phonon modes).

In our simulations we take stationary solutions for ca.
60000 atoms and the scattering length of 18 nm, conﬁned
in a box of lenght 5 µm, with the condensate popula-
tions of 65% and 8%. The temperatures are 580 nK and
1 µK, respectively. We apply the procedure described
above, controlling the initial relative velocity v of the two
fractions, by placing the condensate in a chosen mode
kc. The resulting states are composed of the condensate
(possibly with some surrounding atomic modes) and the
remaining thermal cloud ﬂowing in opposite directions.
These states are arbitrarily prepared and no longer rep-
resent an equilibrium of the system - they should experi-
ence some thermalization.

Can we observe any frictionless (superﬂuid) ﬂow be-

tween the two fractions?

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The steady state depends on the initial relative ve-
locity v between the condensate and the thermal cloud.
There exists a critical velocity c = 2π~
mL √gnc which sepa-
rates two regimes; nc is the new equilibrium condensate
fraction. For a system with 65% (8%) of the condensate
initially the resulting nc is approximatelly 50% (1.5%)
for velocities lower than c. For relative velocities v be-
low the critical velocity c the condensate remains ﬂowing
with respect to the thermal cloud. No drag due to ther-
mal atoms is experienced and the ﬂow is superﬂuid (Fig.
1). Note the initial thermalization. We have observed
that during this transient period the phonon modes are
being dragged along with the condensate. Initially push-
ing low-excited modes along with the condensate reduces
this time and increases the equilibrium condensate frac-
tion (see inset in Fig. 1).

Above the critical velocity the condensate experiences
a drag from thermal atoms and slows down. The conden-
sate population slips to a slower moving mode (Fig. 2).
Close to the critical velocity the system is unstable. Slips
will occur at diﬀerent times, depending on the particular
realization of the initial conditions (Fig. 3). Bundling
phonon modes with the condensate results in stabilizing
the near-critical ﬂow. This is due to an increase in the
resulting equilibrium condensate fraction which shifts the
critical velocity slightly upwards.

The excitation spectrum of quasiparticles of the sys-
tem with the condensate in kc mode has been plotted in
Figure 4. It can be well described by (see below):

condensate are shifted upwards, and moving slower than
the condensate are shifted downwards with respect to the
stationary state, due to the Doppler-like shift (the last
term in Formula 3.1). Note, that numerically obtained
spectra of quasiparticles have ﬁnite width, which can be
interpreted as the their ﬁnite life-time [19]. Still, the
quasiparticles obey the equipartition of energies. Their
populations nδk = δ∗kδk and energies ǫk fulﬁll a formula:

nδk(ǫk

µ) = kBT,

−

(3.2)

as can be seen in Figure 5a. This indicates that the
system undergoing a superﬂuid ﬂow is in a thermal equi-
librium. However, the equipartition occurs not in the
condensate nor the thermal cloud’s frame, but in the
center-of-mass frame instead.

Please confront the relation 3.2 with a similar one ob-
tained for atomic populations nk = α∗kαk (Fig. 5b),
which do not obey the equipartition. For phonon modes,
where quasiparticles diﬀer signiﬁcantly from atoms, their
populations are smaller than relative atomic populations.
For starting nc = 8% the critical velocity corresponds
to a momentum lower than the momentum of the k =
(1, 0, 0) mode and thus any motion of the condensate with
respect to the thermal cloud results in a friction.

Within our accuracy the observed critical velocity is
identical with the one obtained from Landau’s criterion
[6] applied to the excitation spectrum in the stationary
case (Formula 2.5). Note, however, that even for subcrit-
ical velocities there exist thermal atoms that move super-
critically with respect to the condensate. Applying the
Landau criterion to each quasiparticle separately would

FIG. 2: Population of the condensate versus time for a super-
critical ﬂow. The starting relative velocity of the condensate
and the thermal cloud is v = 1.17c (a) and v = 1.75c (b). The
mode initially occupied by the condensate becomes depleted
due to friction with the thermal cloud (I) and the condensate
reappears in a slower moving mode (II). Note, that in (a) the
condensate is directly transferred to the neighbouring momen-
tum state, where it ﬂows with a stationary relative velocity
v = 0.46c with respect to the thermal cloud. On the contrary
in (b), where the initial velocity is very high, the ﬂow is much
more complicated. The condensate population smears into
multiple modes to ﬁnally agregate in a mode whose relative
velocity equals v = 0.52c.
In the transient time many suc-
ceeding slips may occur, as the condensate slows down gradu-
ally. As a result of these slips the stationary relative velocity
of the condensate and the thermal cloud is subcritical. The
equilibrium condensate population is 47.9% in (a) and 42.9%
in (b).

always result in a net drag force, as there is more super-
critical atoms moving opposite to the condensate than
supercritical atoms moving along with the condensate.

The manifestation of superﬂuidity in our model is the
existence of many thermal equilibria, all varying in the
relative velocity between the condensate and the thermal
cloud. Such a velocity is an additional control parameter.
Please note that we have not yet presented any quanti-
tative measure of the amount of the superﬂuid fraction.
In the next section we present analytical discussion and
derive the formula for the superﬂuid population.

IV. ANALITICAL RESULTS

We consider here Bogoliubov excitations at non-zero
temperature. The starting point of our investigation will
be Eq. 2.2 for the Bose ﬁeld operator ˆΨ. Let us choose
a reference frame in which the condesate is in kc mode.
Changing kc will be interpreted for a while as changing

the reference frame. We decompose ˆΨ into a basis of
plane waves:

It is a non-linear operator equation. We linearize it in
a way similar to the Bogoliubov-Popov approximation.
For certain elements in the sum in Eq. 4.2 we group

ate mean values. And thus, terms a†kak are replaced with

are still non-linear in operators, are neglected. Results
from [19] suggest that this approximates the full dynam-

temperatures close to the critical temperature, limiting
the scope of our analysis.

They agree with values obtained from the numerical sim-
ulations. However the calculated value of the chemical
potential µ agrees rather with the Formula 14 of [19]
than with the simpliﬁed Equation 4.3. The diﬀerence,
however, shifts the whole energy spectrum only. Note,
that this simpliﬁed approach ignores the ﬁnite width
(which determines the life-time) of the quasiparticle spec-
tra, which we observe in our numerical simulations.

We can also perform an inverse Bogoliubov transofma-

tion. It is:

and the resulting atomic populations are:

k < ˆδ†k ˆδk > +V 2

The resulting Bogoliubov quasiparticles δk have mo-
menta pδk = ~(k + kc) and their coeﬃcients Uk and Vk
are independent of the choice of the reference frame (kc).
Thus they transform under Galilean transform as parti-
cles of mass m, similarly to atoms in our system.

Let us now switch to the semi-classical model again,
αk
by substituting c-numbers for the operators (ˆa′k
and ˆδk
δk). By doing this we neglect the antinormal
ordering of ˆδk in Formula 4.11, which accounts for the
quantum depletion. On the other hand we can relate
the results to our numerical simulations, allowing us to
calculate the amount of superﬂuid fraction.

In this semi-classical approach Formula 4.11 takes the

form:

nk = U 2

knδk + V 2

k nδ−k,

(4.12)

where nδk = δ∗kδk are quasiparticle populations. Assum-
ing we know quasiparticle populations we can calculate
populations of atomic modes with this formula. They
are greater than the corresponding quasiparticle popula-
tions due to U 2
1. These analitical calculations agree
k
with our numerical results (see Fig. 5b for comparison of
atomic populations).

In order to identify the superﬂuid part we consider the
total momentum P of the system. It can be naturally
expressed as a sum over momenta of individual atoms:

P = ~N 

nckc +

nk(k + kc)

= Pc + PT ,

(4.13)

Xk

where atoms contribute either to the momentum of the
condensate Pc or to the momentum of the thermal cloud
PT (for k

= 0).

On the other hand quasiparticles have a well-deﬁned
momenta too and they are also the observed excitations
that can be measured experimentally [29, 30, 31]. Their

agregate momentum is Pδ = N ~
we can express the total momentum P :

P = Pδk + PSF .

An additional momentum PSF appears here to account
for the conservation of momentum. Because Pδ and P
are physically observable PSF should have some physical
meaning. Applying the inverse Bogoliubov transforma-
tion (4.12) to atomic populations and using the relations
for Uk and Vk one can show that:

densate velocity. This mass represents condensed atoms
along with a part of thermal cloud ”freezed out” by the
interaction.

We have decomposed the system into two parts - one
composed of excitations of the system and another one
moving with the condensate speed. Applying the Landau
criterion to such a system we conclude that the nSF =
1
nδ is indeed the superﬂuid fraction, as indicated by the
subscript we used, and Bogoliubov quasiparticles form
the normal fraction in the system (nδ).

−

In other words the superﬂuid fraction is a sum of the
condensate and atoms which do not take part in forming
quasiparticles (which are thermally distributed). Thus
atoms occupying highly excited modes do not contribute
to the superﬂuid part, as for these modes quasiparticles
are almost the same as atomic modes. Note that the su-
perﬂuid fraction adds up with quasiparticles to the total
number of atoms in the system, even though Bogoliubov
quasiparticles do not obey the conservation of their num-
ber.

Due to the bosonic nature of Bogoliubov quasiparti-
cles the superﬂuid fraction is greater than the condensate
fraction and the diﬀerence increases with the interaction
strength g. In our numerical simulations it is for exam-
ple nSF = 60.4% compared to nc = 53.4% for relative
velocity v = 0.82c between fractions.

We can apply the same reasoning without restricting
ourselves to the semi-classical description of atoms and
quasiparticles. The same scheme applied to a system
with quantum corrections taken into consideration shows
that even at zero temperature the superﬂuid fraction is
100% even though the condensed fraction is smaller than
that. Because the quantum depletion originates from the
reversed order of δk in the inverse Bogoliubov transform,

Even though such a basic model suﬀers from a diver-

pletion belongs to the superﬂuid fraction.

additional control parameter characterizing the thermal
equilibrium.

We have obtained the excitation spectrum of the sys-
tem and we have analyzed in detail properties of Bo-
goliubov quasiparticles, obtaining an agreement between
numerical and analitical calculations.

The superﬂuid fraction has been identiﬁed from the
momentum transformation rules and an application of
the Landau criterion.
It turns out to be the conden-
sate plus atoms from the excited modes which do not
participate in the collective excitations of the system.
These atoms can be viewed as bound to the condensate
by the interactions. The results provide analitical for-
mula for a diﬀerence between superﬂuid and condensed
parts at any temperature and within a consistent and
non-perturbative description. They also show that one
does not require a strongly-interacting Helium-II, with
its roton part of the spectrum and essential many-body
interactions, to make this diﬀerence signiﬁcant.

In our approach it is also evident that quantum deple-
tion occuring in a weakly-interacting Bose gas is also a
part of the superﬂuid fraction, so that even at 0K there is
a diﬀerence between superﬂuid and condensed fractions
- again similarly to He-II.

The temperature dependent Bogoliubov-Popov spec-
trum, together with our approach to superﬂuidity can
form a basis for equilibrium statistical physics of inter-
acting Bose gas at non-zero temperature. Such a study
will be presented elsewhere [32].

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a model of superﬂu-
idity of a weakly-interacting Bose gas within the classi-

In the direct numerical sim-
ulation of the dynamics we have shown that below the
Landau critical velocity c = 2π~

of the condensate with respect to the thermal cloud is
superﬂuid and that the resulting state is in a thermal
equilibrium. The relative velocity of this superﬂow is an

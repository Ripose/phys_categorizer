Half-cycle laser pulse is applied on an absorbed molecule to investigate its alignment and orien-
tation behavior. Crossover from ﬁeld-free to hindered rotation motion is observed by varying the
angel of hindrance of potential well. At small hindered angle, both alignment and orientation show
sinusoidal-like behavior because of the suppression of higher excited states. However, mean align-
ment decreases monotonically as the hindered angle is increased, while mean orientation displays a
minimum point at certain hindered angle. The reason is attributed to the symmetry of wavefunction
and can be explained well by analyzing the coeﬃcients of eigenstates.

ent well-dependent signatures between the alignment and
orientation of the hindered molecule under an ultrashort
laser pulse are pointed out for the ﬁrst time. Crossover
from ﬁeld-free to hindered rotation is also observed by
varying the hindered angle of potential well. These make
our results promising and may be useful in understanding
the molecule-surface interactions.

Alignment and orientation of molecules are important
in the investigations of stereodynamics [1], surface catal-
ysis [2], molecular focusing [3], and nanoscale design [4].
The alignment scheme has been demonstrated both in
adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes. A strong laser pulse
can adiabatically create pendular states, and the molec-
ular axis is aligned in parallel to the direction of ﬁeld
polarization. The molecule goes back to its initial con-
dition after the laser pulse is switched of, and the align-
ment can no longer be observed again[5]. To achieve
adiabatic alignment, the duration of laser pulse must be
longer than the rotational period. However, an ultrashort
laser pulse with several cycles is also observed to induce a
ﬁeld-free alignment providing the duration of laser pulse
is smaller than the rotational period. In this limit, the
alignment occurs periodically in time as long as the co-
herence of the process is preserved [6]. On the other
hand, a femtosecond laser pulse is found to be able to
generate ﬁeld-free orientations [7]. The dipole molecule,
kicked by an impulsive pulse, will tend to orient in the
direction of laser polarization. Laser-indued molecular
orientations have been demonstrated in several experi-
ments [8, 9, 10].

Recently, the rotational motion of a molecule inter-
acting with a solid surface has attracted increasing in-
terest.
It is known that molecules can be desorbed
by applying UV laser beam along the surface direction,
and the quadrupole is a measure of the rotational align-
ment [11]. To understand molecular-surface interaction,
Gadzuk and his co-workers [12] proposed an inﬁnite-
conical-well model, in which the adsorbed molecule is
only allowed to rotate within the well region. Shih et
al.
further proposed a ﬁnite-conical-well model to gen-
eralize the study of a ﬁnite hindrance [13]. Their results
showed that the rotational states of an adsorbed dipole
molecule in an external electric ﬁeld exhibit interesting
behaviors, and theoretical calculation of the quadrupole
moment based on ﬁnite-conical-well model is in agree-
ment with the experimental data [14]. These ﬁndings
may be great useful for understanding the surface reac-
tion.

In the present work we present a detailed investigations
on the rotational motion of a polar diatomic molecule,
which is conﬁned by a hindering conical-well. Diﬀer-

FIG. 1: Schematic view of the hindered rotor.

Consider now a laser pulse polarizing in z-direction in-
teracts with the hindered molecule as shown in Fig.1.
The model Hamiltonian can be written as

H = −

J 2 + Vhin(θ, φ) + HI ,

(1)

¯h2
2I

where J 2 and I are angular momentum and momentum
of inertia of the molecule. The rotational constant B
is set equal to ¯h2
2I . It is reasonable to assume that the
surface potential Vhin(θ, φ) is independent of φ since pre-
vious calculations have shown that its dependence on φ
is weaker than that on θ [15, 16, 17]. Therefore, in the
vertical absorbed conﬁguration, the surface potential can

be written as [12]

and alignment
We choose ICl as our model molecule, whose dipole mo-

ment µ is equal to 1.24 Debye and its rotational constant
1 for ground state. The peak intensity and
B is 0.114 cm−
frequency of laser pulse is about 5 × 1011 W/cm2 and 210
1, respectively. The rotor is in ground state initially.

The solid lines in the insets of Fig. 2 show the depen-
dence of the alignment on hindered angle α. For α = 60◦,
sinusoidal-like behavior is presented, and the alignment
ranges from 0.63 to 0.91. As the hindered angle increases,
the curves become more and more complicated and grad-
ually approach the free rotor limit as shown in the insets
of Fig. 2 (b) (α = 120◦) and 1 (c) (α = 180◦). This can
be understood well by studying the populations |cl,m|2 of
low-lying states. In the regime of small hindered angle,
there is little chance for electron to populate in higher ex-
cited states since the shrinking of the conical-well angle
causes the increasing of energy spacings.

One also notes that the populations of a hindered
molecule for α = 60◦ and 120◦, shown in Fig. 2 (a)
and (b), mainly compose of l = 0, 1 and 2 states, while
the population of a free rotor is composed of l = 0, 2, 4
states. The underlying physics comes from the reason

Let us now turn our attention to the case of orientation.
After applying a short pulse laser, the orientation hcos θi
of a hindered molecule (α = 60◦) oscillates sinusoidally
with time as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The value of hcos θi
is always positive because the rotational wavefunction is
compressed heavily. As the hindered angle α becomes
larger, the oscillation frequency also decreases as shown
in Fig. 3 (b). These signatures are quite close to that
of the alignment. We then conclude that even at larger
hindered angle (α = 1200) the role of hindered potential
still overwhelms the laser pulse, or the value of hcos θi
should not always be positive.

Fig. 3 (c) represents results of orientations in inﬁnite
(V0 = ∞) or ﬁnite (V0 = 100) conical-well potential for
α = 1750. Dashed and dotted lines correspond to V0 = ∞
and 100, respectively. As can be seen, the eﬀect of laser
pulse is obvious because negative value appears. Com-

FIG. 3: The orientations hcos θi (solid lines) of a hindered
molecule conﬁned by inﬁnite conical-well for diﬀerent hin-
dered angles: (a) α = 600, (b) α = 1200, (c) α = 1750.
The dashed and dotted lines in (c) correspond to diﬀerent
potential barrier height, i.e. V0 = ∞ and 100, respectively.

paring the results with the free orientation [7], the an-
gular distributions for ﬁnite well are more isotropic since
the wave functions can penetrate into the conical-barrier.

cos2 θ

Further analysis shows that components of orientation
hcos θi or alignment
can be divided into two
parts: diagonal and nondiagonal terms. The nondiag-
(cid:11)
onal term represents the variations of these curves such
as those in the insets of Fig. 2. These variations with
time are determined by the phase diﬀerence coming from
various energy levels. To see the contributions from di-
agonal terms, we evaluate the time-averaged orientation
and alignment. In this case, the nondiagonal values will
be averaged out, and only contributions from diagonal
terms exit. Fig. 4 shows the mean orientation and align-
ment as a function of hindered angle. As α increases,
the mean orientation decreases monotonically from 1 to
0. This is because the mean orientation is determined
by |clm|2 and hψlm |cos θ| ψlmi. For a larger angle α, the
populations |clm|2 mainly compose of l = 0, 2, 4 states.
But the value hψlm |cos θ| ψlmi is governed by the selec-
tion rule: l = l′ + 1. Thus the net eﬀect is the shrinking
of the mean orientation in large angle limit.

Contrary to orientation, the mean alignment shows a
quite diﬀerent feature. The value of
ﬁrst de-
creases as α increases. However, it reaches a minimum

In conclusion, we have shown that a short laser pulse
can induce alignment and orientation of a hindered
molecule. The hindered angle of hindered potential well
plays a key role on the molecular alignment and orienta-
tion. Crossover from ﬁeld-free rotation to hindered one
can be observed by varying the hindered angle of the po-
tential well. Time averaged alignment and orientation
are investigated thoroughly to understand the diﬀerence
between these two quantities.

Abstract. We consider electron impact single ionization of an atom at large energy-
momentum transfer in the nearly Bethe-ridge kinematics. For evaluation of the
ionization amplitude, a plane wave Born series is employed. A regularization procedure
is utilized in circumventing typical divergence problems associated with the higher-
order Born terms. The regularized Born series for the ionization amplitude is
derived. On this basis, renormalized analogs of the traditional plane wave Born
and impulse approximations are developed. These renormalized ﬁrst-order models
resemble the traditional plane wave impulse approximation with a modiﬁed Gamow
factor. Numerical results using diﬀerent approximations are presented and analyzed
for the case of electron-hydrogen ionization. The present theoretical consideration can
be important for absolute measurements.

Electron-atom ionization near the Bethe ridge

1. Introduction

Single ionization by electron impact (or (e,2e) collision) at large energy-momentum
transfer in the nearly Bethe-ridge kinematics, where the recoil
ion momentum is
small compared with the transferred one, constitutes a powerful spectroscopic tool for
exploring electronic structure of atomic systems [1, 2, 3, 4]. This (e,2e) method is often
referred to as the Electron Momentum Spectroscopy (EMS) [1, 2]. Theoretical grounds
of the EMS exploit domination of the lowest-order term, such as given by the plane
wave Born or impulse approximation (PWBA or PWIA), when treating the ionization
amplitude perturbatively and using plane waves for description of the incident and
outgoing electron states. Formally, the ratio of the higher-order and lowest-order Born
−1/2
terms behaves as ∝ E
, where E0 is the incident electron energy, and hence one might
0
expect the lowest-order term to prevail at high values of E0. However, on the energy
shell the plane wave higher-order terms are given by divergent integrals [5], which are
due to so-called Coulomb singularities of the transition operator [6, 7, 8]. Therefore,
for drawing conclusions on the validity of the PWBA model, one should cope with the
problem of divergences of the corresponding perturbation series.

The Born series follows from the Lippmann-Schwinger equation which has a
noncompact kernel. However, in the case of short-range potentials, the noncompactness
of the kernel does not prevent from calculating matrix elements of the Born series.
For the purpose of a mathematically correct formulation, Faddeev proposed to
reduce the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to a system of three coupled equations with
compact kernels [9, 10]. This system leads to the Born-Faddeev series where two-
particle amplitudes depending on three arguments (the relative-motion energy and
incoming/outgoing momenta) appear instead of the corresponding potentials. The
higher-order Born-Faddeev terms contain the two-particle amplitudes which in general
are oﬀ-shell, i.e. their arguments do not necessarily obey the energy-momentum relations
for free particles. The lowest-order Born-Faddeev term, given by a half-on-shell two-
particle amplitude, yields the usual PWIA.

In the case of Coulomb potentials Faddeev’s reduction does not oﬀer mathematical
advantages, since the kernel remains noncompact [6, 10]. This is a consequence of the
fact that the plane wave states do not obey the correct asymptotic behavior for the
Coulomb breakup. Thus, the resultant Born-Faddeev series contains divergent terms
and, like the PWBA case, the validity of the PWIA model is questionable. At the
same time, plane waves are usually a convenient and handy mathematical tool for
calculating the Born and Born-Faddeev series. And as far as the corresponding higher-
order terms diverge on the energy shell, one must resort to a regularization procedure
which removes the artiﬁcial, unphysical problem of divergences. Further, one must ﬁnd a
relation between the regularized perturbation series and the exact ionization amplitude.
Only then, a perturbative treatment of the ionization amplitude can be developed in a
physically consistent manner.

The objective of this work is to revise the traditional PWBA and PWIA models

Electron-atom ionization near the Bethe ridge

in the light of the fact that these ﬁrst-order theories ignore the divergence problem
associated with the higher-order contributions to the ionization amplitude. The
present theoretical analysis is based on the results of [5], where a practical recipe for
regularization of the plane wave Born series was proposed, and those of Shablov et
al [7, 8, 10], who established a relation between the exact ionization amplitude and
the unphysical plane wave Lippmann-Schwinger one in the on-shell limit. We proceed
from the Born series, since, as mentioned above, Faddeev’s reduction is not of beneﬁt in
the case of Coulomb potentials and hence may lead to methodological confusion. After
regularizing the Born series, one can formulate renormalized analogs of the traditional
PWBA and PWIA models. These analogs resemble the traditional PWIA model with
a modiﬁed Gamow factor. As shown below, the modiﬁed Gamow factor depends on the
choice of a regularization procedure and therefore it is not uniquely determined. This
feature permits, in principle, to choose such version of the Gamow factor that eﬃciently
incorporates higher-order eﬀects ignored by the traditional ﬁrst-order models. The above
points are addressed in the consideration that follows and are illustrated with numerical
results.

Section 2 of this paper delivers a general formulation for the (e,2e) reaction on an
atom.
In section 3, speciﬁc Born approximations are formulated using a regularized
Born series. Section 4 is devoted to the impulse approximation theory in the context
of the regularization formalism. The numerical results for the case of electron-hydrogen
ionization are presented and discussed in section 5 and the conclusions are drawn in
section 6. The atomic units (au) e = ~ = me = 1 are used throughout unless otherwise
stated.

2. General formulation

We specify the momenta of the incident, scattered and ejected electrons by k0, ks and
ke, respectively. The corresponding energies are denoted by E0, Es and Ee. The initial
atomic and the ﬁnal ionic states are speciﬁed by their respective wavefunctions ΦZ
i ,
ΦZ−1
, where Z designates the nuclear charge, and energies εi, εf . The rate of the (e,2e)

reaction is characterized by the triple diﬀerential cross section (TDCS)

Here the directions of the outgoing electron momenta are speciﬁed by the solid angles
Ωs and Ωe. The amplitude Ts (Te) corresponds to the situation where the scattered
electron has the momentum ks (ke). The so-called capture amplitude is ignored,
since we consider such kinematical regimes where the capture of the incident electron
accompanied with ejection of two atomic electrons having the momenta ks and ke is
negligible.
In equation (1) a sum (average) over unresolved ionic (atomic) states is
assumed.

The amplitude is given by (below we focus on the amplitude Ts omitting its index)

incident electron, satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation

and obeys the proper Coulomb asymptotics, whose speciﬁcity is due to a long-range
character of the interactions between the ﬁnal-state fragments.

the physical quantities that have been introduced in the preceding subsection (such
as the amplitude T and the total scattering state |Ψ−

(7)
All other (higher-order) Born terms ˜T (n) and the sum of these terms are divergent
(see [5] and Appendix A for details). These observations are not novel and are due to
a well-known fact that the plane wave states do not obey the asymptotic conditions
peculiar to break-up Coulomb scattering. Thus, equation (6) gives an unphysical result
and hence it can not be employed for a perturbative treatment of the correct, physical
amplitude (2). In addition, the validity of the traditional PWBA model (7) can not be
based upon equation (6).

2.2. The oﬀ-shell Born series

The situation changes if we consider the Born series (6) oﬀ the energy shell, i.e. when
E 6= Es + Ee + εf . Setting E − Es − Ee − εf = ∆ > 0, we have

˜T (∆) =

˜T (n)(∆) ≡ T PWBA +

( ˜T (n)(0) ≡ ˜T (n)),

Xn=1

where all the higher-order Born terms are ﬁnite [5] (see also Appendix A). If the value of
the oﬀ-shell parameter ∆ approaches the on-shell case ∆ = 0, the Born series (8) exhibits
a typical Coulomb singularity ˜T (∆) ∝ ∆−iη [6, 8, 10], where η is a total Sommerfeld
parameter:

η = ηs + ηe + ηse

(ηs = −k−1

s , ηe = −k−1

e , and ηse = |ks − ke|−1).

The physical amplitude (2) is derived from (8) in the following manner [7, 8, 10]:

(9)

where

is the Dollard phase [11]. Note that in the on-shell limit ∆ → 0 the divergent factor ∆iη
compensates for the singularity of ˜T (∆). In the next section we show how the calculation
scheme based on equation (9) can be implemented in practice through regularization of
the Born series.

3. Born approximations

For taking the on-shell limit ∆ → 0 in equation (9), it is convenient to have ∆−iη factored
out in the oﬀ-shell Born series (8). This can be fulﬁlled by means of a regularization
procedure (see Appendix B). As a result, we obtain the amplitude (9) in the factorized
form

where ˜T (n)

R is the regularized on-shell Born term and R is a regularization function†,

In contrast to (6), the result (10) allows to develop a perturbative treatment of
the physical amplitude. However, when truncating the regularized on-shell Born series
˜TR to a ﬁnite number of terms, there is an uncertainty associated with the choice of a
regularization procedure. Namely, while

that depends on the choice of a regularization procedure/function. These observations
are reminiscent of the situation that one encounters in quantum electrodynamics,
when regularizing a series of Feynman’s diagrams. Drawing an analogy with that
situation, one can speak of a renormalization group which is formed by the regularization
procedures in the present case. Therefore we will refer to equation (11) as a renormalized
PWBA (RPWBA).

In this work we develop the Born series for the physical amplitude (2) in a manner

similar to equation (6), that is

can be deduced from (10) that

4.1. The usual theory

Near the Bethe ridge the (e,2e) process can be modelled as a binary encounter between
the projectile electron and the electron that is ejected from the atom [1]. The
PWIA theory formulates this picture mathematically. Within the Lippmann-Schwinger
approach (6) it is expressed as follows:

˜T PWIA =

where ˜T (n)

Xn=0

As in the case of (6), the n ≥ 1 terms and the sum of these terms are divergent. We
can remedy this defect in order to obtain a correct, convergent counterpart of (17).
For this purpose we use the result (10), assuming that Vi = V = Vse and, accordingly,
ηs = ηe = 0. Thus one derives the physical counterpart of (17) as

T PWIA = Rse˜tRFif (q) = τ Fif (q)

(Rse = R|ηs=ηe=0),

(18)

where q = ks +ke −k0 is opposite to the recoil ion momentum and Fif (q) = hΦZ
qi
is the so-called structure amplitude [1]. ˜tR is the regularized Lippmann-Schwinger half-
on-shell amplitude for ee-scattering [5] and τ is the exact half-on-shell ee-scattering
amplitude [12, 13]:

f

i |ΦZ−1

τ = τ {k0 − 1

2 (ks + ke), 1

2(ks − ke); [ 1

2(ks − ke)]2}.

The result (18) is irrespective of the choice of a regularization procedure, since Rse˜tR =
R′
˜tR′. Note that equation (18) is a corner-stone of the usual PWIA theory of (e,2e)
se
reactions on atoms [1, 2].

4.2. A renormalized theory

While there is nothing wrong in the above derivation of the traditional PWIA result, it
can be noticed that at the starting point (17) we have focused on the purely electron-
electron part of (6) and thereby we have ignored the remaining part which is also
divergent. Methodologically, one should apply the binary-encounter approximation to
the regularized Lippmann-Schwinger amplitude ˜TR (see (10)) which, in contrast to (6),
is free of divergences. The electron-electron component of ˜TR is given by the regularized
Lippmann-Schwinger amplitude ˜tR for ee-scattering (see (18)). Using (10) and (18), the
PWIA to the physical amplitude T is then given by

T PWIA
R

= R˜tRFif (q) = (R/Rse)τ Fif (q).

(19)

Electron-atom ionization near the Bethe ridge

8

Since in general R/Rse 6= R′/R′
se, the PWIA amplitude (19) is determined by the choice
of a regularization procedure. In particular, the speciﬁc case R/Rse = 1 amounts to the
traditional PWIA (18). As far as the choice of a regularization procedure is a matter of
taste, equation (19) oﬀers an inﬁnite number of alternatives. This fact has the following
general consequence: there is no a priori PWIA model in the case of (e,2e) reactions on
atoms. By analogy with the RPWBA case (11), the approximation (19) will be referred
to as a renormalized PWIA (RPWIA).

Within the traditional PWIA model (18) the TDCS (1) is expressed as [1]

As can be deduced, the RPWIA result (23) diﬀers from the traditional PWIA
one (20) only in the expression for the Gamow factor. In contrast to (21), the modiﬁed
Gamow factor (24) treats the ﬁnal-state particle pairs on equal footing. It should be
noted that the same result as (24) is obtained using the ﬁrst-order model introduced
by Shablov et al
[7] on the basis of the formalism of regularization Coulomb operators,
and it can be traced down to the idea of eﬀective charges proposed by Peterkop [15].
The inﬂuences of the traditional and modiﬁed Gamow factors on TDCS are examined
in the next section, where we present the corresponding numerical results.

5. Numerical realization

In this section we present numerical results for an archetypical case, namely the (e,2e)
reaction on a hydrogen atom. The symmetric setup Es = Ee and θs = θe = 45◦ is
inspected, where the polar electron angles θs and θe are measured with respect to the
direction of the incident electron momentum.
In the considered setup the TDCS is
usually studied as a function of q = |q| (see (17)) whose value is varied in noncoplanar
geometry by varying the value of the relative azimuthal angle ∆φse = φs − φe, where φs
(φe) is the azimuthal angle of the scattered (ejected) electron. The minimal value of q
corresponds then to the symmetric coplanar case (|∆φse| = π), where the incident and
outgoing electron momenta are in the same plane.

We focus on high energy values (Es = Ee & 1 keV) which closely meet
In the absence of the corresponding
the Bethe-ridge and binary-encounter criteria.
EMS measurements, particularly those performed on an absolute scale, the results
of the traditional and renormalized ﬁrst-order treatments are compared with those
of the PWB2 calculations and those of the Brauner-Briggs-Klar (BBK) model [16], a
representative of nonperturbative treatments. The PWB2 calculations have been carried
out in accordance with (16), where the on-shell limit has been taken analytically using
the regularization procedure described in Appendix B. The regularized PWB2 integrals
have been performed numerically following the method developed in [17].

In the BBK model the ﬁnal state in (2) is given by

BBK(ks, ke)i = |ϕ−(ks)i ⊗ |ϕ−(ke)i ⊗ |χ−(kse)i

|Ψ−
(27)
where |ϕ−(ks)i and |ϕ−(ke)i are the Coulomb waves describing outgoing electrons
moving in the ﬁeld of the proton. The electron-electron correlation factor |χ−(kse)i
is determined through

2 (ks − ke)),

(kse = 1

|ksi ⊗ |kei ⊗ |χ−(kse)i = |ψ−(ks, ke)i,

where |ψ−(ks, ke)i is the exact scattering state in the absence of the electron-proton
interactions. The wave function (27) has the correct asymptotic behavior and gives

Electron-atom ionization near the Bethe ridge

correct results in the limiting situations, where (i) the charge of one of the ﬁnal-state
particles is switched oﬀ and (ii) the electron-electron interaction is absent. Note that
the BBK model yields the regularization function (B.7) as

RBBK = exp(− 1

2 πη)Γ(1 − iηs)Γ(1 − iηe)Γ(1 − iηse).

The corresponding Gamow factor is then given by

GBBK = G(ηs)G(ηe)G(ηse) =

2πηs
e2πηs − 1

2πηe
e2πηe − 1

2πηse
e2πηse − 1

.

Like (24), this Gamow factor also treats the ﬁnal-state particle pairs on equal footing.
The numerical calculations using the traditional PWBA and PWIA models
have been performed in accordance with equations (26) and (20), respectively. As
remarked in subsection 4.3, in the case of symmetric kinematics the RPWBA (25) and
RPWIA (23) models are equivalent and therefore below the corresponding numerical
results referred to as RPWBA/RPWIA. For a hydrogen target, the structure factor
entering equations (20), (23), (25), and (26) is

5.1. Numerical results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the numerical results for the symmetric noncoplanar kinematics
utilized in the recent (e,2e) measurements on helium [3].
It can be seen that the
RPWBA/RPWIA results are substantially larger in magnitude than the PWIA ones,
which are the smallest in magnitude. This feature indicates an appreciable role of
the choice of the Gamow factor in the kinematics under consideration. Interestingly,
the PWBA and BBK results are close to each other both in magnitude and in shape.
Though the BBK model is not exact, it takes into account those higher-order eﬀects
that are entirely neglected by the PWBA treatment. One might thus conclude that the
higher-order contributions to the TDCS are subsidiary in the present case. However,
this conclusion needs experimental veriﬁcation, since marked discrepancies between the

PWBA and PWB2 results are observed in ﬁgure 1.
developed renormalized ﬁrst-order theories give an opportunity to ﬁt the exact TDCS
by the proper choice of the Gamow factor. For example, setting (cf equation (24))

G(η) = 1

in equations (23) and (25), one obtains the traditional PWBA result and thus, as can
be seen in ﬁgure 1, rather well reproduces the BBK results for the present kinematics.
And the PWB2 results are satisfactorily reproduced in magnitude using the modiﬁed
Gamow factor (24).

practically identical shapes for the TDCS. This feature is due to the almost constancy
of the Sommerfeld parameters ηse and η, and hence of the Gamow factors (21) and (24),
in the involved kinematical region. It should be noted that the value of the Gamow
factor (29) is nearly the same as that of (24). This observation can be explained by
the feature that the ﬁrst-order expansions of (24) and (29) with respect to ηs, ηe, and
ηse are identical. Another important observation is that, in contrast to the traditional
Gamow factor (21), the modiﬁed Gamow factor (24) enhances the magnitude of the
TDCS with respect to that in the conventional PWBA case. At the same time, all
three ﬁrst-order models are practically equivalent for description of the corresponding
symmetric noncoplanar measurements provided that the latter are performed on a
relative scale (see, for instance, [18]). This conclusion follows from the fact that in the
case of the inspected ﬁrst-order models the shape of the TDCS (the so-called momentum
proﬁle [1, 3, 4]) is almost fully determined by the structure factor (30).

The eﬀect of the Gamow factor on the magnitude of TDCS in the considered
geometry is shown in ﬁgure 3. As can be deduced from the ﬁgure, the RPWBA/RPWIA
and the traditional PWIA values for the TDCS rather slowly converge to each other
and ultimately to the traditional PWBA value upon the increase of the incident electron
energy E0. For E0 ∼ 10 keV, the RPWBA/RPWIA results are larger in magnitude than
the traditional PWIA ones by a factor of ∼ 1.5, and even in the region E0 ∼ 100 keV,

where one might expect relativistic eﬀects to come on the scene, the relative diﬀerence
between the results in magnitude is about 10%. These ﬁndings are in discord with an
intuitive physical picture which assumes practical equivalence of the ﬁrst-order models
in the kinematics that approaches the classical ridge of a billiard-ball collision [2]. The
discrepancy can be explained by the following factors: (i) the long-range Coulomb forces
between the colliding electrons, as opposed to the contact-like forces between classical
billiard balls, and (ii) the presence of the Coulomb ﬁeld of the ion (this factor is relevant
only to the RPWBA/RPWIA model).

6. Summary and conclusions

In summary, we have considered the electron-atom ionization process at large energy-
momentum transfer and near the Bethe ridge. Proceeding from the plane wave
Lippmann-Schwinger amplitude, which diverges on the energy shell, we have regularized
the corresponding Born series. On this basis we have developed the correct, physical
Born treatment whose lowest-order term amounts to the conventional PWBA. The
RPWBA model has been formulated, which depends on the employed regularization
procedure. We have shown that the PWIA can not be uniquely determined and therefore
in which the Gamow factor is determined
we have introduced the RPWIA model,
by the choice of a regularization procedure. The numerical results for the symmetric

noncoplanar kinematics have been presented. It has been demonstrated that even at
high electron energies (∼ 10 keV) the magnitude of the TDCS is very sensitive to the
choice of the Gamow factor.

We might expect the results of this work to be primarily important for theoretical
treatments of absolute (e,2e) measurements in the nearly Bethe-ridge kinematics at large
energy-momentum transfer and for further development of the EMS method [1]. The
present theoretical consideration can be generalized to the case of ionization of an atom
by a charged-particle impact, for example, to the cases of positron- and proton-atom
ionization. Using the formulated RPWBA and RPWIA models with a properly modiﬁed
Gamow factor, one can eﬃciently take into account the higher-order eﬀects ignored
by the traditional PWBA and PWIA models. In this connection, it should be noted
that a consistent, rigorous treatment of the higher-order contributions to the ionization
amplitude is realized by means of the developed plane wave Born series (12), which
has an apparent advantageous feature: the value of any of its terms is, by deﬁnition,
irrespective of the choice of a regularization procedure.

Appendix A. Divergencies of the Born series

It can be seen that the integrand has a pronounced singularity at the point p = 0 which
physically corresponds to elastic rescattering in the forward direction. This feature
makes the integral (A.1) divergent. The same argument applies to the electron-ion
parts of the n = 1 term, since for the static matrix elements of Vs and Ve we have:

Below we describe a possible recipe for factoring out ∆−iη in equation (8) and then taking
the on-shell limit in equation (9). It consists in presenting the Green’s operator (4) in

It means that while the product
R ˜TR = T (B.6) is an algoristic quantity, the factors R and ˜TR are not, i.e. R ˜TR = R ˜TR,
where R (R = 1 if ˜η = 0) and ˜TR corresponds to an alternative regularization procedure.
For example, there is such regularization procedure that yields R = 1 for any value of
˜η. To illustrate this statement, we expand R in the Taylor series with respect to the
components of ˜η and notice that ˜T (n)
R ∝ ˜ηn. We have

Abstract

Starting from a solution of the problem of a mechanical oscillator coupled to a scalar ﬁeld inside

a reﬂecting sphere of radius R, we study the behaviour of the system in free space as the limit of

an arbitrarily large radius in the conﬁned solution. From a mathematical point of view we show

that this way of facing the problem is not equivalent to consider the system a priori embedded

in inﬁnite space. In particular, the matrix elements of the transformation turning the system to

principal axis, do not tend to distributions in the limit of an arbitrarily large sphere as it should

be the case if the two procedures were mathematically equivalent. Also, we introduce ”dressed”

coordinates which allow an exact description of the oscillator radiation process for any value of

the coupling, strong or weak. In the case of weak coupling, we recover from our exact expressions

the well known decay formulas from perturbation theory.

1 Introduction

Since a long time ago the experimental and theoretical investigations on the polarization of atoms

by optical pumping and the possibility of detecting changes in their polarization states has al-

lowed the observation of resonant eﬀects associated to the coupling of these atoms with strong

radiofrequency ﬁelds [1]. As remarked in [2], the theoretical understanding of these eﬀects using

perturbative methods requires the calculation of very high-order terms in perturbation theory,

what makes the standard Feynman diagrams technique practically unreliable in those cases. The

trials of treating non-perturbativelly such kind of systems consisting of an atom coupled to the

electromagnetic ﬁeld, have lead to the idea of ”dressed atom”, introduced in refs [3] and [4]. This

approach consists in quantizing the electromagnetic ﬁeld and analyzing the whole system consist-

ing of the atom coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Along the years since then, this concept

has been extensively used to investigate several situations involving the interaction of atoms and

electromagnetic ﬁelds. For instance, atoms embedded in a strong radiofrequency ﬁeld background

in refs. [5] and [6], atoms in intense resonant laser beans in ref. [7] or the study of photon correla-

tions and quantum jumps. In this last situation, as showed in refs. [8], [9] and [10], the statistical

properties of the random sequence of outcoming pulses can be analyzed by a broadband photode-

tector and the dressed atom approach provides a convenient theoretical framework to perform this

analysis.

Besides the idea of dressed atom in itself, another aspect that desserves attention is the non-

linear character of the problem involved in realistic situations, which implies, as noted above, in

2

very hard mathematical problems to be dealt with. An way to circunvect these mathematical

diﬃculties, is to assume that under certain conditions the coupled atom-electromagnetic ﬁeld

system may be approximated by the system composed of an harmonic oscillator coupled linearly

to the ﬁeld trough some eﬀective coupling constant g.

In this sense,

in a slightly diﬀerent context, recently a signiﬁcative number of works has

been spared to the study of cavity QED, in particular to the theoretical investigation of higher-

generation Schrodinger cat-states in high-Q cavities, as has been done for instance in [11]. Linear

approximations of this type have been applied along the last years in quantum optics to study

decoherence, by assuming a linear coupling between a cavity harmonic mode and a thermal bath

of oscillators at zero temperature, as it has been done in [12] and [13]. To investigate decoherence

of higher generation Schrodinger cat-states the cavity ﬁeld reduced matrix for these states could

be calculated either by evaluating the normal-ordering characteristic function, or by solving the

evolution equation for the ﬁeld-resevoir state using the normal mode expansion, generalizing the

analysis of [12] and [13].

In this paper we adopt a general physicist’s point of view, we do not intend to describe the

speciﬁc features of a particular physical situation, instead we analyse a simpliﬁed linear version

of the atom-ﬁeld system and we try to extract the more detailed information we can from this

model. We take a linear simpliﬁed model in order to try to have a clearer understanding of what

we believe is one of the essential points, namely, the need of non-perturbative analytical treatments

to coupled systems, which is the basic problem underlying the idea of dressed atom. Of course,

3

such an approach to a realistic non-linear system is an extremelly hard task and here we make

what we think is a good agreement between physical reality and mathematical reliability, with the

hope that in future work our approach could be transposed to more realistic situations.

We consider a non relativistic system composed of a harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to

a scalar ﬁeld in ordinary Euclidean 3-dimensional space. We start from an analysis of the same

system conﬁned in a reﬂecting sphere of radius R, and we assume that the free space solution to

the radiating oscillator should be obtained taking a radius arbitrarily large in the R-dependent

quantities. The limit of an arbitrarily large radius in the mathematics of the conﬁned system

is taken as a good description of the ordinary situation of the radiating oscillator in free space.

We will see that this is not equivalent to the alternative continuous formulation in terms of

distributions, which is the case when we consider a priori the system in unlimited space. The

limiting procedure adopted here allows to avoid the inherent ambiguities present in the continuous

formulation. From a physical point of view we give a non-perturbative treatment to the oscillator

radiation introducing some coordinates that allow to divide the coupled system into two parts, the

”dressed” oscillator and the ﬁeld, what makes unecessary to work directly with the concepts of

”bare” oscillator, ﬁeld and interaction to study the radiation process. These are the main reasons

why we study a simpliﬁed linear system instead of a more realistic model, to make evident some

subtleties of the mathematics involved in the limiting process of taking a cavity arbitrarily large,

and also to exhibit an exact solution valid for weak as well as for strong coupling. These aspects

would be masked in the perturbative approach used to study non-linear couplings.

We start considering a harmonic oscillator q0(t) of frequency ω0 coupled linearly to a scalar

ﬁeld φ(r, t), the whole system being conﬁned in a sphere of radius R centered at the oscillator

position. The equations of motion are,

between two neighbouring ﬁeld frequencies, ωi+1 − ωi = ∆ω = πc/R.

quencies spectrum

2.1 - Coupled harmonic Oscillators

Let us consider for a moment the problem of a harmonic oscillator q0 coupled to N other

oscillators. In the limit N → ∞ we recover our original situation of the coupling oscillator-ﬁeld

5

after redeﬁnition of divergent quantities, in a manner analogous as renormalization is done in ﬁeld

theories. In terms of the cutoﬀ N the coupled equations (3) and (4) are simply rewritten taking

the upper limit N instead of ∞ for the summation in the right hand side of Eq.(3) and the system
of N + 1 coupled oscillators q0 {qi} corresponds to the Hamiltonian,

There are N + 1 solutions Ωr to Eq.(10), corresponding to the N + 1 normal collective oscillation

right hand term. After some manipulations we obtain

It is easily seen that if ω2

0 > Nη2 Eq.(11) yelds only positive solutions for Ω2, what means that the

system oscillates harmonically in all its modes. Indeed, in this case the left hand term of Eq.(11)

is positive for negative values of Ω2. Conversely the right hand term is negative for those values

of Ω2. Thus there is no negative solution of that equation when ω2

0 > Nη2. On the other hand it

can be shown that if ω2

0 < Nη2, Eq.(11) has a single negative solution Ω2

−. In order to prove it let

us deﬁne the function

I(Ω2) = (ω2

It can be noticed that I(Ω2) → ∞ as

(12)

Accordingly Eq.(11) can be rewritten as I(Ω2) = 0.

Ω2 → −∞ and

I(Ω2 = 0) = ω2

0 − Nη2 < 0

(13)

Furthermore I(Ω2) is a monotonically decreasing function in that interval. Consequently I(Ω2) = 0

has a single negative solution when ω2

0 < Nη2 as we have pointed out. This means that there

is an oscillation mode whose amplitude varies exponentially and that does not allows stationary

7

conﬁgurations. We will not care about this last situation. Thus we assume ω2

0 > Nη2 and deﬁne

the renormalized oscillator frequency ¯ω [14],

In terms of the renormalized frequency Eq.(10) becomes,

From Eqs. (8), (9) and (15), a straightforward calculation shows the orthonormality relations for

the transformation matrix (tr

We get the transformation matrix elements for the oscillator-ﬁeld system by taking the limit

N → ∞ in the above equations. Recalling the deﬁnition of η from Eqs. (3) and (4), we obtain
after some algebraic manipulations, from Eqs. (15), (8) and (9), the matrix elements in the limit

Let us now return to the coupling oscillator-ﬁeld by taking the limit N → ∞ in the relations of
the preceeding subsection. In this limit it becomes clear the need for the frequency renormalization

in Eq.(14). It is exactly the analogous of a mass renormalization in ﬁeld theory, the inﬁnite ω0 is

8

chosen in such a way as to make the renormalized frequency ¯ω ﬁnite. Remembering Eq.(15) the

solutions with respect to the variable Ω of the equation

k − Ω2 ,
give the collective modes frequencies. We remember ωk = k πc

The secant curve corresponding to the right hand side of the above equation cuts only once each

0 < ǫr < 1, r = 0, 1, 2..., and the collective eigenfrequencies are,

The ﬁeld φ(r, t) can be expressed in terms of the normal modes. We start from its expansion

(29)

3 The limit R → ∞ - mathematical aspects

3.1 - Discussion of the mathematical problem

Unless explicitly stated, in the remaining of this paper the symbol R → ∞ is to be understood
as the situation of a cavity of ﬁxed, arbitrarily large radius. In order to compare the behaviour

of the system in a very large cavity to that it would be in free space, let us ﬁrstly consider the

system embedded in an a priori inﬁnite Euclidean space; in this case to compute the quantities

describing the system means essentially to replace by integrals the discrete sums appearing in the

conﬁned problem, taking direcltly R = ∞. An alternative procedure is to compute the quantities
describing the system conﬁned in a sphere of radius R and take the limit R → ∞ afterwards. This
last approach to describe the system in free space should keep in some way the ”memory” of the

conﬁned system. To be physically equivalent one should expect that the two approachs give the

same results. We will see that at least from a mathematical point of view this is not exactly the

case. We remark that a solution to the problem of a system composed of an oscillator coupled to

a ﬁeld in free space, is already known since a long time ago [15] in the context of Bownian motion.

This solution is quite diﬀerent from ours, in the sense that it not concerns the system conﬁned to

11

a box and also that it is limited to the dipole term from the multipolar expansion to the ﬁeld.

In the continuous formalism of free space the ﬁeld normal modes Fourier components (analogous

to the components φs in Eq.(26)) are,

where

and where the we have taken the appropriate continuous form of Eqs.(16) and (17). Splitting

ω/(ω2 − Ω2) into partial fractions we get

φΩ = h(Ω)Z +∞

(34)

The pole at ω = Ω prevents the existence of the integral in Eq.(34). The usual way to

circumvect this diﬃculty is to replace the integral by one of the quantities,

Limǫ→0Z +∞

P (

) ± iδ(ω − Ω),

(35)

(36)

with P standing for principal value. In our case this redeﬁnition of the normal modes Fourier

components may be justiﬁed by the fact that both integrals in Eq.(35) are solutions of the equations

of motion (1) and (2) for r 6= 0, and so the solution should be a linear combination of them. The

12

situation is diﬀerent if we adopt the point of view of taking the limit R → ∞ in the solution of the
conﬁned problem. In this case the Fourier component φΩ is obtained by taking the limit R → ∞
in the expression for the ﬁeld, Eq(28), what allows to obtain an uniquely deﬁned expression to the

normal modes Fourier components, to each φΩ corresponding a phase δΩ (the limit R → ∞ of δs
in Eq.(22) given by

cotδΩ =

1
πg

Ω2 − ¯ω2

Ω

.

(37)

Also, comparing Eqs.(35), (36) and (26) we see that the adoption of the continuous formalism is

equivalent to assume that in the limit R → ∞ the elements ts
be replaced by δ+(ω − Ω) or by δ−(ω − Ω). This procedure is, from a mathematical point of view,
perfectly justiﬁed but at the price of loosing uniqueness in the deﬁnition of the ﬁeld components.

i of the transformation matrix should

If we take the solution of the conﬁned problem and we compute the matrix elements ts

i for R

arbitrarily large, we will see in subsection 3.2 that these elements do not tend to distributions in

this limit. As R becomes larger and larger the set of non-vanishing elements ts

i concentrate for

each i in a small neighbourhood of ωi. In the limit R → ∞ the whole set of the matrix elements
ts
i contains an arbitrarily large number of elements quadratically summables [16]. For the matrix

elements ts

0 we obtain a quadratically integrable expression.

In the continuous formulation the unit matrix, corresponding to the absence of coupling, has

elements EΩ

ω = δ(ω− Ω), while if we start from the conﬁned situation, it can be veriﬁed that in the

The basic quantity describing the system, the transformation matrix T = (ts

will see, diﬀerent properties in free space, if we use the continuous formalism or if we adopt the

procedure of taking the limit R → ∞ from the matrix elements in the conﬁned problem .
the ﬁrst case we must deﬁne the matrix elements tΩ

ω linking free ﬁeld modes to normal modes,

In

as distributions. On the other side adopting the second procedure we will ﬁnd that the limiting

matrix elements LimR→∞ ts

i are not distributions, but well deﬁned ﬁnite quantities. The two

procedures are not equivalent, the limit R → ∞ does not commute with other operations. In this
note we take as physically meaningfull the second procedure, we solve ﬁrst the problem in the

conﬁned case (ﬁnite R) and take afterwards the limit of inﬁnite (in the sense of arbitrarily large)

radius of the cavity. In the next subsection we perform a detailed analysis of the limit R → ∞ of
the transformation matrix (tr

µ).

14

let us consider R large enough such that we may take ∆ω ≈ ∆Ω and consider the points of the
spectrum of eigenfrequencies Ω inside and outside a neighbourhood η (deﬁned in Eqs.(3) and (4)

of ωi. We note that R > 2πc

i tend to zero (see

Eq.(39)). Secondly all frequencies Ωr inside the neighbourhood η of ωi are arbitrarily close to ωi,

being in arbitrarily large number. Only the matrix elements tr

i corresponding to these frequencies

Ωr inside the neighbourhood η of ωi are diﬀerent from zero. For these we make the change of

We see from the above expressions that in the limit R → ∞ the matrix (tr

µ) remains an

orthonormal matrix in the usual sense as for ﬁnite R. With the choice of the procedure of taking

16

the limit R → ∞ from the conﬁned solution, the matrix elements do not tend to distributions in
the free space limit as it would be the case using the continuous formalism. All non- vanishing

matrix elements tr

i are concentrated inside a neighbourhood η of ωi, their set is a quadratically

summable enumerable set. The elements (tr

0) tend to a quadratically integrable expression.

4 The Radiation Process

We start this section deﬁning some coordinates q′

0, q′

i associated to the ”dressed” mechanical

oscillator and to the ﬁeld. These coordinates will reveal themselves to be suitable to give an

appealling non-perturbative description of the oscillator-ﬁeld system. The general conditions that

such coordinates must satisfy, taking into account that the system is rigorously described by the

collective normal coordinates modes Qr, are the following:

- In reason of the linear character of our problem the coordinates q′

0, q′

i should be linear functions

of the collective coordinates Qr

- They should allow to construct ortogonal conﬁgurations corresponding to the separation of

the system into two parts, the dressed oscillator and the ﬁeld.

- The set of these conﬁgurations should contain the ground state, Γ0.

The last of the above conditions restricts the transformation between the coordinates q′

µ, µ =

0, i = 1, 2, ... and the collective ones Qr to those leaving invariant the quadratic form,

as the time goes on, as if transitions among them were being in progress, while the basic conﬁgu-

ration Γ0 represents a rigorous eigenstate of the system and does not change with time. The new

coordinates q′

µ describe dressed conﬁgurations of the oscillator and ﬁeld quanta.

To describe the radiation process, having as initial condition that only the mechanical oscillator,

q0 be excited, the usual procedure is to consider the interaction term in the Hamiltonian written

in terms of q0, qi as a perturbation, which induces transitions among the eigenstates of the free

Hamiltonian.

In this way it is possible to treat approximatelly the problem having as initial

condition that only the bare oscillator be excited. But as is well known this initial condition is

physically not consistent due to the divergence of the bare oscillator frequency if there is interaction

with the ﬁeld. The traditional way to circumvect this diﬃculty is by the renormalization procedure,

18

introducing perturbativelly order by order corrections to the oscillator frequency. Here we adopt

an alternative procedure, we do not make explicit use of the concepts of interacting bare oscillator

and ﬁeld, described by the coordinates q0 and {qi}, we introduce ”dressed” coordinates q′
{q′

3.2 that in the the limit R → ∞, for each i the only non-vanishing matrix elements tr
i are those
for which the corresponding eigenfrequencies Ωr are arbitrarily near the ﬁeld frequency ωi. We

obtain from Eqs. (38), (42) and (43),

R → ∞ its proper identity, while the mechanical oscillator is always accompanied by a cloud of
ﬁeld quanta. Therefore we identify the coordinate q′
0 as the coordinate describing the mechanical

20

oscillator dressed by its proper ﬁeld, being the whole system divided into dressed oscillator and

ﬁeld, without appeal to the concept of interaction between them, the interaction being absorbed

in the dressing cloud of the oscillator. In the next subsections we use the dressed coordinates to

describe the radiation process.

set of orthonormal functions, the functions (64) may be written as linear combinations of the

In the following we study the behaviour of the system with the initial condition that only the

dressed mechanical oscillator q′

0 be in the N-th excited state. We will study in detail the particular

cases N = 1 and N = 2, which will be enough to have a clear understanding of our approach.

- N = 1: Let us call Γµ

1 the conﬁguration in which only the dressed oscillator q′

µ is in the ﬁrst

excited level. The initial conﬁguration in which the dressed mechanical oscillator is in the ﬁrst

excited level is Γ0

1. We have from Eq.(67), (65) (69) and (55) the following expression for the time

evolution of the ﬁrst-level excited dressed oscillator q′
µ,

where the coeﬃcients f µν(t) are given by

That is, the initially excited dressed oscillator naturally distributes its energy among itself and

all others dressed oscillators, as time goes on. If the mechanical dressed oscillator is in its ﬁrst

excited state at t = 0, its decay rate may evaluated from its time evolution equation,

Γ0

1 = Xν

f 0ν(t)Γν

1(0).

(72)

In Eq.(72) the coeﬃcients f 0ν(t) have a simple interpretation: remembering Eqs.(62) and (63),

f 00(t) and f 0i(t) are respectivelly the probability amplitudes that at time t the dressed mechanical

oscillator still be excited or have radiated a ﬁeld quantum of frequency ωi. We see that this for-

malism allows a quite natural description of the radiation process as a simple exact time evolution

of the system. Let us for instance evaluate the oscillator decay probability in this language. From

Eqs.(38) and (71) we get

f 00(t) = Z ∞

0

2gΩ2e−iΩt dΩ

(Ω2 − ω2)2 + π2g2Ω2 .

(73)

The above integral can be evaluated by Cauchy theorem. For large t (t >> 1

¯ω ), but arbitrary

coupling g, we obtain for the oscillator decay probability, the result,

|f 00(t)|2 = e−πgt(1 +

π2g2

4¯ω2 ) + e−πgt 8πg

π2 ¯ω8t6 ,

(74)

where ˜¯ω = q¯ω2 − π2g2

4 . In the above expression the approximation t >> 1

¯ω plays a role only in

the two last terms, due to the diﬃculties to evaluate exactly the integral in Eq. (73) along the

imaginary axis. The ﬁrst term comes from the residue at Ω = ˜¯ω + i πg

2 and would be the same if

we have done an exact calculation. If we consider the case of weak coupling, g << ¯ω, we obtain

23

the well known perturbative exponential decay law for the harmonic oscillator[18],

but we emphasize that Eq.(74) is valid for all values of the coupling constant g, even large, it is

|f 00(t)|2 ≈ e−πgt,

(75)

an expression valid for weak as well as strong couplings.

- N = 2

Let us call Γµν

11 the conﬁguration in which the dressed oscillators q′

µ and q′

ν are at their ﬁrst

excited level and Γµ

2 the conﬁguration in which q′

µ is at its second excited level. Taking as initial

condition that the dressed mechanical oscillator be at the second excited level, the time evolution

of the state Γ0

2 may be obtained in an analogous way as in the preceeding case,

Γ0

[f µµ(t)]2 Γµ

11 ,

(76)

where the coeﬃcients f µµ and f 0µ are given by (71). Then it easy to get the following probabilities:

Probability that the dressed oscillator still be excited at time t:

probability that the dressed oscillator have decayed at time t to the ﬁrst level by emission of a

P0(t) = |f 00(t)|4,

(77)

ﬁeld quantum:

P1(t) = 2|f 00(t)|2(1 − |f 00(t)|2)

and probability that the dressed oscillator have decayed at time t to the ground state:

P2(t) = 1 − 2|f 00(t)|2 + |f 00(t)|4.

24

(78)

(79)

Replacing Eq.(74) in the above expressions we get expressions for the probabilities decays valid

for any value of the coupling constant. In the particular case of weak coupling we obtain the well

known perturbative formulas for the oscillator decay [18],

and

P0(t) ≈ e−2πgt,

P1(t) ≈ 2e−πgt(1 − e−πgt)

P2(t) ≈ 1 − 2e−πgt + e−2πgt.

5 Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have analysed a sympliﬁed version of an atom-electromagnetic ﬁeld system and

we have tried to give the more exact and rigorous treatment we could to the problem. We have

adopted a general physicist’ s point of view, in the sense that we have rennounced to approach

very closely to the real behaviour of a complicated non-linear system, to study instead a simple

linear model. As a counterpart, an exact solution has been possible. Our dressed coordinates give

a description of the behaviour of the system that is exact and valid for weak as well as for strong

coupling. If the coupling between the mechanical oscillator and the ﬁeld is weak, we recover the

well known behaviour from perturbation theory.

This paper evolved from umpublished work we have done and discussions we have had, with Prof.

Guido Beck when two of us (A.P.C.M. and N.P.A.) were his students at Instituto de Fisica Balseiro

in Bariloche (Argentina), in the late sixties and the early seventies. We dedicate this article to his

memory.

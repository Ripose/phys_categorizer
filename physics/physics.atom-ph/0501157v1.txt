Vibrational excitation of diatomic molecular ions in strong-ﬁeld ionization of diatomic
molecules

A simple model is applied that qualitatively describes the distribution over vibrational states
formed in a diatomic molecular ion following ionization of the neutral molecule by intense laser
pulses. Good agreement is found with a recent experiment [X. Urbain et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,
163004 (2004)]. In particular, the observed deviation from a Franck-Condon-like distribution is now
understood. Additionally, we demonstrate control of the ﬁnal vibrational distribution by a simple
variation of the peak intensity or a change of frequency of the laser pulse.

PACS numbers: 33.80.Rv,33.80.Eh,82.50.Hp

Intense investigations during the last decades have led
to quite a detailed understanding of the interaction be-
tween strong laser ﬁelds and atoms (see [1] for a recent
review). This includes, e.g., the process of high-harmonic
generation which is by now a valuable source for the
production of coherent ultraviolet light. For molecules,
however, the extra degrees of freedom introduced by the
presence of more than one nucleus lead to a much more
involved picture, and the description of the strong-ﬁeld
driving of such systems far from equilibrium is still a chal-
lenge in theoretical physics (for recent reviews see [2, 3]).

The main topic of the present work is to investigate the
partitioning of energy among the electronic and nuclear
degrees of freedom when ionizing a diatomic molecule
by a strong laser ﬁeld. This is a topic of much current
interest: until recently it was assumed that the distri-
bution over vibrational states formed in the molecular
ion following ionization of the neutral molecule follows a
Franck-Condon (FC) distribution, and this assumption
is still frequently used (see [4] and references therein). A
recent experiment, however, reported a non-FC distribu-
tion and suggested that the use of the FC principle is
inaccurate because the rate for tunneling ionization in-
creases sharply with internuclear distance [4]. We will
show that the rapid response of the electron to the laser
ﬁeld in fact ensures the applicability of the FC principle
for the nuclear motion at each instant of time during the
pulse.
It is instead the variation of the ionization and
excitation rate with intensity in the focal volume that
leads to a departure from a conventional FC-like distri-
bution. The theory is very versatile and readily adapted
to a wide range of diatomic molecules.

We note that as the strong ﬁeld response of the molec-
ular ion is very dependent on the distribution over vibra-
tional levels, it is desirable to be able to control the latter.
We show by explicit examples in H2, O2 and N2 that a
simple change of the peak intensity of a 45 fs Gaussian
pulse leads to a signiﬁcant degree of control over the ﬁ-
nal vibrational distribution, and hence holds the promise
for the production of a target of interest for state-speciﬁc
studies.

The energy absorbed by a molecule in the ﬁeld is dis-
tributed among the electrons and nuclei.
Ionization of
molecules is accordingly accompanied by a vibrational
excitation of the nuclear motion in the ion formed. To
illustrate the accuracy of our approach, we ﬁrst con-
sider H2 for which strong-ﬁeld experiments are avail-
able [4, 5, 6]. For H2 both photoelectron spectroscopy
with HeI light sources [7] and ionization by 100 eV elec-
tron impact [4] resulted in vibrational distributions of
H+
2 in accordance with the FC principle, i.e., governed
by the projection of the initial vibrational ground state
wave function ν′ = 0 onto the set of vibrational states
of the molecular ion, ν. In recent experiments [4, 5, 6],
the vibrational distribution of H+
2 was measured after
ionization of H2 by intense laser ﬁelds. These exper-
iments revealed very diﬀerent vibrational distributions
than the other types of experiments mentioned above.
The laser-induced ionization leads to a narrower distri-
bution with almost no population in the ﬁnal vibrational
levels above ν = 4, and the actual shape of the distri-
bution depends on the peak laser intensity and wave-
length. At low intensities, the maximum population is
observed in the ν = 0 state while the FC principle pre-
dicts a maximum population in the ν = 2 state. These
results can be partly explained by a theoretical tunneling
model with an electronic binding energy which depends
on the internuclear distance [4, 5, 6]. However, the ex-
perimental conditions in some of the experiments [6] do
not correspond to a pure tunneling regime, and a further
shortcoming of the model is that it cannot account for
any variation in the distribution with wavelength. It is
therefore desirable to apply a theory that is expected to
be valid also in the multiphoton regime. An example of
such a theory is the molecular strong-ﬁeld approxima-
tion with the inclusion of nuclear motion [8, 9, 10], and
here we apply this theory along the lines discussed in
detail in [8]. For a linearly polarized laser of frequency
ω and periodicity T = 2π/ω, the rate of ionization dif-
ferential in the direction ˆq of the ejected electron, to a
particular vibrational state of the molecular ion after ab-
sorption of n photons is dWf i/d ˆq = 2 π|Af i|2qn [atomic

units, e = ~ = me = a0 = 1, are used throughout]. The
magnitude of the momentum qn is determined by energy
conservation and Af i is the transition amplitude,

Af i = Sf i

hf (t)|VF (t)|i(t)idt,

where Sf i is the FC factor corresponding to the nuclear
vibrational transition, VF (t) is the length gauge form for
the molecule-light interaction and |i(t)i and |f (t)i are
the initial and ﬁnal electronic states, respectively, in-
cluding energy phases for the nuclear motion.
In the
theory, the initial state is the highest occupied molec-
ular orbital, and in the ﬁnal state it is assumed that
the laser-electron interaction is much stronger than the
electron-molecule interaction, such that the ﬁnal state
of the electron can be accurately described by a Volkov
wave. In (1), the electronic matrix element is evaluated
at the equilibrium distance of the nuclei in accordance
with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This allows
us to pull outside the integral the overlap between the
nuclear wavefunctions expressed by the FC factor. We
assume the temperature be suﬃciently low that only the
vibrational ground state of the initial state be populated.
We integrate over all directions of the outgoing electron
and sum over all accessible numbers of photon absorp-
tions to obtain the total rate of ionization to the vibra-
tional state considered. Finally, and this turns out to be
essential, we integrate the total rates over the Gaussian
spatial and temporal proﬁle of the laser pulse and av-
erage over molecular orientations for direct comparison
with experimental data. The spatial integration is car-
ried out over the interaction region which is restricted
to a small volume around the beam waist in the experi-
ment. With such an experimental setup it is not diﬃcult
to show that relative signals are independent of focal spot
size.

In Fig. 1, we present the experimental and theoreti-
cal vibrational distribution of H+
2 produced by strong-
ﬁeld ionization of H2 for two diﬀerent intensities. For
comparison also squared FC factors are shown. At both
intensities, we ﬁnd good agreement between experiment
and theory. Both distributions favor the lower vibrational
states in contrast to the FC distribution.

Our aim is to provide a widely applicable model and
therefore we simply use the ﬁeld-free FC factors. These
are readily available in the literature for a wide range
of molecules. In reality, the ﬁeld-free nuclear potential
curves are distorted by a very intense laser ﬁeld, e.g., in
H+
2 this eﬀect leads to a bond-softening due to a coupling
between the lowest Σg and Σu states. As the potential is
changed, a new set of vibrational eigenstates and corre-
sponding FC factors needs to be considered. If, however,
2
the intensity is below 5 × 1013 W/cm
the ﬁeld-induced
modiﬁcation of the potential curve is minimal [4] and the
application of the ﬁeld-free FC factors will be accurate.

Also, we note that dissociating channels become increas-
2
ingly important as the intensity exceeds 5 × 1013 W/cm
,
and since one is often interested in making subsequent
experiments on the bound molecular ion we will not con-
sider such intensities here.

Even though the FC principle is explicitly used in our
theory [see Eq. (1)], the predicted and observed vibra-
tional distributions deviate signiﬁcantly from the FC dis-
tribution. The key concept explaining this discrepancy is
the eﬀect of channel closings in connection with full ac-
count of the pulse proﬁle. By energy consideration, the
number of absorbed photons n must fulﬁl the criterion
nω = q2
p the ionization po-
tential to the level ν and Up = I/(4ω2) the quiver energy
of a free electron in the laser ﬁeld of intensity I. The pres-
ence of Up means that the minimum number of photons
needed to reach the electronic continuum and a particu-
lar vibrational state ν in the ion increases with intensity.
This phenomena is referred to as channel closing and the
eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we show the ionization

rates to the lowest vibrational levels of H+
2 when ionizing
molecules aligned parallel to the laser ﬁeld at a wave-
2
length of 800 nm. At an intensity of 1 × 1013 W/cm
all
the vibrational states shown can be reached by absorp-
tion of 11 photons. As the intensity increases the thresh-
olds shift upwards by Up and at the intensities marked
by arrows, absorption of 11 photons becomes insuﬃcient
to reach the vibrational levels indicated. For example, in
2
the intensity range of 2.3 − 2.7 × 1013W/cm
one needs
n ≥ 12 photons to reach the ν ≥ 1 levels whereas n = 11
is suﬃcient for ν = 0. Since the rates for higher or-
der processes (n ≥ 12) are much lower than the rate for
n = 11, this explains why the ν = 0 is favored by a factor
of 3 over ν = {1, 2}. Contrary, when the same number of
photons is needed to reach all ν levels, the rate to ν = 0
is generally lower than to ν = {1, 2} due to the smaller
FC factor of the former.

The reason for ﬁnding a very diﬀerent relative rela-
tionship between the signals at the peak intensity of
2
3 × 1013W/cm
, Fig. 1 (a), and the rates at the same in-
tensity is a result of taking the pulse shape into account.
Only in the very center of the Gaussian laser beam the
intensity reaches the peak intensity. In other regions of
space the molecules are exposed to a lower intensity and
excitation to ν = 0 dominates.

Sofar we have seen that the vibrational distribution
depends remarkably on the intensity. Our next purpose
is to investigate how the laser pulse can be shaped to
maximize the population in a given vibrational state. A
high degree of population transfer to a deﬁnite state will
be a valuable result as it will allow for the possibility of
making state-speciﬁc experiments on the molecular ion.
To our knowledge, such type of control has not previ-
ously been explored in strong-ﬁeld physics. We have
chosen to shape the pulse by a simple variation of the
peak intensity with the purpose of maximizing the ν = 0
population. We have performed the optimization at the
wavelengths corresponding to the fundamental- and fre-
quency doubled wavelengths of the Ti:Sapphire (400 nm
and 800 nm) and Nd:YAG (532 nm and 1064 nm) lasers.
During optimization the pulse duration is ﬁxed at 45 fs
and 6 ns for the Ti:Sapphire and Nd:YAG wavelengths,
respectively.

The result of the intensity optimization is shown in
Fig. 3. At the shortest wavelength, 400 nm, a relative
population as large as 75% is produced in the vibrational
2
ground state at an intensity of 2 × 1012 W/cm
. At lower
intensities we can get nearly 100% in the ν = 0 state but
at such low intensities that the ion yields are very low. In
our model, the reason for obtaining such a conﬁned dis-
tribution is that the ion yield is completely dominated by
5-photonabsorption which is only possible to the ν = 0
2
state and only at intensities below 4.9 × 1012W/cm
. We
note that this explanation of the favoring of the ν = 0
level is diﬀerent from a previous suggestion oﬀering an ex-
planation in terms of resonance enhanced ionization [6].

Figure 3: The vibrational distribution of H+
2 after ioniza-
tion in an intense laser ﬁeld according to the present the-
ory (gray bars). The Franck-Condon distribution is indi-
cated with white bars. The peak laser intensity is cho-
sen to maximize the population in the lowest vibrational
state. The laser wavelengths are (a) 400 nm, (b) 532 nm, (c)
800 nm, and (d) 1064 nm, and the peak intensities are (a)
2.0×1012 W/cm2, (b) 2.7×1013 W/cm2, (c) 2.6×1013 W/cm2,
and (d) 1.9 × 1013 W/cm2. The pulse duration is 45 fs in pan-
els (a) and (c), and 6 ns in panels (b) and (d).

As the wavelength increases the selection of the ν = 0
becomes less eﬃcient. At all wavelengths the optimum
intensity is relatively low and it will always correspond to
an intensity which is slightly below the occurrence of the
ﬁrst channel closing. The decreasing ν = 0 population
with increasing wavelength was also observed experimen-
tally [5, 6], and the general phenomenon that the largest
population in the vibrational ground state is obtained at
relatively low intensities is in good agreement with the
experiments.

We note that the present control obtained by changing
intensity and/or wavelength is not only the simplest way
of gaining control, it is probably also the only one. If,
e.g., one considers the possibility of coherent control by
preparing either a coherent superposition of initial vibra-
tional states separated by the energy of one photon or by
utilizing a bichromatic ﬁeld and optimizing the strengths
and relative phase of the two components of the ﬁeld, one
faces the problem of a continuum of ﬁnal states. With
a proper choice of amplitudes and phase it is possible to
exclude the transition to one particular ﬁnal state which
is characterized by the vibrational state and the direc-
tion and energy of the outgoing electron. However, one
cannot gain control over the transition to all other ﬁnal
states and hence an eﬃcient selection cannot be made.

In all

in panels (a) and (b). Maximization of the population in the

brational states are populated after ionization.
If one
considers molecules where only a few FC factors are im-
portant, one may hope for a more eﬃcient optimization.
To this end, and to illustrate the wide applicability of
the present formalism, we investigated ionization of N2
and O2 where the number of ﬁnal vibrational states are
limited to ν ≤ 1 and 4, respectively, simply because the
other FC factors are vanishingly small. First, we calcu-
lated the vibrational distribution with a laser wavelength
of 800 nm, pulse duration of 45 fs and with a typical, but
2
arbitrarily chosen, peak intenstity of 5×1013 W/cm
. We
then made an optimization similar to that for H2 and the
results are given in Fig. 4. The vibrational distributions
obtained with a typical peak intensity, Figs. 4 (a) and (b),
are quite similar to the FC distributions. Figure 4 (a)
shows typical and Fig. 4 (c) optimized vibrational distri-
bution of N+
2 after ionization of N2. For N2, only two
states will be populated in N+
2 and we see that the FC
factors strongly favour the ν = 0 state (90%). By utiliz-
ing a non-optimized strong laser ﬁeld we obtain a ν = 0
population of 94% [Fig. 4 (a)], and if we use an optimized
laser intensity we may reach a ν = 0 population of 97%
[Fig. 4 (c)]. In Figs. 4 (b) and (d) we present the results
for O2 and we see that an eﬃcient selection of the ν = 0
state can also be obtained for this molecule. We ﬁnd the
optimal population to be 80% [Fig. 4 (d)] compared with
the FC distribution of 24% and the non-optimized result
of 30% [Fig. 4 (b)]. When we compare the results of N2
and O2 with the results of H2 at the same wavelength
[Fig. 3 (c)], we see that the former molecules can indeed

4

be brought to the ν = 0 state more eﬃciently due to the
limited number of ﬁnal vibrational states.

In conclusion,

the molecular strong-ﬁeld approxi-
mation with the inclusion of nuclear vibrational mo-
tion explains the recently observed vibrational distribu-
tions of H+
2 produced by strong-ﬁeld ionization of H2
molecules [4]. The theoretical and experimental distri-
butions are both very diﬀerent from distributions pre-
dicted by Franck-Condon factors – a result that can be
explained by the eﬀects of channel closings in associa-
tion with the spatial and temporal extend of the laser
pulse. The theory is simple to evaluate and therefore
readily applicable to diatomic molecules. We proposed a
very simple method of optimizing the population in the
ν = 0 state by varying the peak laser intensity. With
this type of optimization we showed that the vibrational
distributions vary signiﬁcantly with the laser wavelength
in accordance with experimental ﬁndings. Finally, we ap-
plied the theory to N2 and O2 and found that a higher
degree of control can be obtained than in H2 due to the
FC factors which are non-vanishing for fewer states in the
former cases. We note that eﬃcient control of population
distributions will be of great value in the development of
state-speciﬁc experiments on molecular ions.

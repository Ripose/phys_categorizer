Abstract

A part of the two-loop self-energy correction, the so-called P term, is evalu-

ated numerically for the 1s state to all orders in Zα. Our calculation, com-

bined with the previous investigation [S. Mallampalli and J. Sapirstein, Phys.

Rev. A 57, 1548 (1998)], yields the total answer for the two-loop self-energy

correction in H-like uranium and bismuth. As a result, the major uncertainty

is eliminated from the theoretical prediction for the Lamb shift in these sys-

tems. The total value of the ground-state Lamb shift in H-like uranium is

found to be 463.93(50) eV.

INTRODUCTION

The calculation of all two-loop QED diagrams for the Lamb shift of H-like ions is one

of the most challenging problems in bound-state QED. The experimental accuracy of 1 eV

aimed at in measurements of the ground-state Lamb shift in H-like uranium [1] requires a

calculation of the complete set of QED corrections of the order α2 without any expansion

in the parameter Zα (Z is the nuclear charge number, α is the ﬁne structure constant). In

high-Z Li-like ions, these diagrams are the source of the major theoretical uncertainty for

the 2p1/2-2s transition energy [2] and, therefore, the limiting factor in comparison of theory

and experiment. Also in the low-Z region, the two-loop Lamb shift is important from the

experimental point of view [3]. What is more, its Zα expansion exhibits a rather peculiar

behavior, with a very slow convergence even in case of hydrogen [3]. In order to eliminate the

uncertainty due to higher-order contributions, it is important to perform a non-perturbative

(in Zα) calculation of two-loop corrections even in the low-Z region.

The most problematic part of the one-electron α2 contribution is the two-loop self-energy

correction, represented diagramatically in Fig. 1. The diagram in Fig. 1(a) is usually divided

into two parts, which are referred to as the irreducible and the reducible contribution. (The

reducible contribution is deﬁned as a part of this diagram in which intermediate states in

the spectral decomposition of the middle electron propagator coincide with the initial state.)

The irreducible contribution (also referred to as the loop-after-loop correction) can be shown

to be gauge invariant when covariant gauges are used. Its evaluation is not very cumbersome

and was accomplished in several independent investigations [4–6].

The reducible part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a) should be evaluated together with the

remaining two diagrams in Fig. 1. This calculation is by far more diﬃcult. The ﬁrst attempt

to attack this problem was performed by Mallampalli and Sapirstein [7]. In that work, the

contribution of interest was rearranged into three parts (referred to by the authors as the

M, P, and F terms), only two of which were actually evaluated. The remaining part (the P

term) was left out since a new numerical technique had to be developed for its computation.

In our present investigation, we perform the numerical evaluation of the missing part of the

two-loop self-energy, the P term. Results of our evaluation, added to those from Ref. [7],

yield the ﬁnal answer for the total two-loop self-energy correction for H-like uranium and

bismuth. This result disagrees with the resent calculation of the total contribution reported

by Goidenko et al. [8], which is based on the partial-wave renormalization approach.

The plan of the paper is the following. The basic formulas needed for the evaluation

of the P term are given in the ﬁrst section, alongside with the discussion of the treatment

of ultraviolet and infrared divergences. In the next section we formulate the scheme of the

numerical evaluation and give some technical details. Numerical results are discussed in the

last section. In that section we also collect all second-order contributions to the ground-state

Lamb shift of H-like uranium and to the 2p1/2-2s transition energy in Li-like uranium. In

the latter case, the two-loop self-energy contribution is estimated by scaling the 1s result.

In this paper, we use the relativistic units (¯h = c = m = 1). The roman style (p) is used

for four vectors, bold face (p) for three vectors and italic style (p) for scalars. Four vectors

have the form p ≡ (p0, p). The scalar product of two four vectors is (p · k) = p0k0 − (p · k).

We use the notations p/ = pµγµ, ˆp = p/|p|.

I. BASIC FORMALISM

In this paper we are concerned with the evaluation of the correction

∆E = ∆EN 1 + ∆EN 2 + 2∆EO1 ,

(1)

where the contributions ∆EN 1, ∆EN 2, and ∆EO1 are represented by Feynman diagrams

shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Our consideration of these three sets of Feynman

diagrams should be considered as an investigation, complementary to Ref. [7], to which we

refer hereafter as I. In our calculation we use the Feynman gauge and the point nuclear

model, the same as in I. Our results, combined with those from I, should yield the complete

answer for the two-loop self-energy correction.

All the contribution ∆EN 1, ∆EN 2, and ∆EO1 are ultraviolet (UV) divergent. Following

I, we refer to their UV-ﬁnite part as the “P term”. We note that subtractions in these

contributions are chosen in such a way that each of them is free from overlapping divergences.

The main problem in the evaluation of these diagrams is that they contain bound electron

propagators as well as UV divergences. While UV divergences are normally separated in

momentum space, the Dirac-Coulomb Green function is generally treated in the coordinate

representation. The most direct way for the calculation of the P term consists in developing

a numerical scheme for the evaluation of the Dirac Coulomb Green function in momentum

space, which is one of the aims of the present work.

The nested contributions, ∆EN 1 and ∆EN 2, possess in addition some infrared (IR)

divergences, which are associated with the so-called reference-state singularities. These

divergences are cancelled out when considered together with the corresponding parts of the

reducible contribution of the diagram in Fig. 1(a). Following I, we handle the IR divergences

by introducing a regulator. This makes clear that great care should be taken in order

to separate all divergences exactly in the same way as in I, in order not to miss a ﬁnite

contribution.

A. One-loop self-energy

We start with some basic formulas for the ﬁrst-order self-energy correction. The formal

expression for the unrenormalized ﬁrst-order self-energy matrix element in the Feynman

We note that while the integration over ω in Eq. (4) can be carried out by Cauchy’s theorem,

we prefer to keep it, having in mind future generalizations to the two-loop case.

The renormalization of the one-loop self-energy is well known. In our work, we employ

the method based on the expansion of the bound electron propagator in Eq. (2) in terms of

the interaction with the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld [9]. For the detailed description of our renor-

malization procedure we refer the reader to [10]. The renormalized self-energy correction is

represented by the sum of three ﬁnite terms,

the substitution G(εa − ω, x1, x2) → GN 1(εa − ω, x1, x2) , where

and Σ(0)(p) is the free one-loop self-energy operator deﬁned in Appendix A.

The expression for the ﬁrst diagram in Fig. 3 is obtained from Eq. (2) by the replacement

The expressions for the remaining diagrams in Figs. 2–4 are obtained in a similar way,

by replacing the Dirac-Coulomb Green function G in Eqs. (12), (15), and (16) by G(0) or

G(1).

C. Separation of ultraviolet divergences

In this section we isolate the UV-ﬁnite part of ∆E. Following I, we refer to this contri-

bution as the P term. Considering the renormalization of the diagrams in Fig. 2, we should

keep in mind that the inner self-energy loops are always accompanied by the corresponding

mass counterterms.

The renormalization of the one-loop self-energy and vertex operators is deﬁned in Ap-

pendix A. To handle the UV divergences, we regularize them by working in D = 4 − ǫ

dimensions. The resulting expressions are

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

Σ(0)(p) − δm = ˜B(1)(p/ − m) + Σ(0)

R (p) ,

Γµ(p1, p2) = ˜L(1)γµ + Γµ

R(p1, p2) ,

where ˜B(1) and ˜L(1) are UV-divergent constants, and Σ(0)

R (p) and Γµ

R(p1, p2) are ﬁnite. Ac-

cording to the Ward identity, ˜B(1) = − ˜L(1).

For the renormalization of the two-loop self-energy diagrams, we refer the reader to a

(very pedagogical) description given by Fox and Yennie [11]. Applying their arguments to

the diagrams in Figs. 2–4, we have

∆EN 1 + ∆EN 2 = ˜B(1)∆E(1)

many,D + ∆EN 1

P + ∆EN 2
P

,

2∆EO1 = 2 ˜L(1)∆E(1)

many,D + 2∆EO1
P ,

where the subscript P means that the corresponding contribution is UV convergent, and

the subscript D of ∆E(1)

many,D indicates that this correction should be evaluated in D dimen-

sions, keeping terms of order ǫ. (These terms yield a ﬁnite contribution when multiplied by

divergent renormalization constants.)

The resulting expression reads

∆E = ˜L(1)∆E(1)

many,D + ∆EN 1

P + ∆EN 2

P + 2∆EO1
P .

(21)

Here, the correction ∆EN 1

can be obtained from the corresponding expression for ∆EN 1

P

by the replacement Σ(0)(p) → Σ(0)

R (p), and the corrections ∆EN 2
P

and ∆EO1

P – by the cor-

responding substitution Γµ(p1, p2) → Γµ

R(p1, p2). Since all the P-terms are UV-convergent,

in their evaluation we can disregard terms of order ǫ in deﬁnition of Σ(0)

R (p) and Γµ

R(p1, p2).

We note also that the UV-divergent part of ∆E separated in Eq. (21), exactly corresponds

to that in I.

D. Separation of infrared divergences

Infrared divergences occur in the corrections ∆EN 1

P and ∆EN 2

P due to so-called reference-

state singularities. They arise when the energy of intermediate states in the spectral de-

composition of both electron propagators in Eqs. (12), (15) coincide with the energy of the

reference state varea. As shown, e.g., in I, the divergent terms disappear when considered

together with the related contributions from the reducible part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a).

However, since we are going to evaluate the contributions ∆EN 1

and ∆EN 2

P

P

separately, a

proper regularization of the IR divergences is needed. In order to preserve the compatibil-

ity of our results with those of I, we have to employ exactly the same procedure for the

regularization of the IR divergences.

Following I, we introduce in the IR-divergent parts of ∆EN 1

P , ∆EN 2

P a regulator δ which

modiﬁes the location of the reference-state pole of the Green function, εa → εa(1 + δ). After

that, we have for the IR-divergent part of ∆EN 1

by the corresponding terms in Eqs. (50) and (55) of I.

II. NUMERICAL EVALUATION

A. Green function in the mixed representation

The main problem of the numerical evaluation of the P terms is that they involve the

Dirac-Coulomb Green function in momentum space. Until recently, there has been no con-

venient method for its evaluation. As was pointed out in I, new numerical tools should be

developed for the calculation of the P terms.

Here we address two main features which allow us to evaluate the P terms. Firstly, we

express them in a form which involves the Fourier transform of the Green function over

only one radial variable [Eqs. (13) and (14)]. We refer to this as the mixed (momentum-

coordinate) representation. Secondly, we develop a convenient scheme for the numerical

evaluation of the Green function in the mixed representation. This scheme was proposed

and tested in our previous evaluation of the irreducible part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a) (the

loop-after-loop contribution) [6]. Here we describe the basic idea of this approach.

We start from the B-splines method for the Dirac equation [12]. For a ﬁxed angular-

momentum quantum number κ, it provides a ﬁnite set of radial wave functions

where the superscript i = 1, 2 indicates the upper and the lower component of the radial

wave function, and n numerates the wave functions in the set. The wave functions are found

as a linear combination of the B-splines [13],

ϕi

κ,n(x) =

(28)

Xl

where {Bl(x)}, l = 1, 2, . . . is the set of the B-splines deﬁned on the grid {xl}. Since each

of Bl(x) can be represented as a piecewise polynomial, we can build the corresponding

piecewise-polynomial representation for the wave functions,

ϕi

κ,n(x) =

k(κ, n, l) (x − xl)k ,

x ∈ [xl, xl+1] .

Consequently, the radial Dirac-Coulomb Green function in the coordinate space, deﬁned

as

can be written in an analogous form,

X

At this point, we have built the Dirac-Coulomb Green function in the piecewise-polynomial

form. This representation is very convenient for the numerical evaluation. After the coeﬃ-

cients Aij

k1k2 are stored for given values of κ and ε, the computation of the Green function is

reduced to the evaluation of a simple polynomial over each of the radial variables. We note

one additional advantage of this representation of the Green function, as compared to its

closed analytical form. The Green function in the form (31) and its derivative are continuous

(30)

(31)

(32)

functions of the radial arguments, while its analytic representation contains a discontinuous

function θ(x1 − x2) (see, e.g., [14]).

Now we turn to the Green function in the mixed representation. The Fourier transform

of the radial Green function over the second radial argument can be written as

κ (ε, x1, p2) = 4πs(Lj)

dx2 x2

2 jLj (p2x2) Gij

κ (ε, x1, x2) ,

(33)

where L1,2 = |κ ± 1/2| − 1/2, s(L1) = 1, s(L2) = −κ/|κ|, and jL(z) denotes the spherical

Bessel function. Introducing the Fourier-transformed basic polynomials,

Πik

l (p) = 4πs(Li)

(34)

we write the Green function in the mixed representation,

Certainly, a computation in the mixed representation is essentially more time-consuming

than that in coordinate space, due to necessity to evaluate the whole set of the integrals

(37)

The next step is to perform the Wick rotation of the ω-integration contour in Eq. (36).

This is very convenient for the numerical evaluation since, ﬁrstly, the Dirac Green function

as well as the photon propagator are exponentially decaying functions for imaginary values of

ω. Secondly, by this deformation of the contour we escape most of the problems connected

with poles of the electron propagators and with the analytic structure of Σ(0)

R (ε). The

analysis given in Appendix B shows that Σ(0)

R (εa − ω) as a function of real ω allows the

analytical continuation to the ﬁrst quadrant of the complex plane starting from the right

half of the real axis, and to the third quadrant from the left half of the axis. Therefore,

we can rotate the integration contour on the imaginary axis dividing ∆EN 1

P,r into two pieces,

P,Im corresponding to the integral along the imaginary axis, and the pole term ∆EN 1

that arises from the pole of electron propagator with εn = εa. (At this moment, we assume

We note that instead of dividing ∆EN 1

P

into three parts, we could have introduced the

regulator δ right from the beginning in ∆EN 1

P , as it was done in I for the “M terms”.

However, this would cause a rapidly varying structure of the integrand in the low-ω region,

which makes calculations much more time-consuming. (E.g., for the pole term introducing a

regulator would involve a numerical evaluation of the integral which yields the δ-function in

the limit δ → 0.) In our approach, on the contrary, only the IR-divergent part is evaluated

with the regulator; the corresponding calculation is relatively simple and allows accurate

ﬁtting to the form (26).

Let us now outline essential features of our numerical evaluation. As can be seen, the

dependence of the functions GN 1 and Gpole

N 1 on the angular parts of x1 and x2 is exactly

the same as that of the Dirac Green function. Therefore, the angular integration causes

no problems and can be performed by a straightforward generalization of formulas given in

Ref. [10]. The most problematic part of the numerical evaluation of ∆EN 1

is the calculation

P

of ∆EN 1

P,Im. All numerical integrations were performed by the Gauss-Legendre quadratures.

The ordering of integrations in our computation coincides with that of Eq. (38), with the

summation over the angular-momentum quantum number of intermediate states κ moved

outside. For each value of κ and ω, we store three sets of complex coeﬃcients Aij

k1k2 cor-

responding to the functions G, G(0), and G(1). For each value of p, we calculate also a set

of the Fourier-transformed polynomials Πik

l (p). After this, the integrations over the radial

variables x1, x2 are performed. This scheme is rather eﬃcient and was used for the evalu-

ation of ∆EN 1

P,Im. The corrections ∆EN 1

P,infr and ∆EN 1

P,pole were calculated in several diﬀerent

ways, which served as a good test for our numerical procedure.

The actual calculation was performed with the basis set constructed typically with 50-

60 B-splines of order 6 and employing the point nuclear model. The cavity size of 1 a.u.

was employed for Z = 80, which was scaled as γ/Z with Z, γ =

1 − (αZ)2. We use

an exponential grid with the ﬁrst knot of about 0.001 a.u.

for Z = 80. This particular

q

grid was chosen since it yields an optimal convergence in the evaluation of the ﬁrst-order

self-energy correction with respect to the number of knots. The inﬁnite summation over the

angular-momentum quantum number of intermediate states κ was terminated typically at

|κmax| = 7. The tail of the expansion was estimated by polynomial ﬁtting in 1/|κ|. The

results of the numerical evaluation of the individual contributions to ∆EN 1

P are presented in

Table I for Z = 83, 90, and 92. The numerical errors, quoted in the table, originate mainly

from the sensitivity of the result to the number of knots and diﬀerent grids.

Here, we again separate the IR-divergent part [Eq. (27)] and perform the Wick rotation of

the ω-integration contour, separating the corresponding pole contribution (∆EN 2

P,pole). We

note that the rotation of the contour is possible because the vertex operator Γµ(εa−ω, εa−ω)

as a function of real ω allows an analytic continuation in the region of interest, as shown in

Appendix C. The resulting expression reads

The angular integration in these expressions is straightforward, due to the fact that the

functions GN 2 and Gpole

N 2 have the same dependence on the angular parts of x1 and x2 as the

Dirac Green function G. The numerical evaluation of the correction ∆EN 2

P,Im is much more

(44)

(45)

(46)

time-consuming than that of ∆EN 1

P,Im. This is because the integration over |p| in Eq. (38)

(after the angular integration has been carried out) is substituted by the triple integration

over |p1|, |p2|, and ξ = (ˆp1 · ˆp2). So, the numerical evaluation of ∆EN 2

P,Im involves one inﬁnite

partial-wave summation and a seven-fold numerical integration. (One additional integral

comes from the evaluation of the Green function in the mixed representation.) While it

is possible to evaluate ∆EN 2

P,Im in a similar way as ∆EN 1

P,Im, we have found a more eﬃcient

method for its computation. To this end, we rewrite Eq. (44) as follows

An analogous matrix S(0) is introduced also for the second part of Eq. (48). For each value

Then, for each values of p1 and p2, we store two sets of the Fourier-transformed polynomials,

Πik

vertex operator Γµ

R(εa − ω, εa) as a function of real ω allows the analytical continuation to

the ﬁrst quadrant of the complex ω plane starting from the right half of the real axis, and

to the third quadrant from the left half of the axis. Therefore, we can perform the Wick

rotation of the integration contour, separating the corresponding pole contribution,

∆EO1

P = ∆EO1

P,pole + ∆EO1

P,Im .

(51)

The angular integration in Eq. (50) is by far more diﬃcult as compared to the contribu-

tions considered so far. As the involved expressions are rather lengthy, we do not give their

detailed consideration here. However, in order to give the reader an idea how the angular

integration is performed, we note that Eq. (16) is very similar to the free-vertex contribution

which is encountered in a calculation of the self-energy screening diagrams (compare with

Eq. (68) in Ref. [15]). Basically, the angular integration in Eq. (50) is the same as described

in detail in Ref. [15]. The only diﬀerence is that in Ref. [15] the integration was demon-

strated for two particular states, n = 2p1/2 and 2s. In Eq. (50) we need a generalization of

that procedure for an arbitrary n, which is somewhat tedious but straightforward.

Let us discuss now the numerical evaluation of ∆EO1

P . After the angular integration is

carried out, a typical contribution to ∆EO1

P,Im can be written as follows

κ

denotes a radial component of G(2+), jL is a spherical Bessel

function, and f (p1, p2, ξ) originates from the vertex operator. Eq. (52) involves one inﬁnite

partial-wave summation and a six-fold numerical integration.

(The sixth integral is the

momentum integration in the evaluation of the Green function in the mixed representation.

Two additional integrations can be also mentioned, one over the Feynman parameter in

the evaluation of f (p1, p2, ξ), and another a radial integration in the computation of G(1).

This makes the total dimension of the integral to be 8.) Two of these integrations involve

spherical Bessel functions, which oscillate strongly in the high-momenta region. In order to

keep the amount of computational time within an acceptable limit, the general scheme of the

calculation should be chosen carefully. In our approach, we introduce the following change

of variables [10]: {p1, p2, ξ} → {x, y, q}, where x = p1 +p2, y = p> −p<, q2 = p2

In the actual calculation, the outermost loop was the summation over κ. The next

loop is the ω integration. For given values of κ and ω, we store a set of coeﬃcients of

the piecewise-polynomial representation of G(2+)

. These coeﬃcients are obtained as the

κ

diﬀerence of the corresponding coeﬃcients for Gκ, G(0)

κ , and G(1)

κ , as stated in Eq. (11). The

next two loops are the integrations over x and y. For each value of p1, we store a set of the

Fourier-transformed polynomials Πik

l (p1). The next step is the integration over q and the

evaluation of f (p1, p2, ξ), which involves an integration over the Feynman parameter (see,

e.g., Ref. [10]). The innermost loop is the integration over z. Its optimization is the most

critical part from the point of view of computational time. For small values of q, we use

Gauss-Legendre quadratures. When q is large, we decompose jl(qx) in a combination of

sin(qx) and cos(qx), and use the standard routine for the sin- and cos-Fourier transforms

based on the generalized Clenshaw-Curtis algorithm. At that stage of the computation, both

a and G(2+)ij
ϕi

κ

are represented by piecewise polynomials and, therefore, the z integration

can be performed rather fast.

A good test for our numerical procedure is to evaluate the many-potential part of the

ﬁrst-oder self-energy correction, which can be obtained from Eq. (50) by the substitution

Γµ
R → γµ.

The results of the numerical calculation of the individual contributions to ∆EO1
P

are

presented in Table III for Z = 83, 90, and 92.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this paper we present the numerical evaluation of the correction ∆E, given by the

three sets of diagrams which are shown in Figs. 2–4. Putting together Eqs. (1), (21), (42),

The UV-ﬁnite diﬀerence ∆E − ˜L(1)∆E(1)

many,D corresponds to what in I is called the P term.

The IR-divergent contributions, still presented in the P term, are cancelled when considered

together with Eqs. (50) and (55) of I. When all δ-dependent terms are put together, the

limit δ → 0 can be taken, and contributions of order δ and higher vanish. Finite individual

contributions to ∆EN 1

P , ∆EN 2

P , and ∆EO1

P are listed in Tables I–III, respectively. In Table IV

we collect all ﬁnite contributions to ∆E.

Now we can obtain a ﬁnite, gauge-independent (within the covariant gauges) result for

the sum of the diagrams in Figs. 1(b,c) and the reducible part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a).

In order to get this, we should add together the contributions listed in Table IV, the results

from I for the M terms (Eqs. (50), (52), and (55) of I) and those for the F terms (Table IV

of I). This yields −0.903(11) eV for the ground state of H-like uranium and −0.575(11) eV

for bismuth. Adding this to the irreducible part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a) (−0.971 eV for

Z = 92 [4,5] and −0.544 eV for Z = 83, this work), we have for the total two-loop self-energy

correction, given by the diagrams in Fig. 1, −1.874(11) eV for Z = 92 and −1.119(11) eV

for Z = 83.

The numerical results for the sum of the diagrams in Figs. 1(b,c) and the reducible

part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a), obtained by combining the present calculation with that

of I, can be compared with the recent evaluation announced in Ref. [8]. The results of

−0.903(11) eV (Z = 92) and −0.575(11) eV (Z = 83) obtained in this work should be

compared with 1.28(15) eV and 0.73(9) eV, respectively, reported in Ref. [8]. Surprisingly

enough, the comparison shows that the results disagree even with respect to the overall sign

of the contribution. Commenting this disagreement, one can mention that the partial-wave

renormalization procedure, used in Ref. [8], is known to produce certain spurious terms due

to the noncovariant nature of the regularization (see Ref. [16] and a discussion given in

Refs. [17,6]). We also note that some assumptions employed in the numerical evaluation of

Ref. [8] make it diﬃcult to keep accuracy under proper control in the computation. Still,

in order to resolve this disagreement, it is desirable to perform an evaluation of the total

two-loop self-energy correction within the covariant approach from the beginning up to the

end by the same authors. This will be the aim of our future investigation.

With this evaluation of the two-loop self-energy correction, we complete the long-lasting

problem of calculation of all second-order (in α) QED corrections for the hydrogen-like ions

without an expansion in the parameter Zα. The complete set of these corrections is presented

in Fig. 5. The whole set is conveniently divided into several gauge invariant subsets: SESE

(a-c), VPVP (d), VPVP (e), VPVP (f), SEVP (g-i), S(VP)E (k). In Table V we collect all

available contributions to the ground-state Lamb shift in 238U91+. The nuclear-size correction

is calculated for the Fermi nuclear model with hr2i1/2 = 5.860(2) fm [18]. The uncertainty

of 0.38 eV ascribed to the nuclear-size eﬀect is evaluated as the diﬀerence between the

corrections obtained within the Fermi model and with the homogeneously-charged sphere

distribution, employing the same rms radius. Some of the α2 QED corrections [VPVP

(f) and S(VP)E (k)] are evaluated only within the Uehling approximation at present. We

ascribe the uncertainty of 50% to them. To obtain the binding energy, the Dirac point-

nucleus eigenvalue of −132279.92(1) eV should be added to the Lamb shift presented in

Table V. The error of 0.01 eV of the Dirac binding energy results from the uncertainty of

the Rydberg constant [19]. As can be seen from the table, the present level of experimental

precision provides a test of QED eﬀects of ﬁrst order in α on the level of 5%.

With the two-loop self-energy calculated for the 1s state, we can estimate its value for

the 2p1/2-2s transition in Li-like ions. As is known, the leading contribution to the self-

energy arises from small distances, where the self-energy operator is close to a δ-functional

potential. This gives the well-known 1/n3 scaling for the s-states and zero for the p-states.

Assuming this scaling, we have a 0.23(20) eV contribution for the one-electron two-loop self-

energy correction to the 2p1/2-2s transition energy in Li-like uranium. Now we collect all

second-order QED contributions to this transition energy in uranium, as shown in Table VI.

In the ﬁrst line of the table, our previous result of 280.48(11) eV [2] is given, in which all

available contributions are included, except one-electron second-order QED eﬀects. The

total value of the transition energy amounts to 280.64(11)(21) eV, which agrees well with

the experimental result of 280.59(10) eV [34]. In the theoretical prediction, the ﬁrst quoted

error arises from the uncertainty due to the ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect and due to higher-order

electron correlations (see discussion in Ref. [2]). The second quoted error corresponds to the

uncertainty of the second-order one-electron QED eﬀects.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we developed a convenient numerical approach to the evaluation of two-loop

corrections in the mixed momentum-coordinate representation. The elaborated scheme was

applied to the evaluation of a part of the two-loop self-energy correction which was omitted

in the previous study [7]. It is worth mentioning that our numerical procedure is relatively

cheap from computational point of view, as compared to [7]. While in that work the total

computational time of about 7000 h was reported for a given value of Z, our evaluation

requires only 100-150 h on a Pentium-like computer for one value of Z.

The results of our calculation combined with those of [7] yield the total value for the

two-loop self-energy correction of −1.874(11) eV for the ground state of H-like uranium and

of −1.119(11) eV for bismuth. As this correction has been the last uncalculated second-

order QED contribution in these systems up to now, our calculation improves signiﬁcantly

the accuracy of the theoretical prediction in one-electron ions. The total result for the

ground-state Lamb shift in H-like uranium amounts to 463.93(50) eV. While the present

experimental precision of ±13 eV [1] is not high enough to test the second-order QED

eﬀects, it is going to be improved by an order of magnitude in the near future [1].

The evaluation of the two-loop self-energy correction for the 1s state allows us to make

an estimate of this contribution for the 2p1/2-2s transition energy in Li-like ions. This is of

particular importance, since in that case the experimental accuracy is much better than for

H-like ions, which makes Li-like ions very promising for testing second-order QED eﬀects.

The ﬁrst estimate of the two-loop self-energy correction allows us to ascribe a well-deﬁned

uncertainty to the theoretical prediction. For the 2p1/2-2s transition in Li-like uranium, the

total result amounts to 280.64(24) eV, which should be compared with the experimental

value of 280.59(10) eV [34].

multiplied by a divergent constant of order 1/ǫ. However, in our present evaluation of the

APPENDIX B: ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF THE ONE-LOOP SELF-ENERGY

OPERATOR

In this section we consider analytical properties of the one-loop self-energy operator

Σ(0)(εa − ω, p) as a function of ω. From the deﬁnition (A1), one can deduce that the

self-energy operator can be represented by a combination of two basic integrals,

Σ(0)(εa − ω) as functions of real ω can be analytically continued both into the upper and

into the lower half-plane. However, for ω > ω0

+ the self-energy operator allows the analytical

continuation in the upper half-plane only, and for ω < −ω0

− in the lower half-plane only. We

can conclude that Σ(0)(εa − ω) is an analytic function of ω in the complex plane with the

branch cuts [m + εa − i0, ∞ − i0) and [−m + εa + i0, −∞ + i0).

APPENDIX C: ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF THE VERTEX OPERATOR

Here we are interested in analytical properties of the vertex operator Γσ(p1, p2) as a

function of ω in two kinematics: a) p1 = (εa − ω, p1), p2 = (εa − ω, p2); and b) p1 =

(εa − ω, p1), p2 = (εa, p2).

combination of three basic integrals,

From the deﬁnition (A5), we can deduce that the vertex operator can be written as a

Introducing the Feynman parametrization of the denominator and shifting the integration

variable k → k − yq − xp2, we obtain

(C2)

where q = p1 −p2, ˜m2 = m2 −i0, and the identity (B4) has been taken into account. Shifting

the integration variable y → xy yields

its roots. In kinematics “a”, we have:

Obviously, the denominator N is a quadratic polynomial with respect to ω. Let us ﬁnd

N = −(1 − x)(εa − ω)2 + ˜m2 + B2 ,

where B2 = xy(1 − y)q2 + (1 − x)yp2

1 + (1 − x)(1 − y)p2

2, B2 ≥ 0. We write N as

N = (1 − x)(ω+ − ω − i0)(ω− + ω − i0) ,

ω± =

m2 + B2
1 − x

s

± εa .

As can easily be seen, ω± ≥ ω0

± = m ± εa.

In kinematics “b”, we have analogously,

where

N = y(1 − xy)(ω+ − ω − i0)(ω− + ω − i0) ,

ω± =

)

(C12)

Again, one can show that ω± ≥ ω0

± = m ± εa.

So, we ﬁnd that Γσ(εa − ω, εa − ω) and Γσ(εa − ω, εa) are analytic functions of ω in the

complex plane with the branch cuts [m + εa − i0, ∞ − i0) and [−m + εa + i0, −∞ + i0).

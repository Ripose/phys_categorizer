We demonstrate high resolution coherent control of cold atomic Rubidium utilizing spectral phase
manipulation of a femtosecond optical frequency comb. Transient coherent accumulation is directly
manifested by the enhancement of signal amplitude and spectral resolution via the pulse number.
The combination of frequency comb technology and spectral phase manipulation enables coherent
control techniques to enter a new regime with natural linewidth resolutions.

The introduction of phase-stabilized optical frequency
combs has revolutionized the ﬁeld of precision atomic
and molecular spectroscopy [1, 2]. In our previous work
we used direct frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) to
demonstrate high resolution measurements of one- and
two-photon transitions in cold 87Rb [3, 4]. This new
technique has the signiﬁcant advantage that the comb
frequencies may be absolutely referenced, for example to
a Cesium atomic clock, enabling precision spectroscopy
over a bandwidth of several tens of nanometers. The
time-domain phase coherence oﬀered by the optical fre-
quency comb has stimulated research in areas of atomic
clocks [5, 6], optical and radio frequency transfer [7], and
more recently high harmonic generation [8, 9]. In par-
allel, the ﬁeld of coherent control of atomic and molecu-
lar systems has seen advances incorporating high power
femtosecond laser sources and pulse shaping technol-
ogy. This has allowed for demonstrations of robust co-
herent population transfer via adiabatic passage tech-
niques [10, 11], coherent control of two-photon absorp-
tion [12, 13, 14], resolution enhancement of coherent
anti-Raman scattering [15], and progress towards cold
atom photoassociation [16]. It is under this exciting con-
text that we combine the femtosecond comb and spectral
phase manipulation with the aim towards coherent con-
trol at the highest possible spectroscopic resolution.

In this Letter, properties of the transient coherent ac-
cumulation eﬀect, including spectral phase manipulation,
are explicitly demonstrated via a ﬁnite number of phase-
stabilized femtosecond pulses. Speciﬁcally, we measure
atomic transition linewidth and population transfer ver-
sus the number of applied phase-coherent femtosecond
pulses and as a function of linear frequency chirp. The
basic idea of multi-pulse coherent accumulation is that
the amplitude for excitation of a speciﬁc atomic energy
level may be increased signiﬁcantly with the number of
femtosecond pulses, and can be done such that other
non-resonant states remain unexcited, thus enabling high
state selectivity. We show that tuning the comb leads
to destructive quantum interference of the two-photon
transition amplitude only observable in this multi-pulse
context and may be useful for eliminating nonlinear ab-
sorption. Positive and negative linear frequency chirp is

then applied to the comb modes and thus the two-photon
transition amplitudes. It is shown that the role of chirp in
the single pulse case is no longer necessarily applicable in
these multi-pulse experiments since the atomic coherence
persists between femtosecond pulses. The combination of
pulse shaping with the femtosecond comb is shown to in-
crease the signal of a two-photon transition at a speciﬁc
chirp while maintaining high resolution.

The spectrum of a train of femtosecond pulses is a set
of approximately 106 comb modes equally spaced by the
repetition frequency (fr) of the mode-locked laser. The
frequency of each comb mode is given by the relation
νN = fo + N × fr, where fo is the carrier-envelope oﬀset
frequency and N is an integer mode number of the order
106 [2]. The frequencies of the comb modes are indepen-
dent of the spectral phase provided all pulses in the train
have the same spectral phase. For the two-photon tran-
sitions we investigate, there are of the order 2N diﬀer-
ent transition amplitudes from the ground to the excited
state. It is instructive to consider the frequency spectrum
of the laser ﬁeld consisting of a ﬁnite number of pulses. In
this work we use from one to approximately 100 pulses
for atomic excitation. The linewidth of the laser ﬁeld
after a single pulse is approximately 30 nm, and after
two pulses the spectrum is sinusoidally modulated with
a spacing of fr between peaks. In general, a comb mode
lineshape is described by a sinc2 function of the pulse
number. As the linewidth narrows, the peak power of any
comb mode grows as the number of pulses squared. This
amplitude and spectral resolution enhancement presents
a clear distinction from previous experiments employing
single pulse excitation.

To explore the transient coherent accumulation eﬀects,
we use a sample of 87Rb atoms laser cooled and trapped
in a magneto-optic trap (MOT). This allows for approx-
imately 50 pulses to coherently interact with the atomic
system via the 5S1/2 F=2 to 5P3/2 F=3 to 5D5/2 F=4
two-photon transition (Fig. 1(a)). We use a Kerr lens
mode locked Ti:Sapphire laser which operates at a cen-
ter wavelength of 778 nm with a 30 nm wide spectrum
and 100 MHz repetition rate. This produces transform
limited pulses of approximately 40 fs duration. fo is mea-
sured via the typical f -2f interferometer technique and

model is a good approximation to our experiment after
several pulses. However, for excitation by less than a
few pulses the other hyperﬁne states can not necessarily
be considered oﬀ-resonance because the frequency comb
structure of the ﬁeld is not manifest.

The data acquisition cycle (Fig. 1(b)) consists of load-
ing the MOT, shutting oﬀ all MOT-related ﬁelds, then
exciting the free cold atoms. A pockels cell with 8 ns
rise time is used as a fast shutter to transmit any de-
sired number of pulses to the atoms. The triggering for
the pockels cell is directly from the laser repetition fre-
quency to ensure that the pockels cell is always fully on
or oﬀ when a femtosecond pulse is incident. Tunable lin-
ear frequency chirp is generated by a double pass grating
stretcher and compressor which allows for chirp up to
φ′′ = ± 2.5×105f s2, deﬁned as φ′′ = dφ2/dω2. Some
higher order dispersion is present, but our data is gen-
erally well modeled by the inclusion of only quadratic
spectral phase. The MOT is loaded for 6 ms, then the
magnetic ﬁeld is turned oﬀ for 3 ms during which time
an optical molasses remains, ﬁnally the atoms are probed
after all other ﬁelds are oﬀ. The timing diagram in (Fig.
1(b)) shows the atoms are excited by M pulses, spon-
taneously emitted photons are counted for 5 µs as the
atoms relax, then repeated 40 times per MOT.

We ﬁrst demonstrate the coherent accumulation of a
controlled number of femtosecond pulses on the 5D5/2
F=4 population and lineshape. Previous work on DFCS
[3, 4] was conducted only under steady state atomic ex-
citation, i.e. excitation times longer than the atomic co-
herence time. This is necessary for spectroscopy with the
highest possible resolution, but we investigate properties
of the transient femtosecond coherent accumulation for
pulse numbers, or equivalently excitation times signiﬁ-
cantly less than the 240 ns 5D5/2 F=4 atomic lifetime.
The fr and fo of the comb are tuned to 100.41356730
MHz and 18.14 MHz respectively, which ensure that a
comb mode is resonant with the 5S1/2 F=2 to 5P3/2
F=3 one-photon transition and another with the 5P3/2
F=3 to 5D5/2 F=4 transition (Fig. 2 inset). We split
the probe laser and counter-propagate the two intensity-
matched beams through the atoms to balance the ra-
diation pressure and thus minimize any line broaden-
ing due to accumulated Doppler shifts. For the chirped
excitation experiments described later the laser is not
counter-propagated. The femtosecond probe laser is fo-
cused with linear polarization to a diameter of 160 µm
into the MOT, resulting in an electric ﬁeld strength per
beam of approximately 107 V/m. Figure 2 shows the to-
tal number of photon counts (in squares) that occur after
the M th pulse and is a measure proportional to the total
5D population after excitation by M pulses. The dashed

at a smaller number of pulses than in the case of weak

locked to a stable radio frequency (rf) source which is
ﬁxed at a prescribed value or scanned. fr is stabilized via
a Cs-referenced low phase-noise rf source and steered so
as to maintain the appropriate absolute frequency of the
comb modes. In the following experiments, fr is locked
to 100.41356730 MHz, which for fo values of either 18.14
MHz or -31.86 MHz ensures two-photon resonance be-
tween the 5S1/2 F=2 ground state and 5D5/2 F=4. For
fo = 18.14 MHz, there is a comb mode resonant with the
intermediate state 5P3/2 F=3. In the other case of fo =
-31.86 MHz, no mode is resonant with 5P3/2 F=3, but
rather all modes are symmetrically detuned around this
intermediate resonance. The signal is proportional to the
5D population and is measured by photon counting the
420 nm 5D-6P-5S cascade ﬂuorescence. For appropri-
ately chosen values of fr and fo, the signal after a suf-
ﬁcient number of pulses to reach steady state excitation
can be attributed to only this 5D5/2 F=4 resonant hy-
perﬁne level [3]. After many pulses all other 5D and 7S
hyperﬁne states, although covered by the 30 nm comb
spectrum, are detuned many linewidths away from the
closest comb modes and as a result remain unexcited.

The theory model describing the experimental results
is based on numerical solution of the Liouville equation
for the density matrix of the three level atomic system.
Decoherence of the electronic system is included via phe-
nomenological decay terms due to the natural linewidth
of 6 MHz for the 5P and 660 kHz for the 5D atomic
states. The driving ﬁeld is taken to be a linearly chirped
pulse of 30 nm bandwidth at 778 nm and a transform
limited peak ﬁeld strength of Eo = 107 V/m. The so-
lution of the Liouville equation is stepped through time
via a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. After numer-
ical solution for a single pulse, the density matrix is ad-
vanced in time by approximately 1/fr to the next pulse
analytically, then repeated for an arbitrary number of
pulses. This technique diﬀers from some previous work
on modeling two-photon coherent control with femtosec-
ond pulses as it includes eﬀects of atomic decoherence
and the impulsive excitation approximation is not used
[14, 17]. Our model includes only the 5S1/2 F=2, 5P3/2
F=3, 5D5/2 F=4 hyperﬁne levels. Because the comb is
tuned on resonance with this transition, the three-level

[10, 11]) and large negative chirps, this can be under-
stood conceptually as the front of the pulse is only res-
onant with the 5P to 5D transition. Due to the fact
that there is no initial population in 5P a resonantly en-
hanced two-photon transition can not occur, the only
contribution can be from the frequencies corresponding
to approximately half the 5S-5D energy splitting. Simi-
lar to previous experiments with single pulse excitation
we observe a characteristic oscillation of 5D population

the deﬁnition of δ is given in Fig. 1(a). The measured
period of φ′′
2π = 14.5×104 f s2 agrees well with the theory
value of φ′′
2π = 14.3×104 f s2 for 5P3/2 F=3. However,
for negative chirps signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results are ob-
served for multi-pulse excitation as shown in Fig. 4. This
diﬀerence is due to the 5S-5P electronic coherence that

of power broadening of the transition linewidth due to
the femtosecond probe laser. For pulse numbers signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than the 5D coherence time the population
scaling can be ﬁt well by a second order polynomial in
the pulse number or equivalently the accumulated area
(inset Fig. 2). This coherent enhancement of the pop-
ulation versus pulse number demonstrates the increased
eﬃciency compared to excitation by a single pulse of the
same total power for the case of two-photon absorption
via a resonant intermediate state.

the lineshape is measured by scanning fo after excita-
tion from M pulses to directly demonstrate the reso-
lution enhancement. As was mentioned previously the
spectral content of the ﬁeld generated by a ﬁnite number
of pulses is a series of modes each with a linewidth in-
versely proportional to the number of pulses coherently
accumulated. Figure 3 illustrates this eﬀect through the
lineshape and width of the measured 5D5/2 F=4 reso-
nance after excitation by 10, 15, 20, and 80 pulses. The
asymptotic power broadened linewidth of 2 MHz occurs
at 80 pulses which is approximately the number of pulses
the 5D5/2 F=4 population in Fig. 2 becomes saturated.
Some of the original work on coherent control has
demonstrated the modiﬁcation of the quantum interfer-
ence of the two-photon transition in Rb and Cs by shap-
ing a single ampliﬁed femtosecond pulse [12, 13, 14]. It
was shown that for the transition from 5S to 5D in Rb
the excited state population was essentially zero for large
negative chirp, where higher frequencies precede lower
(see the single pulse theory in Fig. 4). For low ﬁeld
strengths (in the absence of adiabatic following eﬀects

tude for a pair of modes is a function of the intermediate
state detuning [18]. The detuning of the closest mode
to the intermediate 5P3/2 F=3 state can be tuned from
0 MHz to at most fr/2. In the case of all modes sym-
metrically detuned around 5P3/2 F=3, the relative phase
between the ± 50 MHz detuned two-photon transition
amplitudes is 2 × tan−1 (2×(50 MHz/6 MHz)) ≃ 1730,
between all other further detuned mode pairs it is ≃ 1800.
This phase ﬂip around the intermediate state results in
nearly complete destructive quantum interference of the
two-photon transition probability for transform limited
pulses [12]. Translating the entire comb by varying fo
can easily position all mode pairs symmetrically around
the intermediate state, while maintaining two photon res-
onance (Fig. 5, inset). As shown in Fig. 5, this results
in approximately 50 times less 5D population than the
previous case when a mode is tuned on 5P3/2 F=3 res-
onance. Linear frequency chirp introduces extra relative
phase between amplitudes detuned above and below the
5P resonance and reduces the net destructive interfer-
ence. As shown in Fig. 5, the two-photon transition
probability is modulated versus chirp, with a minimum
5D population at zero chirp.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated transient co-
herent accumulation via a controlled number of phase-
coherent femtosecond pulses in an atomic system. The
application of spectral phase manipulation to this multi-
pulse regime enables fundamental coherent control ex-
periments to be performed at a resolution limited only
by natural resonance widths. The present work is a step
towards combining pulse shaping from the ﬁeld of co-
herent control with femtosecond comb technology. This
research is expected to enable high resolution coherent
control, for example, in wavepacket shaping for molecu-
lar photo-association [19].

persists for approximately 50 ns, or about ﬁve inter-pulse
periods. For negative-chirp pulses the intermediate state
can be excited by the low frequency end of the preced-
ing pulse and the high frequency beginning of the next
pulse can complete the two-photon transition. Figure 4
inset shows the 5D population at φ′′ = ± 6.7×104 f s2
versus the number of pulses to illustrate that the scaling
of 5D population is smaller for negative chirp. We em-
phasize that unlike single pulse experiments our results
involve only three well resolved hyperﬁne levels chosen
such that hyperﬁne selection rules prohibit any transi-
tions from other states to 5D5/2 F=4. It is for this reason
that we may be attribute the measured oscillation period,
φ′′
2π, to only one intermediate state. This contrasts previ-
ous work where the 5P1/2 states exhibit a shorter period,
φ′′
2π = 2.38×103 f s2, oscillation superposed on the larger
5P3/2 signal [11, 14].

Our ﬁnal experiment further demonstrates the versa-
tility of the high resolution frequency comb with spectral
phase control by signiﬁcantly reducing the nonlinear ab-
sorption. The phase of the two-photon transition ampli-

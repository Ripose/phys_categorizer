Quantum scattering problem without partial-wave analysis

Vladimir S. Melezhik

We have suggested a method for treating different quantum few-body dynamics without
usual partial-wave analysis. With this approach new results were obtained in the physics of
ultracold atom-atom collisions and ionization and excitation/deexitation of helium ions. The
developed computational scheme opens new possibilities for analysis the actual problem of
ultracold atom wave-packets collisions in strong laser or magnetic conﬁnement.

INTRODUCTION

In our papers [1, 2] an alternative approach to the conventional partial-wave analysis was
suggested to represent the few-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation on the basis constructed from
the eigenfunctions of the angular momentum square operator deﬁned on the angular grid in the
spirit of the discrete variable representation (DVR) [3] or the Lagrange-mesh method [4].

To construct the basis orthogonal on the angular grid for one angular variable is a solvable
problem if to chose the grid points coinciding with the nodes of the Gauss quadrature. Differ-
ent kinds of the one-dimensional DVR or Lagrange-meshes are broadly applied for quantum
computations[3, 4] due to the simplicity and efﬁciency of this approach. However, an extension
of this representation to the two-dimensional case (two angles q and f of the unit sphere) is a
nontrivial problem. Actually, the simple idea to construct the two-dimensional DVR as a di-
rect product of two one-dimensional DVRs leads to essential complication of the matrix of the
angular part of the kinetic energy operator. As a result, the advantages of the one-dimensional
DVR, its simplicity and efﬁciency, are loosing [3]. Another way to construct two-dimensional
DVR on an unit sphere is to use the spherical harmonics deﬁned on the two-dimensional grid.
However, at that it becomes not possible to satisfy the orthogonality conditions for all the el-
ements of the ﬁxed set of this basis on the chosen grid. To overcome this difﬁculty we have
suggested [5, 9] to use the basis of the orthogonalyzed combinations of the spherical harmon-
ics on the two-dimensional grid over q and f variables. It happened that this idea was very
efﬁcient for the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation with three nonseparable spatial variables
[5]. Particularly, it has permitted to get with this approach a few important results in problems
of the atomic interaction with strong external electric and magnetic ﬁelds[2, 5, 6], the Coulomb
breakup of halo nuclei [7–9].

Recently, we have extended this method to the problem of the stripping and excitation of
helium ions by protons[10] and antiprotons. We also analysed for the ﬁrst time the three-
dimensional anisotropic scattering in the problem of ultracold atom-atom collisions in a laser
ﬁeld [11, 12].

II. BREAKUP PROCESSES AND ULTRACOLD COLLISIONS

A.

Ionization and excitation/deexcitation of helium ions in slow collisions with antiprotons

Experimental investigation of the collisions for slow antiprotons (p) with hydrogen and he-
lium becomes an actual problem for antiproton physics. It provides a strong challenge to the-

2

ory. Actually, there has been done a large number of theoretical studies of the p-H and p-He+
recently. However, more or less convergent results were obtained only for ionization in the
collisions p-H(1s) and p-He+(1s) from the ground states (where there is an agreement within
about 20% between the existing calculations) and also some attempts were done for p-He+(2s)
(see [13] and Refs. therein).

We have obtained new theoretical results for ionization and excitation/deexcitation processes
in slow collisions (100 keV ≥ Ep ≥ 0.1 keV) of p with H and He+ (some of them are given
in the Table I). Particularly, we have calculated for the ﬁrst time the cross sections from the
initial states with all possible (li, mi) 6= 0 to all possible excitations up to n f =10. The devel-
oped quantum time-dependent approach based on our ideas suggested in [5, 10] opens, thanks
to its efﬁciency and ﬂexibility, unique possibilities for treating different cascade processes in
antiproton physics.

B. Anisotropy effects in control of ultracold atom-atom collisions by laser ﬁelds

Possible controlling the atom-atom interaction of quantum gases is an important problem of
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at ultralow temperatures. Applying for that near resonant
lasers, radio frequency ﬁelds, Feschbach resonances induced by a magnetic ﬁeld, and static
electric ﬁelds are broadly discussed [14]. We have suggested an alternative possibility: to use a
nonresonant laser ﬁeld [11]. Including into consideration the ﬁniteness of the laser wavelength
l L or the alteration of the laser polarization makes the problem of the atom-atom collisions in
the laser ﬁeld nonseparable over both angular variables q and f
(scattering angles). It leads to
essentially anisotropic scattering and has demanded to extend our scheme for a nonseparable
three-dimensional stationary scattering problem [11].

With this approach we have found considerable inﬂuence of a nonresonant optical laser of
intensity I ≥ 105W /cm2 on the Cs-Cs ultracold collisions. In such ﬁeld the scattering becomes

3

strongly anisotropic even in the region of ulralow colliding energies where the s-wave dominates
at I = 0. I.e. the usual scattering length approach f (k, bki, bkf) = −a0 does not work and one has
to analyze the stability of BEC for unusual behavior of the amplitude f (k, bki, bkf) = f ( bki, bkf) at
k → 0. At that the amplitude may be strongly dependent on the l L, on the relative atom-atom
orientation with respect to the ﬁeld bki and on the scattering angle bkf [12].

The developed computational scheme opens new possibilities for study the actual problem
of few-dimensional wave-packets collisions in the strong conﬁnement induced by laser or mag-
netic traps.

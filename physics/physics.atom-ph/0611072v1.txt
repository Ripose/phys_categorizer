We present an experimental and theoretical investigation of the polarizabilities and hyperﬁne
constants of DJ states in 133Cs for J = 3/2 and J = 5/2. New experimental values for the hyperﬁne
constant A are obtained from level-crossing signals of the (7,9,10)D5/2 states of 133Cs and precise
calculations of the tensor polarizabilities α2. The results of relativistic many-body calculations for
scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the (5-10)D3/2 and (5-10)D5/2 states are presented and compared
with measured values from the literature. Calculated values of the hyperﬁne constants A for these
states are also presented and checked for consistency with experimental values.

INTRODUCTION

Level-crossing spectroscopy in an electric ﬁeld has been
shown to be a useful technique to determine atomic prop-
erties. Already the ﬁrst experimental studies of reso-
nant signals at pure electric ﬁeld crossings of magnetic
±mF components of certain hyperﬁne (hfs) atomic lev-
els F at nonzero electric ﬁeld [1, 2, 3] and their further
development by applying two-step laser excitation [4]
demonstrated how this technique could be used to ob-
tain atomic properties. The method makes use of the
fact that the electric ﬁeld values at which magnetic sub-
levels mF cross in an electric ﬁeld depend on the tensor
polarizability α2 and on the hfs constants. When the
electric ﬁeld is scanned and laser induced ﬂuorescence
(LIF) of deﬁnite polarization is observed, these cross-
ings are associated with resonance behavior in the LIF
signals. When the separation between crossings is large
compared to the widths of the resonance signals, as in the
nD3/2 states of the 133Cs atom (see Fig. 1a), they lead to
rather well-pronounced resonances in the observed ﬂuo-
rescence. Moreover, these resonances correspond exactly
to the level-crossing points under appropriate experimen-
tal conditions. Such resonances were used to measure the
tensor polarizabilities α2 in the 7, 9D3/2 states of 133Cs
atoms [4], in which the magnetic dipole coupling hfs con-
stant A had been previously measured with good pre-
cision, and the electric quadrupole hfs constant B was
assumed to be negligibly small [5].

Such measurements become more challenging, how-
ever, in the case of the nD5/2 states of cesium, since
there are many closely spaced crossing points of mag-
netic ±mF components (see Fig. 1,b-d). As a result,

the level-crossing signals overlap and no longer contain
discernable resonances. In this case, reliable values for
atomic properties can be extracted only by means of a
very detailed and accurate theoretical description of the
observed electric ﬁeld dependence of the signals as a func-
tion of atomic properties and experimental conditions.
Such theoretical descriptions have been developed and
tested in connection with the nD3/2 states [4]. Neverthe-
less, the level-crossing technique cannot be used at this
time to improve the knowledge of the tensor polarizabil-
ities α2 of the nD5/2 states because the extant measure-
ments of the hfs constant A contain uncertainties on the
order of 30%. The small hyperﬁne interaction, especially
for n > 7, makes them diﬃcult to measure [6, 7].

The ﬁrst value of the hfs constant A of the nD5/2
states of 133Cs was obtained with measurements of the
widths of optical double resonance (ODR) signals in
the Paschen-Back region. The results for the 9D5/2
and 10D5/2 states were −0.5(2) MHz and −0.4(2) MHz,
respectively [8]. These values were improved through
level-crossing spectroscopy in magnetic ﬁelds, yielding
−0.40(15) and −0.30(10) MHz [6]. The authors com-
bined these data with previous ODR measurements [7]
and presented the weighted average as −0.45(10) and
−0.35(10) MHz. They concluded that the quadrupole
interaction can be completely ignored when ﬁtting the
experimental data. For the 7D5/2 state, Bulos et al. es-
timated the A value to be −1.7(2) MHz from the ODR
signal width [9]. The drawback of the ODR experiments
on the 7,9,10D5/2 signals is that it is necessary to use in-
direct cascade transitions to observe the nD5/2 signals be-
cause of the presence of scattered light at the nD5/2 −→
6P3/2 ﬂuorescence transition [7, 9]

The tensor polarizabilities α2 for the nD5/2 states in
cesium under discussion are known with far greater preci-
sion. For the 10D5/2 state, α2 has been measured by Xia
and coworkers to a very high precision of about 0.3% at

6815(20) × 103 a.u. [10]. For the 9D5/2 state the α2 value
is measured with ca. 5% accuracy at 2650(140) × 103
a.u. by means of level crossing spectroscopy in combined
electric and magnetic ﬁelds [6, 11]. For the 7D5/2 state,
there exists a measured value of 129(4) × 103 a.u. pre-
sented in Ref. [12], which, however, should be veriﬁed,
because it diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the theoretical value
of 140 × 103 a.u. [13]. Furthermore, a more recent mea-
surement of α2 for the 7D3/2 state [4] was closer to the
theoretical estimate of [13] than the measurement of [12].
The situation with the electronic structure calculations
is similar to the experimental situation. Rather good ac-
curacy has been achieved for theoretical estimates of the
tensor polarizability α2, as can be seen from the fact that
the calculations of [13] for 133Cs agree with very accurate
experimental data for the (10-13)D3/2,5/2 states [10]. De-
spite this precision for the polarizability, the estimates of
the hfs constants are poor and can hardly be evaluated
reliably, for reasons that will be discussed below. There-
fore, there is a need for more accurate values for the hfs
constants of the nD5/2 states.

In order to determine the hfs constants A from our
measurements of mF sublevel crossing signals in the
7,9,10D5/2 states of cesium, we used the following ap-
proach. We ﬁt the measured signals with calculated
curves derived from simulations, which had been devel-
oped and tested in [4]. With the tensor polarizability α2
ﬁxed, these ﬁts yielded the hfs constant A. To choose the
proper value for α2, we performed an all-order relativistic
many-body calculation.

Section II contains a description of the experiment, fol-
lowed by a discussion of the simulations used to describe
the measured signals. The all-order relativistic many-
body calculations that provided the values for the tensor
polarizabilities α2 are described in section III, and the
values for α2 obtained from these calculations are com-
pared with earlier experimentally measured values.
In
section IV we discuss the application of these calcula-
tions to estimating the hfs constants and compare them
to the results of previous experiments. In section V we
show how to use our experimental results from section II
and the calculated tensor polarizabilities from section III
to estimate new values for the hfs constant A.

II. EXPERIMENT AND DESCRIPTION OF
SIGNALS

A. Method

The premise of level crossing spectroscopy is that the
spatial intensity distribution and polarization of the laser
induced ﬂuorescence produced when an atom is excited
depends on the coherences between diﬀerent magnetic
sublevels mF of hyperﬁne levels F . Such coherences are
destroyed when the degeneracy between diﬀerent sub-
levels is broken in an electric ﬁeld. However, in the case of
linear polarization, they can be restored when sublevels

2

with ∆mF = ±2 cross at certain electric ﬁeld values.
Figure 1 shows the hyperﬁne level-splitting diagram in
an external electric ﬁeld for the 7D3/2 and 7D5/2 states
of cesium. This diagram is calculated by diagonalizing
the Hamiltonian, which includes the hyperﬁne and Stark
interactions, in an uncoupled basis [14].

When applying the method of level crossing spec-
troscopy to the study of the nD5/2 states of cesium,
one encounters two diﬃculties not present in the case
of the nD3/2 states. The ﬁrst diﬃculty is that the nD5/2
hyperﬁne manifold contains seven level crossings with
∆mF = ±2, whereas the nD3/2 manifold contains only
two (see Fig. 1). The large number of level crossings in
the nD5/2 state wash out the sharp resonances that could
be observed in the nD3/2 state.

The second diﬃculty is that in the case of the nD5/2
states, after the two-step excitation 6S1/2 −→ 6P3/2
−→ nD5/2 (see Fig. 2), it is necessary to observe the
ﬂuorescence from the nD5/2 −→ 6P3/2 transition. Thus,
scattered light from the exciting laser constitutes a high
background that must be suppressed. Figure 2 shows the
level excitation scheme.

B. Experimental details

We studied cesium vapor at room temperature in a
glass cell. The experimental setup is essentially the same
as in Ref. [4]. We could apply an electric ﬁeld between
two transparent electrodes inside the cell, which were sep-
arated by a 2.5 mm gap. Figure 3 shows a schematic
diagram of the experimental setup and geometry. The
most crucial detail of the experiment is the relative ori-
entation of the electric ﬁeld and the polarization vectors
of the linearly polarized laser radiation. The ﬁrst laser,
which excited the 6S1/2 −→ 6P3/2 transition, was polar-
ized with its polarization vector E1 parallel to the dc elec-
tric ﬁeld E, which was along the z-axis. The second laser,
which excited the 6P3/2 −→ 7,9,10D5/2 transition, was
sent in a counter propagating direction and was polarized
perpendicular to the ﬁrst, with polarization vector E2
parallel to the y-axis. We observed the laser induced ﬂu-
orescence (LIF) at the nD5/2 −→ 6P3/2 transition along
the z-axis through the transparent electrodes. A linear
polarizer selected the intensities of the LIF polarization
components along the x or y-axes Ix or Iy. Since the LIF
was observed at the same frequency at which the second
laser was operating, it was necessary to suppress care-
fully the scattered light by means of diaphragms. The
scattered light accounted for between 30% and 50% of
the measured signal. We checked that this background
remained stable during the measurements and subtracted
it from the signals. The LIF passed through an MDR-3
monochromator with 2.6 nm/mm inverse dispersion and
was recorded with a PMT in photon counting mode dur-
ing one second time intervals.

The ﬁrst laser was always a diode laser (based on an
LD-0850-100sm laser diode) and was tuned to excite the

62P3/2 state from the F = 3 hfs component of the ground
state. We chose to excite from the F = 3 level, because
in this way we could avoid the F = 6 level of the nD5/2
ﬁnal state. The F = 6 level contained no level crossings
and thus would contribute only background. We took
advantage of a sideband of the radiation of the ﬁrst laser
in order to achieve broadband excitation.

For the second excitation step, we used a diode laser
(based on a Hitachi HL6738MG laser diode) in the case of
the 7D5/2 state and a CR699-21 ring dye laser with Rho-
damine 6G dye in the case of the 9D5/2 and 10D5/2 states.
The second laser was operated in single mode regime.
We recorded data at diﬀerent values of the detuning of
the second laser in order to compare the results obtained
at diﬀerent detunings with simulations. A HighFinesse
WS/6 wavemeter allowed us to measure changes in the
lasers’ detuning with a resolution of 30 MHz. However,
in general we operated at the detuning that maximized
the ﬂuorescence signal. When the second laser was the
diode laser, we jittered its output frequency over a range
of approximately 1.2 GHz by applying a sawtooth wave
with a frequency of tens of Hertz to a piezoelectric crys-
tal mounted to its feedback grating. The laser power was
of the order of a few mW, and the laser beam diameters
were approximately 1 mm.

The electric ﬁeld produced in the cell was cali-
brated with measurements of level-crossing signals for the
10D3/2 state of cesium as in [4]. The level-crossing res-
onance positions obtained with our cell were compared
with the crossing points calculated from the tensor polar-
izability of [10] and the hfs constant A of [5]. The overall
uncertainty on the electric ﬁeld magnitude was estimated
to be about 1%.

As can be seen from Figures 4, 5, and 6 there are no
well-deﬁned level crossing resonances. Nevertheless, a
curve with multiple features is obtained, and these fea-
tures can be ﬁtted with the results of a simulation based
on a theoretical model. This simulation is described in
the following subsection. The ﬁt involves adjusting the
hyperﬁne constant A and those experimental parameters
that we could not measure absolutely, such as the laser
detuning. We ﬁx the tensor polarizability α2 at the val-
ues that are obtained from the calculations described in
section III.

D. Signal description

Since well-deﬁned resonances are no longer present in
the signals of the D5/2 states, the data can be interpreted
only by means of simulations based on a detailed model.
Such a model was elaborated in detail and veriﬁed in
a previous publication [4], so we will only outline the
approach in what follows.

The model describes atoms that interact simultane-
ously with radiation produced by two lasers with rela-
tively broad spectral proﬁles, which were necessary to
excite coherently magnetic sublevels that are split by an
external electric ﬁeld E (see Fig. 1). The model assumes
that the atoms move classically and are excited at the
internal transitions. Thus, the internal atomic dynamics
can be described by a semiclassical atomic density ma-
trix ρ, which also depends on the classical coordinates of
the atomic center of mass.

The ground state of the Cs atom consists of two hy-
perﬁne levels with total angular momentum Fg = 3 and
Fg = 4, each containing 2Fg + 1 magnetic sublevels. The
ﬁrst laser excites the atoms from the ground state to the
6P3/2 state, which contains hyperﬁne levels Fe = 2, 3, 4,
and 5. The second laser excites the atom from the 6P3/2
state to the nD5/2 state, which contained hyperﬁne levels
Ff = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The external electric ﬁeld E partially decouples the
electronic angular momentum from the nuclear spin,
which implies that the magnetic sublevel energies no
longer depend quadratically on the electric ﬁeld (see
Fig. 1). In order to obtain the real dependence on the
electric ﬁeld, it is necessary to diagonalize the full Hamil-
It is also necessary to take into consider-
ton matrix.
ation that the decoupling of angular momentum from
nuclear spin alters the dipole transition probabilities be-
tween magnetic sublevels.

The entire model is based on the Optical Bloch Equa-
tions (OBEs) for the density matrix ρ (see, for example,
[15])

The equations can be simpliﬁed by assuming that each
laser excites only the transition to which it is tuned. We
also apply the rotating wave approximation for multi-
level systems [16] to the OBEs. The resulting stochastic
diﬀerential equations can be further simpliﬁed by using
the decorrelation approach [17]. The stochasticity derives

5

from the random ﬂuctuations of the laser radiation with
ﬁnite spectral width. This approach assumes that both
lasers are uncorrelated and that the integration time for
each measurement is large compared to the character-
istic phase-ﬂuctuation time of the exciting light source.
The decorrelation approximation amounts to solving the
equations of the density matrix elements that correspond
to optical coherences and taking a formal statistical av-
erage over the ﬂuctuating phases [18]. This procedure
results in a system of equations that, when solved, yields
the observed signals.

From the density matrix of the ﬁnal state, one can
obtain the ﬂuorescence intensities of a given polarization

III. CALCULATION OF SCALAR AND
TENSOR POLARIZABILITIES

A. Motivation

The description of the signals obtained from the exper-
iment described above depends on two atomic properties
simultaneously: the hyperﬁne constant A and the tensor
polarizability α2. If one of these constants can be known
by independent means, the experiment provides a way
to determine the other. In this section, we describe an
all-order relativistic many-body calculation of the tensor
polarizability α2. A reliable theoretical estimate of this
constant, together with the experimental results of the
previous section, can be used to estimate the hyperﬁne
constant A, which is diﬃcult to calculate theoretically
and has not been measured to high precision for the 7,9,
and 10D5/2 states of cesium.

B. Method

The scalar α0 and tensor α2 polarizabilities of an atomic
state v are calculated using formulas

where D is the dipole operator and the formula for α0
includes only the valence part of the polarizability. The
contribution to α0 from the ionic core is negligible for the
present calculation (16 a3
0). The sum over n includes the
nP1/2, nP3/2, and nF5/2 states for the calculation of the
D3/2 polarizabilities in cesium and the nP3/2, nF5/2, and
nF7/2 states for the calculation of the D5/2 polarizabil-
ities. The sum over the intermediate states n converges
rather quickly and only the ﬁrst few terms need to be
calculated accurately. Therefore, we separate the calcu-
lation of the polarizabilities into the calculation of the
main term αmain and the evaluation of the remainder
αtail. We include the contributions from the following
states into the main term: 6P , 7P , 8P , 9P , 10P , 11P ,
12P , 4F , 5F , 6F , 7F , and 8F to calculate the polar-
izabilities of all D states considered in this paper. We
also include the contributions from the 9F states into
the calculation of the αmain(10D). All electric-dipole re-
duced matrix elements in Eqs. (3, 4) that are needed for
the calculation of the main term are calculated using the
relativistic all-order method, which is brieﬂy described
below. We use experimental energies from [22] in the
main term calculations. We note that the polarizabilities
of the 9D and 10D states are very sensitive to the val-
ues of the 9D − 10P and 10D − 11P energy diﬀerences,
respectively, since they are small (50 − 100 cm−1). We
assume that the energies in Ref. [22] are accurate to all
quoted digits. The remainders αtail are small for all sums
and are calculated in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) ap-
proximation.

The all-order method used here sums inﬁnite sets of
many-body perturbation theory terms. We refer the
reader to Refs. [23, 24, 25] for a detailed description of
the approach. Brieﬂy, the wave function of the valence
electron v is represented as an expansion

where Φv is the lowest-order atomic state function, which
is taken to be the frozen-core Dirac-Hartree-Fock wave
function of a state v. This lowest-order atomic state
function can be written as |Φvi = a†
v|0Ci, where |0Ci
represent DHF wave function of a closed core. The in-
dices m and n designate excited states and indices a and
b designate core states. The equations for the excitation
coeﬃcients are solved iteratively until the correlation en-
ergy converges to an acceptable accuracy. The excita-
tion coeﬃcients ρma, ρmv, ρmnab, and ρmnva are used to
calculate the matrix elements, which can be expressed
in the framework of the all-order method as linear or
quadratic functions of the excitation coeﬃcients. The
electric-dipole matrix elements as well as the hyperﬁne
constants are calculated using the same approach. The
expansion given by Eq. (5) is restricted to single and dou-

6

ble (SD) excitations leading to the omission of certain
fourth- and higher-order terms.

We use B-splines [26] to generate a complete set of
DHF basis orbitals for the all-order calculation. Here,
we use N = 70 splines for each angular momentum.
The basis orbitals are constrained to a cavity of radius
R = 220 a.u. The size of the cavity is taken to be large
enough to ﬁt all of the states needed for the calculation
of the main terms for all of the polarizabilities calculated
in this work. The calculation of the polarizabilities of the
9D and 10D states requires such a large cavity since we
need to be able to properly describe states up to 12P and
9F . This work required extensive study of the numerical
accuracy and stability of the calculations. We veriﬁed
that our basis set gives correct lowest-order (DHF) val-
ues for the energies of all relevant states and transition
matrix elements between these states. We have also ver-
iﬁed that our basis set correctly reproduces DHF values
of the hyperﬁne constants for all the nDJ states consid-
ered here. We ﬁnd that it is necessary to use 70 splines
to produce an accurate basis set. We also conducted an
all-order calculation with a smaller cavity (R = 90 a.u.)
that is appropriate for the calculation of the properties
of the low-lying states and found that the properties of
the low-lying states are accurately described by our large
R = 220 a.u., N = 70 basis set. Therefore, we con-
clude that numerically accurate results can be obtained
even for such highly-excited states as 12P with the use
of large basis sets.

C. Results

The contributions to the scalar and tensor polarizabil-
ities for the 7D3/2 state in cesium are listed in Table I.
We note that the calculation of the scalar and tensor
polarizability diﬀers only in the angular factor, and all
matrix elements and energies are the same. The corre-
sponding energy diﬀerences and the absolute values of the
lowest-order and ﬁnal all-order electric-dipole reduced
matrix elements are also listed. The energy diﬀerences
are given in cm−1. Electric-dipole matrix elements are
given in atomic units (ea0), and polarizabilities are given
in 103 a3
0, where a0 is the Bohr radius. The diﬀerence
between the lowest-order values and the all-order values
allows to evaluate the size of the correlation correction.
The accuracy of our calculation is generally higher when
the relative size of the correlation correction is smaller.
The contributions from all terms in αmain are listed
separately to identify the most important terms. The
remainder αtail is separated to αtail(nP1/2), αtail(nP3/2),
and αtail(nF5/2) for the study of the convergence of these
three sums.

We ﬁnd that three contributions,

from the 8P1/2,
8P3/2, and 5F5/2 states, are dominant. Another term
(4F5/2) gives a small but signiﬁcant contribution to the
tensor polarizability. Therefore, we conduct a more ac-
curate calculation of the relevant matrix elements and

evaluate their uncertainties. The study of the breakdown
of the correlation correction demonstrates that the main
contributions to these transitions come from the terms
containing only single valence excitation coeﬃcients ρmv
(see Eq. (5)). In such cases, it is possible to use a semi-
empirical scaling procedure such as is described, for ex-
ample, in Ref. [24] to estimate dominant classes of the
omitted higher-order corrections. The single excitation
coeﬃcients ρmv are multiplied by the ratio of the ex-
perimental and theoretical correlation energy, and the
calculation of the matrix elements is repeated using the
modiﬁed excitation coeﬃcients. The diﬀerence between
the ab initio and scaled SD all-order values for the par-
ticular matrix element is taken to be its uncertainty. The
relative uncertainty of the corresponding contribution to
polarizability is twice the relative uncertainty of the ma-
trix element. As we noted above, we assume that the
experimental energies are accurate to all digits quoted
in Ref. [22]. The uncertainties of the total polarizabil-
ity values are obtained by adding the uncertainties of the
individual terms in quadrature. The uncertainty in all re-
maining contributions is estimated to be insigniﬁcant in
comparison with the uncertainty of the dominant terms.
We observe signiﬁcant cancellations between the domi-
nant terms for both scalar and tensor polarizabilities of
the 7D3/2 state. However, the cancellation is more severe

for the scalar polarizability, where the contributions from
8P1/2 and 5F5/2 states are comparable in size but have
opposite signs. Therefore, we expect higher accuracy of
our tensor polarizability calculation in comparison with
the scalar one.

The contributions to scalar and tensor polarizabilities
for the 7D5/2 state in cesium are listed in Table II. The
table is structured in exactly the same way as the one for
the 7D3/2 state. We ﬁnd that the contribution from the
8P3/2 state is clearly dominant and the cancellation is
much less severe. For the tensor polarizability, the next
largest term, 5F7/2, is six times as small as the dominant
term. The accuracy of the matrix elements in the dom-
inant terms is similar for the 7D3/2 and 7D5/2 states.
Therefore, our calculation of the 7D5/2 polarizabilities
is expected to be more accurate than that of the 7D3/2
polarizabilities.

The contributions to scalar and tensor polarizabilities
for the 9DJ and 10DJ states in cesium are listed in Ta-
bles III and IV, respectively. The breakdown of the
polarizability contributions is similar to that of the 7D
polarizability calculations. We list only the dominant
contributions separately and group all of the other con-
tributions together in the rows labeled “Other”. The un-
certainty is evaluated using the method described above.

cancellation of diﬀerent terms becomes less signiﬁcant
resulting in smaller uncertainties of the polarizabilities
for the 9D and 10D states in comparison with the un-
certainties for the 7D states. Overall, the uncertainties
of our polarizability calculation are 0.5% − 2.3%.

0. The conversion factor from the
MHz/(kV/cm)2 units to 103 atomic units used in the
present work is 10−7h/(4πǫ0a3
0) = 4.01878, where h is
the Planck constant. The present values agree with the
experimental results for 7D3/2, 9D3/2, and 10D5/2 states
within the corresponding uncertainties. There is some
discrepancy with the accurate experimental value for the
10D3/2 state, but the discrepancy is only 1.5 of our es-
timated uncertainty. However, our values for the 7D5/2
and 9D5/2 states disagree signiﬁcantly with the experi-
mental values for these states. The calculations for the
7D5/2, 9D5/2, and 10D5/2 state polarizabilities are very
similar. Thus, the experimental values for the scalar po-
larizabilities are not consistent with each other accord-
ing to our theoretical model. Our calculations conﬁrm
the value for the 10D5/2 state to high precision, and one
would have expected similar agreement in the case of the
7D5/2 and 9D5/2 state.

The results for the tensor polarizabilities for the 7DJ,
9DJ , and 10DJ states in cesium are compared with the
experimental values from Refs. [4, 10, 11, 12] and theo-
retical values from Ref. [13] in Table VI. The polarizabil-
ities are also given in 103 a3

nD3/2 states support the measurements of Refs. [4, 10]
and disagree with the less precise previous measurements
[11, 12]. The comparison of the nD5/2 values with ex-
periment mirrors the result of the comparison for the
scalar polarizabilities: the 7D5/2 and 9D5/2 values dif-
fer signiﬁcantly from the experiment while the 10D5/2

IV. CALCULATION OF HYPERFINE
CONSTANTS

In this section we evaluate the current knowledge
about the hyperﬁne constants of the D3/2 and D5/2 states
of cesium. We describe a calculation of the hyperﬁne
constants for the 5D3/2 − 10D3/2 and 5D5/2 − 10D5/2
states of 133Cs. Then we compare the results of the cal-
culation to previously measured values. The calculation
of the hyperﬁne constants also makes use of the rela-
tivistic all-order method and is done in the same way
as the calculation of the electric-dipole matrix elements
and with the same set of the excitation coeﬃcients ρma,
ρmv, ρmnab, and ρmnva (see Eq. (5) ). The breakdown
of the correlation correction to the hyperﬁne constants
A for nD3/2 and nD5/2 states in cesium calculated us-
ing the SD all-order method is given in Table VII. The
expressions for the Terms a, c, d, h, n, and p are given in
[23]. These terms are linear or quadratic functions of the
excitation coeﬃcients. The values of the contributions
of the dominant terms and total correlation correction
are given in % relative to the lowest-order value for each
state. The normalization factor is also listed. We ﬁnd
that the correlation correction is very large, especially

third-order values, and all-order values are compared with

for the D5/2 states where it is several times as large as
the lowest-order value and has an opposite sign. Ow-
ing to such an enormous correlation correction, we do
not expect our results to be very accurate for the nD5/2
states. The scaling procedure described above or partial
ab initio inclusion of the triple excitation as described
in Ref. [25] can only evaluate corrections to terms c and
d, that are not dominant for any of the states except
5D3/2. Therefore, we can not make an accurate estimate
of the uncertainty of our values that is independent from
experimental measurements.

Our results for the hyperﬁne constants A (MHz) for the
nD state in Cs are compared with previous experiments
in Table VIII. We list the lowest-order and “dressed”
third-order values together with the SD all-order values.
The “dressed” third-order calculation has all lowest-order
matrix elements replaced by “dressed” matrix elements
calculated in the random-phase approximation (RPA)
[27]. We ﬁnd large discrepancies between the third-order
and all-order results indicating very large contributions
from the fourth- and higher-order terms. Taking into
account the very large size of the correlation correction
and obviously large contributions from higher orders, we
ﬁnd that the agreement of the all-order calculation with
measured values is remarkably good.

We have investigated the issue of the consistency of
the experimental hyperﬁne data using our calculation.
Table VII demonstrates that the breakdown of the corre-
lation for the 6D −10D states is rather similar, especially
for nD3/2 states. We note that nD3/2 and nD5/2 states
have to be considered separately. The distributions of the
correlation for both 5D3/2 and 5D5/2 states are clearly
very diﬀerent from the ones for the other nD states, and
these states are omitted from the consistency check be-
low. For the nD5/2 states, the relative contribution of
Term h changes sign; however, the contribution from this
term is small in comparison with the experimental un-

10

certainty. To cross-check the experimental data, we take
the experimental value for one particular nDJ state and
rescale it for all the other states with the same J us-
ing the theoretical values of the correlation corrections.
The correlation correction is calculated as the diﬀerence
between the ﬁnal (experimental or theoretical) number
and the lowest-order DHF value. For example, we take
the experimental value AExpt
6D3/2 and determine how much
we need to scale our theoretical correlation correction for
the 6D3/2 state to obtain this value. The scaling factor
is deﬁned as

S(6D3/2) =

AExpt
ASD

6D3/2 − ADHF
6D3/2
6D3/2 − ADHF
6D3/2

,

where ADHF and ASD are the lowest-order and all-order
values from Table VIII for the 6D3/2 state. Next, we
take our theoretical value for another state, for example,
7D3/2, and rescale its correlation correction contribution
using the scaling factor S(6D3/2):

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

ASD

+ ADHF

7D3/2 − ADHF
7D3/2

A(7D3/2) = S(6D3/2) ×

7D3/2 .
(6)
Then, we calculate A(8D3/2), A(9D3/2), and A(10D3/2)
using Eq. (6). We list these values in the column labeled
S(6D3/2) of Table IX which indicates that these values
were obtained with the scaling factor S(6D3/2). We re-
peat the procedure using other nD3/2 values to deﬁne
the scaling factor. The uncertainty of the rescaled val-
ues comes only from the experimental uncertainty of the
initial experimental value AExpt
. We ﬁnd that all results
nDJ
in each row are consistent within the uncertainties, lead-
ing to the conclusion that the experimental results are
internally consistent. We note that such a procedure will
not be able to detect a systematic shift of all the experi-
mental results. Since we cannot accurately evaluate the
uncertainty of the scaling procedure itself, it is unclear
if it can yield data that are more accurate than the cor-
responding experimental data, even though some of the
rescaled data has smaller uncertainties than the actual
experimental data. The accuracy of the rescaling is ex-
pected to be higher when ∆n between the original and
scaled state is the smallest.

V. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND
ESTIMATE OF THE HYPERFINE CONSTANTS

The theoretical calculations of the hyperﬁne constants
described in the previous section as well as the exper-
imental measurements of [5] contained large uncertain-
ties. The scaling procedure seems to indicate that the ex-
perimental values of the review [5], although taken from
diﬀerent sources, are consistent with each other. Thus,
there is an indication that the scaling procedure could

give data obtained by taking the experimental value for this particular nDJ state and rescaling it for all the other states using
the theoretical values for the correlation correction as explained in the text. The uncertainty of the rescaled values comes only
from the experimental uncertainty of the initial experimental value nDJ .

of one state is known. The experiment described in Sec-
tion II could provide an independent cross-check of these
ﬁndings.

With the tensor polarizabilities calculated in section
III, the simulations described in section II can be used
to estimate the hyperﬁne constant. First, we calculate
a series of simulated curves, varying those experimental
parameters that we cannot measure precisely, in partic-
ular the detuning of the lasers. When the overall shape
of the simulated curve matches the experiment, the po-
sitions of the features depend on the values of the tensor
polarizability α2 and the hyperﬁne constant A.

We assume that the tensor polarizabilities calculated
in section III for the 7,9, and 10D5/2 states of cesium
are the most accurate values available because of the ex-
cellent agreement between the calculated and previously
measured values for the 10D3/2 state of cesium. By ﬁx-
ing the tensor polarizability at the calculated value in our
simulations, we can thus estimate the hyperﬁne constant
A from the level-crossing signals in Figures 4, 5, and 6.

Table X summarizes the polarizabilities used in the
simulations and the hyperﬁne values A obtained after a
ﬁt to the experimental data.

Considering the diﬃculty in calculating the hfs con-
stants, the results of the relativistic many-body calcula-
tion for the hyperﬁne constant A agree reasonably well
with the experimental measurements for the 7D5/2 and
9D5/2 states (within ∼ 1.5σ). The large discrepancy in
the case of the 10D5/2 state seems problematic, since
the calculations should be internally consistent, if not
completely reliable in absolute terms. This inconsistency
could indicate that we slightly underestimated our un-

check is less reliable in the case of the nD5/2 states, be-
cause the DHF term and the all order term diﬀer even in
their sign.

VI. CONCLUSION

We obtained new values for the hfs constants A of the
7,9, and 10D5/2 states. Our values agreed with previously
measured values, but achieved greater precision. The val-
ues were obtained by means of measured level-crossing
signals, a detailed theoretical description of these signals,
and values for the tensor polarizability calculated with
an all-order relativistic many-body method. We demon-
strated the all-order relativistic many-body method’s re-
liability even in highly excited states of 133Cs by com-
paring scalar and tensor polarizabilities obtained by this
method with previously experimentally measured values
for the 7,9,10D3/2 and 7,9,10D5/2 states of 133Cs.

Our calculated polarizability values were in good
agreement with experiment except for the 7 and 9D5/2
states. However, the experimental values reported for
these states are called into question by the fact that
values reported in the same works for the 7D3/2 [12]
and 9D3/2 [11] states also disagree with our calculations,
whereas more recent measurements of the 7 and 9D3/2
states [4] support our calculation, as well as previous cal-
culations [13]. The method was further applied to calcu-
late values for the hyperﬁne constants A in the 5-10D3/2
and 5-10D5/2 states. Although the calculation cannot be
considered reliable in absolute terms, nevertheless they
agreed reasonably well in the case of the 7D5/2 and 9D5/2
states. For the 10D5/2 state, the agreement was not as
good.

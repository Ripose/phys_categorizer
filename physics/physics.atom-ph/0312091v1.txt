The ﬁrst absolute (e,3e) measurements, by Lahmam-Bennani et al.

[Phys. Rev. A 59, 3548
(1999)], have been recently approximately reproduced by Berakdar [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4036 (2000)]
and supported by Jones and Madison [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 07321 (2003)], but with widely diﬀering
conclusions. The former indirectly implied that the Born-CCC-based calculations of Kheifets et al.
[J. Phys. B 32, 5047 (1999) were invalid due to the reliance on the 1st Born approximation. The
latter argued that the 1st Born approximation was valid, but the wrong initial state was used. We
investigate these claims and ﬁnd that the original calculations of Kheifets et al. are reproduced
whether the 2nd Born approximation is incorporated or if we use a ground state similar to that of
Jones and Madison, but appropriately corrected as done by Le Sech and co-workers [J. Phys. B 23,
L739 (1990)].

When attempting calculations of complex collision pro-
cesses we have found it important to utilise a formalism
where convergence of the results can be tested by sub-
stantial variation of as many of the input parameters as
possible. The goal is to develop a predictive theory whose
outcomes can be relied upon on scientiﬁc merit irrespec-
tive of agreement with experiment or other theory. The
convergent close-coupling (CCC) method [1] was devel-
oped with this idea in mind. The total wavefunction
is expanded utilising a complete Laguerre basis and so
greater accuracy is ensured with increasing basis size. In
the Coulomb three-body problems, such as e-H scatter-
ing, once convergence is reached there is no freedom left
to alter the results. Hence, when there is disagreement
with experiment as discussed in Ref. [1], that may be even
explained by others [2] or improved upon [3], we ﬁnd that
new experiments [4, 5] are supportive of the original CCC
results. The predictive power of the CCC approach to
double photoionization (DPI or γ,2e) was demonstrated
more recently when initial disagreement with experiment
[6] was resolved in favor of the CCC calculations [7].

Whereas in e-H calculations convergence considera-
tions relate primarily to the usage of the Laguerre ba-
sis, in (γ,2e) calculations there is additional considera-
tion of convergence with respect to the description of
the initial state. In the more complicated Coulomb four-
body problem that is electron-impact double ionization
of helium (e,3e) there are further considerations of con-
vergence with respect to the Born approximation order
used to treat the case of a fast projectile. It is these issues
that are of interest to us in the present Letter.

The physics of the He (e,3e) reaction in the very fast
projectile mode where the incident electron has an or-
der of magnitude or more energy than the two “slow”
ejected electrons is quite similar to the case of (γ,2e). In
both cases the initial and ﬁnal atomic states are three-
body problems of the He2+ nucleus interacting with the

two slow electrons. The application of the CCC method
to (e,3e) process under these kinematical conditions is
straightforward and expected to produce results as accu-
rate as those for (γ,2e). However, the ﬁrst Born CCC
calculation of (e,3e) on He at 5.6 keV incident energy
[8] was found signiﬁcantly lower in magnitude (by fac-
tors of ∼ 3 and ∼ 12 for 10 and 4 eV ejected electrons,
respectively) as compared with absolute measurements
of Lahmam-Bennani et al. [9]. Such a strong disagree-
ment could only be attributed to deviation from the ﬁrst
Born regime since the treatment of the initial and ﬁnal
states was the same in the CCC (γ,2e) and (e,3e) cal-
culations. Some indications of that followed from the
work of Berakdar [10] who reported a good agreement
with absolute measurements [9] on the basis of a lowest-
order implementation of a Faddeev-type approach. These
calculations diﬀered signiﬁcantly for electron or positron
impact (by about a factor of 2) thus invalidating the ﬁrst
Born approximation.

This conclusion, however, was challenged by the re-
cent work of Jones and Madison [11] who managed to
get good agreement, both in shape and magnitude, with
the experiment of Lahmam-Bennani et al. [9] and the cal-
culations of Berakdar [10] while staying entirely within
the ﬁrst Born formalism. As in the ﬁrst Born calculations
presented in Lahmam-Bennani et al. [9], Jones and Madi-
son [11] used the asymptotically exact 3C ﬁnal state, but
with a diﬀerent helium ground state. They argued that
Hylleraas-based ground states, as employed earlier [8, 9],
fail to satisfy the Kato cusp conditions [12] and are inac-
curate when the two electrons are close together. In sup-
port of their argument, Jones and Madison [11] employed
the Pluvinage ground state [13] which treated the inter-
electron interaction to all orders of perturbation theory
and satisﬁed Kato’s cusp conditions exactly. This com-
bination of the 3C ﬁnal state and the Pluvinage ground
state restored agreement with experiment of Lahmam-

Bennani et al. [9] within the ﬁrst Born model.

In this Letter, we review our earlier (e,3e) calculations
[8] in the light of these new theoretical ﬁndings [10, 11].
Following the implementation of the 2nd Born term [14]
we are able to test the contribution of this term for the
kinematics considered here. We have also implemented
the Pluvinage ground state and its improved version as
prescribed by Le Sech and co-workers [15, 16], who ar-
gued that the former lacked the screening of two-particle
interactions by the third particle. Finally, we used a
much bigger CCC expansion, than that used previously
[8], in describing the ﬁnal state. The new initial and ﬁnal
states are ﬁrst applied to helium DPI to check the gauge-
dependence as a function of energy. Subsequently, we
consider the corresponding (γ,2e) and (e,3e) cases with
two 10 eV outgoing electrons. Given the relatively low
momentum transfer in the (e,3e) experiment we expect
it to be close to the optical limit.

The probability of the (e,3e) reaction is given by the

fully-diﬀerential cross-section (FDCS):

as the Fourier transform of the Coulomb interaction V =
|r0 − r1|−1 + |r0 − r2|−1 − Z/r0 between the projectile
and the target. Here Z = 2 is the nucleus charge and q =
k0 − k′ is the momentum transfer. In writing Eqs. (1-2)
we use a continuum wave normalization hk|k′i = δ(k−k′)
which gives the incident ﬂux j = k0/(2π)3. By setting
q → 0 we reach the optical limit. In this limit angular
correlations of the two ejected electrons are the same in
(e,3e) and (γ,2e) reactions if we align the vector q with
the polarization axis of light. The magnitudes of the
corresponding cross-sections diﬀer by a universal scaling
factor.

In contrast to the projectile-target interaction, which is
treated here in the ﬁrst and second orders of the pertur-
bation theory, the interaction of the two ejected electrons
is taken into account fully. To obtain the two-electron
wave function Ψk1k2(r1, r2) we employ the convergent
close-coupling (CCC) formalism [8].
In brief, the ﬁnal
state wave function is expanded over the channel func-
tions each of which is a product of a true continuum state
and a positive energy pseudostate. The latter is obtained
by diagonalizing the target Hamiltonian in the Laguerre
square integrable basis. The multiple interaction between
the two ejected electrons is included by solving the inte-
gral Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Following the suc-
cessful application of the CCC formalism to (e,2e) equal
energy-sharing cross sections [18] we take Laguerre basis

2

exponential fall-oﬀ parameters to be the same for all l ≤ 4
and basis sizes Nl = 60 − l. All open plus lowest three
closed states were included in the calculations. Previ-
ously [8], with smaller computational resources, we were
restricted to Nl = 17 − l and had to vary the exponen-
tial fall-oﬀ parameters for each l ≤ 4 to avoid inaccuracy
associated with interpolation of the complex amplitudes.
Some minor variation of the present results from those
published previously is due to the very diﬀerent choices
of the Laguerre bases used here.

In our earlier paper [8] we calculated only the ﬁrst Born
amplitude (2) using two accurate ground state wave func-
tions: a 15-term multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock and a
20-term Hylleraas. These two wave functions produced
nearly identical results in the two gauges of the Born op-
erator - length and velocity. In the present investigation
we begin with the Pluvinage ground state:

where

(3)

Φ0(η, kr12) = e

1F1(1 − iη, 2, 2ikr12).

−ikr12

The non-correlated part of the ground state (3) is the
product of the two hydrogenic orbitals in the ﬁeld Z =
2. The correlation factor Φ0(η, kr12) with η = (2k)−1
describes the center-of-mass motion of the electron pair
unimpeded by the nucleus.

Le Sech and co-workers [15, 16] suggested that the orig-
inal Pluvinage ground state [13] could be improved by
introducing the screening of the inter-electron interac-
tion by the nucleus. This can be implemented by chang-
ing the eﬀective strength of the Coulomb interaction to
η = q (2k)−1 where q < 1.
In addition, the screening
of the electron-nucleus interaction by another electron
can be accommodated by introducing the shielding fac-
tor cosh(λr1) + cosh(λr2) in the non-correlated part of
the ground state with λ < 1. This shielding eﬀect is
well known and can be incorporated into the simplest
non-correlated ground state by introducing an eﬀective
charge Z −5/16 where Z is the charge of the nucleus [17].
In Fig. 1 we show the double-to-single photoionization
cross-section ratio for He from threshold to intermediate
energies where it is highly sensitive to electron correla-
tion in the ground state. We performed calculations with
three diﬀerent ground state wave functions: Pluvinage,
Le Sech and Hylleraas. Should the ground and ﬁnal
states be exact, the calculations in the three gauges of
the electromagnetic operator, the length, velocity and
acceleration, would be identical. Numerical diﬀerence
between the three gauges is an indicator of the lack of
accuracy in the wave functions. As the ﬁnal state is iden-
tical in all three calculations, gauge-dependence indicates
the inaccuracy of the ground state. The gauge conver-
gence is worst for the Pluvinage ground state. Only the
acceleration gauge, which takes most of its strength at
small distances near the nucleus, gives good results. The
two other gauges, the length and velocity, which are sat-
urated at large and intermediate distances respectively,

are in strong disagreement with each other and the ex-
periment [19]. The Le Sech ground state brings signiﬁ-
cant reduction in the gauge variation, particularly at the
energy of interest to us here of 20 eV above threshold.
The Hylleraas ground state yields excellent agreement
between the three gauges and the experiment.

To investigate the ground state eﬀects further, we cal-
culate the angular distribution of the two equal energy
photoelectrons E1 = E2 = 10 eV in the form of the triply
diﬀerential cross-section (TDCS) which is obtained from
FDCS (1) in the optical limit q → 0. This TDCS is the
counterpart of the FDCS reported in the experiments of
Lahmam-Bennani et al. [9]. In Fig. 2 we show the TDCS
for a ﬁxed angle of one of the photoelectrons whereas the
second electron is detected on the full angular range. We
choose θ1 = 60◦ where the TDCS is largest in magni-
tude. As in the case of the total DPI cross-section, the
Pluvinage ground state gives the worst results, especially
in the length form. Gauge invariance and agreement with
experiment is much better with the Le Sech and Hyller-
aas ground states.

lations with diﬀerent ground states (top - Pluvinage, middle -
Le Sech, bottom - Hylleraas) are shown in the length, velocity
and acceleration (L, V, and A) gauges. The line styles are as
in Fig. 1. The experimental data are from Br¨auning et al.
[20].

Pluvinage ground state in DPI has severe implications
for (e,3e) calculations which are also performed in the
length gauge of the Born operator (2). Results of the
CCC calculations of the (e,3e) FDCS is shown on the
top row of panels in Fig. 3. As in Figs. 1 and 2, we
show calculations with three ground state wave functions:
Pluvinage, Le Sech and Hylleraas. In addition, the calcu-
lations were performed utilising the ﬁrst and second Born
approximations [14] and found to be indistinguishable
(similar conclusion was reached in Ref. [21]). We choose
the ﬁxed ejected electron angles at the values where the
four-body Green’s function calculations of Berakdar [10]
are available. Results of this calculation along with the
3C-Pluvinage calculation of Jones and Madison [11] are
shown on the bottom panels.

In the top panel, scaling factors of 2.2 and 1.8 have to
be applied to the CCC calculations with the Hylleraas
and Le Sech ground states, respectively, to match the
experiment. The shape of the FDCS calculated with the
Pluvinage ground state is very diﬀerent from the exper-
iment and the other two calculations. A scaling factor
of six was applied to this calculation to put it approxi-
mately on the same scale as the experiment. On the other

CCC ﬁnal state for the kinematics considered irrespec-
tive of the initial state. Finally, we have checked the
absolute relations between the (γ,2e) and (e,3e) calcula-
tions and ﬁnd them consistent. Consequently, we stand
by the original approach to the problem [8]. Fundamen-
tally, we argue that the physics of the (e,3e) process of
the type considered here is closely related to the corre-
sponding (γ,2e) process. We are hopeful that this work
will stimulate further experimental and theoretical study
of the subject.

hand, in the bottom panel, the two 3C-based calculations
of Berakdar [10] and Jones and Madison [11] agree be-
tween themselves and with the absolute measurements of
Lahmam-Bennani et al. [9] without any additional scal-
ing. However, we must recall that simply changing the
charge of the projectile will destroy the good agreement
between the two 3C-based calculations.

Thus, we encounter the extraordinary situation where
we have conﬁdence in our results even though they dis-
agree with experiment and two other theories, all of
which agree with each other. We do not agree with the
implicit conclusion of Berakdar [10] that the ﬁrst Born
approximation is insuﬃcient for the problem at hand.
While Jones and Madison [11] also argue this, they use
the Pluvinage ground state which we have shown here not
to work for DPI or (e,3e) when combined with the CCC ﬁ-
nal state. However, when this ground state was improved
to yield the Le Sech state, which still satisﬁes the Kato’s
cusp conditions, the results yielded good agreement with
the originally used Hylleraas ground state. We do not
accept that the 3C ﬁnal state can work better than the

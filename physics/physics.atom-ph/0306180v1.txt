Fundamental physical constants play important role in modern physics. Studies of their
variation can open an interface to new physics. An overview of diﬀerent approaches to
a search for such variations is presented as well as possible reasons for the variations.
Special attention is paid to laboratory searches.

1 Introduction

Any interactions of particles and compound objects such as atoms and molecules
are described by some Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) and constancy of parameters of
the basic Lagrangian is a cornerstone of modern physics. Electric charge, mass and
magnetic moment of the particle are parameters of the Lagrangian. However, there
are a few simple reasons why we have to expect the nature to be not so simple.

• A theory described by a Lagrangian suggests some properties of the space-
time. It seems that introducing gravitation we arrive to some inconsistency
of a classical description of the space-time continuum and that means that
the picture must be more complicated. It is not necessary, however, that the
complicated nature imply variable constants, but it is possible.

• In particle/nuclear/atomic/molecular physics we deal with the eﬀective La-
grangians. The “true” fundamental Lagrangian is deﬁned at the Planck scale
for elementary objects (leptons, quarks and gauge bosons) and we can study
only its “low-energy” limit with a pointlike electron and photon and extended
hadrons and nuclei.

• One more reason is presence of some amount of matter, which selects a pre-
ferred frame and produces some background ﬁelds. In usual experiments we
often have problems with environment and have either to produce some shield-
ing or to subtract the environment contribution. However, we cannot ignore
the whole Universe and its evolution.

• The expansion of Universe may lead to some speciﬁc time and space depen-
dence in atomic transitions which are similar to a variation of “constants”.

An illustration can be found in the so-called inﬂation model of evolution of the
Universe (see e.g. 1). The Standard Model of evolution suggests a phase transition
in some very early part which dramatically changed properties of electrons and
photons. It happens without any changes of the unperturbed parameters of the basic
Lagrangian deﬁned at the Planck scale. A change of the electron mass (from zero to
some nonvanishing value of me) arose eventually from cooling of matter caused by

1

expansion. Meanwhile photon properties were changed via renormalization going
from the Planck scale down to our real world (which is very diﬀerent for a zero and
non-zero electron mass).

Considering variation of the fundamental constants we have to clearly recognize
two kinds of a search. The ﬁrst one is related to the most sensitive and easily
accessible quantities. In such a case a limitation for the variation is the strongest
and easiest to obtain, but sometimes it is not clear what fundamental quantity it
is related to. An example is a study of samarium resonance by absorption of a
thermal neutron 2

149Sm + n → 150Sm + γ .

(1)

Estimations led to an extremely low possible variation but it is hard to express it in
terms of the ﬁne structure constant or some other fundamental constant (see Sec.
11 for detail).

The other kind of a search is provided by a study of quantities which can be
clearly related to the fundamental constants such as optical transitions (see 3 and
Sec. 8 for detail).

One may wonder whether it is really important to interpret a variation of some
not fundamental value (such as a position of a resonance) in terms of some fun-
damental quantities. A fact of the variation itself must be a great discovery more
important than the exact value of the variation rate of the ﬁne structure constant
α or another basic constant. A problem, however, is related to the nature of pre-
cision tests and searches. Any of them is realized on the edge of our ability to
perform calculations and measurements and any single result on the variation is
not suﬃcient since a number of sources of new systematic eﬀects, which were not
important previously at the lower level of accuracy, may appear now. It is crucially
important to be able to make a comparison of diﬀerent results and to check if they
are consistent.

In our paper we ﬁrst try to answer a few basic questions about the constants:

• Are the fundamental constants fundamental?

• Are the fundamental constants constant?

• What hierarchy of the variation rate can be expected for various basic con-

stants?

After a brief overview of most important results we consider advantages and
disadvantages of laboratory searches and in particular experiments with optical
frequency standards.

2 Are the fundamental constants fundamental?

First of all, we have to note that we are mainly interested in searches for a possible
variation of dimensionless quantities. A search of the variation of constants is
based on comparison of two measurements of the same quantity separated in time
and/or space. For such a comparison, the units could also vary with time and their
realization should be consistent for separate measurements. In principle, we can

2

compensate or emulate a variation of a dimensional quantity via a redeﬁnition of
the units. To avoid the problem we have to compare dimensionless quantities, which
are unit-independent. E.g., studying some spectrum we can make a statement on
the variation of the ﬁne structure constants α, but not on the variation of speed of
light c, Planck constant ¯h or electric charge of the electron e separately.

However, the variation of dimensional quantities can in principle be detected in
a diﬀerent kind of experiment. If we have to recognize which constant is actually
varying, we should study eﬀects due to their time- and space- gradients. We do not
consider such experiments in this paper.

Precision studies related to astrophysics as well as atomic and nuclear physics
deal with characteristics which can be linked to the values of the charge, mass and
magnetic moment of an electron, proton and neutron, deﬁned as their properties
for real particles (i.e. at E2 = p2c2 + m2c4) at zero momentum transfer. In the case
of nuclear transitions, variation of the pulsar periods etc we can hardly interpret
any results in terms of the fundamental constants, while in the case of atomic and
molecular transitions that can be done (see Sec. 6).

We can combine the constants important for spectroscopy into a small number

of basic combinations:

any frequency;

• one dimensional constant (e.g., the Rydberg constant Ry) is needed to describe

• a few basic dimensionless constants, such as

– the ﬁne structure constant α;
– the electron-to-proton mass ratio me/mp;
– the proton g factor gp;
– the neutron g factor gn

are needed to describe any ratio of two frequencies.

As mentioned above, any variation of a dimensional constant cannot be success-
fully detected: in the case of the astrophysical measurement it will be interpreted
as a contribution to the red shift and removed from further analysis, while in the
laboratory experiments it will lead to the variation of the second, deﬁned via cesium
hyperﬁne structure. A variation of the value of the Rydberg constant in respect
to the cesium hyperﬁne interval is detectable since it is a dimensionless quantity.
However, a physical meaning of such variation can not be interpreted in terms of
the Rydberg constant as a fundamental constant, its possible variation should be
due to a variation of the cesium magnetic moment (in units of the Bohr magneton)
and the ﬁne structure constant.

Nature of the g factor of the proton and neutron is not well understood and
in particular it is not clear if their variations can be considered as independent.
Obviously, the g factors are not truly fundamental constants, arising as a result of
strong interaction in the regime of strong coupling.

Concerning the ﬁne structure constant, we ﬁrst have to mention that it is a
result of renormalization while some more fundamental quantities are deﬁned at
the Planck scale.

3

The origin of the electron and proton mass is diﬀerent. The electron mass is
determined by the details of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model of the elec-
troweak interactions, however, this sector originates from some higher-level theory
and a really fundamental constant is rather m0/M , where m0 is a “bare” electron
mass (i.e. the mass prior to the renormalization which is needed to reach the elec-
tron mass m for a real electron) and M is a “big” mass related to some combination
of the Planck mass and the compactiﬁcation radius (if we happen to live in a mul-
tidimensional world). In the case of proton the situation is diﬀerent. Most of the
proton mass is proportional to ΛQCD (see e.g. 4,5), which can be expressed in terms
of the unperturbed interaction constant and a big mass M ′. The latter is some
combination of the Planck mass and compactiﬁcation radius, but it is not the same
as M . A small portion of the proton mass and in particular mp − mn comes from
the mass of current quarks, theory of which is similar to theory of the electron mass.
The values of m0/M and ΛQCD/M can in principle be expressed in terms of the
parameters of the basic Lagrangian deﬁned at the Planck scale.

Studies of the gravitational interaction can provide us with a limitation for a
variation of mp/M , however, the limitations are much weaker than those obtained
from spectroscopy (see e.g. 6. Performing spectroscopic measurements we can reach
a limitation for a value of me/mp, however, it is rather an accidental value, in
contrast to m0/M and ΛQCD/M , and its interpretation involves a number of very
diﬀerent eﬀects.

3 Are fundamental constants constant?

We have to acknowledge that some variations, or eﬀects which may be interpreted
as variations have happened in past and are present now.

• A Standard model of the evolution of our Universe, has a special period with
inﬂation of Universe due to a phase transition which happened at a very
early stage of the evolution and signiﬁcantly changed several properties of
particles (see e.g. 1). In particular, the electron mass and so-called current
quark masses (the latter are responsible for a small part of the nucleon mass
and in particular for the diﬀerence of the proton and neutron mass) were
changed. Prior to the phase transition the electron was massless. The proton
mass determined by so called ΛQCD was essentially the same. At the present
time the renormalization of the electric charge only slightly aﬀects the charge
because it has an order of α/π ln(M/m). However, with massless leptons the
renormalization has not only ultraviolet divergence but also an infrared one.
The phase transition for the electron mass m is also a phase transition for its
electric charge e. The transition was caused by cooling of the Universe, and
cooling was a result of expansion. The Universe is still expanding and cooling.
It should lead to some variation of m and e but signiﬁcantly below a level of
accuracy available for experiments and observations now.

• Expansion of the Universe should modify the Dirac equation for the hydrogen
atom and any other atoms and nuclei. However, the expansion itself, without
any time and space gradients will just create a red shift common for any atoms

4

and transitions in an area. The second order eﬀect gives an acceleration (note
that for a preliminary estimation one can set H ′ ∼ H 2). The acceleration will
shift energy levels but produce no time variation. And only the H 3 term can
give a time dependent correction to the energy levels. It is indeed beyond any
experimental possibility.

• In principle, we also have to acknowledge that if the Universe has a ﬁnite size,
that must produce an infrared cut oﬀ which should enter into equations. Since
we do not have any real infrared divergence for any observable quantity, the
radius of the Universe will enter the expressions for the electric charge and
mass of electron in combinations such as (a0/RU )2 and the ratio of the Bohr
radius and the radius of the Universe is extremely small. With the expansion
of the Universe, the radius RU (t) is time dependent and that will give some
small (undetectable) variation of the constants. The real situation is not so
simple. First, we do not know if the Universe has a ﬁnite size. Second, doing
ﬁnite time experiments we have to deal with some horizon and that does
not depend on a size of the Universe. It is unclear how the cut oﬀ due to
the horizon problem will interfere with the expansion of the Universe and its
radius (if RU is ﬁnite).

The discussed eﬀects are small and not detectable now. It is even not clear whether
they may be detected in principle, however, they demonstrate a clear indication
that

• a property of fundamental basic particles, like their charge and mass of the

electron, should vary with time;

• a property of compound objects, such as atoms and nucleus, should vary with

time even if properties of their components are not varying.

The main question is the following: is there any reason for a faster variation, which
can be detected with current experimental accuracy? This question has not yet
been answered.

4 Time and space variations

Most considerations in literature have been devoted to the time variation. However,
an astrophysical search (which has only provided us with possibly positive results)
cannot distinguish between space and time variations, since remote astrophysical
objects are separated from us both in time and space.

To accept space variation is perhaps essentially the same as to suggest existence
of some Goldstone modes. There is none for the Standard Model of the electroweak
interactions, there are some experimental limitations on the Goldstone modes for
Grand Uniﬁcation Theories (see e.g. 7), but it is diﬃcult to exclude them completely.
Another option is some domain structure. In the case of “large” domains with the
ﬁnite speed of light and horizon any easy conjunction of two domains is unlikely
even reducing the total vacuum energy. A domain structure can be formed at the
time of inﬂation when the Universe was expanding so fast that in a very short time

5

two previously causality-connected points could be very far from each other – out
of horizon of each other. There is a number of reasons that a domain structure
due to a parameter directly related to the vacuum energy cannot exist, since the
energy would tend to reach its minimum. But if a construction like the Cabibbo-
Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is a result of spontaneously broken symmetry,
we could expect some minor ﬂuctuations of CKM parameters, such as the Cabibbo
angle, which were approximately, but not exactly, the same at some early time
with their evolution being completely independent because of the horizon problem.
CKM contributions are due to the weak interactions for hadrons and they slightly
shift magnetic moments of proton and neutron at a fractional level of 10−5 and
that is how such eﬀects could be studied via precision spectroscopy. They are also
important for the neutron lifetime and their variation could change the nuclear
synthesis phemonena. We also have to underline that the space distribution with
an expansion of the horizon and on their way to an equilibrium should provide some
time evolution.

5 Scenario and hierarchy

A possibility of time variation of the values of the fundamental constants at a
cosmological scale was ﬁrst suggested quite a long time ago 8,9, but we still have no
basic common idea on a possible nature of such a variation. A number of papers
were devoted to the estimation of a possible variation of one of the fundamental
constants (e.g. the ﬁne structure constant α) while a possible variation of any other
properties is neglected. As we stated in 10, one has to consider a variation of all
constants with approximately the same rate. However, some hierarchy (with rates
diﬀerent by an order of magnitude or even more) can be presented and it strongly
depend on a scenario. There is a number of “model dependent” and “nearly model
independent” estimations of the variation of the constants and their hierarchy.

• Any estimation based on running constants in SU(5) or in a similar uniﬁcation
theory is rather “near model independent”. In particular, that is related to a
statement on a faster variation of mp/M than α (see e.g. 4,5,11).

• Any estimation in the Higgs sector of SU(5) and other GUTs 11, SUSY, quan-

tum gravitation, strings etc strongly depends on the model.

We would like to clarify what is model-dependent in “near model independent”
considerations. It does not strongly depend on model suggestions in particle physics,
but one still needs a basic suggestion on why (and how) any variation can happen.
There may be a universal cause all the time, or there may be a few “phases” with
diﬀerent causes dominating at diﬀerent stages etc. What could be a basic cause for
the dynamics? E.g. the basic suggestion for an SU(5) estimation is that everything
can be derived from the Lagrangian 4,5,11 with varying parameters. In other words,
for some reason there is dynamics operating within the Lagrangian.

• A supporting example is a multidimensional Universe with compactiﬁcation
of extra dimensions and the compactiﬁcation radius R as an ultraviolet cut-oﬀ
Λ = ¯h/Rc (see e.g. 4). Slow variation of R is suggested (e.g. an oscillation

6

at a cosmological time scale). All variations of the constants arise from the
basic Lagrangian via the renormalization with a variation of the cut oﬀ and
a variation in the Higgs sector induced directly by the variation of R.

• On the contrary, it may be suggested that dynamics comes from a quantum
nature of space-time and in terms of the Lagrangian that could lead to some
new eﬀective terms violating some basic symmetries of the “unperturbed”
Lagrangian (indeed as a small perturbation). In such a case no reason due to
SU(5) is valid and one has to start with a description of the perturbing terms.

Both options are open.

The “model dependent” estimations involve more unknown factors, they need
understanding of both: a uniﬁcation/extension scheme and a cause for the variation.
We need to mention an option that in principle the fundamental constants
might be calculable. That does not contradict their variations, which can be caused
by presence of some amount of matter, or by an oscillation of the compactiﬁcation
radius etc. In such a case, the truly fundamental constants α0 ∼ 10−2 (the bare
e/MP ∼ 10−22, ΛQCD /MP ∼ 10−20 are of very diﬀerent order
electric charge), m0
of magnitude (here MP is the Planck mass). The constants (α and (m, Λ)/MP )
of so diﬀerent order of magnitude can be either coupled logarithmically or not
coupled at all. In the case of α and ΛQCD /M there is some understanding of this
logarithmic coupling (see e.g. 4,5) which is mainly model independent (a model
dependent part is a relation between MP and a mass of Grand Uniﬁcation Theory
M which enters relationships between the constants). In the case of m0
e/MP model
dependence is essential. However, as it is explained above, it is diﬃcult to realize
if any approximate relations between the constants are helpful or not. A crucial
question is whether the variation supports the relations between the constants or
violates them.

6 Atomic and molecular spectroscopy and fundamental constants

There are three most accurate results on a possible variation of the constants
achieved recently. One of them is related to the Oklo fossil nuclear reactor 12 and
a position of the samarium resonance (1). The result is negative and the assigned
variation rate for the fundamental constants varies between 10−17 and 10−19 yr−1
2,13,14,15. However, the interpretation is rather unclear because there is no reliable
way of studying the position of the resonance in terms of the fundamental constants.

Two other results are related to spectroscopy:

• A study of the absorption spectra of some quasars led to a positive result
on a variation of the ﬁne structure constant of a part in 1015 per a year at
6 σ level 16 (see also earlier papers on a 4 σ positive result 17). Meanwhile,
a search for a variation of me/mp showed a variation at a fractional level of
(5 ± 2) × 10−15 yr−1 18.

• A comparison of hyperﬁne intervals for the ground state in cesium-133 and
rubidium-87 shows no variation of the ratio of their frequencies at a level a

part in 1015 19. The ratio of these frequencies is more sensitive to a variation
of gp than α 10.

Because of importance of the spectroscopic data, we brieﬂy discuss the behavior
of the frequency of diﬀerent kinds of transitions as a function of the fundamental
constants.

Any transition frequency can be presented in the form

f = fNR × FRel(α) ,

(2)

where fNR is the frequency in the leading non-relativistic approximation and FRel(α)
is the relativistic correcting factor. Scaling behavior of the non-relativistic results is
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The relativistic correction is a result of perturbative
calculation of some singular terms since the relativistic eﬀects are enhanced at short
distances equivalent to the large momentum transfer. In neutral atoms and ions
with only a few electrons stripped, the electron is located in the Coulomb ﬁeld with
a low eﬀective charge of the screened nucleus at a long distance (e.g. Zeﬀ ≃ 1 for
neutral alkali atom). On the contrary, at a short distance the electron interacts
rather with the bare nucleus and the eﬀective charge is close to the nuclear charge
Z. As a result, the correcting factor behaves as

FRel(α) = 1 + C2(Zα)2 + ... ,

(3)

for ytterbium and mercury) the correction is not small any

and at high Z (e.g.
more (see e.g. 21,22).

Diﬀerent scaling behavior of the non-relativistic transition frequencies allows to
perform eﬃcient comparison to search for a possible variation of the fundamental
constants. The most accurate astrophysical results were obtained studying tran-
sitions of the same type 16,17, but with essentially diﬀerent values of the nuclear
charge Z and thus with diﬀerent relativistic corrections 22.

7 Hyperﬁne structure and nuclear magnetic moments

Looking for a variation of the fundamental constants with the help of the hyperﬁne
structure, one needs to deal with the nuclear magnetic moments. There is no
accurate model which allows to present the nuclear magnetic moments in terms
of the fundamental constants. The only available model, the Schmidt model, is
not really accurate. We summarize in Table 3 the magnetic moments derived from
the Schmidt model in comparison with the actual values for the atoms applied for
the frequency standards (see also 10). The Table contains also data on relativistic
corrections.

One can see that nuclear eﬀects, responsible for a correction to the Schmidt
model, are comparable to the relativistic eﬀects, responsible for atomic corrections.
Note the signiﬁcant corrections to the Schmidt model for cesium-133 and rubidium-
85. They are large because of a destructive interference of spin and orbit contribu-
tions, an essential cancellation of the leading term enhancing the corrections. The
primary frequency standards are based on the hyperﬁne interval in cesium and the
large corrections to the Schmidt value of the nuclear magnetic moment of cesium-
133 are annoying for a direct interpretation of any absolute measurement, which is
actually a comparison of some transition with the cesium standards.

8 Optical transitions

The essential nuclear eﬀects related to the nuclear magnetic moment lead to a prob-
lem of a reliable interpretation of the data. Much more reliable results are delivered
by studying pure optical transitions 26,27,28,29,30,31 which can be obtained via a di-
rect comparison of two optical frequencies, or indirectly via independent absolute
measurements of those frequencies in units determined by the cesium microwave
transition. Both kinds of comparison are now available for the frequency metrology
after a development of the new frequency chain based on the so-called frequency
comb 32. The most accurate data are summarized in Table 4.

An important feature of the optical transitions related to the gross structure
is that they can be described with the help of two constants only: the Rydberg

While a variation of the Rydberg constant as we discussed above could have no
simple interpretation in terms of the fundamental constants, a time variation of the
ﬁne structure constant would have a direct and simple interpretation. An expected
signature of the time variation of α is depicted in Fig. 1. In near future ﬁve ac-
curate results are expected. Three of them are related to “near α-independent”
results (hydrogen, calcium, indium) and they should play a role of an anchor. Two
others (mercury and ytterbium) are strongly α dependent and the dependence is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (see Table 4).

9 Current laboratory limitations

Current laboratory limitations are summarized in Table 5. A limitation on the time
variation of the proton g factor is derived assuming that the nuclear corrections to

the Schmidt model are not important. That indeed cannot be considered as a
reliable approach. All other limitations are obtained in a more reliable way. As
was pointed out in 10 (see also Table 3), the hyperﬁne interval in cesium is very
diﬃcult for interpretation because of signiﬁcant nuclear corrections to the Schmidt
model. Fortunately, it was demonstrated that there is no variation on a level of
a part in 1015 per a year for a ratio of cesium-to-rubidium hyperﬁne structure 19
(as a matter of fact that is the strongest laboratory limitation on a variation of a
transition frequency). The hyperﬁne interval in the ground state of the rubidium-87
in contrast to cesium-133 can be suﬃciently well described by its non-relativistic
part with use of the Schmidt model for the nuclear magnetic moment 10 (see also
Table 3).

10 Precision spectroscopy: tests and reliability

Recent progress in frequency metrology delivered us a number of results, essentially
more accurate than any previous data and the expected results can be even more
accurate. In such a case we need to be sure that the results are reliable. In this
section we brieﬂy discuss possible tests of the accurate frequency measurements.

is helpful to ﬁx the form of dependence on the nuclear mass and the nuclear
charge radius and the shape of the dependence may be checked via ﬁtting.

• Similar test can be performed studying the hyperﬁne structure. E.g. a com-
parison of the 1s − 2s transitions in hydrogen for diﬀerent spin states 35. Since
the hyperﬁne splitting in the ground state is known with a high accuracy 36,10,
the comparison of the 1s − 2s ultraviolet transitions yields us a value of the
hyperﬁne interval in a metastable 2s state. The result is more accurate that
one directly derived from a microwave measurement 37 and in good agreement
with theory 38. The transitions under study 35 as well as comparison with
theory and early microwave measurements are summarized in Fig. 2.

11 Summary

A comparison of diﬀerent kinds of search for a possible time and space variations of
the fundamental constants is summarized in Table 6. The characteristic level of the
limitations is given suggesting a linear time dependence. In the case of oscillation
the limitation from geochemical search and from astrophysical observations should
be weakened by a factor 2∆t/T , since the period of oscillation T can be shorter
than the time separation ∆t. We note that in the case of laboratory limitation
the results should depend on a current phase of oscillations. Another problem
with interpretation of the astrophysical data is a separatation of space and time
variations. The diﬀerent kinds of search oﬀer access to diﬀerent sets of constants
and their reliability depends on whether they are aﬀected by the strong interactions.
Despite a number of advantages and disadvantages of diﬀerent approaches there
is no favorite way. Since we have no background theory, we need to try as many
searches as possible and as diﬀerent as possible.

There are a number of problems which may be of interest and we’d like to

attract attention to a few of them.

• A comparison of hyperﬁne intervals in the ground state of 85Rb and 87Rb
allows to remove any variation of the ﬁne structure constant due to atomic

interactions and the frequency ratio is sensitive only to the proton g factor via
the Schmidt model and to strong interactions via corrections to the Schmidt
model. Separation of atomic and nuclear physics can be helpful as a test
measurement when a number of microwave intervals related to the hyperﬁne
structure will be studied.

• Actual nuclear magnetic moments of 199Hg and 171Yb are very close (the
diﬀerence is below 5%) and their Schmidt values are the same (see Table 3).
If that is a systematic eﬀect, a comparison of the hyperﬁne intervals in these
two ions can give a reliable result on a possible variation of the ﬁne structure
constant α. We need better understanding of the magnetic moments of 199Hg
and 171Yb.

• Discussing diﬀerent approaches, we need to mention an idea of 39 to study
a 3.5 eV nuclear transition in 229Th which lies in the optical domain.
Its
comparison with atomic transitions can have indeed no reliable interpretation,
but the nuclear transition is very diﬀerent from atomic transitions and may
be sensitive to eﬀects not detectable with other methods.

• Another approach related to the nuclear properties suggested 10 precision stud-
ies of the nuclear magnetic moment with extremely small values, which are ex-
pected to be very sensitive to detuning of the fundamental constants. Indeed,
it is not possible to measure a nuclear magnetic moment accurately enough.
However, looking for their variations one can study the hyperﬁne structure
of proper ions. As an example of an extremely small magnetic moment, let
81 Tl with a magnetic moment below 10−3 µN (T1/2 = 5.3(5) h),
us mention 198
79 Au (µ = −0.009(2) µN , T1/2 = 4.9
62 Sm (µ = −0.022 µN, T1/2 = 46 h) and 192
153
h) 25. Understanding the nature of such small values is also necessary.

• One more question related to the subject: can we detect the expansion of
the Universe in some laboratory experiments? The expansion leads to the
red shift of the photons at a level of 10−10 yr−1, however, there is no way
to study a photon emitted a year ago in laboratory experiments. A chance

13

can appear if we can use objects (planets, spacecrafts) at a distance related
to c × (1 − 10) min.

A search of a possible variation of the values of the fundamental constant
presents a speciﬁc ﬁeld involving both fundamental and applied physics. A search for
new physics is based on frequency metrology providing a high motivation. The fre-
quency metrology presents now limitations which are somewhat weaker than those
from astrophysics but it has showed signiﬁcant progress last years and it seems that
higher accuracy of the laboratory measurements is just a matter of time and new
results will be coming soon.

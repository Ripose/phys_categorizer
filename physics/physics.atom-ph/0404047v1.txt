SELF-CONSISTENT SOLUTION FOR THE POLARIZED
VACUUM IN A NO-PHOTON QED MODEL

CHRISTIAN HAINZL, MATHIEU LEWIN, AND ERIC S´ER´E

Abstract. Starting from a ﬁrst principle QED Hamiltonian, neglecting pho-
tons, we derive a functional – following ideas of Chaix-Iracane [5] – which
allows us to rigorously describe the polarized vacuum in a self-consistent way.
Thereby we develop novel means to characterize charge sectors. Additionally
we perform a charge renormalization scheme applying simultaneously to all
orders of the ﬁne structure constant α.

1. Introduction

Despite the incredible predictive power of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) its
description in terms of perturbation theory restricts its range of applicability. In
fact a mathematical consistent formulation is still unknown. We want to make a
tiny step in that direction. Following ideas from Chaix and Iracane [5] we rigorously
treat a model, which we derive from no-photon QED, describing ground states of
atomic systems. Commonly speaking we deal with divergences arising from vacuum
polarization (VP) eﬀects.

By means of a Bogoliubov transform applied to a standard regularized Hamil-
tonian, describing interacting particle-antiparticle systems, we derive a well deﬁned
Hamiltonian. We impose an ultraviolet momentum cutoﬀ Λ which is a necessity
when dealing with VP-eﬀects. Our only restriction on Λ is its ﬁniteness. Although
VP plays a minor role in the Lamb-shift calculations of low-Z hydrogen-like atoms,
it is important for high-Z atoms [22, 28] and even plays a major role for muonic
atoms [24, 11] and for heavy ion collision [25].

As our main issue we describe a stable polarized vacuum self-consistently in a
non-perturbative way. Such a solution minimizes an appropriate energy functional
and diﬀers slightly from the Furry picture which can be obtained after the ﬁrst
iteration of a ﬁxed point algorithm starting with the projector on the negative
energy spectrum of the free Dirac operator. Additionally we introduce the notion
of supertraceclass operators which turns out to be an appropriate tool to describe
diﬀerent charge sectors. We will discuss a simpliﬁed model in more detail, neglecting
the exchange energy. For the corresponding self-consistent solution of the VP-
density we will perform a fully – to any order – consistent charge renormalization
scheme.

As an application our procedure might be useful for the Lamb-shift calculation
of atomic bound states: usually, see, e.g., [22, 28], one works in the Furry picture,

[4], that an eﬀective potential can be derived by means of Feynman diagrams. How-
ever, we emphasize that our approach is mathematically rigorous, non-perturbative
and works for any charge Z of the external potential.

In other words it consists of the eigenspace generated by the

χ(−∞,0)(H) is often denoted as Λ−(H).)

We use relativistic units ~ = c = 1, set the particle mass equal to one and

P 0
S2(HΛ) is necessary and suﬃcient to guarantee that the Bogoliubov trans-
formation is implementable in the Fock space, which means that there exists a
vacuum vector ΩP in the Fock space, such that aP ΩP = bP ΩP = 0. We do not
specify this implementation in more detail, since we are primarily interested in
the vacuum energy (see, e.g., [14, Appendix]). Evaluating the vacuum expectation
value
only the last two lines of (7) remain representing the energy of
the dressed vacuum P measured with respect to P 0. In the Furry picture, P is

ﬁxed to be the projector P ϕ = χ(−∞,0)(Dϕ), and the energy of P ϕ

with the VP-potentials, more precisely, the ﬁrst term is the interaction with the
P 0](x, x). This density diverges logarithmically in
VP-density ρϕ(x) = trC4[P ϕ

We refer to [16] for an intense study of the Furry picture. Let us remark that

In our case of a general P we do not a priori renormalize: this would destroy
the naturalness of the Hamiltonian. Namely, such a renormalization procedure
would depend on the representation P , therefore the Hamiltonian (7) would be no
longer unitary equivalent with respect to diﬀerent representations. Instead we give
a fully consistent renormalization procedure later on for a slightly simpliﬁed model.
That means we present a renormalization of the vacuum polarization density which
applies simultaneously to any order of α and is in the spirit of the usual charge
renormalization procedure [18, Equ. (7-18)].

In the following we want to concentrate on the vacuum energy, which ceases to
be a constant if one minimizes over P . Such a minimizer, if it exists, we call a
stable vacuum.

The proof of the theorem is complicated and will be given elsewhere [15].
Equation (11) corresponds to Dirac’s picture that the “correct” vacuum P should

be the projector on the negative spectrum of an eﬀective one-body Hamiltonian.

Remark, that in the case without external potential, ϕ = 0, the free projector

P 0 solves (11) and minimizes

[6, 2].

Numerically the self-consistent solution of (11) could be evaluated by a ﬁxed
point algorithm, starting with P 0, which converges to the solution (11) as shown in
(α2). In fact in [14] we prove (11) under reasonable
[14]. Notice thereby P = P ϕ +
restrictions, α√log Λ
0.3, using the Banach ﬁxed point theorem. This proof is
much more constructive than the direct proof in [15], and it might better reﬂect the
smoothness properties corresponding to the solution of (11). In a diﬀerent model
[21] the Banach ﬁxed point theorem was already used to derive a self-consistent
projector.

By means of the next theorem we emphasize the usefulness of the notion of

an integer value and Q denote a vacuum state whose supertrace is an integer.
Consequently the supertrace of the whole object is an integer which shows that the
supertrace is an appropriate tool to describe charge sectors in

Recall up to now the charge was kept to be the bare one. In other words we
did not renormalize the density ρQ. Next we want to derive a consistent renormal-
ization consistent to any order. This distinguishes us from usual renormalization
procedures where only the ﬁrst order (in α) of VP density is renormalized. For that
reason we simplify our vacuum energy by neglecting the exchange term,

From a physical point of view this is quite natural, since the exchange term is usually
treated together with a term describing the interaction with the photon ﬁeld to form
the standard electron self-energy that is a subject of the mass renormalization (see
the remark after (3)).

The proof is on the one hand a direct consequence of the proof of Theorem 1, on
the other hand much simpler. Namely the fact that the functional is convex and
strongly continuous in Q immediately implies that it is weakly lower semicontinuous
on
SΛ. Since it is trivially bounded from below one sees quite easily that the
minimum is attained. To see that the minimum satisﬁes the equation (14) one
proceeds similar to [14, Theorem 3].

In order to perform our renormalization scheme we expand (14) in powers of
α. Using the resolvent representation [19, Section VI, Lemma 5.6] and recalling
ρQ(x) = trC4 Q(x, x) we derive from (14) the self-consistent equation for the VP-

independently of the bare α. This equation uniquely deﬁnes the VP density only
depending on the physical observable αr, which is what we understand under con-
sistent to any order. The αr represents the dressed coupling constant, which is
observed in experiment and whose value is approximately 1/137. Notice that from
formula αr = α

the Uehling potential [3]. Concerning a point like particle this potential was ﬁrst
written down in closed form by Schwinger [26]. The next term in Veﬀ is of order
. In principle all higher order corrections can be evaluated explicitly,
O
which is not the task of our paper, and might play a role in Lamb-shift calculations
of large-Z or muonic atoms. Finally we note that the convergence of the term in
the right hand side of (19), in the case of the VP-density in the Furry picture, i.e.
α3
F3(αn), was shown in various papers. The most clarifying proof with respect to
spurious third order contributions can probably be found in [29] (for earlier proofs,
in particular corresponding to muonic atoms, we refer to the references in [29]).
However the fact that this term, α3
F3(αn), additionally gives rise to a well deﬁned
self-adjoint operator was recently proven in [16].

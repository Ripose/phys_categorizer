We investigate laser-induced nonsequential double ionization using a quantum-mechanical descrip-
tion of a physical process in which the second electron is freed by the inelastic collision of the ﬁrst
electron with its parent ion. In particular, we compute diﬀerential electron momentum distributions
within the Strong-Field Approximation, employing a uniform saddle-point approximation, and in-
troduce several technical modiﬁcations in order to improve the agreement between the outcome of
this model and that of existing experiments. Such improvements include more realistic initial states
for the second electron and an adequate treatment of the bound-state singularity which is present
in the saddle-point framework. Although the changes in question do not lead to a better agreement
with the experiments, they provide useful information about the inﬂuence of the initial states of
both electrons. Indeed, we show that the momentum distributions are very sensitive with respect to
spatially extended or localized wave functions, but are not considerably inﬂuenced by their shape.
Furthermore, the modiﬁcations performed in order to overcome the bound-state singularity do not
signiﬁcantly alter the momentum distributions, apart from a minor suppression in the region of
small momenta.

INTRODUCTION

Within the last few years, nonsequential double ioniza-
tion in strong, linearly polarized laser ﬁelds has attracted
a great deal of attention, both experimentally and theo-
retically [1]. This interest has been triggered by the out-
come of experiments in which the momentum component
parallel to the laser ﬁeld polarization could be resolved,
either for the doubly charged ion [2], or for both electrons
[3]. Indeed, the observed features, namely two circular
regions along the parallel momenta p1k = p2k peaked at
p1k = p2k =
Up, with Up the ponderomotive energy,
are a clear ﬁngerprint of electron-electron correlation,
and can be explained by a very simple, three-step rescat-
tering mechanism. Thereby, an electron leaves an atom
through tunneling ionization (the “ﬁrst step”), propa-
gates in the continuum, being accelerated by the ﬁeld
(the “second step”), and recollides inelastically with its
parent ion (the “third step”). In this collision, it transfers
part of its kinetic energy to a second electron, which is
then released. Similar physical mechanisms are present
in a wide variety of phenomena occurring in the con-
text of atoms in strong laser ﬁelds, such as high-order
harmonic generation [4, 5] and above-threshold ioniza-
tion [6, 7], within classical [4, 6] and quantum-mechanical
[5, 7] frameworks.

p

From the theoretical point of view, there exist mod-
els, both classical [8, 9, 10] and quantum-mechanical
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], based on such a mechanism,
which qualitatively reproduce the above-mentioned fea-
tures. They leave, however, several open questions. A
very intriguing fact is that, for instance, a very good
agreement with the experiments is obtained if the inter-
action through which the ﬁrst electron is dislodged is of
contact type, and if no Coulomb repulsion is taken into
account in the ﬁnal electron states. This agreement wors-

ens if this interaction is modeled in a more reﬁned way,
considering either a more realistic, Coulomb-type inter-
action, or ﬁnal-state electron-electron repulsion. Speciﬁ-
cally, in recent publications, such eﬀects have been inves-
tigated in detail using both an S-Matrix computation and
a classical ensemble model, and have been interpreted in
terms of phase-space and dynamical eﬀects [15, 16]. This
analysis has been performed within the Strong- Field Ap-
proximation (SFA) [18], which mainly consists in neglect-
ing the binding potential in the propagation of the elec-
tron in the continuum, the laser ﬁeld when the electron is
bound or at the rescattering, and the internal structure of
the atom in question. We considered that the momentum
components perpendicular to the laser ﬁeld polarization
are either arbitrary or limited to ﬁnite ranges.

In [16] we also found that the inﬂuence of the type
of electron-electron rescattering, as well as of ﬁnal-state
Coulomb repulsion, is most pronounced if both transverse
momenta are kept small. Furthermore, we have shown
that a broadening in the momentum distributions in the
direction perpendicular to p1k = p2k is not necessarily
a ﬁngerprint of electron-electron repulsion, and may be
caused by phase-space eﬀects. Such investigations have
been motivated by recent experiments, in which one of
the electron momenta was resolved [19]. Therein, a simi-
lar broadening has been observed, and attributed to ﬁnal-
state Coulomb repulsion.

In the quantum-mechanical framework, the NSDI tran-
sition amplitude is written as a ﬁve-dimensional integral,
with a time-dependent action and comparatively slowly
varying prefactors. Such an integral is then solved using
saddle-point methods. Apart from being less demand-
ing than evaluating such an integral numerically [11, 12],
or solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation [20],
these methods provide a clear space-time picture of the
physical process in question, and are closely related to
Feynman path integral methods. In particular, the re-

sults are interpreted in terms of the so-called“quantum
orbits”. Such orbits can be related to the orbits of classi-
cal electrons in the continuum, and have been extensively
used within the context of above-threshold ionization and
high-order harmonic generation [21] as well as, more re-
cently, nonsequential double ionization [14, 15, 16, 17].

The fact that, in [15, 16], the crudest approximation
yields the best agreement with the experiments, seems
to indicate that the presence of the residual ion, which
is not taken into account, screens both the long-range
interaction which frees the second electron and the ﬁnal-
state repulsion. This suggests that the presence of the
ionic binding potential in the physical steps describing
nonsequential double ionization, i.e., tunneling, propaga-
tion and electron-impact ionization, should somehow be
incorporated. Indeed, in recent studies, it was found that
Coulomb focusing considerably inﬂuences the NSDI yield
[22].

Furthermore, it may as well be that an additional ap-
proximation performed in [15, 16] for the contact interac-
tion, namely to assume that it takes place at the origin of
the coordinate system, aﬀects the shape of the momen-
tum distributions, and contributes to the good agreement
between theory and experiments in this case. Physically,
this means that the spatial extension of the wave function
of the second electron is neglected. Such an approxima-
tion has not been performed in the computations for the
Coulomb interaction dicussed in [15, 16], and, up to the
present date, there exist no systematic studies of its in-
ﬂuence in the context of NSDI.

In this paper, we take such eﬀects into account in the
simplest possible ways. First, we assume that both elec-
trons are initially in hydrogenic 2p and in 3p states, in-
stead of in s states, as previously done [14, 15, 16, 17].
One should note that, in contrast to Helium, for which s
states are more appropriate, p states yield a more realis-
tic description of the outer-shell electrons in neon and ar-
gon, respectively. Since the two latter species are used in
most experiments, the choice of p states is justiﬁed. This
is included in the transition amplitude as a form factor,
and does not modify the saddle-point equations. In both
p and s - state cases, we consider that the bound-state
wave function of the second electron is either localized at
the origin or extends over a ﬁnite spatial range, for the
contact and Coulomb interactions.

A further improvement consists in overcoming the
bound-state singularity, which is present in the saddle-
point framework, and which has not been addressed in
[15, 16]. For this purpose, we use a slightly modiﬁed
action, with respect to that considered in [15, 16], so
that the tunneling process and the propagation of both
electrons in the continuum is altered. In particular, we
perform a systematic analysis of how such corrections in-
ﬂuence several features in the momentum distributions,
such as their shapes, the cutoﬀ energies or the contribu-
tions from diﬀerent types of orbits to the yield.

The manuscript is organized as following. In Sec. II,
we provide the necessary theoretical background for un-

IV, we present our results, and, ﬁnally, in Sec. V we state
our conclusions.

[14, 15, 16]. Then, at the time t′, the ﬁrst electron is re-
(cid:12)
leased through tunneling ionization, whereas the second
electron remains bound. Subsequently, the ﬁrst electron
propagates in the continuum from t′ to t, gaining energy
from the ﬁeld. At this latter time, it collides inelasti-
cally with its parent ion, dislodging the second electron.
The ﬁnal electron state is taken either as the product
state of one-electron Volkov states, or as a two-electron
Volkov state, with asymptotic momenta p1 and p2. The
former and the latter case corresponds to the absence or
presence of electron-electron repulsion in the ﬁnal states,
respectively. In this paper, we will concentrate on uncor-
related ﬁnal states. For discussions of the inﬂuence of
ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion we refer to [11, 15, 16]. In
Eq. (1), the Volkov states are taken in the length gauge.
We use atomic units throughout.

respectively. The binding potential V (r1) will be taken
to be of Coulomb type, and the interaction V12(r2, r1)
through which the second electron is released will be cho-
sen to be of contact or Coulomb type. The initial state
ψ(1)
0 (r1) of the ﬁrst electron at the moment of its ioniza-
tion will be taken as a hydrogenic s or p state, and the
wave function ψ(2)
0 (r2) of the second electron at the mo-
ment of its release is either chosen as a hydrogenic state,
or a Dirac delta state localized at r2 = 0.

B. Saddle-point analysis

For low enough frequencies and high enough laser in-
tensities, Eq. (2) can be solved to a good approximation
by the steepest descent method. Thus, we must deter-
mine k, t′ and t such that S(t, t′, pn, k) (n = 1, 2) is
stationary, i.e., that its partial derivatives with respect
to these variables vanish. This condition yields the equa-
tions

Eq. (8) gives the energy conservation during tunneling

has no real solution. Consequently, t, t′ and k are com-

a classical electron leaving the origin of the coordinate
system with vanishing drift velocity. Eq. (9) expresses
energy conservation at t, in an inelastic rescattering pro-
cess in which the ﬁrst electron gives part of its kinetic
energy to the second electron, so that it can overcome
the second ionization potential and reach the continuum.
Finally, Eq. (10) yields the intermediate electron momen-
tum constrained by the condition that the ﬁrst electron
returns to the site of its release. The saddles determined
by Eqs. (8)-(10) always occur in pairs that nearly coa-
lesce at the boundaries of the energy region for which the
rescattering process is classically allowed. Such a bound-
ary causes the yield to decay exponentially, leading to
sharp cutoﬀs in the momentum distributions. If written
in terms of the momentum components parallel and per-
pendicular to the laser ﬁeld polarization, Eq. (9) reads

The above-discussed saddle-point approximation is
only valid for well-isolated saddles. This does not hold

near the boundaries of the classically allowed region, i.e.,
near the cutoﬀs, where the pairs of saddles nearly coa-
lesce. Furthermore, beyond the classical cutoﬀs, one of
the saddles yields exponentially increasing and therefore
unphysical results, and must be discarded. This causes
cusps in the cutoﬀ region, which are particularly prob-
lematic for non-sequential double ionization (see, e.g.,
[14] for a discussion of this problem).

In this paper, we will use a more general, uniform ap-
proximation [26], which has been successfully applied in
[24] to above-threshold ionization, in [25] to high-order
harmonic generation, and in [14, 15, 16, 17] to NSDI,
and whose only validity requirement is that the saddles
occur in pairs. Within this approximation, for each pair
of trajectories, the transition amplitude in the energy
region for which electron-impact ionization is classically
allowed is given by

In the classically forbidden region, i.e., beyond the cut-
oﬀs, one of the saddles must be left out of the contour.
For that purpose, one must take an appropriate func-
tional branch of the Bessel functions, which will be cho-
sen by imposing a smooth functional behavior at a Stokes
transition. In the speciﬁc context of this paper, this tran-
sition marks a change in the asymptotic expansion of a
function [23], and occurs at

Re Sp(ti, t′

i, ki) = Re Sp(tj, t′

j, kj).

(15)

For nonsequential double ionization, such transitions
roughly coincide with the maximum and minimum clas-
sically allowed momenta, respectively. In the classically
forbidden region the transition amplitude reads

Equations (14) and (16) should be matched at the Stokes
transitions. In the limit of well-isolated saddles, i.e., for
1, the standard saddle-point approximation is re-

covered from Eqs. (14) and (16). More details about this
approximation are given in [24, 26, 27].

and second atomic ionization potential, respectively. In
most experiments, however, species such as neon and ar-
gon are used, for which the outer-shell electrons are in 2p
and 3p states, respectively. For this reason, such states
should provide a more realistic modeling of laser-induced
nonsequential doube ionization. For symmetry reasons,
only the states with magnetic quantum number m = 0
will contribute to the yield.

(a), (b) and (c), both electrons are initially bound in a 1s, 2p,

in part (d), the ﬁrst electron is initially in a 1s state and the
wave function of the second electron is localized at r2 = 0. In
all situations (even for the 3p - state case), the atomic species
was taken to be neon (

by the diﬀerent initial states. The transverse momenta have

The inﬂuence of such form factors on the electron mo-
mentum distributions is shown in Fig. 2. Apart from
p2|| caused by the spa-
the broadening along p1|| =
tial extent of the bound-state wave functions (c.f. Sec.
III A), the distributions exhibit maxima near the axis
p1|| = 0 or p2|| = 0. Such maxima are due to the factor

the Coulomb-type interaction, which is large for pn ≃
Since, to ﬁrst approximation, contributions from regions
of small k dominate the yield, one expects maxima in
momentum regions where either p1 or p2 are small.

Furthermore, as compared to the yields obtained using
a Coulomb-type interaction and 1s-states, there exists
a small additional broadening in the distributions, with
respect to the diagonal p1|| = p2||, as well as an increase in
the contributions from regions where such momenta are
small. Such eﬀects get more pronounced as the principal
quantum number increases, as shown in Figs. 2.(b) and
2.(c). This broadening is not speciﬁc to p states, and
occurs due to the fact that the initial electronic bound
states extend over a larger spatial region, as the principal
quantum number increases.

However, such modiﬁcations do not alter the distribu-
tions in a signiﬁcant way. More extreme changes occur,
for instance, if a contact-type interaction, i.e., Eq. (22),
is taken into account. Still, less localized bound states
for both electrons will cause a broadening in the momen-
tum distributions. If the second-electron wave function
is localized at the origin, the form factor (30) reduces to

Vpn,k

∼

k]2 + p1 ↔

p2.

[p1 −

The distributions for the latter form factor are displayed
in Fig. 2.(d). In the ﬁgure, one observes a considerable
reduction of the broadening along the anti-diagonal p1|| =
p2||. However, the distributions still exhibit the two
−
sets of maxima near the axis p1|| = 0 or p2|| = 0. This
is expected, since such maxima are a ﬁngerprint of the
Coulomb interaction.

The results in this section show that the shapes of the
momentum distributions in NSDI are not only inﬂuenced
by the type of interaction by which the second electron is
disloged but, additionally, depend on the spatial exten-
sion of the wave function of the state where it is initially
bound.
In fact, radically diﬀerent shapes are observed
if this wave function is either taken to be localized at
r2 = 0 or exponentially decaying. This is true both for a
contact- and a Coulomb-type interaction (c.f. Figs. 1.(d)
and 2.(d)).

On the other hand, if diﬀerent initial states are taken,
for the same type of interaction, there are no signiﬁcant
changes in the shapes of the distributions as long as such
states extend over a ﬁnite spatial range. This is explicitly
seen by comparing yields obtained using bound states
with diﬀerent principal quantum numbers. This is re-
lated to the fact that the wave functions (19)-(21) were
chosen such that the bound-state energy always corre-
sponds to the second ionization potential. Hence, even if

FIG. 2: Electron momentum distributions computed using a
Coulomb-type interaction, as functions of the electron mo-
mentum components parallel to the laser-ﬁeld polarization.
The ﬁeld and atomic parameters are the same as in Fig. 1.
In panels (a), (b) and (c), both electrons are taken to be ini-
tially in a 1s, 2p, and 3p state, respectively, whereas in panel
(d) the ﬁrst electron is in a 1s state, while the spatial ex-
tension of the bound-state wave function has been neglected.
The transverse momenta have been integrated over.

their shape changes, the spatial extension of such wave
functions is roughly the same.

It is still, however, quite puzzling that the best agree-
ment with the experimental ﬁndings occurs for the crud-
est approximations, both for the interaction and the ini-
tial bound-state wave function, i.e., for a contact-type
interaction and a wave function localized at r2 = 0.
Indeed, taking either a more realistic type of electron-
electron interaction, spatially extended bound states, or,
still, bound states which are, in principle, a more reﬁned
description of the outer-shell electrons, only worsens the
agreement between experiment and theory.

If the main physical mechanism of NSDI is electron-
impact ionization, there exist two main possibilities for
explaining this discrepancy. Either the second electron is
bound in highly localized states and collide through an
eﬀective short-range interaction, as the present results
suggest, or the tunneling ionization, as well as the elec-
tron propagation in the continuum, must be improved.
The ﬁrst issue may be addressed by including the inﬂu-
ence of the residual ion in the process, whereas the second
issue may be dealt with in several ways. For instance, in
the subsequent section, we will consider corrections of a
more fundamental nature, which alter the semiclassical
action and thus the orbits of the electrons.

IV. TREATMENT OF THE BOUND-STATE
SINGULARITY

Up to the present section, we have implicitly assumed
that the form factors Vp1,p2,k and Vk,0 are free of sin-
gularities and slowly varying in comparison to the time-
dependent action. However, this is not always true. In-
deed, in the saddle-point framework, the form factor Vk,0
is singular if the electron is initially in a state described
by an exponentially decaying wave function, such as Eqs.
(19)-(21). More speciﬁcally, in this case,

Vk,0 ∝

f (k + A(t′))
[k + A(t′)]2 + 2

n ,

(32)

(cid:16)

E01|
|
(cid:17)

for which the denominator vanishes, according to Eq. (8).
Due to this singularity, this form factor does not vary
slowly with respect to the semi-classical action (3), and
thus must be incorporated in the exponent. Therefore,
we take the modiﬁed action

˜S(t, t′, pn, k) = S(t, t′, pi, k)

i ln [Vk,0]

(33)

−

in the transition amplitude (2). This causes a change in
the ﬁrst and third saddle-point equations, which will de-
pend on the initial bound state in question. In particular,
we will consider that the ﬁrst electron is initially in the
hydrogenic states 1s, 2p, and 3p. This is a legitimate as-
sumption, since the binding potential of a neutral atom,
from which the ﬁrst electron tunnels out, is of long-range
type. For the states 1s, 2p, and 3p, Vk,0 reads

respectively, where ζ(k, t′) =

which depends on the initial bound state. Thus, there is
an eﬀective shift in the ionization potential at the tun-
neling times, and a modiﬁcation in the return condition.

−

7

Consequently, there is change in the orbits. Apart from
that, from the technical point of view, the transition am-
plitude is no longer reducible to a two-dimensional inte-
gral, so that the problem is far more cumbersome.

The modiﬁcations in the equation describing tunnel-
ing ionization allow the existence of solutions for which
= 0. This did not occur in Eq. (8), for which this
Re[v]
quantity was purely imaginary, and, physically, means
that there are in principle changes, maybe even enhance-
ments, in the probability that the ﬁrst electron tunnels
out at t′.

Furthermore, Eq. (38), if written in terms of the com-
ponents of the intermediate momentum k parallel and
perpendicular to the laser ﬁeld polarization, has, apart
from the trivial solution k⊥ = 0, additional solutions for
which k⊥ 6
= 0. Thus, in principle, the ﬁrst electron may
have a non-vanishing drift velocity component transverse
to the laser-ﬁeld polarization. We regard this possibility,
however, as non-physical, and therefore will mainly con-
centrate on the case of vanishing k⊥. Despite of that, the
results obtained for nonvanishing k⊥will be brieﬂy dis-
cussed in Sec. IV B. For the return condition (9) this is
not possible and k⊥ is always vanishing. In the follow-
ing, we will investigate how the corrections in the action
aﬀect the momentum distributions.

A. Vanishing k⊥

In this section, we will consider that the ﬁrst elec-
tron has vanishing intermediate momentum components
k⊥. Physically, this means that the dynamics of NSDI
is mainly taking place along the laser ﬁeld polarization,
which is the intuitively expected situation. In Fig. 3, we
present the electron momentum distributions computed
employing the modiﬁed saddle-point equations and the
action (33), for the same initial states and types of as
in Figs. 1 and a contact-type interaction.
In general,
the distributions in Fig. 3 are very similar to the former
ones, with, however, a suppression in the region of small
parallel momenta. This is true even if diﬀerent correc-
tions are taken into account, as it is the case if the ﬁrst
electron is initially in a 1s, 2p and 3p state (Figs. 3.(a),
3.(b) and 3.(c), respectively).
In the speciﬁc case of a
localized bound-state wave function for the second elec-
tron, there is also a minor displacement of the maxima
towards smaller parallel momenta(c.f. Fig. 3(d)).

The suppression persists if the second electron is re-
leased by a Coulomb-type interaction, as shown in Fig.
4. Speciﬁcally for this interaction, the corrections lead
to a suppression of the secondary maxima in the small-
momentum region, which were present in Fig. 2.

In the following, we will analyze these diﬀerences in
terms of the so-called quantum orbits, obtained by solv-
ing the saddle point equations. We will consider both
the saddle-point equations in the presence and absence
of corrections to the bound-state singularity, i.e., Eqs.
(37), (9) and (38), and (8)-(10), respectively. We re-

for the same ﬁeld and atomic parameters as in the previous
ﬁgures. We introduce corrections to the bound-state singu-
larity by employing the modiﬁed action (33) and saddle-point
equations, taking the solutions displayed in Figs. 6.(a) and
6.(c). In panels (a), (b) and (c), both electrons are taken to
be initially in a 1s, in a 2p, and in a 3p state, respectively,
whereas in panel (d) the ﬁrst electron is initially in a 1s state,
while the spatial extension of the bound-state wave function
of the second electron has been neglected. The transverse
momenta have been integrated over.

strict ourselves to vanishing ﬁnal transverse momenta
and longitudinal momentum components along the diag-
onal p|| = p1|| = p2||. For this particular case, the energy
region for which electron-impact ionization is classically
allowed is most extense.

In Fig. 5, we display the solutions of the saddle-point
equations for the rescattering times t and the interme-
diate momentum k. The upper and lower panels in the
ﬁgure give the real and imaginary parts of such variables,
respectively. The real parts of t and k correspond to the
solutions of the equations of motion of a classical elec-
tron in an external laser ﬁeld, and almost merge at two
distinct parallel momenta. These momenta are related
to the maximal and minimal energy for which the second
electron is able to overcome
. Beyond such momenta,
E02|
|
there are cutoﬀs in the distributions, and the yield de-
cays exponentially. The imaginary parts of such variables
are in a sense a measure of a particular physical pro-
cess being classically allowed and forbidden. Indeed, the
fact that

the minimal and maximal allowed momenta are a conse-

increase exponentially. Interestingly, both the real and
imaginary parts of such variables, as well as the cutoﬀ
momenta, remain practically inaltered upon the changes
introduced in this section. This is not obvious, since the
bound-state corrections in question alter the return con-
dition [c.f. Eq.(38)].

and

There exist, however, modiﬁcations in the tunneling
times t′, which are explicitly shown in Fig. 6. Specif-
ically, the corrections in the tunneling condition, which
leads to Eq. (37), cause a splitting in the solutions of
Eq. (8). This follows from the fact that small variations
in the stationary-action trajectories contributes quadrat-
ically to S(t, t′, pn, k) and Vk,0, so that ˜S(t, t′, pn, k) at-
tains two stationary trajectories for each of the former
ones. Strictly speaking, a similar splitting also occurs
for k and t. In practice, however, the diﬀerence between
the two diﬀerent sets of solutions is vanishingly small,
and thus not noticeable in Fig. 5. The diﬀerent sets
of solutions are depicted in Figs. 6(a) and 6.(c), and
6.(b) and 6(d), respectively. The real parts Re[t′] ex-

orbits and small momenta and eventually disappear as
the upper cutoﬀ is approached. Depending on the type
of correction, such times either distance themselves from,
or become slightly closer to the peak-ﬁeld times (Figs.
6.(a) and 6.(b), respectively). Thus, one could expect an
enhancement in the contributions from the shorter orbits
near the origin of the
plane, in the former case,
and a suppression in the latter case. However, we have
used the solutions in Fig. 6.(b) and (d) for computing
the contour plots in Figs. 3 and 4, and obtained a sup-
pression in the yield. This is a clear indication that the
changes in Im[t′] and in the time-dependent action play
a more important role than those in Re[t′].

In Figs. 6.(c) and 6.(d), we present the imaginary parts
of t′, which clearly shift towards smaller, and larger val-
ues, respectively, when the corrections ς(k, t′) are taken
into account. The higher the initial state lies, the larger
such shifts are. Physically, there exists a correspondence
between such imaginary parts and the probability that
the ﬁrst electron tunnels out and reaches the contin-
uum. This means that, by using a slightly modiﬁed ac-
tion in order to overcome the Coulomb singularity, one
is changing the eﬀective potential barrier at t′ for the
ﬁrst electron. In general, such a barrier has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the distributions. Indeed, recently, we have
shown, within the context of nonsequential double ion-

of the contributions of a particular orbit or set of orbits

to the yield is highly dependent on

this quantity is, the larger is the tunneling probability for
the ﬁrst electron [17]. As a direct consequence, contri-

butions from orbits with small
, i.e., with a large

case, however, since both orbits are being equally shifted,
this should not inﬂuence the distributions qualitatively.
One should note that, even in the momentum region for

which electron-impact ionization is allowed,

fact that tunneling ionization is a classically forbidden
process.

Subsequently, we compute the counterparts of Fig. 3
and 4 (Figs. 7 and 8) using the solutions displayed in
Fig. 6.(b) and 6.(d). Also in this case, in general, there
is a suppression in the yield in the region of small parallel
momenta, with, however, a slightly diﬀerent substructure
in the Coulomb-interaction case.

that the ﬁrst electron, during tunneling ionization and
when it returns, is being deviated from its original di-
rection. Although such an eﬀect is unphysical, we will
brieﬂy discuss its consequences. For that purpose, we
will consider the simplest corrections to the bound-state
singularity discussed in this paper, namely those for 1s
initial states.

out corrections, this does not hold and only the trivial
solution exists.

Fig. 8 depicts the tunneling and rescattering times
for this case, together with the perpendicular and par-
allel components of k. The real parts of such variables
correspond, as in the previous cases, to a longer and a
shorter orbit. The momenta, however, for which such
orbits nearly coalesce, are radically diﬀerent from those
in the previous cases discussed in this paper. This is
due to the fact that a nonvanishing k⊥ also aﬀects the
rescattering condition (9), which now reads

FIG. 9: Tunneling [Panels (a) and (e)] and rescattering times
[Panels (b) and (f)], together with the parallel [Panels (c) and
(g)] and perpendicular components of the intermediate mo-
mentum k [Panels (d) and (h)], as functions of the parallel
momentum p|| along the diagonal p1|| = p2||. The ﬁnal trans-
verse momenta pn⊥(n = 1, 2) are taken to be vanishing. The
real and imaginary parts of such quantities are displayed in
the upper [(a), (b), (c) and (d)] and lower [(e), (f), (g) and
(h)] panels, respectively. The ﬁeld and atomic parameters
are the same as in the previous ﬁgure. The corrected and
uncorrected yields are given by the black and gray curves in
the ﬁgure, respectively. The tunneling and rescattering times
are multiplied by ω and the intermediate momenta divided
by √ω, respectively, so that a direct comparison with Figs. 5
and 6 can be performed.

ing the same pattern as previously, growing vary rapidly
at the momenta for which the real parts approach each
other, and remaining nearly constant inbetween. Inter-
estingly, Im[t′] is vanishing in this region. This feature
is in clear contradiction with the fact that tunneling is a
process which is always forbidden, and therefore requires
a nonvanishing Im[t′] (c.f. Fig. 5.(d)). For this reason,
we will not use solutions with nonvanishing k⊥ for com-
puting electron momentum distributions.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we investigate the inﬂuence of the ini-
tial bound-state wave functions for the ﬁrst and sec-
ond bound electrons, on the diﬀerential electron momen-
tum distributions for laser-induced nonsequential ioniza-
tion. We employ a quantum-mechanical S-Matrix model
within the Strong-Field Approximation, in which this
phenomenon is described as the inelastic collision of the
ﬁrst electron with its parent ion. The second electron
is then freed by electron-impact ionization. In particu-
lar, we compute the NSDI transition amplitudes using a
uniform approximation, which is closely related to path-
integral methods, and interpret the results in terms of
the so-called ”quantum orbits”. Such orbits are closely
related to the orbits of classical electrons recolliding with

11

their parent ion. We consider that the second electron
is dislodged by a contact- and Coulomb-type interaction,
and assume that both electron are initially in a 1s, 2p or
3p hydrogenic state. As an additional case, we consider
that the ﬁrst electron is initially bound in a 1s state, and
that the initial wave function of the second electron is
localized at r2 = 0.

Concerning the initial bound-state wave function of
the second electron, our results show that the NSDI
momentum distributions are very sensitive to its spa-

tially extended wave function causes a broadening in the
electron momentum distribuitons along the anti-diagonal
p1|| =
p2||, even if the second electron is dislodged by a
contact-type interaction. Circular-shaped distributions,
as reported in [15, 16] and observed in experiments [1, 3]
are only obtained for a contact-type interaction under
the additional condition that the bound-state wave func-
tion is localized at the origin of the coordinate system,
i.e., at r2 = 0. In addition to this broadening, if the sec-
ond electron is released by a Coulomb-type interaction,
there is an enhancement in the contributions near the
axis p1|| = 0 or p2|| = 0.

All the distributions investigated in this article, how-
ever, change in a less radical fashion if the second electron
is taken to be in a a 1s, 2p or 3p hydrogenic state, as long
as they exhibit a spatial extension. In fact, although spe-
ciﬁc changes are observed, such as an additional substruc-
ture for a Coulomb-type interaction, or more localized
distributions for a contact-type interaction, the overall
shapes of such distributions remains similar.

Furthermore, if the form factor Vk,0, which, within our
model, contains all the inﬂuence of the initial state of
the ﬁrst electron, is incorporated in the time-dependent
action, the only noticeable eﬀect is a suppression in the
yield, for regions of small parallel momenta. Indeed, the
distributions retain their shapes even if the saddle-point
equations are modiﬁed in this way. Such changes have
been introduced in order to correct a singularity which
exists for such the prefactor Vk,0, within the saddle-point
framwork, if the initial bound state is exponentially de-
caying.

Finally, it is very intriguing that the most simpliﬁed
model, i.e., a contact-type interaction localized at the ori-
gin of the coordinate system, yields the best agreements

cal modiﬁcations considered in this paper, which aimed
at making the model more realistic, either worsened this
agreement, or had almost no inﬂuence on the momen-
tum distributions. Similar conclusions have also been ob-
tained in previous studies, in which ﬁnal-state electron-
electron repulsion has been incorporated [15, 16].
In
[15, 16], we raised the hypotheses that the residual ion
might be screening both the long-range of the Coulomb
interaction, or the ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion. Ac-
cording to the results of this paper, it appears that ef-
fects such as Coulomb focusing, which, again, owes its
existence to the presence of the ion, may be compensat-

wave functions. Such a broadening occurs in the direc-

tion of the anti-diagonal p1|| =
if a contact-type interaction releases the second electron.
Deﬁnite statements on this issue, however, require either
incorporating such an ion in our model or a theoretical
approach beyond the Strong-Field Approximation.

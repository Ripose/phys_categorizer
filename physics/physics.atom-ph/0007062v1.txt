INTRODUCTION

Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental feature of modern descriptions of nature.
Lorentz transformations include both spatial rotations and boosts. Therefore, experi-
mental investigations of rotation symmetry provide important tests of the framework
of the standard model of particle physics and single-metric theories of gravity [1].

In particular, the minimal SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) standard model successfully de-
scribes particle phenomenology, but is believed to be the low energy limit of a more
fundamental theory that incorporates gravity. While the fundamental theory should re-
main invariant under Lorentz transformations, spontaneous symmetry-breaking could
result at the level of the standard model in violations of local Lorentz invariance (LLI)
and CPT (symmetry under simultaneous application of Charge conjugation, Parity
inversion, and Time reversal) [2].

Clock comparisons provide sensitive tests of rotation invariance and hence Lorentz
symmetry by bounding the frequency variation of a given clock as its orientation
changes, e.g., with respect to the ﬁxed stars [3]. In practice, the most precise limits
are obtained by comparing the frequencies of two co-located clocks as they rotate with
the Earth (see Fig. 1). Atomic clocks are typically used, involving the electromagnetic
signals emitted or absorbed on hyperﬁne or Zeeman transitions.

We report preliminary results from two new atomic clock tests of LLI and CPT:

(1) Using a two-species 129Xe/3He Zeeman maser [4–6] we have placed a limit on CPT
and LLI violation of the neutron of nearly 10−31 GeV, improving by about a factor
of three on the bound set by the most sensitive past clock comparison [7,8]. With
further data-taking, we expect another factor of two improvement in sensitivity.

(2) We have also employed atomic hydrogen masers to set an improved clean limit

on LLI/CPT violation of the proton, at the level of nearly 10−27 GeV.

model extension described in [3,9–
17] admits Lorentz-violating cou-
plings of noble gas nuclei and hy-
drogen atoms to expectation val-
ues of tensor ﬁelds. (Some of these
couplings also violate CPT.) Each
of the tensor ﬁelds may have an
independent magnitude and orien-
tation in space, to be limited by
experiment. The background ar-
rows in this ﬁgure illustrate one
such ﬁeld.

MOTIVATION

Our atomic clock comparisons are motivated by a standard model extension de-
veloped by Kosteleck´y and others [3, 9–17]. This theoretical framework accommodates
possible spontaneous violation of local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and CPT symmetry,
which may occur in a fundamental theory combining the standard model with gravity.
For example, this might occur in string theory [18]. The standard model extension is
quite general:
it emerges as the low-energy limit of any underlying theory that gen-
erates the standard model and contains spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation [19].
The extension retains the usual gauge structure and power-counting renormalizability
of the standard model. It also has many other desirable properties, including energy-
momentum conservation, observer Lorentz covariance, conventional quantization, and
hermiticity. Microcausality and energy positivity are expected.

This well-motivated theoretical framework suggests that small, low-energy sig-
nals of LLI and CPT violation may be detectable in high-precision experiments. The
dimensionless suppression factor for such eﬀects would likely be the ratio of the low-
energy scale to the Planck scale, perhaps combined with dimensionless coupling con-
stants [3, 9–19]. A key feature of the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y et al.
is that it is at the level of the known elementary particles, and thus enables quanti-
tative comparison of a wide array of tests of Lorentz symmetry. In recent work the
standard model extension has been used to quantify bounds on LLI and CPT vio-
lation from measurements of neutral meson oscillations [9]; tests of QED in Penning
traps [10]; photon birefringence in the vacuum [11,12]; baryogenesis [13]; hydrogen and
antihydrogen spectroscopy [14]; experiments with muons [15]; a spin-polarized torsion

Recent experimental work motivated by this standard model extension includes Pen-
ning trap tests by Gabrielse et al. on the antiproton and H− [20], and by Dehmelt
et al. on the electron and positron [21, 22], which place improved limits on CPT and
LLI violation in these systems. Also, a re-analysis by Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel,
and co-workers of existing data from the “E¨ot-Wash II” spin-polarized torsion pendu-
lum [23, 24] sets the most stringent bound to date on CPT and LLI violation of the
electron: approximately 10−29 GeV [25].

129Xe/3He MASER TEST OF CPT AND LORENTZ SYMMETRY

The design and operation of the two-species 129Xe/3He maser has been discussed
in recent publications [4–6]. (See the schematic in Fig. 2.) Two dense, co-habitating
ensembles of 3He and 129Xe atoms perform continuous and simultaneous maser oscilla-
tions on their respective nuclear spin 1/2 Zeeman transitions at approximately 4.9 kHz
for 3He and 1.7 kHz for 129Xe in a static magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 gauss. This two-species
maser operation can be maintained indeﬁnitely. The population inversion for both
maser ensembles is created by spin exchange collisions between the noble gas atoms
and optically-pumped Rb vapor [26]. The 129Xe/3He maser has two chambers, one
acting as the spin exchange “pump bulb” and the other serving as the “maser bulb”.
This two chamber conﬁguration permits the combination of physical conditions neces-
sary for a high ﬂux of spin-polarized noble gas atoms into the maser bulb, while also
maintaining 3He and 129Xe maser oscillations with good frequency stability:
100 nHz
stability is typical for measurement intervals of ∼ 1 hour [6]. (A single-bulb 129Xe/3He
maser does not provide good frequency stability because of the large Fermi contact
shift of the 129Xe Zeeman frequency caused by 129Xe-Rb collisions [27].) Either of the
noble gas species can serve as a precision magnetometer to stabilize the system’s static
magnetic ﬁeld, while the other species is employed as a sensitive probe for LLI- and
CPT-violating interactions or other subtle physical inﬂuences. (For example, we are
also using the 129Xe/3He maser to search for a permanent electric dipole moment of
129Xe as a test of time reversal symmetry; hence the electric ﬁeld plates in Fig. 2.)

phase data residuals are shown for one sidereal day. Larmor precession and drift
terms have been removed, and the best-ﬁt sinusoid curve (with sidereal-day-period) is

We search for a signature of Lorentz violation by monitoring the relative phases
and Zeeman frequencies of the co-located 3He and 129Xe masers as the laboratory
reference frame rotates with respect to the ﬁxed stars. We operate the system with the
quantization axis directed east-west in the earth’s reference frame, the 3He maser free-
running, and the 129Xe maser phase-locked to a signal derived from a hydrogen maser
in order to stabilize the magnetic ﬁeld. To leading order, the standard model extension
of Kosteleck´y et al. predicts that the Lorentz-violating frequency shifts for the 3He and
129Xe maser are the same size and sign [3]. Hence the possible Lorentz-violating eﬀect
would have the form:

δνLorentz = δνHe [γHe/γXe − 1]−1 ,

(1)

where δνLorentz is the frequency shift induced in the noble gas Zeeman transitions by
the Lorentz-violating interaction, δνHe is the observed limit to a frequency shift in
the free-running 3He maser with the period of a sidereal day (≈ 23.93 hours), and
γHe/γXe ≈ 2.75 is the ratio of gyromagnetic ratios for 3He and 129Xe.

We acquired data for this experiment over a period of 30 days in April, 1999
and 24 days in September, 1999.
(We are currently taking additional data.) We
reversed the main magnetic ﬁeld of the apparatus every ∼ 4 days to help distinguish
possible Lorentz-violating eﬀects from diurnal systematic variations. In addition, we
carefully assessed the eﬀectiveness of the 129Xe co-magnetometer, and found that it
provides excellent isolation from possible diurnally-varying ambient magnetic ﬁelds,
which would not average away with ﬁeld reversals. Furthermore, the relative phase
between the solar and sidereal day evolved almost 5π/6 radians between April and
September; hence diurnal systematic eﬀects from any source would be reduced by
averaging the results from the two existing measurement sets.

We analyzed each day’s data in the April and September measurement sets and
determined the amplitude and phase of any sidereal-day-period variation in the free-
running 3He maser frequency.
(See Fig. 3 for an example of one day’s data.) We
employed a linear least squares method to ﬁt the free-running maser phase vs. time
using a minimal model including: a constant (phase oﬀset); a linear term (Larmor
precession); and cosine and sine terms with sidereal day period. For each day’s data,
we included terms corresponding to quadratic and maser amplitude-induced phase drift
if they signiﬁcantly improved the reduced χ2 [28]. As a ﬁnal check, we added a faux
Lorentz-violating eﬀect of known phase and amplitude to the raw data and performed
the analysis as before. We considered our data reduction for a given sidereal day to be
successful if the synthetic physics was recovered and there was no signiﬁcant change in
the covariance matrix generated by the ﬁtting routine.

Using the April and September measurement sets, we found no statistically sig-
niﬁcant sidereal variation of the free-running 3He maser frequency. At the one-sigma
conﬁdence level, we determined a bound of approximately 80 nHz on δνLorentz , the mag-
nitude of a possible LLI- and CPT-violating eﬀect. Kosteleck´y and Lane report that
the nuclear Zeeman transitions of 129Xe and 3He are primarily sensitive to Lorentz-
violating couplings of the neutron, assuming the correctness of the Schmidt model of
the nuclei [3]. Thus our search for a sidereal-period frequency shift of the free-running
3He maser (δνHe) provides a bound to the following parameters characterizing the
magnitude of LLI/CPT violations in the standard model extension:

J, and ˜gn

Here J = X, Y denotes spatial indices in a non-rotating frame, with X and Y oriented
in a plane perpendicular to the Earth’s rotation axis and we have taken ¯h = c = 1.
The parameters ˜bn
D,J describe the strength of Lorentz-violating couplings of
the neutron to possible background tensor ﬁelds. ˜bn
D,J correspond to couplings
that violate both CPT and LLI, while ˜dn
J corresponds to a coupling that violates
LLI but not CPT. All three of these parameters are diﬀerent linear combinations of
fundamental parameters in the underlying relativistic Lagrangian of the standard model
extension [3, 9–16].

J and ˜gn

It is clear from Eqn. (2) that the 129Xe/3He clock comparison is primarily sensi-
tive to LLI/CPT violations associated with the neutron parameter ˜bn
J . Similarly, the
most precise previous search for LLI/CPT violations of the neutron, the 199Hg/133Cs
experiment of Lamoreaux, Hunter et al. [7, 8], also had principal sensitivity to ˜bn
J at
the following level [3]:

˜bn

J + {small terms}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(199Hg/133Cs).

(3)

In this case, the experimental limit, δνHg ,J , was a bound of 55 nHz (one-sigma) on a
sidereal-period variation of the 199Hg nuclear Zeeman frequency, with the 133Cs elec-
tronic Zeeman frequency serving as a co-magnetometer.

Therefore, in the context of the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y and co-
J to nearly

workers [3], our 129Xe/3He maser measurement improves the constraint on ˜bn

10−31 GeV, or about three times better than the 199Hg/133Cs clock comparison [7, 8].
Note that the ratio of this limit to the neutron mass (10−31GeV/mn ∼ 10−31) compares
favorably to the dimensionless suppression factor mn/MPlanck ∼ 10−19 that might be
expected to govern spontaneous symmetry breaking of LLI and CPT originating at the
Planck scale. We expect a factor of two improvement in the sensitivity to LLI/CPT-
violation with the completion of 129Xe/3He maser data taking in spring, 2000. We also
expect more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity using a new device
currently under development in our laboratory: the 21Ne/3He Zeeman maser.

HYDROGEN MASER TEST OF CPT AND LORENTZ SYMMETRY

The hydrogen maser is an established tool in precision tests of fundamental physics
[29]. Hydrogen masers operate on the ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne transition in the
ground state of atomic hydrogen [30]. Hydrogen molecules are dissociated into atoms
in an RF discharge, and the atoms are state selected via a hexapole magnet (Fig. 4).
The high ﬁeld seeking states, (F = 1, mF = +1, 0) are focused into a Teﬂon coated
cell which resides in a microwave cavity resonant with the ∆F = 1 transition at 1420
MHz. The F = 1, mF = 0 atoms are stimulated to make a transition to the F = 0
state by the ﬁeld of the cavity. A static magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1 milligauss is applied to
maintain the quantization axis of the H atoms.

The hydrogen transitions most sensitive to potential CPT and LLI violations are
the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman transitions. In the 0.6 mG static ﬁeld applied for these
measurements, the Zeeman frequency is νZ ≈ 850 Hz. We utilize a double resonance
technique to measure this frequency with a precision of ∼ 1 mHz [31]. We apply a
weak magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the static ﬁeld and oscillating at a frequency
close to the Zeeman transition. This audio-frequency driving ﬁeld couples the three
sublevels of the F = 1 manifold of the H atoms. Provided a population diﬀerence

exists between the mF = ±1 states, the energy of the mF = 0 state is altered by this
coupling, thus shifting the measured maser frequency in a carefully analyzed manner
[31] described by a dispersive shape (Fig. 5(a)). Importantly, the maser frequency is
unchanged when the driving ﬁeld is exactly equal to the Zeeman frequency. Therefore,
we determine the Zeeman frequency by measuring the driving ﬁeld frequency at which
the maser frequency in the presence of the driving ﬁeld is equal to the unperturbed
maser frequency.

The F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency is directly proportional to the static
magnetic ﬁeld, in the small-ﬁeld limit. Four layers of high permeability (µ-metal)
magnetic shields surround the maser (Fig. 4), screening external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations by
a factor of 32 000. Nevertheless, external magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations cause remnant
variations in the observed Zeeman frequency. As low frequency magnetic noise in the
neighborhood of this experiment is much larger during the day than late at night, the
measured Zeeman frequency could be preferentially shifted by this noise (at levels up to
∼ 0.5 Hz) with a 24 hour periodicity which is diﬃcult to distinguish from a true sidereal
signal in our relatively short data sample. Therefore, we employ an active stabilization
system to cancel such magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (Fig. 4). A ﬂuxgate magnetometer
placed as close to the maser cavity as possible controls large (8 ft. dia.) Helmholtz coils
surrounding the maser via a feedback loop to maintain a constant ambient ﬁeld. This
feedback loop reduces the ﬂuctuations at the sidereal frequency to below the equivalent
of 1 µHz on the Zeeman frequency at the location of the magnetometer.

The Zeeman frequency of a hydrogen maser was measured for 11 days in November,
1999. During this period, the maser remained in a closed, temperature controlled
room to reduce potential systematics from thermal drifts which might be expected to
have 24 hour periodicities. The feedback system also maintained a constant ambient
magnetic ﬁeld. Each Zeeman measurement took approximately 20 minutes to acquire
and was subsequently ﬁt to extract a Zeeman frequency (Fig. 5(a)). Also monitored
were maser amplitude, residual magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation, ambient temperature, and
current through the solenoidal coil which determines the Zeeman frequency (Fig. 4).

The data for all 11 days (Fig. 5(b)) were then ﬁt to extract the sidereal-period
sinusoidal variation of the Zeeman frequency. In addition to the sinusoid, piecewise
linear terms (whose slopes were allowed to vary independently for each day) were used
to model the slow remnant drift of the Zeeman frequency (roughly 250 mHz over 11
days). A one sigma limit was established for a sidereal-period variation of the hydrogen
F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency: δνH
Z ≤ 0.7 mHz. Expressed in terms of energy,
this is a shift in the Zeeman splitting of less than 3 · 10−27 GeV.

The hydrogen atom is directly sensitive to LLI and CPT violations of the pro-
ton and the electron. Following the notation of reference [14], one ﬁnds that a limit
on a sidereal-period modulation of the Zeeman frequency (δνH
Z ) provides a bound to
the following parameters characterizing the magnitude of LLI/CPT violations in the
standard model extension of Kosteleck´y and co-workers:

LLI but not CPT [14]. The subscript 3 in Eqn. (4) indicates the direction along the
quantization axis of the apparatus, which is vertical in the lab frame but rotates with
respect to the ﬁxed stars with the period of the sidereal day.

As noted above, a re-analysis by Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, and co-workers of
existing data from the “E¨ot-Wash II” spin-polarized torsion pendulum [23,24] sets the
most stringent bound to date on CPT and LLI violation of the electron: ˜be
J ≤ 10−29
GeV [25]. Therefore, in the context of the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y and
co-workers [3,14] the H maser measurement to date constrains LLI and CPT violations
of the proton parameter ˜bp
J ≤ 4 · 10−27 GeV at the one sigma level. This preliminary
limit is comparable to that derived from the 199Hg/133Cs experiment of Lamoreaux,
Hunter et al. [7,8] but in a much cleaner system (the hydrogen atom nucleus, a proton,
as opposed to the 199Hg and 133Cs nuclei). The experiment is in progress with more data
taking expected in early spring, 2000. Further studies of systematics will be performed
including reversal of the quantization axis as well as a change in the magnitude of the
applied ﬁeld.

CONCLUSIONS

Precision comparisons of atomic clocks provide sensitive tests of Lorentz and
CPT symmetries, thereby probing extensions to the standard model [3, 9–17] in which

D

these symmetries can be spontaneously broken. Measurements using the two-species
129Xe/3He Zeeman maser constrain violations of CPT and Lorentz symmetry of the
neutron at nearly the 10−31 GeV level. Measurements with atomic hydrogen masers
provide clean tests of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation of the proton at nearly the
10−27 GeV level. Improvements in both experiments are being pursued.

We investigate the light-induced frequency shift in the photoassociation spectrum (PAS), focusing on
the eﬀect of quantum correlations in the low-intensity limit. Contrary to the established semiclassical
red shift that depends linearly on intensity I, the presence of anomalous atom-pair correlations can
lead to a blue shift in the PAS proportional to √I.

Photoassociation (PA) occurs when two free atoms ab-
sorb a laser photon, thereby jumping from the two-atom
continuum to a bound molecular state. As it happens,
free-bound couplings necessarily introduce a shift to the
photoassociation spectrum (molecular binding energy),
which theory [1–3] and experiment [4,5] agree is to the
red and linear in light intensity. On the contrary, we
demonstrate that quantum correlations can, in the limit
of low light intensity, lead to a blue frequency shift pro-
portional to the square root of the PA laser intensity.

In coherent photoassociation, the initial atoms belong
to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and therefore so
will the molecules (MBEC). Coupling to the continuum
of noncondensate modes occurs because photodissocia-
tion of a zero-momentum (k = 0) MBEC molecule need
not take the atoms back to the k = 0 atomic conden-
sate, but may just as well end up with two atoms with
k), i.e., due to unwanted [6,7] or
opposite momenta (

In the limit of low light intensities, we conclude that
quantum correlations [C(ǫ)
= 0] lead to a continuum-
induced blue shift of the molecular binding energy δǫb ∝
ξ
In contrast, the semiclassical approximation
[C(ǫ) = 0] means that the time-evolution generator U
∝
ξ2, and the shift is red with δǫb ∝
I as expected [1–3].
A small and near-pure condensate is most likely neces-
sary to reveal a quantum-correlated light shift. Inciden-
tally, the same result applies to Feshbach-resonant atom-
molecule systems [11] in the limit of a narrow resonance.

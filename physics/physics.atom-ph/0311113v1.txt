Abstract

Photon trajectories in incoherent radiation trapping for Doppler and Lorentz line shapes un-

der complete frequency redistribution are shown to be generalized L´evy ﬂights. The respective

jump length (r) distributions display characteristic long tails. For the Lorentz line shape, the

Interest in distributions with long tails has increased over the last years, with intensive

search for such laws in real physical systems. The seminal works on these distributions

by L´evy and others in the 1930s [1] paved the way, but it was only relatively recently

that these distributions were shown to be applicable to the description of a number of

physical, biological and social phenomena [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In particular, trajectories regulated

by jump distributions with long tails, leading to L´evy (superdiﬀusive) ﬂights, have been

identiﬁed in a few cases, including particle motion in turbulent media [2, 3, 7], molecular

motion in microheterogeneous media [8], and the albatross ﬂight [9]. The purpose of this

Letter is to show that photon trajectories in incoherent radiation trapping, a basic and

common phenomenon in atomic and atmospheric physics, and in astrophysics, and under the

assumptions of Doppler, Voigt or Lorentz line shapes and complete frequency redistribution,

are superdiﬀusive ﬂights.

Although “the general trend nowadays is to put L´evy-type anomalous (super)diﬀusion on

a similar footing with normal, Brownian-type, diﬀusion” [10], the actual physical systems

that are some times invoked to justify the practical importance of L´evy ﬂights in physical

space tend to be somewhat marginal in physical research at large [3]. This contribution aims

to prove that the well known case of classical incoherent radiation trapping is a L´evy ﬂight

and, as far as the authors can judge, constitute both the simplest and the most well deﬁned

L´evy ﬂight found up to now. In addition, radiation trapping has a major role in ﬂuorescent

lamps that represent a multi-billion dollar market. Due to the widespread use of these lamps

for general lighting, even small improvements in lamp eﬃciency can have a dramatic eﬀect

in world-wide energy consumption. “Rough estimates show that if the eﬃciency of discharge

lamps could be increased by only 1 %, this would lead to savings of 109 kWh per year!” [11].

This could make trapping the economically most relevant concretization of a L´evy ﬂight.

Radiation trapping of energy is important in areas as diverse as stellar atmospheres [12],

plasmas and atomic vapors luminescence [11, 13], terrestrial atmosphere and ocean op-

tics [14], molecular luminescence [15], infrared radiative transfer usually in industrial appli-

cations [16] and cold atoms [4, 17]. In these optically thick media, the emitted radiation

suﬀers several reabsorption and reemission events before eventually escaping to the exterior;

the radiation is said to be imprisoned or trapped. Atomic radiation trapping is also known as

imprisonment of resonance radiation, line transfer or radiation diﬀusion. In an astrophysi-

cal context it is further known as multiple scattering of resonance radiation. This Letter only

discusses the so-called classical incoherent trapping in which there is suﬃcient perturbation

of atomic line energy levels between individual absorption and reemission events to render

the emitting state statistically unrelated with the absorbing one: complete frequency redistri-

bution (CFR). In two-level CFR atomic models both absorption and emission spectra can be
described by suitable normalized Doppler – ΦD (x) = 1

a given distance from emission coordinates is Φ (x) e−

(Beer-Lambert law) where r is

the so-called opacity or optical density and is a dimensionless distance. Radiation trapping

can be envisaged as a random ﬂight in physical space with spectral dependent jump size

distributions. The jump size distribution must take into account the absorption probability

and this fully characterizes the spatial aspects of the random ﬂight.

We now direct our attention to the asymptotic approximations valid for large jump sizes.

A random ﬂight in which the probability density of jump lengths is given by

with µ < 2 is called a L´evy ﬂight after Mandelbrot [18] and it deﬁnes a broad distribution

for which all the moments not smaller than µ are divergent –

When the line shape is gaussian (Doppler), the integrand in Eq. (4) approaches a square

This shows that the asymptotic jump size distribution is very close to that of a L´evy

ﬂight with µ

It is thus concluded that the asymptotic jump size distribution is a L´evy ﬂight with µ =

1/2, and the ﬂight is superdiﬀusive, all the moments of the jump distribution being inﬁnite.

In Fig. 1 the jump probability is shown for Doppler, Voigt and Lorentz line shapes as

estimated from direct numerical integration of Eq. (1). The direct linear ﬁt gives for the

characteristic “tail index” (µ) of the Doppler distribution µ = 1.03 (ﬁt jump sizes 107–108)

and for the Lorentz case µ = 0.500 (ﬁt jump sizes 109–1010). This is in agreement with

the previous assertions and in particular shows that Eq. (2) is only approximate for the

Doppler line shape.

In fact, notwithstanding that the eﬀective µ parameter is (slightly)

larger than 1,

inﬁnite (10) values does not manifests itself in a continuum change of the µ value from

the Doppler to the Lorentz cases. There is an abrupt change instead at smaller jump

distances the higher the numerical value of a. This is the expected result since the asymptotic

expansion is related with the most extreme values of the wings of the spectral distribution

and these change abruptly from Doppler to Lorentz-type asymptotic values for a values as

low as 10−

At this point a brief historical note is relevant. In the 1920s Compton and Milne have

laid down the ﬁrst quantitative theory for atomic radiation trapping: a (modiﬁed) diﬀusion

equation for the (frequency) coherent spreading of excitation [19]. It was only in 1932 that

the frequency redistribution between absorption and reemission was taken into account:

Kenty [20] considered CFR and proposed a “mean or equivalent absorption coeﬃcient”

that should incorporate the actual line shape in the value of the mean diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

Kenty assumed Doppler broadening and arrived to the unexpected result that, for an inﬁnite

medium, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient would be inﬁnite [20]. This was the ﬁrst realization of

the fundamental fact that all moments of the jump size distribution are inﬁnite. Kenty’s

result shows that a diﬀusion-type equation is not valid for radiation trapping with frequency

redistribution eﬀects, a fact however only fully realized later by T. Holstein. In 1947, Hosltein

and Biberman independently proposed a Boltzmann-type integrodiﬀerential equation [21]

which remains up to present date the starting point of the vast majority of radiation trapping

models [11].

The importance of Kenty’s contribution was largely overlooked in the literature and this

Letter reassesses its historical value.

In retrospect, the 1990 Ott et al. [8] contribution

on the superdiﬀusion in microheterogeneous systems can no longer be considered the ﬁrst

experimental realization of a random ﬂight with inﬁnite moments, given that it was preceded

by many studies of radiation trapping. The authors of the current Letter also have arrived

independently to the conclusion the the photon random motion is superdiﬀusive but non-

fractal under gaussian spectral distributions [22], again not knowing of Kenty’s work which

was acknowledged only in 1999 [15].

Consider now Fig. 3 which shows single trajectories for CFR Lorentz and Doppler spectral

distributions in a 3D inﬁnite medium (compare Mandelbrot’s well known ﬁgure [18]). It

displays the two features characteristic of L´evy ﬂights: (i) the fact that the longer pathlength

6

jumps, although much less common, are of paramount importance to the overall spreading of

excitation and (ii) self-similar behavior. There is an hierarchy of clusters formed at diﬀerent

lengthscales but with similar topology. The set of visited points constitutes in fact a fractal

of characteristic dimension µ for the Lorentz distribution [2, 3, 7]. For the Doppler case, the

asymptotic form is only approximately given by Eq. (2) with µ = 1.03, hence its classiﬁcation

as a generalized L´evy ﬂight.

Results strictly apply to an inﬁnite 3D medium but in a vast number of experimental

situations the system is ﬁnite and the trajectory is truncated before the asymptotic Levy

expansion is able to manifest itself.

In connection with this, Mantegna and Stanley [23]

introduced a class of L´evy ﬂights, the truncated L´evy ﬂight (TLF), in which the largest

steps of an ordinary L´evy ﬂight are eliminated. They consider a truncated L´evy distribution

with a sharp cutoﬀ in its power tail. The truncated distribution is not self-similar when

convoluted, and obviously has ﬁnite variance. Thus, the truncated L´evy ﬂight converges to

a Gaussian process due to the central limit theorem in contrast to the ordinary stable L´evy

process [24, 25]. Again, these recent contributions cast some light on the historical 1932

Kenty contribution: driven by the discomfort of an inﬁnite diﬀusion coeﬃcient, this author

has already proposed a diﬀusion coeﬃcient for radiation migration conﬁned to a ﬁnite vol-

ume [20]. Although truncation procedures render the moments of the distribution ﬁnite, the

convergence to a Gaussian can be extremely slow and the random walk can exhibit anoma-

lous behavior and multi-scaling properties in a wide range before convergence [23, 24, 25].

In this Letter, it was shown that photon trajectories arising from classical incoherent two-

level Doppler, Voigt and Lorentz complete frequency redistribution trapping are superdiﬀu-

sive. Lorentz line shape correspond to an exact L´evy ﬂight while the Doppler case is only

approximately given by r−

(1+µ) (generalized L´evy ﬂight). The Voigt continuous transforma-

tion from Doppler into Lorentz is accompanied by a sharp transition from a Doppler µ

1

≃

into a Lorentz-like µ = 1/2 tail index coeﬃcient which constitutes the asymptotic expansion

for the most extreme jump sizes.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we report results of an ab initio calculation of E1 amplitudes, lifetimes, and
polarizabilities for several low-lying levels of ytterbium. In Ref. [1] we calculated the energies
and hyperﬁne structure (hfs) constants of low-lying levels of ytterbium. In that calculations
the accuracy of atomic wave functions was tested at the short distances by comparison of
the calculated hfs constants with the experimental ones. The latter are usually known to
a very good accuracy, providing a good test of the quality of the wave function near the
nucleus.

E1 amplitudes, in contrast, are determined by the wave function behavior at large dis-
tances. Usual experimental accuracy for the oscillator strengths and scalar polarizabilities
is on the level of few percent. This is close or even less than the accuracy of precise atomic
calculations (see, e. g., calculations for Ba [2] and Cs [3]). Tensor polarizabilities can be
measured with the accuracy of 1% or better [4,5]. Thus, it is possible to test an atomic wave
function at large distances at 1% level. Note that 1% accuracy is crucial for calculations of
parity nonconservation eﬀects in atoms, because it allows to test predictions of the Standard
model at small momentum transfer [3,6]. So far such precision has been achieved only for
one-electron atoms Cs and Fr [7–9]. In this work we deal with a much more complicated Yb
atom.

We consider ytterbium as a two electron atom with the core [1s2, ..., 4f 14]. Valence-
valence correlations are taken into account by the conﬁguration interaction (CI) method,
while core-valence and core-core correlations are treated within the second order of the many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT). The latter is used to construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian
for the CI problem in the valence space. The details of the method can be found in the
papers [10,11]. Application of this method to calculations of hfs constants has been discussed
in [1,2,12]. In Ref. [2] the method has been extended to the calculations of polarizabilities.
Here we apply this technique for calculations of lifetimes, E1 amplitudes, and polarizabilities
of ytterbium.

II. GENERAL FORMALISM

Let us write out several formulae that will be used in the following. The expression for
oscillator strength for a, J → a′, J ′ transition has the form [13] (atomic units m = ¯h = e = 1
are used throughout the paper):

where ωaJ,a′J ′ = EaJ − Ea′J ′, D is the dipole moment operator, and reduced matrix elements
(MEs) are deﬁned as follows:

f (aJ, a′J ′

) = −

|ha, J||D||a′, J ′

The lifetime τ of a level is the inverse of the total transition rate. The probability for
a, J → a′, J ′ transition is given by:

where c is the speed of light.

Static polarizability of the sublevel |a, J, Mi in a DC electric ﬁeld E = Eˆz is deﬁned as:

∆Ea,J,M = −

αa,J,M E 2

E 2,

where ∆Ea,J,M is the energy shift and α0 and α2 deﬁne the scalar and tensor polarizabilities,
correspondingly. Being a second order property, αa,J,M can be expressed as a sum over
unperturbed intermediate states:

αa,J,M = −2

n

|ha, J, M|Dz|n, Jn, Mi|2

where En is an unperturbed energy of a level n, and the sum runs over all states of opposite
parity. The formalism of the reduced MEs allows to write explicit expressions for the scalar
and tensor parts of the polarizability:

α0,a,J =

In order to use Eqs. (5)–(7) in calculations one needs to know a complete set of eigenstates
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. It becomes practically impossible when dimension of a CI
space exceeds few thousand determinants. It is known, that it is much more convenient to
solve inhomogeneous equation instead of the direct summation over the intermediate states
[14,15]. Indeed, let us consider the solution of the following equation:

where q = 0, ±1 and M ′ = M + q. Obviously, the right hand side in Eq. (5) can be expressed
in terms of the function Xa,M (note that D0 ≡ Dz):

(Ea − H)|Xa,M ′i = Dq|a, J, Mi,

αa,J,M = −2ha, J, M|D0|Xa,M i.

If we want to rewrite Eqs. (6) and (7) in terms of the function Xa,M ′, we need to de-
compose the latter in terms that correspond to particular angular momenta Ji. Generally
speaking, there can be three such terms with Ji = J, J ± 1:

Xa,M ′ = Xa,J−1,M ′ + Xa,J,M ′ + Xa,J+1,M ′.

where sums run over J ′ = J, J ±1. Note, that these equations are valid only if all 3j-symbols
on the right hand side do not turn to zero. One has to take it into account when choosing
for what spherical component q to solve Eq. (8).

If we know the solution of Eq. (8) and its decomposition (10), then expressions (11) and
(12) allow us to ﬁnd both scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the state |a, Ji. Moreover, the
same functions Xa,J ′,M ′ can be also used to ﬁnd other second order atomic properties, such
as amplitudes of the Stark-induced E1 transitions or parity nonconserving E1 transitions
between the states of the same nominal parity (see, for example, Ref. [16]).

III. CALCULATION DETAILS AND RESULTS

A. Orbital basis set and CI space.

The calculation procedure is quite similar to that of Ref. [2]. For this reason we give here
only a brief description of its features. This calculation is done in the V N approximation,
that means that core orbitals are obtained from the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) equations for
a neutral atom (we use the DHF computer code [17]). The basis set for the valence electrons
includes 6s, 6p, 5d, 7s, 7p, 6d DHF orbitals and 8s–15s, 8p–15p, 7d–14d, 5f–10f, and 5g–7g
virtual orbitals. The latter were formed in two steps. On the ﬁrst step we construct orbitals
with the help of a recurrent procedure, which is similar to that suggested in Ref. [18] and
described in Refs. [11,16]. After that we diagonalize the V N DHF operator to obtain the
ﬁnal set of orbitals.

For this orbital basis set the complete CI is made for both even-parity and odd-parity
levels. Two-electron wave functions are the linear combinations of the Slater determinants
with a given Jz. It means that no symmetrization with respect to angular momentum J is
made.

Within the CI+MBPT method the wave function of the valence electrons is found from

the eigenvalue equation:

B. Eﬀective operators.

4

Heﬀ|a, J, Mi = Ea|a, J, Mi.

Eq. (8) is rewritten as equation for valence electrons only:

(Ea − Heﬀ)|Xa,M ′i = Deﬀ,q|a, J, Mi,

(13)

(14)

with the eﬀective operators, which are found by means of the MBPT. The eﬀective Hamilto-
nian for two valence electrons is formed within the second order MBPT [10]. We used RPA
for the eﬀective dipole moment operator (see, for example, Ref. [19]). We have checked that
MBPT corrections to Deﬀ, which are not included in RPA, are small if RPA equations are
solved with 6s electrons excluded from the self-consistency procedure. That means that RPA
equations have the same form as in the V N −2 approximation. The more detailed description
of the eﬀective operator formalism is given in [12].

C. Transition amplitudes and lifetimes.

We ﬁrst solve eigenvalue Eq. (13) with the eﬀective Hamiltonian for low-lying even- and
odd-parity states. Strictly speaking, the eﬀective Hamiltonian can be safely used only for the
energy levels below the core excitation threshold. For Yb this threshold lies at 23189 cm−1
above the ground state [20]. However, it was shown in [1] that theoretical spectrum is
quite good up to ∼40000 cm−1. Correspondingly, we can work (with some caution) with
the states lying slightly above the core excitation threshold.
In our approach we fail to
reproduce the states with unﬁlled f shell and correspondingly to account properly for the
interaction with such states. For this reason we restrict ourselves to the consideration of
the states lying suﬃciently far from those with unﬁlled f shell. We consider E1 transitions
between four low-lying odd-parity states (3P o
1 (6s6p)) and seven even-
parity states (1S0 (6s2), 3D1,2,3 (5d6s), 1D2 (5d6s), 3S1 (6s7s), and 1S0 (6s7s)). The state
1 (6s6p) requires special attention. The nearest f 13 5d 6s2 state lies only 3800 cm−1 above
1P o
the latter and their interaction is not negligible. We estimated that conﬁguration f 13 5d 6s2
contributes on the level of several percent to the wave function of 1P o
1 (6s6p) state. We do
not take into account this conﬁguration mixture. This reduces the accuracy of the calculated
1P o

1 (6s6p) → 1LJ E1 amplitudes.
When eigenfunctions for the valence electrons are found, we can calculate transition am-
plitudes and lifetimes. The results of calculations are presented in Table I. The magnitudes
of the E1 amplitudes vary in a wide range. These variations correspond in part to the
approximate selection rules ∆S = 0 and ∆J = ∆L, which are easily traced through Table I.
For large amplitudes we estimate the accuracy of our calculation to be 3-5%. For the reason
discussed above the amplitudes h1LJ |D|1P o
1 (6s6p)i do not follow this rule. The accuracy
for these amplitudes, as well as for small amplitudes (≤ 0.5 a.u.), is about 15-20%.

0,1,2 (6s6p) and 1P o

Where available, we compare our results with those of other theoretical [21,22] and ex-
perimental [23–28] groups. For the convenience of comparison we recalculated the oscillator
strengths and transition probabilities to the reduced MEs. Calculations in Ref. [21] were
performed in the L-S coupling scheme. The simplest semiempirical method [29] was used
then to evaluate the radial parts. In Ref. [22] the multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock method
was used. The valence-core electronic correlations were included semiempirically. Compar-
ing our results with the results of other theoretical works, one can see that it was important
to account for the valence-core correlations.

Now, using Eq. (3) we can ﬁnd the transition probabilities and the lifetimes of the levels
(see Table II). In these calculations we used experimental transition frequencies. Therefore,
the accuracy of these numbers depends only on the accuracy of the dominant transition
amplitudes. As a result, the largest error (40%) takes place for the states 1S0(6s7s) and
1D2(5d6s) where the transition to the state 1P o
1 (6s6p) is dominant. For other states we
estimate theoretical accuracy for the lifetimes as 10% or better.

D. Polarizabilities.

In order to ﬁnd the polarizabilities we substitute eigenfunctions in the right hand side
of Eq. (14) and solve corresponding inhomogeneous equation. After that Eqs. (11) and (12)
give us α0 and α2. Results of these calculations are presented in Table III. It is seen that,
unlike barium (see Ref. [2]), α2 has typically the same order of magnitude as α0. For this
reason the theoretical accuracy for α2, as a rule, is similar to that for α0.
In contrast,
experimental data for α2 are usually much more precise and complete.

There are several sources of errors in the calculations of polarizabilities. Some of them
are the same as for hfs calculations, and are connected with the inaccuracy in the wave
functions and the eﬀective operators (note, that RPA corrections to the dipole operator are
much smaller than for hfs operators). The additional source of errors is the inaccuracy in
eigenvalues. Finally, solving Eq. (14) we do not account for conﬁgurations 4f 13 nl n′l′ n′′l′′.
In other words, we do not take into account f shell polarization. Fortunately, the states
of conﬁguration 4f 13 nl n′l′ n′′l′′, that can be reached by one-electron transitions from the
levels studied here, lie rather far above the latter. The estimates show, that contribution of
f shell polarization to the polarizabilities of the states listed in Table III does not exceed
2-3 a.u.

The ﬁnal accuracy of calculations is very diﬀerent for diﬀerent levels. For instance, the
95% of the polarizability of the ground state 1S0 (6s2) is due to the ME h1S0|D|1P o
1 (6s6p)i.
Supposing that this ME is calculated within the accuracy of 20%, the latter for α0 (1S0)
will be about 40% (corresponding transition frequency is reproduced almost ideally [1]). We
need to say that even taking into account the large uncertainty of our result, it signiﬁcantly
diﬀers from α0 (1S0) = 266 a.u. obtained in Ref. [30] where the Hartree-Fock method was
used.

For the DJ (5d6s) states the situation is more complicated. There are large cancellations
between contributions of P o
J (6s6p) states and higher-lying states. For this reason their
polarizabilities are small and the role of diﬀerent small contributions is enhanced. Thus,
analysis of the accuracy becomes diﬃcult; only for the tensor polarizability of 3D3 (5d6s)
state we can estimate the accuracy to be 20%. All other values of α0 and α2 for DJ (5d6s)
states presented in Table III are rather estimates by the order of magnitude.

The scalar polarizabilities of the levels 3S1 (6s7s) and 1S0 (6s7s) are basically determined
J (6s7p)i. Because of the closeness of f 13 5d2 6s states we failed
J (6s7p) states. Correspondingly, the values for

by the MEs hSJ ′ (6s7s)|D|P o
to obtain the reliable wave functions for P o
α0(3S1 (6s7s)) and α0(1S0 (6s7s)) are also only the estimates.

Now let us go over to the odd-parity states. The accuracy of α0 and α2 for 3P o

J (6s6p)-
triplet is 6-10%. The main contribution here comes from the 3DJ (5d6s) multiplet and there
are no cancellations because all important levels of opposite parity lie above and contribute

6

with the same sign. The accuracy for α0 of 1P o
1 (6s6p) state is about 40% and for α2 even
worse (50%). This is due to the large contribution of the intermediate state 1S0 (6s7s) to
these polarizabilities (see above).

In Ref. [31] the Stark shift of the 1S0 (6s2) → 3P o

measured. The Stark shift rate was found to be K= −61.924 (0.193) a.u.
polarizabilities this magnitude can be written as:

Using the numbers from Table III, we ﬁnd that K= −55 (9) a.u., in good agreement with
the experimental result [31].

In Ref. [23], the Stark shifts for 1S0 (6s2) → 3D1,2 (5d6s) transitions were observed. These

shifts depend on the diﬀerences in scalar polarizabilities (α0 (1S0) − α0 (3D1,2)):

where theoretical values are taken from Table III.

The method used here allows us to calculate not only static polarizabilities, but, also
the Stark-induced amplitudes for diﬀerent transitions. For instance, the magnitude of the
vector transition polarizability |β| for 1S0 (6s2) → 3D1 (5d6s) transition was calculated to
be 122 (12) a.u., in good agreement with our previous calculation 138 (30) a.u. [32] and
experimental result 113 (15) a.u. [23].

E. Conclusion.

Application of the eﬀective operator technique to the Yb atom is hampered by the ex-
istence of the shallow 4f shell. Nevertheless, it is possible to make reliable calculations of
diﬀerent atomic properties including transition frequencies, hyperﬁne constants, E1 ampli-
tudes, lifetimes and polarizabilities for many low-lying energy levels. It is of a particular
importance, that with some caution calculations can be done even for levels above the core
excitation threshold, which for Yb lies at 23189 cm−1.

Abstract

This paper is a theoretical work in support of a newly proposed experiment (R. Stutz and E.

Cornell, Bull. Am. Soc. Phys. 89, 76 2004) that promises greater sensitivity to measurements

of the electron’s electric dipole moment (EDM) based on the trapping of molecular ions. Such

an experiment requires the choice of a suitable molecule that is both experimentally feasible and

possesses an expectation of a reasonable EDM signal. We ﬁnd that the molecular ions PtH+,

HfH+, and HfF+ are suitable candidates in their low-lying 3∆ states. In particular, we anticipate

that the eﬀective electric ﬁelds generated inside these molecules are approximately of 73 GV/cm,

-17 GV/cm, and -18 GV/cm respectively. As a byproduct of this discussion, we also explain how

to make estimates of the size of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld acting in a molecule, using commercially

available nonrelativistic molecular structure software.

INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model of elementary particle physics admits that the electron may have

an electric dipole moment (EDM), but a darn small one; the Standard Model prediction is
on the order of de = 10−38 e-cm, many orders of magnitude below the current experimental

limit. Nevertheless, in models beyond the Standard Model, notably super-symmetry, a larger

EDM is expected, sometimes tantalizingly close to the current experimental upper bounds

on de [2]. To observe de would imply a diﬀerent form of charge-conjugation/parity (CP)

violation than the familiar form in the K- and B-meson systems. The observation of de

requires extremely large electric ﬁelds to observe the energy shift due to diﬀerent alignments

of de along the quantization axis.

The current upper limit on the electron EDM,1.6

10−27 e-cm, comes from measurements

×

in atomic thallium [1]. In this experiment, an eﬀective electric ﬁeld is generated inside the

atom. The magnitude of this electric ﬁeld (on the order of 70 MV/cm) is far larger than

the ﬁeld that could be applied directly in the laboratory. This circumstance is what makes

an atomic EDM experiment desirable.

Taking this idea even further, Sandars noted that the eﬀective electric ﬁeld within a

molecule can be even larger than that within an atom [3]. This insight has prompted a

series of proposed and actual experiments, aimed at using molecules as high-electric-ﬁeld

laboratories. These experiments have employed either molecular beams or traps for neutral

molecules, including molecules PbO [4, 5] and YbF [8, 9]. Several others have also been

proposed as viable candidates [6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13].

Recently, a new experiment has been proposed that may increase the experimental sen-

sitivity to an electron EDM by orders of magnitude [14, 15]. The key to this experiment is

using molecular ions in lieu of neutral molecules. Because ions are far easier to trap for long

times than neutrals, the proposed experiment wins in terms of long coherence times. Never-

theless, such an experiment poses a number of challenges, both in experimental technology

and in the choice of a reasonable molecule.

The purpose of this paper is to identify diatomic molecular ions that possess properties

that are desirable for this experiment. For instance, the molecule should have a relatively

small degeneracy of quantum mechanical states near its ground state. This feature, in a

cold sample at thermal equilibrium, would ensure that most or all of the ions are already in

2

or near a state that is useful for the EDM measurement. Because the number of ions in a

trap is fairly small, this requirement is necessary for achieving a good signal-to-noise ratio.

To meet this requirement we restrict our attention to diatomic hydrides, where the light

hydrogen atom will contribute to a relatively large rotational constant. Similarly, we are

interested in heavy atoms with spinless isotopes in order to ensure a favorable population

distribution. This requirement is an experimental one. On the theory side, isotopes with

spin are useful in characterizing the accuracy of the calculations and for making empirical

estimates [4, 13]. A second requirement is that the electric ﬁeld used to polarize the molecule

must be relatively small, on the order of 100 V/cm or less. This is because in the proposed

experiment, the polarizing ﬁeld must be rotating at MHz frequencies in order to act on

the molecules without accelerating them out of the trap. Lastly, we restrict ourselves to

molecules that have at least one unpaired spin (paramagnetic, i.e. molecules with S

= 0),

so that the net EDM of the electrons does not vanish

Because we conﬁne our attention to diatomic molecules, we must meet two additional

requirements: (1) A large dipole moment, on the order of 1 Debye, which is not hard to

achieve if the two atoms are quite diﬀerent, and (2) A small energy splitting between even-

and odd-parity branches of the ground state.

In other words, a small omega doublet is

desirable.

In general, the size of the omega doublet is smaller for larger quantum number Ω, which

represents the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum of the electron about the inter-

molecular axis. For this reason we prefer diatomic molecules with high angular momentum.

In the following we consider species with 3∆ molecular symmetry, which can support values

of Ω as large as Ω = 3. This choice is in sharp contrast with previous EDM candidate

molecules, most of which were based on 2Σ molecular symmetries. More recently, molecular

ions of 3Σ [4, 5] or 2Π [12, 13] symmetry have been considered as well.

Finally, the essential requirement for the molecule is that it must possess a large internal

eﬀective electric ﬁeld. It is this ﬁeld that acts on the electron’s EDM to make a measur-

able signal. A quick review of the relevant physics reveals why a large internal ﬁeld is so

important. If an electric ﬁeld were applied to an atom, and if relativity did not matter,

then a given electron would feel no net electric ﬁeld. In equilibrium, the applied external

ﬁeld would be exactly balanced by the ﬁeld due to all the other charges in the atom, or

else the electron would be pulled to a diﬀerent equilibrium. This is the content of Schiﬀ’s

3

6
theorem [16]. However, the fact that the electron can move at relativistic speeds in an atom

provides a loophole around this theorem. In the relativistic case, the electron’s equilibrium

is governed by the balance of electric ﬁelds, plus the motional magnetic ﬁeld generated when

it swings by the nucleus. Thus the net electric ﬁeld, by itself, can be non vanishing. By

applying an external electric ﬁeld, the non zero ﬁeld within the molecule can be increased

by a relativistic enhancement factor manifested through the mixing of s and p atomic states.

The resulting energy shift scales with the third power of the nuclear charge, and therefore

strongly favors heavy atoms as EDM candidates.

Qualitatively, molecules can be even more eﬀective at mixing s and p states of atoms than

externally applied ﬁelds. Indeed, in molecular orbitals it is possible for s and p levels to

perfectly hybridize, as in the conjugated bonds of carbon-bearing molecules. The relativistic

enhancement factor can be estimated from its value for the heavy atom, therefore estimating

the eﬀective internal electric ﬁeld becomes a question for nonrelativistic molecular structure

theory. The mixing of s and p atomic orbitals is useful only when it produces a molecular

orbital of σ symmetry. An electron in such a molecular orbital has no orbital angular

momentum about the molecular axis, and can thus penetrate close to the heavy atom’s

nucleus, where relativistic eﬀects are greatest. This behavior explains why molecules with

total symmetry Σ have been preferred in the past.

As noted above, however, the experiment under consideration is likely constrained to

molecules with nonzero angular momentum about the axis. To accomplish these seemingly

contradictory goals, we seek molecules having two valence electrons. One, of σ molecular

symmetry, will be responsible for the eﬀective electric ﬁeld and consequent EDM signal. The

second, of δ symmetry, will allow for small omega doubling. We are thus led to contemplate

molecules of (σδ)3∆Ω symmetry overall. Further, since δ molecular orbitals are likely to

arise from d-type atomic orbitals, we seek diatomic molecules in which the heavy atom is a

transition metal. Previous theoretical work on heavy transition metal hydrides [17] identiﬁes

a pair of likely molecules with low-lying 3∆ states, namely, HfH+ and PtH+.

In the following sections we will explore the properties of these and other molecules in

terms of their usefulness to an electron EDM experiment. In Sec. II we revisit the theoretical

methods for estimating the EDM signal in terms of nonrelativistic molecular wave functions

and the way in which such wave functions can be constructed. In Sec. III we present concrete

examples of calculations for various diatomic molecules. These calculations verify that the

4

perturbative methods we employ can semi quantitatively reproduce the eﬀective electric

ﬁelds predicted previously by more substantial calculations.

II. BACKGROUND: OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELECTRON

EDM

A. The eﬀective electric dipole moment of an atom

In EDM circles, it is customary to speak of an “eﬀective electric ﬁeld” experienced by the

electron inside an atom or molecule. What this means in practice is that the energy shift

due to an electron EDM of magnitude de is simply

We use the letter F to denote electric ﬁeld strengths, to distinguish them from energies,

denoted E. To evaluate the energy shift, one writes the perturbation Hamiltonian in Dirac

notation ([20], p. 254 ﬀ.) is:

and “lower” components of the electron’s Dirac wave function. Each of ψU and ψL, in turn,

stands for a two-component spinor.

In Eq.(2), σ is a Pauli matrix designating the electron’s spin, so the combination deσ

describes the EDM of the electron. (The direction of the electron’s EDM is presumed to

be collinear with its magnetic moment). This moment interacts with the instantaneous

electric ﬁeld F experienced by the electron. To a good approximation, this ﬁeld is given

by the Coulomb ﬁeld of the heavy nucleus with charge Ze, F = Zeˆr/r2. Here r is the

electron-heavy atom distance. Here and throughout this paper we use atomic units, setting
~ = me = 1.

Next we denote the lower component of the electron’s ground state wave function to be

electric ﬁeld would create a linear combination of s and p states,

Higher angular momentum states are also possible in principle but do not make a substantial

where α is the ﬁne structure constant and γ =

and νp are the eﬀective quantum numbers for the s and p states of the heavy atom, deﬁned

as the the principal quantum number shifted by a quantum defect. All values of νs and

νp are obtained from Ref. [43]. The constant Zi is the eﬀective nuclear charge seen by the

valence electron; for a neutral atom Zi = 1. An additional energy shift would arise from

perturbations due to the p3/2 excited state. However, the matrix element connecting the

s1/2 state to the p3/2 state is vanishingly small, since the p3/2 radial function has negligible

amplitude near the nucleus [21].

The energy shift of an atom in an electric ﬁeld, due to the EDM of the electron thus

requires mixing the s1/2 ground state and the p1/2 excited state. The resulting energy shift

is, in atomic units,

This expression can be viewed in two ways. One way is to envision that the atom gains

an EDM that is bigger than the electron’s EDM by the factor in square brackets in Eq.(8).

Alternatively, the existing electronic EDM may be seen as experiencing the applied ﬁeld

Fapplied, enhanced by this same factor.

B. The eﬀective electric ﬁeld inside a molecule

In diatomic molecules, the same kind of s-p mixing may occur, perhaps much more

substantially than in an atom [22, 23]. If so, the basic expression for the measured energy

shift is still given by Eq.(6), but the coeﬃcients may have quite diﬀerent values. To estimate

these coeﬃcients, we expand the molecular orbital wave function of the contributing electron

in terms of atomic orbitals:

(9)

Here s and p still refer to the relevant atomic orbitals on the heavy atom, from which the

EDM shift will arise. But now there are other orbitals that may participate. For example,

the electron wave function may have considerable contributions from d or f orbitals on the

heavy atom or from atomic orbitals residing on the other atom. Thus, in general, it may not

be a good approximation that ǫ2

p = 1. Nevertheless, one may seek molecules for which

ǫp| ≈

s + ǫ2

Once the amplitudes ǫs and ǫp are known, we can use Eq.(6) to ﬁnd the energy shift, with

the following caveat. The orbital

here stands for the nonrelativistic p wave function of

the atom. It is therefore a linear combination of the relativistic atomic states, denoted by

total spin j:

In strong contrast to Eq.(8), the molecular expression Eq.(12) does not depend explicitly

on the applied electric ﬁeld Fapplied. The eﬀective electric ﬁeld is simply the coeﬃcient in

front of de. Applying an external ﬁeld in the laboratory is essential, however. In zero electric

ﬁeld, the molecule’s energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of parity [30]:

but separated by an energy Edoub referred to as the Ω-doubling energy. By convention, the

lower (upper) sign of this doublet is denoted by the letter e (f ). In such a state, the electronic

spin projection σ will lie along the molecular dipole moment as often as against it, canceling

the energy shift. However, in a modest electric ﬁeld Fapplied, the signed values of

Ω are

again good quantum numbers, and the expression Eq.(12) is relevant. To overcome Edoub,

the ﬁeld must be large compared to a “critical” ﬁeld, at which the Stark energy overcomes

the energy diﬀerence between the two parity eigenstates:

where dM is the permanent electric dipole moment of the molecule. For the proposed

molecular ion experiment, it is desirable to make Fcrit as small as possible, preferably below

100 V/cm [14].

III. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

There remains the question of evaluating the constants ǫs and ǫp for a given molecule of

interest. Fortunately, it is common practice in molecular structure theory to cast molecular

orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The atomic orbitals, in turn, are

usefully expressed in terms of a Gaussian basis set that is carefully constructed to reproduce

the energy levels of the individual atoms. After decades of development, these methods

are now robust and commercially available in software packages such as Gaussian [24] and

MOLPRO [25]. We use MOLPRO in the calculations performed here.

8

A. Molecular electronic structure

We assume that the molecules are well-approximated by Hund’s angular momentum cou-

pling case (a). This approximation is justiﬁed by the much greater strength of the spin-orbit
interaction and the exchange splitting (both on the order of 103cm−1) as compared to rota-
tional energies (on the order of 10 cm−1). In this case the relevant quantum numbers of each

electron are its projection of orbital (λ) and spin (σ) angular momentum on the molecular

axis. (In fact, strong spin-orbit mixing will impact these quantum numbers slightly, pushing

the molecules toward Hund’s case (c). We will deal with this later).

To make a concrete calculation, each molecular orbital is expanded in a basis set of

Gaussian functions, where a basis element is deﬁned as

Here each

is a Gaussian function centered on either of the atoms in the molecule. Such

gii

|

a set of Gaussians is chosen to optimize the energies of each atom separately and is provided

in one of a set of standard basis sets, referred to below. With this basis, it is now possible

to deﬁne an orbital as

The Hartree-Fock (HF) procedure minimizes the energy of the ground state conﬁguration,

hence only one conﬁguration is optimized. This is done by minimizing the coeﬃcients in the

orbitals and conﬁgurations. For concreteness, the conﬁguration is

and the procedure ﬁnds the dk and ckj that minimize the total electronic energy E. After

this procedure, we perform a Multi-Conﬁguration Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) [26, 27]

calculation with a Complete Active Space (CAS) within MOLPRO. The MCSCF takes the

HF E as an initial guess and ﬁnds appropriate linear combinations of the conﬁgurations

many diﬀerent symmetries and spin states. This wave function is

and the procedure varies fl, dlk, and ckj in order to minimize the average E. This is the

time-consuming part of the calculation due to the non linear optimization routine. This

step is then followed by the Multi-Reference Conﬁguration Interaction (MRCI) [28, 29]

program. A MRCI calculation uses the MCSCF conﬁgurations and mixes in single and

double excitations. The wave function is

where this procedure ﬁnds the hm that minimize the value of E for a given symmetry, subject

to the constraint that the fl, dlk and ckj are all ﬁxed.

Therefore, deep inside the MCSCF wave function is the σ molecular orbital that mixes the

atomic s and p orbitals. We denote this orbital as

mol, σ

, which has an explicit expansion

into the Gaussian basis functions according to Eq.(18). Analogously, the wave function for

the heavy atom (e.g., Hf+ or Pt+) is also computed at the MCSCF and MRCI levels and

contains atomic orbitals

There are two ﬁnal, but sometimes decisive, corrections. First, the desired conﬁguration

does not constitute the entire wave function, but only a fraction of it, given by its amplitude,

e.g. h0 in the MRCI expansion in Eq.(20). For the molecules considered in the proposed

experiment, however, we have found this factor to be within several percent of unity. Alter-

natively, it does play a crucial role in the case of PbO where the factor h0 is considerably
less than unity for the (σσ∗)3Σ metastable state; the state that contributes to the EDM

signal.

More signiﬁcantly, the molecular state identiﬁed in Eq.(20) may be mixed with others

via spin-orbit couplings. In the case that one other molecular symmetry is mixed in, we get

in terms of a mixing angle χ. There is no prime on the Ω since spin-orbit interactions preserve

the value of Ω. The factor cos χ can be quite signiﬁcant. For example, in a 2Π state (as in

PbF [10] and the Halides HBr+ [12] and HI+ [12, 13]), the single valence electron would be in

a π state and would not contribute at all to an eﬀective electric ﬁeld (cos χ = 0). However,

spin-orbit mixing with nearby 2Σ states can introduce a σ electron, but its eﬀective electric

ﬁeld is reduced by a factor of sin χ. This mixing is responsible for the large eﬀective ﬁeld

in PbF because it has a very large spin-orbit constant. Finally, we arrive at the expression

used to estimate the eﬀective electric ﬁeld in our approximation:

B. Potential curves

In the available literature, there is no consensus as to the true ground state of PtH+

[17, 18, 19]; only one paper attempts to work out the ground state of HfH+ [17]. The

debate arises in PtH+ concerning the ordering of the 1Σ and 3∆ states. Therefore, we use

MOLPRO along with state-of-the-art basis sets [38] to compute several electronic states of

these molecules in addition to the 3∆ states of interest.

Diatomic molecules belong to the C2∞ point group; however, MOLPRO only uses Abelian

point groups, necessitating the use of the C2v point group for our calculations. In this point

group, the projection of electronic angular momentum along the diatomic axis (Λ) will

transform as the following: Λ = 2n will transform as A1 symmetry, Λ =

2n as A2,

−

Λ = 2n + 1 as B1 and Λ =

(2n + 1) as B2. As a result, the full ∆ symmetry transforms as

−

A1

A2, requiring the MOLPRO calculations to include both the A1 and A2 symmetries.

⊕
The MRCI [28, 29] calculations are performed after a MCSCF [26, 27] calculation at
various internuclear separations (1˚A < r < 7˚A). The term “active space” describes the set

of orbitals being used to construct the conﬁgurations, as in Eq.(18). The active space is

increased in one of two ways. One is to allow the electrons to reside in higher-lying orbitals

that are nominally unoccupied. The second is to promote electrons from previously closed

shells into these same orbitals. Both of these options allow more parameters with which to

optimize the total energy, but it comes at the expense of an increased computational burden.

11

The basis sets and active space sizes are bench-marked against the dissociation energies

of [17, 18, 19]. Our ﬁnal choice was the ECP60MWB basis set of the Stuttgart/Cologne

group [32] for the heavy atom along with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis [39] for the hydrogen.

The MWB bases of the Stuttgart/Cologne [32, 38] group stand for neutral atom quasi-

relativistic potentials. To make calculations manageable, these basis sets deal explicitly

only with electrons outside of a 60-electron “core.” The eﬀect of these core electrons is

incorporated through an eﬀective core potential (ECP), which is also provided along with

the basis sets. The ECP’s include angular-averaged (i.e., scalar) relativistic eﬀects.

The active space chosen is of the form (A1,B1,B2,A2)=(6,2,2,1) for both PtH+ and HfH+.

This notation means that the ﬁrst 6 A1, 2 B1, 2 B2 and 1 A2 orbitals above the closed space

are active. In PtH+ and HfH+, we close oﬀ orbitals in (2,1,1,0). Closed orbitals participate

in optimizing the energy subject to the constraint that they are always doubly occupied.

Thus, they do not participate in correlations. These calculations resulted in dissociation

energies of 3.14eV(PtH+) and 2.49eV(HfH+) compared to previous theoretical energies of

2.87eV and 2.50eV [17]. Dyall [18] obtains a dissociation energy for PtH+ of 2.00eV while

Zurita et al. [19] obtain 2.22eV, both of which are signiﬁcantly smaller than our result. Our

deeper, and presumably more accurate, dissociation energies are most likely due to increased

computational eﬃciency over the past decade. Calculations on PtH+ were completed in

approximately 6 cpu-hours per point on a 2.4 GHz processor, while for HfH+ they were

completed in approximately 20 cpu-minutes per point.

In order to further test the basis sets, we performed calculations on Pt and Hf to ﬁnd

the ionization energies. We ran a MCSCF/MRCI calculation on Pt, Pt+ and Pt++ as well

as for Hf, Hf+ and Hf++. We found the ﬁrst and second ionization energies of Pt to be
65000cm−1 and 143000cm−1 and of Hf to be 49600cm−1 and 115500cm−1. They agree with
the empirical values [43, 44] to within 6000 cm−1.

Born-Oppenheimer potential curves for several symmetries are presented in Fig.(1). The

curves are generated by ﬁtting an extended Rydberg function to the points obtained from

the MOLPRO calculation, using the method of Ref. [31]. All curves shown dissociate to

the ground 2S state of H and the 2D state of the transition metal ion. To assign a Hund’s

very close to unity. As in the case of a PtH+, we ﬁnd there are several conﬁgurations, each

having two unpaired electrons in the A1 symmetry group. Upon examining the orbitals

where these electrons lie, we ﬁnd one has angular momentum projection λ = 0, while the

other has λ = +2. Hence, this is a (σδ) conﬁguration. Some CI vectors have the same

unpaired electrons but have paired electrons in a diﬀerent orbital and/or symmetry group.

In our approximation, these paired electrons play no role, and therefore they contribute

nothing to the eﬀective electric ﬁeld within the molecule. Lastly, if this conﬁguration is

truly a 3∆, there should be an equivalent energy conﬁguration with one orbital in symmetry

A1 and another in symmetry A2. This is indeed what we ﬁnd.

Recall that Hund’s case (a) describes a diatomic molecule with spin and orbital motion

strongly coupled to the molecular axis. Hence the electronic part of the Hamiltonian is

dominant followed by spin-orbit and then rotational coupling. Within the case (a) MRCI

for HfH+. At this level we therefore agree qualitatively with the ordering of states given

by Ref. [17] for PtH+, but not HfH+. The equilibrium separations compare favorably to

previous results for PtH+ [17, 18, 19] and HfH+ [17]. Rotational constants were not quoted
in these papers. In the 3∆ states of PtH+ and HfH+ we ﬁnd r = 1.51˚A, Be = 7.37cm−1 and
r = 1.82˚Aand B = 5.11cm−1.

C. Estimating diagonal spin-orbit contributions

Roughly speaking, the molecules inherit a large spin-orbit interaction from the heavy ion.

Moreover, the spin-orbit constant A in PtH+ is expected to be negative, as it is in the Pt+

ion, thus shifting the 3∆3 state lower in energy. For this reason it was previously anticipated
that 3∆3 is likely to be the absolute ground state of PtH+ [18]. By contrast, in HfH+, A
is expected to be positive and hence the 3∆1 state is shifted down in energy. To estimate

the size of the shift, we require knowledge of A in both molecules. Using methods outlined

in Ref. [30], we estimate the value of A using van Vleck’s “pure precession hypothesis”

[42]. Under this approximation, the spin-orbit coupling arises from the heavy atom, and the

atomic orbital angular momentum l of each electron is taken to be a good quantum number.

Using this assumption, the “stretched state” 3∆3 is represented by the following Slater

determinant:

In this expression, we make explicit the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers d

and s; the index α stands for an electron spin aligned along the molecular axis, σ = +1/2.

The other states can be generated from this one by the application of suitable spin-lowering

operators. We can now act upon wave functions of this type with the single-electron–spin-

orbit operator, by recasting it in terms of operators acting on the individual electrons i:

Details of this procedure are presented in the Appendix. A more thorough treatment of

spin-orbit and rotational coupling will be performed elsewhere [45].

FIG. 2: Hund’s case (c) potential curves for PtH+ (a) and HfH+ (b), labeled by the quantum

number Ω. These curves are obtained from those in Fig.(1) by adding spin-orbit corrections

perturbatively, as described in the text.

The eﬀect of the spin-orbit mixing is to break the degeneracy of the diﬀerent Ω values

and produce a revised set of potential curves, indexed by Hund’s case (c) quantum numbers.

These curves are shown in Fig.(2). Performing these calculations yields values of A =
1680cm−1 and A = 610cm−1 for the molecular spin-orbit constants of PtH+ and HfH+,
−
respectively. This shift is more than enough to push the 3∆3 curve below that of the 1Σ in

PtH+ (Fig.(2a)). Recall that the 1Σ state shifts little in energy because there is no spin or

orbital motion, and therefore any shift in energy must be a second-order eﬀect. The lowest

Ω = 3 curve is solely 3∆3. Additionally, the 3∆3 state of PtH+ is well described in Hund’s

case (a); there are no other states with Ω = 3 nearby in energy (the closest we estimate is

a 3Φ3 state

≈

30,000 cm−1 away that dissociates to the 4F limit of Pt+).

The same results applied to HfH+ tell a diﬀerent story (Fig.(2b)). The value A is not

suﬃciently large to shift the 3∆1 state below the 1Σ0 state. The energy diﬀerence between
Ω = 1 and Ω = 0 states is 600 cm−1. There are other relativistic eﬀects, such as the second-

order correction to the spin-orbit constant and spin-spin and spin-rotation interactions,

that can further push down the 3∆1 state. For example, we can estimate the second-

order–spin-spin parameter in terms of the atomic spin-orbit constant in the pure-precession

approximation [30]. In these heavy elements it is the more dominant contribution to spin-

spin. We ﬁnd

These contribute to an uncertainty of the an order of magnitude smaller than the energy

diﬀerence in the spin-orbit-corrected curves. It is conceivable that the sum total of these

other relativistic eﬀects, acting more strongly on the 3∆ state than on the 1Σ state, will

reverse the ordering in Fig.(2b).

In principle, there is an uncertainty in the computed

electronic energy using MOLPRO, but this is not trivial to estimate. States more subject

to relativistic eﬀects (like 3∆) are less accurately computed compared to a 1Σ state. More

detailed calculations — or, even better, experiments — will be required to decide this issue.

If it turns out that the ground state of HfH+ is 1Σ, then the 3∆1 state is metastable,

and an estimate of its lifetime is desirable. On symmetry grounds we see that this lifetime

should be very long, because of the fact that the transition would require ∆S = 1, ∆Ω = 1

and ∆Λ = 2. J is the total angular momentum about the internuclear axis, J = L + S + N,

where N is the mechanical rotation of the nuclei about their center of mass. The S and

Ω changes are are not dipole allowed in the case (a) basis. However, rotational couplings

do not preserve the value of Ω, and spin-orbit couplings do not preserve the value of S.

Because of such interactions, the molecule is not a pure Hund’s case (a) molecule. The

16

3∆ states may therefore by contaminated by small amplitudes of other case (a) states that

are dipole allowed. These are very small eﬀects and is the reason that these terms are

usually neglected in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For example, we can compute

the amount of contamination the 1Π1 in the 3∆1 state via spin-orbit. This was done to

produce the curves in Fig.(2). Using the eigenvectors of the case (c) Ω = 1 functions we

compute the lifetime to be (

We see that lifetime is on the order of seconds.

D. Estimating ǫs and ǫp; the eﬀective electric ﬁeld

As we have seen, the electric ﬁeld inside a polar diatomic molecule is independent of

the applied electric ﬁeld, provided that the molecule is polarized. There is a relativistic

enhancement factor determined from properties of the heavy atom and a projection of the

electron spin, σ, onto the molecular axis. Now we must determine, according to our working

formula Eq.(22), how much the s and p atomic orbitals are mixed because of the presence

of the other atom.

The values of ǫs and ǫp are obtained from the molecular structure calculations, as de-

scribed above. Wave functions generated for the σ molecular orbital (not to be confused

with the electron-spin projection σ) and presented in Fig.(3). In each panel, the electronic

wave function on the molecular axis is plotted as a function of z, the electron’s coordinate

along this axis (heavy line). For comparison, the s, p, and hydrogen atomic orbitals are

also shown below the molecular orbital wave function. All wave functions are normalized

to unity. Notice that the HfH+ molecular ion in Fig.(3b) is not as strongly mixed as in the

case of PtH+. This small mixing manifests itself as a smaller eﬀective electric ﬁeld for HfH+

(not just due to the Z diﬀerence of 78 to 72). Qualitatively, this asymmetry illustrates the

degree of s-p mixing that is vital to the observed electron EDM shift. By taking appropriate

overlaps of atomic and molecular wave functions, we construct the eﬀective electric ﬁeld as

deﬁned in Sec. III A.

To check the validity of this procedure we have performed the calculations of the expected

presented in Table I. Although the literature values vary by nearly two orders of magnitude,

our present method tracks most of them to within a factor of two.

The lone exception is HBr+. The sign discrepancy between our value and that in Ref.

[12] is analogous to the sign diﬀerence in HI+, as pointed out in Ref.

[13]. Diﬀerences in

the magnitude are likely due to Ref. [12]’s use of an “ionic” bond, whereas HBr+ is neither

purely ionic nor covalent. Our method assumes nothing about the nature of the bond;

rather, it allows the molecular structure software to calculate the electron distribution in

the molecule and then projects the distribution onto atomic orbitals of the heavy atom.

The values we obtain for the eﬀective electric ﬁelds are: 73 GV/cm in the 3∆3 state of
PtH+ and -17 GV/cm in the 3∆1 state of HfH+. Strikingly, these estimates are competitive

with the largest ones previously identiﬁed. This result points to the imperative need for a

complete electronic structure calculation to reﬁne the predictions for these ions.

Finally, at the suggestion of E. Cornell’s group, we have used the same methods to

19

estimate the eﬀective electric ﬁeld for HfF+. Like HfH+, its ground state is a toss-up
between 3∆1 and 1Σ0, and its eﬀective electric ﬁeld is Feﬀ ≈ −

18 GV/cm.

E. Ω-doubling and critical ﬁeld

There remains the question of how easily polarized are the molecular states we have

identiﬁed. The energy diﬀerence between states of diﬀering parity Eq.(13) in a ∆ state is a

fourth order eﬀect in perturbation theory provided the 2S+1Π and 2S+1Σ electronic states are

fairly well separated in energy from the 2S+1∆ state. Brown, et al. [41] have used this idea

to give formulas for estimating the eﬀect in a manner consistent with the ideas of Mulliken

and Christy [40], who worked out the eﬀect in 2Π states. Thus, the Ω-doubling is relegated

to ﬁnding the Λ-doubling (the diﬀerence in energy between parity states comprised of Λ = 2

and Λ =

2).

In a 3∆ state, there are three parameters contributing to the energy splitting designated

˜o∆, ˜p∆, and ˜q∆. The parameters have the following forms

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The 3∆ states of PtH+ and HfH+ satisfy our two most important criteria for experimental

searches of the electron EDM. Both are easily polarized and expected to generate very high

eﬀective internal electric ﬁelds. However, several other experimentally relevant concerns

remain to be resolved for these molecules, including:(1) whether 3∆1 is the true ground
state of HfH+; (2) at what laser wavelengths the molecules can be probed and detected;

and (3) how their magnetic properties, e.g., g-factors, are inﬂuenced by channel couplings

engendered by electric and magnetic ﬁelds and terms neglected in the Born-Oppenheimer
i.e., intermediate coupling via J +S−, etc. These items demand further

approximation;

detailed study, and will be the subject of future work.

We have endeavored to articulate a strategy for estimating the inﬂuence of the electron

EDM on molecular structure, using perturbation theory and nonrelativistic electronic struc-

ture calculation. This strategy has proved quite successful and should be useful to anyone

wishing to assess the viability of a candidate molecule in the future. This estimate does not,

of course, take the place of a complete relativistic many-electron calculation, which must be

done as a follow-up.

There are higher-order eﬀects via coupling to other Ω = 3 electronic states. Yet, the

only other Ω = 3 states come from 3Φ or 5Φ states, which lie far oﬀ in energy. They can

be evaluated to see the second-order contribution to the molecular spin-orbit constant via a

calculation similar to the one below describing the coupling of Ω = 2 states.

Oﬀ-diagonal eﬀects of spin orbit can be evaluated using the same one-electron operators.

These calculations take into account the permutations of the indices within the deter-

electrons in the Slater determinant that belong to paired orbitals. These can, in principle,

contribute via permutations of the indices and raising/lowering the angular momentum.

These types of contributions will be evaluated in future studies.

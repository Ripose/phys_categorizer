Abstract.

Employing a relativistic version of a hypervirial result, recurrence relations for
arbitrary non-diagonal radial hydrogenic matrix elements have recently been ob-
tained in Dirac relativistic quantum mechanics. In this contribution honoring Pro-
fessor L¨owdin, we report on a new relation we have recently discovered between the
matrix elements h2|rλ|1i and h2|βrλ|1i—where β is a Dirac matrix and the numbers
distiguish between diﬀerent radial eigenstates— that allow for a simpliﬁcation and
hence for a more convenient way of expressing the recurrence relations. We addition-
ally derive another relation that can be employed for simplifying two center matrix
element calculations in relativistic atomic or molecular calculations.

Keywords: Relativistic hydrogen atom, relativistic recurrence relations, non-diagonal
matrix elements, two-center matrix elements, hypervirial relations.

Introduction

The evaluation of expectation values is always required for relating quantum
calculations to experimental results in atomic or molecular physics. In most cases
such expectation values can be expressed as matrix elements of powers of a radial
coordinate r; this comes about since these powers can be regarded as either exact
terms in a certain potential (as in the Lennard-Jones, the Casimir or the London
potentials) or as terms in a multipolar expansion of the interaction with the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld [1–5]. Matrix elements of that sort can be also regarded as starting
points of certain useful approximation schemes, like variational or Hartree-Fock or
conﬁguration interaction methods, to which the late Professor L¨owdin made im-
portant contributions [6–14] and which admit relativistic extensions [15–17]. The
treatment of electromagnetic interactions in the realm of multiphoton transitions
in very intense laser ﬁelds usually needs a full quantum electrodynamics treatment
[1], but this is time consuming. As a good approximation we can use instead the
relativistic Dirac quantum mechanical formalism [2]. One has only to remember the
successes this theory has achieved in dealing with the hydrogen atom [18,19]. One
can start with the known states of the relativistic hydrogen atom [18,20–23] and then
proceed, as in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, to expand the states of interest
in terms of the former [24]. The problem is thus reduced to the evaluation of matrix
elements of powers of r between relativistic eigenstates of the hydrogen atom—a
much simpler problem. The bad news are that these evaluations also become cum-

quantum mechanics these techniques in the form of algebraic methods, recurrence
relations or clever uses of hypervirial theorems abound (see, for example,[25–31],
but in the relativistic domain they are rather scarse (but see [4,32–34]). Such lack
of techniques is also manifest in the non existence of relations valid for two center
matrix elements.

The matrix elements of diﬀerent powers of r between Dirac eigenstates of the
hydrogen atom referred to above require the evaluation the following type of integrals

Vk(r) is any radial potential (of scalar type). Please note that here as in all of the
paper we are using atomic units: me = e = ¯h = 1. The quantum number ǫ equals
+1 when l = j + 1/2 and equals −1 when l = j − 1/2 and it is related to the
often used eigenvalue, κ, of the operator β(1 + ΣΣΣ · L) by κ = −ǫ(j + 1/2), where
Σ ≡ diag(σσσ, σσσ) and σσσ = (σx, σy, σz) is the usual 3-vector spin operator. Notice also
that, as in equations (2), (4), and (5) above, we can work in the somewhat easier
to handle 2 dimensional subspace of the 4-dimensional Dirac operators. This choice
has no relevance whatsoever for the ﬁnal results. Closed forms for the integrals (1)
or certain approximations thereof have been given in the Appendix of [38] and in
[34,39,40] but even these become very cumbersome for many uses.

On trying to overcome the complications mentioned above, recurrence rela-
tions which can be used to compute general —not necessarily diagonal— matrix
elements between relativistic hydrogenic states of rλ have recently been obtained

3

[37,38]. Given such recursions, it is only needed to evaluate at most 6 matrix ele-
ments, 3 for rλ and 3 more for βrλ, for obtaining every other matrix element of rλ
or of βrλ between hydrogenic states.

In this contribution honoring the memory of Professor L¨owdin and his work, we
want to review these recurrence relations and to discuss one more relation, previously
unnoticed to us, which can greatly simplify the use of the recurrence relations already
reported. Other purpose of this contribution is to derive an hypervirial-like formula
that can be useful for evaluating relativistic two center matrix elements.

The previously known recurrence relations

The recurrence formulae have been obtained rederiving in the relativistic realm
a non-relativistic hypervirial result previously used to derive the Blanchard recur-
sion relations between hydrogenic matrix elements of rα terms [41,42]. The non-
relativistic Blanchard relation has been found so interesting that it has been gener-
alized [39]. We have to point out that our relativistic approach is totally diﬀerent
from Blanchard’s; we start constructing an hypervirial and then proceed with several
relativistic identities that have led us to the recurrence relations we are after [37,38].
This approach is inspired in a technique previously employed for similar purposes in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics [41].

To obtain a relativistically valid recurrence relation, let us ﬁrst compute matrix
elements of the radial function ξ(r) = H2f (r) − f (r)H1, where Hi is one of the
Hamiltonians—these are really the same Hamiltonian just evaluated in any of the
two states 1 or 2—appearing in Eq. (3), to obtain,

The new recurrence relations

Relations (9) and (12) can be useful for diﬀerent computations, but they could
be even more so if we could disentangle the matrix elements of ra from the matrix
elements of βrb. This can be achieved with the help of the following relationship

as follows from equation (8) by using the above illustrated technique but with dif-
ferent substitutions. Notice that we have reverted to an arbitrary radial function

f (r) and a generic radial potential V (r). Now using, as we did before, the speciﬁc
function f (r) = rλ and the Coulomb potential V (r) = −Z/r, we obtain the useful
new relationship

Equation (18) is fundamental for the disentanglement of the recurrence relations
(10) and (14).

Let us explain now the process for disentangling the matrix elements of rλ
from those of βrλ. We ﬁrst obtain hn2 j2 ǫ2|rλ|n1 j1 ǫ1i from equation (16) and from
equation (14); by equating the resulting expressions, we get the recurrence relation
for terms of the form hn2 j2 ǫ2|βrλ|n1 j1 ǫ1i, as

Equation (20) is, together with the deﬁnitions (21), the new recursion for matrix
elements involving just β rb.

To obtain the recursion for the matrix elements of ra, we start with equations
(10) and (18). We ﬁrst obtain the three hn2 j2 ǫ2|βrλ−i|n1 j1 ǫ1i (i = 0, 1, 2) terms
from them; next we succesively substitute them into equation (14) and, by juggling

Equation (22) is the recursion involving only matrix elements of ra.

The new recurrence relations are equations (20) and (22), we also think that
equation (19) can be found useful in certain applications. We must also pinpoint that
the relationships derived are valid in general for complex values of the exponent λ, as
(ji + 1/2)2 − Z 2α2
long as ω1 +ω2 +|λ| > −1, were the numbers ωi are deﬁned as
F .
This property was established in [38].

A relation for two-center integrals.

The recurrence relations established above for relativistic hydrogenic states is
suﬃciently general for performing many calculations. It is not however useful for

8

(23)

(24)

calculations involving matrix elements of a radial function between states represented
by radial eigenstates corresponding to diﬀerent potential functions, that is, the so-
called two center matrix elements. It is the purpose of this section to present one
such relation for relativistic two-center matrix elements that can be regarded as a
ﬁrst step in the appropriate direction. This will be done using ideas developed in
[38,41,43].

General hypervirial results, the virial theorem, and other algebraic techniques
[25,26,44] have been always very useful for calculating matrix elements, nonetheless
they have been little used in relativistic calculations (but see [37,44,45]). We want
to show here that they can have comparable importance than in non-relativistic
quantum calculations. So, let us consider two radial Dirac Hamiltonians [as in equa-
tion (3)] with two possibly diﬀerent radial scalar potentials V1(r) and V2(r)—we are
thinking on potentials like those describing vibrational states in a molecule—

H1 =cαr[pr − iβǫ1(j1 + 1/2)/r] + βc2 + V1(r),
H2 =cαr[pr − iβǫ2(j2 + 1/2)/r] + βc2 + V2(r),

a further assumption we make is that the two potentials are displaced from their
respective equilibrium points by a constant quantity, i. e. r1 + r2 = a, where ri
is the equilibrium position of potential Vi(r) and a the displacement. Notice that,
at diﬀerence with equation (3), here the numerical label in the Hamiltonians is not
just convenient but has a deﬁnite physical meaning, for H2 and H1 refer to two in
principle diﬀerent systems.

Taking the diﬀerence between the Hamiltonians (25), H1 − H2, we get

H1 = H2 + icαrβ

− (V2(r) − V1(r)) .

On employing (25), we can inmediately evaluate the commutator

[H1, f2(r)] = −icαr

df2(r)
dr

where f2(r) is an arbitrary radial function and [H, f (r)] stands for the commuta-
tor between H and f (r). We can calculate this commutator again, but now using
expression (26) to get the alternative form

[H1, f2(r)] = H2f2(r) − f2(r)H1 − (V2 − V1) f2(r) + icαrβ

notice, however, that the energy eigenvalues in (29) refer to the diﬀerent Hamilto-
nians (26), and not to diﬀerent states of the same Hamiltonian—as was the case
analysed in the ﬁrst section of the paper [compare with equation (6)]. In fact, if we
consider the same potentials in equation (29), i. e. we take V2(r) = V1(r), we are
also inmediately setting E1 = E2 and thus we recover the relationship (6), which is
valid for just one center.

The important point is that equation (29) is an exact relation valid for the
calculation of two center matrix elements, given as a function of the eigenenergies
for any two scalar radial potentials Vi(r) in the Dirac equation, and thus it can be
useful for deriving recurrence relations between such matrix elements. But this is
still a work in progress.

The two-center Dirac equation for an electron in the ex-
ternal electromagnetic ﬁeld of two colliding heavy ions in the
limit in which the ions are moving at the speed of light is ex-
actly solved and nonperturbative amplitudes for free electron-
positron pair production are obtained. We ﬁnd the condition
for the applicability of this solution for large but ﬁnite colli-
sion energy, and use it to explain recent experimental results.
The observed scaling of positron yields as the square of the
projectile and target charges is a result of an exact cancel-
lation of a nonperturbative charge dependence and holds as
well for large coupling. Other observables would be sensitive
to nonperturbative phases.

There is a very small number of problems in physics
that yield to an exact solution. Remarkably, electro-
magnetic production of free electron-positron pairs in
the high-energy limit of peripheral, heavy-ion collisions
can be described by a two-center, time-dependent Dirac
equation which can be solved exactly and in closed form
[1]. In this Letter, we study this exact solution and dis-
cuss its implications for recent experiments performed at
CERN’s SPS [2], and possible future experiments at new
facilities such as BNL’s RHIC and CERN’s LHC. (See
Refs. [3,4] for relevant reviews of this ﬁeld.)

T Z 2

Perturbative calculations have been held suspect at
high energies and for the heaviest projectiles, e.g. because
the coupling constant is not small (Zα ∼ 0.6) [2–6]. It
is therefore surprising that positron yields observed from
pair production in peripheral collisions of Pb82+ ions at
33-TeV on a Au target scale as Z 2
P , and that the ob-
served positron-momentum distributions display an over-
all good agreement with the leading-order perturbation-
theory calculations [2]. The exact nonperturbative solu-
tion presented here explains these eﬀects and is also con-
sistent with the observed enhancement of the positron
yields at small positron momentum. For future exper-
iments, we indicate what observables would show com-
plete agreement with second-order perturbation theory,
and what other observables should be measured in order
to detect nonperturbative eﬀects.

The relativistic scattering problem of an electron in the
external ﬁeld of two point-like charges (ions), moving on
parallel, straight-line trajectories in opposite directions
at speeds which approach the speed of light, and at an
impact parameter 2~b, reduces in the high-energy limit to

charges, ZA and ZB. (γ in the collider frame is related to
γT in the target frame by γT = 2γ2 − 1.) Equation (1) is
written in the collider frame, with natural units (c = 1,
me = 1, and ¯h = 1), α is the ﬁne-structure constant, and
ˇα and ˇγµ are Dirac matrices in the Dirac representation.
The δ-function form of the interaction is a high-energy
limit of the exact interaction in a short-range represen-
tation for the electron’s Dirac-spinor, chosen to remove
the interaction at asymptotic times [7–9].

For Eq. (1) to apply, one assumes ﬁrst that the ions
are suﬃciently energetic and massive so that the devia-
tion from straight-line trajectories can be neglected [4].
Second, one assumes peripheral collisions without nuclear
interaction. Purely electromagnetic events can be distin-
guished experimentally from nuclear events by observing
the full-energy projectile ion after the collision in coinci-
dence with the produced electrons or positrons [2]. One
also assumes the ions are moving at the speed of light. In-
deed, for the recent experiments at CERN [2], β ≈ 0.99,
and for future experiments possible at RHIC, β ≈ 0.9999.
Finally, to obtain the δ-function form of the interaction,
one assumes that γ ≫ |~r⊥ ± ~b|, and 2b.

Equation (1) displays a unique electromagnetic in-
teraction. The ion with charge ZA is moving to the
Its electromagnetic poten-
right at the speed of light.
tial in the representation chosen here is Lorentz con-
tracted to the plane transverse to its trajectory, (the
light front z = t), hence the δ(z − t) functional de-
pendence. Likewise, the ion with charge ZB carries
with it at the other light front, (z = −t), a plane of
singular interaction moving to the left at the speed of
light. Anywhere but on the light fronts, Eq. (1) re-
duces to the free Dirac equation. The Dirac plane waves
{|χp(~r, t)i = exp(−iEpt) exp(i~r ·~p)|upi} which satisfy the
free Dirac equation are each characterized by the quan-
tum numbers p ≡ {~p, λp, sp}; the momentum ~p, the sign

of the energy Ep = (−1)λp
p2 + 1, and the spin sp = ±.
Explicit forms for the four four-spinors |upi are given in

The scattering problem for the electron is deﬁned by
Eq. (1) and by plane-wave asymptotic initial and ﬁnal
states. One solves for the transition amplitude A(j)

k stands for integration over ~k and summation

over λk and sk. We have obtained an exact, closed-form
integral representation for the scattering amplitude A(j)
k
in the following manner [1]. First we have observed that,
as the ions are approaching from inﬁnity, no change oc-
curs in the region of space between them (|z| < |t|) until
t = 0 when the two singular interaction planes collide.
However, as each ion sweeps through space, it interacts
with the single plane wave it encounters, resulting in a
superposition of plane waves after it passes. Each δ-
function interaction induces a phase-shift discontinuity
in the wavefunction across each light front [7,8,1]. A
phase shift induced on a plane wave by the passage of a
single ion is not suﬃcient to produce pairs, but as the
two phase-shift planes collide at t = 0, they interfere,
and pairs are produced as a result. After the collision
(t > 0), as the ions move apart, the solution in the space
between them (|z| < t) is a new superposition of plane
waves which is determined by the nontrivial boundary
condition at the light fronts. We have calculated the
transition amplitudes A(j)
k by integrating the ﬂux of the
conserved transition four-current which ﬂows into this
region across the light fronts. Two terms contribute to
the amplitude corresponding to the two time orderings
of the interaction of the electronic wavefunction with the
two ions.

The transition amplitudes, A(j)

k , are represented in
terms of the transverse-momentum transfer distribution
induced by a single ion, Q~b
Z(~κ), which contains all the
dynamics of the ion-electron interaction. When λk = 0
and λj = 1, A(j)
is an amplitude for a transition from
k
the negative continuum to the positive continuum, i.e. an
amplitude for pair production. We have found [1],

The branch-point singularities for the intermediate mo-
mentum ~p⊥ = ~k⊥ or ~j⊥ are an artifact of using Eq. (5) for
~κ = 0. (The integral over ~p⊥ in Eq. (3) has no singulari-
ties.) We continue the analysis assuming an appropriate
regularization at these points.

Equation (6) is nonperturbative, and already includes
the interaction to all orders in αZ for any value αZ may
have. Yet, its form is very similar to the high-energy
limit of results obtained from the two-photon exchange
diagrams of second-order perturbation theory [5], (which
in the following we simply call the perturbative result).
For high-energy collisions, there is therefore no reason to
calculate higher order diagrams. As γ → ∞, the only
corrections to second-order perturbation theory calcula-
tions for free-pair production, including both higher or-
ders and nonperturbative eﬀects, are the phases in the
square brackets. For small values of αZ, these phases
tend to 1 and the perturbative limit is reproduced [1].
What are the observable nonperturbative eﬀects for ﬁ-
nite charges? The phase in the square brackets outside
the integral over ~p⊥ has no physical implications, but
the phases in the integrands may substantially alter the

2

physical predictions. We ﬁnd, for example, that the high-
energy limit for |A(j)
diﬀers, in general, from the per-

turbative result. On the other hand, using Eq. (6) to

lation of the nonperturbative phases, as
~p′) = (2π)2δ(~p′). We conclude that while some observ-
ables are sensitive to the nonperturbative phases, other
observables are not, e.g. because these phases are aver-
aged to one by an integration. In these cases, observed
results would agree with the second-order perturbation
theory calculations, regardless of the size of αZ.

R

Would our results apply in an actual experiment,
where γ is ﬁnite? Equation (1) is incorrect for large r⊥
(or large b) where it describes an interaction which con-
tinually increases in strength. Implicit in using Eq. (1)
for large, ﬁnite γ is a nontrivial assumption that large,
transverse distances do not contribute to pair produc-
tion.
In the recent experiments at CERN [2], γ ≈ 10,
while in possible future experiments at RHIC and LHC,
γ ≈ 100 and γ ≈ 3000, respectively. For these values
of γ, Eq. (1) is respectively limited to pairs produced
at transverse distances much smaller than 10, 100, and
3000 Compton wavelengths away from the ions. This re-
striction is consistent with an experimental observation
according to which the average length scale for pair pro-
duction in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is one Comp-
ton wavelength [2]. Yet, being concerned here not with
averages but with complete distributions, we can not ex-
clude the possibility of some pairs being produced at
large, transverse distances from the highly charged ions,
as long as the transverse-momentum transferred is suf-
ﬁciently small. For Eq. (5) to be meaningful, the regu-
lated integral of Eq. (4) must converge to the expression
of Eq. (5) for ξ such that |~r⊥ − ~b| ≪ γ. The case of
small coupling was previously studied [1]. The case of
large αZ can be considered by the method of stationary
phase. Expansion of Eq. (4) around the stationary point
~r⊥ − ~b = 2αZ~κ/κ2 conﬁrms Eq. (5) for this case. The
procedure is consistent if the stationary point is located
at small distances from the ion, i.e. if and only if

It is interesting to ﬁnd that Eq. (8) is trivially satisﬁed
in two very diﬀerent limits: in the perturbative limit of
αZ → 0 and in the high-energy limit of γ → ∞.

Thus, the results which we have ﬁrst obtained for in-
ﬁnite γ, apply for ﬁnite γ as well. The only restriction
is of Eq. (8), i.e. that the transverse-momentum trans-
fer is not too small. For pair production, it is a suﬃ-
cient condition to assume that either the initial or ﬁnal
(i.e. positron or electron) transverse-momenta are much
larger than 2αZ/γ where Z is the largest free charge in-
volved in the collision. The argument goes as follows.
There are three two-dimensional integration variables in
Eq. (3). We ﬁrst integrate over ~p⊥ to obtain simple com-
binations of the Bessel functions of the third kind, K0 and
K1. We then use the condition that one of the two trans-
verse momenta, ~j⊥ or ~k⊥, is much larger than 2αZ/γ to
apply a stationary phase calculation to one of the coor-
dinate integrations.
If, on the other hand, one of the
charges is screened (a target charge, for example) the in-
tegral with it converges and there is no need to restrict
the momentum conjugate to it. The last integral, over
the other coordinate-integration variable, converges due
to the Bessel functions which drop exponentially for large
values of their arguments. Having thus proved that con-
tributions for the 6-fold integral of Eq. (3) from large,
transversal coordinates can be neglected, we can make
the substitution of Eq. (5) and obtain Eq. (6). We re-
mark that the convergence of the ~p⊥ integration to the
Bessel functions occurs only for pair-production ampli-
tudes for which 1 − j±k∓ > 0, and is directly related to
the mass gap between the two continua.
It should be
reconsidered for transitions within the same continuum.
We now consider the application of our results to the
discussion of recent, pioneering experiments on pair pro-
duction performed at CERN’s SPS [2]. These experi-
ments measured momentum spectra of positrons emitted
from pair production in peripheral collisions of 33-TeV
Pb82+ ions (γT = 168) and 6.4 TeV S16+ ions (γT = 212)
with various targets (i.e. (CH2)x, Al, Pd, and Au). The
charge dependence of the positron yield was reported
with excellent precision. The target-charge dependence
for the sulfur projectile is Z1.99±0.02
, and for the lead pro-
jectile is Z2.03±0.03
; both within ∼ 1% agreement with the
prediction of perturbation theory. The projectile-charge
dependence was observed to be Z2.0±0.1
, also in very good
agreement with perturbation theory. The positron mo-
mentum distributions for sulfur and lead projectiles are
compared by scaling each spectrum by Z 2
P , and by scal-
ing the sulfur data from γT = 212 to γT = 168 as ln3(γT ),
as predicted by perturbation theory. The scaled distribu-
tions are observed to be approximately the same, and to
agree reasonable well with two-photon perturbation the-
ory (see discussion in [2]), except for enhancements for
the lead projectile at very low (< 2 MeV/c) and high (be-
tween 8 MeV/c and 12 MeV/c) momentum. The authors
of Ref. [2] note that the variation of the scaled momen-

T

tum distribution with the projectile charge, and not the
target charge, is unexplained.

T Z 2

The observed Z 2

P charge dependence of the single-
positron yields, even for very large charges, is consis-
tent with the charge dependence we have obtained for
the nonperturbative, high-energy limit (see Eq. (7)). It
agrees with perturbation theory but is not a perturbative
eﬀect. Nonperturbative phases in the exact amplitudes
make them diﬀerent from second-order perturbation the-
ory results, but these phases cancel for calculations of
total cross sections. Our theoretical prediction of a Z 2
dependence of the total cross section in the high-energy
limit implies that multiple-pair production in very high-
energy collisions cannot be inferred from a measurement
of the charge dependence of the total positron yield [2].
We suggest that the two regions of excess cross section
observed in the experiment have a common origin: an
enhancement over perturbation theory for small values
of the transverse-momentum transfer, for which Eq. (4)
diverges. We found that agreement with the perturba-
tive result is restricted by Eq. (8). Assuming that in the
collider frame pairs are produced isotropically, this re-
striction, formulated for the transverse momentum, may
translate to a restriction on the total positron momen-
tum: j⊥ ∼ jz ∼ j >> 2ZP α/γ. Taking >> to be a
factor of 10, we then predict, in very good agreement
with the observed scaled spectra, that the perturbative
result for the positron momentum distributions is valid
for j > 0.4 MeV/c for the sulfur data, and j > 2 MeV/c
for the lead data. The excess cross section observed at
high momentum for the lead projectile is consistent with
an enhancement in the cross section at low transverse
momentum in the collider frame after a relativistic trans-
formation to the target frame is applied. The absence of
an observed target-charge dependence for the scaled dis-
tributions, is most likely attributable to screening by the
atomic electrons [11].

In conclusion, we have shown that the exact, non-
perturbative solution and the two-photon exchange di-
agrams of second-order perturbation theory give exactly
the same results for free-pair production yields integrated
over the impact parameter, as long as the transverse-
momenta transferred from the ions to the electron are
larger than 2αZ/γ. The leading-order perturbative cal-
culations for this observable are therefore exact not only
at the perturbative limit of αZ ≪ 1 but also in the high-
energy limit of γ ≫ 1. This explains recent experimen-
tal results according to which production rates scale as
Z 2
T , even for large charges. New nonperturbative ef-
fects could be detected by measuring observables diﬀer-
ent from the integrated, inclusive production rate that
was measured in these experiments. The exact ampli-
tudes of Eq. (6) include nonperturbative phases which
may have an observable eﬀect, e.g. if one does not in-
tegrate over the impact parameter ~2b. We expect these
phases to strongly inﬂuence the theoretical predictions

P Z 2

for correlations and multiple-pair production. Several is-
sues deserve further study. These include pair production
at large, transverse distances from the ions and bound-
free production for which one should obtain the solution
on the light fronts themselves. For other calculations,
Eq. (6) as well as the physical picture that led to it, are
likely to become useful theoretical tools [12].

Abstract

We consider diﬀerent options for the search for possible variations of the fundamental constants. We give
a brief overview of the results obtained with several methods. We discuss their advantages and disadvantages
with respect to simultaneous variations of all constants in both time and space in the range 108
− 1010 yr.
We also suggest a few possibilities for the laboratory search. Particularly, we propose some experiments
with the hyperﬁne structure of hydrogen, deuterium and ytterbium–171 and of some atoms with a small
magnetic moment. Other suggestions are for some measurements of the ﬁne structure associated with the
ground state. Special attention is paid to the interpretation of the hfs measurements in terms of variations
of the fundamental constants.

Introduction

There is no physical reason to expect that the “fundamental constants” are really constant quantities. Indeed,
their variations have to have a cosmological scale. Since the publishing of a famous Dirac paper [1] a number
of diﬀerent hypotheses on their possible variations have been suggested as well as a number of trial to search
for these. A review of old models and searches could be found e. g.
[2]. We live in an expanding
universe and an accepted contemporary picture of the history of our universe assumes that there were a few
phase transitions with spontaneous breaking of some symmetries during the early stages of evolution (inﬂation
model) [3].

in Ref.

We consider here only atomic and nuclear properties and the variations of the fundamental constants that
can be determined from changes in such properties. We do not discuss variation of the gravitational constant (a
review on that can be found in Refs. [2, 4]). There are two reasons for that. First of all, in looking for variations
of nuclear and atomic properties (magnetic moments, masses, decay rates) it is not possible to consider strong,
weak and electromagnetic eﬀects independently. Next, from a theoretical point of view, we have to expect that
the variations of strong, weak and electromagnetic coupling constants are strongly correlated. In contrast to
that, any investigation for possible variations of the gravitational interaction can be done separately.

1.1 Variation of the constants and atomic spectroscopy

Any search for a possible variation of the fundamental constants can be actually performed measuring some
atomic, molecular and nuclear properties and it is necessary to discuss relations between them. There are three
very diﬀerent kinds of atomic and molecular transitions, available for precision spectroscopy:

†The summer address

• Gross structure is associated with transitions between levels with diﬀerent values of the principal number
n. They have a scaling behaviour as α2 me c2/h or Ry. It has to be remembered that for any atom with
two or more electrons, one has to introduce an eﬀective quantum number n∗, which is a function of the
orbital momentum (l). The nonrelativistic behaviour α2 me c2/h is actually associated with n∗(l) and,
hence, in non-hydrogen-like atoms, transitions between levels with diﬀerent value of l are also a part of
the gross structure.

• Atomic ﬁne structure, or separations of levels with the same n∗(l) and diﬀerent spin-orbit coupling (e. g.
diﬀerent j or diﬀerent sum of spin of valence electrons), has a scaling behaviour α4 m c2/h or α2 Ry. That
is part of relativistic corrections, which have the same order of magnitude.

• Atomic hyperﬁne structure is a splitting due to a magnetic moment of the nucleus (µ) and it is proportional

to α4 m c2/h (µ/µb) or α2 (µ/µb) Ry.

Comparing frequencies with diﬀerent scaling behaviour, one can look for variations of the fundamental
constants and nuclear magnetic moments. An important part of those comparisons is the so-called absolute
frequency measurements. An absolute measurement of a frequency is actually its comparison to the hfs of Cs,
because of the deﬁnition of second via the Cs hfs interval

νhfs(133Cs) = 9 9192 631.770 kHz

(exactly) .

(1)

Another possibility is to study some corrections. E. g. the study of relativistic corrections to the atomic gross
structure or hfs can yield to detection of possible variations of the ﬁne structure constants, while investigations
of the electronic-vibrational-rotational lines can give limitations for the variation of the proton-to-nuclear mass
ratio. Due to the importance of the value in Eq.(1) let us to discuss corrections to the hfs in some detail. The
value of the hyperﬁne splitting in an atomic state can be presented in the form

νhfs = c0 α2 µ
µb

Ry Frel(α) ,

(2)

where µ stands for the nuclear magnetic moment, c0 is a constant speciﬁc for the atomic state and all dependence
on α is contained in a function Frel(α), which is also speciﬁc for the state. The function is associated with the
relativistic corrections and Frel(0) = 1. The corrections are more important for high Z and in the case of low
Z (e. g. for the hydrogen hfs) they are negligible.

1.2 Variable particle, atomic and nuclear properties

There are three possibilities for the variation of fundamental properties, which can be studied within spectro-
scopic methods:

• eﬀects due to electromagnetic interactions and value of electromagnetic coupling constant α (study of

1s − 2s, comparison of the gross and ﬁne structure, study of relativistic corrections);

• eﬀects of quark-quark and quark-gluon strong interactions and nucleon properties like µp, µn, mp etc

(study of the hfs of hydrogen and light nuclei, or molecular electronic-vibrational-rotational lines);

• nuclear properties (moments and masses) due to the structure of heavy nuclei. Some of those properties
(like magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments) can be studied by means of atomic and molecular
spectroscopy. Nuclear decay rates and scattering cross sections of nuclear collisions can be investigated
by other methods.

We mainly consider here applications of the precision spectroscopy. Experiments with the hfs of heavy
atoms (e. g. Cs, Rb, Yb+ or Hg+) cannot have any clear interpretation: any of the values are proportional to
a non-relativistic matrix element, but with signiﬁcant relativistic corrections (see Eq.(2)). The non-relativistic
value is proportional to a magnetic moment of the nucleus, which includes the moments of one or two valence
protons and neutrons and some contribution of an internal nuclear motion. The last is not a pure eﬀect of the
strong interactions and an inﬂuence of electromagnetic interactions can be estimated from the proton-neutron
asymmetry.

If we keep in mind a general picture, we have to expect a kind of “grand uniﬁcation” theory and there has
to be some direct relations between coupling constants for weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions (see
e. g. [5, 3]). Hence, all fundamental constants (i. e. α, αs and αw) are expected to vary within about the same

2

rate. Indeed, diﬀerent atomic, molecular or nuclear properties can have quite diﬀerent sensitivities to variations
of the coupling constants.

It is necessary to emphasise that it is incorrect to think that some values like proton-electron mass ratio or
nuclear g-factor are expected to be relatively constant, while the electromagnetic coupling constant α varies,
as is expected in the interpretation of some papers. The bare electron mass is a result of the interaction with
the Higgs ﬁeld [6] and it has signiﬁcant quantum electrodynamical corrections due to the renormalization. The
bare u- and d-quark masses also appear from the Standard model as a result of interaction with the Higgs sector
and are a few Mev. However, the actual masses of the proton and neutron are determined by the masses of the
constituent quarks, which are about 300 Mev and those values are completely a result of the dynamic eﬀects of
the QCD in a strong coupling range. The same is true with the proton and neutron magnetic moments. Such
a value, appearing as a result of the strong interactions, is deﬁnitely a function of the strong coupling constant,
which is expected to vary together with the electromagnetic and weak coupling constants.

Let us consider the electron mass in more detail. A standard interpretation of quantum electrodynamics
(QED) is that it has to be possible to explain all low-energy (with respect to the Planck mass Mp) physical
phenomena, using only few eﬀective low-energy parameters (like renormalized electron mass and charge etc).
The origin of those values is not important. However, in the case of the search for variations of the constants
it is necessary to study the origin of the low-energy parameters, like the electron mass. The bare electron mass
m0 is to be renormalized due to the QED eﬀects. In the one-loop approximation on can ﬁnd

me = m0"1 +

3
4

α
π

ln(cid:18) Λ

m0(cid:19)2# ,

(3)

where the Λ is an eﬀective cut-oﬀ of the ultraviolet divergence. If the cut-oﬀ is associated with the Planck scale
Λ = Mp ∼ 1.2 · 1019 Gev ∼ 2.4 · 1021 me, the logarithmic correction is about 20% of the leading term. One can
see that, even in the case of a constant value of m0, the actual electron mass me has to vary with α.
From a theoretical point of view we can rather expect a primary variation of some parameters which are
not visible directly in our low-energy world and this forces some secondary variations of the coupling constants.
E. g. in the inﬂatory universe (see Ref.
[3] for detail), some eﬀective Higgs potentials depend on the average
temperature, which is a function of the time. That have led to some phase transition in the past, when the
hot universe was cooling. We think that even in our “cool” universe we can expect some slow time variation of
those Higgs potentials and perhaps their long-scale space variation. The variations of the constants is to be a
direct consequence of that.

Another and more sophisticated idea [7] was proposed due to the so-called Kaluza-Klein theories, which are
associated with a world of 4 + N dimensions. In contrast to “our” 4 dimensions, the extra spatial N dimensions
form a compact manifold with a radius Rkk about Planck length (∼ 10−33 cm). While our four dimensional
universe is expanding, Marciano suggested that value of Rkk is also not constant. However, in the Kaluza-Klein
theory this value is associated with the coupling constants of our world.

So, we expect that the variation of diﬀerent coupling constants has to have the same scale. However, it
is necessary to remember that due to the strong coupling any eﬀective parameters coming from the strong
interactions, can have a kind of random variation. We cannot often know which quantity is varied more (or less)
rapidly than the fundamental constants. That is why we have to try with several ways as diﬀerent as possible.
No model on a possible dependence of the values of the fundamental constants has not been assumed in
our paper. However, we must underline, that we consider a picture of simultaneous variations of all coupling
constants, which particularly determine all property of particles, nuclei, atoms and molecules.

We have not yet speciﬁed a term “variations”. To our mind there are actually two possibilities for those:
• A time and/or space variation over all the universe with a cosmological scale (T ∼ 1010 yr and L ∼ c· 1010

yr).

• Time and/or space ﬂuctuations over some less, but signiﬁcantly cosmological, scale (T ∼ 108 − 109 yr and

L ∼ c · (108 − 109) yr).

Such a ﬂuctuation of the gravitation interaction was considered [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] due to a periodicity in the
galaxies distributions in the direction of the Galactic north and south poles [14]. The ﬂuctuations of gravitation
is also one of the explanations of possible variations to the solar year [12].

The variation can be induced e. g. by cooling of the universe and a variation of some eﬀective Higgs
potentials. We have no a priori estimation for the speed of the variations. We expect the cosmological time
and space scale (T and L), but we have no idea on the amplitude of the possible variations. The expected

3

amplitude particularly depends on our assumption if we expect some kind of a primary direct variation of the
constants, or their variations are a consequence of variations of some other parameters. E. g.
let us pretend
that the primary variation is due to the compactiﬁcation radius Rkk and there is no variation of the coupling
constants on the unperturbed level. Nevertheless, the variations have to appear due to the renormalization and
the time-dependence is to be of the relative order α ln Rkk(t). Particularly, following QED one can ﬁnd in the
one-loop approximation an expression for the ﬁne structure constant

α =

1 − 1

3

α0

π Pj cj q2

α0

j ln(cid:0)Λ/mj(cid:1)2 ,

(4)

where Λ ≃ ¯h/cRkk, the sum is over all fundamental charged particles (leptons, quarks, W -bosons, Higgs
particles etc), mj stands for their masses, qj is for their charges. The coeﬃcient cj is dependent on their spin
and particularly for 1/2 it is equal to one. A signiﬁcant variation of Rkk (e. g. 1%) can induce a variation of
α only on a level between 10−4 − 10−5. The extra α and the logarithm reduce the amplitude of the variation
dramatically. However, it is important to note, that the variation of the mass in Eq.(3) with Λ = Rkk(t) and
of the charge in Eq.(4) are to be of the same origin and of about the same order. That example shows that the
variation ∆α/α can be small and that the mass variation ∆m/m and the coupling constant variation can be of
the same order and vary simultaneously. Actually comparing Eqs.(3) and (4) one can note that the variation
of the mass can be larger, smaller or of the same order of magnitude as the variation of the coupling constant.
Mass variations smaller or of the same order as the coupling constant have been discussed above. The larger
mass variation can appear if we suggest that there is no direct variation of the coupling constants, but the
masses vary e. g. due to some variation of the eﬀective Higgs potential of the Standard Model. The α-variation
has to appear from Eq.(4) because of the m-variation in the logarithm. We conclude that a priori it is not
feasible to dismiss the mass variation and to consider only varying coupling constants.

2 Non-laboratory search for variations of the fundamental constants

2.1 Geochemical data and nuclear properties

Nuclear reactions (collisions, decay etc) often involve some relatively small diﬀerences of large contributions.
E. g. to understand if any isotope is stable for a particular channel of decay, one has to compare the initial
and ﬁnal binding energy. A problem of the stability is a problem of this diﬀerence, which is sometimes quite
small. Relatively small shifts in particle masses or coupling constants can make the decay of a stable isotope
possible, or disturb an allowed decay. The variation of the coupling constant of strong, electromagnetic or weak
interactions can be weakly limited, but the geochemical estimations take advantage of long term comparisons.
The study of the abundance of some isotopes allows one to make a comparisons over a geophysical scale of 109
yr.

2.1.1 Geochemical data

Some estimations of possible variations of the coupling constants of strong, weak and electromagnetic interac-
tions from geophysical, or rather, geochemical data were performed in Refs.
[15, 16, 18, 17, 19, 2, 21, 22, 23]
(see review in Refs. [2, 4] for more references). Some examinations also include data on the abundance of some
isotopes in the meteorites, and so the results are, in part, astrochemical ones.

The typical limits are

One problem with the interpretation of those data is the authors assumed of Refs. [2, 18, 20, 21, 22] that only
coupling constants vary, while the masses of the proton, the neutron and the electron are constant. Conversely,
we expect those to vary as well, and some nuclear eﬀects are sensitive to that variation. Particularly, the β-decay
must be very sensitive to their diﬀerence

mn − mp − me .

4

We should remember that often the violation of the isotopic invariance and particularly the small diﬀerence of
the proton and neutron masses

mn − mp

mp

∼ 0.14%

(6)

is associated with electromagnetic eﬀects.

Next, it was assumed that it is possible to look for a variation of some particular constant (e. g. α) while
others are really constant. We cannot accept such an evaluation, but nevertheless we would like to underline,
that the nuclear property can be very sensitive to a variation of the constants, because the decay rates are
strongly dependent on the transition energy, which is actually a small diﬀerence of two larger energies of initial
and ﬁnal states. Both include contributions of the electromagnetic interactions and the diﬀerence can be quite
sensitive to these.

Another important problem is timing. Geochemical clocks are based on the study of the abundance of some
long-living isotopes and others associated with them. A long lifetime is a result of a small value of the transition
either matrix element or energy. Both, being small, are sensitive to the same variation of the constants. To the
best of our knowledge there have been no discussions on a correlation between the clock and the variation.

2.1.2 Geochemical data from Oklo reactor

Shlyakhter [24] introduced two important elements in the study of nuclear reactions. First, he pointed out
that laboratory investigations of nuclear property can also give reasonable limitations (see section 3.1). His
other idea was due to the recently discovered Oklo Fossil reactor in Gabon (West Africa). That is a natural
ﬁssion reactor (see review in Refs.
[25, 26]), and conditions for its existence are very narrow. Investigating
those conditions and the local abundance of diﬀerent isotopes (particularly Sm) it is possible to derive some
limitations such that it had operated 1.7 billions years ago for a period from 0.6 to 1.5 millions years. The
limits from Ref. [24] are

(7)

One evidence of the operation of the nuclear reactor in the past was isotope compositions of some elements
like samarium, europium and gadolinium. Some of their isotopes (149Sm, 151Eu, 155Gd and 157Gd) are strong
neutron absorbers and they have been found in very small quantities with respect to the natural abundance.
They have simply been burned by the ﬂux of thermal neutrons. A study of such isotopes can give information
on the fundamental constants at a time when the fossil reactor was operating. Particularly, the limitations in
Eqs.(7) have appeared because of the resonance

149Sm + n → 150Sm + γ ,

(8)

which has an energy of only 97.3 meV. Two isotopes of samarium (147 and 149) have been studied. The halftime
of the isotopes is presented in Table 11. The cross sections of reaction in Eq.(8) and a similar one for

147Sm + n → 148Sm + γ ,

(9)

diﬀer by about two orders of magnitude because of the resonance. Studying the 147Sm/149Sm ratio one can
deduce a possible variation of the position of the resonance from when the reactor was operating to the present
day. The strength of the limitations in Eqs.(7) has three reasons:

• the sensitivity of the abundance of samarium isotopes to the position of the resonance;
• the fact that the resonance energy (∼ 100 meV) has to be compared with a well of the nuclear potential

(∼ 50 Mev) i. e. it is 5 · 108 times larger then the energy;

• large time separation (∼ 2 · 109 yr).

After publication of Ref. [24] the Oklo data have been re-evaluated by a number of authors [26, 28, 4, 29, 30].
The evaluations were concentrated on the samarium abundance. Particularly, it was pointed out in Ref.
[30]
that for the limitations for the strong coupling constant it is unlikely to be appropriate to compare the position
of the resonance to the well of the nucleon-nucleon potential, which is essentially of use only in the few-body
problem. In the case of many-body eﬀect (like the resonance) it was suggested to consider a neutron separation

the well (∼ 50 Mev).

Those results cannot be used directly, because of the same reasons as those for other geochemical data. Partic-
ularly, the timing was based on the abundance of strong absorbers of thermal neutrons and any inﬂuence of the
variation of the constants on utilized cross sections was not investigated. Variation of the ﬁne structure constant
was analyzed only with respect to the static Coulomb interaction energy of the proton in the nucleus. However,
we have to expect that a small part of the proton and neutron masses is a result of electromagnetic interactions
and hence any variations of α lead to a shift in these masses and of the kinetic energy. Indeed only a small part
of the kinetic energy is of this electromagnetic origin. However the entire kinetic energy is much larger than the
static Coulomb interaction and eventually both electromagnetic contributions can be compatible.

Concerning two diﬀerent recent results on the ﬁne structure constant we note that in Ref. [30] more recent
and accurate data on the samarium isotopic composition were used, while in Ref.
[29] the estimation of the
temperature was more secure. We also have to point out that it is unclear how much the neutron ﬂux during
the operation time of the reactor used in Refs.
[29, 30] is sensitive to the possible variation of the constants.
We think a proper way is to determine the ﬂux and a possible variation simultaneously.

2.1.3 Nucleosynthesis

Some estimations due to Big Bang nucleosynthesis have also been performed [31, 32] in a similar way to the
geochemical study. A possible variation of the ﬁne structure constant is not larger than (1 − 2) · 10−12 yr−1.

1Nuclear data (and particularly in Tables 1, 7 and 11) have been taken from Ref. [27], when the reference is not speciﬁed.

This cosmological estimate takes an advantage of a large time separation between the epoch of nucleosynthesis
and the present day which is about the lifetime of the universe, i. e. about 1010 yr.

2.2 Astrophysical data

2.2.1 Absorption lines in quasar spectra

An advantage of astrophysical studies is a possibility of a long term comparison. A typical astrophysical time
associated with extragalactic sources (quasars) is up to 1010 yr. Due to the long reference time the accuracy
of spectroscopic measurements need not be high. It is also possible to look for corrections (like me/mp terms
in H2 spectrum). A key point of any astrophysical study is a comparison of observed lines with a data base of
lines collected under laboratory conditions in order to determine a value of the redshift

λobs = λ0(cid:0)1 + z(cid:1)

(12)

and, hence, a time separation between the epoch of the absorption and the epoch of the observation t(z). This
depends on the choice of evolution parameters of the universe and can vary by a factor two for the same z.
When the lines are identiﬁed, one can try to interpret spectroscopic data in terms of variations of transition
frequencies. It is quite important to determine the redshift and look for the variation simultaneously. When
one does this separately it is equivalent to an assumption on the stability of particular transitions. E. g. in Ref.
[33], the authors used the redshift from the observation of some astrophysical data on the hydrogen hfs line,
and so they actually assumed within the evaluation that the α2µp/µbRy is a stable value2 and this led to some
misinterpretation.

A comparison of frequencies with diﬀerent scaling behaviours is described in Sect. 1.2. Particularly, Savedoﬀ
[35] pointed out this application for the comparison of atomic lines. Thompson ﬁrst noted that molecular spectra
could be used to examine the variation of the nuclear masses [36]. An analysis of absorption lines of molecular
hydrogen in a quasar spectrum can possibly provide a limit for the variation of the proton-to-electron mass
ratio. Such an evaluation is based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of the molecular spectrum

νmol = Ry(cid:20)ce + cv(cid:16) me

M (cid:17)1/2

+ cr(cid:16) me

M (cid:17) + . . .(cid:21) ,

(13)

where ci are dimensionless parameters of order O(1). The dominate term ce is determined by the electronic
structure, the second is due to the vibrational excitations, while the third one is associated with the rotational
levels. Comparing levels with the same electronic structure (the same a), it is possible to study two other terms
and to limit the variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio from the H2 spectrum. Value M is associated
with some nuclear mass, particularly in the case of diatomic molecules it is the reduced mass of two nuclei. It
is important for applications that the coeﬃcients ci can be found both theoretically and experimentally. The
latter is possible by studying diﬀerent isotopes, particularly the reduced mass M for H2, HD, D2 etc varies
enough to allow this (see e. g. Ref. [33]).

An examination of the molecular lines, or a comparison of the rotational and vibrational transitions with
the gross structure yields a variation of me/mp. In contrast to this a comparison of the rotational terms to the

2That was pointed out in Ref. [34].

hfs in the hydrogen atom yields a limit for the α2 gp variation. Analysis of the molecular lines was performed in
Ref. [37, 38], while in Refs. [39, 40, 33, 41, 34] the authors preferred to compare the rotational and vibrational
transitions with the hfs of the hydrogen atom. The most accurate results are collected in Table 3.

A comparison of the gross structure to the ﬁne structure of some ions presented in Refs. [42, 43, 44, 45, 46,
40, 33, 47, 38, 48, 49] gave limitations on the variations of α2. Variations of the same value can be found after
studying the relativistic corrections. The most recent results were obtained in [50], where an evaluation of data
for some of Fe+ and Mg+ lines was performed. The variation of the ﬁne structure constant was obtained from
a study of relativistic corrections, calculations for which were presented separately in Ref. [51, 52].

The hfs of atomic hydrogen was examined with respect to the gross structure in Refs.

[43, 40] and with
respect to the ﬁne structure in Refs.
[43, 33]. The former of those examinations is for possible variations of
α2 (µp/µb), while the latter is for µp/µb. The strongest astrophysical limitations are summarized in Table 3,
where we give variations for actually measured values. References to previous, less precise results can be found
in quoted articles and in Ref. [44].

2.2.2 Background radiation

An analysis of microwave background radiation data to be obtained in the near future is expected to give a
limitation for a variation of the ﬁne structure constant of 10−12 − 10−13 yr −1 [53, 54].

3 Laboratory search

The limitations from Eq.(10) and Table 3 are stronger than possible in any laboratory experiments. However,
to our mind, the most reliable limitations can be achieved only under laboratory conditions and there are a few
very diﬀerent ways to determine limits for possible variations of the fundamental constants.

3.1 Laboratory nuclear data

As has been mentioned, Shlyakhter noted that the laboratory study of some nuclear properties can give reason-
able limitations for variations of the constants [24]. He considered some very low-lying resonances, the energies
of which are extremely small diﬀerences of large quantities and those must be sensitive to small variations of
parameters. The positions of some of these resonances had been known with enough accuracy for about 10
years and an estimate

was obtained [24]. The diﬀerence between this approach and others was that the most sensitive values were
studied, whereas others investigated easily available data from geochemistry. Such a test is free of the timing
problem, although, Schlyakhter’s analysis has been performed under the assumption of particle masses stability.
Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge this idea has not been developed further. Actually the estimations
[24] from laboratory data were competitive with ordinary geochemical data examined that time. However, that
is not ture in the case of the Oklo reactor.

We think that it is necessary to examine the data base of low-lying resonances. Even, if there is no progress
in measurement, the limitation in Eq.(14) is reduced by a factor of about 3.5. That is a result of adjustment of
analysis by Shlyakhter, who claimed in 1976, that the positions of the resonances had not been shifted for 10
years.

3.2 Clock comparison

Another example for a laboratory search would be a comparison of diﬀerent clocks looking for any variation
during a relatively short time (≤ 1 year) [55, 57]. Ref. [55] presented a one-year comparison of hyperﬁne structure
of Cs to the ﬁne structure of 24Mg. Another limit on a possible variation of the ratio of the frequencies from
the same authors [56] is 2.6 · 10−13 yr−1, though, the data seems to be the same. They neglected relativistic
corrections in their evaluation and gave some interpretation based on that.
Another recent comparison of the Hg+ clock (based on the hfs transition) and hydrogen clock for 140
days [57] led to a limit of 1.7 · 10−14 yr−1. The original result was presented in terms of the ﬁne structure
constant which was derived from relativistic corrections to the nonrelativistic formula. The authors of Ref. [57]
underlined the importance of relativistic eﬀects. We would like to point out that the treatment of the Cs hfs
in Ref.
[55] is just the opposite: while here the relativistic corrections were neglected [55], the others believe
that the corrections are crucially important [57]. The results from diﬀerent clock comparisons are collected in
Table 4. We give here the limits for possible variations of the ratio of the frequencies and dismiss any original
interpretations. We include also an H–Cs comparison for 1 year at the PTB [60] with a result 5.5 · 10−14 yr−1
and at U. S. Navy Observatory [61], as has been interpreted in Ref.
[57]. We would also like to mention a
result of Ref.
[62] because the clock was quite diﬀerent from others. A 12-days comparison of a Cs clock to
a new standard based on and SCSO (superconductivity-cavity stabilized oscillator [63]) was performed. The
frequency of the standard depends on its size, which is taken as proportional to the Bohr radius. This is correct
in a nonrelativistic approximation, and it is not quite clear how to estimate the relativistic corrections.

Ref.

[57] in the most important one in the table, because the hydrogen-to-cesium comparisons are taken
from there and because of discussions on the relativistic eﬀects. We discuss the interpretation of the hyperﬁne
separation in Sect. 5, but here we comment on some statements of Ref. [57].

• The correcting function for the relativistic eﬀects Frel(Zα) used there was not quite correct. The authors
did not give enough explanations and to brieﬂy discuss their evaluation we would like to mention a few
points:

- The relativistic correcting function Frel(Zα) was given with some analytic expression, while the non-
relativistic term was possible to ﬁnd only within an empirical formulae. Indeed, that is inconsistent.
The function was expected to be valid for any alkali atoms including hydrogen-like and Li-like atoms.
The result for Frel(Zα) is n-independent and it was claimed to be valid for S1/2 levels, while rather
it should be n-dependent (see e. g. Ref.
[57] is in dis-
agreement with both 1s and 2s results for a hydrogen-like atom with a nuclear charge Z [58]. In the
case of low-Z the results for a hydrogen-like atom are

[58]). Particularly, the result used in Ref.

has been performed under the condition that the relativistic corrections can appear only when the
electron is close to the nucleus and hence they are proportional to a squared value of the wave function
at the origin [59]. That is correct for heavy (Z ≫ 1) and slightly charged (z ≪ Z, where z is an
eﬀective charge for a valence electron) alkali atoms. Indeed that is incorrect for hydrogen. Actually,
the corrections for hydrogen are small, and it is enough to reproduce a correct order of magnitude.

- Recalculation in Ref.

[52] gave results for ∂ ln(Frel(Zα))/∂α, which are diﬀerent from the Casimir

calculation

∂ ln(cid:16)Frel(Zα)(cid:17)

∂ ln α

=

(Zα)2(cid:16)11 − 12(Zα)2(cid:17)
(cid:16)1 − (Zα)2(cid:17)(cid:16)3 − 4(Zα)2(cid:17)

within about 10%. The results are 2.30 for Hg+ and 0.83 for Cs [52] instead of 2.2 and 0.74 [57]. Actu-
ally the mercury ion is not an alkali one, but since all subshells are closed the Casimir approximation
has to work and that has been conﬁrmed by the many-body calculation [52].

• The authors assumed that there are no corrections to the nuclear g-factor which depend on the strong
coupling constant. Actually that means that the magnetic moment of any nucleus is to be understood
in terms of a pure kinematic description (spin and orbital contributions) with high accuracy. That is
deﬁnitely not the case (see Sect. 5 for detail). The corrections do not grow with increase of the nuclear
charge Z, but nevertheless they are large enough for a number of values of Z in a broad range. Particularly,
for tritium (Z = 1) such eﬀects shift a value of the nuclear magnetic moment by 7% (cf. Eq.(18) with
Z = 26). Even in the case of a pure kinematic model, it is incorrect to neglect variations of gp and gn,
which contribute diﬀerently to magnetic moments of hydrogen, rubidium, cesium and mercury (see Sect.
5 for detail).

• The hydrogen maser was tried intensively as a candidate for the primary frequency standard about 30
years ago. A crucial problem was low long-time stability and it has not been improved up-to-now. That
means that the maser frequency can disagree with the transition frequency and varies with the time
because of diﬀerent eﬀects, particularly, a wall-shift. Comparison of anything with the hydrogen maser
itself makes no sense. Actually, the authors of Refs. [60, 61] make no statement on a possible variation of
any transition frequency, and the interpretation in Table 4 is from Ref. [57].

10

The best limits for the annual variations of the constants from the clock (see Table 4) are on the level of a
few units in 1014 but it is not quite clear if any direct interpretation of such a comparison is actually possible.
A clock is a device designed to maintain some frequency in the most stable way. An equality of the maintained
frequency to any atomic transition frequency is not necessary, and, actually, it is not quite clear, if any clock
frequency agrees with the transition one within an accuracy on the level of its reproducibility. We expect that,
if it were to agree it would be no problem to have better limitations by just searching for a longer time.

In particular, we expect that variations of a frequency of any maser standards should also be determined by
the cavity size (cf. SCSO standard [62]). The frequency of the hydrogen hfs transition is not itself important
in some sense for the hydrogen maser. When the hfs frequency and the size of the resonator are inconsistent
the standard cannot work, and when they are consistent (within the line width) everything is determined by
the cavity. That is indeed a reason why there are a lot of possibilities of drifts for the frequency from the maser
standard. Such a maser, without any tuning of the cavity size is called a passive maser . On the other hand in
the case of active maser there is an adjustment of the cavity size to the hydrogen hfs studying the eﬃciency of
the maser. In this case the dependence on the variation of the constants is more complicated.

It is known that hydrogen masers can have high short-time stability. But there is no a priori statement
applicable to any particular hydrogen maser, after a rather preliminary study of these. The study assumes some
comparisons with either another known standard, or a wide representative ensemble of masers. In both cases,
any later comparison with that maser assumes that is consistent with some other standard and that the stability
property (e. g. short-term stability) does not vary with time. This is an indirect comparison with something
else via the maser. In the case of a 140 day comparison the maser stability and agreement between the maser
frequency and the hydrogen hfs are questionable and the stability may only be a result of preliminary study of
the maser frequency with respect to some other standard.

We think that the clock comparison can give reliable limits only in two cases:

• The clock frequency is expressed in terms of the transition frequency. But that means, that with the clock
comparison one can measure the transition frequency as well. We consider some of possibility for search
with the precise frequency measurements below (see Sect. 3.3).

• There are a number of diﬀerent standards with the same transition (like in the case of Cs). They should
ﬁrst be compared with each others and then we can estimate possible deviations from some eﬀective
frequency that depends on the transition rather than on the clock. This is not as secure as a direct
determination of the transition frequency, but it is more or less reliable.

In the case where some particular transition is applied in only a single clock, it is absolutely unclear, which
drifts or ﬂuctuations are properties of the clock and which are properties of the transition.

3.3 Precise frequency measurements

Precision spectroscopy provides us with other ways to search for the variation of the fundamental constants.
The most straightforward method is to obtain a high accuracy and to compare two results (let us say, one
taken a year after the other).
It is also possible to make a comparison of results obtained now with some
relatively old ones for the frequency of atomic or molecular transitions measured better than 10−11. Tables of
the most accurately measured values of any transition frequencies are presented below. Table 5 contains the
best radiofrequency results, while Table 6 is for the optical transitions. The tables contain the results obtained
from 1967 to the present with a fractional uncertainty below 10−11. One can see that some older results are
competitive with the newer ones. In the tables we give a possible limit of variation of the frequency if the new
experimental value is to be obtained in the year 2000 and with some higher accuracy. If the precision is about
the same, one should also take into consideration an uncertainty in the newer measurement. So, the ﬁnal limit
has to be larger than that given in the tables by a factor between √2 (if the uncertainties are independent) and
2 (when they are strongly correlated). In our evaluation we consider the date of publication as the date of the
measurement, whereas they are slightly diﬀerent and some shifts may arise from this.

The hydrogen hfs is presented in Table 5 with a value from review [64]. We discuss the original results in
Sect. 6.2. The tables mainly indicates some opportunities for experiments in the near future. Except for the
hydrogen hfs only one value in Table 5 has been accurately and independently measured twice (namely, the hfs
intervals in the 171Yb+ atom). A comparison of two 171Yb+ measurements ([70] and [71]) gives the variation
of the frequencies

Table 5: The most precise measurements of the ground state hyperﬁne structure interval and a possible level of
limit for the variation of their frequencies. Values for ∂ ln ν/∂t have been calculated under the condition that
the frequency will be re-measured in the year 2000 with a better accuracy. The variation of the frequencies is
assumed with respect to the cesium hfs.

if we suppose that the time separation is 4 years.

It is important to note, that even a single laboratory study can give a relatively secure result. In some
experiments several traps were used and so they contain an independent measurement in part. Since most of
the recent precision investigations have the building of a new standard as a target, some long-term monitoring
of the measured frequency was often performed. Unfortunately, the published data are rather incomplete, but
we expect that some limits on a level between 10−12 and 10−13 yr−1 will be available after complete publications
of studies giving most of the recent results in Tables 5 and 6.

The most precise comparison with one of the results that is already known for some time can be performed
for the hydrogen ground state hyperﬁne structure interval. The possibility to reach a good result has almost
been missed. However, in the case of new experiments, like for rubidium or mercury, it may easily be a shift
of 1–2 sigma afterwards. On the other hand, some new results are going to be presented soon: for the Rb hfs
(better than 10−14) and for the 1s − 2s transition in hydrogen (a few units in 1014). That means that in the
case of any delay the measurement could be not compatible.
It is also important to underline that so-called variation-of-constants experiments check diﬀerent possibilities
associated with drifts of primary and secondary standards. A one-year comparison, which can usually be realized
in a laboratory, is not the same as a kind of “world wide” comparison over years. The hydrogen hfs interval is a
value which can be measured in a number of diﬀerent laboratories now and which was in the past also studied
in a few diﬀerent places.

Two radio-frequency measurements (namely for tritium and barium) were performed for unstable isotopes
(T1/2(T) = 12.3 yr and T1/2(Ba) = 10.5 yr) and this indicates that the search for appropriate transitions should
not be limited to stable isotopes only. We do not mention the radioactivity of rubidium-87 which has a halftime
of 4.8 · 1010 yr, comparable with the age of the universe.
magnetic ﬁeld. A splitting between (MI = −3/2, MJ = +1/2) and (−1/2, +1/2) was determined [81]

We also have to mention an experiment with the ground state hyperﬁne structure of 9Be+ in a strong

ν = 303 016.377 265 070(57) kHz .

(21)

The measurement was performed at a ﬁeld of about 0.8194 T and the splitting was found at its magnetic-ﬁeld-
independent point. The fractional uncertainty is 1.9 · 10−13 and it was believed [82] that this may be reduced
to about 1 · 10−13. A further measurement of the splitting in the year 2000 is to give a limit of the variation of
the Be-frequency with respect to the cesium standard on level of 1.3 · 10−14.

4 Some new options for precise comparison of frequencies

4.1 Hyperﬁne structure

For a while the hyperﬁne splitting of atomic levels has been a quantity available for the most precise measure-
ments. Comparison of hfs in diﬀerent atoms can give us precise information on the variation of the nuclear
magnetic moment rather than on the ﬁne structure constant.

• We start with the hydrogen hfs project. The hyperﬁne structure interval in the ground state of the
hydrogen atom was frequently measured (see Sects. 6.1 and 6.2). For a preliminary estimation we accept
a value

νhfs(H) = 1420 405.751 766 7(9) kHz ,

(22)

which used to be presented in reviews (see e. g. Ref.
[64]) as a ﬁnal result for the hfs separation. The
fractional uncertainty is about 6 parts in 1014 and on being divided by 30 years that gives 2 · 10−14 yr−1.
If the accuracy is now the same this should rather be multiplied by √2.

• Let us consider brieﬂy a possible variation of the deuterium hyperﬁne separation, which was measured in
1972 [65] with an uncertainty of 5.2 · 10−12. The relative accuracy is much worse than for H (cf. Eq.(22)).
However, the magnetic moment of a deutron (see Table 11) includes a large cancellation

µ(D) ≃ µp + µn = |µp| − |µn|

(23)

between the proton (µp = 2.793 µn) and neutron (µn = −1.913 µn) contributions and this hfs value might
be very sensitive to the variation of eﬀective parameters of the strong interactions.

• The hfs of the ground state in the 171Yb+ ion can also provide a limit for the variation per year on a level
of a few units in 1014. The most precise measurements are presented in Fig. 2, where the open circles are
for preliminary results [83, 84], while the full ones are for ﬁnal values [70, 71].

The disadvantages (in comparison to the hydrogen case) are: a less strong limit for the variation with less
reliability (the result was reached with a high accuracy in two laboratories, but the precision was diﬀerent
by a factor 3).

• Generally, study of nuclei with small magnetic moments are expected to lead to sensitive tests for possible
variations of the proton or neutron magnetic moment. We give a list of stable nuclei with small magnetic
moments in Table 7. The tungsten 183
Up to now, there is no way to measure the nuclear magnetic moment with an accuracy on the level 1011 or
better. For nuclei with spin 1/2, our proposal is to measure the hfs of a neutral atom or ion and to search
for a variation of that value. In the case of spin 3/2, a value of the hfs interval is essentially aﬀected by
the nuclear quadrupole moment. An exception is 41K, where the quadrupole term is also small and it is
worthwhile studying the hfs. Fortunately, the stable nuclei with the smallest magnetic moments (namely,
57Fe, 103Rh and 187Os) have spin 1/2 and we hope that the accurate study of the hfs of the nuclei with a
small magnetic moment is possible.

moment of the nucleus, investigating ions with coupled electrons only (Hg-, Os-, W-, Hf-, Ba-, Xe-like etc).
Particularly, Hg-, Ba- and Xe-like ions have complete subshells and this is an advantage for the study of
198Tl. We hope that a method developed in Ref. [85] to study a bound electron g-factor in H-like ions can
be applied here. By achieving an uncertainty of about 10−9 for the magnetic moment, the limit for the
variation of gp is expected to be on the level of 3 · 10−13 yr−1. We should mention that not all magnetic
moments of radionuclides with a halftime longer than 10 days are known [27] and it might happen, that
some of them are even smaller than 10−3 µn.

4.2 Fine structure

When the ﬁne structure (proportional to α2Ry) is determined, it can be compared with the gross structure
(proportional to Ry) and thus yielding a direct limit for a variation of the ﬁne structure constant α. The gross
structure can be taken from measurements with neutral hydrogen and calcium atoms, and with strontium and
indium ions and, maybe, in the future with other atoms.

• To date there are no competitive results on the fs. The best result for the atomic ﬁne structure has been

(24)

Note that this is for the fs of excited states. We think that some higher accuracy can be achieved by
studying the ﬁne structure associated with the ground state. If the subshell with valence p-electrons (or
d) is open, the lowest excited states are due to the ﬁne structure. The frequency can lie in radio-frequency
range and the lines are very narrow. That is because of two reason: the E1 transition is not allowed for
P − P transitions and the decay rate is proportional to some power of the low transition frequency. Thus
the lowest levels are split due to relativistic eﬀects only and they can be measured accurately. This is
another way of measuring the ﬁne structure precisely. In combination with the gross structure, one can
reach a limit for α. The interpretation of such a comparison is simpler than in the case of hfs. A similar
way is to study the relativistic correction for the gross structure is of use for astrophysical data [35]. In
Table 84 we give a list of the rf transition of the low-lying ﬁne structure in some neutral atoms, while
those for diﬀerent ions are collected in Table 9.

Unfortunately, there are no systems in the tables which can be easily studied. In the case of neutral atoms
in Table 8, laser cooling is hard to apply because of the metastable ﬁne structure levels. Finding levels
which are insensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld is a problem for ions. These are (23P0) in N+ and (3d4 − 5D0)
in V+. Finding proper means of detection of the fs transition can be another problem for a few-ions trap
experiments.

• It is also possible to ﬁnd an optical or infrared transition for the low-lying ﬁne structure. Let us mention
(25)

a transition

νfs(Pb, 63P0 − 63P2) ≃ 1.32 eV

in neutral lead, which can be studied by means of two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy (the wave length
of each photon is 1.88 µm). The excited level 3P2 lives for 2.6 s and it is narrow enough to reach an
accurate result. It has to be mentioned that in the case of neutral lead, calculations using jj coupling
are competitive with those using LS one. Actually, a clear separation of non-relativistic and relativistic
physics is only possible for LS coupling. LS coupling means that one must ﬁrst ﬁnd a non-relativistic
energy level with n∗(L) and next to take into account the (relativistic) spin eﬀects. For jj coupling the
(relativistic) spin eﬀects for individual electrons are more important than a (non-relativistic) interaction
of their orbital momenta. We expect large relativistic corrections to the ﬁne structure.
One possible experiment is presented in Fig. 3. The ground state (6p2 3P0) of one of the spinless isotopes of
lead (204Pb, natural abundance 1.4%; 206Pb, 24%; or 208Pb, 52%) is excited by two photons (λ = 1.878 µm)

3In Refs. [55, 56] a clock, based on ﬁne structure in Mg, was compared with a cesium clock. However, the authors gave no result
of the fs transition frequency. As I was informed by A. Godone it was expected that the corrections to the fs were well understood
at least on level of 10−12.

4Atomic data (and particularly that in Tables 8, 9 and 10) have been taken from Ref. [80], unless otherwise speciﬁed.

to a metastable 3P2 level with a lifetime of 2.6 s. The line is narrow because of the metastability and of
Doppler-free excitation. Detection of the 3P2 level can be done using an additional one-photon excitation
(λ = 0.283 µm) to a 6p7s3P0 state and measuring the ﬂuorenscence (λ = 0.406 µm).

• Alkali atoms have simple spectra and that is an advantage for both experiment [55, 76, 78, 86, 88] and
theory [59, 52]. Measurement of the ﬁne structure of such a system as a test for the variations of α was
proposed by Jungmann [87] (cf. Ref. [35]) particularly for Ca+ and Sr+ ions. Similar measurement can be
performed for In+. All these atoms are now a subject of some investigations as a part of eﬀorts to design
new optical standards. Let us discuss shortly the indium case. An accurate result for the ﬁne structure
may be obtained by considering the 5s5p − 3PJ levels in the 115In+ ion. The fs interval of excited levels
cannot usually be measured precisely. For an indium ion it may however be determined as the diﬀerence
between two gross transitions (5s2−1S0 − 5s5p−3PJ )ith diﬀerent J. Indeed, since the fs interval is about
1% of the transition frequency for the gross structure, one can expect that the fractional accuracy is not
very high. The advantage is that in the case of very accurate measurements of 5s2− 1S0 − 5s5p− 3P0
for diﬀerent PJ -states, it may be possible to go beyond the accuracy of standards. As an example, let
us recall the results on the 1s − 2s transition in the hydrogen atom [74] and on the hydrogen-deuterium
isotopic shift of the 1s − 2s frequency [90]. By comparing the two frequencies, it was possible to detect a
drift of the standard used and to reduce the absolute uncertainty to 150 Hz for the isotopic shift, while
for hydrogen this was 850 Hz. The absolute measurement in the indium ion (5S − 5P0 transition) now
gives [88] 1 267 402 452 914(41) kHz (uncertainty is 3.2 · 10−11) and the result is soon to be improved.

• Another approach to compare the gross and ﬁne structure may possibly be realized in an atomic system,
where the levels with diﬀerent n and l lie close each to other. This may be in the case of an accidental
cancellation of the Ry and α2Ry terms. An example of such a cancellation can be seen in the spectrum
of the Ag atom. Two excited multiplets, 4d105p and 4d95s2 (one of the 4d95s2 lines is quite narrow ∼ 1
Hz), are split slightly. The splitting comes from the gross structure. However, it is comparable with the

internal structure of the multiplets, which is due to the relativistic corrections (ﬁne structure). For such
a cancellation, a value of energy splitting between levels from diﬀerent multiplets is quite sensitive to a
variation of α. Measuring the splitting with relatively low accuracy, it is possible to reach a strong limit.
A similar idea for the 4f 105d6s − 4f 95d26s lines in the Dy atom was proposed in Ref. [51, 52]. In some
sense, the search for the accidental degeneration is quite close to approaches using nuclear data, in which
the smallness of some diﬀerences is widely utilized (see e. g. Ref. [24]).

Let us discuss conditions needed for success in such an experiment. We consider the spectrum of the Ag
atom as an example and some properties of low-lying levels in that atom are presented in Fig. 4 and Table
10.

The conditions for a precise measurement of a transition sensitive to possible variations of the constants
are:

– The ﬁne structure terms should be of the same order of magnitude as the gross structure contributions.
J levels is about the same value as the
3/2) and one of the 4d95s22DJ levels (4d95s22D5/2). The other

In the silver ion this is true: the splitting of the two 5p2P 0
separation between one of them (5p2P 0
ﬁne structure splitting (between D levels) is larger than the P − D interval.

– The non-relativistic (Ry) and relativistic terms α2Ry have to have a diﬀerent sign. This is very
likely because of the sandwich sequence of levels P − D − P − D with the center of gravity of the
D level lying above that for the P states. That means that the non-relativistic contribution for the
D states is likely higher than for the P states. As far as we are interested in the lower D level, we

can expect that the relativistic contribution to that is negative. Indeed, if silver qualiﬁed for other
conditions it would be studied theoretically before performing the experiment. The relativistic eﬀects
shift and split levels. We can estimate an enhancement of the sensitivity assuming that there are no
shifts, but only splittings. We expect this should work for a preliminary estimation. In such a case
a non-relativistic correction can be found from the separation of the centers of gravitation of the P
and D lines:

∆NR(2P 0

1/2 − 2D5/2) = −55.89 THz = A Ry ,

Figure 4: Scheme of low-lying levels of the neutral Ag atom. The hyperﬁne structure is not shown.

– For accurate measurement it may be important to use laser cooling. An important conditions for
this is lack of the hyperﬁne structure. Unfortunately both stable isotopes (107Ag and 109Ag) have
some magnetic moment and the ground state of any stable isotope is usually split into two states.
The laser cooling is possible but rather complicated.

– It may also be important to apply two-photon Doppler-free excitation to produce one of the two
levels, splitting of which contains a cancellation between relativistic and non-relativistic term. This
is necessary because it is somehow possible to cool the ground state, but not excited states. We have
to eliminate Doppler eﬀects due to excitation. The D states in the silver atom can be excited by
means of the two-photon transitions.

– Both levels have to be narrow. The D level (4d95s22D5/2) is very narrow with a width of about 1

Hz, but both P states are very broad.

– A precise measurement of the small splitting due to the cancellation must be possible. Generally this
means that one must be to induce a single-photon transition. The one-photon transition between
states 4d95s22D5/2 and 5p2P 0
3/2 lies at 7 THz. It can be induced but it is hard to measure such a
transition frequency precisely.

One can see that the conditions can be realized in some atomic systems and it is necessary to search for
them. One should note that in the case of ions the condition for choice of nuclear spin is diﬀerent. It may
be more important to have some states that are insensitive to a magnetic ﬁeld (the whole moment F of a
system of electrons plus nucleus must be integer and states with mF = 0 are alowed).
Our suggestion is to look for a relatively small enhancement but with an appropriate possibility for precise
measurements. The proposal with Dy in Refs.
[51, 52] is rather for a great enhancement without any
accurate spectroscopy.

5 Nuclear magnetic moments and interpretation of the frequency

comparisons

A frequency comparison involves atoms that are very diﬀerentin nature and one must be prepared to interpret
results. Most precise results are for the hfs (see Table 5) and we mainly discuss the hfs transitions. Since

any absolute measurements assume a comparison to the cesium hyperﬁne separation this is also important for
interpreting the absolute optical measurements (see Table 6).

5.1 Magnetic moments

To the leading order the hfs interval can be presented in the form of Eq.(2). There are two diﬀerent factors
important for the comparison: magnetic moments and the relativistic corrections. The magnetic moments
and some other nuclear properties are collected in Table 11. Some atoms, hyperﬁne separation in which was
measured accurately, but less precisely than one part in 1011, are also included:

• νhfs(43Ca+) = 15 199 862.858(2) kHz [91];
• νhfs(113Cd+) = 3 225 608.286 4(3) kHz [92];
• νhfs(131Ba+) = 9 107 913.699 0(5) kHz [69];
• νhfs(135Ba+) = 7 183 340.234 9(6) kHz [93];
• νhfs(137Ba+) = 8 037 741.667 7(4) kHz [94].

Most of these are stable, expect cadmium (T1/2(113Cd) = 9· 1015 yr) and the lightest barium (T1/2(131Ba) = 12
d). The sign of the magnetic moment of 131Ba was presented in Ref. [27] as unknown and we follow Ref. [69].
A discussion on the value of the nuclear magnetic moments is also important because of our proposal to look

for variations of small moments.

All nuclei in Table 11 and 7 have an odd value of A, while Z is even for iron, gadolinium, osmium and
tungsten (Table 7) and calcium, cadmium, barium, ytterbium and mercury (Table 11) and odd for all others.
An even value of Z indicates that the nuclear magnetic moment is associated with the neutron magnetic moment
and in the case of odd Z the moment is due to the proton one. Let us start with small moments. Some of these
can be understood using a simple model (the Schmidt model), while assuming that the magnetic moment of
the nucleus—like a moment of an electron in a hydrogen-like atom—includes a spin part and an orbital part

where I = S + L, µs

terms (µs
a) originate from dynamic eﬀects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strong coupling regime
and so they sensitive to a variation of the QCD coupling constant (αs). The Schmidt model leads to some
relatively small values in a few cases:

orbit contributions)

coeﬃcient 1/3):

µn ∼ 0.64 µn ,

(33)

where gn = −2 · 1.913 . . ..

In all other cases presented in Tables 11 and 7 the value of the magnetic moment is not smaller than one in
units of the nuclear magneton µn. In some cases the agreement between the Schmidt values and the actual ones
is a 10% level, but in other cases the actual values are signiﬁcantly smaller and that is a result of the nuclear

21

eﬀects and, hence, small magnetic moments are sensitive to these. Comparison of Eqs.(31), (32) and (33) shows
that the nuclei with odd Z and odd A can be more interesting because the magnetic moment is small partly
due to cancellations between the spin and orbit contributions, which are sensitive to variation of gp.

Table 12: Magnetic moment, spin and parity of nuclei in the Schmidt model (Eqs.(30) and (34)).

Comparison of the Schmidt model with the most important isotopes for precision measurements and vari-
ations of the constants is presented in Fig. 5. Here we collect the Schmidt values (two lines) and actual
values of the magnetic moments of the isotopes from Table 11 (ﬁlled circles), other stable or long-lived iso-
topes associated with simple atomic spectra of neutral or single-charged ions (open circles), and the isotopes
from Table 7 with small magnetic moments (triangles). One nucleus of this kind (87Sr, 9/2+, µ = −1.094µn,
µs(9/2+) = −1.931µn)) is not included in the ﬁgure because of its large spin.
From the ﬁgure one sees that the agreement between real values and the simple Schmidt model is not
perfect. This means that nature of nuclear spin are more complicated and the eﬀects of nuclear interaction are
signiﬁcant. However, the model contains some important physics: e. g. the model predicts simple relations
between the nuclear parity and magnetic moment. Only one isotope in Fig. 5 has inconsistent values of the
parity and spin (169Tm, 1/2+, µ = −0.23µn).
There is no simple model for even A, when there are two valence particles—a proton and neutron—and a
contribution of orbital motion. For deuterium the proton and neutron contributions have diﬀerent signs (23).
Two radionuclides discussed in Sect. 4.1, 198

79 Au, have even A.

5.2 Relativistic corrections

Now let us discuss the hfs intervals in Table 5. First, we consider the relativistic corrections, which have been in
part discussed in Sect 3.2. They can be calculated within using many-body perturbation theory (see e. g. Ref.
[52]). An approximation of Eqs.(18) and (19) is a good one for alkali atoms (all but ytterbium and mercury in
Table 5) under the conditions:

• High nuclear charge: Z ≫ 1.
• Atoms are neutral or slightly charged: Z ≫ z, where z is an eﬀective charge of a compound nucleus for
the valentce electron, i. e. z = 1 for neutral atoms and z = 2 for single-charged ones. Note that, Eq.(18)
is incorrect for hydrogen and its isotopes and for the Li-like ion of beryllium presented in Table 5.

• Accuracy is expected to be on a 5−15% level and a comparison of two atoms with a small charge diﬀerence

(Z1,2 ≫ |Z1 − Z2|) will not give accurate results.

As already mentioned, due to a discussion on the interpretation of results in Ref. [57], any atom with a closed
subshell and one valence electron satisﬁes the above conditions. Alkali atoms actually form only one example
of such atomic systems.

Relativistic corrections are also important for the gross and ﬁne structure. They have a relative order of
(Zα)2. In the simplest case, namely for alkali atoms, they were discussed in Ref. [52], where some results were
obtained for Ca and Sr+ and in Ref.
[95] for In+. It seems that relativistic eﬀects are less important for the
optical transitions than for the hfs because of relatively small numerical coeﬃcients and an extra 1/n∗ factor.

In the hydrogen atom for both hfs and 1s − 2s transitions the corrections are negligible.

5.3 Hyperﬁne structure

The hfs of atoms with nuclei with even Z and odd A is sensitive to the neutron magnetic moment. In particular
the Schmidt model predicts the magnetic moment of mercury and ytterbium–171 (see Eq.(33)) within 15%
uncertainty. In contrast the hfs of atoms with odd Z and odd A depends on a value of the proton magnetic
moment. An important point however is the size of nuclear eﬀects of the strong and electromagnetic interactions.
They can be estimated by a deviation from the Schmidt value. In the case of Cs the nuclear eﬀects increase the
value by a factor of about 1.5. This means that any interpretation of comparisons with Cs cannot neglect the
strong interactions.

In the case of even-to-even or odd-to-odd comparisons, in particular for H–Rb, and Be–Yb–Hg, we expect
an information on the variation of the constants due to the nuclear eﬀects and the relativistic corrections.
Comparison of odd-to-even hfs yields to variation of gn with respect to gp. This is important, because there
is no reason to expect that a value of gn/gp is relatively stable, while the constants are varying. Our point of

23

view is diﬀerent from that in Ref. [57], where the H–Hg+ comparison was examined assuming that a variation
of the nuclear g-factors can be neglected.

We have not mentioned the Cs hfs because here the interpretation is slightly diﬀerent. Although 133Cs is an
isotope with odd Z, its comparison with H or Rb is sensitive to a variation of gp, because the gp contribution
to the nuclear g factor has a negative sign in contrast to H and Rb. For example, the sensitivity of the H-to-Cs
comparison to the gp variation is determined by the value of

Table 13: Hyperﬁne structure properties. Relativistic corrections, if not speciﬁed, are calculated from Eqs.(18)
and (19). We estimate the uncertainty for F as 5% and for the derivative as 10% by comparison with Ref. [52].
In the case of hydrogen and beryllium, the Casimir correction is not appropriate, but Eqs.(15), (16) and (17)
lead to negligible shifts.

We summarize some properties of hfs intervals of some atoms in Table 13. The naive value (µs) is the
Schmidt one ((see Table 12) for any atom, except deuterium. The deuterium naive value is determined from
Eq.(23). It is not quite clear if the Schmidt model works, but we expect it to be appropriate for preliminary
estimations and we consider deviations from the naive value µ/µs− 1 as a correction due to nuclear interactions.
For Cs, the corrections shift the value by 50% and unsurprisingly that is the largest contribution in Table 13.
Cesium has only one stable isotope and this indicates that the nuclear conﬁguration is not strongly bounded
and so diﬀerent nuclear core polarization eﬀects or an admixture of excited states can be signiﬁcant. We have
included the beryllium ion in the Table mainly due to the measurement [81] in the magnetic ﬁeld.
In the
leading non-relativistic approximation this value is proportional to the hfs interval at zero ﬁeld. The relativistic
corrections are diﬀerent, but they are small enough.

Relativistic corrections are calculated using Casimir approach of Eqs.(18) and (19), except for derivatives
for Cs and Hg, taken from Ref.
[52]. One reason, why derivatives are relatively large is that the function F
is always a function of α2. However, one can expect the same for the strong interactions. One can see that

24

the relativistic corrections for alkali atoms are of the same sign and it must be a partial cancellation for the
comparison of two diﬀerent hfs. In contrast, the nuclear eﬀects shift a value of the nuclear magnetic moment
in diﬀerent directions for diﬀerent atoms and an enhancement (e. g. for the Rb–Cs hfs) is possible. We can
however hope that for a representative enough set of atoms they can be considered rather as statistical errors.
Clearly if we would like to have a clear interpretation of some frequency comparisons, we have to choose one

of two options:

• We can measure only the gross and ﬁne structure with understandable relativistic eﬀects and reach a limit

for the variation of α.

• We can involve the hfs in the comparison. In this case we must be able to estimate nuclear eﬀects and their
variations. The magnetic moment can be close to the Schmidt value accidently due to some cancellation
of contributions with diﬀerent nature and it can be quite sensitive to the variations of the constants. So it
is necessary to have small and understandable corrections due to the nuclear eﬀects. It is also necessary to
do a few comparisons in order to be able to transform variations of the frequencies to variations of α, gp,
gn and µn/µb. One should emphasize a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the study of atoms with odd A and
either odd or even Z. The even Z nuclear magnetic moments are mainly proportional to the same value
(gn), which can be corrected by nuclear eﬀects. A comparison between two even Z hfs is insensitive to
any variations gn. Conversely investigation of only odd Z atoms should provide enough information on gp
because they contain spin and orbit contributions which diferently depend on nuclear quantum numbers
(L, S and J).

In principle, there is one more option search available. One can look for two isotopes (with odd Z and odd
A, but diﬀerent nuclear spins or parity) of one element with magnetic moments close to their Schmidt values.
The ratio of the hfs intervals should be free oﬀ any relativistic and many-body atomic corrections and could be
not too sensitive to nuclear eﬀects. In this case the ratio of the hfs should be close to a ratio of their respective
Schmidt values, i. e. a simple function of gp. Unfortunately we have been not able to ﬁnd an appropriate pair
of the isotopes for this study.

5.4 Time structure of the measurements

We should point out a timing problem in the absolute frequency measurements. Some results have been obtained
via a direct comparison to the primary cesium clock, i. e. directly compared to the Cs hfs. Others have been
compared indirectly and the “time structure” of such an experiment can be quite complicated and includes some
intermediate steps with comparisons between diﬀerent secondary standards. An example is a measurement of
the 2s− 8s and 2s− 8d transitions in hydrogen and deuterium atoms by the Paris group. The measurements [96]
involved a comparison in 1997 of the hydrogen and deuterium lines with some secondary standard, gauged in
1985 [97]. The standard was recalibrated in 1999 [98]. Such a time structure is reasonable for a determination
of the Rydberg constant and the hydrogen Lamb shift, but it is not appropriate to search for a variation of
the constants. In Tables 5 and 6 we assume that publication time is the time for a direct comparison with a
primary Cs standard. For the hydrogen and deuterium hyperﬁne structure that is approximately correct. In
some cases that is not so.

The other time structure problem is in a comparison with secondary standards, like a hydrogen maser.
Some preliminary studies estimated possible deviations of its frequency with respect to some known standards
or with respect to some average value of an ensemble of masers. In both case it is not clear how to interpret
any comparison with a speciﬁc maser at some particular time.

6 The hyperﬁne separation in the hydrogen atom

6.1 Historical remarks

The hydrogen hfs was studied for a few generations of experiments. The ﬁrst results with an accuracy of
about 1012 were reached about 35 years ago and some of them are presented in Table 14. Most experiments
[99, 100, 101, 102] were devoted to a measurement of the maser frequency, while previously measured value for
the wall-shift using another maser in Ref. [112] was accepted. In Ref. [101] no explicit value of uncertainty was
claimed. From discussions in that paper we estimate it as 3· 10−12 for the NRC cesium standard and 1.7· 10−12
for the maser.

One of the ﬁrst really accurate experiments was performed by NBS [104] and in part by Harvard University
team [105].
It was pointed out [104] that the wall-shift and the frequency have to be determined in the
experiments for the same masers. This generation of experiments [106, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112]
is discussed in the next section. When we speak about two generations we refer to an ideology, rather than to
a time-frame. Some other experiments [115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120] performed in that time or slightly earlier
[115] wherein an experiment that measured both the
were not so precise (see Fig. 6). Let us mention Ref.
frequency and the wall-shift was described. However, only two bulbs were used. As was noted in Ref.
[104]
another important condition for appropriate results is the use of a large number of bulbs of diﬀerent size (e. g.
in Ref. [104] 11 bulbs were and in Ref. [105] the number was 18).

6.2 Thirty years ago

About thirty years ago a number of precise results for the hfs interval in the ground state of the hydrogen atom
were published [106, 104, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114]. That was due to a trial to use the hydrogen
maser as a primary frequency standard. The results are collected in Table 15. Until the publication of results
Eq.(21) of experiment on the hfs of the beryllium ion ﬁfteen years ago [81], the value of the hyperﬁne separation
in the hydrogen atom had been the most precisely measured physical quantity.

[105]. Result #5 of Ref.

The experiments were performed using hydrogen masers and two key values were measured simultaneously:
the frequency of the maser and the wall-shift. Result #9 is an exception: the authors utilized a value of the
wall-shift from Ref.
[107] with the smallest uncertainty was actually a preliminary
presentation. The ﬁnal value of the NPL experiment (result #5) had an accuracy [109] three times lower.
One of the papers contains a report on two independent measurements [104], quoted as experiment 1 and
experiment 2, and we give both results in the table, as well as an average value presented by the authors of
Ref.
[104]. Experiment 2 is a pure NBS experiment. In experiment 1 the maser frequency of a maser from
Harvard university was measured with respect to the NBS primary cesium standard [104], while the wall-shift
of the same maser was measured by the Harvard people [105]. The same result for the wall-shift [105] was
[111] for another maser, the frequency of which they measured. Values #11
accepted by the authors of Ref.
and #12 were presented in Ref.
[113]. That paper is devoted to a measurement of the wall-shift and the
unperturbed maser frequency (result #11) at the Shanghai Bureau of Metrology. It also contains a reference
to an unpublished result (#12) for the unperturbed hydrogen frequency of two hydrogen maser by the Shaanxi
Asrtonomical Observatory. In this two bulbs from the SBM were used. The last result in Table (# 13) is based
on a diﬀerent idea. Authors studied the temperature dependence of the wall-shift and they found the the shift

27

vanished at some temperature T0. The hfs interval was afterwards determined from a maser frequency at T0.

The value in Table 5 (Eq.(22)) calculated by Ramsey [64] is an average of results #4 and #5, and so cannot
be actually accepted. However, the results in Table 15 are consistent (apart from the earliest one) and one can
calculate some average values. For instance the average values can be calculated over results ##1–3, 6–13 (a
wide set) or over ##4, 6, 7, 10 and 11 (a conservative set). The wide set includes all original results, while
the conservative one contains only values published in refereed journals. We consider results #1 and #7 as
preliminary and also exclude result #8 because the wall-shift and the frequency werenot measured during the
same experiment.

As a preliminary estimation, one can assume that the uncertainties are independent and one ﬁnds:

νwide = 1 420 405.751 770 4(6) kHz

(38)

and

(39)
The fractional uncertainty of the average value is (4–9)·10−13 and that is approximately as in Table 5. In fact
there has to be some correlation between the systematic errors. However since most of the results are consistent,
any averaging cannot yield a value that is less precise than one of the results, namely

νcons = 1 420 405.751 768 3(12) kHz .

ν(#4) = 1420 405.751 768(2) kHz .

(40)

We think this result should be used for comparisons because it is the most accurate and reliable result in Table
15. Result #4 was published in a refereed journal [104] (in contrast to result #8 [110]) and it was based on two
independent measurements of the unperturbated hydrogen hfs frequency with respect to the NBS primary Cs
standard. The largest number of bulbs was used to determine the wall-shift using two independent experiments
[105, 104]. The result is in fair agreement with other results in Table 15, apart from results #1 and # 13. The
discrepancy with the former is not important, because result #1 does not agree with others on a one-sigma
level, but rather within three sigma. We also should mention that Ref. [108] refers to a private communication
by one of the authors of Ref. [106] (Menoud, 1971) wherein a new LSRH value of hydrogen hfs

ν(LSRH ) = 1 420 405.751 764(10) kHz ,

(41)

is quoted. This is less precise than result #1 but agrees with other results. Two results in Table 15 are more
precise than the value in Eq.(40). One of them (# 5) [107] was later corrected by the authors [109]. The other
(result # 13) was obtained using very diﬀerent methods. We do not include it in the conservative set since it is
inconsistent with most other results of this set. To conclude, we present in Fig. 7 an overview of experiments
done about 30 years ago. Most experimental results measured the wall-shift together with the frequency. Some
details on the crucial results can be found in the Appendix.

One should note that 30 years ago the accuracy of the primary cesium standards was not so high as now and
this was an important source of uncertainty. The results in Table 15 are presented together with the name of the
primary cesium standard used. We expect that it is possible to study variations of those standards which were
frequently discussed due to international comparisons. We also expect that the reference set for comparison
with experiments possible in the year 2000 will to be between the conservative and wide ones. Particularly, the
main sources of uncertainty in experiments 1 and 2 in Ref. [104] are, in part, independent.

6.3 Why it is important to do experiment with hydrogen now

The hydrogen atom can now be used in the search for a limit for the variations of fundamental constants on
a level that is comparable with most other possible projects. If the Paris group have really reached a level of
accuracy (δν/ν ≃ 2.4 · 10−15) reported [121] as a preliminary result

νhfs(87Rb) = 6 834 682.610 904 333(17) kHz ,

(42)

then only the work on the Rb clock and the Rb hfs can provide a signiﬁcantly more precise test for the variations.
Usually, it takes some time to really remove all sources of systematic errors after the ﬁrst announcement of a
performed measurement with a signiﬁcantly better accuracy. The ratio of Rb and Cs hfs may also be less
sensitive to the variations, and therefore it is not enough to compare two hfs transitions only. It is necessary to
have several diﬀerent data sets.

In any case, the study of the hydrogen hfs has a number of advantages, as are listed below:

• This is the only accurate comparison over a long interval (30 yr). Only the 171Yb+ hfs and the 9Be+ in
the magnetic ﬁeld (with a shorter time separation) is comparable to this. The other results obtained ﬁve
or more years ago cannot provide a search for a variation of the constants on a level below 10−13 yr−1.

• The result was obtained 30 years ago independently in a few diﬀerent laboratories (see Table 15) after
long studies over a number of years. Only ytterbium–171 was measured in two laboratories, whereas other
transitions from Tables 5 and 6 have been studied in only one place for each atom.

• Most of the measurements of the hydrogen hfs were performed by direct comparisons with primary Cs

clocks and thus they have simple time structures.

• Nowadays, this measurement can be also done in a number of laboratories.
• There is no direct problem due to the accuracy of any primary frequency standard because of the relatively

low accuracy needed for the measurement.

• The measurement should be as precise as possible. If a level better than 10−14 is achieved, a repetition in
a few years can yield another strict limit for the variation of the constant. Thus the measurement in the
year 2000 can be the “second” measurement of a 30-years test and the “ﬁrst” measurement of a few-years
test of the variation.

• Combining the variation of the H–Cs hfs with a variation of 1s− 2s in the hydrogen atom with respect to
the Cs hfs, one can achieve an estimation for a variation of the hydrogen hfs with respect to the Rydberg
constant. The former limit is going to be about (2 − 5) · 10−14 yr−1. The accuracy of a determination
of the 1s − 2s frequency in the hydrogen atom with respect to the Cs hfs has been improved and the
uncertainty in 1999 [122] is about 6· 10−14 yr−1. This indirect comparison between the hfs and the 1s− 2s
frequency in hydrogen can be interpreted without any diﬃculties arising from the relativistic corrections
or unclear nuclear eﬀects. Only properties of fundamental particles are to be compared: α and µp/µb.

The hydrogen experiment must have systematic errors, which are quite diﬀerent from the short-term com-
parisons. The value of µp is on for the simplest for interpreting. The result can be reproduced in diﬀer-
ent laboratories. The expected limit for the variation of the hydrogen hfs lies between 2 · 10−14 yr−1 and

29

5 · 10−14 yr−1. This depends on the possibility of averaging the values from Table 15. Some additional anal-
ysis of the old data [106, 104, 108, 109, 110, 111, 105, 112] is needed. This would include the more recent
data of international comparisons on the national primary standards utilized in the hydrogen experiments
[106, 104, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112]. In 2000 only the Rb hfs can provide a signiﬁcantly better result. From pub-
lished values, we estimate the limits from possible experiments to approximately 1.3 · 10−14 yr−1 (for Rb) and
1.1 · 10−14 yr−1 (for Hg+). The latter is diﬀerent from that presented in Table 5 because we expect signiﬁcant
correlations between the uncertainties of the original measurement and the repetition.

The strongest published limits (better than 10−16 yr−1) on the variation of fundamental constants arise from
geophysical data. However, any direct use of such estimations is not possible because of a incorrect interpretation
of the data. The best astrophysical data gives limits between 10−14 and 10−15 yr−1 and they are only slightly
better than laboratory limits. Cosmological methods (such as investigation of nucleosynthesis and microwave
background radiation) are far less precise, but they may be important if the variations at the beginning of the
evolution of the universe were faster. The clock comparisons lead to limit on a level between 10−13 and 10−14
yr−1, although, their interpretation is not quite clear. We summarize the diﬀerent methods used to search for
the variations in Table 16. The data contain the amplitude and velocity of the variations and the time and
space separations where appropriate. The scale of the space variations due to geochemical studies is estimated
from the absolute motion of the Earth (i. e. a motion with respect to the frame of the microwave background
radiation frame).

Table 16: Comparison of diﬀerent search for the variations.

We believe that the most reliable limits can be reached under laboratory conditions by comparing two results
for the same transition, each result obtained in diﬀerent time. In 2000, there are a number of possibilities to
reach results a limit of a few units of 10−14 yr−1. The most secure one will be that involving the hydrogen
hyperﬁne splitting. The limit for a possible variation of the ratio of µCs/µp is expected to be about (1−2)·10−14
yr−1. The α-variation due to the relativistic corrections is to be limited by (2 − 5) · 10−14 yr−1. The ytterbium
limit for the variation of gn/gp is expected to be 6.5 · 10−14 yr−1. We need to mention, that the preliminary
results on the second ytterbium experiment were in fact published in 1995, but these were later corrected [71].
A signiﬁcant part of the measurements was performed by the end of 1995, while the remainder was done in
mid 1996. If we accept that the experiment was done in 1995, the potential limit is 4 · 10−14 yr−1. For the
deuterium hfs, if we assume a variation of gp only, the limit is about 5.5· 10−14 yr−1, whereas if we only consider
gn-variations it is 8.1 · 10−14 yr−1. The motivation to study the deuterium hfs is that it is the only value is
sensitive to gp − |gn|, amongst those known for a while in Table 5.
In Table 16 one can note that the astrophysical, cosmological and geochemical data are not quite sensitive
to any ﬂuctuations of the constants in T ∼ 108 yr and/or L ∼ c · 108 yr. Astrophysical data yield good limits
for the value of ∆ ln α/∆z, but any interpretation of the redshift z in terms of the time separation such as e. g.

where t0 = 1.5 · 1010 yr, is actually only an estimation. It is known that the Hubble velocity-distance law is
not a strong one and this means that for any particular case, there is no well-established connection between

∆t = t0(cid:18)1 −

(1 + z)3/2(cid:19) ,

(43)

30

the redshift (associated with the velocity) and the time t(z) (associated with the distance). This also means
that would even be hard to detect a ﬂuctuation with T ≤ 109 yr. Since the interpretation is actually based
on a lack of such ﬂuctuations the astrophysical and geochemical limits are actually weaker than presented in
the table. Another problem is the correlation between space and time variations. If we suppose e. g. that the
constants increase with time and distance, we have to expect a signiﬁcant cancellation between the time and
space variations (actually we only study some distant objects from the past at a distance ∆l = c ∆t). Thence
the astrophysical data can be insensitive to some of thse correlations. It must also be mentioned that some
particular astrophysical data rather indicate in existence of some variations of the constants. E. g. a few points
in Fig. 1 of Ref. [50] conﬁrm a variation in α. However, there are a lot of data points plotted and, statistically,
perhaps those few are not important. nevertheless, the ﬁt assumes that there is only a slow drift in time and
that there are neither space variations and nor ﬂuctuations on a scale shorter than 1010 yr. We think these
points need to be re-examined in order to understand if the eﬀect is purely statistical.

In contrast to examinations of the astrophysical and geochemical data, a laboratory experiment can de-
termine the derivatives of the constants and is also sensitive to the ﬂuctuations. There should also be no
cancellation between space and time deviations: no space variation is involved because of the small absolute
velocity of Earth.

There are four basic dimensionless constants which determine any atomic spectra (in unit of Ry): α, me/mp,
gp and gn. When the frequency is measured in units of the Rydberg constant, the nuclear magnetic moment
comes in units of the Bohr magneton µb. Some of these constants enter into the equations for the energy levels
with nuclear magnetic moments constructed of the proton spin contribution µp = gp me/mp µb, the neutron
(spin) contribution µn = gn me/mp µb and the proton orbital contribution me/mp µb. The last combination
can also appear as a Dirac part of the proton spin contribution for relativistic corrections. These are known to
split the Dirac part and the anomalous part of the magnetic moment. This simple, four-constant description is
perturbed by nuclear eﬀects.

We would also like to underline that there are two kinds of searches for the variations. One is for clear
interpretation and it involves transitions without the inﬂuence of nuclear eﬀects or with only a small inﬂuence.
This is valid for secure limits on the possible variations of the constants. The other kind involves studying
transitions which may be expected to be extremely sensitive to some variations, but for which there in no
clear interpretation. Particularly, the search for sensitive values includes some geochemical study (positions of
low-lying resonances) and some laboratory investigations.

Astrophysical studies are appropriate in the search for variations of α, me/mp and gp. The limits for gn
cannot be obtained from astrophysics. If nuclear eﬀects for some magnetic moments calculated, the laboratory
investigation can give some limits for a variation of me/mp and gn. A precision laboratory study of transitions
which are not perturbed by nuclear eﬀects, can give a limit for the ﬁne structure constant and for the ratio
gp me/mp µn. The neutron magnetic moment cannot be studied successfully in this way, because of the relatively
low accuracy of the deutron hfs and the inﬂuence of the nuclear eﬀects on most magnetic moments of heavier
nuclei. The proton magnetic moment can only be investigated by using the hfs of atomic hydrogen, otherwise
the nuclear eﬀects are involved. We hope that a measurement of the hyperﬁne separation in the hydrogen atom
will be performed and that a reliable limit on the possible variation of the fundamental constant will be reached.

Acknowledgements

The idea of studying the ﬁne structure in order to search for a variation of the ﬁne structure constant was learnt
by me from Klaus Jungmann [87] and all related possibilities arise from discussions with him. Opportunity,
provided with the hydrogen hyperﬁne structure have been frequently discussed with Ted H¨ansch. Possibilities
of studying the ﬁne structure of diﬀerent neutral atoms were discussed with Martin Weitz, while for ions the
problem was discussed with Ekkehard Peik.
I was happy to learn from them that some search for the ﬁne
structure associated with the ground state suggested in the paper can be really performed. I am very grateful
to all of them. A preliminary version of this work was presented at a seminar at the PTB and I thank A.
Bauch, B. Fisher and F. Riehle for comments and useful discussions. I would like also to thank A. Godone, R.
Holzwarth, J. Reichert, M. Plimmer and D. A. Varshalovich for stimulating discussions and useful references. I
am thankful to Sile Nic Chormaic for vastly improving the legibility of this paper. The work was supported in
part by the Russian State Program ‘Fundamental Metrology’ and NATO grant CRG 960003.

A Precision measurements of the hyperﬁne separation in the hy-

drogen atom

Here we give a brief description of the most important, accurate experiments on the hfs as presented in Table
15.

• Value #2 [104] is the result of an experiment done by NBS and Harvard university. The wall-shift was

measured in early 1969 [105] and the frequency at the end of 1969.

– The result is 1 420 405.751 769 1(24) kHz. Three sources of uncertainty were considered important.

– The most signiﬁcant of these is the wall-shift, because the properties of the bulb could vary with

time: δ = 1.9 · 10−6 kHz.

– The accuracy capability of the NBS cesium standard gave δ = 0.7 · 10−6 kHz.
– The frequency dispersion of the standard since it was calibrated was obtained as δ = 1.3 · 10−6 kHz.
• Value #3 (another result from the same paper [104]) had a diﬀerent budget of errors. This is a pure NBS

experiment, with simultaneous measurements of the wall-shift and the frequency.

– The result for the frequency was found to be 1 420 405.751 766 7(18) kHz. The uncertainty due to

the cesium standard was the same:

– the accuracy capability of the standard led to δ = 0.7 · 10−6 kHz;
– The frequency dispersion since the calibration was δ = 1.3 · 10−6 kHz.
– The largest contribution to the uncertainty other than those mentioned was due to a comparison of

the maser to the cesium standard: δ = 1.0 · 10−6 kHz.

• Value #6 [108] was an NRC experiment.

– The result was 1 420 405.751 770(3) kHz.
– The uncertainty of the comparison properly was only δ = 0.7 · 10−6 kHz.
– The variation of the maser frequency during the experiment led to δ = 2.1 · 10−7 kHz.
– The instability of the cesium standard frequency gave δ = 1.4 · 10−6 kHz.

• An NPL experimental result (#5) has been frequently quoted as the most precise one [107]. However, the

ﬁnal NPL value (#7) has not been the best one.

– The result is 1 420 405.751 766 2(30) kHz and there are three sources of uncertainties.
– The measurement itself gave a statistical error δ = 1.4 · 10−6 kHz.
– The accuracy of the cesium standard itself gave δ = 1.4 · 10−6 kHz.
– Due to the same problem a comparison of the NPL cesium standard with the international time

cannot be perfect and the uncertainty was δ = 1.4 · 10−6 kHz.

• The result (#8) of an experiment in Ref. [110] has been never published in a refereed journal to the best
of our knowledge, so we cannot consider this as a ﬁnal result. However, it is important because they used
a very diﬀerent approach. In contrast to the other experiments the wall-shift was measured by using of a
ﬂexible bulb.

– The result was found to be 1 420 405.751 768 0(20) kHz.
– The maser uncertainty was δ = 1.4 · 10−6 kHz.
– The comparison itself was a little more accurate: δ = 1.2 · 10−6 kHz.
– The uncertainty due to the wall-shift was estimated as δ = 0.4 · 10−6 kHz.

• Result #11 (1 420 405.751 768(2) kHz) is an average over 5 hydrogen masers with a dispersion of their
frequencies between 1 420 405.751 765 9(17) kHz and 1 420 405.751 769 3(16) kHz. The budgets of errors
for particular masers have not been presented.

32

• Result #13 (1 420 405.751 773(1) kHz) is not in fair agreement with most other precise values. The
method was also quite diﬀerent from others as well. First, a new maser was a developed using a ﬂexible
bulb. Next, the dependence of the wall-shift on the temperature was studied and it was found that the
wall-shift vanished at a temperature T0. The result was found by interpolating the maser frequency to T0.

• We do not consider result #10 (1 420 405.751 771(6) kHz) in detail, because the accuracy is slightly
lower than for forementioned results and the statistical weight for any evaluations is small enough. The
uncertainty of a measured value of 1 420 405.751 771 0(58) kHz was mainly due to the comparisons of the
maser frequency to the local rubidium standard and the standard to the international time scale.

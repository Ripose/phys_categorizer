A mapping approach to synchronization in the ”Zajfman trap”: stability conditions
and the synchronization mechanism

Tiham´er Geyer and David J Tannor
Department of Chemical Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel

We present a two particle model to explain the mechanism that stabilizes a bunch of positively
charged ions in an ”ion trap resonator” [Pedersen etal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 (2001) 055001]. The
model decomposes the motion of the two ions into two mappings for the free motion in diﬀerent
parts of the trap and one for a compressing momentum kick. The ions’ interaction is modelled by
a time delay, which then changes the balance between adjacent momentum kicks. Through these
mappings we identify the microscopic process that is responsible for synchronization and give the
conditions for that regime.

INTRODUCTION

Ion traps are widely used to store ions for long periods
to obtain high resolution spectroscopy. Ions of the same
charge repel each other through their long range Coulomb
potential, so the trap has the purpose of localizing the
ions in the measurement region. Recently a quite sur-
prising behavior was discovered [1], where, under special
conditions, ions in an ion trap resonator do not diﬀuse
into the whole trap but stay together as a bunch for arbi-
trarily long times. This synchronized, collective motion
occurs only for certain parameters of the trap ﬁelds, but
in these regions it is stable.

This observation, which is puzzling and of intriguing
scientiﬁc interest in its own right, has important techno-
logical applications. Pedersen etal have suggested the
use of the small ”table top” ion trap as a time–of–ﬂight
mass spectrometer. As the observation time, and there-
fore the eﬀective length of the spectrometer, are in prin-
ciple only limited by collisions between the ions, mass
resolutions can be envisioned which are otherwise only
achieved in storage rings [2]. Indeed, the high resolution
spectroscopy suggested in [1] has now been achieved [3].
Until now this synchronization eﬀect has not been fully
understood; from the experimental observations [4, 5] it
appears that the trap has to be operated in a regime
where the ions’ periods in the trap increase with their
energy. Other tests point out that the focussing of the
beam inside the mirrors is important. Numerical simula-
tions conﬁrm these empirical ﬁndings, but they, too, can
not decide, if the requirements found so far, are complete
and if they really stem from the underlying microscopic
process.

A macroscopic explanation of the synchronization ef-
fect in terms of a ”negative mass instability” was recently
presented in [3].
It conﬁrms that the ions’ period has
to increase with their energy and shows that a minimal
density inside the bunch is necessary to support synchro-
nization. But, being a mean ﬁeld treatment, it can not
give a detailed explanation of the underlying microscopic
dynamics and it is insensitive to certain properties of the
trapping ﬁeld.

The aim of this paper is therefore, to set up a comple-
mentary microscopic model of the ions in the trap, which
is simple enough to be understood completely. With this
model we then can explain the basic mechanism, deter-
mine the necessary conditions for synchronization, check
their completeness and ﬁnally understand how the size
of the bunch depends on the parameters of the trap and
those of the ion beam.

In this paper we concentrate on deriving the conditions
for stability and we explain and illustrate the fundamen-
tal mechanism. The stability limits and the behavior of
the macroscopic bunch will be presented in a following
paper [6].

This paper is organized as follows: In section II we ex-
plain the model of the trap. In section III we lay out the
framework of the dynamics in terms of the mappings for
two non interacting ions. Then, in section IV, we explain
how their interaction is incorporated in the mappings.
With the interaction added we derive the conditions for
bunching, section V, and explain the underlying mecha-
nism in section VI. In section VII we conﬁrm that the
conditions and explanations given are in fact applicable
to the experiment.

II. THE MODEL OF THE TRAP

The experimental setup and the observed behavior is
described in great detail in [4, 5]. We will therefore only
cite what we need to build up the model. In the exper-
iment a bunch of ions is injected into the ”ion trap res-
onator” and its width observed, when it passes through a
ring shaped pickup electrode in the trap’s center. When
the ﬁeld gradient in the electrostatic mirrors is below a
certain threshold, the bunch does not diﬀuse.

Numerical simulations with many ions performed by
Pedersen etal have shown synchronization in a one di-
mensional model [5]. We will consider a one dimensional
model, too, and use the same simpliﬁed trap potential,
which consists of the central ﬁeld free region of length
L and two slopes with a constant gradient F , the elec-
trostatic mirrors. The two einzel lenses, which focus the

We will not treat the whole bunch, but will look at
the behavior of only two identical ions in the trap and
explain how these two ions synchronize their motion.

Since synchronization is a property of the relative co-
ordinate, we describe these two ions in relative and center
of mass (CM) coordinates:

Without loss of generality we set the charge of the ions to
q = +1 in the following. Though W (x) could be an arbi-
trary two body interaction we will think of it as the repul-
sive Coulomb potential between two positively charged
ions.

Our model will not be exact.

In order to check the
validity of the various approximations which we per-
form, we insert the values from the original experiment,
in which the bunching eﬀect was observed initially [1].
These values are given in table I. If not otherwise stated
we use atomic units in the following.

In the experiment and in the theoretical model of ref-
erence [3] the ions were found to synchronize, when the
dispersion is positive, i.e, when an ion with a higher mo-
mentum (energy) takes longer to complete one period in
the trap. With (5) we have α < 1: the ions then spend
more time in the mirror than in the central region.

Two ions with diﬀerent momenta have diﬀerent peri-
ods, which in turn can be reformulated as a diﬀerence
∆x in their distance when we propagate both ions for
the same time T . To calculate ∆x, we linearize T (6)
around the mean momentum P
2 . With the diﬀerence in
the ions’ momenta of ∆p = 2p (2) the diﬀerence between
their periods is ∆T = ∂T
∂p0 ∆p. During that interval the
ions move with the velocity P

of p < 4 a.u. With the parameters of table I the rel-

III. TWO NON INTERACTING IONS

Before we look at the coupled motion of two interact-
ing ions, we will study the non interacting case, where we
0 in (3). Adding the interaction will then mod-
set W
ify this model and the relevant mechanism will become
clearer.

≡

Instead of solving the actual equations of motion for
the two ions we ”take apart” the trap and follow the evo-
lution of the relative coordinate through the three regions
of the trap (cf. ﬁgure 1): (i) the central ﬁeld free part,
(ii) the mirrors and (iii) the kink region, which connects
these two. The evolution of the relative coordinate in
each of these parts can then be described by two–by–two
mappings of the relative coordinate and momentum. The
composite mapping, built up of these building blocks, de-
scribes the relevant dynamics.

A. Mapping the free motion

The trap potential V (x) (1) is ﬂat in the central part
of the trap and linear in the mirrors; in these regions the
Hamiltonian (3) can be separated into CM and relative
coordinates.

Without the ions’ interaction, the relative momentum
p is constant in both the central part and in the mirrors
and the distance x evolves freely as
p

x(t) = x(0) +

(10)

t.

As the times spent in the mirror and in the central part,
Tm and Tf = αTm, are ﬁxed by the CM motion (see
equations (4) and (5)), we deﬁne two mappings
M
that describe this free evolution of the relative coordinate
in the central part and in the mirrors, respectively. They
diﬀer only in their time duration:

Their interpretation is the following:

(x, p),
when the CM leaves this region again.

FIG. 2: During the time τk, when the two ions are in dif-
ferent parts of the trap potential, they experience a diﬀerent
acceleration due to the mirror potential. Integrating the dif-
ference over τk results in a compressing change of the relative
momentum (13).

B. The momentum kick approximation

For that part of the motion when the two ions are
in diﬀerent parts of the trap potential, the CM and the
relative motion are coupled for a time τk. This is the
time between when the ﬁrst ion crosses the kink between
L
the ﬂat part and one of the mirrors at
2 and when the
second one passes that point (see ﬁgure 2). During that
time the ions are accelerated relative to each other by
the trap potential. For the case of incoming ions, which
is depicted in ﬁgure 2, this time is:

Now we will look at the above deﬁned mapping

It should be noted that with the experimental param-
eters of table I, the change of x in the mirror is about

a factor of 10 bigger than ∆x after one complete period
(8). Most of the mirror’s eﬀect, however, is compensated
for by the motion in the central part. At ∂T
∂p0 = 0, which
corresponds to α = 1, both contributions exactly cancel
each other.

Equation (21) is meaningful only as long as both ions
spend time together in the mirror:

already left the mirror when the second one arrives, the
above treatment is not valid. This happens when the ions
are further away from each other than

(22)

Without interaction the two ions’ trajectories cross twice
during a given period. This happens either in the mirror
or in the central region. The probability wF for the latter
is given by the ratio between the relative distance for
which there is no solution of (21) inside the mirror, Tmp
µ ,
and the distance xmax (22), for which equation (21) is
deﬁned. With (5) it evaluates to

As p

The diﬀerent possibilities can be visualized by shifting
the two (parabolic) trajectories of the ions in ﬁgure 4
against each other: as they are plotted in ﬁgure 4 we
have 0 < ˜t < Tm
2 . This is case (i) of ﬁgure 5. If now the
trajectory of ion 1 is moved to the right, the crossing time
˜t will slide to the left, until both trajectories intersect
at their entrance into the mirror, which means ˜t = 0,
depicted in case (ii) of ﬁgure 5a. When trajectory 1 is
shifted further to the right, case (iii), the ions do not
cross inside the mirror (cf. the explanation above and
equation (23)). The crossing point reappears at ˜t = Tm
(iv), i.e., when the ions leave the mirror, and from there it
proceeds back in the direction of Tm
2 (v). These processes
are the framework into which we later incorporate the
ions’ interaction.

. In all cases the ﬁnal momentum is p′ =

Fig. 5(b) plots the relative momentum p(t) during the
course of
p.
For cases (i) and (ii) the momentum changes sign only
with the second kick, while for cases (iv) and (v) it is
reversed already with the ﬁrst kick. When the crossing
takes with ˜t < Tm
2 the second kick is the larger one, while
if ˜t > Tm
2 , the ﬁrst kick is stronger. In all these cases the
two kicks have opposite direction.

−

In the above cases x(t) changes sign in the mirror at
t = ˜t.
In the special case (iii) x does not change its
sign and both kicks work in the same direction; here the
momentum in the mirror is less than before and after it.
In this regime the faster ion enters the mirror ﬁrst and
leaves it second.

It should be emphasized that, without interaction, the
relative momentum in the central part of the trap is the
same after each period. This is the important conserved
quantity. The relative momentum in the mirror, on the
other hand, is a measure of the time delay or phase lag
of the two ions on their orbit.

IV. ADDING THE ION–ION INTERACTION

We now incorporate the (repulsive) interaction be-
tween the two ions into our model. We will see that
the repulsive interaction can be modelled as a time delay
and we will then introduce this delay into the mappings.

A. The time delay

When both ions are in one of the mirrors or in the
central part, the relative coordinate is decoupled from
the CM motion (see section III A). The free motion in
the relative coordinate is now modiﬁed by the interaction
W (x) (10). Any collision of the ions is elastic due to the
conservative Coulomb interaction. As we are only inter-
ested in the ﬁnal values of x and p, but not in the actual
solution of the equations of motion, we adopt a central
idea of scattering theory: the whole eﬀect of the ions’ col-
lision is described by a phase shift, or, for our treatment,
a time delay τ [7]. This delay modiﬁes the propagation
time for the freely evolving relative coordinate:

x(T ) = x(0) +

(T

τ )

(24)

p
µ

−

In this ansatz T stands for either Tm or Tf . The time
delay τ is clearly a function of the interaction potential
and the initial distance and momentum. It can be posi-
tive or negative; if the relative motion is delayed we have
τ > 0.

B. Modifying the mappings

With the interaction added we now use (24) instead of
(10) to map the relative coordinate in the mirrors or the

If the initial and ﬁnal distances are not in the asymp-
totic region, where W (x) = 0, we have to adjust p′, too,
to conserve the energy of relative motion. But as our
treatment does not depend on a special form of W , we
will for the following assume that the collision between
the two ions takes much less time than Tm or Tf and that
before and after the collision the interaction between the
ions can be neglected.

The mapping now is a functional of the still unspeciﬁed
delay τm = τm(W ; x, p), which itself depends on the ac-
tual form of the interaction potential.

In the non interacting case the mapping in the central
part is described by (11). Recall that the ratio of Tf
and Tm deﬁnes the parameter α, which in turn is related
to the dispersion of the trap (7). It will be convenient,
therefore, to incorporate a time delay τf into a modiﬁed
α′, deﬁned by:

During the short interval of the momentum kick we as-

the weak ion–ion interaction. Consequently the mapping

(14) remains unchanged.

With these modiﬁcations the composite mapping for

V. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

Now that we have set up all parts of the model we will
′ (28)
quantify the stability of the composite mapping
and determine the conditions under which synchroniza-
tion of the two ions’ motion occurs.

P

We follow the usual lines: the mappings are linearized
around the initial values (x, p) by calculating the Jacobi
matrix of partial derivatives:

J = J(τm, τf ) =

∂x

′

∂x
∂p





.





If the eigenvalues λ of J are complex with a length of
1, then the mapping is stable and the ions’ motion syn-
chronized; if the λ are real it is unstable and the motion
diﬀusive [8]. According to equations (14), (25) and (27)
the eigenvalues are functions of the trap parameters Tm,
α and µ and of the time delays τm and τf .

A. The elementary maps

Through the linearization the time delays become con-
stants. With the constant τm and τf , and, consequently,

the constant α′, all the maps involved are linear and their
Jacobians can be represented by 2
2 matrices. They
have the following forms:

The determinant of each of these matrices is equal to 1.
Moreover, they all have a double eigenvalue of 1 and a
ﬁxpoint at (x, p) = 0, independent of the values of Tm,
µ, α′ and τm.

The composite mappings are represented by the cor-
responding products of the elementary matrices: G =

that the ions collide either in the mirror or in the cen-
tral part; therefore one of the delays vanishes. These two
cases correspond to either α′ = α or τm = 0, respectively.

First we will consider the case of τm = 0, i.e., the
collisions take place in the central part. As discussed
above this case is rare. Then P = P 1

to the dispersion of the non interacting case (17), but
with the externally deﬁned α replaced by the modiﬁed

Which ion is faster is determined by whether α′ is bigger
or smaller than 1.

As in the non interacting case, the eigenvalues of the
composite map for the whole trap are λ1/2 = 1: the ions
separate linearly in time, if the modiﬁed dispersion is not
exactly α′ = 1.

For α < 1, which is the experimentally observed con-
dition for bunching, a negative delay τf may bring the
trap into the regime where the ”eﬀective” dispersion α′
becomes 1 and both ions have the same period. Colli-
sions in the central part may therefore synchronize the
ions by modifying the dispersion of the trap: their dif-
fering momenta remain unchanged, but the distance is,
due to the vanishing dispersion, the same every time they
pass the trap’s center. The possibility of this type of syn-
chronization is small: ﬁrst collisions in the central part
are rare events (see equation (23)) and second, with the
eigenvalue of 1 the synchronization, if it occurs, is not
stable against perturbations.

The important parameter, as we see, is composed of
the time delay τm in the mirror and the dispersion of
the trap, described by α (7). The sign of this parameter
γ determines if the relative motion of the two ions is
bounded or not: for γ > 0, which requires either τm > 0
and α < 1 or τm < 0 and α > 1, the eigenvalues λ are
complex and the ions’ motion is synchronized. For γ < 0
the eigenvalues are real and the ions separate faster than
without interaction. This happens for τm > 0 and α > 1
or for τm < 0 and α < 1.

TABLE II: Overview of the eigenvalues λ of the composite
mapping matrix P 1
(32) for collisions in the mirror and the
2
corresponding behavior of the ions. For γ = 0, i.e., τm = 0
or α = 1, which corresponds to either collisions in the central
part or no interaction at all, the eigenvalues are −1 and the
ions’ separation in phase space grows linearly in time.

Consequently the transition between real and complex
eigenvalues is very abrupt and the stability changes com-
pletely as the delay or the dispersion changes its sign.
Table II gives an overview of the behavior of the eigen-
values for the diﬀerent values that α and τm can take for
collisions in the mirror.

The stability analysis is consistent with the experimen-
tal observation and the ﬁndings of reference [3] that syn-
chronization occurs in the region of ∂T
∂p0 > 0, which in
our parametrization corresponds to α < 1, or accord-
ing to [5] to 2Eαp > 0 (9): to achieve bunching, ions
with higher energy must have a longer period. But this
criterion alone is not enough; it has to be accompanied
by a time delay in the mirror, which in turn requires a
repulsive ion–ion interaction.

For the other scenario, where the mapping is stable
for α > 1, the time delay has to be negative. This is
possible if the ions have an attractive potential, e.g., if
their charges have opposite signs, but then the electro-
static ﬁeld of the mirrors could keep only one of the ions
trapped; their motion would not even have a chance to
synchronize. For two or more equal ions only a repul-
sive Coulomb interaction is possible; any other interac-
tion like the attractive van der Waals interaction is much
weaker and can not compete with the Coulomb repulsion.
A negative time delay is also possible when the ions’ re-
pulsion becomes comparable to the guiding mirror ﬁeld:
then a repulsion between the ions can lead to a nega-
tive delay — the ions “bounce oﬀ” each other. But in
this case the ions’ repulsion would dominate the dynam-
ics and it is questionable if the very weak trap potential
would be able to actually trap the ions.

VI. EXPLAINING THE SYNCHRONIZATION
MECHANISM

From the stability analysis we identify two diﬀerent
mechanisms that can synchronize the motion of two ions:
when the ions collide in the mirror, the relation between
the momentum kicks is unbalanced, and when collisions
take place in the central part, they modify the eﬀective

exactly turns around the relative momentum of the two
independent ions: the two momentum kicks add up to
2p. During the interval in the mirror the ions approach
−
and reseparate. When the repulsive interaction is added
the ions experience a time delay and, consequently, have
less time to separate: the second momentum kick (13)
will be smaller than without interaction. This is depicted
in ﬁgure 6. The two sets of trajectories correspond to the
conﬁgurations (i) and (v) of ﬁgure 5, which shows the
non interacting case. Now the two kicks, which both are
proportional to the corresponding relative distance, will
not add up to
2p any more and the relative momentum
after the second kick will be either smaller (ﬁgure 6, case
p, depending on whether
(i)) or bigger (case (v)) than
the slower or the faster ion enters the mirror ﬁrst.
In
either case momentum is eﬀectively transferred from the
second onto the ﬁrst ion, due to the modiﬁed coupling
between the relative and the CM motion.

−

If the ﬁrst ion is the faster one it will gain additional
energy through this momentum transfer. Because the pe-
riod increases with energy, the distance between the two
ions will shrink until the slower one overtakes the faster

one. Then momentum is transferred from the faster ion,
which is now the second one, onto the slower ﬁrst one, un-
til the ﬁrst ion again will be the one with the higher mo-
mentum. This process repeats itself over and over, with
the ions eﬀectively orbiting around each other in their
relative coordinate, stably interlocking and synchroniz-
ing their motion.

In the non interacting case the momentum kicks and
the time spent in the mirror are intimately related (see
(21)). This balance is now oﬀset by the ion–ion inter-
action. In this way the very small repulsion is ampliﬁed
to counterbalance the trap’s dispersion and suppress the
separation of the ions.

B. Collisions in the central part

When the ions collide in the central part of the trap the
mechanism is completely diﬀerent. As shown in section
III D, in this regime the faster ion enters the mirror ﬁrst
and leaves second (see ﬁgure 5(iii)). For this mode to
be stationary the dynamics has to be symmetric in both
mirrors; consequently the ions have to exchange their
roles in the collision in the central part of the trap: the
ﬁrst slower ion is accelerated by the faster second, which
comes from behind. With this mechanism, which was
dubbed “bricking motion” by Zajfman etal [9], each of
the ions is the faster for one half period and the slower
one on the other side of the trap. This way both ions
have the same energy, and therefore the same period on
average, even for α

= 1.

ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXTENSIONS

In the previous sections we have derived the conditions
for stability and explained the underlying mechanism of
our mapping model. Now we will check the validity of our
description with regard to the two central simpliﬁcations
— the instantaneous ion–ion interaction and the constant
slope of the mirror potentials.

The parameter γ (34) is the same as deﬁned in the con-

is reversed. For the Poincar´e sections shown above with
τm = 3

From equation (37) we see that β decreases when the
trap is brought closer to the transition at α = 1: the
maximal momentum increases until the point that the
ellipses “break apart” and become hyperbolas.

delay

With the simple mapping model we were able to derive
the condition for a stable bunch and to give a microscopic
explanation for the coupled motion of the two ions. In
order to verify that the discrete description of the rela-
tive coordinate implied by the mapping is accurate, we
compare our results to trajectory calculations, i.e., to the
exact solution of the equations of motion of the two ions
from the full Hamiltonian (3).

To allow the ions to pass by each other in our one di-
mensional model we replace the Coulomb repulsion 1

The ”softcore parameter” or ”impact parameter” d is a
measure of how close the two ions have to come when
passing each other; it describes the diameter of the ion
beam in the trap potential. For the trajectory calculation
we set this value to d = 10 µm. This value is much
smaller than the real beam, but still the ions’ interaction
is weaker than the trap potential by about four orders of
magnitude.

relative momentum with (solid line) and without (broken
line) interaction: the ”discontinuities” of the momentum
kicks are clearly seen, cf. ﬁgure 6. Without interaction
the momentum is reversed after each mirror and returns
to its initial value: p′′ =

FIG. 9: Poincar´e sections from trajectory calculations for the
stable regime of α = 0.956 (a) and for the unstable regime
with α = 1.046 (b). The lower row is the result of the repeated
mapping P with a non constant τm from (39) for the same
values of α as (a) and (b): (c) shows the stable and (d) the
unstable regime.

The main diﬀerence between the trajectory calcula-
tions and the mapping description is that in our map-
ping approach the ions’ collisions are instantaneous and
conﬁned to the mirror. In the trajectory calculations the
ion–ion interaction takes place anywhere in the trap on a
time scale comparable to Tm for small relative momenta.
This can be seen in ﬁgure 8(b) where the relative mo-
mentum deviates visibly from the non interacting case
for about half of the time spent in the mirror.

The trajectory shown in ﬁgure 8 conﬁrms that the pro-
cesses of ﬁgures 5 and 6, which we used to explain the
mechanism, exist. In order to conﬁrm both the bunching
condition and the dominance of the collisions in the mir-
ror, we created Poincar´e sections from the trajectory cal-
culation, too. The stability of the synchronization shows
up in the overall elliptic or hyperbolic structure of the
orbits. If the ions are synchronized dominantly through
delaying collisions in the mirror, as we propose, the or-
bits will be (deformed) ellipses, whereas the alternating
“bricking motion” (cf. section VI B) will lead to a dis-
crete structure.

The Poincar´e sections from the trajectory calculation
are shown in ﬁgure 9 in panels (a) and (b). In the sta-
ble regime, i.e., for α < 1, shown in (a), the orbits are
deformed ellipses: the ions orbit around each other. The
strength of the interaction, and therefore the local cur-
vature of the orbit, varies with the relative distance and
the momentum, but it can still be summarized by a time
delay.

Only for small distances and momenta does the struc-
ture of the Poincar´e section become more complicated:
the ﬁxpoint at (x, p) = 0 is surrounded by a chaotic
layer. When the ions are very close together the eﬀective
delay changes so much between successive collisions that
the quasicontinuous orbits are broken up and consecutive
points are distributed randomly in the central region of
the Poincar´e section.

The agreement between the Poincar´e sections from the
mapping and from the trajectory calculations can be im-
proved, when the constant τm of ﬁgure 7 is replaced
by a momentum dependent delay. That the delay de-
pends only on the relative momentum is motivated by our
ansatz that the ions reach the asymptotic region again af-
ter the collisions. Then the delay does not depend upon
the initial and ﬁnal distance, but only on the speed with
which the ions pass each other. In ﬁgure 9(c) we show
the result of the mapping with the ansatz

τm = τm(p) =

The functional form and the parameters — C = 3
a.u. and p0 = 1 a.u. — were chosen to give orbits of a
comparable structure and size as the trajectory calcula-
tions of panel (a).

×

In ﬁgure 9(b) we increased α into the unstable regime
to α = 1.046. Then the trajectory calculation becomes
unstable, just as the mapping, except for a small island
around (x, p) = 0. Even this island vanishes when α is
increased further. The stability condition is α < 1 as in
the mapping, but the transition is less abrupt than with
the mapping approach.

Panel (d) plots the corresponding Poincar´e section of
the mapping with the momentum dependent delay of
equation (39). Again, as was the case with panels (a) and
(c) in the bunching regime, the overall structure is com-
parable to the trajectory calculation of (b). The small
stable island does not exist, though.

The Poincar´e surfaces of section provide a further in-
dication that the mapping ansatz is an excellent repre-
sentation of the full trajectory dynamics with respect to
both the dominant synchronization mechanism and the
stability condition.

C. Non–linear mirror ﬁelds

Above, we modelled the trap with a constant gradient
mirror ﬁeld (1). This allowed us to decouple the relative
coordinate from the CM motion. We now have to ensure
that our results and explanations are also valid when the
mirror ﬁeld is not linear in the experiment.

Two conditions must be fulﬁlled for synchronization to
occur in our model (cf. sections V B 2 and VI A): (i) the
total dispersion ∂T
∂p0 of the trap has to be positive and
(ii) the interaction has to delay the ions in the mirror, so
that the relative momentum is not exactly reversed.

11

It is easy to see that the overall positive dispersion is
not restricted to constant mirror ﬁeld conﬁgurations; any
mirror ﬁeld that increases slower than harmonic will do.
The mirror only has to be “long” enough so that it can
compensate the negative dispersion of the ﬁeld free part
of the trap.

If the mirror potential is not linear it nevertheless re-
ﬂects the individual momenta of two non interacting ions.
The relative and the CM motion can not be separated
any more, but the evolution of the relative coordinate
— and consequently the momentum reﬂection — can be
described by an alternation of inﬁnitesimally small kicks
and free evolutions.

The ions’ interaction is then added into this succession
of mappings as a set of inﬁnitesimal delays, each modify-
ing the balance between the adjacent kicks. The overall
eﬀect is the same as with the linear slope: when the ions
repel each other they leave the mirror with a smaller dis-
tance and the second ion transfers energy onto the ﬁrst.
Consequently the conditions for synchronization and
the explanations given remain unchanged for an arbitrary
mirror ﬁeld.

D. Connection to previous explanations

The approach presented here has several aspects in
common with the one recently given by Strasser etal [3].
In fact the propagation matrices for the non interacting
ions are identical. In the Strasser model the composite
mapping (17) derived from these matrices is cast into an
eﬀective reduced mass m∗ (see equations (6) and (8) of
reference [3]). When the ions repel each other, m∗ has
to be negative for the relative motion to be bound. This
leads to the bunching condition of a positive dispersion
of the trap, i.e., ∂T
∂p0 > 0. Both the trap’s dispersion and
the ions’ repulsion are described in a mean ﬁeld ansatz;
the Strasser model is therefore very robust with respect
to the exact form of the trap potential or the details of
the ions’ interaction, but can not give an explanation of
the underlying microscopic dynamics.

Both the Strasser and our model require α < 1 for
bunching, but whereas in our approach any delay τm > 0
is suﬃcient to couple the ions, the Strasser model requires
a minimum density in the bunch, i.e., a minimum inter-
action strength, because it conﬁnes the test ion to stay
inside the bunch.

By comparing equation (10) of reference [3] with our
equation (32) we can relate the static bunch’s parameters
to an eﬀective time delay ˜τm:

˜τm =

The bunch consists of N ions of charge q and mass m
and has a radius R0; ǫ0 is the dielectric constant.

From the phase space ﬂow of the Poincar´e sections we
see that in the diﬀusive regime the faster ions pass the

pickup in the front of the bunch. This was already ob-
served in [5]. In the bunching regime, though, this or-
dering is not simply inverted. The Poincar´e sections are
symmetric with respect to the coordinate and the mo-
mentum axis, consequently each of the ions is on average
in front for half of the time and has the higher momentum
for half of the time, when the CM passes the pickup.

VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have set up a model to describe the
motion of two ions in an ”ion trap resonator”, an ion trap,
which essentially consists of two spatially separated elec-
trostatic mirrors. Our one dimensional model describes
the evolution of the ions’ relative coordinate and mo-
mentum with three simple mappings: one, each, for the
free evolution in the central ﬁeld free region of the trap
and in the mirrors, while the third mapping describes the
connecting kink between these regions: here the relative
coordinate is coupled to the center of mass motion. The
coupling gives rise to an instantaneous compressing kick
in the relative momentum. The interaction between the
two ions is summarized by a time delay, which shortens
or lengthens the time for the free evolution either in the
mirror or in the central part.

The three mappings allow us to perform a linear sta-
bility analysis of the composite mapping for the whole
trap. Without delay, i.e., without interaction, the map-
ping model reproduces the behavior of two independent
ions; with the delay added we identify the criteria for
the stable synchronized motion: the trap has to be oper-
ated in a regime where the period of the ions in the trap
increases with their energy and the ions have to be de-
layed by their repulsive interaction, when they cross their
paths in the mirror. This conﬁrms the experimental ﬁnd-
ings that the dispersion of the trap has to be positive.

describe, how the interaction modiﬁes and couples the
motion of the two ions in the bunching regime: without
the interaction ions with diﬀerent energies separate lin-
early in time due to their diﬀerent periods in the trap.
A time delay in the mirror, which describes the repulsive
interaction, now modiﬁes the balance of the coupling be-
tween the relative and the CM motion at the kink, so
that during each pass through the mirror momentum is
transferred from the second onto the ﬁrst ion. This ad-
ditional energy increases the ﬁrst ion’s period and lets it
fall back against the other one until they have exchanged
their places. Now the energy is shuﬄed back onto the
other ion, until they exchange their position again and
the circle is completed: in the stable region the ions os-
cillate around each other, constantly transferring energy
back and forth between them.

Trajectory calculations conﬁrmed that the ions are
synchronized dominantly by the microscopic process of
collisions in the mirror that we had derived from the
mappings together with an instantaneous interaction.
This continuous description reproduces the stability con-
ditions, too. We also veriﬁed that our model is valid for
arbitrary forms of the mirror potential.

Our model of two ions can also be applied to the dy-
namics of a test ion inside a bunch. The microscopic
picture of the ions’ motion, which was developed in this
paper, then allows us to identify the important regions of
the trap and to explain how they shape the bunch. This
will be the subject of a forthcoming publication [6].

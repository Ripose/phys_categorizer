We demonstrate a new technique for saturated-absorption spectroscopy

using co-propagating beams that does not have the problem of crossover

resonances. The pump beam is locked to a transition and its absorption

signal is monitored while the probe beam is scanned. As the probe comes into

resonance with another transition, the pump absorption is reduced and the

signal shows a Doppler-free dip. We use this technique to measure hyperﬁne

intervals in the D2 line of 85Rb with a precision of 70 kHz, and to resolve

hyperﬁne levels in the D2 line of 39K that are less than 10 MHz apart.

Laser spectroscopy in atomic vapor is often limited by Doppler broadening. The

standard method to overcome the ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect is to use saturated-

absorption spectroscopy.1 In this technique, the laser is split into a weak probe

beam and a strong pump beam, and the two beams are sent in opposite directions

1

through the vapor. Due to the opposite Doppler shifts, only the zero-velocity atoms

(i.e. atoms moving perpendicular to the direction of the beams) interact with both

beams. For these atoms, the stronger pump beam saturates the transition and the

probe-absorption spectrum shows a Doppler-free “dip” at line center. Ideally, the

linewidth of the dip is limited only by the natural linewidth of the transition.

The above analysis is correct for two-level atoms, i.e. where the other atomic levels

are far away compared to the Doppler width. However, in most real atoms, there are

several closely-spaced hyperﬁne levels within the Doppler proﬁle. The presence of

multiple levels is a problem in saturated-absorption spectroscopy and results in what

are called “crossover resonances”. These spurious resonances occur when the laser is

tuned exactly midway between two transitions, so that for some velocity group, the

pump drives one transition while the probe drives the other. Since both transitions

start from the same ground level, the pump is still eﬀective in reducing absorption

from the probe. Crossover resonances are particularly problematic for high-resolution

spectroscopy on two levels whose spacing is only slightly larger than the natural

linewidth. In this case, the crossover resonance often swamps the real peaks and

makes it impossible to resolve the two transitions.

In this article, we demonstrate an alternate technique for saturated-absorption

spectroscopy that does not have the problem of crossover resonances. The technique

uses to advantage the multilevel structure of the atom in creating diﬀerential ab-

sorption between the pump and probe beams. The basic idea is to have the two

beams co-propagate through the vapor, with the pump frequency ﬁxed on one tran-

sition while the probe is scanned over the other transitions. Unlike in conventional

2

saturated-absorption spectroscopy, both beams have roughly equal intensities, and it

is the absorption of the pump beam that is monitored. Since the pump is locked to

a transition, it is absorbed only by the zero-velocity atoms. The absorption signal

remains constant as the probe is scanned since the probe is generally absorbed by

a diﬀerent velocity group. However, as the probe comes into resonance with another

transition for the zero-velocity group, the absorption of the pump is reduced and the

signal shows a Doppler-free dip.

There are two primary advantages to our scheme. The ﬁrst, as mentioned earlier,

is the absence of crossover resonances. The second is that the signal appears on a ﬂat

background. This is diﬀerent from conventional saturated-absorption spectroscopy

where the probe absorption has an underlying Doppler proﬁle which can aﬀect the

determination of the peak centers. We have applied this technique to spectroscopy on

the D2 lines of 85Rb and 39K. In the case of Rb, we measure the hyperﬁne interval

between the F = 1 and 2 levels in the 5P3/2 state with a precision of 70 kHz. In K, we

are able to resolve all three hyperﬁne transitions in the D2 line, which are completely

merged in ordinary saturated-absorption spectroscopy.

The ﬁrst set of experiments were done with a vapor of 85Rb atoms. The ex-

perimental schematic is shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe beams are derived

from two frequency-stabilized diode lasers2 operating on the Rb D2 line at 780 nm

(5S1/2 ↔ 5P3/2 transition). The intensity in each beam is about 10 µW/cm2. The

two beams co-propagate through a room-temperature vapor cell such that the angle

between them is less than 10 mrad. The pump laser is locked to a hyperﬁne transition

using saturated-absorption spectroscopy in another Rb vapor cell. The probe laser is

3

scanned by double-passing through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and scanning

the AOM frequency. The double passing is necessary to maintain directional stability

of the beam, which can otherwise lead to systematic shifts of the peak positions. The

probe intensity is also stabilized by adjusting the rf power into the AOM in a servo

loop.

A normal saturated-absorption spectrum for the D2 line in 85Rb is shown in Fig.

2. The underlying Doppler proﬁle has been subtracted using a second probe beam

that does not interact with the pump. The spectrum is for transitions starting from

the F = 2 ground level. The F ′ = 1 and 2 levels in the excited state are barely visible

because they are only 30 MHz apart3 and overlap with the crossover resonance in

between. The linewidth of the peaks is 12–15 MHz compared to the natural linewidth

of 6 MHz. The primary causes for the increased linewidth are power broadening due to

the pump beam and a small angle between the counter-propagating pump and probe

beams. In addition, the lineshape of the peaks depends crucially on the intensities in

the two beams. At high pump intensities, optical-pumping eﬀects and the eﬀect of

velocity redistribution of the atoms from radiation pressure leads to inversion of the

peaks or distortion of their Lorentzian lineshape.4 This is seen in the lower trace of

Fig. 2 where the pump intensity has been increased by a factor of 2. The F ′ = 1 and

2 peaks get distorted and the F ′ = (1, 2) crossover resonance becomes inverted.

The dramatic improvement in the spectrum with our new technique is seen in

Fig. 3. The pump laser is locked to the F = 2 ↔ F ′ = 3 transition while the probe

laser is scanned over a frequency range of 50 MHz covering the F ′ = 1 and 2 hyperﬁne

levels. The pump-transmission signal shows two well-resolved peaks corresponding to

4

these levels. The spectrum appears on a ﬂat background and there is no crossover

resonance in between. The peaks also have symmetric Lorentzian lineshapes with no

signiﬁcant pulling due to the neighboring peak.

There are two advantages to scanning the probe laser using an AOM instead of

the grating angle that controls the optical feedback. The ﬁrst is that it guarantees

linearity of the scan since the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that determines the

AOM frequency has a linear transfer function. Secondly, the scan axis has absolute

frequency calibration once the voltage-to-frequency transfer function of the VCO is

known. This transfer function is readily measured using a frequency counter. We

have used the advantage of a calibrated frequency scan to precisely determine the

hyperﬁne interval in Fig. 3. By ﬁtting Lorentzians to the two peaks, we determine the

peak centers with a precision of 50 kHz. This yields the value of the interval to be

29.35(7) MHz. The result is in good agreement with earlier values of 29.26(3) MHz5

and 29.30(3) MHz6 obtained by us using other techniques. The high level of precision

in the current work is a direct consequence of being able to resolve the two transitions

without an intervening crossover resonance. One potential source of error in hyperﬁne

measurements is a systematic shift in the lock point of the laser from peak center.

However, in our scheme, this is not a problem because both pump and probe beams

address the same velocity group. Thus a shift in the pump-laser lock point causes the

entire set of hyperﬁne peaks to shift but the intervals do not change.

We have performed a second set of experiments with 39K. For this, the two diode

lasers are chosen to operate on the D2 line of K at 767 nm (4S1/2 ↔ 4P3/2 transition).

The probe laser does not pass through an AOM but is scanned by scanning the grating.

5

The consequent variation in the direction is negligible for the results presented here.

The beams co-propagate through an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) glass cell maintained

at a pressure below 10−8 torr using an ion pump. K vapor is produced by heating a

getter source7 with a current of 2.6 A. The UHV environment is necessary to minimize

linewidth broadening due to background collisions. The getter source also gives us

control over the amount of K vapor in the cell, which is optimized for obtaining the

narrowest linewidth.

In Fig. 4, we show the spectrum for F = 2 → F ′ transitions in 39K. With

conventional saturated-absorption spectroscopy, we obtain a single peak containing

all the transitions. The underlying Doppler proﬁle is also seen. The lineshape of the

peak is a convolution of 6 peaks lying within 30 MHz of each other.3 Indeed, it is

hard to identify the location of the peak center with respect to the actual hyperﬁne

transitions. By contrast, the new technique shows the locations of the three levels

quite clearly. While the linewidth is still large enough that the peaks overlap, there

is no ambiguity in identifying their locations.

In summary, we have demonstrated a technique for saturated-absorption spec-

troscopy in multilevel atoms using co-propagating pump and probe beams. The pump

laser is locked to a transition so that it addresses only the zero-velocity atoms. The

transmission of the pump shows Doppler-free peaks when the probe comes into reso-

nance with another transition for the same zero-velocity atoms. The main advantages

of the technique are the absence of crossover resonances and the appearance of the

signal on a ﬂat background. We demonstrate the power of this technique for hyper-

ﬁne spectroscopy of closely-spaced levels by using an AOM to measure the smallest

6

interval in the 5P3/2 state of 85Rb. We are also able to resolve hyperﬁne transitions in

the D2 line of 39K. In the current work, we have used two lasers to generate the pump

and probe beams, which appears disadvantageous compared to the use of one laser

in conventional saturated-absorption spectroscopy. However, it is possible to generate

the probe beam from the pump laser using one or more AOMs, which has advan-

tages for scanning the probe in a calibrated manner. Finally, the pump intensity in

our scheme has to be kept very small. At higher intensities, we see clear evidence of

dressed states created due to the coherent driving by the pump laser. Indeed, we have

used this technique as a means of studying dressed states in room-temperature vapor

without complications from Doppler broadening.8

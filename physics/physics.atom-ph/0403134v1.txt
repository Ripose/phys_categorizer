(Dated: Received date; Accepted date)
Relativistic coupled-cluster(RCC) theory has been employed to calculate the lifetime of the 62P3/2
state of single ionized lead(207P b) to an accuracy of 3% and compared with the corresponding
value obtained using second order relativistic many-body perturbation theory(RMBPT). This is
one of the very few applications of this theory to excited state properties of heavy atomic systems.
Contributions from the diﬀerent electron correlation eﬀects are given explicitly.

INTRODUCTION

(2.1)

Trapped and laser cooled ions are excellent candidates for
high precision measurements[1, 2]. 207P b+ is the heaviest
atomic ion to be trapped and cooled to date[3, 4]. The
lifetime of the 6p3/2(62P3/2) state of this ion has been
measured to an accuracy of 2%[5]. The transition from
this excited state to the ground state 6p1/2(62P1/2) is pre-
dominantly magnetic dipole(M1) in character, but there
is a small electric quadrupole(E2) component as well.
The M1 and E2 transition rates depend on the inverse
cubic and quintic powers of the transition wavelength re-
spectively. The lifetime of the 62P3/2 for P b+ must there-
fore be calculated by an accurate relativistic many-body
method. Indeed a comparision of the measured and cal-
culated values of the lifetime for this state would consti-
tute a stringent test of the theoretical approach on which
the calculation is based. In addition, a precise knowledge
of this lifetime is useful in determining the abundance of
Pb in the planetary nebula NGC 7027[6, 7]. The work in
this paper uses the non-linear RCC theory to calculate
this lifetime. This theory has been successfully applied
earlier to diﬀerent atomic systems[8, 9, 10, 11], but it
has seldom been used to study excited state properties
for heavy atoms or ions. This is the ﬁrst accurate calcu-
lation of the lifetime of the 6p2P3/2 state of P b+ to our
knowledge. We compare our RCC results for the excited
energy and lifetime with those obtained from second or-
der RMBPT(2).

III. METHOD OF CALCULATION :
RELATIVISTIC COUPLED CLUSTER THEORY

The relativistic Dirac-Coulomb atomic Hamiltonian is
given by

H =

c~α.~pj + (β − 1)c2 + Vnuc(rj ) +

(3.1)

Xj

rjl

Xj<l

where ~α and β are the usual Dirac matrices and Vnuc(rj )
is the potential at the site of the jth electron due to the
atomic nucleus. The energy eigen values are scaled with
respect to the rest mass energy of the electron. We ﬁrst
solve the relativistic Hartree-Fock(Dirac-Fock) equations
to obtain the single particle orbitals and their energies.

The residual Coulomb interaction is given by

Ves =

−

UDF (rj )

(3.2)

rjl

Xj<l

The single particle orbitals are obtained by solving the
following equation self-consistently

(tj + UDF (rj ))|φj i = ǫj|φji

(3.3)

where

and

tj = c~α · ~pj + (β − 1)c2 + Vnuc(rj)

UDF |φj i =

hφa|

|φai|φj i − hφa|

The single particle relativistic orbitals can be expressed
as

|φj (r)i =

1
r (cid:18)

Pj (r)|χκj mj i
Qj(r)|χ−κj mj i (cid:19)

where Pj(r) and Qj(r) are the radial part of the large
and small components respectively and |χκj mj i and
|χ−κj mj i are their respective spin angular momentum
components. ǫj’s are the single particle energies.

HeT |Φi = EeT |Φi

(3.5)

The energy and amplitude determining equations are
hΦK | ¯H|Φi = EδK,0

(3.6)

where ¯H = e−T HeT ,
|ΦKi is a determinantal state
with K = 0,1,2.... representing the reference state and
excited determinantal states. We have considered all
possible non-linear terms in T- operator for its amplitude
determining equations.

Goldstone[17,
angular momentum
diagrammatic[17, 20] techniques are used for evalu-
ating diﬀerent radial integrals and angular factors. The
normal ordered Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

and

HN ≡ H − hΦ|H|Φi = H − EDF ,

(3.7)

We have truncated our wavefunction expansion at the
level of singles and doubles(CCSD) and all possible non-
linear terms have been included in the above equation.

The ground state of P b+ contains only one valence
electron; namely the 6p1/2 orbital. One way to evaluate
the ground state energy of P b+ is to ﬁrst compute the
wavefunctions for the closed shell system P b++ using
the above closed shell CC approach and then append a
valence electron (6p1/2 orbital) using the open shell CC
(OSCC) method as follows. The same procedure has
been followed to obtain the excited 6p3/2 state.

The new reference state of the open-shell system with
one valence electron v can be expressed as[21]

|Φvi ≡ a†

v|Φi

(3.8)

where a†
v is the particle creation operator. The ex-
act atomic states are deﬁned now, using the Fock-space
OSCC method, as[17, 21]

|Ψvi = eT {eSv }|Φvi

(3.9)

where Sv is the valence excitation operator. Since the
system under consideration has only one valence electron,
the S- operator exponetial series naturaly truncates at
linear term, i.e. the open-shell wavefunction has the form

|Ψvi = eT {1 + Sv}|Φvi

(3.10)

We have employed the RCC to incorporate correlation ef-
fects among electrons due to the residual Coulomb inter-
action. In this approach the exact atomic wavefunction
for the closed-shell system can be expressed as[17]

In the next step, we include approximate triple exci-

where ǫi is the orbital energy of the i’th orbital. Note
that we use notations a,b,c..., p,q,... and i,j,...
for the
core, particle and generic orbitals respectively.

The wavefunction in the framework of many-body per-
turbation theory(MBPT) can be written as

|ΨMBP T i = |Φvi + |Φ(1)i + |Φ(2)i + |Φ(3)i + ...

(3.13)

where |Φ(n)i is the nth order correction to the wavefunc-
tion |Φi. Each order corrected wavefunction is a linear
combination of all excited determinantal states with re-
spect to |Φi. Gathering excitations of the same order
together from each of the corrected wavefunction we can
rewrite the wavefunction of the many-body system as

and C(1, 1), C(1, 2), ...etc. are the perturbation co-
eﬃcients for each order of the corrected wavefunction.
The ﬁrst index of the superscript represents the order of
the pertubation and the second represents the excitation
level. Therefore, each T- operator accounts for the
correlation eﬀects from all orders of the perturbed
wavefuction. The above relation shows that unlike in the
MBPT, where the correction to correlation is computed
in coupled-cluster theory once the
order by order,
leading correlation corrections are identiﬁed, a subset
of terms to all orders which improve these corrections
are also included. Diagrammatic representation for this
theory has been shown in the Fig. 1.

eﬀective three-body diagrams will contribute to both the
numerator and the denominator. The fully contracted
terms are excluded on the basis of the linked-Diagram
theorem[17] in the evaluation of the ¯O and ¯N . All the
one-body terms have been taken into account as their
contribution to the correlation eﬀects is the largest. The
dominat parts of the two-body terms have also been
computed[10, 24]. Finally, these terms are contracted
with S†

IV. RESULTS AND DISCISSIONS:

We have used Gaussian type orbitals(GTO) for the con-
struction of single paricle orbitals of the Dirac-Fock
wavefunction(|Φi), whose expression is given by[15]

matrix elements, the total contribution of OS1i and its
conjugate is larger than OS2i and its conjugate term. In
its lowest order OS1i corresponds to the Brueckner pair
correlation and OS2i to core polarisation. The largest
contribution to electron correlation comes from the
pair correlation eﬀects. The reduced transition matrix
elements for M1 and E2 operators are given in table II.
The important contributions from the one-body terms
of these two quantities are given in table III.

The net probability for a given transition which allows
two diﬀerent channels is given by[13]

with k=0,1,2,... for s, p, d,· · · respectively. The function
F (L/S)
(r) stands for the large(L) and small(S) compo-
i,k
nents of the dirac wavefunction. c(L/S)
is the expansion
coeﬃcient of the corresponding large and small compo-
nents respectively. The kinetic balance condition[25] has
been imposed between the large and small components
of the GTOs. For the exponents, the even tempering
condition

i

αi = αi−1β,

i = 1, · · · , N

(4.2)

has been applied. Here, N stands for the total number
of basis functions for a speciﬁc symmetry. In the present
calculation, we have taken α◦ = 0.00825 and β = 2.73
for all symmetries. We have considered 13s1/2, 13p1/2,
13p3/2, 11d3/2, 11d5/2, 8f5/2, 8f7/2, 7g7/2 and 7g9/2
active orbitals. All core electrons have been excited in
the present calculation.

We have obtained an accuracy of better than one percent
for the ionisation potentials of both 62P1/2 and 62P3/2
states. The ionisation potential at the Dirac-Fock level
is calculated using Koopman’s theorem. As can be seen
from table I the correlation contributions are about 5%
and 6% for the 62P1/2 and the 62P3/2 states respectively.
However, the CC excitation energy improves only by
about one and half percent over the DF value and
deviates by 2.7% from the experimental value. The
excitation energy between these two states is calculated
using eq. (3.18) and it’s value is given in table IV. From
table II, it is clear that for both the M1 and E2 transition

where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes through diﬀerent
branches and τ is the total lifetime. The results obtained
for ′τ ′
1 which represents the M1 lifetime and ′τ ′
2 the E2
lifetime are given in table IV. The lifetime for the 62P3/2
state obtained using RCC is 0.0425 second which has an
accuracy about 3%. The lifetime result of our second or-
der RMBPT calculation is 0.0418 second. This suggests
that there would be a strong cancellation of the correla-
tion eﬀects from the higher order RCC contributions.

V. CONCLUSION

Relativistic coupled-cluster theory has been applied to
calculate ionisation potential and transition matrix ele-
ments for M1 and E2 operators to determine the lifetime
for the 62P3/2 state of the singly ionised lead. The accu-
racy of the calculation is about 3%.

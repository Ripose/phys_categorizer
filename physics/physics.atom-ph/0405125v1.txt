Abstract

A kinetic approach for the evolution of ultracold neutral plasmas including interionic correlations

and the treatment of ionization/excitation and recombination/deexcitation by rate equations is

described in detail. To assess the reliability of the approximations inherent in the kinetic model,

we have developed a hybrid molecular dynamics method. Comparison of the results reveals that

the kinetic model describes the atomic and ionic observables of the ultracold plasma surprisingly

well, conﬁrming our earlier ﬁndings concerning the role of ion-ion correlations [Phys. Rev. A 68,

010703]. In addition, the molecular dynamics approach allows one to study the relaxation of the

ionic plasma component towards thermodynamical equilibrium.

INTRODUCTION

Recent experiments have produced ultracold neutral plasmas from a small cloud of laser-

cooled atoms conﬁned in a magneto-optical trap [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In one type of experiments

[1, 2, 3], a plasma was produced by photoionizing laser-cooled Xe atoms with an initial

ion temperature of about 10 µK. By tuning the frequency of the ionizing laser, the initial

electron energy Ee could be varied corresponding to a temperature range 1 K < Ee/kB <

1000 K, and the subsequent expansion of the plasma into the surrounding vacuum was

studied systematically. In a complementary type of experiment [4, 5, 6], ultracold Rb and

Cs atoms were laser-excited into high Rydberg states rather than directly ionized. In these

experiments, also the spontaneous evolution of the Rydberg gas into a plasma has been

observed. The time evolution of several quantities characterizing the state of the plasma,

such as the plasma density [1, 2], the degree of ionization [4, 5, 6] or the energy-resolved

atomic level population [3] have been measured using various plasma diagnostic methods.

These experiments, which have paved the way towards an unexplored regime of ionized

gases, give rise to new phenomena in atomic physics as well as in plasma physics. Hence, a

number of diﬀerent theoretical approaches have been formulated to cover diﬀerent aspects

of these experiments [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

An important issue is the question whether the plasma produced would be strongly cou-

pled or not. The correlation strength is determined by the Coulomb coupling parameter

Γ = e2/(akBT ) with the Wigner-Seitz radius a [14]. A plasma is called “strongly coupled” if

Γ

1, i.e. if the Coulomb interaction between the plasma particles largely exceeds the ther-

≫

mal kinetic energy. In this case, interesting ordering eﬀects such as Coulomb crystallization

can be observed [15, 16]. For the initial conditions of the NIST experiments [1, 2, 3], however,

the development of equilibrium electron-electron correlations leads to a rapid heating of the

electron gas, which prevents the electron Coulomb coupling parameter Γe from exceeding

unity [7]. The same has been argued for an ion plasma in [17]. Since the electron dynamics

proceeds on a much smaller timescale than the ion motion, in [7, 8] the electron heating

could be studied for the early stage of the plasma evolution only, where the ionic component

does not show dynamical eﬀects. On the other hand, ion heating has only been studied in

the framework of a model system, consisting of a homogeneous gas of Debye-screened ions

[17], such that the inﬂuence of the subsequent expansion could not be explored.

2

The ﬁrst quantitative comparison with experimental observations has been given in [10],

with the plasma dynamics modeled within a hydrodynamical approach and ionization, exci-

tation and recombination treated by a separate set of rate equations. Since this model does

only account for the mean-ﬁeld potential created by the charges, it cannot describe eﬀects

of particle correlations. However, it has also been shown there that the electronic Coulomb

coupling parameter Γe does not exceed a value of

0.2 during the plasma expansion due to

≈

heating by three-body recombination. Thus, the inﬂuence of electron-electron correlations

on the dynamics of the plasma could be neglected. On the other hand, three-body recombi-

nation does not inﬂuence the ionic temperature, so that the ions can heat up only through

correlation heating (and energy exchange with the electrons, which, however, is very slow).

Since the ionic temperature was set to zero in [10], the role of ion-ion correlations could not

be explored. In a preliminary study [13], we showed that they indeed change the evolution of

the system quantitatively, though not qualitatively. In the following, we will give a detailed

account of the kinetic model used in [13] and of all relevant ingredients. We will also develop

a hybrid molecular dynamics (H-MD) approach which treats the electronic plasma compo-

nent in an adiabatic approximation while the ions are fully accounted for. Such an approach

permits the description of situations where the ions are strongly coupled [16, 18], which is

clearly beyond the capabilities of the simple kinetic model. Nevertheless, for the typical

situations realized in the experiments [1, 2, 3], comparison of the two theoretical approaches

yields very good agreement, corroborating our ﬁndings reported earlier [13] and establishing

ﬁrmly that one can capture the relevant physics with the relatively simple kinetic approach.

II. THEORETICAL APPROACH

Our kinetic approach is similar to the one of [10]. The main diﬀerence is the inclu-

sion of ion-ion correlations (IC) which will be described in detail below. Brieﬂy, a set of

kinetic equations is formulated for the evolution of the plasma (subsection II A), while ioniza-

tion/excitation and recombination/deexcitation are taken into account on the basis of rate

equations (subsection II B). In order to test the applicability and accuracy of this model,

we have developed a less approximative and more ﬂexible but computationally much more

demanding approach. It uses molecular dynamics for the ionic motion while the electron

component is treated as a ﬂuid assuming a quasi-steady state (subsection II C).

A. Kinetic description

Starting from the ﬁrst equation of the BBGKY hierarchy, the evolution equation for the

one-particle distribution function fα(r, v, t) of the free plasma charges is obtained as

mα (∂t + v∂r) fα(r, v, t) =

[∂rϕαβ(r, r′)] ∂vfαβ(r, v, r′, v′, t) dr′dv′ ,

(1)

Xβ Z

where α, β label the particle species (e,i for electrons and ions, respectively), fαβ(r, v, r′, v′, t)

denotes the two-particle distribution function for the corresponding particle species and

ϕαβ = qαqβ/

is the Coulomb interaction potential between the charges qα and qβ.

Electron-electron correlations are very small during the plasma expansion, since the electrons

will quickly heat up due to three-body recombination and the additional heating due to

correlation eﬀects is small in comparison [10]. Hence, we neglect electron-electron as well

as electron-ion correlations, leaving only IC as a possible inﬂuence on the plasma dynamics

beyond the mean-ﬁeld level. On this level of approximation the ion kinetic equation can be

written as

ﬁeld potential created by all plasma charges. Since me/mi ≪

which corresponds to the initial state of the experiments under consideration. As soon as IC

are taken into account via the correlation pressure ρiFii in Eq. (10), however, Eqs. (14) are

no longer exact solutions of Eq. (2). Using Eq. (12), the last term on the right-hand side of

Eq. (10) can be rewritten as ρiFii =

∂ρi ∂rρi. Interpreting this term as a local nonideal

Obviously, this treatment is not unique. Since, as discussed above, the ansatz (14) does not

solve Eq. (10) exactly, multiplying Eq. (10) by diﬀerent functions of r and averaging over

the plasma volume will lead to slightly diﬀerent evolution equations for the parameter γ.

Here, supported by a comparison with our numerical results from the MD simulations, to

be discussed below, we assume as in [13] that the functional form of the hydrodynamical

quantities of Eqs. (14) is not altered by the inclusion of IC, while the dynamics of the

parameters appearing in Eqs. (14) is determined from the equations (6) for the moments

of the distribution function. Clearly, such an approximation can not be a priori justiﬁed.

Hence, it must be validated a posteriori by comparison with more sophisticated methods

which do not rely on a reduction of the plasma description to a few macroscopic parameters.

With this procedure, we arrive at the following set of equations for the width σ of the

plasma cloud, its expansion velocity γr as well as ionic and electronic temperature Ti and

The last equation (15d) has been derived from the electron kinetic equation by making use

of the quasineutrality condition. The set of Eqs. (15) slightly diﬀers from that presented in

∂(uiiρi)
∂ρi

with our numerical MD results shows that Eqs. (15) yield a slightly better quantitative

R

agreement, while the principal inﬂuence of IC on the plasma dynamics, which has been

partly discussed in [13], is the same. Eqs. (15) provide a transparent physical picture of

the expansion dynamics. First, Eq. (15d) together with (15a) reﬂects the adiabatic cooling

of the electron gas, i.e. Teσ2 = const. The ion temperature, on the other hand, is not

only aﬀected by the adiabatic cooling, expressed by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (15c), but also

changes due to the development of IC, which is taken into account by the last term in Eq.

(15c). Furthermore, these correlations reduce the ion-ion interaction and therefore lead to

an eﬀective negative acceleration, expressed by the Uii/3-term in Eq. (15b), in addition to

the ideal thermal pressure. This contribution, which corresponds to the average nonideal

pressure known from homogeneous systems [14, 15], also leads to an eﬀective potential in

which the ions move. As they expand in this potential, the thermal energy changes due to

energy conservation, as expressed by the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (15c).

Finally, combining eqs.(15) yields a second integral of motion, namely the total energy of

the plasma

Etot =

(kBTe + kBTi) +

miγ2σ2 + Uii .

(16)

Although the set of equations (15) determines the time evolution of all relevant macroscopic

plasma parameters, namely its width, expansion velocity, electron and ion temperature, it

is not a closed set since an evolution equation for the correlation energy Uii which enters

Eq. (15c) is missing. Initially, the plasma is completely uncorrelated, so that Uii(t = 0) = 0.

However, the initial state corresponds to a non-equilibrium situation, and the plasma will

relax towards thermodynamic equilibrium, thereby building up correlations. A precise de-

scription of this relaxation process in the framework of a kinetic theory is rather complicated

and requires a considerable numerical eﬀort [20]. We therefore employ a linear approxima-

tion for the relaxation of the two-particle correlation function, the so-called correlation-time

approximation [21],

(17)

Here, τcorr [21, 22] is the characteristic timescale for the relaxation of particle correlations and

7

weq
ii

is the equilibrium pair correlation function, which in our case still depends on time via the

evolving one-particle distribution function since the plasma is freely expanding. As shown

in [23] the correlation time τcorr can be well estimated by the inverse ionic plasma frequency.
Hence, in our calculations we set τcorr = ω−1
mi/(4πe2 ¯ρi), where ¯ρi = Ni/(4πσ2)3/2 is

p,i =
the average ionic density of the plasma. Such a linear approximation is good only for small

p

deviations of wii from its equilibrium form. Clearly, this is not the case in the initial stage

of the gas evolution. However, after the initial phase of correlation heating the system stays

very close to its slowly changing local equilibrium, and one may expect Eq. (17) to yield

good results. Under the same conditions that lead to Eqs. (11) and (12), one easily veriﬁes

that Eq. (17) leads to

with A1 =

A1/√A2, which yields an accurate

interpolation between the low-Γ Abe limit and the high-Γ behavior obtained by Monte Carlo

and MD simulations. It should be noted that in the present situation uii depends on time

since the plasma expands. Hence, Γ and with it the thermodynamical equilibrium change

(18)

(19)

in time.

The set of equations (15) describes the evolution of the plasma part of the system, i.e. a

system of Ni ions and electrons. Due to ionization and recombination events occurring during

the plasma expansion (discussed in detail in the following subsection), this number Ni, and

hence also the total mass M = Nimatom, is not constant over the course of the evolution.

However, such a treatment completely neglects the inﬂuence of the bound Rydberg atoms

on the dynamics. One may argue that they do not inﬂuence the plasma evolution since

they do not interact with the ions or electrons by Coulomb interaction. On the other

hand, a Rydberg atom may carry a signiﬁcant amount of kinetic energy, gained from the

acceleration by the electron pressure before its formation by three-body recombination. In

a simple approximation, we assume equal hydrodynamical velocities and density proﬁles for

8

the ions and atoms, in order to account for this eﬀect. This implies that the expansion of

the neutral Rydberg atoms can be taken into account by replacing the mass Nimi of the

ions by the mass of the total system (Ni + Na)mi, where Na is the number of atoms. We

therefore replace the ion mass mi by an eﬀective mass (1 + Na/Ni)mi in Eq. (15b). The

quality of this approximation can, of course, also be checked by comparison with the H-MD

description, see below.

B.

Ionization and Recombination

As demonstrated in [10], a satisfactory description of the dynamics of an ultracold plasma

can be achieved by combining a hydrodynamic treatment of the plasma evolution with

rate equations accounting for inelastic collisions between the plasma particles and Rydberg

atoms. The rate equation for the change of density of Rydberg atoms in a state with

principal quantum number n reads

˙ρa(n) = ρe

K(n, p)ρa(n)] + ρe [R(n)ρeρi −

I(n)ρa(n)] ,

(20)

where K(p, n) is the rate coeﬃcient for electron impact (de)excitation from level p to level n,

and R(n) and I(n) describe three-body recombination into and electron-impact ionization

from level n, respectively. The rate coeﬃcients K, R and I have been taken from the classic

work of Mansbach and Keck [25]. Additional processes, such as, e.g., ionization by black-

body radiation or from dipolar atom-atom interactions, are easily included in Eq. (20) if the

corresponding rates are available. Such processes are essential for a description of the early

stages of the evolution of a system starting with a Rydberg gas [4, 5, 6], but are of minor

importance in situations starting from a pure plasma.

In this framework, the evolution of the system is obtained by solving Eqs. (15a)-(15c)

together with Eq. (20) while the electron temperature is now obtained from the modiﬁed en-
n Nan−2

ergy conservation relation Etot+Ea = const. instead of Eq. (15d), where Ea =

is the total energy of the Rydberg atoms and

= 13.6 eV.

C. Hybrid molecular dynamics treatment

As we will show in section III, the kinetic description of the previous subsections is

able to describe the plasma dynamics to a surprisingly large extent. However, one of the

main motivations of this work is the study of the role of IC, which are incorporated in

the model only in an approximate way. To assess their inﬂuence on the dynamics reliably,

a more sophisticated approach is required, e.g. molecular dynamics simulations which fully

incorporate the ionic interactions. However, a full MD simulation of both, electrons and ions,

is computationally very demanding, and only the very early stage of the system evolution

can be described in this way [7]. On the other hand, as argued above, electronic correlations

are not important for the plasma dynamics, so that only IC have to be accounted for in

full while the inﬂuence of the electrons on the dynamics may be treated on a mean-ﬁeld

level. Moreover, we have seen that the timescale of equilibration of the electronic subsystem

is orders of magnitude shorter than that of the ionic subsystem and the timescale of the

plasma expansion. This observation led us to use an adiabatic approximation in subsection

II A, where the electrons are assumed to equilibrate instantaneously, assuming a Maxwellian

velocity distribution with a well-deﬁned temperature and a spatial proﬁle determined from

the total mean-ﬁeld potential of the plasma charges. The clear separation of timescales

suggests that this adiabatic approximation is well justiﬁed, hence we will keep it in the

following. Consequently, we have developed a hybrid approach where the electrons are

treated on a hydrodynamical level as in the kinetic description above, while the ions are

propagated individually with their mutual interaction and the inﬂuence of the electrons on

the ions enters via the electronic mean-ﬁeld potential. This hybrid approach permits the

use of much larger timesteps in the propagation of the system, since the electronic dynamics

needs not to be followed in detail but only the ionic motion has to be resolved in time.

Consequently, the evolution of the system can be followed over the experimental timescales.

Furthermore, the approximate treatment of IC in the kinetic model of subsection II A can

be tested. Finally, beyond the scope of the present work, we have shown [16] that the

present H-MD approach can describe situations where the ionic plasma component is so

strongly coupled that crystallization of the ions sets in. Such a scenario is clearly beyond

the capabilities of a kinetic approach.

As discussed above, the electrons are still treated as a ﬂuid, while we lift the quasineutral

10

approximation by calculating the resulting mean-ﬁeld potential from the Poisson equation

∆ ¯ϕ = 4πe2 (ρe −
However, using Eq. (4) poses a conceptual diﬃculty [11] since the mean-ﬁeld potential ap-

(21)

ρi) .

proaches a ﬁnite value at large distances and therefore leads to a non-normalizable electron

density. This problem, which has been discussed for a long time in an astrophysical context

[26], reﬂects the fact that a substantial fraction of the electrons indeed escapes the ﬁnite po-

tential barrier at long times during the relaxation process until the total kinetic energy of all

electrons is less than the height of the potential well. On the timescales under consideration,

however, typically only a small amount of the electrons escapes the plasma volume, until

the resulting charge imbalance becomes large enough to trap the remaining electrons, which

quickly reach a quasi-steady state forming a temporarily quasineutral plasma in the central

region. We account for this electron loss by determining the fraction of trapped electrons

from the results of Ref. [1].

The corresponding steady-state distribution, derived for the study of globular clusters, is

of the form [27]

where χ = mev2

Knowledge of the electron density then permits propagation of the ions in the electron

numerical eﬀort scales with N 2 rendering a treatment of large particle numbers diﬃcult.

In order to simulate particle numbers relevant to the experiments, we have adapted a hi-

erarchical treecode originally designed for astrophysical problems, ﬁrst described in [28].

This method provides a numerically exact solution of the ion equations of motion Eq. (24),

while the numerical eﬀort grows only as N ln N with increasing N. More details about the

numerical procedure can be found, e.g., in [29].

In the framework of the kinetic model introduced in section II A, the inﬂuence of IC

on the system evolution can be singled out by comparison with the solution of the corre-
sponding equations with Uii ≡
MD simulations, we have performed calculations propagating the ions in the mean-ﬁeld po-

0. In order to make an analogous comparison also for the

tential created by all charges. Technically, the mean-ﬁeld potential is represented using a

test-particle method, widely used for various problems in plasma physics (see, e.g., [30]).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We will discuss the evolution of a plasma initially consisting of Ne = 37500 electrons
and Ni = 40000 ions with an average density of 109 cm−3 at a rather low electronic kinetic

energy Ee = 3kBTe/2 = 20 K, comparing the results from the kinetic model and our MD

simulation. Thereby, we put special emphasis on the role of IC.

A. Global aspects of plasma expansion and recombination

The general macroscopic behavior of the system has been described before in several

publications, experimentally as well as theoretically [2, 3, 10, 11]. The plasma cloud slowly

expands due to the thermal pressure of the electrons, leading to adiabatic cooling of the

electrons as well as partial recombination into bound states (ﬁgures 1 and 2). The amount

of recombination and its inﬂuence strongly depends on the initial electron temperature and

density. If the electrons are too hot (about 50 K for typical experimental densities of 109
cm−3), recombination is strongly suppressed and the system dynamics is well described by

the results of [19] obtained for the collisionless plasma expansion [2].

FIG. 1: Electronic temperature Te(t) for an expanding plasma of 40000 ions with an initial

average density of 109cm−3 and an initial electron kinetic energy of 20 K, obtained from the H-MD

simulation (a) and the kinetic model (b), with (solid) and without (dotted) the inclusion of IC.

The inset shows the ratio of the electron temperatures obtained from the H-MD simulation and

the kinetic model.

1. Temporal evolution of the electronic temperature

For the lower electron temperatures considered here, as can be seen in Fig. 1, there is an

initial increase of the electron temperature due to electron heating by three-body recombi-

nation and subsequent deexcitation of the formed Rydberg atoms. At low initial electron

energies this heating drastically increases the electron temperature and thus accelerates the

plasma expansion [10], which explains the enhanced expansion velocity observed in [2]. In

contrast to this recombination heating of the electrons, the inclusion of IC only slightly

changes the expansion dynamics, as seen in Fig. 1 by comparing the solid and dotted lines.

As shown in the inset of Fig. 1a, the electron temperature obtained from the H-MD sim-

13

ulation and the kinetic model diﬀer by at most 8% during the ﬁrst few microseconds of

the plasma expansion, while the agreement becomes even better at later times. Moreover,

the faster decrease of the electron temperature due to the inclusion of IC, predicted by the

particle simulations, is quantitatively reproduced by the much simpler kinetic model.

Hence, the simple evolution equations (15) are suﬃcient to clarify the role of IC in

the expansion dynamics. According to Eq. (15c), the development of IC quickly heats

up the plasma ions to roughly

during this initial stage. Thereby, the negative correlation energy term 1

3Uii since the expansion of the plasma is still negligible
3Uii in Eq. (15b)
is overcompensated, leading to a faster expansion of the plasma. As a consequence of the

−

quicker expansion, the electron temperature decreases somewhat faster than without the

inclusion of IC. With Eq. (15b), the importance of this eﬀect can be estimated by comparing

the thermal electron energy kBTe to the net ion contribution

1
3 Uii in the numerator of the
ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (15b). Estimating the correlation energy by e2/a,

−

it follows that the total pressure driving the plasma expansion is enhanced by a factor of

roughly 1 + Γe/3, which only slightly changes the expansion dynamics since the electrons

are known to be weakly coupled over the whole observation time [10].

2. Formation of Rydberg atoms in time

The number of recombined atoms is inﬂuenced more strongly by IC (Fig. 2). During the

evolution of the system, Rydberg atoms are constantly formed by three-body recombination

and re-ionized by the free electrons in the plasma. As shown in Fig. 2a, for the current set

of parameters about 7000 Rydberg atoms are present in the system after 40 µs, while the

kinetic model yields about 7900 atoms at the same instant of time (Fig. 2b). This number

is small compared to the size of the whole system, nevertheless it is large enough that the

recombined atoms can be detected in an experiment, and corresponding curves have indeed

been obtained experimentally [3]. Due to the strong temperature dependence of the total
three-body recombination rate, which is proportional to T −9/2

[25], the slight decrease of

e

the electron temperature due to the faster expansion, caused by the correlation heating of

the ions, considerably aﬀects the recombination behavior of the plasma. While there is

an overall shift between the atom number obtained from the particle simulations and the

kinetic model, both the kinetic model and the H-MD simulation yield an increase of the

ion dynamics. Thus, the H-MD simulation corroborates our previous ﬁndings [13].

Additional insight into the recombination process can be gained from a closer look at the

distribution of bound Rydberg states. Figure 3 shows the population of levels with principal

quantum number n for three diﬀerent times, corresponding to diﬀerent stages of the plasma

expansion. Initially, Rydberg states of moderate excitation are populated, due to a relatively

high electron temperature (Fig. 3a). At later times, higher excited bound states are formed in

the course of the plasma expansion (Figs. 3b and 3c), since the maximum principal quantum

number for recombination nmax =

/(2kBTe) [25] increases as the electron temperature

drops down. Moreover, the deeply bound states formed at earlier times are also not subject

R

p

to electron-impact excitation and deexcitation anymore since the thermal velocity of the

impacting electrons has become too small. Thus, as becomes apparent by comparing Fig.
3b with 3c, the deeply bound states (n <

higher states “freeze out” as the plasma expands. As may be anticipated from Fig. 2, IC

mainly aﬀect the later stages of the plasma evolution. Hence, the inclusion of IC alters the

population of these higher lying states, as shown in Fig. 3c. Since these states have small

binding energy, they contribute little to the total kinetic energy of the plasma subsystem.

FIG. 4: Spatial densities ρi (solid) and ρa (dashed) of the ions and atoms, respectively, at t = 3 µs

Additionally, ρi obtained from the particle simulation using the mean-ﬁeld interaction only is shown

as the dot-dashed line in (a). Initial-state parameters are the same as in Fig. 1.

This is the reason why the eﬀect of IC is visible in the distribution of Rydberg states, but

not in the macroscopic expansion dynamics of the plasma, reﬂected, e.g., by the asymptotic

expansion velocity measured in [2].

B. Spatially resolved plasma expansion and relaxation

While the time evolution of global, i.e. space-averaged, observables of the plasma is very

well described by the kinetic model, one may expect discrepancies compared to the MD

simulations when looking into the spatially resolved plasma dynamics. We will assess these

discrepancies quantitatively in the following.

17

FIG. 5: Hydrodynamic velocity u(r) of ions (full circles) and atoms (open circles) at the same

times as in Fig. 4, compared to the straight-line assumption of the kinetic model. The dashed

line in (a) shows the result of the particle simulation using a mean-ﬁeld treatment of the ion-ion

interaction.

1. Evolution of the particle densities

In the derivation of the kinetic equations (15), we have assumed that the analytical form of

the ionic density ρi remains invariant during the evolution of the system and, moreover, that

the atoms will have the same distribution. As the plasma expands, the spatial proﬁle of the

ions must deviate from its original Gaussian shape [11]. This is mainly due to deviations from

quasineutrality, e.g. deviations from the linear space dependence of the outward directed

acceleration, at the plasma edge. The inﬂuence of the nonlinear correlation pressure on

the density proﬁle is of minor importance, as can be seen by comparing the solid and dot-

dashed line of Fig. 4a in the inner plasma region. As known from earlier studies of expanding

plasmas, based on a mean-ﬁeld treatment of the particle interactions [11, 31, 32], a sharp

spike develops at the plasma edge, shown by the dot-dashed line in Fig. 4a. At later times,

18

this spike decays again when the maximum of the hydrodynamic ion velocity passes the

position of the density peak, so that the region of the peak is depleted. Ultimately, at

long times, the plasma approaches a quasineutral selfsimilar expansion [32]. From Fig. 4a

it becomes apparent that with IC the peak structure is less pronounced than in mean-ﬁeld

approximation. This is due to dissipation caused by ion-ion collisions which are fully taken

into account in the H-MD simulation. As shown in [32], by adding an ion viscosity term

to the hydrodynamic equations of motion, dissipation tends to stabilize the ion density

and prevents the occurrence of wavebreaking which was found to be responsible for the

diverging ion density at the plasma edge in the case of a dissipationless plasma expansion.

Furthermore, the initial correlation heating of the ions largely increases the thermal ion

velocities leading to a broadening of the peak structure compared to the zero-temperature

case.

Apart from the deviations at the plasma edge, the ionic density is rather well reproduced

by the Gaussian approximation for the spatial distribution.

In particular, there is good

agreement between the rms-radii obtained from the MD simulation and the kinetic model.

On the other hand, the spatial distribution of atoms signiﬁcantly deviates from that of the

ions even at relatively early times due to the nonlinear density dependence of the collision

rates in Eq. (20). However, as also stated in [11], the total number of atoms is too small to

signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the macroscopic expansion of the system.

2. Spatial dependence of the radial velocities

Another assumption used in the derivation of the kinetic model is the proportionality

of the hydrodynamical expansion velocity to the distance from the center of the plasma

cloud, u = γr, both for the ions and the atoms. In order to check this assumption, we have

calculated the radial velocity component vr = vr/r of each particle, which is plotted as a

function of the radial distance from the plasma center in Fig. 5. At an early time the velocity

distribution is spread out about its mean value predicted from the kinetic approach due to

the ﬁnite ionic temperature. Note that the expansion is slower near the plasma edge due to

the deviation from quasineutrality as discussed above. Consequently, the inner part of the

plasma which expands more quickly will catch up with the outer rim, leading to the formation

of the density spike seen in Fig. 4a. In the case of the H-MD simulation the velocity spread,

caused by the initial ion heating, is of the same order of magnitude as the hydrodynamical

expansion velocity itself, leading to a signiﬁcant broadening of the density spike as discussed

above. At later stages of the system evolution, the ions cool adiabatically due to the plasma

expansion, and the width of the velocity distribution decreases signiﬁcantly. Moreover, as

discussed in connection with the decay of the ion density peak in Fig. 4b, the decrease of

the ion velocities near the plasma edge apparent at early times has disappeared.

A comparison with the result of the kinetic model equations (15) shows once more that the

H-MD simulation not only reproduces the linear radial dependence of the hydrodynamical

velocity, but also yields a quantitative agreement between both methods.

3. Spatial dependence of the thermal velocities

Due to its marginal inﬂuence on the plasma expansion dynamics, the role of the ionic

temperature Ti for the state of the system has not been addressed before. In the cold ﬂuid

model of [10, 11], Ti has been set to zero in order to follow the long-time plasma dynamics.

However, as stated in the introduction, one of the motivations of the current type of exper-

iments was the creation of a strongly coupled plasma. In this context, knowledge of Ti is

essential since it directly enters the Coulomb coupling parameter which determines the state

of the plasma. Moreover, the ionic temperature gives important insight into the relaxation

dynamics of the plasma. For comparing the kinetic model with the H-MD calculations, the

very deﬁnition of Ti for the MD simulation requires some discussion. As discussed in section

II, we assume a Gaussian velocity distribution, i.e. a well-deﬁned temperature Ti, for the

plasma ions in our kinetic model. This, of course, is an approximation since the plasma is

not created in an equilibrium state. The total kinetic energy of the ions is a sum of the

hydrodynamical expansion energy and a contribution due to the thermal motion of the ions.

Since the hydrodynamical velocity is directed radially (Eq. (14)), we determine the thermal

energy of the ions from the average of the velocity component perpendicular to the radial

direction

Clearly, such an assignment of a temperature to the average velocity is only well deﬁned if

the ion velocities v⊥ are distributed according to a Maxwell distribution. In order to check

the validity of this requirement, we have sampled the ion velocity distribution v⊥ from three

diﬀerent regions in the plasma: r

in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Additionally, we have ﬁtted a Maxwell-Boltzmann

distribution to the numerical results, formally deﬁning a temperature in the corresponding

plasma region. As can be seen in Fig. 6, even at the very early stage of the plasma evolution

the numerical data is well ﬁtted by an equilibrium distribution in the inner plasma region,

while there are deviations in the outer region of the plasma since the relaxation time is longer

due to the lower density far away from the plasma center. However, already after a relatively

short time of t = 1.5 µs the velocity distributions are well ﬁtted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann

distribution in all three plasma regions (Fig. 7). Hence, the ion thermal energy can be

represented by a local temperature Ti(r), decreasing with growing distance from the plasma

center as can be seen from Figs. 6 and 7. This is due to the fact that the initial heating

arises from a compensation of the negative correlation energy, which is larger in the central

plasma region where the density is higher. However, as becomes apparent by comparing

Figs. 6 and 7, the thermal energy equilibrates over the whole plasma volume rather quickly

as the system evolves. While the temperatures deﬁned in the inner and outermost region

deviate by a factor of eight at t = 0.3 µs, they diﬀer by a factor of two only 1.2 µs later.

Figure 8 gives a more detailed account of this equilibration process. Here, the local ionic

temperature is plotted as a function of the radial distance from the plasma center at four

diﬀerent times, where Ti(r) has been deﬁned from the velocity average of a shell of 2000

ions with a central shell radius r. The temperature decrease with increasing distance from

the center as discussed above is clearly visible. Nevertheless, the ion temperature is seen

to equilibrate rather quickly, so that the approximation of a homogeneous ion temperature,

used in the derivation of the kinetic model in section II A, becomes better and better at later

times. Moreover, the numerically calculated distribution of thermal velocities sampled over

the whole plasma volume is well represented by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with some

average temperature intermediate between the temperatures of the inner and outer region,

22

respectively (Fig. 7d). This shows that the Gaussian phase-space distribution assumed for

the ions in section II A agrees very well with the results of the MD simulation averaged over

the spatial coordinates, even if the temperature still shows substantial inhomogeneities.

C. Spatially averaged ionic observables

As we have demonstrated in section III A the kinetic model describes the global temporal

evolution of the plasma including recombination quite accurately. From the detailed anal-

ysis of the spatially resolved plasma dynamics in the previous subsection we may expect

that the kinetic model describes spatially averaged observables, such as the kinetic energy

of the expansion, the thermal energy, and the correlation energy of the plasma quite well.

This is indeed the case over almost the entire evolution time as Fig. 9 demonstrates for

the correlation energy and the thermal ion energy. Only at an early stage of the plasma

evolution, diﬀerences between MD simulation and kinetic model are visible, showing that

the correlation-time approximation Eq. (17) does not accurately describe this early phase

of equilibration starting from a completely uncorrelated state in all details. Since the initial

state is very far from equilibrium, the initial relaxation process is not exponential, as as-

sumed in the correlation-time approximation Eq. (17). Rather, it is connected with transient

oscillations of the temperature (inset of Fig. 9) which have been found both theoretically

[18, 33, 34] and experimentally [35]. However, the timescale of the initial ion heating as well

as the maximum temperature are well reproduced by the simple model. After the system has

come suﬃciently close to local equilibrium, the quality of the correlation-time approxima-

tion becomes better and, once again, close agreement between the two approaches is found,

supporting our argument put forward in the derivation of the kinetic approach in section II.

At later times diﬀerences become apparent, which may be attributed to the fact that the

ion relaxation is considerably disturbed by recombination and ionization events leading to

sudden local changes of the charge density, which is not taken into account by the kinetic

model.

Furthermore, according to both approaches, the correlation energy and the thermal ki-

netic energy of the ions are almost identical roughly to the time where both curves reach

their maximum values, showing that the total correlation energy is completely converted

into thermal kinetic energy of the ions, as expressed by Eq. (15c). At later times, this addi-

tional kinetic energy is transferred to the outward directed motion of the ions, leading to an

indirect enhancement of the plasma expansion by the development of IC and to adiabatic

cooling of the ions. Therefore, the thermal ion kinetic energy starts to deviate from the

correlation energy as the plasma expansion sets in.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have presented two diﬀerent theoretical approaches for the simulation of

ultracold neutral plasmas. First, we have introduced a simple kinetic model along the lines of

[10], and we have shown how to include a description of IC into the model in an approximate

way. Moreover, we have developed a hybrid molecular dynamics approach which allows for

an accurate description of the strongly coupled ion motion on microsecond timescales, by

treating the electronic component as a ﬂuid using an adiabatic approximation while the ions

are fully accounted for on an MD level.

Supporting our results from [13], both methods show that the inclusion of IC enhances

the number of recombined Rydberg atoms by a few percent, but only slightly aﬀects the

macroscopic expansion dynamics of the plasma itself. As we have shown, this is due to the

fact that mainly the population of very highly excited states is increased if IC are taken

into account, which have a small binding energy and therefore hardly inﬂuence the electron

24

temperature.

By comparison of the two methods, we could show that the simple kinetic description

adequately describes the evolution of global, i.e. spatially averaged, plasma observables.

Thus, the kinetic model, which allows for a much faster computation, may be used to

quickly and eﬃciently scan the vast space of initial-state parameters, e.g. in order to obtain

a “phase diagram” for Rydberg gas / plasma systems [36]. Moreover, it permits extending

the description of ultracold plasmas to a parameter range where the plasma is so large
that the number of particles (Ni >
∼

106) prohibits an MD simulation. Maybe even more

importantly, the simple kinetic equations give additional insight into the dynamics beyond

that possible on the basis of MD simulations by providing simple evolution equations for

the macroscopic parameters describing the plasma state.

On the other hand, spatially resolved quantities such as ionic density, ion velocities or

local temperature show deviations from the behavior predicted by the simple kinetic model.

However, the developed H-MD approach provides a powerful method for the study of these

quantities, and for the detailed description of the relaxation dynamics of the strongly coupled

ions on a microsecond timescale. Moreover, it permits the study of scenarios where the ions

are so strongly coupled that Coulomb crystallization occurs [16], which cannot be described

by the kinetic model.

that the space dependence of the correlation function enters only via the densities at the

which follows from the symmetry of gii under particle exchange, i.e., under exchange of ρi
and ρ′

i. Since the integrand of the ﬁrst integral in Eq. (A6) is an odd function in x the ﬁrst

term vanishes. The second term yields after some manipulations

Finally, substitution of the deﬁnition of the correlation energy u as given by Eq. (13) yields

the result Eq. (12). An analogous calculation for the expression of the correlation energy

Eq. (9) leads to the familiar LDA result [37]

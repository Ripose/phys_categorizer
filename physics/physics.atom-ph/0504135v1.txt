Correlated Gaussian method for dilute bosonic systems

Abstract. The weakly interacting trapped Bose gases have been customarily described using the mean-ﬁeld approximation
in the form of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The mean-ﬁeld approximation, however, has certain limitations, in particular it
can not describe correlations between particles. We introduce here an alternative variational approach, based on the correlated
Gaussian method, which in its simplest form is as fast and simple as the mean-ﬁeld approximation, but which allows successive
improvements of the trial wave-function by including correlations between particles.

INTRODUCTION

Dilute Bose systems trapped in external ﬁelds have been a rapidly developing ﬁeld since the Bose-Einstein conden-
sation was observed almost a decade ago. Theoretically the mean-ﬁeld approach in the form of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation [1] has been widely and successfully applied to these systems. The computational complexity of the method,
and thus the computational time, is independent of the number of particles N, in other words it is of the order of
O(1).Therefore the method can be applied for large (mesoscopic) bosonic systems, especially when combined with a
pseudo-potential (in the form of the d -function potential) approximation for the interaction potential between particles.
However, the mean-ﬁeld method has certain limitations, in particular it cannot be easily extended to include
correlations between particles. Correlations become important for systems with higher densities and/or stronger
effective interactions. Such strong interacting regimes, where the mean-ﬁeld theory breaks down [2], are now routinely
achieved experimentally by use of Feshbach resonances.

Rigorous many-body methods, like the diffusion Monte-Carlo method [2, 3], which include all correlations, has
computational complexity of the order O(N2) and therefore can only be applied for smaller systems. Again, for
relatively dilute gases only few simple types of correlation are expected to be important, and including the full
machinery of rigorous few-body methods is perhaps by far an overkill for these systems.

Recently, several methods with computational complexity O(1) have been proposed for ﬁnite-range [4, 6], and zero-
range [7] interactions, where the trial wave-function can incorporate two-body correlations. However, these methods
can not be easily extended to include higher order correlations.

We introduce here yet another approach which has an important advantage over the existing methods. Namely the
approach can incorporate any desired number and type of correlations – from an uncorrelated wave-function with
computational complexity of O(1) at one end, to fully correlated wave-function with computational complexity of
O(N2) and higher at the other end. Thus, depending upon the problem at hand one has a possibility to negotiate a
reasonable trade off between the sophistication of the trial wave-function and the computational time.

For dilute gases only few types of lowest order correlations should be of importance, and it turns out that for these

types of correlations the method is yet of O(1) order of complexity.

The method is based on correlated Gaussians and amount to a judicious choice of the nonlinear parameters of the

basis Gaussians.

The Jacobian of the transformation from r to the scaled coordinates q is equal to

If all particles have the same mass m, there is no difference between coordinates r and q.
One can make a further suitable linear transformation to a new set of coordinates,

or, in matrix notation x = Uq, where the matrix U is independent of q. The new system of coordinates is called Jacobi if
i mi
i) one of the coordinates, say the Nth, is proportional to the center of mass coordinate R of the system, xN =
m R;
ii) the other N − 1 coordinates are translation invariant; and iii) the transformation preserves the “diagonal” form (3)
of the kinetic energy operator.

q

The last property implies that the transformation (5) and also any transformation between different Jacobi coordi-
nates is unitary, UU T = 1 (where T denotes transposition), with the corresponding Jacobian being equal to unity. The
unitarity means that the so-called hyper-radius r , deﬁned as r 2 ≡ (cid:229) q2

i , is invariant under these transformations,

With Jacobi coordinates the center of mass coordinate decouples and the hyper-radius it therefore often deﬁned

without the contribution from the center of mass coordinate xN,

One of the possible choices of the Jacobi coordinates is

where Ri is the coordinate of the center of mass of the ﬁrst i particles, rN+1 ≡ 0, and m i is the reduced mass

Hyper-radial approximation

Non-interacting bosons in a harmonic trap

Let us consider a system of non-interacting bosons in a harmonic trap. This should be a good ﬁrst approximation to

a system of weakly interacting bosons in a trap which is smooth at the bottom and spherically symmetric.

is thus an exact solution for a system of non-interacting bosons in a harmonic trap.
Generally speaking a function of hyper-radius will provide an exact solution to the many-body system in cases where
the potential energy of the system depends only on the hyper-radius. The harmonic trap is precisely this type of
potential.

Weakly interacting bosons

If the particles in the trap interact only weakly one can assume, following the ideas from the mean-ﬁeld theory,
that the inter-particle interactions will effectively lead to a certain modiﬁcation of the ﬁeld. The solution will then be
some square-integrable function of hyper-radius, F HR(r ), which can be represented as a linear combination of, say, n
Gaussians,

F HR(r ) =

where Cs are variational parameters, and the range parameters a s (s = 1..n) are assumed to be ﬁxed and chosen to
span the necessary functional space. This trial wave-function is called a hyper-radial approximation. In practice the
parameters a s are chosen and then optimized in a stochastic procedure using the ideas from the stochastic variational
method [9].

The variational mean-ﬁeld approach is based on an assumption that a product wave-function can provide a good
,

description of an interacting system. The trial wave-function Y MF is taken as a product of single-particle functions y

where the functional form of y (q) is varied to reach the minimum of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.
Assuming that y

is a square integrable function, one can represent it as a linear combination of Gaussians,

where the coefﬁcients cs are the variational parameters. The trial mean-ﬁeld wave-function then becomes

which should be compared with the hyper-radial trial wave-function

results.

Both functions are totally symmetric and thus do not require an explicit symmetrization. The computational time

for the variational minimization of the Hamiltonian with both functions is independent of the number of particles.

The hyper-radial function has an advantage that the center of mass motion can be easily decoupled by a (unitary)
transformation to relative Jacobi coordinates. Again, the mean-ﬁeld function cannot be easily improved, while the
hyper-radial function is only the basis for further improvements.

The basis function is no longer automatically symmetric over all permutations. It has to be symmetrized with respect
to particles number 1 and 2 and therefore the symmetrization operator, ˆS, has to be included when calculating matrix
elements,

This is the same type of Faddeev-like decomposition of the wave-function as used in [4, 7, 8].

Fortunately, only a ﬁnite number of different terms appear in calculations of the matrix elements, and the compu-
tational time is therefore still independent of the number of particles. Indeed the kinetic energy and the external ﬁeld
operators are fully symmetric and therefore the explicit symmetrization of the wave-function is not needed for their
matrix elements. The matrix element for the inter-particle potentials reduces to a ﬁnite number of terms,

Each individual matrix element in this expression is readily calculated using the expression (28) in the appendix. The

This function must be explicitly symmetrized with respect to particles 1, 2, and 3. This symmetrization again results
in a ﬁnite number of different terms as it did for two-body correlations. There are in total 34 different terms and it is
therefore not practical to write them down here. The computer program can easily catch the identical terms and thus
reduce the computational complexity down to the order of O(1), that is, independent of the number of particles.

NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATIONS

The Bose system

We use 87Rb condensate parameters corresponding to ﬁxed scattering length as = 100 a.u. and trapping frequency
w = 2p × 77.87 Hz, and vary the number of atoms N = 101 − 104. In all cases, the inverse square root of the nonlinear
parameters b k and g k are optimized from the random value interval [10−4bt ; 10bt] (where bt =
¯h/(mw ) ≈ 23095 a.u.
is the trap length), while for the parameters a
the interval was [bt; 103bt]. In practice only one parameter a 0 was needed
to achieve the chosen accuracy goal of three digits on the interaction energy per particle.

p

The mean-ﬁeld validity condition, na3

s ≪ 1, where n is the particle density, is fulﬁlled for all values of N. Therefore
the Gross-Pitaevskii results from the literature should be quite accurate and we shall use them as the reference point.
The other regime, na3

s ≫ 1, shall be investigated separately.

Two-body potentials

We consider only dilute bosonic systems where the properties largely depend upon the low-energy/large-distance
properties of the two-body interaction, that is the s-wave scattering length as. In this regime a zero-range pseudo-
potential given by a delta function,

is proven to provide within a mean-ﬁeld theory a good approximation to the energy of the system. Applying the
delta-function interaction with a Hilbert space of a beyond-mean-ﬁeld theory, however, requires an appropriate
renormalization [7]. The physical scattering length in (23) should be substituted by its ﬁrst-order Born approximation
of the given ﬁnite-range potential.

We shall use the delta-function potential for calculation with the uncorrelated hyper-radial trial wave-function.
For correlated calculations we shall use four different ﬁnite-range potentials of the form

where the parameters of the potentials are speciﬁed in Table 1. The ﬁrst potential, marked H, is a hard repulsive core,
the second, S, is a soft repulsive core, the third, A, is an attractive well, and the fourth, W, is a semi-realistic well with
a repulsive core and an attractive pocket. All potentials have the same scattering length, as = 100 a.u., and in the dilute
regime should therefore provide identical energies if correlations are appropriately included.

Results

The results are collected in Tables 2 and 3, where we show the interaction energy per particle, E

(where E is
the total energy of the system), for different combinations of numbers of particles, potentials, and trial wave-functions.
The absence of a number for the attractive and realistic potential means that there are many strongly bound (collapsed)
states and an analog of the condensate state located in the trap does not exist.

Uncorrelated wave-function

The results for different potentials with the uncorrelated hyper-radial trial wave-function are given in Tables 2-3 and

also represented on Fig.1.

Importantly, the combination of delta-function pseudo-potential with the uncorrelated hyper-radial wave-function
give results within a few per cent of the mean-ﬁeld theory. The pseudo-potential therefore seems to be equally well
suited for both mean-ﬁeld and hyper-radial approximations.

One can use this very fast uncorrelated pseudo-potential approximation to a great effect as a tool to optimize the

parameters of the Gaussians to be used in the more demanding correlated calculations with ﬁnite-range potentials.

The ﬁnite-range potentials show large deviations since the uncorrelated wave-function is not suited for them. The
hard-core potential, as could be expected, is especially bad for the uncorrelated wave-function. The attractive potential
produces for larger number of particles a strongly bound (collapsed) ground-state and is therefore not shown on the
ﬁgure.

Two-body correlations

The results with the two-body correlated trial wave-function are given in Tables 2-3 and also represented on Fig. 2.
Apparently, inclusion of two-body correlations dramatically improves the results. This seems to support the assertion

in [4, 7, 8] that the two-body correlations are of the utmost importance for the dilute gases.

The hard-core potential, although doing much better with the two-body correlated wave-function, is still the farthest
off especially for large number of particles. The soft-core potential on the other hand is now very close to the mean-
ﬁeld results.

Three-body correlations

We do not show a separate ﬁgure for the three-body correlations as they turn out not to produce large effects on the
energies apart from potentials with attraction, where the three-body correlations quite expectedly straight away lead to
a large number of strongly bound (collapsed) states.

Thus, for model repulsive ﬁnite-range potentials and dilute systems the three-body correlations are of much less

importance that two-body correlations.

Interaction energy per particle as function of the number of particles N for the trial wave-function with two-body

CONCLUSION

We have introduced a new approach, based on correlated Gaussian method, to investigate dilute Bose systems. The
approach allows to include consecutively correlations of different orders in the trial wave-function. In its lowest
(uncorrelated) order with zero-range pseudo-potentials the approach is comparable to the mean-ﬁeld (Gross-Pitaevskii)
theory.

We have performed an exploratory numerical investigation of two- and three-body correlation in a dilute Bose
system with different number of particles and different ﬁnite-range potentials. For the condensate state the two-body
correlations turn out to be by far the most important and sufﬁce to provide a quantitative description of the system with
soft-core potentials.

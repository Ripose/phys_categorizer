The electron transfer between an F − ion and Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces is studied by

the wave packet propagation method in order to determine speciﬁcs of the charge transfer

interaction between the negative ion and the metal surface due to the projected band gap. A

new modeling of the F − ion is developed that allows one to take into account the six quasi-

equivalent electrons of F − which are a priori active in the charge transfer process. The

new model invokes methods of constrained quantum dynamics. The six-electron problem is

transformed to two one-electron problems linked via a constraint. The projection method

is used to develop a wave packet propagation subject to the modeling constraint. The

characteristics (energy and width) of the ion F − ion level interacting with the two surfaces

are determined and discussed in connection with the surface projected band gap.

I. INTRODUCTION

When an atom or a molecule is close to a surface of a solid, its electrons interact with those

of the solid, leading to the possibility of an electron transfer between the atom (molecule)

and the solid. This charge transfer process plays a very important role in a variety of

diﬀerent situations. In particular, it often occurs as an intermediate step in reactions at sur-

faces (desorption, fragmentation of adsorbates, chemical reactions, quenching of metastable

species, etc.) [1–4]. The one-electron transfer between energetically degenerate electronic

levels of the atom and the solid is called the Resonant Charge Transfer (RCT) process.

It is usually considered as the most eﬃcient one among various possible charge transfer

interactions. Since a few years the development of accurate theoretical approaches to the

RCT in the case of free electron metal surfaces [5–11] has led to a successful description

of a one-electron transfer in the interaction of ions (atoms) with such surfaces [12–14]. All

these approaches are based on the description of single electron being transferred between

the atom and the surface. As an example, one can mention the neutralisation of an alkali

positive ion by RCT, even if the possibility of capturing the electron in two diﬀerent spin

states somewhat alters the one-electron picture [15,16]. However, many atoms or molecules

contain more than one electron which can possibly participate in the charge transfer pro-

cess, especially, when the active electrons occupy the same energy level. The latter has to

be taken into account in any quantitative approach to the RCT [12–17].

For instance, a free ﬂuorine negative ion can be described as a closed 2p6 outer electronic

shell with six equivalent electrons, and all of them can participate in the RCT when the ion

is close to a metal surface. The eﬀects of each electron cannot be simply added up to get

a total eﬀect. Indeed, consider the loss of an electron by the ion. Any of the six electrons

can be the one that is detached. However, the detachment of one electron a priori precludes

the detachment of another one. Clearly, the loss of a second electron would be a completely

diﬀerent process because it corresponds to a formation of a positive ﬂuorine ion and, hence,

has a diﬀerent energetics. Such correlations between the outer-shell electrons of the F −

2

ion must be accounted for in any description of the RCT. In this work we show how such

correlations can be modeled by two one-electron systems linked via a constraint.

In classical dynamics, constraints appear as some algebraic relations between generalized

coordinates of a system and their time derivatives (velocities), which are to hold for any mo-

ment of time. They are widely used to model, e.g., eﬀects of an environment on a system

in question, or to develop theories with local symmetries (gauge theories) such as electro-

dynamics, general relativity and Yang-Mills theories. Classical constrained dynamics has

been well studied in classical works by d’Alambert, Lagrange, H¨older and Gauss (see, e.g.,

Ref. [18] and references therein). In quantum mechanics constraints have been analyzed by

Dirac [19], mainly because of the need of quantizing fundamental physical theories with local

symmetries. The question addressed by Dirac was the following: Given a classical system

with constraints, construct a quantum theory which satisﬁes the correspondence principle. A

time evolution of a quantum system is described by the evolution operator. Its kernel in

the coordinate representation is called a quantum mechanical propagator. For constrained

systems it is usually obtained by a reduction of the Feynman phase space path integral onto

the physical phase space, as proposed by Faddeev [20]. There are many subtleties associated

with quantization of constrained systems (see for a review, e.g., [21]).

Here we propose a quantum constrained system which can be used to model the charge

transfer interaction between an F − ion and a metal surface. The basic idea is to transform

the original six-electron problem to two one-electron problems each of which describes a

possible decay channel of the ion. As a consequence of the quantum equivalence of the

outer-shell electrons, the eﬀective one-electron systems turn out to be linked only by a

constraint. In other words, the entire interaction between the two systems occurs through a

constraint rather than via a local potential. One can also say that such a kinematic coupling

of the decay channels is induced by the symmerty of the original six-electron problem.

The constraint has a remarkable feature: It does not have a classical limit, meaning

that its eﬀects disappear in the formal classical limit ¯h

0. That is, the dynamical eﬀect

modeled by such a constraint is essentially quantum and cannot be modeled by any classical

→

3

potential force. In this regard, the canonical quantization scheme for constrained systems

due to Dirac is not applicable here. We develop below a novel computational scheme for

a quantum evolution subject to such purely quantum constraints. The scheme is based

on the projection formalism introduced earlier by one of us [22] within the framework of

gauge theories. Our approach also comprises a novel method to account for the intra-atomic

correlations within a one-electron description of the charge transfer interaction between an

F − ion and the Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. We demonstrate that the approach turns

out to be very eﬃcient in the wave packet propagation studies.

The choice of the F −/Cu(111) and F −/Ag(111) systems is motivated by several reasons.

The interaction of halogen negative ions with a free-electron metal surface has already been

studied theoretically within the Coupled Angular Mode approach which lead to a quite

satisfactory description of the halogen negative ion formation in scattering halogen atoms

by various metal surfaces [12,13]. Recently, on the example of the Cu(111) surface it has

been shown that the projected band gap of the (111) surfaces of noble metals strongly aﬀects

the RCT [23,24]. The point is that in a certain energy range electrons cannot propagate

along the normal to the surface (L-band gap in the < 111 > direction [25]). On the other

hand, the RCT process corresponds to an electron tunneling between the atom and the

surface which is favored along the surface normal. In addition, it was shown that the 2D

electronic continuum of the surface state plays a signiﬁcant role, often dominating the RCT

process. The band gap has several consequences. First, there exist very long lived states in

the alkali–Cu(111) systems [24,26,27]. Second, there is a parallel velocity dependence of the

probability of an electron capture by the atom from Cu(111) surfaces in grazing scattering

experiments that is characteristic of a 2D electronic continuum [28]. Third, there exits an

avoided crossing between the energy level of the projectile and the bottom of the surface

state continuum [23]. These eﬀects have been found to depend strongly on the interaction

time [23,29,30]: They only appear for long interaction times, i.e., for slow collisions.

The free F − ion energy level is slightly above the bottom of the surface state continuum

of the Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces, and therefore, because of the image charge attraction,

4

it could cross the bottom of the 2D continuum for a ﬁnite ion-surface distance. In the present

work, we investigate the eﬀects of the projected band gap and of the surface state continuum

on the F −-metal charge transfer. In particular, we study the behavior of the system when

the ion energy level is very close to the bottom of the 2D surface state continuum. A Wave

Packet Propagation (WPP) approach to the RCT [8,23] provides a quantitative description

of dynamic and static aspects of the F −-surface charge transfer. The latter allows one to

analyze the dependence of the band structure eﬀect upon an interaction time in the RCT.

II. METHOD

A. A negative ion F −

The free negative ion F − is usually described in the Hartree–Fock approximation as a

closed shell ion with the electronic conﬁguration 1s22s22p6. Its binding energy is 3.4 eV. In

this approach the outer shell electrons are regarded as equivalent. Their wave function is

given by the corresponding Slater determinant

Φ =

(cid:12)

where 2p symbolizes a 2p orbital wave function, the superscripts α and β stand for the

two possible spin directions, and the subscript indicates the magnetic quantum number m

corresponding to the projection of the 2p angular momentum on the quantization axis. The

Slater determinant (1) can be expanded into a sum of products of wave functions of an ionic

core and an outer electron:

where the ﬁve-electron determinant

product Ajφj corresponds to the 2pα,β

describes a state of the ﬂuorine atom F (2P ). The

Fj|
|
m orbital, which has been factorised into a spin factor

Aj and a spatial wave function φj = φj(~r ). The wave function (2) can also be used for

an open shell description of the negative ion of the type 2p52p′. In this case, the spatial

5

wave function φj singled out in (2) corresponds to the outer 2p′ orbital of the negative ion,

whereas the core wave function

is formed by the inner 2p orbitals. When analyzing the

Gj|

|

electron detachment process in the open shell description, the 2p′ orbital is regarded as an

active one.

The representation (2) is particularly well suited for an analysis of the electron cap-

ture/loss process between a ﬂuorine ion F − and a metal surface since it gives an expansion

of the ion wave function over possible detachment channels. So, we retain the representation

(2) to describe a loss or capture of an electron by the ﬂuorine core

Ψ =

Gj |

|

ψj .

Xj

(3)

Here ψj = ψj(~r ) is a wave function of an electron (captured or lost) in the j-channel. Ne-

glecting the spin-orbit interactions and assuming the ion-surface interaction to be invariant

under translations of the ion parallel to the surface, the system becomes invariant under

the spin ﬂip and rotations about the z-axis which is set to be perpendicular to the metal

surface and passing through the ion center. Next, the z-axis is chosen as the quantization

axis. Therefore the states with the z-component of the electron angular momentum

1 are

degenerate. As a consequence, only two electron wave functions are distinct in the repre-

sentation (3). They correspond to the states with m = 0 and

= 1. In what follows we

m
|

|

assume that the charge transfer does not aﬀect the neutral core wave function

. Only

±

Gj|

|

the outer electron is subject to the RCT dynamics.

Any state of the system can be represented as a two dimensional isovector

Ψ

whose

components are one-electron states corresponding to m = 0 and

elements of the isovector, respectively). In cylindrical coordinates (z, ρ, ϕ), it can be written

(4)

Note that, due to the symmetry of the problem, the ϕ dependence can be explicitly given.

Hence, one can limit oneself to studying the z- and ρ-dependence of the electron wave packet.

(5)

where p(r) is the radial part of the free-ion orbital and Ylm(θ, ϕ) are the spherical harmonics.

The diﬀerent normalization factors of the isovector components are due to the fact that the

free ion wave function (2) contains twice as many states with

= 1 as with m = 0. The

functions p(r)Ylm(θ, ϕ) have a unit norm so that

ΨF −

Yet another remark is that the approach outlined above assumes that only an outer

|
|

electron can be detached (the detachment occurs through the evolution of the wave functions

ψ0 and ψ1), i.e., it assumes an open shell description (2p52p′) of the ion F −. A closed shell

description (2p6) would correspond to an increase of the charge transfer interaction by the

factor √6, and, hence, to an increase of the width by the factor 6 (see a discussion in [16]).

This appears to be better adapted for the halogen negative ion case.

With all the above settings, a modeling of the charge transfer in the F −-metal system

implies ﬁnding a one-electron Hamiltonian that governs a time evolution in the Hilbert space

spanned by vectors (4). We take it in the following form

H = T + Vat + VS = Hat + VS .

(6)

The operators H, T, Vat, VS and Hat are diagonal 2

2 matrices, in fact, we choose them

×

to be proportional to a unit 2

2 matrix, with the diagonal elements denoted, respectively,

×

H, T, Vat, VS and Hat. Here, T is the electron kinetic energy operator, Vat the potential of

the interaction between an electron and the neutral core, VS the potential of the electron-

surface interaction, Hat = T + Vat, and H = Hat + VS. The wave functions p(r)Ylm(θ, ϕ) are

eigenfunctions of the one-electron Hamiltonian Hat.

The time evolution of the wave function (4) generated by the Hamiltonian (6) is nothing

but the evolution of two independent one-electron wave packets. On the other hand, the two

components of the isovector (4) cannot evolve independently. Indeed, in the free ion case, the

two components cannot be arbitrarily chosen in order for the state (4) to describe a physical

7

free ion. Actually, the radial components of the column elements appear to be proportional

to each other with a speciﬁc factor (cf. (5)). This relation between the two components

comes from the expansion of the Slater determinant (1) which possesses a high symmetry

being the symmetry of a quantum system of identical particles occupying the same energy

level. The very same symmetry must be preserved in the expansion (2) and, hence, upon

a reduction of the six-electron description to our one-electron formalism. In other words,

there must be a correlation between evolving components of the isovector corresponding to

the electron states with m = 0 and

= 1 thanks to the symmetry of the six-electron

m
|

|

problem. Therefore physically admissible states in the Hilbert space spanned by isovectors

(4) must be subject to some constraints required by the symmetry of the original six-electron

problem. This will be a key point of our new approach to the RCT dynamics.

To illustrate the necessity of constraints, consider the case when the detachment occurs

in the m = 0 channel. Then the bound part of the

= 1 channel must also disappear at

m
|

|

the same time because there is only one ion F − which contains both m = 0 and

= 1

m
|

|

components.

In the Eﬀective Range approach [31] used in the Coupled Angular Mode

(CAM) method [6], this problem has been solved in the following way. One only considers

the wave function of the system given by expression (4) outside a spherical region of radius

rc. The F core is contained in the region. The boundary condition on the radial components

ψ0 and ψ1 at r = rc couples the two channels. This approach essentially relies on the use of

spherical coordinates. Here we look for a coordinate independent description of the channel

mixing that can be eﬃciently implemented in numerical calculations of the time evolution of

the system (wave packet propagation). The origin of the kinematic coupling of the channels

is now sought in symmetries of the system. It is believed that such an approach is rather

general and could be applied to other many-electron systems where a conventional mean

ﬁeld approach does not provide a good approximation.

The basic idea is that the Hilbert space spanned by isovectors (4) is too large and contains

states which are physically not acceptable. It is clearly seen already from the fact that the

radial components of the free ion state (5) are not independent. We shall then constrain the

8

state (4) to allow only one bound ion F − of the form (5). Any other state with components

p(r)Y10(θ, ϕ) and ψ1 ∼
ψ0 ∼
the state (4) orthogonal to the vector

p(r)Y11(θ, ϕ) should be forbidden. This corresponds to making

Since the state (7) cannot also occur as a virtual (or intermediate) state of the ion in the

time evolution of the system, we demand that the time dependent wave packet (4) must be

orthogonal to the vector

stands for a standard scalar product (written in cylindrical

coordinates because the functions p0,1 and ψ0,1 depend on z and ρ only).

From the physical point of view the constraint (8) simply means that there is an unwanted

scattering mode in our eﬀective one-electron problem. Although the Hamiltonian may allow

for such a mode, we have given physical reasons to forbid it. The constraint (8) implies

that the time evolution of the two components of the isovector (4) is no longer independent

even though the Hamiltonian (6) does not provide any direct coupling of them. The link

between the detachment channels with m = 0 and

= 1 steams directly from the free ion

|

structure. It implicitly assumes that the correlation between the wave functions ψ0 and ψ1

in the ion perturbed by an interaction with a metal surface is the same as in the free ion.

Thus, the electronic structure of F − has been modeled by two one-electron problems linked

by the constraint (8).

B. Physical Hamiltonian

Now we face a problem of incorporating the constraint into quantum dynamics gener-

ated by the Hamiltonian (6). The diﬃculty is clear. Suppose an initial state satisﬁes the

constraint (8). Applying the evolution operator exp(

itH) to it, we immediately observe

−

9

that the evolved state fails to satisfy the constraint. The procedure we propose is based on

the projection operator formalism ﬁrst introduced for gauge theories [22,32]. It has been

generalized to general constrained systems [33,34] (see also the review [21]). The key steps

are as follows.

Consider the projection operator

P = I

operator (9) is self-adjoint, P† = P, and satisﬁes the characteristic property of a projection

operator, P2 = P. By construction, the state P

(10)

The physical Hamiltonian (10) is self-adjoint. Hence the time evolution generated by it is

unitary. The state PHP

satisﬁes the constraint (8). Clearly, the physical Hamiltonian

Ψ
|

i

is nonlocal, in general, even if the original Hamiltonian has a standard form of the sum of

potential and kinetic energies. However, classical limits of H and Hphys are the same.

The evolution operator has the form

holds when the Hamiltonian H does not explicitly depend on time. The projection operators

t1 and T exp stands for the time ordered exponential. The second equality

before and after the exponential in (11) can be omitted if the initial state satisﬁes the

constraint (8).

The physical Hamiltonian provides the sought-for channel mixing. To ﬁnd terms in the

new Hamiltonian which give rise to the channel mixing, we compute the action of PHP on

a generic state

Ψ

the action of PHP even on the physical states is not reduced to that of H because the

The operator W provides the channel mixing even if the initial state is in the physical

the free negative ion.

C. Interaction potentials

The potential Vat in the Hamiltonian (6) represents the interaction between the active

electron and the ﬂuorine neutral core. It is taken as a local model potential which depends

on the distance r between the electron and the atom center. The potential also includes

a long range polarization interaction. Its explicit form has been adjusted to reproduce the

binding energy of the ion F − as well as the mean radius of the p-orbital. The potential reads

where U0 = 5.64, g = 3.76, a = 1.2558 and the atomic polarizability of a ﬂuorine atom

α = 3.76 [35]. All constants are given in the atomic units.

The potential VS in the Hamiltonian (6) describes the interaction of the active electron

with the Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. It has been proposed by Chulkov et al on the basis

of their ab initio studies [36]. This local potential depends only on the electron coordinate

z along the surface normal.

Its explicit form can be found in Ref. [36]. Qualitatively,

it is an image charge potential in vacuum which joins smoothly an oscillating potential

with the period being that of the (111) planes inside the metal bulk. When describing

an electron motion in the direction perpendicular to the Cu(111) or Ag(111) surface, this

potential represents rather well important features of the surface such as the projected band

gap (between -5.83 and -0.69 eV with respect to vacuum for Cu and between -4.96 and

-0.66 eV for Ag), the surface state (5.33 eV and 4.625 eV below vacuum for Cu(111) and

Ag(111), respectively), and the image state energy positions (0.82 eV and 0.77 eV below

vacuum, respectively, for Cu(111) and Ag(111)). Since the RCT process mainly favors

transitions around the surface normal, this potential is expected to account for the eﬀect of

the pecularities of the Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces.

In order to illustrate the eﬀects of the projected band gap of the Cu(111) and Ag(111)

surfaces, we also present results obtained for a free-electron description of the metal sur-

face. In this case, the local electron-surface interaction potential corresponds to the Al(111)

surface and is taken from the work of Jennings et al [37].

D. Wave packet propagation

In the wave packet propagation (WPP) approach [8,23], one studies the time evolution of

an electron wave function

Ψ(t)

generated by the system Hamiltonian. Here we consider

~r
h

|

both the static and dynamic problems. In the former, the distance between the ion and the

metal surface is ﬁxed, while in the latter the ion collides with the surface. In both cases,

the initial state is the free ion state (5).

12

The time evolution can be regarded as a sequence of inﬁnitesimal time steps generated

terms are typically kept for the time step ∆t = 0.025 atomic units.

From the Laplace transform of the function A(t), one can obtain the density of states (DOS)

projected on the free ion wave function. The structure of the DOS yields the energy level and

its width for the negative ion state interaction with the surface. In what follows, this width

is referred to as the “static width” to emphasize that it is extracted from static calculations.

It gives the electron transfer rate between the negative ion and the metal surface in the

static problem.

In the second series of calculations, we study the evolution of the electron wave packet

when a negative ﬂuorine ion collides with the surface. The ion is assumed to approach the

surface along a straight line perpendicular to the surface at a constant velocity v. Only

the incoming part of the collision is studied. The time dependence of the wave function

is obtained in the projectile reference frame, i.e., the time dependence of the Hamiltonian

occurs through the potential VS. For each collision velocity, the ion survival probability,

P (t, v) =

us to see to what extent the dynamical evolution can be described by the static width of

the ion level.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. F− ions interacting with a surface Al(111)

The interaction of an F − ion with an Al(111) surface, where the latter is regarded as a

free-electron metal surface, has already been studied by the CAM method associated with

the eﬀective range treatment of the negative ion [12,13]. It lead to a successful description

of the negative ion formation in a grazing angle scattering [12]. Similarly, for large angle

scattering from Ag(110), and polycrystalline Ag and Al surfaces, a quantitative agreement

with experiment results [14,45] has been obtained [13].

In Figures 1 and 2 we compare the results obtained in the static case by two diﬀerent

methods: The CAM method with eﬀective range treatment of the negative ion and the

present WPP results obtained with the projection formalism. In both cases, the Al(111)

surface is described as a free-electron metal surface using the potential proposed in [37].

Figures 1 and 2 present, respectively, the energy position and the width of the F − ion level

interacting with the surface as a function of the ion-surface distance Z measured from the

image plane. The characteristics of the ion level as a function of Z display the behavior

common for atomic species in front of a free-electron surface: The energy of the negative ion

state decreases as the ion is placed closer to the surface, which can be anticipated because of

the image charge attraction; The level width increases roughly exponentially as Z decreases.

The results obtained by two diﬀerent methods are extremely close to each other. This gives

conﬁdence in the equivalence of the two descriptions of the F − ion. The results for a free-

electron Al(111) surface are used below as a “free electron” reference to which compare the

Cu(111) and Ag(111) results. It appears that the free electron results are almost identical

for the three metals, except at very small distances from the surface.

16

B. F− ions interacting with a surface Cu(111). A static case

Figures 3 and 4 present the F − ion level characteristics (energy (Fig.3) and width (Fig.4))

as a function of the ion-Cu(111) surface distance. The negative ion level energy exhibits

an avoided crossing around 4a0 from the surface, which is quite diﬀerent from the smooth

behaviour seen in Figures 1 and 2 for the free-electron metal. This is a direct consequence

of the peculiarities of the Cu(111) surface and a similar situation has already been observed

in the case of H- interacting with the same surface [23].

A schematic picture of the electronic structure of the model Cu(111) surface is shown in

Fig. 5. The energy of electronic levels is plotted as a function of the electron momentum, k

,

k
equal to zero, the projected band gap lies within the energy

parallel to the surface. For k

k

range from -5.83 to -0.69 eV (with respect to vacuum). Inside the gap, there is a surface

state at -5.33 eV. In the present model of a Cu surface, the dispersion curves of all the metal

electronic states as functions of k

are parabolic with a free-electron mass.

k

The resonant charge transfer process corresponds to transitions between the ion level

and metal states of the same energy. At large distances, the F − ion level is degenerate

with the band gap. Therefore it can only decay to metal states with a ﬁnite k

i.e. either

k

to the 2D surface state band, or into 3D propagating states. As Z decreases, the energy

of the negative ion state decreases and it comes close to the bottom of the 2D surface

state continuum. The ion can decay by ejecting an electron with the angular momentum

m = 0,

1 (the quantization axis is normal to the surface). As explained in Ref. [23], a

±

resonance cannot cross the bottom of a 2D continuum in the symmetrical case m = 0 and

there always exists a bound state below the bottom of the continuum. This state has an

avoided crossing with the state which becomes the free ion state as Z tends to inﬁnity. The

F − ion character is then found to be associated with two diﬀerent states depending on the

Z range. It is transferred from the upper to the lower state when going through the crossing

region (decreasing Z). Far from the avoided crossing region, the ion energy level is rather

close to that found in the free electron case.

17

As for the width, at large Z, its absolute value for F − in front of the Cu(111) surface is

larger than that in the case of a free-electron surface. This result might appear surprising

since the projected band gap prohibits the electron transfer from the projectile to the metal

along the surface normal (k

= 0) and blocks the RCT into the 3D bulk continuum. Indeed,

k

as can be seen in Fig. 5, there are no electronic states of the metal with small k

which

k

are in resonance with the negative ion state. The potential barrier separating the ion and

the surface attains its least value in the direction normal to the surface. Therefore, the

surface normal is the preferred direction of the resonant electron transfer. One would then

expect that the eﬀect of the projected band gap would be to stabilize the negative ion level

as compared with the case of a free electron metal. This has indeed been found for H −

interacting with Cu(111) where the width of the H − state was much reduced as compared

to the H −/Al(111) - case [23].

In contrast, we have observed an increase of the ﬂuorine negative ion decay rate as

compared to the free-electron metal case. The reason is twofold. First, the 2D surface state

continuum contributes to the decay of F −. Second, a ﬂuorine has a much larger electron

aﬃnity than a hydrogen. Thanks to a better overlap of the wave functions, the 2D surface

state continuum, when energetically allowed, is a dominating decay channel for an ion state

lying within the band gap [23,28,46]. Moreover, when the binding energy of a negative ion

is close to that of the surface state, a coupling of the ion level with the 2D surface state

continuum is more eﬃcient than its coupling with the 3D continuum of the free-electron

metal states (see a discussion in [46]). The eﬃciency of the 2D surface state continuum as a

decay channel can also be deduced from the sharp decrease of the level width when passing

through the crossing region as Z decreases, i.e., when this decay channel becomes closed.

For small values of Z: (i) the 2D surface state continuum does not contribute to the

decay of the negative ion, and (ii) the energy of the negative ion state is very close to the

bottom of the projected band gap for small k

so that the band structure eﬀect for the decay

k
into the 3D bulk continuum vanishes. Therefore, we ﬁnd the width of the level with ionic

character very close to the free-electron results.

18

Finally, we can stress that the procedure of extracting the resonance characteristics

employed here is based on the autocorrelation function (26) using the free F − ion wave

function as the initial state. It converges well for the states of an ionic type. Convergence

of the resonance characteristics for other states is diﬃcult to achieve. This is the reason for

showing only one state far from the crossing region (small or large Z). In the crossing region,

the ionic character is shared between the lower and upper states so that the characteristics

(energy and width) of both of them can be extracted. Since the convergence is easier to

achieve for the energy of the state, the interval of distances Z where both states are presented

is larger in Fig.3.

C. F− ions interacting with an Ag(111) surface. Static and dynamic studies

The electronic structures of Ag(111) and Cu(111) look rather similar (cf. Figures 5 and

6). However, characteristic features of the electronic structures occur at diﬀerent energies.

The surface state in Ag(111) is located higher in energy than in Cu(111). For this reason

the avoided crossing appears at a larger Z where the ion-surface charge transfer interaction

is smaller. As a consequence the avoided crossing could not be resolved in the energy

dependence because it is localised in a too small range of Z. Therefore, we have chosen to

represent the results for the energy and the width by a single continuous line (Figures 7

and 8, respectively). In fact, the energy of the negative ion state is almost the same as for

the free-electron metal surface. The characteristic change of the level width when passing

the crossing region (decreasing Z) is however still perfectly visible.

It fully conﬁrms the

dominance of the 2D surface state channel in the F − ion decay at large Z.

At small Z, the F − ion level is embedded in the 3D propagating states of Ag and its

characteristics are very close to those of the free-electron case. Very close to the surface,

the decrease of the level width as compared to Al(111) free-electron results is caused by the

closeness of the F − level to the bottom of the Ag(111) valence band. As can be seen in Fig.

3b the bottom of the Ag(111) valence band is located at

9.7 eV in our model description

−

19

of the Ag(111) surface. For the model free-electron Al(111) case it is located at

15.9 eV.

−

By studying the time dependent problem, one can ﬁnd out whether the peculiarities of

Ag(111) observed in the static case can still be visible in a collision of F − with the Ag(111)

surface. We have computed the eﬀective level width G, deﬁned by (27), as a function of

the distance for an ion F − approaching the surface at diﬀerent velocities. The results are

displayed in Fig. 9 together with the results of the static case for Ag(111) and the free-

electron metal surface Al(111). As the collision velocity is increased, the eﬀective width

becomes closer to the free-electron result. This feature is very similar to what we have

found for ions H − interacting with a Cu(111) surface [23]. The system needs a ﬁnite time

to react on the presence of the projected band gap. If the collision is too fast, the electron

wave packet does not have enough time to “explore” the band structure of the metal, and

the ion decay remains identical to that on a free-electron metal surface.

In contrast, as the collision velocity is decreased, the eﬀective width comes nearer to

the static Ag(111) width. For the smallest velocity used here, 0.0058 atomic units which

correspond to a collision energy about 16 eV, the eﬀective width is very close to the static one

at large Z. When Z is decreased, the eﬀective width fails to perfectly reproduce the change

of the behavior associated with the crossing of the bottom of the surface state continuum

for all collision velocities considered here. We can nevertheless see that this variation is

better reproduced as the collision velocity is decreased. In fact, the dynamical broadening

introduced by the change of the negative ion state energy with time [47] makes it impossible

to reproduce a sharp variation of the static width as the ion approaches the surface. This

leads to rounded delayed structures displayed in Fig.9. Moreover, the oscillations of the

eﬀective width at small Z can tentatively be attributed to the population transfer between

the two adiabatic states at the crossing region. From these results one can conclude that in

the studied collision energy range, 16 eV – 5 keV, the charge transfer rate is intermediate

between the free-electron case and the static Ag(111) case.

The formation of F − ions and H − ions by collision on a Ag(111) surface has been studied

experimentally by Guillemot and Esaulov [29]. When comparing with results obtained with

20

free-electron like surfaces they found that the H − data presents a strong band gap eﬀect.

In particular, the survival probability of the negative ions leaving the surface was much

larger for Ag(111). This was attributed to the blocking of the resonant charge transfer in

H −/Ag(111) system, in line with theoretical results obtained for H −/Cu(111) [23] where

the RCT rates are reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the free-electron case.

At the same time, results obtained with F − ions were approximately consistent with a

description based on the charge transfer rate obtained in the framework of a free-electron

description of the metal surface. In the energy range studied in their work, as shown above,

the dynamical behaviour of the charge transfer is intermediate between the free-electron and

static Ag(111) limits. This prohibits the use of the simple classical treatment of the parallel

velocity eﬀect [28,48] which was shown to be important for a formation of F −, even at rather

low collision energy [13]. Consequently, we cannot quantitatively compare our results with

theirs. Nevertheless, we can notice that in our study the band gap eﬀect is reversed and much

smaller in the present system than in the H −/Cu(111) system; it is even partly suppressed

by the ion motion. These ﬁndings qualitatively agree with the experimental results [29].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have reported on a study of the electron transfer in the ion-metal systems

F −/Cu(111) and F −/Ag(111). We have developed a new method to describe the eﬀect

of six quasi-equivalent outer-shell electrons of F − on the resonant charge transfer process.

The original six-electron problem has been transformed into two one-electron problems in

which the dynamics are not independent but rather are linked via a constraint. The projec-

tion formalism for quantum systems with constraints has been used to obtain the quantum

mechanical propagator for such a system. This modeling of the ion F − is simple, eﬃcient

and can easily be implemented in the wave packet propagation approach.

Both the Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces exhibit an electronic structure with a projected

band gap in which the ion energy level lies at large ion-surface distances. This peculiarity

21

of the electronic structure inﬂuences the charge transfer interaction with the ion, leading to

a few remarkable features:

•

•

•

•

•

The ion level presents an avoided crossing with the bottom of the surface state con-

tinuum as predicted for a 2D continuum with m = 0. The avoided crossing is very clearly

marked for the system F −/Cu(111).

Because of the correlation between the six electrons of the F − ion the avoided crossing,

which is a characteristic feature of the symmetric case m = 0, appears in the present system

where electrons in both states with m = 0 and

= 1 contribute to the charge transfer.

|
When the negative ion level is low in the projected band gap, the band gap does not

m
|

cause a drastic drop of the charge transfer rate as observed in other systems [23,24]. This

feature of the charge transfer has been attributed to the following eﬀects: (i) The band gap

eﬀect is expected to decrease as the projectile level is lower in the band gap; (ii) The decay

to the surface state is favored over the decay to 3D bulk states because of a greater spatial

overlap of the electron wave function with the surface state; and (iii) The polarization of

negative ions does not enhance the band gap stabilization eﬀect as it does for neutral atoms

(see a discussion in Ref. [46]).

At small ion-surface distances, when the negative ion state is not in the band gap or

inside the gap but close to its bottom, the energy and the width of the negative ion level

are practically identical to those found in the free-electron surface case.

Studies of the corresponding dynamical systems, when the ion F − approaches the

surface, have shown that the above features survive, although partially, over a large collision

energy range.

FIG. 3. Energy position of the F − ion level in front of the model Cu(111) surface, as functions

of the ion-surface distance, measured from the image plane.(atomic units) The energy reference

is the vacuum level. Black dots: results for the free-electron Al(111) surface. The horizontal

dashed-dotted line indicates the energy position of the bottom of the surface state continuum. Solid

line: results for the highest lying resonance. Dashed line: results for the lowest lying resonance.

FIG. 5. A schematic picture of the electronic structure of Cu(111) (work function 4.9 eV) as

a function of the electron momentum parallel to the surface (atomic units). The energy reference

is the vacuum level. The shaded area represents the 3D valence band continuum. The dashed

line represents the 2D surface state continuum. The energy of F − level at some distance from the

surface is displayed as the horizontal solid line.

(Dated: January 25, 2014)

We report on the state-selective detection of near-dissociation ultracold KRb molecules in the
ground X 1Σ+ state and the metastable a3Σ+ state. The molecules are produced by photoassociation
of ultracold atoms followed by radiative decay into high vibrational levels of the X and a states.
Detection utilizes resonance-enhanced one-color two-photon ionization, followed by time-of-ﬂight
mass spectroscopy. Scanning the detection laser frequency over the range 582-625 nm, we observe
transitions from the v′′
−1, and the
v′′
−1. The measured vibrational
spacings are in excellent agreement with those previously measured and those calculated from the
relevant potential curves. Relative vibrational populations are also consistent with Franck-Condon
factors for decay from the photoassociated levels.

INTRODUCTION

implementations have been reported [19, 42].

Following in the footsteps of ultracold atoms, the area
of ultracold molecules has developed rapidly in recent
years [1, 2, 3]. Polar molecules, with their permanent
electric dipole moments, have drawn particular atten-
tion [4]. The dipole moments of these heteronuclear
molecules allow manipulation with applied electric ﬁelds.
Because the dipole-dipole potential is both long-range
and anisotropic, interactions between polar molecules are
fundamentally diﬀerent from those in homonuclear sys-
tems. Potential applications include novel quantum de-
generate systems [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], quantum compu-
tation [12], and tests of fundamental symmetries [13]. In-
vestigations of collisions and reactions at these extremely
low temperatures also promise to open new areas of ul-
tracold chemistry [14, 15, 16].

The technique of ultracold atom photoassociation (PA)
[17] has been the primary means for producing molecules
at translational temperatures below 1 mK [2].
In this
process, laser light resonantly binds two colliding atoms
into an excited molecule which subsequently decays by
spontaneous emission. This method has recently been
successfully adapted to heteronuclear systems [18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Feshbach resonances have been
used to make homonuclear molecules at even lower tem-
peratures [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], in some
cases under quantum degenerate conditions. Based on
recent observations of Feshbach resonances in heteronu-
clear systems [37, 38], it can be expected that this route
will also yield ultracold heteronuclear molecules in due
course. Both PA and Feshbach resonances tend to pro-
duce molecules in high vibrational levels with outer turn-
ing points at long range. Although these high-v′′ states
are of interest for some studies, many applications re-
quire low-v′′ states, because of their improved stability
against inelastic processes and their larger dipole mo-
ments. Various schemes for populating low-v′′ states have
been proposed [9, 12, 20, 39, 40, 41], and some successful

Direct detection of ultracold molecules has gener-
ally utilized photoionization combined with time-of-ﬂight
mass spectroscopy. State selectivity is essential to many
applications and for diagnosing transfer of population.
For example, measuring the v′′ dependence of vibrational
quenching rates due to collisions with ultracold atoms
would be an important ﬁrst step in studying ultracold
molecule collisions. To date, the ability to unambigu-
ously identify the vibrational state of ultracold molecules
has been limited, particularly for levels near dissociation.
Two-photon one-color ionization spectra have been re-
ported in Rb2 [43, 44, 45], but deﬁnitive assignments
and initial state identiﬁcations were not made. We have
recently demonstrated state-selective detection of Rb2,
details of which will be reported elsewhere [46]. In Cs2,
ultracold molecule detection spectra have been compared
to absorption measurements, revealing the role of the dif-
fuse bands in the detection process [47].
In K2, two-
photon two-color ionization spectra enabled some identi-
ﬁcation of the low-v′′ states produced by both one-photon
[48] and two-photon [42] PA. Dissociation with a separate
cw laser helped to clarify the assignment [42]. In Na2,
high-resolution cw ionization spectroscopy yielded clear
identiﬁcation of the highest-lying bound and quasibound
rovibrational-hyperﬁne states [49].

To date, the only heteronuclear system in which state
selectivity has been achieved is RbCs. Using two-photon
two-color ionization, ultracold molecules were detected in
speciﬁc vibrational levels of the a3Σ+ state [18, 20]. In
addition, these molecules have been transferred by stimu-
lated emission pumping to the X 1Σ+ state (v′′=0,1) and
detected in these states with vibrational selectivity [19].
In the present work, we report on vibrationally state-
selective detection of ultracold KRb molecules in high-v′′
levels of both the ground X 1Σ+ state and the metastable
a3Σ+ state. These molecules are formed by cold-atom
photoassociation followed by radiative decay, as shown
in Fig. 1. Two-photon one-color ionization proceeds

sociated (PA) to a bound level vP A below the K(4S)+Rb(5P )
asymptote which subsequently undergoes spontaneous emis-
sion(SE) to either the X 1Σ+ or the a3Σ+ state. These
states are detected by resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI)
through the 41Σ+ and 51Σ+ states (for singlet molecules) or
the 43Σ+ and 33Π states (for triplet molecules).

through resonant intermediate levels of the 41Σ+, 51Σ+,
43Σ+, and 33Π states, allowing vibrational state iden-
tiﬁcation and determination of the relative populations.
Using wavelengths in the range of 582-625 nm, we have
observed vibrational levels v′′=86-92 for the X state and
v′′=17-23 for the a state. We have also analyzed spec-
troscopy of the excited states, details of which will be
reported elsewhere [50].

II. EXPERIMENT

Details of the experimental setup have been described
previously [25, 26]. Here we recount it brieﬂy, focusing
on the ionization detection. The KRb PA takes place
in overlapping clouds of ultracold 39K and 85Rb. High
atomic densities, estimated at 3 × 1010 cm−3 for K and
1 × 1011 cm−3 for Rb, are achieved using “dark-SPOT”
MOTs for each species. Temperatures for K and Rb of
300 µK and 100 µK, respectively, are expected.

The PA process is driven with a cw tunable titanium-
sapphire laser (Coherent 899-29). Its output, typically

2

>400 mW, is focused into the overlapping MOT clouds.
PA spectra, as described previously [25, 26], are obtained
by scanning this laser and measuring the ionization signal
from molecules which have radiatively decayed into the
X 1Σ+ ground state and the metastable a3Σ+ state.

In our earlier work [25, 26], the ionization detection
used a pulsed laser with a broader linewidth and signif-
icant ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE). This pre-
vented state-selective detection but had the beneﬁt of
yielding at least some ion signal at most wavelengths,
thereby facilitating the location of PA resonances.

In the present work, ionization detection is achieved
with a pulsed dye laser (Continuum ND6000) pumped by
a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser at a 10 Hz repetition
rate. The use of two dyes, R610 and DCM, provides spec-
tral coverage over the range 582 nm to 625 nm. The 0.05
cm−1 linewidth of the dye laser is suﬃcient to resolve
the vibrational structure, but not the rotational struc-
ture, of transitions from levels of the X 1Σ+ and a3Σ+
states. This detection laser, with a pulse width of 7 ns
and a typical output power of 3 mJ, is focused to a di-
ameter of 1 mm. This is signiﬁcantly larger than the 0.3
mm diameter of the MOT clouds in order to illuminate
a larger fraction of the ballistically expanding cloud of
cold molecules. Ions from the laser pulse are accelerated
to a channeltron ion detector. KRb+ is discriminated
from other species (K+, Rb+, Rb+
2 ) by its time of ﬂight
(TOF).

III. DETECTION SPECTRA FOR SINGLET
MOLECULES

Detection spectra are obtained by ﬁxing the PA fre-
quency on a resonance and recording the KRb+ ion sig-
nal while scanning the pulsed laser. A 400 cm−1 scan
for X 1Σ+ state molecules is shown in Fig. 2. The spec-
tra display structure on two scales. On a gross scale
(∼20 cm−1), nearly periodic spacings correspond to vi-
brational levels of the upper state of the detection transi-
tion, speciﬁcally the 41Σ+ state for the spectrum shown
in Fig. 2. The spectroscopy of this upper state will be
described separately [50]. Measured level spacings and
the range of levels observed are both in very good agree-
ment with calculations based on ab initio potentials [51].
We note that the increased complexity of the spectrum
at higher frequencies is likely due to the appearance of
transitions to the 51Σ+ state, which are not yet assigned.
On a ﬁner scale (∼5 cm−1), the structure corresponds
to the spacings between high-lying vibrational levels of
the X 1Σ+ ground state. Speciﬁc X-state levels are as-
signed by matching the measured spacings with those
calculated from the potential [52]. Examples are shown
in Fig. 3 for PA to two diﬀerent vibrational levels of
the 3(0+) state. As can be seen, the agreement between
measured and predicted vibrational spacings is excellent,
allowing unambiguous identiﬁcation of the ground-state
levels. A previously measured spacing between v′′=86

and 87 [53] is also in excellent agreement. We note
that although the 3(0+) state comes from the K(4s) +
Rb(5p3/2) asymptote, the PA laser is tuned below the
K(4s) + Rb(5p1/2) asymptote, so predissociation does
not occur.

The relative populations of the various X-state vibra-
tional levels are determined by the Franck-Condon fac-
tors (FCF′s) for decay of the level formed by photoassoci-
ation. We expect that as PA occurs to more deeply bound
levels, with smaller outer turning points, the FCF′s will
favor decay to more deeply bound levels of the X-state.
This is indeed the case, as seen in comparing Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b). The peak of the X-state distribution shifts
to a lower v′′ for the larger (more negative) PA detun-
ing.
If we assume that the ﬁrst (resonant) step of the
two-photon detection process is saturated, and that the
second (ionization) step is saturated and/or structure-
less, then the detection spectra will be a direct measure
of the relative population of X-state vibrational levels.
This distribution is given by the FCF′s for decay of the
photoassociated level, in this case a level of the 3(0+)
state. These FCF′s, calculated using the LEVEL pro-
gram [54], are superimposed on the spectra in Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b). Not only does the measured peak of the distri-
bution shift with detuning as predicted, but the relative
peak heights within each distribution actually match the
FCF calculations rather well.

Using PA detunings for the 3(0+) state over the range
246 cm−1 to 320 cm−1 (measured relative to its K(4S)
+ Rb(5P3/2) asymptote, which lies 237.60 cm−1 above
the K(4S) + Rb(5P1/2) asymptote), we observe X-
state levels from v′′=86-92, which have binding energies
from 29.76 cm−1 to 4.45 cm−1, respectively. The high-
est level in the X state is predicted [52] to be v′′=98.
The molecules we detect are produced over a time in-
terval of several milliseconds before the detection laser
pulse. During this time, they are exposed to the Rb
MOT trap (and repump) light, tuned near the K(4S) +
Rb(5P3/2) asymptote, and PA light. This could cause oﬀ-
resonant reexcitation and subsequent dissociation of the
X-state molecules, particularly for high v′′. Such a state-
dependent destruction mechanism would modify the X-
state vibrational distribution from that intially produced
according to the FCF′s. However, we see no evidence for
this alteration.

IV. DETECTION SPECTRA FOR TRIPLET
MOLECULES

State-selective detection of triplet a3Σ+ molecules is
carried out in a similar manner to that described above
for singlet X 1Σ+ molecules. The only diﬀerence is that
the PA laser is tuned to a level which decays to the a
state. For this work, we use the 3(0−) state from the
K(4S) + Rb(5P3/2) asymptote, which correlates to the
13Π state at short range [26]. Higher detection laser in-
tensities are required for comparable signal levels from

triplet molecules. The triplet detection spectra are ob-
tained over the same wavelength range, but of course
involve diﬀerent upper states: 43Σ+ and probably 33Π.
The spectroscopy of the 43Σ+ state, along with that of
the 41Σ+ state (used for singlet detection), will be de-
scribed in a separate publication [50]. A ∼400 cm−1 scan
is shown in Fig. 4. The structure repeating at ∼50 cm−1
corresponds to the vibrational spacing of the 43Σ+ state.
Assigned vibrational levels are indicated in the ﬁgure.
The congested region of larger signal to the blue may
involve the 33Π state, but speciﬁc assignments have not
yet been made.

Two-photon transitions to atomic Rb Rydberg states
sometimes can be seen as well in the triplet spectra, due
to leakage from the space-charge-broadened Rb+ TOF
peak into the KRb+ TOF peak. We also see ions at the
Rb atomic 5p3/2 →5f one-photon transition. The 5p3/2
level is populated by the MOT lasers and this dipole-
forbidden transition is enabled by the ∼160 V/cm electric
ﬁeld used for extraction. These atomic lines serve as use-
ful frequency markers and verify that the laser frequency
measurements are accurate to 0.16 cm−1. These lines are
not readily observable in the spectra of singlet molecules
(Fig. 2) because lower laser intensities are used.

levels of the a3Σ+ state. The vibrational levels show
spacings of 2.4 to 5.6 cm−1. Such spacings correspond
to levels v′′=20 to 26 in the ab initio potential of Ko-
[55] and v′′=18 to 24 in the ab initio

potentials of Park et al. [56] and of Rousseau et al. [51].
These three potentials have been compared by Zemke
[57]. However, a deﬁnitive assignment has very

recently become available, based on new Fourier Trans-
form Spectra in Hannover [58]. This clearly indicates we
have observed levels v′′=17 to 23, as shown in Table 1.
We also plan to calculate improved Franck-Condon fac-
tors for the Hannover a3Σ+ potential once it is available.
The FCFs in Fig. 5 are based on the Kotochigova et al.
potential [55] for levels 20 to 26. Finally, we plan direct
measurement of the binding energies by scanning a sepa-
rate cw laser to deplete the ground-state levels. We have
recently observed this “ion dip” spectroscopy for X 1Σ+
v′′=89.

FIG. 6:
(Color online) Detection spectrum with overlap-
ping singlet and triplet features. The PA laser is tuned to
−1 below the
a 3(0+) (J=1) level at a detuning of -246.66 cm
K(4S) + Rb (5P3/2) asymptote. X 1Σ+ molecules are de-
tected through 41Σ+ (v′
=33), while a3Σ+ molecules are de-
tected though 43Σ+ (v′=4). Expected singlet and triplet line
positions are indicated.

As for the singlet molecules, we can use the peak
heights as a measure of the lower level (a3Σ+) popu-
lations. There is a small, but noticeable shift in the
distribution to lower v′′ for larger (more negative) PA
detunings. Also shown in these ﬁgures are the calculated
FCF′s for decay from each 3(0−) PA level to various lev-
els of the a3Σ+ state. Calculations using the LEVEL
program [54] reproduce the overall locations of the dis-
tributions, including the shift with PA detuning. How-
ever, compared to the singlet spectra (Fig. 3), individual
peak heights are not as accurately predicted. We hope
future calculations based on the Hannover a3Σ+ poten-
tial, once it is available, can give more accurate results.
Linewidths in the triplet spectra are somewhat broader
than those in the singlet spectra. Power broadening,
spin-spin, second-order spin-orbit, rotational and hyper-
ﬁne structure should all contribute to the line shapes ob-
served.

PA detunings for the 3(0−) state from 244 cm−1 to
323 cm−1 (measured relative to its K(4P ) + Rb(5P3/2)
asymptote) have been used to observe a-state levels from
v′′=17-23. These have binding energies from 29.02 cm−1
to 5.31 cm−1, respectively. This numbering, based on the
Fourier Transform Spectra in Hannover [58], is deﬁnitive
because vibrational assignment is based on two diﬀerent
isotopes. None of the three sets of ab initio potentials
from [51, 55, 56] can give this exact numbering, although
a good vibrational spacing match can be found if we ad-
just their numbering by one or three [57].

An important diﬀerence between singlet and triplet
molecules is that the triplets have a non-zero mag-

5

netic moment and can therefore be magnetically trapped.
We have previously demonstrated this trapping in the
quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT [25, 26] by delay-
ing the molecule detection with respect to the turn-oﬀ
of the PA laser. This diﬀerence in magnetic properties
could be utilized as a singlet/triplet “ﬁlter” to distin-
guish the two types of molecules. We do see cases where
both X 1Σ+ and a3Σ+ molecules appear in the same re-
gion of the detection spectrum. An example, using PA
to the 3(0+) state, is shown in Fig. 6. At long range,
the 3(0+) state should decay to both X 1Σ+ and a3Σ+
states [26], so we expect to detect both. However, the
FCF′s for the ﬁrst step of the detection process play an
important role. For high-v′′ levels of X 1Σ+, the overlap
with 41Σ+ levels comes primarily from the outer turning
point. On the other hand, overlap of high-v′′ levels of
a3Σ+ with 43Σ+ levels comes primarily from the inner
turning point and becomes more favorable in the lower
energy region of the spectrum. The overall detection ef-
ﬁciencies (including the ionization step) for X 1Σ+ and
a3Σ+ become comparable in the region shown in Fig. 6.
Although we do see triplet features in a primarily singlet
detection spectrum (using PA to 3(0+)), we do not see
singlet features in the triplet detection spectra (using PA
to 3(0−)). This is consistent with the fact that at long
range, 3(0+) can decay to both to both X 1Σ+ and a3Σ+
states, while 3(0−) can decay only to a3Σ+ [26].

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have realized vibrationally state-
selective detection of near-dissociation levels of ultracold
KRb molecules in the X 1Σ+ ground state and the a3Σ+
metastable state. This state-selectivity will be crucial to
future experiments in ultracold molecular collisions and
reactions where speciﬁc initial and ﬁnal states must be
measured. This capability is equally important in di-
agnosing population transfer, e.g., from high-v′′ to low-
v′′ [19].
In fact, the ﬁrst step in our singlet detection
(41Σ+ ← X 1Σ+) is a good candidate for realizing this
type of transfer. As an example, if we start in X 1Σ+
(v′′=89), the FCF for excitation to 41Σ+ (v′=40) is quite
large (0.02) due to overlap at the outer turning points.
On the other hand, overlap at the inner turning points
gives a favorable FCF of ∼0.01 for decay (or stimulated
emission) of 41Σ+ (v′=40) to the absolute ground state,
X 1Σ+ (v′′=0). These large FCF′s indicate that coher-
ent two-photon transfer, such as STIRAP [59], should be
feasible with narrow-linewidth quasi-cw lasers.

The two-photon, one-color detection we have employed
is particularly convenient because only one tunable laser
is required. However, the second (ionizing) step gener-
ally requires high intensity, resulting in power broadening
of the ﬁrst (bound-bound) step. Two-photon, two-color
detection (e.g., through states from the K(4s)+Rb(5p)
asymptotes) may oﬀer some beneﬁts. The ionizing step
can be driven with high intensity from a ﬁxed-frequency

pulsed laser, such as a frequency-doubled YAG laser. If
the ﬁrst step is driven with a narrow-linewidth cw laser at
low intensity, rotational resolution should be achievable.

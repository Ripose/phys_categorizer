We report an experimental demonstration of single-photon switching in laser-cooled 87Rb atoms.
A resonant probe pulse with an energy per unit area of one photon per λ2/2π propagates through
−1 due
the optically thick atoms. Its energy transmittance is greater than 63% or loss is less than e
to the eﬀect of electromagnetically induced transparency. In the presence of a switching pulse with
an energy per unit area of 1.4 photons per λ2/2π, the energy transmittance of the same probe pulse
becomes less than 37% or e−1. This substantial reduction of the probe transmittance caused by
single switching photons has potential applications in single-photon-level nonlinear optics and the
manipulation of quantum information.

PACS numbers: 42.50.Gy, 42.65.-k, 32.80.-t

Compared to atoms and molecules, photons are supe-
rior carriers of quantum information because they are
more inert with respect to the environment. Photons
can be used to transport information from quantum logic
gates to quantum memory [1, 2, 3]. The recent devel-
opment of slow light arising from quantum interference
has made storage and retrieval of quantum information
by photon pulses feasible [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and low-light-
level nonlinear optics practical [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Con-
trol of one single-photon pulse by another provides more
degrees of freedom in the manipulation of quantum in-
formation. The interaction between two single-photon
pulses can potentially create entangled photon pairs and
quantum phase gates for applications in quantum tele-
portation [14, 15, 16] and quantum computation [17, 18].
Harris and Yamamoto [19] have suggested the system
of photon switching by quantum interference in which
switching of a single-photon pulse by another can be re-
alized and single-photon-level nonlinear optics is achiev-
able.

In the four-level system of photon switching by quan-
tum interference, a weak probe ﬁeld and a strong cou-
pling ﬁeld form the three-level Λ-type conﬁguration that
gives rise to electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) [20, 21, 22]. Absorption of the probe ﬁeld is sup-
pressed or completely inhibited by the EIT eﬀect. A
switching ﬁeld drives the transition between the ground
state of the coupling ﬁeld and another excited state. The
presence of this ﬁeld enables the absorption of the probe
ﬁeld and induces the three-photon transition from the
ground level of the probe ﬁeld to the excited level of
the switching ﬁeld. With the four-level system, Harris
and Yamamoto obtained the important result that one
switching event of the probe ﬁeld costs one switching
photon under ideal conditions. This result leads to the
intriguing concept of the threefold entangled state de-
picted in Fig. 3 of Ref. [19]. The phenomenon of photon
switching by quantum interference in a four-level atomic
system has been observed by Yan et al. [23] and Braje et

∗Electronic address: yu@phys.nthu.edu.tw

al. [10], and its transient behavior in a simple four-state
system has been studied by Chen et al.
[24]. However,
single-photon switching was not achieved in those experi-
ments. This paper reports the ﬁrst observation of photon
switching at the single-photon level.

We studied photon switching in cold 87Rb atoms pro-
duced by a vapor-cell magneto-optical trap (MOT). Typ-
ically, we trapped 1.2 × 109 in our MOT, as measured
by the optical-pumping method [25]. The size of the
atom cloud was approximately 3.2 × 3.2 × 2.6 mm3. The
coupling, switching, and probe ﬁelds came from three
diode lasers, all of which were injection-locked by the
same master laser. One beam from the master laser was
sent through a 6.8-GHz electro-optic modulator (EOM)
(New Focus 4853). The high-frequency sideband of the
EOM seeded the probe laser. The probe beam had a
1/e diameter of 5.5 mm and passed through a 1-mm
aperture before interacting with atoms. The intensity
or the Rabi frequency of the probe ﬁeld was determined
from the ratio of the power to the area of the aper-
ture. The probe, coupling, and switching ﬁelds reso-
nantly drove |F = 1i → |F ′ = 2i, |F = 2i → |F ′ = 2i,
and |F = 2i → |F ′ = 3i, respectively. (F and F ′ de-
note hyperﬁne levels in the 5S1/2 ground state and 5P3/2
excited state.) Each of them passed through a distinct
acousto-optic modulator (AOM) that could be switched
on or oﬀ individually. The driving frequencies of these
three AOMs were maintained constant throughout the
experiment. The coupling and probe ﬁelds were circu-
larly polarized with right helicity (σ+ polarization). The
switching ﬁeld was also circularly polarized, but with left
helicity (σ− polarization). Considering the Zeeman sub-
levels, our system consisted of three sets of four-state
subsystems. All three ﬁelds propagated in nearly the
same direction.

The timing sequence of the measurement is described
below. We ﬁrst turned oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT
and then, after a 1.45-ms delay, shut oﬀ the repumping
beam and switch on the coupling ﬁeld. The trapping
beams were turned oﬀ 45 µs later to prevent the popula-
tion from being trapped in the |F = 2, m = 2i state. The
entire population was optically pumped to the |F = 1i
ground state. Finally, the probe and switching ﬁelds were

switched on. A 125-MHz photodiode (New Focus 1801)
detected the probe transmission and its output was di-
rectly sent to a digital oscilloscope. After the measure-
ment was complete, the probe, coupling, and switching
ﬁelds were turned oﬀ and the MOT was turned back on.
The above sequence was repeated with a period of 100
ms; data were averaged 128 times by the oscilloscope be-
fore being transferred to the computer.

We measured the steady-state EIT spectrum of the
probe transmission to determine the Rabi frequency of
the coupling ﬁeld, Ωc. The atom number was reduced
in this measurement to identify the absorption maxima.
Figure 1 shows a typical EIT spectrum and the probe
transmission in the absence of the atoms. We scanned
the probe frequency linearly at a rate of 2.5 Γ/ms by
ramping the EOM driving frequency. The sweep rate
was slow enough that the narrow transparency window
could be clearly resolved. Since the atom cloud gradually
expands in the absence of the trap or the cold atoms get
pushed away by the laser ﬁelds during the spectroscopic
measurement, the spectrum is slightly asymmetric [26].
From the separation of the two absorption maxima in the
spectrum, we obtained Ωc = 0.40Γ. This value is about
8% higher than the average of the estimates of the Rabi
frequencies of the three subsystems based on the laser
power and beam proﬁle. All of the Ωc values quoted in
this paper are determined with the spectroscopic mea-
surement. Since the average Rabi frequency of the probe
ﬁeld, Ωp, is 0.07Γ, it can be considered as a weak per-
turbation. By comparing the measured spectrum with
the theoretical prediction of a simple three-level system,
we ﬁnd that the relaxation rate γ of the ground-state
coherence is around 0.002Γ in our system. This value is
consistent with the value we obtained previously in ex-
periments on a simple three-state system [24]. The black
solid line in Fig. 1 shows the probe transmission under
the same experimental conditions except that the switch-
ing ﬁeld is present. This spectrum also reveals that the
optical-pumping eﬀect is changed by the presence of the
switching ﬁeld.

The optical depth of the atoms and the Rabi frequency
of the switching ﬁeld, Ωs, were directly determined from
the delay time of the probe pulse, TD. We generated
the Gaussian pulse of the probe ﬁeld by controlling the
RF power of the AOM that switches the ﬁeld. This con-
trol was achieved with a variable-gain ampliﬁer (Mini-
Circuits ZFL-1000GH) and an arbitrary waveform gen-
erator (SRS DS345). However, the Gaussian pulse width
was limited to about 1 µs. Throughout the experiment,
the energy per unit area of the probe pulse was always
about one photon per λ2/2π. We set the peak of the in-
put probe pulse Ωp,max to 0.10Γ and the pulse width to
2.4 µs. Figure 2 shows the experimental data along with
the best ﬁts of the Gaussian function. For the condition
that all the ﬁelds are on the resonance and γ is negligible,
the delay time is given by [19]

2

where TD is the delay time and N σL is the optical density
of the resonant one-photon probe transition. The probe
width is large enough that the steady-state solution is
valid. In the measurement, Ωc = 0.40Γ. From the delay
time in the EIT condition, we estimate that N σL = 7.1 in
our system. From the ratio of the delay times in the EIT
and switching conditions, we estimate Ωs = 0.21Γ. This
value is about 5% larger than the average of the estimates
of the Rabi frequencies of the three subsystems based
on the laser power and beam proﬁle. All the Ωs values
quoted in this paper are determined with the delay-time
measurement. Unless speciﬁed, the energy per unit area
of the switching pulses is approximately one photon per
λ2/2π or Ωs = 0.12Γ of a 2.4-µs square pulse throughout
the entire experiment.

Figure 3(a) plots the switching eﬃciency for diﬀerent
pulses of the switching ﬁeld. We set Ωc = 0.69Γ and the
probe pulse width to 4.8 µs. The switching eﬃciency is
optimized when the width of the square switching pulse
matches the 1/e width of the probe pulse. This is ex-
pected, since this combination of pulses concentrates all
the energy of the switching ﬁeld on the high-density part
of the probe pulse. The transmitted probe pulse in the
optimized switching condition shows little deviation from
the Gaussian function. When the width of the switch-
ing pulse is less than or equal to half of the probe pulse
width, the transmitted probe pulse is signiﬁcantly dis-
torted. Thus, for the remainder of this report we will
focus on the square switching pulse with a width equal
to the probe pulse width.

Figure 3(b) shows the ratio of the EIT to switching
optical densities for diﬀerent probe pulse widths. In this
study, the coupling intensity was proportional to the re-
ciprocal of the probe pulse width in order to maintain
good EIT bandwidth with respect to frequency band-
width of the probe pulse as well as to keep Ωp,max/Ωc
constant and small. Since the square switching pulse
width is set to the 1/e width of the probe pulse and
its energy per unit area is constant, the intensity of the
switching pulse is also proportional to the reciprocal of
the probe pulse width. The optical density, α, in the
steady-state EIT or switching condition is given by [19]

α = N σL

s + 2γΓ

Ω2
c + Ω2

Ω2

s + 2γΓ

c, Ω2

In the above equation, the probe frequency is assumed on
the resonance. For Ω2
s ≫ 2γΓ, this equation explains
that the data points of the three shorter pulses depend
on τ linearly. In general, a shorter pulse width results
in a better switching eﬃciency. However, the Gaussian
shape is not ideal for pulses of widths less than 2 µs in
the experiment. We chose a pulse width of 2.4 µs for the
measurements shown in Figs. 2, 3(c), and 3(d).

Figure 3(c) plots the energy transmittance versus the
number of switching photons per λ2/2π. The switching
pulse center is delayed 1.2 µs with respect to the probe
pulse center. We ﬁt the data with the function:

TD = N σL

where y(x) is the transmittance, x is Ω2
s in the form of
energy per unit area, α(x) is the optical density described
by Eq. (2), and p is the percentage of the probe energy
without the interaction with the switching ﬁeld. In the
function of α(x), Ωc = 0.40Γ or Ω2
c = 11.1 in the same
units of x, and N σL and γ are the ﬁtting parameters.
For the best ﬁt, p = 0.15 ± 0.02, N σL = 7.4 ± 0.5, and
γ = (4.2 ± 0.4) × 10−3Γ. These values are reasonable
for the experimental conditions. Figure 3(d) shows the
variation in switching eﬃciency as a function of the oﬀset
between the centers of the probe and switching pulses,
td. Interpolation of the data indicates that the best td
should be a little larger than 0.6 µs. An oﬀset of this
magnitude is in line with expectations for a 2.4-µs square
pulse to switch most of the probe energy in the medium,
since the delay time of the probe pulse is 1.2 µs in the
EIT condition and becomes shorter in the presence of the
switching pulse.

The inset of Fig. 2 shows a demonstration of the single-
photon switching. The square switching pulse has an en-
ergy per unit area of 1.4 photons per λ2/2π or Ωs = 0.14Γ
at a width of 2.4 µs. We set td = 0.6 µs, Ωp,max = 0.10Γ,
and Ωc = 0.40Γ. The energy transmittance is 64.1% in
the EIT condition, but becomes 36.9% in the switching
condition. The delay times are 1.2 and 0.95 µs in the ab-
sence and presence of the switching pulse, respectively.
The probe pulse in the inset shows discontinuities in its
slope at two places due to the rising and falling edges of
the square switching pulse.

The experimental system can be improved in the fol-
lowing ways. (i) Incorporation of a compressed MOT [27]
into the measurement sequence can increase the density
of the cold atoms, and hence the optical density of the
one-photon probe transition. (ii) The spectral width of
the master laser that injection-locks the probe, coupling,
and switching lasers is about 0.5Γ, including the modula-
tion amplitude and residual ﬂuctuation in the frequency
stabilization. This laser linewidth does not inﬂuence the
EIT eﬀect, but decreases the absorption in the photon
switching. Reduction of the laser linewidth may enhance
the switching eﬃciency. (iii) The entire population can

3

be optically pumped to the |F = 1, m = 0i state dur-
ing the measurement of the probe transmittance. The
experiment will then become a simple four-level system
consisting of the |F = 1, m = 0i, |F ′ = 2, m = 1i,
|F = 2, m = 0i, and |F ′ = 3, m = −1i states. Since the
|F = 1, m = 0i and |F = 2, m = 0i states are immune
to the axial magnetic ﬁeld, the relaxation rate of the
ground-state coherence can be further reduced by adding
a stable magnetic ﬁeld in the propagation direction of
the three laser ﬁelds. (iv) There are AOM drivers with
a higher bandwidth of RF power control. Utilizing such
driver to generate shorter Gaussian pulses can improve
the switching eﬃciency as demonstrated in Fig. 3(b). (v)
The probe and switching pulses should be coupled into
the same optical ﬁber in order to achieve a perfect spatial
overlap. After interacting with the atoms, the outgoing
pulses can be distinguished by using a quarter-wave plate
and a polarizing beam splitter.

In conclusion, we have systematically studied the pho-
ton switching by quantum interference in laser-cooled
87Rb atoms and demonstrated single-photon switching.
The experimental system is optically thick such that the
probe pulse of one photon per λ2/2π is absorbed to e−7
by propagating through the atoms. The presence of the
coupling ﬁeld at a moderate intensity or Ωc = 0.4Γ sup-
presses the one-photon absorption and reduces the energy
loss of the probe pulse to less than e−1. When the probe
pulse co-propagates with the switching pulse of 1.4 pho-
tons per λ2/2π in the constant presence of the coupling
ﬁeld, two-photon absorption decreases the energy trans-
mittance of the probe pulse to e−1. Studies similar to
those in Refs. [11, 12, 13] can now be performed at the in-
triguing energy level of single photons. Our results show
that applications exploiting single-photon-level nonlinear
optics and the three-fold entangled state to manipulate
quantum information are coming to realization.

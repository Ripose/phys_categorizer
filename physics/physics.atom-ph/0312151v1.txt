INTRODUCTION

Recently, several high-precision experiments have been performed on the bound-electron

g-factor in H-like carbon and oxygen by the Mainz-GSI collaboration [1, 2]. The value

actually measured in the experiment is (g m/M), where m is the electron mass, M is the ion

mass, and g is the g-factor of the electron. The relative accuracy of the best experimental

determination of this value [1] is 5 × 10−10, which is 4 times better than that of the accepted

value for the electron mass [3]. Further progress is anticipated from the experimental side,

as well as extension of measurements to the higher-Z region [4].

The spectacular experimental results have triggered great interest to the theoretical de-

scription of the g-factor of a bound electron [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

18, 19, 20, 21]. Combining experimental values with accurate theoretical predictions for

the bound-electron g-factor resulted in an independent determination of the electron mass

[14, 17]. The current accuracy of this determination [17] is 4 times better than that of the

accepted value for the electron mass [3]. For the latest compilation of various contributions

to the bound-electron g-factor we refer the reader to [20] for H-like ions and to [18, 21] for

Li-like ions.

In the present work we give a detailed description of our calculation of the self-energy

correction to the bound-electron g-factor for 1s and 2s states of a H-like ion. The ﬁrst results

of this calculation for the 1s state were previously published in [17], where they were used

for the determination of the electron mass. In this paper, we extend our consideration to a

higher-Z region and perform calculations also for the 2s state, having in mind the planned

extension of the experiments to Li-like systems.

Our calculation is carried out in the Feynman gauge. The relativistic units (¯h = c = 1)

and the Heaviside charge units (α = e2/4π, e < 0) are used throughout the paper. We also

use the notations p/ = pµγµ and ˆp = p/|p|.

II. BASIC FORMULAS

In this paper we will consider a bound electron in an s state of a H-like ions with a

spinless nucleus interacting with a static homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. The bound-electron

g-factor is deﬁned by

g = −

hjama|µz|jamai
µ0 ma

,

where µ is the operator of the magnetic moment of the electron, µ0 = |e|/(2m) is the Bohr

magneton, ja is the total angular momentum of the electron, and ma is its projection. The

lowest-order value for the g factor can be found by a simple relativistic calculation based on

the Dirac equation [22]. For an s state and the point nucleus, it yields

energy shift, as given by

∆E = ∆g µ0Bma ,

Various contributions to the g-factor are related to the corresponding corrections to the

where the magnetic ﬁeld B is assumed to be directed along the z axis. In the present in-

vestigation we are interested in the self-energy correction to the bound-electron g-factor. It

is diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 1. Formal expressions for the corresponding contribu-

tions can easily be derived, e.g., by the two-time Green function method [23]. They can be

also obtained by considering the ﬁrst-order perturbation of the self-energy correction by a

perturbing magnetic potential δV (x) [24, 25].

The contribution of the diagram (b) is referred to as the vertex (”ver”) term and is given

where δV (x) = −e α · A(x), A is the vector potential A(x) = (1/2)[B × x], u = 1 − i0 where

the small imaginary addition preserves the correct circumvention of poles of the electron

propagators, I(ω) is the operator of the electron-electron interaction,

I(ω) = e2αµανDµν(ω) ,

αµ = (1, α) are the Dirac matrices, and Dµν is the photon propagator. The contribution

of the diagrams (a) and (c) is conveniently divided into 2 parts that are referred to as

the irreducible and the reducible one. The reducible (”red”) contribution is deﬁned as a

part in which the intermediate states in the spectral decomposition of the middle electron

propagator (between the self-energy loop and the magnetic interaction) coincide with the

initial valence state. The irreducible (”ir”) part is given by the remainder. It can be written

in terms of non-diagonal matrix elements of the self-energy function as

∆Eir = hδa|γ0

Σ(εa)|ai + ha|γ0

Σ(εa)|δai ,

III. DETAILED ANALYSIS

ε=εa
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

The irreducible contribution (6) is written in terms of non-diagonal matrix elements of

the self-energy function. Its renormalization is well known and we do not discuss it here.

For the point nuclear model, the perturbed wave function |δai can be evaluated analytically

in a closed form by using the method of generalized virial relations for the Dirac equation

[26]. The explicit expression for the |δai function can be found in [11].

Both the vertex and reducible contributions are ultraviolet (UV) divergent.

In order

to covariantly renormalize them, we expand the bound-electron propagators in Eqs.

(4)

and (9) in terms of the interaction with the binding ﬁeld. According to the number of

interactions (with the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld), the corresponding contributions are referred

to as the zero-potential, one-potential, and many-potential terms. For the vertex diagram,

this decomposition is schematically presented in Fig. 2. We thus represent the vertex and

reducible parts as

∆Ever = ∆E(0)

∆Ered = ∆E(0)

ver + ∆E(1)
red + ∆E(1)

ver + ∆E(2+)
ver
red + ∆E(2+)
red ,

,

where the superscript corresponds to the number of interactions with the binding ﬁeld. It

is often convenient to consider the vertex and the reducible terms together. In this case, we

will use the following notation

∆E(i)

vr = ∆E(i)

ver + ∆E(i)
red ,

where i = {0, 1, 2+}.

By elementary power-counting arguments one can show that all terms containing one

or more interactions with the binding ﬁeld are UV ﬁnite. Despite the fact that the one-

potential term is ﬁnite, we prefer to consider it separately, as was ﬁrst proposed in [6]. The

reason for such treatment is that, when evaluated in coordinate space, the one-potential term

yields a slowly-converging partial-wave expansion, which represents the main computational

diﬃculty in the low-Z region. The numerical scheme developed for the computation of this

term in [6, 7] allowed to extend the summation well beyond 100 partial waves, which explains

much better accuracy obtained in that work as compared to the ﬁrst evaluation [5]. In our

approach, we evaluate the one-potential term directly in momentum space without utilizing

the partial-wave expansion. In this way we eliminate the uncertainty due to the estimation

of the uncalculated tail of the series.

A. Zero-potential contribution

The expression for the zero-potential vertex term can be obtained from Eq. (4) by replac-

ing all bound-electron propagators by the free propagators. Writing it in momentum space,

we have

This concludes our consideration of the zero-potential vertex contribution.

The described approach to the evaluation of the zero-potential vertex term was ﬁrst

employed in [5]. We mention also a diﬀerent treatment of this term suggested by the Swedish

group [6, 7]. In that work, the δ function in Eq. (14) was approximated by a continuous

Gaussian function with a small cutoﬀ parameter. An advantage of the presented approach is

that we end up with a single integration that remains to be performed numerically, while the

consideration of [6, 7] leaves a 4-dimensional integration in ﬁnal formulas. This complication

is not crucial for the zero-potential term since it is relatively simple. For the one-potential

term, however, the consideration is more diﬃcult, and the approach based on the integration

by parts turns out to be extremely helpful.

C. Many-potential term

Expressions for the many-potential term can be obtained by the point-by-point subtrac-

tion of the corresponding zero- and one-potential contributions from the unrenormalized

expressions (4) and (9). In order to transform them to the form suitable for a numerical

evaluation, we have to perform the summation over the magnetic substates and the integra-

tion over the angular variables. This can be carried out by using standard techniques (see,

e.g., [29]). We present here only the results for the unrenormalized contributions. The ﬁnal

expressions can be obtained from them by the corresponding point-by-point subtractions.

The vertex correction to the g-factor is given by (a is an s state)

We mention that both the vertex and the reducible contribution are infrared (IR) diver-

gent. The divergence occurs when εn1 = εn2 = εa in the vertex term and εn = εa in the

reducible term. However, the sum of these terms can be shown to be convergent. In prac-

tical calculations, we perform the ω integration for the sum of the vertex and the reducible

17

contributions. In that case, the integrand is a regular function for small values of ω and can

be numerically integrated up to the desirable accuracy.

IV. HIGH-PRECISION EVALUATION OF THE IRREDUCIBLE

CONTRIBUTION

In this section we describe adaptations of the approach developed in [32, 33, 34]. In this

method, the renormalization scheme is completely performed in coordinate space, which

provide a great simpliﬁcation in the numerical evaluation. In that method the integration

over the photon energy z is done last. The complex plane integration contour is divided in

two parts [35]. The contour around the bound state poles of the electron propagator gives

the low-energy part, which reads, in Feynman gauge:

, (84)

where δa is the ﬁrst order wave function correction (7), εa is the energy and ψa the wave-

function of the bound state under consideration and P denotes a principal value integral.

Here we use the Feynman gauge for the low-energy part instead of the Coulomb gauge in

Ref. [34] to be compatible with the gauge used in the vertex and reducible part calculations.

Here the integrand is well enough behaved that the transformation of the low-energy part

in Coulomb gauge done in [35] to improve numerical accuracy is no longer required. The

high energy parts is written as

where b = −i [(εa − z)2 + iδ]1/2 , Re(b) > 0, and x21 = x2 − x1. The index µ is summed

from 0 to 3. The contour CH extends from −i∞ to 0 − iǫ and from 0 + iǫ to +i∞, with

the appropriate branch of b chosen in each case. Note that the sign change in (84) and (85)

compared to Refs. [34, 35] comes from the opposite convention G(ε) = (H − ε)−1 used in

those works.

Because we do not do a transformation to Coulomb gauge in (84) angular integration is now

identical to the one done for the high-energy part (85) as described in [35], and lead to the

same angular coeﬃcients.

The high-energy part is split into two pieces ∆Eir,HA and ∆Eir,HB. In ∆Eir,HA the Coulomb

Green’s function is expanded around the free one up to the one potential term, the wave-

function is expanded around x1 ≈ x2, which is the place from which singularities that lead

to ultraviolet divergence arise. This part must thus contains the regularization term. The

regularized integral is evaluated analytically. The high-energy remainder ∆Eir,HB, which is

ﬁnite is evaluated numerically. The details of the method are described in Refs. [32, 33, 34].

Because the cancellations that occurs in the normal self-energy (the contribution is formally

of order αm, while the ﬁnal result is of order αm(Zα)4, leading to the loss of 9 signiﬁcant

ﬁgures at Z = 1), are not present here, very high accuracy can be reached even at low-Z.

At Z = 1 one looses only 3.5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures for 1s state and 4 for 2s states. Convergence

of the numerical evaluation of the integrals is checked by doing a sequence of numerical

calculations with increasing number of integration points in all three integrations. In the

case of Z = 1, we have observed that the value obtained with this method, provides a ﬁnal

answer in slight disagreement with the results from the Zα expansion, even though the con-

vergence of the numerical integration would lead to think that accuracy is larger than the

observed diﬀerence. This loss of accuracy is probably due to the code used for the numerical

evaluation of the Green function in the high-energy part ∆Eir,HB. Due to that fact, we do

not use the method described for this section for Z = 1, and for Z = 2, we used the half-sum

of the value obtained with the method of this section and from the one described in Sec. III.

The diﬀerent contributions to the irreducible part, evaluated by the method described in

this section are presented in tables I and II for 1s and 2s respectively.

V. NUMERICAL EVALUATION AND RESULTS

We start with reporting some details about our numerical evaluation. The calculation

for 1s and 2s states was performed for the point nucleus. In addition, for the ground state,

we repeated our evaluation for the hollow-shell model of the nuclear-charge distribution and

tabulated the diﬀerence as the nuclear-size eﬀect ∆gNS.

The calculation of the irreducible part is quite straightforward. For the point nucleus, the

perturbed wave function |δai can be found analytically in a closed form [11]. In calculations

involving an extended nucleus, the perturbed wave function was evaluated numerically,

stored on a grid and then obtained in an arbitrary point by interpolation. The calculation of

a non-diagonal matrix element of the self-energy function was carried out by two independent

numerical methods. The ﬁrst one is based on an expansion of the bound-electron propagator

in terms of interactions with the binding ﬁeld [31] (for details of the numerical procedure see

[29]), whereas the second one is described in Sec. IV. Numerical results obtained by both

methods are in good agreement with each other. Point-nucleus results for the irreducible

part are listed in Tables III and IV. Presented values are obtained the by the second method

in all cases, except Z = 1 and 2 for the 1s state. For Z = 1, we used the result obtained

by the ﬁrst method; for Z = 2, a half-sum of the values obtained by the two methods was

employed.

The evaluation of the zero-potential and one-potential contributions ∆g(0)

vr and ∆g(1)
vr

is

relatively simple. The zero-potential contribution [given by Eqs. (27), (36), and (42)] con-

tains a single numerical integration that can easily be carried out to arbitrary precision. The

one-potential contribution [Eqs. (65), (78), and (79)] contains a 5-dimensional integration.

The integration over one of the Feynman parameters can be carried out analytically, which

speeds up the calculation signiﬁcantly. The evaluation of this contribution is rather similar

to that of the one-potential term to the ﬁrst-order self-energy correction [29]. Point-nucleus

results for the zero-potential and the one-potential contribution are listed correspondingly

in the third and the forth column of Tables III and IV.

The evaluation of the many-potential contribution is the most diﬃcult numerical part

of the present investigation and mainly deﬁnes the total uncertainty of the results. Since

the actual calculation of the many-potential term is carried out by taking the point-by-

point diﬀerence of the unrenormalized, the free, and the one-potential contributions, one

should be aware about large numerical cancellations that occur in this diﬀerence. Additional

cancellations appear when the vertex term is added to the reducible contribution. The

ﬁnal formulas for the many-potential term contain an inﬁnite summation over the angular-

momentum parameter. (This expansion is often referred to as the partial-wave expansion.)

In our approach, we chose the absolute value of the relativistic angular parameter κ of

intermediate electron states, |κ| = j + 1/2, to be the expansion parameter. The summation

was evaluated up to |κmax| = 25 − 35, and the tail of the expansion was estimated by a

22

least-squares inverse-polynomial ﬁtting.

The general scheme of the evaluation of the many-potential contribution is similar to that

of our previous investigation [36]. A new feature introduced in this work in the case of the

2s state is that we do not introduce subtractions anymore that remove infrared divergences

separately in the vertex and the reducible term. Instead, we evaluate the integration over

ω for the sum of Eqs. (80) and (83). In this case, infrared singularities that are present

in two parts of the integrand cancel each other and the total integrand is a smooth regular

function. This modiﬁcation of the numerical procedure allows us to avoid an additional loss

of accuracy due to numerical cancellations.

The following contour was used for the ω integration in the present work: (ε0 − i∞, ε0 −

i0] + [ε0 − i0, −i0] + [i0, ε0 + i0] + [ε0 + i0, ε0 + i∞). This contour is advantageous for the

evaluation of self-energy corrections in the low-Z region since it avoids the appearance of pole

terms that lead to additional numerical cancellations. The parameter ε0 in the deﬁnition of

the contour can be varied. In actual calculations its value was taken to be about Zα εa for

low Z.

The results of our numerical evaluation for the 1s and 2s states are presented in Tables III

and IV, respectively. For the ground state, we list both the point-nucleus and the extended-

nucleus result. It should be noted that the uncertainty speciﬁed for the latter result refers to

the estimated numerical error only and does not include the nuclear-model dependence. We

estimate the model dependence of the nuclear-size eﬀect ∆gNS to be about 1%. Numerical

values of the root-mean-square radii used in our evaluation coincide with those of [7]. For

the ground state, we compare our values with the results of the previous evaluations [5, 7].

The results of [5] were obtained for the point nucleus, while the evaluation [7] was carried out

employing the homogeneously-charged spherical model for the nuclear-charge distribution.

Finally, we compare our numerical values with the analytical results based on the Zα

expansion and isolate the higher-order contribution Fh.o.(Zα) that incorporates terms of

order (Zα)4 and higher,

∆gSE =

1 + (Zα)2 a20 + (Zα)4Fh.o.(Zα)

,

where the ﬁrst term in the brackets is the known Schwinger correction, the second term

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have presented our evaluation of the one-loop self-energy correction to the

electron g-factor of 1s and 2s states in H-like ions. As compared to the previous calculations

of this correction for the 1s state, an improvement of accuracy of about an order of magnitude

has been achieved in the low-Z region. For the most interesting experimental cases, H-like

carbon and oxygen, our calculation improved the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for

the g-factor by a factor of 3 for carbon and by a factor of 2 for oxygen [17], which reduced

the uncertainty of the electron-mass determination based on these values. The new value

for the electron mass is [1, 17]

me = 0.000 548 579 909 29 (29)(8) ,

(89)

where the ﬁrst uncertainty originates from the experimental value for the ratio of the elec-

tronic Larmor precession frequency and the cyclotron frequency of the ion in the trap, and

the second error comes from the theoretical value for the bound-electron g-factor.

In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 72, 033415 (2005)], it was shown that sub-Doppler cooling
occurs in a standing-wave Raman scheme (SWRS) that can lead to reduced period optical lattices.
These calculations are extended to allow for non-zero detuning of the Raman transitions. New phys-
ical phenomena are encountered, including cooling to non-zero velocities, combinations of Sisyphus
and ”corkscrew” polarization cooling, and somewhat unusual origins of the friction force. The cal-
culations are carried out in a semi-classical approximation and a dressed state picture is introduced
to aid in the interpretation of the results.

INTRODUCTION

In a previous paper [1] (hereafter referred to as I), we have shown that sub-Doppler cooling occurs in a standing-wave
Raman scheme (SWRS). The SWRS is particularly interesting since it is an atom-ﬁeld geometry that leads to optical
lattices having reduced periodicity. Reduced period optical lattices have potential applications in nanolithography
and as eﬃcient scatterers of soft x-rays. Moreover, they could be used to increase the density of Bose condensates
in a Mott insulator phase when there is exactly one atom per lattice site. With the decreased separation between
lattice sites, electric and/or magnetic dipole interactions are increased, allowing one to more easily carry out the
entanglement needed in quantum information applications [2].

In this paper, the calculations of I, which were restricted to two-photon resonance of the Raman ﬁelds, are extended
to allow for non-zero Raman detunings. There are several reasons to consider non-zero detunings. From a fundamental
physics viewpoint, many new eﬀects arise. For example, one ﬁnds that, for non-zero detuning, it is possible to cool
atoms to non-zero velocities, but only if both pairs of Raman ﬁelds in the SWRS are present, despite the fact that
the major contribution to the friction force comes from atoms that are resonant with a single pair of ﬁelds. This
is a rather surprising result since it is the only case we know of where non-resonant atoms that act as a catalyst
for the cooling. Moreover, comparable cooling to zero velocity and non-zero velocities can occur simultaneously, but
the cooling mechanisms diﬀer. We also ﬁnd eﬀects which are strangely reminiscent of normal Doppler cooling, even
though conventional Doppler cooling is totally neglected in this work. A dressed atom picture is introduced to simplify
the calculations in certain limits; however, in contrast to conventional theories of laser cooling, nonadiabatic coupling
between the dressed states limits the usefulness of this approach. The non-adiabatic transitions result from the unique
potentials that are encountered in the SWRS. To our knowledge, there are no analogous calculations of laser cooling
in the literature.

The basic geometry is indicated schematically in Fig. 1. Transitions between states

From a practical point of view, there is also a need for calculations involving non-zero detunings. For example, in
the quantum computing scheme proposed in [2], the Raman frequency diﬀers at diﬀerent sites owing to the presence
of an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, making it impossible to be in two-photon resonance throughout the sample. As
a result, one has to assess the modiﬁcations in cooling (and eventually trapping) resulting from non-zero detunings.

The propagation vectors are chosen such that k3 =
k. The frequencies of ﬁelds E1 and E3 are taken to be
nearly equal, as are the frequencies of ﬁelds E2 and E4, but it is assumed that the frequency diﬀerences are suﬃcient
to ensure that ﬁelds E1 and E3 (or E2 and E4) do not interfere in driving single photon transitions, nor do ﬁelds E1
and E4 (or E2 and E3) drive Raman transitions between levels 1 and 2 [4]. On the other hand, the combined pairs
of counter-propagating ﬁelds (E1 and E2) and (E3 and E4) do interfere in driving the 1
2 Raman transition and
act as a “standing wave” Raman ﬁeld which, to lowest order in the ﬁeld strengths, leads to a modulation of the ﬁnal
state population given by cos(4kz). In this manner, a grating having period λ/4 is created.

The friction force and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are calculated using a semiclassical approach. For δ

= 0, they diﬀer
qualitatively from the corresponding quantities obtained in standard Sisyphus cooling. The physical origin of the
friction force was discussed in I. The calculation can also be carried out using a quantum Monte-Carlo approach, but
the results of such a calculation are deferred to a future planned publication.

II. SEMI-CLASSICAL EQUATIONS

As in I, we consider the somewhat unphysical level scheme in which states

in Fig. 1 have angular
momentum J = 0, while state
has angular momentum J = 1. The ﬁeld intensities are adjusted such that the Rabi
frequencies χ (assumed real) associated with all the atom-ﬁeld transitions are equal (Rabi frequencies are deﬁned
µE/2~,where µ is a component of the dipole moment matrix element between ground and excited states), and
by
the partial decay rate of level 3 to each of levels 1 and 2 is taken equal to Γ/2 (equal branching ratios for the two
transitions). The ﬁelds all are assumed to have the same linear polarization; there is no polarization gradient. The
results would be unchanged if the ﬁelds were all σ+ polarized.

It should be noted that Eq. (10) diﬀers qualitatively from the corresponding equation encountered in high intensity
laser theory. Owing to the fact that decay of u, v, w is linked to spontaneous emission, the decay parameters depend
on ﬁeld intensity. When all frequencies are normalized to the optical pumping rate Γ′, the eﬀective coupling strength
σ is actually independent of ﬁeld strength; moreover, since it is assumed that σ > 1, one is always in a ”high intensity”
limit. In contrast to the equations describing conventional Sisyphus cooling or high intensity laser theory, there is a
source term for u, but no source term for the population diﬀerence w.

Equation (16) can be solved using Fourier series and a backwards recursion scheme [6, 7], as outlined in the

Appendix. In this manner one obtains

(cid:2)

ξf (d = 0) = α(1 + α2)−1 , ξsp(0) = ξst(0) = (1 + α2)−1

where ξf , ξsp, ξst are given as Eq. (A17) in the Appendix. An analytic solution for the ξs can be found only for
d = 0
; otherwise, these quantities must be obtained via
the recursive solutions. The eﬀective ﬁeld strength parameter in this problem is σ and one might expect that σ/α
recursions are needed to solve Eqs. (A6) accurately [6, 7]. Actually, the number of recursions required depends in a
somewhat complicated manner on the values of several parameters. Each recursion introduces resonances at speciﬁc
values of α which can be interpreted as Stark-shifted, velocity tuned resonances [8]. For example, with d = 0, the
lowest order recursive solution has a very strong (proportional to σ2), narrow resonance at α2 = 3/5, but the second
order approximation removes the divergence, while introducing yet a second resonance. Some of these velocity tuned
resonances are seen in some of the graphs presented below. For d > 1, an upper bound for the number of recursions
required to map out all the resonances is of order (σ/d) (σ/α) ; for d
1 only a few terms are needed.
Even if only a single recursion is needed, the general expressions for ξf , ξsp, ξst are still fairly complicated.

σ > 1, the friction force as a function of α contains three dispersion-like structures centered at
d. This implies that atoms can be cooled to these values of α. The amplitude of the component centered
α = 0,
at α = 0 is of order σ2/d2 while its width is of order unity. On the other hand, the amplitude of the components
d are of order 1/σ while their width are of order σ. It is shown below that the central peak in the
centered at α =
momentum distribution is negligible compared with the two side peaks in the limit d
σ > 1; that is, in this limit
d for which the atoms are Doppler shifted into resonance with the
cooling occurs more eﬃciently to velocities α =
two-photon transitions connecting levels 1 and 2. The width of the α =
d components is similar to that found in
sub-Doppler cooling in magnetic ﬁelds (MILC) [9]; in both MILC and the SWRS, the qualitative dependence for the
friction coeﬃcient as a function of α is similar to that found in sub-Doppler cooling using ”corkscrew” polarization
[10]. As such, the curve is ”power broadened,” since the eﬀective ﬁeld strength in the problem is σ.

It is tempting to consider the contribution to the friction force near α = d as arising from the single pair of ﬁelds
(E1 and E2), since these ﬁelds are nearly resonant with the 1-2 transition in a reference frame moving at 2kv = δ.
Tempting as it may be, this interpretation is wrong, since we have already shown in I that, for a single pair of Raman
ﬁelds, the friction force vanishes identically, regardless of detuning. Thus, it is necessary that the second pair of ﬁelds

be present, even if they are far oﬀ resonance with atoms satisfying 2kv = δ. The main eﬀect of the second pair of
ﬁelds is to cancel the contribution to the force from the population diﬀerence between levels 1 and 2 (see Appendix
A in I), leaving the contribution from the 1-2 coherence only (u = ρ12 + ρ21). Near 2kv = δ the major contribution
to u does come from atoms that are nearly resonant with the 1-2 transition in a reference frame moving at 2kv = δ,
but the scattering of the second pair of ﬁelds (E3 and E4) from the population diﬀerence created by the resonant pair
of ﬁelds modiﬁes the net force on the atoms. In some sense, one can view the second pair of ﬁelds as enabling the
cooling at 2kv = δ. Note that the magnitude of the damping coeﬃcient is down by σ2 from that at d = 0; it is of the
same order as that found in sub-Doppler cooling using ”corkscrew” polarization [10].

For arbitrary values of α and δ, with σ of order 10, the recursive solution converges very rapidly for most values
of α and numerical solutions can be obtained quickly and easily. Two examples are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, where
the averaged friction force ¯F in units of ~kωr and the averaged diﬀusion coeﬃcients ¯Dst and ¯Dsp in units ~2k2ωr are
plotted as a function of the scaled momentum ¯p = p/~k. In terms of the ξs deﬁned by Eqs (20), these quantities can
be written as

In Fig. 2, I = 10, σ = 10, and ˜δ = δ/ωr = 20. One sees in these curves a number of velocity tuned resonances under
a ”power-broadened” envelope [8]. In Fig. 3, I = 10, σ = 10, and ˜δ = 220, implying that d = 110 and σ/d = 1/11. In
this limit Eqs. (21), (22) are valid and we see three contributions to the averaged force and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. The
˜δ/4 are typical of corkscrew
values of the force and diﬀusion coeﬃcients near the Doppler tuned resonances at ¯p =
polarization cooling [10], and the ratio of the force to diﬀusion coeﬃcient is of order 1/~k. On the other hand, this
ratio is of order 1/~kσ near ¯p = 0, a result that is typical of Sisyphus cooling in a lin
lin geometry; however, both
the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are smaller than those in conventional Sisyphus cooling by a factor (σ/d)2 when

B.

Iterative Solution

Since the eﬀective ﬁeld strength is always greater than unity, perturbative solutions of Eqs (10) are not of much use.
However, one can get a very rough qualitative estimate of the dependence on detuning of the friction and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients near α = 0 by considering an iterative solution of Eqs. (10) in powers of α. This will work only in the
d
limit that α < 1, so it cannot correctly reproduce the contributions to the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients at α =
σ > 1. The iterative solution is useful mainly when d2 . σ2, since, in this limit, the dominant contribution
when d
to the momentum distribution comes from the region near α = 0.

By diagonalizing this Hamiltonian one obtains semiclassical dressed states whose energies, as a function of x are said
to characterize the optical potentials associated with this problem. It turns out that the use of dressed states in the
SWRS is of somewhat limited use, owing to nonadiabatic coupling between the potentials. Nevertheless, the dressed
states do provide additional insight to the cooling dynamics.

In contrast to other dressed state theories, the dressed states here are of limited use since the nonadiabatic coupling
is always signiﬁcant. This is related to the fact that the decay constants are intimately related to the coupling strength,
that the potentials periodically approach one another, and that the nonadiabatic coupling is maximal at these close
(σ/d) sin x]. The dressed picture gives a reasonable approximation to the friction and diﬀusion

V. SUMMARY

We have extended the calculations of I to allow for non-zero detuning in a standing-wave Raman scheme (SWRS)
that results in reduced period optical lattices. The results diﬀer from that of conventional Sisyphus cooling. Optimal
cooling occurs for exact two-photon resonance, but many new and interesting features appear for non-zero detuning.
A dressed atom picture was introduced, but had limited usefulness, owing to the presence of nonadiabatic transitions.
In a future planned publication, we will look at Monte Carlo solutions to this problem and examine the dynamics of
the velocity distribution. Speciﬁcally we will attempt to determine how the atomic momentum jumps between the
momentum peaks shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore we will see if it is possible to localize atoms in the potential wells
shown in Fig. 4. The ability to do so would imply separation of λ/8 between atoms in adjacent wells.

The ﬁnal solution for the spatially averaged friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients depends only on W0, W±1. However, to
calculate these quantities all the other W s must be evaluated. In practice, we truncate Eq. (A6) by setting W±n = 0
and then compare the solution with that obtained by setting W±(n+1) = 0; when these solutions diﬀer by less than a
fraction of a percent, we use the result to evaluate W±2/W±1, from which one can then calculate W0, W±1.

The procedure is to obtain C+ and C− according to the continued fraction solutions Eq. (A9) and Eq. (A10) and
then ﬁnd W−1,0,1 from Eq. (A11).

Next we calculate η1,2, Eq.(18a)-(18b) using Eqs. (A1), (A11), (14a) as

η1 =

a0S + 2a1~kσ

+ W0a2 + W1a3 + W−1a4(cid:21)

η2 =

Using Eqs. (A16) with the Fokker-Plank equations (17) and (19), one can identify the averaged force and diﬀusion

coeﬃcients appearing in Eqs. (20) with

ξf = (a0 + θ0a2 + θ1a3 + θ−1a4),
ξsp = (b0 + θ0b2 + θ1b3 + θ−1b4),
ξst = (a1 + ζ0a2 + ζ1a3 + ζ−1a4).

[3] This condition is necessary to neglect the eﬀects of ﬁelds E1 acting on the 2-3 transition and E2 acting on the 1-3 transition
with regards to light shifts and optical pumping; however, it is possible to neglect the eﬀect of ﬁelds E2 and E1 driving
coherent transitions between levels 1 and 2 (with E2 acting on the 1-3 transition and E1 acting on the 2-3 transition)
under the much weaker condition that the optical pumping rates be much smaller than ω21.

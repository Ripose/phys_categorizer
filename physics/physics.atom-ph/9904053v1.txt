We study the dynamics of the Potassium atom in the
mid-infrared, high intensity, short laser pulse regime. We as-
certain our numerical convergence by comparing the results
of two diﬀerent propagation methods of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. We present ionization curves in the
12-, 13-, and 14-photon ionization range for Potassium. The
ionization curve of a scaled system, namely Hydrogen starting
from the 2s, is compared to the 12-photon results. In the 13-
photon regime, a dynamic resonance is observed and analyzed
in more detail. The results for all wavelengths and intensities,
including the case of Hydrogen, display a clear plateau forma-
tion in the peak-heights of the low energy part of the Above
Threshold Ionization (ATI) spectrum, which scales with the
ponderomotive energy Up, and extends to (2.8 ± 0.5)Up.

I. INTRODUCTION

The motivation for this work has its origin in recent
experimental data by DiMauro et al [1] who studied high
order harmonic generation (HOHG) and above threshold
ionization (ATI) in potassium driven by strong radia-
tion in the wavelength range 3200–3900 nm. Although
HOHG and ATI have been and continue to be studied
extensively, the bulk of the data and theory have concen-
trated on the noble gases. Experimental convenience has
been one of the reasons for this preference, but, at least
as far as HOHG is concerned, their relatively high ion-
ization potentials and resistance to ionization have also
tilted attention in their direction. The alkali atoms be-
long to an entirely diﬀerent class, when it comes to their
behaviour under strong ﬁeld excitation. For atomic num-
bers comparable to the respective noble gas (potassium
versus argon in our context), their ionization potential
is lower by more than a factor of three. Their excited
states and distribution of the oscillator strength for tran-
sitions from the ground state are also considerably diﬀer-
ent. The energy of the ﬁrst excited state in potassium is
much closer to the ground state than it is in argon. As a
consequence, if we consider, for example, 12-photon ion-
ization in potassium, ﬁve of the photons reach above the
ﬁrst excited state, and the rest seven must be absorbed

within the manifold of its excited states.
In contrast,
for 12-photon ionization of argon, it takes nine photons
to reach the energy range of the ﬁrst excited state and
only the remaining three will involve excitation within
the manifold of excited states.
In addition, the wave-
length needed for potassium (about 3000 nm) is longer
by a factor of three than that needed for argon (about
1100 nm).

One might thus expect that, in the process of ioniza-
tion, an extensive manifold of excited and Rydberg states
will be strongly driven and perhaps populated. This
should lead to a structure in the ATI energy spectrum
diﬀerent in appearance from what we are accustomed to.
One might also anticipate that the behaviour should have
similarities with that observed in Rydberg states driven
by microwave ﬁelds. Resolution requirements in photo-
electron energy analysis do not allow the observation of
individual ATI peaks in that case, while it is quite fea-
sible to resolve such peaks in potassium driven from its
ground state by radiation at mid-infrared wavelengths;
as Sheehy et al. [1] have shown. It is the exploration of
possible links and similarities between these two situa-
tions that induced us to undertake this work. Clearly,
the requirements on intensity for saturation are expected
to be lower in potassium than in argon. Moreover, given
the expected participation of manifolds of excited states
in potassium, the Keldysh parameter as a criterion for
the departure from multiphoton ionization may not be
as valid as it should be in argon where most of the en-
ergy interval from the ground state to the continuum
is empty of excited states; immitating thus better the
Keldysh model which is essentially based on a ground
state and an ionization threshold.

The outline of this paper is as follows: The theory,
namely the model used to describe the atom, and the two
propagation methods used to solve the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation are brieﬂy presented in section (II).
Section (III), starts with a presentation of the param-
eter range of the simulations that follow and a demon-
stration of convergence by comparing two diﬀerent meth-
ods. It then moves on to present results in the 12-, 13-,
and 14-photon ionization range, and discuss a low-energy
plateau in the ATI spectrum. 12-photon ionization of
Hydrogen starting from the 2s is compared to the results
from Potassium. We conclude in section (IV), by summa-

1

rizing the main ﬁndings of our results. In the appendix
we present some details of the atomic structure model,
and compare it to an alternative approach.

II. METHOD

Potassium, being an alkali atom, can be considered as
a single electron system for most of the phenomena in
which double excitation does not play an essential role.
The ﬁrst ionization threshold is about 4.34 eV above the
ground state, while 18.8 eV are needed to reach the low-
est doubly excited state, which leaves us with enough
room to study single electron dynamics. The simplest
way to do this is by using a model potential which in-
corporates the eﬀect of the core electrons, and thus re-
duces the dynamics to a single electron scheme. Diﬀer-
ent implementations of this basic idea have been used
so far, with some success, in the Single Active Electron
approach, pioneered by Kulander [2], the frozen core cal-
culations [3], and other model potential calculations [4].
For our purpose, which is the study of the dynamics in
the mid-infrared, it is suﬃcient to use a simple form of
the potential, proposed by Hellmann [5], which in atomic
units is given as:

Vm = −

+ A

1
r

e−Kr
r

,

(1)

where A is 1.989, K is 0.898. All formulas that follow are
given in atomic units. The Hellmann potential with the
above mentioned parameters, results in a ground state
energy of 38950 wavenumbers from the ﬁrst ionization
threshold, which is 11% lower than the actual ground
state of 35010 wavenumbers. Due to the diﬀerence in the
ground state energies of the model potential and the real
atom, we also use a scaled wavelength, namely we rescale
the energy of the photon that would be needed in an ex-
periment that studies the same process, by the ratio of
the model to the theoretical ground state energy. An al-
ternative approach is to correct the energy of the ground
state, and probably some matrix elements to satisfy the
oscillator strength sum rules, but this leads to nonlocal
modiﬁcations in the Hamiltonian and is diﬃcult to im-
plement eﬀectively when the propagation is not done in
an eigenbasis expansion.

The dynamical part of the problem is treated by solv-
ing the resulting time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in
the dipole approximation:

i∂tΨ(r, t) = [Ha + D(t)] Ψ(r, t),

(2)

shown that the expansion of the wavefunction in terms
of spherical harmonics can be shortened dramatically if
the velocity gauge is used instead of the length gauge. In
the velocity gauge, the dipole operator can be cast in the
following form:

D(t) = −αA(t) · p,

(3)

where α is the ﬁne structure constant, p is the momentum
operator, and A(t) is the vector potential which, within
the dipole approximation, has no spatial dependence. We
choose a convenient form for the pulse envelope, namely
a cos2, avoiding the long tails of a Gaussian that make
the numerics more diﬃcult, without signiﬁcantly aﬀect-
ing the results. The explicit form is:

A(t) =

cos(

)2 cos(ωt), with t ∈ [

E0
ω

πt
τ

−τ
2

,

τ
2

],

(4)

where A(t) is the amplitude of the vector potential, τ /2
is the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), E0 and
ω the maximum ﬁeld strength, and fundamental fre-
quency respectively. For the solution of the resulting
time-dependent equations, we choose a spherical coor-
dinates system, which is most convenient for analyzing
the initial and ﬁnal conditions, and it has been proven
to be numerically more eﬃcient for the majority of cases
studied so far. We then conﬁne the space within a box,
centered around the nucleus; this is achieved by impos-
ing zero boundary condition on the radial wavefunction
at a large enough radius, the radius being varied when
we check our convergence.

We have used two methods of propagating the TDSE,
namely a propagation onto eigenstates in a box [7,8], and
a propagation on a B-Splines basis [6,9]. The expansion
of the time-dependent wavefunction on an eigenbasis set
reads:

Ψ(t) = X
l,n

bl,n(t)Φl

n(E),

(5)

where Φl
n(E) are the ﬁeld-free box eigenstates of the atom
of angular momentum l. Since we use linearly polar-
ized light, we need only use the m = 0 magnetic quan-
tum number, as the initial state has m = 0, and dipole
transition selection rules forbid mixing of other magnetic
sublevels. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is
transformed into:

i

d
dt

bl,n(t) = X
n′l′

(Enlδnn′ δll′ − Dnl,n′l′ (t))bl′,n′(t),

(6)

where Ψ is the wavefunction describing the outer elec-
tron, and depends on the spatial electronic coordinates
and on time, Ha is the time-independent ﬁeld-free atomic
Hamiltonian, and D(t) is the dipole interaction of the
atom with the ﬁeld. We only use the velocity form of
the interaction operator, following detailed studies on
the convergence properties of the solution [6], which have

with the initial condition |bl=0,n=1(0)|2 = 1. Enl are
the eigenvalues in the box, Dnl,n′l′ the dipole matrix ele-
ments. Thus the problem has been transformed to a set of
ordinary diﬀerential equations for the coeﬃcients bl,n(t)
of the wavefunction, which is solved by a high order, ex-
plicit propagation method; in our case a ﬁfth-order and
sixth-order Runge-Kutta-Verner method is used. The

2

96 fs to 136 fs for the results that we will present. The
wavelengths that we use are scaled, to compensate for the
inaccuracy of the ground state energy, and are such that
12-, 13- and 14-photon ionization takes place. An inten-
sity range estimate is obtained by calculating the general-
ized cross-section by a scaling technique [13,14], using the
energy (0.295 Hartree), and radius (5.24 a.u.) obtained
by use of the general Hartree-Fock code published by
Froese-Fischer [15]. From the cross-section, a saturation
intensity estimate is given by solving Γteﬀ = 1, where Γ is
the ionization width, and teﬀ an eﬀective pulse duration,
of the order of its FWHM [16]. After the ﬁrst calcula-
tions, and by trial and error, it soon turned out that this
saturation intensity was underestimated by more than an
order of magnitude, which is acceptable, given the origi-
nal intention of the scaling technique to provide a lower
bound for the real cross-section.

ionization yield is calculated by adding up the proba-
bilities of being in a discretized continuum state at the
end of the pulse, while the above threshold ionization
(ATI) spectrum is obtained by the window operator pro-
jection technique [10,11]. Bound state populations are
given directly by looking at the square norm of the co-
eﬃcients of equation (5). For the construction of the
box-eigenstates which are used as our basis, we use an
expansion onto B-Splines, a method that is gaining mo-
mentum in many parts of atomic physics as was pointed
out in [12]. The codes we use are based on ideas pub-
lished in [3,7], rebuilt to account for the need of large
boxes, and the lack of conﬁguration interaction in the
problem at hand. It should be stressed that after the ba-
sis has been constructed (i.e. energies and relative matrix
elements are calculated), the whole procedure is neutral
to the basis creation technique.

The second approach rests on expanding the radial
part of the time-dependent wavefunction directly in
terms of B-splines [6,9]:

Ψ(r, t) = X
il

bl
i(t)

where in addition to the spherical harmonics, B(k)
(r)
is the i-th B-spline of order k depending only on the
radial coordinate and bl
i(t) are time-dependent coeﬃ-
cients to be determined by the solution of the TDSE.
Again, only m = 0 magnetic quantum numbers are used.
The major diﬀerence in this approach lies in the fact
that we need not prediagonalize anything other than
the initial state. Substitution of equation (7) into the
Schr¨odinger equation (2)leads to a banded system of dif-
ferential equations, which is solved by implicit propaga-
tion techniques, currently involving a Bi-conjugate gradi-
ent method with preconditioner. This second method of
propagation scales only linearly with increasing the box
size, thus it is more eﬃcient to use when we need a very
large box. While our original exploratory calculations
have been made with the eigenbasis expansion method,
that works quite well for small boxes, most of the results
presented in what follows have been obtained through
the direct expansion of the time-dependent Hamiltonian
onto B-Splines.

III. RESULTS & DISCUSSION

The only guideline to our study is the experiment by
Sheehy et al. [1], in which 12-, 13-, and 14-photon ion-
ization of Potassium has been studied, with 3.2 µm, 3.6
µm, and 3.9 µm, 1.5 ps pulses respectively, and intensities
close to saturation. The 1.5 ps pulse is too long to deal
with in the TDSE framework, so we have chosen to place
our study in the short pulse regime, with the total pulse
duration τ of the cos2 pulse being 20 optical cycles, which
(depending on the wavelength) corresponds to a width of

3

est energy photons in the 13-photon ionization range.
A truncated part of the bound atomic levels, of angular
momentum up to 4, are shown, together with the quan-
tum paths leading to 13-photon ionization. Graphs of
this type prove to be useful tools when qualitatively ana-
lyzing the processes involved in multiphoton phenomena.
In our study, we analyze the wavefunction at the end
of the pulse, and thus obtain information on the elec-
tron spectrum and ionization. Depending on the phys-
ical quantity we are looking for, the parameters needed
to achieve convergence vary, making it easier to obtain
the value of angle and energy integrated ionization, than
the ATI spectrum. We have assured the convergence of
our results, by varying the box size and the grid sam-
pling density, in a way similar to what has been pre-
sented in [9], and by relying on empirical ﬁndings such as
the deﬁnition of Ec, or the needed density of discretized
continuum states per photon energy, to guide our pa-
rameter choice. This time, we have also conducted an
ultimate test of the numerics involved, namely, we have
compared the two diﬀerent methods of solving the prob-
lem, either with a box-eigenbasis, or a direct expansion
of the radial part in a B-Splines basis. A selected re-
sult, for a tough quantity such as the ATI spectrum in
the 13-photon range, is shown in ﬁgure (2), where the
results of the two simulations of a 3300 nm, 7 × 1011
W/cm2, 110 fs pulse are displayed on top of each other.
The direct B-Splines method uses a box of 3000 a.u.,
with 3000 linearly sampled B-splines of order 7, for each
angular momentum up to l = 20, parameters that have
proven more than enough for the method to converge in
the range shown. After the propagation is over, a projec-
tion to scattering states is used to obtain the ATI spec-
trum. The eigenstates expansion uses a box of 2500 a.u.,
with 2500 linearly sampled B-Splines of order 9 for each
angular momentum up to l = 15 to construct the eigen-
basis. This basis was then truncated to the lowest 1500
basis elements per angular momentum; using only the
1000 lowest states proved to be suﬃcient for the energy
range presented here, since the higher energy discretized
continuum states play a role mostly in the high energy,
low-yield part of the spectrum. The window-operator
technique [10] was used to obtain the photoelectron spec-
trum after the simulation, and the spectrum was renor-
malized to compare with the B-Splines spectrum.

For some characteristic wavelengths, corresponding to
12-photon ionization scaled from the experimental wave-
length, and the limits of the 13-photon ionization range,
we show, in table (I), the FWHM duration τ /2, its scaled-
theory saturation intensity Is, and the upper limit Ec of
the converged spectrum in terms of electron energy for
a 3000 atomic units box. Ec is calculated by estimating
the energy needed for a free electron originally placed
at the nucleus to reach the boundary of the box during
the pulse; it proves a simple estimate of the box needed
when studying ATI spectra, as was analyzed in section
(5) of [9]. Next, and for two intensities, we show the
ponderomotive energy Up, which is the major compo-
nent of the shift of the Rydberg states and the contin-
uum [17–19]. It is given by:

Up =

∼ Iλ2

I
4ω2
0

where I is the laser intensity, ω0 the photon energy and λ
the corresponding wavelength. For the highest intensities
that we use, the ponderomotive energy is a multiple of
the photon energy which is around a third of an eV for the
wavelengths in the table. We also present the Keldysh
tunneling parameter γ [20], deﬁned by:

(8)

(9)

γ2 =

Ip
2Up

where Ip is the ionization potential, and Up the pondero-
motive potential. Note that for all wavelengths, and for
intensities up to 2 × 1012 W/cm2, γ is bigger than one,
thus, according to the Keldysh theory of tunneling ion-
ization, the process lies in the multiphoton regime, and
it is meaningful to refer to the order of the transitions
involved.

FIG. 2. Two diﬀerent, time-dependent methods of calcula-
tion of the dynamics of the Potassium model potential, for a
3300 nm, 7 × 1011 W/cm2, 110 fs, cos2 pulse. The full line is
the ATI spectrum from the B-splines expansion method, and
the dashed line is the result of the eigenbasis calculation.

Despite the diﬀerences in the methods used, we observe
an excellent agreement of the results in ﬁgure (2), even on
a logarithmic scale. The B-Splines method shows richer
structure at the minima between the peaks, demonstrat-
ing its superiority at the ﬁnest parts of the results. Notice
the clean formation of a plateau in the ATI-peak heights,
showing up in both methods, and extending over the ﬁrst
5 to 6 peaks; we study this plateau later on in the pa-
per. Since, in theory, the two methods are related by
a unitary transformation of the basis, from a spatially
localized (B-Splines) to a ﬁeld-free diagonal (eigenbasis)
representation, the agreement of the results is expected;
in practice, however, convergence is largely aﬀected by
the underlying numerics, especially when it comes to ATI
spectra, which stress the ﬁne parts of our codes. This is
the most unbiased procedure we have used up to now,
to ascertain the accuracy of our results. All results pre-
sented from now on are from calculations with the direct
expansion into B-splines, which is more eﬃcient both in
computer space and time, when the scale of the simu-
lation increases. We have compared the results of both
methods for all intensities at 3300 nm (13-photon range),
and some intensities in the 12-photon range (2880 nm),
the convergence of all other calculations presented was
assured within the B-Splines propagation method only.

FIG. 3. The ion yield versus intensity, and a ﬁt of the
low-intensity data to a power law. A 96 fs, 2880 nm cos 2
pulse is used.

We ﬁrst present the ionization spectra, starting from
the 12-photon process, and using a 2880 nm pulse, with a
width of 96 fs, for intensities ranging from 1011 W/cm2 to
1013 W/cm2. A 2000 a.u. box with 2000 linearly sampled
B-Splines of order 7, for each angular momentum up to
l = 20, proves suﬃcient for obtaining the ion yield. In ﬁg-
ure (3) we present the results, together with a power-law
ﬁt to the low-intensity part of the spectrum. Saturation
sets in at about 3 × 1012 W/cm2, substantially higher
than the scaled estimate of 1011 W/cm2. As was already
mentioned, the higher saturation intensity is consistent
with the fact that the scaling technique provides only
a lower-bound for the cross-section. The low-intensity
spectrum seems to follow a multiphoton perturbative be-
havior, in agreement with the value of the tunneling pa-
rameter γ in table (I), and thus the power-law; but the
least squares ﬁt yields a slope of 7.5, substantially smaller
than the lowest-order perturbation theory expectation of
12. The same behavior appears in the experimental re-
sults [1], where in the 12-photon ionization curve, a slope
of 7 is measured.

with the 12-photon quantum paths leading to ionization,

is chosen instead of the ground state of Hydrogen as the

generacies, resemble those of Potassium.

FIG. 5. Ion yields for Hydrogen starting from the 2s in
the 12-photon regime, and a ﬁt of the low-intensity part to a
power law. A 136 fs, 4090 nm cos2 pulse is used.

The resulting ion yield of a 136 fs pulse is shown in
ﬁgure (5). A 3500 a.u. box with 3500 linearly sampled
B-Splines of order 7 for each of the 21 angular momenta
is used; this is certainly an overkill just for obtaining
the ionization spectrum, but we also analyzed the ATI
spectra which needs such large boxes due to the long
propagation times involved. We see the same kind of
structureless saturated spectrum; albeit in this case the
yield is higher for the same intensities (notice the scales
in the ﬁgures), and the saturation intensity is smaller
by a factor of 2, in accordance with the scaling relations
that predict a higher cross-section for Hydrogen starting
from the 2s. The low-intensity part again shows a linear
dependence in the log-log plot, and this time the slope is
5.7, even less than what it is in Potassium. The slopes
in both Potassium and Hydrogen 2s, roughly equal the
order needed to ionize from the ﬁrst exited state, the 4p
and 3s or 3d respectively, yet, no unambiguous model
conforming to all of our data could be constructed.

pulse is used.

We move on to the 13-photon ionization case, whose
spectrum shows an unexpected feature. In ﬁgure (6) we
show the ion yield versus intensity, using 3300 nm, 110
fs pulses, calculated inside a box of 3000 a.u. with 3000
B-Splines per angular momentum up to l = 20. The sat-
uration intensity is similar to the one in the 12-photon
case, and again a power-law behaviour of the signal with
intensity holds for the lowest intensities.
In this case,
however, we observe a “knee” in the ion-yield curve, for
intensities around 8 × 1011 W/cm2. This feature, resem-
bles a dynamic resonance, which was rather unexpected
given the very high order of the processes involved.

In ﬁgure (7) we plot the distribution of the ﬁnal bound
states for an intensity of 7 × 1011 W/cm2. We plot
the population probability, versus the principal quantum
number for a few of the lowest angular momenta. Most
of the population is still in the ground state at this inten-
sity, while most of the excited population is concentrated
in the 4p state; the same is true for all lower intensi-
ties. There is a lot of structure in the low-angular mo-
mentum, low-excited states, then a smooth, mostly ﬂat
part, and a bump at the highest excitations. This bump
turns out to be artiﬁcial, created by the pseudostates ly-
ing between the true bound states and the discretized
continuum states. We concluded this by observing that
by making the box smaller, and thus changing the num-
ber of supported bound states, the same eﬀect always
appeared in the region just before the continuum. The
smooth region just before the bump is expected, given
the small energy diﬀerences of these states, compared to
the shifts experienced during the pulse.

cycles cos2 pulse is used. We use boxes of 2000 a.u., with
2000 linearly sampled B-Splines of order 7, for each of the 21
lowest angular momenta.

In order to shed more light in the behavior of the
“knee” we performed a series of calculations, for diﬀerent
wavelengths, scanning the entire 13-photon range, from
3125 nm, to 3300 nm, with a step of 25 nm, and with
pulses of 20 optical cycles, whose widths correspond to
104 fs for the 3125 nm wavelength, and to 110 fs for 3300
nm.
In ﬁgure (8), we plot the ion yield, as a function
of the wavelength, for a series of intensities ranging from
1011 W/cm2, to 3 × 1012 W/cm2. The curves separate
in a natural way, since for a ﬁxed wavelength a higher
intensity yields more ionization, and we note that for the
highest intensities, above about 1012 W/cm2, all wave-
lengths result in practically the same yield. We label
only the intensities of interest in the graph, which are
in the range of 2–8×1011 W/cm2, were we see a broad

FIG. 9. The ion yield and the total excitation for (left to
right, and top to bottom) 3150, 3200, 3250, and 3300 nm
radiation and a 20 cycles pulse. A box of 2000 a.u. is used.

In ﬁgure (9) we plot (for a few, selected wavelengths)
the ionization curves, together with the total excitation,
which is deﬁned as the population in all bound states,
other than the ground state, at the end of the pulse.
The excitation is essentially dominated by the popula-
tion of the 4p state, for most of the low- to mid-intensity
range. Note the smooth variation of the curves with the
wavelength; the results for the other wavelengths of ﬁg-
ure (8), essentially interpolate the ones shown here. All
curves exhibit a “knee”, which is more pronounced in the
excitation spectrum; after that, ionization mimics exci-
tation in its behavior, whereas for the lower intensities
— see especially 3150nm and 3200 nm — their behavior
may diﬀer substantially. One can argue that the low in-
tensity part is typical in the multiphoton picture, where
the diﬀerence in the orders of the processes involved is
expected to show up as a diﬀerence in excitation com-
pared to ionization. In a Floquet picture, few selected
avoided crossings would describe the bulk of the dynam-
ics. As the intensity increases, and higher excitations
play a more important role, a regime is reached, where
ionization and excitation are linked, similar to the tran-
sition to the classical chaos regime, which has been dis-
cussed in the microwave context, for example in [21].

For all wavelengths, and all

intensities below the
“knee”, the bound state distribution is qualitatively sim-
ilar to the one in ﬁgure (7), with the 4p being by far the
most excited state. On the basis of ﬁgure (1), this could
happen assuming the shifts of the 4s and 4p to be such
that the two states are brought closer together when the
ﬁeld is on. Indeed, by calculating the lowest order shift in
the presence of the ﬁeld and at the wavelengths of inter-
est, it turns out that the 4s state shift is negative, and rel-

atively small, whereas the 4p state, repelled by 5s, shifts
down by more than three times as much. Thus, and for
the largest energy photons in the 13-photon range, there
is a resonant excitation of the 4p state during the pulse,
while for the lowest energy photons of the same range,
the shift pushes the states towards each other easing a
near-resonant transfer. The phenomenon of a low exci-
tation playing an essential role in a 13-photon ionization
process, is easier to imagine in an atom like Potassium,
than in Hydrogen starting from the ground state, since
the excitation happens at less than half the energy that
is needed to reach ionization. It should be noted here,
that 13-photon ionization simulations in Hydrogen, start-
ing from the 2s at a scaled 13-photon wavelength of 4474
nm, displays no corresponding feature, which can is at-
tributed to the diﬀerence in the lowest excitation, as can
be seen from ﬁgure (4).

We close our discussion of ionization curves, by pre-
senting in ﬁgure (10) the results of 14-photon ionization
calculations, at a 3510 nm wavelength, with a 117 fs
pulse. A 3000 a.u. box was used, with 3000 B-Splines
of order 7 per angular momentum, up to angular mo-
mentum l = 20.

We move on to the presentation of the ATI spectra,
which, as seen in ﬁgure (2), exhibit a clean plateau in
the low energy range. This plateau shows up at all wave-
lengths considered, and also in the Hydrogen simulations
starting from the 2s, and it can thus be considered as
a global feature for mid-infrared wavelengths.
In ﬁg-
ure (11) a series of ATI spectra at 3300 nm, 110 fs cos2
pulses, and for all integer multiples of 1011 W/cm2 up
to 1012 W/cm2 is shown; the higher the intensity, the
higher the signal shown in the ﬁgure. A box of 3000 a.u.,
with 3000 B-splines of order 7 for each of the angular mo-
menta up to l = 20 is used. The vertical axis in the ﬁgure
measures the ionization probability density in 1/eV. The
shift of the ATI peaks to lower energies with increasing
intensity is linear with intensity, and, as expected, is well
described by the ponderomotive shift of the ionization

A clearer way of viewing this phenomenon is presented
in ﬁgure (12). We plot the height of the ﬁrst few ATI
peaks versus the intensity of the pulse, this time for a
3150 nm wavelength, and a width of 105 fs corresponding
again to a 20 cycles pulse. Notice the power law (linear
dependence on a log-log plot) of the ﬁrst few peak-heights
with the intensity. This indicates that a perturbative
process is taking place. As the intensity increases, more
peaks enter the plateau range and the perturbative pic-
ture ceases to hold. In ﬁgure (12), this is demonstrated
by the merging of the curves, which implies that for a
range of peaks, their heights are basically the same. As
the intensity increases, the plateau expands and more
curves merge.

In ﬁgure (13), we show the plateau range plotted versus
the intensity for the calculation shown in ﬁgure (11). In
this ﬁgure, the plateau range is deﬁned as the abscissa
of the interception of a horizontal line joining the ﬁrst
few peaks, and a line over the decreasing peaks of the
spectrum. The ﬁt was made by hand, to manually remove
the eﬀect of accidental resonances in the ﬁrst peaks of the
spectrum. We notice the sharp linear dependence of the
plateau range on the intensity. On the same ﬁgure, we
show a ﬁt of the selected points to a linear function of
intensity. The least squares ﬁt gives a plateau range of
(2.35×10−12±5×10−14)eV cm2/W×I +(0.25±0.033)eV.
In terms of Up for the 3300 nm wavelength, the same
equation reads: (2.45 ± 0.05)Up + (0.25 ± 0.033) eV. This
shows a plateau scaling in proportion to 2.45 × Up.

FIG. 13. ATI spectra plateau range as a function of in-

deﬁnition of plateau range.

To clarify the relation of the plateau to the pondero-
motive energy, we combine all of the data from the simu-
lations in the 12-, and 13-photon range. We simplify the
deﬁnition of the extent of the plateau to a rigorous one,
whose extraction from the data is automated, namely,
we use the abscissa of the ﬁrst peak at which the expo-
nential fall of the peak heights begins. The results are
shown in ﬁgure (14), where for each intensity the plateau
range in terms of Up is shown for all wavelengths. The
error-bars reﬂect the imprecision due to cases in which
the plateau ends between two consecutive peaks. From
the deﬁnition of the plateau range that we use, it follows
that the real plateau has the same probability to be lo-
cated anywhere within our error-bars. Notice the huge
uncertainty (larger than Up) at small intensities which
reﬂects the fact that Up is smaller than the peak spacing.
At higher intensities, the ponderomotive shift grows un-
til it is considerably larger than the peak-spacing, which
makes the error-bars shrink to less than Up. The data is
ﬁtted to a normal distribution with an average value of
2.8 Up and a standard deviation of 0.5 Up.

This result relates to the classical theory of the ioniza-
tion process, as has been ﬁrst developed in the simple-
man’s model [22–24]. The main arguments have recently
been clearly restated in the appendix of [25], although in
the context of a rescattering picture [26]. The idea rests
upon the fact that a free-electron can maximally gain 3.17
Up within a ﬁeld, returning to its original position. This
happens within the ﬁrst cycle, or the ﬁrst period of the
electronic motion, subsequent cycles lead to 2.4 Up, and
then to less until the maxima gradually converge to 2 Up
over many cycles, and the average kinetic energy becomes
Up. A relevant study has been made more than 10 years
ago by Gallagher in the microwave regime [23]. In [23],
microwave ionization of Na Rydberg states is studied,
and the spectra are explained using the above mentioned
theory. In that paper, a plot of the extend of the spec-
trum starting from the 40 s state of Na, shows approx-
imate scaling with 3.45 Up. An energy of Up should be
subtracted when compared to short-pulse experiments,
as in this case the electrons do not keep the extra pon-
deromotive energy since they cannot sample the spatial
gradient of the ﬁeld. After the observation, in the opti-
cal regime, of the long-range plateau extending from 2 to
8 Up [27,28], the theory has been extended to include a
backscattering to the nucleus, and could provide answers
to pertinent questions [26,29]. It should be noted that
other than the original Gallagher experiment, all these
experiments and theories exhibit a steep fall in the re-
gion up to 2Up, which then stabilizes or falls with a lower
slope in the region from 2 to 8 Up. This is in contrast
to our ﬁndings in the mid-infrared regime, which shows
a smooth, almost ﬂat region in the low energy spectra,
and an increased downward slope afterwards. Due to the
numerical demands on convergence, in the present study
we do not analyze the region up to and beyond 8 Up, and
cannot therefore establish the presence or not of a second

9

plateau.

We have also conﬁrmed that the plateau feature has
no relation to the atomic structure involved, by exam-
ining the ATI spectrum in the scaled problem, namely
12-photon ionization of Hydrogen starting from the 2s
state. The data are from the simulations corresponding
to the situation displayed in ﬁgure (4), and the param-
eters used are the same as those used to plot ﬁgure (5).
Few selected ATI spectra are shown in ﬁgure (15), which
all display the plateau feature, whose range is estimated
as 2.6 ± 0.3Up, close to what we obtained from the cu-
mulative data in Potassium.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have conducted a theoretical study of
the dynamics of Potassium interacting with a high inten-
sity, mid-infrared, short, laser pulse. Potassium, which is
described by a model potential, has been chosen as it was
recently studied experimentally by Sheehy et al. [1]. We
have performed time dependent calculations with both
a direct expansion of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation onto B-Splines, and an expansion into ﬁeld-
free eigenstates within a box, and obtained remarkable
agreement between the two methods. A 12-photon ion-
ization process has been studied, and it was observed that
the low-intensity, power-law behaviour of the ion yield,
has an exponent much lower than the perturbative ex-
pectation of 12. The same behavior was obtained from
the study of a scaled system, namely Hydrogen starting
from the 2s, interacting with a short laser pulse, again
in the 12-photon range. In the 13-photon ionization of
Potassium, we observed a “knee” structure in the ion
yield, and linked it to a similar, more pronounced, be-

10

havior in the excitation. This feature was interpreted
as a broad dynamical resonance with the lowest excita-
tion. The ATI spectra, in all cases that we have stud-
ied, display a clean formation of a plateau in the ﬁrst
peak-heights. Although some discussion exists in the lit-
erature about a plateau in the ATI spectrum at optical
wavelengths, ranging from 2 to 8 times the ponderomo-
tive energy, the existence of a clear low-energy plateau,
has (to the best of our knowledge) not been observed in
other studies in the optical or UV regime, but was mea-
sured in the microwave regime, and interpreted by the
simpleman’s theory of ionization [23]. Through the anal-
ysis of the cumulative data from our simulations, we have
determined the extent of the plateau to scale with the
ponderomotive energy Up as (2.8 ± 0.5)Up, which is com-
patible with the predictions of the classical theory. Given
the much longer wavelength and therefore longer optical
period, an initially launched wavepacket will have more
time to spread before it backscatters from the core. This
raises the question as to weather backscatterring would
play an important role at this wavelength. Recall that
backscattering for shorter wavelengths has been assisci-
ated with changes of the slope of the ATI spectrum up
to around 10 Up. A related question of course is whether
the initally launched wavepacket might be narrower as a
result of which their might not be substantial additional
spreading by the time it reaches the core. A deﬁnitive
evaluation of this aspect would require much more exten-
sive calculations which may be worth undertaking in the
future.

V. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We would like to thank Dr. L. F. DiMauro for sending
us the experimental results [1] prior to publication. Com-
puter time, space and support from the Rechnenzentrum
Garching, and especially John Cox and Dr. R. Volk is
greatfully acknowledged. One of us (P. M.) would like to
thank Dr. L. A. A. Nikolopoulos for useful discussions.

VI. APPENDIX

In the appendix we discuss the model potential used,
by comparing it to the accepted structure of Potassium
and to the alternative frozen core Hartree-Fock model.
The atomic structure of Potassium can be found in sev-
eral places. Since we cannot in a straightforward manner
incorporate relativistic eﬀects in our theory, we use the
weighted energy levels, which are calculated as:

Eav =

1

(2Ji + 1) X

Ji

P
Ji

(2Ji + 1)EJi

(10)

The atomic eigenenergies EJi are taken from [30]. For
easier comparison with the numerical results, we mea-
sure the energies from the ionization threshold which

is at 35009.814 wavenumbers according to Sugar and
Corliss [31].

The multiplet oscillator strengths are calculated using

the approximate formula [32]:

ionization threshold. EExp (cm−1) is the weighted nonrel-
ativistic value, EHF is the Frozen Core Hartree-Fock result,

An alternative approach to the model potential, that
originally seemed appealing, is the Frozen Core Hartree-
Fock method. Its main merit is its ab initio nature, and
the comparatively better description of atomic structure.
Extensive theoretical discussion exists on the Frozen Core
Hartree-Fock method. We used an implementation that
is documented in [34]. The discussion in that paper is
extended towards the application of the method to con-
ﬁguration interaction on the Frozen Core Hartree Fock
basis, while we are only interested in the single outer
electron case. Atomic structure is described quite well,
as we see in the third column of Table (II) where we
show selected bound state energies, and in columns 3 and
4 of Table (III), where we present bound-bound oscilla-
tor strengths in the length and velocity gauge starting
from s, p, and d states respectively. The energies are
measured from the ﬁrst ionization threshold and are ex-
pressed in wavenumbers for direct comparison with the
available data. A 500 a.u. box, with 500 B-Splines of
order 9 was used for the calculations. We notice that
the agreement between oscillator strengths calculated in
the length and velocity gauges is quite good for the cases
displayed in the tables. The major disadvantage of the
method is the inconvenient scaling of the time needed to
calculate the basis, and the actual size of the basis cal-
culated, which limit us to small cases, up to 1000 a.u..
The time needed by the frozen core Hartree Fock scales
as N 4, although in principle it is limited by a N 3 factor.
The size scales with N 2 per angular momentum, so that
for a N = 3000 basis of 20 angular momenta, we need
approximately 2 GB and 35 CPU days in our workstation
cluster to perform the structure calculations. Thus it is
mainly numerical considerations that dictate the use of
the pseudopotential method.

The last columns in tables (II), and (III) are the results
of the Hellmann pseudopotential, as presented in equa-
tion (1), calculated with a box of 2500 a.u., with 2500 B-
Splines of order 9. Since the potential is l-independent,
length and velocity gauge oscillator strengths agree, with-
out the need of introducing a correction to the dipole
operator [35]. We calculated the standard deviation of
the length and velocity absorption oscillator strengths
starting from a speciﬁc state. For all bound states and
up to the lower part of the continuum spectrum, which
is what interests us, this was less than 10−5, which re-
assures us of the completeness of our description. The
model potential represents the atom less accurately than
the Hartree-Fock does, both in terms of energies and os-
cillator strengths. Nevertheless, its excellent numerical
properties, which come from its simplicity, make the large
calculations feasible. Scaling techniques help to map the
model atom results onto real experiments, but our main
aim is to study general features pertaining in the mid-
infrared range, thus making the actual atom used of sec-
ondary importance.

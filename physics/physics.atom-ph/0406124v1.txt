Abstract
We have found recently that, in a supersonic expansion of a mixture of two monoatomic gases,
the parallel temperatures of the two gases can be very diﬀerent. This eﬀect is large if the seeded
gas is highly diluted and if its atomic mass is considerably smaller than the one of the carrier gas.
In the present paper, we present a complete derivation of our theoretical analysis of this eﬀect.
Our calculation is a natural extension of the existing theory of supersonic cooling to the case of
a gas mixture, in the high dilution limit. Finally, we describe a set of temperature measurements
made on a beam of lithium seeded in argon. Our experimental results are in very good agreement
with the results of our calculation.

INTRODUCTION

We have recently reported [1] an unexpected cooling eﬀect in an argon supersonic beam
seeded with a small amount of lithium. The parallel temperature of lithium is smaller than
the parallel temperature of argon and this eﬀect is large, the lithium parallel temperature
being three times smaller than the calculated argon parallel temperature. This eﬀect is
surprising as a common assumption is that the parallel temperatures of the seeded and
carrier gas are roughly equal.

This surprising eﬀect can be explained by an extension of the theory giving the termi-
nal parallel temperature in supersonic beams of pure gases. This theory was developed by
Anderson and Fenn in 1965 [2], by Hamel and Willis [3] in 1966, by Toennies and Winkel-
mann [4] in 1977 and by Beijerinck and Verster [5] in 1981. The case of binary mixtures
was studied theoretically by Anderson and coworkers [6, 7], as well as by other authors who
are quoted by D.R. Miller in his review [8]. The case usually considered corresponds to a
heavy species seeded in a light carrier gas and the early studies established that the terminal
parallel temperatures of the two species are not equal (see ﬁgure 8 of reference [7]), but the
calculated temperature diﬀerence was not very large in this case. The large eﬀect discussed
here exists only for a light seeded species seeded in a heavy carrier gas and, as far as we
know, this situation has not been much studied by theory or by experiment.

The basic phenomenon is due to the exchange of energy between the alkali atoms and
the rare gas atoms. Two eﬀects are important: i) the alkali-rare gas interaction has a longer
range than the rare gas-rare gas interactions so that the expansion cooling goes on for a
longer time for the alkali atoms; ii) the mass ratio plays an important role in the energy
exchange between the two species and, as shown below, the parallel temperature of the
seeded gas (mass m2) is considerably lower than the parallel temperature of the carrier gas
(mass m1) when m2 ≪
The main goal of the present paper is to present a detailed derivation of our theoretical
analysis of this eﬀect. We ﬁrst recall the calculation of the terminal parallel temperature
in a pure gas expansion, discussing the various approximations. Then, we generalize this
calculation to the case of a gas mixture, in the limit of a high dilution and we describe in
detail our approximations. In the ﬁnal part, we present a set of experiments made with a
beam of lithium seeded in argon.

II. TERMINAL PARALLEL TEMPERATURE IN SUPERSONIC EXPANSION
OF A PURE MONOATOMIC GAS

In a ﬁrst step, we follow here the detailed analysis developed by Toennies and Winkelmann
[4] (noted below TW) in 1977, with emphasis on the special case of helium expansion. Then,
we use the approximations introduced by Beijerinck and Verster [5] in 1981 (noted below BV)
to simplify the calculations. Thanks to these approximations, BV were able to demonstrate
analytically a scaling law for the terminal value of the parallel speed ratio.

A. Equations describing the cooling eﬀect during a supersonic expansion

To describe the cooling eﬀect in a supersonic expansion, we must start from the Boltz-

mann equation:

∂t !coll

We have assumed a steady state regime and we have split the phase space particle density
as the product of the density in space n(r) by a normalized velocity distribution f (r, v).
Following TW, the geometry of a supersonic expansion seems impossible to handle in a
fully analytic treatment and near its axis, the expansion is approximated by a spherically
symmetric ﬂow. The solution of the Boltzmann equation is then made by the method of
moments. In this method, the ﬁrst step is to assume that the velocity distribution remains
Maxwellian, but with diﬀerent parallel and perpendicular temperatures Tk and T⊥:

thermal average of the collision integral Q(l), both deﬁned in Appendix A. Tm = (Tk +
2T⊥)/3 is the weighted mean of the parallel and perpendicular temperatures. Finally, the
hydrodynamic velocity u, which appears in equation (12), has been approximated by its
terminal value u∞, given by u∞ =
5kBT0/m in the large Sk∞ limit. Neglecting quantum
eﬀects, if the interaction potential is approximated by a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential, the

pendix A. Finally, we need the value of n(z) which is given by equation (16) and can be

These equations have been integrated numerically by BV and it is easy to reproduce their
calculation (see below ﬁgure 1). An important result is the terminal value of τk, τk∞ =
1.15, from which we deduce the ﬁnal perpendicular temperature as a function of source
parameters:

D. Results, discussion and tests in the case of argon expansion

The tradition is to give the terminal value Sk∞ of the parallel speed ratio rather than the
terminal parallel temperature Tk∞. For completeness, let us recall the relation in the case
of a monoatomic gas:

1 + 0.4S2

The theoretical results of TW and BV have the same form and we have written them in SI

The values of A and δ obtained by TW are A = 1.413 and δ = 0.53, resulting from a
ﬁt to the data obtained by numerical integration of the equations established in part II.A
without approximations. BV obtained A = 1.313 and δ = 0.545. In the range of practical
interest, when 5 < Sk∞ < 50, these two formula never diﬀer by more than 4% and agree for
Sk∞ ≈

Let us discuss the validity of these theoretical results:

•

a basic assumption is the use of the methods of moments, which assumes that the
velocity distribution remains Maxwellian, with diﬀerent parallel and perpendicular
temperatures. As discussed by BV, this assumption is not excellent: at the end of
the expansion, when collisions become rare and when the two temperatures are very
diﬀerent, the velocity distribution for the perpendicular degrees of freedom diﬀers from
a Maxwellian distribution. However, the excellent description of helium expansions

•

by TW proves that the use of this method is a good approximation, at least for the
calculation of the parallel temperature.

with respect to the TW calculations, the BV treatment makes several further approxi-
mations, in particular the linearization expressed by equation (14). The consequences
of these approximations on the results are very minor, as shown by the good agreement
between the TW and BV results.

in both calculations, the temperature dependence of the Ω(2,s) integral is the same,
relying on a scaling law of the cross-section in (C6/kBT )1/3. As pointed out by Miller
[8], the cross-section is thus underestimated in the initial part of the expansion, when
T0 is large. Fortunately, as shown above, in the beginning of the expansion, the
collision term
is very large and its exact value has no importance as long as it is
suﬃcient to maintain Tk = T⊥. It is only when the collisions become rare, i.e. when
the two temperatures start to diﬀer that the exact value of the collision integral Ω(2,s)
is important. Fortunately, this occurs when the parallel temperature reaches 2 or 3
times its ﬁnal value, well in the range where the scaling law (15) is expected to be
good, as discussed in Appendix A.

F

the mathematical form of equation (30) is probably at the origin of a misunderstanding
concerning the terminal value of the speed ratio. In fact, this misunderstanding dates
back from earlier works [2, 3] which expressed the terminal value of the speed ratio as
a function of the Knudsen number calculated at the nozzle. This form suggests that
the terminal speed ratio will increase with the mean number of collisions during the
expansion. This is not true if the cross-section depends rapidly on the temperature:
if one could increase the collision rate near the source temperature without modifying
its value at low temperatures, the total number of collisions will be changed but the
terminal speed ratio will not be modiﬁed.

Using C6(Ar
insist on the C6 value used, which is very close to the best evaluations of this coeﬃcient,
because some authors use an eﬀective value deduced from the core-radius σ and the potential
well depth ǫ using the relation C6 = 4ǫσ6 valid for Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential (see for
example, Miller [8]) and such a value is roughly twice as large. The semi-empirical law of
BV has been compared by Beijerinck, Manger and Verster [9] with the 1969 data of Miller
and Andres [10], the measured speed ratio being clearly lower than the prediction of the
semi-empirical law. The diﬀerence may be probably explained by the interaction with the
residual gas and with the skimmer, as discussed by Buck et al. [11]. We have also compared
this semi-empirical law with measurements made by H. D. Meyer [12]. From this comparison
which is quite satisfactory (except for large values of the source pressure, near the onset of
condensation in the beam), we think that the semi-empirical law of BV is accurate and we
estimate its error bar near

7%.

III. GENERALIZATION TO THE CASE OF A MIXTURE OF TWO
MONOATOMIC GASES

We follow exactly the same derivation as in the previous part. This generalization is
straightforward but the equations are more complex and an analytic solution requires some
further approximations.

A. Approximations used to solve the Boltzmann equation

Still starting from the Boltzmann equation, we have now two equations, one per species

noted i = 1 for the carrier gas and i = 2 for the seeded gas:

grad [ni(r)fi(r, vi)] = Σj=1,2

vi ·

∂ (nifi)

 

∂t !coll

(i, j)

(31)

The collision terms have now two parts corresponding to the two possible types of collision
pairs. The densities fi(r, vi) are expressed by equation (2), with the atomic masses mi, the
temperatures Tki and T⊥i.

We make the approximation that the hydrodynamic velocity u is the same for both
species. This approximation is poor when a very heavy species is seeded in a light gas,
because many collisions are needed to accelerate the heavy species. Here, we are mostly

expansion is well in the supersonic regime, the diﬀerence of the mean velocities is expected
to be very small and the rms parallel velocities will be considerably larger than this small
diﬀerence. We will prove the validity of this approximation below.

A second approximation is to consider only the case of high dilution, i.e. that the seeded
gas density n2 is considerably smaller than the carrier gas density n1. This assumption
greatly simpliﬁes the calculations and the experiments discussed in part IV are well in
n1, in the Boltzmann equation for the carrier gas distribution
this regime. Because n2 ≪
function f1, we can neglect the 1
2 collision term and this simply means that, with an
excellent approximation, the expansion of the carrier gas is not modiﬁed by the presence of
the seeded gas. Therefore, the equations written above can be used to calculate its parallel
and perpendicular temperatures now noted Tk1 and T⊥1, by introducing in Λ(z) the relevant
collision integral Ω(2,2)

1,1 (T ) where the indices designate the colliding atom pair.

−

In the Boltzmann equation for the seeded gas distribution function f2, it is an excellent
approximation to consider only the eﬀect of 1
2 collisions, i.e. collisions with atoms of
the carrier gas and to neglect the collisions involving two atoms of the seeded species 2,
because they are considerably less numerous. Then, using the same procedure and the same
approximations done above, we get the following equations for the temperatures describing
the seeded species:

an obvious consequence of energy conservation makes that, in the pure gas case, all
the energy lost by the parallel degree of freedom appears in the perpendicular degrees
of freedom. Now, the initial energy is shared after the collision between the atoms 1
and 2 and this simple relation does not exist anymore. We can express ∆EX,2 with
the parallel and perpendicular components of the center of mass velocity and of the
relative velocity. However, when the four temperatures (Tki and T⊥i with i = 1, 2) are
not equal, the product f1(v1)f2(v2) does not take a simple form when expressed with
the center of mass velocity and the relative velocity and we have not found how to
calculate exactly the resulting integrals.

B. Coupled equations describing the temperatures of the two gases

The coupled equations for the carrier gas i = 1 are simply the equations established in
part II , equations (18) and (19) where TX is replaced by TX1. In the diﬀerential equations
for the temperatures of the seeded gas i = 2, we have quantities similar to Λ(z) but involving
the Ω(l,2)
1,2 (Tm) integrals with l = 1 and 2. By introducing two dimensionless ratios ρs and ρo,
we can express these quantities as a function of Ω(2,2)
collision
integrals diﬀering by the species of the second collision partner and its value is deduced from
equation (15):

α = m1/M. As in part I.C, we introduce reduced temperatures and a reduced z-coordinate,
by dividing the temperatures by T0 and the distance z by zref and we then eliminate Ξ by

As we have done several approximations and as the calculations are rather involved, it is
interesting to test their coherence. If we assume that the two species have the same masses
(m1 = m2) and the same collision cross-sections (ρs = 1), we expect that the parallel and
perpendicular temperatures are independent of the species at all time. It is easy to derive

identical to ﬁgure 5 of Beijerinck and Verster [5] and the results for τk2 show the anomalous cooling

of the coupled equations supports this idea, although we observe a small diﬀerence on the
terminal values of parallel temperatures, τk2 being 5% lower than τX1 (this weak diﬀerence
is probably due to numerical instabilities).

Numerical integration of equations (42,43) provides the temperatures represented in ﬁgure
1. At the end of the expansion, the parallel and perpendicular temperatures of the seeded
gas are lower than the similar quantities for the carrier gas. In particular, the terminal value
of the parallel temperature ratio τk2,∞/τk1,∞ = Tk2,∞/Tk1,∞ can be substantially lower than
1. The absolute minimum value for this temperature ratio is reached when the right-hand
side of equation (39) vanishes. Assuming that the perpendicular temperatures are both
negligible, we get the minimum possible value of the ratio Tk2,∞/Tk1,∞:

of molecular hydrogen H2 seeded in argon. Usually, molecular hydrogen behaves almost like
an atom in supersonic expansion, because relaxation of molecular rotation is very slow in

11

this case. We have calculated the Ar-H2 C6 coeﬃcient with the combination rule and data of
Kramer and Herschbach [13]. We thus get ρs = 2.48 from which we calculate a temperature

C. Discussion

We may discuss the validity of our derivation. In addition to the approximations already

done by Beijerinck and Verster, we have introduced several new approximations:

•

we have assumed the same hydrodynamic velocity for the two species i.e. we have
neglected the velocity slip, which has been studied by Anderson [6] and by Miller and
Andres [10]. Using the equations (2.37,2.38) of the review paper written by Miller [8]),
we can express the velocity diﬀerence u2,∞ −

u1,∞ with our notations:

In appendix A, we have evaluated the Ω(1,1)
integral, which appears in equations

(2.37,2.38) of reference [8]. We have replaced the mole fraction average mass by its
value m1 in the high dilution limit. The physically important quantity is the ratio

In this form, it is clear that, if the terminal parallel speed ratio Sk1∞ is large, the
velocity slip is a small fraction of the parallel thermal velocity of atom 1, provided
that the masses m1 and m2 are not extremely diﬀerent. In this case, our approximation
is very good.

•

•

we have done the calculation in the high dilution limit: this is not an approximation
but the general case would be interesting to study, for practical applications.

we have treated the products gQ(l)
1,2(g) as constant, in order to be able to handle the
averages of the transferred energy over the elliptic velocity distributions. Takahashi
and Teshima were able to calculate numerically these integrals when they studied the
case of a heavy gas seeded in a light gas [14]. Using the same technique, it would be
possible to test the accuracy of our approximation.

In conclusion, we believe that our approximations are valid and accurate. Numerical
simulation can provide further support to our analytic results. Following P. Skovorodko
[15], several methods can be used to simulate ﬂows of gases and gas mixtures: the Direct
Simulation Monte Carlo method described by G. A. Bird [16] is the best method but it
requires much computation in the high dilution case. P. Skovorodko has used the Test
Particle Monte Carlo method to simulate the expansion of gas mixtures; for computational
needs, this method involves other approximations, in particular the use of Maxwell type
interaction potential. He was able to simulate our lithium seeded in argon expansion and
his results support our calculations, at least at the qualitative level [17].

IV. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Here, we compare our theoretical results with a new set of experiments made on a super-

sonic beam of lithium seeded in argon.

A. Our lithium beam

Our beam [18] is largely inspired by the design used by Broyer, Dugourd and coworkers
to produce lithium clusters [19]. As we need a lithium pressure of the order of 1 millibar
only, we have used Thermocoax heating elements instead of radiative heating. Our oven is
surrounded by two thermal shields, to save heating power, and by a water-cooled copper
shield, to prevent excessive heating of the vacuum tank. The temperatures used in our
experiment are usually equal to 973 K for the back part, corresponding to a lithium vapor
pressure of 0.55 millibar and to 1073 K for the front part. The nozzle is a hole of 200 µm
diameter drilled in a stainless steel 0.3 mm thick wall. The argon gas (from Air Liquide,
99.999 % stated purity) is further puriﬁed by a purifying cartridge also from Air Liquide.

13

The argon pressure can be varied from 150 to 800 millibar. The upper value is limited by
the pumping speed of our pumping system made of a Varian VHS400 oil diﬀusion pump
(8000 l/s pumping speed) backed by a Leybold D65B roughing pump (65 m3/hour pumping
speed). For a source pressure p0 = 300 millibar, the pressure measured near the VHS400
10−4 millibar. We use a skimmer provided by Beam Dynamics; its position is
pump is 8
ﬁxed, while the oven position can be adjusted under vacuum, the nozzle to skimmer distance
being 20 mm. After the skimmer, the lithium beam is in a separate vacuum tank pumped
by a Varian VHS6 oil diﬀusion pump (2400 l/s pumping speed) ﬁtted with a water cooled
baﬄe. Under beam operation, when p0 = 300 millibar, the pressure in this chamber is
10−6 millibar so that the interaction of the beam with the residual gas should not be
6
very large.

×

B. Doppler measurement of the parallel and perpendicular velocity distribution

In the center of the second vacuum tank i.e. 225 mm after the skimmer, the lithium
beam is crossed by two laser beams A and B. The angle between the atomic beam and the
90◦.
laser beams are θA = 47.9

The ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect is sensitive only to the projection vp of the velocity on the
laser beam axis. For a laser beam making the angle θ with the axis of the atomic beam, the
distribution of vp is deduced from equation (2):

with:

T (θ) = Tk cos2 θ + T⊥ sin2 θ
The distribution f (vp) is centered at vp = u cos θ and its width is characterized by a weighted
mean of the parallel and perpendicular temperatures. The ﬂuorescence intensity as a func-
tion of the laser frequency reﬂects very accurately the velocity distribution if two conditions
are fulﬁlled:

(48)

the natural width of the excited transition is negligible with respect to the Doppler
width

saturation broadening of the transition as well as laser frequency jitter are both neg-
ligible.

Our laser excites the hyperﬁne components of the 2S1/2 - 2P3/2 resonance transition of
lithium at 671 nm [20]. The very small hyperﬁne splittings of the upper state can be
neglected. The ground state has two hyperﬁne components F = 1 and F = 2, with a
splitting equal to 803.5 MHz. The natural width of the transition is Γ/2π = 5.87 MHz [21]
and we use laser power density of the order of 10−2 mW/cm2, corresponding to a saturation
10−3 and a negligible broadening of the excitation line. The laser used
parameter s
is a single frequency cw dye laser pumped by a Spectra-Physics argon ion laser, the dye
being LD 688 from Exciton dissolved in EPH. Using the H¨ansch-Couillaud [22] frequency
stabilization technique, we get a laser linewidth of the order of 1 MHz.

We have recorded a series of laser induced ﬂuorescence spectra for diﬀerent argon pressures
in the beam source. Figure 3 shows such a spectrum. The observed Doppler widths fall in the

14

−

120 MHz range, for beam B, which is sensitive to the parallel velocity distribution: the
90
natural width as well as the laser linewidth are clearly negligible. During our experiment,
we have also recorded a saturated absorption spectrum in a heat pipe oven: this signal
provides Doppler-free peaks which are useful if one wants to measure accurately the mean
velocity u of the atomic beam, because, in some experiments, the laser beam B is not exactly
perpendicular to the atomic beam.

C. Experimental results

The analysis of a ﬂuorescence spectrum provides various information collected in table
IV C for various sources pressures. From the distance between the A and B peaks, we can
deduce the beam mean velocity u. The measured values are close to u = 1010
10 m/s,
±
slightly less than the value deduced from the source temperature, u∞ =
5kBT0/m = 1056
m/s. The width of the B peak is related to the perpendicular temperature of the beam:
we think that the perpendicular temperature T⊥ thus deduced is overestimated because our
detector is not observing only one streamline. The width of the A peaks provide the weighted
mean T (θ) of the temperatures, from which we can deduce the parallel temperature. As

we think that our measurement may overestimate the perpendicular temperature, we have
neglected the contribution of the perpendicular temperature when extracting the parallel
temperature from T (θ), i.e. we have used:

Tk = T (θ)/ cos2 θ

(49)

so that we get an upper limit of the parallel temperature Tk. In table IV C, we have also given
the ﬂuorescence signal intensity in arbitrary units, as it gives an idea of the intensity of the
lithium beam. The intensity decreases when the argon pressure increases. This behavior,
which is not expected, may indicate some interaction of the beam with the residual gas,
probably near the skimmer. The measured parallel temperature is plotted as a function
of argon pressure in ﬁgure 4. We have also plotted the predicted theoretical dependence
Tk2 = 0.31
Tk1, where Tk1 is given by equations (29) and (30), using the semi-empirical
coeﬃcients of BV. The factor 0.31 which is the result of our theoretical calculation explains
quite well our observations as long as the argon pressure is smaller than 400 millibar. For
larger pressures, the parallel temperature remains constant while the theory predicts that
it should still decrease. We tentatively assume that this discrepancy may be due to the
interaction of the beam with the residual gas discussed above.

×

We will not recall here the data obtained by D. Pritchard and coworkers [23, 24] with a
beam of sodium seeded in argon: this data, which has already been discussed in our previous
paper [1], is also in agreement with our theoretical analysis.

V. CONCLUSION

In a previous letter [1], we have given a ﬁrst evidence and a brief theoretical explanation of
a new anomalous cooling eﬀect, which appears in a supersonic expansion, when a light atom
is seeded in an heavier carrier gas. The present paper has completed this letter by describing
the details of our theoretical analysis and by presenting a larger set of experimental data.

We have ﬁrst recalled and discussed the theoretical calculation of the parallel temperature
in supersonic expansions of a pure monoatomic gas. In a second step, we have described in
detail our extension of this theory to supersonic expansions of a mixture of two monoatomic
gases, in the high dilution limit. In particular, we have explained the approximations we
have made to get analytical equations for the parallel and perpendicular temperatures of

FIG. 4: The parallel temperature of lithium seeded in argon as a function of argon pressure
in the source. The points represent our measurements while the full curve is the result of our
theoretical calculation Tk2 = 0.31Tk1, where the argon parallel temperature is given by the semi-
empirical law of Beijerinck and Verster. The agreement between theory and experiment is quite
good when the argon pressure is below 400 millibar but, for larger source pressures, the lithium
parallel temperature remains roughly constant, in disagreement with theory.

the seeded gas. We have integrated numerically the diﬀerential equations describing the
parallel and perpendicular temperatures of the seeded gas and we have shown that these
equations predict a large diﬀerence of terminal parallel temperatures for the carrier and
seeded gases. The ratio of these two temperatures depends on several parameters, namely
the ratio of the atomic masses of the two species and the ratio of their collision cross-sections
at low temperature. We have deduced the lowest possible value of the temperature ratio
Tk2∞/Tk1∞: this ratio may be quite small when a light species is seeded in a heavy species
with m2 ≪
In a last part, we have described a new set of measurements of the parallel velocity distri-
bution of a supersonic beam of lithium seeded in argon, with a high dilution. The measured
lithium parallel temperature is considerably lower than the calculated parallel temperature
of the argon beam and the temperature ratio is in good agreement with our theoretical
prediction, at least when the argon pressure is not too large. The deviation between theory
and experiment, which appears at large argon pressures, is tentatively attributed to some
interaction of the beam with the residual gas near the skimmer.

m1.

We think that the anomalous cooling eﬀect described here is now well established. Several
further studies would be very interesting. First of all, it should be easy to observe this eﬀect
in several simple experimental cases, a particularly striking one being molecular hydrogen
seeded in argon. From the theoretical point of view, it should be possible to investigate
this eﬀect by other methods, including numerical simulation, and to estimate the eﬀect of a

17

ﬁnite dilution.

As far as we know, this eﬀect remained undetected up-to-now because it is rather unusual
to seed a light atom in an heavier carrier gas. An other and very general interest of the
present study is to emphasize that a supersonic expansion is not in thermal equilibrium and
that some unexpected eﬀects may result.

VII. APPENDIX A: WEIGHTED CROSS-SECTIONS; THEIR DEFINITION
AND CALCULATION OF THEIR TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE

A. Deﬁnitions

We consider the collision between two atoms of species i and j with a relative velocity g
and a reduced mass µ. The deﬁnitions and many results are taken from the book Molecular
theory of gases and liquids, by Hirschfelder, Curtiss and Bird [25]. Starting from the dif-
ferential cross-section dσi,j(g)/dΩ, the angle-weighted cross-sections Q(l)
i,j(g) are deﬁned by

where χ is the deﬂection angle. In classical mechanics, the deﬂection angle χ is a function

The validity of classical mechanics to describe the collision at low energies may be ques-
tioned. Three circumstances contribute to make classical mechanics a good approximation
in the experimental cases considered here:

•

the quantum character of the interaction between two atoms is usually measured by
the quantum parameter η = ¯h2/(mσ2ǫ) introduced by Stwalley and Nosanow [26] (see
also De Boer and Lunbeck [27]) where ǫ is the potential well depth and σ the core

the diﬀerential cross-section presents several types of quantum eﬀects. These eﬀects
are largely reduced by the angle average following equation (50) and further reduced
by the thermal average following equation (52).

a quantum eﬀect which survives these two averages is the behaviour of the cross-
section at extremely low energy, in the quantum threshold regime. Following Julienne
and Mies [28], this regime extends up to an energy of the order of ¯h3µ−3/2C −1/2
for
an potential with a C6/r6 long range. For instance, the quantum threshold eﬀect ex-
plains the large increase of the helium-helium cross-section calculated by Toennies and
Winkelmann. For argon-argon and lithium-argon collisions, using the C6 of reference
[32], we ﬁnd that this regime could be observed for temperatures of the order of 10−2
10−2 Kelvin respectively, well below the lowest temperatures obtained in argon
and 2
expansions, of the order of 1 Kelvin [5, 12].

using the usual reduced quantities (see paragraph 8.2 of [25]).
In a ﬁrst step, we have
calculated the deﬂection function χ(b) as a function of the reduced energy E∗ = µg2/(2ǫ),
by numerical integration. Our calculation reproduces well the analytic deﬂection function of
BV for E∗
0.1 (see [5], appendix A), but the shape of this function varies with the energy
and in particular, if E∗ > 0.8, the orbiting singularity disappears.

We have then calculated the Q(l)(g) cross-sections with l = 1 and l = 2 as a function of
E∗. In the low-energy range, E∗
1, these two cross-sections are well approximated by
an (E∗)−1/3 behavior and, to make this behavior very clear, we have plotted in ﬁgure 5 the
variation of Q(l)(g)E∗1/3 as a function of E∗. At low energy, our calculation presents a small
numerical noise associated to the orbiting singularity. We have not tried to reduce this noise
by introducing some analytic approximations of the function χ(b) near this singularity.

has already been introduced. The z axis is parallel to the hydrodynamic velocity and, to
simplify the geometry, we may choose the x and y axis so that the initial relative velocity
g lies in the yz plane, making an angle θ with the z axis. However, this choice complicates
the following part of the calculation as it creates a correlation between the x-components
of v1 and v2. We may eliminate this unphysical correlation by expressing the results as a
function of the parallel and perpendicular components of the initial velocities, without any
reference to their x,y components.

The relative velocity after the collision is noted gf . The deﬂection angle noted χ is the
angle between g and gf . We must also introduce the azimuth ϕ measuring the orientation
in space of the plane g, gf . This azimuth ϕ is equally probable in the 0
ϕ < 2π range.

ones with i = j and X = Y and their values are simply related to the temperature
associated to this atom and this degree of freedom. We thus obtain:

we must ﬁnally integrate over the angle χ. The integrals involve the angular weights
(1
1,2 deﬁned by
equation (50). There was no terms involving l = 1 terms in the pure gas case. This
new feature is due to the fact that the forward-backward symmetry existing in the
pure gas case is now broken by the diﬀerent masses of the two colliding atoms and by
the fact that we calculate the energy transfer for atom 2 only.

1,2 and Q(2)

we have made an approximation by considering gQ(l)
1,2(g) as independent of g and we
must ﬁx its value. To be coherent with the pure gas case, we have made the same
approximation in the pure gas case and we have identiﬁed the equations thus obtained
with equations (14). We thus get:

In our calculations, we have used Tm = (Tk1 + 2T⊥1)/3, which might not be the best
choice. However, as Ω(l,2)
m , we think that the exact
choice for Tm has little inﬂuence on the result.

1,2 (Tm) varies very slowly, like T 1/6

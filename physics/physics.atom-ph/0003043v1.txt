The lowest bound states of the hydrogen negative ion and negative donor systems in a homo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld are investigated theoretically via a full conﬁguration interaction approach
with an anisotropic Gaussian basis set. The broad magnetic ﬁeld regime γ = 8 · 10−4
− 4 · 103 is
covered. Nonrelativistic total energies, electron detachment energies and transition wavelengths are
presented assuming an inﬁnite nuclear mass. The binding mechanisms are discussed in detail. The
accuracy for the energies is enhanced signiﬁcantly compared to previously published data.

I. INTRODUCTION

The term “strong ﬁeld” characterizes a situation for which the Lorentz force is of the order of magnitude or
greater than the Coulomb binding force. For a hydrogen atom in the ground state the corresponding ﬁeld strength
cannot be reached in the laboratory, but only in astrophysical objects like white dwarfs ( B≈ 102–105T) or neutron
stars ( B≈ 107–109T). Astrophysicists possess therefore a vivid interest in the behavior and properties of matter in
strong magnetic ﬁelds: theoretically calculated data of magnetized atoms can be used for the determination of the
decomposition and magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of astrophysical objects [1–4]. On the other hand the strong magnetic
ﬁeld regime is accessible in the laboratory if one considers highly excited Rydberg states of e.g. atoms [5,6].

In solid state physics donor states in semiconductors with parabolic conduction bands are systems which possess
a Hamiltonian equivalent to the one of hydrogen within an eﬀective mass approximation. Due to screening eﬀects
the Coulomb force is much weaker than in the case of hydrogen. The regime where the ground state of the system is
dominated by magnetic forces can therefore be reached for certain semiconductors in the laboratory. As an example
we mention GaAs for which the eﬀective mass is m∗ = 0.067 me and the static dielectric constant ǫs = 12.53 ǫ0. Since
the Hamiltonian of the atomic ion and the negative donor are connected through a scaling transformation the values
for the energies given in the present work hold for both systems equally. The reader should however keep in mind
that they are given in diﬀerently scaled units.

Apart from the above atoms and molecules in strong magnetic ﬁelds are also of interest from a pure theoretical
point of view. Due to the competition of the spherically symmetric Coulomb potential and the cylindrically symmetric
magnetic ﬁeld interaction we encounter a nonseparable, nonintegrable problem. Perturbation theory, which is possible
in the weak and in the ultrastrong ﬁeld regime, breaks down in the intermediate ﬁeld regime. It is therefore necessary
to develop new techniques to solve such problems. The neutral hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld is now
understood to a high degree (see [5,7] and references therein). Recently Kravchencko has published an “exact”
solution which provides an inﬁnite double sum for the eigenvalues [8]. With the presented method all energy values
of bound states could in principle be calculated to arbitrary precision.

For two electron atoms the situation is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The problems posed by the electron-electron interac-
tion and the non-separability on the one-particle level have to be solved simultaneously, which is much harder. The
H− ion provides an additional challenge since correlation plays an important role for its binding properties. With-
out a ﬁeld it possesses only one bound state [9]. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld and for the assumption of an
inﬁnitely heavy nucleus it could be shown [10] that there exists an inﬁnite number of bound states. For laboratory
ﬁeld strengths these states are, due to the binding mechanism via a one dimensional projected polarization potential,
very weakly bound [11]. Some ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects can be included via scaling relations [7,12,14]. However, the
inﬂuence of the center of mass motion has not been investigated in detail so far. In the present work we assume an
inﬁnitely heavy nucleus which represents a good approximation for the slow H− atomic ion in strong magnetic ﬁelds
and describes simultaneously the situation of negatively charged donors D− in the ﬁeld. Relativistic corrections were
neglected since they are assumed to be small compared to the electron detachment energy of the system. We will
use in the following the spectroscopic notation 2S+1M for the electronic states of the ion where M and S are the
total magnetic and spin quantum numbers. Since states with negative z-parity are not considered here we omit the
corresponding label in our notation (see also section II A).

Many authors have tackled the quantum mechanical problem of H− in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. One of the ﬁrst,
who pursued a variational approach to this problem, were Henry et al. [15]. They give ﬁrst qualitative insights into
the weak and intermediate ﬁeld regime. Mueller et al. [16] qualitatively described the strong ﬁeld ground state 3(−1)
and the 10 state for high ﬁelds (γ ≈ 4 to γ ≈ 20 000, where γ = 1 a. u. corresponds to 2.3554 · 105T).

Larsen has published a number of papers on this problem [17–19]. On the one hand he created very simple and
physically motivated trial functions with only a small number of variational parameters. On the other hand his
energies were “state of the art” in variational calculations for a long time. In [17] he provides binding energies of the
lowest 10 state in the ﬁeld regime γ = 0 − 5 and of the 3(−1) state in the regime γ = 0 − 3. He also presents ﬁgures
showing the binding energies of the singlet and triplet state for M = −2 and M = −3. Later [19] he presents total
and electron detachment energies for the lowest 10, 3(−1) and 3(−2) state in the high ﬁeld regime. More speciﬁcally
the regime γ = 20 − 1 000 for the 3(−1) state and γ = 20 − 200 for the other states were investigated. Furthermore
Park and Starace [20] provided upper and lower bounds for energies and binding energies of the ground state 10 for
weak ﬁelds.

In the nineties several authors [21–24] improved the accuracy of the binding energies and total energies by new
techniques. Vincke and Baye [21] report total ionization energies for the lowest singlet and triplet states with M =
0, −1 and −2 for a few ﬁeld strengths in the regime γ = 4 − 400. They are to our knowledge the ﬁrst who reported
that the 1(−1) state becomes bound for suﬃciently high ﬁeld strengths and realized that the 1(−2) state is slightly
stronger bound than the corresponding triplet state in the high ﬁeld regime. Larsen and McCann present in [22]
one-particle binding energies for the 10 state in the broad magnetic ﬁeld regime γ = 0 − 200. In [23] the same authors
consider furthermore the singlet and triplet states of M = −1, −2. The triplet states are calculated for γ = 0.5 − 200,
the 1(−1) state in the ﬁeld regime γ = 55 − 2 000 and the 1(−2) state is calculated for a few ﬁeld strength in the
range γ = 1 − 100. Blinowski and Szwacka [24] have subsequently used a Gaussian basis set, similar to the one used
in our calculation. They present results for the 10 state, which are less accurate than those of ref. [22].

We also mention some Hartree–Fock calculations: very early Virtamo [25] has investigated the ground state energies
from γ ≈ 20 to γ ≈ 20 000. Thurner et al. [26] (results published in [7]) have calculated triplet states for M =−1,−2
and −3 for many ﬁeld strength in the broad range γ = 2·10−4 −2·103. However since they use spherical wave functions
for weak ﬁelds and cylindrical ones for high ﬁelds, there remains a gap of inaccurate results in the intermediate ﬁeld
regime.

In the present investigation we provide lower variational energies and higher one-particle binding energies for the
atomic H− problem and respectively the negatively charged donor center D− problem in a strong magnetic ﬁeld
compared to all other published data sofar. An exception is the ﬁeld free situation: the calculation by Pekeris [27]
gives −0.52775 a.u.
for the ground state binding energy whereas we obtain −0.5275488 a.u. Clearly the ﬁeld-free
situation is much better understood than the case of a strong ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II we consider the symmetries of the Hamiltonian and the basis set we
use in our calculations. In section III we will report on the strategy we employed for the selection of basis functions
in order to obtain accurate results. Section IV contains the discussion of our results and a comparison with the
literature.

II. HAMILTONIAN, SYMMETRIES AND BASIS SET

A. Hamiltonian and Symmetries

In the following we assume an inﬁnite nuclear mass (ﬁxed donor). The magnetic ﬁeld is chosen to point along the

z-direction. The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian takes in atomic units the form

H = H1 + H2 +

1

|r1 − r2|

with

Hi =

i +

p

γlzi +

γ2
8

(cid:0)x2

i + y2

i (cid:1) −

1
|ri|

+ γszi.

(2.1)

(2.2)

The Hamiltonian is splitted in its one-particle operators, where 1/2γlzi is the Zeeman term, γ2/8 (cid:0)x2
i (cid:1) is the
diamagnetic term, −1/ |ri| is the attractive Coulomb interaction with the nucleus (donor) and γszi the spin Zeeman
term (we take the g-factor equal 2). The two-particle operator 1/ |r1 − r2| represents the repulsive electron-electron
interaction.

i + y2

The Hamiltonian (2.1) possesses four independent symmetries and associated quantum numbers: the total spin S2,
the total z-projection of the spin Sz, the z-component of the total angular momentum M and the total z-parity Πz
(parity is also conserved but not a further independent symmetry).

2

B. One-particle basis set

For our calculation we use an anisotropic Gaussian basis set, which has been put forward by Schmelcher and
Cederbaum in ref. [28], for the purpose of investigating atoms and molecules in strong magnetic ﬁelds. It has already
successfully been applied to helium [12,13], H+

2 [29] and H2 [30].

Adapted to the problem discussed here this one-particle basis set for the spatial part reads in the cylindrical

coordinates as follows

Φi(ρ, φ, z) = ρnρi znzi e−αiρ2−βiz2

exp(imiφ).

(2.3)

These functions are eigenfunctions of the symmetry operations of the one-particle Hamiltonian Hi, i.e. eigenfunctions
of lz and πz. The additional parameters nρi and nzi obey the following restrictions:

nρi = |mi| + 2ki;
nzi = πzi + 2li;

ki = 0, 1, 2, . . .
li = 0, 1, 2, . . .

and mi = . . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .
and πzi = 0, 1.

(2.4)
(2.5)

The exponents αi and βi serve as positive, nonlinear variational parameters. Due to these parameters, the one-particle
functions are ﬂexible enough to be adapted to the situation of an arbitrary ﬁeld strength: in the weak magnetic ﬁeld
regime a basis set with an almost isotropic choice of parameters αi ≈ βi describes the slightly perturbed spherical
symmetry. For very high magnetic ﬁelds it is appropriate to choose α = γ/4 since ρ|mi| exp(−γ/4 ρ2) yields the
ρ-dependence of the lowest Landau level for a given magnetic quantum number. The βi will be well tempered in a
wide region. In the intermediate ﬁeld regime the basis is composed of functions with certain magnetic ﬁeld dependent
sets of {αi, βi} which mediate the extreme cases. The optimal choice is found by searching the set of {αi, βi} which
yields the lowest eigenvalues of the one-particle Hamiltonian. The parameters {αi,βi} are successively optimized using
the pattern search algorithm. In this manner we have optimized up to ﬁve excited states in every symmetry subspace.
The starting values for the parameters {αi, βi} have to be chosen very carefully to ﬁnd a deep local or even the global
minimum. Since the search in this high dimensional space is very time consuming, an optimal choice of the ki and li
is crucial: for every new ki, li conﬁguration a new optimization procedure has to be started. The resulting binding
energies for the neutral hydrogen atom were identical to 7 – 9 digits with the one given in [8] for almost all ﬁeld
strengths for the ground state and 5 – 7 digits were recovered for states with higher magnetic quantum number |mi|.
We point out that Blinowski and Szwacka [24] have used a similar basis set, but without the monomers ρ2ki and

z2li. The additional monomers however decisively enhance the ﬂexibility and accuracy of the calculations.

C. Two-particle conﬁgurations

As a next step we build two-particle conﬁgurations from our optimized one-particle basis set and represent the
Hamiltonian (2.1) in this conﬁguration space. This is done for each total symmetry (S2, Πz, Lz) separately. The
corresponding spectrum of H− is then obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix. We hereby use all possible
excited two-particle conﬁgurations constructed from our optimized one-particle basis set, i.e. our approach is a full
conﬁguration interaction method (full CI). The two-particle functions are constructed from the one-particle functions
by selecting combinations for mi + mj = M and πzi + πzj = Πz. The spin part can be trivially separated. Due to the
antisymmetrization of the spatial wave function the conﬁguration space of the triplet states is slightly smaller than
that of the singlet states since for triplet conﬁgurations there are no combinations with i = j.

As our basis set is not orthogonal we have to solve a ﬁnite-dimensional generalized real symmetric eigenvalue

problem

(H − ES) · c = 0

(2.6)

where H is the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian and S the overlap matrix. The resulting energies E are
strict upper bounds to the exact eigenvalues in the given subspace of symmetries.

Some technical remarks concerning the calculation of the matrix elements are in order. All matrix elements can
be evaluated analytically. With the exception of the electron-electron integrals all expressions can be calculated
very rapidly. The electron-electron integrals, however, deserve a special treatment: through a combination of trans-
formation techniques as well as analytical continuation formulae for the series of involved transcendental functions
their representation has been simpliﬁed enormously (for details see ref. [12] and in particular [13]). It is due to this
extremely eﬃcient implementation of the electron-electron integral that large basis sets of the order of 2500 − 4000
could be used in the present work to perform CI calculations for many ﬁeld strengths.

III. SELECTION OF THE BASIS FUNCTIONS

Since the single bound state in the absence of the external ﬁeld is bound only due to correlation, and all the
other states in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld are only weakly bound, it is very important to include correlation
by a proper choice of the one-particle basis functions building up the two-particle conﬁgurations. For the M = 0
singlet state this was achieved by selecting one-particle basis functions not only with m1 = m2 = 0 but also with
m1 = −m2 6= 0. This allows one to describe the angular correlation which is particular important for the 10 state.
In general the enhanced binding properties of negative ions in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld are due to a balanced
competition of the diﬀerent interactions. On the one hand the conﬁnement due to the magnetic ﬁeld raises the kinetic
energy and the electrostatic repulsion due to the electron-electron interaction. These eﬀects tend to lower the binding
energy. On the other hand the conﬁnement raises the nuclear attraction energy, the exchange energy and to some
extent also the correlation energy which tend to enhance the binding energy. Of course one has to distinguish between,
for example, the 10 state whose binding properties are dominated by correlation eﬀects and the excited bound states
with nonzero magnetic quantum numbers which possess a signiﬁcant contribution to their binding energy through
exchange eﬀects and due to the occupation of the series of tightly bound hydrogenic orbitals 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2,. . . etc.

For the description of the lowest states with |M | > 0 an eﬀective one-particle picture can be employed [17]: the
hydrogen negative ion consists of a tightly bound core electron with magnetic quantum number zero and a signiﬁcantly
less bound electron which carries the magnetic quantum number of the ion. The core electron is then described by
one-particle basis functions with m1 = 0. The outer electron is described by one-particle functions with m2 = M in
order to take into account the fact that it is weakly bound and thus spatially extended. In order to go beyond this
eﬀective one-particle picture we used, similar to the case M = 0 one-particle functions with other magnetic quantum
numbers to obtain in particular the correlation behavior.

The above picture is not valid for the tightly bound states in the high ﬁeld regime: the number of functions with
diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers can be reduced as we increase the ﬁeld strength. This reduction in the number
of basis functions is also suggested by the occurrence of linear dependencies for strong ﬁelds. The extent of this
reduction can be seen from the fact that the number of two-particle basis functions drops from 4 000 for γ = 0 to less
than 3 000 for γ = 4000 for the 10 state.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As already mentioned the H− ion possesses only one bound state in the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld [9]. Turning
on the ﬁeld it has been shown [10] that there exists (for inﬁnite nuclear mass) for any nonzero ﬁeld an inﬁnite number
of bound states. The corresponding proof [10] relies on the physical picture [11] that the external electron is for weak
ﬁelds far from the neutral atomic core and experiences therefore to lowest order a polarization potential due to the
induced dipole moment of the core. Perpendicular to the ﬁeld the motion of the external electron is dominated by
the ﬁeld and it occupies approximately Landau orbitals whereas parallel to the ﬁeld it is weakly bound due to the
projection of the mentioned polarization potential on the Landau orbitals which yields an one-dimensional binding
along the ﬁeld. For typical strong laboratory ﬁelds the corresponding binding energies are of the order of 10−6 eV
for the hydrogen atom negative ion and signiﬁcantly larger for more electron atoms with a larger polarizability. To
investigate theses states in the weak ﬁeld regime goes clearly beyond the feasibility of the present method. Instead we
will investigate a number of states, starting from the value of the ﬁeld strength for which they become signiﬁcantly
bound, which means that the outer electron is already relatively close to the core and possesses a binding energy of
at least a few meV. Clearly in that case the picture of the polarization potential is no more valid since exchange and
correlation eﬀects rule the binding properties of the ion. Within our approach we could ﬁnd one bound state for each
negative magnetic quantum number of the ion considered (−3 ≤ M ≤ 0) for both singlet and triplet states, except the
30 state, which is unbound. Their behavior has been studied for the complete range of ﬁeld strengths 0.01 ≤ γ ≤ 4000.
The one bound state of the H− ion in the absence of the ﬁeld represents, in the above sense, an exception since it is
already signiﬁcantly bound without the ﬁeld. All these states possess positive z-parity and no bound states could be
found for negative z-parity.

A. Threshold energies

The electron detachment energy is deﬁned to be the energy we need to remove one electron from the atom without
changing the quantum numbers of the total system. The corresponding lowest threshold energy ET for the H− ion
can be expressed as:

4

ET =

γ
2

(|M | + M + 2 + geMs) − I(H)

(4.1)

where I(H) is the binding energy of the ground state of the neutral hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld. The term
γ/2(|M |+M +2) is the energy of an electron in the lowest Landau level with magnetic quantum number m = M where
the spin part is omitted. This means that the free electron carries the whole angular momentum of the state. For
magnetic quantum numbers M ≤ 0 the threshold energy ET is independent of the angular momentum M , i.e. there is
only a singlet and a triplet threshold. The threshold energy is then ET = γ − I(H) for singlet states and ET = −I(H)
for triplet states. We denote the electron detachment energy by I(H −) which is given by I(H−) = ET − Etot where
Etot is the total energy of the considered state of H−.

B. Total, electron detachment and transition energies

Before we discuss the individual states and their properties let us describe some general features of the states
considered here. The total energy of the singlet states is monotonically increasing with increasing ﬁeld strength. This
fact is caused by the increase of the ﬁeld-dependent kinetic energy. In contrast to this the total energy of the triplet
states is monotonically decreasing with increasing ﬁeld strengths. This is a consequence of the additional spin Zeeman
term (we consider here only the Sz = −1 component of the spin triplet states). The electron detachment energies
are monotonically increasing with increasing ﬁeld strength for all states considered here, i.e. both singlet and triplet
states. This has to be seen in view of the above-mentioned fact that the zero-point kinetic (Landau) energy of the
electrons is raised in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld and therefore the threshold energy for loosing one electron is
raised in the same way.

For the 10 state the total energy raises from −0.52754875 at γ = 0 to 3986.49870 at γ = 4000. This state is the
most tightly bound state for all ﬁeld strengths. The detachment energy increases from 0.027549 a.u. at γ = 0 to
2.29805 a.u. at γ = 4000. There are two reason which give rise to the fact, that this state is the most tightly bound
one. On the one hand the electrons are in this state much closer to the nucleus than in other states. This increases
the binding due to the attractive nuclear potential energy. On the other hand correlation has an important impact
on the binding energy. Both eﬀects are reinforced with increasing ﬁeld strength as the electrons become more an
more conﬁned in the x-y plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. These eﬀects overcome the inﬂuence of the static
electron-electron repulsion. The total energies and the detachment energies of the 10 state are presented in table I.
It can be seen that the detachment energies for this most tightly bound state could be improved by 1-2% for all ﬁeld
strengths compared to the existing literature. This is not correct for a vanishing ﬁeld, where much more eﬃcient basis
sets like the Hylleraas basis set are available. For numerical reasons the relative accuracy for the detachment energies
is largest in the intermediate ﬁeld regime.

The 30 state is not bound for all considered ﬁeld strengths. This can be understood in an eﬀective particle
picture as follows: for triplet states the spatial two-particle wave function is antisymmetric with respect to particle
exchange and therefore the two particles have to occupy diﬀerent spatial orbitals, i.e. we are exclusively dealing
with excited conﬁgurations. For M 6= 0 it is (see later) possible to obtained tightly bound triplet states in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld by occupying diﬀerent orbitals of the hydrogenic series (1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, . . .) which yields the one-particle
excited conﬁgurations of the type 1s2p−1, 1s3d−2, . . .. For the case of the 30 state, however, we have M = 0 and
only conﬁgurations constructed from pairs of two orbitals with (m, −m) are allowed which are either of doubly
excited character (m 6= 0) or a singly excited conﬁguration with m = 0. Therefore no magnetically tightly bound
conﬁgurations are allowed for the 30 state which illuminates its unbound character for any ﬁeld strength. All singlet
and triplet electron detachment energies of all the considered bound states are presented also graphically: Figure 1
shows the singlet detachment energies and ﬁgure 2 the corresponding energies for the triplet states.

It is important to mention that the global ground state of the ion undergoes a crossover with respect to its symmetry
with increasing ﬁeld strength. For weak ﬁelds the 10 state is the ground state of the system, whereas in strong ﬁelds
the 3(−1) state becomes the ground state which was ﬁrst shown in ref. [15]. This is caused by the spin Zeeman
term, which lowers the total energy of the triplet states. The crossover takes place at γc ≈ 0.05 which corresponds
to approximately 104 T for the H− ion. The 3(−1) state is very weakly bound when it becomes the ground state
(at γc the detachment energy is ≈ 3 · 10−4 a.u.). This prevents us from localizing more exactly the ﬁeld strength at
which the crossover takes place. The 3(−1) state, being the ground state of the anion for γ > γc never becomes the
most tightly bound state. At γ = 4 000 its electron detachment energy is 1.25 a.u. and therefore much less than the
detachment energy of the 10 state. This is due to the fact that the tightly bound states are formed by occupying the
hydrogenic series 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, . . . (as mentioned above) and the 10 states allows for the 1s2 conﬁguration yielding
the strongest binding although it represents an excited state for γ > γc due to its spin character.

The singlet state 1(−1) is not bound for weak ﬁelds.

It becomes bound in the regime γ ≈ 1 − 5 which is an
unexpected behavior. The 1(−1) state lies higher in the spectrum than the bound 1(−2) and 1(−3) states for the

5

intermediate ﬁeld region. In the high ﬁeld region it however crosses both states. The crossing with the 1(−3) takes
place at γ ≈ 300, the crossing with the 1(−2) state is at γ & 4 000. Unfortunately the accuracy of our method is
not suﬃcient to provide a closer look at this crossing. The fact that the 1(−1) state is not bound for weak ﬁelds
but bound for strong ﬁelds is a consequence of the complicated interplay of the diﬀerent interactions. The Coulomb
repulsion of the two electrons is much weaker for the spatially antisymmetric triplet states compared to the singlet
states. The electron-electron repulsion is higher for the states with M = −1 compared to the states with M < −1.
This pushes the |M | = 1 singlet states for weak ﬁelds beyond the threshold energy, i.e. makes them unbound. The
total ionization and the detachment energies of the singlet and triplet states with M = −1 are presented in table II.
The suppression of the binding for the singlet state can clearly be seen from this table: the detachment energy of the
singlet is 100 times lower than for the triplet at γ = 10, but at γ = 4000 the ratio is of the order 2. The comparison
with the literature (see table II) shows that our detachment energies are variationally lower by several percent than
the best available data. For the situation of weakly bound states the improvement is signiﬁcantly larger.

Let us now consider the energies for the states with M = −2 which are presented in table III. Focusing on the
detachment energies we realize that for weak ﬁelds the triplet state possesses a larger detachment energy than the
singlet state, but for intermediate and high ﬁelds the singlet state is stronger bound than the triplet one, i.e. we
encounter a crossover which is presented in ﬁgure 3. Compared to the data of ref. [23], our method yields 5 − 10%
higher variational detachment energies for the triplet state and several times higher detachment energies for the
singlet one. If we consider the singlet-triplet splitting which is the diﬀerence of the total energies between the singlet
and the triplet state, where the spin-Zeeman shift is omitted, it can be observed, that for all states this splitting
behaves monotonically increasing with increasing ﬁeld strength in the weak ﬁeld regime. The splitting for the states
with M = −2 and M = −3 are shown in ﬁgure 4. The splitting for the M = −2 states increases in weak ﬁelds,
but for high ﬁelds this splitting decreases and becomes negative above some critial ﬁeld strength. It seems that the
Coulomb repulsion, due to antisymmetrization of the wave function is dominated by correlation eﬀects. That the
above observation is in fact a consequence of correlation is supported by Vincke and Baye [21]: the reversed order
concerning the detachment energies (see ﬁgure 3) occurs if they include so-called transverse mixing, which simulates
correlations in their approach.

For states with M = −3 only a few published data are available. These states are only weakly bound, although
they are stronger bound for γ & 300 than the 1(−1) state. The singlet state has for γ = 0.2 a detachment energy of
7.1 10−5 a.u. and at γ = 1000 its detachment energy is 0.19. The electron detachment energies of the triplet state
are of the same order of magnitude and the absolute value of the singlet triplet splitting is the lowest of the states
considered here. As a consequence a careful convergence study of the results (detachment energy) is indispensable.
Our data are given in table IV.

The wavelengths of the transitions of the singlet states are presented in ﬁgure 5. The wavelengths are monotonically
decreasing with incresing ﬁeld strength except for the transition from the 1(−1) state to the 1(−2) state. As mentioned
above these states cross at γ & 4 000. Therefore the corresponding wavelength for this transition diverges at the
crossing ﬁeld strength. The transition wavelengths for the triplet states shown in ﬁgure 6 are also monotonically
decreasing with increasing ﬁeld strength.

Finally we comment on corrections due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass. There are two kinds of corrections, which are
relevant here. One, which is special for ions in strong magnetic ﬁelds and which describes the coupling between the
center of mass motion and the electronic motion. This coupling is due to a motional electric ﬁeld of intrinsic dynamical
origin seen by the moving ion in a magnetic ﬁeld [31]. Second there are corrections due to the replacement of the
naked masses by reduced ones which can be easily included in our data by performing the corresponding shifts [12–14]
. A full dynamical treatment of the atomic ion including the collective motion goes clearly beyond the scope of the
present investigation. It is important to note that for the case of the ﬁxed negative donors there naturally occur no
such corrections.

V. BRIEF SUMMARY

We have investigated the H− ion, negative donors D− respectively, in a strong magnetic ﬁeld via a fully correlated
approach. The key ingredient is an anisotropic Gaussian basis set, whose one-particle wave functions are nonlinearly
optimized in order to obtain the spectrum of the one-particle Hamiltonian. In contrast to other basis sets, which
are appropriate either for the low ﬁeld or for the high ﬁeld regime, our basis set is ﬂexible enough to be adapted to
the situation of arbitrary ﬁeld strength and especially suited for the intermediate ﬁeld regime. All calculations were
performed in the inﬁnite mass frame neglecting relativistic corrections.

We have investigated the low ﬁeld ground state 10, as well as singlet and triplet states for M = −1, −2, −3 for
the broad ﬁeld regime γ = 8 · 10−4 − 4 · 103. For all states and almost all ﬁeld strengths we could reach at least

1 − 2% higher binding energies, compared to all other published data. For some states our binding energies were
larger by a factor up to two. The global ground state undergoes a crossover with respect to its symmetry which is
well-known in the literature [15]: for weak ﬁelds γ . 5 · 10−2 the global ground state is the 10 state, whereas for
γ & 5 · 10−2 it is the 3(−1) state, which is much weaker bound than the 10 state for all ﬁeld strengths. The 1(−1)
state becomes bound for γ . 5 and it crosses the 1(−3) state at γ ≈ 300 and the 1(−2) state at γ & 4000. We have
also investigated the electronic states with M = −2 in detail. For γ . 1 the triplet state is stronger bound than the
singlet, whereas for γ & 1 the singlet is stronger bound than the triplet. Explanations for the binding mechanisms
of the considered states have been provided. The transition wavelengths for all allowed transitions as a function of
the ﬁeld strength are thereby obtained. No stationary transitions which could be of relevance to the astrophysical
observation in magnetized white dwarfs have been observed.

FIG. 1. Electron detachment energies of the singlet states in atomic units. Note that the M = −1 singlet state is not bound
for weak ﬁelds and is for 5 . γ . 300 weaker bound than all other states considered. For γ ≈ 300 and γ & 4000 we encounter
crossings of the detachment energies of the 1(−1) with those of the 1(−3) and 1(−2) states, respectively.

FIG. 2. Electron detachment energies of the triplet states in atomic units.

FIG. 3. Electron detachment energies of the singlet and triplet state of the M = −2 states in atomic units. Note that the
singlet and triplet state reverse their order: For low ﬁeld strengths the triplet state is more bound whereas for high ﬁelds
(γ & 1) the singlet state is more bound than the triplet state.

FIG. 4. Singlet triplet splitting for the M = −2 and the M = −3 states in atomic units. The splitting due to the spin
Zeeman term is omitted. Note that the splitting of the M = −2 states increases for low ﬁelds but decreases for high ﬁelds,
whereas the splitting for the M = −3 states increases monotonically with increasing ﬁeld strength.

FIG. 5. Singlet transition wavelengths between the considered bound states in ˚Angstrøm as a function of the ﬁeld strengths

in atomic units on a logarithmic scale.

FIG. 6. Triplet transition wavelengths between the considered states in ˚Angstrøm as a function of the ﬁeld strength in atomic

units on a logarithmic scale.

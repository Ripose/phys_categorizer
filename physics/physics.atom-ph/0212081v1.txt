Abstract

We compare the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in two coupled

potential wells with atoms diﬀracting from a standing light wave. The cor-

responding Hamiltonians have an identical appearance, but with a diﬀerent

set of commutation rules. Well-known diﬀraction phenomena as Pendell˝osung

oscillations between opposite momenta in the case of Bragg diﬀraction, and

adiabatic transitions between momentum states are shown to have analogies

in the two-well case. They represent the collective exchange of a ﬁxed number

of atoms between the wells.

I. INTRODUCTION

The most common approach to the description of a trapped Bose-condensed gas is based

on the mean-ﬁeld approximation, which yields the Gross-Pitaevski equation for the macro-

scopic wave function. This wave function, which depends on the number of atoms, plays the

role of the mode function for the Maxwell ﬁeld. This approach is reliable when the conden-

sate is trapped in a single quantum state in a potential well. However, when the condensate

is separated into two or more parts, so that more than one quantum state is populated, the

mean-ﬁeld approach is not evidently justiﬁed. It has been shown by Javanainen and Yoo [1]

that two originally separate parts of a condensate that are initially in a Fock state and that

are brought to overlap will reveal an interference pattern that varies in position from one

realization to another. This eﬀect, which has also been observed experimentally [2] cannot

be described by a single macroscopic wavefunction. A simple model for a condensate in a

double potential well is deﬁned by a ﬁeld-theoretical Hamiltonian for a boson-Hubbard dimer

[3,4], which can be expressed in terms of SU(2) angular momentum-type operators with a

quadratic term. This latter term represents the interaction between atoms in a well. The

mean-ﬁeld approximation is basically equivalent to classical equations of motion for the ex-

pectation values of the SU(2) operators [5,6]. The quantum regime has mainly been studied

numerically, leading to collapse and revival [5], and to non-classical dynamics arising from

the periodic modulation of the coupling between the wells [7]. The formation of a two-well

condensate by the raising of the barrier has been analyzed theoretically [8]. The situation of

a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a two-well trap is also studied experimentally [9,10].

A very similar Hamiltonian describes the situation of an atom diﬀracting from a standing-

wave optical potential. This problem has received attention already in the early days of laser

cooling [11]. More recent work has developed the band structure of the energy spectrum

[12], and a number of regimes have been distinguished that allow an analytical description

[13]. In a simple version of the model, the Hamiltonian is identical in form as in the two-well

problem mentioned above. Now the quadratic term represent the kinetic energy of the atom.

2

The only diﬀerence between the two cases is that the commutation rules for the operators

in the diﬀraction case are slightly simpliﬁed compared to the case of SU(2) symmetry.

In this paper we discuss the analogy and the diﬀerences between these two systems. We

point that a number of analytical solutions known for the diﬀraction problem can be carried

over to the two-well system. The physics of these cases is discussed.

II. BEC IN A DOUBLE POTENTIAL WELL

We consider a potential consisting of two wells. When the barrier between the wells is

not too low, the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state

of a single atom are

When the quadratic term in eq. (9) would be replaced by a linear term, the evolution

would be a uniform rotation in the 2J + 1-dimensional state space with angular frequency

√δ2 + κ2. The presence of the quadratic term makes the dynamics considerably more com-

plex. Therefore we compare this dynamics with another well-known case in which a similar

quadratic term appears.

III. STANDING-WAVE DIFFRACTION OF ATOMS

ω the diﬀerence of the resonance frequency and the optical frequency, and

Hamiltonian takes a particularly simple form in momentum representation, since the kinetic-

energy term is diagonal in momentum, and the potential energy changes the momentum

by

2¯hk. Therefore, we introduce momentum eigenstates

which have the momentum

the algebraic form

where κ = 2¯hk2/m determines the kinetic energy term, and δ = ω2

They diﬀer from the corresponding relations (10) in that now the strength of the hopping

operators is uniform.

This Hamiltonian (12) has the same form as eq. (9), even though they describe com-

pletely diﬀerent physical situations. The diﬀerence is mathematically characterized by the

commutation relations. The SU(2) relations (7) are replaced by the simpler set

to commute. A result of this diﬀerence is that the state space in the two-well case has a

ﬁnite dimension 2J + 1 = N + 1, whereas the momentum space has an inﬁnite number of

dimensions.

A mathematically identical set of operators occurs in the description of the dynamics of

the Wannier-Stark system, consisting of a particle in a periodic potential with an additional

uniform force [14].

In that case, the eigenstates of

We recall three approximate solutions of the evolution governed by the Hamiltonian (12),

which are valid in diﬀerent situations, and which allow analytical solutions.

The Raman-Nath regime is valid for interaction times that are so short that the atom

has no time to propagate. Then the quadratic term in (12) can be neglected, and the

evolution is determined by the atom-ﬁeld coupling δ(t). The evolution operator is simply

U = exp[iφ(
b
the evolution period. The matrix elements of the resulting evolution operator for the pulse

dtδ(t) is the integral of the coupling constant over

B−)/2], where φ =

can be found by operator algebra in the form [14]

in terms of Bessel functions. For an initial state

with a well-determined momentum, the

This leads to explicit analytical expressions for diﬀraction experiments [11]. The probability

The Bragg regime is valid when the coupling δ between neighboring momentum states

is small compared to the kinetic-energy separation

from its

apart from an overall phase factor. This can only occur when the momentum transfer 2µ

(in units of 2¯hk) is an integer, which corresponds precisely to the Bragg condition. The

Pendell¨osung frequency is given by Ωµ = δ(δ/2κ)2µ−1/ [(2µ

1)!]2 [13]. This expression is

−

fully analogous to the eﬀective Rabi frequency for a resonant multiphoton transition, with

non-resonant intermediate states [15,16].

The regime of adiabatic coupling arises for a time-dependent atom-ﬁeld coupling δ(t)

that varies suﬃciently slowly, so that an initial energy eigenstate remains an eigenstate.

The adiabaticity condition in the present case reads

dδ
dt ≪

κδ

(18)

(19)

When an atom passes a standing wave with a suﬃciently smooth variation of the intensity,

and the Bragg condition is fulﬁlled, the presence of two initially degenerate eigenstates

i
leads to interference after the passage, which produces two outgoing beams. Because of the

| ±

µ

similarity between the two Hamiltonians (9) and (12), these well-known diﬀraction cases can

be expected to have analogies in the dynamics of the two-well problem.

In the diﬀraction

case, the states

µ

|

i

neighboring momentum states is independent of µ (eq. (13)), whereas in the two-well case the

µ-dependence of the hopping operator indicated in eq. (10) reﬂects the bosonic accumulation

eﬀect. A consequence of this is also that the Hamiltonian in the diﬀraction case couples an

inﬁnite number of states

, whereas in the two-well case the number of coupled states has

µ
|

i

the ﬁnite value N + 1. In the diﬀraction case we restrict ourselves to the situation that the

Bragg condition is respected. Therefore, both in the diﬀraction case and in the two-well case

µ attains either integer or half-integer values. The action of

Lz is the same in both cases.

The Hamiltonian (19) is invariant for inversion of µ.

symmetry property of H depends on the fact that it is quadratic in the operator

The action of the quadratic term in the Hamiltonian (19) on the new basis is simply

In both cases, the diﬀerence between the Hamiltonian parts on the even and odd sub-

spaces are proportional to δ. These diﬀerences are responsible for the energy splitting

between the even and the odd energy eigenstates. Moreover, since these diﬀerences in the

Hamiltonian parts occur for low values of µ, we expect that the even-odd energy splittings

get small for large µ-values. This is conﬁrmed by numerical calculations. In Figs. 1 and

2 we display the energy levels of the Hamiltonian, for a few values of δ/κ, both for the

double-well case (with N = 100), and for the diﬀraction case. The energy levels are found

to be alternatingly even and odd, with increasing energy. In the two-well case, the energy

shifts and splittings due to the coupling are larger for the same value of δ/κ and the same

value of µ. This arises from the factor Fµ, which is unity in the diﬀraction case, whereas

in the two-well case it decreases from

J = N/2 at µ = 0 to zero at µ = J. In fact, the

∼

condition for weak coupling is that matrix elements coupling the states

V. PENDELL ˝OSUNG OSCILLATIONS

The energy splittings between the even and the odd eigenstates give rise to time-

dependent states that oscillate between the states

µ

. In the diﬀraction case, they corre-
i

|±

spond to the well-known Pendell˝osung oscillations in the Bragg regime. Here we show that

similar oscillations can occur for the two-well problem, and we give an analytical estimation

of the oscillation frequencies. For the generic Hamiltonian given by (19), the Bragg condition

is fulﬁlled when the inequality (26) holds.

The energy diﬀerences between the even and odd states to lowest order in λµ can be found

from the eﬀective Hamiltonian for two degenerate states that are coupled via a number of

non-resonant intermediate states. This situation occurs for the states

µ

, with their 2µ

1

|±

i

−

intermediate states. In this case, the intermediate states can be eliminated adiabatically, as

demonstrated in Sec. 18.7 of ref. [15]. The resulting eﬀective Hamiltonian for these two states

µ

has an oﬀ-diagonal element that is the ratio between two products. The numerator

i

|±
contains the product of the successive 2µ matrix elements

¯hδFµ′/2 of the Hamiltonian

−

coupling neighboring states, and the denominator is the product of the 2µ

energy diﬀerences of the degenerate states

with the successive intermediate states. In

|±

the diﬀraction case, this result coincides with the calculation given in ref. [12], which was

obtained by diagonalizing a tridiagonal matrix and keeping only the lowest order in δ/κ.

Generalizing this result to the present case of the two states

, this eﬀective Hamiltonian leads to a time-dependent state that is

|

given by (17), apart from an irrelevant overall phase factor. This shows that the oscillating

solution (17) corresponding to the Bragg regime of diﬀraction can be generalized to the case

of a condensate in a double well. The same expression (17) remains valid, while the oscillation

frequency Ωµ is determined by eqs. (29) and (30). This describes a state of the condensate

atoms in the double well in the weak-coupling limit. In this case, the state oscillates between

no obvious physical realization of such a term. For the Wannier-Stark system, where the

quadratic term in

which gives rise to Bloch oscillations [14,17]. In the case of the BEC in a double well a term

Lz/2 in the Hamiltonian can be realized by imposing an energy diﬀerence ¯hξ between the

single-particle ground states in the two wells. When this term is periodically varying, it can

be used for coherent control of the condensate [19]. The additional term couples the even

and odd subspaces, thereby breaking the symmetry opf the Hamiltonian. On the basis of

When we assume that both δ and ξ are small compared with the splitting due to the

interparticle interaction κ, so that we remain in the Bragg regime, the two states

remain decoupled from the other number states, and we have an eﬀective two-state system.

In practice, the parameter ξ can be easily controlled, so that many eﬀects of two-state

atoms [18] can also realized for these two states. For example, in analogy to the excitation

of ground-state by an adiabatic sweep across the resonance, one could create an eﬀective

transfer from the state

by varying the parameter ξ adiabatically from

transfer of n = 2µ atoms from one well to the other one.

VI. TIME-DEPENDENT COUPLING

When the coupling δ(t) varies with time, the time-dependent eigenstates of the Hamil-

tonian are coupled to each other. The eigenstate that correlates in the limit δ

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have analyzed both the similarity and the diﬀerence between the dy-

namical behavior of atom diﬀraction from a standing wave and a Bose-Einstein condensate

in a double-well potential. In both cases, the Hamiltonian is given by the generic form (19),

the only diﬀerence being in the commutation rules for the operators

Li. with i = x, y, z.

Well-known diﬀraction phenomena as Pendell˝osung oscillations between opposite momenta

in the case of Bragg diﬀraction, and the result of adiabatic transitions between momentum

states have counterparts in the behavior of the atom distribution over the two wells, in the

case that the coupling between the wells is weak compared to the interatomic interaction

or slowly varying with time. A common underlying reason for these eﬀects is the symmetry

of the Hamiltonian for inversion µ

µ, and the energy splitting between even and odd

↔ −

states arising from the coupling term. In these cases, eﬀective coupling occurs between the

states

n1, n2i
|

and

n2, n1i
|

with opposite imbalance between the particle numbers in the two

wells. These states are coupled without population of the intermediate states, so that a

number of n1 −
interaction is essential for this eﬀect to occur. A simple analytical expression is obtained

atoms in each well can be transferred to a linear superposition of

n1, n2i
|

and

n2, n1i

|

, which

is a highly entangled state of the two wells. A similar analogy is obtained to diﬀraction

in the Raman-Nath regime. For the double-well problem this requires that the coupling is

suﬃciently short to ignore dynamical eﬀect of the atomic interaction during the coupling.

The well-known diﬀraction pattern in terms of the Bessel function is replaced by elements

of theWigner rotation matrix for the double well. These eﬀects do not show up in the

mean-ﬁeld approximation, where the Gross-Pitaevski equation holds.

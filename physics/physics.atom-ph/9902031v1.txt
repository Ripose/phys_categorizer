Abstract. Two-photon detachment from the F − negative ion has been investigated
within the lowest order perturbation theory. We show that in accordance with the
adiabatic theory a proper asymptotic behaviour of the 2p bound state wave function
is crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the multiphoton detachment cross
sections. We ﬁnd that the latter are substantially higher than it was previously
believed.

In the recent papers by Gribakin and Kuchiev (1997a, 1997b) an adiabatic analytical
theory of multiphoton detachment from negative ions has been developed, based on the
Keldysh approach (Keldysh 1964). Simple analytical expressions obtained there for the
diﬀerential and total n-photon detachment cross sections allow one to estimate them for
any negative ion. One of the important points of that work is that the electron escape
from the atomic system in a low-frequency laser ﬁeld takes place at large distances,

where ω is the photon frequency, κ is related to the initial bound state energy, E0 =
κ2/2, and n is the number of quanta absorbed (atomic units are used throughout).

Accordingly, the multiphoton detachment rates are determined by the long-range
asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave function, namely by the asymptotic
Ar−1e−κr. This
parameters A and κ of the bound state radial wave function R(r)
result has been obtained using the length form of the interaction with the laser ﬁeld,
which proves to be the most convenient for multiphoton processes.

The analytical adiabatic approach is valid for multiphoton detachment processes,
1. However, the calculations for H− and halogen negative
i.e., strictly speaking, for n
ions indicate (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a, Kuchiev and Ostrovsky 1998) that the
analytical formulae should give reasonable answers even for n = 2. The aim of the
present work is to verify these conclusions by doing direct numerical calculations of

the photodetachment cross sections to the asymptotic behaviour of the ground state
wavefunction and show that it is indeed very strong. Thus, a “small” 20% error in κ
present in the Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function of the ﬂuorine negative ion results in a
factor of three underestimation of the 2-photon cross section. This emphasizes the need
to use bound-state wavefunctions with correct asymptotic behaviour in calculations of
multiphoton processes.

In this paper we calculate the 2-photon detachment amplitudes, cross sections
and photoelectron angular distribution using the lowest-order perturbation theory and
compare the results obtained with diﬀerent ground state wavefunctions. We present and
analyze the results for the F− negative ion, where the results of a few other theoretical
calculations (Robinson and Geltman 1967, Crance 1987a,b, Pan et al 1990, Pan and
Starace 1991, van der Hart 1996) as well as experimental data (Kwon et al 1989,
Blondel et al 1992, Blondel and Delsart 1993) are known. Pan et al and Pan and
Starace calculated the two-photon detachment cross section and photoelectron angular
distribution in the HF approximation (similar to that used by Crance) and with the
account of ﬁrst-order electron correlation eﬀects. Their results show that the correlation
corrections are about 15% for the partial and total cross sections and almost negligible
for the angular distribution parameters, when the dipole length form is used.

It is often assumed that the HF radial wavefunction is still a good
starting point for calculations of multiphoton detachment, if the experimental binding
energy is used in lieu of the HF value (Crance 1987a,b, Pan et al 1990). Pan et al
(1990) showed that the two-photon detachment cross sections obtained with the dipole
operator in the velocity form are very sensitive to the 2p-electron energy, while the
length form results change little when the HF energy is replaced by the experimental
one. However, one should use not only use the correct energy but, which is much

†
The importance of large distances, where one can use the correct asymptotic form of
the bound-state wave function, speaks strongly in favour of using the length form of
the dipole operator (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a). To correct the 2p wavefunction we
solved the HF equations for the F− ground state with an additional small repulsive
potential V (r) = α/[2(r2 + a2)2]. We chose α = 1 and a = 0.61 au to ensure that
the 2p energy was equal to the experimental value. The HF and corrected 2p radial
wavefunctions P (r) = R(r)/r are presented in ﬁgure 1(a). The diﬀerence between them
appears to be small – it does not exceed 10% near the maximum. Their asymptotic

respectively. The diﬀerence in κ means that the two wavefunctions are in fact quite

The wavefunctions of the intermediate (νl) and ﬁnal (εf lf ) states of the
photoelectron are calculated in the HF ﬁeld of the frozen neutral 2p5 core. The
photoelectron is coupled to the core to form the total spin S = 0 and angular momentum

state momentum grid with constant spacing ∆p.

There are two ways of calculating the two-photon amplitudes Mlf l of equation (4).
The ﬁrst is by direct summation over the intermediate states. It involves a non-trivial
evaluation of the free-free dipole matrix elements together with the accurate treatment
of pole- and δ-type singularities (Korol 1994, 1997). Another way of calculating such
sums is by solving an inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger-type equation for the eﬀective radial
function of the intermediate state

It is instructive to look at the shape of the eﬀective wavefunction Pω(r). As an
example, ﬁgure 1(b) shows this function calculated for the intermediate d electron at
ω = 0.226 Ryd for the HF ground state. The maximum of Pω(r) is shifted towards large
radii, compared to the maximum of the ground state wavefunction. Also shown in ﬁgure
1(b) are the radial wavefunction of the ﬁnal p-wave electron (εf = 2ω + EHF
2p = 0.09
Ryd) and the integrand Pεf lf (r)Pω(r)r of equation (9). These plots illustrate the point
that the two-photon amplitude Mlf ln (ω) is indeed determined by large electron-atom
separations (1). Accordingly, the correct asymptotic behaviour of the ground state
wavefunction is crucial.

In this work we compare the cross sections and angular asymmetry parameters
calculated in diﬀerent approximations with both the HF and corrected 2p wavefunctions
(ﬁgure 1(a)). Let us ﬁrst discuss the results obtained with the HF energy of the 2p
electron. It corresponds to the two-photon threshold ω = 0.181 Ryd. The cross section
calculated from equations (2)–(4) using the HF functions of the initial, intermediate
and ﬁnal states are shown in ﬁgure 2 by a short-dashed line. It is very similar to the
dipole length lowest-order HF results of Pan et al (1990), although the latter are about
10% lower than ours. What is the source of this discrepancy? Pan et al used the
Roothaan-HF expansion of the bound state. This form of the bound-state wavefunction
has an incorrect asymptotic behaviour at r > 7, see ﬁgure 1(a), inset. Because of the
importance of large electron-atom separations in the multiphoton processes even a small
error in the wave function could lead to some inaccuracies in the 2-photon detachment
amplitudes. In the work of Pan et al electron correlation eﬀects were calculated. It was
shown that they suppress the cross section in F− by about 20% at the maximum. These
results shown in ﬁgure 2 by open squares are still close to the HF curve.

The asymptotic parameters of the HF 2p wave function are κ = 0.6016 and A = 0.94.
We use them in the adiabatic theory formula (equation (5) of Gribakin and Kuchiev
1997b) and obtain the cross section shown in ﬁgure 2 by solid dots. It reproduces the
energy dependence of the HF cross section well, though overestimates its magnitude by
a factor of two. This is a reasonable result, since the adiabatic theory should only be

valid for n
1. The calculations of Gribakin and Kuchiev (1997a) showed that for
H− and n = 3 the analytical adiabatic results are already 20% accurate. There are two
approximations made in the adiabatic theory: (i) the use of the Volkov wavefunction
to describe the photoelectron, and (ii) the saddle-point calculation of the integral over
time, which enables one to express the amplitude in terms of the asymptotic parameters
of the bound state. In the weak-ﬁeld regime the use of the Volkov function is equivalent
to the the so-called ‘free-electron’ approximation (examined earlier by Crance). In this
approximation the wavefunctions of the photoelectron in the intermediate and ﬁnal
states are described by plane waves. When we do such calculation for F− (chain curve
in ﬁgure 2) the results turn out to be very close to those of the adiabatic theory. This
means that the approximation (ii) of the adiabatic theory is in fact quite good even at
n = 2.

When we use the experimental energy of the 2p electron together with the HF
wavefunctions the magnitude of the 2-photon cross section changes very little (dashed
line in ﬁgure 2), as seen earlier by Pan et al (1990) for both HF and correlated results
(open circles). The HF results of Crance (1987a) are close to the above, and the cross
section of van der Hart (1996) is also similar, with a maximum of 1.27 au at ω = 0.166
Ryd.

However, when we use the corrected 2p wavefunction, the photodetachment cross
section increases more than three times.
It is shown by solid line in ﬁgure 2, and
we consider this to be the best evaluation of the cross section for F−. The cusp

demonstrated by the adiabatic theory (with modiﬁed asymptotic parameters κ = 0.4998
and A = 0.86) and the plane-wave results. As we explained earlier, this “surprising”
sensitivity of the multiphoton detachment probabilities to the asymptotic form of the
bound-state wavefunction is a direct consequence of the dominant role of large electron-
atom separations in this problem (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a).

The error induced by the use of an asymptotically incorrect wave function can be
estimated within the adiabatic approach. It turns out that if one uses the experimental

underestimation of the cross section. For F− the factor (10) calculated for ∆κ = 0.1
and ω = 0.085 au near the cross section maximum, yields 0.33. This value agrees with
the diﬀerence between the cross sections observed in ﬁgure 2. The only other work that
used an asymptotically correct 2p wave function was the model potential calculation of
Robinson and Geltman (1967), which produced a cross section two times greater than
those of Crance, Pan et al and van der Hart.

To estimate the size of possible errors introduced by our way of correcting the 2p
wavefunction we have examined the dependence of our cross section on the choice of α
and a in the repulsive potential. We ﬁnd that as long as the asymptotic behaviour of
the 2p state remains correct, the two-photon cross sections are always proportional to
that shown by the solid line in ﬁgure 2. Diﬀerent pairs of α and a result in the variation
of A, and the magnitude of the cross section is simply proportional to A2. Our value of
A = 0.86 is close to A = 0.84 from Radtsig and Smirnov (1986) and we are sure that
our results are basically correct. Even a large 10% uncertainty in the value of A would
mean a maximal 20% error in the cross section. In any case the cross section will be
much larger than those obtained with the HF 2p ground state.

The diﬀerence between experimental and HF values of the 2p energy is a

behaviour of the ground-state wavefunction. This is by far the most important
correlation eﬀect in multiphoton detachment. The use of the asymptotically correct
2p wavefunction changes the cross section by a factor of three, which is much greater
than other correlation eﬀects (Pan et al 1990). This fact distinguishes this problem
from the single-photon processes, where other correlation eﬀects are essential.

The angular asymmetry parameters β2 and β4 calculated using the experimental 2p
energy are shown in ﬁgure 3, together with the correlated length results of Pan and
Starace (1991) and experimental points of Blondel and Delsart (1993) at ω = 0.171
Ryd. The asymmetry parameters (7) are relative quantities, and the results of
diﬀerent calculations are much closer for them than for the absolute values of the
photodetachment cross sections. The adiabatic theory is again in good agreement with
the plane-wave approximation, especially in β4. It appears that this parameter is on the
whole less sensitive to the details of the calculation, because it is simply proportional to
the amplitude of f wave emission, and there is no interference in the sum in equation
(7) for β4. The experimental values of β for F− obtained in the earlier work of Blondel
et al (1992) are close to those of Blondel and Delsart (1993). This is why F− serves as
a good benchmark for angular asymmetry calculations. The perfect agreement between
adiabatic theory and the experiment is probably fortuitous. Figure 3 indicates that for
the experiment to be able to distinguish between various theoretical data one would
wish to make measurements at higher photon energies, where the results of diﬀerent
approximations diverge.

8

From the theoretical point of view it seems that the total cross sections and the
angular asymmetry parameters are determined by diﬀerent physical features of the
problem. The absolute size of the cross sections is very sensitive to the asymptotic
behaviour of the bound state wave function. This sensitivity increases for large-n
processes, when ω become smaller, as suggested by estimate (10). The cross sections
also depend on the atomic potential which acts on the photoelectron, hence the
diﬀerence between the results obtained with the HF and plane waves. This latter
eﬀect is suppressed for larger n, since this re-scattering of the photoelectron is inversely
proportional to some power of large R. The angular asymmetry parameters are aﬀected
by the electron-atom potential via the scattering phaseshifts δlf . However, for large
n and small photoelectron energy E
ω the phaseshifts should be close to integer
multiples of π. Besides that, contributions of higher partial waves become dominant.
They are almost unaﬀected by the atomic potential and the adiabatic theory should
become very accurate.

∼

In summary, we have shown by direct numerical calculations that in agreement
with the adiabatic theory, the multiphoton detachment rates are very sensitive to the
asymptotic behaviour of the bound state wavefunction. For ﬂuorine this means that the
true 2-photon detachment cross sections are substantially higher than it was believed
earlier. The discrepancy revealed is much greater than other electron correlation eﬀects.

(Dated: February 2, 2008)
Over ﬁve years we have compared the hyperﬁne frequencies of 133Cs and 87Rb atoms in their
electronic ground state using several laser cooled 133Cs and 87Rb atomic fountains with an accuracy
of ∼ 10−15. These measurements set a stringent upper bound to a possible fractional time variation

= (0.2 ± 7.0) × 10−16 yr−1 (1σ uncertainty).

The same limit applies to a possible variation of the quantity (µRb/µCs)α−0.44, which involves the

ratio of nuclear magnetic moments and the ﬁne structure constant.

Since Dirac’s 1937 formulation of his large number hy-
pothesis aiming at tying together the fundamental con-
stants of physics [1], large amount of work has been de-
voted to test if these constants were indeed constant over
time [2, 3].

In General Relativity and in all metric theories of grav-
itation, variations with time and space of non gravita-
tional fundamental constants such as the ﬁne structure
constant α = e2/4πǫ0~c are forbidden. They would vi-
olate Einstein’s Equivalence Principle (EEP). EEP im-
poses the Local Position Invariance stating that in a lo-
cal freely falling reference frame, the result of any lo-
cal non gravitational experiment is independent of where
and when it is performed. On the other hand, almost all
modern theories aiming at unifying gravitation with the
three other fundamental interactions predict violation of
EEP at levels which are within reach of near-future ex-
periments [4, 5]. As the internal energies of atoms or
molecules depend on electromagnetic, as well as strong
and weak interactions, comparing the frequency of elec-
tronic transitions, ﬁne structure transitions and hyperﬁne
transitions as a function of time or gravitational potential
provides an interesting test of the validity of EEP.

To date, very stringent tests exist on geological and
cosmological timescales. The analysis of the Oklo nu-
clear reactor showed that, 2 × 109 years ago, α did not
diﬀer from the present value by more than 10−7 of its
value [6]. Light emitted by distant quasars has been
used to perform absorption spectroscopy of interstellar
clouds. For instance, measurements of the wavelengths of
molecular hydrogen transitions test a possible variation
of the electron to proton mass ratio me/mp [7]. Compar-
isons between the gross structure and the ﬁne structure
of neutral atoms and ions would indicate that α for a
redshift z ∼ 1.5 (∼ 10 Gyr) diﬀered from the present
value: ∆α/α = (−7.2 ± 1.8) × 10−6 [8]. Today this is the
only claim that fundamental constants might change.

On much shorter timescales, several tests using fre-
quency standards have been performed [9, 10, 11]. These
laboratory tests have a very high sensitivity to changes in
fundamental constants. They are repeatable, systematic
errors can be tracked as experimental conditions can be
changed.

In this letter we present results that place a new strin-
gent limit to the time variation of fundamental constants.
By comparing the hyperﬁne energies of 133Cs and 87Rb in
their electronic ground state over a period of nearly ﬁve
years, we place an upper limit to the rate of change of
the ratio of the hyperﬁne frequencies νRb/νCs. Our mea-
surements take advantage of the high accuracy (∼ 10−15)
of several laser cooled Cs and Rb atomic fountains. Ac-
cording to recent atomic structure calculations [11, 12],
these measurements are sensitive to a possible variation
of the quantity (µRb/µCs)α−0.44, where µ’s are the nu-
clear magnetic moments. We anticipate major advances
in these tests using frequency standards, thanks to recent
advances in optical frequency metrology using femtosec-
ond lasers [13, 14].

In our experiments, three atomic fountains are com-
pared to each other, using a hydrogen maser (H-maser)
as a ﬂywheel oscillator (Fig.1). Two fountains, a trans-
portable fountain FOM, and FO1 [15] are using cesium
atoms. The third fountain is a dual fountain (DF) [16],
operating alternately with rubidium (DFRb) and cesium
(DFCs). These fountains have been continuously up-
graded in order to improve their accuracy from 2 × 10−15
in 1998 to 8 × 10−16 for cesium and from 1.3 × 10−14 [17]
to 6 × 10−16 for rubidium.

Fountain clocks operate as follows. First, atoms are
collected and laser cooled in an optical molasses or in a
magneto-optical trap in 0.3 to 0.6 s. Atoms are launched
upwards, and selected in the clock level (mF = 0) by a
combination of microwave and laser pulses. Then, atoms
interact twice with a microwave ﬁeld tuned near the

2

hyperﬁne frequency, in a Ramsey interrogation scheme.
The microwave ﬁeld is synthesized from a low phase noise
100 MHz signal from a quartz oscillator, which is phase
locked to the reference signal of the H-maser (Fig.1). Af-
ter the microwave interactions, the population of each
hyperﬁne state is measured using light induced ﬂuores-
cence. This provides a measurement of the transition
probability as a function of microwave detuning. Suc-
cessive measurements are used to steer the average mi-
crowave ﬁeld to the frequency of the atomic resonance
using a digital servo system. The output of the servo
provides a direct measurement of the frequency diﬀer-
ence between the H-maser and the fountain clock.

FIG. 1: BNM-SYRTE clock ensemble. A single 100 MHz sig-
nal from a H-maser is used for frequency comparisons and is
distributed to each of the microwave synthesizers of the 133Cs
(FO1, FOM, DFCs) and 87Rb fountain clocks. In 2001, the
Rb fountain has been upgraded and is now a dual fountain
using alternately rubidium (DFRb) or cesium atoms (DFCs).

The three fountains have diﬀerent geometries and op-
erating conditions: the number of detected atoms ranges
from 3 × 105 to 2 × 106 at a temperature of ∼ 1 µK, the
fountain cycle duration from 1.1 to 1.6 s. The Ramsey
resonance width is between 0.9 and 1.2 Hz. In measure-
ments reported here the fractional frequency instability
is (1 − 2) × 10−13τ −1/2, where τ is the averaging time in
seconds. Fountain comparisons have a typical resolution
of ∼ 10−15 for a 12 hour integration, and each of the four
data campaigns lasts from 1 to 2 months during which
an accuracy evaluation of each fountain is performed.

The 2002 measurements are presented in Fig.2, which
displays the maser fractional frequency oﬀset, measured
by the Cs fountains FOM and DFCs. Also shown is the
H-maser frequency oﬀset measured by the Rb fountain
DFRb where the Rb hyperﬁne frequency is convention-
ally chosen to be νRb(1999) = 6 834 682 610.904 333 Hz,
our 1999 value. The data are corrected for the systematic
frequency shifts listed in Table I. The H-maser frequency
exhibits fractional ﬂuctuations on the order of 10−14 over
a few days, ten times larger than the typical statistical
uncertainty resulting from the instability of the fountain

quency shifts using several methods [19, 20]. All other
eﬀects do not contribute signiﬁcantly and their uncer-
tainties are added quadratically. We searched for the
inﬂuence of synchronous perturbations by changing the
timing sequence and the atom launch height. To search
for possible microwave leakage, we changed the power
(×9) in the interrogation microwave cavity. No shift was
found at a resolution of 10−15. The shift due to residual
coherences and populations in neighboring Zeeman states
is estimated to be less than 10−16. As shown in [21], the
shift due to the microwave photon recoil is very similar
for Cs and Rb and smaller than +1.4 × 10−16. Relativis-
tic corrections (gravitational redshift and second order
Doppler eﬀect) contribute to less than 10−16 in the clock
comparisons.

For the Cs-Cs 2002 comparison, we ﬁnd:

where the ﬁrst parenthesis reﬂects the 1σ statistical un-
certainty, and the second the systematic uncertainty, ob-
tained by adding quadratically the inaccuracies of the
two Cs clocks (see Table I). The two Cs fountains are in
good agreement despite their signiﬁcantly diﬀerent oper-
ating conditions (see Table I), showing that systematic
eﬀects are well understood at the 10−15 level.

In 2002, the 87Rb frequency measured with respect to

the average 133Cs frequency is found to be:

νRb(2002) = 6 834 682 610.904 324(4)(7) Hz

(2)

where the error bars now include DFRb, DFCs and FOM
uncertainties. This is the most accurate frequency mea-
surement to date.

In Fig.3 are plotted all our Rb-Cs frequency compar-
isons. Except for the less precise 1998 data [17], two Cs
fountains were used together to perform the Rb measure-
ments. The uncertainties for the 1999 and 2000 measure-
ments were 2.7 × 10−15, because of lower clock accuracy
and lack of rigorous simultaneity in the earlier frequency
comparisons [16]. A weighted linear ﬁt to the data in
Fig.3 determines how our measurements constrain a pos-
sible time variation of νRb/νCs. We ﬁnd:

which represents a 5-fold improvement over our previous
results [16] and a 100-fold improvement over the Hg+-H
hyperﬁne energy comparison [11].

We now examine how this result constrains possible
variations of fundamental constants. For an alkali with
atom number Z, the hyperﬁne transition frequency can
be approximated by:

where R∞ is the Rydberg constant, c the speed of light,
µ the magnetic moment of the nucleus, µN the nu-
clear magneton. Frel(Zα) is a relativistic function which
strongly increases with Z [11, 22]. For 133Cs, this Casimir
relativistic contribution amounts to 40 % of the hyper-
ﬁne splitting and α ∂ln(Frel(Zα))
= 0.74. For 87Rb, this
quantity is 0.30 [27]. Following [11] and neglecting possi-
ble changes of the strong and weak interactions aﬀecting
µRb and µCs, the sensitivity of the ratio νRb/νCs to a
variation of α is simply given by:

Using equations 3 and 5, we thus set the new limit:
˙α/α = (−0.4 ± 16) × 10−16 yr−1.

In contrast with [11], Ref.[22] argues that a time varia-
tion of the nuclear magnetic moments must also be con-
sidered in a comparison between hyperﬁne frequencies.
The magnetic moments µ can be calculated using the
Schmidt model. For atoms with odd A and Z such as
87Rb and 133Cs, the Schmidt magnetic moment µ(s) is
found to depend only on gp, the proton gyromagnetic
ratio. With this simple model, Ref.[22] ﬁnds:

Attributing any variation of νRb/νCs to a variation of
˙gp/gp = (0.1 ± 3.5) ×
gp, equations 3 and 6 lead to:
10−16 yr−1. However, it must be noted that the Schimdt
model is over simpliﬁed and does not agree very accu-
rately with the actual magnetic moment.

Moreover, attributing all the time variation of νRb/νCs
to either gp or α independently is somewhat artiﬁcial.
Theoretical models allowing for a variation of α also al-
low for variations in the strength of the strong and elec-
troweak interactions. For instance, Ref.[5] argues that
Grand uniﬁcation of the three interactions implies that
a time variation of α necessarily comes with a time vari-
ation of the coupling constants of the other interactions.
Ref.[5] predicts that a fractional variation of α is ac-
companied with a ∼ 40 times larger fractional change
of me/mp. In order to independently test the stability of
the three fundamental interactions, several comparisons
between diﬀerent atomic species and/or transitions are
required. For instance and as illustrated in [14], absolute
frequency measurements of an optical transition is sensi-
tive to a diﬀerent combination of fundamental constants:
(µCs/µN )(me/mp)αx, where x depends on the particular
atom and/or transition.

A more complete theoretical analysis going beyond the
Schmidt model would clearly be very useful to interpret
frequency comparisons involving hyperﬁne transitions.
This is especially important as most precise frequency
measurements, both in the microwave and the optical
domain [14, 23, 24], are currently referenced to the 133Cs
hyperﬁne splitting, the basis of the SI deﬁnition of the
second. The H hyperﬁne splitting, which is calculable to
a high accuracy, has already been considered as a possi-
ble reference several decades ago. Unfortunately, despite
numerous eﬀorts, the H hyperﬁne splitting is currently
measured to only 7 parts in 1013 (using H-masers), al-
most three orders of magnitude worse than the results
presented in this letter.

In summary, by comparing 133Cs and 87Rb hyperﬁne
energies, we have set a stringent upper limit to a possi-
ble fractional variation of the quantity (µRb/µCs)α−0.44
at (−0.2 ± 7.0) × 10−16yr−1. In the near future, accura-
cies near 1 part in 1016 should be achievable in microwave
atomic fountains, improving our present Rb-Cs compar-
ison by one order of magnitude.

We anticipate that comparisons between rapidly pro-
gressing optical and microwave laser-cooled frequency
standards currently developed in several laboratories will
bring orders of magnitude gain in sensitivity. In order to
have the full beneﬁt of these advances, frequency com-
parisons with improved accuracy between these distant
clocks will be necessary. Serving this purpose, a new
generation of time/frequency transfer at the 10−16 level
is currently under development for the ESA space mission
ACES which will ﬂy ultra-stable clocks on board the in-
ternational space station in 2006 [25]. These comparisons
will also allow for a search of a possible change of fun-
damental constants induced by the annual modulation of
the Sun gravitational potential due to the elliptical orbit
of the Earth [26].

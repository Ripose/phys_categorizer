An exact quantization rule for the bound states of the one-

dimensional Schr¨odinger equation is presented and is generalized to the

three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with a spherically symmetric po-

tential.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the development of quantum mechanics, the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules

of the old quantum theory [1] occupy a position intermediate between classical and

quantum mechanics. The WKB approximation [2–4] is a method for the approximate

treatment of the Schr¨odinger wave function with another quantization rule [1]:

where xA and xB are two turning points

E = V (xA) = V (xB),

EV (x),

xA < x < xB,

(2)

and n is the number of nodes of the WKB wave function between two turning points.

The half-integer number is the quantum correction to the Bohr-Sommerfeld result,

which comes from the fact that the wave function in WKB analysis may extend into

the classically forbidden region. The WKB method is precise for the harmonic oscil-

lator potential, and is expected to be most useful in the nearly classical limit of large

quantum numbers, namely, it is good when n is large in comparison with unity. Various

reﬁnements have been developed to improve the accuracy of the WKB method [5–7]

where the main modiﬁcation was made on the phase loss at the turning points. Re-

cently, Cao et al. presented a calculation method, called the analytic transfer matrix

method (ATMM) [8,9], for the energy levels of bound states of the one-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation, where the phase contribution picked up by the scattered sub-

waves was included in the new quantization rule. The accurate numerical calculation

results for some examples were given there [8,9]. This is a prospective method for

calculating the energy levels of bound states of the Schr¨odinger equation, but has to be

developed and improved further. In this Letter we apply the matching condition of the

logarithmic derivatives (which is a standard method in quantum mechanics) and the

fundamental concept of the mathematical analysis to the problem of bound states of

one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation, and derive an exact quantization rule without

any approximation. The quantization rule is rigorous and general for any Schr¨odinger

equation with only one variable. It is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics.

The plan of this Letter is as follows. In section 2 we will develop the method of

the numerical calculation for the energy levels of bound states of the one-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation by the matching condition of the logarithm derivatives of the

wave function. In section 3 we present an exact quantization rule for one-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation. The quantization rule is proved without any approximation. Its

validity can also be conﬁrmed with some solvable examples. In section 4 the quantiza-

tion rule is generalized to the three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with a spherically

symmetric potential. The conclusion is given in section 5.

positive, ﬁnite and non-vanishing (see Appendix A). The calculated precision depends

on the number n of the ﬁlms. In principle, one may obtain a precise φ(xA) if n is large

Cao et al. [8] derived the recursive relations similar to Eqs. (14), (15) and (19),

and calculated some examples with more precise results than those obtained with the

nonintegral Maslov index and the standard WKB method. Zhou et al. [9] calculated a

problem with a one-dimensional symmetric double-well potential. Since the potential

is symmetric, V (

x) = V (x), the solution ψ(x) of the Schr¨odinger equation is even

−

or odd in the spatial inversion, and then, its logarithm derivative φ(x) is odd. If a

nontrivial solution ψ(x) is odd, ψ(0) = 0 and φ(x) has to be inﬁnity, φ(0+) = +

.

If a nontrivial solution ψ(x) is even, ψ(0)

∞
= 0 and φ(x) has to be zero because φ(x)

is odd, namely, φ(0+) = 0. One can calculate the energy levels of this system by the

above method in the half space 0 < x <

The quantization rule (26) is proved without any approximation, so that it is exact.

Its validity can also be conﬁrmed by comparing it with the following solvable exam-

ples. Both Eqs. (23) and (24) are the formulas of numerical calculation for Eq. (26).

Cao et al. [8,9] presented an expression similar to Eq. (24) and demonstrated it to

be very eﬀective in numerical calculation through two examples: the one-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation with a power-law potential [8] and a symmetric double-well po-

tential [9].

IV. THREE-DIMENSIONAL SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

Consider the three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with a spherically symmetric

potential. After separation of the angular part of the wave function,

ψ(r) = r−

the radial equation of the Schr¨odinger equation is

Since Eq. (39) is similar to Eq. (3), its energy levels can be calculated by the matching

conditions of the logarithm derivatives, where the logarithm derivative is deﬁned as

φ(r) = R(r)−

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this Letter, with the matching condition of the logarithm derivatives and the

fundamental concept of the mathematical analysis, we proposed a formula (23) for nu-

merically calculating the energy levels of bound states of the Schr¨odinger equation in

one dimension. Calculating the integral form of Eq. (23), we obtained an exact quan-

tization rule (26) for the bound states of the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation.

The exact quantization rule was generalized to bound states of the three-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation with a spherically symmetric potential. The quantization rule was

conﬁrmed by checking some examples where the solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation

are known. Two examples of numerical calculation for the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger

equation with a power-law potential [8] and with a symmetric double-well potential [9]

demonstrated that the exact quantization rule is very eﬀective in numerical calculation.

Cao et al. [8,9] derived a formula similar to Eq. (24). However, their formulation

contained some unclear points. The integer N in Eq. (29) of Ref. [8] is unclariﬁed.

They introduced the “exponentially decaying coeﬃcients” Pj, but the physical meaning

of Pj is rather ambiguous. In fact, Pj are nothing but the logarithm derivatives of the

wave function (in their region of 0
region of xD ≤
the turning points, which was not explained clearly in Ref. [8]. Finally we would like

Appendix A Property of φ(xA)

From the recursive relation (14) and φ(xI)0, we have proved that φ(xA) is non-

negative and ﬁnite. Now, we are going to prove that φ(xA)

= 0 by reduction to

absurdity. When x

φ(xA) = 0, from Eq. (6) we have φ(xA)

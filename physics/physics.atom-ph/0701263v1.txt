We have demonstrated Zeeman slowing and capture of neutral 225Ra and 226Ra atoms in a
magneto-optical trap (MOT). The intercombination transition 1S0→3P1 is the only quasi-cycling
transition in radium and was used for laser-cooling and trapping. Repumping along the 3D1→1P1
transition extended the lifetime of the trap from milliseconds to seconds. Room-temperature black-
body radiation was demonstrated to provide repumping from the metastable 3P0 level. We measured
the isotope shift and hyperﬁne splittings on the 3D1→1P1 transition with the laser-cooled atoms,
and set a limit on the lifetime of the 3D1 level based on the measured blackbody repumping rate.
Laser-cooled and trapped radium is an attractive system for studying fundamental symmetries.

Radium is an alkaline-earth element with no stable
isotopes, and as a result has eluded detailed spectro-
scopic studies. Recent calculations have suggested that
radium, due to its nuclear and atomic properties, is an
excellent candidate for next generation fundamental sym-
metry tests. The observation of a permanent electric
dipole moment (EDM) in an atom, molecule, or the neu-
tron would signal the long sought-after violation of time-
reversal symmetry (T -violation, or CP -violation through
the CP T theorem) in a composite particle. Currently,
the most stringent limits on T -violating interactions in
the nucleus are set by experiments that determined the
atomic EDM of 199Hg to be < 2.1 × 10−28 e cm [1]. Both
collective [2, 3, 4] and mean-ﬁeld [5, 6, 7] calculations
have predicted that radium isotopes which are charac-
terized by nuclear octupole deformation are two to three
orders of magnitude more sensitive to T -violating inter-
actions in the nucleus than 199Hg [8, 9]. 225Ra is a par-
ticularly promising candidate for an EDM search because
it has a relatively long half-life (t1/2 = 14.9 days) and it
has nuclear spin I = 1/2 (like 199Hg), which eliminates
potential systematic electric quadrupole shifts in EDM
measurements. In addition to the atomic EDM, atomic
parity violation eﬀects are also enhanced by a few or-
ders of magnitude in radium due to the near degener-
acy between the parity-odd 3P1 level and the parity-even
3D2 level [10, 11], which are believed to be only 5 cm−1
apart [12]. Conventional atomic-beam or vapor-cell ap-
proaches to these EDM or parity-violation measurements
are precluded because of the scarcity and low vapor pres-
sure of radium, respectively. Instead, a measurement on
atoms laser-cooled and conﬁned in a far-oﬀ resonant op-
tical dipole trap or optical lattice provides a promising
path [13, 14].

In this Letter, we report on the ﬁrst realization of laser-
cooling and trapping of 225Ra and 226Ra (t1/2=1600 yr,

culated decay rates [15, 16] are shown (3P1 lifetime comes

I=0). This is the heaviest and only the second element
with no stable isotopes (after francium [18, 19]) laser-
trapped to date. Radium is unique among alkaline-earth
elements in that the weak, intercombination transition
1S0→3P1 is the only quasi-cycling transition suitable for
laser-cooling and trapping.

The energy level structure [12] and decay rates [15, 16]
for the radium atom are shown in Fig. 1. While the
strong, singlet to singlet transition 1S0→1P1 is exploited
for eﬃcient Zeeman slowing and ﬁrst-stage cooling in
Mg, Ca, Sr, and Yb, the higher-Z Ra atom is limited to

tion 7s2 1S0→ 7s7p 3P1 transition is calculated to af-
ford ≈ 2.4 × 104 cycles before leaking to the 7s6d 3D1
level
[15, 17]. By then repumping the atom to the
7s7p 1P1 level, which quickly decays back to the ground
7s2 1S0 level, we extend the number of laser-cooling tran-
sitions in the MOT to ≈ 3×107 and the laser-cooling time
from tens of milliseconds to tens of seconds. As indicated
by the spectrum inset in Fig. 1, room temperature black-
body radiation can also redistribute population between
the 3P1, 3D2, 3D1, and 3P0 levels.

226Ra is a long-lived isotope and 225Ra is an α-
daughter of long-lived 229Th (t1/2 = 7340 yr), so it is
not necessary to conduct this experiment at an acceler-
ator [20]. Typically, ≈0.7 µCi of 226Ra (≈0.7 µg) and
≈1 mCi of 225Ra (≈25 nano-g) are used. The radium is
dissolved in 0.1 M nitric acid, pipetted onto an Al foil
and placed in an oven with ≈50 mg of Ba metal. The Ba
serves the dual purpose of reducing the Ra(NO3)2 and
passivating the oven surfaces. We typically run the oven
at 600◦C - 750◦C and maintain a vacuum in the trap
region of ≈ 10−8 Torr.

For laser-cooling along the 1S0→3P1 transition (λ =
714 nm, Γ = 2π × 380 kHz, Isat = 140 µW/cm2), we
excite along (J = 0)→(J ′ = 1) for 226Ra and (F =
1/2)→(F ′ = 3/2) for 225Ra. We use a Ti:Sapphire ring
laser which is referenced to molecular iodine lines. The
repump 3D1→1P1 transition is excited with an external
cavity diode laser at 1429 nm. The laser is locked to a
Fabry-Perot cavity, which is stabilized by a He-Ne laser.
For spectroscopy on the repump transition, the scanning
repump laser is monitored with a wavemeter and hetero-
dyned with a second 1429 nm external cavity diode laser
which is locked to the Fabry-Perot.

The atoms emitted from the oven are ﬁrst laser-cooled
transversely in two dimensions and then slowed in a 0.9 m
Zeeman slower, which can capture atoms with velocities
up to 60 m/s (10−3 of the longitudinal velocity proﬁle
for T ≈ 700◦C). Because our slow cycling transition and
3 cm laser beams yield a relatively low MOT capture
velocity of 10 m/s, we used an integrated geometry in
which the slower magnetic ﬁelds merge smoothly with
the 1 G/cm MOT magnetic ﬁeld. The transverse-cooling,
slowing, and MOT beams are typically detuned from the
atomic transition by -3×, -12×, and -6×Γ with intensities
of 50×, 30×, and 20×Isat, respectively.

After slowing and collecting atoms in the trap for
≈0.5 s, the transverse-cooling and slowing beams are
shuttered and the MOT light is frequency-shifted (typ-
ically to -3×Γ) and attenuated (to 2×Isat total in all

atoms in the atomic beam (multiplied by 100×, open circles)
and laser-cooled in the MOT (ﬁlled circles). b) The number
of atoms detected in the MOT over the 1.8 s following the
shuttering (unshuttering) of the slower beam at t = 0 yields

identical lifetime τ = 1.1 s for these data.

beams). By chopping the MOT light at 1 MHz (50%
duty cycle) and counting the ﬂuorescence photons while
the light is oﬀ, we take advantage of the long lifetime of
the 3P1 to eliminate scattered laser light and gain sen-
sitivity to single trapped radium atoms. We can also
detect the 483 nm photon from the 1P1→1S0 decay to
monitor the repump rate.

In Fig. 2a, we show the ﬂuorescence from 226Ra atoms
in the trap chamber as a function of MOT light fre-
quency for both the untrapped atomic beam (multiplied
by 100×) and the laser-cooled atoms captured in the
MOT. During this probe phase, the laser is still cooling as
evidenced by the asymmetric line shape and the red-shift
of the MOT signal with respect to the atomic beam sig-
nal. Figure 2b shows exponential ﬁts to the loading and
decay curves for the radium MOT, which yield a lifetime
τ = 1.1 s that is consistent with the time scale for colli-
sions with the background gas. The loading eﬃciency of
the MOT can be deﬁned as ǫ = L/F = N/(F τ ), where
L is the loading rate, F is the atomic ﬂux from the oven,
and N is the number of atoms observed in the trap. The
atomic ﬂux F of 225Ra is obtained by exposing a deposi-
tion target to the atomic beam and subsequently count-
ing in situ the number of 40 keV gamma-rays emitted
during the radioactive decay of the 225Ra nuclei using a
germanium detector; the 226Ra ﬂux is estimated by scal-
ing from the 225Ra ﬂux by the quantities introduced into
the oven. Typically, we observe ﬂuxes of 3 × 107 s−1 and
109 s−1 and atom trap numbers of 20 and 700 for 225Ra
and 226Ra, respectively, yielding approximate eﬃciencies
of ǫ ≈ 7 × 10−7 for both isotopes.

Absolute frequencies of the laser-cooling 1S0→3P1
transitions can be extracted based on the known iodine
line positions [21, 22]. The energies for 225Ra and 226Ra
are 13999.269(1) cm−1 [17] and 13999.357(1) cm−1, re-
spectively. The value for 226Ra diﬀers by 700 MHz from

Moore’s value [12] of 13999.38 cm−1 which is based on
the 1934 measurements by Rasmussen [23].

As shown in the inset of Fig. 1, thermal blackbody ra-
diation at 300 K, for which the photon number distribu-
tion is peaked at 210 cm−1, should be expected to play an
important role in redistributing population between the
3P1, 3D2, 3D1, and 3P0 levels. Recognizing that our cold
atoms are sitting in a bath of room temperature thermal
photons, we can follow Einstein’s simple treatment [24] to
relate the spontaneous emission rates Aji to the thermal
transition rates ˜Bij(T ) = Bijρ(ωij, T ), where ρ(ωij, T )
is the blackbody photon energy density and Bij is the
Einstein B coeﬃcient. For the states labeled in the inset
of Fig. 3, we have

˜Bij(T ) =

gj
gi

Aji
e(Ej−Ei)/kB T − 1

,

(1)

where gi is the degeneracy of the ith level, Ei is the
energy of the ith level, and kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant. Taking the theoretical value for the decay along
3D1→3P0 of A21 = 1.6 × 103 s−1 [16] and the measured
energy diﬀerence of 638 cm−1 [12], we calculate a thermal
transition rate from 3P0→3D1 of ˜B12 = 2.2 × 102 s−1 for
our chamber temperature of T = 296(3) K. Therefore,
room temperature blackbody radiation can drive popu-
lation between these levels on millisecond time scales, as
indicated by the curved arrows in the inset of Fig. 3.

This blackbody radiation mechanism can be seen di-
rectly in the data shown in Fig. 3, where we show the

FIG. 4: Number of 225Ra and 226Ra atoms in the trap, as
measured by ﬂuorescence at 714 nm, vs. the wavenumber of
the 1429 nm repump laser recorded by the wavemeter. The
225Ra data is scaled by 100× to compare to 226Ra, which is

observed rate of repumping when shuttering and unshut-
tering the 1429 nm repump laser (ﬁlled circles) while the
MOT light (714 nm) is left on. This repumping rate
is measured directly as a function of time by recording
the number of repump-induced 483 nm photons detected
from the decay of the 1P1 level (as shown in Fig. 1).
When the repump laser is shuttered for the ﬁrst 5 ms,
population that leaks during laser-cooling accumulates in
the 3D1 level and, after radiative decay, in the metastable
3P0 level. When the repump laser is reapplied to the cold
atoms at t = 5 ms, the atoms residing in the 3D1 level are
quickly repumped and produce the short burst of 483 nm
photons seen in Fig. 3. The slowly decaying exponential
tail following this initial pulse corresponds to the emp-
tying of the metastable 3P0 level by thermal blackbody
radiation that reexcites the atoms to the 3D1 level where
they can be repumped by the 1429 nm laser. The signal
then settles to a steady-state repump rate.

These data are modeled eﬀectively by a double expo-
nential plus an oﬀset for t > 5 ms, shown by the solid
line in Fig. 3. The time scale for the ﬁrst exponential
corresponds to the laser repump rate and the time scale
for the second exponential corresponds to the blackbody
repump rate. This ﬁt yields a blackbody repump rate
of ˜B12 = 2.8 × 102 s−1, which, through Eqn. 1, yields a
lifetime for the 3D1 level of 510 ± 60 µs for our chamber
temperature. We interpret this as a lower limit on the
lifetime because other loss mechanisms from the 3P0 level
could contribute to the decay of this curve.

In practice, this blackbody mechanism eases the re-
quirements on the repumping laser ﬁelds because atoms
which decay from the 3D1 level to the metastable 3P0
level will be recycled to the 3D1 level by the thermal

radiation and be exposed to the repumping laser again.
This is particularly signiﬁcant for 225Ra, which can be
eﬃciently repumped by exciting from only one of the
hyperﬁne manifolds. Assuming a uniform population
of the 3P1(F = 3/2) mF states in the MOT, decay
to the 3D1(F = 3/2) states is favored 5 : 1 over de-
cay to the 3D1(F = 1/2) states.
If we repump only
the 3D1(F = 3/2) states, atoms which decay to the
3D1(F = 1/2) states will further decay to the metastable
3P0 level. But over the time scale of 4 ms, the atoms will
be recycled due to thermal radiation (as seen in Fig. 3
for 226Ra) to the (F = 3/2) states and repumped. This
eﬀect can also be seen in Fig. 4, which shows the number
of 225Ra and 226Ra atoms observed in the trap as a func-
tion of the tuning of the repump laser; the four lines for
225Ra correspond to (F = 1/2, 3/2) → (F ′ = 1/2, 3/2)
as indicated in the inset. While most eﬃcient along
(F = 3/2) → (F ′ = 3/2), repumping on any of the four
transitions leads to a signiﬁcant increase (10×-100×) in
the number of trapped 225Ra atoms.

By comparing the center frequencies of the 225Ra and
226Ra lines, we have measured the isotope shift on the
3D1→1P1 transition to be ν226 − ν225 = 540.2(2.0) MHz.
We have also extracted the hyperﬁne structure con-
stants A for 225Ra, where the hyperﬁne energy splitting
E(F = 3/2) − E(F = 1/2) = 3/2 hA. These values are
presented in Table I and compared with theory [11]. Our
measurement agrees well with the previous measurement
of A for the 1P1 state at ISOLDE [26, 27].

Figure 4 also shows that the 3D1→1P1 repump transi-
tion energy in 226Ra is measured to be 6999.84(2) cm−1.
This conﬁrms Russell’s 1934 adjustment [28] to the orig-
inal arc spectrum published by Rasmussen [23], which
shifted the D-level and F -level energies by +628 cm−1.
This measurement resolves the conﬂict between calcula-
tions which were consistent with the correction [15, 29]
and theoretical concerns that these levels could be much
lower in energy [30], which would have presented much
stronger leak channels from the 3P1 level and therefore
made laser-cooling signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult.
It also
suggests that the apparent near-degeneracy of the 3P1
and 3D2 levels [12] which would enhance atomic parity
violation eﬀects in radium should be correct [10, 11].

The successful laser trapping of 225Ra and 226Ra has
opened the possibility of studying fundamental symme-
tries with cold, trapped radium atoms. Furthermore, to

4

our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration that black-
body radiation can serve as an eﬀective repump source.
This mechanism may ﬁnd more uses in laser trapping of
atoms with complex structure [31]. In an EDM search,
we estimate that a statistical sensitivity of 10−26 e cm
can be achieved using a 10 mCi 225Ra source with the
demonstrated trapping eﬃciency. Due to radium’s en-
hanced sensitivity to nuclear T -violating interactions, a
search with this level of sensitivity would be competitive
with the best current limits set in the nuclear sector [1].

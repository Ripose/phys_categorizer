Abstract. Three-dimensional magnetic focusing of cold atoms with a single
magnetic impulse has been observed for the ﬁrst time. We load 7×107 85Rb
atoms into a magneto-optical trap, precool the atoms with optical molasses, then
use moving molasses to launch them vertically through 20.5 cm to the apex of
ﬂight. In transit the atoms are optically pumped, prior to the single magnetic
lens impulse that occurs 16.5 cm above the MOT. Fluorescence images at the apex
of ﬂight characterise the widths of the focussed cloud. Results were obtained for
four diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the baseball lens, which tuned the relationship
between the axial and radial frequencies of the lens. Compact focused clouds
were seen for all four conﬁgurations.

1. Introduction

Laser cooled atoms [1] are now extensively used in a range of experiments spanning
fundamental physics and technological applications. As the kinetic energy of ultracold
atoms is many orders of magnitude lower than conventional atomic beams, relatively
modest electromagnetic forces are now routinely used to gain complete control over
the external degrees of freedom of atomic motion. One technique of altering atomic
trajectories utilises the Zeeman interaction between an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
and the magnetic dipole moment of an atom. This Stern-Gerlach force can be used
to deﬂect, reﬂect and focus paramagnetic cold atoms [2].

Focused cold atoms, obtained using lenses or curved mirrors, are ideal for
applications like atom lithography [3] or loading miniature magnetic guides [4] and
atom chips [5]. Atom mirrors reverse the velocity component perpendicular to the
mirror surface and maintain the component parallel to the surface. In contrast, an
atom lens modiﬁes both the transverse and longitudinal velocity components. To date,
the Stern-Gerlach force has been used to realise ﬂat [6] and curved [7] permanent
atomic mirrors, and pulsed mirrors for both cold (thermal) [8] and Bose condensed
atoms [9]. Pulsed magnetic focusing of cold atoms in 3D was ﬁrst demonstrated
by Cornell et al. [10] using the alternate-gradient technique. The group of Gorceix

Experimental Single-Impulse Magnetic Focusing of Launched Cold Atoms

also performed an experimental and theoretical study of magnetic alternate-gradient
imaging of cold atoms [11].

We describe the ﬁrst experiment to focus fully a launched cloud of cold atoms
in 3D with a single magnetic lens impulse.
In comparison to an unfocused cloud,
the density of the cloud can be signiﬁcantly increased after magnetic focusing. The
remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of atomic
focusing; Section 3 outlines the theory and construction of the baseball lens; Section
4 discusses the experimental details; in Section 5 the results are presented; and in
Section 6 the results are analysed and conclusions are drawn.

2. An overview of the theory of atom focusing

′ =

Consider an atom which starts at the origin and moves along the x-direction with
velocity vx. In order to return the particle to the origin at time T , a single impulse
must be applied after a time λT (0 < λ < 1) at position x = λT vx changing the
atomic velocity to vx
(1−λ)T . For all velocities, the impulse needed
is proportional to the displacement of the atom when it is applied, i.e. a harmonic
potential is required. For an atom starting originally at x0, a similar analysis shows
that the ﬁnal position is
λ)/λ. Thus, for an ensemble of atoms with a
given initial distribution of x0 values, the spread in ﬁnal position is independent of
the velocity, i.e. a one-to-one image is formed with magniﬁcation (1
λ)/λ, exactly
analogous to the familiar result of (object distance)/(image distance) in ray optics.

The 1D parabolic lens analysis above assumed an instantaneous impulse; however,
extending the analysis to 3D and a ﬁnite-duration impulse is straightforward, and is
often done in the
-matrix formulation [11, 12, 13]. A ﬁnite-duration impulse
from a parabolic-potential lens yields a one-to-one image with no dependence on
velocity - we term this an aberration-free image. Aberrations arise as a consequence
of the departure of the lens potential from being parabolic.

ABCD

An atom in a magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude B experiences a magnetic dipole
interaction energy of U = mF gF µBB, where gF is the Land´e g-factor, mF is the
magnetic hyperﬁne level and µB is the Bohr magneton. For a magnetic lens, a
constant ﬁeld (a bias) does not inﬂuence the atomic trajectories, a ﬁeld gradient gives
atoms a uniform velocity kick, and a ﬁeld curvature is used for focusing. The lens
angular frequency, ω, along any particular direction for an atom of mass m is given
by ω2 = mF gF µBB2/m, where B2 is the ﬁeld curvature along the corresponding
direction. The approximate lens impulse duration, τ , applied at a relative time λT is
given by ω2T τ = (λ(1

λ))−1.

As it is impossible to create a static magnetic ﬁeld maximum [14], there is only
one strategy for producing a focused cloud with a single magnetic impulse – one
uses atoms in weak-ﬁeld-seeking-states, and a lens potential with a minimum at the
centre and positive curvature along all three Cartesian axes. This is essentially the
requirement for a magnetic trap, for which many designs exist. A magnetic trap/lens
also requires a non-zero minimum ﬁeld, to avoid spin-ﬂip losses [15]. In [12] we analysed
the aberrations expected from diﬀerent magnetic lenses and concluded that a baseball
lens would be ideal for achieving single-impulse three-dimensional focusing.

3. The Baseball Lens

The baseball lens is a variant of the Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap. Ioﬀe-Pritchard (IP) traps are
used extensively for atom trapping and are similar to the Ioﬀe conﬁguration utilised in
plasma conﬁnement [16]. Figure 1(a) shows the geometry. The baseball lens has two
components: a nine-turn baseball coil carrying a current I ′, and a pair of two-turn
circular bias coils which carry the same current I in the same sense. The baseball coil
consists of eight straight current-carrying segments of length w = 10 cm along x, y, and
ℓ = 10 cm along z. The bias coils have radius a = 5 cm and are separated by s = 5 cm.
The coils were constructed from enamel-coated 3 mm-diameter cylindrical copper wire
ﬁxed together with Araldite 2011 epoxy. Further details of the lens construction can
be obtained in [17]. The ratio of the axial and radial magnetic curvatures can be
tuned via the current ratio I/I ′. The bias ﬁeld is needed because it is impossible to
realise a 3D isotropic lens with a baseball coil alone.

Figure 1. Image (a) shows the baseball lens geometry. The baseball coil is made
from 8 straight current-carrying segments; a pair of circular coils provides a bias
ﬁeld.
Image (b) is the baseball lens circuit. The current pulse passes through
the baseball coil and then the bias coils in parallel with a tuning resistor RTUNE,
which is used to control the fraction of baseball current running through the bias
coils.

Four conﬁgurations of the baseball lens were used in this experiment, i.e.
ratios between the axial and radial curvatures. This was achieved using a tuning
resistor RTUNE to regulate the percentage of the total current that passed through
the bias coils. The circuit is depicted in Figure 1(b). A Mitsubishi CM1400DU-
24NF integrated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) was used to control the current
pulse. To prevent the truck batteries being short-circuited, if the IGBT were to blow
open, a 120 A fuse and 12 V solenoid switch were added as automatic and manual
safety measures, respectively. The reverse-biased protection diode across the IGBT is
inherent within the IGBT module. The reverse-biased Schottky diode (240NQ045) in
parallel with the load prevents oscillatory currents in the lens after switch-oﬀ. The
total current through the baseball coil and the current through the tuning resistor

RTUNE were measured using two Honeywell CSNK591 Hall eﬀect current sensors
(HECS in Figure 1(b)). The baseball and bias coils have resistances of 18 mΩ and
3 mΩ, with impedances of 32 µH and 2 µH, respectively. The turn on(oﬀ) time for the
current is

The baseball

lens was designed to run with hundreds of Amps for tens of
milliseconds; consequently, they were not water-cooled. However, a longer time is
needed to measure the ﬁeld they produce, and hence they were characterised with
a 10 A test current. The magnetic ﬁeld was measured using a Gauss meter with
a 1.8 mm diameter circular active area (Bell HTG4-0608) mounted on a translation
stage. Table 1 encapsulates the results of these measurements and compares them to
the expected values. The measured and theoretical values are in excellent agreement.

4. Experimental Setup

A custom-made stainless steel vacuum chamber was designed for the experiment. The
chamber had 12 ports, composed of two intersecting 6-way crosses. One cross had
two sets of orthogonal ports in the horizontal plane, and one vertical pair. The other
cross had 3 mutually orthogonal axes, symmetrically disposed about the vertical (at
an angle cos−1(1/√3)), along which the MOT beams propagated. The advantage of
this setup is that only two laser frequencies are required to achieve vertical moving
molasses. The chamber was pumped with a magnetically-shielded 40 L/s ion pump
10−11 Torr. The centre of a square-cross-section
and the background pressure was 9
glass cell was located approximately 20.5 cm above the MOT to enable the focused
atoms to be observed. Three pairs of mutually orthogonal magnetic ﬁeld coils were
used to cancel ambient magnetic ﬁelds in the chamber.

light was shared amongst the 6 MOT beams. The trapping and repumping beams
were produced by two separate grating-stabilized, external-cavity diode lasers locked
using polarisation spectroscopy [18, 19] with hyperﬁne pumping/saturated absorption
spectroscopy as a frequency reference [20, 21]. Rb vapour was provided by a SAES
Rb dispenser. The MOT magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld had an axial gradient of 15 G/cm.
After collection in the MOT, the atoms underwent a 10 ms 28 MHz-red-detuned
optical molasses stage with 25% trap laser intensity, which gave a temperature of
(25
2) µK. A ﬁnal frequency diﬀerence of δν = 1.48 MHz between the upwards
and downwards propagating laser beams then launched the atoms vertically in
moving molasses at a speed of 2.0 m/s. The frequency ramp of δν took 3 ms
and the ﬁnal value was held for a further 1 ms. These values were optimised by
studying images of the launched cloud up to 20 ms after the launch process. From
a mean of ﬁve measurements, the initial cloud standard deviations were discerned
0.01 mm. After launch, the atoms were
to be σx =1.01

state using a

transition. We were careful to ensure that the imaging pulse did not blur or displace
the image of the cloud by virtue of the radiation pressure exerted on the atoms. The
centre of the baseball lens was located 16.5
0.2 cm above the MOT. The unfocused
cloud came to rest in (approximately) the centre of the image. For each pulsed
magnetic lens duration, τ , the lens turn-on time was adjusted to centre the focused
cloud in the image, which was taken 204 ms after launch. The area seen in the image

5. Results and Analysis

Four diﬀerent lens conﬁgurations were realised, using diﬀerent values of RTUNE to
control the relative current in the bias coil and thus the radial:axial lens frequency
ratio. The parameters of these lens conﬁgurations (labelled ‘1,’ ‘2,’ ‘3,’ ‘4’) are shown
in Table 2.

the x-direction between 16 and 20 ms, and in the z-direction between 28 and 32 ms.
Three-dimensional focusing of a launched cloud with a single impulse from a baseball
lens is clearly seen.

x-focus decreases. The minimum measured value of the standard deviation in the
x-direction of a focused cloud was 2.43
0.07 mm, using lens conﬁguration 4 with a
pulse duration τ = 8 ms. The minimum measured value of the standard deviation in
the z-direction of a focused cloud was 4.57

a pulse duration of τ = 36 ms. For all four lens conﬁgurations, the minimum radial

5.1. Analysis of cloud size for diﬀerent lens conﬁgurations

-
Two methods of predicting the expected cloud size were employed. First, an
ABCD
matrix analysis was carried out, characterising the lens as being perfectly parabolic
with a ﬁnite-duration impulse. This analysis is easy to perform, but as we pointed out
in [12], the limit of the validity of the assumptions underlying this method are unlikely
to extend to a realistic experiment. The second method is a brute-force numerical
simulation of the trajectories of many atoms subject to the forces of gravity and a
pulsed Stern-Gerlach force. In this model, the magnetic ﬁeld was calculated by taking
the baseball coil to be constructed from eight equal-length, straight, inﬁnitesimally-
3 array
thin conductors, which ignored the ﬁnite extent of the conductors in the 3
of the real lens. The bias coils were modelled as single current loops, rather than the
2-turn coils in the experimental lens. Further details of the numerical simulation can
be found in [12]. Figure 4 compares the experimentally obtained cloud size along the
x-direction with the matrix and numerical simulations.

For the matrix analysis, the initial cloud position and standard deviation are
required as input - these were deduced from experimental measurements. It is then
possible to obtain analytic predictions for the cloud-size dependence on τ as a function
of ωx. A least-squares comparison of the data and matrix prediction were made, and
the results are summarised in table 3. The values for ωx deduced from the experimental
data are seen to be in good agreement with those predicted from knowledge of the
geometry and currents passed through the baseball lens.

Although the radial frequencies deduced are in good agreement with the expected
values, the matrix analysis consistently predicts minimum cloud sizes which are
smaller than those measured experimentally. The numerical analysis is seen to show
far better agreement with the minimum cloud size. This conﬁrms the predictions
presented in [12] that aberrations arising from terms beyond the ideal parabolic lens

Experimental Single-Impulse Magnetic Focusing of Launched Cold Atoms

approximation are signiﬁcant.

A similar analysis was performed for the size of the cloud measured along the
z-direction. However, as the data do not show good agreement with either the matrix
or numerical simulations we do not present the analysis here. Numerical simulations
show that the focusing properties in the z-direction are far more sensitive to slight
misalignment of the centre of the cloud with respect to the centre of the lens than for
the radial direction.

6. Conclusions

Three-dimensional magnetic focusing of cold atoms with a single-impulse magnetic
lens has been observed for the ﬁrst time. Results were obtained for four diﬀerent
conﬁgurations of the baseball lens, which varied the relationship between the axial
and radial angular frequencies of the lens. Compact focused clouds were seen for all
four conﬁgurations.
-matrix analysis of the experimental data for the variation
of the focused cloud size was in good agreement for the horizontal (x) direction, but
did not account for the behaviour of the focused cloud in the vertical (z) direction.
Numerical simulations showed very good agreement with the horizontal cloud size,
but were not able to account fully for the behaviour of the cloud size in the direction
in which the atom cloud had been launched. The complex issue of the discrepancy
between the predictions (both analytical and numerical) for vertical cloud size and
the obtained experimental data is an ongoing investigation.

ABCD

In addition to a study of atom focusing, these results present a method of
transferring cold atoms from a MOT to a remote vacuum chamber. This method
can be compared to two other magnetic transfer mechanisms. It is possible to load
atoms into a magnetic trap in one chamber and magnetically transport the atoms into
a remote chamber using either time-dependent currents in an array of static coils [22]
or trap coils mounted on a motorised stage [23]. The disadvantage of a scheme with
static coils is the large number of coils and power supplies required, and the time-
dependent currents. Initial experiments with moving coils used a three-dimensional
quadrupole trap, which has a magnetic zero at its centre. For certain applications,
a trap with a ﬁnite minimum is required, and recently transport of atom packets
in a train of Ioﬀe-Pritchard traps was demonstrated [24]. Using moving coils does,
however, place limitations on vacuum chamber design since suﬃcient space must be
allowed for the translation mechanism. The pulsed magnetic lens presented in this
work needs, realistically, only space for the lens itself. In contrast to this work, there is
no signiﬁcant increase in cloud size with the two magnetic transport schemes described
above; however, in theory a pulsed magnetic lens could result in a bimodal focus with
a very tightly focused 3D core of atoms, denser than the initial distribution, as shown
in [13]. The combination of pulsed magnetic focusing combined with laser guiding
looks promising [25]

In this work, spatial focusing was considered. A possible future extension would
be to study velocity focusing, and recently a Ioﬀe-Pritchard lens was used for this
purpose [26]. A wavepacket with a very narrow momentum distribution is ideal for
studying quantum tunnelling, and a 1-dimensional narrow momentum distribution
could also be useful for other atom optics experiments, such as studying quantum
accelerator modes.

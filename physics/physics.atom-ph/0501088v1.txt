Abstract. Collisional and thermal ionization of sodium nS and nD Rydberg atoms
with n=8-20 has been studied. The experiments were performed using a two-
step pulsed laser excitation in an eﬀusive atomic beam at atom density of about

created mainly due to photoionization of Rydberg atoms by photons of blackbody
radiation at the ambient temperature of 300K. Blackbody ionization rates and eﬀective
lifetimes of Rydberg states of interest were determined. The molecular ions were
found to be from associative ionization in Na(nL)+Na(3S) collisions. Rate constants
of associative ionization have been measured using an original method based on relative
measurements of Na+

2 and Na+ ion signals.

1. Introduction

Collisional ionization of atoms may often be associated with highly excited quasi-
molecular systems, which are formed temporarily in course of the collision. Such quasi-
molecules may, at certain internuclear distances, couple to the ionization continuum and
emit an electron. Depending on the total excitation energy of the system and relative
positioning of the covalent and ionic molecular potential curves, the quasi-molecule may
end up as a stable molecular ion (associative ionization), or ionize and dissociate into
an atomic ion and a neutral atom (Penning process). Conventional theory [1, 2, 3]
treats such processes deterministically in terms of interaction of a few covalent bound
states with the ionization continuum.
In the reality, however, the incoming covalent
state interacts with a large number of other molecular Rydberg states. Moreover, since
the density of Rydberg states is very high, it may be impossible to single out separate
interactions between two Rydberg states at a time. Obviously, under such conditions it
is not practicable to apply the exact quantum mechanical description. This drawback
of the deterministic description of ionization dynamics can be overcome by involving a
new alternative approach, the so-called stochastic ionization model [4].

The stochastic model describes the collisions with Rydberg atoms as a chaotic
migration of highly excited electron accompanying the motion of both colliding nuclei.
The electron “diﬀuses” through the dense energy spectrum of the highly excited quasi-
molecule, eventually ending up in the ionization continuum. The stochastic theory
has already yielded encouraging results by properly describing some of the earlier
experimental results on associative ionization involving Rydberg atoms [5, 6, 7].

The aim of the present work was to test experimentally the ranges of validity of
the stochastic theory developed in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. For this purpose, we studied the
ionizing collisions of sodium Rydberg atoms Na(nL) with atoms in the 3S ground state
Na(3S). In what follows we describe the measurements of ionization signals occurring
after excitation of sodium atoms to nS and nD Rydberg states with n=8-20 in a single
atomic beam at a source temperature of 635 K. To the best of our knowledge, there are
no data in the literature on ionization of sodium atoms in nS and nD states for this
range of principal quantum numbers. In particular, the processes of interest are:

Na(nL) + Na(3S) → Na+

2 + e

Associative Ionization (AI);

Na(nL) + Na(3S) → Na+ + Na(3S) + e Penning Ionization (PI);

where Na+ is an atomic ion, and Na+

2 is a molecular ion.
The earlier experiments on collisional ionization of Na Rydberg atoms are reported
in [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The measurements of absolute rate constants have been done
in [9] for nP states (n = 5 − 15) in a crossed beam experiment at source temperatures
of 600 K and pulsed laser excitation. The rate constants for nP states (n = 5 − 21)

in a single atomic beam at 700 K source temperature and continuous excitation were
reported in [10, 11]. The measurements for nS, nP, and nL(L > 1) states (n = 17 − 27)
in a single Na beam at 1000 K and pulsed laser excitation have been made in [12]. The
use of pulsed excitation in [9, 12] allowed the authors to distinguish between AI and PI
channels and to determine the AI rate constants alone, while only the total (AI+PI)
rates could be measured in [10, 11]. The compilation of the AI rates from [9, 12] is
shown in ﬁgure 1. It exhibits a maximum in the AI rate constant for Na(nP) states
near n=12. Similar dependences on the principal quantum number were observed in
experiments with other alkali Rydberg atoms [15]. Comparison of these data with the
theory of [1, 2, 3] has shown a remarkable disagreement of the absolute values and shapes
of experimental and theoretical n dependences. Therefore new experiments and further
development of the theory are necessary.

One can see from ﬁgure 1 that no experimental data for sodium nS and nD states
with n < 17 are available. Meanwhile, the range of n = (8 − 20) is of particular interest,
since this is where the maximum in the ionization rate is expected. In addition, S and
D states have diﬀerent quantum defects and orbits of electron motion from those of P
states, and the n dependences for S and D states may be considerably diﬀerent.

One of the main diﬃculties in measurements of AI rates for nS and nD states at
low n is related with their short lifetimes. According to the calculations of Theodosiou
[16], radiative lifetimes of the 10S and 10D states are about 0.9 µs, while the lifetime
of the 10P state is about 8 µs, which is by an order of magnitude larger. Since one
must usually provide a suﬃciently long time (1-2 µs) for the collisional interaction of

Collisional and thermal ionization of sodium Rydberg atoms I

Rydberg and ground-state atoms in experiments, care must be taken to renormalize the
ionization signals and thus to account for the short lifetimes.

Experimental data on eﬀective lifetimes of most of the Rydberg states are lacking,
therefore they must be accurately calculated. Such calculations should take into account
the fact that lifetimes are aﬀected by blackbody radiation (BBR), which is always present
It induces transitions between neighboring Rydberg states and
in the experiments.
shortens the eﬀective lifetimes [17]. Moreover, BBR may photoionize Rydberg atoms and
contribute Na+ ions to the measured collisional signals. Our numerical calculations have
shown (see summary Table 1 in Section 4 below) that the rate of direct photoionization
by BBR is as high as 1147 s−1 for the 17D state at the ambient temperature T =300
K, so that the measured Na+ signals in room-temperature experiments are rather due
to the BBR photoionization than due to the PI. This eﬀect was studied experimentally
earlier in [13, 14, 18], while numerical calculations of direct BBR photoionization rates
were performed in [18, 19]. Experimental measurements of BBR photoionization rates
for various n were reported only for barium Rydberg atoms [20].

In order to decrease the BBR in the experiments with Rydberg atoms, special
thermal shields cooled by vacuum cryostats are often used. However, this method
does not allow a precise determination of the eﬀective temperature and density of
blackbody photons. Even with liquid nitrogen or helium cooled shielding, the blackbody
photons can penetrate into the reaction zone from the hot atomic beam source (oven)
or through openings in the detection system. Although our setup was equipped with a
nitrogen cryostat, we decided to work without cooling for the sake of exact knowledge
of temperature and frequency distribution of BBR photons. Under such conditions,
reliable measurements of PI rates were impossible because the expected Na+ signals
due to PI were much smaller than those from BBR photoionization.

At the same time, the BBR photoionization signals may be calculated or measured
and serve as a reference for measurements of the AI rates. In this case, however, the
mixing of neighboring Rydberg states by BBR must also be taken into account, because
it may signiﬁcantly redistribute the populations of excited states during the interaction
time [21, 22]. Note that the AI rates can still be extracted directly from the measured
Na+
2 signals, since the BBR photoionization leads only to the formation of Na+ ions and
does not aﬀect the Na+

2 signals.

2. Experiment

Experimental setup was similar to that used for microwave spectroscopy of Na Rydberg
atoms [23]. Experiments were performed with a single eﬀusive Na atomic beam in a
vacuum chamber at background pressure of 5·10−7 Torr (ﬁgure 2). The temperature
of the Na oven was stabilized at 635 K. The atomic beam was formed by expansion of
sodium vapor through a 2 mm dia opening in the oven at a distance of 9 cm from the
reaction zone. Collimation of the beam was achieved by a metallic shield with 1.5 mm
dia aperture located 4 cm upstream from the excitation volume. The eﬀective diameter

of the atomic beam in this volume was about 4 mm.

The metallic shield screened the most of thermal radiation of the oven. This shield
and other parts of the vacuum chamber surrounding the reaction zone were kept at
room temperature, ensuring an isotropic 300 K environment. The estimated ﬂux of
”hot” BBR photons originating from the beam source and penetrating through the
collimating aperture contributed to less than 1% of the total BBR ionization rate in the
reaction zone, and it was therefore disregarded in the data analyses.

Sodium nS and nD Rydberg states were excited using the two-step scheme
3S1/2 →3P3/2 →nS, nD by radiation of two tunable lasers pulsed at 5 kHz repetition
rate. In the ﬁrst step, 50 ns pulses from a Rhodamine 6G dye-laser with linewidth of 50
GHz were used. They saturated the 3S1/2 →3P3/2 transition at 589 nm. The resonance
ﬂuorescence on this transition was detected by a photomultiplier to monitor the relative
changes in density of the atomic beam. In the second step, the second harmonic of a
Ti-sapphire laser was used. It yielded 50 ns pulses with 10 GHz linewidth, tunable in the
400-455 nm range. When not focused, this radiation did not saturate the 3P3/2 →nS,nD
transitions. The two laser beams were crossed at a right angle in the reaction zone, both
of them crossing the atomic beam at an angle of 45◦. Laser beam proﬁles were spatially
limited by 2 mm dia apertures at the entrance windows of the vacuum chamber. Such
conﬁguration ensured a suﬃciently small excitation volume of 2 mm size in the central
part of the atomic beam, where the spatial variation of atom density was insigniﬁcant
(<20%).

The ion detection system shown in ﬁgure 2 used a channeltron multiplier VEU − 6.

The atomic beam passed between two stainless-steel plates with diameter of 70 mm
each, spaced by 10 mm. The plates formed a homogeneous electric ﬁeld to guide the
ions from the reaction zone through the entrance window of the channeltron. The
extraction electric ﬁeld pulses of 100 V/cm amplitude and 250 ns duration were applied
to the upper plate. The lower plate was grounded and had a 6 mm dia opening covered
by a mesh with the transmittance of 70%. The ions that passed through the mesh were
accelerated by the electric ﬁeld of the channeltron to energies of about 3.5 keV. This
energy was suﬃcient to detect the ions with probability close to unity.

A special microwave-spectroscopy experiment, similar to that described in [23],
has proven that the electric ﬁeld from the channeltron very weakly penetrated into the
interaction region through the ﬁne mesh of the lower ionization plate, as well as other
stray electric ﬁelds. The measured Stark shift of the microwave transition 37S→37P
was about 4 MHz, corresponding to the <0.3 V/cm stray electric ﬁeld. This ﬁeld had
no eﬀect on our measurements or on Rydberg states under study.

Single ion output pulses of the channeltron were ampliﬁed, discriminated, and
registered by two gated counters. The measurements were performed in the pulse
counting regime, keeping the frequencies of the detected ion signals much lower (0.2-
1 kHz) than the 5 kHz repetition rate of laser pulses. On average, less than one ion per
laser shot was detected. The measured frequencies of ion signals were determined as the
total number of ions detected during the measurement time of 10 s, i.e., signals were
counted for 50000 laser pulses. In order to ensure the single-ion counting regime, the
intensity of the laser driving the second excitation step was attenuated with calibrated
neutral density ﬁlters by a factor of 10 to 100.

The present study concentrated on measurements of relative dependence of
ionization rate constants on the principal quantum number n of Rydberg states, and
it did not require precise knowledge of absolute values of the number density n 3S of
the ground-state Na(3S) atoms in the beam.
It was therefore calculated from the
geometry of the eﬀusive beam and the Nesmeyanov’s formula [24] relating temperature
and pressure of saturated Na vapor in the beam source. This formula coincides to
within better than 50% with other available data, for example, [25]. Monitoring of
the ﬂuorescence on the saturated resonance transition showed that the atomic number
density was almost constant during the experiments. The temperature of the oven was
measured by a calibrated thermocouple with an accuracy of ±2 K. Taking into account
all the uncertainties, we estimate the absolute number density of atoms in the reaction
zone as n 3S=(2±0.7)×1010 cm−3 at the oven temperature of T =(635±2) K.

The time sequence of excitation and detection pulses is illustrated in ﬁgure 3.
Two identical electric ﬁeld pulses with the 100 V/cm amplitude and 250 ns duration
(ﬁgure 3(b)) were applied to the repelling plate after each laser excitation pulse
(ﬁgure 3(a)).

The ﬁrst electric pulse was applied immediately after the laser pulse to remove the
atomic and molecular ions produced during the laser pulse. These ions were always
observed in our experiments, even at non-resonant excitation by the ﬁrst-step (yellow )

laser only. Their origin was investigated in many earlier studies, which identiﬁed them
to be due to mutiphoton ionization of Na2 dimers by yellow laser [26, 27] (dimers are
always present in an eﬀusive beam at an amount of ∼(0.1-1)%), due to photoassociative
ionization of Na(3P) atoms by yellow laser [28, 29, 30], and due to photoionization of
Rydberg Na(nL) atoms by the resonant radiation of yellow and blue lasers. These ions
represent an undesirable background to the collisional-ionization signals from Rydberg
atoms, and therefore the ﬁrst electric pulse was required to clean up the reaction zone
from any ions created during the laser excitation.

The second electric pulse extracted to the channeltron those ions, which were
produced in the time interval between t 1=0.3 µs and t 2=2.1 µs after the laser excitation
pulse. These ions corresponded to the collisional and BBR photoionization of Rydberg
atoms. In the mass spectrum detected by the channeltron, the signals of the atomic
Na+ and the molecular Na+
ions were separated by 0.6 µs and thus well resolved
2
(ﬁgure 3(c)). Gated pulse counters registered the signals of the atomic and molecular
ions independently (ﬁgure 3(d)).

3. Determination of collisional rate constants

3.1. Rate equations

The registered Na+ and Na+
2 ion signals result from ionization occurring in the reaction
zone during the time interval (t 2-t 1)=1.8 µs between the two extraction electric ﬁeld
pulses. This time is comparable with the lifetimes of Rydberg states; therefore, time
evolution of ionization processes must be analyzed. The main processes leading to the
formation of Na+ ions are Penning ionization and photoionization by BBR. The Na+
2
ions can be created only in the associative ionization. Contribution of the collisions with
background gases can be safely disregarded. We have veriﬁed experimentally that the
variation of background pressure within the range of 5·10−7 ≤ P ≤ 1·10−6 Torr did not
aﬀect the measured Na+ and Na+
2 signals by more than 5%. Under such conditions, the
rate equations describing the evolution of the numbers of Na+ and Na+

(cid:1)

The eﬀective lifetime τef f describing the decay of Rydberg states in equation (2)
is determined by the spontaneous lifetime and the rate of other processes depleting the
laser excited Rydberg state. These include BBR induced transitions between Rydberg
states, BBR induced photoionization, and collisional quenching. The results of our
numeric calculations of the rates of these processes will be given in Section 4 and
summarized in Table 1.

The depletion of Rydberg states with n=8-20 by collisional ionization is negligible
at atom densities used in the present experiment. We ﬁnd from ﬁgure 1 that the rate of
associative ionization, k AIn 3S, does not exceed 50 s−1 and is therefore much smaller than

Collisional and thermal ionization of sodium Rydberg atoms I

9

the spontaneous decay rates, which range from 105 to 106 s−1 for the studied Rydberg
states. The rate of PI, k P In 3S, is expected to be below 10 s−1 for n∼20, and close to zero
for lower n. Comparing the PI rate with the direct BBR photoionization rate W BBR
(Table 1), one can see that Na+ ions are produced mainly in the BBR photoionization.
As will be shown below, this seemingly undesirable background ionization process can
be favorably exploited for the determination of absolute AI rate constants.

With the above considerations in mind, the solution of equations (1) can be written

as

where t ef f is the eﬀective time of interaction that takes into account the short radiative
lifetimes of Rydberg states:

tef f = τef f [exp (−t/τef f ) − exp (−t/τef f )] .

Here, t 1 and t 2 are the time moments marking the end of the ﬁrst and the beginning of
the second extraction electric ﬁeld pulses, respectively (see ﬁgure 3(b)).

3.2. Method of measurements

Equations(4) can be used for the direct measurement of k AI and W BBR values, provided
that N nL(0) is known. The only reliable method to measure N nL(0) is the Selective
Field Ionization (SFI) technique [31]. Rydberg atoms ionize in an electric ﬁeld with
probability close to unity if the ﬁeld strength has reached the critical value E c. The
latter depends strongly on the eﬀective quantum number n ef f =(n-δL), where δL is the
quantum defect (1.348 for nS states and 0.015 for nD states):

Ec ≈ 3.2 · 108n−4
ef f

(V /cm)

Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to apply the SFI method for Rydberg states with low n, since
they require too strong electric ﬁeld (∼30 kV/cm for n∼10). In the present study we
were interested mainly in relative measurements of k AI for various n. Therefore we could
use a normalization procedure for N nL(0) based on numerically calculated excitation
. Since the 3S1/2 →3P3/2 transition was saturated, N nL(0)
probabilities W
was dependent only on the respective transition moments and power of the blue laser.
In the absence of saturation at the second excitation step (this was the case in our
experiments), the probability of excitation of Rydberg states from the 3P3/2 state can
be written as

may vary between the values of 3.5 and 5.

(cid:0)
In order to compare the absolute signals due to BBR and collisional ionization of
S states with those of D states, it is necessary to know also the ratio C D/C S. The
analysis of angular parts of the transition matrix elements, taking into account the
hyperﬁne structure, showed that for excitation with linearly polarized light in the ﬁrst
and the second excitation steps, the ratio C D/C S may vary from approximately 1.6
(if there is no collisional, radiative, or magnetic ﬁeld mixing of the magnetic sublevels)
to 2 (if the level mixing is complete). For excitation by non-polarized light, the ratio
always equals to 2 regardless the degree of level mixing. Finally, we ﬁnd that the ratio

In principle, one could normalize the ion signals measured for diﬀerent nL states
(cid:1)
and measuring only the power P b of
3P3/2 → nL

the blue laser radiation in equation (7). However, the applicability of such normalization
may be complicated by technical imperfections of the blue laser. Since the linewidth
of this laser (10 GHz) was much larger than the widths of the absorption proﬁles at
the second excitation step (∼500 MHz Doppler broadening), variations of the spectral
density of laser radiation could aﬀect the probability of excitation even if P b would
be kept constant. Therefore we had to verify experimentally the applicability of
normalization by equation (7). As discussed above, the only reliable way to measure the
number of Rydberg atoms was to apply the SFI technique. For this purpose, we built
a high-voltage generator yielding pulses with rise time of 1 µs and amplitude of up to
8 kV. This allowed us to ﬁeld-ionize Rydberg states with n≥17. The SFI signals were
detected at a 1 µs delay with respect to the laser pulse, i.e., the measured SFI signal
was:

(8)

Equation(8) was used to derive N nL(0) from the measured SFI signals and the
calculated values τef f of Table 1. Figure 4 shows the measured N nL(0) dependences on
the principal quantum number n for nS and nD states. These data are normalized on
P b, because it varied as blue laser frequency was tuned to resonance with diﬀerent nL
states. The solid curves are approximations made using equation (7). It is seen that
experimental points have noticeable deviations from theory although the general trend
is correct. These deviations may be explained by the variations of spectral density of
blue laser light. We concluded that equation (7) can be used for the normalization of
N nL(0), but at price of limited accuracy. We also ﬁnd from ﬁgure 4 that on average the
ratio W (3P3/2 →nD)/W (3P3/2 →nS) was close to 3.5. Hence, no considerable mixing
of the magnetic sublevels took place during the laser excitation, and the ratio C D/C S
was close to 1.6.

Since SFI technique was not applicable for the direct determination of N nL(0) for
n=8-17, the use of equation (7) was somewhat inadequate in our experiment. Therefore
ways had to be found to eliminate this value from the determination of rate constants.
This can be done by measuring the ratio R of atomic and molecular signals derived from
equations (4):

This ratio does not depend on the values of N nL(0), τef f and t ef f . Thus, the rate
constant of the AI process can be directly obtained from the measured ratio of the Na+
2
and Na+ signals:

The BBR ionization rates W BBR have thus become one of the key values necessary
for the determination of the AI rate constants. The accuracy with which the W BBR
values are known directly aﬀect the accuracy of the experimental k AI values obtained
using equation (10). Therefore, the process of BBR ionization must be examined in all
details.

4. BBR ionization rates

4.1. Direct BBR photoionization and eﬀective lifetimes

First, we have numerically calculated the eﬀective lifetimes τef f and the rates W BBR
of direct BBR photoionization of nS and nD Rydberg states of Na with n=8-20 at the

formula (here and below the atomic units are used) [18]:

where c is the speed of light, ωnL = 1/

where k is the Boltzmann constant. For isotropic and non-polarized thermal radiation

and photoelectron energy E :

where Lmax is the largest of L and L′. The values of R (nL → E, L ± 1) were calculated
numerically using the semi-classical formulae of Dyachkov and Pankratov [32]. Their
method gives orthogonal and normalized continuum wavefunctions, and the calculated
photoionization cross-sections were found to be in good agreement with the more
sophisticated quantum-mechanical calculations for nS states by Aymar [33]. Other
theoretical methods developed in [34, 35] give close results. High-precision values of
quantum defects of Dyubko et al [36] were used in our calculations.

In order to determine the eﬀective lifetimes of nL states, the radial matrix elements
R (nL → n′L′) of all dipole transitions to other n′L′ states with L′ = L ± 1) were also
calculated using the quasi-classical formulae of [32]. The rate of a speciﬁc BBR-induced
transition between the states nL and n′L′ are given by:

where ωnn′ = 1/(2n2) − 1/(2n′2) is the frequency of the transition. The total decay
rates were obtained by summing the probabilities of all spontaneous and BBR-induced
transitions. The results of numerical calculations of W BBR and eﬀective lifetimes at
T =300K are presented in Table 1.

4.2. BBR-induced mixing of Rydberg states

Earlier studies of BBR-induced processes have revealed that BBR causes not only
direct photoionization to the continuum [18], but also induces transitions in the discrete
spectrum [21, 22]. In our case, several discrete nP and nF levels are populated from
the initially excited nS and nD states during the interaction time. For example, after
laser excitation of the 16S state, the BBR-induced transitions populate the neighboring

n′P states (ﬁgure 5(a)). These states have signiﬁcantly larger W BBR values than that
of the 16S state, so that population transfer to the n′P states may aﬀect the resultant
BBR photoionization signal. As an example, the calculated rates of spontaneous and
BBR-induced transitions from the 16S and the 16D states to the n′P states are shown
in ﬁgures 5(b) and 5(c).

Another feature is that BBR also induces transitions to high Rydberg states
(ﬁgure 5(a)), which are ﬁeld ionized by the second electric ﬁeld pulse extracting the
ions to channeltron for detection. This 100 V/cm pulse ionizes Rydberg states with n ≥

states are populated at rates comparable with the direct photoionization rate WBBR
given in Table 1. Since all the states above nc = 40 are ﬁeld ionized, all BBR populated
states with n′ ≥40 will contribute to the detected Na+ ion signal. The total rate WR
of BBR transitions to all Rydberg states with n′ ≥ 40 was calculated by summing the
individual nL → n′L′ contributions given by equation (14):

WR =

W (nL → n′L′).

Xn′≥40 XL′=L±1

(15)

Collisional and thermal ionization of sodium Rydberg atoms I

15

The calculated WR values are given in Table 1. Note, that these ionization rates
amount to between 30 to 50 % of the direct photoionization rate values, WBBR, and
they obviously cannot be ignored.

Another kind of processes that may also lead to the redistribution of populations
between Rydberg states is nL mixing in collisions with the abundant ground state atoms.
However, the estimated rates of this process for a beam of density n3S ≈ 2 × 1010 cm−3
produced by a source at 635 K were found to be much lower than the rates of spontaneous
and BBR-induced transitions. Therefore the contribution of collisional nL mixing can
be safely disregarded.

4.3. Total BBR ionization rates

When the rates of redistribution of population over n′L′ Rydberg states following laser
excitation of a single nL Rydberg level are known, the total ionization rate leading to
the production of Na+ ions can be calculated. Assume that some nS state is initially
laser excited. If the rate of Penning ionization is negligible, the production of Na+ ions
is described by the rate equation

d Na+ (t)
d t

= W nS

BBRNnS (t) +

W n′P

BBRNn′P (t).

(16)

Here, W nS
BBR = WBBR +WR is the total BBR ionization rate of the laser excited nS state,
and it consists of two contributions: the direct BBR photoionization rate WBBR of the
nS state given by equation (11), and the rate WR of equation (15) for BBR induced
excitation of states with n ≥ 40, which are subsequently ﬁeld ionized by the second
extraction ﬁeld pulse. The main contributions to the sum in equation (16) are those of
n′P states with n′ = n, (n − 1), which are the nearest neighbors to the initial nS state
(see ﬁgures 5(b) and 5(c)). The time evolution of the number of n′P atoms is described
as follows:

Xn′

Solving equations (16) and (17), we obtained the total eﬀective ionization rate of the
Na(nS) atoms:

except that Wmix accounted for the transitions to both n′P and n′F states. Results of
numerical calculations using the semi-classical formulae for matrix elements from [32]
are summarized in Table 1.

4.4. Comparison of theory and experiment for BBR ionization rates

Experimental and theoretical data on the total BBR photoionization rates are compared
in ﬁgure 6. The solid curves are the theoretical values of W tot
BBR from Table 1. The
squares and circles are the corresponding experimental values W exp
BBR obtained using
equations (4) and (7) (in equation (4) the value of W BBR was replaced with W tot
BBR).
Experimental data were averaged over 5 measurements. The normalization coeﬃcient
C D in equation (7) was the only parameter whose absolute value was adjusted to ﬁt the
experiment to the theory. A good agreement between the experimental and theoretical
data was found for nD states (ﬁgure 6(b)). However, the data for nS states, obtained
with the ratio C D/C S=1.6 measured earlier, exhibit considerable discrepancies for states
with higher n (ﬁgure 6(a)), while a better agreement for states with lower n is seen.
The values of W exp
BBR by 2.1 times for n=20, and the shape
of the experimental n dependence is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the theoretical one.

BBR exceed the values of W tot

One possible explanation of such anomaly for nS states is related to their speciﬁc
orbit that penetrates into the atomic core. The penetration causes a strong interaction
between the Rydberg electron and the core, e.g., due to core polarization [33]. This
results in a large quantum defect and in a Cooper minimum in the photoionization cross-
sections. Each nS state has its individual photoionization cross-section and position of
the Cooper minimum. The accuracy of theoretical frequency-dependent cross-section
values aﬀects the total BBR ionization rate when integration over the Planck distribution
in equation (11) is performed. It is likely that the accuracy of theoretical models for nS
states is aﬀected by diﬃculties to account for the core penetration. This assumption is
supported by good agreement of theory and experiment for the hydrogen-like nD states,
which have a small quantum defect and an almost non-penetrating orbit.

We conclude that our theoretical calculations of W tot

BBR are correct to better than

New more accurate calculations of S state ionization rates are required if equation (10)
is to be used for the determination of absolute AI rate constants k AI for nS states.
However, such calculations require development of new approaches that are not yet
available for Rydberg states. Until new theoretical data become available, we rely on
our experimental data for nS states instead of theoretical BBR ionization rates. The
experimental values of W exp
BBR are summarized in the last column of Table 1. These are
our recommended values of the BBR ionization rates at 300 K, which should be used in
equation (10).

5. Experimental results for associative ionization rate constants

5.1. Ratio of molecular and atomic ion signals

Figure 7 shows the ratio R of equation (9) averaged over eight independent
measurements at the density of atoms in the atomic beam n 3S=2×1010 cm−3. For
the lowest states, the values of R reach 2.5 and 1.4 for nS and nD states, respectively.
In both cases, R drops oﬀ rapidly and asymptotically approaches the value of 0.06 for
highest n.

Such nearly constant n dependence of R at higher n was unexpected. In order to
verify whether the origin of the measured signal is collisional, the dependence of R on
the atomic beam density was measured for low (9D and 10S) and high (19S and 18D)
Rydberg states (ﬁgure 8). For the 9D and 10S states, R has a linear dependence on
n 3S, and hence the Na+
2 signal has a quadratic one. For 18D and 19S states, R is almost
independent of n 3S, hence the dependence of Na+
2 is linear. This means that for high
n the apparent Na+
2 signal was not due to the associative ionization. Instead, it was

proportional to Na+ signal, and should be therefore considered as some kind of technical
noise originating from Na+ ions.

Analysis of the experimental arrangement used in the present study has shown that
the noise was related to the Na+ ions produced during the second extraction electric
ﬁeld pulse (ﬁgure 3(b)). The pulse acted on these ions for a shorter time than on
Na+ ions produced before the electric pulse. Therefore, the former ions reached the
channeltron at a later time than the latter ones. As a result, the detection gate, which
was set for registration of the molecular ions, counted also the Na+ ions produced during
the second extraction ﬁeld pulse. This noise could not be eliminated by any technical
means, and unavoidably had to be subtracted from the total ion signal counted during
the molecular ion registration gate, although it was never reported in earlier experiments.
The magnitude of this noise signal can be expressed by the formula

Nnoise = NnL (0) W tot

BBR e−t2/τef f ∆t,

(20)

where ∆t is the time interval of the second electric extraction pulse, during which those
Na+ ions are created, which can fall into the gate for molecular ions, and the time t 2
corresponds to the beginning of the extraction pulse. The noise is proportional to W tot
BBR,
which grows rapidly with increasing n (ﬁgure 6). The time interval ∆t was calculated

Collisional and thermal ionization of sodium Rydberg atoms I

19

from the geometry of the detection system and the duration of the gate counting the
molecular ions, and it was found to be about 150 ns. To ﬁnd the contribution α of the
noise to the value of R, equation (20) must be divided by equation (4) for Na+ ions:

When this contribution is known,

in
Na(nL)+Na(3S) collisions can be extracted from the experimental ratios R of the
molecular and atomic ion signals using equation (10) modiﬁed by the correction α of

The values of α for nS and nD states were calculated using equation (21).
For highest n of the experiment they practically coincide with the measured ratios
(ﬁgure 8(c) and 8(d))

5.2. AI rate constants

The experimental dependences of k AI on n ef f were obtained from equation (22) using the
measured ratios of Na+
2 and Na+ signals and the data of Table 1. These dependences are
shown in ﬁgure 9. For the sake of completeness, we present two sets of results. Figure
9(a) shows the rate constants determined with the experimental values W tot
BBR of the
BBR ionization rate, while ﬁgure 9(b) shows the same but using the theoretical W exp
BBR
values. The plots in both ﬁgures are nearly identical, except for some minor diﬀerences
in the absolute values of k AI. Noteworthy, all dependences show the maximum in the
AI rate near nef f ≈ (11 − 12), and fall oﬀ rapidly with increasing n ef f .

Comparing our results with those of earlier AI studies, shown in ﬁgure 1, we see
a noticeable diﬀerence with the earlier data of [12] on k AI for nS and nD states which
were also obtained in a single beam experiment: (i) in our study the rate constants of AI
for nD states are nearly twice larger than those for nS states, while opposite ratio was
reported in [12], and (ii) our values of k AI fall oﬀ more rapidly with increasing n than
those of [12]. We believe that our measurements are more reliable, since, in contrast to
[12], using equation (22) we did not need to measure the number of Rydberg atoms and
the eﬀective lifetimes, and thus we could avoid the related experimental uncertainties.
The only important parameter, which was not exactly known in the present
experiment, was the density n 3S of ground state atoms in the beam, which was calculated
using the vapor pressure formula of Nesmeyanov [24]. At the same time, care was taken
to ensure that the source temperature and the density of atoms in the beam were
constant during the experiment. Therefore, the relative values of k AI for diﬀerent nS
and nD states are not aﬀected by this uncertainty.

Another interesting observation can be made by comparing our data of ﬁgure 9(b)
with the n dependence for nP states of ﬁgure 1. Such comparison is given in ﬁgure 10.

One can see that both data sets have similar absolute values and similar dependences on
the eﬀective quantum number n ef f . Note, however, that the data reported for nP states
in [12] consist actually of the AI rate constants for the states with 5≤n≤15, which were
measured in [9] under quite diﬀerent conditions of a crossed beam experiment, and the
rate constants for n > 15, which were actually measured in a single beam experiment
[12]. Joining of the two data sets was used in [12] for scaling their relative cross section
values for n > 15.

6. Discussion

Our measurements of associative ionization rate constants were based on use of
equation (22). The accuracy of the measured k AI values depends on the accuracy
with which the values of parameters R, α, W tot
BBR, and n 3S are known. The ratio R
of Na+
2 and Na+ ions was measured directly and was found to be independent of laser
intensities, detunings, and eﬀective lifetimes. The measured n dependences of ﬁgure 7
were reproduced in several experiments, which allow us to be conﬁdent that the values
of R are determined correctly. However, with increasing n the ﬂuctuations of R became
important, because equation (22) uses a product of (R-α), which decreases for high
n to values close to 0, and W tot
BBR, which rapidly grows with increasing n. Therefore
the reported values of k AI can be considered as reliable for lower n≤16, whereas for
higher n the error of determination of k AI is relatively large. More reliable data for
higher n could be obtained by increasing the density of atoms in the beam by an order
of magnitude or more. Unfortunately such increase inevitably leads to complications
in the analysis due to additional phenomena, like radiation trapping, which was found
to strongly aﬀect the velocity distributions of excited atoms in a beam experiment at

Figure 10. Comparison of the experimental associative ionization rate constants
for nS (open circles) and nD (open squares) states obtained in the present study
(ﬁgure 9(b)) with the experimental rate constants for nP states (solid circles) obtained
in [9] and [12] (ﬁgure 1).

densities of 2×1011 cm−3 [37].

Another possible source of errors in the determination of k AI is the choice of values
of the total BBR induced ionization rate W tot
BBR. Figure 6 shows a good agreement of
experimental and theoretical values for all nD states, while for higher nS states the
agreement is rather poor. Therefore, one must choose whether the theoretical or the
experimental values of BBR ionization rates, given by the last two columns of Table 1,
will be used in equation (22). Since the experimental results of ﬁgure 6 were reproduced
in many experiments, we believe that the experimental values W exp
BBR are more reliable.
Therefore, ﬁgure 9(a) should be considered as the ﬁnal result of the k AI measurements.
The absolute values of k AI depend also on the absolute value of n 3S calculated
using the Nesmeyanov’s formula [24]. Numerous studies involving alkali atoms have
conﬁrmed its accuracy in predicting the vapor pressures of alkali gases (see, e.g., the
argumentation in [38]) within a few tens of per cent. Note, that the relative values of
k AI were not aﬀected by the absolute value of n 3S, since it was kept constant during
the experiment. We conclude that on average our absolute values of k AI are accurate to
within better than 50%, while the relative values of k AI are accurate to within (10-20)%.
However, due to the speciﬁc n dependence of the term (R − α) in equation (22), the
reliability of k AI values is better for lower n.

In conclusion, we have measured, for the ﬁrst time, AI rate constants for sodium
nS and nD states in the range of 8≤n≤20.
In this study, we have implemented a
novel method, in which the absolute values of rate constants were determined from the
measurements of relative ratios of the molecular and atomic ion signals, with atomic

ions being from the BBR ionization of Rydberg atoms. The main advantage of this
approach is that the measurements of absolute populations and eﬀective lifetimes, which
are associated with large experimental uncertainties, can be avoided.

To implement this method, we have measured BBR ionization rates for nS and nD
states of sodium with n = 8-20. Comparison of these data with the theory showed a good
agreement for nD states, and disagreement for nS states with n > 15. This discrepancy
cannot be attributed to any of the experimental uncertainties, and the theory must
substantially revise the calculations for nS states.

The comparison of our experimental data on AI rates with other experiments for
nS and nD states is hampered by lacking overlap of the studied ranges of n. However,
for the high n range, where some overlap with the data of [12] exists, notable diﬀerences
were observed. This may be explained by the way we accounted for the background
Na+ ions. These ions were created due to ionization during the extraction electric ﬁeld
pulse, and they arrived to the detector simultaneously with Na+
2 . Such possibility was
not considered in earlier studies [9, 10, 11, 12], and it is not possible to reconstruct
whether such background was present in these experiments.

Curiously, our results for nS and nD states are in a good agreement with the data
of [9] for nP states, though that experiment was performed with two crossed atomic

collisions between ground-state and Rydberg atoms. Accordingly, the collision energies
are about three times lower than those in the crossed-beam experiment, which used
beam sources of the same temperature. In the second part of our article [39] we provide
a detailed comparison of the existing experimental data on associative ionization rate
constants with the theoretical calculations for various relative velocity distributions. The
calculations are based on the stochastic ionization model [4, 8, 5, 6, 7], and they take
into account all possible collisional, spontaneous, and BBR-induced mixing processes.

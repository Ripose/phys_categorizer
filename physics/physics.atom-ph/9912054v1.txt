A temporal evolution of atomic wave packet interacting
with object and reference electromagnetic waves is investi-
gated beyond the linear respond. Under this condition the
diﬀraction of ultracold atomic beam on inhomogeneous laser
radiation is interpreted as beam’s passing through a three-
dimensional hologram, which thickness is proportional to the
interaction time. It is shown that diﬀraction eﬃciency of such
a hologram may reach 100% and is determined by the time
domain.

I. INTRODUCTION

The achievements of the last decade in the ﬁeld of laser
light cooling below the recoil limit [1,2] have opened a
new chapter of atom optics which objective is to ma-
nipulate atomic beams in a way similar to conventional
optics by exploiting the wave properties of the particles.
Indeed, if momenta of cooled atoms verge to the photon
ones, diﬀraction eﬀects may manifest themselves espe-
cially strongly during atomic interaction with space in-
homogeneous radiation. For the corresponding part of
the de Broglie wave spectrum, this provides a possibil-
ity of supplementing the traditional atom optics set of
elements such as mirrors [3], diﬀraction gratings [4,5] or
lenses [6] with holograms of diﬀerent objects, the conven-
tional optics analogues of which have been well known for
several decades [7]. The destination of such atomic holo-
grams is to create matter waves with intended amplitude
and phase characteristics. Since these characteristics are
the same as for the object wave one obtains a strong
and convenient implement for holographic imaging with
atoms. The latter may have useful practical applications
from atom lithography [8] to the manufacturing of mi-
crostructures, or quantum microfabrication.

One of possibilities to make atomic hologram consists
in creation a mechanical mask with appropriate trans-
parency for the incident atomic beam (analogue of two-
dimensional optical hologram). Such a hologram has the
advantage of being permanent, however, up to now only
the masks with binary transparency have been prepared.
So in the experiment [9] the mask was written onto a
thin silicon nitride membrane and allowed for complete
or vanishing transmission of the beam at a given point.
Evidently this reduces resolution in the reconstructed im-
age, because correct holographic storage of information
requires the gradually varying transmission of the beam.

Very interesting proposal has recently been reported in
the work [10], where the authors suggest to use a Bose-
Einstein condensate (BEC) as a registration media for
atomic hologram.
It illustrates the wide potential ap-
plicability of condensates which after having been real-
ized experimentally [11] are available almost routinely in
several laboratories. In this method desired information
is encoded into the condensate in the form of density
modulations by using object and reference laser beams
that form writing optical potential. The reconstruction
of matter wave arises due to s-wave scattering of the
reading-beam atoms on condensate inhomogeneities.

In the previous paper [12] we have shown that atomic
hologram may also be constructed (at certain conditions)
as a superposition of reference and object electromag-
netic waves to be common for optical holography. The
creation of intended matter wave arises when ultracold
atomic beam is diﬀracted from this hologram which in a
fact represents itself the inhomogeneous light ﬁeld. Main
advantages of the proposed scheme are it’s simplicity be-
cause of skipping the recording process and, as a con-
sequence, absence of aberrations in the stored informa-
tion.
In some sense our approach is close to the non-
holographic scheme of wave front engineering [13], which
implies to arbitrarily shape the center-of-mass wave func-
tion of an atom by means of a sequence of suitably shaped
laser pulses, because both methods are based only on
atom-laser interactions.

Main assumption being employed in our holographic
scheme is the linear respond of atomic system on the
laser-ﬁeld inhomogeneity. It requires, in particular, the
weak perturbation of the incident atomic beam and sets
an upper limit on the object wave amplitude (see Eq. (50)
in the Ref. [12]). As a result only a little part of atoms in
the beam can be transferred into the reconstructed mat-
ter wave. Linear respond operation decreases the diﬀrac-
tion eﬃciency of an atomic hologram, i.e. the ratio of
the intensity of diﬀracted atomic waves to the intensity
of reading beam, what may be crucial for practical ap-
plications. In conventional optical holography such a sit-
uation corresponds to the kinematical regime of writing
information [7]. On the other hand, the coupled wave
theory of Kogelnik [14] and the theories based on dy-
namical approximation [15–17], give one a recipe how to
create a hologram with high (up to 100%) diﬀraction eﬃ-
ciency. In this purpose it is necessary to control, besides
others, such a parameter as the thickness of the holo-
gram. Unfortunately the thickness control is diﬃcult to
perform in the scheme of atom holography without regis-
tration medium like our one (see Figure 1 for details). So

1

the purpose of present paper is to suggest a new approach
for creation of atom optics holograms which will inherit
the advantages of our previous scheme and also allow
high diﬀraction eﬃciencies. We will show that desired
approach can be realized if one restricts the existence of
atomic hologram rather in a time than space domain, so
that the hologram will work in a pulsed regime pump-
ing atoms from the beam or initial wave packet into the
reconstructed wave. Note that suggested regime is well
compatible with the Raman cooling methods [2] (includ-
ing laser cooling below the gravitational limit [18]) and
the recent realization of an atom laser [23], which in a
fact repeatedly reproduce coherent or almost coherent
atomic wave packets necessary for actual implementation
of a reading beam.

FIG. 1. Typical for atomic holography layout design of

laser beams and matter wave packets.

Another important prerequisite for successful wave-
front reconstruction with massive particles concerns the
compensation for potentially detrimental
inﬂuence of
gravitational eﬀects. Fortunately, the bulk of atoms has
the magnetic moment, and all one has to do is use the
Stern-Gerlach eﬀect. Superimposing the weakly inhomo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld onto the path of prepolarized par-
ticles and appropriately adjusting the ﬁeld gradient, it is
possible to suspend the ground state atoms everywhere

2

except the region of interaction with radiation. But if
the laser frequency is far from all atom transitions, the
contribution to the total force induced by spatially de-
pendent shifts of the Zeeman levels is negligible. Under
this condition, atoms move like free particles being af-
fected only by the electromagnetic waves.

In Sec. II we derive a system of equations which de-
scribe interaction of atomic wave packet with object and
reference electromagnetic waves when the gravity is com-
pensated. Approximate solution of this system is found
not assuming weak perturbation of initial state, and do-
main of its validity is determined. For reasonable exper-
imental conditions the solution admits an atom-optics
interpretation that is done in Sec. III. Namely, the in-
homogeneous laser radiation is shown to behave like a
three-dimensional hologram in respect to the impinging
wave packets. A numerical simulation of such a holo-
gram created with 31-mode object beam is presented,
and high diﬀraction eﬃciency is demonstrated. Section
IV concludes with a summary of the obtained results.
Most cumbersome expressions are placed into Appendix.

II. BASIC FORMULAS

A. Compensation for the gravity

Consider for deﬁniteness an atom with a J = 1

2 to
J = 3
2 transition, e.g., sodium or cesium. The magnetic
ﬁeld B(r) applied to compensate for the gravity is sup-
posed to contain a homogeneous component B0 directed
g. The remain-
along the gravity acceleration B0 ↑↑

should be small compared to this component

As we will see below, to fulﬁl this condition it is neces-
sary to take B0 in the range 103
104 G. In practice
such a ﬁeld is strong enough to induce Zeeman shifts
which considerably exceed the hyperﬁne splitting inter-
vals
¯hωHFS (but not the multiplet ones). Therefore
may be well
an internal atomic eigenstate
described using the set of quantum numbers consisting
of the angular momenta of electronic shell J and nucleus
I, and their local projections MJ , mI , on the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding energy eigenvalue
is determined not only by the multiplet level EJ but also
by the magnetic ﬁeld B(r) =
and therefore is spa-
tially dependent

cause of condition (2.1) such a spatial dependence, how-
ever, mainly arises from the longitudinal (Bk

nent of the vector B1(r), provided that the components

M gL induced by the force fe appears

as a two-level system with respect to the processes with

Each laser beam is considered as a discrete superposi-
tion of plane monochromatic electromagnetic waves. In
particular, we use the following decomposition of the elec-
tric ﬁeld in the object beam

moves inside a superposition of reference and object laser
beams during all the interaction time, and the expression
(2.5) must well describe the real laser ﬁeld only in the
atom-laser interaction region. Evidently, the latter re-
quirement can always be satisﬁed by decreasing the min-
imal angle between the mode wave vectors. In this case
we can also regard the reference beam as a single mode

Since the atomic dipole momentum operator ˆd is di-
agonal in quantum numbers I and mI , the transitions
which change mI are allowed only due to hyperﬁne inter-
action. As a consequence, the excited state
decays to

ble to deal with an atom as a two-level system even if
spontaneous photon emission takes place. However, to
simplify the consideration the coherent scattering pro-
cesses are assumed to dominate the spontaneous emis-
sion,
γ is kept [20,21], where

For ultracold atomic sample one can further discard
the kinetic energy terms in denominators of the expres-
sion (2.10). As a result the motion of the ground-state

So we bring the Eq. (2.11) to the system of equations

obvious after making a self-consistent assumption about
momentum spectrum of ψm(p, t), m
0, the validity
of which was veriﬁed for two-mode case in Ref. [18].

C. Evolution of wave packets

It is known from the theory of thick optical holograms
that reconstruction of the original (conjugate) object
wave arises only if the reading beam is directed along
(opposite) the reference wave and has the same wave-
length. Relying on analogy with conventional optics let
us consider for deﬁniteness the evolution of atomic wave

In such circumstances diﬀerent parts of this term give
incoherent contributions, which appear to be small at
low gm and can be taken into account within the theory
of perturbation. In zero-order approximation one omits
χ(p, t) so that the system (2.18), (2.20) becomes homo-
morphic with the rate equations describing a (m+1)-level
atom. Note, the stationary solutions of this truncated
system exactly coincide with eigenmodes of correspond-
ing optical hologram [16].

(2.37), (2.40) consists in the requirement to use more del-
icate mechanism (lower laser intensity) in order to restore
more detailed information. They have a counterpart in
the theory of optical holograms [see e.g., Eq. (4) in the
Ref. [16]] which, in turn, is responsible for low intensity
of noise in reconstructed wave.

In a more realistic case we may expect the initial
atomic state to be a statistical mixture well described
with the density matrix

ρgg(p1, p2, 0) =

dp′f (p′)g(p1; p′)g∗(p2; p′),

(3.9)

where f (p) denotes a momentum distribution function.
If this function is compatible with the condition (2.38),
one can readily obtain an expression for ρgg(p1, p2, t) at
, after rewriting into coordinate
any time. In the region
representation it takes the form

ρgg(r1, r2, τ, t) =

Since As(p, τ ) is a sharp-shape function having a nar-
row width δp(τ ) along the vector ∆k [see Eq. (2.34)], the
integral in Eq. (3.10) is limited in this direction. Let
us assume that integration in transversal directions is
also restricted within a little domain

to ﬁnite spectral width of f (p). Then on analyzing Eq.

So, we see that the superposition of laser beams selec-
tively acts only on those wave packets in initial represen-
tation of the atomic density matrix Eq. (3.9), whose spec-
tra are concentrated near the vector ¯hk0, and restores
a pure state (3.11) in such a way. Therefore the inho-
mogeneous laser radiation proves to behave like a three-
dimensional hologram in respect to the incident atomic
beam (impinging wave packets).

One can further establish a close relation between an
atomic hologram, created in a time domain τ and a
permanent optical hologram with the thickness dτ =
¯hk0τ /M along direction of the reading beam.
Indeed,
as is known from optics, the passage of reading beam
through a three-dimensional hologram can be interpreted
as multiple diﬀraction in which small waves, diﬀracted
from diﬀerent registration-media layers with equivalent
transmission of light, interfere constructively to form a
high intensity of reconstructed wave. The same approach
can be used to describe an atom optics hologram being
a light structure, inducing an optical potential through
the atom-laser dipole interaction [12]. Here the role of
equivalent-transmission layers in the media is performed
by the equipotential surfaces. Since dτ is just the dis-
tance the impinging wave packet covers during time τ ,
the numbers of crossed interfaces (layers or surfaces) are
equal for atomic and conventional hologram. Therefore
if there were no evident diﬀerence in initial and bound-
ary conditions, the processes of wave front reconstruction
would be identical in both cases.

It makes possible to classify atomic holograms as thin
or thick diﬀractive optical elements, and use the Talbot
length LTalbot, i.e. the typical interval between consecu-
tive interfaces, as a characteristic scale to distinguish be-
tween the two classes [17]. Namely the hologram can be
considered as thick (three-dimensional) if dτ > LTalbot,
or in terms of time

τ > LTalbotM/(¯hk0).

(3.14)

For most of holographic setups (for instance, like that in
2π/k0, therefore the criterion (3.14)
the Fig. 2) LTalbot ∼
persists in the time domain τ large than the period of
atomic oscillations. Obviously the latter requirement is
well satisﬁed for τ
τ1, the time of π pulse, provided gΣ
is chosen in agreement with the condition (2.37).

not hold at chosen laser light parameters the size of re-
constructed line appears to be
4 times wider than one
might expect from coherent reading beam. Nevertheless,
such image broadening is not too substantial, so that the
atomic hologram can be used even in this unfavorable

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied a method of driving
the ultracold atom propagation using eﬀective holograms
made of laser radiation in speciﬁed time domain. We
have shown that scattered atomic wave packet may in-
herit the features of object electromagnetic wave pro-
vided the atomic internal ground state possesses a trans-
lation invariance due to compensation of gravity with the
Stern-Gerlach eﬀect. We have established a close relation
between atomic hologram created in time domain and
thick optical hologram prepared in corresponding spatial
region and have found a recipe how to control diﬀraction
eﬃciency of such atomic hologram by means of varying
the time domain. Beside adjustment of atom-laser inter-
action time a way to enhance diﬀraction eﬃciency has
proved to consist of cooling the atomic beam so that all
particles would get the same momentum as the momen-
tum of photons in the reference wave. An extraordinary
role here may be played by BEC and coherent atomic-
beam generators, which are under development now [23].
The consideration has been performed for dilute
atomic sample, i.e. we have not included any many-atom

11

interactions [24], which may lead to nonlinear atom op-
tics eﬀects [25] along with raising of the background. The
criteria to neglect these interactions were elaborated in
our previous paper [12] using mean-ﬁeld approximation
applied to the Maxwell-Bloch equations [26] and are well
satisﬁed when the mean-ﬁeld interaction energy per par-
ticle is much less than the typical kinetic energy of an
atom. We have also neglected such possible sources of the
background as spontaneous emission of photons and ﬂuc-
tuations of the laser frequency. While the ﬁrst of these
sources may be eliminated by keeping the laser detun-
ing much bigger than the spontaneous emission rate, the
second one is determined by the spectral width of two-
time electromagnetic-ﬁeld correlation functions [12,27]
and substantially decreases if all ﬁeld modes originate
from one initial laser mode.

Although our scheme of atomic hologram has been de-
veloped for co-directed reading and reference beams it
can readily be modiﬁed for the experimental setup with
opposite propagation of the beams. On full analogy with
the conventional optics such a hologram will reconstruct
the conjugate object wave.

So we see that atom optics holograms appear to be
a useful implement for solving some of the basic tech-
nological problems in the ﬁeld of atom lithography. For
instance, it will be possible to grow 3D circuitry compo-
nents depositing an arbitrary multilayer picture of impu-
rity atoms on a silicon substrate.

APPENDIX: GROUND-STATE GREEN
FUNCTION

Here we present the ﬁrst-order approximation to the
ground-state component of the Green function determin-
ing time evolution of the atomic density matrix according
to the formula (2.7):

Ggg(p, p′, t) = e(t)

G(σ)(p, p′, t),

(A1)

Xσ∈{r,s,b}

where common phase multiplier e(t) = exp[iωt
−
(i/¯h)E|ei(0)t] recovers the solution (2.26) from its slow
time dependence, and

G(r)(p, p′, t) =

We study the dynamics of cold atoms subjected to pairs of closely time-spaced δ-kicks from
standing waves of light. The classical phase space of this system is partitioned into momentum cells
separated by trapping regions. In a certain range of parameters it is shown that the classical motion
is well described by a process of anomalous diﬀusion. We investigate in detail the impact of the
underlying classical anomalous diﬀusion on the quantum dynamics with special emphasis on the
phenomenon of dynamical localization. Based on the study of the quantum density of probability,
its second moment and the return probability we identify a region of weak dynamical localization
where the quantum diﬀusion is still anomalous but the diﬀusion rate is slower than in the classical
case. Moreover we examine how other relevant time scales such as the quantum-classical breaking
time or the one related to the beginning of full dynamical localization are modiﬁed by the classical
anomalous diﬀusion. Finally we discuss the relevance of our results for the understanding of the
role of classical cantori in quantum mechanics.

INTRODUCTION

The eﬀect of the underlying classical dynamics on the
quantum motion has been a recurrent topic of research
In recent
since the early days of the quantum theory.
years the use of experimental techniques based on ultra-
cold atoms in optical lattices [1] has permitted to study
in great detail the role of classical mechanics in simple
quantum systems. In these experiments a very dilute al-
most free gas of atoms (Cs and Rb) is cooled down to
temperatures of the order of tens µK and then interacts
with an optical lattice.
In its simplest form, the opti-
cal lattice consists of two laser beams prepared in such a
way that the resulting interference pattern is a stationary
plane wave in space. The laser frequency is tuned close
to a resonance of the atomic system in order to enhance
the atom-laser coupling but not too close to avoid spon-

can be considered as a point particle in a sine potential,
namely, the quantum pendulum.
If the laser is turned
on and oﬀ in a series of short periodic pulses, the result-
ing system is very well approximated by the so called
quantum kicked rotor (QKR) (see Ref. [2] for a review)
extensively studied in the context of quantum chaos,

δ(t − T n).

(1.1)

For short time scales, quantum and classical motion
agrees. However quantum diﬀusion is eventually sup-
pressed due to destructive interference that localize
eigenstates in momentum space. This counter-intuitive
feature, usually referred to as dynamical localization [3],
was fully understood [4] after mapping the kicked rotor
problem onto a short range one dimensional disordered

system where localization is well established. The theo-
retical predictions of Ref. [4] were eventually conﬁrmed
experimentally [1] (see also Ref.
[5]) by using the cold
atoms techniques mentioned previously. The standard
kicked rotor is thus an ideal candidate for the study of the
quantum properties of one dimensional systems whose
classical motion is diﬀusive. A natural question to ask is
whether this analysis can be extended to other types of
(anomalous) diﬀusive motion.

For values of the kick strength K in Eq.(1.1) suﬃ-
ciently small, the classical phase space is composed of
chaotic and integrable parts and, for certain initial condi-
tions, the classical motion is well described by a process
of anomalous diﬀusion. The quantum transport prop-
erties in systems with a mixed phase space [6] depend
strongly on the details of the Hamiltonian [7]. Even for
a given conﬁguration many types of anomalous diﬀusion
are observed depending on the initial conditions or the
time scales studied [8]. This lack of universality makes
it diﬃcult to precisely assess the eﬀect of the underlying
classical anomalous diﬀusion on the quantum dynamics.

The situation is diﬀerent if the smooth sinusoidal op-
tical potential is replaced by a potential with a loga-
rithmic or power-law singularity [9]. The classical phase
space is homogeneous but still the classical motion is su-

of interference eﬀects, the particle still diﬀuses but at a
slower rate. In fact, for certain types of singularities, full
dynamical localization never occurs and diﬀusion per-
sists at all times. In other cases exponential localization
is eventually observed but anomalous diﬀusion diﬀerent
from the classical one is still observed for shorter times.
The classical density of probability P (p, t) in this region
is accurately described by the solution of an anomalous

Fokker-Planck equation [10]. We note that, unlike the
case of normal diﬀusion, the information obtained from
the knowledge of a few moments of the density of proba-
bility may not be suﬃcient to fully characterize the clas-
sical motion [10]. Thus for a correct understanding of
these systems it is essential a detailed investigation of
P (p, t).

The models studied in Ref. [9] are non-KAM but clas-
sical anomalous diﬀusion can also exist in KAM systems.
One example is the kicked rotor with a smooth potential
but subjected to pairs of closely time-spaced kicks: the
2δ-kicked rotor (2δ-KR) [11, 12].

The dynamics of this model in a certain region of pa-
rameters has already been investigated in the literature:
theoretically in Ref. [11] and experimentally in Ref. [12].
Unlike the single kicked rotor the classical dynamics is
strongly correlated. The momentum space is divided into
regions of fast momentum diﬀusion separated by porous
boundaries, ie narrow trapping regions where classical
trajectories ‘stick’ for relatively long periods. The 2δ-
KR trajectory spends considerable time trapped in a cell
before escaping to the next.

In this paper we provide a detailed account of the type
of classical and quantum anomalous diﬀusion associated
with this motion. We shall restrict ourselves to the one
cell region, namely, to time/momentum scales such that
a particle initially trapped manages to escape and even-
tually reaches a new trapping region. We aim a bet-
ter understanding of how generic features of the classical
anomalous diﬀusion aﬀect the quantum motion in a KAM
system. We restrict ourselves to a region of parameters
such that the dynamics is generic, namely, the classical
phase space is fully chaotic with no island of stability.
However the trapping-leaking mechanism of our model
still causes strong deviations from the single kicked rotor
results. Other important motivation to study the mo-
tion of a fully chaotic 2δ-KR is that it mimics the eﬀect
of cantori in chaotic systems. Thus a particle typically
gets trapped in a cantorus for a long time until it escapes
to the chaotic sea. We argue the ﬁndings of this paper
shed light about the role of classical cantori in quantum
mechanics [13, 15].

The organization of the paper is as follows: in the next
section we introduce the model, review some of its more
relevant dynamical features and discuss the region of pa-
rameters to be studied. In section III, we study the classi-
cal and quantum transport properties. Among others we
analyze the classical and quantum density of probability,
the classical-quantum breaking time and the return prob-
ability. We aim to describe how dynamical localization
arises in systems whose classical diﬀusion is anomalous
and how other relevant scales of the problem such as the
quantum-classical breaking time are aﬀected by the un-
derlying classical dynamics.

In summary, our main new results are: 1) In the re-
gion of interest both classical and quantum dynamics is
well characterized by a process of anomalous diﬀusion.
2) We identify two routes to dynamical localization as

2

a function of ~:
for ~ > ~c (~c is function of the kick
strength and the separation between pairs of kicks) stan-
dard dynamical localization occurs in the trapping region
and the particle does not escape; for ~ < ~c the cen-
tral part probability density is exponential and almost
time independent. However diﬀusion does not stop since
eventually the particle escapes from the trapping region.
True dynamical localization in this case occurs for time
scales much longer than the typical time to escape from
the trapping region. For intermediate times we ﬁnd the
quantum diﬀusion is anomalous but slower than the clas-
sical one. 3) The classical anomalous diﬀusion induces a
fractional scaling with ~ in diﬀerent quantities of interest
such as the quantum-classical breaking time. 4) The 2δ-
KR can be used as a simpliﬁed model to study the eﬀect
of cantori in classical and quantum mechanics.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a system with a Hamiltonian correspond-

ing to a sequence of closely spaced pairs of kicks:

H =

p2
2

− K cos x X
n

[δ(t − nT ) + δ(t − nT + ǫ)] ,

where ǫ ≪ T is a short time interval and K is the kick-
strength.

A. Classical dynamics

The classical map for the 2δ-KP is a straightforward

extension of the Standard Map:

pn+1 = pn + K sin xn;
xn+1 = xn + ǫpn+1;

pn+2 = pn+1 + K sin xn+1
xn+2 = xn+1 + τ pn+2

(2.1)

where ǫ is a very short time interval between two kicks
in a pair and τ = T − ǫ is the (much longer) time in-
terval between the pairs. Clearly, the limit ǫ = τ or 0
corresponds to the Standard Map, which describes the
classical dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor:

pi+1 = pi + K sin xi,
xi+1 = xi + pi+1.

(2.2)

Particles with momenta p0 ≃ (2m + 1)π/ǫ and m =
0, ±1, ±2, · · · (relative to the optical lattice) are conﬁned
in momentum trapping regions and absorb little energy;
conversely, particles prepared near p0 ≃ 2mπ/ǫ experi-
ence rapid energy growth up to localization. The ba-
sic mechanism of trapping is fairly intuitive: atoms for
which p0 = (2m + 1)π/ǫ experience an impulse K sin x
followed by another one ≃ K sin(x + π) which in eﬀect
cancels the ﬁrst. Over time, however, there is a gradual
de-phasing of this classical ‘anti-resonant’ process. A the-
oretical study [12] of the classical diﬀusion in this system

angular momenta l and m. However, this is not the case
for the matrix of U ǫ.

Assuming |l − m| is small it was shown in Ref.

[11]

that

U ǫ

lm ≈ e

−iΦ Jl−m [2K~ cos (l~ǫ/2)]

(2.6)

where the phase Φ = (l2T + ǫlm + ǫl2)~/2 + π(l −
m)/2. Hence we infer a momentum dependent band-
width, b(p) = 2K~ cos (pǫ/2).

While U (0) has a constant bandwidth, the bandwidth
for the matrix of U ǫ oscillates with l from a maximum
value bmax = 2K~, equivalent to twice the bandwidth of
U (0), down to a minimum value bmin ∼ 0. U ǫ is thus
partitioned into sub-matrices of dimension N = 2π/~ǫ
corresponding precisely to the momentum cells of width
∆p = N ~ observed in experiments [12].

In this paper we aim to study both the evolution of an
initially given wave-packet and its low order moments.
The structure of the evolution operator U ǫ allows an ef-
ﬁcient and accurate numerical calculation of these quan-
tities. The action of the operator U ǫ on a quantum state
can be decomposed into four steps: two associated with
the kicks, which are diagonal in the space presentation;
and two associated with the free rotations between neigh-
boring kicks, which are diagonal in the momentum pre-
sentation. We thus take the space and momentum rep-
resentations alternatively to facilitate the calculations.
The transformation between the representations is eﬃ-
ciently carried out with the fast Fourier transformation
(FFT) algorithm. In our numerical simulations we can
set the size of the basis up to 220 which is big enough to
guarantee a double precision accuracy.

found anomalous momentum diﬀusion for any p0 and in-
termediate time scales. It was also observed long-ranged
corrections to the uncorrelated diﬀusion rate not present
in the standard kicked rotor. Inside the trapping region
diﬀusion is normal but the coeﬃcient of diﬀusion D has
a dependence on K as D ∼ K 3, similar to the one found
in single kicked rotors in a region of the classical phase
space densely populated by cantori [13]. By contrast, if
the phase space is fully chaotic it is expected D ∼ K 2.
This suggests that our model may reproduce to a good
approximation the eﬀect of cantori in a KAM system.

The size in momentum space of the trapping region
δp strongly depends on the parameters ǫ, K deﬁning the
model.

For an accurate analysis of the trapped region is neces-
sary that: i) the particle is initially trapped, ii) the par-
ticle dwells on average a time long enough in this region
before it escapes from it. In Ref.
[12] it was concluded
that this implies the criterion Kǫ ≪ 1. However, if Kǫ is
too small, the phase space would be too regular. Since we
are interested in generic feature of the motion, we take
iii) τ ≫ 1. This implies less correlations between suc-
cessive space positions of the particle. We thus restrict
ourselves through the paper to the range Kǫ ≪ 1 and
τ ≫ 1 with initial conditions inside the trapping region.

In this section we investigate the classical and quan-
tum dynamics of the 2δ-KR. Our main motivation is to
describe the eﬀect on the quantum motion of generic
dynamical features of the classical dynamics such as
the trapping-escaping mechanism. We mainly focus on
time/momentum scales such that the motion is con-
ﬁned inside one cell. Initial conditions are always chosen
within the trapping region. For a study in the multi-cell
region we refer to Ref. [11, 12].

As was mentioned previously, we restrict ourselves to
the window of parameters Kǫ ≪ 1. In addition it is also
imposed τ ≫ 1 in order to remove correlations that make
the dynamics non generic. In the numerical calculations
τ, K, and ǫ are ﬁxed within the above limits. Our main
conclusions do not depend on the speciﬁc value of the
parameters. Quantum eﬀects are investigated by varying
~.

cal energy diﬀusion (from bottom to top: ~ = 4 × 10−3, 1 ×
10−3, 5 × 10−4, 2.5 × 10−4 and classical respectively) for K =
0.2, ǫ = 0.25 and τ = 104. The two ﬁgures only diﬀer in the
scale of time/momentum represented. Fig.(a) shows the eﬀect
of leaking from the trapping region in longer time scales while
Fig.(b) describes diﬀusion inside the trapping region. The
inset of Fig.(b) shows the dependence of quantum-classical
breaking time tc on ~; the best ﬁtting (thin solid line) sug-
gests that tc ∼ ~−1.39±0.05 for ~ < 10−3. This is in contrast
with the single kicked rotor where tc ∼ ~−2

A. Energy diﬀusion

The classical dynamics in the trapping region was in-
vestigated analytically in Ref. [12]. It was found that en-
ergy diﬀusion hp2(t)i ∼ Dt increases linearly with time.
However, the dependence of D ∼ K 3 on the kicking
strength is diﬀerent from the single kicked rotor predic-
tion D ∼ K 2 in the chaotic region but similar to the one
observed if the classical phase space is populated by can-
tori [14]. This suggests that our model captures generic
features of the eﬀect of cantori in classical mechanics.

Eventually the particle reaches the edge of the trap-
ping region and leaks outside. Diﬀusion becomes then
anomalous until the particle gets trapped again. As is
shown in Fig. 1, the parameters K, ǫ and τ were cho-
sen such that the typical time for considerable leaking
is tleak ≈ 200 ≫ 1. Before this time the leakage is still

4

possible but with a negligible probability. As the parti-
cle approaches the outer boundaries of the two cells that
sandwich the trapping region (at t ≈ 6 × 103), the dif-
fusion begin to slow down. The time unit we take in all
ﬁgures is the number of the kick pairs.

In the quantum case the dynamics is richer. If we re-
strict ourselves to the one cell region three time scales are
distinguished. In a ﬁrst stage, t < tc, the quantum av-
eraged energy agrees with its classical counterpart. As a
result of the peculiarities of the classical dynamics, scal-
ing with ~ of the classical-quantum breaking time tc may
be diﬀerent from tc ∼ ~−2, the result for a single kicked
rotor. For longer times, tc < t < td, interference eﬀects
start to be important. As a consequence we expect the
particle still diﬀuses, hp2(t)i ≈ Dquantγ, but at a rate
which decreases as ~ increases and it is lower than the
classical one; namely γ ≤ 1 and Dquan ≤ Dclas. This is
a novel regime caused by the interplay of destructive in-
terference and classical anomalous diﬀusion. This stage
lasts up to a time td in which full dynamical localization
occurs and diﬀusion is totally arrested.

Our numerical results conﬁrm the above qualitative
picture. Results for quantum and classical energy diﬀu-
sion hp2(t)i (p = ~k for the quantum case) as a function
of time t for τ = 104 and Kǫ = 0.05 ≪ 1 for diﬀerent ~’s
are shown in Fig. 1. In the classical case 2 × 107 initial
conditions uniformly distributed along p0 = π/ǫ (located
at the center of the trapping region) have been utilized
for the ensemble average. The quantum initial condition
is set as the momentum eigenstate |l0i with l0 the integer
closest to p0/~.

We restrict ourselves to time/momentum scales such
that the motion is conﬁned to one cell. We observe that
for short times both classical and quantum results coin-
cide up to a certain breaking time tc which has a frac-
tional scaling with ~, diﬀerent from the single kick rotor
case (see insert of Fig. 1b, where tc is evaluated as the
maximum time such that the deviation between classi-
cal and quantum hp2(t)i is below 20%). For later times
the quantum particle still diﬀuses normally but with a
smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dquan (see Tab. I). This is
a direct consequence of destructive interference eﬀects.
We relate this new region of weak dynamical localiza-
tion to the eﬀect of classical trapping on the quantum
dynamics. This interpretation is reinforced by the ob-
served dependence of Dquan on ~ in the trapping region
(see Tab. I). For ~ suﬃciently small (~ < 10−4), Dquan is
close to the classical prediction. For larger ~ we observe
a growing dependence on ~ though the exponent γ ∼ 1
is not modiﬁed. It decreases as ~ increases. This situa-
tion lasts until a maximum ~, denoted as ~max, such that
the breaking-time tc coincides with the time td in which
full dynamical localization starts. For the parameters
utilized ~max ≈ 6 × 10−3.

We have observed an additional ~ scale, denoted as ~c,
relevant for a precise characterization of the trapping-
leaking mechanism. It is deﬁned by the smallest ~ such
that td < tleak. For the parameters used ~c ≈ 10−3 <

~max. For ~c < ~ < ~max, td < tleak, Dquan is close to
zero, and the wave-packet is well localized in the trapping
region. In this range as ~ approaches ~max, td tends to
tc. For ~ < ~c, the time scale td related to the dynami-
cal localization increases dramatically. However quantum
energy diﬀusion is still linear in time (like the classical
one) up to tleak. After t ≈ tleak the classical particle
starts to leave the trapping region and the classical mo-
tion become superdiﬀusive. The quantum dynamics for
~ < ~c is also superdiﬀusive, but with a smaller leaking
rate. The smaller the ~, the closer the leaking rate to the
classical one. Eventually (t ≈ 6 × 103) a new trapping
region is approached. As a consequence, both classical
and quantum motions are slowed down again.

We note that the region of weak dynamical localiza-
tion characterized by a linear time dependence of the en-
ergy evolution is not present in the standard kicked rotor
where there is no intermediate region between classical
diﬀusion and full quantum dynamical localization. This
is an indication that even though the quantum diﬀusion
is still normal inside the trapping region the 2δ-KR is
essentially diﬀerent from the single kicked rotor.

For longer times t > td diﬀusion stops as a consequence
of standard dynamical localization similar to the one ob-
served in the single quantum kicked rotor. Our results
thus suggest that in order to observe genuine quantum
anomalous diﬀusion the value of ~ must be such that
td ≫ tc. This corresponds with ~ ≤ ~c. We remark that
this condition should be met by any experiment aiming
to conﬁrm the results reported in this paper.

Although not shown, we have conﬁrmed that the de-
pendence of the classical diﬀusion constant is D ∼ K 3
similar to the case of a single kick rotor in a region popu-
lated by classical cantori. This together with the anoma-
lous dependence with ~ also found in studies of the role of
cantori in quantum mechanics [15] is a further indication
that the 2δ−KR in the region of parameters studied in
this paper can be utilized as a eﬀective model to investi-
gate the role of classical cantori in quantum mechanics.

Finally we note that hp2(t)i ∼ t is only a necessary con-
dition for normal diﬀusion but this by no means assures
that the density of probability is Gaussian-like [10]. In-
deed, in the next section we will show that the quantum
and classical density of probability of our model strongly
deviate from the normal diﬀusion prediction.

B. Density of probability

The density of probability of ﬁnding a particle with
momentum p after a time t from a given initial state
|ψ(0)i = |l0i is given by Pq(p, t) ≡ Pq(k, t) = |hk|ψ(t)i|2
with p = k~. The parameter set K = 0.2, ǫ = 0.05 and
τ = 104 chosen permits us to study generic features of
the motion. By generic we mean the trapping region is
large enough to be studied and the classical phase space
has not stability island; namely, Kǫ ≪ 1.
In addition
τ ≫ 1, so consecutive pairs of kicks are uncorrelated. In
all cases our initial state is located in the trapping region.

1. Classical density of probability

The classical P (p, t) is obtained by evolving the classi-
cal equation of motion for 2 × 107 diﬀerent initial condi-
tions at the center of the trapping region. Positions are
uniformly distributed along the interval (−π, π).

P (p, t) is approximated as the set of the states of the
whole ensemble that falls in (p−∆p/2, p+∆p/2) at time t.
In the numerical calculations we set ∆p = 0.02php2(t)i.
We distinguish the following regions in the classical
density of probability (see Fig. 2a): For short times such
that the particle is well inside the trapping region the
diﬀusion is normal and P (p, t) is Gaussian (see inset of
Fig. 2a). As the boundary of the trapping region is
approached we observe a gradual crossover from normal
to anomalous (super) diﬀusion. For small momentum
P (p, t) is still Gaussian as leaking to the outside region
is weak. As time approaches tleak ≈ 200, the typical
time to reach the edge of the trapping region, the cen-
tral (small momentum) Gaussian region becomes smaller
and smaller. Meanwhile, the outskirts bend down and
a power-like behavior typical of anomalous diﬀusion is
observed.

For longer times, t > tleak, P (p, t) ∼ p−α with α a de-
creasing function of time (Fig. 2a). For t → ∞, α → 0.
This behavior is not surprising due to the transient na-
ture of the trapping-leaking mechanism. The power-law
decay is a direct consequence of the enhanced diﬀusion
once the particle has escaped from the trapped region.
However, precisely due to this fast diﬀusion, the particle
soon approaches a new trapped region where diﬀusion is
slowed down again until the particle leaks from the trap.
As a consequence of this bottle neck, the exponent α de-
creases and the density of probability in the region of
fast diﬀusion gradually increases with time. In addition
a sharp jump in P (p, t) is observed between the enhanced

FIG. 2: (Color online) Distribution of the classical (a) and
quantum probability density with ~ ≈ 5 × 10−4 (b) and
3 × 10−3 (c) respectively. Classical P (p, t) is characterized
by a Gaussian proﬁle (inset of Fig.
(a)) before leaking
from the trap occurs (t < tleak ≈ 200). For later times
tleak < t < td, P (p, t) develops power-law tails, P (p, t) ∼ p−α,
typical of anomalous diﬀusion. The exponent α varies in time
(α ≈ 4.5, 2.9, 2.3, 1.3 for t = 500, 1000, 2000 and 6000 respec-

power-law tails as well (see Fig. (b)). The best ﬁtting ex-
ponent, indicated by thin black lines, is α ≈ 7.1, 4.2, 3.0, 0.94
for t = 500, 1000, 2000 and 6000 respectively). For larger ~

diﬀusion zone and the new trapping region (see Fig. 2a
for t = 6000 where a steep drop of P (p, t) happens at
around |p − p0| = 2π/ǫ corresponding to the new trap-
ping region). For long times t → ∞, P (p, t) resembles a
staircase, ﬂat between trapping regions and discontinu-
ous in the trapping areas. This is a simple consequence
of the fact that the dwelling time in the trapping region
is typically much longer than the one needed to travel
between two consecutive traps. We shall see in the next
section that quantum mechanically the situation is dif-
ferent.

The quantum density of probability Pq(p, t) was cal-
culated from an initial condition |ψ(0)i = |l0i with
l0 = π/~ǫ. For given values of ~ and ǫ the right hand
side may not be an integer. Then the nearest value of
~ was chosen to ensure this condition. Thus p0 = π/ǫ
exactly for both classical and quantum calculations. As
in the classical case, Pq(p, t) was evaluated by summing
up the probability of falling in a bin of width ∆p. We set
∆p = 0.0315 for ~ ≈ 5 × 10−4 (Fig. 2b) and ∆p = 0.006
for ~ ≈ 3 × 10−3 (Fig. 2c). Hence it is in fact a coarse-
grained result where part of quantum ﬂuctuations have
been suppressed. It is more instructive to start our anal-
ysis of the quantum probability density with a general
account of the expected eﬀect of the classical motion on
the quantum dynamics. As in the single kicked rotor we
expect to observe dynamical localization for suﬃciently
long times t > td [4]. However the trapping (and even-
tual release) mechanism changes qualitatively the route
to dynamical localization in our model. In fact we distin-
guish two diﬀerent scales for full dynamical localization.
For ~ > ~c, full dynamical localization will occur well
inside the trapping region where the classical diﬀusion is
normal. As a consequence the particle will not have time
to escape, (td ≤ tleak ≈ 200 with our parameters) and the
density of probability will be time independent and will
decay exponentially as a function of the momentum p.
These are typical signatures of exponential localization
similar to the one observed in a single kicked rotor. The
situation is diﬀerent if ~ < ~c is small enough such that
leaking to the enhanced diﬀusion region is possible. In
this case we may still observe typical features of dynam-
ical localization within the trapping region. However for
larger momenta the density of probability develops time-
dependent power law tails typical of anomalous diﬀusion.
Full dynamical localization will not typically take place
until the next trapping region is reached or later if ~ is
small enough. This revival of quantum diﬀusion is a typ-
ical feature of our model that it is not observed in the
single kicked rotor. Below we provide a more detailed ac-
count of the relevant time and momentum scales (see Fig.
2b) for an accurate description of the quantum density
of probability:

1. For t, p well within the trapping region: t < tleak

and |p−p0| < pleak ∼ 0.1. After a narrow region in which
classical and quantum results fully agree (see inset Fig.
2a), we observe in the quantum case a cusp for p ∼ p0
caused by the incipient dynamical localization in the core
of the trapping region. However for larger momentum
the distribution is Gaussian in agreement with previous
results (see Fig. 1) for the energy diﬀusion.

2. For p within the trapping region (|p − p0| < pleak)
but t > tleak. The core of the quantum probability is
still exponentially localized (see Fig. 2c) but the out-
skirts Pq(p, t) ∼ 1/pα develops a power-law tail (see Fig.
In this region the
2b) typical of anomalous diﬀusion.
exponent α depends on ~ but it is time independent.

3. For p outside or close to the edge of the trap-
ping region and t ≥ tleak. The quantum probability
Pq(p, t) ∼ 1/pα develops power-law tails but in this case
the exponent α decreases with time and eventually tends
to zero for t → ∞ (see Fig. 2b). This is in principle
surprising. It is in general expected that destructive in-
terference slows down the quantum motion. As a conse-
quence the quantum density of probability should decay
faster than the classical one. However there is a simple
explanation for this behavior: in a ﬁrst stage, the quan-
tum exponent α is larger than the classical one as a conse-
quence of destructive interference eﬀects. For later times,
the classical probability between two trapping region be-
come smaller than the quantum one since the classical
particle leaks faster into the next cell. At the same time
destructive interference slows down the quantum motion
in this region. Eventually Pq(p, t) saturates, α → 0 be-
fore the next trapping region is reached (see t = 6000 in
Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b).

4. For times suﬃciently long t > td quantum destruc-
tive interference eﬀects dominate, standard dynamical
localization takes place, and diﬀusion stops. Pq(p, t) be-
comes time independent and decays exponentially as a
function of the momentum. As was mentioned previ-
ously the value of td depends dramatically on whether
dynamical localization occurs in the trapping region or
after it has escaped from the trapping region. In the for-
mer case td < tleak ≈ 200 and in the latter td > 104 with
no intermediate values.

C. Return Probability

Having studied diﬀusion in momentum for a ﬁxed time
t we now look at the explicit dependence in time.
In
order to proceed we calculate return probabilities P (t)
of a wave-packet as a function of time. We average over
N initial starting conditions close to the center of the
trapping region to suppress quantum ﬂuctuations,

FIG. 3: (Color online) Return probability as a function of
time for K = 5, ǫ = 0.04 and τ = 104. We present results
for diﬀerent values of ~ together with the classical prediction.
In the trapping region ((t < tleak ≈ 30) in this case) the
return probability decays as a power-law P (t) ∼ t−γ . The
exponent γ, given by the best linear ﬁtting (indicated by a
thin black line), decreases as ~ increases. We have obtained
γ ≈ 0.50, 0.46, 0.40 and 0.28 for the classical and quantum
cases with ~ = 2−7, 2−6 and 2−5 respectively.

0)i = |li. The results were further averaged from l1 ≈
π/~ǫ − N/2 to l2 = l1 + N . In order to ensure the initial
conditions are within the trapping region, the value N is
set to be N ≈ δp/~ with δp the width of the trapping
region.

The return probability provides valuable information
about the degree of localization of a system. Indeed it
was already utilized in the landmark paper by Anderson
[17] about localization. A non zero P (t) in the t → ∞
limit is a signature of exponential localization. On the
other hand P (t) ∝ t−d/2 with d the spatial dimensional-
ity is typical of fully delocalized eigenstates (normal dif-
fusion). In the theory of localization a power-law decay
P (t) ∝ 1/tγ with γ < d/2 is a signature of localization
typical of a disordered conductor close to a localization
transition. Such slow decay has also been related to the
eﬀect of cantori in transport [18] properties.

Our results are summarized in Fig. 3. For the sake
of comparison, we ﬁrst study the classical counterpart of
P (t). Again 2 × 107 initial states uniformly located in
space and with p0 = π/ǫ were evolved. P (t) was eval-
uated as the set of states that fall in the momentum
region |p − p0| < 0.004 at time t. For the parameters
(K = 5, ǫ = 0.04 and τ = 104) chosen for the calculation,
the width of the trapping region δp ≈ 4, and tleak ≈ 30.
For t < tleak, P (t) ∼ t−0.5, in agreement with the Gaus-
sian probability density distribution obtained in the pre-
vious section. For t > tleak, leaking gradually takes over
and after a crossover P (t) undergoes a faster power-law
decay, P (t) ∼ t−1.5 until the next trap is reached.

Within the trapping region the quantum P (t) decays
as t−γ with γ < 0.5, a decreasing function of ~. The fact
that γ < d/2 is a clear indication that destructive inter-

ference is already slowing down the quantum diﬀusion.
Not surprisingly, γ approaches its classical limit, 0.5, as
~ → 0.

For suﬃciently large ~ ≥ 0.1 the particle cannot es-
capes from the trapping region and P (t) becomes con-
stant (see for example P (t) for ~ = 2−3 in Fig. 3). This
is fully consistent with previous results for the energy
diﬀusion and the density of probability.

For smaller ~ the particle escapes from the trapping re-
gion and full dynamical localization occurs only for times
much longer than those shown in Fig. 3. For t > tleak
we observe a rapid decrease of P (t). The decay is still
power-law but the exponent is larger than for t < tleak
though smaller than the classical result (γ ≈ 1.5). This
time scale can be utilized to study the interplay between
quantum eﬀects and classical anomalous diﬀusion. De-
structive interference slows down the quantum motion
however diﬀusion is not arrested due to the underlying
classical anomalous (super)diﬀusion.

Finally we address the similarities of our model with
those of a generic Hamiltonian in a region of the phase
space dominated by cantori. Qualitatively the eﬀect of
the trapping region is similar to that of cantori [8, 13]. In
both cases the particle remains in a small region of the
phase space for a long time until eventually is released
to the chaotic sea.
In addition the dependence of the
classical diﬀusion constant D ∼ K 3 [11] is identical in
both cases.
In the quantum realm cantori [16, 19, 20]
induces slow power-law decay in quantities such as the
return probability [18] or the eigenstates themselves [19].
In addition cantori have been linked to fractional scaling
with ~ [15] and anomalous dynamical localization [21].

8

All these features have also been observed in the model
studied in this paper. These similarities strongly suggest
that the 2 − δ KR can be utilized as a toy model to study
the eﬀect of cantori in classical and quantum mechanics.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the eﬀect of classical anomalous diﬀu-
sion on the quantum dynamics of atoms exposed to pairs
of δ-kicks. Our result are generic, do not depend on the
parameters Kǫ ≪ 1 and τ ≫ 1 utilized. We have iden-
tiﬁed a regime of quantum diﬀusion where the motion
is slow down due to destructive interference but full dy-
namical localization has not occurred yet. This has been
related to the eﬀect of the underlying classical trapping
and releasing mechanism on the quantum dynamics. We
have argued that the 2δ-KR can be used as a simpliﬁed
model to study the eﬀect of cantori in classical and quan-
tum mechanics.

We disuss the transition from a fully deoherent to a (quasi-)ondensate regime in a harmonially

trapped weakly interating 1D Bose gas. By using analyti approahes and verifying them against

exat numerial solutions, we (cid:28)nd a harateristi rossover temperature and rossover atom number

that depend on the interation strength and the trap frequeny. We then identify the onditions

for observing either an interation-indued rossover senario or else a (cid:28)nite-size Bose-Einstein

ondensation phenomenon harateristi of an ideal trapped 1D gas.

One-dimensional (1D) Bose gases are remarkably rih

physial systems exhibiting properties not enountered in

to observe an interation-indued rossover to a quasi-

In this paper, we analyze the properties of the 1D Bose

the onditions that enable the realization of either of

gas in the weakly interating regime, where the dimen-

sionless interation parameter γ = mg/(n~2) is small, n
being the linear density, m the atom mass, and g the

1D oupling onstant. This is opposite to Girardeau's

regime of (cid:16)fermionization(cid:17) [1℄ ahieved in the limit of

these two ompeting senarios.

We start by brie(cid:29)y reviewing the physis of a uniform

1D Bose gas in the thermodynami limit, in the ase of

very weak interations γ

is in the quasi-ondensate (or Gross-Pitaevskii) regime

where the density (cid:29)utuations are suppressed and the gas

is oherent on a distane sale smaller than the phase o-

redued below the ideal gas level of 2 and is lose to 1

For a uniform weakly interating 1D Bose gas, one

has a smooth interation-indued rossover to a quasi-

ondensate whih is a Bose-ondensed state with a (cid:29)u-

tuating phase. This ours when the temperature T
beomes smaller than Td√γ [6, 7, 8, 9℄, where Td =
~2n2/2m is the temperature of quantum degeneray (in
energy units, kB = 1). For a harmonially trapped 1D

gas with weak interations a similar rossover senario

[6, 7, 8, 9℄. In this regime the hemial potential is posi-

tive and well approximated by µ

gn. For T

≃

Td√γ ,

the gas is in the fully deoherent regime:

interations

between the atoms have a small e(cid:27)et on the equation

of state and the loal pair orrelation is lose to that of

an ideal Bose gas [6℄. This regime ontains the quantum

deoherent domain Td√γ

Eq. (6). The deoherent regime is learly seen in graphs

barely satis(cid:28)ed, the features of the quantum deoherent

adopt the ideal gas treatment of Ref.

[10℄. For a (cid:28)xed

better than 10% by the ideal Bose gas approah and dif-

temperature, this treatment predits a (cid:28)nite-size BEC at

a ritial atom number NC = T /(~ω) ln(2T /~ω).

It is

lear that the (cid:28)nite-size BEC phenomenon will prevail

the interation-indued rossover senario if NC < Nco .
In fat, the opposite inequality, NC > Nco , is equiva-

lent to that of Eq. (8), whih makes our analysis self-

onsistent and implies that the ondition of validity of

the LDA, ω

ωco , serves as the simultaneous riterion

≪

for observing the interation-indued rossover, while

the opposite ondition orresponds to (cid:28)nite-size onden-

sation. At a onstant N , the riterion for observing

the interation-indued rossover an be obtained from

Eq. (8) by replaing T with N ~ω/ ln(2N ). The opposite

riterion leading to the (cid:28)nite-size BEC has been previ-

ously found in Ref. [12℄ from the ondition gn0 ≪

~ω .

In the following, we analyze the properties of the

interation-indued rossover, sub jet to inequality (8).

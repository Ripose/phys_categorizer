Abstract

We discuss the properties of Rydberg atoms in a magnetic Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap being commonly

used in ultracold atomic physics experiments. The Hamiltonian is derived and it is demonstrated

how tight traps alter the coupling of the atom to the magnetic ﬁeld. We solve the underlying

Schr¨odinger equation of the system within a given n-manifold and show that for a suﬃciently

large Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength the 2n2-dimensional system of coupled Schr¨odinger equations decays into

several decoupled multicomponent equations governing the center of mass motion. An analysis of

the fully quantized center of mass and electronic states is undertaken. In particular, we discuss the

situation of tight center of mass conﬁnement outlining the procedure to generate a low-dimensional

ultracold Rydberg gas.

Rydberg atoms possess remarkable properties. Although being electronically highly ex-

cited they can possess lifetimes of the order of milliseconds. Moreover, due to the large

displacement of the valence electron and the atomic core they are highly susceptible to elec-

tric ﬁelds and therefore easily polarizable. The latter is impressively shown in ultracold

Rydberg gases [1] where the mutual multipole interaction of two Rydberg atoms leads to

a number of intriguing many body eﬀects, such as resonant F¨orster transitions [2] and the

dipole blockade mechanism [3, 4]. Their tunable electric dipole moment makes them also

interesting candidates for the realization of a two-qubit quantum gate [5] which is a crucial

ingredient for the realization of quantum information processing schemes. However, a pre-

requisite for realizing the latter in a coherent fashion is the availability of a well-controlled

environment in which the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction takes place: Firstly one has to assure

the Rydberg atoms to be individually addressable. Secondly, since the mutual interaction

strength strongly depends on their relative displacement, a suitable way to spatially arrange

the atoms has to be found.

There exist several proposals for building traps for Rydberg atoms suggesting the use

of electric [6], optical [7] and magnetic ﬁelds [8]. The experimental feasibility of magnetic

trapping has been shown recently by employing very strong magnetic ﬁelds [9]. Trapping in

the quantum regime, which is indispensable to gain precise control over the atomic motion,

however, could not yet be demonstrated. Properties of such quantized Rydberg states that

emerge in a magnetic quadrupole trap have been theoretically discussed in Refs. [8]. The

authors report on a strong conﬁnement of the atomic center of mass (c.m.) with trapping

frequencies of the order of 10 kHz. At the same time the electronic structure is, to a large

extent, unchanged compared to the ﬁeld-free case. Although the 3D magnetic quadrupole

ﬁeld is omnipresent in ultracold atom experiments it has one drawback. Due to the point of

zero ﬁeld strength at its center Majorana transitions are likely to happen thereby leading to

loss from the trap. In Ref. [8] it was shown that by increasing the total angular momentum

of the atom this problem can be overcome. However, for practical purposes it is desirable

to have trapping at small or even zero center of mass angular momentum since this is the

regime in which trapped ground state atoms are usually prepared.

In this letter we show that trapped and controllable Rydberg states can be achieved in a

Ioﬀe-Pritchard (IP) trap. We discuss how the large size of the Rydberg atom modiﬁes the

coupling to the magnetic ﬁeld in comparison to ground state atoms and demonstrate the

2

feasibility of generating low dimensional Rydberg gases. Using the IP conﬁguration is of

particular relevance since it is usually employed for preparing ultracold atomic gases which

can serve as the initial state for the production of trapped ultracold Rydberg atoms.

In the two-body picture the mutual interaction of the valence electron (particle 1) and

the remaining core (particle 2) of the Rydberg atom can be modeled by an eﬀective potential

that exhibits short range properties describing the electron-core scattering and a long range

Coulombic behaviour. States with large electronic angular momenta l, which represent

the focus of the present investigation, probe almost exclusively the Coulombic tail of this

potential. We do not account for relativistic eﬀects such as spin-orbit coupling which for

large n, l are negligibly small compared to the energy shift due to the magnetic ﬁeld of the

IP trap [8, 10]. The interaction of the electronic and core charge with the magnetic ﬁeld are

taken into account via the minimal coupling. Following the above arguments and including

the coupling of the nuclear and electronic magnetic moments to the external ﬁeld our initial

Hamiltonian reads

Next let us insert these expressions into the Hamiltonian (1) and introduce relative r and

c.m. coordinates R with their respective momenta p and P. In the absence of the external

ﬁeld one arrives at a decoupled c.m. and electronic motion. However, already in the presence

of a homogeneous ﬁeld this is not the case [11] and consequently terms coupling the c.m. and

internal motion emerge. To simplify the latter in case of our inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld

conﬁguration we apply the unitary transformation U = exp

The Hamiltonian (3) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁrst two terms describe the

G(X, Y ). One encounters

·

a similar coupling term also for ’point-like’ ground state atoms [13] where, however, the

generically strong hyperﬁne coupling leads to the fact that µ is proportional to the total

spin F. The distinct feature of the Hamiltonian (3) is the appearance of the last term

which accounts for the ﬁnite size of the Rydberg atom. This term scales according to

if the size of the

atom and the size of the c.m. state become comparable. In a typical macroscopic IP trap [9]

the c.m. wave functions are very extended and the energy spacing between the c.m. states

is small. Hence, in this ’classical’ regime

r has little eﬀect and can be neglected. The

H

situation changes for tighter IP traps which can, for example, be realized by so-called atom

chips [15]. Here the micro structured wires allow for the generation of traps for which the

size of the c.m. ground states are of the order of several 100 nm and become therefore

comparable to the typical size of Rydberg atoms.

In order to solve the Schr¨odinger equation belonging to the Hamiltonian (3) we employ

an adiabatic separation of the electronic and the c.m. motion. To this end a unitary trans-

formation U(X, Y ) which diagonalizes the last two (matrix) terms of the Hamiltonian, i.e.

r)U(X, Y ) = Eα(X, Y ), is applied. Since U(X, Y ) depends

on the c.m. coordinates the transformed kinetic term involves non-adiabatic (oﬀ-diagonal)

coupling terms which we will neglect in the following. We are thereby lead to a set of 2n2

decoupled diﬀerential equations governing the adiabatic c.m. motion within the individual

two-dimensional energy surfaces Eα, i.e. the surfaces Eα serve as potentials for the c.m. of

the atom. Figure 1 shows an intersection through a subset of these surfaces for the case of

87Rb in a IP trap with a gradient G = 20 T/m and a Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength B = 0.01 G. One

immediately notices the large number of avoided crossings between the adiabatic potential

surfaces. Here non-adiabatic transitions mediated by the (neglected) oﬀ-diagonal coupling

terms of the kinetic energy are likely to occur. The uppermost surface, however, does not

exhibit such avoided crossings and is a possible candidate in order to achieve stable trap-

ping. According to our ﬁndings this surface is predominantly formed by the electronic state

possessing the largest possible orbital angular momentum in the n-manifold under consid-

eration. The corresponding quantum defects and relativistic corrections are therefore tiny

which a posteriori justiﬁes their neglect.

FIG. 1: Cut through the adiabatic potential surfaces of the n = 30-manifold (87Rb, G = 20 T/m,

B = 0.01 G). The high density of states is clearly visible. The uppermost potential surface is

predominantly formed by the atomic state with largest angular momentum. This particular surface

is clearly separated from the next lower ones whereas all other surfaces exhibit a number of avoided

crossings (see the magniﬁed view in the inset) at which non-adiabatic inter-surface transitions are

likely to occur.

The actual appearance of the potential surfaces depends on both, the gradient and the

strength of the homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld. In ﬁgure 1 the latter is comparatively small such

that for small displacements from the coordinate center its ﬁeld strength is easily sur-

passed by that of the gradient ﬁeld. The diﬀerent symmetry properties of the both ﬁelds

lead to a rearrangement of the energy surfaces ﬁnding its expression in the large num-

ber of avoided crossings. We now turn to the case where the Ioﬀe ﬁeld is large com-

only in the vicinity of the trap center. We assume this region to be suﬃciently large

such that at least a few low-lying c.m. states are localized here.

hence be continuously varied by tuning the Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength. In the present regime the

the multi-component c.m. wave function within these coupled potential surfaces constitutes

a very interesting problem. In the present investigation, however, we will focus exclusively

on the uppermost non-degenerate surface.

isotropic harmonic oscillator with a n-dependent frequency ω = Gq

Hence, by choosing high gradients and an appropriate tuning of the Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength B

n

very tightly conﬁning traps for highly excited atoms can be obtained. Such a situation is

depicted in ﬁgure 3 where we show the expectation values of the radii ρ = √X 2 + Y 2 and r

for the c.m. and electronic wave function versus the degree of excitation of the c.m. motion

ν. In the presented case the conﬁnement gives rise to a trap frequency of approximately

1.4 MHz. In this regime the size of the c.m. state characterized by

the electronic cloud, i.e. the c.m. wave function is stronger localized than the valence elec-

tron. On the other hand the expectation value

for the electron remains nearly constant

possessing the corresponding ﬁeld free value as the degree of excitation of the c.m. increases.

This indicates that in spite of the strong localization of the c.m. the electronic structure

of the atom is barely changed compared to the ﬁeld free case. This observation has been

backed up by calculating further electronic properties, such as the expectation values of L2

which also barely diﬀer from their corresponding ﬁeld free values. As previously indicated

we ﬁnd the electron in the highest angular momentum state (l = n

smallest radial uncertainty

the electronic wave function may not even overlap (see inset of ﬁgure 3). This novel regime

opens up the possibility to control Rydberg atoms in the quantum regime and might pave

the way to study many-body eﬀects in low-dimensional ultracold Rydberg gases [14].

In order to study the latter, ultracold atoms conﬁned in a tight atom chip trap [15] can

be transferred into high-l Rydberg states by imposing suitable optical and radio frequency

ﬁelds (see refs. [16, 17] and refs. therein). Since the electronic structure is barely aﬀected

even for tight c.m. conﬁnement the Rydberg atoms keep their well-known properties such

as long radiative lifetimes and electric dipole moments.

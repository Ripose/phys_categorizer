Stark-induced electric dipole amplitudes between states of the same nominal parity can be impor-
tant in experiments to observe parity nonconservation in atoms. The Stark-induced E1 amplitudes
between hyperﬁne sublevels of a single atomic state are considered. It is shown that in the ground
states of alkali atoms, such transitions are suppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to naive
expectations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst deﬁnitive observation of a nuclear spin-dependent (NSD) contribution to atomic parity nonconservation
(PNC) was recently reported [1]. This eﬀect arises primarily because of an electromagnetic interaction between
atomic electrons and the nucleus. In particular, because of PNC interactions within the nucleus, the nucleus acquires
a P-odd electromagnetic multipole moment known as the anapole moment [2,3]. Measurements of atomic NSD-PNC
amplitudes can thus be interpreted in terms of the nuclear anapole moment. The nuclear anapole moment itself can
be related to the strengths of various hadronic PNC couplings. These couplings are in general poorly determined, and
the available data are in some cases contradictory. Thus, there is considerable interest in additional measurements of
atomic NSD-PNC, as a means to probe hadronic neutral-weak interactions [4,5].

NSD-PNC eﬀects are extremely small, and their observation requires both extreme statistical sensitivity and careful
control over minute systematic eﬀects. Gorshkov et al. have proposed a novel technique for observing NSD-PNC [6].
They suggest using a strong microwave electric ﬁeld to drive PNC-induced electric dipole (E1) transitions between
hyperﬁne sublevels of a single atomic state. Interference between this E1 transition amplitude and a (parity-allowed)
M1 amplitude driven by a weak microwave magnetic ﬁeld (coherent with the electric ﬁeld) gives rise to a PNC
observable. This technique oﬀers the promise for unprecedented statistical sensitivity. However, Gorshkov et al. give
only a limited and qualitative analysis of possible systematic eﬀects in the measurement they propose.

Further consideration of the proposal of Ref. [6] has led us to investigate the phenomenon of Stark-induced (SI)
E1 transitions between hyperﬁne sublevels. These arise in the presence of a DC electric ﬁeld, which mixes states of
opposite parity into the initial and ﬁnal states; thus E1 transitions can be induced between one nominal state and
the admixed component of the other state [7]. Such transitions can be of importance in PNC measurements for two
reasons. First, the presence of stray electric ﬁelds leads to SI-E1 transition amplitudes between hyperﬁne sublevels,
which can mimic the eﬀect of the PNC-induced E1 amplitudes; the size of the SI amplitudes relative to the PNC-
induced amplitudes determines the extent to which stray ﬁelds must be controlled. Second, by deliberately applying
a large electric ﬁeld, the SI-E1 amplitude could in principle be used as the primary parity-allowed amplitude, against
which the PNC amplitude can interfere [7]. This technique gives excellent control over a variety of systematic eﬀects,
and indeed is the principle of the measurement of Ref. [1], in which the optical 6s-7s transition in Cs was studied.

We show here that in the particular case of alkali atoms (as discussed in Ref. [6]), the SI-E1 amplitudes between
hyperﬁne sublevels of the ground state are suppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to naive expectations. This
conclusion means that it is impossible in practice to use the SI amplitudes as the primary parity-allowed amplitude
in experiments of the type proposed by Gorshkov et al. On the other hand, it also means that systematic eﬀects due
to stray electric ﬁelds in such experiments are negligibly small under reasonable conditions.

The SI-E1 transition can be usefully understood as a special case of a two-photon transition, with one photon at zero
frequency. For electric dipole interactions, each photon has orbital angular momentum L = 0 with respect to the atom.
Thus, since each photon has spin S = 1, the two-photon system must have total angular momentum Jtot = Stot = 0, 1,
or 2. These three cases correspond to scalar (α), vector (β), and tensor (γ) transition amplitudes, respectively. We
are primarily interested here in transitions between sublevels of the s1/2 ground state of an alkali atom. For this case,
each of the three possible amplitudes is strongly suppressed (or vanishes), although for three diﬀerent reasons. The
a3
suppression we speak of here is relative to the naive estimate of the amplitude: A

Bohr radius and

is the Rydberg constant).

Next, we show that for hyperﬁne transitions, the vector amplitude β is suppressed by a factor

First, we note that the scalar amplitude α vanishes for hyperﬁne transitions. This is a trivial consequence of the fact
that the scalar amplitude cannot change any angular quantum numbers, and thus cannot contribute to any transitions
between sublevels of the same state. This argument fails when the principal quantum number changes; thus, for the

is the ﬁne-structure constant. This suppression can be understood as a consequence of Bose statistics for photons.
For Stot=1, the spin component of a two-photon wavefunction is antisymmetric under interchange of the two photons.
Thus, the space-time component of the wavefunction must also be antisymmetric under interchange, in order to
satisfy Bose statistics. In the electric-dipole approximation, where the spatial part of the wavefunction is constant,
the total wavefunction must therefore vanish if the photons have the same energy. (This statement is closely related
to the Landau-Yang theorem of high-energy physics, which states that the decay of a J=1 particle into two photons
is forbidden [9,10].) In the limit where the frequencies of the two photons are close but not identical, the vector part
of the two-photon transition amplitude does not vanish, but is suppressed by a factor
, where ¯hωi is the

vector to scalar amplitudes is β/α = 0.1 [13]. For the hyperﬁne transitions of interest here, the vector amplitude is
thus suppressed relative to its naive value by an overall factor

suﬃcient to produce a tensor amplitude, we expect that its presence should not signiﬁcantly alter the magnitude of
γ. Rather, the tensor amplitude can be understood from the hypothetical case of an atom with nuclear spin, but no
electron spin. In this case, the only relevant hyperﬁne splitting is that due to the interaction of p-states with the
nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Thus, γ is suppressed relative to its naive value by a factor

In the general case the transition amplitude is fully described by three independent reduced amplitudes with K =

¿From here on we will use the reduced amplitudes AK rather than α, β, and γ, since the irreducible tensor formalism
makes it possible to write expressions in a general form for all K.

At this stage let us assume that there is no nuclear spin and levels are described by quantum numbers ji, mi. Then

we can replace the matrix elements of rq in (2) in terms of reduced matrix elements, e.g.

vanishing of s

To obtain numerical values of these amplitudes we need to know the radial integrals Rn0p,n0s and hyperﬁne constants
An0s and An0pj . They are given in Table I together with our results for the amplitudes A1 and A2. The uncertainty
in these values arises primarily from the two approximations we have made, namely: neglecting intermediate p-states
with n > n0 in the sum of equation (14), and neglecting the j-dependence of radial matrix elements. We estimate
that these approximations introduce errors of <

As stated in the introduction, the motivation for this calculation was the eﬀect of the SI-E1 amplitudes in ex-
periments to measure PNC in hyperﬁne transitions.
In order to make the SI-E1 amplitudes comparable to the
parity-allowed M1 transitions between hyperﬁne sublevels (and thus to use the SI-E1 amplitudes as the primary
µB. Even for Fr, where A attains its largest value, this is achieved
parity-allowed amplitude), it is necessary that A

only for E
compare the magnitude of the SI-E1 amplitudes to the PNC-induced E1 amplitudes. Using the values for the PNC

the lighter alkalis.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The state of the art in compact atomic frequency refer-
ences is represented by devices about 100 cm3 in volume,
dissipating several watts of power [1], and maintaining
relative frequency stability of about 10−11 over one day.
Current atomic magnetometers can achieve high sensitiv-
[2], [3, 4]) but are typically
ity (see, for example, Refs.
large and nonportable or cumbersome to carry. Recently,
physics packages for highly compact clocks [5, 6] and
magnetometers [7] have been developed that are based on
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) micromachin-
ing techniques and promise to allow even further reduc-
tion of the size and power of these types of instruments.
Until now, all of these compact devices have been based
on alkali-vapor cells containing a buﬀer gas. However the
use of anti-relaxation coated cells in such devices may
have a number of beneﬁts, including a reduced sensitivity
to ﬁeld gradients and a signiﬁcantly narrower resonance
linewidth at very small size scales (see, for example, Ref.
[8]).

With anti-relaxation coatings, polarized alkali atoms
(Cs, Rb, K) can experience multiple wall collisions (up
to 104) without depolarization. Recent experimental in-
vestigations [9, 10] have explored Zeeman and hyperﬁne
relaxation in rubidium- and potassium-metal-vapor cells
with diﬀerent paraﬃn coatings. The characteristic cell
dimensions in those works were 3 to 10 cm.

Here we investigate nonlinear magneto-optical signals
with millimeter-scale paraﬃn-coated cells with cesium.
We verify the scaling of the relaxation properties with
cell size for millimeter-scale cells and discuss the practical
aspects of magnetometric measurements with such cells.
We have found the 3-mm cells appropriate for small-
scale magnetometers (and, probably, clocks), and veri-
ﬁed that the intrinsic Zeeman-relaxation rate at a given
alkali-vapor pressure scales approximately as 1/D, where

D is the characteristic dimension of the cell, for cell sizes
varying by 1.5 orders of magnitude. We also compared
nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR) signals us-
ing two diﬀerent types of laser modulation – frequency
modulation (FM NMOR [11]) and amplitude modula-
tion – AM NMOR. We ﬁnd that the AM NMOR signals
are comparable to the FM NMOR signals in terms of
width and signal strength, suggesting that the method
of choice may depend on the ease of implementation in a
particular experiment or device. Finally, the NMOR sig-
nals observed in this work at relatively high light power
show evidence of conversion between alignment created
in atoms by the laser light and other polarization mo-
ments such as orientation.

II. THE CELL

The cell used for the measurements reported here is
shown in Fig. 1. The general technology for cell prepara-
tion and application of the paraﬃn coating is described
in Ref.
[12]. The cell was made by glass-blowing tech-
niques and is of an approximately spherical shape, with
an outer diameter of about 3 mm and wall thickness of
about 0.2 to 0.3 mm. A cesium-metal sample is placed
in a stem (made at the same time as the cell) that is con-
nected to the cell via a thin capillary about 0.2 mm in
diameter and about 2 mm in length. The broader section
of the stem on the side of the capillary opposite to the
cell contains Cs metal and is about 6 mm long.

III. APPARATUS, PROCEDURE, AND
RESULTS

Most of the measurements reported here were per-
formed by the FM NMOR technique [11]. Recent reviews
of nonlinear magneto-optics of resonant vapors are given
[13, 14]. The vapor cell at room temperature
in Refs.
was mounted within a cylindrical double-layered mag-
netic shield. We used a distributed-feedback (DFB) laser
producing up to 10 mW of cw light, tuned to the Cs D1

to-peak frequency-modulation depth of ∆ν = 750 MHz.
The upper trace on the ﬁgure shows the quadrature (out-
of-phase) output of the lock-in ampliﬁer, while the lower
trace (which is vertically oﬀset for clarity) represents the
in-phase output. As usual in FM NMOR experiments,
there is a dispersively shaped resonance in the in-phase
component that appears near zero magnetic ﬁeld, as
well as dispersively shaped resonances that appear when

frequency, g is the Land´e factor of the ground-state hy-
perﬁne component (g =
1/4 for the Cs F = 4, 3 states,
respectively), µ is the Bohr magneton, and B is the mag-
netic ﬁeld. Absorptively shaped quadrature resonances
also appear when ΩM = 2 ΩL. The origin of all these
features is well understood qualitatively [11], and they
are reproduced in an analytical calculation with a model
system [15].

We use the scans such as the one shown in Fig. 2 to de-
termine the Zeeman-relaxation rate γ. To do this, we ﬁt
the resonances to appropriately phased Lorentzians and
determine their width δB. The width δB corresponds to
the separation between the minimum and the maximum
of the dispersively shaped features in the in-phase signals.
We then evaluate the relaxation rate from γ = 2π
µ δB.
|
The rate γ has a contribution due to light-power broad-
ening.
In order to ﬁnd the intrinsic light-independent
relaxation rate, we take data at several low light-power
levels, and extrapolate to zero light power (Fig. 3). The
data shown in Fig. 3 were taken over a period of less
than an hour on one day. The intrinsic relaxation rate
obtained from these data is γ/(2π) = 24.4(5) Hz (cor-
responding to the resonance width as a function of the
magnetic ﬁeld of 0.07 mG). On a diﬀerent day (on which
the scan of Fig. 2 was taken), we observed smaller in-
trinsic relaxation rates, down to 10 to 15 Hz. We at-
tribute this variation to the change in the equilibrium
vapor density in the cell. Indeed, previous work [9, 16]
has produced evidence that wall relaxation of polarized
atoms in paraﬃn-coated cells is strongly dependent on
the vapor density in the cell.

Figure 4 shows the dependence of the signal size vs.
light power. The data points correspond to those in Fig.
3. The power dependence of the signal in the low-power
limit is expected to be quadratic because the signal is pro-
portional to the light power times the angle of the nonlin-
ear light-polarization rotation, which is in turn propor-
tional to the power. As seen in Fig. 4, signiﬁcant devia-
tions from this asymptotic low-power behavior occur at
essentially all light powers where data were taken, and
certainly at
0.5 µW, where the dependence appears
linear. Similar saturation behavior was seen in earlier
work on FM NMOR with Rb [17].

line (with wavelength in vacuum of λ = 894.6 nm). The
laser beam was attenuated, passed through a Glan po-
larizer, and directed through holes in the magnetic shield
through the vapor cell. The light beam was apertured to
about 2 mm in diameter before entering the cell. The cur-
vature of the cell caused the transmitted light beam to
diverge. This divergence was compensated by installing
a 2.5 cm-diameter anti-reﬂection coated lens with a focal
length of 2.5 cm at a distance of 0.15 cm after the cell.
The light after the lens exited the magnetic shield and
was analyzed with a Wollaston polarizer and a balanced
photoreceiver whose output was connected to a digital-
signal-processing lock-in ampliﬁer. The laser frequency
was sinusoidally modulated by dithering the junction cur-
rent, and the synchronous signal due to optical rotation
was detected.

·

From auxiliary absorption measurements, we esti-
mated the Cs-vapor density in the cell to be approxi-
109 cm−3. This density is an order of magni-
mately 3
tude lower than the saturated density of Cs at room tem-
perature, in our experience, a not-too-uncommon occur-
rence in paraﬃn-coated cells (the density can usually be
brought closer to the saturated density by reheating the
stem; however, this was not needed here, as the signals
were suﬃciently strong even with this low alkali-vapor
density). A solenoid was installed within the innermost
magnetic shield and was used to set or scan the mag-
netic ﬁeld applied to the cell directed collinearly with
the light-propagation direction (the Faraday-rotation ge-
ometry). In a typical measurement, we would tune the
central frequency of the laser to a particular value near
the resonance, set the modulation frequency and ampli-
tude, and record the output of the lock-in ampliﬁer as a
function of the magnetic ﬁeld.

An example of such an FM NMOR scan is shown in
Fig. 2. For this scan, the light power transmitted through
0.12 µW, and the modulation frequency
the cell was
4 kHz, with the peak-
of the laser was set to ΩM = 2π

IV. SPECIFICS OF MAGNETO-OPTICS WITH
SMALL COATED CELLS; ESTIMATE OF
SENSITIVITY

The results described above show that strong nonlin-
ear magneto-optical-rotation signals appropriate for use
in magnetometers can readily be obtained in millimeter-
scale paraﬃn-coated vapor cells (Fig. 9 shows a spec-
tral scan where the signals have been normalized, so the
ﬁrst-harmonic amplitudes of the optical rotation are pre-
sented). We point out that Cs has an advantage for use
in magnetometers based on atomic alignment (and higher
polarization moments) because its hyperﬁne structure is
fully resolved (due to large upper-state hyperﬁne split-
ting of 1168 MHz in the 6 2P1/2 state and smaller Doppler

width compared to lighter alkali atoms). As will be dis-
cussed in more detail in Ref. [10], there is considerable
suppression of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation when
upper-state hyperﬁne structure is not fully resolved (a
particularly strong suppression, by two orders of magni-
tude compared to cesium, in the case of potassium).

A concern in using small cells in magneto-optical work
is the eﬀect of optical imperfection of glass-blown cells
and the curvature of the cell’s surfaces. We found that,
although we needed to use a lens to correct for the cell’s
curvature, this does not present a serious problem. We
also found that, presumably due to stress-induced bire-
fringence in the glass, linearly polarized light acquired
signiﬁcant ellipticity (up to
0.1 rad) upon propagation
∼
through the cell. Ellipticity could lead to oﬀsets in the
polarimeter signals due to self-rotation [18]. We have
also observed that the ellipticity causes phase shifts for
nonzero B-ﬁeld resonances and an asymmetry between
positive and negative B-ﬁeld resonances at relatively high
light powers (Fig. 9). We were able to aﬀect and largely
compensate these distortions by placing a quarter-wave
plate before the cell and adjusting it to compensate the
ellipticity. This problem could be eliminated completely
through the use of planar, microfabricated cells as de-
scribed in [19]. These cells have windows made from thin,
ﬂat glass wafers and are expected to have signiﬁcantly
less birefringence than the cell used in this experiment.
While no systematic optimization or characterization
of the magnetometer performance was attempted in the
present work, we have measured that the setup in the
present incarnation is a magnetometer with a sensitiv-
ity to low frequency (< 50 Hz) variations in the mag-
4 pT/√Hz. For this measurement, the
netic ﬁeld of
response of the system was determined by stepping the
frequency of the laser-frequency modulation by 1 or 2 Hz
and measuring the voltage change at the in-phase out-
put of the lock-in ampliﬁer. This gives the slope as a
function of frequency, which is then converted to a slope

as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. Noise was evaluated by
connecting the output of the lock-in ampliﬁer to a spec-
trum analyzer. The magnetic sensitivity was measured
with laser power of 310 nW, peak-to-peak frequency-
modulation amplitude of 992 MHz, and the laser center
frequency tuned to maximize the slope,

V. NONLINEAR MAGNETO-OPTICAL
ROTATION WITH AMPLITUDE-MODULATED
LIGHT (AM NMOR)

We have also brieﬂy explored an alternative technique
to FM NMOR, where instead of frequency modulat-
ing the laser synchronously with the Larmor precession,
laser-light amplitude is modulated instead (AM NMOR).
In fact, this technique of synchronous optical pumping is
similar to that described in the pioneering work of Bell
Important diﬀerences with the early
and Bloom [20].
work include that we pump transverse atomic alignment
rather than a combination of longitudinal alignment and
orientation, and that we synchronously detect optical ro-
tation rather than transmission (see review article [14]
for a discussion of various dynamic nonlinear magneto-
optical processes and references to related work).

To achieve amplitude modulation of the laser power,
the light beam was passed through a commercial acousto-
optical modulator-deﬂector (AOM) operated at the
acoustic frequency of 80 MHz. The drive of the AOM
could be controlled by applying a TTL signal from a func-
tion generator. To compare AM and FM NMOR signals,
we recorded both types of signals at the same modula-
tion frequency, and otherwise similar experimental con-
ditions (Fig. 5). For the AM data shown, we used square-
wave (on/oﬀ) modulation of the laser power with a 50 %
duty cycle. Comparison of the AM and FM NMOR data
shown in Fig. 5 shows that both modulation methods
produce similar signals.

An interesting result of the comparison is that the
quadrature signals are more signiﬁcantly suppressed with
respect to the in-phase signals in the case of FM NMOR.
We hypothesize that this is due to less eﬃcient conver-
sion of the induced atomic alignment into other polariza-
tion multipoles due to a factor-of-two lower average light
power to which the atoms are exposed in the AM case.
In general, the AM and FM NMOR spectra are diﬀerent.
Consequently, the relative merits of the two methods for
magnetometry will have to be assessed by a careful inves-
tigation and separate optimization of various parameters
involved in the measurement (light power, tuning of the
central light frequency, AM duty cycle, etc.). This work
is in progress elsewhere [21].

As seen in Fig. 5, the AM NMOR signals are nois-
ier than their FM NMOR counterparts, particularly in
the case of the in-phase signal. The origin of this is not
presently understood. We suspect that this is due to el-
evated sensitivity to laser-frequency noise, a point that

(lower plot) signals taken in similar conditions. These data
were taken at light power (maximum light power in the AM
case) of ≈ 1.8 µW with modulation frequency of 4 kHz in
both cases. Small dispersive features at zero magnetic ﬁeld
are due to imperfect phasing of the lock-in ampliﬁer.

requires further study.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have

conducted measurements of nonlinear
magneto-optical-rotation signals with frequency- and
amplitude-modulated light (FM and AM NMOR) with
millimeter-scale paraﬃn-coated Cs cells. The results in-
dicate that such cells are promising for the development
of small-scale magnetometers. While no systematic opti-
mization or characterization of the magnetometer perfor-
mance was attempted in the present work, the measured
4 pT/√Hz suggests that sub-picotesla
sensitivity of
magnetometry might be possible with highly miniatur-
ized devices. Since atomic magnetometers and clocks are
essentially similar devices, we also expect that coated
cells with volumes comparable to the one studied in this
work could ﬁnd application in secondary frequency stan-
dards.

We have investigated the spectra of FM NMOR sig-
nals for diﬀerent modulation amplitudes and light pow-
ers (Fig. 6). In order to remove the contributions to the
spectra that do not have sharp resonant character with
respect to magnetic ﬁeld, we have subtracted spectra
recorded at the minimum and maximum of the negative-
B feature. The nonresonant contributions were typically
at a level
50 % of the resonant signal. These
contributions are related to such eﬀects as etaloning on
the optical elements, residual misbalance of the polarime-
ter, etc. The plots in Fig. 6 indicate some variations in
the shape of the spectrum from low to high powers, and
a more dramatic variation with the modulation ampli-
tude. While the spectrum for low frequency-modulation
amplitudes is composed of dispersively shaped features
corresponding to the diﬀerent hyperﬁne components of
the transition, the high-modulation-amplitude spectra
are mostly absorptively shaped. Qualitatively, this is
because at low modulation amplitudes, the spectrum is
similar to the derivative of the non-modulated NMOR
(see Ref.
[11]), while at high modulation amplitudes,
the peaks occur when the central frequency of the laser
is detuned in such a way that the the laser frequency
is in resonance with the atoms at either the maximum
(positive peaks) or the minimum (negative peaks) of its
frequency excursion. This, in a sense, is equivalent to
low-duty cycle (short-pulse) interaction of the laser light

with the atoms synchronous with the Larmor precession.
The peaks corresponding to a given hyperﬁne component
are of opposite signs for positive and negative detuning
because optical rotation is maximal at opposite phases of
the laser-frequency modulation.

For practical applications of FM NMOR,

it is im-
portant to optimize various parameters of the system,
including light power, central laser-frequency detuning,
modulation amplitude, etc. The ﬁgure of merit for the
magnetometer performance depends on the signal size
and resonance linewidth. While a full optimization was
not attempted here, Fig. 7 shows the dependence of the
maximum signal on the modulation amplitude at diﬀer-
ent light powers. To obtain this dependence, the modula-
tion frequency was ﬁxed, and the central laser frequency
was scanned to obtained spectra similar to those shown
in Fig. 6. The plots in Fig. 7 show the amplitudes of the
largest (low-frequency; see Fig. 6) peaks in the spectra
normalized by light power.

be due to the conversion of laser-induced atomic align-
ment into orientation and other, higher, polarization mo-
ments (see reviews [13, 14] and references therein). Such
conversion occurs due to the combined action of the mag-
netic ﬁeld and the ac electric ﬁeld of the light on the
polarized atoms.

As a result of such polarization-moment conversion,
components of polarization are created that do not un-
dergo Larmor precession (for example, orientation di-
rected along the magnetic ﬁeld). Such polarization com-
ponents would not contribute to the synchronous signals
we detect if unmodulated probe light were used for detec-
tion. (They would contribute to time-independent opti-
cal rotation of the probe.) In the present case, however,
the pump and probe light are the same and are both
modulated. Thus, this “static” rotation also acquires a
time dependence that is in phase with the laser-frequency
modulation. Since the spectra of optical rotation for dif-
ferent polarization multipoles are, in general, diﬀerent,
it is not surprising that these diﬀerences also manifest
themselves in the diﬀerences between the in-phase and
quadrature spectra.

FIG. 9: A calibrated high-light-power (11.7 µW) magnetic-
ﬁeld scan. The FM NMOR signals are normalized, so the
signals are given in terms of the amplitude of the ﬁrst har-
monic of the optical rotation. Upper trace – quadrature sig-
nal; lower trace – in-phase signal. The laser frequency was
modulated at 4 kHz with a peak-to-peak modulation ampli-
tude of 750 MHz. The amplitude of the quadrature signal
is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the in-phase signal. The
positive- and negative-B resonance signals show considerable
asymmetry (see text).

Evidence for conversion of laser-induced alignment into
other polarization multipoles also comes from the fact
that, while the amplitudes of the in-phase and quadra-
ture signals for the nonzero B-ﬁeld resonances are the
same at low light powers, the relative size of the quadra-
ture signals decreases greatly at higher light powers. For
example, the quadrature-signal amplitudes are about a
factor of ﬁve smaller than the in-phase ones for the light
12 µW (see Fig. 9). This trend is also seen
power of
in the comparison of the quadrature and in-phase ampli-
tudes shown in Fig. 7.

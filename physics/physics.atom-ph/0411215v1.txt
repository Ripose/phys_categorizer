Calculations of liquid helium and neon VUV emission spectra, self-absorption and
scattering for a neutrino detector

(Dated: August 13, 2013)

VUV emission, self-absorption, and scattering of liquid helium and neon are considered. Our
theoretical emission spectra are found in agreement with experimental observations. Result for
Rayleigh scattering lengths are compared with other calculations: the agreement is found in the
case of neon, but our helium scattering length is much smaller. The absorption and scattering are
signiﬁcant on the scale of proposed neutrino detector.

Recently, McKinsey and Doyle [1] has proposed the
detection of low energy neutrinos released from the Sun
and supernovae with the scheme called CLEAN, Cryo-
genic Low Energy Astrophysics with Noble Gas. The
central element of a CLEAN detector is a 6-meter diam-
eter Dewar ﬁlled with liquid neon which is functioning
both as a passive shielding medium and an active self-
shielding detector. The advantage of liquid neon is high
scintillation yield and low radiactive background. Other
noble-gas liquids can be used as well, of particular in-
terest is liquid helium. The self-absorption and scatter-
ing of UV light produced by these liquids are critical for
determination of the size of the detector, the interpre-
tation of neutrino events, and exclusion of background
events. The emission of liquid helium and neon in UV
has already been studied [2, 3, 4] and scattering lengths
of noble-gas liquids at scintillation wavelengths has been
estimated from extrapolations of refraction indices [5];
the self-absorption is yet to be measured. Because there
are many factors such as spectral reshaping and the ef-
fects of impurities (for example, 0.2% of N2 impurities in
liquid helium reduces the emission intensity by 20-40% in
the region 700-850˚A [2]) that inﬂuence the interpretation
of the experimental results, the theoretical calculations
of emission, self-absorption, and scattering, which con-
stitute the subject of this letter, are important. Spectral
properties of noble-gas liquids are not well understood
mostly due to interdisciplinary nature (atomic, molecu-
lar, condensed-matter physics) of the phenomenon as well
as the scarcity of the data, so this letter also has the aim
of attracting the attention of theorists of diverse expertise
and motivating further UV spectroscopic measurements.

The scintillation of liquid helium due to energetic α-
particle stopped in the liquid was ﬁrst studied by Moss
and Hereford [6] and by Kane et al. [7]. Moss and Here-
ford [6] observed signiﬁcant decrease of the intensity be-
low λ-point, and attributed this to the change of the
oscillator strength of 2P-1S He transition due to the dif-
ferences in spatial distribution of nearest neighbors in
the superﬂuid and the normal ﬂuid. The emission spec-
trum of liquid helium was also studied experimentally
by Stockton et al. [3] who obtained and compared UV
spectra of electron-bombarded superﬂuid helium at 1.4

2(A1Σ+

and 2.1 K with those of high-pressure helium discharge
lamp in the range of 1000-600 ˚A. The spectra were very
similar, but the liquid spectrum had an earlier cut-oﬀ at
about 600 ˚A due to stronger absorption. Keto et al. [8]
and Hill et al. [9] showed that the ionization of the he-
lium results in formation of He∗
2(a3Σ+
u )
dimers in the liquid which decaying produce UV scin-
tillation. A number of publications [10, 11, 12, 13] ad-
dressed an unusual phenomenon in liquid helium such as
the formation of cavities around free electrons and ex-
cited atoms and molecules. The dynamics of the forma-
tions of cavities is fast, 5 × 10−11 s [10], so that excited
molecules do not decay signiﬁcantly during the time of
cavity formation in which case the liquid eﬀects on the
spectral properties are greatly reduced.

u ) and He∗

The luminescent spectrum of liquid and solid neon was
observed by Packard et al. [4] in the range 700-900 ˚A. It
is interesting to note that the solid has a narrow peak
at 743 ˚A , but the liquid does not; similar peaks in solid
and liquid exist at 774 ˚A with widths about 30 ˚A. The
luminescence of neon gas was also brieﬂy investigated:
at low pressure P < 40 Torr, a single narrow line was
detected near 743 ˚A. At higher pressures, the intensity
of the 743 ˚A line decreased but the second line at 800 ˚A
appeared. At low temperature, 25 K, the 800 ˚A line does
not persist.

Absorption and emission spectra of liquids can be ob-
tained approximately from the spectra of molecules. For
example, in Ref.[3] it was found that lines in the 600˚A
band of He2 appear in the liquid emission spectrum and
can be well predicted from potential curves of the pair in-
teraction using Franck-Condon principle. We would like
to apply this principle to obtain theoretical UV emis-
sion in helium and neon liquids (molecules) near 16 eV.
The main peak of helium scintillation according to Ref.[3]
appears around 15.5 eV (800˚A), and neon liquid scintil-
lation was observed at 16 eV [4]. For calculations of the
wavelength of the maximum of emission it is enough to
know the equilibrium interatomic distance (Req) of the
lowest singlet excited molecular state, the energy of this
state, and the interatomic energy of two ground state
atoms at the distance Req. Detailed spectral distribu-
tion can be obtained from the overlap of wave functions

potentials obtained from the overlap theory, the extrapolation
using the expansion of Ref.[24], and ab initio calculations with
exponentially correlated Gaussian functions [18]

of nuclear motion, according to the classical work by Con-
don [14]. Absorption transitions start from ground state
atoms which are separated by a relatively large distance.
Thus the small energy shift due to environment can be
neglected and it is a reasonable approximation to con-
sider only the strongest allowed atomic transitions which
have transition energies close to the emission energy of
about 16 eV.

The helium interatomic or molecular potentials are
well-known [15, 16, 17, 18]. The potential curves of the
lowest excited states of Ne2 are given in Ref.[19]. The
ground state of neon diatomic molecule is investigated
in [20, 21, 22, 23]. Analytical expansions of the ground-
state interatomic potentials of noble-gas atoms that re-
produce well the available vibrational spectra are given
in [24]. Most studies do not consider small interatomic
distances in detail which are important for our applica-
tion, so we supplement them with our own calculations
described below.

Our ab initio ground-state interatomic potentials at
small distances are calculated using Pauli’s principle.
When two closed-shell atoms have wavefunctions over-
lapping, electrons are promoted to excited atomic states
increasing the energy of each atom. In helium, the repop-
ulation increases the energy by 22 eV times overlap and
in neon 16 eV times overlap. Wavefunction overlaps are
obtained using Dirac-Hartree-Fock potentials, 1s2 in the
case of helium and 1s22s22p6 in the case of neon. Over-
laps of all electrons of one atom with those of the other
are taken into account. In the range of interatomic en-
ergies of interest for self-absorption other eﬀects such as
electrostatic direct and exchange interactions are weaker
because of screening. We have checked the magnitude of
electrostatic eﬀects in case of helium, and found that the
dominant contribution comes from the Pauli principle.

In Fig.1 we show the comparison of the ground-state
helium interatomic potentials obtained from the over-

lap theory, the extrapolation using the expansion of
Ref.[24], and ab initio calculations with exponentially
correlated Gaussian (ECG) functions [18]. The expan-
[18] up
[24] agrees well with calculations of
sion of
to 10 eV indicating good precision of both methods.
The overlap calculations agree with the expansion re-
sults over a larger range, with some deviation in the
middle of the curve due to approximations of our the-
ory. We can conclude that our method describes well
the repulsive interaction in helium and the expansion
method is suitable for calculations below 10 eV. In the
case of neon (Fig.2), we ﬁnd close agreement between
diﬀerent methods:
the overlap theory, the extrapola-
tion from experiment[24], conﬁguration-interaction (CI)
method[22], and self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) calculations
[23] below 8 eV. We also found agreement between our
method and that of Ref.[24] in argon, although not as
close as in neon. Therefore, the expansion of Ref.[24]
gives the energies of ground state noble-gas dimers with
suﬃcient precision for calculations of emission spectra
and the analysis of self-absorption.

The emission spectra of helium and neon molecules
are shown in Fig.3. The initial He excited state has equi-
librium distance Re = 1 ˚A , energy 18.2 eV and the
harmonic-oscillator frequency ωe = 1861 cm−1 [17]. Cor-
responding values for the Ne 3s3Σu initial state are 1.75˚A
16.11 eV and 540 cm−1 [19, 22]. Neglecting anharmonic
corrections, we can write the nuclear wavefunction of the
lowest vibrational state as

here α = (2πµcωe/¯h)1/2, µ is the reduced mass, c is the
speed of light. Since only direct transitions are the most
probable, the absorption spectrum will have the weight-
ing factor |Ψ(R)|2. The helium theoretical molecular
spectrum is in better agreement with the emission spec-

FIG. 3: Theoretical helium and neon VUV emission spectra.
The intensity is normalized to the maximum

trum observed in condensed helium discarge [3, 25] than
with that observed in liquid [2, 3]. High-pressure dis-
charge emission has maximum located at 15.3 eV [3, 25],
while theoretical prediction is 15 eV, and the maximum of
the emission of liquid is located at 15.5 eV [3] and 15.8 eV
[2]. The width at half maximum of discharge spectrum
is 2 eV [3], the same as our prediction, while the liquid
spectrum has the width about 3 eV [2, 3]. From this
comparison, we can conclude that the liquid eﬀects shift
the energy by 0.5-0.8 eV and broaden the spectrum by
1 eV. A similar situation occurs in neon. High-pressure
neon discharge gives the maximum of emission at 15.5
eV, while the liquid has the maximum at 16 eV [4]; the
theoretical prediction is 15.2 eV. The theoretical width
is about 1 eV, and width of the liquid spectrum obtained
with 1 eV resolution is about 2 eV. The liquid eﬀects re-
sult in shift of at least 0.5 eV and broadening less than
1 eV. The shift is not easy to explain; we can suggest
that the interactions of more than two atoms can be re-
sponsible and the distance between an excited atom and
closest ground state atoms can be diﬀerent than that in
the diatomic molecule. Our theory was not tested for ex-
cited states, but for ground state atoms it can be used: if
one atom is located between two other atoms at distance
R then from the Pauli’s principle one can show that the
energy of the middle atom will be doubled compared to
the pair at the same distance.

Apart from calculations of emission spectra, we also in-
vestigated various absorption mechanisms and found that
the dominant absorption is due to the Lorentzian wings of
the radiatively-broadened proﬁle. Near resonance colli-
sional broadening would be more important; however, the
impact approximation from which the Lorentzian shape-
factor can be derived is not valid for far-oﬀ-resonance
transitions and instead more appropriate is quasi-static
approximation (see for example [26], pp. 241-245) in
which the absorption proﬁle is determined from prob-
abilities W (R)dR of nearest particles within the range
of distances (R, R+dR) from a given atom. Either the

classical distribution or quantum-mechanical wavefunc-
tions can be used to obtain these probabilities. In the
classical case, the Boltzman distribution for low temper-
atures of the liquids gives very strong exponential sup-
pression for the detuning of order 1 eV and the absorp-
tion can be neglected. On the other hand, the consider-
ation of wavefunctions of nuclear motion (the tunnelling
into classically-forbidden region) gives negligible increase
in absorption because the tunnelling probability is small
and the energy deﬁcit will remain whether the tunnelling
occurs in the ground state, excited state, or both.

For large detuning and radiative broadening, the ab-
sorption coeﬃcient can be found from the equation (see
for example Ref.[27])

culations. Using potential curves we obtained emission
spectra which agree well with experimentally observed
condensed discharge spectra, although liquid emission is
shifted due to liquid eﬀects. We have considered various
mechanisms of self-absorption and found that the radia-
tive broadening is the dominant mechanism if the emis-
sion absorption oﬀset exceeds 1 eV. The self-absorption
is signiﬁcant at the scale of the proposed neutrino detec-
tor and can impose restrictions on the experiment; for-
tunately, non-radiative relaxation seems to be slow and
the absorption results mostly in re-emission so that it is
similar to scattering. We have also calculated dielectric
constants and Rayleigh scattering parameter. Results
are in agreement with previous calculations for neon, but
in disagreement for helium. We understand now domi-
nant eﬀects of the emission, self-absorption, and scat-
tering, but some questions remain and need further in-
vestigation: the explanation of liquid shift, measurement
of scattering and absorption lengths, other liquid eﬀects,
quenching mechanisms. The author is grateful to Dr.
McKinsey for valuable discussions and comments on the
manuscript.

Our result for the neon dielectric constant of 1.53 is in
good agreement with the value 1.52 given in Ref.[5], but
helium has some deviation: our value is 1.156 vs 1.077.
The reason for the deviation can be inaccuracy of the
extrapolation used in Ref.[5]; since oscillator strengths of
helium are known with high precision, there is no reason
for extrapolation except for the inclusion of continuum
contribution.

In our calculations we found that absorption length is
smaller than the size of the neutrino detector, so that it
is important to know whether the excited atom re-emits
an absorbed photon or is quenched non-radiatively. Be-
cause for non-radiative decay triplet and single states are
similar and in Ref.[31] it has been found that lifetime of
the helium triplet state in solid exceeds 15 s, we can con-
clude that quenching is a slow process and the total emis-
sion power will not be reduced much. The absorption-re-
emission process is equivalent to the scattering.

In this paper we have analyzed UV emission, self-
absorption, and scattering of liquid helium and neon. For
emission spectra we have found reliable data for helium
and neon molecules, developed our own model of repul-
sive interaction to check and understand the existing cal-

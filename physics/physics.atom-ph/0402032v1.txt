Abstract

The properties of low-density, low-energy matter wavepackets propagating through waveguide

bends are investigated. Time-dependent quantum mechanical calculations using simple harmonic

oscillator conﬁning potentials are performed for a range of parameters close to those accessible

by recent “atom chip”-based experiments. We compare classical calculations based on Ehrenfest’s

theorem to these results to determine whether classical mechanics can predict the amount of

transverse excitation as measured by the transverse heating. The present results thus elucidate

some of the limits for which matter wave propagation through microstructures can be reliably

considered using classical particle motion.

INTRODUCTION

Recent experimental progress in atomic physics includes the success of magnetic micro-

traps [1] — the so-called “atom chips” [2] — where combinations of magnetic ﬁelds and

wires layed on silica substrates have made possible atom traps, guides and devices all above

a single chip [3, 4].

The strong magnetic ﬁeld gradients created by microtraps have already proven their

versatility. Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) have been created above microchip surfaces

using evaporation [5, 6, 7, 8] and also by using the surface itself as a hot atom knife to

condense a cloud of atoms [9, 10]. These achievements are signiﬁcant since a BEC is the most

likely source to feed atom-optical devices as they provide a large number of coherent atoms.

In fact, the controlled propagation of BECs through atom chip waveguides has already been

demonstrated [11, 12, 13], and some sources of decoherence have been identiﬁed [8, 14, 15].

Non-linear interactions in atom optics can be useful [16], but recent theoretical inves-

tigations have demonstrated that such eﬀects can potentially degrade atom optical device

performance [17, 18, 19, 20]. Furthermore, despite the possibility of using multi-moded mat-

ter waves [21, 22, 23], the low-density regime with single-mode propagation is expected to

make atom optical devices much simpler and easier to operate. With this in mind, previous

theoretical investigations of the low-velocity, low-density matter wave limit have delineated

the conditions for single-moded wave propagation through microstructures [24, 25, 26, 27].

In the present paper, we further explore the conditions under which propagation is single-

moded, and the extent to which classical mechanics can predict the transverse excitation.

Speciﬁcally, the time-dependent scattering of a wavepacket through a circular bend is inves-

tigated, neglecting atom-atom interactions. The curved waveguide is a fundamental system

that forms the basis for many geometries already experimentally realised, such as multiple

circular bends [28], storage rings [29], spiral guides [30] and stadium shaped traps [31]. Note

that these experiments all used atoms with relatively high energies, not ground mode atoms,

and thus the atomic motion was modelled using Monte Carlo ensembles of classical particles

[28, 29, 30].

The time-dependent quantum mechanical calculations explore the low-energy, tight bend

limit, as well as regimes not easily accessible with our previous time-independent calculations

of the circular bend system [26]: large radii bends and small de Broglie wavelengths. Classical

That is, the center-of-mass motion of a wavepacket can be approximated by a single trajec-

tory of a classical particle, which we call the Ehrenfest trajectory. While Ehrenfest’s theorem

is generally exact for simple harmonic oscillators (SHOs), our bend is only an SHO in the

transverse direction. So, the question asked here is how well the approximation introduced

in Eq. (1) reproduces the exact Ehrenfest’s theorem, and thus the quantum mechanical re-

sults. We are not, however, testing the use of Monte Carlo ensembles of classical particles to

approximate the quantum observables. J¨a¨askel¨ainen and Stenholm [32], for example, have

explored such an approach and found excellent agreement for the “transverse cooling” of a

wavepacket exiting an abruptly terminating transverse potential (when quantum reﬂections

do not play a role).

In our calculations, remarkable agreement is seen between the “transverse heating” for the

quantum wavepacket and for its Ehrenfest trajectory, when wavepacket properties such as

dispersion can be neglected (in accordance with our approximation to Ehrenfest’s theorem)

and where large quantum numbers are involved (in accordance with Bohr’s correspondence

principle). It will also be seen that the transverse heating of the Ehrenfest trajectories and

the wavepackets are in disagreement with analytic expressions obtained by Blanchard and

Zozulya for high-velocity atoms and large radii bends [33]. The present results provide guid-

ance as to when matter wave propagation through microstructures can be reliably considered

using classical particle motion.

II. DETAILS OF THE CALCULATIONS

Whilst there are a variety of atom chip wire conﬁgurations both proposed and experi-

mentally proven [4, 34], the same theoretical ansatz found in [26] was adopted here. That is,

only multiple wire conﬁgurations that do not require external bias ﬁelds applied in the plane

3

of the microchip surface are considered [30]. The problems relating to Majorana spin-ﬂips

during propagation in the zero-ﬁeld region of such geometries are ignored here, although it

is noted that Luo et.al. [30] have proposed a rotating potential scheme to avoid these losses.

Our model reduces exactly to a 2-D geometry without losing any physics, as the out-of-

plane potential remains constant through the bend in the limit where atom-atom interactions

are neglected (in other words, the out-of-plane quantum number is conserved [26]).

In

practice, guiding potentials are quadratic near their minima, so a simple harmonic oscillator

(SHO) potential is employed here:

The time-propagation calculations are performed using a split-operator Crank-Nicolson

method with ﬁnite diﬀerences on a non-uniform, non-Cartesian grid. The details of our

implementation of the diﬀerencing are discussed in Appendix A (see also Ref. [35]), but we

will outline the time propagation scheme below.

We ﬁrst note that we use a hybrid (Cartesian plus polar) grid to improve the eﬃciency

and accuracy of the calculations. A purely Cartesian grid is, in general, computationally

wasteful for bends with angles other than 0◦, so uniform Cartesian grids in the leads are

joined with a uniform polar grid in the bend. Higher accuracy is possible by using the

coordinate system best adapted to each region. The same non-uniform transverse grid is

used in both the leads and the bend, with the density of grid points greatest at ρ0, the center
of the potential valley. An example grid is shown in Fig. 2 plotted as a function of z′, which

is an auxillary coordinate that measures the distance along the guide from the middle of the

bend (z′ = 0 at φ = φ0/2). This scheme minimises the number of gridpoints required for

long propagation times through arbitrary angle bends. In this transformed grid, 2Nz plus

(a) shows the grid points

translated to a Cartesian coordinate system. (b) shows the grid points used in the calculations:

where the coordinate transverse to the direction of propagation in both the leads and bend is given

by x, while z′ is an auxillary coordinate that measures the distance from the middle of the bend

(z′ = 0 at φ = φ0/2) along an equipotential line. The grid points located within the bend are

connected with the dashed lines for clarity.

Nφ gridpoints are along the direction of propagation, and the grid spacing δz and ρ0δφ are

chosen to be roughly the same. The signiﬁcant computational beneﬁt of using the hybrid

grid was that calculations of bends with large radii require essentially the same number of

transverse grid points Nx as smaller bends. There is a small error introduced where the

Cartesian and polar grids are joined since the diﬀerencing there assumes the grid lines are

parallel. This error decreases with increasingly dense grids and with growing ρ0.

The time-dependent solution of the Schr¨odinger equation is

Ψ(x, z, t + δt) = e−iHδtΨ(x, z, t) .

One way to evaluate the exponential operator is to write H = T + V and use the standard

split operator idea to write

e−iHδt = e− i

The exponentials of the potential are straightforward since the potential matrix is diagonal,

and e−iT δt = e−iTxδte−iTzδt in the leads since [Tx, Tz] = 0. In the bend, [Tρ, Tφ]

The kinetic energy operators are evaluated as described in Appendix A and give tridi-

agonal matrices. Exponentiating these operators is accomplished with the Crank-Nicolson

method. The time evolution is thus performed in each spatial direction separately by solv-

ing complex tri-diagonal linear equations. Each timestep requires solving a linear equation

equations for the x-direction.

We only consider states that are in the lowest mode of the lead (x0 = ρ0 and ∆x = 1).

Despite a dense transverse grid, the above analytic ground state is not exactly an eigenstate

on the grid, so the normalization constant N0 is determined numerically from a midpoint

integration rule (see Appendix A). The split operator Crank-Nicolson scheme guarantees the

unitarity of the wavefunction for all later times. Cigar-shaped wavepackets were employed

here (∆z = 10), which corresponds to the common experimental situation in which a BEC is

prepared with transverse trapping frequencies that are signiﬁcantly larger than the frequency

in the direction of propagation [12, 36, 37]. They are also used since an elongated Gaussian

wavepacket has a small velocity spread (in oscillator units ∆z∆vz = 1), reducing the eﬀects of

wavepacket dispersion. The numerical grid is large enough that the wavepacket propagates

through the bend without touching the edges of the grid during the times of interest.

Expectation values were determined using a midpoint rule integration (see Appendix

A). In particular,

variation remained at levels less than 1 part in 108. To achieve such accuracy, a typical

calculation (90◦ bend with ρ0 = 10, using a wavepacket with vz = 3, ∆z = 10 starting

at z0 =

200) required δt = 0.005. We used Nz = 8000 covering

400 < z < 0, giving

−

−

tens of points per wavelength (determined from the λ = 2π/vz). In the bend, Nφ = 314

points were chosen to ensure a uniform spacing along the SHO minimum in both the bend

and leads. The transverse grid ensured that the oscillations of the maximum SHO mode

energetically available (and a few of the closed, evanescent modes closest to threshold [26])

could be accurately described (eg. Nx = 248 was suﬃcient for vz = 3).

To quantitatively compare the Ehrenfest trajectory and quantum mechanical wavepacket

calculations, the transverse heating Eh is used [33]. The transverse heating measures the

amount of propagation energy (Ez) transferred into transverse energy by the bend, eg. for

the Ehrenfest trajectory we used

If there is no transverse energy initially — as we assume in the present calculations — Eh

must be non-negative and there can be no transverse cooling. Quantum mechanically, we

determined the transverse heating of a wavepacket that has been excited by the bend from

the time-averages of

T

(t) and

V

(t) once the wavepacket had completely exited the bend.

Further discussion of this is relegated to Appendix B.

III. RESULTS

In this section we will ﬁrst discuss a series of φ0 = 90◦ bends with various radii ρ0 to

highlight the quantum mechanical wavepacket and Ehrenfest trajectories. We will then

examine the transverse heating of both wavepackets and Ehrenfest trajectories propagating

through the same bend, and compare these results with the analytic classical results of

Blanchard and Zozulya [33]. The emphasis of the present calculations is on parameters close

to currently realisable experimental situations, i.e. larger radii bends and higher propagation

energies.

A. Wavepacket and Ehrenfest trajectories

The calculations in this section are presented to provide an understanding of the funda-

mental wavepacket and Ehrenfest trajectory dynamics. To demonstrate multimode excita-

tion, an incoming wavepacket with vz = 3 was chosen. At this energy, four excited modes

are energetically open. The excitation of a wavepacket during propagation through three

8

diﬀerent 90◦ bends (ρ0 = 15, 25, 35) can be observed in Fig. 3, which shows the probability

superimposed on its Ehrenfest trajectory (dashed line).

The tightest of the three bends yields signiﬁcant population of all ﬁve available modes

in the ﬁnal snapshot. Due to energy conservation, the conversion of longitudinal kinetic

energy into transverse energy (heating) means that each excited mode has a diﬀerent average

propagation velocity. Consequently, the higher modes lag further and further behind the

ground mode as time progresses. This eﬀect can be seen in the ﬁnal snapshots in Fig. 3,

where the excited modes are showing the ﬁrst signs of separating from the ground state. It

should be emphasized that the number of modes available is the same for all ρ0 shown in

Fig. 3. The degree of mode-excitation, however, depends on ρ0. The two main conclusions

of our time-independent calculations for circular waveguide bends [26] are also bourne out

here. That is, in general, there is minimal reﬂection from circular bends, and mode transfer

can become signiﬁcant for tight bends.

9

To determine the suitability of classical mechanics for this problem, we invoke Ehrenfest’s

theorem within the approximation shown in Eq. (1). Given the exact agreement between

quantum and classical mechanics Ehrenfest’s theorem usually gives for SHOs, it might well

be expected that this approach would be suﬃcient for the present problem [38]. Ehrenfest’s

theorem requires that we solve the classical equations of motion with initial conditions

matching the expectation values of position and velocity for the corresponding wavepacket.

We thus need only consider a single classical trajectory for each wavepacket, the Ehrenfest

trajectory. For the present initial wavepacket (∆x = 1, ∆z = 10, vz = 3, x0 = ρ0, z0 =
200), the trajectory begins at x0 = ρ0, z0 ≤
0 with vz = 3, vx = 0 and the resulting

The Ehrenfest trajectory always maintains ρ(t)

ρ0 in the bend, even though the SHO

≥

minimum is at ρ0. This behavior is due to the conversion of linear momentum into angular

momentum ℓy = vzρ0 in the bend, which results in an eﬀective transverse potential,

Vef f (ρ) =

Since the Ehrenfest trajectory enters with zero transverse kinetic energy, this potential has

10

an inner turning point at ρ = ρ0 (from Vef f = Ez = v2

z /2), and an outer turning point
0 ) for large ρ0. Thus, the Ehrenfest trajectory always exits a

(ρ−2

at ρ = ρ0 + 4Ez/ρ0 +

circular bend with ρ

ρ0, and the outer turning point approaches ρ = ρ0 for large ρ0.

O

≥

In general, this means that the amount of propagation energy transferred into transverse

energy decreases with increasing ρ0.

In the quantum mechanical situation, the eﬀect of the centrifugal barrier is manifested

in the transverse eigenmodes within the bend: they slosh outwards with increasing energy

[26]. Nevertheless, the path of a wavepacket’s average position is such that it always lies

at

(t)

ρ
i

≤

∼

ρ0. This diﬀerence from classical mechanics stems from using an elongated

initial wavepacket. For the smallest bends, the wavepacket is comparable to the bend length

(∆z(t)

ρ0φ0), and the diﬀerence is most exaggerated. As ρ0 increases, with everything

else held ﬁxed, the Ehrenfest trajectories and the path of the wavepacket’s average position

do approach one another at ρ = ρ0 (particularly obvious in the top-right corner of Fig. 4 in

the ρ0 = 60 and 70 calculations).

We can see that Ehrenfest’s theorem does not give the agreement that one might ex-

pect for a SHO. This discrepancy can be understood by examining Eq. (1). For a SHO,

∂V /∂x
i

is exact. A single classical trajectory will thus exactly reproduce the quantum wavepacket’s

expectation values. In the present case, however, we get no such simple relation because of

the bend, and must approximate

∂V (x, z)/∂x

. This approxima-

tion makes Ehrenfest’s theorem tractable, but also leads to its eventual breakdown. Without

this approximation, Ehrenfest’s theorem would be exact for all bend parameters.

Despite the discrepancy between the quantum and classical paths, a feature of these

systems is best illustrated in the ρ0 = 15 inset of Fig. 3, where the probability density of

the wavepacket is superimposed on its Ehrenfest trajectory. This shows that, in the tight

bend limit, the wriggles of a wavepacket exiting the bend do follow its Ehrenfest trajectory.

The wavepacket wriggles are due to a superposition of transverse modes (see Appendix

B) and, in some sense, the wriggles form the wavepacket’s “trajectory” as they are the

path of maximum wavefunction ﬂux. To further compare and contrast a wavepacket and

its Ehrenfest trajectory, we next examine the amount of transverse heating by a series of

circular bends.

11

B. Transverse Heating

The transverse heating is an experimental observable. It has been measured, for example,

for a beam of cold atoms propagating through multiple circular bends [28]. Theoretically,

transverse heating created by curved waveguides was investigated by Blanchard and Zozulya

(BZ) [33] from a purely classical point of view. They found that transverse heating, Eq. (7),

of an ensemble of classical particles on average always occurs as they propagate through

a bend, and derived two formulas for the average transverse heating induced by a circular

bend (shown in S.I. units for later comparison):

. The calculations

shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are included, along with additional calculations to bring out the

dependence on ρ0. There is extremely good agreement between the wavepacket and the

corresponding Ehrenfest trajectory at small ρ0, while the present results disagree with both

of the BZ formulas over the entire range of ρ0.

Quantum mechanically, the transverse heating of a wavepacket, i.e. mode-transfer, is

due to the matching between the lead and bend [26] and is manifested as the excitations

seen in Fig. 3. The excitation and interference of the various modes was studied in [26] as

a function of ρ0, φ0 and vz, and is not examined here in any detail. Despite the complexity

in the quantum heating mechanism, there is close agreement between the wavepacket and

Ehrenfest trajectory results for small ρ0 in Fig. 5. The small ρ0 limit is further investigated

below as a function of vz.

At the core, the physics of transverse heating for the Ehrenfest trajectory can be un-

derstood in terms of the number of transverse oscillations that occur during propagation

through the bend. Consider a harmonic approximation to the eﬀective bend potential of

maxima are ρ0 = 12 apart, starting at ρ0 = 6. The transverse

heating is minimized for ρ0φ0/(2vz)

nπ, where the trajectory exits the bend at ρ(τ ) = ρ0.

Of course, at x = ρ0 in the exit lead there is no force acting on the Ehrenfest trajectory,

and thus no transverse heating. The EH.A.

transverse heating minima in Fig. 5 occur every

≈

h

multiple of ρ0 = 12 for large ρ0, with a slight departure for the two minima located near
ρ0 ≈

23 and 10 due to the corrective term in Eq. (13).

There are two complicating factors hidden amongst the quantum and Ehrenfest compar-

isons: dispersion and mode-excitation. Dispersion is manifested in the wavepacket calcula-

tions as a dampening of the oscillations of Eh with ρ0 compared to the Ehrenfest trajectory

results. Mode-excitation also complicates the comparison since each mode that is excited

upon entering the bend executes a diﬀerent number of transverse oscillations through the

bend. For vz = 3, both of these velocity eﬀects are not so signiﬁcant for small ρ0, but

begin to play a role at larger ρ0. While Ehrenfest’s theorem is exact, the present results

demonstrate that the approximation of Eq. (1) begins to breakdown in the large ρ0 regime,

where wave eﬀects such as dispersion become signiﬁcant.

The variance of the BZ results with the Ehrenfest trajectory calculations is seen in com-

paring Eq. (13) with Eq. (9). This clearly shows a factor of 2 diﬀerence in the sinusoidal

periodicity (apart from an additional corrective term), with the

formula predicting

transverse heating minima at every multiple of ρ0 = 6 (for 90◦ bends with ﬁxed vz = 3).

EBZ1

i

To understand the diﬀerence in the periodicity, consider a single classical particle entering

at the center of the bend with non-zero transverse velocity: this particle will pass through

ρ = ρ0 twice as it oscillates through one period of the eﬀective potential, Eq. (8). If the exit

point out of the bend occurs at ρ(τ ) = ρ0, the particle exits with the same transverse speed

that it entered with. This means that no transverse heating of the classical particle occurs

for two points during one oscillation in the eﬀective bend potential. In the gentle bend limit,

the heating minima would indeed occur every ρ0 = 6. On the other hand, the Ehrenfest

trajectory, which strictly maintains ρ(t)

ρ0 throughout the bend, requires one complete

≥

14

oscillation in the bend potential to reach back to ρ(t) = ρ0, (and thus heating minima occur

every ρ0 = 12 in the large ρ0 limit).

The comparison of the BZ results with the quantum wavepacket calculations seen in Fig. 5

also warrants further comment. The transverse heating minima for quantum wavepackets

drift away from the Ehrenfest trajectory minima as ρ0 becomes large in Fig. 5. In this limit, it

might be expected that the ”gentle bend” assumption leading to Eq. (9) is better satisﬁed.

We do not, however, observe the appearance of two minima in the quantum wavepacket

calculations as per

. The BZ formulae are based on an analysis of an ensemble of

classical particles that enter relatively gentle bends with transverse velocities much smaller

than the propagation velocity. To examine the gentle bend, high velocity wavepacket limit is

not only computationally taxing, but remains beyond the scope of the present paper. While

the present quantum results do not agree with either of Blanchard and Zozulya’s formulae,

it must be emphasized that the magnitude of the ﬁve diﬀerent results shown in Fig. 5 all
follow the same decay trend: Eh ∝

is striking correspondence between the transverse heating of the quantum wavepackets and

15

Ehrenfest trajectories for vz > 2, even up to the highest energy, vz = 8, where the quantum

calculation has 32 energetically open modes. This agreement follows one of the fundamental

postulates of quantum mechanics, Bohr’s correspondence principle, which states that in the

limit of high quantum number, the quantum and the classical pictures merge. This is well

known for a 1-D SHO, and it is nice to see that it applies to the present potentials. The

correspondence is completely lacking, of course, at low-energies since only small quantum

numbers are allowed. In particular, no transverse heating of the wavepacket is allowed for
vz ≤

√2 since only the ground state mode is accessible.

On the basis of the harmonic approximation in Eq. (13), the Eh minima for ρ0 = 10 occur

at vz = 2.5, 1.25, etc. The Ehrenfest trajectory calculations deviate from this periodicity

as vz increases, since it is a tight bend in which there is a signiﬁcant perturbation of the

eﬀective bend potential of Eq. (8) due to the centripetal term. The BZ formula Eq. (9)

predicts additional minima at vz = 5, 5/3, etc, and Fig. 6 shows a complete departure of the

BZ predictions from the quantum and Ehrenfest results across the entire range of vz. This

is not unexpected since it was already seen in the vz = 3, tight ρ0 limit in Fig. 5.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation has been solved for non-interacting, low-energy

wavepackets propagating through circular bends. Our main goal for the present time-

dependent calculations was to understand the conditions under which the classical picture

of atom propagation through microstructures is valid for predicting transverse excitation.

To this end, a series of time-dependent quantum and Ehrenfest trajectory calculations were

performed and compared.

In the tight-bend limit, ρ0 ≤

30, for vz = 3 there was good agreement between the

transverse heating predicted by the wavepacket and the Ehrenfest trajectory calculations.

In contrast to the purely SHO case, the path of the wavepacket averages

x
i

(t),
h

h

z

i

(t) through

the bend were found to be completely diﬀerent from the Ehrenfest trajectory for small ρ0.

The peak probability density of the wavepacket, however, wriggles out of the bend along the

same path as the Ehrenfest trajectory. Bohr’s correspondence principle is demonstrated in

the tight-bend, high propagation velocity limit (where high-n modes can be excited) where

great agreement is seen between the transverse heating of the wavepacket and its Ehrenfest

16

trajectory.

The agreement for larger ρ0 was not as good due to the increasingly important eﬀects of

wavepacket dispersion. In general, as long as the propagation velocity is such that there are

minimal wave eﬀects (such as reﬂection and dispersion) the approximation to Ehrenfest’s

theorem introduced in Eq. (1) provides a useful approximation to the exact Ehrenfest’s

theorem and thus the quantum mechanics.

A note of caution should be added when extending this idea to other microstructures.

For example, a wavepacket exiting an abruptly terminating transverse potential can trans-

fer transverse energy into longitudinal energy, leading to transverse cooling [32]. In that

particular study, an ensemble of classical particles was found to reproduce the wavepacket

expectation values (given situations where quantum reﬂections did not play a role). The

Ehrenfest trajectory through such a potential, however, would be completely unaﬀected by

the changes in the transverse potentials.

As the temperature of the atoms used in atom chip experiments decreases, the modelling

of experiments using Monte-Carlo simulations will increasingly need to take into account the

wave nature of the atoms. The present calculations provide guidance as to when this can

simply be achieved by using a single classical trajectory to calculate the quantum observables

of waves propagating through simple microstructures.

APPENDIX A: FINITE DIFFERENCING

Most implementations of ﬁnite diﬀerences for the Schr¨odinger equation implicitly require a

volume element that is constant over the whole space. This condition is trivially satisﬁed for

Cartesian coordinates and can usually be achieved through a rescaling of the wave function

for other coordinate systems. Spherical coordinates are a prime example of the latter case

since the radial wave function is often scaled by a factor of r to remove the ﬁrst derivative

from the kinetic energy, eﬀectively putting the system into a Cartesian coordinate system

17

with a boundary condition.

Another common coordinate system, cylindrical coordinates, is not so easily handled —

rescaling the wave function involves a factor of √ρ. The overall behavior of the wave function

near ρ=0 is then non-analytic, making ﬁnite diﬀerencing invalid since diﬀerencing relies on

Taylor series expansions. Further, straightforward diﬀerencing of the unscaled ρ equation

gives a non-Hermitian operator, which is a situation to be avoided in general. The angular

momentum operator in spherical coordinates suﬀers from similar problems upon rescaling.

Somewhat ad hoc schemes have been formulated to deal with these problems, but are less

than satisfactory from the viewpoint of wanting a general diﬀerencing scheme applicable to

arbitrary coordinate systems.

One solution to this problem has actually been known for quite some time, and is based

on general principles of discrete calculus and diﬀerencing [39]. Our approach is similar to

Ref. [35], however, and applies the more familiar variational principle to derive the diﬀer-

encing equations. The derivation will be outlined for the one-dimensional time-independent

equation for simplicity, but carries through in exactly the same way for the multi-dimensional

time-dependent equation. We begin with the energy functional

Note that in writing the kinetic energy as we have will guarantee that our resulting diﬀerence

representation is Hermitian. To proceed, we must choose quadrature and diﬀerencing rules

for the integrals and derivatives, respectively. We choose the midpoint rule

H ~ψ = ES ~ψ ,

shows that our diﬀerencing scheme does indeed yield Hermitian operators. The Hamiltonian

matrix is tridiagonal just as for the usual second-order ﬁnite diﬀerencing of the Schr¨odinger

equation; the overlap matrix S is diagonal.

This diﬀerence scheme must be supplemented by boundary conditions. If the wave func-

tion is to be zero on the boundary, then ψ0 (or ψN +1) must be set to zero. If the derivative

of the wave function is to be zero, then two grid points should be chosen to straddle the

boundary point and the condition ψ0=ψ1 imposed (or ψN =ψN +1). This condition requires

that

the last element to apply the boundary condition at the other boundary. The case in which

no boundary condition is required — if ρ=0 — is treated the same as the zero derivative

boundary condition. In all cases, the values of ρi outside of the grid should be chosen to be

symmetric with respect to the boundary.

This equation can be put in somewhat more convenient form using the usual transforma-

which is always possible for positive deﬁnite matrices S. In this case, the result is trivial

since S is diagonal:

superposition of such states, both the time and spatial dependence of the expectation values

is not so simple and is worth this brief appendix.

In our analysis, the transverse heating played the critical role in our comparisons between

the quantal and classical results. The transverse heating is simply the energy transferred

from the wavepackets longitudinal kinetic energy into transverse energy. Quantum mechan-

ically, of course, we must take the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator. One

might be tempted to use the virial theorem to more simply calculate this using twice the ex-

pectation value of the potential energy, however, it is well known [40] that the virial theorem

only strictly holds for stationary states.

It turns out that for a simple harmonic oscillator in one dimension that the expectation

value of the kinetic energy for an arbitrary state is

only the time-average will usually be important, this result can be handy for numerical

calculations. Note that if only states with opposite parity or indices separated by more than

two are populated, then the virial theorem holds for all times.

For waveguide applications such as those considered in this paper, it is convenient to

write the wave function as

Ψ(x, z, t) =

ψn(z, t)ϕn(x)e−iEnt

(B3)

where ϕn(x) is the transverse SHO wave function. This multi-moded wavepacket can then

be used to calculate observables. For instance, the transverse kinetic energy is

So, as long as the components ψn overlap, they can interfere, leading to time-varying ob-

mode conversion — the observables will become time-independent as expected.

We can also use these ideas to interpret the wave function at a ﬁxed time by only inte-

Fig. 7 shows the average potential energy of wavepackets initially in the ground state of

the SHO with varying incident velocity vz as they propagate through a 90◦ circular bend

of radius ρ0 = 10. As the wavepacket is sloshing around in the bend, the potential energy

increases and settles into an oscillation between kinetic and potential energies in the exit

lead. As t

, the components ψn of the wavepacket will no longer overlap [see Eqs. (B4)

and (B5)]. Thus, the expectation values will no longer oscillate, and the oscillations seen in

Fig. 7 will dampen with time towards half of the total transverse energy. For the calculations

seen here, this would involve propagating the wavepackets to stupidly large distances down

the exit lead. Instead, to determine the transverse heating, we used averages of

i
over one oscillation once the wavepacket has completely exited the bend, i.e. the kinetic
iavg, and the transverse

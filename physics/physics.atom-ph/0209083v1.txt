Abstract

Recent Feshbach-resonance experiments with 85Rb Bose-Einstein condensates have led to
a host of unexplained results: dramatic losses of condensate atoms for an across-resonance
sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld, a collapsing condensate with a burst of atoms emanating from
the remnant condensate, increased losses for decreasing interaction times—until very short
times are reached, and coherent oscillations between remnant and burst atoms. In particular,
the amplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing atoms, have
prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate. Using a minimal mean-
ﬁeld model, we ﬁnd that rogue dissociation, molecular dissociation to noncondensate atom
pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the physical mechanism responsible for these observations,
although very little molecular condensate is formed. Reﬁning the model provides excellent
quantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and the fraction of
molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured atom loss.

Introduction

The process known as the Feshbach resonance [1] occurs when two ultracold atoms collide in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, whereby a spin ﬂip of one atom can induce the pair to jump
from the two-atom continuum to a quasibound molecular state. If the initial atoms are Bose
condensed [2], the so-formed molecules will also comprise a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
[3]. Since the Feshbach resonance is mathematically identical to photoassociation [4, 5, 6],
the process that occurs when two ultracold atoms form a molecule by absorbing a photon,
insight gathered in either case is applicable to the other. In particular, the most recent results
from photoassociation predict that rogue dissociation, molecular dissociation to nonconden-
sate atom pairs, imposes a maximum achievable rate on atom-molecule conversion, as well as
the possibility of coherent Rabi oscillations between the BEC and dissociated atom pairs [7].
Initial Feshbach resonance experiments in 85Rb [8] were motivated by the possibility [9] of
enabling Bose condensation by tuning the natively negative atom-atom scattering length into
the positive regime. As part of the experiment that achieved condensation [10], the magnetic
80%
ﬁeld was swept across the Feshbach resonance, resulting in heavy condensate losses (

for the slowest sweep rates). Additional experiments led to the observation of collapsing
condensates, an event characterized by bursts of atoms emanating from a remnant BEC, and
coined ”bosenova” for the analogy with a supernova explosion [11]. More recently, experi-
ments with pulsed magnetic ﬁelds that come close to, but do not cross, the Feshbach-resonance
have revealed a striking increase in condensate loss for a decrease in the interaction time– until
reaching very short times [12]. Finally, double-pulse results indicate large amplitude (
25%)
10%) prompting speculation on the
remnant-burst oscillations, with the missing atoms (
formation of a molecular condensate [13].

In the mean time, work on Feshbach-stimulated photoproduction of stable molecular con-
densates indicates that rogue dissociation dominates atom-molecule conversion for the above
85Rb Feshbach resonance, meaning that the production of a signiﬁcant fraction of molecular
BEC is not to be expected [14]. Additionally, we ﬁnd intriguing the assertions of a break-
down of mean-ﬁeld theory in the face of large resonance-induced scattering lengths [10, 12],
especially given that theory actually faults the effective all-atom description [15]. We have
therefore tested a mean-ﬁeld model of coherent atom-molecule conversion against the salient
features of the JILA experiments [16], and the subsequent understanding is presented in this
Contribution (for related work, see Refs. [17, 18]).

Mean-ﬁeld theory and its validity

The mathematical equivalence of the Feshbach-resonance [3] and photoassociation [4, 5] lies
in both processes being described, in terms of second quantization, as destroying two atoms
and creating a molecule. We therefore model a quantum degenerate gas of atoms coupled via
a Feshbach resonance to a condensate of quasibound molecules based on Refs. [5, 6, 7]. The
initial atoms are denoted by the boson ﬁeld φ(r, t), and the quasibound molecules by the ﬁeld
ψ(r, t). The Hamiltonian density for this system is

where m = 2µ is the mass of an atom, ~δ0 is the energy difference between a molecule and
two atoms, a is the off-resonant s-wave scattering length, ρ is an invariant density equal to the
sum of atom density and twice the molecular density, and Γ(ǫ) is the dissociation rate for a
molecule with the energy ~ǫ above the threshold of the Feshbach resonance.

To address the validity of mean-ﬁeld theory for near-resonant systems, we ﬁnd the Heisen-
berg equation of motion for the molecular operator and solve it in the adiabatic limit: ψ =
[Ω/(2δ0√ρ)] φφ . Pluging this back into Eq. (1.1), gives

The detuning can of course written in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld by introducing the difference
in the magnetic moments of the resonant states ∆µ : ~δ0 = ∆µ(B

The effective scattering length (1.4), was obtained by adiabatically eliminating the molec-
2π~a/m, Ω. Since the adiabatic approximation fails for
ular ﬁeld, i.e., by assuming δ0
B0), it is therefore the effective all-atom description that actually breaks
δ0
down when resonance is encountered [15], not mean-ﬁeld theory. The validity of the mean
ﬁeld approximation is determined by ρ
1, which holds independent of the value of the
magnetic ﬁeld. Including the molecular condensate dynamics provides a complete mean-ﬁeld
description of the near-resonant system.

That said, we expect the mean-ﬁeld equations arising from the Hamiltonian (1.1) to suit-
ably model the salient features of the JILA experiments. Switching to momentum space,
only zero-momentum atomic and molecular condensate modes are retained, represented by
the respective c-number amplitudes α and β. We also take into account correlated pairs of
noncondensate atoms using a complex amplitude C(ǫ), which represent pairs of noncon-
, with ~ǫ
densate atoms in the manner of the Heisenberg picture expectation value

son operators under the simplifying assumption that the noncondensate atoms pairs are only
allowed to couple back to the molecular condensate, ignoring the possibility that noncon-
densate atoms associate to make noncondensate molecules. This neglect is justiﬁed to the
extent that Bose enhancement favors transitions back to the molecular condensate. The ﬁnal
mean-ﬁeld equations are [7]

The analog of the Rabi frequency for the rogue modes ξ is inferred using Fermi Golden rule,
which gives the dissociation rate for a positive-energy molecule as Γ(ǫ) = √ǫ ξ2 .

Next the problem is reformulated in terms of two key parameters with the dimension of
frequency. The density-dependent frequency ωρ = ~ρ2/3/m, has been identiﬁed before,
along with the operational signiﬁcance that, once Ω >
∼ ωρ, rogue dissociation is expected
to be a dominant factor in the dynamics [5, 6, 7]. Here it is convenient to deﬁne another
primary parameter with the dimension of frequency. Considering on-shell dissociation of
molecules to atoms with the relative energy ǫ, the Wigner threshold law delivers a dissociation
0; hence, we deﬁne 4Ξ =
rate Γ(ǫ) such that Γ(ǫ)/√ǫ converges to a ﬁnite limit for ǫ

Lastly, when the coupling to the continuum of noncondensate atom pairs is included, the
continuum shifts the molecular state [19]. We have, of course, taken the dominant state push-
ing, and the related renormalization effects, into account in our calculations [16, 20]. Sufﬁce it
to say that we choose the bare detuning δ0 so that the renormalized detuning attains the desired

ing detunings δ, the interactions energies between the atoms due to the background scattering
length a = 23.8 nm are immaterial. We therefore ignore atom-atom interactions unrelated
to the Feshbach resonance, as well as the (unknown) atom-molecule and molecule-molecule
interactions.

Results

We begin with the experiments [10] implementing a sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld across the
Feshbach resonance, which are of course a version of the Landau-Zener problem [5, 6, 22].
Although a sweep of the detuning δ from above to below threshold at a rate slow compared to
the condensate coupling Ω will move the system adiabatically from all atoms to all molecules,
rogue dissociation will overtake coherent atom-molecule conversion when Ω >
∼ ωρ [5, 6, 7].
Nevermind that the JILA experiments sweep from below to above threshold, for a density
250 ωρ, and so rogue
ρ = 1
dissociation should seriously dominate. This is indeed the case (see Fig. 1.1). Apparently,
coherent conversion occurs not between atomic and molecular BEC, but between atomic BEC
and dissociated atom pairs. Holding this thought, we conclude that mean-ﬁeld theory indicates
rogue dissociation as a primary sink of atoms in the Ref. [10] sweeps across the resonance.

Next we consider the experiments [12] for which nontrivial electromagnetic coil technol-
ogy was developed to create trapezoidal magnetic ﬁeld pulses that bring the system near–
but not across– resonance, hold for a given amount of time, and return to the original ﬁeld
value. Neglecting the burst, these remnant-focused experiments revealed a contradiction with
the conventional understanding of condensate loss: rather than a loss that increased monoton-
ically with increasing interaction time, the results indicated a loss that increased with decreas-
ing interaction time, until very short times were reached. The present mean-ﬁeld approach
works similarly, as shown in Fig. 1.2. Our interpretation is that adiabaticity is again at play.
At very short pulse durations, increasing interaction time leads to increasing condensate loss,
as expected. In contrast, as the time dependence of the pulse gets slower, the system eventu-
ally follows the pulse adiabatically, and returns close to the initial condensate state when the
pulse has passed.

5

∼

Finally, we turn to the experiments [13] in which two trapezoidal pulses were applied
to a 85Rb condensate, and the fraction of remnant and burst atoms measured for a vari-
able between-pulse time and magnetic-ﬁeld amplitude. These experiments revealed coher-
ent remnant-burst oscillations with amplitudes of up to
25%. As it happens, we have
recently predicted coherent oscillations between atoms and dissociated atom pairs in a rogue-
dominated system, although we harbored doubts regarding any practical realization [7]. Cast-
ing these doubts aside, we consider a time dependent detuning (magnetic ﬁeld) similar to
Fig. 2 of Ref. [13] [Fig. 1.3(a)], and determine the fraction of remnant condensate atoms,
noncondensate atoms, and molecules at the end of the pulse sequence as a function of the
holding time between the two pulses [Fig. 1.3(b)]. Oscillations are seen with the amplitude of
about 15% between condensate and noncondensate atoms at the frequency of the molecular
state corresponding to the magnetic ﬁeld during the holding period. The molecular fraction
appears too small to account for the amplitude of the oscillations. In fact, what we termed
molecular frequency is the characteristic frequency of a coherent superposition of molecules
and noncondensate atom pair. Here the oscillations, directly comparable to Fig. 4(a) in Ref.
[13], are Ramsey fringes [23] in the evolution between an atomic condensate and a molecular
condensate dressed with noncondensate atom pairs.

Although our rogue-dissociation ideas provide a neat qualitative explanation for the three
experiments we have discussed1, in all fairness it must be noted that we have fallen short
of a full quantitative agreement. We have therefore reﬁned our renormalization techniques,
extended our model to allow for Bose enhancement of the rogue modes, and included an
average over a Gaussian distribution of densities [20]. So far, we have only applied this full
model to the double-pulse experiments [13], the results of which are shown in Fig. 1.4. Not
only do we ﬁnd excellent agreement on the size of the experimental Ramsey fringes, but the
fraction of molecular condensate (
5%) is now sufﬁcient to explain the observed atom loss
[8(3)%].

∼

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a minimal mean-ﬁeld model is sufﬁcient to quali-
tatively explain a number of puzzling results in Feshbach-resonant systems [16]. Moreover,
our reﬁned model [20] gives near-perfect quantitative agreement with the double-pulse exper-
iments [13], leaving little-to-no room for additional loss mechanisms. Collapsing-condensate
physics is therefore understood as a matter of rogue dissociation, which leads to strong losses
in the threshold neighborhood, decreased remnant fraction for decreasing interaction time—
until very short times are reached, and coherent remnant-burst oscillations. Ironically, the
Feshbach resonance has led to a regime dominated by rogue dissociation, which apparently
tends to counteract the production of a molecular condensate.

1If an explanation in terms of below-threshold molecular dissociation seems a bit odd, consider that energy need

not be conserved for transient processes where a time dependence is externally imposed on the system.

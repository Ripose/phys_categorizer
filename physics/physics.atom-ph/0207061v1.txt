The transformation introduced by Giusti-Suzor and Fano and extended by Lecomte and Ueda for
the study of resonance structures in the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) is used to
reformulate MQDT into the forms having one-to-one correspondence with those in Fano’s conﬁgu-
ration mixing (CM) theory of resonance for the photofragmentation processes involving one closed
and many open channels. The reformulation thus allows MQDT to have the full power of the CM
theory, still keeping its own strengths such as the fundamental description of resonance phenomena
without an assumption of the presence of a discrete state as in CM.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Though multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT)
is a powerful theory of resonance capable of describing
complex spectra including both bound and continuum
regions with only a few parameters, resonance structures
are not transparently identiﬁed in its formulation because
of the indirect treatment of resonance[1, 2]. In order to
identify resonance terms, one needs a special treatment
like the one Giusti-Suzor and Fano introduced for the
two channel case[3]. They noticed that the usual Lu-
Fano plot often obscures symmetry apparent in its ex-
tended version. The symmetry can be brought out in
the MQDT formulation by shifting the origin of the plot
to the center of symmetry using the phase-shifted base
pairs ﬁrst considered in Ref. [4]:

(f, g) → (f cos πµ − g sin πµ, g cos πµ + f sin πµ).

(1)

By this phase renormalization, the diagonal elements of
short-range reactance matrices K can be made zero so
that resonance structures are separated from the back-
ground ones in two channel processes (Dubau and Seaton
also obtained the same results as Giusti-Suzor and Fano’s
ones from a diﬀerent approach[5]).

Generalizations of

their method to the case in-
volving more than two channels have been done by
Cooke and Cromer[6], Lecomte[7], Ueda[8], Giusti-Suzor
and Lefebvre-Brion[9], Wintgen and Fridrich[10], and
Cohen[11]. Lecomte and Ueda showed that, for such
a general case, making the diagonal elements of reac-
tance matrices zero can only be achieved with an addi-
tional orthogonal transformation of basis functions be-
sides the phase renormalization[12]. Using this trans-
formation, Lecomte derived the best parameters for the

∗Electronic address: clee@madang.ajou.ac.kr

description of total autoionization cross-sections shorn of
the background part for the most general case involving
many open and many closed channels. Ueda derived to-
tal cross-section formulas analogous to Fano’s resonance
formula for several cases including one closed and many
open channels. Giusti-Suzor and Lefebvre-Brion[9], and
Wintgen and Friedrich[10] did the detailed studies for the
case of two closed and one open channels and Cohen[11]
involving two closed and two open channels.

One drawback of the above-mentioned work is that
partial cross-section formulas for photofragmentation
processes were not dealt with. Recently, Lee[13] and
Lee and Kim[14] derived the MQDT formulation which
yielded the partial cross-section formulas analogous to
Fano’s resonance formula and obtained the complete rela-
tion between MQDT and the conﬁguration mixing (CM)
formulas[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. But their work was
restricted to the case involving only two open and one
closed channels. This paper extends their work to the
case involving many open channels and has succeeded in
obtaining the same degree of results as the previous ones.
Section 2 describes the reformulation. Section 3 derives
the photofragmentation cross-sections. Finally, Section 4
gives the summary and discussion.

II. REFORMULATION

In the multichannel quantum defect

theory of
photofragmentation process, the coordinate R for a rel-
ative motion of colliding partners along which fragmen-
tation takes place is divided into two ranges R ≤ R0
and R > R0, the inner and outer ones, respectively.
In contrast to the inner range where transfers in en-
ergy, momentum, angular momentum, spin, or the for-
mation of a transient complex occur due to the strong
interactions there, channels are decoupled in the outer
range, and the motion is governed by ordinary second-
order diﬀerential equations and described by superpo-

sitions of the energy-normalized regular and irregular
base pair (fj(R),gj(R)), or incoming and outgoing base
pair (exp(−ikjR), exp(ikjR)). For an N -channel system,
N independent degenerate solutions of the Schr¨odinger
equation for the decoupled motion in R > R0 may be
expressed into a standing-wave type

Ψi(R, ω) =

Φj(ω)[fj(R)δji − gj(R)Kji],

where Φj(ω) are the channel basis functions for the coor-
dinate space excluding R and φ±
j deﬁned as (±fj +igj)/2.
Kji and Sji denote the (j, i)-elements of short-range re-
actance and scattering matrices, respectively, and are
related with each other in matrix notation by S =
(1 − iK)(1 + iK)−1 (S is here taken as a complex conju-
gate of the usual deﬁnition, for convenience). Using the
quantum defect theory parameters ηj, βj, and Dj in Ref.
[22] for an arbitrary ﬁeld, φ±
j are given in the outer range
R > R0 by −i(mj/2πkj)1/2 exp(±iηj)f ±
for open chan-
j
nels and ∓(mj/πκj)1/2 exp(±iβj)(Djf +
j )/2 for
closed channels, where f ±

j ±iD−1
j denote exp(±ikjR).

Though all the N solutions are needed to describe the
motion in the intermediate range, some of them become
closed and no longer exist in the limit of R → ∞. In the
present work, we will consider the case involving only
one closed and many, say N0, open channels at large
R, i.e. N = N0 + 1. We will denote the set of open
channels by P and that of closed ones by Q. Open
channels will be marked with 1,2,...,N0 and the follow-
ing single closed channel with c instead of N for easy
recognition. Though meaningful only at large R, still
it may be convenient to keep the classiﬁcation of chan-
nels as open or closed in the intermediate range. The
wavefunction for the photofragmentation process into
the i-th fragmentation channel, denoted as Ψ(−)
, should
satisfy the incoming-wave boundary condition Ψ(−)
i →
at large R[23] and can be ob-
tained by making a linear combination of incoming chan-
(cid:1)

nel basis functions Ψ(−)
(3), substituting the
explicit forms for φ±
j given above and then setting the
coeﬃcients of exponentially rising terms to zero. This
procedure yields S = Soo − Soc(Scc − e2iβ)−1Sco, where
the indices o and c stand for open and closed compo-
nents, respectively. The second term shows that reso-
nances come from the pole structure of the inverse ma-
trix [Scc − exp(2iβ)]−1 due to the closed channel. The
ﬁrst term Soo, which contain couplings only among open
channels, cannot be regarded as corresponding to the
background one in the usual resonance theory such as the
conﬁguration mixing method (CM) of Fano[15] because

of its failure to satisfy the unitary condition. To ﬁnd the
corresponding one to the background scattering matrix
SB of CM, we rewrite the physical scattering matrix S
into a form more analogous to that of CM as

S = σoo + 2i

tan β + κcc

,

(4)

where κcc is a new kind of complex reactance matrix
studied extensively by Lecomte and deﬁned by Scc =
(1 − iκcc)(1 + iκcc)−1[7]. The new scattering matrix σoo
in Eq. (4) is deﬁned as K oo = −i(1 + σoo)−1(1 − σoo)
and, now pleasingly, unitary. From the deﬁnition, both
symmetric σoo and K oo are simultaneously diagonalized
as U exp(−2iδ0)U T and U tan δ0U T , respectively, by the
same orthogonal matrix U . Eq. (4) then becomes

S = U e−iδ0

where ξ denotes the column vector given by cos δ0U T K oc.
Notice that ξT ξ = K co(1 + K oo2)−1K oc = −ℑ(κcc),
which is a scalar here, but generally a matrix and plays
the key role in Lecomte’s work[7]. Since ξT ξ is positive
deﬁnite, it can be denoted as ξT ξ = ξ2. Elements of the
column vector ξ are real but cannot be made positive, in
general, by redeﬁning U since the latter is restricted by
det U = 1. The sum of their squares is equal to ξ2, i.e.

i = ξ2.

In order to utilize Hazi’s theorem that, for an isolated
P
resonance in a multichannel system, sum of eigenphases
satisﬁes the resonance behavior of an elastic phase shift,
the determinant of S is calculated by making use of the
mathematical techniques in his paper[24] as

(cid:3)

Following the lead of Giusti-Suzor and Fano[3], we may
try to separate out geometrical factors from channel cou-
pling strength by translating axes to make the Lu-Fano-
like plot for δΣ vs. β symmetrical by the phase renor-
malization described in Eq. (1). By the latter procedure,
part of the dynamics manifested in the short-range reac-
tance and scattering matrices K and S move into base
pairs for motions in decoupled channels. The net eﬀect is
to transform the phase shifts ηj (j = 1, ..., N0) and β of
the original base pairs for open and closed channels into
′ = ηj + πµj and β′ = β + πµc, respectively. We will
ηj
call the new representation, in which the Lu-Fano-like
plot for δΣ vs. β is symmetrical, the tilde representation.

The associated dynamical parameters wii be accented by
the tilde. Then

tan ˜δΣ tan ˜β = ℑ(˜κcc) = − ˜ξ2

(8)

with ˜δ0
Σ = 0 and ℜ(˜κcc) = 0. Eq. (8) implies that we can
identify ˜δΣ with the phase shift δr due to the resonance.
For isolated resonances, δr varies as a function of energy
as cot δr = −ǫr ≡ −2(E − E0)/Γ. Notice that Eq. (8)
holds for all the resonances belonging to the same closed
channel, yielding the extension of the deﬁnition of δr from
cot δr = −ǫr to cot δr = − tan ˜β/ ˜ξ2. Here, we observe
that there are inﬁnite sets of {µ1, ..., µN0} satisfying ˜δ0
Σ
= δ0
Σ + πµΣ = 0 and thus yielding Eq. (8). A convenient
choice may be µ1 = µΣ and µj = 0 (j = 2, ..., N0). Let
us denote this particular set by µo
S. Observables are not
aﬀected by this arbitrariness as we will see later.

(cid:8)

Since ˜δ0

Now let us consider obtaining µΣ and µc which give
rise to the tilde representation. The value of µc which
yields ℜ(˜κcc) = 0 is easily obtained as tan 2πµc =
2ℜ(κcc)/(1 − |κcc|2) from the transformation relation ˜κcc
= (κcc sin πµc + cos πµc)−1(κcc cos πµc − sin πµc) derived
It may be expressed more compactly
by Lecomte[7].
in terms of Scc as exp(−2iπµc) = Scc/|Scc|,
indicat-
ing that the phase of Scc is removed so as to make
˜Scc real and subsequently ˜κcc pure imaginary. Next,
let us consider obtaining µΣ which yields ˜δ0
Σ = 0. Un-
der the phase renormalization, σoo is transformed into
Soo − SocSco/[Scc + exp(−2iπµc)]
˜σoo = exp(iπµo)
exp(iπµo). Then, the determinant of ˜σoo is calculated
(cid:9)
as exp(2iπµΣ) [det(S) + exp(−2iπµc) det(Soo)]/[Scc +
Σ = 0, det(˜σoo) equals unity
exp(−2iπµc)].
and one obtains the formula for exp(2iπµΣ) as [Scc +
exp(−2iπµc)]/[exp(−2iπµc) det(Soo) + det(S)], where
exp(−2iπµc) = Scc/|Scc| as already obtained. This for-
mula for exp(2iπµΣ) may be used to obtain the re-
lation between ˜ξ2 and ξ2 in conjunction with the re-
lations det(S) = exp[−2iπ(µΣ + µc)] and det(Soo) =
exp(−2iπµΣ)(1 − ˜ξ2)/(1 + ˜ξ2) available after studying
the transformation (11) later. By substituting the rela-
tions into the formula, we obtain ˜ξ2 = 2ξ2/{1 + |κcc|2 +
[(1 + |κcc|2)2 − 4ξ4]1/2}. It can be expressed more com-
pactly in terms of |Scc| as ˜ξ2 = (1 − |Scc|)/(1 + |Scc|),
indicating tanh πα = ˜ξ2 if Scc is parameterized with
Dubau and Seaton’s complex quantum defect µc − iα
as exp[−2iπ(µc − iα)][5], which is equivalent to Eq. (35)
of Ref. [3]. Notice that ˜ξ2 ≤ 1. If |ℑ(˜κcc)| > 1, Eq. (8)
could be transformed into tan ˜δ′
Σ tan ˜β′ = 1/ℑ(˜κcc) with
Σ + π/2 and ˜β = ˜β′ + π/2 as described in Ref. [3].
˜δΣ = ˜δ′
In this case, ˜ξ2 might be identiﬁed with −1/ℑ(˜κ).

In contrast to the two channel case[3], making the Lu-
Fano-like plot symmetrical is not enough to separate out
the strength of channel coupling from the geometrical
parameters in the short-range reactance matrix, as evi-
denced by the nonzero K oo and K cc. If there are more
than two open channels, K oo cannot be made zero with
µΣ alone. The transformation to make both K oo and

3

± =

i Φiφ±

K cc zero was devised by Lecomte and Ueda[7, 8] by ex-
tending the transformation of Giusti-Suzor and Fano. In
the present work, their prescription to make both reac-
tance submatrices zero is a little modiﬁed in order to
utilize the resonance structure in the sum of the eigen-
phase shifts as stated above. Let us brieﬂy describe their
transformation. It is conveniently expressed in terms of
φ±
j as Φjφ′
i Wij exp(±iπµj), where W is
j
an orthogonal matrix with W co and W oc set to zero.
Then, W cc is just unity for the one closed channel case.
This leaves orthogonal transformations only among base
pairs of open channels. The second term exp(±iπµj) in-
′ = ηj + πµj
duces the phases to be renormalized as ηj
(j = 1, ..., N0) for open channels and as β′ = β + πµc for
the closed channel. The transformation is conveniently
denoted by Lecomte as T (πµc, πµo, W oo), where µo is
a set of µ1, ..., µNo. For the transformation composed
of two successive operations like T (0, ˜δo, ˜U )T (0, 0, Ur) of
diagram (11) , consult Appendix A.

P

Now let us go back to the problem of ﬁnding the trans-
formation which makes ˜K oo and ˜K cc zero. Though this
problem is already solved by Lecomte[7], let us give a
brief description of it for the subsequent description.
With T (0, πµo, W oo), ˜K oo is transformed into ˜K ′
=
( ˜KW sin πµo + cos πµo)−1( ˜KW cos πµo − sin πµo) where
˜KW = W ooT ˜K ooW oo. Let ˜U diagonalize ˜K oo,
i.e.,
˜U T ˜K oo ˜U = tan ˜δ0. Then, T (0, ˜δ0, ˜U ) transforms ˜K oo
into a zero matrix. ˜K cc is transformed into zero too as
a by-product, which derives from two theorems. First,
˜κcc does not change value under any transformation with
µc = 0. Therefore, ℜ(˜κcc) = 0 remains invariant under
T (0, ˜δ0, ˜U). Secondly, κcc = K cc − iK coK oc if K oo = 0,
whereby one has K cc = ℜ(κcc).

oo

Let us call the new representation generated by
T (0, ˜δ0, ˜U) the bar-representation. In this case, the phys-
ical scattering matrix ¯S becomes 1 − 2i exp(−iδr) sin δr ˜ξ
˜ξT / ˜ξ2. Since ˜ξ ˜ξT is a N0 × N0 symmetric matrix of rank
1, it can be diagonalized by some orthogonal matrix, say
Ur, as

where pr satisﬁes the property of a projection matrix. If
r prUr = Pr, ¯S can be written as exp(−2iδrPr),
we put U T
which suggests a new representation where the physi-
cal scattering matrix is diagonal as exp(−2iδrpr).
It
is easily seen that the new representation is generated
by T (0, 0, Ur). Let us call the new representation the
r-representation. In this representation, the short-range
N × N reactance matrix Kr has only two nonzero ele-
ments whose value is just the strength of channel cou-

where the set µo
S is given by{µΣ, 0, ..., 0} as introduced
before. Once made symmetrical by the translation of the
axes, the graph of δΣ vs. ˜β remains moveless under fur-
ther transformations T (0, ˜δ0, ˜U ) and T (0, 0, Ur). We will
call this kind of representations, which share the identical
location of the graph on the plot, the resonance-centered
representation hereinafter. The departure of our proce-
dure from Lecomte’s one lies in that K oo is not made into
a zero matrix as the ﬁrst step but only phases are renor-
malized so as to symmetrize the plot for δΣ vs. ˜β. This of-
fers several advantages. The background part eliminated
in the last two representations of diagram (11) is nothing
but disentangled by the ﬁrst process, enabling us to iden-
tify its MQDT form. The fact that the last two transfor-
mations operate only on the open channel set indicates
that the resonance eﬀect due to the closed channel is al-
ready fully accounted for by the phase renormalization
alone. This enables us to separate out the background
and resonant contributions in the partial cross-section
formulas, which is the topic of the next section.

an initial bound state to the j-th fragment one. The

Notice that the term (tan β + i)(tan β + κcc)−1 is
the same for all the resonance-centered representations
as (tan β + i)[tan β + iℑ(κcc)]−1 and is very energy-

−(i/ ˜ξ)(dδr/d ˜β)1/2 exp[−i( ˜β + δr)] obtainable from it by
means of tan ˜β tan δr = − ˜ξ2. Let us introduce new short-

Φc(φ+
( R ≥ R0) is
identical to the asymptotic form of ψ−(j)
if the one-to-
one correspondence between σoo and SB is taken into
account. The decoupled form, however, contains an ad-
ditional closed channel term which rises exponentially
at large R, showing that M (−)
by itself is not a phys-
j
ically acceptable wavefunction in contrast to the back-
ground one. But its contribution to cross-sections is still
ﬁnite since it is multiplied by an initial wavefunction that
may be reasonably assumed to be bound. This indicates
that the background part SB of the scattering matrix S
(=SBSR) of CM actually contains closed channel con-
tributions. The closed channel contribution into M (−)
is
given by the form of φ+
c + φ−
c which is equal to i times
the irregular function gi. It shows that the regular func-
tion for the closed channel contributes nothing to M (−)
,
presumably indicating that M (−)
is the form of mini-
mal closed channel contribution in the intermediate and
reaction zones and thus in the observables. This claim
requires further study for sure.

Eq. (15) may be used to obtain

, ℜ( ˜qj),
ℑ( ˜qj), µc, and ˜ξ2 from the experimental data using the
method developed in the ﬁeld of modeling of data[26] (the
form of β as a function of energy needed for data ﬁtting is
given analytically for most ﬁelds but should be obtained
numerically for the zero ﬁeld using the Milne procedure
described in Ref.
[22]). But Eq. (15) is not expressed
in terms of parameters whose physical origins are clearly
identiﬁed. The r-representation may be used for that pur-
pose since the channel coupling strength can only be com-
pletely disentangled there from the geometrical factors
and the formulation is additionally simpliﬁed too by the
fact that only one open process can be involved there for
the resonance. Introducing the r-representation is equiv-
alent to visualizing the photofragmentation process as
being excited to eigenchannels of Sr but observed in the
detector through their projections to the detector eigen-
channels. By the fact that Sr is already diagonalized
as exp(−2iδrpr) with eigenvalues {exp(−2iδr), 1, ..., 1}
and K cc
r = 0, the well-known formulas for the eigenchan-
nel wavefunctions Ψr

to Ψr1 cos δr + Ψr c sin δr/ ˜ξ for k = 1 and Ψrk otherwise.

(Notice that all the representations connected by the
phase renormalization have the common value of ˜ρj. This
is consistent with the fact that phase renormalization
does not change the absolute magnitude of a transition
dipole matrix element.) Then it may be shown that the
second term inside the brackets of the right-hand side of
Eq. (19) is just 1 − ˜ρj. Substituting this and Eqs. (20)
into Eq. (19), we obtain Eq. (15) but now with ˜qj ex-
pressed in terms of parameters qr and ˜ρj of clear physical
origin as

˜qj = qr ˜ρj + i(1 − ˜ρj).

tice that Ψri are real quantities as are ψ(λ)

one correspondence between wavefunctions found from
the comparison of MQDT’s ˜ρj with CM’s ρj. Here, we
only talked about the analogy between formulas of two
theories not the actual relations of corresponding terms
in two theories. The relations may be derivable from the
prescription described in Ref. [14]. For example, it may
be found that Ψri equals ψ(a)

E + O( ˜ξ2) (λ 6= a) otherwise.
Finally, let us consider about dynamical parameters
extractable from the total and partial photofragmenta-
tion cross-sections. Since total cross-sections are pro-
, Eq. (18) may be used to ﬁt
portional to
the experimental data of total cross-sections. Levenberg-
Marquardt method[26] may be employed for such a
2
,
data ﬁtting to obtain the information on

(Ψr 1|T |i)
, qr, ˜ξ2, and µc.
Information on
the absolute value of (Ψrc|T |i) and its relative sign to
P
˜ξ(Ψr 1|T |i) may be obtained from qr, since it is deﬁned as
−(Ψrc|T |i)/[ ˜ξ(Ψr1|T |i)]. For the partial cross-sections,
| tan ˜β/ ˜ξ2 + ˜qj|2/(tan2 ˜β/ ˜ξ4 + 1) is changed to the form
consisted of real terms as [tan ˜β/ ˜ξ2+ℜ(qj)]2/(tan2 ˜β/ ˜ξ4+
1) + [ℑ(qj )]2/(tan2 ˜β/ ˜ξ4 + 1), which may be used to ex-
tract ℜ(˜qj) and [ℑ(˜qj)]2. Notice that the data ﬁtting
leaves the sign of ℑ(˜qj) undetermined. After ˜qj is ob-
tained up to the sign of its imaginary part, ˜ρj is obtain-
able from the relation ˜qj = qr ˜ρj + i(1 − ˜ρj), which yields
the quadratic equation for ˜ρj and eventually gives two
˜ρj compatible with both ˜qj and ˜q∗

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We conﬁrmed again, for the case involving one closed
and many open channels, the striking similarities be-
tween MQDT and CM formulas found for the case in-
volving one closed and two open channels[14] if MQDT
is reformulated by means of Giusti-Suzor and Fano’s
phase renormalization and Lecomte and Ueda’s addi-
tional orthogonal transformation. The unitarity of ˜σoo
[≡ (1−i ˜K oo)(1+i ˜K oo)−1] and its simultaneous diagonal-
izability with ˜K oo by the same orthogonal transformation
are newly found to play the pivotal role in the reformula-
tion. By this reformulation, we found the one-to-one cor-
respondence between two diﬀerent manifestations, ˜M (−)
j + Ψ(−)
and Ψrj, of the form Ψ(−)
cj
of MQDT and the background wavefunction ψ−(j)
and
(cid:3)
(cid:2)
Fano’s ‘abc..’
states of CM, respectively, and also be-
tween ˜σoo of MQDT and the background scattering ma-
trix SB of CM. Under this correspondence, formulas in
both theories exactly coincide with each other when fur-
ther one-to-one correspondence coming from the exten-
sion of − cot δr = 2(E − E0)/Γ of CM to tan δr tan ˜β =
− ˜ξ2 of MQDT taken into account. Note that the refor-
mulation allows MQDT to have the full power of the CM
theory, still keeping its own strengths such as the fun-
damental description of resonance phenomenon without
any assumption of the presence of a discrete state as in
CM.

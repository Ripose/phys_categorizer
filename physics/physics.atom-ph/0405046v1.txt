We report an experimental and theoretical study of the dynamics of cold atoms subjected to
closely-spaced pairs of pulses in an optical lattice. The experiments show the interplay between fully
coherent quantum dynamics and a novel momentum-diﬀusion regime: for all previously-studied δ-
kicked systems, chaotic classical dynamics shows diﬀusion with short-time (2 or 3-kick) correlations;
here, chaotic diﬀusion combines with new types of long-ranged ‘global’ correlations, between all
kick-pairs, which control transport through trapping regions in phase-space. Analytical formulae
are presented and, with quantum localization, are used to analyse the experiments.

The ‘δ-kicked particle’ (δ-KP) is one of the most stud-
ied experimental and theoretical paradigms of classical
Hamiltonian chaos. A particle is kicked periodically by a
sinusoidal potential V (x, t) = −K cos x P δ(t − n). For
suﬃciently large K, the motion is fully chaotic and the
energy grows diﬀusively. Of particular interest in recent
years has been the theoretical [1, 2] and experimental
[3] investigation of the suppression of the classical dif-
fusive process in its quantum counterpart, the quantum
δ-kicked particle (δ-QKP). This phenomenon is gener-
ally termed ‘Dynamical Localization’ (DL). For K >∼ 1
the diﬀusive growth of the classical energy is no longer
bounded by phase-space barriers (tori) so persists indef-
initely : for an ensemble of classical particles, the energy
E =< P
4 t for all t. The corresponding
quantum energy grows only up to a timescale t∗ ∼ D/~2
[4] and saturates at a value < P 2 >t→∞∼ Dt∗. The
Texas experiments showed that cesium atoms in period-
ically pulsed waves of light were an ideal test-bed for
quantum chaos. A broad range of interesting physical
regimes were subsequently investigated: controlled deco-
herence [5], quantum accelerator modes [6] and delocal-
ization induced by non-periodic kicking [7].

The chaotic diﬀusion is however not entirely uncorre-
lated [8] and there are corrections which have now been
experimentally observed [9] due to 2-kick and 3-kick cor-
relations. For example, a 2-kick correction appears be-
cause the ensemble averaged value for the correlation be-
tween the impulse at the n−th kick and that experienced
2-kicks later, C2 =< V ′(xn)V ′(xn+2) > is generally non-
zero, see [8, 12]. In [10, 11] it was further shown that,
if the pulses are unequally spaced, the 2-kick corrections
yield a local (in momentum) correction to the diﬀusion.
In that case, 2E(P0, t) = D(P0, t) t :
for unequal kick
spacings, both the diﬀusion rate and hence the energy,
depend non-trivially on time and the relative initial mo-
mentum, P0, between the atoms and the standing wave
of light.

In this work we report the ﬁrst experimental and the-
oretical study of the 2δ-kicked particle (2δ-KP): a cloud
of cesium atoms is exposed to a periodic sequence of
closely spaced pairs of kicks. At the outset, one might ex-
pect that the diﬀusive behaviour here could be analysed

within the framework used in [9, 10], of diﬀusion with cor-
relations between short sequences of 2 or 3 kicks, whether
local or otherwise. However this approach fails to explain
the experimental results. Further investigation showed
that chaotic diﬀusion in the 2δ-KP was rather diﬀerent
from that seen in previously studied kicked systems. For
the 2δ-KP one ﬁnds new corrections, which appear in
families correlating all kicks democratically. These cor-
rections are individually very weak, but become numer-
ous with time and accumulate to eventually dominate
the diﬀusive process. Moreover, these ‘global’ correla-
tions can be associated with speciﬁc physical phenomena,
namely the escape from and through ‘trapping’ regions
in phase-space. We have identiﬁed diﬀusive regimes asso-
ciated with three types of correlation: one is an ordinary
1-kick correlation, C1, the other two are new and are fam-
ilies with ‘global’ terms. The experimental behaviour de-
pends on which correlations dominate at the point when
the quantum dynamics suppresses the diﬀusion.

FIG. 1: Surface of Section diagram for an ensemble of par-
ticles, with K = 7 and ǫ = 0.1, prepared with initial mo-
mentum P0 = 0 at t = 0. The SOS illustrates the trapping
of trajectories in phase space regions for which the momenta
pǫ ≃ ±(2n + 1)π.

The experimental apparatus is essentially like that de-

scribed in [11] and consists of a cloud of cesium atoms
collected in a standard 6-beam MOT and cooled in an op-
tical molasses to a temperature of 6µK. The sinusoidal
potential V (x, t) is formed by two counter-propagating
laser beams incident on the cloud with parallel polarisa-
tions. These are derived from a Titanium Sapphire laser,
have an intensity of 4 × 103Isat (Isat =1.12mWcm−2, the
saturation intensity) in each beam and are detuned 2000Γ
(Γ = 2π × 5.22MHz, the natural linewidth) below the D2
transition on cesium. The potential is switched on us-
ing acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) to create pulses as
short as tp = 300ns, and each beam is controlled by a
separate AOM so that a frequency diﬀerence ∆f may be
imposed upon the two beams and the potential moves
with constant velocity in the laboratory frame. In this
way we may explore the momentum dependence of the
diﬀusion constant as in the rest frame of the potential
the atomic momentum distribution has a non-zero mean
value P0 ∝ ∆f .

We now have two periods: τ , which represents a (long)
timescale between the pairs of kicks, and ǫ, which repre-
sents a much smaller time interval between kicks in each
pair. In the experiment, τ = 9.47µs, while ﬁve diﬀerent
separations of the closely-spaced pair, in the range 0.44µs
to 1.48µs were used: ǫ = 0.047, 0.063, 0.094, 0.125 and
0.156. For these parameters and with the intensity and
detuning as above, we have an eﬀective value of ~ = 1
while the kick-strength, K = 3.3 (±10% due mainly to
the uncertainty in measuring the intensity in the laser
beams). Up to 100 kicks were applied before the cloud
of atoms was allowed to evolve freely in the dark for
15ms. A pair of near-resonant imaging beams were then
switched on and the ﬂuorescence imaged on a CCD cam-
era. From the spatial distribution of the ﬂuorescence the
momentum distribution was extracted and hP 2i calcu-
lated.

The corresponding classical behaviour of the 2δ-KP

would be given by evolving a 2-kick map:

pi = pi−1 + K sin xi−1
xi = xi−1 + piǫ
pi+1 = pi + K sin xi
xi+1 = xi + pi+1τ

It is instructive to begin by considering the classical evo-
lution of an ensemble of particles all initially at time t =
0, with momentum p = P0 for which P0ǫ = (2n+ 1)π and
n = 0, 1, ... These particles experience a kick K sin xi−1
followed by another at ≃ K sin(xi−1 + π) which in eﬀect
cancels the ﬁrst. Conversely in the case P0ǫ = 2nπ a
series of near-identical kicks produces initially rapid en-
ergy growth. Other P0 produce intermediate behaviour.
This behaviour follows from the unsurprising fact that
the presence of the short time interval, ǫ, results in a
non-zero kick-to-kick correlation C1. In contrast, for the
Standard Map and all other previously studied atomic
δ-kicked systems, C1 = 0.

We show, in Fig.1, Surface of Section plots obtained
from an ensemble intially with P0 = 0, but randomly
distributed in position x, for K = 7, ǫ = 0.1. It is clear
that, though the phase-space here is fully chaotic, tra-
jectories ‘stick’ at the values of pǫ ≃ ±(2n + 1)π. By
calculating C1 explicitly, after N pairs of kicks, one can
begin a more precise analysis:

C1(N, P0) = K 2 cos P0ǫ[J0(Kǫ) − J2(Kǫ)]

(0.1)

Physical time is t = N (τ + ǫ). We can re-scale variables
so τ = 1 and t ≃ N . The ensemble-averaged energy E of
the atom cloud at time t, corrected by Eq.0.1 would be
given by 2E =< (Pt −P0)2 >≃ K 2T /2+C1(t, P0) (where
T = 2N = 2t). It is easily shown that for short times C1
grows linearly in time, while for longer times it saturates
to a constant value, after a time t1 ∼ 10
(Kǫ)2 . On this
time-scale, the kick-to-kick contributions decay to zero.
Since C1 is a single correlation term, analogous to those
studied in [10] we have here been able to simply extend
the usual analysis of [10, 12]. For small Kǫ, J2(Kǫ) ≃ 0,
so for short times (t << t1) we can write for the energy,
2E =< (Pt − P0)2 >≃ K 2T /2[1 + cos P0ǫ]. The validity
of this formula for t << t1 is seen in the experimental
data in Fig.2(a).

Fig.2 show the energy absorbed by the cesium atoms,
as a function of P0. Three separate values of ǫ were
considered. For each ǫ, the energy was measured, after
100 kicks (but here t∗ ∼ 40) for many values of P0. In
every case, at time t = 0, the atom cloud had energy
< (Pt=0 − P0)2 >≃ 30, indicated by the horizontal dot-
dashed line.

The experimental data of Fig.2(a) is the most straight-
forward to understand: here, t1 ∼ 450, so t∗ << t1
so the energy absorption was arrested in the regime
t << t1. An ensemble of classical particles, initially at
momenta P0ǫ ≃ ±(2n + 1)π, absorbs no energy while for
P0ǫ ≃ ±2nπ, energy absorption is maximal.

Fig.2(c), on the other hand, was the most surprising.
It corresponds to a regime t∗ > t1.
It shows a clear
reversal of the behaviour seen in Fig.2(a): atoms initially
prepared at or near the momentum-trapping regions end
up with more energy than those prepared in the enhanced
momentum diﬀusion regions. In fact, atoms which are
prepared furthest from the momentum trapping regions,
absorb the least energy.

This counter-intuitive observation motivated a more
look at the mathematical model of the dif-
careful
fusive process of the 2δ-KP. This exposed a collec-
tion of terms involving averaging products of the form
sin xi sin xµ, where µ < i but is otherwise arbitrary;
while i represents any of the second kicks in the
pair. For each µ we obtain a correction of the form
1 (Kǫ) Pj(J0(Kǫ))2j−3. These terms are
4K 2 cos P0ǫ J 2
negligibly small (O(Kǫ)2 relative to C1). However since

ble of 100,000 classical particles, all with p = P0 at t = 0,
as a function of initial momentum (dashed line). These nu-
merics are superposed with analytical formulae obtained for

ure, but the number of kicks, 2N , varies. Note the behaviour
in the trapping region P0 ≃ π/ǫ ≃ 60: the energy absorbed

which C1 competes with the ‘global’ de-phasing family CG1.
This exposes the ‘Poisson-sum-formula’ corrections: a fam-
ily of corrections of the form CP m ∝ cos mP0ǫ, (m ≥ 2)
combine to give a series of inverted peaks in the trapping
regions (c) All three corrections CP , C1 and CG1 compete (d)
At t > 500 the longest lived correction, CG1 dominates. The
Poisson corrections have changed sign: the inverted peaks of
(c) (indicating trapping), have ‘ﬂipped over’ to give a series of
positive peaks which give the maxima a ‘pointed’ appearance.
The counter-intuitive result, that particles initially prepared
in the momentum-trapping regions will be the ones which will
acquire the most energy, is evident.

this term grows quadratically at small t and eventually
overtakes C1. It has opposite sign to C1; we interpret it as
a term which reﬂects the gradual de-phasing of the reso-
nant eﬀects of C1 -such as the kick-cancellation/trapping
regions with P0ǫ ∼ (2n + 1)π). At long times the be-
haviour is dominated by CG1 and hence we see that the
energy absorption is maximal for particles prepared near
P0ǫ ≃ ±(2n + 1)π.

Fig.2(b) corresponds to a particularly interesting
regime, where C1 ∼ CG1. The cos P0ǫ correction is
partly cancelled, exposing a series of narrow dips in
the energy. The origin of these dips is in a series of
terms CP m ∝ cos mP0ǫ. When summed these pro-
duce behaviour reminiscent of the Poisson sum formula
Pm cos mP0ǫ = Pn δ(P0ǫ − (2n + 1)π). The amplitudes
of the CP m terms vary with time and only a ﬁnite num-

ber of harmonics (m < 10 typically) contributes at any
given time. Hence we get a series of broadened peaks.
Nevertheless, for this reason, we term these corrections
the Poisson term, CP = P CP m and where:

CP m(N, P0) ∝ K 2 cos mP0ǫFm(t)

n=1

Fm(t) is a time function which grows as ∼ tm. Though
these terms are small (O(Kǫ)2m−2) they will contribute
when tm(Kǫ)2m−2 ∼ 1. Each of these terms also
has a partner ‘global’ family of opposite sign, CGP m
(O(Kǫ)2m), which increase as ∼ tm+1. Fig.2 (d) shows
the behaviour of the m = 2 Poisson terms in compari-
son to C1 and CG1. As m increases terms become less
signiﬁcant and for each m the global correlation always
dominates CP m at long times. There are additional, even
higher-order, cos nP0ǫ terms (n ≥ 1) of similar form to
CP m and CGP m above and a group of terms involving
products of the form sin2 xi which may contribute, par-
ticularly to CP 2.

In Fig.3 we compare numerical (classical) calculations
at K = 7, ǫ = 0.05, with the behaviour predicted by the
correlations. In Fig.3(a) we look at short times and see
that we can accurately match the energy absorption by
including only the three lowest order diﬀusive corrections,
ie those which increase linearly or quadratically in time
(C1, CG1, CP 2). At later times (t < 50 or so), we obtain
good agreement by including all the above terms up to
order J 10
1 and m = 4: the inverted peaks correspond-
ing to the trapping regions are quite well reproduced, as
seen in Fig.3(b). At extremely long times, we can obtain
good results simply from the leading global family CG1.
We also clearly see, in Fig.3(d), the inversion of the be-
haviour seen at earlier times: atoms prepared within the
trapping regions give positive peaks, since CGP m domi-
nates. The 0 − th order term is < P 2 >≃ K 2T /2 at very
short times, then gradually slows down to an asymptotic
value ≃ K 2T /16 (obtained numerically) at long times.
The analytical curves in Fig.3 are shifted vertically by a
constant amount.

In conclusion, we have presented and analysed an ex-
perimental realisation of a 2δ − KP and shown that it
corresponds to a type of diﬀusion quite diﬀerent from
the Standard Map. This is a rich and complex system
and many questions remain open. On the classical side,

4

certain aspects of the interactions and lifetimes of the
diﬀerent types of correlations are not yet well under-
stood. Although we have a generic handle on this sys-
tem with the diﬀusion correlations, further insight might
be gained by detailed knowledge of classical trajectories.
For lower values of Kǫ, a thin band of islands and eventu-
ally unbroken tori appears ﬁrst around pǫ ≃ ±(2n + 1)π.
At this point, clearly, there will be no escape through
the trapping regions and beyond the very shortest times
(t1 << 1/(Kǫ)2) the diﬀusive correlation approach would
fail everywhere. We expect regions permeated by broken
phase-space barriers to persist at the parameters such as
eg. Fig.1 and to account for the trapping regions.

The quantum behaviour is also not fully understood.
Though clearly some key features can be modelled qual-
itatively in Fig.2 by adjusting the number of kicks and
K (by up to 10% in the classical numerics of Fig.2), the
quantum dynamics will involve tunnelling and dynamical
localization (DL) eﬀects which can introduce substantial
diﬀerences with the classical behaviour. Further investi-
gation of the DL in this system is necessary: its Floquet
states are localised, like in the standard δ − KP . But
in the latter, localization lengths, L, are quite uniform
with exponential localization and L ∼ D
~ , while in the
2δ − KP , values of L can vary by about 3 orders of mag-
nitudes for the parameters considered here [14].

Although the t << t1 experimental regime (seen in
Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)) is in some sense the least surprising
in terms of the diﬀusive process, it is worth noting its
potential for atomic manipulation. Interest in the 2δ-KP
experiment was initially stimulated by its potential ap-
plications in manipulating atoms in devices like an atom
‘chip’ [13]. In [10] it was proposed that a local diﬀusion
rate D(P0), could be exploited for ‘ﬁltering’ cold atoms
according to their velocity. For selected P0 the atoms
could pass the device unperturbed, while other momenta
would absorb a substantial amount of energy and would
be dispersed. The 2δ-QKP showed a far stronger experi-
mental signature than the system in [10, 11] which relied
on a two-kick, C2, correlation (note that C2 6= CP 2).
A much stronger velocity-selective eﬀect, due to the C1,
correlation is seen for the 2δ-QKP. The inverted peaks of
the Cp correlations could also be used to select a narrow
band of velocities with P0 ≃ π/ǫ.

Abstract

The cross section for single K-shell ionization by a high-energy photon is evaluated in the next-to-leading

order of the nonrelativistic perturbation theory with respect to the electron-electron interaction. The screen-

ing corrections are of particular importance for light helium-like ions. Even in the case of neutral He atom,

our analytical predictions turn out to be in good agreement with the numerical calculations performed with

the use of the sophisticated wave functions. The universal high-energy behavior is studied for the ratio of

double-to-single photoionization cross sections. We also discuss the fast convergence of the perturbation

theory over the reversed nuclear charge number 1/Z.

The single and double photoeﬀects on the helium isoelectronic sequence represent the simplest

fundamental processes, which are being intensively investigated during last decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

The accurate treatment of electron correlations is still one of the main theoretical problems. Due

to recent developments of novel synchrotron radiation sources, the study of the ionization of inner-

shell electrons by high-energy photons is of particular interest.

For the theoretical description of the ionization processes on light atomic systems, it is usual to

employ sophisticated methods with highly correlated wave functions. This allows one to take into

account electron correlation eﬀects beyond the independent-particle approximation. However, all

the methods suﬀer from the gauge dependence. The latter can serve as a level of accuracy for the

theoretical predictions. In addition, the ﬁnal results for cross sections of the ionization processes

are presented in a numerical form, which is not always easy to analyze.

In the case of heavy multicharged ions, on the contrary, the usual starting point is the approx-

imation of non-interacting electrons, which are described by the Coulomb wave functions for the

discrete and continuous spectra. The electron-electron interaction is treated within the framework

of perturbation theory, which is also referred to as the expansion with respect to the parameter

1/Z. The latter represents the ratio of the strength of the electron-electron interaction to the

electron-nucleus one. To leading orders, perturbation theory allows one to derive analytical re-

sults. Accounting for higher-order correlation corrections improves the accuracy of the analytical

predictions in the domain of lower values of the nuclear charge number Z. The results obtained

within the framework of perturbation theory for the binding energies and for the cross sections are

gauge independent.

In this Letter, we evaluate the next-to-leading-order correlation correction to the cross section

for single K-shell ionization at asymptotic photon energies ω characterized by I

I = η2/(2m) is the Coulomb potential for single ionization with η = mαZ being the average

momentum of a K-shell electron, m is the electron mass, and α is the ﬁne-structure constant

(~ = 1, c = 1). The ejected electrons are considered as being nonrelativistic. Accordingly, the

Coulomb parameter is supposed to be suﬃciently small, that is, αZ

In general, the nonrelativistic interaction between an electron and a photon

includes also spin-dependent terms. However, in the case of single and double photoeﬀects the

corresponding contributions to the cross sections are strongly suppressed [8, 9, 10] and, therefore,

can be neglected.

In the nonrelativistic approximation, spatial and spin parts of two-electron wave functions

factorize. Moreover, the operator (1) does not involve the spin matrices. As a result, the spin

functions can be omitted throughout this consideration, while the symmetry of the coordinate

wave functions Ψ(r1, r2) is preserved in the ionization process. The total amplitude of the single

photoeﬀect on helium-like ion is given by

The matrix element (5) can be represented by the Feynman graph depicted in Fig. 1(a). Apart

from the common factor, the expression (5) coincides with the amplitude for single photoeﬀect on

hydrogen-like ion in the ground state.

In the asymptotic region, the energy and momentum conservation laws for the single K-shell

photoionization keep the same form for both H- and He-like ions:

The latter is equivalent to the use of the dipole approximation. Then one can set q2 = p2 = 2mω

cross sections (12) and (13) are twice as large as that for the single photoeﬀect on a hydrogen-like

ion in the ground state. This is the consequence of the approximation of non-interacting electrons

employed in the derivation. Neither σ+

Now we shall consider in more details the evaluation of the next-to-leading-order correction

to the amplitude of single K-shell photoeﬀect on helium-like ion. In the high-energy nonrelativistic

limit, the dominant contribution to the amplitude of the process arises only from the Feynman

diagram depicted in Fig. 1(b), providing the Coulomb gauge is employed. This graph accounts

for the interaction between the electrons in the initial state. All other diagrams, namely, the one,

which accounts for the electron-electron interaction in the ﬁnal state, together with both exchange

diagrams, turn out to be suppressed by the factor of about I/ω and, therefore, can be neglected.

The negative sign of the coeﬃcient (31) can be understood on the qualitative ground. It is well

known that the single photoeﬀect does not proceed on the free electron, while it can occur on the

bound one [7]. The explanation of this fact follows from the relation (11): the nucleus serves as

an absorber of the recoil momentum q. In the asymptotic region, the value of q is relatively large,

since the condition q

η holds. The Coulomb calculation performed within the approximation

≫

of non-interacting electrons overestimates the cross section, because the electron-nucleus bindings

are utmost strong in this case. Accounting for the screening eﬀects attenuates these bindings, so

that, the cross section of the single photoionization reduces in the absolute value.

As we already mentioned, if the photon energy is not too high, the cross section σ+

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(35)

instead of Eq. (34).

As a testing ground for our analytical results, we choose the neutral He atom, which seems to

be the most thoroughly investigated two-electron system. However, although extensive numeri-

cal calculations of the photoionization cross sections have been published in the literature, there

are signiﬁcant disagreements between predictions based on diﬀerent sophisticated methods at high

photon energies. The diﬃculty of comparison with experimental data arises due to presence of

additional contributions from the scattering channels. One measures the total attenuation cross

section, but not exclusively the photoionization one [1, 2]. As the most accurate theoretical calcula-

tions of the photoionization cross sections at high-energy domain, Samson et. al. [1] have selected

results of the work [13]. Bell and Kingston used the Hartree-Fock wave function for the continuum

state and many-parametrical variational wave function for the ground state. At ω

3.5 keV their

≃

result for the cross section is equal to 5.74 b, which however exhibits a gauge dependence on the

level of about 6% [13]. Our analytical formulas (34) and (35) yield 8.24 b and 5.73 b, respectively.

In this case, the parameter ξ = 1/8, but the value πξ is not too small.

In the double photoeﬀect, one is usually interested in the ratio of double-to-single ionization

cross sections. At high photon energies, the calculations performed within the framework of the

leading-order perturbation theory yield

R0 =

σ++
0
σ+
0

=

B
Z 2 ,

(36)

(37)

where B = 0.090 [14, 15] and σ+

0 is given by Eq. (12). Taking into account the higher-order

screening corrections to the total cross sections leads to the following expression for the universal

asymptotic ratio

R = R0

(1 + b1Z −1 + b2Z −2 + . . .)
(1 + a1Z −1 + a2Z −2 + . . .)

.

The factor R0 is separated out here, since the electron binding energy is supposed to be negligibly

small compared to the photon energy. To any given order of the perturbation theory with respect

to the electron-electron interaction the representation (37) is the Pad´e approximant. The next-to-

leading-order coeﬃcient a1 is given by Eq. (31), while the other coeﬃcients remain to be calculated.

8

Nevertheless, employing experimental data for the double-to-single photoionization ratio, one can

deduce an estimate for the value of the coeﬃcient b1. The latter can be obtained by equating

the experimental value Rexp = 1.72(12)% measured for He atom [3] and the theoretical ratio (37)

truncated with taking into account only the next-to-leading-order correlation corrections. It yields

b1 =

0.981(71) .

−

(38)

Having ﬁxed the coeﬃcients a1 and b1, we have calculated the double-to-single photoionization

ratio for helium isoelectronic sequence. In Table I, we present a comparison of our next-to-leading-

order predictions according to Eq. (37) with the numerical results obtained by Forrey et al. [4]. The

account of the screening corrections improves signiﬁcantly the asymptotic behavior for the leading-

order ratio R0 in the case of light two-electron systems. This supports the statement concerning

the fast convergence of the 1/Z expansion even in the extreme nonrelativistic domain [16]. Indeed,

the starting approximation of the perturbation theory (assuming non-interacting electrons) would

be utmost inadequate for the description of light helium-like ions, which are highly correlated. The

relatively large values for the coeﬃcients (31) and (38) allow to correct the zeroth approximation.

Note also that the double-to-single photoionization ratio (37) turns out to be less sensitive to the

higher-order screening corrections rather than the total cross sections, since the coeﬃcients a1 and

b1 have the same sign. Unfortunately, the signiﬁcant uncertainty of the coeﬃcient (38) distorts
the true behavior of the ratio R in the case of H− ion. The coeﬃcients a2, b1, and b2 should be

calculated exactly within the framework of the consistent perturbation theory.

Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to trace out the nontrivial behavior of the series over the parameter

1/Z taking the binding energy for the ground state in H− ion as an example. Without the electron-

electron interaction the Coulomb binding energy is equal to 27.2116 eV. The corrections due to one-,

two-, and three-photon exchange diagrams are known to yield

17.0079 eV, 4.2921 eV [17, 18], and

−

0.1723 eV [18], respectively. Then the total binding energy turns out to be equal to 14.324 eV.

−
This should be compared with the exact numerical result of 14.361 eV, which has been obtained

within the approximation of an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus [19]. On the level of accuracy of about

10−2 eV one already needs to take into account the eﬀect of nuclear recoil. As seen, the terms

of the 1/Z expansion exhibit sign-changing oscillations and decrease fast in their absolute value.

Although the formal parameter of the perturbation theory is equal to 1, the actual expansion turns

out to converge by one order of magnitude due to hidden parameters of the theory.

Concluding, we have evaluated the single K-shell photoionization cross section with taking into

9

account the next-to-leading-order correlation correction. This allows one to improve the accuracy

of analytical predictions for light helium-like ions at high-energy domain. We have discussed the

universal behavior of the double-to-single photoionization ratio as well as the fast convergence of

the perturbation theory with respect the parameter 1/Z.

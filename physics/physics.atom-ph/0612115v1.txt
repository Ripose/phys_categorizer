A simple way to generate low energy phase shifts for elastic scattering using bound-state calcu-
lations is postulated, validated and applied to the problem of e+-Mg scattering. The essence of
the method is to use the energy shift between a small reference calculation and the largest possible
calculation of the lowest energy pseudo-state to tune a semi-empirical optical potential. The L = 1
partial wave for e+-Mg scattering is predicted to have a shape resonance at an energy of about 0.13
eV. The value of Zeﬀ at the center of the resonance is about 1500.

One of the most technically demanding problems in
quantum physics is the scattering problem, i.e. the pre-
diction of the reaction probabilities when two objects col-
lide [1]. The underlying diﬃculty lies in the unbounded
nature of the wave function. This leads to a variety of
computational and analytic complications that are sim-
ply absent in bound state calculations, e.g. the Schwartz
singularities that occur in the Kohn variational method
for scattering [2, 3].

One strategy adopted to solve scattering problems is
to use bound state methods. There are numerous exam-
ples of such approaches, one of the most popular being
the R-matrix methods that rely on the solutions of the
Schrodinger equation in a ﬁnite sized cavity to determine
the behaviour of the wave function in the interaction re-
gion [1]. The total wave function is then constructed
by splicing the inner wave function onto the asymptotic
wave function.

However, despite the considerable activity in this area,
there are a number of problems that are beyond resolu-
tion. The e+-atom problem is a notoriously hard numer-
ical problem since the atomic electrons tend to localize
around the positron, thus giving a very slowly conver-
gent partial wave expansion of the wave function inside
the interaction region (this should not be confused with
the partial wave expansion of the asymptotic wave func-
tion) [4, 5, 6, 7]. For example, the dimensionality of the
equations to be solved to achieve a given accuracy are
about 5 times larger for e+-H scattering than for e−-H
scattering. At present, there are a number of positron
collision problems that are simply inaccessible with ex-
isting approaches [7].

This article had its origin in a particular scattering
problem, namely the determination of the near thresh-
old phase shifts for positron scattering from the di-valent
group II and IIB atoms. The dimension of the secular
equations for bound state calculation on such systems
are very large, for example a CI calculation of the e+Ca
2Po state resulted in equations of dimension 874,448 [8].

Application of the CI-Kohn approach [9] to determine
the phase shifts for e+-Mg scattering in the 2Po channel
would result in linear equations that are simply too large
(≈ 1, 000, 000) to be solved by direct methods.
Itera-
tive methods do exist, but there are no robust methods
that absolutely guarantee convergence [10].
It is likely
that the development of an eﬃcient linear solver for the
class of problems that arise from a basis set treatment of
quantum scattering would involve a good deal of initial
eﬀort and experimentation. There is, however, a great
deal of experience in obtaining the lowest eigenvalues of
large symmetric matrices [11].

The idea behind the current method lies closest to the
trivial R-matrix method [12] which is exploited in Quan-
tum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of scattering [13].
In the QMC, one extracts the phase shift by comparing
the zero point energy of a ﬁnite size cavity to the energy
of the system wave function in the same cavity. In the
present method, the phase shift is extracted from the en-
ergy shift when a reference wave function is enlarged in
size to account for short and long range correlations. The
method is applied to e+-Mg scattering in the 2Po sym-
metry and used to predict the existence of a prominent
shape resonance at 0.13 eV incident energy. This is note-
worthy since shape resonances are currently unknown in
e+-atom or e+-molecule scattering [14].

Our method proceeds as follows. The initial calcula-
tion uses a reference CI wave function of product form,
viz

Ψ0 = Φgs(X)φ0(r) .
(1)
The wave function of the parent atom is Φgs(X) where
X is the collective set of target coordinates. The wave
function of the projectile is φ0(r). In general, φ0 is a lin-
ear combination of a ﬁnite number of square-integrable
functions designed to give a good representation of the
wave function in a bounded interaction region. The en-
ergy expectation, E0 is given by

E0 = hΨ0|Hexact|Ψ0i.

(2)

The wave function Ψ0 is then augmented by a very
large number of additional functions to represent the
correlations between the projectile and the target con-
stituents. This augmented trial function is

Ψ1 = Φgs(X)φ0(r) + X

ci,jΦi(X)φj (r) .

(3)

i,j

The trial wave function Ψ1 is used to diagonalize Hexact
giving an energy of E1. The additional functions do not
include any that have the same sub-symmetries as those
comprising Ψ0.

Next, a semi-empirical potential of the form

Vpol =

αd
2r4 (cid:0)1 − exp(−r6/ρ6)(cid:1) ,

(4)

is added to Hexact (αd is the dipole polarizability). This
potential only acts on the scattering projectile. Then
Ψ0 is used to diagonalize Hexact + Vpol giving Epol. The
parameter ρ in eq. (4) is adjusted until Epol = E1. Figure
1 is a schematic diagram outlining this procedure.

In the ﬁnal stage, Ψ0 is modiﬁed to permit φ0(r) to

describe continuum solutions,

Ψcontinuum = Φgs(X)φcontinuum(r) .

(5)

The phase shifts of Hexact + Vpol are then obtained by
using Ψcontinuum as the scattering wave function.

The method is veriﬁed by computing the low energy
phase shifts and annihilation parameters for s-wave e+-H
scattering. The reference wave function, Ψ0, consisted of
the hydrogen atom ground state multiplied by a positron
basis of 30 ℓ = 0 Laguerre type orbitals. The energy and
annihilation rate of Ψ0 are given in Table I.

A sequence of successively larger calculations with J
(the maximum ℓ value of any orbital included in the
basis) were done up to J = 12. The energies at a
given J, hEiJ , and annihilation rates, hΓiJ , are given
in Table I. A major problem aﬀecting CI calculations
of positron-atom interactions is the slow convergence of
the energy with J [5, 6, 15]. One way to determine the
J → ∞ energy, hEi∞, is to make use of an asymptotic
analysis. It has been shown that successive increments,

gies are given in Hartree while spin-averaged annihilation rate

The J → ∞ limits have been determined by ﬁtting sets
of hEiJ values to asymptotic series with either 1, 2 or
3 terms. The linear factors, AE, BE and CE for the 3-
term expansion are determined at a particular J from 4
successive energies (hEiJ−3, hEiJ−2, hEiJ−1 and hEiJ ).
Once the linear factors have been determined it is trivial
to sum the series to ∞ [6, 19, 20] (the J → ∞ limits are
given in Table I).

The trial function Ψ0 was then used to diagonalize the
Hamiltonian with an additional polarization potential
(αd = 4.5 a3
0). The energy from this calculation matches
the 3-term extrapolation in Table I when ρ = 2.0495 a0.
This value of ρ is very close to a value of ρ = 2.051 a0
that was obtained when a polarization potential of this
form was tuned to a very accurate phase shift in a semi-
empirical investigation of e+-H scattering [21]. The phase
shifts obtained by integrating the Schrodinger equation
for the model Hamiltonian with ρ = 2.0495 a0 are de-
picted in Figure 2 and the level of agreement with the
close to exact phase shifts could hardly be better.

Besides obtaining phase shifts, this procedure was used
to determine the annihilation parameter, Zeﬀ.
In this
case the extrapolation to the J → ∞ limits were done
with an asymptotic series similar as eq. (6) but with the
leading order starting as AΓ/(J + 1/2)2. The ratio be-
tween the annihilation rates calculated with Ψ0 and Ψ1
can be equated with the enhancement factor, G, for s-
wave e+-H scattering [21]. The 2-term extrapolation is
chosen for the evaluation of the ratio since lack of com-
pleteness in the ﬁnite dimension radial basis will have a

this choice the enhancement factor becomes G = 5.95,
which is within 1.5% of the enhancement factor chosen
by normalization to a very accurate T -matrix close cou-

not shown, lie within 5% of those of Bhatia et al [24] over

This approach to computing the phase shifts was ap-
plied to the determination of e+-Mg scattering in the
LT = 1 partial wave. The treatment of Mg requires the
use of a frozen core approximation whose details have
been discussed elsewhere [6, 25], so only the briefest de-
scription is given here. The model Hamiltonian is ini-
tially based on a Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function for the
Mg ground state. The core orbitals are then frozen. The
impact of the direct and exchange part of the HF core
interactions on the active particles are computed without
approximation. One- and two-body semi-empirical core-
polarization potentials are then added to the potential.
The adjustable parameters of the core-polarization po-
tential are deﬁned by reference to the spectrum of Mg+
[25].

The e+Mg CI basis was constructed by letting the two
electrons and the positron form all the possible conﬁgu-
ration with a total angular momentum of LT = 1, with
the two electrons in a spin-singlet state, subject to the
selection rules,

max(ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ J ,

min(ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lint ,
(−1)(ℓ0+ℓ1+ℓ2) = −1 .

In these rules ℓ0, ℓ1 and ℓ2 are respectively the orbital
angular momenta of the positron and the two electrons.
The Hamiltonian for the e+Mg 2Po state was diago-

single particle orbitals, including orbitals up to ℓ = 14.
The two electrons were in a spin singlet state. There
was a minimum of 14 radial basis functions for each ℓ.
There were 20 ℓ = 1 positron orbitals. The largest cal-
culation was performed with J = 14 and Lint = 3. The
parameter Lint was set to Lint = 3 since this is mainly
concerned with describing the more quickly converging
electron-electron correlations [25]. The secular equations
were solved with the Davidson algorithm [11].

First, it is necessary to get the Mg ground state energy
in this basis. The limitation Lint = 3 means that only a
single electron in the model atom can have ℓ > 3. Trans-
lating this to an equivalent CI calculation for the Mg
ground state resulted in an energy of of E = −0.83285190
Hartree (energy given relative to the Mg2+ core).

the running estimates of hEi∞ with the J → ∞ extrap-
olations as a function of J. It is clear that none of calcu-
lations indicate the existence of a bound state, but the
energy shift algorithm has to be applied to determine
whether this is due to the ﬁnite basis size.

A polarization potential given by eq. (4) with αd =
72 a3
0 [21, 25] (the Mg ground state polarizability) was
added to original Hamiltonian and ρ was tuned until an
energy shift of 0.003588 (= −0.82886332 + 0.82525710)
Hartree was achieved. Figure 4 shows the elastic cross
section for e+-Mg scattering below the Ps formation
threshold (at k ≈ 0.25 a−1
0 ). The cutoﬀ parameters in
eq. (4) were set to ρ = 3.032 a0 for the s-wave [21] and
ρ = 2.573 a0 (derived here) for all the other partial waves.
The elastic cross section in this energy region is almost
completely dominated by a p-wave shape resonance with
its center near k ≈ 0.10 a−1
0 .

The value of Zeﬀ at the resonance peak was about 1500.
This was determined by using an enhancement factor of
G = 12.5 = 0.3735/0.02983 for valence annihilation. It is
likely that this is an underestimate since a lack of com-
pleteness in the ﬁnite dimension radial basis usually leads
to annihilation rates being too small [6].

To summarize, a novel technique has been used to
demonstrate the existence of a shape resonance in e+Mg
scattering which has the virtue of being readily de-
tectable. The phase shift calculations were performed
using a semi-empirical method [21] with a tuned poten-
tial. The tuning of a semi-empirical optical potential to
features such as bound state energies and resonance po-
sitions is well known. The unique feature of the present
approach is that the optical potential is tuned to the
energy shift of a positive energy pseudo-state. This ap-
proach to the calculation of phase shifts can be applied to

4

other scattering systems which are currently inaccessible
using existing techniques.

The calculations upon the e+Mg system were per-
formed on Linux clusters hosted at the SDSU Compu-
tational Sciences Research Center and the South Aus-
tralian Partnership for Advanced Computing (SAPAC)

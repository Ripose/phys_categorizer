Abstract

The electron aﬃnity of tellurium has been determined to 1.970 876(7) eV. The threshold for photode-
tachment of Te−(2P3/2) forming neutral Te in the ground state was investigated by measuring the total
photodetachment cross section using a collinear laser-ion beam geometry. The electron aﬃnity was
obtained from a ﬁt to the Wigner law in the threshold region.

Introduction

Negative ions are fragile quantum systems, which
diﬀer considerably from neutral atoms and positive
ions in numerous important aspects [1, 2]. Most
prominently the binding energy of the outermost
electron is substantially lower than in iso-electronic
atoms due to the more eﬃcient screening of the nu-
clear charge by the other electrons [3]. This in-
creases the signiﬁcance of correlation eﬀects for the
outermost electrons and makes negative ions a crit-
ical testing ground for atomic theory [4, 5].

The short range potential of negative ions typ-
ically only sustains one bound state [3].
In the
rare cases with more than one bound state they are
of the same parity as the ground state and conse-
quently inaccessible to one-photon electric dipole
transitions. Hence, the electron aﬃnity (EA) is
one of very few properties of a negative ion that
can be determined with high accuracy. The po-
tentially most accurate method to determine EA
is the so called laser photodetachment threshold
(LPT) method [6] in a collinear geometry. In more
recent years we have applied this method to Iodine
[7] to determine the EA and to Chlorine [8] where
we measured both the EA and the isotope shift be-
tween 35Cl− and 37Cl−.

In this paper we investigate the EA of Tellurium.
If comparing with other elements with a relatively

high electron aﬃnity this quantity is determined
with a relatively large uncertainty [3, 9, 10]. The
aim of this work is to achieve an improvement of
this value by using the LPT method in a collinear
geometry.

2 Experiment

2.1 Setup

A collinear laser-ion beam setup, schematically
shown in Fig. 1, was used. The setup is described
in more detail elsewhere [11, 12]. 130Te− ions were
produced in a Cs-sputter ion source and acceler-
ated to an energy of approximately 4 keV. The ions
were subsequently mass-analyzed before entering
the interaction-detection chamber, which was kept
10−9 mbar
under a pressure of approximately 7
10−7 Pa). An electrostatic quadrupole deﬂec-
(7
tor guided the ion beam into the chamber thereby
allowing a collinear laser-ion beam interaction. The
interaction region was deﬁned by two apertures
with a diameter of 3 mm placed 0.5 m apart. A
second electrostatic quadrupole deﬂector separated
ions from atoms after the interaction region and the
ion current was measured in a Faraday cup. The
ion current was typically 1 nA. Atoms created in
the interaction region continued through the sec-

ond electrostatic quadrupole deﬂector and were de-
tected using a neutral-particle detector capable of
detecting single atoms. Only atoms arriving dur-
ing a 6 µs gate after the laser pulse were detected.
This time-gated detection scheme was used to sup-
press the background mainly caused by collisional
detachment. The detector as well as the detection
scheme have been described in detail elsewhere [13].
A tunable dye laser pumped by an excimer laser
and operated with Rhodamine B was used to gen-
erate the laser light. The pulse duration was ap-
proximately 15 ns and the pulse energy used in the
experiment was typically 10µJ. The frequency of
the light was determined by combining Fabry-Perot
fringes and optogalvanic spectroscopy using hollow
cathode lamps.

A new computer program for data acquisition
and laser control by a personal computer (PC) was
developed. The dye laser was controlled via a gen-
eral purpose interface bus (GPIB). The program
allowed scanning of the laser frequency with dif-
ferent step size and diﬀerent number of laser shots
per step within the same scan. The pulses from
a channel electron multiplier (CEM) were counted

by a gated photon counter connected to a PC via a
GPIB. The signals used for calibration were mea-
sured by means of boxcar integrators and transfered
to the computer via A/D converters.

2.2 Procedure

The electron aﬃnity of Te corresponds to the pho-
ton energy needed to reach the ﬁrst threshold for
photodetachment of the Te− ground state, a pro-
cess that can be denoted as

Figure 3: Scan overview: The three curves show the
photodetachment signal, the reference lines (Ne)
and the Fabry-Perot fringes. In the photodetach-
ment signal, the left threshold is obtained with anti-
parallel laser and ion beams and the right threshold
with parallel beams. The background is partly due
to photodetachment of the Te−(5p5 2P1/2) state.
The signal saturates at about 7 counts per laser
pulse. In the vicinity of the calibration lines and the
photodetachment thresholds the step-length was
1 pm and 100 shots per point were taken. Else-
where the step-length was 5 pm and 10 shots per
point were taken. The vertical scale (Counts per
laser pulse) is only valid for the photodetachment
signal.

quency range wide enough to record one identiﬁed
transition in Ar or Ne in the optogalvanic spec-
trum below and one above the two Doppler shifted
thresholds.

A larger frequency step size and a smaller num-
ber of laser pulses were used in the frequency ranges
between the calibration lines and the thresholds
where the only relevant information was the num-
ber of Fabry-Perot fringes to keep track of the rel-
ative frequency scale. In this manner the scanning
time was reduced and hence any long time drifts of
the system were minimized.

3 Results

The result of a typical measurement of the neutral
atom signal, fringes from the Fabry-Perot etalon
and the signal from optogalvanic spectroscopy, us-
ing a hollow cathode lamp is shown in Fig. 3.

they are far above their thresholds. Furthermore,
these signals are relatively small since the sput-
ter ion source predominantly produces ground state
negative ions. The approach in this work was there-
fore to determine the electron aﬃnity by perform-
ing a LPT measurement around the threshold for
the process described by (1), using a collinear laser-
ion beam geometry.

The total photodetachment cross section was ob-
tained by measuring the neutral atom yield as a
function of the laser frequency. To establish the fre-
quency scale, the optogalvanic signal from a hollow
cathode lamp and the fringes from a Fabry-Perot
etalon were recorded simultaneously with the neu-
tral atom signal as the laser frequency was tuned.
The Fabry-Perot fringes served as frequency mark-
ers whereas atomic transitions in Ne [14, 15] or Ar
[16] from two diﬀerent hollow cathode lamps pro-
vided an absolute calibration of the scale. Within
one frequency scan only one hollow cathode lamp
was used, but by performing a number of scans with
each lamp a control of the frequency calibration
was obtained. The direction of the laser beam was
reversed within each scan to obtain the photode-
tachment cross section both for the case of parallel
ion and laser beams, where the photon energy seen
by the ions is red-shifted due to the Doppler shift,
as well as in the case of anti-parallel beams, where
a blue-shift is obtained. Each scan covered a fre-

Two thresholds, both representing photodetach-
ment from the Te−(2P3/2) ground state through the
process described in (1), are seen in the spectrum.
At lower photon energies the laser and ion beams
propagate anti-parallel. The direction of the laser
beam was reversed at a photon energy of about
15 882 cm−1 hence giving a second measurement
of the now blue shifted threshold. By the use of
Ar transitions for the frequency calibration a typi-
cal scanning range was 629.882 nm to 628.022 nm
(15876 cm−1 to 15923 cm−1) and in the case of
Ne transitions the scanning range was 629.564 nm
to 627.746 nm (15884 cm−1 to 15930 cm−1) (the
used reference lines are tabulated in Tab. 2).
In
regions close to optogalvanic signal peaks and pho-
todetachment thresholds the laser wavelength step
was 1 pm and in between, where it only was impor-
tant to keep track of the number of Fabry-Perot
fringes, the step size was increased to 5 pm. In the
vicinity of the photodetachment threshold 100 laser
pulses were used for each frequency step whereas
this number was decreased to 10 in other regions.
To obtain the photodetachment threshold energy
E0 we ﬁtted the Wigner law [17] for s-wave detach-
ment,

to our data by adjusting the parameters: a for the
non-resonant background, b for the cross section
amplitude and Eth for the threshold energy. The
value of the threshold energy parameter is either
blue shifted Eb
0, for parallel laser and ion beams, or
red shifted Er
0 , for anti-parallel laser and ion beams
(Fig. 3 and 4). To attain a threshold energy, E0,
corrected for the Doppler shift to all orders the ge-
ometric mean of the red and blue shifted threshold
energy has to be taken:

The ﬁnal value, E0 = 15 896.18(5) cm−1 is a
weighted average of eight measurements with fre-
quency calibration obtained from Ar transitions
and ten measurements using Ne transitions. Av-
erage values have also been calculated individually
for the sets of E0 values obtained by calibrating to
Ne and Ar transitions respectively. These values
are presented in Tab. 1.

Figure 4: Te(5p4) + ǫs threshold: Measurement
of the relative total photodetachment cross section
around the Te(5p4)+ǫs threshold with anti-parallel
laser and ion beams. The solid line is a ﬁt of the
Wigner law (3) to the experimental data. The error
bars represent the shot noise. Each data point was
acquired during 100 laser pulses. The background
is mainly due to photodetachment of Te−(2P1/2)
through the processes described in (2).

There are two major contributions to the un-
certainty of E0. There is a statistical error of
0.01 cm−1 corresponding to the spread of ﬁtted
threshold values. Second, there is an uncertainty
related to the laser intensity proﬁle. We have es-
timated this uncertainty by analyzing Fabry-Perot
fringes and the atomic reference lines to be less than
0.04 cm−1, which is one ﬁfth of the laser frequency
bandwidth.

To converted our value of E0 from cm−1 to eV
we used the recommended factor of (1/8 065.5410)
[eV/(cm−1)] [18] yielding the value 1.970 876(7) eV
for the EA.

1.970 876(7) eV. The uncertainty is of the same
order of magnitude as the laser bandwidth. We
have thus shown that the background contribution
from photodetachment of Te−(2P1/2) is not critical
for the accuracy achievable with our laser system.
An important part of this experiment was the
use of a computer program that can vary both
the wavelength-step and the acquisition times for

valuable in order to improve the statistics and
simultaneously decrease the total acquisition time,
hence diminishing the probability of long term
drifts. The value we have achieved is of comparable
accuracy as the best EA determinations [2, 3], and
our two independent calibrations add reliability to
this measurement.

This new value of the electron aﬃnity of Tel-
lurium is 45 times more accurate than the value
of Slater [9] and fall well within their error-bars.
The more recent value of Thøgersen [10] agrees with
ours within two error bars.

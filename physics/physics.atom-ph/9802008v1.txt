We model an atomic cavity with a pumping mechanism
and an output coupling to a continuum of external modes.
This system is a schematic description of an atom laser. An
atomic version of the input-output relations is used, and the
eﬀects of the dispersive nature of the external ﬁeld are in-
cluded in the model. The atoms are assumed to be non-
interacting, and we have made the single mode approxima-
tion in the cavity. We develop equations of motion for the
two time correlation of the cavity ﬁeld, and we make a steady
state approximation to simplify these equations. We then de-
scribe a numerical method for solving the resulting complex
valued semi-degenerate Fredholm equation.

I. INTRODUCTION

An atom laser produces a coherent beam of bosonic
atoms. The generation of a monoenergetic source of
atoms requires a very powerful cooling method for the
atoms, and higher order coherences further require that
the pumping mechanism is strongly depleted. A Bose
Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting gas can
satisfy both of these conditions, and a BEC has now been
produced in the laboratory using several diﬀerent atomic
species [1–4]. To convert a BEC into an atom laser, it
must be coupled to the outside world. Several models for
this process have been developed [5–14], and the coher-
ent coupling of a BEC of sodium atoms to an untrapped
state has been achieved experimentally [15]. In this pa-
per, we calculate the dynamics of a pumped and damped
BEC without assuming that the output coupling can be
modelled in the same way as for optical lasers. We dis-
cover that the correct form of the coupling leads to the
possibility of quite diﬀerent dynamics.

Atom laser models have fallen into several categories.
Early models explored the possibilities of extending the
concept of an optical
laser to include the possibility
of producing a coherent source of atomic bosons [5–9].
Atomic traps took over the role of optical cavities. A
continuous cooling mechanism, aided by Bose enhance-
ment, replaced the concept of pumping and stimulated
emission. The ability to produce a BEC in the labo-
ratory was the stimulus for this sudden interest, as it
was suddenly experimentally feasible to reach a param-
eter regime where there is a large number of atoms in
the ground state. The correspondingly large eﬀect due

1

to the Bose enhancement can cause transition rates into
and out of that “lasing mode” dominate the dynamics of
the cavity. The achievement of this regime is necessary
to see laser-like behaviour [16].

The early atom laser models are largely distinguished
by their choice of cooling method, which was either some
form of optical cooling [5,7,8], or evaporative cooling
[6,9]. Evaporative cooling appears to be less appropri-
ate for a continuous process, but it is the only method
which has experimentally reached the quantum degener-
ate regime in BEC experiments. In all of these schemes,
the model for the damping of the cavity was the same
as that used in the master equation for the optical laser.
The resulting equations were therefore very similar to
optical laser equations. This means that they could be
solved using similar methods, and were shown to produce
analogous behaviour. We show here that a correct de-
scription of the output coupling leads to an irreducibly
non-Markovian damping, and can lead to diﬀerent be-
haviour.

In order to produce a better description of the output
coupling in an atom laser, we modelled a speciﬁc output
scheme [14]. In particular, we suggested that the atoms
should be coupled out of the cavity by changing their
state with a Raman transition. This was very similar
to the method employed by the output coupling exper-
iment at MIT, where a radio frequency ﬁeld was used
to change the electronic state of the condensed sodium
atoms so that they were no longer trapped. The Raman
transitions could be achieved by lasers, which would al-
low high intensities and greater spatial control than an
rf ﬁeld. Although the rate equations and the practicali-
ties of the Raman coupling scheme appeared favourable,
it was necessary to produce a more complete theory in
order to describe the eﬀect of using this coupling mech-
anism.

We have recently developed a theory for describing the
output from an atomic cavity connected to an external
ﬁeld [17], which can describe the dynamics of a BEC
which is coupled to the outside world, but is not pumped
by some continuous process. This theory was based on
the optical input-output formalism developed by Gar-
diner and Collett [18], but it was complicated by the
dispersive nature of the atomic ﬁeld as compared to the
linear energy spectrum for optical ﬁelds in free space. A
general solution for the dynamics of the cavity and the
external ﬁelds was presented in terms of Laplace trans-
forms. It was then determined that the output coupling

method based on Raman transitions could be approxi-
mated by a broadband approximation, and an analytical
solution for this case was produced [19].

A complete model of an atom laser must also include
the eﬀect of interatomic interactions and a pumping
mechanism. The eﬀects of atom-atom interactions are in-
cluded implicitly in the output coupling models by Steck
and Naraschewski [21,20], as they describe the ﬁelds us-
ing the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE), which
includes the eﬀect of s-wave scattering.

Models based on the NLSE do not consider the eﬀect
of the coherences between the lasing mode and the ex-
ternal modes, and they assume that the atoms are in a
coherent state of a mode described by some spatial wave-
function. This makes it impossible to describe the eﬀect
of the dynamics of the output coupling on the two time
correlation of the cavity mode, as it is assumed to be
separable into single time expectation values of the ﬁeld.
We present a model of an atom laser which includes
a pumping mechanism and models the output coupling
without making the Markov approximation, which is in-
valid in many physcially relevant parameter regimes. We
have assumed that atom-atom interactions are negligi-
ble. This assumption may not necessarily be valid, in
which case the atom-atom interactions will have to be
included in a more advanced model. The inclusion of the
atom-atom interactions in full generality would be an ex-
ceedingly diﬃcult process. As an illustration of this, we
can see that the energy levels of the cavity would depend
on the number of atoms which were trapped in the cavity.
In the limit of weak interactions, it would be necessary
to add an extra dephasing term to the master equation,
which may also limit the coherence of the output. The
strength of the coupling between the cavity mode and
the external modes depends on the spatial overlap, so it
will become time dependent as the shape of the spatial
wavefunction changes with the intracavity atom number.
A complete description of these eﬀects clearly requires a
multimode description of the intracavity ﬁeld.

Although interactions will clearly complicate the dy-
namics of the atom laser below and around threshold, it
may still be possible to use the single mode approxima-
tion for the cavity after the system has reached a steady
state. At this time, the number of atoms in the cavity
may be reasonably well deﬁned, and the complicated dy-
namics of the pumping process may be approximated by
a linearised master equation term, as may be constructed
for an optical laser [24].

Section II describes our model of a pumped and
damped single mode atomic cavity, and descibes the
method by which we may determine the properties of
the output ﬁeld if we know the dynamics of the mode in
the cavity. Section III shows how the solution may be
generated in terms of inverse Laplace transforms in the
absence of pumping. Section IV derives the equations of
motion for the system in the presence of pumping and
discusses the physics of the various limits of the equa-
tions. We see that we can write the equations of motion

for the intracavity ﬁeld in terms of the intracavity opera-
tors only, but that this leads to non-Markovian equations.
In Sec. V, we make the steady state approximation and
derive a simpliﬁed equation of motion for the system. Us-
ing the appendix, we then outline a method for solving
this equation. Section VI describes the features of the
energy spectrum of the output of an atom laser by ex-
amining the solution of the two time correlation of the
intracavity ﬁeld. In Sec. VII we discuss the possibilities
for improving upon this model.

II. THE MODEL

We model the atom laser by separating it into three
parts. The lasing mode is an atomic cavity with large en-
ergy separation, and when it is operating in the quantum
degenerate regime, it is eﬀectively single mode [8,14]. We
assume that the cavity is single mode, with creation (an-
nihilation) operator a†(a) and a cavity Hamiltonian Hsys.
The external ﬁeld has a diﬀerent electronic state to the
atoms, so the atoms are no longer aﬀected by the trap-
ping potential. We model the external modes as atoms in
free space with a set of creation (annihilation) operators
b†
). The operators a and bk satisfy the normal
k}
{
boson commutation relations. The self energy Hamilto-
nian for the external modes is written Hext, and the cou-
pling between the lasing mode and the external modes
will be governed by the Hamiltonian Hint. The pump
reservoir is coupled to the cavity by an eﬀectively irre-
versible process. At this stage, we will describe the pump
by the Hamiltonian Hpump, which couples the atoms from
a pump reservoir into the system mode.
The total Hamiltonian is then written

modes.

We can then enter the Heisenberg picture and show

This equation also applies to optical ﬁelds, where ωk
takes the photonic form, ωk = ck. In the optical case,
the energy spectrum of the external ﬁeld is often deﬁned
as the Fourier transform of the two time correlation of
the external ﬁeld, which is what is actually measured in
an optical homodyne measurement.

We can produce input-output relations for other inter-
esting properties of the external ﬁeld in a similar fashion.
We simply form the desired expectation value in terms
of the external ﬁeld operators bk and then substitute for
intracavity operators using Eq.(6). This is a simpliﬁed
version of the input-output relations for an atomic cavity.

III. SOLUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF PUMPING

In order to investigate the energy spectrum of the
atoms as they leave the cavity, we must be able to follow
the dynamics of the cavity ﬁeld. When the cavity is not
connected to the pump reservoir, we can use Eq.(6) and
the corresponding equation for ˙a(t) to create a non-local
integal equation for the cavity ﬁeld, a(t):

volving a Raman transition was shown to be equivalent
to the limit in which the shape of the coupling, κ′(k),
becomes inﬁnitely broad [19]. In the same paper, an an-
alytical solution of Eq.(12) in the broadband limit was
presented.

When the model is generalised to include the possibil-
ity of pumping, the individual Heisenberg operators a(t)
in the two time correlation can no longer be calculated, so
the same techniques for ﬁnding a solution do not apply.
In the next section we will derive the equation describing
the two time correlation of the cavity ﬁeld in the presence
of pumping.

IV. EQUATIONS OF MOTION INCLUDING
PUMPING

If the pump reservoir is suﬃciently isolated from the
cavity and external ﬁelds, and the pumping process is
designed to be irreversible, then we may trace over the
reservoir states to produce a master equation for a re-
duced density matrix which describes only the cavity and
the external ﬁelds. One example of a pumping process
which can satisfy these requirements can be found in our
earlier model, where cooled atoms in an excited state are
passed over the trap containing the lasing mode [14]. The
photon emission of the atoms would be stimulated by the
presence of the highly occupied ground state, and they
will make a transition into that state and emit a photon
[22]. For an optically thin sample, which can be made
possible by having a very tight, low dimensional trap, the
photon is unlikely to be reabsorbed, and the process is
eﬀectively irreversible.

After we have traced over the pump modes, we will pro-
duce a term due to the eﬀect of the pump in the master
equation for the reduced density matrix ρ. It is impor-
tant to note that we are not tracing over the output ﬁeld
modes, so our reduced density matrix spans the output
ﬁeld as well as the cavity ﬁeld.

We derive a pumping term based on an approach simi-
lar to that followed by Scully and Lamb [25] and found in
standard Quantum Optics texts [24]. We model pump-
ing by the injection of a Poissonian sequence of excited
atoms into the atom laser. These atoms may sponta-
neously emit a photon and make a transition into the
atom lasing mode. Alternatively, they may make a tran-
sition into other modes of the lasing cavity. For simplic-
ity, we consider an eﬀective two-mode approximation. To
obtain the pumping term, we consider the eﬀect of a sin-
gle atom injected into the atom laser, and then extend
this to describe the eﬀect of a distribution of atoms. This
gives a master equation describing pumping in the num-
ber state basis of the lasing mode ρnm =
. This

equation can be expressed in standard operator notation

This is the same form as presented for a generic master
equation by Wiseman [16] where r is the rate at which
atoms are injected into the cavity, and ns the saturation
number. In our particular model ns depends on the ratio
of the probability that an atom will spontaneously emit
into the lasing mode and the probability the atom will
emit into another mode.

Well above threshold, where the threshold is deﬁned as
the critical pumping rate above which the lasing mode
population will become large compared to the excited
modes in the lasing cavity, this leads to the equation:

This equation is not suﬃcient to specify the dynam-
ics of the cavity, as it is only a single partial integro-
diﬀerential equation in a two dimensional space. We also
require the integro-diﬀerential equation for the intracav-

(16)

This pair of equations are diﬃcult to solve in general,
but may be solved in various limits. For example, if the
kernel f (t) of the integral part of the equation was a
δ-function, then the equations would become local, and
the solution would be a simple exponential. This is the
case in the optical theory, as the coupling κ′(k) can be
assumed to be broadband, and the frequency ωk is pro-
portional to k, so the integral deﬁning f (t) is equivalent
to the Fourier transform of a constant. Although the
broadband limit can be a good approximation for the
atomic case as well [19], the fact that ωk is proportional
to k2 means that the system has an irreducible memory,
and is non-Markovian.

In the broad band limit for κ′(k), we use Eq.(10) to

Although it may be possible in some physical limit, it
is not obvious that we can approximate this kernel as a

δ-function, or make the opposite approximation, that it
is a constant [23]. Either of these approximations may
be valid depending on the exact nature of the solution,
however. If the solution is rapidly decaying to zero, then
the constant kernel approximation may be used. If the
solution is very slowly changing, then it may be removed
from the integral, which is equivalent to approximating
the kernel to be extremely narrow. We may therefore
guess that in the limit of very slow output coupling,
which we would normally associate with a slowly decay-
ing two-time correlation (or a narrow linewidth), the nar-
row kernel approximation may hold, and the output will
be Lorentzian in energy.
In the limit of fast coupling,
we may also ﬁnd a solution based on the constant kernel
approximation. In between these two extremes there will
be hybrid behaviour which may be quite complex.

For a non-pumped cavity with a broadband output
coupling, the long time limit of the output spectrum has
three regimes [17,19]. In the limit of fast coupling, the
energy spectrum looks like the cavity wavefunction which
has appeared in free space. In the limit of very slow cou-
pling, the output approaches a Lorentzian. As the cou-
pling strength is increased from one limit to the other,
there is a reasonably complex behaviour which at ﬁrst
looks like a deformed Lorentzian, and then produces a
fringe-like structure in the spectrum. Eventually, the os-
cillations decay and the spectrum begins to look like the
cavity wavefunction.

With the pumping included, the equations are more
diﬃcult to solve, and at this stage we will not attempt to
solve Eqs(15, 16) directly. Instead, we will make the as-
sumption that the system evolves towards a steady state.
This assumption has in some sense already been made
when we used the linearised pumping term in the master
equation. We will show the self consistency of the steady
state solution later.

V. STEADY STATE

In a continuously pumped and damped atom laser, we
expect the intracavity number to approach a steady state
value, which we should be able to estimate from a set of
rate equations [14]. If we make the further assumption
that the two time correlation also approaches a steady
state, then we may reduce the two dimensional problem
to a one dimensional problem. We assume that

in the limit of large t, where h(0) is now the mean intra-
cavity number, and τ is non-negative. This leads to the

where ˜h(τ ) = ˜h∗(

once we have found the function h(τ ), it is a very simple
calculation to determine the output ﬂux from the atomic
cavity.

Examination of Eq.(19) shows that apart from the
complex conjugate in the second integral, this equation is
a Fredholm equation with a semidegenerate kernel. Sev-
eral numerical methods for solving these equations have
been developed. The most straightforward of these meth-
ods involves the approximation of replacing the integrals
with weighted sums, and then turning the integral equa-
tion into a matrix inversion problem [26]. Unfortunately,
this method turns out to be too unstable numerically
to be applied to a physical situation. A more advanced
method of solution must be used to solve this equation.

A. Method for a numerical solution

The most eﬀective numerical method for solving Fred-
holm integral equations with semidegenerate kernels in-
volves writing the kernel as a sum of separable terms.
The resulting equation can then be converted to the so-
lution of an initial value problem [27]. Although in princi-
ple, we may have to solve a very large number of coupled
diﬀerential equations, the techniques for doing this have
been well developed, and in general the resulting equa-
tions are well behaved. The existence of the complex
conjugate in Eq.(19) means that the standard methods
have to be generalised to solve sets of coupled Fredholm
integral equations. If we separate the real and imaginary
parts of the function h(τ ), then we can rewrite Eq.(19)
as the following equation:

These equations may be converted to an initial value
problem when the kernel may be separated into a ﬁnite
sum of separable matrices. The details of this conversion
are found in the appendix. The appendix also describes
the implementation of this numerical method. Here, we
shall assume that we can solve Eq.(19) numerically, and
produce the steady state atomic ﬂux from Eq.(20).

VI. OUTPUT FROM AN ATOM LASER

In the optical case, where f (t) is proportional to a delta
function, the pumping and damping terms of Eq.(19)
can be collected together, and the equation looks like
the broadband case in Eq.(24) where C = 0 and P is
replaced by a “negative pumping” term which is the dif-
ference between the pumping and the damping terms.
This leads to an exponential solution to the equation,
and therefore a Lorentzian proﬁle to the spectrum. The
atomic case is complicated by the fact that the increase
due to the pumping and the decay of the correlation due
to the damping are not of the same form.

As explained in the Sec.IV, a master equation approach
for ﬁnding the output spectrum will not necessarily be
valid, as the Born and Markov approximations are not
obviously self consistent. We have examined the regimes
of validity of these approximations in other work [23].
In general, a weak output coupling will provide a slowly
decaying two-time correlation, and it is possible to de-
rive a consistent equation using the Markovian approx-
imation. This means that weak coupling will lead to a
Lorentzian output. On the other end of the scale, we
can show that an extremely strong coupling will produce
an output which has the same momentum spread as the
lasing mode [17].

In between these two extremes, we expect hybrid be-
haviour which may exhibit some structure as the spec-
trum changes from the Lorentzian proﬁle. This was ob-
served in the purely damped case [19], and will also be ex-
pected in the pumped case. In Fig. 1 we show the steady

5

state spectrum from an atom laser which has broadband
output coupling. The spectrum is clearly non-Lorentzian,
although it has quite a narrow energy spectrum. The
only free parameters in this spectrum are the cavity en-
ergy ωo, the pumping rate P , and the damping rate C, as
in the equations in the previous section. The calculation
of a spectrum using our model is quite computationally
intensive, and can take several days, but the algorithm is
straighforward and works eﬃciently over a wide variety
of parameter regimes.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that an atom laser cannot be
modelled by Markovian equations except in the weak out-
put coupling limit. For non-interacting atoms, the non-
Markovian equations can be solved analytically in the
limit of zero pumping, as was the case for the pulsed
atom laser [15]. With the approximation that the dy-
namics of a pumped atom laser reaches a steady state,
we have developed a numerical method for calculating
the output spectrum.

Although this model suﬀers from the fact that atom-
atom interactions have not been included, we have
avoided making the approximation that the lasing mode
is perfectly coherent, which is implied by atom laser mod-
els which involve nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations based
on mean ﬁeld theory. Future work will involve generalis-
ing this atom laser model to include interactions without
making an initial mean ﬁeld approximation. This will
allow us to determine the limitations on the coherence
of a practical atom laser, and thus the limits on their
interferometric applications.

APPENDIX A: NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF A
SET OF FREDHOLM EQUATIONS

The method presented here is an extension of a method
which solves a Fredholm integral equation with a semide-
generate kernel to a method which solves a set of these
equations which are coupled.

Let us consider the extended family of equations:

hi(τ, X) = gi(τ ) +

dy κij (t, y) hj(y, X)

V

X

0
j=1 Z
X

of two values, corresponding to the real and imaginary
parts of the complex valued equation. The steady state
limit in this paper is the limiting function in this family
as X
. If there is non-trivial behaviour in this limit,
then the validity of our steady state approximation may
be questioned.

We now make the following approximation for the form

of the kernel:

where αik
p are complex valued functions
which may be chosen to approximate the exact kernel as
closely as possible. We can see that the kernel is discon-
tinuous at y = t, and has a diﬀerent expansion in terms
of a ﬁnite sum of separable matrices on either side of
the discontinuity. This approximation is not as strong as
it ﬁrst appears, as any function of two variables which
can be well approximated by a truncated power series
in the two variables can be written in this manner. For
any particular kernel, there may be many decompositions
into matrices of this form.

We now take the partial derivative of hi(t, X) with
respect to X, and introduce the function Φij(t, X), which
is the solution of the equation

Φij (t, X) = κij(t, X) +

In a now familiar process, we take the partial deriva-
tives of the functions r with respect to X and generate
a new equation of motion. The diﬀerence is that after
using the above deﬁnitions, we can write this diﬀeren-
tial equation as a closed system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations:

(A10)

where
rf j
mn(0) = 0.

(A11)

These equations form a Riccati system of 4M N ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations, from which, with Eq.(A5)
and Eq.(A6), we can solve for the functions J ij
n (t, X)
for any values of the two variables. This also allows us
to generate the functions Φij(t, X). The solution of the
original family of equations requires us to be able to ﬁnd
hi(X, X). We now gaily introduce the new set of func-
tions ef

m(X):

m(X) =

dy βf k

which can be substituted into Eq.(A1) with t = X, to
produce the result

hj(X, X) = gj(X) +

m (X)ef

m(X).

(A13)

We then ﬁnd derivatives ∂X ef

m(X), and use our pre-
vious results to express the right hand side in terms of
known functions. We ﬁnd that

∂X ef

m(X) =

These equations may be solved simultaneously with
Eq.(A10), which produces a set of 2M (2N + 1) simulta-
neous ordinary diﬀerential equations. From these equa-
tions, we can produce J ij
n (t, t) and hj(t, t), which we can
then use to produce initial values in Eq(A6) and Eq.(A3).
We then adjoin these extra diﬀerential equations and in-
tegrate to our desired value of X. We have then found the
values of our set of functions hi(t, X) for a single value of
both t and X. Subsequent integrations can produce other
values of our function. Examples of this procedure for the
one component version are found in reference [27], and
the generalisation to this procedure should be straight-
forward.

It is possible to reduce the amount of time taken to
compute the function hi(t, X) by branching oﬀ with ex-
tra diﬀerential equations for multiple values of t within
the one computation. This rapidly increases the number
of diﬀerential equations which must be solved simultane-
ously, and therefore increases the memory requirements.
If P points are to be found simultaneously, then up to
(2M + 2P )(2N + 1) equations must be integrated.

In order to solve Eq.(21), we must write the kernel
in the form of Eq.(A1). This can be done in several
ways, and we choose our decomposition to minimise the
impact of increasingly higher order terms, and to avoid
any singularities.

The simplest regime is where t

X, where the
kernel depends only on κ(2)(t, y), which was deﬁned in
Eq.(23). We expand this function

recurrence relation g(n) = (1/2 + n

where we have supressed the i and j indices on the func-

without aﬀecting the dynamics.

respect to the addition of higher order terms.

FIG. 1.

This ﬁgure shows the spectrum of the output
ﬂux from a steady state atom laser satisfying Eq.(19) with a
broadband output coupling deﬁned by Eq.(23). It uses the
parameters P = 0.02ωo and C = 0.1s−1/2ωo. We see that the
spectrum deviates from a purely Lorentzian proﬁle.

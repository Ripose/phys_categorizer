We investigate the dynamics of an atom optical realization of the quantum δ-kicked accelerator. We place
cesium atoms in an equal superposition of two internal states for which the kick strengths applied to an initial
motional state differ, and measure the overlap of the resulting states using a Ramsey-type experiment. We
observe interference, showing quantum accelerator modes to be formed coherently, with a (Peres) quantum-
stable evolution [A. Peres, Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht,
1993)]. We analyze numerically the dependence of the overlap on kick strength, determining the effect of
averaging over its experimental range, and the regime of accelerator mode stability. This stability relates to
stable regions in a pseudoclassical, rather than classical, phase space.

The relationship between the behaviour of classical and
quantum systems, and how macroscopic classical phenomena
originate in the quantum regime, remain subjects of dispute
[1]. The issues involved are particularly marked when con-
sidering classically chaotic systems. Analogous quantum me-
chanical systems do not appear to exhibit chaotic behaviour,
i.e., long-term aperiodic behaviour that depends very sensi-
tively on the initial state [2, 3]. Reconciliation of this apparent
discrepancy is the goal of many current investigations [4]. In
this Letter we discuss phenomena of the quantum δ-kicked ac-
celerator [5, 6, 7], a quantum δ-kicked rotor with an additional
static linear potential. The δ-kicked rotor is one of the most
extensively investigated systems in chaotic dynamics [8, 9],
and is equivalent to a free particle subjected periodically to
instantaneous kicks from a sinusoidal potential. Atom-optical
realizations of δ-kicked particles have achieved breakthrough
successes in recent years, particularly in observing dynami-
cal localization and quantum resonances [2, 10]. Quantum
mechanically, the effect of instantaneous application of a si-
nusoidal potential is to diffract the particles’ constituent de
Broglie waves into a series of discretely spaced momentum
states. In the δ-kicked accelerator, the additional linear po-
tential modiﬁes the classical dynamics only slightly, yet can
radically change the quantum behaviour. The phases accumu-
lated between consecutive kicks by the momentum states are
altered, leading to the creation of quantum accelerator modes
[5, 6, 7]. Such modes are characterized by a momentum trans-
20%)
fer, linear with kick number, to a substantial fraction (
of a typical initial distribution of particles. This behaviour is
not observed in the analogous classical system.

∼

We realize the quantum δ-kicked accelerator through the
application of short pulses of a vertical standing wave of off-
resonant light to laser-cooled cesium atoms, and perform a
variant of the Ramsey separated oscillatory ﬁelds experiment
[11, 12]. The standing wave constitutes the sinusoidal po-
tential, and the linear potential is provided by gravity, so that
quantum accelerator modes are created. Since a quantum ac-
celerator mode involves a large momentum transfer to a sig-
niﬁcant proportion of the atoms, it promises applications in

atom interferometry, which requires the preservation of co-
herence. Observation of Ramsey interference in accelerated
atoms would conﬁrm this coherence. Moreover, the contrast
of any interference fringes is related to the overlap of two
states which have evolved from the same initial motional state
under the inﬂuence of slightly different Hamiltonians. This is
overlap parameter ﬁrst proposed by Peres [9] in order to quan-
titatively study quantum stability, and so the contrast yields
information on the sensitivity of the atoms’ evolution to vari-
ations in the strength of the kicking potential. This can be
linked to stability in phase space and hence used to investi-
gate quantum-classical correspondence [4, 9, 12].

rectly implies coherent evolution, where the contrast is linked
to the stability characteristics of a pseudoclassical phase space
[9, 13].

thus have effectively two different Hamiltonians, applied to
the same initial motional state. The pulse train leads to the cre-
ation of a quantum accelerator mode, the momentum of which
is the same for the two internal states [6]. In studying the co-
herence of accelerator mode evolution, we investigate our sys-
tem’s sensitivity to variations in the Hamiltonian [9, 12]. In
this Letter we consider pulse periods T = 60.5µs and 74.5µs,
close to the half-Talbot time T1/2 = 2πm/¯hG2 = 66.7µs,
which corresponds to the lowest second-order quantum res-
onance in the δ-kicked rotor [7, 10]. For these T , well-
populated accelerator modes involving substantial momentum
transfer are created [5, 6, 7].

Figure 1(a) shows the measured momentum distribution of
F = 4 atoms, after 20 pulses with T = 60.5µs. We see a
period-2π variation with θ in the accelerator mode population,
2)% [14]. We observe fringes
the visibility V of which is (21
for a range of detunings (δe
L = 20–40 GHz) and total number
of kicks N = 10–30, though, depending on their values, V
can vary between 10% and 40%. This periodic variation of
the population demonstrates that the accelerator mode trans-
fers momentum coherently. At T = 74.5µs [Fig. 1(b)], how-
ever, fringes in the accelerator mode are not visible, despite
the expected coherent nature of the momentum transfer. In
Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) numerical simulations based on a diffrac-
tive model of the potential’s effect [5, 6, 7], which incorpo-
rate the experimental range of φd (0.3π to 1.2π), also show
this difference in the fringe visibility for the two values of T .
The range of φd is due to the Gaussian proﬁle of the stand-
ing wave intensity (FWHM
1 mm) and the spatial extent
∼
of the atomic cloud (Gaussian density distribution, FWHM
1 mm) [7]. As we optimized the overlap of the laser beams
∼
with the atomic cloud, intensity and density maxima can be
assumed to be coincident. The calculated visibility is then
25% for T = 60.5µs [Fig. 1(c)] but only 8% for T = 74.5µs
[Fig. 1(d)].

In order to explain these observations, we put our descrip-

tion describing the proportion of atoms experiencing a partic-
ular φd. Although for a single value of φd the visibility of the
fringes at both T = 60.5µs and T = 74.5µs is high, Figs. 2(a)
and 2(d) show that integration over the experimental range of
φd causes a greater reduction in visibility at T = 74.5µs than
at T = 60.5µs. At large φd, there is a general breakdown of
all structure in plots of cos(φI + N δφd). By comparing with
Figs. 2(b) and 2(e), where A is plotted as a function of p and
φd, this can be seen to coincide with a falloff in the value of
A. Note, however, that as φI is determined numerically from
complex interference terms, one should be careful about at-
taching physical signiﬁcance to values of cos(φI + N δφd) for
which the corresponding value of A is close to zero.

Figures 2(b) and 2(e) show that the region in momentum
space corresponding to an accelerator mode is also a region
of high A, which remains high up to large values of φd [16],
continuing beyond the point at which it has decayed to nearly
zero in other regions of momentum space. As A is related to
Peres’s stability parameter O [9], this implies that atoms in
an accelerator mode inhabit a stable region of quantum state
space. Note that small A does not imply low atomic popula-
tion, as can be seen in the plots of the non-interfering popula-
2) in Figs. 2(c) and 2(f). Contrast-
tion
ing Fig. 2(b) with Fig. 2(e), we see that this large value of A
extends over a signiﬁcantly wider range of φd for T = 60.5µs
than for T = 74.5µs. Hence, we can interpret the accelerator
mode at T = 60.5µs as being more robust, i.e. more stable,
compared with that at T = 74.5µs.

Eq. (3) and we have introduced ˜ρ = ρǫ/k (in an accelerat-

. Stable islands correspond to
ǫ
|
quantum accelerator modes, the population of which is pro-
portional to the size of the island [13]; in the classical limit,
the system is globally chaotic for our parameter regime. Note
that the pseudoclassical islands are located near the point of
zero light shift at T = 60.5µs, and near the maximum for
T = 74.5µs, which is consistent with the numerically ob-
served region of spatial localization in the quantum system
[15]. Figure 3 shows the pseudoclassical phase spaces gen-
erated by iteration of Eqs. (5) and (6) for the experimentally

around a stable ﬁxed point in phase space) is substantially
smaller for T = 74.5µs than for T = 60.5µs. For the av-
erage experimental value of φd (0.8π) [Figs. 3(b) and 3(e)],
the islands have both grown to be about the same size. For
φd = 1.5π [Figs. 3(c) and 3(f)], the island has shrunk dramat-
ically in the case of T = 74.5µs, while at T = 60.5µs the

eter [9].

In Figs. 2(a) and 2(d), cos(φI + N δφd) is plotted as a func-
tion of p and φd for T = 60.5µs and T = 74.5µs, respec-
tively. In both cases its variation with φd is quite different
for the momenta at which accelerator modes are found, com-
pared to all other momenta. This can be accounted for by the
different regions of the accelerator mode’s spatial localization
for the two values of T . At T = 60.5µs this is found close
to the zeros of the light shift, whereas at T = 74.5µs it is
close to the maxima [15]. This means that at T = 60.5µs the
value of cos(φI + N δφd) is almost independent of φd in the
17¯hG after 20
region of the accelerator mode momentum (
kicks), while at T = 74.5µs the effect is an approximate fre-
quency doubling at the accelerator mode momentum (20¯hG).
We can now explain the differences in fringe visibility for the
two values of T by considering the experimental range of φd.
As Eq. (4) determines the population for one speciﬁc value
of φd only, the observable momentum distribution is given by
dφdD(φd)Pb(φd, p), where D(φd) is a distribu-

periodicities in terms of the different position of the accelera-
tor modes’ spatial localization and the experimental range of
kicking strengths. We have also found the accelerator modes
to correspond to regions of greater quantum stability, as quan-
tiﬁed by the Peres overlap parameter. This is consistent with
the behaviour of regions of stability in the dynamics of a re-
cently proposed pseudoclassical limit of the δ-kicked accel-
erator. These are found in the same position as the spatial
localization of the quantum accelerator modes. We have thus
carried out an actual measurement of the quantum stability of
this classically chaotic system.

fore conclude that the stable island representing the accelera-
tor mode is much more robust to perturbations in the kicking
strength for T = 60.5µs than for T = 74.5µs. The fact that
A remains large for a signiﬁcantly broader range of φd when
T = 60.5µs than for when T = 74.5µs matches exactly the
observed greater stability of the island in the pseudoclassical
phase space for T = 60.5µs. This is in accordance with what
one would expect from Peres’s stability criterion [9]. This has
implications for quantum-classical correspondence as mani-
fested in the dynamics of a quantum system whose classical
analog is chaotic.

In summary, we have performed a Ramsey-type interfer-
ence experiment to demonstrate the coherence of the pro-
cess by which a quantum accelerator mode is produced. We
have explained a discrepancy in the appearance of interfer-
ence fringes for accelerator modes created by different pulse

Abstract
Using the variational method, a detailed study of the lowest m = 0, −1 electronic states of the
exotic molecular ion H 3+
in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, in the linear symmetric conﬁguration parallel
to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is carried out. A extended study of the 1σg ground state (J.C.
L´opez and A. Turbiner, Phys. Rev. A 62, 022510, 2000) was performed obtaining that the potential
energy curve displays a suﬃciently deep minimum for ﬁnite internuclear distances, indicating the

possible existence of the molecular ion H 3+
is demonstrated that the excited state 1πu can exist for a magnetic ﬁeld B = 4.414 × 1013 G
corresponding to the limit of applicability of the non-relativistic theory.

INTRODUCTION

The neutron stars were predicted by L. Landau [1] in
1932. This kind of stars are characterized by an enor-
mous magnetic ﬁeld (B ∼ 1012 G −1013 G). Since the
discovery of neutron stars in 1967 the behavior of the
molecular and atomic systems in such strong magnetic
ﬁeld has been object of intense investigations. The ﬁrst
studies were made in plasma physics and astrophysics by
Kadomstev-Kudrayavstev [2] and Ruderman [3], respec-
tively. The results demonstrated that the binding energy
of a molecular system grows substantially with magnetic
ﬁeld increase, while the size of the systems decreases.
As a consequence of such a behavior, the formation of
a molecular chain aligned in the magnetic ﬁeld direction
arise.

Recent studies of the Coulomb systems in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld have been encouraged by the observation
of the neutron star 1E1207.4-5209 (Chandra X-ray obser-
vatory 2002). These observations displayed two absorp-
tion features at 0.7 keV and 1.4 keV. The origin of such
lines could be associate to the presence of exotic molec-
ular systems in the atmosphere of the above mentioned
star [4]. In particular, the studies of one-electron molecu-
lar systems, traditional and exotic have been intensiﬁed,
such as H +
(see for
example [5]).

The focus of this article is a quantitative analysis of
the lowest electronic states of the molecular system H 3+
placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The variational method
in the framework of non-relativistic theory is used, i.e.
B ≤ 4.414 × 1013 G (Schwinger limit). Speciﬁcally, an
extension of the preliminary study [6] for the ground
state is made, and the possible existence of excited states
is carried out.

Atomic units are used throughout (~ = e = me = 1)
and the energy is expressed in Rydbergs (Ry). Spectro-
scopic convention is used to denote the states. A num-
ber indicates the principal quantum number, Greek let-

ter σ, π, δ . . . indicate the magnetic quantum number for
|m| = 0, 1, 2 . . . respectively. The spatial parity is deﬁned
by g (gerade) for states with even parity and u (unger-
ade) for odd parity states. Particularly, the ground state
is indicated as 1σg.

II. THE MOLECULAR ION H 3+

4

4

The exotic molecular ion H 3+

is a system constituted
by four protons and one electron. For the present work
the protons are consider over a straight line (linear conﬁg-
uration) parallel to the lines of magnetic ﬁeld B (parallel
conﬁguration). The magnetic ﬁeld B is taken as constant
and homogeneous in z direction. The Born-Oppenheimer
approximation of zero order is assumed (protons are con-
sider inﬁnitely massive). The positions of the four pro-
tons over z axis are denoted as R1, R2, −R3 and −R4.
We will suppose also that R1 = R3 and R2 = R4 (sym-
metric conﬁguration (see Fig.1)).

In order to describe the magnetic ﬁeld B = (0, 0, B),
in the symmetric gauge A =
the vector potential
B
2 (−y, x, 0) is assumed. The Hamiltonian that describes
the molecular ion H 3+

(in cylindrical coordinates) is

4

ˆH = −∆ + ˆlzB +

B2ρ2

+ V (ρ, z) ,

(1)

where ρ2 = x2 + y2 is the distance from the electron to
the z axis. ˆlz is the z component of the angular mo-
ment (which is a integral of motion with eigenvalue m
-magnetic quantum number). V (ρ, z) is the Coulomb po-
tential of the interaction between the electron and each
charged center, plus the classic repulsion term between

2

In addition, since the charged centers (protons) are
identical, the trial function is chosen symmetric with re-
spect to the interchange of these, i.e., invariant under
transformations Pij (ri ↔ rj), i, j = 1 . . . 4.

The trial function is a linear combination of terms that
fulﬁll the requirements above mentioned. The general

In the Hamiltonian (1) the spin contribution is ne-
glected because it only changes a reference level for the
total energy.

III. THE TRIAL FUNCTIONS

4

In order to study the system H 3+

the variational
method is used. For the choosing of the trial functions,
the ﬁtting criteria used by Turbiner-L´opez was followed
(see for example [5]). These criteria have proved to give
much precise results, qualitatively and quantitatively, for
diﬀerent Coulomb systems in strong magnetic ﬁelds. Ba-
sically these are:

1.- The potential Vt = ∆ψt
ψt

, for which the trial function
ψt is an exact eigenfunction of ˆHt = −∆ + Vt, with
zero energy, should reproduce the original potential
near the Coulomb singularities and the harmonic
oscillator behavior at large distances.

2.- The symmetries of the system must be included.

3.- For the ground state, the trial function should not
vanish inside the domain where the problem is de-
ﬁned(Theorem of Perron).

Here Ψ0 corresponds to the general trial function for the
ground state (m = 0). α1,2,3,4 and β are variational
parameters. The sum is over all permutations of the
parameters α1,2,3,4. Excitations for diﬀerent values of
the magnetic quantum number m are included with the
Um term. The trial functions Ψm given by Eq. (3) cor-
responding to diﬀerent values of m are orthogonal and
result suitable to describe the lowest states inside each
family of own states with quantum number m deﬁned.

A. Gauge Rotation

Considering the trial function Ψm given by Eq. (3) and
the Hamiltonian ˆH (see Eq. (1)), the total energy (for a
state with a quantum magnetic number m) is

ETvar =

is the gauge rotated Hamiltonian, and ˆpm ≡ U −1
m ˆp Um is
the covariant moment . From here on, ETvar will denote
simply as ET . This formulation is very suitable since
each Hamiltonian ˆhm (for m constant) describes a family
of eigenstates with the quantum number m.

Moreover, the ground state and the excited states are
described by trial functions which have the same struc-
ture (given by the function (4a)). The only diﬀerence
appears as a weight factor ρ2|m|.

tential (9) exactly reproduces the original potentials of
Coulomb for α1 = α2 = α3 = α4 = 1, and of harmonic
oscillator for β = 1.

IV. TRIAL FUNCTION TERMS Ψp

The election of the most general trial function Ψ0
(Eq. (4a)) was in no way arbitrary. The α parameters
may be interpreted as the eﬀective charge of the protons
and β parameter as the eﬀective coupling of the electron
with magnetic ﬁeld B. With this characterization of the
variational parameters, it is possible obtain diﬀerent trial
functions each one with certain physical interpretation.
Let us consider for example the case in which the in-
teraction of the electron with each one of the protons is
coherent. That is, the electron interacts in the same way
with each proton. To describe such physical situation,
it is enough to take α1 = α2 = α3 = α4 ≡ α1 in the
Eq. (4a). Deﬁning this function as ψ(1)
the following is
obtained

0

0 = e−α1(r1+r2+r3+r4) e−β1

This function is the Heitler-London type function (used
to describe the system H +
2 without magnetic ﬁeld) mul-
tiplied by the lowest Landau orbital. The results of the
calculus verify (a posteriori) that this function gives the
major contribution in the description of the system near
its equilibrium position.

In order to describe the physical situation at large in-
ternuclear distances, all α′s parameters are equal to zero,
except one, which is denote as α2. The trial function is

which corresponds to a Hund-Mulliken type function
(used to describe the system H +
2 without magnetic ﬁeld)
multiplied by the lowest Landau orbital. This function
describes the interaction of the electron with each of the
protons independently (incoherent interaction).

It is now clear that diﬀerent degenerations from the
general function (Eq. (4a)) lead to diﬀerent physical de-
scriptions of the system, and therefore to several trial
functions. In this case and in order not to discriminate
between one and another of the diﬀerent descriptions, the
linear combination of all the possible particular cases was
considered as trial function. Explicitly, the trial function
used in the current study is

Ψt = A1ψ(1)

ysis of each term appears in [7].

Another degeneration of the Eq. (4a) happens when
α’s parameters are equal by pairs, α1 = α2 = α; α3 =
α4 = α′, (α 6= α′). The physical picture correspond to
an electron shared by two protons of diﬀerent form. The
situation may be interpreted as an interaction H +
2 + H +
2
between two Hydrogen molecular ions, even though of
course we only have one electron (these type of physical
interpretations are denoted between quotation marks on
Table I). In the same way, in the most general case (all
α’s parameters are diﬀerent), the corresponding function
is a sum of products of four Hydrogen functions by one
Landau function (see Eq. (4a)). This situation describes

a mixed state of four Hydrogen atoms sharing only one
electron.

Along with the A1,...,11 coeﬃcients of the linear com-
bination (Eq. (10)) and the positions R1,...,4 (see Fig. 1)
there is a total of 48 variational parameters. The normal-
ization condition of the trial function allows to keep one
of the A coeﬃcients as constant. The symmetry restric-
tion (R3 = R1, R4 = R2) ﬁxes two parameters. Finally
the number of eﬀective variational parameters is reduced
to 45.

Each step in a particular minimization consists in keep-
ing some parameters as constant while others were varied.
The election of which parameters must be kept constant
and which free was always based on the physical inter-
pretation of such parameters. In no way the calculation
is automatic, rather, a sophisticated artisan treatment is
required. With this procedure, a variational parameter
conﬁguration was obtained in which the systems total
energy value is minimum. Each minimization procedure
for a given magnetic ﬁeld as a general statement took
various months of calculations (see [7]).

V. COMPUTER TECHNIQUE

All calculations were made in a DELL PC with two
Xeon processors of 2.8 GHz each. For minimization
calculations the minimization routine MINUIT of the
CERN-LIB library was used. Numerical integration is
carried out using the routine D01FCF from the NAG-LIB
library. The relative precision in the numerical integra-
tion was of 10−11. It is important to mention that once
all variational parameters are determined, the calculation
of the variational energy takes a few seconds.

A. Minimization Strategy

The variational energy calculation includes two techni-
cal aspects: the numerical evaluation of integrals in two
dimensions and minimization of energy with respect to
the variational parameters. The objective in the mini-
mization process is to ﬁnd a point in the multidimen-
sional parametric space that minimizes the total energy
of the system (Eq. (5)). Since we have 45 variational
parameters, the search of the minimum is a formidable,
complicated and tedious task. For this reason it is not a
good idea to start the procedure making a minimization
in which all parameters vary simultaneously. The strat-
egy used consisted in making minimization sequences in
the following way

• Ansatz by Ansatz, knowing clearly that between
the eleven terms that appear in the Eq. (10), the
most general ψ(11)
should give us the best (lowest)
value in total energy.

p0

• Combinations of two by two As¨antze, taking ψ11
the common Ansatz to all these combinations.

p0 as

• Some combinations of three by three Ans¨atze, tak-
ing as ground the previous combinations, where one
more Ansatz was included.

VI. RESULTS

In this section the total energy ET , the binding en-
ergy [12] Eb (Eb ≡ B −ET ), and the equilibrium distance
of protons (R3 = R1, R4 = R2) for the ground state 1σg
and the excited state 1πu of the molecular ion H 3+
are
presented. The trial function used is shown in Eq. (10).
For a comparison with the results obtained by Turbiner-
L´opez [13] the calculations were carried out considering
two diﬀerent conversion factors to atomic units. These
factors are B0 = 2.35 × 109 G (the one adopted in this
work) and B0 = 2.3505 × 109 G ( the one adopted in [6]).

A. The Ground State 1σg

For the ground state 1σg each Ansatz presents a mini-
mum in the energy curve for the ﬁnite parameter values
R1,...,4. In Table II the results are present. The results
carried out by Turbiner-L´opez [6] (also present in Table
II) only consider the four terms that appear in Table I.
A total energy curve of the system as function of R2
was obtained (see Fig. 2). For this the parameter R1
is considered constant to the corresponding value of the
minimum total energy conﬁguration (in symmetric con-
ﬁguration). The R3 and R4 parameters are now con-
In other words the
sidered as variational parameters.
symmetry restriction is eliminated. The curve presents a
well deﬁned minimum for ﬁnite internuclear distances in
the symmetric conﬁguration. The height of the barrier is
∆E ≡ Emax − Emin = 0.242 Ry. The asymptotic behav-
ior of this curve for large R2 shows that R1 +R3 ≈ 0.1113
(see Fig. 1) and R4 − R3 ≈ 0.1110. These values are very
similar to the equilibrium distances of the ion H 2+
(see
3
Table IV). This indicates that a decay H 3+
4 → H 2+
3 + p
is possible. The energy as function of R1, R2, R3 and R4,
generates a surface. In particular the curve presented in
Fig. 2 corresponds to the cut throughout the valley of
this surface.

• Beginning from that combination of three Ans¨atze
with the best total energy value, new Ans¨atze were
incorporated until there was a total of eleven of
them.

The electronic distribution corresponding to ground
state 1σg is shown in Fig. 3. We can observed that the
electronic cloud is mainly concentrated around the inter-
mediate point to the protons.

B. The Excited State 1πu

The calculations were made for the two values of the
conversion factor B0 and it is shown in Table III. Also
for this state, each Ansatz presents a minimum in the
energy curve for the ﬁnite parameter values R1,...,4.

For the excited state 1πu the electronic distribution is
shown in Fig. 4. The positions of the protons are indi-
cated by points in the plane (x, z). The fact that appar-
ently there are only three points present and not four, it
is due to the fact that the distances between the inter-
nal protons is very small in comparison with the whole
dimension of the system (see Table III). This electronic
distribution presents seven maximums (Fig. 4(b)) located
in neighboring regions to the protons. From these, those
that surround internal protons (see Fig. 1) are ∼ 108
times more pronounced that the minors of them. A
comparison of the total energy and the equilibrium dis-
tances [14] between molecular ions H 3+
2 , both
for the excited state 1πu, shows that both are very simi-
lar (see Table IV), indicating that H 3+
2 + 2p could
be a possible channel of decay of the molecular system
H 3+
4 . If a comparison of the total energy of the systems

4 → H +

and H 3+

H 3+
and H 2+
is carry out (Table IV), we found that
4
3
the molecular ion H 3+
could have a possible channel of
3 + p. Among the systems H, H +
decay H 3+
2 ,
H 2+
4 , the ﬁrst of them, H, results as the one
3
with the greatest total energy in the rank of the mag-
netic ﬁelds 0 − 4.414 × 1013 G, for which a possible decay
H 3+

4 → H + 3p is discarded.
Finally, it is important to mention that if we relax the
symmetry conditions (R1,...,4 are arbitrary) in the mini-
mization, the system returns to the symmetric conﬁgu-
ration. This is fulﬁlled for the ground state (m = 0) and
for the excited state (m = −1).

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Applying the variational method, a detailed study of
the 1σg and 1πu electronic states of the exotic molecu-
lar ion H 3+
in a strong magnetic ﬁeld was carried out.
The magnetic ﬁeld B, was considered to be constant and
homogeneous.

states. All of them in linear, symmetric and parallel conﬁgu-
ration in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld B = 4.414 × 1013 G
(B0 = 2.35 × 109 G). In H 2+
the equilibrium distance Req
corresponds to the distance between to adjacent protons. For
the system H 3+
this was considered as the separation between
the two internal protons Req = 2R1 (see Fig. 1).

A. Ground State 1σg

An improvement in the variational energy of ∼ 0.2%
was obtained in comparison with the ﬁrst calculations

presents in the literature (Turbiner-L´opez). The equilib-
rium distances in both case are very similar. This in the
symmetric conﬁguration. An important remark is that
the system H 3+
can already exist for a magnetic ﬁeld of
4
intensity B = 3 × 1013 G.

B. Excited State 1πu

The existence of the excited state of the molecular ion
H 3+
in a magnetic ﬁeld B = 4.414 × 1013 G is seem pos-
4
sible. This state presents a peculiarity in its equilibrium
distances (see Table III). R2 turns out to be ∼ 80 times
R1. The fact that the total energy of the molecular ions
H 3+
4 , H 2+
2 is very similar, indicates that the ion
3
H 3+
is very unstable in this state. In this sense it is very
4
unstable since any small disturbance could originate a
decay. For which the existence of other excited states
does not seem possible, at least for this magnetic ﬁeld
value.

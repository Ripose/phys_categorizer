We propose a dipole-force linear waveguide which con-
ﬁnes neutral atoms up to λ/2 above a microfabricated single-
mode dielectric optical guide. The optical guide carries far
blue-detuned light in the horizontally-polarized TE mode and
far red-detuned light in the vertically-polarized TM mode,
with both modes close to optical cut-oﬀ. A trapping min-
imum in the transverse plane is formed above the optical
guide due to the diﬀering evanescent decay lengths of the
two modes. This design allows manufacture of mechanically
stable atom-optical elements on a substrate. We calculate the
full vector bound modes for an arbitrary guide shape using
two-dimensional non-uniform ﬁnite elements in the frequency-
domain, allowing us to optimize atom waveguide properties.
We ﬁnd that a rectangular optical guide of 0.8 µm by 0.2 µm
carrying 6 mW of total laser power (detuning ±15 nm about
the D2 line) gives a trap depth of 200 µK for cesium atoms
(mF = 0), transverse oscillation frequencies of fx = 40 kHz
and fy = 160 kHz, collection area ∼ 1 µm2 and coherence
time of 9 ms. We discuss the eﬀects of non-zero mF , surface
interactions, heating rate, the substrate refractive index, and
the limits on waveguide bending radius.

There has been much recent progress in the trapping
and cooling of neutral atoms, opening up new areas of
ultra-low energy and matter-wave physics [1]. Waveg-
uides for such atoms are of great interest for atom op-
tics, atom interferometery, and atom lithography. Mul-
timode atom waveguides act as incoherent atom pipes
that could trap atoms, transport them along complicated
paths or between diﬀerent environments, or deliver highly
localized atom beams to a surface. Single-mode waveg-
uides (or multimode guides populated only by atoms in
the transverse ground-state) could be used for coherent
atom optics and interferometry [9,7], as well as a tool
for one-dimensional physics such as boson-fermion dual-
ity [6,22,23] and low-dimensional Bose-Einstein conden-
sation eﬀects [24].

The optical dipole-force has long been used to trap and
manipulate atoms [1] as well as dielectric particles [3].
The available intensity of lasers has allowed a multitude
of such atom traps in the far-detuned regime, giving very
low decoherence and heating rates, and storage times on
the order of seconds [2].

Evanescent light waves have been popular in many
atom mirrors, traps and guides [10,11] since they can pro-
vide potentials with high spatial gradients (decay lengths
∼ λ/2π where λ is the optical wavelength), and use rigid
dielectric structures (prisms, ﬁbers) to deﬁne the poten-

tial shape. For example, there has been a series of repul-
sive (blue-detuned) evanescent-wave (EW) traps which
rely on gravity to provide the counteracting force [12] and
recent experiments have shown that hollow optical ﬁbers
can guide atoms conﬁned within the hollow core using a
repulsive evanescent ﬁeld guided by the ﬁber [19,20].

The idea of using an EW to provide both attractive
and repulsive forces is due to Ovchinnikov et al. [13], who
proposed the use of two colors (i.e. red and blue detun-
ings) and diﬀering evanescent decay lengths to achieve a
trap with the potential minimum a distance ∼ λ from a
prism surface. Until now, this design has been restricted
to planar traps (weak conﬁnement in the other two di-
mensions).

In this paper we discuss a two-color trap based on the
EW ﬁelds above a single-mode, submicron optical ‘chan-
nel’ waveguide. The trap provides tight conﬁnement in
two dimensions and allows free de Broglie wave propaga-
tion in the third, forming an atomic waveguide that could
transport atoms a between λ/4 and λ/2 above the opti-
cal guide surface. Our proposal is to utilize the diﬀering
vertical evanescent decay lengths of the two polarizations
carried in the single-mode optical guide (see Figure 1).
The physical origin of this decay length diﬀerence is the
fact that the TM mode is closer to optical cut-oﬀ than
the TE mode at the same frequency.

Our proposal is reminiscent of some existing resonant
enhancement schemes for EW mirrors (demonstrated
with surface plasmons [14] and dielectric waveguides [15])
with the radical changes of a planar geometry to a linear,
the mechanism for exciting the guide, and the simultane-
ous guiding of a second frequency of opposite detuning.
It also shares the features of two guided colors with an
atom trap proposal using microsphere whispering-gallery
modes [16].

Our design has many desirable experimental features:
1) very little optical power is required to obtain large
trapping intensities since the optical bound mode has
very small cross sectional area (∼ 0.3 µm2), 2) the op-
tical ﬁeld is non-divergent, so can be maintained over
distances orders of magnitude further than diﬀraction-
limited propagation in free space allows, 3) the trapping
potential is well-known, mechanically stable, and insen-
sitive to experimental parameters other than the optical
powers, since it is deﬁned by single-mode intensity dis-
tributions ﬁxed relative to a substrate, 4) fabrication of
arrays of closely spaced atom waveguides is possible [31],
for parallel lithography or measurement, creating “on-
chip” integrated atom-optical elements, 5) the atoms are
exposed providing additional optical and physical access

1

(a feature not shared with hollow-ﬁber designs), and 6)
the velocity of the atoms along the direction of the waveg-
uide could be controlled by standing waves in the light
carried by the optical guide [21].

Compared to a Zeeman-eﬀect magnetic trap for neutral
atoms, far-detuned optical dipole-force traps can have
comparable trapping times, but typically an order of
magnitude less depth and transverse mode spacings than
recent magnetic traps [4–6]. However, in microfabricated
applications the stray magnetic ﬁelds decay as a power
law with distance, whereas evanescent light ﬁelds decay
exponentially (ignoring for now any scattering into free
space caused by optical defects). We believe this could
give guided optical traps a distinct advantage in terms of
achievable density of independent atom-optical elements
on a single substrate.

Also, optical traps have the advantage that there is no
signiﬁcant loss mechanism which can remove atoms from
the trap (assuming the thermal energy is much less than
the trap depth): spontaneous events cause a small heat-
ing rate, and non-adiabatic changes in mF can change the
optical potential but not the fact that the atom remains
trapped. This is to be contrasted with a non-adiabatic
spin-ﬂip event in a magnetic trap, which results in loss of
the atom. This makes optical waveguides particularly at-
tractive for incoherent transport, when the loss of coher-
ence due to the spontaneous events is unimportant. Fi-
nally, optical manipulation has the advantage over mag-
netic manipulation in terms of high possible switching
speeds.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section I we de-
scribe the dipole potential, the exponential approxima-
tion for the EW ﬁelds, and the mechanism for the diﬀer-
ence in decay length. We show how we optimized the op-
tical guide dimensions, in the case of a rectangular guide
on a substrate of unity refractive index (for mF = 0),
and discuss some design objectives and implementation
In Section II we give simulated results for ce-
issues.
sium atoms: trap depth, coherence time, transverse mode
spacing and Q factor, and spontaneous heating rate. We
also show how depth and coherence time are generally
limited by only two parameters (the detuning and the
normalized decay length diﬀerence). We study both the
case of a substrate refractive index of unity, and in Sec-
tion II C the more realistic index of 1.32. We describe
the numerical electromagnetic ﬁnite element technique
in Section III, including the accuracy achieved. Section
IV is an investigation of two potential causes of loss or
decoherence of atoms, namely interactions with the di-
electric surface and bending of the waveguide. Finally
in Section V we conclude and give some future prospects
for this proposal.

I. TRAP CONCEPT

A. Theory of the light potential

An atom in a near-resonant light ﬁeld of frequency ω
experiences both a conservative force (due to stimulated
photon exchange) and a dissipative force (due to spon-
taneous photon emission) [17,18]. The conservative force
is the gradient of a spatially-dependent potential Udip(r)
which can be viewed as the time-averaged induced dipole
interaction energy (proportional to the real part of the
classical polarizability) in the electric ﬁeld, or equally
well as the ‘light shift’ (that is, energy level shift due to
the ac Stark eﬀect) of the atomic ground state [7,2].

We assume that we apply a monochromatic light ﬁeld
of detuning ∆ ≡ ω − ω0 to an alkali atom (with the
n s → n p transition resonant at ω0), in the far-detuned
regime (∆ greater than the excited state hyperﬁne split-
ting, but much less than ω0) and the low saturation
regime (Ωrabi ≪ ∆, where the Rabi ﬂopping rate Ωrabi is
deﬁned [8] by ¯hΩrabi ≡ µE0, the dipole matrix element
multiplied by the electric ﬁeld amplitude). The dipole
potential has both a scalar and a magnetic part:

Udip(r) = βs

s(r) + µBohr gnuc(L, S, J, i, F )mF |H(r)| ,

¯hΓ
8

Γ
∆

(1.1)

where Γ is the spontaneous decay rate, s(r) is the
spatially-dependent saturation parameter, and the po-
tential is taken to be much less than the ground state
hyperﬁne splitting. Only the magnetic part is aﬀected
by mF , which is deﬁned as the projection of the total
angular momentum F on the direction of the local eﬀec-
tive magnetic ﬁeld H(r). The constant gnuc is the nuclear
Land´e g-factor appropriate for the F of the ground state.
The scalar potential is identical to the case of a two-level
atom, apart from the strength factor βs which is 1
3 for
detuning from the D1 line, 2

3 for the D2 [2].

It is important to be precise with the deﬁnition of the

saturation parameter. We write

s(r) ≡

0 (r)

E2
E2

0,sat

,

(1.2)

where E2
0,sat ≡ 2Isat/ǫ0c (in the MKSA system) is the
squared electric ﬁeld amplitude in a plane wave of in-
tensity Isat [8]. This avoids the ambiguities present with
the usual deﬁnition s(r) ≡ I(r)/Isat in the case of a gen-
eral monochromatic light ﬁeld (composed of an arbitrary
coherent sum of travelling and evanescent waves), and
emphasizes that it is the local electric ﬁeld alone that
causes the dipole potential.

The eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld has a strength and direc-
tion given by the circularly polarized component of the
electric ﬁeld [2], which can be written thus:

µBohrH(r) = βm

where the strength factor βm is − 2
3 for D2,
and we take the physical electric ﬁeld (with amplitude
E0(r) ≡ |E0(r)|) to be the real part of a complex ﬁeld
E(r, t) ≡ E0(r) exp(−iωt). The reason for the ‘dummy’
constant µBohr is aesthetic, so that (1.1) can be expressed
in a standard magnetic form. Note that for nonzero mF
the magnetic and scalar contributions to the potential
are of similar order, if the ﬁelds have signiﬁcant circular
polarization (this will be true for our trapping ﬁelds, for
the reason that the optical guide is close to cut-oﬀ).

The fact that Udip(r) has its sign controlled by the sign
of the detuning allows both attractive (red-detuned) and
repulsive (blue-detuned) potentials to be created. The
potential scales as I/∆ but the spontaneous emission rate
scales as I/∆2; from this follows the well-known result
that, if coherence time is an important factor, it is best
to be far oﬀ-resonance and use high intensities in order
to achieve the desired trap depth [2,7].

For simplicity, in this paper we will restrict our further
analysis and simulations to mF = 0, although our initial
calculations suggest that the eﬀect of the magnetic part
of our potential when trapping in other mF states will
not pose major problems (assuming the spin axis adia-
batically follows the H(r) ﬁeld direction), and can even
be used to our advantage by increasing the depth and the
transverse oscillation frequency ωx in the case mF > 0
[36]. Also we will only consider trapping using a detun-
ing from the D2 line much smaller than the ﬁne splitting,
so that we can neglect the eﬀect of the D1 line.

If we now have two light ﬁelds of diﬀering frequency,
the atomic potentials add [17,13], as long as we as-
sume that the timescale of atomic motion is much slower
than the beating period (that is, the inverse of the fre-
quency diﬀerence).
In our case, atomic motion occurs
at ∼ 105 Hz and our light ﬁeld frequency diﬀerence is
∼ 1015 Hz, so this assumption is valid. Choosing equal
but opposite detunings ±∆ about the D2 line, the trap-
ping potential for mF = 0 is

Udip(r) =

[sblue(r) − sred(r)] ,

(1.4)

written in terms of the saturation parameters for the two
colors. The spontaneous scattering rate [7] is a factor
∆/Γ smaller than Udip(r)/¯h (in fact this relation applies
for any mF state), but it depends on the sum of the
saturation parameters rather than the diﬀerence.
It is
also spatially dependent, and has the form

Γscatt(r) =

[sblue(r) + sred(r)] .

FIG. 1. (a) Shows trap geometry, dielectric guide dimen-
sions, incoming laser polarizations, and the cartesian axes; (b)
shows the trapping potential above the dielectric along a ver-
tical slice at x = 0. The component due to red-detuned light
(absolute value shown as dotted line) subtracts from that of
blue-detuned light (dashed line) to give the total dipole po-
tential Udip (thin solid line). This is modiﬁed by the Casimir
surface interaction (Section IV A), giving the ﬁnal potential
(thick line). Here the trap depth of 150 µK and coherence time
of 12 ms is generated in our design by 2 mW total guided laser
power detuned by ±15 nm from the cesium D2 line.

B. Design of the light ﬁelds

Our basic task is to create intense evanescent light
ﬁelds with a potential minimum suﬃciently far from a di-
electric surface to make the surface interaction potential
and heating mechanisms negligible (discussed in Section
IV A). The main diﬃculty arises because the evanescent
ﬁelds have a typical exponential decay length ∼ λ/2π, so
if we are to have a trap of useful depth, we are restricted
to keep it within roughly λ of the surface (less than a
micron).

A potential minimum in one dimension can be obtained
using a blue (repulsive) light ﬁeld of higher intensity at
the dielectric surface than the red (attractive) light ﬁeld,
and ensuring the decay lengths obey Lred > Lblue, giving
a potential of the form

Udip(y) = Abluee−y/Lblue − Arede−y/Lred .

(1.6)

This gives a repulsive force at short range, which be-
comes attractive at long range (see Figure 1b), and is

3

the scheme for the planar trap of Ovchinnikov et al.
[13]. A large amount of insight into our proposed trap
can be gleaned from this simple one-dimensional model
(which we call the exponential approximation), because
the squared electric ﬁelds above the guide will turn out to
approximate exponential forms in the vertical direction
quite closely.

If we deﬁne a normalized decay length diﬀerence αL ≡
(Lred − Lblue)/Lblue, then we can give two reasons why
increasing αL is a vital design objective. Firstly, it is
easy to show that for small αL the deepest available trap
depth (found by optimizing the ratio of surface intensi-
ties Ared/Ablue) scales as αL. Secondly, a larger αL is
beneﬁcial for trap coherence, (giving a smaller sponta-
neous decay rate at a given trap depth and detuning),
because the sum of the intensities can be kept lower (see
equation (1.5)) for a given intensity diﬀerence (equation
(1.4)). We will quantify this latter connection in Section
II A.

Our two key diﬀerences from the proposal of Ovchin-
nikov et al. are as follows. Firstly, we create a non-zero
αL by using two orthogonally-polarized bound modes of
a dielectric slab guide, which have diﬀerent evanescent
decay lengths at the same frequency [26]. This contrasts
with Ovchinnikov et al. who suggest varying the decay
lengths by varying the reﬂection angles from the inside
surface of a glass prism. Secondly, horizontal conﬁne-
ment is achieved by limiting the width of the slab guide
to approximately λ (forming what is called a channel
guide [27]), which automatically creates a maximum in
each light intensity ﬁeld in the horizontal direction. This
results in a tight horizontal conﬁnement in the atomic
potential, of similar size to the vertical conﬁnement, and
is something very hard to achieve in a prism geometry.

A schematic of our design is shown in Figure 1a. The
optical guide height H and width W are kept small
enough to guarantee that there are exactly two bound
modes, diﬀering in polarization but not in nodal struc-
ture (in optical terminology this is called single-mode):
Ex
11 has an electric ﬁeld predominantly in the x direction
[25], and is to be excited by blue-detuned laser light, and
Ey
11 has electric ﬁeld predominantly in the y direction
and is to be excited by red-detuned laser light. We can
see why their vertical decay lengths diﬀer by consider-
ing the case of the slab (i.e. taking the width W → ∞),
where these modes are simply the slab TE and TM modes
respectively. For both these slab modes the purely trans-
verse ﬁeld obeys the diﬀerential equation

∂2φ
∂y2 = k2

0 [(n(i)

eﬀ )2 − n(y)2] φ ,

(1.7)

eﬀ ≡ k(i)

where φ = Ex (Hx) for the TE (TM) mode, the eigen-
value n(i)
z /k0 is the eﬀective refractive index for the
ith mode (kz being the wavenumber in the propagation
direction and k0 the free space wavenumber), and n(y)
is the spatially-dependent refractive index [27]. (This is
equivalent to a one-dimensional quantum problem in the

direction normal to the slab, in a potential −k2
0n(y)2 with
¯h2/2m = 1). However the boundary conditions on the
slab surfaces diﬀer for the two mode types: φ is always
continuous, but ∂φ/∂y is continuous for TE as opposed
to n−2∂φ/∂y continuous for TM. This asymmetry exists
because the permittivity ǫ = n2 varies in space but the
permeability µ is assumed to be constant. This disconti-
nuity in the gradient for the TM mode forces it to have
a lower neﬀ than that of the TE mode, which means it
is less tightly bound so has a longer evanescent decay
length. This eﬀect becomes more pronounced as the slab
index increases or as optical cut-oﬀ is approached (which
happens when neﬀ decreases until it reaches ns and the
mode becomes unbound). This tendency is preserved
even as the width is decreased to only a few times the
height, as in our scheme.

21 and Ey

No analytic solution exists for the general rectangular
guide, so we used the ﬁnite element method discussed in
Section III to solve for the bound mode neﬀ values and
ﬁelds as a function of guide dimensions. Figure 2 shows
the resulting ‘cut-oﬀ curves’, that is, contours of constant
neﬀ in the parameter space (W, H). In this example we
chose a guide index ng = 1.56 (typical for a polymer
dielectric) and, as a preliminary case, a substrate index

11 and Ex

The single-mode region, in which we wish to remain,
is bounded below by the Ey
11 and Ex
11 curves and above
by the Ey
21 curve. Note that, as in any dielectric guiding
structure uniform in the z axis, the lowest two modes
(Ey
11 in our case) never truly reach cut-oﬀ,
rather, they approach it exponentially as the guide cross-
section is shrunk to zero. For this reason, we chose
the practical deﬁnition of cut-oﬀ for these modes to be
neﬀ = 1.05, which corresponds to only about 20% of the
power being carried inside the guide. In contrast, higher
modes do have true cut-oﬀs [28,27] (this distinction is il-
lustrated by the dispersion curves of Figure 4), and for

red and blue guided laser powers which gave the deep-
est trap, subject to the constraint of ﬁxed total power
(keeping the detuning constant [29]). We also imposed
the restriction that the zero of trapping potential come
no closer than 100 nm along the vertical line x = 0, which
kept the trap minimum a reasonable distance from the
surface (see Section IV A). Performing this optimization
over a region of the parameter space covering the single-
mode region gave a contour plot of maximum achievable
depth for a given total power, shown within the rectangle
overlayed on Figure 2. This depth increases from negli-
gible values in the top left to the largest depths in the
lower right, indicating that choosing W and H to be in
this latter corner of the single-mode region is best for
depth. The depth shows very little variation with W in
this corner, rather it is clear that varying H to stay within
our deﬁnition of the single-mode region has become the
limiting factor on achievable depth. We indicate a prac-
tical choice of W = 0.97 λ and H = 0.25 λ as a small
marker on Figure 2. Example trapping potentials shapes
possible with these parameters are shown in Figure 3; we
discuss their properties in Section II.

C. Discussion of optical cut-oﬀ and substrate choice

We have shown in Figure 2 that parameters optimized
for trap depth are near optical cut-oﬀ. It is worth gather-
ing together the physical reasons for this. Firstly, on gen-
eral geometric grounds, the typical available intensities in
a guide scale inversely with the eﬀective cross-sectional
area of the bound mode, which, far from cut-oﬀ (that
is, when ng − neﬀ ≪ ng − ns) follows very closely the
cross-sectional area of the guide. This makes it favorable
to shrink guiding structures to areas less than a square
wavelength, where they generally become single-mode.
Secondly, once we’re in the single-mode regime, as we
approach cut-oﬀ the mode power is carried increasingly
outside the guide, increasing the ratio of surface intensity
to guide center intensity. Thirdly, the evanescent decay

p

length in the vacuum is longer as we approach cut-oﬀ (re-
call that in the case of the slab, this is exactly expressed
by L−1 = 2k0
n2
eﬀ − 1 [27], where the factor of 2 arises
because we are considering intensity decay length rather
than amplitude). In the special case of ns = 1, the decay
length diverges to inﬁnity as we approach cut-oﬀ. Finally,
the ratio αL becomes larger as we approach cut-oﬀ, with
corresponding beneﬁcial eﬀects on depth and coherence
(due to increasing the ‘goodness factor’ we will introduce
in Section II A).

Unfortunately, these purely theoretical reasons for ap-
proaching cut-oﬀ are in opposition to more practical ones.
The closer to cut-oﬀ a guide is, the more sensitive it is
to manufacturing variations in cross-section: in our case
this will be predominantly a sensitivity to H. The re-
sult is that small variations in H cause large variations
in mode size, or, at worst, complete cut-oﬀ. If the mode
size change is rapid (nonadiabatic) along the z axis, (for
instance if this change is due to surface roughness or re-
fractive index inhomogeneities) the resulting mismatches
will be a source of scattering of the guided power. Any
scattering back down the guide will set up periodic mod-
ulations of the light ﬁeld over long distances. (One way
to defeat the coherent addition of these modulations is
to use very broad line-width light sources). The conse-
quence for the atoms would be a z-dependent trap depth
and shape, and this could lead to partial reﬂection or even
localization of the matter waves. In general we expect
scattering to limit how close to cut-oﬀ we can reliably
operate.

With regard to the substrate, further practical issues
arise.
In the above cut-oﬀ calculation we chose the
simplest case of ns = 1, corresponding to a guide sur-
rounded by vacuum. A real substrate with ns > 1 has
the unfortunate eﬀect of limiting the propagation con-
stant kz of strictly bound modes to be larger than the
freely propagating wavevector in the substrate; in other
words, neﬀ > ns must hold or the light ﬁeld will rapidly
tunnel into the ‘attractive potential’ of the substrate.
This in turn limits the decay lengths and αL that can
be achieved. The trap properties quoted in the abstract
and in Sections II A and II B paper rely on very low neﬀ
values (1.07 for the Ey
11) for the rea-
son that a low neﬀ is the only way to create long evanes-
cent decay lengths in the vacuum. (This is equivalent to
Ovchinnikov et al. choosing reﬂection angles very close
to critical [13].) However, in Section II C we present pre-
liminary results for a substrate of sodium ﬂuoride (the
lowest-index common optical mineral, at n = 1.32), and
do not believe the substrate alters the basic feasibility of
our waveguide.

11 mode, 1.18 for Ex

For completeness, here we list some other possible ap-
proaches to the substrate issue. 1) Use an aerogel sub-
strate, which can have exceptionally low refractive indices
and low loss (ﬁlms of several µm thickness with indices
of about 1.1 can be produced [32]). 2) Use a dielectric
multilayer substrate with an eﬀective index of unity or
less (very low loss multilayer mirrors [30] with eﬀective

5

indices less than unity can be created). 3) Investigate
if there exist guide shapes which have suﬃciently small
tunnelling rate into a conventional substrate that the fact
that the modes are not strictly bound becomes irrele-
vant (for instance, a wedge shape with the smallest face
in contact with the substrate). 4) Unsupported guiding
structures could be produced over short distances [31].
Finally, it is important to note that the idea of replacing
the substrate by a metallic reﬂective layer is not practical
because they are too lossy.

Ultimately, the best values of W and H, the best guide
cross-sectional shape, and the substrate choice will de-
pend on many of the above factors and is an area for
further research.

FIG. 3. Trapping potential shapes in the xy plane, with
guide dimensions of 0.83 µm by 0.21 µm and an index of 1.56.
In each case the maximum depth is 100 µK and the coherence
time of atoms in the ground state is 19 ms, achieved with
detuning ±15 nm from the cesium D2 line. The outer con-
tour shows a depth of 3 µK, the cesium MOT temperature.
Subsequent contours are spaced by 6 µK. The plots illustrate
the range of trapping distances acheivable: the upper trap
(p = 0.4, using a total guided power of 1 mW) has a mini-
mum 0.24 µm from the surface; the lower trap (p = 0.2, total
guided power of 7.5 mW) has a minimum 0.44 µm from the
surface.

II. TRAP PROPERTIES

In the bulk of this Section we will examine the atomic
waveguide properties for light nearly resonant with the
D2 line of cesium, using an optical guide of index 1.56
of the dimensions W = 0.97 λ and H = 0.25 λ from Sec-
tion I B, and a substrate of unity index. The saturation
intensity for cesium is 11.2 W/m2 [7], and its resonant
wavelength of 852 nm requires that the physical guide
size is 0.83 µm by 0.21 µm. (At the end of the Section
we present preliminary calculations for a ns = 1.32 sub-
strate and a diﬀerent guide, and discuss how the atom
waveguide properties are changed).

Given the guide, we are free to choose three experi-
mental parameters, namely the optical powers carried in
the two modes, and the detuning ∆ (assumed to be sym-
metric, that is, to be of equal magnitude for red and blue
beams, because little advantage can be gained with an
unsymmetric detuning). The ﬁrst two of these can use-
fully be reexpressed as total power Ptot ≡ Pred + Pblue,
and the power ratio p ≡ Pred/Pblue. The trap shape
will be aﬀected by p alone: we show the trapping poten-
tial shapes achievable at the two practical extremes of
p = 0.4 and p = 0.2 in Figure 3, where we have chosen
Ptot and ∆ to give identical trap depths and coherence
times. Smaller p values cause the trap minimum to move
further from the surface (a distinct advantage), to be
less “bean” shaped (i.e. to have smaller cubic deviations
from a 2D harmonic oscillator), and to cause a slight in-
crease in collection area. It is possible to achieve a trap
minimum as distant as y0 = 0.52 λ from the surface when
p = 0.2. The only disadvantage to implementing these
smaller p values is that a higher Ptot is required to achieve
the same trap depth and coherence time (for instance a
factor of 7.5 increase is required as we take p from 0.4 to
0.2). This can be quantiﬁed within the exponential ap-
proximation, and it can be found that the total power re-
quired to maintain a given depth and coherence time with
a ﬁxed trap geometry scales as Ptot ∼ (1 + p)/p1+1/αL .
If we were purely interested in maximizing trap depth
at a given Ptot and detuning, it would be best to make
p as large as possible, however if we take p much larger
than 0.4 the trap is brought so close that the corners of
the “bean” shape touch the dielectric surface (see Figure
3, upper plot) and we will lose eﬀective collection area
due to sticking of atoms onto this surface.

A. Depth, coherence time, and Q factor

We may ask what trade-oﬀs are necessary between trap
depth and coherence time. It turns out that, within the
exponential approximation (1.6), this is elegantly quan-
tifyable. We can deﬁne a ‘goodness factor’

G ≡

sblue(r0) − sred(r0)
sblue(r0) + sred(r0)

=

Γ
¯h|∆|

Umaxτcoh,

where the trap minimum position r0 is at (x = 0, y = y0),
and the second equality is veriﬁed by substitution of (1.4)
and (1.5), and deﬁning Umax ≡ |Udip(r0)| and τcoh ≡
scatt(r0). We use this latter deﬁnition because we are
Γ−1
interested in the coherence time of atoms spending time
close to the trap minimum (which will certainly be true
for the transverse ground state.) Using (1.6) to solve for
y0 and evaluate the ‘goodness factor’, it turns out that
the factor is independent of either laser power (i.e. of
either Ared or Ablue), giving

G =

Lred − Lblue
Lred + Lblue

=

αL
2 + αL

.

Combining (2.1) and (2.2) gives

Umaxτcoh =

αL
2 + αL

(2.3)

ﬁxing the product of achievable depth and coherence time
as a constant multiple of the detuning. This is a remark-
able result since it shows that increasing αL is really the
only objective in the ﬁeld design of two-color EW traps.
We can write this in units more convenient for cesium
trap design, thus,

where the value αL = 0.47 ± 0.02 (taken from best-ﬁt
exponentials to the numerically-found squared electric
ﬁelds for the guide dimensions of Section I B with ns = 1)
has been substituted to give the the ﬁnal form. This de-
sign expression does not give the Ptot required to reach
a desired balance between Umax and τcoh, however, the
total laser power is usually in the mW range, several
orders of magnitude less than in most free-space trap de-
signs. For instance, with Ptot = 20 mW, p = 0.4 and
∆ = ±15 nm we could generate a trap of 2 mK depth
with the relatively short coherence time of 0.9 ms. The
transverse oscillation frequencies in this trap would be
ωx/2π = 116 kHz and ωy/2π = 490 kHz (the ﬁeld shapes
ﬁx this ratio at about 1:4), giving an atomic mode spacing
due to the x motion of 5.6 µK, roughly twice the cesium
MOT temperature, and a characteristic ground-state size
of 26 nm by 12 nm.

For coherent guiding, we can deﬁne a more physically
meaningful ﬁgure of merit, Q ≡ ω⊥τcoh, which tells us
the typical number of coherent transverse oscillations we
can expect multiplied by 2π (i.e.
it is the Q-factor of
the transverse oscillations). We should choose ω⊥ = ωx
since this is the smaller of the transverse frequencies in
our case. For Q ≫ 1 the transverse atomic modes will
be well resolved, and our guide can be a useful interfer-
ometric device. Using (2.3), in conjunction with the fact
that when the trapping potential shape is ﬁxed then ωx
is proportional to the square root of the depth, tells us

that for a given trap and detuning, Q ∝ 1/ωx. For a
higher Q we should choose smaller transverse oscillation
frequencies, that is, shallower traps. For example, the
2 mK trap discussed above has Q ≈ 650, but if we re-
duce it to a 20 µK trap of the same ∆ (by changing p or
the laser powers), the Q is 10 times larger. Increasing ∆
would allow even higher Q to be realized.

The dependence on detuning in (2.4) is another way
of expressing the advantages already known about using
far oﬀ-resonant beams [7,2]. In this paper, we have some-
what arbitrarily limited our detuning to 15 nm, because it
is much less than the 43 nm ﬁne splitting of cesium, since
it is in this regime that the calculations were performed.
This limits the depths, coherence times and Q factors
quoted here. We expect many new EW atom waveguide
designs will rely on much larger detunings, probably sig-
niﬁcant fractions of λ (requiring separate handling of the
two colors for the bound mode calculations), especially
for coherent applications.

B. Other properties

We estimate the collection area of the trap as the cross-
sectional region within which the potential is deeper than
the typical cesium MOT energy kBTMOT. For our exam-
ple 100 µK traps of Figure 3 this area is about 1 µm2.
However, it is not possible to do much better than this
if one tries to increase the area by
with our design:
increasing the overall trap depth, the kBTMOT contour
touches the substrate, indicating that atoms at this en-
ergy can reach the substrate surface, where they will
stick, limiting the eﬀective collection area.

To investigate the lifetime of atoms transported in-
coherently (the multi-mode regime), we can calculate
the heating rate along similar lines as Grimm and Wei-
dem¨uller [2]. We start with their equation (23) which
gives the rate of change of the average of the total en-
ergy of atomic motion E = Ekin + Epot as

˙E = kBTR Γscatt ,

(2.5)

TR being the recoil temperature, and use the assumption
that in an equilibrated 3D trap Ekin = 3
2 kBT . Since there
is harmonic motion in two directions but free motion in
the third, the virial theorem gives us Epot = 2
3 Ekin. Com-
bining this with Γscatt = UmaxΓ/G¯h∆ from (2.1) gives
the heating rate

˙T =

5G

Γ

,

(2.6)

which is of the order of one recoil temperature per coher-
ence time. For our 100 µK depth trap at ∆ = 15 nm the
rate is 4.4 µK s−1, implying that storage and transport
for many seconds is possible. For simplicity, we have ig-
nored the fact that there may be distinct longitudinal and
transverse temperatures which do not equilibrate over the
trapping timescales.

C. Eﬀect of a realistic substrate

In this section we present calculations, performed using
the method of Section III, for a practical substrate choice
of sodium ﬂuoride (the lowest refractive index common
mineral, with ns = 1.32 at a wavelength of 852 nm), and
investigate how this changes the atom waveguide prop-
erties from those presented above. We increased ng to
1.7 (dense ﬂint glass, e.g. BaSF type) in order to provide
suﬃcient index diﬀerence from the substrate.

Fixing the width at W = 1.00 λ, we found that a height
H = 0.34 λ gave the largest αL of 0.20±0.01, and allowed
both modes to be suﬃciently far from cut-oﬀ (greater
than half the power being carried inside the guide for
both modes). The result is a goodness factor G which
is approximately half that of the ns = 1 case, with a
corresponding halving of the achievable product of depth
and coherence time according to (2.4), and doubling of
the heating rate at a given Umax and ∆ according to
(2.6). The shorter decay lengths of 56 nm and 68 nm
(compared to 93 nm and 137 nm for ns = 1) cause the
typical trapping distance y0 to be reduced by a factor of
roughly 1.8.

We found that in order to reproduce the depth of
100 µK and y0 = 0.24 µm of the upper trap of Figure
3 (with ∆ unchanged) we needed Ptot = 22 mW, giving
τcoh = 9 ms. The large power increase over the 1 ˙mW
required for ns = 1 is explained by the fact that this
y0 is now towards the upper limit practically achievable
rather than the lower.
(If y0 is instead scaled in pro-
portion to the new decay lengths, the required increase
in Ptot is only a factor 1.7).
In this example, we ﬁnd
the transverse oscillation frequencies have increased to
ωx/2π = 81 kHz and ωy/2π = 202 kHz, compared to the
original ωx/2π = 26 kHz and ωy/2π = 109 kHz. The in-
crease in ωy is explained entirely by the shorter decay
lengths, and the increase in ωx (by a factor of over 3) is
attributed to tighter optical mode shapes. It is clear that
this latter eﬀect outweighs the decrease in τcoh, implying
that the inclusion of the substrate has actually increased
Q by 50%.

In summary, the eﬀects of including a realistic sub-
strate limit the maximum trapping distance y0 that can
be achieved (because of the reduction in decay lengths),
lower the goodness factor, increase the heating rate and
the required optical power, but also increase the oscilla-
tion frequencies. For our substrate choice, each of these
changes was approximately a factor of 2, and we believe
that they do not alter the basic practicality of imple-
menting our proposed waveguide.

the case of a free-standing dielectric cylinder of ng = 1.56. We
used discretization and box-size identical to the rectangular
guide case, and observe typical errors of ±0.5% in propagation
constant for the ﬁrst two modes. The mode naming conven-
tion and analytic calculation follow Snitzer [28]; an asterisk
indicates a doubly-degenerate mode.

III. NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE LIGHT
FIELDS

The detailed electric ﬁeld distribution is very impor-
tant in calculating the trapping potential above the
waveguide. An approximation to the form of the ﬁelds in
the y direction is given by the analytically-known solu-
tion for the slab waveguide, but to get more accuracy and
knowledge of the full potential shape in the x-y plane, we
used a full-vector ﬁnite element calculation.

The technique represents the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds as simple piecewise functions over many “elements”
(regions) subdividing a slice through the guide and sur-
rounding media in the xy plane, therefore by a ﬁnite num-
ber of degrees of freedom. Each element has a dielectric
constant associated with it, allowing arbitrary stepwise
refractive index distributions in the xy plane to be mod-
elled. Maxwell’s equations for propagating solutions of
the form exp(ikzz − iωt) are reduced to a generalized
sparse eigenvalue equation with k2
z as the eigenvalue and
the bound mode ﬁeld distributions as the eigenvectors
[35]. Speciﬁcally, we used the technique of Fernandez
and Lu [33], with Hx and Hy as the ﬁeld degrees of free-
dom, for simplicity using ﬁrst-order (bilinear) functions
to represent these ﬁelds over a non-uniform but separable
rectangular grid of elements. This required a generaliza-
tion of the Fernandez and Lu implementation, and care-
ful consideration of their line-integral terms (which are
non-standard for a ﬁnite element formulation) [36]. Of
the many available ﬁnite element approaches to dielectric
waveguide mode solving, this frequency-domain method
was chosen for its absence of ‘spurious modes’, its ability
to handle index step discontinuities, its small number of

8

required degrees of freedom and its matrix sparsity [34].
Rather than emulating a radiative boundary condition
(a notoriously hard task usually requiring an iterative
procedure due to the kz dependence), we enclosed the
problem in a large, perfectly-conducting box of suﬃcient
size that the bound mode evanescent ﬁelds were negli-
gible on its walls, making the nature of the boundary
condition irrelevant. However, the average level spac-
ing of the unbound modes (the ‘continuum’) decreases
with increasing box size, and especially near cut-oﬀ this
increases the number of iterations required to solve the
eigenvalue problem to a given accuracy (we used the well-
known ARPACK solver to ﬁnd the 11 lowest eigenmodes
of the sparse matrix). We found that a box size of 6λ
to 7λ gave the best compromise between accuracy and
speed. Our non-uniform elements allowed us to have a
high element density across the waveguide and in the
trapping region, but a low density over the much larger
box area, keeping the total number of degrees of freedom
manageable.

The fractional error ǫ in the propagation constant kz
was less than 1%, and the accuracy of the electric ﬁeld
strengths in the trapping region ≈ 3%, when we used
N ∼ 2000 elements. This was suﬃciently accurate for the
present work. Finding the bound modes of each waveg-
uide parameter choice typically took between 3 and 20
minutes of computing time on a Silicon Graphics R8000
processor, depending on how close to cut-oﬀ the guide
was. We tested the accuracy of the method by solving
a cylindrical guide in an identical fashion with the same
N and a very similar non-uniform grid, for which there
are known ﬁeld solutions [28]. Figure 4 shows the prop-
agation constant agrees with the analytics to within 1%,
even close to cut-oﬀ. The convergence with N was mea-
sured for the rectangular guide case, and found to be
ǫ ∼ N −γ with 0.55 < γ < 0.7. This is less than optimal
for ﬁrst-order elements (which have a maximum possi-
ble convergence of γ = 1), and is believed to be due to
an inability of the bilinear functions to represent physi-
cal in-plane E and H components at dielectric steps, or
the weak ﬁeld singularities which can physically occur at
any exterior dielectric sharp edges (regardless of whether
acute or obtuse) [36].

Future improvements to the method, which would in-
crease the accuracy or the convergence rate γ, include: 1)
using higher order elements (if done carefully, this could
correctly represent physical E and H components at di-
electric steps), and explicit modelling of the ﬁeld singu-
larities at guide corners using specialized elements.

IV. FURTHER DECOHERENCE AND LOSS
MECHANISMS

A. Eﬀects of surface interactions

The EW trap has the beneﬁt of creating high ﬁeld
gradients near a surface, but along with this comes the
disadvantage that interactions with that surface that can
alter the trap potential and even cause heating and loss
of trapped atoms.

An atom’s change in potential near a surface is known
as the van der Waals interaction (l ≪ λ) or the Casimir
interaction (l ≫ λ), depending on the distance l from
the surface compared to λ, the dominant wavelength re-
sponsible for the polarizability of the atom (in our case
of Cs this is the D line resonance, the same as our trap-
ping resonance). There is a smooth cross-over from van
der Waals (U ∼ l−3, which can be viewed as the atom’s
electrostatic interaction with the image of its own ﬂuctu-
ating dipole) to Casimir (U ∼ l−4, which can be viewed
as a retarded van der Waals attraction or equally well
as an atomic level shift due to a cavity QED eﬀect) at
In the case of a perfect mirror surface,
l ≈ λ/10 [37].
the full form is known for any l, but for a dielectric sur-
face, the expression becomes much more complicated to
evaluate [38].

Since our trapping distances are larger than this cross-
over point, we will use the Casimir form, which is correct
for asymptotically large l, and is always an overestimate
of the true potential [37]. The dependence of the coeﬃ-
cient with dielectric constant is complicated [39,41], but
we will use the simpler approximate form given by Spruch
and Tikochinsky [38], to give

UCas(l) = −

8π

¯hc α(0)
4πǫ0 l4

ǫ − 1
ǫ + (30/23)ǫ1/2 + 7/23

(4.1)

(in the MKSA system). This approximate form is known
to be within 6% of the exact expression for any dielectric
constant ǫ [41]. Substituting the recently calculated [40]
static polarizability of cesium, α(0) = 399.9 a.u., gives
a Casimir interaction coeﬃcient of 4.9 nK µm4 for ng =
1.56.

Figure 1b shows the eﬀect of this potential on a typ-
ical trap of depth 150 µK and distance y0 = 270 nm. It
is clear that the change is negligible further than 100 nm
from the surface, and a WKB tunneling calculation along
this straight-line path (at x = 0) shows that even if all
atoms that reach the surface stick, the loss rate from the
ﬁrst few transverse modes is entirely negligible. How-
ever, care should be taken with the multi-mode regime,
or in the case of high-p traps, since the tunneling via the
corners of the “bean” shape may dominate for p > 0.4
(Figure 3).

The issue of energy transfer to trapped atoms due to
a ﬁnite (and possibly room) temperature nearby surface
is far less well understood, and may be a problem with
many surface-based particle traps, as discussed by Henkel
and Wilkens [42]. However, since we are trapping neutral
particles and the conductivity of our surface is low, we

9

expect a decoherence rate negligible compared to that al-
ready present from spontaneous absorption and emission
cycles.

B. Bending the waveguide

It would be very useful to be able to carry atom beams
along curved paths, by bending our atom waveguide in
the plane of the substrate, without signiﬁcant atom loss.
Here we brieﬂy estimate three limitations on the waveg-
uide minimum bending radius (in decreasing order of le-
niency): 1) the limit imposed by optical radiation leak-
age, 2) the limit needed for incoherent atom transport,
and 3) the limit needed for coherent atom transport in
the transverse groundstate. This will give us an idea of
the practicality of curved atomic guides.

Firstly, whenever a dielectric optical guide has curva-
ture, there is a loss rate (exponentially small in the cur-
vature radius R), which can be viewed as tunneling out
of the guide’s ‘potential well’ induced by the addition of
an eﬀective centrifugal potential. In the limit R ≫ W ,
the eﬀective potential is linear with x (the radial coordi-
nate), and the fractional loss per radian of curvature can
be estimated [43], for instance using the one-dimensional
WKB formula, to be

α = C

exp

−

R

x (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

(4.2)

where Lx is the evanescent decay length in the radial
direction, and C is a constant of order unity. There-
fore for negligible light loss at a π/2 bend we need
R > 60π2L3
x/λ2, typically a couple of tens of microns.
This is so small chieﬂy because we are using an optical
guide with a large refractive index step [27].

Secondly, we consider atom loss from an incoherent
beam with a transverse temperature kBT⊥ (assumed
small compared to the trap depth magnitude Umax), and
a longitudinal kinetic energy Ek. We call the approxi-
mate spatial extent of the trap potential in the x direction
2ξ, and restrict ourselves to one-dimensional classical mo-
tion in this direction. When in a region of radius of curva-
ture R ≫ ξ, an eﬀective centrifugal term adds to the trap-
ping potential giving U (x) = Udip(x) − 2Ek(x/R). This
causes the atoms to ‘slosh’ towards positive x, only ever
returning if there exists a point where U (x) > −Umax
for x > 0. We can estimate that this will happen
if Umax > 2Ek(ξ/R), giving our lower limit on R as
2ξEk/Umax. In our design ξ ≈ 0.5 µm, so if we choose
R = 1 mm we can expect loss-free transport of a beam
at a longitudinal kinetic energy up to 103 times the trap
depth.

Thirdly, to model coherent matter-wave propagation
along a curved guide, we consider the amplitude for re-
maining in the transverse ground-state, having passed
into a curved section and back into a straight section. If
again we assume one-dimensional x motion, and assume

2 M ω2

a harmonic potential U (x) = 1
x(x − x0)2 around the
trap minimum, then the eﬀect of curvature is to shift the
minimum position from x0 = 0 to x0 = 2Ek/M ω2
xR. If
this shift is much less than the characteristic ground-state
size (¯h/M ωx)1/2 then the projection at each transition
will be high, resulting in high ﬂux transmission coeﬃ-
x)1/2 as our condition,
cient. This gives R ≫ 2Ek/(¯hM ω3
which for Ek/kB = 10 mK (that is, vk = 1.1 ms−1) and
ωx/2π = 40 kHz corresponds to R ≫ 0.45 mm. This limit
is very conservative since we have not yet made use of the
adiabatic condition Ω ≪ ωx (where Ω ≡ vk/R is the rate
of change of direction of the guided atom), to design a
waveguide path without discontinuities in the curvature.
In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to
bend atoms both incoherently and coherently through
large angles on a compact substrate structure of a few
millimeters in size.

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented a novel substrate-based neutral
atom waveguide, based on the optical dipole force, which
combines the features of a planar far-detuned two-color
evanescent trap [13] with the ability to conﬁne strongly
along two axes. We utilized the diﬀering vertical de-
cay lengths of the two bound-mode polarizations of a
submicron-sized optical waveguide near cut-oﬀ. We have
shown that only a few milliwatts of guided laser power
can create atomic potential depths ∼ 100 µK with trans-
verse oscillation frequencies ∼ 100 kHz, a coherence time
∼ 10 ms and a trap minimum 200-400 nm above the opti-
cal guide surface, for Cs atoms in the mF = 0 state. Laser
powers greater than ten milliwatts can give a transverse
mode spacing greater than the temperature of a Cs MOT,
opening up the single-mode waveguide regime. The ad-
vantages of guiding optical trapping ﬁelds on a substrate
include mechanical stability and reliability, mass produc-
tion and the potential for transport along complicated
paths.

We have given some design criteria for guided-
lightwave two-color atom waveguides (chieﬂy the max-
imization of the evanescent decay lengths, and of their
normalized diﬀerence αL), and shown that a substrate of
low refractive index can be very beneﬁcial. We modelled
in detail the trapping potentials for a general rectangu-
lar guide of index 1.56 above a unity-index substrate, and
have shown that a realistic substrate choice of index 1.32
poses few problems to the viability of the device. We pre-
dict that the eﬀect of the surface interaction is generally
small, and that coherent guiding is possible around cor-
ners of radii ∼ 1 mm for a longitudinal velocity ∼ 1 ms−1.
We also believe that the magnetic part of the potential
felt by nonzero mF atoms could be used to increase the
depth and oscillation frequencies further.

This preliminary work (speciﬁcally equation (2.3)) in-
dicates that utilizing detunings much larger than the

10

15 nm we limit ouselves to here will be very advantageous
for coherent guiding. We have only scratched the surface
of the design variations possible; for instance, equaliz-
ing the horizontal and vertical oscillation frequencies is
yet to be attempted. The use of two polarizations is our
solution to the problem of maximizing αL when the de-
tuning is very small compared to the wavelength, but we
suspect that there will exist other fruitful schemes where
these are comparable (∆ ∼ ω0, very far-detuning) and
where a large αL is caused simply by the diﬀerent opti-
cal cut-oﬀ conditions at the two wavelengths. We have
reserved investigation of cooling schemes for future work
(although this has already been demonstrated in an EW
mirror [44] and proposed in EW traps [45]). We believe
that the potential shapes capable of being produced by
guided waves on a substrate also include the possibility
of funnel-type loading schemes and coherent atom cou-
plers, allowing for a complete “integrated” atom-optical
experiment on a substrate.

[25] Following the notation of Fernandez & Lu [33] for rectan-
gular guides, mode Ek
nm has n(m) antinodes in the x(y)
direction, and overall polarization axis k = x, y. However
as the symmetry line W = H is approached (see Figure
2), mixing of polarizations occurs for the case n 6= m and
the notation becomes more arbitrary.

[26] Even though the frequencies will actually diﬀer by a cou-
ple of percent because of their detunings, and cause a
diﬀerence in decay lengths of the correct sign, this eﬀect
alone is not large enough to create large αL values. Future
designs with larger detunings, possibly much larger than
the ﬁne splitting, may be able to use this eﬀect alone.

used in this paper the fractional shift is 1.8%.

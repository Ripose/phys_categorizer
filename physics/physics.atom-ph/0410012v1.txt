We consider evaluation of matrix elements with the coupled-cluster method. Such calculations
formally involve inﬁnite number of terms and we devise a method of partial summation (dressing)
of the resulting series. Our formalism is built upon an expansion of the product C †C of cluster
amplitudes C into a sum of n-body insertions. We consider two types of insertions: particle/hole
line insertion and two-particle/two-hole random-phase-approximation-like insertion. We demon-
strate how to “dress” these insertions and formulate iterative equations. We illustrate the dressing
equations in the case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and double excitations. Using
univalent systems as an example, we upgrade coupled-cluster diagrams for matrix elements with
the dressed insertions and highlight a relation to pertinent fourth-order diagrams. We illustrate our
formalism with relativistic calculations of hyperﬁne constant A(6s) and 6s1/2 − 6p1/2 electric-dipole
transition amplitude for Cs atom. Finally, we augment the truncated coupled-cluster calculations
with otherwise omitted fourth-order diagrams. The resulting analysis for Cs is complete through
the fourth-order of many-body perturbation theory and reveals an important role of triple and
disconnected quadruple excitations.

INTRODUCTION

Coupled-cluster (CC) method [1, 2] is a powerful and ubiquitous technique for solving quantum many-body problem.
Let us brieﬂy recapitulate general features of the CC method, so we can motivate our further discussion. At the heart
of the CC method lies the exponential ansatz for the exact many-body wavefunction

|Ψii = exp(Ti)|0ii = (1 + Ti +

reference Slater determinant |0ii. The parametrization (1) is derived from rigorous re-summation of many-body
perturbation theory (MBPT) series. From solving the eigenvalue equation one determines the cluster amplitudes and
the associated energies. While the ansatz (1) contains an inﬁnite number of terms due to expansion of the exponent,
the resulting equations for cluster amplitudes T (k)
contain a ﬁnite number of terms. This simplifying property is
unfortunately lost when the resulting wavefunctions are used in calculations of matrix elements: upon expansion of
exponents the number of terms becomes inﬁnite. Indeed, consider matrix elements of an operator Z, e.g., transition
amplitude between two states

In this paper we address a question of partially summing the terms of the above expansion for matrix elements, so
that the result subsumes an inﬁnite number of terms.

More speciﬁcally we are interested in transitions between states of univalent atoms, such as alkali-metal atoms.
There has been a number of relativistic coupled-cluster calculations for these systems [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular,
calculations [3, 4, 5, 6] ignore the non-linear terms (λ > 1 and µ > 1) in the expansion (3); we will designate this
approximation as linearized coupled-cluster (LCC) method. At the same time, it is well established that for the
univalent atoms an important chain of many-body diagrams for matrix elements comes from so-called random-phase
approximation (RPA). A direct comparison of the RPA series and the truncated LCC expansion in Ref. [10] leads to
a conclusion that a fraction of the RPA chain is missed due to the omitted non-linear terms. One of the methods
to correct for the missing RPA diagrams has been investigated in Ref. [4]. These authors replaced the bare matrix
elements with the dressed matrix elements as prescribed by the RPA method. Such a direct RPA dressing involved
a partial subset of diagrams already included in the CC method, i.e., it leads to a double-counting of diagrams.
To partially rectify this shortcoming, the authors of Ref. [4] have manually removed certain leading-order diagrams,
higher-order terms being doubly counted. Here we present an alternative inﬁnite-summation scheme for RPA chain
that avoids the double counting and thus a manual removal of the “extra” diagrams.

In addition to the RPA-like dressing of the coupled-cluster diagrams for matrix elements, we consider another subset
of diagrams that leads to a dressing of particle and hole lines in the CC diagrams. The leading order corrections due
to the dressing scheme presented here arise in the fourth order of MBPT, and in this paper we present a detailed
comparison with the relevant fourth-order diagrams. Finally, we illustrate our approach with relativistic computation
of hyperﬁne-structure constants and dipole matrix elements for Cs atom.
In addition to dressing corrections we
incorporate certain classes of diagrams from the direct fourth-order MBPT calculation (as in Ref. [10, 11]), so that
the result is complete through the fourth order. To the best of our knowledge, the reported calculations are the ﬁrst
calculations for Cs complete through the fourth order of MBPT.

The paper is organized as follows. First, we present a more extensive discussion of the CC formalism in Section II.
Further we dress particle and hole lines in Section IV, and discuss RPA-like dressing in Section V. The present
paper may be considered as an all-order extension of forth-order calculation [10, 11], and in Section VI we present
an illustrative comparison with the IV-order diagrams. Finally, the designed summation schemes are illustrated
numerically in Section VII and the conclusions are drawn in Section VIII. Unless noted otherwise, atomic units,
~ = |e| = me ≡ 1, are used throughout the paper. We follow the convention of Ref. [12] for drawing Brueckner-
Goldstone diagrams.

II. COUPLED-CLUSTER FORMALISM FOR UNIVALENT SYSTEMS

In this Section we specialize our discussion of the coupled-cluster method to the atomic systems with one valence
electron outside closed shell core. We review various approximations and summarize the CC formalism for calculation
of matrix elements.

We are interested in solving the atomic many-body problem. The total Hamiltonian H is partitioned as

H = H0 + G ,

where H0 is the suitably chosen lowest-order Hamiltonian and the residual interaction G = H − H0 is treated as
a perturbation. For systems with one valence electron outside closed-shell core, a convenient choice for H0 is the
frozen-core (V N −1) Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian [13]. In the following, we explicitly specify the state v of the valence
electron, so that the proper reference eigenstate |0ii of H0 is |0vi = a†
v|0ci, where pseudo-vacuum state |0ci speciﬁes
the occupied core.

For open-shell systems a general CC parametrization reads [12]

where curly brackets denote normal product of operators. For univalent system the above ansatz may be simpliﬁed
to

|Ψii = {exp(Ti)} |Φii ,

|Ψvi = exp (C) Sva†

In these formulae and throughout the paper we employ the following labeling convention:
indexes a, b, c, d denote
single-particle states occupied in the core |0ci and indexes m, n, r, s, t stand for remaining (virtual/excited) orbitals.
In this convention valence states v and w form a subset of the virtual orbitals. Finally, indexes i, j, k, l stand for
any of the above classes of single-electron orbitals. In Eqs. (7,8) the cluster amplitudes ρij stand for single-particle
excitations and ρijkl for two-particle excitations, with an apparent generalization to k-fold excitation amplitudes.

Dictated by the computational complexity, in most applications the cluster operator is truncated at single and
v . A further linearized (LCCSD)

double excitations (CCSD approximation): C ≈ C(1) + C(2) and Sv ≈ 1 + S(1)
approximation consists in neglecting non-linear terms in the expansion of exponent in Eq.(5), i.e.,

v + S(2)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

As discussed in the introduction, the cluster amplitudes can be found from solving a proper analog of the eigen-value
equation. We assume that these equations are solved and in a typical application we are faced with the necessity
of computing matrix elements, Eq. (2), between two many-body wavefunctions |Ψvi and |Ψwi. As demonstrated by
Blundell et al. [3], so-called disconnected diagrams [12] in the numerator and the denominator of Eq. (2) cancel. Their
ﬁnal expression for the exact matrix element reads

Mwv = δwv (Z core)conn +
Z val
wv
v )conn] [1 + (N val
(cid:1)

{[1 + (N val

conn

(cid:0)

w )conn]}1/2 ,

where the matrix element Zwv, Eq.(3), is split into core Z core and valence Z val
wv contributions, the diagrams comprising
Z core being independent of the valence indexes. The valence and core parts of the normalization factor Nv are deﬁned
in a similar fashion. Notice that all the diagrams in Eq. (10) must be rigorously connected as emphasized by subscripts
“conn”. Since the total angular momentum of the closed-shell core is zero, the core contribution Z core vanishes for
non-scalar (and pseudo-scalar) operators and in the following discussion we will mainly focus on Z val
wv .

Blundell et al. [3] have employed the LCCSD parametrization for the wavefunction (9) to derive 21 diagrams for
v . The LCCSD contributions to Z core can be found in Ref. [14]. It is the goal of this
wv and 5 contributions to N val
Z val
paper to go beyond these linearized LCCSD contributions. The LCCSD approximation will provide us with “skeleton”
diagrams that will be “dressed” due to nonlinear CC terms. We display representative LCCSD diagrams in Fig. 1.
In a typical calculation, the dominant correction to the Hartree-Fock (HF) value arise from RPA-type diagram (a)
and Brueckner-orbital (BO) diagrams (c) and (d). (We retain the original enumeration scheme of Ref. [3] for the
diagrams.) Here are the corresponding algebraic expressions for these LCCSD contributions

As prescribed by the Wick theorem [12], this expression may be simpliﬁed by contracting creation and annihilation
operators between various parts of this expression. Very complex structures may arise, so as a preliminary construct,
consider a product C†C. Using the Wick theorem, this product may be expanded into a sum of normal forms

elements, as shown in Section IV.

IV. DRESSING PARTICLE AND HOLE LINES

In this section we focus on one-body term of the product C†C, Eq. (14), and derive all-order insertions for particle

Topologically, the ﬁrst term is an object where a free hole line enters some (possibly very complex) structure from
above and another hole line leaves below. The second term has a similar structure but with particle lines. In Fig. 2,
we draw these object as rectangles with “stumps” indicating where the particle or hole line is to be attached. The
remaining terms in Eq. (14) have both particle and hole lines involved; we will disregard these terms in the following
discussion.

First we prove that given a certain CC diagram for matrix elements we may “dress” all particle and hole lines as

shown in Fig. 2. We start with a “seed” (“bare”) diagram coming from a certain set of contractions in Eq. (12)

on the topological structure of the product C†C, Eq. (14). Here we focus on the two-body term of this object. The

RPA object (that is dominated by second order in the Coulomb interaction,
is played by the matrix elements of

(cid:1)
matrix elements between core and virtual orbitals; these are to be distinguished from the RPA-like matrix elements,
Eq. (29).

The above derivation is only valid when dressing a single isolated vertex. More complex situation arises whenever
a horizontal cross-cut through a diagram produces several (not just two, as in Fig. 6) unquenched particle and hole
RPA could be attached to the unquenched lines of the
lines. Then the lower particle and hole lines of the object

Here subscript “val. double” indicates that we select a contribution having the same free ends as the R.H.S. of the

i.e., we have demonstrated how to dress the valence doubles. This example can be easily generalized to several equiv-

lines produced by a horizontal cross-cut through a diagram.

Now we specialize our discussion of the RPA-like dressing to the cluster operator truncated at single and double

excitations. In this CCSD approximation we obtain for the bare RPA-like insertion

Notice that one has to be careful when dealing with the ﬁrst (singles × singles) term; it is represented by a disconnected
diagram and may produce undesirable disconnected diagrams for matrix elements, Eq. (10).

By substituting the CCSD insertion, Eq.(32), into Eq. (29) and Eq. (31), we immediately derive expressions for the

dressed matrix elements and the RPA-dressed valence doubles. For example,

Here we omitted a small contribution to ˜cnbma, Eq. (32), from the product of core singles. As discussed in Section VI
this contribution would arise in the higher orders (sixth order) of MBPT.

does not lead to the identical result, because it misses dressing of the w − a vertex. Moreover, we found numerically
that dressing of both vertexes, as in more general Eq. (35), is equally important.

Finally, it is worth noting that with the RPA-like dressing scheme proposed here, the CCSD calculations would
recover the entire chain of RPA diagrams. However, if the calculations of the wavefunctions are done using the
linearized version of the coupled-cluster equations (as in Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6]), a part of the RPA diagrams would still
be missing [3]. To summarize, the inclusion of the CCSD non-linear terms in the CC equations is crucial for a fully
consistent treatment of the RPA sequence.

VI. COMPARISON WITH THE IV-ORDER DIAGRAMS

Coupled cluster method can be straightforwardly connected with the direct order-by-order many-body perturbation
In particular, for univalent systems, when the calculations are carried out starting from the frozen-core

theory.

.

Here gijkl is the matrix element of the residual (beyond the HF potential) Coulomb interaction between the electrons.
It can be shown that while the LCCSD method recovers all third-order diagrams for matrix elements, it starts missing
diagrams in the fourth order of MBPT. Our group has investigated these 1,648 complementary IVth order diagrams
in Refs. [10, 11]. Among the diagrams complementary to LCCSD matrix element contributions, there are seven terms
(class Z1×2 (Dnl) in Ref. [10] ) due to non-linear terms in the expansion of the CCSD wavefunctions. Namely these
Z1×2 (Dnl) diagrams provide the lowest-order approximation for the dressing scheme proposed here.

In Fig. 7 we explore the topological structure of the Z1×2 (Dnl) diagrams. All these diagrams come from various
ways of lowest-order dressing of Z (a)
wv diagram, Eq. (11). A comparison shows that the present dressing approach
recovers ﬁve (three line-dressed and two RPA-dressed) out of seven IVth-order diagrams. The missing diagrams are
shown in the bottom row of Fig. 7, and we call them “stretched” and “ladder” diagrams, the names being derived from
the structure of the highlighted dressing insertions. While the ladder diagram comes from the untreated two-body
contribution to C†C object, Eq. (14), the stretched diagram involves more complex three-body contribution to C†C.
Dressing with these two insertions can be carried out in a way similar to the line- and RPA-like dressing schemes
discussed in this paper and is beyond the scope of the present analysis.

We veriﬁed that in the lowest-order MBPT approximation, Eq. (37), our dressing formulae reproduce the pertinent
IVth-order expressions, explicitly presented in Ref. [10]. Furthermore, in Table I we list numerical values for individual
contributions to magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne structure constant (HFS) A for ground state of 133Cs and E1 transition
amplitude for the principal 6p1/2 − 6s1/2 transition in Cs. Analyzing this Table we conclude that both line– and
RPA–like dressing are equally important. Moreover, for these two particular matrix elements there is a partial
cancelation between the line– and RPA– dressed diagrams, so that were one of the dressings omitted, the result would
be misleading. We also observe that the untreated “ladder” diagram contributes a negligibly small fraction of the
total. At the same time the size of the untreated “stretched” diagram indicates that (at least for the HFS constant)
it is as important as the RPA-like and line-dressed diagrams.

As to the numerics, the IVth-order calculations have been carried out using relativistic B-spline basis sets as
described in Ref. [16]. We used a basis set of 25 out of 30 positive-energy (εi > −mec2) pseudo-eigenfunctions for
each partial wave. Partial waves s1/2 − g9/2 were included in the basis. The summation over intermediate core
orbitals was limited to eight highest energy core orbitals for the E1 amplitude and included all core orbitals for the
HFS constant. The reader is referred to paper [11] for a description of our IVth-order code.

We veriﬁed that numerical results for dressed all-order LCCSD diagrams (see Section VI) are consistent with the
values for the pertinent IVth-order diagrams. As an example consider contributions to A(6s) HFS constant. Line-
dressing modiﬁes the LCCSD Z (a)
wv diagram by −4.3 MHz in a good agreement with a value of −3.8 MHz, the sum
of the ﬁrst three corresponding IVth-order diagrams from Table I. Similarly, RPA-like dressing modiﬁes the Z (a)
wv
diagram by +4.4 MHz, while the sum of IVth-order RPA diagram from Table I is 4.8 MHz.

VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To reiterate discussion so far, we have developed the formalism of line- and RPA-like dressing of the coupled-cluster
diagrams for matrix elements. Further, we reduced our general formalism to the case when the cluster operator is
truncated at single and double excitation amplitudes. We have also veriﬁed that in the lowest order we recover the
relevant fourth-order diagrams both analytically and numerically. In this Section we illustrate our all-order dressing
formalism with numerical results.

We have carried out relativistic calculations of the hyperﬁne-structure (HFS) constant A for the 6s1/2 state and
6s1/2 − 6p1/2 electric-dipole transition amplitude for 133Cs atom. It is worth noting that matrix elements of hyperﬁne
interaction and electric dipole operator allow one to access the quality of ab initio wavefunctions both close to the
nucleus and at intermediate values of electronic coordinate. Such a test is essential for estimates of theoretical
uncertainties of calculations of parity-nonconserving (PNC) amplitudes. The ab initio PNC amplitudes are key for
high-accuracy probes of new physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles with atomic parity violation.
The results of calculations are presented in Tables II and III. In these tables we augment results of the previous all-
order calculations [6] with two types of new contributions: (i) all-order RPA- and line- dressing, outlined in Sections IV
and V, and (ii) complementary fourth-order contributions, so that the results are complete through the fourth-order

perturbation theory. Also, for the HFS constant, we incorporate the most recent values of the Breit and radiative
corrections [17, 18].

LCCSDpT (perturbative triples) approximation. We depart from the results of the coupled-cluster calculation
described in Ref. [6]. These are linearized coupled-cluster calculations, with the wavefunctions truncated at single and
double excitations from the reference Slater determinant. In addition, following Ref. [4], the perturbative eﬀect of
triple excitations has been incorporated into the singles-doubles equation (LCCSDpT method). The main consequence
of this perturbative treatment is that the resulting valence removal energies are complete through the third order
of perturbation energies. There is also a substantial (a few per cent for Cs) improvement in the accuracy of the
resulting LCCSDpT hyperﬁne constants over the LCCSD values. At the same time the theory-experiment agreement
for the E1 amplitudes signiﬁcantly degrades (see Table III): while the LCCSD amplitudes diﬀer by 0.4% from 0.03%-
accurate experimental data [22], the more sophisticated LCCSDpT matrix elements deviate from measurements by
as much as 1.3%. In other words, both LCCSD and LCCSDpT methods are poorly suited for calculating parity-non-
conserving (PNC) amplitudes in 133Cs with uncertainty of a few 0.1%. It is one of the goals of this paper to establish
a method that would provide a consistent accuracy for both HFS constants and dipole matrix elements (and thus
PNC amplitudes).

Procedure. First we solved the relativistic LCCSDpT equations, as described in Ref. [6]. With the computed
cluster amplitudes we calculated LCCSDpT matrix elements and recovered results published in Ref. [6]. Further, we
solved the line-dressing equations (22) and computed the line-dressed cluster amplitudes and matrix elements. The
convergence rate was fast: four iterations were suﬃcient to stabilize the norms of the line-dressed cluster amplitudes
at a level of a few parts per million. Finally, we solved the iterative equation for the RPA-dressed valence amplitudes,
Eq.(33). It turned out to be very computationally intensive part of the scheme and we iterated the equations only once.
We used the computed RPA-dressed valence amplitudes in calculations of the dominant diagram Z (a)
wv , see Eq. (35).
In the remaining diagrams that involve particle-hole matrix elements, we employed RPA-dressed matrix elements
¯zRPA

Line dressing. In Table IV we illustrate the importance of line dressing; in this table we present diﬀerences between
line-dressed and bare LCCSDpT diagrams for the the hyperﬁne constant and E1 amplitude. The dressing of the
leading order HF diagram subsumes the LCCSD diagrams Z (g)
wv, Eq. (25). A direct calculation of these
diagrams results in Z (g)
wv = −22.9 MHz for A(6s) and −1.75 × 10−3 a.u. for the E1 amplitude. These values are
consistent with dressing-induced modiﬁcations of the HF diagram (−22.0 MHz and −1.7 × 10−3 a.u., respectively)
from Table IV. The modiﬁcations of the Z (a)
wv diagram are consistent with the values of the pertinent fourth-order
diagrams, see Section VI and Table I. A large dressing correction for HFS constant comes from the diagram Z (c)
wv; it
is nominally a ﬁfth-order diagram. The relative importance of this diagram is not surprising since it is based upon
Brueckner orbitals (self-energy or core polarization eﬀect). As for the E1 amplitude, the line-dressing correction is
dominated by Z (a)
wv ; i.e., it is dominated by the fourth-order contribution. For the HFS constant, a relative smallness
of the line-dressing correction to Z (a)
wv diagram arises due to a delicate cancelation of relatively large contributions
from dressing of the core, particle and valence lines of the diagram (see Table I). Finally, in the bottom line of the
Table IV we present a diﬀerence between the line-dressed (all diagrams) and bare values. The dressing of the HF
diagram plays a negligible role here, since it is dominated by the diagrams already included in the LCCSDpT values.
The line dressing contributes at a sizable 0.5% level to the HFS constant and at 0.2% level to the E1 amplitude.

Complementary fourth-order diagrams. The LCCSDpT method misses certain many-body diagrams for matrix
elements starting from the fourth-order of MBPT. These complementary corrections in the fourth order come from
triple and disconnected quadruple (or nonlinear double) excitations. In Ref. [10] these corrections were classiﬁed by
the role of triples and disconnected quadruples in the matrix elements (i) an indirect eﬀect of triples and disconnected
quadruples on single and double excitations lumped into class Z0×3; (ii) direct contribution to matrix elements, Z1×2;
(iii) corrections to normalization, Znorm. More reﬁned classiﬁcation reads

Z0×3(Sc[Tc]) + Z0×3(Dv[Tc]) +
Z1×2 (Dnl) + Z0×3 (Dnl) + Znorm(Tv) .

Here we distinguished between valence (Tv) and core (Tc) triples and introduced a similar notation for singles (S)
and doubles (D). Notation like Dv[Tc] stands for eﬀect of core triples (Tc) on valence doubles Dv through an
equation for valence doubles. The LCCSDpT method combines several diagrams from Z1×2(Tv) and Z0×3(Sv[Tv])
classes. We removed these already included diagrams from the fourth-order triples in Tables II and III. Diagrams
Dnl are contributions of disconnected quadruples. As discussed in Section VI namely one of such contributions,
Z1×2 (Dnl), provides the lowest-order approximation to our all-order dressing scheme. In Tables II and III we added
the contributions of untreated “stretched” and “ladder” diagrams of the Z1×2 (Dnl) class and also from Z0×3 (Dnl)
class. The latter contribution would have been accounted for by solving the full (not linearized) CC equations. In
our large-scale fourth-order calculations we have employed the code described in Ref. [11]; all the formulas for a large
number of diagrams and the code have been generated automatically using symbolic algebra tools. While the resulting
fourth-order corrections from triples are at the level of 1%, we notice that there are certain noticeable cancelations
between various diagrams. Thus a complete all-order treatment of triples would be essential for attaining the next
level of theoretical accuracy.

Hyperﬁne constant results. Details of calculation of the hyperﬁne constant A(6s1/2) are presented in Table II. To
clarify the role of correlations, we ﬁrst incorporate a number of small but important eﬀects into the reference value:
Bohr-Weiskopf eﬀect, Breit and radiative corrections. The “LCCSDpT, Coulomb” value has been computed using the
ﬁnite nuclear size, both for determination of wavefunctions and computing matrix elements of hyperﬁne interaction
(this accounts for 0.5%.) We also include Breit corrections from Ref. [17]; these corrections diﬀer substantially
from those incorporated in Ref. [4, 6] due to order-of-magnitude important correlation corrections. Finally, radiative
corrections to magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne-structure constants for the ground state of alkali-metal atoms were computed
recently by Sapirstein and Cheng [18]. They found that the vacuum polarization and self-energy (VP+SE) contribute
as much as 0.4% to the ab initio value. The reader should be careful with adopting Breit values from Ref.[18], because
these values do not include correlation corrections (see Ref. [17] and references therein). The ﬁnal value, marked as
“LCCSDpT Reference” deviates by 0.9% from (exact) experimental value.

Dressing corrections partially cancel, resulting in 0.3% total dressing contribution. Fourth-order diagrams, comple-
mentary to those already included in the LCCSDpT value are dominated by a contribution due to triple excitations
(0.8%). We also include the “stretched” and “ladder” IV-order diagrams missed by our dressing scheme (see Sec-
tion VI). Almost all the correlation corrections are of similar sizes but of diﬀerent signs, so the dressing and IV-th order
corrections cancel, so that the ﬁnal correlation correction is only 0.1%, just slightly improving the theory-experiment
agreement when compared with the “LCCSDpT Reference” value. Our ab initio value for the HFS constant deviates
by 0.8% from the experimental value.

Electric-dipole 6s1/2 − 6p1/2 transition amplitude. Details of calculation for the dipole matrix element are compiled
in Table III. We do not include Breit and radiative corrections in that Table, since the Breit interaction contributes
only 0.02% to this matrix element [17], and radiative corrections are not known from the literature.

There were several high-accuracy experimental determinations of h6p1/2||D||6s1/2i matrix element. We list these
matrix elements in the bottom of Table III. In Refs. [19, 20] this matrix element has been extracted from the measured
lifetime of the 6p1/2 state. Determination of Ref. [22] is based on photoassociative spectroscopy of cold Cs atoms
(i.e., inferred from high-accuracy measurement of molecular potentials). Another approach to extraction of dipole
matrix elements has been proposed by us in Ref. [21]: we exploited an enhanced sensitivity of static electric-dipole
polarizability α(0) of the ground state and van der Waals coeﬃcient C6 of the ground molecular state to the matrix
elements of principal transitions h6p3/2||D||6s1/2i and h6p1/2||D||6s1/2i. Essential to the extraction of individual
matrix elements was a high-accuracy ratio of these two dipole matrix elements measured in Ref. [24]. Based on the
proposed method [21], the h6p1/2||D||6s1/2i matrix element has been deduced from high-accuracy C6 in Ref. [21] and
in Ref. [23] it has been inferred from α(0) measured in that work. The most accurate matrix element comes from
photoassociation spectroscopy [22]; their result has 0.03% accuracy and we will use that value below for calibrating
ab initio calculations.

15

The reference LCCSDpT E1 matrix element deviates from high-accuracy measurements by as much as 1.3%. The
correlation corrections (dressing and fourth-order) computed by us improve the agreement to about 0.6% , i.e., the
ab initio accuracy becomes comparable to that for the HFS constant. An analysis of Table III shows that due to
cancelation of line- and RPA-like-dressing corrections the overall eﬀect of dressing is negligible for this transition
amplitude. At the same time, the forth-order corrections due to triple excitations beyond LCCSDpT triples are very
large, almost 1%. There corrections due to residual fourth-order RPA corrections (Z0×3(Dnl)) are also sizable, and
tend to decrease the eﬀect of triples. Our forth-order calculation demonstrates that a full (beyond that of LCCSDpT)
treatment of triple excitations improves the accuracy of ab initio transition amplitudes.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The main two results of this work are: (i) development and application of all-order dressing formalism for matrix
elements computed with coupled-cluster method; (ii) ﬁrst calculations of matrix elements for Cs complete through
the fourth order of many-body perturbation theory.

To reiterate, our dressing formalism is built upon a hierarchical expansion of the product of clusters C†C into a sum
of n-body insertions. We considered two types of insertions: particle/hole line insertion coming from the one-body
part of the product and two-particle/two-hole RPA-like insertion due to the two-body part. We demonstrated how
to “dress” these insertions and formulated iterative equations. Particular attention has been paid to the singles-
doubles truncation of the full cluster operator and we derived the dressing equations for this popular approximation.
We have upgraded coupled-cluster diagrams for matrix elements with the dressed insertions for univalent systems
and highlighted a relation to pertinent fourth-order diagrams. Finally, we illustrated our formalism with relativistic
calculations for Cs atom.

Our relativistic calculations also include a large number of fourth-order diagrams complementary to LCCSDpT
method (Linearized Coupled-Cluster Single-Doubles method with perturbative treatment of Triples; it is the most
sophisticated CC approximation applied in relativistic calculations for Cs so far). The resulting analysis is complete
through the fourth-order of many-body perturbation theory. We ﬁnd that these complementary diagrams substantially
improve the theory-experiment agreement for an important electric-dipole 6s1/2 − 6p1/2 transition amplitude, and
slightly better the agreement for the hyperﬁne constant. We found sizable cancelations between various fourth-order
contributions; a full all-order treatment of triple and disconnected quadruple excitations is desirable to further improve
the theoretical accuracy.

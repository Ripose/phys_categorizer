We report on an experimental and theoretical study of the dynamic (ac) Stark eﬀect on a forbidden
transition. A general framework for parameterizing and describing oﬀ-resonant ac-Stark shifts is
presented. A model is developed to calculate spectral line shapes resulting from resonant excitation
of atoms in an intense standing light-wave in the presence of oﬀ-resonant ac-Stark shifts. The
model is used in the analysis and interpretation of a measurement of the ac-Stark shifts of the
static-electric-ﬁeld-induced 6s2 1S0 → 5d6s 3D1 transition at 408 nm in atomic Yb. The results
are in agreement with estimates of the ac-Stark shift of the transition under the assumption that
the shift is dominated by that of the 6s2 1
S0 ground state. A detailed description of the experiment
and analysis is presented. A bi-product of this work is an independent determination (from the
saturation behavior of the 408-nm transition) of the Stark transition polarizability, which is found
to be in agreement with our earlier measurement. This work is part of the ongoing eﬀort aimed at
a precision measurement of atomic parity-violation eﬀects in Yb.

INTRODUCTION

Resonant excitation of an atomic transition in an in-
tense standing-wave light ﬁeld can lead to surprisingly
complex and non-trivial spectroscopy. Here we give a de-
tailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the spec-
tral line shapes resulting from oﬀ-resonant ac-Stark shifts
when atoms in an atomic beam are resonantly excited in
such a ﬁeld.

→

Spatial variation of the intense standing-wave light
ﬁeld leads to position- and velocity-dependent ac-Stark
shifts. This results in asymmetric line shapes exhibiting
sub-Doppler features. The attention to this problem was
ﬁrst drawn by Wieman et al. [1] who studied the for-
7S magnetic-dipole (M1) and Stark-induced
bidden 6S
transition in cesium (Cs) in the context of their parity-
violation experiment (see Ref. [2] and references therein).
In this work, we describe our investigation of this ef-
5d6s 3D1 transition in atomic yt-
fect on the 6s2 1S0 →
terbium (Yb). While conceptually similar to the exper-
iment done in Cs, the atomic systems and experimental
arrangements are suﬃciently diﬀerent so we are able to
study the eﬀects in a diﬀerent regime. One of the main
diﬀerences in the two works is that the magnitude of the
ac-Stark shifts are signiﬁcantly larger in Yb than they
are in the Cs transition studied by Wieman et al., while
3 D1 tran-
the natural line width of the forbidden 1S0 →
sition is an order of magnitude smaller. As a result, we
work in the regime where the ac-Stark shifts often sig-
niﬁcantly exceed the natural line width of the transition

[28]. Another key feature of this work is that the Yb
transition studied here is between a J = 0 ground state
and a J ′ = 1 excited state while the Cs transition is
J ′ = 1/2. Thus, in general, diﬀerent tensor
J = 1/2
components of the ac-Stark polarizability play a role in
these two cases. Finally, we are able to study the eﬀect
of the ac-Stark shifts in a regime where saturation eﬀects
become important.

→

Our interest in this problem is related to the ongoing
work in our laboratory on measuring parity nonconser-
vation (PNC) in atomic Yb [3, 4, 5, 6]. Detailed under-
standing of the line shapes with intense standing-wave
excitation, as well as the magnitude of the ac-Stark shifts
of the transition, are of crucial importance for an accu-
rate measurement of parity violation in this transition.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical treatment of
the line shape that generalizes and extends the approach
of Wieman et al.
[1], and is appropriate for the inter-
pretation of our experiments with ytterbium. We also
present a measurement of the ac-Stark shifts for the
5d6s 3D1 transition and discuss our theoret-
6s2 1S0 →
ical modeling of the line shape.

II. THEORY

A. Tensor structure of the ac-Stark polarizabilities

The general tensor structure of ac-Stark polarizabil-
ities has been discussed by various authors (see e.g.
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]). In these works the ac-Stark shifts are
discussed in terms of eﬀective static electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. In this section, we present a parameterization of
the ac-Stark shifts in terms of irreducible spherical com-
ponents in a manner analogous to what is commonly done
for dc-Stark shifts.

Ignoring possible time-reversal-invariance-violation ef-
fects, there is no permanent atomic electric-dipole mo-
ment and, consequently, there is no ﬁrst-order Stark shift.
Using time-dependent second-order perturbation theory
and averaging the energy shift over the period of the light
oscillation gives an energy shift for state

to non-resonant light of [12]

Without referring to speciﬁc intermediate energy lev-
els, we may say that the energy shift of a given atomic
state, being a scalar quantity, must result from a contrac-
tion of irreducible tensors of the same rank describing the
light and the atom. The light tensors are bi-linear in the
components of the light electric-ﬁeld amplitude vector ~ε
and its complex conjugate ~ε∗. The three irreducible ten-
sor components built from ~ε and ~ε∗ are

These three tensor components correspond to the inten-

tively. The vector part of the light tensor, Eq. (3), can

for the circular intensity vector to be nonzero, the light
polarization vector components cannot all be of the same

ishes in the limit of a linearly polarized ﬁeld. As an
example of a non-vanishing circular-intensity vector, for

To obtain a shift of an atomic state, three atomic ten-
sor operators T (κ) of ranks κ = 0, 1, and 2, respectively,
must be contracted with the light tensor components
given in Eqs. (2)-(4), so the ac-Stark shift operator can
be written as

Generally, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (9) are su-
perpositions of the magnetic sublevels. However, if mix-
ing of the diﬀerent magnetic sublevels is negligible, for
example if the magnetic sublevels are split by a suﬃ-
ciently strong dc magnetic ﬁeld, we can ﬁnd the shifts of
the magnetic sublevels by simply evaluating the diagonal
elements of the above Hamiltonian.
In this case, only
the tensor operators with the tensor index q = 0 con-
tribute to the matrix elements. These contract with the
q = 0 components of the electric-ﬁeld tensors. By the
Wigner-Eckart theorem, the atomic matrix elements are
proportional to the matrix elements of operators of the
corresponding rank and index q built from the compo-
ˆ~J. This results in

example, Ref. [13], Section 3.2.2) expressed in Cartesian
components, for example, that the q = 0 component of
T (2) is T (2)

We choose to deﬁne the constants Cn so that the scalar

ac-Stark Shifts on a Stark-Induced Transition

The transition studied in this work is the highly forbid-
5d6s 3D1 transition in atomic Yb (Fig.
den 6s2 1S0 →
1). In the absence of external ﬁelds this transition oc-
curs through a highly suppressed magnetic-dipole (M1)

where µ0 is the Bohr magneton. The above error is re-
duced from that quoted in Ref. [5] due to a reevaluation
of the branching ratios for the decay of the 5d6s 3D1 state
based on the work of Ref. [14].

The ongoing PNC experiment relies upon interference
of a parity-violating transition amplitude with a parity-
conserving E1 amplitude arising from the application of a

dc electric ﬁeld. Since the transition of interest is from a
J = 0 state to a J = 1 state, the Stark-induced amplitude
connecting the ground state and an M sublevel of the
5d6s 3D1 state can be written as

where e is the charge of the electron and a0 is the Bohr

[4] in light of Ref. [14].

For the work discussed here, the Stark-induced E1 am-
plitude is of primary interest. The nature of the Stark-
induced transition leads to a variety of interesting con-
clusions concerning the experimental conﬁgurations re-
quired to access the diﬀerent ac-Stark-shift parameters
αn. We begin by considering the concrete geometry em-
ployed in this experiment with the J = 0
J = 1
transition under study. In this conﬁguration, the light is
linearly polarized at some angle θ relative the dc electric
ﬁeld as shown in Fig. 2. We deﬁne our coordinate system
so that the axis of quantization is along the electric ﬁeld
and the polarization is nominally in the x-z plane (eﬀects
of misalignments are discussed in Section V).

From Eq. (14) we see that with this geometry, the light

excites the state

which is a state aligned along the y axis, regardless of the
polarization angle θ.

This state is an eigenstate of both the dc- and ac-Stark
perturbations, as can be seen by considering their Hamil-
tonians, which are of the form of Eq. (9). Because the
electric ﬁeld vector E does not have a y component, the
Hamiltonian (9) is a linear combination of the operator
products that transform as JiJj with i, j = x, z. Tak-
ing the quantization axis along y, the matrix elements
of these products can be written in terms of the matrix
elements of products of pairs of the raising and lower-
ing operators. Such products will only mix states with
∆My = 0, 2, so the My = 0 state is not mixed with
My = 1,
1. The My = 0 state remains an energy eigen-
state of both interactions acting simultaneously and its
energy does not depend on the angle of the polarization
of the light relative to the dc electric ﬁeld. Based on the
Eqs. (16), (11), and (12), the energy shift of this state is

Here we have used the superscripts ac and dc to distin-
guish between the static and dynamic polarizabilities (we
omit the superscripts where the meaning of a symbol is
clear from the context). We conclude that with the cur-
rent conﬁguration of ﬁelds, the experiment is only sen-
sitive to the combination of ac-Stark parameters deﬁned
in Eq. (17). However, it is possible to observe diﬀerent
components of the ac-Stark shifts using diﬀerent conﬁg-
urations of ﬁelds. While not directly relevant for the
measurement described here, we brieﬂy discuss the mod-
iﬁcations which would be necessary to isolate the scalar,
vector, and tensor polarizabilities.

Perhaps the simplest modiﬁcation one can envision in
order to separate the scalar and tensor shifts is to apply a
strong magnetic ﬁeld along the z axis. This provides the
strong leading ﬁeld needed to make Eq. (12) valid. In this
case, the Mz =
1 and Mz = +1 magnetic sublevels are
excited independently. As can be seen from Eq. (12), the
ac-Stark shift of the two states will depend on the angle
of the polarization of the light with respect to the dc-
electric ﬁeld. Measuring the shift at diﬀerent polarization
angles then allows one to separate the scalar and tensor
components.

−

In order to measure the vector ac-Stark shift parame-
ter, one must use circularly polarized light since the shift
depends on Im(ε∗
xεy) [see Eqs. (6) and (12)]. Further-
more, the light must propagate non-orthogonally to the
axis of quantization in order to have a nonzero compo-
nent of the polarization-intensity vector along the quan-
tization axis. These conditions can be achieved by using
circularly polarized light and applying the electric ﬁeld
along the axis of light propagation. With such an ar-
rangement, only one magnetic sublevel, either My = +1
or My =
1, is excited and the shift of the level would
be a combination of the scalar, vector, and tensor shifts.

C. Estimate of Ground-State Shift

The shift of the transition frequency is due to shifts in
both the 6s2 1S0 ground state and 5d6s 3D1 excited state.
Since the ground state has angular momentum J = 0,
it can only have a scalar shift. In contrast, the excited
state can have all scalar, vector, and tensor components.
The ac-Stark shift is resonantly enhanced for eigen-
states with energy separations nearby the frequency of
the light.
In addition, the eﬀect depends quadrat-
ically on the dipole coupling of the states involved.

The shift of the ground state can be estimated us-
ing Eq. (1) and reducing the sum to include only the

The shift of the 5d6s 3D1 state is signiﬁcantly harder to
estimate. It is possible that there is an odd-parity eigen-
state with energy close to twice the energy of a 408-nm
photon, which can lead to resonantly enhanced shifts of
the 5d6s 3D1 state. The energy spectrum in this region
(which is below the Yb ionization limit) is very dense
due to the excitation of 4f orbitals [16]. While the ac-
Stark shifts of the 5d6s 3D1 state due to the known en-
ergy eigenstates are estimated to lead to shifts which are
signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the ground state, the
knowledge of the energy spectrum is far from complete
in this region. This provides one of the motivations for
determining the ac-Stark polarizabilities experimentally.

citation light were varied. A numerical calculation based
on the density-matrix formalism was used to generate
spectral line shapes for diﬀerent values of the ac-Stark
polarizabilities. The data were ﬁt to these line shapes in
order to extract a combination of the ac-Stark polariz-
abilities for the transition.

A stainless-steel oven with a multi-channel nozzle was

a vacuum chamber with a residual background pressure

tantalum-wire heaters placed inside ceramic tubes (alu-
mina AD-998; Coors Ceramic). The oven was operated

B. Electric Field

The dc electric ﬁeld was produced by applying voltage
to a pair of plates which were the same as those used in
Refs. [4, 5]. The plates were made of stainless steel and
were 0.79 cm thick, 8.9 cm along the direction of the laser
beam, and 3.2 cm in the direction of the atomic beam.
The edges of the plates were rounded to a 0.3 cm radius
and electropolished to avoid discharge. The plates were
oriented so as to provide a vertical electric ﬁeld and were
separated with two Delrin spacers. The separation of the
plates was 1.016 cm. A depression was cut into the top
electrode and an array of holes was drilled into the plate
in order to collect the ﬂuorescence (see Refs. [4, 5] for
further details).

For the work described in Ref. [4], the eﬀect of the holes
on the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld was calculated. It
was found that the holes reduced the electric ﬁeld by less
than 1%. The exact correction was not determined due to
uncertainties in the surface charges of the dielectric light
guide that was placed into the depression to measure the
ﬂuorescence. We therefore, conservatively estimate a 1%
error in our knowledge of the magnitude of the electric
ﬁeld. The value of the applied ﬁeld was monitored with
a precision high-voltage divider.

C. Residual Magnetic Field

The magnetic ﬁeld from the earth was partially com-
pensated using three sets of magnetic coils wrapped
around the vacuum chamber. We estimate that the
residual magnetic ﬁeld was trimmed down to a level of

50 mG.

The cavity was designed as a symmetric two-mirror
resonator with mirror radii of curvature of 25 cm. The
cavity-mirror separation was 26.01(6) cm and the light
was coupled in to the TEM00 transverse cavity mode.

The cavity consisted of two high-quality mirrors
mounted on precision optical mounts. The mirror mounts
were attached to a Super-Invar rod supported by lead
blocks designed to damp vibrations.

The transmission of the mirrors was measured directly
using a Newport 841-PE power meter with an 818-SL
head. The incident power was measured with a calibrated
attenuator (833-SL); the attenuator was removed for the
measurement of the power transmitted. The power meter

is calibrated to

In order to determine the amount of power coupled into
the cavity we monitored the light coming oﬀ of the input
coupler of the cavity. This light consists of light that is

not mode matched to the cavity as well as light due to
an imperfect cancelation of the cavity leakage ﬁeld with
the light rejected from the cavity mirror. If we couple a

The ﬁrst term in this equation is due to the imperfect

This is in reasonable agreement with the experimentally

ode and the photodiode voltage was calibrated with the
same calibrated power meter used to measure the trans-
mission of the mirror.

E. Laser-Frequency Locking and Stabilization

≈

Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the laser locking
system. A Coherent 899 Ti:Saphire laser was pumped
by
12 W from a Spectra Physics 2080 argon-ion
laser operating on all lines. The Ti:Sapphire laser pro-
duced
1.2 W of light at 816 nm. This light was
frequency doubled using a commercial bow-tie resonator
with a Lithium-Triborate crystal (Laser Analytical Sys-
tems Wavetrain cw) to produce the 408-nm light needed
to excite the transition. The output of the frequency
doubler was

80 mW.

≈

In order to increase the bandwidth of the frequency
lock and narrow the line width of the laser to match that
of the power-build-up cavity, an EOM was placed inside
the laser cavity. The EOM used was a double-crystal
assembly from LINOS Optics (PM 25 IR). The EOM
was driven by a homemade electronics circuit.

The laser was locked to the power-build-up cavity using
the fm-sideband technique [19]. The laser beam passed

through an EOM (ConOptics 370) to which rf power of
4 W at 28 MHz was coupled via a resonant LC circuit.
The laser beam was coupled on axis to the power-build-
up cavity. The beam passed through a glass plate which
picked oﬀ a small fraction of the light rejected from the
input coupler of the cavity. This light was sent to an
ampliﬁed fast photodiode (New Focus 1801, bandwidth
125 MHz). The signal from the photodiode was ampliﬁed
and mixed down with the local oscillator to produce the
error signal used to control the laser frequency.

In order to improve absolute frequency stability, the
resonant frequency of the cavity was locked to a her-
metically sealed, temperature-stabilized confocal Fabry-
Perot interferometer at 816 nm (Burleigh CFT-500) with
a free-spectral range of 150 MHz using a similar fm-
sideband lock as that described above. The error signal
from this locking system was sent to a high-voltage am-
pliﬁer which controlled the piezo-ceramic-mounted mir-
ror of the power-build-up cavity. Thus, the stable cavity
provided the master frequency, with the power-build-up
cavity serving as the secondary master for the laser. The
frequency of the laser system was scanned over the proﬁle
of the atomic resonance by scanning the primary master
Fabry-Perot cavity. Feed forward was sent to both the
power-build-up cavity and the laser to help them track
the frequency scans.

F. Fluorescence Detection

The number of atoms excited to the 5d6s 3D1 state
was monitored by observing the ﬂuorescence of the
6s2 1S0 transition at 556 nm. A lucite light
6s6p 3P1 →
guide was used to send the ﬂuorescent light to a photo-
multiplier tube (PMT, Burle 8850) outside of the vac-
uum chamber. A narrow-band interference ﬁlter, cen-
tered around 560 nm, with a pass band of 10 nm was
placed on the front of the photomultiplier tube to re-
duce the scattered light reaching the PMT. The overall

7

∼

detection eﬃciency was such that
0.05% of the atoms
undergoing the 408-nm transition produced photoelec-
trons at the PMT photocathode. The photocathode was
operated at
1750 V. The gain of the tube was measured
−
106 at this voltage. The PMT current was
to be
fed into a Stanford Research Systems current preampli-
ﬁer (SRS 570). The voltage output was recorded with a
digital oscilloscope and saved to a computer.

G. Frequency Reference

Since the experiment relies on a detailed understand-
ing of the spectral line shape of the transition over a
region of
100 MHz, a frequency reference with closely
spaced frequency markers is needed. To this end, we
have constructed a Fabry-Perot interferometer operating
at 408 nm. The mirror spacing was chosen so that the
transverse cavity modes overlap at frequency intervals of

the α which appears here is given by

α0(408 nm, 3D1) + α2(408 nm, 3D1)

α0(408 nm, 1S0).

The spatial variation of the electric ﬁeld translates into
a temporal variation as an atom passes through the laser
beam. The electric-ﬁeld amplitude inside the cavity is a

resonances of 55.12 MHz.

IV. CALCULATION OF LINE SHAPE

A. Numerical Modeling

→

For a J = 0

J ′ = 1 transition, there are gener-
ally four magnetic sublevels which must be included in
a calculation. However, as discussed in Section II B, the
orientations of ﬁelds used in this experiment lead to ex-
citation of a single energy eigenstate which is a superpo-
sition of the My =
1 sublevels. Thus, we can neglect
the structure of the upper state and treat the excitation
of the atoms as a two-level problem.

±

The calculation was done using the density-matrix for-
malism. The Hamiltonian consists of the usual dipole
coupling between the two states with an additional term
along the diagonal which describes the energy shifts due
to the ac-Stark eﬀect

Here, d is the dipole matrix element coupling the states,
α is the ac-Stark parameter, and ε(x, t) = ε(x)cos(ωt)
is the oscillating electric ﬁeld of the standing wave. We
neglect the small residual running wave component of the
ﬁeld inside the cavity as it is
1000 times smaller than
the standing wave component. The function ε(x) is the
amplitude of the oscillating electric ﬁeld as a function of
position. Since we are considering a two-level system,
the tensor structure of the ac-Stark interaction is not

where we have chosen t = 0 to be when the atom is in the
middle of the laser beam. We have neglected vz t since
the change in z as an atom crosses the laser beam is
small. The largest angle an atom can have in the vertical
direction and still intersect the laser beam is

θV =

0.014,

h
2L ≈

(35)

where h = 0.64 cm is the vertical dimension of the nozzle
and L = 23 cm is the distance between the nozzle and the
interaction region. This means that the vertical position
of the atom changes by only
3% of the laser beam
diameter as the atom crosses the beam.

≈

A computer code was written in the programming lan-
guage C to numerically solve the Louiville density-matrix
equations (see for example Ref.
[22], Ch. 15). The
rotating-wave approximation was applied, and the equa-
tions were solved for the upper-state population using
the semi-implicit Euler method [23]. The program calcu-
lated the spectral line shape by integrating the density-
matrix equations in time for atoms with a given trans-
verse atomic-beam velocity vy, longitudinal atomic-beam
velocity vx, initial z0 position, and initial y0 position.
The program then integrated over each of these param-
eters with the proper distribution functions to arrive at
the complete spectral line shape [29].

The upper-state population was integrated from a time
3 √2 r0/vx to tf = +3 √2 r0/vx, where r0 is the
ti =
e−1 electric-ﬁeld radius. The time integral was extended
after tf to include an exponential decay with a decay

−

time given by the lifetime of the 5d6s 3D1 state. The
integration over the z0 position, or vertical position of
the atom relative to the laser beam, was performed from
zi = 0 to zf = 3 √2 r0. Calculations using these inte-
gration ranges were found to give consistent results with
calculations with larger integration ranges.

The integration over the initial y0 position was done
by replacing the 2 πy0/λ factor in the standing wave by
a phase. Since the intensity of the standing wave repeats
every π/2, the integration in this phase was from 0 to π/2.
Atoms traveling at large velocity vy see many periods
of the standing wave as they traverse the laser beam.
For this reason, the initial phase has little eﬀect on the
resulting signal. Thus for atoms with a magnitude of
vy
|
|
larger than a certain maximum value, the phase was set
to 0 and the signal was not integrated over the phase.
The magnitude of the maximum velocity was empirically
chosen to be 1.5
λ/(2π), where Γ0 is the natural
linewidth of the transition.

recorded without the power-build-up cavity. This empir-
ically determined line shape was then used as the input
for the calculation.

A signiﬁcant amount of eﬀort was put into optimizing
the program so that it was realistic to perform numerous
calculations with diﬀerent ac-Stark shift parameters and
electric-ﬁeld amplitudes. The time it took to perform a
calculation varied depending on the values of α and ε.

B. Calculated Line Shapes

Experimental data were taken at a variety of diﬀerent
light powers and dc-electric ﬁelds. The maximum electric
ﬁeld of the standing wave was varied between 1.5 and
7.5 kV/cm, and the dc electric ﬁeld was varied between
5 and 15 kV/cm. Over this range of ﬁeld values the line
shape changes quite signiﬁcantly.

Figure 4 shows the calculated line shapes for four dif-
ferent light powers (corresponding to the amplitudes of
the light electric ﬁeld ε0 shown in the ﬁgure), with a
dc electric ﬁeld of 5 kV/cm. The ac-Stark parameter
assumed for these calculations is that estimated for the
ground-state shift, α = 0.28Hz/(V/cm)2. Figure 5 shows

Stark-shift parameter, but a dc electric ﬁeld of 15 kV/cm.
In both ﬁgures, the calculated signals have been divided
by the square of the maximum electric ﬁeld of the light.
While the details of the line shapes are quite compli-
cated, the basic shape can be understood qualitatively
by considering several diﬀerent eﬀects. The ﬁrst eﬀect
we discuss is the saturation of the transition. Despite
10−4 e a0
the smallness of the transition amplitude (
at 15 kV/cm), the intense standing wave present at the
highest light powers used in the experiment is suﬃcient
to saturate the transition. This is clearly observed in the
decrease of the power-normalized signal size as the power
is increased. The eﬀect is more pronounced for the calcu-
lations at a dc electric ﬁeld of 15 kV/cm than for those at
5 kV/cm due to the increased Stark-induced amplitude
at the higher electric ﬁeld.

≈

×

9

In addition to the overall decrease in the signal size,
saturation also leads to hole-burning in the velocity dis-
tribution. The width of the dip is comparable to the
homogeneous line width, which, in this case, is the power-
broadened width.

While hole-burning changes the spectral line shape, it
does not make the line shape asymmetric around zero
detuning. To understand the asymmetry of the line shape
we must include the eﬀects of the ac-Stark shift. As can
be seen from Figs. 4 and 5, the eﬀect of the ac-Stark shift
is not uniform over the proﬁle of the line, suggesting a
dependence on the atoms’ transverse velocity.

The source of the asymmetry can be understood in
terms of an apparent frequency modulation resulting
from the ac-Stark shifts. As the atoms travel through
the laser beam the resonance frequency of the transition
shifts depending on the intensity of the local light ﬁeld.
From an atom’s perspective this is equivalent to a fre-
quency modulation of the laser light.

The depth of the frequency modulation (i.e., the max-
imum frequency shift) is determined by the magnitude of
the ac-Stark shift and is given by

two “carrier” frequencies,

With the estimated ground-state shift and light pow-
ers used in the experiment, the depth of the modula-
tion ranges between 0.28 and 7.4 MHz. The frequency of
the modulation (as the atom moves between peaks and
valleys of the standing light wave) is determined by the
transverse velocity

where ∆νD is the Doppler shift of an atom moving with
transverse velocity vy. The factor of two in the above
equation arises from the fact that the ac-Stark shift is
quadratic so that the period of the shift is half that of
the wave length of the light.

Since the apparent frequency of the modulation is de-
termined by the transverse velocity [Eq. (38)], the eﬀect
is quite diﬀerent for atoms with diﬀerent vy. The trans-
verse velocities where the character of the frequency mod-
ulation changes, depend on the size of the ac-Stark shift,
and, as discussed below, on the homogeneous line width
of the transition.

The character of frequency modulation is determined
by the relative size of the depth of the modulation and
In the case where
the frequency of the modulation.
ξ/2 << Ω, frequency modulation is characterized by
the appearance in the spectrum of the light-frequency
detuning as perceived by the moving atom of principal
sidebands located at
Ω of the fundamental frequency.
The sign of the amplitude of the sidebands is opposite
for the high- and low-frequency sidebands. As the depth
of the modulation is increased, the sidebands increase
and higher-order sidebands develop. Eventually, the bulk

±

of the amplitude shifts away from the fundamental fre-
quency to the extreme frequencies. This evolution is
shown in Fig. 6 for the electric-ﬁeld amplitude and in-
tensity of the light (proportional to the square of the
amplitude).

An atom with a transverse velocity vy = ∆νD λ sees

∆νD
ν1 = ν0 −
ν2 = ν0 + ∆νD,

(39)
(40)

corresponding to the Doppler shifts of the two counter-
propagating waves which make up the standing wave.
Since the resonant frequency of the transition is modu-
lated, the detuning of the atomic resonance relative to
the light frequency acquires sidebands. From the atom’s
perspective, this appears as sidebands spaced a distance
2∆νD around ν1 and ν2. Thus, the high-frequency side
band of ν1 overlaps with ν2 and the low-frequency side
band of ν2 overlaps with ν1. However, since the high-
frequency sideband for ν1 is positive, while the low-
frequency sideband of ν2 is negative, there is a reduction
of the amplitude at ν1 and an enhancement at ν2. This
∆νD. As
leads to asymmetries in the resonant peaks at
the transverse velocity is increased, the amplitude of the
sidebands decreases and the height of the two Doppler-
shifted resonances evens out.

±

Atoms with small transverse velocity pass through the
laser beam without traversing multiple nodes and anti-
nodes of the standing wave. The nature of the mod-
ulation is therefore not sinusoidal for these atoms, and
cannot be parameterized in terms of Ω. The atoms

x
x
x
W
≈

experiencing this regime have transverse velocities cor-
responding to Doppler shifts less than the transit line
200 kHz. Furthermore, if Ω is less than
width which is
the homogeneous line width (determined in this case by
the power-broadened width), then the eﬀects of the fre-
quency modulation are smeared out. For these reasons,
the regime of harmonic modulation where Ω is much
smaller than ξ/2 is never realized in the system under
consideration.

Even if the atoms move exactly perpendicular to the
light, there is spectral asymmetry due to the spatial de-
pendence of the ac-Stark shift – the shift is diﬀerent de-
pending on the phase of the light wave the atoms see
(determined by the y coordinate), and on the position of
the atoms in the x-z plane.

The resulting spectrum is the sum of all velocity
classes, this sum leads to asymmetries near the center
of the spectra shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

V. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Line shapes of the type shown in Figs. 4 and 5 were
generated over the appropriate range of transition am-
plitudes and a range of ac-Stark-shift parameters. The
calculated line shapes were used to create an interpolat-
ing function in frequency, the ac-Stark-shift-parameter,
and transition amplitude.

The calculations were related to the experimental spec-
tral line shapes using the following parameterization of
the calculations

νc)),

where a is the amplitude of the signal, and the function
f (ε0, α, β, E, θ, s(ν
νc)) is the calculated line shape
for a maximum electric ﬁeld of the optical standing wave
of ε0, ac-Stark shift polarizability α, Stark-transition po-
larizability β, dc electric ﬁeld E, polarization angle θ,
and frequency s(ν
νc), centered around νc. The fre-
quency term includes a multiplicative scaling factor s.
This s parameter was introduced in order to account for
any variation in the overall width of the data relative to
the calculation. Such a variation might arise due to a
misalignment of the atomic beam relative to the axis of
the power-build-up cavity or a deviation of the velocity
distribution from that measured without the cavity. We
note that the parameters in Eq. (41) are not indepen-
dent. Aside from scale and oﬀset parameters, the calcu-
lated line shape depends only on the Rabi frequency of
the transition (ΩR = β E ε0 sinθ) and the ac-Stark shift

responding to a maximum light electric ﬁeld inside the
cavity of 2 to 7.4 kV/cm). Data were taken at a total of
45 diﬀerent ﬁeld parameters.

The maximum light electric ﬁeld inside the cavity, ε0,
was determined using the measured power transmitted
through the cavity and the experimentally determined
transmission coeﬃcient of the cavity mirrors [Eq. (19)].
The dc-electric ﬁeld was measured using the voltage
divider mentioned in Section III B. The value of the
Stark transition polarizability was ﬁxed in the analysis
10−8 e a0/(V/cm) [see Eq. (15)]. Eﬀects
at β = 2.18
arising from the uncertainty in β, as well as an indepen-
dent evaluation of β from the present data are discussed
below.

The power-normalized scans were individually ﬁt to
Eq. (41). Typical scans and ﬁts for three diﬀerent com-
binations of dc electric ﬁeld and laser light power are
shown in Fig. 7. For a given power and dc electric ﬁeld
the mean ﬁt values of a set of scans were determined,
and the distribution of the values was used to estimate
the statistical error. The overall result, including sets at
all of the dc-electric ﬁelds, polarization angles, and light
powers used in the experiment is

where the error is determined from the statistical errors
in each set of scans. The reduced chi squared for the
data is 3.18 for 45 points. The large reduced chi squared
is primarily due to inconsistency in the data taken at
a dc electric ﬁeld of 15 kV/cm with the data taken at
lower ﬁelds. Table I shows the results for the diﬀerent dc
electric ﬁelds and Fig. 8 shows the dc-ﬁeld dependence
of the ac-Stark shift parameter.

The discrepancy is also apparent in the s parameter
described above. The s parameter has a clear dependence
on the dc-electric ﬁeld, going from s = 0.984(3) at 5
kV/cm to s = 0.9535(6) at 15 kV/cm. A value of the s
parameter less than unity corresponds to an experimental
line shape which is broader than the line shape calculated
assuming s = 1.

This broadening of the line shape might suggest that
the inconsistency in the data is a result of not properly
accounting for saturation eﬀects. However, there is no
clear dependence of the extracted ac-Stark shift value on
the light power, which one would expect if the saturation
eﬀects were the source of the discrepancy.

We analyzed the data in a number of diﬀerent ways in
order to understand this discrepancy as well as estimate
systematic errors from calculational assumptions. The
results of these investigations are tabulated in Tab. II
and are discussed below.

The ac-Stark shift and the value of the Stark transition
polarizability, β, are highly correlated in the parametriza-
tion of the spectral line shape. The eﬀects of the uncer-
tainty in the value of β were investigated by reanalyzing

diﬀerent values of β. The results of this analysis are
shown in Tab. II. Figure 9 shows the dependence of
the ac-Stark shift parameter on the dc electric ﬁeld for
the diﬀerent values of the Stark transition polarizabil-
ity. This analysis reveals a deﬁnite dependence of the
ac-Stark shift parameter determined from the analysis
on the value of β. Furthermore, the discrepancy between
the 15 kV/cm data and the lower ﬁeld data was reduced
when the data were analyzed with a value of the Stark
10−8 e a0/(V/cm).
transition polarizability of β = 2.28
However, the data are still inconsistent with reduced chi-
squared of 2.46 for 45 points. This analysis suggests
that the value of the Stark transition polarizability may
be higher than the central value in Eq. (15), although
consistent within the quoted uncertainty. Below, we de-
scribe a procedure for determining the value of the Stark
transition polarizability from these data. This analysis
provides a determination of the uncertainty in the ac-
Stark shift parameter resulting from the uncertainty in
β. Based on the results presented in Tab. II, we arrive at
an uncertainty in the ac-Stark shift due to uncertainty in
β of 5%.

×

Another possible source of experimental error arises
from uncertainties in the atomic velocity distribution
along the axis of the power build-up cavity. This uncer-
tainty is the motivation for introducing the s parameter
described above and is highly correlated with it. The
fact that the s parameter is less than unity suggests that
the center velocity of the atomic beam is not exactly
perpendicular to the cavity axis. To analyze the eﬀects
of such a misalignment, the calculation described above
was modiﬁed to include a Doppler distribution which was
misaligned from the axis of the power-build-up cavity by
0.14◦. This misalignment corresponds to a Doppler shift
of the two counter-propagating light waves constituting
the standing wave by
2 MHz, respectively, as seen from
the point of view of the atoms in the atomic beam moving
with the most probable velocity. Misalignments larger

±

12

than this lead to noticeable eﬀects in the velocity distri-
bution which were not present in the experimental data.
We believe this to be an upper limit on the possible mis-
alignment. The data were analyzed as before; the results
are presented in Tab. II. From these we determine that
the uncertainty in the ac-Stark shift parameter due to
the uncertainties in the alignment of the atomic beam
with the cavity axis are 2%. The values of the s parame-
ter resulting from this analysis ranged from 1.05 for E=5
kV/cm to 1.01 for E=15 kV/cm.

We also investigated the eﬀect of including the s pa-
rameter in the ﬁt. We analyzed a fraction of the data
(27 sets) ﬁxing the s parameter to unity. The ﬁts using
this procedure were not as good as the ﬁts where s was
allowed to vary. In this case, the values of the ac-Stark
shift parameter are largely determined by the wings of
the Doppler distribution, since that is the only parame-
ter available to broaden the line shape. The result of this
analysis is shown in Tab. II.

[26]).

The longitudinal velocity distribution used in the cal-
culation is also a possible source of uncertainty. We as-
sume a standard longitudinal velocity distribution of ef-
fusive atoms escaping from a hole of [Eq. (36)], with the
temperature ﬁxed by the measured temperature at the
rear (i.e., the coldest part) of the oven. However, atomic
beams frequently deviate from this textbook distribution
due to preferential scattering of the slow atoms (the so-
called Esterman eﬀect, see, for example, a discussion in
In addition, the oven is not at a uniform
Ref.
temperature; the temperature varies by over 100 ◦C from
front to back of the oven. This variation in tempera-
ture can modify the observed velocity distribution of the
atomic beam. In order to investigate the eﬀects of uncer-
tainty in the longitudinal velocity distribution, data were
analyzed using calculations assuming velocity distribu-
tions corresponding to diﬀerent temperatures. The ex-
tracted values of the ac-Stark shift parameter are shown
in Tab. II. Assuming a maximal deviation in the central
temperature of 100◦, we arrive at an uncertainty in the
ac-Stark shift parameter of about 5%.

Another key assumption in the calculation is that the
problem can be reduced to that involving just two atomic
levels. If the dc electric ﬁeld and light ﬁeld are the only
ﬁelds present and are aligned appropriately, this is a cor-
rect assumption (see Sect. IV). However, if there are
additional ﬁelds present, such as a magnetic ﬁeld, this as-
sumption may break down. With the experimental geom-
etry used here (Fig. 2) the strong dc electric applied along

states and the two-level treatment would be incorrect.
To investigate this possibility, we utilized the magnetic-
ﬁeld coil normally used to compensate the ambient ﬁeld
in the z-direction to apply a magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the
dc electric ﬁeld. Data were then taken at diﬀerent val-
ues of magnetic ﬁelds, which were analyzed as described
above. The results are shown in Fig. 10. At large values
of the magnetic ﬁeld (
1 G), there is a dependence in
the extracted value of the ac-Stark shift parameter as ex-
pected. However, no dependence was observed for data
taken at magnetic ﬁeld values that might realistically be
present in the experiment. Thus, using the errors for
the data taken with varying magnetic ﬁeld we estimate
the uncertainty in the ac-Stark shift parameter due to
residual magnetic-ﬁeld eﬀects to be < 3%.

≈

Misalignment of the optical ﬁeld relative to the dc-
electric ﬁeld can also lead to a splitting of the energy
eigenstates that are excited. With the geometry used in
this experiment (Fig. 2), there are two possible kinds of
such misalignment. One is an error in the angle between
light ﬁeld and dc electric ﬁeld. Since the ac-Stark shift
does not depend on the angle of the light ﬁeld relative
to the dc ﬁeld in this geometry (see Sect. II B), a mis-
alignment of this kind does not lead to a breakdown of
the two-level approximation, but changes the transition
matrix element [Eq. (14)]. In the other kind of misalign-
ment, the cavity axis has a component along the dc elec-
tric ﬁeld. In this case, the assumption of a two-level sys-
tem generally breaks down. However, for the case where
the light ﬁeld is polarized along the x-axis, the dc electric
ﬁeld and the light ﬁeld remain perpendicular. Thus, the
above argument that was used to reduce the problem to
that involving just two atomic levels is valid in this case,
and the misalignment does not aﬀect the extracted value
of the ac-Stark-shift parameter. For a general polariza-
tion, a misalignment could inﬂuence the ac-Stark shift
measurement. We can place a limit on the uncertainties
arising from such possible misalignment by comparing
the extracted ac-Stark-shift parameters for data taken

In an attempt to determine the value of

from the
data, we also analyzed the results using a global ﬁt of
all data. In addition, the values of the Stark transition
polarizability [Eq.
(15)] and the frequency scaling pa-
rameter s directly aﬀect the extracted value of the ac-
Stark polarizabilities. In order to properly account for
this correlation, the variance of the data with the calcu-
lation was simultaneously minimized with respect to all
three of these parameters. The data were analyzed by
varying α, β, and s and ﬁtting the individual data scans
to the amplitude, a, and the center position νc. For a
given set of α, β, and s the χ2 of the individual ﬁts were
summed. This gave a global “χ2 map,” using which a
minimum was found with respect to α, β, and s.

The value of the minimum of the global χ2 was nor-
malized to unity. The errors were assigned by deter-
mining the deviations in α, β, and s required to give
a χ2 = 1 + 1/N , where N is the total number of data
points used in all of the ﬁts, and taking the appropriate
projections along α, β, and s. The results for the data
grouped by ﬁeld conﬁgurations as well as the result of a
global ﬁt to all of the data are shown in Tab. IV.

There is good agreement between the results deter-
mined from the chi-squared map and the result deter-
mined from the ﬁts to the individual data sets. Again,
there is a discrepancy between the diﬀerent electric-ﬁeld
sets. In addition, the extracted value of the Stark tran-
sition polarizability β is inconsistent among the diﬀerent
electric ﬁeld sets. Using the spread as an estimate of
the uncertainty, we arrive at a measurement of the Stark
transition polarizability of

VI. CONCLUSION

The results of the measurement of the ac-Stark shift of
the 6s2 1S0 →
5d6s 3D1 transition at 408 nm [Eq. (45)]
are in good agreement with estimates of the ac-Stark
shift of the 6s2 1S0 ground state [Eq. (18)]. The value of
the ac-Stark shifts of this transition should not limit our
ability to study parity nonconserving eﬀects: the broad-
ening due to ac-Stark shifts will not preclude resolving
Zeeman components of the transition as necessitated by
the current PNC-experiment scheme, and the present re-
search has shown that lineshapes can be understood and
modeled (see Fig. 7). In the future high-precision PNC
experiments it will be necessary to work with a higher-
ﬁnesse cavity. In that case, it may be possible to reduce
the ac-Stark shifts by operating the cavity in the confocal
regime, and expanding the laser beam to simultaneously
excite a large number of the degenerate transverse modes.
An additional result of the present work is a new in-
dependent determination of the Stark transition polar-
izability β. The result [Eq. 46] is consistent with the
earlier result [Eq. 15] of Ref. [4] and has comparable un-
certainty, but it does not rely on the knowledge of the
decay branching ratios of the 5d6s 3D1 state.

[28] The work of Ref. [27] utilized an optical cavity with a
larger power-build-up factor than that used in Ref. [1].
Using the power and cavity parameters reported in Ref.
[27], we estimate the maximum ac-Stark shifts were 16
MHz, while the natural line width of the transition is 3.3
MHz.

[29] For simplicity, we neglect correlations between longitu-
dinal and transverse velocity distributions in the atomic
beam. Estimated errors resulting from this approxima-
tions are included in the error budgets presented in Sec-
tion V.

[30] Additionally, if this eﬀect were to be the problem, one
would expect larger internal inconsistencies in the data
taken at low rather than at high dc electric ﬁeld where
the dc-Stark shifts are small. This is opposite to what we
actually observed.

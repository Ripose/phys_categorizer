1 Introduction

Calculation of the light-shifts of both the ground and excited states of the
atoms are mostly easily performed in the formalism of the so-called “dressed”
atom (see e.g. [1]). Within the framework of this approach the shift, ∆εn, of
the level n occurring due to the incident photon beam of the energy, ω, and
polarization, e, is deﬁned as follows:

Here Di denotes the ith component of the vector of the dipole moment. An ab
initio exact analytical calculation of DP is evidently possible for hydrogenic
systems only and the corresponding results are known (in principle) for all
states already for long time (see [4] and references herein). They are usually
performed by means of the exact explicit expression for the non-relativistic
Green’s function either in coordinate or momentum spaces. As a result, DP
are expressed in terms of the special (Appel) functions whose complicated
mathematical structure makes accurate numerical (and analytical) analysis
of αij
n (ω) hard to carry out. Especially this argument refers to the case when
the photon energy, ω, lies in the vicinity of the threshold: ω
In
being the ionization potential of the state n. It is not surprising, therefore,
that calculations of this type seem to be available for the hydrogenic 1s-
state only (see [5]). In fact, provided that the principal quantum number,
n, of the level is ﬁxed, αij
n (ω) has singularities when the photon energy,
ω, is in the resonance with the higher/lower discrete levels of the atom 1:

n ω) is the total photoionization cross section of the
state with the principal quantum number, n, and α = e2/(¯hc) = 1/137 is
the ﬁne structure constant. In mathematical terms, αij
n (ω) has unremovable
singularity at the point ω = In, so that a great care must be taken to make
numerical calculation within this region of ω stable and highly accurate.
The most eﬃcient way of achieving that consists in combining numerical
methods together with analytical ones. It is relevant to point out that the
detailed description of the DP’s behavior of the mentioned type proves to be
of particular importance, e.g. for the problem of the light-shifts’ calculation
e−)0. This is due to the fact that in the
in muonium atom, denoted (µ+
highly accurate experimental measurements of the 1s
2s energy splitting
in this exotic system, which are in progress now, the energies, ω1 and ω2,
of two incident photon beams are supposed to be in the resonance with the
εp (see [6] for
following transitions: 1s + ¯hω1 + ¯hω1 →
more details). Therefore precise calculation of the corresponding light-shifts
of 1s- and 2s-levels would be rather desirable.

In the current letter we present the results of analytical and numeri-
cal calculation of αij
n (ω) together with the corresponding light-shifts in the
ns-states, n = 1, 2, of the muonium atom.
It should be pointed out that
the similar calculation by Beausoleil [7] employing a pure numerical scheme
proves to be incomplete. Besides, in the contrast to the usual technique (i.e.
by means of the Green’s function) the current calculation is carried out in
the fashion of Sternheimer [8] where (exact and analytical) summation over
the intermediate states r in (2) is reduced to solution of a certain diﬀerential
equation. Such an approach, which is applied to the problem under consid-
eration for the ﬁrst time, to our knowledge, seems to be rather instructive.
Apart from its self-contained academic interest, it may also give certain ad-
vantages in treating the higher ns-states (n
4) of the hydrogenic systems,
as well as for exact calculation of the various ω-dependent sums of the form:

In view of the given above argument, the contour γ in (19), is still a free
“parameter”, provided that it is deformable into γ1. Let us show how we can
ﬁx it. In fact, the integrand in Eq.(19) is analytical function in the t-plane
cut along any path with the ends at t =
ν)/(2n), the latter
being its logarithmic branching point and the pole of the nth order at the
same time. Owing to that, we can choose γ to be a curve which starts at
−∞
at the lower edge of the cut, runs along the real axis, encircles the point t0 in
the counterclockwise sense and runs back to
along the upper edge of the
cut (see Figure 1(c)). Such a contour is topologically equivalent to γ1 in the
Figure 1(b). Moreover, after passing along γ the integrand returns back to
its initial value, since it decreases exponentially as t
. Here we have
→ −∞
ν = 0. This restriction will however be
temporary assumed that
released later by means of the analytical continuation in ν. For the contour
γ under consideration the integral (19) can be split into two (independent)
parts: (i ) along two edges of the cut and (ii ) along the circle centered at t0.
The part (i ) is reduced in its turn to the integral of the jump at the cut of
the integrand of Eq.(19). It has the form:

Eqs.(34),(36) prove to be convenient for an analysis of the DP’s behavior
when ω
0, as well as for calculation of the DP’s
imaginary part; Eq.(37) is suitable for numerical calculation of the light-shift
of the 2s-level; Eqs. (35),(38), and (39) deﬁne the matrix elements in terms
of the hypergeometric function [10], 2F1(. . .). In this form they easily admit
analytical continuation in ν.

Eq.(45) is in agreement with the well known result of Gavrila [5], as it should.
Eqs.(45)-(46) are rather inconvenient, however, for numerical calculation of
DP for energies lying above the threshold of the levels, i.e. when param-
eters ν11, ν21 become purely imaginary (cf Eq.(44). Besides, they are also
unsuitable for obtaining various asymptotics of these quantities. As was al-
ready mentioned above, for these purposes the integral forms of the matrix
elements, Eqs.(34),(36),(37), prove to be more convenient. Below we com-
bine various most important results of such calculations (see Appendix for
details).

3 Conclusion

The numbers of Eqs.(59),(60) may serve as a good illustration of the method
employed. They are, however, of independent signiﬁcance. The value of
E21(ω1) is in fair agreement with the result [7]. One has to stress that in
∆
obtaining these energy shifts we used the average intensities. As it shown in
[7], an account for a space-inhomogeneity of a laser ﬁeld may increase each
of these numbers by a factor of 10. It is relevant to point out here that the
results obtained for n = 1, 2 can be extended on the case of arbitrary n. Such
type of calculation can be mostly eﬃciently performed on the basis of Eq.(26)
valid for all n, e.g. with the help of Maple [12], being an easy-to-use computer
algebra program. Hence, in the contrast to a pure numerical scheme (say,

17

in a fashion of Beausoleil [7]), one obtains analytical, rather than numerical,
result which is already well adapted for further numerical calculation (one-
fold integration). Such an integration is performed only at the very last stage
of calculation and usually carried out in no time. Furthermore, by that means
one considerably reduces numerical errors. Beyond that, analytical formulae
admit straightforward computation of the various asimptotics with respect to
all parameters encounted in them. As an example we can mention the result
of Eqs.(55)-(56) when the photon energy, ω, tends to the threshold, Ins, being
of particular importance for the problem under consideration. This argument
may be considered as additional advantage of the method employed. Besides,
as was already mentioned in the Introduction, the formula (26), as well as
its particular cases, Eqs.(30)-(32), enable a straightfoward calculation of the
sums, Eq.(3). In fact, S(µ)

n (ω) can be deﬁned, in analogy with (7), as

4 are taken into consideration.

The analysis, whose details will be given elsewhere, shows that for low n it
can be expressed in a closed form for any µ. The corresponding calculations
prove to be simpler than those where the Green function is employed. We
would interpret this circumstance, thereby, as a self-contained importance of
the current method when it is applied to the problem under consideration.
One would expect that this advantage will even be enhanced if the states

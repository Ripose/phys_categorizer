It is known many examples when the excitation or ionization of atoms occurs as

result of the action of sudden perturbations. First of all these are atomic excitation

or ionization in the nuclear reactions [1,2]. For example in β-decay of nucleus, when

the fast β-electron’s escape is perceived by atomic electrons as a sudden changing of

nuclear charge or in neutron impact with nucleus, when the sudden of momentum

transfer to the nucleus occurs etc. The sudden approximation [3] can be used for

consideration multielectron transition in complex atoms, when transition occurring

in internal shells, are perceived by relatively slow electrons of external shells as

instantaneous (see [4,5]). As a result of action of sudden perturbation can be con-

sidered inelastic processes in the collisions of fast multicharged ions with atoms [6 -

12] and in the collisions of charged particles with highly-excited atoms [13]. After

action of sudden perturbation, the excited atom can relax with radiation of photons

belonging to known spectrum of isolated atom. However, if sudden perturbation

causes the change of velocities of atomic electrons, atom can radiate during the ac-

tion of perturbation. Classical analogue of such a problem is the [14] radiation of a

free electron under the sudden changing of velocity. In many practically important

cases perturbation is not suﬃciently small to use a perturbation theory. However

the situations when the time of action of perturbation is considerably less than the

characteristic atomic time that enables one to solve the problem without restricting

the value of perturbation (see for instance [9,15-17]).

Thus, it is necessary to state a general problem on the spectrum of photons

emitted by atom during the time of action of sudden perturbation, i.e.

- on the

spectrum of photons emitted simultaneously by all atomic electrons as a result of

action of perturbation. In this paper we derive a general expression for the spectrum

of photons emitted by the atom under sudden perturbation and apply this result to

some concrete processes.

Consider ”collision” type sudden perturbation [3], when the perturbation V (t)

≡
(where ra are the coordinates of atomic electrons) acts only during the

V (ra, t)

time τ , which is much smaller than the characteristic period of unperturbed atom,

describing by Hamiltonian H0. To be deﬁnite we will assume that V (t) is not equal

zero near t = 0 only. Then in the exact solution of Schr¨odinger equation ( atomic

units are used throughout in this paper)

one can neglect by evolution of ψ (during the time τ ) caused by unperturbed Hamil-

tonian H0. Therefore the transition amplitude of atom from the initial state ϕ0 to a

i

ﬁnal state ϕn, as a result of actions of sudden perturbation V (t), has the form [3,6]:

where ϕ0 and ϕn belong to the full set of orthonormalized eigenfunctions of the

unperturbated Hamiltonian H0, i.e. H0ϕn = ǫnϕn.

Thus in the sudden perturbation approximation the evolution of the initial state

has the form

where ψ0(t) satisﬁes the equation

ψ0(t) = exp(

V (t′)dt′)ϕ0 ,

Therefore the one photon radiation amplitude can be calculated in the ﬁrst order

of perturbation theory (as a corrections to the states (2) and (4)) over the interaction

of atomic electrons with electromagnetic ﬁeld [18,19]

is the number of atomic electrons, ˆpa are the momentum operators of atomic elec-

trons. Then in the dipole approximation the amplitude of emission of photon with

simultaneous transition of atom from the state ϕ0 to a state ϕn has the form

Thus we have obtained the radiation spectrum of atom during the time of sudden

perturbation V (t).

As an application we consider the radiation spectrum of atom in the sudden
transmission of momentum p to the atomic electrons when V (t) has the (widely

used for collision problems) form

V (t) = f(t)

and f(t) is the perturbing force which not depends on ra and interacts during a time
τ that is considerable less than the characteristic periods of the unperturbed atom.

The total radiation spectrum (6) in this case has the form

where ˜f (ω), is the Fourier transform of the functions f(t), deﬁned according to (7),
Za is the number of atomic electrons.
In this case the spectrum coincides (after

producting to ω) with the radiation spectrum of the classical particle with mass

equal to electron’s one and with charge Za, moving in the ﬁeld of homogeneous
forces f(t). This gives us the information about the value of the spectrum (9). Since

f(t)

= 0 just during the time τ , and the spectrum (9) is proportional to

˜f(ω)

can be emitted by atom.

Analogously one can consider the radiation of atom in the ”switching” type

sudden perturbation (we use the classiﬁcation of sudden perturbations introduced

in [3]).

Formula (5) allows one to obtain the spectrum of photons in the transition of

atom from the state ϕ0 to a state ϕn under the inﬂuence of perturbation (8):

Here dW/dω =

In the most simple case of instantaneous transferring to atomic electrons the

momentum p, when in (8) f(t) = p
δ(t), where δ(t) is the Dirac δ-function, then
˜f (ω) = p and spectrum (9) coincides, after producting to ω, with the radiation
spectrum of free classical particle [14] with charge Za, which takes (suddenly) a
velocity p.

As an another example we give the radiation spectrum in the inﬂuence of pulse

having the Gausian form

One should note an important generality of radiation at sudden perturbation,

namely, the radiation intensity for the multielectron atoms is proportional to the

4

square of the number of atomic electrons. This fact allows one to conclude on the

coherence of radiation of atomic electrons under such type inﬂuences.

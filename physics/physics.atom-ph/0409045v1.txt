We report ﬁrst conﬁguration interaction calculations of hyperﬁne constants Ak and the eﬀective
electric ﬁeld Wd acting on the electric dipole moment of the electron, in two excited electronic
states of 207PbO. The obtained hyperﬁne constants, Ak = −3826 MHz for the a(1) state and
Ak = 4887 MHz for the B(1) state, are in very good agreement with the experimental data, −4113
MHz and 5000 ± 200 MHz, respectively. We ﬁnd Wd = − (cid:0)6.1+1.8
−0.6(cid:1) ·1024 Hz/(e · cm) for a(1), and
Wd = − (8.0 ± 1.6) ·1024 Hz/(e · cm) for B(1). The obtained values are analyzed and compared to
recent relativistic coupled cluster results and a semiempirical estimate of Wd for the a(1) state.

Introduction. The search for the electric dipole mo-
ment (EDM) of the electron, de, remains one of the most
fundamental problems in physics. Up to now only up-
per limits were obtained for |de|; the latest constraint,
|de| < 1.6 · 10−27 e·cm, was obtained in an experiment
on atomic Tl [1]. The search for de in heavy-atom po-
lar molecules was initiated by theoretical investigations
[2, 3] on radicals with one unpaired electron. (The ﬁrst
experimental bound on de using such a system was re-
cently obtained, using YbF [4].) It was since noted that
experiments on the excited a(1) [5] or B(1) [6] states of
PbO, which have two unpaired electrons, may make it
possible to search for de with sensitivity 3-4 orders of
magnitude lower than the current limit. An important
feature of such experiments is that the knowledge of the
eﬀective electric ﬁeld, Wd, seen by an unpaired electron
is required for extracting de from the measurements. Wd
can not be obtained in an experiment; rather, electronic
structure calculations are required for its evaluation. Re-
cently, a semiempirical estimate of Wd for the a(1) state
[7] and ab initio relativistic coupled cluster (RCC) [8]
calculations [9] with the generalized relativistic eﬀective
core potential (GRECP) [10, 11] of Wd for both the a(1)
and B(1) states were performed. The nonvariational one-
center restoration (NOCR) technique [10, 12, 13, 14]
was employed for obtaining proper electronic densities
close to nuclei after GRECP/RCC calculations of heavy-
atom molecules. The semiempirical estimate of Ref. [7],
|Wd| ≥ 12 × 1024 Hz/(e·cm), is three times higher than
the RCC result (see Table I). Calculations performed in
[9] demonstrated the need for a higher level of accounting
for correlation in the valence region for the excited a(1)
and B(1) states. The main problem was that the Fock-
space RCC with single and double excitations (RCC-SD)
version used in [9] was not optimal for accounting for the
nondynamic correlations (see [15] for details of RCC-SD
calculations of the Pb atom), though the potential of
the RCC approach for electronic structure calculations is
very high in prospect [16]. The estimated error bounds

put the actual Wd value between 75% and 150% of the
value calculated by the GRECP/RCC/NOCR method.
The main goal of the present work is to calculate Wd for
the a(1) and B(1) states of PbO with improved accuracy
and reliability. To provide an accuracy check for the cal-
culation of the electronic structure near the Pb nucleus,
the hyperﬁne constants (Ak) are also calculated. For this
purpose in the present work the sodci code [17, 18] for
the spin-orbit direct conﬁguration interaction (CI) calcu-
lation is employed, in which the relativistic (spin-orbit)
scheme [19] and new criteria [19, 20] of the conﬁgura-
tion selection proposed by us earlier are incorporated.
In addition, codes for calculation of a one-electron den-
sity matrix with the CI wavefunction and restored four-
component molecular spinors have been developed. With
these codes the 10-electron GRECP/SODCI/NOCR cal-
culations are performed for Ak and Wd in the a(1) and
B(1) states of PbO with wavefunctions restored in the
Pb core (see [9, 21, 22] for recent two-step calculations).
The expressions for Ak and Wd are given in Refs. [9, 23].
Methods and calculations. The above properties were
calculated in two steps. At the ﬁrst step, a 22-electron

plicitly excluded 1s to 4f electrons is used.
tion, the 5s25p2

5/2 shells of lead and the
1s2 shell of oxygen were frozen (see [10] for details) and
the residual ten electrons were treated explicitly in the
subsequent molecular calculations. The basis set on Pb
(15s16p12d9f )/[5s7p4d2f ] as well as GRECP are the
same as those used in paper [9]. The basis set was op-
timized for calculation of properties determined mainly
by the electronic wave function at the Pb core. The
description of the basis set generation procedure can
be found in Refs. [15, 25]. The correlation-consistent
(10s5p2d1f )/[4s3p2d1f ] basis of Dunning listed in the
molcas 4.1 library [26] was used for oxygen.

used in the CI calculations are obtained by the restricted
active space self consistent ﬁeld (RASSCF) method [26,
27] with the spin-averaged part of the GRECP (AGREP)
[10], i.e. only scalar-relativistic eﬀects are taken into ac-
count in the RASSCF calculation. Because the a(1) state
is of primary interest, molecular orbitals were generated
speciﬁcally for the lowest 3Σ+ state. This set of orbitals
was used for the subsequent CI calculations of both the
a(1) and B(1) states. In the RASSCF method, orbitals
are divided into three active subspaces: RAS1, with a
restricted number of holes allowed; RAS2, where all pos-
sible occupations are included; and RAS3, with an upper
limit on the number of electrons.
In this calculation,
no more than two holes in RAS1 and two electrons in
RAS3 are allowed. Using the C2v point group classiﬁ-
cation scheme, two A1 orbitals in RAS1, six orbitals in
RAS2, (two each in A1, B1, and B2 irreps) and 50 (20 A1,
6 A2, 12 B1, and 12 B2) in RAS3 subspaces are included.
Next the spin-orbit CI approach with the selected
single- and double-excitations from some multiconﬁgu-
rational reference states (“mains”) [28] is employed on
the sets of diﬀerent ΛS many-electron spin- and space-
symmetry adapted basis functions (SAFs). In the sodci
code, the double C2v group, C∗
2v, is used to account for
the spin and space symmetry of the PbO molecule, in-
stead of the more restrictive symmetry group C∗
∞v, which
could in principle be employed. In the C∗
2v classiﬁcation
scheme, the doubly-degenerate a(1) and B(1) states have
the components in the B∗
2 irreducible represen-
tations (irreps). The operators Wd and Ak have nonzero
matrix elements only between the wavefunction compo-
nents from B∗
2 irreps. So, one must know both
these components of the a(1) and B(1) states to calcu-
late Wd and Ak when working in the C∗
2v group. The
SAFs from the 2S+1C2v-irreps (constructed on the ba-
sis of AGREP/RASSCF pseudoorbitals), singlet (1B1),
triplets (3A1, 3A2, 3B2) and quintets (5A1, 5A2, 5B1,
5B2), were included in calculations of the components be-
longing to the B∗
1 irrep and equivalent calculations were
performed for those laying in the B∗
(Alterna-
tively, the components belonging to the B∗
2 irrep can be
constructed by acting on those from the B∗
1 irrep by the
operator of projection of the total electronic momentum
on the molecular axis.) 2517 SAFs were included in the
reference space (“main” conﬁgurations); these had the
largest coeﬃcients in the probing CI calculation. The
single and double excitations from this reference space
produce about 175 millions of SAFs. Only the most im-
portant of these, selected by second-order perturbation
theory for chosen thresholds Ti (see Table I), were in-
cluded in the subsequent CI calculation. About 120 000,
500 000, 1 100 000, and 2 000 000 SAFs were selected for
thresholds (in 10−6 a.u.) T1=0.1, T2=0.01, T3=0.0025
and T4=0.001, correspondingly. Then, the linear T =0
[29] and generalized Davidson (full-CI or FCI) [30] cor-
rections are applied to the calculated properties (in more

details it will be discussed in [31]). The T =0 correc-
tion extrapolates the results of calculations with diﬀer-
ent thresholds Ti to a result of the calculation with all
singly- and doubly-excited SAFs included. The full-CI
correction approximates the eﬀect of all possible exci-
tations of higher level (for a given number of correlated
electrons and ﬁxed basis set). Ref. [19] gives more details
about the features of constructing the reference space and
selection procedure.

Before calculating Ak and Wd, the shapes of the four-
component molecular spinors are restored in the inner
core region after the two-component GRECP calculation
of the molecule. For this purpose the NOCR method [12]
is applied at the second step of the calculation. (See [22]
for the currently used formulation of the NOCR scheme
and [9] for details of restoration of the four-component
molecular spinors near the Pb nucleus).

We designate the 5s, 5p, 5d orbitals of lead and 1s or-
bital of oxygen as the ”outercore”, and the σ1, σ2, σ3,
π1, π2 orbitals of PbO (consisting mainly of 6s, 6p or-
bitals of Pb and 2s, 2p orbitals of O) as valence. In the
CI calculations we take into account only the correlations
between valence electrons. At the ﬁnal stage of our cal-
culation, we estimate the contribution from correlations
of valence electrons with outercore electrons (as well as
for correlations between outercore pairs of electrons) as
diﬀerence in the results of the corresponding 30- and 10-
electron GRECP/RCC calculations. (See also [15] where
this correction is applied to the Pb atom). We will des-
ignate such correlations below in the text and tables as
“outercore correlations”.

Results and discussion. Calculations were performed
at two internuclear distances, R = 3.8 a.u. (as in the
RCC calculations of [9]), and R = 4.0 a.u. The latter
point is closer to the equilibrium distances [32] both for
a(1) (Re = 4.06 a.u.) and for B(1) (Re = 3.914 a.u.).
However, in the RCC calculations [9], R = 3.8 a.u. was
used because of a problem with convergence at R = 4.0
a.u. The calculated values with the one-center expansion
of the molecular spinors in the Pb core on either s, s; p
or s; p; d partial waves are collected in Table I. The ﬁnal
data are obtained as the result of linear extrapolation to
the experimental equilibrium distances.

As was noted in [9] when comparing the RASSCF re-
sults with those obtained by the RCC method, the spin-
orbit interaction changes Ak and Wd dramatically, so
even the sign for Wd is changed. One can see a simi-
lar picture from comparison of the RASSCF and CI data
obtained in the present work. The second point to notice
is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of the results obtained at the
internuclear distances R = 3.8 and R = 4.0 a.u., espe-
cially, for the Wd parameter. It is increasing for the a(1)
state and is decreasing for the B(1) state, by 15% and
30%, respectively. The agreement with the experimental
datum attained in the CI calculation of Ak for the a(1)
state at the point R = 4.0 with the threshold T4=0.001

is 13%. After applying T =0 and FCI corrections and
taking into account the outercore correlations the agree-
ment is improved to the level of 9%. The calculated Ak
value for the B(1) state coincides with the measured da-
tum within the experimental uncertainty of 4%. The
results with the T =0 correction are close to those with
the smallest threshold T4=0.001. To check the reliabil-
ity of the linear T =0 correction [29] for Ak and Wd we
have calculated it for three diﬀerent pairs of thresholds:
T1 and T2, T2 and T3, T3 and T4. For Ak all three pairs
give the same result within 1% of accuracy. As to Wd,
the result with the T =0 correction for the ﬁrst pair dif-
fers from those for the other two pairs by 8% for a(1)
and by 5% for B(1). However, the last two pairs again
give the same result within the accuracy of 1% for both
states. So, we suggest, that the T =0 limit is determined
for our main conﬁgurations with an accuracy of 1% for
both considered properties. Because the reference space
is large enough, we have a small FCI correction. When
taking into account outercore contributions at the point
R = 4.0 a.u. we used the results of the RCC calculation
at the point R = 3.8 a.u. This assumption seems reason-
able for several reasons. First, the core should relax less
than the valence region when R is changed. In addition,
because of the spatial separation between the core and
valence electrons, core-valence correlation contributions
should be more stable than valence-valence ones. Finally,
since these contributions are relatively small, we expect
errors due to this approximation not to be severe.

We next discuss the uncertainty in the calculated Wd
values. (We conﬁne this detailed discussion to the a(1)
state; similar considerations are applied to B(1).) Since
Wd is sensitive to the wavefunction and its derivative at
the Pb nucleus, it is natural to use the value of Ak (which
is also singular close to the Pb nucleus) as a benchmark
for accuracy and stability. Thus, the 10% deviation of
the calculated value of Ak from the experimental value
represents an obvious lower bound for the accuracy of
Wd.
It appears that Wd is less computationally stable
than Ak, however, as may be noted from the variation
in values at various stages of the calculation, shown in
Table I. Thus, this simple argument may underestimate
the error in Wd. Because of the good convergence of the
CI calculation, it appears that the deviation in Ak can
be due in part to sensitivity of the results to the value
of R, and in part to incomplete accounting for outercore-
valence correlations. Consideration of the former eﬀect
leads us to a possible error in Wd of ∼ 10%. The latter is
more diﬃcult to account for numerically, but (based on
experience from similar calculations on HgF, PbF, YbF,
and BaF [14, 21, 33, 34]) we believe that the apparent
insensitivity of Ak to outercore-valence correlations (com-
pared to the case for Wd) is an artifact unlikely to per-
sist in more advanced calculations. Finally, we note that
every improvement to the calculation (increasing corre-
lation threshold; inclusion of core-valence correlation; in-

3

creasing value of R towards the equilibrium value) actu-
ally increases |Wd|. Thus, the true value of |Wd| is not
likely to be much lower than the present calculated value.
The linear extrapolation of the calculated Ak and Wd to
the experimental equilibrium distance for a(1), Re = 4.06
a.u. [35], gives us 3826 MHz and −6.1·1024Hz/(e · cm),
respectively, and the deviation of the extrapolated Ak
value from the experiment now is only 7%. Account-
ing for the above arguments, the estimated error bounds
put the actual Wd value between 90% and 130% of our
ﬁnal value. We obtain Wd for B(1) by linear interpola-
tion of the data obtained at R = 3.8 and 4.0 a.u. to the
experimental equilibrium distance, Re = 3.914 a.u. [32],
yielding Wd = −8.0·1024Hz/(e · cm), with an estimated
error range of ±20 %. Similar interpolation for Ak on
B(1) gives 4887 MHz, which is within the uncertainty of
the current experimental value [36], 5000 ± 200MHz.

Abstract

Calculations of the positron-Li system were performed using the Stochastic

Variational Method and yielded a minimum energy of −7.53208 Hartree for

the L = 0 ground state. Unlike previous calculations of this system, the

system was found to be stable against dissociation into the Ps + Li+ channel

with a binding energy of 0.00217 Hartree and is therefore electronically stable.

This is the ﬁrst instance of a rigorous calculation predicting that it is possible

to combine a positron with a neutral atom and form an electronically stable

bound state.

One of the most tantalizing questions of positron physics is whether it is possible for a

positron to bind itself to a neutral atom and form an electronically stable state [1,2]. This is

a question which can only be answered by a sophisticated calculation (or experimentation)

as the mechanisms responsible for binding the positron to the atom are polarization poten-

tials present in the positron-atom complex. The accurate computation of the polarization

potential for a positron–atom (or electron–atom) system is of course a challenging exercise

in many body physics.

While the question of whether it is possible to bind a positron to a neutral atom is an

open question, the ability of positronium to attach itself to atoms has been known for a long

time. A number of previous works have demonstrated that the positronium–hydride (PsH)

species [3–8] is stable against dissociation into the Ps + H or the e+ + H− channels. In this

case, binding is more likely since the positron is binding itself to a species with an overall

negative charge.

The question of whether a positron can form an electronically stable bound state with

a neutral atom is more vexing. Dzuba et al [9] have made calculations suggesting that it is

possible to bind a positron to atomic species with two valence electrons such as Mg, Zn, Cd

and Hg. These calculations were performed in the framework of many–body perturbation

theory and their results, while suggestive, cannot be regarded as providing proof to the

existence to electronically stable positronic atoms.

In their work, Dzuba et al [9] did not consider the possibility of positrons forming bound

states with alkali atoms such as Li, Na, K, ... even though the polarization potential for

these species should be stronger than for the alkaline and alkaline earth atoms and therefore

the possibility of binding should be improved. One diﬃculty in binding positrons to alkali

atoms is that the ionization energy of the alkali atoms is smaller than the binding energy of

positronium. Therefore the binding energy of the positron to the neutral atom must exceed

a particular value for the species to be stable against dissociation into positronium + ion.

For example, for the Li–e+ species to be stable against dissociation into positronium plus

Li+ requires that the binding energy of the e+ with respect to the Li ground state be greater

2

than (0.25−0.19815) Hartree. In this respect, it is more appropriate to regard the possibility

of binding as a question of whether Ps can itself bind to Li+.

Previous works [5,10] on this species had shown that while the Li–e+ system can have a

total energy lower than neutral Li, the energy was not low enough to prevent dissociation

into Ps + Li+. In this work, a large variational calculation of the Li–e+ system is performed

using the Stochastic Variational Method of Varga and Suzuki [11]. In contradiction with

previous works it is found that the ground state is electronically stable and the binding

energy for this state is calculated.

A Gaussian basis has long been a popular tool for variational calculations in various

areas of quantum physics and chemistry. The Gaussian basis used in this work has two very

important features that make it possible to generate very accurate wave functions for few

body systems. First, the matrix elements of the interaction Hamiltonian can be calculated

analytically or, at worst, reduced to a one-dimensional integral for any number of particles.

Second, that part of the wave function concerned with the spatial coordinates maintains

its functional form after any possible permutation of the particles. This is a very useful

property for studying systems containing identical particles.

The Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) was initially proposed as a method suitable

for solving nuclear structure problems involving a small number of particles [12,13]. The

main idea behind the method is to use stochastic techniques to optimize the non-linear

parameters (i.e. the exponents) of the underlying Gaussian basis. Since the Gaussian basis

contains terms with r2

ij correlation factors, the method is capable of achieving results of the

highest accuracy provided the non-linear parameters are properly optimized.

In recent years, the SVM and related methods have been used by many groups to perform

high precision variational calculations in atomic, mesoatomic, hypernuclear and multiquark

systems [7,14–16]. Recently, the SVM has been modiﬁed to allow the calculation of excited

states and also to permit the use of a wide variety of non-central forces [17,18]. In this work,

the program of Varga and Suzuki [11] (which can be used with arbitrary pairwise central

forces) was used for the calculations. A detailed description of the method and the results

3

of test calculations on various atomic and nuclear system containing 3–6 particles can be

found in [11,17].

An initial series of calculations on a variety of related species were performed to esti-

mate the uncertainties in the present calculation and validate the method. Results of our

calculations for neutral Li, neutral Be, and the PsH species are shown in Table I and com-

pared with other accurate nonrelativistic calculations. We show results that were computed

with an inﬁnite nuclear mass to simplify comparison with the other results in Table I. Our

calculation for PsH, agreed with the best previous calculation to within 4×10−6 Hartree [7].

Results for the more complicated Be and Li− species underestimate the best calculations

[20] by less than 7.0 × 10−4 Hartree.

Since the question of whether an electronically stable bound state exists depends on the

energy relative to the sum of the energies for the Li+ and Ps atoms, the energy of the Li+

ground state was computed. Our result is identical with that of the classic calculation of

Pekeris [22] to 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures and indicates that binding will occur if the total energy

of the Li-e+ system is lower than -7.529913 Hartree.

The convergence of energy of the Li–e+ system as a function of the number of gaussoid

basis functions is shown in the Table II.

It is noticeable that a very large calculation,

including at least 300 gaussoid basis functions, was needed before deﬁnite evidence of a bound

state was obtained. The largest calculation included 800 basis functions, and resulted in a

total energy of E = −7.53208 Hartree which is equivalent to a binding energy of ε = 0.00217

Hartree. When reference is made to the binding energy of the Li–e+ system it should be

noted that the binding energy is relative to breakup into Li+ and Ps.

Energy expectation values were also computed with the present optimized wave functions

for a ﬁnite mass. The 7Li nucleus has a mass of M = 12863.2me and for this species we

obtained E(300) = −7.279325 Hartree for Li+, and E(800) = −7.531491 Hartree for Li–e+

giving a binding energy of ε = 0.00217 Hartree. For most purposes, ﬁnite mass eﬀects can

be ignored since they will not change the binding energy by more than 1%.

The statement that a bound state exists also remains valid when relativistic eﬀects are

4

taken into consideration. One estimate of the relativistic energy correction for neutral Li is

0.000011 Hartree [21]. An energy correction of this size cannot aﬀect the primary conclusion,

namely the existence of an Li–e+ bound state, but might have to be taken into consideration

if a really precise value of the binding energy is to be achieved. Nevertheless, we are conﬁdent

in asserting that the Li–e+ ground state is electronically stable against decay into both the

Li–e+ and Li+–Ps channels.

While the state is electronically stable, it is not stable against electron-positron annihi-

lation. The dominant decay process for electron-positron annihilation is into two γ–rays.

Therefore the two-photon annihilation rate Γ2γ was computed using the general formula,

Γ2γ = πnα4ca−1

0 < δ−+ > ≈ 50.30874045 × 109 n < δ−+ > sec−1,

(1)

which is valid for a system containing n electrons and one positron [7]. In the above expres-

sion, δ−+ is the expectation value of electon-positron Dirac δ function

< δ−+ >=

< Ψ|δ(re− − re+)|Ψ >
< Ψ|Ψ >

(2)

The annihilation rate for the Li–e+ system was Γ2γ = 1.70 ×109 sec−1. The annihilation rate

for PsH has been computed as a consistency check and the value we obtain, Γ2γ = 2.45 ×

109 sec−1, is consistent with the best previous estimate [7], namely Γ2γ = 2.436 × 109 sec−1.

Other recent studies of the positron–Li system [5,10] had shown that an electronically

stable bound state did not exist. The failure to ﬁnd a bound state can be attributed to the

diﬃculty in performing a calculation on a system containing 4 active particles that had to be

accurate to 10−3 Hartree. The most recent study [10] of the Li–e+ system used the Diﬀusion

quantum Monte Carlo method to predict an energy of −7.5203 ± 0.0048 Hartree which only

just failed to indicate a stable bound state. This calculation, correctly predicted the binding

energy of the e+–H− system (−0.7891 ± 0.0020 Hartree) but evidently the calculation of

Li–e+ system is more exacting.

The conﬁguration-interaction-Hylleraas calculation (CI-Hy) of Li–e+ system by Clary [5]

was performed by adapting a method that had previously been very successful for atoms

5

[23] and gave an energy of −7.5094 Hartree. As a similar calculation by Clary [5] of the

PsH system underestimated the energy by 0.0050 Hartree it is not unexpected that it failed

to predict a stable Li–e+ system. Given that the CI-Hy method [23] gave an energy for

neutral Be (-14.6665 Hartree) which agrees with the best current estimate to within 0.0008

Hartree it is interesting to speculate on the reason for the slower convergence of the method

for systems containing a positron. The resolution of this puzzle probably lies in the fact

that the correlations between an electron and a positron are distinctly diﬀerent than the

correlations between two electrons. A system involving purely electrons has two implicit

features that will act to diminish the importance of inter-electronic correlations. First of all,

the Pauli principle acts to keep electrons with the same spin away from each other. Second,

the electron-electron interaction also acts to keep electrons away from each other. However,

neither of these eﬀects is present if an electron is replaced by a positron. The interaction

between an electron and a positron is attractive, and it easy to imagine a system with one

valence electron like lithium evolving into a conﬁguration consisting of a positronium atom

orbiting around a positively charged (1s)2 core.

This possibility was investigated by projecting the Li–e+ ground state wave function

onto a wave function containing the product of the ground state positronium wave function

and the two electron wave function for Li+. The normalization of the residual part of the

projected wave function (essentially the wave function for the Ps center of mass) was found

to be 0.93. Therefore, the best heuristic model of the Li–e+ ground state would be to regard

the system as a positronium atom weakly attached to, and orbiting around a Li+ (1s)2 core.

The present calculation represents the ﬁrst rigorous calculation giving positive evidence

that it is possible to combine a positron with a neutral atom and form an electronically

stable system. Although, the best ab-initio estimate of the binding energy, 0.00217 Hartree

is subject to uncertainties due to incomplete convergence of the Li–e+ energy, the state-

ment that the system is electronically stable will certainly remain valid under any possible

reﬁnements of the model.

Having shown that it is possible to combine a positron with neutral Li to form an

6

electronically stable bound state, an immediate question arises as to whether it is possible

to join a positron to a more complicated alkali atom such as sodium and also form a bound

state. The answer to this question cannot be obtained with a calculation identical to the

present calculation, rather the present method would have to be reﬁned to incorporate the

physics of a closed shell core. The possible existence of additional positronic atoms is a topic

that is worth further investigation.

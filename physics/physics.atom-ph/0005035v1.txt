We report on cooling of an atomic cesium gas closely above an evanescent-wave atom mirror. At
high densitities, optical cooling based on inelastic reﬂections is found to be limited by a density-
dependent excess temperature and trap loss due to ultracold collisions involving repulsive molecular
states. Nevertheless, very good starting conditions for subsequent evaporative cooling are obtained.
Our ﬁrst evaporation experiments show a temperature reduction from 10 µK down to 300 nK along
with a gain in phase-space density of almost two orders of magnitude.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Optical dipole traps based on far-detuned laser light
have become very popular as versatile tools for the stor-
age of ultracold atomic gases and can be employed for
a great variety of experiments, e.g., on quantum phe-
nomena, precision measurements, ultracold collisions and
quantum gases [1]. Optical dipole traps have opened up
fascinating new experimental possibilities not oﬀered by
other trapping methods.

A very important advantage compared with magnetic
traps is the fact that a dipole trap can store atoms in
any sub-state or mixtures of sub-states of the electronic
ground state. Because of the unusual scattering prop-
erties of cesium the use of an optical dipole trap may
be the only way to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation
of this interesting atomic species. For Cs the quantum-
mechanical scattering is resonantly enhanced [2, 3], and
binary collisions ﬂipping the spin state lead to severe loss
from magnetic traps [4, 5, 6, 7]. The latter eﬀect, which
has been explained by resonant scattering in combination
with a second-order spin-orbit coupling [8, 9], has so far
prevented the attainment of a quantum-degenerate gas
of cesium atoms.

Inelastic two-body collisions are energetically sup-
pressed in the absolute internal ground state of cesium,
which is the high-ﬁeld seeking state F = 3, mF = 3.
Atoms in this state cannot be trapped magnetically but
in an optical trap.
In recent experiments, Vuletic et
al. have discovered a low-ﬁeld Feshbach resonance [10],
which promises an easy experimental way to tune the s-
wave scattering length in a wide range. With magnetic
ﬁelds between 17 G and 30 G a positive scattering length
should allow for a stable Bose-Einstein condensate.

In our experiments to explore the quantum gas prop-

erties of cesium, we use the gravito-optical surface trap
(GOST) [11]. This optical dipole trap allows one to con-
ﬁne a large sample of atoms in an almost conservative
environment with very eﬃcient precooling by a Sisyphus-
type mechanism. In a second stage, evaporative cooling is
implemented to further increase the atomic phase-space
density.
In this article, we summarize the basic prop-
erties of the GOST (Sec. II) and discuss the limitations
of optical cooling at high densities (Sec. III). We then
report our ﬁrst evaporative cooling results (Sec. IV) and
discuss the prospects of future experiments (Sec. V).

II. GRAVITO-OPTICAL SURFACE TRAP

A. Trapping potential and general properties

A schematic overview of the geometry of the trap is
given in ﬁgure 1. The GOST is an “optical mug”, whose
bottom consists of an evanescent-wave (EW) atom mirror
generated by total internal reﬂection of a blue-detuned
laser beam from the surface of a prism, while the walls
are formed by an intense hollow beam (HB) which passes
vertically through the prism surface.

The steep exponential decay of the EW intensity along
the vertical direction and the sharp focussing of the hol-
low beam lead to large intensity gradients and thus in
combination with the blue detuning of both light ﬁelds
to a strong repulsive dipole force. We exploit this fact
to eﬃciently keep the atoms in the dark inner region of
the trap where the unwanted eﬀect of heating through
scattering of trapping light photons is suppressed. In ad-
dition to that, the concept also features a large trapping
volume which allows for a transfer of a large number of
atoms into the GOST. Due to the accurate focussing of
the hollow laser beam into a ring-shaped intensity pro-
ﬁle [12], the shape of the potential is box-like along the
horizontal directions whereas the combination of gravity
and the repulsive wall of the EW leads to a wedge-shaped
potential vertically.

In thermal equilibrium this geometry allows for a sim-
ple description of the ensemble. The vertical density pro-

n(z) = n0 exp(−z/z0)

with n0 being the peak number density and z0 =
kBT /mg the 1/e-height of the sample. m denotes the
mass of the cesium atom, g the gravitational accelera-
tion, z the vertical coordinate and T the temperature.
Assuming a homogeneous horizontal density distribution
within the hollow beam radius rHB this expression can
be integrated to express the peak density n0 in terms of
the atom number N and the temperature T ,

The mean density ¯n deﬁned as

(3)

is exactly half of the peak density (¯n = n0/2). In the
GOST potential the scaling of density with temperature
(n ∝ T −1) is somewhat less as compared to a 3D har-
monic oscillator where n ∝ T −3/2.
The mean energy per atom is ¯E = 5/2 kBT , of which
3/2 kBT are kinetic energy and one kBT potential energy
in the vertical gravitational ﬁeld, as can be obtained us-
ing the Virial theorem. In the horizontal degree of free-
dom the box form of the conﬁning potential leads to neg-
ligible potential energy.

While the horizontal extension of the sample is deter-
mined by the diameter of the hollow beam (2 rHB), the
height is proportional to the ensemble temperature with
a constant of proportionality of 6.4 µm/µK. At typical
equilibrium temperatures of a few µK the 1/e-height is
on the order of a few ten µm thus leading to a highly
anisotropic “pancake-shape” of the ensemble.

B. Experimental realization

The experimental constituents of the GOST are the
evanescent-wave diode laser, a titanium:sapphire laser to
create the hollow beam and an additional diode laser to
provide the light for the repumping beam. For EW and
repumping beam we use laser diodes (SDL-5712-H1, dis-
tributed Bragg reﬂector), which yield up to 100 mW of ra-
diation at the cesium D2-line at a wavelength of 852 nm.
The EW laser is focussed to provide a round spot on
the surface of the prism with a 1/e2-radius of 540 µm.
The angle of incidence is θ = 45.6◦ which is 2◦ above
the critical angle of 43.6◦. This leads to a 1/e2 decay
length of Λ = (λ/2π)(n2 sin2 θ − 1)−1/2 ≈ 500 nm, where
n = 1.45 is the refractive index of the fused-silica prism.
The EW detuning δEW is between a few GHz during
optical Sisyphus cooling and up to 300 GHz in the process
of evaporative cooling. Since atoms are predominantly
kept in the lower hyperﬁne ground state (F =3) in the
dipole trap, all detunings given throughout this paper
refer to the transition between this state and the center
of the 2P3/2 excited-state manifold.

At δEW /2π = 3 GHz and a power of 45 mW the EW
creates a repulsive optical potential with a height of
∼ 1 mK. The potential barrier is reduced by typically a
factor of two by the attractive van-der-Waals interaction
between the atoms and the dielectric surface [13].

The hollow beam is generated using an axicon optics
[12] to create a ring-shaped focus of an inner and outer
1/e-radius of rHB = 260 µm and rHB + ∆rHB = 290 µm,
respectively. It has a power of 350 mW and its detuning
is in the range between −0.3 nm and −2 nm. The HB
provides a potential barrier on the order of 100 µK height.
At this detuning the HB potential is almost conservative
as the photon scattering rates can be estimated to be on
the order of a few photons up to a few ten photons per
second.

The repumping beam needed for the optical Sisyphus
cooling [14] is resonant with the F = 4 → F ′ = 4 hyper-
ﬁne transition of the D2-line and has an intensity on the
order of 1 µW/cm2. It is shone on the trapping region
from above (see ﬁg. 1).

C. Loading of the trap

The loading scheme of the GOST goes along standard
ways starting from an eﬀusive atomic beam which is de-
celerated by a Zeeman slower [15]. A magneto-optical
trap (MOT) collects about 3 × 108 atoms under ultra-
high vacuum conditions (∼10−11 mbar). The sample is
then cooled to ∼ 10 µK and spatially compressed using a
polarization gradient cooling scheme, in which the MOT
laser detuning is increased within 50 ms from 3 Γ to 14 Γ;
here Γ/2π = 5.3 MHz denotes the natural linewidth. Af-
ter the atomic cloud is shifted from its loading position
(3 mm above the surface) to a release position (0.5 mm)
close to the evanescent wave using magnetic oﬀset ﬁelds,

the MOT-laser beams are shuttered and the atoms fall
onto the EW-light sheet. As soon as the near-resonant
light ﬁelds of the MOT are switched oﬀ, the repumping
beam of the GOST is turned on to optically pump the
atoms into the lower hyperﬁne state (F =3), and the Sisy-
phus cooling in the GOST starts. Initially up to 2 × 107
atoms are transfered into the dipole trap and undergo
optical cooling.

The number of atoms N remaining in the GOST after
a variable storage time is measured by recapturing them
into the MOT and taking a ﬂuorescence picture using
a slow-scan CCD camera. The integrated ﬂuorescence
signal, calibrated with a more accurate absorption image
of the MOT, allows us to determine N with an estimated
uncertainty of less than 50%.

III. OPTICAL COOLING AT HIGH DENSITIES

Here we discuss the eﬃcient EW Sisyphus cooling
mechanism and its role as optical precooling stage for
evaporative cooling in the GOST. We present our obser-
vations of density-dependent eﬀects that limit EW cool-
ing, namely an excess temperature and trap loss due to
ultracold collisions in the presence of blue-detuned light.

A. Evanescent-wave Sisyphus cooling

The optical cooling process is based on inelastic reﬂec-
tions of the repeatedly bouncing cesium atoms from the
evanescent wave [14, 16].
In the great majority of the
bounces the atoms are coherently reﬂected in the lower
hyperﬁne state (F =3) without any dissipation of kinetic
energy or heating. However, occasionally the absorption
of an EW photon takes place and the subsequent spon-
taneous decay will either have the atom end up in the
F =3- or the F =4 hyperﬁne state. A decay into the up-
per hyperﬁne state occurs with a branching ratio of q =
0.25 and due to the reduced dipole force on this state
will lead to a weaker repulsion of the atom from the EW
and thereby to a damping of the vertical motion. Af-
ter leaving the EW the atom is optically pumped back
into the lower hyperﬁne state. Simple considerations on
the balance of cooling through this process and heating
due to photon scattering lead to an expression for the
equilibrium temperature:

T = (cid:18) 1

qr(cid:19) (cid:18)1 +

(4)

The ﬁrst term in brackets represents the average number
of photons scattered per cooling reﬂection. qr = 5/12
denotes the branching ratio of the decay of the F ’=4
excited state into the F =3 ground state.
δEW is the
detuning of the evanescent wave and δHFS = 2π×9.2 GHz
the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state. Trec = 200 nK
is the recoil temperature of cesium. The experimental
parameters yield a cooling limit of slightly less than 2 µK.

FIG. 2: Measurement of the equilibrium temperature for
2.5 × 104 trapped atoms at a large HB detuning of 2 nm. The
employed release-and-recapture method allows to determine
the horizontal and vertical temperatures Th and Tv separately.
This is accomplished by switching oﬀ either the EW or the
HB for a short time interval ∆tEW or ∆tEW , respectively,
and measuring the corresponding loss of atoms. Under equi-
librium conditions the sample has an isotropic temperature,
which in this case (T = 2.0 µK) is very close to the theoretical
cooling limit of EW Sisyphus cooling.

These considerations are consistent with observed tem-

peratures of 2.0 µK in small samples (N <
∼ 105 atoms) at
large hollow beam detunings (see ﬁgure 2). Dense sam-
ples with N ≫ 105 atoms show an excess temperature as
will be discussed in the following section.
The time scale on which the cooling process takes place
is on the order of one second – considerably longer than
in a MOT. Theoretical considerations on the cooling dy-
namics [14] predict an exponential drop of the vertical
temperature in the beginning of the cooling process with
a rate constant

At δEW = 2π × 3 GHz we ﬁnd β = 1.1 s−1.
Cooling of the horizontal motion is facilitated through
mixing of the vertical and the horizontal degrees of free-
dom by either diﬀuse reﬂection of atoms from the EW
[11, 17] or in the case of dense samples by elastic colli-
sions. Right after the transfer from the MOT into the
GOST, the potential energy from the fall is gradually
converted into thermal energy and leads to a very hot
(∼ 100 µK) sample after thermalization within ∼ 0.5 s.
The few seconds it takes for the ensemble to reach the
equilibrium temperature are consistent with the calcu-
lated cooling rate.

To measure temperatures we use a release-and-
recapture method which is accomplished by turning oﬀ
the EW-potential for a short duration (few milliseconds)
and measuring the remaining fraction of atoms as a func-
tion of this release time. A ﬁt of a theoretical model
to the data which is based on a Boltzmann distribution
[15], yields T as the only ﬁt parameter. Under the con-
ditions of the experiments reported here the sample is
almost thermalized at any time, so that separate mea-

In a new experimental setup, in which the HB optics
was substantially improved to provide aberration-free fo-
cussing [19], we are now able to trap 107 atoms at a HB
detuning of 1 nm and achieve a temperature of ∼ 10 µK.
This is better by a roughly a factor of two as compared
to the conditions of the reported experiments. The im-
proved setup was used for the evaporation experiments
in Sec. IV.

surements of the horizontal temperature were not rou-
tinely performed.

B. Excess temperature in dense samples

Measurements of T in large atomic samples yield signif-
icantly higher temperatures (∼10 µK) compared to what
we found in earlier experiments on small samples [11].
It turns out that the equilibrium temperature of EW
Sisyphus cooling depends critically on the number of
trapped atoms. Figure 3 shows the strong dependence
of T on atom number for typical operating conditions of
the GOST. The data is reasonably described by a linear
dependence

T = T0 + aN ,

(6)

where T0 = 4.5 µK is the limit temperature achieved in
small samples and a = 1.5 µK/(106 atoms) the slope. The
limit temperature T0 can be reduced close to the EW
Sisyphus cooling limit (see eq. 4) by increasing the de-
tuning of the hollow beam (see ﬁgure 2), which is easily
explained by heating due to photon scattering. However
at large detunings it is not possible to transfer large num-
bers of atoms into the GOST so that one has to ﬁnd a
compromise between appreciable atom number and low
temperature.

The excess temperature as observed in large sam-
ples indicates the presence of multiple photon scattering.
Similar observations are made in experiments on “gray
molasses” where one also keeps the atoms predominantly
in the F = 3 ground state [18]. We ﬁnd that the slope
a decreases with increasing HB detuning. It is however
not obvious that this excess heating solely depends on
the hollow beam. The repumping beam of EW Sisyphus
cooling is likely to contribute to this eﬀect.

C. Binary collisions in a blue-detuned light ﬁeld

Lifetimes of samples of more than 106 atoms were
found to be on the order of 5 to 10 seconds and clearly
indicated the presence of a strong nonexponential con-
tribution to the decay (see ﬁgure III C). We model the
decay assuming the presence of a two-body loss process
in the standard loss rate equation [20]
˙N = −αN − β ¯nN .

(7)

To solve this equation one has to consider the complete
dependence of the mean density ¯n on the atom number
N , which is also inﬂuenced by the observed excess tem-
perature. Since cooling and thermalization takes place
on a time scale much shorter than the decay one can as-
sume stationary conditions for T (N ) according to eq. 6.
Using this and equation 2 one obtains

.

(8)

Solving the diﬀerential equation one can almost perfectly
ﬁt the experimental data and extract the quadratic loss
coeﬃcient β as a ﬁt parameter. Figure III C demon-
strates the good agreement between the model and
the measurement. We ﬁnd β to be on the order of
10−12 cm3/s, which is about an order of magnitude less
as compared to radiative escape in a MOT [20].

A possible mechanism for the observed loss is based
on the excitation of a pair of colliding cesium atoms into
a repulsive molecular state [21, 22, 23, 24]. The reso-
nant dipole-dipole interaction splits the excited molecu-
lar state into an attractive and a repulsive branch. While
the attractive branch gives rise to loss processes like ra-
diative escape and photoassociation in red-detuned light,
the repulsive branch becomes relevant in blue-detuned
light. When a cesium pair is excited into a repulsive
molecular state at the classical Condon point it is accel-
erated along the potential curve and obtains a kinetic en-
ergy equivalent to the detuning of the exciting light ﬁeld
with respect to the atomic transition. For a dipole trap
the resulting energy gain is in general much larger than
the trap depth and leads to an ejection of both colliding
atoms from the trap. According to a simple semi-classical
model the corresponding rate coeﬃcient β should scale
with the laser detuning and intensity as I/δ2 as long as
the intensity is low enough to avoid optical shielding ef-
fects [21].

FIG. 4: Decay of the number of trapped atoms with increasing
storage time under the same experimental conditions as in
ﬁg. 3. The measured data points (dots) are well ﬁtted by a
theoretical model that takes into account loss due to binary
collisions. The ﬁt (solid line) yields α = 0.03 s−1 and β =
0.9 × 10−12 cm3/s for the rate coeﬃcients.

FIG. 5: Rate coeﬃcient βcat describing the loss induced by an
additional, blue-detuned “catalysis” laser. The experimental
data are taken for three diﬀerent intensities and, in order to
check the expected proportionality to I/δ2, are scaled to the
lowest intensity I0 = 2 mW/cm2. The resulting 1/δ2-behavior
is indicated by the solid ﬁt curve. The deviations of some
data around 20 GHz is likely due to drifts of the experimental
conditions.

In a ﬁrst set of measurements to investigate this loss
process we obtained decay curves at diﬀerent detun-
ings of the EW-laser ﬁeld and extracted the rate coef-
ﬁcient β. In a gravito-optical trap the mean EW dipole
potential experienced by the bouncing atoms is given
by ¯Udip = mgΛ/2,
independent of intensity and de-
tuning. Therefore the mean intensity ¯I to which an
atom is exposed is proportional to the detuning δEW .
Thus the expected scaling of the rate coeﬃcient is β ∝
¯I/δ2
EW ∝ 1/δEW . Measurements in the detuning range
between 1 GHz and 7 GHz [25] indeed showed the ex-
pected 1/δEW -behaviour. This conﬁrms that collisions
in the evanescent wave can explain the observed loss.

As a practical consequence of this fact we can minimize
trap loss during optical cooling by switching the EW de-
tuning to higher values shortly after loading. Only in the
initial cooling phase low detuning is required to provide
a suﬃciently large potential barrier. Therefore, in exper-
iments aiming at high densities, the detuning is routinely
switched from 3 GHz to about 7 GHz after 0.5 s.

To prove that excitation into repulsive molecular states
leads to trap loss we use an additional blue-detuned
“catalysis” laser to induce collisional trap loss. In this
way this process can be studied independently of the pa-
rameters of the trapping potential. The rate coeﬃcient
βcat was measured for diﬀerent values of detuning and in-
tensity of the catalysis laser. In additional temperature
measurements we ensured that heating due to photon
scattering from the catalysis laser was negligible for all
combinations of intensity and detuning. Data was col-
lected at diﬀerent catalysis laser intensities. The results
for βcat shown in ﬁgure 5 agree with the expected scaling
behaviour I/δ2.

As an important conclusion of these results, trap loss
by binary collisions involving repulsive excited molecular

states plays a signiﬁcant role in optical cooling. Never-
theless, a dense sample of many atoms at high densities
can prepared. If the evanescent wave is then operated at
very large detunings, a conservative trapping potential is
obtained with very low photon scattering and strongly
suppressed trap loss, i.e. a very good starting point for
evaporative cooling.

IV. EVAPORATIVE COOLING

The GOST oﬀers favorable conditions to implement
forced evaporative cooling [26] with the prospect to at-
tain quantum-degeneracy of cesium or a two-dimensional
quantum gas.
In contrast to red-detuned dipole traps
used for evaporation experiments [27, 28], the spatial
compression of the cold sample essentially results from
gravity and is thus not aﬀected when the optical poten-
tials are ramped down. Moreover, many more atoms are
initially loaded into the GOST as compared to typical
red-detuned traps. Here we describe our ﬁrst experi-
ments demonstrating the feasibility of eﬃcient evapora-
tion in the GOST.

In our evaporation experiments we operate the trap
at a HB detuning of −1 nm and keep the EW param-
eters as in the measurements described above.
In two
seconds of optical cooling we prepare N = 107 atoms at
a temperature of T = 10 µK, and a peak density of n0 =
6 × 1011 cm−3. For the unpolarized sample in the seven-
fold degenerate F = 3 ground state this corresponds to
dB/7 ≈ 10−5
a peak phase-space density of D = n0λ3
where λdB = h/√2πmkBT is the thermal de-Broglie
wavelength. Elastic collisions take place at a rate on

FIG. 6: Evaporative cooling in the GOST. The detuning ramp
of the EW starts after two seconds of optical cooling and
ends 4.5 s later, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines. The
evolution of the number N and the temperature T of the
trapped atoms is shown in (a), the corresponding behavior of
peak density n0 ∝ N/T and phase-space density D ∝ N/T 5/2
is displayed in (b).

the order of 50 s−1 and, considering the resonant scatter-
ing of cesium [2], lead to a thermalization time of about
200 ms.

To implement forced evaporation we lower the EW po-
tential by ramping up the EW detuning. This simultane-
ously reduces heating due to photon scattering and sup-
presses loss through the collision mechanism described
above. Within 4.5 seconds the EW detuning is increased
exponentially from initially 7 GHz up to 250 GHz. This is
accomplished by rapid mode-hop free temperature tun-
ing of the EW diode laser. In the last 2.5 seconds of the
evaporation ramp the intensity of the hollow beam is re-
duced from 350 mW to 11 mW in order to reduce possible
heating by residual light in the dark center of the hollow
beam. The contribution of the HB potential ramp to the
evaporation remains very small.

The experimental results are shown in ﬁgure 6. About
1 s after starting the exponential ramp, the temperature
begins to drop [ﬁlled squares in (a)]. At the end of the
ramp, it has reached T ≈ 300 nK. This decrease of T by
about 1.5 orders of magnitude is accompanied by a de-
crease of the particle number N [open triangles in (a)]
from 107 down to ∼3×104, i.e. about 2.5 orders of mag-

nitude.

Although the number density n0 ∝ N/T [open cir-
cles in (b)] decreases by about one order of magnitude,
the phase-space density D ∝ n0T −3/2 ∝ N T −5/2 [ﬁlled
squares in (b)] shows a substantial increase by 1.5 or-
ders of magnitude. At the end of the ramp, we obtain a
phase-space density of ∼3 × 10−4.
[3]), the relevant cross section scales ∝ T −1.
In the
GOST potential, this leads to a scaling of the elastic scat-
tering rate and the thermal relaxation rate ∝ N T −3/2.
Therefore the elastic scattering rate is almost constant
for the conditions of our experiments. However, no run-
away regime is reached.

In the regime of resonant elastic scattering (T >

∼ 1 µK

An obvious problem in our evaporation scheme is that,
for the applied exponential ramp, it takes about one sec-
ond until the EW potential barrier becomes low enough
to start the evaporation. Up to this point already about
50% of the particles are lost, presumably by the colli-
sional mechanism investigated in Sec. III C. After the
corresponding initial loss of phase-space density the later
evaporation then leads to a gain of almost two orders of
magnitude. This clearly shows that the potential of evap-
orative cooling in the GOST is much larger than we could
demonstrate in our ﬁrst experiments discussed here.

Although the reported evaporation results are still
quite preliminary they already show that eﬃcient evap-
oration is attainable in the GOST by ramping down the
optical trapping potential. Substantial improvements
can be expected by an optimized evaporation ramp of
the EW in combination with a simultaneous evaporation
through the hollow-beam potential.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have investigated optical and evaporative cooling in
the gravito-optical surface trap. At high densities, optical
cooling by inelastic reﬂections from the evanescent-wave
bottom of the trap was found to be limited by an excess
temperature, which we interpret as a result of multiple
photon scattering. In addition, a loss process is induced
by the blue-detuned trap light. Colliding atoms are ex-
cited into a repulsive molecular state which is followed by
an energy release into the relative motion. Nevertheless,
very good starting conditions are obtained for evapora-
tive cooling. By reducing the trapping potentials we have
cooled the sample down to a temperature of 300 nK and
obtained a phase-space of 3 × 10−4.
So far all our evaporation experiments have been per-
formed with unpolarized atoms in the seven-fold degen-
erate F = 3 ground state. Dramatic improvements can
be expected by polarizing the atoms into the absolute
ground state F = 3, mF = 3. The phase-space density
can be increased by a factor of seven, and by produc-
ing identical bosons the elastic collsion rate goes up by
nearly a factor of two. Moreover, Feshbach tuning can
be applied to modify the s-wave scattering length [10].

We have already performed ﬁrst experiments, in which
we have demonstrated that atoms the GOST can be op-
tically pumped into the state of interest [29].

The spatial compression of the atomic gas can be en-
hanced by adding a far red-detuned laser beam to the
GOST. If such a beam propagates vertically in the cen-
ter of the hollow beam it provides an additional potential
well for transverse conﬁnement. As an example, a 500-
mW beam from a compact Nd:YAG laser focused to a
1/e-diameter of 0.1 mm already provides a dipole poten-
tial Ured of ∼3µK depth. In the GOST such an additional
well can be loaded by elastic collisions, which in thermal
equilibrium would result in a peak density enhancement
of exp(|Ured|/kBT ) along with a corresponding increase
in phase-space density [30].
Another interesting option with an additional far red-
detuned laser beam is to create a double-EW trap as
suggested in Ref. [31]. The combination of a repulsive
blue-detuned EW in combination with an attractive red-
detuned EW of much larger decay length would allow to
create a wavelength-size potential well very close to the
dielectric surface. In such a scheme, a situation can be

7

realized where only one vertical bound state exist. The
situation would then be similar to atomic hydrogen on
liquid helium, for which a two-dimensional quantum gas
has been reported [32]. The realization of such a system
with alkali atoms could provide much more insight into
the physical behavior of such a 2D gas.

In addition to such experiments on quantum gas prop-
erties, the GOST also represents a very promising source
of ultracold atoms for experiments related to, e.g., atom
interferometry [33], atom-surface interactions [34, 35],
and quantum chaos [36].

[29] For optical Zeeman pumping we use a weak circulary
polarized beam resonant with the F = 3 → F ′ = 3
transition and aligned parallel to a static magnetic ﬁeld

8

of a few Gauss. In addition the usual GOST repumping
light with mixed polarization provides hyperﬁne repump-
ing via the F = 4 → F ′ = 4 transition. In this scheme
the state of interest (F = 3, mF = 3) is the only dark
state and thus eﬃciently populated. In a Hanle-type ex-
periment [19] we have observed that the pumping beams
lead to very weak heating in the presence of the longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld. With a transverse magnetic ﬁeld
destroying the dark state, strong heating was observed.
This conﬁrms the predominant population of the dark
state.

We develop an exact sum rule that relates the spectral shift of a trapped gas undergoing cold
collisions to measurable quantities of the system. The method demonstrates the dependence of
the cold collision frequency shift on the quantum degeneracy of the gas and facilitates extracting
scattering lengths from the data. We apply the method to analyzing spectral data for magnetically
trapped hydrogen atoms and determine the value of the 1S − 2S scattering length.

PACS: 03.75.Fi, 32.80.Pj

The broadening and shifting of spectral lines of a gas
by collisions was among the earliest discoveries in the
development of high precision spectroscopy [1]. The
pressure shift, which originates in interatomic pertur-
bations [2],
is particularly simple to interpret at low
temperatures where the thermal de Broglie wavelength
ΛT = h/(2πmkBT )1/2 is much larger than the scatter-
ing length a [3] and the interactions arise only through
s-wave scattering. In this cold collision regime, the fre-
quency shift is much larger than the level broadening.

The theory of the cold collision shift has been devel-
oped to interpret hyperﬁne transitions in cryogenic hy-
drogen masers and laser cooled atomic fountains [4]. In
this work we study the shift for optical excitation in a sys-
tem that can be quantum degenerate, and apply the re-
sults to data on 1S−2S two–photon excitation of trapped
atomic hydrogen [5].

For the case of a homogeneous sample of density n,
and a coherent, weak excitation that couples two inner
states of the atoms, we ﬁnd

¯h∆ωcoll = g2(λ12 − λ11)n ,

λαβ = 4π¯h2aαβ/m . (1)

Here g2 is the equal point value of the second order corre-
lation function [6], g2 ≡ g(2)(~r = 0), the state 1(2) is the
ground(excited) state, and aαβ is the s-wave scattering
length for α − β collisions.

Equation (1) shows that quantum correlations in the
system are manifest in the collision shift. For a uniform
Bose gas in thermal equilibrium g2 = 2 − (nBEC/n)2 [7],
where nBEC is the density of condensed atoms. Above the
condensation temperature, when nBEC = 0, g2 equals 2,
in which case Eq.(1) is in agreement with previous work
[4]. At zero temperature, for a pure condensate with
nBEC = n, the collision shift is half of the shift for a non-
condensed gas. Equation (1) generalizes the result [4] to
T < TBEC and relates the spectral shift to the condensate
fraction.

It is quite remarkable that the factor g2 in Eq.(1) mul-
tiplies both λ12 and λ11. This results from correlations
between an excited atom and other atoms. During the
excitation, the internal states of the atoms are rotated:
cos θ(t)|1Si + e−iφ(t) sin θ(t)|2Si. The angles θ(t), φ(t)
depend on laser power and on the atom’s trajectory in

1

the laser ﬁeld, speciﬁc for each atom. However, for small
excitation power, the angle θ(t) is small, and thus the
internal states of all atoms remain nearly identical while
the laser is on, even if the excitation ﬁeld is spatially
nonuniform. Therefore, during the excitation the atoms
interact as identical particles. This causes the short range
statistical correlations in the initial state to be replicated
in the excited state of the gas, which results in the sta-
tistical factor g2 in the ﬁrst term of Eq.(1).

The transfer of spatial correlations to the excited state
is not limited to weak excitation. For the case of strong
excitation, spatial correlations in the ground state will
also be transferred to the excited state, but only pro-
vided the excitation scheme is coherent. The diﬀerence
between coherent and incoherent cases can be seen from
comparing two examples, the coherent superposition of
the ground and excited states obtained, e.g., by a π/2
pulse, and the incoherent mixture state resulting from
saturating the Rabi transition. These states will both
have equal populations in the two internal states, but
quite diﬀerent correlations. In the former case of a pure
internal state the spatial correlation will be the same as
for the ground state of indistinguishable particles. In the
latter case of a mixed state the correlations will be re-
duced. Consequently, the correlation energy of the ﬁrst
state will exceed that of the second state by the factor
g2.

To emphasize the non-trivial character of the result
Eq.(1), let us point out that ¯h∆ωcoll diﬀers from the ther-
modynamic work needed to transfer one atom from the
state 1 to the state 2. The latter work, calculated by
removing one atom from the sample, and then introduc-
ing an atom in state 2 from far away, ignoring entropy,
is given by (λ12 − g2λ11)n. Here λ12n is the energy of
interaction of the excited atom with the atoms in the
state 1, and g2λ11n is the chemical potential of a Bose
gas. The key diﬀerence between this process and optical
excitation, resulting in the diﬀerent dependence on g2, is
the incoherence of the state of the added atom with the
initial state of the sample.

To calculate the full optical spectrum shape of a
trapped gas in the cold collision regime, other factors
would have to be considered in addition to the eﬀects

of statistical correlations. Optical coherence can be lost
via dephasing elastic collisions, giving rise to collisional
broadening. One would have also to take into account
atomic motion in the trap and the eﬀects of the inho-
mogeneous density distribution in the sample, especially
in the Bose-Einstein condensate.
In addition, the in-
teraction may give rise to a doublet structure of the
spectrum [9]. Altogether, these eﬀects can lead to a
complicated broadened spectrum with asymmetric lines
[5,10,11]. However, we demonstrate below that the spec-
trum’s center of mass obeys a simple and exact sum rule
and is insensitive to these additional eﬀects.

We lay out the theory of the shift by deriving a sum
rule (Eq.(12)) that relates the center of mass of the ob-
served spectrum to measurable experimental parameters.
The sum rule bridges between the uniform density re-
sult Eq.(1) and experimentally measured spectra. The
sum rule accounts for all interactions between atoms oc-
curing in the s−wave scattering channel, which includes
It follows from the
the s−wave collisional broadening.
sum rule that collisional broadening as well as the time
of ﬂight broadening resulting from atomic motion in the
trap do not contribute to the spectral shift. At the same
time, the eﬀects on the shift of inhomogeneity in the gas
density and non-uniformity in the excitation ﬁeld are ex-
pressed in the sum rule Eq.(12) in an exact and straight-
forward way.

We start by considering a homogeneous Bose gas and
derive Eq.(1). Then for the realistic situation of a
trapped gas sample we derive the sum rule Eq.(12), a
generalization of Eq.(1). The sum rule is exact and
general, applicable both to Doppler-free and Doppler-
sensitive spectra. Finally we apply the sum rule to exper-
imental data on the spectrum of cold trapped hydrogen
to calculate the 1S − 2S scattering length for hydrogen.
The system: To provide the context for the theory, we
brieﬂy describe the experimental situation. The temper-
ature of the hydrogen is 30 − 100 µK, well below the cold
collision threshold T ≃ 1 K [3]. The atoms are spin
polarized and interact in the triplet channel. Calculated
values of the 1S−1S and 1S−2S triplet scattering lengths
are a11 = 0.0648 nm [14] and a12 = −2.3 nm [18]. We
neglect 2S − 2S scattering because the excitation rate
is assumed low (in the experiment typically 10−4 of the
atoms are excited) so the background gas is essentially
pure 1S. Since |a12| ≫ a11, collisions between 1S and 2S
atoms dominate the shift, which is to the red.

Each atom will be in some superposition of the ground
state 1S and the excited state 2S. In the second quanti-
zation formalism, the atoms are described by the canon-
ical Bose operators ψ1(r) and ψ2(r). The Hamiltonian is
H = H0 + Hint, where H0 describes atoms freely moving
in the trap, and Hint is the interaction term:

(3)

Here U (r) is the trap potential (essentially the same for
the 1S and the 2S states).

Inelastic collisions, such as collisions in which the hy-
perﬁne level of one or both of the colliding partners
changes, may contribute additional shifts which are not
accounted for in this formalism. However, these eﬀects,
as well as the three-body collision eﬀects, are small in the
experiment and can be neglected.

The two-photon 1S − 2S spectrum consists of Doppler-
free and Doppler-sensitive excitations. In the Doppler-
free situation, the transition results from absorbing two
counter-propagating photons with equal frequencies and
zero net momentum. In the absence of interactions, the
resonance condition is 2ωlaser = ω0, where ω0 corresponds
to the resonance of a single free atom. In the Doppler-
sensitive situation, the transition is caused by two pho-
tons propagating in the same direction. For a free atom,
the resonance frequency is shifted by the recoil energy:
2¯hωlaser = ¯hω0 + (2k)2/2m, where k = ¯hω/c is photon
momentum and m is the atom mass.

Radiative excitation in a many particle system is de-

scribed by adding to the Hamiltonian (2),(3) the term

where ω = 2ωlaser − ω0. The two–photon excitation ﬁeld
A(r) is equal, up to a constant factor, to the square of the
electric ﬁeld. Spatial variation of A(r) in the Doppler-
free case occurs on a scale set by the focused laser beam
diameter, and in the Doppler-sensitive case is given by
˜A(r) cos(2kr+φ(r)), where ˜A(r) and φ(r) are slowly vary-
ing functions.
A tutorial example: Before discussing the general
case, here we derive the mean frequency shift for the
Doppler-free transition caused by a uniform excitation
ﬁeld A(r) = A0,
ignoring the 1S − 1S interactions
(λ11 = 0). To that end, consider a gas of N atoms con-
ﬁned in a box of volume V . Since we ignore the 1S − 1S
interaction, the many body state ground state of the sys-
tem Φ0 is simply a symmetrized product of single particle
states. It can be characterized by occupation numbers
nj of the single particle plane wave states V −1/2eikj r,
j nj = N . Initially, the internal state of all atoms is

1S.
P
The excited state, to lowest order in the excitation, is
given by Φ1 = HradΦ0. We consider the norm k Φ1 k2
and the expectation value of the interaction hΦ1|Hint|Φ1i.
The ratio of these quantities gives the mean frequency
shift. Because Φ0 is the product of plane wave states in
a box, the frequency shift can be evaluated exactly.
The norm hΦ1|Φ1i of the excited state is given by

We start with the Golden Rule formula for the absorption

To evaluate the norm one ﬁrst puts the operators ψ2(r)
and ψ+
2 (r′) in (5) in normal order by using the commu-
tation relation [ψ2(r), ψ+
2 (r′)] = δ(r − r′). Noting that
ψ2(r)|Φ0i = 0, the norm is given by

The sum rule for the spectrum I(ω) is found by eval-

uating the ﬁrst moment:

To obtain the frequency shift ∆ωcoll, we consider the ex-

The formal reason for the factor 2 to appear in Eqs. (8, 9)
and, eventually for g2 to appear in Eq.(1), is the follow-
ing. In taking the average in Eq.(7) by Wick’s theorem
[13], there are two essentially diﬀerent ways to pair the
operators, analogous to the Hartree and Fock contribu-
tions to the energy. For short range interaction between
bosons, the Hartree and Fock contributions are equal and
as a result the frequency shift is twice as large as the
“mean density” result.

In the thermodynamic limit, V, N → ∞, n = N/V con-
stant, the second term in Eq.(9) contributes only when
there are states ﬁlled by a macroscopic number of par-
ticles. For example, in thermodynamic equilibrium at
T < TBEC, the shift Eq.(9) is λ12(2n − n2
c/n), whereas in
a non degenerate gas, at T > TBEC, the shift is 2λ12n.
The sum rule: We turn now to deriving a sum rule that
generalizes the result Eq.(1) to non-homogeneous sam-
ples and spatially varying excitation ﬁeld (and λ11 6= 0).

tions, ﬁrst from the interaction Hamiltonian, second from

The ﬁrst term in Eq.(16) generalizes the ordinary mo-
mentum recoil energy shift to the trapped gas prob-
lem [15]. The second term represents the Doppler shift
due to possible macroscopic gas ﬂow in the sample.
To clarify this, consider A(r) = A0eipr/¯h, which would
describe Doppler-sensitive excitation. Then Fkin =
(p2/2m − ~p · ~v)n d3r/¯h3, where ~v = ~j/n is the
|A0|2
local velocity. The sensitivity of the frequency shift to
motion within the sample, manifest in the second term
in Eq.(16), makes it possible, in principle, to detect vor-
tices in the condensed state.

There are two comments concerning the generality of
the sum rule. First, note that in deriving the sum rule
Eq.(12), we do not assume thermodynamic equilibrium.
The result is exact and applies to non-equilibrum sys-
tems for which the factor g2 may diﬀer from its equilib-
rium value. Second, the above derivation of the sum
rule assumes coherence of the excitation described by
(4). One can see, however, that the results (14),(16),(18)
hold as well for an incoherent excitation ﬁeld of the form
A(r)eiωt+iφ(t) with a ﬂuctuating phase φ(t). Also, it is

straightforward to generalize the results for the excita-
tion ﬁeld with diﬀerent spatial dependence of diﬀerent
frequency components.
Analysis of the data: To investigate the utility of the
sum rule, we applied it to extract a value for a1S−2S from
data on the 1S − 2S transition in hydrogen for a normal
gas. An account of the experimental situation and ex-
amples of the spectral data will be published elsewhere
[16]. Evaluating the integrals in the sum rule requires
knowing the excitation ﬁeld A(r), the value of g2, and
the density n(r). The excitation ﬁeld is generated by a
Gaussian beam which is fully characterized by a single
parameter, the beam radius, which can be accurately de-
termined. For temperatures above TBEC, g2 = 2. At
lower temperatures, g2 depends on the temperature.

The density n(r) was found by measuring the peak den-
sity and knowing the properties of the trap. The peak
density n0 was determined by exploiting the property
that the BEC critical density is accurately described by
the ideal gas expression: nc = 2.612(2π¯h2/kBT m)3/2.
If the system is at the transition point then measuring
the temperature determines the density. The system was
cooled into the condensate regime and the spectrum was
observed as the condensate decayed. The spectrum was
measured after the condensate had decayed for ten sec-
onds, when the presence of a small though visible con-
densate assured that the peak density n0 had its critical
value. The contribution of the condensate to the spec-
trum was unimportant. Thus, the only quantity required
to apply the sum rule was the temperature. This was
found by measuring the width of the Doppler-sensitive
spectrum [17].

From the experimentally measured spectrum we found
¯ν = −29 ± (2) KHz. We numerically calculated the inte-
grals on the right hand side of Eqs.(14),(18) and found
that 2(λ12 − λ11)/h = 4.4 ± (1.7) × 10−10 Hz cm3, where
the major sources of uncertainty are the temperature and
the trap and laser geometry. From this we determined
the 1S −2S scattering length to be a12 = −1.6±(0.7) nm.
This result is in reasonable agreement with the calculated
value [18], a12 = −2.3 nm.

An alternative approach to extracting the scattering
length was used in Ref.
[5], where the value a12 =
−1.6 ± (0.3) nm was reported. The interpretation em-
ployed a semiclassical description of the atomic motion
and a local density description of the phase shift. The
present method is more direct and, we believe, more reli-
able. It can be viewed as a check on the earlier analysis,
and a conﬁrmation of the calculation of the dipolar decay
constant [20] on which it depends.

In reference [10], an internally consistent description
of the density of the condensate required assuming that
the density shift parameter in the condensate was the
same as in the normal gas, rather than half as large as
expected from this analysis. This anomaly remains to be
explained.

As a speculative explanation, one could consider a
state close to the transition temperature in dynamical
in which several low
but not in thermal equilibrium,
energy states are populated with macroscopic occupa-
tion numbers. For example, for N particles distributed
equally among m states, one has ni = N/m, i = 1, ..., m
in Eq.(8). Then from Eq.(9) ¯h∆ωcoll = (2 − 1/m)λ12n,
i.e., the shift is described by an eﬀective g2 = 2 − 1/m.
For a large number m of constituent states, the eﬀective
g2 can be arbitrarily close to 2.

In summary, we have shown that quantum statistical
correlations of a cold gas sample are imprinted in the
collisional shift of the center of mass of an optical ab-
sorption spectrum. In the cold collision regime the sum
rule Eq.(12) can be applied to determine the statistical
correlation factor g2 from optical spectrum. The sum
rule is valid for any gas in the cold collision regime. It
takes into account possible inhomogeneities in the sample
and the excitation ﬁeld, and it is valid above and below
TBEC. Also, the sum rule is valid for a non-equilibrium
system, with g2 values possibly diﬀerent from those in
equilibrium. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the
sum rule by using it to extract the 1S − 2S scattering
length for hydrogen from experimental data.

It should be pointed out that our results, the frequency
shift (1) and the sum rule (12), are only valid at small
mixing angles of the 1S and 2S states. The cold colli-
sion shift at large angle mixing is an important problem,
particularly for atomic clocks. The generalization of the
results (12) and (1) for such systems is an interesting
open problem.

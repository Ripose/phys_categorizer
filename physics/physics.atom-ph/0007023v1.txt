Abstract

The ﬁne structure interval of P states in hydrogenlike systems can be de-
termined theoretically with high precision, because the energy levels of P
states are only slightly inﬂuenced by the structure of the nucleus. Therefore
a measurement of the ﬁne structure may serve as an excellent test of QED
in bound systems or alternatively as a means of determining the ﬁne struc-
ture constant α with very high precision. In this paper an improved analytic
calculation of higher-order binding corrections to the one-loop self energy of
3P and 4P states in hydrogen-like systems with low nuclear charge number
Z is presented. The method of calculation has been described earlier [1] and
is applied here to the excited P states. Because of the more complicated na-
ture of the wave functions and the bound state poles corresponding to decay
of the excited states, the calculations are more complex. Comparison of the
analytic results to the extrapolated numerical data for high Z ions [2] serves
as an independent test of the analytic evaluation. New theoretical values for
the Lamb shift of the P states and for the ﬁne structure splittings are given.

I. INTRODUCTION

Evaluations of the radiative corrections in higher order for bound states are an involved
task because of the appearance of a multitude of terms, and because of the diﬃculties
associated with bound state formalism. In this paper, we present an improved calculation
of higher order corrections to the one–loop self energy of an electron in an excited 3P or 4P
state.

For the contribution δESE of the one–loop radiative correction to the Lamb shift of a
bound electron, we have the following non-analytic expansion in powers of Z times the ﬁne
structure constant α

δESE =

(2)

(Zα)2hA6,2 ln2(Zα)−2 + A6,1 ln(Zα)−2 + A6,0 + (Zα) GSE,7i .

The remainder function GSE,7 is of order 1 and is comprised of the terms A7,0 and higher
coeﬃcients. Corrections A4,1, A5,0 and A6,2 vanish for P states. The terms A4,0 (see, e.g.,
[3]) and A6,1 [3,4] are known analytically. The term A4,0 contains the Bethe logarithm which
has been evaluated to 12 signiﬁcant ﬁgures [5,6]. Results have not been obtained for A6,0
coeﬃcients. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the A6,0 coeﬃcients for the 3P1/2,
3P3/2, 4P1/2 and 4P3/2 states. The results lead to improved values for the Lamb shift of the
respective states and to a new theoretical value for the ﬁne structure splitting. We give an
explicit formula for the ﬁne structure of the 2P, 3P and 4P states as a function of the ﬁne
structure constant α, which can be used to obtain a value of α from experimental data.

In this paper, we brieﬂy compare some of the methods that have been developed for the
treatment of the one–loop problem. We give a brief account and illustrate the usefulness of
the ǫ-method [1,7] for analytic evaluations. We then describe the evaluation of the high–
energy part to the self energy, with a focus on details of the integration procedure. We then
proceed to the low–energy part. Results of the calculation are given, speciﬁc contributions
are discussed in detail.

II. VARIOUS METHODS OF TREATMENT OF THE ONE–LOOP SELF

ENERGY

Using units in which ¯h = c = 1 and e2 = 4πα, we can write the integral corresponding

to the one–loop self energy of an electron bound in a Coulomb ﬁeld,

mass counter term as a function of M, δm(M) = α (3/(4 π)) m (ln(M 2/m2)+1/2). ¯ψ = ψ† γ0
denotes the Dirac adjoint. It is straightforward to derive Eq. (3) with the Feynman rules of
QED. By rescaling all variables to the electron mass scale

we have

We will use variables rescaled to the electron mass in this paper, and suppress the prime of
the rescaled variables in the sequel. Note that in our system of units, we have (e. g.) for the
Bohr radius of the atom aBohr = 1/(Zα). By contrast, in atomic units, which are used for
example in [8], we would have the Bohr radius of length unity.

The analytic properties of the propagators determine the location of the poles in the
integrand in Eq. (3) as indicated in Fig. 1. The original Feynman prescription calls for
integrating the photon energy along the contour CF . For the actual evaluation of the Lamb
shift, however, a diﬀerent contour of integration is used by most authors. Taking advantage of
the analytic properties of the integrand and of Jordan’s lemma, one can change the Feynman
contour in the complex plane without changing the result of the calculation. We compare
here the contour used in Bethe’s original derivation of the Lamb shift, the contour used by
Mohr in [9–12], and the contour used in Pachucki’s ǫ method, which is used in this paper.
Mohr’s and Pachucki’s methods both depend on a division of the calculation into a low
and a high–energy part. Mohr’s method relies on the contour CM in Fig. 2. His low–energy
part is determined by the part of the contour CM where Re(ω) < ǫ. The residues of the
poles of the photon propagator only contribute to low–energy part in this case. It can be
shown that the low–energy part is given by the formula

(cf. Eq. (3.8) in [9], HD is the Dirac Hamiltonian). This contribution contains terms of lower
order in (Zα) than (Zα)4. The spurious lower order terms cancel when the low and the high–
energy parts are added in that method. The high–energy part is obtained by Wick-rotating
the Feynman contour for ω integration along the line with Re(ω) = En. In the non-relativistic
limit, expression (6) corresponds (up to the term α/π En) to what would be expected to be
the self energy of the electron in terms of traditional second order perturbation theory due
to transverse modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,

K in Eq. (7) is an appropriate energy cutoﬀ to make the expression ﬁnite (for a derivation
of Eq. (7) cf. [13], Eq. (7-112) to Eq. (7-115) ibid., where in the relativistic case one has
to substitute α for 1/i∇). In Mohr’s method, K corresponds to En. Bethe’s derivation of
the Lamb shift, which gave the right scaling of the eﬀect of the self energy and correctly
identiﬁed A4,1, but did not include the contribution to the Lamb shift of order α/π(Zα)4
due to the anomalous magnetic moment, comprised the expression given in Eq. (7), but
with a major modiﬁcation. Bethe subtracted from (7) the contribution that would modify
the energy (or mass) of a free electron due to its self interaction. This contribution would
give a contribution to the rest mass of any electron, and thus would be unobservable. In our
terminology, Bethe’s non-relativistic (NR) expression would be written

where HS is the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian, φ is the non-relativistic wave function, and the
subtracted term −1/k in the integrand corresponds to the portion of mass renormalization
attributable to the low–energy part. By taking the principal value (P), we identify the real
part of Eq. (9) as the energy shift, whereas the imaginary part corresponds to the decay
width of the state |φi. Using the subtraction, Bethe disposed of the spurious lower-order
terms and obtained a ﬁnite expression.
In Pachucki’s method (see Fig. 3), an expression similar to Eq. (7) is obtained in the
non-relativistic limit for the low–energy part, but with an upper cutoﬀ epsilon for the pho-
ton energy. This cutoﬀ epsilon separates the low and the high–energy parts. In the dipole
approximation exp(ik · r) → 1, one obtains the expression

(10)

for the low-energy part in leading order. The renormalization term −1/k is gone, and the
upper cutoﬀ has been changed from K = m to K = ǫ. The justiﬁcation for leaving out the
renormalization term is intimately linked to the special series expansion prescription used
by Pachucki.

Pachucki’s method relies on the fact that the low–energy part and the high–energy part
may formally be regarded as functions of the ﬁne structure constant α and the cutoﬀ pa-
rameter ǫ. Their sum, however, the self energy of the electron δE,

δE(α) = EL(α, ǫ) + EH (α, ǫ),

(11)

does not depend on epsilon, provided the high and the low–energy parts are expanded ﬁrst
in α, and then in epsilon (the order of expansion plays a crucial role in that case).

Another important point in Pachucki’s method is that the spurious lower order terms
which were present in Mohr’s calculation vanish in the limit ǫ → 0, so we do not need to

4

originated from a trivial integrationR En
change the upper limit of integration to ǫ and calculate limǫ→0R ǫ

take them into account. For example, in Mohr’s calculation, the ﬁrst spurious term (α/π) En
0 dk α/π = (α/π) En. In Pachucki’s method, we would
0 dk α/π = 0. That means
by choosing the ǫ prescription, we not only make the expression for the low–energy part
separately ﬁnite, but also dispose of the spurious lower order terms. That is the principal
reason why Pachucki’s method is well suited for the analytic calculation of higher order
corrections to the one–loop self energy.

The choice of epsilon remains arbitrary to a certain extent (it has to be because we ana-
lytically expand in ǫ and thus require arbitrariness). However, we must put some restraints
on the magnitude of ǫ. In the high–energy part, we expand the propagator of the bound
electron in powers of the binding ﬁeld V . We initially assume a ﬁxed value for ǫ which pre-
vents infrared problems, but since eventually ǫ → 0, this expansion is regarded as a formal
expansion that is not necessarily convergent. However, ǫ may not be arbitrarily large. If we
let ǫ > 2m, we enclose poles not only from the photon propagator, but also from the negative
spectrum of the Dirac-Coulomb propagator, which would signiﬁcantly alter our expression
for the low–energy part. It is also required that in the entire domain of the low–energy part,
an expansion of the expression

in the matrix element

αj e−ik·r|ψi

in powers of k · r corresponds to an expansion in powers of Zα (this requirement justiﬁes
the so-called dipole approximation, in which we replace exp(ik · r) by unity to obtain the
lowest order contribution to the self energy). The order of magnitude of r is 1/(Zα) in
natural units. Thus we require ǫ < (Zα). The dominant contribution is then determined by
the region in which the photon energy k ≡ ω = O((Zα)2), so that k · r = O(Zα). In this
paper we consider the relativistic corrections up to relative order (Zα)2. This corresponds to
expanding exp(ik·r) up to (k·r)2. Our restrictions on the magnitude of ǫ do not compromise
the validity of analytic expansion in the parameter ǫ.

Note that we may leave out iǫ prescription when integrating along CH since we take the
diﬀerence of the integrand inﬁnitesimally above and below the real axis on CH . Along the
positive real axis, the integrand has branch cuts due to the photon and electron propagators
as depicted in Fig. 1. The expression given in Eq. (12) for EH is infrared divergent. In the
evaluation, we start by calculating the matrix element

˜P = h ¯ψ|γµ

6 p− 6 k − m − γ0V

γµ|ψi

(14)

up to the order of (Zα)6. As outlined in [1], this can be achieved by ﬁrst expanding the
electron propagator in powers of the binding Coulomb ﬁeld V . This leads to a 3-vertex, a
double-vertex, a single-vertex and a zero-vertex part. The expansion can be diagrammatically
represented as in Fig. 4. The resulting expressions are subsequently expanded in powers of the
spatial electron momenta pi. This procedure is feasible for P states because up to order (Zα)6,
all of the resulting matrix elements converge. After performing the algebra of the Dirac
matrices, the resulting matrix elements on the P state are evaluated by symbolic procedures
written in the computer algebra system Mathematica [14]. For the evaluation, we ﬁrst
expand the wave function (given by the exact solution to the Dirac-Coulomb equation)
in powers of (Zα), then we apply operators in coordinate space representation and ﬁnally
integrate the resulting expressions with the help of a set of rules that apply to standard
integrals. The integrands which are to be evaluated for the matrix elements have lengths of
up to 2,000 terms.

We use a parametric representation of the mass counter term to allow for local cancella-

tion of the divergences. It can be shown that

is a suitable parametric representation of the mass counter term along the contour CH. The
portion of mass renormalization along the contour CL vanishes in the limit ǫ → 0, and we
have

Therefore, by (locally) subtracting the expression

before the ﬁnal dω d3k [1/(ω2 − k2) − 1/(ω2 − k2 − M 2)]-integration in Eq. (12), we can
subtract the divergences associated with mass renormalization.
Note that δml contains the matrix element h ¯ψ|ψi, which is state dependent. Using the
virial theorem for the Dirac-Coulomb equation (hα · pi = −hV i), we have h ¯ψ|ψi = Eψ,
where Eψ is the dimensionless Dirac energy of the state ψ.

We give here the result for the renormalized matrix element

The ﬁnal integrations with respect to the photon momenta are done in a diﬀerent way
for the terms in ˜Pren which require regularization and those which do not. The terms which
require regularization are integrated covariantly by Feynman parameter techniques and a
subsequent Wick rotation. These terms are not integrated along CH, but rather along C ′
H.
They are not infrared divergent, so we may put ǫ = 0 for these terms. Those terms which
do not require regularization are integrated in an essentially non-covariant way. The d3k
integration is carried out ﬁrst, then we proceed to the dω integration.

The integration procedure for the terms which require regularization is as follows. We
isolate in ( ˜P − δml) those terms which would be ultraviolet divergent if integrated with the
unregularized photon propagator. We denote these terms by ˜P div

ren . We then evaluate

All terms in ˜P div

By simple power counting arguments, it can be shown that ˜P div

ren is exactly the sum of
those terms of order kn where n ≥ −2 for large k. Therefore, the terms contributing to ˜P div
ren
can easily be isolated. The terms in ˜Pdiv, can obviously be written as the sum of terms of
the form

˜Pdiv = Xi

pi(|k|, ω)

[k2 + 2ω − ω2]ni

(23)

where pi is a polynomial in |k| and ω and deg(pi) ≥ ni−2. The entirely covariant integration
procedure for the divergent terms will be outlined here. The terms in Eq. (23) need to be
multiplied by the factors 1/(ω2 − k2) and 1/(ω2 − k2 − M 2) from the regularized photon
propagator. We use Feynman parameters in the form

to join the denominators. Identifying A1 = −ω2 + k2, A2 = −ω2 + k2 + M 2 and B =

1/(ω2 − k2),

where

A1 (1 − x) + Bx = −˜k2 + D1

˜k = (˜ω, k) = (ω − x, k)

and D1 = x2,

and for the contribution from the renormalization part of the photon propagator

we have

It is easy to prove that the dependence on the temporary upper cutoﬀ Λ disappears when the
contribution due to the unregularized and the regularization part of the photon propagator
are subtracted (D1 and D2).

As the ﬁnal step, we integrate over the parameter x introduced in Eq. (24) and subse-
quently investigate the resulting expression in the limit M → ∞. The respective expressions
vanish as M → ∞ for all states considered in this paper. This fact is intimately linked
to our using the entirely covariant Feynman parameter approach for the integration of the
divergent terms. If we had used a non-covariant scheme of integration, as in [7], then we
would have had to take into account ﬁnite correction terms to obtain the correct result for
the Lamb shift.

Note that the (divergent) spurious terms of order (Zα)2, which are present in all of the
matrix elements ˜Pren, vanish after we have performed the d4k integration in the way outlined
above, which includes ﬁnal expansion in the ǫ parameter.

The terms in ˜P ﬁn

One can dispose of the factors k2 in the numerator of the integrand using the following
procedure. First write k2 as

k2 = Y − 2ω + ω2,

so Y = k2 + 2ω − ω2 corresponds to the denominator in Eq. (29). The resulting expression
is subsequently expanded. The powers of Y cancel, and the result does not carry powers of
k in the numerator any more.

(34)

(35)

(36)

in order to carry out the integration in Eq. (33). The formula Eq. (34) deserves some com-
ments. We are integrating along the real axis. Because ω and Ω both have an inﬁnitesimal
imaginary part all along the contour of integration CH, the positions of the poles of the
integrand are well deﬁned.

The branch cuts of the function F (ω) can be readily identiﬁed. Due to the term
sgn(Im(ω)) ω in the ﬁrst term on the right hand side in (34), there is a branch cut along
the positive real axis. This branch cut is caused by the photon propagator. Due to the term
√Ω in the second term on the right hand side in (34) there is also a branch cut along the
line where the expression Ω = 2ω − ω2 assumes negative real values. This branch cut ex-
tends from ω = 2 along the positive real axis to ω = ∞. It is caused by the Dirac-Coulomb
propagator (see Fig. 1).

It can be explicitly checked that the function F (ω) satisﬁes the equation

Note that the ǫ-prescription calls for carrying out the u-integration from u(ǫ + i 0+) to 0
and subsequently expanding the result in powers of ǫ up to ǫ0. For those terms which are
ﬁnite when integrated from 1 to 0 we may carry out this integration without regarding the
dependence on ǫ. For instance,

Z 0

introduce a divergence in 1/˜ǫ. We have

IV. THE LOW–ENERGY PART

The low–energy part of the energy shift originates from low–energy virtual photons. The
energy of the photons is comparable in magnitude to the binding energy of the electron
(order (Z α)2). Therefore it is impossible to expand the electron propagator in powers of the
binding ﬁeld. We have to treat the binding ﬁeld non-perturbatively. An expansion in powers
of (Z α) is accomplished by considering the spatial momenta of the virtual photon and the
electron momenta as expansion parameters.

Choosing the Coulomb gauge for the photon propagator, one ﬁnds that only the spatial
elements of this propagator contribute [1]. The ω-integration along CL is performed ﬁrst,
which leads to the following expression for EL,

EL = −e2P Z|k|<ǫ
HD denotes the Dirac-Coulomb-Hamiltonian HD = α·p+β m+V , δT is the transverse delta
function, and αi refers to the Dirac α-matrices. The principal value of the above integral is
the real quantity corresponding to the energy shift in one–loop order. The imaginary part
of the CL integration, which leads to the decay–width of the state, has been dropped in Eq.
(59). In the matrix element

(ω ≡ |k|).

(59)

P ij = hψ|αiei k · r

we introduce a unitary Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation U,

P ij = hUψ|(U αiei k · r U +)

1

U (HD − (Eψ − ω)) U + (U αje−i k · r U +)|Uψi.

(60)

(61)

The lower components of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformed Dirac wave function ψ vanish
up to (Zα)2, so that we may approximate |Uψi by

17

|Uψi = |φi + |δφi with hφ|δφi = 0,

(62)

where |φi is the non–relativistic (Schr¨odinger-Pauli) wave function, and |δφi is the relativistic
correction.
We deﬁne an operator acting on the spinors as even if it does not mix upper and lower
components of spinors, and we call the odd operator odd if it mixes upper and lower com-
ponents. The Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian consists of even operators only. For the upper
left 2 × 2 submatrix of this Hamiltonian, we ﬁnd the result [13]

HFW = U (HD − (Eψ − ω)) U + = m + HS + δH,

(63)

where HS refers to the Schr¨odinger–Hamiltonian, and δH is is the relativistic correction,

δH = −

It is interesting to note the reason why we can ignore the lower 2 × 2 submatrix of the
FW Hamiltonian in our scheme of calculation. The lower 2× 2 submatrix contains the terms
−m−(Eψ−ω) ≈ −2 m as the dominating (Z α)0 contribution. Therefore the integral vanishes
in the limit ǫ → 0. This can be checked by considering the integral in Eq. (59), inserting
a spectral resolution for the Dirac Coulomb propagator and performing the integral over
d3k after suitable angular averaging. The upper 2× 2 submatrix has no (Z α)0 contribution,
because terms proportional to m and Eψ cancel. This submatrix contributes to the Lamb
shift. Now we turn to the calculation of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transform of the operators
αi exp (k · r). The expression U αi exp (ik · r) U + is to be calculated. Assuming that ω = |k|
is of the order O((Zα)2), we may expand the expression U αi eik · r U + in powers of (Zα).
The result of the calculation is

U αieik · r U + = αi(cid:18)1 + i (k · r) −

In the limit ǫ → 0 the odd operators in the above expression do not contribute to the self
energy in (Zα)2 relative order, because up to (Zα)2 relative order, these operators only
join the upper components of the wave function with the lower components of the Dirac
Coulomb Hamiltonian. This contribution vanishes, as described. So one can neglect the odd
operators. By using symmetry arguments, it can be shown easily that the last term in the
above expression (proportional to k × Σ) does not contribute to the Lamb shift in (Zα)2
relative order for ǫ → 0, either.
Because we can ignore odd operators, and because the lower components of the Foldy-
Wouthuysen transformed wave function vanish, we keep only the upper left 2× 2 submatrix
of Eq. ((65)), and we write U αi eik · rU + as

This can be rewritten as

(66)

(67)

where δyi is of order (Zα)3. It is understood that the term pi
m eik · r is also expanded up to
the order (Zα)3. Denoting the Schr¨odinger energy by E (E = −(Zα)2 m/n2 for nP states)
and the ﬁrst relativistic correction to E by δE, we can thus write the matrix element P ij as

We now deﬁne the dimensionless quantity

(69)

Up to (Zα)2, we can write the matrix element P as the sum of the contributions ((70), (71),
(72), (73), (74), (75)). The leading contribution (the “non-relativistic dipole”) is given by

Pnd =

Almost all of the above contributions are calculated using a coordinate space representation
of the Schr¨odinger Coulomb propagator given in [1] and [15]. Formulae given in [17] and
[16] prove useful for the summation over the intermediate quantum numbers. For the non-
relativistic quadrupole contribution, however, we use the momentum space representation
due to Schwinger [19]

We then perform the calculation of PNQ in momentum space using formulae given in the
paper by Gavrila and Costescu [18]. The momentum space wave functions of P states are
given in [19]. Calculations for PNQ become increasingly complex. It should be noted that in
the case of the 4P wave function, one has to deal with intermediate expressions of up to
20,000 terms. We do not describe these calculations in any further detail. Evaluations for
this part of the calculation were done on IBM RISC/6000 systems with the help of the
computer algebra system Mathematica [14].

The ﬁnal ω integration is done by change of variable

ω → t, where

t =

q1 + (2 n2 ω)/((Z α)2 m)

(78)

(t = 0 corresponds to ω = ∞, and t = 1 corresponds to ω = 0). As an example for a
P matrix element, we give here the result for a contribution to PδH (4P1/2), caused by the
Russell-Saunders coupling term in the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformed Dirac Hamiltonian:

where Ψ denotes the logarithmic derivative of the Γ function. The quadratic singularity in
the result for PL·S(4P1/2) in Eq. (79) at t = 3/4 (given by the (−3 + 4t)2–term in the de-
nominator of the purely rational function) corresponds to the decay into the 3D state. One
can check explicitly that the insertion of corresponding intermediate states in the spectral

22

decomposition of the propagators necessitates the existence of quadratic singularities in the
P matrix elements, and that the quadratic singularities occur only in the matrix elements
with two propagators. The quadratic singularities are a consequence of the perturbative
treatment of δH in the propagator 1/(HS + δH − (Eφ + δE − ω)) (expansion in δH is not
allowed in the vicinity of a pole of the resolvent G(E) = 1/(HS − E)). The integration pro-
cedure for the quadratic singularities is as follows: ﬁrst we isolate and calculate analytically
the integral of the term that gives rise to the singularity (as a function of t), then we take
the diﬀerence of the edge terms at t = 1 and t = 0. This procedure takes back the eﬀect of
the perturbative treatment and assigns the correct value to the t integral. As the ﬁnal step,
we subtract the term that gave rise to the quadratic singularity and proceed with the rest
of the terms in the usual way described in [1].

The integration procedure deserves some further comments. We also encounter in the
matrix elements singularities of linear type at t = 1/4, t = 1/2 and t = 3/4, which also cor-
respond to the decay of the excited state. The residue taken at these singularities yields the
decay width of the respective states. In order to obtain the principal value of the t-integral,
one has to symmetrize the integrand around all the singularities. This is also accomplished
by symbolic procedures written in the computer algebra language Mathematica.

The results of the calculations have been checked in many ways. An important cross-
check is the cancellation of ǫ-divergent terms in the sum of the high and low–energy parts. By
considering the expansion of the propagators in powers of 1/ω, the logarithmic singularities
of all contributions can be calculated individually and agree with the results obtained from
complete evaluation.

The contributions to the low–energy part FL in (Zα)2 relative order are given in Table
I and Table II. Summing all contributions, we obtain the following complete results for the
contribution of the low energy parts FL:

of the vacuum polarization contribution implicitly contained in the quoted equation):

A6,0(3P1/2) = −1.14768(1), A6,0(3P3/2) = −0.59756(1),

and

A6,0(4P1/2) = −1.19568(1), A6,0(4P3/2) = −0.63094(1).

The new results for A6,0 are the main results of this work. They are in excellent agreement
with data obtained from numerical calculations by one of the authors (PJM) and Y. K. Kim

[2]. Mohr and Kim calculate the F function deﬁned in (2) numerically for Z ≥ 10, treating
the binding ﬁeld non-perturbatively. By extrapolating their numerical data [2] to the region
of small Z, we obtain the following estimates for the remainder function GSE,7 implicitly
deﬁned in Eq. (2).

The uncertainties in GSE,7 are used to estimate the theoretical uncertainty from the one–
loop contribution. When modeling the numerical data, it must be taken into account that
as noted by Karshenboim [20], A7,1 coeﬃcients vanish for P states. Values of A6,0 and GSE,7
for 2P states are given in [1]. We use the following implicit deﬁnition of the Lamb shift L:

E = mr [f (n, j) − 1] −

m2
r

2(m + mN )

[f (n, j) − 1]2 + L + Ehfs,

(100)

where E is the energy level of the two-body-system and f (n, j) is the dimensionless Dirac
energy, m is the electron mass, mr is the reduced mass of the system and mN is the nuclear
mass. It should be noted that we consider the hfs–fs mixing term as a contribution to the
hyperﬁne structure. The small hfs-fs-mixing correction which is discussed in [21], mixes the
F = 1 sublevels of the P1/2 and P3/2 states and shifts the center of the hyperﬁne levels. It
should be taken into account when the ﬁne structure is deduced from precision experiments.
In order to calculate the Lamb shift, we include the Barker-Glover correction to hydrogen
energy levels [22], which we refer to as the (Zα)4 recoil correction. We also include the (Zα)5
recoil correction calculated by E. Salpeter [23], and the results [24] for recoil corrections of
order (Zα)6 mr/mN . The results for recoil corrections of order (Zα)6 mr/mN have been
conﬁrmed by K. Pachucki (see ch. 5 of [1]). We include contributions from the higher order
two–loop correction of order (α/π)2 (Zα)6 ln2(Zα)−2 corresponding to the B6,2–coeﬃcient
[25], and for three–loop corrections in lowest order. The theoretical error from the two–loop
contribution (B6,1 and higher terms) is estimated as half the contribution from the recently
calculated B6,2–coeﬃcient. The higher order contributions due to vacuum polarization of
order α/π (Zα)6 can be obtained by analyzing the small distance behavior of the Dirac wave
function, i.e. by evaluating the matrix element of the Uehling potential (see e.g. [27]),

for the leading term. We have also evaluated the contribution of the Uehling potential
numerically without expansion in Zα with the results

GU,7(3P1/2, Z = 1) = 0.0455, GU,7(3P3/2, Z = 1) = 0.0249,

(104)

and

GU,7(4P1/2, Z = 1) = 0.0480, GU,7(4P3/2, Z = 1) = 0.0262

(105)

where the function GU,7 is deﬁned in analogy with GSE,7. The contribution of the higher-
order terms is negligible compared to the uncertainty in the higher-order self energy terms.
The Wichmann-Kroll vacuum polarization contribution is expected to be of order (Zα)2
times the Uehling correction and is not included here.

The above mentioned contributions to the Lamb shift are listed in the Tables III and IV
for the states under investigation. It should be noted that the reduced mass dependence of
the terms must be restored in low Z systems to obtain the correct value for the Lamb shift.
Terms which are caused by the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron acquire a factor
(mr/me)2 (where mr is the reduced mass of the system and me the mass of the electron), all
other contributions to the Lamb shift acquire a factor (mr/me)3. In addition, the argument
of the logarithms ln[(Z α)−2] must be replaced by ln[(me/mr Z α)−2]. The relevant formulae
are also given in [3]).

It should also be noted that for two–loop and three–loop corrections in respective lowest
order (α/π)2 (Zα)4 and (α/π)3 (Zα)4, only the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
contributes to the Lamb shift for P states, because the Dirac form factor F1(q2) is infrared
ﬁnite in two– and three–loop order. So it is only the contribution from the magnetic form
factor F2(q2 = 0) which persists. The calculation of the contribution to the Lamb shift is
then straightforward.

We obtain the following theoretical results for the Lamb shift of 3P and 4P states:

L(3P1/2) = −3473.75(3) kHz,

L(3P3/2) = 4037.75(3) kHz,

L(4P1/2) = −1401.52(1) kHz,

L(4P3/2) = 1767.30(1) kHz.

(109)

The theoretical values for the ﬁne structure splitting, using the 1987 Cohen–Taylor value of
α−1 = 137.0359895(61) [28], are as follows:

∆Efs(3P) = 3250089.8(3) kHz

∆Efs(4P) = 1371130.0(1) kHz

(110)

(111)

For 2P states, the theoretical value is ∆Efs(2P) = 10969043(1) kHz [1]. The uncertainty in
the theoretical values for the ﬁne structure splitting is given by the uncertainty in α. Any

26

determination of the ﬁne structure beyond the quoted uncertainty would yield a value of α
improved with respect to the 1987 value. Given the scattering of available data for α [29],
such a determination could be useful for checking the consistency of measurements coming
from diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics.

The formula for the ﬁne structure as a function of α for atomic hydrogen (Z = 1) is as

follows:

∆A6,0(n) and ∆G(n) are deﬁned as

∆G(n) = GSE,7(nP3/2) − GSE,7(nP1/2).

(115)

For practical purposes, the n-dependence of ∆GSE,7(n) may be suppressed, because it is a
very small contribution (in the 1 Hz range), and we may assume ∆GSE,7(n) ≈ −1.0. The
two– and three–loop coeﬃcients to the anomalous magnetic moment are given by [29]

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The analytic calculation of higher order binding corrections to the Lamb shift of excited
P states has been described in this paper. We provide more accurate theoretical values of
the Lamb shift for 3P and 4P states in hydrogenlike systems.

We also give a formula for the ﬁne structure as a function of α (for 2P, 3P and 4P states),

which may be used to determine α from an improved measurement of the ﬁne structure.

With the possibility of substantial improvement in the precision of spectroscopic experi-
ments (trapped atoms), a better determination of α from measurement of the ﬁne structure

27

might be within reach in the near future. Such a determination of the ﬁne structure con-
stant α, from the eﬀect on which its name is based, would complement other high precision
determinations from solid state physics and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.
We note that there are deviations of experimental data for excited nS–nP transitions
from theory by more than one standard deviation but less than two standard deviations
(see [21] and references therein). However, both theory of the Lamb shift and spectroscopic
techniques have improved since the measurements were made, so one might expect a more
precise comparison of theory and experiment in the future. The present uncertainty in the
theory would in principle allow a determination of the ﬁne structure constant with a relative
uncertainty of less than 5 parts in 109. However at this level of precision additional theoretical
work might be needed to address questions such as asymmetries in the natural line shape.
We only mention that for excited states, an experimental determination of the ﬁne structure
could be simpliﬁed by the slower decay (narrower line width) of the higher excited P states
[8].

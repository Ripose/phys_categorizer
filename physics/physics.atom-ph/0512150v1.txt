Abstract. We present a method to obtain power-balanced laser beams for doing
quantum-state manipulation experiments with phase-stable double optical lattices.
Double optical lattices are constructed using four pairs of overlapped laser beams with
diﬀerent frequency. Our optical scheme provides a phase stability between the optical
lattices of 5 mrad/s and laser beams with a very clean polarisation state resulting in
a power imbalance in the individual laser beams of less than 1%.

Multiple power-balanced laser beams for quantum-state manipulation experiments

1. Introduction and background

Optical lattices are periodic arrays of shallow microscopic traps in which ultra-cold
atoms can be trapped [1, 2]. The trapping potential is a consequence of a second-
order interaction between the atomic dipole moment and an applied light ﬁeld [3]: the
associated energy, which is proportional to the irradiance, is generally referred to as the
light shift. The periodicity emerges when the total light ﬁeld is built up by two or more
interfering laser beams.

Optical lattices are widely used as a tool for a range of diﬀerent scientiﬁc studies.
In particular, they have lately been extensively utilised in experiments involving Bose-
Einstein Condensates [4] and quantum-state manipulation [5]. In the latter context, cold
atoms in optical lattices have been suggested as a promising candidate for a platform
for quantum computing.

The attractiveness of optical lattices in attempts to realize rudimentary quantum
gates, and in subsequent more ambitious steps towards a quantum computer, comes
mainly from the very eﬃcient isolation from ambient eﬀects. Early suggestions for
quantum information processing with optical lattices [6, 7, 8] do however impose strict,
and sometimes conﬂicting technical demands on the optical lattice.

In this paper, we present a solution to one of several problems that needs to be
solved in order to realize a quantum gate and to enable other classes of highly controlled
quantum-state manipulation. We have previously presented a way to realize a double
set of independent 3D optical lattices that are phase stable [9]. Many of the details
behind the phase control and the acquired stability can be found in [10].

1.1. Power balance

When generating a 3D optical lattice with four (minimum) or more laser beams, it can
be, depending on the application in mind, paramount to have balanced power in the
beams. One example of this is when the depth and the oscillation frequency of the
potential wells have to be precisely known (and reproducible) for controlled preparation
of q-bits or for general investigations of the properties of optical lattices. Another
example is when using the optical lattices in order to controllably induce small directed
drifts in the atomic population [11].
In the latter case, a spurious drift caused by a
power imbalance is likely to wash out the desired eﬀect.

As long as the optical lattice is of a standard type, involving only one wavelength,
power balance is trivial, e.g. by attenuation of the individual beams. However, in many
suggestions for how to realize quantum computing with optical lattices, more than
one wavelength is needed. In our set-up for double optical lattices, we use two laser
colours, albeit close in wavelength, and in order to keep the spatial phases of the optical
lattices stable, we have to use an elaborate scheme where light from two diﬀerent lasers
are overlapped with crossed polarisation [10]. Eventually, the double optical lattice is
formed by eight laser beams arranged in four pairs. Each pair contains two laser ﬁelds

of diﬀerent wavelengths but with identical spatial mode. In this case, it is not possible
to control the power of all beams individually.

In a recent experiment, where a 3D controllable Brownian motor was demonstrated
[11], the rudimentary power balance in the ﬁrst experiments with double optical lattices
was not enough. Therefore, an optical system for controlling the power, without
compromising the phase control had to be devised.

2. Methodology

2.1. Double optical lattices

A double optical lattice is two overlapped optical lattices that have identical topography,
but that can be controlled individually in terms of well depths and spatial phase. The
inherent diﬃculty is that of those two prerequisites, the former requires that the two
lattices are built up by the same wavelength, whereas the latter requires individual
beams of diﬀerent wavelengths in order to avoid cross talk. We have solved this (c.f.
[9, 10]) by utilising a domain and a parameter set where the two wavelengths are
separated enough, and where the resonances are narrow enough, in order to accomplish
independent addressing of the lattices. At the same time, the wavelengths are close
enough, and the sample volume is small enough (1–2 mm in diameter), to ensure that
the periodicity is constant for practical purposes (it takes 3–4 cm for the lattices to
phase out).

2.1.1. Phase-stability and phase-control of the double optical
lattice Since optical
lattices are created in interference patterns, the resulting spatial phase of an optical
lattice will depend heavily on the optical phases of all laser beams involved. When
using two optical lattices built up by diﬀerent wavelengths, it is crucial that this is
under control.

To start with, we choose a conﬁguration with only four beams per 3-dimensional
lattice (one beam more than the dimensionality [12]). This ensures time constant
topography in each individual lattice. A phase shift in any one of the four laser beams
will only result in a global translation of the lattice, and that on a time scale which is
typically irrelevant for the atomic dynamics in the lattice. This also means that even
though we generate the two colours with independent lasers, these lasers do not have to
be phase locked to each other. All phase ﬂuctuations, including those in the laser, that
happen before the laser light is split up into several branches, will appear identically in
all these branches. Thus, the spatial phase of the interferogram will remain constant
regardless of such ﬂuctuations.

Phase ﬂuctuations in an individual beam will however lead to a global translation of
the lattice. Since we operate two lattices, built up by individual laser ﬁelds, the control
of the relative phase between the lattices will deteriorate if this is not dealt with. We
solve this by combining the two laser frequencies, with crossed polarisation, before they

are split up into four branches (see ﬁgure 1). To ensure that the spatial modes actually
become identical, we inject this pair of beams into a single-mode optical ﬁbre. After
the output of the ﬁbre, the crossed polarisation of the beam pair is rotated such that it
becomes 45◦ with respect to the plane of incidence of a polarising beam-splitter cube.
Thus, two beam pairs are obtained, where each contains two laser frequencies, but now
with the same polarisation. These are then split up yet again to provide four branches
of beam pairs. To ensure equal and clean polarisation in all branches, each beam pair
ﬁnally passes a half-wave plate and a polarising beam splitter cube. A phase ﬂuctuation
in an optical component, caused for example by mechanical noise, will now occur in
an identical way for both optical lattices. Thus, insigniﬁcantly slow global translations
still happen, but these are now synchronised between the lattices. The relative phase of
the lattices remains constant, as long as the mechanical ﬂuctuation is less than several
centimetres.

Figure 1. Optical conﬁguration for ensuring phase stability for a double optical
lattice. Beams (red and blue) from two lasers, with diﬀerent frequencies, and with
crossed polarisations are overlapped with a polarising beam-splitter cube. They are
then injected, together, into a single-mode optical ﬁbre. They exit the ﬁbre, still with
approximately crossed polarisation. The polarisations are rotated before the pair is
split up by a polarising beam-splitter. The emerging two beam pairs now each consist
of two frequency components, but now with parallel polarisations within each pair.
These pairs are then split up again in order to provide the needed four beams pairs,
where the two frequency components in each respective branch are in the same spatial
mode.

The relative phase can still be manipulated. It can be set by varying the optical
path length of an individual beam pair. This is made by changing the distance between
two retro-reﬂectors [10]. Since the wavelengths are so close, this distance has to be
changed in the order of a centimetre in order to impose a signiﬁcant phase variation.
The relative phase can also be manipulated fast by using electro-optical modulators.

2.2. Polarisation control and power balance

Despite the great care taken to have clean polarisations, it seems impossible to obtain
good power balance in the four beams pairs with the set-up shown in ﬁgure 1. First,
the polarisation state of the two beams coming out of the optical ﬁber is not stable,
and shows some ellipticity. This causes a power imbalance of more than 30% in the
four branches. Second, the polarising beam splitter cubes we use reﬂect up to 5% of
the p-wave, which ought to be transmitted, while less than 0.5% of the s-wave, which
should be reﬂected, is transmitted. These defects introduce an asymmetry in the system
that cannot be compensated for when simultaneous power balance in the four beams for
both lasers is required. Compensating for the unequal power ratios in the four beams
for one laser, by adjusting the half-wave plates, leeds to a larger power imbalance for
the other laser.

To quantify the power imbalance caused by the imperfect polarising beam splitter
cubes, we calculated the power in the four beams for both lasers using Jones matrix
formalism [13]. Figure 2 shows the calculated relative power imbalance in the four beams
for both lasers as a function of the defect of the polarising beam splitter cubes, i.e., the
relative amount of light of the p-wave that is reﬂected rather than transmitted. The
fact that both lasers have a diﬀerent dependency on the polarising beam splitter cube
defect makes it impossible to balance the beams for both lasers.

the polarising beam-splitter cube defect (the amount of light in the p-wave that is
reﬂected) for laser A (solid line) and laser B (dashed line).

The key to obtain the necessary power balance is polarisation control. In ﬁgure 3, we
show how the optical set-up has been upgraded. First, when the beams are combined, it
is crucial to ensure normal incidence to the ﬁrst beam splitter, and that ellipticities
in the polarisations are eliminated. The combined beam pair is then injected to
a 10 m long bow-tie stressed polarisation maintaining optical ﬁbre [14]. This ﬁbre

is speciﬁcally designed to maintain two diﬀerent,
orthogonal polarisations. The mixing of polarisation in the ﬁbre is speciﬁed to be
maximum one part in 105 per meter. Also, the output polarisation state is determined
by the orientation of the ﬁbre in the mount, and is therefore stable in time. After the
output from the ﬁbre, ellipticity is again eliminated and the polarisations of the beam
pair is rotated with the respect to the subsequent polarising beam splitter just as before.
In each output arm of this beam splitter, where the polarisations should now be perfectly
linear, the polarisation state is further cleaned by installing Glan-Thompson polarisers,
with a speciﬁed maximum polarisation impurity of one part in 105. For all polarising
beam splitter cubes, also after the ﬁbre, it is important that the optical incidence is
normal.

The Glan-Thompson polarisers ensure that in each of the two arms, both laser
beams have exactly the same polarisation before being split-up further. With this well-
deﬁned polarisation state, it is possible to obtain power balance between all of the
four branches. The eﬀect of the Glan-Thompson polarisers on the power imbalance
is depicted in ﬁgure 4.
In this ﬁgure, the power imbalance of both lasers show the
same dependency on the polarisers beam-splitter cube defect; the curves for both lasers
completely overlap. The power in branches A and B will be slightly less than the power
in branches C and D (see ﬁgure 3), due to the defect of the ﬁrst beam splitter cube
after the optical ﬁbre. However, this can now easily be compensated for by adjusting
the half-wave plates in arms C and D.

Figure 3. Improved optical conﬁguration, necessary for having power balanced beams.
In order not to compromise the phase-stability, the main features of the original set-up
(as depicted in ﬁgure 1) must be preserved. In the improved set-up, the optical ﬁbre
has been replaces by a bow-tie stressed polarisation maintaining ﬁbre, and great care
has been taken to clean up polarisations, for example by introducing Glan-Thompson
polarisers (G1 and G2). The photo of the ﬁbre cross-section is courtesy of Fibercore

3. Results and conclusions

With the current set-up, we can maintain a phase-stability of 5 mrad/s. This stability
is determined by thermal ﬂuctuations and mechanical vibrations that cause path-length
ﬂuctuations in the individual optical paths of the laser beams. We can set the power
imbalance to be maximum 1% for both optical lattices simultaneously. The balancing
is limited by the accuracy of the power meters that are used to measure the power of
the beams in each branch.

The improvement to the double optical lattice experiments were crucial for our
recent experiments on Brownian motors [11] and will also be in future work on quantum
gate and quantum state manipulation in general. In [11] we can detect induced atomic
drift velocities as small as 0.1 mm/s. The spurious drift caused by imbalanced power in
the beams is still one of the limiting factors for this detection.

The method presented can potentially be useful also to general interferometric

applications where multiple frequencies are applied with a high level of control.

Abstract

The mathematical methods that have been used to analyze the
statistical properties of boson ﬁelds, and in particular the coher-
ence of photons in quantum optics, have their counterparts for
Fermi ﬁelds. The coherent states, the displacement operators,
the P-representation, and the other operator expansions all pos-
sess surprisingly close fermionic analogues. These methods for
describing the statistical properties of fermions are based upon
a practical calculus of anti-commuting variables. They are used
to calculate correlation functions and counting distributions for
general systems of fermions.

1 Introduction

The Pauli exclusion principle plays an essential role in describing the behav-
ior of the particles, both simple and complex, that we now call fermions. It
is known to play a key role in determining the structure of the most fun-
damental elements of matter. These are systems like atoms, in which the
phase-space density of fermions, electrons in this case, is quite high. But
when fermionic atoms move freely in space or even when they are trapped
electromagnetically, their phase-space density is usually so low that the ef-
fects of the exclusion principle remain completely hidden. A number of re-
cent developments, however, point to the possibility of achieving much higher
densities of fermionic atoms both in electromagnetic traps and in free space.

The various methods of optical cooling that have been developed for
atomic beams work as well for fermions as they do for bosons and produce
beams with temperatures of the order of 100 µ◦K. Cooling fermions evapora-
tively to still lower temperatures poses a problem that requires a less direct
solution. Evaporative cooling becomes ineﬃcient for fermions since the ex-
clusion principle tends to suppress collisions of identical atoms. It may be
implemented nonetheless by sympathetic means [1], e.g., by cooling bosonic
atoms at the same time, so that energy exchange still takes place freely.
It seems possible thus that the realization of degenerate Fermi gases may
become an important byproduct of Bose-Einstein condensation.

The detection methods that will be used in measurements on beams of
cold fermionic atoms will be essentially the same as those now used on bosonic
atoms cooled by optical or evaporative means. The measurements on bosons
can be most conveniently described, in fact, by mathematical methods that
were introduced in the context of quantum optics [2, 3].

Much of the work in quantum optics, we may recall, is couched in the
language of coherent states, which are eigenstates of the photon annihilation
operators. They contain an intrinsically indeﬁnite number of quanta but can
nonetheless be used as a basis for describing all states of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. While pure coherent states are not physically attainable in bosonic
systems with ﬁxed numbers of particles, it likewise remains useful to describe
boson ﬁelds in terms of suitably weighted superpositions and mixtures of
coherent states. The weight functions associated with these combinations

1

may be regarded as quasi-probability densities in the spaces of coherent-
state amplitudes. The function P in the coherent-state representation of
the density operator [2, 3] plays this role; other quasi-probability densities
including the Wigner function [3, 4] and the Q function [3, 4] play similarly
convenient roles in representing the density operator.

In the case of fermion ﬁelds, the vacuum state is the only physically
realizable eigenstate of the annihilation operators. It is possible, however, to
deﬁne such eigenstates in a formal way and to put them to many of the same
analytical uses as are made of the bosonic coherent states. Since fermion ﬁeld
variables anti-commute, their eigenvalues must, as noted by Schwinger [6],
be anti-commuting numbers. Such numbers are Grassmann variables. They
can be handled by means of the simple rules of Grassmann algebra [7], which
we include here so that the calculations may be self-contained.

Within this context we formulate ways of expressing and evaluating a
broad range of the correlation functions that are measured in experiments
involving the counting of fermions. Central to this task is the expression of
the quantum-mechanical density operator in terms of Grassmann variables.
We develop a number of ways of doing that in general terms and present
a detailed discussion of the density operators for chaotically excited ﬁelds.
Included among the latter is a particularly useful Gaussian representation
of the grand-canonical density operator for fermion ﬁelds. Having evaluated
the statistically averaged correlation functions, we apply them to fermion
counting experiments and illustrate their use in determining the counting
distributions.

We ﬁnd throughout this work that notwithstanding great mathematical
diﬀerences, many close parallels can be established between the expressions
evaluated for fermion ﬁelds and the more familiar ones for boson ﬁelds. In
particular, for example, we can construct a family of quasi-probability den-
sities, as functions of the Grassmann variables, with properties parallel to
those of the entire family of quasi-probability densities for bosons, including
the P , Q, and Wigner functions. We can then evaluate the mean values of
ordered products of fermion creation and annihilation operators by perform-
ing integrations over the Grassmann variables while using the appropriate
quasi-probability density as a weight function. In both cases, we trade an in-
homogeneous commutation relation and an ordering rule for a homogeneous

2

commutation relation and a quasi-probability density. For boson ﬁelds the
integrations are taken over commuting variables, which may be treated as
if they were classical variables. For fermions, on the other hand, the inte-
grations are over anti-commuting variables that have no classical analogues.
The weight functions for these integrations are nevertheless in one-to-one
correspondence with the quasi-probability densities for bosons, so it seems
appropriate to give them similar names. We have followed that convention
for several other parallels as well.

One of the useful properties of Grassmann numbers is that when, as in the
preceding deﬁnition, they multiply fermionic annihilation or creation op-
erators, their anti-commutativity cancels that of the operators. Thus the
operators a†
= j. So we may rewrite the
displacement operator as the product

deﬁned in terms of bilinear forms in anti-commuting variables, there is no
need to adopt a standard ordering of the modes.

4 Grassmann Calculus

4.1 Diﬀerentiation

Since the square of any Grassmann variable vanishes, the most general func-
tion f (ξ) of a single anti-commuting variable ξ is linear in ξ

(34)

(35)

(36)

f (ξ) = u + ξt.

df (ξ)
dξ

= t.

f (ξ) = u

tξ.

−

We deﬁne the left derivative of the function f (ξ) with respect to the Grass-
mann variable ξ as

Note that if the variable t is anti-commuting, then we may also write the
function f (ξ) in the form

Now to form the left derivative, we ﬁrst move ξ past t, picking up a minus
sign and obtaining the form (34) and the result (35). In this case, the right
t. In the present work, we shall use left derivatives exclusively
derivative is
and shall refer to them simply as derivatives.

−

4.2 Even and Odd Functions

It is useful to distinguish between functions that commute with Grassmann
variables and ones that do not. We shall say that a function f (α) that
commutes with Grassmann variables is even and that a function f (α) that
anti-commutes with Grassmann variables is odd . We shall often note the
evenness or oddness of the functions we introduce.

8

4.3 Product Rule

To compute the derivative of the product of two functions f (α) and g(α)
with respect to a particular variable αi, one may explicitly move the αi in
g(α) through f (α) or one may move the operator representing diﬀerentiation
through the function f (α). In either case if the function f (α) is odd, then
one picks up a minus sign. The product rule is thus

∂
∂αi

∂f (α)
∂αi

(f (α) g(α)) =

g(α) + σ(f ) f (α)

(37)

∂g(α)
∂αi

,

where the sign σ(f ) of f (α) is
is even.

−

1 if f (α) is an odd function and +1 if f (α)

4.4

Integration

We deﬁne a sort of integration over the complex Grassmann variables by the
following rules

This integration due to Berezin [7] is exactly equivalent to left diﬀerentiation.

We shall typically be concerned with pairs of anti-commuting variables

αi and α∗

i , and for such pairs we shall adhere to the notation

in which the diﬀerential of the conjugated variable comes ﬁrst. Note that

4.7 Completeness of the Displacement Operators

For a single mode, the identity operator I and the traceless operators a, a†,
and 1
a†a form a complete set of operators. Since by using the expression
(12) and our Grassmann calculus, we may write each of these operators as
an integral over the displacement operators

it follows that the displacement operators form a complete set of operators
for that mode. It is easy to generalize this proof to the multi-mode case. The
displacement operators are over-complete.

5 Operators

Some operators can be written as sums of products of even numbers of cre-
ation and annihilation operators; we shall call such operators even. Operators
that can be written as sums of products of odd numbers of creation and an-
nihilation operatorswe shall shall speak of as odd. Although most operators
are neither even nor odd, the operators of physical interest are either even or
odd. The number operator a†a, for example, is even, while the creation and
annihilation operators, a† and a, are odd.

The operators of quantum mechanics and of quantum ﬁeld theory do not
themselves involve Grassmann variables. Thus even operators commute with
Grassmann variables, while odd ones anti-commute.

5.3 Physical States and Operators

A state
rotation of angle 2π about any axis,

ψ

i

|

is physical if it changes at most by a phase when subjected to a

U(ˆn, 2π)

ψ

= eiθ

ψ

.

(69)

i
Since fermions carry half-odd-integer spin, a state of one fermion or of any
odd number of fermions changes by the phase factor
1. States that contain
no fermions or only even numbers of fermions are invariant under such 2π
rotations.

−

i

|

|

14

Thus physical states are linear combinations of states with odd numbers
of fermions or linear combinations of states with even numbers of fermions.
But a state that is a linear combination of a state that contains an odd
number of fermions and another that contains an even number of fermions
is excluded. For instance, the state

1
√2

+

(

0

|

i

1

)

|

i

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

is unphysical because under a 2π rotation it changes into a diﬀerent state:

U(ˆn, 2π)

|

i

We deﬁne an operator as physical if it maps physical states onto physical

states. Physical operators are either even or odd.

In all physical contexts that have been explored experimentally, the num-
ber of fermions (or more generally the number of fermions minus the num-
ber of anti-fermions) is strictly conserved. That conservation law leads to
certain further restrictions on the permissible states of the ﬁeld. If we let
N =
kak be the fermion number, the law requires that any state arising
from an eigenstate of N must remain an eigenstate of N. This law can be
derived from an assumed U(1) invariance of all the interactions under the
transformation U(θ) = exp (iθN), which changes a and a† to

k a†

P

and

e−iθN aeiθN = eiθa

e−iθN a†eiθN = e−iθa†.

Fermion conserving interactions involving the ak and a†
k are ones in which the
phase factors e±iθ all cancel. If a system begins in a state with a ﬁxed number
of fermions, the conservation law restricts the set of accessible states consid-
erably more than the 2π super-selection rule mentioned earlier. Transitions
can not be made, for example, between states with diﬀerent even fermion
numbers or between states with diﬀerent odd fermion numbers.

5.4 Physical Density Operators

A physical density operator can be written as a sum of dyadics of physical
states with positive coeﬃcients that add up to unity. It follows that a physical
density operator ρ is a positive hermitian operator of unit trace: for any state
ψ

|

i

Physical density operators are invariant under a 2π rotation. Thus the

one-mode operator

for example, is a physical density operator, but the dyadic

is not. In this work we shall consider only density operators that are physical
in this sense.

The dynamical problems we solve do not always begin with a ﬁxed number
of fermions. More generally they begin with a mixture of states with diﬀerent
fermion numbers, that is with density operators of the form

where the pN ′ are real and non-negative. Such density operators are invariant
under the transformation U(θ) = exp(iθN), and the fermion conservation law
assures us that they will always remain so,

The coherent states do undergo a simple change under this transforma-

given by the similar formula

commute with Grassmann variables.

8.1 The S-Ordered Characteristic Function

We may deﬁne a more general ordering of the annihilation operator an and
the creation operator a†
n, much as we did earlier for boson-ﬁeld operators [4].
It is an ordering speciﬁed by a real parameter s that runs from s =
1 for
anti-normal ordering to s = 1 for normal ordering. For the quadratic case,
the s-ordered product for fermions is

−

nan}s = a†

1),

to which we append the trivial deﬁnitions

n}s = a†

{

and

an}s = an.

{

We note that the deﬁnition (119) diﬀers by a crucial sign from that [4] of
s-ordering for bosonic operators bn and b†
n:

In particular the anti-normally ordered product

of the anti-normally ordered function χA(ξ) = χ(ξ,

This is one sense in which the operator EA(ξ) is related to anti-normal or-
dering.

By using the s-ordered operators D(ξ, s) and E(ξ, s), we may generalize

the expansions (103) and (112) of the arbitrary operators F and G to

F =

The obvious generalization

Tr [F G] =

10 Quasi-Probability Distributions

both W (α, s) and χ(ξ, s) are even functions. It follows now from the expan-
sion (143) that the s-ordered quasi-probability distribution W (α, s) is the

12 The P-Representation

Of the representations (151) for the density operator ρ, by far the most
important is the one for s = 1 with the normally ordered weight function
P (α) = W (α, 1). By Eq.(145) it takes the simple form

which recalls the P representation [2]–[3] for boson ﬁelds. Since the function
P (α) is even, we may also write

ρ =

Because Grassmann integration is diﬀerentiation, the fermionic P represen-
tation is not aﬀected by the mathematical limitations [2]–[5] that restricted
somewhat the use of the bosonic P representation.

The P-representation may be used directly to compute the mean values

This extremely useful relation is just a special case of Eq.(166) for s = 1.

Since the operator ˜E(α, 1) is the dyadic (147) of the eigenstates of the cre-

13 Correlation Functions for Fermions

A principal use of the P representation for bosonic ﬁelds has been the evalu-
ation of the normally ordered correlation functions, which play an important
role in the theory of coherence and of the statistics of photon-counting experi-
ments [2]. The analogously deﬁned correlation functions for ﬁelds of fermionic
atoms can be shown to play a similar role in the description of atom-counting
experiments [9]. If we use ψ(x) to denote the positive-frequency part of the
Fermi ﬁeld as a function of a space-time variable x, then the ﬁrst two of these
correlation functions may be deﬁned as

G(1)(x, y) = Tr
G(2)(x1, x2, y2, y1) = Tr

ρψ†(x)ψ(y)
ρψ†(x1)ψ†(x2)ψ(y2)ψ(y1)
(cid:3)

(174)

(cid:3)

The nth-order correlation function is

G(n)(x1, . . . , xn, yn, . . . , y1) = Tr

ρψ†(x1) . . . ψ†(xn)ψ(yn) . . . ψ(y1)

.

(177)

14 Chaotic States of the Fermion Field

The reduced density operator for a single mode of the fermion ﬁeld can be
represented by a 2
2 matrix for the states with occupation numbers 0 and
1. If the matrix is diagonal, it is speciﬁed completely by the mean number
in the mode. The density operator for the kth mode, in other
n

words, must take the form

We shall speak of this density operator as representing a chaotic state of the
kth mode. A chaotic state of the entire ﬁeld will then be represented as a
direct product of such density operators for all the modes of the ﬁeld,

so that N can not be ﬁxed unless all the
take the values 0 or 1. The
indeﬁniteness of the number of particles present is a feature that the chaotic
states of the fermion and boson ﬁelds have in common. For suﬃciently large
values of N, however, the ﬂuctuations of N/
may be quite small so the
speciﬁcation of N in these relative terms may be quite precise. Fluctuations
of this type in the number of particles present are a familiar property of the
grand canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics, and that ensemble, as we
shall see, represents a special class of chaotic states.

The latter result is a particularly useful one since there are many physical con-
texts that call for the averaging of normally ordered products of annihilation
and creation operators. For chaotic ﬁelds one may calculate all such averages
as Grassmann integrals by making use of the fermionic P-representation with
P (α) given by Eq.( 196).

The minus signs in front of the expressions (195) and (196) may be some-
what surprising since these functions are the fermionic analogues of quasi-
probability densities that are predominantly positive for boson ﬁelds. It is
worth pointing out, therefore, that these signs result from our convention
that deﬁnes d2α as dα∗dα. Had we chosen the diﬀerential instead to be
dαdα∗, the signs would have been positive.

For a chaotically excited boson ﬁeld, the P-representation expresses the
density operator as a gaussian integral of a diagonal coherent-state dyadic.
For fermion ﬁelds the corresponding expression of ρk for a single mode is

What we have shown, in eﬀect, is that the two expressions are identical and
that statistical averages can be evaluated by means of gaussian integrations
for fermions as well as for bosons. The multi-mode density operator is rep-
resented, of course, by the product of the single-mode density operators,
ρ =

k ρk.

Fields in thermal equilibrium with a suitable particle reservoir represent
particular examples of the kind of chaotic excitation we have been describing.
If it is appropriate to describe such ﬁelds by means of the grand canonical
ensemble, then their overall density operator may be written as

ρ =

Ξ(β, µ)

e−β(H−µN ),

(199)

(200)

where β = 1/kBT , µ is the chemical potential, H is the hamiltonian for the
system, N is the particle number, and the normalizing factor Ξ(β, µ) is the
grand partition function. For a ﬁeld with dynamically independent mode
functions labeled by the index k, we can write

H =

15 Correlation Functions for Chaotic Field

We have introduced a succession of normally ordered correlation functions
G(n)(x1 . . . xn, yn . . . y1) in section 13, and shown how they can be expressed
as integrals over the Grassmann variables α =

ﬁelds, the appropriate weight function is

αk}

P (α) =

the product of the gaussian functions in Eq.(196). The ﬁrst-order correlation

If we form the variational derivative of Γ with respect to ζ(x1) from the left
and with respect to η∗(y1) from the right, subsequently setting ζ and η to
zero, then we ﬁnd an alternative expression for the ﬁrst-order correlation
function,

It is evident then that one may generate all of the higher-order correlation

functions by performing further diﬀerentiations,

. . .

G(n)(x1 . . . xn, yn . . . y1) =

To evaluate the generating functional Γ for a chaotic ﬁeld, we make use of the
orthonormality of the mode functions φk and then carry out the Grassmann
integration

G(1)(x1, y2)G(1)(x2, y1). (215)

The generalization to nth order is immediate. It expresses the nth-order
correlation function for chaotic ﬁelds as a sum of products of ﬁrst-order
correlation functions with permuted arguments,

G(1)(xj, yP j).

The expression of the nth-order correlation function in terms of ﬁrst-
order correlation functions is characteristic of chaotic ﬁelds. Such ﬁelds are
completely speciﬁed by the set of mean occupation numbers
, and these
are already contained in the ﬁrst-order correlation function.

16 Fermion Counting Experiments

The use of photon counting techniques has for many years been the most
direct means of investigating the statistical properties of light beams. Ex-
periments of this type began with that of Hanbury Brown and Twiss [8]
in 1956 and expanded greatly in scope with the development of the laser.
The theory [3] underlying these experiments is based on the evaluation of
quantum-mechanical expectation values of normally ordered products of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld operators. The coherent states of the ﬁeld [2] thus play a
special role in the formulation of that theory. The application of the theory,
furthermore, extends to boson ﬁelds of much more general sorts, including
for example beams of heavy atoms [9].

38

In the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, it has been shown [3] that the
probability of detecting n photons in a given interval of time can be expressed
as the nth derivative with respect to a parameter λ of a certain generating
function

(cid:1)

For the case of fermion ﬁelds, it can easily be shown [9] that the prob-
ability of counting n fermions in a given interval of time falls into precisely
the same general form. In the simplest instance, for detectors that respond
to the density rather than the ﬂux of the particles, the integral
takes the
form

I

= κ

ψ†(~r, t)ψ(~r, t)d3rdt,

(219)

I

Z

where the constant κ is a measure of the sensitivity of the counter and the
integration is carried out over the counting-time interval and over the volume
being observed.

To obtain the expectation value of the normally ordered exponential func-
tion in Eq.(218), then we may use the P-representation for the density opera-
tor ρ. In that case the ﬁeld operators ψ(~r, t) and ψ†(~r, t) are, in eﬀect, always
applied to their eigenstates, coherent states such as
. They can
then be replaced by their Grassmann ﬁeld eigenvalue functions deﬁned by
Eq.(180) and its adjoint, so that we have

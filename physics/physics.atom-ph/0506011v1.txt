The relativistic coupled-cluster theory has been employed to calculate the magnetic dipole and
electric quadrupole hyperﬁne structure constants for the stable isotopes 45Sc and 89Y. The role of
electron correlation is found to be very important. The trend exhibited by these eﬀects is rather
diﬀerent from previously studied single valence atomic systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

above interaction Hamiltonian yields

Electron correlation eﬀects play a crucial role in the ac-
curate determination of hyperﬁne struture constants [1].
We have calculated these constants for several atomic sys-
tems with single s valence electrons [2, 3] using the rela-
tivistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory which takes into ac-
count the interplay of relativistic and correlation eﬀects.
Our recent work on Pb+ which has a single p valence
electron [4] reveals the peculiar behaviour of the elec-
tron correlation eﬀects in the hyperﬁne constant of the
6p2P3/2 state. It would indeed be instructive to study
how electron correlation eﬀects inﬂuence systems with
single d valence electrons. In this paper we have carried
out ab initio calculation of the magnetic dipole (A) and
electric quadrupole (B) hyperﬁne structure constants for
stable Scandium (Sc) and Yttrium (Y) which have 3d
and 4d valence electrons respectively. Hyperﬁne struc-
ture constants for ground and ﬁrst excited states for these
two atoms have been measured using diﬀerent methods
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

III. METHOD OF CALCULATION :
RELATIVISTIC COUPLED CLUSTER THEORY

We have performed our calculations in the Dirac-
Coulomb (DC) approximation which embodies
the
dominant relativistic and correlation eﬀects. The Breit
interaction which is about two orders of magnitude
smaller than the Coulomb interaction has therefore
been omitted in the present case as the systems are
comparatively smaller in size.

The Dirac-Coulomb atomic Hamiltonian is given by

|φj (r)i =

1
r (cid:18)

Pj(r)|χκj mj i
Qj(r)|χ−κj mj i (cid:19)

,

where Pj(r) and Qj(r) are the radial part of the large
and small components respectively and |χκj mj i and
|χ−κj mj i are their respective spin angular momentum
components. ǫj’s are the single particle energies.

We have employed the RCC to incorporate correlation
eﬀects among electrons due to the residual Coulomb in-
teraction. In this approach the exact atomic wavefunc-
tion for the closed-shell system can be expressed as [1]

|ΨCCi = eT |Φi,

(3.4)

where T is the core electron excitation operator and
we call
|Φi is the
above closed-shell determinantal state built out of the
Dirac-Fock single particle orbitals.

H =

(3.1)

In the closed-shell coupled-cluster theory one starts

Xj

with the equation

1
rjl

,

Xj<l

where α and β are the usual Dirac matrices and Vnuc(rj )
is the potential at the site of the jth electron due to
the atomic nucleus. The rest mass energy of the elec-
tron is subtracted from the energy eigen values. We
ﬁrst solve the relativistic Hartree-Fock (Dirac-Fock (DF))
equations to obtain the single particle orbitals and their
energies,

HDF =

cα.pj + (β − 1)c2 + Vnuc(rj ) + Uj

Xj

. The residual Coulomb interaction is given by

The energy and amplitude determining equations are

HeT |Φi = EeT |Φi.

hΦK|H|Φi = Eδ0,K,

(3.5)

(3.6)

where H = e−T HeT ,
|ΦKi is a determinantal state
with K = 0,1,2.... representing the reference state and
excited determinantal states. We have considered all
possible non-linear terms in T- operator for its amplitude
determining equations.

(3.2)

Goldstone [1, 14, 15] and angular momentum diagram-
matic [1, 16] techniques are used for evaluating diﬀerent
radial integrals and angular factors. The normal ordered
Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

The single particle orbitals are obtained by solving the
following equation self-consistently

HN ≡ H − hΦ|H|Φi = H − EDF ,

(3.7)

(tj + Uj)|φj i = ǫj|φji,

(3.3)

where EDF = hΦ|H|Φi.

where

tj = cα · pj + (β − 1)c2 + Vnuc(rj)

We have truncated our wavefunction expansion at the
level of singles and doubles (CCSD) and all possible
non-linear terms have been included in the above
equation. First we evaluate wavefunction for the closed

3

shell system using the above RCC approach and then
append the corresponding valence electron using the
open shell RCC (OSCC) method [1, 17].

where ∆E(v) is the electron attachment energy which is
equal to the negative of the ionisation potential for the
valence electron v.

The new reference state of the open-shell system with

one valence electron v can be expressed as [17]

|Φvi ≡ a†

v|Φi,

(3.8)

where a†
v is the particle creation operator. The ex-
act atomic states are deﬁned now, using the Fock-space
OSCC method, as

|Ψvi = eT {eSv}|Φvi,

(3.9)

where Sv is the valence excitation operator and we call
it as open-shell RCC operator. Since systems under con-
sideration can be treated as with one valence electron,
the Sv- operator exponential series naturally truncates
at the linear term, i.e. the open-shell wavefunction has
the form

|Ψvi = eT {1 + Sv}|Φvi,

In the next step, we include approximate triple exci-
tations by contracting the two-body operator (Ves) and
the double excitation operators (T2, S2v) in the following
way [18]

The expectation value for a general one particle opera-
tor in a given valence electron (v) state can be expressed
in coupled-cluster theory as

(3.18)

and
nv = (eT †

eT )f.c. + (eT †

eT )o.b. + (eT †

eT )t.b. + ... (3.19)

The f.c., o.b., t.b.,..etc abbreviations are used for the
fully contracted, eﬀective one-body, eﬀective two-body
...etc terms respectively [2]. Terms containing only up to
eﬀective three-body diagrams will contribute to both the
numerator and the denominator. The fully contracted
terms are excluded on the basis of the linked-diagram
theorem [1] in the evaluation of the O and N . All the
one-body terms have been taken into account as their
contribution to the correlation eﬀects is the largest. The
dominant parts of the two-body terms have also been
computed [2]. Finally, these terms are contracted with
S†

v and Sv operators.

that we use notations a,b,c..., p,q,...

the core (occupied), particle (unoccupied) and general
orbitals respectively.

F (L/S)
(r) stands for the large (L) and small (S) compo-

nents of the Dirac wavefunction. c(L/S)
is the expansion
coeﬃcient of the corresponding large and small compo-

been imposed between the large and small components
of the GTOs. For the exponents, the even tempering
condition [21]

αi = αi−1β,

i = 1, · · · , N

(4.2)

has been applied. Here, N stands for the total number of
basis functions for a speciﬁc symmetry. All orbitals are
generated on a grid using a two-parameter Fermi nuclear
distribution approximation given by

ρ =

ρ0
1 + e(r−c)/a ,

(4.3)

where ρ0 is the average nuclear density, the parameter
’c’ is the half-charge radius, and ’a’ is related to the skin
thickness which is deﬁned as the interval of the nuclear
thickness which the nuclear charge density falls from

near one to near zero.

In the present calculation, we have used α◦ = 0.00525
and β = 2.73 for all symmetries in both the systems. We
have considered 35s1/2, 30p1/2, 30p3/2, 30d3/2, 30d5/2,
20f5/2 and 20f7/2 and 38s1/2, 35p1/2, 35p3/2, 35d3/2,
35d5/2, 20f5/2 and 20f7/2 GTOs to obtain Dirac-Fock
wavefunction in Sc and Y respectively. All core electrons
have been excited in the present calculations.

We have calculated both A and B constants for
3d2D3/2 and 3d2D5/2 states for Sc and 4d2D3/2 and
4d2D5/2 states for Y. We have used gI = 1.359 and
Q = 0.22 for Sc and gI = 0.3268 and Q = 0.125 for Y
respectively. All calculated results with corresponding
experimental results are presented in table I.

In table II and table III, we present contributions from
diﬀerent RCC terms for A and B values respectively. The
ﬁrst term O represents the DF value and is given in FIG.

the correlation between the core electros. OS1v (FIG.

tems with single s and p valence electrons. One of the
strengths of coupled-cluster theory is to account for such
intricate correlation eﬀects to all orders in the residual
Coulomb interaction. The two-body O and normaliza-
tion terms make non-negligible contributions.

V. CONCLUSION

We have performed calculations of the hyperﬁne con-
stants A and B for Sc and Y using RCC theory and
high lighted the importance of electron correlation. Our
results are in good agreement with experiments. This
indeed demonstrates the power of RCC theory to cap-
ture the interplay of relativistic and correlation eﬀects
for atomic systems with single d valence electrons.

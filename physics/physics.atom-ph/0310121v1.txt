We report a unique feature of magnetic ﬁeld Feshbach resonances in which atoms collide with non-
zero orbital angular momentum. P-wave (l = 1) Feshbach resonances are split into two components
depending on the magnitude of the resonant state’s projection of orbital angular momentum onto
the ﬁeld axis. This splitting is due to the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms and
it oﬀers a means to tune anisotropic interactions of an ultra-cold gas of atoms. A parameterization
of the resonance in terms of an eﬀective range expansion is given.

INTRODUCTION

The experimental observation of magnetic ﬁeld Fesh-
bach resonances (FRs) oﬀers a means by which to widely
tune the eﬀective interactions in degenerate quantum
gases. A Feshbach resonance occurs when a quasibound
state of two atoms becomes degenerate with the free
atoms and the interatomic potential either gains or loses
a bound state. As the quasibound state passes through
threshold the scattering length can be varied in princi-
ple from positive to negative inﬁnity. FRs were observed
in bosons [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], in fermions between distinct
spin states [6, 7, 8, 9], and in a single-component Fermi
gas [10]. Using FRs to study fermions oﬀers a means to
explore superﬂuid phase transitions [11, 12], three-body
recombination [13], mean-ﬁeld interactions [14, 15, 16]
and molecules [17, 18, 19, 20].

Of special interest is the p-wave FR observed in Ref.
[10], which exists in a single-component Fermi gas. Due
to the Pauli exclusion principle the two-body wave func-
tion must be anti-symmetric under interchange of two
fermions, implying that only odd partial waves l can exist
for identical fermions. For l = 1 the Wigner threshold law
dictates that the p-wave cross section scales as the tem-
perature squared. This characteristic behavior ordinar-
ily suppresses interactions at ultra-cold temperatures[21].
However, a resonance can dramatically increase the p-
wave cross section even at low temperatures.

In this article we discuss characteristics of p-wave Fes-
hbach resonances. The ﬁrst is a sensitive dependence of
observables on temperature and magnetic ﬁeld. This de-
pendence arises from a centrifugal barrier through which
the wave function must tunnel to access the resonant
state. Only in a narrow range of magnetic ﬁeld can the
continuum wave function be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
the bound state.

The second characteristic is a doublet in the resonance
feature arising from the magnetic dipole-dipole interac-
tion between the atoms’ valence electrons. The p-wave
FRs experience a non-vanishing dipole-dipole interaction
in lowest order, in contrast to s-wave FRs. This inter-
action splits the FR into distinct resonances based on
their partial wave projection onto the ﬁeld axis, ml = 0

ml|
|

= 1. Splitting of the p-wave resonance oﬀers a
or
means to tune the anisotropy of the interaction. Dipole-
dipole interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates and de-
generate Fermi gas have been considered due to the nov-
elty of the resulting strong anisotropic interaction [22].
P-wave FRs oﬀer an immediately accessible means to ex-
plore anisotropic interactions in the many-body physics
of degenerate gases.

tions presented here were performed using Johnson’s log-
derivative propagator method [23] in the magnetic ﬁeld
dressed hyperﬁne basis [24]. The potassium singlet and
triplet potentials [25, 26] are matched to long range dis-
persion potentials with C6 = 3927 a.u. and are ﬁne tuned
to yield the scattering lengths as = 104.0 a.u., at = 174
a.u. respectively. With these values we are able to re-
produce the FRs measured in Ref. [6, 10].

II. TEMPERATURE AND MAGNETIC FIELD
DEPENDENCE

A p-wave resonance is distinct from an s-wave (l = 0)
resonance in that the atoms must overcome a centrifu-
gal barrier to couple to the bound state. The extreme
dependence on magnetic ﬁeld and temperature can be
understood by considering the cross section as a function
of energy at several values of magnetic ﬁeld, as shown
in Fig. 1 (a). The lowest curve, with a magnetic ﬁeld
B=190 G, shows typical oﬀ-resonance p-wave threshold
behavior. Once the magnetic ﬁeld is increased to be close
to the resonance, the cross section changes signiﬁcantly,
and a narrow resonance appears at low energy. The res-
onance ﬁrst appears for ﬁelds just above B=198.8 G. As
the magnetic ﬁeld is increased the resonance broadens
and moves to higher energy. The p-wave resonance’s nar-
rowness is due the fact that atoms must tunnel through
a centrifugal barrier before they can interact.

This narrow resonance structure is in stark contrast to

the s-wave FR shown in Fig. 1 (b), which occurs between
the spin states
, as reported

|
[6]. The energy dependence of the s-wave FR
in Ref.
has a much simpler form than the p-wave FR. At high
energy the cross section is essentially at the unitarity
limit, which is shown as the solid line. At lower energy
the cross section plateaus at a constant value of 4πa2,
where a is the s-wave scattering length. The energy at
which the cross section plateaus depends on the magnetic
ﬁeld. The closer to resonance the magnetic ﬁeld is tuned,
the lower the energy at which the cross section plateaus.
The temperature dependence of p-wave FRs results
from the strong energy dependence of the cross section.
For a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the atomic en-
ergies, the thermally averaged cross section is

where k is Boltzmann’s constant and σ(E) is the energy
dependent cross section [24].

Figure 2 shows the thermally averaged cross section
for the ml = 1 p-wave resonance, Fig. 2 (a), and for
the s-wave FR, Fig. 2 (b). The key features of Figure
2 (a) are the sudden rise of the cross section and ther-
mal broadening, which grows dramatically at high ﬁeld
as the temperature increases. The rise comes from the
sudden appearance of the the narrow resonance at posi-
tive collision energies as the magnetic ﬁeld is tuned. This
rise is not temperature dependent because, regardless of
temperature, the threshold is ﬁrst degenerate with the
bound state at a unique magnetic ﬁeld. By contrast, the
high ﬁeld tail of the resonance is sensitive to temperature
because once the bound state has passed through thresh-
old the energy dependent cross section peaks at higher
energies for higher ﬁeld values. For a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld
the high ﬁeld side of the FR, there is a well deﬁned, nar-
row resonance at a particular energy (Fig. 1 (a)). If the
temperature is low, very few atom pairs can access this
resonance. At higher temperatures more atoms experi-
ence resonant scattering, increasing

This characteristic asymmetric proﬁle is not present is
s-wave FRs. The s-wave FR is shown in Fig. 2 (b) near
its peak. The only eﬀect of temperature in the elastic
cross section is to wash out the peak of the resonance
as the temperature is increased. This behavior follows
from the relatively structureless energy-dependent cross
section in Fig. 1 (b).

This term in the Hamiltonian couples diﬀerent partial

projections ml for l′ = l

s-wave scattering (l = l′ = 0) equation (4) vanishes by
symmetry. This term only plays a role in s-wave scat-
d wave transitions. However for p-wave

The diﬀerence between the ml projections can be un-
derstood intuitively by considering the dipole-dipole in-
teraction of the two atoms. For the
spin
states case the electronic spins are essentially aligned
with the ﬁeld. When two dipoles are aligned head to tail
they are in an attractive conﬁguration, corresponding to
ˆR
ˆsi = 1 in Eq. (2). Vice-versa when the dipoles are side
by side they are in a repulsive conﬁguration, ˆR
ˆsi = 0.
Viewing the motion of the atoms in the resonant state
as classical, circular orbits, the cases ml = 0 and ml = 1
are distinguished as in Figure 3. For ml = 0, in Fig.
3 (a), the motion of the atoms is in a plane containing
the magnetic ﬁeld. Classically this corresponds to mo-
tion described by the angle θ, where the magnetic ﬁeld
lies in the ˆz direction. The interaction for ml = 0 al-
ternates between attractive and repulsive as the dipoles
change between head to tail attraction and side by side
repulsion. On the other hand, for
= 1, shown in Fig.
3 (b), the motion of the atoms is in the plane perpendic-
ular to the magnetic ﬁeld. Classically this corresponds

ml|
|

·

to motion described by the angle φ. This interaction is
only repulsive, because the dipoles are held in the side-
by-side conﬁguration. Since the dipole-dipole interaction
for
= 1 has only a repulsive inﬂuence it forms a
resonant state with higher energy.

Figure 4 shows the total elastic cross section as a func-
tion of ﬁeld at several temperatures. One can clearly
see the doublet feature in the cross section at low tem-
perature. The ﬁrst peak corresponds to
= 1. The
doublet cannot be resolved at high temperature because
the width of the resonance is wider than the splitting.

The energy shift can be estimated using perturbation
theory. The energy shift due to the dipole-dipole inter-
action is given in perturbation theory as

is the molecular state that couples to the continuum cre-
ating the FR. We notice that the perturbation is the
same for each component, except for the angular coef-
ﬁcients in Equations (5) and (6). When these equations
are evaluated, we ﬁnd that the energy diﬀerence in the
molecules,

to the closed coupling calculation result of 4.7µK. As the
bound states are brought through threshold, we ﬁnd that
their energy diﬀerence translates into a peak separation
of 0.5 G, determined from the closed coupling scattering
calculations.

Experimentally we have observed the doublet p-wave
resonance in an ultra-cold gas of 40K through inelastic
collisional eﬀects. A gas of atoms in the
state
of 40K was prepared at T=0.34 µK in an optical dipole
trap characterized by a radial frequency of νr=430 Hz
and an axial frequency of νz=7 Hz [6, 10]. The gas was
then held at a magnetic ﬁeld near resonance for 260 µs.
The resulting Gaussian size of the trapped gas in the
axial direction was measured as a function of magnetic
ﬁeld. The result of this measurement is shown in Fig. 5.
The observed heating of the gas in Figure 5 is due
to inelastic processes that occur at the p-wave FR. The
result clearly shows the predicted doublet structure. The
8
splitting between the two peaks is measured to be 0.47
±
G, in good agreement with the theory. The dominant
inelastic processes are 3-body losses [10, 13], which lie at
a slightly lower ﬁeld than the elastic resonance peak [10].

IV. EFFECTIVE RANGE EXPANSION OF THE
P-WAVE FR

To compute many-body properties of degenerate gases
the s-wave scattering length is often used to mimic the
essential 2-body physics. Near a FR the scattering length
diverges and can be represented well by a = abg(1

−

3

∆

B−B0 ) where abg is the back ground scattering length, ∆
is the width, B0 is the location of the s-wave resonance.
Scattering length is deﬁned as a =lim
tan(δ0)/k where
k→0
δ0 is the s-wave phase shift and k = √2µE where µ is
the reduced mass.

−

−

For p-wave collisions the relevant quantity is the scat-
tan(δ1)/k3. A simple form like
tering volume, v =lim
k→0
the one for a is inadequate for parameterization of the
p-wave scattering volume because the p-wave resonance
has a complicated energy dependence. Fig. 6(a) shows
the p-wave scattering volume as a function of ﬁeld and
energy. The curves show that as the energy is increased
the location and width of the resonance change.

To adequately parameterize the p-wave phase shift
across the resonance one must use the second order term
in the the eﬀective range expansion [28]. Fig. 6(b) shows
k3 cot(δ1) plotted as a function of energy for several mag-
netic ﬁelds. This set of curves can then be ﬁt using ef-
fective range expansion of the form

Where δ1 is the p-wave phase shift, v is the scattering
volume, and c the second coeﬃcient in the expansion,
analogous to the eﬀective range in the s-wave expansion,
but with units a−1
0 . Both v and c are functions of mag-
netic ﬁeld. Fitting v and c to quadratic functions of B,
which is adequate for the energy range of E < 10−6 K
and magnetic ﬁeld range of 195 to 205 gauss, we ﬁnd

ing parameters.

IMPLICATIONS FOR EXPERIMENTS

Because of the p-wave FR, angular dependence of scat-
tering is under the experimenter’s control. For example
if magnetic ﬁeld tuned to 199.0 G in the 40K p-wave
FR the dominant interactions in the gas will be perpen-
dicular to the ﬁeld axis, which follows from the angu-
lar distribution corresponding to the spherical harmonic
Y11(θ, φ) leading to enhanced collisions rates away from
the ﬁeld axis. Whereas if the ﬁeld is tuned 0.5 G higher,

TABLE I: Predicted p-wave resonances in bosonic Rb and
a Bose-Fermi mixture of Rb-K. The Rb p-wave FRs gain a
bound state as the ﬁeld is increased, whereas the opposite
is true for 40K p-wave FR. This is why in Rb the ml = 0
resonance is lower in ﬁeld.

B|ml|=1 = 540.3 ± 30 G

at cold temperatures the interaction will be dominated
by Y10(θ, φ), characterized by enhanced collisions along
the ﬁeld axis. The angular dependence of the collisions
also has implications for the inelastic 2-body processes.
These processes are characterized by two atoms gaining
a predictable amount of energy governed by hyperﬁne
splitting and are redistributed in a well deﬁned angular
manner.

P-wave FRs oﬀer a means to experimentally study
anisotropic interactions in systems other than identical
fermions. For example, we predict that there are p-wave
FRs in distinct spin states of bosonic 85Rb and in the
Bose-Fermi mixture of 87Rb-40K, shown in Table I. The
Rb calculations used potentials that are consistent with
[29]. The Rb-K calculations are consistent with
Ref.

4

Ref.
[30]. On resonance the p-wave cross section be-
comes comparable to the background s-wave scattering.
This means that it could have an equally important role
in determining the collisional behavior and mean-ﬁeld in-
teraction of a thermal gas or condensate.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have presented characteristics of p-wave FRs. An
interesting characteristic is the doublet feature for the
FR with l = 1. The splitting is caused by the dipole-
dipole interaction having distinct values depending on
partial wave projection. This might in turn oﬀer a means
to study anisotropic interactions in quantum gases. An-
other feature of the p-wave FR is the asymmetric thermal
broadening, which arises from the resonant state moving
away from threshold as the magnetic ﬁeld is tuned. Gen-
erally, we expect the broadening to occur for ﬁelds which
the v < 0. Just as a p-wave FR splits into two compo-
nents an l-wave FR will split into l + 1 components.

energy for |9/2, −9/2i|9/2, −7/2i|0, 0i collisions for diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁeld values. The s-wave FR peaks at B=201.6 G.
Compared to the p-wave FR these have little structure. The
solid line is the unitarity limit.

(a) Thermally averaged cross
|9/2, −7/2i|9/2, −7/2i|1, 1i collisions as a function of mag-
netic ﬁeld. The striking features of this curve are the
sudden rise and change in width as
the temperature
is increased.
(b) Thermally averaged cross section for
|9/2, −9/2i|9/2, −7/2i|0, 0i collisions as a function of mag-
netic ﬁeld. The temperature dependence is only evident at
the peak where it washes out the maximum value.

FIG. 3: Schematic representation of classical dipoles interact-
ing in diﬀerent circular orbits. Shown in (a) is an orbit with
ml = 0, which is in a plane containing the magnetic ﬁeld.
Here the dipoles sometimes attract and sometimes repel. In
(b) is shown an orbit with |ml| = 1, in a plane perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld. Here the atoms predominately repel
one another.

FIG. 4: The thermally averaged elastic cross section for the p-
wave FR, including all partial wave projections ml = −1, 0, 1.
At low temperatures, the doublet splitting emerges clearly,
but it is washed out a higher temperatures due to thermal
broadening. The lower ﬁeld resonance has |ml| = 1 and the
higher ﬁeld resonance has ml = 0.

that both the location at which the scattering volume diverges
and the width vary with collision energy. (b) k3 cot(δ1) for

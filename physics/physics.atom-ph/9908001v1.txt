In a recent paper Robicheaux and Shaw [Phys. Rev. A 58,
1043 (1998)] calculate the recurrence spectra of atoms in elec-
tric ﬁelds with non-vanishing angular momentum hLzi 6= 0.
Features are observed at scaled actions “an order of magni-
tude shorter than for any classical closed orbit of this system.”
We investigate the transition from zero to nonzero angular
momentum and demonstrate the existence of short closed or-
bits with Lz 6= 0. The real and complex “ghost” orbits are
created in bifurcations of the “uphill” and “downhill” orbit
along the electric ﬁeld axis, and can serve to interpret the
observed features in the quantum recurrence spectra.

In Ref. [1] Robicheaux and Shaw calculate quantum
photoabsorption spectra of atoms in electric ﬁelds with
= 0 and observe
nonzero magnetic quantum numbers, m
recurrence peaks at short actions in the Fourier transform
recurrence spectra. For spectra with magnetic quantum
number m = 0 these peaks can be directly interpreted
as the recurrences of the “uphill” and “downhill” orbit
along the electric ﬁeld axis. For nonzero angular mo-
menta the authors argue that “these two orbits are not
possible, because Lz is conserved and there is a repul-
z/(x2 + y2) term in the potential.” The observed
sive L2
features at short actions are therefore interpreted as “re-
currences without closed orbits.” It is the purpose of this
comment to demonstrate that the uphill and downhill or-
bit do not disappear to nowhere at the transition from
zero to nonzero angular momentum Lz, but, by contrast,
closed orbits with approximately the same short action
= 0. As will be shown, the orbits along
still exist for Lz 6
the z axis undergo bifurcations and split into a real and
a complex “ghost” orbit. The importance of ghost orbits
for the photoabsorption spectra of atoms in a magnetic
ﬁeld has been discussed at length in [2].

The two solutions represent a real and a ghost orbit for
ν0 real and imaginary, respectively. With given ν0 it is a
straightforward task to calculate the constant of motion
Z1 = 1
Z2 and to solve for µ(τ ) in Eq. 1. The shapes
of the closed orbits are presented in dimensionless scaled
coordinates (˜ρ = ρF 1/2, ˜z = zF 1/2) in Fig. 1 for ε =

and scaled angular momentum ˜Lz = 0.014, which belongs
to the magnetic quantum number m = 1 at a value ω =
2πpε/E = 450. This corresponds to the values chosen in
Figure 1 of Ref. [1]. The solid line is the real orbit, which
is the uphill orbit distorted by the repulsive centrifugal
barrier. An analogous orbit has been discovered and

discussed for the diamagnetic Kepler system with non-
vanishing angular momentum [3]. The dashed and dash-
dotted lines are the real and imaginary part of the com-
plex ghost orbit, respectively. The real part of the ghost
orbit is nearly identical with the uphill orbit at vanishing
angular momentum ˜Lz = 0. The scaled action of both
orbits is ˜S
2ε = 0.35 in perfect agreement with
the ﬁrst recurrence peak in Figures 2 and 3 of Ref. [1].

As mentioned above, for Lz 6

= 0 the centrifugal bar-
rier does not allow trajectories to start exactly at the
origin. The nearest distance of closed orbits from the
origin depends on the values of the constants of motion

0.5 and increases when Z1 or
Z2 approaches the minimal allowed value. For the real
closed orbit in Fig. 1 the nearest distance from the ori-
gin is ˜rmin = rminF 1/2 = 0.0025 in scaled units, which
is about 13 Bohr radii at ω = 2πpε/E = 450. This is
slightly outside the classically allowed region of the ini-
, however, it should be noted that a small
tial state
i
change of the initial conditions results in approximately
closed orbits where the distance to the origin at the start
and return is reduced to about a few Bohr radii. The real
closed orbit in Fig. 1 is more strongly excited in dipole
transitions from initial states of larger size than the size
of the hydrogenic
state as can clearly be seen in
Figs. 5 and 6 of Ref. [1] for the excitation of the K and
Cs atom, respectively. The relatively large nearest dis-
tance of the closed orbit to the origin suppresses eﬀects of
classical core scattering [4], especially for the K atom (see
Fig. 5 in Ref. [1]), which might result in strong damping
of the multiple repetitions for orbits with Lz = 0 diving
deeply into the ionic core. For the Cs atom the ionic core
has larger size and core scattering can be observed in Fig.
6 of Ref. [1], but, in contrast to the interpretation given
in [1], orbits are scattered into the truly existing short
closed orbit presented in Fig. 1. However, it is still an
outstanding task to reproduce quantitatively the ampli-
tudes of recurrence peaks in the Fourier transform quan-
tum spectra of the hydrogen atom and non-hydrogenic
atoms by application of closed orbit theory. Robicheaux
and Shaw are probably right that the theory may need
to be generalized to account for the eﬀects of orbits not
starting at and returning back exactly to the origin.

In conclusion, we have investigated the bifurcation sce-
nario of the shortest closed orbits of the hydrogen atom
in an electric ﬁeld at the transition from zero to non-
vanishing angular momentum Lz, and revealed the exis-
= 0.
tence of short real and complex ghost orbits with Lz 6
They are born in bifurcations of the uphill and downhill
orbit along the ﬁeld axis and can serve to interpret fea-
tures at short scaled actions in the quantum recurrence
spectra calculated by Robicheaux and Shaw [1].

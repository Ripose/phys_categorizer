Abstract

The universal three-body dynamics in ultra-cold binary Fermi and Fermi-Bose mixtures is stud-

ied. Two identical fermions of the mass m and a particle of the mass m1 with the zero-range

two-body interaction in the states of the total angular momentum L = 1 are considered. Using

the boundary condition model for the s-wave interaction of diﬀerent particles, both eigenvalue

and scattering problems are treated by solving hyper-radial equations, whose terms are derived

analytically. The dependencies of the three-body binding energies on the mass ratio m/m1 for the

positive two-body scattering length are calculated; it is shown that the ground and excited states

λ2 ≈
arise at m/m1 ≥
m/m1 . λ2, the relevant bound states turn to narrow resonances, whose positions and widths are

12.91743, respectively. For m/m1 . λ1 and

8.17260 and m/m1 ≥

λ1 ≈

calculated. The 2 + 1 elastic scattering and the three-body recombination near the three-body

threshold are studied and it is shown that a two-hump structure in the mass-ratio dependencies of

the cross sections is connected with arising of the bound states.

INTRODUCTION

In the last years, investigations of multi-component ultra-cold quantum gases have at-

tracted much interest. Properties of binary Fermi-Bose [1, 2] and Fermi [3, 4, 5] mixtures

and of impurities embedded in a quantum gas [6, 7]) are under experimental and theoretical

study. Diﬀerent aspects of the few-body dynamics of two-species compounds are of interest

both from the general point of view and for many-body applications. For example, there

are an inﬁnite number of three-body bound states of two-component fermions (Eﬁmov ef-

fect) if their mass ratio exceeds the critical value [8]. Recently, an inﬁnite number of 1+

bound states has been predicted [9] for three identical fermions with the resonant p-wave

interaction. More detailed study of the energy spectrum of three two-component particles

is of interest to shed light on the role of trimer molecules in the many-body dynamics and

provides an insight into the few-body processes. Concerning the low-energy scattering, one

of the interesting features is a two-hump structure in the isotopic dependence of the three-

body recombination rate of two-component fermions [10, 11]. Note that the low-energy

three-body recombination rate of two-component fermions scales as the ﬁrst power of the

collision energy and the sixth power of the two-body scattering length [10, 12].

The aim of the present paper is to study the three-body energy spectrum and the low-

energy (2 + 1)-scattering for two identical fermions of mass m and the third diﬀerent particle

of mass m1. Here one considers the unit total angular momentum L = 1 and the s-wave

interaction between diﬀerent particles, which is most important for description of the low-

energy processes. Note that the s-wave interaction takes place only in binary mixtures,

whereas only the p-wave interaction is possible in a one-component Fermi gas. The de-

scription of the three-body properties turns out to be universal and depending on a single

parameter m/m1 in the limit of the zero interaction range. For the interaction given within

the framework of the boundary condition model (BCM), solution of hyper-radial equations

(HREs) provides an eﬃcient approach to treat both the eigenvalue and the scattering prob-

lem [13, 14, 15]. An important advantage of the BCM is that all the terms of HREs are

derived in the analytical form; the method of derivation and the analytical expressions are

similar to those obtained for three identical bosons in 3 and 2 dimensions [13, 16]. The cal-

culations reveal that two three-body bound states arise while the mass ratio m/m1 increases

from zero to the critical λc, beyond which the number of bound states becomes inﬁnite [8].

2

A two-hump structure is found for the mass-ratio dependencies of the elastic and inelastic (2

+ 1)-scattering cross sections near the three-body threshold. The structure of the isotopic

dependencies is qualitatively related to arising of the bound states as a common origin is an

increase of the potential-well depth in the 2 + 1 channel.

II. OUTLINE OF THE APPROACH

In the universal low-energy limit, the short-range two-body interaction is described by a

single parameter, a natural choice for which is the two-body scattering length a. For the

vanishing range of interaction, the two-body interaction is deﬁned within the framework of

the BCM by imposing the boundary condition at the zero inter-particle distance r

The two-body interaction introduced in this way is known in the literature as the zero-range

potential [17], the Fermi pseudo-potential [18], the Fermi-Huang pseudo-potential [19, 20],

and an equivalent approach is used in the momentum-space representation [21].

For deﬁniteness, one supposes that particle 1 is of mass m1 and particles 2 and 3 are two

identical fermions of mass m. The wave function Ψ satisﬁes the equation

[∆x + ∆y + E] Ψ = 0 ,

The total interaction is expressed by imposing two boundary conditions of the form (1) at

zero distances between the diﬀerent particles in two pairs 1

the wave function should be antisymmetric under permutation of identical fermions 2 and

The three-body bound and resonance states and the low-energy scattering are conve-

niently treated by solving a system of HREs [22]. The eigenfunctions Φn(ρ, Ω) are deﬁned

variable ρ at various mass ratios m/m1 given by the parameter ω. Diﬀerent branches of this

unique function for the real-valued ρ form a set of real-valued eigenvalues γ2

n(ρ); thus, the

solution of the eigenvalue problem is accomplished by means of expressions (12) and (13).

An advantage of the BCM is that the eigenvalues γ2

n(ρ) entering into HREs are expressed

in a simple analytical form [14, 15, 16], which is helpful both for qualitative analysis and

in the numerical calculations. Moreover, the coupling terms Qnm(ρ) and Pnm(ρ) can be

determined in the analytical form via γ2

n(ρ) and their derivatives as was done in [13, 16]; the

derivation is outlined in the Appendix.

the critical value, m/m1 > λc, was ﬁrst discovered in Ref. [8]. Note that the unambiguous

description of the three-body properties for m/m1 > λc requires an additional parameter

which determines the wave function in the vicinity of the triple-collision point.

function f1(ρ) acquires additional oscillations as the potential-well depth increases, which

leads to an oscillating mass-ratio dependence of both elastic and inelastic scattering ampli-

tudes. On the other hand, arising of the three-body bound states with increasing m/m1 is

connected with occurrence of oscillations of f1(ρ) within the potential-well range. In this

respect, one can mention an analogy with Levinson’s theorem, which links the number of

the bound states to the threshold-energy phase shift.

V. DISCUSSION

The universal low-energy description for two identical fermions interacting with the third

diﬀerent particle in the states of the total angular momentum L = 1 is given within the

framework of the approach based on the solution of hyper-radial equations, whose terms are

derived in the analytical form. It is found that there are no three-body bound-states for
the negative scattering length and m/m1 ≤
there are exactly zero, one and two bound states for m/m1 < λ1, λ1 ≤

The above-described universal picture should be observed in the limit

if the potential is tuned to produce the loosely bound two-body state. In this limit, one

expects to observe simultaneously the loosely bound two-body and three-body states, whose
binding energies scale as a−2 and their ratio depends on m/m1. Similar threshold behaviour

of the binding energies was discussed in [16, 23, 24] for three two-dimensional bosons.

Both the elastic (2 + 1)-scattering cross sections and the three-body recombination rate

near the three-body threshold manifest a two-hump structure of their mass-ratio dependen-
cies for m/m1 ≤

channel; in this respect, the interference is connected with arising of two three-body bound

states with increasing m/m1.

As the present paper describes the universal three-body properties in the idealized limit

of the zero interaction range, it is of interest to discuss brieﬂy the eﬀect of the ﬁnite, though

isotopes. For the mixtures of 87Sr with 7Li, the mass ratio m/m1 ≈
12.4 > λ1, which entails
existence of the trimer bosonic molecule 7Li 87Sr2, whose binding energy is about 0.793 times
the binding energy of the dimer molecule 7Li 87Sr. For the mixtures of 87Sr with 6Li, the

mass ratio m/m1 = 14.5 slightly exceeds the critical value λc, which entails existence of the
trimer fermionic molecule 6Li 87Sr2 in two states, whose binding energies are slightly above
4.895 and 0.138 times the binding energy of the dimer molecule 6Li 87Sr.

APPENDIX A: ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR THE COUPLING TERMS

Although the direct calculation of the coupling terms Qnm(R) and Pnm(R) via the def-

inition (7) is quite involved, one can circumvent this problem and obtain the analytical

expressions for Qnm(ρ) and Pnm(ρ) via γ2

n(ρ) and their derivatives by using the explicit de-

pendence on ρ in the boundary condition (4). Similar analytical expressions were derived

for a number of problems based on the BCM; more details are given in [16].

Hereafter one concisely writes the eigenvalue problem (3), (4) as

given by the permutational symmetry. Here the integration volume is arbitrarily chosen to

provide the unit coeﬃcient for the last term in (A5) and it is taken into account that equal

contributions come from two surface integrals around both singularities. The diagonal part

of Eq. (A5) gives the basic relation

which allows one to derive the desired expressions via the derivative of the eigenvalues γ2

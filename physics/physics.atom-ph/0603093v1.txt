Fermi Gases

(Dated: July 24, 2013)

Abstract

The ground state energy and pairing gap of the interacting Fermi gases calculated by the ab initio

stochastic method are compared with those estimated from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer pairing

Hamiltonian. We discuss the ingredients of this Hamiltonian in various regimes of interaction

strength. In the weakly interacting (1/akF << 0) regime the BCS Hamiltonian should describe

Landau quasi-particle energies and interactions, on the other hand in the strongly pairing regime,

that is 1/akF >

∼ 0, it becomes part of the bare Hamiltonian. However, the bare BCS Hamiltonian

is not adequate for describing atomic gases in the regime of weak to moderate interaction strength

−∞ < 1/akF < 0 such as akF ∼ −1.

The superﬂuid state of alkali fermion gases such as 6Li, 40K is analogous to the super-

conducting state found in the electronic systems [1] and it has been studied theoretically

[2] and experimentally [3]. Recent experimental progress includes the detection of the Bose

Einstein Condensate (BEC) state of the bound Fermi pairs [4, 5, 6, 7] as an evidence of the

predicted BCS-BEC crossover.

The interaction among 6Li atoms can be attractive and requires preparation of the atoms

in diﬀerent internal quantum states |1i and |2i. The Feshbach resonance [8, 9, 10] between

the atoms in these states can modify the characteristics of the collision. We assume that the

partial densities of the atomic species are the same and the temperature is low (T ≈ 0). The

interactions can be characterized by the s-wave scattering length a which can be tuned by

the externally applied magnetic ﬁeld. The Hamiltonian of the interacting atomic fermions

can be written in the conﬁguration space as

Hbare = −

where the index i is for species |1i particles while i′ is for species |2i particles.

with a†

The BCS approach is to restrict the interaction to the time-reversed pair (k,−k) of diﬀerent

and

species.

Ground states of Hamiltonian (Eq 1) have been obtained using the stochastic method

known as Green’s Function Monte Carlo (GFMC) [11, 12] where variational degrees

of freedom were introduced to deal with the fermion sign problem. Their energies are

considered as close upper bounds to those of the exact ground state. In the Ref [11, 12], a

ﬁnite short range cosh-function potential rather than δ-function potential was used. The
range of the potential is ∼ 1
6 r0 where r0 is the unit radius ( 4

Variational) it appears that this ﬁnite range potential is a good approximation for the zero

range potential in the 1/akF < 0 regime (see Fig 1).

The original BCS technique was to use HLandau

(Eq 5) and solve it variationally using

BCS

ΨBCS. The solution will give the superﬂuid energy ES = EN + EP , where the pairing energy

In this case we can get ES = EN + EP = ELenz + EP (see Fig 2). This projection of the

bare Hamiltonian into the Landau Hamiltonian is useful only in the weak interaction limit

in which ELenz − EF G has most of the interaction eﬀect and |Ep| << |ELenz − EF G| as seen

in the Fig 2.

On the other hand, Leggett [15, 16] solved the Hbare

BCS (Eq 4) with the condition that

the density remains constant with the chemical potential µc adjusted accordingly. This

of ﬁrst and second order of akF with BCS-Leggett and GFMC results both from the

bare potential. The Lenz expansion is considered exact in the low density regime for

the interacting Fermi gas in normal phase. From Fig 2, it is obvious that the expansion

diverges for 1/akF > −1 . ES = ELenz + EP has good match with the GFMC results in the

regime 1/akF

<
∼ −1. Here the eﬀect of pairing is small in EGF M C (the diﬀerence between
the Slater node and BCS node solutions lies within the statistical uncertainties) thus

|Ep| << |ELenz − EF G| is a reasonable assumption although ∆ is clearly non zero. In this

regime we notice that EBCS−Leggett is distinguishably higher than EGF M C and energies of the

normal phase low density expansion. At akF = −1, ∆E = EBCS−Leggett−EGF M C = 0.19EF G

6

(see Table I). This is a consequence of having the anomalous density ukvk small and

µc ≈ EF .

In fact, when ukvk ≈ 0 the ΨBCS → ΨF G. However, we can see that the

usual Hartree-Fock term for the normal phase is missing (Eq 13) in the energy expres-

sion from the pairing Hamiltonian. Thus we have EBCS−Leggett much higher even than ELenz.

We interpret this as a consequence of using pairing Hamiltonian instead of the full bare

interaction Hamiltonian. The pairing Hamiltonian becomes a poor model for the atomic

gas in the interacting regime with −∞ < 1/akF < 0, in particular around the moderate

interaction strength akF ∼ −1. This is in sharp contrast to the context in which the

original Landau-BCS formalism was introduced that was the weak coupling approximation
in a broad range −∞ ≤ 1/akF <

∼ −1. EGF M C, EBCS−Leggett, and ELenz + EP converge in
the akF ≈ 0 regime, that is the trivial free Fermi gas limit, where the Hartree-Fock term

becomes eﬀectively zero.

On the other hand, the time reversed pairing (k,-k) assumption becomes less relevant

once the interaction is strong enough for the particles to form loosely bound pairs in the sea

of many fermions. This can be seen as ∆E becomes smaller (= 0.15EF G) in the strongly
interacting regime 1/akF = 0 and 1/akF = +0.1. In the 1/akF ≥ 0. ˙3 region, EBCS−Leggett

and EGF M C apparently reverse back to the diverging behavior (Fig 1). But as shown in the

comparison of the LOCV energies, the range of the model potential becomes inadequate
to approximate the δ-potential as the size of the bound pairs become <

∼ r0 and ∼ R. We
argue that the actual EGF M C with short range potential would lie closer to EBCS−Leggett

than the current ﬁnite range calculation shows. The bound fermions condense in the k = 0

state. Thus Hbare

atom (Eq 2) → Hbare

BCS (Eq 4) and results of two models should match.

As for the pairing gap, both BCS-Leggett and GFMC results seem to be in rea-

sonable agreement in the whole 1/akF < 0 region considering that statistical errors of

∆GF M C ∼ 10%. The reasonable match of ∆ while a poorer match for E/N is not surprising

given the fact that the chemical potential µc is greatly modiﬁed in this region. µc goes

In conclusion, we have tested the regimes of validity of the BCS pairing Hamiltonian

in the study of fermion particles interacting with bare short-range two-body potential.

We notice that the pairing assumption is generally not valid when bare potential is used

in a broad range of the weakly interacting regime −∞ < 1/akF < 0, while the original

quasi-particle BCS formalism was introduced to describe the superﬂuid precisely in this

region.We notice considerable discrepancy in the energy, however the gap is predicted

with reasonable accuracy at akF ≈ −1. Pairing correlation is less relevant in the trivial

(free Fermi gas) and the tightly bound pair (1/akF > 0) limits. In fact, it can be shown

that GFMC calculations with both Slater and pairing nodes converge to the same value

(molecular energy per particle Emol/2) in the extreme of this limit. This work has been

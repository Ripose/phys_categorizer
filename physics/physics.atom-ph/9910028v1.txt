Nonlinear relativistic ionization phenomena induced by a strong linearly polarized laser ﬁeld
are considered. The starting point is the classical relativistic action for a free electron moving in
the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by a strong laser beam. This action has been used to calculate
semiclassical transition rates. Simple analytical expressions for the ionization rate, the photoelectron
emission velocity and for the drift momentum distribution of the photoelectron have been found.
The analytical formulas apply to nonrelativistic bound systems as well as to initial states with an
energy corresponding to the upper boundary of the lower continuum and to the tunnel as well as the
multiphoton regime. In the case of a nonrelativistic bound system we recover the Keldysh formula
for the ionization rate. Relativistic eﬀects in the initial state lead to a weak enhancement of the
rate of sub-barrier ionization and to the appearance of a nonzero photoelectron leaving velocity.

I. INTRODUCTION

Relativistic ionization phenomena induced by strong laser light has become a topic of current interest [1–7]. In the
nonrelativistic theory it is assumed that the electron velocity in the initial bound state as well as in the ﬁnal state is
small compared with the speed of light. However, the electrons may be accelerated up to relativistic velocities in an
intense electromagnetic ﬁeld produced by modern laser devices. If the ponderomotive energy of the electron is of the
order of the rest energy a relativistic consideration is required. Relativistic eﬀects in the ﬁnal states become important
for an infrared laser at intensities of some 1016W cm−2. The minimal intensity required for relativistic eﬀects increases
by two orders of magnitude for wavelength corresponding to visible light. The main relativistic eﬀects in the ﬁnal
state are [1,4–7]: (i) the relativistic energy distribution and (ii) the shift of the angular distribution of the emitted
electrons towards the direction of propagation of incident laser beam. Relativistic eﬀects have also to be taken into
account if the binding energy Eb in the initial state is comparable with the electron rest energy [2]. A relativistic
formulation is necessary for the ionization of heavy atoms or singly or multiply charged ions from the inner shells.

This paper is aimed to consider the relativistic eﬀects connected with relativistic ﬁnal states velocities and/or low

lying initial states from a unique point of view.

Let us start with the classical relativistic action for an electron of charge e moving in the ﬁeld of an electromagnetic
x/c). Here and below A denotes a two-dimensional vector in the y-z plane.

Hamilton-Jacobi method we take the derivative of the action Sf with respect to the constants a1, a2 and α and set
the result equal to new constants β1, β2 and β3 in order to obtain the electron trajectory under the inﬂuence of the
wave ﬁeld. Assuming a harmonic plane wave of linear polarization with the electric ﬁeld E = F ey cos ωξ we obtain
that the electron motion in the ﬁeld and in the laboratory coordinate system is given by

Consider now the process of nonlinear ionization of a strongly bound electron with a binding energy Eb comparable
with the rest energy. Recently the ionization process in static crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds has been considered
[2,3]. The results of this paper may be applied to the ionization in laser ﬁelds only for the case of very strong ﬁelds
1. With an increasing frequency of the laser light (especially for a tentative x-ray laser) very high laser intensities
ǫ
are required to satisfy this condition. Therefore it is necessary to generalize the result of [2,3] to the case of nonzero
frequencies. We consider the sub-barrier ionization. The condition to be satisﬁed is the opposite to the case of pure
classical ionization, F
Eb. No restrictions are applied
FB, in addition we have the quasiclassical condition ¯hω
to the parameter ǫ. Thus we will cover both the regime of relativistic tunnel and multiphoton ionization.

The minimization of the imaginary part of the action leads to the following boundary conditions [11]

Im (x, r)(t = 0) = 0 .

In order to obtain simple analytical results we consider the case of linearly polarized laser light. Then by minimizing
the action we obtain from Eqs. (4) and (5) that f = 0. Further we obtain a system of nonlinear equations for the
determination of complex initial time t0 and constant α,

Here the ﬁrst two terms in the brackets describe the familiar nonrelativistic ionization rate including the ﬁrst frequency

the pair creation from the vacuum. It is known that there a no nonlinear vacuum phenomena for a plane wave [13].
In contrast to that we deal here with the ionization of an atom being in rest in the laboratory system of coordinates.
We also mention that we employ the single particle picture. Therefore the pair production processes are beyond the
scope of the present paper.

Again the ﬁrst two terms in the brackets reﬂect the nonrelativistic result [12], the relativistic eﬀects which lead to an
enhancement of the ionization probability are condensed in the third term.

It has been shown that there is an enhancement of ionization rate in the relativistic theory for both large and small
η. This should be compared with the results found by Crawford and Reiss. In their numerical calculations they also
found an enhancement of relativistic ionization rate for a circularly polarized ﬁeld and for η

their results suggest a strong reduction of the ionization probability [1]. For the case of linearly polarized light the
ionization rate is found to be reduced by relativistic eﬀects [6]. However, Crawford and Reiss studied the above-barrier
ionization of hydrogen atom within the strong-ﬁeld approximation. In contrast to that we have investigated the sub-
barrier ionization from a strongly bound electron level, which yields an enhancement of the ionization rate. This
enhancement is connected with a smaller initial time t0. As a result the under barrier complex trajectory becomes
shorter and the ionization rate increases in comparison with the nonrelativistic theory. Figure 1 shows the relativistic
ionization rate Eq. (7) and the nonrelativistic Keldysh formula as a function of the binding energy eb. The ﬁgure
should be considered only as an illustration of the enhancement eﬀect. The frequency and intensity parameters used
for the calculations are still not available for the experimentalists.

Consider now the modiﬁcations of the energy spectrum induced by relativistic eﬀects. In the nonrelativistic theory
and in the case of linear polarization the most probable value for the electron momentum at the time of emission,
t = 0, is zero. The electrons are preferably emitted in the direction of the polarization of the laser beam. In the
relativistic theory employed in this paper we may set the constants a1 = a2 = 0 in Eqs. (2). Then we obtain for the
most probable emission velocity in the laboratory system of coordinates

(11)

where α has to be taken as the solution of the second equation of Eqs. (6). In the static limit ω
0 we reproduce the
results of Mur et al. [3]. It follows from these equations that a strongly bounded electron is emitted in the direction of

the laser beam propagation, i.e., perpendicular to the direction of the laser beam polarization. For a nonrelativistic
1, the mean emission velocity along the beam propagation vx = c eb/3 is small. Nevertheless,
initial state, εb ≪
the mean emission velocity seems to be the most sensitive measure of the appearance of relativistic eﬀects in the
initial states. In Fig. 2 the x-component of the leaving velocity is plotted versus the binding energy of the initial
state. Though we have choosen the same parameters of the laser beam as in Fig. 1 it should be mentioned that
the dependence of the emission velocity x-component on the laser parameters is rather weak. The main parameter
determining the leaving velocity along the propagation of the laser beam is the binding energy of the atom.

The electron energy spectrum is also inﬂuenced by relativistic ﬁnal states eﬀects. We put a1 = py,0/mc, a2 = pz,0/mc

In conclusion, the expressions obtained in this paper within exponential accuracy may be improved by taking into
account the Coulomb interaction through the perturbation theory. The results of this paper may be also used in
nuclear physics and quantum chromodynamics.

We present an ab initio method of calculation of isotope shift and relativistic shift in atoms
with a few valence electrons.
It is based on an energy calculation involving combination of the
conﬁguration interaction method and many-body perturbation theory. This work is motivated by
analyses of quasar absorption spectra that suggest that the ﬁne structure constant α was smaller at
an early epoch. Relativistic shifts are needed to measure this variation of α, while isotope shifts are
needed to resolve systematic eﬀects in this study. The isotope shifts can also be used to measure
isotopic abundances in gas clouds in the early universe, which are needed to study nuclear reactions
in stars and supernovae and test models of chemical evolution. This paper shows that isotope shift
in magnesium can be calculated to very high precision using our new method.

INTRODUCTION

The motivation for this work comes from recent studies
of quasar absorption spectra designed to probe α in the
distant past. Atomic transition frequencies depend on
α, and by comparing frequencies on Earth with those in
quasar absorption spectra, one can deduce whether or
not α was diﬀerent in the early universe. While some
studies have revealed a signiﬁcant deviation from zero
(Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4]) other groups using a diﬀerent telescope
have not (Refs. [5, 6]).

One of the possible major sources of systematic eﬀects
in these studies is that the isotopic abundance ratios in
gas clouds in the early universe could be very diﬀerent to
those on Earth. A “conspiracy” of several isotopic abun-
dances may provide an alternative explanation for the
observed variation in spectra [7, 8, 9]. In order to test
this possibility it is necessary to have accurate values
for the isotope shift (IS) for the relevant atomic transi-
tions [10]. Experimental data are available for very few
of them; therefore, accurate calculations are needed in
order to make the most comprehensive analysis possible.
The need for accurate isotope shifts is further moti-
vated by a wish to study isotopic evolution in the uni-
verse. The isotopic abundances of gas clouds may be
measured independently of a variation in α [10]. This is
important for testing models of nuclear reactions in stars
and supernovae and of the chemical evolution of the uni-
verse.

Previously we have calculated isotope shift in atoms
with one valence electron using many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) [11], and for neutral magnesium using
the conﬁguration interaction (CI) method [12]. Both of

these papers used the ﬁnite-ﬁeld scaling method for the
perturbation. In a sense our method combines these two
methods by including core-valence correlations into our
CI method using MBPT. Magnesium is one of the sim-
plest and well studied two-valence-electron atoms. Be-
cause of that it is often used as a test ground for diﬀerent
methods of atomic calculations. In this paper we show
that we can calculate the isotope shift of some magnesium
transitions for which experimental values are available.

II. METHOD

The isotope shifts of atomic transition frequencies
come from two sources:
the ﬁnite size of the nu-
clear charge distribution (the “volume” or “ﬁeld” shift),
[13]).
and the ﬁnite mass of the nucleus (see, e.g.
The energy shift due to recoil of
is
(1/2M )p2
N = (1/2M )(Σpi)2. Furthermore this “mass
shift” is traditionally divided into the normal mass shift
(NMS) and the speciﬁc mass shift (SMS). The normal
mass shift is given by the operator (1/2M )Σp2
i , which
is easily calculated from the transition frequency. The
SMS operator is (1/M )Σi<j(pi · pj) which is diﬃcult to
evaluate accurately.

The shift in energy of any transition in an isotope with
mass number A′ with respect to an isotope with mass
number A can be expressed as

and hr2i is the mean square nuclear radius. The value
1823 refers to the ratio of the atomic mass unit to the
electron mass.

In this paper we develop a method for calculating the
speciﬁc mass shift kSMS for atoms with several valence
electrons. It is worth noting that in this paper we use
the convention δνA

,A = νA

− νA.

Following our previous work, we are looking for an “all
orders” method of calculation. Again we have found that
the ﬁnite-ﬁeld scaling method is very useful in this re-
spect. The rescaled SMS operator is added to the many-
particle Hamiltonian

Hλ = H0 + λHSMS = H0 + λ

The eigenvalue problem for the new Hamiltonian is solved
for various λ, and then we recover the speciﬁc mass shift
constant as

kSMS = lim

.

The operator (3) has the same symmetry and structure as
the initial Hamiltonian H0 (see the Appendix, Ref. [11]).
We have also calculated the relativistic shift for tran-
sitions in magnesium using a similar method. These are
needed in order to measure variation of α [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
The dependence of transition frequencies on α can be ex-
pressed as

ω = ω0 + qx,

− 1, α0 is the laboratory value of the
where x = (α/α0)
ﬁne-structure constant, and ω and ω0 are the frequen-
cies of the transition in the absorption clouds and in the
laboratory, respectively. We vary α directly in codes and
hence calculate q. This method is described in detail in
our earlier works (Refs. [14, 15, 16]).

To calculate the energy, we use a combination of con-
ﬁguration interaction (CI) and many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT), as was done in Refs. [17, 18]. We gen-
erate a basis set that includes the core and valence or-
bitals and a number of virtual orbitals. Then we do the
full conﬁguration interaction calculation in the frozen-
core approximation. Core-valence correlation eﬀects are
taken into account using MBPT by altering the Coulomb
integrals ( ˜Q = 1/ |ri − rj|+λpi·pj) in the CI calculation.
The MBPT operator is separated into two parts: Σ1 and
Σ2, which include all one-valence-electron diagrams and
two-valence-electron diagrams, respectively. The opera-
tors are calculated to second-order, which was shown to
be suﬃcient for single-valence-electron atoms when used
with a ﬁnite-ﬁeld method [11].

III. CALCULATION AND RESULTS

The CI part of the calculation is very similar to the
large basis set calculation in Ref. [12]. We ﬁrst solved
the Dirac-Fock equations for the core electrons; we use
the V N −2 approximation, so the core includes the or-
bitals 1s1/2, 2s1/2, 2p1/2, and 2p3/2. For valence and

virtual orbitals we used a basis formed by diagonaliz-
ing the Dirac-Fock operator on the basis set of B-splines
and excluding orbitals with high energy (for a descrip-
tion of this method as applied in atomic physics, see,
e.g. Refs. [19, 20, 21]).

The full two-electron CI uses the basis 17spdf , which
includes the orbitals 1 − 17s1/2, 2 − 17pj, 3 − 17dj, and
4 − 17fj. It is very close to the saturation of the valence
CI. The MBPT basis can be larger, since the calculation
merely involves a summation over the virtual orbitals; we
have therefore used the basis 32spdf g for this part of the
calculation, which is essentially complete.

Table I shows that our ab initio calculation of the spec-
trum is within 0.4% of the experimental spectrum for all
considered levels. The relativistic shifts (q-values) are
presented in Table II. Table III presents the resulting
SMS level shift constants, kSMS of Eq. (1). In each ta-
ble we present results of the pure CI calculation (which
agree with our previous calculation Ref. [12]), as well as
calculations including Σ1 only, and both Σ1 and Σ2.

It is worth noting a few points. Firstly, the core-
valence eﬀects, included using MBPT, make little diﬀer-
ence to the q-values (less than 10%). This again justiﬁes
the fact that in previous works for atoms with several va-
lence electrons these have either been neglected entirely
or included using a simple ﬁtting procedure based on the
polarisability of the core [16].

The core-valence eﬀects are much more important for
the SMS calculation.
In particular the single-valence-
electron diagrams (included in Σ1) can improve accuracy
drastically in cases where the pure CI method is not very
good. Although Σ2 is important for energy calculation,
it appears to make little diﬀerence to kSMS. This is easily
understood since the most important two-body diagram

uncertainty in most cases and is of the order of the error
in our SMS calculations. Furthermore despite numerous
convergent theoretical calculations of the ﬁeld shift pa-
rameter (F of Eq. (1)), our knowledge of the ﬁeld shift
in magnesium is limited by our lack of knowledge of the
change in mean-square nuclear radius δ

Also presented in Table IV, for a theoretical com-
parison, are the results of Veseth (Ref. [22], 1987) and
J¨onsson et al. (Ref.
[23], 1999). Veseth used non-
relativistic many-body perturbation theory within the al-
gebraic approximation to calculate the isotope shift to
third order for some transitions. J¨onsson et al. used
a non-relativistic multiconﬁguration Hartree-Fock ap-
proach, which allowed for both core and valence exci-
tations in the CI.

An under-studied transition that is seen in quasar ab-
sorption spectra is the 2026 ˚A line of MgI (3s2 1S0 →
3s4p 1P o
1 ). From Table III, we calculate the isotope shift
of this line as δν26,24 = 2950(50) MHz (the error here is
based on the absence of ﬁeld shift as well as the incom-
pleteness of saturation of the basis set used to calculate
kSMS).

We have presented a method for the calculation of the
isotope-shift in many-electron atoms. It is based on the
ﬁnite-ﬁeld method, with an energy calculation that com-
bines CI for the valence electrons and MBPT for the
core-valence correlations. We have tested the method
in magnesium, and the agreement was found to be very
good for all transitions. In particular, for the purposes of
resolving systematic errors in the search for α-variation,
and for studies of isotopic evolution of the universe, such
accuracy is high enough.

We have also used the method to generate more precise
values for the relativistic shift (q-values). These were
found to be within 10% of those found using previous
methods, as expected.

no contribution to the SMS. The exchange diagrams in
Σ2 do have an eﬀect, but this is much smaller than the
one-body contribution.

In Table IV we compare experimental and calcu-
lated frequency shifts between isotopes 26Mg and 24Mg

tracted from experiment by subtracting the NMS. We
have ignored the volume shift for simplicity; it is approx-

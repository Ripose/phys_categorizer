Abstract. – We present a new theoretical analysis of the strongly suppressed F - and M -
dependent Stark shifts of the Cs ground state hyperﬁne structure. Our treatment uses third
order perturbation theory including oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne interactions not considered in earlier
treatments. A numerical evaluation of the perturbation sum using bound states up to n=200
yields ground state tensor polarizabilities α2(6S1/2, F ) which are in good agreement with ex-
perimental values, thereby bridging the 40-year-old gap between experiments and theory. We
have further found that the tensor polarizabilities of the two ground state hyperﬁne manifolds
have opposite signs, in disagreement with an earlier derivation. This sign error has a direct
implication for the precise evaluation of the blackbody radiation shift in primary frequency
standards.

Introduction. – Since its discovery, the Stark eﬀect, i.e., the interaction of an atom with
an external electric ﬁeld E, has played an important role in the spectroscopic investigation
of atomic structure. Because of parity conservation, the Stark eﬀect arises only in second
order perturbation theory for atoms with non-degenerate orbital angular momentum states.

In second order perturbation theory the polarizability can be decomposed [1] into a scalar
polarizability, α(2)
0 , which leads to an F - and M -independent level shift, and a tensor polariz-
ability, α(2)
2 , which yields F - and M -dependent energy shifts. Because of rotational symmetry,
the tensor polarizability vanishes for the spherical nS1/2 and nP1/2 states in the alkalis. As
a consequence, the second order Stark eﬀect in the alkali ground state does not aﬀect its hy-
perﬁne splitting, nor does it lift the Zeeman degeneracy of a given hyperﬁne level. However,

Haun and Zacharias observed already in 1957 [2] that a static electric ﬁeld does induce a
quadratic Stark shift of the hyperﬁne transition frequency (F -dependent Stark eﬀect), and in
1964, Lipworth and Sandars [3] demonstrated that a static electric ﬁeld also lifts the Zeeman
degeneracy within the F = 4 sublevel manifold of the cesium ground state (an
-dependent
|
eﬀect). Improved measurements were performed later by Carrico et al. [4] and Gould et al. [5],
and were recently conﬁrmed by our own measurements [6–8]. In 1967, Sandars [9] showed that
the F - and
-dependence of the Stark eﬀect can be explained when the perturbation theory
|
is extended to third order after including the hyperﬁne interaction. His theoretical expressions
for the third order tensor polarizabilties α(3)
2 were evaluated numerically in [3] and [5] under
simplifying assumptions. This yielded (absolute) values which were systematically larger than
the experimental values for the ﬁve investigated alkali isotopes [5]. It is worth noting that in
cesium the level shifts due to α(3)
2 are almost seven orders of magnitude smaller than the com-
mon shift of the ground state levels due to the second order scalar polarizability α(2)
0 . While
10−3 [10–12], there has so far been
the scalar Stark shift is understood at a level of (1–2)
no satisfactory theoretical description of the tensor polarizabilities, i.e., of the

alterations of the scalar eﬀect.

In this paper we extend the previous theoretical treatment of the third order eﬀects by
including both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne interactions in the perturbation expansion.
The numerical evaluation of the perturbation sum then yields a value of the Cs ground state
tensor polarizability α2(6S1/2, F = 4) which is in very good agreement with the experimental
results [4–8], thereby bridging the 40-year-old gap [8] between experiments and theory. We
have also identiﬁed an error in Sandars’ results [9] concerning the relative sign of the tensor
polarizabilities of the two ground state hyperﬁne levels. We discuss the relevance of this sign
error for the determination of the black-body radiation shift of primary frequency standards
from measurements of the static Stark shift of the Cs clock frequency.

Theoretical model. – As shown by Sandars [9], the F - and M -dependent Stark shifts
can be explained by a third order perturbation treatment, in which the Stark interaction,
hf) and electric quadrupole (Hq
hf) hyperﬁne interactions,
HSt =
hf + Hq
are treated on an equal footing. The contributions of HSt and Hhf = Hd
hf can be expressed
in terms of irreducible tensor operators

where L, S, and I are vector operators associated with the orbital angular momentum, the
electronic spin, and the nuclear spin, respectively, and where the C(k) are normalized spherical
harmonics of rank k. The ﬁrst and second terms of Eq. (3) represent the magnetic interaction
of the nuclear magnetic moment with the orbital and electron spin dipole moments respectively
(dipole-dipole interactions), while the third term represents the Fermi contact interaction and
Eq. (4) is the electric quadrupole interaction. The corresponding coupling constants are al,j,
as, and bQ. The contact interaction term has non-zero matrix elements between S-states
(L = 0) only, while the ﬁrst two terms of Eq. (3) apply to states with L > 0. The electric
quadrupole term of Eq. (4) requires L > 1 and J > 1, and for Cs nP3/2 states its matrix
elements are two orders of magnitude smaller than all other contributions.

for the second order scalar Stark eﬀect, one sees that the F-dependent third order shift is

suppressed by a factor on the order of Ehf (6S)/(E6P −

to the Stark shift of the hyperﬁne transition frequency.

shifts. The electric ﬁeld dependent factor of Eq. (8) has only a rank k = 0 (scalar) contribution,
while the dipole-dipole [Eq. (3)] and the electric quadrupole [Eq. (4)] parts of the Hhf factor
in Eq. (8) have the rotational symmetries of k = 0, 2 and k = 2 tensors, respectively. The
contraction of the hyperﬁne and the Stark interactions in Eq. (8) thus yields both scalar and
second rank tensor contributions. The scalar part of Eq. (8) has the same F -dependence [8] as
α(3)
0 (F ), and gives a correction to the latter on the order of 1%, while the second rank tensor
part has an F - and M -dependence, which can be parametrized in terms of a third order tensor
polarizability α(3)

2 (6S1/2, F ).

The total third order polarizability can thus be written as

Equations (10) closely resemble the expressions derived by Sandars [9], except for the
negative sign of the a1 term in Eq. (10b) which is positive in Sandars’ work. To our knowl-
edge, this sign cannot be derived from any prior experiment. We have recently conﬁrmed
experimentally [7] that the tensor polarizabilities of the F = 3 and F = 4 states have indeed
opposite signs as predicted by our calculation. This sign error has remained unnoticed in the
literature for almost 40 years and we will come back to its relevance for atomic clocks below.

Numerical evaluation of the tensor polarizability. – The tensor polarizability (a1 term)
of the F = 4 state of cesium was evaluated in [5] by considering only diagonal matrix elements
of Hhf for the 6S1/2 and the 6PJ states. The contribution of the orbital magnetic dipole
hyperﬁne interaction [ﬁrst term in Eq. (13)] was neglected, as well as the spin-orbit splitting
in the denominators of Eq. (5). The authors assumed furthermore that A6P1/2 /A6P3/2 = 5,
valid for one-electron atoms, while for Cs the corresponding ratio of experimental values is 5.8.
Under the latter two approximations one can factor the second order scalar polarizability α(2)
0
out of the expression for the tensor polarizability. Those simplifying assumptions yielded the
α(3)
2 (F = 4) value represented as point (f) in Fig. 2, in disagreement with the experimental
results. We have reevaluated the result by including the orbital part of the hyperﬁne inter-
[5] by using the most recent experimental value of
action and then rescaling the value of

periments. In a second, more precise, calculation we dropped all the simplifying assumptions
mentioned above [8], still keeping diagonal matrix elements only, and numerically evaluated
Eqs. (13,14) by using recent experimental values [13] of the reduced dipole matrix elements

Oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne interaction. – All calculations described above considered only
diagonal hyperﬁne matrix elements. However, the ﬁrst term in Eq. (5) allows also oﬀ-diagonal
hyperﬁne terms. Figure 1 gives a schematic overview of all possible oﬀ-diagonal conﬁgurations
compatible with the hyperﬁne and Stark operator selection rules. It is interesting to note that
some oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne matrix elements (diagrams 1 and 2, Fig. 1) were already considered
by Feichtner et al. [14] in their calculation of the clock transition Stark shift, but for unknown
reasons such terms were never considered in the tensor polarizability calculation.

The contact interaction selection rule ∆L = 0 admits only oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements
between the ground state and higher lying S1/2 states (diagram 1, Fig. 1). The orbital and spin
dipolar magnetic interactions also obey ∆L = 0 and have nonvanishing oﬀ-diagonal matrix
(diagrams 2, 3 and 4). Due to the second
elements of the form

|
rank tensor character of C(2), the spin dipolar term also couples states with ∆L =
2 and
can thus contribute to the third order Stark eﬀect with oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements between
the ground state and D3/2 states (diagram 5). We have used the Schr¨odinger equation with a
statistical Thomas-Fermi model potential to calculate the relevant wave functions of the free
Cs atom. Corrections for the dipolar and quadrupolar core polarization as well as spin-orbit
interaction with a relativistic correction factor following [15] were included. The electric dipole
and hyperﬁne matrix elements were calculated using the Schr¨odinger wave functions for all
matrix elements for which no precise values could be found in the literature. In this way we
evaluated all diagrams in Fig. 1 by running the summation indices m and n up to 200.

Relative contributions and numerical results. – Diagrams A and 1 of Fig. 1 yield only
F -dependent energy shifts, and thus do not contribute to the tensor polarizability. All other
diagrams produce F - and M -dependent eﬀects. The relative importance with which diagrams
B and 2–5 contribute to α(3)
is +145, +99, -40, -3, and -101%, respectively. A numerical eval-

result is shown as a dotted line in Fig. 2 together with previous theoretical and experimental
results. We estimate the uncertainty of our calculated value to be 7%, based on the precision
(2–8%) with which our Schr¨odinger solutions can reproduce measured dipole matrix elements
and hyperﬁne splittings, and considering that some (more precise) experimental values were
included in the calculations, whenever they were available. We have also veriﬁed that contin-

One of the leading systematic shifts of the clock transition frequency is due to the interaction of

This shift can be calculated from Eq. (16) by averaging E2 over the Planck spectrum [16,17,19].
Because of the isotropy of the blackbody radiation the θ dependence in Eq. (16) vanishes, so
that the BBR shift is determined by the scalar part a0 only. The BBR shift coeﬃcient can be
deduced from the measured shift of the clock transition frequency induced by a static electric
ﬁeld. For this one has to know the value of the a1 term in Eq. (16) which is aﬀected by the

sign error, the coeﬃcient of a1 being

Conclusions. – We have extended a previous treatment of the Stark interaction by
including oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne matrix elements in the third order perturbation expansion.
Our calculation of the tensor polarizability yields a good agreement with all experimental
data, thereby removing a 40-year-old discrepancy. A sign error identiﬁed in Sandars’ model
leads to a new expression for the static Stark shift of the hyperﬁne transition frequency which
10−17, which is below
requires Cs primary frequency standards to be corrected at a level of 6
their present accuracy.

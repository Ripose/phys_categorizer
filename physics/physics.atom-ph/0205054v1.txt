Studies with Ultracold Metastable Hydrogen

Abstract

This thesis describes the ﬁrst detailed studies of trapped metastable (2S-state) H.

Recent apparatus enhancements in the MIT Ultracold Hydrogen group have enabled the
107 magnetically trapped 2S atoms at densities exceeding
1010 cm−3 and temperatures below 100 µK. At these densities and temperatures, two-

production of clouds of at least 5

body inelastic collisions between 2S atoms are evident. From decay measurements of the

2S clouds, experimental values for the total two-body loss rate K2 are derived: K2 =
1.8+1.8
−0.5 cm3/s at 230 µK. These values are in range
of recent theoretical calculations for the total 2S-2S inelastic rate constant. Experimental

−0.7 cm3/s at 87 µK, and K2 = 1.0+0.9

upper limits for K12, the rate constant for loss due to inelastic 1S-2S collisions, are also

determined. As part of the discussion and analysis, results from numerical simulations to

elucidate 2S spatial distributions, evolution of the 2S cloud shape, and ﬂuorescence behavior

in the magnetic trap are presented. This work serves as a bridge to future spectroscopy

of trapped metastable H with the potential to test quantum electrodynamics (QED) and

improve fundamental constants.

Acknowledgments

This thesis is joyfully dedicated to my parents, Jesse and Kim Landhuis. From

an early age, they instilled in me a curiosity about the natural world and a yearning for

truth. They spent much time with me as a child and opened every door they could for my

intellectual growth. I am grateful for the many good things which I have inherited from

my parents, including the desire to pursue excellence in whatever task is at hand, great or

small. My hope is that they can be proud of the work represented in these pages.

I am deeply grateful to my research advisors, the MIT professors Dan Kleppner

and Tom Greytak. Because they welcomed me, a Harvard student, into the MIT Ultracold

Hydrogen Group more than six years ago, I have been able to experience the best of both

the MIT and Harvard physics worlds. In their research group, I have come of age as an

experimental scientist. I learned a tremendous amount in these years, not only about atomic

and low-temperature physics but also about tenacity, perseverance, and thinking for oneself.

I very much appreciated Dan’s and Tom’s generosity and hospitality as well, including the

regular invitations to their homes both in Boston and among the lakes and mountains to

the north.

The experimental results described here would not have been possible without

Stephen Moss and Lorenz Willmann, my two closest colleagues over the last few years. I

have appreciated their friendship, camaraderie, and tremendous work ethic. Stephen was

tireless in ensuring that the cryogenic apparatus was working well, improving our computer

systems, and writing essential code to run the experiments for this thesis. His stamina,

commitment, and sense of humor through grueling weeks of debugging and taking data did

much for my morale. At the same time, I was lucky to share an oﬃce with Lorenz, an

excellent experimentalist. He was the source of many good ideas, and I learned a lot from

our spirited discussions at the whiteboard. The numerical simulation of 1S-2S excitation

developed by Lorenz was crucial for the analysis of metastable H decay.

It was also good fortune for me that Julia Steinberger, Kendra Vant, and Lia

Matos joined our research group. In addition to the talents they brought, I am grateful for

the positive attitudes they maintained while confronting numerous onerous tasks. Each of

them stayed late on many nights to help take data and also performed many of the regular

chores necessary to keep the experiment running. With these able graduate students in

charge, the prospects for groundbreaking new measurements are bright.

I also thank Walter Joﬀrain, a visting graduate student in our group during the

metastable H studies. He cheerfully helped with data acquisition and sometimes dispelled

the late-night monotony by breaking spontaneously into song.

A major reason I joined the hydrogen experiment was the outstanding students

who preceded me and were to become my mentors. These are Dale Fried and Tom Killian,

who are not only excellent scientists but also highly personable. It was a pleasure to learn

from them.

Several theoretical atomic physicists were my educators in the relevant theory

for metastable H collisions.

In particular, I thank Alex Dalgarno, Piotr Froelich, and

Bob Forrey for extensive and helpful conversations. Several years ago, they and their

collaborators began calculating the collision cross-sections for metastables. Their work

provides a basis for interpretation of experimental results in this thesis.

A number of administrative staﬀ at both MIT and Harvard helped smooth my

path through graduate school. I only name two here, for whom I am particularly grateful:

Sheila Ferguson of the Harvard Physics Department, and Carol Costa of the Center for

Ultracold Atoms.

I am fortunate to have a cadre of solid friends outside the lab, both in Boston and

far away, who have sharpened me and shared in the trials and joys of my Harvard years. In

this respect, I especially want to thank Stefan Haney, David Nancekivell, Paul Ashby, Lou

Soiles, and Timothy Landhuis.

Graduate school has been a tremendous time of learning and of developing friend-

ships with remarkable people. The best thing that happened to me during this era, though,

is that I married Esther, my wonderful wife. Her generous acts of love, sympathetic ear,

and optimistic outlook have carried me through these last intense years of studenthood. I

hope I will be as supportive and encouraging for her as she ﬁnishes her own thesis research.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the Creator, whom I believe is also

Jesus Christ: Thank you for the opportunity to live, work, and learn alongside outstanding

colleagues and among caring friends. Your physical universe is intricate and beautiful, and

I am grateful to have been able to study a small corner of it.

Introduction

The 2S state of hydrogen is metastable because it decays by two-photon sponta-

neous emission. It has a natural lifetime of 122 ms. This is not the only sense in which

this species is long-lived, however. It has enjoyed a long and fruitful life in atomic physics

research. From the explanation of the Balmer series of spectral lines, to the groundbreaking

ﬁrst calculation of a two-photon decay rate, on through numerous rf and optical measure-

ments of the Lamb shift, metastable hydrogen has played a key role. The studies described

in this thesis are part of a new chapter in this unfolding history, one which will likely lead

to further insight into fundamental physics.

Traditionally, metastable H has been studied in discharge cells or in atomic H

beams which have been excited by a laser or by electron bombardment. In the MIT Ultracold

Hydrogen Group, the application of a high-power, narrow-linewidth UV laser system to

magnetically trapped 1S-state hydrogen has produced clouds of metastables at temperatures

ranging from 300 mK down to 20 µK. Recent improvements to the apparatus at MIT have
allowed generation of clouds of more than 107 2S atoms at densities greater than 1010 cm−3

and lifetimes of nearly 100 ms. These trapped metastable clouds are promising new samples

for collisional physics and precision spectroscopy.

In the ﬁrst section of this introduction, the impetus for studying cold, trapped

metastable H is futher discussed. This is followed by a brief overview of concepts relevant

to magnetic trapping and 1S-2S excitation.

1.1 Motivations

2

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1.1 Metastable H Collisions

A cold gas of metastable H is an interesting laboratory for collisional physics. One

reason for this is that a 2S atom carries more than 10 eV of internal energy, enough to cause

ionization in many targets and to drive chemical reactions. When metastables collide with

one another, the possible outcomes include Penning ionization, the formation of molecular

ions, excitation transfer to short-lived 2P states, and transitions between hyperﬁne states. If

the 2S atoms are excited from a background 1S gas, then several 1S-2S collision processes

can occur as well. Various aspects of cold, elastic 1S-2S interactions have already been

investigated by our group [1, 2] and by several theory collaborations [3, 4, 5].

Collisions between metastables have previously been studied at high eﬀective tem-

peratures (T > 48 K) [6], where the total inelastic rate constant is several orders of mag-

nitude larger than at T = 0 [7, 8]. At high temperatures, the rate constant for excitation

transfer or “collisional quenching” has been predicted to limit the lifetime of a metastable
gas to about 40 µs at a density of 1010 cm−3[9]. With cold, magnetically trapped clouds

of 2S atoms, the lifetime at this density is found to be tens of milliseconds. By observing

the decay behavior of a metastable cloud, we can learn about 2S-2S and 1S-2S inelastic

collisions. This thesis presents the ﬁrst measurements of the total 2S-2S inelastic colli-

sion rate at low temperatures. These measurements extend into the theoretically predicted

“ultracold” regime, where both elastic and inelastic collisions are parametrized by a single

constant, the complex scattering length [7, 10].

1.1.2 Spectroscopy of Metastable H

Although the collisional physics of metastables is worth studying for its own sake,

a deeper understanding of these interactions also helps set the stage for ultraprecise spec-

troscopy of metastable H. The absolute frequencies of transitions from the 2S to higher-lying

states of H can be combined with the 1S-2S interval, currently the most accurately known

of all optical transition frequencies, to simultaneously determine the 1S Lamb shift and

the Rydberg constant [11, 12]. The former quantity is predominantly comprised of quan-

tum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the Dirac solution for the hydrogen atom, and

it has been called the most sensitive test of QED in an atom. The Rydberg constant,
R∞ = mecα2/2h, is already the most accurately known of all fundamental constants. It
provides a link between the electron mass, the speed of light, the ﬁne structure constant,

and Planck’s constant. Thus, spectroscopy of metastable H provides a way to not only test

the state-of-the-art of QED theory but also improve the accuracy of fundamental constants

Chapter 1: Introduction

[12, 13, 14].

Several 2S-nS/D frequency intervals, where n > 3, have been measured with

impressive accuracy by F. Biraben and collaborators using Doppler-free two-photon spec-

troscopy [15, 16, 17, 12]. Currently, the best experimental values for both the Lamb shift

and Rydberg constant are limited by uncertainty in 2S-nS/D frequencies [12]. The Biraben

experiments were conducted with atomic beams in which the interaction time of metastables

with a laser was limited to a few hundred microseconds. To achieve an eﬃcient excitation

rate required laser intensities of several kilowatts per square centimeter. The resulting AC

Stark shifts were the primary source of uncertainty in the measurement. With a cold,

trapped sample of metastable H, the interaction times between the excitation laser and

the atoms can be much larger, and laser intensities can be much lower. Another source of

systematic error in the beam experiments was the quadratic DC Stark shift of higher-lying

D states. Since excitation rates can be much higher in a trapped sample, one can aﬀord to

concentrate on weaker 2S-nS transitions, which are less sensitive to stray electric ﬁelds.

Once an excitation laser is tuned to a two-photon 2S-nS resonance, its absolute

frequency can be calibrated directly against the primary cesium standard or against the

1S-2S frequency, which is now a de facto optical frequency standard [13]. The frequency

metrology can be accomplished with a mode-locked femtosecond laser which produces a

broad, coherent frequency comb [18, 19, 20]. Frequency measurements made in this way

using ultracold hydrogen will potentially allow an order of magnitude improvement in both

the Lamb shift and Rydberg constant [21].

Since many transitions originating in the 2S state are accessible with diodes and

other readily available lasers, trapped metastable H as a spectroscopic sample opens the

door to other interesting studies as well. These include photoassociation experiments and

measurements of cold collision parameters involving higher-lying states of H.

1.1.3 Quantum Atom Optics

Due to its large internal energy, cold metastable H is interesting for “quantum atom

optics” experiments involving single-atom detection. The possibilities include measurements

to probe atom-atom correlations [22], atom interferometry, and atom holography [23]. A

metastable H atom is readily detected in an ionizing collision on an electron-multiplying

detector. Alternatively, one can detect the Lyman-α photon emitted after quenching at a

surface or by a localized electric ﬁeld. To detect individual metastables generated from ul-

tracold hydrogen, they must be coupled out of the magnetic trap. This can be accomplished

by inducing an appropriate rf or optical transition to an untrapped atomic state or by sim-

4

Chapter 1: Introduction

ply turning oﬀ the magnetic trap. Several single-atom detection experiments involving cold,

metastable noble gases have already been demonstrated [22, 23] or are in progress [24]. It

may also be possible to generate a highly directional metastable H beam from an ultracold

sample using photon recoil in a Raman transition [25] or in the initial 1S-2S excitation (see

Sec. 1.3). A bright beam of cold metastables may be ideal for atom lithography [26, 27].

1.2 Hyperﬁne States and Magnetic Trapping

The hyperﬁne state energies for both the 1S and 2S levels of H are plotted as a
function of magnetic ﬁeld in Fig. 1.1. The hyperﬁne interaction energy, which scales as 1/n3

for S states, is only 1/8 as large for metastable hydrogen as for the ground state. Except

for this hyperﬁne energy scaling, the 2S manifold is basically identical to the 1S manifold.

In both levels, the hyperﬁne states are conventionally labeled a, b, c, and d, in

order of increasing energy. At low magnetic ﬁeld, these states correspond to the total

angular momentum states (F = 0, mF = 0), (F = 1, mF =

1), (F = 1, mF = 0), and

−

(F = 1, mF = 1), respectively. In an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, the “low-ﬁeld seeking”

c and d states can be trapped around a minimum of the magnetic ﬁeld [28, 29]. Since c-state

atoms rapidly undergo spin-exchange collisions and transition to other hyperﬁne states, the

sample which collects in a magnetic trap ultimately contains only d-state atoms. The trap

loading process for 1S atoms will be discussed extensively in Sec. 2.4.

Trapped metastable hydrogen is produced by two-photon excitation of trapped

(1S, d) atoms [30]. The two-photon selection rules are ∆F = 0 and ∆mF = 0; thus, only

trapped (2S, d) atoms are excited. Furthermore, since the magnetic potential energy of
both (1S, d) and (2S, d) atoms is to an excellent approximation1

U = µBB,

(1.1)

where µB is the Bohr magneton and B the local magnetic ﬁeld strength, the trapping

potentials experienced by both species is the same.

The trap in our apparatus is of the Ioﬀe-Pritchard variety [32]. To a good approxi-

mation, the magnetic ﬁeld has cylindrical symmetry about an axis known as the “trap axis.”

With an aspect ratio typically between 150:1 and 400:1, the axial dimension of the trap is

much longer than the radial dimension. A typical ﬁeld geometry is depicted in Fig. 1.2.

The depth of the trap is determined by a saddlepoint in the magnetic ﬁeld located on the

1The magnetic moments of 2S and 1S electrons diﬀer by less than 5 parts in 104 due to a relativistic
correction [31]. Also, the nuclear Zeeman contribution is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than
the electron contribution responsible for µB.

Figure 1.3: Composite 1S-2S spectrum of a thermal trapped hydrogen sample, showing both
Doppler-free and Doppler-sensitive contributions. In the Doppler-free excitation mode, a
hydrogen atom is promoted to the 2S state by absorbing counter-propagating 243 nm pho-

is narrow and intense. In the Doppler-sensitive excitation mode, where two co-propagating
photons are absorbed, the spectrum is both recoil-shifted and Doppler-broadened.

1.3 Two-Photon 1S-2S Excitation

Excitation of the 1S-2S transition is accomplished using two 243 nm photons from

a UV laser. The hydrogen 1S-2S spectrum has both Doppler-free and Doppler-sensitive

resonances, separated by a recoil shift (see Fig. 1.3). Although the natural linewidth of

the 1S-2S transition is only 0.65 Hz at 243 nm, the experimental Doppler-free linewidth

is at least a few kilohertz due to a combination of transit-time broadening [30], ﬁnite laser

linewidth, and the cold-collision frequency shift [2]. By comparison, the Doppler-sensitive

line has a width of

4 MHz at the coldest experimental temperatures, and the width grows

∼

with increasing temperature. To excite large numbers of metastables, the laser is tuned to

the narrow, intense Doppler-free spectral feature.

The hallmark of the Doppler-free resonance is the cusp-like lineshape which arises

is called “double-exponential” because it consists of two exponential functions meeting at

a cusp. For temperatures at which the above criteria for gas density and laser collimation

are approximately satisﬁed, the relative width of the Doppler line is a useful measure of

relative sample temperature (Fig. 1.4) [30, 1]. Low sample densities must be employed to
resolve these double-exponential lineshapes. At high 1S densities (> 1013 cm−3), the 1S-2S

cold-collision shift ﬂattens the cusp and signiﬁcantly broadens the line [2].

The Doppler-sensitive spectrum (Fig. 1.5) is proportional to the momentum distri-

bution of the sample along the direction of the excitation laser [34]. As long as the sample is

not close to quantum degeneracy, the distribution is Maxwell-Boltzmann, and the lineshape

is Gaussian; this is always the case for samples in this thesis. Like the Doppler-free double-
exponential, the Doppler-sensitive width scales as √T . Unlike the Doppler-free case, the

width is simply related to the absolute temperature and is independent of the laser and trap

geometry. A Gaussian ﬁt to the Doppler-sensitive spectrum provides the most direct way of

calibrating the temperature of a trapped hydrogen sample. Unfortunately, at temperatures

1.4 Overview of the Thesis

The next chapter will begin by describing the experimental sequence applied to

produce a cloud of trapped 2S atoms. The later sections of Ch. 2 focus on apparatus and

techniques which have not yet been detailed in other theses and publications; these include

the method for metastable decay measurements. Chapter 3 delves into several aspects of the

physics of metastable H in a magnetic trap, mostly from a theoretical standpoint. Chapter 4

describes the magnetic trap conﬁgurations used in decay measurements and introduces data

suggesting the presence of two-body loss in our metastable clouds. The analysis of decay

data to calculate a 2S-2S loss rate constant and place limits on inelastic 1S-2S collision

rates is presented in Ch. 5.

In the concluding chapter, some suggestions are made for

further experiments using the current apparatus and also for a new apparatus optimized

for spectroscopy of metastable H.

Throughout this thesis, the term “2S” is used interchangeably with the term

“metastable”; the same applies for “1S” and “ground state.”

Chapter 2

Techniques

Apparatus and Experimental

The apparatus used for experiments described in this thesis was developed with two

principal goals in mind: (1) observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in atomic hydrogen

and (2) high resolution spectroscopy of ultracold hydrogen on the 1S-2S transition. These

goals required the parallel development of a sophisticated cryogenic apparatus and a highly

frequency-stable UV laser system. Many of the important developments have been described

in other PhD theses from the MIT Ultracold Hydrogen Group [29, 36, 38, 39, 1]. This

chapter will recapitulate the methods used to generate and probe ultracold hydrogen with

emphasis on recent reﬁnements. The ﬁrst section provides an overview of the trap cycle

used for measurements in this thesis, while the following sections discuss details of our

techniques which, for the most part, have not been recorded elsewhere.

2.1 A Typical Trap Cycle

Samples of atomic hydrogen are generated, trapped, cooled, and probed in a cycle

lasting typically 5–15 minutes depending on the desired ﬁnal sample temperature and type

of measurement. At the beginning of each cycle, pulses of rf power are supplied to a copper

coil in a cylindrical resonator [1] which is thermally anchored (Fig. 2.1) to the mixing

chamber of a dilution refrigerator. The resulting rf discharge vaporizes and dissociates

frozen molecular hydrogen from surfaces in the resonator. Atoms in all four 1S hyperﬁne

states are injected into a trapping cell. The two high ﬁeld seeking states (a and b) are drawn

back to the 4 T magnetic ﬁeld in the discharge region, while the low ﬁeld seekers (c and d)

are attracted to the 0.6 K deep Ioﬀe-Pritchard magnetic trap [32] in the trapping cell (see

11

12

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

Figs. 2.4 and 2.5).

In order for trapping to be successful, a suﬃciently thick ﬁlm of superﬂuid He must

coat the walls of the cell. The low ﬁeld seekers are cooled initially by interaction with the

cell walls. While the discharge operates, the cell is held at a temperature of 320 mK, which

is warm enough for the residence time of H atoms on the He ﬁlm to be shorter than the

time it takes for atoms to spin-ﬂip on the walls, and cold enough for a sizeable fraction of H

atoms to settle into the trap after exchanging energy in elastic collisions [29]. The c-state

atoms disappear in a few seconds due to spin-exchange collisions, and a pure d-state (F = 1,

mF = 1) gas remains in the trap. After the loading period is ﬁnished, the cell is rapidly

cooled to below 100 mK by the dilution refrigerator. At this temperature, atoms with

enough energy to reach the walls are permanently lost from the trapped sample. Evaporative

cooling begins, and the sample becomes thermally disconnected from the cell. Once thermal

disconnect is complete, the atom cloud equilibrates at a temperature of typically 40 mK.

The threshold energy of the magnetic trap is determined by a saddlepoint of the

magnetic ﬁeld at one end of the trap. Atoms with energy above threshold can escape over

the saddlepoint, leading to evaporative cooling of the sample. By progressively lowering

the saddlepoint ﬁeld, evaporation is forced.

In this way, the sample can be cooled to

temperatures as low as

200 µK in 4-5 minutes.

∼

In order to reach sample temperatures down to

20 µK, rf evaporation is em-

∼

ployed. For a given rf frequency νrf, there is a three-dimensional “surface of death” consist-

ing of all points having a magnetic ﬁeld such that the d-c and c-b hyperﬁne transitions of

the atoms are resonant. Atoms with energy greater than hνrf can cross the surface of death

several times per millisecond and quickly transition to an untrapped state. Thus, νrf sets an

eﬃcient threshold for the trap. The coldest temperatures in the MIT hydrogen experiment

are achieved by ramping νrf from 35 MHz (signiﬁcantly above the magnetic trap threshold)

to the desired ﬁnal threshold value, usually between 5 and 20 MHz (240 and 960 µK).

The dramatic cooling of the sample by several orders of magnitude in tempera-

ture is accomplished at the expense of atom number. The magnetic trap, initially loaded
1011 atoms at the 200 µK limit of magnetic saddle-
with
point evaporation and fewer than 1010 atoms at the lowest temperatures accessible by rf

1014 atoms, contains only

∼

∼

evaporation.

Atoms are lost during the trap cycle not only to evaporation but also to two-body

“dipolar” decay collisions [40]. These are d + d collisions in which the magnetic dipole inter-

action causes at least one of the two atoms to change spin state. They occur preferentially

in the highest density region of the sample, where the average energy of an atom is less

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

13

than kT . Thus dipolar decay leads to heating of the sample. To maintain a favorable ratio

of elastic to inelastic collisions, the radially conﬁning ﬁelds are reduced simultaneously with

the saddlepoint ﬁeld to prevent the atom density from growing signiﬁcantly as the temper-

ature drops. During rf evaporation, however, the peak density grows rapidly, and dipolar

losses set a limit on the temperature which can be reached.

For experiments with metastable hydrogen, the last phase of the trap cycle involves

repeated two-photon excitation of the ground state sample with a 243 nm UV laser nearly

resonant with the Doppler-free 1S-2S transition. A typical excitation pulse lasts 1

3 ms.

∼

The resulting 2S atoms are quenched by an electric ﬁeld pulse after a wait time of up to

100 ms; these quenched atoms are mostly lost from the trap [36]. However, the quenching

process also results in Lyman-α ﬂuorescence photons, some of which are detected on a

microchannel plate (MCP) detector. The number of signal counts recorded is proportional
108 or fewer

to the number of metastables present at the time of quenching. Typically,

2S atoms are excited per laser pulse. Thus, metastable clouds can be generated hundreds

of times with diﬀerent wait times and laser frequencies before depleting the ground state

sample.

For measurements on the ground state atoms, two methods of probing are avail-

able. First, there is conventional 1S-2S excitation spectroscopy [30, 1], already introduced

in Ch. 1. In this mode of taking data, the laser is typically chopped at 100 Hz with a 10%

duty cycle, and a quenching electric ﬁeld pulse is applied at a ﬁxed time of

6 ms after

excitation. The laser frequency is stepped back and forth across a speciﬁed range, each

sweep of the range lasting less than 1 s. This provides a series of snapshots in time of some

portion of the 1S-2S spectrum. The spectroscopic data provides crucial information about

the sample (see Ch. 1). At higher sample densities, the broadening of the Doppler-free line

due to the cold-collision shift provides information about the density distribution of the

sample. At low densities, the Doppler-free width is proportional to the square root of the

temperature. At low temperatures, the width of the Doppler-sensitive line is an excellent

measure of absolute temperature.

The second and older method of probing the ground state sample involves “dump-

ing” the atoms from the trap and detecting the recombination heat on a bolometer [29].

This method involves rapidly lowering the saddlepoint magnetic barrier, allowing the atoms

to escape to a zero ﬁeld region and/or forming a zero ﬁeld region in the trap. The atoms

quickly spin-ﬂip and recombine. The integral of the resulting bolometer signal is propor-

tional to the number of atoms in the trap. An important application of this technique is

the determination of initial sample density from the decay in 1S number due to dipolar loss

Throughout the trap cycle a dedicated computer controls the necessary power

supplies, frequency sources, relays, heaters, and data acquisition electronics.

2.2 Enhancements to the Cryogenic Apparatus

In 1998, our group successfully demonstrated rf evaporation in a cryogenic trapping

apparatus. The enabling technology was a new nonmetallic trapping cell consisting of two

concentric G-10 tubes [39]. By eliminating metal parts from the cell, suﬃcient rf power for

evaporation could be delivered to coils wrapped directly on the inner G-10 tube without

placing an excessive heat load on the dilution refrigerator. In the nonmetallic design, heat

transport to the mixing chamber was provided by ﬁlling the volume between the tubes with

superﬂuid helium.

The cryogenic trapping cell used for experiments described in this thesis repre-

sents a second-generation nonmetallic design. A major problem of the ﬁrst-generation G-10

cell was the presence of relatively large stray electric ﬁelds (

500 mV/cm) which limited

∼

metastable lifetimes to between a few hundred microseconds and a few milliseconds. Worse

yet, the stray ﬁelds sometimes changed unpredictably on a time scale of minutes. Many

spectroscopy runs were rendered almost useless by these ﬁelds. Furthermore, since short

2S lifetimes did not aﬀord the opportunity to wait for laser-induced background ﬂuores-

cence to die away after excitation, the stray ﬁelds limited the signal-to-noise ratio in 1S-2S

spectroscopy. The problem of stray ﬁelds was solved in the second-generation G-10 cell by

adding a thin copper ﬁlm to the inside cell wall. This ﬁlm was thin enough to avoid signiﬁ-

cant absorption of rf power, yet thick enough to suppress stray ﬁelds to the 40 mV/cm level.

With the copper ﬁlm, 2S lifetimes in excess of 80 ms have been observed, and the stability

of stray ﬁelds is much improved. Since the ﬁlm is divided into several externally controllable

electrodes, partial compensation of the residual stray ﬁelds is possible (Sec. 2.6.5).

Another change in the second-generation design was the relocation of rf evapora-

tion coils to the inner vacuum chamber (IVC) “tailpiece,” which separates the surrounding

magnets and liquid helium bath at 4 K from the vacuum space containing the trapping cell.

In the ﬁrst-generation G-10 cell, the heat load on the dilution refrigerator due to the evap-

oration coil leads placed a limit on the allowable rf drive power. Furthermore, intolerable

heating of the cell occurred at absorptive resonances above 25 MHz. By thermally anchor-

ing the coils to the 4 K bath instead of the dilution refrigerator, heating of the rf leads was

no longer a limitation. The absorptive resonances were also shifted such that rf evaporation

could occur in a continuous downward sweep from 35 MHz. This permits more eﬃcient rf

evaporation and may also enable better shielding of the sample from a high-energy atom
“Oort cloud” which forms during magnetic saddlepoint evaporation [41, 42].1 To accom-

plish relocation of the coils, the middle portion of the brass IVC tailpiece was replaced by

a G-10 section of slightly smaller diameter. The nonmetallic section was necessary to allow

propagation of the rf from the coils to the atoms.

In the second-generation design, minor changes were made to the geometry of the

detection end of the trapping cell, slightly increasing the solid angle of detection. Further

details on the construction of the current cryogenic apparatus are given by Moss [43].

The introduction of a nonmetallic trapping cell allowing rf evaporation in a cryo-

genic environment was not only necessary for the achievement of BEC, but also enabled

us to generate higher densities of metastables than ever before. These higher densities,

together with the addition of electrical shielding to the “plastic” G-10 tube, were crucial

prerequisites for the observation of two-body metastable loss described in Chapters 4 and

5.

2.3 The Bolometer

2.3.1 Construction

The current bolometer design is a reﬁnement of those described in the theses of

Yu [44] and Doyle [29]. Following a suggestion of D. G. Fried, the area of the electrodes was

reduced to ameliorate rf pickup. A new construction method was developed after thermal

cycling tests with diﬀerent glues and wire-bonding methods, and it has proven to be highly

robust against thermal stress and mechanical shock. For the beneﬁt of those wishing to

construct such a bolometer themselves, a detailed description of this important diagnostic

device is presented here.

The ideal bolometer has a very small heat capacity, good internal thermal conduc-

tivity, and good thermal and electrical isolation from its surroundings. Quartz was chosen

as the substrate because its heat capacity at millikelvin temperatures is tiny, it has suﬃ-

cient thermal conductivity, and it is commercially available in very thin plates. The current

bolometer substrate is a chemically polished plate (1 cm

1 cm

50 µm) [45]. The heat

capacity of the substrate is probably only a few percent of the total bolometer heat capacity
10−8 J/K at 350 mK), which is likely dominated by amorphous graphite patches

(Fig. 2.2(a)) and the superﬂuid ﬁlm which is ubiquitous in the trapping cell. The time res-

olution of the bolometer is limited ultimately by the time it takes for heat deposited at one

point on its surface to spread throughout its bulk. An upper limit on the time constant for

this spreading, τs, is obtained by dividing the heat capacity by the thermal conductivity

between two edges of the quartz plate. At a typical operating temperature of 350 mK, the

result is τs < 40 µs. A detection bandwidth of several kilohertz has been demonstrated

with the bolometer described here. For most measurements, however, a low-pass ﬁlter is

used to suppress 60 Hz and other noise pickup in the sensitive bolometer circuit.

A physical mask was made for the electrode pattern by cutting an aperture in

a thin metal plate and soldering three

38 µm diameter wires across the aperture. An

∼

evaporator was used to deposit 5 nm of chromium followed by 100 nm of gold onto the

quartz. The resulting pattern is shown in Fig. 2.2(a). Electrical leads were bonded to the

gold pads using silver epoxy to establish good electrical contact, while droplets of Stycast

1266 epoxy [46] near the edge of the plate provided a strong mechanical bond between the

leads and the quartz (see Fig. 2.2(b)). To avoid adding unnecessary heat capacity to the

bolometer in the form of excess epoxy, the droplets were applied with the end of a ﬁne wire.

To minimize the thermal link between bolometer and cell, 30 µm diameter superconducting

NbTi ﬁlaments were used as electrical leads. These ﬁlaments were obtained by dissolving

the copper matrix of a multi-ﬁlament magnet wire in nitric acid.

Across the gaps between gold pads, amorphous graphite resistors were deposited

by repeated applications of Aerodag [47]. The graphite patches have resistances of 1-2 kΩ

at room temperature, but increase to several tens of kΩ below 300 mK. In practice, only

two electrical connections and one resistor is used at a time; the others provide redundancy

in case of a failure. As explained below, the resistor serves as both temperature sensor and

The quartz plate was laid across two nylon threads, about 10 µm in diameter,

which were stretched taut across a G-10 cradle piece having the same radius of curvature as

the inside of the cell. Small drops of Stycast 1266 were allowed to wick along the threads,

providing a large-surface-area bond between the threads and quartz plate. The G-10 cradle

was then mounted by epoxy on the cell wall so that the bolometer sits vertically below the

magnetic trap.

2.3.2 Operation

In typical operation, the bolometer is held at a temperature between 200 mK

and 350 mK, considerably above the cell wall temperature in the later stages of the trap
cycle.2 The bolometer acts as a “thermistor” in a resistance bridge feedback circuit; its

temperature setpoint is determined by a variable resistor outside of the cryostat. A signal

is derived by amplifying the changes in feedback voltage required to hold the bolometer at

constant temperature. This feedback mode of operation allows for much higher linearity

and bandwidth than simply monitoring changes in the bolometer resistance. Diﬀerent

temperature setpoints are selected depending on the type of bolometric measurement; the

bolometer is more sensitive at lower temperatures because heat capacity is lower, and the

temperature coeﬃcient of its resistance is larger.

The primary purpose of the bolometer in our apparatus is to detect the recombi-

nation heat released when atoms from the trap are allowed to reach the cell wall or spin-ﬂip

at a zero of the magnetic ﬁeld. The resulting H2 molecules retain much of the 4.6 eV re-

combination energy in their rovibrational degrees of freedom [48]. Since the molecules are

insensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld, they bounce freely around the cell, transferring some of

their energy in collisions with surfaces. In this way, a small fraction of the recombination

energy reaches the bolometer. Doyle estimated this fraction to be 4

2.3.3 Density Measurements

As mentioned in Sec. 2.2, the relative number of atoms in the trap can be deter-

mined by dumping the atoms from the trap and integrating the bolometer signal. Since the

atom number after loading and evaporation processes is reproducible to a few percent in

successive trap cycles, it is possible to map out the decay curve of an equilibrium sample

by waiting diﬀerent lengths of time before dumping. From the local equation for dipolar

it is possible to derive the following equation involving atom number N1S as a function of

accounting for the fact that some evaporation must occur simultaneously with dipolar decay

if the sample is in equilibrium. More speciﬁcally, ξ represents the ratio of elastic collisions to

inelastic collisions, and f is the fraction of elastic collisions which result in an atom leaving

the trap.

Equation 2.2 describes the time-dependence of the inverse normalized atom num-

ber, N1S(0)/N1S (t). This can be determined from integrated bolometer signals without

knowing the bolometer detection eﬃciency. As shown in Fig. 2.3, the inverse atom number

has a linear time dependence, characteristic of two-body decay. The slope of N1S(0)/N1S (t)

can be used to determine the initial density n1S,o assuming the other quantities are well

known. The theoretical value of g is believed accurate to better than 10% [49]. Furthermore,

the ratio Q1S/V1S can be calculated numerically from the known geometry of the magnets

to about 10%. The uncertainty stems from both imperfect knowledge of the trapping ﬁeld

and uncertainty in the sample temperature.

From thermodynamic considerations, it can be shown that the evaporation cor-

This expression is believed accurate to a few percent for all but the coldest samples in the

MIT hydrogen experiment. (An alternative approach to calculating the correction factor is

outlined in [51, 39]). Depending on η, which generally decreases as the sample temperature

decreases, the evaporation correction amounts to a 10-20% reduction in the apparent density.

The uncertainties in g, the evaporation correction factor, and the eﬀective volumes

are the dominant contributions to the error in ground state density measurements. By

adding these contributions in quadrature, the total uncertainty is estimated to be about

20%.

2.4 Loading the Magnetic Trap

Over the past several years, a number of studies have been undertaken to better

understand what is arguably the most physically complex stage of the trapping cycle: the

loading phase. The goal of these studies has been to understand what limits the number of

atoms which can be accumulated in our trap. This section summarizes the current state of

knowledge about the physics of hydrogen trap loading, highlighting our recent investigations.

The loading phase can be divided into two parts: accumulation and thermal dis-

connect. In preparation for accumulation, the largest of the computer-controlled magnets

are ramped to maximum current, generating a 0.6 K deep Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap. At this

time, a “loading magnet” is energized to prevent the existence of a zero ﬁeld region near

the lower end of the trapping cell (Figs. 2.4 and 2.5). In the next few seconds, the cell is

heated above 300 mK by heaters inside the superﬂuid helium jacket, making the cell walls

less “sticky.” At this temperature, atoms are adsorbed on the helium ﬁlm for less than 1 µs

before returning to the gas [29]. (The binding energy for hydrogen atoms on superﬂuid

helium is about 1 K [52]). Once the cell is suﬃciently warm, discharge pulses begin puﬃng

atoms into the trapping cell, at a typical pulse rate of 50 Hz. The atoms thermalize with the

walls and explore the entire cell volume. The population of d-state atoms in the magnetic

trap region grows to a saturation value. While the discharge pulses feed this population, a

number of loss processes can occur, including dipolar decay and other two-body inelastic

collisions in the gas, one-body spin-ﬂips on the cell walls, and two-body recombination on

the walls. As will be explained below, however, most of these processes can be ruled out as

the limiting factor in determining how many atoms are trapped.

When accumulation is complete, the cell heater is switched oﬀ, and the cell temper-

ature drops below 150 mK in about 2 s. After about 10 s, the temperature reaches 100 mK.

During the rapid cooldown, the ﬂux of atoms to the wall from the magnetic trap minimum

decreases. However, the residence time of atoms on the walls dramatically increases, and

the relatively slow wall loss processes begin to remove atoms with enough energy to reach

the wall. When the cell passes through a temperature of roughly 150 mK, the magnetically

trapped sample thermally disconnects from the walls; the probability of atoms returning

from the walls goes to zero. Meanwhile, the sample continues to cool by evaporation of

atoms to the walls, and its temperature drops below the wall temperature. In a typical

trap cycle, the loading magnet is ramped down simultaneously with thermal disconnect,
1014 atoms equilibrate

and evaporation over the magnetic saddlepoint begins. About 1

The primary means for studying the loading process is to introduce variations in

the sequence and observe the eﬀect on atom number. The atoms can be dumped directly

from the initial deep magnetic trap and detected on the bolometer.

2.4.1 Pulsed Discharge

The 300 MHz discharge resonator currently in use is described by Killian [1].

Several studies were performed to optimize the duty cycle, pulse length, and rf power

parameters of the discharge. These studies show that all of these parameters can be varied

over a wide range without changing the saturation atom number by more than a few percent.

The time constant for reaching saturation, however, depends on the average power supplied

to the discharge.

For constant rf power, it was found that larger duty cycles result in more atoms

trapped per unit energy supplied to the discharge. An energy eﬃcient discharge is desir-

able since it requires less heat to be removed from the copper resonator by the dilution

refrigerator. As will be explained in Sec. 2.4.4, maximum cooling power is desired during

thermal disconnect. Very short (< 100 µs) discharge pulses are ineﬃcient because it takes

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

25

15-25 µs for the discharge to start ﬁring after the beginning of each rf pulse. The energy

deposited in the resonator during this time heats the fridge but does not produce atoms.

The reason for this “dead time” may be that suﬃcient helium vapor pressure must develop

in the resonator before discharge activity can begin.

Some eﬀort was expended to optimize the shape of the rf pulses. An rf switching

scheme was used to apply two diﬀerent power levels, a lower level during the dead time

(25 µs) and a 5-9 dB higher level during the ﬁring time (100 µs-10 ms) of each pulse. Typical

peak powers at the ampliﬁer output driving the discharge were 50-100 W, applied at duty
cycles of 0.5-5%.3 The bolometer was used to record atom pulses as the discharge was ﬁring.

Also, studies were made of the trapped atom number as a function of accumulation time.

A number of diﬀerent pulse lengths and power levels were tried. Although the size of the

atom pulses scaled linearly with the product of RF power and ﬁring time, it was found that

almost regardless of pulse characteristics the trapped atom number after thermal disconnect

saturated at nearly the same value. A couple conclusions were drawn from these studies.

First, the trapped atom number is not limited by the number of atoms produced in a single

discharge pulse. Second, since we were unable to trap more atoms using attenuated rf power

during the dead time of each pulse, it seems that overheating of the resonator is not the

number-limiting factor. The power switching scheme provided no clear advantage.

Even though the saturation atom number is not better, a high average ﬂux from

the discharge is desirable because it shortens the accumulation time. This means less total

heat is required to hold the cell at its relatively high accumulation temperature; after

the loading phase the cell can more quickly reach a cold temperature advantageous for

sensitive bolometric detection. For the experiments described in the remainder of this

thesis, discharge parameters were chosen which loaded the trap 3-4 times faster than in

the initial nonmetallic cell experiments. Typically, the discharge operates with 1 ms pulses

repeated at 50 Hz for a total of 8 s. The peak power of the (square) rf pulses at the ampliﬁer

output is

90 W.

∼
A suﬃcient helium ﬁlm thickness is important for eﬃcient loading of the trap from

the discharge. If the the ﬁlm is too thin, bare spots can form in the cell and resonator while

the discharge ﬁres. The bare spots serve as sticky sites where atoms spin-ﬂip and recombine.

The discharge itself can become erratic with a very thin ﬁlm, probably due to low vapor

pressure in the resonator.

3These values imply average powers far greater than can be tolerated by the dilution refrigerator. Since
less than 10% of the power is reﬂected from the resonator, most of the rf power must be dissipated in parts
of the apparatus not thermally anchored to the dilution refrigerator.

26

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

2.4.2 The Accumulating Sample

The discharge injects a ﬂux of both high ﬁeld and low ﬁeld seekers into the trapping
cell. The average ﬂux (counting only d states) is more than 1013 atoms/s, and a single 1 ms
pulse may inject nearly 1012 atoms. The high ﬁeld seeking a and b states are eventually

pulled back toward the 2.7 K source ﬁeld (Fig. 2.5), though this can take some time if they

reach the trap region and equilibrate with the wall. In the trap region, the gradient in z is

low, and high ﬁeld seekers bounce randomly on the cell wall until reaching the high gradient

in z. From the ratio of the cell wall area in this region to the cell cross-section, we can

estimate that the the atoms must bounce 25 times before leaving the low-gradient region.

At 300 mK, the average time between bounces is about 1 ms, implying a time constant of
τhf ∼
relatively high ﬁeld at the opposite end of the trap may linger there and take even longer

25 ms for high ﬁeld seekers to return to the source. High ﬁeld seekers reaching the

to return. In the meantime, the high ﬁeld seekers can undergo hyperﬁne-changing collisions

with d atoms, potentially causing trap loss.

The other low ﬁeld seekers, c-state atoms, disappear due to spin exchange collisions

on a time scale of seconds. As a result, the sample becomes purely d-state within seconds

after the end of accumulation.

Some insight was gained from studies in which the bolometer was deliberately

made bare of helium ﬁlm for a time during or after accumulation. This was accomplished

by applying several hundred microamps to the bolometer. When the bolometer was bare

throughout accumulation, the number of atoms loaded into the trap was reduced by nearly

two orders of magnitude. What is more, the number remaining depended on the magnetic

potential Ebolo at the bolometer, which sits at approximately z =

23 cm in the coordinate

−

system of the Figures. We varied Ebolo using the loading magnet current. Under the as-

sumption that the bare bolometer surface was the dominant loss mechanism during loading,

the dependence of the atom number on Ebolo was found roughly consistent with a thermally

distributed sample at the cell temperature. Furthermore, it was found that the sample could

be depleted by baring the bolometer at a time long after the discharge stopped ﬁring as long

as the cell temperature was maintained. If the bolometer was not bared, then the sample

could be held at the cell temperature for 30 s or more after accumulation without signiﬁcant

depletion. Finally, if the cell was allowed to cool after accumulation, a subsequent baring

of the bolometer had no eﬀect on the atom number. This was interpreted as a signature of

thermal disconnect.

These observations provided evidence that the assumption of the accumulating

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

27

sample being in equilibrium at the cell temperature is a good one. In addition, we found

evidence that the peak trap density reaches a saturation value during accumulation which

is too low for signiﬁcant loss due to dipolar decay. Since the evaporation process during

thermal disconnect is believed to be well understood (Sec. 2.4.4), measurements of atom

number following thermal disconnect allow an order of magnitude estimate of the sample

density before thermal disconnect. These measurements led to the conclusion that the
1012 cm−3), at which the decay time due to dipolar decay is

peak loading density is (

∼

many minutes. The fact that the atom number after thermal disconnect does not change

appreciably when the atoms are held for many seconds at the loading temperature following

accumulation also suggests a low density at the end of accumulation. This would mean that

the key limiting process during loading occurs in the accumulation phase. However, in the

absence of more direct measurements of the density before thermal disconnect, we admit the

possibility that an unknown process during thermal disconnect may cap the atom number

at a deﬁnite maximum.

If indeed the sample can be held in thermal contact with the walls for many seconds

without loss, an implication is that surface loss processes at the cell loading temperature

are not important for a d-state sample.

In other words, one-body spin ﬂip and surface

recombination are not limiting processes during accumulation.

Since the bolometer is the most poorly thermally anchored part of the trapping

cell, there was some concern that the bolometer was heating enough to become bare while

the discharge was ﬁring even under normal circumstances. This possibility was ruled out

by the bare bolometer studies.

One unexpected observation was that the time to reach saturation number in

the trap was unaﬀected by the bare bolometer. This implies that there is another loss

mechanism other than the bare bolometer which was determining the saturation atom

number in the above studies.

2.4.3 Phenomenological Model

We will assume for the moment that the most important loss mechanism occurs

during accumulation. The fact that the saturation atom number is independent of discharge

pulse parameters suggests a phenomenological model for trap loading which involves a loss

rate proportional to the discharge ﬂux. Consider the simple model

dNd

βFdNd,

(2.5)

28

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

where Nd is the number of d atoms in the trap, Fd is the average ﬂux of d atoms from

the discharge, including d atoms resulting from hyperﬁne-changing collisions, and β is a

proportionality constant for the dominant loss mechanism. The solution to Eq. 2.5 is

Nd(t) =

(2.6)

The saturation time constant τsat = (βFd)−1 depends inversely on the average ﬂux, consis-
tent with data from discharge parameter studies. In addition, the saturation value depends

only on β and not the ﬂux. The question remains: what physical process gives rise to β?

One candidate is the inelastic collisions between d atoms and high ﬁeld seekers

in the thermal gas during the time τhf after a discharge pulse (Sec. 2.4.2). According

to theoretical calculations [40], there are several b + d inelastic processes with large cross

sections. The channels b + d

a + d processes have not been calculated at ﬁnite temperature, but in the zero temperature

source of loss, the local rate of d-state density change due to collisions with high ﬁeld seekers

b + d collisions in the gas probably do not cause the observed saturation of Nd.

Inelastic c + d collisions are another possibility. However, the rate coeﬃcients for

c + d channels are probably far smaller than the c + c channels which remove c atoms from

the trap. At zero temperature, the sum of theoretical c + d rate coeﬃcients is comparable

to the sum of rate coeﬃcients for d + d processes, which are known not to cause signiﬁcant

loss during loading.

is given by

Not only the gas densities but also the surface densities of the four hyperﬁne states

should be proportional to the discharge ﬂux. For state i, the equilibrium surface density σi

σi = ni,wλdBeEb/kT ,

(2.10)

where ni,w is the gas density of species i near the wall, λdB is the thermal deBroglie wave-

length, and Eb is the binding energy on the ﬁlm. Can inelastic processes on the helium

surface give rise to the loss term in the phenomenological model? Loading studies with

diﬀerent ﬁlm thicknesses have shown that as long as the helium ﬁlm is not too thin, the

saturation atom number is about the same. Since changing the ﬁlm thickness changes the

binding energy of the hydrogen atoms on the surface, the rate of surface collisions should be

aﬀected by changing the ﬁlm thickness. Thus, it also seems unlikely that inelastic surface

collisions limit the atom number.

Another idea for a loss mechanism proportional to discharge ﬂux is that high

energy particles from the discharge knock d atoms out of the trap. The discharge likely

produces many other species besides the 1S hyperﬁne states of H. These could include

metastable H, excited states of He, molecular states of H, and various ions. As these other

species stream through the trapping region, they could cause loss of d states.

To see if direct ﬂux from the discharge causes loss, in one experimental run a series

of baﬄes was installed in the opening between the discharge resonator and cell volume. The

30

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

baﬄes were made of copper and were thermally anchored to the copper resonator. They were

constructed such that any particles leaving the discharge would have to bounce several times

on a cold, helium-covered surface before entering the cell. Most of the species mentioned

above would not be able to bounce because of their relatively large surface binding energies.

Furthermore, any particles streaming into the cell would have energies determined by the

cold baﬄes rather than the discharge. The trap loading behavior was found, however, to

be very similar to loading without the baﬄes. The maximum number of atoms loaded was

again the same. We concluded that energetic particles from the discharge were not limiting

the atom number.

Since the baﬄes were located in a high ﬁeld gradient, the baﬄe studies also pro-

vided experimental evidence that high ﬁeld seekers do not cause signiﬁcant loss during

loading. The baﬄes should have prevented most high ﬁeld seekers from reaching the trap,

and yet the saturation behavior of loading was unchanged.

2.4.4 Thermal Disconnect

Some light was shed on the physics of thermal disconnect by holding the cell at

various temperatures following accumulation and observing the eﬀect on atom number.

The typical hold time was 30 s. A dip in the atom number was consistently observed at

hold temperatures between 100 and 200 mK (See Fig. 2.6). This dip was interpreted as
the crossover between the residence time on the surface, which varies as eEb/kTwall and the
ﬂux of atoms to the wall, which varies as n1S,oT 1/2e−Uwall/kTatoms. Since the temperature
of the atoms tracks with the temperature of the cell before thermal disconnect, there is

a temperature range where signiﬁcant numbers of atoms can be depleted by surface loss

processes since the wall is sticky and the ﬂux to the wall from the sample is signiﬁcant.

At higher temperatures, the residence times on the wall are shorter, and the wall is less

lossy. At lower temperatures, the wall is so sticky that eﬃcient evaporation is initiated, and

Tatoms quickly falls below Twall, resulting in thermal disconnect. Thus, the dips in Fig. 2.6

are believed to be closely associated with the temperature at which thermal disconnect

occurs.

The binding energy Eb of H on a helium ﬁlm is a function of the ﬁlm thickness.

For a very thin ﬁlm, Eb can be much larger than 1 K because H atoms on the surface can

interact with the substrate. For a thin ﬁlm and larger Eb, the wall becomes sticky at a

higher temperature, and the dip should occur at a higher temperature. Furthermore, for

a given hold time, it is reasonable to expect the fractional depletion of the sample to be

larger since a larger fraction of atoms have energies large enough to reach the wall. These

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

31

Figure 2.6: Relative number of atoms trapped as a function of the cell setpoint temperature
following accumulation with diﬀerent helium ﬁlm thicknesses. For the warmer points, the
setpoint was reached within a few seconds and maintained until 30 s after the end of
accumulation. For the coldest points, the setpoint was not reached until the latter part of
the 30 s post-accumulation period. Since the bolometer sensitivity was diﬀerent for each
ﬁlm thickness, each curve has been normalized to the lowest temperature point.

qualitative trends can be observed in Fig. 2.6. In principle, it should be possible to derive

quantitative information about Eb from such data, but this has not been attempted.

One conclusion drawn from the temperature setpoint studies is that to maximize

atom number, it is crucial to cool the cell as quickly as possible through the temperature

range where signiﬁcant depletion occurs. This underscores the importance of reducing

the heat deposited during accumulation to a manageable level. For this reason also, it is

important to have a dilution refrigerator with ample cooling power.

For the sake of completeness, it should also be mentioned that a number of loading
studies were performed with about 1 part 3He to 3 parts 4He in the cell. The presence of
3He reduces the binding energy of the ﬁlm [53], and, for a given temperature, increases

the vapor pressure in the cell. Accumulation was optimized at a lower cell temperature

than before, presumably because of the higher vapor pressure. Bolometric detection was

impaired, however, and it was only possible to determine that the maximum number of
atoms loaded was the same as without 3He to within a factor of 2.

32

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

2.4.5 Trap Loading: Conclusion

The constancy of the number of atoms loaded is probably the most remarkable

feature of the trap loading process. The saturation number does not change for wide vari-

ations in the ﬁlm thickness, discharge parameters, cell temperature, and the nature of the

conduit between discharge and magnetic trap. Our studies have enabled us to rule out a

number of possible loss mechanisms as the limiting factor in loading. A phenomenological

model involving a loss term proportional to discharge ﬂux is consistent with our observa-

tions, but a physical model remains elusive. Although several aspects of loading are now

better understood, we still do not know what process causes the atom number to saturate.

To trap more atoms, it may be necessary to increase the eﬀective trap volume, which will

require a new magnet system design.

2.5 UV Laser System

Excitation on the 1S-2S transition in H requires a powerful, frequency-stable

source of 243 nm radiation.

In order to achieve the high excitation rates necessary to

observe two-body metastable H eﬀects, UV power on the order of 10 mW is required. To

suﬃciently resolve the Doppler-free spectrum at typical sample temperatures and densities,

the UV laser linewidth must be no more than a few kilohertz. With currently available

laser technology, these requirements are best satisﬁed by frequency doubling the output of

a 486 nm dye laser which is locked to a stable frequency reference. Following the design

of H¨ansch and co-workers [54], Sandberg [36] and Cesar [38] developed such a system at

MIT; further improvements were introduced by Killian [1]. The remainder of this section

describes the UV laser system of the Ultracold Hydrogen Group as used for measurements

in this thesis.

2.5.1 System Overview

Stable, narrowband light originates in a 486 nm dye laser (Fig. 2.7), which is a

modiﬁed Coherent 699 system [55]. The dye solution is circulated at a pressure of 8 bar by

a high pressure circulation system purchased from Radiant Dyes [56]. A dye jet of 200 µm

thickness is produced using a polished stainless steel nozzle from the same manufacturer.

An intracavity EOM allows for high-bandwidth locking of the laser frequency. When fresh

dye solution is pumped by 4 W of violet from a Krypton ion laser, around 650 mW of single-

frequency output power is obtained. This power is more than 3 times the speciﬁcation for

an unmodiﬁed commercial system.

Frequency stability is achieved by locking the dye laser to a Fabry-Perot reference

cavity by the Pound-Drever-Hall phase modulation technique [57]. The cavity, which has

a spacer made of zerodur glass, is enclosed in a temperature-stabilized vacuum chamber.

It has a free spectral range of 598 MHz and a linewidth of about 600 kHz. When locked

to the reference cavity, the laser has a linewidth of about 1 kHz at 486 nm. The reference

cavity has a long term drift rate of less than 1 MHz per week.

For ﬁnding the cavity resonance closest to the H 1S-2S frequency, the absorption

spectrum of a temperature-stablized Te2 gas cell serves as an absolute frequency reference.

Precise tuning of the laser frequency is achieved by locking the ﬁrst order diﬀraction beam

from an AOM to the cavity. The AOM drive frequency, which is the oﬀset frequency between

laser and cavity, is determined by a high resolution frequency synthesizer. By saturated

absorption spectroscopy of a speciﬁc Te2 line [58, 36, 1], the dye laser can be tuned to within

several hundred kilohertz of the 1S-2S frequency.

Most of the 486 nm laser power is coupled into a bow-tie enhancement cavity where

the blue light is frequency doubled in a 10 mm long Brewster-cut BBO crystal [36]. The

H¨ansch-Couillaud [59] scheme is used to lock the cavity in resonance with the incoming blue

light. An enhancement factor of 100 is achieved, resulting in circulating powers as high as

50 W. More than 40 mW of 243 nm light can be generated by this doubling cavity. Due

to the large walk-oﬀ angle of BBO, the UV is generated in a highly astigmatic transverse

mode.

in a telescope for low-divergence propagation to the cryostat, which is 30 m away in a

diﬀerent laboratory. As shown in Fig. 2.8, the beam passes through another telescope

near the cryostat before propagating into the dilution refrigerator. A lens on top of the

discharge resonator brings the beam to a focus near the magnetic trap minimum. A concave

retromirror glued to the MgF2 window at the bottom of the trapping cell reﬂects the beam

onto itself, producing the standing wave conﬁguration necessary for Doppler-free two-photon

excitation of the 1S-2S transition.

Since the cryostat is located in a diﬀerent lab, an active beam steering system is

required to maintain a steady pointing of the beam into Telescope 2 (see Fig. 2.8). The

beam steering system, which consists of a position sensing photodiode, a servo circuit,

and a mirror mounted on piezoelectric transducers (PZT’s), is necessary to compensate for

relative motion of the laser table and cryostat and for UV pointing variations due to dye

laser pointing instability. The PZT-mounted mirror is 12.7 mm in diameter and 6.4 mm

thick. It was mounted using a 5-minute epoxy on a fulcrum and two low voltage PZT stacks

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

35

[60]; the PZT’s cause deﬂection in orthogonal directions. We have found this construction

to be mechanically robust. In previous incarnations, much thinner (1-2 mm) and lighter

mirrors were used to maximize PZT bandwidth. However, the stress on these thin mirrors

caused signiﬁcant distortion of the UV beam at the cryostat. Furthermore, the distortion

changed constantly as the PZT voltages required to maintain lock drifted on a time scale

of minutes. These problems were eliminated by going to a thicker mirror. The low voltage

PZT’s currently in use have very high resonance frequencies. In spite of the relatively large

mass of the mirror, a servo bandwidth of several kilohertz is achieved.

To ensure a good overlap of incoming and return beams at the atoms, the position

of the return beam is monitored on a ﬂuorescent aperture near the beam steering mirror.

The aperture is just large enough to allow the incoming beam to pass through without

diﬀraction eﬀects. While spectroscopy is in progress, the return beam alignment on the

aperture is monitored from the cryostat lab via video camera. If the return beam is not

centered on the aperture, corrections are made by micromotor translation of one of the

Telescope 2 lenses.

The UV beam immediately following the astigmatism compensation optics is

nearly square in shape. After propagating nearly 30 m to Telescope 2, the transverse

mode consists of a bright central lobe ﬂanked by a series of weaker lobes. The outer lobes

are cut oﬀ by an iris aperture in Telescope 2. The remaining transverse mode structure is a

slightly astigmatic Gaussian beam. By adjusting the length of Telescope 1, more than 60%

of the power after Telescope 1 remains after the aperture in Telescope 2. The UV power

reaching the atoms is typically 10-20 mW.

In previous spectroscopic experiments with our apparatus, the beam waist near

the atoms had a radius of

50 µm. For BEC experiments, it was desirable to employ a

∼

tighter focus, since the excitation rate for nearly motionless condensate atoms should scale

with the square of laser intensity. It was also desirable to change the size of the waist to

study the eﬀects of laser geometry on the 1S-2S lineshape. For these reasons, the length

of Telescope 2 was reduced, resulting in a waist radius of about 21 µm and a Rayleigh

range of 6 mm. These values are calculated by using previously determined Gaussian beam

parameters for the input to Telescope 2 and adjusting the length of the telescope for perfect

overlap of incoming and return beam modes. In the case of perfect overlap, the position

of the waist in the cell is ﬁxed by the radius of curvature of the retromirror. If there is a

small mismatch between incoming and return modes, then the incoming and return waists

are slightly separated on the trap axis, with the midpoint between waists located at the

waist position of ideal overlap. To optimize overlap, the spot sizes of the incoming and

counts is recorded while translating the atoms in a raster pattern with respect to the laser
beam. The laser frequency is detuned to the red such that atoms from the central, densest

this example, the sample is slightly oﬀset from the center of the scan range.

return beams are viewed on a folding mirror in Telescope 2, and the length of the telescope

is adjusted until they are the same.

Good alignment of the laser beam with the center of the atom cloud is essential for

high signal rates and reproducible results. An eﬀective method was developed for achieving

this alignment. In our magnet system, there are four “racetrack” quadrupole coils which

give rise to the radial conﬁning ﬁeld of the trap. By adding a small trim current to one

coil in each pair of opposing quadrupole coils, it is possible to precisely displace the trap

minimum in both directions perpendicular to the trap axis. By placing the trim current in

both coils under computer control, it is possible to move the atom cloud rapidly in a lateral

raster pattern while exciting the atoms at a constant laser frequency. The resulting plot of

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

excitation signal as a function of trim currents is a kind of spatial image of the atom cloud

(Fig. 2.9). From such a “lateral scan” image, the trim currents can be chosen which center

the atom cloud on the laser beam. In addition, if the laser beam axis intersects the trap

axis at a signiﬁcant angle, a highly elliptical distribution results; the lateral scan is a useful

diagnostic for overlapping the laser and trap axes.

2.6 Data Acquisition

2.6.1 Lyman-α Detection

The metastables excited in our trap are detected by applying an electric ﬁeld of

about 10 V/cm, which quenches them within a few microseconds. The detection eﬃciency

for the resulting Lyman-α photons is small, however. Due to the closed geometry of the

magnet system, the MCP detector sits beyond the lower end of the trapping cell, about
10−2 sr.

absorption on window surfaces and sub-optimal MCP quantum eﬃciency. Futhermore, at

typical 1S densities up to 30% of the Lyman-α ﬂuorescence in the detection solid angle is

scattered into other directions before it can escape the sample. A discussion of this radiation

trapping eﬀect will be presented in Sec. 3.6.

2.6.2 Microchannel Plate Detector

The microchannel plates in the current detector are similar to those described by

Killian [1]. In previous work, a Lyman-α ﬁlter was used to prevent the detector from being

saturated by scatter from the 243 nm laser. The transmission of the ﬁlter at 122 nm was

only 10%, however. To increase the signal detection eﬃciency by a factor of 4, the Lyman-α

ﬁlter was replaced by a MgF2 window, and a switching scheme was developed which turns

on the gain of the upper MCP plate only long enough to detect the Lyman-α ﬂuorescence

at each quench pulse.

The relevant circuit diagrams are given in Fig. 2.10. A triac switch, whose state

is governed by a digital signal, allows the voltage across the upper plate to be switched

before the laser excitation phase of the trap cycle and turned oﬀ afterwards.

2.6.3 Data Acquisition Electronics

An overview of the data acquisition system is given in Fig. 2.11. The sequence

of events during a trap cycle is determined by a program running on a CAMAC crate

computer. When the laser excitation phase begins, a mechanical shutter near the cryostat

entrance window opens, and laser pulses are allowed to trigger a timing generator with 8

output channels and sub-microsecond resolution. The timing generator allows precise timing

control of the MCP switch and quench (electric ﬁeld) pulses with respect to the excitation

pulses. It also gates four counters to count MCP pulses when signal is present. When the

timing generator sequence is ﬁnished, the CAMAC computer reads out the counters, the

counters are reset, and the timing generator waits to be triggered by the next laser pulse.

40

Chapter 2: Apparatus and Experimental Techniques

2.6.4 Metastable Decay Measurements

Figure 2.12 shows the timing sequence used for the decay measurements described

in Ch. 4. The sequence determines wait times for quench pulses following four consecutive

laser pulses. Each quench pulse lasts for 90 µs, and a counter is gated on for the ﬁrst 40 µs

of each. The MCP is switched on 1.4 ms before each quench in order to fully charge the

plates. To obtain more time points in a single decay measurement, a delay generator is

enabled before every other trigger, introducing an additional delay between the laser pulse

and the start of the timing sequence. For example, the sequence shown in Fig. 2.12 contains

wait times of 2, 11, 38, and 74 ms (not in this order) after the end of a laser pulse; with

an additional delay of 18 ms before every other trigger, eight consecutive laser pulses are

associated with wait times of 2, 11, 20, 29, 38, 56, 74, and 92 ms. The accuracy of these

delay times is limited by phase jitter in the mechanical chopper used to pulse the laser. In

the worst case, this jitter leads to a 0.4 ms wait time inaccuracy.

Results from a single eight-point decay measurement are shown in Fig. 2.13. The

laser detuning is constant to assure the same metastable density at the beginning of each

decay, and the ground state density does not change appreciably during the 800 ms required

to make the measurement. The nonstatistical scatter, which arises from ﬂuctuations in laser

alignment and power, is typical for a single measurement. To reduce this scatter, many

decay curves made at similar laser detuning and 1S density are averaged together. As will

be explained further in Chapters 4 and 5, the decay curves are analyzed by ﬁtting them

with either a simple exponential or a model including both one-body and two-body decay

terms.

curves.

In the example of Fig. 2.13, the raw data has been corrected for laser-induced back-

ground ﬂuorescence, which has its own characteristic decay behavior (Fig. 2.14). Although
the MCP is 104 times less sensitive to 243 nm than to Lyman-α, ﬂuorescence photons at

243 nm and longer wavelengths are so numerous after each laser pulse that a few give rise

to MCP pulses. The background ﬂuorescence decay is measured at the end of each trap

cycle by detuning the laser far oﬀ resonance and recording decay curves in the manner de-

scribed above. The ﬂuorescence decay can be ﬁt to the sum of a fast exponential component

and a very long-lived component well approximated by a constant over 100 ms. This ﬁt is

used to subtract the background contribution from individual decay curves. For most data,

however, the background correction results in only small changes to the metastable decay

2.6.5 Stray Field Compensation

In the presence of an electric ﬁeld of strength E, metastable H quenches at a rate

γs = 2800E2(cm2/V2)s−1

(2.11)

due to Stark-mixing with the 2P state [61]. To minimize the stray ﬁeld in our apparatus, we

apply a compensation dc oﬀset voltage across the copper ﬁlm electrodes used for detection

quench pulses (Fig. 2.15(a)). The total electric ﬁeld Etot experienced by the atoms is the

sum of applied and stray ﬁelds:

Etot = Ea + Es.

At any given point in space, the rate γs is proportional to

E2

tot = (Ea + Ek)2 + E2
⊥,

(2.12)

(2.13)

where Ek and E⊥ are, respectively, the stray ﬁeld components perpendicular and parallel

to the applied ﬁeld. If both the applied ﬁeld and the stray ﬁeld are nearly uniform over

the atom cloud, then the optimal compensation voltage is the one which gives Ea =

Ek.
In a situation where only one-body loss mechanisms are important, the total decay rate is
the sum of γs, the natural decay rate of 8.2 s−1, and any other one-body rates which may
be present. One-body loss dominates in metastable clouds excited from warm, low-density

−

samples. In this case, Eqs. 2.11 and 2.13 imply a parabolic dependence of the total decay

rate on Ea, as shown in Fig. 2.15(b). The best compensation voltage is determined by ﬁtting

a parabola to the one-body decay rates measured at several dc voltages. The minimum of

the parabola has been found to be stable over several hours.

In the current apparatus, two of the electrodes are hard-wired to the electrical

ground of the cryostat. This means that stray ﬁeld compensation is only possible along one

direction, and there is a residual stray ﬁeld with magnitude E⊥. An upper limit for the
decay rate due to E⊥ is 4 s−1, obtained by subtracting the natural decay rate from the rate
at the parabola minimum. This implies that the residual stray ﬁeld is less than 40 mV/cm.

In future experiments, it should be possible to ﬂoat all four electrodes, allowing

compensation in two dimensions. The stray ﬁeld component in the third dimension, along

the cell axis, is probably very small.

Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

The physics of metastable hydrogen excited in a magnetic trap is potentially very

rich. Metastable H can participate in several types of inelastic collisions, including ones

that result in energetic ions. Diﬀusion is also important. Due to the presence of the 1S

background gas, a metastable cloud does not immediately ﬁll the volume of the ground

state sample, but instead diﬀuses slowly outward from a region deﬁned by the focus of the

excitation laser. In addition, the intense UV radiation can subsequently photoionize many

of the metastables.

This chapter summarizes some of the microscopic and macroscopic physics relevant

to metastable H in a trap. An understanding of this physics is important for both the inter-

pretation of metastable decay measurements described in Ch. 5 as well as the preparation

for future high resolution spectroscopy measurements.

3.1 Collisions between Metastables

Stimulated by our experimental work, theoretical investigations of 2S-2S collisions

were begun recently. Jonsell et al. have calculated the complex interaction potentials be-

tween two metastable hydrogen atoms [62]. Forrey et al. used the potentials to compute

elastic, double excitation transfer, and total ionization cross sections [9]. The initial calcu-

lations neglected the Lamb shift and ﬁne structure, and the results were considered valid

for thermal energies large compared to the splittings between 2S1/2, 2P1/2, and 2P3/2 states
1 K). In the past year, Forrey, Jonsell, and collaborators have included
(that is, for T

≫

the Lamb shift and ﬁne structure in their potentials, allowing the ﬁrst calculations of elastic

and inelastic 2S-2S rate constants down to T = 0 [7]. The eﬀect of the hyperﬁne interaction

has not yet been included, but the rate calculations which neglect hyperﬁne structure are

46

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

47

expected to be accurate to within an order of magnitude [63].

As described in Ch. 1, the trapped metastables are in the d state (F = 1, mF = 1)

of the 2S manifold. Just as with the 1S d-state atoms, dipolar decay collisions can change

the hyperﬁne state of the metastables, causing them to be lost from the trap. The rate

constants for the inelastic d + d channels of the 2S manifold have not been calculated.

However, the approach of Stoof, et al. for 1S dipolar decay collisions [40] is applicable to

the 2S case as well. The rate for 2S dipolar decay is governed by weak magnetic dipole

interactions between atoms. These interactions in the 2S-2S case are similar in strength

to the 1S-1S case, and the corresponding inelastic rates are not expected to diﬀer by more

than an order of magnitude [49]. At the metastable densities achieved in the experiments

described in Ch. 5, 2S dipolar decay should be undetectable.

Several 2S-2S collision processes which may occur in the trap are outlined below

in more detail. Unless denoted otherwise, the label “2S” refers to the magnetically trapped

d state of the 2S manifold.

3.1.1 Summary of 2S-2S Collision Processes

Elastic Collisions.

H(2S) + H(2S)

H(2S) + H(2S).

(3.1)

−→

According to recent theoretical calculations [7], these collisions occur more frequently than

2S-2S inelastic collisions at all temperatures accessible in our trap. However, due to the

fact that the metastable density is several orders of magnitude smaller than the ground

state density, elastic 2S-2S collisions are much less frequent than elastic 1S-2S collisions.

They contribute insigniﬁcantly to the dynamics of the metastable cloud, and they are not

detectable in current experiments.

Excitation Transfer. During a collision between metastables, either one or both of the

atoms may undergo a transition to the 2P state. The processes are formally known as single

excitation transfer,

and double excitation transfer,

H(2S) + H(2S)

H(2P ) + H(2S),

H(2S) + H(2S)

H(2P ) + H(2P ).

−→

−→

(3.2)

(3.3)

These collisions are,

in principle, directly detectable because the 2P products radiate

Lyman-α after a lifetime of 1.6 ns. At high temperatures, where the 2S and 2P levels

48

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

can be considered degenerate, the allowed molecular symmetries for a pair of metastables

do not permit single excitation transfer [9]. Single excitation transfer may be allowed at

low temperatures, but it would require coupling between the orbital angular momentum

of the nuclei and the electronic angular momentum. The calculations of Forrey, et al. to

date have assumed that this coupling is zero. Forthcoming theoretical work will determine

whether this assumption is justiﬁed for spin-polarized metastables [63].

The rate constant for excitation transfer collisions is predicted to be larger than

the rate constant for ionizing collisions at all temperatures.

Ionization. Two types of ionization can occur when metastables collide. One type is

Penning ionization,

H(2S) + H(2S)

H(1S) + H + + e−,

−→

(3.4)

which liberates 6.8 eV (7.9

104 K) of energy. Most of the energy is imparted to the

×

electron, which leaves the trap instantly. A fraction of the energy approximately equal

to me/mp, the electron-to-proton mass ratio, becomes the kinetic energy associated with

the center of mass of the H ion (proton) and ground state atom. This small fraction still

amounts to more than 40 K, and the proton and atom will generally leave the trapped

sample within a couple microseconds. The magnetic ﬁeld at the center of the trap is far too

weak to hold the proton in a cyclotron orbit; the proton will quickly move away from the

trap axis and towards the cell wall, guided by the radially-pointing magnetic ﬁeld of the

quadrupole magnets.

The second type of ionization is associative,

H(2S) + H(2S)

H +

2 + e−.

−→

(3.5)

Between 6.8 eV and 9.45 eV of translational energy is liberated, depending on the rovibra-

tional state of the molecular ion. By arguments similar to those of the preceding paragraph,

both the ion and electron products leave the trap quickly.

The cross section for associative ionization has been measured in beam experiments

for collision energies down to 4.1 meV (48 K) [6]. At this energy, the measured cross

section for associative ionization is 100 times smaller than the theoretical total ionization

cross section [9], indicating that Penning ionization is far more prevalent than associative
ionization. The experiments showed that the associative cross section varied as E−1 at high
temperatures, while theory predicts the total ionization cross section to vary as E−2/3. It has

not yet been established whether Penning ionization also dominates at low temperatures.

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

49

Dipolar Decay. Due to the electron-electron and electron-proton magnetic dipole inter-

actions between two 2S atoms, inelastic collisions can occur in which the sum of magnetic

quantum numbers mF of the two atoms is not conserved. The hyperﬁne state of one or

both atoms can change from d to another hyperﬁne state which is weakly-trapped or anti-

trapped. Under typical trap conditions, enough kinetic energy is liberated in the transition

to eject even the weakly-trapped products from the trap. Very generally, these dipolar

decay transitions can be written

H(2S, d) + H(2S, d)

H(2S, µ) + H(2S, ν),

(3.6)

−→

where at least one of µ and ν is not d. These magnetic interactions are weak compared

to the central forces responsible for other inelastic processes. For ground state H, the sum
10−15 cm3/s across

of rate constants for dipolar decay of d states was determined to be

∼

the range of temperatures and magnetic ﬁelds relevant to hydrogen trapping [40, 64]. The

same order of magnitude is expected for the sum of rates corresponding to Eq. 3.6.

3.1.2 Theoretical Rate Constants

The rate constants for double excitation transfer and ionizing 2S-2S collisions have

recently been calculated down to T = 0 and are summarized in Fig. 3.1. The methods of

calculation are outlined in [9] and a forthcoming paper [7]. For each collision channel i, the
corresponding rate constant Ri is deﬁned such that Rin2
of metastables, is the local rate of collision events of type i.

2S, where n2S is the local density
If we assume that double

excitation transfer and ionization are much more prevalent than other inelastic collisions,

the total two-body loss constant K2 can be expressed

K2 = 2(Ret + Rion),

(3.7)

where Ret and Rion are the rates for double excitation transfer and ionization. The factor

of 2 appears since two metastable atoms are lost from the trap in each collision event.

Chapter 5 describes how K2 was determined experimentally.

As can be seen from Fig. 3.1, below 10−4 K the elastic collision rate varies as T 1/2,

and the inelastic rates are nearly independent of temperature. In this regime, only s-wave

collisions are important, and both the elastic and inelastic collisional behavior of metastable

H are characterized by a single quantity, the complex scattering length a2S−2S. In general,

for a complex s-wave scattering length a = α

iβ involving identical bosons, the elastic

Since metastable hydrogen can be excited at temperatures below 100 µK, our

experiments are able to probe the theoretically predicted Wigner threshold regime.

It

should be noted, however, that even up to temperatures as high as 10 mK, the theoretical

inelastic collision rates do not change by more than a factor of 2.

1For distinguishable particles, the expressions in Eqs. 3.8 and 3.9 are reduced by a factor of 2.

The accuracy of the theoretical rates is diﬃcult to estimate. Hyperﬁne structure

has not yet been included in the calculations, nor an allowance for coupling between elec-

tronic angular momentum and nuclear orbital angular momentum. In addition, the eﬀects

of the trapping magnetic ﬁeld on the collision rates have not been examined. For the mag-

netic ﬁelds of a few gauss experienced by colder samples, the rate constants are predicted

to be accurate to within an order of magnitude.

3.2 Collisions between Metastable and Ground State Atoms

In our experiments, the peak metastable densities are typically three or more

orders of magnitude smaller than the peak ground state density. Although the 1S-2S cross

sections are smaller than the 2S-2S cross sections, the metastables still collide with ground

state atoms much more frequently than with each other. Most of the 1S-2S collisions are

elastic, and most of what has been learned theoretically and experimentally about 1S-2S

interactions so far pertains to elastic collisions.

3.2.1 Elastic 1S-2S Collisions

With the advent of ab initio calculations for the short range 1S-2S molecular po-

tentials, it became possible in the last decade for theorists to predict a1S−2S, the s-wave
elastic scattering length.2 Since 1S-2S collisions are predominantly s-wave at the temper-

atures of magnetically trapped hydrogen, this single parameter is suﬃcient to describe the
elastic collisions. The elastic cross section, σ1S−2S = 4πa2
energy.

1S−2S, is independent of collision

Calculations of a1S−2S depend sensitively on the molecular potential. A ﬁrst calcu-

lation of a1S−2S was made by Jamieson, et al. [3] using the best available ab initio potential

of the time, which extended only to 20 bohr. The result was a1S−2S =

2.3 nm. The accu-

−

racy of this calculation was limited by (1) the mismatch between the short range potential

and the asymptotic long range potential and (2) uncertainty in the very short range part of

the ab initio potential. More recently, Orlikowski and collaborators recalculated the entire

short range potential, extending it to 44 bohr and realizing a much better match to the

long range potential [4]. From their improved potential, they found a1S−2S =

3.0 nm.

−

Although the uncertainty is diﬃcult to estimate [67], this is believed the most accurate

calculation of a1S−2S to date.

2More precisely, a1S−2S denotes here the scattering length corresponding to the e3Σu molecular potential
on which a 1S d-state atom interacts with a 2S d-state atom. Other 1S-2S potentials have been studied as
well, but they are not relevant for the present discussion.

52

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

As mentioned in Ch. 1, there is a density-dependent cold-collision shift of the

1S-2S transition frequency due to the diﬀerence in 1S-2S and 1S-1S interactions. Since the

1S-1S scattering length is theoretically known to be a1S−1S = 0.0648 nm with a relatively

small uncertainty [68], the cold-collision shift parameter χ = ∆E1S−2S/hn1S can be used

to measure a1S−2S provided that the relationship between the shift and scattering lengths

is well understood. According to the arguments given by Killian [1], the energy shift of the

1S-2S transition for homogeneous weak excitation in a homogeneous ground state gas of

density n1S is

∆E1S−2S =

8π¯h2n1S
m

(a1S−2S −

a1S−1S),

(3.11)

where m is the atomic mass. The fact that the two scattering lengths in this formula

are multiplied by the same factor follows from assuming uniform coherent excitation of the

many-body wave function of the ground state gas. The bosonic bunching correlations which

enhance the 1S-1S interactions are maintained as each 1S atom in the many-body wave

function gains 2S character. Eq. 3.11 has been derived by Stoof and Pethick using a micro-

scopic approach [5], and a more general sum rule extension of Eq. 3.11 to inhomogeneous

cases has recently been posited by Oktel and collaborators [69].

If instead we consider

the case where a 2S atom is introduced into a homogeneous 1S gas by means other than

coherent excitation, then Hartree-Fock theory predicts that the energy of the 2S state will

be shifted only half as much; this is because 1S and 2S atoms are distinguishable particles

and, in this case, they are spatially uncorrelated. The energy diﬀerence between the two

states would then be

∆E1S−2S =

4π¯h2n1S
m

(a1S−2S −

2a1S−1S ).

(3.12)

Both Eq. 3.11 and Eq. 3.12 assume that the contributions of inelastic processes to the energy

shifts are negligible.

The MIT Ultracold Hydrogen Group used Eq. 3.11 to determine a1S−2S =

±
0.3 nm from the experimental cold-collision shift [2], which is a factor of two smaller than

1.4

−

the value of Orlikowski, et al. Interestingly, if Eq. 3.12 is used, a1S−2S =

2.9

−

±

obtained, in good agreement with the theoretical value. This suggests that Eq. 3.12 is closer

to the correct description of the cold-collision shift in our experiment. Further support for

this conclusion is provided by recent time-resolved spectroscopic measurements of hydrogen

BEC’s performed in our group [43, 70]. A possible reason why Eq. 3.12 may be favored over

Eq. 3.11 is that 1S-2S collisions occurring during the excitation may destroy the spatial

correlations of the ground state gas. Furthermore, it remains an open question how to

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

correctly describe the cold-collision shift in terms of scattering lengths for the experimentally

realistic case of an inhomogeneous thermal gas and an inhomogeneous laser ﬁeld.

In the remainder of this thesis, the theoretical value of a1S−2S will be assumed

correct. This implies an elastic scattering cross section σ1S−2S = 1.1

×

magnitude of σ1S−2S is important for determining the rate at which metastables can diﬀuse

through the ground state sample.

3.2.2 Inelastic 1S-2S Collisions

At least two types of inelastic collisions are possible between metastables and

ground state H in the trap. First, there is the analog of dipolar decay,

H(1S, d) + H(2S, d)

H(1S, µ) + H(2S, ν),

(3.13)

−→

−→

where at least one of the products is not a d-state. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1.1, these

processes are mediated by weak magnetic dipole forces, and their rates should be small

compared to the important 2S-2S inelastic channels. Second, excitation transfer can occur

as follows:

H(1S) + H(2S)

H(1S) + H(2P ).

(3.14)

To our knowledge, no theoretical work has been done to date on inelastic 1S-2S

collisions. If they occur at signiﬁcant rates in the hydrogen trap, then they should be ob-

servable as one-body metastable decay processes; the decay component would be a simple

exponential since the ground state density does not change appreciably during the meta-

stable lifetime. An upper limit for these rates based on decay measurements is presented

in Ch. 5.

3.3 Photoionization

The 243 nm UV photons which create metastable H can also ionize the metastables

(Fig. 3.2). By cubic interpolation of the tabulated values from Burgess [71], the cross section

constant is αpi = 7.6

10−3 (mW/cm2)−1s−1.

×

At warmer sample temperatures (> 1 mK), the volume of the metastable cloud

which forms during the laser pulse is much larger than the laser beam, and the fraction of

atoms experiencing high laser intensity at any given time is small. As a consequence, only a

small fraction of the metastables are photoionized. In colder samples, however, a signiﬁcant

fraction of the metastables are in the laser ﬁeld. For samples below 100 µK, photoionization

is short compared to the length of the excitation pulse. Since the collision time and radial

transit time are both typically 10 times or more shorter than the pulse length at

100 µK,

∼

this is a good assumption for colder samples (see Sec. 3.4).

To ﬁnd

Fpi, we consider the number of atoms Nz,2S(z, t) in a slice perpendicular

to the trap axis at z with thickness dz. In each slice,

˙Nz,2S(z, t) = R12(z)

(3.15)

where R12(z) is the total rate of metastable generation due to laser excitation, and Φ(z) is

the fraction of metastables which are photoionized per unit time. The distribution R12(z)

can be calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation of excitation described in Sec. 5.3. If

t = 0 corresponds to the beginning of the excitation pulse, the solution to Eq. 3.15 for times

up to the end of the pulse can be written

Nz,2S(z, t) = R12(z)C(z, t)t,

(3.16)

where C(z, t) is a correction factor which expresses the eﬀect of photoionization on the

otherwise linear growth of the metastable population at z. The time-dependent correction

factor is given by

Fpi = 0.28 at 12 mW of UV power and

Fpi = 0.38 at 18 mW. The fraction photionized
has a weak dependence on the beam radius, the laser detuning, and the location of the laser

focus along the trap axis.

At T

100 µK the rate of metastable production in the trap should begin to

∼

saturate due to photoionization after a few milliseconds. This expectation was conﬁrmed

in a preliminary experiment which recorded signal rates in consecutive trap cycles using

diﬀerent pulse lengths (see Fig. 6.2).

A natural question to ask is whether any of the charged particles generated by

photoionization remain in the trap long enough to aﬀect the metastable cloud. If enough

space charge lingers after a laser pulse, the metastables could quench in the resulting electric

ﬁeld. To investigate this, we consider the energy and momentum of the resulting proton-
104 K),

electron pair (see Fig. 3.2). Almost all of the of energy above threshold, 1.7 eV (2.0

×

goes to the electron, causing the electron to leave the trap instantaneously. The proton

recoils with a fraction me/mp of the electron energy, about 0.93 meV (11 K). In the center-

of-mass frame, this recoil is opposite to the direction of electron emission. For an S-

orbital electron, the angular distribution of photoelectric emission is peaked around the

laser polarization axis (see [72], for example). The lab frame does not look much diﬀerent

from the center-of-mass frame, since the initial momenta of the photon and atom are small

compared to the photoionization momentum. In our experiments, the excitation laser is

linearly polarized in a direction perpendicular to the trap axis; this means that the protons

will recoil in a radial direction, exiting the atom cloud in less than 1 µs. Similar to the

case of ion collision products described in Sec. 3.1.1, the protons quickly move into the

quadrupole ﬁeld, where the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the direction of motion. In this

way, the protons leave the trap without causing much loss in the sample.

3.4 Dynamics of the Metastable Cloud

The dynamics of the 2S cloud are more complex than the dynamics of the quasi-

equilibrium 1S cloud. This is because the metastables are excited at the focus of the laser

and spread along the trap axis by diﬀusion. At the densities typical of experiments described

in this thesis, the lifetime of the metastables is much shorter than the time required to

establish equilibrium along the axis.

Since Doppler-free excitation imparts no momentum to an atom, each metastable

atom initally possesses the velocity of the ground state atom from which it was excited.

Diﬀerent velocity classes in the ground state gas have diﬀerent probabilities for excitation,

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

57

however, and it is because 2S atoms collide frequently with 1S atoms that a Maxwell-

Boltzmann velocity distribution is quickly established in the metastable cloud. The 1S-2S

collision time is between 100 µs and 1 ms for typical sample densities, and an equilibrium

velocity distribution is established within a few collision times [73]. Since the mean free
path of the 2S atoms l = (√2n1Sσ1S−2S)−1 is typically comparable to the thermal radius
of the 1S cloud (0.7 mm at 2.5 mK, 0.18 mm at 100 µK), an equilibrium radial spatial

distribution is achieved on a short time scale.

In other words, the radial extent of the

metastable cloud quickly matches the radial extent of the ground state cloud.

Much more time is required for the metastable cloud to spread out to its equilib-

rium extent in the axial direction, however. The metastable cloud is excited in a region

along the trap axis which is deﬁned by the depth of focus of the laser. Initially, the length of

the 2S cloud between its 1/e density points is

2 cm, while the length of the ground state

∼

cloud varies between 4 cm and 24 cm. The distance which 2S atoms must travel along z to

ﬁll up the equilibrium trap volume is more than 100 times longer than a mean free path.

Thus, to approach equilibrium, the metastables must diﬀuse along the trap axis. The time

required is typically much longer than the lifetime of the 2S state.

If we neglect for the moment 2S-2S inelastic collisions, a metastable cloud excited
from a ground state sample with peak density of at least a few times 1013 cm−3 will have

a quasi-static spatial distribution. This is because (1) the metastable cloud is axially con-

ﬁned by 1S-2S collisions and (2) radial equilibrium is maintained over the lifetime of the

metastable cloud. To examine the transport of the cloud more generally, we must consider

the diﬀusion of 2S atoms in a 1S background gas.

To accurately describe the time evolution of the metastable distribution, the

density-dependent losses due to 2S-2S inelastic collisions must also be considered. The

eﬀects of diﬀusion and two-body losses on the metastable cloud shape have been studied

using a dynamic simulation described in Sec. 5.5.3. One of the inputs to this simulation is a

parameter describing the rate of diﬀusion along the trap axis; the remainder of this section

summarizes an approach for determining the diﬀusion parameter.

3.4.1 Diﬀusion Constant

From the results of a hard-sphere kinetic theory, the diﬀusion constant for a dilute

gas of one species in a background gas of another species with the same atomic mass is

D =

,

(3.20)

58

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

where n is the background gas density, σ is the cross section for collisions between the two
species, and m is the atomic mass [74].4 The dilute gas atoms are here assumed to collide

much more frequently with the background gas atoms than with each other. For the case

of 2S atoms in a 1S gas, Eq. 3.20 becomes

D = 6.1

1015 T 1/2

×

cm−1s−1K−1/2,

where the theoretical value of σ1S−2S has been used.

If the length scales for variations in n1S were much larger than the 2S mean free

path in all directions, then a three-dimensional diﬀusion equation

(3.21)

(3.22)

∇

would describe the transport of the metastables. However, as mentioned above, an equilib-

rium distribution is rapidly established in the radial direction. Futhermore, the 2S atoms

oscillate through the radial density distribution at a frequency comparable to the 1S-2S

collision frequency. A better approach is to ﬁnd the eﬀective diﬀusion constant along the

trap axis as a function of the peak ground state density. In this way, metastable transport

in the trap can be described as a one-dimensional diﬀusion process.

3.4.2 Monte Carlo Diﬀusion Simulation

The rate of diﬀusion in z has been studied by Monte Carlo simulation of metastable

atom trajectories. The computer simulation uses a normally-distributed random number

generator to select the components of an initial 2S atom velocity v from the Maxwell-

Boltzmann distribution. The equations of motion for the atom are integrated in a trap

potential U whose shape is speciﬁed by the sum of an axial bias ﬁeld and a radial ﬁeld

gradient. To simplify the coding, the variation of the trapping ﬁeld in z is neglected.

Collisions are simulated by taking time steps dt much shorter than the average collision

time and using random numbers to test for a collision in each time step. The collision
probability per step is n1Sσ1S−2Sv dt, where n1S = n1S,oe−U/kT . After each collision, a new
random velocity is selected.

Fig. 3.3 shows an example trajectory calculated in this way. In a typical simula-

tion, 1000 such trajectories are generated, each covering a period of tens of milliseconds.

Statistics are collected for the trajectories, including the distribution of distances traveled in

z (Fig. 3.4). The rms width of the distribution, σz, serves as a measure of the characteristic
4More sophisticated diﬀusion theories lead to a constant which is about 10% smaller [75, 76]. However,

Eq. 3.20 is suﬃciently accurate for the arguments presented here.

3.5 Fluorescence in a Quenching Field

For the measurements in this thesis, metastables were detected by applying a

quenching electric ﬁeld and observing the Lyman-α ﬂuorescence. The recoil energy associ-

ated with this photon is 670 µK. Whether or not the recoiling atom leaves the trap depends

on the depth of the trap and the ground hyperﬁne state into which the atom decays. The

relevant traps in Ch. 5 are all deeper than the recoil energy for the

state, but not for

the weakly-trapped

state. Generally speaking, atoms returning to the

state in

polarization of a photon emitted in a transition between speciﬁc 2P and 1S hyperﬁne states

is determined by the change in mL represented in the contributing dipole matrix element.
The relative probabilities of obtaining π, σ+, and σ− polarization as a function of γ are

summarized in Table 3.1. The dipole radiation patterns with respect to the orientation of B

depend on the polarization (Table 3.2) [77]. For a quenched metastable, taking into account

the probability of emitting into each polarization, the angular probability distribution of

ﬂuorescence is shown in Fig. 3.5 for the limiting cases of γ = π/2 and γ = 0. In the lab

frame, the far-ﬁeld angular distribution can be obtained by taking a spatial average over

the local emission patterns in the metastable cloud.

3.6 Radiation Trapping

The ﬂuorescence photons which result from metastable quenching have a frequency

very nearly equal to the 1S-2S transition frequency. Since this frequency is only detuned by

1.1 GHz (about 11 natural linewidths of the Lyman-α line) from the strong 1S-2P1/2 tran-
sitions, the photons have a non-negligible probability of absorption as they move through a

dense 1S sample. This phenomenon is known as radiation trapping, and it has consequences

for the detection eﬃciency of metastable atoms when using Lyman-α ﬂuorescence as the

means of detection. In particular, the detection eﬃciency can potentially vary with the 1S

density, the trap shape, and also with the geometry of the 2S cloud. This section, which

extends the work of [36], describes calculations relevant to predicting the eﬀects of radiation

trapping in realistic experimental geometries.

3.6.1 Cross Sections for Lyman-α Absorption

In the absence of ﬁne or hyperﬁne structure, the absorption cross-section σ for

incident photons detuned by δ from the resonant 1S-2P transition is given by

(0) = 1 and a FWHM of 100 MHz.5 To simplify matters, we can neglect all transitions to

than the 2P1/2 level, and the total cross section for 1S-2P3/2 absorption is about 2 orders
of magnitude smaller.

Equation 3.29 can be scaled to ﬁnd the cross section for a particular pair of hy-

perﬁne states and a particular polarization. The procedure is to multiply Eq. 3.29 by the

square of the appropriate matrix element of r between hyperﬁne states, normalizing by

varies as T 1/2.

3.6.2 Monte Carlo Simulation of Radiation Trapping

In order to accurately predict the eﬀects of radiation trapping under various exper-

imental conditions, a Monte Carlo simulation of the process was developed. The simulation

takes as inputs the shape of the magnetic trap, calculated numerically from magnet cur-

rents, and the distribution of metastables along z. The 2S distribution is calculated using

(3.31)

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

66

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

a simulation of the 1S-2S excitation process described in Sec. 5.3. It has a sensitive de-

pendence on the geometry of the excitation laser ﬁeld. The radiation trapping simulation

assumes that the 2S cloud is distributed radially according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann dis-

tribution at a speciﬁed temperature T . Meanwhile, the 1S cloud is assumed to have a

Maxwell-Boltzmann density distribution throughout the trap.

One Lyman-α photon is simulated at a time. For each photon, its trajectory is

computed by selecting the location of the emitting atom at random from the 2S cloud and

then randomly choosing a propagation direction. Typically, the propagation direction is

restricted to be within the detection solid angle. The quenching electric ﬁeld is assumed

to be uniform and perpendicular to the trap axis, and the photon polarization is randomly

selected according to the expressions in Table 3.1. To account for the diﬀerent angular

distributions of circularly and linearly polarized ﬂuorescence, each photon is assigned a

statistical weight in the simulation according to Table 3.2. Next, the photon is propagated

through the 1S cloud in steps which are small compared to the local absorption length

1/n1S σ, where σ is the absorption cross section corresponding to the photon polarization.

Random numbers are used to determine at each step whether the photon has been absorbed.

Once a photon is absorbed, the simulation assumes that, since the detection solid angle is

only

1

∼

10−2 sr, the photon scattered into a new direction will not be detected.

×
To a good approximation, the weighted fraction of photons absorbed in the detec-

tion solid angle equals the attenuation of metastable signal due to radiation trapping. At
1013 cm−3), the fraction absorbed is proportional to the density. For
1013 cm−3 and T = 87 µK (Trap W of Ch. 5), simulations

a sample with peak density 6.5

low 1S densities (< 1

×

×

predict that radiation trapping reduces the signal by 24-28%, with the uncertainty coming

predominantly from the shape of the metastable cloud.

Most photons are not initially emitted into the detection solid angle. One might

imagine that enough of these are scattered into the detection solid angle to signiﬁcantly

increase the detection eﬃciency. However, due to the fact that the detector is located on

the long axis of the trap, the scattering eﬀect is small. Most photons are initially emitted

in directions where the sample is optically thin, and they have little chance to be scattered.

A modiﬁed version of the radiation trapping simulation, in which photons are allowed to

radiate into all 4π steradians, predicts that less than 3% of the total ﬂuorescence is scattered

in the coldest and densest of the relevant samples. Furthermore, the average probability

of a scattered photon reaching the detector is less than that of an unscattered photon,

since scattering happens preferentially in the densest part of the sample, where a second

absorption event is more probable. For these reasons, we neglect the eﬀects of Lyman-α

Chapter 3: Trapped Metastable Hydrogen

scattering.

The simulation of ﬂuorescence into all directions uses the matrix elements of Ta-

ble 3.1 to additionally calculate Fd, the fraction of metastables returning to the trapped
1Sdi
|
sample. Knowledge of Fd is required for a detection eﬃciency determination described

ground state. The branching ratio is found to be nearly 50% for a typical cold, dense

in Ch. 5. Results from the radiation trapping simulations are applied to the analysis of

metastable decay data in the following chapters.

Metastable Decay Measurements:

Evidence for Two-Body Loss

The decay behavior of metastable clouds was studied in hydrogen samples spanning

a wide range of densities, temperatures, and magnetic trap shapes. Measurement techniques

were improved over several experimental runs, culminating in the data which is the focus

of this chapter and the next. Most of the data presented here was taken over a three

week period during which apparatus conditions were relatively constant. To improve the

signal-to-noise ratio, the same measurements were repeated multiple times in a few standard

magnetic trap conﬁgurations at speciﬁc points along an evaporation pathway. These traps

are described in the ﬁrst section below.

A main motivation for the metastable decay studies is to measure the loss rate

due to 2S-2S inelastic collisions. For such measurements to be possible, there must be

a discernible density dependence of the metastable decay. A simple ﬁrst-pass analysis

of the data in Sec. 4.2 provides evidence that, in cold, dense samples, the decay rate of

the metastable cloud depends strongly on the metastable density. Furthermore, at high

metastable densities, the early part of a decay curve can be ﬁt much better by a model

with a free two-body loss parameter and a ﬁxed one-body parameter than by a simple

exponential decay model.

In Ch. 5 the model incorporating two-body loss is applied to

extract a two-body loss rate constant for metastable H.

4.1 Summary of Traps

The four magnetic traps chosen for detailed studies are known as Traps W, X, Y,

and Z. In each trap, a ground state sample was prepared according to a consistent procedure,

and metastable clouds were excited in this sample. The label “Trap W” will sometimes be

used below to mean “the sample in Trap W.” The trap shapes and some parameters of the

1S cloud are shown in Figs. 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4.

In order to determine collisional rate constants from the metastable decay, it is

important to know the 1S density and temperature for each sample. Both parameters are

needed to calculate the spatial distribution of the metastable cloud; these calculations will

be detailed in Ch. 5. To determine the metastable density, it is also necessary to know the

detection eﬃciency for metastables. The calibration of the detection eﬃciency presented in

Sec. 5.4 requires knowledge of N1S, the initial number of atoms in the sample. To ﬁnd N1S,

the peak density n1S can be multiplied by the numerically calculated eﬀective volume V1S.

The measured temperature and 1S density, together with V1S and N1S, are summarized for

the four traps in Table 4.1.

When measuring the temperature or density of a sample, it is important to en-

sure that the temperature has reached an equilibrium value which is maintained during

the measurement. After the end of an evaporation sequence in which the trap depth is

ramped downward, the sample will continue to cool for a time up to tens of seconds as

the temperature asymptotically approaches an equilibrium value. This cooling has been

observed directly in Trap W by scanning the excitation laser frequency repeatedly across

the Doppler-sensitive line for about 1 minute after the evaporation ramp (Fig. 4.5). The

average temperature during a given time interval was found by ﬁtting the lineshape accu-

mulated during the interval to a Gaussian, as in Fig. 1.5. In the case of Traps W, X, and Y,

the standard practice was to hold the sample for 30 s after the evaporation ramp to allow

equilibrium to be reached. At higher temperatures, evaporation proceeds more eﬃciently,

and the sample is expected to be near equilibrium throughout the evaporation sequence.

For this reason, no hold time was employed for Trap Z.

The temperatures of the equilibrated samples were determined by a combination of

methods. For Trap W, which involved the coldest sample, the temperature was determined

with an uncertainty of 5% from a Gaussian ﬁt to the Doppler-sensitive 1S-2S line (Fig. 1.5).

In the case of Trap X, the temperature was found by comparing the width of the Doppler-free

1S-2S lines for low density samples in it and Trap W (Fig. 1.4). The temperature extracted

in this way agrees well with the trap depth divided by the equilibrium value of η, determined

self-consistently from numerical simulations of a cylindrical quadrupole trap uniform in z

[29]. For higher temperature samples, the most reliable way to determine temperature at

present is to obtain η from simulations and use kT = Ut/η, where Ut is the trap depth.

This was done for Traps Y and Z. The estimated uncertainty in the temperatures for Traps

X, Y, and Z is 10%.

Once the temperature of a sample is known, the 1S density can be determined by

the bolometric method described in Sec. 2.3.3. The densities in Table 4.1 were determined

this way. They have an estimated total uncertainty of 20%. Some of this uncertainty stems

from systematic uncertainty in the dipolar decay constant and aﬀects all of the density

measurements in the same way; the measured densities should be accurate to 10% relative

to each other.

Values for the eﬀective volume of the 1S cloud were obtained by numerical evalua-

tion of V1S =

exp(

U (r)/kT ) over the trap region. Since the gravity gradient (12 µK/cm)

−

is not strong enough to signiﬁcantly distort the trapping potentials at these temperatures, it

R

was neglected in the calculations. The uncertainty in V1S is dominated by the temperature
T 2 in all of
uncertainty. For small changes in T , numerical calculations show that V1S ∼
the traps. Thus, V1S is accurate to about 10% for Trap W and 20% for the other traps.

The number of atoms N1S in each trap was obtained by multiplying no,1S by V1S. Since

the fractional uncertainties in no,1S and V1S are essentially independent, we can add them

in quadrature to ﬁnd that the accuracy of the N1S values is 20-30%, closer to 20% for Trap

W, and closer to 30% for the others.

A phase space representation of the four standard samples is shown in Fig 4.6. To

prepare the sample in Trap W, an rf evaporation ﬁeld was ramped from 35 MHz to 20 MHz

and then held constant at 20 MHz for the duration of measurements. No rf evaporation

was employed in the other traps. Although Trap W is considerably colder than Trap X,

it contains almost as many atoms. This is because Trap W has less radial compression

than Trap X. For Traps W, X, and Y, the energy of the trap minimum was determined by

slowly sweeping the rf frequency upward from near DC until atoms were ejected from the

sample and observed on the bolometer. In each of these traps, the minimum was found to

be consistently 180-200 µK lower than the value predicted by numerical calculations based

on the magnet currents. This discrepancy is assumed to be due either to uncertainty in the

magnet geometry or to a stray ﬁeld component pointing along the trap axis. For Trap Z,

the trap minimum was estimated by subtracting 200 µK from the numerically calculated

trap minimum.

4.2 Density-Dependent Decay Rates

To measure a two-body loss process in metastable H, it is important to have close

control of not only the one-body decay rate and but also the 2S density. A ﬁrst goal for

our experiments was to see a systematic eﬀect on metastable decay due to density. In this

section, it is shown how the eﬀective decay rate varied in each trap over the achievable

2S density range. More speciﬁcally, an eﬀective decay rate is calculated as a function

of the metastable signal in a decay curve. To a ﬁrst approximation, the signal is simply

proportional to the 2S density in the trap.

The density of metastables excited by a UV laser pulse varies during the excitation

phase for several reasons. First, the ground state sample density decreases over many

seconds due to dipolar decay. Second, the laser frequency is generally scanned back and

forth across the center of the Doppler-free 1S-2S resonance. This allows the line center

frequency relative to the laser’s reference cavity to be established in each trap cycle. The

relative frequency drifts typically

20 kHz per hour, measured at 243 nm. Since the laser

∼

frequency is stepped after each decay curve measurement, the detuning is stepped, and

the excitation rate changes. Finally, there are sources of noise operating on a time scale

which is short compared to the time required to make a decay measurement. These include

ﬂuctuations in the laser power and the overlap of the counterpropagating UV beams.

In order to obtain enough signal-to-noise for a useful analysis, the decay curves

from the data set for a given trap must be grouped or “binned” together. To look for an

76

Chapter 4: Metastable Decay Measurements: Evidence for Two-Body Loss

eﬀect dependent on the number of metastables excited, the decay curves can be binned

according to the total number of metastable signal counts in each decay curve. This means

that decay curves corresponding to approximately the same initial density are averaged

together. Next, the average decay curve for each signal bin is ﬁt with a model function.

For a preliminary analysis, we use a simple exponential decay function

s(t) = Aoe−αt

(4.1)

as a model, where s(t) is the number of signal counts at a time t following the laser pulse,

and the free parameters are an eﬀective decay rate α and initial signal amplitude Ao. Even

when the decay curve is distinctly nonexponential, the quantity 1/α derived from a ﬁt

provides a useful measure of the lifetime of the metastable cloud. For cases where the decay

is well described by Eq. 4.1, α can be interpreted as the total rate of one-body metastable

loss processes.

Figure 4.7 summarizes the results for decay rates determined from ﬁts to a simple

exponential. The most dense metastable cloud is excited in Trap W, which contains the

coldest, most dense ground state sample. In this trap, there is a clear monotonic increase

of the eﬀective decay rate with the number of metastables excited. For Trap X, which is

warmer and less dense, the maximum decay rates are not as large, but the same trend with

metastable signal is present. In the warmest and least dense samples, there is only a small

increase in decay rate at the largest metastable population achievable in those traps.

It should be mentioned that the observed dependence of decay rate on metastable

number is not a consequence of correlated variations in ground state sample density. To

generate Fig. 4.7, all metastable decay curves with approximately the same initial metasta-

ble signal were binned together without regard to the ground state density, which decayed

over the course of each laser scan from the initial values in Table 4.1. For each ground state

density, a range of metastable populations was generated by varying the laser detuning.

Since 2S density increases with 2S signal in a given trap, the data indicate the

presence of metastable loss processes which depend on the metastable density. The eﬀect

is strongest in Trap W, where the largest metastable densities were achieved. As will be

explained in Sec. 5.3, a numerical simulation can be used to calculate the spatial distribution

of 2S atoms for a given trap and laser geometry. This distribution can be integrated to

obtain the eﬀective volume of the metastable cloud. For resonant excitation, the peak

number of metastables excited in a laser pulse is 50-70% larger in Trap W than in Trap

Z, while the volume occupied by the 2S cloud in Trap W is

60 times smaller (assuming

Figure 4.8: Average decay curves at two diﬀerent signal levels in Trap W. The parent data
set was gathered over ﬁve trap cycles, and the error bars account for only statistical error.
For the curve in (a), more than 60 individual decay measurements have been averaged, and
the statistical errors are smaller than the markers; non-statistical scatter is evident. For
(b), the curve is the average of the two decay measurements in the data set with the largest
signal. In case (b), where the initial metastable number is more than 6 times larger, a “one-
plus-two” model ﬁts the data better than a simple exponential. The one-plus-two model (see
Sec. 5.1) incorporates terms corresponding to both one- and two-body loss, and it assumes
the shape of the 2S cloud is static. In reality, the 2S distribution ﬂattens somewhat as the
cloud decays, and it is not surprising that the model deviates from the data at long wait
times (Sec. 5.5.3).

79

density achieved in Trap W may be as much as 100 times larger than in Trap Z.

Qualitatively, the increase in peak decay rate going from Z to W is consistent

with the existence of two-body inelastic processes which become increasingly signiﬁcant

at higher 2S densities. The data could also be consistent with an inelastic rate constant

which increases with decreasing temperature. However, theoretical predictions for the rele-

vant inelastic processes indicate that the rate coeﬃcients should be nearly independent of

temperature in the temperature range of these experiments (Fig 3.1).

In Traps W and X, the decay curves were observed to be exponential for low 2S

signal and distinctly nonexponential at high 2S signal. This is illustrated in the semi-

logarithmic plots of Fig. 4.8. In Fig. 4.8(a), the data is well ﬁt by a simple exponential.

For the decay curve starting at high signal in Fig. 4.8(b), there is a clear departure from an

exponential. The data is better ﬁt with a model which has a ﬁxed one-body decay parameter

and a free two-body parameter (“one-plus-two model”). The procedure for ﬁtting to this

model and extracting a 2S-2S inelastic rate constant is described in the following chapter.

Chapter 5

Dynamics

Analysis of Metastable Loss

In order to determine the loss rate constant K2 associated with 2S-2S inelastic

collisions, it is convenient to ﬁrst assume that the metastable cloud shape does not change

as it decays. This allows the decay data to be ﬁt by a simple model incorporating both

one-body and two-body loss terms. The one-body parameter of the model can be ﬁxed at

the exponential decay rate inferred from the data for the limit of zero metastable density.

With the one-body parameter ﬁxed, the two-body parameter is easily determined from ﬁts

to decay curves. To ﬁnd K2, it is also necessary to know the geometry of the metastable

cloud and the detection eﬃciency for metastables; these pieces of information establish the

link between the 2S density and the observed signal. As will be explained in this chapter,

the geometry and detection eﬃciency are diﬃcult to determine precisely, and this gives rise

to much of the uncertainty in the ﬁnal values for K2. Some more uncertainty arises because

the 2S spatial distribution ﬂattens signiﬁcantly during a decay, and it is necessary to apply

a correction factor based on a dynamic simulation of the cloud. Nevertheless, it is possible

to determine K2 to within a factor of about 2 with our data, and the results are compatible

with the current state of theory. It is also possible with our data to set limits on the loss

rates due to 1S-2S inelastic collisions. The details of the analysis follow.

5.1 One-Plus-Two Model

The extraction of a rate constant from the decay data is straightforward if we

assume that (1) loss occurs solely due to a combination of one- and two-body processes

(“one-plus-two model”) and (2) the shape of the metastable cloud is constant in time (“static

80

Chapter 5: Analysis of Metastable Loss Dynamics

approximation”). Three-body loss is not expected to play a role at the metastable densities
1011 cm−3 or less). If the 2S distribution in the trap and the detec-

achieved to date (

∼

tion eﬃciency are known, then a total two-body loss constant in terms of density can be

computed from the two-body parameter in the model.

In the static approximation of the one-plus-two model, the decay of the metastable

(5.2)

Since α1 and α2 are highly correlated, it is not useful to vary both of these ﬁt

parameters simulataneously. Fortunately, α1 can be determined by extrapolation of eﬀective

decay rates α to the limit of very low metastable density; this will be explained more fully

in Sec. 5.5. The parameter α1 represents the background one-body decay rate which occurs

in a given trap regardless of the metastable density. With the ﬁxed value for α1, the decay

curves for all initial 2S densities can subsequently be ﬁt with Eq. 5.2, using α2 and Ao as

free parameters. This was the procedure used to determine the solid curve in Fig. 4.8(b).

5.2 Two-Body Loss Constant in the Static Approximation

As discussed in Sec. 3.4, the relative spatial distribution of the metastable cloud

evolves during its lifetime due to diﬀusion and two-body loss. For the purposes of extracting

a value for the two-body loss constant from the decay data, however, we start with the

simplifying assumption that the relative 2S distribution is static in time. The eﬀect of

metastable cloud dynamics will be considered afterwards in Sec. 5.5.3.

The desired two-body loss constant, K2, is deﬁned so that it gives the total local

rate of 2S density change due to two-body processes:

The quantity measured experimentally is s(t), the number of metastable signal

5.3 Spatial Distribution of Metastables

5.3.1 Monte Carlo Calculation of 2S Distribution

A lineshape simulation was developed by L. Willmann of the MIT Ultracold Hydro-

gen Group to calculate the 1S-2S excitation spectrum for realistic experimental conditions.

The simulation can be used to calculate the spectrum due to atoms excited at diﬀerent z

positions. If contributions for enough diﬀerent z positions are calculated, the distribution of

metastables immediately following excitation can be extracted from the lineshape results.

The input parameters to the simulation include the laser ﬁeld geometry, the trap

shape, the sample temperature, and the chemical potential, which is related to the sample

Chapter 5: Analysis of Metastable Loss Dynamics

density by the Bose-Einstein distribution. The simulation is based on the principle that

the contribution to the excitation spectrum by a single atom is proportional to the Fourier

transform of the electric ﬁeld experienced by the atom during the excitation pulse. More-

over, the cold-collision shift is incorporated by allowing the resonance frequency to vary

during the pulse according to the trajectory of the atom in the trap; if r(t) is the atom
trajectory, the resonance frequency as a function of time is νo −
unperturbed resonance frequency and χ is the cold-collision shift per unit density. When

χn1S(r(t)), where νo is the

the laser ﬁeld intensity and instantaneous resonance frequency are sampled at a suﬃcient

number of points along the trajectory, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm accurately

produces the single-atom lineshape contribution.

In each simulation, a Monte Carlo routine ﬁrst generates a density of trajectory

states table with trajectories classiﬁed according to z, the maximum distance from trap

center ρmax during a complete “orbit”, and the orbital angular momentum L. The orbits

are considered to occur at constant z, since the distance traveled by the atoms along z during

a laser pulse is small compared to the trap length scale. Momentum-changing collisions are

neglected since typical collision times are longer than the laser pulse. Next, the FFT’s

of a prescribed number of trajectories are computed in a second Monte Carlo procedure.

The contribution of each FFT to the ﬁnal spectrum is weighted according to the density of

trajectory states and the Bose-Einstein distribution.

The lineshape simulation has produced spectra in good agreement with experi-

mental spectra for a wide range of trap shapes, laser geometries, sample densities, and

temperatures. For the purposes of the analysis presented here, suﬃcient accuracy in the 2S

distribution is obtained for a given set of input parameters after about one hour of CPU

time on a computer which performs the FFT of a 1024-point trajectory every

50 ms.

5.3.2 Results of Spatial Distribution Calculations

The Monte Carlo simulation provides the axial distribution of metastables in the

trap. Under the assumption that a thermal distribution is established quickly in the radial

direction, the distribution function f2S(r) is easily calculated for the entire trap. Using the

photoionization correction factor C(z, t) described in Sec. 3.3, the distribution function is

corrected for photoionization losses during the excitation pulse. Numerical integration can

then be used to determine the geometry factor ζ.

By varying the input parameters to the simulation, the sensitivity of ζ to various

experimental uncertainties can be determined. The most important uncertainty by far is

found in how well the focuses of the counterprograting UV beams are overlapped along

z. The alignment of the beams to the trap axis can be done accurately using the imaging

technique of Fig. 2.9, and the concave cell retromirror eﬀectively ﬁxes the centroid of the

incoming and return focuses. However, it is diﬃcult to ensure that no separation exists

between the focuses. The present method of minimizing the separation is to match the

sizes of the overlapped incoming and return beam modes in Telescope 2 of Fig. 2.8. This is

accomplished by adjusting the length of the telescope. The estimated typical discrepancy

in mode sizes for the decay measurements presented here is 10% or less, which translates

into a separation of 1.8 cm or less between the two beam waists.

The dependence of the 2S spatial distribution on the separation of the laser focuses

is illustrated for Trap W in Fig. 5.1. A separation of 1.8 cm produces a signiﬁcant change

since the local Doppler-free excitation rate depends on the product of incoming and return

beam intensities, and the Rayleigh range is only 0.6 cm for the 21 µm waist radius. Values

of ζ determined in this and other traps for zero laser detuning are summarized in Table 5.1.

Chapter 5: Analysis of Metastable Loss Dynamics

shape of the metastable cloud, the shape also depends on laser detuning. This is a conse-

quence of the cold-collision shift. The atomic resonance frequency of an atom passing in

and out of a dense region of the ground state cloud is chirped by the changing cold-collision

shift, which is proportional to the local density. In this way, the excitation spectrum of a

single atom is both broadened and shifted. At red detunings (laser frequencies less than

the unperturbed 1S-2S resonance frequency), the 2S distribution is slightly more concen-

trated near the trap minimum in z than for zero detuning. This is because the high density

near the trap minimum shifts the atomic resonances to lower frequency. At blue detunings

the relative metastable distribution will generally again become more concentrated about

the trap minimum since most of the excited atoms are ones whose resonances have been

suﬃciently chirped in a high density region.

Figure 5.2 shows the variation of ζ in Trap W over the range of detunings used

for most 2S decay measurements. The dependence on detuning is stronger when the laser

focuses are separated. In traps where peak densities are smaller and the ground state cloud

extents are larger relative to the laser depth of focus, the dependence on detuning is less.

For example, in Trap Z, ζ varies by less than 20% over the detuning range used in Fig. 5.2,

even for focuses separated by 1.8 cm.

5.4 Measurement of Detection Eﬃciency

To obtain K2 from α2 in the static approximation, it is crucial to know not only

ζ but also the detection eﬃciency ǫ. The detection eﬃciency completes the connection

between the metastable signal, which we observe, and the metastable density.

While it is diﬃcult to measure ǫ precisely with the current apparatus, it can be

calibrated to better than a factor of 2 by depleting the ground state sample as quickly

as possible through 1S-2S excitation. For an ideal measurement by this approach, the

only signiﬁcant loss mechanism would be excitation, and the detection eﬃciency would be

given simply by the total number of signal counts observed divided by the initial number

of atoms in the trap, N1S(0). However, even in cases where the depletion rate due to

excitation is high, there can also be signiﬁcant loss due to dipolar decay and due to laser

heating of the trapping cell, which causes helium atoms to be evaporated from the cell

walls. Another complicating factor in a real experiment is that a considerable fraction of

the metastables relax back to the trapped d ground state and are subsequently excited again

(see Sec. 3.6.2). Finally, since the metastables are quenched after some wait time following

the laser pulse, some correction needs to be made for the signal “missing” due to inelastic

collisions of metastables during the wait time. The following paragraphs outline a method

for extracting the detection eﬃciency which takes all these factors into account.

Figure 5.3 shows the results of a ground state depletion experiment in Trap X.

The 243 nm laser frequency is swept back and forth across the central 10 kHz of the 1S-2S

line, completing a sweep in one direction every 150 ms. Since the laser frequency remains

near the center of the line, the sample is depleted quickly; after 120 s, only a few percent of

N1S(0) remain in the trap. To analyze the data, the number of signal counts observed after

each laser pulse was ﬁrst corrected for the loss which occurs during the 5.4 ms wait time

between excitation and quench pulses. This was done by extrapolating backwards in time

using Eq. 5.2 with experimentally determined values of α1 and α2. Next, the extrapolated

signal was summed across each laser sweep, and the results were ﬁt with a smooth curve

y(t), shown in Fig. 5.3, where t = 0 is the beginning of the depletion experiment. The

88

Chapter 5: Analysis of Metastable Loss Dynamics

quantity y(t) serves as a distribution function of the 1S-2S signal in time.

To understand how the detection eﬃciency is extracted from y(t), we consider its

relationship to W1S−2S(t), the excitation rate at time t averaged over a laser sweep:

ǫ(t) =

y(t)
W1S−2S(t)

.

We neglect here the small number of metastables lost during the excitation pulse itself. The

detection eﬃciency is an increasing function of time, because the number of ﬂuorescence

photons “lost” due to radiation trapping decreases as the 1S density decreases (Sec. 3.6.2).

It is useful to calculate the average detection eﬃciency ¯ǫ per metastable during the depletion

F (0) = 0.22 in Trap X with an uncertainty of 20% stemming primarily from uncertainty in

the initial ground state density. This number is relatively insensitive to the sample temper-

ature, the laser detuning, and the separation of the laser focuses. Results from simulations

at several sample densities in Trap X were used to show F (t)

5.5 Two-Body Loss: Experimental Results

5.5.1 K2 in the Static Approximation

With values for ζ and ǫ in hand, we can ﬁnally turn our attention again to α2 and

the determination of K2.

Before ﬁtting the decay curves of a given data set to extract α2, the ﬁxed value for

α1, the “background” one-body loss rate, must be chosen. This is accomplished by ﬁtting

decay curves at diﬀerent metastable signal levels with simple exponentials and extrapolating

the corresponding decay rates to zero metastable signal. Plots of the best-ﬁtting exponential

decay rate α against metastable signal show, to a good approximation, that decay rates are

linear with metastable signal, suggesting that linear extrapolation is a reasonable way to

apart under identical conditions, except that the excitation laser power was 30% larger in the

for a 30% increase in UV power indicates that these experiments are in a saturation regime
for metastable production.

Figure 5.4 shows linear extrapolations of the one-body rates to zero signal for two

diﬀerent data sets in Trap W. The resulting values of α1, employing decay curves from

the entire data sets, are in good agreement. Since the data sets were taken on diﬀerent

days with diﬀerent laser powers, the agreement provides evidence that (1) trap conditions,

including stray electric ﬁelds, were relatively constant over a period of several days and (2)

systematic eﬀects associated with changes in the laser power are small.

The decay data compiled to create Fig. 5.4 was taken continuously over the ﬁrst

120 s after sample preparation at a rate of one decay curve every 0.8 s. The ground state

sample depletes substantially during this time due to dipolar decay. In Trap W, for example,

the peak ground state density decreases by two-thirds. To minimize the role of systematics

associated with changes in the ground state sample density, only decay curves taken within

the ﬁrst 10-15 s after sample preparation were considered in the determination of K2. In

all of the traps, the 1S density decreased by less than 20% in the time required to acquire

this data subset. Furthermore, since the laser duty cycle was only 2%, ground state losses

due to laser heating and excitation were insigniﬁcant. Since α1 can vary as the ground

state density changes (see Sec. 5.6), the same 10-15 s subset of decay curves was employed

to determine a value of α1 to use when ﬁtting to the one-plus-two model. As an example,

Fig. 5.5 shows the linear extrapolation used to ﬁnd α1 for the ﬁrst 9.6 s of a Trap W data

set.

After α1 has been determined, the decay data is ﬁt to the one-plus-two model. To

accumulate enough statistics, a typical data set encompasses ﬁve consecutive trap cycles.

cycle are binned according to laser detuning. The resulting curves are ﬁt with Eq. 5.2,

are substituted into Eq. 5.10 to obtain values for K2 in the static approximation. Since

the 1S density and the cold-collision shift do not change much in 10-15 s, it is a good

approximation to assume that the value of ζ calculated for each detuning is constant. As

shown in Fig. 5.6, the K2 values are relatively independent of detuning, indicating that the

variations in metastable cloud shape with detuning are reasonably accounted for by the

spatial distribution calculations. The experimental value of K2 for a given trap is taken to

be the weighted average of the values determined at diﬀerent detunings.

Table 5.3 summarizes the results for K2 obtained in the static approximation.

The asymmetric error bars for Traps W and X derive mostly from systematic uncertainties,

which are summarized in Sec. 5.5.2.

In traps Y and Z, the weighted average of K2 is

consistent with zero (Fig. 5.7). Nevertheless, an upper limit for K2 has been established

by linear addition of the uncertainties in α2, ǫ, and ζ appropriate for these traps. If K2

maintains the same order of magnitude across the temperature range spanned by Traps W,

X, Y, and Z, it is not surprising that two-body loss is diﬃcult to detect in Traps Y and Z,

given the much lower metastable densities and the sizeable systematics.

Table 5.3: Results for K2 in the static approximation. The sources of uncertainty will be
discussed in Sec. 5.5.2.

At red detunings larger than 10 kHz and blue detunings larger than 5 kHz, the

metastable cloud in Trap W appeared sometimes to decay very rapidly in the ﬁrst 10-

20 ms after excitation, implying values of K2 far above the wighted average. For example,

note the outlying point in the most blue-detuned bin of Fig. 5.6. The origin of these

anomalously steep decay curves is not yet understood. Perhaps at large detunings either

(1) the metastable distributions calculated by Monte Carlo simulation are inaccurate or

(2) transient redistribution of the 2S cloud in the ﬁrst

10 ms somehow leads to an

∼

accelerated decay of the observed ﬂuorescence. The statistical weight of the anomalously

fast decay curves is small, however, and their inclusion in the weighted average has little

eﬀect on the ﬁnal results.

A check was made to see if the results for K2 were biased by the fact that only

the ﬁrst few time points in the decay curve are sensitive to two-body decay. For example,

consider that during the ﬁrst 30 ms following excitation of a large metastable population

in Trap W, the 2S number decays by a factor of 4. The two-body loss rate, which depends

locally on the square of the metastable density, decreases dramatically during this time. For

the remaining

60 ms of the measured decay curve, one-body loss dominates. The check

∼

consisted in repeating the measurements in Trap W with eight wait times concentrated in

the ﬁrst 30 ms of the decay. The resulting value for K2 agreed to within 10% of the previous

measurements made with eight time points distributed across 92 ms. This conﬁrms that

the results were not signiﬁcantly biased by the chosen distribution of wait times.

5.5.2 Uncertainties: Static Approximation

The uncertainties relevant to determination of K2 under the assumption of a static

2S cloud shape are summarized for Trap W in Table 5.4. Most of the uncertainties are

Table 5.4: Uncertainties for the static approximation determination of K2 in Trap W. To
obtain the total relative error, the values in the table are added in quadrature, excluding the
ζ contributions from ground state density n1S and the temperature T (see explanation in
text). The “overlap of waists” refers to the separation of incoming and return laser focuses
along z, while the “trap/laser focus oﬀset” refers to the location of the laser focuses in z
with respect to the trap minimum. The contribution labeled “cold-collision shift” is due
to uncertainty in the parameter which relates the shift of the 1S-2S transition to the 1S
density.

systematic in nature, stemming from imprecise knowledge of the excitation geometry and

also of the sample temperature and density. The uncertainties which enter through ζ have

been estimated by varying the inputs to the numerical calculation of the 2S distribution.

The overall error bars are asymmetric due to asymmetric uncertainty in the detection

eﬃciency and the fact that laser misalignments generally lead to an increase in ζ.

The uncertainty budget for Trap X is similar to Table 5.4. For Trap X, however, the

uncertainty in α2 is 30%, and the upper relative error associated with overlap of the focuses

is 65%. The smaller relative errors associated with ζ have not been explicitly calculated

for Trap X, but are assumed not to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those in Trap W. In both of

these traps, the uncertainty in α2 stems mainly from the imprecise extrapolation of α1; the

parameters α1 and α2 are highly correlated in the one-plus-two model.

With a couple exceptions, the uncertainties in Table 5.4 are assumed to be uncor-

related. The errors in ground state temperature and density are responsible for most of the

uncertainty in ǫ. However, the T and n1S contributions to ǫ are somewhat anti-correlated

with the corresponding contributions to ζ. In other words, an error in T (or n1S) leads to

errors in ǫ and ζ with opposite signs. To be conservative, the possibility of small partial

Chapter 5: Analysis of Metastable Loss Dynamics

97

cancellations is ignored by neglecting the n1S and T contributions to ζ. The estimated total

relative error is found by adding all other uncertainties in quadrature.

5.5.3 Eﬀects of the Changing Metastable Cloud Shape

As acknowledged before, the shape of the metastable cloud changes while it is

decaying. Although thermal equilibrium is maintained in the radial direction, the shape of

the cloud evolves in the axial direction due to diﬀusion and to two-body loss, which occurs

preferentially where metastable density is highest. To estimate the corrections which must

be made to the static approximation analysis in order to account for these dynamics, a

numerical simulation of the decaying metastable cloud was developed.

The simulation begins with a distribution f2S(r), calculated for a particular trap,

excitation geometery, and laser detuning by the Monte Carlo method of Sec. 5.3. Other

inputs to the simulation include the peak ground state density no,1S, a putative value for

K2, a uniform one-body loss rate α1, a one-dimensional diﬀusion parameter, the detection

eﬃciency ǫ, and so, the number of signal counts which would be experimentally observed

when quenching immediately after the excitation pulse.

The diﬀusion parameter is the proportionality constant Cdiﬀ in the relation

σz(na,1S, t) = Cdiﬀ

1/2

,

t
na,1S !

 

(5.21)

where σz is the rms diﬀusion length of 2S atoms along z in a background 1S gas, t is the

corresponding diﬀusion time, and na,1S is the 1S density on the trap axis. Using the Monte
105 (cm
Carlo diﬀusion simulation described in Sec. 3.4.2, Cdiﬀ was calculated to be 4.3
ms)−1/2 at the minimum of Trap W. This constant has some dependence on the local radial

×

curvature of the trap. However, for the purpose of simulating the evolution of the metastable

cloud in the presence of large two-body losses, it is a good approximation to neglect the

variation of Cdiﬀ with z.

In the simulation, the initial number of metastables so/ǫ is used to establish an

initial absolute 2S distribution. At any given time, if the number distribution dN2S(z)/dz

is known, the density distribution n2S(r) can be calculated everywhere assuming that the

radial distribution is Maxwell-Boltzmann. For each step in time ∆t, the total number of

atoms lost to one- and two-body processes is numerically integrated as a function of z,

and dN2S (z)/dz is adjusted accordingly. To account for diﬀusion during the time step,

the distribution in z is also convoluted with a Gaussian of rms width σz(z, ∆t), whose

z dependence comes from na,1S(z). The time evolution of dN2S(z)/dz for an example

simulation in Trap W is shown in Fig. 5.8.

To compare the cases of “static” and “dynamic” evolution of the metastable cloud,

the dynamic simulation also evolves the number in a static cloud starting from the same

initial conditions. At each time step, loss is calculated in the static cloud in the same way

as in the dynamic cloud, but only the total 2S number is adjusted and not the relative

distribution. The static and dynamic evolutions for the initial conditions of Fig. 5.8 are

compared in Fig. 5.9. After each step in time, the geometry factor ζ is calculated for both

static and dynamic cases. Since diﬀusion and two-body loss cause f2S(r) to become less

sharply peaked, ζ increases with time in the dynamic simulation. The rate of increase slows

as the peak 2S density drops and two-body loss becomes less important relative to one-body

loss. The eﬀect of the increase in ζ in the dynamic case is to decrease the two-body loss

rate relative to the static case (Eq. 5.7). This eﬀect is only important, however, during the

early part of the decay when two-body loss dominates.

As illustrated in Fig. 5.10, the results of the simulation can be used to calculate a

dynamic correction for α2 in the one-plus-two model (Sec. 5.1). In the ﬁgure, the simulated

N2S(t) curves have been multiplied by ǫ at the experimental wait times to obtain decay

curves similar to those in the experiment. Applying statistical error bars and using an

experimentally determined value for α1, the simulated static and dynamic decay curves are

ﬁt to the one-plus-two model to ﬁnd α2 in each case. A dynamic correction factor fdc can

be deﬁned as follows:

fdc =

α2,static
α2,dynamic

.

(5.22)

The values of α2 extracted from ﬁts of the one-plus-two model to experimental decay curves

can be multiplied by fdc to account for the ﬂattening of the metastable distribution as the

cloud decays.

The simulation was executed many times with the parameters of Traps W and X

to ﬁnd fdc as a function of laser detuning. These results were used to correct the static

approximation values for K2, and a new weighted average K2 was determined for each

trap. The input parameters to the simulation were varied to estimate the uncertainty in

the overall correction to K2. It was found that the static approximation values of K2 must

be multiplied by 1.35 and 1.30, respectively, to correct for dynamics in Traps W and X. The

uncertainty in these factors is estimated to be 10%. For Traps Y and Z, a conservative upper

limit for the correction factor is 2, and the upper limits for K2 in the static approximation

are multiplied accordingly. The corrected experimental values for K2 are listed in Table 5.5.

In principle, the dynamic simulation could be used to accurately “ﬁt” the experi-

mental decay curves. However, the simulation has too many weakly constrained parameters

for a more accurate determination of K2 than what has already been accomplished by cor-

recting the static approximation. In addition, since many iterations of the simulation are

required to ﬁnd a convergence of the simulation results, the CPU time required is enor-

mously larger than when ﬁtting to the simple one-plus-two model.

It should be noted that the one-body loss rate was assumed in the simulation to be

uniform over the entire sample. This is a good assumption if the one-body loss rate is mostly

due to natural decay and quenching by stray ﬁelds. In Trap W, however, it is possible that

there is signiﬁcant one-body loss due to inelastic 1S-2S collisions (see Sec. 5.6). Since the

contribution to the one-body loss rate due to 1S-2S collisions is proportional to the ground

state density, the total one-body loss rate in this case will be appreciably higher where the

ground state sample is most dense, and there will be additional ﬂattening of the 2S spatial

distribution. This additional ﬂattening is not likely to perturb the results for K2 by more

than a few percent, however.

The eﬀects of the rf evaporation ﬁeld (present only in Trap W) on the metastable

cloud were neglected in the simulation. In principle, since the hyperﬁne structure of the

2S atoms is the same as the 1S atoms at low ﬁelds, the rf “surface of death” can eject

2S atoms with the same probability as 1S atoms. Experimentally, however, this additional

source of loss appears not to be signiﬁcant for the rf ﬁeld strengths in our apparatus. Decay

measurements were made with a cold, dense sample where the rf ﬁeld was switched oﬀ

during the wait time before each quench pulse. The results were compared to the case

where the rf ﬁeld was on throughout the decay measurements. Within uncertainties, no

diﬀerence in decay behavior was observed.

Evaporation of metastables over the magnetic saddlepoint threshold should not

play a role in the evolution of the metastable cloud in any of the traps. The 2S atoms do

not have time to diﬀuse from the region of excitation to the magnetic barrier.

5.5.4 Summary of Two-Body Loss Results

The ﬁnal experimental values for the two-body loss constant of metastable H are

plotted in Fig. 5.11 along with a theoretical curve based on Eq. 3.7. There are at least two

features noteworthy in the comparison.

First, in its current state of development, the theory of Forrey et al. predicts a

somewhat larger value of K2 than what was measured at the lowest temperatures. However,

considering that the theory does not yet include hyperﬁne structure or the eﬀects of a

trapping magnetic ﬁeld (Sec. 3.1.2), corrections which could shift the theoretical results by

as much as an order of magnitude, we conclude that the theory and experiment are in range

of one other.

Second, the two experimental data points suggest that there is a signiﬁcant tem-

perature dependence of the inelastic rates between 87 µK and 230 µK. Although the uncer-

tainty ranges on the absolute values of K2 are large enough to overlap, the error bars are

mostly due to systematic uncertainties which aﬀect both points in approximately the same

104

way. When the correlated errors are removed, our analysis leads to the conclusion that

K2 increases by a factor of 1.9

0.4 as the temperature decreases from 230 µK to 87 µK.

This temperature dependence is considerably larger than predicted by theory. It will be

interesting to see whether further theoretical reﬁnements resolve this discrepancy.

5.6 One-Body Loss and Inelastic 1S-2S Collisions

Taking advantage of the fact that metastable decay data is taken continuously

while the 1S sample decays, we can look for a dependence of decay rates on the 1S density.

This will lead to quantitative conclusions about the prevalence of loss caused by inelastic

1S-2S collisions in the trap.

The total one-body decay rate α1 for a metastable cloud is the sum of several

rates, including the natural decay rate, the quenching rate due to stray electric ﬁelds, the

loss rate due to the generation of helium vapor by laser heating, and any 1S-2S inelastic

collision rates. Ejection of metastables by an rf evaporation ﬁeld would also contribute to

the total one-body loss rate; as mentioned in Sec. 5.5.3, however, loss due to rf has not
been detected in our apparatus. The natural decay rate is well known: γnat = 8.2 s−1.
Loss due to residual electric ﬁelds is diﬃcult to measure directly, but ﬁeld compensation

measurements (Sec. 2.6.5) repeated several times in a single data-taking session showed that
the rate varies by less than 1 s−1 over several hours. In the decay experiments reported

here, the laser heating loss is expected to be very small due to the small laser duty cycle. If

there are inelastic 1S-2S collisions causing measurable metastable loss, then the one-body

decay rate should vary with the ground state density. Experimentally, the parameter α1,

found by extrapolating ﬁtted exponential decay rates to zero metastable density, ranges
between 10 and 17 s−1 in the initially prepared samples of Traps W, X, Y, and Z. There

is not an obvious trend with 1S density, though, which may be due of the fact that these

samples are at diﬀerent temperatures.

By dividing the decay data for a single trap into time bins corresponding to a ﬁxed

number of sweeps across resonance, we can examine whether the one-body loss rate changes

as the ground state sample decays at a constant temperature. Figure 5.12(a) shows values

for α1 determined in consecutive time bins for Trap W. The putative ground state density is

shown for the same time interval in Fig. 5.12(b). Although not conclusive, the data suggests

that the total one-body loss rate decreases as the 1S density decreases. This decrease in

α1 may be due to a decline in inelastic 1S-2S collision rates, which are proportional to the

ground state density. In principle, the points of Fig. 5.12(a) could be ﬁt to a model which

includes constant one-body decay terms and a term proportional to the 1S density. The

uncertainties in both the determinations of α1 and the density as a function of time are too

large, however, to extract a meaningful value for the total 1S-2S inelastic loss rate without

prior knowledge of the stray electric ﬁeld contribution.

On the other hand, it is possible to establish a conservative upper limit on the

total inelastic contribution α1,inel to the one-body decay rate by subtracting the natural

decay rate from α1:

α1,inel < α1 −

γnat.

In the static approximation, α1,inel can be simply related to the total metastable loss rate

By combining an upper limit for the initial value of α1,inel in a trap with an upper

limit for the ratio V2S/Q12 and the known peak density n1S,o, an upper limit for K12 is

obtained. An upper limit for α1,inel has been estimated for each trap by ﬁrst ﬁtting a line

to α1 as a function of time and then subtracting γnat from the initial value of the ﬁtted
line. In Trap W, for example, the data suggests that α1 may be as large as 18 s−1, implying
an upper limit of 10 s−1 for α1,inel. The ratio V2S /Q12 can be computed numerically using
the Monte Carlo 2S distribution results; it has a maximum value of approximately 3 for

all traps with all probable excitation geometries. Upper limits for K12 are summarized in

Outlook: Spectroscopy of

Metastable Hydrogen

As mentioned in the introduction to this thesis, the ability to produce large, long-

lived clouds of metastable H in a magnetic trap opens the door for a variety of new experi-

ments involving excited states of hydrogen. Of particular interest are spectroscopic experi-

ments involving transitions from the 2S state to higher-lying states (Fig. 6.1). Spectroscopy

of a strong single-photon transition such as the 2S-3P Balmer-α transition will provide a

more sensitive probe of the metastable cloud. Excitation on this transition may also allow

the ﬁrst direct imaging of the metastable cloud. From a fundamental physics standpoint,

the most exciting possibilities of all involve precision spectroscopy of two-photon 2S-nS

transitions [21]. Recent breakthroughs in optical frequency metrology [18] make it more

feasible than ever to measure these frequencies with unprecedented accuracy, leading to

improved values for the Lamb shift and Rydberg constant [12].

This chapter contains a brief discussion of experiments which could feasibly be

carried out in the next few years. Much fruitful work can be done yet with the current

cryogenic apparatus. However, to fully exploit the promise of metastable H spectroscopy, a

new apparatus with more optical access and better detection eﬃciency is desired.

6.1 Further Experiments with the Current Apparatus

6.1.1 Optical Reﬁnements

The principal sources of systematic noise and uncertainty for experiments with

metastables are currently related to the UV excitation laser. There are a number of possible

reﬁnements to the optical apparatus which would dramatically reduce these systematics.

Figure 6.1: Some transitions from the metastable state of hydrogen which can be excited
with readily available diode lasers. Spectroscopy of these transitions in trapped metastable
hydrogen may provide new insight into cold collisions and also fundamental physics.

In the determination of K2 described in Ch. 5, a major source of uncertainty

stemmed from uncertainty in the overlap of the laser focuses along the trap axis. This

overlap can be done empirically by changing the length of the telescope nearest the cryostat

(see Fig. 2.8) and observing the change in metastable signal. Assuming the centroid of

the laser focuses is near the bottom of the trap in z, the signal will be optimized when the

focuses are overlapped. To perform this optimization accurately, the telescope length should

be scanned during a single trap cycle with stable UV power. This could be accomplished

by mounting one of the telescope lenses on a computer-controlled stepper motor. Another

source of uncertainty is the spot size at the laser focuses.

It is diﬃcult to measure the

beam radius at the UV waists directly, but the radius could be inferred more accurately by

measuring the beam proﬁle at several points outside of the cryostat.

On a time scale of seconds to minutes, ﬂuctuations in the transverse overlap of the

laser focuses is probably the most important source of non-statistical noise in our 1S-2S

spectroscopy. Some of this noise is apparently due to the pendulum motion of the 2.5 m-

long cryostat. Greater eﬀorts to mechanically isolate the cryostat from low frequencies may

alleviate this problem. Improving the pointing and transverse mode stability of the UV

beam will also make the task of actively stabilizing the beam overlap in the cryostat much

110

Chapter 6: Outlook: Spectroscopy of Metastable Hydrogen

easier. Currently, much of the noise in the UV beam pointing and mode quality is due to

the instability of the 486 nm dye laser beam which pumps the SHG cavity (Fig. 2.8). The

pointing and mode stability of the dye laser output could be greatly enhanced by spatial

ﬁltering, such as by passing the the beam through a short length of ﬁber. This would come

at the expense of a signiﬁcant amount of power, but the trade-oﬀ of power for stability may

be worthwhile for some experiments.

With a more stable UV laser and less uncertainty in the laser geometry, the decay

measurements described in this thesis could be performed with a better signal-to-noise ratio,

and interpretation of the data would be more straightforward. In general, the geometry of

the metastable cloud could be predicted more accurately, thus reducing a major uncertainty

in the measurement of K2. Another important source of uncertainty, the calibration of the

detection eﬃciency, would also beneﬁt from a better-known and more stable laser geome-

try. However, it may be diﬃcult to signiﬁcantly improve the measurement of K2 or other

collisional parameters without a new method for metastable detection. One possibility is

Balmer-α spectroscopy, discussed below in Sec. 6.1.3.

6.1.2 Excitation Studies

Information about photoionization and two-body loss can be gleaned from studies

of the number of metastables excited as a function of the excitation pulse length. Results

from a preliminary study of this type can be seen in Fig. 6.2. The number of 2S atoms

generated begins to saturate after a few milliseconds. This is consistent with simulations of

excitation behavior which incorporate the theoretical value for the photoionization cross-

section at 243 nm. In cold, dense samples, 2S-2S two-body loss can play an important role

in the saturation behavior as well.

Each point in Fig. 6.2 was measured in a diﬀerent trap cycle. The duty cycle of

the mechanical beam chopper and the timing generator were adjusted between cycles to

produce diﬀerent excitation pulse lengths with a constant wait time between the end of the

excitation pulse and the quench pulse. Such a study requires a couple hours to execute

and is sensitive to drift in mode quality, power, and alignment of the UV beam over this

time scale. A better way to look at the excitation behavior of metastables would be to

use diﬀerent excitation pulse lengths in succession during a single trap cycle. This could be

accomplished using a fast mechanical shutter or a chopper wheel with several diﬀerent-sized

apertures. An AOM could also be used to chop the beam at the expense of about 40% of

the UV power.

Experimental excitation curves measured in diﬀerent traps could be analyzed with

a numerical model incorporating excitation, photoionization, and collisional loss mecha-

nisms. In traps where the metastable density is low enough so that two-body loss is not

important, photoionization will be the principal loss mechanism at high UV powers.

If

geometry and laser power are well known, the data could be analyzed to verify the pho-

toionization cross section. Alternatively, it may be possible to use the theoretical cross

section to calibrate the laser intensity. Finally, in situations where the metastable density

is very large, it may be possible to correct the saturation curve for photoionization and

extract a two-body loss rate. Excitation studies may serve as a useful complement to the

decay measurements described in this thesis.

6.1.3 Balmer-α Spectroscopy

Preliminary work has been completed in the MIT Ultracold Hydrogen Group to-

wards probing the 2S-3P transition with a 656 nm diode laser. The retromirror of the

current trapping cell has a dichroic dieletric coating which is 99% reﬂective at both 243 nm

and 656 nm. Thus, red Balmer-α light can be introduced into the cryostat along the same

path as the UV beam, and the retro-reﬂected red light can be detected using a beam split-

ter outside the cryostat. This is potentially a highly sensitive probe of the metastable

112

Chapter 6: Outlook: Spectroscopy of Metastable Hydrogen

cloud. Alternatively, the absorption of red light can be surmised from the depletion of the

metastable number, observed by quenching and detecting Lyman-α as before.

Diode lasers with free-running wavelengths near 656 nm and output powers up

to 50 mW are commercially available for

$100. The diodes can be induced to operate

∼

at a single frequency in a single transverse mode by optical feedback from an external

grating. The laser frequency can be actively stabilized by piezoelectric control of the grating

angle. With a standard external-cavity grating-stabilized diode laser design, a linewidth

of a few hundred kilohertz is easily achieved [78, 79]. For Balmer-α spectroscopy, it is

convenient to use the 2S-3P saturated absorption lines of a hydrogen discharge as the

frequency reference. The stabilized laser linewidth is small compared to the 30 MHz natural

linewidth of the Balmer-α transition. At 100 µK, the Doppler width is only about 10% of

the natural linewidth, and Zeeman broadening will be insigniﬁcant. Thus, in experiments

with trapped metastables, the experimental Balmer-α linewidth will be approximately the

natural linewidth.

For absorption experiments, the Balmer-α beam waist should be larger than the thermal

radius of the metastable cloud. This will facilitate alignment and allow saturation intensity

to be achieved over most of the atom cloud with a modest laser power. Consider, for

example, a metastable cloud in Trap W, which has a thermal radius of approximately

110 µm.

If the laser radius is three times larger, then the minimum power required for

saturation at the center of the trap is 24 µW. In an absorption experiment, the Balmer-α

laser would be pulsed at a tiny duty cycle, and even at powers far above saturation, the

heating of the trapping cell and cryostat would be negligible.

It should be possible to make absorption measurements which are nearly shot

noise limited. To minimize shot noise, laser pulses can be used which contain only as many

photons as are necessary to excite most of the metastables. For the case of a saturation

power beam with radius three times larger than the thermal radius in Trap W, a

By calibrating the number of photons removed from the Balmer-α beam, it will

be possible to measure the number of metastables in the trap. This may lead to a better

calibration of the detection eﬃciency for metastables by the quenching method. The relative

attenuation of the 656 nm beam will additionally give the column density of the metastable

cloud. Used in combination with the shape of the magnetic trap, this data may allow a

better determination of the spatial distribution of metastables. Spectroscopy of the Balmer-

α line may also provide information about the temperature of the sample. For an accurate

temperature determination, the signal-to-noise ratio will have to be high, since the Doppler

broadening of typical samples is much smaller than the natural 2S-3P linewidth. Other

experiments, such as photoassociation spectroscopy on the 2S-3P transition may become

possible as well.

In the long term, imaging of the metastable cloud using Balmer-α ﬂuorescence may

be the most useful diagnostic of all for trapped metastable hydrogen. The implementation

of an imaging detector, however, will require major changes to the apparatus (Sec. 6.2).

6.1.4 Precision Spectroscopy and Frequency Metrology

In the introduction to this thesis, it was described how the measurement of a 2S-

nS frequency interval, when combined with the accurately known 1S-2S frequency, allows

various contributions to the structure of the hydrogen atom to be deconvolved. With a

sample of cold metastable hydrogen, it should be possible to improve the accuracy of 2S-nS

frequencies by an order of magnitude over the best measurements to date. This will lead

to a corresponding increase in the accuracy of the Rydberg constant and Lamb shift. If the

frequencies of several 2S-nS transitions can be measured precisely, we will have stringent

checks on the understanding of systematic eﬀects.

As a ﬁrst demonstration of two-photon metastable H spectroscopy, the MIT Ultra-

cold Hydrogen Group plans to use light from a 972 nm diode laser to excite the the 2S-4S

transition. To perform Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy, a standing wave is required,

and most likely the current retromirror will have to be replaced with one designed for higher

reﬂectivity at 972 nm. The diode laser technology for this and other 2S-nS transitions is

similar to what was described above for the Balmer-α frequency. The 2S-4S interval diﬀers

114

Chapter 6: Outlook: Spectroscopy of Metastable Hydrogen

by less than 5 GHz from 1/4 of the 1S-2S interval; frequency metrology can be accomplished

by looking at the beat note between the 486 nm dye laser, which is frequency-doubled to

excite the 1S-2S transition, and the second harmonic of the 972 nm laser. Because it has

been calibrated precisely against a cesium standard, the 1S-2S transition serves as a de

facto secondary frequency standard [13].

Stimulated by our need for convenient optical frequency metrology, a new mode-

locked femtosecond laser has recently been developed in the group of F. K¨artner at MIT

[81, 82]. The “double-chirped” mirrors of this laser allow it to produce an extraordinarily

broad comb of frequencies without dispersion-compensating prisms or ﬁber. It will allow

direct comparison of optical frequencies in the range 600-1100 nm. Likely candidates for

precision spectroscopy are the 2S-8S (two photons at 778 nm) and 2S-10S (two photons at

759 nm) transitions, whose frequencies have been measured previously in beam experiments.

In an experiment with cold metastable hydrogen, these frequencies could be calibrated with

the frequency comb and the 972 nm subharmonic of the 1S-2S transition. An alternative

approach is to frequency-triple part of the comb for direct comparison with the 243 nm

frequency.

Based on our studies with metastable hydrogen so far, we can speculate that the

and number (> 4

time, two-body loss will not play a signiﬁcant role in limiting the signal rate; K2 appears

to be roughly a factor of 2 smaller at 230 µK as compared to 90 µK (Fig. 5.11), and the

metastable density is somewhat smaller in the warmer trap as well. The moderate ground

state density in Trap X may also be desired to reduce the complicating eﬀects of cold

collision shifts and inelastic collisions involving 1S atoms.

Before concluding this section, it is worth mentioning that the mode-locked fem-

tosecond laser will also permit a new determination of the 1S-2S absolute frequency. Using

an appropriate optical frequency divider [11], two optical frequencies with an interval hav-

ing a simple relationship to the 1S-2S frequency can be produced inside the range of the

mode-locked laser’s frequency comb. With the apparatus changes described in the next

section, it should be possible to perform 1S-2S spectroscopy with much lower ground state

densities, minimizing the cold collision shift, which is currently the most source of important

systematic error. Provided a primary reference such as a cesium fountain clock, the tran-

sition frequency can potentially be measured with an accuracy surpassing that of H¨ansch

and collaborators [13].

6.2 A Cryogenic Trap Optimized for Optical Studies

A redesign of the magnet system and cryostat to improve optical access and de-

tection solid angle will have many beneﬁts for spectroscopic and other optical studies of

trapped hydrogen. These include better signal-to-noise ratios, easier alignment, more pos-

sible geometries for probe beams, and the potential to use imaging detectors.

Figure 6.3 is a schematic for a possible cryostat and magnet system with a geometry

favorable for optical experiments. The cross section shows eight superconducting “Ioﬀe

bars” which give rise to a radial quadrupole ﬁeld. “Pinch” solenoids above and below the

plane of the page would provide the axial conﬁnement. Spaces between the Ioﬀe bars provide

access for laser beams and detectors. As in the current apparatus, an additional window

on the axis of the trap could allow entry of a retro-reﬂected 243 nm beam for generation of

metastables.

The cryogenic apparatus can be greatly simpliﬁed if we sacriﬁce the ability to

do rf evaporation. Our experiments have shown that large numbers and high densities of

metastables can be produced without rf evaporation of the ground state sample (as in Trap

X, for example). In Fig. 6.3, the trapping cell could be made from a tube of non-magnetic

metal with high thermal conductivity, such as copper. To incorporate four windows as

shown, a square proﬁle may be most convenient. Even more complexity can be avoided
if the cryostat is based on a 3He refrigerator rather than a dilution refrigerator. The
lowest practical temperature of a 3He refrigerator is about 300 mK, which in the present

loading scheme is too warm for the atom cloud to thermally disconnect from the cell walls

(Sec. 2.4.4).

It may be possible, however, to induce thermal disconnect by raising the

magnetic ﬁelds at the walls and forcing magnetic saddlepoint evaporation elsewhere.

It is desirable to reduce both the aspect ratio of the trap and the length of the axial

dimension of the entire apparatus. With more axial compression, the atom clouds would be

more easily probed with transverse laser beams, and the eﬃciency of magnetic saddlepoint

evaporation at low temperatures may be enhanced [83]. If the length of the whole apparatus

can be signiﬁcantly reduced, this will facilitate reduction of ﬂuctuations in the transverse
overlap of the UV beams, currently a major source of noise in our experiments. With a 3He

refrigerator, it may even be possible to mount the entire cryostat on an optical table.

Bringing the detectors close to the atoms and providing them with a large numer-

ical aperture will greatly enhance the detection eﬃciency. Fig. 6.3 depicts an arrangement

where the detectors sit in contact with a liquid nitrogen jacket and can be easily swapped

out, depending on the experiments being performed. With a large detection solid angle,

currently, by a 243 nm laser along the axis of the Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap (oriented into the page
at the center of the trapping cell). One or more probe lasers could be introduced transverse
to the atom cloud. Each of the detectors, anchored at liquid nitrogen temperature, could
be a CCD, PMT array, or MCP detector. The magnet system and detector mounts must
be designed so that magnetic ﬁelds are compatible with the detectors.

Chapter 6: Outlook: Spectroscopy of Metastable Hydrogen

it should be possible to observe the natural two-photon ﬂuorescence decay of metastables

without applying a quench pulse. With Lyman-α detectors, the ﬂuorescence occurring due

to excitation transfer can be observed during the decay of the metastable cloud; the rela-

tive importance of ionization and excitation transfer processes could be unraveled. With a

CCD camera and a Balmer-α source, the metastable cloud can be imaged as in most other

atom trapping experiments. This diagnostic would potentially yield a wealth of information

about the 2S and, indirectly, the 1S samples.

With a much improved detection eﬃciency, it will be possible to do spectroscopy

with signiﬁcantly lower laser powers or signiﬁcantly lower ground state densities than at

present. If lower laser powers are possible, then the UV retromirror could exist outside of

the cryostat, and it could be either vibrationally isolated or actively stabilized to ensure a

stable overlap of the counterpropagating beams. Lower 1S densities are key for minimizing

cold collision shifts.

In particular, the combination of high detection eﬃciency and low

sample density is desired for pushing spectroscopy of the 1S-2S transition to unprecedented

resolution levels.

For spectroscopy of the metastable cloud, the beneﬁts of close optical access to

the atoms on two sides are clear. The necessary beams would be easy to introduce and

align. For one-photon transitions like 2S-3P , single-pass absorption experiments would be

possible. For the the two-photon 2S-nS transitions, the retromirror needed to achieve a

standing wave could be positioned outside the cryostat.

The possibilities for the next generation spectroscopy apparatus are so many, it

may be diﬃcult to choose which ones to pursue. We can be certain, however, that metastable

H has many stories yet to tell us about cold collisions and fundamental physics.

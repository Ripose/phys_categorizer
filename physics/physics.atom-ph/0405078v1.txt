Abstract

A review of methods for ﬁnding general expressions for matrix el-
ements (non-diagonal with respect to conﬁgurations included) of any
one- and two-particle operator for an arbitrary number of shells in an
atomic conﬁguration is given. These methods are compared in various
aspects, and the advantages or shortcomings of each particular method
are discussed. Eﬃcient method to ﬁnd the abovementioned quantities
in LS coupling is presented, based on the use of symmetry properties
of operators and matrix elements in three spaces (orbital, spin and
quasispin), second quantization in coupled tensorial form, graphical
technique and Wick’s theorem. This allows to eﬃciently account for
correlation eﬀects practically for any atom and ion of periodical table.

Introduction

Modern atomic spectroscopy studies the structure and properties of prac-
tically any atom of the periodic table as well as of ions of any ionization
degree. Particular attention is paid to their energy spectra. For the in-
vestigations of many-electron atoms and ions, it is of great importance to
combine experimental and theoretical methods. Nowadays the possibilities
of theoretical spectroscopy are much enlarged thanks to the wide use of
powerful computers. Theoretical methods utilized must be fairly universal
and must ensure reasonably accurate values of physical quantities studied.
Many-electron atom usually is considered as many-body problem and is
described by the wave function constructed from the wave functions of one
electron, moving in the central nuclear charge ﬁeld and in the screening ﬁeld
of the remaining electrons. Then the wave function of this electron may be
represented as a product of radial and spin-angular parts. The radial part is
usually found by solving various modiﬁcations of the Hartree-Fock equations
and can be represented in a numerical or analytical forms (Froese Fischer [1])
whereas the angular part is expressed in terms of spherical functions. Then
the wave function of the whole atom can be constructed in some standard
way (Cowan [2], Jucys and Savukynas [3], Nikitin and Rudzikas [4]) start-
ing with these one-electron functions and may be used further on for the
calculations of any matrix elements representing physical quantities.

For obtaining the values of atomic quantities it is necessary to solve

so-called eigenvalue problem

HΨ = EΨ,

(1)

where Ψ is the wave function of the system under investigation and H is
its Hamiltonian.
In order to obtain accurate values of atomic quantities
it is necessary to account for relativistic and correlation eﬀects. It turned
out that for very large variety of atoms and their ionization degrees the
relativistic eﬀects may be taken into account fairly accurately as Breit-Pauli
corrections (Nikitin and Rudzikas [4], Rudzikas [5]).
It is convenient to
present the Hamiltonian as consisting of two parts in Breit-Pauli approach,
namely,

HBP = HN R + HR,

(2)

where HN R is the non-relativistic Hamiltonian and HR stands for the rela-
tivistic contibution. Non-relativistic Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic

2

(3)

(4)

(5)

energy of electrons T , their potential energy P , and the electrostatic electron
interaction Q

HN R = T + P + Q.

The ﬁrst two terms, T and P are the one-particle operators, whereas the
third term, Q, is two-particle operator. The HR may also be subdivided
into non-ﬁne structure and ﬁne structure contributions

−
The non-ﬁne structure contributions

HR = HN on

F ine + HF ine.

HN on

F ine = HM ass + HD1 + HD2 + HSSC + HOO

−

shift non-relativistic energy levels without any splitting of them. The mass-
velocity term HM ass describes the variation of mass with velocity. The one-
and two-body Darwin (contact) terms HD1 and HD2 are the corrections of
the one-electron Dirac equation due to the retardation of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld produced by an electron (contact interaction). The spin-spin-contact
term HSSC accounts for the interaction of the spin magnetic moments of
two electrons occupying the same space. The orbit-orbit interaction HOO
accounts for the interaction of two orbital moments.

The ﬁne-structure contributions

HF ine = HSO + HSOO + HSS

(6)

split the non-relativistic energy levels (terms) into a series of closely-spaced
levels. The most important of these is the nuclear spin-orbit interaction
HSO (spin-own-orbit) representing the interaction of the spin and angular
magnetic moments of an electron in the ﬁeld of the nucleus. The spin-other-
orbit HSOO and spin-spin HSS contributions in a rough sense may be viewed
as corrections to the nuclear spin-orbit interaction due to the presence of the
other electrons in the system.

Unfortunately, practical calculations show that all realistic atomic Hamil-
tonians do not lead straightforwardly to eigenvalue problem (1). Actually we
have to calculate all non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian considered
including those non-diagonal with respect to electronic conﬁgurations, then
to form energy matrix, to diagonalize it, obtaining in this way the values
of the energy levels as well as the eigenfunctions (the wave functions in the
intermediate coupling scheme). The latter may be used then to calculate

3

electronic transitions as well as the other properties and processes. Such a
necessity raises special requirements for the theory.

The total matrix element of each term of the energy operator in the case
of complex electronic conﬁguration will consist of matrix elements, describ-
ing the interaction inside each shell of equivalent electrons as well as between
these shells. Going beyond the single-conﬁguration approximation we have
to be able to take into account in the same way non-diagonal, with respect
to conﬁgurations, matrix elements.

To ﬁnd the expressions for the matrix elements of all terms of the Hamil-
tonian considered for complex electronic conﬁgurations, having several open
shells, is a task very far from the trivial one. A considerable part of the ef-
fort must be devoted to coping with integrations over spin-angular variables,
occurring in the matrix elements of the operators under consideration. This
paper presents the general methodology, leading to optimal expressions for
operators and matrix elements.

A number of methodologies to calculate the angular parts of matrix
elements exists in literature. Many existing codes for integrating the spin-
angular parts of matrix elements (Glass [6], Glass and Hibbert [7], Grant [8],
Burke et al [9]) are based on the computational scheme proposed by Fano [10].
This methodology is based on having the total wavefunction of an atom built
from the antisymmetrized wavefunctions of separate shells, and this antisym-
metrization is done via coeﬃcients of fractional parentage. The shells are
coupled one to another via their angular momenta. So, the ﬁnding of matrix
elements amounts to ﬁnding the recoupling matrices and the coeﬃcients of
fractional parentage.

Suppose that we have a bra function with u shells in LS coupling:

[9].

(cid:17)

The summation in expression (9) implies that the quantum numbers n,
λ of all participating shells are included. There are four such pairs of n, λ
in the sum.

In essence, the Fano calculation scheme consists of evaluating recou-
pling matrices. Although such an approach uses classical Racah algebra
[11, 12, 13, 14] on the level of coeﬃcients of fractional parentage, it may be
necessary to carry out multiple summations over intermediate terms. Due
to these summations and the complexity of the recoupling matrix itself,
the associated computer codes become rather time consuming. Jucys and
Vizbarait˙e [15] proposed to use the two-electron coeﬃcients of fractioanl
parentage instead of ordinary ones, in matrix elements’ calculations, but
even that did not solve the abovementioned problems. A solution to this
problem was found by Burke et al
[9]. They tabulated separate standard
parts of recoupling matrices along with coeﬃcients of fractional parentage
at the beginning of a calculation and used them further on to calculate the

5

needed coeﬃcients. Computer codes by Glass [6], Glass and Hibbert [7],
Grant [8], Burke et al
[9] utilize the program NJSYM (Burke [16]) or NJ-
GRAF (Bar-Shalom and Klapisch [17]) for the calculation of recoupling ma-
trices. Both are rather time consuming when calculating matrix elements of
complex operators or electronic conﬁgurations with many open shells.

In order to simplify the calculations, Cowan [2] suggested that matrix
elements be grouped into ”Classes” (see Cowan [2] Figure 13-5). Unfor-
tunately, this approach was not generalized to all two-electron operators.
Perhaps for this reason Cowan’s approach is not very popular although the
program itself, based on this approach, is widely used.

Many approaches for the calculation of spin-angular coeﬃcients (Glass [6],
Glass and Hibbert [7], Grant [8], Burke et al
[9]) are based on the usage of
Racah algebra only on the level of coeﬃcients of fractional parentage. A few
authors (Jucys and Savukynas [3], Cowan [2]) utilize the unit tensors, sim-
plifying the calculations in this way, because use can be made of the tables
of unit tensors and selection rules can be used prior to computation to check
whether the spin-angular coeﬃcients are zero or not. Moreover, the recou-
pling matrices themselves have a simpler form. Unfortunately, these ideas
were applied only to diagonal matrix elements with respect to conﬁgurations,
though Cowan [2] suggested the usage of unit tensors for non-diagonal ones
as well.

All the above mentioned approaches were applied in the coordinate repre-
sentation. The second quantization formalism (Judd [18, 19], Rudzikas and
Kaniauskas [20] and Rudzikas [5]) has a number of advantages compared to
coordinate representation. First of all, it is much easier to ﬁnd algebraic
expressions for complex operators and their matrix elements, when rely-
ing on second quantization formalism.
It has contributed signiﬁcantly to
the successful development of perturbation theory (see Lindgren and Morri-
son [21], Merkelis et al [22], and orthogonal operators (Uylings [23]), where
three-particle operators already occur. Uylings [24] suggested a fairly simple
approach for dealing with separate cases of three-particle operators.

Moreover, in the second quantization approach the quasispin formalism
was eﬃciently developed by Innes [25], ˇSpakauskas et al [26, 27], Rudzikas
and Kaniauskas [20], Fano and Rau [28]. The main advantage of this ap-
proach is that applying the quasispin method for calculating the matrix
elements of any operator, we can use all advantages of the new version of
Racah algebra (see Rudzikas [5]) for integration of spin-angular part of any
one- and two-particle operator. For example, the reduced coeﬃcients of frac-
tional parentage are independent of the occupation number of the shell (see
Rudzikas and Kaniauskas [20], Gaigalas et al [29]). All this enabled Merkelis

6

and Gaigalas [30] to work out a general perturbation theory approach for
complex cases of several open shells. In the paper by Merkelis [31] a detailed
review of a version of graphical methodology is presented that allows one to
represent the operators graphically and to ﬁnd the matrix elements of these
operators using diagrammatic technique.

The majority of methods and computer codes of ﬁnding angular coeﬃ-
cients discussed above were faced with a number of problems, the main of
these being:

•

•

•

The high demand of CPU time for calculating the angular parts of ma-
trix elements even on the modern computer. Therefore the high accu-
racy of characteristics of atomic quantities somtimes is even unattain-
able.

The methods are applicable in practice only for the comparatively
simple systems, because in the programs based on classical Racah
algebra the treatment of recoupling matrices is rather complicated,
especialy when ﬁnding the matrix elements of Breit-Pauli operators
between complex conﬁgurations.

The conﬁgurations with open f -shells must often be included in theo-
retical calculations. This causes problems in a number of methodolo-
gies, because the complete account of f - shells implies using a large
number of coeﬃcients of fractional parentage.

Gaigalas and Rudzikas [32], Gaigalas et al [33], Gaigalas et al [34],
Gaigalas et al [29] and Gaigalas and Rudzikas [35] suggested an eﬃcient
and general approach for ﬁnding the spin-angular parts of matrix elements
of atomic interactions, relying on the combination of the second-quantization
approach in the coupled tensorial form, the generalized graphical technique
and angular momentum theory in orbital, spin and quasispin spaces as well
as on the symetry properties of the quantities considered. This approach is
free of previous shortcomings.

It is the main goal of this work to present all this methodology consis-
tently and in a unifying manner, paying the special attention to its main
ideas. Also, we aim at a detailed discussion of obtaining the eﬃcient ten-
sorial expressions of a two-particle operator, as well as the analytical ex-
pressions for recoupling matrices. In addition to that, in this work we aim
at comparing this methodology to other calculation of angular coeﬃcients
schemes.

7

From what is said above we see that the treatment of angular parts of
matrix elements is a many-sided question. The classical scheme by Fano was
developed in various aspects. The methods were developed that used Racah
algebra [11, 12, 13, 14] on a higher level, or used the new version of the Racah
algebra (angular momentum theory in orbital, spin and quasispin spaces)
(see Rudzikas [36]). The ways were searched for, to obtain the expressions
that had simpler recoupling matrices. In order to discuss all that in more
detail, to compare the existing methods of obtaining the angular parts and
to mark the advantages of one method or another, the ﬁnding angular parts
must be looked at from diﬀerent angles.

Thus, the ﬁrst thing to discuss is the expression for any physical op-
erator (see sections 2,3,4), because already the form of it determines the
level of application of tensor algebra in the calculation of matrix elements
of this operator. Also, it is very important to make clear to what extent
the Racah algebra is exploited in one or another methodology of angular
parts treatment. This helps to mark the advantages of one method against
another (see section 5). In addition, it is of importance to compare the ways
of calculating the recoupling matrix in various methods (see section 6).

2 Tensorial Expressions for Two-particle Opera-

tors

It is well known in the literature that a scalar two-particle operator may
be presented the following tensorial form (see Jucys and Savukynas [3],

operator acting in orbital space, and σ1, σ2 are the ranks of operator acting
in spin space.

All the above mentioned approaches were usually applied in the coordi-
nate representation. Now we will investigate into the second quantization
formalism, which is broadly applied in atomic physics as well.

A two-particle operator in second quantization method is written as

In these forms the product of second quantization operators denotes
tensorial part of operator G(κ1κ2k,σ1σ2k). For instance, the tensorial structure
of electrostatic (Coulomb) electron interaction operator is κ1 = κ2 = k, σ1 =
σ2 = 0 (Jucys and Savukynas [3]), and only the two-electron submatrix
of these operators are diﬀerent.

The tensorial expressions for orbit-orbit and other physical operators in

second quantization form may be obtained in the same manner.

It is worth mentioning that the expressions (16) and (17) embrace, al-
ready in an operator form, both the diagonal interaction terms, relative to
conﬁgurations, and the non-diagonal ones. Non-diagonal terms deﬁne the
interaction between all the possible electron distributions over the conﬁg-
urations considered, diﬀering by quantum numbers of not more than two
electrons.

The merits of representing operators in one form or another (16) or (17)
are mostly determined by the technique used to ﬁnd their matrix elements
and quantities in terms of which they are expressed.

In the paper Gaigalas and Rudzikas [32] it was shown that the tensorial
forms (10), (12), (14) of two-particle operator do not take full advantage of
tensor algebra. The most characteristic examples are when conﬁgurations
considered have many open shells, or when the non-diagonal matrix elements
are seeked.

In the paper Gaigalas et al [33] the following optimal expression of two-
particle operator is proposed, which allows one to make the most of the
advantages of Racah algebra (see Racah [11, 12, 13, 14]).

Whereas in traditional expressions, e. g.

over the principle and the orbital quantum numbers of open shells without
detailing these, in the expression written above the ﬁrst term represents the
case of a two-particle operator acting upon the same shell nαλα, the second

diﬀerent.

The tensorial part of a two-particle operator is expressed in terms of oper-
ators of the type A(kk) (nλ, Ξ), B(kk)(nλ, Ξ), C (kk)(nλ, Ξ), D(ls), E(kk)(nλ, Ξ).
They correspond to one of the forms:

For example, if we take a two-particle operator acting upon two shells,
then we see from expression (18) that the angular part of two-particle oper-
ator is expressed via operators B(κ12σ12) (nαλα, Ξ) and C(κ′
12) (nβλβ, Ξ).
G(κ1κ2k,σ1σ2k) acts in such a manner that two

operators of second quantization act upon one shell and two act upon an-
other, the B(κ12σ12) (nαλα, Ξ) and C(κ′
12) (nβλβ, Ξ) are expressed as (20).
But in a case when three operators of second quantization act upon one shell
and one acts upon another, then B(κ12σ12) (nαλα, Ξ) and C(κ′
12) (nβλβ, Ξ)
are expressed either as (19) and (21) or (19) and (22).

In the expression (18) u is the overall number of shells acted upon by
a given tensorial product of creation/annihilation operators. Parameter Ξ
implies the whole array of parameters (and sometimes an internal summation
over some of these is implied, as well) that connect the amplitudes Θ of
tensorial products of creation/annihilation operators in the expression (18)
to these tensorial products (see Gaigalas et al [33]). Also, attention must
be paid to the fact that the ranks κ1, κ2, κ, σ1, σ2 and σ are also included
into the parameter Ξ. The amplitudes Θ (Ξ) are all proportional to the
submatrix element of a two-particle operator g,

To obtain the expression of a concrete physical operator, analogous to
expression (18), the tensorial structure of the operator and the two-particle
matrix elements (26) must be known. We shall investigate this now.

The rest of two-particle Breit-Pauli operators that we did not investigate
so far are the two-body Darwin and spin-spin-contact terms. They do not

The two-body Darwin operator HD2 (see for more detail Nikitin and
Rudzikas [4]), as well as the spin-spin-contact operator HSSC (see Shalit and
Talmi [40] and Feneuille [41]), both have the following tensorial structure:

The expression (18) has a series of terms, and thus at a ﬁrst glance seems
to be diﬃcult to apply. For this purpose in the next sections we shall discuss
in more detail:

•

Obtaining the expression by Wick’s theorem.

The compact written form of all terms, using the extended graphical
technique.

Obtaining the values of recoupling matrix and of the standard quanti-
ties. We shall also compare the existing methodologies of ﬁnding an-
gular parts, showing the advantages and shortcomings of one method-
ology or another.

This methodology is fully applicable also for the one-particle operator
(see Gaigalas and Rudzikas [32], Gaigalas et al [33]). As this operator does
not cause big problems in the atomic physics, we will not stop for its details.

3 Wick’s theorem

Wick’s theorem in the second quantization formalism is formulated as follows

and annihilation operators, then

Usually, Wick’s theorem is applied when treating complex operators that
are represented by a large number of second quantization operators in a non-
normal product form. In atomic physics such operators are used in perturba-
tion theory (see Fetter and Waleˇcka [44]; Lindgren and Morrison [21]; Merke-
lis et al [22]) and in the orthogonal operator method (see Uylings [23]). Most
often the Wick’s theorem is applied to the products of second quantization
operators that are not tensorially coupled (see Lindgren and Morrison [21]).
While applying the perturbation theory in an extended model space, two
diﬀerent groups of second quantization operators are deﬁned (see for details
in Lindgren and Morrison [21]). The second quantization operators acting
upon core states belong to one group, whereas the operators acting upon
open and excited shells belong to another one. These two groups are very
diﬀerent in applying Wick’s theorem to them.

17

In the ﬁrst group, the creation operators are re-named to annihilation
operators and are called the hole absorption operators, while the annihilation
operators are re-named to creation operators and are called the hole creation
operators. The creation operators of the second group are called the particle
creation operators, while annihilation ones are called the particle absorption
operators. Such a division of second quantization operators into two groups
is called the particle-hole formalism.

Merkelis et al [22] have proposed to use the so-called graphical ana-
logue of Wick’s theorem in perturbation theory (see Gaigalas et al [45],
Gaigalas [46]). It is an eﬃcient tool for obtaining the normal products of
second quantization operators in a coupled tensorial form. Before applying
this theorem, particular second quantization terms are in a normal product
in coupled form. In addition, this theorem is applied in the particle-hole
formalism, too (see Merkelis et al [22], Merkelis et al [47]).

In all the cases mentioned above, the Wick’s theorem is applied for the
most general case of operators, i.e. the shells that are acted upon are not
detailed. But, in the case of the extended model space, the group that
the second quantization operators belong to, depending on the electronic
structure of atom or ion under investigation, is deﬁned.

Wick’s theorem is not applied in investigations of ordinary physical op-
erators. Gaigalas et al [33] proposed a new version of the Wick’s theorem
application, where the optimal tensorial expression of any two-particle op-
erator is easily obtained. The speciﬁcity of Wick’s theorem application in
this case lies in applying it only when the shells that are acted upon by
the secondary quantization operators are known, i.e.
it is applied for each
G(ij, i′j′) separately. Such an interpretation of Wick’s theorem bears
term
similarity with the particle-hole formalism. The only diﬀerence is that in
this case the second quantization operators are diﬀerentiated formally not
on the basis of structure of atom under investigation, but on the basis of
shells acted upon.

b

This is done in the following way. The second quantization operators
acting upon a shell with a lowest index are attributed to the ﬁrst group.
Those acting upon a shell with a next-lowest index are attributed to the
second group, etc. In the most general case we have four distinct groups.

For example, suppose we have a two-particle operator

G(25, 32) = 1

must obtain. Then the operators acting upon the second shell are attributed
to the ﬁrst group, the ones acting upon the third shell - to the second, and
the ones acting upon the ﬁfth - to the third group.

|

and

Assuming that all the operators from ﬁrst group are the creation ones,
and the rest are annihilation operators, we apply the Wick’s theorem. Thus
we obtain that the operators from the ﬁrst group are one beside another,
and all are positioned after the operators from the ﬁrst group. Thus we
obtain:

−

a2a†2a5a†3.
After that, we apply Wick’s theorem assuming that the operators from
the ﬁrst and the second groups are creation ones, and the rest of them are
annihilation operators. Thus we obtain that the operators from the second
group are one beside another, and all are positioned after the ﬁrst group
operators:

(48)

a2a†2a†3a5.

(49)

If in the product that we investigate there are operators of second quan-
tization acting upon four distinct shells, then we apply Wick’s theorem once
again, assuming that operators from the ﬁrst, second and third groups are
creation ones, and from the fourth group - annihilation ones. In this case the
Wick’s theorem is applied to the second quantization operators in uncoupled
form.

From (11) we see that in second quantization a two-particle operator is
written as a sum, where parameters i, j, i′, j′ run over all possible arrays
of quantum numbers. So, the greater the number of open shells in bra and
G(ij, i′j′) in the expression of
ket functions, the greater the number of terms
two-particle operator. It is obvious that all these terms must be systematized
in order to obtain in general case the most eﬃcient tensorial expression of a
two-particle operator, in the way described above.

In the work by Gaigalas et al [33] it is chosen an optimal number of
distributions, which is necessary to obtain the matrix elements of any two-
particle operator, when the bra and ket functions consist of arbitrary number
of shells. This is presented in Table 1. We point out that for distributions 2-5
and 19-42 the shells’ sequence numbers α, β, γ, δ (in bra and ket functions
of a submatrix element) satisfy the condition α < β < γ < δ, while for
distributions 6-18 no conditions upon α, β, γ, δ are imposed (This permits
to reduce the number of distributions). For distributions 19-42 this condition

21

is imposed only for obtaining simple analytical expressions for the recoupling
. This will be discussed in more detail

So, in the way that is described earlier, the Wick’s theorem is applied,

and δ belong to diﬀerent groups.

evidence of superiority of the obtained tensorial expressions against other
expressions known in the literature.

The methodology presented in this section demonstrates the way to ob-
tain optimal arrangement of the second quantization operators, for any two-
particle operator. It can be applied without restrictions for obtaining the
optimal tensorial form of two-particle terms of orthogonal operators and of
perturbation theory operators, too.

4 Graphical methods for two-particle operator

The graphical technique of angular momentum is widely used in the atomic
physics: see Yutsis et al [48], Jucys and Bandzaitis [49], Brink and Satcher [50],
El-Baz [51]. It is applied eﬃciently both in the coordinate representation
(see for example Jucys and Bandzaitis [49]), and in the second quantiza-
tion formalism (Gaigalas et al [52]). The use of it allows one to obtain the
analytical expressions for the recoupling matrices conveniently (see for ex-
ample Kaniauskas and Rudzikas [53]), to investigate the tensorial products
of operators (see for example Jucys et al [54]), and to seek for the matrix
elements of operators (see for example Huang and Starace [55]). Gaigalas
and Merkelis [52] have proposed a graphical way to obtain the values of ma-
trix elements when the operator is a many-particle (one-, two-, three-, etc.)
one and has irreducible tensorial form. For example, when a two-particle
operator is considered, it has the form (12) or (14). The matrix elements
in this methodology are expressed not only in the terms of coeﬃcients of
fractional parentage or reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage, but in
terms of standard quantities U k and V k1, too. Gaigalas et al [33] have pro-
posed to calculate the matrix elements by using the tensorial expressions
for such two-particle operator, that take full advantage of Racah algebra.
In this case the tensorial form of operator depends on the shells that the
operator acts upon (distributions 1-42 from Table 1). This is the diﬀerence
of this methodology from other. It is most convenient to obtain the tensorial

22

expressions for 42 distributions graphically, using the generalized graphical
technique by Gaigalas et al [52].
In such a case not only the similarities
between diﬀerent distributions are easily seen, but also the compact graph-
ical representation of the obtained expressions is possible. We will stop for
details on this in the present section.

A two-particle operator may be represented graphically by a Feynman-
Goldstone diagram D1 from Figure 1 (Lindgren and Morrison [21]). As it
is shown in the paper Bolotin et al [56], the Feynman-Goldstone diagrams
are topologically equivalent to the angular momentum graphs. Due to that,
an irreducible tensorial form for every Feynman-Goldstone diagram may be
obtained (see Merkelis et al [47]). The graph D2 is the angular momentum
graph corresponding to the diagram D1. So the two-particle operator will
be written down as follows:

also to be said about the remaining operators of second quantization and
the three open lines af graph D2.

As it has been mentiond in section 2, this operator has two tensorial
forms, (12) and (13). These may be represented graphically, since the cre-

ation operator a(λi), as well as operator ∼a

We emphasize here that the winding line of interaction in the Feynman-
Goldstone diagram corresponds to the operators of second quantization in
the normal order (Figure 1, D1). Whereas the dotted interaction line indi-
cates that the second quantization operators are ordered in pairs of creation-
annihilation operators. In the latter case ﬁrst comes the pair on the left side
of a Feynman-Goldstone diagram (Figure 1, D5). Such a notation of two
kinds for an interaction line is meaningful only for two-particle (or more)
operators, since for any one-particle operator both the winding and dotted
lines correspond to the same order of creation and annihilation operators.

From expressions (51), (52) we see that the two-particle operator in the
ﬁrst form is represented by one Feynman-Goldstone diagram D1, whereas
in the second - by two diagrams D5 and D7. The diagrams, corresponding
to tensorial product, have the following algebraic expressions:

The positions of the second quantization operators in the diagrams D6,
D8 and D9 deﬁne their order in tensorial products: the ﬁrst place in ten-
sorial product occupies the upper right second quantization operator, the
second - lower right, after them the upper left and lower left operators follow.
The angular momenta diagram deﬁnes their coupling scheme into tensorial
product. For more detail see Gaigalas and Rudzikas [32].

As it has been mentioned earlier, these two forms do not always take
full advantage of the Racah algebra (see Gaigalas and Rudzikas [32]). The
expression (18) has no such shortcomings. Now we will demonstrate the
way to obtain graphically a tensorial expressions for particular distributions
1-42 from Table 1.

We take the distribution γ, β, α, γ (13 form Table 1) as an example for
investigation. Then the Feynman-Goldstone diagram of operator
G(γβ, αγ)
is D10, the angular momentum graph is D11, and the second quantization
operators are in the following order:

b

aγaβa†αa†γ.

(56)

Applying the Wick’s theorem as described in Section 3, and assuming that
the operators acting upon shell γ belong to the ﬁrst group, the once acting
upon β belong to the second, and the ones acting upon α belong to the third
group, we obtain the following order of operators:

aγa†γaβa†α.

(57)

Using the generalized graphical technique of angular momentum by Gaigalas
et al [45], we couple the operators of second quantization into tensorial
product D12 (see Figure 3):

In the course of obtaining D12 graphically, a recoupling matrix D13 appears,
whose analytical expression is readily obtained by using the graphical tech-
nique of Jucys and Bandzaitis [49]. All the needed expressions are obtained
in the same way.

In obtaining these expressions, as well as in representing them graphi-
cally, it is very convenient to use the rule of changing the sign of a node,
existing in the graphical technique of angular momentum (see Jucys and
Bandzaitis [49]). Therefore now we will treat an example of using such a
rule.

Suppose, we have the following correspondence between diagrams (Fig-

ure 3):

D15,

D14 −→

(59)
in which the second quantization operators are in the order a(λ3) ˜a(λ4) a(λ1)
˜a(λ2). Our goal is to obtain the diagram corresponding to the order a(λ1)
˜a(λ2) a(λ3) ˜a(λ4). Bearing in mind that the second quantization operators
anticommute with each other and they all act on diﬀerent electronic shells
and we are not changing the order of their coupling into tensorial product,
we arrive at

D14 −→

(
−

1)4D16 = D16.

(60)

Let us also discuss another situation: we have deﬁned the disposition
of the operators and we want to couple them into certain tensorial prod-
uct. Suppose that we want to represent graphically the following tensorial
product:

For this purpose we have to rearrange the generalized Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcient, which is deﬁning the scheme of coupling of the operators into the
tensorial product. It is easy to notice that this coeﬃcient will properly deﬁne

The procedures described are fairly simple, however, they are suﬃcient
for the majority of cases. The more complete description of this general-
ized graphical approach may be found in Gaigalas et al [45], Gaigalas [46],
Gaigalas and Merkelis [52].

All the analytical expressions for distributions 1 - 42 from Table 1 are
presented in the paper Gaigalas et al [33]. They are written down using the
generalized graphical methodology of angular momentum, and the vortex
sign change rule, which was discussed in this section. As a consequence
of that, the analytical expressions for 42 terms may be written down via 6
diﬀerent expressions. This, undoubtedly, facilitates a lot the implementation
of methodology proposed in Gaigalas et al [33].

5 Matrix Elements Between Complex Conﬁgura-

tions

In this section we will discuss several ways to obtain matrix elements of
a two-particle operator. As it was mentioned earlier, up to now the Fano
calculation scheme [10] is the most popular one. Its general expression when
a two-particle operator acts upon diﬀerent shells is presented in (9).

The general expression for a matrix element in other cases is similar. For

example, when the operator acts only upon one shell, we have

we see that the Racah algebra in expressions (9), (63) is used only on the
level of coeﬃcients of fractional parentage.
In separate cases, e.g. when
the two-particle operator acts upon one or two shells, it is possible to use
expressions which exploit the Racah algebra at a higher level, i.e. to take
more advantage of the tensor algebra elements (see Judd [57], Jucys and
Savukynas [3]). For example, let us investigate the case when a matrix
element is calculated for bra and ket functions having one shell only. The
tensorial forms (12) and (14) are of value here. Taking the second one of

Using the relationships between the tensorial product of creation and an-
nihilation operators and the tensorial quantities U k and V k1 (see Rudzikas
and Kaniauskas [20]), the expression (65) for matrix elements can be writen
down in terms of U k and V k1. In comparing (63) to (65) we see that the

ready performed in expression (65). So, in this case the Racah algebra
is exploited at the level of standard quantities U k ir V k1. This simpliﬁes
calculations a lot:

For zero matrix elements are easily tracked down from triangular con-
ditions even before the actual calculation is performed. In case (65)
only the triangular conditions δ(L, k, L′) and δ(S, k, S′) are present,
but their number may be greater in other cases. (In the above, the no-
L+L′.)
tation δ(L, k, L′) means the triangular condition

The tables of standard quantities (see Nielson and Koster [58], Karazija
et al [59], Cowan [2]) may be used.

The recoupling matrix is simpler in this case, and it has an analytical
expression.

So, the expressions exploiting the Racah algebra at the level of U k and
V k1 are much more advantageous than (9). Such expressions are obtained
for all physical operators. For example, the expressions for spin-other-orbit
operator are presented in papers Horie [60], Karazija et al [61] and Vizbarait˙e
et al [62], the ones for spin-spin operator - in papers Horie [60] and Karazija
et al [63], and the ones for orbit-orbit operator in the monograph Jucys and
Savukynas [3]. The shortcoming of the expressions of this type is that the
Racah algebra is exploited to its full extent in separate cases only. This is
discussed in detail in paper by Gaigalas et al [32].

we shall analyse the submatrix element T

we will discuss the derivation of submatrix elements of these operators, and
present the expressions for these quantities. It is worth noting that these
tensorial quantities all act upon the same shell. So, all the advantages of
tensor algebra and the quasispin formalism may be exploited eﬃciently.

where F (κ1σ1) (nλ), G(κ2σ2) (nλ) are one of (19) or (20) and the submatrix
elements correspondingly are deﬁned by (67), (68) and (69). N ′′ is deﬁned by
the second quantization operators occurring in F (κ1σ1) (nλ) and G(κ2σ2) (nλ).
As is seen, by using this approach Gaigalas et al [29], the calculation of
the angular parts of matrix elements between functions with u open shells
is reduced to requiring the reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage or
the tensors (for example W (ǫk1k2) (nl, nl)), which are independent of the
occupation number of the shell and are acting on one shell of equivalent
electrons.

The main advantage of this approach is that the standard data tables
in such a case will be much smaller in comparison with tables of the usual
coeﬃcients U k, V k1k2 (see Jucys and Savukynas [3]) and, therefore, many
summations will be less time-consuming. Also one can see that in such an
approach the submatrix elements of standard tensors and subcoeﬃcients
of fractional parentage actually can be treated in a uniform way as they
all are the completely reduced matrix elements of the second quantization
operators. Hence, all methodology of calculation of matrix elements will be
much more universal in comparison with the traditional one (see Cowan [2],
Jucys and Savukynas [3], Wybourne [64]).

6 Recoupling Matrix

While seeking the matrix elements of one- or two- particle operators, it is
necessary to obtain the values of a recoupling matrix

al [33] (see expresion (66)), or the recoupling matrices
λi, λj, λ′i, λ′j, κ1, κ2, κ, σ1, σ2, σ, Λbra, Λket
and
(cid:16)
λi, λj, λ′i, λ′j, κ1, κ2, κ, σ1, σ2, σ, Λbra, Λket
(cid:16)

, if we use the methodol-
ogy by Fano [10] (see expresion (9)). In the case of several open shells the
expressions for matrix elements of every physical operator are published,
where the recoupling matrices are in the form of simple factors. Usually all
these are written in the coordinate representation. They can be found in
Karazija et al [59], Jucys and Savukynas [3], Karazija [65], Rudzikas [20].

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

Meanwhile, for the more complex conﬁgurations, i.e. the ones having
many shells, the recoupling matrices are much more complicated. Beside
that, the complexity of a two-particle operator adds to this. When the ten-
sorial structure of an operator is complex, the recoupling matrix is rather
complex, too, e.g. the spin-other-orbit operator (see Gaigalas [34]). While
attempting to calculate the angular part of matrix elements in all the men-
tioned cases, a general methodology for calculating the recoupling matrices
is necessary. It has to be eﬃcient, too, because the speed of calculation of
angular parts of matrix elements depends on that.

The majority of methodologies to obtain angular parts are based on
the Fano [10] calculation scheme (see for example Glass [6], Glass and Hi-
bbert [7], Grant [8]). In ﬁnding the matrix elements using this, one of the
tasks is to obtain the recoupling matrices for direct and exchange terms.

Let us treat a matrix element of a two-particle operator acting upon four

distinct shells

For such an operator, the recoupling matrix in L - space, using graphical
technique of Jucys and Bandzaitis [49], is represented in Figure 4. As we
speak of calculations in LS - coupling, the analogous recoupling matrix in
S - space has to be calculated. In the Figure 4 the tree containing B nodes
represents the bra function, and the one with K nodes represents the ket
function. Bra, as well as ket function, both contain u open shells in this
case.

Now let us treat a case when three distinct shells are acted upon by the

35

Figure 4: The recoupling matrix for the Fano angular calculation scheme.

b

operator. For example, the matrix element of operator
G(ij, ij′) is sought.
Then in the recoupling matrix the node III will be on Li line (see Figure 4).
This means that there will be two nodes on the resulting orbital moment Li
line of shell i. These will be nodes I and III. The resulting orbital moment
Li of the shell i of bra function is attributed to the line connecting nodes
Bi and I. The resulting orbital moment L′i of the shell i of ket function is
attributed to the line between nodes III and Ki. Finally, characteristics
L′′i of all possible intermediate momenta for that particular shell, which are
summed over, are attributed to the line between nodes I and III. So, in
treating the operator acting upon three distinct shells, an intermediate sum
in the recoupling matrix appears. Similarly, two intermediate sums occur
when two distinct shells are acted upon by the operator. And when it acts
upon one shell only, three intermediate sums are present. The lines k, k′ and
K in the recoupling matrix represent the structure of two- particle operator
in l - space. See Tutlys [66], Grant [8] for details.

This is also valid for the exchange term, only the line li′ must be con-

nected to the node D, and line lj′ - to the node C.

The ﬁrst program to calculate the recoupling matrices of this type,
It performs the calculations in two

NJSYM, was written by Burke [16].

36

stages: 1) the recoupling matrix is expressed as a sum of products of the 6j
- coeﬃcients; 2) this expression is used in calculation.

Tutlys [66] wrote a program to calculate angular parts of matrix ele-
ments, ANGULA, which expressed the recoupling matrix in terms of Clebsch
- Gordan coeﬃcients before the actual calculations. While ﬁnding the recou-
pling matrix by the Clebsch - Gordan coeﬃcient summation, this program
eliminates trivial coeﬃcients from the expression.

Bar-Shalom and Klapisch [17] developed a new program NJGRAF. This
program calculates the recoupling matrix in several stages. On the basis of
graphical methodology by Yutsis, Levinson and Vanagas [48], the recoupling
matrix is analysed graphically and an optimal expression is found. After-
wards, the value of recoupling matrix itself is calculated. An analogous
program RECOUP was written by Lima [67], and a program NEWGRAPH
was written by Fack et al [68]. All these (NJGRAF, RECOUP and NEW-
GRAPH) are based on the same principle. An optimal analytical expression
for the recoupling matrix is obtained by graphical method, and then the
calculations are carried out according to it. But the optimal expressions
they ﬁnd are diﬀerent quite often, and are not really optimal.

As it was mentioned above, the methodology of angular calculation based
on the Fano calculation scheme has a shortcoming that the intermediate
sums appear in complex recoupling matrices. Due to these summations
and the complexity of the recoupling matrix itself, the associated computer
codes become rather time consuming. A solution to this problem was found
by Burke et al [9]. They tabulated separate standard parts of recoupling
matrices along with coeﬃcients of fractional parentage at the beginning of
a calculation and then used them later to calculate the coeﬃcients needed.
Computer codes by Glass [6], Glass and Hibbert [7], Burke et al [9],
Fischer [69], Fischer [70] and Dyall et al [71] utilize the program NJSYM
(Burke [16]) or NJGRAF (Bar-Shalom and Klapisch [17]) for the calculation
of recoupling matrices. Both are rather time consuming when calculating
matrix elements of complex operators or electronic conﬁgurations when cal-
culating matrix elements of complex operators or electronic conﬁgurations
with many open shells. In order to simplify the calculations, Cowan [2] sug-
gested grouping matrix elements into ’classes’ (see Cowan [2], Figure 13-15).
Unfortunately this approach was not generalized to all two-electron opera-
tors. Perhaps this is the reason why Cowan’s approach is not widely used
although the program itself, based on this approach is widely used.

Gaigalas et al [33] proposed a methodology where the analytical expres-
sions for recoupling matrices are obtained for the most general case.
In
this methodology, analogically as in Cowan [2], the matrix elements are at-

tributed to four diﬀerent groups. The operators acting upon only one shell
belong to the ﬁrst group (distribution 1 from Table 1), the ones acting upon
two - to the second (distributions 2 - 10 from Table 1), upon three - to the
third (distributions 11 - 18 from Table 1), and upon four - to the fourth
group (distributions 19 - 42 from Table 1) respectively. Each group has a
diﬀerent recoupling matrix, R1 - R2. They all are shown in Figures 5 - 8.

6.1 One interacting shell

Let us treat the recoupling matrix R1 ﬁrst (see Figure 5). It represents the
case when a physical two-particle operator acts upon a single shell. Here,
similarly as in Figure 4, the graphical technique of Jucys and Bandzaitis [49]
is used. The bra and ket functions are represented as in Figure 4. As the
two-particle operator acts upon only one shell in this case, this operator
may be treated as a single - particle one from the recoupling matrix point of
view. Using a graphical rule allowing one to cut two lines and connect the
loose ends, we disconnect the nodes B1 and K1 from the general recoupling
matrix. The part separated from recoupling corresponds to delta - functions

possible to cut all the nodes until Bi and K ′i out of the general recoupling

While investigating the recoupling matrix (see Figure 6) it is easy to
notice that there is an additional graphic element. After cutting this out,
we get a diagram the further investigation of which is very similar to the
investigation of R1. That additional matrix element is

the diagram under investigation is split into two diagrams closely resembling
the recoupling matrix R1. As they are cut in the very same way as R1 is,
we will not stop at recoupling matrix R2 for details.

6.3 Three interacting shells

In the methodology presented in Gaigalas et al [33], the recoupling matrix is
represented by a diagram R3 (see Figure 7) when the two-particle operator
is acting upon three shells. Similarly as for the recoupling matrix R2, the
cutting out of nodes Bj, II, III and Kj leads to a diagram A2(

Four interacting shells

The most complex recoupling matrix R4 (see Figure 8) comes into view
when all the second quantization operators act upon diﬀerent shells. The
part of this recoupling matrix from nodes B1 and K1 to nodes Bi′ and Ki′,
and also from nodes Bj′ and Kj′ to nodes Bu and Ku is very similar to
the recoupling matrices described above, therefore their investigation is the
same as that of the diagrams described earlier. We will investigate in more
detail the part of diagram from nodes Bi′ and Ki′ to nodes Bj′ and Kj′.
That is pictured in Figure 11. After cutting the diagram across four lines
L12...i′, K4, K3 and L′12...i′ and connecting these according the graphical
technique of Jucys and Bandzaitis [49] with a generalized Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcient, then connecting the lines L12...i′
1 with an
ordinary Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient, we obtain a diagram which is expressed
via two 6j-coeﬃcients. The exact analytical expression of this diagram is
presented in the paper by Gaigalas et al [33] (see expresion (29)).

and Bandzaitis [49] technique, we obtain a diagram which corresponds to a
12j- coeﬃcient. The analytical expression of that is presented in paper by
Gaigalas et al [33], expr. (31).

If a shell nj′lj′ is beside shell ni′li′, i.e. there are no additional nodes
between nodes Bi′, Ki′ and Bj′, Kj′, then the additional graphical elements
vanish. So, we obtained the full analytical expression of recoupling matrix
R4. If between the abovementioned shells a single additional shell is present,
then we obtain an additional diagram which is expressed as a product of two
6j-coeﬃcients (see (30) from Gaigalas et al [33]). If the number of shells is
greater, then the obatined diagram in the most general case is written via
(32) from Gaigalas et al [33].

7 Conclusion

The methodology that is based on the second quantization in coupled ten-
sorial form, on the angular momentum theory in three spaces (orbital, spin
and quasispin), on the Wick’s theorem and on the generalized graphical
technique of angular momentum, give the possibility to eﬃciently calcu-
late the matrix elements of energy operators in general case (Gaigalas and

45

Rudzikas [32], Gaigalas et al [33], this paper). The main ideas of this
methodology are:

1. A number of theoretical methods is known in atomic physics that fa-
cilitate a lot the treatment of angular part of matrix elements. These
are the theory of angular momentum, its graphical representation,
the quasispin, the second quantization and its coupled tensorial form.
But while treating the matrix elements of physical operators in gen-
eral, the methods mentiond above are applied only some part, or very
ineﬃciently.

An idea is presented and carried out in the work Gaigalas and Rudzikas [32],
Gaigalas et al [33] and this paper, of unifying all these methods in order
to optimize the way to treat matrix elements of physical operators, to
investigate eﬃciently even the most complex cases of atoms and ions.

2. The Wick’s theorem is widely known in the theory of atom. Up to now
it was applied to the most general products of the operators of sec-
ond quantization, i.e. when the particular arrays of quantum numbers
for each operator of second quantization were not yet deﬁned. In the
methodology described there is proposed to apply the Wick’s theorem
for the products of second quantization operators where they have the
values of quantum numbers already deﬁned. This allows one, using
the methodology of second quantization in coupled tensorial form, to
abtain immediately the optimal tensorial expressions for any opera-
tor. Then, in treting the matrix elements of physical operators, the
advantages of a new modiﬁcation of the Racah algebra are exploited
to their full extent.

3. While analysing the physical operators presented as products of ten-

W (k′

W (kqklks)](KqKlKs), [W (kqklks)

sors a(qsl), W (kqklks), [a(qsl)
s)](KqKlKs), it is possible to obtain convenient an-
[W (kqklks)
alytical expressions for recoupling matrices that must be taken into
account in ﬁnding the matrix elements (non-diagonal with respect to
conﬁguration included) of any physical operator between complex con-
ﬁgurations (with any number of open shells).

a(qsl)](KqKlKs),

4. An idea is proposed and carried out, concerning the most eﬃcient way
to apply the tensor algebra and the quasispin formalism in the most
general case, for the diagonal and the non-diagonal matrix elements
as well, when the bra- and ket- functions have any number of open
shells.

46

The combination of all these improvements allows to eﬃciently account

for correlation efects practically for any atom or ion of periodical table.

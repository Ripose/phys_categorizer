We present an introduction to the principles behind atomic energy level calculations with Quan-
tum Electrodynamics (QED) and the two-time Green’s function method; this method allows one
to calculate an eﬀective Hamiltonian that contains all QED eﬀects and that can be used to predict
QED Lamb shifts of degenerate, quasidegenerate and isolated atomic levels.

INTRODUCTION

This contribution is concerned with the evaluation of atomic energy levels with QED. Such an evaluation yields
stringent tests of QED in strong electric ﬁelds, whereas g-factor experiments and calculations currently probe QED
in situations where the magnetic ﬁeld can be treated perturbatively

The nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld experienced by the inner levels of highly-charged ions makes the electrons reach relativistic
velocities. Such simple physical systems are thus particularly interesting for testing relativistic eﬀects in quantum
systems (for example, see Refs. [1,2] for experimental results with lithiumlike ions). Theoretical predictions of energy
levels in such systems obviously require the use of QED.

Experiments have reached an accuracy that shows that extremely accurate evaluations of QED eﬀects are also
needed in helium. Experiments performed during the last ten years in the spectroscopy of this atom have become two
orders of magnitude more precise than the current theoretical calculations (see for instance Refs. [3,4] and references
therein).

Several experiments are now focusing on helium and heliumlike ions, and especially their 1s2p 3PJ ﬁne structure [5–8]
such experiments have implications in metrology, as they could provide a measurement the ﬁne structure constant and
provide checks of theoretical higher-order eﬀects. Very precise theoretical calculations of energy levels in heliumlike
ions can be also important in the investigation of parity violation [9].

Predictions of energy levels are usually more diﬃcult to obtain for states with one or more open shells (retardation
in the interaction and exchange of electrons must be included, and there can be quasidegenerate levels). Only a few
calculations of excited energy levels in heliumlike and lithiumlike ions have been performed up to now; the ﬁrst results
have been published quite recently [10–12]. In regards to QED shifts of quasidegenerate levels, they have only been
obtained this year for the ﬁrst time [11], with the help of the method that we present in this talk.

THEORETICAL METHODS

As is well known, relativistic electrons orbiting a nucleus are well treated with the Dirac equation, in which the
nucleus can be considered as point-like or not. We thus treat the binding to the nucleus non-perturbatively by using
“Bound-State QED” [13,14] (the coupling constant of the nucleus-electron interaction is Zα, which is not small for
highly-charged ions). In this formalism, however, QED eﬀects are taken into account by treating the electron-electron
interaction perturbatively (with coupling constant α), and both the electron and photon ﬁelds are quantum ﬁelds (i.e.,
in second -quantized form); the only diﬀerence with the free-ﬁeld case used in high-energy physics is that electronic
creation and annihilation operators create and destroy atomic states instead of free particles.

A few methods allow one to extract energy levels from the Bound-State QED Hamiltonian: the two-time Green’s
function method [15–17], the method being developed by Lindgren (based on Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation
Theory merged with QED) [18,19], the adiabatic S-matrix formalism of Gell-Mann, Low and Sucher [20], and the
evolution operator method [21,22]. Some other methods yield atomic energy levels, but they include QED eﬀects
only partly or approximately (such as the multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock method [23], conﬁguration interaction calcu-
lations [24] and relativistic many-body perturbation theory [25]).

However, only two methods can in principle be employed in order to calculate energy levels of quasidegenerate
atomic states [e.g., the (2s2p1/2)1 and the (2s2p3/2)1 levels in heliumlike ions, which are experimentally important]:
the two-time Green’s function method and the method being elaborated by Lindgren. We present in this talk a non-
technical introduction to the ﬁrst method. The two-time Green’s function method has also the advantage of yielding
a simpler renormalization procedure than the Gell-Mann–Low–Sucher method in the case of degenerate levels [26,27].

THE TWO-TIME GREEN’S FUNCTION METHOD

All the methods that extract atomic energy levels from the Bound-State QED Hamiltonian study the propagation

of electrons between two diﬀerent times. The methods diﬀer in the number of inﬁnite times used:

(a) in the Gell-Mann–Low–Sucher method, the atomic state under consideration evolves from time −∞ to time
+∞ with an adiabatic switching of the interaction; (b) in Lindgren’s formalism [18,19], the evolution is from time
−∞ to time 0, which avoids problems associated with the two inﬁnite times in the S-matrix approach of Gell-Mann–
Low–Sucher; (c) in the two-time Green’s function method, that we present here, the adiabatic switching is completely
avoided by studying the propagation of electrons between two ﬁnite times. We note that adiabatic switching of the
interactions is physically motivated in the study of collisions between particles that start very far from each other,
but this switching is not so easily related to the physical description of the orbiting electrons of an atom.

FIG. 1. The two-time Green’s function represents the probability amplitude for going from one position of the electrons to

another position.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian derived from QED by the two-time Green’s function method has matrix elements be-
tween the various degenerate and/or quasidegenerate states under study; the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the
atomic energy levels predicted by QED (to a given order). This eﬀective Hamiltonian is however not associated to a
Schr¨odinger equation of motion; our Hamiltonian is equivalent to the submatrix used in the perturbation theory of
degenerate and quasidegenerate states; in this respect, the approach of the two-time Green’s function method diﬀers
from the spirit of the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

The QED Hamiltonian of the method is deﬁned with the help of a Green’s function that represents the propagation
of N electrons between two diﬀerent (ﬁnite) times (N is the number of electrons of the atom or ion that we want to
study); this propagation is represented in Fig. 1.

(cid:13)
The energy levels of an N -electron ion or atom can be recovered by studying the energy representation GN (E)
of the Green’s function, i.e., by doing a Fourier transform: this function has (simple) poles at the atomic energy
levels [15–17]. Such a result is similar to the K¨all´en-Lehmann representation [28]. As an example, Fig. 2 depicts the
poles of the two-particle Green’s function.

The two-time Green’s function method provides a way of mathematically extracting from the Green’s function the
positions of the poles, i.e., the atomic energy levels [17]; the procedure handles degenerate and quasidegenerate atomic
levels without any special diﬃculty [29]. One of the basic ideas behind the pole extraction is found in the following
mathematical device, which uses any contour Γ0 that encloses the pole in order to ﬁnd its exact position:
if the
function g(E) has a simple pole at E = E0, then we have from complex analysis

IΓ0

E0 =

dE E × g(E)

;

(1)

the contour Γ0 is only required to encircle the pole and to be positively oriented, as shown in Fig. 3. Since the Green’s
function has simple poles at the atomic energy levels [17], Eq. (1) is a way of obtaining them.

FIG. 3. The exact atomic energies can be recovered through a contour integration of the Green’s function.

When QED shifts of degenerate of quasidegenerate levels are calculated, the scalar Green’s function g of Eq. (1) is

simply replaced by a ﬁnite-size matrix deﬁned on the space of levels under consideration [29].

GRAPHICAL CALCULATIONS

Obviously, analytic properties of the Green’s function [27] are important in the evaluation of Eq. (1). We have
developed a set of graphical techniques that allow one to obtain the Laurent series of the Green’s function GN (E) by
a systematic procedure. The idea behind these techniques consists in displaying the analytic structure of the Green’s
function step by step; each step explicitly extracts one singularity, and we proceed until we have exhausted all the
singularities of the Green’s function; at this point, contour integrals such as Eq. (1) can be calculated quite simply.

It is impossible to give here a full account of the method we use for deriving the eﬀective, ﬁnite-size QED Hamilto-
nian. However, we can mention a particular feature of our calculational strategy: a very special “particle” appears in
our algorithm; this particle is quite simple since it “disintegrates” immediately (zero life time) and cannot move (zero
probability for going from one position to a diﬀerent one). In mathematical terms, the coordinate-space propagator
of this particle is a four-dimensional Delta function δ(4)[(~x, t); (~x′, t′)] that we represent by a special line in Feynman
diagrams.

THE SCREENED SELF-ENERGY

The experimental accuracy on transition energies is so high that second-order (i.e., two-photon) eﬀects must be taken
into account in order to compare experiments with theory. We thus have very recently calculated the contribution of

the self-energy screening [30] to the QED eﬀective hamiltonian; this contribution corresponds to the following physical
processes:

Our result is part of the current theoretical eﬀort developed with the aim of matching experimental precisions.

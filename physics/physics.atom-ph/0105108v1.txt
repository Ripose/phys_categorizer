Ground state ionization potential of the He4 atom is eval-
uated to be 5 945 204 221 (42) MHz. Along with lower order
contributions, this result includes all eﬀects of the relative
orders α4, α3me/mα and α5 ln2 α.

In contrast to the theoretical description of electro-
magnetically bound two-body systems like hydrogen,
positronium or muonium, where considerable progress is
achieved (for the recent reviews see, e.g., [1]), high preci-
sion calculations in more complex atoms are elaborated
to a lesser degree. The central problem with an exten-
sion of the methods developed for the two-body problem
to few-electron atoms is that those methods are usually
strongly rely on the solution of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for a single particle in the Coulomb ﬁeld. Having
a simple analytic form, this solution is a perfect refer-
ence point for the calculation of various observables as
power series in the ﬁne structure constant α using the
quantum-mechanical perturbation theory. In higher or-
ders of this perturbation theory, where the nonrelativistic
approximation usually breaks down, the explicit form of
the nonrelativistic solution facilitates the extraction of
the ultraviolet divergences. These divergences are can-
celed by matching to their ﬁnite counterparts calculated
in the fully relativistic framework of the quantum elec-
trodynamics.

Although the Schr¨odinger equation for, e.g., three par-
ticles bound by the Coulomb potentials can be solved
numerically with very high accuracy [2], the lack of an
analytic solution makes the problem of the divergences
cancellation more involved as compared to the two-body
case. This problem was recently analyzed in Ref. [3] using
singlet states of the helium atom as an example. Employ-
ing the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics [4] reg-
ularized dimensionally, it is demonstrated in [3] how all
the divergences arising in the quantum-mechanical per-
turbation theory can be extracted and canceled at the
operator level, without recourse to an explicit form of
(α4)
the helium wave function. For the ﬁrst time the
correction to singlet S levels of the He4 atom is repre-
sented as a sum of apparently ﬁnite average values of the

regularization-independent operators.

In this Letter we present the most precise evaluation
of the helium ground state energy. Expressed in terms of
the ionization potential (the diﬀerence between ground
state energies of the singly charged ion and of the atom),
our result reads:

νth(11S) = 5 945 204 221 (42) MHz.

In the remaining part of this Letter we brieﬂy describe
details of our calculation. Ground state energy of the
helium atom is calculated as power series in the ﬁne
1) contribution2, the
structure constant α. Leading (
Schr¨odinger energy E, and the corresponding wave func-
tion ψ are found as a solution of the variational problem

∼

1The uncertainty in (3) exceeds that in (1) because only part
of the O(α4) corrections has been included into the calculation
that lead to Eq.(3).
2Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we use the atomic units e = ¯h =
me = 1 and c = 1/α throughout this paper. In particular,
the unit of energy is 2Ry ≡ mec2α2.

Variational expansion in the basis (6) was shown in [2]
to be very eﬀective. It yields the best available nonrela-
tivistic energies for many atomic and molecular systems
and in particular for the ground state of the helium atom.
Simplicity of the basis (6) allows us to evaluate analyt-
ically matrix elements of all the operators that appear
in the calculation. By a proper diﬀerentiation and/or
integration of the basic integral,

constants are included into the ﬁnal result for the ion-
ization potential (see Table). High accuracy of (9) is not
redundant since the calculation of rather singular matrix
elements of higher order corrections requires very accu-
rate variational wave function.

presentation, we explicitly take into consideration that
the spin of the nucleus and the total spin of electrons are
both equal to zero. In particular, we replace the product
of the electron spin operators s1s2 by its eigenvalue in

A new way of deﬁning unstable states

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

We present a new way of deﬁning unstable states, which describe unstable particles or excited
atoms. We show that an unstable state can be deﬁned by taking the complex pole of Green’s
function depending on the test functions.
In this way the long-standing problem of exponential
catastrophe is removed. The particle component of this new unstable state shows exact exponential
decay for t > 0. The ﬁeld component shows a travelling ﬁeld with complex frequency inside the
light cone and a dressing cloud.

PACS numbers: 02.70.Hm, 03.65.Ca, 11.10.St, 23.60.+e

The problem of deﬁning unstable particles has a long
and controversial history. Although unstable particles
abound in nature, the conventional quantum mechanics
allows only states with real eigenvalues, which describe
only stable particles or states. Thus the question arises
whether we can construct a state which represents an
unstable particle.

A number of people tried to solve this problem.
Gamow ﬁrst introduced complex frequencies to model
unstable particles with exponential decay [1]. Nakanishi
[2] introduced complex distributions to deﬁne a complex
eigenstate of the Hamiltonian in Lee’s model [3]. The real
part of the eigenvalue gave the particle’s mass, and the
imaginary part gave the lifetime. Sudarshan, Chiu and
Gorini [4] constructed complex eigenstates using contour
deformation in the complex plane. Bohm and Gadella
[5] constructed complex eigenvectors using poles of the S
matrix and Hardy class test functions (see also [6]). Pri-
gogine and collaborators studied extensively the proper-
ties of complex spectral representation in the Friedrichs
model [7], and deﬁned unstable states in the Liouville
space (see [8] and references therein). Still, the exponen-
tial growth of the ﬁeld component outside the light cone
(also called the exponential catastrophe) remained as a
problem [9, 10].

In this Letter we show that an unstable state without
exponential catastrophe can be constructed by analytic
continuation that depends on the test functions. The
particle component of this unstable state follows exact
exponential decay law for t > 0, and the ﬁeld component
includes travelling waves with complex frequency exactly
inside the light cone.

We consider the Friedrichs model in one dimension [11,
12]. This is a model of a two-level atom interacting with
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the dipole and rotating wave
approximations [13]. It is also a simpliﬁed version of the
Lee model of unstable particle in the one-particle sector
[3]. The Hamiltonian is given by

Hereafter the summation is understood in the sense of

has the complex poles at ω = z1 or ω = z∗

This solution contains only ﬁeld modes. The bare un-
stable particle is viewed as a superposition of the ﬁeld
modes. The diﬃculty is that in this view the unstable
particle has the memory of its creation. The decay law
is not strictly exponential, so we can distinguish old par-
ticles and young particles. We want a deﬁnition of un-
stable states describing indistinguishable particles. This
requires strict exponential decay [14].

For this goal, we start with the complex spectral rep-
resentation of the Hamiltonian [7] (we separate the pole
z1 from the ‘

in Eq. (5).)

Due to the completeness relation (21) the exponential
growth of the complex eigenvector for t < 0 or outside
the light cone is cancelled by the ﬁeld components [15].
However, we want to ﬁnd an unstable state that is, by
itself, free from the exponential catastrophe.

We note that if we had included virtual transitions in the
Hamiltonian, the background contribution would also be
strictly conﬁned within the light cone [16].

In this paper we have limited our discussion to Dirac
bras or kets. An extension to density operators in the
Liouville space involves products of distributions, which
could be considered elsewhere.

We summarize the unique properties of our new unsta-
ble state. It has test function dependence, but does not
have strict restrictions on the test functions. The test
function space of this state is larger than the Hardy-class
function space used in Refs. [5, 6], only requiring mero-
morphic functions with no singularity at z1. Even if the
test function is not analytic in the real axis, we can still
apply the condition (25) if the test function can be ap-
proximated by a sum of meromorphic functions with no
singularity at z1. Examples are Fourier series or Fourier
integrals. By our ‘test-function dependent’ analytic con-
tinuation the particle component of the unstable state
decays with semigroup time evolution (see Eq. (34))

1 Introduction

Pionic hydrogen atoms are unique systems to study the strong interaction at low
energies 2). The inﬂuence of the strong interaction in pionic hydrogen can be

extracted from the (np
interaction, the 1s level is aﬀected by an energy shift ǫ1s and a line broadening
Γ1s. The shift and the broadening are related to the hadronic scattering lengths

where ǫ1s is the strong interaction shift of the 1s level reﬂecting the π p scat-

is the branching ratio of the charge exchange and radiative capture (Panofsky

lengths to the measurable shift and width 7, 8, 9). The hadronic scattering
lengths can be related to the isospin-even and isospin-odd scattering length,

The isospin scattering lengths can ben related to ǫ1s and Γ1s in the frame-
work of the Heavy Barion Chiral Perturbation Theory (χPT) 5). Scattering
experiments are restricted to energies above 10 MeV and have to rely on an
extrapolation to zero energy to extract the scattering lengths. Pionic hydrogen
spectroscopy permits to measure this scattering length at almost zero energy
(in the same order as the binding energies, i.e., some keV) and verify with high
accuracy the χPT calculations. Moreover, the measurement of Γ1s allows an
evaluation of the pion-nucleon coupling constant fπN , which is related to a−
by the Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme sum rule (GMO) 6).

Pionic atom spectroscopy permits to measure another important quan-
tity: the charged pion mass. Orbital energies of pionic atoms depend on the
reduced mass of the system. These energies can be calculated with high ac-
curacy using Quantum Electrodynamics. Measuring transition energies, not
disturbed by strong interaction, allows to determine the reduced mass of the
system and hence the mass of the pion. The accurate value of the pion mass is
crucial to evaluate the upper bound of the mass of the muonic neutrino from
a measurement of the pion decay 11).

2 Description of the setup

The pionic atoms are produced using the pion beam provided by the Paul
Scherrer Institut 1). The beam momentum is 110 MeV/c with an intensity of
108 s−1. The pions are captured and slowed down using a cyclotron trap 12).
The target is made of a cylindrical cell with Kapton walls, positioned in the
center of the trap. In the target cell the decelerated pions are captured in bound
atomic states. During the de-excitation X-rays are emitted. As the muons from
the pion decay in the beam are present as well, it is possible to produce muonic
atoms and pionic atoms at the same time. The X-ray transition energies are
measured using a bent crystal spectrometer and a position sensitive detector.
The reﬂection angle ΘB between the crystal planes and the X-rays is related
to the photon wavelength λ = hc/E by the Bragg formula:

n λ = 2 d sin ΘB

(4)

where n is the order of the reﬂection and d is the spacing of the crystal planes.
The detector is formed by an array of 6 CCDs composed each by 600
600
pixels 11), the pixel size is 40 µm. The 3-4 keV X-rays excite mostly one or
two pixels. Larger clusters are due to charged particle or high-energy gamma
radiation and can be eliminated by cluster analysis. Transitions of diﬀerent
energies result in diﬀerent reﬂection lines on the detector. By measuring the
distance between these lines it is possible to determine the energy diﬀerence.
The resolution of the spectrometer is of the order of 0.4 eV at 3 keV.

3 Extraction of the hadronic shift and width

→

The characteristics of the ground state of pionic hydrogen are evaluated mea-
suring the X-ray transitions np
1s (see ﬁg.1). The line width is the result
of the convolution of: the spectrometer resolution, the Doppler broadening ef-
fect from the non-zero atom velocity, the natural width of the ground state,
and, of course, the hadronic broadening. A very accurate measurement of the
1s2 1S0
response function of the crystal was performed using the 1s2s 3S1 →
M1 transitions in He-like argon (with a natural line width less than 1 meV,
Doppler broadening about 40 meV). For this measurement the cyclotron trap
was converted into an Electron-Resonance Ion Trap (ECRIT) 13), with the
crucial point that the geometry of the setup was preserved.
The Doppler broadening eﬀect in the pionic transitions can be studied by work-
ing at diﬀerent pressures and with diﬀerent transitions. With the help of a
cascade model we can predict the kinetic energy distribution of the atoms and
the corresponding Doppler broadening 14).
A ﬁrst series of measurements were completed in 2002. The hadronic broaden-
ing Γ1s extracted from the experimental line width is:

By varying the target density, we were able to prove that the formation
[(πpp)p]ee 15), which can add an additional

shift to the ground state, is negligible. Energy calibration for the πH(3p
→
1s) transition is performed using the 6h
5g transition in pionic oxygen.
Strong interaction and ﬁnite nucleus size eﬀect are negligible for this transition.
Orbital energies can be calculated with an accuracy of a few meV 16). The
result for the shift is:

→

0.017 eV

ǫ1s = 7.120
For the calculation of the shift a pure QED value of EQED

3p−1s = 2878.809 eV
was used. The above given errors include statistical accuracy and systematic
eﬀects 17). The value of ǫ1s is in agreement with the result of a previous
experiment, where the energy calibration was performed with Kα ﬂuorescence
X-rays 18), but more precise by a factor of 3.

4 Pion mass measurement

The evaluation of the pion mass is obtained by the measurement of the transi-
tion energy of the 5g
4f transition in pionic nitrogen in 2000 (see ﬁg.1). We
used the analog transition in muonic oxygen as a reference line. The energy
diﬀerence between the two lines depends on the ratio between the pion mass

and the muon mass, which is known with 0.05 ppm accuracy. The expected
accuracy for the pion mass is less than 2 ppm, to be compared with the ac-
tual value, which has an accuracy of 2.5 ppm. This value is the average of
two measurements, obtained using two diﬀerent techniques and which diﬀer by
5.4 ppm 19). To reach this precision, we need a perfect understanding of the
crystal spectrometer aberrations and the exact distance between pixels in the
detector. For the second task an experiment was set up in September 2003 to
100◦C. We used
measure the pixel distance at the working temperature of
a nanometric grid composed by 21
14 lines, 20 µm thick, spaced by 2 mm
with an accuracy of about 0.05 µm. The mask, at room temperature, was
illuminated by a point-like source at a distance of 6426.7 mm, and positioned
at 37 mm from the CCD detector (see ﬁg.2). Applying linear ﬁts to the lines of
the grid in the CCD image it was possible to provide an accurate measurement
of the average pixel distance:

5 Conclusions and outlook

The strong interaction shift in pionic hydrogen has been determined with an
accuracy of 0.2%. During spring-summer 2004 the crystals have been char-
acterized with X-rays from the ECRIT. The measurement of the broadening

in muonic hydrogen in November-December 2004, together with the cascade
model, will allow us to reach an accuracy of 1% for Γ1s.

We thank the PSI staﬀ, in particular the nanotechnology group, which provided
the nanometric mask for the pixel measurement.

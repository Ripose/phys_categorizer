It has been recently reported [15] that kicked rotators with certain non-analytic potentials avoid
dynamical localization and undergo a metal-insulator transition. We show that typical properties
of this transition are still present as the non-analyticity is progressively smoothed out provided
that the smoothing is less than a certain limiting value. We have identiﬁed a smoothing dependent
time scale such that full dynamical localization is absent and the quantum momentum distribution
develops power-law tails with anomalous decay exponents as in the case of a conductor at the metal-
insulator transition. We discuss under what conditions these ﬁndings may be veriﬁed experimentally
by using ultra cold atoms techniques. It is found that ultra-cold atoms can indeed be utilized for
the experimental investigation of the metal-insulator transition.

The study of a quantum particle in a random poten-
tial [1] is one of the cornerstones of modern condensed
matter physics. In its simplest form, namely, a free spin-
less particle in a short-range disordered potential with
no interactions at zero temperature, the combination of
the one parameter scaling theory [2], the supersymmetry
method [3] and numerical simulations [4] has led to the
following picture: In two and lower dimensions destruc-
tive interference caused by backscattering produces expo-
nential localization of the eigenstates in real space for any
amount of disorder. As a consequence, quantum trans-
port is suppressed, the spectrum is uncorrelated (Pois-
son) and the system becomes an insulator. In more than
two dimensions there exists a metal insulator transition
(usually referred to as Anderson transition (AT))for a
critical amount of disorder. By critical disorder we mean
a disorder such that, if increased, all the eigenstates be-
come exponentially localized. For a disorder strength be-
low the critical one, the system has a mobility edge at a
certain energy which separates localized from delocalized
states. Its position moves away from the band center as
the disorder is decreased. Delocalized eigenstates, typical
of a metal, are extended through the sample and the level
statistics agree with the random matrix prediction for the
appropriate symmetry. In three and higher dimensions
the AT takes place in a region of strong disorder only ac-
cessible to numerical [4, 5] simulations. Typical features
of the AT include:

1. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian is scale invari-
ant [6], namely, any spectral correlator utilized to de-
scribe the spectral properties of the disordered Hamil-
tonian does not depend on the system size. The spec-
tral correlations at the AT, usually referred to as critical
statistics [6, 7], are intermediate between that of a metal
and that of an insulator.

2. Anomalous scaling of the eigenfunction moments,
1) with respect to the sam-
Pq =
−
ple size L, where Dq is a set of exponents describing the
AT. Eigenfunctions with such a nontrivial (multi) scaling
are usually dubbed multifractals [5] (for a review see [8]).
3. Quantum diﬀusion is anomalous [9] at the AT. In
the metallic limit, up to small weak localization correc-
tions, the density of probability is Gaussian-like and the
dynamics is well described by a Brownian motion. How-
ever, as disorder increases, localization eﬀects become
important and quantum diﬀusion slows down. The den-
sity of probability develops power-law tails with a decay
exponent depending on the spectrum of multifractal di-
mensions [9].

Unfortunately the experimental veriﬁcation of the AT
is a challenging task.
In the context of electronic sys-
tems is extremely hard to disentangle eﬀects caused by
short decoherence times, electron-electron interactions
and phonon-electron interactions from destructive quan-
tum interference and symmetry, supposed to be the main
ingredients driving the AT.

In recent years ultracold atoms in optical lattices [10]
has been utilized to model certain solid state physics sys-
tems. Generically, in these experiments a very dilute
almost free gas of atoms (Cs and Rb) is cooled up to
temperatures of the order of tens µK and then inter-
In its simplest form, the

optical lattice consists of two laser beams prepared in
such a way that the resulting interference pattern is a
stationary plane wave in space. The laser frequency is
tuned close to a resonance of the atomic system in or-
der to enhance the atom-laser coupling but not too close
to avoid spontaneous emission. In this limit the system
laser-atom can be considered as a point particle in a sine
potential, namely, the quantum pendulum. Additionally

if the laser is turned on only in a series of short periodic
pulses the resulting system is very well approximated by
the so called quantum kicked rotor (see [11] for a review)
extensively studied in the context of quantum chaos,

The classical motion of this system is diﬀusive in momen-
tum space. For short time scales, quantum and classical
motion agrees. However quantum diﬀusion is eventually
suppressed due to interference eﬀects and eigenstates are
exponentially localized in momentum space. This coun-
terintuitive feature, usually referred to as dynamical lo-
calization [12], was fully understood [13] after mapping
the kicked rotator problem onto an short range 1D disor-
dered system where localization is well established. The
ﬁrst direct experimental realization of the kicked rotor
was reported in Ref.
[10]. As was expected, the output
of the experiment (the distribution of the atom momen-
tum and the energy diﬀusion as a function of time) fully
agrees with the theoretical prediction of dynamical local-
ization [13]. Finally we remark that, after the pioneering
work of Ref.[10], many other aspects of the physics of
a quantum kicked rotor as the eﬀect of noise and dissi-
pation have also been investigated [14] by using similar
experimental settings.

The above results do not depend on the exact details of
the potential but only on its ability to produce classical
chaotic motion. The situation is diﬀerent if the potential
is not smooth. Recently [15] it has been reported that
a kicked rotor could avoid full dynamical localization if
the smooth sinusoidal optical potential is replaced with
a generic potential with a logarithmic or step like singu-
larity. It was found that, for these potentials, the kicked
particle has striking similarities with a free particle in a
disordered potential at the AT. Thus level statistics are
given by critical statistics, eigenfunctions are multifractal
and quantum diﬀusion becomes anomalous.

A natural question to ask is whether this non-
analytical kicked rotor can be realized in experiments.
If so, this would be an ideal setting to test the physics
of the AT. Obviously, in experiments the singularity can
only be approximated. For instance, an optical lattice
potential with an approximate step-like singularity can
be produced [17] either by a holographic mask [18] with
precision σ or by adding a limited number of Fourier com-
ponents. In both cases the potential is smooth on suﬃ-
ciently small scales
σ. That means that for momenta
¯h/σ and times td suﬃciently long, the microscopic
pd ≫
smoothness of the potential is at work and standard dy-
namical localization should be observed. On the other
hand, for momenta pc and times tc suﬃciently short,
classical and quantum results should coincide.
In be-
tween these two scales typical properties of the AT are
observed. The aim of this paper is twofold on the one
hand we seek to determine in what window of σ the AT
is observed. On the other hand we examine whether this
range is already experimentally accessible by using ultra

cold atoms in optical lattices.

The organization of the paper is as follows:

In the
next section we introduce a kicked rotor with two dif-
ferent smoothed out versions of a step potential. Then
we evaluate the rate of energy diﬀusion and the full mo-
mentum distribution. Finally we establish the minimum
smoothing required to observe the AT and whether an ex-
perimental veriﬁcation is realistic with the current, state
of the art, ultra cold atom techniques.

gated in [15]. Obviously there are inﬁnitely many ways
to smooth a singularity, we have chosen the above two
due to similarities with the experimental situation. Thus
V1(q) represents an optical lattice with square-wave in-
tensity proﬁle as produced by an array of ﬁne slits or a
holographic mask [18]. The other potential V2(q) pro-
duces an approximated step-like shape by adding a lim-
ited number of Fourier components. We remark that re-
sults for V1(q) and V2(q) are hardly distinguishable, both
are smooth and oscillatory on scales of the order of σ.
Numerically it is a little easier to simulate V1(q) so we
will stick to it for the numerical calculations.

We analyze both the classical and the quantum motion
of the above Hamiltonian. The classical evolution over
∂V (qn)
a period T is dictated by the map: pn+1 = pn −
,
∂qn
qn+1 = qn + T pn+1 (mod 2π). By smoothing the step
potential the classical force has a well deﬁned classical
limit for any ﬁnite σ.

The quantum dynamics is governed by the quantum
over a period T . Thus, after a pe-

Such degree of precision is a necessary requirement to de-
termine the eﬀect of a small σ in the quantum transport
properties of the model studied.

Analytical results for the above model can in princi-
ple be obtained by mapping Eq.(2) onto an 1D Anderson
model. This method was introduced in [13] for the case
of a kicked rotor with a smooth potential. We do not re-
peat here the details of the calculation but just state how
the 1D Anderson model is modiﬁed by the non-analytical
potential. It turns out that the classical non-analyticity
induces long-range disorder in the associated 1D Ander-
son model. If the kick strength is suﬃciently large the di-
agonal part of the Anderson model is pseudo-random and
1/r with r the dis-
the oﬀ-diagonal one decays as Ur ∼
tance from the diagonal. This Anderson model is similar
to the one studied in [5] which is solved by using the su-
persymmetry method. In general, according to Ref.[5], a
1/r decay in 1D is a signature of an AT. For the potential
1/r for
V1,2 above, it is straightforward to show that Ur ∼
σr for r > 1/σ. Consequently we

expect to observe AT like behavior for small momentum
and then eventually recover the results of the sinusoidal

We recall our aim is to ﬁnd out whether the transport
properties are compatibles with those of a disordered con-
ductor at the AT and how they are aﬀected by the short
distance diﬀerentiability of the potential. For the sake
of completeness let us brieﬂy summarize the predictions
for both a kicked particle in a smooth potential and a
disordered conductor at the AT.

For a kicked rotator with a smooth potential, it is well
established that initially (up to a certain time tc) both
classical and quantum probabilities are Gaussian like and
the diﬀusion in momentum is normal, namely, a standard
Brownian motion. For longer times the classical density
of probability is still that of a normal diﬀusion process.
However Pq(p, t) become exponentially localized and en-
ergy diﬀusion stops
cons. These are typical
signatures of dynamical localization.

p2(t)

i ∼

At the AT, up to a certain tc, agreement is also ex-
pected between the classical and quantum predictions. In
the case of a disordered conductor the classical dynamics
is obviously well described by a Brownian motion. How-
ever, for t > tc, the diﬀusion becomes anomalous, the
quantum density of probability develop power-law tails
in space (localization in a disordered conductor occurs
in real space) and time with exponents related to the
multifractal dimensions of the eigenstates [9]. The rate
of diﬀusion is in some cases still similar to the one cor-
responding to normal diﬀusion
= Dquant though
the quantum diﬀusion constant Dquan is typically lower.
This suggests that, at the AT, destructive interference
is still at work but it is not suﬃcient to fully localize
the particle. In our case we also expect agreement be-
tween classical and quantum results up to a certain time
tc(σ). Additionally, since the potential is diﬀerentiable
for distances smaller than the smoothing σ, we expect
that there exists a td(σ) such that for t
td standard
dynamical localization becomes dominant.

goes beyond a few kicks. By contrast, the time scale
signaling the beginning of full dynamical localization, due
to the diﬀerentiability of the potential, increases as σ
decreases, td ≈

accessible to experimental veriﬁcation. By using holo-
graphic mask techniques one can reach up to σ

[17]. On the other hand coherence in ultra cold atoms is
maintained well beyond 1000 kicks. Consequently the AT
can be investigated by using ultracold atoms in optical

Our ﬁrst task is to determine tc and td as a function
of σ. These time scales can in principle be calculated by
using diﬀerent observables. Qualitatively all observables
should provide the same physical picture. However the
numerical value of tc and td may depend on the observ-

As was mentioned previously we used as initial condi-

conditions in the narrow region [

kick. Thus even after several kicks there is a high proba-
bility that the system stays in the region p = 0. In order
to show that our results are not sensitive to initial con-
ditions and stable under perturbations we have added a

B. Density of probability

In the classical case we distinguish two diﬀerent
regimes separated by a broad crossover region (see den-
sity of probability in Fig.2): First, for short time scales
< c(σ)√2Dt the diﬀusion is anoma-
(a few kicks) and
lous. P (p, t)

increases as σ is decreased. For such a short time scale
the classical system does not feel the diﬀerentiability of
the potential.

For longer times but t < td, we observe a gradual
crossover from anomalous to normal diﬀusion. For small
momentum the density is still non Gaussian as the eﬀect
of the pseudo non diﬀerentiability is still important. As
time approaches td, the central (small momentum) non-
Gaussian region becomes smaller and smaller. Mean-
while, the outskirts bend down and a Gaussian-like be-
havior typical of normal diﬀusion is observed. Finally,
for t > td, P (p, t) is well approximated by a Gaussian
distribution. These regions have been observed for all σ
of interest.

In the quantum case three regimes are distinguished

(see Fig. 3):

typical features of an AT in the transport properties of
our system, tc and td must be well separated, namely,

C. Experimental veriﬁcation

A natural question to ask is what is the minimum val-
ues of σ that it can be reached in experiments. Speciﬁ-
cally, we wish to determine, for instance, the maximum
number of terms in V1(q) that can be included experimen-
tally. In principle [17] it is an challenging experimental
task to realize optical potentials with high slopes involv-
ing higher optical harmonics of the laser beam. The prob-
lem is that, for instance for Cs, the fourth harmonic is
already in the vacuum UV, and diﬃcult to produce. Ad-
ditionally higher order harmonics are not resonant with
the atom and need a much stronger intensity. Thus it
seems extremely hard to go beyond the ﬁrst few harmon-
ics. Another option could be to use a kicked rotor with
a smooth potential and three incommensurate frequen-
cies. According to the results of [21], this model can be
mapped it onto a 3D Anderson model which is supposed
to undergo an AT for a speciﬁc value of the coupling con-
stant. However in more than one dimension there is no
clear evidence that this mapping is really accurate. For
instance, the critical exponents at the AT are very dif-
ferent from the one found in the kicked rotor with three
incommensurate frequencies [22].

A more promising alternative is to use a holographic
mask to give a square-wave intensity proﬁle [18]. This
technique combined with the recent introduction of spa-
tial light modulators permit the production of a very
broad range of intensity pattern which act as a eﬀective
spatial potential for atoms. Unlike the previous method
the sharpness of the edges would be limited by diﬀraction
eﬀects of the order of the wavelength [17]. With the cur-
rent techniques the potential of Eq.3 could be produced
2. On the other hand quantum co-
in a window σ
herence in cold atoms is lost after a few thousands kicks.
The experimental bounds are thus within (see above) the
theoretical limits and, as a consequence, the AT can be
studied by using ultra cold atoms in optical lattices.

10−

≥

In conclusion, we have explicitly shown that kick ro-
tors with a singular but slightly smoothed potential still
have similar transport properties that those of a disor-
dered conductor at the AT provided that the degree of
smoothing is weak enough. The utilization of ultra cold
atoms in optical lattices oﬀers the opportunity to inves-

tigate Anderson localization in general and the AT in
particular in a setting free from many of the inconve-
niences that have plagued other experimental studies of
the AT in the context of condensed matter physics.

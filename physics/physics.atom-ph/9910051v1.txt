Abstract

In the presence of an intensive laser ﬁeld the radiative recombination of the
continuum electron into an atomic bound state generally is accompanied by
absorption or emission of several laser quanta. The spectrum of emitted pho-
tons represents an equidistant pattern with the spacing equal to the laser
frequency. The distribution of intensities in this spectrum is studied employ-
ing the Keldysh-type approximation, i.e. neglecting interaction of the impact
electron with the atomic core in the initial continuum state. Within the adi-
abatic approximation the scale of emitted photon frequencies is subdivided
into classically allowed and classically forbidden domains. The highest in-
tensities correspond to emission frequencies close to the edges of classically
allowed domain. The total cross section of electron recombination summed
over all emitted photon channels exhibits negligible dependence on the laser
ﬁeld intensity.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the laser plasma emits photons with frequencies which are diﬀerent
from the frequency of the incident laser beam. For a number of applications an emission
of high energy photons is the most interesting phenomenon. The known mechanisms which
can be responsible for the high energy photo-production could be identiﬁed as the following
three ones: the high harmonic generation, laser stimulated bremsstrahlung and laser assisted
recombination. These processes diﬀer by the initial and ﬁnal states of the active electron. In
the harmonic generation the initial state electron occupies a (laser-dressed) atomic bound
state, usually it is the ground atomic state. In the ﬁnal state of this reaction the electron
can occupy either the same bound state, or some excited or even ionized state. The laser
stimulated bremsstrahlung is a free-free transition during which the electron is scattered by
an atom in the laser ﬁeld. During the scattering the electron emits a high-energy quantum.
In the laser assisted recombination (LAR) the electron starts in the laser-dressed continuum,
but ends up in the bound state. The process of harmonic generation is currently studied
very actively with important advancements both in theory and experiment (for reviews see
Refs. [1,2]). The laser stimulated bremsstrahlung plays the very important role in plasma
physics, see recent experimental

[3,4] and theoretical

[5,6] works.

The subject of the present study is the LAR process. As far as we know, it has not
yet received a proper attention in the literature, although its importance for kinetics of
laser plasma and its emission spectrum was indicated before [7]. From the point of view
of the high-energy photo-production the LAR possesses an advantage over the stimulated
bremsstrahlung because in LAR the electron impact energy is totally transferred to the high
energy quanta.

The conventional (laser-ﬁeld free) radiative recombination of the continuum electron to
the bound state is a well studied process which is inverse to the photoionization. The
frequency of the emitted photon is uniquely deﬁned by the energy conservation law. When
a similar process occurs in the presence of an intensive laser ﬁeld the radiation spectrum
becomes much more richer since the recombination may be accompanied by absorption or
emission of laser quanta. Therefore the emitted photon spectrum represents a sequence of
equidistant lines separated by the laser frequency ω. The recent review by Hahn [8] on
the electron recombination mentions only one, very special version of LAR process, namely
one–photon LAR when the laser is tuned in resonance with the energy of free-bound electron
transition, and only emission of photons with this particular energy is considered. The study
of this special case was initiated quite long ago [9–13] and remains active in connection with
the processes in the storage rings [14–20], formation of positronium [9] and antihydrogen
[21–23] and even with possible cosmological manifestations [24].
In all these theoretical
studies the laser ﬁeld was presumed to be weak and its inﬂuence on an initial and/or ﬁnal
electron states was neglected, except Refs. [7,23] which are commented below.

For production of high-energy photons it is very interesting to extend the mentioned
above studies allowing for the multiphoton absorption during LAR. Obviously the multi-
photon processes can happen with high probability only in a strong laser ﬁeld. From this
point of view there arises a necessary to fulﬁll a systematic study of LAR in a strong laser
ﬁeld in multiphoton regime. This paper makes a ﬁrst step in this direction.

An additional, and rather unexpected inspiration for the present study arises from the

2

fact that LAR comprises one of the steps in the three-step quantum scheme of high harmonic
generation. This scheme has recently been ﬁrmly established, see Ref. [25] and bibliography
therein. The major statement of [25] is that the high harmonic generation can be described
as the multiphoton ionization of an atomic electron which is followed by the LAR of this
electron with the parent atomic particle. From this point of view the LAR plays a role of
’a part’ of the problem of the high harmonic generation, which is important not only for
the dense laser plasma, but also for photo-production from individual atoms in strong laser
ﬁelds, where the harmonic generation is the major source for high energy photons.

The present study is devoted mostly to the patterns of intensities in the emitted photon
spectrum depending on the laser ﬁeld strength. We comment also on the inﬂuence of laser
ﬁeld on the total recombination cross section. Here, as well as in other applications, the
laser ﬁeld is intensive and LAR proceeds in substantially multiphoton regime.

where c is the velocity of light. The cross section (1.4) refers to the process of spontaneous
LAR, since it is presumed that incident electromagnetic ﬁeld with the frequency ˜ΩM is
absent. In case if such a probe ﬁeld is present, generally it would be ampliﬁed in course of
propagation through the medium containing free electrons. There is a number of theoretical
works devoted to calculation of related gain in case of one-photon LAR. A recent paper by
Zaretskii and Nersesov [7] explores the ampliﬁcation in case of multiphoton LAR. Generally
these studies imply some assumptions regarding the medium properties and result in the

expressions for the rate of stimulated transitions via that of spontaneous transitions and
some characteristics of laser beam and the experimental arrangement [10–12,7]. The present
paper provides analysis of spontaneous LAR whereas issues of radiation ampliﬁcation are
beyond its scope.

II. KELDYSH-TYPE APPROXIMATION

We develop the Keldysh-type approximation where the interaction of the continuum
electron with the atomic core is neglected, i.e. the laser-dressed electron continuum state
Φp is approximated by the well-known Volkov state. The laser wave is assumed to be linear
polarized with the electric ﬁeld strength F(t) = F cos ωt. Explicit expression for the Volkov
functions is conveniently cast as

The ﬁnal bound state (2.6) is always available if electron collides with a positive ion. In case
of collision with a neutral atom we assume existence of a stable negative ion. By substituting
formulae (2.1)–(2.6) into (1.3) one can see that the integrand is a periodic function of time
provided the emitted photon frequency ˜ΩM satisﬁes (1.1) with integer M and εa substituted
by Ea. The lowest possible frequency of the emitted photon is ηω, where

The time integral in (2.10) can be evaluated using the saddle point method. This amounts
S(t) in (2.10) is assumed to be

to the adiabatic approximation when the phase (m + η)ωt

It shows that the photons are preferentially emitted at the moment of time when instanta-
neous continuum electron energy Ep(t) (2.4) is separated from the bound state energy Ea
by the energy of the emitted photon (m + η)ω. The LAR process is most eﬀective when this
occurs at some real moment of time, i.e. the saddle points tmµ are real-valued. This regime
corresponds to the classically allowed radiation. It can happen only for some part of the
emitted photon spectrum, i.e. only in some domain of m. Outside it, when tmµ possesses
an imaginary part, the emission is strongly suppressed. Remarkably, within the classically
allowed domain the intensity of emitted lines could vary very signiﬁcantly as detailed below.

The necessary condition of classically allowed radiation,

(3.7)

makes real the right hand side of formula (3.5). Details of classically allowed emission
depend on the relation between the electron translational momentum component pk and
the momentum F/ω acquired by the electron in its quiver motion in the laser ﬁeld. In the
fast electron regime, pk > F/ω, the term 1
2 (pk + kt)2 never passes zero as time t varies.
As a result, the saddle point equation (3.2) has two or zero real-valued solutions per ﬁeld
cycle (in the classically allowed and forbidden domains respectively, see Fig. 1a). In the
slow electron case, pk < F/ω, the 1
2(pk + kt)2 passes via zero. Due to this circumstance, as
seen from Fig. 1b, for some interval of photon frequencies Ωm the equation (3.2) has four
real-valued solutions whereas for higher Ωm only two solutions exist. Consequently, in this
case the classically allowed domain is subdivided in two parts. The related LAR regimes are
discussed below in more detail.

A. Fast electron regime: pk > F/ω

As could be anticipated, the function Ξ(m) has weak singularities at the boundaries of the
classically allowed region. The extension of the classically allowed region on the photon
frequency scale is 2pkF/ω with its center located at Ωc = 1
+ F 2/(2ω2). For
vanishing laser ﬁeld Ωc tends to the limit (1.2) and the classically allowed domain shrinks
to the single line. The condition that a single line dominates in the photon spectrum could
be formulated as 2pkF/ω2

Fig. 2 illustrates evolution of the spectrum pattern with the laser intensity I. We consider
electrons with the energy Eel = 1

frequency ω = 0.0043 and diﬀerent intensities. The electron momentum p is directed along
the laser ﬁeld strength F (p⊥ = 0). The electron recombines to the bound state of H− ion

(κ = 0.2354, Aa = 0.75 [26]). The emission amplitudes are obtained by numerical evaluation
of the time integral in (2.10). The laser ﬁeld intensities I = 1011, 1010, 109, 108, 107 W/cm2
corresponds to the values of parameter 2pF/ω2 respectively 49.4, 15.6, 4.94, 1.56, 0.494.
For the weakest ﬁeld considered (I = 107 W/cm2) the intensity of the principal line in the
spectrum (m = 14) exceeds more than 50 times these of adjacent satellites. For I = 108
W/cm2 this ratio is substantially smaller (
5). When laser ﬁeld is increased by an order
of magnitude, the dip in the emitted photon spectrum appears at m = 15. This is the
ﬁrst manifestation of the oscillatory structure in the spectrum due to interference of two
contributions in (3.4). For I = 1010 W/cm2 the structure becomes well manifested. At last,
for I = 1011 W/cm2 the structure becomes well developed and extended. In the latter case,
in fact, the situation is beyond the fast electron regime; it will be discussed in the next
subsection.

The semiclassical formula (3.4) is applicable when the classically allowed domain is suf-
ﬁciently broad on the frequency scale. Fig. 3 shows the photon spectrum in the well
manifested semiclassical regime (Eel = 10 eV, I = 1011 W/cm2, p = 0.857, F/ω = 0.392).

merical evaluation of the integral (2.10) over time (circles) oscillate violently due to the

interference eﬀects. Outside this region
eﬃcient emission occurs at the edges of the classically allowed interval. This eﬀect is com-
pletely analogous to enhancement of the probability density near the turning points for the
quantum particle moving in the potential well. The envelope function (3.9) (solid curve)
reproduces well this overall behavior. The saddle point approximation (3.4) allows us to
reproduce well the oscillatory structure (squares in Fig. 3). Within the classically-allowed
domain the summation in this formula runs over two real-valued saddle points tmµ. As m
varies approaching the domain border, two saddle points lying at the real-t axis approach
each other and eventually merge at the boundary. After that they separate again moving
perpendicular to the real axis in the complex t-plane. The latter situation corresponds
to the classically forbidden, or tunneling regime where only one saddle point is to be in-
cluded in the summation over µ in (3.5) (namely, that which ensures exponential decrease of
2 outside the classically-allowed domain). The transition between two regimes could
Cm(p)
|
be described by the Airy function. We do not pursue here the detailed description of this,
rather standard situation. In particular, Fig. 3, the results shown by squares in Fig. 3 are
obtained using the plain semiclassical formula (3.4) with two or one saddle points included
as discussed above; the deviations from the numerical results are seen to be essential only
in a very narrow transitions region. Since the numerical evaluation of integral (2.10) over
time is not diﬃcult, we employ the adiabatic approach in order to obtain better insight into
the pattern of emitted radiation spectrum, but not for producing an alternative method to
evaluate the amplitudes.

B. Slow electron regime: pk < F/ω

In this case the real-valued result for tmµ is provided by both upper and lower sign in
the expression (3.5). It is easy to see from Fig. 1b that the classically allowed region of
photon frequencies is subdivided in two domains. The ﬁrst of them, with one pair of real-
valued saddle points tmµ, corresponds to Ωm lying in the interval (3.8). At smaller photon

Of course, it is not designed for accurate description of a transition between the two-saddle-
point and four-saddle-point regimes where the deviations are seen to be larger. A special,
more sophisticated treatment is required here, but such complications are not pursued in
the present study as argued above. The non-standard situation emerges also at the left edge
of the classically allowed interval where all saddle points simultaneously move from the real
axis into the complex t plane. This transition region could not be described by a simple
Airy-type pattern that is known to give a monotonous decrease in the classically forbidden
domain; on the contrary, the numerical results reveal some structure in this region, see Fig.
4. Bearing all this in mind it is not unexpected that the plain semiclassical approximation
(3.4) essentially fails near the left border of the classically allowed domain.

≤
Cm(p)

It is worthwhile to mention also another region where the standard semiclassical approx-
imation fails. Namely, for Ω = 0 the saddle point positions coincide with the poles of the
function ˜ϕ(ǫ)
a . The situation when an exact coincidence occurs is tractable rather easily [27].
Somewhat more eﬀort is required to obtain uniform description of a transition between this
case and a situation when the saddle point and the pole are well separated, as presumed in
simple formula (3.4). Again, such sophistication are beyond the scope of the present study.
At last, Fig. 5 shows a transient situation between the fast and slow electron regimes
(Eel = 1 eV, I = 1011 W/cm2, p = 0.271, F/ω = 0.392). Here only two harmonics (m = 7, 8)
correspond to the four-saddle-point regime. The remaining part of the classically-allowed
domain, 9
56 corresponds to two-saddle-point regime. Most of the spectrum is
well described by the plain saddle-point approximation (3.4) and covered by the envelope
function (3.9), albeit the highest peak at m = 9 exceeds it, as being in the region of the
transition between the two and four-saddle point regimes. Quite paradoxically, the low-
frequency classically forbidden region with well manifested structure exhibits much higher
emission intensities as compared with the large-frequency edge of the classically allowed
domain.

IV. CONCLUSION

As discussed in the Introduction, the LAR is one of the processes responsible for emission
of high energy photons by the laser plasma. Surprisingly, it has not yet received attention
of researchers. This is particularly unsatisfactory since the other processes leading to high
energy photons (harmonic generation and laser stimulated bremsstrahlung) are currently
under active scrutiny. The present paper could be considered as a ﬁrst step to start ﬁlling

9

this gap. The theory in many aspects is parallel to the treatment of multiphoton ionization
(MPI) where the Keldysh approximation is known to provide an important insight and
quantitatively reliable results. The origin of diﬀerences between MPI and LAR lies in the
kinematics: in MPI process the allowed electron energy in the continuum are robustly deﬁned
by the parameters of the system (initial electron binding energy, laser ﬁeld frequency and
strength), whereas in the LAR the continuum electron energy is arbitrary. This rather trivial
observation results in important consequences of physical character. They are particularly
lucid in the adiabatic regime when laser frequency is suﬃciently small. The ionization is a
tunneling process for all above-threshold channels. On the contrary, in the LAR there is a
domain of photon frequencies for which emission is allowed classically.

The Keldysh-type approximation allowed us to describe evolution of the LAR spectrum
as the laser ﬁeld varies, from the single line with only weak satellites in the low-ﬁeld limit
to the broad pattern of equidistantly spaced harmonics in the strong ﬁeld case.
In the
adiabatic approximation (i.e. the saddle point method) the photon spectrum is subdivided
into classically allowed and classically forbidden domains, with the line intensities being
highest at the boundaries of the former region. Concerning the quantitative side of the
problem, the adiabatic approach is less eﬃcient for the LAR process as compared with
the treatment of above threshold ionization (ATI). The reason is that in the latter case the
saddle point method is well applicable in its most simple form, whereas for LAR process some
technical complications emerge. The diﬀerence stems from the fact that ATI process always
eﬀectively occurs at complex-valued moments of time, whereas for LAR this is generally
not the case, and several regimes could be operative with the transition regions between
them. Albeit not drastic, these complications to our opinion hardly warrant necessary
cumbersome analytical involvements, bearing in mind that the numerical calculations are
quite simple and straightforward. Nevertheless the saddle point method remains very useful
for understanding the intensity patterns in the emitted photon spectrum.

An additional assumption of the present study, that in principle could be easily aban-
doned, is the use of asymptotic expression (2.14) for the ﬁnal bound state wave function.
Again, in the LAR process the situation is less favorable for this approximation as compared
with the ATI process. This is because, as discussed in detail earlier [27], the long-range
asymptote of the bound state wave function governs ATI amplitudes, whereas LAR process
is more sensitive to the wave function behavior in the entire coordinate space.

As is pictured by Fig. 2, the amount of noticeable lines in the photon spectrum increases
with the laser ﬁeld strength, but the intensity of each individual line decreases in average.
The cross section of the electron transition into the bound state summed over all emitted
m>0 σm(p). It exhibits only very weak dependence on the
photon channels is σtot(p) =
laser ﬁled intensity I [28]. For instance, in the particular case of Fig. 2 we obtain for
10−6 for the laser ﬁeld
σtot(p) the values 3.85
·
intensities I = 1011, 1010, 109, 108, 107 W/cm2. Recent calculations [23] of the laser-assisted
antihydrogen formation in positron-antiproton collisions employed Coulomb-Volkov wave
function for the initial electron continuum state Φp and the laser-perturbed wave function
for the bound state. The authors considered only one-photon LAR process and concluded
that the LAR cross section decreases for the stronger laser ﬁelds. The present results indicate
that if the multiphoton processes are included, then the total LAR cross section is essentially
independent on laser ﬁeld intensity.

Thus the eﬀect of a laser on the recombination process looks very straightforward. The
total cross section of recombination essentially is not changed by a laser ﬁeld, but is re-
distributed over equidistant pattern in photon spectrum that becomes broader as the laser
intensity increases.

value of the photon energy Ω is passed twice during the laser ﬁeld period T if the electron is fast
(pk > F/ω).
In the slow electron regime (pk < F/ω) the classically allowed domain of Ωm is
subdivided into two regions, as seen from Fig. 1. The photons with higher Ωm are again emitted
in the double-passage mode, whereas the lower values of Ωm are passed four times per the laser
ﬁeld cycle.

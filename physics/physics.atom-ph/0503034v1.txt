We have investigated noise-induced transition of atoms between double or triple phase-space
attractors that are produced in the parametrically driven magneto-optical trap. The transition
rates between two or three dynamic attractors, measured for various modulation frequencies and
amplitudes, are in good agreement with theoretical calculations and Monte-Carlo simulations based
on the Langevin equations. Our experiment may be useful to study nonlinear dynamic problems
involving transitions between states far from equilibrium.

PACS numbers: 32.80.Pj, 05.45.-a

There have been much studies on ﬂuctuation-induced
transition between states that are in equilibrium or
far from equilibrium. For equilibrium systems, after
Kramers’ seminal work [1], many theories have been sug-
gested [2] and tested in many diﬀerent experiments: for
example, optically trapped Brownian particles [3, 4], ana-
logue circuits [5], and semiconductor lasers [6]. Recently,
there have been several experiments on far from equi-
librium systems, such as Penning trap [7], vibration-
ﬂuidized granular matter [8], and Josephson junction [9].
Theoretical works on calculation of the transition rates
[10] or the transition paths [11], and analysis of the crit-
ical exponents [12] have been performed.
In particu-
lar, interesting phenomena including oscillatory behavior
with respect to the noise intensity [13] or the phase [14],
and saddle-point avoidance [15] have been also expected.
However, except the Penning trap, the only quantita-
tively investigated experimental system was the analogue
electrical circuit [16], which can be considered as ana-
logue simulations. For the Penning trap, on the other
hand, experiment was carried out within a very narrow
parameter region: only near the bifurcation points.

In this Letter, we report on the experimental study of
the noise-induced transition in the paramterically driven
magneto-optical trap (MOT) which is a far from equi-
librium system. In particular, we have investigated the
transition in nearly full parameter regions from super-
critical bifurcation points (dynamic double attractors)
to sub-critical bifurcation points (dynamic triple attrac-
tors). For double attractors, we have measured the tran-
sition rates by observing directly the change of popu-
lation diﬀerence between two oscillating wells at vari-
ous modulation frequencies and modulation amplitudes.
On the other hand, the transition between three attrac-
tors, which has never been probed experimentally to our
knowledge, has been studied indirectly by measuring the
populations in each well [10]. We have also investigated
the transition during one period of modulation and found

no phase dependence of the transition rates [14]. All
the experimental results are found in good agreement
with theoretical calculations and Monte-Carlo simula-
tions based on the Langevin equations, which describe
well the quantum dissipation [17] including spontaneous
emission that is the origin of ﬂuctuations of atomic mo-
tion in MOT.

As reported in previous papers [18], when the intensity-
modulation frequency f of the cooling laser is around
twice the trap frequency between f1 and f2, atoms are
separated into two clouds [Fig. 1(a) Left] and oscillate in
out-of-phase motion, which corresponds to the limit-cycle
(LC) characterized by dynamic double attractors. Due
to the nonlinearity of MOT, as f is increased above f2
but below f3, there appears an additional stable attrac-
tor at the center of the LC motion, called sub-critical
bifurcation [Fig.
1(a) Right]. Given the modulation
amplitude h, the corresponding frequencies are, f1 =
h2 − h2
2f0 − (f0/2)
T , and
p
4 + h2
f3 = f0 + (hf0/2hT )
T , where f0 is the natural
trap frequency of MOT, and hT = β/(πf0) is the thresh-
old value of h for parametric resonance to occur for a
given damping coeﬃcient β.

Assuming no ﬂuctuations of atomic motion, initial con-
ditions of atomic position and velocity determine which
attractors (represented by red dots) an atom ends up
with. Figure 1(b) shows each region of two attractors
(Left) and that of three attractors (Right). For example,
if the initial condition of an atom lies in the light gray
region, the atom approaches the attractor located in the
same basin. In reality, however, there exist atomic ﬂuctu-
ating motions due to spontaneous emission, resulting in
broadened distributions of atomic position and velocity
near the stable attractors. For large diﬀusion (or sponta-
neous emissions), certain atoms may jump far from the
original attractor and be transferred to another attrac-
tor through the unstable regions near the boundary. In
this case, the shape of the atomic phase-space distribu-
tion resembles a dumbbell which has a narrow neck at
the unstable point. The distribution represents the dy-
namic potential wells, as discussed in the static potential

experiment [4].

The transition rate Wn can be characterized by the ac-
tivation law, Wn ∝ exp(−Sn/D), which is the dynamic
version of the Kramers’ equation. Here Sn is the acti-
vation energy of each state n and D is the amount of
diﬀusion which is proportional to the diﬀusion constant
of MOT. In what follows we set n = 1 and 2 for the sta-
ble states of two dynamic attractors and n = 0 for the
stationary state at the MOT center. As observed in the
stationary position-space potentials, the transition rate
increases as the diﬀusion increases or the activation en-
ergy decreases. Note that since all the nonlinear terms in
the equations of motion of MOT have the same sign as
the ﬁrst order term, the activation energy is proportional
to f and h.

Unlike the single electron in the Penning trap, there
are more than 107 atoms in the initial MOT and each
cloud of the LC motion under parametric excitation is
almost equally populated. In order to monitor the tran-
sition between two dynamic attractors, it is needed to
blow away one of the clouds because the atomic number
transferred from attractor 1 to 2 is the same as that from
2 to 1. When atoms, say in attractor 1, are removed, one
can observe some atoms in attractor 2 are transferred to
1 with time. Due to the two-way transitions the popula-
tion diﬀerence decreases exponentially. For many particle
systems the transitions can be described by the following
simple rate equations,

dN1
dt
dN2
dt

= R − γN1 − W1N1 + W2N2 ,

= R − γN2 − W2N2 + W1N1 ,

(1)

where N1 (N2) is the population of the attractor 1 (2), R
is the trap loading rate, γ is the loss rate due to collisions
by the background atoms, and W1 (W2) is the transition
rate from the attractor 1 to 2 (2 to 1). Since R and
γ are small in our experiment (as discussed later), we
neglect these terms and also assume W = W1 = W2 due
to the symmetry. Then the steady-state solution of the
population diﬀerence ∆N (= N2 − N1) is given by

∆N = ∆N0e−2W t

,

(2)

where ∆N0 is the diﬀerence with one attractor (say, n =
1 state) empty, or N1 = 0.

Our experimental setup is similar to that described
in previous work [18], but with new features: we have
used a photodiode array [19] to measure the transition
rates and used a resonant laser to blow away selectively
one atomic cloud (say, n = 1). The blowing laser was
cylindrically focused at 5 mm left from the center of the
LC motion. The intensity of the laser was over 5 times
saturation intensity and it was turned on for 3 ms in
order to remove only one atomic cloud.

Experimental results for double (triple) attractors are
obtained at the intensity of 0.034 Is (0.06 Is) and the
detuning of -2.7 Γ for the cooling laser along the longitu-
dinal z-axis, and the magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 10 G/cm,

where Is = 3.78 mW/cm2 is the averaged saturation in-
tensity and Γ = 2π× 5.9 MHz is the natural line width.
The laser intensity and detuning along the transverse
x- and y-axis are 0.63 Is and -3.0 Γ, respectively. For
these parameters, the measured trap frequency is 33.4
Hz (43.9 Hz, for triple states), and the detected damping
coeﬃcient is 45.4 s−1 (for triple states, 85.9 s−1), which
are in good agreement with the simple Doppler theory.
Note that the sub-Doppler nature of MOT is dramati-
cally suppressed and thus neglected when the transverse
laser detuning is slightly diﬀerent from that of the z-axis
laser, as discussed in depth in our previous work [19].

The typical data about the transition between dynamic

double wells are presented in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) shows
a contour plot generated by the atomic absorption sig-
nals recorded on the 16 channel photo-diode array. The
vertical axis represents the atomic position and the lon-
gitudinal axis the time evolution. In Fig. 2(a), large ab-
sorption (or large atomic number) is indicated by bright
color. From the plot one can trace the oscillating LC
attractors and measure the atomic number.
It can be
observed that one attractor is made empty at 7 half cy-
cles from the left, which is then repopulated with time,
as plotted in Fig. 2(b). Figure 2(c) presents the tem-
poral variation of the population diﬀerence (∆N ), which
clearly shows the exponential decay as expected in Eq.
(2) where the decay rate is twice the transition rate. Note
that the total number of atoms is nearly conserved dur-
ing the transitions [asterisks in Fig. 2(b)], which justiﬁes
neglect of the loading rate R and loss rate γ in Eq. (1).
In reality, the loss rate of our MOT is 0.15 s−1 which is
much smaller than the typical transition rates.

FIG. 3: Transition rates for various (a) modulation fre-
quencies and (b) modulation amplitudes, compared with the
Monte-Carlo simulations for scaled diﬀusion D.

The experimental results in Fig. 3 were obtained by
exponential ﬁtting of Fig. 2(c) for (a) various modula-
tion frequencies at h = 0.72 and (b) modulation ampli-
tudes at f /f0 = 1.89. The curves in Fig. 3 represent
the Monte-Carlo simulation results obtained from simple
Doppler equations based on two-level atom and random
spontaneous emission. We have ﬁrst calculated the tra-
jectories of atomic motion of 104 atoms initially in n = 2
state and monitored the subsequent time evolution of the
population of the two states. We have then obtained the
transition rates by ﬁtting Eq. (2). As can be observed in
Fig. 3, the experimental results are in good agreement
with the simulations when diﬀusion constant is 0.7 times
DD, where DD represents the Doppler diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient (Eq. (22) in Ref. [20]).

In the low damping regime, one can also ﬁnd that the
transition rates approximately vary around the bifurca-
tion point as

W = c1 exp h

− c2

(f − f1)2

i ,

(3)

where f1 is the modulation frequency at the bifurcation
point, and c1 and c2 are constants [10]. The constant
2/hT was obtained by direct calculation
c2 =

[10]. The constant c1 and the diﬀusion D were used as ﬁt-
ting parameters. The consequent diﬀusion D for our ex-
perimental conditions is 0.071(8), which are in the same
order to the calculated value with simple Doppler theory
DD [10]. Here the coeﬃcient A0 is
D = 3A0/
nonlinear coeﬃcient of a term z3 in the equation of mo-
tion of a parametrically-driven atom, which is presented
as Eq. (7) in Ref.
[20]. The triangles in Fig. 3(a) and
3(b) represent the ﬁtted results. Even though the calcu-
lations are mainly well applied in the limit f >∼ f1 and
β ≪ ω0, we can see these ﬁttings very well describe the
experimental results.

Since W and f are of the same order in our experi-
ment, we also have studied the time dependence of the
transition during one period of parametric oscillation.
By averaging the absorption signals over 20 times, we
have obtained the population evolution during each pe-
riod. The experiments were performed at f = 1.76f0 and
h = 0.72, with the same laser conditions and magnetic
ﬁeld gradient as above. The transition rate W was 15.4
s−1, which was measured during three oscillation periods
until the population diﬀerence became negligible. In par-
ticular, we have not found any phase dependence of the
transition rates, which indicates that transitions occur
constantly without any dependence of location of atomic
clouds in phase space. Note that these results are very
diﬀerent from those observed in periodic driven systems
[14], which were studied only theoretically. Experimental
results are also in very good agreement with simulations,
which do not show any clear variation of the transition
rates during one period.

well conditions, where f =106 Hz (= 2.42 f0) and h=0.72. (b)

points (ﬁlled box and ﬁlled circle) represent the experimen-
tal results and curves the simulations. Filled triangles show
the experimental ratios of N1 + N2 to N0 and curves the
simulation results.

For the case of dynamic triple attractors, direct obser-
vation of the transition is diﬃcult in our setup. When
f2 < f < f3, it is numerically observed that transition
occurs only between one of the two dynamic states (1
or 2) and the stable state (0), with no direct transitions
from 1 (2) to 2 (1). Moreover, unlike the double wells,

4

the transition rates Wi0 from state i to 0 are not nec-
essarily the same as W0i from state 0 to i (i = 1, 2).
Thus the method of just removing the state 1 and mon-
itoring the time evolution of the population diﬀerence
does not provide the necessary information of the rel-
evant transition rates. Therefore we have studied the
transition in the sub-critical region by using an indirect
method of measuring the populations in each state. The
ratios of the population N1 (or N2) to N0 can be used
to obtain the transition rates, that is, N1/N0 = N2/N0
=W0/2W , where we have employed W10 = W20 = W
and W01 = W02 = W0/2. Note that for a larger modula-
tion frequency, N0 becomes larger than N1 (or N2) [10],
which is conﬁrmed in our experiment.

The experimental and simulation results for dynamic
triple attractors are presented in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a)
shows the motions of atomic clouds during single pe-
riod of oscillation, which provides the population in each
state. States 1 and 2 show out-of-phase oscillating mo-
tions, while state 0 stays at the center. Our simulations
[Fig. 4(b)] have very similar results to the absorption im-
age [Fig. 4(a)], with diﬀerent spatial resolutions (1 mm
for Fig. 4(a) and 0.1 mm for Fig. 4(b)).

The data of (N1 + N2)/NT (ﬁlled boxes) and N0/NT
(ﬁlled circles) in Fig. 4(c) are obtained by ﬁtting the
proﬁles of Fig. 4(a) at 0.58 π phase. The dashed curves
((N1 + N2)/NT ) and dotted curves (N0/NT ) are derived
from Fig. 4(b) at 0.5 π. Here Nn (n = 0,1,2) is the pop-
ulation of the state n and NT =N0+N1+N2. The proﬁle
shows three peaks, representing three states, are ﬁtted by

triple Gaussian functions. Filled triangles (experiment)
and solid curves (simulation) are just the ratios of N1 +
N2 to N0, which also provides the ratio of the transitions
rates (W0/W ). One can observe N0 is increased as f
increases, whereas N1 and N2 are decreased.
It shows
that the transition from state 1 (2) to state 0 becomes
easier than that from 0 to 1 (2) as f increases. These re-
sults are in good agreement with theoretical calculation
W0/W = exp[(S1 − S0)/D] where Sn is the activation
energy of state n [10].

The parametrically driven MOT is an ideal experimen-
tal realization of dynamic double and triple attractors
under the conditions far from equilibrium. We have in-
vestigated the noise-induced transition at various f and h
from the super-critical to sub-critical bifurcation region.
The results are well described by the Monte-Carlo simu-
lations based on the Langevin equations and the simple
Doppler theory. Note that our system may be important
and useful to study nonlinear problems associated with
transitions in far from equilibrium systems. One may
also extend our system to the study of transitions be-
tween dynamic states due to non-symmetric oscillations
that occur in more nonlinear situations [21].

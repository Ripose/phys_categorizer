Abstrat

This is a sequel to an earlier artile on the theory of angular orrelation for

double photoionization. Here we onsider the two-step double photoionization of a

rare gas atom under the in(cid:29)uene of a polarized photon beam desribed by appro-

priate Stokes parameters. Cylindrial mirror analysers (CMA) are used to detet

the outgoing eletrons. Theoretial values of the orrelation funtion is obtained for

linearly polarized light and two di(cid:27)erent situations is handled. One, the value of

the orrelation funtion is obtained keeping the photo-eletron in a (cid:28)xed diretion

and in the other ase the diretion of the Auger eletron is kept (cid:28)xed. Comparison

with experiments on xenon shows exellent agreement for the ase of 4d5/2 pho-
toionization followed by a subsequent N5 −
1S0 Auger deay for a polarized
inident photon of energy 94.5eV [J. Phys.B, 26, 1141 (1993)℄.

Introdution

In an earlier paper [1℄ we onsidered the double photoionization (DPI) of a rare gas atom

under the in(cid:29)uene of unpolarized photons. The atom was taken to be in a randomly

oriented

1S0 state. We onsidered the angular orrelation between the two suessively

emitted eletrons, their emissions being adequately separated in time [2℄. Using a statis-

tial theory we obtained good agreement with the experimental results of K¨ammerling

and Shmidt [3℄.

In this paper we take the inident photon beam to be polarized. The rare gas atoms

reeiving the photon beam no longer remain randomly oriented, but beome aligned. If

a photon of adequate energy is absorbed by an atom, a photo-eletron is emitted from

one of its inner shells, leaving the atom singly ionized. This ion subsequently de-exites

by emitting an Auger eletron [4℄ from one of its outer shells. We are left with a doubly

ionized atom and two eletrons in the ontinuum.The double photoionization proess

desribed above therefore amounts to

++ + e−1 + e−2 .

As in referene [1℄ we denote the initial state (photon+atom) by the set of quantum

numbers (JaMaαa), or by virtual quantum numbers (J ′aM ′aα′a), keeping in mind possible
interation with other atoms and eletrons. (Ja, Ma) or (J ′aM ′a) are angular momentum
quantum numbers, and αa ,α′a stand for the set of remaining quantum numbers. Similarly

for the intermediate and (cid:28)nal states. The polarization properties of the photon beam are

desribed by appropriate Stokes parameters S1, S2 and S3 [5℄.

2 DPI by polarized photons :

We proeed by alulating the density matrix [6℄ and the angular orrelation funtion,

whih is the expetation value of the e(cid:30)ieny operator for the detetion of eletrons.

The density matrix of the initial state equals the produt of the density matrix of the

intermediate singly ionized atom and the density matrix of the photo-eletron. Similarly,

the density matrix of the singly ionized atom an be written as the produt of the density

matries of the doubly ionized atom and the Auger eletron.

Using the Wigner-Ekart theorem the matrix element of the density operator for the

initial atomi state an be expressed as [1℄

2.1 Attenuation orresponding to polarization sensitivity of a de-

tetor

The eletron detetor may or may not be sensitive to the spin state of the inoming

eletron. The attenuation of the signal due to the detetor will depend on this sensitivity.

The fator ckiκi(jij′i), (i = 1, 2) desribes this property [8℄. We shall now onsider two

di(cid:27)erent ases.

2.1.1 Case-I : Detetors insensitive to eletron polarization

If the detetors(CMAs) are insensitive to the spin polarization of eletrons then the

pro jetion κi of the ki th omponent of the angular momentum is e(cid:27)etively zero, i.e. the

eletrons are emitted symmetrially with respet to the axis of the detetor. Hene the

attenuation fator an be written as

2.1.2 Case-II : Detetors sensitive to eletron polarization

In referene [1℄ we de(cid:28)ned ckiκi(jij′i) as the attenuation fator due to hange in the state

of polarization of an eletron by the detetor. When the detetors are insensitive to

eletron polarization one takes the average over the eletron spin and its pro jetion. Now

onsider the ase where the detetors are sensitive to eletron polarization. In this ase

the spin sensitivity of the detetors is desribed by a tensor of the form cksi κsi (sisi). In

this ase the attenuation fator turns out to be

x = Se

redues to Eq.(17).

The lifetime of the singly ionized state is very small. Depending on the photon energy

there may be a situation where it is impossible to di(cid:27)erentiate between the photo- and

the Auger eletrons with the energy analysis. Then to distinguish the two eletrons

it is neessary to measure the eletron spin, i.e. their polarization. For spin analysis

of the eletrons we have to use Stern-Gerlah type experimental set up. Here the fator

cksi κsi (sisi) exatly does the same i.e. piks out eletrons with a partiular spin pro jetion.

This type of experiment is known as `energy- and angle-resolved oinidene experiment'

and was being done by Shmidt and his o-workers [9℄.

In general for DPI of atoms using polarized photon of su(cid:30)ient energy one an dis-

tinguish the photo- and the Auger eletrons by di(cid:27)erential energy analysis. In that ase

determination of eletron spin is meaning less. Then if the spin is unobserved one an

take the average over the spin pro jetion. In that ase the pro jetion κi of the ki om-
ponent of the angular momentum is zero and the attenuation fator ckiκi(jij′i) turns out
to be cki0(jij′i).

3 Calulation and results

In referene [1℄ we have treated DPI in the xenon atom due to unpolarized light [1℄. In this

paper we are onerned with the same xenon atom with the di(cid:27)erene that DPI ours due

to a polarized light soure. A randomly oriented xenon atom is irradiated with a polarized

photon beam of energy 94.5 eV . As a result, the xenon atom no longer remains randomly

oriented but aquires the polarization of the photon beam. This leads to photoionization

1S0 Auger deay. We use the dipole
in the 4d5/2 shell followed by a subsequent N5−
approximation, the letters e, f and g for the three possible photoionization hannels [1℄.
εpp3/2
These are haraterised by e)4d5/2 −→
respetively. And the Auger transition is haraterised by the same partial wave εAd5/2 .

εpf5/2 and g)4d5/2 −→

εpf7/2 , f )4d5/2 −→

O23O23

The same seletion rules for photoionization and Auger transitions hold good as in the

ase of unpolarized light.

In experiments for measuring angular orrelation one usually hooses detetors whih

are insensitive to the spin polarization of eletrons. In suh a ase κ1 = κ2 = κ′1 = κ′2 =
κ = κ′ = 0 and Dk

00(β1θβ2) = Pk(cos θ). Then Eq. (16) beomes

Experiments on the xenon atom were arried out by Shmidt and his o-workers

using 94.5 eV synhrotron radiation [3℄. They used a perpendiular plane geometry to
desribe the proess. The ollision frame x, y, z is attahed to the target where the z

axis oinides with the diretion of the photon beam. The arbitrary polarization of the

inident beam from the synhrotron is desribed by the Stokes parameters S1, S2 and
S3 . Both S1 and S2 refer to the same quantity, but with di(cid:27)erently oriented axes. One
an make S2 = 0 by hoosing the x axis of the ollision frame to oinide with the

diretion of maximum linear polarization, i.e. the ma jor axis of the polarization ellipse.

To ompare our results with experimental values we use the same polar and azimuthal

angles in the perpendiular plane geometry. Here Fig.1 shows the perpendiular plane

geometry desribed above with e1 and e2 being the diretion of emission of the photo-
and the Auger eletron respetively and θ being the angle between their diretion of

emission. We have alulated the theoretial value of the angular orrelation funtion for

two di(cid:27)erent ases.

(i) The photo-eletron is observed in a (cid:28)xed diretion and the Auger eletron spetrometer

6

is turned around to get the angular distribution of the Auger eletron with respet to the

photo eletron. Here the maximum allowed value of k is 2j2 .

(ii)The seond one is the omplementary ase, i.e. the Auger eletron is observed in a

(cid:28)xed diretion and the photo-eletron spetrometer is turned around to get the angular

distribution of the photo-eletron with respet to the Auger eletron. Here the maximum

allowed value of k is 2j1,max .

The value of k gives the highest order of the Legendre polynomials ourring in the

orrelation funtion. Interhannel interation between the di(cid:27)erent photo eletron han-

nels ontributes to the angular orrelation pattern by introduing the di(cid:27)erent terms,

however, the total intensity remain unhanged. This inter hannel interation is treated

as it was in referene [1℄.

As in referene [1℄ we have de(cid:28)ned the angular orrelation funtion to be the angular

part of the expetation value of the e(cid:30)ieny operator. Solid lines represents the theo-

retially alulated plot and the dots represents the experimental plot [3℄. For a linearly

polarized inident photon beam the angular orrelation funtion for our ase turns out

to be

i) Case 1: S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 unknown. The photo-eletron is observed in a (cid:28)xed dire-

tion and the Auger eletron spetrometer is turned around to get the angular distribution

of the Auger eletron with respet to the photo-eletron.

W (θ)

1 + 1.314P2(cos θ) + 1.100P4(cos θ) .

(23)

∼

ii) Case 2: S1 = 1, S2 = 0, S3 unknown. The Auger eletron is observed in a (cid:28)xed

diretion and the photo-eletron spetrometer is turned around to get the angular distri-

bution of the photo-eletron with respet to the Auger eletron.

W (θ)

1 + 0.817P2(cos θ) + 0.602P4(cos θ) + 0.570P6(cos θ) .

(24)

∼

In both the ases one of the eletron spetrometer is kept (cid:28)xed along the diretion

of the eletri (cid:28)eld vetor (x-axis). The indies k in the general theoretial expression of
ε depend on the angular momenta of the emitted eletrons. Hene, the struture of the

angular orrelation pattern depends on these indies. If higher order angular momenta

are involved the angular orrelation pattern has more struture. This is lear from the

(cid:28)gures 2 and 3. Sine the distribution of the photo-eletron with respet to the (cid:28)xed

Auger eletron diretion involves higher order angular momenta, the angular orrelation

patterns has more strutures.

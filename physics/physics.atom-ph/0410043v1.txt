Abstract. We apply the optimized eﬀective potential method (OPM) to the
multiplet energies of the 3dn transition metal atoms, where the orbital dependence of
the energy functional with respect to orbital wave function is the single-conﬁguration
HF form. We ﬁnd that the calculated OPM exchange potential can be represented by
the following two forms. Firstly, the diﬀerence between OPM exchange potentials of
the multiplet states can be approximated by the linear combination of the potentials
derived from the Slater integrals F 2(3d, 3d) and F 4(3d, 3d) for the average energy of
the conﬁguration. Secondly, the OPM exchange potential can be expressed as the
linear combination of the OPM exchange potentials of the single determinants.

Analysis of OPM potentials for multiplet states of 3d transition metal atoms

1. Introduction

The density functional theory (DFT) has a important problem with the calculation
of transition metal complexes.
In spite of the recent development of the exchange-
correlation functionals, it is diﬃcult to evaluate the multiplet energies using the Kohn-
Sham method, because these electronic structures are not always written in a single
Slater determinant. Several methods have been proposed to calculate the multiplet
energies using DFT. One of these methods has been proposed by Ziegler [26], Wood [24]
and von Barth [25]. They have carried out the computation of the multiplet energies
using the diagonal sum rule, in which the sum of the multiplet energies is equal to
the corresponding sum of the single determinant energies. The method reproduces the
multiplet energies of p electron system, but the method does not give correct multiplet
energies for the d electron system. [4]

The time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has been recently
developed to calculate excited states including the multiplet states. The method has
been applied to p electron systems [23] within the adiabatic approximation. The
non-adiabatic TDDFT calculation, in which the exchange-correlation kernel becomes
frequency dependent, is still diﬃcult.

Another method was formally discussed in the G¨orling’s paper [28] in which the
energy functional depends on the multiplet states. They applied the optimized eﬀective
potential method to the calculation of the multiplet energies of p electron atoms. [14]
The optimized eﬀective potential method (OPM) was ﬁrstly proposed by Sharp and
Horton[1]. The method was applied to the Neon and Carbon atoms by Talman et.
al.[2]. G¨orling pointed out that OPM is formally regarded as DFT because the orbital
dependent energy functional implicitly depends on the density [27]. The OPM potential
can be evaluated by the singular integral equation called as the OPM equation. Talman
et. al.[2, 5] and Engel et. al.[22] solved the one-dimensional OPM equation for an atom,
in which the angular components of the OPM equation for an atom are integrated out
using the spherical symmetry. To eﬃciently calculate the OPM potentials for atoms
and molecules, G¨orling et. al. expanded the OPM potential using some base functions.
[14, 15, 16, 21] The base expansion method gives the same total energy as calculated by
Talman’s method. However, in the base expansion method, the OPM potential shows
spurious oscillations. To solve the problem, some methods have been proposed but still
are not applied to d electron atoms. [18, 19, 20]

An early work of OPM for the multiplet states is the OPM calculation by Aashamar
[5] who applied OPM to the ground multiplet of the atom of which atomic number is less
than 85. The OPM potentials for the p electron ground and excited state multiplets are
calculated by Nagy [6] using the KLI method.[8, 9] Furthermore, Aashamar also applied
OPM to the multiplet energies of p electron atoms using the multi-conﬁguration HF
form. [3] The total energies of the multiplet states have been discussed in these studies,
but the potentials of the multiplet states are not presented. Sala and G¨orling have
been developed the LHF method to approximately calculate the exchange only OPM

potential.
[11, 12, 13] Recently, the LHF method is extended to the open shell atoms
and molecules.[10] They applied the LHF method to the ground and excited multiplets
of p electron atoms and molecules. However, in these papers, they did not treat the
excited multiplet energies of the d electron atoms, which are diﬃcult to calculate using
the DFT. Furthermore, these studies give incorrect result caused by the approximation
methods such as the KLI or the LHF method.

In the present paper, we apply OPM to the ground and excited state multiplets
of the 3dn electron atoms using the total energy functional of the single-conﬁguration
HF [31] form. Following Talman and Engel[2, 22], we solve the one-dimensional OPM
equation correctly. The solution is considered to give the most reliable result among
all the available methods. We show that the diﬀerences between the OPM potentials
of the multiplet states can be approximated by the linear combination of the potentials
derived from F 2(3d, 3d),F 4(3d, 3d) Slater integrals. We numerically show that the OPM
exchange potential of multiplet state is approximated by the linear combination of the
OPM exchange potentials of the single determinants.

2. Optimized Eﬀective Potential Method

In the present paper, we calculate the OPM potential for eigenstates of an transition
metal atom. Each state is characterized by a deﬁnite value of the total orbital angular
momentum L and of the total spin angular momentum S. These multiplet energies
can be expressed as ELS,s, where s is the seniority number. The multiplet energy
level is degenerate for possible directions of total momentums L and S. Then, each
multiplet wavefunction Ψ(LSLzSz, s) can be written as a linear combination of single
Slater determinant functions Φ(LzSz, ν) which are not always eigenfunctions of the
atom. Lz and Sz are z component of the total momentums L and S, respectively, and
ν speciﬁes diﬀerent states with the same Lz and Sz component. Each total energy of
the single determinant is represented as ELzSz,ν.

Furthermore, we consider “average energy of the conﬁguration” Eav deﬁned by

Slater. [32, 31] For the 3dn multiplets, Eav is expressed as

Eav =

and ¯Pnili(h) = Pnili(r)/√r. The lower bound of h is set to -6.0 and the upper
bound, which depends on the kind of atom, is set around 7. The step size ∆h is
0.005. The integration in the OPM equation is approximated as the sum of the
product of integrand and step size. Using this simple approximation with the step
size ∆h = 0.01, the OPM equation is approximated to the set of linear equations for

by the self-consistent solution of the OPM equation (15) and the single electron equation
(6). The average radial density ρav(r) is calculated using equation (19).
In DFT,
the exchange energy is expressed as EDFTex[n(r)] where n(r) is an electron density.
To calculate averaged DFT potential, we used spherical averaged density ρav(r)/4πr2
denoted as nav(r). Then, the average energy for DFT is deﬁned as

In the bottom part of ﬁgure 1, we show the Xα exchange potential (α = 2/3), the
Becke’s GGA (B88) exchange potential [29], and the OPM exchange potential V av
ex (r) of
Mn2+. The OPM exchange potential is close to the Xα and B88 exchange potential. The
B88 exchange potential diverges at the nucleus, whereas the OPM exchange potential
does not diverge.

The radial density ρav(r) is shown in the top part of ﬁgure 1. There are some
kinks in the OPM exchange potential. The positions of the kinks correspond with the
positions of troughs in the radial density. The kinks in the B88 exchange potential are

smoother than that in the OPM exchange potential. For the Xα potential, the kinks
are not appeared.

In table 1, we show the average total energies (Equation (1)) using HF method
and OPM. The average total energy of DFT (Equation (20)) using Xα and Becke’s
GGA (B88) exchange functional is also tabulated in table 1. The total energy of the
OPM method is more closer to the HF total energy than that of the B88 and Xα.
The diﬀerence between the HF and OPM energies is order of 0.005 au throughout the
transition metals.

Secondly, we discuss the OPM exchange potentials for the 3dn multiplet states.
The 2-body part of the total energy of an atom (equation (7)) can be represented as the
linear combination of F k
ξ (ij). For the 3dn multiplet states, the coeﬃcients
3d,3d,2 and aξ
aξ
3d,3d,4 depend on the multiplet states, while the other coeﬃcients do not.
Therefore, the 2-body part of the total energy is expressed as

In order to discuss the equality of equations (25) and (26), we compare the
approximate OPM exchange potentials of V2+ multiplets with exact ones. The dotted
line of ﬁgure 3 exhibits the diﬀerence between the OPM exchange potential of the
multiplet states and that of the average energy calculated from equation (25). In the
solid line of ﬁgure 3, we show the same diﬀerence calculated from exact equation (24).
The dotted line of ﬁgure 3 close to the solid line. Small diﬀerences come from the neglect
of the multiplet dependence of the radial wave functions.

In third column of table 2, we show the approximate total energy of V2+ multiplets
calculated from equation (26). For comparison, the exact OPM total energies are
shown in second column of table 2.
If the total multiplet energies are deviate from
the average of conﬁguration, the approximate equation (26) poorly predicts the total
energies. However, the diﬀerences between the approximate and the exact total energies
are no more than 0.002 au. For the other 3dn transition metal atoms, the diﬀerences
between the approximate and the exact energies are no more than 0.005 au. Therefore,
we can conclude that the equation (25) and (26) work as the approximation formula of
the exchange potential and the total energy for the multiplet states, respectively.

Finally, we discuss the relation between the OPM exchange potential for the

are represented as the linear combination of the single determinants Φ(LzSz, ν). If the
radial components of the wavefunctions do not depend on the multiplet states, the single

for spin up and down state, respectively.
In the solid line of ﬁgure 6, we show the
diﬀerence potential calculated from exact equation (24). We ﬁnd, from ﬁgure 6, that
the approximate diﬀerence potential ( dotted line ) is very close to the exact one ( solid
line ).

In the fourth column of table 2, we show the approximate total energy calculated
from equation (30). We compare the approximate total energy with exact OPM total
energy presented in second column of table 2. The diﬀerence between the approximate
total energy and the exact one is no more than 0.004 au. For the other 3d transition
metal atoms, the diﬀerence between two energies is no more than 0.01 au. Therefore,
the exchange potential for the multiplet state can be evaluated using the theory such
as the density functional theory, where the electronic structure is based on the single
determinant,

5. Conclusion

We applied OPM to the multiplet energies of the 3d transition metal atoms using the
total energy functional of the single-conﬁguration HF [31] form. The calculated OPM
exchange potential can be approximated by the Xα and B88 exchange potentials in
r > 0.1 au. For near nucleus region (r < 0.1 au ), the OPM exchange potential
strongly deviates from the Xα and B88 exchange potentials. The diﬀerence between
the OPM exchange potential for the multiplet states and that for the average energy
is quite smaller than the OPM exchange potential. The OPM exchange potential for
the multiplet state of the 3d transition metal atom can be represented as the linear
combination of V ξ
E0. We ﬁnd that the OPM exchange potential
F 2
can be approximated by the linear combination of multiplet independent potentials
V av
. This result indicates that the total energy functional can be
F 2
represented as linear combination of the terms which are the product of the multiplet
independent quantities derived from the Slater integrals (F 2
av(3d, 3d))
and the multiplet dependent quantities (aLS,s

The multiplet state of the 3d transition metal atom is represented as the linear
combination of the single determinants. From our calculation result, we ﬁnd that
the OPM exchange potential of the multiplet state can be approximated as the linear
combination of the OPM exchange potentials of the single determinants. The result
might be similar to the methods of Ziegler [26], Wood [24] and von Barth [25]. However
our result shows that the d electron multiplet state energy should be evaluated by
including multiplet dependency to the total energy functional.

We investigate the helium atom embedded in a superstrong magnetic ﬁeld γ = 100-10000 au. All
eﬀects due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass for vanishing pseudomomentum are taken into account. The
inﬂuence and the magnitude of the diﬀerent ﬁnite mass eﬀects are analyzed and discussed. Within
our full conﬁguration interaction approach calculations are performed for the magnetic quantum
numbers M=0,−1,−2,−3, singlet and triplet states, as well as positive and negative z parities. Up
to six excited states for each symmetry are studied. With increasing ﬁeld strength the number of
bound states decreases rapidly and we remain with a comparatively small number of bound states
for γ = 104 au within the symmetries investigated here.

I. INTRODUCTION

The term “strong” ﬁeld characterizes a situation for which the system is in the nonperturbative regime, i.e. where
the magnetic forces are of the same order of magnitude or greater than the Coulomb binding force. For the ground
state of the hydrogen atom this corresponds to ﬁeld strengths γ & 1 a.u. (1 a.u. corresponds to 2.35 × 105 T). We
refer to the term “superstrong” to indicate a ﬁeld strength of 100 atomic units and more.

The motivation to study atoms and molecules in strong magnetic ﬁelds originates from several sources. Certainly
the properties of atoms and molecules in strong magnetic ﬁelds are interesting from a pure theoretical point of view.
Due to the competition of the spherically symmetric Coulomb potential and the cylindrically symmetric magnetic ﬁeld
interaction we encounter a nonseparable, nonintegrable problem already for a one-electron system, i.e. the hydrogen
atom. Therefore it is necessary to develop new techniques to solve the Schr¨odinger equation in strong magnetic ﬁelds.
The discovery of strong magnetic ﬁelds on the surface of magnetic white dwarfs (102–104 T) and neutron stars (104–
107 T) is a further major motivation. The spectra of these astrophysical objects can be dominated by the inﬂuence
of magnetic and electric ﬁelds. For the analysis of atmospheres of magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars, it is very
important to have reliable data on the behavior of matter in strong magnetic ﬁelds. As an example we mention the
the white dwarf GrW+70◦8247. The interpretation of its spectrum was very important for the understanding of the
properties of spectra of magnetic white dwarfs in general (see Refs. [1–5]).

Highly accurate data are available for hydrogen in strong magnetic ﬁelds (see e.g. [6,7]). This system is now
understood to a very high degree. But there is also a signiﬁcant interest in accurate data on heavier elements such
as He, Na, Fe and molecules. Especially helium plays an important role in the atmosphere of certain magnetic white
dwarfs (see e.g. [8–10]).

There were several attempts to calculate accurate energies for bound states of helium, but for astrophysical appli-
cations an accuracy of approximately 10−4 for the energies is needed for a large number of levels. We will concentrate
here on investigations that address the high ﬁeld regime: In 1975 Mueller et al. [11] calculated the few lowest levels
of He for γ up to 20000 a.u. using a variational approach. Virtamo [12] presented Hartree-Fock calculations on
the ground state (which is a triplet state with magnetic quantum number equal to −1). The same state has been
considered by Pr¨oschl [13] in 1982 in the range 21 – 21000 au. Vincke and Baye [14] provide correlated calculations
(γ=4.2, 42 and 420 a.u.) for the lowest singlet and triplet states with positive z parity and magnetic quantum numbers
M =0,−1,−2. In the work of Thurner [15] several triplet states are considered in the very broad range γ=8 × 10−4 —
8 × 103 a.u. We mention also the important work by Becken and Schmelcher, which covers the same symmetries
and the same number of excited states in the broad range γ = 8 × 10−4 — 100 a.u. of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
published in a series of papers [16–19].

The properties of matter in superstrong magnetic ﬁelds are especially interesting for the physics of cold neutron
stars [20–22]. But for the case of superstrong magnetic ﬁelds the ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects become increasingly
important. This is due to the fact, that energy shifts, caused by the ﬁnite nuclear mass, are of the order of γ/M0,
where M0 is the mass of the nucleus. Evidently this correction is for superstrong magnetic ﬁelds of the same order of
magnitude as the ionization energies.

Of course the conceptual and in particular the computational situation becomes more complex when the full
Hamiltonian, i.e. for ﬁnite nuclear mass, is taken into account. For both neutral [23,24] as well as charged systems
[23–32] we encounter couplings among the diﬀerent electrons as well as couplings between the collective and electronic
motion.

1

Some approximations to the ionic problem are available: An approximate separation of the collective and relative
motion of the charged system has been introduced in [25] and applied to calculate the ﬁnite nuclear mass corrections
for low-lying levels of hydrogenic ions in a magnetic ﬁeld [26]. Elaborated MCHF computations as well as adiabatic
approximations were given in Ref. [32]. However these approaches cannot be used to calculate accurate results for
all ﬁeld strengths and all states investigated here. We mention that the behavior of the ion He+ has to be known in
order to determine the ionization energies of the neutral He atom.

In the present paper we provide a full conﬁguration interaction calculation for helium in superstrong magnetic
ﬁelds. All ﬁnite mass eﬀects at zero pseudomomentum are taken into account and are analyzed. In section II we
will describe the Hamiltonian, and some technical details concerning our calculation. Furthermore we provide some
remarks on the problem of the threshold energies. In section III we analyze the deviations of the Hamiltonian in the
inﬁnite nuclear mass frame from the full Hamiltonian. Ionization energies and transition wavelengths, resulting from
our calculations, are provided in Sect. IV.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

A. Hamiltonian and Symmetries

To investigate the He atom we use a nonrelativistic approach. This is well justiﬁed by the fact, that relativistic
corrections have been shown to be very small in strong and even superstrong magnetic ﬁelds [33,34]. For the sake
of simplicity we take the electronic spin g factor to be 2, but our results can be easily adapted to any g factor
by multiplying the spin operators and their eigenvalues by g/2. On the other hand, the ionization energies, and
transition wavelengths, which are presented in this paper are not aﬀected by this choice. The magnetic ﬁeld vector
will be denoted by B, whereas its magnitude will be denoted by γ = |B|. The magnetic ﬁeld vector B is chosen to
point in z direction.

The ﬁrst step in our approach is the pseudoseparation of the collective and relative motion for the Hamiltonian in
the laboratory frame [23,24,35] which exploits the conservation of the so-called pseudomomentum K. The resulting
transformed Hamiltonian is divided into three parts, which are denoted by H1, H2, and H3. The operator H1 =
K2/(2MA) involves only center of mass (CM) degrees of freedom, where MA is the mass of the atom. H3 contains
exclusively electronic degrees of freedom. The operator H2 = K/MA · B ×
i ri represents the coupling between H1
and H3, i.e. the CM and electronic degrees of freedom. It involves the motional electric ﬁeld 1/MA(B × K) which
arises due to the motion of the (neutral) atom in the magnetic ﬁeld and is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld. This coupling is proportional to the pseudomomentum, and therefore vanishes for vanishing pseudomomentum.
The pseudoseparation is possible for neutral systems only, since only then all components of the pseudomomentum
commute.

P

Within the present work we assume a vanishing pseudomomentum. Therefore we have no additional motional
electric ﬁeld and all eﬀects due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass are included in H3 which is a function of the mass of the
nucleus M0 and the magnetic ﬁeld γ. In atomic units the electronic Hamiltonian takes the following form (internal
coordinates are taken with respect to the nucleus):

H(M0, γ) = Hrm + Hmp

The reduced masses are µ = 1/(1+1/M0) and µ′ = 1/(1−1/M0). The Hamiltonian can be considered to consist of three
i , the Zeeman terms 1/(2µ′)B · li, the diamagnetic
parts. The ﬁrst part contains the one-particle operators 1/(2µ)p2
terms 1/(8µ)(B × ri)2, the attractive Coulomb interaction with the nucleus −2/|ri|, and the spin Zeeman terms

B · si. The second part contains the two particle operator (2.3), which describes the repulsive Coulomb interaction
between the two electrons. The third operator is the so-called mass polarization operator Hmp.
It arises due to
the transformation of the laboratory coordinates to the internal coordinates, which are relative to the nucleus. The
reader should note that the Hamiltonian (2.1) has the same good quantum numbers as the Hamiltonian for inﬁnite
nuclear mass: the total spin S2, the z component Sz of the total spin, the magnetic quantum number M and the total
spatial z parity Πz (parity is not an independent symmetry, it can be deduced from these corresponding symmetry
In the following we will denote the states by ν2S+1M Πz , where 2S + 1 is the spin multiplicity and
operations).
ν = 1, 2, 3 . . . denotes the degree of excitation within a given subspace.

If we compare H(M0, γ) in Eq. (2.1) to the electronic Hamiltonian of helium in the inﬁnite nuclear mass frame
[16] H(∞, γ), we observe two diﬀerent kinds of corrections due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass. The ﬁrst is due to the
occurrence of the reduced masses µ and µ′ in Hrm which are the so called normal mass corrections. The spectrum
of the Hamiltonian Hrm which contains exclusively these normal mass corrections can be related to the spectrum of
the Hamiltonian H(∞, γ′) at a diﬀerent ﬁeld strength γ′, via a unitarian transformation and an additional trivial
energy shift (see section III and also Refs. [6,16,36]). The second type of ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects is due to the
mass polarization operators Hmp. We will call these speciﬁc ﬁnite mass corrections. They are by no means trivial
and are related to the correlation of the electrons (the corresponding operators contain one-particle operators of both
electrons). If the electrons behave in a correlated way, the speciﬁc nuclear mass eﬀects are enhanced. Note that these
operators are a consequence of the transformation from the laboratory to our non-inertial system thereby eliminating
the CM degrees of freedom.

B. Technical remarks

Some comments concerning our computational approach are in order. Its basic ingredient is an anisotropic Gaussian
basis set, which was put forward by Schmelcher and Cederbaum [37]. This one-particle basis is suﬃciently ﬂexible to
to describe ﬁnite electronic systems for any ﬁeld strength and was successfully applied to several atoms and molecules
in magnetic ﬁelds [16–18,38–41].

This basis set is not only ﬂexible: in the case of atoms all matrix element can be calculated analytically and in par-
ticular evaluated eﬃciently [16,17]. The price, which has to be paid, is that for each ﬁeld strength and each symmetry,
the basis set has to be (nonlinearly) optimized. This is achieved by variationally computing the eigenfunctions of the
corresponding one-particle problems (H, He+, etc). This task is time consuming and needs experience, because the
starting values for the nonlinear variational parameters have to be chosen carefully in oder to obtain well-converged
results. In recent times however this has become more comfortable and was speeded up by new optimization algo-
rithms and tools, which allow an almost automatic construction of a basis set. The implementation of these tools
still needs a proper selection of the coeﬃcients and an evaluation of the outcome of the optimization. The latter is
of particular importance for the ﬁeld regime addressed in the present work for which small changes in the basis set
can have a considerable eﬀect on the results of the full problem, i.e. the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of H(M0, γ)
in Eq. (2.1). A one particle basis set typically consists of 200–400 basis functions, which combine 3000 to 5000 two
particle conﬁgurations. The full CI approach leads then to a generalized eigenvalue problem. Numerical problems
arise in this generalized eigenvalue problem if near linear dependencies in the basis set arise. These dependencies
cannot fully be avoided, but the resulting numerical instabilities can be removed by a cutoﬀ of the small eigenvalues
of the corresponding overlap matrix.

The most CPU time consuming part in the above approach, is the evaluation of the electron-electron matrix
elements. Although analytical formulas for all matrix elements are available, it is important to have eﬃcient algorithms
for their evaluation, since the matrix elements for the electron-electron Coulomb interaction are by no means trivial.
A detailed and sophisticated analysis of their analytical representation is crucial. In the simplest form it contains
multiple sums over hypergeometric functions [16,17]. For the evaluation of the hypergeometric function all possible
analytical continuation formulas have been worked out (see Ref. [42]) and made it possible to reduce the time for the
calculation of the matrix elements by a factor of 50 compared to a straightforward implementation. We emphasize
that the present investigation would have been impossible without this eﬃcient implementation of the evaluation of
the matrix elements.

The result of the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem are the total energies of the system. These energies
are however not of primary interest: they increase almost linearly with the magnetic ﬁeld strength due to the raise

of the kinetic energy in the presence of the ﬁeld. The relevant energies are e.g. the transition and ionization energies
which are for the high ﬁeld regime addressed here by several orders of magnitude smaller than the total energies and
therefore ‘hidden’ in the total energies. To obtain the ionization energies we need to know the energy of the He+
ion taking into account the ﬁnite nuclear mass in the magnetic ﬁeld. These energies for He+ are unfortunately not
known exactly. In contrast to this the energies for He+ assuming an inﬁnite nuclear mass can be calculated from
the well-known energies for the hydrogen atom with ﬁxed nucleus in strong magnetic ﬁelds (see e.g. Ref. [7]) via the
corresponding scaling relations (see for example [6]). However the energies of the He+ ion with ﬁnite nuclear mass
cannot be extracted from results for the hydrogen atom (with ﬁnite or inﬁnite nuclear mass) because of the unique
coupling between the collective and electronic motion which has to be taken into account. This coupling inherently
mixes the collective and electronic motion and the exact ground state therefore combines both motions. The moving
He+–ion in a strong magnetic ﬁeld is a problem which has not been solved numerically exactly in the literature. As
a result the exact threshold energy for He+ + e− is not known. Using the threshold energy of He+ + e− for ﬁxed
nucleus Eth

f n provides a wrong description of the threshold energies in superstrong ﬁelds.

The Hamiltonian for the helium positive ion reads in atomic units as follows:

H0 = Ha + Hb + Hc

Here Ha describes the collective motion of the ion as a free particle with charge 1 and mass M0+1 moving in a magnetic
ﬁeld (R and P are the center of mass coordinate and momentum, respectively). The operator Hb couples electronic
and collective motion. The operator Hc is the electronic part of the He+ Hamiltonian with ω1 = 1 + 1/(M0 + 1)2 and
ω2 = 1 + (2M0 + 1)/(M0 + 1)2.

Although the exact threshold energy for He+ + e− is not available some approximations to it have been calculated
in the literature. One of those approximations Eth
zpmc ignores the coupling between the collective and electronic motion
Hb. The corresponding threshold values consist of the sum of eigenenergies of the electronic Hamiltonian Hc and the
zero point energy for Ha. The zero point energy for the collective motion is the corresponding energy for the lowest
Landau level. The energy for this threshold is typically too high, i.e. the true ionization energies are overestimated,
since the coupling Hb, which is neglected in this approximation, tends to reduce the threshold energy. All ionization
energies shown in the present work are calculated by applying Eth

zpmc.

The second approximation we will choose, ignores the zero point energy of the ion and the coupling term, i.e. Ha
and Hb. Therefore, only the eigenenergies of the mass corrected electronic Hamiltonian Hc are taken into account.
This threshold is denoted as Eth
mc. It is motivated by the fact, that for an inﬁnitely strong magnetic ﬁeld the energetic
contributions due to the zero point energy of Ha and the coupling Hb exactly cancel. A third alternative threshold
energy Eth
ad is obtained by employing the adiabatic expansion approach presented in [32]. Since this approximation
only takes into account the lowest Landau energy for the CM motion, it becomes increasingly accurate for increasing
energetic separation between the Landau levels (and therefore increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength). For ﬁeld strengths
below 2000 a.u. this approximation is not reliable. It can be observed, that the threshold Eth
ad approaches the threshold
energy Eth

ad is expected to be very accurate for suﬃcient high ﬁeld strengths.

III. THE FINITE NUCLEAR MASS EFFECTS

There is a transformation, which connects the spectrum of the inﬁnite nuclear mass Hamiltonian H(∞, γ) with the

spectrum of the Hamiltonian Hrm [16]. This transformation reads as follows:

U Hrm U −1 = µH(∞,

(lzi + szi).

(3.1)

Here U denotes a unitarian transformation, which transforms r → r/µ and p → pµ. The second term on the right
hand side of Eq. (3.1) represents a ﬁeld dependent trivial energy shift, since the total z component of the spin and
the total z component of the orbital angular momentum are conserved quantities.

From equation (3.1) it can be seen, that the leading mass correction is of the order of γ/M0. For the states with
magnetic quantum number M < 0, this correction is positive. This means that the corresponding energy levels
increase linearly with γ and eventually pass the ionization threshold. The latter implies that the
are shifted i.e.
corresponding bound electronic state becomes ionized. This shift depends exclusively on the magnetic quantum
number M , the total z component of the spin Sz, the magnetic ﬁeld strength γ, and the nuclear mass M0.

The energy diﬀerence ∆Erm=Erm(γ)−E(∞, γ), where Erm denotes the eigenvalues of Hrm and E(∞, γ) the eigen-
rm.

rm of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian He

values of H(∞, γ), can be related to the energy diﬀerence ∆Ee
The operator He

f describes two free noninteracting electrons

f and He

whereas He

rm refers to the corresponding ‘artiﬁcial’ Hamiltonian with reduced masses

For the energetically lowest Landau level with negative magnetic quantum number M and vanishing momentum in
z direction we have

It cannot be expected, that the normal mass corrections of the helium atom ∆Ee
rm follow exactly equation (3.4),
because the Hamiltonian Hrm contains the interaction between the two electrons and of the electrons with the
nucleus. However it is suggestive to introduce a parameter δ(γ) such that

∆Erm = Erm(γ) − E(∞, γ) = ∆Ee

rm(γ) {1 + δ(γ)} .

For the states and ﬁeld strengths investigated in the present work we have δ(γ) ≪ 1. Therefore δ can be treated
as a correction term. Since this correction is due to the Coulomb interaction it is state dependent. In Fig. 1 the
quantity δ is shown as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength γ for a few selected singlet states belonging to several
diﬀerent symmetries. It can be seen, that δ(γ), for all states considered, follows a power law δ(γ) = C · γ−λ, where
the exponent λ ≈ 0.62 does not depend on the state. However the corresponding proportionality constant C varies
over nearly one order of magnitude for the diﬀerent states.

To understand more on the behavior of the quantity δ we expand the ﬁrst part on the right hand side of Eq. (3.1)

in powers of 1/M0. Omitting the spin part we obtain:

Here the prime indicates the derivative with respect to the ﬁeld strength. Now ∆Erm and consequently δ can be
expressed in terms of the eigenenergies of H(∞, γ):

δ =

−E(∞, γ) + 2γE′(∞, γ) + γ|M |
γ(1 + |M |)

− 1.

Now the state dependency of δ can be understood as the dependence on the derivative of the eigenenergies E(∞, γ)
with respect to the ﬁeld strength. We emphasize, that the quantities E(∞, γ) and γE′(∞, γ) in Eq.
(3.7) are
almost equal and therefore approximately cancel in the superstrong ﬁeld regime. Thus δ(γ) can be approximated by
δ(γ) ≈ (E′(∞, γ) + |M |)/(1 + |M |) − 1.

Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the mass polarization energies |Emp| = |E(M0, γ) − Erm(γ)| for the energetically lowest singlet
states and Fig. 2 (b) for the corresponding triplet states. Here E(M0, γ) denotes the eigenenergies of H(M0, γ). First
we observe, that the absolute values of Emp are very small: For γ = 104 they are at least eight orders of magnitude
smaller than the corresponding total energies. They are also small compared to the normal ﬁnite mass corrections
∆Erm. For γ = 104 Emp is at least four orders of magnitude smaller the normal ﬁnite mass corrections. Opposite to the
quantity ∆Erm the behavior of |Emp| depends strongly on the state. For the states 110+,11(−1)+,11(−2)+,11(−3)+

the quantity |Emp| increases. These states contain so-called magnetically tightly bound orbitals [6,43,44] and therefore
their ionization energy diverges logarithmically in the limit γ → ∞. An increase of the inﬂuence of |Emp| can also
be observed in Fig. 2 (b) for the states 13(−1)+,13(−2)+ and 13(−3)+, which represent also magnetically tightly
bound states. For the remaining states 110−, 11(−1)− and the corresponding triplet states as well for 130+ |Emp|
remains almost constant as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. This eﬀect can be easily understood: For the
magnetically tightly bound states the electrons are close to each other in a relatively narrow region of space and
therefore electron correlation is important. The mass polarization operator is sensitive to electronic correlation, due
to the fact that it contains operators of both electrons. The sign of Emp is not shown in Fig. 2. It is positive for
the states related to the above mentioned tightly bound states and negative for the others. The only exception is the
state 130+, which does not belong to the tightly bound states, but nevertheless Emp has a positive sign.

In the following we will present our results for the ionization energies and transition wavelengths of the helium
atom for magnetic ﬁelds ranging from 100 au to 10000 au. These investigations have been performed for the magnetic
quantum numbers M = 0, −1, −2, −3, singlet and triplet states and positive and negative z parity. Only for the
magnetic quantum number M = −3 exclusively positive z parity states have been studied. For most symmetry
subspaces we investigated 6 excited states.

IV. RESULTS

A. Ionization energies

According to the above the reader should keep in mind, that the exact energy of the ionization threshold is not
known, and therefore the ionization energies are not known accurately. However the ionization energies calculated by
using diﬀerent approximative threshold energies Eth
ad show the same trend: the number of bound
states of the helium atom becomes ﬁnite for superstrong magnetic ﬁelds in contrast to the situation without a magnetic
ﬁeld, or in the limit of an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus, where the helium atom has an inﬁnite number of bound states. Only
the so-called magnetically tightly bound states are bound within the complete regime of ﬁeld strengths and quantum
numbers considered in the present work. We consider in the following the quantity Eion = Eth
zpmc − E(M0, γ) as a
function of the ﬁeld strength together with the above mentioned approximations for the threshold.

zpmc, Eth

mc, Eth

f n, Eth

Fig. 3 (a) shows Eion for the six energetically lowest states of zero magnetic quantum number and positive z parity.
The 110+ state is the most tightly bound state. In strong magnetic ﬁelds it represents however not the ground state
of the atom, because energetically low-lying states are fully spin-polarized in the high ﬁeld regime. The ground state
is given by the 13(−1)+ state, which is also a tightly bound state. Fig. 3 (a) shows, that Eion increases for the tightly
bound state 110+, but remains approximately constant for all other states as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Furthermore we observe that all states ν10+ with ν > 1 as well as the corresponding triplet states pass the threshold
energies being either Eth
mc with increasing ﬁeld strength. The only remaining bound state for γ = 104 au is
the 110+ state.

ad or Eth

In Fig. 3 (b) the corresponding quantity for states with M = 0 and negative z parity are shown. For these states
Eion as a function of γ varies only to a very minor extent, which is due to the fact, that none of these states is a
tightly bound one, and none of these states remains bound when γ approaches 104 au. For the triplet states with
negative z parity the quantity Eion decreases slightly, for γ > 100 au. This is not due to the ﬁnite mass eﬀect, but can
be also observed for the quantity Eth
f n − E(∞, γ), whereas this quantity increases monotonically for all other states
investigated in the present work. The reason is the complicated interplay between correlation, which tends to increase
ionization energies and Coulomb repulsion, which tends to decrease it. For the states with M = 0 the electrons are
conﬁned in a very small domain of space, which increases correlation as well as the Coulomb repulsion. On the other
hand for triplet states the electrons are separated, because the wavefunction is antisymmetric, which reduces both
eﬀects. For the ν30− states the increase of correlation energy is smaller than the increase of the Coulomb repulsion
energy.

In ﬁgure 4 (a) Eion is shown for the states ν2S+1(−1)+. For the magnetically tightly bound states 11(−1)+ and
13(−1)+ the ionization energy remains positive, i.e. these states are bound in the complete regime γ < 104 au. For
higher excited states, i.e. ν2S+1(−1)+ with ν > 1 the energy E(M0, γ) becomes even larger than Eth
zpmc and therefore
Eion decreases strongly on the logarithmic scale. To understand this we review Eq. (3.1): The dominant term on the
right hand side is of the form −M γ/M0 (the spin part does not aﬀect the ionization energies). Therefore E(M0, γ) for
states with M < 0 raises about this amount and will pass the threshold at lower ﬁeld strength than their counterparts
with M = 0.

6

In Fig. 4 (b) we show our results for Eion for M = −1 and negative z parity. A similar behavior to that of the states
ν2S+1(−1)+, with ν > 1 is observed: The ionization energy as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength decreases
rapidly. This is due to the fact, as mentioned above, that the ﬁnite mass corrections force these states to pass even
the Eth
zpmc threshold and the states become unbound. For negative z parity tightly bound states do not exist.

In Fig. 5 (a) we present our results for Eion for the energetically lowest singlet and triplet states with M = −2 and
positive z parity. Similar to Fig. 4 (a) the quantity Eion rises for the two energetically lowest singlet and triplet states
from 1.8 au to approximately 10 au. These two states belong to the magnetically tightly bound states. However in
contrast to Eion for the 22S+1(−1)+ states in Fig. 4 (a) Eion for the state 21(−2)+, which is the ﬁrst excited singlet
state of this symmetry, does also rise and stays bound within the complete regime of ﬁeld strength considered here.
This is a remarkable feature since the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite mass eﬀects for this state is even bigger than for the
states with M = −1. The reason for this behavior lies in the presence of an avoided crossing which takes place at
γ ≈ 100 au. It can be seen that Eion for the higher excited singlet states is raised as well and it approaches the
corresponding value for the next energetically higher triplet state.

The ionization energies for the negative z parity states for M = −2 in Fig. 5 (b) look similar to these of the M = −1
in Fig. 4 (b). Magnetically tightly bound states do not exist for M = −2 and negative parity, therefore all states of
this symmetry become unbound with increasing ﬁeld strength. As mentioned above the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear
mass increases with increasing magnetic quantum number |M |, therefore the states ν2S+1(−2)− become unbound at
lower ﬁeld strengths than the corresponding states with magnetic quantum number M = −1.

In Fig. 6 we encounter that Eion for the energetically lowest singlet and triplet states with M = −3 and positive
z parity is positive for all ﬁeld strengths, considered in the present work. These two states belong to the magnetically
tightly bound states. Similar to Fig. 5 (a) an avoid crossing takes place at γ ≈ 200 au. This can be more clearly seen
if the quantity Eth
f n − E(∞, γ) is considered. But unlike to the case of M = −2, where Eion for the ﬁrst excited singlet
state is raised, here the triplet state 23(−3)+ is shifted to lower energies and remains therefore bound for relatively
high ﬁeld strengths. Nevertheless, the state 23(−3)+ passes the ionization threshold for γ approaching 104 au and
therefore becomes unbound due to the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects.

B. Transition wavelengths

In contrast to the ionization energies, which strongly depend on the exact values for the threshold energies, transition
wavelengths can be calculated from total energies without the knowledge of the exact threshold energy. The only
feature which remains unknown for the transition wavelengths is the exact ﬁeld strength, foe which the particular
bound-bound transition disappears. Therefore we refer the total energy of a state to the threshold Eth
zpmc in order to
decide upon its bound character as a function of the ﬁeld strength. According to the discussion provided in Sect. II C
the true ﬁeld strength for which the state becomes unbound is lower than the value obtained by refering the total
energies to Eth

zpmc.

Some general remarks on our results for the transition wavelengths presented in Figs. 7 – 14 are in order. Linearly
polarized transitions show the general feature, that there are two separated parts of the spectrum. A few transition
wavelengths become shorter, following approximately a power law as a function of the ﬁeld strength. Other transition
wavelengths, which are much longer, stay almost constant as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The short
wavelengths correspond to transitions involving the magnetically tightly bound states. The other lines correspond to
transitions between higher excited states.

For circular polarized transitions the appearance of the spectrum of wavelengths is diﬀerent. Only for circular
polarized transitions which involve states with positive z parity a separated bundle of short wavelengths is present.
This is again due to the presence of tightly bound states for positive z parity but their absence for negative z parity
states. Transitions between higher excited states which do not involve tightly bound states, look diﬀerent than their
corresponding linear polarized transitions: the wavelengths increase or decrease as a function of γ. In the case of
circular polarized transitions, states belonging to diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers M are involved and therefore
the energy of the state with the higher absolute value of the magnetic quantum number M raises more strongly with
increasing ﬁeld strength than the energy of the state with the lower magnetic quantum number. This again goes
back to the nuclear mass eﬀects contained in Eq. (3.1) and yields the increase or decrease of the wavelengths for the
circular polarized transitions with increasing ﬁeld strengths.

In Fig. 7 the transition wavelengths for the singlet and triplet transitions among the ν2S+10+ and µ2S+10− states
are shown. The separation mentioned above, which is a general feature for linearly polarized transitions is obvious.
The short wavelengths are the transitions involving the most tightly bound state 110+. According to Fig. 3 (a) its
ionization energy increases with increasing ﬁeld strength, whereas the ionization energy of all other (excited) states
varies only marginally.

7

The circular polarized transition wavelengths shown in Fig. 8 involve the ν2S+10+ and µ2S+1(−1)+ symmetry
subspaces. Separated by a large energetically gap there is a bundle of short wavelengths, which is due to transitions
to the magnetically tightly bound states 110+,11(−1)+ and 13(−1)+ and a long wavelength part.

The spectrum of circular polarized transitions among the subspaces ν2S+10− and µ2S+1(−1)−, shown in Fig. 9 shows
also the characteristics of circular polarized transitions discussed above. Since in this case only states with negative
z parity are involved, we have no tightly bound states,and the part of the spectrum with very short wavelengths is
missing.

The behavior of the wavelengths of the linear polarized transition from the ν2S+1(−1)+ states to the µ2S+1(−1)−
states is shown in Fig. 10 and looks similar to the one given in Fig. 7. Two well separated parts of the spectrum can
be distinguished: Short wavelengths, which are due to transitions to the magnetically tightly bound states 11(−1)+
and 13(−1)+ and decrease as a function of the ﬁeld strength. Transition wavelengths between higher excited states,
with wavelengths larger than 1000 ˚Angstrøm, remain approximately constant. Due to the fact, that the inﬂuence of
the ﬁnite nuclear mass is more signiﬁcant than for those shown in Fig. 7, much less lines belonging to bound-bound
transitions are present.

The spectrum shown in Fig. 11 for the symmetry subspaces ν2S+1(−1)+ and µ2S+1(−2)+ diﬀers in some respect
from the common pattern of circularly polarized transitions. Similar to other spectra circular polarized transitions,
wavelengths involving transitions to the tightly bound states (11(−1)+,13(−1)+,11(−2)+,13(−2)+) can be easily iden-
tiﬁed. As a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, these wavelengths follow approximatively a power law. On the
other hand there are structures shown in Fig. 11, which arise due to the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear mass. However
in the gap between these two parts of the spectrum, additional lines occur which are caused by avoided crossings.
The transitions ν2S+1(−1)− to µ2S+1(−2)− shown in Fig. 12 show the clear signature described above for circular
polarized transitions. Only a few lines belong to bound-bound transitions.

The spectral transitions given in Fig. 13 (ν2S+1(−2)+ to µ2S+1(−2)−) show the typical behavior of linear polarized
transitions. Deviating from the general pattern, transition wavelengths to the state 21(−2)+ form their own bundle
of short wavelengths, being located between the wavelengths of the transitions of the tightly bound states 11(−2)+
and 13(−2)+ and the transitions among higher excited states.

The spectrum of transitions among the subspaces ν2S+1(−2)+ to µ2S+1(−3)+ is shown in Fig. 14. Transitions
to the magnetically tightly bound states 11(−2)+,13(−2)+, 11(−3)+, 13(−3)+ can be clearly identiﬁed. Also the
transitions dominated by the normal ﬁnite mass eﬀects can be seen for long wavelengths. Additionally the inﬂuence
of the avoided crossings is visible.

V. BRIEF SUMMARY

We have presented the ﬁrst systematic full CI calculations for helium in superstrong magnetic ﬁelds, taking into
account the eﬀects of ﬁnite nuclear mass. These eﬀects are extremely important in the superstrong ﬁeld regime,
because the relevant parameter for the importance of the ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects is γ/M0. We analyzed the
inﬂuence of the normal and the speciﬁc ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects. It has been shown that the leading ﬁnite nuclear
mass eﬀect, does not depend on the state, but only on the magnetic quantum number. The state dependent part of
the normal ﬁnite mass eﬀects depends on the derivative with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the total energy
of the corresponding state in the inﬁnite nuclear mass frame. Furthermore it has been shown, that the speciﬁc mass
eﬀects, which are caused by the mass polarization operators, are very small compared to the total energies and small
compared to the leading normal mass eﬀects ∆Ee

rm.

In the superstrong magnetic ﬁeld regime, the spectrum of helium is cut oﬀ by the eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear mass.

We found that only a comparatively small number of

states is bound in the complete regime of magnetic ﬁeld strengths investigated in the present work. Although the
exact ionization threshold for helium is unknown, all available approximations to the exact threshold conﬁrm this
trend. Transition wavelengths for many linear and circular polarized transitions were provided. Their typical behavior
has been identiﬁed and the eﬀects of the ﬁnite mass on the transition wavelengths has been analyzed.

The determination of the critical ﬁeld strengths (i.e. the ﬁeld strengths where the individual states become unbound)

require a detailed investigation of the ground state of the moving helium positive ion in a magnetic ﬁeld.

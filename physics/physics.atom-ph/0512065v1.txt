Abstract

We propose a new laser cooling method for atomic species whose level structure makes traditional

laser cooling diﬃcult. For instance, laser cooling of hydrogen requires single-frequency vacuum-

ultraviolet light, while multielectron atoms need single-frequency light at many widely separated

frequencies. These restrictions can be eased by laser cooling on two-photon transitions with ul-

trafast pulse trains. Laser cooling of hydrogen, antihydrogen, and many other species appears

feasible, and extension of the technique to molecules may be possible.

Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. The low temperatures

and long trapping times now routinely achieved by these means have led to great advances

in precision spectroscopy and cold collision studies. These conditions also provide a suitable

starting point for evaporative cooling to Bose-Einstein condensation. However, traditional

laser cooling methods are easily applied only to atomic species that exhibit strong, closed

transitions at wavelengths accessible by current laser technology. Only ∼ 20 species have

been laser-cooled, mostly alkali and alkali-earth metals and the metastable states of noble

gases [1].

Two obstacles impede the further extension of laser cooling techniques. First, the lowest

energy transitions of many atoms of interest, including hydrogen and carbon, lie in the

vacuum ultraviolet (VUV). Not enough laser power is available in this spectral region to

drive eﬀective laser cooling. Second, the complex level structure of many atoms (and all

molecules) permits decay of an excited electron into a number of metastable levels widely

separated in energy. Each metastable decay channel must typically be repumped by a

separate laser, so the laser system becomes unwieldy.

Laser cooling of hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), and antihydrogen (H ) has remained

elusive owing to the ﬁrst obstacle, the lack of power available at the required 121 nm

VUV wavelength. Improved spectroscopy of the 1S – 2S two-photon transition at 243 nm

is the most obvious payoﬀ for laser cooling these atoms. The 1S – 2S transition plays a
unique role in metrology. Measurements of its frequency in H are accurate at the 10−14

level [2] and assist in determining the value of the Rydberg constant [3]. The isotope shift

of the 1S – 2S transition between H and D gives the most accurately determined value of

the D nuclear radius, tightly constraining nuclear structure calculations [4]. Possibly the

most exciting application is a comparison between H and H 1S – 2S frequencies, using the

low-energy H recently produced at CERN [5, 6]. Such comparisons can test CPT symmetry

to unprecedented accuracy, probing physics beyond the Standard Model [7, 8]. The H 1S –

2S measurement is currently limited by the ∼ 6 K temperature of the H beam and could be

improved by two orders of magnitude with colder atoms [2], e.g. in an atomic fountain [9].

The H formation temperature in the CERN experiments is likely to be of the same order,

limiting the corresponding H measurement.

2

Cooling of H below a few K currently requires direct contact with superﬂuid helium

[10, 11]. This method appears unlikely to work for H . Attempts to cool D in this way

have been unsuccessful because of the high binding energy of D on liquid helium [12]. Even

for H it is cumbersome, requiring a dilution refrigerator and a superconducting magnetic

trap, which severely restricts optical access. Current proposals for laser cooling H, D, and

H involve generation of Lyman α (121 nm) light for excitation of the 1S – 2P transition.

The small amount of light available means that cooling is extremely slow, on the timescale

of minutes in the only experiment reported so far [13].

Many atomic species of chemical and biological interest,

including carbon, nitrogen,

and oxygen, suﬀer from the second obstacle. These species have several valence electrons,

and are diﬃcult to laser-cool because of the many widely separated frequencies required

for repumping atomic dark states. On the other hand, spectroscopy on ultracold samples

of these atoms would greatly improve understanding of their long-range interactions and

chemical bonding behavior, similar to studies already performed for most alkalis (see [14]

for a recent review). Since these atoms display rich interactions and are common building

blocks of everyday objects, this kind of information can potentially impact many ﬁelds,

from biology to astrophysics. Simultaneous cooling of H and C could even lead to synthesis

of organic molecules at ultracold temperatures, as in current experiments that produce

ultracold molecules from laser-cooled alkali gases [15, 16].

We propose a laser cooling scheme that uses ultrafast pulse trains to address both

obstacles, opening many new atomic species to laser cooling. The ultrafast pulse trains

from mode-locked lasers exhibit high spectral resolution [17, 18, 19]. The high peak powers

of ultrafast pulses enable eﬃcient nonlinear optics far into the UV, greatly increasing the

time-averaged optical power available at short wavelengths [20, 21]. At the same time,

the many frequencies generated in short pulses can perform the function of repumping

lasers, reducing the complexity of laser systems for cooling atoms with multiple valence

electrons. Because of their high peak powers and high spectral resolution, ultrafast pulse

trains are much more eﬀective than single-frequency lasers for two-photon laser cooling.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our scheme for laser cooling H and H in currently used

3

magnetic traps, and discuss a potential cooling scenario for atomic carbon. An extension

of the scheme for laser cooling of molecules appears promising.

Laser cooling requires velocity-selective scattering to compress the atomic velocity distri-

bution. A pulse train from a mode-locked laser can have high spectral resolution, suﬃcient

to resolve atomic transitions at their natural linewidth [17, 18, 19]. As shown in Fig. 1, the

spectrum of such a pulse train is a comb of sharp lines with frequencies νk = νcar + kνrep,

where k is an integer, νcar is the optical carrier frequency, and νrep is the pulse repetition

rate.

If one comb line is nearly resonant with a Doppler-broadened atomic transition of

width ΓD, and νrep ≫ ΓD, the scattering rates induced by the neighboring comb lines are
reduced by a factor (ΓD/νrep)2. The rapid falloﬀ of scattering rate with detuning ensures

that, although there are many comb lines, the dominant contribution to the total scattering

rate comes from the single near-resonant comb line. Hence velocity-selective scattering

proceeds as for a CW laser and the Doppler cooling limit is hΓ/2, where Γ is the natural

width of the atomic transition. Velocity-selective scattering can also occur for νrep < Γ, if

the pulses are detuned by more than their bandwidth ∆ν from atomic resonance, but the

Doppler cooling limit is then h∆ν/2, corresponding to temperatures of a few K for pulse

durations of a few ps [22]. The related “white-light” cooling schemes use an additional CW

source near the atomic resonance to achieve temperatures ≪ h∆ν/2 [23, 24, 25], but this is

a diﬃcult requirement in the cases we will consider.

In most laser-cooling schemes, the eﬃciency of laser cooling depends critically on the

scattering rate, since a scattering event changes the atomic momentum, on average, by one

photon recoil. Fig. 2 compares single-photon and two-photon scattering for mode-locked

and CW excitation. For νrep ≫ Γ, the scattering rate on a single-photon transition is seen to

be a factor of νrep/∆ν smaller for mode-locked than for CW excitation, given equal average

laser intensity. Since a given laser can achieve approximately the same time-averaged power

whether it is operated CW or mode-locked, mode-locked excitation is less eﬃcient than CW

excitation for single-photon scattering. However, mode-locked and CW excitation can be

equally eﬃcient for two-photon scattering. A train of mutually coherent transform-limited

pulses with time-averaged intensity I ML induces a two-photon scattering rate S(2)(I ML)
approximately equal to the rate S(2)(ICW) induced by a CW laser of the same intensity

[26]. Roughly speaking, each pair of mode-locked comb lines induces a transition path,

and all pathways add coherently for transform-limited pulses. If the total average power

is divided equally among all comb lines, the transition rate becomes independent of the

number of comb lines.

In the ultraviolet, mode-locked laser systems oﬀer considerably

higher average powers than CW laser systems, so two-photon cooling rates can increase by

orders of magnitude over their CW values. This advantage makes two-photon mode-locked

cooling competitive with single-photon CW cooling in the cases studied below.

The high spectral resolution of ultrafast pulse trains and their eﬃcient excitation of

two-photon transitions suggest that one can use mode-locked lasers to perform laser cooling

on two-photon transitions when single-photon cooling is not possible. For the species H,

C, O, N, F, and Cl, the lowest-energy single-photon transitions are all blue of 170 nm,

precluding single-photon cooling, but these species also all exhibit two-photon transitions

red of 170 nm. Single-photon cooling is relatively ineﬀective for these species because

the available CW power is insuﬃcient. Continuous-wave light with MHz bandwidth at

. 170 nm has only been generated by four-wave mixing in atomic vapor [27]. This method

is highly technically challenging and yields only tens of nW of radiation. Two-photon

FIG. 2: Comparison of mode-locked and CW excitation of (a) single-photon and (b) two-photon

transitions using energy-level diagrams.

In (a), the frequency comb of the mode-locked laser

(black) has only one component resonant with the atomic transition, while all the CW light (red)

is resonant. In (b), we show a two-photon transition for which all intermediate states are far from

single-photon resonance. The mode-locked laser induces many transition paths whose amplitudes

add coherently, while the CW light follows only one path. The two-photon transition rates turn

out to be roughly equal for equal average power.

scattering of CW light is relatively weak, since the available power is usually tens of mW.

On the other hand, frequency conversion of ultrafast pulses can reach near-unit eﬃciency

from infrared to visible [20] and from visible to UV [21], so average powers of ∼ 1 W should

be achievable for wavelengths & 170 nm. Using ultrafast pulses increases the two-photon

scattering rate by a factor ∼ 104 over the CW case, simply owing to the higher nonlinear

conversion eﬃciency.

In particular, mode-locked laser cooling on the 1S – 2S two-photon transition at 243

nm is a good prospect for cooling magnetically trapped H, D, and H to Doppler-limited

temperatures of a few mK. A possible excitation scheme is shown in Fig. 3. While the

2S state is metastable, one can quench the 2S state to the 2P3/2 state using microwave

radiation near 10 GHz.

If the two-photon laser is tuned to the |F, mF i = |1, 1i – |1, 1i

component of the 1S – 2S transition and the quenching radiation is σ+-polarized, the atoms

are optically pumped to a stretched state and can remain magnetically trapped under laser

excitation. The upper limit to the usable two-photon intensity comes from one-photon

ionization of the excited state by 243 nm light. The photoionization rate from a given initial

state is the same for mode-locked and CW excitation; since the ﬁnal state is a continuum

with slowly varying matrix element, all comb lines contribute equally. The photoionization

Experiments on trapped hydrogen and antihydrogen would beneﬁt from our proposed

laser cooling technique. Proposed magnetic traps for antihydrogen [29, 30, 31] are similar

to those currently used for hydrogen, so we estimate typical laser cooling parameters for

both cases by considering the H trap apparatus used at MIT [10].

In that experiment,

cryogenically cooled H is loaded into a Ioﬀe-Pritchard magnetic trap, where up to 1013 H

atoms equilibrate to a temperature of 40 mK (set by trap depth) with peak number density
2 × 1013 cm−3 [32, 33]. From the magnetic trap parameters and the loading temperature,

we estimate the radius of the H sample as 2 mm and its length as 40 mm [10, 34]. A

quenching radiation power of 1.6 W with diﬀraction-limited focusing is suﬃcient to achieve

a 50 MHz Rabi frequency on the 2S1/2 – 2P3/2 transition. At a two-photon cooling intensity
of 60 kW cm−2, the resonant scattering rate is 1.0 kHz and the photoionization rate under

resonant two-photon excitation is 7 Hz. The sample geometry only allows us to achieve this
high intensity along the trap axis. The deceleration is 3.2 × 104 m s−2, and an atom can

generally be cooled to the one-dimensional Doppler limit in 8 ms if it stays in the cooling

light. With these parameters, only 5% of atoms will be lost to photoionization. The cooling

time is much shorter than the axial period of the trap, indicating that a transversely-guided

atomic beam could also be cooled by our technique.

The high UV powers from mode-locked pulse trains are essential to maintain such high

intensities over a reasonable area. Such light can be generated by frequency-doubling a

mode-locked Ti:S pulse train twice [20, 21], yielding average powers up to 1 W. Resonant

FIG. 3: Excitation scheme for laser cooling of magnetically trapped H or H . The 243 nm light

excites the atoms from the magnetically trapped 1S1/2 |F, mF i = |1, 1i state to the 2S1/2 |1, 1i

state. Radiation near 10 GHz quenches the metastable 2S state to the 2P3/2 |2, 2i state. The

atoms reradiate on the 1S1/2|1, 1i – 2P3/2|2, 2i transition at 121 nm, returning to the magnetically

trapped state. While in the 2S1/2 or 2P3/2 state, an atom can be photoionized by a single 243 nm

photon. For clarity, only the relevant 2P3/2 substate is shown.

enhancement cavities at 243 nm regularly achieve power buildup factors of 30 [35, 36], so the

waist radius of the cooling light can be 200 µm. For the MIT magnetic trap parameters, the
cooling light then overlaps 10−2 of the sample volume. As the sample cools, the spatial and

spectral overlap with the cooling light improves, but disregarding these factors we obtain

a one-dimensional Doppler cooling time for the whole sample of ∼ 20 s. Cross-dimensional

8

thermalization from atomic collisions should cool the entire sample to the 2.4 mK Doppler

limit in ∼ 60 s.

While this scheme is clearly less eﬃcient than laser cooling of alkali atoms, it is com-

petitive with other methods for laser-cooling H and H . Mode-locked two-photon cooling

compares well to cooling on the 121 nm 1S – 2P transition owing to the technical diﬃculties

of generating and manipulating 121 nm light. The ﬁrst 121 nm sources were developed over

20 years ago [37] and laser cooling of H at 121 nm was ﬁrst reported over 10 years ago [13],

but the highest 121 nm power reported is still only 20 nW [38]. Current proposals for 121

nm laser cooling expect resonant scattering rates less than 1 kHz for a 200 µm beam waist

[27, 39]. Mode-locked two-photon cooling also improves on CW two-photon cooling. Only

20 mW of 243 nm CW light is available [28, 35], so the resonant scattering rate would drop

to ∼ 1 Hz for CW two-photon cooling over the same beam waist.

Our cooling scheme opens up further possibilities for laser cooling of atomic species with

multiple valence electrons, which comprise most of the periodic table. These atoms often

have many low-lying metastable states that are coupled by spontaneous emission during

cooling. Eﬃcient cooling requires repeated velocity-selective excitation of all transitions,

so a narrowband radiation source must address each transition to avoid optical pumping

into a dark state. While this task requires many CW lasers, a single mode-locked laser

is suﬃcient. The octave-spanning laser oscillators currently available [40] can easily cover

the entire spectral range needed for excitation of all transitions. Although the transitions

are spaced more or less randomly with respect to the comb of frequencies generated by

the pulse train, the gaps between transition and laser frequencies are smaller than the

repetition rate and can easily be spanned by an electro-optic modulator driven at MHz to

GHz frequencies.

Such an RF-modulated pulse train might be used for laser cooling of carbon.

In

carbon, the wavelengths of the lowest dipole-allowed transitions lie blue of 170 nm, so

one-photon cooling is no easier than for hydrogen. There are six states in the ground 2s2 2p2

electronic conﬁguration, all having radiative lifetimes > 1 s and spanning an energy range
of 12000 cm−1. The ﬁve singlet and triplet ground states remain decoupled from the quintet

9

ground state under laser excitation, and one can avoid pumping into the 2s22p2 1S0 state

with a proper choice of cooling transitions. One-photon cooling thus would require four

vacuum UV lasers, a formidable technical challenge. However, carbon has many two-photon

transitions out of the ground-state manifold that can be excited with light in the 240 – 270

nm range [41], leading to the cooling cycle shown in Fig. 4. A single mode-locked laser

can easily achieve the bandwidth needed for cooling on all four transitions. Second-order
−2 cm4, orders
perturbation theory suggests transition rates of 10−3 to 10−5 I 2 Hz W

of magnitude higher than for hydrogen 1S – 2S, largely because of the relatively long

upper-state lifetimes for carbon (∼ 100 ns). The cooling cycle of Fig. 2 involves excited

states close to the ionization limit, for which excited-state photoionization can also be orders

of magnitude smaller than for hydrogen [42]. On the other hand, the recoil velocity and

radiative lifetime both decrease an order of magnitude as compared to hydrogen. Because

four transitions must be driven, the power available to drive each transition decreases

a factor of four, while the necessity for four unequally spaced laser frequencies makes

resonant enhancement of cooling power impractical. These advantages and disadvantages

roughly balance for realistic parameter values, so laser cooling of carbon also appears feasible.

The cases of hydrogen and carbon suggest that mode-locked two-photon excitation can

cool a variety of atomic species to temperatures ∼ 1 mK if the atoms are precooled to

a few hundred mK. Atomic and molecular gases have been cooled to these temperatures

by thermalization with helium buﬀer gas [43]. To obtain monatomic gases of refractory

elements like carbon, one typically uses a hollow cathode discharge beam [44] which

operates at high temperature. Buﬀer-gas cooling of such a beam, along the lines of [45],

provides a quite general precooling method for subsequent mode-locked two-photon cooling.

In this case, new atomic species might be cooled to mK temperatures without the need for

a complex and delicate superconducting magnetic trap.

Mode-locked two-photon excitation might also be useful in the laser cooling of trapped

molecules, where it oﬀers a route to ultracold temperatures without the loss of molecules

associated with evaporative cooling. A buﬀer-gas magnetic trap has conﬁned CaH at 400

mK [46], while ND3 has been trapped in static electric ﬁelds at temperatures up to 300 mK

[47, 48]. Laser cooling a typical molecule requires exciting tens or hundreds of rovibrational

levels, but some molecules have rovibrational structure that is relatively closed under

repeated scattering. Single-photon laser cooling in CaH, for instance, might require as few

as four cooling transitions [49], and comparably closed two-photon cycles might also be

identiﬁed for particular molecules. These cases seem amenable to cooling by RF-modulated

pulse trains, as suggested above for carbon. More generally, as the number of metastable

levels increases, the repetition rate of the laser must increase proportionately to keep all

transitions resolved. Although cooling with a RF-modulated pulse train becomes ineﬀective

in this case, Raman scattering in a molecular vapor can add sidebands to the cooling light

that independently address the molecular rovibrational levels [50].

We have presented a new method of laser cooling based on two-photon excitation

with ultrafast pulse trains. Pulse trains can provide the velocity selection necessary

11

for laser cooling, and mode-locked light excites two-photon transitions as eﬃciently as

CW laser light of the same average intensity. Frequency conversion is more eﬃcient for

ultrafast pulses, giving them an advantage for two-photon laser cooling of atoms whose

lowest-energy single-photon transitions lie in the vacuum UV, such as H and H .

It

also seems possible to cool multielectron atoms, for instance carbon, by modulating a

single pulse train at radio frequencies. In combination with buﬀer-gas precooling [43, 45],

this method oﬀers the chance to produce mK samples of a variety of new atomic species.

The application of similar techniques to laser cooling of molecules is a tantalizing possibility.

Based on a three-potential formalism we propose mathematically well-behaved equations for the
atomic three-body problem. The integral equations can successfully be solved in Coulomb-Sturmian
space representation. The power of the method is demonstrated in benchmark bound-state calcula-
tions.

The Faddeev equations are the fundamental equations
of the three-body problems. Besides giving a uniﬁed for-
mulation, they are superior to variational methods in
many respects:
in incorporating the boundary condi-
tions, in treating the symmetries, in handling the cor-
relations etc. Nevertheless, their use in atomic three-
body calculations is rather scarce and in all successful
atomic Faddeev calculations diﬀerential equations are
solved [1,2]. Diﬀerential equations, however, require
boundary conditions which, for three-body Coulombic
systems, are not known for all possible dynamical situa-
tions. It would thus be preferable use integral equations
instead.

The aim of this letter is to set up mathematically well-
behaved integral equations for atomic three-body prob-
lems by invoking a newly established “three-potential”
formalism. This formalism was designed for solving nu-
clear three-body problems in the presence of Coulomb
interaction. The method was presented ﬁrst in bound-
sate calculations [3] and was extended to below-breakup
scattering calculations [4] where the notion of the “three-
potential” formalism was also introduced.
In this so-
lution to the nuclear three-body problem, in the spirit
of the two-potential formalism, all long-range interac-
tions, i.e. all Coulomb interactions, are put, `a la No-
ble [5], into the “free” Green’s operator. Invoking again
the two-potential formalism, the incalculable Faddeev-
Noble Green’s operator was linked to Bencze’s channel
distorted Green’s operator [6]. The “three-potential”
formalism, thus consists of repeated applications of the
two-potential formalism, and results in integral equations
which contain only short-range interactions as source
terms. So, the formalism yields mathematically well-
behaved integral equations and they were successfully
solved in Coulomb-Sturmian (CS) space representation.
Below we outline the “three-potential” formalism for
atomic systems. Then the solution of the integral equa-
tions is described. Finally, as a compulsory benchmark
case, we calculate the He atom.

β + vC
γ ,

H = H 0 + vC

The Hamiltonian of an atomic three-body system reads
α + vC
where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and
vC
α denotes the Coulomb interaction in subsystem α. We
introduce here the usual conﬁguration-space Jacobi co-
ordinates ~ξα and ~ηα; ~ξα is the vector connecting the pair
(β, γ) and ~ηα is the vector connecting the center of mass
of the pair (β, γ) and the particle α. Thus vC
α only de-
pends on ξα, i.e. vC

α = vC

α (ξα).

(1)

The peculiarity of Hamiltonian (1) is that all poten-
tials are of long-range type. However, the physical role
of the Coulomb potential is twofold.
Its long-distance
part modiﬁes the asymptotic motion, while its short-
range part strongly correlate the two-body subsystems.
So, we may split the Coulomb potential as a sum of long-
range and short-range terms,

(3)

(4)

(6)

(7)

(8)

vC = v(l) + v(s).

(2)

Short-range and long-range interactions play entirely
diﬀerent roles in integral equations. While short-range
interactions contribute to the source terms, long-range
interactions should always be put into the Green’s op-
erator. Following Faddeev’s procedure [7], we split the
wave function into three components,

|Ψi = |ψαi + |ψβi + |ψγi,

and, for the components, we arrive at the modiﬁed Fad-
deev equations

|ψαi = G(l)

α (E)[v(s)

α |ψβi + v(s)

α |ψγi],

with a cyclic permutation for α, β, γ. The Green’s oper-
ator is deﬁned as

G(l)

α (z) = (z − H 0 − v(l)
= (z − H 0 − vC

α − v(l)
α − v(l)

β − v(l)
β − v(l)
γ )

γ − v(s)
α )
−1.

(5)

In the spirit of the “three-potential” formalism, we relate
this Green’s operator to a simpler Green’s operator via
the resolvent relation

G(l)

α (z) =

Gα(z) +

Gα(z)U αG(l)

with

Gα(z) and U α deﬁned by

and

e

U α = v(l)

β + v(l)

respectively. Here we have introduced the auxiliary po-
tential uC
α which is acting in coordinate ηα and is required
to have the asymptotic form

uC
α (ηα) ∼ Zα(Zβ + Zγ)/ηα

as ηα → ∞.

(9)

In fact, it is an eﬀective long-range interaction between
the center of mass of the subsystem α (with charge
Zβ + Zγ) and the third particle (with charge Zα). The
importance of uC
α lies in the fact that it asymptotically
compensates the long-range potentials v(l)
in Eq.
(6). So, as regards the asymptotic motion, U α is of short-
range type. Both in Eq. (4) and in Eq. (6), which con-
stitute the basic integral equations of the atomic three-
body problem mediated by the “three-potential” formal-
ism, only short-range type interactions are appearing as
source terms, thus the equations are mathematically well
behaved. They, similarly to the nuclear Coulomb three-
body problem [3,4], can be solved in CS-space represen-
tation.

where n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., L represents the Laguerre poly-

nli = hr|nli/r they form a biorthonormal basis.
Since the three-body Hilbert space is a direct sum of
e
two-body Hilbert spaces, the appropriate basis in angular
momentum representation may be deﬁned as a the direct
product

|nνlλiα = [|nliα ⊗ |νλiα]L,

(n, ν = 0, 1, 2, . . .),

(11)

with the CS states of Eq. (10). Here l and λ denote the
relative angular momenta of the two-body pair (β, γ) and
of the third particle α relative to the center of mass of the
pair, respectively, and they are coupled to the total angu-
lar momentum L. Now the completeness relation takes
the form (with angular momentum summation implicitly
included)

Notice that the matrix elements of the Green’s opera-
tor, which contains all long-range terms, are needed only
between the same partition α whereas the matrix ele-
ments of the short range potentials occur only between
diﬀerent partitions α and β. The latter can be evalu-
ated numerically by making use of the transformation of
Jacobi coordinates [9].

The matrix elements (17) can be obtained by solving
the Eq. (6), which is, in fact, a two-body multichannel
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. If we perform again the
separable approximation on potential U α, with the help
of the formal solution of Eq. (6) we may now express the
inverse matrix (G(l)

this work, bipolar coordinates. To overcome the poor
convergence in bipolar coordinates, the solution of the
Faddeev equations in total angular momentum represen-
tation was proposed [2], which, however, results in three-
dimensional instead of two dimensional equations. In the
light of our results, this seems to be superﬂuous, since the
poor convergence is a consequence of the ill-behavior of
the applied form of the Faddeev equations.

We have proposed a set of Faddeev and Lippmann-
Schwinger equations for atomic three-body systems us-
ing the newly established “three-potential” formalism.
The Coulomb interactions were split into long-range and
short-range terms and the Faddeev procedure was ap-
plied only to the short-range potentials. The resulting
modiﬁed Faddeev equations are mathematically well be-
haved since the source terms are of short-range type and
all the long-range interactions are kept in the Green’s
operator. This Green’s operator was calculated from the
channel distorted Green’s operator via two-body mul-
tichannel Lippmann-Schwinger equations whose kernels
are also of short-range type thus ensuring the good math-
ematical behavior of the equations. Because the channel
distorted Green’s operator appears as a resolvent of the
sum of two commuting two-body Hamiltonians, it can be
represented as a convolution integral of the correspond-
ing two-body Green’s operators.

The set of Faddeev and Lippmann-Schwinger equa-
tions were solved in the Coulomb-Sturmian space rep-
resentation. The use of this representation is essential
as it allows an analytic representation of the two-body
Coulomb Green’s operator on the complex energy plane,
which makes straightforward the calculation of the con-
volution integral and the incorporation of the inﬁnitely
many bound states in an attractive Coulomb interaction.
We have found a rapid convergence with respect to en-
larging the representation-space by taking higher terms
in CS expansion or by taking into account higher angu-
lar momentum channels. In fact, the convergence is by
no means worse than what we have seen in the case of
nuclear potentials without and with the Coulomb interac-
tion. This underlines again the advantage of mathemati-
cally well-behaved integral equations. However, their real
advantage should come in scattering state calculations.
The extension of this formalism to below-breakup scat-
tering calculations is analogous to the nuclear Coulomb
case [4]. The most interesting consequence of the good
behavior of the integral equations is that the scope of
the present method can probably be extended to above-
breakup calculations.

This work has been supported by OTKA under Con-

tracts No. T17298 and T020409.

Here the contour C should go, in counterclockwise direc-
tion, around the continuous and discrete spectrum of hC
ξα
in such a way that the resolvent of hC
ηα is analytic in the
domain encircled by C [cf. Fig. 1]. This condition can
only be fulﬁlled if the auxiliary potential uC
α is deﬁned
in such a way that the discrete spectrum of hC
ηα does not
overlap with the continuous spectrum of hC
ξα. The matrix
elements (20) can thus be cast into the form

where both matrix elements occurring in the integrand
are known from the two-particle case (see [11,3]).

To demonstrate the eﬃciency of the method we cal-
culate the ground state of the helium atom. As cut-oﬀ
functions we use the square of the exceptionally smooth
error functions and deﬁne the auxiliary potentials as:

α (ξα) = [erf(ωαξα)]2vC

Before presenting the ﬁnal results, let us demonstrate
the convergence of the three-body energy with increasing
N , the number of terms in the expansion of the short-
range potential v(s) (cf. Eq. (15)). In Table I we present
results for the binding energy (in atomic units) taking
into account angular momentum states up to l = 0, l = 2,
l = 4 and l = 6. In all cases we can observe that, simi-
larly to what we have experienced with nuclear potentials
without and with Coulomb interaction [3], convergence
up to six signiﬁcant digits is comfortably achieved with
terms up to N = 19 applied for n and ν. The converged
results do not depend on parameter b and for a wide
range of reasonable values, even the speed of the conver-
gence is rather insensitive to the choice of b. Here we
have taken b = 3.75 in all Jacobi coordinates and used
ω = 0.8 throughout.

Table II shows the convergence of the partial wave ex-
pansion at diﬀerent ω cut-oﬀ parameters. We can see
that with an appropriate choice of ω, a rapid conver-
gence is reached in the partial wave expansion. The speed
of convergence is comparable with what we have experi-
enced with nuclear potentials without and with Coulomb
interaction [3], and is much faster then in earlier works
[1]. There the conﬁguration-space Faddeev diﬀerential
equations were solved for atomic systems using, like in

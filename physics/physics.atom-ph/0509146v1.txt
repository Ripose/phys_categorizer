Scattering parameters for cold Li-Rb and Na-Rb collisions derived from variable
phase theory

H. Ouerdane and M.J. Jamieson∗
Department of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, 17 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK

We show how the scattering phase shift, the s-wave scattering length and the p-wave scattering
volume can be obtained from Riccati equations derived in variable phase theory. We ﬁnd general
expressions that provide upper and lower bounds for the scattering length and the scattering volume.
We show how, in the framework of the variable phase method, Levinson’s theorem yields the number
of bound states supported by a potential. We report new results from a study of the heteronuclear
alkali dimers NaRb and LiRb. We consider ab initio molecular potentials for the X1Σ+ and a3Σ+
states of both dimers and compare and discuss results obtained from experimentally based X1Σ+
and a3Σ+ potentials of NaRb. We explore the mass dependence of the scattering data by considering
all isotopomers and we calculate the numbers of bound states supported by the molecular potentials
for each isotopomer.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the properties of ultra-cold trapped en-
sembles of atoms requires a description of very slow
atomic collisions. The scattering length is a crucial quan-
tity in the study of Bose-Einstein condensation. While
there has been much interest in the behaviour of ultra-
cold monatomic alkali gases, recent successes in the pro-
duction of Bose-Fermi ensembles of various heteronuclear
alkali dimers [1, 2, 3] and dual species Bose-Einstein
condensates [4] have created further interest in studies
of binary mixtures. Scattering of heteronuclear atoms
at ultra-low temperature is characterised by the s-wave
scattering length, as, the eﬀective range, Reﬀ , and the p-
wave scattering volume, ap, the contributions from higher
angular momenta being negligible at very low energy
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. There is a need for the values of the
scattering lengths and scattering volumes.

In this paper we make use of the variable phase ap-
proach to potential scattering [10] to calculate the scat-
tering data as and ap. This method is convenient and
to some extent superior to the traditional calculation

phase method one solves a ﬁrst-order nonlinear diﬀeren-
tial equation, the phase equation, of the Riccati type,
whose solution in the asymptotic region provides the
phase shift directly. As we show below, the phase equa-
tion is simple to manipulate in deriving properties of the
scattering.

We have shown how to use the variable phase method
to compute the s-wave scattering length of a pair of col-

liding atoms [11]. We derived corrections arising from
the long range interaction, accurate to at least ﬁrst or-
der in the interaction strength, and we provided upper
and lower bounds to the scattering length. Use of the
corrections signiﬁcantly accelerates the convergence, as
R → ∞, to the desired scattering length, a, of a quantity
a(R) that is the scattering length accumulated at separa-
tion R. Here we extend our previous work to any angular
momentum. Our analysis is consistent with the exten-
sion of the technique introduced for s-waves by Marinescu
[12]. While we suggest that the the Riccati equation be
solved directly, our corrections can also be applied to
scattering parameters obtained from explicit computa-
tion of the wavefunction.

The variable phase method was demonstrated for s-
waves [11] for the model potential described in reference
[13]. Here we compute the s-wave scattering lengths and
p-wave scattering volumes for the heteronuclear dimers
NaRb and LiRb. We use ab initio molecular potentials
for the two states X1Σ+ and a3Σ+ [14], as well as the
latest X1Σ+ and a3Σ+ NaRb potentials based on exper-
imental data [15, 16]. A diﬃcult problem in the accu-
rate determination of the scattering length arises from
the quality of the interatomic potential. If the potential
is not accurately known then it is possible that, within
its error bounds, it supports a zero-energy bound state
which makes the computed scattering length extremely
sensitive to any change in the potential. Our results, ob-
tained with the above potentials, are compared to other
recent calculations [17].

We calculate the number of bound states supported by
those potentials using the simplest formulation of Levin-
son’s theorem [10, 18], linking the scattering phase shift,
δk,l, to the number of bound states, Nb, via Nbπ =
δk,l|k=0 where k is the wavenumber of the relative motion.
The scattering phase shift may be computed from the
phase equation of variable phase theory with no mod[π]
ambiguity.

This paper is organised as follows.

In section 2 we
present our mathematical model, recall results from vari-

able phase theory [10, 19], give detail of our derivations

coupled to Eq. (3) with l = 0, is not amenable to numer-
ical solution because of the poles that it contains; the
variable phase method is not suitable for numerical cal-
culation of the eﬀective range but it can be used to ﬁnd
long range corrections to it.

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL

A. The phase equation

The traditional method to compute the scattering
phase shift, δk,l, where the angular momentum in terms
of the rationalised Planck’s constant ¯h is l¯h, needs the
solution of the Schr¨odinger equation at large separation.
In the variable phase approach [10] the phase shift is ob-
tained directly from the accumulated phase, δk,l(R) [10].
The accumulated s-wave phase satisﬁes the equation

d
dR

δk,0(R) = −k

−1V (R) sin2 [kR + δk,0(R)] ,

(1)

where V (R) = 2µV(R)/¯h2, V(R) being the interaction
potential and µ the reduced mass. The phase shift is the
limit of the accumulated phase as R → ∞; it suﬀers no
mod[π] ambiguity.

C. Corrections to the calculated scattering
parameters

The function al(R) converges rather slowly with in-
creasing separation, R. We need the value at inﬁnite
interatomic separation, al(∞). In practice we must stop
the numerical calculation of the solution of Eq. (3) at a
ﬁnite value, Rc, of R. Computation time and accumu-
lated truncation error can be large because Rc must be
chosen to be suﬃciently large that the long range part
of the interatomic potential has neglible eﬀect at sepa-
rations greater than Rc. Adopting the same analysis as
in our previous work [11] we extend our calculations to
any value of the angular momentum l¯h and show how the
Riccati equation, Eq. (3), can be used to derive correc-
tions to be applied to the calculated scattering parame-
ters, that compensate for stopping the calculation at the
ﬁnite distance Rc.

We need the contribution of the long range interaction
over the range [Rc, ∞]. The presentation is simpler in
terms of dimensionless quantities. With the substitution

B. Low-energy scattering

At angular momentum l¯h the tangent of the phase
δk,l(r) can be expressed in eﬀective range theory by

with 0!! = 1 = 1!!. The accumulated phase, δk,l(R), is
the phase shift that would be determined for a poten-
tial truncated at ﬁnite separation, R, and hence Eq. (2),
which applies strictly for scattering by a short range po-
tential, is valid.

We are interested in the coeﬃcients al(R). For l = 0
and l = 1, and R → ∞, these coeﬃcients are the s-
wave scattering length, as, and the p-wave scattering vol-
ume, ap, respectively. Similar equations can be found for
bl(R). In the asymptotic region the coeﬃcient b0(R) is
related to the eﬀective range, Reﬀ , via b0(∞) = a2
s Reﬀ/2.
Unfortunately the equation satisﬁed by b0(R), which is

Eq. (6) has the same form as Eq. (3) of Ref. [11] with
Fl(Z) in place of V(R). Hence, from Ref. [11], we ﬁnd
that for an attractive dispersion potential and suﬃciently
large Rc, upper and eﬀective lower bounds, ˜a(U)
and ˜a(L)
respectively, are given by

G. Advantages of the variable phase method

We have seen that the scattering parameter al can be
evaluated by ﬁnding al,c (= al(Rc)) by propagating the
solution of the ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation, Eq. (3), to
a suitable interatomic separation Rc and then applying
the correction of Eqs. (8) and (9). The variable phase
method yields a simple derivation of these corrections.
The corrections can also be applied to the value of al,c
obtained by any other suitable method.

An advantage of the variable phase method over the
traditional method is that one needs to solve a diﬀeren-
tial equation only once. In the traditional method one
must solve a diﬀerential equation several times at dif-
ferent small wavenumbers, extract the phase shifts from
the asymptotic solutions, and use the extrapolation of
Eq. (2). Some experimentation is needed when choosing
suitable wavenumbers.

An alternative to this method described above is to
solve the zero energy Eq. (16) and extract the parameter
al from its solution by Eq. (19), as was done by Mari-
nescu [12] for a0. Here and in the variable phase method
one must solve one diﬀerential equation once. However,
because of rapid variation of the local wave number over
the potential well a variable step of integration should be
used to economise on computation and minimise accu-
mulated truncation error. Adaptive methods, that select
the step automatically, are well established for ﬁrst or-
der equations such as Eq. (29), derived from Eq. (3).
Eq. (16) is a second order equation. Automatic step con-
trol is not so well developed for second order equations as
for ﬁrst order one and in using numerical methods such
as that of Numerov, the step and points at which it is
to be changed must be inserted explicitly. Thus the vari-
able phase method is also advantageous over the method
based on the zero energy equation.

It should be noted that the log-derivative method of
solving the variable phase Eq. (3) [11] does not have an
advantage over the Numerov method for solving the zero
energy equation; the considerations concerning explicit
insertion of the step apply to both and also to the tradi-
tional method described above.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR NaRb AND
LiRb

A. The molecular potentials

We compute scattering parameters for LiRb and
NaRb. We use various potentials and compare and dis-
cuss results. Korek et al. [14] calculated ab initio molec-
ular potentials for the X1Σ+ and a3Σ+ states of LiRb
[16] constructed an X1Σ+
and NaRb. Docenko et al.
NaRb potential from experimental data and from the
a3Σ+ state potential made by Zemke et al.
In
the long range dispersion potentials we used the van der
Waals coeﬃcients computed by Derevianko et al. [26, 27]
with C6 from Ref. [26] and C8 and C10 from Ref. [27].

[15].

There is diﬃculty in matching an analytic long range
potential to the short range part which is usually avail-
able only in tabulated form. Any artiﬁcial discontinuity
at the matching point can greatly aﬀect the calculated
scattering data. For LiRb the matching point that gives
the smoothest ﬁt is at a separation of 40 bohr. We found
that within the precision of the data of Korek et al. [14]
the singlet and triplet potentials do not diﬀer beyond 30
bohr and hence we neglected exchange beyond the match-
ing point at 40 bohr, which is outside the typical LeRoy
radius [28] of 10-15 ˚A of alkali dimers. For NaRb we
used the short range potentials of Korek et al. [14] and
matched at 30 bohr to the long range dispersion form
evaluated with the dispersion coeﬃcients of Derevianko
et al. [26, 27].

The computed scattering parameters crucially depend
on the potential. It is important to compare results ob-
tained with various molecular potentials. The most re-
cent short range LiRb potential is that of Korek et al.
[14]. However Docenko et al.
[16] provided new mea-
surements pertinent to the X1Σ+ molecular state of the
NaRb molecule and Zemke et al. [15] also made calcula-
tions for the a3Σ+ state of the NaRb molecule. We use
calculations with these potentials in a comparison with
the recent results of Weiss et al. [17].

We include exchange explicitly only for the a3Σ+ state
of the NaRb molecule for which the point for matching
to the long range potential is within the LeRoy radius.
We represent exchange by the expression of Smirnov and
Chibisov [29] in the formulation given by Weiss et al [17].

B. Numerical results

We tabulate the calculated scattering length data, as
and ap, and the numbers of bound states, Nb, supported
by the molecular potentials. The values are those ob-
tained from the analyses above including corrections for
ap, those that we obtained from our previous analyses
for as [11] and those obtained from Levinson’s theorem
applied to the solution of Eq. (1) for Nb. We compare
our results with those for NaRb of Weiss et al. [17].

1. Study of LiRb

We used the following values for the masses of
the isotopes, all in atomic mass, units obtained from
Institute of Standards and Technol-
the National
ogy (NIST): M6Li = 6.0151223, M7Li = 7.016004,
M85Rb = 84.9117893 and M87Rb = 86.9091835. For
the singlet state X1Σ+ we see that the nature of the
isotopomer inﬂuences the value of the scattering length
and its sign; the scattering length is positive for the
smaller mass and negative for the bigger mass. However
a change in the Rb mass changes the value of the scat-
tering length but not its sign. The order of magnitude
of the various values of the scattering length does not
change. The greater inﬂuence of mass changes of Li
compared to Rb is caused by the greater sensitivity of
the reduced mass of the dimer to changes in the mass of
the lighter atom. The scattering volume is more stable
with its sign remaining unchanged and its values having
the same order of magnitude and is less sensitive to
a change of the masses of the atoms. The number of
bound states is sensitive to the Li mass.

The a3Σ+ potential well is much shallower than the
X1Σ+ well. Therefore the value of the reduced mass of
the LiRb molecule does not dramatically aﬀect the scat-
tering length (although it becomes slightly negative for
the heaviest isotopomer). The scattering volume keeps
its sign and there is a change of only one bound state
when the LiRb dimer is composed of either of the Rb iso-
topes and the heavier of the Li isotopes. However there
is a qualitatively opposite behaviour in the changes of ap
when the mass of Li is greater as compared with the re-
sults obtained for the X1Σ+ state; the scattering volume
is greater in magnitude for the smaller values of the mass
of Li in the X1Σ+ state and smaller for the greater value
of the mass of Li in the a3Σ+ state.

The semiclassical analysis of Gribakin and Flambaum
[13] can be invoked to explain the variation of scattering

length with mass. The semiclassical scattering length
depends only on the action integral which, for a given
potential, is proportional to the square root of the re-
duced mass. The semiclassical formulas for the scattering
length and the number of bound states, combined with
the dispersion parameters of the potential and the com-
puted scattering length, allow us to ﬁnd the action inte-
gral appropriate to our quantum calculations. The action
integral divided by the square root of the reduced mass
thus calculated should be independent of isotopomer.
This quantity obtained from our quantal results varies
by less than 2% over the range of LiRb isotopomers con-
sidered, which is consistent with semiclassical theory. It
has the values 1.6 and 0.49 atomic units for the X1Σ+
and the a3Σ+ potentials respectively.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the convergence of the ap-
proximations to the scattering parameters. Figure 3
shows the accumulated phase shift, demonstrating how
it is related to the number of bound states.

New ab initio or spectroscopically determined LiRb
molecular potentials for the X1Σ+ and a3Σ+ states will
be extremely useful to allow comparison of the results
displayed in Table I and hence to conﬁrm the physical
implications of the signs of the scattering parameters,
and the numbers of bound states. This is important for
NaRb; when we compare values of as, ap and Nb com-
puted from three diﬀerent potentials for each molecular
state we ﬁnd discrepancies.

2. Study of NaRb

We took the value for the mass of 23Na given by NIST
as 22.98976967 atomic mass units. There are two iso-
topomers.

Our results, displayed in Table II, computed with the
X1Σ+ potential of Docenko et al.
[16] are in excellent
agreement with those of Weiss et al. [17] for 23Na85Rb.
Weiss et al.
[17] claimed that for NaRb the ab initio

potentials of Korek et al.
[14] may not be appropriate
for the calculation of scattering lengths as they do not
agree with the potentials determined from spectroscopic
measurments.

The values of as and ap depend again on the mass of
the molecule. However the number of bound states is not
inﬂuenced by the choice of NaRb isotopomer because the
Rb isotopes diﬀer little in mass. The sign of the scatter-
ing length is not inﬂuenced by the choice of NaRb iso-
topomer for the singlet potential but, for the triplet state,
there is a qualitative diﬀerence between the results com-
puted from the potential of Korek et al.
[14] (negative
scattering length) and those obtained from the potentials
of Weiss et al. [17] and of Zemke et al. [15] (positive scat-
tering lengths). The numbers of bound states computed
from potentials in Refs. [15, 16] and [17] agree whereas
we ﬁnd fewer bound states supported by both triplet and
singlet potentials of Ref. [14]. This explains the change
of sign of the scattering length.

We compare the scattering volumes computed from the
potentials of Korek et al. [14] with those computed from
the potentials of Zemke et al.
[15]. A striking diﬀer-
ence is the opposite signs for both singlet potentials. In

for LiRb we found that the action integral divided by
the square root of the reduced mass obtained from our
quantal results varies by less than 1
3 % for the NaRb iso-
topomers considered. In atomic units it has the values
1.4 and 0.32 for the X1Σ+ and the a3Σ+ potentials of
Korek et al. [14] respectively, the values 1.5 and 0.39 for
the X1Σ+ and the a3Σ+ potentials of Zemke et al. [15]
respectively and the value 1.5 for the X1Σ+ potential of
Docenko et al. [16].

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown that the variable phase method is ap-
propriate for the study of very slow atomic collisions as
it allows direct calculation of scattering parameters and
the number of bound states. The method is convenient.
It let us derive corrections that form upper and lower
bounds for as and ap. The corrections are simple and we
suggest that use of the ﬁrst-order correction with a mod-
erate value of Rc is suﬃcient to evaluate as and ap. We
demonstrated the simplicity and eﬃciency of the phase
method with our study of Li-Rb and Na-Rb collisions,
and we reported new scattering data for these systems.

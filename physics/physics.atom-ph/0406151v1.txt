Abstract

An improved system for creating a pulsed, low-temperature molecular beam of OH
radicals has been developed. We use a pulsed discharge to create OH from H2O
seeded in Xe during a supersonic expansion, where the high-voltage pulse duration
is signiﬁcantly shorter than the width of the gas pulse. The pulsed discharge allows
for control of the mean speed of the molecular packet as well as maintains a low
temperature supersonic expansion. A hot ﬁlament is placed in the source chamber
to initiate the discharge for shorter durations and at lower voltages, resulting in a
translationally and rotationally colder packet of OH molecules.

1 Introduction

The hydroxyl radical (OH) is important in many diverse ﬁelds of science, in-
cluding ultracold collisional physics [1,2], physical chemistry [3,4], astrophysics
[5,6], atmospheric physics [7], and combustion science. Laboratory studies of
OH molecules require a controlled and a well-characterized source of the rad-
icals. However, because of their highly reactive nature, a controllable source
is diﬃcult to generate in the laboratory. We present a controllable discharge-
based system to create a cold pulsed beam of OH molecules.

There are several diﬀerent techniques to produce a molecular beam of OH
radicals. The four main methods for creating OH molecules are photolysis [8,9],
radio-frequency discharge [10], DC discharge [11,12], and chemical reactions

[13]. We chose DC discharge because, of all of the methods, it is the simplest
and most cost-eﬀective technique. As presented below, the system we have
developed also fulﬁlls the goal of producing a large sample of cold molecules
with a high phase-space density. We report several key improvements to the
standard DC discharge system, including a pulsed high-voltage discharge to
reduce heating of the molecular packet and to allow for control of the mean
speed of the molecular packet. Also the introduction of a hot ﬁlament into
the source chamber allows the discharge to operate more stably and at a
lower voltage, thus reducing the heating of the OH molecules during their
production. Through controlled application of a high voltage discharge pulse,
we are able to create packets of OH molecules at reasonable densities that vary
in mean speed from 265 to 470 m/s with full-width half-maximum (FWHM)
velocity spread as low as 16%.

In this Letter we describe the components of our OH source as well as the
detailed characterization of the molecular beam. Our particular motivation
for creating a cold beam of OH molecules is to use the beam as an input to a
Stark-eﬀect based molecular decelerator. A Stark decelerator is an apparatus
that takes advantage of the Stark energy shift, such as in the 2Π3/2 (J = 3/2)
state in OH, to slow the mean longitudinal velocity of a molecular packet to
near zero via interactions with inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds [14,15,16,17].

2 Experimental

A diagram of the experimental apparatus and discharge assembly is shown in
Fig. 1. The vacuum system consists of two chambers separated by a mechan-
ical skimmer, which maintains a diﬀerential pressure between the chambers.
During operation the source (hexapole) chamber is at a pressure of 4 ×10−4
torr (1 ×10−6 torr)(1 torr = 133 Pa). A current loop actuated valve, com-
mercially available from R. M. Jordan Company Inc. [18], operates at 5 Hz
to create a gas pulse ∼ 100 µs long. Directly in front of the 0.5 mm diameter
valve nozzle is a set of stainless steel disc electrodes, electrically isolated from
one another as well as from the valve body by Boron nitride spacers. The
relevant dimensions are shown in Fig. 1. The electrode closest to the valve has
a 0.5 mm diameter hole to match the valve nozzle. The downstream electrode
has an inner diameter of 4 mm to allow the gas to expand as it travels between
the electrodes. The valve nozzle is placed ∼ 8 cm away from the downstream
wall of the vacuum chamber to ensure carrier gas atoms scattered from the
wall do not interfere with the supersonic expansion and beam propagation.

In the second chamber, a 13 cm long electric focusing hexapole is centered
along the beam path. The hexapole is used as a tool to determine the trans-
verse velocity spread of the molecular beam. The hexapole is formed by six,

mm in diameter and set at every 60◦ at a center-to-center radius of 4.6 mm.
Alternate rods are charged to equal magnitude but opposite polarity high
voltage.

The experimental procedure begins with the pulsed valve opening for ∼100µs,
thus creating a supersonically cooled pulse of Xenon (Xe) carrier gas seeded
with a few percent water. The typical backing pressure of Xe is three at-
mospheres. Xe is used instead of a lighter noble gas because of the resulting
lower mean speed of the molecular beam, which is advantageous for our Stark-
decelerator application. At a variable time after the valve opens, a high-voltage
pulse is applied to the disc electrodes. The duration of the high-voltage pulse
can be varied from 1 to 200 µs. A discharge duration greater than 150 µs is
considered to be essentially DC because the discharge duration is longer than
the gas pulse. The polarity of the voltage applied is such that electrons are
accelerated against the molecular beam propagation direction, which results
in a more stable discharge than the opposite polarity. During the discharge
operation, 6 A of DC current is passed though a tungsten ﬁlament, which is
located inside the source chamber. The products created by the ﬁlament help
to initiate a stable discharge at lower electrode voltages and shorter discharge
pulse durations, ultimately leading to a colder molecular beam.

After the OH molecules are produced in the discharge, they are allowed to
ﬂy to one of two detection regions, which are illustrated by black circles in
Fig. 1. The density of OH molecules in the detection region is determined by

3

laser-induced ﬂuoresces (LIF). The OH molecules are excited by a frequency-
doubled pulsed dye laser on the A2Σ1/2(v = 1) ←X2Π3/2(v = 0) transition at
282 nm. The ﬂuorescence from the A2Σ1/2(v = 1) →X2Π3/2(v = 1) transition
at 313 nm (with a lifetime of 750 ns) is then imaged onto a gated photomulti-
plier tube (PMT). An interference ﬁlter is placed in front of the PMT to reduce
the transmission of the excitation laser photons by > 103, while still allowing
15% of the ﬂuorescence photons to pass. This spectral discrimination, along
with careful spatial ﬁltering and imaging, greatly reduces the background sig-
nal from scattered laser light. The signal from the PMT is averaged 300 times
and integrated over a 3 µs time window on a digital oscilloscope. The time
from the discharge to the detection is varied to obtain a time-of-ﬂight (TOF)
proﬁle of the OH molecular packet (see Fig.2a).

3 Results

3.1 Pulsed discharge

Creating OH using a high-voltage discharge pulse shorter than the gas pulse
signiﬁcantly reduces the translational and the rotational temperature, as well
as permits control of the mean speed of the OH packet. We would like to
point out that our pulsed system is distinctly diﬀerent than the one presented
in [12], where the discharge pulse duration is 2.5 ms, much longer than the
actual gas pulse. In our system the applied voltage between the discharging
disc electrodes is controlled by a high-voltage MOSFET switch produced by
Behlke Electronics GmbH [18]. This device can switch up to 5 kV in well under
1 µs. Using this switch to pulse the discharging voltage, the velocity spread of
the OH molecular packet is greatly reduced. The TOF proﬁles in Fig. 2a show
a dramatic narrowing of the longitudinal velocity distribution by reducing the
duration of the discharge pulse from DC to 2 µs. Also the measured rotational
temperature of the OH beam decreases from 195 K to 28 K. The voltage on the
electrodes is increased from 1.4 kV, for the short discharge duration, to 1.9 kV
for the DC case. For a DC discharge, very few OH molecules are produced at
1.4 kV. To make a reasonable comparison between the two modes of operation,
we increased the voltage for the DC case until the peak signal of the OH packet
was approximately equal to that of the short discharge duration case. When
the discharge is allowed to occur during the entire gas pulse, there is a large
amount of heating from the violent discharge process. Thus shortening the
discharge pulse duration greatly reduces the temperature of the OH molecular
packet and signiﬁcantly increases the molecular phase-space density.

A short discharge pulse duration also gives the freedom to produce OH molecules
at diﬀerent stages during the supersonic expansion. OH molecular packets cre-

ated at diﬀerent times in the expansion process are shown to have diﬀering
mean speeds and velocity widths. Figure 2b is a plot of several example TOF
proﬁles taken just before the skimmer where the discharge durations is 2 µs
for all the data. The time between the signal triggering the valve to open and
the discharge pulse, deﬁned as “ignition time,” for each trace is listed in the

legend. There is an ∼ 50 µs time delay between the valve trigger and the
valve opening. By timing the discharge correctly, OH molecular packets can
be created with a mean speed up to 465 m/s with the discharge ignition at
80 µs or down to 275 m/s with the discharge ignition at 190 µs. The mean
speed of the packet as a function of the discharge ignition time is summarized
in Fig. 2c .

A likely explanation for this discharge ignition-time dependent beam velocity
is that our current loop actuated valve does not operate instantaneously or
symmetrically. We see evidence of the asymmetric operation of the valve using
our pulsed discharge to sample diﬀerent parts of the expanding gas pulse. As
seen in Fig. 2c, the gas speed is large and constant over the ﬁrst 15 µs of
the pulse when the supersonic expansion has reached a steady-state beam
velocity while the number of molecules in the beam is still steadily increasing.
The speed of the gas gradually decreases as the valve begins to close and the
expansion is suboptimal. We note the peak signal size is reached (at ∼ 110
µs) only after the mean speed of the supersonic expansion beam has already
decreased. However, the FWHM longitudinal velocity spread is still a mere
16.6%.

We conﬁrm the asymmetric valve operation by measuring the Xe gas pulse
with a fast ion gauge (FIG). The FIG trace shows a pulse with a fast leading
edge and and much longer trailing edge.

For the application of a cooled molecular beam as an input to a Stark decel-
erator, we require a packet of OH molecules with a high phase-space density
propagating at a low mean speed. Choosing to create the OH molecules to-
wards the end of the gas pulse, for example at an ignition time of 160 µs,
produces a packet moving at an attractive mean speed of only 306 m/s. How-
ever the amplitude of the packet is signiﬁcantly smaller and the velocity width
is signiﬁcantly larger than a packet created at 110 µs. The variation of OH
packet amplitudes for diﬀerent ignition times can be seen in Fig. 2c . The
optimum discharge ignition time for our application is around 110 µs. For
diﬀerent applications (e.g. reactive collision dynamics), the tunability of the
mean speed of the molecular packet could be advantageous.

3.2 Filament assisted discharge

The other important component in the improved discharge-based system is a
hot ﬁlament in the source chamber. The hot ﬁlament has two major eﬀects on
the discharge. First, it allows the discharge to occur reliably and reproducibly
even at the shortest discharge pulse duration of 1 µs. The improvements from
a short discharge pulse duration are demonstrated in the previous section.

6

Second, the hot ﬁlament allows a stable discharge to occur at lower voltages
on the disc electrodes. Without the hot ﬁlament, the discharge is either not
stable or does not even occur at an electrode voltage less than 3 kV; using
the hot ﬁlament, the discharge is stable down to 0.7 kV, which results in a
signiﬁcantly colder molecular packet.

The longitudinal TOF proﬁle and rotational temperature of the OH molecular
packet are measured for diﬀerent discharge voltages (Fig. 3). For discharge
voltages below 1.9 kV, a single peak is observed in the TOF proﬁle. However,
for voltages at or above 1.9 kV, the TOF proﬁle starts to develop two distinct
maxima and indicates a considerably larger velocity spread. We expect this
heating arises from the higher energy electrons created by a larger potential
diﬀerence between the electrodes. As the voltage is lowered from 1.6 kV to
1.2 kV, the velocity spread remains nearly constant, but the peak number
of molecules decreases as the electrons’ energy decreases and thus creates
OH molecules less eﬃciently. The rotational temperature also elucidates the
heating eﬀect from the higher discharge voltages. The rotational temperature
is determined by measuring the ratio of OH molecules produced in the J =
3/2 and 5/2 states. The introduction of the hot ﬁlament permits the reduction
of the discharge voltage from 3 kV to an optimized voltage of 1.4 kV, leading
to almost a factor of four reduction in rotational temperature (Fig. 3b).

3.3 Optimized conditions

A Stark decelerator beneﬁts from a molecular beam that has both a high
phase-space density and a low mean longitudinal speed. The optimum conﬁg-
uration of the source for this application uses a 2 µs discharge duration that
is ignited 110 µs after the valve is triggered to open. The ﬁlament-assisted
discharge is created using a potential diﬀerence between the electrodes of 1.4
kV. A molecular packet created under these conditions has a mean velocity
of 422 m/s and a longitudinal velocity spread of 16.6%, which corresponds to
a translational temperature of 5 K. This is a signiﬁcantly colder translational
temperature than was reported by [11] of 26 K and [12] of 29 K.

The transverse velocity spread is determined through the use of the hexapole
focusing eﬀect and detailed numerical simulations. The density of OH is mea-
sured 2 mm downstream of the hexapole for diﬀerent hexapole voltages, thus
producing a focusing curve. From the comparison of the numerical simulations
to the hexapole focusing data the full-width transverse velocity spread is esti-
mated to be 35 m/s, which corresponds to a transverse temperature of ∼ 1.3
K.

The density of OH molecules just before the skimmer tip is determined from

= 3/2, f-component state created under these conditions is 3.5 ×1010cm−3
measured at a distance of 5 cm from the valve nozzle. To compare with the
density quoted in [11], we assume 1/r2 position dependence, where r is the
distance from the nozzle, and an equal population in e and f parity states. Our
calculated density at r = 2.3 cm in both parity states is ∼ 3 ×1011cm−3, which
is a factor of 2 less than [11]. This lower molecular density can be attributed to
a longer ﬂight time using Xenon versus Argon. The longer ﬂight time allows the
molecular packet to spread in both the longitudinal and transverse directions
reducing the density detected at a speciﬁc location.

4 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have developed and characterized a controllable discharge-
based source of cooled OH free radicals. Through the use of a pulsed discharge
we can tune the mean velocity of the OH beam from 465 m/s down to 275 m/s,

mentation of a hot ﬁlament in the source chamber allows a stable discharge
to occur for short discharge pulse durations and at low discharge voltages. We
have shown that decreasing the discharge pulse duration and voltage creates
a colder packet of OH molecules.

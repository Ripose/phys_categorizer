We calculate resonances in three-body systems with attractive Coulomb potentials by solving the homogeneous
Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations for complex energies. The equations are solved by using the Coulomb-
Sturmian separable expansion approach. This approach provides an exact treatment of the threshold behavior
of the three-body Coulombic systems. We considered the negative positronium ion and, besides locating all
the previously know S-wave resonances, we found a whole bunch of new resonances accumulated just slightly
above the two-body thresholds. The way they accumulate indicates that probably there are inﬁnitely many
resonances just above the two-body thresholds, and this might be a general property of three-body systems with
attractive Coulomb potentials.

The most common method for calculating resonant states
in quantum mechanical systems is the one based on the com-
plex rotation of coordinates. The complex rotation turns the
resonant behavior of the wave function into a bound-state-
like asymptotic behavior. Then, standard bound-state meth-
ods become applicable also for calculating resonances. The
complex rotation of the coordinates does not change the dis-
crete spectrum, the branch cut, which corresponds to scatter-
ing states, however, is rotated down onto the complex energy
plane, and as a consequence, resonant states from the unphys-
ical sheet become accessible. By changing the rotation an-
gle the points corresponding to the continuum move, while
those corresponding to discrete states, like bound and reso-
nant states, stay. This way one can determine resonance pa-
rameters. In three-body systems there are several branch cuts
associated with two-body thresholds.

In practice, the complex rotational technique is combined
with some variational approach. This results in a discretiza-
tion of the rotated continuum. The points of the discretized
continuum scatter around the rotated-down straight line. So,
especially around thresholds it is not easy to decide whether
a point is a resonance point or it belongs to the rotated con-
tinuum. Moreover, variational methods approach states from
above, so resonances slightly above the thresholds may easily
get lost.

Recently, we have developed a method for calculating res-
onances in three-body Coulombic systems by solving homo-
geneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations [1] using the
Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion approach [2]. As a
test case, we calculated the resonances of the negative positro-
nium ion. This system has been extensively studied in the past
two decades and thus serves as test example for new methods.
We found all the 12 S-wave resonances presented in Ref. [3]
and observed good agreements in all cases.

We also observed that in case of attractive Coulomb interac-
tions the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations may produce
spurious resonances [4], which are related to the somewhat
arbitrary splitting of the potential in the three-body conﬁgu-

ration space into short-range and long-range terms. We could
single them out by changing those parameters. We succeeded
in locating 10 more resonances in the same energy region, all
of them are very close to the thresholds. These new reso-
nances were published in Ref. [4].

As our skill in applying our method developed we located
more an more new resonances just slightly above the two-
body thresholds. They are all aligned along a line in the com-
plex energy plane pointing toward the thresholds. It seems
that there are inﬁnitely many resonances accumulating at the
two-body thresholds. Since our method is relatively new we
brieﬂy outline the basic concepts and the numerical tech-
niques, specialized to the e−e−e+ system (further details are
in Refs. [2, 4]).

The Hamiltonian of a three-body atomic system is given by

H = H 0 + vC

1 + vC

2 + vC
3 ,

(1)

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and vC
α
denotes the Coulomb potential in the subsystem α, with α =
1, 2, 3. We use throughout the usual conﬁguration-space Ja-
cobi coordinates xα and yα, where xα is the coordinate of the
(β, γ) pair and yα connects the center of mass of (β, γ) to
the particle α, respectively. Thus vC
α , the potential between
particles β and γ, depends on xα.

The Hamiltonian (1) is deﬁned in the three-body Hilbert
space. The three-body kinetic energy, when the center-of-
mass motion is separated, is given by
xβ + h0
xα + h0

yα = h0

yβ = h0

xγ + h0

H 0 = h0

yγ ,

(2)

where h0 is the two-body kinetic energy. The two-body poten-
tial operators are formally embedded in the three-body Hilbert
space vC = vC (x)1y, where 1y is a unit operator in the two-
body Hilbert space associated with the y coordinate.

In Merkuriev’s approach to the three-body Coulomb prob-
lem [1] the Coulomb interaction is split, in the three-body con-
ﬁguration space, into short- and long-range terms

α = v(s)

where the short- and long-range parts are deﬁned via a split-

(cid:26)

where x0, y0 > 0 and ν > 2. So, in the region of three-
body conﬁguration space where particles β and γ are close to
each other v(s)

v(s)

ζ(x, y) = 2/ {1 + exp [(x/x0)ν /(1 + y/y0)]} ,

(7)

is used. Typical picture for v(s) and v(l) are seen in Fig. 1.

In atomic three-particle systems the sign of the charge is
always identical for two particles. Let us denote those two
particles by 1 and 2, and the third one by 3. In this case vC
3
is a repulsive Coulomb potential which does not support two-
body bound states. Therefore the entire vC
3 can be considered
as long-range potential and the Hamiltonian can formally be
written in a form which looks like an usual three-body Hamil-
tonian with two short-range potentials

H = H (l) + v(s)

1 + v(s)
2 ,

where the long-range Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

1 + v(l)

2 + vC
3 .

Then, the Faddeev method is applicable and, in this particu-
lar case, results in a splitting of the wave function into two
components

|Ψi = |ψ1i + |ψ2i.

(10)

The components are deﬁned by |ψαi = G(l)(z)v(s)
α |Ψi,
where α = 1, 2 and G(l)(z) = (z − H (l))−1, z is a complex
number.

Further simpliﬁcation can be achieved if we take into ac-
count that particles 1 and 2 are identical and indistinguishable.
Then, the Faddeev components |ψ1i and |ψ2i, in their own
natural Jacobi coordinates, have the same functional forms
hx1y1|ψ1i = hx2y2|ψ2i. On the other hand |ψ2i = pP|ψ1i,
where P is the operator for the permutation of indexes 1 and
2 and p = ±1 denotes the eigenvalue of P. Therefore we can
determine |ψ1i from the ﬁrst equation only

|ψ1i = G(l)

1 v(s)

1 pP|ψ1i.

(13)

It should be noted, that so far we did not make any approxi-
mation, and although this integral equation has only one com-
ponent, yet it gives full account both of asymptotic and sym-
metry properties of the system.

We solve Eq. (13) by using the Coulomb–Sturmian separa-
ble expansion approach. The Coulomb-Sturmian (CS) func-
tions are deﬁned by

(14)
n and l are the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum
numbers, respectively, and b is the size parameter of the basis.
The CS functions {|nli} form a biorthonormal discrete basis
in the radial two-body Hilbert space; the biorthogonal partner
is deﬁned by hr|
nli = hr|nli/r. Since the three-body Hilbert
space is a direct product of two-body Hilbert spaces an appro-
priate basis can be deﬁned as the angular momentum coupled
direct product of the two-body bases

|nνlλi1 = |nli1 ⊗ |νλi1,

(n, ν = 0, 1, 2, . . .),

(15)

where |nli1 and |νλi1 are associated with the coordinates x1
and y1, respectively. With this basis the completeness relation

(20)

So, to calculate resonances, we need to search for the zeros of
determinant D(z) on the complex energy plane.

The Green’s operator G(l)
is related to the Hamiltonian
1
H (l)
1 , which is still a three-body Coulomb Hamiltonian and
seems to be as complicated as H itself. However this is not
the case. The only possible two-body asymptotic conﬁgura-
tion for H (l)
is when particles 2 and 3 form a bound states and
1
particle 1 is at inﬁnity. The corresponding asymptotic Hamil-
tonian is

H1 = H 0 + vC
1 .

Therefore, in the spirit of the three-potential formalism [5],
G(l)
G1(z) = (z −

Now, what is remained is the calculation of the matrix el-
G1, since the potential matrix elements v(s)

which act in different two-body Hilbert spaces. Thus,

The contour C should be taken counterclockwise around the
continuous spectrum of hy1 such a way that gx1 is analytic
on the domain encircled by C. With the contour on Fig. 2 this
mathematical condition is met even for resonant-state energies
with z = E − iΓ/2. The corresponding CS matrix elements
of the two-body Green’s operators in the integrand are known
exactly and analytically for all complex energies (see [5] and
references therein). From this follows that all the thresholds,

of z
on the [0, ∞) interval, while gx1 (E + iε − z
) has a branch-cut on
the (−∞, E + iε] interval and inﬁnitely many poles accumulated at
E + iε (denoted by dots). The contour C encircles the branch-cut
of gy1 such that a part of it goes on the unphysical Riemann-sheet
of gy1 (drawn by broken line) and the other part detoured away from
the cut. The branch-cut and some poles of gx1 (denoted by full dots)
are lying on the physical Riemann-sheet, some other poles (denoted
by empty dots) are lying on the un-physical Riemann-sheet of gy1,
respectively. Yet, the contour avoids the singularities of gx1 .

To calculate resonances we have to ﬁnd the complex ze-
ros of the Fredholm determinant D(z) of Eq. (20). Between
thresholds D(z) is analytic, therefore, due to a theorem of ho-
momorphic functions [6],

where NC ′ is the number of zeros inside the contour C′. By
calculating (24) numerically we can decide whether a domain
contains a resonance or not.

We considered the S-wave resonances of the e−e−e+ sys-
tem. The resonances, found at the vicinity of thresholds, are
seen in Fig. 3. The calculations were performed with three
entirely different sets of parameters: x0 = 18 and y0 = 50,
x0 = 25 and y0 = 50, x0 = 5 and y0 = 1000, while ν = 2.1
in all cases (the lengths are given in a0 units). We found, that
the results at N = 20 CS basis states and angular momen-
tum channels up to l = λ = 10 are well converged and they
are rather insensitive for the choice of CS parameter b over
a broad interval. The resonances displayed in Fig. 3 are sta-
ble against the change of x0 and y0 parameters, they exhibit a
remarkable 5 − 6 digits stability.

We can see that the resonances are aligned along a line
pointing exactly to the two-body thresholds. As we stretched
the code and went closer and closer to the threshold we dis-
covered more and more resonances. All of them were along
the line. This indicates that the two-body threshold is an ac-
cumulation point of the resonances, and probably there are
inﬁnitely many there.

This conclusion is supported by our previous study of the
e+ +H system [7], where violent oscillations of the cross sec-
tions just above two-body thresholds were found. Preliminary
resonance calculations with the present method show that in

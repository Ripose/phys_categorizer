A method is proposed that utilizes a Feshbach resonance to cool an atomic gas to temperatures of
quantum degeneracy. Through application of a sequence of alternating adiabatic and nonadiabatic
magnetic ﬁeld ramps in the region of a Feshbach resonance, a large number of atom pairs in a
trapped gas lose energy at the expense of a relatively small number of pairs which gain energy.
After removal from the trap of the atom pairs which gain energy, the remaining reduced energy
atoms will equilibrate to a lower temperature.

Despite remarkable strides in cooling atomic gases to
the temperature range of quantum degeneracy, cool-
ing techniques remain limited.
In most experiments,
for instance, some form of evaporative cooling [1, 2] is
carried out after the atomic cloud temperature is re-
duced to the 10–100 µK range in a magneto-optical trap
(MOT). In some current experiments, nevertheless, it re-
mains desirable to improve the ability to cool the atomic
gas.
In an optical dipole trap, for instance, trapping
has been demonstrated [3], but in only a few experi-
ments has it proven possible to perform additional cool-
ing of the cloud. It is also desirable to ﬁnd alternative
cooling methods that might prove amenable to cooling
fermionic clouds below the present day limit that has
been achieved, namely T ≈ 0.2TF .

The recent observation that most atomic species ex-
hibit Feshbach resonances [4, 5, 6] at low energies has
sparked the present study of whether these resonances
might be coherently controlled to cool the gas. Our
ﬁndings, presented in this Letter, suggest that this tech-
nique exhibits diﬀerent scaling properties with tempera-
ture and with atom number, which could prove advanta-
geous for some species.

The concept of Feshbach resonance cooling grew out
of the observation that the quantum mechanical energy
levels of two atoms in a harmonic trap aquire one extra
level as a control parameter is swept in one direction
through the resonance. Throughout this Letter, we refer
to this control parameter as B, the magnetic ﬁeld used
to manipulate the atom-atom scattering length in the
vicinity of a pole. In other contexts, however, the control
could be achieved instead by varying the detuning of an
oﬀ-resonant dressing laser, or an electric ﬁeld strength,
for instance. The ideas presented here can be trivially
extended to those other contexts.

Figure 1(a) shows the characteristic s-wave energy lev-
els for the relative motion of two atoms in a spherical
harmonic oscillator trap as a function of the applied mag-
netic ﬁeld. The term that plays the crucial role in Fesh-

bach resonance cooling is

the energy associated with the relative motion of an
atom pair [7]. The quantum defect βεl depends strongly
on the relative orbital angular momentum of the pair,
while it depends only weakly on the radial oscillator
quantum number n. The dependence of βεl(B) on the
energy is weak on the scale of an oscillator quantum,
i.e. |dβεl(B)/dε| ≪ 1/¯hω. For eﬃcient cooling, on the
other hand, the quantum defect for one partial wave
(typically the s-wave, l = 0) must rise by unity across
the energy range kB∆T of interest, and across the ac-
cessible range of the control parameter, ∆B. A sim-
[8, 9], which
ple closed form expression exists for βεl

fact the Feshbach resonance which causes the scattering
phaseshift to rise by π.

When the two-body partial wave that exhibits the Fes-
hbach resonance is the s-wave, the scattering phaseshift
energy dependence is proportional to the wavenumber
k = (2µε/¯h2)1/2. In this paper, we focus on an s-wave
resonance, with an ε- and B-dependent scattering length:

Here dε/dB is the rate at which the Feshbach reasonance
energy varies with the magnetic ﬁeld B. The resonance
produces a zero-energy bound state at B = B0. The res-
onance width in energy is denoted Γε, while its width in
1.
the control parameter B is denoted ΓB = Γε (kdε/dB)−
Typical values of these parameters, e.g.
for the mag-
netic Feshbach resonance in 85Rb(2, −2) +85 Rb(2, −2)
are B0 = 155.2 G, dε/dB = 3.5 MHz/G, and ΓB = 10 G.

FIG. 1:
(a) The energy levels for the relative coordinate of a
harmonically trapped atom pair are shown in oscillator energy
units (¯hω) near a Feshbach resonance, versus the magnetic
ﬁeld in Gauss. Speciﬁcally, this plot depicts the energy level
behavior for the B0 ≈ 155.2 G Feshbach resonance for 85Rb.
A rather large trapping frequency of νtrap = 1 MHz is used
in order to clarify the ﬁeld dependence of the level shifts. (b)
A close-up view of the energy level shift, illustrating a range
of ﬁeld ramps used for cooling. The magnetic ﬁeld must be
ramped slowly from B1 to B2 and then quickly back to B1.
The trap energy level, labeled Q, which is undergoing a shift
at the ﬁeld value of B2 is indicated.

Feshbach resonance cooling of a gas of atoms entails
ramping the magnetic ﬁeld through the region of the en-
ergy level shift. The Schr¨odinger equation for two non-
interacting atoms in a spherical oscillator trap can be
solved in either independent particle coordinates relative
to the center of the trap, or else in terms of relative and
center-of-mass coordinates of the pair. Accordingly, we
view the cloud as consisting of a thermal distribution
among the various energy eigenstates in the relative co-
ordinate. The atom pairs in a gas subject to a magnetic
ﬁeld B = B1 can be viewed as being distributed among
the energy levels shown in Fig. 1(b). By ramping the
magnetic ﬁeld to B = B2 (also shown in Fig. 1(b)) suﬃ-
ciently slowly to be adiabatic, the population of each en-
ergy level will remain the same, each following the down-
ward shift in energy. This causes the population of each
of the s-wave levels that undergo an energy shift in the
range from B = B1 to B = B2 to lose 2¯hω of energy.
In order to repeat this process, the magnetic ﬁeld must
be returned to the other side of the resonance. A fast,
nonadiabatic change of the magnetic ﬁeld in this direc-
tion simply projects each state at B = B2 onto those at
B = B1.

To test the eﬀects of such ﬁeld ramps on an atomic sys-
tem, we have constructed an approximate model of the
Feshbach resonance cooling process. Our model Hamilto-
nian is written in terms of the unperturbed s-wave har-
monic oscillator states, labeled |ni with n ≥ 1, along
with the resonance state, labeled |0i. Reference [10] pro-
vides a justiﬁcation for representing the Feshbach reso-

nance physics in this manner. The matrix elements of
this Hamiltonian are taken to be

h0|H|0i = A(B − B0),
hn|H|n′i = 2(n − 1)¯hωδn,n′,
h0|H|ni = hn|H|0i = Cn1/4,

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld, B0 is the resonance ﬁeld
value at zero energy, and A and C are adjustable param-
eters. The factor of n1/4 in the oﬀ-diagonal elements of
the Hamiltonian produces the correct near-threshold en-
ergy dependence of the coupling strengths. The strength
of this coupling is related to the resonance width Γε [10],

2π |h0|H|ni|2 = Γε

∂εn
∂n

,

where ∂εn/∂n is the density of s-wave states near the
resonance. The parameters A, B0, and C were deter-
mined by comparison of the eigenvalues of Eq. (3) from
diagonalization to the exact eigenvalues determined by
Eq. (1).

Once the parameters A, B0, and C were determined for
a particular resonance, the cooling process was simulated
by choosing an initial distribution of states and numer-
ically solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3), varying the magnetic
ﬁeld B = B(t) with time according to the prescribed ﬁeld
ramps. The initial condition described the initial popu-
lation of trap states for the gas. The results of the ﬁeld
ramps were then used to determine the ﬁnal population
of states.

The numerical cooling simulations indicate that the
population in the trap state that is nearly degenerate in
energy with the resonance state at the beginning of a fast
ramp remains in the resonance state during the ramp,
ending up in the trap state nearly degenerate with the
resonance state at the ﬁnal value of the magnetic ﬁeld.
That is, the cooling process is successful for most of the
states, causing the population of those states to be moved
to the next lowest s-wave oscillator level and losing 2¯hω
in energy. It is not successful for the population of the
state that is close in energy to the resonance state at the
beginning of the ramp, because that population gains
energy. The amount of energy gained due to this small
population is always more than the amount of energy lost
by the remainder of the gas, producing a net increase in
energy. Thus, the system of ﬁeld ramps alone cannot
produce cooling. However, if the atoms that gain energy
are removed from the trap, the remainder of the gas can
still be reduced in energy. Moreover, the process of the
ﬁeld ramps produces a gas in which the atom pairs that
gain energy have a large energy diﬀerence from the rest of
the atom pairs which lost energy. Due to this distinction,
selective removal of the hot atoms is possible through
methods similar to those used in evaporative cooling.

Since cooling will require removal of atoms, the eﬃ-
ciency of the process must be considered. Figure 2 il-
lustrates the eﬀect of a Feshbach resonance cooling cycle
on an s-wave distribution of atom pairs. The result of a
cooling cycle is to remove the atoms from the state nearly
degenerate with the resonance state (which we label here
as n = Q) and to decrease the energy of the popula-
tion of states above this state by 2¯hω. For simplicity,
we assume that the magnetic ﬁeld is ramped to a value
such that the population of large-n states unaﬀected by
the ramp is negligible. The average number of atoms re-
moved during one cooling cycle, due to the atoms in the
state n = Q, is

where N S

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the tempera-
ture. The amount of energy removed, due to the energy
of atoms in the state n = Q which were removed and the
energy lost by the population that moved to a lower trap
level, is

In this form, the substitution in Eq. (10) can be included.
We now use the cooling equations derived to treat the
speciﬁc case of 109 85Rb atoms in a 100 Hz isotropic har-
monic oscillator trap, at an initial temperature of 1 µK.
We use Eqs. (5) and (13) iteratively, taking into account
Eq. (10) to ﬁnd the temperature of the gas as a func-
tion of the number of atoms in the gas. The results are
shown in Fig. 3(a) for three diﬀerent values of the cooling
parameter: Q = 3τ /2¯hω, 5τ /¯hω and 10τ /¯hω. The sig-
niﬁcance of choosing Q = 3τ /2¯hω is that it produces the
greatest temperature change per cycle (i.e., it minimizes
Eq. (13)). The values Q = 5τ /¯hω and Q = 10τ /¯hω were
selected to demonstrate slower but more eﬃcient cool-
ing. From Fig. 3(a) it can be seen that, for this case,
the fastest cooling is prohibitively ineﬃcient, requiring

removal of almost all of the atoms to reach T = 1 nK.
However, both of the other values of Q mentioned above
allow cooling to 1 nK with a large number of atoms re-
maining. Figure 3(b) shows the temperature and the
number of atoms as a function of the number of cool-
ing cycles for Q = 5τ /¯hω. Approximately 70 cycles are
required to cool to 1 nK.

The length of time required to perform a cooling cycle
is determined by the speed of the adiabatic ﬁeld ramp.
This speed in turn is determined by the strength of the
coupling between the resonance state and the trap states.
The smaller the coupling for an avoided crossing, the
slower the ﬁeld ramp required to maintain adiabaticity
and cause the atom pair to follow the energy curve down.
This coupling increases with n [10], so the length of time
required for a cooling cycle will be set by the n = Q level,
since this is the lowest trap state that will be ramped
through the energy level shift. If the coupling is known,
it can be related to the resonance width parameter by
Eq. (4) which can be used in a Landau-Zener estimate of

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

This is the probability that an atom pair will jump
across the avoided crossing and therefore the probabil-
ity for adiabatic following of the energy curve is given by
Pcool = 1 − Ptransition.

Note that the cooling cycles only act only to reduce the
energy in the relative motion of any given atom pair, and
do not aﬀect the energy of the center-of-mass (CM) of the
pair. This exact separation of relative and CM energies
is no longer exact, however, if the trap is anisotropic or if
collisions with other atoms are included. Our premise for
this cooling scheme is that over the course of the cooling
process, an approximate state of thermal equilibrium will
be retained, though the gas does not necessarily have to
equilibrate on a time scale as fast as the ﬁeld ramps.

For an atomic gas in a 100 Hz harmonic oscillator trap
at 1 µK, Q = 5τ /¯hω corresponds to approximately the
n = 520 s-wave trap level. Using Eq. (3) with a param-
eter value of C = 70 produces h0|H|ni ≈ 334 oscillator
units. From Eqs. (4) and (14) we ﬁnd that Pcool = 1−1/e
for dB/dτ ≈ 6 G/s. Thus, to ensure adiabaticity, the
slow ﬁeld ramp must be somewhat slower than 6 G/s,
while the return ramp must be performed faster than
this value. For the particular value of the cooling pa-
rameter that we are discussing here, the ﬁeld ramps for
a T = 1 µK gas must be performed from the maximum
value of B =155.0 G, to a minimum value of less than
154.8 G. Thus a cooling cycle will require only 0.03 s at
this temperature. As the temperature decreases, the
value of Q will be adjusted correspondingly and the range
of the magnetic ﬁeld ramps will decrease, becoming closer
to the resonance ﬁeld value B = B0. Additionally, the
coupling of the n = Q level to the resonance state will
increase as the temperature decreases, requiring slower
adiabatic ﬁeld ramps. The time taken for the 70 cool-
ing cyles mentioned above is estimated to be about 2 s.
These estimates suggest that this cooling scheme has po-
tential advantages over existing methods, especially for
atoms held in an optical dipole trap.

Perturbative approach to the hydrogen atom in
strong magnetic ﬁeld

V. A. Gani, A. E. Kudryavtsev, V. A. Lensky, V. M. Weinberg

Abstract

The states of hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n ≤ 3 and zero magnetic
quantum number in constant homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld H are considered. The perturbation
theory series is summed with the help of Borel transformation and conformal mapping of the
Borel variable. Convergence of approximate energy eigenvalues and their agreement with
corresponding existing results are observed for external ﬁelds up to n3H ∼ 5. The possibility
of restoring the asymptotic behaviour of energy levels using perturbation theory coeﬃcients
is also discussed.

The own magnetic ﬁelds of some astrophysical objects reach very high values [1, 2].

If we
are interesting of the atomic spectra in these external ﬁelds, it is convenient to introduce natural
measure of ﬁeld strength – the atomic magnetic ﬁeld H0 ≡ e3m2c/~3 = 2.55 × 109 G. The ﬁelds
H up to one half of H0 are detected in vicinity of some white dwarfs. Neutron stars possess ﬁelds
up to ∼ 104H0. For correct interpretation of the observations results it is desirable to know the
atomic hydrogen spectrum in this range of external ﬁelds. For this aim, computations based on
adiabatic approach with Landau level as initial approximation were accomplished [3]. It will be
shown here which part of the desired external ﬁeld range could be covered with the help of the
usual expansion in powers of H, starting from the Coulomb levels of hydrogen atom. We involved
in the computations many orders of perturbation theory (up to 75th order). Summation of the
series was performed with the help of Borel transformation, supplemented by conformal mapping
of Borel variable.

The Borel summation method was introduced into quantum ﬁeld theory long enough (see
It has been tested on some quantum-mechanical problems (one of many examples is
e.g. [4]).
described in [5]) and continues to ﬁnd applications in modern works [6]. Large hopes on the possi-
bility to advance into strong coupling region were related with Borel summation of the perturbation
series. Some rather simple problems, in which details can be traced and compared with correspond-
ing exact results, supported this optimism. For example, for the funnel potential, V (r) = −1/r+gr,
by applying conformal mapping of the Borel variable and Pad´e-summation of the Borel transfor-
mant, the ground state energy at g → ∞ was obtained in the form E(g) = Cgν with ∼ 0.2 %
precision for index ν and ∼ 5 % precision for coeﬃcient C [5]. It became clear later that such a
successful summation presents a special but not the general case. One can guess that this success
is a consequence of simplicity of this problem. In contrast, asymptotic behaviour of energy levels
in Stark and Zeeman eﬀects comes into action at very large external ﬁelds values. For the Stark
eﬀect it is practically impossible now to reach the region of true asymptotic by perturbation series
summation. An intermediate linear asymptotic is observed instead [7, 8].
To introduce notations and scale we write down the Hamiltonian

Here g ≡ H2, and hereafter we use units ~ = c = m = e = 1. In (1) we drop the elementary
contribution of electron’s spin and consider only states with magnetic quantum number m ≡ 0.
We can expand E(g) as a formal series in powers of g:

E(g) =

Ekgk.

Now, we have to obtain hypersucceptibilities Ek. We could use the moment method for this aim.
This method is especially useful in the cases when variables in the Schr¨odinger equation can not be
separated. Obviously the Zeeman eﬀect presents just such a problem. In the previous work [9] the
moment method was applied to recurrent evaluation of hypersucceptibilities. Somewhat diﬀerent
version of the moment method was introduced in the work [10].

For the four lower ”isolated” hydrogen levels we immediately use here the results of ref. [9]. Un-
fortunately the computer code, employed in the work [9] for the relatively more complicated case
of degenerate 3s and 3d states, contained a mistake1. Therefore we carried out new computation of
3s and 3d hypersucceptibilities. Results of computation for some orders are presented in Table 1.
These results are in agreement with results of the work [11] where high-order hypersucceptibilities
were obtained at the ﬁrst time (but the method used in [11] is much more complicated than the
moment method is).

As the order k increases, hypersucceptibilities grow as a factorial [12]

where an = (n2/π)2, βnl = 2n−1+ (−1)l
, and Cnl are not essential for us; one can ﬁnd values of them
in [9] and references therein. Eq. (3) implies that series (2) is asymptotical and the formal sum of
such a series is ambiguous. But in fact the choice of the summation method is restricted: physical
considerations impose analytical properties of the function E(g), which the true sum of series (2)
is to reproduce. In the unphysical region, at g < 0, the diamagnetic perturbation g ˆH1 changes its
sign, the total Hamiltonian becomes ”open” and the possibility of a spontaneous ionization of the
atom appears. Therefore energy eigenvalue should have imaginary part at g < 0 and the function
E(g) should have a cut along real negative semi-axis of g plane. Summation with the help of Borel
transformation results in a function having the left cut, besides the discontinuity on this cut is a
smooth function of g.

The Borel transformant B(w) of function E(g) is a series with coeﬃcients Bk = Ek/Γ(2k + b0):

B(w) =

where b0 is an arbitrary constant. The choice of b0 can aﬀect, in principle, on the numerical results,
but changing of its value within interval ∼ [0.5 ≤ b0 ≤ 5] reveals weakly, so the choice of b0 was
made rather by convenience. The numerical calculations in this work were performed at b0 = 3. The
series (4) converges, as usual, within the circle |w| < 1/an. It is easy to check that the singularity
of B(w) is located at w = −1/an, substituting asymptotical coeﬃcients ˜Ek in place of Ek. Energy
of the level is related with the function B(w) by an integral transform

E(g) =

e−xB(gx2)xb0−1dx.

For the numerical integration in the right hand side to be successful, an analytical continuation of
B(w) from its convergence circle on the domain, containing the image of the entire real positive w
semi-axis is required. For this aim we performed conformal mapping of the Borel variable w. Many
suﬃciently eﬀective versions of this mapping are appropriate. The main point is that the nearest
singularity of the Borel transformant should be removed to inﬁnity. Here we used the mapping

y =

anw
1 + anw

which was employed in the work [6]. As is explained in [6], this transformation is optimal in the
sense that it diminishes the inﬂuence of all possible singularities of B(w) from the unphysical region.
Transformation (6) is equivalent to the following series rearrangement

To improve the convergence we applied Pad´e summation to rearranged series (7)

B(w) ≈ [M/N](y) ≡ PM (y)/QN (y),

where PM and QN are polynomials of degree M and N respectively.

We performed computations using various Pad´e approximants and straightforward summation
of the rearranged series (7). To illustrate the inﬂuence of computational accuracy on summation
results we compared ones made in double precision (16 decimal digits) with these in quadruple
precision (32 decimal digits).

Some graphs of the obtained binding energy E(H) =

values for which these eigenvalues are successfully recovered is extended by a factor of about 5. As
usual the precision of the sum considerably increases at lower H values. For instance in the case of
3d state with the help of approximants [N/N](y) in the range 27 ≤ N ≤ 32 we get binding energies
with 4 stable decimal digits at γ = 4, with 6 digits at γ = 3 and with 12 digits at γ = 1. Note
that in the work [9] Pad´e approximants were applied immediately to summation of divergent series
(2). These approximants imitate the discontinuity on the cut g < 0 by a set of delta-functions,
and it is a very rough approximation. At the same time as a result of Borel summation the same
discontinuity is represented by a smooth function of g. Our calculations conﬁrmed that mapping (6)
is indeed very eﬀective: after this mapping Pad´e summation of the Borel transformant improves the
convergence only a little and for some cases its straightforward summation appears to be suﬃcient
– see Figs. 1-3.

One technical detail is of principal importance for perturbation series summation by any method.
The precision of the entire chain of computations must increase as the number of involved successive
terms increases. This is simply a consequence of the fact that the sum, being of the order of unity,
arises as a result of very large alternating sign terms compensation.

It seems at ﬁrst sight that the requirement of high precision is not necessary for the Borel
transformant: all essential alternating sign coeﬃcients Bk have about the same order. But any
numerical procedure of analytical continuation usually requires high precision. Turning to series
rearrangement (7) we see that binomial coeﬃcients entering the sum for Dk are changing 20 orders of
magnitude (in the present case). Obviously, we have enormous loss of precision performing the sum
for Dk in (7). Therefore, if we want to use all Bk up to 75th order, the precision of Bk coeﬃcients
should be better than ∼ 10−20.
In our calculations, the precision of Ek and, consequently, the
precision of Bk was ∼ 10−30, so the precision of Dk was decreasing from 10−30 at k = 0 to about
10−10 at k = 75.

Let us turn now to the problem of restoring of the E(g) dependence at large g values. We shall
focus on the ground state. First of all we note that in work [3] an interpolation expression for the
ground (tightly bound) state energy was obtained. In spite of the multiple anticrossings at H ≤ 300
and of the related computations complicating, the ﬁt of [3] provides precision within 10−3 ÷ 10−2
in the range of H values 0.1 ≤ H ≤ 104.

The ground level energy asymptotic at large g (or, the same, at large H) is given by

E(H) →

(9)

(see, for example, [14]). Here c is a dimensionless constant. First, we consider the possibility of
restoring of the leading term parameters in (9) – the power index and the constant multiplier –
using perturbation theory. Methods applicable to this problem are considered in [5, 6]. Note that
for coming of the asymptotic into action the leading term in (9) should be large comparing with the
correction term. One can look, for example, at the results of work [13] (where the values of E(H)
were obtained by variational procedure) and ensure that only if H > 102 then the binding energy
will make less than 20% of 1
2 H. So, we can speculate about restoring of asymptotic parameters
only if we succeeded in summation of E(g) in this region of external ﬁelds. But we failed to do
this having used only 75 coeﬃcients Ek, so the linear asymptotic couldn’t be restored. This was
conﬁrmed in our attempts to apply methods suggested in the works [5, 6] – no plausible result was
obtained. In the method of Ref. [6], parameters of asymptotic of the function E(g) were linked to
behaviour of coeﬃcients Dk in dependence of their number k at large k. Namely, if E(g) → Cgν
at g → ∞, then in our case we get similarly to [6]

Dk →

Ckν−1

Then it was suggested to perform the ﬁt of C and ν using known Dk and their errors by means
of the χ2 method. But in our case the value of χ2 in its minimum was extremely large (about 108
even if we tried to ﬁt only 5 coeﬃcients Dk at statistical error σ = 10−10, and we had no reason
to increase this value of σ). This result indicates that the asymptotic of Dk comes into action at
values of k much larger than 75.

The power index in E(g) asymptotic could be traced also using the method of [5]. This method

wB′(w)
B(w)

at w → ∞ (or, the same, the limit of

concerns of taking of the limit of the expression
y(1 − y)B′(y)
B(y)

at y → 1), that gives exactly the value of ν. But numerical calculation showed that

in the region where B(y) was recovered (at y close to 1 we obviously should have increasing of error
due to ﬁnite number of Dk used) we did not get reasonable precision for the limit value.

Fig. 4 illustrates precision of the linear asymptotic. The curve plotted represents the binding
energy (we used here formula (6) of Ref. [3]) divided by Landau energy versus external ﬁeld. One
can see that at H ≤ 100 error of asymptotic is more than 20%, and only at H ∼ 1000 precision
reaches level of 1%. So, it appears to be impossible to obtain asymptotic parameters corresponding
to Landau level for the Zeeman eﬀect.

Now, the question arises, whether we can subtract Landau energy from E(H) and trace the
second term of asymptotic. But this term doesn’t work even at H ∼ 105, which the graph of Fig. 5
is to explain. We plotted there the values of binding energy, and the value of its logarithmic asymp-
totic. We have chosen constant c in such a way, that the value of logarithmic term (1/2) ln2(cH)
of the asymptotic coincides with the data of [13] at H = 105. This occurs at c = 0.010 and the
smallness of this constant indicates that the value of H is too small for speaking about asymptotic.
And one can see that asymptotic curve and curve of exact data have considerably diﬀerent
slopes. It means that we have to recover dependence of the energy at the values of external ﬁelds
larger than 105. But it is really impossible having known only 75 coeﬃcients Ek. Thus, knowledge
of 75 hypersucceptibilities did not allow to restore neither parameters of the Landau asymptotic
nor logarithmic asymptotic of binding energy.

Abstract

In the present work, a theoretical treatment is proposed to study the double ionization of homonu-

clear diatomic targets by fast electron impact. By application of two-eﬀective-center continuum

waves to describe the ejected electrons in the exit channel and by use of Nordsieck-type integrals,

an expression has been obtained by an analytical treatment for the ﬁvefold diﬀerential cross sec-

tion, the relevant quantity to describe the kinematically complete (e,3e) collisions in the coplanar

geometry. The correlate motion of the ejected electrons is taken into account by means of adequate

Sommerfeld parameters.

INTRODUCTION

Ionization of atoms and molecules by electron impact is one of the fundamental processes

of atomic physics, whose comprehension becomes important in many domains such as plasma

physics and nuclear fusion devices [1]. In particular, the study of kinematically complete

double ionization experiments by electron impact, also called (e,3e) reactions, provides a

straightforward and powerful tool to understand the role of the electron-correlation eﬀects

as well as the projectile-target interaction during the collision process.

The ﬁrst theoretical studies of double ionization of atoms by electron impact by Byron

and Joachain[2], Smirnov et al.

[3] and Neudatchin et al.

[4] appealed for experiments,

which were carried out several years later by Lahmam-Bennani et al. [5, 6]. However, the

development of (e,3e) experiments rapidely turned out to be very challenging. On the one

hand, the need for using triple-coincidence techniques, to detect energies and angles of the

electrons produced by the reaction, is a serious experimental limitation. On the other hand,

an additional complication for measurements arises from the low intensity of the double

ionization cross section .

Nevertheless, the technical advances achieved in the area of high sensitivity detection and

the emergence over the last few years of a new generation of sophisticated spectrometers

[7, 8, 9] have renewed the interest for the experimental study of double ionization by electron

impact [10].

From the theoretical point view, only few models have been proposed to describe kine-

matically complete double ionization on atomic targets [11, 12].

In the case of diatomic

targets, the description of the continuum electrons in the ﬁeld of two Coulomb or distorted

centers is much more diﬃcult. The use of the solutions of the two-center Schr¨odinger equa-

tion in prolate spheroidal coordinates to determine the multiply diﬀerential cross section

results with such computational diﬃculties that their direct application turns out rapidly

to a purely numerical problem relevant to the computer science ﬁeld.

In the present study, we propose a theoretical model of the double ionization of homonu-

clear diatomic molecules by fast electron impact. A two-eﬀective-center approach (TEC),

which has shown to successfully reproduce (e,2e) experiments on molecular hydrogen tar-

gets [13, 14], is applied to describe the ejected electrons in the exit channel. By use of

Nordsieck-type integrals [15] and dynamic Sommerfeld parameters [16], an expression has

2

been obtained by an analytical approach for the ﬁvefold diﬀerential cross section (5DCS),

which is the relevant quantity to describe the kinematically complete (e,3e) collisions in

the coplanar geometry. As an illustration of our theoretical treatment, we present 5DCS

results for the double ionization of H2 at an incident energy of 1099 eV and under symmetric

kinematics for the two ejected electrons, which have an identical energy of 10 eV. Both the

so-called ﬁxed ejected angle and symmetric geometry modes are investigated [10].

Atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise stated.

II. THEORY

Let us consider the dissociative double ionization reaction of the hydrogen molecule in

its electronic ground state by electron impact, i.e.,

e− + H2(1Σ+
g )

3e− + H + + H +.

→

(1)

The collision is described in the laboratory system, whose origin coincides with the center

of mass of the molecular hydrogen target, and the longitudinal z-axis is chosen parallel to the

direction of the wave vector ki of the incident electron. In the case of fast electron impact

collisions where the TEC approximation is valid (typically of the order of several keV), the

collision time is much smaller than the periods of the nuclear motions.

In addition, the

experiments of coincidence spectroscopy which have been performed so far are characterized

by a low-energy resolution. Consequently, the ionization process can be considered, to a

good approximation, as a pure electronic transition occuring at ﬁxed equilibrium internuclear

distance, ρ0, of the X 1Σ+

g electronic state of H2 [17].

Though recent ionization experiments carried out on diatomic targets have shown to

successfuly discriminate the initial orientation of the molecular target [18], the use of the

cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy techniques (COLTRIMS) in the present full

collision is for the moment unrealistic. Indeed, a quadrupole coincidence would be required

to record only those events where three electrons and one proton would be detected. As a

consequence, we consider that the distribution of the directions of the internuclear vector ρ is

isotropic and an average over all possible orientations is performed. The ﬁvefold diﬀerential

cross section, which describe the kinematically complete (e,3e) collisions in the coplanar

and both emitted electrons labelled by 1 and 2, respectively. In Eq. (2b), the electronic

As a ﬁrst approximation, the ﬁnal state wave function of the system can be expressed

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The (e,3e) ﬁvefold diﬀerential cross sections (5DCS) calculated using Eq. (13) are shown

in Figs. 2-5. Since, to our knowledge, no such experiments have been reported yet on

diatomic targets, a qualitative comparison is made with recent measurements of (e,3e) cross

sections on helium targets [10]. As the correlate motion of the two ejected electrons is taken

into account only in an approximate way (cf. Eq. (11)), our results are relative. They are

arbitrarily chosen to be renormalized to the experimental data on He, made absolute by use

of scaling factors to reproduce the theoretical convergent close-coupling calculations of the

5DCS on helium targets [23].

Throughout this study, the same kinematical conditions as in [10] are used, i.e., the impact

energy of the monokinetic electron beam is set to Ei = 1099 eV, while the fast scattered
electrons are detected with an energy Es = 1000 eV at a ﬁxed angle, θs = 1.10◦, with respect

to the reference direction of the incident beam. The momentum transfer resulting is oriented

with an angle θK =

21.6◦ and has a relatively small value, K = 0.45 a.u.

−

The ejected electrons have both an identical energy of E1 = E2 = 10 eV and their angular

distributions are investigated under both the so-called ﬁxed ejected angle and symmetric

geometry modes. In the ﬁrst detection mode, the ejection direction of one electron is chosen

6

ﬁxed, while the distribution of the second one is sampled onto the complete plane. In the

symmetric geometry mode, on the other hand, both ionized electrons emerge symmetricaly

with respect to the incident beam direction.

A. Fixed ejected angle mode

Figures 2-4 show the calculated and measured 5DCS for molecular hydrogen and helium

targets, respectively, at the ﬁxed ejection angle values, θf ix = 22.0◦, 54.0◦ and 70.0◦.

In the three situations considered, a general two-lobe structure appears in the angular

distribution of the second ejected electron. Parallel emission is forbidden due to the Pauli

principle and the Coulomb repulsion between the two electrons. Though the 5DCS corre-

sponding to the collisions on both molecular hydrogen and helium targets exhibit such a

feature, a noticeable diﬀerence is observed in both cases with respect to the type of minimum

between the two lobes. In fact, in the case of helium targets, practically a node separates

the lobes while for the double ionization reaction on molecular hydrogen targets, the 5DCS

only shows a minimum more or less pronounced. The ﬁnite intensity of the deep minimum

observed for back-to-back emission in the atomic case was attributed to non-dipolar con-

tributions [10].

In the molecular case, the minimum appears shifted with respect to the

back-to-back emission.

Moreover, important shifts are to be noted between the ejection angular distributions for

the case of helium and hydrogen targets. For instance, in the case of molecular hydrogen,

the main lobe in the forward half-plane (i.e., for

90◦ < θ < +90◦) is rotated backwards by

25◦ for θf ix = 22.0◦ (Fig. 2) and forward by

20◦ for θf ix = 54.0◦ (Fig. 3) and

∼
for θf ix = 70.0◦ (Fig. 4). The scarcity of experimental data for the lobe in the backward
half-plane (+90◦ < θ < +270◦) would make any comparison with our calculations unreliable.

∼

∼

25◦

−

Finally, one can notice the diﬀerent intensity ratios of the two lobes between experiments

on helium and the present theoretical calculations on molecular hydrogen. In particular, the

lobes for the case of experiments on helium are much more dissimilar in intensity than for

molecular hydrogen. For θf ix = 22.0◦, the intensity ratio of the forward half-plane lobe by

the backward one is just

1.5 in the case of our calculations, though it reaches

2.5 for

∼

∼

experiments on helium. This diﬀerence increases substancially for θf ix = 54.0◦, where these

ratios are

1.2 and

4.0, respectively.

∼

B. Symmetric geometry mode

In Figure 5, the theoretical 5DCS for molecular hydrogen and the measurements for

helium targets are represented for the symmetric geometry mode, where the ionized electrons

emerge symmetricaly on both sides of the incident electron beam, i.e., θ1 =

θ2. Due to

−

the symmetry of the problem, the ejection angle θ1 can be arbitrarily chosen to describe the
range 0◦ to 180◦, without any loss of generality.

As in the case of the ﬁxed ejected angle mode, both the theoretical and the measured

5DCS show a two lobe structure. The angular distribution calculated for H2 grossely re-

produces the experimental shape obtained for He, specially for the forward half-plane lobe

for 0◦ < θ1 < +90◦, with a maximum at approximatly 50◦. Nevertheless, for the second
backward peak in the region 90◦ < θ1 < 180◦, a shift amounting to up to
20◦ is observed
between the maximum of our calculations, at θ1 ∼
θ1 ∼
tion for this shift may be found in the limitation of our model which rests on the ﬁrst-order

130◦. Though this may illustrate the diﬀerent nature of the targets, the main explana-

110◦, and the experimental one, at

∼

Born series. In fact, in the same way as for (e,2e) reactions [24], second-order eﬀects strongly

characterize the angular distributions of the ejected electrons in the symmetric geometry.

Indeed, this backward peak can be interpreted as the result of an elastic backward scattering

of the projectile followed by a binary e-e collision [10]. The presence of this shift may also

be attributed partially to the crude approximation used to describe the Coulomb repulsion

of both ejected electrons in the ﬁnal channel.

Moreover, the same observation as for the ﬁxed ejected angle mode can be done relatively

to the intensity ratios of the two lobes, which are

1.3 and

2.0 for molecular hydrogen

∼

∼

and helium targets, respectively.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Theoretical ﬁvefold diﬀerential cross sections have been presented for the (e,3e) double

ionization of molecular hydrogen by fast electron impact, in the coplanar geometry, with

equal energy sharing of the two ejected electrons.

The results, obtained by extension of the analytical two-eﬀective-center (TEC) approach

for (e,2e) reactions, have been compared to experimental data available under the same

8

kinematics on double ionization of helium targets. The two detection modes investigated,

i.e., the ﬁxed ejected angle mode and the symmetric geometry mode, have revealed a general

two lobe structure for both types of targets, for the angular ranges considered. However,

qualitative diﬀerences are observed with respect to the intensity ratios of the lobes, the

nature of the minimum separating the two peaks and the positions of the maxima.

In particular, the important shift between the experimental and theoretical maxima of

the backward lobe may be attributed mainly to higher-order eﬀects, which are not taken

into account in the present theoretical treatment, and to the approximate description of

the Coulomb repulsion between both ejected electrons. In a following work, we propose to

calculate the second-order term of the Born series and to introduce the dynamic correlation

between the two slow ionized electrons by means of a more complete BBK-type description,

as indicated in expression (7), which has recently shown to signiﬁcantly improve the agree-

ment between theory and experiment for (e,2e) reactions on molecular hydrogen targets

[25].

FIG. 1: The diﬀerent position vectors of the incident and bound electrons with respect to the two

nuclei a and b.

FIG. 2: Fivefold diﬀerential cross sections (5DCS) for the (e,3e) reaction, in coplanar geometry, on

molecular hydrogen (solide line: theoretical results) and helium targets (full circles: experimental

data). The impact energy is set to Ei = 1099 eV, with a the momentum transfer K = 0.45
(θs = 1.1◦), and the two ejected electrons have equal energies E1 = E2 = 10 eV. In the ﬁxed ejected

angle mode considered, the ejection angle of the electron labelled 1 is ﬁxed at θ1 = 22.0◦, and the

angular distribution of electron 2 is sampled onto the complete plane.

FIG. 3: Same as 2 for a ﬁxed ejected angle value θs = 54.0◦

FIG. 4: Same as 2 for a ﬁxed ejected angle value θs = 70.0◦

FIG. 5: 5DCS for the (e,3e) reaction, in coplanar geometry, on molecular hydrogen (solide line:

theoretical results) and helium targets (full circles: experimental data), in the symmetric geometry

mode; both ejected electrons emerge with symmetric angles with respect to the incident beam

direction, i.e., θ1 =

θ2.

Abstract

We make a systematic study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in a He+-like model ion

when the initial states are prepared as a coherent superposition of the ground state and an excited

state. It is found that, according to the degree of the ionization of the excited state, the laser inten-

sity can be divided into three regimes in which HHG spectra exhibit diﬀerent characteristics. The

pulse-duration dependence of the HHG spectra in these regimes is studied. We also demonstrate

evident advantages of using coherent superposition state to obtain high conversion eﬃciency. The

conversion eﬃciency can be increased further if ultrashort laser pulses are employed.

INTRODUCTION

High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a very useful source of coherent light in the

extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray regions of the spectrum [1-4]. HHG occurs when atomic

systems interact with intense laser ﬁelds. There are two important aspects we need to

consider in HHG, the cutoﬀ frequency of the harmonic spectrum and the conversion eﬃciency

of the harmonic generation. The cutoﬀ frequency is predicted by the cutoﬀ law [5,6], and

the conversion eﬃciency is decided by the ionization of the atoms. Many works have been

done in increasing the cutoﬀ frequency and the conversion eﬃciency, such as by using the

ultrashort pulses [7,8]. Recently, ions have been used to extend the HHG spectrum cutoﬀ

[9-11]. However, the HHG conversion eﬃciency is usually very low because the ionization

probability is low due to the large Ip.

Increasing the harmonic conversion eﬃciency by

preparing the initial state as a coherent superposition of two bound states was ﬁrst proposed

by Gauthey et al [12]. Burnett and co-workers demonstrated that a harmonic spectrum with

distinct plateaus could be obtained by such superposition states. Ishikawa [11] showed that

the conversion eﬃciency of HHG by He+ ions can be increased eﬀectively by applying an

additional harmonic pulse to populate one of the excited states. More recently, Averbukh

[13] investigated the atomic polarization eﬀects on HHG by preparing the initial state as a

coherent superposition of one S state and one P state of atoms. The superposition state can

be obtained by multiphoton resonant excitation [14] or using one harmonic pulse with the

frequency corresponding to the energy diﬀerence between the two bound states [11] before

the fundamental laser pulse.

The idea of preparing the initial state as a coherent superposition of the ground state

and an excited state is that it can induce dipole transitions between the continuum and the

ground state via the excited state responsible for the ionization. This process depends on the

degree of the ionization of the excited state. In this paper, we will make a systematic study of

HHG with coherent superposition state in a He+-like model ion. It is found that, according

to the degree of the ionization of the excited state, the laser intensity can be divided into

three regimes in which HHG spectra exhibit diﬀerent characteristics. The pulse-duration

dependence of the HHG spectra in these regimes is studied. We also demonstrate evident

2

advantages of using coherent superposition state to obtain high conversion eﬃciency. The

conversion eﬃciency can be increased further if ultrashort laser pulses are employed.

II. NUMERICAL METHOD

Our theory is based on solving the one-dimensional time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

for a hydrogen-like ion in a laser pulse, which can be expressed as (atomic unit are used

where a and b are the parameters describing diﬀerent ions. We set a=2 and b=0.5 in order

to get the same ground state binding energy of He+ ion, i.e. 2.0 a.u., and the second excited

state binding energy is 0.53 a.u in this one-dimension case. We consider the second excited

state rather than the ﬁrst excited state because it has the same symmetry of the ground

state and has approximately the same binding energy as the ﬁrst excited state of the real

He+ ion. E(t) = F (t) sin(ωt + φ) is the electric ﬁeld of the pulse. Here, we choose ω = 0.056

(wavelength 800nm) and φ = 0 in the calculations. F (t) is the pulse envelope, which equals

sin(πt/T )2 for 10fs pulses, while

time increment the wave function is multiplied by a cos1/8 mask function that varies from 1

to 0 over a range from

III. HHG WITH COHERENT SUPERPOSITION STATE

The HHG spectrum can be obtained from the Fourier transform of the time-dependent

dipole acceleration D(t) =< ψ(x, t)

ψ(x, t) >, which can be written as:

|∇|

D(t)

< ψbound(x, t)

ψcontinuum(x, t) > +c.c..

|∇|

Here, we neglect the continuum-continuum transitions because they have no signiﬁcant

inﬂuence to harmonic generation. We prepare the initial state in a superposition of the

ground state

and some excited state denoted by

where the phase diﬀerence between the states is set to zero for simplicity. If we assume that

the ground and excited states are not coupled to any other bound state during the pulse,

then the time-dependent wave functions can be written in the form

α(t), β(t) and γk(t) are the time-dependent amplitudes of the ground, excited and continuum

states, respectively. Here, we have factorized out the energy dependence of the bare states.

Accordingly, the temporal evolution of the bound state is

(here A(t) is the vector potential of the laser pulse). Physically, Dgg(t) and Dee(t) are

simply the dipole moments one would obtain starting in the ground and excited states,

respectively. On the other hand, Dge(t) (Deg(t)) can be regarded as the interference term,

where the excited state

(the ground state

important to mention that the tunneling ionization is usually much easier for electrons at the

excite state than at the ground state. On the other hand, the probabilities of transitions from

the continuum back to the ground state is higher than that to the excited states. Speciﬁcally,
as discussed by Burnett et al. [10], we have

which equals approximately 30 in our case.

We are interested in producing high-energy harmonics photons with high conversion eﬃ-

ciency. In principle, ions can produce higher-energy harmonics due to their large ionization

potentials and higher saturation intensities because the cutoﬀ frequency equals Ip + 3.2Up.

However, harmonics signal for ions has been shown to be very weak because the eﬃciency of

the harmonic signal is directly proportional to the ionization rate. On the other hand, it is

much easier to promote the electron into the continuum from the excited state. As pointed

out by Burnett and co-workers [10], a possible way of increasing the harmonic eﬃciency is

to prepare the initial state as a coherent superposition of the ground state and an excited

state so that dipole transitions are induced between the continuum and the ground state,

where the excited state is responsible for the ionization (i.e., Dge(t) term in Eq. (9)).

Equations (7)-(10) also indicate that dipole moments are directly related to the time-

dependent amplitudes of the bound states. This is because harmonic generation originates

from the coherent dipole transition between the continuum and the bound states. As a result,

only those states that remain populated during the pulse will contribute to the harmonic

generation [17].

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We will divide the laser intensity into three regimes, according to the degree of the

ionization of the excited state. Figure 1 presents the populations of the ground and second

excited states as a function of time when the initial state is a coherent superposition of the

ground and excited states with equally weighted populations. The laser pulse duration is 10

fs and intensity is I = (a) 1

1013 W/cm2, (b) 5

1014 W/cm2 and (c) 4

1015 W/cm2.

×

×

×

In the weak-ﬁeld regime [Fig. 1(a)] there is only small transference of population from the

excited state to the continuum. In contrast, the population of the excited state decreases

signiﬁcantly within the ﬁrst two optical cycles [from 0.5 to 0.01 within 1.5 optical cycles in

Fig. 1(b)] in the intermediate-ﬁeld regime; while, in the strong-ﬁeld regime the excited state

is depleted almost completely before the peak of the laser pulse [Fig. 1(c)]. Since ionization

plays a crucial role in the generation of harmonics photons, we will demonstrate that the

HHG spectrum shows very diﬀerent characteristics in diﬀerent regimes. Furthermore, by

comparing the HHG spectra for short and long laser pulses, we ﬁnd that the spectra exhibit

distinct pulse-duration eﬀects, especially when the laser intensity is high.

A. weak-ﬁeld regime

We ﬁrst study the harmonic generation in the weak-ﬁeld regime in which there is only

small ionization of the excited state [Fig. 1(a)]. The solid curves in Fig. 2 show the HHG

spectra of He+ ion for a coherent superposition state with laser intensity 1

1013 W/cm2

×

and pulse duration (a) 10fs and (b) 100fs. For comparison, we also present results when

the initial state is the ground state (dot curve),i.e. α(0) = 1and β(0) = 0, and the second

excited state (dash curve), i.e.α(0) = 0 and β(0) = 1. We should mention that the harmonic

spectra ﬂatten out at the upper end (in ﬁgure 2, 3 and 5) is caused by the background

numerical noise, has no physical meaning, and this noise doesn’t eﬀect the spectra results.

The HHG spectra of the superposition state (solid curves) clearly shows two diﬀerent sets

of harmonics. The ﬁrst one agrees well with the spectrum of the excited state case (dash

curves), while the second one is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the

ground state case (dot curve) with the same cutoﬀ harmonic frequencies.

In the weak-ﬁeld regime, the amplitudes of the ground and excited states are approx-

6

imately constant during the laser pulse (see Fig. 1(a)). On the other hand, it is much

easier to ionize the excited state than the ground state, therefore from Eqs.(7)-(10) we have

case originate from the recombination into the ground and excited states of electrons, where

Deg(t)

. In other words, harmonics of the superposition

the excited state is responsible for the ionization. The maximum kinetic energy that the

electron brings back equals 3.17Up, therefore, when it recombines into the ground state the

energies of the emitted photons are between Ig and Ig + 3.17Up. On the other hand, recom-

bination into the excited state gives harmonics of energy between Ie and Ie + 3.17Up. The
two plateaus will be separated if Ig −
intensity that the two plateaus can be separated is lower than 1

Ie > 3.17Up. In our system the corresponding laser

1014 W/cm2.

×

We compare the HHG spectra of the short [Fig. 2(a)] and long [Fig. 2(b)] laser pulses.

For long laser pulses, a short burst of radiation emits every half a laser cycle due to the

scatter oﬀ the core of the continuum wave packet. As a result, the multi-cycle accumulation

of the harmonic generation causes separate sharp peaks in each odd harmonic order. Besides,

the harmonics is usually more intense for long laser pulses, especially in the ﬁrst plateau.

B.

intermediate-ﬁeld regime

Now, let us consider HHG in the intermediate-ﬁeld regime. Figure 3 presents the har-

monic spectra of He+ ion with laser intensity 5

1014 W/cm2 for the pulse duration (a)

×

10 fs and (b) 100 fs. The HHG spectra of the superposition case (solid curves) show only

one plateau, which is about six and ﬁve orders of magnitude higher than that of the ground

state case (dotted curve) when pulse durations are 10 fs and 100 fs, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 1(b) the population of the excited state decreases signiﬁcantly within

the ﬁrst two optical cycles in the intermediate-ﬁeld regime. Since

α(t)

time of recombination, we have from Eqs. (8) and (9)

Dge(t)

Dee(t)

|

|≫|

|

β(t)

at the

|≫|

|
. Therefore, in

|

contrast to the weak-ﬁeld case, where the recombination into the ground and excited states

gives two plateaus in the HHG spectra, the main contribution to the harmonic generation

in the intermediate-ﬁeld regime is the transition from the continuum to the ground state.

This fact is demonstrated further in Fig. 3 where the HHG spectra of the superposition case

(solid curves) is about three and two orders of magnitude higher than that of the excited

state case (dashed curves) when pulse durations are 10 fs and 100 fs, respectively.

7

We are interested in producing harmonic photons with high conversion eﬃciency, which

is directly proportional to the population of the continuum and the remain population of

the bound states.

In the intermediate-ﬁeld regime, the laser intensity is high enough to

ionize the excited state within a few optical cycles, while too weak to directly ionize the

ground state. Therefore, if the initial state is prepared as a coherent superposition of the

ground state and an excited state, a large dipole transitions will be induced between the

continuum and the ground state, where the excited state is responsible for the ionization.

In our system the intermediate-ﬁeld regime are from I

1014 W/cm2 to about 1

1015

W/cm2. Moreover, Fig. 4 presents the temporal behavior of the harmonics of the 71th

(dashed curve) and 91th (solid curve) harmonic order for the superposition case when the

laser intensity is 5

1014 W/cm2. It shows that harmonic photons emit mainly during the

×

ﬁrst few optical cycles in which the excited state ionizes eﬃciently. As a result, conversion

eﬃciency can be increased further if short laser pulses are employed. For example, the HHG

of 10 fs pulse is on an average one order of magnitude higher than that of the 100 fs pulse.

Finally, as shown in Fig. 3(b) the HHG spectrum of the excited state case (dashed

curve) exhibits two plateaus with the second cutoﬀ consistent with that of the ground

state case (dotted curve) when the laser pulse duration is 100 fs. This is because under

the intermediate laser power, there is population transfer from the excited to the ground

states via multiphoton transition. Therefore, dipole transitions can be induced between the

continuum and the ground state, even the atoms are initially in the excited state.

C.

strong-ﬁeld regime

We increase the laser intensity further to a point that there is a signiﬁcant population de-

pletion of the excited state within one optical cycle, and study how this population depletion

aﬀects the HHG spectra. Figure 5 presents the HHG spectra of He+ ion with I = 4

1015

W/cm2 for the pulse duration (a) 10 fs and (b) 100 fs when the initial states are superposi-

×

tion state (solid curve), ground state (dotted curve) and excited state (dashed curve). Let

us ﬁrst consider the HHG spectra with short pulse duration (Fig. 5(a)). It is found that

the spectrum of the ground state case (dotted curve) exhibits a double-plateau structure.

To understand this, we perform a wavelet time-frequency analysis [18] of the spectral and

temporal structures of HHG. Figure 6(a) presents the time proﬁle of the harmonics when

8

the initial states is the ground state. It indicates that the cutoﬀ at about 551th harmonic

emits at time around 1.8 optical cycle. On the other hand, there are at least four trajecto-

ries, which contribute to the harmonics below the 431th harmonic order, leading to another

plateau with higher strength.

We then consider the excited state case [dashed curve in Fig. 5(a)]. At intensity I =

1015 W/cm2 the excited state decreases from 0.5 to 0.01 within about 0.7 optical cycles

4

×

[Fig. 1(c)]. As a consequence, the cutoﬀ frequency (at about 351th harmonic order) is much

smaller than that predicted by the three-step model, which equals 521th harmonic order

according to the Ip + 3.17Up law, because the excited state is depleted almost completely

before the peak of the laser pulse. Moreover, in contrast to the previous cases, the high

depletion of the excited state also causes the harmonic intensity of the excited state case

much lower than that of the ground state case because

α(t)

β(t)

most of the time

|

|≫|

|

[see Eqs. (7) and (8)].

Now, we consider the spectrum of the superposition case [solid curve in Fig. 5(a)],

which exhibits a complex structure with three plateaus. The ﬁrst plateau is about two

orders of magnitude higher than that of the ground state case, while the other part of the

spectrum agrees well with that of the ground state case. Physically, the HHG spectrum

of the superposition case has two contributions: One originates from the dipole moment

Dgg(t), which gives spectrum above the 375th harmonic order and is consistent with that

part of the ground state case. On the other hand, the ﬁrst plateau in the spectrum is due to

the interference term Dge(t). The strength of this plateau is about two orders of magnitude

higher than that of the ground state case because of the large transition from the excited state

to the continuum, demonstrating once again the advantages of using coherent superposition

state to obtain high conversion eﬃciency. Also, from the wavelet time-frequency analysis

[Fig, 6(b)] we ﬁnd that harmonics at the cutoﬀ of this plateau emit at time around 1.4

optical cycle.

Finally, we consider the HHG spectra of the long pulse duration case [Fig. 5(b)]. First,

there is almost no harmonic generation for the excited state case (dashed curve) because

the excited state is depleted almost completely within one optical cycle. Second, since there

is an eﬀective transition from the ground state to the continuum while very little depletion

of the ground state population, the conversion eﬃciency of the ground state case (dotted

curve) is relatively high. Finally, the excited state plays no role in the harmonic generation

9

when the laser has long pulse duration, as a result, the HHG spectrum of the superposition

case (solid curve) is consistent with that of the ground state case. It is worth mentioning

that, in the strong-ﬁeld regime, there is no advantage of using short pulse. In contrast, the

multi-cycle accumulation causes the conversion eﬃciency of the long pulse higher than that

of the short pulse by about three orders of magnitude when the initial state is the ground

state.

V. CONCLUSION

There are two factors which can aﬀect the conversion eﬃciency of HHG, i.e., the ionization

rate of the initial bound states and the remained populations of the bound states at the time

of recombination. The advantage of using coherent superposition state is that it is possible

to induce dipole transitions between the continuum and the ground state, where the excited

state is responsible for the ionization, thus, drastically increases the conversion eﬃciency.

In this paper, we make a systematic study of HHG in a He+-like model ion when the

initial states are prepared as a coherent superposition of the ground state and an excited

state. Since the ionization plays the crucial role in the HHG with coherent initial state,

the laser intensity is divided into three regimes according to the degree of the ionization of

the excited state. The HHG spectra exhibit diﬀerent characteristics in these regimes. We

have demonstrated evident advantages of using coherent superposition state to obtain high

conversion eﬃciency. We have also found distinct pulse-duration eﬀects in the intermediate-

and strong-ﬁeld regimes.

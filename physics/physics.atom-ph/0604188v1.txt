Enhanced eﬀect of temporal variation of the ﬁne structure constant and strong
interaction in 229Th

(Dated: February 21, 2014)
The relative eﬀects of variation of the ﬁne structure constant α = e2/¯hc and dimensionless strong
interaction parameter mq/ΛQCD are enhanced 5-6 orders of magnitude in very narrow ultraviolet
transition between the ground and ﬁrst excited state in 229Th nucleus (energy (3.5 ± 1) eV). Cor-
responding experiment has potential of improving sensitivity to the variation of the fundamental
constants by 7-10 orders of magnitude (up to 10

−23 per year).

PACS numbers: 06.20.Jr , 42.62.Fi , 23.20.-g
Uniﬁcation theories applied to cosmology suggest a
possibility of variation of the fundamental constants in
the expanding Universe (see e.g. review [1]). There are
hints of variation of α and mq,e/ΛQCD in quasar absorp-
tion spectra, Big Bang nucleosynthesis and Oklo natural
nuclear reactor data (see [2] and references therein). Here
ΛQCD is the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) scale, and
mq and me are the quark and electron masses. However,
the majority of publications report only limits on possi-
ble variations (see e.g. reviews [1, 3]). A very sensitive
method to study the variation in a laboratory consists of
the comparison of diﬀerent optical and microwave atomic
clocks (see recent measurements in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).
An enhancement of the relative eﬀect of α variation can
be obtained in a transition between almost degenerate
levels in Dy atom [16]. These levels move in opposite
directions if α varies. An experiment is currently under-
way to place limits on α variation using this transition
[17], but unfortunately one of the levels has quite a large
linewidth and this limits the accuracy. An enhancement
of 1-3 orders exists in narrow microwave molecular tran-
sitions [18]. Some atomic transitions with enhanced sen-
sitivity are listed in Ref. [19].

A very narrow level (3.5±1) eV above the ground state
exists in 229Th nucleus [11] (in [12] the energy is (3.67 ±
0.03) eV). The width of this level is estimated to be about
10−4 Hz [13] (the experimental limits on the width are
given in [14]). This makes 229Th a possible reference for
an optical clock of very high accuracy, and opens a new
possibility for a laboratory search for the varitation of the
fundamental constants [15]. Below I will show that there
is an additional very important advantage. The relative
eﬀects of variation of α and mq/ΛQCD are enhanced by
5-6 orders of magnitude.

The ground state of 229Th nucleus is J P [N nzΛ] =
5/2+[633]; i.e. the deformed oscillator quantum numbers
are N = 6, nz = 3, the projection of the valence neutron
orbital angular momentum on the nuclear symmetry axis
(internal z-axis) is Λ = 3, the spin projection Σ = −1/2,
and the total angular momentum and the total angular
momentum projection are J = Ω = Λ+Σ = 5/2. The 3.5
eV excited state is J P [N nzΛ] = 3/2+[631]; i.e. it has the
same N = 6 and nz = 3. The values Λ = 1, Σ = 1/2 and
J = Ω = 3/2 are diﬀerent. The energy of both states may

be described by an equation [20] E = E0 + CΛΣ + DΛ2,
i.e. the energy diﬀerence between the excited and ground
state is ω = Ee − Eg = 2C − 8D. The values of the con-
stants C and D are presented, for example, in the book
[20]. Note that ω is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than C
and D. Therefore, for consistency of this simple valence
model, we must take 2C ≈ 8D. Based on the data from
[20] we will use the following numbers: 2C ≈ 8D ≈ −1.4
MeV. The relative variation of the transition frequency
may be presented as

δω
ω

=

δ(2C) − δ(8D)
ω

≈ 0.4 · 106(

(1)

The large factor here appeared from the ratio 2C/ω ≈
8D/ω ≈ −0.4 · 106. The orbit-axis interaction constant
D vanishes for zero deformation parameter β2. There-
fore, we should assume that D ≈ const · V0β2 where V0 is
the depth of the strong potential. The nuclear deforma-
tion reduces the energy of the Coulomb repulsion between
the protons. Without this repulsion the deformation pa-
rameter β2 would probably be zero [21]. Therefore, it is
natural to assume that β2 ≈ const · α. Thus we have
D ≈ const · V0 · α and

To estimate variation of V0 we will use Walecka model

Here r0= 1.2 fm is an inter-nucleon distance. Note that
the nuclear potential in this model is a highly tuned small
diﬀerence of two large terms. Therefore, the contribution
of the variation of r0 is not as important as the contribu-
tion of the meson mass variation which is enhanced due
to the cancellation of two terms in V0. The result is [23]

The ﬁnal result will depend on the variation of the di-
mensionless parameter mq/ΛQCD. During the following
calculations, we shall assume that ΛQCD does not vary
and so we shall speak about the variation of masses (this
means that we measure masses in units of ΛQCD). We
shall restore the explicit appearance of ΛQCD in the ﬁ-
nal answers. The dependence of the meson masses on the
current light quark mass mq = (mu +md)/2 has been cal-

Kq=0.045 and Ks=0.19 in Refs. [23, 27],Kq=0.037 and
Ks=0.011 in Ref.
[25]. All
three values of Kq are close to the average value Kq=0.05.
However, diﬀerent methods of calculations give very dif-
ferent values of Ks. Fortunetely, this is not important
since the strange mass dependense of σ-meson is much
stronger than that of proton (due to the SU(3) symme-
try σ contains valence ¯ss pair, another factor is strong
repulsion of σ from the close K +K −, ¯K 0K 0, ηη states
[23]), also there is the “cancellation” enhancement of the
σ contribution to D. As a result we have

The relatively small contribution of the light quark mass
is explained by the fact that mq ≈ 5 MeV is very small.
The contribution of the strange quark mass ms ≈ 120

The reason for the enhancement here (∼ 5 times) is the
cancellation of the σ and ω meson contributions to V0
(see eq. (4)) which appears in the denominator of the
V0 + .... However, the
relative variation of D:
σ and ω mesons contribute with equal sign to the spin-
orbit interaction constant C [26]. Therefore, there is no
“cancellation” enhancement here. However, there is an-
other eﬃcient mechanism. The spin-orbit interaction is
inversely proportional to the nucleon mass MN squared,
C ∝ 1/M 2
. The nucleon mass depends
on the quark masses:

where Xq = mq/ΛQCD and Xs = ms/ΛQCD. Thus we
have here ﬁve to six orders enhancement in the relative
variation of the transition frequency. Another advantage
is that the width of this nuclear transition is several or-
ders of magnitude smaller than a typical atomic clock
width (∼ Hz). Current atomic clocks limits on the varia-
tion of the fundamental constants are approaching 10−15
per year. With these two enhancement factors the result
for 229Th may be 7-10 orders of magnitude better. We
conclude that this nuclear transition has an enormous
potential for a laboratory search for the variation of the
fundamental constants.

[21] In principle, the shell eﬀect may also produce some small
non-zero deformation. Therefore, we should write β2 =
c0 + c1 · α + c2 · α2.... However, 229Th is not so far from
the area of spherical nuclei and the linear term must be
important. This justiﬁes our estimate.

ABSTRACT: The constraints imposed by symmetry on the open channels
of dipositronium has been studied, and the symmetry-adapted lowest open
channel of each quantum state has been identiﬁed. Based on this study, the
existence of two more 0+ bound states has been theoretically conﬁrmed, and
a 0+ narrow resonance has been predicted. A variational calculation has
been performed to evaluate the critical strength of the repulsive interaction
. Two 0− states are found to have their critical strengths very close to 1,
they are considered as candidates of new narrow resonances or loosely bound
states .

1, INTRODUCTION

Since positrons can be easily created in the processes of high energy
collisions, the molecules formed by electrons and positrons are believed to
exist in nature. Half a century ago the existence of the positronium molecule,
namely the dipositronium Ps2 . has already been predicted1 and has been
ﬁrstly calculated via a variational procedure2. Since the lifetime of the ground
state of Ps2 is very short (it is only 0.906ns3) due to the e−-e+ annihilation, it
has not yet been observed experimentally. In recent years this problem has
attracted increasing attention following the ability to create cold positron
beams tunable over a wide energy range4, and the increasing ability to carry
out accurate theoretical calculations 3,5−10. In addition to the ground state,
an angular momentum L=1 and parity Π = −1 bound excited state has also
been predicted10. The other excited states are believed to be resonances.

Of course any resonance would collapse via at least one open chan-
nels. However, whether a state is allowed to enter into an open channel is not
only determined by energy but also by symmetry.
In fact, as we shall see,
the states with a speciﬁc set of quantum numbers are allowed by symmetry
to get access to only a few speciﬁc open channels. Thus, for a given state, it
is important to make sure which open channel is the lowest one allowed by
symmetry, this is called a symmetry-adapted lowest open channel (SLOC).
If a state has its energy lower than the SLOC, it would be deﬁnitely bound

1

because it has no channel to collapse. If a state has its energy a little higher
than the SLOC and if there is a barrier to hinder the wave function from
leaking into the channel, it would appear as a narrow resonance. The barrier
may have diﬀerent origin, what is concerned here is the centrifugal barrier as
discussed later. If the barrier does not exist or if the energy is much higher
than the SLOC, the state would be a broad resonance. When a resonance has
a very broad width, it is very diﬃcult to be detected, and thus the existence
of this resonance is meaningless. In other words, only the resonances with
narrower widths are interesting.

The main aim of this paper is the identiﬁcation of the SLOC, this
is the base for the further study of the dipositronium. Additionally, based
on the SLOC and on other existing data, the existence of a few more bound
states and resonances has been conﬁrmed. Furthermore, a few candidates of
bound states or resonances has been suggested based on an evaluation. The
emphasis is placed on the qualitative aspect.

which is invariant with respect to the O3 group and to the point group
D2d.3 The latter is a subgroup of S4 containing eight elements, namely 1,
p12, p34, p12p34, p13p24, p14p23, pc(1324), and pc(1423) (where pij denotes
an interchange and pc(ijkl) denotes a cyclic permutation). Hence the eigen-
states can be classiﬁed according to the irreducible representations of the O3
and D2d , and thereby can be denoted as LΠ(µ), where µ denotes a repre-
sentation of the D2d group, µ = A1, A2, B1, B2 or E. Let the wave function
of a LΠ(µ) state be denoted as ΨLΠµ. From the knowledge of the D2d group,
we have2

p12p34 ΨLΠµ = ΨLΠµ (if µ 6= E), or = − ΨLΠµ (if µ = E)
and
p13p24 ΨLΠµ = ΨLΠµ (if µ = A1 or B1), or = − ΨLΠµ (if µ = A2 or B2)

Let the spins of the two electrons 1 and 2 be coupled to S1, those of 3
and 4 be coupled to S2. Obviously, eq.(2) implies that the states with µ 6= E
have S1 = S2 .

On the other hand, let Φnl denotes an eigenstate of the positronium

2

Ps ( the ground state has (nl) = (10) ). For the Ps2 →Ps + Ps dissociation
channel (where the Ps may be excited), The channel wave function Ψch can
be written as

Ψch = (1+(−1)S1p12)(1+(−1)S2p34)[(Φnl(r13)Φn′l′(r24))loflR(r13,24)]L
where flR is the wave function of relative motion and lR is the relative
l and l′ are coupled to lo, together with lR they are

coupled to L. From (4) we have

p13p24Ψch = (−1)l+l′

(1+(−1)S2p12)(1+(−1)S1p34)[(Φnl(r13)Φn′l′(r24))loflR(r13,24)]L

(5)

as

Furthermore, in the special case of (nl) = (n′l′) , eq.(4) can be rewritten

Ψch = (1 + (−1)S1+S2+lo+lR){[(Φnl(r13)Φnl(r24))loflR(r13,24)]L
+(−1)S1[(Φnl(r23)Φnl(r14))loflR(r23,14)]L}

(6)

Evidently, if a LΠ(µ) state is allowed to enter into a speciﬁc Ps + Ps

channel, the associated Ψch must have the same (L, Π, µ) symmetry.

As examples, let us ﬁrst study the 0−(A1) and 0−(B1) states. From

eq.(3) we have

(7.1)

p13p24Ψch = Ψch
Since the µ = A1 or B1 states have S1 = S2, eq.(5) can be rewritten as
p13p24Ψch = (−1)l+l′
Comparing eq.(7.1) with (7.2), we have
(−1)l+l′
(8.1)
Furthermore, since we have meanwhile S1 = S2, the factor (1+(−1)S1+S2+lo+lR)

(7.2)

Ψch

= 1

in eq.(6) is nonzero only if lR + lo is even. Thus we have

(-1)lo+lR =1, if (nl) = (n′l′)
(8.2)
Besides, it can be proved that none of the partial waves of a 0− state can
be zero. The proof is as follows. Let the angular momenta corresponding to
the three Jacobian vectors ra, rb, and rc be denoted as l1, l2, and l3 . For 0−
states, any relative partial wave, say l1, can not be zero. If l1 were zero,
l2 must be equal to l3 to assure L=0. However, if l2= l3 , the parity must
be even. Therefore l1 (or any relative angular momentum) is not allowed to
be zero in 0− states. Evidently, the proof
is valid for any set of Jacobian
coordinates. Thus we have
l 6= 0, l′ 6= 0, and lR 6= 0
Deﬁnitely, a Ps+Ps channel is accessible to the 0−(A1) or 0−(B1) states
only if (8.1) to (8.3) are satisﬁed. Due to these constraints, the lowest Ps
+ Ps channel is the one having (nl) = (n′l′) = (21) , and lR = 1 . This

(8.3)

3

channel is labeled as (21) p(21), where p denotes the relative p-wave of the
two excited positronium, the associated threshold energy is -0.1250 (a.u. are
used in this paper).

For the 0−(A2) and 0−(B2) states, the constraint eq.(8.1) should
be changed to (-1)l+l′
= -1 ( thus lR is even), while the constraints (8.2)
and (8.3) remain unchanged. Accordingly the lowest Ps+Ps channel is the
(21) d(32) channel at -0.090278. From a similar deduction, we know that
the lowest Ps+Ps channels for the 0−(E) states are the (21) d(32) channel
and the (21) p(31) channel both at -0.090278.

Let us inspect another 2-body channel, the Ps− + e+ (or Ps+ + e− )
channel. It is recalled that the Ps− has only one bound state with angular
momentum zero. Thus, if a 0−(µ) state entered into this channel, lR must be
zero to assure L=0. However, lR = 0 is prohibited due to eq.(8.3). Therefore
the Ps− + e+ channel is not accessible to the 0−(µ) states.

Let us inspect the Ps +e+ + e− 3-body channel. Let l be the an-
gular momentum of the Ps. Since l = 0 is not allowed due to eq.(8.3), The
positronium in the 3-body channel of 0− states must be excited, therefore
the lowest Ps +e+ + e− 3-body channel is at -0.0625 (in which the Ps has
(nl) = (21)).

The above analysis is straight forward to be generalized and thereby
all the SLOC can be identiﬁed as listed in Table 1 ( the states having suﬃcient
data from existing theoretical calculations are listed in this table) and Table

(A) Conﬁrmation of new bound states and resonance
Among the states of Table 1, the 0+(A1) and 1−(B2) have already
been pointed out that they are bound.3,10 For the 0+(B2) and 0+(E) states,
they are tentatively classiﬁed as resonant singlet and triplet spin state in the
ﬁrst paper of ref. 7, and are believed to be metastable or resonance states
in ref.3. Now, it is clear that these two states have their energies lower than
their thresholds, thus they are deﬁnitely bound.

For the 0+(A2) state, its energy is only a little higher than the thresh-
old. Furthermore, the lowest partial wave for the relative motion of the two

5

dissociating positroniums is p−wave as shown in Table 1. Thus a centrifugal
barrier exists to hinder the wave function from leaking out. It is recalled that
the height of the centrifugal barrier of the Ps + Ps channel is lR(lR+1)/(2r2
ch),
where rch is roughly the sum of the radii of the two projectiles ( a positro-
nium in the ground state and the other one in the (21) excited state), and
therefore would be in the order of 10 . Accordingly the height of the barrier
would be in the order of 0.01 for p−wave. On the other hand, the energy of
the 0+(A2) is only higher than the threshold by 0.0004.3 Thus the barrier is
suﬃciently high to hinder the wave function, and therefore we believe that
the width of the 0+(A2) resonance is very narrow. For the 0+(B1) state, its
energy is also only a little higher than the threshold. However, the lowest
partial wave for the dissociation is s−wave, thus centrifugal barrier does not
exist, and therefore the 0+(B1) is a broad resonance diﬃcult to detect.

(B) Candidates of new bound states and resonances

In order to evaluate the eigenenergies of the states in Table 2, a
set of basis functions is introduced for the diagonalization of the Hamil-

tonian.
general not appropriate for Coulomb systems, the main shortcoming is their
inappropriate asymptotic behavior. However, if several set of h.o.
states
with diﬀerent widths are used together, this shortcoming can be remarkably
cured11. For example, let ϕωK
nl be the eigenstate of a single-particle pure
harmonic oscillation with the width ωK , eigenenergy (2n + l + 3/2)¯hωK and
angular momentum l¯h . When ﬁve sets of ϕωK
nl are used together (i.e., ωK
has ﬁve choices), and n ≤ 3 is assumed for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian
of a hydrogen atom, the resultant lowest energies for l = 0, 1,and 2 states
are -0.499987, -0.124998, and -0.055554, respectively, to be compared with
the exact values -0.5, -0.125, and -0.055556. Therefore, we believed that, if
only bound states are taken into account, and if only the qualitative aspect
is concerned, several sets of h.o. states together can be used for our limited
purpose.

Besides, a subsidiary procedure is needed to extract a new set {Ψi} from
the old sets, so that the Ψi are orthonormalized. The total number of Ψi
used for the diagonalization is determined by Nmax which is the maximum of
the sum 2(n1+n2+n3)+l1+l2+l3 . As examples, when Nmax=23, the number
of Ψi for the 0−(A1) and 0−(B1) states are 6655 and 7824 respectively.

the attractive interactions remain unchanged. Such an adjustment does not
change the threshold energies of the Ps+Ps channels. It is emphasized that
the introduction of λ does not at all alter the symmetry of the Hamiltonian,
it remains to be invariant with respect to O3 and D2d . Therefore the nature
of the problem is not altered. Of course, what we really concern is the case
with λ close to 1.

r34

Let the lowest eigenenergy of a given (LΠµ) symmetry be denoted
as E(λ). Then, our procedure is ﬁrstly to choose a λ smaller than one so
that E(λ) is lower than the threshold of the SLOC. For an example, for the
0−(B1) state, when λ = 0.95, we have E(λ) = −0.1282 which is lower than
the SLOC at -0.1250. Secondly, λ is increased step by step (in each step λ
is increased by 0.01). When λ is equal to a value λo so that E(λo) is lower
than while E(λo + 0.01) is higher than the threshold, then the procedure
stops and λo is call a critical strength.
In this way mainly bound states are
concerned in the calculation. Evidently, if a state has a λo much larger than
one, it is deeply bound. If λo is a little larger than one, it is just bound and
a little lower than the dissociation threshold. If λo is a little smaller than
one, it is a resonance a little higher than the threshold. If λo is remarkably
smaller than one, the state is a high-lying resonance with a broad width, and
we will neglect it.

To show the convergency of our calculation, the eigenenergies of se-
lected states are listed at the last column of Table 1 (with λ = 1). Besides,

7

two series of eigenenergies are given in Table 3 in accord with Nmax . Ow-
ing to the diﬃculty in calculation, the basis functions with Nmax¿23 are not
adopted. The above results exhibit that the speed of convergency is not
good, thus the calculated energies would not be useful if we want to know
the exact locations of the levels (this is an eﬀort beyond the aim and scope
of this paper). However, if we just want to know which levels are relatively
closer to their SLOC, then our results are useful.

The numerical results of λo are summarized in Table 2. In this table
most λo are remarkably smaller than one, the associated states are broad
resonances and will not be further discussed. However, there are two and
only two states, namely the 0−(E) and 0−(B1) , have their λo very close to
one. They are distinguished from the others. Since, as mentioned before, all
the calculated energies are a little higher than the actual values, the actual
critical strength λactual will be a little larger than the λo listed in the table.
Thus, the λactual of the 0−(E) and 0−(B1) will be in fact very close to one
or even larger. Furthermore, the open channels of these two states have lR
to be p−wave or higher, thus a centrifugal barrier exists. Therefore, among
all the other states, these two states are candidates, they are either narrow
resonances or bound states. If they are resonances, the 0−(E) would emerge
when two excited positroniums collide with each other (via the (21) p(31)
or (21) d(32) channel). Similarly, the 0−(B1) would emerge in the collision
via the (21) p(21) channel. Once they are created, they are free from direct
annihilation.12 They would collapse either via their channel of formation, or
would be transformed to a lower broad resonance via an E1 transition (the
0−(E) would then become a 1+(E), and the 0−(B1) become a 1+(A2)), and
then collapse via the (10) p(21) channel. Anyway, during the decay of these
resonances, low-energy photons (from the above E1 transition and from the
transition of an excited positronium to its ground state) can be detected.
These low-energy photons would help the identiﬁcation of these states.

4, FINAL REMARKS

In conclusion, the main outcome of this paper is the identiﬁcation of
the SLOC of dipositronium. The identiﬁcation is proved to be very useful to

8

the analysis of the existing data. Speciﬁcally, in addition to the two bound
states that have been found previously, two more 0+ bound states have been
identiﬁed, and a 0+ narrow resonances has been predicted. Furthermore, two
0− states are found to have their energies very close to their SLOC (while
the others are remarkably higher). Besides, their SLOC contain centrifugal
barrier. Thus they are either narrow resonances or loosely bound states.
Since our calculation is not accurate enough, what they really are remains
to be identiﬁed . Undoubtedly, the ﬁnal identiﬁcation of these two states is
an attractive theoretical topic. In the experimental aspect, the search of the
0+(A2) resonance via the collision taking place in the (10) p(21) channel is
ﬁrstly recommended, because its width is very narrow.

As a summary, a primary spectrum of dipositronium is proposed as

shown in Table 4, where at least four bound states have been identiﬁed.

The above procedure is mainly based on symmetry consideration, the
way of analysis can be generalized to study other molecules with symmetries
other than O3 and D2d.
In particular, the identiﬁcation of the SLOC is
important to the study of resonances of various molecules.

12, When only the two-photon process is assumed, the probability of
annihilation is proportional to the probability of overlap of an electron with
a positron hδ(re+−re−)i. If this quantity is zero, the associated state is free
from direct annihilation. On the other hand, it has been stated in the text
that s-partial wave is not allowed in 0− states. However, wave function of any
partial wave must be zero at r=0, except the s-wave. Thus, the prohibition
of the s-partial wave leads to hδ(re+−re−)i=0 and therefore the 0− states
are free from direct annihilation.

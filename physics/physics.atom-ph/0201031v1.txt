Abstract

A family of orbiting resonances in molecular scattering is globally described by using a

single pole moving in the complex angular momentum plane. The extrapolation of this pole

at negative energies gives the location of the bound states. Then a single pole trajectory, that

connects a rotational band of bound states and orbiting resonances, is obtained. These complex

angular momentum singularities are derived through a geometrical theory of the orbiting. The

downward crossing of the phase–shifts through π/2, due to the repulsive region of the molecular

potential, is estimated by using a simple hard–core model. Some remarks about the diﬀerence

between diﬀracted rays and orbiting are also given.

Introduction

After a long search, about two decades ago it became possible to observe orbiting resonances (or

quasi–bound states) in molecular beam scattering [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Although these phenomena can

be quite naturally interpreted in the framework of scattering theory [6], their semiclassical nature

calls for a more reﬁned analysis, mainly geometrical, which has been partially performed by several

authors, and notably by Berry [7, 8, 9]. In this spirit, it has been also advocated the use of the

complex angular momentum plane polology, especially by Bosanac [10, 11, 12], Connor [13, 14]

and Nussenzveig (see in particular his book [15] and the references quoted therein). In the latter

approach, however, some problems remain, and a detailed phenomenological analysis is in part still

missing.

In the standard complex angular momentum approach one generally considers a given class

of potentials, and then explores the analytical properties of the partial–waves along with their

asymptotic behaviour in the complex angular momentum plane. If these analytical properties and

1

E. De Micheli, G.A. Viano – Jan 11/02

2

asymptotic behaviours allow for using the Watson transformation [16], then a resummation of the

partial wave expansion can be performed, and the total scattering amplitude can be represented

in terms of poles along with a background integral. The main limit of this method consists in

the fact that it works only for a rather restricted class of potentials, notably for the Yukawian

class [17], which is not very important in molecular scattering. Nussenzveig [18, 19, 20], in a

series of very signiﬁcant papers, extended the complex angular momentum method with particular

attention to optical problems. In this context, the hard–core potential has been treated in detail,

and, in addition to the Watson resummation, also the Poisson transformation has been used (see

also Ref. [9]). The latter seems to be more promising for semiclassical scattering theories like the

one that is of interest in the present paper. However, it must be noted that molecular scattering

is usually described in terms of Lennard–Jones or Morse–type potential [21]; it is worth reminding
that singular potentials of the type g2r−n, n > 2, present an inﬁnite number of poles in the ﬁrst

quadrant of the complex angular momentum plane, and, in such a situation, one is forced to use a

modiﬁed Watson transformation. As far as we know, this approach has been rigorously proved in
the case g2r−4 by Dombey and Jones [22], and then conjectured for g2r−n, n > 4. Furthermore,

several authors, and notably those from the Uppsala school [23, 24, 25], have applied the phase–

integral method to derive locations and residues of the poles in the complex angular momentum
plane, for singular potentials of the form V (r) = g2r−nf (r), (n

4). It should be noted that the

primary goal of all these researches consists in substituting to the partial–wave expansion, in a

≥

region where it is slowly convergent, more rapidly convergent representations. The latter then split

the scattering amplitude into a sum of pole contributions and one or more integral terms which are

usually evaluated by means of the saddle point method.

Our viewpoint is quite diﬀerent. We think that also in the region where only one partial–wave

is dominant a complex angular momentum representation can be useful if we want to interpolate

the various orbiting resonances with a single moving pole, whose extrapolation at negative energies

can then give the bound states. With this in mind, we focus our attention on the poles of the

scattering amplitude in the complex angular momentum plane, and we neglect, to a certain extent,

the background integral, as will be explained below. To this purpose, a geometrical method of

derivation of the complex angular momentum poles is implemented: instead of studying the ana-

lytical and asymptotic properties of the partial–waves for a speciﬁc class of potentials, we analyze

the particle motion (and speciﬁcally the orbiting) in a Riemannian space whose metric is induced

by the potential.

In view of the fact that we are treating a semiclassical scattering problem, the concept of particle

path (or trajectory) still conserves its meaning. We are therefore allowed to study the geodesics
(i.e., the particle paths) in a space whose Riemannian metric is given by n2 dxi dxj, n2 = 1
V /E,
E being the energy and V the potential. The coordinates xi require a more detailed comment: in
fact, one generally claims to solve the dynamical problem in the whole space R3 by using a unique

−

coordinate system for all the points of the space being considered. Here we prefer to introduce

E. De Micheli, G.A. Viano – Jan 11/02

3

local coordinates that are appropriate to describe locally the particle trajectories, and then to

use diﬀerent coordinate systems elsewhere in space. We are thus led to consider the Jacobian

of the transformation connecting the local coordinates to the ambient space coordinates. The

transformation is singular in those domains where the Jacobian vanishes. We can then work out

the problem by means of two geometrical tools: geodesics, which describe locally the particle paths,

and Jacobians. The global solution emerges by patching up geodesic segments which represent local

solutions. We will show in section 2 that by the sole use of these geometrical ingredients is possible

to obtain a representation of the scattering amplitude in terms of complex angular momentum

plane singularities (poles).

However, this representation is not complete, and can only be regarded as an approximation;

in what follows we shall discuss pro and con of this representation. First of all we obtain an an-

gular distribution in terms of Legendre functions (not polynomials) of complex index, that present

a logarithmic singularity forwards (i.e., at null scattering angle). This fact suggests that a com-

pensating background term is missing in a representation which uses only poles. However, it is

possible to project the scattering amplitude (represented only by poles) on the partial–waves, and

the result can be regarded as a faithful representation, at least for angular momentum suﬃciently

small. Furthermore, the consequent integral (total) cross–section is ﬁnite, since the singularity of

the Legendre functions involved is only logarithmic. On the other hand, the advantage of this

representation is that the entire sequence of orbiting resonances can be ﬁtted by using a single

pole. The latter, while moving as a function of the energy, is able to describe in an ordered way

the passage of the phase–shifts of various angular momenta through π/2, that is the value of the

phase–shifts corresponding to the resonances. Therefore, a global view and explanation of the

orbiting resonances is obtained.

Furthermore, these moving poles produce bound–states at those values of the energy where

the angular momentum (which is real at negative energy) takes integer values. We thus obtain a

trajectory of the complex angular momentum pole as a function of the energy, which gives bound–

states at negative energy and resonances at positive energy. Obviously, the bound–states are not

observed directly by scattering experiments. Their existence is, however, revealed by the fact that

the phase–shift δl at zero–energy is given by nlπ (as explained by the generalized Levinson theorem)
where nl is the number of bound–states with angular momentum equal to l (see refs. [26, 27], and
sections 3 and 4). These non–resonating phase–shifts decrease at higher energy passing through

π/2 in downward direction. This downward crossing of π/2 does not correspond to a resonance,

but it is rather due to a repulsive potential. We can, however, ﬁt this part of the phase–shifts by

regarding them as the ones produced by a repulsive hard–core in a sense that will be explained in

detail in section 3.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we outline a geometric theory of the orbiting, and

obtain an approximate representation of the scattering amplitude in terms of moving poles (complex

angular momentum poles). In section 3 we derive a ﬁtting formula for the phase–shifts that accounts

E. De Micheli, G.A. Viano – Jan 11/02

also for the role of the non–resonating phase–shifts. Section 4 is devoted to the phenomenological

analysis. Finally, in section 5 we draw some conclusions, and brieﬂy discuss the diﬀerence between

orbiting and diﬀracted rays, and, accordingly, between resonances and diﬀraction.

there is no attenuation in the ray tube intensity. The angular coordinates used are θ and φ and, for
the sake of simplicity, we set the radius of the orbit to 1; then we have: g11 = 1, g22 = sin2 θ, g12 =

u(θ, k) =

(θ

= nπ, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .),

(12)

where the terms e±ikθ represent waves traveling in counterclockwise sense (eikθ) or in clockwise sense
(e−ikθ). At this point let us note that approximation (12) fails at θ = nπ (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .):

i.e.,

this approximation is not uniform. In particular, we are obliged to ﬁnd the connection formulae

relating the traveling waves when they cross the antipodal points θ = 0, and θ = π. These

connection formulae can be established by the use of the Maslov indexes. Here we simply give the

results (the interested reader is referred to refs. [28, 29]):

Therefore, for each complete tour, both the counterclockwise and the clockwise oriented rays cross

the antipodal points θ = 0 and θ = π, and accordingly, in both cases the amplitude acquires a

factor (

1).

We have seen that at the antipodal points the amplitude becomes inﬁnite if we use the θ–

representation. But in the Maslov construction use is made of the pθ–representation (pθ being the
variable conjugate to θ), and in the pθ–representation the intensity of the ray–tube is ﬁnite [29].

In the case of unstable states the probability current density is not conserved and a tunnelling

through the centrifugal barrier can, indeed, produce an attenuation of the intensity of the ray

tube. The phenomenon can be represented by picturing trajectories which leave tangentially the
circular orbit and emerge at large distances. In this process the whole R3 space is involved and
we must analyze the Jacobian J of the transformation relating the local coordinates, which are

appropriate for describing the orbiting, to the coordinates of the ambient space, that is the whole
R3 space equipped with the euclidean metric. The leakage from the tube of circular trajectories

can be described as follows. A beam of particles enter the interaction region, describe circular

orbits of radius R, and, after a certain number of revolutions can emerge and leave tangentially the

interaction region. In atomic scattering, the latter is not well–deﬁned because of the long tail of the

potentials. However, we can regard as the domain of interest for the orbiting process, the region

delimited by the centrifugal barrier from one side, and by the hard–core (or more precisely by the

high order singularity of the potential at the origin) from the other side.

It is precisely in this

domain that the orbiting resonances take place; the lifetime of these states is then related to the

probability of tunnelling across the centrifugal barrier. The ambient space is properly described by

the cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), the z–axis being directed along the incident beam and positively

oriented in the direction of the outgoing particles. The local coordinates (θ0, φ0, τ ) are deﬁned as
follows: θ0 is the angle measured along the meridian circle from the point of incidence of the ray;
φ0 is the azimuthal angle, and τ is a parameter along the ray tangential to the circular orbit. We
can then evaluate the Jacobian (see also Ref. [28]):

J =

∂(x, y, z)
∂(θ0, φ0, τ )

= τ (R cos θ0 −

τ sin θ0).

The domain where the Jacobian vanishes is composed by:

α) the surface τ = 0;

β) the semi–axis (z

0, x = 0, y = 0) represented by τ = ¯τ = R cot θ0.

≥

When the Jacobian vanishes the eikonal approximation fails (for a detailed discussion of this very

delicate mathematical point see Ref. [28]); furthermore, on the surface τ = 0 there is an attenuation

of the intensity ﬂux. We shall return below on this point. On the other hand, we can still use the

transport equation written in the following form:

only for the trajectories that have not completed one circular orbit. The factor a(k, θ+

the leakage of the particles by the tunnelling eﬀect. The phase Φ (see formula (4)) now reads:
Φ(θ+

due to the crossing of the trajectory across the z–axis, where the Jacobian J vanishes (see formula
(13)). We can now observe that the angle θ+

Notice that the factor (

that the clockwise trajectory crossed the z–axis twice, even if it has not completed one orbit.

Once again the factor (

sponding to the fact that both the counterclockwise and the clockwise rays cross the z–axis twice

for each complete circular orbit. The term a(k, θs) can be regarded as a damping factor that gives
the attenuation of the tube of circular orbits due to the tunnelling through the centrifugal barrier.

At ﬁxed k we can thus represent the leakage of the tube of orbiting particles by the use of an

exponential of the following form: exp(

is neglected. Nevertheless this approximation is very useful because it can describe a sequence of

resonances and bound states.

In fact, if Re λ is integer and Im λ << 1, then the denominator

sin πλ(E) is close to zero and, accordingly, we observe a bump in the cross–section: i.e., we have an

orbiting resonance. Since λ is a function of the energy, representation (29) describes a sequence of

resonances which are obtained whenever Re λ crosses integer values, while Im λ remains very small.

As we shall see in section 4, Im λ tends to zero as E tends to zero. For negative energy Im λ = 0

and we have bound–states instead of resonances whenever Re λ crosses integer values. At the end,

we obtain a pole trajectory connecting bound–states to resonances as it will be shown in section 4.

3 Orbiting Resonances and Bound–States

In this paper we focus our attention only on those eﬀects that contribute to the more relevant

component of the spectrum: the orbiting resonances and the bound–states. However, they do not

exhaust the entire phenomenology:

in particular, there are also the “direct component” of the

collision which is essentially composed by direct reﬂections, and the forward glory contribution.

The former component does not require particular explanations; instead, it is worth spending a

few words about the forward glory, especially in relation with the so–called “glory undulations”.

The latter eﬀect is produced by those paths that, moving through attractive and repulsive regions

of the potential, undergo equal positive and negative deﬂections and ﬁnally emerge at zero angle.

Then, the interference between such paths and the forward–diﬀracted trajectories with large impact

parameter give rise to forward glory oscillations that appear as undulations (glory undulations) in

the total cross–section [15, 21]. The total number of oscillations can be related to the number of

bound–states in the potential [21]. This relationship is one of the motivations of the great attention

devoted to the “glory–undulations” by several authors [32]. In our analysis we do not consider the

“direct component” of the scattering, which can be globally described by a “background–term”,

which we neglect.

More generally, let us brieﬂy recall that, in classical scattering theory, if the deﬂection function

−

goes through zero (or through a negative multiple of π for a non–zero value of the impact parameter)
the diﬀerential cross–section diverges like (sin Θ)−1 (Θ being the classical deﬂection angle). The

divergence can occur either in the forward direction Θ =

2nπ (n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; forward glory),

or in the backward direction Θ =

(2n + 1)π (n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; backward glory). Returning to the

−

geometrical theory of the orbiting outlined in the previous section, we see that, up to formula (26),
f (k, θs) presents singularities at θs = 0 and θs = π, which are due to the factor (sin θs)−1/2. Next,
cos θs)
passing from formula (26) to representation (27) we introduce the Legendre functions Pλ(
which are logarithmically singular at θs = 0, but regular at θs = π. The smoothing of these
singularities corresponds to the passage from the classical to the semi–classical approximation. As

−

we have already noted several times, the obtained representation is far from being complete, as it

does not represent the direct components of the collision: diﬀraction, direct reﬂection and forward

Hereafter we will show that representation (29), in spite of the limits mentioned above, can,

nevertheless, represent an ordered sequence of orbiting resonances. With this in mind, we project

the amplitude (29) on the l-th partial wave, obtaining:

Formula (32) represents a sequence of orbiting resonances: i.e., an ordered set of phase–shifts that

cross δl = π/2 with positive derivative.

The bound–states are not directly revealed by scattering experiments. We know, however, from

the generalized Levinson theorem that δl(0) = nlπ, where nl is the number of bound–states with
angular momentum l, including those states which are not admitted by the Pauli principle [27].

Hereafter we shall consider, however, atom–atom scattering where the Pauli excluded states are not

involved. Furthermore, in the cases considered in the next section we shall deal with a sequence of

phase–shifts whose zero–energy value is exactly π. This implies that there is a sequence of bound–

states with increasing value of the angular momentum l. We shall see that these bound–states

can be connected with continuity to the sequence of orbiting resonances, obtaining thus a band of

bound–states and resonances (rotational band), generated by a unique pole moving in the complex

angular momentum plane. At this point we are faced with the problem of ﬁnding a representation

which is able to describe either those phase–shifts that do not resonate but decrease from their

zero–energy value, that is π, and cross π/2 downward, and also that part of the phase–shifts that

decrease after a resonance. Since these phase–shifts are due to the repulsive component of the

potential, we can assume, in a very rough model, that they are produced by a hard–core potential.

In the subsequent section we shall see that this model, in spite of its roughness, is in reasonable

agreement with the phenomenological data.

First, let us recall that the phase–shifts produced by an impenetrable sphere of radius r0 are

given by [33]

δl = tan−1 Jl+1/2(kr0)
Nl+1/2(kr0)

,

(33)

where Jl+1/2 and Nl+1/2 denote the Bessel and Neumann functions, respectively. It is easy to check
π/2); but the
that when kr0 = (l + 1)π/2, then the phase–shift δl, given by formula (33), equals (
phenomenological data (see the next section) indicate that the radius r0 of the hard–core, which

−

models the repulsive component of the interaction, varies with l. We can then write krl instead
of kr0, and relate this expression to the angular momentum [α(α + 1)]1/2 through the equality
krl = Bl[α(α + 1)]1/2, where Bl is a phenomenological parameter. We then glue together the term
describing the orbiting to the hard–core phase–shifts as follows:

δl = sin−1

β(2α + 1)
1/2
α)2 + β2][(l + α + 1)2 + β2]
}
where Al, as well as Bl, depends on l, and both can be regarded as ﬁtting parameters. As we
shall show in the next section, formula (34) is able to reproduce an ordered sequence of orbiting

resonances, and also gives in the correct order the downward crossing of the phase–shifts δl through
π/2. The parameter Al in formula (34) accounts for the strength of the repulsive action which
models the singularity of the potential at the origin. This strength decreases as the angular mo-

mentum increases, in agreement with the fact that the radius of the hard–core increases with l.

From the phenomenological analysis the dependence of Al and Bl on l turns out to be nearly linear
(see ﬁgs. 3(c) and (d)).

It is interesting to notice that a similar approach has been applied also in nuclear physics, in
particular in the α–α and α–40Ca elastic scattering (see refs. [34, 35]). In these works the hard–

core–type interaction has been used in place of the more realistic, but less tractable, exchange–forces

which, ultimately, give rise to non–local potentials. However, in this case the approximation is not

very faithful; in fact, while the ﬁts of the rotational resonances are very satisfactory, for what con-

cerns the downward passage of the phase–shifts, the theory yields only the general trend, but lacks

for details. It is currently in progress an analysis of the complex angular momentum singularities

associated with non–local potentials which aims at obtaining a more accurate representation of the

downward behaviour of the nuclear phase–shifts.

4 Phenomenological Analysis

In this section a series of numerical ﬁts, performed by using formula (34), will be presented. The

experimental data being considered concern the H–Kr system, and are taken from Ref.

[5]; in

particular, we refer to ﬁgure 3 of that reference.

In formula (34) the quantities Al and Bl are
considered as free ﬁtting parameters, and for what concerns the functions α(E) and β(E) we adopt

the following parametrizations:

α(α + 1) = 2IE + α0 ,
β = d1α(E)√E + d2√E ,

(35)

(36)

where I = µR2 is the moment of inertia, µ is the reduced mass, R the interparticle distance, and E

is the center of mass energy; the parameters d1 and d2, that from the analysis turn out to be nearly
independent of l, and the intercept α0 are to be determined through the ﬁts of the experimental
phase–shifts (see the ﬁgure legends for numerical details).

E. De Micheli, G.A. Viano – Jan 11/02

12

In ﬁgure 2(a) the ﬁts of the phase–shifts for l = 4, 5, 6, which display orbiting resonances, are

shown. The upward crossings of δl = π/2, i.e. the energies of the resonances, are reported in ﬁgure
2(b) in correspondence of the integer values of α = 4, 5, 6 (ﬁlled dots), along with their interpolation

with the line α(α + 1) as a function of E. The good agreement between resonance locations (E > 0)

and the line α(α + 1) strongly supports the correctness of the linear parametrization (35). Since

α0 > 0, we can extrapolate, for E < 0, the location of the bound–states corresponding to l = 0, 1, 2, 3
(open circles).

In ﬁgures 3(a) and (b) the ﬁts of the phase–shifts for l = 0, 1 and l = 2, 3 are shown. The

high energy behaviour is well reproduced, whereas the Levinson value at E = 0 (i.e., δl = π),
which is clearly satisﬁed by the experimental data, is not reached by the ﬁtting curves. On the

other hand, it is quite tempting to notice that if we extrapolate these theoretical phase–shifts to

the unphysical region at negative energy (in spite of the fact that the phase–shifts have physical

meaning exclusively at non–negative energy), they get close to the value δl = π approximately at
the energies E0, E1, E2 and E3, that closely correspond to the location of the bound–states that
have been recovered from ﬁgure 2(b), and whose angular momenta are precisely l = 0, 1, 2, 3. In

ﬁgures 3(c) and (d) the values of the parameter Al and Bl that result from the ﬁts of ﬁgures 2(a),
3(a) and 3(b) are displayed as functions of l. Al presents a nearly linear decrease with l, while Bl
increases almost linearly with l.

Concluding, we illustrate the relationship between the function β and the widths Γ of the

orbiting resonances. These quantities are related to the tunnelling across the centrifugal barrier,

which is now a complex quantity. We have

5 Final Remarks

In conclusion, we want to stress the diﬀerence between orbiting and diﬀracted rays. The diﬀracted

rays can be explained as follows: when a ray grazes a boundary surface, it splits in two: one part

keeps going as an ordinary ray, whereas the other part travels along the surface. At every point

along its path this ray splits in two again: one part proceeds along the surface, and the other one

leaves the surface along the tangent to the surface itself. This splitting can be mathematically

explained as due to the non–uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for geodesics in a Riemannian

manifold with boundary (see Ref. [28]). The damping factors can then be related to the curvature

E. De Micheli, G.A. Viano – Jan 11/02

13

of the diﬀracting body [28]. Conversely, for what concerns the orbiting case, the attenuation

of the current of orbiting particles is produced by the leakage of the ray tube of the particles

which describe circular orbits, and which is due to the tunnelling across the centrifugal barrier. It

follows that the nature and the extent of the damping factors are drastically diﬀerent in these two

phenomena. We can say that, while the diﬀracted rays are produced by edge eﬀects, this is not

at all the case for the orbiting phenomena. Edge eﬀects are indeed relevant in optics where the

diﬀracting body (i.e., the obstacle) is compact, but in particle scattering they can be observed only

in those processes described by short–range potentials, e.g. decreasing exponentially in r, which

can simulate boundary eﬀects. This does not happen in molecular scattering where the potentials

that describe properly the phenomena are of Lennard–Jones type, which decrease, for large values

of r, only as an inverse power. Thus, we can say that the near–forward diﬀractive scattering by a

potential of this type, that is having a long–range tail, is not due to edge diﬀraction, but is rather

produced by the contributions of very large angular momentum paths that undergo small deﬂection

caused by the tail of the potential (see Ref. [15]).

Finally, it is worth remarking that in the orbiting phenomena and in the case of diﬀracted rays,

the attenuation can be explained merely as a damping of the amplitude, while the phase remains

real: in both cases we can properly speak of real rays. However, one is tempted to explain the atten-

uation of the intensity of the ﬂux by introducing a complex phase, and, accordingly complex rays.

We believe that this approach is not at all convenient for describing orbiting and diﬀraction phe-

nomena, where the attenuation of the amplitude can be evaluated through the transport equation.

Conversely, complex rays emerge, as appropriate mathematical solutions of the eikonal equation,

for representing the shadow of the caustic. Therefore, they play a relevant role in total reﬂection,

where they describe the exponentially damped penetration into the rarer medium associated to

the surface waves traveling along the boundary. In molecular scattering they are again present in

rainbow phenomena, and precisely in the shadow of the rainbow caustic. In fact, we can show that

in the neighborhood of a caustic the nature of the eikonal equation diﬀers from the standard one:

its characteristics, which are real in the illuminated region, become complex conjugate beyond the

caustic (i.e., in the shadow of the caustic), and correspond to the complex rays.

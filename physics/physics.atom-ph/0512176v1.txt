Abstract

When recent experimental positronium (Ps) formation cross sections in noble gases
have been compared with the most up-to date theoretical studies, the agreement is
qualitative, but not quantitative. In this paper we re-examine this process and show
that at low energies Ps formation must be treated nonperturbatively. We also look
at Ps formation with inner shell electrons.

Positronium (Ps) represents a bound state between a positron and an electron.
It is formed in positron-atom collisions,

when the positron energy, ε = k2/2, is above the Ps formation threshold,

Recently positronium formation in Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe has been determined
by two experimental groups [1,2]. The two sets of data are in fairly good
agreement, especially at lower energies. However, recent distorted-wave Born
approximation (DWBA) calculations [3] overestimate the cross sections by a
large factor, ranging from 1.6 in Ne to 3 in Xe, while the overall energy depen-
dence of the DWBA cross sections is in reasonable accord with experiment.
This is in contrast with earlier coupled-static calculations [4], which yield
better magnitudes of the cross section maxima, but disagree on the energy
dependence.

In this paper we perform 1st-order and all-order calculations of Ps formation
from valence and subvalence subshells. Our consideration is restricted to Ps
formation in the ground-state. Noble gas atoms have tightly bound electrons,
making excited-state Ps formation much less probable (see, e.g., [3]). We argue
that a structure observed at energies beyond the main cross section maximum
(described as a shoulder, or in some cases seen as a secondary peak [1,5])
is most likely related to Ps formation by the subvalence ns electrons. We
also consider Ps formation from inner shells. It produces inner-shell vacan-
cies and can be important for positron-annihilation-induced Auger-electron
spectroscopy [6].

2 1st-order approximation

2.1 Ps formation amplitude and cross section

Using 1st-order many-body perturbation theory, and neglecting the interaction
between the outgoing Ps and residual ion, the Ps-formation amplitude can be
written as [7]

where ϕε is the incident positron wavefunction, ψn is the Hartree-Fock wave-
function of the initial electron state (“hole”), and
Ψ1s,K is obtained from the
wavefunction of the ground-state Ps with momentum K,

state,

The positron wavefunction is calculated in the ﬁeld of the ground state atom
described in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The Ps center-of-mass motion
is described by a plane wave. The Ps formation cross section is found by
integration over the directions of K,

σPs =

where M = 2 and K = [2M(ε − |εn| + |E1s|)]1/2 are the Ps mass and momen-
tum, and φε(r) ∼ eik·r normalization is assumed. The approximation (3)–(6)
is equivalent to DWBA for a rearrangement collision.

A numerical calculation of the amplitude and cross section was performed by
expanding the Ps wavefunction in electron and positron spherical harmonics
with respect to the nucleus. Integration over the angular variables was done
analytically, while the radial integrals are calculated numerically (see [7] for
some details). To ensure accurate positions of the Ps formation thresholds, ex-
perimental ionization energies |εn|, rather than the Hartree-Fock values, were
used in the calculations. Detailed below are the Ps-formation cross sections for
neon, argon, krypton and xenon, calculated using the 1st-order approximation
described above.

2.2 Partial-wave contributions

The cross sections are found by summing over the positron partial waves from
l = 0 to 10. Figure 1 shows the partial wave contributions for the 3p subshell
of argon. Note that the p, d, f and g waves have the largest individual cross
sections and make up most of the cross section peak. The contributions of
higher partial waves are suppressed by the centrifugal barrier, preventing the
close encounters which lead to Ps formation. The small contribution of the
s-wave is due to it being spherically symmetric, making it harder for the
positron to bind and move away with an electron. This is true for all the
noble gases. The exceptionally small s-wave contribution to Ps formation was
noticed earlier for hydrogen and helium (see, e.g., [8,9,10]) and explained by
the hidden-crossing method [11].

subshell of argon. Various thin curves are the contributions of l = 0–10, while the
solid thick curve is the total cross section.

2.3 Comparison with experiment

Figure 2 shows the Ps-formation cross sections for the valence np and subva-
lence ns orbitals together with their sum, for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe. The present
results for the np subshell practically coincide with the Ps(1s) formation cross
section from DWBA [3]. The calculations are compared with the experimental
data obtained with a cold, trap-based positron beam [2], and with the cross
section found by subtracting the direct ionization cross section from the total
ionization cross section [1]. Moving from Ne to Xe, the calculations increas-
ingly overestimate the measured cross section near the maximum.

For Ne, Ar and Xe experiment and theory converge at higher energies, while
in Kr the discrepancy persists. Such convergence should be expected from a
theory point of view. Indeed, at higher positron energies the dominant contri-
bution to the amplitude (3) and cross section (6) comes from higher partial
waves, for which the plane-wave description of the Ps motion is more accu-
rate. At the same time, the contributions of individual partial waves to the
amplitude become small. This means that higher-order corrections neglected
by the 1st-order theory may not be important (see below). Thus, we cannot
oﬀer an explanation for the divergence between theory and experiment in Kr.

2.4 Inner-shell Ps formation

Ps-formation thresholds for the inner shells lie at much higher energies, e.g.,
at 242 and 320 eV for the 2p and 2s orbitals in Ar. As a result, the incident
positron wavefunction oscillates rapidly, reducing the magnitude of the am-

plitude (3). Ps formation from inner shells is additionally suppressed by the
positron repulsion from the nucleus. The Ps-formation cross sections for Ne,
Ar, Kr and Xe are shown in Figure 3. It can be noted that signiﬁcantly higher
energies are required to produce positronium for the lighter noble gases (with
the more tightly bound electrons).

In general, the Ps-formation cross sections for the inner-shell electrons are
quite small. Thus, in neon, the valence shell contribution still dominates, even
at positron energies of 1600 eV. In argon, it can be seen that up to 500 eV, the
valence contribution dominates the cross section. However, above this energy
all subshells contribute approximately equally to the total cross section, and as
the energy increases further, the 2p subshell contributes the most. In krypton,
the 3d subshell contributes most to the Ps-formation cross section, as this
subshell is relatively far away from the nucleus. This is also true for xenon,
where the 4d subshell dominates the cross section. Note also that in Kr and
especially Xe the inner-shell cross sections are much larger than those of Ne
and even Ar, with their Ps formation threshold values nearly ten times smaller
than that of 1s in Ne.

3 Ps formation: nonperturbative approach

3.1 Check of unitarity

As seen from Figure 2, the Ps formation cross sections increase dramatically
from Ne to Xe. This increase is matched by a growing discrepancy between
the 1st-order results and experiment. This suggests that as the cross sec-
tions become larger, the lowest-order perturbation theory treatment becomes
increasingly inaccurate. Indeed, it turns out that in the 1st-order approxima-
tion, equations (3)–(6), the lower partial-wave contributions (l = 0–3) which
dominate near the cross section maximum, become close to and even violate
(for Kr and Xe) the unitarity limit for inelastic processes, σ(l)
Ps ≤ π(2l + 1)/k2.
A comparison with the unitarity limit is presented in Figure 4 for the s and p
partial waves in Ar, Kr and Xe.

Physically, unitarity ensures that the amount of Ps formed in positron-atom
collisions cannot be greater than the number of positrons going in. Any in-
elastic cross section above this limit is physically impossible. The fact that
our 1st-order results (and the analogous DWBA cross sections of Ref. [3]) are
close to, or exceed the unitarity limit means that Ps formation is a strong
process which cannot be treated perturbatively. Hence, in addition to the 1st-

which account for the decay of A+Ps back into the e+ + A channel, followed by
Ps formation, etc. In other words, the eﬀect of Ps formation on the incident
positron must be taken into account. We do this by means of an all-order
approach outlined in the next section.

3.2 All-order approximation

The eﬀect of Ps formation on the positron can be described by the Ps-
formation contribution to the positron-atom correlation potential, deﬁned by
its matrix elements [7],

redirected into the Ps formation channel. In fact, the 1st-order Ps formation

the positron states adopted in Secs. 2 and 3.2, caution is required when using
equations (6) and (8) to relate σPs to Imhε|Σ(Ps)
|εi (such relation is derived
below).

A nonperturbative (“all-order”) calculation of Ps formation is done by solving
an integral equation for the matrix elements of ˜ΣE (see, e.g., [12]),

tan ∆δl = −πhε| ˜Σε|εi,

where ∆δl is the additional phaseshift due to the correlation potential. For
energies E above the Ps formation threshold, the correlation potential, Σ(Ps)
E ,
is complex, and the phaseshift has a nonzero imaginary part, δ′′
l > 0. The Ps-
formation cross section is then obtained from δ′′
l by summing over the partial
waves,

3.3 Total Ps-formation cross sections

Figure 5 shows the all-order and 1st-order cross sections for Ne, Ar, Kr and
Xe along with the two sets of experimental data. As expected, the diﬀer-
ence between the all-order and 1st-order results is greater for atoms where
the Ps formation cross section is large, i.e., for Kr and Xe. The all-order ap-
proximation has reduced the cross section maxima for all atoms, but still not
signiﬁcantly enough to match the experiment. However, theory and experi-
ment are in better agreement at higher positron energies. The situation looks
especially encouraging in Xe, where both experiments and theory are close
above 40 eV. Note that for Kr and Xe, the all-order and 1st-order cross sec-
tions are markedly diﬀerent even at the higher-energy part of the scale. This
emphasizes the need for nonperturbative treatment of Ps formation.

and Ar, where we expected its eﬀect to be insigniﬁcant. In fact, the 2s-subshell
contribution to the Ps-formation cross section in Ne is very small. Experimen-
tal data in Ne also do not reveal any clear features that could be related to
the opening of a new channel at ε ≈ 42 eV. The Ps formation from the 3s
subshell in Ar is relatively more important. The opening of this channel at
about 22.5 eV coincides with the onset of the second peak in the UCL data
[1]. It also marks the start of a weak shoulder-like structure in the UCSD data
[2], where earlier experiments [5] showed a much more prominent feature. The
reason for the discrepancy between diﬀerent experimental observations is at
present unclear, but we suggest that the origin of this structure is most likely
related to the opening of the 3s Ps-formation channel.

Using the all-order approach makes a much greater diﬀerence in krypton and
xenon. The valence np contribution is greatly reduced in the energy range
around the maximum. In contrast, the subvalence ns contribution is increased
in the all-order approach. The onset of the Ps-formation cross section from
the 4s orbital in Kr is very smooth. The UCSD data for Kr do not show any
feature just above 20 eV, while the UCL data possess a clear shoulder, whose
onset is more rapid than that predicted by the theory. At higher energies
the two sets of experimental data diverge, with our all-order results being in-
between. Given that the theory is expected to be more reliable here than at
lower energies, we suggest that this discrepancy points to a need for further
experimental studies.

Of the four atoms examined, Xe has the largest Ps formation cross section
by the subvalence electrons. Its contribution results in a change of slope of
the calculated total cross section. For Xe both sets of experimental data show
a clear shoulder-like structure, whose onset is close to the 5s Ps-formation
threshold. The overall size of the shoulder is comparable with the calculated
5s Ps formation cross section (chain curve in Figure 5). At higher energies
there is good agreement between the two experiments and the calculated cross
section.

One may speculate that in a better calculation, the Ps-formation cross section
from the valence np orbital will be suppressed around its maximum and at
the energies below 40 eV. Then, even if the ns Ps-formation cross sections
remain close to the present estimates, their contribution to the total will be
more noticeable.

Finally, an alternative explanation of the shoulder/secondary-peak structure
discussed, e.g., in Ref. [1], is that it is caused by Ps formation in excited states.
According to the DWBA calculations of Gilmore et al. [3], this contribution
is not negligible (though small). However, the thresholds for excited-state Ps
formation lie much lower than the energies where the structures are observed,

thresholds, rather than the Ps-formation thresholds.

4 Conclusions

A comparison of the 1st-order and all-order results shows that as Ps forma-
tion is strong, it cannot be treated perturbatively. Going beyond the 1st-order
approximation reduces the cross sections, especially at low energies. However,
below 40 eV the calculated cross sections are still higher than experimen-
tal values. Above this energy theory and experiment generally converge. In
particular, in Xe we observe good agreement between the calculations and
experimental data from the UCL and UCSD groups.

There are two reasons for the discrepancy between theory and experiment
at low energies. First, the motion of Ps in our calculations is described by
a plane wave. The electron part of the Ps wavefunction is orthogonalized
to the target electron orbitals. This manifestation of the Pauli principle to
some extent accounts for the interaction between the Ps and the ﬁnal-state
ion. On the other hand, the positron repulsion from the nucleus in the ﬁnal
Ps state is completely neglected. This repulsion is especially important for
the lower positron partial waves. Its neglect is probably the main reason for
the overestimation of the Ps-formation cross section maxima by the present
method.

Secondly, all open channels, i.e., elastic scattering, Ps formation and direct ion-
ization must be included simultaneously. Above the atomic ionization thresh-
old all of these channels compete for the positron ﬂux. This eﬀect can be
accounted for by the correlation potential method described in Sec. 3.2, by
adding the lowest 2nd-order contribution to ΣE (see, e.g., [13]). However, to
be able to extract the Ps formation cross section from such a calculation, the
formalism of Sec. 3.2 must be extended. In the present form the imaginary
part of the phaseshift allows one to ﬁnd only the total reaction cross section.

One may expect that both of these eﬀects will make the Ps formation cross
section smaller, and bring it into a close agreement with experiment. By further
including Ps formation from the inner valence subshell and Ps formation in
excited states, one should achieve a complete description of the Ps formation
process, including any secondary structures.

We present observations of VUV transitions between doubly excited sextet states in O IV, F V
and Ne VI. Spectra were produced by collisions of an O+ beam with a solid carbon target. We
also studied spectra obtained previously of F V and Ne VI. Some observed lines were assigned to
the 1s2s2p23d 6L - 1s2p33d 6D, L=F, D, P electric-dipole transitions, and compared with results of
MCHF (with QED and higher-order corrections) and MCDF calculations. 42 new lines have been
identiﬁed. Highly excited sextet states in ﬁve-electron ions provide a new form of energy storage
and are possible candidates for VUV and x-ray lasers.

INTRODUCTION

Highly excited sextet states in ﬁve-electron ions pro-
vide a form of energy storage. The research for stimu-
lated VUV- and x-ray emission from highly excited sextet
states in ﬁve-electron ions has attracted attention in re-
cent years. This new form of energy storage and potential
VUV-ray lasers could have many applications in basic sci-
ence, technology, medicine, and defense. In a proposed
VUV and x-ray laser system, one seeks a probability to
trigger a release of K- and L-hole energies of sextet states
in boron-like ions. Although K- and L-hole energies are
not as high as energies released in nuclear fusion, capac-
ity of highly excited sextet states in ﬁve-electron ions to
store energy is signiﬁcant (several hundred electron volts
per atom shown in Fig. 1). Such a system involves long-
lived ”storage” metastable states, and there nearby are
short-lived higher excited sextet states, from which tran-
sitions are emitted with photon radiation, and quintet
continuum. An ideal system where VUV and x-ray lasers
may be implemented would be among heavy and highly
excited ions that have metastbale sextet states with long
lifetimes. However, structure and transition properties
of these sextet states are currently very poorly known.

In 1992 beam-foil spectroscopy [1, 2] was used to pro-
vide initial data on low-lying sextet states in doubly ex-
cited boron-like nitrogen, oxygen and ﬂuorine. Recent
work of Lapierre and Knystautas [2] on possible sextet
transitions in Ne VI highlights the signiﬁcance in this se-
quence. They measured several excitation energies and
lifetimes. Fine structures of individual 1s2s2p23s 6PJ
states were resolved and measured in O IV, F V and Ne
VI by Lin and Berry et al [3]. There are no further re-

states.

In his work, fast beam-foil spectra of oxygen were
recorded at Liege using grading incidence spectrome-
ters [4, 5]. Spectra of ﬂuorine and neon were previously
recorded at the University of Lyon and the Argonne Na-
tional Lab, The 1s2s2p23d 6L - 1s2p33d 6D, L=F, D, P
electric-dipole transitions in O IV, F V and Ne VI have
been searched in these spectra, and compared with re-
sults of MCHF (with QED and higher-order corrections)
and MCDF calculations.

Energies, lifetimes and relevant E1 transition rates of
the doubly excited sextet states 1s2s2p23d 6L, L=F, D,
P and 1s2p33d 6D in boron-like O IV, F V and Ne VI

were calculated with Multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock
(MCHF) method [6, 7] (with QED and higher-order rela-
tivistic corrections [3, 8]), and Multi-conﬁguration Dirac-
Fock (MCDF) GRASP code [9, 10, 11].

where ci is a conﬁguration interaction coeﬃcient, N is
a total number of conﬁgurations with the same LSJMJ
and parity, and φ(ßi,LS=5/2JMJ) is a conﬁguration state
function (CSF).

In single-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (SCHF) calcula-
tions only the conﬁgurations corresponding to the desired
levels, 1s2s2p23d or 1s2p33d, were considered. After up-
dating MCHF codes we performed relativistic calcula-
tions with an initial expansion of up to 4000 CSFs and a
full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian matrix. For a ﬁve-electron
system a CI expansion generated by an active set leads
to a large number of expansions. To reduce the num-
ber of conﬁgurations, we chose conﬁgurations n1l1n2l2
n3l3 n4l4 n5l5, where ni=1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, li=0, ...min
(4, ni-1). We did not include g electrons for n=5 shell.
For MCHF calculations of the lower states 1s2s2p23d 6L,
L=F, D, P we chose 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d and
5s electrons to compose conﬁgurations. For the 1s2p33d
6D state we chose 1s through 4d electrons. Fine struc-
ture splitting is strongly involved in the experiments and
identiﬁcations. After determining radial wavefunctions
we included relativistic operators of mass correction, one-
and two-body Darwin terms and spin-spin contact term
in both SCHF and MCHF calculations; these were not
included by Miecznik et al [6].

We used the screened hydrogenic formula from [3,
12, 13, 14] to estimate quantum electrodynamic eﬀects
(QED) and higher-order relativistic contributions for sex-
tet states in ﬁve-electron oxygen, ﬂuorine and neon.

In MCDF [9, 10, 11] calculations, ﬁrstly we used
single-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock approach (SCDF). A
basis of
jj-coupled states to all possible total angu-
lar momenta J from two non-relativistic conﬁgurations,
1s2s2p23d and 1s2p33d, was considered. For conver-
gence we included the ground state 1s22s22p of the ﬁve-
electron systems. After calculating all possible levels
for all J, eigenvectors were regrouped in a basis of LS
terms. To obtain better evaluations of correlation ener-
gies of the doubly excited sextet terms 1s2s2p23d 6L,
L=F, D, P and 1s2p33d 6D in O IV, F V and Ne
VI, improved calculations included 1s22s22p, 1s22s2p2,
1s2s22p2, 1s2s2p3, 1s2s2p23s, 1s2s2p23p, 1s2s2p23d,
1s2p33s, 1s2p33p, 1s2p33d, 1s2p34s, 1s2p34p and 1s2p34d
mixing non-relativistic conﬁgurations.

In GRASP code [9, 10, 11] QED eﬀects, self-energy and
vacuum polarization correction, were taken into account

2

by using eﬀective nuclear charge Zef f in the formulas
of QED eﬀects, which comes from an analogous hydro-
genic orbital with the same expectation value of r as the
MCDF-orbital in question [9, 10, 11].

III. EXPERIMENT

The experiments were performed with a standard fast-
ion beam-foil excitation system at a Van de Graaﬀ ac-
celerator beam line at the University of Liege [5, 15, 16,
17, 18]. To produce spectra of oxygen in the wavelength
region near 660-710 ˚A a beam current of about 1.3 µA of
32O+
2 and 16O+ ions accelerated to energies of 1.5 and 1.7
MeV were yielded at the experimental setup. Such ener-
gies were expected to be an optimum for the comparison
and production of O3+ ions by ion-foil interaction [19].
The beam current goes through a carbon exciter foil.
The foils were made from a glow discharge, had surface
densities about 10-20 µg/cm2 and lasted for 1-2 hours
under the above radiation.

VUV radiation emitted by excited oxygen ions was dis-
persed by a 1m- Seya-Namioka grating-incidence spec-
trometer at about 90 degrees to the ion beam direc-
tion. A low-noise channeltron (below 1 count/min) was
served as a detector. Spectra were recorded at energies
of 1.5 and 1.7 MeV with 100/100 µm slits (the line width
(FWHM) was 1.1 ˚A) and 40/40 µm slits (the line width
(FWHM) was 0.7 ˚A) in the wavelength range of 660-710
˚A.

We have reinvestigated unpublished beam-foil spectra
of 16O3+, 19F4+ and 20Ne5+ ions recorded previously by
accelerating 16O+, 20(FH)+ and 20Ne+ ions to beam en-
ergies of 2.5 MeV, 2.5 MeV and 4.0 MeV at the Univer-
sity of Lyon and the Argonne National Lab. The line
width (FWHM) was 0.3 ˚A, 0.8 ˚A and 0.3 ˚A in the wave-
length range of 660-710 ˚A, 567-612 ˚A and 490-555 ˚A in
the spectra, respectively.

IV. RESULTS

Fig. 2(a) -2(c) display three typical spectra of oxy-
gen at beam energies of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 MeV in the
wavelength range of 660-710 ˚A. In the wavelength re-
gion of 660-710 ˚A transitions between the sextet states
1s2s2p23d 6L - 1s2p33d 6D, L=F, D, P in O IV were ex-

pected. At an O2
are mainly excited to terms of O2+ and O3+. There are
no lines emitted from sextet states in O IV in Fig. 2(a).
At an O+ beam energy of 1.7 MeV, O+ ions are mainly
excited to terms of O3+ and O4+. New and unidentiﬁed
emissions appear in the spectrum in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 2(c)
shows a spectrum with better resolution to see details of
lines.

2s2p3 transitions are at 659.589 ˚A, 670.601 ˚A, 681.332
˚A and 703.854 ˚A, respectively, close to the neighborhood
of the doubly excited sextet transitions. The four wave-
lengths have been semiempirically ﬁtted with high accu-
racy ±0.004 ˚A by [21, 22, 23] and provide a good cali-
bration for the measurements. Standard error for wave-
length calibration is ±0.01 ˚A in the wavelength region of
660-710 ˚A. Nonlinear least square ﬁts of Gaussian proﬁles
gave values for wavelengths, intensities and full widths at
half maximum (FWHM) of lines. Uncertainties of wave-
lengths are related to intensities of lines. Through the use
of optical refocusing we achieved spectroscopic line width
of 0.3 ˚A. Precision of the proﬁle-ﬁtting program was
checked through several known transition wavelengths.

Most of new identiﬁcations have been obtained by
searching in the spectra for sets of unidentiﬁed lines
and by comparing energies and relative intensities
of the 1s2s2p23d 6L-1s2p33d 6Do, L=F, D and P
transitions with results of calculations by MCHF and

6Fo-1s2p33d 6D transition in O IV recorded at an O+
ion energy of 2.5 MeV. The curve SCHF’ is convoluted
theoretical proﬁle of ﬁne structure components with a
Gaussian function. The experimental width of 0.3 ˚A for
the oxygen spectrum was utilized. The transition rates
to ﬁne structure j=11/2 to 1/2 of the lower state were
results of single-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (SCHF) cal-
culations by this work. The wavelengths of ﬁne structure
components were calculated SCHF results plus a ﬁtted
shift for all ﬁve components. Measured wavelength of
a component is the weighted center of the ﬁtted proﬁle
of experimental data. Experimental transition rate is
proportional to area of a peak (ﬁtted intensity×FWHM
of experimental data). The curve ”Sum” is summation
of ﬁtted ﬁne structure components of experimental data.

theoretical ratio of E1 GF values (in length gauge) of
SCHF calculations of 1.188:0.990:0.793:0.595:0.397:0.198
= 6.00:5.00:4.00:3.00:2.00:1.00. Based on above analysis
we assign the set of lines as the 1s2s2p23d 6F-1s2p33d

6Do transition in O IV, and determine their wavelengths
with good accuracy of ±0.06 ˚A.

Similarly, after studying details of transitions theoret-
ically and experimentally described above, and compar-
ing with multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) and
multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations of
O IV by this work, we were able to assign these uniden-
tiﬁed observed lines as the 1s2s2p23d 6L-1s2p33d 6Do,
L=F, D and P electric-dipole transitions in O IV. Results
of the identiﬁcation and measurements of wavelengths of
the transitions are listed in Table I. Errors of measured
wavelengths of ±0.06 ˚A are small mainly from calibration
and curve ﬁtting. The latter includes experimental and
statistical errors. In Table I average theoretical transi-
tion energy AV is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23d
6L-1s2p33d 6Do transition energies (computed from ﬁne
structure lines calculated by this work) with results of
theoretical analysis. Experimental transition energy AV
is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23d 6L-1s2p33d 6Do
transition energies (computed from observed lines) with
results of experimental transition rate analysis. AVT
is summation of above average transition energy (AV),
QED eﬀect (QED) and higher-order correction (HO). Er-
rors for calculated transition energies in Table I are the
root mean squared diﬀerences of calculated and exper-
imental transition energies as given below in the table.
We also list calculated non-relativistic transition ener-
gies (N-REL) by SCHF method. In Table I we present
measured ﬁne structure wavelength values and theoreti-
cal values for O IV. The measured and calculated results
are consistent after considering experimental and theo-
retical errors. Fourteen lines are new observations with
wavelength accuracy of ±0.06 ˚A.

It is noted that in Fig. 2 the line for the 1s2s2p23d
6F7/2-1s2p33d 6Do
J ′=∗ transition in O IV is much stronger
than the SCHF result. The line is a blend of the
1s2s2p23d 6FJ=7/2-1s2p33d 6Do
J ′=∗ transition in O IV
and a line at the wavelength of 666.27±0.06 ˚A. The lat-
ter was identiﬁed as the 1s22p3p 1D2-1s22p4d 1F3 tran-
sition at the wavelength of 666.819±0.03 ˚A [21, 22, 23].
In this work we could resolve the set of lines and im-
prove the wavelength accuracy of the 1s22p3p 1D2-
1s22p4d 1F3 transition to 666.27±0.06 ˚A. We list re-
sults in Table II. For the 1s22p3p 1D2 state there
are two couplings, 1s22p(j=1/2)3p(j’=3/2) 1D2 and
1s22p(j=3/2)3p(j’=1/2) 1D2. For the 1s22p4d 1F3 state
there are two couplings, 1s22p(j=1/2)4d(j’=5/2) 1F3 and
1s22p(j=3/2)4d(j’=3/2) 1F3. Their energies are diﬀer-
ent. MCHF and MCDF methods handle it in diﬀerent
ways and give diﬀerent results. MCHF calculation gives
the minimum energies among both conﬁgurations.
In
Table II are listed wavelengths of SCHF and SCDF cal-
culations. We studied the spectrum in the wavelength
range around 590 ˚A and found a strong unidentiﬁed line
located at 599.85±0.06 ˚A. After studying its details, we
assign it as the 1s22p3p 1D2-1s22p4d 1F3 transition in O

We obtained spectra at a 20(HF)+ beam energy of 2.5

we achieved spectroscopic line width of 0.7 ˚A. Using simi-
lar experimental analysis as described above we obtained
the wavelength accuracy of ±0.10 ˚A for the 1s2s2p23d

570-620 ˚A [24, 25].
In Table III all observed lines for

1s2s2p23d 6F11/2-1s2p33d 6Do

length of 574.05±0.10 ˚A.

We obtained spectra at a 20Ne+ ion beam energy of
4.0 MeV for neon. Through the use of optical refocusing
we achieved spectroscopic line width of 0.4 ˚A in the sec-
ond order spectrum. Similarly, we obtained wavelength
accuracy of ±0.05 ˚A for the 1s2s2p23d 6L - 1s2p33d 6Do
transitions in the wavelength region of 490-550 ˚A [26, 27].
In Table IV we present measured ﬁne structure wave-

In Fig. 4 MCDF, SCHF and SCDF
diﬀerences are constant for the 1s2s2p23d 6F - 1s2p33d
6Do transitions with nuclear charge Z = 8, 9 and 10.
Non-relativistic diﬀerences (N-REL) are linear. MCHF
diﬀerences for oxygen and ﬂuorine are small, just 106 and
249 cm−1.

In Fig. 5 SCHF, SCDF and MCDF diﬀerences are
constant for the 1s2s2p23d 6D - 1s2p33d 6Do transitions
with nuclear charge Z = 8, 9 and 10. Non-relativistic
diﬀerences are linear. MCHF diﬀerences for oxygen and
ﬂuorine are small, just 235 and 104 cm−1.

In Fig. 6 SCHF and MCDF diﬀerences are constant
for the 1s2s2p23d 6P - 1s2p33d 6Do transitions with nu-
clear charge Z = 8, 9 and 10. SCDF and non-relativistic
diﬀerences are linear. These linear or constant energy
diﬀerences can be used to predict easily and with high ac-

In Fig. 7, 8 and 9 are summarized details of experi-
mental ﬁne structures of the 1s2s2p23d 6LJ , L=F, D, P
states in O IV, F V and Ne VI. Comparisons of measured
ﬁne structures of the 1s2s2p23d 6LJ states show reason-
able tendency. Here error bars are from experiments.

MCHF, SCHF and MCDF calculated lifetimes for the
1s2s2p23d 6P and 1s2p33d 6Do states in N III, O IV, F
V Ne VI and Na VII by this work are listed in Table V,
and compared with results of measurements of Blanke et
al
[1] and calculations of Miecznik et al [6]. They are
plotted in Fig. 10 and 11. Discrepancy between theory
and experiments is around or larger than experimental
errors (see Fig. 10), most probably due to additional
decay modes of M2 and radiative autoionization or some
missing conﬁgurations which are important for MCHF
and MCDF calculations.

QED and higher-order corrections for the 1s2s2p23d
6L - 1s2p33d 6Do, L=F, D, P transitions in O IV, F V
and Ne VI are up to -220-370 cm-1 (see Table I, III and
IV) and can’t be ignored in careful comparison with ex-
periments. Here QED and higher-order corrections were
calculated from eﬀective nuclear charge Zef f obtained

plots of the above corrections to weighted mean tran-
sition energies. The results show that weighted mean
wavelengths for the 1s2s2p23d 6L - 1s2p33d 6Do, L=F,
D, P transitions in O IV, F V and Ne VI are sensitive to
QED and higher-order corrections to 0.27 ˚A, 0.26 ˚A and
0.18 ˚A, respectively. They are larger than estimated ex-
perimental precision of ±0.06 ˚A, ±0.10 ˚A and ±0.05 ˚A.
Transition energies are strongly related to electron corre-
lation. We could not get exact electron correlation. QED
and higher-order corrections of sextet states in boron-like
systems are large enough to be seen experimentally. This

work could provide a good test for QED and higher-order
corrections if electron correlation were known.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We performed MCHF (with QED and higher-order
corrections) and MCDF calculations to get energies, life-
times and relevant E1 transition wavelengths and rates
for the 1s2s2p23d 6L - 1s2p33d 6Do , L=F, D, P electric-
dipole transitions in ﬁve-electron O IV, F V and Ne VI.
Present beam-foil study of oxygen, ﬂuorine and neon led
to observations of 42 new lines in the sextet system of
O IV, F V and Ne VI. We measured wavelengths with
Identiﬁcations are mainly obtained by
good accuracy.
comparing transition wavelengths and rates with results
of MCHF and MCDF calculations. Theoretical and ex-
perimental transition energies are consistent in errors.

Diﬀerences between theoretical and experimental transi-
tion energies are in reasonable range. For lifetimes of the
1s2s2p23d 6P states in O IV and F V there remain large
discrepancies of about 20% between results of MCHF and
MCDF calculations and experiments from [1].

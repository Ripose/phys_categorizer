We have derived a closed form analytic expression for the asymptotic motion of a pair of identical
ions in a high precision Penning trap. The analytic solution includes the eﬀects of special relativity
and the Coulomb interaction between the ions. The existence and physical relevance of such a ﬁnal
state is supported by a conﬂuence of theoretical, experimental and numerical evidence.

PACS numbers: 32.80.Pj, 02.20+b, 33.80.Ps

High precision Penning traps are ideal for studying phys-
ical characteristics of individual ions. These traps, as
described for example in Ref.[1], have magnetic ﬁelds
that over the trajectories of the ions vary by less than a
part per billion. In consequence, the motional frequency
linewidths can be made so narrow that eﬀects of special
relativity are readily apparent even at these relatively low
velocities2.

To remove systematic eﬀects it is often desirable to ﬁll
the trap with two ions and much is known about the re-
sulting frequency perturbations caused by the Coulomb
interaction between dissimilar ions3. The situation with
two identical ions has also been extensively studied much
(see Ref.[4,5] and references therein). The solution and
approach that we describe here are rather diﬀerent than
those references however, since they include the electric
trap ﬁeld but ignore relativistic mass increase. Includ-
ing this eﬀect of special relativity may be crucial for un-
derstanding the observation6 of cyclotron mode-locking
between identical ions (see also Ref.[7]).

We present details of an analytical model of two iden-
tical ions in a high precision Penning trap. The model
is asymptotically solvable in terms of elliptic functions.
This solution is, in practical terms for protons and heav-
ier ions, a generic ﬁnal state of two identical ions in a
precision Penning trap.

We begin with a symmetry argument detailing what
is special about the two identical ion system and then
we introduce and solve the model. For two dissimilar
ions the center of charge is diﬀerent than the center of
mass. The motion of the center of charge causes currents
to run in the detection circuit and in the walls of the
trap itself causing a force to act back on the ions. This
retarding force acts on the center of charge and so if the
center of charge is diﬀerent than the center of mass these

damping forces act always on a mixture of the center of
mass motion and the relative motions of the ion pair.

This is not the case for identical ions in the trap. In
that case the center of mass and the center of charge
are the same and so the retarding force acts only on the
center of mass motion. Thus, the relative motion of the
ions is relatively undamped, being subject only to the
weaker quadrupolar damping (which is associated with
timescales generally longer than typical experiments). In
this sense we speak of this ﬁnal state of the two identical
ion system as a decoupled, or, dark state.

One way to understand the existence of this cyclotron
dark state is with a symmetry argument. Neglect dissi-
pation, relativity and interaction and consider the Pois-
son algebra of two ions moving in a horizontal plane (we
shall describe why this is relevant to experiment later)
in a uniform perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. The Hamilto-
= p2
nian is proportional to
4), where
α = ma/mb is the mass ratio and p1,2 (resp. p3,4) are the
canonical momenta of particle a (resp. particle b). For
α
is so(2) x so(2)
whereas if α = 1 the algebra is so(2) x so(3). The fact
that there are additional commuting generators in the
equal mass case indicates that there is a ﬂat direction in
the dynamics of that case, corresponding to degeneracy
between cyclotron dark states of diﬀerent total angular
momentum.

There is a straightforward geometrical way of under-
standing the special qualities of the two identical ion
Penning trap. Again consider the ions conﬁned to a
plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and ignore tem-
porarily the eﬀects of relativity and interaction. The to-
tal angular momentum of the two ion system is L =

batively, we learn that the motion is essentially restricted
and iso- L surfaces. A generic
to the intersection of iso-
intersection of these surfaces in R4 for the α
= 1 case is
a two-dimensional torus (and so has an isometry group
so(2) x so(2)) whereas when α = 1 the intersection is
not generic, but is the whole S3. Although the isome-
try group of S3, being so(4), is isomorphic to so(3) x
so(3) the physically relevant isometry group is that which
preserves not only the geometry but also the underly-
ing Poisson structure, which is sp(4) in this case. The
canonical intersection8 in the group of matrices GL(4) of
so(4) and sp(4) is the algebra u(2), which is isomorphic
to so(2) x so(3), which again is the enhanced symmetry
discussed above. We note that both the geometrical and
algebraic picture can be easily generalized to the case of
N identical ions9.

Having described the symmetry properties unique to
two identical ions in a Penning trap, we now introduce
the interacting model by starting with the following three
assumptions.

1) The ions are very near the center of the trap, and
ignore eﬀects due to the spatial gradient of the electro-
static ﬁelds of the trap (that is, we completely ignore the
trap magnetron motion). The cyclotron frequency shifts
in an isolated ion’s cyclotron motion is entirely due to
relativistic eﬀects.

2) the ions are mode locked already in the trap’s axial
drive and so their motions may be thought of as being
conﬁned to a plane6,7.

3) The energy loss mechanism is entirely due to the
dissipation of
image charge currents induced in the
trap/detection system, and thus couple only to the center
of mass of the ion pair).

Under these assumptions, the equations of motion for
the ion pair are the formidable looking non-linear coupled
diﬀerential equations;

is just the ratio of the kinetic energy to the

rest mass-energy of ion 1 (similar expression for f2 is in
terms of the kinetic energy of the second particle). This
term, due entirely to special relativistic mass increase,
causes the cyclotron frequency to depend on the kinetic
energy of the ion(s).

We add and subtract Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) to rewrite
them in terms of the center of mass co-ordinate ~Xcm and
the relative coordinate ~R,

As per earlier discussion, from Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), it
is clear that the center of mass motion is damped but
the relative motion is not. Thus, after suﬃcient time, it
is consistent to assume that the center of mass motion
damps out completely, that is, ~V
0. The coupling

motion is through the term proportional to f1 −

The resulting motion can be treated perturbatively in

pling term completely, resulting in exponential decay for
~V and the total center-of-mass kinetic energy. Asymp-
totically for the relative co-ordinate Eq. (4) becomes

This is a system of two coupled non-linear second or-
der diﬀerential equations. Generally such systems do not
admit closed-form, analytical solution. Somewhat sur-
prisingly, we now point out that Eq. (5) admits a general
solution in terms of elliptic functions.

The approach is standard. First we ﬁnd two integrals
of the motion, reducing the four (phase space) dimen-
sional system in Eq. (5) to a two dimensional (phase
space) system. The integrals are the energy and a gen-
eralization of angular momentum. The inter-ion energy

results from taking the dot product of Eq. (5) with
forming the total diﬀerential, and integrating to ﬁnd the

Since the equations have manifest rotational symmetry,
there is a conserved angular momentum. As always with
a magnetic ﬁeld, the total angular momentum receives a
contribution from the magnetic ﬁeld. Proceed by taking

L0 represents the generalized angular momentum.

Since they are independent, the constants of motion
in equations Eq. (6) and Eq. (8) constrain the motion
to lie in a two-dimensional surface in the original four-
dimensional phase space. Of course, that fact by itself is
insuﬃcient to guarantee integrability of the equations of
motion in closed form. However additional peculiarities
of this system Eq. (5) result in closed form solution.

The integral is a combination of standard elliptic func-
tions. In lab co-ordinates R, φ the orbits will in general
be open (with some precession rate which can be written
in terms of complete elliptic integrals) just as viewing the
orbits in the R, t co-ordinates, where now “precession” in
t in simply the period of the orbit. The period T of these
orbits is thus given by a contour integral of the RHS of
Eq. (11) around the cut running between the classical
turning points (we label) a0 and a1, namely,

where the ai are the roots of the fourth degree polyno-
mial written in Eq. (17). By looking at the signs of terms
in the polynomial we can see that there can be at most
two real positive roots. Physically we expect there to be
exactly two real positive roots which we have called a0
and a1. These are the classical turning points of the mo-
tion, and represent the furthest and nearest approaches
of the particles.

Furthermore, in the system we are working with, for
typical values of parameters, we ﬁnd that all roots are
real, with two positive and two negative. We may then

canonical choice of phase for the square root on the cut
between a0 and a1 is i and so the period in Eq. (12) is

argument.

One of the most striking experimental surprises of the
two identical ion system is the discovery of cyclotron
mode-locking6. In these events the two frequency traces
corresponding (approximately) to the individual ions mo-
tions meld into one trace. This visible trace is the cen-
ter of mass motion of the dark state. Our analysis in-
dicates that there is another invisible (as a dipole) fre-
quency branch associated with the inter-ion motion and
that it has frequency 2π
T with T of Eq. (13). For the case
of two protons in a typical precision Penning trap (at
5x108) we ﬁnd that Eq. (13) yields frequencies are
ω0 ∼
some tens of Hertz diﬀerent than ω0. It would be an inter-
esting test to apply a sequence of dipole and quadrupolar
ﬁelds to make transitions between dark states and (visi-
ble) center of mass states.

By standard means we now derive explicit formulae
for the shape of the dark state orbits. Recall that, by

Note directly from Eq. (16) and Eq. (18) that the pre-
cession of these orbits is given by twice the RHS Eq. (16)
with each incomplete elliptic functions replaced by its
complete elliptic counterpart.

We have completed a numerical simulation of the sys-
tem Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) for a range of initial conditions.
To abet numerical stability those equations were rewrit-
ten in the co-rotating frame and integrated using com-
mercial (IDLtm) routines on a DEC Alpha workstation.
Some of these IDLtm programs link compiled versions of
CERN’s Mathlib elliptic function routines. The results
from a typical run are shown in Figures 1 (resp. 2) where
both the u0 of Eq. (6) (resp. L0 of Eq. (8)) are plotted
as functions of time.

The ﬁgures show that initially the motions of the ions
are essentially independent as the energy dissipates. Dur-
ing this regime the total energy of the system is split
between the center of mass motion and the inter-ion mo-
tion. Note that due to the large dynamic range of these
simulations we have plotted the logarithm of the energy.
Thus, the linear decay of the envelope of the inter-ion en-
ergy u0 in this initial regime is the exponential damping
of the energy of the system as a whole.

Eventually the center of charge motion damps away
appreciably and the remaining inter-ion motion persists.
As described earlier, in real experiments of this type the
dark state we are describing is likely to be eﬀectively the
ﬁnal state since we expect the inter-ion motion to decay
via quadrupole radiation on a timescale long compared
with typical two-ion experiments. For our simulation this
ﬁnal state is reached at simulated time 150, after which
both u0 and L0 are essentially constant (up to numerical
accuracy of the simulations).

In conclusion, we have derived closed form analytic for-
mulae for the dark state of two identical ions in a Pen-
ning trap. To ﬁnd this solution, we assumed that the
pair is near the center of the trap (we have completely
neglected the eﬀect of the trap’s electrostatic ﬁelds) and
that the motion of the ions is conﬁned to the same az-

analysis the eﬀects of the trap’s electric ﬁeld and also a
ﬁxed average vertical oﬀset between the cyclotron planes
of the ions. This results in formulae for the two integrals
of motion that have additional terms compared with the
Eq. (6) and Eq. (8). However, the resulting equations of
motion for the dark state are no longer solvable in terms
of known functions.

We solve the hydrodynamic-ballistic equations of motion
for a one-dimensional time-dependent Thomas-Fermi model
of Cl2 exposed to an intense subpicosecond laser ﬁeld, and
observe simultaneous multielectron ionization and molecular
dissociation. The fragment kinetic energy defect with respect
to the simple Coulomb explosion picture is found to originate
in ejected-electron screening of the escaping fragments;
its
magnitude agrees with that observed in recent experiments.

Molecules exposed to intense (I > 1013 W cm−2) sub-
picosecond laser pulses undergo multiple ionization ac-
companied by dissociation, a process denoted by multi-
electron dissociative ionization (MEDI) [1–3]. The sim-
plest picture of MEDI is that of the ”Coulomb explo-
sion,” in which the laser ﬁeld quickly strips a number of
electrons from the molecule, and the charged ionic frag-
ments then dissociate under the inﬂuence of the repulsive
Coulomb potential. In this picture, the total kinetic en-
ergy of the fragment pair with charges q1e, q2e should
be equal to T = q1q2e2/(4πǫ0Re) (SI units), where q1
and q2 are integers, e is the elementary charge, and Re
is the equilibrium internuclear separation of the neutral
molecule.

In experiments, however, it is found that the fragment
kinetic energies are consistently lower than those pre-
dicted by the Coulomb explosion model, by an amount
called the kinetic energy defect, ∆. This appears to be
true for all observed fragmentation channels, and does
not depend much on other experimental parameters such
as laser wavelength and pulse duration. The fragment
energies are instead consistent with a Coulomb explosion
at a value of R some 20-50% greater than Re. However,
since the characteristic time scale for molecular internu-
clear motion (a vibrational period) is long compared to
the time scale on which strong-ﬁeld multiple ionization
occurs, it is diﬃcult to see how a simple Coulomb explo-
sion picture could be applicable.

This Letter puts forth a simple explanation of these
MEDI observations, and supports it by numerical calcu-

lations applied to a model molecule. A Coulomb explo-
sion is initiated at Re, when the most loosely-bound elec-
trons are stripped from the molecule, but the ejected elec-
tron cloud does not expand rapidly. Ionization continues
until only a tightly-bound electronic core remains, and is
then shut oﬀ by the strong internal molecular ﬁeld (al-
though for very intense radiation there may be some sub-
sequent ionization of the separated fragments, i.e. post-
dissociation ionization (PDI)). Most electron stripping
thus occurs near R ≈ Re, so one sees a brief interval of
acceleration of the ionic fragments by increasing mutual
Coulomb repulsion. However, when the ionization shuts
oﬀ, a countervailing decelerating tendency becomes ap-
parent: as the fragments separate through the ejected
electron cloud, more electronic charge is encompassed by
the increasing internuclear separation R(t), and the resul-
tant screening slows the fragments. This post-explosion
screening gives a value of ∆ consistent with that observed
in experiments. Charge-symmetric fragmentation is con-
ﬁrmed [4] to be a major channel of dissociation. These
conclusions diﬀer from those of other models that have
been proposed recently [2,4–6].

We have done calculations to illustrate this picture,
by solving the time-dependent equations of motion for
the nuclei and electrons of a model Cl2 molecule in a
strong laser ﬁeld. All electrons are treated explicitly, via
time-dependent density functional theory. We know of no
previous treatment of molecules in strong ﬁelds that deals
explicitly with more than one electron. Our approach is
made as follows.

In strong-ﬁeld laser irradiation of diatomic molecules,
it is believed [6] that the molecular axis is quickly aligned
with the polarization vector of the radiation ﬁeld, so that
the ionization process can be modelled with the molecu-
lar axis parallel to the electric ﬁeld. To simplify the nu-
merical calculations, we make the additional approxima-
tion of conﬁning all particles in the system to move in one
dimension, deﬁned by this axis. This approximation has
been used to model strong-ﬁeld interaction with one-and
two-electron atoms [7] and with the H+
2 molecule [8], and
it has replicated much of the essential physics of three-
dimensional systems. We utilize time-dependent den-

1

sity functional theory to deal directly with the electron
density vs. the many-electron Schr¨odinger wavefunction.
We have previously applied time-dependent density func-
tional theory to treat three-dimensional atoms in strong
radiation ﬁelds [9], and obtained results for multiple elec-
tron ionization that agree well with experiments.

The electron density of the molecule is described as a
ﬂuid of mass density ρ(x, t), with an associated velocity
ﬁeld v(x, t), which obey the equations of motion:

The ﬁrst of the eqs. (1) is the usual continuity equa-
tion. The second is the classical equation of motion for
an inﬁnitesimal element of ﬂuid subject to forces due to
the gradients of an electrostatic potential Φ and a pres-
sure P = −(∂U/∂x)s, where U is the internal energy
density of the ﬂuid. The eﬀects of quantum mechanics in
this equation must be expressed by a constitutive relation
between P and ρ. Such a relation was derived in a semi-
classical approximation by Thomas and Fermi (TF) [10];
its variants have been used to investigate the ground state
properties of atoms [11,12] and weak-ﬁeld atomic radia-
tive response [13]. The TF model treats the electrons
as a Fermi gas at temperature T = 0, and determines
the energy of the gas by ﬁlling the available phase-space
volume, subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. This
gives U of the three-dimensional electron gas as a local
function of the density, of the form U (r) ∼ ρ(r)5/3.

We have sought a corresponding relationship applica-
ble to the one-dimensional many-electron system. The
Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [14] ensures that the energy
of a stationary one-dimensional system is a functional of
the electron density, but the semiclassical TF arguments
may not provide a good approximation to the true en-
ergy functional. Experimentation with possible forms of
the functional leads us to propose the following expres-
sion for the energy density of a one-dimensional electron
gas, U (x) = An2(x), where n(x) is the electron density
function (n(x) = ρ(x)/m), and A is a universal constant.
The value of A is determined by requiring that it give
reasonable physical properties (binding energies, etc.) of
the model systems. Such an expression is also obtained
by applying the semiclassical method in two dimensions
[15].

In treating Coulomb interactions in one dimension, it
is necessary to eliminate the singularity in the potential
at x = 0. We follow a standard procedure [7,8], and
write the electrostatic potential Φ of our model diatomic
molecule as

Φ =

(2)

Here Z is the atomic number and x1(t), x2(t) are po-
sitions of the two nuclei. The parameters b, c serve to
smooth the Coulomb interaction at points of coalescence.
By solving the static case of eq. 1, we obtain the lin-
ear relationship, n(x) = eΦ(x)/(2A), which provides an
integral equation for the electrostatic potential of the
Its linearity allows us
time-independent solution [16].
to construct the solution for a many-atom system by lin-
ear combination of appropriately shifted single-atom so-
lutions. It is easy to show that the parameters A, b, and c
are not independent [16]: A = e2 ln(c/b). Thus we always
have c > b. Furthermore, our numerical calculations of
values of Re and D for various values of Z indicate that
the value of A must be essentially independent of Z, and
that A = 0.3 a.u.
[in the usual atomic units (a.u.) in
which the numerical values of the electron mass m, the
elementary charge e, and reduced Planck’s constant ¯h are
equal to unity]. If A lies outside a narrow band of values
around 0.3 a.u., one obtains unreasonable values of Re
and D.

We have applied this model to describe the Cl2 (Z =
17) molecule in a strong radiation ﬁeld. By solving the
static equation as a function of internuclear distance, we
ﬁnd the Born-Oppenheimer potential curves for Cl2 and
Cl+2
2 displayed in Fig. 1. These results were obtained
with the parameter set (A = 0.3 a.u., b = 1.22 a.u.,
c = 1.65 a.u.) which yields Re = 3.8 a.u. and D = 0.11
a.u., in agreement with the experimental values [17] of
Re = 3.76 a.u. and D = 0.091 a.u. respectively.

We treat the time-dependent system by adding the
electric dipole interaction with the radiation ﬁeld to (2),
and solving the hydrodynamic equations for the elec-
tronic density simultaneously with the classical equations
of motion for the positions of the nuclei. We treat the
equations (1) as an initial value problem, with the density
ρ(x, t = 0) given by the static solution, and the nuclei ini-
tially at rest and separated by Re. The ﬁrst check of the
time-dependent method is to verify that it reproduces
molecular vibrations when no external ﬁeld is present.
That it does is shown in the inset of Fig. 1, which dis-
plays the free oscillation of the internuclear distance in
the absence of a radiation ﬁeld. The period of oscilla-
tion of 34 fs is shorter than the experimental value [17]
of 59 fs, so our model overestimates the stiﬀness of the
molecular potential at Re.

We now discuss the eﬀects of an intense subpicosecond
laser pulse on this system. The laser frequency of ω =
0.0746 a.u. (wavelength λ = 610 nm), is that used in
the experiments of refs. [2,3]. The laser pulse is turned
on with a sin2(πt/(2τ )) ramp; we treat short-pulse and
long-pulse cases in which the ramp time τ is 10 or 70
optical periods T (20 or 140 fs) respectively.

Fig.

2 shows short-pulse results for a peak ﬁeld
strength Fp = 0.6 a.u. (corresponding to a laser intensity
I = 1.3 × 1016 W cm−2). The inset to Fig. 2 (a) shows
the Coulomb explosion: the nuclei remain essentially at
rest until a time just before Fp is reached; then there is
rapid acceleration (increase in cycle-averaged kinetic en-

2

ergy) during an interval of about 10 T ; and then a gradual
deceleration. The dynamics of this system can be read-
ily understood in terms of the time dependence of the
charge distribution, which is summarized in Fig. 2(b).
The lowest, nearly straight line, labelled ”grid” displays
the total electric charge on our grid, and thus represents
the number of electrons that have been absorbed at the
boundaries; the ”atomic ion” value consists of the charge
within 3 a.u. of either of the ionic fragments, which is
seen to be a good long-time indicator of the charge lo-
calized on that fragment; and ”molecular ion” indicates
the sum of the two atomic ion charges, plus all charge
in between. We can see that by the time the molecu-
lar and atomic ions have settled into steady behavior, at
t ≈ 20T , no charge has been absorbed at the walls of our
box; the gradual departure of charge from the system at
later times does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect them. Note that
the ﬁnal charge state of each atom is +4, whereas that of
the ”molecule” is +5. Thus there are three units of neg-
ative charge (electrons) left in the space between the two
fragments, which screen their mutual Coulomb repulsion.
The molecular charge is seen to show a sudden de-
crease at t ≈ 10T , which corresponds to an increase in
the enclosed number of electrons. This results from two
eﬀects: the shutoﬀ of molecular ionization; and the in-
creasing distance between the fragments, so that more of
the ejected electron cloud lies between them. It is not
due to a rescattering mechanism, which would occur on
the time scale of 1 ﬁeld period. The mechanism of ioniza-
tion shutoﬀ is shown in Fig. 3, which displays snapshots
of the self-consistent molecular potential eΦ(x, t) early
in the pulse. The two atomic potential wells are super-
posed on the linear potential of the electric ﬁeld, which
oscillates in time. Electronic charge on the sides of the
atomic wells or in the interestitial region will be stripped
oﬀ early in the pulse, since there is no barrier to its es-
cape. However, by t = 8.75T the loosely-bound charge
is gone, and the remaining charge is stuck in the atomic
wells (tunneling does not occur in our model; it would be
slow in real systems under these conditions). The shutoﬀ
of the ionization thus stops the molecular charge from in-
creasing; the actual decrease of charge that follows is due
to the enclosure of previously-ejected electronic charge
between the separating ion fragments. Comparison of
frames (a) and (b) of Fig. 2 shows that roughly two
units of electronic charge are added to the molecule in
this way within about 20 fs (10 T ) after ionization shut-
oﬀ, at which time the deceleration begins. This results
in ∆ ≈ 20 eV, in agreement with the experiments of ref.
[2,3].

For completeness we make some observations on long-
pulse case. If the ramp of the pulse is increased, we see
essentially the same deceleration mechanism as in the
short-pulse case, although PDI occurs at high intensities.
Fig. 4 shows molecular charges for two intensities, at the
same frequency as in Fig. 2, but with a ramp time of
140 fs. At both intensities we see a knee in the curve
similar to that in Fig. 2, and it occurs at about the same

value of instantaneous ﬁeld strength. However, at the
higher intensity, the knee represents only a temporary
disruption of ionization, and PDI occurs as the ﬁeld rises
to its peak strength.

In conclusion, we have presented the ﬁrst dynamical
model of MEDI. The results are in qualitative agreement
with experimental data. Reproducing the main features
of the experiments, the model does not support the idea
of stabilization [2], nor does it attribue much importance
to the enhanced ionization at some critical distance [6].
We predict some post-dissociation ionization for longer,
picosecond pulses with peak intensities above 1016 W
cm−2. This could be tested experimentally.

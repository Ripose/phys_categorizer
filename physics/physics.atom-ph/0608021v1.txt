Abstract— We propose a novel experiment based on atoms
trapped close to a macroscopic surface, to study the interactions
between the atoms and the surface at very small separations (0.6
to 10 µm). In this range the dominant potential is the QED
interaction (Casimir-Polder and Van der Waals) between the
surface and the atom. Additionally, several theoretical models
suggest the possibility of Yukawa type potentials with sub-mm
range, arising from new physics related to gravity. We propose a
set-up very similar to neutral atom optical lattice clocks, but with
the atoms trapped in lattice sites close to the reﬂecting mirror. A
sequence of pulses of the probe laser at different frequencies is
then used to create an interferometer with a coherent superposi-
tion between atomic states at different distances from the mirror
(in different lattice sites). Assuming atom interferometry state of
the art measurement of the phase difference and a duration of the
superposition of about 0.1 s we expect to be able to measure the
potential difference between separated states with an uncertainty
of about 10−4 Hz. A preliminary analysis of systematic effects
for different atoms (Sr, Yb, Rb, Cs) indicates no fundamentally
limiting effect at the same level of uncertainty, but does inﬂuence
the choice of atom and isotope. Based on those estimates, we
expect that such an experiment would improve the best existing
measurements of the atom-wall QED interaction by ≥2 orders
of magnitude, whilst gaining up to 4 orders of magnitude on the
best present limits on new interactions in the range between 100
nm and 100 µm.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the frontiers of modern physics is the study of forces
at very small length scales (< 1 mm). From the theoretical
point of view, such length scales are the domain where QED
interactions (Casimir type forces) become important and where
several recent theoretical ideas point to the possibility of new
interactions related to gravity ([1], [2] and references therein).
On the experimental side, measurements at distances ranging
from 10−8 m to 10−3 m have been the domain of micro-
electromechanical systems (MEMS) and of torsion balance
experiments ([2], [3], [4], [1] and references therein). Two
major difﬁculties of such mechanical experiments is the exact
knowledge of the geometry of the setup (distance, surface
roughness, etc...) and the precise measurement of the very
small forces involved. A promising alternative that might
provide a way around those difﬁculties is the use of cold
atoms.

Over the last decade or so this idea has lead to a number
of proposals and experiments that explore interactions at very
short range using the metrological advantages of cold atoms
and Bose Einstein condensates (BEC). The experiments that

have been carried out so far [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11],
[12] all conﬁrm the theoretical predictions from QED (Van der
Waals and Casimir-Polder effect) at distances ranging from a
few tens of nanometers to several microns, however, none of
them have yet reached the uncertainties achieved by the best
mechanical measurements.

A promising technique to improve on those results is the use
of cold atoms trapped in a standing wave close to a macro-
scopic surface as proposed in [1], [13], [14]. In these schemes
BECs or cold atoms are trapped coherently in several potential
wells of the standing wave close to the surface and released
after an interaction time T . The differing potential in the wells
as a function of distance from the surface leads to a phase
difference cumulated during T . This phase difference is then
observed via imaging of the interference pattern once the trap
is switched off and the BECs expand [1], or more realistically
by observing the period of Bloch oscillations induced by the
presence of gravity [13], [14]. A similar scheme has already
been used for one of the most accurate determinations of the
ﬁne structure constant via the measurement of ¯h/mRb that
governs the period of Bloch oscillations [15], [16].

In this paper we pursue a similar idea (atoms trapped in
a standing wave close to the surface) but propose a new
scheme that has the advantage of providing accurate con-
trol of the position of the atoms and accurate detection of
the cumulated phase difference, which in turn allows for a
sensitive determination of the atom-surface separation and of
the potential difference between the wells. This is achieved
by a sequence of laser pulses at different frequencies that
allow the creation of an interferometer with separated spatial
paths (passing through different wells) and using two different
internal states of the atom. The readout of the phase difference
is then simply the detection of the internal state populations
(similar to atomic clocks). The involved technology is very
similar to that of existing setups for optical lattice clocks
[17], [18], [19], [20], [21] that have been built over the last
years and are now operating in several laboratories around the
world, which makes this a promising idea for the near future
as experiments can draw from that experience. Most of those
clocks are operating using 87Sr at a lattice laser wavelength
of 813 nm and all numerical values throughout the paper are
given for that case, except when explicitly stated otherwise.

We ﬁrst recall (section II) the relevant results of a previous
paper [22] in which we have studied the use of Wannier-Stark

(WS) states in an accelerated periodic potential to reduce the
required trap depth in optical lattice clocks, followed by their
application to the control of atoms in an optical lattice in
the presence of gravity (section III). We then describe the
proposed experiment and its potential statistical uncertainty
in section IV. With that in mind we investigate potential
perturbing effects (section V) and ﬁnally study the resulting
interest of the measurement in fundamental physics in sections
VI and VII.

II. GENERAL THEORY

We consider two level atoms trapped in a vertical standing
wave with wave vector kl
in the presence of gravity. The
trapping laser is red-detuned from resonance which leads to
trapping of the atoms at the maxima of intensity. Transverse
conﬁnement is provided by the Gaussian proﬁle of the vertical
laser or by a 3D lattice, adding two horizontal standing waves.
The internal atomic structure is approximated by a two-level
with energy difference ¯hωeg. The internal

The Hamiltonian (5) supports no true bound states, as an
atom initially conﬁned in one well of the lattice will end up in
the continuum due to tunneling under the inﬂuence of gravity,

an effect known as Landau-Zener tunneling. However, in the
case of Sr in an optical lattice, and for U0 as low as 5 Er the
timescale for this effect is about 1010 s for atoms in the lowest
lying state, so it can be safely neglected for our purposes.

As shown in [22] under these conditions the Eigenstates of
ˆHext are the so called Wannier-Stark (WS) states
known
from solid state physics [23]. In the position representation
exhibits a main peak in the mth well of the lattice

|
and small revivals in adjacent wells (see ﬁgure 1). These
revivals decrease exponentially at increasing lattice depth. At
U0 = 10 Er the ﬁrst revival is already a hundred times
smaller than the main peak, which indicates strong localization
in the mth well. The discrete quantum number m is the
”well index” characterizing the well containing the main peak
. As intuitively expected, the
of the wave function
energy separation between adjacent states is simply the change
in gravitational potential between adjacent wells: ¯h∆g =
magλl/2 (see [22] for details, for our case ∆g/2π
866 Hz),
which leads to a Wannier Stark ladder of Eigenstates as shown
on ﬁgure 2.

We note that at realistic lattice depths of a few Er the

implies that for a given probe laser intensity the two processes
are equally likely, governed only by the frequency of the
probe laser. For a probe laser linewidth that is signiﬁcantly
narrower than ∆g (866 Hz) atoms remain in the same well
when the probe laser is on resonance (ω = ωeg), climb one
step up the WS-ladder when ω = ωeg + ∆g or one step down
∆g. These processes can be very efﬁcient:

IV. PRINCIPLE OF THE EXPERIMENT

The experimental setup is sketched in ﬁgure 4 and is to
some extent very similar to the setups used in optical lattice
clocks [21] or for the measurement of Bloch oscillations [16],
[14]. The atoms are trapped in a vertical optical lattice with
horizontal conﬁnement provided by the Gaussian shape of the
vertical trap laser or additional horizontal beams forming a
3D lattice. The probe laser is aligned and overlapped with the
vertical trap laser. Typically, about 103 to 104 atoms per lattice
site are trapped and cooled to a few µK.

and cleaning all remaining

The main experimental difference of the scheme proposed
here with respect to existing setups is that atoms need to
be trapped in lattice sites close to one of the mirrors of the
vertical trap laser, and that provisions have to be made for
selecting atoms in a single vertical well. The latter can be
achieved by several means, all based on selective pumping of
atoms from
states
using a pusher beam. For example, a second vertical lattice
superimposed onto the ﬁrst one but of different period would
induce an additional lightshift dependent on the well index.
Atoms in the maximally (or minimally) light-shifted wells are
by a properly tuned probe pulse
then selectively shelved to
e
i
while atoms populating all the other wells and remaining in
g
i
are cleared by the pusher beam. Depending on the period ratio
of both lattices and on the number of wells initially populated,
this leaves atoms in only one well or in a few wells separated
by a known number of sites. In addition since both lattices are
generated by reﬂection on the same surface the index of the
populated well(s) with respect to this surface can be known

unambiguously. Quite generally, this type of scheme can be
used in the presence of any potential whose spatial gradient

Once atoms in a particular well are selected,

they are
transferred to the well of interest (at the distance at which the
measurement is to take place) using a sequence of π pulses
of the probe laser detuned by
∆g to move up or down the

WS-ladder as described in section III. An interferometer is
then created around that well using the following sequence

As can be seen from equation (7) the phase difference
depends on the interactions times Ti which leads to inter-
ference fringes as a function of T1 + T2 at either output
of the interferometer i.e. when measuring the internal state
populations Pe or Pg after the last π/2 pulse. The signal of
interest is in the ﬁrst term of (7) allowing the determination
of ma/¯h and g (analogue of the measurements reported in
[16], [24], [25], [14]) or the measurement of any additional
potential U that varies over the size of the interferometer. The
scheme can be modiﬁed to adapt to the size of the spatial
variation of U by adding additional π pulses detuned by
∆g

The terms in the second and third lines of (7) point to
potential sources of uncertainty. In an ideal experiment the
internal state separation ωeg is spatially homogeneous and
all pulses of the probe laser are phase coherent, leading to
cancelation of those terms (when choosing T1 = T2). In
reality, perturbations of ωeg are inhomogeneous (magnetic
effects, light shifts, collisional shifts, etc...), which leads to
imperfect cancelation of the two terms in the second line of

V. PERTURBATIONS

For this section we will extend the discussion to a range
of atoms, as the effect of some perturbations will signiﬁcantly
depend on the atom and isotope used. More precisely, we will
consider two conﬁguration for our interferometer using two
level atoms in an optical lattice: the hyperﬁne splitting of the
ground state of Rb and Cs with counter propagating Raman
3P0 optical
pulses as the probe laser [15], [16], and 1S0 ↔
transitions in Sr and Yb [17], [18], [19], [20]. Throughout the
section we will investigate the potential perturbations with a
10−4 rad goal of overall uncertainty on the measurement
10−4 Hz in

≈
of ∆φ in (7) corresponding to perturbations of
frequency.

≤

A. Phase coherence of the probe laser

The third line in (7) characterizes the effect of a phase
incoherence of the different probe laser pulses. Assuming a
cycle time of the experiment of 1 s and data integration over
104 s, the 10−4 rad goal implies a phase stability of the probe
10−2 rad over timescales of order 0.1 s, with no
laser of
10−4 rad) that are synchronous with the cycle
perturbations (
time of the experiment.

≈

≥

When using Raman pulses with hyperﬁne transitions in Rb
or Cs only the difference (GHz frequency) of the counter
propagating Raman beams needs to be controlled at that level.
This can be achieved when carefully controlling the microwave
signal used to generate that difference. Also a second atomic
cloud (see below) can be used if required.

For the optical transitions in Sr and Yb the required phase
coherence is difﬁcult to achieve. The most promising approach
is to use a second cloud of atoms in the same lattice (subjected
to the same probe laser pulses) but far from the surface as a
phase reference that allows to correct for the phase variations
of the probe laser. Even in that case a phase coherence of about
0.1 rad is still required in order to unambiguously identify the
central interference fringe in the measurement. Nonetheless,
using this method a compensation of the phase ﬂuctuations of
the probe laser at the required level seems possible but remains
a challenging task.

B. Light shifts

Light shifts from the lattice laser will affect the measured
phase difference in two ways. Firstly the induced modiﬁcation
of the transition frequency ωeg leads to imperfect cancelation
of the two terms in the second line of (7) if the lattice laser
intensity (and hence the induced light shift) varies in time
= ω(m−1)
between T1 and T2 and/or in space (ω(m+1)
).
Secondly a spatial variation of the intensity over the size of
the interferometer will lead to a modiﬁcation of the energy
difference between the
states in the different wells, which
g
|
modiﬁes the (Um+1 −
Um−1) difference in (7). The involved
energy shifts are rather large when compared to the 10−4 Hz

eg

eg

i

6
goal, e.g. for Sr in a 5 Er deep lattice the light shift of the
g
i
state is about 20 kHz, which implies that the spatial variation
of the lattice laser intensity needs to be controlled at the 10−8
level.

|

For Rb and Cs the modiﬁcation of the hyperﬁne transition
frequency ωeg is given by the difference of the light shifts
of the two hyperﬁne states and is therefore about a factor
10−5 smaller than the shift of each state 1. Thus
ωhf /ωopt ≈
a relatively modest spatial (0.1 to 100 µm) and temporal (0.1 s)
stability of the lattice laser at the 10−4 level is sufﬁcient. How-
states is affected by the full
ever, the induced shift of the
g
|
i
light shift, and therefore the spatial variation of intensity over
the lattice sites of interest needs to be controlled to about 10−8.
For a quantitative estimate we will examine this effect for the
experiment reported in [16]. In the picture of Bloch oscillations
used in [16] a spatial variation of the trap laser intensity leads
to a modiﬁcation of the vertical wave vector kl (kB in [16]) as
a function of vertical position, which modiﬁes the momentum
transferred by the Bloch oscillations. The results of [16] are
10−8. In our case, the separation
consistent with δkl/kl ≤
900 Hz), so
of adjacent WS states ∆g = magπ/(¯hkl) (
the 10−8 uncertainty on kl leads to a contribution of about
10−5 Hz, which is sufﬁcient for our purposes. However, some
caution is necessary when directly applying the results of [16]
to our case: Firstly in [16] intensity variations are averaged
over several wells as the atoms are delocalised. Secondly,
and more importantly, controlling the intensity close to a
reﬂecting surface is certainly more difﬁcult than far from the
surface (stray reﬂections, spurious modes, etc...). Nonetheless
the results of [16] provide a good indication that light shifts
due to spatial intensity ﬂuctuations should be controllable at
the required level.

≈

|

i

g

For Sr and Yb the same conclusions apply concerning the
shifts of the
states in the different wells. Concerning
the spatial and temporal modiﬁcation of ωeg the problem is
completely solved when the optical lattice is operated at the so-
called ”magic wavelength”, which leads to insensitivity of ωeg
to the trap laser intensity to ﬁrst order, and totally negligible
higher order effects [19].

Finally, light shifts from wave front curvature and the Gouy
phase have been studied in [16] and found to be consistent
10−8, which again means that they should be
with δkl/kl ≤
compatible with the 10−4 Hz uncertainty considered here.

C. Collisional shift

The interaction between atoms will affect the atomic energy
levels as a function of the atomic density. As for the light
shifts of the previous section, the effect will be two-fold, a
modiﬁcation of the transition frequency ωeg (second line of
(7)) and a modiﬁcation of the ground state energy difference
((Um+1 −
For some bosonic isotopes considered here the dependence
of ωeg on density has been measured. It is reported in table I

1For example, in Cs the shift of ωeg is measured to be 4.6 × 10−5 of the

shift of |gi as obtained from the measured static polarizability [26], [27].

not be the case when using another transition or for other
bosonic isotopes in Sr or Yb.

For fermionic isotopes collisional effects are expected to be
orders of magnitude smaller (when spin polarized) due to the
Pauli exclusion principle. In Sr and Yb fermionic isotopes are
abundant (87Sr, 171Yb, 173Yb) which provides the possibility
of carrying out the experiment using fermions.

D. Knowledge of magλl/¯h

A 10−4 rad measurement of ∆φ requires the knowledge of
the ﬁrst term in (7) at or below the 10−7 level in relative
uncertainty.

10−8 [16], and ¯h/mCs with 1.6

For ¯h/ma this is already achieved for several atoms. For
example ¯h/mRb is determined with a relative uncertainty of
10−8 [37]. Even if this
1.4
were not the case, the experiment itself could be used to ﬁrst

The trap laser wavelength λl can be known to much better
than 10−7 even with modest stabilization and measurement
techniques.

The absolute value of local gravity g needs to be determined
at the location of the atoms, including any vibrations and
other perturbations (tides, gravity gradient, etc...). Absolute
gravimeters routinely reach < 10−8 g uncertainty, vibration

E. Stray electric and magnetic ﬁelds

One of the most signiﬁcant error sources in the mea-
surement reported in [12] are stray electric and magnetic
ﬁelds originating from contaminations of the surface. The
resulting normalized perturbation of the measured center of
mass oscillation of the BEC is of the order 10−5 (see table I
in [12]), corresponding to an uncertainty of around 10−2 Hz
on the measurement of a potential with r−4 dependence (e.g.
Casimir-Polder potential, UCP ) at a distance of
7.5 µm from
the surface. The surface charges responsible for the effect are
either spurious charges (especially when using an insulating
surface) or dipoles on the surface created by adsorbed atoms
(especially for conducting and semiconducting surfaces) as
extensively studied in [38].

≈

It

is difﬁcult

to realistically estimate the corresponding
effect for our case because of the different experimental
conditions that signiﬁcantly affect the stray ﬁelds (number
of ”stray” atoms, necessity for high vacuum, used surfaces
and atoms, etc...). However, we believe that most of these
differences lead to less sensitivity to stray ﬁelds (see below)
with good hope of controlling them to the required level,
especially at relatively large distances from the surface (5 to
10 µm).

As noted in [12] conducting or semiconducting surfaces
would be preferable to insulators largely because they are
less susceptible to electric ﬁelds caused by spurious surface
charges. However, they were not used because of Rb atoms
sticking to the surface and creating electric dipoles [38]. In our
case this is likely to be less of a problem for several reasons:
The vacuum in the proposed experiment will be about 100
times lower than for typical BEC experiments, which means
that it is possible to keep the surface clean by heating it to
temperatures that are incompatible with the ultra high vacuum
required for BECs. The total number of atoms required to
produce a BEC is about 103 times larger than for the case
of µK atoms in an optical lattice (for the same number of
trapped atoms), which implies that less atoms will adsorb onto
the surface in our case. Also, other means for protecting the
surface against adsorption could be used, e.g. a blue-detuned
evanescent wave like in [6], and ﬁnally for non-alkaline atoms
(Sr, Yb) the strength of the dipoles created by adsorption might
be signiﬁcantly less than for Rb studied in [38].

Concerning magnetic ﬁelds, in [12] it was not possible to
apply an external magnetic ﬁeld in order to detect their effect
(analogously to the method used for the E-ﬁeld) because of
the magnetic trap used for the BEC. This is not the case
for the purely optical trap proposed here, so characterization
of magnetic effects is likely to be more precise than in
[12], especially for isotopes with non-zero nuclear angular
momentum (133Cs, 85,87Rb, 87Sr, 171,173Yb) as the different
mF states can then be used to measure the magnetic ﬁelds ”in
situ”.

F. Knowledge of the atom-surface separation

The uncertainty of any measurement of atom-surface inter-
actions depends crucially on the precise determination of the

distance between the atom and the surface. For example, a %
measurement of the Casimir-Polder potential (UCP ) requires
a 10−3 uncertainty on r (due to the r−4 dependence of UCP ),
which at the short distances involved is no trivial task. In
the most recent experiment [12] at relatively large distances
(6
10 µm) the uncertainties on r are around 0.2 µm (see
ﬁgure 2 in [12]) which implies a limit of about 10 % on the
measurement of UCP .

−

This is where we see the main advantage of the method
proposed here. The precise knowledge of the external state of
the atoms localized in WS states, and of the position of the
optical lattice with respect to the surface allows a relatively
accurate determination of the position of the WS states (and
hence of the atoms) with respect to the reﬂecting surface.

The uncertainty of the trap laser wavelength contributes
negligibly to δr (below a picometre), but the characterization
of its wave-fronts may have a larger effect. Over the small
extension of the trapped atoms (
100µm) it should be
possible to control wave front curvatures to about 10−3 λl
leading to δr
0.8 nm. However, interference between the
trap laser and stray reﬂections due to surface roughness may
play a non-negligible role [39], [40].

≈

≈

≈

Other effects could come from the surface itself. Surface
roughness contributes to
0.5 nm [12] and is the dominant
effect. The effective optical reﬂecting surface may be different
from the physical surface, but that effect should be similar for
the trap laser and the QED modes that constitute UCP , and
therefore cancel to some extent in the measurement of UCP .
For the search of new interactions (section 10) that cancelation
does not take place but the requirements on δr are much less
stringent (in fact determined by the necessity to correct for
UCP ).

Thus, we believe that our experimental method will allow
the control of the atom-surface separation to
1 nm, limited
by the surface roughness and the wave-front imperfections of
the lattice.

≈

In summary, the effect of the perturbations discussed above
will depend signiﬁcantly on the choices made for the atoms
and the surface. Our estimate for the collisional shift seems
to exclude many bosonic isotopes but is unlikely to affect
fermionic isotopes of Sr or Yb, and the likely effect of stray
magnetic and electric ﬁelds seems to favor a conducting or
semiconducting surface. Under those conditions a control of
all perturbations of ∆φ in (7) at the 10−4 rad level seems
possible but remains challenging, especially concerning the
phase coherence of the probe laser and the control of stray
electromagnetic ﬁelds. We therefore take this value as the basis
for the discussion of the scientiﬁc interest of the experiment
in the next two sections, but note that even with performances
that are up to two or three orders of magnitude less (using Rb
for example), the experiment would still be of interest when
compared to previous measurements (see sections VI, VII)
whilst using an experimental approach that is fundamentally
different from previous mechanical measurements, which is of
essence in experimental investigations of fundamental physics.

VI. QED INTERACTION

After its prediction in 1948 [41], the Casimir force has
been observed in a number of ”historic” experiments which
conﬁrmed its existence and main properties [42], [43], [44],
[45]. More recent measurements [46] with largely improved
accuracy have allowed for comparison between measured
values of the force and theoretical predictions at the few %
level. This comparison is interesting because the Casimir force
is the most accessible effect of vacuum ﬂuctuations in the
macroscopic world. As the existence of vacuum energy raises
difﬁculties at the interface between the theories of quantum
and gravitational phenomena, it is worth testing this effect
with the greatest care and highest accuracy [47], [48].

Shortly after the prediction of the Casimir force between
two parallel plates, Casimir and Polder [49] predicted the
analogous attractive force between an atom and a macroscopic
plane surface. The corresponding potential is known as the
Casimir-Polder potential UCP and is described to ﬁrst approx-
imation (zero temperature, perfect conducting surface, only
static part of the atomic polarizability, etc...) by

UCP =

3¯hcα0
8πr4

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, α0 is the static
polarizability of the atom, and r is the distance between
the atom and the surface. More generally, the Casimir-Polder
potential is the retarded part of the total QED interaction
UQED between the atom and the surface. The non-retarded
part, which is dominant at short distances, is known as the
”Van der Waals” potential UV dW and has a r−3 dependence.
Also, at non-zero temperatures (and larger distances),
the
overall QED potential becomes dominated by a temperature
dependent term again with r−3 dependence of the form (to
ﬁrst approximation)

(8)

(9)

UT =

kBT α0
4r3

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.
This leads to an interesting phenomenological behavior with
two distance dependent crossover points from r−3 dependence
to r−4 and back. At 300 K the two crossover points are situated
at a few tenths of a micron and a few microns respectively (de-
pending on the atom and surface characteristics). Experiments
that measure the overall QED interaction use cold atoms [6],
[7], [11] or BECs [9], [10], [12]. The experiment by Sukenik
[5] was the ﬁrst to clearly observe the crossover between
UV dW and UCP , whereas the experiment by Harber et al. [12]
has concentrated on the second crossover at larger distances
(from UCP to UT ), without clear evidence so far. Typically,
experiments measuring the atom-wall QED interaction have an
overall relative uncertainty at or above 10 % (e.g. the overall
uncertainty of [6] is estimated to about 30 %).

Our proposed experiment (section IV) measures the poten-
tial difference between two wells separated by a distance of
nλl (2n wells) with n = 1, 2, 3, ... depending on the number of
π pulses applied for the separation of the atoms. For wells that

are close to the surface that potential difference is dominated
by UQED.

Table II shows the contribution from UCP evaluated using
approximations (8) and (9) for Sr atoms in a lattice with
λl = 813 nm. We ﬁrst note that the proposed depth of the
potential wells (U0 = 5Er) corresponds to about 20 kHz,
i.e. less than UCP in the ﬁrst well, which means that atoms
cannot be trapped in that well. Even in the next two wells
or so, UCP is far from being a ”small” perturbation of the
trapping potential and will signiﬁcantly modify the WS states
and transitions probabilities calculated in [22] (see sections II,
III) in the absence of any additional potential. Nonetheless, the
principle of the experiment remains valid but it requires a full
quantum calculation (including UQED) to obtain the correct
WS states and corresponding energy differences, transition
probabilities, etc.... As a result, given the non-negligible shift
of transition frequencies to neighboring wells (
kHz for the
2nd well), some experimental complications may be necessary
when exploring wells very close to the surface, for example,
using simultaneously two slightly detuned probe lasers.

≈

The measurement of UQED using the proposed experiment
is now straightforward. For a measurement at short distance,
we prepare the atoms in the 4th well for example, and then
use the sequence of pulses described in section IV to create a
superposition between wells 3 and 5. Our projected uncertainty
of 10−4 Hz then leads to a measurement of UCP at a relative
uncertainty of about 10−6, with potential for another order of
magnitude improvement when starting in well no. 3 (super-
position between 2 and 4). However, at such short distances
the main limitation will come from the uncertainty on the
determination of the atom-surface separation (δr
1 nm see
section V) which for atoms in well 3 leads to a contribution
of about δU/U = 4δr/r
0.04 and worse when closer to the
surface. At large distances (e.g. for a superposition between
the 26th and 40th well) the effect of UT is about 0.03 Hz,
which implies a measurement at δU/U < 0.01 now limited
by the 10−4 Hz uncertainty in the measurement of U rather
10−3
than the uncertainty in r. The optimum is δU/U
situated at intermediate distances of about 5 microns from the
surface, close to the crossover between (8) and (9) at about
3.6 microns.

≤

≤

≈

Thus, a measurement at optimum distance corresponds to
two orders of magnitude improvement on the experimental
veriﬁcation of UQED between an atom and a macroscopic
surface, down to the 10−3 level in relative uncertainty. This is
of interest, given that theoretical predictions for real conditions

have typical uncertainties of some percent [50] (depending on
how well the material properties of the mirrors are known
[51]), and that recent
theoretical work [52] suggests new
phenomenological behavior of UQED out of thermal equilib-
rium at intermediate and large distances (few microns and
above). Finally, we point out that our method also allows
a complementary measurement using direct spectroscopy of
ωeg as a function of the distance from the surface (clock
operation with atoms prepared in a given well), which allows
the exploration of UQED as a function of distance and internal
state of the atom.

VII. SEARCH FOR NEW INTERACTIONS

The search for deviations from Newtons law of gravitation
has been a recurrent issue for the last three decades. Initially
motivated by the possibility of deviations from standard grav-
ity due to new forces with couplings of the order of that of
gravity [2], the search has been more recently encouraged by
uniﬁcation models which predict the existence of forces up to
105 times stronger than gravity in the 1 µm and 100 µm range
[53], [54]. Even if its results have not met initial hopes for the
observation of a ”ﬁfth force”, the search has greatly improved
understanding of gravitation, generated an impressive body of
new knowledge, and narrowed the remaining open windows
for new fundamental forces.

The hypothetical additional gravitational potential UY uk
is often expressed in the form of a Yukawa potential and
parametrised by a dimensionless coupling strength α relative
to the Newtonian gravitational potential, and a range λ

UY uk = UN (αe−r/λ)

(10)

where UN is the standard Newtonian potential. Experiments
set
limits in the (λ, α) plane, each experiment providing
best limits in the region of λ corresponding to the typical
distances between the masses used. For large λ (105 to
1015 m) limits are provided by artiﬁcial satellite, lunar, and
solar system observations, whereas ranges of 1 m and below
are the domain of laboratory experiments. The knowledge of
UY uk deteriorates rapidly (limits on α increase) for very large
(> 1015 m) and very small (< 10−3 m) ranges, leaving ”open
windows”, of which the small λ one is the focus of this work.
Figures 5 and 6 show the present limits at very short (10−9
to 10−6 m) and short range (10−6 to 10−2 m). At a range of
about 2 microns best limits can only exclude an additional
potential larger than about 1010 times gravity (ﬁgure 6, [55])
with much worse results at shorter distances. Figure 6 also
shows some theoretical predictions, which seem to indicate
that some interesting ranges to explore are between a micron
and a millimeter.

The interest of the experiment proposed here in measuring
such short range potentials is two-fold: the large region of
distances that can be explored by preparing the atoms in
different wells of the optical lattice, and the comparatively
low uncertainty of the measurement itself (measuring directly
the potential rather than the force). For example, with a

measurement in a superposition between the 3rd and 7th wells
(Sr in a lattice with λl = 813 nm, Au surface, T1 + T2 = 0.1 s)
and a measurement uncertainty of 10−4 rad in (7) we obtain
104.8 at λ = 2 µm, around 5 to 6 orders
a limit of α
of magnitude better than previous limits (ﬁgure 6, [55]). At
103.6 at
larger distances (26th and 50th well) the limit is α
λ = 10 µm, about a two orders of magnitude improvement.

≤

≤

Contrary to the measurement of UQED (section VI) the
uncertainty in the knowledge of the atom-surface separation
only plays a minor role as, unless we discover a non-zero
potential, we only set an upper limit on UY uk i.e. we require
1,
that δUY uk/UY uk ≤
largely within our uncertainty (see section V).

1, which implies that δr(r−1 +λ−1)

≤

In fact, the most serious issue when trying to measure UY uk
is the perturbation from UQED, especially at short distances.
Table II shows that for measurements in the 3rd well one needs
to correct and/or cancel the effect of UQED at the 10−6 level
for the 10−4 Hz uncertainty that we aim at, and even when
relatively far from the surface (26th well) a correction at the
% level is still required. We believe that the most reasonable
approach to that limitation is a two stage experiment, starting
with an experiment at relatively large distance (
10 µm) with
the setup described above, and exploring shorter separations
in a second stage where experimental precautions are taken to
cancel and control UQED at the required level.

≥

For the ﬁrst stage, UQED needs to be calculated and cor-
rected at the % level to reach the required 10−4 Hz uncertainty
(c.f. table II) which is within the reach of present theory [50],
[51], especially at such relatively large distances where the
material properties of the mirrors are not crucial any more.
So the experiment will be limited directly by the overall
10−4 rad) in (7) leading to the curve
uncertainty on ∆φ (
at large distances in ﬁgure 6, and an overall improvement by
about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude on present limits.

≈

The second stage requires one or several experimental
”tricks” to reduce the effect of UQED. For example, one

solid red line indicates estimated limits from the present proposal when using

could use a mirror with a narrow band reﬂectivity (around
λl), or on the contrary a transparent (especially at the main
atomic transition frequencies) source mass placed between the
mirror and the atom whose distance to the mirror (and hence
to the atom) is measured using an additional interferometer.
Both methods could at most reduce the effect of UQED
two orders of magnitude (the order of residual
by about
reﬂectivity or transparency of available materials). The more
promising approach (that could also be combined with one of
the previous two) is to carry out a differential measurement
between two isotopes of the same atom (e.g. 85,87Rb or
171,173Yb). The difference in UQED between two isotopes
is determined by the difference in polarizability, which is
expected to be of the same order as the isotope shift of
the main atomic transitions (typically around 10−6 in relative
value [57]), so a differential measurement should allow the
cancelation of UQED at about that level, consistent with the
required uncertainty for a measurement in the third well or
further. The disadvantage of such a measurement is that only
the differential effect of UY uk is observed which is a factor
0.01 (with ∆mat the isotopic mass difference)
∆mat/mat ≈
smaller than the full effect. Taking that into account, we obtain
the projected limits at very short and intermediate distances
shown in ﬁgures 5 and 6, with an improvement of about 3
orders of magnitude on best previous results.

VIII. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a novel experiment

to measure the
interaction between an atom and a macroscopic surface at short
distances based on the existing technology of optical lattice
clocks, with atoms trapped in lattice sites close to one of the
reﬂecting surfaces. Our detailed study of perturbing effects
(section V) indicates that carrying out the experiment with
present day technology should allow improvements of
2
orders of magnitude on the knowledge of the atom-surface
QED interaction (section VI) and of up to four orders of

magnitude on the limits of new short range interactions related
to gravity (section VII).

≈

The fundamental advantages of the described experiment are
the possibility to determine the atom-surface separation with
relatively good accuracy (
1 nm), and the large range over
which experimental parameters can be varied. For example,
by placing the atoms in different wells distances from 600
nm to several tens of microns can be explored, and using
different isotopes and internal states allows the study of the
dependence of UQED and UY uk on those parameters. The
distance ranges of best sensitivity (between 1 and 10 microns)
are also of interest as they correspond to the transition between
the Casimir-Polder and thermal regime in UQED (see section
VI) and to the region where several theoretical predictions of
new interactions can be found (see ﬁgure 6). We also note that
the possibility of varying many experimental ”knobs” (trap
laser intensity and wavelength, atomic density, temperature,
etc...) provides good handles to study and characterise many
of the systematic effects discussed in section V.

Of the studied atoms the most promising candidates are
fermionic isotopes of Sr and Yb because of the expected
low energy shifts due to collisions. But note that even with
performances that are up to two or three orders of magnitude
less (e.g. using Rb with a 10 to 100 fold loss in sensitivity due
to collisions), the experiment would still be of interest when
compared to previous measurements (see section VI, VII)
whilst using an experimental approach that is fundamentally
different from previous mechanical measurements, which is of
essence in experimental investigations of fundamental physics.

[55] The discrepancy between ﬁgures 5 and 6 around 1 micron can be traced
back to the differing limits derived in [53] and [56] from the same

than those in ﬁgure 6.

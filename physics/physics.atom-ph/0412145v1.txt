Abstract

A consistent quantum mechanical calculation of partial cross-sections leading to diﬀerent ﬁnal

states of antiprotonic helium atom was performed. For the four-body scattering wave function,

corresponding to the initial state, as well as for the antiprotonic helium wave function, appearing in

the ﬁnal state, adiabatic approximations was used. Calculations were carried out for a wide range

of antiprotonic helium states and incident energies of the antiproton. Obtained energy dependances

of some cross sections show a rich low energy structure.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most impressive success stories of the last decade in few-body physics is the

high precision experimental and theoretical studies of long lived states in antiprotonic helium

(for an overview see [1]). While the energy levels have been both measured and calculated

to an extreme precision, allowing even for improvement of numerical values of fundamental

physical constants, some other relevant properties of these states were studied with con-

siderably less accuracy. Among these is the formation probability of diﬀerent metastable

states, characterized by total angular momentum J and ”vibrational” quantum number v,

in the capture reaction

¯p + 4He −→ (4He+ ¯p)Jv + e−.

(1)

The existing calculations of the capture rates of slow antiprotons in He [2, 3, 4] are based

on classical or semiclassical approaches and they mainly address the reproduction of the

overall fraction (3%) of delayed annihilation events. Recent experimental results from the

ASACUSA project [5], however, yield some information on individual populations of diﬀerent

metastable states, and our aim is to perform a fully quantum mechanical calculation of the

formation probability of diﬀerent states in the capture reaction.

The exact solution of the quantum mechanical four-body problem, underlying the re-

action (1) is far beyond the scope of this work, and probably also of presently available

calculational possibilities. Still, we want to make a full quantum mechanical, though ap-

proximate, calculation of the above process. Full is meant in the sense that all degrees of

freedom are taken explicitly into account, all the wave functions we use, are true four-body

states.

Here ri are the vectors pointing from helium nucleus to the i-th electron, R is the vector

In Eq. (3) ΦHe(r1, r2) denotes the He ground state wave function, while in Eq. (4) ΦJv(ρ1, R)
is the antiprotonic helium ﬁnal state, for which we used a Born-Oppenheimer form [6, 7]:

It can be seen from Eqs. (10,11), that a given antiprotonic helium ﬁnal state (J, v) can be

formed from diﬀerent total angular momentum states, depending on the orbital momentum

l, carried away by the emitted electron.

The simplest way of approximate evaluation of Eq. (2) or (10) is to use Born approxi-

mation, replacing the exact scattering wave function Ψi

He,Ki by its asymptotic form Φi

He,Ki

from Eq. (3). In order to get an idea of the feasibility of such a ”full” (including all degrees

of freedom) calculation we evaluated the cross-sections σJv in Born approximation in a wide

range of quantum numbers (J, v). For the He the ground state wave function in this case

we used the simplest variational form

ΦHe(r1, r2) = N exp (−σ(r1 + r2))

(12)

with σ = 27/16 taken from book [8].

In spite of the known poor quality of the Born

approximation for slow collisions, due to the realistic ﬁnal state wave function, we hoped to

get some information at least about the relative population probabilities of diﬀerent ﬁnal

states. These expectations were not conﬁrmed, the Born cross-sections turned to be orders

of magnitude away from the more realistic ones. The detailed results of the Born calculation

There are two basic drawbacks of the Born approximation for slow collisions and long-

can be found in [9].

range forces:

— the antiproton ”feels” the interaction from the He atom, it approaches, therefore, its

wave function in the form of a plane wave has to be modiﬁed,

4

— the He electrons also ”feel” the approaching antiproton, the polarization of their wave

functions has to be taken into account.

for the wave function Ψi:

To meet these requirements we used an adiabatic, Born-Oppenheimer type approximation

Ψi

He,Ki ≈ Φi

He,Ki(r1, r2, R) = ΦHe(r1, r2; R) χKi(R),

(13)

where ΦHe(r1, r2; R) is the ground state wave function of the He atom in the presence of a

negative unit charge (the antiproton) at a distance R from the He nucleus:

HHe, ¯p(R) ΦHe(r1, r2; R) = ε(R) ΦHe(r1, r2; R),

In this approach the most diﬃcult task is the solution of (14), the determination of

the wave function of two interacting electrons in the ﬁeld of two ﬁxed charges. Instead of

performing a cumbersome variational calculation, as e.g. in [10], we follow an approximation

scheme proposed by Briggs, Greenland, and Solov’ev (BGS) [11], according to which the

solution of (14) can be sought in the form of two single-electron two-center wave functions:

ΦHe(r1, r2; R) ≈ ϕ(Z11,Z12)

(r1; R) ϕ(Z21,Z22)

(19)

In this construction the eﬀect of the electron-electron interaction |r1 − r2|−1 in Eq. (14) is

approximated by suitable choice of the eﬀective charges (Z11, Z12, Z21, Z22). BGS suggest

5

to ﬁx Z11 and Z12 at the the real charges of He and ¯p, while for the second electron Z21

and Z22 may be obtained from the requirement, that in the two limiting cases R → 0 and

R → ∞, the ground state energies of H + ion and He atom should be reproduced:

ε(R → 0) = Egs(H +),

ε(R → ∞) = Egs(He) .

(20)

The conditions (20) are fulﬁlled for

Z11 = 2.0,

Z12 = −1.0,

Z21 = 1.3444,

Z22 = −1.1095.

(21)

For intermediate R-s ε(R) is given by (19), which reproduces the variational result of [10]

remarkably well.

As for He wave function, the two electrons in this case are treated in a non-symmetric

way, and the wave function has to be symmetrized ”by hand”:

ΦHe(r1, r2; R) = N(R)

(r1; R) ϕ(Z21,Z22)

(r2; R) ϕ(Z21,Z22)

.

i

(22)

There is, however, a more symmetric realization of the BGS idea: starting with the plausible

requirement, that the two electrons should ”see” identical eﬀective charges: Z11 = Z21,

Z22 = Z12 we still can impose the conditions (20) for R → 0 and R → ∞, only in this case

the ε(R) will be the sum of two equal single-particle energies:

ε(R) = 2 ε(Z11,Z22)(R).

For this case we get

Z11 = 1.704,

Z22 = −0.9776.

(23)

The ε(R) in this case is very similar to the previous one, maybe a little closer to the ”quasi-

exact” variational curve. In this second case — for brevity let us call it SEC (Symmetric

Eﬀective Charge), in contrast to the NEC (Non-symmetric Eﬀective Charge) case — the

wave function is simply

ΦHe(r1, r2; R) = ϕ(Z11,Z22)(r1; R) ϕ(Z11,Z22)(r2; R) .

(24)

calculation are shown on Fig. 1.

For both choices (22) and (24) the deﬁnite total angular momentum wave function cor-

responding to (13) can be written as

χJt

(25)

since the ground state two-center functions ϕ1σ(r; R) do not carry any total angular mo-
mentum: they are eigenfunctions of ˆJ 2 = (ˆlr + ˆLR)2 with zero eigenvalue, even if they are
not eigenfunctions of ˆl2
R separately. The function χJt

(26)

To solve Eq. (26) numerically, ﬁrst, the asymptotic form of χJt

Ki(R) has to be clariﬁed.

Dropping the irrelevant constant term from (28) we see, that asymptotically it corresponds

to a Coulomb-interaction with eﬀective charge Zas = −(2 + Z12 + Z22). From the actual

values of Z12 and Z22 (21) and (23) we can conclude, that NEC corresponds to a weak

repulsion, while SEC — to an even weaker attraction. In reality, of course, there is no 1/R

term in the asymptotic He − ¯p interaction, since the He atom is neutral.

It has to be noted, that in spite of the closeness of the NEC and SEC electron energies

on Fig. 1, when we include the centrifugal term, the depth of the minima and the height

of the potential barriers diﬀer signiﬁcantly (see Fig. 2) and this fact strongly inﬂuences the

low energy capture cross sections.

According to (28) Eq. (26) has to be solved with the asymptotic condition

χJt

where FJt and GJt are the regular and irregular Coulomb wave functions, with Sommerfeld-

parameter

η =

(30)

and δJt(Ki) is the phase shift caused by the non-coulombic part of the potential. After the

numerical solution of Eq. (26) with boundary conditions (29) the matrix elements (11) and

the cross sections (10) can be calculated by numerical integration.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We start the discussion of our results by the remark, that the expression (11) for the

matrix element M Jt

J,l in our adiabatic approximation can be rewritten as

M Jt

where χJv(R) and χJt

Ki(R) are the 2+He − ¯p relative motion wave functions, introduced in
Eqs. (8) and (25), respectively, while Sl(R; Kf ) contains ”all the rest”: the three poten-

tials (9) integrated over electron wave functions and coordinates, angular variables of R

and summations over intermediate quantum numbers. This representation is useful, since it

turns out, that the basic dependence of the matrix elements on the quantum numbers and

9

incident energy is contained in the two χ functions, while Sl(R; Kf ) weakly and smoothly

depends on its arguments with a signiﬁcant decrease with increasing l — the orbital mo-

mentum of the emitted electron. For a few selected cases the three functions of Eq. (31) are

shown in Fig. 3. This feature of Sl(R; Kf ) allows the interpretation of Eq. (31) as a matrix
element of antiproton transition from the initial state χJt

Ki(R) into a ﬁnal state χJv(R) under

the action of the eﬀective potential Sl(R; Kf ).

The overall energy dependence of the NEC and SEC cross sections σJv(E) is shown in

Figs. 4, 5 for a few quantum numbers from the region of expected largest capture probability.

The main features of these curves can be summarized as follows.

Obviously, ﬁnal states with energy below the He atom ground state energy (-2.9036 a.u.)

have a positive Q value, so they can be reached for arbitrary low antiproton energy. For

example, on Figs. 4, 5 these states are: with (J = 34, v = 0, 1, 2), (J = 35, v = 0, 1), and

J = 36, v = 0. States with higher energy can be excited only above their threshold energies;

the steep rise of the cross sections above these thresholds can be clearly seen.

Another remarkable feature of certain cross sections is their rich low energy structure.

This is due to the repulsive barriers of the eﬀective potentials for Jt ≤ 39 − 40, as seen on

Fig. 2. The heights of the barriers are shown separately in Fig. 6. These barriers have a
double eﬀect: in general, they strongly suppress the penetration of χJt

Ki(R) into the interior
region, thus reducing the sub-barrier cross sections. For certain energies, however, there

are quasi-stationary states in these potentials, when the interior wave function has a large

amplitude, leading to sharp resonances in the cross sections. In order to clarify the origin

of these peaks, we looked at the energy dependence of the phase shifts δJt of Eq. (29). On

Fig. 7 we plotted the quantity dδJt(E)/dE — the so called time delay — which for isolated

resonances is very similar to the more familiar Breit-Wigner cross section curve. It can be

seen, that for all angular momenta Jt for which the potential has a barrier, there is a narrow

resonance which is correlated with a corresponding peak in the capture cross section. A

given cross section curve may contain several of these peaks, corresponding to diﬀerent Jt

and l values contributing to formation of a given ﬁnal state, according to the sum in Eq. (10).

In general, it is interesting to note, that in contrast to a common belief the sum of Eq. (10)

is not dominated by the s-electron emission (J = Jt, l = 0) term, the p-electrons practically

always, while the d-electrons sometimes contribute signiﬁcantly.

The dδJt(E)/dE plots apart from the narrow peaks corresponding to quasi-stationary

states, show another, much broader peak, in some cases superposed on the narrow one.

This one is connected with speciﬁc behavior of elastic scattering when the energy passes

through the potential maximum; it is called ”orbiting” [12].

Final states with higher J, for which the relevant eﬀective potentials have no barrier show

a simple energy dependence: a steep rise above the threshold and then an exponential decay

for higher energies. The exponential fall of the cross sections for increasing energies is due
to increasingly rapid oscillations of χJt

Ki(R) in the interior region which reduce the value of

the integral in Eq. (31).

The quantum number dependence of certain cross sections is shown in Fig. 8 for some

above-barrier energies, where such a comparison makes sense.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst fully quantum mechanical calculation of the process (1),

with all degrees of freedom taken explicitly into account. The adiabatic wave functions

used both for initial and ﬁnal states seem to be reasonably realistic. The results show,

that quantum mechanical treatment is really necessary, especially in the low-energy region,

where barrier penetration and resonance eﬀects are essential. The energy dependence of the

calculated cross sections shows, that the diﬀerent ﬁnal states (J, v) are excited with a large

probability in a relatively narrow window of the incident antiproton energy. In principle,

this property could be used for selective excitation of certain states. On the other hand, the

strong energy dependence of the cross sections prevents us from making statements about

13

FIG. 8: Cross-sections for the lowest few vibrational quantum numbers v and diﬀerent incident

antiproton energies (NEC and SEC calculations)

the experimentally observable population numbers of diﬀerent states since the initial energy

distribution of the antiprotons before the capture is unknown. Even if this distribution was

known, the observed and calculated population numbers could deviate due to collisional (or

other) de-excitation of states in the time interval between the capture and the measurement.

Nevertheless, we plan to make calculation of primary populations taking some trial energy

distributions for the antiprotons.

In the discussion of our results we deliberately did not take a stand concerning the

NEC and SEC approximations.

In general, the structure of both cross sections (energy-

and quantum number dependence) is similar, however, SEC gives considerably larger cross

sections. We personally think, that SEC is physically more realistic, but this belief should

be tested against some experiment, maybe, not in this particular reaction.

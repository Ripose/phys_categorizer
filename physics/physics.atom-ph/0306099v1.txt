How to derive and compute 1,648 diagrams

(Dated: January 4, 2014)

We present the ﬁrst calculation for many-electron atoms complete through fourth order of many-
body perturbation theory. Owing to an overwhelmingly large number of underlying diagrams, we
developed a suite of symbolic algebra tools to automate derivation and coding. We augment all-order
single-double excitation method with 1,648 omitted fourth-order diagrams and compute amplitudes
of principal transitions in Na. The resulting ab initio relativistic electric-dipole amplitudes are in an
excellent agreement with 0.05%-accurate experimental values. Analysis of previously unmanageable
classes of diagrams provides a useful guide to a design of even more accurate, yet practical many-
body methods.

Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) has proven
to be a powerful tool in physics [1] and quantum chem-
istry [2]. Although MBPT provides a systematic ap-
proach to solving many-body quantum-mechanical prob-
lem, the number and complexity of analytical expressions
and thus challenges of implementation grow rapidly with
increasing order of MBPT (see Fig.1) Indeed, because
of this complexity it has proven to be diﬃcult to go be-
yond the complete third order in calculations for many-
electron atoms (see, e.g., review [3]). At the same time,
studies of higher orders are desirable for improving ac-
curacy of ab initio atomic-structure methods. Such an
improved accuracy is required, for example, in interpre-
tation of atomic parity violation [4] and unfolding cos-
mological evolution of the ﬁne-structure constant α [5].

FIG. 1: Number of diagrams grows rapidly with the or-
der of MBPT. Here we show number of topologically distinct
Brueckner-Goldstone diagrams for transition amplitudes for
univalent atoms. We assume that calculations are carried out
in V N−1 Hartree-Fock basis to minimize the number of di-
agrams and we do not count “folded” [6] and normalization
diagrams. All-order single-double (SD) excitations method
recovers all diagrams through the third order, but misses
roughly a half of diagrams in the fourth order. These 1,576
missed diagrams and 72 related normalization diagrams are
explicitly computed in the present work.

Here we report the ﬁrst calculation of transition ampli-
tudes for alkali-metal atoms complete through the fourth

order of MBPT. We explicitly computed 1,648 topolog-
ically distinct Brueckner-Goldstone diagrams. To over-
come such an overwhelming complexity we developed a
symbolic problem-solving environment that automates
highly repetitive but error-prone derivation and coding
of many-body diagrams. Our work illuminates a crucial
role of symbolic tools in problems unsurmountable in the
traditional “pencil-and-paper” approach. Indeed, third-
order calculation [7, 8] was a major research project most
likely to have required a year to accomplish. As one pro-
gresses from the third to the present fourth order (see
Fig. 1) there is a 50-fold increase in the number of di-
agrams. Simple scaling shows that present calculations
require half a century to complete. With our tools deriva-
tion and coding take just a few minutes. Similar symbolic
tools were developed by Perger et al. [9], however their
package is so far limited to well-studied[7, 10] third order
of MBPT. In contrast, we explore a wide range of new,
previously unmanageable, classes of diagrams.

As an example of application of our symbolic technol-
ogy, we compute electric-dipole amplitudes of the princi-
pal 3p3/2 − 3s1/2 and 3p1/2 − 3s1/2 transitions in Na. We
augment all-order single-double excitations method [11]
with 1,648 diagrams so that the formalism is complete
through the fourth order ( see Fig.1 ). The results are
in excellent agreement with 0.05%-accurate experimen-
tal values [12]. Thus our computational method not only
enables exploration of a wide range of previously unman-
ageable classes of diagrams but also deﬁnes new level of
accuracy in ab initio relativistic atomic many-body cal-
culations. Atomic units |e| = ¯h = me = 4πε0 ≡ 1 are
used throughout this paper.

Method— A practitioner of atomic MBPT typically fol-
lows these steps: (i) derivation of diagrams, (ii) angular
reduction, and (iii) coding and numerical evaluation. Be-
low we highlight components of our problem-solving envi-
ronment designed to assist a theorist in these technically-
involved tasks. First we brieﬂy reiterate MBPT formal-
ism [13] for atoms with a single valence electron out-
side a closed-shell core. For these systems a convenient
point of departure is a single-particle basis generated in
frozen-core (V N −1) Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) approxi-

mation [14]. In this approximation the number of MBPT
diagrams is substantially reduced [6, 8]. The lowest-order
valence wavefunction |Ψ(0)
v i is simply a Slater determi-
nant constructed from core orbitals and proper valence
state v. The perturbation expansion is built in powers of
residual interaction VI deﬁned as a diﬀerence between the
full Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the
DHF potential. The nth-order correction to the valence
wavefunction may be expressed as

|Ψ(n)

v i = −Rv nQ VI |Ψ(n−1)

v

iolinked

,

(1)

v ihΨ(0)

where Rv is a resolvent operator modiﬁed to include so-
called “folded” diagrams [13], projection operator Q =
1 − |Ψ(0)
v |, and only linked diagrams [6] are to be
kept. From this recursion relation we may generate cor-
rections to wave functions at any given order of pertur-
bation theory. With such calculated corrections to wave-
functions of two valence states w and v, nth-order con-
tributions to matrix elements of an operator ˆZ are

Z (n)

wv =

hΨ(n−k−1)

w

|Z|Ψ(k)

v ival, conn + Z (n)

wv, norm .

(2)

n−1

Here Z (n)
wv, norm is a normalization correction arising due
to an intermediate normalization scheme employed in
derivation of Eq. (1). Subscript “val, conn” indicates
that only connected diagrams involving excitations from
valence orbitals are included in the expansion.

Equations (1) and (2) completely deﬁne a set of many-
body diagrams at any given order of MBPT. In practice
the derivations are carried out in the second quantization
and the Wick’s theorem [6] is used to simplify products
of creation and annihilation operators. Although the ap-
plication of the Wick’s theorem is straightforward, as or-
der of MBPT increases, the sheer length of expressions
and number of operations becomes quickly unmanage-
able. We developed a symbolic-algebra package written
in Mathematica [15] to carry out this task. The employed
algorithm relies on decision trees and pattern match-
ing, i.e., programming elements typical to artiﬁcial in-
telligence applications. With the developed package we
fully derived fourth-order corrections to matrix elements
of univalent systems [13].

This is one of the fourth-order terms from Ref. [13]

zbv ˜gcanrgnrcm˜gmwab
(εw − εb) (εmw − εab) (εnrw − εabc)

.

There are 524 such contributions in the fourth order [16].
Here abbreviation εxy...z stands for εx+εy+· · · εz, with εx
being single-particle DHF energies. Further, gijlk are ma-
trix elements of electron-electron interaction in the basis
of DHF orbitals. The quantities ˜gijlk are antisymmetric
combinations ˜gijlk = gijlk − gijkl. The summation is over
single-particle DHF states. Core orbitals are enumerated
by letters a, b, c and complementary excited states are la-
belled by m, n, r. Finally matrix elements of the operator
ˆZ in the DHF basis are denoted as zij.

The summations over magnetic quantum numbers are
usually carried out analytically. This “angular reduc-
tion” is the next major technically-involved step. We also
automate this task. The details are provided in Ref. [17].
Brieﬂy, the angular reduction is based on application of
the Wigner-Eckart (WE) theorem [18] to matrix elements
zij and gijkl. The WE theorem allows one to “peel oﬀ”
dependence of the matrix elements on magnetic quantum
numbers in the form of 3j-symbols and reduced matrix el-
ements. In the particular case of fourth-order terms, such
as Eq. (3), application of the WE theorem results in a
product of seven 3j-symbols. To automate simpliﬁcation
of the products of 3j-symbols we employed a symbolic
program Kentaro developed by Takada [19].

.

Here the reduced quantities hi||z||ji, XL(ijkl), and
ZL(ijkl) depend only on total angular momenta and
principal quantum numbers of single-particle orbitals.

As a result of angular reduction we generate analyti-
cal expressions suitable for coding. We also automated
the tedious coding process by developing custom parsers
based on Perl and Mathematica. These parsers translate
analytical expressions into Fortran90 code. The result-
ing code is very large - it is about 20,000 lines long and
were it be programmed manually, it would have required
several years to develop. For numerical evaluation we
employed a B-spline library[20]. All the fourth-order re-
sults were computed with a suﬃciently large basis of 25
out of 30 lowest-energy (E > mc2) spline functions for
each partial wave through h11/2.

At this point we have demonstrated feasibility of work-
ing with thousands of diagrams in atomic MBPT. Now
we apply our computational technique to high-accuracy
calculation of transition amplitudes in Na.

Fourth-order diagrams complementary to single-double
excitations method. One of the mainstays of practical ap-
plications of MBPT is an assumption of convergence of
series in powers of the perturbing interaction. Sometimes
the convergence is poor and then one sums certain classes
of diagrams to “all orders” using iterative techniques. In
fact, the most accurate many-body calculations of parity
violation in Cs by Dzuba et al. [21] and Blundell et al.
[22] are of this kind. These techniques, although sum-
ming certain classes of MBPT diagrams to all orders,
still do not account for an inﬁnite number of residual di-
agrams (see Fig. 1). In Ref. [13] we proposed to augment
a given all-order technique with some of the omitted di-
agrams so that the formalism is complete through a cer-
tain order of MBPT. As in that work, here we consider
an improvement of all-order single-double (SD) excita-
tion method employed in Ref. [22]. Here a certain level n

of excitations from lowest-order wavefunction refers to an
all-order grouping of contributions in which n core and
valence electrons are promoted to excited single-particle
orbitals. The SD method is a simpliﬁed version of the
coupled-cluster expansion truncated at single and dou-
ble excitations.

The next step in improving the SD method would be
an inclusion of triple excitations. However, considering
present state of available computational power, the com-
plete incorporation of triples seems as yet impractical for
heavy atoms. Here we investigate an alternative illus-
trated in Fig. 1 : we compute the dominant contribu-
tion of triples in a direct fourth-order MBPT for tran-
sition amplitudes. We also account for contribution of
disconnected quadruple excitations in the fourth order.
In Ref. [13], we separated these complementary diagrams
into three major categories by noting that triples and
disconnected quadruples enter the fourth order matrix
element Z (4)
wv via (i) an indirect eﬀect of triples and dis-
connected quadruples on single and double excitations
in the third-order wavefunction — we denote this class
as Z0×3; (ii) direct contribution to matrix elements la-
belled as Z1×2; (iii) correction to normalization denoted
as Znorm. Further these categories were broken into sub-
classes based on the nature of triples, so that

(cid:16)Z (4)

= Z1×2(Tv) + Z1×2(Tc)+

wv (cid:17)non−SD
Z0×3(Sv[Tv]) + Z0×3(Dv[Tv]) +
Z0×3(Sc[Tc]) + Z0×3(Dv[Tc]) +
Z1×2 (Dnl) + Z0×3 (Dnl) + Znorm(Tv) .

(4)

Here we distinguished between valence (Tv) and core (Tc)
triples and introduced a similar notation for singles (S)
and doubles (D). Notation like Sv[Tc] stands for eﬀect of
second-order core triples (Tc) on third-order valence sin-
gles Sv. Diagrams Dnl are contributions of disconnected
quadruples (non-linear contributions from double exci-
tations). The reader is referred to Ref. [13] for further
details and discussion.

FIG. 2: Representative fourth-order diagrams involving triple
and disconnected quadruple excitations.

Transition amplitudes in Na. Using our problem-
solving environment we derived the 1,648 complemen-
tary diagrams [13], carried out angular reduction [17],

3

and generated Fortran 90 code suitable for any univa-
lent system. As an example we evaluate reduced electric-
dipole matrix elements of 3s1/2 − 3p1/2,3/2 transitions in
Na (eleven electrons)[23]. Our numerical results are pre-
sented in Table I. Analyzing this table we see that leading
contributions come from valence triples Tv. Similar con-
clusion can be drawn from our preliminary calculations
for heavier Cs atom. Dominance of valence triples (Tv)
over core triples (Tc) may be explained by smaller energy
denominators for Tv terms. Representative diagrams for
these relatively large contributions are shown in Fig. 2.
Based on this observation we propose to fully incorporate
valence triples into a hierarchy of coupled-cluster equa-
tions and add a perturbative contributions of core triples.
Such an all-order scheme would be a more accurate and
yet practical extension of the present calculations.

Another point we would like to discuss is a sensitiv-
ity of our results to higher-order corrections. In Table I,
all large contributions add up coherently, possibly indi-
cating a good convergence pattern of MBPT. However,
we found large, factor of 100, cancellations of terms in-
side the Z0×3(Sv[Tv]) class.
In principle higher-order
MBPT corrections may oﬀset a balance between can-
celling terms and an all-order treatment is desired. For-
tunately, the Z0×3(Sv[Tv]) class of diagrams (combined
with parts of Z1×2(Tv)) have been taken into account in
all-order SDpT (SD + partial triples) method [22, 24].
We correct our results for the diﬀerence between all-
order [25] and our fourth-order values for these diagrams
(last row of Table I). These all-order corrections modify
our ﬁnal values of complementary diagrams by 15%.

In Table II we add our complementary diagrams to

SD matrix elements [11] and compare with experimen-
tal values. Several high-accuracy experiments have been
carried out for Na, resolving an apparent disagreement
between an earlier measurement and calculated life-
times [see review 26, and references therein]. In Table II
we compare with the results of the two most accurate
experiments[12, 27]. The SD method [11] overestimates
these experimental values by 2.5 σ and 2.8 σ respectively
(σ is experimental uncertainty). With our fourth-order
corrections taken into consideration the comparison sig-
niﬁcantly improves. The resulting ab initio matrix ele-
ments for both 3p1/2 − 3s1/2 and 3p3/2 − 3s1/2 transitions
are in an excellent agreement with 0.05%-accurate values
from Ref. [12] and diﬀer by 1.2σ from less-accurate re-
sults of Ref. [27]. Considering this agreement it would be
desirable to have experimental data accurate to 0.01%.

We demonstrated that symbolic tools can replace
multi-year detailed development eﬀorts in atomic MBPT
with an interactive work at a conceptual level, thus en-
abling an exploration of ever more sophisticated tech-
niques. As an example, we presented the ﬁrst calcula-
tions for many-electron atoms complete through fourth
order, a task otherwise requiring half a century to com-
plete. Although even at this level the computed transi-
tion amplitudes for Na indicate a record-setting ab initio
accuracy of a few 0.01%, the calculations allowed us to
gain insights into relative importance of various contri-
butions and to propose even more accurate yet practi-
cal many-body method. With an all-order generaliza-
tion [13] of the derived diagrams we plan to address
a long-standing problem [21, 22] of improving theoret-
ical accuracy of interpretation of parity violation in Cs
atom [29].

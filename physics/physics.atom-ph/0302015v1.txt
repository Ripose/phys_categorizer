We perform calculations of the dependence of nuclear magnetic moments on quark masses and
obtain limits on the variation of (mq/ΛQCD) from recent atomic clock experiments with hyperﬁne
transitions in H, Rb, Cs, Hg+ and optical transtion in Hg+.

INTRODUCTION

Interest in the temporal and spatial variation of major
constants of physics has been recently revived by astro-
nomical data which seem to suggest a variation of the
electromagnetic constant α = e2/¯hc at the 10−5 level for
the time scale 10 billion years, see [1] (a discussion of
other limits can be found in the review [2] and references
therein). However, an independent experimental conﬁr-
mation is needed.

The hypothetical uniﬁcation of all interactions implies
that variation of the electromagnetic interaction constant
α should be accompanied by the variation of masses and
the strong interaction constant. Speciﬁc predictions need
a model. For example, the grand uniﬁcation model dis-
cussed in [3] predicts that the quantum chromodynamic
(QCD) scale ΛQCD (deﬁned as the position of the Lan-
dau pole in the logarithm for the running strong coupling
constant) is modiﬁed as follows

The variation of quark and electron masses in this model
is given by

The large coeﬃcients in these expressions are generic for
grand uniﬁcation models, in which modiﬁcations come
from high energy scales: they appear because the running
strong coupling constant and Higgs constants (related to
mass) run faster than α. This means that if these models
are correct the variation of masses and strong interaction
may be easier to detect than the variation of α.

Unlike for the electroweak forces, for the strong inter-
action there is generally no direct relation between the
coupling constants and observable quantities. Since one

can measure only variation of the dimensionless quan-
tities, we want to extract from the measurements vari-
ation of the dimensionless ratio mq/ΛQCD where mq is
the quark mass (with the dependence on the normaliza-
tion point removed). A number of limits on variation
of mq/ΛQCD have been obtained recently from consid-
eration of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, quasar absorption
spectra and Oklo natural nuclear reactor which was ac-
tive about 1.8 billion years ago [4, 5, 6, 7] (see also
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]). Below we consider the limits which
follow from laboratory atomic clock comparison. Lab-
oratory limits with a time base about a year are espe-
cially sensitive to oscillatory variation of fundamental
constants. A number of relevant measurements have been
performed already and even larger number have been
started or planned. The increase in precision is very fast.
It has been pointed out by Karshenboim [13] that mea-
surements of ratio of hyperﬁne structure intervals in dif-
ferent atoms are sensitive to variation of nuclear mag-
netic moments. First rough estimates of nuclear mag-
netic moments dependence on mq/ΛQCD and limits on
time variation of this ratio have been obtained in our
paper [4]. Using H, Cs and Hg+ measurements [14, 15],
we obtained the limit on variation of mq/ΛQCD about
5 · 10−13 per year. Below we calculate the dependence of
nuclear magnetic moments on mq/ΛQCD and obtain the
limits from recent atomic clock experiments with hyper-
ﬁne transitions in H, Rb, Cs, Hg+ and optical transition
in Hg+. It is convenient to assume that the strong inter-
action scale ΛQCD does not vary, so we will speak about
variation of masses.

The hyperﬁne structure constant can be presented in

A = const × [

The factor in the ﬁrst bracket is an atomic unit of en-
ergy. The second “electromagnetic” bracket determines
the dependence on α. An approximate expression for the
relativistic correction factor (Casimir factor) for s-wave
electron is the following

Frel =

γ(4γ2 − 1)

(5)

where γ = p1 − (Zα)2, Z is the nuclear charge. Varia-

This gives an estimate for the variation of the dimension-
less ratio

the following form

tion of α leads to the following variation of Frel [14]:

δFrel

δα

K =

(Zα)2(12γ2 − 1)
γ2(4γ2 − 1)

(6)

(7)

More accurate numerical many-body calculations [16] of
the dependence of the hyperﬁne structure on α have
shown that the coeﬃcient K is slightly larger than that
given by this formula. For Cs (Z=55) K= 0.83 (in-
stead of 0.74), for Rb K=0.34 (instead of 0.29), for Hg+
K=2.28 (instead of 2.18).

The last bracket in eq. (4) contains the dimensionless
nuclear magnetic moment µ in nuclear magnetons ( the
nuclear magnetic moment M = µ e¯h
2Mpc ), electron mass
me and proton mass Mp. We may also include a small
correction due to the ﬁnite nuclear size. However, its
contribution is insigniﬁcant.

Recent experiments measured time dependence of the
ratios of hyperﬁne structure intervals of 199Hg+ and H
[14], 133Cs and 87Rb [17] and ratio of optical frequency
in Hg+ and 133Cs hyperﬁne frequency [18]. In the ratio
of two hyperﬁne structure constants for diﬀerent atoms
time dependence may appear from the ratio of the fac-
tors Frel (depending on α) and ratio of nuclear magnetic
moments (depending on mq/ΛQCD). Magnetic moments
in a single-particle approximation (one unpaired nucleon)
are:

µ = (gs + (2j − 1)gl)/2

(8)

for j = l + 1/2.

µ =

j
2(j + 1)

(−gs + (2j + 3)gl)

(9)

for j = l − 1/2. Here the orbital g-factors are gl = 1
for valence proton and gl = 0 for valence neutron. The
present values of spin g-factors gs are gp = 5.586 for
proton and gn = −3.826 for neutron. They depend on
mq/ΛQCD. The light quark masses are only about 1%
of the nucleon mass (mq = (mu + md)/2 ≈ 5 MeV).
The nucleon magnetic moment remains ﬁnite in the chiral
limit of mu = md = 0. Therefore, one may think that the
corrections to gs due to the ﬁnite quark masses are very
small. However, there is a mechanism which enhances
quark mass contribution: π-meson loop corrections to
the nucleon magnetic moments which are proportional
to π-meson mass mπ ∼ pmqΛQCD; mπ=140 MeV is not
so small.

According to calculation in Ref. [19] dependence of the
nucleon g-factors on π-meson mass mπ can be approxi-
mated by the following equation

(13)

(14)

where a= 1.37/GeV , b= 0.452/GeV2 for proton and a=
1.85/GeV , b= 0.271/GeV2 for neutron. This leads to
the following estimate:

Deviation of the single-particle values of nuclear mag-
netic moments from the measured values is about 30 %.
Therefore, we tried to reﬁne the single-particle estimates.
If we neglect spin-orbit interaction the total spin of nu-
cleons is conserved. The magnetic moment of nucleus
changes due to the spin-spin interaction because valence
proton transfers a part of its spin < sz > to core neu-
trons (transfer of spin from the valence proton to core
protons does not change the magnetic moment). In this
approximation gs = (1 − b)gp + bgn for valence proton (or
gs = (1 − b)gn + bgp for valence neutron). We can use
coeﬃcient b as a ﬁtting parameter to reproduce nuclear
magnetic moments exactly. The sign of gp and gn are
opposite, therefore a small mixing b ∼ 0.1 is enough to
eliminate the deviation of the theoretical value from the
experimental one. Note also that it follows from eqs. (11,
12) that δgp
. This produces an additional suppres-
gp
sion of the eﬀect of the mixing. This indicates that the
actual accuracy of the single-particle approximation for
the eﬀect of the spin g-factor variation may be as good
as 10 %. Note, however, that here we neglected variation
of the mixing parameter b which is hard to estimate.

Now we can estimate sensitivity of the ratio of the hy-
perﬁne transition frequencies to variation of mq/ΛQCD.
For 199Hg and hydrogen we have

g(mπ) =

Therefore, the measurement of the ratio of Hg and hy-
drogen hyperﬁne frequencies is practically insensitive to
the variation of masses and strong interaction. The re-
sult of measurement [14] may be presented as a limit on
variation of the parameter ˜α = α[mq/ΛQCD]−0.01:

Other ratios of hyperﬁne frequencies are more sensitive
to mq/ΛQCD. For 133Cs/87Rb we have

[A(Cs)/A(Rb)]

= 0.49

Therefore, the result of the measurement [17] may be
presented as a limit on variation of the parameter X =
α0.49[mq/ΛQCD]0.17:

Note that if the relation (3) is correct, variation of X
would be dominated by variation of [mq/ΛQCD]. The
relation (3) would give X ∝ α7 and limit on α variation

The optical clock transition energy E(Hg) (λ=282 nm)

Note that the atomic unit of energy (ﬁrst bracket) is can-
celed out in ratios, therefore, we should not consider its
variation. Numerical calculation of the relative variation
of E(Hg) has given [16]:

Here we have taken into account that the proton mass
Mp ∝ ΛQCD. The factor 6.0 before δα appeared from
α2Frel
in the Cs hyperﬁne constant (2+0.83) and α-
dependence of E(Hg) (3.2). Therefore, the work [18]
gives the limit on variation of the parameter U =

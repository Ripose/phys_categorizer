The spectrum of the light scattered from an extended atomic wave packet is calculated. For a
wave packet consisting of two spatially separated peaks moving on parallel trajectories, the spectrum
contains Ramsey-like fringes that are sensitive to the phase diﬀerence between the two components of
the wave packet. Using this technique, one can establish the mutual coherence of the two components
of the wave packet without recombining them.

I. INTRODUCTION

The typical operation of a matter-wave interferometer [1,2] involves a beam splitter that separates an incoming
atomic beam into a set of states having diﬀerent center-of-mass momenta, and mirrors which recombine the beams.
The atom density of the recombined beams exhibits interference fringes resulting from diﬀerent phases acquired
during free motion along the diﬀerent arms of the interferometer. In this paper, we address a question of fundamental
importance, Is it possible to establish the spatial coherence of the wave packet without recombining the beams?

To accomplish this goal, we propose a method involving Rayleigh scattering. It has already been shown [3] that the
scattered signal, integrated over frequency, is not sensitive to the spatial coherence of atom wave packets. A similar
conclusion was reached for the correlation properties of the ﬁeld emitted in spontaneous emission [4]. On the other
hand, it was shown that the spectrum of spontaneous emission was sensitive to the spatial form of the wave packet
[5]. In eﬀect, if one measures a frequency integrated spectrum, information on the momentum distribution of the
atom wave packet is lost. The scattering cross section is then a sum over contributions from each position in the
wave packet, with no interference. On the other hand, a measure of the scattered spectrum is equivalent to a measure
of the momentum of the atom and all information on the position is lost. In this way contributions from diﬀerent
spatial positions can interfere. Similar conclusions can be reached on the modiﬁcation of fringe contrast in an atom
interferometer resulting from light scattering, but the localization in that case is on the order of a wavelength [3,6,7].
It is shown below that the spectrum of radiation scattered from the atom wave packets in two arms of an interferom-
eter allows one to probe the spatial coherence between the beams. In other words, it is not necessary to recombine the
beams to observe the interference between the beams. For a two-peaked initial wave packet, the scattered signal, as a
function of the frequency diﬀerence between incident and scattered ﬁelds, exhibits a type of Ramsey fringe structure.

It is clear from Eq.

(2.2) that the spectrum is simply the momentum distribution of the entire wave packet,

evaluated at momenta determined by the resonance condition

For a double peaked wave function, the momentum distribution oscillates as a function of p, and this oscillation can
be mapped into the spectrum of the scattered radiation. For the interference term to contribute, it is necessary that
p0a
~ . 1. Let us see how this condition applies in an atom interferometer.
A well-collimated atomic beam is incident on a beam splitter that splits the beam into two momentum components.
We can imagine that a momentum diﬀerence in the x direction, p0 = 2~k, is produced via frequency controlled
Bragg scattering from two counterpropagating ﬁelds [8] or some equivalent process. The quantity k = 2π/λ is the
ﬁeld propagation constant. For the Bragg ﬁeld to split the beam into two distinct packets it is necessary that

a, and for negligible spreading of the packet, it is necessary that (~/ma) t

p0t/m = L
can be satisﬁed simultaneously only if p0a/~
1. In other words, if the Bragg ﬁeld splits the incident beam into
two, separated beams, the scattering techniques described above cannot be used to reveal the coherence of the wave
packet since the interference term vanishes! A way around this is to apply a second Bragg pulse after the beams are
separated. By a proper choice of the Bragg pulse it is possible to return the relative velocity of the split beams to
a value p0 = 0. The beams will still be spatially separated, but moving on parallel trajectories. As such, one can
analyze scattering from a two-peaked packet when the relative momentum p0 = 0.

instead of a coherent superposition of two spatially separated wave packet components, one had chosen an incoherent
sum of two separated wave packets, the interference term would be absent (corresponding to an average over φ).
Thus, in principle, one can establish the mutual spatial coherence of the spatially separated wave packet components
without recombining them.

A similar eﬀect has been predicted previously in the spectrum of spontaneous emission from an extended wave
packet. [5]. However, in order to resolve the eﬀects related to the size of the wave packet in that case, it is necessary
~/a be larger than mΓλ, where Γ is the
that the width of the atomic wave function in momentum space δp
upper state decay rate and λ is the wavelength of the transition. This requirement restricts the wave packet size to
a . (ωk/Γ) λ, which is typically much smaller (10−2 to 10−3) than an optical wavelength.

∼

∼

In our case, the size of the wave packet is limited only by the requirement that the wave packet be coherent over
a distance a. The spectral resolution needed to observe the coherence eﬀects represented in Eq. (3.2) is of order
(λ/4πa) ω2k for backward scattering when q = 2k. Using a well-collimated atomic beam or a released Bose
ωq/qa
condensate [10], one ﬁnds that a resolution of order 2π
1.0 kHz is needed. The experimental challenge is great to
say the least. The scattered signal can be detected using heterodyne techniques, but the signal strength is small,
the collection angle is small, and long integration times can be anticipated. The signal to noise can be improved if,
instead of measuring the scattered spectrum, one adds a probe ﬁeld and monitors the probe ﬁeld absorption or index
change as a function of probe-pump ﬁeld detuning.

×

It may also be possible to reduce the resolution requirements by considering scattering from a multicomponent
wave packet rather than a two-peaked wave packet. For example, if one scatters an atomic beam from a resonant
standing wave ﬁeld (resonant Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect [11]) or from a microfabricated structure having grating period d,
2 , following the interaction consists of a set of narrow peaks centered at p =n~qs,
the momentum space density,
where qs=2πˆd/d and n is an integer whose maximum value is determined by the strength of the interaction. For this
momentum distribution, one ﬁnds from Eq. (2.2) that the spectrum consists of a set of peaks (recoil components)
centered at

(3.5)

If atoms are scattered by a standing wave and q = qs, the recoil components are distanced from one another by 2ωq,
which for the D2 line in Na, is equal to 2π 208 KHz. For n > 1 the spectral width is correspondingly larger. Note
that it is still necessary to have a spectral width of order ωq/qa
(λ/4πa) ω2k to resolve the interference pattern of
Eq. (3.2); the larger resolution quoted above refers to the spectral width of the entire scattered signal.

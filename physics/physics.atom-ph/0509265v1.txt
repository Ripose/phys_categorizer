The nuclear charge radius of 11Li has been determined for the ﬁrst time by high precision laser
spectroscopy. On-line measurements at TRIUMF-ISAC yielded a 7Li − 11Li isotope shift (IS) of
25 101.23(13) MHz for the Doppler-free 2s 2S1/2 → 3s 2S1/2 transition. IS precision for all other
bound Li isotopes was also improved. Diﬀerences from calculated mass-based IS yield values for
change in charge radius along the isotope chain. The charge radius decreases monotonically from
6Li to 9Li, and then increases from 2.216(35) fm to 2.467(37) fm for 11Li. This is compared to
various models, and it is found that a combination of halo neutron correlation and intrinsic core
excitation best reproduces the experimental results.

For twenty years, halo nuclei with diﬀuse outer neu-
tron distributions have been known to exist at the limits
of stability for many of the lighter elements [1]. The
ﬁrst discovered [2] and most renowned of these is 11Li
with two halo neutrons; however, details of the nuclear
structure and halo – core interactions are still not well
understood. Nuclear forces are not strong enough to bind
a neutron to 9Li, nor can they bind two neutrons into a
dineutron. Yet adding two neutrons to 9Li leads to a
bound nucleus − 11Li (T1/2 = 8.4 ms), illustrating the
importance of understanding the interaction that allow
formation of the halo structure. Recent measurement [3]
of the rms nuclear charge radius (rc) for the two-neutron
halo 6He indicates that its halo is a dineutron ”orbiting”
the 4He core. The core is a strongly-bound α-particle
and model calculations [4] estimate only a 4% increase
in rc(α). In contrast, the 9Li-like core of 11Li is ’softer’
and interaction between halo neutrons and core nucleons
may signiﬁcantly polarize the core.

An indicator for an altered 9Li core would be a change
in proton distribution between 9Li and 11Li. This was
investigated in collisions which removed a proton from
a 11Li projectile [5], but within the rather large uncer-
tainty, there was no clear evidence for a change in the
deduced charge radius. Also, analysis and interpretation
was not straightforward because of the dependence on an
assumed nuclear model. A more sensitive approach to de-
termine the change in rc is a measurement of the isotope
shift in an atomic transition [6]. A ﬁnite nuclear charge
distribution reduces electron binding energies, particu-
larly for s-electrons that have probability of being inside
the nucleus, and a change in the distribution between
isotopes can be observed as shifts in electronic transition

energies. In light elements, the mass-based isotope shift
is much larger than the nuclear volume shift; for lithium,
about 10,000 times larger. The dominant portion of the
mass shift is change in reduced mass (normal mass shift),
but electron correlations (speciﬁc mass shift) are also im-
portant. Recent high-precision calculations account for
these correlations, as well as relativistic and QED cor-
rections [7]. In this work we present the ﬁrst measure-
ment of the 11Li isotope shift in the 2s → 3s Doppler-
free two-photon transition, as well as reﬁned values for
all other isotopes. These are compared with calculated
mass shifts, yielding nuclear charge radii that are com-
pared with various theoretical models and interpreted in
terms of halo correlation and core polarization.

The experiment must fulﬁl two conditions: measure
the isotope shift to an uncertainty of one part in 105
(10−10 of total transition frequency), and provide an
overall eﬃciency suﬃcient to observe the resonances with
production yields of ∼ 104 11Li atoms/s. Moreover, the
short half-life requires on-line study at the production fa-
cility. We previously reported a technique [8] to perform
such measurements and used it to determine the charge
radii of 8,9Li produced at the GSI-UNILAC. For the ex-
periments reported here, the apparatus was moved to the
TRIUMF-ISAC facility in Vancouver, Canada where 11Li
is produced by a 40 µA, 500 MeV proton beam imping-
ing on a tantalum target. 11Li+ ions extracted from the
target (typ. 30,000/s) are implanted in a hot carbon foil
where they are neutralized and released as atoms into
the low-ﬁeld source region of a quadrupole mass spec-
trometer (QMS). The neutral atoms are re-ionized via

lem is now solved by variational methods involving cor-
related basis sets with multiple distance scales [6]. The
resulting electron wave functions are used to calculate the
various contributions to the mass shift, listed for 7,11Li
in Table II. A recent ﬁrst calculation [7] of the mass
polarization correction to the Bethe logarithm part of
the electron self-energy has signiﬁcantly reduced uncer-
tainty in the QED contribution; overall calculation un-
certainty is now limited by the relativistic recoil term of
order α2(µ/M ).

The total in Table II is the calculated mass-based com-
ponent of the isotope shift; corresponding shifts for all
isotopes are listed in Table I. Diﬀerences from measured
isotope shifts are then attributed to the nuclear volume
eﬀect and are related to rc of the two isotopes by

with excitation taking place at the center of a doubly-
resonant optical enhancement cavity (∼100×) built
around the QMS source region. The titanium-sapphire
laser that excites the 2s → 3s two-photon transition is
beat-frequency servo-locked to an I2 hyperﬁne line stabi-
lized diode laser. As previously described [8], measure-
ments on 11Li (and the other isotopes) were interspersed
with measurements on 6Li which served as the experi-
mental reference, and measured optical powers were used
to correct for calibrated AC-Stark shifts.

Figure 1 shows a typical 11Li spectrum. Twenty-four
such spectra were obtained over six days of beam time.
With nuclear spin I = 3/2, the 2S1/2 states have F = 1, 2
hyperﬁne components, which obey the two-photon selec-
tion rule ∆F = 0 for an s → s transition. All Li isotopes
have nuclear spin and exhibit similar doublets: Isotope
shifts are taken with respect to center-of-gravities of the
two hyperﬁne lines for each isotope. Results for all iso-
topes, relative to 7Li, are given in Table I. Values for
6,8,9Li are in good agreement with our previous measure-
ments [8], but with improved precision, while the value
for the halo nucleus 11Li is a ﬁrst-time measurement.

Successful determination of changes in rc from the iso-
tope shift measurements depends critically on the com-
bined accuracy of theory and experiment. On the the-
oretical side, the quantum mechanical many-body prob-
lem must be solved to high accuracy in the nonrelativis-
tic limit, and then the eﬀects of relativity and quantum
electrodynamics are included with perturbation theory.
In the past, theoretical results with laser-spectroscopic
accuracy were not available for atoms more complicated
than helium, even in the nonrelativistic limit. This prob-

respective states [6].

Optical isotope shift measurements provide only the
change in the rms nuclear charge radius between two iso-
topes. Absolute charge radii rc must be referenced to at
least one isotope that is determined with a diﬀerent tech-
nique. For the stable 6,7Li isotopes, rc have been deter-
mined by elastic electron scattering [10], from which we
use rc(7Li) = 2.39(3) fm as a reference radius. This and
the measured 6,7Li isotope shift yields rc(6Li) = 2.52(3)
fm, in good agreement with the electron scattering result
of 2.55(4) fm [10]. Combining measured isotope shifts,
calculated mass shifts, and the 7Li reference radius yields
rc for the other isotopes, as given in the last column of
Table I.

The derived nuclear charge radii are shown as ﬁlled
circles in Fig. 2: while rc decreases continuously from
6Li to 9Li, there is a large increase from 9Li to 11Li.
The signiﬁcance of these results becomes evident when
compared with predictions from diﬀerent nuclear models,
also shown in Fig. 2. Models using point-proton radii
rpp are converted to nuclear charge radii rc by folding in
proton [11] and neutron [12] mean-square charge radii:

where the last term is the Darwin-Foldy correction for
“Zitterbewegung” of the proton [13].

Neither conventional shell model nor self-consistent
Hartree-Fock calculations have correctly reproduced
halo-speciﬁc anomalous properties of light nuclei close to
the neutron drip-line. Early models for 11Li only treated
its three-body character, without considering possible
polarization of the 9Li core [21]; thus, change in nuclear
charge radius could only be caused by correlation of the

3

two halo neutrons. If they spend most of their time on
the same side of the core, the center-of-mass (CM) is
clearly diﬀerent from the core center, the 9Li core orbits
the CM, and the averaged charge distribution is diﬀused.
Forss´en et al. [22] constructed corresponding wave func-
tions for 11Li to obtain an analytical model for electro-
magnetic dissociation of halo nuclei. The 11Li rms matter
radius of 3.55 fm was adjusted to be in good agreement
with experiment [23]; the predicted CM - core distance
RCM ranged from 0.8 fm to 1.08 fm. The approximation
c (9Li)(cid:3)
[24] rc(11Li) = (cid:2)R2
= 2.40(6) fm is in
reasonable agreement with, but slightly lower than, our
experimental result. However, information available on
the binary neutron-9Li (core) interaction is insuﬃcient
for these calculations to yield structural details on 11Li,
nor do they make predictions for changes in rc between
the non-halo nuclei.

The dynamic correlation model (DCM) is a more ad-
vanced scheme that starts from shell model states, and
then introduces neutron-core interaction with a two-body
potential [18, 25]. This leads to an admixture of virtually
excited single-particle states from the core. For 11Li, ex-
cited bound and continuum states of 9Li up to 50 MeV
were included in the analysis. Charge radii calculated
(◦ in Fig. 2) for 6,7Li agree well with our measurements,
and while those for 9,11Li are clearly overestimated, the
increase from 9Li to 11Li is correctly reﬂected.

More sophisticated nuclear models treat interactions
between individual nucleons using realistic nucleon-
nucleon (NN) and three-nucleon (NNN) interactions. NN
potentials are usually based on the multi-energy partial-
wave analysis of elastic NN scattering data produced by
the Nijmegen group [26] in 1993, while the NNN interac-
tion parameters are adjusted to ﬁt the binding energies of
light nuclei. Greens-Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) cal-
culations [4, 14], the most fundamental description avail-
able for light nuclei, have been completed for most nuclei
with mass numbers A ≤ 12. Results for the isotopes
6,7,8,9Li are shown (△) in Fig. 2 and are in good agree-
ment with the experimental results. The general trend is
reproduced, but thus far the model has not been able to
reproduce the 11Li binding energy.

No-Core Shell Model (NCSM) calculations have been
performed using realistic NN potentials. Earlier calcula-
tions [20] (⋄) for 7,8,9,11Li treated three-body interactions
as an eﬀective phenomenological potential, while recent
work [19] ((cid:3)) included microscopic three-body potentials
and was applied to 6,7Li. As seen in Fig. 2, neither the
absolute charge radii, nor the trend along the isotopic
chain are in agreement with our results.

The Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD) model [27]
uses Gaussian wave packets for individual nucleons. The
NN-interaction is derived from the Argonne V18 inter-
action, treating short-range correlations explicitly with
an unitary operator. Predictions of the model [17] (⊕)

are in good agreement with experiment for 6,7,8,9Li, but,
like GFMC, the halo structure of 11Li has not yet been
successfully modelled.

Calculations that consider interactions between all
individual nucleons quickly become very complex and
time consuming with increasing nucleon number. Clus-
ter models like the stochastic variational multi-cluster
(SVMC) calculations of Varga et al. [15, 16] freeze some
parts of the model space and allow focus on those degrees
of freedom thought to be most relevant to the physical be-
haviour of a given nucleus. To a large extent, this cluster
structure can also be identiﬁed in FMD calculations. The
building blocks in the SVMC model are the nucleons p
and n, the α-particle, and the tritium nucleus t. The nu-
clei α and t are not treated as structureless particles; their
wave functions are constructed on the nucleonic level and
only nucleon motion within the clusters is approximated
by simple shell-model conﬁgurations. The many-body
state then describes the correlated relative motion of the
diﬀerent clusters in a fully anti-symmetrized wave func-
tion that obeys the Pauli principle and thus also accounts
for correlated motion of the halo neutrons. The nucleon-
nucleon interactions are chosen to reproduce, e.g., phase
shifts in NN, αN and αα scattering, and deuteron size
and binding energy. Additional eﬀective nucleon-nucleon
interactions are included to account for three-nucleon in-
teractions. This model clearly shows the best agreement
with our experiment (▽ in Fig. 2). Calculations for 11Li
were performed both with and without possible excita-
tions of the 9Li core by the halo neutrons.
Including
these intrinsic excitations results in rc(11Li) = 2.52 fm, in
good agreement with experiment, while neglecting them
results in the much smaller value rc(11Li) = 2.28 fm (H in
Fig. 2). Thus, within the framework of SVMC, neutron
correlations alone cannot reproduce the large change in
rc between 9Li and 11Li observed in the experiment. The
calculations rather indicate that the core is indeed per-
turbed and that this perturbation accounts for most of
the charge radius increase. It will be interesting to see
whether the model is also able to describe correlations in
the momentum distributions of breakup fragments [28]
and recently improved measurements of the 11Li electro-
magnetic moments [29].

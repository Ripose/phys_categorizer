We report the ﬁrst direct excitation of the strongly forbidden 5s2 1S0 −5s5p 3P0 transition in 87Sr.
Its frequency is 429 228 004 235 (20) kHz. A resonant laser creates a small leak in a magneto-optical
trap (MOT): atoms build up to the metastable 3P0 state and escape the trapping process, leading
−3 Hz and
to a detectable decrease in the MOT ﬂuorescence. This line has a natural width of 10

free dipole trap.

In addition to being at the heart of the international
system of units, extreme frequency metrology ﬁnds a
wide range of applications throughout physics. As an
example, tests of the stability of fundamental constants
are performed by comparing the frequencies of diﬀerent
atomic transitions [1, 2]. These laboratory tests are al-
ready competitive with those performed at the cosmo-
logical scale [3, 4] and improve with the accuracy of the
atomic transitions frequency measurements. Microwave
frequency standards such as atomic fountains now have
relative accuracies better than 10−15 with potential im-
provements down to 10−16 [5]. Going further, however,
seems extremely diﬃcult due to the limited quality factor
of the atomic resonance in these devices (∼ 1010). Opti-
cal frequency standards exhibit much higher line-Q, up to
1014 as recently demonstrated in Ref. [6]. These devices
reach fractional frequency instabilities below 10−14 over 1
s [7], almost one order of magnitude better than fountains
[5]. Their current accuracy lies near 1 part in 1014 with
anticipated large room for improvement [2, 8, 9, 10, 11].
Two diﬀerent approaches are commonly used to de-
velop optical frequency standards [12]. The ﬁrst one is
based on the spectroscopy of a single trapped ion, the
second on the spectroscopy of a large ensemble of free
falling neutral atoms. It is a commonly shared opinion
that the ion approach may lead to a better ultimate fre-
quency accuracy due to the ”perfect” control of the ion
motion, while the atomic approach should lead to a bet-
ter frequency stability thanks to the numerous quantum
references contributing to the signal. Recently H. Katori
proposed a scheme which would combine the advantages
of both approaches [13]. The idea is to trap neutral atoms
in the Lamb-Dicke regime in an optical lattice operating
at a wavelength where the light-shift of the clock transi-
tion vanishes.

H. Katori proposed to use 87Sr probed on the 5s2 1S0 −
5s5p 3P0 line at 698 nm, which indeed seems an ideal sys-
tem for the realization of this scheme. This J = 0−J = 0
resonance is only slightly allowed by hyperﬁne coupling
and its metrological properties are exquisite. A natural

linewidth of ∼ 1 mHz can be derived from the hyperﬁne
data found in Ref. [14]. It has a high insensitivity to ex-
ternal electromagnetic ﬁelds. The light-shift cancellation
is expected to occur near 800 nm, a wavelength far from
any atomic resonance and for which powerful and practi-
cal laser sources are readily available. Apart from a resid-
ual eﬀect due to hyperﬁne structure, the light shift can-
cellation is independent on polarization. Finally, higher
order eﬀects due to the trapping ﬁeld are expected to be
extremely small on this particular line [15]. In this Let-
ter we report the ﬁrst direct observation and frequency
measurement of this transition.

The experiment is performed on a sample of cold atoms
collected in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). An atomic
beam is decelerated in a Zeeman slower and captured at
the crossing-point of three retro-reﬂected beams tuned 40
MHz to the red of the 1S0− 1P1(F = 9/2) transition (Fig.
1). The setup is described in details in Ref. [16]. For this
particular experiment 3 × 106 87Sr atoms are trapped at
steady state at a temperature of 2 mK. The atomic cloud
has a 1/e2 diameter of 2 mm. To probe the 698 nm line, a
14 mW laser beam passes four times through the atomic
cloud in a standing wave conﬁguration. The probe beam
waist radius is 1.3 mm. At ﬁrst sight, a direct detec-
tion of the very forbidden line with our system seems a
desperate task: the resonance is expected to be Doppler
broadened to 1.5 MHz (FWHM) more than three orders
of magnitude higher than the Rabi frequency (0.8 kHz).
Thus only 103 atoms are expected to be resonant with
the laser at a time. In addition, an eﬃcient ﬂuorescence
detection of atoms in the 3P0 state is made diﬃcult by
the absence of cycling transition from this state. Finally
the energy of the 3P0 state is known from databases to
within a few hundred MHz only.

To overcome these problems we have ﬁrst determined
the resonance frequency with an accuracy of 110 kHz by
measuring the frequency of the 1S0 − 3P1 line at 689 nm
and of the frequency diﬀerence between the 3P1− 3S1 and
3P0 − 3S1 transitions at 688 nm and 679 nm respectively
(see Fig 1) [17]. Second, to amplify the fraction of cold

atoms transferred to the 3P0 state by direct excitation,
we have taken advantage of the fact that the lifetime
of the MOT is 40 times larger than the Rabi oscillation
period. A laser tuned to resonance induces a leak in the
MOT leading to a detectable decrease of the number of
trapped atoms of 1%.

clarity, the hyperﬁne structure is not represented (I = 9/2).

The experimental set up used for all frequency mea-
surements is described in Fig. 2. An extended cavity laser
diode (ECLD1) is locked to a high ﬁnesse cavity using
the Pound-Drever-Hall method [18] with performances
reported in Ref. [19]. Its frequency is continuously mea-
sured vs a hydrogen maser with a scheme based on a self
referenced femtosecond Ti:Sapph laser [20, 21]. The rela-
tive resolution of this measurement is typically 3 × 10−13
for a one second averaging time. A second laser (ECLD2)
is oﬀset-phase locked to ECLD1. The beat-note between
both lasers is mixed with the output of a radio frequency
synthesizer to generate the oﬀset phase lock error signal.
The bandwidth of the servo control is 2 MHz. With this
scheme the light of ECLD2, which is sent to the atoms,
can be tuned to any frequency between two modes of the
cavity of free spectral range 1.5 GHz by actuating the
RF synthesizer. Two sets of lasers are used. One can be
tuned from 675 to 685 nm, the other one from 685 to 698
nm.

The frequency of the 1S0 − 3P1(F = 9/2) transition
is measured with an atomic beam independent from the
cold atom setup. The obtained frequency is 434 829 342
950 (100) kHz, with an uncertainty mainly dominated by
statistical noise and imperfect knowledge of the magnetic
ﬁeld.

The determination of the ﬁne structure splitting be-
tween 3P0 and 3P1 is performed with the cold atoms.
While trapped and cycling on the 1S0 − 1P1 transi-
tion, atoms eventually emit a spontaneous photon which
brings them to the 1D2 state (Fig. 1). This state has two

high ﬁnesse Fabry-P´erot cavity (F=27000). 100 µW are sent
to a frequency chain based on a femtosecond laser for abso-
lute frequency measurement. A second laser (ECLD2) which
is used to probe the strontium atoms is oﬀset-phase locked to

(APD) is mixed with a radio frequency reference. Noise and
frequency oﬀsets introduced by optical ﬁbers are negligible in

main decay channels: to the 3P1 and 3P2 states. Atoms
in the 3P1 state decay back to the ground state and are
kept in the trap while atoms in the metastable 3P2 state
are lost. This process limits the lifetime of the MOT to
some 50 ms. We make the ﬁne structure measurement
by modifying this escape process. If a laser resonant to
one of the hyperﬁne components of the 3P1 − 3S1 tran-
sition is added to the trap, atoms in the corresponding
3P1 state are pumped to the 3P2 and 3P0 metastable
states. They escape the trap instead of decaying back
to the ground state. This decreases the trapped atom
number. Fig. 3(a) shows the ﬂuorescence of the MOT
as a function of the 688 nm laser detuning from the
3P1, F = 9/2 − 3S1, F = 11/2 resonance.

A direct detection of the 3P0 − 3S1 transition by the
same technique is not possible because 3P0 is not popu-
lated in the MOT. Instead, a ﬁrst signal is obtained by
detecting the light shift of the 3P1 − 3S1 transition in-
duced by a 679 nm laser close to the 3P0 − 3S1 resonance.
With an intensity of 1.8 mW/mm2, a shift of 100 kHz is
observed for a detuning of 100 MHz. For a 679 nm de-
tuning smaller than the width of the 688 nm resonance,
a dip appears in the resonance proﬁle due to coherent
population trapping (CPT): when the frequency diﬀer-
ence between both lasers matches the atomic ﬁne struc-
ture, there exists a coherent superposition of 3P1 and

3P0 states which is not coupled to 3S1 [22]. Atoms in
this dark state are not pumped to 3P2 but decay back to
the ground state in a few 10 µs due to the 3P1 instability.
They are kept in the MOT. When the CPT dip is cen-
tered on the 688 nm resonance, the 679 nm laser is tuned
to resonance. The observed signal in this conﬁguration
is shown in Fig. 3(b). The ﬁne structure measurement is
performed light shift free with both lasers locked on res-
onance. We measured a frequency of 5 601 338 650 (50)
kHz with an uncertainty mainly due to the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient of the MOT. According to these measurements,
the 1S0 − 3P0 transition is expected to have a frequency
of 429 228 004 300 (110) kHz.

FIG. 3: Relative MOT ﬂuorescence signals obtained when a
688 nm laser is swept around the 3P1, F = 9/2 −3 S1, F =
11/2 transition. (a) 688 nm laser only; (b) with an additional
679 nm laser tuned to the 3P0, F = 9/2 −3 S1, F = 11/2
resonance. In this case the CPT dip is observed. Intensity of
the 688 nm and 679 nm laser are 5 µW/mm2 and 2 mW/mm2
respectively.

For the direct observation, we induce in the MOT a
leak to the 3P0 state with a laser tuned to resonance.
The lifetime of the trap is two orders of magnitude longer
than the duration of a π pulse on the forbidden transi-
tion with the laser parameters given above. This leads
to a build-up by the same factor of the fraction of atoms
escaping the MOT if the transfer rate to 3P0 is constant
and if the atoms, once in the 3P0 state, actually escape
the trapping process. One way to fulﬁl the ﬁrst condition
could consist in using the MOT to rethermalize atoms to
ﬁll the dip in the velocity distribution created by excita-
tion to 3P0. For the escape condition, one could think of
optical pumping to 3P2 with a laser tuned to 3P0 − 3S1.
In our experiment however, the Doppler eﬀect induced by
gravity is suﬃcient to fulﬁl both conditions. It amounts
to several times the Rabi frequency per millisecond with
the 45◦ angle formed by the 698 nm probe beam and ver-
tical. The dip in the velocity distribution induced by the
excitation laser is then permanently reﬁlled. On the other
hand, atoms in the 3P0 state are rapidly detuned from
the excitation laser and do not emit a stimulated pho-
ton back to the ground state. The trapped atom number

should then decrease by several %.

In practice, the experiment is operated sequentially:
by means of acousto-optic modulators we alternate a cap-
ture and cooling phase with the blue lasers and a probe
phase with the 698 nm laser. The main motivation for
this pulsed operation is to avoid any light shift of the
forbidden transition. Another reason is related to the
escape process of the 3P0 atoms.
It would be less ef-
ﬁcient with the MOT beams on due to the instability
of the 1S0 state confered by the coupling to 1P1: the
reduced lifetime of the atomic coherences due to sponta-
neous emission of blue photons would lead to an eﬀective
broadening of the 698 nm excitation much larger than
the Doppler eﬀect due to gravity. The optimization of
the time sequence results from a trade-oﬀ between the
capture eﬃciency of the MOT, the ballistic expansion of
the atomic cloud during probe phases, and the eﬃciency
of excitation to 3P0. With phases of capture of 3 ms du-
ration and probe phases of 1 ms duration, we have 1×106
atoms at steady state in the MOT and the contrast of the
resonance is 1%. In ﬁgure 4 is shown the ﬂuorescence of
the trapped atoms versus the 698 nm laser detuning from
resonance. A narrow sub-Doppler structure is expected
at the center of the resonance due to the standing wave
conﬁguration. With the present signal to noise ratio, we
are not able to detect it.

698 nm laser detuning from resonance (MHz) 

FIG. 4: Direct observation of 1S0 − 3P0 transition. The line is
broadened by the Doppler eﬀect due to the ﬁnite temperature
of the atoms to 1.4 MHz (FWHM).

We have locked the laser to the 1S0 −3 P0 resonance.
Its frequency is 429 228 004 235 kHz with a standard
deviation of 20 kHz for an averaging time of 2 hours. At
that level, the systematic eﬀects are negligible. The ﬁrst
order Doppler eﬀect vanishes due to the standing wave
conﬁguration. The Zeeman eﬀect induced by the MOT
ﬁeld gradient is less than 1 kHz, since the Land´e factors of
the 1S0 and 3P0 levels are both equal to −1.3×10−4. The
light shift which would result from imperfect extinction

of the blue light is also estimated below 1 kHz. Tab.
I summarizes the indirect and direct measurements and
conﬁrms the good agreement between both methods.

The technique used for the direct detection of this line
can be extended to other atomic species. As an example,
Yb has the same level scheme as Sr with several isotopes
having non-zero nuclear spin. With Yb atoms trapped
on the 1S0 −3 P1 transition of natural width 200 kHz, the
lifetime of the MOT can be much longer than the blue
Sr MOT, up to several seconds in Ref. [24]. The contrast
of the forbidden line would then be close to 100%.

The observation of the 1S0 − 3P0 transition is a ﬁrst
step towards the realization of an optical frequency stan-
dard using trapped neutral atoms. Clearly the next
step is the measurement of the wavelength of the dipole
trap beam where light-shift cancellation occurs. This
measurement requires better frequency resolution than
achieved here, i.e. higher laser intensity at 698 nm and/or
colder atoms.

In this new type of optical frequency standards a line-Q
as high as 1015 is achievable if the spontaneous emission
rate in the optical trap is less than one per second. With
a laser intensity of 2 × 107 W/m2, the trap oscillation
frequency can be 50 kHz and the spontaneous emission
rate 0.6 s−1. With a line-Q of 1015 and a reasonable
trapped atom number of the order of 106, ultimate per-
formances are orders of magnitude better than existing
devices. The frequency noise of the laser used to probe
the atoms will then be of decisive importance [19]. State
of the art ultra stable lasers use macroscopic resonators
as a reference and exhibit 1/f frequency noise at Fourier
frequencies below a few Hz [23]. We propose to circum-
vent this problem with a ﬁrst stage servo control to the
atomic transition with a separate setup fully optimized
for frequency stability: large number of atoms, favorable
duty cycle. . . At the price of an increase of the experi-
mental width of the atomic resonance the response time
of the servo-control can be as fast as desired. With this
additional degree of freedom, the optimization of ultra-
stable lasers should lead to a large improvement of their

4

performances. One could then approach the demanding
requirements of the optical standard using trapped neu-
tral atoms.

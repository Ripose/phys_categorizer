(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Longstanding problems in the comparison of very accurate hyperﬁne-shift measurements to the-
ory were partly overcome by precise measurements on few-electron highly-charged ions. Still the
agreement between theory and experiment is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we present a radically
new way of precisely measuring hyperﬁne shifts, and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness in the case of the
hyperﬁne shift of 4s1/2 and 4p1/2 in 207Pb53+. It is based on the precise detection of dielectronic
resonances that occur in electron-ion recombination at very low energy. This allows us to determine
the hyperﬁne constant to around 0.6 meV accuracy which is on the order of 10%.

PACS numbers: 31.30.Gs, 34.80.Lx

The hyperﬁne structure (hfs) in atoms reﬂects fun-
damental high-order eﬀects in the interaction between
the bound electrons and the nucleus. The energy shift
contains contributions from Quantum Electro-Dynamics
(QED) and from the nuclear charge and magnetic mo-
ment distribution [1]. These eﬀects have been studied
over decades by spectroscopy, mainly on neutral atoms
or singly charged ions. In such many-electron systems,
the atomic structure is complex. The theoretical pre-
dictions are further hampered by imprecise knowledge
of nuclear magnetic moments which, if measured in a
magnetic ﬁeld, is shielded due to diamagnetic eﬀects [1],
which can only be estimated and corrected for through
calculations. Only recently, experimental approaches to
measure the hyperﬁne structure of heavy highly-charged
systems were opened [2, 3, 4, 5], giving a new way
to obtain nuclear moments and to test QED in a new
regime. Measurements were done for several hydrogen-
like ions: 209Bi82+, 165Ho66+, 183,187Re74+, 203,205Tl80+,
and 207Pb81+[2, 3, 4, 5]. In all cases the theory and ex-
periment do not agree in a satisfactory way. The largest
theoretical uncertainty comes from the unknown distri-
bution of nuclear magnetic moment (Bohr-Weisskopf ef-
fect), which is complicated to predict due to nuclear po-
larization [6], but also precise knowledge of the charge
radius is crucial. On the other hand, a determination
of nuclear magnetic-moment distribution is impossible
due to uncertainties in the QED prediction. Although
the measurements with H-like ions are quite accurate
(2 × 10−4 for 207Pb [4]), it is still essential to ﬁnd al-
ternative approaches to measure hyperﬁne structure for
diﬀerent ion charges where the above mentioned eﬀects
contribute diﬀerently.

Here we demonstrate a ﬁrst measurement of the hy-
perﬁne structure in 207Pb by observing dielectronic re-
combination (DR) resonances for both 208Pb53+ (zero
nuclear spin) and 207Pb53+ (nuclear spin one-half). Us-
ing the two Pb isotopes in charge state 53+, one clearly
observes hyperﬁne eﬀects in 4s1/2 and 4p1/2 F=1 and

F=0 states. The importance of this observation is that it
provides means to easily measure the hyperﬁne interac-
tion of 207Pb53+, and other ions with a diﬀerent number
of electrons, as compared to what is currently possible.
By measuring the same nucleus with diﬀerent numbers
of electrons one can measure their inﬂuence on the mag-
netic interaction and check the theories including QED
and probably do even better by extrapolating to low elec-
tron numbers. A similar idea, combining the 1s hyperﬁne
shift in H-like and the 2s shift in Li-like ions to extract
QED contributions, was recently proposed in a theoret-
ical paper[7]. A further application of this method can
be found in the new accumulator rings for radioactive
nuclei to measure their nuclear magnetic properties by
low-energy electron scattering in the cooler[8].

The spectroscopic principle of using DR resonances is
that the valence electron is excited by the capture of a
free electron into a Rydberg state. The measured reso-
nances are near threshold, thus the Rydberg energy must
balance to a large part the excitation energy of the va-
lence electron. Higher order eﬀects in the interaction of
the Rydberg electron with the core electrons are weak
and can be estimated to excellent accuracy. The mea-
surement is checked by comparing the DR resonances
with those of 208Pb53+ where no hyperﬁne splitting ex-
ists. In the 208Pb53+ case we reached before an accuracy
that enabled us to obtain spectroscopic data for stringent
tests of many-electron QED eﬀects in advanced atomic
structure calculations[10].

Selected 207Pb or 208Pb isotopes are injected as singly
charged ions from an isotope separator, at the Manne
Siegbahn Laboratory in Stockholm,
into an electron-
beam ion source, where the highly charged Pb ions are
created. From there they are injected into the heavy-
ion storage ring CRYRING, and accelerated to several
MeV/amu. After electron cooling the ion beam for 1
s, the recombination rates as a function of relative en-
ergy between electrons and ions are measured. This is
achieved by ramping the electron energy up and down,

from the cooling condition, to a maximum energy in the
center-of-mass frame so that recombination spectra are
obtained both with the electrons being slower and faster
than the ions. Thus, we can check the space charge of
the electron beam and the longitudinal drag force ex-
erted on the ions by the electrons during detuning and
make appropriate corrections [11, 12]. These corrections
are important in order to obtain accurate energy scales
in the spectra. The energy calibration was checked thor-
oughly and found to be accurate to within 0.1 meV at
energies ≤ 0.3 eV. For these low energies one takes full
advantage of the small energy spread of the adiabatically
expanded electron beam [13] and obtains a resolution on
the order of 1 meV. From ﬁts to the resonances, we con-
ﬁrm the longitudinal and transversal temperatures of the
electron beam to be kTl = 0.1 meV and kTt = 2 meV,
respectively.

The consistency of the measurement is checked by
switching between the 207Pb53+ and 208Pb53+ beams.
Small changes in the magnet ﬁeld strengths were made
for the two isotope ions to have the same velocity (deter-
mined by electron cooling) and the same circulation fre-
quency in the ring (measured by the Schottky frequency).
We also compare the 208Pb53+ data measured in this run
with those measured earlier (with kTl = 0.08 meV and
kTt = 1 meV) and published in Ref. [10] (see Fig. 1).
Considering the small temperature diﬀerence, these data
sets agree within the statistical error(its size is seen in the
spread of the points). In Fig. 1 we also show the recom-
bination rate coeﬃcient that was obtained with 207Pb53+
stored in the ring. The diﬀerence between the two sets
of experimental spectra must then be due to the isotope
eﬀect, in particular the hyperﬁne shifts of the F = 0 and
1 states in 4s1/2 and 4p1/2 of 207Pb53+.

We have evaluated the isotope dependent contribu-
tions to Pb53+ (cid:0)4ℓ1/2(cid:1) using both Relativistic Many-
Body Perturbation Theory (RMBPT) [14] and a Multi-
Conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF)
computer pack-
age [15, 16]. We have carefully checked the agreement
between the methods. The dominating eﬀect, listed in
detail on the ﬁrst six lines of Table I, is due to the cou-
pling between the total electronic angular momentum
and the nuclear magnetic moment of the spin one half
207Pb nucleus. Most of the contribution is accounted for
already with a single-conﬁguration DF calculation using
a point nucleus, as seen on the ﬁrst line. The lead wave
function has then been evaluated in a potential from an
extended nucleus, which results in a ∼ 10 % change in
the 4s hyperﬁne structure, as seen on the second line
of Table I. We use a Fermi distribution of the nuclear
charge with thickness parameter 2.3 fm and a half den-
sity radius adjusted to produce a charge root mean square
radius (rms) of 5.4942 (0.0013) fm [17]. The wave func-
tion has also been allowed to adjust to the Breit interac-
tion between the electrons and to the Uehling potential
(responsible for the bulk of the vacuum polarization),

2

but the eﬀect on the hyperﬁne structure is very small.
All these contributions agree within the displayed digits
between the two computational methods. The polariza-
tion of the closed shell core by the valence electron give
rise to important corrections to the hyperﬁne structure.
These eﬀects can only be accounted for when spherical
symmetry is abandoned, but they are still not true corre-
lation eﬀects. We have calculated this core-polarization
using RMBPT(fourth line). The dominating part of the
core-polarization is accounted for already in second or-
der (one order in the hyperﬁne structure and one order in
the Coulomb interaction). The result change with only
a few µeV when higher order core polarization is taken
into account. Since also true correlation, calculated with
either RMBPT or MCDF, gives negligible contributions,
see Table I, it is evident that the many-body aspect of
Pb53+ does not limit the potential accuracy of the de-
termination of the hyperﬁne structure. An approximate
Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect is included, assuming the same
mean spherical radius for the magnetic moment distri-
bution as was used for the charge distribution, following
e.g. Ref. [16]. Also here the two computational methods
agree to within one unit in the last quoted digit.

An additional isotope dependent contribution origi-
nate from the slightly diﬀerent potentials produced by
nuclei with diﬀerent rms (volume shift). According to
Angeli [17] the rms of 207Pb is 0.0068 (0.0002) fm smaller
than that of 208Pb. This leads to ∼ 1.6 meV larger bind-
ing energy for the 4s state of 207Pb, corresponding to
∼ 0.2 meV /10−3 fm, as seen in Table I.

The experimental evaluations of the magnetic moment
of e.g., 207Pb have been critically evaluated in Ref.[1], in-
dicating that the true value should be within error bars of
the Atomic Beam Magnetic Resonance (ABMR) result by
Brenner µI = 0.5918 (14)µN [18] and the Nuclear Mag-
netic Resonance (NMR) result by Lutz and Stricker [19],
quoted in Ref.[1] as µI = 0.5925 (6)µN . While the optical
pumping result by Gibbs and White [9], which is ≈ 1.3%
below Ref. [18], seems to suﬀer from systematic errors.
Here we have used the value from Ref. [18].

in Pb52+, Pb53+

As in 208Pb [10] the recombination goes through
(cid:0)3d104s1/2(cid:1) + e− →
resonances
Pb52+
(cid:0)3d104p1/218ℓj(cid:1)J . The term splitting of these ex-
cited states range from a few meV for the states around
the ionization threshold, j = 21/2, of 208Pb52+[10] to
practically zero for the highest angular momenta. When
considering hyperﬁne structure we note ﬁrst that the J-
dependent term splitting and the hyperﬁne splitting of
the 4p1/2 orbital energy are of the same order of magni-
tude. The energy levels are then expected to be governed
by intermediate coupling and will not scale linearly with
the hyperﬁne shift; each level will be an individual mix
of the two hyperﬁne components of the inner electron or-
bital. The hyperﬁne interaction involving the outer 18ℓj
electron will be much smaller due to the 1/n3 scaling of
the radial matrix elements and will be neglected in the

following. Starting from the (cid:0)4p1/218ℓj(cid:1)J energy levels
in the absence of hyperﬁne interaction [10], using the as-
sumption that only terms (J) belonging to the same con-
ﬁguration will mix due to the hyperﬁne interaction, and
using the knowledge of the splitting of the 4p1/2 in the
absence of the Rydberg electron, it is straight forward to
generate the hyperﬁne perturbed resonance energies with
standard angular momentum theory. Without hyper-
ﬁne interaction each 4p1/218ℓj conﬁguration forms two
J-terms. With hyperﬁne interaction we get four energy
levels of which two mix the J-terms. The recombination
cross section can now be constructed from the energy
positions relative the initial state of Pb53+, the autoion-
ization rates and the stabilizing radiative rates to bound
states of Pb52+. The autoionization rate varies strongly
and is governed by the actual mixture just discussed. The
radiative rate is for these high angular momenta states
dominated by the probability for the 4p → 4s transition
and is thus slowly varying and nearly constant for all the
investigated resonances. The position of a resonances is
aﬀected by the positions of the hyperﬁne perturbed ex-
cited states as well as of the shifted initial state. The
ground state of Pb53+4s is with hyperﬁne interaction
split into one state with F=0 and one with F=1. The
F=1 state has higher energy, but its decay to F=0 is
very slow. The expected life time is 2.3 × 104 s [7] which
is much longer than the time from ions production to the
measurement(∼ 5s). We have thus assumed a statisti-
cal population of the two Pb53+
(cid:0)4s1/2(cid:1)F states and the
recombination cross section from the two possible initial
states have been calculated and added with statistical
weights. This cross section has subsequently been folded
with the electron beam velocity distribution mentioned
above.

The nuclear spin dependent part of the hyperﬁne en-
ergy shift is ∆EHF S = a/2[F (F +1)−I(I +1)−J(J +1)],
where a is the hyperﬁne splitting constant for a given
state, J is the electronic angular momentum, I is the nu-
clear spin, and F is the total angular momentum. Using
the fact that 3a4p ≈ a4s to within 2−3%, as shown in Ta-
ble I, we generate a synthetic spectrum derived from the
resonance parameters as described above, and test the
sensitivity with respect to small variations in a = a4p.
The theoretical shifts in Table I are approximately re-
produced by a = 4.8 meV. Fig 2 shows the spectrum
generated with the theoretical shifts as well as with a val-
ues deviating from it with around ±0.7 meV. The spec-
trum generated from the calculated shifts seems to ﬁt the
data best. Note that diﬀerent peaks in the spectrum are
rather diﬀerently aﬀected when a is changed, reﬂecting
the non-linear shift of the resonances. With a = 5.5 meV
the synthetic spectrum shows much more pronounced res-
onances and with a = 4.0 meV the dip around 0.01 eV
has nearly disappeared. We estimate from this procedure
that with the present energy spread of the electron beam
we can get an accuracy in determining a, from a ﬁt to the

3

resonances, to the order of ±0.3 meV. Here the statistical
error was taken into account. With a specially designed
electron target of lower energy spread, one could reduce
the uncertainty further. Fig 3 shows the positions of all
the resonances and the cross section before folding with
the electron temperature.

At the present stage we are also limited in our accuracy
by the uncertainty in describing the resonances. This
problem already exists in the 208Pb53+ case [10]. There
is a so far unexplained discrepancy between theory and
measured rate coeﬃcient at energies below 1 meV. That
may cause the systematic uncertainty to reach 1 meV.
Several resonances above 1 meV are well described by
the calculated series. Another, unexplained discrepancy
appears at energies larger then 0.03 eV (see Fig. 3). As
can be seen from Fig. 3 the highest energy resonances
contribute insigniﬁcantly to the cross section. The rea-
son might be that the autoionization rates approach zero
for these high angular momenta states, but even small
electromagnetic ﬁelds in the cooler could change this by
inducing a mixture with states of low angular momen-
tum. This possibility has to be investigated further, but
will not aﬀect the conclusions here since in this range one
is not very sensitive to a hyperﬁne splitting in the order
of meV.

In conclusion, the hyperﬁne splittings in 4p1/2 and
4s1/2 state of the Cu-like 207Pb isotope were measured by
a new method to an accuracy of the order 10% of the hfs
constant. Instead of the generally applied optical spec-
troscopy, the splitting was observed in dielectronic res-
onances in low-energy electron-ion recombination. This
opens new possibilities to measure this important physi-
cal quantity in a new energy range and ionization stage
for determining the diﬀerent contribution to its value.

Abstract

Numerically determined ionization rates for the ﬁeld ionization of atomic

hydrogen in a strong and fast rising short laser pulse are presented. The laser

pulse intensity reaches the so-called “barrier suppression ionization” regime

where ﬁeld ionization occurs within a few half laser cycles. Comparison of

several existing analytical theories with our numerical results shows poor

agreement. An empirical formula for the “barrier suppression ionization”-

rate reproducing the numerical results in an excellent manner is presented.

With the “table-top” laser systems, nowadays available, ﬁeld strengths much greater than

the binding ﬁeld of the outer atomic electrons can be achieved (see e.g. [1] for an overview).

In combination with the dramatic progress in decreasing the pulse duration below 10 optical

cycles [2,3] new features in the ionization dynamics are expected. In particular, ionization at

such high ﬁeld strengths occurs mainly within a few half laser cycles, i.e., on sub-femtosecond

time scale, provided that the pulse rises fast enough so that the tunneling domain is passed

quickly. Fast depletion of bound states within one half laser cycle leads to a non-isotropic

electron distribution, and there is asymmetry even along the polarization axis [4]. Therefore,

by “tailoring” the pulse shape the plasma formation process may be controlled according

to the application under consideration, e.g., harmonics generation [5] or XUV laser schemes

[6].

to determine.

Experimentally observed ion yields are usually analyzed with the help of tunneling the-

ories among these Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) [7], Keldysh [8], Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss

(KFR) [9] or Landau [10] theory are the most prominent ones. However, it is, in general, not

possible to get good agreement for several ion species without “shifting” the laser intensity

[11]. Furthermore, the exact experimental intensity distribution in the laser focus is diﬃcult

By examining the derivations of KFR-type theories it becomes obvious that they should

fail in the “barrier suppression ionization” (BSI) regime because depletion of the initial

bound state is not taken into account there. However, depletion is, of course, crucial in BSI.

An attempt to extend the ADK-theory to BSI has been undertaken [12]. A pure classical

ionization rate has been proposed recently [13].

In this paper we compare numerically determined ionization rates with those predicted

by the Landau tunneling formula [10], the Keldysh rate [8], the ADK formula [7] and its

extension to the BSI-regime [12], a classical rate derived by Posthumus et al. [13] and a

tunneling rate suggested by Mulser [14]. In our numerical studies we restrict ourselves to

the ionization of atomic hydrogen in an intense, short, linearly polarized laser pulse.

If the electric ﬁeld is cho-

sen to be directed along the z-axis, cylindrical coordinates are introduced and the Ansatz

Ψ(ρ, ϕ, z, t) = ψ(ρ, z, t) exp(imϕ) is made the TDSE assumes the following form:

This TDSE was solved on massively parallel computers using an explicit algorithm [16]. The

TDSE (3) was numerically solved ﬁrst by Kulander in 1987 [17], but for intensities below

It is well-known that equating the ground state energy level to the maximum of the

barrier formed by the Coulomb potential and the external ﬁeld leads to an underestimated

critical ﬁeld strength [18] in the case of hydrogen-like ions [19]. The correct critical electric

is the ground state energy. Thus, for atomic hydrogen Ecrit = 0.146 holds. As soon

as the electric ﬁeld reaches this value depletion of the ground state within a time interval of

the order

−1 is expected. The times tcrit where the critical ﬁeld is reached ﬁrst for each of

the 11 pulses are included in Table I as well as the number of the corresponding half cycle.

In contrast to the tunneling regime where depletion of bound states dominates, owing

to the exponential dependence of the ionization rate, only in a small region around the ﬁeld

maxima, in the BSI-regime the ionization scenario can be diﬀerent if the critical ﬁeld is

exceeded before the maximum of the present half cycle. This is the case for some of our

model pulses as can be seen in Fig. 1. From the so-called “simple man’s theory” [21] follows

that such an ionization out of phase leads to great residual electron drift energies at the end

of the laser pulse.

From the decreasing ground state populations during the pulse instantaneous ionization

rates can be determined. In Fig. 2 these instantaneous rates are plotted vs the instantaneous

ﬁeld Einst. Fortunately, the rates are not very sensitive to the laser frequency as long as

ω <

holds (for comparison some results for ω = 0.1 are also included).

|E|

Several theories provide formulas for the ionization rate as a function of the instantaneous

electric ﬁeld. We applied the following theories to atomic hydrogen: Landau tunneling [10],

the Keldysh rate [8], the ADK formula [7] and its extension to the BSI-regime [12], a classical

rate derived by Posthumus et al. [13] and Mulser’s rate [14]. The resulting curves are included

in Fig. 2. The agreement with the exact numerical results is rather poor. Apart from

Keldysh’s result the extrapolation of tunneling formulas to the BSI regime overestimates the

ionization rate. However, except for Mulser’s rate, for very high ﬁeld strengths a decreasing

rate is predicted which is clearly unphysical (note that “stabilization” needs several laser

cycles to occur). In the classical theory of Posthumus et al. [13] the inﬂuence of the external

ﬁeld on the inner-atomic motion of the electron is neglected which obviously leads to an

underestimated rate at high ﬁeld strengths. The numerical results in the region around

Einst = 0.3 can be ﬁtted by

for the ground state population, one can reproduce the exact numerical results. This is

demonstrated in Fig. 3 for ﬁve of the test pulses. Although the rough ﬁt (6) overestimates

the ionization rate for very high and very low ﬁeld strengths the agreement is quite good,

even for the under-critical pulse no. 1. For longer pulses, passing through the tunneling

region slowly, we suggest to use a “combined” formula as follows,

Thereby Ethresh has to be determined by imposing W (t) to be continuous. Wtunnel is an

appropriate tunneling rate. Note that formula (8) can be easily re-scaled to be applicable

to hydrogen-like ions as well.

We conclude that even for the simplest atom we can think of, i.e., atomic hydrogen, none

of the theories discussed in this paper predict correctly the ionization rates in short intense

laser pulses reaching the BSI regime. From the numerical results we deduce that a successful

theory has to take depletion eﬀects into account. Moreover, in classical approaches the

inﬂuence of the external ﬁeld on the electron’s inner-atomic dynamics cannot be neglected.

An empirical formula for the BSI rate of hydrogen has been proposed.

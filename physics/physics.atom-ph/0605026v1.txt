We describe ﬁrst-principles in-plane calculations of non-sequential triple ionization (NSTI) of
atoms in a linearly polarized intense laser pulse.
In a fully classically correlated description, all
three electrons respond dynamically to the nuclear attraction, the pairwise e-e repulsions and the
laser force throughout the duration of a 780nm laser pulse. Nonsequential ejection is shown to
occur in a multi-electron, possibly multi-cycle and multi-dimensional, rescattering sequence that is
coordinated by a number of sharp transverse recollimation impacts.

of structural features keyed to speciﬁc atomic targets.
The ﬁrst extension is necessary for any ﬁrst-principles
treatment of NSTI, and the second exposes the role of
weak but sharp transverse impacts that guide the rec-
olliding electron toward its NSTI end game. The third
extension opens a domain for study that is too large for
the available space here and its results will be reported
elsewhere [19]. Altogether, we believe that our results
present the ﬁrst easily interpreted and detailed view of
NSTI.

Modern high-power Ti:sapphire laser systems can now
easily generate high repetition-rate femtosecond laser
pulses with intensities greater than 1013 W/cm2 or as
high as 1020 W/cm2. In this range of intensities, atomic
and molecular binding potentials are so strongly dis-
torted that many electrons can be removed. Recently,
using such laser pulses, the production rate of almost all
charged states of Xe, up to Xe+20, have been examined
[1]. This initiative and several other recent experiments
[2] are part of a continuing eﬀort to understand how laser
energy is coupled to atomic and molecular targets.

The emergence of these new experimental eﬀorts has
made the theoretical study of multi-electron ejection from
atoms and molecules necessary. Experience from studies
on double-electron ejection [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14] supports the generally accepted recollision
picture [5], in which a leading electron is liberated from
the target by the laser ﬁeld and is driven back by the
ﬁeld to deposit the energy that it gains from the ﬁeld to
the second electron [15].

The inclusion of fully time-dependent pairwise e-e in-
teractions poses a daunting challenge for any quantum-
theoretical
investigation going beyond the single-pair
treatment by the Taylor group [16] for helium. There
is probably no realistic prospect for extending the quan-
tum mechanical treatment to the multi-pair interactions
participating in triple ionization under the relevant con-
ditions, i.e., for laser wavelengths and under highly non-
perturbative ﬁelds with femtosecond and shorter time
resolution. Thus, a diﬀerent theoretical strategy is called
for.

It has been shown for double ionization that very large
one-dimensional [17] and three-dimensional [18] classical
ensemble calculations have been in conformity with ob-
served double-ionization phenomena (also see [14] and
references therein). In this note we show that this clas-
sical approach can be substantially extended, and we re-
port the ﬁrst results of a fully dynamical treatment of
ionization of three electrons in a two-dimensional reac-
tion plane. Our extension allows (a) tracking of three
distinct electron pairs, (b) clear interpretation of trans-
verse motion for a recolliding electron, and (c) inclusion

FIG. 1: (Color Online)The so-called knee signature of non-
sequential double ionization is shown for triple ionization
along with the corresponding knee obtained earlier for the
2+ ion count. Both ion-count curves were obtained from the
fully classical model of strong-ﬁeld ionization familiar from
the literature (see [22]).

First we show in Fig. 1 that NSTI exists in the conven-
tional sense, i.e., that a “knee” is predicted for the triple-
ion count. Second, Fig. 2 shows a sequence of snapshots
running from t=0 throughout an NSTI episode, demon-
strating the nature of NSTI ejection. Third, we will show
that a time-sequenced analysis of the transverse compo-
nent of motion gives new insight into the synergy between

FIG. 2: (Color) Chronological sequence of a planar triple ionization event. The three colored balls represent electrons in a plane
that indicates their potential energies (due to laser and nuclear forces) by tipping back and forth every half laser cycle. Blue
shading indicates the lowered side. The axes show the longitudinal (x, along laser polarization) and transverse (y) locations of
the electrons in atomic units. The energy contours have a diﬀerence of 0.3 a.u., as indicated by a vertical legend on the right.
For reference, the contour line with value of -0.6 a.u. is highlighted with a white line. The horizontal arrow in each plot shows
the direction and strength of the laser force in that snapshot. The ﬁrst row shows an electron escaping to the continuum, and
the next three rows show three suscessive returns of that electron. Note that groups of time intervals are selected to capture
key interaction events and are not equally spaced.

longitudinal and transverse forces. It reveals unexpect-
edly sharp transverse impacts that are needed to create
near-axial alignment of the recolliding electron, which al-
lows it to strike the core and free the other two electrons.

Fig. 2 shows the motion of all three electrons in the re-
action plane during evolution in a laser pulse with peak
intensity of I = 8.0 × 1014W/cm2. In this sequence, one
of the bound electrons (red) ﬁrst leaves the nucleus and
returns with a transverse displacement taking it outside
the -0.6 a.u. marker. This electron then returns to the
core three times and after twice missing the bound elec-
trons it knocks both out in the third pass. This pathway
typiﬁes the rescattering scenario found among the NSTI
trajectories obtained in such a laser pulse.

Contours and shading in Fig. 2 show the combined

potential energies from laser and nuclear forces on the
individual electrons. The tipping back and forth of the
plane shows how the binding potential centered at x =
y = 0 is deformed by the laser ﬁeld. Barrier depression
by the laser allows one of the initially bound electrons
to leave the nucleus without tunneling. The departure
time corresponds to the phase of maximum ﬁeld strength
in the second half of the laser cycle because then the
maximum degree of barrier depression is suﬃcient. The
process of barrier depression at I = 8.0 × 1014W/cm2 has
little or no eﬀect on the remaining two electrons.

This is the ﬁrst view of diﬀerent NSTI stages from a
ﬁrst-principles fully dynamical and fully correlated (al-
beit classical) calculation. Theoretical exploration of
intense-ﬁeld triple ionization under experimental condi-

in the ﬁrst two returns in Fig. 2. The nuclear attraction
in Eqs. (1) and (2), of course, provides the transverse
force, and Coulomb focusing takes place, but analysis of
the recollision scenario shows that this focusing has dom-
inant features not previously demonstrated but easily ex-
plained. The laser force carries the recolliding electron
so far from the nucleus that whatever transverse motion
it has is simply continued at a constant velocity during
its longitudinal excursions. That is, the electron drifts
freely transversely except when it is very close to x = 0,
at which time the nucleus can be eﬀective, but only very
brieﬂy. Thus in Fig. 3 we see three long sequences of lin-
ear transverse drift, ﬁrst away from the nucleus and then
toward it, rather than a steady focusing. One clearly
sees that the changes in transverse drift motion occur
abruptly just at the times the recolliding electron crosses
the nucleus (x = 0).

The imprint of the longitudinal laser-driven motion can
be identiﬁed clearly in the transverse motion. Rather
than a continuous pull, the nuclear force aﬀects the elec-
tron as a series of impulses as shown in Fig. 4a. These
impulses produce step-like jumps in the transverse mo-
mentum (see Fig. 4b). In our trajectory, the ﬁrst impulse
has reversed the direction of transverse momentum so
that the electron runs towards the nucleus at a constant
transverse speed instead of moving away. The second
impulse merely raises this speed of reaching the nucleus.

FIG. 4: (Color Online) Transverse nuclear force (top) and
transverse momentum (bottom) of the rescattering electron.
The full range of the these quantities is beyond what are plot-
ted. The two sharp impulses and two step-like jumps in the
top and bottom panels respectively coincide with the ﬁrst two
return times, which are denoted by two vertical dotted lines.

FIG. 3: (Color Online) Longitudinal and transverse displace-
ment of the rescattering electron. The light (red) and dark
(blue) lines plot the longitudinal (left scale) and transverse
(right scale) displacement. The vertical dotted lines indicate
ﬁrst two return times of the rescattering electron, i.e. when
the red line crosses x=0, and divide the growth of the trans-
verse spread into three regimes. The dashed-dotted line is a
marker for the laser ﬁeld envelope. The recollision stage takes
place from rougly t=0.750c to about t=2.500c.

tions so far is very limited. Sacha and Eckhardt [20] have
calculated the momentum distribution of a triply charged
ion starting from a highly excited compound state, where
the three electrons need not be bound initially. Liu, et
al., [21] have presented the results of an energy-sharing
thermalization Ansatz following tunneling initiation. In
contrast to these two approaches, our calculation starts
with all 3 electrons bound as the calculation begins.

Details of our method have been explained before
[22, 23], but the elements are straightforward. Under
the inﬂuence of a laser pulse, the responses of each 3-e
trajectory in both the longitudinal (x) and tranverse (y)
directions are given by solutions of the nonlinear Newto-
nian ode’s:

where the subscript i is the electron label that runs from
1 to 3, and E(t) is our 20fs 780nm laser pulse, which
has a trapezoidal pulse shape with a 2-cycle turn-on, a
4-cycle plateau and a 2-cycle turn-oﬀ. About 4% of the
trajectories are found to be triply ionized at the end of
the pulse.

In addition to being driven by the laser, the recolliding
electron also undergoes transverse displacement as seen

In summary, we have used a very large ensemble of
classical trajectories for three electrons simultaneously to
examine high-intensity triple ionization, within a planar
reaction scenario. The beneﬁt of the classical approach
is that it permits trajectories to be followed determinis-
tically and displayed graphically for interpretation. Our
calculation shows that a laser driven multi-electron corre-
lation drives the triple ionization. This generates a triply
charged ion count vs.
intensity curve, which displays a
three-electron non-sequential “knee” signature as seen in
Fig. 1.

The recolliding electron scenario of Fig. 2 is shown
to lead to a 3-electron complex (last row of the ﬁgure)
just prior to the coordinated NSTI event. We suggest
that this might be interpreted as showing an attosecond-
scale “thermalization”, consistent with the very recent
prediction of Liu, et al.
[21]. A key feature, not previ-
ously available, is the detailed eﬀect of the nuclear force
as modulated by the laser, producing a series of weak
sharp impulses on the recolliding electron. The forma-
tion of these impulses is the basis for the transverse re-
collimation and for setting up the ﬁnal ionization reac-
tion itself in the intense low frequency ﬁeld, a sequence
evident in Fig. 3.

[23] We use the so called Rochester potential [22], V (r) =
Z1Z2/√r2 + α2, where Z1 and Z2 are the charges of the
nucleus and an electron, r is the distance between these
two particles and α is the screening length, which need
not be the same for the nuclear binding potential and
the e-e repulsion potential. In our calculations, values
of the nuclear screening length, a = 1.00, and the e-e
repulsion screening length, b = 0.25, are used to avoid
auto-ionization of one or more electrons in the absence
of a laser ﬁeld [19] and to give the additional beneﬁt of a
higher yield of triple-ionization events. Our three-electron
system is represented by a micro-canonical ensemble with
up to 1 million trajectories, each with a ﬁxed initial en-
ergy of -4.63 a.u. and zero total angular momentum. Each
electron however needs not have zero angular momentum.
To populate this ensemble, we use the pilot atom method
[12], which automatically provides an appropriate statis-
tical weighting of the phase space of this 3-e system that
satisﬁes our energy and angular momentum conditions.

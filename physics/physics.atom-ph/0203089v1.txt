Abstract

Ultracold collisions of polar OH molecules are considered in the presence of

an electrostatic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld exerts a strong inﬂuence on both elastic and

state-changing inelastic collision rate constants, leading to clear experimental

signatures that should help disentangle the theory of cold molecule collisions.

Based on the collision rates we discuss the prospects for evaporative cooling

of electrostatically trapped OH. We also ﬁnd that the scattering properties

at ultralow temperatures prove to be remarkably independent of the details

of the short-range interaction, owing to avoided crossings in the long-range

adiabatic potential curves. The behavior of the scattering rate constants is

qualitatively understood in terms of a novel set of long-range states of the

[OH]2 dimer.

I. INTRODUCTION

Polar molecules bring something entirely new to the ﬁeld of ultracold physics. As com-

pared to the neutral atoms that have been studied experimentally in the past, polar molecules

possess extremely strong, anisotropic interactions. It has been speculated that dipolar inter-

actions will lead to new properties in Bose-Einstein condensates [1–3] or degenerate Fermi

gases [4]. It has also been suggested that polar molecules in optical lattices may be useful in

implementing quantum logic elements [5]. On the experimental side, cold polar molecules

may be produced in several ways, including photoassociation of two distinct alkali species

[6,7], buﬀer-gas cooling [8,9], or Stark slowing [10–12].

Regardless of the method or production, collisions of molecules are of paramount impor-

tance in describing the properties of the gas. Collisions should also be interesting in their

own right, as detailed probes of intermolecular interactions. Several features of the colli-

sional dynamics of ground-state polar molecules, based on a simpliﬁed “toy” model, were

discussed in [13]. This model accounted for the interplay between dipole-dipole interactions,

an external electric ﬁeld, and states of diﬀerent parities. The dipole-dipole interaction, which

scales with intermolecular separation R as 1/R3, renders cold molecule collisions completely

diﬀerent from cold atom collisions. This is because a 1/R3 interaction is characterized by

energy-independent low energy cross sections in all partial waves, not just in s-waves [14–16].

The relatively strong, long-range interactions imply that molecules electrostatically trapped

in weak-ﬁeld-seeking states are generally susceptible to state-changing collisions that can

rapidly deplete the trapped gas. The rates are in general far larger than those of magnetic

dipolar transitions in stretched-state alkali atoms, owing largely to the relative strength of

electric, as opposed to magnetic, dipolar interactions [13].

In this paper we address ultracold polar molecule collisions in a more realistic model,

considering in detail the OH radical. This choice is motivated by the attractiveness of this

molecule for Stark slowing from a supersonic jet [12,17]. In particular, it has a 2Π ground

state with a small Λ-doublet splitting, making it easily manipulated by modest-sized electric

2

ﬁelds. A full treatment of cold collisions is somewhat hindered by the fact that the OH-OH

potential energy surface (PES) is poorly known, although it is known to be very deep and

strongly anisotropic [19,20]. It is not even known, for example, whether OH molecules may

suﬀer chemical reactions at ultralow temperatures. As a point of reference, it was recently

suggested that the reaction F+H2 →
temperatures, in spite of having a chemical barrier height of 700 K [21].

HF + H may proceed at appreciable rates at ultralow

However,

long-range dipole-dipole forces strongly dominate the scattering of OH

molecules in their weak-ﬁeld-seeking states.

In this paper we will show that this arises

from strong avoided crossings in the long-range adiabatic potential curves, which prevent

the molecules from approaching close enough to one another for exchange potentials to

become important. In this regard cooling and electrostatic trapping of OH molecules can

provide a wealth of information on the long-range OH-OH interaction. Thus it appears pos-

sible to understand a class of ultracold OH-OH collisions without detailed knowledge of the

short range PES. This strategy would be an important stepping stone toward understanding

the full problem of ultracold OH collisions. Strong-ﬁeld seekers, by contrast, will in addi-

tion experience the short-range interaction. The complete problem of exploring collisions

of ultracold polar molecules might therefore most eﬃciently proceed by a two-step analysis,

thus simplifying this very complicated problem.

Accordingly we focus in this paper on the ﬁrst step, namely, collisions of weak-ﬁeld-

seeking states. After some discussion of the relevant properties of OH molecules in Sec. II

and their interactions in Sec. III, we move on in Sec. IV to illustrate some prominent energy-

and ﬁeld-dependent features in elastic and inelastic cross sections. Mapping these features

in experiments should help in unraveling the long-range part of this puzzle. We also present

a simpliﬁed model of the long-range interaction, to help illustrate the basic physics behind

the behavior of the cross sections. It will turn out that a new class of long-range bound

states of the [OH]2 dimer play a signiﬁcant role in ultracold collisions of this molecule.

II. OH MOLECULE

The OH molecule has a fairly complicated internal structure, incorporating rotation,

parity, electronic spin, and nuclear spin degrees of freedom, which are further confounded

in the presence of an electric ﬁeld. We therefore begin by describing the structure of this

molecule and the simpliﬁcations we impose to render our model tractable.

Molecules cooled to sub-Kelvin temperatures by Stark slowing will be assumed to be in

their electronic 2Π ground state, and υ = 0 vibrational ground state. In this state OH is

an almost pure Hund’s case (a) molecule, and has a dipole moment of 1.68 D [19]. Spin-

orbit coupling involving the lone electronic spin splits the ground state into 2Π3/2 and 2Π1/2

components, of which 2Π3/2 is lower in energy and is therefore the state of greatest interest

in ultracold collisions. In our model we take into account just the lowest rotational level

of the corresponding ground state, J = 3/2. The energy of the ﬁrst rotationally excited

state with

J = 5/2, Ω = 3/2 > is about 84K higher in energy [18] and we will neglect this

|

and higher-lying states in our scattering calculations. Such states will, however, contribute

rotational Feshbach resonances in realistic collisions.

The isotopomer 16O1H that we consider here has a nuclear spin of I = 1/2, which with

a half- integer rotational quantum number deﬁnes the OH molecule as a boson. Thus we

should take into account hyperﬁne structure to ensure the proper Bose symmetry. We will

see below that the inclusion of hyperﬁne structure is also important in determining details

of collision properties. The calculations in an electric ﬁeld also require knowing the Stark

splitting for OH molecules. Thus the Hamiltonian for the OH molecule in a ﬁeld is

H OH = Hrot + Hf s + Hhf s + Hf ield

(1)

Wave functions for the spatial degrees of freedom of the molecule are constructed in the

usual way. Namely, in the zero-electric-ﬁeld limit, eigenstates of parity ε (=

In this expression µ is the molecular dipole moment,

EΩ,Ω′ are matrix elements for the ﬁne structure Hrot + Hf s which can be found in [23,24].

These values depend on the rotational constant, spin-orbit coupling constant, hyperﬁne

coupling constant, and Λ-doublet parameters of OH. All of these constants can be found

in [18].

Equation (5) shows that, strictly speaking, the only good quantum number for the OH

molecule is the projection of its angular momentum on the laboratory axis, MF . However,

for our present purposes it suﬃces to treat the quantum numbers as “almost good.” For

example, in view of the fact that OH is nearly a purely Hund’s case (a) molecule, the

coupling between Ω = 1/2 and Ω = 3/2 states is fairly weak. We account for this interaction

perturbatively, by replacing the values E3/2 and E1/2 by the eigenvalues of the 2

2 matrix

keeping all other quantum numbers constant.

Likewise, diﬀerent values of the molecular spin J are mixed in a ﬁeld, but this mixing is

small in laboratory strength ﬁelds. The total spin F and the parity are far more strongly

mixed. Accordingly, in practice we transform the molecular state to a ﬁeld-dressed basis for

performing scattering calculations:

where α(JF ε) stands for eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (1) determined numerically at

each value of the ﬁeld. We will continue to refer to molecular states by the quantum numbers

J, F , and ε, with the understanding that they are only approximately good in a ﬁeld, and

that (7) is the appropriate molecular state.

Figure 1 shows the Stark energies computed using all the ingredients described above.

In zero ﬁeld the energy levels are primarily determined by the λ-doublet splitting between

opposite parity states, whose value is ∆ = 0.056cm−1. The alternative parity states, with

ε =

1 (f states) and ε = +1 (e states) are shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), respectively.

These states are further split into hyperﬁne components with total spin F = 1 and F = 2.

The Stark shift is quadratic for ﬁelds below the critical ﬁeld

eﬀect transforms from quadratic to linear.

E0 states with diﬀerent parity are entirely mixed and the Stark

III. OH-OH INTERACTION

We will consider diatom-diatom scattering as two interacting rigid rotors in their ground

rotational states. The complete Hamiltonian for the collision process can then be written

H = T1 + T2 + H OH

1 + H OH

2 + Vs + Vµµ + Vqq + Vdisp,

(9)

6

where Ti and H OH

i

are the translational kinetic energy and internal motion of molecule

i, including the electric ﬁeld as in Eqn. (1). Vs is the short- range exchange interaction,

Vµµ + Vqq + Vdisp are the dipole- dipole, quadrupole- quadrupole and dispersion long- range

interactions respectively. Explicit expression for the dipole-dipole (

1/R3) and quadrupole-

∝

quadrupole (

1/R5) interactions are given in Ref. [26]. Matrix elements for the the dipole-

quadrupole interaction vanish for rigid rotor molecules in identical states [19], hence will not

∝

be considered here.

The anisotropic potential between two interacting rigid-rotor molecules is conveniently

recast into a standard set of angular functions [26]:

Vs + Vµµ + Vqq + Vdisp ≡

V (ωA, ωB, ω, R) =

VΛAΛ(ωA, ωB, ω),

(11)

where ωA,B = (θA,B, φA,B) are the polar angles of molecules A and B with respect to the

lab-ﬁxed quantization axis, and R = (R, ω) is the vector between the center of mass of the

molecules in the laboratory ﬁxed coordinate frame. The indices KA and KB denote the

dependence of the interaction on the orientation of the molecules about their own axes; in

what follows we will ignore this dependence, setting KA = KB = 0. For the long-range

part of the interaction this approximates the quadrupole moment of OH as cylindrically

symmetric.

The exchange potential Vs is very complicated, consisting of four singlet and four triplet

surfaces [20], and is moreover poorly characterized. The most complete treatment of this

surface to date computes the lowest-energy potential for each value of internuclear separation

R [19]. This potential ﬁnds an extremely deep minimum at R = 2.7 a.u. corresponding to

chemically bound hydrogen peroxide, and a second, shallower minimum at R = 6 a.u. due

to hydrogen bonding forces. However, in cold collisions, the scattering cross sections are

so sensitive to details of the short-range interaction that knowing the complete interaction

7

probably would not help anyway. More importantly, as we will see below, collisions of the

weak-ﬁeld-seeking states are strongly dominated by the long-range dipole-dipole interaction.

Therefore, we will use at small R simply the hydrogen-bonding part of the potential surface

(see Fig. 13 of Ref. [19]), and we will treat this part of the interaction as if it were isotropic.

Finally, we will assert that the spin states of the OH molecules are in their stretched states,

so that ordinary spin-exchange processes will not play a role in these collisions.

We express the Hamiltonian in a basis of projection of total angular momentum,

(12)

(13)

(14)

= MF1 + MF2 + Ml,

M

MFi = MJi + MIi,

where MFi, MJi, MIi are the projections of the full molecule spin, rotational motion and

nuclear spin on the laboratory axis respectively for each molecule. Ml is the projection of

the partial wave quantum number on the laboratory axis. In this basis the wave function

for two molecules is described as:

Because the target and the projectile are identical bosons, we must take into account the

In practice, before each scattering calculation we transform the Hamiltonian matrix from this

basis into the ﬁeld-dressed basis deﬁned by (7). We solve the coupled- channel equations

using a logarithmic derivative propagator method [22] to determine scattering matrices.

Using these matrices we calculate total state-to-state cross sections and rate constants.

This paper considers the scattering problem for OH molecules in an electrostatic ﬁeld for

cold and ultracold temperatures. We are interested in particular in the highest energy weak-

ﬁeld-seeking state of the ground rotational state,

The main novel feature of OH- OH scattering, as compared to atoms or nonpolar

molecules, is the presence of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction and its dependence

on the electrostatic ﬁeld. Because these interactions strongly mix diﬀerent partial waves, it

is essential that we include more than one value of l. However, in the interest of emphasizing

the basic underlying physics, we have included only the s- and d- partial waves. Sample

calculations show that higher partial waves change the results only slightly at the energies

considered.

In this case, given the initial state with MF 1 = MF 2 = 2, the only allowed

values of the total projection are

= 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Among these channels only the one with

M

= 4 contains a contribution from s-wave scattering, and so will deserve special attention

M
in what follows. In this case the total number of scattering channels for all allowed values

of

, is 208.

A. Prospects for evaporative cooling

One of the goals of the present work is to revisit the conclusions of Ref. [13] concerning

the eﬀectiveness of evaporative cooling for electrostatically trapped molecules. To this end

Figure 2 plots the elastic and state-changing inelastic rate constants versus ﬁeld strength

for two diﬀerent collision energies, 100 µK and 1µK. Here “elastic” refers to collisions that

do not change the internal state of either molecule, while “inel” denotes those collisions

in which one or both molecules are converted into any other states. These transitions are

typically exothermic, leading to trap heating. Not all these collisions produce untrapped

states, however. We ﬁnd that the main contributions to the Kinel are given by processes

in which quantum numbers F and/or MF are changed by one. In particular, the process

especially at high electric ﬁeld.

−i → |

−

|

|

−

At low ﬁeld the rates are nearly independent of ﬁeld, but begin to evolve when the ﬁeld

10

approximately exceeds the critical ﬁeld

E0 = ∆/2µ where the Stark eﬀect changes from
quadratic to linear. Above this ﬁeld the rate constants exhibit oscillations as a function of

ﬁeld. These oscillations provide an experimentally variable signature of resonant collisions,

meaning that mapping this ﬁeld dependence should help in untangling details of the long-

range OH-OH interaction. This is similar to the ability of magnetic-ﬁeld Feshbach resonances

in the alkali atoms to yield detailed scattering parameters [27,28].

Following the example of ultracold atoms, we expect that evaporative cooling can proceed

when the ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions, Kel/Kinel ≫
hardly ever the case for large ﬁeld values

>

E0, except, perhaps, at very special ﬁeld values
where Kinel is at a minimum of its oscillation. Since the losses are dominated by exothermic

E

1. Figure 2 shows that this is

processes, the ratio Kel/Kinel in the threshold scattering limit scales as the ratio ki/kf of

the incident and ﬁnal channel wave numbers, as can be seen from the Born approximation.

Thus at high electric ﬁelds, where the Stark splitting is large (hence kf is large), the ratio

may become more favorable. In our calculations this apparently happens for ﬁelds above

104 V/cm.

For ﬁelds below

1000 V/cm, a favorable ratio of Kel/Kinel is only somewhat more

E0 ≈

likely. For ﬁelds this low, however, the maximum depth of an electrostatic trap is

8mK, as

≈

given by the magnitude of the Stark shift (Fig. 1). The temperature of the trapped gas must

therefore be well below this temperature. In the example of a 100 µK gas, (Fig. 2a), the ratio

Kel/Kinel may indeed be favorable. However, if the gas is cooled further, say to 1 µK (Fig.

2b), this ratio becomes less favorable again. This is because of the Wigner threshold laws:

the exothermic rate Kinel is energy-independent at low energy, while the elastic scattering

rate plummets to zero as the square root of collision energy. Thus, in general, evaporative

cooling seems to be viable only over an extremely limited range of temperature and ﬁeld

range for the OH molecule, if at all. We therefore reiterate the message of Ref. [13], and

recommend that cold OH molecules be trapped by a far-oﬀ-resonance optical dipole trap,

in their lowest energy

At this point we emphasize an essential diﬀerence between evaporative cooling of electro-

11

statically trapped polar molecules and of magnetically trapped paramagnetic molecules. For

polar molecules the transition from weak- to strong-ﬁeld seeking states is always exothermic,

even in zero applied ﬁeld. This is because the lower member of a Λ-doublet is always strong-

ﬁeld-seeking (e.g. Fig. 1). For paramagnetic molecules, by contrast, weak- and strong-ﬁeld

seeking states can be nearly degenerate at low magnetic ﬁeld values (e.g., 17O2 as discussed

in Refs. [29,30]. In the present case, OH is also paramagnetic and hence could in principle

be magnetically trapped. For example, the low-energy states with

F MF ε

=

11, +

might

i

|

|

be suitable candidates. The inﬂuence of electric dipole interactions on evaporative cooling

of magnetically trapped OH has yet to be explored.

B. Analysis of the long-range interaction

The general behavior of the rate constants in Fig. 2 can be explained qualitatively by

simplifying our model even further, to a case that contains only the essential ingredients:

the dipole-dipole interaction, the Λ-doublet, and an electric ﬁeld [13]. Roughly speaking, the

electric ﬁeld has two eﬀects on the molecules: 1) it mixes molecular states of opposite parity,

thus creating induced dipole moments; and 2) the resulting dipole-dipole interaction strongly

couples scattering channels with diﬀerent partial waves, leading to long-range couplings

between two molecules.

As a starting point in this analysis, Figure 3 breaks down the elastic and inelastic rates

into their contributions from diﬀerent values of the total projection of angular momentum

. This is done for the rates calculated at an energy E = 100 µK, from Figure 2(a).

M
In both elastic and inelastic scattering, the rates are dominated by the contribution from

= 4, which, it will be recalled, is the only value of

that incorporates s partial waves

M
in the present model. We will accordingly consider only this case in what follows.

M

The model used to obtain the results in Figs 2 and 3 consists of 32 channels for the

block of the Hamiltonian matrix with

= 4. To simplify the analysis of this block even

further, we focus on the sub-Hamiltonian with ﬁxed quantum numbers F = MF = 2 for

M

12

each molecule. This reduces the eﬀective Hamiltonian to six channels: there are three non-

degenerate thresholds Eε1ε2 corresponding to diﬀerent possible values of the ﬁeld-dressed

parity quantum number εi =

. For each of these three thresholds there are two channels,

±

corresponding at large R to s- and d- partial waves.

Notice that the dipole-dipole interaction vanishes for s-waves, so that ˆV 00

E = 0.

Within this simpliﬁed model we will refer to the scattering channels by the parities ε1 and

ε2 of the two molecules, along with the partial wave quantum number l. Thus the incident

channel for weak-ﬁeld-seekers will be denoted

. Recall that all other

quantum numbers (J, I, Ω, F , MF ) are assumed to have ﬁxed values for each molecule.

The explicit ﬁeld-dependence in the coupling matrix (21) explains qualitatively the be-

havior of our ultracold weak-ﬁeld-seeking molecules, which have incident quantum number

ε =

. For zero electric ﬁeld (k = 0), there is no direct dipole-dipole coupling between

−

identical molecules. There is, however, an oﬀ-diagonal coupling to diﬀerent channels with

opposite parity, as can be seen in the form of the Hamiltonian (18). This interaction brings in

the dipole-dipole coupling in second order, contributing an eﬀective dispersion-like potential

for both s- and d- partial waves. For the OH molecule this eﬀective coeﬃcient is

atomic units, far larger than for the alkali atoms that are familiarly trapped. Thus, even in

zero external ﬁeld the eﬀective interaction strength of polar molecules is quite large. This

may imply the breakdown of the contact-potential approximation to describing Bose-Einstein

condensates of polar molecules, even when their dipoles are not aligned by an external

ﬁeld [1–3]. We note that the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is relatively unimportant,

becoming larger than this eﬀective dispersion interaction only when R >

For d-wave collisions, the dipole-dipole coupling is direct, but not in the limit of zero ﬁeld,

where the molecules are in parity eigenstates. At low ﬁelds (k

1, where the Stark eﬀect

is quadratic), the diagonal coupling V 22
E

k2/(1 + k2), is small. In this limit the molecules

∝

are nearly in parity eigenstates, hence do not “know” that they have dipole moments. At

larger ﬁelds this interaction grows in scale, thus “activating” the dipoles. This is why the

rate constants shown in Figs 2,3 begin to evolve at ﬁelds near

C. Large-ﬁeld oscillations and long-range states of the [OH]2 dimer

At ﬁelds larger than the critical ﬁeld

E0, the rate constants in Fig.2 exhibit oscillations
with ﬁeld. Signiﬁcantly, these occur only when the projection of total angular momentum

= 4, which is the only case in which s- and d- partial waves are mixed (Fig. 3). To

M
understand this oscillating behavior of cross sections we show in Fig. 4(a) the adiabatic

potential curves in the simpliﬁed 6-channel model (18). In the case shown the ﬁeld is

to the crossing of the attractive

the adiabatic potential shown as a heavy black line and labeled U0.

This potential curve supports bound states of the [OH]2 dimer. These bound states

are of purely long-range character, similar to the long-range states of the alkali dimers [31]

that have been used in photoassociation spectroscopy studies of ultracold collisions [32,33].

Moreover, in the case of the [OH]2 states the shape of the potential U0, hence the energies of

the bound states, are strongly subject to the strength of the applied electric ﬁeld. The curve

in Fig. 4(a) in fact possesses no bound states in zero ﬁeld, but ﬁve by the time the ﬁeld

15

reaches 104 V/cm. More realistic adiabatic potentials are of course more elaborate, as shown

in Fig. 4(b) for the more complete Hamiltonian that includes hyperﬁne levels. Nevertheless,

in this ﬁgure, too, can be seen adiabatic potential wells that will support bound states.

The signiﬁcance of these curves is twofold: the crossing is very adiabatic, implying that

coupling to lower-energy channels is weak, and that therefore the cross sections depend only

weakly on details of the short-range potentials. This we have indeed veriﬁed by altering the

short-range potential in the full calculation.

Additionally, as the ﬁeld strength grows and the potential becomes deeper, new bound

states are added to the potential, causing scattering resonances to appear. This is the

cause of the oscillations observed in the rate constants in Fig. 2. To illustrate this, we

reproduce in Fig. 5 the complete elastic scattering rate constant (solid line), along with the

same quantity as computed in the simple six-channel model (dashed line). The qualitative

behavior is nearly the same, namely, oscillations appear at ﬁelds above

E0. Moreover, the
arrows in the ﬁgure indicate the values of the ﬁeld for which a bound state of U0 coincides

with the scattering threshold. These ﬁelds correspond fairly well to the peaks, although they

are somewhat oﬀset by coupling to other channels. Nevertheless, this simple picture clearly

identiﬁes the origin of these oscillations with the existence of long-range bound states.

These resonant states are not Feshbach resonances, since there is no excitation of internal

states of the molecules; nor are they shape resonances in the usual sense, since there is no

barrier through which the wave function must tunnel. Instead, they are the direct result of

altering the interaction potential to place a bound state exactly at threshold [14]. Probing

these states through direct scattering of weak-ﬁeld-seeking states should reveal details about

the long-range OH-OH interaction, making possible a comparison of theory and experiment

without the need to fully understand the short-range [OH]2 potential energy surface.

16

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we theoretically investigated ultracold collisions of ground state polar di-

atomic molecules in an electrostatic ﬁeld, taking OH molecules as a prototype. Focusing on

weak-ﬁeld-seeking states, we have strengthened the suppositions in Ref. [13] that long-range

dipolar interactions drive inelastic scattering processes that are generally unfavorable for

evaporative cooling of this species. However, at electric ﬁelds above a characteristic value

E0, oscillations occur in both elastic and inelastic collision rates, implying that a regime may
be found where the ratio Kelastic/Kinelastic is favorable for cooling. Even though evaporative

cooling may be diﬃcult, the inelastic rates may nevertheless prove useful diagnostic tools

for cold collisions of these molecules. The Stark slowing technique provides a means of

launching a bunch of molecules toward a stationary trapped target, i.e., of making a real

scattering experiment [12,17].

For actual trapping and cooling purposes, for instance as a means of producing molecular

Bose-Einstein condensates or degenerate Fermi gases, it seems likely that the molecules must

be trapped in their strong-ﬁeld seeking states. Collisions of these species will present their

own diﬃculties, since they will depend strongly on the short-range part of the potential

energy surface. However, the scattering length for OH-OH scattering may be determined

by photoassociation spectroscopy to the long-range bound states we have described above.

This will be analogous to the determination of alkali scattering lengths [32,33], except that

microwave, rather than optical, photons will be used. The detailed properties of the long-

range [OH]2 states, and prospects for using them in this way, therefore deserve further

attention.

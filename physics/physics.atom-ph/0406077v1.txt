We model collisionless collective conversion of a degenerate Fermi gas into bosonic molecules via
a Feshbach resonance, treating the bosonic molecules as a classical ﬁeld and seeding the pairing
amplitudes with random phases. A dynamical instability of the Fermi sea against association into
molecules initiates the conversion. The model qualitatively reproduces several experimental obser-
vations [Regal et al., Nature 424, 47 (2003)]. We predict that the initial temperature of the Fermi
gas sets the limit for the eﬃciency of atom-molecule conversion.

The idea [1] that an adiabatic sweep across an atom-
molecule resonance can transform an atomic condensate
into a molecular condensate has recently been ported to
experiments on degenerate Fermi gases. By sweeping
a magnetic ﬁeld across a Feshbach resonance, at least
part of the atoms have been demonstrably converted
into molecules [2, 3]. Magnetoassociation of atoms into
molecules via a Feshbach resonance is also the key to ex-
periments in which formation of a molecular condensate
out of a degenerate Fermi gas has been observed [4].

To date, most experiments on magnetoassociation of
fermionic atoms into molecules have been done in the
collision-dominated regime. Collisions induce thermal
equilibrium, and statistical mechanics, or indeed thermo-
dynamics, seems to be the appropriate theoretical frame-
work [5] (see also Cubizolles et al. [3]). An obvious excep-
tion is the adiabatic-sweep experiments of Ref. [2] on fast
enough time scales that particle collisions are not a major
factor [6]. These experiments are the domain of the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation. Time-dependent asso-
ciation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms into a con-
densate of molecules has attracted much interest [1, 7].
Treating the condensates as classical ﬁelds, as opposed
to quantum ﬁelds, guides and simpliﬁes the analysis of
Bose systems.
In contrast, even the zero-temperature
Fermi sea of atoms presumably cannot be represented as
a classical ﬁeld, a “macroscopic wave function”. This is
the technical dilemma we set out to tackle.

Here we develop a collisionless model for magnetoas-
sociation of a two-component Fermi gas into bosonic
molecules, treating the boson ﬁeld classically. In this set-
ting atom-molecule conversion builds up from a dynam-
ical instability. We report on comparisons with experi-
ments [2], and make the testable prediction that tempera-
ture limits the conversion eﬃciency in an adiabatic sweep
of the magnetic ﬁeld across the Feshbach resonance.

In the spirit of classical ﬁeld theory, the main assump-
tion of our model is that the boson operators in the
Heisenberg equations of motion are declared to be com-
plex numbers. To facilitate the numerics, we furthermore
only keep the molecular mode with k = 0. We also as-
sume that initially the occupation numbers of the spin-up
and spin-down fermions are the same, and that the sam-
ple is rotationally invariant. The expectation values of
the relevant operators then depend only on the energy of
the state k, ~ǫ = ~2k2/2m. We scale the c-number molec-

If the fermion occupation number satisﬁes P (ǫ) > 1
2 for
some energy ~ǫ, for a suitable detuning δ the evolution
frequency has a positive imaginary part. The implication
is that a small perturbation from the stationary state
β = C(ǫ) = 0 grows exponentially.

If dissociation of an isolated molecule into two atoms is
energetically possible, it will invariably happen because
the state space for two atoms is much larger than for
a molecule. On the other hand, a ﬁlled Fermi sea of
atoms may block dissociation. The state space of allowed
molecular states is then the one that is larger, and the
atoms are prone to spontaneous magnetoassociation into
molecules. This is the nature of the instability.

The Fermi sea is thermodynamically unstable against
formation of Cooper pairs [8], and resonance superﬂu-
ids [9] inherit an analog of this trait of BCS supercon-
ductors. Nonetheless, suggestive as the similarity may
be, the BCS instability is diﬀerent from the present one.
Thermodynamical instability occurs because pairing low-
ers the energy, and so coupling to a reservoir with a low
enough temperature leads to pairing. The hallmark of
dynamical instability is that a small perturbation grows
exponentially in time, environment or no environment.

Quantum ﬂuctuations could trigger spontaneous mag-
netoassociation, but they are absent in our model. While
much is known about modeling of quantum ﬂuctua-
tions classically in boson system [10], no correspond-
ing general methods exist for fermions. We resort to
the following heuristic device.
Instead of starting out
a calculation with zero anomalous amplitudes, we ini-
tially seed them with random numbers having zero aver-
age; speciﬁcally, nonzero numbers with a random phase,
1/2. We then inte-

approximation lies in using it at all times. As a technical
detail, in our numerical calculations we discretize P (ǫ)
and C(ǫ) at equidistant points of ǫ separated by ∆ǫ, and
resort to the analogous process.

Next we estimate the parameters of the model. First,
atom-molecule conversion is unlikely to be the result of
a contact interaction. Given a nonzero range, there is a
cutoﬀ in momentum/energy for the matrix element κkk′.
We crudely assume that the coupling between atoms and
molecules follows the Wigner threshold law up to the
point when it abruptly cuts oﬀ at some energy ~M , and
correspondingly set f (ǫ) = θ(M
ǫ). Second, we write
the dependence of the detuning on the magnetic ﬁeld
B′0)/~, where B′0 is a tentative posi-
as δ = ∆µ(B
tion of the Feshbach resonance and ∆µ stands for the
thus far unknown diﬀerence of the magnetic moment be-
tween a molecule and two atoms. Third, we have an
atom-molecule coupling strength with the dimension of
frequency, Ξ, deﬁned by Ω = Ξ1/4~3/4√ρ/m3/4.
We ignore the Fermi statistics by setting P (ǫ)

0 in
Eqs. (2-4). This yields a linear description of the cou-
pling between molecules and atom pairs. With ∆µ > 0
and for detunings less than a threshold value δ0, the re-
maining set of equations has a stationary solution; the
Fourier transforms β(ω) and C(ǫ, ω) have a real pole at
a frequency ω(δ) such that ω(δ0) = 0 and ω(δ) < 0 for
Ω were a
δ < δ0. What in the absence of the coupling
“bare” molecule and a pair of atoms become a “dressed”
molecule. We interpret ~ω[δ(B)] as the energy of the
bound state of the dressed molecule for the given mag-
netic ﬁeld, and shift the value of the resonance ﬁeld from
B′0 to B0 so that δ0 = 0. The “renormalized” B0 should
equal the position of the Feshbach resonance in the limit
of a dilute gas.

The simulations use the known experimental parameters and
parameter values ﬁtted as in Fig. 1.

Finally, we ﬁt the unknown parameters M , ∆µ, and
Ξ to best reproduce the experimental binding energy of
the molecule reported in Fig. 5 of Ref. [2]. The ﬁt min-
imizes the relative error between the calculated and the
measured values. The parameters are M = 2π
100 kHz,
∆µ = 0.19 µB, and Ξ = 2π

580 MHz.

×

By setting P (ǫ) = 0 we have ignored the many-body
shift of the Feshbach resonance. We could include the
shift by allowing P (ǫ)
= 0. For our ﬁtted parameters,
experimental densities, and untouched zero-temperature
Fermi sea, the shift could exceed one Gauss toward the
direction of high B. The preparation of the sample in
the experiments [2] quoted in our Fig. 1 alters P (ǫ) and
modiﬁes the shift in a manner that is diﬃcult to account
for self-consistently. Nonetheless, if we insert a full one-
Gauss shift by hand and ﬁt again, the most relevant pa-
rameter Ω increases by just 60 %. Including or excluding
the many-body shift of the Feshbach resonance should
not make a qualitative diﬀerence in the values of the ﬁt-
ted parameters.

Armed with the parameter values, we next simulate a
sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld across the Feshbach resonance
as in Fig. 1(a) of Ref. [2] by integrating Eqs. (2-4). From

we have ǫF = 9.2
2π kHz. The initial atomic occupation
numbers P (ǫ) are set according to the experimental tem-
perature, kBT /~ǫF = 0.21. The discretization step for
the atomic occupation numbers and anomalous ampli-
tudes is ∆ǫ = ǫF /100. We run the magnetic ﬁeld sweep
64 times for diﬀerent random phases of the anomalous
amplitudes, and average the results. Figure 2 shows both
the measured atom numbers (ﬁlled circles) and our cal-
culations (solid line) as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld
when it is swept at the rate (40 µs/G)−

FIG. 3: Fraction of atoms converted into molecules in a
sweeps such as in Fig. 2, except that here the sweep rate is
slower, (400 µs/G)−1, and the results are plotted as a function
of the varying initial temperature of the atomic gas.

Experimentally, half of the atoms are converted into
1, while our calculations give a
molecules at (40 µs/G)−
30 % conversion. There are a number of reasons why
a full quantitative agreement cannot be expected, e.g.,
keeping only one molecular mode, using the maximum
density of the atoms instead of making an allowance for
the density distribution in the trap, simplistic modeling
of the energy dependence of the atom-molecule coupling
f (ǫ), and ignoring many-body shifts while ﬁtting the pa-
rameters. Nonetheless, our model seems to identify the
correct physics parameters, ﬁrst and foremost the Rabi-
like frequency Ω, and gives a reasonable estimate for their
values.

In the experiments [2] the magnetic ﬁeld was also swept
back and forth, whereupon the molecules all dissociate
back into atoms. With the random initial phases of the
anomalous amplitudes it is not obvious that our simula-
tions should reproduce this feat, but they do.

The puzzling feature of the experiments [2] is that,
no matter how slow the sweep rate, the conversion eﬃ-
ciency is limited to about 50%. To investigate, we carry
out magnetic ﬁeld sweeps as in Fig. 2, except that the
sweep rate is such that the detuning as a function of
ξΩ2t with ξ = 0.05, corresponding
time behaves as δ =
to ˙B = (400 µs/G)−
1 determines the time scale,
for ξ = 0.05 one would expect adiabaticity. We vary the
temperature, and plot the ﬁnal conversion eﬃciency as
a function of the temperature. The results are shown in
Fig. 3. At T = 0, 98% of the atoms are converted into
molecules. However, by the time the temperature has
reached the Fermi temperature, kBT = ~ǫF , the conver-
sion eﬃciency has dropped to 2%. At the typical ex-
perimental temperatures with kBT /~ǫF ∼
0.3, the
eﬃciency in fact hovers in the neighborhood of 50%.

For an increasing temperature, a decreasing number of
the initial atomic states have a thermal occupation num-

6
ber of at least 1
2 . The instability responsible for initiating
atom-molecule conversion then acts on fewer and fewer
atomic modes. We presume this is the reason for the
temperature dependence.

The weakest point in our argument may be the as-
sumption of a single molecular mode, according to which
the molecules emerge as a condensate. It would appear
that, without any seed for the molecular condensate or
initial phase from the atoms, the atoms are converted
into a coherent molecular condensate in a time that is
independent of the size of the sample. This can hardly
be correct. Inclusion of a multitude of molecular modes
would probably cure this shortcoming. By construc-
tion we would still have a classical ﬁeld representing the
molecules, but it could consist of patches with uncorre-
lated phases. A numerical modeling of this situation is in
principle possible, but much more demanding than our
present calculations. So far we have made little progress
in this direction.

Instead, we present an estimate for the size of the
patches. The natural velocity parameter in this problem

of size ℓ

time from Fig. 2, say, as the diﬀerence between the times
when the number of molecules rises from 1

ﬁnal value in the dashed-line data, then the size of the
patch and the characteristic distance between the atoms

atoms. Within each patch we could still resort to the sin-
gle mode-approximation and use the Bose-enhanced cou-
pling strength Ω that depends on density but not directly
on the number of atoms. However, the patchy molecu-
lar condensate would not appear as a condensate in an
experiment, but would display a momentum distribution
not narrower than

∼

The number of atoms in a zero-temperature Fermi sea
is the same as the number of occupied states, so for con-
sistency we should use a step of the order of ∆ǫ
ǫF /10
in our modeling. We have used ∆ǫ = ǫF /100 in Figs. 2
and 3. Now, constants of the order of unity are beyond
our dimensional-analysis argument, and the step size es-
timate should be taken with a grain of salt. On the other
hand, numerically, the step size dependence is logarith-
mic and weak. Simulations with just one molecular mode
should therefore be valid semiquantitatively.

Starting from a microscopic many-particle theory, we

generate Fermi gas into bosonic molecules via a Feshbach
resonance. The key techniques are to treat the molecules
as a classical ﬁeld, and to seed pairing amplitudes with
random phases. The main concept we have unearthed is
dynamical instability of a Fermi sea against magnetoasso-
ciation into molecules. The same instability should occur
in photoassociation. Our model reproduces qualitatively
all experimental observations [2] where we have tried a
comparison. Moreover, we have the testable prediction
that temperature sets the limit for the eﬃciency of atom-
molecule conversion.

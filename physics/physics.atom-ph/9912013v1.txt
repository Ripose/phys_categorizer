We consider inelastic collisions between atoms of diﬀerent kinds as a
potential source of photons in the sonoluminescence phenomena. We esti-
mate the total energy emitted in one ﬂash and the shape of the spectrum
and ﬁnd a rough agreement between the results of our calculation and
the experimental data. We conclude that the atomic collisions might be
a candidate for the light-emitting mechanism for sonoluminescence and
discuss the implications.

PACS numbers: 34.50.-s, 32.80.Cy, 78.60.Mq

The sonoluminescence is a mechanism of the conversion of sound energy into the
energy of light emitted in a picosecond ﬂash. This phenomenon was discovered a long
time ago (the emission of light from the water was observed in [1]) but only recently has
attracted much attention because it becomes possible to trap a single bubble of a gas
mixture in a sound ﬁeld [2] (this is so called Single Bubble Sonoluminescence — SBSL
or just SL). The detailed review of the topic can be found in [3]. The mechanism of
sonoluminescence has not been deﬁnitely understood so far. There are several possible
explanations, each of them possessing its own diﬃculties. Let us brieﬂy review some
of the models.

One of the most promising mechanism is the Bremsstrahlung radiation from ionised
regions [4,5]. These regions are created by shock waves formed during the collapse of the
bubble. This model succeeds, in particular, in prediction of the total radiation of energy
per ﬂash. However, the presence of the plasma would imply the sensitivity of this light-
emitting mechanism to the external magnetic ﬁeld [6], which is not observed. Another
possible explanation is given by the model of blackbody radiation [7]. The spectrum
of the SL is well ﬁtted by the blackbody radiation spectrum of temperature 25000 K
(in water of temperature 22oC [8]). However, the time dependence of SL spectrum is
independent of the color of the emitted light, which contradicts the blackbody radiation
model expectations [9]. Other models refer to purely quantum eﬀects. These are: the
“dynamical Casimir eﬀect” suggested by Schwinger [10] and the Unruh eﬀect elaborated
in more details by Eberlein [11]. Unfortunately, the dynamical Casimir eﬀect gives
ambiguous predictions depending on the renormalization procedure that one chooses,
while the Unruh eﬀect gives the power of radiation too low by some orders of magnitude.

1

Yet another model describes the SL radiation as a radiation emitted from molecular
collisions [12]. This model properly predicts the shape of the spectrum, however it tends
to overestimate the magnitude of the emitted energy if one uses the realistic values of
the radiating volume and the emission time. Besides, recent developments suggest that
due to sonochemical reactions mainly noble gases are left inside the bubble [13], which
if true, may be troublesome for the mechanism of SL. Since none of the mechanisms is
fully satisfactory we may, in search for an alternative candidate, address the question
if the inelastic collisions between atoms may be the source of light in sonoluminescence.

Thus we consider in this article the exclusive reaction A1 + A2

A1 + A2 + γ
of photon production in which the atoms remain in their ground state. There are
interesting features concerning these reactions which encourage to study them in more
detail:
(i) The featureless spectrum of SL suggests that the emission of light from excited
atoms do not play a crucial role in the phenomenon.
(ii) The spectrum of photons emitted in atomic collisions can behave similarly to that
of SL. Indeed, the emission of photons with a wavelength greater than the size of the
atom is suppressed due to the mutual cancellations between the contributions of the
nucleus and the electronic cloud (c.f.
the Rayleigh scattering process). The short
wavelength photons are absent because of the cut-oﬀ on the energy available in the
collision.

In the case of SL from an air bubble in water the analysis of the scattering of
the oxygen or nitrogen atoms on the atoms of argon should be performed. The exact
calculation for this process is extremely involved thus, using a simpliﬁed model, we
estimate the order of magnitude of the cross-section and the shape of the spectrum.
Hence, let us start from the process of scattering of a hydrogen atom in the Coulomb
ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely heavy source, accompanied by emission of light. After obtaining
the cross-section we shall argue that this elementary process has similar features to the
atomic collision and we shall use the results to estimate the number of photons in the
SL ﬂash.

We employ the standard non-relativistic hamiltonian whose leading part H0 con-
tains the operators of the kinetic energy and the electron-proton interaction. The
perturbation H1 in the Coulomb gauge, after neglecting A2 terms, take the following

We have checked, that the contributions to the amplitude

of the intermediate

states in which the electron and proton form a 1S state are negligible, due to a2
suppression of the photon emission matrix elements. On the other hand, the spectrum
of hydrogen atom has a large gap between the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state
and the excited bound states lie close to each other. It also may be proven that the
intermediate continuum states with energies En >
give a subleading contribution
to the amplitude. It seems therefore quite natural to approximate the energy diﬀerence

. Of course, this
approximation works only for k signiﬁcantly smaller than the ∆E. Now, we can employ
the completness relation for the ΨP,n states in the electron-proton sector and perform

2 is the electric form-factor of the ground
where q = P ′
state of the hydrogen atom of the Bohr radius given by a0. As expected, there occur
cancellations between the form-factors, and the amplitude vanishes for vanishing k. We
also notice that the terms proportional to εk(P + P ′) are suppressed by a small factor
a0k as compared to term containing εkq thus we retain only the later. Furthermore
we may drop the 1/mp terms.

me f (βq + k) and α

A more subtle problem arises when comparing the relative importance of the con-
tributions β
me f (αq). The answer seems to depend on the details of
the process in the physically relevant parameter space. For example, if the energy of
the collision falls between 5 and 10 eV then the ﬁrst term dominates for k > 3 eV while
for k < 3 eV the contribution of the other term is more important giving rise to an
additional “red” peak of spectral density. However, if we take an atom with the mass
of 16 MH and the Bohr radius a0 (modelling the oxygen atom) this peak would move to
energies k < 0.5 eV i.e. to the experimentally inaccesible region. Besides, the α
me f (αq)
term is very sensitive to the details of the charge form-factor of the scattering atom.
On the other hand, the β
me f (βq + k) part is universal i.e very weakly dependent on
the details of the atom structure. In what follows, we shall focus only on this universal
contribution of the amplitude which is relevant for the shape of the spectrum in its
large k part. By this neglection we underestimate the number of the emitted photons.

Let us point out, that the obtained cross-section corresponds to a subprocess in
which the nucleus scatters oﬀ the Coulomb ﬁeld and the electron cloud radiates a pho-
ton when recombining around the scattered nucleus. The other contributions to the
amplitude were shown to be subleading and neglected. The spectral density resulting
from this cross-section rises as k4 for small k i.e faster than this observed in the SL
experiments. For k closer to the kinematical cut-oﬀ, the initial k4 dependece is mod-
iﬃed and one gets approximately quadratic behavior over wide range of k which is still
steeper that it follows from the experimental data. However, let us remind, that in our
picture, the SL spectrum would be given by a convolution of the spectra of individual
collisions with the (unknown) distribution of the collision energy, so the two spectra
may diﬀer from each other.

After integration of the diﬀerential cross-section (6) over the energy, we get the
total cross-section σtot(E) growing with the collision energy E approximately as Eν
with ν
3.5. For the choice of parameters relevant for the hydrogen atom, Z = 1 and
a typical collision energy of 7 eV (the choice is suggested by the observed cut-oﬀ on
31 m2. Taking this number and
photon spectrum) we obtain σ0 = σtot(7 eV) = 1.3
the parameters implied by the known facts concerning the bubble dynamics we may,
after some modiﬁcations, make a crude estimate of the number Nf of photons produced
in one ﬂash. We assume, that the bubble is ﬁlled with a mixture of atoms of a noble gas
and atoms of other element (oxygen or nitrogen) 2 with atomic numbers ZN and ZO,
masses MN and MO and concentrations nN and nO correspondingly. The predictions
for collisions of an atom of noble gas with an atom of, say, oxygen may be formulated
on the basis of the previous calculation. Namely, for the momentum transfers relevant
for SL the condition a2
1 is fulﬁlled and the charge form-factors for the electrons
suppress their contribution to the scattering amplitude — the electrons cannot absorb
momenta much larger than their average momentum in the atom. Then the nucleus of
the noble atom acts as a bare source of the Coulomb ﬁeld. Furthermore, the amplitude
of the electromagnetic radiation from the noble atom is smaller then from the oxygen.
It is caused by the smaller polarizability of the former atom which is governed by the
relevant ionisation energy. Thus the cancellations which occur due to the destructive
interferece do not reduce the cross-section substantially in contrast with the case of a
collision of two objects of the same kind. This feature was reﬂected in our model by
neglecting the radiation from the source of the Coulomb ﬁeld. Of course, to complete
the analogy, we should use in the formulae the reduced mass of the two atoms instead
the mass of the hydrogen atom and include the modiﬁcation of charges by ZN for the
source of the ﬁeld and ZO for the scattering atom. The charge ZO enters in fourth power
since it contribute both to scattering and the radiation. Therefore we approximate Nf
by the following expression:

[9] and v

wave description of gas dynamics lower values of the radius are prefered, however the
increase in concentration caused by the additional compression may easily compensate
the decrease of the reaction volume. In fact, the true concentration in the radiating
region is not measured, and the models provide us only with ambigous predictions.

The limitting value of the concentration is
some room here and the constraints imposed on the cross-section (7) by the experiment
are not very stringent. It is also very probable, that the proposed mechanism is not
responsible for the emission of all photons but rather supplements the list of processes
studied in [5]. In this case, including it could, in particular, improve the shape of the
spectrum obtained in [5].

We can also take into account that, as follows from [13], the SL bubble is ﬁlled
mainly with a noble gas, and may contain only some admixture of oxygen (which may
be continously provided from water) by modifying the ratio nO : nN , keeping nN + nO
ﬁxed. Thus for 10% of the oxygen in the gas mixture the number of photons in one
ﬂash drops to about 2

105.

·

In conclusion, we propose a novel light-emitting mechanism in sonoluminescence,
in which the photons are radiated from atoms disturbed by collisions. The number
of produced photons has the proper order of magnitude, however the resulting photon
spectrum comes out somewhat to steep. The spectral density is featureless and univer-
sal. Our model of SL requires the gas temperature to be approximately 30 000 K, and
1000 n0. The bubble should contain atoms of
the concentration of the order of 500
two diﬀerent gases: a noble gas and a gas with smaller ionisation energy e.g. oxygen,
however one of the gases may appear at much smaller concentration than the other.
The emitting process is insensitive to external magnetic ﬁeld and does not require the
presence of molecules which are expected to dissociate in the gas temperature sug-
gested by the photon spectrum. Although the model we have elaborated is based on
the simpliﬁed assumptions we expect that the obtained predictions estimate correctly
the order of magnitude of the cross-section. Therefore this gives the strong motiva-
tion to further study of the subject which would probably require the use of numerical
analysis if one intends to cover all the details of the process.

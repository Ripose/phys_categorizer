Energies, transition rates, and electron electric dipole moment (EDM) enhancement factors are
calculated for low-lying states of Ce IV and Pr V using relativistic many-body perturbation theory.
This study is related to recent investigations of the more complicated Gd IV ion, which is promising
for electron EDM experiments. The ions Ce IV and Pr V both have a single valence electron,
permitting one to carry out reliable ab-initio calculations of energy levels, transition rates and other
atomic properties using well developed computational methods.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, searches for an electron electric dipole mo-
ment (EDM) in atoms and molecules have gained con-
siderable interest. Since an electron EDM violates time-
reversal symmetry and parity, the discovery of an EDM
would have many implications for modern fundamen-
tal theories (a general overview is given by Khriplovich
and Lamoreaux [1]). The best limit on the value of the
electron EDM was obtained by Regan et al. [2] in Tl,
de < 1.6 × 10−27 e cm. Although there is a large en-
hancement (∼ 600) of the electron EDM in Tl, the den-
sity of atoms in a beam is much lower than in a solid-
state system. To utilize the advantage of high densities,
it has been proposed to use Gadolinium Gallium Gar-
net Gd3Ga5O12 or Gadolinium Iron Garnet Gd3Fe5O12
(densities ∼ 1022/cc) in EDM experiments [3, 4]. There
are various features of these materials that make them
particularly useful for such experiments. For example,
magneto-electric eﬀects are forbidden owing to the FCC
symmetry of the crystals, simplifying the exclusion of
systematics; the crystal Gd3Fe5O12 has a very high re-
sistivity (≫ 1016 Ω-cm); and spin alignment is relatively
easy. The electron EDM enhancement for the Gd3+ ion
(∼ 2 − 3) is much smaller than for Tl; nevertheless there
is a substantial gain in the number of atoms.

Motivated by proposed EDM measurements, calcula-
tions of EDM enhancement have been performed recently

[5, 6]. Core polarization eﬀects in Gd IV were discussed
by Dzuba et al. [7] and found to decrease the size of
EDM enhancement factor from -3.3 to -2.2 . Thus, there
is a strong sensitivity of the EDM enhancement to many-
body eﬀects and further investigation is necessary.

The ion Gd+3, which has a 4f 7 ground-state conﬁgu-
ration is extremely complicated and diﬃcult for atomic
theory, though some understanding was gained by Dzuba
et al.
[7] using a relativistic conﬁguration-interaction
(RCI) method and the widely used Cowan [8] code.
As mentioned above, core polarization was found to be
substantial. For example, to match the experimental
4f → 5d transition energies, scaling factors of 0.8 and
0.85 for Coulomb integrals were used in the RCI and
Cowan codes, respectively.
In addition, a polarization
potential was introduced in RCI code to match experi-
mental energies and a systematic energy shift of ∼ 18, 000
cm−1 was made in the Cowan code. This shift can be at-
tributed to core polarization by a single valence electron.
An ab-initio investigation of correlation should help to
understand these empirical adjustments. The simplest
ions (those having a single 4f valence electron) which
exhibit core-polarization eﬀects similar to Gd IV are Ce
IV and Pr V. To gain a clearer understanding of the role
of core polarization and other many-body eﬀects in Ce IV
and Pr V, we calculate energies, dipole transition matrix
elements, and EDM enhancement factors for low lying
states using relativistic many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT).

The present calculations of energies are carried out to
third order in MBPT using the methods developed ear-
lier to study the Li, Na, and Cu isoelectronic sequences
[9, 10, 11]. The calculations of transition matrix ele-
ments is also carried out to third order in MBPT using
the methods developed in [12] to treat the alkali atoms
and alkalilike ions. Here, we use the gauge-independent
version of the third-order MBPT code described in [13].

The calculations of electron EDM enhancement factors,
which involve a sum over intermediate states, are carried
out in the random-phase approximation (RPA) following
a procedure similar to that described in [14].

It should be mentioned that Ce+3, which has a 4f5/2
ground state and an observed magnetic moment 2.3-2.5
µB can be embedded into garnet crystals and used in
EDM experiments of the type proposed in [3]. In those
experiments, a strong electric ﬁeld polarizes ions which
in turn produce a small magnetic ﬁeld that is measured
in a sensitive SQUID detector. The magnetic ﬁeld at low
temperatures is proportional to the product of the elec-
tric dipole moment of the ion and its magnetic moment.
The estimated EDM of Gd+3 as is a factor of about 3
larger than for Ce+3 and the magnetic moment of Gd+3
(7.9-8.0 µB) is also about three times larger; therefore,
there is an overall advantage of nine in Gd+3 compared
to Ce+3. Nevertheless, the Ce+3 ion could still compete
in setting experimental limits on the electron EDM owing
to the fact that its ionic EDM has signiﬁcantly smaller
theoretical uncertainty.

II. CALCULATION OF ENERGIES

First-,

second- and third-order Coulomb energies
E(n), n = 1..3, and ﬁrst- and second-order Breit ener-
gies B(n), n = 1, 2, calculated using methods described
in Refs. [9, 10, 11], are presented in Table I along with
the resultant theoretical energies Etot and predicted ener-
gies ENIST from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) given by Martin et al. [15]. We see
that second-order corrections are large and improve the
accuracy of the ﬁrst-order Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) en-
ergies. Third-order MBPT further improves the ground
state energy. However, the third-order correction is rela-
tively large (roughly one-third of the second order) and
overshoots the experimental value, which indicates that
oscillations in higher orders are likely. Using a geomet-
ric progression with q = −1/3 we can extrapolate the
second- and third-order values to give a limiting ground-
state energy −296420 cm−1 for Ce+3, in close agreement
with the predicted value from [15]. The corresponding ex-
trapolation for Pr+4 gives −468290 cm−1 diﬀering from
the predicted ground-state energy given in [15] by about
4000 cm−1. This rather large diﬀerence casts doubt on
the threshold energy of Pr V predicted in [15] and ex-
plains the large diﬀerences with the NIST energies seen
in lower half of Table I.

In Refs. [9, 10, 11], where the ionic ground-states were
2s, 3s, and 4s, respectively, the third-order correction
was uniformly much smaller than the second-order cor-
rection. The relatively large size of the third-order cor-
rections in Ce IV and Pr V arise because of the double-
well feature of the 4f Coulomb potential discussed, for
example, by Cheng and Froese-Fischer [16].

III. CALCULATION OF TRANSITION MATRIX
ELEMENTS AND TRANSITION RATES

Transition matrix elements provide another test of
quality of atomic-structure calculations and another mea-
sure of the size of correlation corrections. Third-order
MBPT reduced matrix elements for transitions between
low-lying states of Ce+3 and Pr+4 are presented in Ta-
ble II. The ﬁrst-order reduced matrix elements Z (1) are
obtained from length-form DHF calculations. Length-
form and velocity-form matrix elements diﬀer typically
by 10%. Second-order matrix elements in the table Z (2),
which include Z (1), are extended to include all higher-
order corrections associated with the random-phase ap-
proximation. These second-order calculations are prac-
In the present calculations,
tically gauge independent.
length- and velocity-form matrix elements in the RPA
agree to six or more digits. The third-order matrix el-
ements Z (3) include Z (2) plus Brueckner-orbital (BO),
structural radiation, and normalization corrections de-
scribed, for example, in [12]. These calculations are car-
ried out in a gauge-independent manner, including ap-
propriate derivative terms, as described in [13]. We trun-
cated our basis set to include only those partial waves

with l ≤ 8, and found that length- and velocity-form
third-order reduced matrix elements agreed to 4 digits.

As can be seen in Table II, RPA corrections are very
large, 10-40%, being largest for 4f → 5d transitions, and
must be taken into account. Such behavior can be at-
tributed to core shielding which is substantial because
valence electrons penetrate deeply into the core. Third-
order corrections are smaller, 2-4% scaling as 1/Zion. If
such scaling holds in higher orders, we can estimate the
accuracy of our calculations to be 0.4-0.8%. The domi-
nant contribution in third order comes from the BO cor-
rection which is approximately equal to the sum of the
other third-order corrections.

Transition rates A (s−1), oscillator strengths f , and
wavelengths λ (˚A) for electric dipole transitions between
low-lying states of Ce IV and Pr V are given in Table III.
These data are calculated using the dipole matrix ele-
ments Z (3) from Table II and predicted NIST transition
energies [15]. In the two ﬁnal columns of Table III, we
compare our MBPT wavelengths with the wavelengths
[15]. We also compare our MBPT oscillator
from Ref.
strengths with theoretical oscillator strengths obtained
by Migdalek and Wyrozumska [17]. The data in [17]
were obtained using a relativistic model potential (RMP)
approach together with a core-polarization (CP) model
potential. Our data and that from Ref. [17] agree well
for 5d − 6p and 6s − 6p transitions but diﬀer for 4f − 5d
transition where f values are very small.

IV. EDM ENHANCEMENT

A. Basic equations

According to Schiﬀ’s theorem [18], the electric dipole
moment of an atom induced by an intrinsic electron EDM
vanishes in the nonrelativistic limit; however, as shown
by Sandars [19], the atomic EDM is nonvanishing rela-
tivistically and can be a large multiple of the intrinsic
electron moment for heavy atoms. If we assume that the
electron has an intrinsic EDM de, then the EDM of a

Lowest-order calculations of the induced atomic EDM
are carried out in a frozen-core V N −1 DHF potential.
Such calculations were shown in [14] to be very sensitive
to correlation corrections. For that reason, the lowest-
order “bare” matrix elements in Eq. (4) are replaced by
“dressed” RPA matrix elements.

C. Calculations of EDM enhancement factors

,

(5)

The sums over intermediate states in Eqs. (4-7) are
carried out using basis functions obtained as linear com-
binations of B-splines as described in [20]. We use 40
splines of order 7 and constrain the ions to lie in a cavity
of radius R = 35 a.u. for Ce+3 and 30 a.u. for Pr+4.

where the index a extends over all core orbitals and
the index n extends over all virtual orbitals permitted

A detailed breakdown of the contributions to D for 4f
states of Ce IV is given in Table IV, where we list the

DHF approximation, D(1), the second-order correction
D(2), the RPA approximation, DRPA, and the individual

contributions to the second-order and RPA corrections
from the dipole and weak-interaction matrix elements.
One can see from the table that the correlation correc-
tions to the weak-interaction matrix element are compa-
rable to or larger than the lowest order matrix element.
Moreover, there are signiﬁcant changes in these correla-
tion corrections going from second-order MBPT to full
RPA calculations.

Finally, in Table V, we present DHF and RPA values
of the EDM enhancement factors D/de for the low-lying
4f , 5d, 6s, and 6p states of Ce IV and Pr V.

V. CONCLUSION

We have studied energies, transition probabilities, and
EDM enhancement factors for Ce+3 and Pr+4. We found
that perturbation theory converges quite slowly and that
RPA corrections are the dominant correlation correc-
tions for transitions. We use our third-order MBPT with
“dressed” matrix elements to obtain accurate transition
rates. The most interesting discovery is that RPA cor-
rections modify lowest-order values of the EDM enhance-
ment factor signiﬁcantly.

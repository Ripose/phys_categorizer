Coherent control of atom dynamics in an optical lattice

Abstract

On the basis of a simple exactly solvable model we discuss the possibilities for

state preparation and state control of atoms in a periodic optical potential.

In addition to the periodic potential a uniform force with an arbitrary time

dependence is applied. The method is based on a formal expression for the full

evolution operator in the tight-binding limit. This allows us to describe the

dynamics in terms of operator algebra, rather than in analytical expansions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle moving in a periodic potential form energy

bands (the Bloch bands) that are separated by bandgaps. The eigenstate within a band is

characterized by the quasimomentum, which determines the phase diﬀerence between two

points separated by a period. An initially localized wavepacket typically propagates through

space, leading to unbounded motion. When an additional uniform force is applied, the Bloch

bands break up into a ladder of equally spaced energy levels, which are called the Wannier-

Stark ladder. In this case, a wavepacket of the particle extending over several periods can

exhibit bounded oscillatory motion, termed Bloch oscillation, at a frequency determined by

∗

1

the level separation in the ladder. These early results of the quantum theory of electrons

in solid crystals [1–4] have regained interest recently due to the advent of optical lattices

for atoms. These lattices are formed when cold atoms are trapped in the periodic potential

created by the superposition of a number of traveling light waves [5–8]. In contrast to the

case of electrons in crystal lattices, these optical lattice ﬁelds have virtually no defects, they

can be switched on and oﬀ at will, and dissipative eﬀects can be largely controlled. The

phenomenon of Bloch oscillations has ﬁrst been observed for cesium atoms in optical lattices

[9]. The uniform external force is mimicked by a linear variation of the frequency of one

of the counterpropagating traveling waves, thereby creating an accelerated standing wave.

By applying a modulation on the standing-wave position, Rabi oscillations between Bloch

bands, as well as the level structure of the Wannier-Stark ladder has been observed for

sodium atoms in an optical lattice [10]. Theoretical studies of transitions between ladders

have also been presented [11]. Bloch oscillations have also been demonstrated for a light

beam propagating in an array of waveguides, with a linear variation of the refractive index

imposed by a temperature gradient [12].

When the applied uniform force is oscillating in time, the motion of a particle in a

periodic potential is usually unbounded. However, it has been predicted that the motion re-

mains bounded for speciﬁc values of the ratio of the modulation frequency and the strength

of the force [13]. Similar eﬀects of dynamical localization, including routes to chaos, have

been studied experimentally for optical lattices, including both amplitude and phase mod-

ulation of the uniform force [14]. Phase transitions have been predicted for atoms in two

incompatible periodic optical potentials imposed by bichromatic standing light waves [15].

In the present paper we discuss the Wannier-Stark system with a time-dependent force,

as a means of preparing the state of particles in a periodic potential. We derive an exact

expression for the evolution operator of the particle, with an arbitrary time-dependent force.

This allows one to apply the combination of delocalizing dynamics in the absence of the

uniform force with the periodic dynamics induced by a uniform force for coherent control of

the state of the particles. Exact solutions in the case of a constant uniform force have been

2

obtained before by analytical techniques [17,18]. The operator method phenomena induced

by an oscillating force to be described exactly in a uniﬁed scheme. Examples are dynamical

localization and fractional Wannier-Stark ladders.

The model is described in one dimension. However, this is no real restriction. Under the

assumption of nearest-neighbor interaction, the corresponding 2D or 3D problem exactly

factorizes into a product of 1D solutions.

The quantummechanical motion of atoms in a periodic optical potential V (x) with period

a, is described by the Hamiltonian

(2)

We assume that the atoms are suﬃciently cooled, so that only the lowest energy band is

populated. The ground state in well n located at x = na is indicated as

. These states

play the role of the basis of localized Wannier states. For simplicity we make the tight-

binding limit, where only the ground levels in neighboring wells are coupled. When we

choose the zero of energy at the ground level in a well, the Hamiltonian (1) projected on

these ground levels is deﬁned by

H0 =

The raising and lowering operators B+ and B− are each other’s Hermitian conjugate, and

each one of them is unitary. The frequency Ω measures the coupling between neighboring

wells, due to tunneling through the barriers. We shall allow the coupling to depend on time.

The eigenstates of H0 are directly found by diagonalizing the corresponding matrix. These

states are the Bloch states

Obviously, the states

An additional uniform force is described by adding to the Hamiltonian the term

the basis of the Wannier states, this term is diagonal, and it is represented as

with H0 and H1 deﬁned by eqs. (2) and (5), in terms of the operators B± and B0. We shall

also need expressions for the operators B± and B0 acting on a Bloch state. These can be

found from the deﬁnition of the operators and the expansions (3). One easily ﬁnds that

In Bloch representation the operators have the signiﬁcance B± = exp(

(i/a)(d/dk), which is conﬁrmed by the commutation rules (8). The Wannier states may be

viewed as discrete position eigenstates, with B0 the corresponding position operator. The

Bloch states play the role of momentum eigenstates, and the ﬁnite range of their eigenvalues

within the Brillouin zone reﬂects the discreteness of the position eigenvalues.

C. Operator algebra

The basic operators B± and B0 obey the commutation rules

[B0, B±] =

B± , [B+, B−] = 0 .

±

In order to derive exact expressions for the evolution operator corresponding to the Hamil-

tonian (6), we need several operator identities involving these operators B0 and B±. The

identities

directly follow from the commutation rules (8), and they lead the transformation rules

III. OPERATOR DESCRIPTION OF EVOLUTION

In this section we derive expressions for the evolution operator U(t, 0), which transforms

an arbitrary initial state

as

Ψ(t)

= U(t, 0)
|

Ψ(0)

i

. The results are valid for any time-

dependence of the uniform force and the coupling between neighboring wells, as speciﬁed

by ∆(t) and Ω(t). A time-dependent coupling represents the case that the intensity of the

lattice beams is varied. We express the evolution operator in the factorized form

U(t, 0) = U1(t, 0)U0(t, 0) ,

(12)

5

where U1(t, 0) = exp[

iφ(t)B0] gives the evolution corresponding to the Hamiltonian H1

alone, in terms of the phase shift

−

φ(t) =

dt′ ∆(t′) .

t

(13)

(14)

(16)

From the evolution equation for U with the Hamiltonian (6), while using the transformation

(9) we ﬁnd the evolution equation

−

2 (cid:16)

eiφ(t)B+ + e−iφ(t)B−

U0(t) .

(cid:17)

Since this equation only contains the commuting operators B+ and B−, it can easily be

integrated. In fact, the solution is given by eq. (10) with the time-dependent values of the

real parameters α and β deﬁned by the relations

α(t)eiβ(t) =

dt′Ω(t′)eiφ(t′) .

t

Z
0

Combining this solution with the deﬁnition of U1, leads to a closed expression for the evolu-

tion operator U(t, 0) for an arbitrary time dependence of the uniform force, in terms of the

parameters α, β and φ, deﬁned in (13) and (15). The result is U(t, 0)

R(α, β, φ), with R

deﬁned by

R(α, β, φ) = ei(β−φ)B0 exp

i

1
2

(cid:16) −

α(B+ + B−)

e−iβB0 .
(cid:17)

This deﬁnes the unitary operator R as a function of the three parameters α, β and φ. The

result is valid for an arbitrary time dependence of the force and the coupling, described by

∆(t) and Ω(t). The characteristics of the evolution of an arbitrary initial state is determined

by the properties of the operators R as a function of α, β and φ. Mathematically, these

operators form a three-parameter group, which is generated by the three operators B± and

B0.

On the basis of the Wannier states, the contribution of the operator B0 in (16) is trivial,

whereas the eﬀect of the exponent containing B± can be evaluated by ﬁrst expanding a Wan-

nier state in Bloch states, for which the action of this exponent is simple. Then reexpressing

the Bloch states in Wannier states, we ﬁnd

For the evolution operator (16) in Bloch representation we can just use the form of the

operators B± and B0, as given in Sec. II B. This leads to the result

This shows that the quasimomentum as a function of time varies as k(t) = k(0)

φ(t)/a,

−

with φ(t) given in (13). The parameter φ determines the shift of the quasimomentum during

the evolution. The expressions (18) and (19) clarify the signiﬁcance of the three parameters

α, β and φ that specify the evolution operator.

B. Heisenberg picture

The transport properties of any initial state is conveniently described by the evolution

of the operators in the Heisenberg picture. Since any evolution operator can be written

in the form of R(α, β, φ) for the appropriate values of the parameters, we can view R†BR

as the Heisenberg operator corresponding to any operator B. The Heisenberg operators

corresponding to B± can be expressed as

R†(α, β, φ)B±R(α, β, φ) = e±iφB± ,

(20)

which is directly shown by using eq. (9). Since B± = exp(

ika) in Bloch representation,

∓

this conﬁrms the signiﬁcance of φ as the shift of the value of the quasimomentum.

After using the transformation property (11), one ﬁnds the Heisenberg operator corre-

sponding to the position operator B0 as

7

R†(α, β, φ)B0R(α, β, φ) = B0 +

Then the quasimomentum is initially centered around the value k0 = θ/a. For simplicity, we

assume moreover that the distribution over Wannier states is even in n, so that

The initial average position of the particle is located at n = 0. In order to evaluate the

(23). The symmetry of the distribution implies that

Notice that the parameters b1 and b2 are real numbers between 0 and 1. In the limit of

a wide initial wavepacket, determined by coeﬃcients cn whose absolute values vary slowly

with n, the parameters b1 and b2 both will approach 1, and the width σ will not vary during

the evolution. In the opposite special case that the initial state is the single Wannier state

a phase diﬀerence can be created or modiﬁed in a controlled way, simply by imposing a

time-dependent force that gives rise to the right value of φ. Notice that in these expressions

(34), θ and β enter in an equivalent fashion. The position and the width of the Gaussian

distribution can be controlled at will by adapting the force to the desired value of β.

We recall that the results of this chapter are valid for an arbitray time-dependent force

∆(t), which determines the time-dependent values of the parameters α, β and φ as speciﬁed

in eqs. (13) and (15). In the subsequent sections, we specialize these expressions for constant

or oscillating values of the uniform force.

V. CONSTANT UNIFORM FORCE AND BLOCH OSCILLATIONS

A. Wannier-Stark ladder of states

The case of a constant force is the standard situation where Bloch oscillations occur.

When ∆ and Ω are constant, the Hamiltonian is time-independent, and then it is convenient

to introduce the normalized eigenstates

of H. When we expand these eigenstates in

the Wannier states as

Since the functions Zm(k) as deﬁned by (36) are periodic in k with period 2π/a, the same

must be true for the expressions (38). Hence, the frequency eigenvalues must be an integer

multiple of ∆, so that we can choose ωm = m∆, with integer m. For these values of the

eigenfrequencies, the coeﬃcients c(m)

n

follow from the Fourier expansion of Zm, with the

result

c(m)

ψmi

= Jm−n(Ω/∆) .

We ﬁnd that the total Hamiltonian H has the same eigenvalues as H1. Apparently, the

energy shifts due to the coupling between the Wannier states as expressed by H0 cancel

each other. Since the energy eigenvalues are integer multiples of ∆, each solution of the

Schr¨odinger equation is periodic in time with period 2π/∆, and the same is true for the

evolution operator U(t) given in eq. (16). This also implies that an initial localized state

remains localized at all times, due to the addition of the uniform external force. The eigen-

are the Wannier-Stark ladder of states [10]. They form a discrete orthonormal

basis of the ﬁrst energy band, and they are intermediate between the Wannier and the Bloch

states

This is already quite diﬀerent when only two Wannier states are populated initially.

Consider the initial state

Then the average position can be evaluated from eq. (22), for the values of α and β as given

which shows that the packet displays a harmonically oscillating behavior. The amplitude

of the oscillation is governed by the ratio Ω/∆, which is half the maximum amplitude for

Bloch oscillations of a wavepacket with a large width (see Sec. V C). This amplitude must be

appreciable in order that interband coupling induced by the uniform force remains negligible,

as we have assumed throughout this paper. The distribution pn =

period, both for the initial single Wannier state and for the inital state (43) is illustrated in

13

Fig. 1. This demonstrates that a strong displacement can already be induced by evolution of

a superposition state of just two neighboring Wannier states, with a speciﬁc phase diﬀerence.

This displacement arises from the interference between the transition amplitudes from the

two initial states to the same ﬁnal state

C. Bloch oscillations and breathing of a Gaussian wavepacket

The evolution of a Gaussian wavepacket as discussed in Sec. IV B is specialized to the

present case of a constant force after substituting the expressions (40) in eqs. (32)-(34). We

the identity

This demonstrates that the wavepacket oscillates harmonically in position with frequency ∆,

and with amplitude Ω/∆ in units of the lattice distance a. The velocity of the wavepacket

is found from the time derivative of (45), with the result

v(t) =

aΩ sin(θ

∆t) .

It is noteworthy that this expression (46) coincides exactly with the expression for the

group velocity dE/¯hdk, with the derivative evaluated at the time-dependent value of the

quasimomentum (θ

∆t)/a, with E = ¯hΩ cos(ka) the dispersion relation between energy and

−

quasimomentum in the absence of the uniform force, as given in Sec. II A. Apparently, the

expression for the group velocity retains its validity also in the presence of the uniform force.

Of course, the concept of Bloch oscillations of the wavepacket as a whole has signiﬁcance

only when the amplitude Ω/∆ of the oscillation is large compared with the width σ of the

packet, which in turn must extend over many lattice sites.

The time-dependent width σ of the Gaussian packet is found from eq. (34) in the form

Hence the variance of the position deviates from its initial value by an oscillating term.

The amplitude of this oscillation is governed by the ratio (Ω/2∆σ0)2. The initial width is

restored whenever one of the terms in brackets vanish. This happens twice during every

Bloch period, except when θ = π/2, when these two instants coincide. This combined

breathing and oscillating behavior is illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, for various values of the

relatice phase θ. Notice that the oscillation is always harmonic with the Bloch frequency

∆. This is due to the simple form of the dispersion relation for the case of nearest-neighbor

interaction. The time dependence of the variance is a superposition of terms with frequencies

∆ and 2∆.

D. Zero external force

In the absence of the external force, we can take the limit ∆

0 in the results of the

→

previous subsections. In particular, this gives φ = β = 0, α(t) = Ωt. Then the evolution of

an initial Wannier state

which shows that the free spreading of an initial Wannier state after a time t gives Wannier

populations equal to pn =

Jn(Ωt)

2 [19]. The mean-square displacement increases linearly

in time, as σ = Ωt/√2. This shows that the spreading is unbounded in the absence of an

external force. The self-propagator p0(t) decays to zero for large times. The phase diﬀerence

between neighboring sites is

π/2 at all times. For only two coupled wells, the coupling

would give rise to Rabi oscillations with frequency Ω. Equation (48) can be viewed as the

generalization to the case of an inﬁnite chain of wells.

As one would expect in the absence of a uniform force, the group velocity takes the constant

value v =

aΩ sin θ, which leads to unbounded motion of the packet (except for θ = 0

or

π). Usually, the width increases indeﬁnitely during he propagation. However, for the

special values θ =

π/2 the width is constant, and the packets propagates as a solitary wave.

Notice that such a phase diﬀerence between neighboring Wannier states arises spontaneously

when a single Wannier state spreads in the absence of a uniform force.

VI. OSCILLATING FORCE

Other situations of practical interest arise when the uniform force has an oscillating

component. Examples are the coupling between the states in the Wannier-Stark ladder

[10], and dynamical localization for special values of the amplitude-frequency ratio of the

oscillation [13,14]. The situation of an oscillating force is also decribed by the operator

description of Sec. III A. We give some results below.

A. AC force only

∆(t) = δ cos(ωt) ,

The situation of a harmonically oscillating uniform force can be expressed as

(50)

(51)

so that φ = (δ/ω) sin(ωt). Then according to (15) the parameters α and β are speciﬁed by

the equalities

where we used the expansion deﬁning the ordinary Bessel functions, given in section III A.

The ﬁrst term in (51) increases linearly with time, whereas the summation is bounded,

and periodic in time with period T = 2π/ω. The behavior of α and β as deﬁned by (51)

is quite complicated in general. However, for large times the value of α, and thereby the

spreading of an initial Wannier state, is the same as in the absence of the uniform force,

16

with Ω replaced by the reduced eﬀective coupling ΩJ0(δ/ω). After one period T , the values

of the parameters become simple, and we ﬁnd β = φ = 0, α = ΩT J0(δ/ω). The evolution

operator U(T ) during one period T is simply given by the operator R deﬁned in (16), at

these values of the parameters. The eigenstates of the evolution operator R = U(T ) are

simply the Bloch states

k

. The eigenvalues can be expressed as the exp(

(k)T /¯h), with

(52)

the corresponding values of the quasienergy, which are strictly speaking only deﬁned modulo

¯hω. The quasienergy bandwidth is reduced by the factor J0(δ/ω), compared with the energy

bandwidth in the absence of the uniform force.

When the ratio δ/ω of the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillating force coincides

with a zero of the Bessel function J0, no unbounded spreading occurs, and an initially local-

ized state remains localized at all times, with a periodically varying mean-square displace-

ment. The quasienergy bandwidth is reduced to zero in this case. This eﬀect of dynamical

localization has been discussed before for electrons in crystals [13]. A related eﬀect of an ef-

fective switch-oﬀ of atom-ﬁeld coupling occurs for a two-level atom in a frequency-modulated

ﬁeld when the ratio of the amplitude-frequency ratio of the modulation equals a zero of the

Bessel function J0. This eﬀect, which leads to population trapping in a two-level atom, has

recently been discussed by Agarwal and Harshawardhan [20].

B. AC and DC force

A constant uniform force creates Wannier-Stark states with equidistant energy values.

An additional oscillating force can induce transitions between these states. Therefore, we

consider the force speciﬁed by

∆(t) = ∆0 + δ cos(ωt) .

(53)

Then the value of the parameters φ, α and β are

(54)

In general, each term in the summation is bounded and periodic, but the diﬀerent periods

can be incompatible. Moreover, whenever ∆0 + nω = 0, the corresponding summand attains

the unbounded form ΩtJn(δ/ω). At such a resonant value of ∆0, the spreading of an initially

localized state becomes unbounded, and the particle becomes delocalized. This delocaliza-

tion is suppressed again when the ratio δ/ω is equal to a zero of the corresponding Bessel

function Jn. This is a simpliﬁed version of the phenomenon of fractional Wannier-Stark

ladders, which has recently been observed and discussed [21,22].

The quasienergy values are again determined by the eigenstates of the evolution operator

U(T ) for one period of the oscillating force. This operator is equal to the general operator

R deﬁned in (16), with the parameters

α = 2Ω sin(∆0T /2)

These expressions are correct whenever ∆0 + nω is nonzero for all values of n. Since these

values of the parameters can be directly mapped onto the values (40) specifying the evolution

with a constant uniform force, also the eigenvectors and corresponding quasienergies are

immediately found. The eigenvectors of R can be expressed as

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the Wannier-Stark system, which is characterized by the Hamiltonian

(6), in terms of the operators B± and B0. The present interest in this model arises from

the dynamics of atoms in a periodic optical potential, with an additionally applied uniform

external force. We adopted the tight-binding limit, which implied nearest-neighbor inter-

action only. This gives rise to an explicit simple dispersion relation between energy and

quasimomentum, which makes the model exactly solvable. From the commutation proper-

ties of the basic operators we obtain eq. (16) for the evolution operator for an arbitrary

time dependence of the uniform force, where the three parameters are deﬁned in (13) and

(15). As shown in Secs. III B and IV, the parameter φ determines the shift in the value

of the quasimomentum, whereas α and β determine the evolution of the average position

and the width of a wavepacket. A particle starting in a single Wannier state has a uniform

distribution over the quasimomentum, and cannot change its average position, wheras the

width of its wavepacket is simply measured by α. On the other hand, even when only two

neighboring states are populated initially, the wavepacket can display an appreciable mo-

tion. In Sec. IV B it is demonstrated that an initially Gaussian packet remains Gaussian

at all times. This remains true when the initial state has a non-zero expectation value of

the quasimomentum, which is described as an initial phase diﬀerence between neighboring

Wannier states.

These results, which are valid for a uniform force with an arbitrary time dependence,

unify and extend earlier results obtained for a constant or an oscillating uniform force. A

19

constant force induces Bloch oscillations of a wavepacket, and we obtain a simple expression

for the amplitude of the oscillation and for the time dependence of the width of a wavepacket.

For an oscillating force, the operator method shows that the quasienergy bands can be

evaluated directly in terms of the value of the parameter α after one oscillation period.

This produces an exactly solvable model for dynamical localization and fractional Wannier-

Stark ladders.

In general, by selecting a proper time-dependence of the force or of the

coupling between wells, thereby realize the desired values of the parameters α, β and φ,

we can coherently control the width and the position of a wavepacket, as well as the phase

diﬀerence between neighboring sites.

Quasiperiodic Atom Optics, Focusing, and Wave packet Rephasing

(September 23, 1998)

We propose a laser ﬁeld conﬁguration which acts as a quasiperiodic atom optical diﬀraction
grating. Analytical and computational results for the atomic center-of-mass wavefunction after the
grating reveal a quasiperiodic density pattern, a semiclassical focusing eﬀect, and a quasiperiodic
self-imaging of the atomic wavefunction analogous to a Talbot eﬀect.

Increased attention has been given to periodic atom optical systems and to drawing parallels between solid state
physics and the corresponding atom optics in an easily-controlled environment [1]. In the transient interaction regime,
periodic atom optical elements have been used for spatial- [2] and time-domain [3,4] interferometry, atom focusing and
lithography [5], and the Fresnel self-imaging (Talbot eﬀect [6]) of an atomic wave packet [7]. In addition, optical lattices
[8] have been used to simulate solid state eﬀects using atomic de Broglie waves. These atoms exhibit quantized motion
[9], extended/localized state transitions [10], and Bloch oscillations [11]. To further the connections with condensed
matter and classical optics, the extension of atom optical experiments to quasiperiodic systems seems natural [12–14].
Recently, Guidoni and coworkers [15] trapped cesium atoms into a quasiperiodic optical lattice formed by a three-
dimensional laser conﬁguration with incommensurate spatial components of intensity. Qian Niu and coworkers have
been analyzing such optical lattices in one- and two-dimensions to understand their eigenstructure [16]. We propose
to extend atom lithography and interferometry experiments to create atomic beams or cold trapped atoms with
quasiperiodic center-of-mass wave functions. We present analytical and computational results for the atomic wave
function and density after interaction with a one-dimensional, quasiperiodic atom optical diﬀraction grating. Mo-
mentum distributions reveal the quasiperiodic nature of the wave packets. Furthermore, we show the possibility for
wave packet revivals, essentially a quasiperiodic Talbot eﬀect, where the initial atomic wave function can be (nearly)
recovered.

A schematic of an experiment, similar to typical atomic focusing and Talbot arrangements, is shown in Fig. 1
[5,7]. Two pairs of oﬀ-resonant laser beams of width w intersect at a point along a monoenergetic, transversely-cooled
atomic beam with velocity vz propagating in the z-direction (or alternatively in the y-direction). Assuming the laser
beam pairs are detuned from one another, we can ignore the cross-terms in the intensity pattern. The atoms are
modeled as two-level center-of-mass plane waves with upper-state lifetimes of Γ−1. Hence, this optical conﬁguration
forms a light-shift potential for the atomic ground state,

V (x, z) = V1(z) cos 2kx + V2(z) cos √2kx,

The potential in the interaction region appears as a pulse of duration τ = w/vz in the atomic rest frame. The pulse
shape is determined by the transverse laser proﬁles.

To follow the evolution of the wave packet after the interaction, we can expand the exponentials in Eq. (4) in

superposition of free particle eigenstates exp[ipm,nx/~] with energies Em,n = p2

and Jm is a Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The momentum space wave function superposes a set of regularly

creating a spatial pattern which evolves in time. Thus, the atomic density is not only a quasiperiodic function of the

To detect the density as a function of t, one can scatter a transient probe oﬀ of the atoms at t to record the

More importantly, either direct atomic deposition or lithography using the atomic beam to impinge on a prepared
substrate would reconstruct the atomic density at a ﬁxed time. Atomic lithography has advanced to the point where
atoms can carve nanostructures in materials such as silicon, silicon dioxide, and gold [20]. Such quasiperiodic surfaces
could be used for solid state surface and transport studies. The implications for quantum and optical properties,
including photon localization, may be profound owing to the quasiperiodic boundary conditions for the electron or
optical waves [21].

We now examine two diﬀerent phenomena in the pattern formed by the atoms (8), ignoring dephasing. Semiclassical
(near-ﬁeld) dynamics explain a focusing eﬀect, similar to that seen after periodic phase gratings [5]. In Fig. 2 the
optical potential is shown for A1 = 5 and A2 = 10. Each potential well acts as a lens which can focus atoms
using the impulsive (dipole) force, F (x) = M ∆v(x)/τ =
∂V (x)/∂x, where ∆v(x) is an impulsive velocity kick. To
−
illustrate this eﬀect, V (x) is Taylor expanded around its minimum at x = 0 to give the focusing force near this point,
F (x) = M ∆v(x)/τ
(4V1 + 2V2)kx. Solving for ∆v(x) and setting tf = x/∆v(x), this geometrical argument yields
a focus at the time ωktf = (2A1 + A2)−1 that translates into a spatial distance zf = vztf . The ratio of pulse areas in
Fig. 2, A2/A1 = 2, was chosen so that each standing wave contributes an equal semiclassical force.

≈

7

The density at this ”quasi”-focus with its peak at x = 0 is also shown in Fig. 2. Additional density peaks result
from focusing by the shallower wells which occur at the quasiperiods of the potential. For example, the peak at
2kx
2π occurs near a potential well where the incommensurate standing waves are nearly in phase.
In general, the irrational wave vector ratio, √2 in this case, can be approximated as the ratio as/bs, where as and bs
2πjbs√2 for any
are positive integers without common factors. Quasiperiods will then be deﬁned by 2kx
integer j. A converging sequence Gs which approximates √2 is given in Table 1 [22].

Several peaks in Fig. 2 are labeled by their values of (jas, jbs). For smaller diﬀerences between jas and jbs√2,
2πjas approach the size of the peak at

the quasiperiodicity is more pronounced (i.e., the density peaks near 2kx
x = 0). Thus, the density reﬂects the quasiperiodicity of the system.

The DFT contains the spectral information important for lithography or scattering experiments. In Fig. 3 we plot
[Eq. (9)] at the wave vectors q = 2k(m + n/√2) > 0 and at t = tf for A1 = 5 and
the Fourier amplitudes
A2 = 10 again: this is the DFT of Fig. 2. The major peaks are labeled by (m, n) to show the variation of amplitudes.
The inset of Fig. 3 has the same axes as the main graph and shows the range of q values with signiﬁcant amplitudes.
This Fourier spectrum has qualitative scaling properties: for any Fourier wave vector of the density q0, a wave vector
q′ = 2k(m′ + n′/√2) can be found which is arbitrarily close to q0, even if the amplitude of that component is much
less than one.

Atoms that propagate after interacting with periodic atom optical elements exhibit a self-imaging of their wave
function - Talbot eﬀect - and return to uniform density at times ωkt = 2πj for integer j > 0 [6,7]. While an exact
self-imaging which reproduces φ(x, 0) [Eq. (4)] is impossible owing to the dispersion in Eq. (6), the quasiperiodic
nature of the wave function can lead to a quasi-rephasing when ϕm,n

2πj′ for some integer j′ > 0.

The appropriate observation times for self-imaging will produce phases for each momentum component which are

≃

nearly integer multiples of 2π. For odd values of bs, the choice, ωkts = 4πbs, from Eq. (6) gives the phases

ϕm,n(4πbs) = 2π(2bsm2 + bsn2 + 2bs√2mn),

(11)

where we again refer to Table 1, and bs√2
as by construction. For even values of bs, the rephasing occurs at
ωkts = 2πbs from Eq. (11). At these times the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (11) are integers for all m, n. Furthermore, the
third term is nearly an integer, as required.

≃

The wave function phase θ(x, t) is deﬁned by φ(x, t) =

exp[iθ(x, t)]. For exact self-imaging, the wave
function should be the unitary exponential, Eq. (4), which has density equal to one and phase θ(x, 0) = A1 cos(2kx) +
A2 cos(√2kx).
In Fig. 4 we plot θ(x, ts) for A1 = A2 = 1 and s = 2, 4, and 6. The self-imaging becomes more
pronounced at longer times ts, corresponding to a better approximation of √2 by Gs. The average values (denoted
by the bar) and standard deviations (denoted by σ) of both ρ(x, ts) and the phase diﬀerence, δs = θ(x, ts)
θ(x, 0),
are shown in Table 2 for the cases of Fig. 4.

The improvements in the density and phase are evident as σ(ρ(x, ts)) and σ(δs) converge monotonically to zero as ts
increases. Furthermore, a focusing eﬀect, like the one detailed above, will occur near the times ts + tf since the wave
function at ts is nearly identical to φ(x, 0).

Of course, the ability to perform an experiment on long time scales is severely limited by transverse cooling
considerations. An initial momentum width of ∆px in the atomic beam washes out these coherent eﬀects in a time
(ku)−1, the Doppler dephasing time. This condition does not present a problem for thick lens focusing
t . λM/∆px
and lithography schemes [5,20]. In order to see these thin lens eﬀects, the atom beam must be cooled or collimated
near the recoil limit for focusing (ku . ωk) or below the recoil limit for Talbot self-imaging (ku
ωk). Recent
experiments have conformed with the focusing condition [2,5,23].

In summary, this letter has introduced the possibility of quasiperiodic atom optical elements made from laser inten-
sity gratings with incommensurate wave vectors. The analytical results show that the atomic wave packet becomes a
quasiperiodic function, developing momentum components which are similarly incommensurate and therefore regular,
but not periodic. The atomic density is a function of the time of ﬂight from the diﬀraction grating. Atoms come to
semiclassical ”quasi”-focuses according to the depth and curvature of the potential wells. The quasiperiodic density
pattern can be used to create a quasiperiodic surface for condensed matter studies when used for atomic lithography.
Furthermore, ultracold atoms will exhibit a quasi-self-imaging of the wave function.

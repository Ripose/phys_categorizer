Abstract

We examine the approach to equilibrium of the micromaser. Analytic methods
are ﬁrst used to show that for large times (i.e. many atoms) the convergence is
governed by the next to leading eigenvalue of the corresponding discrete evolution
matrix. The model is then studied numerically. The numerical results conﬁrm
the phase structure expected from analytic approximation methods and agree for
large times with the analysis of Elmfors et al in terms of the “continuous master
equation”. For short times, however, we see evidence for interesting new structure
not previously reported in the literature.

1 Introduction

The micromaser[1] provides an excellent theoretical and experimental testing
ground for many fundamental properties of cavity quantum electrodynamics
and quantum mechanics in general. The physical situation under consider-
ation consists of a superconducting, high Q cavity, that is being traversed
by a low intensity beam of two state atoms. The atoms interact with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in the cavity via an electric dipole interaction. The dy-
namics of the atom cavity system is well described by the Jaynes-Cummings
model[2]. If the cavity transit time τ is short compared to the average time
T between atoms, there is eﬀectively only one atom in the cavity at a time
and the atoms in the beam interact with each other only via their residual
eﬀect on the electromagnetic ﬁeld. For example if the atoms enter the cavity
preferentially in their excited state, and emit a photon, the photons tend
to build up inside the cavity, and each successive atom sees a stronger pho-
ton ﬁeld when it enters the cavity. This “pumping” is responsible for the
evolution of the system into a microwave laser, or “maser”.

Three independent time scales determine the overall dynamical behaviour:
the time interval T between consecutive atoms, τ the time spent by each atom
inside the cavity and 1/γ, the characteristic photon decay time γ inside the
cavity. An important physical quantity is the dimensionless “pumping rate”
N = R/γ, where R = 1/T and γ is the characteristic photon decay time of
the cavity. N can be thought of as the number of atoms that pass through the
cavity in a single photon decay time. When both damping and pumping are
present, the photon distribution inside the cavity asymptotically approaches
a steady state distribution. The details of the steady state (equilibrium)
distribution depend on the time τ that the atom spends in the cavity as well
as the dimensionless pumping rate N.

Although much work has been done on the equilibrium properties of this
system, to the best of our knowledge there has not been a systematic anal-
ysis of the initial stages of the approach to equilibrium, which in principle
can be important in determining the outcome of very low ﬂux experiments.
The purpose of the present work is to examine numerically this approach to
equilibrium. In particular, we will see how varying the physical parameters
aﬀects the rate at which equilibrium is reached: i.e. how many atoms must
pass through the cavity before a steady state photon distribution is estab-
lished. In a recent paper, Elmfors et al[3] looked at long time correlations
in the outgoing atomic beam and their relation to the various phases of the

1

micromaser system. The properties they considered were associated with
the equilibrium conﬁguration of the cavity photon distribution, but there is
a close connection between the correlation functions considered in [3] and
the near equilibrium dynamical behaviour that we will be examining. As we
will show, our results agree with those of [3] in the appropriate (i.e large N)
limits.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we review the JC model
and its application to the physical situation at hand. In particular we de-
rive transition matrix S that governs the master equation for the dynamical
evolution of the photon distribution inside the cavity. We also derive the
expression for the probability P (+) of ﬁnding the atom in the excited state.
In Section 3 we show that the approach to equilibrium of the photon dis-
tribution and of the physically measured P (+) is governed by the leading
eigenvalues of S. We compare our theoretical analysis to that of Elmfors
et al, who looked at correlation functions instead of the photon distribution
directly. In Section 4, we describe the numerical experiment that we use to
analyze the approach to equilibrium, and compare our results to our theoret-
ical analysis and to that of Elmfors et al. Section 5 closes with a summary
and conclusions.

2 The Jaynes-Cummings Model

We consider atoms with two possible states

E− = ¯hωa

ωa = ωc = ω

For a high Q cavity, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is well approximated by a single
mode, with energy Ec = ¯hωc. For simplicity we assume that the cavity is
tuned so that its fundamental frequency is equal to that of the atom:

For a single atom traversing the cavity, the dynamics of the atom-cavity
system is governed by the JC Hamiltonian.

H = ωa†a +

ωσz + g(aσ+ + a†σ−)

where g is the coupling constant, a† (a) are the photon creation (annihilation)

The above analysis assumes that the system under consideration is in
a pure quantum state. In a realistic experiment both the atom and cavity
would be described by a density matrix representing a mixed state. We will
now show that under some simple assumptions the above formulas also apply
to the more realistic case. Let ˆρ(t)aC denote the density matrix describing
the atom/cavity system at time t. Operator expectation values are given by,

ˆ
Oi

h

= TraC(ˆρ(t)aC ˆ
O

)

where the subscript aC indicates that the trace is over both the atomic and
the cavity states. If we restrict ourselves to the measurement of observables
that involve only atomic operators, the expectation value of such an operator
is given by,

(t)

ˆ

where the operator

h

ˆρ(t)red = TrC ˆρ(t)

is the trace over the cavity states of the total density matrix and is called the
reduced density matrix of the system. To determine the expectation values
of atomic operators at arbitrary times we need to know ρ(t)red for any time
t.

Our system consists of a series of atoms that enter a cavity containing
electromagnetic radiation. We require that the time T between atoms, and
the photon decay time 1/γ, are much larger than the time that any given
atom spends in the cavity (T
τ ); equivalently we assume that
the time scale of interactions within the reservoir is much smaller than the
time scale over which we want to consider the evolution of the system. Under
this condition the density matrix for the initial state of the system can be
factored into a product of density matrices for the cavity and the individual
atoms:

states to obtain the ensemble averaged density matrix,

To study the time evolution of the atomic variables, we need the time depen-
dent reduced density matrix at time t. A straightforward calculation reveals
that

Ps(t) given in Eq.(10) and Eq.(11). Similarly, if we are interested in
with
measuring only cavity observables, we must consider the reduced density
matrix for the cavity, which after time, t is given by:

where Pn(t) is given by Eq.(13). Thus if the initial atomic and cavity density
matrices are diagonal, then they both remain diagonal, and they give rise to
precisely the same master equation for the photon probability distribution
as in the case of pure states.

Eq.(14) can be modiﬁed to include the eﬀects of thermal damping. Sup-
pose the photon distribution inside the cavity initially is p(0). An atom enters
the cavity and exits after an interaction time τ . Assuming that γτ
1, we
neglect damping during the atom-photon interaction. The probability distri-
bution for the photons just before the next atom enters the cavity is[3]:

≪

p(T ) = e−γLC T M(τ )p(0)

(25)

where T is the time between atoms and

(n + 1)δn+1,m) + nb((n + 1)δn,m −

(LC)nm = (nb + 1)(nδn,m −
We can also take into account the fact that atoms in the beam arrive at time
intervals that are Poisson distributed, with an average time interval of T =
1/R between them. Multiplying by the distribution function exp(
RT ) RT
and integrating we ﬁnd the averaged photon distribution just prior to the
arrival of the second atom to be:

(27)

(28)

This is the form of the master equation that we will use to describe the
dynamics of the photon distribution inside the cavity. We will refer to it as
the discrete master equation.

The analysis in [3] starts from a diﬀerent master equation, which is called
the continuous master equation. To derive the continuous master equation,
Elmfors et al consider a situation where the ﬂux of incoming atoms is large
enough that the atoms have Poisson distributed arrival times, so that each
atom has the same probability Rd t of arriving in an inﬁnitesimal time d t.
They further assume that the interaction within the cavity takes place in
a time much less than this time interval (τ
d t) which means that the
interaction is essentially instantaneous. The contributions from damping
and pumping during the time interval d t can then be considered separately.

≪

The contribution from the damping is exactly the same as before [Eq.(26)].
The contribution from pumping has the form,

(dp)pump = (M

1)Rpd t

−

where M is given in Eq.(14) as before. The continuous form of the master
equation is obtained by combining the two contributions,

γLCp + (M

It is expected that the continuous and discrete master equations agree when
the number of atoms per photon decay time is very large.2. In particular,
when the thermalization time scale 1/γ is much greater than the time T
between atoms, the large time (many atom) dynamics should agree. This
correspondence will be veriﬁed explicitly below.

3 Eigenvalue Problem and Approach to Equi-

librium

Recall the physical system we are considering. We inject a series of atoms
into a cavity. The time, T , between the atoms is much greater than the
time an individual atom takes to pass through the cavity τ so that there
is never more than one atom in the cavity at one time. Each atom inter-
acts with the cavity’s electromagnetic ﬁeld as it passes through the cavity,
and consequently, the photon distribution changes repeatedly. According to
the discrete master equation Eq.(27) after k atoms have passed through the
cavity, the photon distribution, p(k) is:

p(k) = Skp(0),

(32)

where p(0) is the initial photon distribution. Equilibrium occurs when the
photon distribution is no longer changed by the transition matrix S. That is

(33)
2Note that the atomic ﬂux must still be small enough so that eﬀectively only one atom

Speq = peq

is in the cavity at a time.

8

and the equilibrium photon distribution peq is an eigenvector of S with eigen-
peq, and it is precisely this
value 1. We expect that as k
approach to equilibrium that we wish to investigate.

, p(k)

→

As discussed in [3] the approach to equilibrium is governed by the eigen-
values of S. Before proving this, we need some preliminaries. The right
eigenvectors of the matrix S [Eq.(28)] are written p(l), the left eigenvectors
are uT (l) and the eigenvalues are κ(l),

Sp(l) = κ(l)p(l)
uT (l)S = uT (l)κ(l)

Eq.(33) implies that there is an eigenvector with eigenvalue unity. As we will
see, all other eigenvalues must be less than one in order for the system to be
stable. For convenience, we label the eigenvalues by size;

With this labelling, p(1)

peq and

≡

κ(1) = 1 > κ(2) > κ(3)....

Sp(1) = p(1)
uT (1)S = uT (1)

From Eq.(14), Eq.(26) and Eq.(28) it follows that uT (1) is a vector with all
components equal to one. To see this, note that the transformation matrix S
must preserve the norm of the probability distribution. It therefore follows
that

for all pn, which in turn requires:

Snmpm =

for all m. This is equivalent to Eq.(38) with uT (1)

n = 1.

We will use the fact that the similarity transform of the form

diagonalizes the matrix S and that the inverse of T is given by the left
eigenvector:

lm Tma = δla

Snm = Σ∞

l=1κ(l)p(l)

It is easy to verify that this expression satisﬁes the eigenvector equations
Eq.(34) and Eq.(35).

In order to investigate the approach to equilibrium we start with the fact

that

Now deﬁne

dp(k) = p(k + 1)

p(k) = (S

where dk = (k + 1)
k = 1. This is the discrete version of the continuous
evolution equation Eq.(30). In the limit of large k, it can be treated as a
diﬀerential equation. In order to integrate it, we ﬁrst deﬁne

Q(k) = T −1p(k)

Eq.(48) can be trivially integrated to give

eracy in the next to leading eigenvalues. As we will see in the subsequent
numerical analysis, interesting things occur when κ(2) and κ(3) are close within
the numerical accuracy of the calculation.

Note that the continuous master equation Eq.(30) can be integrated in
γL, so that the asymp-
precisely the same way, with

κ(l).

Note that the above expectation values have assumed that the photon distri-
bution is already at its equilibrium value p(1)
n before the spin of the ﬁrst atom
is measured. In spite of this, the correlation function Eq.(55) does describe
the approach to equilibrium and is directly related to the quantities that we
study in the present paper. In particular, the correlation length associated
with γk approaches zero in the limit of large k, and this approach is gov-
erned by the same eigenvalues as the approach to equilibrium of the photon
distribution. The basic argument is as follows. In eﬀect
ik depends on
the conditional probability that one ﬁrst measures the spin to be s1, say and
that after k atoms pass, spin s2 is measured. However, when one measures
the ﬁrst spin, one eﬀectively applies a projection operator which moves the
photon distribution away from the equilibrium conﬁguration. The shape of
this projected photon distribution then determines the correlation between
the ﬁrst and second spin measurements. One expects that for a very large
number k of atoms between the two measurements, the photon distribution
again approaches its equilibrium value, so that correlation between the two
spin measurement vanishes. That is:

and the correlation function approaches zero as k approaches inﬁnity. The
correlations between well separated atoms therefore measure the rate at
which the photon distribution settles back to equilibrium.

4 Numerical Results

We wish to investigate numerically the approach to equilibrium of the photon
distribution as described by the dynamical master equation Eq.(32), with S
given by Eq.(28). We assume for concreteness that before the ﬁrst atom
enters the cavity, the photons are in thermal equilibrium at the tempera-
ture T which characterizes the thermal properties of the system throughout
the experiment. In principle the asymptotic properties of the approach to
equilibrium should not be sensitive to the initial photon distribution, but
we observed some interesting short time behaviour which presumably does
depend on the initial distribution. The short time behaviour may thus have
physical relevance. To begin, we start with the photon distribution:

The mean photon number is therefore

Note that the mean photon number also plays an important role in the master
equation, i.e. in the matrix LC (Eq.(26)) that determines the rate at which
the photon distribution relaxes into thermal equilibrium. For a typical two

As shown in Section 3 above, the asymptotic behaviour of the approach
to equilibrium and the long time correlation functions are both determined
by the leading eigenvalues of the matrix S. Fig. 1 shows how the correlation
length Eq.(70) changes, for nb = 3, with pumping rate and interaction time
3. The axes correspond to the pumping rate N and θ = gτ √N , which is a
scaled time parameter that is useful in revealing the phase structure. One
can readily see the evidence for critical points at θ
4.6, which
mark the transition from the thermal phase to the maser phase and from
the thermal phase to the ﬁrst critical phase, respectively. As anticipated the
phase structure matches the one obtained by [3] using the continuous master
equation.

In the present work, we implement Eq.(32) directly by doing the numerical
“experiment” of sending in one atom after another (i.e. multiplying p by
S), and seeing how the photon distribution changes with k, the number of
atoms that have passed through the cavity. The purpose of the numerical
experiment was to measure how long it takes to get to equilibrium for diﬀerent
4. This could be important in
values of the physical parameters N and nb
physical experiments in which the results are interpreted in terms of the
equilibrium photon distribution. In general we found that convergence was
very rapid, with some interesting anomalies in the short time behaviour 5.

3In order to calculate the eigenvalues we truncated the photon number at n = 200, so

that S was a 200

200 matrix.

4In the subsequent analysis gτ is kept ﬁxed, which is relevant experimentally. The

×

eﬀect of varying gτ will be examined in future work.

5Short “time” here actually refers to the ﬁrst few atoms in the iteration.

15

In order to deal with ﬁnite dimensional matrices, we need to truncate
the photon distribution at n = nmax, say. Consistency requires that the
probability of having nmax photons in the cavity be small compared to the
numerical accuracy of the calculation. This was checked by calculating the
normalization of the probability distribution after each iteration. We found
that the slight error in the normalization grew geometrically with the number
of iterations, which was problematic for runs that contained thousands of
atoms. We found however that this behaviour could be corrected by simply
re-normalizing p(k) at each iteration. If this was done, the errors grew only
linearly with k, and nmax of about 200 was suﬃciently large for our purposes.
The purpose of the numerical experiment was to measure how long it takes
to reach equilibrium for diﬀerent values of the physical parameters gτ , N and
nb. This could be important in physical experiments in which the results
are interpreted in terms of the equilibrium photon distribution. In general
we found that convergence was very rapid. In order to have a quantitative
measure of “how close” the system is to equilibrium, it is necessary to deﬁne a
suitable measure on the space of photon distributions, which for the present
purposes could be thought of as an nmax dimensional vector space. We
therefore deﬁne the distance between the photon distribution after k atoms
and the equilibrium distribution by:

and take as a test for convergence the condition that all pn(k) must be within
a certain range of the equilibrium value:

∆pn(k) =

pn(k)

|

pequilib

|

−

max ∆pn(k) < 0.005

In order to have a point of comparison, we also checked convergence with a
diﬀerent measure, namely:

P+(k) =

(equil) are the probability for an atom entering emerging
P+(k) and
where
from the cavity in the excited state for photon distributions during the transit
given by pn(k) and peq
n , respectively. (cf. Eq.(10).) We then used as a second
test for convergence

This test compares the probability that the kth atom will emerge in the
excited state to the same probability at equilibrium. It therefore has direct
physical relevance. Figs. 2a) and 2b) plot ∆p(k) and ∆P+(k) as functions
of k for N = 45, nb = 3.0 and τ = 1.0. It is interesting that the system ﬁrst
P+(k)) and then moves away
moves towards equilibrium (very rapidly for ∆
from equilibrium before it settles into its exponential approach to equilibrium.
This feature appears to be fairly generic for large N.

In order to do a systematic analysis of the convergence rate as a function
of the physical parameters, we deﬁne kmax as the number of atoms it takes
for ∆p(k) to get to some critical value, ∆crit, or less. For small enough ∆crit,
kmax should be large, in which case the convergence will be determined by
the next to leading eigenvalue of S. Fig. 3 plots kmax as obtained from the
two tests as functions of θ and N for nb = 3, with the condition ∆crit = 0.005.
Clearly the resulting values of kmax are large enough to be in the region of
asymptotic convergence and the phase structure is the same as that predicted
analytically using the eigenvalues of S. This result conﬁrms the validity of
our numerical method.

We now use the numerical experiments to investigate a diﬀerent but re-
lated property of convergence. In particular, we look at how kmax is aﬀected
by a change in nb and N for ﬁxed interaction time. As shown in Fig. 4, as nb
gets large, the convergence is uniformly rapid for all N, whereas for low nb
(i.e. low temperatures) there are critical values of N for which convergence
slows suddenly. These are presumably the same transitions as in Fig. 1 but
seen from a diﬀerent view. In particular, lines of ﬁxed nb and gτ correspond
to a section of Fig. 1 with θ = gτ √N. Fig. 5 shows this structure for ﬁxed
nb and gτ . As shown in Fig. 6, these “steps” in the convergence coincide (at
least approximately) with values of the parameters in which the correlation
length, as determined by the leading eigenvalue, increases. Fig. 6 plots the
correlation lengths for nb = 1 for the ﬁrst four leading eigenvalues. It is in-
teresting that the “steps” correspond to points where the eigenvalues appear
to cross. However, the eigenvalues are not degenerate [3], so the curves do
not actually intersect.
In Fig. 7 the equilibrium photon distributions are
plotted for nb = 1 as a function of N. It shows clearly that the “crossing”
of the eigenvalues is related to a discrete shift in the peak of the equilibrium
photon distribution. The crossings, and the associated transitions in the
convergence rate illustrated in Fig. 5, occur when the photon distribution is
in the process of shifting, i.e. where there are two peaks.

5 Conclusions

We have presented a systematic analysis of the discrete master equation de-
scribing the approach to equilibrium of the micromaser in the presence of
thermal dissipation. As expected, the long time behaviour is determined by
the leading eigenvalues of the discrete transformation matrix. Interestingly,
the eigenvalues of the matrix, evaluated numerically, become at some places
nearly degenerate, and the phase structure of the micromaser occurs at or
near where the eigenvalues come close to crossing. Our analytic results con-
ﬁrm general features that emerge from the continuous master equation in [3].
We also have examined the approach to equilibrium of the micromaser both
at short and long times using numerically methods. Our numerical results
are consistent with the behaviour expected from the leading eigenvalues of
both the discrete and continuous transformation matrices. However, our re-
sults also show some interesting feature for short times; in particular, the
system in general ﬁrst approaches equilibrium relatively rapidly, then moves
away from equilibrium, and then ﬁnally settles into its exponential approach
to equilibrium. This behaviour appears to be fairly generic for large values
of N, but more analysis is required to determine the source and relevance of
these short time features. Moreover we have, in the numerical experiments,
kept the transit time ﬁxed. In future work we hope to examine how varying
gτ aﬀects the above mentioned features.

Appendix: The Relationship Between the Continuous and Dis-

crete Cases

We expect diﬀerences in the dynamical behaviour in the discrete and
continuous formalisms, but there should exist a limit in which the two for-
malisms coincide. We look at the discrete formalism in the large ﬂux limit.
We take k = Rt to be large, which means that t
1/T , or that the to-
tal time over which the system is observed is much greater than the time
between individual atoms.

To take the large ﬂux limit of the discrete master equation, we follow the

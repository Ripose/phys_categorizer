this regime a splitting of the FM NMOR resonance due to the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect is observed.
At suﬃciently high light intensities, there is also a splitting of the FM NMOR resonances due to ac
Stark shifts induced by the optical ﬁeld, as well as evidence of alignment-to-orientation conversion
type processes. The consequences of these eﬀects for FM-NMOR-based atomic magnetometry in
the geophysical ﬁeld range are considered.

INTRODUCTION

Sensitive magnetometers are essential tools in many
areas of research, ranging from biology and medicine
[1, 2, 3] to geophysics [4, 5] to tests of fundamen-
tal symmetries [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Over the past
few decades, magnetometers based on superconducting
quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) have been the
most sensitive magnetic ﬁeld sensors [12].
In recent
years, however, signiﬁcant technical advances have en-
abled atomic magnetometers to achieve sensitivities ri-
valing [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and even surpassing [19]
that of most SQUID-based magnetometers. Atomic mag-
netometers have the intrinsic advantage of not requir-
ing cryogenic cooling, and eﬃcient methods for micro-
fabrication of atomic magnetometers (with dimensions
1 mm) have recently been developed [20, 21]. Thus
∼
atomic magnetometers oﬀer the possibility of compact,
aﬀordable, and portable ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors.
The atomic magnetometer with the best short-term
sensitivity is the spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF)
magnetometer whose magnetometric sensitivity exceeds

principle [19]. However, the SERF magnetometer can
only achieve optimum sensitivity at ﬁelds (<
1 mG)
∼
because it requires the spin-exchange rate to be much
greater than the Larmor precession frequency. Although
operation of a SERF magnetometer in an unshielded en-
vironment has been demonstrated [22] by using a feed-
back system with three orthogonal Helmholtz coils to
null the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, it operated far from the
limit of sensitivity due to imperfect cancelation of mag-
10−8 G/√Hz).

tation (NMOR) [24] related to long-lived (τ rel

In order to translate the magnetometric sensitivity of
NMOR in paraﬃn-coated cells to magnetic ﬁelds where

light,
Linearly polarized,
is
propagating in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld,
used for optical pumping and probing of the ground
state atomic polarization. The linearly polarized light,
which can be represented as a coherent superposition of
left- and right-circularly polarized light, establishes co-
herences between Zeeman sublevels (Fig. 1). Since in
this work the diameter of the laser beam (
4 mm) is
much smaller than the vapor cell diameter of 3 cm, the
atoms that have interacted with the light subsequently

≈

leave the laser beam path and bounce around the cell
thousands of times on average before returning to the
light beam in the appropriate velocity group. The ener-
gies of the Zeeman sublevels are shifted by the magnetic
and optical electric ﬁeld [see Sec. IV] causing the rela-
tive phase between the component states of the coherent
superposition to evolve according to the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (quantum beats). A subsequent
light-atom interaction, once the relative phase between
the Zeeman sublevels has evolved, can cause a rotation
of the plane of polarization of the light ﬁeld (see recent
reviews [24, 29]).

Since the laser light is frequency modulated, the op-
tical pumping and probing acquire a periodic time de-
pendence. When the pumping rate is synchronized with
the precession of atomic polarization, a resonance occurs
and the atomic medium is pumped into a polarized state
which rotates around the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
(synchronous optical pumping [30]). Consequently, the
optical properties of the medium are modulated at the
quantum-beat frequency, leading to modulation of the
angle of the light polarization. If the time-dependent op-
tical rotation is measured at the ﬁrst harmonic of the
modulation frequency Ωm, ultra-narrow resonances are
observed at near-zero magnetic ﬁelds, and at ﬁelds where
the modulation frequency Ωm is a subharmonic of one of
the quantum-beat frequencies of the system [18, 23, 31].
It should be noted that this technique yields a scalar mag-
netometer: the precession frequency is dependent only
on the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld and not its di-
rection. For light propagation that is not collinear with
the magnetic ﬁeld, broad, asymmetric resonances are ob-
served at the same frequency as for propagation parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld. At low magnetic ﬁelds and low
light power, the quantum-beat frequency for a coherence
between two ground-state sublevels diﬀering in magnetic
quantum number by ∆MF is ∆MF ΩL = ∆MF gF µBB,
where gF is the Land´e factor for a particular hyperﬁne
component. Here we specialize to the 2S1/2 ground state
of the alkali atoms, for which, neglecting the nuclear mag-
netic moment, gF =
1/2,
2 is the Land´e factor for the electron and
where gs ≈
I is the nuclear spin. In the range of geophysical ﬁelds
and high light powers there are small corrections to the
quantum-beat frequency, as discussed in Sec. IV.
In
the present work we concentrate on the signals obtained
2ΩL. Such signals are dominated by the pre-
when Ωm ≈
cession of the quadrupole moment (atomic alignment) as-
sociated with ∆MF = 2 coherences, see Refs. [24, 31, 32].
Higher order multipole moments were studied in Refs.
[31] and [33].

In-
side the innermost shield layer is a set of seven coils that
control the dc magnetic ﬁelds (Bx, By, Bz) and ﬁrst-
order gradients (∂Bx/∂x, ∂By/∂y, ∂Bz/∂z), as well as
the second-order gradient ∂2Bx/∂x2 along the direction
of light propagation (x) in which the largest ﬁeld is ap-
plied. The Bx, By, and Bz coils are rectangular in shape,
matching the shape of the innermost shielding layer so
that image currents in the shields make the coils appear
inﬁnitely long, yielding a ﬁeld uniform to about a part in
104 over the region of the cell. The eﬀect of magnetic-ﬁeld
gradients is reduced due to motional averaging because
in the evacuated paraﬃn-coated cells the atoms bounce
oﬀ the walls, traversing the cell many times between the
pump and probe interactions. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that
residual gradients contribute to broadening of the FM
NMOR resonance at a level comparable to the eﬀects of
power broadening over the range of magnetic ﬁelds stud-
ied here.

IV. SPLITTING OF THE FM NMOR

RESONANCE: NONLINEAR ZEEMAN EFFECT
AND AC STARK SHIFTS

The upper traces in Fig. 3 show the dependence of
the amplitude of the time-dependent optical rotation
signal on modulation frequency in the vicinity of the
Ωm = 2ΩL resonance for Bx = 405 mG. Solid symbols
represent the component in-phase with the light modu-
lation, hollow symbols represent the component out-of-
phase (quadrature) with the light modulation. At the
low magnetic ﬁelds investigated in previous FM NMOR
studies [18, 23, 31], a single, unsplit, dispersive (absorp-
tive) feature was seen in the in-phase (quadrature) com-
ponent. These data demonstrate that in the geophysical
ﬁeld range, the FM NMOR signals for 87Rb take on a
more complicated shape, the result of three separate res-
onances corresponding to the three ∆MF = 2 Zeeman co-
herences created in the F = 2 ground state (Fig. 1). The
quantum beat frequency associated with each of these
coherences has been shifted slightly due to the combined
action of the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect (mixing of diﬀer-
ent ground hyperﬁne states by the magnetic ﬁeld) and

atomic resonance (∆ < 0) interacts with three separate co-
herent superpositions of ground state Zeeman sublevels with
∆MF = 2. Dashed bars indicate the energies of the Zeeman
sublevels shifted by the magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 1). The solid

dipole moments (indicated by the thickness of the transition
arrows and the numerical values next to them), the Zeeman
sublevels are shifted by diﬀerent amounts. Thus the ac Stark

with the ground state by the optical electric ﬁeld). Over-
laying the in-phase (quadrature) data in Fig. 3 is a ﬁt to
a sum of three dispersive (absorptive) Lorentzians. The
lower traces in Fig. 3 show the in-phase component of
each resonance separately.

We ﬁrst consider the low light power limit where the
shift in resonance frequencies of the three coherences is
primarily due to the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect. Neglecting
the contribution of the nuclear magnetic moment to the
Zeeman eﬀect, in suﬃciently weak magnetic ﬁelds (where
∆HF and ∆HF is the energy separation between
ΩL ≪
the hyperﬁne levels) the energy E(F, MF ) of a particu-
lar ground-state Zeeman sublevel of an alkali atom with
nuclear spin I = 3/2 is approximately given by a per-
turbative expansion of the Breit-Rabi formula (see, for
example, Ref. [36]):

We now turn to the discussion of the diﬀerential ac
Stark shift, shown schematically in Fig. 4. This eﬀect
arises because of 1) diﬀering strengths of the transition
dipole moments from various F = 2 ground state sub-
levels to the F ′ = 1 excited state, and 2) diﬀerences in
optical detuning for the diﬀerent hyperﬁne ground states
due to the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the ground state
energy levels. A complete treatment of the ac Stark shifts
necessitates a density matrix calculation to account for
optical pumping and the subsequent magnetic ﬁeld in-
duced evolution into and out of bright and dark states,
and is complicated by Doppler broadening, the modula-
tion of the light frequency and the fact that the atoms
bounce into and out of the light. However, some insight
can be gained from a heuristic approach, ignoring these
issues and the fact that all laser-induced transitions are
coupled.
In this case the ac Stark shift of a two level
system is well approximated by

δMF =

d2
MF E2

∆
∆2 + Γ2/4

(3)

where dMF is the relevant dipole matrix element, E is the
optical electric ﬁeld, ∆ = ∆0 + MF ΩL is the detuning
from optical resonance and Γ is the optical linewidth. Ne-
glecting the magnetic-ﬁeld induced dependence of the de-
tuning on the magnetic quantum number MF , the shift of
the ground state depends only on the strength of the rel-
evant dipole matrix element so that δMF = δ−MF . How-
ever, in the Earth ﬁeld range, the diﬀerence in detuning
of the ground state energy levels is signiﬁcant compared
to the natural linewidth, yielding an asymmetry in the
shifts δ±MF .

Including both the ac Stark shift and the nonlinear
Zeeman eﬀect, the resonance frequencies for the three
diﬀerent ∆MF = 2 coherences are given by

the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect. For detuning to the high

diﬀerential ac Stark shift reverses, indicating that it is
primarily oﬀ-resonant interaction with the F ′ = 1 ex-

A density matrix calculation of FM NMOR on a F =
F ′ = 1 transition for atoms in an uncoated cell

(where evolution in the dark can be ignored), neglect-
ing Doppler-broadening, reproduces the salient features
of the experimental data. This numerical calculation
extends our previous analytic calculation [23] to arbi-
trary light intensities and angular momenta using the
method of Ref. [37]. The Hamiltonian for the modulated
light-ﬁeld interaction and the linear and quadratic Zee-
man shifts is written under the rotating-wave approxima-
tion, neglecting terms counter-rotating at the optical fre-
quency. The density-matrix evolution equations are then
formed, including terms describing spontaneous decay of
the upper state at a rate γ0, and atoms entering and leav-
ing the interaction region (transit relaxation) at a rate γt.
The equations are solved for the Fourier components of
the density matrix using the matrix-continued-fraction
method: a recursion relation for the Fourier components
is inverted as a continued fraction that can be evaluated
to any desired accuracy by truncation (to be described in
detail in a future publication). The resulting optical rota-

V. LIGHT-POWER DEPENDENCE OF FM
NMOR RESONANCE AMPLITUDE

The top and bottom panels of Fig. 7 show the width
and amplitude, respectively, of the in-phase component of
the central FM NMOR resonance as a function of light
power for several magnetic ﬁelds. In order to compare
with earlier work [38], the width here is deﬁned by the
distance from the center of the dispersive resonance as a
function of Ωm to the maximum of the rotation angle [39].
The amplitude of the central resonance reaches a maxi-
mum of about 0.5 mrad at approximately 150 µW, inde-
pendent of magnetic ﬁeld. In addition to power broaden-
ing, there appears to be an extra source of relaxation that
increases with magnetic ﬁeld. We attribute this eﬀect to
high order magnetic ﬁeld gradients for which we can-
not compensate with the current experimental setup. At
100 mG, by careful zeroing of ﬁrst
lower magnetic ﬁelds
order magnetic ﬁeld gradients, it was possible to achieve
widths extrapolated to zero power consistent with the
best obtained with this cell at 0.15 mG corresponding to
3.5 Hz [38]. Finally, we note that the satellite resonances
experience slightly greater light broadening than the cen-
tral resonance due to diﬀerent strengths of the transition
dipole moments. First order perturbation theory predicts
a ratio of 3:4 between the width of the central resonance

≈

and width of the satellite resonances, in agreement with
our measurements.

VI. ALIGNMENT-TO-ORIENTATION
CONVERSION (AOC)

In the presence of both the magnetic ﬁeld and the ac
Stark shift due to the optical electric ﬁeld, the atomic
alignment induced by optical pumping can be converted
to an orientation (dipole moment) parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld, a process known as alignment-to-orientation
conversion (AOC) [21, 40]. A static orientation along
the magnetic ﬁeld leads to optical rotation via circular
birefringence which is maximal when the light is tuned
to resonance. Thus as the light frequency is periodically
tuned closer and further from the resonance, the ampli-
tude of rotation due to the static orientation increases
and decreases in phase with the light frequency modula-
tion. To illustrate the eﬀect of AOC, we plot the ratio
of the amplitude of the in-phase and quadrature compo-
nents as a function of light power in Fig. 8 for modulation
depths of 40 MHz and 120 MHz. For a modulation depth
of 40 MHz (circles and triangles), we ﬁnd that the am-
plitude of the quadrature component decreases relative
to the in-phase component as the light power increases,
independent of the magnetic ﬁeld, indicating the pres-
ence of alignment-to-orientation conversion. This eﬀect
is reduced dramatically for data taken with a modula-
tion depth of 120 MHz, consistent with results presented
in Ref. [21]. The simplest explanation for this behavior
is that at higher modulation depths, the light ﬁeld is,
on average, further from resonance, leading to smaller ac
Stark shifts. However, the observed ac Stark shifts were
similar for data sets with both large and small modu-
lation depths. Further work will be necessary to fully
understand AOC with frequency modulated light.

This falls somewhat short of the sensitivity estimate of
10−11 G/√Hz [18] derived from measurements performed
at roughly 1 mG. The largest factor contributing to the
reduced sensitivity is the use of a 3 cm diameter cell
rather than a 10 cm cell which yielded a larger opti-
cal depth and FM NMOR resonance widths of about
1 Hz. Additional contributions to the higher sensitivity
[18] come from the fact that the split-
reported in Ref.
ting of the FM NMOR resonance was much less than its
width. Hence three diﬀerent ∆MF = 2 coherences con-
tributed to the slope of the optical rotation signal as a
function of magnetic ﬁeld. While there is little that can
be done about the separation of the resonance frequen-
cies for a given atom at high magnetic ﬁeld, we anticipate
considerable improvement with further optimization of
parameters such as light power, modulation depth, de-

tuning of the central optical frequency, cell size and tem-
perature. Unfortunately, environmental magnetic noise
(the current sources used to generate the magnetic ﬁeld
are only stable to about a part in 106) prevents a demon-
stration of sensitivity in the Earth-ﬁeld range beyond the
level of about 1µG/√Hz.

We now brieﬂy address the issue of the shift of the cen-
tral resonance due to the magnetic-ﬁeld induced asym-
metry in optical detuning. We ﬁrst make the assump-
tion that we are detuned to the low frequency side of
the optical resonance by more than one linewidth, and
that 4ΩL is much less than the optical linewidth. Un-
der these conditions δ2
δ−1) because the
δ−2
relevant transition dipole matrix elements diﬀer by a fac-
tor of √2 (see Fig. 4) and the diﬀerence in detuning be-
2 sublevels is twice as great as for the
tween the MF =
1 sublevels. Making use of this fact we see that
MF =
δup
δ−1). Hence the central resonance is
shifted from 2ΩL by only 10 Hz out of 700 kHz at the
highest magnetic ﬁeld and light power in this work. In
principle, it should be possible to account for this in a
practical device.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

(7)

(8)

We have performed an experimental

investigation
of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with frequency-
modulated light (FM NMOR) resonances in the geophys-
ical ﬁeld range. We have observed a splitting of the usual
quadrupole FM NMOR resonance into three distinct res-
onances by the nonlinear Zeeman eﬀect as well as by the
ac Stark shift. Our measurements of the nonlinear Zee-
man eﬀect are in good agreement with theoretical predic-
tions. The combined eﬀects of the ac Stark shift and the
linear Zeeman eﬀect lead to an asymmetry in the splitting
of the FM NMOR resonance. Evidence for alignment-to-
orientation conversion has been presented. Finally, based
on the measurements described here, we estimate a sensi-
tivity to magnetic ﬁelds based on FM NMOR resonances
10−10 G/√Hz and we anticipate signiﬁcant im-
of
provement with further optimization.

[39] In work reported in Ref. [38], the magnetic ﬁeld, rather
than the modulation frequency, was scanned and the
width was deﬁned by gsµB/(2I + 1)∆B where ∆B was
the distance between the extrema of the dispersive res-
onance. In this work we scan the modulation frequency
and the resonance occurs at, Ωm = 2gsµB/(2I + 1)B,
and hence we quote the distance from the center to the
maximum of the dispersive signal as a function of Ωm.

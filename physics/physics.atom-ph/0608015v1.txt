(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The interaction of relativistically strong tailored laser pulses with an atomic system is considered.
Due to a special tailoring of the laser pulse, the suppression of the relativistic drift of the ionized
electron and a dramatic enhancement of the rescattering probability is shown to be achievable. The
high harmonic generation rate in the relativistic regime is calculated and shown to be increased by
several orders of magnitude compared to the case of conventional laser pulses. The energies of the
revisiting electron at the atomic core can approach the MeV domain, thus rendering hard x-ray
harmonics and nuclear reactions with single atoms feasible.

PACS numbers: 42.65.Ky, 32.80.Gc, 32.80.Rm

In intense laser-atom interaction phenomena the
rescattering concept plays a central role [1]. Here the
electron is ionized, propagated in the continuum by
the laser ﬁeld, and ﬁnally driven back and scattered at
the ionic core in the case of above-threshold ionization
(ATI)[2], ionizing further bound electrons in the case of
non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) [3], or recom-
bining with the ionic core with high-harmonic genera-
tion (HHG) [4].
It is highly desirable to increase the
rescattering electron energy [5] as it can be employed
to generate higher harmonics [6], to image attosecond
dynamics of nuclear processes [7], or to initiate nuclear
reactions with a single atom/molecule [8, 9]. The elec-
tron energy increase can not be achieved by a straight-
forward increase of the laser intensity. When the laser in-
tensity approaches the relativistic regime, the laser mag-
netic ﬁeld eﬀect starts to play a role by inducing a drift
of the ionized electron in the laser propagation direction
which severely suppresses the probability of the electron
revisiting the ionic core. There are several attempts to
circumvent this eﬀect in order to increase the eﬃciency
of rescattering, particularly, using relativistic ions which
propagate in laser propagation direction [6, 8], or us-
ing two counter-propagating laser beams with linear [10]
or equally handed circular polarization [7], or generating
harmonics via exotic positronium atoms in strong laser
ﬁelds [11]. On a diﬀerent front, new techniques for gener-
ating attosecond pulses have recently emerged based on
HHG in gases [12, 13] and in plasmas interaction [14, 15].
The usage of attosecond pulse trains (APT’s) to enhance
HHG in a strong laser ﬁeld has been shown in [16].

In this letter we show how eﬃcient recollisions in the
relativistic regime are feasible by employing specially tai-
lored strong laser pulses in the form of APT’s (see Fig.1).
As an indicator of strong ﬁeld recollision phenomena we
consider the HHG process from an ion in a relativistically
strong tailored laser pulse (see Fig.2). While in [16] the
weak APT serves to solely control the initial conditions of
the ionized electron in the strong laser ﬁeld, we consider

FIG. 1: By using optimized tailored pulses in the form of an
APT instead of conventional sinusoidal pulses it is possible to
reduce signiﬁcantly the drift of the ionized electrons due to
the Lorentz force of the laser ﬁeld (the ionized electron tra-
jectory in the sinusoidal pulse is shown as a dashed line, in
the tailored pulse as a solid line). Therefore, the rescattering
probability can be increased by several orders of magnitude
in the relativistic regime of laser-atom interactions. x and z

ing of the laser pulse is aimed to concentrate the ionizing
and afterwards the accelerating laser forces in short time
intervals within the laser period (maintaining the aver-
age intensity of the pulse constant) which substantially
reduces the relativistic drift. This results from the fact
that in the tailored laser pulse, fragments in the electron
trajectory are avoided, in contrast to the sinusoidal laser
pulse, in which the electron acceleration is compensated
by deceleration without a net energy gain by the elec-
tron, but during which nevertheless the electron would
continue to drift in the laser propagation direction (see
Fig. 3(ii)). This substantially decreases the time span
during which the electron moves with a relativistic ve-
locity. The latter results in a shorter drift in the laser

propagation direction, and therefore, in an increase of
the recombination probability in the case of the tailored
pulse.

The scenario of the electron motion in the tailored laser
pulse looks as follows. The trajectory of the rescattering
electron begins at the end of the period with maximal
ﬁeld strength of the laser pulse, shortly before the ﬁeld
free region. The initial spike of the laser pulse ionizes
the electron and initiates its excursion with a very low
initial velocity. The acceleration of the electron takes
place during the next spike after the ﬁeld free region.
One can see from Fig. 3 that in the tailored wave the
electron gains most of its energy only shortly before the
recombination and the trajectory of the electron in the
tailored pulse is spatially signiﬁcantly shorter than in the
sinusoidal wave.

The procedure for tailoring the laser pulse is the follow-
ing. The laser pulse with temporal form as shown in Fig.2
has been chosen with the additional condition of vanish-
ing the ﬁeld average of the pulse < E >= 0. Then, the

and z are the polarization and propagation direction of the

Fourier-expansion of this pulse is used via K = 100 har-
monic terms to optimize the ﬁeld expansion coeﬃcients
by maximizing the rescattering (HHG) probability. The
optimized tailored pulse has the form of an APT which
includes three key features. The ﬁrst is a large ionization
peak with a strong decay after the point of ionization
(the stronger decay the larger HHG eﬃciency). This fol-
lows by a long region with an only weak ﬁeld strength
(the longer the better) which is resumed by a short and
strong pulse that induces most of the energy of the ion-
ized electron. The optimized pulse along with its spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 2. The rescattering rate resulting
from this pulse can be enhanced by using more frequency
components in the APT. In the calculated spectra that
will follow, we employ 100 frequency components. When
using only K = 30 harmonics in the tailored pulse, the
HHG yield decreases by approximately 2 orders of magni-
1018 W/cm2 and by 5 orders
tude at laser intensity of 5
1019 W/cm2. A possible experimen-
of magnitude for 5
tal way for the above mentioned tailoring of the laser
pulses is to employ relativistic harmonics generated dur-
ing a laser-foil interaction in the so-called sliding mirror
regime [15] which yields very strong APT’s with a con-
version eﬃciency of a few percent. Additionally the tech-
nique for the spectral ﬁltering [12] should be applied to
form the necessary spectral dips as shown in Fig. 2. Sig-
niﬁcantly less spectral ﬁltering would be necessary when
using K = 30 harmonics and a APT spectrum with one
hump, though in this case the HHG yield will be reduced
as indicated above.

Given the tailored laser pulse, we proceed to calculate
the HHG intensity. Our investigation of HHG in an opti-
mized tailored laser pulse is based on the solution of the
Klein-Gordon equation in the strong ﬁeld approximation
(SFA) [17]. We consider the HHG process of an atomic
system by a linearly polarized plane laser ﬁeld for the
relativistic parameter regime. The direction of the laser
ﬁeld polarization is along the x axis, that of the magnetic
ﬁeld along the y, and of the laser propagation along the
z axis. The amplitude of HHG within the SFA based on
the Klein-Gordon equation in the single-active electron
approximation is given by the following expression [18]

The HHG spectrum with the tailored pulse is com-
pared with two calculations for the harmonic emission
using a sinusoidal ﬁeld. While the ﬁrst calculation is
based on the dipole approximation (DA), the second one
is fully-relativistic. We consider two regimes: the moder-
ately relativistic regime with a laser intensity of the tai-
1018 W/cm2 and the strongly relativistic
lored pulse 5
1019 W/cm2, each with
regime with a laser intensity of 5

ing to a laser wavelength of λ = 456 nm. Taking into
account a few percent eﬃciency in the APT generation
via laser-foil interaction [15], as well as about 20% inten-
sity reduction because of spectral ﬁltering in the case of
K = 100 spectral components in APT, the initial laser
intensity before tailoring should be three orders of mag-
nitude larger. For pulses involving fewer high harmonics
this loss may be reduced.

In the moderately relativistic regime (see Fig.4(i)), the
harmonic emission rate with conventional laser ﬁeld is
suppressed by over seven orders of magnitude in the
relativistic treatment compared with the results in the
DA. Whereas the tailored pulse yields a harmonic emis-
sion rate that is nearly four orders of magnitude higher
than the rate in the dipole approximation. Further the
spectrum induced by the tailored pulse as well as the
spectrum induced by the sinusoidal ﬁeld using the DA is
highly oscillating, resulting from interference of at least

the tailored pulse, there are exactly two, since the tra-
jectories with multiple return to the ionic core are very
unlikely.

The HHG spectrum in the strong relativistic regime
1019 W/cm2 is shown in
with a laser intensity of 5
×
Fig. 4(ii). Whereas the tailored pulse spectrum is still
more intense than the spectrum in the DA with a con-
ventional laser ﬁeld, the relativistic treatment of HHG
with sinusoidal ﬁelds yields a rate that is negligibly small.
From the HHG spectrum one can see that cutoﬀ energies
of more than 1 MeV are reachable with the probability
not less than in the DA.

The enhancement of the HHG rate via tailored pulses
compared with the one via a sinusoidal ﬁeld is due to
the suppressed relativistic drift. This can be deduced by
comparing the trajectory of the ionized cutoﬀ electron
driven by the tailored pulse with one driven by the sinu-
soidal pulse, see Fig. 3(i). The excursion of the ionized
electron in polarization and propagation direction in the
tailored pulse is shorter, though the averaged intensity
of the pulses are the same. Moreover, the HHG emission
angle with respect to the laser polarization direction in
the tailored pulse is signiﬁcantly smaller than in the con-
ventional sinusoidal ﬁeld (see Fig. 3(i)). In other terms,
the suppressed drift can be deduced by the value of ini-
tial electron velocity in the laser propagation direction,
necessary for the electron rescattering in the relativistic
regime. In the tailored pulse it is much smaller compared
to that for a sinusoidal pulse.
In fact, in the strongly
relativistic regime, the numerical values for the initial
velocity in the tailored pulse is -6 a.u., whereas for the
sinusoidal ﬁeld -97 a.u.. The initial velocity of the tun-
neled electron determines the exponential damping fac-
tor of the electron tunneling probability, yielding a higher
ionization rate and, therefore, a higher HHG eﬃciency,
in the tailored pulse as compared to the sinusoidal ﬁeld.
The reason for the increased HHG rate with the tai-

4

lored laser pulse over the dipole approximation rate is
that the laser electric ﬁeld strength at the time of ioniza-
tion is higher in the tailored pulse at the same average
E(˜η′′)
laser intensity. The numerical values are

Further, one can make a statement about the stability
of the HHG process driven by such a tailored laser pulse.
A random variation of the amplitude of the frequency
components by 5 percent, and of the phases within the
range not exceeding π/100, results in a variation of the
HHG yield within one order of magnitude.

×

Concluding, employing specially tailored laser pulses
in the form of an APT allows to suppress the relativis-
tic drift of the ionized electron and to realize ionization-
rescattering in the relativistic regime. HHG in the hard
x-ray domain and the initiation of nuclear reactions with
single ions thus become feasible.

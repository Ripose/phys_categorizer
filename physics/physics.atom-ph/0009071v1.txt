The recently reported precise experimental determination of the dipole polarizability of the H+
2
molecular ion ground state [P.L. Jacobson, R.A. Komara, W.G. Sturrus, and S.R. Lundeen, Phys.
Rev. A 62, 012509 (2000)] reveals a discrepancy between theory and experiment of about 0.0007a3
0,
which has been attributed to relativistic and QED eﬀects. In present work we analyze an inﬂuence
of the relativistic eﬀects on the scalar dipole polarizability of an isolated H+
2 molecular ion. Our
conclusion is that it accounts for only 1/5 of the measured discrepancy.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent measurements [1,2] of the scalar electric dipole polarizability of H+

2 molecular ion through the study of
H2 molecule states with one Rydberg electron stimulated the introduction of methods [3]– [6] which are able to
accurately describe wave functions of molecular ions with two heavy nuclei beyond the adiabatic approximation.
The accuracy for the dipole polarizability constant (∼ 10−7a3
0) reached in the last work [6] in its turn become a
challenge to experiment. The new experimental work [2] substantially increases the accuracy of measurements and
reveals a discrepancy of about 0.0007a3
0 between theory and experiment, which can not be accounted for within
purely nonrelativistic approximation. In present work we consider relativistic corrections of order α2 to the dipole
polarizability of the ground state of an isolated H+

2 molecular ion.

We adopt atomic units (e = ¯h = m = 1) throughout this paper. The interaction with an external electric ﬁeld (details
of the nonrelativistic treatment of the problem can be found in previous papers [3]– [6]) is expressed by

Let us introduce H1 = H0 + VB, then the scalar dipole polarizability αs with account of relativistic corrections can

be rewritten in a form (we assume that VB ≈ α2H0 and ΨB

0 = Ψ0 + ΨB)

(8)

and ΨB = (E0 − H0)−1VB|Ψ0i. Thus relativistic correction to the scalar dipole polarizability αs is reduced to
evaluation of the following matrix elements

∆αs =−2µ2hΨ0|zc(E0 − H0)−1 (VB − hVBi) (E0 − H0)−1zc|Ψ0i

−2µ2hΨ0|VB(E0 − H0)−1zc(E0 − H0)−1zc|Ψ0i
−2µ2hΨ0|zc(E0 − H0)−1zc(E0 − H0)−1VB|Ψ0i.

At this point we can note that the spin–orbit term does not contribute to αs since the magnetic dipole operator has
selection rules m′ = m ± 1.

III. VARIATIONAL NONRELATIVISTIC WAVE FUNCTION

Variational wave function describing the ground state of the hydrogen molecular ion is taken in a form

∞

Ψ0 =

Xi=1 hCi cos(νiR12) + Di sin(νiR12)i

×e−αir1−βir2−γiR12 + (r1 ↔ r2).

(10)

Here αi, βi, γi, and νi are parameters generated in a quasirandom manner,

αi = (cid:22) 1

2

i(i + 1)√pα(cid:23) [(A2 − A1) + A1],

where ⌊x⌋ designates the fractional part of x, pα and qα are some prime numbers, the end points of an interval [A1, A2]
are real variational parameters. Parameters βi, γi, and νi are obtained in a similar way. Details of the method and
discussion of various aspects of its application can be found in our previous papers [7,8].

The perturbed function Ψ1 = µ(E0 − H0)−1rcΨ0 is expanded in the similar way

Ψ1 =

∞

Xi=1

r1h ˆCi cos(νiR12) + ˆDi sin(νiR12)i

×e−αir1−βir2−γiR12 + (r1 ↔ r2).

(11)

Technically evaluation of the matrix elements in Eq. (9) can proceed in the following way. For the matrix element
in the ﬁrst line we need to solve one linear equation, (E0 − H0)Ψ1 = zcΨ0, and then average operator (VB − hVBi
over Ψ1. To get rid of singularities in the solutions of implicit equations of lines 2 and 3 of Eq. (9) one can solve a
sequence of equations from the right to the left in the second line and in the reverse order for the third line. In the
latter two cases solution as well as the rhs of the last equation should be projected onto subspace orthogonal to Ψ0.

IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

In Table I results of numerical calculations are presented. For the zeroth-order approximation a wave function with

a basis set of N = 800 has been used that yields the nonrelativistic energy

which is in a good agreement with our previous accurate result [8]. Here mp = 1836.152701me is adopted. As seen
from the Table convergence for the relativistic correction is slower due to singular operators encountered in the matrix
elements. Nevertheless we can conclude from this Table that the resulting value is

E0 = −0.59713906312340(1),

(12)

∆αs = −0.00015214(1).

(13)

Combining this result with the nonrelativistic value from the Table I one obtains that the static electric dipole

polarizability of H+

2 molecular ion ground state with relativistic α2 corrections is to be

αs = 3.1685737(1).

(14)

We see that thus obtained value for the dipole polarizability does not fully account for present disagreement between
theory and experiment (comparison of our results with results of previous calculations and experiment are presented
in Table II). Our consideration does not include leading order QED corrections but usually they are one order of
magnitude smaller than relativistic corrections and have a diﬀerent sign. Thus they could not cover the rest 4/5 of
the discrepancy.

On the other hand the experimental value for the dipole polarizability has been deduced from the eﬀective model
Hamiltonian [11] which is a fully nonrelativistic Hamiltonian and it does not include the retardation Casimir–Polder
eﬀect [12] for the Rydberg electron. On the importance of this phenomena has been pointed out in a paper of Babb and
Spruch [13]. So, our conclusion is that the Casimir–Polder potential has to be included into the eﬀective Hamiltonian
to meet the requirements of the present level of experimental accuracy. That will enable to deduce scalar electric
dipole polarizability in a more reliable way.

We present a quantum-mechanical calculation of Stark line widths from

electron-ion collisions for the 2s1/2−
transitions in B III. The results conﬁrm the previous quantum-mechanical R-

2p1/2,3/2, λ = 2066 and 2067 ˚A, resonance

matrix calculations but contradict recent measurements and semi-classical

and some semi-empirical calculations. The diﬀerences between the calcula-

tions can be attributed to the dominance of small L partial waves in the

electron-atom scattering, while the large Stark widths inferred from the mea-

surements would be substantially reduced if allowance is made for hydro-

dynamic turbulence from high Reynolds number ﬂows and the associated

I. INTRODUCTION

The Stark broadening of spectral lines is due to interactions of the emitting atom (ion)

with electrons and ions in a plasma [1]. The resulting line proﬁles can serve as an impor-

tant tool for plasma diagnostics in a very broad range of plasma parameters.

It should

be emphasized, however, that Stark broadening diagnostics generally require quite elabo-

rate calculations. Therefore, comparison of theoretical line proﬁles with the Stark widths

measured for well determined plasma conditions is very important for the improvement of

theoretical approximations and techniques.

Recently, accurate line proﬁle measurements of the 2s

2p ﬁne-structure components

−

of the resonance doublet in Li-like Boron were performed by Glenzer and Kunze [2]. They

used a homogeneous plasma region in a gas-liner pinch discharge; and plasma parameters,

such as local electron density and ion temperature, were independently determined by 90o

collective Thomson scattering. The Stark line widths were measured to be w

0.22 ˚A for

≃

an electron density Ne = 1.8

1018 cm−3 and temperatures Ti = Te = 10.6 eV. This value

of w is within 25% of the results of semi-empirical [1,3] and semi-classical [4,5] calculations

and exceeds the quantum-mechanical R-matrix calculations [6] almost by a factor of 2. A

similar discrepancy between measurements and quantum-mechanical calculations had been

noticed previously for 2s

2p resonance transitions in another Li-like ion, namely, Be II [7].

In this paper we calculate the Stark line width of the 2s

2p transitions in B III. In

Sec.

II the theoretical approach and atomic data used in our calculations are presented.

Then, in Sec.

III, we present the results and discuss the reasons for diﬀerences between

quantum-mechanical and other calculations as well as experiment. Finally, Sec. IV contains

where Ne is the electron density, v is the velocity of the scattering electron, and F (v) is the

Maxwellian electron velocity distribution. The electron impact cross sections σuu

′ (σll

′ ) rep-

resent contributions from transitions connecting the upper (lower) level with other perturb-

ing levels (indicated by primes). In Eq. (1), the fu (θ, v) and fl (θ, v) are elastic scattering

amplitudes for the target ion in the upper and lower states, respectively, and the integral is

performed over the scattering angle θ, with dΩ being the element of solid angle. Equation

(1) relates a line width in the impact approximation with atomic cross sections, facilitating

the use of well-developed techniques of atomic scattering calculations for line broadening

studies. The inelastic terms account for broadening due to life-time shortening, i.e., broad-

ening associated with decaying amplitudes of the emitted waves. The elastic terms are due

to phase shifts between wave trains before and after collisions; these phase shifts arise from

the diﬀerences in perturbations of upper and lower levels.

The electron impact broadening of the 2s

2p principal resonance lines in Li-like ions

diﬀers from the broadening of other lines (like, e.g., 3s

3p) due to the speciﬁc level structure

of Li-like ions. Both initial and ﬁnal levels of this transition are well separated from the other

excited levels, the energy diﬀerence between 2s and 2p states being much smaller than the

broadening of this line. Additionally, the temperature of maximal abundance of B III in

plasmas is a few times smaller than its ionization potential 37.9 eV unless the plasma is

rapidly ionizing. Therefore, it is hardly possible to have B III resonance lines in high-

temperature, high-density plasmas where inelastic perturbations due to interactions with

n

3 levels would become important.

≥

Quite surprisingly, practically no accurate atomic data were available for B III until

very recently. The evaluated bibliographic compilation of electron impact excitation cross

sections for ions [9] contains only one paper on B III with poor accuracy. This diﬀers dras-

tically from the other members of the Li-like sequence (Be II, C IV, etc.), where on the

average more than 15 papers were published for each ion, some calculations being claimed

to be accurate to within 10%. Fortunately, very accurate results for excitation cross sec-

tions from the ground state of B III have recently been achieved [10]. They were obtained

with two new methods in atomic collision theory, viz., Convergent Close-Coupling (CCC)

[11,12] and R-Matrix with pseudostates (RMPS) [13], which proved to be very successful

in calculations of electron scattering on quasi-one-electron ions (see, e.g. [14]). Although

the CCC and RMPS methods are quite close in principle, the agreement of independently

obtained results which are separately checked for convergence in coordinate and momentum

subspaces is a very convincing argument for these data to be accurate. The CCC method

is a standard close-coupling approach where all target states (discrete and continuum) are

obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a large orthogonal Laguerre basis, and the

coupled equations are formulated in momentum space. Therefore, the convergence can be

easily tested by simply increasing the basis size. The use of momentum space allows one to

avoid the common diﬃculties related to the oscillating behavior of wavefunctions in coordi-

nate space. The RMPS method [13] is a modiﬁcation of the standard low-energy R-matrix

approach [15], where a much larger number of pseudo-orbitals is taken into account. This

signiﬁcantly improves the description of both the physical target states and highly excited

and continuum pseudostates. For details on these methods see, e.g., [13,16].

For calculations of 2l

3l′ and 2l

4l′′ cross sections, which are relatively small, we

−

−

used the Coulomb-Born-exchange (CBE) code ATOM (the details of the basic approxima-

tions can be found in [17]). It should be noted that in addition to accounting for Coulomb

attraction and exchange eﬀects, ATOM calculates inelastic cross sections with experimen-

tal energy diﬀerences between the states involved and allows for normalization (unitarity)

5

eﬀects. Unlike more sophisticated and time-consuming CCC and RMPS codes running at

least on workstations, ATOM quickly generates many cross sections on a modest PC, which

makes it especially suitable for large-scale collisional calculations. Although the application

of the CBE method to a relatively low charge ion such as B III may be questioned, the

diﬀerence between the ATOM and CCC/RMPS cross sections is mostly only about 30% at

threshold. (For highly charged Li-like ions the CBE and CCC results agree much better

with each other [18].)

A. 2s and 2p eﬀects

The non-Coulomb elastic scattering amplitudes f2s (θ, v) and f2p (θ, v) were calculated

with the CCC method. The corresponding elastic cross sections σ2s(E) and σ2p(E) as well

It should be noted also that even at threshold

the electron exchange contributes not more than 10% of the total cross section. For small

energies the CBE cross sections lie systematically above the RMPS result, but the diﬀerence

is only 20% near the energy of interest. As the semi-empirical Van Regemorter formula for

the cross section by a factor of 2. This clearly demonstrates that one should be very cautious

when choosing a speciﬁc form of the Gaunt factor. (Measurements of near threshold cross

sections and excitation rate coeﬃcients for C IV [21] also favor Eq. (3) for ¯g, while earlier

plasma measurements [22] for N V, O VI and Ne VIII at temperatures well above ∆E give

eﬀective Gaunt factors that are mostly smaller than those according to Eqs. (3) and (4) by

factors 1.5 to 2.)

and CBE methods (here LT is the total angular momentum of the system ion+electron).

Remarkably, both approximations show very similar behavior for this ratio with slight devi-

ations for very low LT . It is obvious that the major contribution comes from rather small L

partial waves, so that the partial cross sections with total angular momentum up to LT = 4

give more than 60% of the total cross section. Even smaller L values dominate the elastic

scattering contribution for which monopole (Λ = 0) contributions are very important.

To summarize, for an electron density Ne = 1.8

for an electron temperature of Te = 10.6 eV and an electron density of Ne = 1.8

cm−3. In Table I we compare the experimental line width wexp [2] with diﬀerent theoretical

calculations [1,3–6]. The two last columns in this Table present the results of our calculations,

viz., the next to the last column corresponds to Eq. (5), while the line width in the last

column was obtained with CBE for all inelastic cross sections and the elastic term from CCC.

The available B III 2s

2p Stark widths are also shown in Fig. 4 as a function of electron

−

temperature. Our calculations presented here agree with the R-matrix results of Seaton [6]

practically for all temperatures, thereby conﬁrming the discrepancy with experiment. The

20% diﬀerence in CCC and R-matrix line widths for very small Te, where elastic collisions

dominate, seems to be related to the strong cancellation eﬀects in the scattering amplitude

diﬀerence (see Sec.II). On the other hand, the latest semi-classical calculations [4,5] do agree

with the previous results obtained with similar methods [1,3] as well as with the measured

value of the line width, although for small Te the results of Dimitrijevi´c and Sahal-Brechot

[4] deviate signiﬁcantly from the other calculations. We also show modiﬁed semi-empirical

results [23] which, although calculated only up to

7 eV, are very close to both sets of

∼

quantum-mechanical calculations.

Having conﬁrmed the results of the quantum calculations of Seaton [6], a ﬁrst question is

why impact-parameter, semi-classical [4,5] and closely related semi-empirical [1,3] methods

lead to substantially larger widths (closer to the experiment). The answer is related to the

dominant role of collisions corresponding to total angular momentum quantum numbers

LT ≤

4 (see Sec. II) of the (colliding) electron-ion system. This fact is equivalent to saying

9

that the spread of wave packets constructed in order to represent the colliding electrons

classically is comparable to or larger than relevant impact parameters. (The ratio of de-

Broglie wavelength λ and impact parameter ρ is λ/ρ = 2π¯h/mρv = 2π/L.) The wave

packet spread leads to a reduction of the electron-ion interaction and thus to a decrease in

the ensuing line width. This occurs because the electric ﬁelds causing Stark broadening are

generated by local deviations from plasma charge neutrality, and because these deviations are

reduced over spatial scales of the order of the de-Broglie wavelength. Note also that even

most recent semi-classical calculations [24] explicitly account only for long-range, dipole

(Λ = 1,

r−2) and quadrupole (Λ = 2,

r−3) perturbations, although for collisions within

The theoretical conclusion that semi-classical calculations overestimate the electron col-

lisional broadening of the B III 2s

2p lines by a factor of about 2 leaves one with the

−

dilemma of having about the same disagreement with the experiment [2], for which the

combined error in Stark width and electron density measurements was estimated to about

20%. A natural suggestion is to reconsider any possible systematic errors, a probable cause

for such errors being hydrodynamic turbulence associated with plasma ﬂows in the gas-liner,

Z-pinch experiment [2], similar to the MHD turbulence invoked [27,28] for interpretations

of high-power Z-pinch experiments. This would be analogous to a more extreme situation

encountered in the measurement of C V 1s2s

1s2p lines [29] which had also been found to

−
be substantially broader than predicted theoretically. However, in this theoretically rather

similar case of ∆n = 0 transitions of He-like ions, there are both singlet and triplet lines, at

rather diﬀerent wavelengths of λ= 3526 ˚A or 2271 and 2277˚A, respectively. The measured

widths were proportional to λ rather than λ2, indicating Doppler rather than Stark broad-

ening to dominate. Since these widths were larger than expected from thermal Doppler

broadening and from Doppler shifts associated with radial ﬂows, hydrodynamic turbulence

in the laser-produced plasma used was inferred from this excess broadening, with an eﬀective

temperature of 600 eV.

Although radial laser-blowoﬀ and pinch implosion velocities are very similar in these

experiments, both approaching 107 cm/sec, there is, of course, an essential diﬀerence in that

the B III measurements were made in a 50 nsec interval shortly after maximum compression,

while the C V measurements were taken while axial velocities were still about 3

107 cm/sec.

·

However, this distinction may not be very important, because any turbulence from high

Reynolds number ﬂows decays only on a time scale τ of l/∆v [30], if l is a characteristic

length and ∆v a typical spatial diﬀerence of ﬂow velocities. With l

1 cm and ∆v

the B III measurement interval.

Since the implosion takes more than 1 µsec, developed and saturated turbulence seems

therefore unavoidable, R being larger than critical Reynolds numbers [30]. Note also that

any magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects are not likely to reduce the turbulence signiﬁcantly, both because

ﬁelds and plasma are probably fairly well separated [32] and because the corresponding

parameter ωciτi is well below 1 in any case (here ωci is the ion gyrofrequency and τi is the

ion-ion collision time). Another question is the extent to which the turbulence is transported

radially inward or mixed into the test gas region. However, even local Reynolds numbers

are probably above critical over most of this region and signiﬁcant Reynolds stresses would

be needed to compensate for the reduction in particle pressure implied below.

The reader may wonder whether the (collective) Thomson scattering diagnostics [33,34]

used in the B III experiment [2] would not have indicated the existence of hydrodynamic

turbulence. For suﬃciently high concentrations of heavier elements in the hydrogen ﬁll gas,

the so-called impurity peak would then indeed indicate a higher temperature for these ions

than for protons (see, e.g.., Fig. 6 of Ref. [33]), although the larger width of this peak near

peak compression could just as well be caused by turbulent velocities close to the thermal

velocities of the protons provided the turbulent eddies are smaller than the scattering volume.

For relatively high impurity concentrations, radiative energy losses are very important [35],

facilitating a more rapid decay of the turbulence than estimated above. This is consistent

with the narrower impurity peaks at later times (see Fig. 5 of Ref. [33]), whose widths are

consistent with thermal Doppler broadening at equal temperatures for the various ions.

The B III experiment, on the other hand, was done with very small concentrations of

BF3 to avoid self-absorption of the 2s

2p lines. The impurity feature on the scattering

−

12

spectrum could therefore not be observed [36], and at the same time the dissipation of the

turbulent energy would have taken much longer, say, the 1 µsec plasma life time quoted

in Ref. [2]. One is therefore left with the possibility of an alternative interpretation of the

scattering spectra, e.g., of that shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. [36]. Namely, instead of inferring

a temperature of 10 eV, essentially from the width of the proton feature, assume turbulent

rms velocities equal to proton thermal velocities. This also means lower temperatures for

the protons, say, 5 eV. As emphasized by Glenzer and Kunze [2], electron-ion relaxation

times are extremely short, so that we also infer Te ≃
electron temperature for the observation of the B III 2s

5 eV. This is a much more favorable

2p lines than 10 eV in this nearly

−

steady state plasma, because at 5 eV about 20% of the boron ions are B III, contrasted

to less than 1% at 10 eV. Independent evidence for Te <
∼

5 eV could be provided by the

absence of the 3d

4f line at 2077 ˚A, reported in Ref. [2], whose intensity was evidently

−

5% of the 2066 ˚A line. At 10 eV, the relative intensity of the 2077 ˚A line would be about

<
∼
1. (Note that standard LTE relations can be used for this estimate, to within about 10%

for the temperature. Since the 3d

4f line may be about 3˚A wide, corresponding line ratio

−

measurements would best be done at reduced spectral resolution.) Any deviations between

shapes of thermal and thermal plus turbulence scattering spectra would probably be too

small to be observable, leaving its width as the major invariant. Some deviations could, of

course, be indications of non-Gaussian distributions of the turbulent velocity components.

Besides suggesting investigations of turbulence in the gas-liner pinch, perhaps along the

lines of Ref. [34] and by use of line pairs with diﬀerent sensitivities to Stark and Doppler

broadening [29], it remains to be shown that the level of turbulence assumed here would

suﬃce to obtain agreement of measured line widths with quantum-mechanical calculations.

Note ﬁrst that there will be no signiﬁcant change in the electron density, Ne = 1.8
cm−3, because of the large value of the scattering parameter α, i.e., of (kλD)−1, k here being

·

1018

the wavenumber of the electron density ﬂuctuation responsible for the scattering and λD

the Debye length [33]. However, the predicted electron-collisional width of, e.g., Ref. [6],

is now 0.14 ˚A because of the reduced electron temperature, whereas the predicted total

13

Doppler width is increased by a factor (11.8/2)1/2 to 0.125 ˚A, 11.8 = 10.8 + 1 standing for

turbulent plus thermal Doppler broadening at a boron/proton mass ratio of 10.8, 1/2 for

the reduction in temperature. With 0.07 and 0.05 ˚A Lorentzian and Gaussian instrumental

broadening [36] and 0.02 ˚A proton impact broadening [4], this gives a total line width [37,38]

of 0.28 ˚A, i.e., more than 90% of the measured total width [2]. There would therefore be

agreement well within combined experimental and theoretical errors relative to the previous

quantum-mechanical calculations and, more marginally, also with the present calculations,

which result in 0.27 ˚A, if one allows again for a 0.02 ˚A contribution from ion-ion collisions,

were the degree of turbulence indeed as high as assumed here. Veriﬁcation of this assumption

would remove a major obstacle in our quantitative understanding of Stark broadening of

isolated lines from multiply ionized atoms, including possibly the anomalous scaling of line

widths along isoelectronic sequences [39–42]. In the last experiment, on 2s3s

2s3p line

widths of Be-like Neon, improved semi-classical calculations [24] were found to be consistent

with the measured widths, but judging from the present B III 2s

2p comparisons and

−

given similar ratios of impact parameters and bound state radii, this agreement may again

be spurious.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

A fully quantum-mechanical calculation of the Stark line width for the 2s

2p line of

B III was carried out with the use of the latest atomic data reﬂecting the present state-

of-the-art in atomic collision theory. Although the obtained results agree well with the

previous quantum R-matrix Stark widths, the diﬀerence with semi-classical and some semi-

empirical calculations as well as with the measured values is of order of 2. This seems to

originate in (i) failure of the non-quantum calculations for small impact parameters which

are most important for the line width in question, and from (ii) not accounting for the

turbulent plasma motion which signiﬁcantly aﬀects the determination of Doppler broadening

and plasma temperature. Independent ion line width measurements for plasmas with well-

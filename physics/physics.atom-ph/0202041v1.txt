Molecular Condensates via Feshbach-Enhanced Cooperative Photoassociation

Matt Mackie

(February 21, 2014)

While photoassociation and the Feshbach resonance are, in principle, feasible means for creating a
molecular Bose-Einstein condensate from an already-quantum-degenerate gas of atoms, irreversible
decay ultimately puts serious practical limitations on achieving near-unit eﬃciency with either mech-
anism alone. Hence, we propose Feshbach-enhanced photoassociation as an enabler of near-unit eﬃ-
cient atom → stable molecule conversion, focusing on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Beyond
the creation of a stable molecular condensate, we also predict observable cooperative behavior in a
Fermi-degenerate gas.

Pacs number(s): 03.75.Fi, 05.30.Jp, 34.20.Cf

Photoassociation occurs when a pair of colliding ul-
tracold atoms absorb a laser photon [1], thereby jump-
ing from the two-atom continuum to a bound molecular
state. If the initial atoms are Bose-condensed [2–4], then
the subsequent molecules will also form a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) [5,6]. In addition to translation, the
molecular degrees of freedom include rotation and vibra-
tion, so that the laser cooling techniques used to create
an atomic BEC are diﬃcult, if not impossible, to apply to
molecules, and photoassociation thus oﬀers a backdoor of
sorts to the production of a molecular condensate. Nev-
ertheless, photoassociation generally occurs to an excited
molecular state, and the subsequent radiative losses will
limit the eﬃciency of atom-molecule conversion to some-
thing considerably less than unity. One might then con-
sider the addition of a second laser to drive molecular
population to a stable electronic state, whereby stimu-
lated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [7] in photoas-
sociation of a BEC [8] is, in principle, the obvious means
for achieving near-unit eﬃciency. However, collisions be-
tween particles make it diﬃcult to maintain adiabaticity,
allowing spontaneous decay a chance to limit the practi-
cal eﬃciency of STIRAP to less than ﬁfty percent [9].

On the other hand, the process known as the Feshbach
resonance [10] occurs when two ultracold atoms collide
in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, whereby the hyper-
ﬁne interaction ﬂips the electronic and nuclear spins of
one of the colliding atoms, and the pair jump from the
two-atom continuum to a quasibound molecular state.
As with photoassociation, the so-formed molecules will
constitute a BEC if the incident atoms are themselves
Bose-condensed [11,12]. Unfortunately, the quasibound
condensate, while translationally and rotationally ultra-
cold, is vibrationally very hot, and thus highly suscep-
tible to collision-induced vibrational relaxation [12,13].
Hence, while an adiabatic sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld
across the Feshbach resonance will,
in principle, cre-
ate a quasibound molecular condensate with near-unit
eﬃciency [14], vibrational relaxation will occur on a
timescale that renders this scheme all but useless.

The purpose of this Letter is to develop a means for

creating a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate that is
near-unit eﬃcient in both principle and practice, and
we therefore combine photoassociation with the Fesh-
In
bach resonance to form a magneto-optical scheme.
particular, we propose stimulated Raman adiabatic pas-
sage from an atomic to a stable molecular BEC in the
presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld. Ultimately, the Fes-
hbach resonance acts to enhance the free-bound dipole
matrix elements, and thus overcomes limitations on adi-
abaticity imposed by collisions [9]. A version of this
scheme, where STIRAP-inducing lasers are run concur-
rently with an adiabatic sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld, has
been proposed for sodium [15]; however, the changing
magnetic ﬁeld introduces a time-dependence to the en-
ergy of the quasibound state, and this fact, along with
unfavorable timescales for collisions and vibrational re-
laxation in sodium, limits the overall conversion eﬃciency
to about twenty percent. On the contrary, by employ-
ing a static magnetic ﬁeld, and considering a statistics-
independent formalism, we ﬁnd not only a practical pos-
sibility for near-unit production of a molecular conden-
sate, but a strong chance to observe collective eﬀects in
a gas of fermionic atoms.

We model a two-component quantum degenerate gas
of atoms coupled via a Feshbach resonance to a conden-
sate of quasibound molecules. Additionally, one laser
drives quasibound
excited-bound molecular transi-
tions, thus creating a condensate of excited molecules,
and a second laser induces excited-bound
ground tran-
sitions to a stable molecular condensate. The initial
atoms are denoted by the ﬁeld φ1,2(r, t), the quasibound
molecules by the ﬁeld ψ1(r, t), the excited molecules by
the ﬁeld ψ2(r, t), and, ﬁnally, the ground state molecules
by the ﬁeld ψ3(r, t). The atoms may be either bosonic or
fermionic, whereas the molecules are strictly bosonic. All
ﬁelds obey the appropriate commutation relations. For
the moment, we neglect both collisions and irreversible
losses. Assuming that these ﬁve modes suﬃciently de-
scribe the relevant physics, the Heisenberg equations
of motion that govern the evolution of the atomic and
molecular ﬁelds are

The term ¯α = √ρα would have previously been referred
to as the Bose-stimulated free-bound coupling [8]; how-
ever, since the above equations of motion are statistics in-
dependent, we realize that Bose stimulation (in this case)
has nothing whatsoever to do with bosons, but is instead
a many-body eﬀect that applies equally well to Fermi de-
generate systems. A further example, already observed
in a BEC [16], is four-wave mixing [17,18] in a Fermi-
degenerate gas of atoms [19–21]. Hereafter, we there-
fore coin a more appropriate term for ¯α: the collective-
enhanced free-bound coupling.

We now describe the process of stimulated Raman adi-
abatic passage in more detail. The hallmark of STIRAP
is the counterintuitive pulse sequence [7], which amounts
to adjusting the two lasers so that initially, when most
everything is in the quasibound molecular condensate ψ1,
ψ2 coupling is strongest, and ﬁnally, when ef-
the ψ3 ↔
fectively everything is in the stable molecular condensate

ψ2 coupling is strongest. As the popu-
ψ3, the ψ1 ↔
lation moves from quasibound to stable molecules, the
state with the larger population is always weakly cou-
pled to the ﬁeld ψ2, thus keeping the population of the
excited molecular condensate low (ideally zero) and re-
ducing (eliminating) losses. We note that the case in
point is a bound-bound-bound process, as opposed to a
free-bound-bound one [8,9], and is not subject to collec-
tive enhancement.

The idea is near that a properly-timed counterintu-
itive pulse sequence, applied to a degenerate atomic gas
in the presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld, will deliver
the near-unit eﬃcient production of a molecular BEC. If
the appropriate frequency scale is the collective-enhanced
free-bound coupling ¯α, then the atom-quasibound sys-
tem will undergo coherent macroscopic oscillations, i.e.,
dynamics analogous to Josephson tunneling in super-
conductors [22], on a timescale given by 1/ ¯α, and we
need only wait for suﬃcient population to build– about
half an oscillation cycle– before eﬀecting STIRAP. In
our model we assume Gaussian laser pulses of the form
ti)2/T 2], where Ω0 determines the
Ωi = Ω0 exp[
pulse height [23], ti locates the pulse center, and T de-
ﬁnes the pulse width (i = 1, 2).

This piece of intuition is correct, as shown in Fig. 1.
For simplicity, we focus on a single-component BEC as
our initial quantum gas: φ1 = φ2 = φ, i ˙φ = 2 ¯αψ1. The
ﬁeld amplitudes are treated as c numbers, with initial
conditions φ(0) = 1 and ψi(0) = 0. The pulse parameters
are speciﬁed as ¯αT = 1/2, t2 = 5T , and t1 = 7T . Adi-
abaticity is assured by selecting pulse heights such that
Ω0T = 103. The atoms are tuned close to the Feshbach
resonance, and the molecules onto laser resonance, by the
10−2 and ∆ = δ = 0. The plot shows
choices ω1 =
the system beginning the ﬁrst Josephson oscillation cy-
cle, halfway thru which the laser pulses transfer nearly
the entire population to the stable molecular condensate.
Characteristic of a counterintuitive pulse sequence, ra-
diative losses are minimized by keeping the excited-state
population low, of the order of 10−5.

Turning to the practical caveats, we must consider the
importance of s-wave collisions, as well as loss-inducing
vibrational relaxation and dissociation of the quasibound
moelcules. The ﬁrst two process occur at the rates
10−10 cm−3 Hz. Elas-
Λ = 4π¯hρa/m and 2Γ = ρ
tic atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions are
neglected since the numbers are not known, whereas
molecule-molecule vibrational quenching can be taken to
occur at the atom-molecule rate Γ. Finally, dissociation
of the quasibounds back to the atomic continuum will oc-
cur analogously to photodissociation [6,24], and necessar-
ily involves “rogue” modes deﬁned as modes lying outside
the atomic condensate (Fermi sea). All told, rogue disso-
ciation is non-exponential, i.e., the Fermi Golden rule and
simple inclusion with a non-hermitian term [12,13,15] do
not strictly apply, and will impose a rate limit on atom-
molecule conversion. For bosons [24], said rate limit is
given roughly by 6¯hρ2/3/m; for fermions the process is

FIG. 1.

Creation of a stable molecular condensate via
Feshbach-enhanced collective photoassociation. The choice
¯α = 1 sets the unit of frequency (time). The STIRAP pulses
have equal width T = 1/2 and height Ω0 = 2 × 103, and are
centered at t2 = 2.5 and t1 = 3.5. The condensate fractions
are P0 = |φ|2 and Pi = 2|ψi|2. Evidently, as the ﬁrst half-cycle
of the Josephson oscillation nears completion, the lasers trans-
fer the population from the quasibound to the stable molec-
ular condensate with ninety-ﬁve percent eﬃciency. The max-
imum excited molecular condensate fraction is P2 ∼ 10−5.

by half, in turn doubling the maximum rate. From Fig. 1,
ninety-ﬁve percent of the atoms are converted in 3/ ¯α sec-
onds, corresponding to a rate R = 0.95 ¯α/3.

Referring to Table I, our practicum begins with
sodium [25]. At ﬁrst blush, vibrational relaxation makes
our scheme practically useless; however, if the density is
1012 cm−3 by, say, adiabatically expanding
lowered to
the trap, then the rates become favorable indeed. Next is
rubidium-85, chosen for its readily available data [26,27],
and which also looks very promising. Here we note that,
for the given millisecond conversion, experiments would
have to operate above resonance to avoid competing with
condensate collapse [28]. Since our formalism is statistics
independent, we might also consider fermionic isotopes,
and thus ﬁnd that potassium-40 [29] allows for a conver-
sion rate just below the rate limit.
In the end, should
dissociative losses prove unacceptable, one can envisage
a multiple-shot scheme, similar to Ref. [15], where a se-
ries of STIRAP pulses converts a smaller fraction of the
atoms at a time, and rogue dissociation is avoided by
keeping the quasibound population low. Finally, we con-
sider the prospects for lithium-6 [30], and ﬁnd that atom-
atom collisions will play a signiﬁcant role by shifting the
system oﬀ resonance. If it turns out that the condition
of equal Rabi pulses [23] is upset by adjusting the detun-
ing ω1 to account for collisions, then a multi-shot scheme
may again prove advantagous.

Admittedly, our predictions for fermions are based on
a BEC as an explicit example; nevertheless, our formal-
ism is not dependent on statistics. Collective enhance-
ment applies for fermions as well as bosons [17,18], and
so the half Josephson oscillation necessary to prime the
STIRAP run should still occur over a timescale
1/ ¯α,
as is evident in Ref. [31]. Although the chance of ob-
serving successive Josephson cycles [31] is diminished
by rogue dissociation, it should not be an issue for co-
operative photoassociation. The remaining concern is
whether the lasers will resolve individual fermions, which
would of course destroy any collective behavior. For the
above STIRAP parameters, the lasers will have an energy
spread of better than 15 µK. This width is insuﬃcient to
pick out individual atoms in a typical Fermi-degenerate
gas, which has a thermal spread of less than 1 µK.

∼

In principle, we have discovered a feasible method for
preparing a stable molecular condensate: (i) start with a
quantum degenerate gas of atoms, a magnetic ﬁeld tuned
at or near a Feshbach resonance, and a pair of lasers; (ii)
apply a properly-timed counterintuitive pulse sequence;
(iii) obtain a molecular condensate. In practice, degener-
ate 23Na [25], 85Rb [27], 40K [19], and 6Li [20,21] appear
as strong candidates for this scheme. As a bonus, we also
uncover an excellent means for observing cooperative be-
havior in present-day Fermi-degenerate systems.

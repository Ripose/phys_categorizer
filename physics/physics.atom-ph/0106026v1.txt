A novel method for calculating resonances in three-body Coulombic systems is proposed. The
Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations are solved by applying the Coulomb-Sturmian separable ex-
pansion method. The e

I. INTRODUCTION

For three-body systems the Faddeev equations are the
fundamental equations. Three-body bound states cor-
respond to the solutions of the homogeneous Faddeev
equations at real energies, and resonances, as is usual in
quantum mechanics, are related to complex-energy solu-
tions.

The Faddeev equations were derived for short-range
interactions. However, if we simply plug-in a Coulomb-
like potential they become singular. A formally exact
approach was proposed by Noble [1]. His formulation
was designed for solving the nuclear three-body Coulomb
problem, where all Coulomb interactions were repul-
sive. The interactions were split into short-range and
long-range Coulomb-like parts and the long-range parts
were formally included in the ”free” Green’s operator.
Merkuriev extended the idea of Noble by performing the
splitting in the three-body conﬁguration space [2]. This
was a crucial development since it made possible to treat
attractive Coulomb interactions on an equal footing with
repulsive ones.

Recently we have presented a method for treating
the three-body Coulomb scattering problem by solv-
ing Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations using the
Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion technique [3].
We solved the inhomogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev inte-
gral equations for real energies. Previously, for calculat-
ing resonances in three-body systems with short-range
plus repulsive Coulomb interactions, we solved homo-
geneous Faddeev-Noble integral equations by using the
Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion technique [4]. In
this paper by combining the concepts of Refs. [3] and [4]
we solve the homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral
equations for complex energies. This way we can han-
dle all kind of Coulomb-like potentials in resonant-state
calculations, not only repulsive but also attractive ones.
In section II we present the homogeneous Faddeev-
Merkuriev integral equations, outlined for systems where
two particles out of the three are identical. Many sys-
tems, like e−e+e− and H −, fall into this category. Then,
in section III, we present the solution method adapted to
the case where all charges have the same absolute value.
In section IV we present our calculations for the L = 0

resonances of the e−e+e− system up to the n = 5 thresh-
old and compare them with the results of complex scaling
calculations [5].

II. FADDEEV-MERKURIEV INTEGRAL
EQUATIONS

The Hamiltonian of a three-body Coulombic system

reads

H = H 0 + vC

1 + vC

2 + vC
3 ,

(1)

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and
vC
α denotes the Coulomb-like interaction in the subsys-
tem α. We use throughout the usual conﬁguration-space
Jacobi coordinates xα and yα. Thus vC
α only depends on
xα (vC
α (xα)). The Hamiltonian (1) is deﬁned in the
three-body Hilbert space. The two-body potential oper-
ators are formally embedded in the three-body Hilbert
space

α = vC

vC = vC (x)1y,

(2)

where 1y is a unit operator in the two-body Hilbert space
associated with the y coordinate. We also use the nota-
tion X = {xα, yα} ∈ R6.

The role of Coulomb potentials in Hamiltonian (1) are
twofold. Their long-distance parts modify the asymptotic
motion, while their short-range parts strongly correlate
the two-body subsystems. Merkuriev introduced a sepa-
ration of the three-body conﬁguration space into diﬀerent
asymptotic regions. The two-body asymptotic region Ωα
is deﬁned as a part of the three-body conﬁguration space
where the conditions

|xα| < x0

α(1 + |yα|/y0

α)1/ν,

(3)

α, y0

with x0
α > 0 and ν > 2, are satisﬁed. Merkuriev
proposed to split the Coulomb interaction in the three-
body conﬁguration space into short-range and long-range
terms

α = v(s)
vC

α + v(l)
α ,

(4)

1

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

where the superscripts s and l indicates the short- and
long-range attributes, respectively. The splitting is car-
ried out with the help of a splitting function ζα which
possesses the property

vC
3 is a repulsive Coulomb potential which does not sup-
port two-body bound states. Therefore the entire vC
3 can
be considered as long-range potential. The long-range
Hamiltonian is modiﬁed as

ζα(xα, yα)

Xα→∞
−−−−−→

1, Xα ∈ Ωα
0 otherwise.

(cid:26)

(5)

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

1 + v(l)

2 + vC
3 .

Then, the three-body Hamiltonian takes the form

In practice, in the conﬁguration-space diﬀerential equa-
tion approaches, usually the functional form

H = H (l) + v(s)

1 + v(s)
2 ,

ζ(x, y) = 2/

1 + exp

(x/x0)ν /(1 + y/y0)

,

(6)

(cid:8)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:9)

was used.

The long-range Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

i.e. the Hamiltonian of the system appears formally as a
three-body Hamiltonian with two short-range potentials.
Therefore the Faddeev procedure, in this case, gives a set
of two-component Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

1 + v(l)

2 + v(l)
3 ,

and its resolvent operator is

G(l)(z) = (z − H (l))

−1,

where z is the complex energy-parameter. Then, the
three-body Hamiltonian takes the form

H = H (l) + v(s)

1 + v(s)

2 + v(s)
3 ,

which formally looks like a three-body Hamiltonian with
short-range potentials. Therefore the Faddeev method is
applicable.

In the Faddeev procedure we split the wave function

into three components

|Ψi = |ψ1i + |ψ2i + |ψ3i,

(10)

where the components are deﬁned by

|ψαi = G(l)(z)v(s)

α |Ψi.

(11)

In case of bound and resonant states the wave-function
components satisfy the homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev
integral equations

|ψ1i = G(l)
|ψ2i = G(l)
|ψ3i = G(l)

1 (z)v(s)
2 (z)v(s)
3 (z)v(s)

1 [|ψ2i + |ψ3i]
2 [|ψ1i + |ψ3i]
3 [|ψ1i + |ψ2i]

at real and complex energies, respectively. Here G(l)
the resolvent of the channel long-ranged Hamiltonian

α is

H (l)

α = H (l) + v(s)
α ,

α (z) = (z − H (l)

α )−1. Merkuriev has proved that Eqs.
G(l)
(12-14) possess compact kernels, and this property re-
mains valid also for complex energies z = E−iΓ/2, Γ > 0.
In atomic three-particle systems the sign of the charge
of two particles are always identical. Let us denote them
by 1 and 2, and the non-identical one by 3. In this case

(15)

2

|ψ1i = G(l)
|ψ2i = G(l)

1 v(s)
2 v(s)

1 |ψ2i
2 |ψ1i.

Further simpliﬁcation can be achieved if the particles 1
and 2 are identical. Then, the Faddeev components |ψ1i
and |ψ2i, in their own natural Jacobi coordinates, have
the same functional form

hx1y1|ψ1i = hx2y2|ψ2i = hxy|ψi.

(20)

Therefore we can determine |ψi from the ﬁrst equation
only

|ψi = G(l)

1 v(s)

1 pP|ψi,

(21)

where P is the operator for the permutation of indexes
1 and 2 and p = ±1 are eigenvalues of P. We note that
although this integral equation has only one component
yet gives full account on asymptotic and symmetry prop-
erties of the system.

III. SOLUTION METHOD

We solve these integral equations by using the
Coulomb–Sturmian separable expansion approach [6].
The Coulomb-Sturmian (CS) functions are deﬁned by

hr|nli =

1/2

n!
(n + 2l + 1)! (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(2br)l+1 exp(−br)L2l+1

(2br),

n

(22)

with n and l being the radial and orbital angular mo-
mentum quantum numbers, respectively, and b is the
size parameter of the basis. The CS functions {|nli}
form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two-
body Hilbert space; the biorthogonal partner deﬁned by
hr|
nli = hr|nli/r. Since the three-body Hilbert space is a
direct product of two-body Hilbert spaces an appropriate
basis can be deﬁned as the angular momentum coupled
direct product of the two-body bases

e

|nνlλiα = |nliα ⊗ |νλiα,

(n, ν = 0, 1, 2, . . . ),

(23)

where |nliα and |νλiα are associated with the coordinates
xα and yα, respectively. With this basis the complete-
ness relation takes the form (with angular momentum
summation implicitly included)

where G(l)
exists if and only if

lies on the square integrable property of the terms like

diﬀerent two-body Hilbert spaces. Thus, according to
the convolution theorem the three-body Green’s oper-

The contour C should be taken counterclockwise around
the continuous spectrum of hy1 such a way that gx1 is
analytic on the domain encircled by C.

To examine the structure of the integrand let us shift
the spectrum of gx1 by taking z = E + iε with positive ε.
By doing so, the two spectra become well separated and
the spectrum of gy1 can be encircled. Next the contour
C is deformed analytically in such a way that the upper
part descends to the unphysical Riemann sheet of gy1,
while the lower part of C can be detoured away from the

avoids the singularities of gx1. Moreover, by continuing
to negative values of ε, in order that we can calculate
resonances, the branch cut and pole singularities of gx1
move onto the second Riemann sheet of gy1 and, at the
same time, the branch cut of gy1 moves onto the second
Riemann sheet of gx1. Thus, the mathematical condi-
tions for the contour integral representation of
G1(z) in
Eq. (38) can be fulﬁlled also for complex energies with
negative imaginary part. In this respect there is only a
gradual diﬀerence between the bound- and resonant-state

IV. RESONANT STATES IN POSITRONIUM
IONS

−

We calculate resonant states in positronium ion with
L = 0 total angular momentum. The positronium ion,
or e−e+e−, is a three-body Coulomb system that
Ps
consists of two electrons and one positron. We calculate
its resonances by solving Eq. (21). We took x0 = 18a0,
y0 = 50a0 and ν = 2.1 as the parameters of the splitting
function, respectively.

Before presenting our ﬁnal results we demonstrate the
convergence properties of this method. In Table (I) we
show the convergence of a resonant state energy with
respect to angular momentum channels and number of
Coulomb-Sturmian basis states N in the expansion. This
table shows the accuracy and stability of our calculations.
Table (II) contains the ﬁnal results. For the low-lying
−1
resonances we used CS parameter b = 0.25a
0 , and for
−1
the high-lying states we took b = 0.15a
0 . We compare
our calculation with the result of complex scaling calcu-
lations Ref. [5]. We can report perfect agreements for the
position of the resonances, but, in most of the cases, we
got much smaller values for the width.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this article we have presented a new method for
calculating resonances in three-body Coulombic systems.
Our approach is based on the solution of the homoge-
neous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations for complex
energies. For this, being an integral equation approach,

Abstract. We provide a detailed quantum treatment of the spectral characteristics and of the dynamics of

nondispersive two-electron wave packets along the periodically driven, collinear frozen planet conﬁguration

of helium. These highly correlated, long-lived wave packets arise as a quantum manifestation of regular

islands in a mixed classical phase space, which are induced by nonlinear resonances between the external

driving and the unperturbed dynamics of the frozen-planet conﬁguration. Particular emphasis is given to

the dependence of the ionization rates of the wave packet states on the driving ﬁeld parameters and on

the quantum mechanical phase space resolution, preceded by a comparison of 1D and 3D life times of

the unperturbed frozen planet. Furthermore, we study the eﬀect of a superimposed static electric ﬁeld

component, which, on the grounds of classical considerations, is expected to stabilize the real 3D dynamics

against large (and possibly ionizing) deviations from collinearity.

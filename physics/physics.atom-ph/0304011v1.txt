Abstract. The cloud of cold atoms obtained from a magneto-optical trap is known to exhibit two types of
instabilities in the regime of high atomic densities: stochastic instabilities and deterministic instabilities.
In the present paper, the experimentally observed stochastic dynamics is described extensively. It is shown
that it exists a variety of dynamical behaviors, which diﬀer by the frequency components appearing in the
dynamics. Indeed, some instabilities exhibit only low frequency components, while in other cases, a second
time scale, corresponding to a higher frequency, appears in the motion of the center of mass of the cloud.
A one-dimensional stochastic model taking into account the shadow eﬀect is shown to be able to reproduce
the experimental behavior, linking the existence of instabilities to folded stationary solutions where noise
response is enhanced. The diﬀerent types of regimes are explained by the existence of a relaxation frequency,
which in some conditions is excited by noise.

1 Introduction

Magneto-optical traps (MOT) produce clouds of cooled
atoms at temperature as low as the µK. The achievement
of such clouds opened many perspectives, not only in the
ﬁeld of fundamental atomic physics, as e.g. in the domain
of the atomic dynamics or the quantum chaos[1], but also
leads to several potential applications, in particular the
improvement by several orders of magnitude of the atomic
clock[2]. The MOT is also the ﬁrst stage to produce lower
temperatures, in particular to obtain Bose-Einstein con-
densates [3]. Although the use of MOTs is relatively well
mastered, some details of the experimental setup remain
empirical, because of the existence in the cloud of insta-
bilities that are not well understood. Some studies showed
that when the trapping beams are misaligned, the cloud
may be spatially altered and become unstable. In partic-
ular, ring-shaped clouds and chaos have been observed,
and attributed to a vertex force [4,5]. However, the main
instabilities encountered in the experiments concern well-
aligned MOTs. In that case, the cloud, which is usually
more or less ellipsoidal, has a complex irregular shape,
with an inhomogeneous atomic density (ﬁg 1). This shape
may not be stable, and changes as a function of time: a
typical example of these instabilities is shown in ﬁg. 1.

There is a deep interest to identify the nature of these
instabilities, in the aim to control them, and possibly to
take advantage of them. To illustrate these points, let us

of the unstable atomic cloud. Snapshots are presented in the
chronological order, each one being separated by 120 ms.

remember that instabilities may originate in many mech-
anisms, which can be classiﬁed in two families: stochastic
or deterministic. In the latter, called also deterministic
chaos, the dynamics is described by a set of deterministic
equations. When the number of equations is small (low-
dimensional deterministic chaos), it has been shown that
the dynamics can be controlled to reach various states
that are not accessible otherwise, as unstable states[6] or
periodic behaviors[7]. It is also well known that the de-
scription of such a dynamics gives access to numerous pa-
rameters, which are not measurable when the behavior
is stationary[8]. The cost for these informations is that
there is no other way to reduce the instabilities. On the
contrary, if the origin of the instabilities is stochastic, i.e.
due to external noise, a reduction of instabilities is ob-
tained by reducing the noise, but the instabilities have no
physical meaning, in that sense that they are not intrinsic
to the physics of the system.

Daniel Hennequin: Stochastic dynamics of the magneto-optical trap

In [9], a ﬁrst type of instabilities, arising for low beam
intensities, has been depicted. It was showed that these
so-called “stochastic instabilities” are induced by the ab-
sorption of the trapping beams in the cloud. A model tak-
ing into account this so-called shadow eﬀect showed that
from a dynamical point of view, instabilities arise through
a stochastic resonancelike phenomenon, namely the coher-
ent resonance, linked to a Hopf bifurcation in the station-
ary solutions of the MOT. It is well known that such a
bifurcation usually leads to periodic instabilities, and in-
deed, a recent study evidenced such instabilities, purely
deterministic [10]. However, a correct description of these
self-oscillations required to modify the model in [9], in par-
ticular to take into account the spatial distribution of the
cloud.

In the present paper, the results presented in [9] are
detailed, and extended to a larger range of parameters,
where new regimes appear, in particular a behavior with-
out resonance frequency, contrary to the instabilities de-
scribed in [9]. Then the modiﬁed model introduced in [10]
is accurately described, and the relative domains of ap-
pearance of stochastic and deterministic instabilities are
discussed. The diﬀerence appears to be the result of the
preeminent role of noise in some parameter range, in par-
ticular in the vicinity of the bifurcations. The stochastic
instabilities predicted by the model are studied, and they
are shown to be in agreement with those experimentally
observed. In particular, an interpretation of the two types
of stochastic instabilities, with and without resonance fre-
quency, is found.

The paper is organized as follows. After this introduc-
tion, the section 2 describes the experimental setup. Then,
a detailed analysis of the experimental observations of the
stochastic instabilities is presented (section 3), showing in
particular the existence of two types of instabilities. Sec-
tion 4 is devoted to the construction of a simple 1D model,
already presented in [10] in a less detailed way. In section
5, the stationary solutions of the model are discussed. Fi-
nally, in section 6, the noise induced dynamics instabilities
is studied and compared to the experimental observations.

2 Experimental set-up

We work with a Cesium-atom MOT in the usual σ+ − σ−
conﬁguration, with three arms of two counter-propagating
beams obtained from the same laser diode. The waist
wT of the trap beams may be varied from typically 3 to
10 mm. Two conﬁgurations are possible: in the ﬁrst one,
all six beams are independent, by opposition to the sec-
ond conﬁguration, where counter-propagating beams re-
sult from the reﬂection of the three forward beams. In
the last case, the intensity asymmetry resulting from the
absorption of the forward beam by the cloud, generates
a center-of-mass motion, while in the ﬁrst case, instabili-
ties are characterized by symmetrical bursts on the cloud
shape, much more diﬃcult to measure. However, as the
nonlinearities involved in both cases are the same, we ex-
pect that the dynamics will be fundamentally of the same

nature, and thus we choose the conﬁguration with retro-
reﬂected beams.

A full description of the unstable dynamics of the atomic

cloud will be presented in the next section. However, to
make easier the understanding of this paragraph, let us
depict them brieﬂy. As shown in the introduction (ﬁg. 1),
instabilities consist in a deformation of the spatial atomic
distribution, leading to ﬂuctuations of the shape of the
cloud. Therefore, the relevant dynamical variables allow-
ing us to describe instabilities, could be the shape of the
cloud (i.e. for example the local velocities and atomic den-
sities in the cloud). This type of description corresponds to
a high dimensional model, associated with partial diﬀeren-
tial equations. Here, for the sake of simplicity, we choose
to limit our description to the center of mass (CM) lo-
cation r, and the total number of atoms n in the atomic
cloud. This allows us to model the system with ordinary
diﬀerential equations, and reduces the dimension to seven,
and even three in a 1D model. As it is shown in the fol-
lowing, the use of this description appears to be suﬃcient
to understand the main mechanisms of the instabilities.

To measure r and n, we used two 4-quadrant photodi-
odes (4QP) forming an orthogonal dihedral and measuring
the ﬂuorescence of the cloud. The diﬀerential signal of the
4QP allows us to monitor the motion of the CM. Using
only two 4QPs does not allow us to reconstruct the actual
3D motion, but gives access to projections of this motion
on two diﬀerent axes. This prevents the measure from line-
of-sight eﬀects due to the optical thickness of the cloud.
We checked that whatever the type of dynamical behav-
ior, the motion components r recorded by both 4QP have
the same properties and are qualitatively identical. In the
following, the “CM motion” refers to a component r of
this motion recorded by one of the 4QPs. The second dy-
namical variable, namely the number of atoms inside the
cloud, is deduced from the total signal received from the
4QPs. In addition to the 4QPs, two video cameras monitor
the shape of the cloud. Because of their poor resolution as
compared with the 4QPs, the video cameras are not used
to record the dynamical variables. They have been essen-
tially used in the ﬁrst stages of the experiment, to control
that there is no discrepancy between the shape dynamics
and the CM dynamics.

Instabilities depend on the MOT parameters. Among
these parameters, some are easily controllable, and will be
referred in the following as control parameters. They are
the detuning ∆0 of the MOT, the magnetic ﬁeld gradient
G, the MOT beam intensities I1 and the repumper laser
intensity Irep. Other parameters cannot be considered as
control parameters, because they are not easily control-
lable or measurable in our experimental setup. Among
these parameters, the alignment of the MOT beams ap-
peared to be crucial in the experiment. We limit the present
study to the case where beams are aligned. When mis-
aligned, most of the dynamical characteristics of the cloud
change qualitatively [5]. The MOT beam waists play also a
main role on the dynamics, but in practice, they cannot be
changed easily independently from the other parameters,
in particular I1. However, two diﬀerent values have been

used in the experiments, and their eﬀects on the dynam-
ics are well understood. Finally, the vapor pressure in the
cell has probably also a large inﬂuence on the dynamics.
Unfortunately, this parameter is not easily measurable in
our experimental setup. Moreover, as it is shown later, it
does not appear explicitly in the model, but its impact on
the dynamics may be estimated through the equilibrium
population of the cloud. The parameter ranges explored
in the present experiment are summarized in Tab. 1.

iment. G is the magnetic ﬁeld gradient, I1 is the intensity of

is tuned to the unstable area, instabilities appear progres-
sively, and the amplitude grows until a maximum ∆rmax
at ∆0 max ≃ −1.95 (∆0 is expressed in units of the natu-
ral width Γ of the atomic transition). There is no abrupt
boundary between the stable and unstable areas: the lim-
its given below corresponds to ∆r = ∆rmax/10. In this
case, for the set of parameters of ﬁg. 2, instabilities appear
for −2.5 < ∆0 < −1.7 (for ∆0 > −1.7, the population in
the cloud vanishes). The unstable range depends on the
other parameters, such as the beam intensities, the vapor
pressure or the magnetic ﬁeld gradient. For example, for a
less populated cloud, due e.g. to a diﬀerent vapor pressure
in the cell, all other parameters being the same as previ-
ously, instabilities will appear at smaller detuning. How-
ever, whatever the parameters used in the experiments, in
the range given in Tab. 1, we have −3 . ∆0 max . −1,
and instabilities never occur on a range larger than 1.

3 Experimental results

Instabilities have been described in [9] for a given set of pa-
rameters. In the following, we extend this description for
the whole range of parameters where stochastic instabili-
ties appear. A ﬁrst fundamental control parameter is the
MOT beam intensity, whose value determines the type of
observed instabilities. At low MOT beam intensities, typ-
ically less than 10IS (IS = 1.1 mW/cm2 is the saturation
intensity), the cloud exhibits S instabilities (S stands for
Stochastic). For MOT beam intensities larger than 10IS,
C (for Cyclic) instabilities appear [10]. As the aim of the
present paper is to discuss about the stochastic instabili-
ties, we keep a detailed presentation of the deterministic
C instabilities for another paper. However, the two types
of instabilities cannot be completely separated, and the
domains of appearance of both types of instabilities will
be discussed.

As discussed above, S instabilities appear at low MOT
beam intensities, and are characterized by large ﬂuctua-
tions of the shape of the cloud appearing in a limited range
of the parameters. From the experimental point of view,
this last point is essential, because it is at the origin of the
introduction of the concept of instabilities of the MOT.
Indeed, if the noisy dynamics is the same whatever the
parameter values, it is clear that the problem becomes as
trivial as the reduction of technical noise in an experiment.
On the contrary, the motion of the MOT grows suddenly
in a narrow range of the parameters, as it is illustrated
in ﬁg. 2, where the amplitude ∆r of the r ﬂuctuations
is represented as a function of the control parameter ∆0.
Far from the unstable area, e.g. at large |∆0|, the cloud is
stable in shape and density. When the control parameter

Tab. 1.

Fig. 3 shows a typical unstable behavior of r. It ap-
pears as an erratic signal, with a ﬂat spectrum (ﬁg. 4).
Low frequency signiﬁcant components appear typically for
values smaller than νn ≈ 2 Hz (ﬁg. 4b), and the dynam-
ics is essentially along the ﬁrst bisector of the three for-
ward beams. The behavior of r and n are similar, with a
cross correlation coeﬃcient larger than 0.8. To determine
if these instabilities have a deterministic origin, several
tools are oﬀered through the nonlinear dynamical analy-
sis of the time series. As the MOT is dissipative, a de-
terministic dynamics should have an attractor, which can
be reconstructed easily for a low dimensional dynamics.
The result, not presented here, appears as a set of ran-
domly distributed points: in particular, it does not present
any ﬁne structure. Poincar´e section and 1D maps conﬁrm
this absence of order in the dynamics. This could be due
to a lack of resolution of the measures, but the general
shape of the trajectories rather suggests that the behav-
ior is stochastic (or chaotic with a high dimensional dy-
namics). Because this behavior appears to be a stochastic
dynamics with only low frequency components, it will be
referred in the following as SL instabilities.

C instabilities. These instabilities diﬀer drastically from S
ones[10]: they can be either periodic or erratic, but in both
cases, they are cyclic, and the motion amplitude is much
larger. However, as for S instabilities, C instabilities exist
in a limited range of ∆0, which value depends on the other
parameters. But it is systematically between ∆0 = −3 and
resonance, and the maximum detuning range is of the or-
der of 1.

scales are linear.

In some situations corresponding to given ranges of pa-
rameters [9], the r dynamics is altered by the appearance
of spontaneous large amplitude oscillation-like bursts. As
illustrated in ﬁg. 5, the signal inside the bursts is not pe-
riodic, although it is clearly dominated by a given fre-
quency. These bursts are relatively scarce, and the global
shape of the signal remains that of Fig. 3. The bursts
appear in fact as the most spectacular consequence of a
deeper change of the dynamics, which is the appearance
of a second characteristic time. This appears clearly in
the spectrum of r (Fig. 6a) as a peak centered at a fre-
quency νr, which depends on the parameter values, but
ranges typically between 10 and 100 Hz. The other char-
acteristics of the dynamics are not modiﬁed by the exis-
tence of bursts. In particular, the spectrum still exhibits
the low frequency component below νn, and the bursts do
not appear on the n behavior (Fig. 5b and 6b). The low
frequency component dynamics of r and the dynamics of
n remain correlated. This behavior will be referred in the
following as SH instabilities.

When the trap beam intensity I1 is increased, S insta-
bilities still exist, but they are progressively superseded by

Daniel Hennequin: Stochastic dynamics of the magneto-optical trap

5

As I1 is increased, the disappearance of S instabilities
occurs progressively, in favor of C instabilities. For inter-
mediate values of I1, both types of instabilities exist. Their
typical distribution versus ∆0 is illustrated in Fig. 7: far
from resonance, the cloud is stable; as the resonance is ap-
proached, S instabilities appear for a detuning ∆0 = ∆1.
Then C instabilities appear in ∆2 > ∆1. If the detuning is
still increased, C instabilities disappear in ∆3 at the ben-
eﬁt of a stable behavior. Finally, the cloud vanishes in ∆4.
As I1 is increased, the width δ12 = ∆2 − ∆1 decreases in
favor of the interval δ23 = ∆3 − ∆2, while the total unsta-
ble interval δ13 = ∆3 − ∆1 remains more or less constant.
When C instabilities merge for I1 = 4IS, they appear on a
narrow interval δ23 & 0. This interval increases rapidly un-
til I1 = 7.5IS and δ23 = 0.8. For I1 > 7.5IS, δ23 increases
more slowly, to reach the value of δ23 = 1 in I1 = 20IS,
where S instabilities have completely disappeared.

Fig. 7. This ﬁgure illustrates the evolution of the behavior as a
function of the detuning for I1 = 6.8 and Irep = 1.5 mW/cm2.
The full line reports the population, while the dashed lines
separate the domain of diﬀerent behaviors: st. stands for stable,
S for S instabilities and C for C instabilities.

To conclude this section, let us summarize the main
properties of the instabilities: they appear to be stochas-
tic at a time scale larger than 0.5 s. They may exhibit a
second dynamical component with time scale smaller than
10−2 s and acting only on r. The low frequency component
corresponds to a CM motion along the ﬁrst bisector of the
three forward beams. Finally, they appear only in a lim-
ited range of the parameters, suggesting a nonlinear origin
of the instabilities. This last point was also suggested by
diﬀerent tests showing that beam phase ﬂuctuations are
not at the origin of instabilities [9].

4 Model

To understand the dynamics observed in the experiments,
we build a phenomenological model taking into account
the shadow eﬀect. The aim here is not to model as ﬁnely
as possible the experimental system, but on the contrary
to make a model as simple as possible, enlightening the
fundamental mechanisms leading to the instabilities.

The model that we used here has already been de-
scribed in [10]. It is based on the shadow eﬀect induced
by the intensity gradients produced by the absorption of

the trapping laser beams in the cloud [4,11]. The shadow
eﬀect generates a force compressing the cloud. In the case
where the counter-propagating beams result from the re-
ﬂection of the three forward beams, this compression is
accompanied by a displacement of the CM along the ﬁrst
bisector of the three forward beams: indeed, the backward
beams are less intense than the forward ones because of
the absorption in the cloud, and so the latter literally push
the cloud oﬀ its equilibrium location. The main role of the
shadow eﬀect in the instabilities is suggested in the exper-
iments (i) by the observed correlation between the n and
slow CM dynamics and (ii) by the fact that the slow dy-
namical component of r displaces the cloud along the ﬁrst
bisector of the three forward beams. The fundamental role
of the shadow eﬀect in coupling the population and the
CM position of cold atom clouds was already reported in
[12]. In that experiment, bistability in the population dy-
namics was observed by perturbing the atomic cloud with
a highly-focalized laser beam, and shadow eﬀect is shown
to be the dominant nonlinearity.

We built a 1D model taking into account the shadow
eﬀect in a MOT where counter-propagating beams result
from the reﬂection of the three forward beams. As we are
interested here in the collective motion, we use as variables
the location z of the center of mass of the cloud along the
unique axis z of the system, and the number of atoms n
inside the cloud. The origin of z coincides with the “trap
center”, that is, the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the
motion of z may be described by the equation:

d2z
dt2 =

1
M

FT

(1)

where M is the mass of the cloud and FT the global
force exerted on the atoms by the two counterpropagat-
ing beams. To evaluate FT , we assume a multiple scatter-
ing regime, i.e. a constant atomic density ρ in the cloud.
The atoms are distributed between zmin and zmax, and the
quantity ∆z = zmax − zmin is the longitudinal size of the
cloud. We introduce a constant cross section S, allowing
us to connect ∆z to n:

n = ρS∆z

(2)

The repulsive force induced by the multiple scattering is
an internal force, and thus does not aﬀect directly the
center of mass motion. It is also the case for the attrac-
tive force induced by the shadow eﬀect, which acts on
FT only through the asymmetry between the forward and
backward beams. The forward beam is polarized σ+ and
has an input intensity I1. After the crossing of the cloud,
its output intensity is I2. This is also the input intensity
of the backward beam, which is polarized σ−. After the
crossing of the atomic cloud, the output intensity of the
backward beam is I3. We have obviously I1 > I2 > I3. FT
is proportional to the number of photons absorbed per
unit time, i.e. S(I1 − I2)/~ωL for the forward beam and
S(I2 − I3)/~ωL for the backward beam (~ωL is the energy
of one photon, ωL being the laser angular frequency). FT
is obtained by multiplying the diﬀerence between both

quantities by ~kL

To evaluate I2 and I3, we need to solve the propagation
equation of light inside the cloud. To simplify the calcula-
tions, we choose to model a Fg = 0 → Fe = 1 transition:
this is the simplest one leading to a magneto-Doppler ef-
fect. This choice does not allow us to reproduce the sub-
Doppler eﬀects, neither the photon redistribution between
the two waves, but as shown in [10], it allows us to explain
most of the experimental behaviors.

The z axis is chosen as quantiﬁcation axis, and we
introduce the ground state |gi and the three Zeeman sub-
levels of the excited state |e0i et |e±i. Because of the ki-
netic momentum conservation, |e0i is not coupled to the
light ﬁeld, and thus, the model is reduced to a three level
system, {|gi, |e−i, |e+i}. The interaction with light is gov-
erned by the Rabi frequency Ω± and the eﬀective detun-
ings ∆±, taking into account the Doppler et Zeeman vari-
ations:

The hamiltonian H of coupling with light may be written
as a function of ∆± and Ω± in the {|gi, |e−i, |e+i} basis:

The time scale of the internal variables is Γ −1, and
so is much shorter than that of the external variables z
and v. Thus the stationary solution of Eq. (5) can be
used. The solution for the populations of the excited states
Π± = σ±± can be obtained analytically. On the other
hand, as the redistribution of photons between the beams
is forbidden, Π± is directly proportional to the absorp-
tion rate of the beams, and the intensity gradient can be
written:

where we have introduce the population relaxation B and
the atom number in the cloud at equilibrium ne, which is
linked to the loading rate L by L = Bne. ne is assumed
to depend on the CM location, to take into account the
losses variation when the cloud moves from the trap cen-
ter. We do not know the exact form of this dependence,
because this variation may have several origins. However,
we can suppose that the main contribution comes from
the transverse distribution of the trap laser beam, which
is gaussian. For sake of simplicity, we keep only the ﬁrst
terms from its Taylor’s series, i.e. the quadratic term. In
fact, we checked that the exact dependence of ne does not
change drastically the results given below. So we write:

where n0 is the equilibrium cloud population at the trap

when n is deduced from Eq. 2.

Most of the theoretical parameters are the exact coun-
terpart of the experimental parameters, as e.g. the mag-
netic ﬁeld gradient or the beam intensities. In this case,
we used in the model the same values as those of Table 1.
It is not the case for all parameters, either because of the
simplicity of the model or because they cannot be mea-
sured easily in the experiment. For example, n0 has not a
simple experimental counterpart, but depends on several
experimental parameters, as e.g. the repumping laser in-
tensity or the vapor pressure in the cell. For this reason,
a large interval of n0 values has been used for the simu-
lations (Table 2). The density ρ and the cross sectional
area S, which play the same role, have a meaning only
in the context of a 1D model, while they correspond to
variables in the experiments. They are ﬁxed in the sim-
ulations at experimental averaged values, and they have
been varied on a wide range to check that their value is
not critical. Finally, the parameter z0 has not exact ex-
perimental counterpart, as it is linked to both the trap
beam waist and intensities. Indeed, the relevant size for
the atoms is not the beam waist, corresponding to an in-
tensity decreased by a ratio e−2 as compared to the center
of the beam, but rather the location where the local beam
intensity decreases under IS. This value is much larger
than w0 for intense beams.

In order to check if the model can be more simpliﬁed,
we tried to reproduce the unstable dynamics of the cloud
with the ﬁrst terms of the Taylor’s series of Eqs. (9a) et
(9b), but we needed to keep several orders and did not ob-
tain simpler equations. Another possible approximation
concerns the diﬀerent terms appearing in ∆±, in Eq. 4.
Using the values given in table II, one sees easily that the
∆0 term and the Zeeman shift are of the same order of

magnitude, while the Doppler shift goes to zero at equi-
librium, but can be the largest term out of equilibrium. In
these conditions, no approximation is possible. Therefore,
we use the equations (13) in the calculations.

To perform the comparison between the experiments
and the present model, we need to study the behavior of
the system when noise is added. Noise can be added in Eqs
13 on any parameter, and as we were not able in our ex-
periments to identify clearly the main source of noise, we
tried theoretically several parameters, as the beam inten-
sity I1 or the equilibrium population n0. In this case, the
stochastic model corresponds to Eqs 13 where the parame-
ter I1 (resp. n0) is replaced by (1 + ζ) I1 (resp. (1 + ζ) n0),
where ζ(t) is the noise component. We also simulated sev-
eral types of noise: gaussian white noise, but also colored
noise with diﬀerent distributions of the frequencies. All
conﬁgurations give identical results: on the one hand, the
choice of the noisy parameter is not critical; on the other
hand, the spectrum of noise does not alter the response
spectrum, except obviously that it depends on the rela-
tive weight of the diﬀerent frequencies in the noise. Thus,
for sake of clarity, all the results reported in the following
have been obtained by applying with gaussian white noise
on I1.

5 Stationary solutions

In the previous section, we built a relatively simple model
where the cloud is described by a set of three equations
that do not depend explicitly on the time. Such a sys-
tem is known to be able to exhibit a complex dynamics,
including chaos, which could explain the experimental in-
stabilities. To know if such a complex dynamics occur in
our conditions, the ﬁrst step is to evaluate the stability
of the stationary solutions. The stationary solutions (Vs,
Zs, Ns) of the model with the shadow eﬀect are easily
deduced from Eq.13 when the left side is put to zero. Eq.
13a gives immediately Vs = 0. From Eq. 13c, one ﬁnds
that the stationary solutions Zs of the CM location and
Ns of the population are linked by the simple expression:

Ns = 1 − Z 2
s

(14)

Therefore, the discussion is reduced to the analysis of Zs.
Zs is the solution of FT = 0 in Eqs 13b. This equation can
be resolved numerically: its global shape is illustrated in
Fig. 8, where it is plotted as a function of ∆0 and n0.

A ﬁrst characteristic of the Zs diagram is that Zs goes
to 1 (i.e. Ns goes to zero) at resonance. This vanishing
of the cloud, also observed in the experiments, is a well-
known consequence of the ineﬃciency of the Doppler cool-
ing close to resonance. It is here enhanced by the shadow
eﬀect and the displacement of the cloud. The disappear-
ance occurs suddenly for small n0, and becomes softer as
n0 increases. An interesting point is that for small n0, the
abrupt increase of Zs is linked to a very narrow bistable
cycle. As n0 is increased, the bistable cycle shifts towards
smaller Zs and smaller ∆0, and the vanishing of Zs be-
comes progressive.

Fig. 8. Stationary solutions of equations 13 versus n0 and ∆0.
The ﬁgure represents Zs. Other parameters correspond to the
set #1 given in table 2. The deﬁnition of the N, F, SN and SF
zones (each corresponding to diﬀerent level of greys) is given
in the text.

The main characteristic of the Zs diagram is the pres-
ence of several abrupt slope changes in the stationary solu-
tions, leading to a fold in the parameter space. The shape
of the fold depends on the parameters, in particular on
n0. Fig. 9 shows four examples corresponding to situa-
tions leading to basically diﬀerent atomic dynamics. For
n0 = 0.5×108 (ﬁg. 9a), Zs increases smoothly with ∆0 (i.e.
Ns decreases slowly). The vanishing of the cloud through
a narrow bistable cycle is not visible on the graph, as it oc-
curs closer from resonance. As n0 increases, the bistable
cycle appears for smaller Zs (and thus larger Ns), and
becomes physically signiﬁcant. Fig. 9b shows Zs for n0
= 2.5 × 108 and a bistable cycle for −0.3 . ∆0 . −0.25.
If n0 is further increased, the bistable cycle disappears,
but it remains a fold corresponding to two abrupt slope
changes of Zs versus ∆0 (ﬁg. 9c, n0 = 3.4 × 108). If n0 is
still increased, the fold remains, but it becomes smoother
(Fig. 9d for n0 = 4 × 108).

The dynamics of the cloud is determined by the stabil-
ity of these stationary solutions. In particular, if no sta-
tionary solutions are stable, complex dynamics could be
obtained. The stability of the above stationary solutions
is evaluated through a linear stability analysis, which as-
sociates to each stationary solution its three eigenvalues,
corresponding to the stability following its three eigendi-
rections in the 3D phase space of our model. The real part
of the eigenvalue, corresponding to a damping rate, de-
termines the stability (stable if negative). The imaginary
part, when diﬀerent from zero, is associated to an angu-
lar eigenfrequency, also called relaxation frequency, which
play a main role in the dynamics. A pleasant – and simple
– way to describe the stationary solutions is to use their
phase space representation, where each stationary solution
corresponds to a ﬁxed point with its properties depend-
ing on its eigenvalues. Let us remember that the standard
terminology distinguishes the stable node (all eigenvalues
real and negative), the stable focus (all real parts negative,
two eigenvalues complex conjugate), the saddle node (all

tionary solution Zs of equations 13. The full (resp. dashed)
line corresponds to a stable (resp. unstable) solution. In (a),

(d), n0 = 4 × 108 Other parameters correspond to the set #1

eigenvalues real, at least one positive) and the saddle focus
(at least one real part positive, two eigenvalues complex
conjugate). For sake of simplicity, this terminology will be
used in the following.

The set of points of vertical tangency in Zs determines
a line which delimits the unstable stationary solution of
the medium branch of the bistability cycle. Linear stabil-
ity analysis shows that the ﬁxed point in that area is a
saddle-node with real eigenvalues, two being positive and
one negative. But the unstable stationary solutions extend
beyond this area. In particular, the stationary solutions
can also be unstable on a part of the upper branch of the
bistable cycle, and even outside the bistable cycle, when
the stationary solution is unique. This is illustrated on ﬁg.
8 where the nature of the stationary solution is indicated
by a level of gray and a code. In the SN zone, the ﬁxed
point associated with the stationary solution is a saddle
node, i.e. the stationary solution is unstable, and its three
eigenvalues are real, two being positive. In the SF zone,
the ﬁxed point is a saddle focus, i.e. the stationary solu-
tion is unstable, and two of its eigenvalues are complex
with a positive real part, and the third one is real nega-
tive. In the F zone, the ﬁxed point is a stable focus, i.e.
the stationary solution is stable, and two of its eigenval-
ues are complex with a negative real part, the third one
is real negative. Finally, in the N zone, the ﬁxed point is
a stable node, i.e. the stationary solution is stable and all
eigenvalues are real negative. The dashed line indicates the
location of the bifurcation, i.e. the transition from stable
to unstable stationary solutions. In most cases, it occurs
from stable focus to saddle focus, through a super-critical
Hopf bifurcation.

As the detuning is varied, four typical situations may
occur, already illustrated in Fig. 9. For small n0 (Fig. 9a),
Zs is always stable, and its dependence versus ∆0 is al-
most ﬂat (except very close from resonance): we expect

Daniel Hennequin: Stochastic dynamics of the magneto-optical trap

a stationary cloud slightly moving with the detuning. In
the bistability area (Fig. 9b), the central branch of the
bistability cycle is unstable, as usual in such a situation,
but the upper branch is also partly unstable, reducing
drastically the parameter range where the system is ef-
fectively bistable. However, a narrow bistable zone should
be observed. As n0 is still increased, only one stationary
solution remains (Figs 9c), which is unstable on the fold.
Finally, for large n0 (Fig. 9d), the solution is always
stable (F zone), except very close from resonance. Thus
we expect to observe a stationary cloud moving with ∆0.
However, because of the fold, this moving is non linear,
and on the fold, for −0.45 < ∆0 < −0.35, ZS is more
sensitive to the ∆0 value, because the slope here is larger.
On the other hand, a closer look to the eigenvalues (Fig.
10) shows that at the level of the fold, the real part λ of
the complex eigenvalues λ ± iω is close to zero, while the
eigenfrequency crosses a minimum. This is more evident
on Fig. 11, where the same situation is illustrated for a
diﬀerent set of parameters. The vanishing damping rate
|λ| associated to an increased sensitivity to the parameter
values means that a small perturbation will cause a large
undamped reaction of the system, with relaxation oscil-
lations at a frequency ω crossing a minimum while ∆0
is varied on the fold. In the fold inﬂection point, where
the slope is maximum, the eigenfrequency and damping
rate are minimum: the eﬀects of perturbations is expected
to be maximum at this point. Note that the evolution of
λ and ω around the inﬂection point is asymmetric: the
damping rate and relaxation frequency increase rapidly
for detunings smaller than the inﬂection point, while they
remain of the same order of magnitude on the other side.
This asymmetry is expected to have consequences on the
dynamics.

Fig. 11. Same as Fig. 10 for parameter set #2 of Table 2. For
sake of clarity, the evolution of λ has been truncated for small
detunings, where it becomes almost linear, reaching e.g. the
value of λ = −1500 for ∆0 = −0.3.

instabilities cannot occur. However, the presence of the
fold and the proximity of a Hopf bifurcation generate a
type of stochastic behavior similar to instabilities[9].

Indeed, on the one hand, the proximity of a Hopf bi-
furcation is known to favor the appearance of coherence
resonance[16], as discussed in [9]. Let us recall that coher-
ence resonance is the counterpart of stochastic resonance
in autonomous systems[15]. Stochastic resonance appears
in some forced systems: it may be seen as an ampliﬁca-
tion by noise of the system response to a forcing. In other
terms, the signal to noise ratio of the output periodic sig-
nal resulting from the modulation exhibits a maximum
when the noise amplitude increases. In stable autonomous
systems, the behavior is not periodic, but a phenomenon
similar to stochastic resonance can lead to an ampliﬁca-
tion of an internal resonance: it is the internal stochastic
resonance, or coherent resonance [17,18]. Coherent reso-
nance is also known to generate noise induced coherent
oscillations, which explain some of our experimental ob-
servations, as shown in [9].

On the other hand, as shown above, the particular con-
ﬁguration of the eigenvalues on the stable fold makes the
system very sensitive to small perturbations, i.e. to noise,
and thus we expect a large increasing of the response to
noise on the fold. The resulting behavior looks like in-
stabilities, whereas it is simply noise ampliﬁcation. The
behavior obtained on the stable fold when noise is taken
into account is detailed in the next section.

Fig. 10. Evolution as a function of the detuning of the station-
ary solution ZS and its eigenvalues, for the parameters of Fig.
9d. The stationary solution is given through the full bold line
in the upper side of the ﬁgure. The dashed line noted ω repre-
sents the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues, while the
full line corresponds to their real part λ. The third eigenvalue
is always real negative, almost constant and everywhere larger
than λ. It cannot be distinguished from the zero axis at the
scale of the ﬁgure.

Deterministic instabilities are expected to occur for pa-
rameters where all stationary solutions are unstable, i.e.
in the SF monostable zone[10]. In all other areas, the sta-
tionary solutions are stable, and therefore, deterministic

6 The stable fold: stochastic instabilities

In [10], it has been shown that the model is able to repro-
duce the C instabilities, in the monostable SF zone. On
the contrary, S instabilities do not appear in this situa-
tion. In fact, it has been shown in [9] that S instabilities
are not instabilities in the usual signiﬁcance, but the re-
sult of the ampliﬁcation of the system intrinsic noise, and
thus it is necessary to add noise in the simulations to ob-
serve S instabilities. This dynamics could appear when the
stationary solution of the MOT is not stable, but would
be diﬃcult to analyze, because in this case the resulting
dynamics would be the superimposition of the determinis-
tic instability with the stochastic motion, the latter being

10

masked by the former. For this reason, the present sec-
tion is devoted to the study of the inﬂuence of noise on
the stable stationary solutions of the model, in particular
in the vicinity of the fold. As the model here is slightly
diﬀerent from that used in [9], we could expect diﬀerent
results from those obtained in [9]. It is shown in the fol-
lowing that the modiﬁcations introduced in the model do
not alter the previous conclusions, i.e. that S instabilities
are produced by noise ampliﬁcation on the fold.

To evaluate the response of the system to noise in the
vicinity of the fold, we have plotted the amplitude of the
motion perturbed by noise, versus the detuning, across the
fold (Fig. 12). The amplitude of the motion is measured
through the standard deviation σ of Z. Fig. 12 has been
obtained for a gaussian white noise applied on I1 with an
amplitude of 10−3, in a situation where the stationary so-
lutions are stable on the fold. Noise ampliﬁcation appears
clearly on the fold, and mimics instabilities, as in the ex-
periments (Fig. 2). The maximum of the motion ampli-
tude, obtained for ∆0 = −0.23, corresponds to a standard
deviation of 1.1 × 10−3, i.e. 33 µm, in good agreement
with the experimental value. By comparison, the motion
amplitude is 0.036 for ∆0 = −3, i.e. the eﬀect of noise is
30 times larger on the fold than in ∆0 = −3. Note that, as
similar motion amplitudes are obtained in the experiment
and in the model for a noise level ζ = 10−3, this gives us
in return an evaluation of the experimental noise level.

i.e. much smaller than the experimental range, which was
typically of the order of 1. However, the width of the slope
is very dependent on the MOT parameters: for example,
on Fig. 10, where I1 and n0 are diﬀerent, the fold is more
than twice larger than in the present case. Thus there is
no doubt that it is possible to ﬁnd a parameter set giv-
ing a correct fold width. However, because of the extreme
simplicity of the model as compared to the experiments,
such a search has no meaning: the aim here is just to show
that very few ingredients, including the shadow eﬀect and
the noise, are able to reproduce the global experimental
behavior. We have now demonstrated that the noise re-
sponse can eﬀectively have the appearance of instabilities
for some parameters. We will now examine in detail the
resulting dynamics, and compare it to the experimental
observations.

Fig. 13 shows the time evolution of Z and N in ∆0 =
−0.23, where the ampliﬁcation is maximum. The signal
is of course stochastic, but several diﬀerences appear, on
the one hand between the cloud response and the applied
noise, and on the other hand between the Z and N evo-
lutions. Indeed, while the applied noise is white, a fre-
quency dominates in the response, in particular for Z.
This is clearly visible on the signal, and of course on the
spectrum (Fig. 14), where a peak appears at a frequency
ωS ≃ 38 Hz. For N , while the frequency ωS still appears,
low frequency ﬂuctuations dominates, as it is also shown
by the spectrum (Fig. 14). This behavior with two diﬀer-
ent characteristic times is very similar to the experimental
SH behavior illustrated in the Fig. 6: in both cases, the
higher frequency component dominates the motion of the
atoms, while the number of atoms in the cloud is mainly
driven by the low frequency component.

Thus, as for the model developed in [9], the fold plays
the role of a noise ampliﬁer, leading to an unstable cloud
over a limited range of the parameters. The maximum of
the motion amplitude appears at the fold inﬂection point.
The amplitude decreases progressively and quasi symmet-
rically on each side of this point, in spite of the asymme-
try of the eigenvalues discussed in the previous section.
The range where the instabilities can be observed, ap-
pears to be of the order of the “width” of the fold, that

slope changes delimiting the fold (a more precise deﬁni-
tion could be given, but is not useful for the following).

In the experiments, the origin of the higher frequency
was not identiﬁed, as it does not correspond to a known
experimental characteristic frequency. However, we know
now that the stable stationary solution on the fold has
complex eigenvalues, and thus is associated with a relax-
ation frequency. As noise is known to be able to excite such
non linear resonance eigenfrequencies[19], it is interesting
to compare in the simulations the frequency appearing in
the dynamics with the eigenfrequency of the stationary
solution. This is illustrated on Fig. 15 for diﬀerent values
of the detuning. The full and dashed lines concern the sta-
tionary solutions: they shows the evolution of ω and ZS
versus ∆0. They are a reproduction of Fig. 11, and are re-
called just for comparison. The squares give the resonance
frequencies of the noisy dynamics. They are obtained by
ﬁtting the calculated spectra of Z, as illustrated on Fig.
14a, with a lorentzian function. Similar ﬁts on the N spec-
tra give the same results. Fig. 15 shows that for detunings
larger than the fold inﬂection point, the noisy resonance
frequency and the eigenfrequency correspond exactly. This
conﬁrms that the frequency appearing in the dynamics is
the relaxation frequency appearing in the eigenvalues as-
sociated with the stationary solution. Thus “instabilities”
appear in fact as a noisy ampliﬁcation of the relaxation
frequency of the MOT, through a phenomenon already
observed in many other systems, as e.g. in lasers [19]: the
small damping rate allows noise to excite the relaxation
frequency, altering the frequency distribution of the sys-
tem response to noise.

For detunings smaller than the fold inﬂection point,
Fig. 15 exhibits diﬀerences between the eigenfrequencies
and the resonance frequencies. A close look at the dynam-
ics of the cloud shows that the main point is not this dif-

Fig. 15. Evolution of the resonance frequencies as a function
of the detuning. The full and dashed line recalls the evolution

ﬁg. 14. The bars give the width of the lorentzian.

ference, but a dramatic broadening of the noise resonance,
leading to an indetermination of the resonant frequency.
This is illustrated on Fig. 15, where the bars associated
with each point have a height of ∆ν, the width of the
lorentzian peak obtained by ﬁtting the Z spectrum. On
the inﬂection point, the resonance is narrow, as it appears
on Fig. 14. On the right of the inﬂection point, the reso-
nance remains narrow, reaching a maximum of ∆ν = 14
Hz in ∆0 = −0.2. On the contrary, for detunings smaller
than the inﬂection point, ∆ν increases rapidly, reaching
already the value ∆ν = 30 Hz in ∆0 = −0.235 (the in-
ﬂection point is in ∆0 = −0.23). It is clear on Fig. 15
that the discrepancy between the noise resonance and the
relaxation frequencies is linked to the width of the reso-
nance: as the resonance broadens, it also ﬂattens, and the
central frequency becomes irrelevant. This is the reason
why the resonant frequencies for detunings smaller than
∆0 = −0.26 are not reported on the ﬁgure.

This asymmetry in the dynamics around the fold in-
ﬂection point is of course linked to the asymmetry in the
eigenvalues associated with the stationary solution. For
detunings larger than the inﬂection point, the damping
rate remains small (less than 45 s−1), and thus the noise
excitation of the relaxation oscillations remains eﬃcient.
On the contrary, for detunings smaller than the inﬂec-
tion point, the damping rate increases rapidly, decreasing
the eﬃciency of the excitation, and leading to a ﬂat reso-
nance. The consequence on the dynamics is illustrated on
Fig. 16, where the power spectra of the Z dynamics are
represented for two diﬀerent values of the detuning, lo-
cated symmetrically with respect to the inﬂection point.
In (a), for ∆0 = −0.22, i.e. for a larger detuning than
the inﬂection point, the resonance, centered on 50 Hz, re-
mains narrow (∆ν = 11 Hz), and thus signiﬁcant. In (b),
for ∆0 = −0.24, i.e. on the other side of the inﬂection
point, the resonance, centered on 100 Hz, is already 60 Hz
wide, and also ﬁve times lower (note the diﬀerent vertical

niﬁcant from an experimental point of view: indeed, the
experimental dynamics is analyzed from time series with
a necessary limited number of points, leading to spectra
with a resolution much smaller than in the simulations. It
is clear that a resonance as those observed on the left of the
inﬂection point could not be detected in the experiments,
and thus one expects that in this situation, experiments
deliver non resolved spectra. It was eﬀectively the case for
SL instabilities (Fig. 4), and thus we can conclude that the
SL dynamics observed in the experiments is also explained
by the present model.

The results obtained in this section can be summa-
rized in the following way: when the parameters of the
cloud are such that the unique stationary solution is sta-
ble, and therefore that no deterministic instabilities can
occur, the action of noise mimics instabilities. This origi-
nates in a fold of the stationary solution, which plays the
role of a noise ampliﬁer. Moreover, the particular prop-
erties of the eigenvalues associated with the stationary
solutions on the fold – small damping rate and relaxation
frequency – lead to the existence of the stochastic regime:
for detuning larger than the fold inﬂection point, a reso-
nance is excited by the noise, leading to a dynamics with
a dominating frequency; for detuning smaller than the in-
ﬂection point, the damping rate increases, and the reso-
nance vanishes. This allows us to interpret all the regimes
observed experimentally.

The particular properties of the eigenvalues discussed
above are in fact linked to the proximity of a Hopf bifur-
cation. Another known consequence of such a situation is
to favor the existence of coherence resonance, and such a
phenomenon exists eﬀectively in our case [9]. Now, an in-
teresting question is to determine what are the exact con-
nections between all these phenomena, and in particular
if the existence of coherence resonance has a determining
role in that of instabilities. The answer is obviously: no!
Indeed, the essential ingredient for noise ampliﬁcation is
the fold; the properties of the eigenvalues only determine
the time characteristics of the dynamics. In particular, we
have checked that with the present model, no coherence
resonance occurs when the MOT exhibits SL instabilities.

7 Conclusion

It has been shown recently that the cloud of cold atoms
obtained from a magneto-optical trap may exhibit a com-
plex dynamics in the regime of high atomic densities. The
observed behaviors can be essentially separated in two dif-
ferent types, depending of their nature: stochastic insta-
bilities [9] or deterministic instabilities[10]. The aim of this
paper was to describe extensively the experimentally ob-
served stochastic dynamics, and to understand its mech-
anisms, through a model brieﬂy presented in [10] and de-
tailed here.

A detailed analysis of the experimental results in the
stochastic regime shows a variety of dynamical behaviors,
which diﬀer by the frequency components appearing in
the dynamics. Indeed, some instabilities exhibit only low
frequency components, while in other cases, a second time
scale, corresponding to a higher frequency, appears in the
motion of the center of mass of the cloud.

The simple stochastic 1D-model that we use here al-
lows us to retrieve and interpret these experimental dy-
namics. The model shows that the existence of instabil-
ities is linked to folded stationary solutions where noise
response is enhanced. Moreover, the proximity of a Hopf
bifurcation and the resulting conditions on the stability
of the stationary solutions – small damping rate and ex-
istence of a relaxation frequency – explains the existence
of several types of regimes: indeed, depending on the pa-
rameters, noise is sometimes able to excite the relaxation
frequency, leading to the appearance of the second time
scale in the dynamics. Globally, the agreement between
this over-simpliﬁed 1D model and the 3D experiments is
surprisingly good. Not only it allows us to make a qualita-
tive interpretation of the experimentally observed dynam-
ics, but also gives quantitative results compatible with the
experimental measures, in particular concerning the am-
plitude of the instabilities. However, it is clear that a 3D
model is necessary for an accurate quantitative description
of all the experimental observations.

The model also emphasized the close relations between
the stochastic and deterministic instabilities. Indeed, both
types of dynamics appear to be link to the same factors:
the eﬀective dynamics depends mainly on the distance be-
tween the working point and the bistable cycles (or the

Hopf bifurcation). In fact, the dynamics described in the
present paper appears as the ﬁrst sign of the deterministic
instabilities described in [10], and thus may be considered
as a noisy precursor to deterministic instabilities[8,20]. A
study of the phenomenon from this point of view should
put in evidence new properties of these instabilities.

We report an optical dipole trap for calcium. The trap is created by focusing a 488 nm argon-ion
laser beam into a calcium magneto-optical trap. The argon-ion laser photo-ionizes atoms in the trap
because of a near-resonance with the 4s4f 1F3 level. By measuring the dipole trap decay rate as
a function of argon-ion laser intensity, we determine the 1F3 photo-ionization cross section at our
wavelength to be approximately 230 Mb.

INTRODUCTION

Laser-cooling experiments have expanded in recent
years to group II metals. This is partially due to a grow-
ing interest in optical frequency standards [1–3]. Cal-
cium, strontium, and ytterbium all have narrow reso-
nances from the ground state at relatively convenient
laser wavelengths. The major isotopes of these ele-
ments have no angular momentum in the ground state,
making the narrow “clock” transition frequencies less
sensitive to external ﬁelds. Other experiments, such
as metastable collision studies, photo-associative spec-
troscopy and quasi-molecule formation, Bose-Einstein
condensation in simple atomic systems, and ultracold
plasma investigations also contribute to the growing in-
terest in laser-cooling alkaline-earth metals.

Only a few experiments have explored optical dipole
traps for alkaline-earth atoms. The absence of an-
gular momentum in the ground state prevents sub-
Doppler cooling using resonance transitions [4], compli-
cating dipole trap loading. However, advanced cooling
techniques can reduce the atomic temperature to a few
microKelvin, and dipole traps in Sr [5, 6] and Yb [7, 8]
have been reported.

In this paper we report an optical dipole trap for cal-
cium. Our trap captures T ∼ 1 mK atoms in the excited
4s3d 1D2 metastable state. Because the atomic temper-
ature is relatively high, the dipole trap operates in the
regime where the light-shift is several times larger than
the natural atomic transition linewidth [9]. The high
intensities required to capture these atoms is also high
enough to photo-ionize them. By measuring the photo-
ionization production rate and the trap lifetime as a func-
tion of dipole trap laser intensity, we determine the ef-
fective 1D2 lifetime in our system and photon-ionization
cross section.

II. MAGNETO-OPTICAL TRAP

The calcium MOT is formed by three pairs of counter-
propagating laser beams that intersect at right angles in
the center of a magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld [10]. The 423
nm laser light required for the calcium MOT is gener-
ated by frequency-doubling an infrared laser in KNbO3,
and has been described previously [11]. A diode laser
master-oscillator-power-ampliﬁer (MOPA) system deliv-
ers 300 mW single frequency at 846 nm, as shown in Fig.
1. This laser is phase-locked to a build-up cavity using
the Pound-Drever-Hall technique [12], giving a power en-
hancement of 30. A 10mm long a-cut KNbO3 crystal in
the small waist of the build-up cavity is used to generate
45 mW output power at 423 nm via non-critical phase
matching at a temperature of −12o C [11].

The laser is further stabilized by locking the 423 nm
light to the calcium resonance transition using saturated
absorption spectroscopy in a calcium vapor cell [13]. An
acousto-optic modulator (AOM) in one arm of the sat-
urated absorption laser beams shifts the laser frequency
so that the laser beam sent to the MOT is 35 MHz (one
natural linewidth) below the atomic resonance. We also
use the AOM to chop this beam and use a lock-in am-
pliﬁer to eliminate the Doppler background in the sat-
urated absorption signal. Because the 846 nm laser is

already locked to the frequency-doubling cavity, the feed-
back from this second lock circuit servos the frequency-
doubling cavity length.

The trap is loaded from a thermal beam of calcium
atoms that passes through the center of the MOT. The
thermal beam is formed by heating calcium in a stainless
steel oven to 650o C. The beam is weakly collimated by
the 1mm diameter, 10mm long aperture in the oven wall.
As the beam passes through the MOT, the slowest atoms
in the velocity distribution are cooled and trapped. An
additional red-detuned (140 MHz, or four times the nat-
ural linewidth) laser beam counter-propagates the cal-
cium atomic beam, signiﬁcantly enhancing the MOT’s
capture eﬃciency. The density proﬁle of the MOT is ap-
proximately Gaussian, with a 1/e2-radius of 0.5 mm and
a peak density of 109 cm−3. The lifetime of the MOT
is limited by optical pumping to the 4s3d 1D2 state (see
Fig. 2).

III. OPTICAL DIPOLE TRAP

The dipole trap is formed by focusing a 488 nm argon-
ion laser beam in the center of the MOT. The interaction
of the laser beam with the atoms is easily described in
terms of the AC-Stark shift. The electric ﬁeld of the laser
beam ~E induces a polarization ~P in the atom. The inter-
action of these two ﬁelds gives rise to the − ~P · ~E potential.
A rotating wave approximation of this interaction leads
to the well-known optical potential or “light shift”:

where ~ is Planck’s constant divided by 2π, γ = τ −1 is 2π
times the natural line width, and Is = πhcγ/3λ3 is the
saturation intensity, c is the speed of light, λ is the wave-
length of the atomic transition, ∆ = ω − ω0 is the detun-
ing of the laser ω from the atomic transition ω0 in rad/s,
and I(r) is the intensity of the laser beam. For multi-level
atoms with many transitions from a given state, the light
shift calculation in Eq. 1 is extended by summing contri-
butions from all of the transitions connected to the level,
replacing γ with the appropriate Einstein-A coeﬃcients.
We use the data tabulated in Refs. [14, 15] .

The 488 nm argon-ion laser wavelength is near-
resonant with the 4s3d 1D2 − 4s4f 1F3 transition (∆ =
2πc(1/487.9863nm−1/487.8126nm) = −1.38×1012). For
a 1 W laser beam focused to a 20µm Gaussian waist, the
optical potential depth is U/kB = 11.6 mK. Such a deep
potential is required to trap our relatively hot calcium
atoms. The atomic temperature is near the Doppler limit
of laser cooling using the 423 nm transition.

Dipole traps for heavier group II atoms have been
reported. Those experiments cooled on the intercom-
bination lines, which has a much lower Doppler limit.
This could be done in calcium, especially in conjunction
with quenched cooling [16, 17] or two-photon cooling [18].

edge.

IV. DIPOLE TRAP LOADING

We load the dipole trap while the MOT light is on.
The dipole trap ﬁlls up with atoms optically pumped into
the 1D2 state in the region of the 488 nm laser beam
focus. Other 1D2 atoms from outside the focal region
pass through the dipole trap, but there is no dissipative
cooling mechanism to capture them.

Some of the 1D2 atoms are ionized by the 488 nm
laser beam via a two-photon transition to the continuum.
This photo-ionization pathway is enhanced by a near-
resonance with the 1F3 level. As discussed below, it is
probably further enhanced by a near-resonance in the
Rydberg series leading up to the Ca II 3d ionization limit.
We measure the ion production rate for diﬀerent 488
nm laser beam intensities [19]. Sample data is plotted in
Fig. 3(a). This data is re-plotted in Fig. 3(b) with the
ion production rate divided by the laser power squared.
This ratio is proportional to the number of 1D2 atoms in
the laser focus, and in the absence of a dipole trap, this
signal should be a ﬂat line. At low powers, the number
of atoms in the dipole trap increases as the trap depth
increases. The trap number maximizes when the average
well depth is a few times the Doppler temperature. At
higher power, the trap number fall oﬀ because the 488
nm laser beam shifts the 4s2 1S0 and 4s4p 1P1 levels
out of resonance with the MOT laser, reducing the eﬃ-
ciency of the optical pumping loading mechanism. We
performed a Monte-Carlo simulation of trap loading and
found agreement with our data, as plotted in Fig. 3a.

At higher laser powers, the ion production rate is some-
what higher than expected. This occurs when the light-
shift of the 1S0 and 1P1 levels due to the 488 nm laser
beam exceeds the natural linewidth. This is precisely
the condition under which ground-state atoms can be
captured in the dipole trap. Such an arrangement would
increase the density of ground-state atoms, making the

measurements made with diﬀerent intracavity laser apertures.
The lower panel (b) plots the ion count rate divided by the
square of the laser power, which is proportional to the number
of 1D2 atoms in the dipole trap. The solid line is a ﬁt of our

loading rate due to optical pumping higher at higher pow-
ers.

We can estimate the number of 1D2 atoms in our dipole
trap using a simple rate equation. For deep optical po-
tentials in steady state conditions, this is equal to the
trap loading rate multiplied by the trap lifetime. The
loading rate is equal to the optical pumping rate multi-
plied by the dipole trap volume, and divided by the MOT
volume. Because the confocal parameter of the 488 nm
laser beam exceeds the MOT dimension, and because the
dipole trap oscillation period along the symmetry axis is
long compared to the 1D2 lifetime, we can assume that
the volume ratio is just the square of the laser beam waist
divided by the square of the Gaussian size of the MOT
cloud. The number of 1D2 atoms in the dipole trap, ND,
can be written as

s/2

ND =

1 + s + (4π∆/γ)2 τeﬀANS (cid:18)

where s = I/Is is the saturation parameter, NS is the
number of ground state atoms in the trap, τeﬀ is the
dipole trap lifetime, A = 2150 s−1 is the Einstein A co-
eﬃcient for the 1P1 −1 D2 transition, and r0 is the Gaus-
sian 1/e2 radius of the MOT. Depending on the beam
waist and laser power, this simple model tells us that
we load up to 2000 atoms into the trap, for a peak den-
sity of approximately 5 × 108 cm−3. By comparison, the
background density of 1D2 atoms is given by Eq. 2 with-
out the volume ratio, and with the numbers ND and NS

replaced by densities. The 1D2 background density is
∼ 107 cm−3.

In view of these numbers,

it is perhaps surprising
that at the lowest laser powers we can detect a small
number of atoms in the dipole trap, and discriminate
against the background 1D2 atoms. But the background
atoms roll through the trap in a few µs, and the trapped
atoms remain in the trap approximately 100 times longer.
The photo-ionization probability increases with the time
spent in the 488 nm laser focus, so the ionization signal
is predominantly from the trapped atoms.

V. TWO-PHOTON PHOTOIONIZATION RATE

We measure the lifetime of the dipole trap by block-
ing the MOT laser beams, and measuring the decay of
the ion signal. The three most important decay mech-
anisms are radiative decay of the 1D2 level, collisional
decay due to hot atoms from the thermal atomic beam,
and two-photon ionization of the 1D2 atoms. Because we
do not have a suitable method for turning oﬀ the ther-
mal beam, we cannot reliably extract the 1D2 radiative
lifetime. Published values of the lifetime are around 2 ms
[20–24], somewhat longer than measured in our experi-
ment. While our experiment cannot determine the radia-
tive lifetime, by measuring the decay rate as a function
of 488 nm laser intensity we can determine the photo-
ionization cross-section.

after the loading has turned oﬀ is

In second-order perturbation theory, two-photon ion-
ization is written as an overlap of the initial and ﬁnal
states summed over all possible intermediate states, di-
vided by an energy denominator. For near-resonant ion-
ization, the energy denominator makes the near-resonant
term dominant, collapsing the sum to just one term. This
one term looks like the product of the probability that
an atom is excited into the 1F3 state multiplied by the
probability of photo-ionizing out of that state. We can
write this term as

ﬁle. Averaging the square of the intensity over the laser
proﬁle allows us to relate the photo-ionization rate to the
total laser power. In this case, it can be written as

The dipole trap decay rate as a function of the square
of the 488 nm laser power squared is shown in Fig. 4. For
each power level, we measured the dipole trap decay. At
suﬃciently low power levels, this decay is approximately
exponential, and we extract the decay rate using a least-
squares ﬁtting routine [25]. The decay rate depends on
power. The zero-extrapolated decay rate is τ −1
eﬀ = 0.93
kHz. This rate is approximately twice the radiative decay
rate. We see evidence in our experiment that our rate is

signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by collisions with atoms in the
thermal atomic beam.

The slope of the decay rate with power is 80 Hz/W2.
Using Eq. 7, we can determine the 1F3 photo-ionization
cross section. This gives a photo-ionization cross-section
for the 1F3 level of σ = 230 × 10−18 cm2. This extraordi-
narily large cross section suggests that the ﬁnal state lies
near a Rydberg state in the continuum. The ﬁnal state
is 133 cm−1 below the Ca II 2D3/2 ionization limit. The
principle quantum of hydrogenic Rydberg levels in this
region are n ∼ 29, and the separation between levels is 9
cm−1. Our measurements are carried out in the presence
of an electric ﬁeld, further increasing the probability of
ﬁnding a nearby Rydberg level. The NIST database tab-
ulates only odd parity levels in this energy region. We
are unaware of applicable quantum defect calculations or
measurements.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated an optical dipole trap for neu-
tral calcium atoms. These atoms are non-adiabatically
loaded into the trap by an optical pumping mechanism.
The lifetime of our trap is limited by the ∼ 2 ms life-
time of the 1D2 atoms and by collisions with atoms in
the thermal atomic beam.

Our initial interest in the calcium optical dipole trap
was its potential application to our ultracold plasma re-
search. It may be possible to use the dipole trap as the
beginning point for ultracold plasma expansion. The
plasma expansion depends on the exact density distri-
bution of the initial cloud. Compared to standard MOT
traps, a dipole trap has a well-deﬁned density proﬁle.
In addition, the long aspect ratio of the dipole trap will
make it possible to study plasma expansions in an eﬀec-
tively two-dimensional system. We plan to explore these
possibilities in future work.

[25] The trap depth is proportional to I, and the photoion-
ization signal is proportional to I 2. At high laser powers,
when atoms can be trapped even at large radii, it is possi-
ble that kinetic eﬀects will skew the photo-ionization sig-
nal. Atoms trapped at the bottom of the potential will be
ionized ﬁrst, and atoms trapped at the edge of the poten-
tial will be ionized at a later time. For low enough laser
powers, when the potential is too shallow to trap signif-
icant numbers of atoms, this eﬀect should not inﬂuence
the photo-ionization signal.

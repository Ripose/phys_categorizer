Abstract.

Electron-impact ionization cross sections for the 1s2s 1S and 1s2s 3S
metastable states of Li+ are calculated using both perturbative distorted-wave
and non-perturbative close-coupling methods. Term-resolved distorted-wave
calculations are found to be approximately 15% above term-resolved R-matrix
with pseudostates calculations. On the other hand, conﬁguration-average time-
dependent close-coupling calculations are found to be in excellent agreement with
the conﬁguration-average R-matrix with pseudostates calculations. The non-
perturbative R-matrix and close-coupling calculations provide a benchmark for
experimental studies of electron-impact ionization of metastable states along the
He isoelectronic sequence.

Electron-impact ionization of the metastable excited states of Li+

1. Introduction

Electron-impact ionization of low-charged ions is an important component of many
processes in astrophysics and controlled fusion plasmas. This topic has therefore
generated considerable interest, both experimental and theoretical. Previous studies
of ground-state He (Pindzola & Robicheaux 1998, Pindzola et al. 2004), as well
as He-like Li (Pindzola et al. 2000) and Be (Colgan et al. 2003), have shown that
both the R-matrix with pseudo-states (RMPS) method (Bartschat 1998) and time-
dependent close-coupling (TDCC) methods (Pindzola & Schultz 1996, Pindzola &
Robicheaux 1996) give cross-sections that are in very good agreement with experiment.
Far less work has been done on the electron-impact ionization cross-section of
metastable ions. One important example is excited He (1s2s 3S), that has been
studied both in experiment and theory. The experiment, performed by Dixon et al.
(1976), is in reasonable agreement at high energies with Bethe-Born calculations that
pre-date the experiment (Briggs & Kim 1971), and is in good agreement with ﬁrst-
order plane-wave Born results generated shortly afterwards (Ton-That et al. 1977).
More recently, however, several non-perturbative calculations have shown a large
discrepancy with experiment (Colgan & Pindzola 2002, Bartschat 2002, Fursa &
Bray 2003). These papers used TDCC, convergent close-coupling, and R-matrix with
pseudostates (RMPS). All of these calculations are in agreement, and all diﬀer from the
Dixon experiment by a factor of two, even at high energies. The helium discrepancy
motivates us to see whether the situation improves with metastable He-like Li.

Further motivation comes from plasma modeling. It has been previously shown
that ionization from the metastable Li+ can dominate the eﬀective ionization rate
coeﬃcient even at relatively low electron densities (1010 cm−3) (Loch et al. 2004).
However, all existing data on the excited states of Li+ is based on distorted-wave
calculations, which can get progressively worse as the term energy gets higher; this
was demonstrated in H-like ions, including Li2+, see Griﬃn et al. (2005). Thus it
is important to test the accuracy of the ionization data from excited states and to
determine the eﬀect that such data has on plasma modeling.

In this paper we build upon a previous study of the Li+ ground state (Pindzola
et al. 2000) to examine the electron-impact ionization cross-section of metastable
1s2s 1S and 1s2s 3S Li+. We compare the perturbative distorted-wave method with the
non-perturbative RMPS and TDCC methods. The cross-sections calculated using the
non-perturbative methods converge to the same value in Li+, while the distorted-wave
method gives results that are signiﬁcantly higher. This study provides a benchmark for
future experimental studies of electron-impact ionization from metastable states along
the He isoelectronic sequence. In the following section we discuss the various methods
we have used to calculate electron-impact ionization cross-sections of metastable Li+.
The results of these calculations are presented and compared in Section 3.

2. Theory

2.1. Distorted-wave method

The distorted-wave (DW) cross sections are calculated from a triple partial-wave
expansion of the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory scattering amplitude. Both direct
and exchange components of the scattering amplitude are included. The incoming
and outgoing electrons are calculated in a V N potential, while the ejected electron

is calculated in a V N −1 potential, where N = 2 is the number of electrons in the
target ion (Younger 1985). The DW potential for all continuum electrons is made
up of a conﬁguration-average Hartree potential for the direct interaction, and a local
semiclassical approximation for the exchange interaction.
For the term-resolved distorted-wave calculations,

the bound orbitals are
calculated using Fischer’s multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock code (Froese Fischer
et al. 1997). A double conﬁguration (1s2 and 1s2s) calculation for the 1s2s 1S term
yields an energy of -5.036 a.u. and an ionization potential of 14.59 eV, in good
agreement with the experimental value of 14.86 eV (National Institute of Standards
& Technology 2006). A single conﬁguration (1s2s) calculation for the 1s2s 3S term
yields an energy of -5.109 a.u. and an ionization potential of 16.58 eV, in very good
agreement with the experimental value of 16.60 (National Institute of Standards &
Technology 2006).

For the conﬁguration-average DW calculations, the bound orbitals are calculated
using Cowan’s (1981) Hartree-Fock code. Calculation for the 1s2s conﬁguration yields
an energy of 16.07 eV, in good agreement with the experimental value of 16.16 eV.

2.2. R-matrix with pseudostates method

The codes used in this work are based on the serial codes published by Berrington
et al. (1995), with modiﬁcations for the addition of pseudostates (see, e.g. Gorczyca
& Badnell 1997), and parallelization described in Mitnik et al. (1999), Mitnik
et al. (2003), and Ballance & Griﬃn (2004).
In this method, the high Rydberg
states and the target continuum are represented by a set of orthogonalized Laguerre
radial wavefunctions: the so-called pseudostates. The ionization cross-sections are
determined by summing over excitations above the ionization threshold, including all
single-electron excitations to the pseudostates as well as doubly excited states.

Our RMPS basis used spectroscopic orbitals up to n = 3 and pseudostates from
n = 4 to n = 14, with a maximum angular momentum of l = 4. The pseudostates with
l = 4 and 11 ≤ n ≤ 14 were omitted to keep the size of the calculation manageable.
For the incoming electron, partial waves from l = 0 to 13 were calculated using the
R-matrix method with exchange included. This was topped up from l = 14 with
methods described by Burgess et al. (1970) (see also Burgess 1974).

2.3. Time-dependent close-coupling method

We use the “frozen core” approximation that was previously used in electron-ionization
from metastable helium, where we freeze the 1s electron (see Colgan & Pindzola (2002)
and references therein). The frozen 1s orbital is the ground state of the hydrogenic
Li2+ ion. A complete set of orbitals are then obtained by diagonalization of the single-
particle Hamiltonian, including the direct term of the Hartree potential, and a local
approximation to the exchange interaction. The local exchange potential was scaled
to give single-particle energies close to experiment.
The initial two-electron wavefunction, P LS

l1l2(r1, r2, t = 0), is an antisymmetrized
product of a radial wavepacket and the target 2s radial orbital, with a particular LS
symmetry. The propagation in time is governed by the Schr¨odinger equation, which
we write as a set of time-dependent close-coupled partial diﬀerential equations

wavefunctions are projected onto products of the single-particle orbitals to calculate
the probability of excitation. The ionization probabilities, and hence the ionization
cross-sections, are found by subtracting the probability of any electrons being bound
from unity.

3. Results

The term resolved DW and RMPS results are shown in Fig. 1. We see that for both
methods the cross-sections are larger for the 1s2s 1S than the 1s2s 3S across the entire
energy range. Furthermore, the DW results are approximately 15% higher than the
ﬁtted RMPS results. The data ﬁts were made using the formula of Younger (1981):

σionization =

1
IE (cid:0)A(1 − 1/u) + B(1 − 1/u)2
+ C ln(u) + D ln(u)/u (cid:1)

(2)

where I is the ionization energy, E is the incident electron energy, and u = E/I. The
coeﬃcients A, B, C, and D are determined from a least-squares ﬁt to the calculated
cross-section (ﬁtting parameters are available from the authors upon request). Note
that the coeﬃcient C can be independently determined from the photoionization cross-
section, but we have left it as a free parameter.

While the DW and RMPS calculations are term resolved, and thus return both
1s2s 1S and 1s2s 3S cross sections, the TDCC calculation is conﬁguration averaged

ionization, against incident electron energy, E. The distorted-wave calculation
(dashed line) gives a cross-section around 15% larger than the non-perturbative
RMPS calculation (solid line). Three TDCC points are also shown (squares), and
these are in good agreement with the RMPS calculation. (1 Mb = 10−18 cm2)

and only gives a single cross-section for the 1s2s conﬁguration. In order to compare
the various theoretical calculations we show all of the conﬁguration-averaged results in
Fig. 2. The RMPS 1S and 3S results have been converted to a conﬁguration-average
cross section by averaging the ﬁts of (2). The DW cross-section in this graph was
calculated using the conﬁguration-average approximation (see Section 2.1). We also
took an average of the term resolved DW calculations, and it is in good agreement
with the conﬁguration-average result. The TDCC and RMPS cross sections are in
excellent agreement with each other, while the DW result is around 15% higher at the
peak than the non-perturbative results.

It is interesting that the perturbative DW method produces cross-sections that are
in good agreement with TDCC and RMPS for the ground state (1s2 1S) ionization
(Pindzola et al. 2000) and overestimates the metastable cross section. This is not
unexpected for such a near neutral system, since DW doesn’t include higher-order
coupling between the outgoing electrons. This “three body” eﬀect is more important
when the ionization limit is lower, as it is in the case of metastable Li+. This trend
is similar to that found by Griﬃn et al. (2005) for hydrogenic systems, including
Li2+. The discrepancy between the perturbative distorted-wave method and the non-
perturbative RMPS and TDCC methods is therefore larger for ionization from excited
states than for ground states.

One would also expect the eﬀect to be more important when the eﬀective ion
charge (the charge that the escaping electrons see) is smaller. In fact, this trend can
be seen when one compares the metastable He ionization cross-sections of Colgan
& Pindzola (2002) with the He-like Li results of this paper. As mentioned in the
introduction, the DW and perturbative methods diﬀer by a factor of two for metastable
He. Furthermore, this trend can be observed by comparing ionization from H to
ionization from Li2+ (Griﬃn et al. 2005).

4. Conclusion

We present results of three diﬀerent calculations of the electron-impact cross section of
metastable 1s2s 1S and 1s2s 3S Li+: distorted-wave, R-matrix with pseudostates, and
time-dependent close-coupling. We ﬁnd that the non-perturbative methods, R-matrix
and time-dependent close-coupling, are in excellent agreement. The perturbative
distorted-wave method, however, gives cross-sections that are signiﬁcantly larger than
those given by the non-perturbative methods. The non-perturbative R-matrix and
close-coupling calculations provide a benchmark for future experimental determination
of absolute ionization cross-sections from metastable states along the He isoelectronic
sequence.

The fact that the DW and TDCC methods are actually in agreement for ionization
cross-section from the Li+ ground state (Pindzola et al. 2000) has previously been
taken as a sign that DW is fairly dependable for this species. However higher-
order coupling between the outgoing electrons is not taken into account in the DW
calculations. Although these correlations become smaller as the nuclear charge Z
increases, they become larger for excited-state ionization. Thus the non-perturbative
methods are more appropriate for excited-state ionization. All existing electron-impact
ionization data for Li+ excited states comes from distorted-wave calculations (Loch
et al. 2006). In light of the results presented in this paper, however, this data will
need signiﬁcant revision.

The focusing of two-level atoms in a beam or trap after interacting with both far-detuned and
resonant standing wave ﬁelds in the thin lens and paraxial approximations is considered theoretically.
The thin lens approximation is discussed quantitatively from a quantum perspective. Exact quantum
expressions for the Fourier components of the density (that include all spherical aberration) are used
to study the focusing numerically. The following lens parameters and density proﬁles are calculated
as functions of the pulsed ﬁeld area θ: the position of the focal plane, peak atomic density, atomic
density pattern at the focus, focal spot size, depth of focus, and background density. The lens
parameters are compared to asymptotic, analytical results derived from a scalar diﬀraction theory
for which spherical aberration is small but non-negligible (θ ≫ 1). Within the diﬀraction theory
analytical expressions show that the focused atoms in the far detuned case have an approximately
constant background density 0.5(1 − 0.635θ− 1/2) while the peak density behaves as 3.83θ1/2, the
−3/4, and the depth of
− 1/2), the focal spot size as 0.744θ
focal distance or time as θ
− 3/2. Focusing by the resonant standing wave ﬁeld leads to similar results. However,
focus as 1.91θ
resonant focusing is also accompanied by a new eﬀect, a Rabi-like oscillation of the atom density.
For the far-detuned lens, chromatic aberration caused by the longitudinal velocity distribution in
an atom beam is studied quantitatively with the exact Fourier results. Similarly, the degradation
of the focus that results from angular divergence in beams or thermal velocity distributions in
traps is studied quantitatively with the exact Fourier method and understood analytically using the
asymptotic results. Overall, we show that strong thin lens focusing is possible with modest laser
powers and with atomic beam characteristics that are currently achievable in the laboratory.

I. INTRODUCTION

Evolving from the initial experiments [1,2], the study
of atom focusing using standing wave (SW) light ﬁelds
has developed into a broad area of research in atom op-
tics. A standing wave ﬁeld acts as a lens as a result of
a spatially-dependent light shift, focusing atoms into a
periodic set of lines or dots having widths of the order of
tens of nanometers and distanced from one another by
λ/2, where λ is the wave length of the light. Focusing
by thick lenses and atomic deposition on a substrate have
been observed for beams of Na [1,3–7], metastable He [2],
and Cr [8–10]. The latest achievements in this area are
summarized in a recent review article [11]. Perhaps even
more signiﬁcantly, lithographic techniques have been de-
veloped to create nanosurfaces in semiconductors and
metals using metastable atoms as a pattern template for
selective etching [12]. Similarly, cold, trapped atoms can
be subjected to SW light pulses [13,14], creating a peri-
odic wave packet which will focus along the ﬁeld propa-
gation direction at speciﬁc times following the atom-ﬁeld
interaction.

Previous experiments with atomic beams have been
carried out in a thick lens regime for which the atoms
focus within the laser beam. Since the substrate surface
is typically placed near the plane of peak intensity of the

thick SW lens and mechanically ﬁxed to the retroreﬂect-
ing mirror, in some sense these experiments are easier
to set up when compared to thin lens experiments. The
classical and quantum motion through a thick lens have
been numerically simulated and compared to experimen-
tal data in Refs. [7,15–18]. The classical motion and lens
parameters after thick and thin lenses have also been
studied in detail within a ray optics formalism [19]. For
that work the lens characteristics and aberrations beyond
the parabolic lens approximation were simulated numer-
ically as were the eﬀects of diﬀerent atomic velocity dis-
tributions. However, a comprehensive theoretical study
of the thin SW lens from a quantum perspective that
details corrections to the lens parameters as a result of
spherical aberration, chromatic aberration, and angular
beam divergence has not appeared previously.

In this article we stress the ﬂexibility and validity of
a thin lens approach, where the atoms are detected or
used for lithography after the interaction with the ﬁeld.
We derive exact and computationally expedient results
for atomic matter waves by quantizing the center-of-mass
motion from the outset, a process that naturally accounts
for spherical aberration. Our hope is to stimulate inter-
est in thin lens experiments by introducing a straightfor-
ward, yet rigorous theoretical framework for the problem
and by deriving analytical results for lens parameters to

1

facilitate lithographic and atom optical conﬁgurations.
The thin SW lens creates high contrast periodic struc-
tures in free ﬂight and opens up numerous possibilities
for Fourier atom optics to image and manipulate mod-
ulated matter waves. This approach is highly desirable,
especially when coupled with advances in Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) atom laser sources [14,20] with large
ﬂuxes and narrow velocity distributions. To our knowl-
edge similar studies have been carried out only numeri-
cally using a Fresnel diﬀraction theory in the coordinate
representation for a ”doughnut”-mode optical ﬁeld [21],
standing wave ﬁeld [22], and conical lens [23].

Rather than using the diﬀraction theory simply for nu-
merical propagation of the matter waves, we extend its
usefulness by deriving approximate analytical expressions
for the SW ﬁeld lens parameters. The Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ
integral, incorporating the lowest-order spherical aberra-
tion, gives a relatively simple form for the atomic wave
function near the focal plane and SW intensity extrema.
Asymptotically for large atom-ﬁeld pulse areas, this inte-
gral leads to a universal atomic density proﬁle, revealing
the behavior of the focal distance, peak atomic density,
focal spot size [half-width at half-maximum (HWHM)
of the atom density at the focus], depth of focus, and
background density as a function of the pulse area. The
analytical asymptotic results can then be compared to ei-
ther numerical asymptotic approximations of the Fresnel
integral or to the exact atomic distributions and lens pa-
rameters, most easily evaluated using a Fourier approach.
The time evolution of a free particle’s wave function,
when subject to a spatially periodic initial condition such
as that imposed on an atom beam after passing through
a SW ﬁeld or microfabricated grating [13,24,25], can be
expressed in terms of a Fourier expansion in the (plane
wave) spatial harmonics of the modulation period. As
such, the results we derive are closely related to the canon
of research on periodic light optics [26]. In the thin lens
approximation the Fourier components can be calculated
exactly for the wave function and density and then super-
posed to evaluate the atomic spatial distribution: for this
approach the calculations eﬀectively take place in a mo-
mentum representation, whereas a numerical integration
over the free particle propagator gives results in a coor-
dinate representation. The expressions for the density’s
Fourier components that we use below were obtained re-
cently for far-detuned [27] and resonant [28] SW ﬁelds.
To our knowledge this exact solution has not been used
previously to examine periodic focusing parameters, nor
to compare with approximate solutions of focused waves.
However, the Fourier components and the degradation of
this type of focusing have been proposed recently as a
way to study the onset of many-body eﬀects in conden-
sates [29].

The Fourier approach has several advantages. First,
the time dependence of the Fourier coeﬃcients directly
reveals the quantum nature of the periodic atomic den-
sity as it varies explicitly with the atomic recoil energy
of integer pairs of photons. Second, summation of the

Fourier series leads to fast convergence of the Fresnel so-
lutions to arbitrary accuracy for all times when compared
to the numerical integration of the full Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ
integral. With this Fourier method for example, we can
reproduce the main Fresnel diﬀraction results of Ref. [22]
without having to integrate the partial diﬀerential equa-
tion or equivalent integral equation on a lattice. Fur-
thermore, the Fourier method can be employed for the
general case of typical atomic beam experiments, where
the incident beam or trapped atoms are most accurately
speciﬁed by a density matrix in momentum space, such
as a thermal velocity distribution. The implications are
that the spatial extent of the atomic distribution is much
larger than the wavelength of the standing wave and the
wave function is not transform limited (except perhaps
for the case of a condensate), so that the focal densities
are conveniently found as a function of this initial density
matrix. As a direct result, while the failure to account
for ﬁnite beam size eﬀects with the Fourier series limits
our calculations to the near-ﬁeld and Fresnel diﬀraction
regimes, it is relatively unimportant for atom focusing
immediately following the SW pulse. We can then calcu-
late the eﬀects of chromatic aberration and angular beam
divergence by averaging the exact Fourier solution over
any longitudinal and transverse atomic velocity distribu-
tions.

In addition to lithographic detection schemes, one can
detect atomic distributions modulated by SW ﬁelds by
backscattering a pulsed traveling wave probe oﬀ of the
density either (a) at a certain distance from the grat-
ing for the beam case or (b) after a certain time for the
atoms released from a trap. The scattered signal is sen-
sitive to the lowest-order Fourier component [30] of the
modulated density. Previously, the backscattered signal
from a cold vapor subjected to strong SW pulses was ob-
served in Rb in a ground state echo experiment [13]. The
excellent agreement between the Fourier theory and ex-
periment that was achieved in that case insures that our
theoretical approach can be applied to the atom focusing
problem as well.

A new regime of atom focusing arises if the SW ﬁeld
is resonant with the transition between a ground and ex-
cited state and the time of interaction is less than the
excited state lifetime. After propagating from the SW
ﬁeld for a time just long enough for the excited state
to decay, the atom spatial distribution consists of two
parts [28]: the stimulated density, caused by direct am-
plitude modulation of the ground state wave function by
the ﬁeld, and the spontaneous density, produced by exci-
tation to and decay from the excited state. As a result of
the periodic Talbot revival, or self-imaging [26,31,33,34],
of the atomic spatial distribution, free evolution of the
stimulated part leads to atom focusing not only at the
focal distance Lf , but also at the distances jLT /2
Lf ,
where j is a positive integer, LT = λ2/2λdB is a Talbot
length, and λdB is the atom de Broglie wavelength. In
contrast to the stimulated part, the spontaneous modula-
tion decays at a distance on the order of LT as a result of

±

2

the Doppler shift associated with spontaneous emission.
At a suﬃciently large distance, the modulated sponta-
neous part disappears, and one can observe and analyze
atom focusing by a resonant SW ﬁeld. This analysis then
reveals a new eﬀect, a Rabi-like oscillation of the focal
parameters with the atom-ﬁeld interaction strength that
arises from an interference between diﬀerent components
of the matter wave.

This article is arranged as follows.

In Section II we
consider the focusing by a far-detuned ﬁeld acting as a
phase grating. Focusing by a resonant ﬁeld acting as an
amplitude grating is studied in Section III. Section IV is
devoted to the inﬂuence of chromatic aberration (longitu-
dinal velocity distributions) and angular beam divergence
(transverse velocity distributions). The quantitative re-
sults and illustrative examples are discussed in Section
V.

II. FAR-DETUNED STANDING WAVE LENS

Atom optical experiments can operate in the spatial
or time domain. For example, in the time domain a
vapor of cold atoms interacts with one or more radia-
tion pulses forming spatial gratings in the x direction.
Correspondingly, in the spatial domain an atom beam
traverses one or more optical elements or interaction re-
gions. For a monovelocity beam propagating along the
z axis with longitudinal velocity U and with the optical
elements aligned in the x direction, the spatial domain
conﬁgurations can be analyzed in the time domain if cal-
culations are performed in the atomic rest frame moving
with velocity U . In this frame the optical elements ap-
pear as interaction pulses. As a result, our calculations
are restricted to the time domain without loss of general-
ity (and are adapted to account for a longitudinal veloc-
ity distribution in Section IV). We consider the focusing
eﬀects of a single pulse.

The atom optical elements couple to the center-of-mass
degrees of freedom of an atom with mass M and de
Broglie wavelength λdB = 2π¯h/(M U ). When the SW

show that focusing is improved by taking a short inter-
action time and a large detuning relative to the Rabi fre-
quency and decay rate. In our case these conditions avoid
spontaneous emission (diﬀusive aberration [17]) both
during and after the atom-ﬁeld interaction. In this limit

A. Thin versus thick lens regimes

Before we proceed, a clariﬁcation is needed to empha-
size the diﬀerences between the thin lens (Raman-Nath)
and thick lens regimes of the SW atom lens. Some of the
quantitative diﬀerences have been examined by Henkel
and coworkers [37] in relation to Fraunhofer diﬀraction
of atoms and from a ray optics (classical) perspective by
McClelland for focusing [19]. For focusing considerations
we assume square pulses, g(t) = 1 for

sults. We also require

Conditions (13) are necessary for high contrast, thin lens

aﬀect the coeﬃcients of our results, not the scaling with
θ and ωqτ .)

The Raman-Nath regime leading to condition (11) is
normally deﬁned as an interaction for which the aver-
age kinetic energy gained by the atoms remains much

However,

the atoms also acquire an additional,

lowest order in θ2ωqτ . This is called the WKB correction
by Henkel and coworkers [37] and has its semiclassical
origin in the harmonic motion of the atoms during the
interaction. From a quantum perspective these ampli-
tude and phase changes are caused simply by the kinetic
energy acquired during the interaction. Heuristically, us-
ing the wave function which is evolving in the SW ﬁeld,

nian (8) numerically on a lattice [38].

B. Results for far-detuned, thin lens focusing

Returning to Eqs. (9) as the initial condition for the
free motion, since only the wave function phase has been
changed during the interaction, the total atom density,

is initially uniform. As diﬀerent Fourier components of
the wave function acquire diﬀerent phase shifts, ϕn(t) =
n2ωqt, during the free evolution, the atom density for
t > 0 becomes spatially modulated. The period of the
spatial modulation is equal to λ/2 = 2π/q. Transferring
to the dimensionless variables,

ρ(0, t±) = 1/2ρ(0, tf ).

(24)

This region is not symmetric with respect to the focal
time tf as a result of the spherical aberration of the lens.
(Note that the choice of θ as positive is unimportant even
though it implies a red detuning of the ﬁeld. The θ < 0
case is identical but shifted in x by π.)

Several of these exact lens parameters, as calculated
by Method 1, are compared to the approximate diﬀrac-
tion theory below. Equations (21b) will be modiﬁed to
account for ﬁnite beam divergence and chromatic aberra-
tion in Sec. IV; by its nature the Fourier method includes
spherical aberration (anharmonicity in the SW potential)
to all orders in the lens curvature. Although Eqs. (21)
are exact, they oﬀer no transparent possibilities for ob-
taining analytical forms for the lens parameters as func-
tions of θ. In contrast, a diﬀraction theory can be used
to ﬁnd approximate, asymptotic expressions (θ
1) for
the θ-dependences of the lens parameters.

Arbitrarily precise values of the focal time tf (giving
the focal plane position for the beam, Lf = U tf ) for a
given θ are deﬁned by the ﬁrst maximum of the density
along x = 0, ρ (0, t), as a function of θ using Eq. (21b).
Given the focal time, we can further characterize the lens
by the density proﬁle at the focus ρ (x, tf ) and its peak
ρ (0, tf ), the spot size of the focus w, the depth of fo-
cus ∆t , and the background density ρ (π, tf ) [39]. The
spot size w (HWHM of the density proﬁle ρ(x, tf ), where
ρ (0, tf ) is the maximum) can be deﬁned implicitly as the
smallest positive root of the equation

ρ(w, tf ) = 1/2ρ(0, tf )

(22)

Similarly, the depth of focus (confocal parameter) can be
deﬁned using Eq. (21b) as the time window,

∆t = t+ −

ing the interaction. The relevant time scale for focusing
will become apparent shortly. When θ

The lens parameters in this asymptotic diﬀraction the-
ory are deﬁned in the same way as they were for the exact
Fourier theory above. They are found graphically or nu-
merically by evaluating Eqs. (28), (30), and (32). The
focal time tf for a given θ (which is not given by t = θ−1)
can be found as the ﬁrst maximum of ρ (0, t) from Eq.
(32). Using this focal time tf , we further characterize
the SW lens by the peak density ρ(0, tf ) evaluating Eq.
(32), by the density proﬁle at the focus ρ(x, tf ) found
from Eqs. (28) and (30), by the spot size w (HWHM of
the density proﬁle ρ(x, tf )), and by the depth of focus ∆t
found from Eqs. (30a) and (32).

Calculations performed with these asymptotic diﬀrac-
tion results, only restricting x to be near xm = 2πm, are
referred to as Method 2.
In addition to the Method 2
asymptotic results, we can derive expressions which are

mate expressions from Method 2. The convergence of the
Method 2 result as θ increases is evident. In Figs. 3 the
pulse area dependences of the focal parameters, as calcu-
lated by the three methods, are compared. The accuracy
of Method 2 is generally better than that of Method 3,
but all methods converge for θ1/2

are discussed further in Sec. V, including the easily ex-
plained, constant oﬀsets of the asymptotic peak densities

III. RESONANT FOCUSING

caused by a resonant standing wave ﬁeld acting on a two-
level atom. If the pulse duration satisﬁes the inequality

(47)

[the ﬁeld area θ for a resonant SW ﬁeld is deﬁned below
by Eq. (50)], then during the interaction the ground and
excited state wave functions, ψ (x, t) and ψe (x, t), evolve
in an interaction representation according to

By satisfying Eq.
(47), we are assured that the reso-
nant atom-ﬁeld interaction is in the Raman-Nath regime
and that the pulse duration is shorter than the excited
state lifetime, avoiding the complications of saturation
and momentum space diﬀusion. If before the interaction
the incident wave function is uniform in the ground state,
ψ (x, 0−) = 1, then just after the interaction

The subsequent free space evolution and radiative de-
cay of the system were recently analyzed [28] using the
Fourier method for the closed two-level scheme (i.e., the

i

e
|

g
|

decays only to

excited state
) [41]. However, the
i
results that are relevant to the problem discussed here
pertain to any excited state decay scheme. In the follow-
ing paragraphs we summarize these results in order to
apply the three methods of Sec. II to the resonant case.
Our goal is to separate two terms in the free evolution of
the ground state: (1) the strict Hamiltonian evolution,
resulting from the ground state amplitude produced co-
herently by the SW pulse, and (2) the terms which re-
sult from spontaneous decay of the excited state. Such
a separation is straightforward by the Fourier technique,
Method 1. Once this is done, we can use a diﬀraction
analysis to obtain asymptotic results for the focal den-
sity caused by the Hamiltonian term, ψ(x, 0+) in Eq.
(49). The diﬀraction analysis, Methods 2 and 3 from
above, leads to analytic expressions for the resonant SW
lens parameters and, anticipating the results, sheds light
on the Rabi-like oscillation of the lens parameters as a
function of θ.

After the excited state decays (in a time t >
∼

Γ−1 fol-
lowing the pulse), the total atomic density ρ (x, t) in-
volves only the ground state and is a periodic function of
x having period λ/2. The atomic system can no longer be
described simply by a wave function since we must trace
the full density matrix over the spontaneously emitted
photons to form the reduced density matrix ρ (x, x′, t).
However, the part of the density matrix which was pro-
duced coherently by the pulse can still be described by
evolving the wave function ψ(x, 0+) in Eq.
(49) into
ψ (x, t). This was done in Ref. [28]. The total den-
sity ρ (x, t), which is formally the diagonal component
ρ (x, x, t) of the reduced density matrix, can be expanded
in a set of Fourier components,

ρ (x, t) =

In particular, the average stimulated density (n = 0) is

from the decay of the nth Fourier component of the ex-

by an atomic recoil, each harmonic’s spontaneous term
for n

depends on the momentum ¯hkr of the emitted photon,
n¯hqˆx
krt/M . The resulting inhomogeneous dephasing
after integrating over spontaneous emission directions

(55)

In the spatial domain this is equivalent to a length scale
on the order of the Talbot distance, LT . While we could
use the complete results of Ref. [28] to analyze focus-
ing including this spontaneous term for times t <

∼
choose instead to simplify the problem by waiting exactly

We can now use Eqs. (51), (53), (56), and (58) as ex-
act, Method 1 expressions to compare to an approximate
diﬀraction theory.

To present a diﬀraction theory of resonant focusing,
we consider only the stimulated ground state wave func-
tion ψ (x, t) evolving from ψ(x, jT + 0+) = ψ(x, 0+) [Eq.
(49)], remembering that it is ﬁrst necessary to add an
integer number of Talbot periods, jT , to reach an ”ini-
tial” time when the modulated spontaneous contribution

can be neglected. Moreover, we must add on the ad-
ditional background density from the spontaneous term,
Eq. (56), to the ﬁnal result.

The wave function, ψ (x, 0+) = cos[(θ/2) cos (kx)], is
amplitude modulated; however, ψ (x, 0+) superposes two
terms, each of which is phase modulated,

These states can be seen as evolving independently, lead-

Therefore, the problem of focusing after this speciﬁc type

θ > 0, near the even antinodes, kx = 0,

To calculate ψ− (x, t), it is suﬃcient to consider only
the harmonic part of the potential near x = 0, just as we

This contribution remains of order unity at the focus, i.e.,
it has relative weight θ− 1/4 compared to Eq. (63). Since

Eq. (63) is of higher accuracy than Eq. (64a) (relative
corrections to Eq. (63) are of order θ− 1/2), it is valid to
add Eqs. (63) and (64a) to form the total wave function
and calculate the density to absolute order θ

Interference between ψ+ (x, t) and ψ− (x, t) leads to a
new eﬀect, a Rabi-like oscillation of the focused atom dis-
tribution. Squaring ψ(x, t) = ψ+ (x, t)+ ψ− (x, t) to form
ρ(S) (x, t), we ﬁnd that the asymptotic stimulated atom

IV. CHROMATIC ABERRATION AND
TRANSVERSE VELOCITY DISTRIBUTIONS

A. Chromatic aberration

Chromatic aberration, the dispersion or wave length
dependence of a lens’ properties, results from a ﬁnite dis-
tribution of longitudinal velocities (i.e., de Broglie wave
lengths) in an atom beam. In trap experiments this type
of aberration is avoided. However, for beam experiments
detected in the laboratory frame, the atomic distribution
would be probed or deposited at a certain distance from
the interaction region, L = U t. As a result, the total
atom density at L will be an average of each velocity’s
density at L over the ﬂux of atoms with that velocity.
In general, to calculate the density, we must know the
longitudinal velocity distribution or at least its statis-
tical properties. Previous theoretical and experimental

publications that have discussed chromatic aberration
in the context of atom optical lenses have used heuris-
tic, numerical, or Monte Carlo simulation approaches
[6–8,11,15,17,19]. We attack the problem from a diﬀerent
perspective, based on averaging the exact Fourier com-
ponents over the atomic ﬂux distribution. The technique
is easy to apply, the results are simple to understand,
and the conclusions have a physical interpretation.

For the remainder of the paper, the ideal case will re-
fer to the monovelocity atomic beam with longitudinal
velocity U and inﬁnitely narrow longitudinal and trans-
verse velocity distributions. In the previous sections we
have presented a full characterization of the thin SW lens
acting on the ideal beam. Two types of beams with more
realistic longitudinal distributions are typical and will
be considered here, (1) a velocity narrowed beam cen-
tered around some average velocity U0 or (2) a thermal
beam with average speed U0.
In this section we con-
sider only focusing by the far-detuned standing wave.
For this type of lens, the exact expression for the den-
sity, Eq.
(21b), can be averaged over the proper ﬂux
distribution function for a speciﬁed L by numerical inte-
gration, provided the paraxial approximation still holds:
λdB,0 = 2π¯h/(M U0)
λ. In addition, the narrow veloc-
ity distribution case allows for an approximate analytical
solution to compare to the numerically integrated result:
by expanding the lens parameters around the average val-
ues of the ﬂux distribution, we can account for chromatic
aberration analytically using the density of the Fourier
method.

≪

In the laboratory frame the atoms interact with a SW
ﬁeld with a ﬁxed width σz along the z direction and are
then detected at a ﬁxed distance L from the lens. As a
result, the pulse area θ and the time of free ﬂight t after
the lens depend on the atomic longitudinal velocity U as
U −1. The atomic density is deﬁned as an average over
the single-particle atomic ﬂux distribution W (U ). This
distribution is a measure of the probability, W (U ) dU, to
ﬁnd an atom with velocity between U and U + dU pass-
ing through a plane perpendicular to the z axis. (One
would divide W (U ) by the atomic spatial density to get
a true ﬂux distribution in inverse units of particles per
unit time per unit area.) To derive quantitative results,
we need to specify W (U ) for a given experiment.

In this section we denote ﬂux averages

taking into account that only atoms having positive ve-
locity, U > 0, have to be included. Using this deﬁnition,
the average velocity U0, the (dimensionless) relative ve-
locity u, and the (dimensionless) ﬂux width v are given,
respectively, as

The integrals can be evaluated numerically, term-by-
term, giving the ﬂux-averaged Fourier components of the
density. If the distribution W (U ) has a non-zero width
v, then the focusing by the SW lens is degraded. We
show this graphically below.

We start with the narrow velocity distribution case,

goal is to determine the eﬀect of a ﬂux width v on the

the dimensionless ﬂux width v and not on the exact form

of the correction coeﬃcients, t1, ρ1 (0, t0,f ) , and w1, are

v, we can now quantitatively compare the approximate
expressions to the exact, numerically averaged density,

convenient distribution function.

On the other hand, since v <

sition should be the same. In analogy with the analysis
above, we consider the atomic density at a distance L
from the SW lens, where L = V t0 is now deﬁned by the
free evolution time t0 for an atom with thermal veloc-
ity V . (The average thermal ﬂux velocity U0 is given by

in-
stead of monitoring the peak atomic density ¯ρ (0, t0), we

Transverse velocity distributions put an additional
constraint on the thin SW lens performance and have
been a limiting factor in Fresnel atom optics and inter-
ferometry. For an atom beam, the angular divergence
is equivalent to the transverse velocity distribution of
atoms in a cold trap, again allowing a time domain treat-
ment. The transverse and longitudinal beam velocities
are generally related linearly by the angle in the parax-
ial limit. This is the case both for atomic beams colli-
mated by apertures and for beams that are laser-cooled
in the transverse direction. Given that we have already
discussed chromatic aberration in detail, here we present
comparative focal parameters and densities which include
either transverse eﬀects alone or simultaneous longitudi-
nal and transverse velocity eﬀects. Only the narrow lon-
gitudinal velocity atom beam will be considered in detail
since this type of beam leads to a better focus.

We will look at two cases. For both cases the Fourier
method suggests a straightforward interpretation of the
eﬀects of a transverse velocity distribution in terms of an
inhomogeneous decay of the density spatial harmonics.
First, we treat the case where the beam is monochro-
matic as in Sec. II and the transverse velocity distribu-
tion is either a uniform or one-dimensional Maxwellian
(thermal) distribution of transverse velocities. The uni-
form distribution might apply to an atomic beam colli-
mated by a slit or a pair of slits while the thermal distri-
bution might apply to a laser-cooled beam or to atoms
released from a laser-cooled trap. The resulting focal pa-
rameters and densities for the slit-collimated and laser-
cooled atoms are similar qualitatively. Then, we consider
a more general beam case where the transverse velocity
and longitudinal ﬂux distributions are decoupled, but the
longitudinal velocity dependence of the time couples the
transverse integration to the longitudinal. This applies
to atomic beams that are laser cooled before interacting
with the SW lens. The theoretical treatment of each of
these cases is facilitated by the Fourier method.

(70) and take W (U ) = δ(U

Our ﬁrst case is the monovelocity longitudinal beam
(v
0) with a transverse velocity distribution P (Ux).
To unify the longitudinal and transverse results, we start
with Eq.
U0). This is
equivalent to starting from Eq. (21a) or (21b) and tak-
ing U = U0, t = t0, and θ = θ0. Assuming we are
describing the atomic beam rather than the trap, the
atoms are again detected, deposited, or used for lithog-
raphy at L = U0t0. The inclusion of an initial transverse
velocity Ux during the atom-ﬁeld interaction will lead to
a Doppler shift of the ﬁeld frequency.
(Note that the
dimensionless transverse velocity scale that is consistent
with the dimensionless variables (20) is the single-photon
recoil velocity, Vk = ¯hq/2M .) We rigorously account for
the Doppler shift by taking x
x + Uxt and averaging
the density over P (Ux),

→

The assumption is that the initial transverse density ma-
trix is diagonal in momentum space and can be described
by a normalized velocity distribution P (Ux). In terms of
the longitudinal velocity U0 of the beam, the transverse
velocity can be written as Ux = U0ϕ, where ϕ is the
propagation angle with respect to the z-axis.

The two transverse distributions of interest, the uni-
form distribution P1(Ux) and Maxwellian distribution
P2(Ux), take the following form for Vx ≪

if desired, by deﬁning the divergence angle ϕd ≡
The ﬁrst distribution might be formed when a thermal
transverse distribution, peaked at Ux = 0 (ϕ = 0) with
velocity width much greater than Vk, is collimated by a
pair of slits which select a small range of propagation an-
gles up to ϕd. This beam has a rms transverse velocity
spread of V1 = Vx/√3. The second distribution might
be formed by transverse laser cooling, with or without
previous slit collimation, and has a rms velocity width
of V2 = Vx/√2. (Technically, the laser cooling process
can create a non-diagonal density matrix with transverse
momentum state coherences that are not accounted for
here but can be incorporated into a more general Fourier
result. We assume the distribution is narrow and diago-
nal.)

Fortuitously, both distributions again give closed-form
Fourier coeﬃcients for the density. Inserting Eqs. (80)
into Eq. (79), one ﬁnds

The interpretation is the same as for an atomic free in-
duction decay experiment [13]. The harmonics of the
total density undergo an inhomogeneous decay as each
velocity class Ux evolves with its own Doppler-shifted
frequency. The P1 result was recently explained in de-
tail as it is isomorphic to the evolution of a model, one-
dimensional BEC or a degenerate Fermi gas after inter-
acting with a SW pulse [29]. A similar expression to the
P2 result was used recently to explain the decay of peri-
odic echoes [13] and the decay of a quasiperiodic atomic
focusing and Talbot scheme [27]. For both distributions

be up to the order of the recoil velocity to avoid a signif-
icant decay of the high-order Fourier components neces-
sary for a highly-peaked focus. However, the restriction
Vx <
1 may be suﬃcient but not necessary. We have
∼
found in the previous sections that the lens parameters
scale with θ0, and, therefore, in Sec. V we show that the
restriction on Vx is somewhat relaxed.

The focal distance tf , deﬁned as the ﬁrst maximum of
Eq. (81a) or (81b), moves closer to the lens for Vx > 0
when compared to the focal distance for Vx = 0. This
makes sense since the transverse distribution causes a
decay in the modulated density in time. However, this
shift of the focal distance is secondary in importance to
the changes in the peak density at the focus and the spot
size. Moreover, as θ0 increases, the focal distance includ-
ing the transverse velocity spread converges rapidly to
θ−1
0 . We have calculated the
the ideal value near t0 ≃
peak density and spot size for selected values of Vx and
compared them to the ideal case. In Fig. 11 the peak
focal density, ρ (0, tf ) , and spot size w are plotted versus
θ0 for Vx = 0 (ideal), V1 = V2 = 1 (recoil limit), and
V1 = V2 = 2 (twice the recoil limit). For each of the
ﬁve curves, the exact, diﬀerent focal time at each value
of θ0 is used to calculate the parameters. For the same
rms velocity spread, the P2 distribution gives a narrower,
more peaked density spot than the P1 distribution. It is
signiﬁcant that the percentage error in the peak density
and spot size is decreasing as θ0 increases. This result is
expected since inhomogeneous decay is less pronounced
at earlier times, t0 ∼

To treat the full problem of focusing an atomic beam

it is not a simple matter to describe them
theoretically. However, if the beam is localized around
some large longitudinal speed and then laser cooled in
the transverse direction before the SW lens, the longi-
tudinal and transverse distributions are eﬀectively in-
dependent. We can model the total (normalized) ﬂux
probability W (U)dU as a product of the two indepen-
dent distributions, WlM (U )P2(Ux)dU dUx, using the lo-
cal Maxwellian longitudinal ﬂux distribution WlM (U ),

V. DISCUSSION

In this article we have developed a theory of atom
focusing by standing wave light ﬁelds in the thin lens
regime. We have shown that the exact analytical expres-
sions for the Fourier components of the atomic density,
recently used in the theory of atom interferometry, are
useful for numerical calculations of the focusing eﬀect
and all its relevant lens parameters, including the eﬀects
of chromatic aberration and angular divergence. We call
the Fourier technique Method 1.

≫

Within a small vicinity of the focal time, Eq.

Thin lens focusing becomes especially eﬀective for a
large ﬁeld area θ. When √θ
1 for the monoveloc-
ity case, using the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral,
we can consider only the ﬁrst anharmonic term of the
phase shift created by the SW light ﬁeld when expanding
around the potential wells at x′ = 2πm. This procedure,
labeled Method 2, leads to a manageable expression (30)
for the atomic density distribution which can be used to
evaluate the focal parameters by numerical integration.
(30)
simpliﬁes further to the asymptotic density proﬁle (36).
This is Method 3. The analytical correction to the focal
time and analytical expressions for the peak focal den-
sity, spot size, and depth of focus as functions of the
pulse area θ follow from this result. The last three lens
parameters scale as θ1/2, θ−3/4, and θ−3/2 respectively,
while the focal time scales as θ−1
[see
Eqs. (39), (40), (41), and (42)]. From Fig. 3 one sees
that in the range 0 < θ < 40, the accuracy of the Method
3 asymptotic expressions for the peak focal density, focal
time, and spot size can be as small as 17%, 1.9% and
18% respectively. The asymptotic parameters obtained
by Method 2 using Eqs.
(30) are generally more pre-
cise, giving accuracies for the same parameters as small
as 5.8%, 0.24% and 4%, respectively.

1 + 1.27θ− 1/2
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The accuracy of the asymptotic result for the focal
time tf is an order of magnitude better than for other
focusing parameters. Evidently, this is a consequence of
θ−1,
the fact that a ﬁnite value for the focal time, t
comes out of the harmonic approximation for the lens
potential. The ﬁrst anharmonic term then leads to a
relative correction of the order of θ−1/2 [see Eq. (39)],
and higher-order anharmonic corrections (not included
in our consideration) should have relative weights θ−1
and larger inverse powers of θ. As for the other param-
eters, which can be derived only by including the ﬁrst
anharmonic term, the next order corrections should have
a larger relative weight of θ−1/2.

∼

For example, the constant oﬀsets of the asymptotic
peak densities from the exact result in Fig. 3 can be ex-
plained as follows. A correction to the asymptotic wave
(31)] of relative weight θ−1/2
function at x = 0 [Eq.
would result from including the next order spherical aber-
ration, the x′6 term in the expansion of cos(x′) in Eq.
(28a). When the wave function is squared to form the
density, this relative correction of weight θ−1/2 multiplies

the lowest-order peak density that grows as θ1/2 to give
a constant term, which is automatically accounted for
by the exact Fourier method. Hence, the constant oﬀ-
set of the asymptotic peak density is not included in our
asymptotic expressions.

In this article we have also analyzed a new type of
atom focusing which arises when the SW ﬁeld is resonant
with the atomic transition. The density proﬁles and fo-
cal parameters for the resonant lens are shown in Figs.
4 and 5, respectively. To gain insight into the diﬀerent
interactions that can lead to focusing, we can consider
the far-detuned and resonant cases from a more general
point of view than that taken in Secs. II and III, still as-
suming that the ﬁeld envelope is short enough to neglect
spontaneous emission during the pulse. When an atom
interacts with a pulsed light ﬁeld, the states of the sys-
tem can be decomposed into a set of semiclassical dressed
states of the atom plus ﬁeld. If the atom-ﬁeld interaction
is adiabatic or the pulse turns on instantaneously, these
dressed states are instantaneous eigenstates of the total
Hamiltonian and therefore undergo a phase modulation.
When the light ﬁeld modes have a modulated intensity,
the dressed state energies and, therefore, phase evolu-
tions are also spatially modulated. Focusing can occur
near the intensity extrema, which correspond to spatial
minima of the dressed state energies. If initially the bare
atom was in a pure state such as the ground state
, the
i
atomic wave function after the interaction is generally a
coherent admixture of the two dressed states, which have
an energy separation that is spatially modulated. There-
fore, an interference term in squaring the bare state am-
plitudes can lead to a Rabi-like oscillation of the total
density and its properties. This Rabi-like oscillation can
be seen in Eq.
(65a) and Fig. 5 for a resonant SW
ﬁeld. Nonadiabatic, detuned atom-ﬁeld couplings can
lead to a similar eﬀect. The evolution of the pure and
dressed states in this regime has been considered previ-
ously without center-of-mass spatial eﬀects [43]. For the
far detuned standing wave (
) or an adiabatic
∆
|
|
turn-on of the ﬁeld, the ground state evolves into only
one of the dressed states while the other dressed state
has a negligible amplitude. As a result, one does not
observe any interference or ﬁeld dependent oscillation in
this case.

Up to this point in the discussion, we have reviewed the
ideal situation of the ideal atomic beam having no angu-
lar divergence and no longitudinal velocity distribution.
Our calculations in the thin lens regime have shown that
focusing results in a relatively large peak focal density.
For the most part, this result is in contrast to previous
experiments carried out in the thick lens regime, where it
proved diﬃcult to achieve such large density peaks. The
exceptions are certain experiments in Na at λ = 589 nm

we can compare that experimental data using a thermal
beam and thick SW lens with our results using a ideal
atomic beam and thin lens. From Fig. 3 or an exact
calculation, a pulse area of θ
14.86 (9.37) is needed for
a resolution of qw = 0.139 (qw = 0.139), or w = 6.5 nm

at this distance is shown with the thin solid line in Fig.

ratio of focal atomic densities at qx = 0 and qx = π (not
shown in Fig. 8), is c(tf ) = 27.2.

circular spot having radius σz ≃
ments in the thin lens regime, it is suﬃcient to focus the
ﬁeld only in the z-direction, along which the atomic beam
propagates. We assume that the laser ﬁeld intensity has
a Gaussian proﬁle in the (y, z) plane,

where σz and σy are ﬁeld radii along the z- and y-axes,
respectively (i.e., the directions perpendicular to the laser

atomic focusing into a set of lines, one should choose σy
to be larger than the atomic beam radius. From the
data in Refs. [6,7], σy should be as large as 0.5 cm. The

the required laser power is P = 1.89 mW. Even this power
level is four times less than the power used in the experi-
ment of Ref. [7]. To compare directly to the circular focus
of the ﬁeld in Ref. [7], we must take σy = 29 µm, giving
us a required power of P = 11.0 µW. These relatively low
power levels are suﬃcient for our consideration of thin
lens focusing.

We can now discuss the inﬂuence of chromatic aber-
ration assuming no angular divergence. A longitudinal
velocity distribution in the atomic beam leads to a degra-
dation of the focus. But even for the thermal beam, the
normalized distribution width v is still less than 1 [see
Eq.
(78)], and we have shown that the order of mag-
nitude of the focusing parameters is the same as for the

≪

ideal beam (v = 0). For narrow ﬂux distributions, v
1,
the lowest-order corrections to the atom density behave
as v2 [see Eqs. (73)] if θ >
1. This is a simple conse-
∼
quence of the fact that terms linear in the deviation from
the average atomic ﬂux vanish after averaging over veloc-
ities for any symmetric, or asymmetric, distribution. In
particular, this principle applies to the analytical Fourier
components of the density multiplied by the narrow, lo-
cal Maxwellian ﬂux distribution WlM (U ), Eq. (70), for
small v.

In Fig. 7 we show the exact (using WlM (U )) and ap-
proximate reductions of the density at the ideal beam
focal time, ¯ρ(0, t0,f )/ρ (0, t0,f ) [42], as functions of v for
two values of θ0, 14.86 and 9.37. Again, these choices for
θ0 are the pulse areas required to achieve w0 = 6.5 and
10 nm spot sizes [6,7], respectively, using ideal sodium
beams. The quadratic dependence, consistent with Eqs.
(74c), is evident for small v, but the exact density peak
actually reduces more slowly (linearly) at larger values
of v where the small v approximation breaks down. At
this point the expansions of the Bessel functions of Eq.

To test this idea, we have also examined the depen-
dence of the spot size increase, w/w0, on v for θ0 = 14.86
and 9.37 using the exact density for WlM (U ).
In Fig.
7 the spot size’s quadratic dependence for small v turns
into a linear dependence near the same value of v that
the peak density reduction deviates from the approxi-
mate theory. We see that the chromatic aberration has
a smaller eﬀect on the spot size than on the peak den-
sity. Note that from a ray tracing argument for far-ﬁeld

the case for the SW ﬁeld lens, where spherical aberration
determines the limiting resolution up to large values of
θ0. Thus, the chromatic aberration we ﬁnd is less severe
and depends strongly on θ0. We have not explored this
θ0 dependence further. However, from Fig. 7 we deduce

Eq. (74c). From Fig. 6 or 7 for θ0 = 14.86, to limit

the peak density reduction to α = 10%, we can esti-

calculate the other parameters approximately from Eqs.
(74b) and (74e), the percentage corrections to the focal
distance and spot size are even less than α, 3.9% and
1.3%, respectively. A longitudinal width, v
0.086, is
typical of the supersonic beams produced by seeding an
inert (noble) gas supersonic expansion with sodium [45].
While the mean longitudinal velocity of a beam produced
recently from a BEC of sodium atoms by Bragg scatter-
ing [14] was only 2¯hk/M, or 6 cm/s, the rms longitudinal
and transverse velocity widths were only approximately
0.16¯hk/M and 0.30¯hk/M , respectively, giving v
0.11
and justifying the paraxial approximation. In these ex-
periments, mean longitudinal velocities up to 11.9 ¯hk/M,
or 35 cm/s, with similar widths were also achieved using
higher-order Bragg scattering, implying v
0.1. Since
experiments producing atomic beams of this type are in
their infancy, we expect that achieving relative velocity
widths of v

0.1 will shortly become routine.

In Fig. 8 the atomic distribution at the focus ¯ρ (x, tf )
(dotted line), as calculated exactly using WlM (U ) in Eq.
(70) for θ0 = 14.86 and our extreme case from Fig. 7
U0 = 0.2), is compared to the ideal
of v
case (thin solid line). While the reduction of the peak
density from 11.4 to 7.81 is a signiﬁcant 31% on a scale
where
0.5 is the background at the focus, the half-
width deﬁning the spot size is broadened by only 5% (or
0.33 nm in sodium), and the coherent oscillations of the
density along x are still prevalent. This suggests that
even for v
0.2 and a focal peak reduced by chromatic
aberration, a high resolution, large contrast focus is pos-
sible with the thin SW lens. In addition, using the ﬂux
distribution WlM (u) with v = 0.194, we have also calcu-
lated that the ﬁeld area, θ0 = 15.7, is required to restore a
spot size of qw = 0.139, or 6.5 nm in sodium. This corre-
sponds to the laser power, P = 2.0 mW, for σz = 29 µm,
σy = 0.5 cm, and ∆ =

(1.71 GHz).

We have also considered the focusing of a thermal
atomic beam with ﬂux WM (U ). The results of the calcu-
lations are graphed in Figs. 9 and 10. For this part of the
paper only, we changed the deﬁnition of the focal distance
to be one where the contrast (44), and not the density, is
optimized. The contrast, c (t0) = ¯ρ (0, t0) / ¯ρ (π, t0) , for
θ0 = 23.0 at a distance L from the SW ﬁeld (t0 = L/V )
is shown in Fig. 9. We see that c (t0) contains three
local maxima of approximately equal weight near the fo-
cus. They arise as a result of the time-oscillations of the
ﬂux-averaged, background atom density near t0 = tf ,
¯ρ (π, t0). These contrast maxima ”compete” with one
another in some sense as diﬀerent values of the pulse
area correspond to diﬀerent velocity classes and there-

fore diﬀerent focal distances. This eﬀect results in the
discontinuities in the pulse area dependences of the lens
parameters seen in Fig. 10.

For the longitudinal thermal beam and θ0 = 23.0, the
focal contrast is equal to c (tf ) = 8.03 while the spot
size or spatial resolution is again qw = 0.139. For the
same experimental parameters as above, σz = 29 µm,
σy = 0.5 cm, and ∆ =
(1.71 GHz), a laser ﬁeld
2π
power of P = 2.9 mW is needed to produce a pulse area
of θ0 = 23.0.

Finally, the atomic beam angular divergence has a cru-
cial impact on the focus, independent of the chromatic
aberration. For a beam with no chromatic aberration,
U = U0,
if atoms move at an angle ϕ with respect
to the z-axis, the density proﬁle displaces a distance
Uxtf along the x axis. This displace-
δx
ment should ideally be much smaller than the funda-
mental spot size w that accounts for spherical aberra-
tion. We can use the previously generated, exact spot
sizes and focal times for each θ0 to estimate the max-
imum allowed rms transverse velocity from this argu-
ment, V (f )
w/tf . This corresponds to an angular
rms
divergence ϕf = V (f )
w/(tf U0). We expect that
allowing Vrms to be V (f )
rms will at most double the spot
size.

which is the condition required to observe atom interfer-

(85) arises from the requirement that atoms moving at
an angle ϕ not be displaced more than λ/2 at the Talbot

This argument is consistent with Eqs. (81) and Fig.
11. This ﬁgure suggests that small spot sizes with sharp
density peaks can be achieved for laser powers in the
microwatts to milliwatts range even for transverse distri-
bution widths larger than the recoil limit. (In Fig. 11,
note that qw = 0.3 corresponds to a 14 nm spot size in
sodium.) For example, taking θ0 = 40 and remember-
ing that the slit-collimated beam has a rms transverse
velocity V1 (Vx√3) in units of Vk, the exact spot size

for V1 = 0 is qw = 0.0577 from Eq. (81a). Now, as-
suming the divergence is the maximum allowed, we set
V1 = w/tf = 1.883 for θ0 = 40 and ﬁnd that the spot
size is broadened to 0.100 (4.69 nm in sodium), or 73%.
The spot size has less than doubled for a transverse width
almost twice the recoil limit. Similarly, the asymptotic
predictions for θ0 = 40 give an increase from a spot size
of qw = 0.0468 (not 0.0577) for V1 = 0 to a spot size
of 0.0826 for V1 = U0ϕf = 1.495 from Eq. (84) in Eq.
(81a), a 76% increase. The broadening is even less severe
for Maxwellian transverse distributions.

We now take a case of experimental interest to demon-
strate the combined eﬀects of transverse and longitudi-
nal broadening on the focal density. The pulse area,
θ0 = 14.86, is used again. We show results for the P2

(Maxwellian) transverse distribution, Eq.

monochromatic beam (v

the other curves in this ﬁgure to provide a real picture

Our work suggests emphatically that the thin SW lens
can focus atoms eﬀectively if the angular divergence is
cooled near the recoil
limit, even in the presence of
strong chromatic aberration. This makes physical sense if
one considers that the longitudinal velocity average over
slightly diﬀerent focal regions for each velocity subclass
is a slowly-varying integral over the Fourier amplitudes
when compared to the more sensitive transverse veloc-
ity integral, an average over the Doppler phases. Atomic
beams of the type considered throughout this article can
be made in the laboratory with current technology.

In addition to the experimental possibilities for stan-
dard atomic beams that limit angular divergence by slit
collimation or transverse laser cooling, recent experi-
ments that use higher-order Bragg diﬀraction of a BEC
to form atomic beams with transverse and longitudinal

rms velocities smaller than the recoil velocity [14] of-
fer a promising avenue to observe and characterize thin
lens focusing eﬀects. We would even argue that focal
patterns nearly identical to those described in this pa-
per have already been achieved but not recognized in
recent condensate experiments on the so-called momen-
tum space Talbot eﬀect [46]. In these experiments a cloud
of cold atoms from a condensate interacts with two oﬀ-
resonant SW pulses, separated by a variable time delay.
The detection scheme is insensitive to Fresnel eﬀects as
the researchers image the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction pattern and
therefore the atomic momentum distribution. However,
the accurate ﬁt of the data in that experiment to our
Raman-Nath theory suggests that the thin lens focusing
eﬀect is occurring after the ﬁrst pulse along the SW grat-
ing direction. A detection scheme sensitive to the Fresnel
density pattern may be necessary to image the focusing
atoms in the cloud.

[39] Other deﬁnitions of the focal time are possible, such as
the earliest time that maximizes the ratio or the dif-
ference between the peak and background densities, or
the point where the peak-width product is a maximum.
The deﬁnition we have chosen, the ﬁrst maximum of
ρ (0, t) , is suﬃcient to characterize the lens fully. Fur-
thermore, this deﬁnition is consistent with the optical
lens focus and leads to nearly identical results as a def-
inition where the diﬀerence in central and background
densities, ρ (0, t) − ρ (π, t) , is maximized. We also use the
term spot size instead of line size or linewidth to refer
to the HWHM of the focused line created by the one-

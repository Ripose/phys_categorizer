We report the observation of multiple laser thresholds in the many-atom cavity QED microlaser.
Traveling-wave coupling and a supersonic atom beam are used to create a well-deﬁned atom-cavity
interaction. Multiple thresholds are observed as jumps in photon number due to oscillatory gain.
Although the number of intra-cavity atoms is large, up to N ∼ 103, the dynamics of the microlaser
agree with a single atom theory. This agreement is supported by quantum trajectory simulations
of a many-atom microlaser and a semiclassical microlaser theory. We discuss the relation of the
microlaser with the micromaser and conventional lasers.

The most fundamental model of light-matter interac-
tion at the atomic level consists of a two-level atom cou-
pled to a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, e. g.
in an optical resonator. For an atom-cavity coupling
strength greater than the decay rates of atom and cavity
(g
Γc, Γa), an excited atom exchanges energy coher-
ently with the cavity (Rabi oscillation). [1]

≫

Atom-resonator interaction is also the domain of laser
physics; therefore it may be somewhat surprising that
most descriptions of laser operation use an incoherent
model involving population densities and Einstein A and
B coeﬃcients. Such a model applies due to gain medium
broadening, laser ﬁeld nonuniformity, and other statisti-
cal eﬀects [2].

The microlaser is to our knowledge the ﬁrst laser in
which coherent Rabi oscillation is explicitly reﬂected in
the dynamics of the laser. A controlled atom-cavity inter-
action and absence of strong statistical averaging leads to
behavior foreign to conventional lasers. In this paper we
report the most dramatic of these eﬀects, the existence
of multiple laser thresholds.

The microlaser is the optical analogue of the micro-
maser [3], in which a similar bistable behavior has been
observed for a single atom in the cavity [4]. The most sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between the two experiments are: (i)
a large number of atoms is present, (ii) optical frequen-
cies allow direct detection of generated light, and (iii)
the number of thermal photons at optical frequencies is
negligible.

An earlier version of the microlaser experiment [5] was
shown to exhibit laser action with an intracavity atom
number N on the order of 1. In the current setup, N
1;
remarkably, the many-atom system exhibits very similar
behavior to that predicted from a single atom theory.
This is supported by quantum trajectory simulations and
may be explained by a semiclassical theory ([6], [7]).

The experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1. A supersonic
beam of 138Ba atoms passes through the TEM00 mode
of a high-ﬁnesse optical cavity (symmetric near-planar

is less than 10−6 torr. Prior to entering the cavity mode,
each atom is excited by a cw pump laser (Coherent 899-
3P1 transi-
21 Ti:Sapphire ring laser) locked to the 1S0
tion (λ = 791.1 nm, linewidth Γa
50 kHz) as described
in [8]. The pump beam is focused by a cylindrical lens to
a roughly 50µm
500µm elliptical Gaussian beam cen-
tered approximately 150 µm from the cavity axis. This
distance between pump and cavity mode assures that the
pump beam does not overlap the cavity, while minimiz-
ing the eﬀect of atomic decay between the pump and
cavity. The total decay rate from the 3P1 excited state

corresponds to a decay length

To measure the state of atoms which have passed
through the pump beam, we monitor ﬂuorescence of the
atoms in the focused beam of a dye laser tuned to the
1S0
1P1, λ = 553.5 nm transition. The atoms were
found to follow an adiabatic inversion process due to a
Doppler frequency chirp from pump beam defocus. The
eﬀect is similar to that described in [9]. Incomplete inver-
sion of the atoms by the pump beam is accounted for by
deﬁning an eﬀective atom number Neﬀ

In order to observe multiple thresholds, a well-deﬁned
atom-cavity interaction is essential, requiring a redesign
of the earlier system [5].

Uniform atom-cavity interaction is achieved via control
of atom-cavity coupling g and interaction time tint. The
rapid spatial variation in coupling due to cavity stand-
ing wave is eliminated by introducing a small tilt of the
atomic beam relative to the normal to the cavity axis
(cf. [10]).
In this conﬁguration the microlaser exhibits
two Doppler-shifted resonances approximately centered
at cavity frequencies ωa
kv0θ where ωa is the atom
resonance frequency.

The atom beam is restricted to the center of the Gaus-
250µm rectangular aperture lo-
sian mode by a 25µm
cated approximately 3 mm from the cavity axis. The
aperture is translated and rotated in order to overlap
the cavity axis as closely as possible. The resulting total
atom-to-atom variation in peak coupling g is estimated
to be

10%.

To ensure uniform atom-cavity interaction times, a su-
personic atomic beam with narrow velocity distribution
is used. The beam oven is similar to that of Ref. [11]
and consists of a barium-ﬁlled resistively heated tanta-
lum tube with a 250 micron diameter nozzle. The dis-
tance between the oven and cavity is 45 cm. The longi-
tudinal velocity distribution was measured via a Doppler

tal FWHM variation in gtint of approximately 15% is
achieved. Atomic density in the cavity is modulated by

ogous stochastic averaging is justiﬁed in the appendix of
[12].)

The rate equation is expressed graphically in Fig. 2.

In the ﬁrst experiment, the microlaser cavity was
locked on resonance (ωcav = ωa + kv0θ) and the mi-
crolaser emission measured as a function of atom den-
sity. The cavity was chopped between data collection and
locking on resonance with the atoms. Locking was per-
formed with a 791 nm probe beam tuned to ωa +kv0θ via
acousto-optic modulators and aligned with the TEM00
mode of the cavity. The cavity transmission was moni-
tored by an avalanche photodiode (APD) and a feedback
loop controlled the cavity PZT voltage to hold the cavity
at resonance. Photons exiting the cavity were incident

In both cases the microlaser emission was observed for

Results from the cavity locking experiment are shown
in Fig. 3. The solid line represents the solution to Eqn. 1
and is composed of two branches for the range of Neﬀ
shown. The ﬁrst (lower) and second (upper) branches
correspond to the ﬁrst and second Rabi oscillations of
Fig. 2. The lower half of the second branch (the portion
of the line with negative slope in this ﬁgure) is unstable.
Intracavity atom number was determined by measur-
ing ﬂuorescence at 1S0
1P1, λ = 553.5 nm with an
imaging system and CCD camera. Uncertainties in cav-
ity transmission, optical reﬂection coeﬃcients, and CCD
quantum eﬃciency make it diﬃcult to measure the ab-
solute density accurately. A ﬁt to the experimental data
was used to obtain a scale factor. A ﬁtting parameter
is close to the value expected from ﬂuorescence measure-
ments. The number of photons in the cavity is similarly
estimated by considering the cavity parameters, losses in
the optics, and detector quantum eﬃciency. In both cases
the ﬁtting parameters were within
50% of expected val-
ues.

The unseeded results are in good agreement with the

ﬁrst solution branch. The seeded results agree with the
ﬁrst branch for densities up to the onset of bistability at
240; above this point the results agree with the
Neﬀ
second branch.

A calculation for steady-state average photon number
using single-atom micromaser theory of Filipowicz et al
[12] predicts a sharp transition between the ﬁrst and sec-
ond branches in at N 0
415. No such transition was
observed, apparently due to very long metastable life-
times in the picture of the Fokker-Planck analysis of [12],
due to the large photon number.

In the second experiment, the cavity detuning ∆cav =
ωcav
ωa is varied for constant atom density. Data for the
detuning curves for a range of atom densities are shown in
Fig. 4. The solid and dashed lines represent scans in the
positive and negative detuning directions, respectively.

Two-peaked structure is due to two traveling-wave res-
onances of the tilted cavity. The Doppler splitting was
measured to be about 27.1 MHz, corresponding to a cav-
ity tilt angle θ

13 mrad.

As density is increased, the two resonances broaden
and increase in amplitude. For Neﬀ
630 the second
threshold appears as a “spike” near the peak of each res-
725 a jump to a third branch
onance, and at Neﬀ
appears.

≈

The detuning lineshapes display strong asymmetry and
hysteresis for atom numbers above the second thresh-
old. For densities in which sudden jumps occur, each
traveling-wave resonance of the cavity scanning line-
shapes is highly asymmetric and shows hysteresis as
a function of scan direction. This is most likely due
to interactions with the two Doppler-shifted ﬁelds at
ωa
kv0θ. For the general case in which neither ﬁeld is
dominant, the atoms experience a complex bichromatic
interaction with these two ﬁelds. A simple model has
been shown to qualitatively describe the lineshape asym-
metry and hysteresis observed here. More detailed quan-
titative descriptions are in progress.

±

To examine the application of single-atom theory to
our many-atom microlaser, a semiclassical theory [6] of
the microlaser analogous to the Lamb theory of the con-
ventional laser [13] has been developed. In the case of
monochromatic ﬁeld and zero atom-cavity detuning, the
semiclassical theory reduces to the rate equation model.
This provides a more rigorous justiﬁcation for Eqn. 1.

We have also performed quantum trajectory simula-
tions of a microlaser with up to 5 intracavity atoms
[14]. The many-atom microlaser was shown to be in close
agreement with the predictions from a single-atom the-
ory [12], with a perturbation in the width of the photon
number distribution due to cavity decay during the in-
teraction time.

The connection between the microlaser with the con-
ventional laser may be illustrated by considering the ef-
fect of increased variation in gtint. For simplicity suppose

In summary, the microlaser is shown to exhibit multi-
stability due to coherent atom-cavity interaction, which
in conventional lasers is hidden by spontaneous emission
and other incoherent processes.

We have recently demonstrated that the microlaser
ﬁeld exhibits sub-Poisson photon statistics [15] even for
hundreds of intracavity atoms. Measurement of the spec-
trum of microlaser emission [16] is also planned.

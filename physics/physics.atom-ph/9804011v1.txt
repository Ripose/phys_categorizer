Abstract

The processes with three or more charged particles in the ﬁnal state exhibit

particular threshold behavior, as inferred by the famous Wannier law for (2e +

ion) system. We formulate a general solution which determines the threshold

behavior of the cross section for multiple fragmentation. Applications to

several systems of particular importance with three, four and ﬁve leptons

(electrons and positrons) in the ﬁeld of charged core; and two pairs of identical

particles with opposite charges are presented. New threshold exponents for

these systems are predicted, while some previously suggested threshold laws

are revised.

I. INTRODUCTION

The famous Wannier [1] threshold law has quite an unusual status among other threshold

laws in quantum mechanics. Being based on an appealing mechanism, it has inspired a large

number of studies where the law was rederived, extended, tested or rebutted. The intensity

of these studies does not show a decrease with time as testify some representative references

to the recent publications [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]

[19] [20] [21]. A complete bibliography on the subject would be immense.

In this paper we suggest a method which generalizes the Wannier mechanism when

break-up of the quantum system on a large number (four or more) of charged fragments is

concerned. Apparently, for the ﬁrst time the particular case of the problem was treated in

1976 in the important paper by Klar and Schlecht [22] where the threshold law was derived for

escape of three electrons from the charged core. It was suggested that the receding electrons

form a symmetrical conﬁguration of equilateral triangle with the positively charged core in

its center. The treatment was quite involving and specialized being based on hyperspherical

coordinate system [23]. Later Gruji´c [24] rederived the same result using the standard

Cartesian coordinates where the symmetry considerations are easy to apply explicitly in full

extent. Gruji´c considered also some other systems along the same lines [25] [26] [27] (see

more details in Sec.V). The threshold law for the three-electron escape seems to ﬁnd support

in the experimental data on the near-threshold double ionization of atoms by electron impact

[28]. Later Feagin and Filipczyk [29] claimed an existence of a complementary law which is

manifested at energies somewhat above a threshold, see critical discussion in Section VA.

The interest to the problem was renewed recently when two electrons and positron re-

ceding from the core with Z = 1 charge were considered by Poelstra et al [30]. A brief

note by Stevens and Feagin [31] on complete fragmentation of H2 molecule is also to be

mentioned. The ﬁnal state in the reaction with a positron could be produced by double

ionization of a negative ion by positron impact. However, the forthcoming experiments by

Knudsen and co-workers [32] concern positron impact double ionization of neutral atoms

2

(Z = 2) where the threshold law has not yet been available.

Its derivation was one of

motivations for the present study. Eventually it has developed into a general approach to

the multi-fragmentation problem which possesses two important advantages. Firstly, our

method describes a general situation with arbitrary number of charged fragments in simple

terms in an arbitrary coordinate frame. Secondly, it is convenient and reliable for practical

realizations. This allows us to clarify important conceptual aspects of the problem which

were misunderstood or misinterpreted previously. Comparing our solution with known in

literature results we reproduce a number of threshold exponents for diﬀerent systems. At the

same time we ﬁnd that several published previously results need improvement, in particular,

we revise the threshold law for 2e− + e+ escape. A general nature of the developed method

is illustrated by consideration of new complicated situations with up to six charged particles

in the ﬁnal state where a number of new threshold exponents is predicted.

In Section II we introduce particular conﬁgurations which will be called scaling con-

ﬁgurations. They describe a multidimensional dynamic potential saddle, generalizing the

Wannier ridge which is well known for (2e + ion) system. These conﬁgurations are related

to rectilinear trajectories of all particles in the system and play a crucial role for the complete

fragmentation process close to its threshold. SCs embrace the essence of previous treatments

of particular systems, but avoid attachment to some special theoretical formalism and re-

lated technical complications. The closest analogue of our general approach in particular

case of three-body Coulomb systems could be found in papers by Simonovi´c and Gruji´c [33].

Description of small deviations from SC is given in terms of a set of harmonic oscillators

and inverted oscillators (Section III). The later ones describe unstable modes which govern

the threshold law. They are quantized following a general scheme suggested by Kazansky

and Ostrovsky [34] [35]. This allows us to construct a reduced form of the wave function

for the system of charged particles and derive the threshold law in Section IV generaliz-

ing a procedure used previously by Kazansky and Ostrovsky [4] [12] for derivation of the

conventional Wannier law. Application of a developed general scheme to some particular

systems (Section V) is followed by concluding discussion of special features of the Wannier-

3

type threshold laws, with an emphasis on a relation between the underlying statistical and

dynamical aspects of the problem (Section VI).

II. SCALING EXPANSION

Our goal is to consider some atomic process which breaks an atomic particle into several

charged fragments for low excess energy E. In this situation the motion of the fragments in

the ﬁnal state of the reaction can be described in the semiclassical approximation because

a typical variation of the Coulomb potential UC ∼

λ/r2, is less than a typical kinetic energy T

inside the Coulomb zone r

rC = 1/E where the major events take place. Therefore the

≤

ﬁrst thing to do is to ﬁnd classical trajectories which lead to the desired ﬁnal state with

total fragmentation.

It is very important that for low energy E there exists a severe restriction onto these

trajectories. To see this let us imagine what is happening with distances separating fragments

when they move out of the reaction domain.

If a distance separating some pair of two

attracting fragments diminishes with time, then one should expect that this pair of fragments

can be considered as a dipole which interacts with the rest fragments. This interaction can

transfer the kinetic energy of the two fragments to the other fragments. Therefore one

has to expect that eventually these two fragments will loose enough energy and form a

bound state.

If this event happens then the desired total fragmentation is not achieved.

This discussion shows that one should look for those trajectories which exhibit a monotonic

increase of distances separating the fragments. The point is that the lower is the available

above-threshold energy the more restrictive this condition is.

It is convenient to present the discussed situation considering the potential energy in the

multidimensional conﬁguration space where its behavior can be described as kind of “valleys

4

separated by ridges”. This physical picture ﬁrst suggested by Wannier for a particular

class of reactions was discussed by Fano [36,37] in general case. If a system occupies some

place on some ridge then its trajectory can either go down into some valley where a bound

state of some fragments is created, or continue to propagate along the ridge. For the total

fragmentation one should ﬁnd a classical trajectory along a top of some ridge which leads

from the region of small separation of fragments into the ﬁnal state with inﬁnite separation.

It is clear that the lower is the above-threshold energy, the closer a trajectory should be to

the top of the ridge.

Generally speaking there might exist several such ridges which lead to the ﬁnal state

with total fragmentation.

In this work we study a particular ridge, which will be called

the scaling conﬁguration (SC). For all the systems considered up to now we have found

that this conﬁguration exists. More than that, for a given system there may exist several

diﬀerent SCs. A number of examples demonstrating this property is considered in Section

V. Therefore one might suspect that SC is a general feature, though this latter statement

is not veriﬁed so far. For two electrons in the ﬁeld of an ion this ridge coincides with the

Wannier ridge.

The basic idea is simple. As was said above one has to be sure that distances separating

fragments monotonically increase with time. This condition is deﬁnitely satisﬁed if a tra-

jectory describing N particles which have masses mj (j = 1, 2,

N) obeys the following

· · ·

conditions

~rj(t) = φ(t) ~ρj,

j = 1, 2,

N,

(1)

which are valid in the center of mass reference frame

j mj~rj(t) = 0. We shall refer to a

trajectory satisfying Eq.(1) as SC. The time-independent vectors ~ρj describe the shape of

the SC, while the function φ(t) gives the overall scaling factor. We will see below that this

function monotonically increases in time thus ensuring that all distances increase as well.

Therefore this type of motion deﬁnitely results in total fragmentation avoiding traps into

potential valleys. It is convenient to normalize the scaling function to unity for some initial

· · ·

P

5

moment of time t0

For this normalization the vectors ~ρj play a role of coordinates of the particles at this initial

moment of time ~rj(t0) = ~ρj in the center of mass reference frame

Notice that in SC all degrees of freedom except the only one describing the overall scaling

factor are frozen. In this sense the SC describes a quasiequilibrium of the system.

It is obvious that to satisfy (1) one should choose appropriately the initial coordinates

~ρj. Let us formulate restrictions on them. Notice ﬁrst of all that in the SC the accelerations

of the particles are

φ(t0) = 1.

mj~ρj = 0.

We presume purely Coulomb interaction, or consider Coulomb asymptote in more compli-

cated cases, which is possible because the important distances are large (r

rC = 1/E) for

low above-threshold energy. Therefore the potential energy of the system of N fragments is

It is easy to see that it can be satisﬁed only if two conditions are fulﬁlled. Firstly, the scaling

where α > 0 is a time-independent constant which is discussed in detail below. One obviously

recognizes in (8) the equation describing a one-dimensional motion of a particle with unite

mass and unite charge in the attractive Coulomb ﬁeld created by the charge α. Secondly,

the validity of (7) needs that the vectors ~ρj satisfy the following system of equations

They state that accelerations of each fragment ~aj is proportional to its coordinate vector at

the initial moment of time. Eqs.(9) are shown to arise as conditions which are necessary for

existence of SC. It is easy to see that they provide suﬃcient conditions as well. To verify this

statement let us assume that we have a solution of (9). Then we can consider a trajectory

with the following initial conditions. Firstly, we can choose initial coordinates as ~rj(t0) = ~ρj.

Secondly, we can always choose initial velocities be proportional to coordinates

where β is some positive constant which depends on the energy, β

√E. From (9) we ﬁnd

∼

that accelerations at the initial moment of time are also proportional to coordinates

Thus for the considered trajectory both the velocities and accelerations linearly depend on

coordinates at the initial moment of time. Combining this fact with the Newton equations

of motion we conclude that the velocities (and accelerations) remain to be proportional to

the coordinates for any moment of time

Here β(t) is some positive function, β(t0) = β. Integrating (12) we conclude that the time

variation of distances does exhibit scaling condition (1), in which ˙φ(t) = β(t).

This discussion shows that the SC (1) exists if and only if Eqs.(9) are satisﬁed. There

are N vector variables ~ρj, j = 1, 2,

N and one scalar variable α in these equations.

· · ·

Obviously not all of them are independent because there are seven transformations which

do not change the given SC. Three of them correspond to shifts of the SC center of mass.

Three others describe rotations of the SC as a whole. One more transformation describes

the overall scaling of SC

with λ > 0. According to Eq.(8) the scaling of α (14) should be accompanied by a corre-

sponding scaling of φ(t), namely φ(t)

φ′(t) = λ−1φ(t). Notice that the latter transforma-

tion can be interpreted as a shift of the initial moment of time

where according to Eq.(2) t′

It is easy to see that Eqs.(9) remain invariant under the discussed above seven transforma-

tions, i.e. the shifts, rotations and scaling, allowing one to consider them as a set of 3N

equations for 3N

7 independent variables. When solving these equations it is convenient to

−

treat α as a constant parameter which governs the overall scale and can be chosen arbitrary

(for example α = 1).

The interesting for us physical events take place if there is enough Coulomb attraction in

the system. That is why we suppose that the eﬀective Coulomb charge

Q0 is attractive,

Q0 > 0, resulting in positive value of α.

Eqs.(19),(20),(21) show that arbitrary scaling of α can be compensated for by the cor-

responding scaling of coordinates ρj. This fact agrees with Eqs.(13),(14).

where E is the system energy. Combined with the initial condition φ(t0) = 1 this ﬁxes the

scaling function unambiguously.

It is important to emphasize that Eqs.(1), (9) present the idea of SC in an invariant form

independent of the chosen coordinate frame. To see this more clearly let us introduce grand

vectors in the 3N dimensional conﬁguration space. The grand vector r(t) = (~r1(t),

~rN (t))

deﬁnes the time-dependent coordinates, the vector ρ = (~ρ1,

~ρN ) gives the initial coor-

· · ·

dinates and a = (~a1,

~aN ) is the vector of accelerations at the initial moment of time.

· · ·

We employ bold type to distinguish such a vector from the conventional vector in space.

Eqs.(1),(9) allow the following presentation

9

Obviously, these relations between 3N-vectors do not depend on a reference frame. This

shows that the scaling coordinate φ(t) is described in an invariant way.

It has been presumed by previous authors that some coordinate which describes frag-

mentation is to be singled out and the potential extremum point is to be found for the ﬁxed

value of this “break-up coordinate”. The latter has been chosen in most cases as the system

hyperradius [36] [37] [38] [39] deﬁned as R2 =

N
i=1 mir2

i . In the hyper-coordinate reference

frame the potential energy

is proportional to hypercharge C(ω) which depends on a set of hyperangles ω =

(23)

(25)

(26)

which shows that a SC is a saddle-point of the hypercharge C(ω). The function φ(t) in

hyperspherical coordinates is proportional to the hyperradius φ(t) = R/R0, where R0 is

the initial value of the hyperradius. The eﬀective charge

C0/R0 where C0 is

the hypercharge evaluated for SC. Description of the system in the hyper-coordinates has

a long tradition and list of achievements, see for the example recent calculations of the

three-electron atom in hyperspherical coordinates [40]. However, generally speaking, these

coordinates do not possess fundamental advantages over other coordinate frames for the

fragmentation problem.

Another well known reference frame provide Jacoby coordinates used in the approach

developed by Feagin [41]. For the multiparticle fragmentation the choice of the “break-up

coordinate” is not obvious and some special procedure was developed for its construction

10

[29] [30] [19]. It becomes the more sophisticated problem the more complicated the system

is.

In conclusion of this Section it should be stressed once more that our approach provides

an invariant deﬁnition for the idea of SC which is given in (23), (24).

III. SMALL DEVIATIONS FROM SCALING CONFIGURATION

Assuming that the function φ(t) is deﬁned as described in the preceding section, we

switch from ~rj to the new coordinates δ~rj

~rj = φ(t) ~ρj + δ~rj

which have an obvious meaning of deviations from the SC. Presuming that these deviations

are small, we write down linearized classical Newtonian equations for δ~rj(t) as

which becomes time-independent for E = 0. In this case the time-dependence is exactly

factored out in the Hamiltonian (32) justifying the choice of the scaling (31). This implies

that the original non-stationary problem becomes stationary provided one replaces time t

by an eﬀective time τ . A relation between t and τ in diﬀerential form is

dτ = φ(t)−3/2 dt.

(35)

For some applications it is necessary to keep the energy dependence of the trajectory. For

these cases a convenient technique has been developed recently by Kuchiev [17]. We have

applied it to the case considered and veriﬁed that it results in the same threshold indexes

as the ones obtained below by the stationary approach.

The Hamiltonian δHτ (36) is quadratic in coordinates and momenta thus describing a

set of harmonic oscillators or inverted oscillators. This shows that our goal is to describe

the behavior of the system in terms of these oscillators and inverted oscillators. Before

proceeding we modify our notation. The set of components of the displacements vectors δ~rj

(j = 1, 2, . . . N) comprise 3N-dimensional grand vector δr. In this formulation, for instance,

Vij corresponds to grand 3N

3N square matrix denoted below as V. We introduce also

×

12

3N

3N unit matrix I and the diagonal matrix K of the same size with diagonal elements

×

corresponding to inverse mass 1/mj of each particle.

This notation takes into account an obvious fact that the total number of all modes

coincides with the number of degrees of freedom in the system (k = 1, 2, . . . 3N). There

are however seven particular degrees of freedom: translations, rotations and the scaling

transformation. They do not change the shape of a SC and do not describe a deviation from

a SC. These degrees of freedom may be called the collective modes. They obviously should be

considered separately from the oscillating modes which describe deviations from the SC. In

order to distinguish the collective modes one can use the following interesting property. All

collective degrees of freedom are described by the eigenvectors of the grand matrix KV with

particular eigenvalues. Firstly, the three modes which correspond to the system translations

in space have obviously zero eigenvalues. Secondly, the modes corresponding to rotations of

the system in space have eigenvalues equal to

Q0/
such modes in general case, while for a linear SC there are only two modes. Thirdly, the

, as shown in Appendix. There are three

M
as also shown in Appendix. Using these eigenvalues one can separate the collective modes

Q0/

2
−

,

either from the very beginning, or at the end of calculations.

There is another useful for applications way to separate the collective modes. For trans-

lations and rotations the separation can be fulﬁlled by conventional methods choosing ap-

propriately the coordinates, as is demonstrated in a number of examples below. Separation

of the scaling mode can be achieved with the help of the operator of projection on this

mode P and the complementary projection operator Q = I

P. The operator P is readily

−

constructed from the unit vectors ~nj = ~ρj/ρj which deﬁne the shape of SC:

Pij = ~ni ·

~nj.

(38)

Thus all seven collective modes can be easily identiﬁes and separated using any of the two

techniques described above.

Some modes in the 3N

7 subspace orthogonal to the collective modes are stable and

−

13

describe small oscillations around SC; the related oscillating frequencies ωk are real. The

object of our major interest is unstable modes with imaginary oscillating frequencies. It is

shown below that unstable modes exist for any SC. It is convenient to introduce for unstable

modes a parameter αk = iωk (Re αk > 0). In order to ﬁnd the oscillating frequencies one

can presume a harmonic time-dependence of the coordinates ξ and momenta π

ξ = exp(iωt) Ξ,

π = exp(iωt) Π,

(39)

where Ξ and Π are time-independent grand vectors. The Hamiltonian equations of motion

give

matrix K V always possesses negative eigenvalues which describe instability. Consider the

We see that the spectrum of the matrix K V always contains both positive and negative

eigenvalues. This fact in itself is not suﬃcient to make a statement about instability because

the trace (47) includes contribution from collective modes which do not change a shape of

the SC. However, it is easy to exclude collective modes. Remember that the eigenvalues

corresponding to translations are zero, rotations give eigenvalues

Since this trace is non-positive, we conclude that the matrix K V inevitably possesses nega-

This property is closely related to the fact that harmonic functions, i.e. those which satisfy

orem well known in electrostatics: stable equilibrium is impossible for systems where the

Coulomb forces are operative. Although SCs describe expanding non-static conﬁgurations,

conclusion about inevitable instability remains valid in this case as well. This fact can be

interpreted as a dynamic analogue of the Earnshow theorem.

IV. QUANTIZATION OF DEVIATIONS FROM SCALING CONFIGURATION

where we omit the common time-dependent phase factor. The wave function is prepared at

some initial moment t0 by preceding strong interaction of all fragments. In the Wannier-

type approach it is presumed that these processes depend smoothly on the energy E. Hence

they do not inﬂuence the form of threshold law and thus could be eﬀectively excluded from

consideration; it is suﬃcient to consider only t > t0 domain.

For unstable modes the ’energies’ ǫknk are complex-valued which leads to the loss of

probability in the expanding SC. This should be interpreted [34] [35] as sliding from the

potential saddle in multidimensional conﬁguration space that eventually leads to formation

of bound states of two (or more) fragments. Such an outcome implies that the related part

our study. Cross section of the latter is proportional to the survival probability

problem is stationary. The time t in (52) plays a role of an eﬀective variable which describes

scaling of the system in accordance with (22). Small deviations from SC are described

quantum mechanically. Our treatment generalizes to multimode case the scheme developed

by Kazansky and Ostrovsky [4] for the two-electron escape (see also Ref. [12]; some of ideas

used were elaborated also by Watanabe [2]). Note that the cited paper [4] provides also a

description of deviations from pure power threshold law, but we do not pursue this point

here.

For our objectives it is suﬃcient to note that (52) has a form of a product of contributions

coming from each individual mode, hence the threshold law of interest is

ulated by the processes in the inner interaction domain. Clearly, the threshold law is deﬁned

by the least possible values of nk [42] which are equal to zero unless the symmetry consid-

is invariant under simultaneous scaling of all charges or all masses in the system.

In the original Wannier problem two electrons escape from inﬁnitely heavy atomic core

with the charge Z. The conﬁguration found by Wannier [1] gives the simplest example of SC

in which the electrons reside at equal distances ρ and in opposite directions from the core.

The motion is unstable with respect to the stretching mode which is separated from the

(stable) bending mode. Thus it is suﬃcient for our purposes to consider motion of electrons

along the line passing through the core. This motion is described by two coordinates and

the matrix V takes the form

The choice n1 = 0 provides the famous Wannier law valid for 1S symmetry of the ﬁnal

two-electron continuum state, whereas n1 = 1 corresponds to the threshold law for 3Se (and

3P e) symmetry [43].

Feagin and Filipczyk [29] and Poelstra el al [30] put forward another formula for the

threshold index in the multimode case. According to it the Wannier index is (N

2) times

larger than (54). The factor (N

2) is described as a “phase space factor for (N

were unable to ﬁnd the derivation of such a factor in the cited paper; anyway it deals only

with the conventional N = 3 case where the factor (N

2) is insigniﬁcant. Our treatment

provides purely dynamic approximation for the wave function and does not leave any room

for the statistical arguments. The other aspects of relation between dynamic and statistical

threshold laws are discussed in Section VI.

V. PARTICULAR SYSTEMS

In practical applications of our scheme the less obvious part corresponds to ﬁnding SCs.

Numerical solution of the set of non-linear equations (9) could be cumbersome and implies

reasonable initial guess. The question whether all the solutions are found is even more

diﬃcult.

In reality one has to appeal to intuitive reasoning and to limit search to some

symmetrical conﬁguration. This allows one to eﬀectively reduce the number of equations

(9) to be considered. Since the initial step of ﬁnding SC in most cases could not be done

in closed form, we do not pursue the goal of obtaining analytical formulae, but resort to

numerical calculations which are performed using the Mathematica [44] program. We ﬁnd it

easier to avoid preliminary separation of rotational and translational coordinates, since they

could be easily distinguished in the eigensystem of the complete matrix K V. Moreover, the

known eigenvalues of this matrix corresponding to rotations (see Appendix) provide a good

test for consistency of calculations.

The systems practically accessible nowadays in atomic physics are not very diverse,

consisting of several electrons and positrons in the ﬁeld of heavy (positively charged) atomic

core. Since three-particle systems (such as A+Z + 2e− or A+Z + e− + e+) are already studied

in great detail [1] [38] [39] [45] [46] [47] [33] (see also references in the Introduction), we start

from the four-particle systems. We do not impose any symmetry constraints on the system

state thus presuming that nk = 0 for all modes contributing µ (54).

A. Three-electron escape from the charged core

The system A+Z + 3e was thoroughly investigated by Klar and Schlecht [22] and Gruji´c

[24]. They considered a conﬁguration of electrons forming an equilateral triangle with in-

19

ﬁnitely massive core in the center, which is obviously a SC. The out-of-plane motion is

separated. It corresponds to stable modes and does not aﬀect the threshold law. The in-

plane motion is described by six coordinates of electrons, or by four ’oscillatory’ modes plus

uniform expansion of SC and its rotation. The eigenfrequencies obtained by us, as well as in

the cited papers, are pairwise degenerate due to SC symmetry. One pair corresponds to sta-

ble motion and the other pair to unstable motion. The latter pair produces two equal terms

in the sum (54). Klar and Schlecht [22] and Gruji´c [24] succeeded in deriving analytical

expressions for the Wannier index [48]. In this paper we do not pursue analytical formu-

lations but check that our numerical results coincide with those cited by Gruji´c, namely

µ = 2.82624 for Z = 1, µ = 2.27043 for Z = 2, µ = 2.16196 for Z = 3, etc. The experiment

for electron impact double ionization of atoms (Z = 3) seem to agree with the threshold law

The two pairs of modes discussed above are already well known. Combined with rotation

and scaling expansion they represent a complete set of six in-plane coordinates. Since the

number of modes is a physical parameter which is independent on the theoretical technique

used, we do not see any possibility to obtain some additional unstable modes which would

lead to another Wannier index and thus to the complementary threshold law as announced

by Feagin and Filipczyk [29] (in fact our conclusion could be drawn from the paper by Gruji´c

[24] who used the plain Cartesian coordinates whereas less transparent treatment by Klar

and Schlecht [22] is based on hyperspherical coordinates). Since no details of analysis by

Feagin and Filipczyk [29] were ever published, more detailed discussion of this issue is not

[28].

possible.

B. 2e− + e+ escape from the charged core

The plausible symmetric SCs for the system A+Z + 2e− + e+ were considered by Poel-

stra et al [30] (note that the calculations in this paper were carried out only for Z = 1).

They comprise two diﬀerent linear arrangements and one plain conﬁguration [49]. All these

20

conﬁgurations belong to SC and therefore can be easily handled by the developed above

technique. We consider below these SCs successively.

1. Linear conﬁguration La

Let the frame origin is placed into inﬁnitely massive core having the charge Z. The

coordinates of two electrons and positron are respectively x1, x2, x3; all of them are positive.

It is convenient to introduce two dimensionless parameters x = r1/r3 and y = r2/r3 (0 <

x < 1 < y) which have to satisfy the system of equations obtained from (9)

A distinction from the previous case is that the coordinate of one of the electrons is

negative (x2 < 0). The system of equations deﬁning SC is somewhat diﬀerent (y < 0 < x <

For both linear conﬁgurations the bending modes are stable. There are two stretching modes

for each conﬁguration, both being unstable. The results of our calculations are summarized

in table 1. For Z = 1 parameters x, y and partial threshold indices µ1 and µ2 coincide with

those obtained by Poelstra et al [30]; our threshold indices µ are less by a factor of 2, as

discussed at the end of Section IV. Notice a non-trivial behaviour of the parameters with Z:

21

for instance, in SC La, x and µ1 increase with Z, whereas y and µ2 decrease. The threshold

index µ increases with Z which is opposite to the well known behaviour for the simplest

system (AZ + 2e) and for 3e escape where µ diminishes as Z grows (see more discussion in

the Section VI).

3. Plane conﬁguration P

The symmetric plane conﬁguration is conveniently characterized by two angles α and

β: α is an angle between two lines which join the ion with the positron and one of the

electrons, while β is an angle between two lines which join the positron with the ion and

with one of the electrons. In the considered plane conﬁguration the two electrons are located

symmetrically, which means that their locations mirrow each other under reﬂection in an

axes which joins the ion and the positron. This makes the angles α and β be identical for

both electrons. From (9) we deduce the system of equations

where the masses of light particles with negative (m−) and positive (m+) charges generally

could be diﬀerent. The results of calculations are presented in table 1. For Z = 1 the angles

α and β coincide with these extracted from the paper by Poelstra et al

[30]. However,

the diﬀerence between the threshold indices is drastic. Poelstra et al had found a single

unstable mode which corresponds to our partial Wannier index µ2. Our calculations give

two unstable modes, similarly to the case of 3e escape (in the latter case the modes were

degenerate due to a symmetry which is absent for the system under consideration). The

reason of this disagreement remains unclear.

The plane SC P governs the threshold behaviour, although it provides the threshold

index µ only slightly less than the linear conﬁguration Lb.

22

C. Four-electron escape from the charged core

Basing on the symmetry considerations we analyze three conﬁgurations:

linear, plane

and 3D SC. It could be shown rigorously that for symmetric linear arrangement SC does

not exist for all values of Z, i.e. Eqs.(9) have no solution.

1. Plane conﬁguration P

In the plane conﬁguration the electrons are located in the apexes of a square; the core

lies in its center. The out-of-plane motion is separated and corresponds to stable modes.

For in-plane motion in general case we ﬁnd one non-degenerate and one doubly-degenerate

unstable modes (table 2). For the particular case Z = 1 an additional non-degenerate mode

becomes unstable.

2. 3D conﬁguration V

SC describes the electrons located at the apexes of tetrahedron. We ﬁnd a single triply-

degenerate mode (table 2). Interestingly, the threshold index µ proves to be quite close for

plane and 3D conﬁgurations, although 3D SC provides somewhat lower value of µ and thus

governs the threshold behaviour. As Z increases, the relative importance of electron-electron

interaction decreases and µ approaches the value µ = 3 which corresponds to non-interacting

electrons.

The smallest practically attainable value of the charge seems to be Z = 2. It could be

realized via triple ionization of negative ion by electron impact. However, theoretically the

case Z = 1 proves be very interesting due to unusual properties. In this case the threshold

index becomes much larger than in other cases, particularly for the plane SC. This is due to

a small value of the ’charge’

Q0 in this case. Another interesting feature is an appearance of
an additional unstable mode in the plane SC. An analysis of the eigenvector Ξ shows that

23

it corresponds to the out-of-plane motion. Namely, a pair of electrons lying on a diagonal

of the square shifts upwards, whereas another pair shifts downwards.

The tetrahedric conﬁguration was considered earlier by Gruji´c [26] who obtained ap-

proximate analytical expressions for the threshold indexes. The partial threshold indexes

obtained by him reveals only an approximate degeneracy. The numerical results for µ are

in reasonable agreement with our data.

D. 3e− + e+ escape from the charged core

We failed to ﬁnd a symmetrical plane SC for this system.

1. Linear conﬁguration L

Linear SC corresponds to alternating positive and negative charges. Let us locate the

origin at the heavy ion and call by x1 > 0, x2 < 0, x3 > x1 > 0 locations of three electrons,

and by x4, x1 < x4 < x3 location of the positron. Then the considered conﬁguration can be

characterized by three parameters: x = x1/x4, y = x2/x4, z = x3/x4 ((y < 0 < x < 1 < z).

They have to satisfy a set of equations which follow from (9)

The parameters of SC and the Wannier indices are shown in table 3.

The symmetrical 3D conﬁguration arises when the three electrons form the equilateral

triangle while the ion and the positron are located up and down the plane of the triangle

24

on the perpendicular to the triangle plane which crosses its center. This conﬁguration is

characterized by two angles α and β deﬁned similar to the case considered in Section B3.

Namely, α is an angle between two lines which join the ion with the positron and with one

of the electrons, while β is an angle between two lines which join the positron with the ion

and with one of the electrons. These angle are diﬁned by equations similar to (59):

We have found two doubly-degenerate and one non-degenerate unstable mode as shown in

table 3. The threshold law is governed by 3D SC V . Note that the threshold index grows

with Z.

E. Five-electron escape from the charged core

1. Plane conﬁguration P

In the plane SC the electrons are located in the apexes of a equilateral pentagon; the

core lies in the same plane. In the in-plane motion we have found two doubly degenerate

unstable modes (table 4). For Z = 2 an additional pair of unstable modes appears.

2. 3D conﬁguration V

Here three electrons lie in the apexes of equilateral triangle with the core in its center.

On the perpendicular to this plane, above the plane and below it, another pair of electrons is

located symmetrically. The SC can be characterized by the angle α between the line which

joins out-of-plane electron with the core and the line which joins it with in-plane electron.

The angle is deﬁned by the equation

Quite unexpectedly, α proves to be very close to 45◦, exhibiting weak dependence on the

core charge Z (table 4). This means that in-plane and out-of-plane electrons are located at

almost the same distance from the core. The 3D SC generates somewhat lower values of µ

than the plane SC thus governing the threshold behaviour. However, the diﬀerence is quite

small. This feature is common to that found above for the four-electron case.

3D conﬁguration for ﬁve-electron system was considered previously by Dmitrievi´c et al

[27]. However, the equation derived for SC angle α diﬀers from (62).

F. Fragmentation in two pairs of identical particles with opposite charges

In this subsection we consider fragmentation into the ﬁnal state 2 X +Z

m + 2e, where X +Z
m

is a positively charged particle with charge Z and mass m (all results below hold if the

electrons are replaced by any other charged particles; then Z and m have the meaning of

ratio of charges and masses respectively).

In the applications considered above the zero

eigenvalues of the matrix V do not emerge due to the presence of inﬁnitely massive core.

In the (2 X +Z

m + 2e) system such modes are present. Another distinction is that for equal

masses of leptons in previous applications we have always had K = I and vk have been the

eigenvalues of the V matrix. Now we have to diagonalize the complete matrix K V. Both

these features do not create substantial diﬃculties.

From the symmetry considerations it is clear that a shape of the SC is a rhombus with

the angle 2α at the apexes where the particles X Z

m are situated. The single SC parameter α

is deﬁned by the equation

which follows from (9). Several examples are shown in table 5. The simplest practical

realization is the complete fragmentation of H2 molecule by photons where α is close to

30◦ in agreement with Feagin and Filipczyk [29] and the threshold index proves to be huge.

26

Apparently this threshold behaviour could not be observed in experiments [50]. Another

feasible realization with moderate Wannier index is ionization of negative positronium ion

by positron impact (Z = 1, m =1).

We fail to ﬁnd the linear conﬁguration discussed by Stevens and Feagin [31].

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

This paper formulates the idea of the SC. Deﬁned by (1), the SC is shown to arise

when a nonlinear set of Eqs.(9) is satisﬁed. Propagation of the system in the vicinity of

SC conﬁguration governs the threshold law which is found in Eqs.(53),(54) and (55). These

results permit direct practical calculations of the threshold index µ for any system.

In many cases the threshold laws in quantum mechanics can be deduced from general

considerations without dynamical treatment. For instance, the break-up cross section with

N fragments in the ﬁnal state and a short range interaction between them could be estimated

from simple phase-space volume (i.e. statistical) arguments as

If one presumes that all fragments (“electrons”) are attracted by Coulomb forces to one

fragment (“core”), but the interaction between the “electrons” is negligible, then the phase

space arguments could be easily modiﬁed to give

(64)

(65)

In case of repulsive Coulomb interaction with the “core” (but still without other inter-

fragment interactions) the cross section at the threshold becomes exponentially small, as

obtained, for example, by Geltman [51] in his calculations for atom ionization by positron

impact with all correlation neglected. The threshold behaviour changes to

E3/2 [52] if

∼

one employs the so called 3C wave functions for the ﬁnal continuum state. However, these

functions do not ensure proper description in the near-threshold domain.

If one aims to obtain a correct threshold law for the Coulomb system, then the interaction

between the fragments, i.e. the particle correlation is to be taken into account. This makes

the phase-space arguments insuﬃcient, but requires dynamical treatment as it was originally

done by Wannier [1] for the simplest system.

In this paper we employ the most simple

theoretical apparatus presenting the essential equations in an arbitrary coordinate frame.

They remain valid, in particular, in the simplest single-particle Cartesian coordinates.

As discussed in Section IV, Poelstra et al [30] suggested another formula for the Wannier

index which diﬀers from our Eq.(54) by the extra “phase factor” (N

2). This discrepancy

−

remains hidden when one restricts consideration to the case of two, three, or four electrons

receding from the positively charged core. In these cases the unstable mode proves to be

respectively non-degenerate, doubly- and triply-degenerate. Thus the degree of degeneracy

in these cases coincides with (N

2). This fortuitously allows one to replace the summation

−

over degenerate modes implied by formula (54) by multiplication over the factor (N

−
2) which corresponds to the formula by Poelstra et al [30]. However this coincidence is

accidental and misleading. It is broken, for instance, by variation of charges and masses of the

constituent particles which violates SCs symmetry and hence lifts the modes degeneracy, or

by considering larger numbers of particles N (simply because possible degrees of degeneracy

are restricted by properties of the point groups in 3D space). For ﬁve electrons receding

from a charged core only doubly degenerate unstable modes were found above.

Physically it is clear that if the charge of the core Z in the system AZ +(N

1) e becomes

bigger, then the interelectron correlations should become less important and the threshold

law should approach the value obtained from the phase-space arguments, i.e. µ

(N

2)

as Z

. This conclusion is supported by all examples considered. Moreover in all these

−

→

−

→ ∞

examples one can note that:

the number of unstable modes accounting for their degeneracy (i.e. the number of

terms in the sum (54)) is equal to (N

2);

each partial Wannier index µk0 (55) tends to unity from above as Z increases.

in the plane A+Z + 4e SC for Z = 1. However, this SC provides µ larger than 3D SC and

therefore it does not govern the threshold behaviour. Note that although these properties

are physically very natural, it is not clear if they can be proven rigorously from the ﬁrst

principles. An additional observation is that the electrons in SC tend to be distributed

uniformly on the sphere, even when the corresponding perfectly symmetrical body does not

exist (see ﬁve-electron case above). For large number of electrons in the ﬁeld of the core

several competing SC are found to produce very close threshold indices. Still, in all the cases

considered the leading SC is found to be the three-dimensional one.

These results hopefully should hold if the electrons are replaced by other (possibly dif-

ferent) negatively charged particles. However, the situation changes drastically if one of the

“electrons” is replaced by a particle of positive charge, for example, positron. It is essential

that an additional repulsive Coulomb interaction appears in the system. If correlations are

neglected then the cross section decreases exponentially as E approaches threshold. One

could expect that although the true threshold law retains a power character for all values of

Z, it tends to mock the exponential behaviour by increasing of µ value [53]. This property

holds for all positron-containing systems considered above. The threshold index increases

with Z quite slowly. In order to illustrate the later point quantitatively we cite results for

A+Z + 2e− + e+ system with very large values of Z (cf. Sec. VB): µ = 9.4 for Z = 50

(α = 5.60◦, β = 37.2◦); µ = 11.6 for Z = 100 (α = 3.95◦, β = 37.8◦). In general terms

one can argue that a similar situation should arise when a system contains two or more

positively charged particles and two or more particles with negative charge. Note that the

properties of the partial Wannier indices µk0 are less straightforward: some of them could

be less than unity and vary with Z non-monotonically.

Large values of threshold indexes µ are unfavorable for an experimental observation of

the threshold behaviour: close to the threshold the cross section proves to be too small

to be observable, and for higher excess energies the intrinsic deviations from the threshold

law become essential. An analysis of the energy domain where the threshold law holds is

29

beyond the scope of this paper. Still, we can note that for the electron-impact ionization of

atoms or for double photoionization this domain is limited to few eV above threshold (for

quantitative treatment within the Wannier mechanism see Refs. [4] [12]). For the positron-

impact ionization the applicability domain is even less [12] [13]. As argued by Ihra et al [18],

an agreement with experimental data could be substantially improved if the interaction of

diﬀerent modes in the deviation from SC is taken into account. Possibly some procedure

to assess for the mode interaction could be developed also for the multifragment system;

the present development provides a necessary ﬁrst step for more advanced approaches. One

could note also that even very large threshold indices could (quite unexpectedly) be useful

for constructing formulae of interpolation character as shown in the recent paper by Rost

and Pattard [20].

APPENDIX A: EIGENVALUES OF V MATRIX CORRESPONDING TO

ROTATIONS AND TRANSLATIONS IN TIME

If the N-particle system is rotated as a whole over inﬁnitisemal (time-independent) angle

δϕ around the axis ~ν, then the particle coordinates receive increments

δ~r (ν)

j = (~ν

~rj) δϕ.

×

(A1)

The form of Newtonian equations of motion

30

remains invariant under rotations. This implies that

where δ~rj = δ~r (ν)

. For SC one can use Eqs.(A1) and (1) to get

Bearing in mind that according to (18)

and using deﬁnition (29), we ﬁnally obtain

which means that the grand vector δr (ν) is an eigenvector of the grand matrix K V with the

eigenvalue

. Generally there are three eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue,

Q0/

M

but for a linear SCs only two independent rotations are possible.

Consider now variation of the trajectory caused by shifting of time over an inﬁnitesimal

interval t

t + δt using similar technique. For the system in SC the particle coordinates

are incremented in this case by

δ~r (SC)

The form of Newtonian equations of motion obviously remains invariant under the shift of

the time variable. Therefore (A3) remains valid for δ~rj = δ~r (SC)

(Dated: July 11, 2003)

We formulate an effective theory for the atom-mediated photon-photon interactions in a two-dimensional
“photon ﬂuid” conﬁned in a Fabry-Perot resonator. With the atoms modelled by a collection of anharmonic
Lorentz oscillators, the effective interaction is evaluated to second order in the coupling constant (the anhar-
monicity parameter). The interaction has the form of a renormalized two-dimensional delta-function potential,
with the renormalization scale determined by the physical parameters of the system, such as density of atoms
and the detuning of the photons relative to the resonance frequency of the atoms. For realistic values of the
parameters, the perturbation series has to be resummed, and the effective interaction becomes independent of
the “bare” strength of the anharmonic term. The resulting expression for the non-linear Kerr susceptibility, is
parametrically equal to the one found earlier for a dilute gas of two-level atoms. Using our result for the effec-
tive interaction parameter, we derive conditions for the formation of a photon ﬂuid, both for Rydberg atoms in
a microwave cavity and for alkali atoms in an optical cavity.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum physics in two-dimensions has many interesting features which give rise to effects that cannot be seen in three-
dimensional systems. One of the most interesting two-dimensional effects is the formation of incompressible electron ﬂuids
that characterize the plateau states of the quantum Hall effect [1]. Also high temperature superconductivity is believed to be
essentially a two-dimensional effect.

The interest in the physics of low-dimensional systems has motivated both theoretical and experimental searches for new kinds
of two-dimensional many-body systems. In the case of weakly interacting Bose-condensed atomic gases, two-dimensionality
can be reached in highly asymmetric traps [2], and quantum states similar to the quantum Hall states have been predicted for
such systems when in rapid rotation [3].

Another idea that has been advocated by one of us [4, 5] is that photons also, under speciﬁc conditions in photonic traps, can
form a two-dimensional system of weakly interacting particles with an effective mass determined by the (ﬁxed) momentum in
the suppressed dimension. Such a photon gas can in principle undergo phase transitions, much like a cold atomic gas, and can
in a condensed phase sustain vortices and sound excitations, in a manner similar to that of an ordinary superﬂuid.

This picture of the photons as a two-dimensional ﬂuid has been based on the (effective) Maxwell theory of electromagnetic
waves in a non-linear medium where only one longitudinal mode inside a cavity is excited by an incoming laser beam. The
corresponding mean ﬁeld equation has the same form as the Gross-Pitaevski equation, or the non-linear Schr¨odinger equation
with a quartic non-linearity, and when coupled to an external driving ﬁeld it has been referred to as the Luigiato-Lefever (LL)
equation. The LL equation has been used to discuss the apparence of transverse patterns in the light trapped inside Fabry-Perot
and ring cavities [6].

The LL equation is a non-linear classical ﬁeld equation, but it can also be interpreted as a quantum ﬁeld theory with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld as an operator ﬁeld. The non-linear term is then viewed as a short range (δ-function) photon-photon
interaction. This interpretation is the basis for the photon ﬂuid idea, and it has implications beyond the classical non-linear
optics description.

However, the interpretation of the non-linear ﬁeld equation as a quantum theory raises several questions. One has to do with
the dimensional reduction itself. When only the fundamental longitudinal mode is excited there is clearly an effective reduction
of dimension, since the dynamics is restricted to the two transverse directions. This corresponds to the situation where the cavity
is small, with a length in the longitudinal direction of the order of half a wave length. In the optical regime such a resonator is
extremely small, and even if it can be made in principle, a simpler realization of a small resonator is in the microwave regime in
conjunction with Rydberg atoms which can couple strongly to the microwave photons. For the cavities that are presently used in
laser experiments the longitudinal mode is highly excited relative to the fundamental mode, and in this case two-dimensionality
is obtained only as long as the scattering to other longitudinal modes can be neglected.

Another question concerns the photon-photon scattering [7]. A two-dimensional delta-function interaction is only well deﬁned
to lowest order in perturbation theory, and in a full quantum description such a short range interaction is meaningful only as a
renormalized interaction. This implies that the scattering amplitude is determined by a renormalization length in addition to the

interaction strength. In the effective photon theory this is not a free parameter, but should be determined by the full microscopic
theory of the photons interacting with the atoms of the non-linear medium.

In this work we will address the ﬁrst question simply by assuming that only one longitudinal mode is excited. Our main
objective will then be to examine the photon-photon interaction from a microscopic point of view. Of particular interest is
to examine in what sense the effective interaction can be interpreted as a delta function interaction and to determine how the
renormalized strength of the interaction depends on the physical parameters of the system.

The approach we will take is to derive the effective photon theory from from the full quantum theory of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and the non-linear medium, rather than from a macroscopic description of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. However, we will use
the simpliﬁed model of the atoms in the medium as a collection of Lorentz oscillators supplemented by a quartic oscillator term
to account for the non-linearity [8]. At the quantum level, the linear Lorentz oscillator model yields “polaritons” as the coupled
atom-photon degrees of freedom, as shown by Hopﬁeld and others [9, 10].

In the next section (2) we use the Feynman path-integral method to ﬁnd an expression for the interaction between the physical
modes of the coupled photon-oscillator system in terms of an effective photon action. In Section 3 we consider the effective
theory for the low-lying transverse momentum modes in a cavity where only the lowest longitudinal mode is excited, and derive
the corresponding two-dimensional low-energy effective action. In the following section (4), we summarize the question of
how to correctly describe the renormalized delta function interaction in two dimensions. Then in Section 5, we relate this to
an evaluation of quantum corrections to the effective interaction (to second order in the coupling parameter) and determine
the leading logarithmic corrections to the scattering amplitude. In Section 6 we summarize the physical scales and discuss
the conditions under which interesting quantum phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation and the formation of two-photon
bound states may take place. In section 7 we examine two possible scenarios for experimental realizations of a 2D photon
ﬂuid. Based on order of magnitude estimates, we discuss under what conditions a photon ﬂuid in thermal equilibrium may form
for millimeter-wave photons interacting with Rydberg atoms and for optical photons interacting with alkali atoms. Both cases
might offer possibilities to observe genuine quantum effects in an interacting photon gas, although our estimates indicate severe
constraints on the physical parameters. We close this section by discussing a third possible scenario, in which a 2D photon ﬂuid
forms just inside the surface of a high-Q microsphere of glass. Concluding remarks are found in Section 8.

2 THE EFFECTIVE PHOTON ACTION

For photons interacting off resonance with the atoms (i.e., the oscillators), the atoms have two types of effects on the scattered
photons. There is a linear effect, where the elastic scattering off the atoms changes the dispersion of the photons. For photons
with low transverse momentum in the cavity, this leads to a renormalization of the effective mass of the photons, which without
the atoms is determined by the (ﬁxed) longitudinal photon momentum ¯hkL, as m0 = ¯hkL/c. The other effect is the non-linear
or anharmonic effect of the photon-atom interaction, which gives rise to the effective photon-photon interaction.

There are several ways to derive the effective photon action from the full quantum theory of photons and oscillators, all based
on the assumption that the non-linear term is small and can be treated as a perturbation. One way is to solve, as the ﬁrst step,
the linear part of the problem exactly by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. As the next step the non-linear terms can be expressed
in terms of the transformed, decoupled variables; in this way the resonance problems, which would appear in a more direct
perturbative treatment, are avoided. However, another simpler approach which we will adopt here, is to derive the effective
action of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by use of the Feynman path integral method, where a (non-local) ﬁeld transformation yields
the result without any matrix diagonalization. To check the result of this method we have also performed, in Appendix A, a
decoupling of the linear variables by matrix diagonalization, and show that this can be done in a way that is substantially simpler
than the standard method.

In this section we do not impose the cavity boundary conditions, which later will be used as constraints on the effective photon

modes in order to derive a dimensionally reduced theory.

We start from the total classical action

to the integration over

D0(ω1) this correction term vanishes.

Note that the expansion and re-exponentiation of the non-linear term will generate correction terms, but these are higher order
in Λ and will be neglected. Thus, to ﬁrst order in Λ, the effective action is given by the quadratic part (8) and the quartic term
(9).

The effective action deﬁned by (8) and (9) corresponds to a Lagrangian that is non-local in time. However by a further
transformation it can be brought into a local form. We ﬁrst note that the quadratic part of the action deﬁnes a modiﬁed dispersion

The dependence on ω2 shows that the transformed action corresponds to a Lagrangian that is local in time. The non-locality in
time has been traded for a non-locality in space, but this is less problematic in a Lagrangian formulation. Note, however, the
ambiguity in the transformations (13), depending of which one of the solutions ω± we choose. Clearly, the relevant choice is the
one which ﬁts the energy of the photons in the effective theory. This means ω− for the case of red detuning (energy below ω0)
and ω+ for blue detuning (energy above ω0).

When the transformed ﬁeld is introduced in the quartic part of the effective action we make a further simpliﬁcation by assuming

that the ﬁelds satisfy the dispersion equation of the linear problem. This allows the following substitution

The application of the dispersion equation to the ﬁeld variables of the interaction term can be justiﬁed when this term is used
perturbatively, with the ﬁelds satisfying the ﬁeld equation of the unperturbed system. However, it is interesting to note that the
expression (16) in fact is valid beyond this approximation, as is demonstrated by the diagonalization of the quadratic problem
performed in Appendix A.

3 DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION AND THE EFFECTIVE 2D φ4 THEORY

Due to the boundary conditions imposed by the mirrors, the component of the photon momentum normal to the mirrors (the
longitudinal momentum) is quantized at discrete values. We assume an idealized situation with inﬁnite ﬂat mirrors, thus the

FIG. 1: Dispersion curves for the photon like and dipole like excitations. Fig 1a shows the curves for red detuning (∆ = ω0 − m > 0),
where the photon branch corresponds to the curve ω− for low momentum k and to ω+ for high momentum. Fig 1b shows the curves for blue
detuning (∆ = ω0 − m < 0), where the photon branch corresponds to ω+ for all momenta. The curves are shown in dimensionless units with
|∆| = 1. The parameter values are ω0 = 100 and η = 0.1.

longitudinal momenta are quantized as kL = πn/L, with L as the distance between the mirrors and n as an integer. We also
assume photons to be fed to the cavity by a laser (or maser) tuned close to resonance with one of the modes, either slightly
below (red detuning), or slightly above the resonance (blue detuning). However, we do not take the effect of photons entering or
departing the cavity explicitly into account, and in this sense we consider an idealized situation with perfectly reﬂecting mirrors.
All the photons inside the cavity are assumed to be trapped in the same longitudinal mode, and throughout the paper we will
assume this to be the lowest mode n = 1.

The transverse components of the photon momentum ~k we assume to be restricted to small values, kT << kL. The disper-
sion of free (non-interacting) photons inside the Fabry-Perot resonator becomes essentially that of 2D massive, non-relativistic
particles [4],

with the longitudinal momentum kL playing the role of the photon mass. The dimensional reduction is then based on the
assumption that only one longitudinal mode (the lowest) is excited, and that scattering to other modes can be neglected. We
should stress that this does not mean that higher modes are not important as virtual states in the perturbative expansion - in fact
they are.

For simplicity we shall in the following refer to the transverse momentum simply as kT ≡
When the coupling between the photons and the oscillators is taken into account, the dispersion equation is given by (12), and
the relation between ~k and ω(k) is no longer so simple. In Fig.1a ω−(k) and ω+(k) are shown as functions of the transverse
momentum for red detuning, which is the case we will ﬁrst consider. It displays how for small momenta, ω−(k) corresponds to
the “photon branch” with quadratic dependence on k, while for large momenta the photon branch is represented by ω+(k) . In
the following we will simply refer to excitations of this mode as “photons” and the other one as “dipoles”. Due to the mixing
there is an avoided level crossing at intermediate momenta, where there is no clear distinction between the photon and the dipole
mode.

k and the longitudinal momentum

For the case of interacting photons, just as for non-interacting photons, a low-momentum description can be made where
the photons appear as non-relativistic, massive particles. Thus, when the photon frequency is separated from the resonance

with a small renormalization of the mass due to the interaction with the dipole ﬁeld. Note that the weak coupling condition (20)
is not essential for the non-relativistic description of the 2D photons, but is introduced to simplify the calculations. In physical
realizations of the 2D photon gas one may also have to consider the case of strong mixing of the photon and dipole degrees of
freedom, as discussed in the section on Rydberg atoms below.

The ﬁrst term of (25) can be interpreted as a delta function interaction between photons with the same helicity, the second be-
tween photons of opposite helicities. In the simplest case, with only one type of photon polarization (φa = φ), the corresponding
interaction Lagrangian simpliﬁes to

Thus, with the approximations used, we reach a form of the effective photon Lagrangian which agrees with the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation previously derived from the classical ﬁeld theory of a dimensionally reduced Maxwell ﬁeld interacting
with a non-linear medium [11]. The photons behave like 2D massive particles with a repulsive, pointlike interaction.

In the case of blue detuning, i.e., ∆ < 0, the situation is quite different. Typical dispersion curves are shown in Fig.1b, and
we see that now the ω+(k) branch is photon-like both for small and large momenta, and there is no avoided level crossing, but
only a level repulsion at small momenta.

However, also for blue detuning a low momentum effective action can be given where all the above formula, derived for red
detuning, still hold for scattering between the photons. But an important change is that the photons now are the “high energy”
particles relative to the dipoles, and it is energetically possible for them to “decay” into the low lying dipole modes. At tree
level (to ﬁrst order in the interaction) the dangerous process is γγ
γD which for blue detuning can conserve both energy and
momentum. The corresponding interaction piece in the Lagrangian can again be read from (16), but now with one of the ﬁelds
as ~E(−) (dipole ﬁeld) and the three others as ~E(+) (photon ﬁeld). In the low momentum approximation it is

→

where φ is the photon ﬁeld and ˜φ is the dipole ﬁeld.

An important quantity for assessing whether a gas of blue detuned photons can be maintained in the cavity, is the ratio
γγ induced by the

We shall return to numerical estimates of the physical parameters in section 7.

We conclude this section with some comments on Galilean invariance. The effective action, given by (8) and (9), is neither
Lorentz nor Galilean invariant, since the relativistic photons are coupled to dipoles deﬁned in a ﬁxed frame. Nevertheless the
effective theory deﬁned by (23) and (25) is Galilean invariant due to the low momentum approximations made in the vertices.
In the next section we will consider loop effects where the low momentum approximations are not any longer valid, and it is far
from obvious that the resulting corrections to the effective theory will respect the Galilean invariance. As we shall see, however,
the leading corrections do have this symmetry, so the interpretation of the photons as a nonrelativistic Bose system has validity
beyond the Born approximation.

4 RENORMALIZATION OF THE δ-FUNCTION INTERACTION.

In a many-particle interpretation the interaction Lagrangian (27) corresponds to a delta-function potential

V (r) =

δ(2)(~rij )

πg
m

i<j
X
where ~rij is the two-particle relative position. However, it is well known that a pure delta function interaction in dimensions
higher than one is not well deﬁned beyond ﬁrst order in perturbation theory. In two dimensions the second order term gives rise to
a logarithmic divergence in the scattering amplitude. To make the delta function interaction meaningful requires regularization
of the interaction and renormalization of the interaction strength. As discussed in ref.[12] the form of the s-wave scattering
amplitude for such a renormalized interaction is

where gr is the renormalized coupling constant and µr is a new parameter that is introduced by the renormalization (the renor-
malization scale). The corresponding phase shift for small gr is given by δ0 = πgr/4, which is the Born approximation value
π/ ln k2, that is common for a large class of
when g = gr. For small valus of k it approaches the universal expression, δ0 ≈
short range potentials [13].

Formally, the delta function interaction in two dimensions is dimensionless, i.e., it scales as the kinetic energy. However,
the renormalization breaks the scaling symmetry and introduces a length scale through the parameter µr. This is similar to the

situation in QCD, where the effect is referred to as dimensional transmutation [14]. One should note that the two parameters
gr and µr are not independent. Thus, gr may be ﬁxed as the bare parameter g and all the effect of the renormalization may be
absorbed in µr, or gr may be viewed as depending on µr, where µr is chosen to match the physical momentum interval. In the
latter case gr is referred to as an effective (or running) coupling constant. The explicit dependence on µr is given by

1
g −
with µ0 as a constant. From this expression we notice that for large momenta (large µr) the effective coupling constant goes to
zero, so this is a quantum mechanical analogue of the asymptotic freedom of QCD. Note also the curious fact that for sufﬁciently
large k the effective interaction is always attractive, irrespectively of the sign of the bare parameter g, whereas it in the other
limit is repulsive.

The above discussion refers to a situation where the φ4 theory is treated as a fundamental theory where gr and µr are free
parameters, to be determined by experiment. However, treated as a an effective (low energy) theory they are in principle
determined by the physical parameters of the complete system. For example, in the case of a quasi two-dimensional atomic Bose
gas in a highly asymmetric trap, the renormalization scale of the two-dimensional theory is essentially given by the extension of
the trap perpendicular to the plane in which the atoms move [15, 16].

In the present case the renormalized interaction strength may be determined by taking more explicitly into account the ef-
fect of the dipole degrees of freedom. This we do by using Schr¨odinger perturbation thery, with the interaction Hamiltonian
extracted from the the action (16), to calculate contributions to the scattering amplitude beyond the Born approximation. With
the expression for the scattering amplitude given by (32), which we assume to be correct for low momenta k, we note that the
renormalization scale µr can be determined from the contribution to second order in g (with gr = g). In such a second order
calculation of the scattering amplitude the contributions from the dipole mode cannot be neglected, since the intermediate states
are not restricted to low momenta. Thus, both the ﬁeld modes ~E(±) are included in the calculation, and the exact expressions for
the mode frequences ω±(k) are used rather than the low momentum approximations.

In the following we present a simple calculation of the leading contributions to the scattering amplitude. The result shows that
the form of the amplitude is as expected and it gives an estimate of the renormalization scale µr. In Appendix B we perform a
more complete calculation of some of the non-leading terms in the scattering amplitudes and give the corresponding expressions
for the scattering amplitude, for both red and blue detuning.

polarization vectors ~eα(~p1) and ~eβ(~p2). The quantum numbers n1 and n2 determine the longitudinal momenta of the particles
in the intermediate state.

In the low-momentum approximation the T-matrix element is independent of the sum of the transverse momenta, ~K = ~k1 +~k2,
i.e., it is Galilean invariant. This follows since ω(k1) and ω(k2) can be approximated by m in all places, except in the energy

Since we are interested in the behaviour of the scattering amplitude for small transverse momenta, in the ﬁrst order expression

we simply put them equal to zero. With all photons in the same helicity state, the ﬁrst order contribution is

in accordance with the expression for the low-energy Lagrangian (27). To second order there are three diagrams shown in ﬁg. 2.
Diagram 2a corresponds to two particles in the intermediate states, while diagrams 2b and 2c correspond to four and six particles
in the intermediate states. Thus, the contributions from diagrams 2b and 2c are suppressed by the energy denominator, since the
energy difference between the two initial and the four or six intermediate particles necessarily has to be large on the scale set by
the transverse momentum. For this reason we shall only consider contributions from diagram 2a. Note that there are two types
of particles in the intermediate state, characterized by energies ω− and ω+. As an important point also note that the transverse
momenta of the intermediate particle states cannot be assumed to be small, and also excitations to higher longitudinal momenta
have to be considered. We now discuss how to calculate the leading contributions to diagram 2a.

At low momenta, there is a potentially large contribution to diagram 2a, when the energy denominator vanishes, and as
ln k2 in (32). This term is dominant in the limit of

expected this will give rise to the logarithmically infrared divergent term
asymptotically small momenta where the approximations leading to (16) become exact.

∼

The importance of the high momentum contribution comes from the fact that ω− does not increase with momentum, but rather
approaches the resonance value ω0, c.f. Fig. 1. Thus, even if intermediate states with frequencies close to ω0 are considered
as highly excited relative to the low energy photons, the large number of dipoles may make contributions from these modes
important. In fact, if the dipoles are treated as a continuum, the integral over intermediate momenta will diverge. In reality we
know that there is a physical cutoff related to the discreteness of the system of dipoles. We introduce this simply as a cutoff in
momentum at a value corresponding to the (average) distance between the dipoles.

With a clear separation of the scales in the momentum integrals the leading contributions from high and low momenta can be

estimated separately. In order to see how this works we examine the following toy problem. Consider the integral

where the low and high momentum contributions are treated separately. This expression reproduces the exact result up to
O(m2/Λ2). Below we will examine the leading contributions to the second order scattering amplitude in this way, by evaluating
separately the contributions from low and high momenta. In this calculation the detuning parameter and the photon mass will
play the role of ∆ and m in the toy problem. We refer to Appendix B for a more complete treatment.

For large momenta the important contribution comes from the term with two dipole excitations in the intermediate state. For
0 and the momentum integral is divergent without the cutoff. The only effect of the

these excitations we have have ω(p)2

We can neglect contributions from the transverse momenta of the scattered (external) photons, since these are smaller by

the importance of renormalization of the nonlinear effects for intermediate momenta, i.e., for g ln k2∆2

α.

In order to obtain the ﬁnite result (48) we have introduced a cutoff, pmax = π/losc, in the momentum integration, where
3 is the distance between the oscillators, and a cutoff in the discrete longitudinal momentum variable at N = L/losc =

losc = ρ− 1
Lπpmax. This means that we have (pmax/π)3 = ρ, with ρ as the 3D oscillator density.

The low-momentum contribution

The important low momentum contribution comes from the term with two photons in the intermediate state. The energy
denominator then vanishes when the momenta of the intermediate photons match the ones of the external photons. Since
all photons then are low momentum photons, for the leading contribution we can replace ω(p) by the low energy expression
m + p2/2m (and ω(k) by m + k2/2m) to get the energy denominator on the form

Here p1 and p2 are the transverse photon momenta of the intermediate state. In this case only the lowest longitudinal mode has
to be included in the intermediate state. In the same way as for high momenta there are corrections, but they are supressed by
factors η2/m2 or ∆2/m2, and we shall neglect them.

We note that an integration of the intermediate state momentum of this term alone gives rise to a logarithmic ultraviolet
divergence. Eventually this divergence is of course cut off by the interparticle distance, but before that the integrand is suppressed

There is also a term corresponding to one photon and one dipole in the intermediate state, but the real part of this is subleading

and we note that in this limit the effective interaction is independent both of momentum and of the anharmonicity parameter Λ
of the oscillator spectrum. The detuning parameter ∆ (and not the anharmonicity parameter Λ) now determines the sign of the
effective coupling, with repulsive interaction for red detuning and attractive interaction for blue detuning.

Comparison with the Kerr nonlinear susceptibility coefﬁcient χ(3) for two-level atoms

Since the renormalization parameter α is proportional to 1/∆, it easily gets large for small detuning, ∆ << ω0, as shown
explicitly for the case of photons interacting with Rydberg atoms, in the section below. The renormalized coupling constant gr
(which then is much smaller than the bare coupling constant g) should then be interpreted as the physical interaction parameter.
One should, however, note that the expression we have found for gr is not based on a systematic expansion in Λ, but rather
by resumming “dangerous” terms in the expansion. There will be other contributions to the renormalized coupling, but these
are parametrically small, i.e., supressed by powers of small ratios like η/m or ∆/m. Without resumming other parts of the
perturbation series, we cannot determine in which parameter range these terms can be neglected. For the following estimates we
shall simply assume that we are in that range.

The interpretation of gr as the physical interaction parameter is reinforced by the fact that the expression we have found (58),
depends on the detuning parameter ∆, the effective plasma frequency η, and the atomic number density ρ in exactly the same
way as the non-linear Kerr susceptibility coefﬁcient χ(3)
G for a dilute gas of two-level atoms, as obtained by Grischkowsky [17],

with µe as the dipole matrix element (for one component of the dipole vector) connecting the two states of the two-level atom.

6 SCALES, BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION AND TWO PHOTON BOUND STATES

Based on the discussion of the effective photon-photon interaction in the previous sections, we will now consider some of
the physical aspects of the formation of a two-dimensional photon ﬂuid. We ﬁrst summarize the important parameters that
characterize the photon system, and then discuss the conditions under which two particularly interesting phenomena could
occur: the formation of a two dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, and the formation of two-photon bound states. We should
stress that both these effects are essentially quantum mechanical, and cannot be described by classical non-linear optics.

The strength of the mixing between the photons and the oscillators is given by the effective plasma frequency η deﬁned by

and mixing becomes important when η2

Photonic Bose-Einstein condensates

As mentioned in the introduction, one of the most exciting aspects of forming a photon gas, would be the possibility to study
phase transitions. First, recall that there is no Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a free two dimensional gas. However, the
√N ¯hΩ [18],
situation is different when the gas is in a trapping potential, where the transition temperature is given by kBTc ≈
where N is the total number of bosons and Ω is the frequency of the (harmonic) trapping potential. In an interacting gas the

14

(69)

situation is more complicated. The Mermin-Wagner theorem [19] rules out true long-range order, but there is still the possibility
ρ2D¯h2/m,
of a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition, with the formation of a “quasicondensate” at a critical temperature kBTc ≈
with ρ2D the 2D boson density and m the boson mass. In the context of two-dimensional atomic BEC, the phase transition in
a quasi two dimensional Bose gas with repulsive delta function interactions was recently analyzed by Petrov, Holzmann and
Shlyapnikov [15]. They ﬁnd that in a trapping potential a true condensate will form well below Tc, whereas for intermediate
temperatures T < Tc it will change to a quasicondensate with a spatially ﬂuctuating phase.

For a two-dimensional (dilute) photon gas a similar analysis should be relevant. We will make some comments on this in
the discussion of a photon gas interacting with Rydberg atoms in the next section. For this discussion the expressions for
the effective interaction parameter, (67) and the two-dimensional cross-section (29) are important. There are also important
questions concerning the thermalization time and the possibility of regulating the effective temperature of the photon gas. With
the parameter values discussed below the critical temperature is typically very much higher than the excitation energies. This
indicates that a thermalized photon ﬂuid would tend to form a Bose condensate rather than a normal ﬂuid, and that the phase
transition temperature cannot easily be reached by varying the parameter values of the photon ﬂuid.

The scattering amplitude (32) always has a pole for complex k on the second Riemann sheet, at k2 =

2mEb. This corre-

sponds to a bound state, a “diphoton state” [20], with binding energy Eb given by

Somewhat surprisingly it looks like one could have a bound state for either sign of gr, and this is indeed the case for a fundamental
delta function interaction [12]. We note, however, that for repulsive interactions (gr > 0), the bound state would occur at large

where the photons are stable against decay to the lower energy dipole mode. However, when α >> 1, which seems most relevant
for physical realizations (se discussion below), weakly bound photon pairs would occur only for blue detuning. In this case we
do not expect the formation of stable bound pairs due to the presence of the decay channel to the dipole mode.

7 THE 2D PHOTON FLUID: PHYSICAL REALIZATIONS

In this section we shall discuss two possible experimental scenarios for the formation of a 2D photon ﬂuid. First, we consider
microwave photons in a cavity ﬁlled with Rydberg atoms. This scenario is quite close to the one described in the previous
sections, since the highly excited atoms are well described as harmonic oscillators with a small anharmonicity. As a second
example we shall consider optical photons in a cavity ﬁlled with alkali atoms in their ground states.

The question we shall address is the following: Can the parameters of these systems be tuned in such a way that there
results a sufﬁciently large effective photon-photon interaction—mediated by virtual transitions within the atoms—so that a two-
dimensional photon ﬂuid can form within a Fabry-Perot resonator? One might expect that such a ﬂuid arises after many effective
photon-photon collisions within the cavity. Based on the analysis of the previous sections we reach an answer to this question
which is qualiﬁed afﬁrmative. The conditions for a photon ﬂuid in thermal equilibrium to form may be met, but only under
conditions where the parameters can be tuned to optimal values. For the Rydberg atoms these conditions seem more difﬁcult to
satisfy than for the optical photons.

However, the conclusions concerning the formation of a photon ﬂuid are based on simple order of magnitude estimates of the
physical parameters. One should note that the expressions used in these estimates were found above assuming certain conditions
(separation of physical scales) which are not necessarily met in the real system. Also the expression found for the interaction
parameter gr is based on the resummation of certain large contributions, while other higher order contributions are left out. For
this reason we can present only a preliminary evaluation of the conditions for a 2D photon ﬂuid to form. A detailed evaluation
of these conditions is outside the scope of the present paper.

Rydberg atoms in a microwave Fabry-Perot cavity: Numerical estimates

We ﬁrst consider the case where microwave photons interact via Rydberg atoms excited near resonance, with both photons
and atoms injected into a microwave version of a Fabry-Perot cavity. Consider a ribbon-shaped beam of Rydberg atoms passing
λ0/2. The plates are partially
through the gap between a pair of parallel, conducting plates, separated by a spacing LL ≈
transparent to microwaves, for example, by having a regular square array of small holes, and can thus act as the (highly reﬂective)
mirrors of a microwave Fabry-Perot cavity. Microwave photons can be injected into the cavity from the outside, and their
transverse distribution, after many photon-photon interactions mediated by the atoms, can be monitored in transmission. The
resonance frequency of the cavity can be tuned to near a resonance frequency of the Rydberg atoms.

For simplicity, let the plates be square in shape, with a typical transverse dimension of LT >> λ0, where λ0 is the microwave
resonance wavelength of the Rydberg atom transition of interest. The longitudinal mode number of the cavity is restricted to that
L = λ0/2 between the plates), but there can
of the fundamental longitudinal mode of the cavity (by our choice of spacing LL ≡
exist many possible transverse modes of the cavity, which are closely spaced near the fundamental longitudinal mode.

For concreteness, we shall use as a guide the parameters of the experiment of the Paris group [21], where Rubidium atoms
were excited to n = 50, where n is the principal quantum number of the Rydberg atom. The Rydberg atoms can be put into the
“circular” state
, which have a maximal electric dipole moment, and thus a maximal coupling to the
i
microwave photons. Since the typical size of such a Rydberg atom is given by the radii of the circular Bohr orbits an = n2a0,
0.5 ˚A is the Bohr radius, the atom can be quite large in size, e.g., an=50 ≈
0.125 microns. The electric dipole
where a0 ≈
n = 51 transition is also quite large, and therefore the photon-photon coupling
transition matrix element for the n = 50

mediated by such atoms virtually excited near resonance should be correspondingly large.
In the regime of high n, the energy levels of Rydberg atoms are almost equally spaced,

with κ = 1/na0. This system is very well suited to be modeled by an anharmonic oscillator model of the type discussed earlier.
We shall determine the anharmonic parameter Λ, the oscillator frequency ω, and the oscillator mass M of this model in terms of
the Rydberg atom parameters, by matching the both the energy spectra to terms quadratic in n and the dipole matrix elements
between the levels n and n + 1.

One might object to this procedure since in our previous calculations we assumed the oscillators to be in their ground state
rather than in a highly excited state. In particular this means that the effect of virtual transitions to lower Rydberg states that
would be present in Rydberg atoms with the spectrum(70) are not taken into account. However, it should be kept in mind that
the detuning for transitions of Rydberg atoms to lower states will be substantially larger than those to the higher states. In any
case, for the simple numerical estimates made in this section we shall ignore this effect, and assume that only upward transitions
n + 1 are important. This approximation will at most give rise to a numerical factor of order of unity in the estimate of
n
the model parameters. For the same reason we shall neglect the fact that the oscillators of our model are three-dimensional and
simply match the dipole matrix elements of the Rydberg states with those of the corresponding one-dimensional anharmonic
oscillator.

With the above matching procedure for “circular” Rydberg atoms prepared in a state with the initial principal quantum number

However, this expression gives for the magnitude of the renormalization constant,
ω0/(n∆), and α therefore becomes very
large, since we shall operate the system with very small detunings near resonance, so that ∆ << ω0. The detuning ∆, however,
must be much larger than the natural line width of the atoms [22], and in this limit we can use the Λ independent expression
(67) for the renormalized coupling constant. Note that in this limit the sign of the physical interaction is determined solely by
the detuning parameter ∆ - repulsive for red detunings ∆ > 0, attractive for blue detunings, ∆ < 0. Matching the dipole matrix

can interact via the Rydberg atoms. Higher modes will be available and they will also interact via the atoms, but the energy-
momentum relation for these higher modes will be modiﬁed relative to the non-relativistic expression. However, even with the
limited number of modes available one should in principle be able to see the formation of a photon ﬂuid in a Bose condensed
state.

inversely as the square of the quality factor, i.e., Iout ∼
Based on the above, we estimate that about 1.1 microwatts of incident microwave power is needed in order to get around ten

photon ﬂuid should form inside the cavity.

Chemical potential and speed of sound of the photon ﬂuid

From the previous section it might seem that it is always possible to form a photon ﬂuid just by increasing the intensity of the
incident microwaves. This conclusion is however not justiﬁed, since a too high intensity will make the ﬂuid so dense, and the
mean kinetic energy is so large, that the non-relativistic approximations are no longer valid. To get a rough estimate of when
this happens, we use an effective Ginzburg-Landau (GL) type theory that should be applicable when the ﬂuid is very dense. The
relevant potential is given by

where we introduced a chemical potential which, in the Thomas-Fermi approximation, is related to the photon density by the
relation

which is obtained by minimizing V with respect to
ﬂuid with a speed given by [5],

Alkali atoms in an optical Fabry-Perot cavity

The apparent advantages of using microwaves and Rydberg atoms, rather than a more standard setup with lasers and e.g.
Rubidium atoms, is twofold. First the cavity dimensions are not too small, and second, the large dipole moment of the atoms
implies a large nonlinearity. The obvious disadvantage is that the Rydberg atoms are much harder to create and manipulate.
Also since we have shown that the anharmonic parameter Λ drops out of the renormalized coupling constant gr for small ∆, it
is of interest to consider an optical Fabry-Perot cavity with alkali atoms in their ground states, for which there is only a single
transition to one excited state with a very strong oscillator strength of the order of unity, which almost completely exhausts the
f -oscillator sum rule. For alkali atoms, a two-level model for the atom is therefore a more appropriate one [17]. However,
the renormalized coupling constant for photon-photon interactions, and the resulting rates for collisions found in the previous
section, should still apply here, provided that we remember to use the condition that the detuning ∆ be comparable to the
effective plasma frequency η for the expressions for collision rates.

One consequence of going from microwave to visible wavelengths, is that the number of nonrelativistic transverse modes

modes which can be coupled together. Also the estimated KT transition temperature is relatively lower, with kBTc ≈

High-Q microspheres of glass and the formation of a 2D photon ﬂuid

≃

Let us ﬁnally comment on a third possible way in which a 2D photon ﬂuid could form. Extremely high-Q optical cavities with
1010 have been fabricated out of low-loss, small-diameter glass microspheres [25]. A 120-µm diameter glass microsphere
Q
immersed in superﬂuid helium has been observed to exhibit a nonlinear, dispersive bistable behavior with a threshold power
of as low as 10 microwatts, due to the intrinsic Kerr nonlinearity of the glass which constitutes the microsphere [26]. Due
to the curvature of the microspheres the photons are tightly conﬁned to propagate within an optical wavelength or so of the
two-dimensional spherical surface, i.e., within its “whispering-gallery” modes. This tight, two-dimensional conﬁnement of the
light should also allow an effective dimensional reduction from 3D to 2D in the photon degrees of freedom, which differs from
the mechanism of dimensional reduction in a planar Fabry-Perot cavity discussed here in this paper. Thus a two-dimensional
photon ﬂuid could also in principle form just within the inside surface of the microsphere, due to the photon-photon scatterings
mediated by the intrinsic Kerr nonlinearity of the glass, and may have already been indirectly observed in the experiments of
[26]. It should be noted that the change of topology from that of a plane to that of a sphere should not make the formation of the
2D photon ﬂuid impossible in principle.

8 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we used a microscopic approach to study the effective interaction between photons conﬁned to a quasi-two-
dimensional cavity ﬁlled with a non-linear medium. With the atoms modelled by a collection of non-linear Lorentz oscillators,
the interaction was studied to second order in perturbation theory. The linear problem was ﬁrst solved by decoupling the
“polariton modes”, and we described efﬁcient ways to do this, both by use of a path integral approach and by use of exact
diagonalization, as shown in Appendix A. A main motivation was to examine the description of the effective interaction, induced
by the non-linearity, as a 2D short range (delta function) interaction and to determine the renormalization scale associated with

19

this interaction. We noticed several interesting complications. For red detuning relative to the oscillator frequency, the expression
found to second order ﬁts with the form of a normalized delta-function potential. However, the renormalization parameter is
typically large and a resummation of “dangerous” terms has been performed in order to extract an effective, renormalized
interaction strength. This way of including higher order contributions raises questions of whether other contributions, not
included here (since they are parametrically small), may also be of importance. However, additional support for the expression
found for the renormalized interaction parameter comes from other evaluations of the non-linear susceptibility of a gas of alkali
atoms. For blue detuning, we discussed the possible formation of photonic bound states, and noticed the possibility that photons
might “decay” into oscillator excitations.

The last part of the paper was devoted to a discussion of possible experimental scenarios, where a photon ﬂuid may form
in a Fabry-Perot resonator. In these cases, two-dimensionality is obtained by constraining the photons in one direction to their
fundamental mode. By means of order of magnitude estimates we examined the constraints on the physical parameters in order
for a photon ﬂuid to form. There is a potential conﬂict between the need to have a high density of photons in order to obtain a
satisfactory collision frequency and the possibility of having a too high density measured in units of the photon Compton wave
length, since the effective photon mass is typically very small. For photons in a microwave cavity interacting with Rydberg
atoms the corresponding constraints are serious, although by choosing optimal parameter values the conditions for creating a 2D
photon ﬂuid can probably be met. Such an experimental realization is otherwise attractive, as the model of photons interacting
with Rydberg atoms is closely related to the oscillator model used in the paper. For photons in an optical cavity, the constraints
on the physical parameters seem less severe, although the use of such small scale cavities may pose a larger experimental
challenge. We noticed that in both cases the typical temperature associated with a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition lies well
above the energy scale associated with non-relativistic 2D photons, and for such low energies a condensate will typically form
if the collision frequency is sufﬁciently large on the scale set by the ringdown time of the cavity. In addition to the two possible
experimental realizations discussed in some detail, we also suggest that other types of realizations of the 2D photon ﬂuid may be
possible, and in particular we pointed at the use of high-Q microspheres of glass as being potentially interesting in this context.
Let us ﬁnally stress the point that in this study we have made some simplifying assumptions, in particular about a clear
separation of the physical (energy) scales associated with the formation of a 2D photon ﬂuid. In real systems, these conditions
may not be well satisﬁed, and in the discussion of microwave photons interacting with Rydberg atoms we noticed that one may
have to tune the frequency so close to the resonance value that the photons become strongly mixed with the oscillator degrees
of freedom, i.e., they are genuine polaritons rather than photons. For this reason we consider the order of magnitude estimates
applied to these realizations only as preliminary ones. A more detailed study is needed to settle more ﬁrmly the conditions for
the creation of 2D photon ﬂuids in such small Fabry-Perot cavities.

APPENDIX A . ALTERNATIVE DERIVATION OF THE EFFECTIVE PHOTON ACTION

In this Appendix we derive the effective action (14) and (16) by an alternative method which does not require any ﬁeld
transformation of the type (13) which is non local in time. In addition to verifying the soundness of the simple procedure used
in the text, the present derivation explicitly shows that the effective action is the sum of the two contributions in (14) and (16)
corresponding to the two frequencies ω±.

The most natural object to consider given the action (1), would be the generating functional Z[ ~J ~A, ~J ~R], which can be written
as a Feynman path integral over the ﬁelds ~A and ~R. By a change of variables one can diagonalize the quadratic part of the
action, and then use perturbation theory to calculate Greens functions. However, becuause of the time derivative coupling (4),
this will give rise to expressions which are nonlocal in time, since this procedure fails to correctly describe the normal modes.
An obvious way to proceed is to switch to a Hamiltonian formalism, do an explicit diagonalization of the quadratic piece of the
Hamiltonian by a symplectic transformation on the phase space, and ﬁnally express the nonlinear term in the new variables. This
method is however cumbersome, and we now present a simpler approach based on the path integral.

The essential step is to use an alternative form of the action which is related to (1) by a Legendre transformation. Rather
than just writing down this transformation, we shall go back to the derivation of the Feynman path integral, since this will

illuminate the physical meaning of the new variables. The usual Hamiltonian description of (1) would comprise two canonical
˙~R + q ~A. Since we are dealing with a coupled system of matter and radiation, it is
pairs ( ~A,

APPENDIX B. SCATTERING AMPLITUDE TO SECOND ORDER

We perform here a more detailed evaluation of the second order contributions to the scattering amplitude. The contributions
from low and high momenta of the intermediate states are examined, and we consider in both cases only the leading contributions
in terms of the small quantities k/m, ∆/m, and η/∆. The contributions come from diagram a) in Fig.2, with the intermediate
lines corresponding to either the photon or the dipole mode, with transverse momenta running from zero to the cutoff 1/losc,
where losc is the physical distance between the oscillators. There is also a sum over all longitudinal momenta, in terms of the
discrete momentum variable n, and a sum over the polarization vectors of the ﬁelds.

with C = K/(4(2π)4m∆2). Here the reference frame is chosen where the total transverse momentum vanishes. The energy of
both incoming and scattered photons is ω−(k, 1), with the photons in the lowest longitudinal mode (and where red detuning has
been assumed). Since these are low momentum photons, we have ω−(k, 1)

m + k2/m.

A simpliﬁcation may be introduced by considering the effect of mixing between photons and dipoles, described through the
parameter η. This mixing affects the expression in two ways. The ﬁrst one is through the η dependent term that is explicit in
(108). This term is important when the particle energies are close to the resonance value ω0. The other one is the indirect one
which enters through the particle energy ω±. When summing over both the photon and dipole modes in the intermediate state
this η dependence is less important. It only affects the lowest longitudinal mode and only for transverse momenta in a small
∆. We will neglect this effect, which can be viewed as higher order in η2 and use the energy expressions for the
interval p
uncoupled modes,

q
ω+ = ω0

Two-dipole intermediate states

(Note, with this redeﬁnition ω− is the photon mode also when higher in energy than the dipole mode.) We consider now
separately contributions from the different modes in the intermediate states.

Since ω+ is independent of p there is no suppression of the integrand for high momenta and the integral over p and sum over n
are divergent without the momentum cutoff. This cutoff we set to pmax for the transverse momentum and N = pmaxL/π for the
osc = (pmax/π)3. Since we assume L >> losc
longitudinal momentum. The connection with the oscillator density is ρ = 1/l3
most of the contribution comes from large transverse and longitudinal momenta where the dimensional reduction no longer is
effective . We note that the only momentum dependence now sits in the polarization factor, which we approximate by

is correct when we (for large momenta) can treat the longitudinal momentum as a continuous variable.

With these approximations the momentum sum and integral can trivially be performed, and the contribution is

We note that the sign of this k-independent contribution depends on the sign of ∆, the detuning parameter.

We now consider the terms where one of the intermediate modes is a photon mode and the other a dipole mode. The mo-
mentum integral is convergent, with the main contribution coming from low momenta. For p << nm we approximate the
polarization factors by 1, and

is simpliﬁed to

One should note the difference between red detuning (∆ > 0) and blue detuning (∆ < 0). In the latter case the integration path
passes a pole which gives rise to an imaginary part. That is not the case for red detuning.

With two photons in the intermediate state the main contribution comes from the term n1 = n2 = 1 which has a pole at

We note that whereas the expression for red detuning agrees with the expected form for a renormalized delta function interaction,
the expression for blue detuning contains an additional imaginary part. This is small compared with the constant real part, but
has nevertheless some signiﬁcance. As noted above it arises from the pole in the energy factor in the case where one photon and
one dipole is present in the intermediate state. It is therefore related to the possibility of real scattering of the two photons into a
photon and a dipole excitation, as discussed in the text.

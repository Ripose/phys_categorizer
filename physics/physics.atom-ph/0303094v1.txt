We report quantum Monte Carlo calculations of superﬂuid Fermi gases with short-range two-body
attractive interactions with inﬁnite scattering length. The energy of such gases is estimated to be
(0.44
0.01) times that of the noninteracting gas, and their pairing gap is approximately twice the
energy per particle. PACS: 03.75.Fi, 05.30.Fk, 21.65.+F

In dilute Fermi gases the pair interactions have a range
much smaller than the interparticle spacing. However,
when the two-particle scattering length is large, these
short range interactions can modify the gas properties
signiﬁcantly. A well known example is low density neu-
tron matter which may occur in the inner crust of neu-
tron stars [1]. The two-neutron interaction has a range
of ∼ 2 fm, but the scattering length is large, −18 fm,
so that even at densities as small as one percent of the
nuclear density the parameter akF has magnitude much
larger than one. Bertsch proposed in 1998 that solution
of the idealized problem of a dilute Fermi gas in the limit
akF → −∞ could give useful insights into the properties
of low density neutron gas.

Cold dilute gases of 6Li atoms have been produced in
atom traps. The interaction between these atoms can
be tuned using a known Feshbach resonance; and the
estimated value of akF in the recent experiment [2] is
∼ −7.4. As the interaction strength is increased beyond
that for a = −∞, we get bosonic two-fermion bound
states. In this sense a dilute Fermi gas with large a is in
between weak coupling BCS superﬂuid and dilute Bose
gases with Bose-Einstein condensation [3]. Attempts to
produce Bose gases in the limit, a/r0 → ∞ using Fesh-
bach resonances [4, 5], are in progress, and their energy
has been recently estimated using variational methods
[6].

In the a → −∞ limit k2

F /m is the only energy scale,
and the ground state energy of the interacting dilute
Fermi gas is proportional to the noninteracting Fermi gas
energy:

E0(ρ) = ξ EF G = ξ

Baker [7] and Heiselberg [8] have attempted to obtain the
value of the constant ξ from expansions of the Fermi gas
energy in powers of akF . Heiselberg obtained ξ = 0.326,
while Baker’s values are ξ = 0.326 and 0.568.

Fermi gases with attractive pair interaction become su-
perﬂuid at low temperature. The BCS expressions in
terms of the scattering length were given by Leggett [9],
and they were used to study the properties of superﬂuid
dilute Fermi gases, as a function of akF , by Engelbrecht,
Randeria and S´a de Melo [10]. For akF = −∞ they

obtain an upperbound, ξ = 0.59, using the BCS wave
function. These gases are also estimated to have large
gaps comparable to the ground state energy per particle.
Here we report studies of Fermi gases with quantum

Monte Carlo methods using the model potential:

v(r) = −

µ2
cosh2(µr)

.

(2)

The zero energy solution of the two-body Schr¨odinger
equation with this potential is tanh(µr)/r and corre-
sponds to a = −∞. The eﬀective range is 2/µ, and in
order to ensure that the gas is dilute we use µr0 > 10,
where r0 is the unit radius; ρr3
0 = 3/4π. All the results
presented here are for µr0 = 12; however some of the
calculations were repeated for µr0 = 24 and the results
extrapolated to 1/µ → 0.

We have carried out ﬁxed node Green’s function Monte
Carlo [11] (FN-GFMC) calculations with trial wave func-
tions of the form:

ΨV (R) =

f (rij′ )Φ(R) ,

(3)

Yi,j′

where i, j, ... and i′, j′, ... label spin up and down parti-
cles, and the conﬁguration vector R gives the positions of
all the particles. Only the antiparallel spin pairs are cor-
related in this ΨV with the Jastrow function f (rij′ ). The
parallel spin pairs do not feel the short range interaction
due to Pauli exclusion.

In FN-GFMC the ΨV is evolved in imaginary time with
the operator e−Hτ while keeping its nodes ﬁxed to avoid
the fermion sign problem. In the limit τ → ∞ it yields
the lowest energy state with the nodes of ΨV . These
nodes, and hence the FN-GFMC energies, do not depend
upon the positive deﬁnite Jastrow function. Nevertheless
it is useful to reduce the variance of the FN-GFMC calcu-
lation. In the present work we use approximate solutions
of the two-body Schr¨odinger equation:

f (r < d) = λf (r < d) ,

with the boundary conditions f (r > d) = 1 and f ′(r =
d) = 0 [6]. The value of d is obtained by minimizing the
energy calculated using variational Monte Carlo. Note

that a dilute Fermi gas is stable even when a → −∞,
unlike dilute Bose gases in the a → ∞ limit.

The calculations are carried out in a periodic cubic box
having ρL3 = N . The single particle states in this box
are plane waves with momenta ki:

in Eq. 3. The more general, Jastrow-BCS ΨV (R) has:

ΦBCS = A[φ(r11′ )φ(r22′ )...φ(rnn′ )] ,

(7)

with n = N/2. The antisymmetrizer A in the ΦBCS sep-
arately antisymmetrizes between the spin up and down
particles. The ΦBCS describes the component of the BCS
state with N particles when

The nodal surfaces of ΦBCS depend upon the pairing
function φ(r), and equal those of ΦS when vi = 0 for all
ki > kF .

FN-GFMC gives upperbounds to the energy, which
equal the exact value when the trial wave function has
the nodal structure of the ground state. Therefore, we
can determine the φ(r) variationally by minimizing the
FN-GFMC energy. We use the parameterization:

φ(r) = ˜β(r) +

αI exp[iki · r] ,

˜β(r) = β(r) + β(L − r) − 2β(L/2) ,

β(r) = [1 + γbr] [1 − exp[−cbr]]

(12)

exp[−br]

The function ˜β(r) has a range of L/2, the value of γ
is chosen such that it has zero slope at the origin, and
IC = 4 here.

The parameters b, c and αI≤IC of φ(r) are optimized
by choosing a random distribution of initial values and
measuring the parameters of the lowest-energy (longest-
lasting) conﬁgurations in FN-GFMC calculation. For 38
particles it produces an optimum set of parameters br0 =
0.8, c = 10, αI=0,4 = 0.016, 0.466, 0.0068, 0.00091, 0.0007
which give the smallest FN-GFMC energy having ξ =
0.440(2). Calculations in which β(r) = 0 give opti-
mum values αI=0,4 = 0.24, 1.0, 0.2, 0.057, 0.035 and ξ =

0.459(2), while the Slater φS(r) having β(r) = 0 and
αI=0,4 = 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 gives a much larger ξ = 0.54.

The optimum φ(r) is compared with the φS(r) in Fig.
1; it has a sharper peak at r = 0. This peak depends upon
the Jastrow function f (r) acting between all the N 2/4
antiparallel spin pairs. For example, the φ(r) obtained
by solving the BCS equation with the bare potential in
uniform gas without the f (r) has a much sharper peak.
The optimum φ(r) has α0 < α1 for N = 38; in contrast
the variationally determined BCS wave function has α0 ≥
α1. The momentum distribution of particles in the trial
and evolved (τ = 0 and ∞) wave functions are shown in
Figure 2. For N = 14 and 38 the occupation of the I = 0
state is smaller than the I = 1, calculations with much
larger values of N are planned to test if this is a ﬁnite
box size eﬀect.

We have attempted further optimizations by incorpo-

rating backﬂow [12, 13] into the BCS pair functions ˜φ.
Initial calculations indicate that this will reduce the ξ by
≈ 0.02. On the other hand, estimates of the corrections
due to the ﬁnite range of the present interaction indicate
that going to the 1/µ → 0 limit will raise ξ by a similar
amount. Thus our present upperbound for the constant

ξ is 0.44(1).

In order to estimate the gap ∆ of this superﬂuid we
studied diﬀerences between energies of systems with odd
and even number of particles. A general wave function
with n pairs, u spin up and d spin down unpaired parti-
cles can be written as:

ΦBCS(R) = A

[φ(r11′ )...φ(rnn′ )] [ψ1↑(rn+1)...ψu↑(rn+u)]
(cid:8)

(cid:2)

ψ1↓(r(n+1)′ )...ψd↓(r(n+d)′)

.

(13)

(cid:3)(cid:9)

The unpaired particles are in ψi↑ and ψj↓ single particle states. We can write this wave function as the determinant
of an M × M matrix where M = n + u + d [14]. For example, when u = 2 and d = 3 the matrix is given by:

φ(r11′ )
φ(r21′ )
...

φ(r12′ )
φ(r22′ )
...

...

... ψ1↓(r(n+d)′ )

The fact that the general ΦBCS(R) can be expressed as
a determinant makes it possible to perform numerical
calculations for large values of N . When N = 2n, the
fully paired ground state has u = d = 0, while those of
systems with N = 2n + 1 have either u or d = 1.

The FN-GFMC ground state energies for various val-
ues of N are shown in ﬁgure 3. The straight dotted line
in Fig. 3 is 0.44EF G. The calculated energies have the
odd-even gap expected in superﬂuids, and well known in
nuclei. The values of the odd-even gap:

∆(N = 2n+1) = E(N )−

(E(N −1)+E(N +1)) , (15)

1
2

are shown in Fig. 4. The estimated value of the gap is
∼ 0.9EF G or ∼ 2ξEF G. In fact the odd particle removal
energies, E(N = 2n + 1) − E(N = 2n), at ﬁxed density,
are ∼ (4/3)EF G. The odd particles in the interacting gas
have energies higher than that for noninteracting. Ap-
parently the odd particles do not gain any beneﬁt from
the attractive pair potential, on the other hand they hin-
der the pairing of the others. BCS calculations including
polarization correction [15, 16] give ∆ = 0.81EF G in the
large a limit.

Several consequences of the strong pairing in this su-
perﬂuid gas are seen in the calculated energies. Nonin-
teracting Fermi gases have shell gaps at N = 14 and 38;
they are not noticeable in this gas. The ground states
of 15 and 17 particle systems have momenta with I = 1
rather than the I = 2 in noninteracting states and the
I = 0 expected in the limit of strongly-bound pairs.

Some of the diﬀerences between the nodal structures

FIG. 3: The E(N ) in units of EF G

of the JS and J-BCS wave functions can be seen by con-
sidering the case where ri = ri′ . For the JS case, the
up and down determinants will then be identical and
the complete wave function will be the square of one of
these determinants. We now imagine exchanging the po-
sitions of two pairs by rotating them around their center
of mass. Since each determinant must change sign, the JS
wave function must go through zero during this exchange.
When the pairs are separated by small distances the up
and down determinants are no longer equal. Thus they
will change signs at diﬀerent points along the exchange
path. We therefore expect a negative region which will
eﬀectively block these “two-boson” exchanges for ﬁxed

node calculations. In the J-BCS case, the exchanges can
occur without crossing a node. In the composite boson
limit where φ(r) is strongly peaked around the origin,
there is no sign change under pair exchanges when all
the pairs are well separated.

In order to further understand the diﬀerence between
the JS and J-BCS wave functions we studied their nodal
structure for the following three-pair exchange. In ran-
J−BCS(R)
domly chosen conﬁgurations distributed with Ψ2
the three closest pairs ii′, jj′ and kk′ were identiﬁed.
Their center of masses are denoted by Sl. The wave
functions Ψ′(x) are calculated for the positions deﬁned as
follows: All particles m, m′ 6= i, i′, j, j′, k, k′ retain their
positions in the random conﬁguration. The positions of
i, j, k are given by:

ri = Si + s + x(Sj − Si) ,

(16)

and cyclic permutations of it. Here s is the relative dis-
tance between particles in a pair. Those of i′, j′, k′ have
−s in place of s, and the typical value, |s| = 0.25r0 is
used in these studies. The three pairs complete a circu-
lar exchange ii′ → jj′ → kk′, in the x = 0 to 1 interval.
We calculate the ratio Ψ′(x)/Ψ′(x = 0) for many conﬁg-
urations. Note that Ψ′(1)/Ψ′(0) = 1. In a ﬁxed node cal-
culation the space where this ratio is negative is blocked
for the diﬀusion of the conﬁguration. For JS and J-BCS
wave functions the ratios are negative, on average, over
29 and 17 % of the x = 0 to 1 domain. For about half
of the conﬁgurations the J-BCS had positive ratio for all
values of x, while only 20 % of the JS conﬁgurations have
this property.

We therefore picture the change in the nodal struc-
ture in going from the JS to the J-BCS wave functions

4

as an opening up of the conﬁguration space to allow
pairs to exchange without crossing a node. For systems
with a paired ground state, the J-BCS presumably allows
oﬀ diagonal long range order via these pair exchanges.
In most cases the energy diﬀerence between the normal
state evolved from the JS wave function and the super-
ﬂuid state evolved from J-BCS is very small (< 0.1%),
and calculations of the type presented here are diﬃcult.
However, in dilute Fermi gases with large negative a this
diﬀerence is ∼ 20 % and calculations of the superﬂuid
are possible with bare forces.

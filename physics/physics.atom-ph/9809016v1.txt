Abstract

We have observed the cold collision frequency shift of the 1S-2S transition
in trapped spin-polarized atomic hydrogen. We ﬁnd ∆ν1S−2S = −3.8 ± 0.8 ×
10−10 n Hz cm3, where n is the sample density. From this we derive the 1S-
2S s-wave triplet scattering length, a1S−2S = −2.9 ± 0.6 nm, which is in good
agreement with a recent calculation. The shift provides a valuable probe of
the distribution of densities in a trapped sample.

Methods for cooling and trapping neutral atoms have opened a low energy regime where
collisional phenomena involve only a single partial wave. The ground state s-wave scattering
lengths for many of the alkali metal atoms have been obtained from combinations of theory
and experiment. Those studies were motivated in part by the need to estimate evaporative
cooling rates [1], study the stability of Bose-Einstein condensates [2,3], and understand
collisional shifts of atomic fountain frequency standards [4,5].

We have measured a density-dependent frequency shift of the two-photon 1S-2S tran-
sition in trapped atomic hydrogen. This allows us to deduce the 1S-2S triplet scattering
length, which has been calculated by Jamieson, Dalgarno, and Doyle [6]. The frequency
shift also provides a probe of the density distribution of our trapped sample, and constitutes
a valuable tool for the study of Bose-Einstein condensation. (See the accompanying paper
on BEC in atomic hydrogen [7].)

Interactions between neighboring atoms shift and broaden atomic spectral lines. For
bosons at low temperatures, where only s-wave collisions occur (below about 1 K for H [8]),
the elastic contribution to the shift can be described through a density-dependent mean ﬁeld
energy [9]

for an atom in a gas of density n. Here, a is the atom’s s-wave scattering length for collisions
in the gas, and all particles have mass m. Consideration of particle exchange yields ǫ = 2
for collisions between identical atoms in the same internal state and diﬀerent translational
states, and ǫ = 1 otherwise. The diﬀerence between the mean ﬁeld energy in the excited
and ground states results in a frequency shift. For weak excitation of the 1S-2S transition

where the scattering lengths are for the triplet potentials.

Additional contributions to the shift can result from inelastic processes. The most im-
portant corrections should arise from collisional hyperﬁne transitions and quenching of the
2S state. Hyperﬁne transitions in the spin-polarized sample arise only through weak mag-
netic dipole interactions [11], and in our experiment we observe no evidence for collisional
quenching on a millisecond time scale. Thus it is reasonable to neglect inelastic processes
when describing the observed density-dependent frequency shift.

Analogous frequency shifts are observed in hydrogen masers [12] and cesium atomic
fountains [13], for example. Using the collision-based formalism commonly applied to these
systems, it can be shown that homogeneous broadening due to elastic collisions is negligible
in the present study because the phase shift per collision, 2πa/λdeBroglie, is small.

Our techniques for cooling and trapping hydrogen have been described elsewhere [14]
and are only brieﬂy summarized here. Molecules are dissociated in a cryogenic discharge,
and the atoms thermalize by collisions with the 250 mK liquid 4He-coated cell wall and each
other. A fraction of the “low-ﬁeld seeking” F = 1, mF = 1 atoms settle into the magnetic
ﬁeld minimum of a 500 mK deep Ioﬀe-Pritchard magnetic trap [15] (Fig. 1). An axial bias
ﬁeld of a few gauss in the trapping region inhibits nonadiabatic spin ﬂips.

2

The wall temperature is decreased to 120 mK. This increases the wall residence time of H
atoms, facilitating recombination, so that contact with the wall eﬀectively removes energetic
atoms. This process initiates evaporative cooling [16,17] and thermally disconnects the
sample from the wall. The evaporation is forced by decreasing the trap depth, which is set
by a saddlepoint in the magnetic ﬁeld. Sample temperatures as low as 110 µK and densities
approaching 1014 cm−3 are achieved. Under these conditions the sample is a needle-shaped
cloud with a diameter of 200 µm and a length of 8 cm.

The speed with which the trap threshold can be lowered is limited by the need to main-
tain thermal equilibrium through elastic collisions during the evaporation. After the forced
evaporation is terminated, the sample temperature remains constant.
Its value is deter-
mined by the balance between cooling due to evaporation of atoms over the threshold and
heating due to dipolar spin-ﬂip collisions. Dipolar decay preferentially removes atoms from
the bottom of the trap where the density is highest.

The temperature [18] and density [17] are measured by rapidly lowering the trap threshold
to zero while monitoring the power deposited on a bolometer. The power results from
molecular recombination and is proportional to the ﬂux of atoms escaping from the trap. The
dependence of the ﬂux on the threshold reveals the energy distribution of atoms in the trap,
which, combined with a knowledge of the trapping ﬁelds, yields the sample temperature.

We measure the density by releasing the atoms from the trap after holding them for
diﬀerent times t following the forced evaporation. The total recombination energy deposited
on the bolometer is proportional to N(t), the number of atoms remaining in the trap at time
t. N(t) decreases with time due to dipolar decay, which removes atoms from the sample at a
density-dependent rate (Fig. 2). This process obeys the two-body equation dn/dt = −gn2,
where n is the local density and g = 1.1 ×10−15 cm3/s is the calculated rate constant [11,19].
When averaged over the density distribution in the trap, this implies that N(t) obeys [17]

N(0)/N(t) = 1 + κgn0(0)t.

(3)

Here, n0(t) is the maximum density in the sample at time t, and κ is a numerical factor which
depends on the trap geometry. Computations show that κ is typically in the range 0.2–0.3.
For a given geometry, the uncertainty in κ is 10%, arising from imperfect knowledge of the
magnetic ﬁelds. The number of atoms for a given trapping conﬁguration is reproducible to
a few percent.

Once the sample temperature and density are known, we measure the cold collision
frequency shift by two-photon Doppler-free 1S-2S spectroscopy [20]. The 243 nm laser that
excites atoms to the metastable 2S state is stabilized by an optical cavity and has a linewidth
of about 1 kHz. 8 mW of radiation is focused to a waist radius of w0 = 50 µm in the trap.
The beam lies along the axis of the atom cloud and is retro-reﬂected by a spherical mirror
to provide the standing wave required for Doppler-free excitation. A mechanical chopper
pulses the laser beam at 1 kHz with a 50% duty cycle. Following each pulse, an electric ﬁeld
of 10 V/cm Stark-quenches the excited atoms by mixing the 2S and 2P wavefunctions. This
causes prompt radiative decay by emission of a Lyman-α photon (122 nm). The emitted
photons are counted using a microchannel plate detector located at the end of the trap,
behind the retro-reﬂecting mirror. Due to the low collection solid angle (2 × 10−2 ster),
absorptive losses, and detector quantum eﬃciency, the total detection eﬃciency is only
10−5.

Typical data for determining the cold collision frequency shift is shown in Fig. 3a. The
density is highest immediately after the forced evaporation, so the ﬁrst recorded spectrum
is shifted the most. Due to the distribution of densities in the sample, the line is in-
homogeneously broadened. The density decreases on a 20 s time scale primarily due to
collisions with helium atoms evaporated from the mirror surface by the laser; hence suc-
cessive scans probe diﬀerent densities. The later spectra exhibit the exponential lineshape,
exp(−|ν|/δνtransit) [21], expected for Doppler-free two-photon excitation by a Gaussian laser
beam of a low density sample. Here, ν is the laser detuning from resonance at 243 nm in
Hz, δνtransit =
2kBT /m/(4πw0) is the linewidth due to the ﬁnite interaction time of an
atom with the laser beam – typically 2–5 kHz. Measurement of the low density linewidth
provides an independent check of our sample temperature [20].

q

To quantify the cold collision frequency shift, one must account for the distribution of
densities in the trap. Numerical simulations of the spectra show that the shift of the line
center is about 0.75 of the shift associated with the maximum density in the sample, n0.
This factor depends on the trapping magnetic ﬁelds, sample temperature, and laser focus
position with respect to the atom cloud. There is a 10% uncertainty in this correction for a
given conﬁguration.

The integral of the 1S-2S spectrum is proportional to n0(t), and it decreases smoothly
in time. This allows us to extrapolate from the initial density before the ﬁrst scan, found
as described above, to determine the density for each successive scan. A ﬁt to data such as
shown in Fig. 3b yields χ, where χ = ∆ν1S−2S/n. Measurement errors are small compared
to the mentioned systematic uncertainties. The long term drift of the laser frequency, ∼ 10
kHz/hour, is taken into account. Note that no knowledge of absolute frequency is required
to determine χ from a given series of scans.

To examine the sensitivity to systematic eﬀects, χ was measured in diﬀerent trap conﬁg-
urations, with sample temperatures between 110 and 500 µK and initial maximum densities
in the range (2 ∼ 7) × 1013 cm−3. In Fig. 4, the various measurements are plotted versus
sample temperature. We observe no signiﬁcant temperature dependence of the shift, consis-
tent with theory. Any signiﬁcant nonlinear density dependence of the shift would manifest
itself in data such as Fig. 3b, but none is evident.

From a weighted average of the various measurements, we ﬁnd χ = −3.8 ± 0.8 ×
10−10 Hz cm3.
In an apparatus optimized for spectroscopy with better known magnetic
ﬁeld and laser geometries, the uncertainty could be greatly reduced. A revision of the cal-
culated value for g would cause a proportional change in the value of χ. Experiments have
veriﬁed this decay constant at the 20% level [22], but since the calculation involves well
known ground state potentials, the calculated value is expected to be more certain.

Equation 2 relates χ to the s-wave triplet scattering lengths, assuming inelastic processes
can be neglected. From this, we derive a1S−2S = −2.9±0.6 nm. We have used the theoretical
value of a1S−1S = 0.0648 nm [23], which constitutes only a small contribution to χ. The
value calculated by Jamieson et al. [6], a1S−2S = −2.3 nm, is in reasonable agreement with
this measurement.

Having calibrated the cold collision frequency shift, we can use two-photon spectroscopy
to measure sample density provided the shift is comparable to or greater than the transit-
time width, δνtransit. The spectrum, S(ν), is given by the approximate expression

temperatures, and especially in the regime of Bose-Einstein condensation, this probe is more
sensitive and accurate than the bolometer. In addition, it provides valuable information on
the density distribution [7].

1S-2S spectroscopy of cold trapped hydrogen can be used for optical frequency metrology
and precision measurements. Linewidths of about 1 kHz have been achieved in an atomic
beam [24], but with the long coherence time possible in a trap [20] it should be feasible to
approach the 1.3 Hz natural linewidth of the transition. To reduce the eﬀects of the cold
collision shift below this level, it is desirable to work at densities of ≤ 1010 cm−3. Even with
such a decreased density, large signal rates are still possible in an apparatus optimized for
optical access.

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the apparatus. Coils create a magnetic ﬁeld with a minimum
along the trap axis, which conﬁnes the sample. The 243 nm laser beam is focused to a 50 µm
beam radius and retroreﬂected. A 500 µs laser pulse promotes some atoms to the metastable 2S
state. An electric ﬁeld then Stark-quenches the 2S atoms, and the resulting Lyman-α ﬂuorescence
photons are counted by the microchannel plate. Not shown is the trapping cell which surrounds
the sample and is thermally anchored to a dilution refrigerator. The actual trap is longer and
narrower than indicated in the diagram.

Abstract. The general expression for excitation cross section of polarized atoms by
polarized electrons is derived by using the methods of the theory of an atom adapted
for polarization. The special cases of the general expression for the description of the
angular distribution and alignment of excited atoms in the case of polarized and non-
polarized atoms as well as the magnetic dichroism of the total ionization cross section
of polarized atoms are obtained. The cross sections and alignment parameters for the
excitation of the autoionizing states 2p53s2 2P3/2 for Na and 3p54s2 2P3/2 for K are
calculated in distorted wave with exchange approximation.

1. Introduction

Polarized atoms and ions presents in plasma where directed ﬂows of charged particles
take place. The directed movement of these particles is very important in laboratory and
astrophysical plasmas resulting in the distortion of Maxwellian distribution of electrons
[1]. The non-equilibrium population of magnetic sub-levels or the ordering of angular
momentum of atomic particles that is called a self-alignment is causes the polarization
of the emitted electromagnetic ﬂuorescence radiation that could be used for the fusion
plasma diagnostics [2]. Recently, the methods of the theory of an atom were applied for
the derivation of the general expressions describing the interaction of polarized photons
and electrons with polarized atoms and ions [3-9]. The probability (cross section) of the
interaction was expressed as multiple expansion over the multipoles (irreducible tensors)
of the state of all particles taking part in the process both in initial and ﬁnal states. The
applied approach was an alternative to the density matrix method [10] where the density
matrix elements were expressed via multipoles or statistical tensors. The density matrix
formalism was used for the study of some special cases of the polarization of the particles
presented in the excitation process. These expressions were applied for the calculations
of the alignment of autoionizing states of alkaline atoms excited by electrons [11, 12, 13],
positrons [11] or other charged particles [12] The expressions for the description of the
polarization and angular distribution of the radiation from unpolarized atoms excited
by polarized electrons were derived by Bartschat et al [14] in a general case. These
expressions were applied for the calculation of the electron impact excitation of the 4
1P1 state of calcium [15, 16].

The main task of the present work was the derivation of a general expression
describing the polarization state of all particles taking part in the excitation of polarized
atoms by polarized electrons with the help of the method based on the theory of an
atom [3]. The next section of the present work is devoted to obtaining of the general
expression. Its special cases as well the calculations of total cross section and alignment
parameters are presented in Section 3. The inequality

is also assumed. The modiﬁcations enabling to take into account hyperﬁne structure
splitting can be easily made [3, 5].

The integration over orbital and summation over spin variables was performed with
the help of the graphical technique of the angular momentum [17, 18]. The angular
momentum diagrams used for the derivation of the general expression of the excitation
cross section of polarized atoms by polarized electrons are represented in ﬁgures 1 and 2.
The angular part of the matrix element (8) is represented in diagram E1 (see ﬁgure 1).
Here the rectangle with (kk) indicates the orbital and spin parts of the electrostatic
interaction operator which orbital part is deﬁned as follows:

Here and 1 and 2 show the atomic and projectile electrons, respectively. Other rectangles

quantum numbers. The circles with D inside are Wigner rotation matrices. The electron
was excited from the shell which orbital quantum number is l0 to the shell which orbital
quantum number is l1, and s = 1/2.

To extract the reduced matrix element from diagram E1, one needs to cut of the
Wigner rotation matrices from the open lines of each angular momentum (circles with
D) and to choose the order of the coupling of open lines. Let us choose the following
order of coupling: J0, λ1s(j1)J and J1, λ2s(j2)J. Then the procedure of the extraction
of the reduced matrix element may be written by using the diagrams from ﬁgure 1

3.1. Total cross section for the excitation of unpolarized atoms

In the case when the polarization state of excited atoms and scattered electrons are
not registered, the total cross section describing the excitation of unpolarized atoms by
unpolarized electrons can be obtained from the general expression (13) by summation

3.2. The angular distribution of scattered electrons following the excitation of
unpolarized atoms

The excitation of unpolarized atoms by unpolarized electrons is usual and often occurred
process in plasmas. To obtain the expression of the diﬀerential cross section suitable for
the description of the angular distribution of scattered electrons one needs to performer
the summation of the general expression (13) over the magnetic components of the
particles in the ﬁnal state and averaging over them in the initial state. The application
of the expression (15) and the choice of the laboratory quantization axes along the
direction of the projectile electron, that means YKN (0, 0) = [(2K + 1)/4π]1/2δ(N, 0),
leads to the expression

In the case of the atoms prepared in polarized state, the expression for the diﬀerential
cross section describing the angular distribution of the scattered electrons can be also
obtained by the summation over the magnetic components of the particles in the ﬁnal
state and averaging over the states of the spin in the initial state in the general expression

3.5. The alignment of unpolarized atoms excited by electron-impact

Usually the alignment of the excited atom eﬀects the characteristics of the second step
processes [7, 8]. Therefore the special expression should be used in this case. It can be
obtained with the help of the method presented by Kupliauskien˙e [3, 7] for (13) and is
as follows:

The cross section describing the alignment of excited atoms can be obtained by
the integration over the angles of scattered electrons, summation over the magnetic
components of the spin of scattered electrons and averaging over the states of atoms
and electrons in the initial state of the expressions (31). Its expression is as follows:

are used in the creation of computer program in FORTRAN. The calculations of the
total cross section and alignment parameter for the excitation the autoionizing states
of 2p53s2 2P3/2 for Na and 3p54s2 2P3/2 for K are carried out as an example. The cross
sections are displayed in ﬁgure 3, and the alignment parameters are shown in ﬁgure 4.
The distorted wave (DW) with exchange approximation and multiconﬁguration wave
functions [19] are used. The calculations in plane wave Born (PWB) approximation were
also performed in the present work. The correlation eﬀects are important and decrease
the values of the cross section about 7% for Na and 8% for K. It can be expected because
the dominant expansions are 0.96 2p53s2+0.26 2p53p2 and 0.95 3p54s2+0.30 3p54p2
0.09 3p54s(3P)3d for Na and K, respectively. In the case of Na, the
−
cross sections for the term 2P were calculated in order to make the comparison with
experimental data [20]. The cross sections calculated in DW and PWB approximations
are in close agreement with those obtained by Borovik et al
in the same
approximations, therefore they are not presented in ﬁgure 3 for comparison.

The results from ﬁgure 3 show that the values of calculated cross sections merge
with experimental data [20, 21, 22] for the incident electron energies about three times

larger than excitation threshold both for Na and K. A sharp increase of the excitation
cross section near threshold for K is caused by the exchange scattering as it disappears
in the cross section calculated in DW without exchange.

The results of ﬁgure 4 show that calculated in DW approximation alignment
parameters of the state 3p54s2 2P3/2 in K excited by electron impact are in good
agreement with experimentally determined [23] over a broad range of incident electron
energies. This agreement can be explained that an important part of the excitation
mechanisms cancels in the ratio of the excitation cross sections for diﬀerent magnetic
sublevels. The values of the alignment parameter for K of the present work are close
to those obtained by Materstock et al [23] in DW approximation with exchange using
some optical potential. For the excitation energies exceeding the threshold twice, the
calculated alignment parameters for Na in the state 2p53s2 2P3/2 are also in good
agreement with experimental data [13] and values calculated by applying R-matrix
approach [13]. Signiﬁcant deviations of the alignment parameters calculated in the
present work from those of experimental data and R-matrix calculations can be noticed
close to the excitation threshold indicating the importance of the correlations in the
continuum. For large excitation energies, the PWB approximation can be used to
calculate the alignment parameters for Na and K atoms.

5. Concluding remarks

The general expression for the cross section describing the excitation of polarized
atoms by polarized electrons as a multiple expansion over the multipoles of the states
of all particles participating in the process both in the initial and ﬁnal states was
obtained for the ﬁrst time. A simple way to derive expressions for special cases by
using the general expression is described. In the case of the excitation of unpolarized
atoms by unpolarized electrons, more simple expressions for the total cross section,
parameters of the alignment of excited atoms and the asymmetry parameters of the
angular distribution of the scattered electrons are obtained from the general expression.
The derivation of the degree of magnetic dichroism as well as the parameters of
the asymmetry of the angular distribution of scattered electrons in the case of the
excitation of polarized atoms by unpolarized electrons are also demonstrated by using
the general expression. The special expressions are implemented into computer code.
The calculations of the total cross section and alignment parameter for the excitation
the autoionizing states of 2p53s2 2P3/2 for Na and 3p54s2 2P3/2 for K are carried out as an
example. The calculated in DW approximation alignment parameters of the state 3p54s2
2P3/2 in K excited by electron impact are in good agreement with those experimentally
determined over a broad range of incident electron energies. Signiﬁcant deviations of
the alignment parameters calculated in the present work from those of experimental
data and R-matrix calculations noticed close to the excitation threshold indicate the
importance of the correlations in the continuum.

Direct imaging of periodic sub-wavelength patterns of total atomic density

Interference fringes of total atomic density with period λ/4 and λ/2 for optical wavelength λ,
have been produced in de Broglie atom interferometer and directly imaged by means of an “optical
mask” technique. The imaging technique allowed us to observe sub-wavelength periodic patterns
with a resolution of λ/16. The quantum dynamics near the interference times as a function of the
recoil phase and pulse areas has been investigated.

An interferometer based on the interaction of a pair of
oﬀ-resonant standing wave pulses (made from laser ﬁelds
with wavelength λ) with a cold gas of Rb atoms [1] has
been shown to be capable of precision measurement of
the atomic recoil frequency, ~/m and inertial forces such
as gravity [2, 3, 4, 5].

If the standing-wave pulses in this interferometer are
separated by time T , theory predicts that at times t ∼
[(n + 1)/n]T for positive integer n, fringe patterns of the
total atomic density of period λ/2n should appear [6].
Such fringes are the manifestation of matter-wave diﬀrac-
tion [7, 8]. Evidence of these λ/2n period gratings has
been observed indirectly in Ref. [9] by use a backscatter-
ing technique in a heterodyne arrangement, but no direct
observation of small-period fringes has been made until
now.

To observe such small period structures directly, we
have developed a real-time imaging technique for 85Rb
atoms [10]. This “optical mask” [11, 12] technique, was
applied to atoms of 85Rb initially prepared in the ground
hyperﬁne level F = 3. An “optical mask” is a standing
wave (SW) resonant to the F = 3 → F ′ = 3 transition
(5S1/2 → 5P3/2, λ = 780 nm). For a pulse of suﬃcient
intensity and duration, atoms not located at the nodes of
the SW will be optically pumped into the F=2 level. For
imaging the density at a particular time, a “detection se-
quence” is applied, consisting of an optical mask followed
by a traveling wave pulse tuned to the closed transition
F = 3 → F ′=4. After the mask was applied, atoms left
unpumped at the nodes were counted by observation of
ﬂuorescence in the traveling wave. The ﬂuorescent signal
is proportional to the density at the nodes just before the
application of the imaging mask. To map out the den-
sity as a function of position, the initial density proﬁle
is reproduced and the measurement repeated with vari-
ous locations of the detection mask node within the mask
period of λ/2.

In this work we applied the “optical mask” technique
to directly image the fringe structures in an atom inter-
ferometer consisting of two oﬀ-resonant SW pulses sep-
arated by a time T , each consisting of two linearly po-
larized traveling waves blue detuned from the F = 3 →
F ′ = 4 transition. Each SW pulse acts as a phase grat-
ing for the atoms. These phase gratings do not change
the internal state of an atom and only alter its center of

mass. A given initial atomic momentum state is split into
a superposition of momentum states diﬀering by twice
the photon momentum. This superposition results in a
evolving fringe pattern that washes out due to a spread
in the initial momentum distribution of the atoms. The
second pulse results in removal of the initial momentum
dependence of the gratings at various times (referred to
as echo’s). The times of the echos can be predicted by
a classical analysis, but the size and shape of the fringes
can only be understood in terms the quantum behavior.
At times close to the echo time t = T (n + 1)/n, one
expects to ﬁnd a periodicity in the atomic density of λ/2n
because the minimum diﬀerence between the momenta
of interfering states is n~q, where q = k1 − k2 = 2k is a
grating vector for a SW consisting of two traveling waves
(k1, k2). It is an interesting fact that because the atoms
interact with phase gratings, there are no interference
fringes at exactly the echo times; only an atomic phase
modulation exists at these times. This is in a contrast
of use absorptive (amplitude) gratings to create periodic
structures where the maximum of the interference occurs
at the exact echo times.

A simple interference signal calculation (assuming
Raman-Nath regime), which only takes into the account
the lowest spatial harmonic of the density grating is pre-
sented in Ref. [9]. We can extend this result to include all
harmonics by writing the resulting density as a Fourier
series:

where the N2th Fourier harmonic is built up by inter-
fering matter waves whose momenta diﬀer by N2 recoils
after SW2. Because of Doppler dephasing, gratings occur
only near echo times

where Ω is a two photon Rabi frequency and τi are the
pulse durations. The recoil frequency ωq = ~q2/2matom,
and u is the spread in initial velocities.

A density pattern of period λ/2n at an echo point can
be obtained by letting −N1/N2 = m/n, where positive
integers m and n are expressed in lowest terms, and the
sum in Eq. (1) only includes values of N2 for which both
N1 and N2 are integers. We get the corresponding echo
time techo

n,m = T (n + m)/n.

shown pulses that change the phase between k1 and k2 and a

In our experiments we consider only the primary

Because of the exponential term in the sum, for small
periodicity λ/2n with n ≫ 1 eﬀectively only the ﬁrst
harmonic N = 1 contributes to the signal. However for

2

n small (for example λ/2 periodicity at time 2T ) higher
harmonics contribute to the signal and deﬁne its spatial
proﬁle.

interesting to look at the time dependence of the density
at the echo time around 2T , for ∆t → 0 from Eq. (4)
we get ρ2T (∆t) ∼ ∆t everywhere but at ωqT = π, where
ρ2T (∆t) ∼ ∆t3, which shows the signiﬁcance of the recoil
phase. The above expressions can also be used to esti-
mate the temperature of the trapped atoms (∼ u), since
the eﬀective width of the signal is ∆t ∼ 1/(qu).

In the experiment 85Rb atoms are prepared from a
vapor in a MOT. The experiment is done in the time
domain with pulsed laser ﬁelds and repeated every 50
ms. The experimental setup and the time diagram of the
experiment is shown in Fig. 1.

At the time t = 0 and t = T two oﬀ-resonant standing-
wave pulses (SW1, SW2) are applied with the typical
pulse durations of 200–480 ns. The pulses are blue-
shifted from the closest transition 5S1/2(F = 3) →
5P3/2(F ′ = 4) of 85Rb, the detuning (∆) varied from
30 MHz to 105 MHz (≃ 5 to 18 excited state linewidths
correspondingly). This detuning allowed us to minimize
the eﬀects of spontaneous emission, so in our experiment
less than 5 % of the atoms spontaneously emit during
each pulse. The SW pulses are composed of two counter-
propagating traveling waves k1 and k2 with the intensity
in each beam ≈ 200 mW/cm2, which are switched on
and oﬀ independently by two acousto-optic modulators
(AOMs), driven by a common 220 MHz rf oscillator.

The density grating of the atomic cloud is probed
around speciﬁc echo times by switching on the detection
sequence consisting of the optical mask SW and a weak
traveling wave for measuring the ﬂuorescence, which is
aligned in the horizontal plane, at an angle 45◦ to the
mask beams. The standing wave for the optical mask
is created by two counter-propagating traveling waves
(TWs) having horizontal linear polarization and the in-
tensity in each beam is 40 to 120 mW/cm2. The nodes
of the optical mask are shifted relative to the nodes of
the oﬀ-resonant SWs by changing the phase of the rf
feeding one of the AOMs. The read-out ﬁeld on the cy-
cling F = 3 → F ′ = 4 transition is pulsed by a sepa-
rate AOM. All of the AOMs are driven by the same rf
source. Additionally to minimize the phase drift during a
single repetition of the experiment the oﬀ-resonant and
resonant (optical mask) SWs were passed through the
same set of optics. To shift the frequency of the SWs be-
tween diﬀerent phases of the experiment, we modulated
the laser current. In our experiment, both oﬀ-resonant
SWs used to create the pattern have the same pulse areas
θ1 = θ2 = θ. However one can mimic θ2 6= θ1 by varying
recoil phase (∼ T ), since the density function [Eq. (4)] is

periodic in both the recoil phase and the pulse area.

FIG. 2: Total atomic density as a function of a phase shift of
the optical mask SW in the vicinity of an echo time 2T . The
curve is a model function ﬁt to the data. The actual data
were taken for ∆x ∈ {−λ/4, λ/4} and then repeated with
the period λ/2: a)T = 60µs, ∆t = 1µs, θ = 4.5, η = 0.94,
V = 22%; b)T = 62µs, ∆t = −1µs, θ = 4.6, η = 0.94,
V = 20%;. The data are normalized to the uniform atomic
density (no oﬀ-resonant pulses applied prior to the imaging
sequence).

In Fig. 2 we plot the spatial structures with the period
λ/2, observed at the time ∼ 2T . To maximize visibilities
of the fringes the data were taken with slightly diﬀerent
values of the recoil phase (∼ T ) for the two graphs with
pulse area ﬁxed. There is a phase shift of π between
the two fringe patterns taken for opposite ∆t (up to a
systematic shift in the phase calibration over the several
day interval between two data sets). This phase shift
represents the nature of the interferometer used to cre-
ate the atomic interference pattern and it is predicted by
the theory. The data on the graphs are normalized to
the uniform atomic density distribution obtained when
no oﬀ-resonant SWs are applied prior to the imaging se-
quence. The atomic loss is represented by the parameter
η obtained from the model ﬁt to the data. In the ideal
case of no atomic loss η = 1, in practice it is 6% – 13%
less than that. The background due to stray photons is
subtracted.

All the data are ﬁtted by the model function (curve
on the ﬁgure), which is Eq. (4) convolved with an optical

mask, modeled by a Gaussian transmission function [10].
The model function allows one to determine some impor-
tant parameters such as the pulse area θ, the width of the
optical mask σ and an atomic loss η. The temperature
of the atoms can be deduced given that (from the ﬁt) the
Doppler broadening term is 1/qu ≃ 1.5 µs, corresponding
to a temperature of ∼ 15 µK.

The particular choice of the pulse area θ and the
separation between the pulses T was chosen to maxi-
mize the visibility of the fringes, which is deﬁned by
V ≡ (ρmax − ρmin)/(ρmax + ρmin). For the data in
Fig. 2 the signal visibility is V = 22% (a) and V = 20%
(b), however the atomic density visibility is V0 ∼ 33%
(determined by eﬀectively deconvolving the optical mask
transmission function from the signal).

By combining several cross-sections of spatial proﬁles
with period λ/2, each taken at a diﬀerent value of ∆t, one
can directly view the dynamics of the interference fringes,
reconstructing eﬀectively a “two-dimensional” proﬁle of
the atomic density, where one coordinate is a time ∆t and

the other is a spatial phase ∆x. In Fig. 3 we present such
plots. For part (a) in the ﬁgure, the plot represents the
interpolation of the real data, taken for ∆x ∈ {−λ/4,
λ/4} and repeated with the period λ/2. For part (b)
we plot the corresponding theoretical function for the
atomic density [Eq. (4)] convoluted with the optical mask
transmission function.

smaller term e−(nN qu∆t/2)
in the expression for the to-
tal atomic density Eq. (4). The maximum visibility of the
signal V = 12% is obtained for ∆t = 0.5 µs, T=60µs [see
Fig. 4(b)]. For Fig. 4(a) and (b) visibilities of the signals
are V = 9% V = 12% however the atomic density has
visibilities of V0 ≈ 20% and V0 ≈ 22% correspondingly.

The fringe patterns at times t = 3T /2 − ∆t and
t = 3T /2 + ∆t also have a relative phase shift of π [be-
tween (a) and (b) parts of Figs. 4]. The atomic density
with sub-wavelength period has slightly diﬀerent dynam-
ics around ∆t = 0 than the λ/2 period fringes. For the
recoil phase ωqT is equal to an integer multiple of π, for
∆t → 0 the density function behaves as ∼ ∆t4. This is a
manifestation of quantum behavior of the atomic center
of mass, and the signal is extremely diﬃcult to obtain for
such conditions.

It is worth pointing out, in contrast to Ref. [13], that
the atom losses from the creating SWs are very small
for this experiment and vary as 13% − 3% for the data
presented (estimated from the ﬁt parameter η). To date,
we only produced patterns with period ≥ λ/4 although
smaller periodicities can be obtained in a similar fashion
up to the ultimate resolution of the optical mask imaging
technique of λ/16.

To conclude, we have directly observed and investi-
gated atomic gratings of total atomic density with period
λ/2n for n ≥ 2 in an atom interferometer.

We are grateful to A. Turlapov for useful discussions.

FIG. 4: Total atomic density as a function of a phase shift of
the optical mask SW in the vicinity of an echo time 3T /2, the
curve is a model function ﬁt to the data: a) ∆t = −0.5 µs,
θ = 3.2, η = 0.87, V = 9%, error bars represents statistics
from several runs; b) ∆t = 0.5 µs, θ = 4.2, η = 0.91, V = 12%;
The data are normalized to the uniform atomic density.

We have also observed directly the spatial proﬁle of the
total atomic density with sub-wavelength period (here
λ/4). In this experiment the imaging sequence was ap-
plied at t ∼ 3T /2 and the intensities of the pulses were
the same as for the data in Fig. 2, the duration of the
pulses were adjusted to maximize the contrast of the sig-
nal.

The resulting atomic density patterns are shown in
Fig. 4. The observed sub-wavelength period structures
have lower visibility than for the density of period λ/2,
due to the fact that interfering trajectories with high
number of the recoils have lower amplitudes. Also for
the λ/2n (here n = 2) period patterns, maximum vis-
ibility occurs at smaller ∆t than for n = 1 due to a

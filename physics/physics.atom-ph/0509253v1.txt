Abstract
We present an accurate ab initio method of calculating isotope shifts and relativistic shifts in
atomic spectra. We test the method on neutral carbon and three carbon ions. The relativistic
shift of carbon lines may allow them to be included in analyses of quasar absorption spectra
that seek to measure possible variations in the ﬁne structure constant α over the lifetime of the
Universe. Carbon isotope shifts can be used to measure isotope abundances in gas clouds: isotope
abundances are potentially an important source of systematic error in the α–variation studies.
These abundances are also needed to study nuclear reactions in stars and supernovae, and test
models of chemical evolution of the Universe.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies of quasar absorption systems have suggested that the ﬁne structure con-
stant, α = e2/¯hc, may have been smaller in the early universe than it is today on Earth
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Other groups using diﬀerent telescopes have shown zero variation [5, 6, 7]. All
of these studies use the “many multiplet” method [8], which relies on the comparison of the
wavelengths of many transitions in many ions to enhance the size of the eﬀects and remove
sources of systematic error. While this method oﬀers an order-of-magnitude improvement
in sensitivity over the previously used alkali-doublet method, a potential systematic error is
introduced related to the isotope abundances of the absorbers. If the isotope abundances of
the absorbers diﬀer from the terrestrial abundances then there can be spurious shifts in the
measured wavelengths which may be incorrectly interpreted as variation of α.

This problem can be resolved if both the relativistic shift and isotope shift of each tran-
sition is known, by using particular combinations of the transition frequencies as probes
which are insensitive to either α-variation or isotopic abundances [9]. Changes in the iso-
tope abundances and the ﬁne-structure constant can then be measured directly.

The measured isotopic abundance of carbon can be used to test models of chemical
evolution of the Universe. Of particular importance are some chemical evolution models
with enhanced populations of intermediate-mass stars that serve as factories for heavy Mg
isotopes. The changes in the relative abundances of Mg isotopes could account for much of
the evidence for variation in α at relatively low redshifts (z <
∼ 2) [10, 11]. However, these
models also overproduce nitrogen, violating observed abundance trends in high-z damped
Lyman-α systems. Furthermore, it has been shown that such models would also increase
the ratio of 13C to 12C [12]. With the isotope shifts calculated in this paper it is possible to
measure this ratio, and hence provide a diagnostic of these non-standard chemical evolution
models.

We also have one more reason to study carbon:

it is a well studied atom, and we can
compare the results of our method with those of other theoretical analyses, as well as a
few experiments (unfortunately, isotope shifts for the majority of lines used in astrophysical
applications have not been measured). In particular, much progress has been made to cal-
culate isotope shifts using the multiconﬁgurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF) and conﬁguration
interaction (CI) approach [13, 14, 15, 16]. In Sections II and III we present our method of
calculating the isotope shift. It uses the ﬁnite-ﬁeld method to reduce the problem of isotope
shift (or relativistic shift) to that of an energy calculation. The transition energies are cal-
culated using a combination of the conﬁguration interaction and many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) approaches, following the works of Refs. [17] and [18].

In Sec. IV we show that our CI + MBPT method has accuracy comparable to that of the
MCHF calculations, and are accurate enough to be used to measure isotope abundances.
We believe that our method may have some advantages over the MCHF calculations; in
particular, it is more readily applicable to heavier atoms (where we need to calculate isotope
shifts for the study of the α variation and isotopic evolution) and has already been shown to
be more accurate in the case of Mg I [19]. We also use this method to calculate dependence
of the carbon transition frequencies on α, which is needed to study α variation.

II. METHOD

Using many-body perturbation theory in the residual Coulomb operator and speciﬁc
mass shift (SMS) operator to calculate isotope shift shows poor convergence. Therefore,
we are looking for an “all order” method of calculation. The ﬁnite-ﬁeld scaling method is
used, reducing the task to an energy calculation, and including the SMS in all parts of the
calculation. A similar idea is used to calculate relativistic shift.

A. Relativistic shift

To measure α in the distant past, we compare the frequency of transitions in the labo-
ratory, ω0, with those measured in the quasar absorption spectra, ω. The diﬀerence can be
expressed as

ω = ω0 + qx,
where x = (α/α0)2 − 1 and α0 is the laboratory value of the ﬁne structure constant. We
vary α directly in computer codes, and extract the relativistic shift q from the calculated
spectrum as

(1)

dω
dx (cid:12)
x=0
(cid:12)
Thus we have reduced the problem to an accurate numerical calculation of the energy, and
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
hence ω.

q =

B.

Isotope shift

The isotope shifts of atomic transition frequencies come from two sources: the ﬁnite size
of the nuclear charge distribution (the “volume” or “ﬁeld” shift), and the ﬁnite mass of
the nucleus (see, e.g., Ref. [20]). In atoms as light as carbon, the ﬁeld shift is negligible in
comparison to the mass shift: we will not consider it further.

Because a real nucleus has a ﬁnite mass, there is a recoil eﬀect from the movements of

the electrons. The energy shift due to the recoil of the nucleus of mass M is given by

This “mass shift” is traditionally divided into the normal mass shift (NMS) and the speciﬁc
mass shift (SMS), given by the ﬁrst and second terms of Eq. (3), respectively. The normal
mass shift is easily calculated from the transition frequency; the speciﬁc mass shift is diﬃcult
to evaluate accurately.

The shift in energy of any transition in an isotope with mass number A′ with respect to

an isotope with mass number A can be expressed as

δνA′,A = νA′

The value 1823 refers to the ratio of the atomic mass unit to the electron mass.

To calculate kSMS we include a scaled speciﬁc-mass-shift operator directly into our energy
calculation from the very beginning. We add the two-body SMS operator to the Coulomb
potential ˜Q = 1/ |r1 − r2| + λp1 · p2. The operator ˜Q replaces the Coulomb operator
everywhere that it appears in an energy calculation. We recover the speciﬁc mass shift
constant as

The operator ˜Q has the same symmetry and structure as the Coulomb operator (see Ap-
pendix A).

III.

ENERGY CALCULATION

To calculate the energies we ﬁrst solve the Dirac-Fock equations for the core and valence
electrons, and we generate a basis set that includes the core and valence orbitals and a
number of virtual orbitals. We then calculate the energy levels using a combination of CI
and MBPT for many-valence-electron atoms as was done for Mg I in Ref. [19]. In this section
we outline the procedure for the combined CI and MBPT method; it generally follows the
work of Ref. [17]. Note that for single-valence-electron atoms, where the CI procedure is
unnecessary, the method reduces to the addition of core-correlation eﬀects to the Dirac-Fock
energy using MBPT, as was shown to be highly successful for calculating SMS in Ref. [21].
Atomic units (¯h = me = e = 1) are used throughout this paper.

A. Single particle basis

We ﬁrstly solve the Dirac-Fock equations for one-particle wavefunctions of the open-shell

core |mi

where

hDF |mi = ǫm |mi ,

hDF = c α · p + (β − 1)mec2 −

+ V NDF(r)

Z
r

where V NDF is the potential (both direct and exchange) of the NDF electrons included in
the self-consistent Hartree-Fock procedure. Note that this is not necessarily the number of
electrons in the closed-shell core, in fact Ncore ≤ NDF ≤ N, where N is the total number of
electrons. For the purposes of the CI calculation there are N − Ncore valence electrons.

We need to generate a basis set, |ii that includes the core and valence states and a
large number of virtual states. In this paper we have used a B-spline basis set, formed by
diagonalizing the Dirac-Fock operator on the basis set of B-splines and excluding orbitals
with high energy. This basis has been shown to be eﬀective in energy calculations using this
method of CI and MBPT [18].

B. Conﬁguration interaction method

The many-electron Hilbert space is separated into subspaces P and Q. P corresponds to
the frozen-core approximation; Q is complimentary to it and includes all states with core
excitations. Using Slater determinants (denoted with capital letters) |Ii of the single-particle
functions |ii as a basis set in the many-electron space, we can deﬁne projection operators
for P and Q by

(14)

P =

|Ii hI|

XI∈P
P + Q = 1

ψ =

CI |Ii ,

XI∈P

HIJ CJ = ECI.

XJ∈P

Determinants that have all core states fully occupied are in the P subspace; all others are
in the subspace Q.

In the CI method, the many-electron wavefunction is expressed as a linear combination

of Slater determinants from the subspace P :

where the CI are obtained from the matrix eigenvalue problem

In the frozen-core approximation, the determinants |Ii need include only the valence elec-
trons. Although P is inﬁnite-dimensional, we can use a ﬁnite-dimensional model subspace
by specifying the set of allowed conﬁgurations for the valence electrons, for example by re-
stricting the set of single particle states. The restrictions we use are diﬀerent for each ion,
and are expressed more fully in the relevant parts of Section IV. We will not distinguish
here between the ﬁnite and inﬁnite subspaces.

The Hamiltonian for the CI problem is a projection of the exact Hamiltonian H onto the

model subspace. The core is frozen in the P subspace, so our projected Hamiltonian is

acts only on the valence electrons. Using the operator (13) in Eq. (12) corresponds to the
pure CI method in the frozen-core approximation.

C. Exact Hamiltonian expansion

We wish to write the exact equivalent of H in the subspace P . The “Feshbach operator”
yields the exact energy when operating on the model function ΨP = PΨ. Following Lindgren
and Morrison [22], we start from the many-body Schr¨odinger equation in the form

H(P + Q)Ψ = EΨ

(15)

5

and operate from the left with P and Q, respectively to obtain

Eliminating ΨQ,

where

PHP ΨP + PHQ ΨQ = EΨP
QHP ΨP + QHQ ΨQ = EΨQ.

[PHP + Σ(E)] ΨP = EΨP

Σ(E) = PHQ

E − QHQ

QHP.

In Ref. [17] these expressions were also used to rewrite the orthonormality conditions for
the solutions of Eq. (15) in terms of the model functions ΨP (the solutions of Eq. (16)).
As they found however, if an appropriate choice of the P subspace is made, the usual
orthonormality condition for ΨP can be applied. In this case the standard CI procedure can
be used to solve Eq. (16).

D. Many-body perturbation theory

Here we will generate a perturbation expansion for Σ. Deﬁne a single particle Hamiltonian

by

ǫi ≡ hi| hDF |ii .

H0 = Ecore +

(23)

One advantage of this formalism is that h0 is not necessarily the same as hDF. Thus we
may in principle use any set of functions we like in the virtual basis as long as they are
orthogonal. In practice, however, it is important that V not get too large, and this requires
that

V (1) = hi| hCI − h0 |ji

is small.

We can write Σ in matrix form:

ΣIJ =

hI| H |Mi hM| H |Ji
E − EM

XM ∈Q

XM,L∈Q

= (Σ2)IJ + (Σ3)IJ + ...

hI| H |Mi hM| V |Li hL| H |Ji
(E − EM )(E − EL)

+ . . .

(24)

(25)

(26)

where I and J enumerate determinants from the subspace P , and M and L are determinants
from the subspace Q.

In this paper we calculate Σ to second-order of the perturbation expansion. For the one-
valence-electron case it has been shown that this level of perturbation theory, when used
with the ﬁnite-ﬁeld scaling method, is suﬃcient to obtain accurate results for isotope shift
[21]. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that energies calculated to this order are
very accurate [17, 18].

Substituting Σ2 into (16) we obtain the equation of the combined CI and MBPT method,

which we write in the same form as Eq. (12):

HIJ +

XM ∈Q

XJ∈P





hI| H |Mi hM| H |Ji
E − EM





CJ = ECI.

(27)

Thus our method includes the core-correlation eﬀects by simply altering the matrix elements
in the CI calculation.
In practice, this involves adding the matrix element of the sigma
operator to the one and two-particle Coulomb integrals.

E. Diagrammatic technique for calculating Σ

Here we present all second-order diagrams for Σ, represented by Goldstone diagrams (see,
e.g.: Ref. [22]). The diagrams are valid for any ion and any choice of core. Unlinked lines
are omitted, since they correspond to states of the valence electrons that are not involved
in the interaction. The omitted lines do aﬀect the value of the MBPT correction via the
Pauli principle; however, as noted in Ref. [17], the Pauli principle can be ignored due to the
exact cancellation of unphysical terms in diﬀerent diagrams. This rule works for all orders
of perturbation theory (this is Wick’s theorem, see e.g.: Ref. [22]).

7

The second-order diagrams can be grouped according to how many external lines (valence
electrons) they have. There are four one-valence-electron diagrams, all shown in Fig. 1. They
correspond to the “self-energy” correction, which describes correlations between the valence
electron and the core. Additionally, there are ﬁve so-called “subtraction diagrams” for the
self-energy. These are diagrams that involve the external ﬁeld V (1) (Eq. (24)), and are so
named because in the Hartree-Fock ﬁeld enters V (1) with a minus sign. In our formulation
we instead use H(1) as the external ﬁeld (see Eqs. (21) and (25)) which is equivalent when
calculating Σ2 because PH0Q = 0. Three of the Σ(1) subtraction diagrams are shown in
Fig. 2; the other two are the mirror image partners of diagrams 2.1 and 2.2.

Diagrams with two external lines correspond to screening of the valence-valence inter-
action by the core electrons. There are nine diagrams represented in Fig. 3, and four
subtraction diagrams represented in Fig. 4. The resulting corrections to the interactions
between valence electrons can be written in the form of an eﬀective radial integral, as is
usually done for the Coulomb integrals. However, it is important to note that the box dia-
grams (Figs. 3.4 – 3.6) have less symmetry than the Coulomb integrals, because swapping
the initial and ﬁnal states in either the upper or lower lines changes the integral. This
approximately doubles the number of independent radial integrals that need to be stored
for the CI problem. In addition, for the box diagrams the multipolarity of the Coulomb
interaction need not follow the usual rule: ξ(la + lc + k)ξ(lb + ld + k) (see Appendix A).
Instead, k need only satisfy the triangle conditions and can be both odd and even. This
would again double the number of independent radial integrals, except that we have found
that the diagrams of “wrong” parity are unimportant for carbon and may be omitted in
order to reduce the complexity of the calculations.

It is worth noting also that the two-body diagrams with the largest contribution to the
energy (the direct diagram, Fig. 3.1, and its mirror) make no (linear) contribution to the
SMS because they cancel. The exchange diagrams do contribute to the SMS; nevertheless,
it is because of this cancellation that the contribution of Σ(2) to kSMS is generally smaller
than that of Σ(1).

Figure 5 shows a diagram with three external lines, Σ(3), where three valence electrons
interact via the core. The diagrams of this type are easy to calculate (having only one
internal summation and no summations over virtual states), but the number of corresponding
eﬀective radial integrals is huge. To include this diagram everywhere in the CI calculation
would involve taking into account not only corrections to H(1) and H(2), but it would also
introduce an eﬀective H(3). Fortunately, as explained in Ref. [17], it is possible to omit these
diagrams entirely provided that one makes an appropriate choice of the atomic core. We
have not included Σ(3) in this paper.

9

FIG. 5: Eﬀective three-valence-electron interaction of Σ2.

Analytical expressions for the diagrams of Figs. 1 – 4 are given in Appendix B.
A ﬁnal point worth mentioning is the deﬁnition of the energy denominators in the ex-
pressions corresponding to the diagrams. Our formalism corresponds to Brillouin-Wigner
perturbation theory, and so there is an explicit dependence on the energy of the whole atom:
E in Eqs. (17) and (27).

From Eq. (13), E = Ecore + Eval, and so the core part cancels in the energy denominator
E −H0 (see Eq. (23)). The energy Eval corresponds to the energy of all the valence electrons.
To calculate H0, however, one should take into account the state of all valence electrons
for each disconnected diagram. This is computationally impractical, but again one can
simplify. In this paper all connected diagrams are evaluated at the energies which correspond
to the main conﬁguration. For example, when calculating Fig. 1.1 the usual Rayleigh-
Shr¨odinger perturbation theory would give the denominator (ǫa + ǫn − ǫα − ǫβ); we instead
use (ǫ2s + ǫn − ǫα − ǫβ) if a and b are s-wave, or (ǫ2p1/2 + ǫn − ǫα − ǫβ) if a is p-wave, and so
on.

The Brillouin-Wigner formalism used in our method has two major advantages over the
Rayleigh-Shr¨odinger perturbation theory. Firstly, we wish to preserve the symmetry of the
CI matrix when Σ is added, so we cannot have an energy denominator that depends on
which state is initial and which is ﬁnal. Secondly, Rayleigh-Shr¨odinger theory does not
allow a large P space as it will produce small denominators for excited conﬁgurations. That
is known to lead to “intruder states” – unphysical states that can lie even below the ground
state. By contrast, Brillouin-Wigner theory is known to have the wrong limit for an inﬁnite
number of valence electrons. It is possible to formulate the theory without these drawbacks
by modifying E (Ref. [23]). However, the energy dependence of the eﬀective Hamiltonian
is a higher order eﬀect; compared to the prescription above, it leads to a relatively small
energy correction that we neglect.

IV. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS

We present results for each species of carbon separately, in order of increasing number of
valence electrons. For all calculations we use a relativistic B-spline single-electron basis set
similar to that developed by Johnson et al.[24, 25, 26]. In all cases the MBPT calculation
considers 1s2 as the core, and all other states as valence. We have used two diﬀerent B-spline
basis sets, each with a diﬀerent number of shells included in the self-consistent Dirac-Fock
procedure. The ﬁrst set, B1, is formed in the potential of the closed shell 1s2 core; this
corresponds to NDF = Ncore. For this set the subtraction diagrams of Figs. 2 and 4 are zero.

10

The second basis set, B2, is formed in the potential of the 1s22s2 core; thus NDF > Ncore
and the subtraction diagrams must be included.

The basis sets are described by giving the largest principal quantum number for each
wave, e.g. 8spd6f includes the orbitals 1 − 8s1/2, 2 − 8pj, 3 − 8dj, and 4 − 6fj. For the
MBPT we have used the basis 40spdf g for all ions. This basis is fully saturated in the sense
that the energies and isotope shifts do not change with the addition of more basis functions.

A. C IV

C IV has one electron above a closed 1s2 core.

It can therefore be treated as a single
valence electron atom using MBPT, or as a three electron atom using CI. We have used both
methods; the results are presented for comparison in Table I. In each case, the calculations
were done using the B1 basis set. The isotope shift results have also been compared with
previous theoretical approaches. Multiconﬁguration Hartree-Fock – CI calculations were
presented in Ref. [13], which also combined the Hylleraas and full-core plus correlation
(FCPC) calculations of Refs. [27] and [28] respectively.

structure.

As noted previously, the MBPT basis was completely saturated, however we have only
included second order diagrams in our calculation. By contrast, the CI calculations are
complete (although they do not include the Breit interaction and QED eﬀects), but the basis
is not completely saturated. We have used an eﬀective 22spd8f basis for the CI calculation,
including only single and double excitations from the leading conﬁgurations (SD-CI). We
included triple excitations for a smaller basis, 14spd8f : this made a diﬀerence of less than
2 cm−1 in the transition energy, and less than 1 GHz·amu for kSMS. Other f -wave and higher
partial waves were also found to be unimportant.

All methods give the same value for the transition energies and SMS constants to within

0.5%.

B. C III

The ground state for C III is 1s22s2 1S0. We have done our calculations both as a four-
electron CI problem (full CI) and by combining two-valence-electron CI with MBPT, consid-
ering 1s2 as the frozen core (CI + Σ(1,2)). All results are presented in Table II. Also included
are CI results (the pure two-electron CI method) and CI + Σ(1) results (that do not include
Σ(2)). This allows us to examine the roles of the diﬀerent parts of the core-correlation. The
CI and CI + Σ(1) results are calculated with the B2 basis set; the complete CI + Σ(1,2)
results have been calculated using both the B1 and B2 sets. Additionally we have presented
the MCHF results of Ref. [15].

For the full four-electron CI method we used a very large basis 16spdf , in the SD-CI
approximation. This was not enough to saturate the basis entirely, and we could go no
further because the Hamiltonian matrix became too large. The error in kSMS from the full
CI calculation could be as large as 100 GHz·amu. Nonetheless, they are in agreement with
the calculations of Ref. [15], as well as the results of our own CI + MBPT.

The CI + MBPT method is particularly accurate for C III for two reasons. Firstly,
because there are only two valence electrons there are no triple excitations, which keeps the

12

Hamiltonian small without the need for approximations (for ions with more valence electrons
we have used the SD-CI approximation). Because the Hamiltonian is relatively small, we
can completely saturate the basis at 20spdf . Also, there is no Σ(3) (corresponding to Fig. 5);
as stated before, in this paper we have not included it anyway. These points hold true for
all two-valence-electron atoms; in particular we have previously shown that excellent results
are attainable for Mg I (Ref. [19]).

In Ref. [15] the MCHF results were given an error of 1%; our CI + MBPT results are
within this range, and so we believe that we have obtained a similar accuracy. It is also
worth noting again that we have excluded the extra box diagrams with “wrong” parity from
the results presented. The inclusion of these diagrams in Σ(2) makes a diﬀerence of around
0.1% to the kSMS constants.

We have treated C II as a three-valence-electron ion; its ground state is 2s22p 2P o

1/2. We
have used the B2 basis 20spdf , which corresponds to the V N −1 potential, and we have
restricted ourselves in the CI problem to single and double excitations from the leading
conﬁgurations 2s22p and 2s2p2.

In Table III we present all results for C II. Again we have presented the breakdown of
the various parts of the CI + MBPT method. We have also performed our calculations
using the B1 basis: this changed the results by less than 1% for all results except for the
2S1/2 transition, in which the diﬀerence was around 3%. For this transition, neither basis set
was enough to completely saturate kSMS. Furthermore, the diﬀerence between the results
of CI + MBPT and MCHF–CI is fairly large for this transition (around 7%). Adding the
next most important conﬁguration, 2s23s, to the leading set changes the energy of the 2S1/2
transition by 30 cm−1 (0.03%) and kSMS by 14 GHz·amu (around 1%). The eﬀect on all
other transitions was much smaller.

C. C II

D. C I

In Table IV we present energies for transitions in neutral carbon. The ground state of C I
is 2s22p2 3P0. We used the B2 basis of size 16spdf , and took all single and double excitations
from several leading conﬁgurations. The energies obtained for this atom are not as good as
those of the other ions. It is testimony to the power of the B-spline basis, however, that
the levels appear in the correct order (with the exception of some ﬁne structure), which is
remarkable considering that the spectrum is very dense.

We have generated q-values for C I because the previous calculations (Ref. [29]) had large
uncertainties. We believe the new values, presented in Table IV, have errors of around
10 cm−1.

In Table V we present the SMS constants for C I. We are within 1% of the values obtained
using the MCHF–CI method (Refs. [13] and [16]). For most transitions the eﬀect of core-
correlations on kSMS is around 1 or 2%, however in some cases they are larger (for example,
in 2s2p3 3P o the core correlations are 8% of the total).

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented, in detail, a method for calculating isotope shifts and
relativistic shifts in atomic spectra. The method uses the ﬁnite-ﬁeld method to reduce the
problem to that of an energy calculation, which is carried out using CI for the valence
electrons combined with MBPT for the core correlations. Having previously tested the
method in magnesium, we have now applied it to transitions in neutral carbon, C II, C III,
and C IV. In all cases we have agreement with previous MCHF and MCHF–CI calculations to

within a few percent. In Table VI we compare our calculations with the few experiments that
exist for carbon ions; in all cases agreement is within around 0.005 cm−1, which corresponds
to an error in kSMS of around 20 GHz·amu.

In Table VII we present total isotope shifts for some important transitions. These tran-
sitions can be observed in quasar absorption spectra, and can therefore be used to probe
variation of α and isotope abundance evolution. The results are presented both in MHz and
km/sec: the latter is the preferred form for use in astronomy.

1 ≤ m, n ≤ Ncore; Ncore + 1 ≤ α, β. Following [22] we use the shorthand notation [j, k, . . .] =
(2j + 1)(2k + 1) . . .. Note also that all Wigner three–j symbols come with a parity selection
rule, which is not explicitly given. This is because the three–j terms come from the formula

−[l1, l2]

1/2

l1 k l2
0 0 0 ! (

j1 j2 k
l2 l1 k )

 

=

k

j1
j2

ξ(l1 + l2 + k).

Additionally, the subtraction diagrams (Figs. 2 and 4) have terms which are matrix elements
of hCI (see Eq. (14)). This operator cannot change the angular momentum of the state; for
example ha| hCI |ni comes with a factor δja jnδla ln which is not presented explicitly.

We start with the contributions to the self-energy matrix elements from the diagrams of
Figs. 1 and 2. All of these expressions have the following additional terms that we do not
write explicitly: δja jb, δma mb, and δla lb.

Next we present contributions to the valence-valence screening diagrams due to the dia-
grams of Figs. 3 and 4. These diagrams have k as an external parameter (not to be summed
over). In the CI procedure they are added to Rk

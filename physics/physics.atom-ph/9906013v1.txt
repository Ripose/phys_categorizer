The internal vortex structure of a trapped spin-1 Bose-
Einstein condensate is investigated.
It is shown that it has
a variety of conﬁgurations depending on, in particular, the
ratio of the relevant scattering lengths and the total magneti-
zation.
PACS number: 03.75Fi

Recently the MIT group has succeeded in obtaining
Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC) of 23Na atoms in
an optical trap. [1,2] A novel aspect of this system is
that 23Na atoms possess a hyperﬁne spin, with f = 1
in the lower multiplet. All three possible projections of
the hyperﬁne spin can be optically trapped simultane-
ously. Thus generally the condensate have to be described
by a spin-1 order parameter consisting of the spinor
(Ψu, Ψ0, Ψd) where Ψu,0,d are the macroscopic wavefunc-
tions with the hyperﬁne projection s = 1, 0, −1 respec-
tively. The ground state of the condensate is determined
by the spin-dependence of the interaction between the
bosons. [3,4] In the dilute limit they can be characterized
by the (s-wave) scattering lengths a0 and a2 in the total
(hyperﬁne-)spin 0 and 2 channels respectively. The po-
lar state, where the order parameter is proportional to
the spinor (0, 1, 0), is favored if a2 > a0, but the axial
state, where the spinor is (1, 0, 0), if the inequality is oth-
erwise. 23Na belongs to the former case. However, 87Rb
is predicted to belong to the latter case. [3]

A particular interesting feature of these systems is that,
due to the weak spin dependence of the interatomic in-
teraction, a0 ≈ a2. For example for 23Na a0 ≈ 46aB and
a2 ≈ 52aB, where aB is the Bohr radius. Thus the dif-
ference a2 − a0 ≈ 6aB is only a small fraction of a0 or a2.
As a result, the condensate only needs to pay very little
extra energy to get into the “wrong” state. If there is a
competing energy, such as that due to the presence of a
gradient, it may be energetically favorable for the conden-
sate to deviate locally from the polar state. An analogous
remark is also applicable to 87Rb, where a0 ≈ 110aB and
a2 ≈ 107aB. [5]

In this paper I shall illustrate this by considering vor-
tices of this spin-1 Bose condensate. Vortices with a
scalar order parameter in BEC has been discussed in
In a cylindrically symmet-
many papers (e.g [6,7] ).
ric trap, there is no stable state for angular momentum
L < N ¯h where N is the number of particles. A singly
quantized vortex has L = N ¯h, with the position where
the order parameter is singular located at the center of
the trap. Here I shall show that vortices in a spinor con-
densate is even more interesting in that they exhibit a

very rich internal structure.
In general locally the or-
der parameter is in neither the polar nor the axial state.
They may have broken cylindrical symmetry with vor-
tices of individual species appearing at positions other
than the trap center. The minimum angular momentum
required for the formation of the vortex is also less than
N . Moreover transitions between diﬀerent internal vor-
tex structures are possible. Vortices were also discussed
in Ref [3] and [4], but they did not consider structures
which arise from deviations of the order parameter from
the original polar or axial phases.

Since the order parameter has more than one compo-
nent, it is convenient to distinguish between vortices of
individual order parameter component Ψs and the com-
posite structure. I shall refer the latter as the composite
vortex (CV).

The order parameter, in particular that of the CV,
is found by minimization of the energy (restricting our-
selves to T = 0) under appropriate constraints. The en-
ergy density E consists of the kinetic and potential con-
+ V |Ψs|2, where Ma is the atomic
tributions Ps
mass, V is the trap potential and the sum is over all spin
components, and the interaction part which can be writ-
ten as Eint = 1
2 c2|2ΨuΨd − Ψ0|2 where
n = Ps |Ψs|2 is the local density. Here c0 ≡ g0+2g2
and c2 ≡ g2−g0
where g0,2 are in turn related to the
scattering lengths in the total spin 0 and 2 channels via
g0,2 = 4π¯h
. [3] The total particle number N , angular
momentum L and magnetization M should be considered
as conserved if no exchange of the corresponding quantity
is allowed between the atoms inside the trap and their en-
vironment (within the relevant experimental time scale).
In this case we have to minimize the total energy for given
N , L and M . As usual it is convenient to introduce and
minimize the free energy G ≡ E − µN − ΩL − HM where
µ, Ω and H are Lagrange multipliers. µ, Ω, H correspond
to the chemical potential, angular velocity and magnetic
ﬁeld. Ω is given by the angular velocity of the rotating
trap if angular momentum can be exchanged between the
trapped atoms and their environment.

It is useful to note that the energy is invariant under
relative rotation between the real and spin space. Accord-
ingly in below the spin quantization axis will be chosen
for the most convenient presentation (and always along
the total magnetization if it is ﬁnite). In particular the
conﬁgurations presented below do not rely on any special
relative orientation between the net magnetization and
the rotational axis (which is always chosen as z). Since
the rotational properties of magnetization is intuitively

1

much simplier than that of a spin-1 wavefunction, I shall
also discuss the local magnetization density ~m. The pro-
jection of ~m along a general direction is measureable in
BEC experiments since it is given by the diﬀerence in the
number density between the u and d species when one
uses that direction as the quantization axis.

Setting the variation of the free energy with respect
to Ψ∗
s to zero, one obtains the familiar Gross-Pitaevskii
(GP) equations (generalized due to the presence of mul-
tiple spin species [3,4]).
If c2 > 0 such as in the case
of 23Na, in the absence of a net magnetization the or-
der parameter can be chosen so that only Ψ0 is ﬁnite
and obeys the GP equation in the usual form: 0 =
(− ¯h
∇2 + V − µ)Ψ0 +c0|Ψ0|2Ψ0. The order param-
eter proﬁle for Ψ0 would then be completely analogous
to that of a scalar order parameter with the interaction
parameter given by c0 (note then Ψ0 is independent of c2
). In particular in the absence of any circulation and if
one ignores the gradient term, ( the Thomas Fermi (TF)
approximation [8]) |Ψ0|2 = µ−V
c0 θ(µ − V ). The structure
of a singly quantized vortex would also be exactly analo-
gous to that of a scalar order parameter investigated by,
e.g., Dodd et al [6]. For the discussions below it is also
convenient to re-consider the same CV with quantization
axis rotated by π/2 about a horizontal axis. In this basis
the above CV becomes two coinciding vortices of the u
and d components with |Ψu| = |Ψd| and with the vortices
at the trap center. We shall see below that in general the
CV is very diﬀerent from the ones just discussed.

Typically in the experiments the cloud is trapped by
a potential harmonic in all three spatial directions. For
numerical simplicity I shall instead consider a cloud sub-
ject to a harmonic potential only in the x− y plane but of
uniform density within thickness d along the rotational
z axis.
It is reasonable to assume that the results be-
low will be qualitatively applicable to a pancake shaped
cloud trapped by a three dimensional, axially symmetric
harmonic potential if the radii of the clouds perpendic-
ular to the rotational axis are comparable. Rather than
varying µ and Ω to obtain a ﬁxed total number of par-
ticles and angular momentum, I shall simply present the
types of CV for ﬁxed µ’s and Ω’s. However, I shall con-
tinue to use the total magnetization (rather than H) as
an independent variable [2]. I shall eliminate µ in favor
of R ≡ (2µ/Maω2
o)1/2, where ωo is the (angular) trap fre-
quency. In the absence of vortices and under the TF ap-
proximation, the radius of the cloud and the total number
of particles are independent of the value of c2 and given
by R and No = d
)4 respectively, where λ0 is the
size of the harmonic oscillator ground state wavefunction
(λo = (¯h/Maωo)1/2). Here a ≡ (a0+2a2)
is an eﬀective
scattering length for the interaction parameter c0. All
the CV presented below has N ≈ No. [9]

I shall introduce the parameter ǫ ≡ (λ0/R)2 which
measures the deviation from the TF (ǫ → 0) limit.

depends only weakly on N for given trap parameters. I

shall express Ψs in units of pµ/co (correspondingly the
number density n and the magnetization density ~m in
µ/co) distances in units of R, and total particle num-
ber and magnetization mtot in units of No. With this,
all physical results depend only on the dimensionless pa-
rameters ǫ, ˜Ω ≡ Ω/ωo, ˜c2 ≡ c2/co and mtot. Anticipating
future experiments on other atoms I will not ﬁx ˜c2 to that
of 23Na (though conﬁning myself to ˜c2 > 0 ). As a con-
crete example I shall consider mainly ǫ = 0.1, ˜Ω = 0.45,
[10] with the corresponding phase diagram shown in Fig.
1. I shall comment on other values of the parameters as
I proceed.

We begin by considering mtot = 0. I shall present the
CV in two ways, each related to some of the CV struc-
tures discussed for mtot 6= 0 below. The structure of the
CV with quantization axis chosen so that it resembles
most closely a vortex of Ψ0 alone is as shown in Fig. 2.
However, instead of an empty core, it is energetically fa-
vorable for some of the 0 particles to convert to u and d
species and appear near the center of the trap. For the
present parameters, |Ψu| = |Ψd| and each has two vor-
tices. In Fig 2 the order parameter along the line (chosen
as the x axis) going through these vortices was shown.
Note that the CV has broken cylindrical symmetry.

Another useful way of presenting the above CV is to
use quantization axis rotated by π/2 about a horizontal
axis with respect to those above. In this basis only Ψu
and Ψd are ﬁnite, and both have a unit circulation with
the Ψu and Ψd vortices displaced by equal but opposite
distance from the trap center (Fig 3). It follows that the
local magnetization density is ﬁnite and points along the
(present) ˆz-axis, being negative for x < 0 and positive for
x > 0. Notice that at the vortex for say the d-component,
since |Ψd| = 0 and |Ψu| 6= 0, locally the condensate is
actually in the axial but not polar state (even though
mtot and H are zero)

With the use of this quantization axis we can also un-
derstand easily the reason for the present CV structure.
Due to the presence of the trap potential a vortex has
maximum kinetic energy if it is located at the center of
the trap. It is energetically favorable to move the u and d
vortices away from the trap center. [6,7] For the system to
be at an energy minimum, the u and d vortices move op-
posite to each other, creating regions where |Ψu| 6= |Ψd|,
eventually balanced by the desire of the condensate to re-
main in the polar state. In this picture it is obvious that
L/N < 1. As Ω increases, the Ψu,d vortices move closer
[e.g., for
to the center of the trap and L/N increases.
˜c2 = 0.2, L/N = 0.87(0.92) at ˜Ω = 0.45(0.5)]. The sep-
aration between the vortices, and the region where the
local magnetization is non-zero, increases with decreas-
ing ˜c2 [correspondingly L/N decreases: e.g., at ˜Ω = 0.45,
L/N = 0.84(0.80) for ˜c2 = 0.1(0.05)]

Now we are ready to consider the structure of the CV
with ﬁnite total magnetization. I shall describe each re-
gion of the phase diagram Fig. 1 in turn.

I: In this region the favorable conﬁguration is similar

2

the number of spin-up (relative to spin-down) particles
(see Fig 7) This conﬁguration is stable so long as the
total magnetization is close to that of the ‘spontaneous’
one, i.e. the topology of the CV remains the same ex-
cept for a re-adjustment of the amplitudes of Ψ’s. The
corresponding local magnetization density is as shown in
Fig 8. The direction of ~m thus rotates from −ˆx through
ˆz to ˆx as one moves along the physical x-axis. The ex-
istence of this spontaneous mtot means more of the local
order parameter is axial like, and thus this state is possi-
ble only for suﬃciently small ˜c2 Upon further increase in
mtot, this conﬁguration gives way to that of a u-vortex
and a d core (Fig 4), which has a larger susceptibility,
discussed earlier.

In conclusion I have shown that the internal vortex
structure of a spin-1 Bose condensate in a harmonic trap
is much richer than that of a condensate with a scalar
order parameter. Observation of these objects would be
interesting indeed.

to that of Fig 3 except for an increase (decrease) in the
amplitude of Ψu and Ψd (not shown). The local and to-
tal magnetization of this CV are always collinear. One
can understand this conﬁguration by considering the en-
ergy under the magnetic ﬁeld H. The CV has an order
parameter and hence a magnetic susceptibility which is
anisotropic. For a given magnitude of the magnetization,
the energy is minimum if the direction of ~mtot is along
that of largest susceptibility. The quantization axes used
in Fig 2 and 3 above correspond to the principal direc-
tions of the susceptibility tensor.
It is intuitively rea-
sonable that the CV has larger susceptibility along the
quantization axis of Fig 3 (c.f. [4]).

II: For larger mtot the vortex of the minority species
d disappears. The CV is replaced by a vortex of the u
species with a d core. ( Fig. 4.) This can be understood
by recognizing that the eﬀective chemical potential for
the d species is given by µ − H. Increasing mtot requires
increasing H, hence decreasing µ − H. Eventually the
eﬀective chemical potential is too low to overcome the
necessary kinetic energy required for forming a circulating
d component. This picture is supported by the fact that
the critical mtot needed for the I → II transition increases
with Ω. The −ΩL term in the free energy favors an order
parameter with ﬁnite circulation, thus at higher angular
velocity a larger H and hence mtot is required for the
[e.g, at ˜c2 = 0.2, the critical mtot ≈ 0.2 for
transition.
˜Ω = 0.45 here (Fig 1) whereas mtot ≈ 0.4 for ˜Ω = 0.5]

III: This occurs at still larger mtot and only for small
c2.
In this region the CV has a u vortex with a core
ﬁlled by the 0 species (Fig 5) The minimum magnitude
of mtot needed for this new CV increases with ˜c2. These
features can be understood by considering again the ef-
fective chemical potential for the 0 and d spins which are
µ and µ − H respectively. The spin 0 species is more
favored by H, but suﬀers a stronger repulsion (than the
d species) from the majority u species due to the spin
dependent interaction c2(> 0). Only at suﬃciently small
c2 and large mtot does this CV become favorable.

In Fig. 6 we display the local magnetization density
~m of this CV at points on the x axis, deﬁned so that
the phase diﬀerence between the u and 0 components
vanishes for x > 0. Near the trap center ~m points mainly
along the horizontal, turning towards ˆz, the direction of
net magnetization, only further away. The magnitude as
well as the z-component of ~m depends only on the radial
distance from the center of the trap. The azimuthal angle
of ~m is the negative of that of the corresponding physical
point in space. It is interesting to note that the presence
of the CV may actually not be apparent if one examines
only the particle number density n, in strong contrast to
the case of a scalar condensate. [6].

IV: This is the most intriguing region. At very small
˜c2 (and not too small ǫ’s) the CV has spontaneous (spin)
symmetry breaking in the sense that it has a net magneti-
zation even when H = 0. The conﬁguration evolves from
that of Fig. 2 by the creation of an imbalance between

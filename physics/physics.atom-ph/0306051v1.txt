Abstract

We have probed the fragmentation dynamics in a bent triatomic molecule, wa-
ter, a non-planar molecule, methanol, and a planar ring-structured molecule,
benzene, using 100 fs duration pulses of linearly and circularly polarized, in-
frared, intensity-selected laser light. At laser intensities larger than 1015 W
cm−2, the yield of singly and multiply charged atomic fragments from these
molecules is suppressed when the light is circularly polarized. At lower in-
tensities, the fragment ion yield is not signiﬁcantly polarization dependent.
This hitherto-unobserved intensity dependent eﬀect of the polarization state
of light on the fragmentation dynamics is rationalized using a simple electron
rescattering model. Circular polarization switches “oﬀ” electron rescattering
and leads to suppression of multiple ionization and molecular fragmentation.
Moreover, the degree of suppression is dependent upon the amount of energy
transfer from the optical ﬁeld to the molecule: the larger the energy transfer
that is required for a particular fragmentation channel, the more marked is
its suppression when circular polarization is used.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ready availability of intense, pulsed infrared radiation from ultrafast lasers has opened
new vistas for probing the nonlinear dynamics of atomic and molecular interactions in strong
optical ﬁelds. Field-induced ionization of atoms and molecules is a foregone conclusion
in such interactions. A special feature of strong-ﬁeld ionization dynamics is that ionized
electrons continue to “feel” the eﬀect of the optical ﬁeld. The wavepacket that describes the
ejected electron initially moves away from the vicinity of the parent. In the case of optical
ﬁelds that are linearly polarized, the electronic wavepacket is pulled back towards the parent
half a cycle after it was initially formed. The probability of recollision between the electron
and the parent depends on the laser phase, and also the initial velocity and initial position
of the electronic wave packet. Such rescattering allows the nuclear wavepacket to be probed
with time resolutions that are lower than the pulse duration aﬀorded by the laser that
is used. The correlation between the electronic and nuclear wavepackets that are created
in the ionization event has, recently, been utilized to probe the motion of the vibrational
wavepacket of D+
2 over several femtoseconds with unprecedented temporal accuracy of 200
attoseconds and spatial accuracy of 0.05 ˚A [1]. Rescattering also aﬀords other tangible
beneﬁts in that, in the case of atomic ionization, it gives rise to high harmonic emission [2,3],
generation of energetic electrons [4], multiple ionization [5] and attosecond pulse generation
[6,7]. The eﬀect of rescattering on diatomics like H2 and D2 has been probed [1,8] but its
eﬀect on the ionization dynamics is more diﬃcult to discern because double ionization of
such molecules occurs more readily through another strong-ﬁeld process, enhanced ionization
[9,10]. Recently, an intense-ﬁeld, many-body S-matrix theory has been developed [11] that
explicitly takes cognizance of electron wavepacket dynamics in determining ionization yields
in polyatomic molecules. However, to the best of our knowledge, the eﬀect of rescattering on
ionization and fragmentation dynamics in molecules other than H2 and D2 has, hitherto, not
been experimentally probed in systematic fashion. We report here results of experiments
on the fragmentation dynamics of some polyatomic molecules using linearly and circularly
polarized, femtosecond-duration, infrared, intensity-selected laser pulses of intensities that
are large enough to generate electric ﬁelds of magnitudes that are comparable with the
interatomic Coulombic ﬁelds. In the present study, we speciﬁcally explore the fragmentation
dynamics in three types of molecules by utilizing the polarization properties of intense laser
light over a range of peak intensities from 8×1014 to 1016 W cm−2. We have selected the
molecular targets to typify a bent equilibrium geometry (water), a non-planar polyatomic
(methanol) and a planar ring-structured polyatomic (benzene).

In going from linear to elliptically polarized light, it might be expected that the dynamics
of the ﬁeld-molecule interaction are inﬂuenced by one or more of the following factors:
a) The trajectory of the electron (or electrons) ejected upon ﬁeld-induced ionization (or
multiple ionization); b) At the same laser intensity, the electric ﬁeld amplitude is diﬀerent
for circular and linear polarization; and c) Angular momentum selection rules depend upon
the polarization state of light. These factors manifest themselves, in the case of atoms,
in changes in the ionization rate, changes in the energies of the ejected electrons, and on
In case of molecules, however, additional facets of the ﬁeld-
their angular distributions.
molecule interaction need to be considered, such as: (i) The polarization tensors in the
molecule that might lead to alignment, speciﬁcally in the case of linear polarization; (ii) The

2

dependence of the ionization rate on the angle between the induced dipole in the molecule
and the electric ﬁeld of the incident light; (iii) The rovibrational couplings in the electronic
states that inﬂuence interatomic distances; (iv) The eﬀect of enhanced ionization; and (v)
Diﬀerences in the quantal descriptions of the electronic states that are excited, owing to the
diﬀerent angular momentum selection rules. All these parameters make for the diﬃculty of,
and interest in the problem of understanding polarization-dependent molecular dynamics in
intense light ﬁelds.

While controversies persist in theoretical formulations as to whether, and to what ex-
tent, the polarization state of the incident laser radiation might inﬂuence atomic ionization
[12–15], experimental data with picosecond pulses appear to indicate that in both the intense
(1013 W cm−2) and super-intense (>1015 W cm−2) regimes, atomic ionization rates decrease
with the ellipticity of the incident light. For instance, experiments on above-threshold-
ionization have clearly shown that the ionization rate decreases with increase in ellipticity,
and this has been rationalized by simple semi-classical formulations [16–18]. In the tunnel
ionization regime, multielectron dissociative ionization of N2 has been studied by 100-fs-long
laser pulses of intensity in the 1015 W cm−2 range, using linearly and circularly polarized
infra-red light [19,20]. Substantial suppression of ionization channels has been observed in
the case of circularly polarized light, even when laser intensities were appropriately adjusted
to ensure that the laser ﬁeld experienced by N2 was identical in the two cases. Interest-
ingly, the enhanced ionization mechanism was shown to be valid for multiple ionization of
N2 with circularly polarized light [19]. Circularly polarized laser light, of intensity in the
range 1013-1015 W cm−2, has also been recently shown to lead to a reduced propensity for
ionization of a chiral molecule [21] in the picosecond regime. On the other hand, it has also
been reported that the fragmentation pattern of molecules is not largely inﬂuenced by the
laser polarization: Talebpour et al. [22] have recently shown that for intensities up to 1015 W
cm−2 using femtosecond duration pulses, the fragmentation pattern in benzene, and relative
ratios of fragment ion yields, are essentially similar for linear and circular polarization.

The dynamics of fragmentation of a molecule in intense ﬁelds can be perceived to occur
in two steps. Firstly, the intense laser ﬁeld ionizes the molecule. The ionization mechanism
could be multiphoton ionization, tunnel ionization or over-the-barrier ionization, depending
on the intensity of the interacting laser ﬁeld. Secondly, the molecular ion, either singly- or
multiply-charged, dissociates on the repulsive molecular ion potential energy surface, giving
rise to energetic fragment ions. Before the molecular ion rolls down the excited potential
surface, rescattering of electrons that are ionized but undergo oscillation under the inﬂuence
of the intense laser ﬁeld signiﬁcantly aﬀects the fragmentation of the molecules.
Is this
rescattering process more signiﬁcant for larger polyatomics, like benzene?

Quantitative, theoretical analysis of each of these steps, and prediction of their relative
importance with change of laser intensity and molecular properties such as size, is not pos-
sible. In our study of fragment ion yields obtained upon irradiation of water, methanol, and
benzene by intensity-selected laser ﬁelds, we ﬁnd that at intensities larger than 1×1015 W
cm−2, the ionization yields of all the atomic fragment ions, and of the single and multiply
charged molecular ions, are smaller with circularly polarized light than with linearly polar-
ized light. We have chosen to concentrate only on atomic fragment ions that are produced
in the interaction for the following reason. In the intensity regime that we probe, reliable
comparison of molecular ion yields is very diﬃcult as ionization occurs well in the saturation

3

regime. Atomic fragment ions are more convenient probes in this respect as, for example,
C3+ from benzene is observed only for intensities greater that 1×1015 W cm−2, and satura-
tion occurs at intensities that are much higher. In comparison, molecular analogs like C6H+
6
3 would be well into the saturation regime even at 1014 W cm−2. The results of
and C3H+
our measurements also show that while fragment ion yields are more or less independent of
the polarization state of the laser at lower intensities, the situation alters for intensities in
excess of 1015 W cm−2. Here, the fragment ion yields are signiﬁcantly lower for circularly
polarized light. We rationalize these observations in terms of a simple electron rescattering
model and suggest a propensity rule that gives some insight into the importance of electron
rescattering in the fragmentation dynamics of molecular systems.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Our experimental apparatus and methodology have been described recently [23] and only
those features that are most pertinent to the present study are mentioned in the following.
Light pulses (of wavelength 806 nm) were obtained from a high-intensity, chirped pulse
ampliﬁcation, titanium-sapphire laser system operating at 10 Hz repetition rate. The laser
light was focused using a biconvex lens, of 15 cm focal length, in an ultra-high vacuum
chamber capable of being pumped down to a base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr. Our vacuum
chamber was ﬂooded with H2O, CH3OH, or C6H6 vapor (after degassing by means of several
freeze-pump-thaw cycles in a clean, greaseless vacuum line) such that typical operating
pressures were in the range of 6×10−8 Torr. Ions formed in the laser-molecule interaction
were electrostatically extracted into a two-ﬁeld, linear, time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer.
The polarization state of the light was varied by use of a half-wave (or quarter-wave) plate.
The extent of elliptical polarization is deﬁned by the ellipticity parameter, ǫ=(Ex/Ey); in
our experiments circular polarization implies an ǫ-value of 0.9-1.0.

Focal volume eﬀects play a very important role in determining the ionization pattern
observed using time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometers. By using an aperture in the extracting
plate of the TOF one can choose the extent of focal volume to be sampled, rather than
sample the entire Rayleigh range. For example, recently it has been shown with molecules
like N2 and CS2 [23] that intensity-selective and intensity-averaged TOF spectra diﬀer from
each other, since diﬀerent intensity regions are “seen” by the TOF spectrometer due to the
spatial variation in intensity over the focal volume. Intensity-selected measurements are very
important for the intensity regimes that we are probing so that the large ion counts from
the low intensity region that could swamp the detector are avoided. We have conducted the
present experiments in intensity-selective mode by placing an aperture of 5 mm in front of our
TOF spectrometer. However to ensure that the collection eﬃciencies are not compromised,
we applied very high extraction voltages such that the extraction ﬁelds were ≥250 V cm−1;
measurements of the fragment ion yield as a function of the extraction voltage were made
to ensure unit collection eﬃciency, even for energetic atomic fragments like C3+.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

From an extensive set of mass spectrometric data on the interaction of intense light with
water, methanol and benzene molecules, we present in the following that subset of data that
pertains to the question: How does the polarization state of the intense laser radiation aﬀect
the fragmentation pattern when femtosecond pulses are used?

Figs. 1 and 2 show fragment ion yields obtained upon irradiation of H2O and CH3OH
at an intensity of 1016 W cm−2. We note that in both molecules, circular polarization
results in a distinct suppression of fragment ion yields. Fig. 3 shows corresponding data
for Cq+, q=1-3, fragment ions obtained from C6H6, and similar suppression with circular
polarization is observed. Earlier studies on benzene, carried out using nanosecond and
picosecond pulses, yielded overall fragmentation patterns that are similar to those observed
in the present femtosecond measurements, although there are some diﬀerences in relative
intensities (see [24,25], and references therein). The “ladder switching” mechanism, together
with its modiﬁcations [25], accounted for the fragmentation pattern in earlier long-pulse
experiments. However, in the present experiments, since the laser pulses are of only 100
fs duration, it might be expected that the ladder switching mechanism is not likely to be
applicable. Here, the fragmentation is likely to be induced by population of an electronic
excited state of the molecular ion that possesses a repulsive potential energy surface, at least
in the Franck-Condon region. The potential energy surface and its energy will, of course,
be distorted, in some indeterminate fashion by the intense laser ﬁeld. The fragment ions
that are formed will depend on the nature of the ﬁeld- distorted state and on the minimum
energy path in the multidimensional potential energy surface.

Conventional ladder switching mechanisms demand a large increase of unimolecular dis-
sociation rates with internal energy. Consequently, in the multiphoton ionization scenario,
the precursor ion dissociates before there is time for additional photons to be absorbed. This
is the rationale for the nonobservation of metastable multiply charged precursor molecular
ions in long pulse experiments. The ion pairs observed by Bhardwaj et al. [24] in picosecond
experiments invariably had atomic ions, C+ or C2+, as one of the constituents. In contrast,
the present experiments yielded strong signals corresponding to long-lived molecular ions
C6H2+
in addition to atomic ions like C+ and C2+. We found that the propen-
sity for producing multiply charged molecular ions was also distinctly lower with circularly
polarized light as compared to that with linearly polarized light for intensities in excess of
1015 W cm−2.

Our results on benzene apparently diﬀer from those of Talebpour et al. [22], who mea-
sured identical ion yields for both linear and circular polarization, also in the femtosecond
regime. But, we note that the two sets of measurements were conducted at diﬀerent laser
intensities. Moreover, it is not clear whether Talebpour et al. employed an intensity-selective
technique in their experiments. Absence of this would imply that their TOF spectrometer
would access a wide intensity range covering 1012-1014 W cm−2, with an enhanced propen-
sity of ion collection from the lowest intensity regions within the focal volume. To probe
the apparent diﬀerences further, we have made ion yield measurement for diﬀerent laser
intensities. Table 1 shows the relative ion yields for Cq+ fragments at diﬀerent intensities:
the yields are nearly same for intensities <1015 W cm−2, a value that corresponds to the
maximum intensity used by Talebpour et al.. At this, and lower, intensities we ﬁnd that

5

there is virtually no polarization dependence in the fragmentation pattern, in accord with
the ﬁndings of Talebpour et al.. However, at even a slightly enhanced intensity (such as a
peak intensity value of 2×1015 W cm−2), the fragmentation is found to become marginally
lower in the case of circularly polarized light. The degree of suppression becomes much more
pronounced as the laser intensity is increased.

So, how does one account for the hitherto-unsuspected eﬀect of laser intensity on the
polarization dependence of molecular fragmentation. As noted earlier, for the very short
pulses used in these experiments, ladder switching is not applicable as one can safely assume
that the nuclear motion in all three molecules would be negligibly small over time periods
of the order of 100 fs. We invoke electron rescattering in order to qualitatively explain the
observed suppression in the fragment ion yield at higher laser intensities. As in the case of
multiple ionization in atoms, we assume fragmentation of the molecular ion to be dominantly
due to the rescattering of the ionized electrons in the presence of the laser ﬁeld. We invoke
the following chronology of events. Upon irradiation, the target molecule initially undergoes
tunnel ionization when the ﬁeld intensity is large enough. The ionized electron does not
totally “leave” the molecule, but interacts with it under the inﬂuence of both the Coulomb
force and the laser ﬁeld. At low values of laser ﬁeld (corresponding to I = 1014 W cm−2)
the Coulomb ﬁeld has a large inﬂuence in determining the motion of the wavepacket that
describes the ejected electron. On the other hand, at large ﬁelds (corresponding to I = 1016
W cm−2), the electric ﬁeld of the interacting laser becomes comparable in magnitude to the
Coulomb ﬁeld and, therefore, exerts a much larger inﬂuence on the electron trajectories.
To determine the inﬂuence of the interacting ﬁeld on the motion of the ejected electron
wavepacket, we made a model calculation for a hydrogen atom. We compute the electron
trajectory by numerically solving the classical equation of motions.

The equation of motion along the x-axis is

m

∂2x
∂t2 ~x =

eq
r2 ~x + e~E~x,

(1)

where e, m are the charge and mass of the electron, q is the charge on the molecular ion, r
denotes the distance of the electron from the ion and ~E is the laser ﬁeld. We numerically
solve the diﬀerential equations of motion along all the ~x ~y ~z directions iteratively, with a
time grid of 0.01 a.u.. Fig. 4 depicts classical electron trajectories that we have computed for
linear and circular polarization at two diﬀerent laser intensities. At an intensity of 1014 W
cm−2, the large Coulomb interaction ensures that electron trajectories for both polarization
states are very similar. This is depicted in the lower panel of Fig. 4. So, in the lower
intensity regime, if the fragmentation is due to the dissociation of the molecular ion due to
impact of rescattered electrons, the fragmentation yield would be expected to be more or
less independent of the ellipticity of the laser ﬁeld. At higher laser intensities, like 1016 W
cm−2, the optical ﬁeld becomes dominant, and the electron trajectories are very diﬀerent
for the two polarization states. While rescattering of the ejected electron is possible with
linearly polarized light, it is absent in the case of circularly polarized light. So, one would
expect the fragmentation channels that are due to rescattering to be switched oﬀ in the
latter case.

We note that at large intensity, the electron trajectories for linear polarized light depend
If the initial position of the ejected

6

electron lies on the y = 0 line (when ~E is parallel to the x-axis), then the electron would
be expected to take part in rescattering. As the initial value of y deviates from zero, the
electron rescattering probability becomes small.

So, for high laser intensities, the absence of rescattering in the case of circular polar-
ization reduces the extent of molecular fragmentation. It appears reasonable to attribute
the diﬀerences in fragmentation that are experimentally observed to be directly attributable
to the change in electron rescattering probability. Our model calculations are simple but
demonstrative. However, they pertain to an atomic target. This simplicity begs the question:
does molecular structure play a role in determining the overall strong ﬁeld fragmentation
dynamics?

In order to probe this, and to lay the groundwork for proper theoretical treatment, we
consider in Fig. 5 how the suppression of fragmentation depends the appearance energy
of fragment ions from speciﬁc parent molecules. The ion appearance energy is a measure
of the ionization energy of the given fragment, say C2+, plus the bond dissociation energy.
The latter accounts for molecular structure eﬀects and, hence, results in diﬀerent values of
appearance energy for C2+ from benzene and methanol precursors. The appearance energy
is, therefore, a measure of the amount of energy transfer from the optical ﬁeld to the molecule
that is necessary in order to produce a given fragment ion. Data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that
circular polarization (the switching “oﬀ” of electron rescattering) results in distinctly more
marked suppression of fragmentation channels that require the largest energy transfer.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have conducted experiments on intense-ﬁeld dissociative ionization of water,
methanol, and benzene vapor with linearly and circularly polarized laser light. We ob-
serve a distinct lowering of the propensity to produce multiply charged fragment ions from
all these molecules when circularly polarized light is used at laser intensities in excess of
1015 W cm−2. At peak laser intensities lower than this, light-induced fragmentation appears
to be more or less independent of the polarization state of the incident intense light. The
lowering of multiply charged fragment ion yields with circularly polarized light is attributed
to the lowered probability of the rescattered electrons inducing dissociative ionization.

Our data also indicates that molecular structure eﬀects are important in determining the
degree of suppression that can be achieved by changing the polarization state of the incident
laser radiation from linear to circular. Those fragmentation channels that require the largest
transfer of energy from the optical ﬁeld to the molecule are suppressed most markedly by
using circularly polarized light; the suppression is less marked for those channels that require
smaller amounts of energy transfer.

The present set of experiments have probed electron rescattering from molecules more
complex than diatomic species and have revealed new facets of strong-ﬁeld phenomena that
have hitherto not been considered. Both the intensity dependence of the suppression that
has been observed as well as dependence on energy transfer will have to be accounted for in
development of theoretical insights into molecular fragmentation dynamics in strong optical
ﬁelds.

Within the context of atomic ionization, Lambropoulos [26] pointed out, thirty years
ago, that the eﬀect of light polarization on the multiphoton ionization of atoms is related,

7

in a general sense, to the eﬀect of ﬁeld correlations [27] of multiphoton processes. Both
eﬀects arise from the fact that the vectors of the radiation ﬁeld aﬀect, in nonlinear fashion,
the transition amplitudes for multiphoton processes. The nonlinearity in the amplitude
of the radiation ﬁeld leads to ionization rates that depend on the correlation functions of
the ﬁeld, and not just on the absolute value of the ﬁeld amplitude. When the circular
polarization vector ǫx ± iǫy is inserted in the expression for the transition amplitude, cross
products of matrix elements involving the orthogonal components ǫx and ǫy occur, and these
lead to the dependence of the ionization rate on the polarization state of the incident light
ﬁeld. However, the dependence of polarization eﬀects upon the intensity of the applied light
ﬁeld that has been observed in our experiments on water, methanol, and benzene remains
unexplained within the framework of the prevailing wisdom that has been articulated above
in simple terms.

Within the framework of tunnel ionization, the ADK formalism [28] sheds some light
on how atomic ionization rates depend on the polarization state of the incident light. The
ADK theory predicts that the ratio of ionization rate for circular polarization (wcirc) to that
for linear polarization (wlin) is

wcirc/wlin = (πq3/En∗3)1/2,

(2)

where, as before, q represents the ionic charge state, E is the electric ﬁeld amplitude, and
n∗ is the eﬀective principle quantum number that is stipulated in the ADK formalism.
This expression predicts a suppression of ionization probabilities in the case when linearly
polarized light is replaced by circularly polarized light of the same ﬁeld strength. Moreover,
such suppression is expected to have a I −1/4 dependence on laser intensity. While our results
do not replicate the exact functional dependence on I, the suppression that is observed
by us is, at ﬁrst sight, accounted for within the ADK picture. Where the ADK picture
fails is in accounting for the apparent threshold of 1015 W cm−2 that we observe for such
suppression. The ADK picture cannot, of course, be expected to account for speciﬁcally
molecular eﬀects that we have discovered here, such as the dependence of suppression on
fragment ion appearance energy.

line) polarized light of intensity 1×1016 W cm−2. The position of the H-atom at the origin is
indicated by X. All distances are indicated in atomic units (a.u.). The vertical axis deﬁnes the
x-direction (see text) while the horizontal axis is the y-direction. The arrows indicate the classical
motion of the ejected electron. b) Electron trajectories for ionization of H by linearly (solid line)
and circularly (dotted line) polarized light of intensity 1×1014 W cm−2.

FIG. 5. Ratio of ion yields obtained with linearly and circularly polarized light for diﬀerent
fragment ions as a function of fragment ion appearance energy. The laser intensity was 1016 W
cm−2. The solid line is to guide the eye.

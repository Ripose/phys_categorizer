In a fundamental test of quantum mechanics, we have collected over 250 000 quantum jumps
from single trapped and cooled 88Sr+ ions, and have tested their statistics using a comprehensive
set of measures designed to detect non-random behavior. Furthermore, we analyze 238 000 quantum
jumps from two simultaneously conﬁned ions and ﬁnd that the number of apparently coincidental
transitions is as expected. Similarly, we observe 8400 spontaneous decays of two simultaneously
trapped ions and ﬁnd that the number of apparently coincidental decays agrees with expected
value. We ﬁnd no evidence for short- or long-term correlations in the intervals of the quantum
jumps or in the decay of the quantum states, in agreement with quantum theory.

A basic principle of quantum mechanics is that the re-
sult of any single measurement of a quantum mechanical
observable is not predictable. Testing this principle is
important, not only for basic science, but also for ap-
plications such as quantum random number generators
(QRNG’s) and potential quantum computers. Yet only
a few experiments have searched for non-random behav-
ior in long sequences of repeated quantum measurements.
In [1, 2], the randomness of the path of a single photon
after a beamsplitter was used to build QNRG’s. In [3],
the arrival times of decay products of unstable nuclei
were used to test the statistics of quantum decay. Al-
though both these systems rapidly give excellent statis-
tics, detector ineﬃciencies limit the conclusions that can
be drawn regarding the statistics of quantum mechan-
ics. Furthermore, both systems are insensitive to certain
types of non-random behavior: many-particle eﬀects in
a collection of nuclei can obscure potential non-random
behavior of single systems, and because beamsplitters are
always somewhat biased, those QRNG’s are designed to
be insensitive to consecutive runs of transmissions or re-
ﬂections.

Observing the times of quantum jumps in an atomic
V-system [4] avoids these problems because transitions
between atomic levels can be detected with near-unit ef-
ﬁciency using a single atom [5]. In a pioneering paper [6],
Erber examined 640 quantum jumps in a single 198Hg+
ion conﬁned in a Paul trap [8]. Ref. [7] later reported a
less extensive analysis on 10 000 quantum jumps. In this
Letter, we analyze 250 000 quantum jumps comprising

tion to the substantial increase in statistics over earlier
work, our analysis of the statistics is more detailed and
extensive. We also test for unexpected correlations be-
tween transition times of multiple ions in a trap. This
is a critical issue for quantum computation in ion traps
and other devices [9] because systematic behavior of a
quantum system could alter the results of logic gate op-
erations.

FIG. 1: Partial energy level diagram, transitions and lifetimes
in 88Sr+. We drive the 422-nm transition to Doppler cool and
detect the ions, and the 1092-nm transition to prevent optical
pumping into the D3/2 state. A laser of bandwidth < 10 kHz
drives the 674-nm transition to produce quantum jumps to
and from D5/2 states.

In our experiment, we conﬁne 88Sr+ ions in a linear
Paul trap [10] and simultaneously drive the transitions
shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows a sample of the measured
422-nm scattering rate as a function of time; it displays
the well-known characteristics of quantum jumps. An
ion rapidly scatters resonant 422-nm light when it is in
the S1/2 ↔ P1/2 ↔ D3/2 manifold, but not at all when
it is in one of the metastable D5/2 magnetic sub-levels.
The scattering rate changes abruptly whenever a 674-nm
photon is absorbed or emitted. According to quantum
theory, the exact times that these changes occur should
be unpredictable.

To test this assumption, we analyze ﬁfteen continu-
ous records of the number of 422-nm photons that scat-
ter from the ion and reach a photomultiplier tube in a
bin time tbin (typically a few ms). Each measurement
is followed by a 200 µs dead time. From each record we
obtain four series U = {u1, u2, u3, . . . , uN } of sequential
time intervals, deﬁned as follows. We label as “bright”
the series of intervals during which the ion continuously
scatters 422-nm light, and “dark” the series of intervals

during which the ion ﬂuorescence is continuously absent.
In addition we analyze the series of intervals between
successive emissions (“emission”) and absorptions (“ab-
sorption”) of a 674-nm photon.

We adjust the intensities of the laser beams to control
the rate of quantum jumps. The bright intervals are dis-
tributed exponentially, with time constants ranging from
67 to 202 ms. The distributions of the dark intervals
deviate from a purely exponential distribution, proba-
bly because of ﬂuctuations and drifts in the frequencies
and intensities of the 422-nm and 1092-nm light. These
distributions are better ﬁt to a double exponential distri-
bution, with the shorter time constant ranging from 32 to
162 msec and the longer time constant two or three times
these values. Our analysis shows no substantial diﬀerence
in the results of our statistical tests between records with
the largest deviations from a pure exponential distribu-
tion and those with the smallest. Also, the results from
dark and bright series are comparable. This indicates
the laser ﬂuctuations measurably contribute neither to
randomness nor correlations in the data.

Our search for short-term correlations between inter-
vals ui expands on the analysis of [6]. We ﬁrst represent
the data as shown in Fig. 3 [11]. These ﬁgures plot the

number of occurrences of pairs {ui, ui+1} = {p, q}. Non-
random behavior between pairs of intervals would appear
qualitatively as asymmetry about the diagonal axes of
the plots (ui = ui+1), or as striations or other features
in the plots. No such features are qualitatively obvious
in these graphs for any of the data records.

To quantitatively search for features in these plots, we
begin by computing the expected distributions of sums of
adjacent intervals Us = {u1 + u2, u3 + u4,
. . .}. This is
equal to the distribution of the data integrated along lines
perpendicular to the diagonals of Fig. 3. If the measured
distribution of the data set U is d(t), and if each interval
comes from the same distribution, then the distribution
of sums should be

ds (t) =

d (t′) d (t − t′) dt′.

0

As an example, in the ideal case that d(t) = (1/τ ) e−t/τ ,
the distribution of sums is ds(t) = (t/τ 2) e−t/τ .

We also analyze the second moment d(2)

s (t) of this dis-
tribution, which is derived from the sequence of sums of
adjacent pairs of the previous sequence U (2)
s = {u1 +u2 +
u3 + u4, u5 + u6 + u7 + u8, . . . }. If each adjacent element
of Us is derived from ds(t), then we expect

d(2)
s (t) =

ds (t′) ds (t − t′) dt′.

We do not analyze higher order distributions because the
statistics become too poor to give meaningful results.

Next we compute the expected distributions of diﬀer-
ences of adjacent intervals Ud = {u1 − u2, u3 − u4,
. . .}.
This is equal to the distribution of the data integrated
along lines parallel to the diagonals of Fig. 3. If all ui de-
rive from the same measured distribution d(t), then the
distribution of Ud is

dd(t) =

d (t′) d (|t| + t′) dt′.

The second moment d(2)

lated from the sequence of diﬀerences between adjacent
pairs of the previous distribution: U (2)
d = {u1 − u2 − u3 +
u4, u5 − u6 − u7 + u8, . . . }. If all elements of Ud derive

FIG. 3: Density plot of successive values of ui for bright
intervals and intervals between 674-nm photon emissions for
a single run. For the bright intervals, the maximum point
density is 200/(8 ms)2, and for the intervals between emissions
it is 30/(8 ms)2.

Again, we do not calculate higher order moments of this
distribution because of poor statistics.

For each of the ﬁfteen data ﬁles, we calculate χ2 for
the comparison of the distributions of the sums and dif-
ferences of intervals with those expected from equations

(1 - 4). Each comparison gives a normalized χ2 ≈ 1.
Because the ﬁles are intentionally taken under diﬀerent
conditions, the data sequences U have diﬀerent distribu-
tions d(t) and cannot be combined point-for-point. In-
stead, the value of χ2 for each ﬁle is combined and the
probability of a worse χ2 for the total number of points
analyzed is calculated. Table I shows the results of these
calculation for the above tests. That the probability of
greater χ2 is always greater than ∼ 10% indicates that
both adjacent intervals and pairs of adjacent intervals are
derived from the same random distribution.

The distributions of sums and diﬀerences of succes-
sive intervals can be insensitive to distributions that are
skewed about the diagonal axes of Fig. 3. To search for
such asymmetry, we calculate

times, we ﬁrst analyze the autocorrelation sequence
Cj = hui ui+ji, where the hi denotes the average over
the data set U . We expect that for j > 0, Cj is constant.
Figure 4 shows the average values of Cj for the four types
of intervals averaged over all the data ﬁles. It shows no
correlations for times up to 24 intervals.

Another indication of long-term correlations in the
data would be deviations from the expected numbers
of consecutively increasing or decreasing runs of ele-
ments of length m. As an example, the subsequence
{. . . , 3, 15, 11, 5, 7, . . .} contains a run down of three el-
ements. If the data set U has a total of N elements, the
number of runs up or down of length m is expected to
be [3, 6]

This equation assumes that no element in U is repeated.
However, we measure the interval times ui in integer mul-
tiples of the bin time tbin, so often a run can be ter-
minated by a repeated interval value. We account for
this binning eﬀect, and combine all of the data to ob-
tain the values of Nruns(m) shown in Fig. 5. Because
the Nruns(m) are not independent of each other, a χ2
test does not apply. However, each point in the ﬁgure is
within reasonable agreement with the expected values.

In another search for predictability of transition times,
we analyze 248 000 quantum jumps in two ions sepa-
rated by ≈ 20µm. We then count the number of times in
which both ions appear to change state during the same
bin time tbin. The instant one ion is observed to enter
or leave the D5/2 state should be uncorrelated with the
moment any other ion makes such a transition. Other ex-
periments have seen many more apparently simultaneous
transitions between ions than expected [13].

We search for events in which the number of detected
422-nm photons n422 in one bin time is less than a thresh-

old consistent with no ions ﬂuorescing, immediately fol-
lowed or preceded by a value of n422 that is greater than a
threshold consistent with two ions ﬂuorescing. The prob-
ability of such events is determined by the probability per
unit time for a single ion to change states, the average
422-nm photon scattering rate per ion, the two threshold
values and the bin time tbin. We also account for the
possibility of misinterpreting the scattering rate from a
single ion for that of two ions due to insuﬃcient resolu-
tion between the count rate distributions of one and two
ions. The total number of coincident transitions into the
D5/2 states is expected to be 308, and we measure 320.
Also, a total of 316 transitions out of the D5/2 states is
expected from our data, and we measure 313. In addi-
tion, we ﬁnd that the observed numbers agree with those
produced in Monte Carlo simulations of the data. This is
consistent with the ions acting independently, in contrast
to [13].

Finally, we analyze the spontaneous decay of simulta-
neously trapped ions. Other workers have seen no cor-
relation between the decays of two ions [14]. Yet some
have observed unexpectedly frequent decays of several
ions during the same observation time [12]. In our exper-
iment, a brief (≤ 0.2 s) saturating pulse of 674-nm light
excites the atoms to the D5/2 states while the 422-nm
light is absent. After the 674-nm light pulse, the 422-
nm light is returned and we monitor the 422-nm photon
scatter rate every tbin = 5 msec. We observe 8400 de-

4

cay processes that start with two ions in the D5/2 state
and ﬁnish with no ions in the D5/2 state. In total, 26
of these transition appear to occur during the same in-
tegration time tbin. From a measured decay rate of 410
msec in our system , we expect to see 24 (4) of these
processes. This, too, is consistent with the behavior of
the ions being random.

In addition, when we map the data onto a uniform
distribution, they pass several other statistical tests such
those in [6, 7]—these results will be presented in a later
publication. In future experiments we intend to improve
our sensitivity to possible correlations between interval
times by reducing the frequency and intensity noise of
the cooling lasers.

Although it is impossible to prove randomness, we have
seen no signs of non-random behavior over short and long
time scales after analyzing 250 000 quantum jumps in sin-
gle ions, 238 000 quantum jumps in two simultaneously
trapped ions, and 8400 spontaneous decays of two ions.
Processes in QRNG’s and quantum computers would use
fewer quantum interactions than those analyzed here. In
these contexts, the present sensitivity is suﬃcient to show
that measurements are not aﬀected by correlations due
to non-randomness of quantum mechanics.

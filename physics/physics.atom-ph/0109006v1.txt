The concentration of the oscillator strength near the high-energy side of the
transition array was ﬁrst established for the 4d94f N
4d104f N −1 photoexcitation
spectra from lanthanides [1]. When the 4f orbital is collapsed the most intensive
lines of these transitions form the so-called giant resonances [2]. The concentration
of the strongest transition lines manifests itself also from some characteristic emission
spectra. This regularity was noticed in the survey of experimental analysis of 3p53dN
→
3p63dN −1 transitions [3]. Such a tendency was demonstrated too by the calculations of
complex spectra for various Sm ions [4]. This eﬀect explains the appearance of narrow
continuum band in the emission of laser produced plasma from rare-earth elements
[5]. The shift to the high-energy side of some complex Auger spectra corresponding
1 nlN2
to transitions from the initial nlN1
conﬁguration was predicted and illustrated by
calculations for lanthanide atoms in [6].

2

Such eﬀect takes place for the conﬁgurations with two open shells with the same
principal quantum number, when the Coulomb exchange interaction mainly determines
the energy level spectrum. This interaction forms the upper and the lower groups of
levels, with very diﬀerent abilities to participate in the transitions. Due to the relation
between the position of level and the transition amplitude from this level [1, 7, 8],
the transitions from mainly the upper group of levels of initial conﬁguration manifest
themselves in the radiative or Auger spectra.

This enhancement of some transitions and near-forbiddenness of the other
transitions indicates the existence of an additional selection rule. The aim of this work
is the formulation of such a rule.

In the case of the conﬁguration with one vacancy nl4l+1n(l + 1)N2 it was suggested
[1] (and generalised for any conﬁguration with two open shells nlN1n(l + 1)N2 [7]) to
classify the energy levels in a way which preserves nl4l+1n(l + 1) parentage. Such basis
can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix of the main Coulomb exchange coeﬃcient
g1. The algebraic way to construct this basis by using a special operator A(10) was
proposed in [9]. Operator A(10) is deﬁned by:

A(10) =

˜b(l1s)†
h

×

(10)

a(l2s)†

i

(1)

where a(l2s)† is an electron creation operator with an orbital rank l2 and spin rank s,
b(l1s)† is a vacancy creation operator, equal to the electron annihilation operator a(l1s).
The last one becomes the irreducible tensor only when multiplied by a phase factor,
thus in (1) the following operator is used:

b(l1s)†
m1µ1 = (

1)l1+s−m1−µ1b(l1s)†

−m1−µ1 = (

1)l1+s−m1−µ1a(l1s)

−m1−µ1 .

We shall consider the conﬁgurations nlN1n(l + 1)N2 with two neighbouring shells,

shortly they are designated lN1

complete basis for a given conﬁguration may be built with the aid of operators A(Kκ)
having general ranks K and κ:

where p = p′ + 1 if the fractional parentage coeﬃcient (the last multiplier on the right-
hand side) for Kκ = 10 is non-zero, and remains p = p′ otherwise. The labelling of those
basis functions would generally require some other quantum numbers γ of a two-shell
system besides the number of 1P pairs p and the resultant LS. But only p is important
for the present work. This new basis was named the hole-particle (HP) basis [9]. It can
be chosen in such a way that for the conﬁguration l4l+2
its functions coincide with the
functions of a single open shell of the usual basis. The values of these coeﬃcients can
be calculated using the recurrency relations similar to those derived for the two-electron
coeﬃcients [10, 11, 12].

pure PH coupling only the transitions obeying the rule ∆p = p
idea of such selection rule was suggested in [13]. There were also attempts to explain
the preference of some transitions using the usual basis: it was indicated in [14, 4] that
the dipole transitions from 4d104f N mainly went to the states of 4d94f 1P 4f N (however,
all electrons of the same shell must be treated equivalently in this basis).

can be expressed by a scalar product of operator A(10) (1) and the other similar operator
creating a vacancy in n(l + 1)N2 or n3lN3
shell and a free electron [6]. Consequently, in
3
the HP basis the Auger transition amplitude is presented as the product of two matrix
elements; for the ﬁrst of them the selection rule with respect to the p quantum number
also applies.

The selection rule for the number of pairs will manifest itself in the emission spectra
if the HP basis describes the involved conﬁgurations well. The comparison of the
wavefunction expansions in the HP and in the usual basis was performed for the Rb IV
4p34d and Ba XII 4d84f [8] conﬁgurations as well as for K I 3p53d2 and Rb I 4p54d2

purities of the wave functions conﬁrm the conjecture that this basis suits well for the

only diagonal matrix elements; (ii) in the HP basis some matrix elements connecting
such conﬁguration with the other conﬁguration of the same complex vanish [8] (since
the corresponding operator as the Auger transition operator can be expressed by the
operator A(10) (1)).

forbidden by the indicated selection rule from the lower group of levels of excited
conﬁguration.
Their insigniﬁcant participation in the formation of spectrum is
illustrated by ﬁgure 1, in which the total line strenghts from the given levels of initial
conﬁguration to all levels of ﬁnal conﬁguration are presented for Co VII 3p53d4
→
3p63d3. The distribution of total line strengths diﬀers essentially if all states are
supposed to take equal part in the transitions (all levels participate in proportion to
their statistical weights). The suppression of transitions from lower levels is rather
strict.

The more signiﬁcant violations of the rule ∆p = 1 may be caused by correlation
eﬀects. However, as we have indicated above, some interconﬁguration matrix elements in
PH basis vanish, and it concerns fairly important mixing of conﬁguration nl4l+1n(l +1)N
with nl4l+2n(l + 1)N −2n(l + 2),too.

Therefore the suppression of low energy transitions and the enhancement of the
other transitions clearly manifest themselves in various experimental spectra. For

Let us consider brieﬂy how the concentration of intensive lines on the high energy
side of the spectrum and the suppression of other lines depend on the number of electrons
in the outer open shell. For this purpose we can use the shift of the average energy of

shell the concentration of intensive lines on the high energy side gradually diminishes
and they spread within a larger part of the interval of possible transition energies. The
similar variation of the spectra arising from the open 4d and 4p subshells takes place for
the Sm isonuclear sequence [4]. Consideration of the average energy of Auger transitions
(8) shows that the enhancement of high energy lines and suppression of low energy lines
are most pronounced at a small number of electrons in the outer shell [6].

Therefore the formulated selection rule with respect to the number of vacancy-
electron pairs can have a fairly wide application in the interpretation of various spectra.

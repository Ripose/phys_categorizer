Electric-dipole matrix elements for 6p−nd, n = 5, 6, 7 transitions in cesium are calculated using a
relativistic all-order method. The resulting matrix elements are used to evaluate 5d lifetimes and 6p
polarizabilities. The data are compared with experimental lifetime and polarizability measurements
made by diﬀerent groups. Domination of the 6p scalar polarizabilities by 5d − 6p dipole matrix
elements facilitates an exacting consistency check of 5d lifetime and 6p polarizability data. Values
of 5d − 6p matrix elements obtained from experimental 5d lifetime data are found to be inconsistent
with those inferred from 6p polarizabilities derived from experimental Stark shift data. Our ab initio
calculated 6p polarizabilities agree well with experimental determinations.

The understanding of the accuracy of ab initio calcu-
lations in cesium is vital for the analysis of the Cs parity
In 1999, moti-
nonconservation (PNC) experiment [1].
vated by a number of recent high-precision experiments,
Bennett and Wieman [2] reanalyzed the agreement of
theoretical calculations and experimental data for a num-
ber of Cs atomic properties and reduced the previous the-
oretical uncertainty in the PNC amplitude by a factor of
two. Utilizing measurements of the tensor transition po-
larizability, β, reported in same work, they demonstrated
a 2.5σ discrepancy between the value of the weak charge
QW predicted by the Standard Model and that derived
from the Cs PNC experiment. Although several papers
(for example, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]), have addressed this
disagreement since 1999, the issue of the accuracy of ab
initio calculations in Cs continues to be of interest.

In this work, we investigate the radiative properties
of Cs 6p − nd transitions. Although these do not bear
directly on PNC experiments done to date, they have
been the subject of careful experimental investigation,
and thus provide benchmarks for precise comparison of
theory and experiment. In particular, there exist two in-
dependent measurements of the lifetimes of the 5d states
[10, 11], which do not agree within their stated uncer-
tainties. There also exist several experimental determi-
nations of the 6p − 6s Stark shifts which allow to infer
the values of polarizabilities of the 6p states[12, 13, 14].
Here we show that ab initio theory can check the mu-
tual consistency of 5d lifetime and 6p polarizability data,
with an accuracy of about 1%. We ﬁnd the lifetime and
polarizability results to be inconsistent at this level. Our
calculations agree with the experimental values of 6p po-
larizabilities, but deviate from both determinations of
the 5d lifetimes. We suggest that further experiments
are desirable in order to clarify this issue. In addition,

understanding of the accuracy of the 5d state properties
in Cs is germane to the ongoing PNC experiment in iso-
electronic Ba+ [15], since the 5d state is directly involved
in this experiment.

In outline, our approach uses a relativistic all-order
method to calculate electric-dipole matrix elements for
Cs 6p − nd transitions for n = 5, 6, and 7. These are
used to evaluate 5d radiative lifetimes and 6p polarizabil-
ities (for the latter, we also include contributions from all
other relevant states). Our calculations of the 6p scalar
polarizabilities, which are in good agreement with exper-
iment, show that they are dominated by contributions
from 5d − 6p transitions. These are the only electric-
dipole transitions contributing to the 5d state lifetimes
(as we mention below, the 5d − 6s electric quadrupole
transition rates are negligibly small). Thus, it is possible
to check consistency between polarizability and lifetime
measurements by deriving 5d − 6p matrix elements from
5d lifetime measurements and substituting these values
into the 6p polarizability calculations. For either of the
two experimental lifetimes, [10, 11] this procedure yields
a result that disagrees with directly measured polariz-
abilities [12, 13, 14] by several standard deviations.

The particular all-order method used here is the lin-
earized coupled-cluster method which sums inﬁnite sets
of many-body perturbation theory terms. We refer the
reader to Refs. [16, 17, 18] for a detailed description of
the approach. The wave function of the valence electron

|0Ci represent DHF wave function of a closed core. In

i and ai are creation and annihilation op-
erators, respectively. The indices m, n, and r designate

The excitation coeﬃcients ρma, ρmv, ρmnab, and ρmnva
are used to calculate matrix elements, which can be ex-
pressed in the framework of the all-order method as lin-
ear or quadratic functions of the excitation coeﬃcients.
We restrict the expansion given by Eq. (1) to single and
double (SD) excitations, with partial inclusion of triple
excitations. The results obtained using the SD expan-
sion are referred to as SD data throughout the paper
and results obtained with partial addition of the triple
excitations are referred to as SDpT data. We also per-
formed third-order many-body perturbation theory cal-
culations, following Ref. [19], to better understand the
size of higher-order correlation corrections. Unless stated
otherwise, all results in this paper are expressed in the
familiar system of atomic units, a.u., in which unit values
are assigned to the elementary charge, e, the mass of the
electron, m, and the reduced Planck constant ¯h.

Table I lists the 5d − 6p reduced electric-dipole matrix
elements in Cs as calculated using the Dirac-Hartree-
Fock approximation (DHF), third-order perturbation
theory (III), single-double all-order method (SD), and
single-double all-order method including partial triple
contributions (SDpT). We use semi-empirical scaling de-
scribed, for example, in Ref. [17] to estimate some classes
of the omitted high-order corrections. The scaled values
are listed in rows labeled SDsc and SDpTsc.

We use the 5d − 6p matrix elements from Table I to
calculate the lifetimes of the 5d3/2 and 5d5/2 levels in Cs.

The results are listed in Table II. The experimental en-
ergies from [22] are used. The scaled SD values are taken
as ﬁnal values based on the comparison of a number of
Rb, Cs, and Fr results [23, 24] with experiment. The
theoretical values diﬀer substantially, by over 5%, from
the experimental results (we note that that the exper-
imental values from Refs. [10, 11] diﬀer by 4%, which
exceeds their stated uncertainties of 0.7% and 1%, re-
spectively). One possible source of such a discrepancy is
the contribution of the 5d − 6s electric-quadrupole tran-
sition to the 5d lifetime. Our calculation of this rate,
using the all-order method, yields a corresponding Ein-
stein A-coeﬃcient for the 5d5/2 − 6s transition of 19 Hz,
which is only 0.02% of the corresponding electric-dipole
A-coeﬃcient of 741 kHz (see Table II). Thus, the contri-
bution of the electric-quadrupole transition to 5d lifetime
is entirely negligible within the present experimental and
theoretical uncertainties.

To clarify such a large disagreement we check the con-
sistency of the experimental 5d lifetime measurements
with 6p polarizability measurements, which involves con-
tributions from the same transitions. First, we use ex-
perimental 5d lifetimes from [10] to determine the 5d−6p
reduced matrix elements. Inverting Eq. (3), we ﬁnd for
the 5d5/2 − 6p3/2 matrix element:

|h5d5/2kDk6p3/2i| = 9.916(35).

(4)

To derive the 5d3/2 − 6p1/2 and 5d3/2 − 6p3/2 matrix ele-
ment, the lifetime of the 5d3/2 level alone is not suﬃcient
and some assumption about the ratio R of these matrix
elements must be made. We use the theoretical SDsc
value 0.4512(18) from Table I for the ratio and assume
the deviation of other high-precision theoretical results
in Table I from this value to be its uncertainty. The vari-
ation of the ratio from one approximation to another is
far smaller than the variation in the individual matrix
elements, thus the uncertainty is rather low (0.4%). The
resulting values of the 5d3/2 − 6p matrix elements are:

|h5d3/2kDk6p1/2i| = 7.283(60),
|h5d3/2kDk6p3/2i| = 3.286(27)(13).

(5)

We separated the uncertainties in the 5d3/2−6p3/2 matrix
elements into contributions from the 5d3/2 lifetime mea-
surement (0.027) and from the estimation of R (0.013).

ical ratio of the 6p3/2 − 5d3/2 and 6p1/2 − 5d3/2 matrix elements.

where D is the dipole operator and formula for α0 in-
cludes only valence part of the polarizability. The main
contributions to the polarizability, αmain, come from
transitions between 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s, 6p, 7p, 8p, 9p, 5d,
6d, and 7d levels; the remainder, αtail,
is calculated
from summing over all other valence-excited states of
the system (which is conﬁned in a sphere of radius
75 a0). The core contribution to the scalar polarizability
αcore = 15.8 a3
0, is taken from [21], where it was cal-
culated in random-phase-approximation (RPA). We note
that this value includes the contribution from the valence
shell and, therefore, must be compensated by the addi-
tional term, αvc, which is equal to the contribution from
the valence shell divided by (2jv + 1) with an opposite
sign. We ﬁnd that the αvc term is negligible for np states
and very small (below 0.2%) for the 6s state. We list the
contributions to Cs 6p polarizabilities in Tables III and
IV. The corresponding electric-dipole matrix elements d,
their sources, and uncertainties δd are also given. The
values for 6s − np and 7s − np transitions are taken from
Ref. [6], where the “best value” set of these matrix ele-
ments was compiled for the calculation of the tensor tran-
sition polarizability β. The 6p − 6d and 6p − 7d matrix
elements are from the present ab initio SDpT calculation.
The values of the 5d − 6p matrix elements are derived
from the 5d lifetime experiment [10]. The same data set

is used in both tables. The uncertainties of all contri-
butions are listed separately. The uncertainties listed in
Ref. [6] are used for 6s − np and 7s − np transitions; the
diﬀerence between SD and SDpT data is taken to be the
uncertainty of the 6p − 6d and 6p − 7d matrix elements
calculated in this work. The uncertainties of the 5d − 6p
matrix elements obtained from the lifetime experiment
[10] are derived above. The uncertainty of the core term
αcore is taken to be 2% based on the comparison of RPA
data for closed core systems with experiments and high-
precision calculations. The uncertainty of the remaining
contribution αtail is estimated to be 30% based on the
comparison of the DHF results with correlated values.

We also calculate the scalar polarizability of the 6s
state using the same methods and data set as for the 6p
polarizability. The resulting value α0(6s) = 398.2(0.9) a3
0
and its uncertainty are dominated by contributions of
the 6s − 6p matrix element taken from experiment of
Ref. [20]. We use this result when calculating diﬀerences
of 6p and 6s polarizabilities. The recent measurement
of the ground state polarizability in Cs yielded the value
α0(6s) = 401.0(0.6) a3

0 [25].

We compare the ﬁnal results for the diﬀerences of
the 6p and 6s scalar polarizabilities α0 and the ten-
sor polarizability α2 with experiment in Table V. The
results of the above calculation (data from Table III,
IV), where we used 5d − 6p matrix elements derived
from the 5d lifetime experiment are listed in column
(a). We ﬁnd that the diﬀerence of the 6p3/2 and 6s
scalar polarizabilities which uses numbers for 5d − 6p
matrix elements derived from [10] 5d lifetime measure-
ments α0(6p3/2) − α0(6s) = 1322(18) a3
0 is inconsistent
with both experimental values 1240.2(24) a3
0 [13] and
1264(13) a3
0 [12]. The diﬀerence with ﬁrst value, which
has the smaller uncertainty is 4.5σ and the diﬀerence with
the second value is 2.6σ. The diﬀerence of the 6p1/2 and
6s scalar polarizabilities which uses numbers for 5d − 6p
matrix elements derived from [10] 5d lifetime measure-
ments α0(6p1/2) − α0(6s) = 1006(24) a3
0 is also inconsis-
tent with the most recent and most precise experimental

value 927.35(12) a3
0 [14] by 3.2σ. The value for the 6p3/2
tensor polarizability −267.3(4.7) a3
0 has much larger un-
certainty owing to strong cancellation of the contribu-
tions from diﬀerent transitions, and the diﬀerence is 1σ.
We note that if we were to use another 5d5/2 lifetime ex-
periment [11], the discrepancies with polarizability mea-
surements only increase. Thus, neither 5d5/2 lifetime ex-
periment [10, 11] is consistent with either [12], [13], or
[14] Stark shift measurements within the quoted uncer-
tainties.

Finally, we repeated the polarizability calculation by
replacing the 5d − 6p matrix elements derived from the
lifetime experiment by our theoretical values (SDsc) from
Table I. All other matrix elements and contributions are
exactly the same as in the ﬁrst calculation. The results
are listed in column (b) of Table V. As expected, they
are quite diﬀerent from the previous calculation (a) as
our theoretical 5d − 6p matrix elements are substantially
diﬀerent from the values derived from 5d lifetimes. We
ﬁnd that our theoretical polarizability data are in good
agreement (0.4%-1%) with experimental results.

In conclusion, we ﬁnd the experimental measurements
of 5d lifetime and 6p scalar polarizabilities to be inconsis-
tent within the uncertainties quoted by the experimental
groups. Our theoretical calculations are consistent with
polarizability experiments but not with the lifetime mea-
surements. Thus, further measurements of the properties
of 5d and 6p states are of great interest for clariﬁcation of

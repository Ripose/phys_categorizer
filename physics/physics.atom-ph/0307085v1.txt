The kinetic energy distribution of D+ ions resulting from the interaction of a femtosecond laser
pulse with D2 molecules is calculated based on the rescattering model. From analyzing the molecular
dynamics, it is shown that the recollision time between the ionized electron and the D+
2 ion can
be read from the D+ kinetic energy peaks to attosecond accuracy. We further suggest that more
precise reading of the clock can be achieved by using shorter fs laser pulses (about 15fs).

Human experience shows that new areas of science and
technology open up with the ability to make measure-
ments at increasingly shorter time regime. With the
advent of femtosecond (fs) lasers, femtochemistry be-
came possible where chemical reaction dynamics can be
probed at the atomic scale [1]. Clearly, fs lasers cannot
be used directly to probe electron dynamics which is in
the attosecond (as) regime. While a substantial eﬀort
is being dedicated to developing single attosecond pulses
[2, 3, 4, 5], presently few laboratories have such lasers
available.

An ingenious suggestion for performing measurements
at attosecond resolution with fs lasers was proposed by
Corkum and his group recently. Their results were re-
ported in two recent publications, here to be called I [6]
and II [7], respectively. In their experiment, a 40 fs pulse,
with mean wavelength ranging from 800 nm to 1850 nm,
and peak intensity of about 1.5 × 1014 W/cm2, was used
to ionize a D2 molecule to produce D+ ion. It was as-
sumed that D2 was ﬁrst ionized near the peak of the laser
pulse to create a correlated electronic and nuclear wave
packet. Within a single optical cycle, the electron was
driven back to collide with D+
2 and to excite it to the ex-
cited σu electronic state which subsequently dissociated
to produce D+. The kinetic energy of the D+ ion reﬂects
the internuclear distance, as well as the time when the
rescattering occurs. With proper laser intensity, both the
initial ionization and the rescattering are found to occur
at time interval of far less than one optical cycle, thus
providing attosecond temporal resolution, irrespective of
the femtosecond pulse duration of the laser.
In II, by
changing the wavelength of the fs laser, they concluded
that the dissociation dynamics of D+
2 can be used as a
molecular clock and the clock can be read with attosec-
ond resolution.

To read the molecular clock accurately, the rescatter-

ing mechanism which leads to the measurable D+ kinetic
energy distribution has to be understood in details. In
this Letter we report the main conclusion of our careful
analysis of the rescattering mechanism. In contradiction
to I and II, our analysis shows that the D+ ions are not
produced by the dissociation of the excited D+
2 ions. We
found that the excited D+
2 ions are readily further ionized
by the laser and thus the D+ ions measured in I and II
are mostly coming from the Coulomb explosion along the
D+ + D+ potential curve. Our conclusion is consistent
with the recent experiment of Alnaser et al. [8] where the
branching ratio of D+ produced from Coulomb explosion
vs. from dissociation was determined. Our analysis also
shows that the dominant peak of the D+ kinetic energy
distribution is from the third return of the rescattering
process, rather than from the ﬁrst return, as assumed in
I and II. This has the eﬀect that the previous molecular
clock was not read correctly. From our analysis we fur-
ther suggest that a more precise reading of the clock can
be achieved with a shorter fs pulse.

In Fig. 1 we depict the physical processes in the rescat-
tering mechanism which are used for reading a “molecu-
lar clock”. Similar to the experimental arrangement of I
and II, the D2 molecules are aligned perpendicular to the
direction of a linearly polarized infrared laser. This con-
ﬁguration eliminates D+ ions from being produced either
through bond softening or through charge resonance en-
hancement ionization [9, 10], even though both processes
produce D+ ions at lower kinetic energies which can be
separated from the higher energy ions produced through
the rescattering process [8] considered here. Following
Fig. 1, a D2 molecule is ionized near the peak ﬁeld of the
laser pulse at t0. This ionization launches two correlated
wave packets: an electronic wave packet which is driven
by the combined laser ﬁeld and the Coulomb ﬁeld of the
D+
2 ion, and a vibrational nuclear wave packet which is
assumed to propagate freely in the σg ground potential of
D+
2 . The vibrational wave packet at t0 is taken to be the
ground vibrational state of D2, assuming Frank-Condon

FIG. 1: Schematic of the major physical processes leading to
the formation of D+ ion. The D2 is ﬁrst ionized at t0 creating
an electron wavepacket which returns to collide with D+
2 at
time t1. In the meanwhile the initial vibrational wave packet,
measured by χ2(R,t), created at t0, is shifted to larger R and
broadened at later time. At t1, the D+
2 is excited from σg to
σu and πu by electron impact. The excited D+
2 can dissociate
directly to give D+, or can be further ionized at t’1, t’2, etc
to produce two D+ ions by Coulomb explosion. Note that
similar rescattering processes can be initiated at later time,
t2, t3, etc, and are included in the calculated D+ spectra.

2 at time t1. The rescattering can excite D+

principle. For t > t0, the vibrational wave packet propa-
gates outward and broadens, as shown in the top frame
of Fig. 1. The electron initially is driven out by the laser
ﬁeld but returns after 2/3 of an optical cycle to recollide
with D+
2 to
higher electronic states or to ionize it. To simplify the
operation of the clock, the laser intensity is chosen such
that the returning electron has small energy and ioniza-
tion is negligible. Once the D+
2 is in the excited electronic
state, it can dissociate or it can be further ionized by the
laser ﬁeld. Since the laser pulse lasts for many optical cy-
cles, the electron can revisit the D+
2 ion many cycles later
after the initial ionization. Thus rescattering can occur
on the second return at t2, on the third return at t3, etc,
see Fig. 1. For each initial t0, the return times t1, t2, t3,
... are fairly well deﬁned. Since the initial ionization at
t0 occurs only in a sub-fs time interval, the rescattering
times ti (i=1,2,3,...) are also deﬁned at the sub-fs (or
attosecond) accuracy. If the rescattering populates only
the lowest excited electronic state, σu, and then the D+
2

2

dissociates, the peaks of the kinetic energy released can
be used to read the clock at the rescattering times, as
depicted in Fig. 1.

We have examined the rescattering model in details
and found three major modiﬁcations to the simple model
used in I and II. First, we found that excitation to the ex-
cited πu electronic state is not negligible in general. Sec-
ond, once the D+
2 ions are in the excited electronic states,
they are readily ionized by the laser ﬁelds such that the
D+ ions are predominantly produced from the Coulomb
repulsion. This modiﬁes the D+ ion energy distributions.
Third, we found that rescattering from the third return
is more important than from the ﬁrst return, in disagree-
ment with the model of I and II. However, our conclusion
is identical to the rescattering model results of He where
multiple returns have been shown to be dominant [11].

In the modelling, we calculate the ionization rate at t0
using the molecular tunneling (MO-ADK) model for a D2
molecule aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization
[12]. The subsequent trajectory of the ionized electron is
calculated classically in the ﬁeld of D+
2 and the laser, with
initial longitudinal and transverse velocity distributions
determined according to the ADK theory. The return
energy and return time of the electron at the distance
of closest approach are calculated. To obtain electron
impact excitation probability from σg to the excited σu
and πu electronic states of D+
2 , we used scaling relation
similar to that used for He [11], taking the 1s to 2p ex-
citation cross section for electron impact on H and He+
as input data [13]. Since D+
2 is aligned perpendicular
to the electron beam direction, we use the 2p1 excitation
cross section for the σu state and the 2p0 excitation cross
section for the πu state, but each rescaled with their re-
spective excitation energies. It is interesting to note that
electron impact excitation to 2p0 is ﬁve to three times
larger than excitation to 2p1 in the energy region of in-
terest (the branching ratio for data from Bray [14] for H
and from the experimental data of [15] for He are essen-
tially identical). Thus, diﬀerent from I and II, we found
that excitation to πu state is not negligible. Once the D+
2
ions are in the excited electronic states, they can dissoci-
ate or further ionized by the laser. We use the MO-ADK
model [12] to calculate the ionization rate of D+
2 in the σu
and πu states, at diﬀerent internuclear separations and
for molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser polar-
ization. Since the electron cloud of the πu state for the
perpendicularly aligned D+
2 is along the laser ﬁeld direc-
tion, it is readily ionized. For the σu the ionization rates
are smaller but increase rapidly with laser intensity. Us-
ing the ionization rates which are large only near t
2,
... (see Fig. 1) following the excitation of D+
2 at t1, t2,
etc, we calculated the ionization and dissociation yield
and the D+ kinetic energy distributions. Since the vi-
brational wave packet spreads as time increases, we need
to weight the R-dependence at each time in calculating
the ionization and dissociation yields, as well as the cor-

responding energy of D+. In the simulation, we also have
to integrate t0 near the peak of the ﬁeld where ionization
of D2 was initiated.

Figure 2(a) shows the total D+ spectra obtained from
the present rescattering model. The total yield from
ionization and dissociation is shown in solid line. Note
that the dissociation alone, shown in dashed lines, con-
tributes little to the ion yield, except at lower energies.
In Fig. 2(b) we identify the dissociation and ionization
yields from rescattering at diﬀerent times. This is impor-
tant since it determines how precisely a molecular clock
can be read. In the ﬁgure we separate the contributions
into 1st and 2nd cycles. Each cycle is deﬁned to be one
full optical cycle after the electron is born. Thus the ion-
ization peak from the ﬁrst cycle measures D+ ion from
rescattering occurring near t1, while the ionization yield
from the second cycle is due to rescattering occurring
mostly at t2 and t3. Since the return energy at t2 is
smaller, contribution in the second cycle comes mostly
from rescattering at t3. From Fig. 2(b), the peak posi-

tion for the 3rd return in the ionization spectra essentially
coincides with the peak position from the ﬁrst return in
the dissociation spectra. This peak in the total D+ ion
spectra was identiﬁed in II as a reading of the clock at
t1, while our analysis shows that this should be a read-
ing of t3.
(Note that the spectra in Fig. 2(a) include
contributions from higher returns that are not shown in
Fig. 2(b).)

In Fig. 3(a) we show the calculated D+ spectra at four
diﬀerent wavelengths used in II. The data are to be com-
pared to their Fig. 2 except that we plot against the
sum energy which is twice the energy per D+ used in
II. The comparison shows reasonable agreement, but not
in details, since the modelling does not account for the
volume eﬀect and the ﬁnite acceptance angle used in the
experiment. However, the shift of the main peak with in-
creasing wavelength is clear. In Table I we compare the
data deduced from II with the data deduced from our
calculations shown in Fig. 3(a). The experimental peak
energy for each wavelength is shown in column 2. Assum-
ing that the peak is due to dissociation for rescattering
at t1, the expected kinetic energy, the mean internuclear

II, and are shown in the third column. According to our
model, the peak at each wavelength is due to rescattering
at t3, obtained from the ionization signal. The predicted
deuteron energies from our modelling , shown in the 4th
column, are in good agreement with the experimental
data. However, we read a diﬀerent mean internuclear
separation and a diﬀerent rescattering time. From this
Table, we note that these measurements imply a sub-
angstrom resolution in the internuclear separation or an
attosecond resolution in the recollision time.

In Fig. 3(a) the peak positions for the 1530 nm and
1850 nm data points are not very sharp. From Table
I we note that t3 for each case is 8.6 fs and 10.5 fs re-
spectively. At such long time after the wave packet is
created, the spreading of the vibrational wave packet is
large such that the clock can no longer be well read. In
fact, the peak energy and the mean internuclear separa-
tion for these two wavelengths are calculated from the
third return alone, not from the full spectra. Thus the
longer wavelength laser blurs the reading of the clock.

Another issue that aﬀects the reading of the clock is
the pulse duration. A clock designed to read t1 appears
preferable since the vibrational wave packet is not sig-
niﬁcantly broadened within one optical cycle. However,
at t1 the mean internuclear separation is small and the
molecular potential curves are steep. Upon reﬂection,
this results in a rather broad D+ kinetic energy spec-
trum, see the dissociation or ionization peaks from the
ﬁrst return in Fig. 2(b). Signals from the ﬁrst return
are also weak, and the structures are easily buried by
contributions from the third return. Indeed, our model
indicates that the kinetic energy spectra are dominated
by rescattering from the third return. Even though the
vibrational wave packet is broadened more at t3, the
breakup occurs at larger internuclear separations where
the potential curves are rather ﬂat, resulting in sharper
deuteron energy spectra, see Fig. 2(b). Unfortunately
for a 40 fs pulse used in I and II, higher returns ( for
t > t3) still contribute to the rescattering process. These

4

higher returns modify the ion yield in the lower energy
region, thus shifting the overall peak position. By us-
ing a shorter laser pulse, contributions from these higher
multiple returns can be eliminated. In Fig. 3(b) we show
the calculated ion yield for a 15 fs laser pulse at the same
intensity as in Fig. 3(a). Clearly the main peak in the
ion yield is more prominent and thus the time resolution
is improved. Note that the clock is not expected to be
aﬀected by the lack of knowledge of the absolute phase of
the few-cycle laser pulse since the clock is measured from
the time t0 where D2 is ﬁrst ionized. However, our anal-
ysis does not include volume eﬀect, nor the acceptance
angle of D+ ions, which can reduce the precision of the
molecular clock.

In summary, we examined the rescattering mechanism
for the production of high energy D+ ions in laser-D2
interaction. We show that the D+ ions are produced
mainly not from the dissociation of D+
2 after it is ex-
cited by the returning electron, but rather by Coulomb
explosion after the excited D+
2 is further ionized by the
laser. We agree with Niikura et al. [6, 7] that the ion
spectra can be used as a molecular clock with attosecond
precision, and suggest that experiments with a shorter fs
(about 15fs) laser pulse would improve the precision of
the clock.

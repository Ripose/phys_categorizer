Abstract

We demonstrate a way to circumvent the interruption of evaporative cooling

observed at high bias ﬁeld for 87Rb atoms trapped in the (F = 2, m = +2)

ground state. Our scheme uses a 3-frequencies-RF-knife achieved by mixing

two RF frequencies. This compensates part of the non linearity of the Zee-

man eﬀect, allowing us to achieve BEC where standard 1-frequency-RF-knife

evaporation method did not work. We are able to get eﬃcient evaporative

cooling, provided that the residual detuning between the transition and the

RF frequencies in our scheme is smaller than the power broadening of the RF

transitions at the end of the evaporation ramp.

Forced evaporative cooling of atoms in a magnetic trap is at the moment the only known

way to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation [1–3]. Particles with energy signiﬁcantly larger

than the average thermal energy are removed from the trap and the remaining ones thermal-

ize to a lower temperature by elastic collisions. For that, an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld is used

to induce a multi-photon transition from a trapping state to a non-trapping state via all

intermediate Zeeman sublevels. Atoms moving in the trap with suﬃcient energy can reach

the resonance point (RF knife) and exit the trap. If the RF-frequency is decreased slowly

enough, and no other process is hampering the forced-evaporation, the increase of the phase

1

space density obtained by this method eventually leads to Bose-Einstein condensation.

In a previous publication [4], we reported that RF forced evaporative cooling of 87Rb

atoms in the (F = 2, m = +2) ground state in a magnetic trap with a high bias ﬁeld is

hindered and eventually interrupted. Our interpretation of this phenomenon is based on

the non-linear terms of the Zeeman eﬀect that lift the degeneracy of transition frequencies

between adjacent Zeeman sublevels. This interpretation is supported by numerical calcula-

tions [5]. Interrupted evaporative cooling in a large magnetic ﬁeld is a serious problem in

several situations, interesting for practical reasons - like the use of permanent magnets [6]

or of an iron core electromagnet as the one described in [7]. High magnetic ﬁeld evapora-

tion is also important in connection with Feschbach resonances [8–11]. In this paper, we

demonstrate that it is possible to achieve eﬃcient evaporative cooling in a high magnetic

ﬁeld, by use of a multi-frequency RF knife allowing a multi-photon transition to take place

across non equidistant levels. We show that, for our range of magnetic ﬁelds, it is possible

to use a simple experimental scheme where the three required frequencies are obtained by

RF frequency mixing yielding a carrier and two sidebands.

Our high bias ﬁeld magnetic trap follows the Ioﬀe-Pritchard scheme. In this scheme, the

magnetic ﬁeld modulus has a 3D quadratic dependence allowing trapping, plus a bias ﬁeld

B0:

B = B0 +  G2

We focus in this paper on 87Rb in the F = 2 manifold of the electronic ground state. Atoms

are initially trapped in the m = +2 state. Our bias ﬁeld B0 is between 50 and 200 Gauss.

This is much larger than in most other experiments where B0 can be independently adjusted,

and is set typically at 1 Gauss [12]. In a large magnetic ﬁeld, the non linear terms are not

negligible in the Zeeman shifts given by the Breit-Rabi formula

Em(B) = mgIµnB +

with

.

Here gS ≃ 2.002 and gI ≃ 1 are respectively the Land´e factor for the electron and the

nucleus, µB and µn are the Bohr magneton and the nucleus magneton, and ωHF (2π × 6834.7

MHz) is the hyperﬁne splitting.

Compared to the low magnetic ﬁeld case [13,14], the evaporation process changes drasti-

cally. At a given magnetic ﬁeld, the spacings between adjacent sublevels (|∆m| = 1) are not

equal and the direct multi-photon transition from trapping to non-trapping states becomes

negligible. Evaporation of hot atoms can only happen via a sequence of one-photon transi-

tions of limited eﬃciency (see ﬁg. 8 in [15]) separated in space. This results in long lasting

atoms in the m = +1 and m = 0 states [16] responsible for hindered evaporative cooling.

Moreover, transitions to non-trapping states are suppressed at the end of the evaporation

ramp, leading to an interruption of cooling before BEC is reached.

To overcome these limitations, 3 distinct RF ﬁelds can be used to induce a direct three

photon transition from the m = +2 trapping state to the m = −1 non trapping state. At

a magnetic ﬁeld B, the three RF frequencies must match the transition frequencies deﬁned

by:

ω0 − δω ′

0 = (E2 − E1)/¯h

ω0 = (E1 − E0)/¯h

(3)

ω0 + δω0 = (E0 − E−1)/¯h

with Em taken from eq.(2).

Fig. 1 represents all possible transitions induced by these three RF frequencies in the

magnetic ﬁeld deﬁned in eq.(1). At position K, each RF ﬁeld is resonant with a given

transition : the smallest RF frequency with the (m = +2) → (m = +1) transition, the

intermediate frequency with the (m = +1) → (m = 0) transition, and the largest frequency

with the (m = 0) → (m = −1) transition; this is where the 3-photon transition occurs.

Because of the ordering of the three RF frequencies, the points where one-photon transitions

3

can be induced from m = +2 to m = +1 by the two larger frequencies are located beyond

K (the multi-photon knife). Consequently, during the evaporation, hot atoms will ﬁrst

encounter the three photon knife and be expelled from the trap, provided that the RF

power is large enough to enable eﬃcient multi-photon adiabatic passage to the non-trapping

state m = −1.

The discussion above shows that in principle, the multi-frequency evaporation requires a

synchronized non trivial sweep of three diﬀerent frequencies in the 100 MHz range, with an

accuracy of a few kHz (see below). We have rather implemented a simpliﬁed scheme where

the three frequencies are obtained by mixing a carrier at frequency ωRF with a smaller

frequency δωRF. We then obtain 3 equally spaced radiofrequency ﬁelds : ωRF − δωRF, ωRF,

ωRF + δωRF, of approximately the same power (as checked with a spectrum analyzer). Since

in general δω0 and δω ′

0 are slightly diﬀerent, the RF frequencies will not exactly match the

transition frequencies of eq.(3). Nonetheless, they compensate the second order (quadratic)

term of the Zeeman shift, and should work under certain condition discussed hereafter.

At the position where the three-photon transition is resonant, the carrier frequency ωRF

will verify

3ω0 + δω0 − δω ′

0 = 3ωRF

(4)

but there will be a residual detuning for each one photon step of the multi-photon transition.

For example, the optimum δωRF that maximizes the multi-photon transition probability will

be

δωRF =

δω0 + δω ′

0

2

(5)

and the residual detunings for each intermediate steps of the three photons transition are

both equal to

∆ =

δω0 − δω ′

0

6

.

(6)

If the Rabi frequency ΩRF associated with each one photon transition is signiﬁcantly larger

than the residual detuning ∆, the multi-photon transition is quasi resonant in the interme-

4

diate levels, leading to an eﬀective Rabi frequency Ωeﬀ ∝ ΩRF. If on the other hand ΩRF is

smaller than ∆, the eﬀective Rabi frequency is

Ωeﬀ ∝

RF

Ω3
∆2

(7)

and the multi-photon transition is ineﬃcient for evaporation ; we are then in the scheme of

hindered and interrupted evaporation. We therefore expect that our scheme will be eﬃcient

for small enough magnetic ﬁeld when the residual detuning ∆ is smaller than the one-photon

Rabi frequency ΩRF.

Table I gives the values of the Zeeman shifts for various magnetic ﬁelds and the diﬀerence

δω0 − δω ′

0. For the RF power used in this scheme, the one photon Rabi frequency ΩRF is of

the order of 10 kHz, and the discussion above shows that our simpliﬁed 3-knives evaporation

scheme should work for magnetic ﬁelds signiﬁcantly less than a hundred Gauss. This is what

we observe. It is impossible to achieve BEC in bias ﬁelds of 207 Gauss and 110 Gauss, but

BEC is obtained in a trap with a bias ﬁeld of 56 Gauss, by using an appropriate sideband

splitting δωRF kept constant while ramping down the carrier frequency ωRF.

Figure 2 shows the eﬀect of the sideband splitting δωRF at a bias ﬁeld value of 56 Gauss.

We have plotted the number of condensed atoms as a function of δωRF, all other parameters

being kept unchanged. This is a good indication of the eﬃciency of the evaporation. The

curve shows a maximum at δωRF = 2π × 0.45 MHz. This value veriﬁes equation (5) for

a magnetic ﬁeld of 56.6 Gauss. This magnetic ﬁeld corresponds to the position of the RF

knife at the end of the ramp. We conclude that frequency matching is mostly important in

the last part of the radiofrequency ramp. The width of the curve is about 10 kHz (HWHM)

which corresponds to power broadening [17].

Table II report experimental data, showing quantitatively the eﬃciency of our simpliﬁed

3-knives scheme, without which BEC could not be obtained at 56 Gauss. It is interesting to

note that even when the magnetic ﬁeld is too large to allow our simpliﬁed 3-knives scheme

to reach BEC, it is nevertheless more eﬃcient than a simple 1-frequency knife, since it

allows us to reach a signiﬁcantly lower temperature. It is also remarkable that an eﬃcient

5

evaporation was obtained at a bias ﬁeld of 56 Gauss, since the beginning of the evaporation

takes place in a larger magnetic ﬁeld (of the order of 200 Gauss) where the condition (5)

does not hold, and the detuning of the intermediate one photon transitions is much larger

than the Rabi frequency ΩRF. Although it has not been much noticed, a similar situation

is encountered in most BEC experiments (using 1-frequency knife evaporation) : the non

linear Zeeman eﬀect at the beginning of the evaporation is often much larger than the Rabi

frequency, and the evaporation hampering described in [4] is certainly happening then. The

success of these experiments as well as of our 3-frequencies scheme shows that whether

the evaporation is hindered or not only matters at the end of the evaporation ramp. To

understand qualitatively this observation, we can note that the heating induced by the atoms

populating the intermediate levels should not vary drastically with the temperature of the

cooled cloud. At the beginning of the evaporation, i.e. “high” temperatures, the relative

heating stays negligible [18]. Close to the end, i.e. “low” temperature, when heating should

give rise to hampered evaporative cooling, evaporation is fully eﬃcient and the intermediate

levels are completely depleted. This could explain the success of BEC experiments. To

verify these assumptions, more theoretical work, for instance in the spirit of [5], is needed.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a scheme to circumvent the hindrance and inter-

ruption of evaporative cooling in the presence of non linear Zeeman eﬀect. We implement a

3-frequency evaporative knife by a modulation of the RF ﬁeld, yielding two sidebands. This

scheme allows us to obtain BEC of 87Rb atoms in the (F = 2, m = +2) ground state in a

bias ﬁeld of 56 Gauss, where the standard 1-frequency RF evaporation scheme fails. Our

observations also support the physical ideas presented in our previous work to explain the

hindrance and interruption of evaporative cooling in a high magnetic ﬁeld, as well as the

qualitative discussions of this paper.

The success of this simpliﬁed scheme and the complementary observations reported in

this paper, indicate that a more sophisticated multi-frequency evaporation scheme should

work at larger bias ﬁeld, provided that the resonance in the intermediate steps of the multi-

photon transition is achieved within the Rabi frequency of the one photon transitions, at

6

the end of the evaporative ramp.

[16] The m = 0 state is a trapping state in this manifold because of the non linearity of the

Zeeman eﬀect.

[17] This conclusion was corroborated by a calculation of the energies of the dressed states

for a given set {ΩRF, ωRF, δωRF}. From the calculated energy splitting C ≃ Ωeﬀ at the

(m = +2, m = −1) level crossing, we used the two-levels Landau Zener probability that

the atoms will follow an adiabatic transition. We veriﬁed that for small Rabi frequencies

12

(i.e. small evaporation eﬃciency), as in our experiment, this 3-photon transition is the

most probable transition at any sideband detuning δωRF. This numerical calculation can

be used to ﬁt the experimental data. We can estimate the one-photon Rabi frequency

ΩRF = 2π × 8 ± 4 kHz.

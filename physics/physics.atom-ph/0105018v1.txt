We present numerical values for the self-energy shifts predicted by QED (Quantum Electrody-
namics) for hydrogenlike ions (nuclear charge 60 ≤ Z ≤ 110) with an electron in an n = 3, 4 or 5
level with high angular momentum (5/2 ≤ j ≤ 9/2). Applications include predictions of precision
transition energies and studies of the outer-shell structure of atoms and ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The one-loop self-energy is the largest radiative correction in atoms and ions. It has been known for many years
that for high nuclear charge Z, results obtained by a perturbation expansion in the number of interactions with
the nucleus, i.e., in powers of Zα are not accurate. There are many recent examples in which self-energy shifts for
high principal quantum numbers and/or angular momenta are needed. For example, the outer-shell structure of very
heavy elements is being studied to determine electron aﬃnities or chemical properties. Similarly, transitions within
the ground conﬁguration of the Ti-like iso-electronic sequence (with outer-shell structure 3d4) have been measured
for very high nuclear charges Z [1–7], with results that diﬀer systematically from theoretical calculations [8–11] that
do not include the self-energy correction for the 3d5/2 level beyond the Bethe logarithm and lowest-order electron
anomalous moment. The same is true for systematic studies of magnesiumlike ions [12]. Yet it has been shown recently
that eﬀects beyond the lowest order are large at high Z, even for rather large n and angular momenta [13]. Several
calculations have thus been undertaken. Preliminary results have been reported for the 6s and 8d3/2 shells [13],
while Labzowski et al. [14] and Yerokhin and Shabaev [15] have calculated a limited number of self-energy level shifts
with methods developed recently. In this paper, we provide accurate calculations for nuclear charge Z in the range
60 ≤ Z ≤ 110 for an electron in a level with n = 3, 4, or 5 with high angular momentum (5/2 ≤ j ≤ 9/2). The results
increase considerably the number of atoms for which the exact one-loop self-energy is available.

After the seminal works of Brown et al. [16] and of Desiderio and Johnson [17], one of us (PJM) developed an
eﬃcient method for evaluating the self-energy level shifts in a framework where the electron-nucleus interaction is
treated non-perturbatively. This method was ﬁrst applied to the 1s level of one-electron atoms [18,19]. Later, the
self-energy contribution to the Lamb shift of the 2s and 2p1/2 states was studied [20], and subsequently, all levels
with principal quantum number n = 2 were evaluated with higher accuracy [21]. Additional excited states with
3 ≤ n ≤ 5 and angular momentum j ≤ 3/2 were studied more recently in Ref. [22], where the diﬃculties which arise
for highly-excited states are described and solved for low angular momenta. Self-energy calculations for states with
angular momentum j > 3/2 has been a long standing problem since the publication of the original method [18].

In the present paper we extend the self-energy calculation methods developed in [18–22] to arbitrary angular
momenta. We derive general, numerically eﬃcient formulas for the angular integrals that appear in self-energy
expressions; these integrals were only known for states with j ≤ 3/2. We perform calculations for 5/2 ≤ j ≤ 9/2
and for principal quantum numbers n = 3, 4 and 5. The numerically eﬃcient renormalization technique described in
Refs. [23,24] is used, as its formulation is independent of the atomic level. This method yields precise results for the
self-energy shifts; other groups have published numerical results based on various numerical strategies that give less
precise values [25–27].

The implementation of our formulas on a computer is simple, since the only mathematical objects used in our
ﬁnal expressions are Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind and (squared) Wigner 3j symbols with all angular momentum
projections set to zero. Our expressions are optimized for numerical calculations and have proved to yield very

accurate results. Our formulas for electrons with angular momentum j = 3/2 diﬀer from known expressions [21,28],
because we have adapted our results to more accurate numerical calculations.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we recall the principle of the self-energy calculation we use. In
Sec. III we summarize our formulas for the self-energy angular integrals, which constitute the main analytical result
of the present work. In Sec. IV we present numerical results for levels d5/2, f5/2, f7/2, g7/2 and g9/2 with principal
quantum numbers 3 ≤ n ≤ 5. Detailed derivations of the formulas presented in Sec. III are given in Sec. V, while
derivations by a diﬀerent method, used for checking purposes, are presented in Sec. VI. Section VII concludes the
paper.

Throughout this article, we use the convention

II. SELF-ENERGY SHIFT FORMULA

The expression for the self-energy shift of an electronic state n can be written for a large class of potentials V(x)

as the sum

of a low-energy part EL and a high-energy part EH given (in units in which ¯h = c = me = 1) by [18]

state n, and G is the Dirac Green’s function: G(z) = (H − z)−1, where H = α · p + V + β is the Dirac Hamiltonian.
Indices l and m are summed from 1 to 3, and index µ is summed from 0 to 3. The contour CH extends from −i∞ to
0 − iǫ and from 0 + iǫ to +i∞.

Since the high-energy part and the renormalization procedure described in Refs. [21–24] are already known for
arbitrary angular momenta, this paper is concerned with the low-energy part (2). For a spherically symmetric
potential V, a separation of the photon propagator and of Dirac wavefunctions into radial and angular parts yields
the following expression for the low-energy part of the self-energy:

Dirac angular quantum number of the electron for which the self-energy is calculated is denoted by κn. Detailed
deﬁnitions of these notations can be found in Ref. [18].

Expression (4) can for instance be applied to a pure Coulomb potential V or to the self-energy screening correc-
tion [29]. The potential V aﬀects the radial components f and G; on the contrary, the angular coeﬃcients A are
independent of V; this paper provides analytical formulas for these coeﬃcients.

III. FINAL FORMULAS FOR THE ANGULAR INTEGRALS

In this section, we present our ﬁnal formulas for the angular coeﬃcients Aij

κ,κn introduced in Eq. (4). Our results
can be directly implemented on a computer. Derivations of the results presented here can be found in Sec. V A and
Sec. V B.

Despite the non-symmetrical form (10), the quantity L(a, b, c) is totally symmetrical with respect to any permutation
of its arguments, as we prove in Sec. V A 2.

3. Numerical implementation

Equation (9) can be readily implemented on a computer.

In Eq. (9), no term is singular (with respect to the
parameters b, x1 and x2). In fact, the expansion of the Bessel functions about the origin [30] is such that jl(z) = O(zl);
singularities could appear only through j0(z)/z, which is singular as z → 0. But l = 0 imposes that l + lκ + l−κn be
even, so that j0(z)/z is actually never used in Eq. (9).

Since the number of terms in Eq. (10) is smaller than c, we have decided to set c = l−κn in Eq. (9), because l−κn is
small, being the orbital momentum of the level for which the self-energy is calculated [18]. Furthermore, we note that
in Eq. (9), for a given l, only one term inside the brackets contribute to A11
κ,κn because of parity selection on Wigner
3j-coeﬃcients [31] and in our quantity L(a, b, c) of Eq. (10).

We have also checked whether result (9) could yield strong numerical cancellations in the following ranges of

parameters

which are typical of the values used in numerical calculations [18]. We checked for possible cancellations with an
arbitrary precision in the following two cases: (a) two numbers add up to a very small one (about 10−8 smaller than
the two numbers); (b) a large number is added to a number which is much smaller (by a factor of 10−9). Our checks
have shown that no such numerical problems arise with the terms of Eq. (9) when the summation is done by starting
from the higher limit lκ + l−κn ; this choice of summation order is numerically motivated by the over-exponential
damping of the spherical Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind [32]:

when l > ez/2; thus, summing the terms of the ﬁnal result (9) with decreasing l’s allows one to include larger and
larger terms in the total sum, which is necessary for obtaining accurate numerical sums.

We have numerically tested formula (9) against Mathematica, against the alternate formula presented below
[Eq. (52)] and against Mohr’s implementation of his special cases |κn| ≤ 2; we have found excellent accuracy in
the parameter ranges used in the low-energy part calculations of the self-energy [18,21,22], i.e., in the range of
parameters reached by our calculations of the self-energy in ions with Z ≥ 10:

b ∈ [0, 1], x1, x2 ∈ [0, 100],

which is the generalization to any atomic state of the angular coeﬃcient A12
κ,κn of the low-energy part of the self-
energy [18]. Equation (15) has a few crucial computational advantages: (a) all the sums contain a ﬁnite number of
terms; (b) there are no large terms due to small b, x1 or x2; in fact, it is easy to see that the only divergent quantities
can come from jl=0(z)/z, but that this quantity is actually always multiplied by 0. We thus gain numerical accuracy
compared to the published formulas [21,22] for the special cases κn = ±2.

As for A11

κ,κn , we have checked whether result (15) yields strong numerical cancellations in the parameter ranges
deﬁned by (11). Our checks have shown that no such numerical problems arise with the terms of Eq. (15) [evaluated
in the order indicated by the parentheses, with summations done from the higher limit because of Eq. (12)], except
sometimes for the minimum l, i.e., for

2. Numerical optimization

l = lmin ≡ |lκ − lκn|.

However, we have cured this disease by noticing patterns in the way numerical cancellation appear: we have
experimentally found four diﬀerent areas of the (κ, κn) plane, deﬁned by which of the terms of Eq. (15) cancel each
other; the “terms” are deﬁned here by separating terms with zero, one and two derivatives of Bessel functions: we select
the four terms of Eq. (15) associated with [jlmin(y1)/y1][jlmin(y2)/x2], j′
lmin(y2), and
j′
lmin(y1)j′
By using explicit polynomial formulas for the orbital angular momenta lκ and lκn in each region, it is possible to
obtain simpliﬁed expressions for the four terms of Eq. (15); terms can then generally be grouped together [in a way
that depends on the area in which (κ, κn) lies] through the Bessel identity [30]

lmin(y1)[jlmin(y2)/x2], [jlmin(y1)/x1]j′

lmin(y2).

l
z

jl(z) − j′

l(z) = jl+1(z).

We have found numerically that this identity can yield very strong numerical cancellations between the l = lmin terms
of Eq. (15).

Thus, we have mathematically found the equations of the four cancellation areas, and we have used identity (16)
in order to express the ﬁnal result in terms of the right -hand side of Eq. (16) instead of numerically calculating the
left -hand side of the identity. The precise shapes of the areas in the (κ, κn) plane are

(15)

(16)

(17)

A numerical implementation of Eq. (15) should thus calculate the terms corresponding to l = lmin with the following
expressions, which depend on the area in which (κ, κn) lies:

area 1: κκn < 0 and κ(lκ − lκn ) ≤ 0
area 2: κκn < 0 and κ(lκ − lκn ) > 0
area 3: κκn > 0 and κ(lκ − lκn ) ≤ 0
area 4: κκn > 0 and κ(lκ − lκn ) > 0.

Furthermore, no factor of the form j0(z)/z, which diverges as z → 0 appears anymore in our formulas for A12

κ,κn: such
a factor can only be found in the l = lmin term of result (15); but Eq. (18) must be used for this term. lmin ≡ |lκ − lκn |
is obviously never encountered in the ﬁrst two areas of Eq. (18). In the last two areas of Eq. (18), j0(z)/z is used but
multiplied by a factor zero, as can be seen by using the fact that κκn > 0.

In summary, Eqs. (15) and (18) give numerically optimized formulas for the angle coeﬃcient A12

κ,κn of Eq. (14). We
have numerically tested these formulas against Mathematica, against the alternate formula presented below [Eq. (60)],
and against Mohr’s implementation of his special cases |κn| ≤ 2; we have found excellent accuracy in the physical
parameter ranges (13).

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE SELF-ENERGY

The formulas (9), (15) and (18) presented above allow us to numerically evaluate the QED self-energy contribution
EL formally expressed in Eq. (4). The other self-energy contribution [EH, Eq. (3)] can be calculated for an arbitrary
electronic state by means of previously published methods [21]. We present in this section numerical evaluations of
the self-energy of atomic electrons with principal quantum number 3 ≤ n ≤ 5 and with angular number 3 ≤ |κ| ≤ 5,
in hydrogenlike ions with nuclear charge 60 ≤ Z ≤ 110. We used a Fortran implementation of formulas (9), (15) and
(18), as well as previously published numerical procedures [19,21–24,29,33,34].

Numerical results are most conveniently expressed in terms of the usual scaled self-energy F :

ESE ≡

α
π

(Zα)4
n3 F (Zα)mec2,

(19)

where ESE is the self-energy shift (1). Our evaluations of the scaled value F are presented in Tables I–IV. When
represented as a function of Zα, our values display smooth curves, as can be seen in Figs. 1–5.

From Figs. 1–3, we notice that the scaled self-energy does not greatly depend on the atomic level n; put in other
words, the n-dependence of the self-energy is quite well captured by the scaling 1/n3 of Eq. (19), as has been observed
for s and d3/2 levels [13]. On the practical side, the slow variation of the scaled self-energy F with respect to n allows
one to use the values we present here as estimates for higher levels n.

We have also grouped self-energy values by atomic level n in Figs. 4 and 5. We notice that states with identical
orbital angular momenta have self-energy curves that look parallel on the scale we used. This property can be
understood for low nuclear charge Z, since states other than s states have the property that F is dominated in this
region by a function of the form

A40 + (Zα)2 log[(Zα)−2]A61

for Zα ≪ 1, and where A40 and A61 are the usual coeﬃcients of the semi-analytic expansion of the self-energy
shift [35]. (The (Zα)2A60 contribution is negligible for Zα → 0: (Zα)2 = o[(Zα)2 log([Zα]−2)].) It turns out that
for d, f, g. . . states, A61 depends only on the orbital angular momentum (This is due to the smooth behavior of
the wavefunction of such states at the origin [36].); as a consequence, the self-energy curves for states with identical
quantum numbers n and l (angular momentum) are parallel in the limit Zα → 0. For the higher Z values of the
results we present here, the expansion of F in Zα is not supposed to hold; however our numerical values show that
the diﬀerence between the scaled self-energies of two levels with the same n and l varies only on the level of a few
percents in the range 60 ≤ Z ≤ 110. Precisely, the diﬀerence between the self-energy F for two states with identical
n and l is well approximated by the value of this diﬀerence at the limit Zα → 0, which is known to be [37]

lim
Zα→0

[Fn,κ=−(l+1)(Zα) − Fn,κ=l(Zα)] =

1
l(l + 1)

,

(20)

6

which approximates (to the level of a few percents) the splitting between states with identical n and l present in our
results; it would be interesting to ﬁnd an explanation of this property of the scaled self-energy F at high Z. At low Z,
the splitting (20) is due to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron [37], and maybe does this eﬀect dominate
the splitting we observe between states of identical n and l in our high-Z results.

Our results are coherent with the numerical results published by Yerokhin and Shabaev [25] for nuclear charges
Z = 74, 83 and 92, as shown in Tables V and VI. However, we note that our evaluations of the self-energy often lie below
the values of [25], and that our results have uncertainties smaller by about two orders of magnitude. Furthermore,
the value that lies the furthest from their error bars is that of the 5d5/2 level for Z = 74, which is located relatively
close (−1.2 standard deviations) from the previously published result [25].

V. CALCULATION OF THE ANGULAR COEFFICIENTS: METHOD FOR OPTIMIZED NUMERICAL
EVALUATION

Our analytical evaluations of A11
First, the dependence on ξ of the integrands of Eqs. (6) and (14) is made simple by expanding the T function with
partial waves. In fact, in Eq. (7), ρ is the distance between the two interaction points of the self-energy, ξ being
the cosine of the angle between these two points [18]; the T function of Eq. (8) can therefore be expanded in partial
waves [30]:

κ,κn [18] rest on a few cornerstones.

κ,κn and A12

T [ρ(x1, x2, ξ)] =

(2l + 1)Pl(ξ)jl(y1)jl(y2),

(21)

where we still have

1
b

Xl≥0

y1 ≡ bx1 and y2 ≡ bx2.

Thus, integrals of terms of Eqs. (6) and (14) which do not contain derivatives of T are simply integrations of polynomials
in ξ. And since d/dρ can be calculated with ∂/∂ξ [see Eq. (22) below], all terms are as well integrals of polynomials.
Second, integrations of polynomials can be expanded in a simple form with the help of expansions on an orthogonal
basis. Much of our work as thus been concentrated on obtaining formulas with polynomials in ξ that can be simply
expanded onto the basis of Legendre polynomials.

Third, the sum over partial waves in Eq. (21) contains an inﬁnite number of terms. Numerical calculations of
angular coeﬃcients A11
κ,κn are more accurate if only a ﬁnite number of these terms contribute to the
ﬁnal result. This can be achieved by obtaining expressions in which we can apply triangular identities on Legendre
polynomials (Legendre polynomials are a special kind of spherical harmonics); such a goal has driven our search of
numerically eﬃcient expressions for A11

κ,κn and A12

κ,κn and A12

κ,κn .

Accordingly to these principles, expansions and scalar products in Eqs. (24), (30), (34), and (45) are especially

important to the following calculations.

We describe in this section our calculation (9) of the integral over ξ in the original expression of the angular

coeﬃcient A11

κ,κn of Eq. (6).

Following Mohr [38], we evaluate the derivative 1/ρ× d/dρ of A11

κ,κn in Eq. (6) by using a diﬀerentiation with respect

to the ξ parameter of the ρ function of Eq. (7): in fact, for any function f , the deﬁnition of ρ implies that

κ,κn in which products of three Legendre polynomials (or

With Eqs. (21) and (22), we thus obtain a form of A11
derivatives of Legendre polynomials) must be integrated:

Legendre polynomials, which we do now. The derivatives of Legendre polynomials are related to Legendre polynomials
of orders −1 and 1 by the following identities [31]:

a(ξ)P ′

and the Legendre polynomials of a given order and degree are directly related to spherical harmonics [31]:

where the spherical harmonics Yl,m(θ, φ) is deﬁned with the convention of Edmonds [31], and where P m
l (ξ) is the
Legendre polynomial of degree l and order m [30]. We thus see that the left-hand side of Eq. (25) can be rewritten
with spherical harmonics: in fact, we have from Eqs. (26) and (27) that

At this point, it is useful to have a closer look at parity selection rules in Eq. (30). Since only terms with a + b + i
even contribute to the sum over i in Eq. (30) (because of the second 3j-coeﬃcient), we can use the following formula
in Eq. (30):

provided that a + b + i is even [39]. On the other hand, if a + b + i is odd, then Eq. (31) does not hold; however, the
second 3j-coeﬃcient of Eq. (30) is zero in this case, so that we can safely plug Eq. (31) into Eq. (30):

This simple expansion over the Legendre polynomials is of particular interest in the sequel and will be used many
times.

With the help of Eq. (32), the integration of Eq. (25) is straightforward if we know the coeﬃcients of P ′

c(ξ) over

the Legendre polynomials; they are easily obtained through an integration by parts:

which is contained in Eq. (10) and (25).

The angular coeﬃcient A11

κ,κn obtained in Eq. (23) can then directly be evaluated with the help of results (24) and

(34), and we directly obtain our ﬁnal expression (9) for this coeﬃcient.

The evaluation of A11

κ,κn that we presented in this section also shows that only terms of Eq. (6) with l between
|lκ − l−κn | and lκ + l−κn are non-zero; this fact, which was not obvious in the original formula, is explicitly expressed
in our ﬁnal result (9).

B. Integration in A12

κ,κn

The angular coeﬃcient A12

κ,κn, in particular because second-order derivatives
of T appear in Eq. (14). We show in this section how we calculate the integration over ξ in Eq. (14) and obtain the
ﬁnal expression Eq. (15) [which must be combined with Eq. (18) in numerical applications].

κ,κn is more diﬃcult to evaluate than A11

A ﬁrst step consists in unifying the various terms of A12

the last term of Eq. (14) by Plκn (ξ) and P ′

lκn (ξ) with the help of

κ,κn in Eq. (14); we can replace the Plκn−1 (ξ) = Pl−κn (ξ) of

which can be easily deduced from [31], and which implies that

We note, however, that a second -order derivative ∂2T /∂ξ2 appears in the ﬁrst term of the last line in Eq. (40). In
order to obtain a simple expression in which only ﬁrst -order derivatives are present, we can use the following sort of
integration by parts with Legendre polynomials:

can easily be proved by integrating by parts and by using the diﬀerential equation of the Legendre polynomials [30]:

We thus transform the ﬁrst term on the last line of Eq. (40) with Eq. (41) [with l ≡ lκn, f ≡ ∂T /∂ξ and g ≡
(1 − ξ2)P ′

lκ (ξ)]: this term contains

κ .

We next use the partial-wave expansion (21) of the T function in order to simplify integrations over angles; since T
depends on ξ only through Legendre polynomials [Eq. (21)], inserting Eq. (43) into the angular coeﬃcient (40) yields
only integrals of one of the following forms:

where the third Legendre polynomial of each line comes from Eq. (21). We have already all the tools that allow us to
calculate them: Eqs. (24), (25) and (32), along with the orthogonality relation [30]:

After using expansion (21) and the values for integrals (44), we arrive directly at the ﬁnal result (15) for the coeﬃcient
A12
κ,κn . We insist on the fact that the l = |lκ − lκn| term of Eq. (15) must, however, be evaluated with Eq. (18) in
numerical calculations.

As for A11

κ,κn , the evaluation of A12

κ,κn made in this section shows that the sum in Eq. (14) contains a ﬁnite number
of terms: only the terms of Eq. (14) with l between |lκ − lκn| and lκ + lκn are non-zero, as expressed in our ﬁnal
result (15).

VI. ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE ANGULAR COEFFICIENTS

In order to check our ﬁnal results (9), (15) and (18), we derived and implemented independently a second set of
expressions, that we compared to the results of the method presented in Sec. V over a wide range of arguments. This
allowed us to limit the number of comparisons with Mathematica; in fact, direct integrations of Eqs. (6) and (14) lead
to very lengthy calculations. We found that the method presented in this subsection is accurate almost everywhere,
but that it is slower than the method presented in Sec. III and V. We present here the main steps of an alternate
calculation of the integrals of Eqs. (6) and (14).

A. Angular integration in A11

κ,κn

We evaluate A11

κ,κn, starting again from the most detailed basic expression, Eq. (6). The idea of this second
evaluation is to express the integrand solely in terms of Legendre polynomials of the variable ξ; doing so will allow us
to use the integration result of Eq. (24).

With this goal in mind, we remove factors 1 − ξ2 and ξ in Eq. (6) with the following Legendre polynomial identity

[adapted to our particular form (6) of orbital angular momenta]:

and with the help of the Legendre recursion relation

The T function of Eq. (21) can then be expanded with Legendre polynomials with Eqs. (21) and (22), and we can
integrate once with Eq. (24); we thus get

A numerical implementation of Eq. (51) can make use of the fact that parity properties of the Legendre polynomials

is given explicitly by Eq. (51).

Moreover, numerical implementations are facilitated by the fact that the summation over l in Eq. (52) contains a
ﬁnite number of non-zero terms—even though this is not obvious from the above form—, as noted for deﬁnition (6)
in Sec. V: in Eq. (52), the summation over l can be restricted to the range |lκ − l−κn | . . . lκ − l−κn .

B. Oﬀ-diagonal element

To evaluate A12

κ,κn we start from the most general published formula [Eq. (14)]. As for A12
κ,κn, the idea of the
derivation to follow consists in transforming integrations over ξ into integrals of products of Legendre polynomials
only, so that we can use the integration result (24). The ﬁrst step is again accomplished by removing 1 − ξ2 factors
with the help of Eqs. (46) and (47), and by calculating derivatives of T with Eq. (22):

Both these quantities can be expressed by means of an expansion of the Legendre polynomials derivatives with
Eq. (50). We thus evaluate the ﬁrst expression as

where we have integrated products of three Legendre polynomials with (24. This formula is coherent with the fact
that symmetry properties of Legendre polynomials [31] show that expression (55) yields 0 if m + n + l is even; this
property should be used in numerical implementations.

The function with a second-order derivative [Eq. (56)] can be evaluated by using an integration by parts:

Symmetry properties of the Legendre polynomials and deﬁnition (56) show that this quantity is zero whenever l+m+n

where the various D quantities are given explicitly in Eqs. (51), (57) and (58). We have checked the above formula by
comparing Fortran and Mathematica outputs for many values relevant to the present work. Furthermore, numerical
implementations should make use of the fact that it is suﬃcient to do the summation over l in Eq. (60) only with l in
the range |lκ − lκn| . . . (lκ + lκn), because all other terms are zero [since Eq. (14) contains only these terms, as noted
in Sec. V].

VII. CONCLUSION

We have obtained in Eqs. (9), (15) and (18) analytic formulas for angular coeﬃcients that appear in an eﬃcient
numerical method of calculation of the electron self-energy in hydrogenlike atoms [18]; only results for electrons with
angular momentum 1/2 ≤ j ≤ 3/2 were previously obtainable with this method [18,22]. Recently developed numerical
renormalization techniques [23,24,29] allowed us to give numerical self-energy shifts for high-j states (5/2 ≤ j ≤ 9/2)
of n = 3, 4 and 5 levels in the range 60 ≤ Z ≤ 110; our results are in agreement with recently available results [25],
but we provide values for many other nuclear charges Z, and the precision of our calculations is generally greater by
about two orders of magnitude. These numerical results could for instance serve to include QED eﬀects in many-body
atomic calculations in atoms and ions with electrons of high angular momentum [7].

We are grateful to the CINES (Montpellier, France) for a grant of time on its SP2 and SP3 parallel computers. We

wish to thank Dr. U. Jentschura for very interesting discussions.

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We have demonstrated a recoil-free spectroscopy on the 1S0 − 3P1 transition of strontium atoms
conﬁned in a one-dimensional optical lattice. By investigating the wavelength and polarization
dependence of the ac Stark shift acting on the 1S0 and 3P1(mJ = 0) states, we determined the
magic wavelength where the Stark shifts for both states coincide. The Lamb-Dicke conﬁnement
provided by this Stark-free optical lattice enabled the measurement of the atomic spectrum free
from Doppler as well as recoil shifts.

Recent dramatic advances in optical metrology have
made it possible to directly link two optical frequencies
with an uncertainty below 10−18 [1] and to coherently di-
vide an optical frequency down to a radio frequency de-
ﬁned by the SI second [2]. Owing to these techniques, a
stringent comparison of the stability and accuracy among
optical clocks becomes feasible [3] and leads to an im-
proved deﬁnition of time and a test of the time variation
of a fundamental constant [4]. Up to now, two sorts of
absorbers, single ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR)
[5] and neutral atoms in free space, have been exten-
sively studied for optical clocks. Tightly conﬁned single
ions, enabling a long interaction time and the Doppler- as
well as the recoil-free absorption [6], have, so far, led to
the narrowest optical spectrum [7]. However, the stabil-
ity was severely limited by the quantum projection noise
(QPN) [8] of the single absorber. The ensemble of neu-
tral atoms, in contrast, provides a far better QPN limit.
The accuracy of the measurement is known to be aﬀected
by the atomic motion, as residual Doppler shifts are in-
troduced through the imperfect wave front of the probe
beam [9, 10].

These two approaches could merge if an ensemble of
neutral atoms were separately prepared in the LDR. An
optical lattice made by the interference pattern of a light
ﬁeld [11] conﬁnes atoms in a small volume, which satisﬁes
the Lamb-Dicke condition [5]. However, an impediment
for the precision measurement is the complete control
over the perturbations caused by this container, since the
Stark shift potential strongly depends on the electronic
state, which is not the case for ion-trapping potential.

alkali atoms in the lower-lying hyperﬁne states.

In this Letter, we report the recoil-free spectroscopy
of strontium atoms conﬁned in a one-dimensional opti-
cal lattice by applying the technique to the (5s2)1S0
−
(5s5p)3P1 “clock” transition. By investigating the wave-
length as well as the polarization dependence of the dif-
ferential dipole-polarizability, we have determined the
magic wavelength, where the Stark shift on the clock
transition vanishes, i.e., ∆α = 0.

In order to discuss the polarization dependence of the
Stark shift and the inﬂuence of Raman coherences be-
tween the m, m′ magnetic sublevels of the

FIG. 1: (a) Level diagram and optical coupling related to the
clock transition of 1S0 −3P1. The 1S0 state is dominantly cou-
pled to 1P1, while the 3P1 state is coupled to the upper triplet

pend on the polarization of the laser ﬁeld, as depicted by the

of mb in the
state accessed by the light polarization
of ˆǫ. For the a = 1S0 state, Λ(b, ˆǫ) does not show any
polarization dependence because of the isotropy of the
state. However, for the upper state of the “clock transi-
tion” a = 3P1(mJ = 0), the coupling strength of Λ(b, ˆǫ)
strongly depends on the light polarization. This is illus-
trated in Fig. 1(a) by the thickness of the arrows: taking
the 3S1 state as the
state, this state is not coupled
by the π polarized light but by the σ± polarized light.
In this way, the Stark shift for the 3P1 state is critically
aﬀected by the applied light polarization.

Our experimental setup and the procedure to form an
optical lattice have been described elsewhere [17, 18].
A few µK cold strontium atoms were magneto-optically
cooled and trapped on the narrow 1S0
3P1 transition
[19]. During the ﬁnal cooling and trapping period of 30
ms, the atoms were loaded into a one-dimensional op-
tical lattice. A frequency-stabilized Ti-Sapphire laser
(Coherent, MBR-110) was coupled into a polarization-
maintaining optical ﬁber and focused into the atom cloud

by an objective lens. A quarter-wave and a half-wave
plate were used to compensate the birefringence of the
optical ﬁber and obtain a linearly polarized light with an
arbitrary angle, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This trap beam,
with a typical power of 500 mW, was then retro-reﬂected
by a concave mirror with a radius of 25 cm to form a
standing wave, where the 1/e radius of the beam waist
was

23 µm at λL = 830 nm.

With these parameters, the axial conﬁnement fre-
quency in the 1S0 state was measured to be νS =
90 kHz by observing the ﬁrst heating sideband, as dis-
cussed later. This vibrational frequency suggested a
47 kW/cm2, a depth of
peak laser intensity of Ipeak
U = kB
610 kHz, and a radial trap fre-
quency of νr = 460 Hz, respectively. Figure 1(b) shows a
conﬁguration for the spectroscopy. The conﬁned atoms
were excited by a probe laser with a wave vector of ~kp,
which was introduced through the dichroic concave mir-
~kL. The
ror and superimposed on the lattice beam with
axial conﬁnement of νS gave the Lamb-Dicke parameter
of η = ph/2M νS/λCLK = 0.24, where M is the atomic
mass and λCLK = 689 nm, the wavelength of the 1S0
3P1

clock transition. A bias magnetic ﬁeld of
= 0.5 G
was applied parallel to the probe electric ﬁeld of ~Ep to
deﬁne the quantization axis, which split the m =
1

sublevels of the 3P1 state by
1 MHz. The
direction of the electric ﬁeld ~E of the lattice laser was
deﬁned by an angle θ with respect to the quantization
axis deﬁned by ~B0.

broadening because of the measured thermal distribution

cooling can be applied for the case of A, where the vibra-
tional frequency was nearly degenerate. A small peak at
100 kHz corresponded to the excitation of the ∆nv = +1
heating sideband, while the ∆nv =
1 excitation (cool-
ing sideband) was not visible as the atoms were quickly
sideband-cooled to the vibrational ground state [20].

The change of the resonance frequency is summarized
in Fig. 2(b) as a function of the lattice laser polarization
of θ. Since the 1S0 state has no polarization dependence,
the frequency change is attributed to the ac Stark shift
of the 3P1(mJ = 0) state. The solid curve in Fig. 2(b)
shows the diﬀerential Stark shift obtained from Eq. (2),
and the dashed lines, the corresponding Stark shifts for
the ∆nv = 0 vibrational transitions with nv = 0, 1, 2.

observed as the Stark shifts on the clock transition nearly can-
celed out, whereas non-zero diﬀerential Stark shift introduced
a frequency shift and broadening for θ ≈ π/2 (B). (b) The
change of the Stark shift as the rotation θ of the lattice elec-
tric ﬁeld. Since the light shift of the 3P1(mJ = 0) depends on
the lattice laser polarization, the frequency varies sinusoidally
depending on the components of π and the σ+ + σ− intensity.

served frequency shift should be smaller than the nv = 0
diﬀerential Stark shift because of the thermal distribu-
3.7. Since the applied Zeeman
tion of typically
shift of
1 MHz was strong enough to suppress the Ra-
man coherence among Zeeman sublevels, the polarization
dependence mainly accounted for the intensity of the π
polarized light (θ = 0) and the linear combination of
σ+ + σ− (θ = π/2), resulting in a sinusoidal change. As
the deviation from the theoretical curve was within 5 %,
in the following analysis to determine the light shifts for
θ = 0 and θ = π/2, we approximated the ﬁtting curve by
a sinusoidal function.

of atoms from the magneto-optical trap into the optical

λL, the polarization rotation θ, and the vibrational state nv,

pendence of the shifts measured for θ = π/2 around the magic
wavelength of λL = 915 nm. By linearly extrapolating to zero
laser power, the atomic resonance frequency was obtained.

atomic resonance frequency ω0 free from the Stark shifts,
we measured the power dependence of the transition fre-
quencies at several λL for θ = π/2, as shown in the inset
of Fig. 3. By linearly extrapolating IL
0, the measure-
ments at diﬀerent wavelengths converged within 1 kHz,
which was limited by the center frequency reproducibility
of our laser system [21]. We took this value as a reference
for the atomic resonance frequency and determined the
magic wavelength for θ = π/2 to be λL = 914
1 nm.
The inset also indicated that a higher-order Stark shift
due to hyperpolarizability did not make a signiﬁcant con-
tribution in this intensity range, thus justifying the nor-
malization of the Stark shifts by the trap laser intensity.
We used this magic wavelength to determine the uncer-
tain transition moments in the calculation of the Stark
shifts. Among the transition strengths listed in Ref. [22],
the (5s6s)3S
(5s5p)3P transition rate showed a rather
large discrepancy of more than 30 %. Therefore, we
took this rate as a ﬁtting parameter to locate the magic
wavelength at 914 nm. The estimated transition rate of
107/s was within the reported values in the
A = 8.5
×
107/s [22]. Using the value, we calcu-
range of 6.7
lated the diﬀerential Stark shifts shown by the solid lines
in Fig. 3. The diﬀerence between the data points and
theoretical curve is attributed to 1) the imperfect lattice
laser polarization, as indicated by error bars in the ﬁgure,
2) the uncertainty in determining the center frequency of
the spectrum due to the vibrational state spread, as in-
dicated by dashed lines, and 3) the day-to-day change of
the beam overlap of the lattice standing wave and resul-
tant intensity ﬂuctuation. We note, however, the deter-
mination of the magic point was rather accurate, since
the point is independent of the laser intensity ﬂuctuation
and occupied vibrational states of conﬁned atoms.

In summary, we have demonstrated the recoil-free
spectroscopy of neutral 88Sr atoms conﬁned in the Lamb-
Dicke regime provided by a 1D optical lattice. By adjust-
ing the Stark shifts for the probed upper and lower states,
we canceled out the perturbation of the lattice potential
on the atom spectrum, thus realizing a system similar
to ion-trapping experiments [6]. The application of this
scheme to a frequency standard is promising because si-
multaneous preparation of N neutral atoms in a 3D op-
tical lattice improves the quantum projection noise by a
factor of √N compared to the single-ion-based standard
[7]. The frequency accuracy of the present scheme may
ﬁnally be limited by the purity of the lattice-laser polar-
ization. The use of the 1S0
3P0 transition of 87Sr dra-
−
matically reduces the polarization dependence [13], which
may provide an alternative for the optical-frequency stan-
dard.

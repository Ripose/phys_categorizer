Abstract

Using a complex model potential, we have calculated the total, integrated elastic, momentum

transfer, absorption, and diﬀerential cross sections for positrons scattered from molecular hydrogen.

The widely available software package GAUSSIAN is used to generate the radial electronic charge

density of molecule which is used to produce the interaction potentials. The quasifree absorption

potential, previously developed and used for positron-atom scattering, is extended to positron

scattering from molecular targets. It is shown that this model potential approach produces accurate

results even into the low-energy regime.

INTRODUCTION

The scattering of positrons from atomic and molecular targets continues to be an area

of active investigation in both experimental and theoretical collision studies. As the abil-

ity to produce controlled positron beams continues to be reﬁned, and such beams become

available in more laboratories, a larger variety of positron-gas systems are being studied

experimentally with improving results. The state of theoretical calculations in this area

can be divided into four impact-energy (E) regimes. These are very low energy (E . 0.1

eV), low energy (0.1 eV< E < EP s) where EP s is the threshold for positronium formation,

intermediate energy (EP s < E < 1000 eV), and high energy (E > 1000 eV) regimes. Low

and very low energy calculations are typically performed at the ab initio level rather than

with model potentials partly because in this energy regime one does not have to take into

account several inelastic channels which are complicated to handle exactly [1]. Furthermore,

calculations using model potentials have performed only moderately well or even poorly at

lower energies because the projectile spends more time near the target causing the results

to be more sensitive to the details of the interaction. However, the reverse is true at in-

termediate energies. Because of the predominance of many inelastic processes, particularly

positronium formation, electronic excitation, and ionization, calculations at the ab initio

level become extremely diﬃcult. Also, in this energy regime, high-energy approximations,

such as Born-Bethe theory, cannot yet be trusted.

We will show in this paper that use of complex model potentials can produce accurate

intermediate-energy results even for positron-molecule scattering, as they have for the scat-

tering of both electrons and positrons in atomic gases [2]. However, despite the success

of this approach for atomic targets at intermediate energies, use of model potentials runs

into diﬃculties that limited their applicability to molecular targets. First, the generation

of molecular charge densities is substantially more diﬃcult than the generation of atomic

charge densities; therefore, many of the previous calculations for molecules employed the

independent-atom model [3, 4] in which the scattering process from a molecule is treated by

combining the scattering processes from the individual atoms that make up the molecule.

This approach necessarily breaks down at lower energies, depending on the geometry of the

molecule, because when the de Broglie wavelength of the incident positrons is on the order

of the size of the bond lengths between the atoms in the molecule they cannot possibly “see”

2

the molecule as a set of individual atoms. Furthermore, model potentials that assume that

the electrons of the target atom can be treated as a free electron gas are not accurate for

atomic hydrogen containing only one electron. Therefore, in this case, the independent atom

approximation for molecules containing the hydrogen atom is not expected to be very good.

Second, no good model absorption potential speciﬁcally designed for positron scattering has

existed until only recently [5]. Having no viable option, previous positron-molecule collision

calculations were carried out either using model absorption potentials that were designed

for electron scattering, or modifying those electron absorption potentials in purely empirical

ways [6].

Because of the issues just described, and despite the fact that electron scattering from

molecular hydrogen is a well-studied problem, to the best of our knowledge, there are only

two published calculations of total cross sections for positron scattering from H2 at inter-

mediate impact energies [4, 6].

In this paper, we study positron-H2 scattering in a way

that addresses both of the diﬃculties discussed in the previous paragraph. First, as will be

discussed in more detail below, the present calculations use molecular charge densities to

calculate the model potentials. By doing so, we bypass all of the issues concerning use of

the independent-atom model. As a result, not only are we able to obtain good cross section

results for scattering from H2 at intermediate impact energies, but, surprisingly, our results

are also quite good well into the low-energy regime. Second, we demonstrate the successful

extension of the quasifree model absorption potential developed for positron-atom scattering

to the scattering of positrons from molecular targets. Using a more appropriate positron

absorption potential gives better overall results with much less need for empiricism.

This paper is organized into four parts. Following the present introductory remarks, we

explain in section II the theoretical framework for our calculations. First, in subsection

II.A, we describe the interaction potentials used and discuss the relevant issues concerning

the extension of the quasifree model to molecular targets. Subsection II.B is devoted to a

discussion of how we generated the molecular charge densities (and static potential) of the

target using the commercially available software GAUSSIAN [7]. The details of how these

calculations were performed are then given in subsection II.C. In section III, we present

our results for total, integrated elastic, momentum transfer, absorption, and diﬀerential

cross sections from low to intermediate impact energies. Finally, we make some concluding
remarks in section IV. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we use atomic units (ℏ = e = me = 1)

II. THEORY

A.

Interaction Potentials

In the present calculations we model the positron-target system by a complex interaction

potential, V (r), that consists of three parts. These parts are the static potential Vst(r), the

polarization potential Vpol(r), and the absorption potential Vabs(r), such that

V (r) = Vst(r) + Vpol(r) + iVabs(r).

Each interaction potential is determined by the radially averaged electron charge density

of the target molecule, ρ(r), which is obtained using the method discussed in subsection II.B

below. The static potential is given by

Vst(r) =

where Z is the number of protons of the target (Z = 2 in the present case), b is a vector
that points from the center of the molecule to a nucleus, and r> is the larger of r and r′.

Following De Fazio et al [8], the polarization interaction is given, in terms of the electron

density, as

where αd, αq, and αo are the dipole, quadrupole, and octopole polarizabilities of the target

molecule, respectively.

In Table I, the values of the polarizabilities and their sources, as

well as other parameters used in these calculations are provided. In Eq. (3) the functions
D2ℓ+2(r) are damping functions whose purpose is to guarantee that Vpol →

The absorption potential used in this work is an extension of the quasi-free model for

(5)

where v is the local speed of the incident positron and ¯σb is the average cross section for

binary collisions between the positron and the electrons of the target molecule. One of the

important aspects of the present study is to formulate an extention of this model interac-

tion potential to the case of molecular targets. Besides the electron density, the only other

target-dependent quantity used in the absorption potential is the energy gap ∆. Within

the quasifree binary collision model, ∆ plays a dual role as both (a) the energy gap be-

tween the initial state and the ﬁnal energy state of the originally bound electron, and (b)

the lowest energy threshold for inelasic processes. For electron-atom scattering, these two

roles are consistent with each other if ∆ is set equal to the excitation threshold (Eexc) of

the target atom. However, for positron-atom scattering the formation of positronium intro-

duces another inelastic threshold which can be lower than the threshold for excitation. As

an example, for positron scattering from alkali-metal atoms the threshold for positronium

formation (EP s) is zero [13]. In the quasifree model the aborption cross section diverges as

∆

0. Thus, for many positron-atom systems one has to ﬁnd a reasonable choice for ∆

→

that will be suﬃciently close to the true inelastic threshold so as to minimize the absence

of low-energy absorption in the calculations, but not so small that cross sections begin to

diverge. Our previous investigations of positron-atom scattering [5, 13] have suggested that

the appropriate choice for ∆ is to set it equal to the lowest nonzero inelastic threshold.

In the case of positron scattering from molecular targets the inelasic threshold is eﬀec-

tively always open because of rovibrational excitation thresholds of the target molecules.

Besides the rovibrational modes, the possibility of the dissociation of the molecule adds an

additional inelastic process with threshold Ediss. In the derivation of the quasifree model,

the only inelastic processes that are considered are those that can result from a binary col-

lision between the incident positron and a target electron, namely, electronic excitation and

ionization by positron impact, and positronium formation. Obviously, rovibrational excita-

tion and dissociative processes are not part of the binary collision. This would most directly

suggest that the energy gap be set equal to EP s. However, the above considerations must

be balanced against the other role of ∆ as the threshold at which any inelastic scattering

occurs. Therefore, in the present study we have taken ∆ to equal the average of EP s and

B. The Electronic Charge Density

In the present calculations, the electronic charge density in the hydrogen molecule is

calculated with GAUSSIAN [7] using the full conﬁguration interaction method with both

single and double substitutions [14]. This code is now fast and readily available. Using the

cube=density command in GAUSSIAN, we ﬁrst generated the electronic charge density

ρ(r) on a suﬃciently large three-dimensional cubic grid to cover the needed range of the

calculation with a step size of 0.04 a0 in each direction. By interpolation [15], we then

obtained values of ρ(r) over the surface of a sphere of radius r centered upon the geometric

center of the molecule; Fig. 1 illustrates this procedure. For visual clarity, Fig. 1 only shows

points on a plane; in fact, the symmetry of H2 only requires generation of ρ(r) over one

quadrant of such a plane. The value of the radial charge density at r is then calculated by

numerical integration

ρ(r) =

In this manner, values of ρ(r) are calculated for every value of r needed in the integration

of the radial Schr¨odinger equation to be discussed in the next subsection.

For the spherically symmetric potential of Eq. (1) the scattering process is symmetric

about the direction of the incident positron. The solution uℓ(r), therefore, is generated by

where E = ℏ2k2/2m is the impact energy of the collision and ℓ is the angular momentum

quantum number which also represents the order of the partial wave [16].

Equation (11) is integrated out to a distance of 10 bohr radii from the center of the

molecule via the Numerov technique [17]. The ﬁrst 51 (ℓmax = 50) phase shifts are calculated

exactly by comparing uℓ, the radial wave function of the target plus positron system, at two

adjacent points r and r+ = r + h:

where h is the step size (h = 0.00075 a0) of the calculation, and jℓ and nℓ are the spherical

Bessel and Neumann functions evaluated using the algorithm of Gillman and Fiebig [18].

the dipole (∼ 1/r4), quadrupole (∼ 1/r6), and octopole (∼ 1/r8) parts of the asymptotic

III. RESULTS

Figure 2 shows the present results of the total cross sections for the scattering of positrons

by H2 compared with several experimental measurements. To the best of our knowledge, no

other theoretical calculations of total cross sections have been able to predict the stucture

in this curve over as large a range of positron energies as in the present calculations. These

structures extending across the low- to intermediate-energy ranges are accurately repro-

duced. The present results corrrectly predict the local minimum in the low-energy regime

near 4 eV and the local maximum in the intermediate-energy regime near 25 eV. In the

range of around 9 eV to 11 eV the present results stray outside of the error bars, overesti-

mating the experimental values. However, in this connection, it should be noted that cross

section measurements are expected to be underestimated due to the inability to discriminate

projectiles elastically scattered through small angles [20]. To get the best indication of the

quality of the present calculations, the error bars shown in Fig. 2 are the ”maximum errors”

8

as reported in Refs.

[20, 21] and not just the statistical uncertainties. Error bars for the

other experimental data are not shown as the errors reported were not of comparable detail.

In Fig. 3, we show our absorption cross section results compared to estimates based on

various measurements. The experimental points are a combination of diﬀerent experiments

for measurements made at common, or nearly common, impact energies. The present results

show good ageement with the experimental cross sections in the region of overlap. The

fact that our results overestimate the experimental points at every energy is to be expected

because the ionization cross sections are only for ﬁrst ionizations, the excitation cross sections
only account for excitations to the B1Σ state, and there is no experimental data added for

other processes (although they are expected to be small at these energies). As one would

expect, the absorption cross sections are quite sensitive to the absorption potential; the fact

that we have such good results for this partial cross section, conﬁrms the applicability of

the quasifree model for molecular targets.

Our demonstration, in Figs. 1 and 2, that the present total and absorption cross sections

are good also conﬁrms the quality of our integrated elastic cross sections at intermediate

energies. In Table II, we provide the values of our diﬀerential, integrated elastic, and mo-

mentum transfer cross sections at intermediate impact energies. As mentioned in sec. I, we

can also claim that the present model potential results are reliable well into the low-energy

regime. This is conﬁrmed partly by the quality of the low-energy total cross sections in Fig.

2. However, a much more stringent test is made by diﬀerential cross sections. To date, there

are no measurements of diﬀerential cross sections for positron scattering from H2. Thus, in

Fig. 4, we compare our present low-energy diﬀerential cross sections against the ab initio

calculations of Lino et al using the Schwinger multichannel method [1]. Despite the fact

that, at small scattering angles, our calculations show a slight dip, the present results show

excellent agreement with their calculations at every energy for which a comparison has been

made.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present calculations, we have presented calculations of scattering cross sections for

positrons scattered from H2. Using a single model potential approach, we have presented

accurate total cross sections through both the low- and intermediate-energy regimes correctly

9

matching the detailed structure in this curve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

ﬁrst theoretical calculation to achieve this feat. We have also demonstrated that, with a

very minor modiﬁcation, the positron quasifree absorption potential can perform equally

well, or better, for scattering in molecular gases as it has in atomic gases. Furthermore,

we have introduced a simple scheme for obtaining accurate molecular charged densities

using GAUSSIAN that can be applied to almost any molecule bypassing the need for the

independent atom model.

V. FIGURE CAPTIONS

Figure 1. Points on a plane of the conﬁguration used to generate the radial electron

charge density of H2. The two small circles present the protons in the hydrogen molecule.

The large circle represents points on the surface of a sphere of radius r. The dots represent

points at which ρ(r) is determined by GAUSSIAN and these values are used to calculate

ρ(r) at 40,000 points on the sphere by interpolation. The radial charge density is then

determined using Eq. (10).

Figure 2. The present total cross sections for the scattering of low to intermediate energy

positrons by H2 compared with several experimental measurements. The error bars are the

“maximum error” as reported by the relevant authors.

Figure 3. The present absorption cross sections for the scattering of positrons by H2

compared with experimental results. The experimental results are a summation of partial

cross section measurements from diﬀerent experiments. These partial cross sections are for

positronium formation by Zhou et al [21], ﬁrst ionization by Maxom et al [? ], and excitation
to the B1Σ state by Sullivan et al [27].

Figure 4. The present low-energy diﬀerential cross sections for the scattering of positrons

by H2 compared with the ab initio calculations of Lino et al [1]. The positron energy ranges

from 1.36 eV to 6.9 eV.

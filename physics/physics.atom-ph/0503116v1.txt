In this Comment, we address certain claims, made by Harris, Frolov, and Smith in the above
mentioned paper, as well as in other recent papers devoted to the exponential basis functions in
the Coulomb four-body problem. We also raise concerns over these authors’ inappropriate citation
practice.

The title of the paper in question [1],“New Methods
for Old Coulomb Few-Body Problems”, strongly suggests
that the methods discussed are indeed new. One of these
methods, and the only one for which “preliminary re-
sults” are reported is what the authors call the “expo-
nential ansatz” approach. However, the method of using
exponential basis functions of all six interparticle separa-
tions for direct variational solution of the Coulomb four-
body problem was implemented and successfully used by
our group a decade ago. We, therefore, begin this Com-
ment by presenting a brief history of the subject.

A general method for analytic evaluation of

four-
particle integrals was developed by Fromm and Hill in
in 1987. This
their well-known pioneering work [2]
method makes it possible to perform variational calcu-
lations of four-particle systems using exponential basis
functions of interparticle separations. Rebane showed
in 1993, that,
in order to obtain matrix elements of
a four-particle Hamiltonian with exponential functions,
one needs to compute only seven integrals: six integrals
of Coulomb interactions and one overlap integral [3]. The
ﬁrst variational calculation of the positronium molecule
e+e−e+e− in the exponential basis was carried out by
Rebane, Zotev, and Yusupov in 1996 [4]. It employed 90
symmetrized exponential functions. This work was fol-
lowed by calculations of four mesomolecules in the basis
of 240 symmetrized exponentials [5]. In 1998, the original
method by Fromm and Hill was generalized by Zotev and
Rebane to allow computation of four-particle integrals
with complex exponential parameters. This result en-
abled us to perform the ﬁrst variational calculation of the
positronium molecule and three other systems in the ba-
sis of extremely ﬂexible exponential-trigonometric func-
tions in 1998 [6]. It was shown that a single exponential-
trigonometric function is as eﬃcient as seven exponen-
tials in the case of the positronium molecule, and is
ﬂexible enough to allow eﬃcient computation of adia-
batic four-particle systems [6]. A detailed description
of our method, for both exponential and exponential-
trigonometric basis functions, was published in 2002 [7].
Thus, our research group (Rebane, Zotev, Yusupov) had
unquestionable priority in using the exponential, as well
as the exponential-trigonometric, basis for solution of the
Coulomb four-body problem.

Harris, Frolov, and Smith, in their papers on four-
particle integrals and exponential functions [8, 9], pub-
lished prior to 2003, chose not to reference our works at
all. This is despite the fact that English versions of our
papers [4, 5, 6] were available both in print and online,
and could be easily found using generally available scien-
tiﬁc search resources.

In 2003, Harris, Frolov, and Smith presented their
own approach to computation of four-particle integrals,
based on a slightly modiﬁed Fromm and Hill formalism,
and reported a calculation of the positronium molecule
in the basis of two exponential functions [10]. They
claimed that a major contribution of their work was the
implementation of a procedure for analytic cancellation
of (non-physical) termwise singularities. They also sug-
gested that, because no such procedure was used in calcu-
lations by our group, our results were not precise enough,
in terms of both numeric stability and optimization qual-
ity. This claim, which was reiterated in their more recent
papers [1, 11], is both incorrect and misleading.

While an eﬃcient procedure for analytic cancellation
of singular terms in the expression for the generating in-
tegral [2] might indeed be desirable, the problem of singu-
larities is not nearly as important as presented by Harris,
Frolov, and Smith. The reason for this is simple: there
is no need to compute an integral directly at a singular
point. Optimization of each exponential basis function is
performed in six-dimensional parameter space, and the
energy landscape is inevitably very complicated. The
optimization, therefore, is either purely stochastic, or is
started by a stochastic search, followed by a gradient de-
scent. Parameters of multiple trial functions, compared
at each step of bias expansion, can always be chosen to
avoid singularities in all the integrals to be computed.
In systems with equal or similar particle masses, all six
exponential parameters are on equal footing, so there is
great freedom in selecting their values. No basis function
is indispensable for the same reason.
If parameters of
a given function cannot be optimized precisely because
of their proximity to a singular point, this can always
be compensated by better optimization of the next basis
function.

In our ﬁrst calculations of the positronium molecule [4]
and mesomolecules [5], we used 90 and 240 exponential

2

functions, respectively. All computations were performed
with double precision, which means that no more than 15
signiﬁcant ﬁgures could be retained at any computation
step. Our results exhibited perfect numeric stability and
steady convergence. All singularities were avoided by im-
posing proper restrictions on acceptable parameter sets.
The convergence was not very fast when the basis was
expanded beyond the ﬁrst 10-20 functions, because eval-
uation of four-particle integrals is very time-consuming,
and our limited computational resources in the ’90s did
not allow us to perform any substantial optimization of
exponential parameters.

Stability and eﬃciency of the approach, used by Harris,
Frolov, and Smith [10], is yet to be demonstrated for a
large exponential basis.

In the case of the exponential-trigonometric basis func-
tions, arguments of diﬀerent terms in the formula for the
generating integral [2] are complex, and are usually well
removed from the singularities on the real axis. The pa-
rameter space of each function has 12 dimensions, allow-
ing even greater freedom in selecting parameter values.
Thus, the problem of singularities is virtually nonexistent
in practical applications of this basis.

In the paper in question [1] and other recent pa-
pers discussing the exponential basis [11, 12], Harris,

Frolov and Smith cite our 1996 article and some ear-
lier works, but do not reference any subsequent publica-
tions [5, 6, 7]. The apparent purpose of this is to cre-
ate an impression that their own work represents the
only progress in this ﬁeld since 1996. The most ad-
vanced and promising method, which uses highly ﬂexible
exponential-trigonometric functions for computations of
four-particle systems with arbitrary particle masses [6, 7],
has never been mentioned by these authors. This is de-
spite their statement in the discussed paper that “this
contribution is mainly a review of methods applicable to
few-body problems” [1].

Only by systematically avoiding to reference our most
relevant publications, can Harris, Frolov, and Smith por-
In real-
tray their own approach as a “new method”.
ity, the only practical result presented in their 2003-2004
papers [1, 10, 11] – the calculation of the positronium
molecule in the basis of two exponential functions – does
not measure up to the level of our 1996 work [4].

We consider the practice of selective and self-serving
citation, consistently employed by Harris, Frolov, and
Smith, a violation of academic ethics. The purpose of
this Comment is to draw attention of the readers, and,
especially, the Editors, to this deplorable issue.

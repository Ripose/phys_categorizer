Abstract

We present a nonperturbative numerical evaluation of the one-photon electron
self energy for hydrogenlike ions with low nuclear charge numbers Z = 1 to
5. Our calculation for the 1S state has a numerical uncertainty of 0.8 Hz for
hydrogen and 13 Hz for singly-ionized helium. Resummation and convergence
acceleration techniques that reduce the computer time by about three orders
of magnitude were employed in the calculation. The numerical results are
compared to results based on known terms in the expansion of the self energy
in powers of Z α.

Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the accuracy of experiments that measure
the transition frequencies in hydrogen and deuterium [1,2]. This progress is due in part
to the use of frequency chains that bridge the range between optical frequencies and the
microwave cesium time standard. The most accurately measured transition is the 1S-2S
frequency in hydrogen; it has been measured with a relative uncertainty of 3.4 × 10−13 or
840 Hz. With trapped hydrogen atoms, it should be feasible to observe the 1S-2S frequency
with an experimental linewidth that approaches the 1.3 Hz natural width of the 2S level
[3,4]. Indeed, it is likely that transitions in hydrogen will eventually be measured with an
uncertainty below 1 Hz [5,6].

In order for the anticipated improvement in experimental accuracy to provide better
values of the fundamental constants or better tests of QED, there must be a corresponding
improvement in the accuracy of the theory of the energy levels in hydrogen and deuterium,
particularly in the radiative corrections that constitute the Lamb shift. As a step toward a
substantial improvement of the theory, we have carried out a numerical calculation of the
one-photon self energy of the 1S state in a Coulomb ﬁeld for values of the nuclear charge
Z = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is the ﬁrst complete calculation of the self energy at low Z and provides
a result that contributes an uncertainty of about 0.8 Hz in hydrogen and deuterium. This
is a decrease in uncertainty of more than three orders of magnitude over previous results.

Among all radiative corrections, the largest by several orders of magnitude are the one-
photon self energy and vacuum polarization corrections. Of these, the larger and historically
most problematic is the self energy. Analytic calculations of the electron self energy at low
nuclear charge Z have extended over 50 years. The expansion parameter in the analytic
calculations is the strength of the external binding ﬁeld Zα. This expansion is semi-analytic
[i.e., it is an expansion in powers of Zα and ln(Zα)−2]. The leading term was calculated
in [7]. It is of the order of α (Zα)4 ln(Zα)−2 in units of me c2, where me is the mass of the
electron. In subsequent work [7–25] higher-order coeﬃcients were evaluated.

The analytic results are relevant to low-Z systems. For high Z, the complete one-
photon self energy has been calculated without expansion in Zα by numerical methods
[26–37]. However, such numerical evaluations at low nuclear charge suﬀer from severe loss
of numerical signiﬁcance at intermediate stages of the calculation and slow convergence in
the summation over angular momenta. As a consequence, the numerical calculations have
been conﬁned to higher Z.

Despite these diﬃculties, the numerical calculations at higher Z could be used together
with the power-series results to extrapolate to low Z with an assumed functional form in
order to improve the accuracy of the self energy at low Z [30]; up to the present, this approach
has provided the most accurate theoretical prediction for the one-photon self energy of the
1S state in hydrogen [38].

However, this method is not completely satisfactory. The extrapolation procedure gives
a result with an uncertainty of 1.7 kHz, but employs a necessarily incomplete analytic
approximation to the higher-order terms. It therefore contains a component of uncertainty
that is diﬃcult to reliably assess. Termination of the power series at the order of α (Zα)6
leads to an error of 27 kHz. After the inclusion of a result recently obtained in [25] for the
logarithmic term of order α (Zα)7 ln(Zα)−2 the error is still 13 kHz.

A detailed comparison between the analytic and numerical approaches has been inhibited
by the lack of accurate numerical data for low nuclear charge. The one-photon problem is

2

especially well suited for such a comparison because ﬁve terms in the Zα expansion have
been checked in independent calculations. The known terms correspond to the coeﬃcients
A41, A40, A50, A62 and A61 listed below in Eq. (3).

The energy shift ∆ESE due to the electron self energy is given by

∆ESE =

α
π

(Zα)4
n3 mec2 F (Zα) ,

(1)

where n is the principal quantum number. For a particular atomic state, the dimensionless
function F depends only on one argument, the coupling Zα. The semi-analytic expansion
of F (Zα) about Zα = 0 gives rise to the following terms:

F (Zα) = A41 ln(Zα)−2 + A40 + (Zα) A50 + (Zα)2
×hA62 ln2(Zα)−2 + A61 ln(Zα)−2 + GSE(Zα)i ,

(2)

where GSE(Zα) represents the nonperturbative self-energy remainder function. The ﬁrst
index of the A coeﬃcients gives the power of Zα [including the (Zα)4 prefactor from Eq.
(1)], the second corresponds to the power of the logarithm. For the 1S ground state, which
we investigate in this Letter, the terms A41 and A40 were obtained in [7–13]. The correction
term A50 was found in [14–16]. The higher-order corrections A62 and A61 were evaluated
and conﬁrmed in [17–21]. The results are

The Bethe logarithm ln k0 has been evaluated, e.g., in [39,40] as ln k0 = 2.984 128 555 8(3).
For our high-accuracy, numerical calculation of F (Zα), we divide the calculation into
a high- and a low-energy part (see Ref. [28]). Except for a further separation of the low-
energy part into an infrared part and a middle-energy part, which is described in [41] and
not discussed further here, we use the same integration contour for the virtual photon energy
and basic formulation as in [28].

The numerical evaluation of the radial Green function of the bound electron [see Eq.
(A.16) in [28]] requires the calculation of the Whittaker function Wκ,µ(x) (see [42], p. 296)
over a very wide range of parameters κ, µ and arguments x. Because of numerical cancella-
tions in subsequent steps of the calculation, the function W has to be evaluated to 1 part
in 1024. In a problematic intermediate region, which is given approximately by the range
15 < x < 250, we found that resummation techniques applied to the divergent asymptotic
series of the function W provide a numerically stable and eﬃcient evaluation scheme. These
techniques follow ideas outlined in [43] and are described in detail in [41].

For the acceleration of the slowly convergent angular momentum sum in the high-energy
part [see Eq. (4.3) in [29]], we use the combined nonlinear-condensation transformation [44].

3

This transformation consists of two steps: First, we apply the van Wijngaarden condensation
transformation [45] to the original series to transform the slowly convergent monotone input
series into an alternating series [46]. In the second step, the convergence of the alternating
series is accelerated by the δ transformation [see Eq. (3.14) in [44]]. The δ transformation
acts on the alternating series much more eﬀectively than on the original input series. The
highest angular momentum, characterized by the Dirac quantum number κ, included in the
present calculation is about 3 500 000. However, even in these extreme cases, evaluation of
less than 1 000 terms of the original series is required. As a result, the computer time for
the evaluation of the slowly convergent angular momentum expansion is reduced by roughly
three orders of magnitude. The convergence acceleration techniques remove the principal
numerical diﬃculties associated with the singularity of the relativistic propagators for nearly
equal radial arguments. These singularities are present in all QED eﬀects in bound systems,
irrespective of the number of photons involved. It is expected that these techniques could
lead to a similar decrease in computer time in the calculation of QED corrections involving
more than one photon.

In the present calculation, numerical results are obtained for the scaled self-energy func-
tion F (Zα) for the nuclear charges Z = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (see Table 1). The value of α used in
the calculation is α0 = 1/137.036. This is close to the current value from the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron [47],

1/α = 137.035 999 58(52) .

The numerical data points are plotted in Fig. 1, together with a graph of the function
determined by the analytically known lower-order coeﬃcients listed in Eq. (3).

In order to allow for a variation of the ﬁne-structure constant, we repeated the calculation

with two more values of α, which are

1/α> = 137.035 999 5 and 1/α< = 137.036 000 5 .

On the assumption that the main dependence of F on Zα is represented by the lower-order
terms in (3), the change in F (Zα) due to the variation in α is

∂F (Zα)

∂α

δα = −2 A41

δα
α

+ hZ A50 + O(α ln2 α)i δα

for a given nuclear charge Z. Based on this analytic estimate, we expect a variation

F (Zα>) − F (Zα0) ≈ F (Zα0) − F (Zα<) ≈ −9 × 10−9

for the diﬀerent values of α. This variation is in fact observed in our calculation. E.g., for
the case Z = 2 we ﬁnd

F (2α<) = 8.528 325 061(1) ,
F (2α0) = 8.528 325 052(1) and
F (2α>) = 8.528 325 043(1) .

This constitutes an important stability check on the numerics and it conﬁrms that the main
dependence of F on its argument is indeed given by the lowest-order analytic coeﬃcients
A41 and A50.

4

In addition to the results for F (Zα0), numerical results for the nonperturbative self-
energy remainder function GSE(Zα0) are also given in Table 1. The results for the re-
mainder function are obtained from the numerical data for F (Zα0) by direct subtraction of
the analytically known terms corresponding to the coeﬃcients A41, A40, A50, A62 and A61
[see Eqs. (2,3)]. Note that because the dependence of F on Zα is dominated by the sub-
tracted lower-order terms, we have at the current level of accuracy GSE(Zα<) = GSE(Zα0) =
GSE(Zα>). The numerical uncertainty of our calculaton is 0.8 × Z 4 Hz in frequency units.
A sensitive comparison of numerical and analytic approaches to the self energy can be
made by extrapolating the nonperturbative self-energy remainder function GSE(Zα) to the
point Zα = 0. It is expected that the function GSE(Zα) approaches a constant in the limit
Zα → 0. This constant is referred to as GSE(0) ≡ A60. In the analytic approach, much
attention has been devoted to the coeﬃcient A60 [21–24]. The correction has proven to be
diﬃcult to evaluate, and analytic work on A60 has extended over three decades. A step-by-
step comparison of the analytic calculations has not been feasible, because the approaches
to the problem have diﬀered widely. An additional diﬃculty is the isolation of terms which
contribute in a given order in Zα, i.e. the isolation of only those terms which contribute to
A60 (and not to any higher-order coeﬃcients).

In order to address the question of the consistency of A60 with our numerical results, we
perform an extrapolation of our data to the point Zα = 0. The extrapolation procedure is
adapted to the problem at hand. We ﬁt GSE to an assumed functional form which corre-
sponds to A60, A71 and A70 terms, with the coeﬃcients to be determined by the ﬁt. We ﬁnd
that our numerical data is consistent with the calculated value A60 = −30.924 15(1) [24,48].
It is diﬃcult to assess the seventh-order logarithmic term A71, because the extrapolated
value for A71 is very sensitive to possible eighth-order triple and double logarithmic terms,
which are unknown. We obtain as an approximate result A71 = 5.5(1.0), and we therefore
cannot conclusively conﬁrm the result [25]

A71 = π (cid:18)139

64

− ln 2(cid:19) = 4.65.

Since our all-order numerical evaluation eliminates the uncertainty due to higher-order terms,
we do not pursue this question any further.

The numerical data points of the function GSE(Zα) are plotted in Fig. 2 together with
the value GSE(0) = A60 = −30.924 15(1). For a determination of the Lamb shift, the
dependence of GSE on the reduced mass mr of the system has to be restored. In general,
the coeﬃcients in the analytic expansion (2) acquire a factor (mr/me)3, because of the
scaling of the wave function. Terms associated with the anomalous magnetic moment are
proportional to (mr/me)2 [49]. The nonperturbative remainder function GSE is assumed to
be approximately proportional to (mr/me)3, but this has not been proved rigorously. Work
is currently in progress to address this question [50].

We conclude with a brief summary of the results of this Letter. (i) We have obtained
accurate numerical results for the self energy at low nuclear charge. Previously, severe
numerical cancellations have been a problem for these evaluations.
(ii) For a particular
example, we have addressed the question of how well semi-analytic expansions represent
all-order results at low nuclear charge. Our numerical data is consistent with the value
A60 = −30.924 15(1) [24,48].
(iii) Numerical techniques [44] have been developed that
reduce the computer time for the problem by about three orders of magnitude.

The calculation presented here is of importance for the interpretation of measurements
in hydrogen, deuterium and singly-ionized helium and for the improvement of the Rydberg
constant, because of recent and projected progress in accuracy. In the determination of the
Rydberg constant, uncertainty due to the experimentally determined proton radius can be
eliminated by comparing the frequencies of more than one transition [2]. We have shown
that an all-order calculation can provide the required accuracy if suitable numerical methods
are used.

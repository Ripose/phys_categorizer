We provide numerically exact photoexcitation cross sections of rubidium Rydberg states in
crossed, static electric and magnetic ﬁelds, in quantitative agreement with recent experimental
results. Their spectral backbone underpins a clear transition towards the Ericson regime.

The experimental characterization and theoretical un-
derstanding of complex quantum transport phenomena is
of fundamental relevance for many, otherwise rather re-
mote research areas which exploit quantum interference
eﬀects for the purpose of an ever improving control over
the quantum dynamics of increasingly complicated sys-
tems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In such context, “complexity”
may arise from many particle interactions, from deter-
ministic chaos, or from disorder, to name just a few of
its possible causes. Notwithstanding the many origins of
complex quantum dynamics, its qualitative macroscopic
signatures are often very similar: an enhanced sensitiv-
ity on small changes in some control parameter (be it
the boundary conditions in a disordered mesoscopic con-
ductor [9], the perturbation strength in a strongly driven
atomic system [2], the injection energy in a compound nu-
cleus reaction [10], or the observation angle in a random
laser [11, 12]) enforces a statistical description such as to
isolate robust quantities to characterize the underlying
physical processes. Surprisingly, many of the resulting
predictions are universal in character, i.e., they apply to,
on a ﬁrst glance, rather diﬀerent classes of physical ob-
jects, which only share an increased density of states, and
the nonperturbative coupling of their various degrees of
freedom.

While erratic ﬂuctuations of some experimental ob-
servable under changes of a control parameter come not
too surprising in many-particle dynamics or in disordered
systems [1, 4, 9, 13], they still remain rather counterintu-
itive and for many a cause of discomfort in simple quan-
tum systems with only few degrees of freedom – think
of single electron or photon transport across two dimen-
sional billiards [14, 15, 16], or of the ionization probabil-
ity of a one electron Rydberg state under external forcing
[2, 17]. Here, classically chaotic dynamics substitute for
disorder and many-particle interactions, though are ex-
pected to generate very similar – if not the same – statis-
tical behaviour, in tantalizing contrast, e.g., to the clock-
like regularity of Kepler like Rydberg motion. Hitherto,
however, experimental evidence for chaos-induced ﬂuctu-
ations in the coherent quantum transport in low dimen-
sional, strictly deterministic systems is scarce [14], since
bona ﬁde transport measurements require very high spec-
tral resolution in the continuum part of the spectrum, to-

gether with the continuous tunability of a suitable control
parameter.

In the present Letter, we focus on a paradigmatic ex-
ample in the realm of atomic physics – the photoexci-
tation of one electron Rydberg states in the presence of
crossed, static electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Our contribu-
tion is motivated by recent experimental results [18, 19]
which probe the atomic spectrum above the ﬁeld induced
ionization saddle, and reﬁnes the interpretation of the ex-
periments as the ﬁrst observation of Ericson ﬂuctuations
in a strictly deterministic, open quantum system. Fur-
thermore, this represents the ﬁrst full-ﬂedged, parameter-
free quantum treatment of the truly three dimensional
crossed ﬁelds problem at experimentally realistic spec-
tral densities.

Ericson ﬂuctuations are a universal statistical feature
of strongly coupled, fragmenting quantum systems, ﬁrst
predicted [20] and observed [21] in compound nuclear
reactions. They manifest as ﬂuctuations in the exci-
tation cross sections into the regime of highly excited,
metastable resonance states, with typical decay widths
larger than the average level spacing, such that single
maxima in the cross section cannot be identiﬁed with
single resonances any more, but are rather due to the in-
terference of several of them. In particular, this implies
that the typical scale of ﬂuctuations induced by inter-
fering decay channels is smaller than the typical width
In quantum systems with a
of individual resonances.
well-deﬁned classical analog, Ericson ﬂuctuations can be
understood as a hallmark of chaotic scattering [22], some-
what complementary to the exponential or algebraic de-
cay of the survival probability on the time axis [23]. A
similarly paradigmatic case of the Ericson scenario as the
one to be considered presently arises in the photoexcita-
tion of highly doubly excited states of helium, yet still
awaits its full experimental conﬁrmation, due to the ex-
traordinary requirements on the experimental resolution
[24].

Let us start with the Hamiltonian describing the sin-
gle electron Rydberg dynamics subject to crossed electric
and magnetic ﬁelds, in atomic units, and assuming an in-
ﬁnite mass of the nucleus:

H =

+ Vatom(r) +

Bℓz +

B2(x2 + y2) + F x . (1)

Here, B and F are the strength of magnetic and electric
ﬁeld, respectively, and ℓz the angular momentum projec-
tion on the magnetic ﬁeld axis. Note that no uniquely
deﬁned one particle potential is available for the bare
atomic Hamiltonian with its alkali earth multielectron
core, and Vatom is therefore not given explicitely. How-
ever, the deviation of Vatom from a strictly Coulombic
potential in a small but ﬁnite volume around the nu-
cleus can be accounted for by the phase shift experi-
enced by the Rydberg electron upon scattering oﬀ the
multielectron core [25, 26]. This phase shift is ﬁxed by
the ℓ-dependent quantum defects δℓ of the unperturbed
atom, which are precisely determined by spectroscopic
data [27]. The continuum coupling induced by the elec-
tric ﬁeld (which lowers the ionization threshold by cre-
ating a Stark saddle in the x direction) is incorporated
into our theoretical treatment by complex dilation of the
Hamiltonian, and the numerical diagonalization of the
resulting complex symmetric matrix (represented in a
real Sturmian basis) immediately yields the full spectral
structure (eigenenergies Ej, decay rates Γj, and eigenvec-
tors |Eji) underlying the experimentally measured pho-
toionization cross section, without adjustable parameters
[25, 26]. Note that, due to the mixing of all good quan-
tum numbers of the unperturbed dynamics (the princi-
pal quantum number n, the angular momentum quan-
tum number L, and the angular momentum projection
M ) by the crossed external ﬁelds, we are dealing with a
truly three dimensional problem [28, 29], and the only
remaining constants of the motion are the energy E, and
parity with respect to the plane deﬁned by the magnetic
ﬁeld axis. Consequently, the complex symmetric eigen-
value problem which we have to solve has a respectable
size, with typical (sparse banded) matrix dimensions of
300000 × 4000, for the energies and ﬁeld strengths we
shall be dealing with hereafter.

The experiments in [18, 19] probe the energy range
from −57.08 cm−1 to −55.92 cm−1 (corresponding to
principal quantum numbers n ≃ 43 . . . 45 of the bare
atom), at ﬁxed electric ﬁeld strength F = 22.4 kV/m,
and for three diﬀerent values of the magnetic ﬁeld,
B = 0.9974 T, B = 1.49 T, and B = 2.0045 T. The
electric ﬁeld shifts the eﬀective ionization threshold to
−91.4 cm−1, hence the experimentally probed energy
range lies clearly in the continuum part of the spectrum.
Invoking the scale invariance of the classical dynamics
in a Coulomb potential, the speciﬁc choice of F and
B = 2.0045 T is equivalent to the one in [28] (there for
the purely Coulombic problem, and for a lower lying en-
ergy range, n ≃ 19 . . . 22, i.e., at much reduced spectral
densities), and corresponds to classically chaotic scatter-
ing (where electric and magnetic ﬁeld are of comparable
strength, though incompatible symmetry). While the ﬁ-
nite size multielectron core of rubidium strictly speaking
invalidates such a scaling argument (as well as it blurres
a strict quantum-classical analogy, simply due to the ab-
sence of a well deﬁned classical one particle analog) [26],
it may still serve as an approximate guide into the regime

We performed numerical diagonalizations of the com-
plex dilated Hamiltonian (1) precisely for the experimen-
tal parameter values, though in a broader energy range,
such as to illustrate the emergence of Ericson ﬂuctua-
tions from a smooth continuum background, with in-
creasing Rydberg energies. The photoexcitation cross
section σ(E) is readily obtained from the quantum spec-

into the electronic
eigenstate |Eji with decay rate Γj, mediated by a sin-
gle photon linearly polarized along the magnetic ﬁeld
axis (thus selecting the odd parity part of the spectrum).
Note that our computational method does not allow for
an absolute calibration of the oscillator strengths, since
the wave function of |n = 5 L = 1 M = −1i is not ex-
plicitely known. For the technical details underlying the
expression (2), we refer the reader to [25, 31].

FIG. 2: Distribution of the resonance widths Γj contributing
to the photoexcitation cross section, eq. (2), in units of the
local mean level spacing ∆ = hEj − Ej−1i, over an energy
range which spans the domain probed in the three plots of
ﬁg. 1, for the same values of F and B. The dashed line at
Γj /∆ = 1 separates isolated (Γj/∆ < 1) from overlapping
resonances (Γj /∆ > 1). Comparison with Fig. 1 shows how

ent energy ranges, −70.0 . . . − 65.0 cm−1, −65.0 . . . −
60.0 cm−1, and −60.0 . . .−55.0 cm−1. The latter of these
completely covers the experimentally probed energy in-
terval. Clearly, individual resonances can be resolved in
the two lower lying spectra, on top of an essentially ﬂat
continuum background. In contrast, the experimentally
probed energy range is characterized by a strongly ﬂuc-
tuating continuum, with only few narrow structures on
top, what immediately suggests the overlapping of an ap-
preciable part of the resonances which contribute to the
sum in eq. (2). Inspection of the underlying distribution
of resonance widths Γj along the energy axis, measured in
units of the average local level spacing ∆ = hEj − Ej−1i,
indeed comforts this picture, see Fig. 2: The weight of
large resonance widths with Γj > ∆ clearly increases as
we probe higher lying energies, and amounts to approx.
65% of all contributing resonances, in the experimentally
probed energy range. Many of the structures in σ(E) are
consequently due to the interference of decay channels
through overlapping resonances.

A close comparison of our numerical cross section in
the lower panel of Fig. 1 (and of Fig. 3 below) shows
close similarity with the experimental signal [18], though
no perfect coincidence is achieved. This, however, is
anything but surprising, precisely due to the character-

FIG. 3: Top: (Normalized) Autocorrelation functions C(∆E)
of the photoionization cross sections for magnetic ﬁeld
strengths B = 2.0045 T (full line), B = 1.49 T (dashed line),
B = 0.9974 T (dotted line), and B = 0.563 T (dash-dotted
line), at electric ﬁeld strength F = 22.4 kV/m. The corre-
sponding cross sections are shown in the subsequent panels,
with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength from top to bottom.
The characteristic correlation lengths γ of C(E) deduced from
our – parameter-free – numerical treatment, for the three
largest values of B, are in very good agreement with the ex-
perimentally reported values, see table I. Note that even for
the smallest value of B (not studied in [18]) there is a largely
ﬂuctuating continuum background, as opposed to the purely
Coulombic problem realized with hydrogen atoms [28].

istic, extreme sensitivity of quantum spectra and cross
sections with respect to tiny changes in the boundary
conditions, in the regime of classically chaotic dynam-
ics [2, 10, 14, 17]. Therefore, rather than scanning pa-
rameter space on a ﬁne mesh, to reproduce the exper-
imentally observed (but fragile!) cross section exactly
[32], we calculate the autocorrelation function C(∆E) =
h(σ(E + ∆E) − hσi)(σ(E) − hσii of σ(E), which is pre-
dicted [22] to have a Lorentzian shape with the charac-
teristic width γ, C(∆E) ∼ 1/(∆E2 + γ2), in the regime
of stronlgy overlapping resonances. The latter condition
is indeed met by all the three values of the magnetic ﬁeld
employed in the experiments in [18, 19], and Fig. 3 shows
the autocorrelation functions, together with the excita-
tion spectra from which they are deduced. γ is expected
to be a statistically robust quantity, and we veriﬁed that
its value remains unaﬀected by the sensitive parameter
dependence of σ(E) itself, within the error bars indicated.
The respective values of the characteristic widths γ are in
perfect agreement with the experimental values, as listed
in table I. In particular, also the nonmonotonous depen-
dence of γ on the magnetic ﬁeld strength B is recovered.
To complete the picture, we also display in Fig. 3 the

(within their experimental uncertainties [18]), the agreement
is perfect. In particular, also the nonmonotonous dependence
of γ on the magnetic ﬁeld strength B is recovered.

weak magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.563 T (not recorded in [18]),
where the classical dynamics of the associated Coulombic
problem is near regular, since the electric ﬁeld dominates
the dynamics [28].
In contrast, the present result for
rubidium exhibits a very similar structure as for stronger

magnetic ﬁelds, certainly due to the destruction of the
Coulomb symmetry by the multielectron core [33].

In conclusion, we revealed the spectral backbone of
experimentally observed ﬂuctuations in the photoexci-
tation probability of nonhydrogenic rubidium Rydberg
states in crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds – a
truly three dimensional, paradigmatic case of microscopic
chaotic (half) scattering. By correlating the experimen-
tally available data with the resonance spectrum of the
atom in the ﬁeld (obtained from an accurate numerical
treatment without adjustable parameters), and with the
evolution of the latter along the energy axis, we theoret-
ically/numerically prove that these experiments indeed
successfully entered the regime of Ericson ﬂuctuations,
for the ﬁrst time in a perfectly deterministic, open quan-
tum system.

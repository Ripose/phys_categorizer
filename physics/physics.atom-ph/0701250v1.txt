We report theoretical investigations of the tomographic procedure suggested by Itatani et al.
[Nature, 432 867 (2004)] for reconstructing highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) using high-
order harmonic generation (HHG). Using the limited range of harmonics from the plateau region,
we found that under the most favorable assumptions, it is still very diﬃcult to obtain accurate
HOMO wavefunction, but the symmetry of the HOMO and the internuclear separation between the
atoms can be accurately extracted, especially when lasers of longer wavelengths are used to generate
the HHG. We also considered the possible removal or relaxation of the approximations used in the
tomographic method in actual applications. We suggest that for chemical imaging, in the future it
is better to use an iterative method to locate the positions of atoms in the molecule such that the
resulting HHG best ﬁts the macroscopic HHG data, rather than by the tomographic method.

INTRODUCTION

In the microscopic world, chemical reactions and bi-
ological transformations occur on the time scale of the
order of picoseconds or less. Understanding the inter-
mediate steps of these reactions or transformations has
been the dream of physical and chemical scientists [1, 2].
While X-ray and electron diﬀraction have served well to
image the structure of large molecules, current technol-
ogy limits such tools to time resolution to tens of picosec-
ond to sub-picoseconds [3, 4], making them less suitable
for time-dependent studies. On the other hand, infrared
lasers of durations of tens to sub-ten femtoseconds are
becoming widely available today, thus it is natural to
ask whether femtosecond lasers can be used for dynamic
chemical imaging of molecules. Since the wavelength of
infrared lasers is much larger than the interatomic spac-
ings, these lasers cannot be used for diﬀraction measure-
ment directly. Nevertheless, recent experiments [5] have
shown that the shape of the highest occupied molecu-
lar orbitals (HOMO) can be revealed by measuring the
alignment-dependence of the ionization rates by sub-ten
femtosecond lasers. Similarly, limited experimental evi-
dences and theoretical calculations so far have also shown
that the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) can re-
veal the structure of molecules [6, 7, 8], including even
two-center interference [9, 10, 11]. Self-diﬀraction from
the rescattering electron following laser ionization has
also been suggested for imaging molecules [12, 13, 14].
Despite many such discussions in the literature in the
past decade, few real demonstrations have been achieved
so far.

they have reconstructed the highest occupied molecular
orbital of N2 molecules accurately using the tomographic
procedure from the measured HHG spectra. Using a
weak laser beam ﬁrst to partially align N2 molecules,
a more intense short probe pulse (30 fs) was then used
to generate high-order harmonics. The polarization di-
rection of the probe pulse was varied from parallel to
perpendicular direction with respect to the pump pulse.
The retrieved HOMO wavefunction has been shown to
be in surprisingly good agreement with the HOMO cal-
culated from the quantum chemistry code.
In a more
recent paper, taking that the HHG are generated from
a many-electron N2 molecule, it was further shown [16]
that the reconstructed wave-function records the image
of the Dyson orbital plus exchange contributions from
the inner shells.

The success of Itatani et al. has generated a lot of
interest. If it is generally applicable, it would oﬀer the
means for time-resolved dynamic chemical imaging at the
resolution of ten to sub-ten femtoseconds. However, a
number of skepticism have been raised recently [17, 18].
Rigorously speaking, in quantum mechanics, the ground
state wavefunction is not measurable alone since any
measurement would invoke ﬁnal states. The tomographic
procedure used by Itatani et al. relies on the approxima-
tion that the continuum states of the molecule in the
recombination process be represented by plane waves, an
approximation that is well known to be invalid in pho-
tochemistry, unless the continuum electron’s energy is
in the keV range. This is not the case for HHG in the
plateau region where the photons are from a few tens to
about 100 eV.

In a recent paper, Itatani et al.

[15] reported that

The starting point of Itatani et al.

is the three-step

model of high-order harmonic generation [19, 20, 21].
The harmonic yield is assumed to be given by the product
of three terms, one is the initial tunneling ionization rate,
the next is the propagation of the ionized electron, and
the third is the recombination of the electron with the ion
to emit high-order harmonics. By assuming that the ﬁrst
two steps are nearly independent of whether the target
is molecular or atomic so long they have nearly identical
ionization potentials, Itatani et al. were able to extract
the recombination dipole matrix element for individual
N2 molecules from the measured HHG in the plateau re-
gion, as well as their variation with angles. These dipole
matrix elements are then used to obtain the molecular
wavefunction using the tomographic imaging method.

Two important approximations are used in this tomo-
graphic procedure. First, the dipole moment of individ-
ual molecules in the direction parallel and perpendicular
to laser’s polarization can be obtained from the measured
macroscopic HHG. For this, they assumed that the har-
monics in the direction parallel to the laser polarization
satisﬁes complete phase matching condition. Experimen-
tally this is done by placing the gas jet after the focus
of the laser, thus eliminating the contribution to HHG
from the long trajectories [22, 23]. They did not mea-
sure HHG in the direction perpendicular to the laser’s
polarization, but the dipole moment in the perpendicu-
lar direction was assumed. In practice, if the molecules
are fully aligned, i.e., all pointing in the same direction in
space, then the measurement of macroscopic HHG in the
perpendicular direction would allow the determination
of the dipole moment in the perpendicular direction. For
molecules that are only partially aligned, such as those
aligned by a pump laser, it is not straightforward to ex-
tract the perpendicular dipole moment of each molecule
from the measured macroscopic HHG.

The second important approximation in Itatani et al.
is that the continuum wavefunctions in the recombination
dipole matrix elements can be approximated by plane
waves. This approximation is at the heart of the tomo-
graphic procedure. Implicit to this also is that the dipole
moment is available over the complete spectral range of
the harmonics. This is not so since the useful harmonics
are usually limited to the plateau region only.

In this paper we examined the assumptions used in the
tomographic procedure. We used the Lewenstein model
[21] to calculate the HHG’s for ﬁxed molecules with dif-
ferent alignment angles with respect to the laser polar-
ization. In this model, the dipole matrix element is cal-
culated using plane waves for the continuum states. We
thus take the calculated HHG from the Lewenstein model
to be the “experimental” data, and follow the procedure
of Itatani et al. to extract the “experimental” dipole ma-
trix elements. If the three-step model is exact, the “ex-
perimental” dipole matrix element thus obtained should
be identical to the “exact” theoretical ones which are cal-
culated using plane waves for the continuum states and
the HOMO for the initial state. In reality, we found that
the “experimental” dipole matrix element agrees with the

2

theoretical one only in a limited spectral range – in the
plateau region. With such a limited range, we found that
the HOMO wavefunctions derived from the tomographic
procedure to be approximate. Even though the accuracy
can be improved by using HHG generated with lasers of
longer wavelength to extend the plateau region, we were
unable to obtain accurate HOMO wavefunction.

In view of the failure in obtaining accurate HOMO
wavefunctions, we next turn to the possibility of using
HHG to extract some information on the structure of a
molecule. We note that in chemical imaging it is not es-
sential to reconstruct the wavefunction of a molecule. A
great deal is understood if the positions of the atoms in
the molecule can be determined at the intermediate time
steps. We thus ask what partial information of a molecule
can be revealed by the tomographic procedure under the
most favorable conditions assumed in our model. Using
lasers with wavelength of 1200 nm to generate plateau
harmonics from N2 and O2 molecules at diﬀerent inter-
nuclear distances, we showed that the internuclear dis-
tances obtained from the retrieved HOMO wavefunction
is good to better than a few percents. Furthermore, the
geometry and the symmetry of the HOMO, including the
nodal surfaces, can also be retrieved. Such precision is
more than adequate for dynamic chemical imaging and
warrants further test for complex molecules where the
positions of some atoms undergo large change, in pro-
cesses such as isomerization or dissociation, and where
the time scale of transformation is of the order of tens of
femtoseconds.

The rest of this paper is arranged as follows.

In
Section II we describe the theoretical methods and as-
sumptions used for the present tomographic imaging
of molecules using high-order harmonic generation of
aligned molecules by lasers. Section III presents the re-
sults of extracting HOMO wavefunctions and the inter-
nuclear separations. In Section IV we revisit the assump-
tions and address the intrinsic limitations of the tomo-
graphic imaging method. We showed that these limita-
tions are not easily removed in real applications, making
it diﬃcult to apply the tomographic method for chemical
imaging in general. In Section V, we suggest alternative
methods for imaging molecules with HHG, based on the
iterative procedure. Assuming that the HHG for a sin-
gle polyatomic molecule can be calculated accurately, the
propagation eﬀect and the eﬀect of partial alignment of
the molecules can be taken into account by the standard
methods. Thus macroscopic HHG can be calculated for
each conﬁguration of atoms in the molecule which can
then be compared to the experimentally measured HHG.
Since HHG can be generated for diﬀerent alignment an-
gles of the molecules using lasers of diﬀerent wavelengths,
an optimum atomic conﬁgurations can be derived by the
set that best ﬁts the experimental HHG. We note that
in typical chemical reactions, only a few atoms change
positions signiﬁcantly. Thus the number of parameters
that have to be determined is small. We then give ex-
amples of the isomerization of acetylene C2H2 and of hy-

drogen cyanide HCN to show the alignment dependence
of the HHG of these molecules under isomerization. In
the last Section we summarize our conclusion on the to-
mographic procedure and discuss future plan for study-
ing dynamic chemical imaging with lasers. Atomic units
m = e = ¯h = 1 are used throughout the paper, unless
otherwise indicated.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

A. The generation of HHG using Lewenstein model

In this paper, in order to generate the HHG spectra
from molecules with ﬁxed alignments, we use the Lewen-
stein model, as extended by Zhou et al. [6]. Without loss
of generality, we assume that the molecules are aligned
along x-axis in a laser ﬁeld E(t), linearly polarized on
the x-y plane with an angle θ with respect to the molec-
ular axis. The parallel component of the induced dipole
moment can be written in the form

Here d(ω, θ) =
is the transition

proximated by a plane-wave with k(ω) = (2ω)1/2; a[k(ω)]
is the amplitude of the continuum plane wave of returned
electrons; and N (θ) is the number of ions produced.
Ψ0(r; θ) represents the HOMO, rotated by angle θ (the
Euler angle between molecular axis and the laser polar-
ization direction). Note that in Eq. (3) perfect phase-
matching was assumed in the experimentally measured
spectra. This equation can be understood as a further
approximation to the three-step model [28]. In the case
of strong-ﬁeld tunneling ionization, it can be assumed
that the ionized electron wave packet depends weakly
on the molecular structure, but rather on the ionization
potential only. Thus, one can get rid of a[k(ω)] by mea-
suring the HHG from the reference atoms with the same
Ip (for N2 the reference atom is Ar, for O2 it is Xe).

From the measured HHG and ionization data one can

extract the transition dipole d(k, θ) by using formula

d(k, θ)
|
|

= N (θ)−1

dref (k)
|

|q

S(ω, θ)/Sref (ω)

(4)

with dref (k) being the transition dipole moment of the
reference atom. From Eq. (4) we can extract only the
amplitude of the dipole moment. However, it is well-
known [29] that the minimum of harmonic signal and a π
phase jump occur at the same harmonic order. Following
Itatani et al., we assume that the dipole changes sign
when its absolute value goes through a minimum close
to 0.

In this study we will start with HHG from individual
molecules which were calculated using the Lewenstein
model. This allows us to bypass the issues related to
phase matching and other macroscopic eﬀects for the
time being. Following Itatani et al. we obtain the d(ω, θ)
from Eq. (3) except replacing N 2(θ) in the equation
by N (θ) (since phase matching is not used for a single
molecule). The ionization rates N (θ) are calculated using
the molecular tunneling theory (MO-ADK) [32].

One major diﬀerence from Itatani et al. is that in our

calculations we use the dispersion relation

k =

2(ω

Ip)

q

−

(5)

with Ip being the ionization potential. The question
about including or not including Ip in Eq. (5) was dis-
cussed in a number of papers (see, for example, [30, 31]);
it is a question of how to relate the energy of the re-
colliding electron with the energy of the emitted photon.
For radiative recombination or photoionization, Eq. (5)

is the correct relation with k being the momentum of
the electron in the asymptotic region. In the Lewenstein
model the re-colliding electron does not see any potential
from the ion so k2/2 is also the kinetic energy of the elec-
tron near the nucleus. Indeed we found that the deduced
dipole moment from HHG calculated using Lewenstein
model works well only when Eq. (5) was used. In Itatani
et al., the relation k = √2ω was used, but their dipole
moment was extracted from the experiment.

From the dipole moment parallel and perpendicular to
the polarization direction, we ﬁrst rotate the two compo-
nents to the molecular frame. The wave function is then
obtained by using the Fourier slice theorem [33]. The
basic formulae for tomographic procedure

can then be used to obtain the HOMO in the molecular

In principle, the two equations (6) and (7) are equiv-
alent. In practice, however, incomplete dipole moment
data would give diﬀerent results from equations (6) and
(7). We take the results to be the mean from the two
equations.
If we do not know the symmetry of the
molecule the HHG should be measured over the whole
alignment range, from 0◦ to 180◦. For homonuclear di-
atomic molecules the symmetry allows us to consider
data from 0◦ to 90◦ only. Furthermore, from the in-
vestigation of tomographic transformations (6) and (7)
using “exact” theoretical dipole moments we found that
an angular step of ∆θ = 5◦ is good enough for extracting
the wave function accurately. Thus, instead of integra-
tion over the whole range we use the summation over the
19 angles from 0◦ to 90◦ only.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Alignment dependence of HHG for N2 and O2

In this paper, we generate HHG spectra using the
Lewenstein model, extended for molecules, as described
in Sec. II(A). In Fig. 1, we show the HHG intensities
along the direction parallel to the laser polarization for
N2. Here the molecules are assumed to be ﬁxed in space
and the directions of laser polarization are varied from
0 to 90◦ (in step of 10◦) with respect to the molecular

axis. The laser wavelength is 800 nm. Note that our
results are for single molecules and only odd harmonics
are used. For each (2n + 1)-th harmonic, we integrated
the calculated harmonic spectrum from the (2n)-th to
(2n + 2)-th harmonics. For the tomographic imaging we
need the harmonic yields in the direction perpendicular
to the laser polarization as well. Figures 2 and 3 show the
alignment dependence of some selective harmonic orders
for N2 and O2. Both polarizations are presented. For
parallel polarization, the HHG signals are peaked near
parallel alignments for N2 and about 45◦ for O2. For
perpendicular polarization, the HHG signals of N2 are
largest near 45◦.

To compare the HHG calculated here directly with
those measured by Itatani et al.
[15] is diﬃcult. Their
data are from the macroscopic medium such that prop-
agation eﬀect is included. Furthermore, the molecules
from the pump beam are only partially aligned. Nev-
ertheless by assuming phase matching and that the
molecules are fully aligned, they extracted the dipole mo-
ment of the individual molecules from the macroscopic
HHG. In Itatani et al.
the HHG in the perpendicular
direction was not measured, but maximal HHG inten-
sity near 45◦ was used implicitly [34]. This assumption
is consistent with our calculated results for N2 shown in
Fig. 2. For O2, our calculations show that the perpen-
dicular HHG intensities almost vanish near 45◦ and peak
at two intermediate angles near 30◦ and 70◦.

In reconstructing the HOMO’s, we typically use 19
alignment angles from 0 to 90◦ (in step of 5◦). This is
also the typical setup used in the experiments by Itatani
et al [15]. We found that using a ﬁner angular grid do
not improve the results.

As we will show, in order to improve the quality of the
reconstructed HOMOs, one would like to use the HHG

spectra from N2 aligned at 45◦, for 800 nm (black curves)
and 1200 nm (red curves). Clearly, the plateaus are ex-
tended to much higher harmonics. We note, however,
that one harmonic order is 1.55 eV for 800 nm laser and
1.03 eV for 1200 nm laser.

B. Extracted dipole matrix elements

Firstly we use the HHG spectra obtained in Sec. III(A)
(to be called “experimental” in the following) for N2 in
the case of 800 nm laser to extract the dipole moment
in the laboratory frame by using Eq. (4). Ar(3p) (with
Ip = 15.76 eV) is used as the reference atom, as sug-
gested by Itatani et al [15]. The data are available for 19
90◦]. These extracted “ex-
angles θ in the range of [0
−
perimental” dipole moments will be compared to those
calculated theoretically. For demonstration, in Fig. 5(a)
we show the “experimental” and theoretical results of
dx(k, θ) for the angles θ of 0◦, 30◦, 60◦ and 90◦. Simi-
lar results are shown in Fig. 6(a) for the y-component of
dipole dy(k, θ). In order to compare with the theoretical
data, we have normalized the x-component of the dipole
at k2 = 2.5 for θ = 0. The normalization factor is then
ﬁxed and used for all the other alignment angles as well
as for y-components. This normalization factor is also
used for N2 with the 1200 nm laser.

From the Figs. 5(a) and 6(a) we see that the “exper-
imental” dipoles compare well with the theoretical ones
in the range of k2 = [0.9
4.2], which is equivalent to
−
the useful range of HHG from H17 to H47 for the 800 nm
laser. The lower limit H17 is due to the inaccuracies in
the Lewenstein model for low harmonics, while the upper
limit H47 is due to the harmonic cut-oﬀ. For the 800 nm
1014 W/cm2 the cut-oﬀ position
laser and intensity of 2
is at about H35 for N2, as can also be seen in Fig. 1.

×

We can enlarge the useful region of HHG by using
longer wavelength lasers. In Figs. 5(b) and 6(b) we show
the “experimental” dipole moments in the case of 1200
nm laser with the same intensity. The useful dipole mo-
ments now cover the range k2 = [1.0
7.5], or H27 to
H113, of the 1200 nm laser. We note that the agree-
ment between the “experimental” and theoretical dipoles
appears to be better for higher plateaus. This is not en-

the HOMO of O2 has nodal surfaces. However, it will
be shown in the next section that these inaccuracies do

tirely surprising since one should expect the simple model
Eq. (3) to agree better with Lewenstein model near the
cut-oﬀ, where the contribution from single returns dom-
inates [28].

In Fig. 7 we show the extracted dipole moments for O2
molecules using the 1200 nm laser. In this case Xe(5p)
(with Ip = 12.13 eV) is chosen as the reference atom.
The normalization is done in the similar fashion as for
N2, but here we chose to normalize the y
component of
the dipole at k2 = 2.0 for θ = 45◦. We see that the results
are also comparable with the theoretical data in the range
of k2 = [1.0
7.5] corresponding to the useful range of
HHG from H25 to H109. The diﬀerence in the cut-oﬀ
positions is due to the diﬀerent ionization potentials of
N2 (15.58 eV) and O2 (12.03 eV).

It should be noted that for O2 the extracted dipole mo-
ments for the angles near 0◦ and 90◦ do not agree well
with the theoretical data. It is related to the accuracy

We next examine the retrieved wavefunction from the
extracted “experimental” dipole moment. We emphasize
that in the following the wave function is understood as
integrated over z direction (in the molecular frame) as
given in Eq. (8).
In Fig. 8(a) the contour plot for the
wavefunction of N2 obtained from the HHG by the 800
nm laser is shown. The harmonics used are from H17 to
H47. In Fig. 8(b), the wavefunction extracted from the
HHG by the 1200 nm laser is shown, using harmonics
orders from H27 to H113. The converged wavefunction
obtained from the tomographic procedure using the theo-
retical dipole moments in the large range of k2 = [0
100]
is shown in Fig. 8(c). This is exactly the ground state
molecular wavefunction used in the calculation of the
HHG. In the following we will call the HOMOs that are
obtained from the GAMESS and used to generate HHG
spectra “exact” wavefunctions.

−

By comparing the three ﬁgures in Fig. 8, we see that
the result from the 800nm is not good enough, such that
even the nodal surfaces are not reproduced. This is due to
the limited range of momentum space covered by the H17
to H47 harmonics used in the tomographic imaging. For
the 1200 nm case, the retrieved wavefunction resembles

the “exact” one quite well, in terms of the orbital shape
and the nodal surfaces. This clearly illustrates that the
tomographic procedure will work better if longer wave-
length lasers are used, such that the plateau region can
be extended over many harmonics. For more quantita-
tive comparison, we compare the wavefunctions along the
internuclear axis derived by using the various approxima-
tions. In Fig. 9, the “exact” results are compared to the
wavefunctions obtained from the 800nm and from the
1200 nm lasers. For each wavelength, we compare the
wavefunctions derived by using the dipole moments ob-
tained from the “experimental” HHG data and from the
theoretical calculations, but within the same range of k2.
Clearly the derived wavefunctions using the same range
of k2 are very close to each other. This indicates that
the dipole moment extracted using the simple three-step
model, Eq. (3), works well at least within the Lewenstein
model.

The results in Figs. 8 and 9 indicate that the to-
mographic imaging method works reasonably well when
1200 nm laser is used to generate the HHG. We test
the procedure for two additional internuclear separations,
R = 3 a.u. and R = 4 a.u. In Fig. 10 we compare the
wavefunctions retrieved from the HHG, using the same
range of HHG from H27 to H113. Comparing to the
“exact” wavefunctions, we see that the positions of the
nodal surfaces, and the symmetry of the wavefunctions,
are all quite nicely reproduced. Note that in this and the
following ﬁgure for contour plot of the wavefunctions, for
convenience, we have renormalized the wavefunctions to
1. It appears that the tomographic procedure fails to cor-
rectly reproduce the electron density distributions. This

is especially true for R = 3 and 4 a.u., where it overesti-
mates the distribution between the two nuclei. We note,
however, that this is largely due to the limited range of
harmonics available. The calculations using the theo-
retical dipoles with the same range of k (or harmonics)
indeed show the similar trend.

We further test the tomographic procedure for the O2
molecule whose HOMO has diﬀerent symmetry (πg in-
stead of σg in N2 case). We used 1200 nm laser to gen-
erate the HHG spectra. The results for the equilibrium
distance R = 2.3 and two other internuclear separations
R = 3 and 4 a.u., are shown in Fig. 11. In this case we
notice that the πg orbitals are well reproduced, and the
internuclear separations, as estimated by the distances
between the peaks along x-axis, appeared to be quite ac-
curate as well. In fact, we have tested the procedures for
R = 3.5, 4.5 and 5.0 a.u. as well. The deduced internu-
clear distances from the HHG’s are shown in Fig. 12. In
Table I, the details of the numerical results are shown.
The input R, the internuclear distance R∗ read from the
two peaks of the retrieved wavefunctions are compared.
When the large range of k2 (0 to 25 a.u.) in the theo-
retical dipoles is used in the tomographic procedure, the
internuclear separations can be extracted to better than
one percent. Using the smaller range of k2 of 1.0 to 7.5
a.u., corresponding to H25 to H109, we obtained R∗ ac-
curate to a few percents, except for the R = 2.3 case,
which is still good to about 10%.

The relatively good agreement between the retrieved
and “exact” wave-functions is not entirely surprising.
This is because Eq. (3) can be considered as an approxi-
mation to the Lewenstein model used to generate our “ex-

perimental” data. In particular, this agreement clearly
cannot be used to justify the plane-wave approximation,
since this approximation is used in both models. On the
other hand, one should keep in mind that the Lewenstein
model has been shown to be able to interpret the main
features of the measured HHG spectra for atoms and sim-
ple molecules [6, 27, 28]. We will discuss in details the
limitations of this approach in the next section.

IV.

INTRINSIC AND PRACTICAL

LIMITATIONS OF THE TOMOGRAPHIC
PROCEDURE

In this section we reexamine the assumptions made in
the tomographic procedure, following Itatani et al [15].
The starting point of the method is the Fourier slice
theorem, Eqs. (6) and (7), which gives a mathematical
identity between Ψ(x, y) and the dipole matrix elements
d(k) in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the
laser’s polarization, with the condition that the transi-
Ψ0(r)
tion dipole d(k) be given by
, i.e., the ﬁnal
i
|
continuum states be represented by plane waves. Oper-
ationally, the dipole matrix elements are to be obtained
from experiments, for example, using high-order harmon-
ics generated from aligned molecules, with laser’s polar-
ization direction varying from parallel to perpendicular,
with respect to the alignment direction of the molecules,
as carried out by Itatani et al.

We now examine the assumptions and limitations en-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countered in the practical implementation of the tomo-
graphic imaging method.

(1) Limitation of the available experimental spectral

range.

The Fourier slice theorem requires that the dipole ma-
trix elements be measured for the whole spectral range,
while the usable range from the HHG is limited to the
small plateau region. In Figs. 8-11 we show the eﬀect on
the retrieved wavefunctions if truncated spectral range is
used. For the small plateau region available from HHG
generated by 800 nm lasers, we conclude that accurate
wavefunctions cannot be obtained, but signiﬁcant im-
provement can be made if the HHG generated by 1200
nm or longer wavelengths are used. We comment that in
general by introducing a ﬁlter function, the accuracy of
the retrieved HOMO can be improved [16, 33].

(2) Limitation of the approximate three-step model
for extracting molecular transition dipoles from the mea-
sured HHG spectra.

The link between the HHG yields and the “experimen-
tal” dipole moments of an individual molecule which are
used in retrieving the molecular wavefunction of the ini-
tial state is given by Eq. (3) – an equation based on
the three-step model of the high-order harmonic gener-
ation. Eq. (3) was not derived from a rigorous HHG
theory so its validity can only be checked empirically.
In Eq. (3), propagation eﬀect was included by assuming
perfect phase matching, an approximation which will be
addressed later. Given that Eq. (3) is correct, how to
interpret the derived “experimental” dipole matrix ele-
? In Itatani et al., they interpreted it as
d(ω, θ)
ment
|
|
the dipole matrix element to be used in the Fourier slice
theorem, Eqs. (6) and (7). This amounts to approximat-
ing the “exact” continuum states of a molecule by plane
waves over the whole spectral range, a very poor approx-
imation well known from photochemistry.

In this paper, we showed that Eq. (3) is reasonably
valid for HHG generated from a single molecule if the
harmonics are calculated using the Lewenstein model, see
the comparisons in Figs. 5-7. In the Lewenstein model,
the continuum wavefunction is approximated by plane
waves, thus the “experimental” dipole matrix element
from Eq. (3) can be used directly in Eqs. (6) and (7) to
retrieve the molecular wavefunction. Does Eq. (3) permit
us to extract accurate dipole matrix elements? We do
not know yet. Even if it does, it would not help since the
tomographic procedure employs the condition that the
continuum states be represented by plane waves.

A further limit of Eq. (3) is that it gives only the ab-
solute values of the dipole matrix element. For simple
linear molecules, the dipole matrix elements are real such
that one can just change the sign whenever the absolute
value goes through a near-zero minimum, as adopted by
Itatani et al. For more complex molecules, the dipole
moments can become complex and it would be diﬃcult
to extract the phase information. As for measurement of
the relative phase of high harmonics, important progress
has been achieved recently [35, 36, 37].

9

(3) Limitations from the macroscopic eﬀects.
The high-order harmonics measured in the labora-
tory are from the coherent emission of light from many
molecules. Eq. (3) was written down under the perfect
phase matching condition, but how well is it met in actual
experimental condition, especially from partially aligned
molecules? We note that in applying Eqs. (6) and (7),
both parallel and perpendicular components of the HHG
are needed. This can be done in principle if the molecules
are fully aligned, i.e., all are pointing in a ﬁxed direction
in space. Such condition cannot be reached by the pump
laser pulse where molecules are only partially aligned.
Thus the angles between the laser’s polarization and the
molecules in the ensemble are not all the same, making
it very diﬃcult to extract the perpendicular component
of the dipole moment of the individual molecule from the
measured HHG signal. Note that for a unaligned ensem-
ble of molecules, the perpendicular component of HHG
vanishes. In Itatani et al., the molecules were assumed to
be fully aligned in the direction of the pump pulse. They
did not measure the perpendicular component of HHG,
but the perpendicular component of the dipole moment
was assumed. It turns out that the form they assumed
is very close to what we calculated using the Lewenstein
model, shown in Fig. 2(b). Note that in our present
model study we did not face the macroscopic issues since
we derived “experimental” dipole matrix elements from
HHG due to a single molecule ﬁxed in space only.

V. CHEMICAL IMAGING WITH HIGH-ORDER
HARMONIC GENERATION

A. Alternative methods of chemical imaging

In Section III.C, with our most optimistic assumptions,
we have shown that the HOMO wavefunction cannot be
accurately retrieved based on the tomographic method
since the spectral range provided by the plateau harmon-
ics is too limited. On the other hand, the symmetry of
the HOMO, and the internuclear distances between the
two atoms, are accurately reproduced from the retrieved
wavefunction, especially when lasers with longer wave-
lengths, say, 1200 nm, are used. Such information is com-
parable to what one can obtain from electron or X-ray
diﬀraction experiments. On the other hand, since HHG
can be generated with femtosecond lasers of duration of
the order of 10 fs or less, the retrieval of even such limited
information can be very useful in probing the time depen-
dence of a chemical transformation at time resolution of
the order of tens to sub-ten femtoseconds. Thus further
investigations of possible dynamic chemical imaging with
HHG by femtosecond lasers are warranted.

In the future, however, we believe that dynamic chem-
ical imaging be developed along a diﬀerent route. As dis-
cussed in Section IV, the steps involved in obtaining sin-
gle molecule dipole moments from the macroscopic HHG
rely on many assumptions which are diﬃcult to remove.

At present, we suggest that dynamic chemical imaging
with HHG be proceeded as follows. We assume that the
initial conﬁguration of the molecule in the ground state
is known from the conventional imaging method. Experi-
mentally the alignment dependent HHG from the ground
state of such a molecule will ﬁrst be measured, and the-
oretical calculations be performed to make sure that the
experimental data at this initial conﬁguration are well
described. Under chemical transformation, our goal is to
locate the positions of the atoms as they change in time,
by measuring their HHG spectra at diﬀerent time delays,
following the initiation of the reaction. Assuming that
such HHG data are available experimentally, the task of
dynamic chemical imaging is to ﬁnd ways to extract the
intermediate positions of all the atoms during the trans-
formation, and in particular, to identify the important
transition states of the reaction. This will be done by
the iterative method.

In the iterative method, we will ﬁrst make a guess on
the new positions of all the atoms in the molecule. A
good guess is to follow the reaction coordinates along
the path where the potential surfaces have the local min-
imum. Existing quantum chemistry codes (see, for ex-
ample, Ref. [24, 38]) provide good guidance as a start-
ing point. For each initial guess the HHG from single
molecules will be calculated. Then the propagation eﬀect
and the alignment of molecules are taken into account.
The resulting macroscopic HHG are then compared to
the experimental data to ﬁnd atomic conﬁgurations that
best ﬁt the experimental data. Recall that for each time
delay, the harmonics can be measured for many diﬀerent
angles between the aligning laser and the probe laser.
Diﬀerent wavelengths of the lasers can also be used. At
present, we believe that HHG be measured along the
probe laser’s polarization direction only, since the per-
pendicular component tends to be severely averaged out
when molecules are only partially aligned. In principle,
the phase of each harmonic can also be measured exper-
imentally [37]. For the chemical imaging purpose, how-
ever, we think it is easier to use diﬀerent wavelengths
to generate the larger data set for retrieving the atomic
conﬁgurations instead. We mention that the best ﬁtting
criterion of the iterative method is still to be developed,
but at least one can start with the genetic algorithm [40].
For the methods suggested above to work, a relatively
accurate and eﬃcient theoretical model for calculating
HHG from single molecules is needed. Direct solution of
the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for molecules
in a laser ﬁeld, even within the single active electron
model is out of questions. On the other hand, a model
such as the Lewenstein model is very eﬃcient.
It is
straightforward to include the propagation eﬀect and the
anisotropic distributions of molecules. Thus if the macro-
scopic HHG’s can be calculated eﬃciently with reason-
able accuracy, the large set of experimental HHG data
can then be analyzed to retrieve the atomic conﬁgura-
tions at each time step eﬃciently. We emphasize that in
this iterative procedure, the number of parameters that

10

are to be determined is small since only the positions of
the atoms that undergo large changes are to be deter-
mined.

We summarize that with this method, there are a num-
ber of advantages over the tomographic method: (1) No
need to assume that the continuum states be (incorrectly)
represented by plane waves; (2) No obvious need to mea-
sure HHG along both the parallel and the perpendicular
directions.
(3) The method is based on a ﬁtting pro-
cedure, not a Fourier transformation, such that limited
spectral range like the plateau harmonics may be ade-
quate. For the tomographic method the whole spectral
range is needed. (4) The propagation and the alignment
eﬀect of the molecules can straightforwardly be incorpo-
rated in the ﬁtting process.

B. Outlook of chemical imaging with HHG

The method we have suggested above for chemical
imaging formally requires an accurate and eﬃcient the-
oretical method for calculating the HHG of a complex
molecule.
In a chemical reaction involving “complex”
molecules, normally only a few atoms make large change
in positions. Such changes often modify the HOMO’s sig-
niﬁcantly since the symmetry of the molecule is altered,
resulting in signiﬁcant change in the alignment depen-
dence of the HHG. We note that such changes are typ-
ically accounted for by the Lewenstein model already.
Thus even before a more accurate theory of HHG be-
comes available, the procedure outlined in the previous
subsection can be tested at least qualitatively.

As an example, consider the isomerization of acetylene
to vinylidene [41, 42, 43]. We have calculated the simpli-
ﬁed possible reaction path of the isomerization by using
density functional theory [44] with the hybrid exchange-
correlation functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof
(PBE1PBE) [45] and Dunning’s correlation consistent
basis set AUG-cc-pVTZ [38]. It is in excellent agreement
with Ref. [43]. This path involves the well-known transi-
tion state TS2 [42]. To reach TS2 from acetylene, at least
about 2 eV is needed. Before reaching the vinylidene
there is one additional local minimum (LM2) and one
additional transition state (TS1) in the potential surface.
The positions of the atoms and the shape of the HOMO
for each of these special conﬁgurations are shown in the
ﬁgure. Note that the binding energy and the HOMO
for acetylene is very diﬀerent from the other four. Such
diﬀerences can be easily revealed from the “alignment”
dependence of HHG. In Fig. 13 we show the HHG cal-
culated for these diﬀerent isomers. The alignment angle
is deﬁned to be between the C-C axis and the laser po-
larization direction. Except for the linear acetylene, the
HHG for the other planar molecules should depend on
the φ angle which is between the plane of the molecule
and the plane of the C-C axis and the laser’s polariza-
tion. In Fig. 13, this φ-dependence has been integrated
over.

The results in Fig. 13 illustrates the potential and
the limitations of using the HHG for imaging molecules.
While it is relatively easy to identify acetylene from
vinylidene by the alignment dependence of the HHG
yields, it is diﬃcult to distinguish vinylidene from other
transient molecules, TS1, TS2 and LM2. Although the
atomic arrangements for TS2, LM2 and TS1 are quite dif-
ferent from vinylidene, major features of the HOMO from
each of these “molecules” are relatively similar. Since the
HHG, at least within the simplest model, is generated
from the HOMO only, it is to be understood as a probe
of the highest occupied molecular orbital, rather than
a probe of the positions of the atoms in the molecule,
as from the diﬀraction method. Thus, in a way, imag-
ing by HHG is more similar to (e,2e) momentum spec-
troscopy [46, 47]. While it may be possible to use HHG to
distinguish vinylidene from TS2, LM2 and TS1, by care-
fully analyzing the dependence of HHG on the alignment
angle θ and the azimuthal angle φ, or by using lasers with
diﬀerent wavelengths, the procedure is likely much more
demanding. On the other hand, in a typical reaction, a
vibrational wave packet is created. Since the potential
surfaces of these four states are quite close to each other,
unique identiﬁcation of the atomic conﬁgurations of these
four isomers as stationary states may be an oversimpli-
ﬁcation. Nevertheless, other imaging methods would be
needed to map out the full evolution from acetylene to
vinylidene. The transformation away from the acetylene,
on the other hand, would be very easy to identify using
the HHG.

Before closing, we oﬀer one more example – the isomer-
ization of hydrogen cyanide HCN to hydrogen isocyanide
HNC [48]. We have calculated the local potential min-
ima, the shape of the HOMO, the atomic conﬁgurations,
and the contour plot of the potential energy surface cal-
culated by using DFT [44] with Becke’s three parame-
ter hybrid functional B3LYP [49] and 6-311+G(2df,2pd)
Gaussian-type basis set [38]. The latter provides infor-
mation on the reaction path from the linear HCN to the
linear HNC, via a transition state of a coplanar molecule
as sketched. A fair large energy of 2.1 eV is needed to
reach the transition state. Note that the HOMO’s for
the three “molecules” are rather diﬀerent, and these dif-
ferences are easily revealed from the large diﬀerence in
the alignment dependence of the HHG yields shown in
Fig. 14, calculated again using the Lewenstein model.
Imaging the transition from HCN to HNC via the tran-
sition state using the HHG would appear to be much
simpler in this case. (We comment that in this exam-
ple, Coulomb explosion technique probably would be the
easiest since there are only three atoms in the system.)

In the discussion so far, the molecules have been as-
sumed to be stationary with its major axis making an
angle θ with respect to the laser polarization. Linear
molecules can be aligned by a short linear-polarized laser,
or oriented in a combined DC ﬁeld and a laser [50]. For
more complex molecules, they can be oriented with a
elliptically polarized laser pulse [39]. Clearly the orien-

tation and alignment of the molecules itself is a chal-
lenging subject on its own. With the rapid progress
of laser technology, we are optimistic that HHG from
aligned and/or oriented molecules will become available
for dynamic imaging in the coming years.

VI. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this paper we examined the theoretical basis of the
tomographic method used by Itatani et al. [15]. Due to
the limited spectral range provided by the high order
harmonics in the plateau region, we show that intrin-
sically it is very diﬃcult to reconstruct accurately the
wavefunction of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) from the measured high order harmonics, but
the symmetry of the HOMO and the internuclear sep-
aration can indeed be adequately obtained. The tomo-
graphic method relies on extracting the dipole moment of
individual molecules from the HHG measured in a macro-
scopic medium, and that the continuum wavefunctions in
the dipole moment of a molecule be represented by plane
waves. The former posts many practical diﬃculties owing
to the macroscopic propagation eﬀect and the imperfect
alignment of molecules in the laser ﬁeld. For the latter,
representing continuum wavefunctions of a molecule by
plane waves is a drastic simpliﬁcation. These limitations
pose severe obstacles in any attempt to improve the to-
mographic imaging of molecules.

In spite of these limitations, we showed that useful in-
formation on the molecule, in particular, the nature of
the HOMO and the position of the atoms in a transient
molecule, can be extracted from the measured HHG’s.
In view of the limitations of the tomographic method, we
have proposed an iterative approach to extract such in-
formation in the future. The method relies on an eﬃcient
and relatively accurate theoretical model for calculating
HHG from molecules. With the availability of such a the-
ory, the propagation eﬀect and other macroscopic eﬀects
can be modelled to generate HHG that can be compared

12

to the measured data. However, such a simple theory
for the HHG by molecules is not yet available today. On
the other hand, the alignment dependence of the HHG
emission is very sensitive to the nature of the HOMO.
If the HOMO changes signiﬁcantly when the molecule
undergoes transformation, for example, in isomerization,
then the HHG yield would reveal the changes eﬃciently.
Using HHG calculated from the Lewenstein model for
the isomerization of C2H2 and of HCN, we showed that
dynamic chemical imaging with HHG is likely possible
even without detailed quantitative iterative procedures
outlined in Section V.

Still many challenges remain for dynamic chemical
imaging with lasers. Theoretically it is imperative that
a simple and accurate theory of HHG from molecules
be developed. Experimentally, techniques for eﬃciently
aligning molecules with lasers are needed. Since the
HHG yield from each molecule is small, the fraction of
molecules that undergo chemical transformation should
be large within the target volume. Because HHG can also
be generated from the unexcited ground-state molecules,
the intensity of the probe lasers should be selected ap-
propriately. One advantage of using HHG for chemical
imaging is that it actually probes the HOMO instead of
the atomic positions of the whole molecule, thus it is
much more directly relevant to chemical transformation
since it is the change of the outermost electron orbital
that dictates chemical reactions.

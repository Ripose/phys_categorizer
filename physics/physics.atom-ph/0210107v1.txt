We predict theoretically and demonstrate experimentally an ellipticity-dependent nonlinear
magneto-optic rotation of elliptically-polarized light propagating in a coherent atomic medium. We
show that this eﬀect results from a hexadecapole and higher order momenta of atomic coherence, and
is associated with an enhancement of Kerr and higher orders nonlinearities accompanied by suppres-
sion of the other linear and nonlinear susceptibility terms of the medium. These nonlinearities might
be useful for quantum signal processing. In particular, we report an observation of an enhancement
the polarization rotation of elliptically polarized light resonant with the 5S1/2F = 2 → 5P1/2F = 1
transition of 87Rb.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear magneto-optic rotation (NMOR) of the po-
larization plane of light resonant with atomic transitions
has been attracting growing attention [1, 2]. Ultranar-
row (up to 1 Hz [3, 4]) spectral features accompanied
by strong polarization rotation observed in NMOR ex-
periments are used (or proposed to be used) in sensitive
magnetometery [5, 6, 7], in time-reversal-invariance vio-
lation experiments [8, 9, 10], in measurements of electron
dipole moment [11, 12], and in measurements of various
atomic constants [13]. Extremely slow propagation of po-
larization light waves also based on NMOR was observed
in hot rubidium vapor [14].

The most accurate description of the properties of
NMOR signals is obtained from an analysis of density
matrix equations for atomic polarizations and popula-
tions along with Maxwell equations describing propaga-
tion of elecromagnetic ﬁelds in the atomic medium. The
exact solution of this problem, however, is very compli-
cated, and for most cases may be acquired only numeri-
cally. The problem should be somehow simpliﬁed to ob-
tain analytical results.

The traditional approach to solution of the problem
is based on the approximation of weak electromagnetic
ﬁelds and low atomic vapor densities
[15, 16, 17, 18],
which is rooted in early experiments involving incoher-
ent radiation of atomic discharge lamps. In this case one
can use a perturbation theory, and the atomic suscep-
tibility may be decomposed in series by electromagnetic
ﬁelds involved. Magnetic ﬁeld dependent terms of the
susceptibility decomposition, nonlinear in the elecromag-
netic ﬁelds, are responsible for NMOR. It can be demon-
strated that only two-photon processes are important in
this approximation, and, therefore, complicated multi-
level systems may be reduced to systems with small level

number (Λ, V , or X) [17, 19, 20]. In this approximation
NMOR is a consequence of low frequency ground-state
coherence formed by two-photon processes between Zee-
man sublevels with diﬀerence in magnetic numbers equal
to ∆m =

2.

±

In some cases it is convenient to describe the atom-
light interaction from the point of view of light-induced
multipole moments of the atomic electron distribution.
Conventionally this is done in terms of irreducible ten-
sor representation of density matrix [21, 22, 23].
In
this case the ground-state coherence is equivalent to the
quadrupole moment or alignment. It was suggested that
NMOR is a consequence of the alignment to orientation
conversion [24], where the orientation is equivalent to the
population diﬀerence between nearest Zeeman sublevels
with ∆m =

2.

The simpliﬁed theoretical approaches used for weak
electromagnetic ﬁelds generally fail for strong ones. The
question that arises here is if the interaction with strong
ﬁelds bring new physics, e.g. if the higher order atomic
coherences inﬂuence NMOR. Alkali atoms have level
structure which allows for a formation of the coherent
superposition of the magnetic sublevels with ∆m =
4
(hexadecopole moment in the multipole decomposition
of the interaction process) and even higher. Such coher-
ences should be excited by multiphoton processes that
include four or more photons. Gawlik et.al. [25] observed
a strong narrow features in the forward scattering exper-
iment with free sodium atoms, which he attributed to a
hexadecopole moment. However, the subsequent work of
Giraud-Cotton et.al.
[15] and other groups [17, 19, 20]
demonstrated that these features may be explained us-
ing third-order perturbation theory which includes only
quadrupole moments.

±

There has been a number of the publications where the
observation of the hexadecapole and higher order mo-
ments is reported for the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to the light propagation direction [26, 27]; at the same
time the question of their inﬂuence on forward scattering
and NMOR signals in Faraday conﬁguration is still open

[28]. Generally, the interpretation of the experimental
results in the case of strong laser ﬁeld and large angular
moments is very complicated. The high-order coherence
causes only slight modiﬁcations of the rotation caused
by the quadrupole moment, which hinder the convincing
demonstration of these high-order eﬀects.

We here solve both analytically and numerically the
problem of the propagation of strong elliptically polar-
ized electro-magnetic ﬁeld through the resonant atomic
media in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld. We particularly
investigate the properties of the light which interacts with
the magnetic sublevels in M-like level conﬁguration and,
therefore, forms the coherence with ∆m = 4. We demon-
strate that this coherence is responsible for the new type
of polarization rotation which depends on both light ellip-
ticity and applied magnetic ﬁeld. We observe this eﬀect
in hot vapor of rubidium atoms. Since such rotation does
not appear for an isolated Λ scheme, our experiment may
be treated as a clear demonstration of the hexadecapole
moment of atoms.

Another interesting and important feature of the sys-
tem under consideration is connected with a large Kerr
nonlinearity that is associated with the NMOR. We an-
alyze Kerr nonlinearity in the M level conﬁguration and
show that the ratio between the nonlinearity and the ab-
sorption may be large enough. Moreover, we show that
by increasing the number of Zeeman sublevels (e.g. by
using another Rb isotope or diﬀerent alkali atom with
higher ground-state angular momentum) it is possible to
realize higher orders of nonlinearities. Our method of
creation of the highly nonlinear medium with small ab-
sorption has prospects in fundamental as well as applied
physics. It can be used for construction of nonclassical
states of light as well as coherent processing of quantum
information [29].

To make bridges between this and previous studies we
should note that NMOR may be attributed to Coherent
Population Trapping (CPT) [30, 31] and Electromagnet-
ically Induced Transparency (EIT) [32]. EIT and CPT
are able to suppress linear absorption of resonant mul-
tilevel media, keeping nonlinear susceptibility at a very
high level [33, 34, 35]. These works were devoted to the-
oretical studies of coherent media with large optical Kerr
nonlinearities that results in either eﬀective self-action of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld on a single photon energy level,
such as a photon blockade [36, 37, 38, 39], or an eﬀective
interaction between two electromagnetic ﬁelds due to re-
fractive [34, 35, 40, 41] and absorptive [42] Kerr nonlin-
earities. The absorptive χ(3) nonlinearity were studied
It was
experimentally for quasiclassical cases [43, 44].
shown quite recently, that similar approach may lead to
achievement of even higher orders of nonlinearity [45].

A method of producing Kerr nonlinearity with van-
ishing absorption is based on the coherent properties of

scheme the eﬀect of EIT can be observed. Two optical
ﬁelds, α1 and Ω1, resonant with the transitions of the
Λ system, propagates through the medium without ab-

2

sorption. However, because an ideal EIT medium does
not interact with the light, it also can not lead to any
nonlinear eﬀects at the point of exact transparency [31].
To get a nonlinear interaction in the coherent medium
one needs to ”disturb” the EIT regime by introducing,
for example, additional oﬀ-resonant level(s) (level a2 in
Fig. 1b). In the following we call the resultant level con-
ﬁguration as N -type scheme. Such scheme has been used
in the previous works [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41]. If the
disturbance of EIT is small, i.e., detuning ∆ is large, the
absorption does not increase signiﬁcantly. At the same
time, the nonlinearity can be as strong as the nonlinearity
in a near-resonant two level system.

Our present proposal is based on the existence of CPT
in multilevel media. Unlike to the early ideas of Kerr non-
linearity enhancement, we propose to use not a single Λ
scheme, but several coupled Λ schemes. We consider M -
type conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 1c. There is coherent
population trapping in such a scheme, like in a Λ-type
level system.

By introducing a small detuning, δ, we may disturb
this CPT and produce a strong nonlinear coupling among
the electromagnetic ﬁelds interacting with the atomic
system, while having small absorption of the ﬁelds [46].
The dispersion of the M level media and associated group
velocity of light propagating in the media are intensity
dependent due to the nonlinearity, as was theoretically
predicted by A. Greentree et. al.
[47]. Finally, in the
case discussed below energy levels of M conﬁguration
correspond to Zeeman sublevels of alkali atoms. The
multi-photon detuning is introduced by a magnetic ﬁeld,
resulting in the intensity dependent polarization rotation.
We show a simple way of reduction of a ﬁve-level M
conﬁguration to a four-level N conﬁguration and prove
that these completely diﬀerent schemes demonstrate re-
fractive nonlinearities of the same magnitude. It is inter-
esting to note, because the nonlinearity of M conﬁgura-
tion is, in situ, a consequence of the hexadecopole part
of atomic coherence, while in N conﬁguration the non-
linearity results from quadrupole atomic coherence.

Our paper is organized as follows. In section II we ana-
F ′ = 0 atomic transition, demonstrate that
lyze F = 1
this transition may be described by Λ level conﬁguration,
and show that the polarization rotation in the case of Λ
conﬁguration does not depend on the light ellipticity. In

tion, show that it consists of Λ and M schemes, investi-
gate properties of M interaction scheme, and show that
ellipticity dependent NMOR is possible. Using analyti-
cal calculations we show that the hexadecopole moment
plays an important role here. In section IV we expand
our theory on the case of generalized M energy level sys-
tems and discuss possibilities of observations of χ(5) and
higher order nonlinearities. In section V we discuss ap-
plications of the nonlinearities for quantum information
processing. The case of Doppler broadened Λ, M and
N systems is considered in section V I for the particular
case of weak probe ﬁeld. We present experimental mea-

surements of the polarization dependent NMOR in hot
Rb87 and Rb85 atomic vapors in section V II. Finally,
in section V III, we discuss our results and and conclude
the study.

II. ANALYSIS OF NMOR IN CASE OF

′

A three-level Λ conﬁguration is the simplest system
that results in NMOR. This system has a natural anal-
ogy in the conﬁguration of Zeeman sublevels of F = 1
→
F ′ = 0 atomic transition, where F and F ′ are the to-
tal quantum moments of the ground and excited atomic
states respectively. This analogy can be easily seen if
the angular momentum quantization axis is chosen along
the light propagation direction. The eﬀective interaction
scheme for this case is shown in Fig. 2a. The Λ conﬁgu-
ration consists of two circularly polarized components of
the laser ﬁeld, which create the low-frequency coherence
between magnetic sublevels m =
1. Because of the se-
lection rules the electromagnetic waves do not interact
with the sublevel having m = 0.

For zero magnetic ﬁeld such a conﬁguration demon-

coherent population trapping phenomenon.
Nonzero magnetic ﬁeld, collinear with the wave vector
of the light, leads to Zeeman shift of magnetic sublevels

rotation emerges as a consequence of this interaction.

In the following Section we brieﬂy review the basic
properties of CPT in Λ systems and calculate optical
losses and the polarization rotation solving optical Bloch
equations for the density matrix elements. Finally, we

is called a “dark state” because
The state denoted as
atom in this state does not interact with the light ﬁelds
and, therefore, does not show any ﬂuorescence. Atom
in the other two states, “bright states”, readily absorbs
light; therefore, atoms initially prepared in a bright state
are optically pumped into the dark state after some ﬁnite
time comparable with lifetime of excited level
. Thus,

in the steady-state, the atomic ensemble does not interact
with the electro-magnetic ﬁelds, which is the essence of
CPT. The dispersive properties of the atomic system in

It is possible to obtain the equation of motion for
the electro-magnetic ﬁelds, using the method reported
in Ref. [45, 46]. If we assume the small disturbance of
CPT, almost all atomic population remains in a dark
state during the interaction process, and we can rewrite
the interaction Hamiltonian as

Eq. (12) is suitable for describing the phase evolution
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. However the decay pro-
cesses, responsible for the optical losses, cannot be cor-
rectly included in this method and we need a density
matrix approach. In the following section we explicitly
calculate the density matrix elements for Λ system to
verify Eq.(12) and discuss the light attenuation.

In order to discuss a realistic model of atom-ﬁeld inter-
action in vacuum atomic cell, we need to include atomic
level decay rates (Fig. 2b). We introduce the decay rate
γ0 outside of the system that is inversely proportional to
the ﬁnite interaction time of the atoms and electromag-
netic ﬁeld. This decay represent the atoms leaving the
interaction region. Another term that describes decay
to outside levels, ˜γr, stands for description of popula-
tion pumping into states that do not interact with the
ﬁelds, for example, the state with zero magnetic moment
(m = 0 in Fig. 2a). The natural decay rate from level
a
|
to levels

is denoted as γr.
We also need to take into account the atoms enter-
ing the laser beam. To do that the equal incoherent
pump to all Zeeman sublevels from outside of the sys-
tem should be introduced, which means that atoms, that
enter the interaction region, have the same populations
of the ground state sublevels and no coherence between
them. The value of the incoherent pumping rate, γ0/2,
is chosen to keep the sum of level populations equal to
= 0, the sum of
unity in the case of ˜γr = 0. When ˜γr 6
the populations is less then unity because of the optical
pumping, i.e.,

It is important to note that this expression for the po-
larization, obtained in open Λ system, coincides with the
analogous expression, calculated by Fleischhauer et. al.
[5] for the closed system, if the ground-state coherence
decay rate and the population exchange rate between
ground states are the same and equal to γ0. This proves
the equivalence of the open and closed models for the
description of the Λ schemes, which has been previously
demonstrated by Lee et. al.
[49] for the particular case
of a weak probe ﬁeld.

The correspondence between the F = 1

scheme (Figs. 2a) and Λ scheme (Fig. 2b) can be obtained
if we exchange γr by γaa/3, where γaa is the decay rate
of the excited state to the ground state. The decay rate
˜γr should be presented as ˜γr = γaa/3 + ˜γaa, where ˜γaa
stands for the decay of the excited state outside of the
system in Fig. 2a.

We assume that incoherent pumping rate into each
Zeeman ground state is equal to γ0/3, to keep normal-

where ˜ρaa is the population of the excited state and ρii is

and
by the decay outside of the system we write rate equation

III. ANALYSIS OF NMOR IN CASE OF

F = 2 → F

= 1 TRANSITION

′

In case the angular momentum of the ground atomic
state is higher than F = 1, it becomes possible to cre-
ate more than one Λ link between magnetic sublevels.
This is equivalent to the creation of the coherent atomic
states characterized by higher angular momenta, which
may drastically change the interaction of such medium
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

→

Let us concentrate ﬁrst on the case of F = 2

F ′ = 1
transition, which is realized, for example, in 87Rb atoms.
The case of higher angular momenta is discussed in the
Interaction of elliptically polarized light
next section.
F ′ = 1 transition may be decomposed into

as is presented on Fig. 3a. The main diﬀerence of an M
scheme from a Λ is that the coherence of higher order
(∆m = 4) becomes important. Since the Λ system had
been studied in the previous section, here we primarily
concentrate on M scheme.

The M scheme is described by a set of twelve density
matrix equations, the straightforward solution of which
can be obtained only numerically. However, if we study
the atomic interactions with weak magnetic ﬁelds, the
decay processes and polarization rotation processes are
independent, as we saw for the Λ conﬁguration. Thus,
the polarization rotation may be found in analytical form
under condition of zero relaxations using the Hamilto-
nian diagonalization procedure as presented for Λ sys-
tem. Modiﬁed Schr¨odinger equation model is suited for
this as well. The optical losses may be found separately
by considering the optical pumping into the dark state
with zero magnetic ﬁeld.

A. Coherent population trapping in M level scheme

It was previously shown that the dark state ex-
ists even for atoms with complicated Zeeman substruc-
ture interacting with the elliptically polarized light ﬁeld
[51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. Here we recall the analytical ex-
pressions for this dark state and the corresponding eigen-
values. Using eﬀective interaction Hamiltonian we de-
rive propagation equations for the electromagnetic ﬁelds.
We restrict our consideration to the case relevant to M
conﬁguration consisting of Zeeman energy sublevels in
the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., assume that the atomic tran-
sition frequencies are such that ωa−b0 = ωa+b0 = ω,
2δ, and ωa+b+ = ω + 2δ, where the detun-
ωa−b− = ω
ing δ is due to a Zeeman shift, and the laser frequency ν
is resonant with the atomic transition. The interaction

It is worth noting that, similar to Λ system, the non-
vanishing low frequency coherences ρb+b0 and ρb0b− are
important here. The major diﬀerence in the dispersive
properties of M scheme and Λ scheme arises from the
existence of the four-photon coherence ρb+b−:

In what follows we derive the same equation using more
rigorous modiﬁed Schr¨odinger formalism [57].

B. Solution based on the modiﬁed Schr¨odinger
equations

The interaction of the four electromagnetic ﬁelds with
M energy level conﬁguration, described above, may be
also studied using Schr¨odinger equations. This approach
enables us to ﬁnd exact expressions for all the atomic
observables when we can ignore spontaneous emission.

In the steady state regime, this system has nontrivial
solution only for δ = 0. The solutions for nonzero detun-
ings correspond to zero amplitudes for all parameters. To
sustain steady state in the open system, external pump-
ing is necessary. For a small splitting between ground
state levels ¯hδ
kT , where T is the temperature of
the vapor, we assume that in thermal equilibrium, i.e.,
in the absence of all ﬁelds, all lower states

are equally populated. And, therefore, within the open-
system approach, we assume that the atoms are pumped
into states
with equal probability from
b0i

outside of the system. The corresponding rate can be
determined by the requirement that the total probability
to ﬁnd an atom in any of the states is unity.

A straightforward introduction of incoherent pumping
into the ground states of the system, as it can be done for
the density matrix approach, is impossible. It was shown
by Fleischhauer [57] in an elegant way that the eﬀective
density matrix equations for open systems with injection
rates into states and decays out of states can be written
in terms of stochastic complex state amplitudes.

Let us consider an eﬀective density matrix equation
for an atomic ensemble undergoing a unitary interaction
with some external ﬁelds or potentials. In addition decay
out of atomic states
is taken into account with rates
γj. Also injection into certain states is considered with

injection rates Rij. In our case the injection occurs only
into energy eigenstates of the atoms or incoherent mix-
tures of them, so only diagonal elements of the matrix
Rij are nonzero. If injection in the coherent superposi-
tion states is considered, non-diagonal elements are also
required to be taken into account.

An eﬀective density matrix equation has the following

γi are decay rates out of the system, which can in gen-

rates Rij are time dependent. For the sake of simplicity,
however, in the following consideration we assume that
rates Rij are constant.

Element of density matrix may be represented in terms

This yields a set of amplitude equations with stochastic

Since the amplitude equations are linear, their solution
will be a linear functional of the stochastic pump rates

required to obtain the density matrix elements can easily
be performed. Generally, solution cj of Eq.(55) no longer
makes sense as the amplitude for the atomic wave func-
tion. It only determines density matrix elements of the
system.

So far we have made no assumption concerning the
losses in the system. Generally, it requires solving the
Bloch equations for the atomic populations and polar-
izations, like it was done for Λ system. For M scheme,
however, this process is rather involved even for the de-
generate system (δ = 0). Since the dark state exists for
any value of Rabi frequency Ωij, it is always possible to
transform the basis of the atomic states so that there is
one atomic level uncoupled from the laser ﬁeld. M sys-
tem can be represented as two independent open two-
level systems, connected only via relaxation processes
[58]. The absorption is this systems has similar prop-
erties compared to those of the Λ system:
it is propor-
tional to decay rate γ0 and inversely proportional to the

light intensity. The exact analytical expression for this

schemes. Using the numerical simulation of this system,
we ﬁnd them to be equal with very good accuracy. Using

system is in a dark state and the density matrix elements
correspond to the elements generated by Eq. (39). For a
nonzero small two-photon detuning the populations and
coherences for the ground state stay approximately un-

It is obvious that both interaction chains contribute to
the elliptically dependent NMOR. At the same time the
diﬀerent orders of the nonlinear susceptibility are respon-
sible for the polarization rotation: if in the case of the M
scheme it is χ(3) nonlinearity, for the triple-Λ scheme it
is χ(5) nonlinearity, since there are 7 photons involved in
the creation of the ground-state coherence. That might
be the reason why the enhancement of the rotation for
a nearly circular polarization compared to the rotation
of linear polarization is bigger for triple-Λ scheme com-
pared with the M scheme (10 vs 20/9 times for the
F = 3

F ′ = 2 transition).

So far we considered Λ and M schemes of the type de-
scribed in Figs. 3a and 3c. Here the two-photon detun-
ings with respect to states
are equal and
b+i
|
opposite in sign and all the ﬁelds are treated classically.
This approach is useful for describing NMOR in alkali
atomic vapors. In general, however, M system may be
created by strongly nondegenerate atomic levels and all
four ﬁelds connecting corresponding atomic transitions
may be independent. This case is especially interesting
if we are going to use the enhanced Kerr nonlinearity the
system provides [46].

i

In this section we compare the N and M conﬁgura-
tions shown in Figs.1b and 1c. The N system is essen-
tially a Λ system with an additional nonresonant tran-
sition. Similarly the M system in Fig. 1c is a resonant
N system with an additional detuned transition. Since
these systems have potential applications in the ﬁeld of
quantum information processing, we discuss them here.
Some details concerning such systems have been given
earlier [45, 46]. The systems seems to be completely dif-
ferent because all-resonant N conﬁguration demonstrates
enhanced three-photon absorption, while all resonant M
conﬁguration demonstrates complete transparency. We
here show that performance of these schemes as sources
of refractive Kerr nonlinearity is rather very similar.

phase mismatch between diﬀerent photons arise as the

SUSCEPTIBILITIES FOR

INHOMOGENEOUSLY BROADENED Λ, N AND
M SYSTEMS

It is important to know what change Doppler broad-
ening introduces to the discussed above systems. For the
sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves by asymmetric
schemes discussed in the previous section. Let us start
with Doppler broadened Λ system shown in Fig.1a. This
system is widely discussed in the literature [49, 60, 61], so
we consider only necessary steps that allow us to calculate
susceptibility for Doppler broadened M conﬁguration.
To sustain EIT in Doppler-broadened Λ medium the min-

The nonlinear phase shift may be increased, formally, by
increasing atomic density or interaction length. This is
impossible to implement practically because of the ab-
sorption of the medium. Therefore, to compare a nonlin-
ear performance of diﬀerent nonlinear systems one needs
to compare ratio of their refractive nonlinearities and cor-
responding residual absorption, linear as well as nonlin-
ear. The eﬀective ratio between absorption and nonlin-
earity for the Doppler broadened N scheme (98) is Wd/∆.

VII. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE NMOR
WITH ELLIPTICALLY POLARIZED LIGHT IN
RB VAPOR

A. Experimental setup

The scheme of the experimental setup is shown on
Fig. 6. We use external cavity diode laser (ECDL) tuned
in the vicinity of D1 line of 87Rb (λ = 795nm). The
initial linear polarization is produced by the high-quality
polarizer P1; the initial ellipticity of the beam ǫ [62] is
then controlled by and the quarter wave-plate placed af-
ter the polarizer. Maximum laser power delivered to the
atomic cell is Pmax = 2mW. The glass cylindrical cell
with the length of 50mm and the diameter 25mm is ﬁlled
with isotopically enhanced 87Rb.
It is placed inside a
two-layer magnetic shield to avoid the inﬂuence of the
laboratory magnetic ﬁeld. The atomic density is con-
trolled by the heating element placed between two shield-
ing layers. The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is created by
the solenoid mounted inside the inner magnetic shield.

To measure the transmitted laser power and the po-
larization rotation angle the polarization beam splitter
(PBS) is placed after the atomic cell. The signals from
two PBS channels S1,2 are collected with the axis of the
PBS is tilted at 45o degrees with respect to the main
axis of the initial polarization ellipse. In this conﬁgura-
tion the transmitted light power is proportional to the

sum of two signals S1 + S2 and the polarization rotation
angle φ is equal:

φ =

arcsin

S2

S1 −
(S1 + S2) cos 2ǫ

(99)

It is also possible to detect the ellipticity of outgoing laser
beam by placing another quarter waveplate after the cell
before the PBS. Providing that the fast waveplate axis is
aligned with the PBS axis and makes 45o with the initial
polarization direction, the ellipticity ǫ of the beam can
be found similarly to the rotation angle:

ǫ =

arcsin

(100)

B. The experiments with 87Rb vapor

There are two factors contributing to the rotation of
the elliptical polarization of light propagating through
the Rb vapor: the nonlinear Faraday rotation, caused
by the shifts of the magnetic sublevels in external mag-
netic ﬁeld, and the self-rotation caused by the ac-Stark
shifts due to the oﬀ-resonant interaction of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld with far-detuned levels [63, 64, 65]. Since
the latter eﬀect does not depend on the magnetic ﬁeld,
we eliminate it from the experimental data either by mea-
suring procedure or by direct subtraction. In all further
discussions we concentrate on NMOR signals only.

Let us ﬁrst study the modiﬁcation of the polarization
rotation by measuring the rotation rate dφ
dB (B = 0) for
diﬀerent degree of light ellipticity. We ﬁnd the rotation
rate by dividing the diﬀerence of two rotation signals cor-
responding to the small variation of the magnetic ﬁeld
by the magnitude of this variation. This way we auto-
matically detect only the rotation which depends on the
external magnetic ﬁeld.

→

The rotation rate as a function light ellipticity is shown
in Fig. 7. As one can see we observe a polarization
rotation enhancement, predicted theoretically. At the
same time the experimental data cannot be ﬁtted using
the expression (77), because of the Doppler broadening
of the transition and the ac-Stark of the magnetic sub-
levels. The exact numerical simulation based on steady
state solution of Maxwell-Bloch equations for transition
F ′ = 1, which takes into account these eﬀects,
F = 2
is in the excellent agreement with the experimental data.
It is also possible to verify that there is no polariza-
tion rotation enhancement in the isolated Λ system. To
F ′ = 1 tran-
do that we tune the laser on the F = 1
sition of the 87Rb D1 line. The ground-state coherence
is formed only via one Λ link in this case. The rela-
F ′ = 1 transitions
tive rotation rate for F = 1, 2
are presented in Fig. 8. Although there is a slight de-
pendence of the rotation angle on the light ellipticity for
F ′ = 1 transition, this deterioration may be
F = 1
determined by Doppler broadening, ac-Stark shifts, etc.

→

→

→

12

It is important to point out that even though the theo-
retical expression for the relative rotation rate (Eq.(77))
does not ﬁt the experimental data precisely, it correctly
predict some of the rotation properties. For example, our
experiments conﬁrm that the relative rotation rate does
not depend on the sign of the ellipticity (Fig. 7). If we
vary the total laser power or the coherence decay rate γ0
(by varying the laser beam diameter), absolute value of
the rotation changes according to the theory (Eq.(76)),
its dependence on the light ellipticity is the same within
the experimental uncertainty (Figs. 7,10).

All previous data were obtained for optically thin Rb
0.85). The dependence
vapor (transmission Iout/Iin ≃
of the relative rotation rate on the ellipticity for diﬀerent
atomic densities is shown in Fig. 9. It is easy to see that
for nearly circular polarization the rotation is decreasing
if atomic density is increased. This may be caused by
the optical pumping to the other ground state hyperﬁne
level, as well as by the destruction of atomic coherence
by radiation trapping [66, 67].

The precise value of the output ellipticity of the laser
polarization is required for accurate polarization rotation
measurements (Eq.(99)). The experimental observations
demonstrate that for optically thin media the elliptic-
ity of the light does not noticeably change due to the
propagation eﬀects if the magnetic ﬁeld is small. As the
atomic density increases, however, the ellipticity is in-
creasing (Fig. 9b). Although this change is relatively
small (< 15%), the associated error in the calculated ro-
tation is very signiﬁcant.

C. Polarization rotation of the elliptically polarized
light for large magnetic ﬁelds

Now let us consider the case of large magnetic ﬁelds. If
the laser frequency is swept across the atomic transition,
the following eﬀects contributes to the polarization rota-
tion: nonlinear Faraday rotation due to Λ-scheme (exper-
imentally measured for linear polarization), self-rotation
of elliptical polarization due to ac-Stark shifts, and the
magneto-optic rotation of elliptical polarization due to
M -scheme induced coherence. All these components are
shown on Fig. 11. It is important to point out that this
“new” rotation is comparable with the polarization ro-
tation for the linear polarization and the self-rotation,
even though this eﬀect is due to the nonlinearity of the
higher order. This proves the eﬀectiveness of the M level
scheme for the enhancement of nonlinear susceptibility
in atomic media.

The dependence of the rotation due to the “M -scheme”
ground-state coherence on magnetic ﬁeld reveals a very
peculiar behavior. If in the vicinity of zero magnetic ﬁeld
the rotation is independent on the sign of ellipticity (as
it was demonstrated earlier), for larger magnetic ﬁeld
it becomes asymmetric with respect to both magnetic
ﬁeld and ellipticity. To invert the sign of the rotation,
both ellipticity and magnetic ﬁeld should change their

signs (Fig. 12a). The ellipticity of the outgoing light also
changes with the magnetic ﬁeld; although it is equal to
the initial ellipticity for small magnetic ﬁelds (at least for
optically thin samples) , it grows symmetrically while the
magnetic ﬁeld becomes larger (Fig. 12a). This changes
have to be taken into account when the polarization ro-
tation angle is measured.

D. NMOR for the atoms with higher angular
moments

As it is discussed in Section IV, the higher orders of
nonlinear susceptibility may be enhanced in multi-Λ sys-
tems. In practice this means that the atoms with bigger
ground state angular momentum are required. The most
convenient candidate for the study of the higher order
of Zeeman coherence is the diﬀerent isotope of Rb, since
the same laser may be used again. In our experiments
5P3/2F ′ = 2 of 85Rb; the inter-
we use 5S5/2F = 3
action scheme of the elliptically polarized light with this
transition consists of M scheme and triple-Λ scheme.

→

The relative rotation rate for this transition as a func-
tion of the light ellipticity is shown in Fig. 13. The polar-
ization rotation enhancement, observed in this case is no-
ticeably smaller than for 87Rb. The reason for that may
be the smaller hf splitting of the excited state (362 MHz
vs 812 MHz for 87Rb), which is completely overlapped
500 MHz). This
by the Doppler broadening (∆Doppler ≈
overlapping results in the eﬃcient ”mixing” of the co-
herences induced through diﬀerent excited states, which
may signiﬁcantly change the properties of the system.
That is why it would be very interesting to measure the
rotation due to high order coherence, discussed above, in
a cloud of cold atoms. In this case we expect to see much
stronger eﬀect (Eq.(82)), since all problems caused by
the motion of the atoms and the transitions overlapping
would be eliminated in cold gas.

The spectral dependence of the rotation of the elliptical
polarization on laser frequency for the case of large mag-
netic ﬁeld is presented of Fig. 14. Similarly to the 87Rb,
the high-order Zeeman coherence signiﬁcantly modiﬁes
the rotation spectra, and the contribution of the nonlin-
ear rotation is comparable with the rotation of the linear
polarization and self-rotation.

One can see the additional sub-Doppler structure on
top of the rotation resonances. These peaks appears
due to the retro-reﬂection of the laser beam inside the
atomic cell. This additional beam interacts with atoms
and causes the redistribution of the atomic population
similar to Doppler-free conﬁguration.

VIII. CONCLUSION

13

We have studied the nonlinear magneto-optic rota-
tion of elliptically polarized light interacting with various
transitions of rubidium atoms. We have shown that this
rotation can be described by means of Λ, M , and higher
chain Λ schemes. For the simple three-level Λ scheme
the rotation does not depend on the light ellipticity. For
the more complicated systems the multi-photon processes
are responsible for the creation of high order ground-state
coherence resulting in new type of ellipticity-dependent
nonlinear magneto-optical rotation. We have derived
simple analytical expressions for such rotation in the case
of M interaction scheme (Eq.(76)). We showed that this
eﬀect results from coherently induced hexadecapole mo-
ment.

Since the modiﬁcation of NMOR is associated with
an enhancement of nonlinear atomic susceptibility, we
have analyzed the eﬀectiveness of this process by com-
paring the nonlinear susceptibility for M and N inter-
action schemes. We have demonstrated that although
the enhancements of nonlinearity in these schemes are
caused by diﬀerent mechanisms, they exhibit the same
absorptive and refractive nonlinearity magnitudes. We
have also shown that generalized M scheme may be used
to create resonantly enhanced nonlinear susceptibility of
any given order, similarly to generalized N scheme [45].
We have discussed the possible implementation of gener-
alized M scheme for quantum computer algorithms.

To verify our theoretical calculations, we have stud-
ied the polarization rotation for the elliptically polarized
laser ﬁeld, propagating through the Rb vapor. The M
F ′ = 1 transi-
interaction scheme is realized on F = 2
F ′ = 2
tion of 87Rb, and triple-Λ scheme - on F = 3
transition of 87Rb. Although the experimental points
cannot be perfectly ﬁtted by the theoretical expressions
(Eqs.(32),(76)), the basic properties of the new rotation
are conﬁrmed.

FIG. 13: The normalized slope of nonlinear magneto-optic
rotation as a function of the ellipticity of the incident light
for F = 3 → F ′ = 2 transition of 85Rb (diamonds), and for
= 1 transition of 87Rb (circles). Input laser
F = 2 → F
power is P=2 mW, the atomic densities are chosen to provide
85% absorption on each transition. Absolute values of the
nonlinear Faraday rotation for the linear polarization were
dφ/dB(B = 0) = 2.9rad/G and 4.5rad/G correspondingly.
Inset: the theoretical dependences for naturally broadened Rb
isotopes, from Eq. (76, ??).

Laser detuning, GHz

FIG. 14: The polarization rotation angle in 85Rb atomic cell
as a function of laser detuning for ellipticity ǫ = 25o and
magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.35G. The components of the rotation
due to various processes are also shown. The zero detuning
corresponds to cross-resonance F = 3 → F ′ = 2.3 transition.
The distortions of the resonances are due to reﬂected light
beam.

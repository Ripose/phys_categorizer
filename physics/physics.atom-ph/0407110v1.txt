Abstract. The evolution of pionium, the π+π− hydrogen-like atom while passing
through mater is solved within the density matrix formalism in the ﬁrst Born
approximation. We compare the inﬂuence on the pionium lifetime between the
standard break-up probability calculations and the more precise picture of the density
matrix formalism accounting for interference eﬀects. We focus our general result in
the particular conditions of the DIRAC experiment at CERN.

Dynamics of the Pionium with the Density Matrix Formalism

1. Introduction

The evolution of pionium, the hydrogen-like atom formed by a π+π− pairs, in a material
target has been thoroughly studied in the recent years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] due to its
crucial implications in the DIRAC-PS 212 experiment [8]. This experiment is devoted
to measure the lifetime of pionium, intimately linked to the strong interaction scattering
lengths as we will see in section 2, testing the predictions of the Chiral Perturbation
Theory on these magnitudes.

The

transport of pionium in mater has been always

treated using a
classic probabilistic picture neglecting the quantum mechanics interference between
degenerated states with the same energy.
In the case of hydrogen-like atoms this is
of particular importance since the accidental degeneracy of the hamiltonian increases
the amount of states among which the interference can be signiﬁcative.

In [9] the density matrix formalism has been used to propose a new set of equations
for the pionium evolution accounting for the interference eﬀects. In this work we have
solved these equations and analyzed the consequences for the framework of DIRAC
experiment.

2. The Problem of Pionium in Matter

Due to the short lifetime of the pion, pionium, the hydrogen-like π+π− atom can not
be produced at rest in the laboratory frame. However, pionium can be originated in
collisions of high-energy projectiles with a ﬁxed target. The production cross section is
given in [10]:

The state of pionium is deﬁned by the center of mass momentum ~P and the
eigenstate quantum numbers, ni, li and mi, of the hydrogen-like hamiltonian. For
simplicity, in this work we have chosen to work with monochromatic atoms of 4.6 GeV/c,
the mean value of laboratory momentum of pionium in DIRAC, moving in the z axis
direction. The eﬀect of using the experimental pionium laboratory momentum spectrum
is small as shown in [7]. The yield of a particular state is proportional to its wave function
squared at the origin. It has been shown [11] that the eﬀect of the strong interaction
between the two pions of the atom signiﬁcantly modiﬁes
in comparison to the pure
Coulomb wave function. However, the ratio between the production rate in diﬀerent
states has been demonstrated to be kept as for the Coulomb wave functions [12]. Thus,
considering that the Coulomb functions obey

we see that only S states are created following the 1/n3

i law.

The atom moves in a ﬁxed thickness target disposed in the Oz axis and considered
inﬁnite in the transverse (x, y) coordinates. The target is made of a chemically pure
material like Nickel, Platinum or Titanium. Our goal is to know the population
probability of every bound state as a function of the position in the target, z, and
from this extract other results as the break-up probability. Usually a classical approach
is used to solve this problem [2, 6]. It consists of considering the total σtot
i and transition
between two discrete states σi,l cross sections for a pionium-target atom scattering and
apply the probabilistic evolution equation:

target atoms per unit of volume, and ci,l are the transition coeﬃcients.

The value of n0 is a function of the density of the target, ρ, the Avogadro number,

N0, and the atomic mass of the target atoms, A:

while the transition coeﬃcients depend on the pionium-target atom cross sections as:

The pionium decay is strongly dominated (BR > 99% [10]) by the π+π−

between the two pions. Of course, the width of a state holds Γi = τ −1
i where τi is the
corresponding lifetime of the state. Due to (2) we can see that pionium only decays
from S states and the lifetime of any S state is related to the lifetime of the ground
state:

τn00 = n3τ.

The lifetime of pionium is hence the only parameter to be inputed in the evolution
equation and can be related to any of its outputs. In particular we will link it to the
break-up probability. The experimental result of DIRAC will be used to test with 5%
accuracy the accurate Chiral Perturbation Theory prediction of a0

which leads to the lifetime value of τ = (2.9

3. The Density Matrix Evolution Equation

Equation (3) has been accurately solved obtaining the eigenvalues and the
eigenvectors [2] and also with Monte Carlo [7] for the bound states with n < 8, which is
enough to precisely calculate the break-up probability as explained in [7]. However, the
work of Voskresenskaya [9] demonstrates that the use of the classic probabilistic picture
might be inaccurate. This is because (3) neglects the quantum interference between the
pionium states during their passage through the target.

A more precise description of the system dynamics is given in terms of the density

matrix ρik. The evolution equation in this formalism is given by [9]:

where εk indicates the bounding energy of the k state and Ωik,lm stands for the transition
coeﬃcients matrix. This equation reduces to (3), identifying ρii(z) = Pi(z), if the Ωik,lm
crossed terms obeying i

= m were zero.

= k or l

The goal of this work is to solve this equation and determine how it corrects (3) for
the particular conditions of DIRAC experiment, namely for the result of the break-up
probability.

4. The Matrix Elements

To calculate the matrix elements ci,l and Ωik,lm we have applied the coherent pure
electrostatic ﬁrst Born approximation approach. Even though it is known that
relativistic and multiphoton exchange must be accounted to achieve the precision of
1% [7] our goal was to check wether quantum interference is a relevant eﬀect. For this
we will show that pure electrostatic ﬁrst Born approximation is enough.

The expression for the pionium-target cross sections in the electrostatic ﬁrst Born
approximation, used in the classical picture, was obtained by S. Mr´owczy´nski time

where q is the transferred momentum between the target and the pionic atoms. The
cross section does only depend on the two transverse coordinates of the momentum due
to the symmetry of the collision with respect to the scattering axis. We have chosen the

Equations (14) and (15) are our main tool for the numerical calculations and their

development from the original formulas of [9] can be followed in Appendix A.

4.1. Selection Rules and Transition Elements Examples

As pointed out in [9], and due to the properties of the form factors under the parity
transformation, the Ωik,lm coeﬃcients are diﬀerent from zero only if:

lk −

mi −

mk −

ll + lm = 2s

ml + mm = 0 ,

li −
where we should remember that mi(k,l,m) and li(k,l,m) are the magnetic and orbital
. The index s is an arbitrary integral number.
quantum numbers of the states
For the election of the Oz axis as the quantization axis the transitions between
states of diﬀerent z-parity are strongly suppressed [2]. This means that only states with
even l
m will be populated since pionium is produced in S states only. This, together
with (16) means that:

i(k, l, m)

which produces an oscillatory term in the solutions. However, for the ground and lowest
excited states the condition:

holds and the ρik(z) solution oscillates many times in a small interval, compared to the
electromagnetic transition range (given by n0 |
) and can be considered to average
as zero:

Ωik,ik|

There is an exception if the i and k states belong to the same shell since the energy of
the hydrogen-like system does only depend on the principal quantum number. In this
case εk −

εi = 0. Hence, for the low energy states, we can complete relation (17) as:

ρik(z)

= 0 if

εi = εi (ni = nk) , mi = mk ,

li = lk + 2s.

for ρ|100ih200| it does not oscillate at all for ρ|600ih700| in a wide range.

Cutting the number of considered states does only slightly aﬀect the solution of the last
two cores taken into account (in this case states with n = 6 and n = 7) as shown in [6].
To achieve a very good accuracy in the ﬁnal results we have considered a sequence

of step lengths in the numerical integration of the system:

The P picture in this equation is restored by changing ρii(z)

results are shown as a function of the principal and angular quantum number summed
over the magnetic quantum number m for a 95 µm Nickel target. The diﬀerences are
not very large, especially for the ground and lowest excited states. However, for some
particular states the diﬀerence can be up to 20%. In ﬁgure 3 we see the discrepancy for
the case of the

bound states and annihilate. However, they can also be transferred, in a collision
with a target atom, into a continuum state. The coeﬃcients ci,l and Ωik,lm accounting
for transitions between discrete and continuum states are more diﬃcult to compute
than the discrete-discrete ones since the atomic form factors have a more complicate
expression [3]. However, as shown in [6] for the case of the probabilistic picture, the
direct calculation of break-up probability from the systems solutions is not satisfactory
since it decreases very slowly as a function of the principal quantum number of the
broken discrete state and only a ﬁnite number of shells (n
7) are considered when
solving either (3) and (8). We would have to guess the break up probability for any
shell with n > 7 and make a large error in the total break-up probability determination.
The standard strategy to obtain break-up probability consists of calculating the

≤

r
Dynamics of the Pionium with the Density Matrix Formalism

probability of the atom to leave the target in a discrete state (Pdsc) and the probability
of annihilation (Panh) and make use of the relation:

1 = Pbr + Pdsc + Panh.

As both Pdsc and Panh quickly decrease with n we have an accurate result taking into
7. A small correction will be introduced for P n>7
account only those events with n
dsc .
In the experimental conditions the atoms are not created at the target beginning
but uniformly distributed along the target thickness. The probability that the atom
leaves the target in a discrete state can be however linked to the solutions under (20)
initial conditions by:

where W stands for the target thickness (of 95 µm in our case).

The annihilation probability is a little bit more diﬃcult to calculate. If the atom
is created in z0, the probability that it ﬂies to z and annihilates is given by Γiρii. But z
can be any value between z0 and the target end W . Meanwhile, the atom is randomly
created between 0 and W with uniform distribution, then the annihilation probability
is given by:

6. Discussion and Conclusions

We have checked that in the conditions of the DIRAC experiment the eﬀect of
the quantum interference between states does not change the result of the break-up
probability of pionium in the target. Hence, the results obtained in the classical picture
are accurate enough to safely perform the experimental measurement.

The unchanged result of break-up result takes place despite the fact that for some
, the eﬀect of interference can signiﬁcantly change the population
discrete states, as
of the state up to 20% levels. However, the most aﬀected states are very unpopulated
and hence not relevant for the ﬁnal results.

The situation could change if the initial conditions were not that most atoms are
created in the ground state. The later is non degenerated and interferences only show-
up after a ﬁrst transition. However we have checked what would happen if the initial
state and neither found a
conditions were that all the atoms were created in the
signiﬁcant change with the probabilistic approach. A possible explanation is that while
the interference is most likely with states with the same magnetic quantum number m,
and comparable with the transition cross sections, the dominant transitions are those
that increase l and m in one unit, free of interference with the father state.

Appendix A. The Ω matrix elements in the First Born Approximation

Let us show how to obtain the discrete matrix elements of the Ω matrix in the ﬁrst Born
approximation from the original equations of [9]. The Ω operator is originally deﬁned
as a function of the transverse position of the atom wave functions ~s1,2. If we split the
operator in two:

Ω( ~s1, ~s2) = Ω(1)( ~s1, ~s2) + Ω(2)( ~s1, ~s2),

(A.1)

Dynamics of the Pionium with the Density Matrix Formalism

its deﬁnition will be given by:

Ω(1)( ~s1, ~s2) =

Γ(~b, ~s1) + Γ∗(~b, ~s2)

d2b,

In the case of the π+π−-atom the interaction operator of the Glauber theory is given
by:

being U(r) the potential of the target atoms given by the inverse Fourier transform
of (11).

First of all we are going to re-write Ω(1)( ~s1, ~s2). For that we split Γ(~b, ~s) into its

real and imaginary part:

Γ(~b, ~s1(2)) = Re Γ(~b, ~s1(2)) + i Im Γ(~b, ~s1(2)),

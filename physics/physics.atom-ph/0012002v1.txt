Abstract

A theory of pump-probe spectroscopy is developed in which optical ﬁelds

drive two-photon Raman transitions between ground states of an ensemble

of three-level Λ atoms. Eﬀects related to the recoil the atoms undergo as a

result of their interactions with the ﬁelds are fully accounted for in this theory.

The linear absorption coeﬃcient of a weak probe ﬁeld in the presence of two

pump ﬁelds of arbitrary strength is calculated. For subrecoil cooled atoms,

the spectrum consists of eight absorption lines and eight emission lines. In the

limit that χ1 ≪
ﬁelds, one recovers the absorption spectrum for a probe ﬁeld interacting with

χ2, where χ1 and χ2 are the Rabi frequencies of the two pump

an eﬀective two-level atom in the presence of a single pump ﬁeld. However

when χ1 & χ2, new interference eﬀects arise that allow one to selectively turn

on and oﬀ some of these recoil induced resonances.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been interest in special features that can be attributed to

the recoil that atoms undergo on the absorption, emission, or scattering of radiation. One

example of such phenomena is recoil induced resonances (RIR) [1-8], which occur when a

weak probe and strong pump ﬁeld interact with an ensemble of two level atoms having

transition frequency ω. We ﬁrst recall some relevant results, neglecting eﬀects related to

atomic recoil. In this limit, the sum of the ground state and excited state population for

each velocity subclass of atoms is conserved. Let Ω1 and Ωp be the frequencies of the pump

and probe ﬁelds, respectively, ∆ = Ω1 −
χ1 the Rabi frequency of the pump ﬁeld, and δ = Ωp −
limit that

δ = 0. The absorption and emission peaks can be easily interpreted in terms of dressed states

of the atom and pump ﬁeld [9]. The interpretation of the dispersive-like structure centered

at δ = 0 is somewhat more elusive (see [10]). For the moment, we focus on the secular terms

and neglect the non-secular terms.

The absorption spectrum can undergo a dramatic change when eﬀects related to the recoil

atoms undergo as a result of absorbing or emitting radiation are included [3]. In the case of

subrecoil cooled atoms for which eﬀects of Doppler broadening may be ignored, the secular

absorption and emission lines of the probe spectrum are each replaced by absorption-emission

doublets. In addition, there appear two secular absorption-emission doublets centered at

δ = 0. An example of this spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. The secular spectrum can be

given a simple interpretation in terms of dressed states of the atom and pump ﬁeld, taking

into account atomic recoil [3]. For the eight lines to be fully resolvable, it is necessary that

4ωk & γe where ωk = ~k2/2m is the recoil energy associated with the emission or absorption

of a photon from either the pump or probe ﬁeld (the wave vectors for the pump and probe

have the same magnitude but opposite sign). If ωk ≪

γe/4, the absorption-emission doublet

A2 and B2 collapse into a single emission line, and absorption and emission lines B+ and

B− cancel one another. However, the lines A+ and A− are resolved provided [3],

that ωk/γe = 0.0025 [11]. Consequently, to fully resolve the recoil induced changes in the

probe spectrum would require the use of electric dipole forbidden transitions. If one instead

considers two-photon Raman transitions between ground states of a three-level Λ-type atom,

the widths of the spectral lines are determined by some eﬀective ground state decay rate

such as the inverse of the time the atom spends interacting with the pump and probe ﬁelds.

As a result, the recoil induced structure in the probe spectrum is fully resolvable.

In this paper we present a scheme for observing RIR in pump-probe spectroscopy of an

atomic vapor using Raman transitions with two pump ﬁelds and a weak probe. This scheme

is based on the model developed in [12] but for which all eﬀects associated with atomic

recoil were ignored. We consider the case of subrecoil cooled atoms in which the magnitude

of the two-photon recoil momentum is greater than the width of the atomic momentum

distribution, i.e. Mu

~q, where u is the most probable speed of the atoms and q is the

magnitude of the diﬀerence between the probe and pump wave vectors. An alternative form

for this condition is kBT

~ωq where T = Mu2/2kB is an eﬀective temperature for the

atoms and ~ωq now represents the recoil energy associated with a two-photon transition.

As in [12], the probe spectrum displays interference eﬀects. The interference allows one

to selectively turn on and oﬀ the individual lines in the absorption-emission doublets at δ

0

∼

by controlling the ratio of the pump ﬁeld Rabi frequencies and the sign of their detunings

relative to the excited state transition.

In Sect. II, a model is developed for the interaction of the atoms with the pump ﬁelds

and dressed states of the atom plus pump ﬁelds are deﬁned. In Sect. III, the interaction with

the probe ﬁeld is introduced. Section IV contains the calculation of the linear absorption

coeﬃcient of the probe as well as examples of the probe spectrum for various experimental

parameters. Moreover, in this section it is shown that the various spectral components can

be obtained by inspection from the dressed states in the secular limit. Finally, in Sect. V

we discuss the physical origin of the interference as well as possible applications.

The conﬁguration of the atom and ﬁelds is indicated schematically in Fig.2. The pump

ﬁelds 1 and 2 are denoted by the coupling constants g1 and g2, respectively. The pump

ﬁeld 1 couples only state

1 > and excited state

e >, while pump 2 couples only state

|

|

and

e >. The interaction of the probe ﬁeld, Ep, which couples only state

1 > and

2 >

|
e > is

|

|

discussed in the next section. In this section, we consider only the interaction of the pump

ﬁelds with the atoms.

The ground state levels

1 > and

2 > are pumped incoherently at rates Λ1(p) and Λ2(p),

|

|

respectively, and the population of both states decay with rate γ. The eﬀect of collisional

dephasing is ignored so the coherences between

1 > and

2 > also decay with rate γ. If

1 >

|
2 > represent stable ground states of the atom, then the pumping rates and decay rate

|

|

and

γ constitute a simple model for the ﬁnite interaction time of the atoms with the ﬁelds due

to the velocity of the atoms transverse to the propagation direction of the ﬁelds. Owing to

spontaneous emission, the population in the excited state decays at a rate γe ≫

γ.

In contrast to [12] but as in [3], we use a quantized description of the pump ﬁelds. This

is not necessary, but the calculation is physically more transparent using quantized pump

the cI’s in the interaction representation.

It turns out that the matrix elements and dressed state energies can be used to obtain

directly the absorption or gain proﬁles in the secular limit. However in the more general case

it is necessary to solve for the various density matrix elements. The dressed state density

It is assumed that all the elements of the density matrix decay at the same rate, γ. This

assumption is certainly valid for an atomic beam that is perpendicular to the applied ﬁelds,

since the atom-ﬁeld interaction does not alter the transit time of the atoms through the

IV. ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT

In this section the absorption coeﬃcient for the probe ﬁeld is calculated. Before embark-

ing on a rigorous calculation of the absorption coeﬃcient, it is helpful to present a simpliﬁed

approach that provides an intuitive understanding of the line shapes in the secular limit.

A. Secular Limit

In the secular limit, one may set ΛAB = 0. The absorption coeﬃcient, α, is proportional

to the rate at which energy is absorbed from (α > 0) or emitted into (α < 0) the probe

ﬁeld. For a transition induced by the probe between the initial state I and ﬁnal state J,

the absorption is determined by the number of atoms excited into state J. The absorption

coeﬃcient will be proportional to N~ΩpγρJJ /

2 where ρJJ is the steady state population

produced in state J due to the I

J transition and N is the atom density. It is easy to

→

see from Eq. (36) that ρJJ is equal to

and then extract ρ+

12(p; p′) and ρ+

11(p; p′) from these solutions using Eqs. (49a-49b). The

general structure of the solution is linked to the incoherent pumping of levels 1 and 2. For

a subrecoil cooled vapor, the pumping rate density for density matrix elements ρij(p; p′) is

assumed to be

(52)

where Λ′

iV −1 has the dimensions of (volume

rate to state 1 or 2 in position space. With this form of pumping, ρI

ij(p; p′), must be
~k′) where k′ is some algebraic combination of the pump and

proportional to δ(p

p′

−
probe ﬁeld propagation vectors. To obtain ρ

−

′

1e from Eq. (51) using Eq. (42), one must keep

only those terms in the integrand of Eq. (51) proportional to δ (p

p′) . In this limit, the

−

ρ(0)
11 (p; p) term in Eq. (51) makes no contribution to the absorption since it is real and will

be ignored from this point on.

The incoherent pumping of states 1 and 2 populate two diﬀerent manifolds. The pumping

of state 1 populates the (p = 0, n1, n2) manifold while the pumping of state 2 populates the

(p =

~k12, n1, n2) manifold since this manifold involves state 2 with zero momentum. Thus

−

in viewing absorption or emission, two distinct initial state manifolds must be included,

leading to the possibility of sixteen rather than eight components of the spectrum. For the

time being we set Λ2 = 0 but will remove this restriction in the next section.

The terms appearing in Eq. (51) may be expressed in terms of the dressed state density

matrix elements. The matrix elements in VId which couple the 0 and 1 manifolds all have

the time dependence e±iω(1)t while those which couple the 0 and 2 manifolds have a e±iω(2)t

time dependence (see appendix). Consequently, if one is interested only in terms linear in χp,

one can expand the dressed state density matrix to ﬁrst order in the VId matrix elements,

The reason the absorption coeﬃcient is expressible as a sum of the secular term plus a non-

the oﬀ-diagonal components of Λ0. Since the ﬁrst order solutions, ρ+

in the pumping terms,

contain terms proportional to ΛA and ΛB while

proportional to ΛAB. This simpliﬁcation would not occur for a more complex decay scheme

The ﬁrst four resonances in

One important diﬀerence is that for γe ≫

lead to absorption or gain in Ep. This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

Because the two lines in the doublets have diﬀerent strengths, one can adjust ψ and η to turn

oﬀ one of the lines. For example, the absorption doublet, L1 and L4, consists of the lines at

A particularly interesting case occurs when k1 ≈

k2 so that ω(0)

AB = ω(1)

AB = ω(2)

AB and θ0 =

θ1 = θ2. This would correspond to a two-photon pump ﬁeld which imparts no momentum to

the atoms so that the recoil splitting in the absorption spectrum can be attributed solely to

the recoil due to the two two-photon probe ﬁelds, kp2 = kp1. In this case, the line L1 (∆′) is

degenerate with L4 (∆′) and L5 (∆′) is degenerate with L8 (∆′) . Consequently, the spectrum

consists of three absorption-emission doublets centered at ∆′ = 0, +ω(0)
AB,

ω(0)
AB. Moreover,

−

the lines within each doublet are split by 2ω~kp1 which is independent of the strength or

detuning of the pump ﬁelds.

When the eﬀects of atomic recoil are neglected by setting all recoil momenta to zero in

α
α0

, one obtains the same absorption spectrum given in [12]. The absorption coeﬃcient

(cid:16)
given here can also be shown to be consistent with the results given in [3] in the limit in

V. DISCUSSION

Pumping to state 2 at a rate Λ2 introduces a new set of manifolds. However, with the

exception of doubling the number of absorption and emission lines in the probe spectrum,

the new manifolds do not result in any qualitatively new features. To understand this, ﬁrst

note that pumping to

absolute number of photons in the pump ﬁelds is unimportant, only the diﬀerence in the

photon number between manifolds is relevant.

Consequently, all of the results derived in this paper may be immediately used to derive

the absorption coeﬃcient for the transitions between the ¯0 manifold and the ¯1 and ¯2 mani-

folds through the substitution, p

1 since the dressed states have equal population (see [12]).

In Ref. [12] interference eﬀects similar to those in Eq. (55b) were found.

It was not

obvious that the interference would persist for Fock states of the pump ﬁelds. Nor was it

obvious that the interference would survive quantization of the center of mass motion, since

24

b

|

diﬀerent ﬁelds impart diﬀerent momenta to the atoms. The interference is not lost since the

ﬁnal states for processes involving the probe ﬁeld and pump ﬁeld 1 are the same as those

involving the probe ﬁeld and pump ﬁeld 2.

The existence of total destructive interference for particular values of η and ψ in Eq. (55b)

can also be interpreted in terms of dark states. Consider a Λ type atom with an excited

state

c > and ground states

a > and

b > in the presence of some interaction represented

|

|

|

by an operator

V which couples each of the ground states to the excited state but does not

couple the two ground states to each other. In this case, a dark state corresponds to an

initial superposition of the two ground states,

(60)

(61)

Ψdark >= sin θ

a > +eiφ cos θ

b >,

|

|

|

such that the transition probability to the excited state is identically zero for all times. This

corresponds to the condition

< c

V

Ψdark >

0.

|

|

b

In the context of the system described here, the coherence between the ground states

within the 0, 1, and 2 manifolds needed to produce a dark state is provided by the dressing

with the pump ﬁelds, i.e. the dressed states

Ai > and

Bi > are superpositions of the bare

|

|

states

1 > and

2 > of the same form as Eq. (60). Since the probe only couples to state

1 >, the transitions leading to probe absorption (gain) involve matrix elements between

1 > in the 0 (2) manifold and the dressed states in the 1 (0) manifold. For certain

values of the dressed state angles and ψ, it is possible to satisfy the condition for a dark

state given in Eq. (61).

First, consider probe absorption which involves transitions from

1, p; n1, n2 > to either

|

A1 > or

B1 >. The square of the matrix elements of VI corresponding to these transitions

The expressions on the right are precisely the absorption interference terms in Eq. (55b).

Therefore, for certain values of θ1 relative to ψ and η,

A1 > or

B1 > correspond to

|

|

”inverted dark states”. These are called ”inverted dark states” since this is an eﬀective V

type system with excited states

1, p + ~kp1; n1 + 1, n2 > and

2, p + ~(k12 + kp1); n1, n2 +

In a similar manner, probe emission involves transitions between

Bose-Einstein condensates would represent an interesting application of the ideas pre-

sented here. Bragg spectroscopy has recently been demonstrated in condensates [15] [16] as

well as the stimulated generation of matter waves in a condensate by Rayleigh scattering

[17]. In a condensate, the strength of the absorption and emission lines should be enhanced

since the scattering of atoms out of the condensate state and into a recoil side-mode is a

stimulated process with a rate proportional to the number of atoms in the side-mode [18]. In

addition, the RIR spectrum of a weakly interacting Bose condensate should yield information

about the spectrum of elementary excitations in a condensate. This would have important

implications, since it would provide a new means for determining the excitation spectrum

which determines the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of a condensate.

Figure 1. Probe absorption coeﬃcient in arbitrary units versus probe-pump detuning

with the inclusion of recoil. In units of the excited state decay rate γe,the pump detuning

is ∆ = 50, pump ﬁeld Rabi frequency is χ1 = 75, and the recoil frequency is ωk = 5. The

decay rate for the ground state is taken to be zero. See Ref. [3].

Figure 3. (a) Transitions between the 0 manifold and the 1 and 2 manifolds leading to

probe gain or absorption in the bare state picture. The states in the 1 and 2 manifolds

are displaced from the states in the 0 manifold by an amount

shown are those which couple the states from the 0 manifold to the 1 and 2 manifolds. (b)

Energy levels in the dressed state basis. The center of the 1 manifold has an energy ~ω10

above the center of the 0 manifold and similarly, the center of the 2 manifold is ~ω20 below

the 0 manifold.(c) Illustration of the coupling of the pump and probe ﬁelds to the dressed
